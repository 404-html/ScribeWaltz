1
00:00:25,380 --> 00:00:30,380
I think that the story of Simba is an a
typical and mythological story,

2
00:00:30,481 --> 00:00:35,100
not only about the hero's journey,
but more importantly about the meaning

3
00:00:35,130 --> 00:00:38,100
of growing up.
When Tim was born in the opening of the

4
00:00:38,101 --> 00:00:40,720
film,
he is held up to look out over off

5
00:00:40,770 --> 00:00:43,380
Africa's wildlife who bow down before
him,

6
00:00:43,410 --> 00:00:46,350
freedom him with all respect and
obedience.

7
00:00:46,770 --> 00:00:50,510
From a Freudian perspective,
this is a wonderful allegory for Freud's

8
00:00:50,550 --> 00:00:53,010
concept of his majesty,
the baby.

9
00:00:53,070 --> 00:00:56,670
When a child is born,
the first stage of his life is one of

10
00:00:56,700 --> 00:00:58,940
infantile omnipotence,
vr.

11
00:00:58,950 --> 00:01:03,090
At first it needs of knowing we are
special and the central focus of our

12
00:01:03,091 --> 00:01:05,910
parents care and concern.
At this point,

13
00:01:05,911 --> 00:01:08,910
we cannot see beyond our own needs in
the lion king,

14
00:01:08,911 --> 00:01:11,040
Simba is not only the center of his
parents,

15
00:01:11,041 --> 00:01:13,800
universe birth,
he is bound down before by the whole

16
00:01:13,801 --> 00:01:15,330
assembled African wildlife.

17
00:01:15,820 --> 00:01:19,000
Everything that like touches is our
kingdom.

18
00:01:21,550 --> 00:01:25,570
A King's time is ruler rises and falls
like the sun.

19
00:01:26,260 --> 00:01:30,970
One day Simba,
the Sun will set on my time here and

20
00:01:30,971 --> 00:01:35,971
will rise with you as the new king.
Everything

21
00:01:39,950 --> 00:01:41,750
this,
however it creates a problem.

22
00:01:41,780 --> 00:01:45,170
Thanks to his father's rule.
The pride lands are imbalance.

23
00:01:45,440 --> 00:01:49,220
Simba is this born in paradise and in
his infant they'll nip Athens.

24
00:01:49,221 --> 00:01:51,380
He is the center of it.
Therefore,

25
00:01:51,381 --> 00:01:54,410
there's nothing to prove himself,
nothing to conquer.

26
00:01:54,800 --> 00:01:57,620
Hence his fascination with the elephants
grief yards.

27
00:01:57,710 --> 00:02:00,320
Here,
he can defy parental authority and show

28
00:02:00,321 --> 00:02:04,790
his bravery birth where his father's
bravery is a mature connection with the

29
00:02:04,791 --> 00:02:09,440
danger and the possibility of death.
Simba in his infantile omnipotence has

30
00:02:09,441 --> 00:02:12,980
no real connection to these things.
A suit characterize argues in the

31
00:02:12,981 --> 00:02:17,150
Journal of child psychotherapy.
Adolescent risk taking is so often off

32
00:02:17,151 --> 00:02:20,120
this nature.
It's a dare send out into the world to

33
00:02:20,121 --> 00:02:24,830
show that we are immune to vulnerability
without any real emotional connection to

34
00:02:24,831 --> 00:02:26,840
the dangerous.
We pretend to disdain

35
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:30,640
being brave.
It doesn't mean you go looking for

36
00:02:30,641 --> 00:02:32,750
trouble.
You're not scared of anything

37
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:37,180
I was today.
Yes,

38
00:02:38,320 --> 00:02:39,640
I thought I might lose you.

39
00:02:41,070 --> 00:02:45,900
Of course this cannot last and to
reality of danger and death is trusted

40
00:02:45,901 --> 00:02:50,670
in December's life in a haunting way
when Mufasa dies while trying to save

41
00:02:50,671 --> 00:02:54,930
Simba due to a plot by my father's
brother's car is from a rational

42
00:02:54,931 --> 00:02:58,230
perspective,
rather unclear why Simba feel so guilty

43
00:02:58,231 --> 00:03:00,960
about his father's death.
He listened to scar wader.

44
00:03:00,970 --> 00:03:04,870
It's where it was still so wait for his
father and he didn't cost the stampede.

45
00:03:05,230 --> 00:03:10,230
So one argument is that felt unworthy of
being saved and worthy of his father's

46
00:03:11,321 --> 00:03:12,600
sacrifice.
Well,

47
00:03:12,610 --> 00:03:16,980
Fossa seems to rue flawlessly.
He is a constant reminder of what Simba

48
00:03:16,981 --> 00:03:20,490
is not brave,
strong and wise after symbols,

49
00:03:20,540 --> 00:03:24,400
filter tend to prove himself worthy in
the elephants' graveyard it's facing

50
00:03:24,401 --> 00:03:26,980
now.
He knows his arrogance and infantile

51
00:03:26,981 --> 00:03:30,850
omnipotence fades away and he feels
unworthy both of his father,

52
00:03:30,851 --> 00:03:33,880
his sacrifice and his destiny off being
king,

53
00:03:34,150 --> 00:03:38,780
so he runs
run away.

54
00:03:40,510 --> 00:03:43,990
Another key argument for skills is
Freudian oedipal teary,

55
00:03:44,140 --> 00:03:48,640
where fruit argues to wish of songs to
replace and take the positions of the

56
00:03:48,641 --> 00:03:50,230
father's dad.
You shouldn't.

57
00:03:54,110 --> 00:03:56,510
In the beginning of the film.
Timber in this arrogance,

58
00:03:56,511 --> 00:04:00,530
Singh's office wished to become king.
This of course implies determining his

59
00:04:00,531 --> 00:04:05,480
father or his father dying as was also
realized by on the strader's when the

60
00:04:05,481 --> 00:04:06,500
parody to song

61
00:04:06,650 --> 00:04:07,860
hello.
Hi.

62
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:16,220
Simba is either consciously or
unconsciously aware of his wish to

63
00:04:16,221 --> 00:04:19,130
replace his father,
which feeds his feelings of guilt for

64
00:04:19,131 --> 00:04:20,870
his father's death.
Therefore,

65
00:04:20,871 --> 00:04:25,040
in an attempt to escape his guilt,
he runs away from his father's position

66
00:04:25,041 --> 00:04:27,170
as king.
He this rinse away,

67
00:04:27,410 --> 00:04:30,800
but it's not only from the private lands
and it's right for places king,

68
00:04:30,830 --> 00:04:34,550
but also from all the personality traits
his father embodied.

69
00:04:34,890 --> 00:04:36,910
Yeah,
got to put your past behind.

70
00:04:36,911 --> 00:04:40,900
You look at bad things happen and you
can't do anything about it.

71
00:04:40,930 --> 00:04:41,770
Right,
right,

72
00:04:41,950 --> 00:04:45,160
wrong.
When the world turns its back on you,

73
00:04:45,340 --> 00:04:47,560
you turn your back on Delaware.

74
00:04:47,860 --> 00:04:51,610
It is here that Simba anthers and
adolescent phase where he chooses

75
00:04:51,611 --> 00:04:55,870
escapism in pleasure,
discarding any responsibility he joins a

76
00:04:55,871 --> 00:05:00,760
gang or fourth categorized describes as
a sexual dropouts where the prevailing

77
00:05:00,761 --> 00:05:04,870
wisdom is not to worry about any
consequences of one's actions.

78
00:05:09,910 --> 00:05:13,050
Dan,
a problem three

79
00:05:19,500 --> 00:05:22,080
this way.
Similar defense himself from his guilt

80
00:05:22,110 --> 00:05:26,460
by cutting himself off from the past and
immersing himself in living in the

81
00:05:26,461 --> 00:05:29,130
moment.
It's quite telling that in this sequence

82
00:05:29,131 --> 00:05:33,060
Simba turns to eating bugs and just
having his Neil's faults by [inaudible]

83
00:05:33,540 --> 00:05:36,360
where Simba first envied his father
strength,

84
00:05:36,420 --> 00:05:39,780
power and aggression and tried to
emulate those traits,

85
00:05:39,920 --> 00:05:42,630
no fuels,
these traits and his rivalry with his

86
00:05:42,631 --> 00:05:45,510
father were responsible for his father's
death.

87
00:05:45,810 --> 00:05:48,570
Therefore he relinquishes his
competitiveness,

88
00:05:48,571 --> 00:05:53,160
healthy aggression and ambition in fear
that he cannot control these traits and

89
00:05:53,190 --> 00:05:57,380
we'll become destructive.
Simba at this point is not aware that

90
00:05:57,381 --> 00:06:01,670
giving up these traits has a cost as
well and that it is not the solution.

91
00:06:01,970 --> 00:06:05,810
If we give up our ambition,
competitiveness and aggression for

92
00:06:05,811 --> 00:06:09,170
escape pleasure,
we cannot develop ourselves fully and

93
00:06:09,171 --> 00:06:12,170
take our place in the world in an
escapist position,

94
00:06:12,171 --> 00:06:16,190
we will remain self centered and enabled
to help those around us.

95
00:06:16,220 --> 00:06:19,400
Eventually both our own lives and our
surroundings,

96
00:06:19,401 --> 00:06:23,210
we all start falling apart as Jordan
Peterson states.

97
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:25,970
You know,
we have this strange idea that's

98
00:06:25,971 --> 00:06:29,660
especially again foisted on young men
that the pathway to virtue is through

99
00:06:29,661 --> 00:06:33,920
weakness and harmlessness and that's
just simply not true that that that's

100
00:06:33,921 --> 00:06:36,400
the pathway to uselessness and
resentment.

101
00:06:36,790 --> 00:06:40,250
Cimbar realizes this when Nala confronts
him to,

102
00:06:40,280 --> 00:06:42,770
to symbolic,
opting out of responsibility,

103
00:06:42,771 --> 00:06:46,760
the pride lands have fallen into ruin
and all animals are suffering.

104
00:06:47,180 --> 00:06:50,090
Look,
sometimes bad things happens and there's

105
00:06:50,091 --> 00:06:53,330
nothing you can do about it.
So why worry?

106
00:06:53,390 --> 00:06:55,220
Because it's your responsibility.

107
00:06:56,240 --> 00:07:01,130
Tim Bias to tear himself away from the
escapists pleasures off his Hakuna

108
00:07:01,130 --> 00:07:04,880
Matata philosophy in order to take a
mature place in a world where he can be

109
00:07:04,881 --> 00:07:08,120
responsible for himself and others to do
this.

110
00:07:08,121 --> 00:07:11,030
However,
he must complete a difficult task or

111
00:07:11,031 --> 00:07:14,390
facing himself and his guilt of his
father's death.

112
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:17,360
You said you'd always be there for me.

113
00:07:19,020 --> 00:07:19,853
That's true or not.

114
00:07:23,040 --> 00:07:24,540
It's because of me.

115
00:07:26,030 --> 00:07:27,200
It's my fault.

116
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:29,633
It's life

117
00:07:31,150 --> 00:07:34,330
as client stays.
The oedipal struggle is to relinquish

118
00:07:34,331 --> 00:07:36,430
one's wish to take the fall dish
replace,

119
00:07:36,490 --> 00:07:40,900
but instead of taking one's own place in
the world while still adopting was good

120
00:07:40,901 --> 00:07:44,230
in a father too.
Happy to be both like him and different

121
00:07:44,231 --> 00:07:47,560
than him instead of needing to be in in
the lion king.

122
00:07:47,590 --> 00:07:50,470
This is symbolized beautifully by
visualizing symbols,

123
00:07:50,471 --> 00:07:54,610
internal struggle through him finding
his rate through tick tones and then

124
00:07:54,611 --> 00:07:58,060
seeing himself and his father in his
reflection in the water

125
00:08:01,650 --> 00:08:05,300
you see
he needs.

126
00:08:09,240 --> 00:08:12,210
I think this is the key moment of Simba
story,

127
00:08:12,360 --> 00:08:17,070
the painful journey or facing himself
and his guilt about his father is what

128
00:08:17,071 --> 00:08:21,630
enables Simba to transcend this
adolescence and become a man or in this

129
00:08:21,631 --> 00:08:26,400
case lion in his own rights.
Simba understands that he is not as far

130
00:08:26,401 --> 00:08:31,040
though that he can find his father
within him only by internalizing Mufasa

131
00:08:31,140 --> 00:08:33,390
and the qualities here,
narratives from him,

132
00:08:33,391 --> 00:08:38,391
Simba can adopt responsibility for
others and face scar in order to restore

133
00:08:38,401 --> 00:08:42,630
the pride lands to balance.
And the end to center architect Malesan

134
00:08:42,631 --> 00:08:46,470
lesson off the lion king is that in
order to grow up we must adopt

135
00:08:46,471 --> 00:08:51,450
responsibility of ourselves and others.
If we choose to escape its pleasures and

136
00:08:51,451 --> 00:08:55,230
renounce our healthy aggression,
our competitiveness and ambition,

137
00:08:55,260 --> 00:08:58,310
we've become unable to engage
productively in the world.

138
00:08:58,680 --> 00:09:02,370
To remember that who we are is to
remember where we can be.

139
00:09:02,630 --> 00:09:07,630
It is to adopt the responsibility or
realizing our full potential and to try

140
00:09:07,771 --> 00:09:12,771
to make our world a better place.
All right.

141
00:09:42,050 --> 00:09:45,560
Thank you everyone for watching.
It's been a while but it's good to be

142
00:09:45,561 --> 00:09:47,270
back.
If should like our work,

143
00:09:47,271 --> 00:09:51,260
consider supporting us on Patrion.
We offer some awesome rewards and it

144
00:09:51,261 --> 00:09:55,160
helps us sustain his channel.
Also a big thank you to the following

145
00:09:55,190 --> 00:09:56,530
top patrons.
Uh,

146
00:09:56,600 --> 00:09:59,360
your help is really appreciate it and
thank you to everyone.

147
00:09:59,390 --> 00:10:00,980
We will see you for the next video.
