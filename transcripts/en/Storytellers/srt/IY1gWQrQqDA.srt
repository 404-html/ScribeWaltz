1
00:00:02,790 --> 00:00:06,120
The renowned writer and historian
William do ran,

2
00:00:06,180 --> 00:00:10,110
one stated that quote,
a great civilization is not conquered

3
00:00:10,111 --> 00:00:14,130
from without and so it has destroyed
itself from within.

4
00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:23,430
Now,
those of you who've seen apocalypto may

5
00:00:23,431 --> 00:00:28,390
remember that the movie opens with this
exact quote and it also really shooting

6
00:00:28,440 --> 00:00:32,040
come as much of a surprise that the
mixture of Mel Gibson with a movie that

7
00:00:32,041 --> 00:00:35,670
attempts to prove Duran statement
through to fictionalize decline of the

8
00:00:35,671 --> 00:00:38,730
Mayan civilization,
was it the cause of some outbursts from

9
00:00:38,820 --> 00:00:42,240
numerous scholars?
Stephen Ben's from the University of

10
00:00:42,240 --> 00:00:44,960
Nebraska writes that quote legally
Gibson the madman.

11
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,670
We'd give him too much of a pass.
It will be to ignore us.

12
00:00:47,671 --> 00:00:50,160
Unfortunately,
skilled participation in Hollywood

13
00:00:50,161 --> 00:00:53,820
cinema as long history as a tool for
discrimination and oppression,

14
00:00:54,210 --> 00:00:57,840
but most importantly a large chunk of
these critiques seem to culminate in a

15
00:00:57,841 --> 00:01:02,400
climax of the movie with the coming of
the capital expanders and since the city

16
00:01:02,401 --> 00:01:07,401
mayans are depicted as rotten and cruel
tracy and interprets this event as an

17
00:01:07,590 --> 00:01:11,460
offensive and racist notion that my
people were brutal to one another long

18
00:01:11,461 --> 00:01:14,910
before the arrival of Europeans and us.
They deserve that effect.

19
00:01:14,911 --> 00:01:17,730
They needed rescue.
To be honest,

20
00:01:17,820 --> 00:01:20,850
I had a hard time trying to find a
single academic article that wasn't an

21
00:01:20,851 --> 00:01:24,380
overly negative about this movie,
so I figured it was about time for

22
00:01:24,381 --> 00:01:28,550
someone to change that and to do so,
we need to start our analysis here.

23
00:01:33,440 --> 00:01:36,020
It's a or Honda.
Immediately introduce the audience to

24
00:01:36,021 --> 00:01:38,870
the first of the film's main themes and
values,

25
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:41,360
which is the hunter versus hunted
relationship.

26
00:01:41,880 --> 00:01:44,000
Now,
there is a reason why this is important,

27
00:01:44,001 --> 00:01:47,180
but I'll get back to that later.
The second theme reveals itself as

28
00:01:47,190 --> 00:01:50,840
Jaeger par cuts of specific parts of the
animal and gifts them to his fellow

29
00:01:50,841 --> 00:01:52,670
hunters.
Shortly thereafter,

30
00:01:52,671 --> 00:01:54,560
they treat a part of the taper for some
fish.

31
00:01:54,561 --> 00:01:57,290
God,
by now to try passing by giving and

32
00:01:57,291 --> 00:02:00,170
sharing are shown to be integral parts
of the community's culture.

33
00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:03,380
There existed conscious respect and
gratitude for the abundance of the

34
00:02:03,381 --> 00:02:05,380
forest.
We just show them both non verbally,

35
00:02:05,490 --> 00:02:08,560
not making use of literally every part
of the team.

36
00:02:10,710 --> 00:02:14,760
Hello darkness,
my old friend and verbally.

37
00:02:15,110 --> 00:02:19,560
My little later during the nighttime
Fiesta village elder tells the story of

38
00:02:19,561 --> 00:02:22,230
the sad man who sat in the scrutiny,
never be quelled,

39
00:02:22,410 --> 00:02:23,940
however much the world would give him.

40
00:02:24,300 --> 00:02:29,300
Yeah know being at
a new gate,

41
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:33,620
take a book.

42
00:02:35,350 --> 00:02:38,710
The theme of abundance has also extended
your parents respect for fertility.

43
00:02:38,711 --> 00:02:42,010
Present in the community.
Flint sky speaks of having produced 10

44
00:02:42,011 --> 00:02:43,750
children.
Do you ever pause his son?

45
00:02:43,780 --> 00:02:47,110
His wife is pregnant with her second and
the kids run a muck in the village.

46
00:02:47,470 --> 00:02:50,710
Blunted seems to be the odd one out as
he is unable to impregnate,

47
00:02:50,711 --> 00:02:53,110
his wife is due to dissatisfaction of
her mother,

48
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:57,160
the situation which Mel Gibson then of
course utilize us to depict some 16th

49
00:02:57,161 --> 00:03:02,140
century pranking
to register our next two themes,

50
00:03:02,170 --> 00:03:03,470
family,
enjoy,

51
00:03:03,490 --> 00:03:07,060
or a piece with no real hierarchy or
class system present.

52
00:03:07,061 --> 00:03:09,190
The community seems to function as a
sort of big,

53
00:03:09,191 --> 00:03:10,720
happy family.
In fact,

54
00:03:10,721 --> 00:03:14,290
the first act of buck lipstick could
almost just as well be mistaken for a

55
00:03:14,291 --> 00:03:17,140
feel good comedy about jolly mind's
kicking it into jungle.

56
00:03:31,850 --> 00:03:33,800
However,
if things aren't all Hunky Dory,

57
00:03:33,801 --> 00:03:36,460
as is evidenced in introduction of the
first opposite thing,

58
00:03:37,010 --> 00:03:39,520
which is fear,
Jaeger pause,

59
00:03:39,560 --> 00:03:40,131
brewery,
Budda,

60
00:03:40,131 --> 00:03:43,400
encounter with the audit tripe,
they seem scared and running away from

61
00:03:43,401 --> 00:03:47,420
something his father Flynn's skies
subsequently explains to him that fear

62
00:03:47,421 --> 00:03:52,421
is a sickness.
Unfortunately Jaguar pause,

63
00:03:53,650 --> 00:03:56,170
fear soon,
become very real as the city minds

64
00:03:56,171 --> 00:04:00,160
approach the village and in contrast to
the jelly looking hunter and gatherers,

65
00:04:00,190 --> 00:04:02,930
these mayans live grinman angry their
leaders.

66
00:04:02,970 --> 00:04:07,810
Zero Wolf is seeing using human skulls
as part of his warriors outfit as sound

67
00:04:07,811 --> 00:04:11,200
draws them near to the camp.
He orders them to split up and sneakily

68
00:04:11,230 --> 00:04:14,230
make their way inside.
It is here that it becomes obvious that

69
00:04:14,231 --> 00:04:16,600
these mines are on our hunts,
but instead of tape here,

70
00:04:16,900 --> 00:04:21,900
fellow humans are to be their prey.
Firas spread like wildfire throughout

71
00:04:22,331 --> 00:04:24,230
the villages.
Zero volts crew capture,

72
00:04:24,231 --> 00:04:25,990
kill and rape their way for you to camp.

73
00:04:26,440 --> 00:04:29,680
And as they make their way out,
the surviving children are left behind.

74
00:04:30,250 --> 00:04:34,540
So at the beginning of the second act,
the themes of family love and fertility

75
00:04:34,541 --> 00:04:38,350
are replaced by repressive authority and
hateful moral indecency.

76
00:04:38,760 --> 00:04:42,340
And as soon made clear to violence and
pain are the determining factors of

77
00:04:42,341 --> 00:04:45,100
strength in the community of the city,
Mayan Warriors,

78
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:52,600
the extend of the various contrasts
between your protagonists world and the

79
00:04:52,601 --> 00:04:54,810
world of his captors becomes especially
apparent.

80
00:04:54,820 --> 00:04:57,160
District group moves into dare part of
the jungle,

81
00:04:57,450 --> 00:04:59,440
or rather what was one part of the
jungle,

82
00:04:59,870 --> 00:05:03,290
the abundance fertility in all run
feeling of lightness of the jungle

83
00:05:03,291 --> 00:05:07,040
village or a police by scarcity in
fertility and death.

84
00:05:07,160 --> 00:05:10,880
One of the films most vital and powerful
scenes as the encounter with the girl.

85
00:05:10,910 --> 00:05:14,420
The warriors have obviously given up any
hope of helping dose contaminated,

86
00:05:14,421 --> 00:05:17,930
but what seems to be the plague as they
pushed the desperate little girl away,

87
00:05:17,960 --> 00:05:20,450
she didn't seem to become possessed by
some higher power,

88
00:05:20,510 --> 00:05:23,960
which then prophesizes the coming of the
Spaniards and the end of the Mayan

89
00:05:23,961 --> 00:05:24,794
civilization.

90
00:05:27,920 --> 00:05:28,753
Yes.

91
00:05:33,830 --> 00:05:36,830
According to William Doran,
the sign of a civilization is the client

92
00:05:36,831 --> 00:05:40,100
expresses itself and moral.
The gay that's a group enters the city.

93
00:05:40,101 --> 00:05:43,610
It has shown that the sense of community
and family has been replaced here by a

94
00:05:43,611 --> 00:05:46,670
lack of care for the weekend to old and
slavery,

95
00:05:46,671 --> 00:05:49,310
theft,
and of course the dehumanization of the

96
00:05:49,311 --> 00:05:52,310
human body depicted in the sacrifices to
the gods.

97
00:05:52,460 --> 00:05:54,800
Again,
fear and violent at 40 are shown to be

98
00:05:54,801 --> 00:05:57,590
the determining factors of the society.
On of that,

99
00:05:57,591 --> 00:06:00,560
their leaders are conscious of this and
the abuser through dare advantage to

100
00:06:00,561 --> 00:06:04,340
rule and some theater people as is
evidenced by the preexisting knowledge

101
00:06:04,341 --> 00:06:09,341
of the coming solar eclipse,
so it makes the scape the board has set

102
00:06:09,650 --> 00:06:13,510
and the stakes are clear besides being a
personal struggle of life and death both

103
00:06:13,511 --> 00:06:17,960
for January as well as his trapped wife
and son to chase metaphorically also

104
00:06:17,961 --> 00:06:21,860
signifies a struggle between the before
mentioned opposite themes and values.

105
00:06:22,220 --> 00:06:25,070
Love versus hey,
abundance versus scarcity,

106
00:06:25,290 --> 00:06:28,550
freedom versus captivity,
authority 40 versus family,

107
00:06:28,760 --> 00:06:32,810
the hunter versus hunted and of course
courage versus fear,

108
00:06:33,020 --> 00:06:36,320
and it is exactly in this last aspect in
which Jaeger par is lacking.

109
00:06:36,530 --> 00:06:39,740
After taking a leap of faith,
he finally realized this and the science

110
00:06:39,760 --> 00:06:43,580
let go of his fear depicted in a scene
in which he metaphorically embodies the

111
00:06:43,581 --> 00:06:46,670
symbolism of the Jaguar,
which to some stands for the power to

112
00:06:46,671 --> 00:06:49,130
face one's fierce in front one's
enemies.

113
00:06:49,580 --> 00:06:52,340
It's at that point it stops being the
hunted and retakes,

114
00:06:52,370 --> 00:06:55,160
the role of the hunter thank wishing his
adversaries,

115
00:06:55,161 --> 00:07:00,161
one by one
users took a hell of a hit and most

116
00:07:10,661 --> 00:07:13,990
obvious sign of this change in roles of
course has shown fruit to death with

117
00:07:13,991 --> 00:07:16,180
zero wolf by use of the TPO track.

118
00:07:18,520 --> 00:07:19,750
Jennifer

119
00:07:20,340 --> 00:07:23,980
fraud doesn't retake this role for a
long as a chase ends on the beach and

120
00:07:23,981 --> 00:07:28,540
we're back at that controversial climax
and we finally meet the ultimate hunters

121
00:07:28,580 --> 00:07:31,390
or to become the bringers of unspeakable
amounts of death.

122
00:07:31,420 --> 00:07:32,800
Of course,
as you might've noticed,

123
00:07:32,801 --> 00:07:34,930
I don't much agree on a degree of
controversy.

124
00:07:34,940 --> 00:07:38,410
Apply to Apocalypto as a whole,
as I believe that I've shown a story to

125
00:07:38,411 --> 00:07:42,370
me is not at all about justifying or
sweet talking European colonialism in

126
00:07:42,371 --> 00:07:45,130
the Americas,
but rather about more universal themes

127
00:07:45,131 --> 00:07:49,180
and real life cultural tendencies.
Mel Gibson as you several aspects of the

128
00:07:49,181 --> 00:07:53,020
Mayan civilization to depict the sort of
a historical summary of its people's

129
00:07:53,021 --> 00:07:55,930
rise and fall,
you can even argue that the movie really

130
00:07:55,931 --> 00:07:59,830
isn't all that much about the Mayans at
all as it Gibson himself as stated that

131
00:07:59,831 --> 00:08:03,910
he sees that Buck Lipo is more of an
allegory for modern day America with

132
00:08:03,911 --> 00:08:06,850
many of the same struggles playing a
role in today's society.

133
00:08:07,060 --> 00:08:10,210
I would go as far as stating that
apocalypto stories even more universal

134
00:08:10,211 --> 00:08:13,810
than that and can be seen as a general
visualization of William Durant's

135
00:08:13,811 --> 00:08:15,160
opening.
Quote Duran,

136
00:08:15,161 --> 00:08:16,810
of course,
was speaking of the fall of the Roman

137
00:08:16,811 --> 00:08:19,630
civilization,
but Gibson being Gibson left some direct

138
00:08:19,631 --> 00:08:23,350
references to that sign within the story
of Jaguar as well as another character

139
00:08:23,351 --> 00:08:25,960
or shown seven wounded in the right side
of the abdomen.

140
00:08:26,290 --> 00:08:29,200
This combined with the fact that the
group is being marched off to be

141
00:08:29,201 --> 00:08:32,260
sacrificed and mistakenly brings to
memory one of Gibson's other

142
00:08:32,261 --> 00:08:33,094
protagonists

143
00:08:36,420 --> 00:08:38,310
and right before this is all about to go
down.

144
00:08:38,311 --> 00:08:42,150
Blumkin's mother in law has a brief
Maria moment straight out of the passion

145
00:08:42,151 --> 00:08:43,770
of the Christ.
So in the end,

146
00:08:43,771 --> 00:08:46,020
I believe there's far more substance to
apocalypse,

147
00:08:46,021 --> 00:08:49,530
so dan just a chase scene and a quote
unquote racist message.

148
00:08:49,890 --> 00:08:52,950
It's an action movie of Great
Cinematography and one of the best chase

149
00:08:52,951 --> 00:08:55,680
sequences in Hollywood cinema's history
most,

150
00:08:55,890 --> 00:08:58,530
but in its score,
it remains deeply relevant story about a

151
00:08:58,531 --> 00:09:03,240
universal moral struggle in the cycle of
rise and fall and hunter and hunted,

152
00:09:03,690 --> 00:09:05,180
and although the movie of course the
pics,

153
00:09:05,181 --> 00:09:08,760
the apocalypse or the beginning of the
end for the Mayan civilization,

154
00:09:08,820 --> 00:09:11,130
it also,
and perhaps more importantly,

155
00:09:11,131 --> 00:09:14,340
leaves us with a message of hope to
stick to our morals,

156
00:09:14,370 --> 00:09:18,900
to face the future and to have the
courage to start it all over.

157
00:09:35,700 --> 00:09:38,610
All right guys.
That's the end of our analysis for

158
00:09:38,611 --> 00:09:41,060
apocalypto.
I hope you enjoyed a.

159
00:09:41,070 --> 00:09:43,800
had a bit of a hard time tackling this
video because there are basically you

160
00:09:43,801 --> 00:09:46,260
were in any articles that agree with my
view of the movie.

161
00:09:46,650 --> 00:09:47,930
Anyways.
