1
00:00:04,420 --> 00:00:08,500
It was shortly after meeting drones,
tracter Fitch that I realized that

2
00:00:08,501 --> 00:00:11,860
joining the Marine Corps might've been a
bad decision.

3
00:00:12,470 --> 00:00:14,290
All right,
come from brains.

4
00:00:14,740 --> 00:00:17,350
Show me exactly where your stubies I'm
running.

5
00:00:17,690 --> 00:00:20,490
No,
I never boot camp instructors doing

6
00:00:20,491 --> 00:00:22,520
amount of tech.
What?

7
00:00:22,521 --> 00:00:26,620
I'm giving you a few love taps.
How the fuck are you going to fire your

8
00:00:26,630 --> 00:00:29,570
right bow when grenades are going up in
your face?

9
00:00:30,730 --> 00:00:33,540
What the fuck are you even doing here?
Sorry,

10
00:00:33,710 --> 00:00:37,840
I got lost on the [inaudible].
Okay.

11
00:00:47,290 --> 00:00:50,820
Now some of you might've noticed that
I've placed the original opening sound

12
00:00:50,821 --> 00:00:52,660
check of giants,
bobby mcferrin.

13
00:00:52,690 --> 00:00:54,750
Don't worry,
be happy with the opening sound.

14
00:00:54,751 --> 00:00:57,700
Check off the 90 86 film full metal
jackets.

15
00:00:57,850 --> 00:00:59,590
Now,
although I have copyright reasons for

16
00:00:59,591 --> 00:01:02,170
this,
I also think it's essential to analyze

17
00:01:02,200 --> 00:01:06,490
jarhead within the context of full metal
jacket because of its similarities,

18
00:01:06,491 --> 00:01:08,800
birth even more because of its
differences.

19
00:01:11,820 --> 00:01:13,980
Now,
jars refuse upon release were quite

20
00:01:13,981 --> 00:01:17,890
mixed and many were even negative.
Leslie Valparin described jarred as

21
00:01:17,900 --> 00:01:20,490
critical as claimed that it has little
new to say,

22
00:01:20,940 --> 00:01:23,610
and Joshua Moon stated that the film
goes nowhere,

23
00:01:24,290 --> 00:01:27,030
but two major paradoxical criticism
stood out.

24
00:01:27,450 --> 00:01:31,890
Joe teachy claimed that barely a frame
wheel feel to remind it's audience off

25
00:01:31,891 --> 00:01:35,580
another seminar war movie.
It's effectively the Iraq of date.

26
00:01:35,581 --> 00:01:36,660
Oh,
full metal jacket.

27
00:01:36,690 --> 00:01:37,471
Yes.
All this claim,

28
00:01:37,471 --> 00:01:40,830
the film fell out of genre as a warm
movie since there were no battles being

29
00:01:40,831 --> 00:01:42,210
fought.
Yes,

30
00:01:42,211 --> 00:01:46,230
I was argued that in this paradox of
both relying on other warfiles while

31
00:01:46,260 --> 00:01:48,940
also not adhering to the Warfield Sharma
lays,

32
00:01:48,941 --> 00:01:50,940
jr has cental team.
Now,

33
00:01:50,941 --> 00:01:54,630
both films start out with a brutal
bootcamp off the United States Marine

34
00:01:54,631 --> 00:01:57,180
Corps.
The recruits are broken down into films,

35
00:01:57,181 --> 00:01:58,490
both through verbal sauce

36
00:01:58,590 --> 00:02:01,090
or you have a girlfriend.
Swapper sorry,

37
00:02:01,091 --> 00:02:02,980
I started this again,
mother fucker.

38
00:02:02,981 --> 00:02:07,060
Jody's banging her right now.
Get on your face and give me 25 per

39
00:02:07,061 --> 00:02:10,660
every time she gets fucked.
This month down on your face

40
00:02:10,870 --> 00:02:12,250
and through physical training.

41
00:02:16,410 --> 00:02:17,280
Oh,
that's right.

42
00:02:17,320 --> 00:02:20,480
Private mile.
Don't make any fucking up to get up to

43
00:02:20,481 --> 00:02:23,980
the top of the fucking cops to go.
God want to do up there.

44
00:02:23,981 --> 00:02:26,290
He went up very cold.
Your ass up there by now.

45
00:02:26,291 --> 00:02:29,200
One night.
Get your bags up there.

46
00:02:29,220 --> 00:02:31,700
Pile.
The hell is the matter with your buddy.

47
00:02:31,701 --> 00:02:33,910
What?
I bet you if there was some punchy up

48
00:02:33,911 --> 00:02:36,460
there on top of that off,
you can get up there,

49
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:37,900
Joe.
Yeah.

50
00:02:38,330 --> 00:02:42,080
John resembles this process closely to
watch what is shown in full metal jacket

51
00:02:42,500 --> 00:02:45,860
from the verbal assault and equal
woodless nurse without racism.

52
00:02:45,861 --> 00:02:46,694
Speech.

53
00:02:47,100 --> 00:02:48,860
No ratio.
Bigger three here.

54
00:02:49,100 --> 00:02:52,100
I do not look down on niggers cuts.
What?

55
00:02:52,150 --> 00:02:53,590
They're grazer.
Hey,

56
00:02:53,640 --> 00:02:58,640
are you all all equally worthless?
You are no longer black or brown or

57
00:02:59,020 --> 00:03:02,260
yellow or red.
You are now,

58
00:03:03,460 --> 00:03:08,460
you are like food or dark boon.
Do you understand

59
00:03:10,490 --> 00:03:11,400
any car?

60
00:03:11,590 --> 00:03:15,990
Two to the glorification of marine
marksman ship and reshaping of marines

61
00:03:15,991 --> 00:03:17,370
into coal hearts killers.

62
00:03:17,700 --> 00:03:22,700
The Marine Corps does not want robots.
The Marine Corps wants killers.

63
00:03:24,390 --> 00:03:27,510
The Marine Corps wants to build
indestructable men.

64
00:03:27,970 --> 00:03:29,360
We're going to kick a rock.
Yes.

65
00:03:29,530 --> 00:03:32,320
Oh hell son.
What are you going to win the medal of

66
00:03:32,321 --> 00:03:35,380
honor all by yourself?
What's the rest of my battalion going to

67
00:03:35,381 --> 00:03:36,214
do?
Jake?

68
00:03:36,330 --> 00:03:37,650
Yes,
you know,

69
00:03:37,660 --> 00:03:41,650
I think it's time for me to retire.
I can't hear how fucking day

70
00:03:44,950 --> 00:03:46,260
I just got off.
Hard off.

71
00:03:55,650 --> 00:03:57,930
Yes,
it is in the second part by jar has

72
00:03:57,931 --> 00:04:00,450
quickly starts to differ from
expectations.

73
00:04:00,660 --> 00:04:04,650
Jarheads shows us the marines in the
deserts aware that there a war going on

74
00:04:04,690 --> 00:04:06,390
that's enabled to participate.

75
00:04:08,690 --> 00:04:09,490
Yeah.

76
00:04:09,490 --> 00:04:13,210
Suggested techniques for the marine to
use and the avoidance of boredom and

77
00:04:13,211 --> 00:04:16,210
loneliness.
Masturbation,

78
00:04:17,860 --> 00:04:20,740
rereading of letters from unfaithful
wives and girlfriends,

79
00:04:22,780 --> 00:04:26,440
cleaning your rifle,
further masturbation.

80
00:04:28,170 --> 00:04:31,520
It is here where the central team of
chartered slowly becomes apparent.

81
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:34,600
Our full metal jacket is critical of the
Marine corpse and the war.

82
00:04:34,630 --> 00:04:38,950
The marines went a full combat in
Vietnam are functioning even when chaos,

83
00:04:38,951 --> 00:04:42,580
psoriasis in the heat of battle,
they prevail and return back to order.

84
00:04:43,540 --> 00:04:45,850
However,
in jarhead the second part of the movie

85
00:04:45,851 --> 00:04:50,200
is a long and grueling process of
waiting boredom and living in the desert

86
00:04:50,230 --> 00:04:53,290
without any contact with outside world
back home.

87
00:04:53,291 --> 00:04:56,110
Life goes on and their relationships
fall apart.

88
00:05:02,740 --> 00:05:05,920
She up there yet.
Don't worry,

89
00:05:05,921 --> 00:05:07,260
she will.
She'll be right there.

90
00:05:07,510 --> 00:05:09,600
She's going to look beautiful up there.

91
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:15,150
The Marines aimlessly patrolled the
deserts in harbor oilfields get bombed

92
00:05:15,151 --> 00:05:18,840
by mortars but never see the enemy.
It is here that the film breaks with

93
00:05:18,841 --> 00:05:20,970
hands.
Robert Jars calls to your rising of

94
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:24,150
expectations,
but the viewer's expectations of a war

95
00:05:24,151 --> 00:05:28,410
film and the Marines expectations off
the work at Cheddar before the marines

96
00:05:28,411 --> 00:05:30,450
leave.
The film shows them getting riled up

97
00:05:30,451 --> 00:05:33,870
with the perspective of to grow his ride
of the valkyries scene in apocalypse

98
00:05:33,871 --> 00:05:36,240
now,
shaping their few or fought a war will

99
00:05:36,241 --> 00:05:37,074
be like

100
00:06:01,990 --> 00:06:06,990
all personnel are to report immediately
to your company or

101
00:06:09,480 --> 00:06:10,313
yes,

102
00:06:13,710 --> 00:06:15,910
you to spend this juxtaposition to film
state.

103
00:06:15,911 --> 00:06:19,650
Something about a different sort of wars
and the experiences of the marines in

104
00:06:19,651 --> 00:06:20,900
these wars.
That's one of them.

105
00:06:20,901 --> 00:06:22,980
Reads,
realizes how different this blog will

106
00:06:22,981 --> 00:06:23,970
be.
He Commons.

107
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:25,880
Look around.
You hear those fights.

108
00:06:26,300 --> 00:06:28,190
This board's going to move too fast for
us.

109
00:06:28,570 --> 00:06:31,340
All right,
we can shoot a thousand yards to go that

110
00:06:31,341 --> 00:06:35,360
far and Vietnam and take a week or one a
year here.

111
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:39,620
Can I take about 10 fucking seconds?
By the time we have our rifles style,

112
00:06:39,650 --> 00:06:41,360
the war is going to be a mile down the
road

113
00:06:43,040 --> 00:06:43,873
wake up.

114
00:06:44,650 --> 00:06:47,650
But besides the new technological
reality of the war,

115
00:06:47,710 --> 00:06:51,790
the more important statement to feel
makes is on the psychological impact of

116
00:06:51,791 --> 00:06:55,630
being in the war or in this case not
being in the war in a sense,

117
00:06:55,631 --> 00:06:59,650
being broken down and then rebuild as
supposed Koolhaas killing marines in the

118
00:06:59,651 --> 00:07:03,940
Marine Corp bootcamp booth enabled to
apply this mindset and acquired skills

119
00:07:03,941 --> 00:07:07,000
leads to just as much of a mental
breakdown as the horror.

120
00:07:07,001 --> 00:07:10,450
So full combat.
The film shows us the slow descent of

121
00:07:10,451 --> 00:07:12,700
the marines into these mental breakdowns
with,

122
00:07:12,701 --> 00:07:13,540
of course,
Jake,

123
00:07:13,540 --> 00:07:15,400
Jen,
last character Swafford at the center,

124
00:07:15,670 --> 00:07:19,510
multiple moments than out one of the
marines breaks down when he finds out

125
00:07:19,511 --> 00:07:20,890
his wife is cheating on him.

126
00:07:31,210 --> 00:07:32,043
Sorry.

127
00:07:32,190 --> 00:07:34,080
When a fellow marine gets him into
trouble,

128
00:07:34,200 --> 00:07:35,970
swafford breaks down completely

129
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:37,960
the fuck up.
Shut the fuck up.

130
00:07:38,710 --> 00:07:40,540
Shut the fuck out.
My repeat after me.

131
00:07:41,870 --> 00:07:44,680
This is my rifle.
There are many like it without me.

132
00:07:44,681 --> 00:07:49,040
My rifle
went down,

133
00:07:49,420 --> 00:07:50,253
my rifle,
I

134
00:07:53,890 --> 00:07:55,000
shut the fuck up.
Shut the fuck.

135
00:07:57,670 --> 00:07:59,690
Fuck you.
Show me.

136
00:08:08,550 --> 00:08:09,383
No.

137
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:12,113
Wow.

138
00:08:15,630 --> 00:08:18,090
And finally,
what Swafford gets a chance to shoot at

139
00:08:18,091 --> 00:08:20,580
an enemy.
The opportunity is taken away at the

140
00:08:20,581 --> 00:08:21,414
last moment.

141
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:26,840
This is all for fun anyway.
Well,

142
00:08:26,870 --> 00:08:27,750
wait,
not alive.

143
00:08:28,430 --> 00:08:30,890
What difference does it make you come
back to him?

144
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:38,000
Because we got the Goddamn shut.
Your fucking desk jockey and the fucking

145
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:54,600
bracket or
nope.

146
00:09:12,030 --> 00:09:15,990
The film shows us how to offer
experiences of this bar are completely

147
00:09:15,991 --> 00:09:19,020
different than from other wars you have.
Not less awful.

148
00:09:19,290 --> 00:09:23,370
It is this message that reconciles the
paradox of being a different war film

149
00:09:23,430 --> 00:09:26,310
and also leaning on its predecessors is
paradox,

150
00:09:26,311 --> 00:09:29,820
becomes the central team and is summed
up in the film in one sentence.

151
00:09:30,390 --> 00:09:31,500
Every worse,
different.

152
00:09:37,070 --> 00:09:42,070
Every war is the same
kettle drum

153
00:09:46,210 --> 00:09:51,210
swallow to boots.
Dale

154
00:09:53,450 --> 00:09:54,283
shoes.

155
00:09:57,860 --> 00:10:01,580
Thank you all so much for watching.
So we had a bit of a break since

156
00:10:01,581 --> 00:10:05,030
university began.
Birthday will be new videos in the

157
00:10:05,030 --> 00:10:06,630
coming weeks.
We also started a patron.

158
00:10:06,650 --> 00:10:08,090
A,
we're still very small,

159
00:10:08,091 --> 00:10:10,640
but every little bit helps us to make
better videos.

160
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,200
Uh,
but more importantly,

161
00:10:12,201 --> 00:10:15,590
we wanted to start giving additional
content from those that are interested

162
00:10:15,591 --> 00:10:17,030
in it.
So for example,

163
00:10:17,031 --> 00:10:20,180
if you support us with $1,
you get a video preview of the next

164
00:10:20,181 --> 00:10:23,360
video before it comes out.
If you support us with $2,

165
00:10:23,390 --> 00:10:27,290
you get access to written essays with
additional thoughts and information.

166
00:10:27,320 --> 00:10:29,120
After each video,
$5,

167
00:10:29,121 --> 00:10:31,250
we will get you an exclusive video once
a month.

168
00:10:31,280 --> 00:10:32,010
Uh,
et Cetera,

169
00:10:32,010 --> 00:10:33,710
et cetera.
This was of course,

170
00:10:33,711 --> 00:10:36,920
completely optional.
Add a youtube sas will always be free.

171
00:10:36,921 --> 00:10:39,860
So no problem if you aren't interested
in any case,

172
00:10:39,861 --> 00:10:43,160
thank you for watching and we will see
you next week when the next video is

173
00:10:43,161 --> 00:10:43,670
released.
