1
00:00:05,480 --> 00:00:08,150
Mazes have fascinated us for tens of
thousands.

2
00:00:08,180 --> 00:00:13,180
So if years from ancient wall drawings
to Greek and Roman mythology to modern

3
00:00:13,921 --> 00:00:18,870
film mazes and labyrinths have on some
level always strongly resonated with the

4
00:00:18,871 --> 00:00:22,500
human experience and seeing at a
symbolical layered deeper than the

5
00:00:22,501 --> 00:00:25,980
merely physical experience you get from
exploring it's corridors,

6
00:00:26,280 --> 00:00:30,810
which is a reason why I got intrigued by
Denis Villeneuve's 2014 film prisoners

7
00:00:30,990 --> 00:00:33,840
and how it uses mazes as a symbol in
prisoners.

8
00:00:33,841 --> 00:00:36,360
We never get to see amaze in its
physical form.

9
00:00:36,450 --> 00:00:38,850
In fact,
the maize is not even billy explicitly

10
00:00:38,851 --> 00:00:41,220
mentioned at all until later in the
story.

11
00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:45,210
I look totally amazed that a map
guarding fundraisers remaining in the

12
00:00:45,211 --> 00:00:47,730
background for the better first half of
the film,

13
00:00:48,420 --> 00:00:49,520
yet it's significant.
Shoot,

14
00:00:49,521 --> 00:00:53,820
not be understated as the nice film of
himself seems to have somewhat of a mild

15
00:00:53,821 --> 00:00:56,880
obsession with these puzzles,
with characters having to venture

16
00:00:56,881 --> 00:00:59,400
through both physical and mental
corridors,

17
00:00:59,401 --> 00:01:02,430
trying not to lose themselves in search
of answers,

18
00:01:02,700 --> 00:01:06,150
answers about family,
about what's right and what's wrong

19
00:01:06,390 --> 00:01:07,920
about life,
death,

20
00:01:08,100 --> 00:01:12,390
what connects us through language and
about faith in the face of evil.

21
00:01:12,830 --> 00:01:14,940
If you'll notice,
puzzle is one that focuses on the

22
00:01:14,941 --> 00:01:18,000
metaphorical and the psychological
symbolism of the maze,

23
00:01:18,180 --> 00:01:21,510
rather than having it directly manifest
itself in its physical form.

24
00:01:21,720 --> 00:01:22,710
Now,
most western May,

25
00:01:22,711 --> 00:01:26,430
symbolism seems to be derived from the
Greek myth of theseus and the minutes

26
00:01:26,431 --> 00:01:30,750
are which sells historian easiest,
who needs to find and kill a monstrous

27
00:01:30,751 --> 00:01:34,470
beast at the center of the labyrinth
using a threat of hair from his lover

28
00:01:34,471 --> 00:01:36,390
area.
Ariadne needs to make sure he doesn't

29
00:01:36,391 --> 00:01:39,540
get lost along the way.
Now compare that to the story of

30
00:01:39,541 --> 00:01:41,880
prisoners,
which is about the kidnapping of two

31
00:01:41,881 --> 00:01:45,420
daughters and how the characters involve
choose to react in order to get them

32
00:01:45,421 --> 00:01:48,100
back.
The main focus here is placed on to

33
00:01:48,101 --> 00:01:51,070
character Keller Dover,
a religious and protective,

34
00:01:51,080 --> 00:01:55,300
that who will do anything to keep his
family safe and who will ultimately find

35
00:01:55,301 --> 00:01:59,680
the monster of his world with the help
of a young girl and Loki and ace

36
00:01:59,681 --> 00:02:02,950
detective with a troubled background,
tasks of the mission to solve the

37
00:02:02,951 --> 00:02:06,520
mystery and find a missing kids,
so only metaphorical level.

38
00:02:06,570 --> 00:02:10,770
The maze in prisoners then seems to
loosely echoed as age old Greek myth.

39
00:02:11,220 --> 00:02:15,420
Both these men set out on a search using
their own respective belief systems to

40
00:02:15,421 --> 00:02:18,780
lead them through the metaphorical maze
of mystery and morality,

41
00:02:19,230 --> 00:02:22,710
hoping to find the truth at the center
and to confront those responsible for

42
00:02:22,711 --> 00:02:25,220
the kidnapping.
It perhaps more strikingly similar

43
00:02:25,221 --> 00:02:28,670
connection can be found in Nordic
mythology involving a maiden horror

44
00:02:28,671 --> 00:02:30,680
princess stuck in the center of the
maze,

45
00:02:30,740 --> 00:02:32,090
again,
guarded by months,

46
00:02:32,290 --> 00:02:34,990
creature of source,
the late poet Robert Graves,

47
00:02:35,020 --> 00:02:38,650
argued that what these very stories have
in common is that they share a journey

48
00:02:38,651 --> 00:02:42,770
of the main character into Bofi physical
as well as a mental underworld.

49
00:02:43,270 --> 00:02:45,710
Keller nurturers daughter might be a
physical one,

50
00:02:45,711 --> 00:02:49,430
but as his faith is challenged and he's
forced to confront the darker and more

51
00:02:49,490 --> 00:02:52,730
violent parts of his nature,
his journey into the maze of the honor

52
00:02:52,731 --> 00:02:57,260
ruled increasingly becomes a mental one,
so much so that his goal to protect his

53
00:02:57,261 --> 00:03:01,600
family almost ends up destroying as he
neglects his traumatized wife and

54
00:03:01,601 --> 00:03:06,530
increasingly regresses back into old
destructive habits and places until he'd

55
00:03:06,540 --> 00:03:09,790
literally descends into his own darkest
place imaginable,

56
00:03:10,210 --> 00:03:12,460
helpless and unable to save his
daughter.

57
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:17,350
Low key on the other hand,
has to unravel the truth by descending

58
00:03:17,351 --> 00:03:21,250
into a more physical hell,
trying to find order and disorder and

59
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:23,770
literally facing off against the forces
of the devil

60
00:03:24,010 --> 00:03:26,950
making children disappears.
The war we wage

61
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:32,280
the maze here seems to be a symbol for
the chaos to Jones is set up under

62
00:03:32,310 --> 00:03:35,490
victims until they killed him off with
the venom of a snake,

63
00:03:35,730 --> 00:03:39,900
the disciples symbol for the devil and
the archetype of the maze and prisoners

64
00:03:39,901 --> 00:03:42,270
seems to stand for the opposite of
Paradise.

65
00:03:42,630 --> 00:03:45,180
We're in the words of playwright Eugene,
UNESCO.

66
00:03:45,630 --> 00:03:48,180
If goodness is order,
evil must be disordered,

67
00:03:48,370 --> 00:03:51,300
straight path or the maze and it's if
this insight,

68
00:03:51,301 --> 00:03:54,300
the Vilna of utilize this symbol to
explore it and morality in the

69
00:03:54,301 --> 00:03:58,760
psychological nature of his character's
Keller starts off as an open league

70
00:03:58,770 --> 00:04:02,850
devout Christian which has made quite
obvious through his usage of prayers

71
00:04:03,150 --> 00:04:07,530
will be done on earth,
be abundance of Christian symbolism

72
00:04:07,531 --> 00:04:10,920
surrounding him,
his metaphorically appropriate job as a

73
00:04:10,921 --> 00:04:13,800
carpenter and through to names of his
wife and mother.

74
00:04:14,610 --> 00:04:16,830
Moreover,
Keller was shown to have a proclivity

75
00:04:16,831 --> 00:04:21,180
for orderliness and preparedness.
Both traits that consciously define his

76
00:04:21,181 --> 00:04:22,410
character.
Hurry for the best,

77
00:04:22,411 --> 00:04:24,480
prepare for the worst.
However,

78
00:04:24,481 --> 00:04:28,320
as I've shown Keller's journey is one of
increasing amounts of disorder,

79
00:04:28,610 --> 00:04:32,460
Aquestt that shakes his faith to at
score as he sees himself for super form

80
00:04:32,461 --> 00:04:36,540
ever escalating brutalities on the
person he suspects holds the key to his

81
00:04:36,541 --> 00:04:37,240
daughter.
Well,

82
00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:38,340
he making me do this.

83
00:04:41,450 --> 00:04:44,780
It's only at the end of this journey
when he's in his darkest place that he

84
00:04:44,781 --> 00:04:47,840
finally surrenders and returns to his
faith in God.

85
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:51,433
Check mine.

86
00:04:52,290 --> 00:04:55,770
Detective Loki goes down eight decidedly
different bath of the maze.

87
00:04:56,010 --> 00:04:59,190
His faith is based in both the Christian
as well as the pagan.

88
00:04:59,640 --> 00:05:01,530
The eight point,
it starts at two on his neck,

89
00:05:01,531 --> 00:05:03,970
referring to such things as redemption.
Youmail.

90
00:05:04,040 --> 00:05:07,800
The strength and compassion is Mason
Ring representing the search for

91
00:05:07,801 --> 00:05:11,430
enlightenment and rationality,
aligning perfectly with his character

92
00:05:11,431 --> 00:05:13,740
and the posing to more emotionally based
Geller,

93
00:05:14,070 --> 00:05:16,410
his odd name and turn.
It comes from the Nordic God,

94
00:05:16,411 --> 00:05:19,620
Loki gunning,
trickster and occasional helper of other

95
00:05:19,621 --> 00:05:20,454
gods.

96
00:05:20,470 --> 00:05:23,200
And even though the ace tech,
the fish show nuts to be immune to

97
00:05:23,201 --> 00:05:25,750
frustration,
never truly breaks away from his

98
00:05:25,751 --> 00:05:26,584
beliefs,

99
00:05:26,630 --> 00:05:29,900
ultimately help them in finding the
missing children and solving the

100
00:05:29,901 --> 00:05:32,510
mystery.
So besides acting as a symbol for the

101
00:05:32,511 --> 00:05:35,050
physical and metaphorical journey and
judy underworld,

102
00:05:35,100 --> 00:05:38,060
the also comes to represent a
psychological struggle.

103
00:05:38,090 --> 00:05:41,450
And the human brain,
Stanley Kubrick show this in connection

104
00:05:41,451 --> 00:05:44,330
with the growing and sanity of Jack
Torrance in the shining.

105
00:05:44,540 --> 00:05:47,420
But it's also a symbolism.
It has ample historical grounding.

106
00:05:47,510 --> 00:05:51,560
Both Christian and pagan famous around
the world have used a symbol of a linear

107
00:05:51,561 --> 00:05:56,561
one way labyrinth as a meditative baff
way towards the center towards God self

108
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:00,770
and the tree of life.
Psychoanalysts,

109
00:06:00,771 --> 00:06:03,080
Carl Young,
recognized labyrinths and similar

110
00:06:03,081 --> 00:06:06,170
figures of centers,
sculpt Mandalis as a universally

111
00:06:06,171 --> 00:06:09,410
recurring archetype always standing for
transformation,

112
00:06:09,411 --> 00:06:11,870
wholeness,
and the totality of an individual's

113
00:06:11,871 --> 00:06:14,390
reality.
The symbols can appear on the most

114
00:06:14,391 --> 00:06:19,070
common of household objects and things
like below sweaters and picture frames

115
00:06:19,340 --> 00:06:22,670
which are also expressed through
religion suggest a Christian Cross and

116
00:06:22,671 --> 00:06:23,570
the tree of life.

117
00:06:24,050 --> 00:06:27,260
It wouldn't cross as I've shown his
already abundantly represented them

118
00:06:27,261 --> 00:06:29,330
prisoners,
but so was the tree of life.

119
00:06:29,690 --> 00:06:30,830
In fact,
feel no spares,

120
00:06:30,831 --> 00:06:33,110
no expense.
Focusing his lens on trees,

121
00:06:33,200 --> 00:06:36,940
making them part of the plot and having
his main character interact with its

122
00:06:36,950 --> 00:06:40,130
substance.
Trees undeniably take on an important

123
00:06:40,131 --> 00:06:44,210
role in the film and it's no coincidence
that they too are connected to demand a

124
00:06:44,211 --> 00:06:47,000
symbol and by extension the labyrinth
there.

125
00:06:47,001 --> 00:06:50,570
Physical form is also a direct metaphor
for the human nervous system and the

126
00:06:50,571 --> 00:06:53,130
psychological state of our characters
there.

127
00:06:53,150 --> 00:06:56,390
Bare and leafless branches aligning with
our mood and mental state,

128
00:06:56,630 --> 00:06:59,150
which brings us back to the maze used by
the Joneses.

129
00:06:59,210 --> 00:07:02,810
Now it's important to know that this
particular maize is not a simple linear

130
00:07:02,811 --> 00:07:04,910
one far from it.
There's a connection.

131
00:07:05,570 --> 00:07:06,590
Okay.
Connection is,

132
00:07:06,591 --> 00:07:10,970
it's the last amazing book.
There's no way out your core there.

133
00:07:10,970 --> 00:07:14,570
LSD influenced May's processes
specifically designed to mentally

134
00:07:14,571 --> 00:07:17,840
blocked our victims in their journey
towards self individualization.

135
00:07:18,320 --> 00:07:22,040
It's a form of mind control that can
help explain why Alex seems to be stuck

136
00:07:22,041 --> 00:07:24,440
in the mind of a 10 year old and why
Bobby Taylor,

137
00:07:24,470 --> 00:07:26,870
although physically free is still
obsessive.

138
00:07:26,871 --> 00:07:29,510
Lee trying to find a way out of his own
mental health,

139
00:07:29,690 --> 00:07:33,210
but the maize is not just a tool for the
Joneses to imprison children and learn

140
00:07:33,230 --> 00:07:35,390
their parents.
It also goes to show how some of the

141
00:07:35,391 --> 00:07:37,400
characters had been stuck in there all
along.

142
00:07:37,640 --> 00:07:41,390
It's revealed that gathers dad committed
suicide in his house when Keller himself

143
00:07:41,391 --> 00:07:44,410
was still a team.
The contrast between his study house and

144
00:07:44,411 --> 00:07:46,770
is the lap.
It's aided parental home and calories,

145
00:07:46,850 --> 00:07:50,120
unwillingness to renovate the place.
Like I keep telling your mother it's an

146
00:07:50,121 --> 00:07:53,540
old building will cost a fortune to fix
it up revealed to us that the death of

147
00:07:53,541 --> 00:07:56,090
his father has still not been resolved
in his mind.

148
00:07:56,540 --> 00:08:00,650
Keller self grove as a teen has been
stunted by this drama and in a way he is

149
00:08:00,651 --> 00:08:05,180
as much a prisoner as Alex Jones and
Bobby Taylor has repressed feelings of

150
00:08:05,181 --> 00:08:07,820
rage and despair,
awakened by the kidnapping of his

151
00:08:07,821 --> 00:08:10,430
daughter.
Even killer's name meaning basement in

152
00:08:10,431 --> 00:08:12,940
German,
speaks to his character is hidden away

153
00:08:12,950 --> 00:08:15,950
mental trauma and foreshadows his
destiny perfectly.

154
00:08:16,700 --> 00:08:20,270
Holly Jones on herter and has been a
prisoner of our own respect of maize for

155
00:08:20,271 --> 00:08:24,200
quite some time after their son died of
cancer to one's devout Christians,

156
00:08:24,201 --> 00:08:28,010
lost our faith and decided to best to
drag as many people into their mental

157
00:08:28,011 --> 00:08:30,590
health was possible.
Even detective Loki seems to have

158
00:08:30,591 --> 00:08:33,050
struggled with his own maze during his
troubled childhood.

159
00:08:33,340 --> 00:08:34,910
You know what?
I spent six years old and having two

160
00:08:34,911 --> 00:08:39,800
boys home and you know the Hunnington
boys hurting a fuck like you'd be a real

161
00:08:39,801 --> 00:08:40,340
treat for me.

162
00:08:40,340 --> 00:08:41,930
What you telling me the difference of
yours?

163
00:08:41,931 --> 00:08:45,230
That Loki is the only one of these
characters who like in the story of

164
00:08:45,231 --> 00:08:49,850
Andrea [inaudible] is elevated himself
from the mental trap raising his

165
00:08:49,851 --> 00:08:53,540
consciousness in the process.
It's only fitting that he grows up to be

166
00:08:53,541 --> 00:08:57,240
an ace detective tasked with and guiding
others out of the maze.

167
00:08:57,660 --> 00:09:00,240
If the Jones is our disturbance of the
devil and trauma,

168
00:09:00,300 --> 00:09:02,760
Loki is to serve one of God and
enlightenment.

169
00:09:03,330 --> 00:09:06,600
The maze is an incredibly relevant
archetypal symbol of the human

170
00:09:06,601 --> 00:09:09,540
experience.
It has been for thousands of years and

171
00:09:09,541 --> 00:09:12,990
it continues to do so in our world and
in films like prisoners,

172
00:09:13,500 --> 00:09:15,900
the needs of El Nerf and writer Aaron
goosy Koski.

173
00:09:15,901 --> 00:09:19,380
You have shown that through adequate,
perhaps at times instinctive knowledge

174
00:09:19,381 --> 00:09:23,400
of his symbol it film can take on
equality to test the ability to make us

175
00:09:23,401 --> 00:09:27,090
wonder about it long after the credits
roll and not just because the symbol

176
00:09:27,091 --> 00:09:29,940
fits well with its story,
but more importantly because it

177
00:09:29,941 --> 00:09:33,930
expresses a truth about the human
experience that universally resonates of

178
00:09:33,931 --> 00:09:37,770
us as human beings and our endless
struggle and journey towards a higher

179
00:09:37,771 --> 00:09:39,840
self.
In the words of the late union

180
00:09:39,841 --> 00:09:43,590
psychoanalysts Edward See Whitman,
one of the oldest images of the mystery

181
00:09:43,591 --> 00:09:44,670
of life,
death,

182
00:09:44,671 --> 00:09:48,450
transformation and return is the
labyrinth that depicts the way to be

183
00:09:48,451 --> 00:09:49,320
unknown.
Center,

184
00:09:49,410 --> 00:09:52,440
the mystery of death and rebirth,
your risk of the search,

185
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:56,970
the danger of losing the way the quests
and the finding and the ability to

186
00:09:56,971 --> 00:09:57,804
return.

187
00:10:07,490 --> 00:10:09,620
