link in the description below

3
00:00:14,420 --> 00:00:17,960
in the short video essay.
I want to explore a contradiction I

4
00:00:17,961 --> 00:00:22,070
noticed when we watching two excellent
film centered around American slavery,

5
00:00:22,250 --> 00:00:26,960
12 years a slave and Django unchained,
12 years a slave of course tells the

6
00:00:26,961 --> 00:00:30,350
true story of Solomon Northup Free New
Yorker,

7
00:00:30,351 --> 00:00:34,930
who is abducted and sold into slavery
for 12 years before is fried.

8
00:00:35,420 --> 00:00:37,940
Now.
Twelve years of slave is a heavy drama

9
00:00:37,941 --> 00:00:40,820
that carries the full weight of the
horror of slavery.

10
00:00:40,880 --> 00:00:42,140
Django unchained,
however,

11
00:00:42,141 --> 00:00:46,460
is in many ways the total opposite.
I can't see fucking shit outage.

12
00:00:47,750 --> 00:00:50,030
We ready or what?
Oh,

13
00:00:50,031 --> 00:00:53,750
hold on.
I'm not going with my whole Django

14
00:00:53,810 --> 00:00:57,830
definitely has moments where the horrors
of slavery are conveyed through brutal

15
00:00:57,831 --> 00:01:00,890
and difficult scenes.
Yet it is also a term Tino film

16
00:01:00,920 --> 00:01:04,340
featuring violence as spectacle and a
big dose of comedy.

17
00:01:04,430 --> 00:01:07,140
I said Ms Dot Lowe,
goodbye,

18
00:01:08,940 --> 00:01:13,940
but
this created as is not uncommon with

19
00:01:14,691 --> 00:01:16,370
county,
no controversy.

20
00:01:16,610 --> 00:01:19,490
Media scholar,
Glenda Carpio notes that the discourse

21
00:01:19,491 --> 00:01:23,450
of race and slavery in America has
mostly gravitated towards steep

22
00:01:23,451 --> 00:01:26,660
seriousness and sensitivity.
Django unchained,

23
00:01:26,661 --> 00:01:30,860
therefore raise the question if certain
film genres such as Komani are

24
00:01:30,861 --> 00:01:34,100
inherently inadequate for capturing the
history of slavery,

25
00:01:34,370 --> 00:01:38,210
can turn and be forgiven for not
adhering to historical accuracy,

26
00:01:38,211 --> 00:01:42,080
but it's not be forgiven for striking
the quote unquote wrong tone,

27
00:01:42,140 --> 00:01:45,050
addressing such a sensitive subject,
Michelle,

28
00:01:45,051 --> 00:01:49,760
to load the this discussion as well of
historical authenticity instead of

29
00:01:49,761 --> 00:01:54,761
historical accuracy as he argues is not
only the your executive dudes over stoke

30
00:01:54,971 --> 00:01:58,490
or representation,
but also the context of its consumption

31
00:01:58,491 --> 00:02:03,230
that's determines its meaning.
Critics of Django this argued that its

32
00:02:03,231 --> 00:02:07,760
approach of humor and filing spectacle
hurts and trivializes not only the

33
00:02:07,761 --> 00:02:11,120
memory of slavery,
but also institutional racism that

34
00:02:11,130 --> 00:02:15,560
fullerton under Jim Crow and the
discussion about racism and race that is

35
00:02:15,561 --> 00:02:17,840
prevalent in American society today.

36
00:02:18,320 --> 00:02:20,630
I would argue though that this is
untrue,

37
00:02:20,660 --> 00:02:24,490
the different tonal style stanton,
new uses in Jenga and change each shift

38
00:02:24,491 --> 00:02:28,040
to own function.
In my analysis of inglorious bastards,

39
00:02:28,041 --> 00:02:32,890
I discussed how Terentino's violence,
both s entertaining spectacle and as

40
00:02:32,900 --> 00:02:35,810
something brutal and horrific as,
for example,

41
00:02:35,811 --> 00:02:39,620
white crackers pointed out,
he does the same in Django and chains to

42
00:02:39,650 --> 00:02:41,870
violence against black slaves,
his crew,

43
00:02:41,900 --> 00:02:45,500
horrific and hard to watch.
Just as in 12 years a slave.

44
00:02:45,560 --> 00:02:49,070
It drives home the horrible and gruesome
history of slavery.

45
00:02:49,490 --> 00:02:53,120
Terentino's reserves is useful.
Filings as spectacle and fun for the

46
00:02:53,121 --> 00:02:57,680
slave holders and other characters who
represent the ideology of racism and

47
00:02:57,681 --> 00:02:58,514
slavery.

48
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:17,730
No,
I find Terentino's use a few more of the

49
00:03:17,731 --> 00:03:19,890
most interesting tonal aspect of the
film.

50
00:03:20,160 --> 00:03:22,470
Well,
it's Terentino's I think realizes is

51
00:03:22,471 --> 00:03:24,960
that humor does not affect trivialize
slavery,

52
00:03:24,961 --> 00:03:28,050
birth and it has the capacity to
ridicule and it's been a ride.

53
00:03:28,051 --> 00:03:30,150
I log that,
uphold slavery,

54
00:03:30,180 --> 00:03:33,690
taking away its power and providing a
form of Catharsis.

55
00:03:34,290 --> 00:03:37,570
My name is Dr King Schults.
This is my triangle.

56
00:03:38,110 --> 00:03:43,110
These our horses totally fits.
This power of comedy is also recognized

57
00:03:44,881 --> 00:03:49,470
by a comedian such as key and peele and
Dave Chappelle who also ridicule and

58
00:03:49,530 --> 00:03:52,860
make fun of the ideology of slavery.
Not to trivialize it,

59
00:03:52,910 --> 00:03:56,670
but to take away its power.
Examples of this are seen in Django

60
00:03:56,671 --> 00:04:01,230
unchained where supposedly terrifying
clan rate is juxtaposed with ridiculous

61
00:04:01,231 --> 00:04:04,260
discussion about being unable to see two
white bags.

62
00:04:04,620 --> 00:04:05,730
Fuck all y'all.
Hold on.

63
00:04:05,790 --> 00:04:07,120
Going on.
No,

64
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:08,850
I watched my wife work.
Oh,

65
00:04:08,860 --> 00:04:11,460
day.
Get 30 bags together for you.

66
00:04:11,520 --> 00:04:15,090
Ungrateful Sons of bitches and all.
I've been here to criticize,

67
00:04:15,150 --> 00:04:16,590
criticize,
criticize.

68
00:04:18,240 --> 00:04:19,880
Don't ask me for nothing

69
00:04:21,210 --> 00:04:25,320
or key and peele skits were two slaves.
Feel rejected when they are not being

70
00:04:25,321 --> 00:04:26,820
bought during the slave auction.

71
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:31,690
It's all chins over.
It ain't over.

72
00:04:31,720 --> 00:04:34,180
It's not over.
I'm strong y'all.

73
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:36,070
I'm very shy.
I can sleep in a bucket.

74
00:04:36,130 --> 00:04:37,550
I'm fast.
I got stamina.

75
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:39,220
I don't look at.
I know magic.

76
00:04:39,250 --> 00:04:41,200
My worst quality is that I'm a
perfectionist.

77
00:04:41,290 --> 00:04:43,030
I haven't mentioned this.
Dust Silent.

78
00:04:43,690 --> 00:04:46,000
I am agreeable to a fault.

79
00:04:46,660 --> 00:04:50,530
There was also a striking similarity
between the scene where Django shoots,

80
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:52,840
slave master,
slave,

81
00:04:52,870 --> 00:04:57,460
and Dave Chappelle skit where he travels
back in time to confront a slave owner.

82
00:04:57,540 --> 00:05:01,820
He had made lanes and even get new shoes
on deck.

83
00:05:02,780 --> 00:05:05,720
I could never go out like that.
So you really free.

84
00:05:05,950 --> 00:05:07,010
Yes,
that's true.

85
00:05:09,130 --> 00:05:10,610
He didn't pull it out.
A whip.

86
00:05:11,270 --> 00:05:15,020
Nice whip.
There's there's a pistol.

87
00:05:16,010 --> 00:05:17,840
Reach Foolish Guy,
hungry.

88
00:05:20,950 --> 00:05:21,783
No,

89
00:05:37,620 --> 00:05:39,780
that's Glenda Carpio.
Rq spoke,

90
00:05:39,790 --> 00:05:44,500
Chappelle and Tino use their mediums to
affect scenes of retribution against

91
00:05:44,501 --> 00:05:47,350
slavery.
Using humor to boats sharpened the edge

92
00:05:47,370 --> 00:05:52,370
if that ritual and to highlight the
artificiality of representations in my

93
00:05:52,420 --> 00:05:55,830
few boats.
Twelve years of slave and Django and are

94
00:05:55,840 --> 00:05:58,550
excellent films.
Birth Django unchained should not be

95
00:05:58,551 --> 00:06:03,290
criticized for its use of humor around
sensitive subjects to slavery and race.

96
00:06:03,350 --> 00:06:07,820
To do so would be for guests to healing
qualities that comedy can have.

97
00:06:10,010 --> 00:06:12,410
All
right,

98
00:06:12,411 --> 00:06:15,080
thank you all for watching.
So due to a busy month,

99
00:06:15,081 --> 00:06:18,980
I wanted to do a slightly shorter video
essay about power that's company can

100
00:06:18,981 --> 00:06:23,060
have in discussing difficult subjects,
something that seems to be forgotten

101
00:06:23,061 --> 00:06:25,030
more and more these days.
Furthermore,

102
00:06:25,040 --> 00:06:27,650
