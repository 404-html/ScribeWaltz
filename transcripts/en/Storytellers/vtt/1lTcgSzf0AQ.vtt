1
00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:01.073
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2
00:00:03.430 --> 00:00:08.430
<v Speaker 2>awhile ago I stumbled upon this poem by</v>
<v Speaker 2>Charles Bukowski on what it takes to be</v>

3
00:00:09.431 --> 00:00:10.264
<v Speaker 2>a writer.</v>

4
00:00:10.640 --> 00:00:14.590
<v Speaker 3>If it doesn't come bursting out of you</v>
<v Speaker 3>in spite of everything,</v>

5
00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:20.560
<v Speaker 3>don't do it as it comes out of your</v>
<v Speaker 3>heart and your mind and your mouth and</v>

6
00:00:20.631 --> 00:00:22.250
<v Speaker 3>your gut.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Don't do it.</v>

7
00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:27.620
<v Speaker 3>If you have to sit up for hours staring</v>
<v Speaker 3>at your computer screen or hunched over</v>

8
00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:30.400
<v Speaker 3>your typewriter,</v>
<v Speaker 3>searching the words,</v>

9
00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:33.830
<v Speaker 3>don't do it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If it's hard work,</v>

10
00:00:33.890 --> 00:00:38.890
<v Speaker 3>just thinking about doing it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Don't do it unless it comes out of your</v>

11
00:00:39.261 --> 00:00:42.890
<v Speaker 3>soul like a rugged,</v>
<v Speaker 3>unless being still would drive you to</v>

12
00:00:42.891 --> 00:00:47.891
<v Speaker 3>madness or suicide or murder known.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Do it when it is truly time.</v>

13
00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:52.400
<v Speaker 3>If you have been chosen,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it will do it.</v>

14
00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:57.520
<v Speaker 3>I itself and then it will keep on doing</v>
<v Speaker 3>it until you die or it dies in you.</v>

15
00:00:59.930 --> 00:01:04.880
<v Speaker 3>There is no other way and never was.</v>

16
00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:13.240
<v Speaker 2>His message of course extends to other</v>
<v Speaker 2>creative professions from directing to</v>

17
00:01:13.610 --> 00:01:18.610
<v Speaker 2>composing music to painting or even</v>
<v Speaker 2>sports and although I think it's a</v>

18
00:01:19.371 --> 00:01:24.371
<v Speaker 2>beautiful poem and quite a romantic way</v>
<v Speaker 2>of looking at creative endeavors.</v>

19
00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:28.340
<v Speaker 2>He's also horribly and sentimentally</v>
<v Speaker 2>wrong.</v>

20
00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:34.670
<v Speaker 2>History is filled with creative geniuses</v>
<v Speaker 2>were it didn't just came bursting out of</v>

21
00:01:34.831 --> 00:01:37.470
<v Speaker 2>them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Take some of our current superintendent</v>

22
00:01:37.471 --> 00:01:38.880
<v Speaker 2>riders,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for example,</v>

23
00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:44.540
<v Speaker 2>from Aaron Sorkin who describes having a</v>
<v Speaker 2>perpetual writer's block to George r</v>

24
00:01:45.301 --> 00:01:48.660
<v Speaker 2>Martin,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who can't seem to finish his new book to</v>

25
00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:52.050
<v Speaker 2>Terentino's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who has spoken about how difficult it is</v>

26
00:01:52.051 --> 00:01:57.000
<v Speaker 2>to be staring at an empty piece of paper</v>
<v Speaker 2>where somehow his new movie needs Sapir</v>

27
00:01:57.150 --> 00:02:01.230
<v Speaker 2>and finally Robert Mckee,</v>
<v Speaker 2>writer of the Bible and screenwriting,</v>

28
00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:04.410
<v Speaker 2>who claims he is the biggest</v>
<v Speaker 2>procrastinator in the world.</v>

29
00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:09.660
<v Speaker 2>I think for these creative minds,</v>
<v Speaker 2>birth asa for you,</v>

30
00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:13.500
<v Speaker 2>me and many others,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the more excited you are about your</v>

31
00:02:13.501 --> 00:02:16.020
<v Speaker 2>creative endeavor,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the bigger the project,</v>

32
00:02:16.021 --> 00:02:19.050
<v Speaker 2>and to more important to fulfilling your</v>
<v Speaker 2>dreams,</v>

33
00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:22.350
<v Speaker 2>the harder it is to actually sit down</v>
<v Speaker 2>and do it.</v>

34
00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:24.870
<v Speaker 2>The trap that many writers,</v>
<v Speaker 2>including myself,</v>

35
00:02:24.871 --> 00:02:29.340
<v Speaker 2>fall into mainly consists of staring</v>
<v Speaker 2>motionless at a blank page.</v>

36
00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:32.610
<v Speaker 2>It's not that we don't want to write or</v>
<v Speaker 2>that we don't have the ability to put</v>

37
00:02:32.611 --> 00:02:35.730
<v Speaker 2>words down on the page.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We just don't have any good ideas.</v>

38
00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:38.340
<v Speaker 2>It's not a fun place to be.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Believe me,</v>

39
00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:43.350
<v Speaker 2>Steven Pressfield states there was a</v>
<v Speaker 2>secret that real writers know that want</v>

40
00:02:43.351 --> 00:02:45.010
<v Speaker 2>to be writer,</v>
<v Speaker 2>stones it.</v>

41
00:02:45.011 --> 00:02:49.800
<v Speaker 2>It's not the writing part that's hard.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What's hard is sitting down to write and</v>

42
00:02:49.801 --> 00:02:52.710
<v Speaker 2>he calls this force that keeps us from</v>
<v Speaker 2>sitting down.</v>

43
00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:53.820
<v Speaker 2>Resistance.</v>

44
00:02:55.680 --> 00:03:00.680
<v Speaker 2>Resistance according to Pressfield,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is what stands the life we live and are</v>

45
00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:04.600
<v Speaker 2>in lifts.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Life stands between us enter dreams or</v>

46
00:03:04.601 --> 00:03:07.630
<v Speaker 2>for we want to become and what we want</v>
<v Speaker 2>to create.</v>

47
00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:11.150
<v Speaker 2>Are you a writer that doesn't write?</v>
<v Speaker 2>A painter,</v>

48
00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:15.700
<v Speaker 2>doesn't paint an entrepreneur that never</v>
<v Speaker 2>starts adventure,</v>

49
00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:18.520
<v Speaker 2>then you have fallen victim to</v>
<v Speaker 2>resistance.</v>

50
00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:22.300
<v Speaker 2>Resistance is to be taken seriously,</v>
<v Speaker 2>says pressfield's.</v>

51
00:03:22.330 --> 00:03:26.090
<v Speaker 2>It has to be declared evil.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Millions have been defeated by it.</v>

52
00:03:26.110 --> 00:03:30.070
<v Speaker 2>Dreams of diets because one gave up or</v>
<v Speaker 2>never dare to starts.</v>

53
00:03:30.130 --> 00:03:34.270
<v Speaker 2>It is therefore essential to learn to</v>
<v Speaker 2>recognize resistance and learn how to</v>

54
00:03:34.271 --> 00:03:37.120
<v Speaker 2>beat it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Pressfield gives a beautiful description</v>

55
00:03:37.121 --> 00:03:41.140
<v Speaker 2>of resistance.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He states that resistance is invisible</v>

56
00:03:41.141 --> 00:03:44.290
<v Speaker 2>and internal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We might think that it is friends,</v>

57
00:03:44.320 --> 00:03:45.250
<v Speaker 2>jobs,</v>
<v Speaker 2>bets,</v>

58
00:03:45.251 --> 00:03:48.160
<v Speaker 2>or the Internet that keeps us from our</v>
<v Speaker 2>creative work.</v>

59
00:03:48.161 --> 00:03:49.510
<v Speaker 2>Birth that's false.</v>

60
00:03:50.590 --> 00:03:53.200
<v Speaker 4>Hungry.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I should get coffee.</v>

61
00:03:53.800 --> 00:03:56.450
<v Speaker 4>Coffee would help me think pressure,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right,</v>

62
00:03:56.451 --> 00:03:58.630
<v Speaker 4>something purse,</v>
<v Speaker 4>then reward myself with coffee,</v>

63
00:03:59.710 --> 00:04:00.790
<v Speaker 4>coffee,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and a muffin.</v>

64
00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:04.290
<v Speaker 4>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so I need to establish the scenes</v>

65
00:04:06.820 --> 00:04:09.670
<v Speaker 4>maybe been not good enough.</v>

66
00:04:10.970 --> 00:04:14.400
<v Speaker 2>The force of resistance,</v>
<v Speaker 2>stent thrombosis to engage with these</v>

67
00:04:14.401 --> 00:04:17.330
<v Speaker 2>things and procrastinates comes from</v>
<v Speaker 2>ourselves.</v>

68
00:04:17.480 --> 00:04:20.870
<v Speaker 2>Resistance is to self generate enemy</v>
<v Speaker 2>from within.</v>

69
00:04:21.980 --> 00:04:26.980
<v Speaker 2>Resistance is most commonly expressed in</v>
<v Speaker 2>procrastination because it is the</v>

70
00:04:27.081 --> 00:04:31.460
<v Speaker 2>easiest to rationalize our starts bit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll start tomorrow.</v>

71
00:04:32.050 --> 00:04:34.880
<v Speaker 5>There was one week when you wore</v>
<v Speaker 5>sweatpants.</v>

72
00:04:44.600 --> 00:04:47.210
<v Speaker 2>Of course.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Resistant school is to have a seeing</v>

73
00:04:47.211 --> 00:04:51.800
<v Speaker 2>this until our deathbeds.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Other manifestations of resistance can</v>

74
00:04:51.801 --> 00:04:54.790
<v Speaker 2>be indulging in alcohol,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sex Mr Batian,</v>

75
00:04:54.860 --> 00:04:57.260
<v Speaker 2>TV,</v>
<v Speaker 2>gossip and eating fat,</v>

76
00:04:57.261 --> 00:04:59.030
<v Speaker 2>sugar,</v>
<v Speaker 2>salt and chocolate.</v>

77
00:04:59.540 --> 00:05:04.320
<v Speaker 2>Prestfield describes that indulging is</v>
<v Speaker 2>not always a manifestation of</v>

78
00:05:04.350 --> 00:05:06.110
<v Speaker 2>resistance,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but if fuel,</v>

79
00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:10.280
<v Speaker 2>hello and unfulfilled afterwards,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's probably was.</v>

80
00:05:10.790 --> 00:05:15.440
<v Speaker 2>We subconsciously know that we gave up</v>
<v Speaker 2>our longterm goal for instant</v>

81
00:05:15.441 --> 00:05:18.380
<v Speaker 2>gratification.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Resistance Speedos?</v>

82
00:05:18.600 --> 00:05:19.360
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Out there.</v>

83
00:05:19.360 --> 00:05:22.060
<v Speaker 4>Sticking your Dick in anything that</v>
<v Speaker 4>moves.</v>

84
00:05:22.080 --> 00:05:24.220
<v Speaker 4>I'm trying to get back at me,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which is fine.</v>

85
00:05:26.050 --> 00:05:29.740
<v Speaker 4>Do you know what the worst thing is?</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're not writing.</v>

86
00:05:31.180 --> 00:05:33.610
<v Speaker 4>You have this gift.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You have this incredible talent and</v>

87
00:05:33.611 --> 00:05:36.510
<v Speaker 4>you're just flushing it down.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The toilet resistance</v>

88
00:05:36.510 --> 00:05:39.570
<v Speaker 2>expresses itself when you create drama</v>
<v Speaker 2>in your life,</v>

89
00:05:39.600 --> 00:05:43.500
<v Speaker 2>claim victim hood when you spent your</v>
<v Speaker 2>time criticizing others,</v>

90
00:05:43.560 --> 00:05:48.240
<v Speaker 2>when you turn your life into a soap or</v>
<v Speaker 2>when you rationalize a way while you</v>

91
00:05:48.241 --> 00:05:52.800
<v Speaker 2>haven't started yet as a working artist</v>
<v Speaker 2>doesn't accept this kind of self</v>

92
00:05:52.801 --> 00:05:57.240
<v Speaker 2>destructive behavior in his life because</v>
<v Speaker 2>it prevents him from his work.</v>

93
00:05:59.190 --> 00:06:03.350
<v Speaker 2>Yet resistance can be helpful.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Resistance points us to our true</v>

94
00:06:03.351 --> 00:06:06.440
<v Speaker 2>calling.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's can be felt when we fear starting a</v>

95
00:06:06.441 --> 00:06:09.170
<v Speaker 2>creative project.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Does fear mean stead?</v>

96
00:06:09.171 --> 00:06:13.400
<v Speaker 2>It is something that we need to do</v>
<v Speaker 2>something we have a deep love for.</v>

97
00:06:13.580 --> 00:06:16.550
<v Speaker 2>If she didn't love project,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's terrifying you.</v>

98
00:06:16.580 --> 00:06:18.470
<v Speaker 2>You wouldn't feel anything at all.</v>

99
00:06:20.060 --> 00:06:23.110
<v Speaker 4>You want to step on the wire.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know if I'll be able to take</v>

100
00:06:24.880 --> 00:06:25.713
<v Speaker 4>to do.</v>

101
00:06:26.160 --> 00:06:28.800
<v Speaker 2>The more resistance you feel towards the</v>
<v Speaker 2>project,</v>

102
00:06:28.801 --> 00:06:31.470
<v Speaker 2>the more fulfilled you will be when you</v>
<v Speaker 2>finish it.</v>

103
00:06:31.530 --> 00:06:34.530
<v Speaker 2>Resistance always points us to our true</v>
<v Speaker 2>north,</v>

104
00:06:35.070 --> 00:06:39.570
<v Speaker 2>so how do we consistently beat</v>
<v Speaker 2>resistance as Steven Pressfield,</v>

105
00:06:39.571 --> 00:06:43.560
<v Speaker 2>ses by turning pro as he describes</v>
<v Speaker 2>tuning pro,</v>

106
00:06:43.561 --> 00:06:48.450
<v Speaker 2>it has nothing to do with making or nuts</v>
<v Speaker 2>making money out of your creative work.</v>

107
00:06:48.780 --> 00:06:52.830
<v Speaker 2>It isn't perfect.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If philosophy of work in ideology of</v>

108
00:06:52.860 --> 00:06:56.190
<v Speaker 2>ethics on how you conduct your creative</v>
<v Speaker 2>projects,</v>

109
00:06:56.760 --> 00:07:00.060
<v Speaker 2>you can turn professional one day and</v>
<v Speaker 2>being immature again.</v>

110
00:07:00.061 --> 00:07:00.894
<v Speaker 2>The next</v>

111
00:07:02.380 --> 00:07:05.050
<v Speaker 4>in short,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was back.</v>

112
00:07:07.870 --> 00:07:08.950
<v Speaker 4>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yes,</v>

113
00:07:08.951 --> 00:07:12.520
<v Speaker 4>there is something I want to ask you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>How the fuck do you write?</v>

114
00:07:12.521 --> 00:07:17.521
<v Speaker 4>So many books so fast</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think.</v>

115
00:07:20.780 --> 00:07:23.780
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I've had a really good six months.</v>

116
00:07:23.781 --> 00:07:27.800
<v Speaker 4>I've written three chapters that you've</v>
<v Speaker 4>got three books in that time.</v>

117
00:07:28.050 --> 00:07:30.510
<v Speaker 6>The way that.</v>
<v Speaker 6>The way that I work,</v>

118
00:07:31.130 --> 00:07:34.590
<v Speaker 6>I try to get out there and I try to get</v>
<v Speaker 6>six pages a day,</v>

119
00:07:34.860 --> 00:07:39.420
<v Speaker 6>so with a book like end of watch and I</v>
<v Speaker 6>work when I'm working,</v>

120
00:07:39.421 --> 00:07:41.780
<v Speaker 6>I work every day,</v>
<v Speaker 6>three,</v>

121
00:07:41.810 --> 00:07:46.170
<v Speaker 6>four hours and I try to get those six</v>
<v Speaker 6>pages and I try to get them fairly clean</v>

122
00:07:46.260 --> 00:07:49.080
<v Speaker 6>and you do hit six pages a day.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I usually do.</v>

123
00:07:49.340 --> 00:07:54.340
<v Speaker 2>Now death is an example of a pro as</v>
<v Speaker 2>pressfield states to professional knows</v>

124
00:07:54.621 --> 00:07:59.120
<v Speaker 2>that the mundane physical act of sitting</v>
<v Speaker 2>down and starting to work sets in</v>

125
00:07:59.121 --> 00:08:02.360
<v Speaker 2>motion,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a mysterious process that produces</v>

126
00:08:02.361 --> 00:08:06.260
<v Speaker 2>inspiration.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The immature waits for inspiration.</v>

127
00:08:06.290 --> 00:08:09.110
<v Speaker 2>The professional knows that it will come</v>
<v Speaker 2>off to you.</v>

128
00:08:09.120 --> 00:08:11.180
<v Speaker 2>Starts now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as you see,</v>

129
00:08:11.210 --> 00:08:13.700
<v Speaker 2>turning pro has little to do with</v>
<v Speaker 2>talens.</v>

130
00:08:13.760 --> 00:08:18.650
<v Speaker 2>George Rr Martin is one of the most</v>
<v Speaker 2>gifted authors of generation bits.</v>

131
00:08:18.651 --> 00:08:22.900
<v Speaker 2>He hasn't turned pro,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is why I am still waiting for a</v>

132
00:08:22.920 --> 00:08:26.270
<v Speaker 2>next book.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The professional therefore x in the face</v>

133
00:08:26.271 --> 00:08:29.870
<v Speaker 2>of fear when the amateur fierce,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a big creative endeavor.</v>

134
00:08:29.871 --> 00:08:33.920
<v Speaker 2>He waits for the fear to disappear.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The professional knows this will never</v>

135
00:08:33.921 --> 00:08:38.390
<v Speaker 2>happen and starts anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and immature dreams of stardom and</v>

136
00:08:38.420 --> 00:08:41.030
<v Speaker 2>glory.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The professional has no use for this.</v>

137
00:08:41.090 --> 00:08:44.660
<v Speaker 2>He knows that success is merely a</v>
<v Speaker 2>byproduct of work.</v>

138
00:08:44.870 --> 00:08:49.140
<v Speaker 2>He does the work and let's do rewards</v>
<v Speaker 2>come or not come as they may.</v>

139
00:08:49.520 --> 00:08:53.370
<v Speaker 2>By doing this pro four,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's disappointment and Nia offer</v>

140
00:08:53.390 --> 00:08:56.340
<v Speaker 2>assistance that it will use to make us</v>
<v Speaker 2>give up.</v>

141
00:08:56.810 --> 00:09:00.420
<v Speaker 4>Are you now or have you ever been a</v>
<v Speaker 4>member of the Communist Party?</v>

142
00:09:00.740 --> 00:09:04.760
<v Speaker 4>May I introduce to evidence you are out</v>
<v Speaker 4>of order my work?</v>

143
00:09:04.830 --> 00:09:05.250
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>

144
00:09:05.250 --> 00:09:05.731
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>

145
00:09:05.731 --> 00:09:06.261
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no.</v>

146
00:09:06.261 --> 00:09:06.921
<v Speaker 4>I will.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No.</v>

147
00:09:06.921 --> 00:09:11.750
<v Speaker 4>I'm making this determination.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The chair will rule critical just a</v>

148
00:09:11.750 --> 00:09:13.370
<v Speaker 4>minute.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Your screenplays for too long.</v>

149
00:09:13.820 --> 00:09:16.280
<v Speaker 4>I've heard that before.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The professional</v>

150
00:09:16.280 --> 00:09:20.330
<v Speaker 2>also place it as it lays.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He doesn't find excuses in bed.</v>

151
00:09:20.331 --> 00:09:23.300
<v Speaker 2>Luck at food,</v>
<v Speaker 2>city or injustice needed us.</v>

152
00:09:23.301 --> 00:09:27.260
<v Speaker 2>He led a windfall or good luck for him</v>
<v Speaker 2>into thinking he is there already.</v>

153
00:09:28.300 --> 00:09:32.260
<v Speaker 4>I'll write you a movie for $1,200 and</v>
<v Speaker 4>you don't want your name on it.</v>

154
00:09:32.970 --> 00:09:34.470
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you don't want my name.</v>

155
00:09:35.370 --> 00:09:38.970
<v Speaker 2>He accepts the situation as it is the</v>
<v Speaker 2>pro marching song.</v>

156
00:09:39.180 --> 00:09:42.630
<v Speaker 2>No matter what the professional,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's go his ego.</v>

157
00:09:42.750 --> 00:09:45.570
<v Speaker 2>He doesn't take failure or success</v>
<v Speaker 2>personally.</v>

158
00:09:46.140 --> 00:09:49.800
<v Speaker 2>Fear of rejection is human and lies deep</v>
<v Speaker 2>in everyone.</v>

159
00:09:50.070 --> 00:09:53.690
<v Speaker 2>Resistance,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no stis and uses it to paralyze us and</v>

160
00:09:53.720 --> 00:09:58.400
<v Speaker 2>prevent us from doing our work.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Prestfield states that this is one of</v>

161
00:09:58.401 --> 00:10:03.170
<v Speaker 2>the hardest aspects of turning pro.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The professional puts his heart and soul</v>

162
00:10:03.171 --> 00:10:06.280
<v Speaker 2>into his work.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then he steps back and assesses the.</v>

163
00:10:06.300 --> 00:10:10.220
<v Speaker 2>It's hardly at courtly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He takes notes where he can do better.</v>

164
00:10:10.221 --> 00:10:14.000
<v Speaker 2>His next project,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then he moves on the professional.</v>

165
00:10:14.001 --> 00:10:17.420
<v Speaker 2>This accepts criticism,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's never takes it personally.</v>

166
00:10:17.660 --> 00:10:20.810
<v Speaker 2>He knows resistance will use rejection</v>
<v Speaker 2>to break him.</v>

167
00:10:21.050 --> 00:10:23.660
<v Speaker 2>Therefore,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the professional and jurors adversity</v>

168
00:10:24.140 --> 00:10:28.490
<v Speaker 2>when he's faced down in arena chewing on</v>
<v Speaker 2>sand and everyone's laughing at him,</v>

169
00:10:28.520 --> 00:10:32.940
<v Speaker 2>he knows it is still better to be in the</v>
<v Speaker 2>arena than standing on the sideline.</v>

170
00:10:34.050 --> 00:10:36.780
<v Speaker 2>Lastly,</v>
<v Speaker 2>where the amateur might make romantic</v>

171
00:10:36.781 --> 00:10:41.781
<v Speaker 2>claims about doing it for the love about</v>
<v Speaker 2>not caring or being even proud of not</v>

172
00:10:41.941 --> 00:10:45.360
<v Speaker 2>making money.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The professional recognizes that too</v>

173
00:10:45.361 --> 00:10:46.740
<v Speaker 2>much love,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we'll freeze him.</v>

174
00:10:47.220 --> 00:10:51.960
<v Speaker 2>Playing for money is to device he uses</v>
<v Speaker 2>to adopt a working men modality.</v>

175
00:10:52.230 --> 00:10:55.020
<v Speaker 2>As pressfield states the muse of</v>
<v Speaker 2>inspiration,</v>

176
00:10:55.021 --> 00:10:59.510
<v Speaker 2>loss of blue collar work ethic.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She lost a working stiff and hates prima</v>

177
00:10:59.520 --> 00:11:02.490
<v Speaker 2>donnas.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The pro takes money to turn his life</v>

178
00:11:02.640 --> 00:11:05.450
<v Speaker 2>into his job,</v>
<v Speaker 2>technically place bay,</v>

179
00:11:05.480 --> 00:11:07.980
<v Speaker 2>but in the end he does it for the love</v>
<v Speaker 2>of the game.</v>

180
00:11:11.030 --> 00:11:12.980
<v Speaker 2>At this point,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you might be thinking,</v>

181
00:11:12.981 --> 00:11:15.770
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the cold and heartless way to look at</v>

182
00:11:15.800 --> 00:11:18.590
<v Speaker 2>creative work.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Where's the romance?</v>

183
00:11:18.620 --> 00:11:22.910
<v Speaker 2>Where stem mythology to beauty and</v>
<v Speaker 2>mystery of ours.</v>

184
00:11:23.420 --> 00:11:28.310
<v Speaker 2>These are things that we aim for when we</v>
<v Speaker 2>turn pro because we know when we beat</v>

185
00:11:28.311 --> 00:11:33.311
<v Speaker 2>resistance and sit down to do our work,</v>
<v Speaker 2>something magical happens when we sit</v>

186
00:11:33.890 --> 00:11:37.010
<v Speaker 2>down and grind it out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Inspiration strikes,</v>

187
00:11:37.220 --> 00:11:41.960
<v Speaker 2>it starts to flow effortlessly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Color the flow states call it being in</v>

188
00:11:41.961 --> 00:11:46.961
<v Speaker 2>the zone or espresso fueled does call it</v>
<v Speaker 2>abuse where resistance recites and hell</v>

189
00:11:48.530 --> 00:11:53.530
<v Speaker 2>creation has a seat in heaven.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Here the Mucus looks down and my issue</v>

<v Speaker 2>the Muse will guide us battling the dark</v>

195
00:12:10.691 --> 00:12:14.380

<v Speaker 2>finish our project.</v>
