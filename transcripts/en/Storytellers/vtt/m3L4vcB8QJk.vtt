1
00:00:04.870 --> 00:00:07.840
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a couple of days after the remembrance</v>

2
00:00:07.841 --> 00:00:11.320
<v Speaker 1>of d day on the sixth of June,</v>
<v Speaker 1>1944.</v>

3
00:00:11.321 --> 00:00:16.321
<v Speaker 1>I think it is a good moment to reflect</v>
<v Speaker 1>upon how alive we'll talk to still is in</v>

4
00:00:17.231 --> 00:00:22.231
<v Speaker 1>our culture and in our hearts.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Although every year there are new films</v>

5
00:00:22.301 --> 00:00:25.180
<v Speaker 1>and TV stead deal with the Second World</v>
<v Speaker 1>War.</v>

6
00:00:25.330 --> 00:00:30.330
<v Speaker 1>The most defining of the last decades is</v>
<v Speaker 1>still by far saving private Ryan.</v>

7
00:00:31.430 --> 00:00:36.430
<v Speaker 1>The movie has taken an important role in</v>
<v Speaker 1>the public memory of words or to ask</v>

8
00:00:36.741 --> 00:00:41.000
<v Speaker 1>Mathias fiedler states now that the</v>
<v Speaker 1>generation that fought in the war is</v>

9
00:00:41.001 --> 00:00:44.450
<v Speaker 1>slowly leaving us.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Our post memory of the war becomes</v>

10
00:00:44.451 --> 00:00:48.350
<v Speaker 1>increasingly reliant on mediated images</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the past.</v>

11
00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:53.500
<v Speaker 1>Those were two movies hold a cultural</v>
<v Speaker 1>position where they actively engaged</v>

12
00:00:53.501 --> 00:00:58.400
<v Speaker 1>younger generations with the older</v>
<v Speaker 1>generation that experienced and fought</v>

13
00:00:58.430 --> 00:01:00.760
<v Speaker 1>in the war.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ryan moonroof rq,</v>

14
00:01:00.761 --> 00:01:01.760
<v Speaker 1>Istats,</v>
<v Speaker 1>watching,</v>

15
00:01:01.761 --> 00:01:06.390
<v Speaker 1>saving private Ryan became a cultural</v>
<v Speaker 1>event where different generations</v>

16
00:01:06.391 --> 00:01:11.391
<v Speaker 1>sometimes saw the movie together and</v>
<v Speaker 1>then discuss some of the pain and trauma</v>

17
00:01:11.421 --> 00:01:13.520
<v Speaker 1>that came with remembrance.</v>

18
00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:18.890
<v Speaker 1>Marianna Hirsch has coined this practice</v>
<v Speaker 1>where younger generations engaged with</v>

19
00:01:18.891 --> 00:01:23.350
<v Speaker 1>traumatic memories of all the</v>
<v Speaker 1>generations to cultural artifacts as</v>

20
00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:25.100
<v Speaker 1>post memory.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

21
00:01:25.101 --> 00:01:29.600
<v Speaker 1>to make an argument about how Saving</v>
<v Speaker 1>Private Ryan Folks Post Memory,</v>

22
00:01:29.601 --> 00:01:34.250
<v Speaker 1>we have to look at how the movie creates</v>
<v Speaker 1>a connection between the audience and</v>

23
00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:38.960
<v Speaker 1>the characters on screen since the</v>
<v Speaker 1>characters represent the soldiers that</v>

24
00:01:38.961 --> 00:01:43.470
<v Speaker 1>fought in world war two.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We can do this by exploring Marie Smith</v>

25
00:01:43.471 --> 00:01:48.471
<v Speaker 1>structure or sympathy moray device</v>
<v Speaker 1>audience identification with cinematic</v>

26
00:01:48.831 --> 00:01:52.970
<v Speaker 1>characters into central imagining and</v>
<v Speaker 1>essential imagining.</v>

27
00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:58.700
<v Speaker 1>Central imagining is when the audience</v>
<v Speaker 1>literally fuels while to characters on</v>

28
00:01:58.701 --> 00:02:00.980
<v Speaker 1>screen feel fear,</v>
<v Speaker 1>anger,</v>

29
00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:04.790
<v Speaker 1>happiness,</v>
<v Speaker 1>etc. This is what's buber primarily</v>

30
00:02:04.791 --> 00:02:08.630
<v Speaker 1>tries to achieve in the opening sequence</v>
<v Speaker 1>of saving private ryan</v>

31
00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:20.390
<v Speaker 1>using the handheld shaky cam that moves</v>
<v Speaker 1>and tax to the violence on the beach.</v>

32
00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:25.530
<v Speaker 1>Spielberg simulaTes the actual</v>
<v Speaker 1>experience of a soldier in the middle of</v>

33
00:02:25.531 --> 00:02:29.610
<v Speaker 1>it as the camera functions as the eyes</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the viewer,</v>

34
00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:34.520
<v Speaker 1>humorous made to feel as if he is in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>middle of the violence and trauma of</v>

35
00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:37.710
<v Speaker 1>war.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Closing the gap between the audience and</v>

36
00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:41.700
<v Speaker 1>the characters on screen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Spew book then in fights is food into</v>

37
00:02:41.701 --> 00:02:45.690
<v Speaker 1>the subjective experience of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>soldiers on screen by using sound</v>

38
00:02:45.691 --> 00:02:48.780
<v Speaker 1>effects that conveyed the shell shock of</v>
<v Speaker 1>the soldiers</v>

39
00:02:55.150 --> 00:02:58.510
<v Speaker 1>central imagining,</v>
<v Speaker 1>however asked me criticized since it is</v>

40
00:02:58.511 --> 00:03:02.050
<v Speaker 1>impossible,</v>
<v Speaker 1>achieve it completely in spite of all</v>

41
00:03:02.051 --> 00:03:05.410
<v Speaker 1>the cinematic techniques,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the audience contrary to the characters</v>

42
00:03:05.411 --> 00:03:09.250
<v Speaker 1>on screen and soldiers they represent</v>
<v Speaker 1>back in 1944,</v>

43
00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:14.340
<v Speaker 1>is still safely watching in a theater,</v>
<v Speaker 1>turning the violence and horror of war</v>

44
00:03:14.820 --> 00:03:18.580
<v Speaker 1>into spectacle.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Therefore,</v>

45
00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:23.440
<v Speaker 1>one straw to foa one stated that there</v>
<v Speaker 1>is no such thing as an antiwar movie.</v>

46
00:03:23.740 --> 00:03:26.290
<v Speaker 1>Stills,</v>
<v Speaker 1>spielberg takes a mighty shots at</v>

47
00:03:26.350 --> 00:03:30.850
<v Speaker 1>evoking an effective central imagining</v>
<v Speaker 1>and not completely successful,</v>

48
00:03:30.851 --> 00:03:35.590
<v Speaker 1>I would say since there were reports or</v>
<v Speaker 1>federal having ptsd attacks.</v>

49
00:03:35.591 --> 00:03:39.370
<v Speaker 1>Upon screening a movie,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it is clear that spielberg has in a way</v>

50
00:03:39.371 --> 00:03:43.480
<v Speaker 1>succeeded in having us audience</v>
<v Speaker 1>experienced the horrors of war.</v>

51
00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:48.840
<v Speaker 1>Contrary to central imagining a or</v>
<v Speaker 1>imagining is where the fewer stones</v>

52
00:03:49.151 --> 00:03:52.060
<v Speaker 1>literally fueled the same things as the</v>
<v Speaker 1>characters.</v>

53
00:03:52.061 --> 00:03:52.841
<v Speaker 1>Birth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Instead,</v>

54
00:03:52.841 --> 00:03:57.841
<v Speaker 1>sympathize with their experience.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Smith subdivides this into recognition,</v>

55
00:03:58.270 --> 00:04:03.270
<v Speaker 1>alignment and allegiance recognition</v>
<v Speaker 1>being simply recognizing characters as</v>

56
00:04:04.541 --> 00:04:05.790
<v Speaker 1>who they are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>men,</v>

57
00:04:05.830 --> 00:04:07.480
<v Speaker 1>women,</v>
<v Speaker 1>american soldiers,</v>

58
00:04:07.481 --> 00:04:09.220
<v Speaker 1>german soldiers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>etc.</v>

59
00:04:09.520 --> 00:04:14.520
<v Speaker 1>Alignment is when the audience gets</v>
<v Speaker 1>access to the experience and thinking of</v>

60
00:04:14.591 --> 00:04:17.980
<v Speaker 1>the characters,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and allegiance is when the audience has</v>

61
00:04:17.981 --> 00:04:22.300
<v Speaker 1>evaluated the characters moral choices</v>
<v Speaker 1>and start rooting for them.</v>

62
00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:27.670
<v Speaker 1>I would argue that safe and private</v>
<v Speaker 1>ryan's narrative structure is designed</v>

63
00:04:27.671 --> 00:04:31.150
<v Speaker 1>to have the audience build a strong</v>
<v Speaker 1>allegiance with the characters on</v>

64
00:04:31.151 --> 00:04:33.520
<v Speaker 1>screen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>After the opening sequence,</v>

65
00:04:33.521 --> 00:04:36.610
<v Speaker 1>the film narrows in on a small group of</v>
<v Speaker 1>soldiers.</v>

66
00:04:36.640 --> 00:04:39.730
<v Speaker 1>Those costs were 12,</v>
<v Speaker 1>saving private ryan.</v>

67
00:04:40.060 --> 00:04:43.060
<v Speaker 1>Throughout the film,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we stay close to these men and their</v>

68
00:04:43.061 --> 00:04:46.600
<v Speaker 1>experiences creating a lot of time to</v>
<v Speaker 1>bond with them.</v>

69
00:04:47.320 --> 00:04:52.320
<v Speaker 1>Saving private ryan is not unique in</v>
<v Speaker 1>this many war films focus on a small set</v>

70
00:04:52.601 --> 00:04:57.390
<v Speaker 1>of characters in the myths of huge</v>
<v Speaker 1>historical offense as stalin wants.</v>

71
00:04:57.391 --> 00:04:59.740
<v Speaker 1>Sets one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Death is a tragedy.</v>

72
00:05:00.010 --> 00:05:03.970
<v Speaker 1>A million deaths is a statistic in</v>
<v Speaker 1>saving private ryan.</v>

73
00:05:03.971 --> 00:05:07.390
<v Speaker 1>The audience connects strongly with a</v>
<v Speaker 1>small group of soldiers.</v>

74
00:05:07.390 --> 00:05:11.890
<v Speaker 1>She has these characters represent the</v>
<v Speaker 1>american soldiers in world war two as a</v>

75
00:05:11.891 --> 00:05:15.340
<v Speaker 1>whole.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is a much more effective way of</v>

76
00:05:15.400 --> 00:05:17.110
<v Speaker 1>evoking posts memory,</v>
<v Speaker 1>dan,</v>

77
00:05:17.111 --> 00:05:18.180
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>90,</v>

78
00:05:18.210 --> 00:05:23.210
<v Speaker 1>60 to the longest day where we see dna</v>
<v Speaker 1>from a lot more angles and with a lot</v>

79
00:05:23.891 --> 00:05:27.250
<v Speaker 1>more characters.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This gives some more complete oversight</v>

80
00:05:27.251 --> 00:05:30.280
<v Speaker 1>of dda,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yet it feels to establish a strong</v>

81
00:05:30.281 --> 00:05:34.840
<v Speaker 1>connection between the audience and the</v>
<v Speaker 1>characters on screen and this who they</v>

82
00:05:34.841 --> 00:05:37.540
<v Speaker 1>represent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Finally,</v>

83
00:05:37.541 --> 00:05:42.541
<v Speaker 1>saving private ryan begins and ends with</v>
<v Speaker 1>a scene of private ryan in current day</v>

84
00:05:43.360 --> 00:05:46.180
<v Speaker 1>attending the crosses of his fallen</v>
<v Speaker 1>saviors.</v>

85
00:05:46.480 --> 00:05:48.880
<v Speaker 1>This is a clear reminder to the</v>
<v Speaker 1>audience.</v>

86
00:05:48.881 --> 00:05:52.990
<v Speaker 1>They're the generation that followed in</v>
<v Speaker 1>and survived the second world war is</v>

87
00:05:52.991 --> 00:05:56.500
<v Speaker 1>still among us.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was arguing with speed work and tom</v>

88
00:05:56.501 --> 00:06:00.560
<v Speaker 1>hanks achieved the same effect even</v>
<v Speaker 1>better in band of brothers and two</v>

89
00:06:00.561 --> 00:06:04.630
<v Speaker 1>pacific.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My opens each episode with interviews of</v>

90
00:06:04.640 --> 00:06:07.490
<v Speaker 1>the actual soldiers that are portrayed</v>
<v Speaker 1>on screen.</v>

91
00:06:08.030 --> 00:06:12.560
<v Speaker 1>My generation is I think the last</v>
<v Speaker 1>generation that can personally talk to</v>

92
00:06:12.561 --> 00:06:15.980
<v Speaker 1>veterans of world war two.</v>
<v Speaker 1>As roy metcalfe states,</v>

93
00:06:16.010 --> 00:06:20.890
<v Speaker 1>the gis are leaving us now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>leaving us a priceless legacy and this</v>

94
00:06:20.910 --> 00:06:25.910
<v Speaker 1>the responsibility of keeping a life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Their experiences in our cultural memory</v>

95
00:06:26.061 --> 00:06:30.680
<v Speaker 1>will rest more and more upon the films</v>
<v Speaker 1>and series that's portrayed him.</v>

96
00:06:34.010 --> 00:06:37.310
<v Speaker 1>Thank you all for watching.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This video turned out a little bit</v>

97
00:06:37.311 --> 00:06:41.600
<v Speaker 1>different than our plans since I wanted</v>
<v Speaker 1>to compare saving private ryan tuerck</v>

98
00:06:41.630 --> 00:06:46.630
<v Speaker 1>german show called muto until father a</v>
<v Speaker 1>that uses the same techniques to give a</v>

99
00:06:47.211 --> 00:06:49.850
<v Speaker 1>different perspective on the german side</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the war.</v>

100
00:06:50.270 --> 00:06:54.940
<v Speaker 1>It has to audience sympathize with</v>
<v Speaker 1>normal german soldiers also being fixed</v>

101
00:06:54.941 --> 00:06:57.190
<v Speaker 1>in terms of the nazi regime.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

102
00:06:57.200 --> 00:07:00.950
<v Speaker 1>unfortunately german copyright law made</v>
<v Speaker 1>it impossible anyway.</v>

103
00:07:00.951 --> 00:07:04.550
<v Speaker 1>If you want to support us,</v>
