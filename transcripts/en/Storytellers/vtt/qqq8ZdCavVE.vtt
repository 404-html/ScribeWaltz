1
00:00:00.480 --> 00:00:03.570
<v Speaker 1>But I'll give you one quick example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I say,</v>

2
00:00:03.571 --> 00:00:05.760
<v Speaker 1>and it's fairly standard because I</v>
<v Speaker 1>believe it strongly,</v>

3
00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:10.170
<v Speaker 1>the American dream is dead,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I'm going to make it bigger and</v>

4
00:00:10.171 --> 00:00:11.310
<v Speaker 1>stronger and better.</v>

5
00:00:13.420 --> 00:00:18.310
<v Speaker 1>I think it's safe to say that social</v>
<v Speaker 1>tensions within Western society have</v>

6
00:00:18.311 --> 00:00:22.780
<v Speaker 1>risen dramatically since the century.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How do you elicit concepts like</v>

7
00:00:22.781 --> 00:00:26.560
<v Speaker 1>multiculturalism and the American dream</v>
<v Speaker 1>has come under increasing amounts of</v>

8
00:00:26.561 --> 00:00:30.250
<v Speaker 1>scrutiny from all sides of the political</v>
<v Speaker 1>spectrum and the Mitsui growing</v>

9
00:00:30.251 --> 00:00:33.010
<v Speaker 1>suspicion,</v>
<v Speaker 1>discontent over matters like government,</v>

10
00:00:33.130 --> 00:00:34.600
<v Speaker 1>race,</v>
<v Speaker 1>ethnicity,</v>

11
00:00:34.630 --> 00:00:36.070
<v Speaker 1>gender,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and religion.</v>

12
00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:39.670
<v Speaker 1>There's the realization that we've</v>
<v Speaker 1>become so self aware that we've become</v>

13
00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:44.350
<v Speaker 1>too scared to even have an honest debate</v>
<v Speaker 1>about these very subjects that have</v>

14
00:00:44.351 --> 00:00:48.880
<v Speaker 1>since become taboo.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And in order to evaluate our relations,</v>

15
00:00:48.881 --> 00:00:53.350
<v Speaker 1>you concept like the American dream,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we might just have to look in one of the</v>

16
00:00:53.351 --> 00:00:55.480
<v Speaker 1>most unexpected of places,</v>

17
00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:00.140
<v Speaker 2>la,</v>
<v Speaker 2>la,</v>

18
00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:01.313
<v Speaker 2>la,</v>
<v Speaker 2>la,</v>

19
00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:02.150
<v Speaker 2>la,</v>
<v Speaker 2>la,</v>

20
00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:02.983
<v Speaker 2>la,</v>
<v Speaker 2>la.</v>

21
00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:09.740
<v Speaker 1>Now you don't have to be an analytical</v>
<v Speaker 1>genius to understand.</v>

22
00:01:09.741 --> 00:01:12.750
<v Speaker 1>And Harold and Kumar,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's about far more than the struggle to</v>

23
00:01:12.751 --> 00:01:15.390
<v Speaker 1>young potheads the perfect fast food</v>

24
00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:18.840
<v Speaker 2>this night,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the American dream.</v>

25
00:01:19.690 --> 00:01:21.670
<v Speaker 1>So let's talk about the American dream</v>
<v Speaker 1>for a second,</v>

26
00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:25.110
<v Speaker 1>generally defined as the ideals of</v>
<v Speaker 1>freedom and equality for all American</v>

27
00:01:25.111 --> 00:01:27.010
<v Speaker 1>citizens,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but maybe most importantly,</v>

28
00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:29.290
<v Speaker 1>it's the guarantee that within this</v>
<v Speaker 1>landscape,</v>

29
00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:33.310
<v Speaker 1>every individual has the opportunity to</v>
<v Speaker 1>achieve success in whatever it is they</v>

30
00:01:33.311 --> 00:01:35.020
<v Speaker 1>might pursue.</v>
<v Speaker 1>On a surface level,</v>

31
00:01:35.021 --> 00:01:38.080
<v Speaker 1>it seems that the movie aligns itself,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Isi Culture,</v>

32
00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:41.620
<v Speaker 1>as the story's about two members of</v>
<v Speaker 1>minority groups trying to seeing the</v>

33
00:01:41.621 --> 00:01:45.280
<v Speaker 1>fruits of that concept that should be</v>
<v Speaker 1>readily available to every American by</v>

34
00:01:45.281 --> 00:01:46.270
<v Speaker 1>default.</v>
<v Speaker 1>However,</v>

35
00:01:46.271 --> 00:01:49.090
<v Speaker 1>we only have to examine the two main</v>
<v Speaker 1>protagonists who discovered it.</v>

36
00:01:49.091 --> 00:01:54.091
<v Speaker 1>This observation is in fact false.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Both Harold and Kumar seemed to embody</v>

37
00:01:54.281 --> 00:01:58.420
<v Speaker 1>the group in the stereotypical Asian</v>
<v Speaker 1>American and Indian American.</v>

38
00:01:58.660 --> 00:02:01.750
<v Speaker 1>Harold is shown to be hardworking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>anxiety,</v>

39
00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:04.060
<v Speaker 1>non provoking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and shy.</v>

40
00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:09.750
<v Speaker 1>Waterfalls and studer group identity of</v>
<v Speaker 1>the smart,</v>

41
00:02:09.751 --> 00:02:12.720
<v Speaker 1>well educated Indian American.</v>
<v Speaker 1>With the talent for the medical</v>

42
00:02:12.721 --> 00:02:15.510
<v Speaker 1>professions,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it quickly becomes clear ever.</v>

43
00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:18.390
<v Speaker 1>There's more to the east characters and</v>
<v Speaker 1>just their stereotypes.</v>

44
00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:20.580
<v Speaker 1>I can't party tonight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

45
00:02:20.581 --> 00:02:22.230
<v Speaker 1>I going to stay late at the office.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Dude.</v>

46
00:02:22.231 --> 00:02:24.300
<v Speaker 1>Fuck that shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We had friends I know,</v>

47
00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:27.510
<v Speaker 1>but I got a lot of work to do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When is getting high ever prevented you</v>

48
00:02:27.511 --> 00:02:32.511
<v Speaker 1>from doing your work</v>
<v Speaker 1>held in whom are actually shown Zvi</v>

49
00:02:33.291 --> 00:02:36.040
<v Speaker 1>route or a stereotypical as they smoke</v>
<v Speaker 1>weed,</v>

50
00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:40.120
<v Speaker 1>pursue sexual desires and make quads I</v>
<v Speaker 1>racist jokes through their friends.</v>

51
00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:44.640
<v Speaker 1>You you'd use think about tits homes is</v>
<v Speaker 1>there also seemed to be highly conscious</v>

52
00:02:44.641 --> 00:02:46.720
<v Speaker 1>of their struggle with their proposed</v>
<v Speaker 1>group identity.</v>

53
00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:49.890
<v Speaker 1>Kumar has no interest in as far as the</v>
<v Speaker 1>man that he becomes.</v>

54
00:02:49.891 --> 00:02:54.740
<v Speaker 1>A dark room is dirty and filled to the</v>
<v Speaker 1>brim with posters or black rep artists</v>

55
00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:58.760
<v Speaker 1>and attempt to appropriate black culture</v>
<v Speaker 1>in favor of his own federal,</v>

56
00:02:58.820 --> 00:03:02.100
<v Speaker 1>on other hand,</v>
<v Speaker 1>still actively Ozon to a large part of</v>

57
00:03:02.101 --> 00:03:06.160
<v Speaker 1>his group and you showed you more</v>
<v Speaker 1>hesitant and Kumar to break away from</v>

58
00:03:06.161 --> 00:03:10.080
<v Speaker 1>his character traits cleared at both</v>
<v Speaker 1>harold and Kumar have a desire to be</v>

59
00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:14.260
<v Speaker 1>someone else to be their own versus at</v>
<v Speaker 1>the beginning of the movie,</v>

60
00:03:14.261 --> 00:03:17.800
<v Speaker 1>both characters are essentially stuck in</v>
<v Speaker 1>their struggle to find your own</v>

61
00:03:17.801 --> 00:03:20.580
<v Speaker 1>identities in relation to their proposed</v>
<v Speaker 1>group.</v>

62
00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:24.730
<v Speaker 1>They're both stereotypical as well as a</v>
<v Speaker 1>stereotypical.</v>

63
00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:25.071
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

64
00:03:25.071 --> 00:03:25.301
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

65
00:03:25.301 --> 00:03:25.541
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

66
00:03:25.541 --> 00:03:30.541
<v Speaker 1>I don't like breaking the law,</v>
<v Speaker 1>makes very clear that is not doing a way</v>

67
00:03:30.970 --> 00:03:35.970
<v Speaker 1>with ethical stereotypes what is ratter</v>
<v Speaker 1>and quite literally poking holes in</v>

68
00:03:36.641 --> 00:03:40.220
<v Speaker 1>them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in fact,</v>

69
00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:44.920
<v Speaker 1>poking holes into stereotypes but not</v>
<v Speaker 1>doing away with them completely becomes</v>

70
00:03:44.921 --> 00:03:47.440
<v Speaker 1>one of the main themes of the movie.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They have a Gelato,</v>

71
00:03:47.460 --> 00:03:49.810
<v Speaker 1>evangelicals,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this multiethnic comedy,</v>

72
00:03:50.140 --> 00:03:53.230
<v Speaker 1>because a story allows the main</v>
<v Speaker 1>characters to interact with people from</v>

73
00:03:53.231 --> 00:03:56.040
<v Speaker 1>a variety of ethnic groups.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Instead of focusing on a group,</v>

74
00:03:56.050 --> 00:03:58.960
<v Speaker 1>the main characters themselves during</v>
<v Speaker 1>these interactions,</v>

75
00:03:58.961 --> 00:04:02.830
<v Speaker 1>Harold and discovered that they choose</v>
<v Speaker 1>are guilty of stereotyping potters</v>

76
00:04:02.980 --> 00:04:07.030
<v Speaker 1>because every person they need one of</v>
<v Speaker 1>their quote unquote reality bubbles pop.</v>

77
00:04:07.240 --> 00:04:09.320
<v Speaker 1>First off,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Harold was hesitant to spend time with</v>

78
00:04:09.321 --> 00:04:12.880
<v Speaker 1>the East Asian Club at Stanford as it</v>
<v Speaker 1>seemed to embody to fool stereotypical</v>

79
00:04:12.881 --> 00:04:14.910
<v Speaker 1>group identity of Asian Americans,</v>
<v Speaker 1>humanity,</v>

80
00:04:14.950 --> 00:04:18.610
<v Speaker 1>just to avoid having to go to party only</v>
<v Speaker 1>to find out that there are parties are</v>

81
00:04:18.611 --> 00:04:19.630
<v Speaker 1>absolutely crazy.</v>

82
00:04:25.190 --> 00:04:26.230
<v Speaker 3>Stick it hit you,</v>

83
00:04:27.970 --> 00:04:30.570
<v Speaker 1>Tamara meats too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Posh British girls who want to meet up</v>

84
00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:33.390
<v Speaker 1>for a night of fun and it turned to</v>
<v Speaker 1>prevent is harold and Kumar.</v>

85
00:04:33.391 --> 00:04:37.350
<v Speaker 1>Ended up in the girl's bathroom and find</v>
<v Speaker 1>out just how class you'd these ladies</v>

86
00:04:37.410 --> 00:04:38.243
<v Speaker 1>are</v>

87
00:04:41.980 --> 00:04:46.950
<v Speaker 1>later on if it was shown to be an overly</v>
<v Speaker 1>stereotypical Jesus loving redneck Kumar</v>

88
00:04:46.960 --> 00:04:50.230
<v Speaker 1>clearly uncomfortable around him and so</v>
<v Speaker 1>he tells them that are allowed to have</v>

89
00:04:50.231 --> 00:04:55.231
<v Speaker 1>sex with his wife.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Lastly,</v>

90
00:04:57.670 --> 00:05:01.150
<v Speaker 1>when Harold ends up in police custody</v>
<v Speaker 1>after having punched a police officer,</v>

91
00:05:01.390 --> 00:05:04.030
<v Speaker 1>he needs a black American man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but this time is different.</v>

92
00:05:04.031 --> 00:05:06.720
<v Speaker 1>Demand doesn't look like the</v>
<v Speaker 1>stereotypical like plug.</v>

93
00:05:07.060 --> 00:05:10.630
<v Speaker 1>It seems to be quite the opposite.</v>
<v Speaker 1>As he's reading a compilation of essays</v>

94
00:05:10.631 --> 00:05:14.200
<v Speaker 1>called civil disobedience.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He explained to commodity has been</v>

95
00:05:14.201 --> 00:05:16.930
<v Speaker 1>arrested unfairly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then ads that he doesn't get too worked</v>

96
00:05:16.931 --> 00:05:17.764
<v Speaker 1>up about it</v>

97
00:05:18.620 --> 00:05:22.660
<v Speaker 4>in the end,</v>
<v Speaker 4>universe tends done as it should</v>

98
00:05:24.330 --> 00:05:26.440
<v Speaker 4>have a really large penis that keeps me</v>
<v Speaker 4>happy.</v>

99
00:05:27.850 --> 00:05:31.480
<v Speaker 1>Not the first line is arguably the most</v>
<v Speaker 1>important line of the entire movie,</v>

100
00:05:31.730 --> 00:05:35.260
<v Speaker 1>and I'll get back to that in a second,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the second line obviously reinforces</v>

101
00:05:35.261 --> 00:05:39.970
<v Speaker 1>a stereotype of black men and their son.</v>
<v Speaker 1>David Jolanta explains this recurring</v>

102
00:05:40.030 --> 00:05:42.970
<v Speaker 1>theme and at the movie Los,</v>
<v Speaker 1>every guy to identify themselves in</v>

103
00:05:42.971 --> 00:05:46.390
<v Speaker 1>relation to the stereotypes about your</v>
<v Speaker 1>ethical group is not to say that all the</v>

104
00:05:46.391 --> 00:05:49.720
<v Speaker 1>minority characters in our Kumar,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sharon's been victims of his legacy.</v>

105
00:05:50.110 --> 00:05:52.960
<v Speaker 1>On the contrary,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even the one person who can legitimately</v>

106
00:05:52.961 --> 00:05:56.500
<v Speaker 1>be seen as a victim refuses to see</v>
<v Speaker 1>himself as such.</v>

107
00:05:56.710 --> 00:05:57.471
<v Speaker 1>In.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Besides that,</v>

108
00:05:57.471 --> 00:06:00.250
<v Speaker 1>most of the auto minority characters</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't seem to take their ethnical</v>

109
00:06:00.270 --> 00:06:03.950
<v Speaker 1>identities very seriously and even</v>
<v Speaker 1>actively engaged in self ridiculed.</v>

110
00:06:04.230 --> 00:06:05.970
<v Speaker 2>You know the Holocaust?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

111
00:06:06.300 --> 00:06:07.980
<v Speaker 2>picture the exact opposite of that.</v>

112
00:06:10.400 --> 00:06:14.060
<v Speaker 1>There still definitely an argument to be</v>
<v Speaker 1>made how Harold and Kumar are being held</v>

113
00:06:14.061 --> 00:06:17.180
<v Speaker 1>back by external forces who seem to be</v>
<v Speaker 1>predominantly white.</v>

114
00:06:17.300 --> 00:06:20.570
<v Speaker 1>It's no coincidence that the castle to</v>
<v Speaker 1>the American dream is called white</v>

115
00:06:20.571 --> 00:06:23.030
<v Speaker 1>guests,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but as we've seen how leukemia is not</v>

116
00:06:23.031 --> 00:06:25.970
<v Speaker 1>about complete generalizations and</v>
<v Speaker 1>victimization,</v>

117
00:06:26.120 --> 00:06:27.950
<v Speaker 1>and this seems to be the last bubble to</v>
<v Speaker 1>pop.</v>

118
00:06:28.030 --> 00:06:28.863
<v Speaker 1>We're two friends,</v>

119
00:06:40.870 --> 00:06:45.610
<v Speaker 1>extreme sports bullies and racist cops</v>
<v Speaker 1>are ultimately arrested by police</v>

120
00:06:45.611 --> 00:06:48.200
<v Speaker 1>officers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Even Neil Patrick Harris redeems himself</v>

121
00:06:48.220 --> 00:06:51.040
<v Speaker 1>by being for Hilton Kumar's food as</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're stealing their car.</v>

122
00:06:51.220 --> 00:06:53.710
<v Speaker 1>So it seems to intellectual black guy</v>
<v Speaker 1>was right,</v>

123
00:06:53.800 --> 00:06:54.850
<v Speaker 1>the universe,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Dustin,</v>

124
00:06:54.851 --> 00:06:59.080
<v Speaker 1>to shoot in the end,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how whom I reached their American dream,</v>

125
00:06:59.320 --> 00:07:03.430
<v Speaker 1>harold finally rebels against his own</v>
<v Speaker 1>conformity with social conditioning as</v>

126
00:07:03.431 --> 00:07:06.310
<v Speaker 1>he stands up to his coworkers and</v>
<v Speaker 1>ultimately gets the girl.</v>

127
00:07:06.560 --> 00:07:07.570
<v Speaker 1>Kumar,</v>
<v Speaker 1>on the other hand,</v>

128
00:07:07.571 --> 00:07:11.410
<v Speaker 1>is now more accepted of his ability to</v>
<v Speaker 1>potentially become a great surgeon and</v>

129
00:07:11.411 --> 00:07:15.670
<v Speaker 1>decides that it's time to let go of</v>
<v Speaker 1>resisting the Spartan you make do with</v>

130
00:07:15.671 --> 00:07:17.980
<v Speaker 1>what you have.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Seems to be the central message here.</v>

131
00:07:18.310 --> 00:07:19.960
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there will always be people who are</v>

132
00:07:19.961 --> 00:07:21.400
<v Speaker 1>living a little easier.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>

133
00:07:21.401 --> 00:07:23.680
<v Speaker 1>there were always real assholes and</v>
<v Speaker 1>bigots.</v>

134
00:07:24.070 --> 00:07:26.920
<v Speaker 1>There will always be individuals trying</v>
<v Speaker 1>to hold you back,</v>

135
00:07:27.250 --> 00:07:30.580
<v Speaker 1>but it's up to you whether you let that</v>
<v Speaker 1>affect you in whether you can allow</v>

136
00:07:30.581 --> 00:07:33.400
<v Speaker 1>yourself to not take everything so</v>
<v Speaker 1>seriously.</v>

137
00:07:36.070 --> 00:07:39.130
<v Speaker 1>It's our own convictions and our</v>
<v Speaker 1>perception of the world that can hold us</v>

138
00:07:39.131 --> 00:07:42.130
<v Speaker 1>back the most.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's why Harold and Kumar is about the</v>

139
00:07:42.131 --> 00:07:45.190
<v Speaker 1>American dream.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's about reevaluating yourself within</v>

140
00:07:45.191 --> 00:07:48.080
<v Speaker 1>the spectrum of group identity and</v>
<v Speaker 1>individuality to them,</v>

141
00:07:48.090 --> 00:07:53.090
<v Speaker 1>proactively work your way towards that</v>
<v Speaker 1>dream to let go of victim and to find</v>

142
00:07:53.231 --> 00:07:55.000
<v Speaker 1>the courage to teach or lead.</v>

143
00:07:55.120 --> 00:07:55.953
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>great.</v>
