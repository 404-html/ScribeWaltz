00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:02.620
<v Speaker 1>Thank you to squarespace for sponsoring</v>
<v Speaker 1>this video</v>

2
00:00:07.220 --> 00:00:11.900
<v Speaker 1>for as long as we know the existence of</v>
<v Speaker 1>border walls and boundaries have gone</v>

3
00:00:11.901 --> 00:00:16.310
<v Speaker 1>hand in hand with the development of</v>
<v Speaker 1>civilization and the human experience as</v>

4
00:00:16.311 --> 00:00:21.311
<v Speaker 1>a whole and the evilness 2015 film</v>
<v Speaker 1>sicario disorder manifests itself in the</v>

5
00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:25.190
<v Speaker 1>physical fence,</v>
<v Speaker 1>separating cartel infested Mexico from</v>

6
00:00:25.191 --> 00:00:26.870
<v Speaker 1>the United States.</v>
<v Speaker 1>However,</v>

7
00:00:26.871 --> 00:00:30.410
<v Speaker 1>the violence and chaos of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>neighboring country is slowly but surely</v>

8
00:00:30.411 --> 00:00:33.560
<v Speaker 1>creeping its way into the backyard of</v>
<v Speaker 1>the American society,</v>

9
00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:38.420
<v Speaker 1>unseen by most yet visible and ever</v>
<v Speaker 1>grown to dos who know where to look.</v>

10
00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:42.560
<v Speaker 1>Kate Macer as part of an FBI getting</v>
<v Speaker 1>that response unit that's been engaged</v>

11
00:00:42.561 --> 00:00:46.820
<v Speaker 1>in cleaning up the mess of this ever</v>
<v Speaker 1>expanding problem in a lot of ways.</v>

12
00:00:46.821 --> 00:00:49.970
<v Speaker 1>Her story is similar to that of Keller</v>
<v Speaker 1>Dover from Vilnius,</v>

13
00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:53.390
<v Speaker 1>prisoners,</v>
<v Speaker 1>kate or Macer to her colleagues is again</v>

14
00:00:53.391 --> 00:00:58.010
<v Speaker 1>a character with a strong moral compass</v>
<v Speaker 1>and a principle belief system as a</v>

15
00:00:58.011 --> 00:01:01.670
<v Speaker 1>strict agent of order and the law she</v>
<v Speaker 1>believes in speaking the truth without</v>

16
00:01:01.671 --> 00:01:05.090
<v Speaker 1>question the statement,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what do you want me to stay to work the</v>

17
00:01:05.091 --> 00:01:07.130
<v Speaker 1>truth with our last name?</v>

18
00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:11.480
<v Speaker 1>Appropriately reflecting her disposition</v>
<v Speaker 1>as a strong representative of justice</v>

19
00:01:11.481 --> 00:01:14.660
<v Speaker 1>and the law and liked the inciting</v>
<v Speaker 1>incident of the illness,</v>

20
00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:17.790
<v Speaker 1>kidnapping mystery.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It is a southern and unexpectedly</v>

21
00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:21.590
<v Speaker 1>malevolent event that kickstarts the</v>
<v Speaker 1>protagonist journey into a confusing,</v>

22
00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:26.300
<v Speaker 1>morally chaotic world where her belief</v>
<v Speaker 1>system will be tested and blur to its</v>

23
00:01:26.301 --> 00:01:28.680
<v Speaker 1>core.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just traumatic event push escapes.</v>

24
00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:33.650
<v Speaker 1>You volunteer for a task force led by</v>
<v Speaker 1>the ambiguous and unconventional Matt</v>

25
00:01:33.650 --> 00:01:37.550
<v Speaker 1>Graves with a mission devil take her to</v>
<v Speaker 1>the border of a country as well as the</v>

26
00:01:37.551 --> 00:01:41.090
<v Speaker 1>boundary of her own lawful world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>According to Jonathan,</v>

27
00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:45.200
<v Speaker 1>the archetype of the board are commonly</v>
<v Speaker 1>symbolizes the world at the limit,</v>

28
00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:47.780
<v Speaker 1>a place at the bottom,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and at the margin.</v>

29
00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:51.410
<v Speaker 1>It's a symbol of a place in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>periphery that protects the order of the</v>

30
00:01:51.411 --> 00:01:55.610
<v Speaker 1>center from the chaos of the unknown,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's often also a realm Verdi's.</v>

31
00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:59.300
<v Speaker 1>Two categories meet and become</v>
<v Speaker 1>interlinked and where it a difference</v>

32
00:01:59.301 --> 00:02:03.290
<v Speaker 1>between the two isn't always obvious and</v>
<v Speaker 1>thus it's a place where to garden.</v>

33
00:02:03.291 --> 00:02:06.170
<v Speaker 1>Heroes tend to be shown as hybrid beings</v>
<v Speaker 1>of sorts.</v>

34
00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:08.660
<v Speaker 1>Possessing elements from both sides of</v>
<v Speaker 1>the border</v>

35
00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:14.970
<v Speaker 1>for Matt and his team working in between</v>
<v Speaker 1>the lines of the law is the only way to</v>

36
00:02:14.971 --> 00:02:18.390
<v Speaker 1>effectively protect the center.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Matt is shown to be both a</v>

37
00:02:18.391 --> 00:02:23.370
<v Speaker 1>representative of order</v>
<v Speaker 1>as well as an agent of chaos.</v>

38
00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:26.400
<v Speaker 2>Doing here is you're giving us the</v>
<v Speaker 2>opportunity to shake the tree,</v>

39
00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:27.890
<v Speaker 2>create chaos.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's what it is.</v>

40
00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:31.520
<v Speaker 1>There's moral hybridity is further</v>
<v Speaker 1>depicted through aerial shots of the</v>

41
00:02:31.521 --> 00:02:34.700
<v Speaker 1>boarder landscape with it's beige colors</v>
<v Speaker 1>and rugged terrain,</v>

42
00:02:34.701 --> 00:02:39.680
<v Speaker 1>promoting descents of moral ambiguity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Kate being an emissary of law and order</v>

43
00:02:39.681 --> 00:02:43.190
<v Speaker 1>with the illuminating light of moral</v>
<v Speaker 1>truth shining onto her,</v>

44
00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:46.970
<v Speaker 1>goes into the unknown.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Unprepared and ill equipped attempting</v>

45
00:02:46.971 --> 00:02:50.960
<v Speaker 1>to stay within the confines of the law,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but ultimately being unable to keep the</v>

46
00:02:50.961 --> 00:02:55.070
<v Speaker 1>chaos from invading her world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Symbolical level of Kate's initial</v>

47
00:02:55.071 --> 00:02:57.930
<v Speaker 1>vision of our journey starts off fairly</v>
<v Speaker 1>archetypical.</v>

48
00:02:58.280 --> 00:03:02.120
<v Speaker 1>The cartels did devils that threatened</v>
<v Speaker 1>to order and harmony of the center or</v>

49
00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:05.110
<v Speaker 1>seem to be infiltrating ever deeper into</v>
<v Speaker 1>the country.</v>

50
00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:08.410
<v Speaker 1>To restore this order and bring those</v>
<v Speaker 1>responsible to justice,</v>

51
00:03:08.411 --> 00:03:12.940
<v Speaker 1>she has to descend into chaos,</v>
<v Speaker 1>into the layer of the snake or the Cave</v>

52
00:03:12.941 --> 00:03:16.090
<v Speaker 1>of the beast.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This beast initially become strongly</v>

53
00:03:16.091 --> 00:03:18.850
<v Speaker 1>identified with the violence of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>cartels in general,</v>

54
00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:21.010
<v Speaker 1>and the city of chorus in particular</v>

55
00:03:21.890 --> 00:03:24.020
<v Speaker 3>is obese.</v>

56
00:03:24.820 --> 00:03:27.100
<v Speaker 1>However,</v>
<v Speaker 1>her fellow task force members seemed to</v>

57
00:03:27.101 --> 00:03:30.610
<v Speaker 1>be participating and even reveling in</v>
<v Speaker 1>the lawlessness of the city.</v>

58
00:03:30.960 --> 00:03:34.650
<v Speaker 3>Brilliant what they do when they</v>
<v Speaker 3>mutilated body like that.</v>

59
00:03:35.210 --> 00:03:38.630
<v Speaker 1>As a representative of the law.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Kate's presence then begins to put an</v>

60
00:03:38.631 --> 00:03:42.860
<v Speaker 1>increasing amount of physical and mental</v>
<v Speaker 1>pressure on her conscience as she</v>

61
00:03:42.861 --> 00:03:45.950
<v Speaker 1>quickly picks up smoking to cope with</v>
<v Speaker 1>this new reality.</v>

62
00:03:46.310 --> 00:03:49.100
<v Speaker 1>This evolution is mirrored by the</v>
<v Speaker 1>character of Sylvio,</v>

63
00:03:49.220 --> 00:03:53.660
<v Speaker 1>serving as a cautionary tale for Kate</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sylvio is her Mexican counterpart in law</v>

64
00:03:53.661 --> 00:03:55.520
<v Speaker 1>enforcement,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a godly man,</v>

65
00:03:55.521 --> 00:03:59.540
<v Speaker 1>and a father of a son who is desperately</v>
<v Speaker 1>trying to keep away from the chaos of</v>

66
00:03:59.541 --> 00:04:02.240
<v Speaker 1>the outside world as much as possible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

67
00:04:02.900 --> 00:04:04.730
<v Speaker 1>However,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's revealed that Sylvia has been</v>

68
00:04:04.731 --> 00:04:08.570
<v Speaker 1>corrupted by the cartel and is quite</v>
<v Speaker 1>obviously struggling with this reality</v>

69
00:04:08.571 --> 00:04:12.950
<v Speaker 1>as he's often framed in a shadow smoking</v>
<v Speaker 1>cigarettes by the dozens and using</v>

70
00:04:12.980 --> 00:04:15.950
<v Speaker 1>alcohol to set up a barrier for his own</v>
<v Speaker 1>conscience,</v>

71
00:04:16.220 --> 00:04:19.280
<v Speaker 1>but whereas Sylvia's principals have</v>
<v Speaker 1>already been sacrificed,</v>

72
00:04:19.281 --> 00:04:21.510
<v Speaker 1>skate is showing you still be fighting</v>
<v Speaker 1>for hers.</v>

73
00:04:21.590 --> 00:04:23.480
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that was fucking illegal.</v>

74
00:04:23.510 --> 00:04:26.740
<v Speaker 1>You want to start a war,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's not long thereafter that she to</v>

75
00:04:26.741 --> 00:04:31.110
<v Speaker 1>realize is that the order she represents</v>
<v Speaker 1>has been turning a blind eye to the</v>

76
00:04:31.111 --> 00:04:33.320
<v Speaker 1>activities of maths,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hybrid heroes.</v>

77
00:04:33.410 --> 00:04:36.080
<v Speaker 1>So if your fear is operating out of</v>
<v Speaker 1>bounds,</v>

78
00:04:36.410 --> 00:04:38.900
<v Speaker 1>I am telling you you are not.</v>

79
00:04:41.090 --> 00:04:44.750
<v Speaker 1>Boundaries been moved.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This granting or permission by Kate</v>

80
00:04:44.750 --> 00:04:48.260
<v Speaker 1>Superior symbolizes the archetype of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>wise skiing or fodder culture,</v>

81
00:04:48.380 --> 00:04:52.790
<v Speaker 1>turning a blind eye or being naive or</v>
<v Speaker 1>oblivious due to dealing with chaotic,</v>

82
00:04:52.791 --> 00:04:54.770
<v Speaker 1>tyrannical,</v>
<v Speaker 1>broader or advisor,</v>

83
00:04:55.100 --> 00:04:58.370
<v Speaker 1>and it's this looking away that allows</v>
<v Speaker 1>for the boundary of operational</v>

84
00:04:58.371 --> 00:05:02.450
<v Speaker 1>procedures to be shifted across the</v>
<v Speaker 1>border and it has a helping hand and</v>

85
00:05:02.451 --> 00:05:06.790
<v Speaker 1>blurring the boundaries of order and</v>
<v Speaker 1>chaos and that represents gates own or</v>

86
00:05:06.920 --> 00:05:10.490
<v Speaker 1>change in her world view.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Pivotal in this individual shift of</v>

87
00:05:10.491 --> 00:05:13.220
<v Speaker 1>boundaries are to characters of Reggie</v>
<v Speaker 1>and Alejandro.</v>

88
00:05:13.550 --> 00:05:17.270
<v Speaker 1>Reggie is shown to be kate's most</v>
<v Speaker 1>trusted friend into force and symbolizes</v>

89
00:05:17.271 --> 00:05:19.670
<v Speaker 1>every aspect of kate that aligns with</v>
<v Speaker 1>truth,</v>

90
00:05:19.730 --> 00:05:22.730
<v Speaker 1>law and order,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's precisely because of this that</v>

91
00:05:22.731 --> 00:05:27.731
<v Speaker 1>Matt does not want him on his team.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Reggie functions as irrational moral</v>

92
00:05:29.391 --> 00:05:33.470
<v Speaker 1>guide of order for Kate always seeing</v>
<v Speaker 1>dressed in blue and guiding k to seek</v>

93
00:05:33.471 --> 00:05:35.870
<v Speaker 1>the truth and state in line with the</v>
<v Speaker 1>code of law</v>

94
00:05:36.080 --> 00:05:36.913
<v Speaker 3>cake,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but</v>

95
00:05:38.480 --> 00:05:40.140
<v Speaker 3>you don't have to do this.</v>

96
00:05:40.370 --> 00:05:44.420
<v Speaker 1>Alejandro on the other hand is somewhat</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the polar opposite of Reggie being</v>

97
00:05:44.421 --> 00:05:47.130
<v Speaker 1>driven by strong emotional feelings of</v>
<v Speaker 1>hatred.</v>

98
00:05:47.150 --> 00:05:51.410
<v Speaker 1>The former prosecutor turned lawless,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hitman works for anyone who will set him</v>

99
00:05:51.411 --> 00:05:54.020
<v Speaker 1>loose on the people who killed his wife</v>
<v Speaker 1>and daughter.</v>

100
00:05:54.350 --> 00:05:57.740
<v Speaker 1>Alejandro is an agent of chaos,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a mysterious man.</v>

101
00:05:57.741 --> 00:06:00.590
<v Speaker 1>A few words often seen shrouded by</v>
<v Speaker 1>darkness,</v>

102
00:06:00.740 --> 00:06:04.940
<v Speaker 1>but ever present in the background.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He is a man who seems to have lost most</v>

103
00:06:04.941 --> 00:06:09.230
<v Speaker 1>of his humanity along the way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>either being referred to bias John Wick</v>

104
00:06:09.231 --> 00:06:12.750
<v Speaker 1>like nickname or as an animal or</v>
<v Speaker 1>fencing,</v>

105
00:06:14.960 --> 00:06:19.670
<v Speaker 1>and even a Frankenstein monster or</v>
<v Speaker 1>emissary of the devil as he sets his</v>

106
00:06:19.671 --> 00:06:21.640
<v Speaker 1>sights on Fausto,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all our con,</v>

107
00:06:21.920 --> 00:06:26.530
<v Speaker 1>the man responsible for the destruction</v>
<v Speaker 1>of his family appropriately named effort</v>

108
00:06:26.531 --> 00:06:29.450
<v Speaker 1>go to faust,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a man who has sold his soul to the devil</v>

109
00:06:29.451 --> 00:06:31.970
<v Speaker 1>and who ultimately has to face the</v>
<v Speaker 1>consequences.</v>

110
00:06:32.240 --> 00:06:35.750
<v Speaker 1>Both these two characters influenced</v>
<v Speaker 1>gate and seem to function as agents of</v>

111
00:06:35.780 --> 00:06:39.530
<v Speaker 1>order and chaos respectively,</v>
<v Speaker 1>both from the real world as well as</v>

112
00:06:39.531 --> 00:06:42.050
<v Speaker 1>symbolically indicates own internal</v>
<v Speaker 1>world.</v>

113
00:06:42.110 --> 00:06:46.160
<v Speaker 1>We can see how Reggie's influence over</v>
<v Speaker 1>gate starts to dwindle as he unknowingly</v>

114
00:06:46.161 --> 00:06:49.310
<v Speaker 1>sets her up with her would be hitman</v>
<v Speaker 1>with our orderly site,</v>

115
00:06:49.311 --> 00:06:50.960
<v Speaker 1>blinded.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's only fitting then at.</v>

116
00:06:50.980 --> 00:06:54.800
<v Speaker 1>Alondra appears over her like a shadow</v>
<v Speaker 1>just at the right time.</v>

117
00:06:55.400 --> 00:06:58.010
<v Speaker 1>After this moment,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it is Alejandro who moves into the</v>

118
00:06:58.011 --> 00:07:00.440
<v Speaker 1>foreground and takes on a role as her</v>
<v Speaker 1>guardian.</v>

119
00:07:00.980 --> 00:07:05.240
<v Speaker 1>This unconscious shift into chaos can</v>
<v Speaker 1>also be seen in Kate's increasing lack</v>

120
00:07:05.241 --> 00:07:10.241
<v Speaker 1>of personal hygiene,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's a shift that comes to a climax</v>

121
00:07:13.551 --> 00:07:15.560
<v Speaker 1>in the mace,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like layer of the beast,</v>

122
00:07:15.950 --> 00:07:20.330
<v Speaker 1>both Reggie and all 100 venture into</v>
<v Speaker 1>different paths and although Reggie</v>

123
00:07:20.331 --> 00:07:25.070
<v Speaker 1>orders k to stay behind him,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she chooses to follow 100 instead and</v>

124
00:07:25.071 --> 00:07:28.530
<v Speaker 1>it's here at the center of the maze that</v>
<v Speaker 1>she discovers that her supposed to</v>

125
00:07:28.531 --> 00:07:33.290
<v Speaker 1>protect her and her and Zack agonist are</v>
<v Speaker 1>one and the same and ironically it's in</v>

126
00:07:33.291 --> 00:07:37.910
<v Speaker 1>her personal mission to tame chaos back</v>
<v Speaker 1>into order that she herself is the one</v>

127
00:07:37.911 --> 00:07:42.230
<v Speaker 1>who was brought to her knees in the end</v>
<v Speaker 1>to perceive archetypal narrative of the</v>

128
00:07:42.231 --> 00:07:46.690
<v Speaker 1>hero slaying the beast who terrorizes</v>
<v Speaker 1>the land is then suddenly subverted by a</v>

129
00:07:46.691 --> 00:07:51.460
<v Speaker 1>story more akin to that of the garden of</v>
<v Speaker 1>Eden cade wanting to deal with the</v>

130
00:07:51.461 --> 00:07:56.090
<v Speaker 1>increasing infestation of chaos as a</v>
<v Speaker 1>representative of order was unknowingly</v>

131
00:07:56.091 --> 00:07:58.340
<v Speaker 1>lured into tigray world of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>periphery.</v>

132
00:07:58.600 --> 00:08:02.030
<v Speaker 1>Tempted by the potential outcome of</v>
<v Speaker 1>finally dealing with the layer of the</v>

133
00:08:02.031 --> 00:08:06.230
<v Speaker 1>snake to goodbye from the apple.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Only to realize that dealing with one</v>

134
00:08:06.231 --> 00:08:09.440
<v Speaker 1>snake would only allow for another to</v>
<v Speaker 1>rise to power.</v>

135
00:08:14.200 --> 00:08:16.580
<v Speaker 1>In the end,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she's left shrouded from the light that</v>

136
00:08:16.581 --> 00:08:20.870
<v Speaker 1>had one shine onto her having been made</v>
<v Speaker 1>conscious overall mortality and</v>

137
00:08:20.871 --> 00:08:23.690
<v Speaker 1>fragility as well as that of the order</v>
<v Speaker 1>she serves.</v>

138
00:08:23.990 --> 00:08:27.680
<v Speaker 1>Alejandro forces her to finally sign</v>
<v Speaker 1>away her principles,</v>

139
00:08:27.830 --> 00:08:32.150
<v Speaker 1>the last holdout for the boundary that</v>
<v Speaker 1>is now collapsing all around her and</v>

140
00:08:32.151 --> 00:08:34.160
<v Speaker 1>escaped his left,</v>
<v Speaker 1>broken and alone.</v>

141
00:08:34.430 --> 00:08:39.320
<v Speaker 1>A new force moves into the foreground</v>
<v Speaker 1>emerging as a representative of chaos.</v>

142
00:08:39.590 --> 00:08:43.250
<v Speaker 1>Alejandro replaces the core stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The father who's death has just been</v>

143
00:08:43.251 --> 00:08:48.020
<v Speaker 1>signed and echoes in a new era in which</v>
<v Speaker 1>the boundaries of the order of law have</v>

144
00:08:48.021 --> 00:08:48.854
<v Speaker 1>no place.</v>

145
00:09:02.710 --> 00:09:05.040
<v Speaker 1>Alright guys,</v>
