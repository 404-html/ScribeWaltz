00:00:03.080 --> 00:00:08.080
<v Speaker 1>One of the best films that I saw in 2014</v>
<v Speaker 1>was two grand Budapest hotel,</v>

2
00:00:08.810 --> 00:00:13.810
<v Speaker 1>written and directed by West Anderson</v>
<v Speaker 1>was Edison is of course known for</v>

3
00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:18.860
<v Speaker 1>distinctive style in particular his</v>
<v Speaker 1>fullness for perfectly symmetrical</v>

4
00:00:18.861 --> 00:00:22.580
<v Speaker 1>shots,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which she spoke loft and hated for as</v>

5
00:00:22.581 --> 00:00:26.960
<v Speaker 1>less than some screenplays states.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Some people consider west Anderson a</v>

6
00:00:26.961 --> 00:00:31.940
<v Speaker 1>genius death converse conventional film</v>
<v Speaker 1>language into its own dialectic while</v>

7
00:00:31.950 --> 00:00:36.800
<v Speaker 1>others claim it is artfulness mistake</v>
<v Speaker 1>and for art film devoid of meaning.</v>

8
00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:42.110
<v Speaker 1>I think these opposing opinions own wes</v>
<v Speaker 1>Anderson style stem from a fundamental</v>

9
00:00:42.111 --> 00:00:46.850
<v Speaker 1>paradox in how people look at movies and</v>
<v Speaker 1>even broader nature.</v>

10
00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:52.190
<v Speaker 1>Perfect symmetry is a natural and</v>
<v Speaker 1>conventional cinematic language is</v>

11
00:00:52.191 --> 00:00:55.370
<v Speaker 1>designed to have the audience not notice</v>
<v Speaker 1>consciously,</v>

12
00:00:55.371 --> 00:00:59.000
<v Speaker 1>at least the manufactured nature or what</v>
<v Speaker 1>happens on screen.</v>

13
00:00:59.270 --> 00:01:03.620
<v Speaker 1>West Anderson therefore draws attention</v>
<v Speaker 1>away from the story and characters on</v>

14
00:01:03.621 --> 00:01:06.170
<v Speaker 1>screen and to watch his cinematic style.</v>

15
00:01:06.470 --> 00:01:08.540
<v Speaker 1>Yet,</v>
<v Speaker 1>although symmetry is a natural,</v>

16
00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:13.040
<v Speaker 1>people do find it beautiful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's movies therefore function more as a</v>

17
00:01:13.041 --> 00:01:16.700
<v Speaker 1>painting or storybook than conventional</v>
<v Speaker 1>narrative cinema.</v>

18
00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:20.320
<v Speaker 1>I was argued this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that it is critical for us and listen to</v>

19
00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:25.330
<v Speaker 1>match this narrative characters and</v>
<v Speaker 1>dialogue with a cinematic style so that</v>

20
00:01:25.491 --> 00:01:28.610
<v Speaker 1>is fewer accepted as fitting instead of</v>
<v Speaker 1>all natural,</v>

21
00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:33.670
<v Speaker 1>and I think he does this perfectly and</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Grand Budapest hotel where a</v>

22
00:01:33.751 --> 00:01:38.240
<v Speaker 1>moonrise kingdom and as soon alludes to</v>
<v Speaker 1>a cinematic stele mimicking the metrical</v>

23
00:01:38.241 --> 00:01:42.140
<v Speaker 1>storybooks,</v>
<v Speaker 1>susie bishop carries twitter in the</v>

24
00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:44.450
<v Speaker 1>Grand Budapest hotel.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He creates a frame story,</v>

25
00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:48.020
<v Speaker 1>a story within a story,</v>
<v Speaker 1>within a story,</v>

26
00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:52.250
<v Speaker 1>within a story.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He even matches the aspect ratio of the</v>

27
00:01:52.251 --> 00:01:54.950
<v Speaker 1>narratives,</v>
<v Speaker 1>different time periods to the aspect</v>

28
00:01:54.951 --> 00:01:58.430
<v Speaker 1>ratio that was confessional for cinema</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the years.</v>

29
00:01:58.450 --> 00:02:01.310
<v Speaker 1>The story finance itself to this frame</v>
<v Speaker 1>story,</v>

30
00:02:01.311 --> 00:02:06.311
<v Speaker 1>the Grand Budapest hotel is submersed in</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ostalgie throwing us back into a more</v>

31
00:02:06.621 --> 00:02:10.640
<v Speaker 1>elegant time or aristocracy is civility</v>
<v Speaker 1>and taste.</v>

32
00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:15.020
<v Speaker 1>This nostalgia is towards the magical</v>
<v Speaker 1>world of the past,</v>

33
00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:18.920
<v Speaker 1>or even as his hinted or Walter Earth is</v>
<v Speaker 1>even older.</v>

34
00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:22.870
<v Speaker 2>To be frank,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think his world had vanished long</v>

35
00:02:22.871 --> 00:02:27.430
<v Speaker 2>before he ever rented it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I will say he certainly sustained</v>

36
00:02:27.431 --> 00:02:29.380
<v Speaker 2>the illusion with a marvelous grace.</v>

37
00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:34.830
<v Speaker 1>I would say that this nostalgic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>elegant world matches perfectly with</v>

38
00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:38.680
<v Speaker 1>innocence painting slash storybook,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like cinematic style.</v>

39
00:02:38.770 --> 00:02:43.750
<v Speaker 1>Even the 40 aspect ratio of the 19</v>
<v Speaker 1>thirties that he uses for the part of</v>

40
00:02:43.751 --> 00:02:48.320
<v Speaker 1>the story that is set in that time</v>
<v Speaker 1>period works excellent for symmetric</v>

41
00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:51.910
<v Speaker 1>shots.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is all even further complemented by</v>

42
00:02:51.911 --> 00:02:55.690
<v Speaker 1>the dialogue.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Once you Gustaf especially converses in</v>

43
00:02:55.691 --> 00:02:58.990
<v Speaker 1>an elegant aristocratic way which is in</v>
<v Speaker 1>tune.</v>

44
00:02:59.320 --> 00:03:01.450
<v Speaker 1>The magical world that is created</v>

45
00:03:02.270 --> 00:03:05.120
<v Speaker 2>rudeness is merely the expression of</v>
<v Speaker 2>fear.</v>

46
00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:07.400
<v Speaker 2>People fear they won't get what they</v>
<v Speaker 2>want.</v>

47
00:03:07.790 --> 00:03:11.780
<v Speaker 2>The most dreadful and unattractive</v>
<v Speaker 2>person earlier needs to be loved and</v>

48
00:03:11.781 --> 00:03:15.500
<v Speaker 2>they will open up like a flower.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm reminded of a verse.</v>

49
00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:18.620
<v Speaker 2>The painter's brush touch the incubate</v>
<v Speaker 2>phase,</v>

50
00:03:18.890 --> 00:03:22.920
<v Speaker 2>ends of Nimble bristles and color.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Granted,</v>

51
00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:23.810
<v Speaker 2>her life is cheap.</v>

52
00:03:24.730 --> 00:03:28.900
<v Speaker 1>The danger of this or wherever it is</v>
<v Speaker 1>that this dialogue cool to receive the</v>

53
00:03:28.901 --> 00:03:33.901
<v Speaker 1>same critique as wes Anderson cinematic</v>
<v Speaker 1>style often does that it is pretentious</v>

54
00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:40.060
<v Speaker 1>and listen solstice by frequently having</v>
<v Speaker 1>mature Gustaf breaking as elegant.</v>

55
00:03:40.061 --> 00:03:42.190
<v Speaker 1>Speaking with a more professional tone.</v>

56
00:03:42.890 --> 00:03:45.380
<v Speaker 2>I've never seen her like that before.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

57
00:03:45.381 --> 00:03:48.140
<v Speaker 2>sir.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She was shaking like a shitting dog.</v>

58
00:03:50.030 --> 00:03:50.863
<v Speaker 2>Truly,</v>

59
00:03:51.210 --> 00:03:55.680
<v Speaker 1>this creates comedic moments and serves</v>
<v Speaker 1>as a wink to the audience.</v>

60
00:03:55.770 --> 00:03:58.610
<v Speaker 1>It shows an awareness of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>criticalness style</v>

61
00:03:59.650 --> 00:04:04.390
<v Speaker 2>you see that are still glimmers of</v>
<v Speaker 2>civilization left and this barbaric</v>

62
00:04:04.391 --> 00:04:06.490
<v Speaker 2>slaughter house that was once known as</v>
<v Speaker 2>humanity.</v>

63
00:04:07.030 --> 00:04:08.800
<v Speaker 2>Indeed,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's what we provide in our own</v>

64
00:04:08.830 --> 00:04:10.060
<v Speaker 2>modest,</v>
<v Speaker 2>humble,</v>

65
00:04:10.150 --> 00:04:12.810
<v Speaker 2>insignificant.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

66
00:04:15.570 --> 00:04:19.710
<v Speaker 1>Another problem is that by drawing</v>
<v Speaker 1>attention to a cinematic style,</v>

67
00:04:19.711 --> 00:04:22.950
<v Speaker 1>wes Anderson,</v>
<v Speaker 1>districts and distances to audience from</v>

68
00:04:22.951 --> 00:04:25.410
<v Speaker 1>the emotional lives of the characters on</v>
<v Speaker 1>screen.</v>

69
00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:30.560
<v Speaker 1>Most of innocence films are a mixture of</v>
<v Speaker 1>tragedy and comedy is cinematic style</v>

70
00:04:31.411 --> 00:04:35.160
<v Speaker 1>works perfectly for comedic purposes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>For example,</v>

71
00:04:35.190 --> 00:04:37.650
<v Speaker 1>I think people entered a frame in many</v>
<v Speaker 1>ways,</v>

72
00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:41.970
<v Speaker 1>just like Edgar Wright sometimes does</v>
<v Speaker 1>birth more central to establish our.</v>

73
00:04:41.971 --> 00:04:44.490
<v Speaker 1>His tracking shots is tableau shots.</v>

74
00:04:44.760 --> 00:04:48.390
<v Speaker 2>He's a ruthless adventure of a con</v>
<v Speaker 2>artist who preys on mentally sick.</v>

75
00:04:48.391 --> 00:04:53.070
<v Speaker 2>Old Ladies probably box them to bed with</v>
<v Speaker 2>all my friends.</v>

76
00:05:02.840 --> 00:05:07.700
<v Speaker 1>This tableau shot of mature Gustaf in</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jill created an absurdity death folks</v>

77
00:05:07.820 --> 00:05:11.210
<v Speaker 1>after birth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It also distracts from the seriousness</v>

78
00:05:11.211 --> 00:05:15.650
<v Speaker 1>of his situation because when it comes</v>
<v Speaker 1>to more serious emotional moments,</v>

79
00:05:15.651 --> 00:05:19.550
<v Speaker 1>it is precisely this kind of shot that</v>
<v Speaker 1>can distance the audience from the</v>

80
00:05:19.551 --> 00:05:22.160
<v Speaker 1>characters.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In previous movies,</v>

81
00:05:22.161 --> 00:05:26.090
<v Speaker 1>Edison therefore returned to cinematic</v>
<v Speaker 1>techniques outside of his own style.</v>

82
00:05:26.150 --> 00:05:28.430
<v Speaker 1>During these moments,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

83
00:05:28.431 --> 00:05:32.900
<v Speaker 1>he returns to the more conventional over</v>
<v Speaker 1>the shoulder shots in moonrise kingdom.</v>

84
00:05:32.901 --> 00:05:37.901
<v Speaker 1>When Sam and Susie confessed the love</v>
<v Speaker 1>for each other as bought all states at</v>

85
00:05:38.271 --> 00:05:41.570
<v Speaker 1>an emotional peak,</v>
<v Speaker 1>innocence sharply violates the film's</v>

86
00:05:41.571 --> 00:05:44.690
<v Speaker 1>intrinsic norm by bringing in their</v>
<v Speaker 1>common technique.</v>

87
00:05:45.110 --> 00:05:48.110
<v Speaker 1>West Emerson doesn't do this in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>Grand Budapest hotel,</v>

88
00:05:48.111 --> 00:05:51.240
<v Speaker 1>however,</v>
<v Speaker 1>birth uses lighting color and some</v>

89
00:05:51.740 --> 00:05:55.940
<v Speaker 1>techniques that fit within this</v>
<v Speaker 1>intrinsic style to convey important</v>

90
00:05:55.941 --> 00:06:00.050
<v Speaker 1>emotional moments.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The audience in this tableau shots,</v>

91
00:06:00.080 --> 00:06:04.550
<v Speaker 1>a lighting change signifies that a more</v>
<v Speaker 1>serious moment is about to happen,</v>

92
00:06:04.640 --> 00:06:08.700
<v Speaker 1>and another line inq combined with a</v>
<v Speaker 1>closeup focuses on the tears.</v>

93
00:06:08.950 --> 00:06:09.950
<v Speaker 1>Old Zero.</v>

94
00:06:10.090 --> 00:06:11.170
<v Speaker 2>You see,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I never speak to him,</v>

95
00:06:11.200 --> 00:06:15.070
<v Speaker 2>I guess because even the thought of her</v>
<v Speaker 2>name,</v>

96
00:06:15.520 --> 00:06:20.520
<v Speaker 2>I'm unable to control my emotions.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

97
00:06:21.631 --> 00:06:23.100
<v Speaker 2>I suppose there's no way around it.</v>

98
00:06:23.880 --> 00:06:27.930
<v Speaker 1>In a similar way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a shelter is to convey Agatha so love of</v>

99
00:06:27.931 --> 00:06:32.760
<v Speaker 1>serious life center usher in a close up</v>
<v Speaker 1>with soft lighting and light circling</v>

100
00:06:32.761 --> 00:06:36.960
<v Speaker 1>binder.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wes Anderson also use objects and</v>

101
00:06:36.990 --> 00:06:41.990
<v Speaker 1>positioning to convey emotional cues</v>
<v Speaker 1>when we see more sugary stuff in his</v>

102
00:06:42.481 --> 00:06:45.660
<v Speaker 1>solitary small room where he eats dinner</v>
<v Speaker 1>alone,</v>

103
00:06:45.661 --> 00:06:48.370
<v Speaker 1>which is a break with the royal elegant</v>
<v Speaker 1>self-assured,</v>

104
00:06:48.390 --> 00:06:50.940
<v Speaker 1>Short speaking persona of material</v>
<v Speaker 1>stuff.</v>

105
00:06:51.180 --> 00:06:53.890
<v Speaker 1>The camera lights over a couple of</v>
<v Speaker 1>bottles layer,</v>

106
00:06:53.891 --> 00:06:58.890
<v Speaker 1>the peneche his favorite perfume.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Perfume is this part of his more</v>

107
00:06:58.891 --> 00:07:03.540
<v Speaker 1>intimate and it's rather lonely</v>
<v Speaker 1>personality when he shares this perfume</v>

108
00:07:03.541 --> 00:07:08.541
<v Speaker 1>with zero does signify serious access to</v>
<v Speaker 1>star spiritual world and their deep</v>

109
00:07:09.271 --> 00:07:10.104
<v Speaker 1>friendship.</v>

110
00:07:10.620 --> 00:07:14.690
<v Speaker 2>I owe you my life.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You are my dear friend and process.</v>

111
00:07:15.340 --> 00:07:16.310
<v Speaker 2>Every private,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you.</v>

112
00:07:16.710 --> 00:07:20.510
<v Speaker 2>You must admit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm so sorry he's here.</v>

113
00:07:22.790 --> 00:07:23.623
<v Speaker 2>We're brothers.</v>

114
00:07:26.460 --> 00:07:29.730
<v Speaker 1>We can also see this in their positions</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the frame,</v>

115
00:07:29.880 --> 00:07:33.450
<v Speaker 1>in the beginning of the film,</v>
<v Speaker 1>zero is often seen in the background.</v>

116
00:07:33.480 --> 00:07:36.750
<v Speaker 1>While most sugar stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the more dominating character at that</v>

117
00:07:36.751 --> 00:07:40.380
<v Speaker 1>point is shown larger and closer to the</v>
<v Speaker 1>front of the frame.</v>

118
00:07:40.710 --> 00:07:45.030
<v Speaker 1>The same compositional structure can be</v>
<v Speaker 1>seen with the antagonist of the film</v>

119
00:07:45.600 --> 00:07:48.780
<v Speaker 1>birth with regards to Ciro and more good</v>
<v Speaker 1>stuff.</v>

120
00:07:48.840 --> 00:07:51.630
<v Speaker 1>Later in the film,</v>
<v Speaker 1>their friendship develops and they</v>

121
00:07:51.631 --> 00:07:54.380
<v Speaker 1>become more equals zero rescue of</v>
<v Speaker 1>material,</v>

122
00:07:54.430 --> 00:07:58.020
<v Speaker 1>good stuff from jail.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We see this shift within the mission</v>

123
00:07:58.050 --> 00:08:01.290
<v Speaker 1>seven s,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they both now shared frame more equally</v>

124
00:08:01.780 --> 00:08:05.880
<v Speaker 1>yet it's the most clear example where</v>
<v Speaker 1>wes Anderson cues and important</v>

125
00:08:05.881 --> 00:08:09.930
<v Speaker 1>emotional moments too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Cinematic style is in the train scene</v>

126
00:08:09.931 --> 00:08:13.560
<v Speaker 1>near the end.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This scene is similar to an earlier</v>

127
00:08:13.561 --> 00:08:16.680
<v Speaker 1>train scene,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yet completely different where the first</v>

128
00:08:16.681 --> 00:08:21.450
<v Speaker 1>train scene is shown in warm colors and</v>
<v Speaker 1>there was room for comedic moments.</v>

129
00:08:21.920 --> 00:08:25.120
<v Speaker 2>It's not a very flattering portrait.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm afraid I was once considered a great</v>

130
00:08:25.130 --> 00:08:29.400
<v Speaker 2>but</v>
<v Speaker 2>wants the f stand for Fritz France,</v>

131
00:08:29.860 --> 00:08:31.520
<v Speaker 2>France.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I knew it.</v>

132
00:08:31.830 --> 00:08:36.390
<v Speaker 1>West End Shin shows the later train</v>
<v Speaker 1>scene in black and white to convey what</v>

133
00:08:36.391 --> 00:08:41.391
<v Speaker 1>would be one of the saddest days of life</v>
<v Speaker 1>when will show stuff is shoved debt.</v>

134
00:08:43.390 --> 00:08:46.680
<v Speaker 3>What happened in the end and the and</v>

135
00:08:46.680 --> 00:08:51.680
<v Speaker 1>they shot him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The grants Budapest hotel signifies,</v>

136
00:08:52.341 --> 00:08:56.100
<v Speaker 1>I think the peak of West innocence</v>
<v Speaker 1>ability folk,</v>

137
00:08:56.101 --> 00:09:01.101
<v Speaker 1>both comedy as emotional strategy to his</v>
<v Speaker 1>own distinctive cinematic style.</v>

138
00:09:02.130 --> 00:09:05.460
<v Speaker 1>The film is a wonderful mix of charm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>humor,</v>

139
00:09:05.461 --> 00:09:10.461
<v Speaker 1>and sadness accumulation off west</v>
<v Speaker 1>innocence work as a director and writer</v>
