1
00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:06.870
<v Speaker 1>For me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A movie that's brilliantly combines both</v>

2
00:00:06.871 --> 00:00:11.340
<v Speaker 1>cinematic storytelling and social</v>
<v Speaker 1>critique is David fincher's,</v>

3
00:00:11.341 --> 00:00:16.230
<v Speaker 1>the social network,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the movie centers around it's Mark</v>

4
00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:20.010
<v Speaker 1>Zuckerburg plate by Jesse Eisenberg and</v>
<v Speaker 1>the creation of facebook.</v>

5
00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:25.450
<v Speaker 1>Now the work of director David fincher</v>
<v Speaker 1>is known for dark central teams of</v>

6
00:00:25.471 --> 00:00:29.220
<v Speaker 1>mccarver firelands crime broken</v>
<v Speaker 1>psychology.</v>

7
00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:34.080
<v Speaker 1>His major characters range from</v>
<v Speaker 1>emotionally closed off to depressed and</v>

8
00:00:34.081 --> 00:00:37.420
<v Speaker 1>schizophrenia to complete psychopathic</v>
<v Speaker 1>serial killer.</v>

9
00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:42.600
<v Speaker 1>She begged for her life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She begged for her life set up and for</v>

10
00:00:42.601 --> 00:00:47.601
<v Speaker 1>the life of the baby inside of her.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Knowing this,</v>

11
00:00:49.630 --> 00:00:53.710
<v Speaker 1>I think it's easy to predict the social</v>
<v Speaker 1>network is not going to be your average</v>

12
00:00:53.740 --> 00:00:56.410
<v Speaker 1>run of the mill young struggling</v>
<v Speaker 1>entrepreneur success story.</v>

13
00:00:56.890 --> 00:01:00.460
<v Speaker 1>This already becomes clear in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>soundtrack during the opening credits.</v>

14
00:01:00.910 --> 00:01:04.640
<v Speaker 1>This piece of music that's returns</v>
<v Speaker 1>multiple times in the movie combines the</v>

15
00:01:04.641 --> 00:01:08.650
<v Speaker 1>saft piano tune in an uneasy tension</v>
<v Speaker 1>creating file in behind it.</v>

16
00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:13.090
<v Speaker 1>The score created by Trent reznor</v>
<v Speaker 1>already illustrates the major teams of</v>

17
00:01:13.091 --> 00:01:16.140
<v Speaker 1>the movie named Leah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>broken loneliness and a seating anger,</v>

18
00:01:16.150 --> 00:01:17.650
<v Speaker 1>a thirst for power underneath it.</v>

19
00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:26.880
<v Speaker 1>So the question is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what does the social network really</v>

20
00:01:26.881 --> 00:01:28.650
<v Speaker 1>about?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's get started.</v>

21
00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:33.480
<v Speaker 1>The narrative of the movie doesn't rely</v>
<v Speaker 1>so much on the creation of facebook to</v>

22
00:01:33.481 --> 00:01:36.660
<v Speaker 1>be a good story.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The central teams can also be found in</v>

23
00:01:36.661 --> 00:01:38.460
<v Speaker 1>many important stories throughout</v>
<v Speaker 1>history.</v>

24
00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:42.920
<v Speaker 1>It's the right off the film.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Aaron Sorkin says it's not a movie about</v>

25
00:01:42.921 --> 00:01:45.080
<v Speaker 1>facebook.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a movie set against the backdrop of</v>

26
00:01:45.081 --> 00:01:49.730
<v Speaker 1>facebook,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but really it's the themes and this move</v>

27
00:01:49.731 --> 00:01:51.470
<v Speaker 1>yours.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All the storytelling itself,</v>

28
00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:56.920
<v Speaker 1>the as he calls them Shakespearean teams</v>
<v Speaker 1>that and is talking about are things</v>

29
00:01:57.081 --> 00:01:58.010
<v Speaker 1>like power,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hunger,</v>

30
00:01:58.040 --> 00:02:00.220
<v Speaker 1>social class section,</v>
<v Speaker 1>love,</v>

31
00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:05.230
<v Speaker 1>friendship,</v>
<v Speaker 1>loyalty and betrayal only friend.</v>

32
00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:09.423
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

33
00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:17.060
<v Speaker 1>These teams are embedded in a plot that</v>
<v Speaker 1>focuses on the relationships that Mark</v>

34
00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:19.490
<v Speaker 1>Hass and destroys during the creation of</v>
<v Speaker 1>facebook.</v>

35
00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:22.340
<v Speaker 1>The narrative for stores from the</v>
<v Speaker 1>prospective of two hearings,</v>

36
00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:27.050
<v Speaker 1>one buyer market sued by his former best</v>
<v Speaker 1>friend and another where Marc sued by</v>

37
00:02:27.051 --> 00:02:30.500
<v Speaker 1>its competitors.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The opening act and all the seats that's</v>

38
00:02:30.501 --> 00:02:34.790
<v Speaker 1>folks on the creation of facebook are in</v>
<v Speaker 1>fact flashbacks solely ever feeling the</v>

39
00:02:34.791 --> 00:02:39.791
<v Speaker 1>reasons mark it suits for fucking over</v>
<v Speaker 1>as best friends potentially stealing the</v>

40
00:02:39.861 --> 00:02:43.810
<v Speaker 1>idea of facebook from this competition.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you see any of your code on facebook?</v>

41
00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:45.800
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I use any of your coke,</v>

42
00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:51.190
<v Speaker 1>she stole our whole Goddamn idea.</v>
<v Speaker 1>match.com for hiring and you know,</v>

43
00:02:51.951 --> 00:02:54.800
<v Speaker 1>you really don't need it forensics team</v>
<v Speaker 1>to get to the bottom of this and if you</v>

44
00:02:54.801 --> 00:02:58.670
<v Speaker 1>guys were the inventors of facebook ad</v>
<v Speaker 1>to Facebook,</v>

45
00:02:59.610 --> 00:03:03.570
<v Speaker 1>it is certainly true that the film's</v>
<v Speaker 1>plot can't stand on its own as a strong</v>

46
00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:06.070
<v Speaker 1>end entertaining story.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yet in my opinion,</v>

47
00:03:06.071 --> 00:03:09.760
<v Speaker 1>to see the creation of facebook and as</v>
<v Speaker 1>just the background of the story does</v>

48
00:03:09.761 --> 00:03:13.000
<v Speaker 1>not do the film justice.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Facebook as the biggest and most</v>

49
00:03:13.001 --> 00:03:16.520
<v Speaker 1>powerful social let's book in the world</v>
<v Speaker 1>is a fascinating subject for media</v>

50
00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:20.350
<v Speaker 1>scholars and a lot of questions and</v>
<v Speaker 1>critique and it's working.</v>

51
00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:23.020
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>found within the plot dialogue and</v>

52
00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:25.200
<v Speaker 1>especially the character's personality,</v>

53
00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:28.280
<v Speaker 2>you have part of my attention,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have a minimum amount.</v>

54
00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:31.730
<v Speaker 2>The rest of my attention is back at the</v>
<v Speaker 2>offices of facebook where my colleagues</v>

55
00:03:31.731 --> 00:03:34.550
<v Speaker 2>and I are doing things that no one in</v>
<v Speaker 2>this room including and especially your</v>

56
00:03:34.551 --> 00:03:37.130
<v Speaker 2>clients or intellectually or creatively</v>
<v Speaker 2>capable of doing.</v>

57
00:03:37.970 --> 00:03:40.460
<v Speaker 1>I want to look at this from a couple of</v>
<v Speaker 1>different perspectives,</v>

58
00:03:40.490 --> 00:03:44.540
<v Speaker 1>building it up and important,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but first I have to say many scholars</v>

59
00:03:44.541 --> 00:03:48.150
<v Speaker 1>have found positive aspects of facebook.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Since you know the nature of finches</v>

60
00:03:48.151 --> 00:03:50.470
<v Speaker 1>work,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we are mainly discussing critique on</v>

61
00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:52.970
<v Speaker 1>facebook,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which of course it's very important</v>

62
00:03:52.971 --> 00:03:55.520
<v Speaker 1>critique,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it does mean facebook is something</v>

63
00:03:55.521 --> 00:03:57.410
<v Speaker 1>evil that only as negative for</v>
<v Speaker 1>infection.</v>

64
00:03:57.440 --> 00:04:00.800
<v Speaker 1>Social life for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if facebook has had very positive</v>

65
00:04:00.801 --> 00:04:05.120
<v Speaker 1>effects on weak social ties,</v>
<v Speaker 1>meaning that week social relations such</v>

66
00:04:05.121 --> 00:04:08.080
<v Speaker 1>as holiday friends,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which are problematic because of this.</v>

67
00:04:08.100 --> 00:04:10.430
<v Speaker 1>This can stay active.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Thanks you facebook.</v>

68
00:04:10.730 --> 00:04:12.710
<v Speaker 1>Now back to the fields critique or</v>
<v Speaker 1>facebook.</v>

69
00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:16.820
<v Speaker 1>A major issue of the recent years is</v>
<v Speaker 1>incident Boudin and the nature of the</v>

70
00:04:16.821 --> 00:04:20.030
<v Speaker 1>comment sections,</v>
<v Speaker 1>discussions on social and political</v>

71
00:04:20.031 --> 00:04:23.780
<v Speaker 1>issues of quickly escalate right for</v>
<v Speaker 1>comments on mine for victims of</v>

72
00:04:23.781 --> 00:04:25.460
<v Speaker 1>bullying.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Often in high school,</v>

73
00:04:25.461 --> 00:04:29.980
<v Speaker 1>the bullying continues to facebook when</v>
<v Speaker 1>they come home and the social network,</v>

74
00:04:29.981 --> 00:04:34.330
<v Speaker 1>when mark gets broken up with he blocks</v>
<v Speaker 1>hatefully about his ex girlfriend when</v>

75
00:04:34.331 --> 00:04:37.360
<v Speaker 1>he tries to apologize.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She perfectly explains the nature of</v>

76
00:04:37.361 --> 00:04:39.370
<v Speaker 1>Internet bullying in a couple of lights.</v>

77
00:04:39.890 --> 00:04:41.600
<v Speaker 2>The Internet's not written in Pencil</v>
<v Speaker 2>mark.</v>

78
00:04:41.610 --> 00:04:45.990
<v Speaker 2>It's written in ink and you published an</v>
<v Speaker 2>eric all Brits and Bitch right before</v>

79
00:04:45.991 --> 00:04:48.570
<v Speaker 2>you made some ignorant crack about my</v>
<v Speaker 2>family's name,</v>

80
00:04:48.980 --> 00:04:51.330
<v Speaker 2>my bra size,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then graded women based on their</v>

81
00:04:51.331 --> 00:04:54.420
<v Speaker 2>hotness.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You write your snipe bullshit from a</v>

82
00:04:54.421 --> 00:04:57.300
<v Speaker 2>dark room because that's what the angry</v>
<v Speaker 2>do nowadays,</v>

83
00:04:58.870 --> 00:05:00.970
<v Speaker 1>June,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the beginning of the film off to Moscow</v>

84
00:05:00.971 --> 00:05:02.770
<v Speaker 1>from,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I'll put him in the opening scene.</v>

85
00:05:03.100 --> 00:05:06.690
<v Speaker 1>Mark also creates a website where you</v>
<v Speaker 1>can rank the university's girls in the</v>

86
00:05:06.691 --> 00:05:09.300
<v Speaker 1>hotness against each other.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The scene intercut,</v>

87
00:05:09.301 --> 00:05:13.750
<v Speaker 1>secretion and immediate popularity of</v>
<v Speaker 1>this website against a fraternity party</v>

88
00:05:13.751 --> 00:05:17.580
<v Speaker 1>where girls are brought in on a bus and</v>
<v Speaker 1>are clearly sexually objectified.</v>

89
00:05:18.310 --> 00:05:21.400
<v Speaker 1>This illustrates beautifully how the</v>
<v Speaker 1>sexual objectification of girls and</v>

90
00:05:21.401 --> 00:05:24.880
<v Speaker 1>college is digitalized,</v>
<v Speaker 1>creating a sort of power shift from the</v>

91
00:05:24.881 --> 00:05:27.550
<v Speaker 1>fraternity,</v>
<v Speaker 1>popular jocks to show called nerds.</v>

92
00:05:27.580 --> 00:05:30.250
<v Speaker 1>That's created the website at the end of</v>
<v Speaker 1>the scene.</v>

93
00:05:30.251 --> 00:05:32.800
<v Speaker 1>Even the jokes at the party are clicking</v>
<v Speaker 1>on the website.</v>

94
00:05:33.010 --> 00:05:37.000
<v Speaker 1>This is the key of the film's critiques.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's concentrating on the digitalization</v>

95
00:05:37.030 --> 00:05:40.900
<v Speaker 1>of the social experience of college,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not only in the front birds but also the</v>

96
00:05:40.901 --> 00:05:45.190
<v Speaker 1>hard parts such as social hierarchy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>exclusion and rejection</v>

97
00:05:47.370 --> 00:05:52.140
<v Speaker 2>and talking about taking the entire</v>
<v Speaker 2>social experience of college and putting</v>

98
00:05:52.141 --> 00:05:54.030
<v Speaker 2>it online.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can't feel my legs.</v>

99
00:05:54.150 --> 00:05:56.610
<v Speaker 2>I know I'm totally psyched about this</v>
<v Speaker 2>too,</v>

100
00:05:56.611 --> 00:05:57.770
<v Speaker 2>but pardot.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

101
00:05:58.190 --> 00:06:02.480
<v Speaker 1>it would be exclusive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>See in a world where social structure</v>

102
00:06:02.481 --> 00:06:05.870
<v Speaker 1>was everything,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that was the thing.</v>

103
00:06:06.110 --> 00:06:09.350
<v Speaker 1>This brings us back to the original</v>
<v Speaker 1>themes of sadness and anger in the</v>

104
00:06:09.351 --> 00:06:13.550
<v Speaker 1>opening credits soundtrack and we see</v>
<v Speaker 1>facebook as a digitalization of social</v>

105
00:06:13.551 --> 00:06:15.680
<v Speaker 1>life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We have to look at the social life of</v>

106
00:06:15.681 --> 00:06:18.620
<v Speaker 1>its creator already in the opening scene</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the film,</v>

107
00:06:18.621 --> 00:06:22.280
<v Speaker 1>much becomes clear about mark's</v>
<v Speaker 1>motivations is obsessed with getting</v>

108
00:06:22.281 --> 00:06:25.310
<v Speaker 1>into a final club because of the social</v>
<v Speaker 1>standing it would provide,</v>

109
00:06:25.910 --> 00:06:29.390
<v Speaker 1>but because of this he completely misses</v>
<v Speaker 1>out that his girlfriend is trying to</v>

110
00:06:29.391 --> 00:06:32.570
<v Speaker 1>have real conversation with him and he</v>
<v Speaker 1>has condescending to her social</v>

111
00:06:32.571 --> 00:06:33.050
<v Speaker 1>conditioning.</v>

112
00:06:33.050 --> 00:06:34.550
<v Speaker 2>You want to tell you that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think you might want to be a little</v>

113
00:06:34.551 --> 00:06:36.030
<v Speaker 2>more supportive.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I get in,</v>

114
00:06:36.260 --> 00:06:39.770
<v Speaker 2>I will be taking you to the events and</v>
<v Speaker 2>the gatherings and they'll be meeting a</v>

115
00:06:39.771 --> 00:06:41.000
<v Speaker 2>lot of people you wouldn't normally get</v>
<v Speaker 2>to</v>

116
00:06:43.260 --> 00:06:44.093
