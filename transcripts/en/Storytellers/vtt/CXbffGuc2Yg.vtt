1
00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:00.943
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2
00:00:04.190 --> 00:00:07.580
<v Speaker 2>inglorious bastards.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Due to my interest in water to in</v>

3
00:00:07.581 --> 00:00:10.040
<v Speaker 2>general,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's sporadic use of different</v>

4
00:00:10.041 --> 00:00:12.890
<v Speaker 2>languages,</v>
<v Speaker 2>rear end damage and bolts.</v>

5
00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:16.970
<v Speaker 2>Historic revisionism is my favorite</v>
<v Speaker 2>Tarantino film so far.</v>

6
00:00:17.360 --> 00:00:21.160
<v Speaker 2>It was to my surprise,</v>
<v Speaker 2>therefore that film only got a 69 mets</v>

7
00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:25.370
<v Speaker 2>score on MDB.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It turns out that 17 or diverting from</v>

8
00:00:25.371 --> 00:00:28.520
<v Speaker 2>history angered some critics.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Jonathan Rosenbaum,</v>

9
00:00:28.521 --> 00:00:31.400
<v Speaker 2>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>call to film deeply offensive and</v>

10
00:00:31.430 --> 00:00:34.910
<v Speaker 2>morally akin to Holocaust denial to dos</v>
<v Speaker 2>critics.</v>

11
00:00:34.911 --> 00:00:39.170
<v Speaker 2>The history of the Holocaust is simply</v>
<v Speaker 2>too serious for Cij revisionism,</v>

12
00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:43.010
<v Speaker 2>too serious for Terantin or style or</v>
<v Speaker 2>cinematic violence,</v>

13
00:00:43.011 --> 00:00:46.220
<v Speaker 2>which is violence of course,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as exciting over the top,</v>

14
00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:48.260
<v Speaker 2>spectacle or even comedy.</v>

15
00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:54.460
<v Speaker 1>Oh man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a shot in the face.</v>

16
00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:56.440
<v Speaker 1>Do you do that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't mean to do.</v>

17
00:00:56.441 --> 00:00:57.310
<v Speaker 1>It was an accident</v>

18
00:00:57.430 --> 00:00:59.940
<v Speaker 2>check.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Nutrients from now you see it argued</v>

19
00:00:59.950 --> 00:01:03.940
<v Speaker 2>that with inglorious pastors,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Tarantino makes fun of his audience by</v>

20
00:01:03.941 --> 00:01:08.170
<v Speaker 2>drawing a parallel between the way the</v>
<v Speaker 2>Nazis enjoyed the mindless violence and</v>

21
00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:12.190
<v Speaker 2>killing innovation sprite.</v>
<v Speaker 2>As we enjoyed the final instantly tino</v>

22
00:01:12.191 --> 00:01:15.010
<v Speaker 2>creates in his own film,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was arguing for dead.</v>

23
00:01:15.011 --> 00:01:19.090
<v Speaker 2>It is not quite as simple as that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>As some of the comments on now you see</v>

24
00:01:19.091 --> 00:01:22.900
<v Speaker 2>it's video Poland doubts Terentino's</v>
<v Speaker 2>criticizing his audience for liking</v>

25
00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:25.630
<v Speaker 2>violence would be the highest form of</v>
<v Speaker 2>hypocrisy.</v>

26
00:01:25.870 --> 00:01:30.790
<v Speaker 2>Terentino's pointed out multiple times</v>
<v Speaker 2>his law for cinematic violence as fun</v>

27
00:01:30.820 --> 00:01:35.620
<v Speaker 2>and entertaining spectacle I was argued</v>
<v Speaker 2>at with inglorious bastards.</v>

28
00:01:35.650 --> 00:01:39.460
<v Speaker 2>Tarantino not so much criticizes his</v>
<v Speaker 2>audience for Liking Violence,</v>

29
00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:44.540
<v Speaker 2>bit tune historical Lens Explorers and</v>
<v Speaker 2>reflects upon the cinematic violence and</v>

30
00:01:44.981 --> 00:01:48.610
<v Speaker 2>cinema as a whole.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Many critics have pointed towards the</v>

31
00:01:48.611 --> 00:01:52.600
<v Speaker 2>final scene of inglorious pastors as</v>
<v Speaker 2>Tarantino declaring the film is a</v>

32
00:01:52.620 --> 00:01:53.560
<v Speaker 2>masterpiece.</v>

33
00:01:57.250 --> 00:01:59.400
<v Speaker 1>My</v>
<v Speaker 1>next</v>

34
00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:03.300
<v Speaker 2>yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you look back in the film,</v>

35
00:02:03.301 --> 00:02:06.060
<v Speaker 2>he places himself in question and more</v>
<v Speaker 2>company</v>

36
00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:19.020
<v Speaker 2>when now you see it's comparison to</v>
<v Speaker 2>violence in a nation sprites to defiance</v>

37
00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:22.270
<v Speaker 2>of the bastards.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He fills to see important differences in</v>

38
00:02:22.271 --> 00:02:26.200
<v Speaker 2>their cinematic styles.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The Nazi film stills the nutshell or a</v>

39
00:02:26.201 --> 00:02:28.840
<v Speaker 2>nation sprites,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is featured in the climax of</v>

40
00:02:28.841 --> 00:02:33.841
<v Speaker 2>inglorious bastards is a parallel to</v>
<v Speaker 2>triomphe desk villains from Leni</v>

41
00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:35.920
<v Speaker 2>Riefenstahl,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who is mentioned multiple times in the</v>

42
00:02:35.921 --> 00:02:36.540
<v Speaker 2>movie,</v>

43
00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:41.540
<v Speaker 1>think it kind of getting you up</v>
<v Speaker 1>the</v>

44
00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:45.050
<v Speaker 2>violence in the nation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sprite is shults into fascist the</v>

45
00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:47.780
<v Speaker 2>headache.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Susan Sonntag also referring to</v>

46
00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:50.390
<v Speaker 2>Riefenstahl states that the fascist</v>
<v Speaker 2>aesthetic,</v>

47
00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:55.270
<v Speaker 2>our tales of longing for high places of</v>
<v Speaker 2>the men and Barf to Uber Manch while in</v>

48
00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:58.190
<v Speaker 2>the area and ideal that is placed above</v>
<v Speaker 2>all else.</v>

49
00:02:58.280 --> 00:03:02.380
<v Speaker 2>The boss is to the contrary,</v>
<v Speaker 2>represented multicultural collective of</v>

50
00:03:02.381 --> 00:03:05.560
<v Speaker 2>the American melting pots.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They come from different places and</v>

51
00:03:05.561 --> 00:03:09.790
<v Speaker 2>backgrounds and in their difference are</v>
<v Speaker 2>challenged to the area in aesthetic that</v>

52
00:03:09.791 --> 00:03:12.100
<v Speaker 2>Google's promotes in a nation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Surprise.</v>

53
00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:15.580
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the opening scene often pastorates is</v>

54
00:03:15.581 --> 00:03:19.900
<v Speaker 2>already a break with typical Tarantino</v>
<v Speaker 2>West cinematic violence.</v>

55
00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:21.820
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it is explosive birth.</v>

56
00:03:21.850 --> 00:03:26.770
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't function so much as spectacle</v>
<v Speaker 2>or comedy as Terentino's violence</v>

57
00:03:26.771 --> 00:03:30.400
<v Speaker 2>usually does.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Terentino's constructs the scene in such</v>

58
00:03:30.401 --> 00:03:35.401
<v Speaker 2>a way slowly building to Hans Landa,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that explosion of violence feels quite</v>

59
00:03:35.651 --> 00:03:39.910
<v Speaker 2>horrific and quite cruel.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Making this opening chapter feel more</v>

60
00:03:39.911 --> 00:03:43.690
<v Speaker 2>like a scene from a holocaust film than</v>
<v Speaker 2>Terentino's normal.</v>

61
00:03:43.691 --> 00:03:46.300
<v Speaker 2>Don't worry,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's only a movie kind of violence.</v>

62
00:03:48.770 --> 00:03:51.410
<v Speaker 2>Of course,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this isn't the case in the next chapter</v>

63
00:03:51.411 --> 00:03:56.330
<v Speaker 2>where we meet the bastards here,</v>
<v Speaker 2>violence is both spectacle and comedy.</v>

64
00:03:56.630 --> 00:04:01.090
<v Speaker 2>Although rain even directly mentioned</v>
<v Speaker 2>the link between cinema and violence as</v>

65
00:04:01.110 --> 00:04:04.730
<v Speaker 2>sources of entertainment,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to hear you say that,</v>

66
00:04:05.090 --> 00:04:06.950
<v Speaker 2>quite frankly,</v>
<v Speaker 2>close,</v>

67
00:04:07.170 --> 00:04:12.080
<v Speaker 2>we're getting going to the movies.</v>
<v Speaker 2>These first two chapters function in two</v>

68
00:04:12.081 --> 00:04:15.380
<v Speaker 2>ways.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Both teens are completely different in</v>

69
00:04:15.381 --> 00:04:19.430
<v Speaker 2>their tone and fuel and violence.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She had two scenes are also very much</v>

70
00:04:19.431 --> 00:04:22.790
<v Speaker 2>alike.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Both feature a commander that claims to</v>

71
00:04:22.791 --> 00:04:27.300
<v Speaker 2>have come down from the mountains to</v>
<v Speaker 2>take part in the war who is in control</v>

72
00:04:27.310 --> 00:04:31.670
<v Speaker 2>of the narrative and directs the scene</v>
<v Speaker 2>to watch its final conclusion.</v>

73
00:04:32.030 --> 00:04:36.590
<v Speaker 2>Yet the violence in the first chapter</v>
<v Speaker 2>feels cruel and horrific while in the</v>

74
00:04:36.591 --> 00:04:38.990
<v Speaker 2>second chapter at a spectacle and the</v>
<v Speaker 2>comedy,</v>

75
00:04:39.260 --> 00:04:41.930
<v Speaker 2>of course,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're in a culture we naturally and</v>

76
00:04:41.931 --> 00:04:45.920
<v Speaker 2>rightfully so route for the allies and</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not for the Nazis yet.</v>

77
00:04:46.200 --> 00:04:51.200
<v Speaker 2>Tino does hint that the officer who is</v>
<v Speaker 2>beaten to death is an honorable man.</v>

78
00:04:54.510 --> 00:04:55.343
<v Speaker 1>Juice.</v>

79
00:04:59.290 --> 00:05:02.950
<v Speaker 2>Tarantino deffer shows that through</v>
<v Speaker 2>cinematic techniques such as the</v>

80
00:05:02.951 --> 00:05:05.950
<v Speaker 2>soundtrack,</v>
<v Speaker 2>firelands can have two totally different</v>

81
00:05:05.951 --> 00:05:08.430
<v Speaker 2>functions into fairly similar scene.</v>

82
00:05:12.120 --> 00:05:16.560
<v Speaker 2>The second function is to make clear the</v>
<v Speaker 2>distinction between the Boston arts and</v>

83
00:05:16.561 --> 00:05:21.180
<v Speaker 2>Shoshana as characters.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Although most of the bosses are Jewish,</v>

84
00:05:21.210 --> 00:05:23.880
<v Speaker 2>they come from different places and</v>
<v Speaker 2>backgrounds.</v>

85
00:05:23.940 --> 00:05:28.380
<v Speaker 2>They are a multicultural ragtag group</v>
<v Speaker 2>that merged into a greater American</v>

86
00:05:28.381 --> 00:05:32.790
<v Speaker 2>whole with the goal to bring terror to</v>
<v Speaker 2>the Nazis were going to be doing one</v>

87
00:05:32.791 --> 00:05:37.260
<v Speaker 2>thing and one thing only.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Killing Nancy's Shoshana,</v>

88
00:05:37.340 --> 00:05:40.380
<v Speaker 2>however,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is defined by her identity as a Jewish</v>

89
00:05:40.381 --> 00:05:44.490
<v Speaker 2>victims of the Holocaust.</v>
<v Speaker 2>For awhile she adopts the identity of a</v>

90
00:05:44.491 --> 00:05:47.280
<v Speaker 2>French girl,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but she never forgets what happened to</v>

91
00:05:47.281 --> 00:05:51.330
<v Speaker 2>her and her family.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now the film builds towards a claim</v>

92
00:05:51.490 --> 00:05:56.400
<v Speaker 2>where boats have Shana and the Boston</v>
<v Speaker 2>execute a revenge plots on Hitler and</v>

93
00:05:56.440 --> 00:06:01.440
<v Speaker 2>Nazi Mount.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Both French plots together resulted in</v>

94
00:06:03.061 --> 00:06:07.350
<v Speaker 2>what seems to be a typical Terentino's</v>
<v Speaker 2>sheen over the top violence.</v>

95
00:06:07.410 --> 00:06:09.420
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they are affect different narrative</v>

96
00:06:09.421 --> 00:06:11.910
<v Speaker 2>conclusions that's compete with each</v>
<v Speaker 2>other.</v>

97
00:06:12.450 --> 00:06:16.680
<v Speaker 2>The Boston burst in shoot Hitler and</v>
<v Speaker 2>goebbels to bits and then blow up the</v>

98
00:06:16.681 --> 00:06:18.900
<v Speaker 2>whole theater,</v>
<v Speaker 2>including themselves.</v>

99
00:06:19.200 --> 00:06:20.820
<v Speaker 2>Domain boster.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's all the rain,</v>

100
00:06:20.821 --> 00:06:23.320
<v Speaker 2>however,</v>
<v Speaker 2>survives and Indians to Boston.</v>

101
00:06:23.321 --> 00:06:27.660
<v Speaker 2>It's narrative is one of the rugged</v>
<v Speaker 2>American cowboy that's rights into town,</v>

102
00:06:27.690 --> 00:06:31.950
<v Speaker 2>kills the ins against impossible odds</v>
<v Speaker 2>and writes outs round recently,</v>

103
00:06:35.310 --> 00:06:36.143
<v Speaker 1>scalper Herman</v>

104
00:06:38.090 --> 00:06:41.300
<v Speaker 2>through this Lens.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It is indeed very arguable that</v>

105
00:06:41.301 --> 00:06:45.920
<v Speaker 2>inglorious bastards to field licensed</v>
<v Speaker 2>the horror of the Holocaust and evils of</v>

106
00:06:45.921 --> 00:06:48.290
<v Speaker 2>the Nazi regime against the Jewish</v>
<v Speaker 2>people.</v>

107
00:06:48.590 --> 00:06:52.050
<v Speaker 2>However,</v>
<v Speaker 2>although the film ends with the Boston</v>

108
00:06:52.050 --> 00:06:53.840
<v Speaker 2>Shoshana's for your French still</v>
<v Speaker 2>lingers,</v>

109
00:06:53.930 --> 00:06:58.160
<v Speaker 2>which plays are darker and more</v>
<v Speaker 2>unsettling than that of the bastards</v>

110
00:07:08.490 --> 00:07:12.880
<v Speaker 2>who you French for Christ or own</v>
<v Speaker 2>extinction who refer plays out from</v>

111
00:07:12.881 --> 00:07:15.880
<v Speaker 2>beyond the grave,</v>
<v Speaker 2>while her image becomes embedded in</v>

112
00:07:15.881 --> 00:07:18.820
<v Speaker 2>smoke,</v>
<v Speaker 2>connecting it to otherwise referenced</v>

113
00:07:18.840 --> 00:07:23.840
<v Speaker 2>horrors off to concentration camps.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She rises from a moment of greatest</v>

114
00:07:24.191 --> 00:07:28.300
<v Speaker 2>vulnerability as Sheila is dying to</v>
<v Speaker 2>reach an ambivalent triumph,</v>

115
00:07:28.630 --> 00:07:33.460
<v Speaker 2>she has other to refer on the people who</v>
<v Speaker 2>murdered her family and countless</v>

116
00:07:33.461 --> 00:07:36.190
<v Speaker 2>others,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so for people gazing at them from the</v>

117
00:07:36.191 --> 00:07:41.191
<v Speaker 2>smoke and ashes of the very furnished,</v>
<v Speaker 2>constructed to destroyer s with the boss</v>

118

<v Speaker 2>stood staring.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Tino fulfills this revenge fantasy on</v>

119
00:07:44.591 --> 00:07:47.080
<v Speaker 2>the Nazis.</v>
<v Speaker 2>True Shushana's narrative.</v>

120
00:07:47.140 --> 00:07:52.140
<v Speaker 2>Yet her narrative is much more aware of</v>
<v Speaker 2>the Holocaust and Jewish suffering under</v>

121
00:07:52.511 --> 00:07:53.980
<v Speaker 2>the Nazis.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The film.</v>

122
00:07:53.981 --> 00:07:57.760

<v Speaker 2>who has effect guilty clearer?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Who does the audience see as the main</v>

124
00:08:01.751 --> 00:08:04.270
<v Speaker 2>drive for revenge?</v>

<v Speaker 2>that it was someone else,</v>
<v Speaker 2>someone in the smoke that by now it's</v>

128
00:08:15.041 --> 00:08:18.130
<v Speaker 2>dispersed to the winds who really killed</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hitler.</v>
