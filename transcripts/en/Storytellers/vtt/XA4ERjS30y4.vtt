<v Speaker 1>Director of Gamma Delta opens is 2001</v>
<v Speaker 1>film the Devil's backbone with the</v>

2
00:00:08.191 --> 00:00:13.191
<v Speaker 1>question [inaudible]</v>
<v Speaker 1>the tragedy in question here,</v>

3
00:00:15.871 --> 00:00:19.710
<v Speaker 1>referring to the gruesome murder of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>young orphan boy certainty in a</v>

4
00:00:19.711 --> 00:00:23.580
<v Speaker 1>subsequent haunting of the orphanage by</v>
<v Speaker 1>his restless ghost in search of</v>

5
00:00:23.581 --> 00:00:27.270
<v Speaker 1>recognition and justice,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what does El Toro himself a stated that</v>

6
00:00:27.271 --> 00:00:31.350
<v Speaker 1>drama that unfolds within the confines</v>
<v Speaker 1>of this isolated complex serves merely</v>

7
00:00:31.351 --> 00:00:34.550
<v Speaker 1>as a microcosm of the tragedy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>His question is really it</v>

8
00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:40.910
<v Speaker 1>and the war goes on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The Spanish civil war was a brutal</v>

9
00:00:40.911 --> 00:00:45.911
<v Speaker 1>conflict at gripped Spain bites throat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Between the years of 1946 and 1939 it</v>

10
00:00:46.521 --> 00:00:50.000
<v Speaker 1>was a war fought and countless places</v>
<v Speaker 1>spanning the entire country,</v>

11
00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:53.600
<v Speaker 1>a struggle between the fascist and</v>
<v Speaker 1>nationalist forces of soon to be</v>

12
00:00:53.601 --> 00:00:57.410
<v Speaker 1>dictator General Francisco Franco and</v>
<v Speaker 1>Republican forces,</v>

13
00:00:57.411 --> 00:01:00.050
<v Speaker 1>which consisted mainly of communists,</v>
<v Speaker 1>anarchists,</v>

14
00:01:00.051 --> 00:01:02.720
<v Speaker 1>and democratic loyalists of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>Republican government.</v>

15
00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:07.250
<v Speaker 1>When the sounds of war,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're finally silenced on the 1st of</v>

16
00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:09.120
<v Speaker 1>April,</v>
<v Speaker 1>1949 to Spanish felling as nationalists</v>

17
00:01:09.121 --> 00:01:12.950
<v Speaker 1>Flag Hung Victoria's into capitol of</v>
<v Speaker 1>Madrid and it would remain there until</v>

18
00:01:12.951 --> 00:01:14.960
<v Speaker 1>the fall of the regime with the death of</v>
<v Speaker 1>Franco.</v>

19
00:01:14.961 --> 00:01:19.820
<v Speaker 1>In 1975 more than half a million lives</v>
<v Speaker 1>would be lost in the killing around</v>

20
00:01:19.821 --> 00:01:24.380
<v Speaker 1>450,000 roughly to country numbers only</v>
<v Speaker 1>to be dwarfed by another word.</v>

21
00:01:24.381 --> 00:01:28.610
<v Speaker 1>I would start only five months later.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The Spanish civil war due to its limited</v>

22
00:01:28.611 --> 00:01:30.780
<v Speaker 1>scope and occurrence with the second</v>
<v Speaker 1>world war,</v>

23
00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:34.460
<v Speaker 1>would dare for quickly become but a side</v>
<v Speaker 1>note in the minds of the international</v>

24
00:01:34.461 --> 00:01:36.260
<v Speaker 1>community,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but more importantly,</v>

25
00:01:36.261 --> 00:01:39.860
<v Speaker 1>it was an event that due to it's</v>
<v Speaker 1>indescribable savage killing between</v>

26
00:01:39.861 --> 00:01:41.810
<v Speaker 1>former neighbors,</v>
<v Speaker 1>friends and family,</v>

27
00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:45.620
<v Speaker 1>the people of Spain would choose to</v>
<v Speaker 1>forget and they're a national memory and</v>

28
00:01:45.621 --> 00:01:48.860
<v Speaker 1>it was exactly this conscious form of</v>
<v Speaker 1>repression that broad director,</v>

29
00:01:48.861 --> 00:01:51.290
<v Speaker 1>Dan Eltoro Toro to state that the civil</v>
<v Speaker 1>war,</v>

30
00:01:51.291 --> 00:01:53.300
<v Speaker 1>which was never completely healed in</v>
<v Speaker 1>Spain,</v>

31
00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:57.890
<v Speaker 1>is it ghost anything pending as it goes</v>
<v Speaker 1>in recognizing the lingering presence of</v>

32
00:01:57.891 --> 00:02:02.030
<v Speaker 1>this national trauma and the dangers for</v>
<v Speaker 1>getting one's best Deltoro decided to</v>

33
00:02:02.031 --> 00:02:03.710
<v Speaker 1>dedicated free films,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do engage,</v>

34
00:02:03.711 --> 00:02:06.740
<v Speaker 1>explain and find meaning in this still</v>
<v Speaker 1>sensitive topic.</v>

35
00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:08.450
<v Speaker 1>The first one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as I've mentioned,</v>

36
00:02:08.451 --> 00:02:11.600
<v Speaker 1>is what he calls his first real film,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the devil's backbone.</v>

37
00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:15.410
<v Speaker 1>The second one would come out four years</v>
<v Speaker 1>later in the form of Pan's labyrinth,</v>

38
00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:18.560
<v Speaker 1>and the third one in the trilogy is to</v>
<v Speaker 1>this day still to be announced.</v>

39
00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:20.810
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's important to note that neither of</v>

40
00:02:20.811 --> 00:02:23.540
<v Speaker 1>these films are straightforward</v>
<v Speaker 1>historical war films.</v>

41
00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:27.580
<v Speaker 1>The Devil's backbone unfolding during</v>
<v Speaker 1>the latter stages of the war is a gothic</v>

42
00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:31.670
<v Speaker 1>ghost stories set in an orphanage about</v>
<v Speaker 1>to protagonists Carlos interacting with</v>

43
00:02:31.671 --> 00:02:35.150
<v Speaker 1>the ghost of the murdered some something</v>
<v Speaker 1>Pan's labyrinth found the other hand</v>

44
00:02:35.151 --> 00:02:39.380
<v Speaker 1>taking place in 1944 can be most</v>
<v Speaker 1>accurately described as the twisted</v>

45
00:02:39.381 --> 00:02:43.460
<v Speaker 1>fairy tale of the young Ophelia.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A girl who explores a fantastical world</v>

46
00:02:43.461 --> 00:02:48.020
<v Speaker 1>with the desire to return as a magical</v>
<v Speaker 1>Princess Peter Pan like eternal child of</v>

47
00:02:48.021 --> 00:02:51.500
<v Speaker 1>the underworld decide Christopher</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hartney deltoros decision to use to</v>

48
00:02:51.501 --> 00:02:55.280
<v Speaker 1>fantastical to say something profound</v>
<v Speaker 1>about historical makes sense.</v>

49
00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:59.120
<v Speaker 1>Both of these genre seth historically</v>
<v Speaker 1>been utilized to explore and engage</v>

50
00:02:59.290 --> 00:03:00.340
<v Speaker 1>chaos,</v>
<v Speaker 1>drama,</v>

51
00:03:00.341 --> 00:03:04.240
<v Speaker 1>and the repressed parts of a culture in</v>
<v Speaker 1>the collective minds of its citizens.</v>

52
00:03:04.510 --> 00:03:08.500
<v Speaker 1>In awards of young Ian Psychoanalyst,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Donald call check when human resources</v>

53
00:03:08.501 --> 00:03:12.520
<v Speaker 1>are on the available archetype or</v>
<v Speaker 1>resources will present themselves in the</v>

54
00:03:12.521 --> 00:03:15.010
<v Speaker 1>devil's backbone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Does is manifested through the looming</v>

55
00:03:15.011 --> 00:03:18.310
<v Speaker 1>presence of specters and first one being</v>
<v Speaker 1>the ghost of Sunday,</v>

56
00:03:18.490 --> 00:03:21.210
<v Speaker 1>an orphan boy murdered by the violin.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jacinto,</v>

57
00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:26.350
<v Speaker 1>the oldest orphan into complex is deaf,</v>
<v Speaker 1>go seemingly unrecognized by both the</v>

58
00:03:26.351 --> 00:03:29.200
<v Speaker 1>staff of the orphanage as well as the</v>
<v Speaker 1>altar boys living there.</v>

59
00:03:29.590 --> 00:03:33.580
<v Speaker 1>Kai May the only witness to the murder</v>
<v Speaker 1>has kept his mouth shut and any attempt</v>

60
00:03:33.581 --> 00:03:35.760
<v Speaker 1>to bring up Sunday's fate as quickly</v>
<v Speaker 1>shut down,</v>

61
00:03:36.210 --> 00:03:38.020
<v Speaker 1>chaotic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>

62
00:03:38.021 --> 00:03:41.590
<v Speaker 1>any mentioned of death or tragedy seems</v>
<v Speaker 1>to have been deemed inappropriate by the</v>

63
00:03:41.591 --> 00:03:43.600
<v Speaker 1>leaders of the orphanage.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Carlos,</v>

64
00:03:43.601 --> 00:03:46.990
<v Speaker 1>the protagonist of the story is never</v>
<v Speaker 1>told of the demise of his father on the</v>

65
00:03:46.991 --> 00:03:50.470
<v Speaker 1>front line and the other kids still seem</v>
<v Speaker 1>to be receiving letters from their</v>

66
00:03:50.471 --> 00:03:52.960
<v Speaker 1>parents.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Parents who haven't been alive since</v>

67
00:03:52.961 --> 00:03:54.850
<v Speaker 1>before.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The moment the boys respect to flee,</v>

68
00:03:54.851 --> 00:03:57.080
<v Speaker 1>set food on the desolate orphanage</v>
<v Speaker 1>grounds.</v>

69
00:03:59.970 --> 00:04:03.100
<v Speaker 1>The second spectrum of the film can then</v>
<v Speaker 1>be identified as the ongoing,</v>

70
00:04:03.101 --> 00:04:06.730
<v Speaker 1>yet physically epson civil war or in</v>
<v Speaker 1>more visual terms,</v>

71
00:04:06.731 --> 00:04:10.390
<v Speaker 1>the always lingering presence off the</v>
<v Speaker 1>unexploded bomb in the middle of the</v>

72
00:04:10.430 --> 00:04:13.420
<v Speaker 1>courtyard dropped on the same night of</v>
<v Speaker 1>something's death.</v>

73
00:04:13.450 --> 00:04:16.030
<v Speaker 1>The device become spiritually connected</v>
<v Speaker 1>to the boys,</v>

74
00:04:16.031 --> 00:04:18.850
<v Speaker 1>restless spirit and the looming presence</v>
<v Speaker 1>of sudden death.</v>

75
00:04:19.390 --> 00:04:23.530
<v Speaker 1>Both are physically debt and yet both</v>
<v Speaker 1>are shown to be alive on a fantastical</v>

76
00:04:23.531 --> 00:04:24.364
<v Speaker 1>level.</v>

77
00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:26.453
<v Speaker 2>Sure.</v>

78
00:04:30.130 --> 00:04:34.030
<v Speaker 1>Not Unlike to unresolved trauma of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>war are asking for recognition and</v>

79
00:04:34.031 --> 00:04:38.230
<v Speaker 1>guiding Carlos along the way in a search</v>
<v Speaker 1>to find answers by engaging with the</v>

80
00:04:38.231 --> 00:04:41.470
<v Speaker 1>specters as similar thing happens in</v>
<v Speaker 1>Pan's labyrinth,</v>

81
00:04:41.530 --> 00:04:45.280
<v Speaker 1>which a fairytale manifests itself in</v>
<v Speaker 1>the world of the younger Ophelia in</v>

82
00:04:45.281 --> 00:04:49.030
<v Speaker 1>order for her to make sense or for life</v>
<v Speaker 1>after the traumatic death of her father</v>

83
00:04:49.031 --> 00:04:53.050
<v Speaker 1>and his replacement by the fascist</v>
<v Speaker 1>captain vidal affiliate has been forced</v>

84
00:04:53.051 --> 00:04:55.240
<v Speaker 1>to leave for us.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It into a world in which to realm of the</v>

85
00:04:55.241 --> 00:04:58.420
<v Speaker 1>fantastical and in material have been</v>
<v Speaker 1>all but forgotten.</v>

86
00:05:01.270 --> 00:05:04.630
<v Speaker 1>We can see this in the affiliates</v>
<v Speaker 1>metaphorical till the magical rows of</v>

87
00:05:04.650 --> 00:05:08.620
<v Speaker 1>immortality sitting at the top of a</v>
<v Speaker 1>mountain and slowly wittering away.</v>

88
00:05:08.621 --> 00:05:10.810
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the people below with become too scared</v>

89
00:05:10.811 --> 00:05:14.740
<v Speaker 1>of the poisonous foreigns guarding it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think become obsessed with their fear</v>

90
00:05:14.741 --> 00:05:18.460
<v Speaker 1>of death and pain.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This mentality manifests itself all</v>

91
00:05:18.461 --> 00:05:20.980
<v Speaker 1>throughout the story,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's most evident than captain</v>

92
00:05:20.981 --> 00:05:23.680
<v Speaker 1>Verdell.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He places high value in all things</v>

93
00:05:23.681 --> 00:05:28.681
<v Speaker 1>material and orderly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but outright despises any story that</v>

94
00:05:29.171 --> 00:05:33.490
<v Speaker 1>doesn't align with his fascist ideology</v>
<v Speaker 1>or that isn't grounded in what he calls</v>

95
00:05:33.491 --> 00:05:38.491
<v Speaker 1>reality of the world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The reality that for Ophelia is buddy</v>

96
00:05:39.770 --> 00:05:43.360
<v Speaker 1>foreground for what lies underneath.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right at the start of the movie,</v>

97
00:05:43.361 --> 00:05:47.230
<v Speaker 1>we can already see that she notices</v>
<v Speaker 1>things that others don't pay attention</v>

98
00:05:47.231 --> 00:05:51.700
<v Speaker 1>to or are just unable to see a few les</v>
<v Speaker 1>replacing of the eye back into its</v>

99
00:05:51.701 --> 00:05:54.160
<v Speaker 1>proper place,</v>
<v Speaker 1>signifying the opening of a new</v>

100
00:05:54.161 --> 00:05:54.994
<v Speaker 1>dimension.</v>

101
00:05:55.120 --> 00:05:56.920
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll throw it goes out of his way to</v>

102
00:05:56.930 --> 00:06:01.700
<v Speaker 1>depict how Captain Fidel blinds is</v>
<v Speaker 1>victims time and again until he himself</v>

103
00:06:01.701 --> 00:06:05.480
<v Speaker 1>is blinded at the end of the film.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Metaphorically depicting that all of</v>

104
00:06:05.481 --> 00:06:09.020
<v Speaker 1>these characters that have been forced</v>
<v Speaker 1>to leave or unconsciously separated from</v>

105
00:06:09.021 --> 00:06:13.640
<v Speaker 1>the realm of the fantastical and it is</v>
<v Speaker 1>not unique to just pan's labyrinth in</v>

106
00:06:13.641 --> 00:06:15.680
<v Speaker 1>the devil's backbone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have the antagonist.</v>

107
00:06:15.681 --> 00:06:20.000
<v Speaker 1>Jacinto is also shown to be bloodshot</v>
<v Speaker 1>displaying his feelings of rage and lack</v>

108
00:06:20.001 --> 00:06:22.760
<v Speaker 1>of clairvoyance.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The world of the Dell and just Cynthia</v>

109
00:06:22.770 --> 00:06:27.770
<v Speaker 1>was one dominated by the material,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one that places rigid and often gri</v>

110
00:06:32.061 --> 00:06:36.050
<v Speaker 1>boundaries on what is accepted as the</v>
<v Speaker 1>story of the nation and of the culture</v>

111
00:06:36.380 --> 00:06:40.490
<v Speaker 1>contrasted by the limitless roundness</v>
<v Speaker 1>and colorfulness of the mythological</v>

112
00:06:40.491 --> 00:06:43.040
<v Speaker 1>world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It all story in particular as one</v>

113
00:06:43.041 --> 00:06:46.130
<v Speaker 1>dominated by time and is connected</v>
<v Speaker 1>obsession with death,</v>

114
00:06:46.430 --> 00:06:50.360
<v Speaker 1>always checking the watch his father</v>
<v Speaker 1>gave him and physically living in a room</v>

115
00:06:50.361 --> 00:06:52.610
<v Speaker 1>that reminds us of the insight of a</v>
<v Speaker 1>clock,</v>

116
00:06:52.940 --> 00:06:56.510
<v Speaker 1>giving him somewhat of a resemblance to</v>
<v Speaker 1>did time and death obsessed Captain Hook</v>

117
00:06:56.511 --> 00:07:00.680
<v Speaker 1>and Peter Benn is sole purpose in life</v>
<v Speaker 1>being to die and men on the battlefield</v>

118
00:07:00.681 --> 00:07:04.490
<v Speaker 1>like his father before him and to have a</v>
<v Speaker 1>son to do it all over again.</v>

119
00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:08.240
<v Speaker 1>He's so certain of his beliefs that he</v>
<v Speaker 1>can't even conceive of any other</v>

120
00:07:08.241 --> 00:07:13.241
<v Speaker 1>outcomes to countered his worldview.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Delta Rho device is fantastical worlds</v>

121
00:07:13.251 --> 00:07:17.780
<v Speaker 1>into a strictly masculine brotherly</v>
<v Speaker 1>story and a sisterly feminine one.</v>

122
00:07:18.170 --> 00:07:22.640
<v Speaker 1>Both can be seen as young in stories of</v>
<v Speaker 1>self maturation in absence of the proper</v>

123
00:07:22.641 --> 00:07:26.500
<v Speaker 1>archetypal parental guidance according</v>
<v Speaker 1>to professor Jordan B.</v>

124
00:07:26.500 --> 00:07:29.030
<v Speaker 1>Peterson is research into recurring</v>
<v Speaker 1>archetypal symbolism.</v>

125
00:07:29.031 --> 00:07:32.990
<v Speaker 1>We can distinguish between the great</v>
<v Speaker 1>fodder often representing a society's</v>

126
00:07:32.991 --> 00:07:37.250
<v Speaker 1>culture and order and the great mother</v>
<v Speaker 1>often representing the earth and the</v>

127
00:07:37.251 --> 00:07:41.150
<v Speaker 1>exploration of novelty.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Both these archetypes have a wise,</v>

128
00:07:41.190 --> 00:07:44.240
<v Speaker 1>benevolent side and a tyrannical</v>
<v Speaker 1>destructive side.</v>

129
00:07:44.750 --> 00:07:48.740
<v Speaker 1>Degrade moderate provides the hero with</v>
<v Speaker 1>the promise of a safe haven to fall back</v>

130
00:07:48.741 --> 00:07:51.530
<v Speaker 1>on s he or she makes the journey into</v>
<v Speaker 1>the unknown.</v>

131
00:07:51.890 --> 00:07:53.030
<v Speaker 1>Her opposite,</v>
<v Speaker 1>however,</v>

132
00:07:53.031 --> 00:07:57.260
<v Speaker 1>is over protective and always tries to</v>
<v Speaker 1>shield the protagonist from facing any</v>

133
00:07:57.261 --> 00:08:00.320
<v Speaker 1>adversity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The wise fodder or king on the other</v>

134
00:08:00.321 --> 00:08:03.950
<v Speaker 1>hand protects the protagonist,</v>
<v Speaker 1>instills confidence and encourages him</v>

135
00:08:03.951 --> 00:08:08.951
<v Speaker 1>or her to face the unknown and to take</v>
<v Speaker 1>self responsibility as an individual is</v>

136
00:08:09.231 --> 00:08:10.450
<v Speaker 1>tyrannical side,</v>
<v Speaker 1>however,</v>

137
00:08:10.460 --> 00:08:14.870
<v Speaker 1>consumes the individual through jealousy</v>
<v Speaker 1>and resentment in order to sustain his</v>

138
00:08:14.871 --> 00:08:15.704
<v Speaker 1>own power.</v>

139
00:08:15.980 --> 00:08:18.410
<v Speaker 1>This particular archetype reveals itself</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the field,</v>

140
00:08:18.411 --> 00:08:20.210
<v Speaker 1>yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>encountered with the pill men and</v>

141
00:08:20.240 --> 00:08:24.230
<v Speaker 1>ghastly humanoid creature who guards</v>
<v Speaker 1>eight lavish feast and consume some</v>

142
00:08:24.231 --> 00:08:27.950
<v Speaker 1>children who tried to eat from it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's throw himself as stated that the</v>

143
00:08:27.951 --> 00:08:31.490
<v Speaker 1>bill men represents the power hungry</v>
<v Speaker 1>fascism of Captain Verdell,</v>

144
00:08:31.700 --> 00:08:34.910
<v Speaker 1>the elder leaf,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Francesco Franco and the Spanish</v>

145
00:08:34.910 --> 00:08:38.570
<v Speaker 1>Catholic church also visually mirroring</v>
<v Speaker 1>the monster with these characters as</v>

146
00:08:38.571 --> 00:08:42.470
<v Speaker 1>they dine on a similar lavish feast.</v>
<v Speaker 1>On a more general level,</v>

147
00:08:42.471 --> 00:08:44.660
<v Speaker 1>however,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the creature represents the tyrannical</v>

148
00:08:44.661 --> 00:08:48.590
<v Speaker 1>nature of to tell Terry aneurysm as a</v>
<v Speaker 1>whole is del Toro shows us a pile of</v>

149
00:08:48.591 --> 00:08:52.220
<v Speaker 1>children's shoes echoing the last</v>
<v Speaker 1>generation of the Holocaust and the</v>

150
00:08:52.221 --> 00:08:54.710
<v Speaker 1>Second World War in the devil's</v>
<v Speaker 1>backbone.</v>

151
00:08:54.711 --> 00:08:58.860
<v Speaker 1>Jacinto functions as a similar diamond,</v>
<v Speaker 1>often shown in the same frame with the</v>

152
00:08:58.861 --> 00:09:00.930
<v Speaker 1>unexploded bomb.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He is seen beating,</v>

153
00:09:01.080 --> 00:09:03.630
<v Speaker 1>cutting,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and eventually even consciously mass</v>

154
00:09:03.631 --> 00:09:06.030
<v Speaker 1>murdering the other children in this</v>
<v Speaker 1>feelings of power,</v>

155
00:09:06.031 --> 00:09:07.590
<v Speaker 1>hungry,</v>
<v Speaker 1>rage and resentment,</v>

156
00:09:08.010 --> 00:09:10.830
<v Speaker 1>revealing that he has always been the</v>
<v Speaker 1>real ticking time bomb.</v>

157
00:09:11.250 --> 00:09:13.830
<v Speaker 1>On top of that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>his violent behavior has also shown to</v>

158
00:09:13.831 --> 00:09:15.900
<v Speaker 1>be rubbing off on the children around</v>
<v Speaker 1>him,</v>

159
00:09:16.170 --> 00:09:17.960
<v Speaker 1>which is depicted through to character</v>
<v Speaker 1>of crime.</v>

160
00:09:17.961 --> 00:09:21.750
<v Speaker 1>Me who mimics this destructive behavior</v>
<v Speaker 1>during the better first half of the</v>

161
00:09:21.751 --> 00:09:24.120
<v Speaker 1>film.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Even the orphanage itself seems to</v>

162
00:09:24.121 --> 00:09:27.510
<v Speaker 1>represent a place that consumes the</v>
<v Speaker 1>maturation of its children with its</v>

163
00:09:27.511 --> 00:09:30.240
<v Speaker 1>entrance mimicking a mouth eating.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The children who enter.</v>

164
00:09:30.560 --> 00:09:34.230
<v Speaker 1>They'll toro then seems to use this to</v>
<v Speaker 1>make a cautionary statement about the</v>

165
00:09:34.231 --> 00:09:36.810
<v Speaker 1>psychology behind the actions of us</v>
<v Speaker 1>antagonist.</v>

166
00:09:37.250 --> 00:09:41.100
<v Speaker 1>Jacinta will so first orphan to be</v>
<v Speaker 1>adopted by Carmen and doctor [inaudible]</v>

167
00:09:41.400 --> 00:09:43.890
<v Speaker 1>who would serve as his makeshift barents</v>
<v Speaker 1>of sorts.</v>

168
00:09:44.130 --> 00:09:46.320
<v Speaker 1>However,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a garment is seen engaging in a sort of</v>

169
00:09:46.350 --> 00:09:50.100
<v Speaker 1>oil depaul relationship with the boy and</v>
<v Speaker 1>the doctor confesses that he has never</v>

170
00:09:50.101 --> 00:09:55.101
<v Speaker 1>been fully dedicated to his tasks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>On top of that,</v>

171
00:09:58.081 --> 00:10:01.530
<v Speaker 1>Carmen is openly ashamed that the</v>
<v Speaker 1>relationship and mocks the boy for his</v>

172
00:10:01.531 --> 00:10:03.180
<v Speaker 1>lack of a fulfilled potential.</v>

173
00:10:10.910 --> 00:10:13.700
<v Speaker 1>It isn't perhaps no wonder that just</v>
<v Speaker 1>into stumped itself,</v>

174
00:10:13.701 --> 00:10:18.140
<v Speaker 1>grow for lack of a kingdom gave rise to</v>
<v Speaker 1>his feelings of rage and resentment that</v>

175
00:10:18.141 --> 00:10:21.020
<v Speaker 1>would fuel his desire to burn down as</v>
<v Speaker 1>shameful past.</v>

176
00:10:21.350 --> 00:10:24.440
<v Speaker 1>So besides serving as a means of dealing</v>
<v Speaker 1>with the press trauma,</v>

177
00:10:24.500 --> 00:10:29.000
<v Speaker 1>both Carlos and the Helios fantastical</v>
<v Speaker 1>journeys take on the role of cautionary</v>

178
00:10:29.001 --> 00:10:33.380
<v Speaker 1>archetypical tales of self maturation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Carlos in his friend's masculine journey</v>

179
00:10:33.381 --> 00:10:37.730
<v Speaker 1>is one of the development of unrelenting</v>
<v Speaker 1>courage to increasingly engaged with the</v>

180
00:10:37.731 --> 00:10:41.930
<v Speaker 1>repressed and the unknown.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Learning to take self responsibility and</v>

181
00:10:41.960 --> 00:10:46.110
<v Speaker 1>ultimately taking on the tyrant with the</v>
<v Speaker 1>help of lessons from history and a</v>

182
00:10:46.111 --> 00:10:49.030
<v Speaker 1>finally,</v>
<v Speaker 1>enlightened wise father affiliace</v>

183
00:10:49.050 --> 00:10:51.180
<v Speaker 1>journey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>on the other hand is a distinctly</v>

184
00:10:51.181 --> 00:10:53.460
<v Speaker 1>feminine one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or in the words of del Toro.</v>

185
00:10:53.670 --> 00:10:56.130
<v Speaker 1>And most of them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the fantasy world I think she wouldn't</v>

186
00:10:56.131 --> 00:10:58.530
<v Speaker 1>dream of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is really going back to the valley of</v>

187
00:10:58.531 --> 00:11:01.260
<v Speaker 1>her mother.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's the reason why she accesses</v>

188
00:11:01.261 --> 00:11:04.980
<v Speaker 1>the magical realm through her mother's</v>
<v Speaker 1>belly and why the film is littered with</v>

189
00:11:04.981 --> 00:11:09.981
<v Speaker 1>Fallopian imagery from the Fonz had to</v>
<v Speaker 1>to old thick tree to her bed frame.</v>

190
00:11:10.710 --> 00:11:14.070
<v Speaker 1>But in order for Ophelia to return to</v>
<v Speaker 1>the womb and become a princess,</v>

191
00:11:14.071 --> 00:11:18.660
<v Speaker 1>she has to show courage,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the fines towards absolute authority and</v>

192
00:11:18.661 --> 00:11:23.200
<v Speaker 1>most importantly on ultimate act of</v>
<v Speaker 1>selflessness and self sacrifice in</v>

193
00:11:23.201 --> 00:11:25.200
<v Speaker 1>servers off an uninvited siblings.</v>

194
00:11:27.300 --> 00:11:30.830
<v Speaker 1>So when a symbolical level,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ophelia has to prove herself to beat it,</v>

195
00:11:30.831 --> 00:11:34.170
<v Speaker 1>great mudder in order for her to be</v>
<v Speaker 1>reborn as to princess.</v>

196
00:11:34.380 --> 00:11:37.890
<v Speaker 1>But this doesn't mean that they'll toro</v>
<v Speaker 1>revises or sugarcoats history</v>

197
00:11:37.891 --> 00:11:39.420
<v Speaker 1>completely.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>

198
00:11:39.421 --> 00:11:43.740
<v Speaker 1>he actively seems to make a point out of</v>
<v Speaker 1>his trilogies opening question by using</v>

199
00:11:43.741 --> 00:11:47.310
<v Speaker 1>similar story setups,</v>
<v Speaker 1>mirroring certain previous events,</v>

200
00:11:47.311 --> 00:11:51.780
<v Speaker 1>and even using the same motivations and</v>
<v Speaker 1>outfits for similar characters.</v>

201
00:11:52.840 --> 00:11:57.840
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible] by the end of their journey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Carlos and his friends may have overcome</v>

202
00:12:00.581 --> 00:12:04.300
<v Speaker 1>the tyranny of Jacinto,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they leave the orphanage traumatized</v>

203
00:12:04.301 --> 00:12:07.570
<v Speaker 1>and physically scarred.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ultimately finding dare to Mys.</v>

204
00:12:07.571 --> 00:12:12.220
<v Speaker 1>Years later in Pan's labyrinth,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ophelia on her part is still shot and</v>

205
00:12:12.221 --> 00:12:14.590
<v Speaker 1>killed by Captain Verdell.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ironically,</v>

206
00:12:14.591 --> 00:12:17.350
<v Speaker 1>fulfilling her wish to remain a child</v>
<v Speaker 1>forever,</v>

207
00:12:17.680 --> 00:12:21.370
<v Speaker 1>but it's exactly in the selfless act of</v>
<v Speaker 1>protection that she makes room for an</v>

208
00:12:21.371 --> 00:12:25.690
<v Speaker 1>eventual better future by refusing to be</v>
<v Speaker 1>controlled by eight baffle logical</v>

209
00:12:25.691 --> 00:12:29.680
<v Speaker 1>ideology and by giving her brought her</v>
<v Speaker 1>to a generation that would eventually</v>

210
00:12:29.681 --> 00:12:33.850
<v Speaker 1>overthrown a fascist regime and who now</v>
<v Speaker 1>is both a foot in the material as well</v>

211
00:12:33.851 --> 00:12:37.390
<v Speaker 1>as the fantastical world,</v>
<v Speaker 1>his kingdom that was previously denied</v>

212
00:12:37.391 --> 00:12:38.224
<v Speaker 1>from Jacinto.</v>

213
00:12:38.360 --> 00:12:39.450
<v Speaker 3>Can you let me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Jane,</v>

214
00:12:46.240 --> 00:12:49.780
<v Speaker 1>it's true all of this that del Toro</v>
<v Speaker 1>ultimately expresses the power of the</v>

215
00:12:49.781 --> 00:12:53.770
<v Speaker 1>fantastical when the archetypal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>although his characters might be faded</v>

216
00:12:53.771 --> 00:12:57.460
<v Speaker 1>to remain kids forever,</v>
<v Speaker 1>their memories for God and repressed</v>

217
00:12:57.461 --> 00:13:01.870
<v Speaker 1>like the real life trauma of the Spanish</v>
<v Speaker 1>civil war and capsulated in time and</v>

218
00:13:01.871 --> 00:13:06.760
<v Speaker 1>nameless in their anonymity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's exactly in our engagement with</v>

219
00:13:06.761 --> 00:13:10.750
<v Speaker 1>these fantastical tragedies into</v>
<v Speaker 1>retailing and revival after archetypical</v>

220
00:13:10.751 --> 00:13:14.530
<v Speaker 1>symbolism that there are lessons skin</v>
<v Speaker 1>reemerge into our own lives,</v>

221
00:13:15.100 --> 00:13:19.450
<v Speaker 1>bead in the form of another famous</v>
<v Speaker 1>eternal child and his group of lost boys</v>

222
00:13:19.690 --> 00:13:23.710
<v Speaker 1>facing off against the time and death</v>
<v Speaker 1>obsessed captain hook or in the form of</v>

223
00:13:23.711 --> 00:13:27.880
<v Speaker 1>numerous gothic stories or in Delta</v>
<v Speaker 1>arose own fantastical worlds,</v>

224
00:13:28.210 --> 00:13:32.290
<v Speaker 1>worlds that are asking to be explored</v>
<v Speaker 1>that force us to be honest with</v>

225
00:13:32.291 --> 00:13:35.830
<v Speaker 1>ourselves and our reality.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you have the courage to confront</v>

226
00:13:35.831 --> 00:13:38.680
<v Speaker 1>that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What makes us uncomfortable to recognize</v>

227
00:13:38.681 --> 00:13:43.360
<v Speaker 1>the dangers and pitfalls along the way</v>
<v Speaker 1>whilst trying to navigate ourselves into</v>

232
00:14:01.251 --> 00:14:03.350

<v Speaker 1>opinion.</v>

233

<v Speaker 1>And making this video has only increased</v>
<v Speaker 1>my appreciation of these films.</v>
