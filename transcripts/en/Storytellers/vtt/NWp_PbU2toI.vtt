00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:23.833
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

6
00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:29.390
<v Speaker 1>Politics is no longer just theater.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's show business.</v>

7
00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:34.280
<v Speaker 1>So let's put on the best show in town.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One of the most defining aspects of</v>

8
00:00:34.281 --> 00:00:38.630
<v Speaker 1>house of cards is it's breaking of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>fourth wall inspired by Shakespeare's</v>

9
00:00:38.631 --> 00:00:39.770
<v Speaker 1>King Richard,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the third.</v>

10
00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:44.420
<v Speaker 1>Now he's the wind out of our discontent</v>
<v Speaker 1>made glorious summer.</v>

11
00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:49.070
<v Speaker 1>This method of directly addressing the</v>
<v Speaker 1>audience is very effective in pulling</v>

12
00:00:49.071 --> 00:00:52.680
<v Speaker 1>the audience closer towards the inner</v>
<v Speaker 1>thoughts and motivations of the main</v>

13
00:00:52.681 --> 00:00:54.770
<v Speaker 1>character.</v>
<v Speaker 1>For those of us climbing</v>

14
00:00:54.980 --> 00:00:58.010
<v Speaker 3>top of the food chain,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there can be no mercy.</v>

15
00:00:58.670 --> 00:01:03.020
<v Speaker 3>There is but one hunt or be hunted</v>

16
00:01:04.020 --> 00:01:06.920
<v Speaker 1>and house of cards.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This method is used to call Faye the</v>

17
00:01:06.921 --> 00:01:11.280
<v Speaker 1>dual polarity between frank underwood's</v>
<v Speaker 1>inner thoughts and his personality and</v>

18
00:01:11.281 --> 00:01:14.910
<v Speaker 1>his outwards behavior.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The image he constructs of himself.</v>

19
00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:19.360
<v Speaker 3>We have to hold this sticky fingers and</v>
<v Speaker 3>wipe the filthy mouth.</v>

20
00:01:20.150 --> 00:01:23.880
<v Speaker 3>Teach them right from wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Tell them what to sync and how to see</v>

21
00:01:23.881 --> 00:01:24.830
<v Speaker 3>you and what do we want.</v>

22
00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:29.280
<v Speaker 1>This is central to what makes the show</v>
<v Speaker 1>so successful as a hyper reps inflation</v>

23
00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:33.450
<v Speaker 1>or free or America politics as our</v>
<v Speaker 1>colleagues at waste cracker,</v>

24
00:01:33.451 --> 00:01:37.960
<v Speaker 1>if bonded hours to officials in house of</v>
<v Speaker 1>cards often focus on theater,</v>

25
00:01:37.961 --> 00:01:42.310
<v Speaker 1>aesthetics and art because this points</v>
<v Speaker 1>to the fundamental concepts that</v>

26
00:01:42.311 --> 00:01:46.120
<v Speaker 1>appearance drives politics.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Politics is performance.</v>

27
00:01:46.510 --> 00:01:51.010
<v Speaker 1>It is no coincidence that David fincher</v>
<v Speaker 1>is the executive producer and director</v>

28
00:01:51.011 --> 00:01:55.660
<v Speaker 1>of the first two episodes of the show.</v>
<v Speaker 1>His camera movements are always smooth,</v>

29
00:01:55.690 --> 00:01:57.850
<v Speaker 1>precise,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and in his own words,</v>

30
00:01:57.880 --> 00:02:01.420
<v Speaker 1>moving perfectly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A screen prison points out the color</v>

31
00:02:01.421 --> 00:02:04.630
<v Speaker 1>Palette of the show is dark,</v>
<v Speaker 1>representing the underworld that the</v>

32
00:02:04.631 --> 00:02:09.610
<v Speaker 1>underwoods move in and to cold blue and</v>
<v Speaker 1>warm yellow color contrasts represents</v>

33
00:02:09.611 --> 00:02:12.640
<v Speaker 1>the pool between human warmness and</v>
<v Speaker 1>Colton ambition.</v>

34
00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:17.230
<v Speaker 1>The composition is precise and set</v>
<v Speaker 1>designers thorough the way fincher</v>

35
00:02:17.231 --> 00:02:21.130
<v Speaker 1>carefully constructed images to look</v>
<v Speaker 1>perfectly stands parallel to the way</v>

36
00:02:21.131 --> 00:02:24.250
<v Speaker 1>frank and Claire Underwood Catholic</v>
<v Speaker 1>constructor own images,</v>

37
00:02:24.460 --> 00:02:25.450
<v Speaker 1>images,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of course,</v>

38
00:02:25.451 --> 00:02:28.230
<v Speaker 1>that height a darker reality.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's right.</v>

39
00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:36.360
<v Speaker 3>We don't submit the terror.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We make the terror.</v>

40
00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:46.920
<v Speaker 1>Politics as theater is a criticism of</v>
<v Speaker 1>many contemporary scholars on bill life,</v>

41
00:02:46.931 --> 00:02:51.931
<v Speaker 1>American politics just as to underwoods</v>
<v Speaker 1>image s carefully crafted and managed</v>

42
00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:53.650
<v Speaker 1>from Cuba.</v>

<v Speaker 1>live free or die</v>

44
00:02:59.420 --> 00:03:00.000
<v Speaker 4>two well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's</v>

45
00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:01.770
<v Speaker 1>kind of hairstyle or dress,</v>
<v Speaker 1>claire,</v>

46
00:03:01.771 --> 00:03:05.730
<v Speaker 1>where's the same is true for real life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>American politicians,</v>

47
00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:10.650
<v Speaker 1>so called establishment politicians on</v>
<v Speaker 1>both sides of the aisle tend to adopt</v>

48
00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:14.010
<v Speaker 1>few points that resonate with the</v>
<v Speaker 1>biggest part of that base.</v>

49
00:03:14.130 --> 00:03:16.270
<v Speaker 5>You were against same sex marriage.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Now your Ford,</v>

50
00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:18.720
<v Speaker 5>you defended President Obama's</v>
<v Speaker 5>immigration policies.</v>

51
00:03:18.740 --> 00:03:22.000
<v Speaker 5>Now you're saying they're too harsh.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He supported his trade deal dozens of</v>

52
00:03:22.001 --> 00:03:24.280
<v Speaker 5>times.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You can call it the gold standard now</v>

53
00:03:24.310 --> 00:03:27.570
<v Speaker 5>suddenly last week you're against it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>When you say anything to get elected,</v>

54
00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:32.360
<v Speaker 1>they carefully avoid any controversy and</v>
<v Speaker 1>use catch phrases and slogans instead of</v>

55
00:03:32.361 --> 00:03:35.690
<v Speaker 1>discussing nuance issues,</v>
<v Speaker 1>honestly and intellectually,</v>

56
00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:40.940
<v Speaker 2>but I've tried to figure out how we get</v>
<v Speaker 2>them to have pokemon go to the polls</v>

57
00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:47.570
<v Speaker 6>and we are going to make our country</v>
<v Speaker 6>great again.</v>

58
00:03:48.290 --> 00:03:52.580
<v Speaker 1>The appeal of house of cards lies in its</v>
<v Speaker 1>confirmation or for what we already</v>

59
00:03:52.581 --> 00:03:54.950
<v Speaker 1>suspect that it's behind the Catholic</v>
<v Speaker 1>cross.</v>

60
00:03:54.951 --> 00:03:58.040
<v Speaker 1>The facade or decent politics.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There is dishonesty,</v>

61
00:03:58.041 --> 00:03:59.390
<v Speaker 1>scheming,</v>
<v Speaker 1>blackmill,</v>

62
00:03:59.510 --> 00:04:00.770
<v Speaker 1>rootless power,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hunger,</v>

63
00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:04.820
<v Speaker 1>and maybe even criminality,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and this is the reason the audience</v>

64
00:04:04.821 --> 00:04:07.370
<v Speaker 1>roots,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially in the early seasons for it's</v>

65
00:04:07.371 --> 00:04:08.780
<v Speaker 1>immoral,</v>
<v Speaker 1>may character,</v>

66
00:04:08.810 --> 00:04:12.080
<v Speaker 1>frank underwood's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he participates in a theater of</v>

67
00:04:12.081 --> 00:04:14.780
<v Speaker 1>politics.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Birth only lets the viewers into the</v>

68
00:04:14.781 --> 00:04:18.010
<v Speaker 1>real truth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The fewer appreciates frank on the</v>

69
00:04:18.011 --> 00:04:20.210
<v Speaker 1>woods.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Authenticity in those moments of</v>

70
00:04:20.211 --> 00:04:22.460
<v Speaker 1>audience address,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even though it's authentic,</v>

71
00:04:22.461 --> 00:04:26.210
<v Speaker 1>self is deeply immoral.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The road to power is paved with them</v>

72
00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:32.800
<v Speaker 2>and casualties,</v>
<v Speaker 2>never,</v>

73
00:04:33.380 --> 00:04:34.213
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Correct.</v>

74
00:04:35.210 --> 00:04:39.500
<v Speaker 1>Because we disliked the hypocrisy off</v>
<v Speaker 1>this political theater so much.</v>

75
00:04:39.530 --> 00:04:42.470
<v Speaker 1>We love how frank uses it against</v>
<v Speaker 1>itself.</v>

76
00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:46.160
<v Speaker 1>It does becomes clear that people are</v>
<v Speaker 1>hef and moral honesty.</v>

77
00:04:46.220 --> 00:04:50.600
<v Speaker 1>Then moral dishonesty,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we simply detests hypocrisy or fake</v>

78
00:04:50.601 --> 00:04:54.450
<v Speaker 1>morality more than authentic wickedness.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It is here to us.</v>

79
00:04:54.451 --> 00:04:57.800
<v Speaker 1>We can make a comparison to real life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>American politics,</v>

80
00:04:57.830 --> 00:05:01.910
<v Speaker 1>frank and Claire on the woods career</v>
<v Speaker 1>politician power couple dynamic has</v>

81
00:05:01.911 --> 00:05:04.430
<v Speaker 1>often been compared to that of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>Clintons.</v>

82
00:05:04.640 --> 00:05:07.430
<v Speaker 1>Just as to underwoods.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The Clintons represent carefully</v>

83
00:05:07.431 --> 00:05:11.200
<v Speaker 1>constructed images and teared up</v>
<v Speaker 1>politics where the standpoints,</v>

84
00:05:11.270 --> 00:05:15.790
<v Speaker 1>they take change according to what is</v>
<v Speaker 1>most popular with the base and as the</v>

85
00:05:15.800 --> 00:05:19.310
<v Speaker 1>audience of house of cards like seeing</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Ari suspected power,</v>

86
00:05:19.311 --> 00:05:22.730
<v Speaker 1>hunger and corruption behind the facade</v>
<v Speaker 1>of theater and the show,</v>

87
00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:27.170
<v Speaker 1>it became increasingly clear the</v>
<v Speaker 1>citizens of the United States didn't</v>

88
00:05:27.171 --> 00:05:30.380
<v Speaker 1>trust the establishment.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Politicians like the Clintons anymore</v>

89
00:05:30.410 --> 00:05:34.190
<v Speaker 1>during the 2016 election and chose</v>
<v Speaker 1>something else.</v>

90
00:05:34.620 --> 00:05:37.290
<v Speaker 2>Sorry to keep you waiting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Complicated business</v>

91
00:05:38.720 --> 00:05:43.290
<v Speaker 1>raccoon praise that trump receives from</v>
<v Speaker 1>his fence is that at least he tells it</v>

92
00:05:43.291 --> 00:05:45.240
<v Speaker 1>like it is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It says it like it is,</v>

93
00:05:47.040 --> 00:05:50.370
<v Speaker 1>speaks to the truth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't mean if what he says is mean</v>

94
00:05:50.400 --> 00:05:53.330
<v Speaker 1>immoral or even to whether it's the</v>
<v Speaker 1>truth or not.</v>

95
00:05:53.340 --> 00:05:56.430
<v Speaker 1>I think he tells you the way he feels.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What matters is that he sees what he</v>

96
00:05:56.431 --> 00:06:00.620
<v Speaker 1>thinks filtering or changing his words</v>
<v Speaker 1>to protect this image.</v>

97
00:06:00.780 --> 00:06:04.950
<v Speaker 7>I see the political rhetoric.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Most of the politicians talk and let's</v>

98
00:06:04.951 --> 00:06:09.840
<v Speaker 7>say pastel colors.</v>
<v Speaker 7>They talk for two hours and you go away</v>

99
00:06:09.841 --> 00:06:10.860
<v Speaker 7>saying,</v>
<v Speaker 7>what did they say?</v>

100
00:06:10.861 --> 00:06:12.300
<v Speaker 7>If substance?</v>
<v Speaker 7>Probably nothing,</v>

101
00:06:12.600 --> 00:06:16.860
<v Speaker 7>but they haven't offended anybody and</v>
<v Speaker 7>tried to make everybody to that friend.</v>

102
00:06:17.430 --> 00:06:18.680
<v Speaker 7>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 7>if they're passed out,</v>

103
00:06:19.430 --> 00:06:23.670
<v Speaker 7>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 7>Donald Trump is vivid colors because he</v>

104
00:06:24.210 --> 00:06:25.340
<v Speaker 7>says things away.</v>
<v Speaker 7>They are</v>

105
00:06:25.470 --> 00:06:29.280
<v Speaker 1>some fall so far outside of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>political theater that's Clinton</v>

106
00:06:29.281 --> 00:06:33.480
<v Speaker 1>represents and to United States.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Citizens starts at tie off that he</v>

107
00:06:33.481 --> 00:06:34.510
<v Speaker 1>became electable.</v>

108
00:06:34.690 --> 00:06:39.190
<v Speaker 8>It's just awfully good that someone with</v>
<v Speaker 8>the temperament of Donald Trump is not</v>

109
00:06:39.191 --> 00:06:43.030
<v Speaker 8>in charge of the law in our country</v>
<v Speaker 8>because you'd be in jail.</v>

110
00:06:43.480 --> 00:06:46.880
<v Speaker 1>Since people will choose and moral</v>
<v Speaker 1>authenticity of both moral,</v>

111
00:06:46.881 --> 00:06:50.050
<v Speaker 1>a dishonesty,</v>
<v Speaker 1>are we always choosing between liars and</v>

112
00:06:50.051 --> 00:06:53.470
<v Speaker 1>crooks,</v>
<v Speaker 1>corrupt politicians and mean idiots?</v>

113
00:06:53.710 --> 00:06:56.590
<v Speaker 1>Is there a place in Washington for</v>
<v Speaker 1>authentic,</v>

114
00:06:56.620 --> 00:06:58.990
<v Speaker 1>idealistic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>honest politicians?</v>

115
00:06:59.500 --> 00:07:02.440
<v Speaker 8>Welcome to the death of the age of</v>
<v Speaker 8>reason?</v>

116
00:07:04.240 --> 00:07:08.170
<v Speaker 8>There is no right or wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Not Anymore.</v>

117
00:07:09.250 --> 00:07:14.200
<v Speaker 8>There's only being in</v>
<v Speaker 8>and then being out.</v>

118
00:07:15.510 --> 00:07:20.510
<v Speaker 1>Can we move beyond tita politics and</v>
<v Speaker 1>into real intellectual debate where we</v>

119
00:07:20.851 --> 00:07:24.120
<v Speaker 1>argue for our fuse,</v>
<v Speaker 1>both accept each other's differences?</v>

120
00:07:24.210 --> 00:07:29.210
<v Speaker 1>Can we move to genuine politics within</v>
<v Speaker 1>the chaos off the 2016 election?</v>

121
00:07:30.030 --> 00:07:32.400
<v Speaker 1>Hope for this appeared in a curious</v>
<v Speaker 1>form.</v>

122
00:07:32.850 --> 00:07:37.520
<v Speaker 1>Various intellectuals or differing</v>
<v Speaker 1>opinion are holding civilize debates</v>

123
00:07:37.620 --> 00:07:42.620
<v Speaker 1>where the RQ genuine authentic beliefs</v>
<v Speaker 1>without constructing or protecting the</v>

124
00:07:42.811 --> 00:07:46.020
<v Speaker 1>images while also still respecting the</v>
<v Speaker 1>other.</v>

125
00:07:46.380 --> 00:07:48.630
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>although they are gaining in popularity,</v>

126
00:07:48.631 --> 00:07:53.130
<v Speaker 1>the question remains if such politics is</v>
<v Speaker 1>possible on a nationwide level.</v>

127
00:07:53.250 --> 00:07:56.460
<v Speaker 1>Since authenticity also breeds</v>
<v Speaker 1>polarization,</v>

128
00:07:56.850 --> 00:08:01.850
<v Speaker 1>can authentic politics captured the</v>
<v Speaker 1>majority of the masters or are the worst</v>

129
00:08:02.071 --> 00:08:05.040
<v Speaker 1>sites or frank on the woods the best we</v>
<v Speaker 1>can do.</v>

130
00:08:09.340 --> 00:08:11.110
<v Speaker 1>All right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Thank you for watching everyone.</v>

131
00:08:11.140 --> 00:08:13.750
<v Speaker 1>I know this video might be pretty</v>
<v Speaker 1>polarizing,</v>

132
00:08:13.751 --> 00:08:18.100
<v Speaker 1>but I hope the common skin stay civil.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the past I've had a couple scares</v>

137
00:08:31.121 --> 00:08:33.820
<v Speaker 1>around my internet security.</v>
<v Speaker 1>For example,</v>

138
00:08:33.821 --> 00:08:38.650
<v Speaker 1>with my paypal being hex,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which forced me to having to cancel my</v>

139
00:08:38.651 --> 00:08:39.970
<v Speaker 1>credit cards.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

140
00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:44.650
<v Speaker 1>using a vpn or virtual private network</v>
<v Speaker 1>allows you to hide and protect your</v>

144
00:08:55.411 --> 00:08:59.970
<v Speaker 1>behind the simpleness not vpn uses</v>
<v Speaker 1>military grade encryption to connect you</v>

<v Speaker 1>government surveillance,</v>

148
00:09:11.461 --> 00:09:14.820
<v Speaker 1>which has long been a hotly debated</v>
<v Speaker 1>subject in the us,</v>

149
00:09:15.090 --> 00:09:19.620
<v Speaker 1>but now also the European Union passing</v>
