1
00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:09.420
<v Speaker 1>It's been five years since black water</v>
<v Speaker 1>originally aired and its explosion of</v>

2
00:00:09.421 --> 00:00:11.760
<v Speaker 1>wildfires,</v>
<v Speaker 1>still a sight to behold,</v>

3
00:00:12.790 --> 00:00:16.500
<v Speaker 1>but besides it's visual appeal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's in this moment through the death of</v>

4
00:00:16.501 --> 00:00:20.790
<v Speaker 1>hundreds in which the true nature of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>various characters involved are laid</v>

5
00:00:20.791 --> 00:00:23.640
<v Speaker 1>bare.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's these reactions they have and the</v>

6
00:00:23.641 --> 00:00:27.990
<v Speaker 1>decisions they make in the face of death</v>
<v Speaker 1>rather than the visual spectacle of war</v>

7
00:00:27.991 --> 00:00:31.710
<v Speaker 1>itself that makes this episode and game</v>
<v Speaker 1>of thrones as a whole,</v>

8
00:00:31.711 --> 00:00:34.530
<v Speaker 1>as great as it is now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>last season,</v>

9
00:00:34.531 --> 00:00:38.220
<v Speaker 1>we got to experience what it's like to</v>
<v Speaker 1>see another battle play out in this time</v>

10
00:00:38.221 --> 00:00:42.090
<v Speaker 1>on a much higher budget,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the battle of the bastards is in a</v>

11
00:00:42.091 --> 00:00:46.440
<v Speaker 1>lot of ways the opposite of black water.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The main focus here is on the visual</v>

12
00:00:46.470 --> 00:00:50.940
<v Speaker 1>rather than the moral and psychological.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's about the feeling of chaos for John</v>

13
00:00:50.941 --> 00:00:53.280
<v Speaker 1>and the horror of medieval warfare</v>
<v Speaker 1>itself.</v>

14
00:00:53.490 --> 00:00:54.420
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't get me wrong,</v>

15
00:00:54.421 --> 00:00:58.620
<v Speaker 1>it's a tremendous visual sequence that</v>
<v Speaker 1>dwarfs every battle previously seen on a</v>

16
00:00:58.621 --> 00:01:02.030
<v Speaker 1>show or TV in general for that matter,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's also sequenced.</v>

17
00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:05.100
<v Speaker 1>That's lacking in the aspects that make</v>
<v Speaker 1>game of thrones unique.</v>

18
00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:09.540
<v Speaker 1>The Battle of the best verses a struggle</v>
<v Speaker 1>between the forces of good and forces of</v>

19
00:01:09.541 --> 00:01:12.060
<v Speaker 1>evil,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whereas blackwater is a fight between</v>

20
00:01:12.061 --> 00:01:14.550
<v Speaker 1>two sites,</v>
<v Speaker 1>none of which are portrayed as being</v>

21
00:01:14.551 --> 00:01:18.750
<v Speaker 1>more benevolent or ill intention.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then the other nearby effectively</v>

22
00:01:18.751 --> 00:01:20.940
<v Speaker 1>confusing the audience and who to root</v>
<v Speaker 1>for.</v>

23
00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:25.680
<v Speaker 1>It's in this fog of war at writer George</v>
<v Speaker 1>Rr Martin has decided to depict the</v>

24
00:01:25.681 --> 00:01:28.080
<v Speaker 1>battle through the eyes of various</v>
<v Speaker 1>individuals,</v>

25
00:01:28.410 --> 00:01:32.340
<v Speaker 1>individuals from both sides who are all</v>
<v Speaker 1>dealing with the stress and the anxiety</v>

26
00:01:32.341 --> 00:01:35.520
<v Speaker 1>that comes with the reality of death and</v>
<v Speaker 1>their own particular way.</v>

27
00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:38.880
<v Speaker 1>We can see it in devils,</v>
<v Speaker 1>retaining his sense of level headed</v>

28
00:01:38.881 --> 00:01:43.650
<v Speaker 1>pragmatism and in the fanatical faith of</v>
<v Speaker 1>his son we received in Tyrian resorting</v>

29
00:01:43.651 --> 00:01:46.740
<v Speaker 1>to one last night of lovemaking and</v>
<v Speaker 1>accepting his fate.</v>

30
00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:51.210
<v Speaker 1>As a military commander,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we see it in prideful nihilism stenosis,</v>

31
00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:52.440
<v Speaker 1>content,</v>
<v Speaker 1>demeanor,</v>

32
00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:54.720
<v Speaker 1>bronze drinking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the hound cynicism.</v>

33
00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:57.380
<v Speaker 1>It's a show of character in the face of</v>
<v Speaker 1>death,</v>

34
00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:01.380
<v Speaker 1>a stripping away of all the</v>
<v Speaker 1>superficialities that normally shout the</v>

35
00:02:01.381 --> 00:02:04.020
<v Speaker 1>true essence of who these people truly</v>
<v Speaker 1>are.</v>

36
00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:06.070
<v Speaker 1>Don't get killed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

37
00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:07.400
<v Speaker 1>you my friend.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

38
00:02:08.170 --> 00:02:10.110
<v Speaker 1>are we friends now?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Of course we are,</v>

39
00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:12.050
<v Speaker 1>or as we'll showed her,</v>
<v Speaker 1>puts it well.</v>

40
00:02:12.051 --> 00:02:14.520
<v Speaker 1>It was expanding on the thoughts of</v>
<v Speaker 1>William Faulkner,</v>

41
00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:19.110
<v Speaker 1>the only thing or if writing about is</v>
<v Speaker 1>the human heart in conflict with itself.</v>

42
00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:22.680
<v Speaker 1>We all have it in us to be angels and</v>
<v Speaker 1>all of those have it in us to be</v>

43
00:02:22.681 --> 00:02:25.290
<v Speaker 1>monsters.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What matters is the decisions we make at</v>

44
00:02:25.291 --> 00:02:28.980
<v Speaker 1>two crucial periods and times of our</v>
<v Speaker 1>life and it's during the times when</v>

45
00:02:28.981 --> 00:02:30.550
<v Speaker 1>death,</v>
<v Speaker 1>disability stone's throw away,</v>

46
00:02:30.570 --> 00:02:35.400
<v Speaker 1>that our most authentic self will</v>
<v Speaker 1>consciously or unconsciously come to</v>

47
00:02:35.401 --> 00:02:40.401
<v Speaker 1>light</v>
<v Speaker 1>by placing the emphasis on the decisions</v>

48
00:02:41.101 --> 00:02:43.350
<v Speaker 1>and the mortality of individuals in</v>
<v Speaker 1>battle.</v>

49
00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:47.340
<v Speaker 1>Rather than framing this story in a more</v>
<v Speaker 1>conventional and simplistic good versus</v>

50
00:02:47.341 --> 00:02:50.250
<v Speaker 1>bad struggle.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It provides the audience for our very</v>

51
00:02:50.251 --> 00:02:53.970
<v Speaker 1>own conflict of heart as we're now</v>
<v Speaker 1>invited to seed our world in a more</v>

52
00:02:53.971 --> 00:02:58.140
<v Speaker 1>nuance and a more human manner,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no longer rooting for sides,</v>

53
00:02:58.141 --> 00:03:01.600
<v Speaker 1>for instead rooting for the individual,</v>
<v Speaker 1>empathizing with them,</v>

54
00:03:01.601 --> 00:03:04.570
<v Speaker 1>or at the very least,</v>
<v Speaker 1>truly learning something about their</v>

55
00:03:04.571 --> 00:03:06.340
<v Speaker 1>nature.</v>
<v Speaker 1>For King Joffrey,</v>

56
00:03:06.341 --> 00:03:10.540
<v Speaker 1>this means is show of cowardice or</v>
<v Speaker 1>perhaps also evidence of is harmful</v>

57
00:03:10.541 --> 00:03:15.010
<v Speaker 1>upbringing by a cynical mutter who</v>
<v Speaker 1>ultimately shows herself to be akin to</v>

58
00:03:15.011 --> 00:03:17.200
<v Speaker 1>the prideful destructiveness of real</v>
<v Speaker 1>life,</v>

59
00:03:17.230 --> 00:03:20.080
<v Speaker 1>mocked a goebbels,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but on the other hand we also get a</v>

60
00:03:20.081 --> 00:03:23.020
<v Speaker 1>sense of why it is that she became a</v>
<v Speaker 1>hateful person.</v>

61
00:03:23.021 --> 00:03:27.490
<v Speaker 1>She shows herself to be she drunkenly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>spouts out her resentments towards her</v>

62
00:03:27.491 --> 00:03:30.100
<v Speaker 1>father and her role as a woman in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>family.</v>

63
00:03:30.190 --> 00:03:35.190
<v Speaker 1>It was expected of me as it will be a</v>
<v Speaker 1>view if you ever become joffrey's queen,</v>

64
00:03:35.590 --> 00:03:39.020
<v Speaker 1>but in the midst of all the bickering</v>
<v Speaker 1>between main characters in the midst of</v>

65
00:03:39.110 --> 00:03:43.060
<v Speaker 1>our self reflection leadership and the</v>
<v Speaker 1>terminus in the face of the feet,</v>

66
00:03:43.450 --> 00:03:48.130
<v Speaker 1>George Rr Martin also doesn't forget to</v>
<v Speaker 1>show us the humanity on a larger skill</v>

67
00:03:48.370 --> 00:03:52.180
<v Speaker 1>and how the decisions of our high born</v>
<v Speaker 1>characters affect the lives of thousands</v>

68
00:03:52.181 --> 00:03:54.370
<v Speaker 1>otherwise,</v>
<v Speaker 1>nameless and forgotten people.</v>

69
00:03:54.510 --> 00:03:57.490
<v Speaker 2>The lab's called agreement to make,</v>
<v Speaker 2>trying to sneak away with a stolen horse</v>

70
00:03:57.491 --> 00:03:58.440
<v Speaker 2>and some gold cups.</v>

71
00:04:01.090 --> 00:04:05.140
<v Speaker 1>How's the NNC to them?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's through these brief glimpses in the</v>

72
00:04:05.141 --> 00:04:08.220
<v Speaker 1>background through shots of commoners</v>
<v Speaker 1>fleeing soldiers,</v>

73
00:04:08.250 --> 00:04:12.260
<v Speaker 1>vomiting before battle in a sense that</v>
<v Speaker 1>the good and the righteous only stands</v>

74
00:04:12.261 --> 00:04:16.320
<v Speaker 1>to lose in this war of kings.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Boys will never come back.</v>

75
00:04:17.180 --> 00:04:22.050
<v Speaker 1>Feel free will the west.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's about showing this that Martin</v>

76
00:04:22.051 --> 00:04:25.950
<v Speaker 1>personalizes and the generalized,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the conflict to the very bottom of the</v>

77
00:04:25.951 --> 00:04:28.500
<v Speaker 1>game of thrones hierarchy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Throughout the episode,</v>

78
00:04:28.501 --> 00:04:32.310
<v Speaker 1>Tyrian is the one character who truly</v>
<v Speaker 1>grasps the wider humanity at play,</v>

79
00:04:32.580 --> 00:04:36.730
<v Speaker 1>who understands the gap between the ones</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the high born and wants of those</v>

80
00:04:36.731 --> 00:04:37.710
<v Speaker 1>staking their order</v>

81
00:04:38.080 --> 00:04:41.150
<v Speaker 2>for your kids.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Don't fight for his kingdom.</v>

82
00:04:41.950 --> 00:04:45.310
<v Speaker 2>Your means the fact that your Katie's.</v>

83
00:04:46.140 --> 00:04:48.630
<v Speaker 1>It's only fitting that Syrian has been</v>
<v Speaker 1>known to be Martins,</v>

84
00:04:48.631 --> 00:04:52.500
<v Speaker 1>own embodiment of who he'd be or who he</v>
<v Speaker 1>wants to be in the world of game of</v>

85
00:04:52.501 --> 00:04:56.190
<v Speaker 1>chromes and it's complete deconstruction</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the US versus them narrative.</v>

86
00:04:56.220 --> 00:05:00.360
<v Speaker 1>Blackwater shows itself to be highly</v>
<v Speaker 1>critical of the feudal succession system</v>

87
00:05:00.361 --> 00:05:04.320
<v Speaker 1>and the senselessness of the conflict</v>
<v Speaker 1>being driven by people who send her</v>

88
00:05:04.460 --> 00:05:05.640
<v Speaker 1>again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>describes as,</v>

89
00:05:05.840 --> 00:05:10.100
<v Speaker 2>this is a killer.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Atlanta's just kill us,</v>

90
00:05:11.340 --> 00:05:12.180
<v Speaker 2>kill us.</v>

91
00:05:12.920 --> 00:05:16.100
<v Speaker 1>It's in this pessimistic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yet realistic view of the world of game,</v>

92
00:05:16.101 --> 00:05:19.670
<v Speaker 1>of thrones and fruit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a depiction of a truly great conflict in</v>

93
00:05:19.671 --> 00:05:23.600
<v Speaker 1>which good and bad exist on both sides</v>
<v Speaker 1>and inside the individual characters</v>

94
00:05:23.601 --> 00:05:25.880
<v Speaker 1>themselves,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the futility of it all becomes</v>

95
00:05:25.881 --> 00:05:30.170
<v Speaker 1>everclear and in which game of thrones</v>
<v Speaker 1>uniqueness truly shines as George</v>

96
00:05:30.171 --> 00:05:33.740
<v Speaker 1>himself puts it in response to the</v>
<v Speaker 1>battles likeness to deloitte or rings</v>

97
00:05:33.741 --> 00:05:37.410
<v Speaker 1>battle of Helm's deep.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The ward at Tolkien wrote about was war</v>

98
00:05:37.411 --> 00:05:40.040
<v Speaker 1>for the fate of civilization and the</v>
<v Speaker 1>future of humanity,</v>

99
00:05:40.280 --> 00:05:43.130
<v Speaker 1>and that's become the template.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not sure that's a good template</v>

100
00:05:43.131 --> 00:05:45.320
<v Speaker 1>though.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's all key model lead generations of</v>

101
00:05:45.321 --> 00:05:49.490
<v Speaker 1>fantasy writers to produce these endless</v>
<v Speaker 1>series of dark Lord Cinder Evil Minions</v>

102
00:05:49.491 --> 00:05:51.800
<v Speaker 1>who were all very ugly and wear black</v>
<v Speaker 1>clothes,</v>

103
00:05:52.220 --> 00:05:55.280
<v Speaker 1>but the vast majority of wars throughout</v>
<v Speaker 1>history are not like that.</v>

104
00:05:55.370 --> 00:05:57.620
<v Speaker 1>Although structurally very similar its</v>
<v Speaker 1>core,</v>

105
00:05:57.621 --> 00:06:02.150
<v Speaker 1>a black water can really be seen as a</v>
<v Speaker 1>sort of anti helm's deep and whereas the</v>

106
00:06:02.151 --> 00:06:05.780
<v Speaker 1>battle of the bastards might be a</v>
<v Speaker 1>different type of battle in its essence,</v>

107
00:06:05.781 --> 00:06:09.320
<v Speaker 1>it has a lot more in common with helm's</v>
<v Speaker 1>deep and it's all keen template in</v>

108
00:06:09.321 --> 00:06:13.610
<v Speaker 1>general being an outlier and for some</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe a breath of fresh air.</v>

109
00:06:13.610 --> 00:06:16.070
<v Speaker 1>There's really nothing wrong with this</v>
<v Speaker 1>in itself,</v>

110
00:06:16.490 --> 00:06:18.650
<v Speaker 1>but it seems that the final two seasons</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the show,</v>

111
00:06:18.651 --> 00:06:22.700
<v Speaker 1>we'll perhaps somewhat unavoidably move</v>
<v Speaker 1>ever more into the direction of</v>

112
00:06:22.701 --> 00:06:26.190
<v Speaker 1>conventional talking fantasy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But before we get there though,</v>

113
00:06:26.210 --> 00:06:29.150
<v Speaker 1>there are still battles to be fought</v>
<v Speaker 1>which could and shoot.</v>

114
00:06:29.151 --> 00:06:32.150
<v Speaker 1>Bring out what makes game of thrones</v>
<v Speaker 1>great in the first place.</v>

115
