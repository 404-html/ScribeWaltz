1
00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:05.310
<v Speaker 1>I told you and have it applied.</v>

2
00:00:06.910 --> 00:00:07.743
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

3
00:00:08.810 --> 00:00:12.620
<v Speaker 1>I think the first time I watched rick</v>
<v Speaker 1>reunite with Ilsa was during one of my</v>

4
00:00:12.621 --> 00:00:16.880
<v Speaker 1>film classes in College Larson.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have watched a great many old films</v>

5
00:00:16.881 --> 00:00:19.880
<v Speaker 1>during those lectures.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Most of which I think both of us don't</v>

6
00:00:19.881 --> 00:00:23.360
<v Speaker 1>really remember that well is we had the</v>
<v Speaker 1>tendency to doze off and those</v>

7
00:00:23.361 --> 00:00:26.420
<v Speaker 1>comfortable sit in my seats.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was until Cassa blank.</v>

8
00:00:26.421 --> 00:00:30.330
<v Speaker 1>I came around and managed to firmly</v>
<v Speaker 1>break that cycle of it's quick witted</v>

9
00:00:30.360 --> 00:00:35.360
<v Speaker 1>dialogue</v>
<v Speaker 1>and sambal memorable characters and of</v>

10
00:00:37.341 --> 00:00:38.510
<v Speaker 1>course it's music.</v>

11
00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:42.410
<v Speaker 2>Ooh,</v>

12
00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:46.280
<v Speaker 1>the most of all is the film's overall</v>
<v Speaker 1>story that makes her such an enjoyable</v>

13
00:00:46.281 --> 00:00:51.140
<v Speaker 1>viewing experience and it was only after</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'd read Robert McKee aptly named book</v>

14
00:00:51.141 --> 00:00:54.430
<v Speaker 1>story that I fully came to understand</v>
<v Speaker 1>why kiss a blank.</v>

15
00:00:54.431 --> 00:00:58.010
<v Speaker 1>I can be seen as a sort of gold standard</v>
<v Speaker 1>for great storytelling.</v>

16
00:00:58.340 --> 00:01:01.340
<v Speaker 1>Soon this video,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'd like to deviate from our usual</v>

17
00:01:01.341 --> 00:01:05.660
<v Speaker 1>format and provide you a more practical</v>
<v Speaker 1>look into the realm of storytelling as a</v>

18
00:01:05.661 --> 00:01:06.980
<v Speaker 1>whole.</v>
<v Speaker 1>To do this.</v>

19
00:01:06.981 --> 00:01:10.340
<v Speaker 1>I'll guide you through and Mickey's</v>
<v Speaker 1>guidelines for scene analysis and we'll</v>

20
00:01:10.341 --> 00:01:12.900
<v Speaker 1>take an in depth look and one of gas</v>
<v Speaker 1>blankets.</v>

21
00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:15.200
<v Speaker 1>Most pivotal scenes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's</v>

22
00:01:21.510 --> 00:01:24.210
<v Speaker 1>not a scene that I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>once you analyze its guests of Blanco's</v>

23
00:01:24.211 --> 00:01:27.590
<v Speaker 1>midair climax,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is being set up right here as rick</v>

24
00:01:27.591 --> 00:01:29.660
<v Speaker 1>spots.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It'll saw walking around to market,</v>

25
00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:32.990
<v Speaker 1>but before we get into that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we first need to answer the following</v>

26
00:01:32.991 --> 00:01:33.710
<v Speaker 1>question.</v>

27
00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:36.380
<v Speaker 1>What makes a scene work?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Some might say it,</v>

28
00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:40.490
<v Speaker 1>it's good dialogue or nice visuals and</v>
<v Speaker 1>although these things definitely help</v>

29
00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:43.820
<v Speaker 1>when key notes to the determining factor</v>
<v Speaker 1>lies within the subjects.</v>

30
00:01:43.821 --> 00:01:45.800
<v Speaker 1>Then the underlying structure of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>scene.</v>

31
00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:49.700
<v Speaker 1>Now what does this mean within scenes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we can make the distinction between</v>

32
00:01:49.701 --> 00:01:52.460
<v Speaker 1>texts,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sensory service off the image or an auto</v>

33
00:01:52.461 --> 00:01:54.420
<v Speaker 1>words.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everything that we see and here on</v>

34
00:01:54.421 --> 00:01:57.650
<v Speaker 1>screen and subutex,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which are all defaults,</v>

35
00:01:57.651 --> 00:02:00.680
<v Speaker 1>feelings and conscious as well as</v>
<v Speaker 1>unconscious desires.</v>

36
00:02:00.681 --> 00:02:02.860
<v Speaker 1>If the characters on screen and not a</v>
<v Speaker 1>words,</v>

37
00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:06.890
<v Speaker 1>everything that is unseen or actively</v>
<v Speaker 1>being veiled behind the sensory surfers</v>

38
00:02:06.891 --> 00:02:11.891
<v Speaker 1>of the text.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If characters lack multiple layers,</v>

39
00:02:19.051 --> 00:02:22.230
<v Speaker 1>they tend to feel bland,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which causes them to feel fake and</v>

40
00:02:22.231 --> 00:02:25.650
<v Speaker 1>dialogue to suffer as a consequence</v>
<v Speaker 1>which take a look at the segment from</v>

41
00:02:25.651 --> 00:02:26.484
<v Speaker 1>bill harbor.</v>

42
00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:31.150
<v Speaker 2>It's your nose.</v>

43
00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:38.050
<v Speaker 1>What has happened here is that the</v>
<v Speaker 1>subtext has been written directly into</v>

44
00:02:38.051 --> 00:02:40.660
<v Speaker 1>the text,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is commonly known as writing on</v>

45
00:02:40.661 --> 00:02:42.310
<v Speaker 1>the nose.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Good films,</v>

46
00:02:42.311 --> 00:02:44.650
<v Speaker 1>on the other hand,</v>
<v Speaker 1>generally have derek characters express</v>

47
00:02:44.651 --> 00:02:49.330
<v Speaker 1>themselves through subtext seems move</v>
<v Speaker 1>because conscious and unconscious</v>

48
00:02:49.331 --> 00:02:52.540
<v Speaker 1>desires clash.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's writers continuously up the</v>

49
00:02:52.541 --> 00:02:55.870
<v Speaker 1>stakes and with dark characters on the</v>
<v Speaker 1>spot because they know it's the</v>

50
00:02:55.871 --> 00:02:59.830
<v Speaker 1>decisions they make,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the actions they take that tell us more</v>

51
00:02:59.831 --> 00:03:03.800
<v Speaker 1>about a character then any piece of</v>
<v Speaker 1>surface level dialogue ever could just</v>

52
00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:05.330
<v Speaker 1>try them too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You</v>

53
00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:07.960
<v Speaker 3>not so fast,</v>
<v Speaker 3>lilly,</v>

54
00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:10.770
<v Speaker 3>nobody is going to be arrested,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not for a while yet.</v>

55
00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:14.190
<v Speaker 1>Now that we've covered that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's go back to the mid at climax and</v>

56
00:03:14.191 --> 00:03:18.000
<v Speaker 1>analyze how it gets a blank.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I use subutex to move to seeing forward.</v>

57
00:03:18.570 --> 00:03:22.260
<v Speaker 1>The first two things that we want to do</v>
<v Speaker 1>is one defined a conflict at the scene</v>

58
00:03:22.261 --> 00:03:25.440
<v Speaker 1>and to note the opening value.</v>
<v Speaker 1>To do this.</v>

59
00:03:25.441 --> 00:03:28.080
<v Speaker 1>We will need to briefly cover the</v>
<v Speaker 1>context of the scene.</v>

60
00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:30.830
<v Speaker 1>So for those of you are already very</v>
<v Speaker 1>familiar with the movie,</v>

61
00:03:30.831 --> 00:03:34.470
<v Speaker 1>you feel free to skip ahead.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Rick Blaine is a former freedom fighter</v>

62
00:03:34.471 --> 00:03:38.060
<v Speaker 1>turned saloon owner and castle blank,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or during the Second World War as</v>

63
00:03:38.090 --> 00:03:41.970
<v Speaker 1>cynical nature's revealed early on to be</v>
<v Speaker 1>caused by a devastating heartbreak he</v>

64
00:03:41.971 --> 00:03:46.860
<v Speaker 1>experienced the year earlier in Paris,</v>
<v Speaker 1>his goal friend and soon to be wife Ilsa</v>

65
00:03:46.860 --> 00:03:49.050
<v Speaker 1>Lund abandoned him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Today you were supposed to escape the</v>

66
00:03:49.051 --> 00:03:52.860
<v Speaker 1>city from the Nazis together.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fast forward a year and a to run into</v>

67
00:03:52.861 --> 00:03:54.840
<v Speaker 1>each other by coincidence and rick's</v>
<v Speaker 1>bar,</v>

68
00:03:55.020 --> 00:03:55.770
<v Speaker 1>it'll sound,</v>
<v Speaker 1>however,</v>

69
00:03:55.770 --> 00:03:57.990
<v Speaker 1>is not come alone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And during the late nine meetup,</v>

70
00:03:57.991 --> 00:04:00.230
<v Speaker 1>rick drunkenly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he calls her out for being a horror as</v>

71
00:04:00.240 --> 00:04:01.530
<v Speaker 1>she attempts to explain herself.</v>

72
00:04:01.670 --> 00:04:04.760
<v Speaker 3>Tell me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what did you left me?</v>

73
00:04:06.190 --> 00:04:11.190
<v Speaker 3>Lazlo are there others in between?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Aren't you the kind of tell</v>

74
00:04:11.450 --> 00:04:14.540
<v Speaker 1>after which you angrily barges out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which takes us back to the market scene.</v>

75
00:04:14.750 --> 00:04:17.900
<v Speaker 1>So did define the conflict.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We need to note the desires of the main</v>

76
00:04:17.901 --> 00:04:21.140
<v Speaker 1>characters and play.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Rick initiated the Seton and despite his</v>

77
00:04:21.141 --> 00:04:25.070
<v Speaker 1>inner resentment,</v>
<v Speaker 1>has goal is clear to when sub back her</v>

78
00:04:25.071 --> 00:04:27.200
<v Speaker 1>motivations on the other hand aren't</v>
<v Speaker 1>clear yet,</v>

79
00:04:27.230 --> 00:04:31.190
<v Speaker 1>but they're encounter tonight before</v>
<v Speaker 1>plus her guarded attitude right now give</v>

80
00:04:31.191 --> 00:04:33.170
<v Speaker 1>away to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she has an active interest in keeping</v>

81
00:04:33.171 --> 00:04:36.980
<v Speaker 1>her affair with rick in the past.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The opening value of the scene is love</v>

82
00:04:37.310 --> 00:04:40.730
<v Speaker 1>else's relationship to victor.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Laszlo has not been made clear yet,</v>

83
00:04:40.731 --> 00:04:43.970
<v Speaker 1>so rick sees an opportunity to reunite</v>
<v Speaker 1>with his former lover.</v>

84
00:04:44.170 --> 00:04:47.330
<v Speaker 1>The value is there for a positive,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which brings us to the first step.</v>

85
00:04:47.420 --> 00:04:51.050
<v Speaker 1>Breaking the scene and two beats.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now beat is an exchange of action</v>

86
00:04:51.051 --> 00:04:55.790
<v Speaker 1>reaction in character behavior both on a</v>
<v Speaker 1>textual as well and more importantly on</v>

87
00:04:55.791 --> 00:04:58.490
<v Speaker 1>a subtextual level.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So let's see if we can mark all the</v>

88
00:04:58.491 --> 00:04:59.390
<v Speaker 1>beats in this scene.</v>

89
00:04:59.820 --> 00:05:04.050
<v Speaker 3>You will not find a trade like this in</v>
<v Speaker 3>only 700 francs.</v>

90
00:05:04.140 --> 00:05:07.220
<v Speaker 1>The first one is established right here</v>
<v Speaker 1>before either rick or hills.</v>

91
00:05:07.221 --> 00:05:10.860
<v Speaker 1>I have even uttered a single word.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Rick's action is to approach her.</v>

92
00:05:10.920 --> 00:05:12.030
<v Speaker 1>It was a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>on the other hand,</v>

93
00:05:12.031 --> 00:05:14.160
<v Speaker 1>sensing his presence,</v>
<v Speaker 1>chooses to ignore him,</v>

94
00:05:15.310 --> 00:05:16.143
<v Speaker 3>cheated</v>

95
00:05:17.590 --> 00:05:21.490
<v Speaker 1>rick opens by protecting her from the</v>
<v Speaker 1>salesman and are now acknowledges his</v>

96
00:05:21.491 --> 00:05:24.280
<v Speaker 1>existence but chooses to reject his</v>
<v Speaker 1>advances.</v>

97
00:05:24.340 --> 00:05:27.010
<v Speaker 1>Rick's Voris who,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whoever seem to hint that more heals us</v>

98
00:05:27.011 --> 00:05:28.450
<v Speaker 1>relationship with Laszlo.</v>

99
00:05:28.680 --> 00:05:32.130
<v Speaker 3>Hi there ladies kinds of weeks.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We have a small discount.</v>

100
00:05:32.310 --> 00:05:36.180
<v Speaker 3>Did I say 700 francs?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can have a 200 I'm sorry I was in no</v>

101
00:05:36.181 --> 00:05:38.430
<v Speaker 3>condition to receive you when you called</v>
<v Speaker 3>on me last night.</v>

102
00:05:38.570 --> 00:05:39.520
<v Speaker 3>It doesn't matter.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

103
00:05:39.530 --> 00:05:43.530
<v Speaker 3>no special friends Albany cause we have</v>
<v Speaker 3>a special discount of 100 flags.</v>

104
00:05:43.800 --> 00:05:46.820
<v Speaker 1>Brick now tries to hide his</v>
<v Speaker 1>embarrassment by using excessive for</v>

105
00:05:46.821 --> 00:05:50.510
<v Speaker 1>melody to apologize for his behavior,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it also remains unimpressed.</v>

106
00:05:50.670 --> 00:05:54.010
<v Speaker 3>The story had me a little confused.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Maybe it was a boy bourbon.</v>

107
00:05:54.100 --> 00:05:56.940
<v Speaker 3>I have some table called some neck pain.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm really not.</v>

108
00:05:57.020 --> 00:05:58.190
<v Speaker 3>Please one minute please.</v>

109
00:05:58.270 --> 00:06:01.570
<v Speaker 1>Still attempting to open up the</v>
<v Speaker 1>conversation he moves to excuse making,</v>

110
00:06:01.571 --> 00:06:04.120
<v Speaker 1>but yet again hills or we'll have none</v>
<v Speaker 1>of it yet.</v>

111
00:06:04.121 --> 00:06:07.390
<v Speaker 1>She doesn't choose to leave.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Also notice how the role of the salesman</v>

112
00:06:07.391 --> 00:06:11.230
<v Speaker 1>is not really at all about comically</v>
<v Speaker 1>selling his lace to Ilsa,</v>

113
00:06:11.290 --> 00:06:13.450
<v Speaker 1>but rather about selling rick to Elsa.</v>

114
00:06:14.320 --> 00:06:17.440
<v Speaker 3>Why did you come back to tell me why you</v>
<v Speaker 3>ran out on me at the railway station?</v>

115
00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:18.833
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>

116
00:06:19.140 --> 00:06:22.380
<v Speaker 1>Rick desperately tries to get his foot</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the door by asking her a question</v>

117
00:06:22.381 --> 00:06:25.020
<v Speaker 1>that provides his own answer and it</v>
<v Speaker 1>works.</v>

118
00:06:25.070 --> 00:06:26.910
<v Speaker 1>It was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that opens up just a tiny bit.</v>

119
00:06:27.280 --> 00:06:28.390
<v Speaker 3>I do.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can tell me now.</v>

120
00:06:28.391 --> 00:06:31.080
<v Speaker 3>I'm reasonably showgirls.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't think I will rick</v>

121
00:06:31.320 --> 00:06:33.150
<v Speaker 1>by insulting them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Rick is at this point,</v>

122
00:06:33.151 --> 00:06:37.590
<v Speaker 1>essentially begging tools are in his own</v>
<v Speaker 1>way where she's no longer rejecting him</v>

123
00:06:37.591 --> 00:06:40.200
<v Speaker 1>completely,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but opposing him and asking for more.</v>

124
00:06:40.850 --> 00:06:42.320
<v Speaker 3>Why not?</v>
<v Speaker 3>After all that got stuck with the</v>

125
00:06:42.321 --> 00:06:45.980
<v Speaker 3>railway ticket,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think I'm entitled to know last night</v>

126
00:06:45.981 --> 00:06:49.400
<v Speaker 3>I saw what has happened to you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the rain can you in Paris?</v>

127
00:06:49.401 --> 00:06:52.910
<v Speaker 3>I could tell him he don't understand at</v>
<v Speaker 3>the one who looked at me with such</v>

128
00:06:52.911 --> 00:06:53.744
<v Speaker 3>hatred,</v>

129
00:06:53.790 --> 00:06:57.090
<v Speaker 1>rick losing his patient slightly moves</v>
<v Speaker 1>to guilt tripping ill zones to be an</v>

130
00:06:57.091 --> 00:06:58.910
<v Speaker 1>explanation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But both parties feel like dare to</v>

131
00:06:58.920 --> 00:07:00.630
<v Speaker 1>victims.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it'll say guilt trips,</v>

132
00:07:00.631 --> 00:07:01.470
<v Speaker 1>rick right back.</v>

133
00:07:04.010 --> 00:07:06.640
<v Speaker 3>How believing Casablanca soon and we'll</v>
<v Speaker 3>never see each other again.</v>

134
00:07:08.170 --> 00:07:10.900
<v Speaker 3>We knew very little about each other</v>
<v Speaker 3>when we were in love in Paris.</v>

135
00:07:12.580 --> 00:07:14.860
<v Speaker 3>We'll leave it that way.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Maybe we'll remember those days.</v>

136
00:07:14.861 --> 00:07:18.430
<v Speaker 3>Not Casablanca,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not last night.</v>

137
00:07:19.490 --> 00:07:22.490
<v Speaker 1>Ilsa now takes over to the initiative by</v>
<v Speaker 1>trying to see her goodbye to rick,</v>

138
00:07:22.580 --> 00:07:26.030
<v Speaker 1>who then completely refuses to react and</v>
<v Speaker 1>instead starts to next beat.</v>

139
00:07:26.220 --> 00:07:28.990
<v Speaker 3>Did you run out me because you couldn't</v>
<v Speaker 3>take it because you knew what it would</v>

140
00:07:28.991 --> 00:07:31.990
<v Speaker 3>be like hiding from the police running</v>
<v Speaker 3>away all the time.</v>

141
00:07:32.830 --> 00:07:34.110
<v Speaker 3>It can believe that if you want to.</v>

142
00:07:34.340 --> 00:07:37.370
<v Speaker 1>So now he decides to hit her with his</v>
<v Speaker 1>best guests for an extra nation by</v>

143
00:07:37.371 --> 00:07:40.490
<v Speaker 1>calling her a coward.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Those are no cysts to be false.</v>

144
00:07:40.491 --> 00:07:43.550
<v Speaker 1>So she insults him,</v>
<v Speaker 1>ride back by basically calling him a</v>

145
00:07:43.551 --> 00:07:44.210
<v Speaker 1>fool.</v>

146
00:07:44.210 --> 00:07:45.980
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not running away anymore.</v>

147
00:07:45.981 --> 00:07:48.290
<v Speaker 3>I'm settled now above us alone.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's true.</v>

148
00:07:48.291 --> 00:07:51.810
<v Speaker 3>But the walk up a flight,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'll be expecting you.</v>

149
00:07:54.360 --> 00:07:57.780
<v Speaker 1>The spider continuous denials,</v>
<v Speaker 1>rick sends us her true feelings in</v>

150
00:07:57.781 --> 00:08:01.980
<v Speaker 1>sexually propositions for two facts and</v>
<v Speaker 1>she tries to hide her blush on her hat</v>

151
00:08:01.981 --> 00:08:04.580
<v Speaker 1>brim.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Rick now feels like she's almost within</v>

152
00:08:04.620 --> 00:08:05.453
<v Speaker 1>his reach,</v>

153
00:08:05.670 --> 00:08:08.040
<v Speaker 3>all the same.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Someday you'll lie the Laszlo,</v>

154
00:08:08.580 --> 00:08:12.210
<v Speaker 3>you'll be there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

155
00:08:14.400 --> 00:08:17.820
<v Speaker 3>no.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You say Victor Laszlo is my husband and</v>

156
00:08:17.821 --> 00:08:20.040
<v Speaker 3>was even when I knew you in Paris.</v>

157
00:08:20.590 --> 00:08:22.720
<v Speaker 1>But again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>rick can contain his pain and calls her</v>

158
00:08:22.721 --> 00:08:25.870
<v Speaker 1>out for being a whore.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was a haven't been called a slut for</v>

159
00:08:25.871 --> 00:08:28.520
<v Speaker 1>the second time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Reaches for the one thing she knows who</v>

160
00:08:28.521 --> 00:08:31.600
<v Speaker 1>will hit the hardest because the</v>
<v Speaker 1>revelation that she'd always been</v>

161
00:08:31.601 --> 00:08:35.110
<v Speaker 1>married to Laszlo would imply that she</v>
<v Speaker 1>just used rick for her own pleasure in</v>

162
00:08:35.111 --> 00:08:38.110
<v Speaker 1>Paris and that our love had never been</v>
<v Speaker 1>real all along.</v>

163
00:08:38.560 --> 00:08:40.690
<v Speaker 1>However,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the subtext of the scene gives away to</v>

164
00:08:40.691 --> 00:08:43.990
<v Speaker 1>quite the opposite is the truth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But of course rick doesn't know that yet</v>

165
00:08:43.991 --> 00:08:46.360
<v Speaker 1>and was left devastated as Ilsa walks</v>
<v Speaker 1>off.</v>

166
00:08:47.590 --> 00:08:51.520
<v Speaker 1>So at the end of the scene to hopeful</v>
<v Speaker 1>positive opening value has changed into</v>

167
00:08:51.521 --> 00:08:54.580
<v Speaker 1>a deep and dark negative.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the final step of our analysis,</v>

168
00:08:54.581 --> 00:08:57.810
<v Speaker 1>we can see how to writers of guests a</v>
<v Speaker 1>blank and I've built a rapid progression</v>

169
00:08:57.811 --> 00:09:00.810
<v Speaker 1>of beets,</v>
<v Speaker 1>each placing in governing value of love</v>

170
00:09:00.811 --> 00:09:04.320
<v Speaker 1>at greater risk,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the 11 beat marks to climax and turning</v>

171
00:09:04.321 --> 00:09:07.830
<v Speaker 1>point of the scene after which the</v>
<v Speaker 1>opening value changes to its closing</v>

172
00:09:07.831 --> 00:09:08.520
<v Speaker 1>value.</v>

173
00:09:08.520 --> 00:09:11.130
<v Speaker 1>Of course the scene is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but a minor part in the massive full</v>

174
00:09:11.131 --> 00:09:15.300
<v Speaker 1>piece of writing that is Casablanca has</v>
<v Speaker 1>basically every scene in a movie as</v>

175
00:09:15.301 --> 00:09:18.390
<v Speaker 1>great if not greater than the one we</v>
<v Speaker 1>just analyze.</v>

176
00:09:18.660 --> 00:09:22.290
<v Speaker 1>But it goes to show how much attention</v>
<v Speaker 1>to scene structure and subutex has gone</v>

177
00:09:22.291 --> 00:09:24.570
<v Speaker 1>into the film.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And by having explored that,</v>

178
00:09:24.571 --> 00:09:29.310
<v Speaker 1>I hope to shed a light minor as it may</v>
<v Speaker 1>be on a craft of screenwriting as a</v>

179
00:09:29.311 --> 00:09:32.010
<v Speaker 1>whole.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because even though your scripts like</v>

180
00:09:32.011 --> 00:09:34.230
<v Speaker 1>Casablanca mine of a surface level</v>
<v Speaker 1>story,</v>

181
00:09:34.231 --> 00:09:37.680
<v Speaker 1>that's as Corny as they come.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If the writing is good and if the</v>

182
00:09:37.681 --> 00:09:41.310
<v Speaker 1>emotions are real and if the scenes</v>
<v Speaker 1>aren't what they seem to be about,</v>

183
00:09:41.580 --> 00:09:44.040
<v Speaker 1>you might just have something special in</v>
<v Speaker 1>your hands</v>

184
00:09:45.540 --> 00:09:46.780
<v Speaker 2>looking at you kid.</v>

185
00:09:55.210 --> 00:09:56.890
<v Speaker 1>All right guys,</v>
<v Speaker 1>thanks for watching.</v>

186
00:09:56.891 --> 00:10:00.400
<v Speaker 1>So obviously this video is quite</v>
<v Speaker 1>different from what we usually do and</v>

187
00:10:00.401 --> 00:10:03.460
<v Speaker 1>it's something that I've been wanting to</v>
<v Speaker 1>make since we first started the channel.</v>

188
00:10:03.760 --> 00:10:07.060
<v Speaker 1>I just felt like it didn't really have</v>
<v Speaker 1>the editing capabilities to pull off</v>

189
00:10:07.090 --> 00:10:08.950
<v Speaker 1>just yet,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so it tells if you'd like.</v>

190
00:10:08.951 --> 00:10:12.400
<v Speaker 1>These types of our practical slash</v>
<v Speaker 1>informative video is in between her</v>

191
00:10:12.430 --> 00:10:14.920
<v Speaker 1>regular analysis and we'll be sure to</v>
<v Speaker 1>make more of them.</v>

192
00:10:15.340 --> 00:10:18.280
<v Speaker 1>Also if you like what we do and one more</v>
<v Speaker 1>check at our patrion page where we</v>

193
00:10:18.281 --> 00:10:22.990
<v Speaker 1>produce additional content and followers</v>
<v Speaker 1>on social media and all that good stuff.</v>

194
00:10:23.110 --> 00:10:24.940
<v Speaker 1>Also,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one more thing if my voice sounds a</v>

195
00:10:24.941 --> 00:10:28.210
<v Speaker 1>little off in this one towards the end</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's because I got a little sick during</v>

196
00:10:28.211 --> 00:10:31.300
<v Speaker 1>the production of this video,</v>
<v Speaker 1>have recently moved halfway across the</v>

197
00:10:31.301 --> 00:10:33.220
<v Speaker 1>globe,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so that probably has something to do</v>

198
00:10:33.221 --> 00:10:34.330
<v Speaker 1>with it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Anyways,</v>

199
00:10:34.331 --> 00:10:36.790
<v Speaker 1>I think that wraps things up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Thanks again for watching and see you</v>

200
00:10:36.791 --> 00:10:37.450
<v Speaker 1>all the next one.</v>
