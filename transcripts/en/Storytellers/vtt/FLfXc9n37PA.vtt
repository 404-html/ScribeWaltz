00:00:00.070 --> 00:00:03.380
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure that you've heard that a plane</v>
<v Speaker 1>crashed and Coil Berry</v>

2
00:00:06.110 --> 00:00:06.943
<v Speaker 1>kill</v>

3
00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:20.090
<v Speaker 2>early 21st century</v>

4
00:00:21.010 --> 00:00:22.980
<v Speaker 3>today,</v>
<v Speaker 3>our fellow citizens,</v>

5
00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:28.110
<v Speaker 3>our way of life,</v>
<v Speaker 3>our very freedom came under attack in a</v>

6
00:00:28.111 --> 00:00:31.500
<v Speaker 3>series of deliberate and deadly</v>
<v Speaker 3>terrorist acts.</v>

7
00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:35.100
<v Speaker 3>The attacks on nine 11 not only shook up</v>
<v Speaker 3>in nation,</v>

8
00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:39.150
<v Speaker 3>but they woke the entire world from a</v>
<v Speaker 3>decade of relative tranquility.</v>

9
00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:43.500
<v Speaker 3>After the end of the Cold War,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the data towers fell would mark the</v>

10
00:00:43.501 --> 00:00:46.920
<v Speaker 3>beginning of a political scientist,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Samuel Huntington coin,</v>

11
00:00:47.220 --> 00:00:50.850
<v Speaker 3>the clash of civilizations,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the West versus the rest.</v>

12
00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:54.000
<v Speaker 3>Now what are you resonate with?</v>
<v Speaker 3>This concept is up to you,</v>

13
00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:59.480
<v Speaker 3>but he most certainly did.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Either you're with us where you are with</v>

14
00:01:00.061 --> 00:01:00.960
<v Speaker 3>the terrorists</v>

15
00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:06.080
<v Speaker 4>and in the war against terror.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's this frame of mind that will</v>

16
00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:10.130
<v Speaker 4>reaffirm American identity and its role</v>
<v Speaker 4>in the world dramatically.</v>

17
00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:27.780
<v Speaker 2>So I think the 2004 puppet sets higher</v>
<v Speaker 2>team America will police does a great</v>

18
00:01:27.971 --> 00:01:31.660
<v Speaker 2>job in depicting this proposed American</v>
<v Speaker 2>view of the war on terror.</v>

19
00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:35.650
<v Speaker 2>The story is about Acthar and spy and</v>
<v Speaker 2>Gary Johnson and his counter terrorism</v>

20
00:01:35.651 --> 00:01:38.140
<v Speaker 2>team as they take on terrorists</v>
<v Speaker 2>worldwide wide.</v>

21
00:01:38.141 --> 00:01:41.230
<v Speaker 2>And ultimately you have to confront the</v>
<v Speaker 2>biggest terrorist of all the late</v>

22
00:01:41.231 --> 00:01:43.210
<v Speaker 2>dictator of North Korea.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Kim Young,</v>

23
00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:46.180
<v Speaker 2>ill professional,</v>
<v Speaker 2>James Gow argues that the film reflects</v>

24
00:01:46.181 --> 00:01:50.170
<v Speaker 2>the of this realists interpretation of</v>
<v Speaker 2>international relations.</v>

25
00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:53.440
<v Speaker 2>Now what does that mean?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Constructivism is basically to clean.</v>

26
00:01:53.441 --> 00:01:57.130
<v Speaker 2>That's significant aspects of</v>
<v Speaker 2>international relations are historically</v>

27
00:01:57.131 --> 00:02:00.640
<v Speaker 2>and socially constructed and not the</v>
<v Speaker 2>consequence of human nature.</v>

28
00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:04.060
<v Speaker 2>Realism on the other hand,</v>
<v Speaker 2>can be thought of as unified by the</v>

29
00:02:04.061 --> 00:02:08.620
<v Speaker 2>belief that rural politics ultimately is</v>
<v Speaker 2>always and necessarily a field of</v>

30
00:02:08.621 --> 00:02:11.920
<v Speaker 2>conflict among actors pursuing power.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now if you're thinking,</v>

31
00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:13.990
<v Speaker 2>I don't understand this at all,</v>
<v Speaker 2>don't worry,</v>

32
00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:16.870
<v Speaker 2>the film was a brilliant job in</v>
<v Speaker 2>explaining the basic gist of it.</v>

33
00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:19.860
<v Speaker 5>There are three kinds of people,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Dick Pussy,</v>

34
00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:24.060
<v Speaker 5>pussy take,</v>
<v Speaker 5>everyone can get along and takes,</v>

35
00:02:24.070 --> 00:02:26.650
<v Speaker 5>just want to fuck all the time without</v>
<v Speaker 5>thinking it through.</v>

36
00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:30.610
<v Speaker 5>But then you got your ass check and all</v>
<v Speaker 5>the assholes.</v>

37
00:02:30.611 --> 00:02:32.500
<v Speaker 5>One got shit all over everything.</v>

38
00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:38.140
<v Speaker 2>So does a little bar room wisdom about</v>
<v Speaker 2>sexual relations actually turns out to</v>

39
00:02:38.141 --> 00:02:42.520
<v Speaker 2>be the most important scene of the movie</v>
<v Speaker 2>as it's ultimately what saves humanity</v>

40
00:02:42.521 --> 00:02:46.270
<v Speaker 2>from nuclear annihilation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The more importantly it lays bare to</v>

41
00:02:46.271 --> 00:02:47.920
<v Speaker 2>films,</v>
<v Speaker 2>philosophical core,</v>

42
00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:51.220
<v Speaker 2>the decks in the old man's story,</v>
<v Speaker 2>our team America,</v>

43
00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:53.920
<v Speaker 2>and an effect.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Everyone who acknowledges and support as</v>

44
00:02:53.921 --> 00:02:57.040
<v Speaker 2>America's assumed real life role as</v>
<v Speaker 2>beliefs force of the world.</v>

45
00:02:59.540 --> 00:03:03.430
<v Speaker 2>The all American white and blonde team</v>
<v Speaker 2>represents the hyperbole of patriotism,</v>

46
00:03:03.850 --> 00:03:07.060
<v Speaker 2>dressed in American flag combat gear,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and moving around in a similar style</v>

47
00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:09.430
<v Speaker 2>vehicles.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The team operates all over the globe</v>

48
00:03:09.431 --> 00:03:12.400
<v Speaker 2>with a well known American bravado when</v>
<v Speaker 2>the sense of optimism,</v>

49
00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:14.550
<v Speaker 2>their self confidence in their rule as</v>
<v Speaker 2>self,</v>

50
00:03:14.551 --> 00:03:17.710
<v Speaker 2>a clean police of the world.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's also their main weakness.</v>

51
00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:21.220
<v Speaker 2>Although the team is effective in</v>
<v Speaker 2>stopping terrorists around the globe and</v>

52
00:03:21.221 --> 00:03:24.730
<v Speaker 2>it's often crude and clumsy methods,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they end up doing more damage than the</v>

53
00:03:24.731 --> 00:03:25.990
<v Speaker 2>terrorists themselves.</v>

54
00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:31.140
<v Speaker 6>[inaudible]</v>

55
00:03:44.330 --> 00:03:45.163
<v Speaker 2>Damn,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I missed him,</v>

56
00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:48.200
<v Speaker 2>but it would be false to say that the</v>
<v Speaker 2>movie is enzyme American.</v>

57
00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:50.620
<v Speaker 2>On the contrary,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you to characters who publicly opposed</v>

58
00:03:50.621 --> 00:03:54.740
<v Speaker 2>to team notably to members of the film</v>
<v Speaker 2>actors guild or arguably made fun of the</v>

59
00:03:54.741 --> 00:03:59.210
<v Speaker 2>most met</v>
<v Speaker 2>the members of fag or the policies of</v>

60
00:03:59.211 --> 00:04:01.040
<v Speaker 2>the word.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They don't believe that violence will</v>

61
00:04:01.041 --> 00:04:04.850
<v Speaker 2>sub terrorism and don't want America to</v>
<v Speaker 2>act as a police force of the world.</v>

62
00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:06.980
<v Speaker 2>However,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as the old man pointed out,</v>

63
00:04:07.100 --> 00:04:10.310
<v Speaker 2>who sees our only one and a half inches</v>
<v Speaker 2>away from the assholes,</v>

64
00:04:10.430 --> 00:04:13.220
<v Speaker 2>and indeed in a criticism of team</v>
<v Speaker 2>America,</v>

65
00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:16.400
<v Speaker 2>the actress slowly started to turn into</v>
<v Speaker 2>terrorists themselves.</v>

66
00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:24.690
<v Speaker 2>The hassles of the movie art a</v>
<v Speaker 2>terrorists and Kim Jung,</v>

67
00:04:24.750 --> 00:04:26.730
<v Speaker 2>Il,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they don't care about anything but the</v>

68
00:04:26.731 --> 00:04:29.610
<v Speaker 2>destruction of modern civilization.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And all of these characters are</v>

69
00:04:29.611 --> 00:04:33.270
<v Speaker 2>portrayed and overtly stereotypical way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>In a Alaria segment,</v>

70
00:04:33.300 --> 00:04:36.420
<v Speaker 2>the team give Gary and quote unquote</v>
<v Speaker 2>elaborate makeover.</v>

71
00:04:36.510 --> 00:04:39.960
<v Speaker 2>So blend in with the terrorists.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now you would expect to see a new person</v>

72
00:04:39.961 --> 00:04:42.630
<v Speaker 2>as he comes out of the surgery,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but instead he returns with some brown</v>

73
00:04:42.631 --> 00:04:46.380
<v Speaker 2>paint on the skin and pubic hair on its</v>
<v Speaker 2>face and its whole resembling a turban</v>

74
00:04:46.410 --> 00:04:49.080
<v Speaker 2>on his head.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The joke reaches its climax is gary has</v>

75
00:04:49.081 --> 00:04:51.690
<v Speaker 2>to pass to Garza without raising any</v>
<v Speaker 2>suspicions.</v>

76
00:04:53.310 --> 00:04:54.270
<v Speaker 2>Buck,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Dirk,</v>

77
00:04:54.271 --> 00:04:55.170
<v Speaker 2>dirk or la?</v>

78
00:04:57.140 --> 00:04:57.430
<v Speaker 6>Okay.</v>

79
00:04:57.430 --> 00:04:59.770
<v Speaker 2>Durka Durka Mohammed Jihad.</v>

80
00:05:00.030 --> 00:05:00.863
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

81
00:05:01.370 --> 00:05:02.151
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>darker.</v>

82
00:05:02.151 --> 00:05:02.984
<v Speaker 2>Darker,</v>
<v Speaker 2>darker</v>

83
00:05:04.470 --> 00:05:06.200
<v Speaker 2>in North Korea.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Kim Jung.</v>

84
00:05:06.201 --> 00:05:10.130
<v Speaker 2>Il speaks broken English and lives in</v>
<v Speaker 2>the city of Chinese takeout boxes.</v>

85
00:05:10.740 --> 00:05:11.720
<v Speaker 2>Wait,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a round ring.</v>

86
00:05:13.260 --> 00:05:16.640
<v Speaker 2>Oh Man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All of this reinforces the</v>

87
00:05:16.641 --> 00:05:20.180
<v Speaker 2>constructivism president in the film.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The way the world is portrayed as the</v>

88
00:05:20.181 --> 00:05:24.350
<v Speaker 2>way America chooses to perceive it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it's this red or naive view that</v>

89
00:05:24.351 --> 00:05:27.320
<v Speaker 2>causes the team to have so many enemies.</v>
<v Speaker 2>However,</v>

90
00:05:27.350 --> 00:05:30.440
<v Speaker 2>Gary does realize in the end and chooses</v>
<v Speaker 2>to come to terms with it.</v>

91
00:05:30.740 --> 00:05:34.250
<v Speaker 2>Maca can definitely do better in their</v>
<v Speaker 2>role as world police,</v>

92
00:05:34.550 --> 00:05:38.380
<v Speaker 2>but they're constructivist.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Realist view does triumph and although</v>

93
00:05:38.381 --> 00:05:41.900
<v Speaker 2>the actors don't wish to accept this day</v>
<v Speaker 2>to ultimately see violence,</v>

94
00:05:41.901 --> 00:05:43.910
<v Speaker 2>it's the only means to protect her own</v>
<v Speaker 2>values.</v>

95
00:05:43.970 --> 00:05:47.720
<v Speaker 2>We can't look weak and powerless.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If violence is all those bastards</v>

96
00:05:47.721 --> 00:05:50.650
<v Speaker 2>understand that violence they'll get.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So despite all the heat,</v>

97
00:05:50.680 --> 00:05:52.900
<v Speaker 2>you American managers to dismantle a</v>
<v Speaker 2>cumulus,</v>

98
00:05:52.910 --> 00:05:55.400
<v Speaker 2>devious plan and save humanity from</v>
<v Speaker 2>certain night.</v>

99
00:05:55.401 --> 00:06:00.200
<v Speaker 2>Elation as philosopher and Admin Berg</v>
<v Speaker 2>once famously stated you only thing</v>

100
00:06:00.201 --> 00:06:03.530
<v Speaker 2>necessary for the triumph of evil is for</v>
<v Speaker 2>good men to do nothing.</v>

101
00:06:04.190 --> 00:06:05.590
<v Speaker 2>Or as the movie like suits explain it.</v>

102
00:06:05.960 --> 00:06:08.660
<v Speaker 5>I don't know much in this crazy,</v>
<v Speaker 5>crazy world,</v>

103
00:06:09.740 --> 00:06:14.240
<v Speaker 5>but I do know that if you don't let us</v>
<v Speaker 5>fuck this asshole,</v>

104
00:06:15.650 --> 00:06:18.290
<v Speaker 5>we're going to have our dicks and are</v>
<v Speaker 5>pussies</v>

105
00:06:19.310 --> 00:06:23.480
<v Speaker 2>all covered in shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's this sense of pragmatic realism</v>

106
00:06:23.481 --> 00:06:26.210
<v Speaker 2>that writer and director,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Trey Parker and Matt Stone are trying to</v>

107
00:06:26.211 --> 00:06:26.891
<v Speaker 2>convey.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's you.</v>

108
00:06:26.891 --> 00:06:30.230
<v Speaker 2>America won't beliefs and quiet.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Paradoxically it seems that's the</v>

109
00:06:30.240 --> 00:06:33.920
<v Speaker 2>America's goal to prevent and destroyed</v>
<v Speaker 2>terrorism all around the globe will</v>

110
00:06:33.921 --> 00:06:36.530
<v Speaker 2>never be finished.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Their view of the world means that there</v>

111
00:06:36.531 --> 00:06:39.590
<v Speaker 2>will always be a new terrorist in new</v>
<v Speaker 2>enemy to fight.</v>

112
00:06:39.980 --> 00:06:43.460
<v Speaker 2>And so far to the theory seems to have</v>
<v Speaker 2>rung true in real life as well.</v>

113
00:06:43.760 --> 00:06:47.270
<v Speaker 2>But in the NTU America doesn't really</v>
<v Speaker 2>care about what do you think their dicks</v>

114
00:06:47.330 --> 00:06:49.040
<v Speaker 2>and as long as there's assholes in the</v>
<v Speaker 2>world,</v>

115
00:06:49.140 --> 00:06:52.520
<v Speaker 2>it's all be Dick's willing to fuck them</v>
<v Speaker 2>again and again.</v>

116
00:06:55.650 --> 00:06:56.483
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>

117
00:06:56.920 --> 00:06:58.850
<v Speaker 2>All right guys,</v>
<v Speaker 2>thanks for watching.</v>

118
00:06:58.851 --> 00:07:01.460
<v Speaker 2>I hope you enjoyed the video.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's a couple of things that I</v>

119
00:07:01.461 --> 00:07:03.170
<v Speaker 2>quickly want to talk about.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

120
00:07:03.171 --> 00:07:04.760
<v Speaker 2>so first off,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as I'm recording this,</v>

121
00:07:04.761 --> 00:07:08.810
<v Speaker 2>we've just surpassed 2000 subscribers</v>
<v Speaker 2>and we honestly couldn't be happier with</v>

122
00:07:08.840 --> 00:07:10.940
<v Speaker 2>how things have developed over the last</v>
<v Speaker 2>couple of weeks.</v>

123
00:07:11.120 --> 00:07:11.871
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we never fought.</v>

124
00:07:11.871 --> 00:07:15.590
<v Speaker 2>We gain so many followers in this short</v>
<v Speaker 2>amount of time and we want to thank you</v>

125
00:07:15.591 --> 00:07:18.380
<v Speaker 2>all so much for supporting us and</v>
<v Speaker 2>spreading the word.</v>

126
00:07:18.770 --> 00:07:19.850
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's good stuff.</v>

127
00:07:19.940 --> 00:07:21.470
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a lot of you have been giving us</v>

128
00:07:21.471 --> 00:07:23.510
<v Speaker 2>constructive feedback on their work so</v>
<v Speaker 2>far.</v>

129
00:07:23.930 --> 00:07:26.030
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's mostly people saying that we sound</v>

130
00:07:26.090 --> 00:07:28.670
<v Speaker 2>a lot like the nerd writer did that we</v>
<v Speaker 2>want to say that.</v>

131
00:07:28.671 --> 00:07:31.220
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we do to an extent and honestly,</v>

132
00:07:31.240 --> 00:07:33.410
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't actively try to do so.</v>

133
00:07:33.560 --> 00:07:37.250
<v Speaker 2>I think it's mostly unconscious and just</v>
<v Speaker 2>the way that I personally like to do my</v>

134
00:07:37.251 --> 00:07:38.530
<v Speaker 2>voiceover,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

135
00:07:38.560 --> 00:07:41.360
<v Speaker 2>I think set that we're both trying to</v>
<v Speaker 2>move away from that a little bit and I</v>

136
00:07:41.361 --> 00:07:45.440
<v Speaker 2>believe with time our own personal voice</v>
<v Speaker 2>will start to shine through more and</v>

137
00:07:45.441 --> 00:07:46.820
<v Speaker 2>more.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Secondly,</v>

138
00:07:46.821 --> 00:07:49.520
<v Speaker 2>you've tried turning down the volume on</v>
<v Speaker 2>the background music a little bit,</v>

139
00:07:49.880 --> 00:07:51.950
<v Speaker 2>so I believe that shouldn't be an issue</v>
<v Speaker 2>anymore.</v>

140
00:07:52.160 --> 00:07:53.930
<v Speaker 2>Thanks for pointing it out to us.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Finally,</v>

141
00:07:53.931 --> 00:07:58.460
<v Speaker 2>I want to invite all of you to follow us</v>
