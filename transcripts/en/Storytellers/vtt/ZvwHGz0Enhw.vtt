1
00:00:12.950 --> 00:00:15.710
<v Speaker 1>So a question.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that's many people have been</v>

2
00:00:15.711 --> 00:00:18.600
<v Speaker 1>asking themselves more and more in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>last 15 years.</v>

3
00:00:19.610 --> 00:00:22.640
<v Speaker 1>How could this all happen?</v>
<v Speaker 1>We live in an information age where</v>

4
00:00:22.641 --> 00:00:26.990
<v Speaker 1>government and corporations have more</v>
<v Speaker 1>access to personal information than ever</v>

5
00:00:26.991 --> 00:00:29.390
<v Speaker 1>before.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a constant debate between</v>

6
00:00:29.391 --> 00:00:31.520
<v Speaker 1>privacy and safety instead of</v>

7
00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:36.200
<v Speaker 2>people to follow you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We use the devices that you paid for the</v>

8
00:00:36.201 --> 00:00:41.201
<v Speaker 2>services and the systems that surround</v>
<v Speaker 2>you invisibly every day to watch you on</v>

9
00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:42.740
<v Speaker 2>our behalf.</v>

10
00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:45.330
<v Speaker 1>So why are so much,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there was a tech slipping through the</v>

11
00:00:45.331 --> 00:00:48.630
<v Speaker 1>cracks of our counter terrorism and</v>
<v Speaker 1>intelligence agencies.</v>

12
00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:52.620
<v Speaker 1>I think it's interesting to look at a</v>
<v Speaker 1>few of counterterrorism ans Howard might</v>

13
00:00:52.621 --> 00:00:55.140
<v Speaker 1>be influenced by the films and series to</v>
<v Speaker 1>watch.</v>

14
00:00:55.290 --> 00:00:59.760
<v Speaker 1>An important aspect or film analysis is</v>
<v Speaker 1>to look at our films and series are not</v>

15
00:00:59.761 --> 00:01:01.320
<v Speaker 1>only shaped by culture,</v>
<v Speaker 1>history,</v>

16
00:01:01.321 --> 00:01:03.660
<v Speaker 1>and politics,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but also how they influence these</v>

17
00:01:03.661 --> 00:01:06.540
<v Speaker 1>things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>As media scholar j Belton status myth</v>

18
00:01:06.541 --> 00:01:09.750
<v Speaker 1>has to become part of the cultural</v>
<v Speaker 1>language by which America on the stance</v>

19
00:01:09.751 --> 00:01:13.620
<v Speaker 1>itself and popular films serve as a</v>
<v Speaker 1>barometer of contemporary political</v>

20
00:01:13.621 --> 00:01:16.180
<v Speaker 1>history.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Examples of this regarding our historic</v>

21
00:01:16.181 --> 00:01:20.160
<v Speaker 1>on standing our movies such as saving</v>
<v Speaker 1>private Ryan and the gladiator.</v>

22
00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:26.463
<v Speaker 2>You're</v>

23
00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:31.620
<v Speaker 1>these films definitely shape and</v>
<v Speaker 1>influence our fuse of this historical</v>

24
00:01:31.621 --> 00:01:35.550
<v Speaker 1>time periods.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Looking at current issues of</v>

25
00:01:35.551 --> 00:01:38.310
<v Speaker 1>counterterrorism,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it would be logical to assume that since</v>

26
00:01:38.311 --> 00:01:41.520
<v Speaker 1>everything is filmed and documents,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we can easily see the differences</v>

27
00:01:41.521 --> 00:01:44.940
<v Speaker 1>between the reality of these issues and</v>
<v Speaker 1>its representation in fiction,</v>

28
00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:47.220
<v Speaker 1>but I would argue it's not that simple.</v>

29
00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:49.730
<v Speaker 3>I want all his phones.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's blackberry,</v>

30
00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:51.860
<v Speaker 3>the apartment,</v>
<v Speaker 3>his car,</v>

31
00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:54.020
<v Speaker 3>bank accounts,</v>
<v Speaker 3>credit cards,</v>

32
00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:55.880
<v Speaker 3>travel patterns.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I want to know what he's going to think</v>

33
00:01:55.881 --> 00:02:00.200
<v Speaker 3>before he does every dirty little secret</v>
<v Speaker 3>he has and most of all we want the name</v>

34
00:02:00.201 --> 00:02:05.201
<v Speaker 3>and real time location of his source.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is NSA priority level for any</v>

35
00:02:05.241 --> 00:02:06.074
<v Speaker 3>questions.</v>

36
00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:09.370
<v Speaker 2>All right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's get to it.</v>

37
00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:13.300
<v Speaker 1>That seems to be more and more distrust</v>
<v Speaker 1>towards the information presented by the</v>

38
00:02:13.301 --> 00:02:17.980
<v Speaker 1>government and to news organizations and</v>
<v Speaker 1>the workings of intelligence agencies</v>

39
00:02:17.981 --> 00:02:21.050
<v Speaker 1>are clouded in secrecy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if you don't feel we're an accurate</v>

40
00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:23.380
<v Speaker 1>view of the workings of counter</v>
<v Speaker 1>terrorism,</v>

41
00:02:23.381 --> 00:02:27.430
<v Speaker 1>then it is important to look at my films</v>
<v Speaker 1>and series represented in a certain way.</v>

42
00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:30.940
<v Speaker 1>And how does busbee be shapes our</v>
<v Speaker 1>understanding in the words or bad</v>

43
00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:35.470
<v Speaker 1>baritones popularity off contemporary</v>
<v Speaker 1>conspiracy films represent a hunger for</v>

44
00:02:35.471 --> 00:02:40.300
<v Speaker 1>explanatory narrative of global</v>
<v Speaker 1>terrorism and counterterrorism in 24</v>

45
00:02:40.301 --> 00:02:44.050
<v Speaker 1>every season there's a new terrorist</v>
<v Speaker 1>threat that check bower with the help of</v>

46
00:02:44.051 --> 00:02:48.730
<v Speaker 1>chloe and the counter terrorist unit or</v>
<v Speaker 1>CPU needs to prevent a reoccurring</v>

47
00:02:48.731 --> 00:02:53.320
<v Speaker 1>aspect off 24 is the use of torture to</v>
<v Speaker 1>gain critical information to prevent an</v>

48
00:02:53.321 --> 00:02:54.154
<v Speaker 1>attack.</v>

49
00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:57.090
<v Speaker 2>You gotta tell me what I want to know</v>
<v Speaker 2>what you're going to start losing your</v>

50
00:02:57.091 --> 00:02:57.960
<v Speaker 2>fingers one by one</v>

51
00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:05.420
<v Speaker 1>last chance.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This often proves successful.</v>

52
00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:16.970
<v Speaker 1>Devastating.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's torture is legitimate strategy to</v>

53
00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:19.040
<v Speaker 1>counter terrorist threats.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jack,</v>

54
00:03:19.041 --> 00:03:21.050
<v Speaker 1>what if this doesn't work?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm never fell in pharmaceutical</v>

55
00:03:21.051 --> 00:03:21.980
<v Speaker 1>torture.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All that effect.</v>

56
00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:27.300
<v Speaker 1>And I have it turned out that the dean</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the US Military Academy at westpoint</v>

57
00:03:27.380 --> 00:03:31.520
<v Speaker 1>stated that the series was to direct</v>
<v Speaker 1>costs for wrongful behavioral few as</v>

58
00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:32.960
<v Speaker 1>troops in Iraq.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Of course,</v>

59
00:03:32.961 --> 00:03:37.160
<v Speaker 1>in those years to a few years of torture</v>
<v Speaker 1>became a nationwide debate and newer</v>

60
00:03:37.161 --> 00:03:40.010
<v Speaker 1>films and shows half adopted a different</v>
<v Speaker 1>perspective on it.</v>

61
00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:45.170
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>

62
00:03:56.030 --> 00:03:59.900
<v Speaker 1>Another interesting aspect is that</v>
<v Speaker 1>within 24 and other films are serious</v>

63
00:03:59.901 --> 00:04:03.260
<v Speaker 1>that deal with terrorism,</v>
<v Speaker 1>although to terrorist threats come from</v>

64
00:04:03.261 --> 00:04:05.600
<v Speaker 1>a wide range or groups and</v>
<v Speaker 1>nationalities,</v>

65
00:04:05.660 --> 00:04:07.910
<v Speaker 1>Chinese radical Muslims,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Russians.</v>

66
00:04:07.970 --> 00:04:11.420
<v Speaker 1>There's almost always an aspect of</v>
<v Speaker 1>internal betrayal by people within the</v>

67
00:04:11.421 --> 00:04:14.690
<v Speaker 1>agencies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The born shaves even flips it around and</v>

68
00:04:14.691 --> 00:04:17.750
<v Speaker 1>test the horse.</v>
<v Speaker 1>CIS grew up with just one person that is</v>

69
00:04:17.751 --> 00:04:21.710
<v Speaker 1>trying to restore its integrity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This of course does represent and</v>

70
00:04:21.740 --> 00:04:26.060
<v Speaker 1>reinforced the public distrust in</v>
<v Speaker 1>government and the agencies and ends</v>

71
00:04:26.061 --> 00:04:29.660
<v Speaker 1>when we've won.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The last aspect that I want to discuss</v>

72
00:04:29.661 --> 00:04:33.740
<v Speaker 1>is the representation of the abilities</v>
<v Speaker 1>of these intelligence agencies.</v>

73
00:04:34.130 --> 00:04:38.450
<v Speaker 1>In many films and series and especially</v>
<v Speaker 1>the born serious disabilities are highly</v>

74
00:04:38.451 --> 00:04:43.410
<v Speaker 1>overrated as and states insofar as</v>
<v Speaker 1>counter intelligence narratives utilize</v>

75
00:04:43.411 --> 00:04:47.480
<v Speaker 1>pseudo expert jargon and mucked up</v>
<v Speaker 1>technical imagery to provide an illusion</v>

76
00:04:47.481 --> 00:04:50.120
<v Speaker 1>of scientific accuracy and</v>
<v Speaker 1>sophistication.</v>

77
00:04:50.150 --> 00:04:54.260
<v Speaker 1>They reframed the mundane limitations</v>
<v Speaker 1>off rewards environments as</v>

78
00:04:54.320 --> 00:04:56.840
<v Speaker 1>technological fantasies in the bone or</v>
<v Speaker 1>the made them.</v>

79
00:04:56.841 --> 00:05:00.080
<v Speaker 1>For example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the CIA headquarters can easily switch</v>

80
00:05:00.081 --> 00:05:04.490
<v Speaker 1>from a macro view of Europe to a CCTV</v>
<v Speaker 1>stream of a particular street.</v>

81
00:05:04.820 --> 00:05:07.460
<v Speaker 1>In reality,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the technology and possibilities are</v>

82
00:05:07.461 --> 00:05:08.930
<v Speaker 1>much more limited.</v>
<v Speaker 1>For one,</v>

83
00:05:08.931 --> 00:05:12.860
<v Speaker 1>it's not so easy to switch between</v>
<v Speaker 1>various systems and a big problem</v>

84
00:05:12.861 --> 00:05:16.790
<v Speaker 1>according to Christopher Andrew's book</v>
<v Speaker 1>on secret intelligence is sifting</v>

85
00:05:16.791 --> 00:05:20.510
<v Speaker 1>through massive amounts of collected</v>
<v Speaker 1>data yet and the Bourne ultimatum.</v>

86
00:05:20.511 --> 00:05:23.270
<v Speaker 1>They seem to hear and see everything</v>
<v Speaker 1>instantly.</v>

87
00:05:23.570 --> 00:05:23.880
<v Speaker 5>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 5>on,</v>

88
00:05:23.880 --> 00:05:28.470
<v Speaker 5>I'm on black Friday with pete black</v>
<v Speaker 5>prior looks like it's coming from a</v>

89
00:05:28.471 --> 00:05:30.150
<v Speaker 5>European signal.</v>

90
00:05:30.380 --> 00:05:32.720
<v Speaker 1>As he says.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Even with good intelligence,</v>

91
00:05:32.721 --> 00:05:37.600
<v Speaker 1>we can foresee the future only s Saint</v>
<v Speaker 1>Paul claims heaven to dark and the story</v>

92
00:05:37.601 --> 00:05:40.130
<v Speaker 1>of glass.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would say that although intelligence</v>

93
00:05:40.131 --> 00:05:44.750
<v Speaker 1>technology is becoming more financed and</v>
<v Speaker 1>the debate about privacy is definitely</v>

94
00:05:44.751 --> 00:05:47.510
<v Speaker 1>worth having,</v>
<v Speaker 1>governments don't have the optical few</v>

95
00:05:47.511 --> 00:05:50.420
<v Speaker 1>of the whole world that they can access</v>
<v Speaker 1>anytime they want.</v>

96
00:05:50.600 --> 00:05:55.600
<v Speaker 5>This vast collection of data is not that</v>
<v Speaker 5>useful and infringes a substantially on</v>

97
00:05:57.381 --> 00:05:58.310
<v Speaker 5>personal privacy</v>

98
00:05:58.370 --> 00:06:01.970
<v Speaker 1>should be aware of how our perception</v>
<v Speaker 1>could be partially shaped by popular</v>

99
00:06:01.971 --> 00:06:06.530
<v Speaker 1>culture because although these films and</v>
<v Speaker 1>cvs have to create a freedom of fiction</v>

100
00:06:06.710 --> 00:06:08.720
<v Speaker 1>is to distrust in government,</v>
<v Speaker 1>gross,</v>

101
00:06:08.730 --> 00:06:12.620
<v Speaker 1>the burden off reality may become the</v>
<v Speaker 1>responsibility or fiction.</v>

102
00:06:13.130 --> 00:06:15.960
<v Speaker 1>My name is Edward Snowden.</v>

103
00:06:18.830 --> 00:06:20.500
<v Speaker 1>All right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Thank you so much for watching.</v>

104
00:06:20.560 --> 00:06:22.180
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the last two weeks we've got some</v>

105
00:06:22.181 --> 00:06:25.270
<v Speaker 1>awesome exposure and you gave us all</v>
<v Speaker 1>amazing feedback.</v>

106
00:06:25.380 --> 00:06:27.640
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm working on my voice and we'll try to</v>

107
00:06:27.641 --> 00:06:31.630
<v Speaker 1>improve it a little bit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Every video we are also working hard on</v>

108
00:06:31.631 --> 00:06:34.510
<v Speaker 1>sound mixing and of course our skillsets</v>
<v Speaker 1>altogether.</v>

109
00:06:35.180 --> 00:06:37.060
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>almost got some feedback is a little bit</v>

110
00:06:37.061 --> 00:06:38.930
<v Speaker 1>too much like the neuro iterator.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

111
00:06:38.980 --> 00:06:41.560
<v Speaker 1>but we are taking this as a huge</v>
<v Speaker 1>compliment.</v>

112
00:06:41.590 --> 00:06:44.820
<v Speaker 1>We will definitely try to create more of</v>
<v Speaker 1>our own style in the future.</v>

113
00:06:44.821 --> 00:06:45.670
<v Speaker 1>Though,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of course,</v>

114
00:06:45.671 --> 00:06:48.430
<v Speaker 1>we recently started and we are fully</v>
<v Speaker 1>aware of that.</v>

115
00:06:48.431 --> 00:06:52.060
<v Speaker 1>We have mountains of learning to do and</v>
<v Speaker 1>we are constantly looking for ways to</v>

116
00:06:52.061 --> 00:06:52.940
<v Speaker 1>improve.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

117
00:06:52.960 --> 00:06:54.940
<v Speaker 1>with regards to this video.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm sorry.</v>

118
00:06:54.941 --> 00:06:57.160
