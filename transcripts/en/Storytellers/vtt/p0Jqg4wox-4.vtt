1
00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:22.900
<v Speaker 1>The opening scene of classic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Terminator immediately aligns its</v>

2
00:00:22.941 --> 00:00:27.030
<v Speaker 1>audience with the films may feet men</v>
<v Speaker 1>versus machine.</v>

3
00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:31.160
<v Speaker 1>This fee,</v>
<v Speaker 1>rum stroud's entire movie as calories</v>

4
00:00:31.280 --> 00:00:35.480
<v Speaker 1>and a German etr or sent back in time to</v>
<v Speaker 1>duke it out over Sour O'connor's life.</v>

5
00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:38.690
<v Speaker 1>Both men and machine are fighting for</v>
<v Speaker 1>their very existence.</v>

6
00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:40.820
<v Speaker 1>One is trying to killed a mater of</v>
<v Speaker 1>mankind,</v>

7
00:00:40.821 --> 00:00:43.610
<v Speaker 1>savior walls.</v>
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible] seeks to protect her from</v>

8
00:00:43.611 --> 00:00:45.490
<v Speaker 1>harm.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The Co finance roof,</v>

9
00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:50.500
<v Speaker 1>the film Arriann pictures known for</v>
<v Speaker 1>classics such as Amadeus and two</v>

10
00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:57.980
<v Speaker 1>didn't think very highly of the story</v>
<v Speaker 1>and reportedly only perceived the film</v>

11
00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:00.650
<v Speaker 1>as a low budget vehicle to make some</v>
<v Speaker 1>quick money.</v>

12
00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:04.580
<v Speaker 1>Even James Cameron wasn't old at certain</v>
<v Speaker 1>off the potential of the film</v>

13
00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:06.840
<v Speaker 2>Terminator One was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>was uh,</v>

14
00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:09.450
<v Speaker 2>like a hallucination for me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was making my first,</v>

15
00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:11.910
<v Speaker 2>my first picture.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I had no idea it was really going to be</v>

16
00:01:11.911 --> 00:01:12.960
<v Speaker 2>a success.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

17
00:01:12.961 --> 00:01:14.370
<v Speaker 2>when I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when I wrote it,</v>

18
00:01:14.371 --> 00:01:17.490
<v Speaker 2>I probably thought it has stood the</v>
<v Speaker 2>chance of being a success.</v>

19
00:01:17.550 --> 00:01:19.140
<v Speaker 2>I wrote it that way on purpose,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

20
00:01:19.141 --> 00:01:22.950
<v Speaker 2>but you never really believed that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that it's going to happen or that it can</v>

21
00:01:22.951 --> 00:01:23.450
<v Speaker 2>happen.</v>

22
00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:26.670
<v Speaker 1>Arielle and picture saw in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>terminator is straight forward action</v>

23
00:01:27.470 --> 00:01:32.470
<v Speaker 1>but field to see what lay hidden beneath</v>
<v Speaker 1>all the onscreen violence or as the</v>

24
00:01:32.901 --> 00:01:34.520
<v Speaker 1>terminator himself explains it.</v>

25
00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:39.960
<v Speaker 2>I always felt that this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this was more than the ordinary action</v>

26
00:01:40.001 --> 00:01:45.001
<v Speaker 2>film and it was more than a special</v>
<v Speaker 2>effects from and uh,</v>

27
00:01:45.730 --> 00:01:48.940
<v Speaker 2>or like with some thought was just a b</v>
<v Speaker 2>movie.</v>

28
00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:52.660
<v Speaker 2>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think the story is so solid and so</v>

29
00:01:52.661 --> 00:01:55.840
<v Speaker 2>good and it has so many interesting</v>
<v Speaker 2>messages there and it is also</v>

30
00:01:55.841 --> 00:01:58.480
<v Speaker 2>entertaining and so they will have a</v>
<v Speaker 2>broad appeal</v>

31
00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:01.410
<v Speaker 1>because when we look past the surface</v>
<v Speaker 1>level,</v>

32
00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:04.680
<v Speaker 1>another more encompassing theme revealed</v>
<v Speaker 1>itself,</v>

33
00:02:05.220 --> 00:02:09.690
<v Speaker 1>religion versus technology,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the human spirit versus the program</v>

34
00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:14.720
<v Speaker 1>mine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Cause as the story moves into La of</v>

35
00:02:33.151 --> 00:02:36.090
<v Speaker 1>1984,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you might expect to see it widely</v>

36
00:02:36.091 --> 00:02:39.990
<v Speaker 1>contracting world from the post nuclear</v>
<v Speaker 1>wasteland from the star of the movie.</v>

37
00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:42.960
<v Speaker 1>However,</v>
<v Speaker 1>director James Cameron decided to make</v>

38
00:02:42.990 --> 00:02:47.220
<v Speaker 1>la of the ADC gritty,</v>
<v Speaker 1>gray and arguably hostile place.</v>

39
00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:52.700
<v Speaker 1>Fuck you asshole.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Of course</v>

40
00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:04.840
<v Speaker 3>human guy and is still very much alive</v>
<v Speaker 3>and in control button is already</v>

41
00:03:04.841 --> 00:03:06.970
<v Speaker 3>becoming apparent that the world is in</v>
<v Speaker 3>decline.</v>

42
00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:11.270
<v Speaker 3>New Technologies such as widespread use</v>
<v Speaker 3>of color tvs,</v>

43
00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:13.900
<v Speaker 3>board will,</v>
<v Speaker 3>cassette players and techno music.</v>

44
00:03:13.901 --> 00:03:18.880
<v Speaker 3>I've invaded both the private as well as</v>
<v Speaker 3>the public space as people seem to be in</v>

45
00:03:18.881 --> 00:03:22.150
<v Speaker 3>the kind of trends oblivious to the</v>
<v Speaker 3>world around them.</v>

46
00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:26.350
<v Speaker 3>An example is ginger's obsession with</v>
<v Speaker 3>her music player.</v>

47
00:03:27.070 --> 00:03:29.440
<v Speaker 3>She's dancing around the house,</v>
<v Speaker 3>stuck in her own world.</v>

48
00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:32.110
<v Speaker 3>First she doesn't hear the ring of her</v>
<v Speaker 3>phone,</v>

49
00:03:34.330 --> 00:03:36.370
<v Speaker 3>then she doesn't hear Sarah calling her</v>
<v Speaker 3>name,</v>

50
00:03:37.300 --> 00:03:40.630
<v Speaker 3>gender,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's matte and the first time,</v>

51
00:03:40.990 --> 00:03:41.823
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

52
00:03:50.240 --> 00:03:53.780
<v Speaker 1>another example is the club scene.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Where do people dancing are completely</v>

53
00:03:53.781 --> 00:03:57.830
<v Speaker 1>oblivious to the and Fred and even in to</v>
<v Speaker 1>the existence of our three main</v>

54
00:03:57.831 --> 00:04:01.910
<v Speaker 1>characters in general.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No one even as much as glances at the</v>

55
00:04:01.911 --> 00:04:05.930
<v Speaker 1>massive terminator as he handed it to</v>
<v Speaker 1>club and even security is slow to react.</v>

56
00:04:13.760 --> 00:04:18.760
<v Speaker 1>The people of La are not only oblivious,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're also seen to be egotistical and</v>

57
00:04:19.400 --> 00:04:22.430
<v Speaker 1>apathetic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The police officers don't seem to care</v>

58
00:04:22.431 --> 00:04:26.210
<v Speaker 1>about an act of serial killer</v>
<v Speaker 1>systematically terminating all the sour</v>

59
00:04:26.211 --> 00:04:29.450
<v Speaker 1>conners in town.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Are sure there's a point to all of this.</v>

60
00:04:29.900 --> 00:04:32.990
<v Speaker 1>It is only when confronted with</v>
<v Speaker 1>potential bad press did they decide to</v>

61
00:04:32.991 --> 00:04:36.160
<v Speaker 1>take action hitting me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The press is going to be short stroking</v>

62
00:04:36.170 --> 00:04:37.550
<v Speaker 1>and all over the place.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

63
00:04:37.580 --> 00:04:41.270
<v Speaker 1>one day pattern together.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I hate the weird ones.</v>

64
00:04:41.690 --> 00:04:45.020
<v Speaker 1>Even the people whose job it is to</v>
<v Speaker 1>listen to you and help out or is it only</v>

65
00:04:45.021 --> 00:04:49.340
<v Speaker 1>seems to care about themselves choice.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The psychiatrist tasked with analyzing</v>

66
00:04:49.341 --> 00:04:51.910
<v Speaker 1>Carl Sanity isn't really listening to</v>
<v Speaker 1>him.</v>

67
00:04:51.940 --> 00:04:53.720
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's actually just thinking of how a</v>

68
00:04:53.721 --> 00:04:57.140
<v Speaker 1>story could elevate his own career</v>
<v Speaker 1>surrounded by living tissue.</v>

69
00:04:57.200 --> 00:05:00.320
<v Speaker 1>How right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is great stuff.</v>

70
00:05:00.321 --> 00:05:04.340
<v Speaker 1>I could make a career out of this guy</v>
<v Speaker 1>and later on when the terminators run</v>

71
00:05:04.341 --> 00:05:07.640
<v Speaker 1>over by a truck,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you might expect the driver to call for</v>

72
00:05:07.641 --> 00:05:09.290
<v Speaker 1>help,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but alas,</v>

73
00:05:09.620 --> 00:05:13.800
<v Speaker 3>that's good addict.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Good.</v>

74
00:05:15.730 --> 00:05:19.480
<v Speaker 1>Someone Murray's says that has become</v>
<v Speaker 1>very hard to spot a Cyborg.</v>

75
00:05:19.920 --> 00:05:22.390
<v Speaker 1>It is not only because they look like</v>
<v Speaker 1>us,</v>

76
00:05:23.020 --> 00:05:25.830
<v Speaker 1>but mainly because when we lose our own</v>
<v Speaker 1>humanness,</v>

77
00:05:26.320 --> 00:05:31.320
<v Speaker 1>we are starting to act like den.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fuck you,</v>

78
00:05:32.841 --> 00:05:37.841
<v Speaker 1>ass whore Sarah and you only ones who</v>
<v Speaker 1>exhibit the traits that human kind and</v>

79
00:05:37.851 --> 00:05:42.230
<v Speaker 1>terminators seems to have lost.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They show compassion to each other and</v>

80
00:05:42.231 --> 00:05:45.200
<v Speaker 1>animals alike.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I came across time for you,</v>

81
00:05:45.201 --> 00:05:46.034
<v Speaker 1>sir.</v>

82
00:05:47.460 --> 00:05:51.480
<v Speaker 3>Have you</v>
<v Speaker 3>always have me</v>

83
00:05:55.410 --> 00:05:58.490
<v Speaker 1>disgusting?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sarah's almost naive innocence stands in</v>

84
00:05:58.491 --> 00:06:01.010
<v Speaker 1>stark contrast to the world and the</v>
<v Speaker 1>people around her,</v>

85
00:06:01.880 --> 00:06:04.880
<v Speaker 1>her worth to the world,</v>
<v Speaker 1>dramatically shifts from a clumsy</v>

86
00:06:04.881 --> 00:06:07.700
<v Speaker 1>waitress to the mater of mankind.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Savior.</v>

87
00:06:08.390 --> 00:06:12.200
<v Speaker 1>You could even argue that Sarah Connor</v>
<v Speaker 1>is an essence,</v>

88
00:06:12.380 --> 00:06:15.920
<v Speaker 1>the biblical Maria,</v>
<v Speaker 1>her innocence and humanities Cetera,</v>

89
00:06:15.940 --> 00:06:20.900
<v Speaker 1>apart from our fellow human beings,</v>
<v Speaker 1>her friend Ginger even acknowledges her</v>

90
00:06:20.901 --> 00:06:25.901
<v Speaker 1>divine worth better than mortal man</v>
<v Speaker 1>deserves and ironically she gets</v>

91
00:06:25.911 --> 00:06:30.260
<v Speaker 1>impregnated by somewhat immortal</v>
<v Speaker 1>character because even though rees dies</v>

92
00:06:30.261 --> 00:06:33.440
<v Speaker 1>in the end,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the paradoxical loop has been created</v>

93
00:06:33.441 --> 00:06:37.040
<v Speaker 1>and we'll make sure that this event will</v>
<v Speaker 1>keep repeating itself forever.</v>

94
00:06:37.580 --> 00:06:39.710
<v Speaker 1>God,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a person could go crazy thinking about</v>

95
00:06:39.711 --> 00:06:40.880
<v Speaker 1>this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ultimately,</v>

96
00:06:40.881 --> 00:06:45.881
<v Speaker 1>she will give birth to John Connor or</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jesus Christ who will bring salvation to</v>

97
00:06:46.911 --> 00:06:50.210
<v Speaker 1>mankind,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who will wake us up right before our own</v>

98
00:06:50.270 --> 00:06:54.290
<v Speaker 1>extinction.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Robert McKee calls this grove symbolic</v>

99
00:06:54.291 --> 00:06:57.440
<v Speaker 1>progression.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We start a story with actions,</v>

100
00:06:57.441 --> 00:06:58.880
<v Speaker 1>locations,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and roles.</v>

101
00:06:59.060 --> 00:07:03.860
<v Speaker 1>The represent only themselves,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but a truly great film lists to tell him</v>

102
00:07:03.861 --> 00:07:07.970
<v Speaker 1>to the next level.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Exposivity from the particular to the</v>

103
00:07:07.971 --> 00:07:11.240
<v Speaker 1>universal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>from the specific to the archival</v>

104
00:07:11.990 --> 00:07:16.030
<v Speaker 1>besides the story of Jesus Christ and</v>
<v Speaker 1>the key fines and the terminator echoes</v>

105
00:07:16.040 --> 00:07:20.630
<v Speaker 1>the ancient archetype of the maze.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The mythological battle between</v>

106
00:07:20.670 --> 00:07:24.740
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible] and the minutes are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and indeed most of the action of the</v>

107
00:07:24.741 --> 00:07:27.770
<v Speaker 1>film takes place in corridors,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hallways,</v>

108
00:07:28.340 --> 00:07:32.600
<v Speaker 1>alleyways and the like.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The freedom of space in the terminator</v>

109
00:07:32.601 --> 00:07:35.690
<v Speaker 1>is limited.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Even the chase scene on the highway,</v>

110
00:07:35.720 --> 00:07:39.530
<v Speaker 1>it takes place in a tunnel.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It closed off environment source.</v>

111
00:07:40.100 --> 00:07:44.540
<v Speaker 1>So James Cameron shows us stories that</v>
<v Speaker 1>have been taught throughout the ages to</v>

112
00:07:44.541 --> 00:07:46.640
<v Speaker 1>confront us with fears of what lies</v>
<v Speaker 1>ahead.</v>

113
00:07:46.970 --> 00:07:49.550
<v Speaker 1>Determinator franchise has survived up</v>
<v Speaker 1>until now,</v>

114
00:07:49.700 --> 00:07:53.660
<v Speaker 1>and this might partly be because it's</v>
<v Speaker 1>subject is now more relevant than ever.</v>

115
00:07:54.470 --> 00:07:56.720
<v Speaker 1>The majority of the world owns a</v>
<v Speaker 1>smartphone.</v>

116
00:07:57.110 --> 00:08:01.220
<v Speaker 1>Technology literally surrounds us and</v>
<v Speaker 1>changes our perception of the world.</v>

117
00:08:01.670 --> 00:08:05.420
<v Speaker 1>Hopes and fears of the future.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Invention of ai have entered the public</v>

118
00:08:05.421 --> 00:08:09.260
<v Speaker 1>arena.</v>
<v Speaker 1>James Cameron for saw a dark future for</v>

119
00:08:09.261 --> 00:08:13.250
<v Speaker 1>humanity with the terminator,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but also provided us with hope of</v>

120
00:08:13.251 --> 00:08:16.760
<v Speaker 1>changing the outcome.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Silver dust ultimately defeat</v>

121
00:08:16.800 --> 00:08:20.000
<v Speaker 1>determinator by working together with</v>
<v Speaker 1>the machines of her own time.</v>

122
00:08:20.600 --> 00:08:23.910
<v Speaker 1>Yet the front of Doomsday remains.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a storm coming.</v>

123
00:08:28.980 --> 00:08:29.813
<v Speaker 4>I know.</v>

124
00:08:30.570 --> 00:08:34.470
<v Speaker 1>So next time when you don't understand</v>
<v Speaker 1>why a certain film has done so well,</v>

125
00:08:35.010 --> 00:08:38.370
<v Speaker 1>look at the progression.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Look at the archetypes,</v>

126
00:08:38.700 --> 00:08:43.110
<v Speaker 1>because every great new story is often</v>
<v Speaker 1>the product of an old one.</v>

127
00:08:43.230 --> 00:08:46.790
<v Speaker 4>I tell you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I owe him that.</v>

128
00:08:49.920 --> 00:08:54.920
<v Speaker 4>Maybe it'll help if he,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know that in a few hours that we had</v>

129
00:08:56.431 --> 00:09:01.431
<v Speaker 4>together,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we left a lifetime's worth my,</v>

130
00:09:02.400 --> 00:09:03.480
<v Speaker 4>wait,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's a bench over there.</v>

131
00:09:15.460 --> 00:09:16.510
<v Speaker 3>I'll be back.</v>
