1
00:00:01.360 --> 00:00:05.160
<v Speaker 1>And she's carrying something.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not uncommon for a film to reveal</v>

2
00:00:05.161 --> 00:00:08.250
<v Speaker 1>its main theme and the opening scene of</v>
<v Speaker 1>its story and Esu.</v>

3
00:00:08.310 --> 00:00:11.340
<v Speaker 1>Grab the audience's attention and give</v>
<v Speaker 1>them a taste of what's to come,</v>

4
00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:15.000
<v Speaker 1>not unlike to ferry essay that I'm</v>
<v Speaker 1>reading to you right now or really any</v>

5
00:00:15.001 --> 00:00:17.820
<v Speaker 1>other medium to tries to effectively</v>
<v Speaker 1>convey a message.</v>

6
00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:21.370
<v Speaker 1>American sniper,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as you can see here is no exception to</v>

7
00:00:21.371 --> 00:00:24.750
<v Speaker 1>this navy seal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Chris Kyle is laying on a rooftop in war</v>

8
00:00:24.751 --> 00:00:28.380
<v Speaker 1>torn Fallujah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>His rifle aimed at a mother and her son</v>

9
00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:31.110
<v Speaker 1>away for Clint Eastwood to point us to</v>
<v Speaker 1>his films,</v>

10
00:00:31.111 --> 00:00:35.610
<v Speaker 1>main theme family or rather the tragic</v>
<v Speaker 1>destruction of family through war.</v>

11
00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.310
<v Speaker 1>However,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it seems that this message didn't really</v>

12
00:00:38.311 --> 00:00:41.100
<v Speaker 1>get you on to a number of high profile</v>
<v Speaker 1>audiences.</v>

13
00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:44.630
<v Speaker 1>Most notable or tweets from the likes of</v>
<v Speaker 1>Seth Rogan,</v>

14
00:00:44.631 --> 00:00:48.770
<v Speaker 1>who compared to films who to throw Nazi</v>
<v Speaker 1>propaganda movie shown and the third act</v>

15
00:00:48.771 --> 00:00:49.910
<v Speaker 1>of inglorious bastards.</v>

16
00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:53.060
<v Speaker 1>Then there is Michael Moore staying at</v>
<v Speaker 1>all snipers are cowards.</v>

17
00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:57.590
<v Speaker 1>No on Chomsky weighing in on what he</v>
<v Speaker 1>states is a testament of support of</v>

18
00:00:57.591 --> 00:01:00.320
<v Speaker 1>everything that's wrong with American</v>
<v Speaker 1>foreign policy.</v>

19
00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:05.510
<v Speaker 1>Documentary director Robert Greenwald,</v>
<v Speaker 1>doing roughly the same thing on MSNBC</v>

20
00:01:05.511 --> 00:01:09.830
<v Speaker 1>and finally former presidential</v>
<v Speaker 1>candidate Howard Dean speaking his mind</v>

21
00:01:09.831 --> 00:01:14.030
<v Speaker 1>on real time with Bill Maher.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I bet you if you looked at a cross</v>

22
00:01:14.031 --> 00:01:16.220
<v Speaker 1>section of the tea party and people</v>
<v Speaker 1>would go to see this movie,</v>

23
00:01:16.221 --> 00:01:19.010
<v Speaker 1>there's a lot of intersection I could go</v>
<v Speaker 1>on for a while,</v>

24
00:01:19.011 --> 00:01:22.520
<v Speaker 1>but I think you get the point.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A lot of high profile partisan liberal</v>

25
00:01:22.521 --> 00:01:26.690
<v Speaker 1>viewers did not enjoy what they</v>
<v Speaker 1>interpreted to be blatantly pro war</v>

26
00:01:26.691 --> 00:01:30.110
<v Speaker 1>propaganda movie.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The movie made by a man whose personal</v>

27
00:01:30.111 --> 00:01:33.830
<v Speaker 1>politics already seems to run counter to</v>
<v Speaker 1>dos who stand against the film.</v>

28
00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:37.270
<v Speaker 1>When somebody does not do the job,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we've got to let them go</v>

29
00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:42.100
<v Speaker 1>and then he would have therefore</v>
<v Speaker 1>naturally and consciously made a movie</v>

30
00:01:42.101 --> 00:01:46.480
<v Speaker 1>that shows audiences each simplistic and</v>
<v Speaker 1>glorified version of the war were just</v>

31
00:01:46.481 --> 00:01:47.500
<v Speaker 1>odd to say the least.</v>

32
00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:51.370
<v Speaker 1>This that would be completely out of</v>
<v Speaker 1>character for clinic sweet and director</v>

33
00:01:51.371 --> 00:01:55.030
<v Speaker 1>who has a record of making nuanced and</v>
<v Speaker 1>often openminded films.</v>

34
00:01:55.330 --> 00:01:59.590
<v Speaker 1>The glamorizing negritude is killing in</v>
<v Speaker 1>western movies addressing gender and</v>

35
00:01:59.591 --> 00:02:03.790
<v Speaker 1>class issues for women in sports.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You minimizing Japanese soldiers during</v>

36
00:02:03.791 --> 00:02:06.820
<v Speaker 1>the Second World War.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Tackling the corrupt criminal justice</v>

37
00:02:06.821 --> 00:02:10.660
<v Speaker 1>system of the early 20th century and</v>
<v Speaker 1>being criticized by some conservatives</v>

38
00:02:10.661 --> 00:02:14.230
<v Speaker 1>for gramitizing to homosexual private</v>
<v Speaker 1>life of FBI director,</v>

39
00:02:14.231 --> 00:02:17.200
<v Speaker 1>Edgar Hoover,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not you accurately point out the true</v>

40
00:02:17.201 --> 00:02:20.680
<v Speaker 1>message of American sniper.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We can make use of literary theorist</v>

41
00:02:20.681 --> 00:02:25.120
<v Speaker 1>Kenneth Burke's cluster analysis method,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which attempts to seek out the film's</v>

42
00:02:25.121 --> 00:02:29.530
<v Speaker 1>most important recurring terms with the</v>
<v Speaker 1>positive god term on the one hand and a</v>

43
00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:33.270
<v Speaker 1>counter acting devil term on the other</v>
<v Speaker 1>in between floats,</v>

44
00:02:33.271 --> 00:02:36.100
<v Speaker 1>subordinate terms that align with either</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the main terms,</v>

45
00:02:36.101 --> 00:02:38.800
<v Speaker 1>but that can change their value as the</v>
<v Speaker 1>story progresses.</v>

46
00:02:39.070 --> 00:02:42.400
<v Speaker 1>But before we get into any of that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's start by taking a closer look at</v>

47
00:02:42.401 --> 00:02:45.880
<v Speaker 1>our gods term.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In order to truly understand the</v>

48
00:02:45.881 --> 00:02:48.670
<v Speaker 1>character of Chris Kyle and why he does</v>
<v Speaker 1>what he does,</v>

49
00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:51.730
<v Speaker 1>we first need to examine how his value</v>
<v Speaker 1>system works.</v>

50
00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:54.610
<v Speaker 1>Traveling back to is you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If we can observe how is strict</v>

51
00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:58.210
<v Speaker 1>upbringing in a highly conservative</v>
<v Speaker 1>household late the foundations for the</v>

52
00:02:58.211 --> 00:03:00.940
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He would later from his father stoic</v>

53
00:03:00.941 --> 00:03:04.630
<v Speaker 1>sheepdog philosophy of protecting the</v>
<v Speaker 1>defense lists from all this evil in the</v>

54
00:03:04.631 --> 00:03:07.090
<v Speaker 1>world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Two sermons about God's plan for his</v>

55
00:03:07.091 --> 00:03:09.790
<v Speaker 1>believers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yet unknown path to glory.</v>

56
00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:13.280
<v Speaker 1>And lastly a lesson in perseverance.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Get back here.</v>

57
00:03:16.690 --> 00:03:18.220
<v Speaker 1>You don't ever leave your rifle in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>dirt.</v>

58
00:03:19.450 --> 00:03:21.850
<v Speaker 1>Yes sir.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All these teachings work for her to</v>

59
00:03:21.851 --> 00:03:24.430
<v Speaker 1>concept with family,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to protect it from danger,</v>

60
00:03:24.490 --> 00:03:29.350
<v Speaker 1>to believe in God's plan for his glory</v>
<v Speaker 1>and to never abandoned one's duty</v>

61
00:03:29.351 --> 00:03:33.010
<v Speaker 1>towards it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's this value system to cal carries</v>

62
00:03:33.011 --> 00:03:36.680
<v Speaker 1>with them into adulthood and that after</v>
<v Speaker 1>perhaps having laid dormant for some</v>

63
00:03:36.681 --> 00:03:40.660
<v Speaker 1>time miss reawakened by the terrorist</v>
<v Speaker 1>attacks on the American embassies,</v>

64
00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:45.100
<v Speaker 1>cows,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wards and emotional reaction indicating</v>

65
00:03:45.101 --> 00:03:49.900
<v Speaker 1>that his notion of family has extended</v>
<v Speaker 1>into the nation as family and attack on</v>

66
00:03:49.901 --> 00:03:52.960
<v Speaker 1>the nation is indirectly and attack on</v>
<v Speaker 1>his own family,</v>

67
00:03:53.350 --> 00:03:57.550
<v Speaker 1>which pushes him into joining the navy</v>
<v Speaker 1>seals who like many other military units</v>

68
00:03:57.610 --> 00:04:00.850
<v Speaker 1>actively try to form a tight knit group</v>
<v Speaker 1>of non quitters</v>

69
00:04:01.380 --> 00:04:05.680
<v Speaker 2>for the faint of heart there they wash</v>
<v Speaker 2>out the quit on my most men don't quit,</v>

70
00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:08.400
<v Speaker 1>so Chris,</v>
<v Speaker 1>despite has apparent old age,</v>

71
00:04:08.401 --> 00:04:11.610
<v Speaker 1>stays faithful to his beliefs and</v>
<v Speaker 1>doesn't quit and this other newly</v>

72
00:04:11.611 --> 00:04:14.670
<v Speaker 1>perceived family.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Another instance where Chris's values</v>

73
00:04:14.671 --> 00:04:18.330
<v Speaker 1>influence events is when he manages to</v>
<v Speaker 1>grab the interest of his future wife</v>

74
00:04:18.331 --> 00:04:22.140
<v Speaker 1>Taya after he denounced as a fellow seal</v>
<v Speaker 1>for cheating and quitting on his</v>

75
00:04:22.141 --> 00:04:24.670
<v Speaker 1>marriage.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Kristen say a shared love for family.</v>

76
00:04:24.671 --> 00:04:28.170
<v Speaker 1>You make sure subsequent relationship</v>
<v Speaker 1>grow and things seem to be shaping up to</v>

77
00:04:28.171 --> 00:04:32.340
<v Speaker 1>cal's divine plan for awhile until one</v>
<v Speaker 1>fateful September morning,</v>

78
00:04:32.650 --> 00:04:33.483
<v Speaker 2>no</v>

79
00:04:43.600 --> 00:04:47.290
<v Speaker 1>wars devil term that slowly starts to</v>
<v Speaker 1>take control over at Kyle's family</v>

80
00:04:47.291 --> 00:04:49.530
<v Speaker 1>values.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The first value that's bootsy that's</v>

81
00:04:49.540 --> 00:04:52.120
<v Speaker 1>asked is a sheepdog notion of protecting</v>
<v Speaker 1>family,</v>

82
00:04:52.240 --> 00:04:54.850
<v Speaker 1>which as we've seen consists of three</v>
<v Speaker 1>layers.</v>

83
00:04:55.240 --> 00:04:58.780
<v Speaker 1>His family at home is military family</v>
<v Speaker 1>and his country.</v>

84
00:04:59.140 --> 00:05:02.650
<v Speaker 1>As Cruz is deployed to Iraq,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we see him excelling in his role on the</v>

85
00:05:02.651 --> 00:05:06.460
<v Speaker 1>battlefield as an overwatch sniper,</v>
<v Speaker 1>keeping the evils of war from his</v>

86
00:05:06.461 --> 00:05:09.220
<v Speaker 1>military family,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as well as keeping it as far away as</v>

87
00:05:09.221 --> 00:05:11.290
<v Speaker 1>possible from his own direct family.</v>

88
00:05:14.640 --> 00:05:17.390
<v Speaker 2>The call home was supposed to go,</v>

89
00:05:18.220 --> 00:05:20.980
<v Speaker 1>however,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he slowly finds out that it's impossible</v>

90
00:05:20.981 --> 00:05:24.400
<v Speaker 1>to do either of these things because</v>
<v Speaker 1>regardless of his extra tease as a</v>

91
00:05:24.401 --> 00:05:26.830
<v Speaker 1>sniper,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's proven to be unable to protect</v>

92
00:05:26.831 --> 00:05:30.940
<v Speaker 1>every single marine under his watch.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he also has to live with the fact</v>

93
00:05:30.941 --> 00:05:34.490
<v Speaker 1>that in order to protect his family,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's forced to destroy another.</v>

94
00:05:36.850 --> 00:05:39.700
<v Speaker 1>And even though he does manage to</v>
<v Speaker 1>protect countless of troops from</v>

95
00:05:39.701 --> 00:05:42.040
<v Speaker 1>physical harm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he can't shield them from the mental</v>

96
00:05:42.041 --> 00:05:44.290
<v Speaker 1>harm.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The war inevitably causes them as is</v>

97
00:05:44.291 --> 00:05:47.740
<v Speaker 1>exemplified when Chris runs into his</v>
<v Speaker 1>little brother who is about to return</v>

98
00:05:47.741 --> 00:05:48.580
<v Speaker 1>home from the war,</v>

99
00:05:49.820 --> 00:05:50.653
<v Speaker 2>just tired man</v>

100
00:05:53.690 --> 00:05:57.740
<v Speaker 1>cows building frustration over his</v>
<v Speaker 1>inability to protect everyone is when he</v>

101
00:05:57.741 --> 00:06:01.370
<v Speaker 1>witnesses to depths of an Iraqi family.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He vouched to protect after having</v>

102
00:06:01.371 --> 00:06:04.810
<v Speaker 1>extracted vital information from them</v>
<v Speaker 1>and thereby consciously having involved</v>

103
00:06:04.811 --> 00:06:07.250
<v Speaker 1>them into the war.</v>
<v Speaker 1>His first deployment ends those with the</v>

104
00:06:07.251 --> 00:06:11.600
<v Speaker 1>notion that war and protecting food war</v>
<v Speaker 1>inevitably makes collateral damage of</v>

105
00:06:11.601 --> 00:06:14.270
<v Speaker 1>family,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which we can see even more clearly is</v>

106
00:06:14.271 --> 00:06:18.580
<v Speaker 1>cal returns home with his feelings of</v>
<v Speaker 1>frustration and guilt gone on resolve</v>

107
00:06:18.600 --> 00:06:22.660
<v Speaker 1>that quickly becomes clear that far from</v>
<v Speaker 1>having left the war behind Chris has</v>

108
00:06:22.661 --> 00:06:26.870
<v Speaker 1>brought it home in the form of mental</v>
<v Speaker 1>trauma is developing ptsd causes him to</v>

109
00:06:26.871 --> 00:06:29.600
<v Speaker 1>become increasingly disconnected from</v>
<v Speaker 1>his family life.</v>

110
00:06:29.900 --> 00:06:33.230
<v Speaker 1>Having become absent minded,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he constantly slips back to the evils of</v>

111
00:06:33.231 --> 00:06:35.270
<v Speaker 1>the war,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the death of the rocky family.</v>

112
00:06:35.720 --> 00:06:39.570
<v Speaker 1>Perhaps the perfect metaphor for Chris's</v>
<v Speaker 1>inability to keep war and family</v>

113
00:06:39.571 --> 00:06:43.610
<v Speaker 1>separate is when he's watching American</v>
<v Speaker 1>troops getting shot by his rival sniper</v>

114
00:06:43.850 --> 00:06:47.090
<v Speaker 1>while sitting next to at Christmas tree,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the epitome of everything.</v>

115
00:06:47.091 --> 00:06:48.860
<v Speaker 1>Family,</v>
<v Speaker 1>God and peace,</v>

116
00:06:49.340 --> 00:06:53.330
<v Speaker 1>still unwilling to talk about the war.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Chrysalis does unwittingly destroying</v>

117
00:06:53.331 --> 00:06:56.710
<v Speaker 1>his own family.</v>
<v Speaker 1>His tie tries to tell him that Chris</v>

118
00:06:56.720 --> 00:06:59.180
<v Speaker 1>talk about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're not protecting me by not talking</v>

119
00:06:59.181 --> 00:07:00.590
<v Speaker 1>about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but in Kyle's mind,</v>

120
00:07:00.591 --> 00:07:03.800
<v Speaker 1>protecting through wars,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the only way of protecting both his</v>

121
00:07:03.801 --> 00:07:06.170
<v Speaker 1>direct family as well as his other</v>
<v Speaker 1>families.</v>

122
00:07:06.171 --> 00:07:06.720
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

123
00:07:06.720 --> 00:07:10.510
<v Speaker 3>not about them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's about us.</v>

124
00:07:10.760 --> 00:07:15.110
<v Speaker 1>For Chris quitting the war would mean</v>
<v Speaker 1>quitting on the navy seals or his family</v>

125
00:07:15.111 --> 00:07:17.780
<v Speaker 1>in Iraq,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is not something has value system</v>

126
00:07:17.781 --> 00:07:22.580
<v Speaker 1>allows him to do and it's why we see him</v>
<v Speaker 1>returning again and again and again.</v>

127
00:07:22.880 --> 00:07:26.930
<v Speaker 1>This no quitting mentality is supported</v>
<v Speaker 1>by his confidence and finding glory in</v>

128
00:07:26.931 --> 00:07:31.610
<v Speaker 1>God's divine plan as he carries with him</v>
<v Speaker 1>Miss Old Bible wherever he goes and he</v>

129
00:07:31.611 --> 00:07:34.140
<v Speaker 1>continuously,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's sure as tie that you to let him</v>

130
00:07:34.141 --> 00:07:34.974
<v Speaker 1>leave,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

131
00:07:35.010 --> 00:07:37.040
<v Speaker 1>What do you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's all part of the plan for Chris.</v>

132
00:07:37.041 --> 00:07:41.300
<v Speaker 1>His bath to glory is in a self perceived</v>
<v Speaker 1>crusade against the forces of evil in</v>

133
00:07:41.301 --> 00:07:43.940
<v Speaker 1>Iraq,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which seems to be why he's sporting a</v>

134
00:07:43.941 --> 00:07:47.180
<v Speaker 1>crusader cross to to you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and why he believes in the righteousness</v>

135
00:07:47.181 --> 00:07:50.960
<v Speaker 1>of the u s presence.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There we're singing God's blessing and</v>

136
00:07:50.961 --> 00:07:54.410
<v Speaker 1>Glory Dafur become associated with war,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it and family.</v>

137
00:07:54.710 --> 00:07:56.040
<v Speaker 1>However,</v>
<v Speaker 1>cal's never ending.</v>

138
00:07:56.090 --> 00:08:00.650
<v Speaker 1>Crusade becomes increasingly reckless</v>
<v Speaker 1>and vengeful over time as he sets out on</v>

139
00:08:00.651 --> 00:08:04.310
<v Speaker 1>a personal mission to find and kill the</v>
<v Speaker 1>people responsible for killing his</v>

140
00:08:04.311 --> 00:08:08.620
<v Speaker 1>fellow soldiers and Iraqi family does.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Transformation can be seen in seals</v>

141
00:08:08.630 --> 00:08:10.510
<v Speaker 1>adopting to punish her logo.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>

142
00:08:10.580 --> 00:08:13.010
<v Speaker 1>marvel,</v>
<v Speaker 1>anti hero who will do anything to get</v>

143
00:08:13.011 --> 00:08:15.380
<v Speaker 1>revenge against the people who killed</v>
<v Speaker 1>his family,</v>

144
00:08:15.920 --> 00:08:19.280
<v Speaker 1>but it's also noticeable in cals</v>
<v Speaker 1>behavior at home where he's now</v>

145
00:08:19.281 --> 00:08:22.240
<v Speaker 1>completely disconnected from his family</v>
<v Speaker 1>leading to tie,</v>

146
00:08:22.310 --> 00:08:23.480
<v Speaker 1>giving him an ultimatum.</v>

147
00:08:23.810 --> 00:08:28.810
<v Speaker 3>If you leave again,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the puppy here when you get back,</v>

148
00:08:29.350 --> 00:08:33.160
<v Speaker 1>not only does cal's plan and obsession</v>
<v Speaker 1>almost destroy what he holds most dear.</v>

149
00:08:33.161 --> 00:08:35.800
<v Speaker 1>It also comes at a cost of two of his</v>
<v Speaker 1>friends,</v>

150
00:08:36.130 --> 00:08:39.730
<v Speaker 1>one of them whose best friend Mark Lee.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It would be preacher turned.</v>

151
00:08:39.731 --> 00:08:43.380
<v Speaker 1>Soldier was slowly becoming</v>
<v Speaker 1>disillusioned by the war and Carl's</v>

152
00:08:43.381 --> 00:08:45.970
<v Speaker 1>dogmatic interpretation of God's blend</v>
<v Speaker 1>for glory.</v>

153
00:08:46.240 --> 00:08:49.060
<v Speaker 1>This is shown through to strongly worded</v>
<v Speaker 1>anti war letter.</v>

154
00:08:49.061 --> 00:08:50.740
<v Speaker 1>He leaves behind my question.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

155
00:08:51.470 --> 00:08:54.910
<v Speaker 3>it's one that's glory fade away and</v>
<v Speaker 3>become a rock look.</v>

156
00:08:55.690 --> 00:08:58.440
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and then just to tie it means by which</v>

157
00:08:58.740 --> 00:09:01.860
<v Speaker 3>consumes what completely.</v>

158
00:09:02.690 --> 00:09:06.740
<v Speaker 1>It's a message of the glorification that</v>
<v Speaker 1>only really hits cow when he's finally</v>

159
00:09:06.741 --> 00:09:10.310
<v Speaker 1>got the chance to take up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Mustafa you sear in sniper that started</v>

160
00:09:10.311 --> 00:09:12.800
<v Speaker 1>his crusade against orders to stand</v>
<v Speaker 1>down.</v>

161
00:09:12.801 --> 00:09:16.820
<v Speaker 1>Chris chooses to pull the trigger</v>
<v Speaker 1>instead to protect his fellow soldiers,</v>

162
00:09:16.821 --> 00:09:21.821
<v Speaker 1>to show his no quitter mentality and</v>
<v Speaker 1>most of all to finally find catharsis in</v>

163
00:09:22.041 --> 00:09:25.760
<v Speaker 1>his crusade or Ms Bland for glory.</v>
<v Speaker 1>As we staff our false.</v>

164
00:09:25.761 --> 00:09:27.890
<v Speaker 1>However,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's no great celebration.</v>

165
00:09:28.040 --> 00:09:30.830
<v Speaker 1>No Real Catharsis for Chris as his</v>
<v Speaker 1>friends speaks.</v>

166
00:09:30.831 --> 00:09:32.870
<v Speaker 1>Two words,</v>
<v Speaker 1>mission accomplished,</v>

167
00:09:33.140 --> 00:09:37.160
<v Speaker 1>perhaps referring to George W.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Bush infamous speech after the initial</v>

168
00:09:37.161 --> 00:09:39.260
<v Speaker 1>vision of Iraq had ended.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Of course,</v>

169
00:09:39.290 --> 00:09:41.240
<v Speaker 1>the war was far from over.</v>
<v Speaker 1>At that point,</v>

170
00:09:41.270 --> 00:09:44.170
<v Speaker 1>there was no real nuance spot out plan</v>
<v Speaker 1>for postwar,</v>

171
00:09:44.210 --> 00:09:47.150
<v Speaker 1>our rack giving,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the false sense of catharsis.</v>

172
00:09:47.540 --> 00:09:50.060
<v Speaker 1>Something similar happens after kyle</v>
<v Speaker 1>takes that shot.</v>

173
00:09:50.240 --> 00:09:53.490
<v Speaker 1>Their position now exposed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Kyle's team is quickly surrounded by and</v>

174
00:09:53.491 --> 00:09:57.350
<v Speaker 1>surgeons as they face certain death,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you realize is that his crusade will</v>

175
00:09:57.351 --> 00:09:59.870
<v Speaker 1>ultimately be the end of him and his</v>
<v Speaker 1>family.</v>

176
00:09:59.930 --> 00:10:02.270
<v Speaker 1>As he finally decides it's time to go</v>
<v Speaker 1>home.</v>

177
00:10:02.370 --> 00:10:03.203
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm ready.</v>

178
00:10:05.040 --> 00:10:06.150
<v Speaker 3>I'm ready to go home.</v>

179
00:10:06.790 --> 00:10:09.670
<v Speaker 1>By sheer luck,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the team manages to escape then surgeons</v>

180
00:10:09.671 --> 00:10:13.390
<v Speaker 1>for sand storm.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A perfect metaphor for the fog of war,</v>

181
00:10:13.420 --> 00:10:17.350
<v Speaker 1>perhaps signifying Chris struggling with</v>
<v Speaker 1>his internal moral consciousness,</v>

182
00:10:17.800 --> 00:10:22.540
<v Speaker 1>his struggle between family and war,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's here where he visually quits on</v>

183
00:10:22.541 --> 00:10:26.500
<v Speaker 1>both the war and dogmatism of his</v>
<v Speaker 1>father's upbringing by leaving his rifle</v>

184
00:10:26.501 --> 00:10:28.030
<v Speaker 1>in the dirt.</v>
<v Speaker 1>However,</v>

185
00:10:28.031 --> 00:10:30.880
<v Speaker 1>even after having,</v>
<v Speaker 1>via aligned with his family and taking</v>

186
00:10:30.881 --> 00:10:35.140
<v Speaker 1>up a healthier sheepdog role by helping</v>
<v Speaker 1>disabled and traumatized veterans deal</v>

187
00:10:35.141 --> 00:10:37.350
<v Speaker 1>with their experiences,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Chris too,</v>

188
00:10:37.400 --> 00:10:39.790
<v Speaker 1>we would ultimately become a victim of</v>
<v Speaker 1>the war.</v>

189
00:10:40.570 --> 00:10:44.980
<v Speaker 1>So I would argue that far from being a</v>
<v Speaker 1>pro war pro neoconservative propaganda</v>

190
00:10:44.981 --> 00:10:47.560
<v Speaker 1>movie,</v>
<v Speaker 1>American sniper can much more accurately</v>

191
00:10:47.561 --> 00:10:50.380
<v Speaker 1>be described as an anti war movie.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The pay thing.</v>

192
00:10:50.381 --> 00:10:54.100
<v Speaker 1>It's destructive nature towards family,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whether it'd be to cal family,</v>

193
00:10:54.101 --> 00:10:56.850
<v Speaker 1>to navy seal brotherhood,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or even the family.</v>

194
00:10:56.851 --> 00:10:57.790
<v Speaker 1>You'll rival sniper.</v>

195
00:10:57.790 --> 00:11:02.590
<v Speaker 1>Mustafa more always in fates the home</v>
<v Speaker 1>and corrupts and destroys it from event</v>

196
00:11:03.190 --> 00:11:05.860
<v Speaker 1>director Clint Eastwood made a film</v>
<v Speaker 1>condemning the war,</v>

197
00:11:05.861 --> 00:11:08.800
<v Speaker 1>not the warrior,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and criticizing the neoconservative</v>

198
00:11:08.801 --> 00:11:12.280
<v Speaker 1>Baltic step resorted to it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>American sniper is not a direct</v>

199
00:11:12.281 --> 00:11:15.190
<v Speaker 1>adaptation of Chris Gal's life and it</v>
<v Speaker 1>isn't meant to be.</v>

200
00:11:15.670 --> 00:11:19.930
<v Speaker 1>These would seem serve roughly adapted a</v>
<v Speaker 1>story to make you broader statement to</v>

201
00:11:19.931 --> 00:11:23.170
<v Speaker 1>make a film that respects and puts</v>
<v Speaker 1>emphasis on its veterans.</v>

202
00:11:23.590 --> 00:11:27.370
<v Speaker 1>One that helps us understand their</v>
<v Speaker 1>experience and one that asks us not to</v>

203
00:11:27.371 --> 00:11:30.610
<v Speaker 1>forget their struggle in the words of</v>
<v Speaker 1>Bradley Cooper,</v>

204
00:11:30.820 --> 00:11:34.060
<v Speaker 1>for me and for Clinton,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this movie was always a character study</v>

205
00:11:34.061 --> 00:11:37.480
<v Speaker 1>about what the plate is for a soldier.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If it's not this movie,</v>

206
00:11:37.481 --> 00:11:41.350
<v Speaker 1>I hope to God another move he will come</v>
<v Speaker 1>out where it will shed light on the fact</v>

207
00:11:41.351 --> 00:11:45.070
<v Speaker 1>of what service men and women have to go</v>
<v Speaker 1>through and that we need to pay</v>

208
00:11:45.071 --> 00:11:47.860
<v Speaker 1>attention to her.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yvette's it doesn't go any further than</v>

209
00:11:47.861 --> 00:11:50.050
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not a political discussion about</v>

210
00:11:50.051 --> 00:11:53.260
<v Speaker 1>war even.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a discussion about the reality and</v>

211
00:11:53.261 --> 00:11:55.420
<v Speaker 1>the reality is that people were coming</v>
<v Speaker 1>home.</v>

212
00:11:55.810 --> 00:11:57.070
<v Speaker 1>We have to take care of them.</v>

213
00:12:05.870 --> 00:12:08.060
<v Speaker 1>All right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Thank you all so much for watching and</v>

214
00:12:08.090 --> 00:12:10.340
<v Speaker 1>seeing how much hate American sniper</v>
<v Speaker 1>received.</v>

215
00:12:10.341 --> 00:12:12.200
<v Speaker 1>They just had to express my views of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>movie.</v>

216
00:12:12.201 --> 00:12:12.830
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

217
00:12:12.830 --> 00:12:14.960
<v Speaker 1>I hope this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this video clear things up a little bit.</v>

218
00:12:15.280 --> 00:12:17.390
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want to thank Danielle Key Mirman for</v>

219
00:12:17.391 --> 00:12:20.240
<v Speaker 1>his thesis on partisan reception of</v>
<v Speaker 1>American sniper,</v>

220
00:12:20.270 --> 00:12:22.280
<v Speaker 1>which was a big influence for this</v>
<v Speaker 1>video,</v>

221
00:12:22.610 --> 00:12:25.550
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Dell's extensively into how and why</v>

222
00:12:25.551 --> 00:12:29.120
<v Speaker 1>political audiences came to such a</v>
<v Speaker 1>widely different interpretation of the</v>

223
00:12:29.121 --> 00:12:30.470
<v Speaker 1>film.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Lastly,</v>

224
00:12:30.471 --> 00:12:33.140
<v Speaker 1>if you want to help us out and sustain</v>
<v Speaker 1>this channel,</v>

225
00:12:33.170 --> 00:12:36.440

<v Speaker 1>while you can leave as a dollar.</v>

226
00:12:37.010 --> 00:12:39.110
<v Speaker 1>Anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 1>thank you all again for watching happy</v>

227
00:12:39.111 --> 00:12:42.800
<v Speaker 1>4th of July to our American viewers and</v>
