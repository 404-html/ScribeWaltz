00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:03.510
<v Speaker 1>A big thank you to squarespace for</v>
<v Speaker 1>sponsoring this video.</v>

2
00:00:04.190 --> 00:00:08.390
<v Speaker 2>It's not easy butchering people's hard</v>
<v Speaker 2>work physically and mentally.</v>

3
00:00:08.391 --> 00:00:11.630
<v Speaker 2>I don't think people realize you need to</v>
<v Speaker 2>vent.</v>

4
00:00:12.260 --> 00:00:17.180
<v Speaker 1>One of the more fascinating aspects of</v>
<v Speaker 1>David fincher's mind hunter is that it</v>

5
00:00:17.181 --> 00:00:21.140
<v Speaker 1>is not just a detective thriller.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Dad Explores the psychology of serial</v>

6
00:00:21.141 --> 00:00:25.370
<v Speaker 1>killers but at it also explores why we</v>
<v Speaker 1>are so fascinated by them,</v>

7
00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:28.760
<v Speaker 1>why we are drawn to the dark,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why we are captivated,</v>

8
00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:33.650
<v Speaker 1>haunted and teased by the unthinkable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Although collecting serial killer</v>

9
00:00:33.651 --> 00:00:37.310
<v Speaker 1>memorabilia or writing them letters is a</v>
<v Speaker 1>fringe activity.</v>

10
00:00:37.311 --> 00:00:41.720
<v Speaker 1>Serial killers in habits of prominence</v>
<v Speaker 1>position within both our nonfictional</v>

11
00:00:41.721 --> 00:00:46.100
<v Speaker 1>and fictional popular culture,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people are glued to coverage of real</v>

12
00:00:46.101 --> 00:00:49.210
<v Speaker 1>life serial killers such as Ted Bundy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Eileen wound,</v>

13
00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:53.750
<v Speaker 1>and Jeffrey Dahmer who all have their</v>
<v Speaker 1>own documentaries and films.</v>

14
00:00:53.880 --> 00:00:57.720
<v Speaker 3>I now present to you Jeffrey Dahmer in</v>
<v Speaker 3>his command performance.</v>

15
00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:03.890
<v Speaker 1>These real killers together with popular</v>
<v Speaker 1>fictional depictions of serial killers</v>

16
00:01:03.891 --> 00:01:08.070
<v Speaker 1>such as Hannibal Lecter or dexter and</v>
<v Speaker 1>John Doe demonstrate how eager the</v>

17
00:01:08.071 --> 00:01:13.071
<v Speaker 1>public is to learn more about him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The way in which mind center treats and</v>

18
00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:16.110
<v Speaker 1>thesises with accurate representations</v>
<v Speaker 1>of real life.</v>

19
00:01:16.111 --> 00:01:20.820
<v Speaker 1>Serial killers was described by review</v>
<v Speaker 1>as serial killer fence surface.</v>

20
00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:23.640
<v Speaker 1>Serial killers are this feud in our</v>
<v Speaker 1>culture,</v>

21
00:01:23.641 --> 00:01:25.770
<v Speaker 1>both as despicable monsters,</v>

22
00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:28.010
<v Speaker 3>monster,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

23
00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:30.050
<v Speaker 3>I think we can all agree</v>

24
00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:33.110
<v Speaker 1>and fascinating cool celebrities.</v>

25
00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:37.970
<v Speaker 3>You would really turn down the chance to</v>
<v Speaker 3>meet Richard Speck is almost up there.</v>

26
00:01:37.971 --> 00:01:41.340
<v Speaker 3>They're advancing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Or maybe he'll give you an autograph,</v>

27
00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:44.560
<v Speaker 1>but why is this?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why can't we get enough of them?</v>

28
00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:49.510
<v Speaker 1>The first episode of tend to suggest</v>
<v Speaker 1>that there is a connection between the</v>

29
00:01:49.511 --> 00:01:53.950
<v Speaker 1>behavior of these killers and the</v>
<v Speaker 1>broader state of culture and society,</v>

30
00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:57.300
<v Speaker 3>democracy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Spanish style.</v>

31
00:01:57.380 --> 00:02:01.730
<v Speaker 3>What are</v>
<v Speaker 3>just a response to turmoil?</v>

32
00:02:02.110 --> 00:02:04.700
<v Speaker 3>The government used to be symbolically a</v>
<v Speaker 3>parental institution.</v>

33
00:02:06.470 --> 00:02:09.080
<v Speaker 3>It's a free for all.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The world barely makes any sense.</v>

34
00:02:09.081 --> 00:02:10.700
<v Speaker 3>So it follows the crime doesn't either.</v>

35
00:02:11.350 --> 00:02:15.910
<v Speaker 1>Is that what we see in serial killers?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Are they an extreme representation of</v>

36
00:02:15.911 --> 00:02:19.150
<v Speaker 1>our broader society for which we are all</v>
<v Speaker 1>responsible?</v>

37
00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:22.120
<v Speaker 1>Of course,</v>
<v Speaker 1>holden and bill soon find out that</v>

38
00:02:22.121 --> 00:02:26.920
<v Speaker 1>serial killers are not crazy rampant</v>
<v Speaker 1>aberrational parallels to the crazy</v>

39
00:02:26.921 --> 00:02:29.440
<v Speaker 1>chaotic culture of the sixties and</v>
<v Speaker 1>seventies</v>

40
00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:32.260
<v Speaker 3>that's that friends eat.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know what the hell is</v>

41
00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:37.900
<v Speaker 3>meticulous,</v>
<v Speaker 3>highly intelligent.</v>

42
00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:43.360
<v Speaker 1>The scholars can be intelligent and</v>
<v Speaker 1>organized with very clear motivations</v>

43
00:02:43.361 --> 00:02:45.940
<v Speaker 1>for their quote unquote work such as</v>
<v Speaker 1>sex,</v>

44
00:02:45.941 --> 00:02:47.680
<v Speaker 1>power and domination.</v>

45
00:02:48.270 --> 00:02:52.800
<v Speaker 2>I'm just saying people who hunt other</v>
<v Speaker 2>people for a vocation,</v>

46
00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:55.620
<v Speaker 2>all we want to talk about is what it's</v>
<v Speaker 2>like</v>

47
00:02:55.910 --> 00:02:58.460
<v Speaker 1>this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If serial killers are an extreme</v>

48
00:02:58.461 --> 00:03:02.140
<v Speaker 1>representation of human culture,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they are so in the way.</v>

49
00:03:02.141 --> 00:03:06.700
<v Speaker 1>Historian Carsten Fisher describes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he argues that serial killers often</v>

50
00:03:06.701 --> 00:03:09.590
<v Speaker 1>developed in the same way as human</v>
<v Speaker 1>civilizations,</v>

51
00:03:09.591 --> 00:03:12.610
<v Speaker 1>do civilizations in their fields,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the unknown,</v>

52
00:03:12.611 --> 00:03:16.620
<v Speaker 1>half need to organize,</v>
<v Speaker 1>control and dominate nature and other</v>

53
00:03:16.630 --> 00:03:19.300
<v Speaker 1>people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Therefore first domesticating and</v>

54
00:03:19.301 --> 00:03:22.600
<v Speaker 1>killing animals and so later in</v>
<v Speaker 1>sloughing and it's killing all the</v>

55
00:03:22.601 --> 00:03:24.530
<v Speaker 1>humans.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just a serial killer,</v>

56
00:03:24.531 --> 00:03:28.930
<v Speaker 1>start with torturing and killing animals</v>
<v Speaker 1>before they move on to people.</v>

57
00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:32.040
<v Speaker 3>So then it became dogs and cats</v>
<v Speaker 3>strangling them,</v>

58
00:03:32.041 --> 00:03:34.530
<v Speaker 3>burying them in the backyard.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Hold on.</v>

59
00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:36.113
<v Speaker 3>Sorry.</v>

60
00:03:37.070 --> 00:03:40.920
<v Speaker 1>On an individual level.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This theory is also reflected by</v>

61
00:03:40.990 --> 00:03:44.960
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible] concept of the shadow self.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You argue stairs.</v>

62
00:03:44.980 --> 00:03:48.740
<v Speaker 1>We repress primitive,</v>
<v Speaker 1>negative socially or religiously</v>

63
00:03:48.741 --> 00:03:52.820
<v Speaker 1>depreciate as human emotions and</v>
<v Speaker 1>impulses like sexual loss,</v>

64
00:03:52.880 --> 00:03:54.710
<v Speaker 1>power striving,</v>
<v Speaker 1>selfishness,</v>

65
00:03:54.711 --> 00:03:58.730
<v Speaker 1>creeds and anger or rage into our own</v>
<v Speaker 1>consciousness.</v>

66
00:03:58.780 --> 00:04:00.380
<v Speaker 1>Our dark side,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so to speak,</v>

67
00:04:00.620 --> 00:04:04.550
<v Speaker 1>the shadow self is to counterpoint to</v>
<v Speaker 1>what you called a persona,</v>

68
00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:08.360
<v Speaker 1>which is our conscious ego.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How we see ourselves and represent</v>

69
00:04:08.361 --> 00:04:09.860
<v Speaker 1>ourselves to watch the worlds.</v>

70
00:04:10.570 --> 00:04:14.210
<v Speaker 3>That's by Erving Goffman.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He posits that life was like theater.</v>

71
00:04:14.690 --> 00:04:19.280
<v Speaker 3>We tailor ourselves to fit the parts</v>
<v Speaker 3>that were playing in a social</v>

72
00:04:19.281 --> 00:04:20.320
<v Speaker 3>interaction.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Awesome.</v>

73
00:04:20.380 --> 00:04:21.290
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>To put performance,</v>

74
00:04:21.291 --> 00:04:24.670
<v Speaker 3>there's an onstage area where</v>
<v Speaker 3>individuals are actress as the case may</v>

75
00:04:24.671 --> 00:04:29.671
<v Speaker 3>be appear before the origins,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I must be backstage hidden private</v>

76
00:04:30.531 --> 00:04:33.180
<v Speaker 3>area where individuals can truly be</v>
<v Speaker 3>themselves.</v>

77
00:04:33.181 --> 00:04:33.950
<v Speaker 3>Of course,</v>
<v Speaker 3>emily,</v>

78
00:04:33.950 --> 00:04:37.580
<v Speaker 1>I argued that it's mine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Tinter explosive notion that this is why</v>

79
00:04:37.581 --> 00:04:42.581
<v Speaker 1>we are fascinated by serial killers</v>
<v Speaker 1>because we seen them extreme versions of</v>

80
00:04:42.801 --> 00:04:47.110
<v Speaker 1>personality traits that are part of us,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but as we repress into our own</v>

81
00:04:47.111 --> 00:04:50.360
<v Speaker 1>consciousness that are part of our</v>
<v Speaker 1>shadow selves,</v>

82
00:04:50.630 --> 00:04:54.770
<v Speaker 1>the series primary Dastis to the</v>
<v Speaker 1>character of Holden Ford.</v>

83
00:04:55.040 --> 00:04:58.460
<v Speaker 1>In the early episodes we primarily see</v>
<v Speaker 1>Holden's persona.</v>

84
00:04:58.520 --> 00:05:00.320
<v Speaker 1>He seems smart,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that humble,</v>

85
00:05:00.350 --> 00:05:03.410
<v Speaker 1>idealistic with a real drive to do</v>
<v Speaker 1>goods.</v>

86
00:05:03.740 --> 00:05:05.810
<v Speaker 3>You sure you want me doing that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're smart,</v>

87
00:05:05.900 --> 00:05:08.510
<v Speaker 3>you're idealistic,</v>
<v Speaker 3>more than a little sensitive,</v>

88
00:05:09.190 --> 00:05:10.023
<v Speaker 3>they're going to love you.</v>

89
00:05:12.490 --> 00:05:15.520
<v Speaker 1>However,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he already mentioned Sitek that he will</v>

90
00:05:15.521 --> 00:05:18.340
<v Speaker 1>later use in his interviews with serial</v>
<v Speaker 1>killers,</v>

91
00:05:19.060 --> 00:05:21.670
<v Speaker 1>try understanding him instead of trying</v>
<v Speaker 1>to dominate,</v>

92
00:05:22.940 --> 00:05:25.910
<v Speaker 3>look for common ground,</v>
<v Speaker 3>find calming down.</v>

93
00:05:26.760 --> 00:05:30.090
<v Speaker 1>Because of this very slowly over the</v>
<v Speaker 1>course of the season,</v>

94
00:05:30.091 --> 00:05:33.150
<v Speaker 1>due to his extensive interactions with</v>
<v Speaker 1>these killers,</v>

95
00:05:33.180 --> 00:05:36.570
<v Speaker 1>personality traits off his shadow self</v>
<v Speaker 1>come forwards,</v>

96
00:05:36.810 --> 00:05:40.770
<v Speaker 1>traits such as envy and fucked up views</v>
<v Speaker 1>of sex and women,</v>

97
00:05:41.040 --> 00:05:43.470
<v Speaker 1>which he claims is just an interview</v>
<v Speaker 1>technique,</v>

98
00:05:43.471 --> 00:05:47.160
<v Speaker 1>but it seems fairly much connectors to</v>
<v Speaker 1>the state of this relationship.</v>

99
00:05:48.240 --> 00:05:53.240
<v Speaker 3>What gave you the right to take eight</v>
<v Speaker 3>right consent of the world?</v>

100
00:05:55.320 --> 00:05:58.610
<v Speaker 3>Some of them looked pretty good.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You would think you were depriving the</v>

101
00:05:58.611 --> 00:05:59.444
<v Speaker 3>rest of us</v>

102
00:06:00.610 --> 00:06:03.790
<v Speaker 1>while also becoming more arrogant and</v>
<v Speaker 1>power hungry.</v>

103
00:06:04.290 --> 00:06:05.580
<v Speaker 3>You think,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know what you're doing with this</v>

104
00:06:05.581 --> 00:06:08.700
<v Speaker 3>principal's office bullshit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is what I do with violent</v>

105
00:06:08.701 --> 00:06:10.470
<v Speaker 3>offenders.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Only much better.</v>

106
00:06:10.610 --> 00:06:15.380
<v Speaker 1>Two CDs in contrast in episode three he</v>
<v Speaker 1>is celebrating a successful case like</v>

107
00:06:15.381 --> 00:06:17.450
<v Speaker 1>this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Thank you for acknowledging what my</v>

108
00:06:17.451 --> 00:06:22.451
<v Speaker 1>partner bill and I are doing</v>
<v Speaker 1>and for embracing that.</v>

109
00:06:22.671 --> 00:06:23.900
<v Speaker 1>If we all work together,</v>

110
00:06:25.210 --> 00:06:28.990
<v Speaker 3>we can venture into the blackest night</v>
<v Speaker 3>and shine a light on the darkness.</v>

111
00:06:29.340 --> 00:06:32.070
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>an episode 10 it is a different story.</v>

112
00:06:35.010 --> 00:06:37.220
<v Speaker 3>I don't think I'm speaking at an</v>
<v Speaker 3>attorney or when I say I.</v>

113
00:06:41.140 --> 00:06:44.050
<v Speaker 1>However,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have heard some people suggest as</v>

114
00:06:44.051 --> 00:06:47.770
<v Speaker 1>holden in the next season might become a</v>
<v Speaker 1>serial killer himself.</v>

115
00:06:47.890 --> 00:06:52.090
<v Speaker 1>I think this would be too easily a plot</v>
<v Speaker 1>twist after such a slow and subtle</v>

116
00:06:52.091 --> 00:06:55.720
<v Speaker 1>transformation into a shadow self.</v>
<v Speaker 1>More importantly,</v>

117
00:06:55.721 --> 00:06:59.770
<v Speaker 1>the concept of the shadow self doesn't</v>
<v Speaker 1>mean we are all secretly murderous</v>

118
00:06:59.771 --> 00:07:02.650
<v Speaker 1>psychopath.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Serial killers represent extreme</v>

119
00:07:02.651 --> 00:07:07.120
<v Speaker 1>versions of negative traits that normal</v>
<v Speaker 1>people would possess in a much more</v>

120
00:07:07.121 --> 00:07:11.530
<v Speaker 1>minor capacity call.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You argue stair to become once complete</v>

121
00:07:11.531 --> 00:07:14.590
<v Speaker 1>self.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The shadow self needs to be recognized,</v>

122
00:07:14.650 --> 00:07:19.650
<v Speaker 1>acknowledged and accepted as Jordan</v>
<v Speaker 1>Peterson argues this can be done to an</v>

123
00:07:19.691 --> 00:07:24.190
<v Speaker 1>intellectual exercise when you</v>
<v Speaker 1>contemplate your own capacity for evil</v>

124
00:07:24.370 --> 00:07:26.390
<v Speaker 3>and I don't think,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and this is something I did learn from</v>

125
00:07:26.391 --> 00:07:31.391
<v Speaker 3>yoga is that you cannot be a good person</v>
<v Speaker 3>until you know how much evil you contain</v>

126
00:07:32.061 --> 00:07:34.640
<v Speaker 3>within you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It is not possible and it's a very</v>

127
00:07:34.641 --> 00:07:38.990
<v Speaker 3>strange thing because you wouldn't think</v>
<v Speaker 3>that the revelation of the capacity for</v>

128
00:07:38.991 --> 00:07:43.020
<v Speaker 3>evil is a precondition for the</v>
<v Speaker 3>realization of good but I believe at</v>

129
00:07:43.030 --> 00:07:46.970
<v Speaker 3>first of all why would you be serious</v>
<v Speaker 3>enough to even attempt to pursue the</v>

130
00:07:46.971 --> 00:07:51.950
<v Speaker 3>good unless you had some sense of what</v>
<v Speaker 3>the consequence was of not doing it with</v>

131
00:07:51.951 --> 00:07:52.150
<v Speaker 3>you</v>

132
00:07:52.150 --> 00:07:55.450
<v Speaker 1>guards to hold him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He doesn't seem aware of his own shadow</v>

133
00:07:55.451 --> 00:07:59.170
<v Speaker 1>self coming forwards until possibly the</v>
<v Speaker 1>very ends of the season.</v>

134
00:07:59.770 --> 00:08:02.620
<v Speaker 1>In my opinion,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it is unclear whilst holding force</v>

135
00:08:02.621 --> 00:08:05.740
<v Speaker 1>breakdown signifies two two s clash with</v>
<v Speaker 1>Kemper.</v>

136
00:08:05.741 --> 00:08:09.280
<v Speaker 1>He might've become aware of its own</v>
<v Speaker 1>shadow self coming forwards,</v>

137
00:08:09.400 --> 00:08:12.160
<v Speaker 1>becoming a more balanced person and the</v>
<v Speaker 1>next season,</v>

138
00:08:12.550 --> 00:08:15.580
<v Speaker 1>who am I going to fuck him?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fuck police torture mutilation.</v>

139
00:08:16.880 --> 00:08:21.880
<v Speaker 1>This made you paranoid.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It could also mean that he will spin</v>

140
00:08:22.801 --> 00:08:26.460
<v Speaker 1>fruit out of control.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is Shadow self taking over a while being</v>

141
00:08:26.461 --> 00:08:29.520
<v Speaker 1>unable to catch a new serial killer on</v>
<v Speaker 1>the rice.</v>

142
00:08:29.640 --> 00:08:32.160
<v Speaker 1>My in Toronto.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We will continue to explore this</v>

143
00:08:32.161 --> 00:08:36.900
<v Speaker 1>psychology of serial killers profiling</v>
<v Speaker 1>some of the world's most famous ones,</v>

144
00:08:36.960 --> 00:08:37.720
