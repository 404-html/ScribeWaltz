1
00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:06.120
<v Speaker 1>The renowned writer and historian</v>
<v Speaker 1>William do ran,</v>

2
00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:10.110
<v Speaker 1>one stated that quote,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a great civilization is not conquered</v>

3
00:00:10.111 --> 00:00:14.130
<v Speaker 1>from without and so it has destroyed</v>
<v Speaker 1>itself from within.</v>

4
00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:23.430
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>those of you who've seen apocalypto may</v>

5
00:00:23.431 --> 00:00:28.390
<v Speaker 1>remember that the movie opens with this</v>
<v Speaker 1>exact quote and it also really shooting</v>

6
00:00:28.440 --> 00:00:32.040
<v Speaker 1>come as much of a surprise that the</v>
<v Speaker 1>mixture of Mel Gibson with a movie that</v>

7
00:00:32.041 --> 00:00:35.670
<v Speaker 1>attempts to prove Duran statement</v>
<v Speaker 1>through to fictionalize decline of the</v>

8
00:00:35.671 --> 00:00:38.730
<v Speaker 1>Mayan civilization,</v>
<v Speaker 1>was it the cause of some outbursts from</v>

9
00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:42.240
<v Speaker 1>numerous scholars?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Stephen Ben's from the University of</v>

10
00:00:42.240 --> 00:00:44.960
<v Speaker 1>Nebraska writes that quote legally</v>
<v Speaker 1>Gibson the madman.</v>

11
00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.670
<v Speaker 1>We'd give him too much of a pass.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It will be to ignore us.</v>

12
00:00:47.671 --> 00:00:50.160
<v Speaker 1>Unfortunately,</v>
<v Speaker 1>skilled participation in Hollywood</v>

13
00:00:50.161 --> 00:00:53.820
<v Speaker 1>cinema as long history as a tool for</v>
<v Speaker 1>discrimination and oppression,</v>

14
00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:57.840
<v Speaker 1>but most importantly a large chunk of</v>
<v Speaker 1>these critiques seem to culminate in a</v>

15
00:00:57.841 --> 00:01:02.400
<v Speaker 1>climax of the movie with the coming of</v>
<v Speaker 1>the capital expanders and since the city</v>

16
00:01:02.401 --> 00:01:07.401
<v Speaker 1>mayans are depicted as rotten and cruel</v>
<v Speaker 1>tracy and interprets this event as an</v>

17
00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:11.460
<v Speaker 1>offensive and racist notion that my</v>
<v Speaker 1>people were brutal to one another long</v>

18
00:01:11.461 --> 00:01:14.910
<v Speaker 1>before the arrival of Europeans and us.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They deserve that effect.</v>

19
00:01:14.911 --> 00:01:17.730
<v Speaker 1>They needed rescue.</v>
<v Speaker 1>To be honest,</v>

20
00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:20.850
<v Speaker 1>I had a hard time trying to find a</v>
<v Speaker 1>single academic article that wasn't an</v>

21
00:01:20.851 --> 00:01:24.380
<v Speaker 1>overly negative about this movie,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I figured it was about time for</v>

22
00:01:24.381 --> 00:01:28.550
<v Speaker 1>someone to change that and to do so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we need to start our analysis here.</v>

23
00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:36.020
<v Speaker 1>It's a or Honda.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Immediately introduce the audience to</v>

24
00:01:36.021 --> 00:01:38.870
<v Speaker 1>the first of the film's main themes and</v>
<v Speaker 1>values,</v>

25
00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:41.360
<v Speaker 1>which is the hunter versus hunted</v>
<v Speaker 1>relationship.</v>

26
00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:44.000
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there is a reason why this is important,</v>

27
00:01:44.001 --> 00:01:47.180
<v Speaker 1>but I'll get back to that later.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The second theme reveals itself as</v>

28
00:01:47.190 --> 00:01:50.840
<v Speaker 1>Jaeger par cuts of specific parts of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>animal and gifts them to his fellow</v>

29
00:01:50.841 --> 00:01:52.670
<v Speaker 1>hunters.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Shortly thereafter,</v>

30
00:01:52.671 --> 00:01:54.560
<v Speaker 1>they treat a part of the taper for some</v>
<v Speaker 1>fish.</v>

31
00:01:54.561 --> 00:01:57.290
<v Speaker 1>God,</v>
<v Speaker 1>by now to try passing by giving and</v>

32
00:01:57.291 --> 00:02:00.170
<v Speaker 1>sharing are shown to be integral parts</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the community's culture.</v>

33
00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:03.380
<v Speaker 1>There existed conscious respect and</v>
<v Speaker 1>gratitude for the abundance of the</v>

34
00:02:03.381 --> 00:02:05.380
<v Speaker 1>forest.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We just show them both non verbally,</v>

35
00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:08.560
<v Speaker 1>not making use of literally every part</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the team.</v>

36
00:02:10.710 --> 00:02:14.760
<v Speaker 1>Hello darkness,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my old friend and verbally.</v>

37
00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:19.560
<v Speaker 1>My little later during the nighttime</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fiesta village elder tells the story of</v>

38
00:02:19.561 --> 00:02:22.230
<v Speaker 1>the sad man who sat in the scrutiny,</v>
<v Speaker 1>never be quelled,</v>

39
00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:23.940
<v Speaker 1>however much the world would give him.</v>

40
00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:29.300
<v Speaker 2>Yeah know being at</v>
<v Speaker 2>a new gate,</v>

41
00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:33.620
<v Speaker 2>take a book.</v>

42
00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:38.710
<v Speaker 1>The theme of abundance has also extended</v>
<v Speaker 1>your parents respect for fertility.</v>

43
00:02:38.711 --> 00:02:42.010
<v Speaker 1>Present in the community.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Flint sky speaks of having produced 10</v>

44
00:02:42.011 --> 00:02:43.750
<v Speaker 1>children.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you ever pause his son?</v>

45
00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:47.110
<v Speaker 1>His wife is pregnant with her second and</v>
<v Speaker 1>the kids run a muck in the village.</v>

46
00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:50.710
<v Speaker 1>Blunted seems to be the odd one out as</v>
<v Speaker 1>he is unable to impregnate,</v>

47
00:02:50.711 --> 00:02:53.110
<v Speaker 1>his wife is due to dissatisfaction of</v>
<v Speaker 1>her mother,</v>

48
00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:57.160
<v Speaker 1>the situation which Mel Gibson then of</v>
<v Speaker 1>course utilize us to depict some 16th</v>

49
00:02:57.161 --> 00:03:02.140
<v Speaker 1>century pranking</v>
<v Speaker 1>to register our next two themes,</v>

50
00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:03.470
<v Speaker 1>family,</v>
<v Speaker 1>enjoy,</v>

51
00:03:03.490 --> 00:03:07.060
<v Speaker 1>or a piece with no real hierarchy or</v>
<v Speaker 1>class system present.</v>

52
00:03:07.061 --> 00:03:09.190
<v Speaker 1>The community seems to function as a</v>
<v Speaker 1>sort of big,</v>

53
00:03:09.191 --> 00:03:10.720
<v Speaker 1>happy family.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>

54
00:03:10.721 --> 00:03:14.290
<v Speaker 1>the first act of buck lipstick could</v>
<v Speaker 1>almost just as well be mistaken for a</v>

55
00:03:14.291 --> 00:03:17.140
<v Speaker 1>feel good comedy about jolly mind's</v>
<v Speaker 1>kicking it into jungle.</v>

56
00:03:31.850 --> 00:03:33.800
<v Speaker 1>However,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if things aren't all Hunky Dory,</v>

57
00:03:33.801 --> 00:03:36.460
<v Speaker 1>as is evidenced in introduction of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>first opposite thing,</v>

58
00:03:37.010 --> 00:03:39.520
<v Speaker 1>which is fear,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jaeger pause,</v>

59
00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:40.131
<v Speaker 1>brewery,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Budda,</v>

60
00:03:40.131 --> 00:03:43.400
<v Speaker 1>encounter with the audit tripe,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they seem scared and running away from</v>

61
00:03:43.401 --> 00:03:47.420
<v Speaker 1>something his father Flynn's skies</v>
<v Speaker 1>subsequently explains to him that fear</v>

62
00:03:47.421 --> 00:03:52.421
<v Speaker 1>is a sickness.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Unfortunately Jaguar pause,</v>

63
00:03:53.650 --> 00:03:56.170
<v Speaker 1>fear soon,</v>
<v Speaker 1>become very real as the city minds</v>

64
00:03:56.171 --> 00:04:00.160
<v Speaker 1>approach the village and in contrast to</v>
<v Speaker 1>the jelly looking hunter and gatherers,</v>

65
00:04:00.190 --> 00:04:02.930
<v Speaker 1>these mayans live grinman angry their</v>
<v Speaker 1>leaders.</v>

66
00:04:02.970 --> 00:04:07.810
<v Speaker 1>Zero Wolf is seeing using human skulls</v>
<v Speaker 1>as part of his warriors outfit as sound</v>

67
00:04:07.811 --> 00:04:11.200
<v Speaker 1>draws them near to the camp.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He orders them to split up and sneakily</v>

68
00:04:11.230 --> 00:04:14.230
<v Speaker 1>make their way inside.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It is here that it becomes obvious that</v>

69
00:04:14.231 --> 00:04:16.600
<v Speaker 1>these mines are on our hunts,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but instead of tape here,</v>

70
00:04:16.900 --> 00:04:21.900
<v Speaker 1>fellow humans are to be their prey.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Firas spread like wildfire throughout</v>

71
00:04:22.331 --> 00:04:24.230
<v Speaker 1>the villages.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Zero volts crew capture,</v>

72
00:04:24.231 --> 00:04:25.990
<v Speaker 1>kill and rape their way for you to camp.</v>

73
00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:29.680
<v Speaker 1>And as they make their way out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the surviving children are left behind.</v>

74
00:04:30.250 --> 00:04:34.540
<v Speaker 1>So at the beginning of the second act,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the themes of family love and fertility</v>

75
00:04:34.541 --> 00:04:38.350
<v Speaker 1>are replaced by repressive authority and</v>
<v Speaker 1>hateful moral indecency.</v>

76
00:04:38.760 --> 00:04:42.340
<v Speaker 1>And as soon made clear to violence and</v>
<v Speaker 1>pain are the determining factors of</v>

77
00:04:42.341 --> 00:04:45.100
<v Speaker 1>strength in the community of the city,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Mayan Warriors,</v>

78
00:04:49.080 --> 00:04:52.600
<v Speaker 1>the extend of the various contrasts</v>
<v Speaker 1>between your protagonists world and the</v>

79
00:04:52.601 --> 00:04:54.810
<v Speaker 1>world of his captors becomes especially</v>
<v Speaker 1>apparent.</v>

80
00:04:54.820 --> 00:04:57.160
<v Speaker 1>District group moves into dare part of</v>
<v Speaker 1>the jungle,</v>

81
00:04:57.450 --> 00:04:59.440
<v Speaker 1>or rather what was one part of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>jungle,</v>

82
00:04:59.870 --> 00:05:03.290
<v Speaker 1>the abundance fertility in all run</v>
<v Speaker 1>feeling of lightness of the jungle</v>

83
00:05:03.291 --> 00:05:07.040
<v Speaker 1>village or a police by scarcity in</v>
<v Speaker 1>fertility and death.</v>

84
00:05:07.160 --> 00:05:10.880
<v Speaker 1>One of the films most vital and powerful</v>
<v Speaker 1>scenes as the encounter with the girl.</v>

85
00:05:10.910 --> 00:05:14.420
<v Speaker 1>The warriors have obviously given up any</v>
<v Speaker 1>hope of helping dose contaminated,</v>

86
00:05:14.421 --> 00:05:17.930
<v Speaker 1>but what seems to be the plague as they</v>
<v Speaker 1>pushed the desperate little girl away,</v>

87
00:05:17.960 --> 00:05:20.450
<v Speaker 1>she didn't seem to become possessed by</v>
<v Speaker 1>some higher power,</v>

88
00:05:20.510 --> 00:05:23.960
<v Speaker 1>which then prophesizes the coming of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>Spaniards and the end of the Mayan</v>

89
00:05:23.961 --> 00:05:24.794
<v Speaker 1>civilization.</v>

90
00:05:27.920 --> 00:05:28.753
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>

91
00:05:33.830 --> 00:05:36.830
<v Speaker 1>According to William Doran,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the sign of a civilization is the client</v>

92
00:05:36.831 --> 00:05:40.100
<v Speaker 1>expresses itself and moral.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The gay that's a group enters the city.</v>

93
00:05:40.101 --> 00:05:43.610
<v Speaker 1>It has shown that the sense of community</v>
<v Speaker 1>and family has been replaced here by a</v>

94
00:05:43.611 --> 00:05:46.670
<v Speaker 1>lack of care for the weekend to old and</v>
<v Speaker 1>slavery,</v>

95
00:05:46.671 --> 00:05:49.310
<v Speaker 1>theft,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and of course the dehumanization of the</v>

96
00:05:49.311 --> 00:05:52.310
<v Speaker 1>human body depicted in the sacrifices to</v>
<v Speaker 1>the gods.</v>

97
00:05:52.460 --> 00:05:54.800
<v Speaker 1>Again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fear and violent at 40 are shown to be</v>

98
00:05:54.801 --> 00:05:57.590
<v Speaker 1>the determining factors of the society.</v>
<v Speaker 1>On of that,</v>

99
00:05:57.591 --> 00:06:00.560
<v Speaker 1>their leaders are conscious of this and</v>
<v Speaker 1>the abuser through dare advantage to</v>

100
00:06:00.561 --> 00:06:04.340
<v Speaker 1>rule and some theater people as is</v>
<v Speaker 1>evidenced by the preexisting knowledge</v>

101
00:06:04.341 --> 00:06:09.341
<v Speaker 1>of the coming solar eclipse,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so it makes the scape the board has set</v>

102
00:06:09.650 --> 00:06:13.510
<v Speaker 1>and the stakes are clear besides being a</v>
<v Speaker 1>personal struggle of life and death both</v>

103
00:06:13.511 --> 00:06:17.960
<v Speaker 1>for January as well as his trapped wife</v>
<v Speaker 1>and son to chase metaphorically also</v>

104
00:06:17.961 --> 00:06:21.860
<v Speaker 1>signifies a struggle between the before</v>
<v Speaker 1>mentioned opposite themes and values.</v>

105
00:06:22.220 --> 00:06:25.070
<v Speaker 1>Love versus hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>abundance versus scarcity,</v>

106
00:06:25.290 --> 00:06:28.550
<v Speaker 1>freedom versus captivity,</v>
<v Speaker 1>authority 40 versus family,</v>

107
00:06:28.760 --> 00:06:32.810
<v Speaker 1>the hunter versus hunted and of course</v>
<v Speaker 1>courage versus fear,</v>

108
00:06:33.020 --> 00:06:36.320
<v Speaker 1>and it is exactly in this last aspect in</v>
<v Speaker 1>which Jaeger par is lacking.</v>

109
00:06:36.530 --> 00:06:39.740
<v Speaker 1>After taking a leap of faith,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he finally realized this and the science</v>

110
00:06:39.760 --> 00:06:43.580
<v Speaker 1>let go of his fear depicted in a scene</v>
<v Speaker 1>in which he metaphorically embodies the</v>

111
00:06:43.581 --> 00:06:46.670
<v Speaker 1>symbolism of the Jaguar,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which to some stands for the power to</v>

112
00:06:46.671 --> 00:06:49.130
<v Speaker 1>face one's fierce in front one's</v>
<v Speaker 1>enemies.</v>

113
00:06:49.580 --> 00:06:52.340
<v Speaker 1>It's at that point it stops being the</v>
<v Speaker 1>hunted and retakes,</v>

114
00:06:52.370 --> 00:06:55.160
<v Speaker 1>the role of the hunter thank wishing his</v>
<v Speaker 1>adversaries,</v>

115
00:06:55.161 --> 00:07:00.161
<v Speaker 1>one by one</v>
<v Speaker 1>users took a hell of a hit and most</v>

116
00:07:10.661 --> 00:07:13.990
<v Speaker 1>obvious sign of this change in roles of</v>
<v Speaker 1>course has shown fruit to death with</v>

117
00:07:13.991 --> 00:07:16.180
<v Speaker 1>zero wolf by use of the TPO track.</v>

118
00:07:18.520 --> 00:07:19.750
<v Speaker 4>Jennifer</v>

119
00:07:20.340 --> 00:07:23.980
<v Speaker 1>fraud doesn't retake this role for a</v>
<v Speaker 1>long as a chase ends on the beach and</v>

120
00:07:23.981 --> 00:07:28.540
<v Speaker 1>we're back at that controversial climax</v>
<v Speaker 1>and we finally meet the ultimate hunters</v>

121
00:07:28.580 --> 00:07:31.390
<v Speaker 1>or to become the bringers of unspeakable</v>
<v Speaker 1>amounts of death.</v>

122
00:07:31.420 --> 00:07:32.800
<v Speaker 1>Of course,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as you might've noticed,</v>

123
00:07:32.801 --> 00:07:34.930
<v Speaker 1>I don't much agree on a degree of</v>
<v Speaker 1>controversy.</v>

124
00:07:34.940 --> 00:07:38.410
<v Speaker 1>Apply to Apocalypto as a whole,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as I believe that I've shown a story to</v>

125
00:07:38.411 --> 00:07:42.370
<v Speaker 1>me is not at all about justifying or</v>
<v Speaker 1>sweet talking European colonialism in</v>

126
00:07:42.371 --> 00:07:45.130
<v Speaker 1>the Americas,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but rather about more universal themes</v>

127
00:07:45.131 --> 00:07:49.180
<v Speaker 1>and real life cultural tendencies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Mel Gibson as you several aspects of the</v>

128
00:07:49.181 --> 00:07:53.020
<v Speaker 1>Mayan civilization to depict the sort of</v>
<v Speaker 1>a historical summary of its people's</v>

129
00:07:53.021 --> 00:07:55.930
<v Speaker 1>rise and fall,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can even argue that the movie really</v>

130
00:07:55.931 --> 00:07:59.830
<v Speaker 1>isn't all that much about the Mayans at</v>
<v Speaker 1>all as it Gibson himself as stated that</v>

131
00:07:59.831 --> 00:08:03.910
<v Speaker 1>he sees that Buck Lipo is more of an</v>
<v Speaker 1>allegory for modern day America with</v>

132
00:08:03.911 --> 00:08:06.850
<v Speaker 1>many of the same struggles playing a</v>
<v Speaker 1>role in today's society.</v>

133
00:08:07.060 --> 00:08:10.210
<v Speaker 1>I would go as far as stating that</v>
<v Speaker 1>apocalypto stories even more universal</v>

134
00:08:10.211 --> 00:08:13.810
<v Speaker 1>than that and can be seen as a general</v>
<v Speaker 1>visualization of William Durant's</v>

135
00:08:13.811 --> 00:08:15.160
<v Speaker 1>opening.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Quote Duran,</v>

136
00:08:15.161 --> 00:08:16.810
<v Speaker 1>of course,</v>
<v Speaker 1>was speaking of the fall of the Roman</v>

137
00:08:16.811 --> 00:08:19.630
<v Speaker 1>civilization,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but Gibson being Gibson left some direct</v>

138
00:08:19.631 --> 00:08:23.350
<v Speaker 1>references to that sign within the story</v>
<v Speaker 1>of Jaguar as well as another character</v>

139
00:08:23.351 --> 00:08:25.960
<v Speaker 1>or shown seven wounded in the right side</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the abdomen.</v>

140
00:08:26.290 --> 00:08:29.200
<v Speaker 1>This combined with the fact that the</v>
<v Speaker 1>group is being marched off to be</v>

141
00:08:29.201 --> 00:08:32.260
<v Speaker 1>sacrificed and mistakenly brings to</v>
<v Speaker 1>memory one of Gibson's other</v>

142
00:08:32.261 --> 00:08:33.094
<v Speaker 1>protagonists</v>

143
00:08:36.420 --> 00:08:38.310
<v Speaker 1>and right before this is all about to go</v>
<v Speaker 1>down.</v>

144
00:08:38.311 --> 00:08:42.150
<v Speaker 1>Blumkin's mother in law has a brief</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maria moment straight out of the passion</v>

145
00:08:42.151 --> 00:08:43.770
<v Speaker 1>of the Christ.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So in the end,</v>

146
00:08:43.771 --> 00:08:46.020
<v Speaker 1>I believe there's far more substance to</v>
<v Speaker 1>apocalypse,</v>

147
00:08:46.021 --> 00:08:49.530
<v Speaker 1>so dan just a chase scene and a quote</v>
<v Speaker 1>unquote racist message.</v>

148
00:08:49.890 --> 00:08:52.950
<v Speaker 1>It's an action movie of Great</v>
<v Speaker 1>Cinematography and one of the best chase</v>

149
00:08:52.951 --> 00:08:55.680
<v Speaker 1>sequences in Hollywood cinema's history</v>
<v Speaker 1>most,</v>

150
00:08:55.890 --> 00:08:58.530
<v Speaker 1>but in its score,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it remains deeply relevant story about a</v>

151
00:08:58.531 --> 00:09:03.240
<v Speaker 1>universal moral struggle in the cycle of</v>
<v Speaker 1>rise and fall and hunter and hunted,</v>

152
00:09:03.690 --> 00:09:05.180
<v Speaker 1>and although the movie of course the</v>
<v Speaker 1>pics,</v>

153
00:09:05.181 --> 00:09:08.760
<v Speaker 1>the apocalypse or the beginning of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>end for the Mayan civilization,</v>

154
00:09:08.820 --> 00:09:11.130
<v Speaker 1>it also,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and perhaps more importantly,</v>

155
00:09:11.131 --> 00:09:14.340
<v Speaker 1>leaves us with a message of hope to</v>
<v Speaker 1>stick to our morals,</v>

156
00:09:14.370 --> 00:09:18.900
<v Speaker 1>to face the future and to have the</v>
<v Speaker 1>courage to start it all over.</v>

157
00:09:35.700 --> 00:09:38.610
<v Speaker 1>All right guys.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the end of our analysis for</v>

158
00:09:38.611 --> 00:09:41.060
<v Speaker 1>apocalypto.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I hope you enjoyed a.</v>

159
00:09:41.070 --> 00:09:43.800
<v Speaker 1>had a bit of a hard time tackling this</v>
<v Speaker 1>video because there are basically you</v>

160
00:09:43.801 --> 00:09:46.260
<v Speaker 1>were in any articles that agree with my</v>
<v Speaker 1>view of the movie.</v>

161
00:09:46.650 --> 00:09:47.930
<v Speaker 1>Anyways.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What did you think of apocalypse?</v>

162
