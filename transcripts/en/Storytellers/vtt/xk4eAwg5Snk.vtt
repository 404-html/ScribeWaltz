00:00:13.510 --> 00:00:16.060
<v Speaker 1>What is the dream?</v>
<v Speaker 1>The meaningless fantasy.</v>

2
00:00:16.061 --> 00:00:20.770
<v Speaker 1>You have the apps and mine</v>
<v Speaker 1>is it the moments in which everything</v>

3
00:00:20.771 --> 00:00:23.110
<v Speaker 1>about life seems to be in blissful</v>
<v Speaker 1>harmony.</v>

4
00:00:23.440 --> 00:00:26.260
<v Speaker 1>When a struggles of everyday life don't</v>
<v Speaker 1>seem to exist?</v>

5
00:00:26.890 --> 00:00:30.340
<v Speaker 1>What happens when that dream turns out</v>
<v Speaker 1>to suddenly be nothing more than the</v>

6
00:00:30.341 --> 00:00:35.341
<v Speaker 1>line in the lose Ori Reality?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What happens when our life is suddenly</v>

7
00:00:35.591 --> 00:00:40.060
<v Speaker 1>turned upside down into chaos when we're</v>
<v Speaker 1>two days to even realize we're nearing</v>

8
00:00:40.061 --> 00:00:43.570
<v Speaker 1>rock bottom or when it's been two</v>
<v Speaker 1>lifeless to half men much at all.</v>

9
00:00:43.930 --> 00:00:48.160
<v Speaker 1>When he media comes crashing down and</v>
<v Speaker 1>through our reality and to the Light</v>

10
00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:51.690
<v Speaker 1>House that stands at the center of our</v>
<v Speaker 1>unconscious and which we had trust it to</v>

11
00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:56.350
<v Speaker 1>light us a bath in to the unknown and</v>
<v Speaker 1>what happens when we're the ones who are</v>

12
00:00:56.351 --> 00:01:00.460
<v Speaker 1>directly responsible for this collapse,</v>
<v Speaker 1>carrying the burden of guilt.</v>

13
00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:02.620
<v Speaker 1>Ever presence.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You remind us of our deeds.</v>

14
00:01:03.220 --> 00:01:04.990
<v Speaker 1>Perhaps you lick of paint will wash it</v>
<v Speaker 1>away.</v>

15
00:01:05.230 --> 00:01:09.280
<v Speaker 1>Covering the stains of who we truly are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe that way we get to move on.</v>

16
00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:14.060
<v Speaker 1>He's back and miracle that something's</v>
<v Speaker 1>off.</v>

17
00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:16.610
<v Speaker 1>He's changed and he's dying because of</v>
<v Speaker 1>me.</v>

18
00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:19.960
<v Speaker 1>It's my fault.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm a space or whatever he has faced</v>

19
00:01:19.961 --> 00:01:24.110
<v Speaker 1>before me and him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But where and how do we start?</v>

20
00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:36.010
<v Speaker 1>Blackwater National Park reported that a</v>
<v Speaker 1>light house was surrounded by something</v>

21
00:01:36.011 --> 00:01:39.580
<v Speaker 1>they termed a shimmer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is it a religious event,</v>

22
00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:43.240
<v Speaker 1>an extra terrestrial event,</v>
<v Speaker 1>perhaps a higher dimension,</v>

23
00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:47.200
<v Speaker 1>something so large and skill and alien</v>
<v Speaker 1>and appearance has to be something</v>

24
00:01:47.201 --> 00:01:50.770
<v Speaker 1>external outside of us.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And yet at the same time it feels</v>

25
00:01:50.771 --> 00:01:54.010
<v Speaker 1>strangely familiar,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like something profoundly internal,</v>

26
00:01:54.011 --> 00:01:56.560
<v Speaker 1>hidden behind in ever-growing fill of</v>
<v Speaker 1>illusion,</v>

27
00:01:57.100 --> 00:02:00.730
<v Speaker 1>staying on its edge and observing it</v>
<v Speaker 1>from a distance might feel safe,</v>

28
00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:04.570
<v Speaker 1>but the only real solution is to be</v>
<v Speaker 1>found when we mustered the courage to</v>

29
00:02:04.571 --> 00:02:09.571
<v Speaker 1>venture inside and so we shell and the</v>
<v Speaker 1>unconscious one is unfortunately in the</v>

30
00:02:09.731 --> 00:02:11.980
<v Speaker 1>same situation as an a moonlit</v>
<v Speaker 1>landscape.</v>

31
00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:16.360
<v Speaker 1>All the contents are blurred and merge</v>
<v Speaker 1>into one another and one never knows</v>

32
00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:21.390
<v Speaker 1>exactly what or where anything is or</v>
<v Speaker 1>where one thing begins and ends.</v>

33
00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:26.380
<v Speaker 1>This world within the Dome is the</v>
<v Speaker 1>strangest,</v>

34
00:02:26.381 --> 00:02:30.940
<v Speaker 1>most confusing place.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One could visit and don't know where it</v>

35
00:02:30.941 --> 00:02:33.100
<v Speaker 1>was.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Time,</v>

36
00:02:33.101 --> 00:02:36.520
<v Speaker 1>space and matter merge seamlessly as if</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the dream,</v>

37
00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:39.970
<v Speaker 1>the order and structure of the outside</v>
<v Speaker 1>world don't exist here.</v>

38
00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:43.210
<v Speaker 1>To say one might get lost in this place</v>
<v Speaker 1>would be an understatement,</v>

39
00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:47.500
<v Speaker 1>and yet this is the place we</v>
<v Speaker 1>collectively find ourselves did.</v>

40
00:02:47.501 --> 00:02:51.250
<v Speaker 1>Geomorphologists beyond warning the</v>
<v Speaker 1>physicist without purpose,</v>

41
00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:53.710
<v Speaker 1>the addict,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the terminally ill,</v>

42
00:02:53.890 --> 00:02:58.600
<v Speaker 1>the adulterer all in the state of inner</v>
<v Speaker 1>confusion risking their lives to find</v>

43
00:02:58.601 --> 00:02:59.770
<v Speaker 1>answers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>problems,</v>

44
00:02:59.771 --> 00:03:03.330
<v Speaker 1>only dose that are going through deep</v>
<v Speaker 1>inner instability would find himself</v>

45
00:03:03.331 --> 00:03:04.164
<v Speaker 1>Scott up in.</v>

46
00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:07.930
<v Speaker 2>It's not exactly something you do if</v>
<v Speaker 2>your life is in perfect harmony,</v>

47
00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:12.890
<v Speaker 1>but if the king of this world is chaos,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then beauty is not the only thing one is</v>

48
00:03:12.891 --> 00:03:17.090
<v Speaker 1>bound to find lurking just below the</v>
<v Speaker 1>surface are those primal creatures that</v>

49
00:03:17.091 --> 00:03:20.000
<v Speaker 1>will test our instinctual abilities when</v>
<v Speaker 1>we least expect it.</v>

50
00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:23.053
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

51
00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:27.440
<v Speaker 1>The familiar dream in which to dreamers</v>
<v Speaker 1>pursued by an animal nearly always</v>

52
00:03:27.441 --> 00:03:30.740
<v Speaker 1>indicates that an instinct has been</v>
<v Speaker 1>split off from our consciousness and</v>

53
00:03:30.741 --> 00:03:34.640
<v Speaker 1>ought to be yours trying to be</v>
<v Speaker 1>readmitted and integrated into life.</v>

54
00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:37.640
<v Speaker 1>The more dangerous to behavior of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>animal and the dream.</v>

55
00:03:37.820 --> 00:03:40.570
<v Speaker 1>The more unconscious is the primitive</v>
<v Speaker 1>and instinctual soul.</v>

56
00:03:40.590 --> 00:03:44.330
<v Speaker 1>The dreamer and the more imperative is</v>
<v Speaker 1>its integration into his life.</v>

57
00:03:44.331 --> 00:03:49.260
<v Speaker 1>If some irreparable evil is to be</v>
<v Speaker 1>forestalled facing this dragon head on</v>

58
00:03:49.270 --> 00:03:52.430
<v Speaker 1>is to merge with the primal instincts</v>
<v Speaker 1>that can guide us deeper into this new</v>

59
00:03:52.431 --> 00:03:55.010
<v Speaker 1>world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Failing to do so can make us stray from</v>

60
00:03:55.011 --> 00:03:57.200
<v Speaker 1>the light and become blinded in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>darkness,</v>

61
00:03:57.500 --> 00:04:00.440
<v Speaker 1>unconscious in Darfur,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a vulnerable to the dangerous that can</v>

62
00:04:00.441 --> 00:04:02.210
<v Speaker 1>emerge into our lives.</v>
<v Speaker 1>At any moment.</v>

63
00:04:07.210 --> 00:04:09.640
<v Speaker 1>We've come upon an abandoned military</v>
<v Speaker 1>base,</v>

64
00:04:09.790 --> 00:04:13.750
<v Speaker 1>a safe haven for those that came before</v>
<v Speaker 1>the memory card is found.</v>

65
00:04:14.180 --> 00:04:18.160
<v Speaker 1>His second revelation reveals itself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The monsters we believe to be</v>

66
00:04:18.161 --> 00:04:22.690
<v Speaker 1>exclusively external nature dwell</v>
<v Speaker 1>abundantly within our own bodies,</v>

67
00:04:23.020 --> 00:04:26.710
<v Speaker 1>within our souls.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It realization emerges,</v>

68
00:04:26.980 --> 00:04:31.000
<v Speaker 1>am I to veal danger?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Am I nothing bent on self destruction,</v>

69
00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:32.850
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Drink well,</v>

70
00:04:33.050 --> 00:04:38.050
<v Speaker 2>we smell and taste stabilize the good</v>
<v Speaker 2>job having marriage</v>

71
00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:41.080
<v Speaker 1>setting,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it will be to admit to one's own</v>

72
00:04:41.081 --> 00:04:43.600
<v Speaker 1>shortcomings,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which we so often tried to hide behind a</v>

73
00:04:43.601 --> 00:04:46.870
<v Speaker 1>mass personality,</v>
<v Speaker 1>denying it would be to disown its</v>

74
00:04:46.871 --> 00:04:50.350
<v Speaker 1>existence within oneself completely.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There was something alive inside that</v>

75
00:04:50.351 --> 00:04:50.980
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

76
00:04:50.980 --> 00:04:54.340
<v Speaker 1>that was a trick of the light.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When an individual makes an attempt to</v>

77
00:04:54.341 --> 00:04:57.400
<v Speaker 1>see your shadow,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he becomes aware of and often ashamed of</v>

78
00:04:57.401 --> 00:05:00.040
<v Speaker 1>those qualities and impulses he denies</v>
<v Speaker 1>in himself,</v>

79
00:05:00.041 --> 00:05:03.130
<v Speaker 1>but completely see you and other people</v>
<v Speaker 1>such things as egotism,</v>

80
00:05:03.131 --> 00:05:07.210
<v Speaker 1>mental laziness and sloppiness,</v>
<v Speaker 1>unreal fantasy's schemes and plots,</v>

81
00:05:07.240 --> 00:05:11.350
<v Speaker 1>carelessness and cowardice insured all</v>
<v Speaker 1>the little sins about which he might</v>

82
00:05:11.351 --> 00:05:13.840
<v Speaker 1>previously have told himself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That doesn't matter.</v>

83
00:05:13.900 --> 00:05:15.850
<v Speaker 1>Nobody will notice it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and in any case,</v>

84
00:05:15.880 --> 00:05:20.050
<v Speaker 1>although people do it too for to deny or</v>
<v Speaker 1>the only way out is to project one's own</v>

85
00:05:20.051 --> 00:05:24.070
<v Speaker 1>monsters on two dose around her.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How could I ever be a monster?</v>

86
00:05:24.100 --> 00:05:26.290
<v Speaker 1>Maybe you or you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but not me.</v>

87
00:05:26.650 --> 00:05:30.100
<v Speaker 1>For it is I who knows the way and who</v>
<v Speaker 1>will save the world from then nation?</v>

88
00:05:30.820 --> 00:05:33.940
<v Speaker 1>It's unconscious failure or to come to</v>
<v Speaker 1>terms with one's own reality then</v>

89
00:05:33.941 --> 00:05:36.580
<v Speaker 1>becomes nothing more than another</v>
<v Speaker 1>ultimate dead end.</v>

90
00:05:37.120 --> 00:05:40.090
<v Speaker 1>It is only doe sit on some level.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've made peace with the fact that</v>

91
00:05:40.091 --> 00:05:44.050
<v Speaker 1>spending time in this world is slowly</v>
<v Speaker 1>changing who we are and how we perceive</v>

92
00:05:44.051 --> 00:05:46.840
<v Speaker 1>ourselves.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's this growing realization that the</v>

93
00:05:46.841 --> 00:05:50.380
<v Speaker 1>tumor of the Shimmer isn't necessarily</v>
<v Speaker 1>caused by something outside of</v>

94
00:05:50.381 --> 00:05:53.230
<v Speaker 1>ourselves,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but perhaps an echo from our own in our</v>

95
00:05:53.231 --> 00:05:56.800
<v Speaker 1>world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so the only way to save the world</v>

96
00:05:56.801 --> 00:06:00.650
<v Speaker 1>would to save oneself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But why would one bot or to go through</v>

97
00:06:00.651 --> 00:06:04.280
<v Speaker 1>such lengths to salvage something that</v>
<v Speaker 1>wasn't even perceive to contain much</v>

98
00:06:04.281 --> 00:06:07.280
<v Speaker 1>value to begin with?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Life does what it wants,</v>

99
00:06:07.640 --> 00:06:11.240
<v Speaker 1>why bought are struggling against its</v>
<v Speaker 1>will and trust wants to face it.</v>

100
00:06:12.380 --> 00:06:13.430
<v Speaker 1>You want to fight it?</v>

101
00:06:15.500 --> 00:06:17.870
<v Speaker 1>I don't think I want to either of those</v>
<v Speaker 1>things.</v>

102
00:06:18.680 --> 00:06:22.580
<v Speaker 1>Only those who truly desire to return</v>
<v Speaker 1>will have the power to we merge.</v>

103
00:06:23.360 --> 00:06:27.200
<v Speaker 1>And so one by one the companions bearish</v>
<v Speaker 1>dissolve and disappear.</v>

104
00:06:27.620 --> 00:06:31.100
<v Speaker 1>And so Lena is the only one left.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why did they have to succumb to the</v>

105
00:06:31.101 --> 00:06:35.390
<v Speaker 1>darkness and why am I still here where</v>
<v Speaker 1>they really Anya Shepherd,</v>

106
00:06:35.510 --> 00:06:40.340
<v Speaker 1>Josie venturous or do you just</v>
<v Speaker 1>characters every dream fragmented parts</v>

107
00:06:40.341 --> 00:06:44.330
<v Speaker 1>of an unconscious personality seeking to</v>
<v Speaker 1>be integrated onto the body like the</v>

108
00:06:44.331 --> 00:06:46.730
<v Speaker 1>ever continuing cycle of death and</v>
<v Speaker 1>rebirth.</v>

109
00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:51.260
<v Speaker 1>The sign of the oral burrows to dramatic</v>
<v Speaker 1>symbol of the snake eating its own till</v>

110
00:06:51.261 --> 00:06:54.650
<v Speaker 1>40 integration and assimilation of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>opposite of the shadow.</v>

111
00:06:55.310 --> 00:06:59.150
<v Speaker 1>The only way to truly find out what all</v>
<v Speaker 1>of this means is to make one final push</v>

112
00:06:59.151 --> 00:07:01.700
<v Speaker 1>towards the center,</v>
<v Speaker 1>towards the light house.</v>

113
00:07:05.690 --> 00:07:09.080
<v Speaker 1>In this final leg of the journey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we are already well broken down,</v>

114
00:07:09.590 --> 00:07:13.280
<v Speaker 1>but as we enter into the lighthouse,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we slowly began to realize the toughest</v>

115
00:07:13.281 --> 00:07:16.580
<v Speaker 1>challenge is still in front of us,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hidden in the darkness,</v>

116
00:07:16.610 --> 00:07:20.410
<v Speaker 1>deep beneath the shining light at a</v>
<v Speaker 1>tower in Mandela shaped or puberes</v>

117
00:07:20.840 --> 00:07:23.840
<v Speaker 1>magnificent in its wholeness,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but equally frightening and appearance.</v>

118
00:07:23.841 --> 00:07:27.620
<v Speaker 1>It shows us a mirror out of which a</v>
<v Speaker 1>figure emerges in shock.</v>

119
00:07:27.621 --> 00:07:30.920
<v Speaker 1>We stumble and we run,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or perhaps we don't run at all,</v>

120
00:07:30.921 --> 00:07:33.140
<v Speaker 1>but lose ourselves in complete</v>
<v Speaker 1>confusion.</v>

121
00:07:33.550 --> 00:07:34.700
<v Speaker 1>People call him the cane.</v>

122
00:07:36.910 --> 00:07:37.660
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

123
00:07:37.660 --> 00:07:40.780
<v Speaker 1>Now I'm not so sure I can try to fight</v>
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

124
00:07:40.900 --> 00:07:45.070
<v Speaker 1>but it mirrors my every move,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so perhaps I should desire it for self</v>

125
00:07:45.071 --> 00:07:47.170
<v Speaker 1>destruction is ultimately all that</v>
<v Speaker 1>certain.</v>

126
00:07:47.770 --> 00:07:50.230
<v Speaker 1>What is this creature at acts as if my</v>
<v Speaker 1>shadow,</v>

127
00:07:50.770 --> 00:07:55.030
<v Speaker 1>suddenly a face begins to take form you</v>
<v Speaker 1>sudden realization dawns on us.</v>

128
00:07:57.040 --> 00:07:57.873
<v Speaker 2>You May.</v>

129
00:07:58.250 --> 00:08:01.610
<v Speaker 1>If you are mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you are more meat and I am than I am</v>

130
00:08:01.611 --> 00:08:03.920
<v Speaker 1>alive and I can exist no longer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

131
00:08:03.921 --> 00:08:08.900
<v Speaker 1>At Baron we finally become fully aware</v>
<v Speaker 1>that this world is not at all alien in</v>

132
00:08:08.901 --> 00:08:11.300
<v Speaker 1>nature,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but a part of her own self that was</v>

133
00:08:11.301 --> 00:08:15.200
<v Speaker 1>hidden away in our unconscious,</v>
<v Speaker 1>desperately trying to be acknowledged.</v>

134
00:08:15.830 --> 00:08:16.830
<v Speaker 1>The only way forward for</v>

135
00:08:16.840 --> 00:08:21.070
<v Speaker 3>Dennis to look oneself directly in the</v>
<v Speaker 3>eye and accepting to shadow as it is</v>

136
00:08:21.520 --> 00:08:26.520
<v Speaker 3>only then can final illuminating</v>
<v Speaker 3>integration be achieved and miss the</v>

137
00:08:26.621 --> 00:08:30.160
<v Speaker 3>hero is the one who conquers the dragon,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not the one who was devoured by it.</v>

138
00:08:30.610 --> 00:08:33.340
<v Speaker 3>Only one who has risks.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The fight with the dragon and it's not</v>

139
00:08:33.341 --> 00:08:36.550
<v Speaker 3>overcome by winds.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The horde the treasurer hard to attain.</v>

140
00:08:37.150 --> 00:08:41.290
<v Speaker 3>He alone has a genuine claim to self</v>
<v Speaker 3>confidence for he has faced a dark</v>

141
00:08:41.291 --> 00:08:43.840
<v Speaker 3>rounds of the self and dare buying has</v>
<v Speaker 3>gained himself.</v>

142
00:08:44.500 --> 00:08:46.390
<v Speaker 3>We now know better.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We truly are.</v>

143
00:08:46.391 --> 00:08:51.190
<v Speaker 3>And if Daryl by dissolved or pathologies</v>
<v Speaker 3>do return to orders there for shown as a</v>

144
00:08:51.191 --> 00:08:54.280
<v Speaker 3>reconciliation of true previously a</v>
<v Speaker 3>strange soles,</v>

145
00:08:54.870 --> 00:08:58.770
<v Speaker 3>both fought and died in one way or</v>
<v Speaker 3>another and both have reemerged as</v>

146
00:08:58.771 --> 00:09:02.340
<v Speaker 3>someone else won a mere shadow of his</v>
<v Speaker 3>former self.</v>

147
00:09:02.370 --> 00:09:06.570
<v Speaker 3>The other more intact strangers but</v>
<v Speaker 3>strangers more attuned to each other</v>

148
00:09:06.571 --> 00:09:08.970
<v Speaker 3>than ever before.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Embracing one another.</v>

149
00:09:08.971 --> 00:09:11.160
<v Speaker 3>So the very first step to start a new.</v>
