1
00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:08.540
<v Speaker 1>This is many of you will undoubtedly</v>
<v Speaker 1>remember.</v>

2
00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:12.230
<v Speaker 1>It's the opening shot of Disney's beauty</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the beast.</v>

3
00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:15.740
<v Speaker 1>At first glance,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's colorful ballot and introduction of</v>

4
00:00:15.741 --> 00:00:19.460
<v Speaker 1>main characters and plot points don't</v>
<v Speaker 1>seem to deviate too much from your</v>

5
00:00:19.461 --> 00:00:22.880
<v Speaker 1>typical Disney movie.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We have her princess or young adult girl</v>

6
00:00:22.881 --> 00:00:27.881
<v Speaker 1>who seeks some sort of fulfillment or</v>
<v Speaker 1>help element of magic evil forces</v>

7
00:00:28.221 --> 00:00:32.810
<v Speaker 1>working against the princess or prince</v>
<v Speaker 1>coming to the rescue and of course the</v>

8
00:00:32.811 --> 00:00:35.030
<v Speaker 1>ensuing love story.</v>
<v Speaker 1>However,</v>

9
00:00:35.031 --> 00:00:39.380
<v Speaker 1>despite first surface level impressions,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is not at all what beauty in the</v>

10
00:00:39.381 --> 00:00:43.660
<v Speaker 1>beast is about as it goes down a wholly</v>
<v Speaker 1>different and darker path all together,</v>

11
00:00:44.170 --> 00:00:47.780
<v Speaker 1>thereby namely following the principles</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the Gothic John.</v>

12
00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:52.070
<v Speaker 1>Now it's important that we outlined the</v>
<v Speaker 1>difference between the male and the</v>

13
00:00:52.071 --> 00:00:55.220
<v Speaker 1>female gothic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The mill variant laid the foundations</v>

14
00:00:55.221 --> 00:00:57.170
<v Speaker 1>for today's horror stories.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wiles,</v>

15
00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:01.040
<v Speaker 1>the female version became the basis for</v>
<v Speaker 1>today's historical romance stories,</v>

16
00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:03.830
<v Speaker 1>if you will.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Version route generally feature a dark</v>

17
00:01:03.831 --> 00:01:07.430
<v Speaker 1>ass or a mansion style with looming</v>
<v Speaker 1>arches in towers,</v>

18
00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:11.900
<v Speaker 1>a young woman thesis of a dark secret to</v>
<v Speaker 1>uncover who runs away at some point</v>

19
00:01:11.901 --> 00:01:16.160
<v Speaker 1>before she discovers her own power.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A flawed romantic lead who must be</v>

20
00:01:16.161 --> 00:01:20.540
<v Speaker 1>taught how to love a rival or</v>
<v Speaker 1>alternative lead who turns out to be</v>

21
00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:23.630
<v Speaker 1>evil.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And finally a happy ending through a</v>

22
00:01:23.631 --> 00:01:25.160
<v Speaker 1>process of redemption.</v>

23
00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:34.470
<v Speaker 1>Interestingly to sub genre has long been</v>
<v Speaker 1>characterized by kind of schizophrenia</v>

24
00:01:34.830 --> 00:01:38.400
<v Speaker 1>representing the female leads,</v>
<v Speaker 1>inner struggle with personality or</v>

25
00:01:38.410 --> 00:01:42.990
<v Speaker 1>conscious and unconscious fight between</v>
<v Speaker 1>conforming jurors society and breaking</v>

26
00:01:42.991 --> 00:01:45.450
<v Speaker 1>away from it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's not hard to see that this is</v>

27
00:01:45.451 --> 00:01:49.920
<v Speaker 1>exactly a thing that bell attempting to</v>
<v Speaker 1>deal with in her own small town world.</v>

28
00:01:50.190 --> 00:01:54.630
<v Speaker 1>It's a theme that moves her forward and</v>
<v Speaker 1>drives her decision making and really</v>

29
00:01:54.631 --> 00:01:57.780
<v Speaker 1>encompasses the story of beauty and the</v>
<v Speaker 1>beast in its entirety.</v>

30
00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:00.420
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would argue that the film in itself is</v>

31
00:02:00.421 --> 00:02:05.421
<v Speaker 1>not so much about finding law in each</v>
<v Speaker 1>other as it is about finding love and</v>

32
00:02:05.641 --> 00:02:06.990
<v Speaker 1>peace in one itself.</v>

33
00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:17.750
<v Speaker 1>Well of course in order for peace to</v>
<v Speaker 1>exist,</v>

34
00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:22.780
<v Speaker 1>there also has to be war.</v>
<v Speaker 1>As the plot is breaking into its fruit,</v>

35
00:02:23.661 --> 00:02:26.270
<v Speaker 1>I climax,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we are exposed to the peak of beauty and</v>

36
00:02:26.271 --> 00:02:29.750
<v Speaker 1>the beast drama,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the final showdown between guest on his</v>

37
00:02:29.751 --> 00:02:34.580
<v Speaker 1>angry mob and the misunderstood beast.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But as exciting and funny as it may be,</v>

38
00:02:34.581 --> 00:02:37.230
<v Speaker 1>to watch the innovating villagers get</v>
<v Speaker 1>ambushed by it,</v>

39
00:02:37.231 --> 00:02:40.040
<v Speaker 1>to be stool servants.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Looking at it from an outside</v>

40
00:02:40.041 --> 00:02:43.190
<v Speaker 1>perspective also makes it undeniably</v>
<v Speaker 1>silly.</v>

41
00:02:43.630 --> 00:02:46.040
<v Speaker 1>I don't get me wrong,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're probably thinking,</v>

42
00:02:46.041 --> 00:02:46.821
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Thomas,</v>

43
00:02:46.821 --> 00:02:48.830
<v Speaker 1>why wouldn't it be?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a fairy tale,</v>

44
00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:51.020
<v Speaker 1>and that's exactly right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's fantasy.</v>

45
00:02:51.021 --> 00:02:53.120
<v Speaker 1>It's a made up story,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's utilized.</v>

46
00:02:53.121 --> 00:02:57.980
<v Speaker 1>You convey a very real message.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One that as is not uncommon for Gothic</v>

47
00:02:57.981 --> 00:03:01.600
<v Speaker 1>novels,</v>
<v Speaker 1>exists on the interior rather than the</v>

48
00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:06.220
<v Speaker 1>exterior because the actual focus of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>story is not really the physical</v>

49
00:03:06.221 --> 00:03:09.040
<v Speaker 1>struggle of Belle and the beast to be</v>
<v Speaker 1>accepted into our world,</v>

50
00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:13.210
<v Speaker 1>but rather the emotional and unconscious</v>
<v Speaker 1>struggle between the animal and human</v>

51
00:03:13.211 --> 00:03:17.440
<v Speaker 1>natures within the protagonists scene</v>
<v Speaker 1>first and the Greek myth of arrows and</v>

52
00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:19.900
<v Speaker 1>CCA,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this archetypal story deals with the</v>

53
00:03:19.901 --> 00:03:24.400
<v Speaker 1>reality of the bodied Ron Nature and</v>
<v Speaker 1>sexual side of humans on the one hand</v>

54
00:03:24.670 --> 00:03:28.540
<v Speaker 1>and the more spiritual,</v>
<v Speaker 1>rational soul on the other centuries</v>

55
00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:29.500
<v Speaker 1>later fairytales,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the big,</v>

56
00:03:29.501 --> 00:03:33.430
<v Speaker 1>the same duality and animal groom tills</v>
<v Speaker 1>in which the animal makes the life of</v>

57
00:03:33.431 --> 00:03:38.080
<v Speaker 1>the female protagonists unpleasant but</v>
<v Speaker 1>ultimately turn out to be gentlemen or</v>

58
00:03:38.081 --> 00:03:39.460
<v Speaker 1>princess in disguise.</v>

59
00:03:39.790 --> 00:03:43.840
<v Speaker 1>This recurring characterised also been</v>
<v Speaker 1>described as the image of the wild man</v>

60
00:03:44.230 --> 00:03:48.430
<v Speaker 1>who's part of an archetypal dialectic</v>
<v Speaker 1>that places wildness along with such</v>

61
00:03:48.431 --> 00:03:53.320
<v Speaker 1>things as Savitri madness,</v>
<v Speaker 1>heresy and hatred and conceptual</v>

62
00:03:53.321 --> 00:03:58.321
<v Speaker 1>antithesis to all things civilization.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now as we look back at the story of</v>

63
00:03:58.991 --> 00:04:01.840
<v Speaker 1>beauty and the beast is dwell,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the becomes highly apparent.</v>

64
00:04:02.290 --> 00:04:04.060
<v Speaker 1>Being to wild men character and his</v>
<v Speaker 1>story.</v>

65
00:04:04.061 --> 00:04:06.850
<v Speaker 1>Beast identifies of a number of animal</v>
<v Speaker 1>motifs.</v>

66
00:04:07.210 --> 00:04:10.660
<v Speaker 1>The first and most obvious one being his</v>
<v Speaker 1>ugliness and physical appearance,</v>

67
00:04:10.690 --> 00:04:13.420
<v Speaker 1>but more importantly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's the realization that is hideous.</v>

68
00:04:13.421 --> 00:04:16.660
<v Speaker 1>Appearance is linked directly to his</v>
<v Speaker 1>ugly personality.</v>

69
00:04:16.820 --> 00:04:18.010
<v Speaker 1>Why isn't she here?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yet?</v>

70
00:04:18.370 --> 00:04:21.160
<v Speaker 1>We know from the voiceover in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>beginning of the movie that he was</v>

71
00:04:21.161 --> 00:04:24.400
<v Speaker 1>spoiled,</v>
<v Speaker 1>selfish and unkind liking law.</v>

72
00:04:24.401 --> 00:04:27.280
<v Speaker 1>Then his heart,</v>
<v Speaker 1>his inner world is mirror directly to</v>

73
00:04:27.281 --> 00:04:30.150
<v Speaker 1>his surroundings as a showcase by the</v>
<v Speaker 1>constant dark and venue.</v>

74
00:04:30.160 --> 00:04:34.720
<v Speaker 1>Rhetor has ravaged hidden west wing and</v>
<v Speaker 1>the existence of this tool servants</v>

75
00:04:35.140 --> 00:04:39.520
<v Speaker 1>because he who treats his fellow human</v>
<v Speaker 1>beings as tools will ultimately only see</v>

76
00:04:39.521 --> 00:04:42.760
<v Speaker 1>them as such and nothing more as a side</v>
<v Speaker 1>effect of his appearance.</v>

77
00:04:42.761 --> 00:04:45.880
<v Speaker 1>Bese also identifies with the Motif of</v>
<v Speaker 1>captivity.</v>

78
00:04:46.070 --> 00:04:48.280
<v Speaker 1>Not only does he wrongfully imprisoned</v>
<v Speaker 1>marise,</v>

79
00:04:48.281 --> 00:04:51.910
<v Speaker 1>he initially also doesn't feel remorse</v>
<v Speaker 1>for doing the same to bell.</v>

80
00:04:52.030 --> 00:04:56.560
<v Speaker 1>The for a prisoner in his castle then is</v>
<v Speaker 1>himself having drifted into apathy and</v>

81
00:04:56.561 --> 00:04:59.290
<v Speaker 1>rage over his.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Apparently he cursed fate with this</v>

82
00:04:59.291 --> 00:05:03.700
<v Speaker 1>lowly mental state comes his last Motif</v>
<v Speaker 1>nonthinking which just metaphorically</v>

83
00:05:03.701 --> 00:05:05.610
<v Speaker 1>shown here in is repressed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The ability to</v>

84
00:05:05.720 --> 00:05:10.720
<v Speaker 2>read that I can't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just Ben Guest Oss</v>

85
00:05:15.470 --> 00:05:18.090
<v Speaker 1>is second carrier of the Animal Motif.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Of course,</v>

86
00:05:18.091 --> 00:05:22.170
<v Speaker 1>he starts off as what seems to be the</v>
<v Speaker 1>epitome of perfected humanity with his</v>

87
00:05:22.171 --> 00:05:24.720
<v Speaker 1>handsome looks,</v>
<v Speaker 1>strong physical appearance and</v>

88
00:05:24.721 --> 00:05:28.770
<v Speaker 1>attachment to the freedom motif.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No one says no to guests in reality.</v>

89
00:05:28.771 --> 00:05:32.760
<v Speaker 1>However,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is only but a facade as he's</v>

90
00:05:32.820 --> 00:05:36.690
<v Speaker 1>covered with hair foreshadows the beast</v>
<v Speaker 1>thickness within his physical beauty.</v>

91
00:05:37.080 --> 00:05:42.080
<v Speaker 1>Gustavo sends a freedom is also strongly</v>
<v Speaker 1>egoic and vindictive as it depends on</v>

92
00:05:42.361 --> 00:05:47.100
<v Speaker 1>its ability to control both animal as</v>
<v Speaker 1>well as human whatever the cost may be</v>

93
00:05:48.870 --> 00:05:52.610
<v Speaker 1>fun.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My wife make no mistake about that.</v>

94
00:05:52.980 --> 00:05:57.600
<v Speaker 1>It's no surprise that his character</v>
<v Speaker 1>mirroring beasts also identifies of non</v>

95
00:05:57.601 --> 00:06:00.440
<v Speaker 1>thinking and even sees it as something</v>
<v Speaker 1>malevolent.</v>

96
00:06:00.920 --> 00:06:02.060
<v Speaker 1>Ooh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm afraid.</v>

97
00:06:02.061 --> 00:06:07.061
<v Speaker 1>I've been thinking dangerous pastime.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know bell on the other hand is the one</v>

98
00:06:08.091 --> 00:06:10.940
<v Speaker 1>major carrier of the human motif like a</v>
<v Speaker 1>star.</v>

99
00:06:10.941 --> 00:06:15.110
<v Speaker 1>She identifies a beauty which is really</v>
<v Speaker 1>the only thing the villagers compliment</v>

100
00:06:15.111 --> 00:06:15.944
<v Speaker 1>her for.</v>

101
00:06:15.980 --> 00:06:16.813
<v Speaker 2>There she goes,</v>

102
00:06:21.180 --> 00:06:24.870
<v Speaker 1>or oddity marks the second and third.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Once he has it showcases her sense of</v>

103
00:06:24.871 --> 00:06:26.910
<v Speaker 1>individualism and strive for freedom</v>

104
00:06:32.020 --> 00:06:35.170
<v Speaker 1>because although at the moment she's</v>
<v Speaker 1>torn between fitting in and leaving her</v>

105
00:06:35.171 --> 00:06:38.830
<v Speaker 1>provincial life behind.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She finds solace in reading a lot.</v>

106
00:06:39.030 --> 00:06:42.040
<v Speaker 1>This one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you've read it twice.</v>

107
00:06:42.630 --> 00:06:46.800
<v Speaker 1>Film evidently makes no secret about it</v>
<v Speaker 1>that val identify at the thinking with</v>

108
00:06:46.801 --> 00:06:49.600
<v Speaker 1>Eve,</v>
<v Speaker 1>read it and unthinking so much so it at</v>

109
00:06:49.601 --> 00:06:53.740
<v Speaker 1>her entire inner beauty and humanities</v>
<v Speaker 1>seems to originate from the archetypal</v>

110
00:06:53.741 --> 00:06:56.020
<v Speaker 1>stories she has read.</v>
<v Speaker 1>These books have taught her to</v>

111
00:06:56.021 --> 00:07:00.130
<v Speaker 1>archetypes for fighting injustice</v>
<v Speaker 1>against overwhelming odds for seeing</v>

112
00:07:00.131 --> 00:07:04.420
<v Speaker 1>beyond the surface for courage and</v>
<v Speaker 1>strength and once oddities and for</v>

113
00:07:04.421 --> 00:07:07.660
<v Speaker 1>wisdom and decision making and breaking</v>
<v Speaker 1>away from group think.</v>

114
00:07:07.840 --> 00:07:10.300
<v Speaker 1>According to Carl Young,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the absolute strength of these</v>

115
00:07:10.301 --> 00:07:14.080
<v Speaker 1>archetypal stories lies in our function</v>
<v Speaker 1>as pointers to to quote unquote</v>

116
00:07:14.081 --> 00:07:17.860
<v Speaker 1>collective unconscious,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that part of self that mediates between</v>

117
00:07:17.861 --> 00:07:22.450
<v Speaker 1>our consciousness and unconsciousness,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the human and the animalistic with the</v>

118
00:07:22.451 --> 00:07:26.890
<v Speaker 1>goal to guide us towards maturity,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to bridge that internal divide.</v>

119
00:07:26.950 --> 00:07:30.130
<v Speaker 1>We see it in bell.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She's slowly developing and trying to</v>

120
00:07:30.131 --> 00:07:33.550
<v Speaker 1>figure out her own individuality,</v>
<v Speaker 1>her own uniqueness,</v>

121
00:07:33.760 --> 00:07:38.680
<v Speaker 1>but paradoxically does natural process</v>
<v Speaker 1>of individuation is also at the core of</v>

122
00:07:38.681 --> 00:07:41.950
<v Speaker 1>the growing loss of the ability to live</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the present moment,</v>

123
00:07:42.190 --> 00:07:45.130
<v Speaker 1>a loss of sense of oneness in community</v>
<v Speaker 1>and to you.</v>

124
00:07:45.131 --> 00:07:48.940
<v Speaker 1>Borek force of nature as a whole now</v>
<v Speaker 1>have that knowledge in mind,</v>

125
00:07:48.941 --> 00:07:52.030
<v Speaker 1>a new door in to the uniqueness of</v>
<v Speaker 1>beauty and the beast has suddenly</v>

126
00:07:52.031 --> 00:07:54.790
<v Speaker 1>opened,</v>
<v Speaker 1>revealing to us the films function as an</v>

127
00:07:54.791 --> 00:07:59.110
<v Speaker 1>archetypal Meta narrative of sorts.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We can now see how at first be strikes a</v>

128
00:07:59.111 --> 00:08:02.030
<v Speaker 1>deal with his dwell.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He buys scapegoating and and her</v>

129
00:08:02.480 --> 00:08:05.900
<v Speaker 2>awesome eat with me doesn't eat.</v>

130
00:08:07.420 --> 00:08:10.870
<v Speaker 1>We can also see how this method of</v>
<v Speaker 1>victimization has worked for guest on</v>

131
00:08:10.890 --> 00:08:15.460
<v Speaker 1>who was fully identified and content</v>
<v Speaker 1>with his ego until bell comes along,</v>

132
00:08:15.461 --> 00:08:19.240
<v Speaker 1>breaking the fragility of this illusion</v>
<v Speaker 1>and causing guest dawn's humanity to</v>

133
00:08:19.241 --> 00:08:22.600
<v Speaker 1>crumble completely as he slowly descends</v>
<v Speaker 1>into his brutish,</v>

134
00:08:22.601 --> 00:08:25.990
<v Speaker 1>animalistic nature until it ultimately</v>
<v Speaker 1>he destroys him</v>

135
00:08:28.510 --> 00:08:31.210
<v Speaker 1>glee for beasts.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The reverse happens when bell shines a</v>

136
00:08:31.211 --> 00:08:35.050
<v Speaker 1>light on his darker side and invites him</v>
<v Speaker 1>to come to terms with it through axle.</v>

137
00:08:35.051 --> 00:08:36.790
<v Speaker 1>Selflessness and honesty.</v>

138
00:08:43.010 --> 00:08:44.730
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>please.</v>

139
00:08:44.870 --> 00:08:48.470
<v Speaker 1>What happens next is the beginning of</v>
<v Speaker 1>both their transformations as beast</v>

140
00:08:48.471 --> 00:08:52.670
<v Speaker 1>rescues bell from the pack of wolves and</v>
<v Speaker 1>she in turn shoot his honor and</v>

141
00:08:52.671 --> 00:08:55.190
<v Speaker 1>compassion by saving beasts these</v>
<v Speaker 1>actions,</v>

142
00:08:55.370 --> 00:09:00.250
<v Speaker 1>bees to move away from as victimization</v>
<v Speaker 1>and to take self responsibility for the</v>

143
00:09:00.251 --> 00:09:02.940
<v Speaker 1>very first time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which doesn't go unnoticed.</v>

144
00:09:03.620 --> 00:09:04.453
<v Speaker 2>Now he's</v>

145
00:09:07.890 --> 00:09:12.410
<v Speaker 1>why I didn't see it there before.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And out of bell two is conscious of our</v>

146
00:09:12.411 --> 00:09:15.180
<v Speaker 1>own ignorance.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The seed for their ultimate unification</v>

147
00:09:15.181 --> 00:09:18.030
<v Speaker 1>has been blended.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What follows is a process of growth and</v>

148
00:09:18.031 --> 00:09:21.410
<v Speaker 1>interplay of dwell at ease,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which ends with a dance in which animal</v>

149
00:09:21.411 --> 00:09:24.330
<v Speaker 1>and human are joined together and attack</v>
<v Speaker 1>line of the song.</v>

150
00:09:24.840 --> 00:09:29.840
<v Speaker 2>Let me go skate.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Beauty.</v>

151
00:09:30.450 --> 00:09:32.070
<v Speaker 2>And the beast</v>

152
00:09:32.500 --> 00:09:35.630
<v Speaker 1>is at this point that beast is ready to</v>
<v Speaker 1>make the final step in his</v>

153
00:09:35.631 --> 00:09:39.650
<v Speaker 1>transformation by show of true love,</v>
<v Speaker 1>through a dramatic act of self</v>

154
00:09:39.651 --> 00:09:42.890
<v Speaker 1>sacrifice.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And after having spent some time alone,</v>

155
00:09:42.891 --> 00:09:47.000
<v Speaker 1>bell realizes the same thing as she</v>
<v Speaker 1>kneels down beside the dying beast.</v>

156
00:09:49.670 --> 00:09:53.420
<v Speaker 1>So to spell is finally broken as both</v>
<v Speaker 1>transformations have now been completed.</v>

157
00:09:53.600 --> 00:09:57.530
<v Speaker 1>And so Belle and the beast,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the human and the animal are finally</v>

158
00:09:57.531 --> 00:10:00.650
<v Speaker 1>reunited and reintegrated in coexisting</v>
<v Speaker 1>harmony.</v>

159
00:10:00.830 --> 00:10:04.820
<v Speaker 1>It's an archetypal story that has become</v>
<v Speaker 1>more relevant in today's world than it's</v>

160
00:10:04.821 --> 00:10:08.240
<v Speaker 1>probably ever been.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The upcoming and true search of social</v>

161
00:10:08.241 --> 00:10:12.380
<v Speaker 1>media and in particular dating apps,</v>
<v Speaker 1>f arguably bloated our egos and have</v>

162
00:10:12.381 --> 00:10:16.430
<v Speaker 1>degraded the concept of love and to Amir</v>
<v Speaker 1>and mindless movement off the finger.</v>

163
00:10:16.700 --> 00:10:20.360
<v Speaker 1>We suppress and ignore our anxieties and</v>
<v Speaker 1>our feelings of separateness by</v>

164
00:10:20.361 --> 00:10:24.170
<v Speaker 1>connecting evermore.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yet a lot of us can't help but feel</v>

165
00:10:24.260 --> 00:10:28.940
<v Speaker 1>meaningless alone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It really is a continuous struggle until</v>

166
00:10:28.941 --> 00:10:33.941
<v Speaker 1>we choose to stop seeing it as such and</v>
<v Speaker 1>instead face it head on and make it into</v>

167
00:10:33.971 --> 00:10:34.804
<v Speaker 1>a dance.</v>

168
00:10:35.060 --> 00:10:37.580
<v Speaker 3>Hello,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Lee.</v>

169
00:10:38.290 --> 00:10:39.230
<v Speaker 1>Hi,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Miss.</v>

170
00:10:39.510 --> 00:10:41.560
<v Speaker 3>Follow me.</v>

171
00:10:42.740 --> 00:10:43.700
<v Speaker 1>I have no,</v>

172
00:10:43.850 --> 00:10:45.920
<v Speaker 3>a three</v>

173
00:10:46.890 --> 00:10:48.010
<v Speaker 4>for my,</v>

174

<v Speaker 1>hello.</v>
