1
00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:02.630
<v Speaker 1>Thank you to squarespace for sponsoring</v>
<v Speaker 1>this video.</v>

2
00:00:07.380 --> 00:00:12.380
<v Speaker 1>I think we can all agree that rogue one</v>
<v Speaker 1>is by no means a conventional entry into</v>

3
00:00:12.451 --> 00:00:15.810
<v Speaker 1>the Star Wars Saga,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the black and gray undertones of the</v>

4
00:00:15.811 --> 00:00:18.270
<v Speaker 1>opening sequence,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's boots on the ground,</v>

5
00:00:18.271 --> 00:00:22.110
<v Speaker 1>no nonsense approach to it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Story for veal early on that the film is</v>

6
00:00:22.111 --> 00:00:27.111
<v Speaker 1>the odd one out at a midst a long series</v>
<v Speaker 1>of familiar expectations taking place in</v>

7
00:00:27.511 --> 00:00:31.770
<v Speaker 1>between the overall darker and best and</v>
<v Speaker 1>mystic revenge of the sith and the more</v>

8
00:00:31.771 --> 00:00:36.390
<v Speaker 1>hopeful and optimistic and new hope.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It functions as a mediator of what we</v>

9
00:00:36.391 --> 00:00:39.270
<v Speaker 1>can call the Yin and the Yang of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>star wars saga.</v>

10
00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:42.510
<v Speaker 1>Bridging not only to chronological gap</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the timeline,</v>

11
00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:46.440
<v Speaker 1>but also and more importantly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>symbolically crossing the underlying</v>

12
00:00:46.470 --> 00:00:49.230
<v Speaker 1>tonal divide that exists between these</v>
<v Speaker 1>two films.</v>

13
00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:53.070
<v Speaker 1>This voyage begins close through the</v>
<v Speaker 1>darkness of revenge of the Sith,</v>

14
00:00:53.310 --> 00:00:56.280
<v Speaker 1>the young gender or so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and her family who have been hiding in</v>

15
00:00:56.281 --> 00:01:00.870
<v Speaker 1>the shadows of the galaxy are found by</v>
<v Speaker 1>the tyrannical empire who proceed to</v>

16
00:01:00.871 --> 00:01:03.690
<v Speaker 1>shoot her,</v>
<v Speaker 1>define mother and forced her genius</v>

17
00:01:03.691 --> 00:01:06.600
<v Speaker 1>fodder,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Gayland Urso to finish constructing the</v>

18
00:01:06.601 --> 00:01:08.850
<v Speaker 1>death star with the archetype of a</v>
<v Speaker 1>rental.</v>

19
00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:11.520
<v Speaker 1>Figures effectively eliminated the</v>
<v Speaker 1>film's opening.</v>

20
00:01:11.521 --> 00:01:14.970
<v Speaker 1>Sequence not only sets up Jen's</v>
<v Speaker 1>backstory as to protagonist,</v>

21
00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:19.590
<v Speaker 1>but it also symbolically establishes the</v>
<v Speaker 1>main dominating theme or undertone of</v>

22
00:01:19.591 --> 00:01:23.670
<v Speaker 1>roughly the first half of the film,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is the world at the bottom and in</v>

23
00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:26.340
<v Speaker 1>the shadow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fifteen years down the line,</v>

24
00:01:26.341 --> 00:01:30.480
<v Speaker 1>jen is shown to have become a criminal</v>
<v Speaker 1>and a prisoner in a remote imperial</v>

25
00:01:30.481 --> 00:01:33.450
<v Speaker 1>labor camp,</v>
<v Speaker 1>having grown disillusioned and cynical</v>

26
00:01:33.451 --> 00:01:36.360
<v Speaker 1>throughout the year,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she doesn't rejoice at the prospect of</v>

27
00:01:36.361 --> 00:01:39.630
<v Speaker 1>being rescued by the rebels,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but attempts to fight them off.</v>

28
00:01:39.631 --> 00:01:42.510
<v Speaker 1>Instead.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Her nihilistic worldview has made,</v>

29
00:01:42.511 --> 00:01:46.200
<v Speaker 1>are numb to any sort of belief or dream</v>
<v Speaker 1>anymore benevolent future.</v>

30
00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:50.340
<v Speaker 1>Her only interest are selfish in nature</v>
<v Speaker 1>and grounded at the bottom in the</v>

31
00:01:50.341 --> 00:01:54.270
<v Speaker 1>material world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can stand to see the imperial flag.</v>

32
00:01:54.860 --> 00:01:56.220
<v Speaker 1>Brain crossed,</v>

33
00:01:57.850 --> 00:01:58.800
<v Speaker 2>not a problem if you don't.</v>

34
00:01:59.750 --> 00:02:01.700
<v Speaker 1>The rebel alliance on it's Bart is</v>
<v Speaker 1>shown,</v>

35
00:02:01.701 --> 00:02:04.430
<v Speaker 1>fractured its members,</v>
<v Speaker 1>anxious and divided,</v>

36
00:02:04.610 --> 00:02:07.970
<v Speaker 1>separated by conflicting opinions on the</v>
<v Speaker 1>conduct of war.</v>

37
00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:11.210
<v Speaker 1>It's agents operating on the fringes of</v>
<v Speaker 1>morality.</v>

38
00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:13.460
<v Speaker 1>Gas.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ian is one of these agents and</v>

39
00:02:13.461 --> 00:02:17.140
<v Speaker 1>represents this inner conflict in his</v>
<v Speaker 1>struggle to live with the questionable</v>

40
00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:20.570
<v Speaker 1>things he sees himself forced to do in</v>
<v Speaker 1>servers off the rebellion,</v>

41
00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:23.870
<v Speaker 1>the alliances,</v>
<v Speaker 1>motives are seemingly egoic and</v>

42
00:02:23.871 --> 00:02:27.290
<v Speaker 1>dishonest in nature,</v>
<v Speaker 1>only having rescued gin as a means of</v>

43
00:02:27.291 --> 00:02:31.220
<v Speaker 1>getting to her father and lying to her</v>
<v Speaker 1>about the ultimate goal of the mission.</v>

44
00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:33.780
<v Speaker 2>Forget what you heard in that there will</v>
<v Speaker 2>be no extraction.</v>

45
00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:35.303
<v Speaker 2>You find him.</v>

46
00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:41.890
<v Speaker 1>This morally slippery slope is</v>
<v Speaker 1>accentuated by two character of Saul</v>

47
00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:44.020
<v Speaker 1>Guerrera,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the former mentor of gin and the leader</v>

48
00:02:44.021 --> 00:02:48.460
<v Speaker 1>of an extremist rebel cell function</v>
<v Speaker 1>somewhat as a cautionary tale for the</v>

49
00:02:48.461 --> 00:02:52.030
<v Speaker 1>alliance as a whole.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He and his men have been engaged in a</v>

50
00:02:52.031 --> 00:02:56.470
<v Speaker 1>brutal war against the empire and the</v>
<v Speaker 1>city of Jeddah booting civilian lives in</v>

51
00:02:56.471 --> 00:03:00.910
<v Speaker 1>danger and combating the imperials over</v>
<v Speaker 1>who the moral high ground in the city</v>

52
00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:05.860
<v Speaker 1>hiding in a crumbling desert cave with</v>
<v Speaker 1>his window into the world shattered saw</v>

53
00:03:05.861 --> 00:03:10.510
<v Speaker 1>has slowly become more machine than men</v>
<v Speaker 1>having grown exceedingly paranoid of</v>

54
00:03:10.511 --> 00:03:14.020
<v Speaker 1>others as his sanity and humanity</v>
<v Speaker 1>dwindled along the way.</v>

55
00:03:17.590 --> 00:03:20.680
<v Speaker 1>Moving beyond the merely human</v>
<v Speaker 1>representation of the world.</v>

56
00:03:20.681 --> 00:03:23.170
<v Speaker 1>At the bottom is the entire planet of</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jetta,</v>

57
00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:24.820
<v Speaker 1>a small desert.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Planet.</v>

58
00:03:24.821 --> 00:03:29.050
<v Speaker 1>Jetta was once a spiritual world of</v>
<v Speaker 1>worship for forest believers and to jet.</v>

59
00:03:29.051 --> 00:03:30.400
<v Speaker 1>I order.</v>
<v Speaker 1>However,</v>

60
00:03:30.401 --> 00:03:32.710
<v Speaker 1>when we get to see is a world in</v>
<v Speaker 1>decline,</v>

61
00:03:32.770 --> 00:03:36.490
<v Speaker 1>the giant statues of Ancient Jetta I</v>
<v Speaker 1>have fallen and are crumbling.</v>

62
00:03:36.820 --> 00:03:39.200
<v Speaker 1>It's city upon a hill like John</v>
<v Speaker 1>winthrop's,</v>

63
00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:42.460
<v Speaker 1>Massachusetts Bay colony.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was once a place for people to look</v>

64
00:03:42.461 --> 00:03:44.530
<v Speaker 1>up to a place of honor,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hope,</v>

65
00:03:44.710 --> 00:03:47.530
<v Speaker 1>justice,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the highest possible good in rogue</v>

66
00:03:47.531 --> 00:03:48.221
<v Speaker 1>one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>However,</v>

67
00:03:48.221 --> 00:03:52.030
<v Speaker 1>the city has fallen into decay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It streets ravaged by war.</v>

68
00:03:52.031 --> 00:03:54.670
<v Speaker 1>It's skies shrouded by a pyramid shape,</v>
<v Speaker 1>star,</v>

69
00:03:54.671 --> 00:03:57.250
<v Speaker 1>destroyer and ultimate symbol of bloated</v>
<v Speaker 1>order,</v>

70
00:03:57.430 --> 00:04:00.730
<v Speaker 1>and it's amongst roaming the streets</v>
<v Speaker 1>without purpose as dare temple is</v>

71
00:04:00.760 --> 00:04:05.760
<v Speaker 1>actively being plundered of its most</v>
<v Speaker 1>valuable resource guide holding these</v>

72
00:04:06.670 --> 00:04:10.930
<v Speaker 1>star crystals were formerly used to make</v>
<v Speaker 1>jet I lightsabers and our sources of the</v>

73
00:04:10.931 --> 00:04:14.710
<v Speaker 1>force of the light in the darkness</v>
<v Speaker 1>representing such things as order</v>

74
00:04:14.740 --> 00:04:17.590
<v Speaker 1>justice and moral good gins,</v>
<v Speaker 1>necklace holes,</v>

75
00:04:17.591 --> 00:04:20.170
<v Speaker 1>one of these stones which is noticed by</v>
<v Speaker 1>the blind monk Chirrut</v>

76
00:04:23.020 --> 00:04:26.200
<v Speaker 1>the first thing this quote seems to</v>
<v Speaker 1>address as Jen's inner journey,</v>

77
00:04:26.230 --> 00:04:30.430
<v Speaker 1>perhaps implying that she should listen</v>
<v Speaker 1>to to deepest urgings over hard to let</v>

78
00:04:30.431 --> 00:04:35.140
<v Speaker 1>go of her apathetic nature and to move</v>
<v Speaker 1>yourself upwards towards a higher</v>

79
00:04:35.141 --> 00:04:38.350
<v Speaker 1>purpose to become a beacon of light in</v>
<v Speaker 1>the darkness.</v>

80
00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:42.220
<v Speaker 1>The second preference comes into form of</v>
<v Speaker 1>the newly constructed Deathstar,</v>

81
00:04:42.640 --> 00:04:46.720
<v Speaker 1>which powered by the ems crystals from</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jetta possesses eight literal heart of</v>

82
00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:50.450
<v Speaker 1>Geiber to director Orson Krennic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This literal manifestation gold,</v>

83
00:04:50.460 --> 00:04:54.760
<v Speaker 1>a star powered by Dick Lehman Crystal</v>
<v Speaker 1>will ultimately translate into a better</v>

84
00:04:54.761 --> 00:04:59.761
<v Speaker 1>world to providing peace cured.</v>
<v Speaker 1>However,</v>

85
00:05:00.671 --> 00:05:04.180
<v Speaker 1>it is notion of the absolute order of</v>
<v Speaker 1>light becomes instead something</v>

86
00:05:04.240 --> 00:05:08.620
<v Speaker 1>pathological and highly destructive,</v>
<v Speaker 1>symbolically suggesting that a world</v>

87
00:05:08.621 --> 00:05:13.090
<v Speaker 1>with too much light or too much order is</v>
<v Speaker 1>just as bad as a world consumed by</v>

88
00:05:13.091 --> 00:05:16.570
<v Speaker 1>darkness and chaos.</v>
<v Speaker 1>These two notions of lightness as moral</v>

89
00:05:16.571 --> 00:05:20.550
<v Speaker 1>good and the danger of the excess of</v>
<v Speaker 1>light then come together at the climax</v>

90
00:05:20.560 --> 00:05:24.430
<v Speaker 1>of the jetta sequence gins,</v>
<v Speaker 1>existing inner cynical beliefs are</v>

91
00:05:24.431 --> 00:05:28.960
<v Speaker 1>shattered when she's confronted with a</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hologram message of her long lost father</v>

92
00:05:29.260 --> 00:05:33.580
<v Speaker 1>speaking to her as to symbolical spirit</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the fodder to culture and the order</v>

93
00:05:33.581 --> 00:05:36.190
<v Speaker 1>that has been consumed by the tyranny of</v>
<v Speaker 1>the empire.</v>

94
00:05:36.400 --> 00:05:39.940
<v Speaker 1>He tells her of his true intentions to</v>
<v Speaker 1>eight to rebellion and the destruction</v>

95
00:05:39.941 --> 00:05:44.500
<v Speaker 1>of the deaths are down by leaving gin</v>
<v Speaker 1>with a message of hope and sacrificed to</v>

96
00:05:44.501 --> 00:05:47.770
<v Speaker 1>a higher purpose.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But at the same time of the resurrection</v>

97
00:05:47.771 --> 00:05:48.820
<v Speaker 1>of the wives.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Father,</v>

98
00:05:48.830 --> 00:05:53.260
<v Speaker 1>his tyrannical counterpart blooms high</v>
<v Speaker 1>above shrouding the light of the sun</v>

99
00:05:53.261 --> 00:05:58.150
<v Speaker 1>before finally destroying the remnants</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the old order like a god thunder on</v>

100
00:05:58.160 --> 00:06:03.020
<v Speaker 1>the people of his creation with the land</v>
<v Speaker 1>now shrouded in darkness and chaos.</v>

101
00:06:03.021 --> 00:06:05.060
<v Speaker 1>It's horizon rendered,</v>
<v Speaker 1>nonexistent.</v>

102
00:06:05.330 --> 00:06:10.330
<v Speaker 1>Saw Jim's father figure decides that he</v>
<v Speaker 1>will run no longer with his sacrifice,</v>

103
00:06:10.761 --> 00:06:14.630
<v Speaker 1>symbolizing the embracing of his own</v>
<v Speaker 1>darkness and his message of trust in a</v>

104
00:06:14.631 --> 00:06:17.480
<v Speaker 1>higher good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The group escapes not only death,</v>

105
00:06:17.510 --> 00:06:21.310
<v Speaker 1>but also manages to climb out of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>symbolical world at the bottom.</v>

106
00:06:21.860 --> 00:06:25.670
<v Speaker 1>The story then starts to take the shape</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the archetypical ascension journey</v>

107
00:06:25.830 --> 00:06:29.720
<v Speaker 1>that has its hero climb out of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>shadow is sending a mountain towards the</v>

108
00:06:29.721 --> 00:06:33.110
<v Speaker 1>highest possible,</v>
<v Speaker 1>good redeeming or changing himself and</v>

109
00:06:33.111 --> 00:06:35.330
<v Speaker 1>the people around him for the better at</v>
<v Speaker 1>the top.</v>

110
00:06:35.600 --> 00:06:39.800
<v Speaker 1>This upward journey in rogue one is then</v>
<v Speaker 1>mirrored by a descend into chaos and</v>

111
00:06:39.801 --> 00:06:44.180
<v Speaker 1>into the belly of the beast on the one</v>
<v Speaker 1>hand to embrace and overcome every</v>

112
00:06:44.181 --> 00:06:45.470
<v Speaker 1>character's personal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>dark,</v>

113
00:06:45.471 --> 00:06:47.570
<v Speaker 1>side or shadow,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and on the other hand,</v>

114
00:06:47.600 --> 00:06:51.860
<v Speaker 1>to save the spirit of the fodder which</v>
<v Speaker 1>holds the key to the reemergence of hope</v>

115
00:06:51.861 --> 00:06:56.120
<v Speaker 1>and a more benevolent order for gaseous.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This means that he has to confront the</v>

116
00:06:56.121 --> 00:07:00.890
<v Speaker 1>darker nonthinking side of his character</v>
<v Speaker 1>in order to free himself from the mental</v>

117
00:07:00.891 --> 00:07:02.360
<v Speaker 1>prison.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Net clouds is hard.</v>

118
00:07:02.420 --> 00:07:03.530
<v Speaker 1>It was more than once</v>

119
00:07:08.380 --> 00:07:10.520
<v Speaker 1>with the ultimate physical death will</v>
<v Speaker 1>for fodder.</v>

120
00:07:10.530 --> 00:07:15.370
<v Speaker 1>Gin on her part has to finally move</v>
<v Speaker 1>beyond her empathetic nature in favor of</v>

121
00:07:15.371 --> 00:07:18.550
<v Speaker 1>belief and hope and self sacrifice for a</v>
<v Speaker 1>higher good.</v>

122
00:07:18.790 --> 00:07:22.000
<v Speaker 1>I would argue that it's this change in</v>
<v Speaker 1>these two characters that slowly begins</v>

123
00:07:22.001 --> 00:07:26.110
<v Speaker 1>to trickle down into other individuals</v>
<v Speaker 1>and eventually the rebel collective as a</v>

124
00:07:26.111 --> 00:07:28.570
<v Speaker 1>whole.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jen and her broke one task force are</v>

125
00:07:28.571 --> 00:07:30.580
<v Speaker 1>really the tip of the spear of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>rebellion.</v>

126
00:07:30.610 --> 00:07:32.170
<v Speaker 1>They are at a bow and Arrow,</v>
<v Speaker 1>double,</v>

127
00:07:32.171 --> 00:07:35.590
<v Speaker 1>ultimately pointy entire alliance into a</v>
<v Speaker 1>new direction,</v>

128
00:07:35.830 --> 00:07:39.910
<v Speaker 1>embracing both the light and the dark</v>
<v Speaker 1>and individually choosing to sacrifice</v>

129
00:07:39.911 --> 00:07:44.140
<v Speaker 1>themselves for a greater good,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's exactly dispersonal sacrifice</v>

130
00:07:44.141 --> 00:07:48.370
<v Speaker 1>in service of a better future that</v>
<v Speaker 1>allows roque one to make it's final</v>

131
00:07:48.371 --> 00:07:52.570
<v Speaker 1>ascend to the top and to broadcast a</v>
<v Speaker 1>blueprint of the fodder that holds the</v>

132
00:07:52.571 --> 00:07:55.540
<v Speaker 1>key for a better world to reemerge down</v>
<v Speaker 1>the line.</v>

133
00:07:55.690 --> 00:07:59.950
<v Speaker 1>Because even though does sacrifice will</v>
<v Speaker 1>ultimately come at the cost of all of</v>

134
00:07:59.951 --> 00:08:03.400
<v Speaker 1>these characters lives,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it is not so much shown to be a negative</v>

135
00:08:03.460 --> 00:08:06.340
<v Speaker 1>as it is transcendent in his last</v>
<v Speaker 1>moments.</v>

136
00:08:06.341 --> 00:08:10.630
<v Speaker 1>The imperial defector Bodie overcome</v>
<v Speaker 1>this fear and shows courage in his heart</v>

137
00:08:10.631 --> 00:08:14.350
<v Speaker 1>as he establishes the radio connection</v>
<v Speaker 1>needed for the success of the mission.</v>

138
00:08:14.680 --> 00:08:17.330
<v Speaker 1>Witnessing the heroic demise of his</v>
<v Speaker 1>friend Charit.</v>

139
00:08:17.350 --> 00:08:21.910
<v Speaker 1>This skeptical realist base has a last</v>
<v Speaker 1>minute change of heart and finally puts</v>

140
00:08:21.911 --> 00:08:24.250
<v Speaker 1>his trust in to force horse.</v>

141
00:08:28.280 --> 00:08:32.240
<v Speaker 1>Even the analytical Kaytoo shows a sign</v>
<v Speaker 1>of humanity through his mechanical</v>

142
00:08:32.241 --> 00:08:35.880
<v Speaker 1>exterior in the end.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a line of courageous sacrifice</v>

143
00:08:35.881 --> 00:08:39.980
<v Speaker 1>based on hope and trust into force that</v>
<v Speaker 1>really all started with the define death</v>

144
00:08:40.010 --> 00:08:42.530
<v Speaker 1>of gins.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Mother followed by countless other</v>

145
00:08:42.531 --> 00:08:47.531
<v Speaker 1>allied characters from saw and galen to</v>
<v Speaker 1>numerous named and unnamed rebel marines</v>

146
00:08:47.541 --> 00:08:50.990
<v Speaker 1>and air force wings to cash in and jen</v>
<v Speaker 1>themselves.</v>

147
00:08:51.170 --> 00:08:54.770
<v Speaker 1>Their deaths are marked by an exuberant</v>
<v Speaker 1>and transcendent lightness,</v>

148
00:08:54.990 --> 00:08:58.950
<v Speaker 1>giving us a sense of redemption in a</v>
<v Speaker 1>positively charged sacrifice.</v>

149
00:08:59.160 --> 00:09:02.340
<v Speaker 1>And it's here at the battle of</v>
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible] that the rebel alliance has</v>

150
00:09:02.341 --> 00:09:06.840
<v Speaker 1>really defined setting itself apart from</v>
<v Speaker 1>the tyrannical pathology and destructive</v>

151
00:09:06.841 --> 00:09:11.340
<v Speaker 1>selfishness of the empire and not just</v>
<v Speaker 1>because of its physical action of moving</v>

152
00:09:11.370 --> 00:09:13.920
<v Speaker 1>out of the shadow and facing the empire</v>
<v Speaker 1>head on.</v>

153
00:09:14.160 --> 00:09:17.140
<v Speaker 1>But more importantly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because of the all of inspiring action</v>

154
00:09:17.230 --> 00:09:20.220
<v Speaker 1>of a select few individuals,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Roque one,</v>

155
00:09:20.221 --> 00:09:23.820
<v Speaker 1>demonstrates that to save oneself is to</v>
<v Speaker 1>save the galaxy.</v>

156
00:09:24.060 --> 00:09:28.560
<v Speaker 1>It's about having the courage to climb</v>
<v Speaker 1>out of the bottom of the pit to defy</v>

157
00:09:28.561 --> 00:09:31.350
<v Speaker 1>overwhelming darkness,</v>
<v Speaker 1>both without and within,</v>

158
00:09:31.670 --> 00:09:35.100
<v Speaker 1>and to move upwards and self sacrifice</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the ICO itself,</v>

159
00:09:35.130 --> 00:09:37.530
<v Speaker 1>in order to retrieve the spirit of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>father,</v>

160
00:09:37.970 --> 00:09:40.860
<v Speaker 1>it's to emulate his star with a heart of</v>
<v Speaker 1>Cairo,</v>

161
00:09:41.160 --> 00:09:45.240
<v Speaker 1>to be an inspiration for others to do</v>
<v Speaker 1>the same in hopes of manifesting a</v>

162
00:09:45.241 --> 00:09:46.620
<v Speaker 1>better future for all.</v>

163
00:09:48.480 --> 00:09:49.470
