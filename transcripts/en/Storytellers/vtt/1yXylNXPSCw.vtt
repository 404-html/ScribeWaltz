1
00:00:02.690 --> 00:00:06.950
<v Speaker 1>I think the dark nights racist will</v>
<v Speaker 1>always be remembered as a film that just</v>

2
00:00:06.980 --> 00:00:09.560
<v Speaker 1>couldn't quite step out of the shadow of</v>
<v Speaker 1>its predecessor.</v>

3
00:00:09.620 --> 00:00:11.990
<v Speaker 1>The dark nights,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I think we all know who's</v>

4
00:00:12.020 --> 00:00:13.160
<v Speaker 1>responsible for this.</v>

5
00:00:15.370 --> 00:00:18.040
<v Speaker 1>Good evening,</v>
<v Speaker 1>ladies and gentle man.</v>

6
00:00:21.670 --> 00:00:26.670
<v Speaker 1>We are tonight's entertainment.</v>
<v Speaker 1>However,</v>

7
00:00:26.891 --> 00:00:30.280
<v Speaker 1>we can see the dark nights rises on its</v>
<v Speaker 1>own not only as a good,</v>

8
00:00:30.340 --> 00:00:34.360
<v Speaker 1>if not excellent film births as a</v>
<v Speaker 1>closure of the trilogy that's perfectly</v>

9
00:00:34.361 --> 00:00:38.080
<v Speaker 1>built upon and resource the inner</v>
<v Speaker 1>struggle of Batman that has been built</v>

10
00:00:38.081 --> 00:00:40.840
<v Speaker 1>up within the previous films.</v>
<v Speaker 1>To do this,</v>

11
00:00:40.841 --> 00:00:43.180
<v Speaker 1>however,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we must first reject to political</v>

12
00:00:43.181 --> 00:00:47.500
<v Speaker 1>readings of the film that dominated for</v>
<v Speaker 1>fuse and discussions on the dark knight</v>

13
00:00:47.501 --> 00:00:50.410
<v Speaker 1>rises.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We do this by first exploring the ways</v>

14
00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:54.010
<v Speaker 1>in which Christopher Nolan constructs</v>
<v Speaker 1>narratives and then showing the</v>

15
00:00:54.011 --> 00:00:58.210
<v Speaker 1>underlying psychological symbolism to</v>
<v Speaker 1>which the personal story of the dark</v>

16
00:00:58.211 --> 00:01:00.040
<v Speaker 1>knight that's rices escape.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There</v>

17
00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:14.730
<v Speaker 1>now in many refuse and discussions of</v>
<v Speaker 1>the dark knight rises the supposed</v>

18
00:01:14.731 --> 00:01:18.900
<v Speaker 1>political meaning of the film.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's a central topic I have discussed</v>

19
00:01:18.901 --> 00:01:20.130
<v Speaker 1>before,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how in Juneau,</v>

20
00:01:20.131 --> 00:01:24.570
<v Speaker 1>many reviewers and pundits mistakenly</v>
<v Speaker 1>focused on Juno supposed political</v>

21
00:01:24.571 --> 00:01:29.310
<v Speaker 1>message considering abortion and</v>
<v Speaker 1>motherhood's a similar fate has befallen</v>

22
00:01:29.311 --> 00:01:33.420
<v Speaker 1>the dark knight rises Cosworth the</v>
<v Speaker 1>reviewers and pundits clave that the</v>

23
00:01:33.421 --> 00:01:37.500
<v Speaker 1>dark knight rises also clear and it's</v>
<v Speaker 1>important conservative message.</v>

24
00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:40.500
<v Speaker 1>According to them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the dark knight rises shows perfectly.</v>

25
00:01:40.501 --> 00:01:44.810
<v Speaker 1>The evil of leftist political revolution</v>
<v Speaker 1>is beans for Toric,</v>

26
00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:48.960
<v Speaker 1>not the same as that of a Marxist</v>
<v Speaker 1>revolutionary leader or even closer to</v>

27
00:01:48.961 --> 00:01:51.660
<v Speaker 1>home as death of the occupy Wall Street</v>
<v Speaker 1>movement.</v>

28
00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:57.530
<v Speaker 2>Take Gotham from dark car rock.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Those are generations who have kept you</v>

29
00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:08.120
<v Speaker 2>down with myths of I'll put shoes on a</v>
<v Speaker 2>team and we give it back to you.</v>

30
00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:11.080
<v Speaker 2>The people.</v>

31
00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:16.760
<v Speaker 1>Roundup is yours.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A sentencing trials.</v>

32
00:02:16.761 --> 00:02:19.640
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the spires by the trials of the French</v>

33
00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:22.640
<v Speaker 1>Revolution as conservative pundits,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ben Shapiro states,</v>

34
00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:25.640
<v Speaker 3>dark knight rises was probably not even</v>
<v Speaker 3>meant to be a conservative movie.</v>

35
00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:28.730
<v Speaker 3>The entire movie is a diatribe about</v>
<v Speaker 3>Marxism and the French revolution.</v>

36
00:02:28.731 --> 00:02:30.700
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's including a full trial,</v>

37
00:02:30.701 --> 00:02:32.360
<v Speaker 3>seen a mock trial team.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

38
00:02:32.361 --> 00:02:33.410
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's fantastic.</v>

39
00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:36.900
<v Speaker 1>Even more so.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It is the police as representatives of</v>

40
00:02:36.901 --> 00:02:39.510
<v Speaker 1>order and establishment,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the together with,</v>

41
00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:43.020
<v Speaker 1>well for Fuck Sake,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a billionaire defend the city against</v>

42
00:02:43.021 --> 00:02:47.100
<v Speaker 1>this Marxist revolution of the people</v>
<v Speaker 1>and who are higher of the ferry left</v>

43
00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:51.120
<v Speaker 1>progressive websites alone,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even dare to call the Dark Knight</v>

44
00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:53.700
<v Speaker 1>Advices,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a fascist movie stating the Mesas are</v>

45
00:02:53.701 --> 00:02:57.240
<v Speaker 1>the Philippines and the one time</v>
<v Speaker 1>overlords are the heroes.</v>

46
00:02:57.690 --> 00:03:01.930
<v Speaker 1>Although some conservatives to celebrate</v>
<v Speaker 1>Christopher Nolan as much need as</v>

47
00:03:01.931 --> 00:03:06.220
<v Speaker 1>conservative voice in Liberal Hollywood.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He himself was surprised by these</v>

48
00:03:06.221 --> 00:03:11.110
<v Speaker 1>political interpretations of his film.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He stated what was surprising to me is</v>

49
00:03:11.111 --> 00:03:15.220
<v Speaker 1>how many pundits booth right about the</v>
<v Speaker 1>political interpretation of the film and</v>

50
00:03:15.221 --> 00:03:19.360
<v Speaker 1>not understand that any one political</v>
<v Speaker 1>interpretation necessarily involve</v>

51
00:03:19.390 --> 00:03:22.870
<v Speaker 1>ignoring huge chunks of the film.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nolan argued death.</v>

52
00:03:22.871 --> 00:03:27.550
<v Speaker 1>He simply tried to expose tensions in</v>
<v Speaker 1>society that somebody could exploit and</v>

53
00:03:27.551 --> 00:03:31.060
<v Speaker 1>that you can get falsely different</v>
<v Speaker 1>political interpretations from the</v>

54
00:03:31.061 --> 00:03:32.910
<v Speaker 1>movie.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Slash Boise Sec,</v>

55
00:03:32.911 --> 00:03:35.860
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>stated that there is very much a strange</v>

56
00:03:35.861 --> 00:03:39.940
<v Speaker 1>attraction and excitement in the film</v>
<v Speaker 1>considering the idea of power to the</v>

57
00:03:39.941 --> 00:03:42.810
<v Speaker 1>people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He can see this for example in catwoman</v>

58
00:03:42.850 --> 00:03:46.450
<v Speaker 1>who so seductively whispers to our</v>
<v Speaker 1>billionaire protagonist.</v>

59
00:03:47.210 --> 00:03:52.210
<v Speaker 2>You think all this can last storm coming</v>
<v Speaker 2>story when your friends better because</v>

60
00:03:57.040 --> 00:04:01.810
<v Speaker 2>you're all kind of wonder how you ever</v>
<v Speaker 2>and leave.</v>

61
00:04:01.890 --> 00:04:02.723
<v Speaker 2>So</v>

62
00:04:06.670 --> 00:04:10.540
<v Speaker 1>and the strange satisfaction we gets</v>
<v Speaker 1>when Bain states who his employer,</v>

63
00:04:21.510 --> 00:04:22.350
<v Speaker 2>this gives you,</v>

64
00:04:23.720 --> 00:04:28.260
<v Speaker 1>Jesus concludes that the interpretation</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the dark knight rises as conservative</v>

65
00:04:28.290 --> 00:04:30.840
<v Speaker 1>or Liberal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have fewer sands for fewer assess more</v>

66
00:04:30.841 --> 00:04:35.340
<v Speaker 1>about them than about the film itself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now I think by focusing so much on the</v>

67
00:04:35.341 --> 00:04:38.850
<v Speaker 1>political meaning of the film,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we are not only missing the two team of</v>

68
00:04:38.851 --> 00:04:41.340
<v Speaker 1>the film,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but we are also fundamentally missing</v>

69
00:04:41.341 --> 00:04:44.040
<v Speaker 1>how Christopher Nolan Constructs his</v>
<v Speaker 1>narratives.</v>

70
00:04:44.220 --> 00:04:46.560
<v Speaker 1>The epidermis,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the film supposed to conservative</v>

71
00:04:46.561 --> 00:04:51.110
<v Speaker 1>message can be seen in the final clash</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the good guy police protectors of law</v>

72
00:04:51.111 --> 00:04:55.960
<v Speaker 1>and order to get her with Batman versus</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Marxists proletariats less by bane</v>

73
00:05:20.330 --> 00:05:21.390
<v Speaker 2>totally doors.</v>

74
00:05:24.690 --> 00:05:28.350
<v Speaker 1>But then it turns out that the true</v>
<v Speaker 1>pivotal scene of the film is the one</v>

75
00:05:28.351 --> 00:05:32.400
<v Speaker 1>that comes right off to this clash where</v>
<v Speaker 1>it is revealed that a real villain and</v>

76
00:05:32.401 --> 00:05:34.860
<v Speaker 1>leader of the League of shadows is</v>
<v Speaker 1>affect Miranda,</v>

77
00:05:34.920 --> 00:05:36.150
<v Speaker 1>Datto Frosto,</v>
<v Speaker 1>ghoul</v>

78
00:05:37.180 --> 00:05:40.860
<v Speaker 2>child Razia alcohol may decline.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then he's not the</v>

79
00:05:42.540 --> 00:05:47.540
<v Speaker 2>I</v>
<v Speaker 2>and the lime not ordinary.</v>

80
00:05:55.360 --> 00:05:58.370
<v Speaker 1>Such a plot twist is of course typical</v>
<v Speaker 1>for Christopher Nolan.</v>

81
00:05:58.520 --> 00:06:02.240
<v Speaker 1>Famous force layered complicated</v>
<v Speaker 1>narratives where nothing is but it</v>

82
00:06:02.241 --> 00:06:04.220
<v Speaker 1>seems.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

83
00:06:04.221 --> 00:06:08.570
<v Speaker 1>Walter Ben Michael's has analyzed</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nolan's narrative style and concluded</v>

84
00:06:08.571 --> 00:06:12.200
<v Speaker 1>that the key to notice plot twist is</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're building towards the twist.</v>

85
00:06:12.201 --> 00:06:15.140
<v Speaker 1>The information to see the twist coming</v>
<v Speaker 1>is already there.</v>

86
00:06:17.050 --> 00:06:19.810
<v Speaker 4>Never show anyone,</v>
<v Speaker 4>beg you,</v>

87
00:06:19.960 --> 00:06:22.600
<v Speaker 4>and they'll fly you for the secret,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but as soon as you give it up,</v>

88
00:06:23.650 --> 00:06:24.483
<v Speaker 4>you'll be nothing to</v>

89
00:06:25.410 --> 00:06:28.560
<v Speaker 1>he states for known as plot twists to be</v>
<v Speaker 1>successful,</v>

90
00:06:28.620 --> 00:06:32.370
<v Speaker 1>the audience must deceive itself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Must refuse to see the obvious</v>

91
00:06:32.371 --> 00:06:35.340
<v Speaker 1>explanation for what is in front of it's</v>
<v Speaker 1>very eyes.</v>

92
00:06:35.520 --> 00:06:39.630
<v Speaker 1>Nolan manipulates the audience desire to</v>
<v Speaker 1>be mystified by what they see.</v>

93
00:06:39.660 --> 00:06:43.470
<v Speaker 1>So deathly effect when the hidden</v>
<v Speaker 1>information is finally revealed,</v>

94
00:06:43.530 --> 00:06:47.340
<v Speaker 1>it's magnified indeed normalness called</v>
<v Speaker 1>filmic narrative itself.</v>

95
00:06:47.370 --> 00:06:50.750
<v Speaker 1>The controlled release of information,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nolan often heights,</v>

96
00:06:50.751 --> 00:06:54.810
<v Speaker 1>the information in elaborate layers of</v>
<v Speaker 1>narratives search as we can see in films</v>

97
00:06:54.811 --> 00:06:59.790
<v Speaker 1>like the Prestige Memento and inception.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now the narrative structure of the dark</v>

98
00:06:59.791 --> 00:07:03.150
<v Speaker 1>knight trilogy is more straight forward</v>
<v Speaker 1>than that of these fills,</v>

99
00:07:03.360 --> 00:07:06.840
<v Speaker 1>but Nolan's plot twists and hidden</v>
<v Speaker 1>information is still there.</v>

100
00:07:07.200 --> 00:07:10.410
<v Speaker 1>By rewatching the dark knight rises with</v>
<v Speaker 1>the plot twist in mind,</v>

101
00:07:10.440 --> 00:07:14.090
<v Speaker 1>we can see that the film central team</v>
<v Speaker 1>isn't a straight forward action hero</v>

102
00:07:14.100 --> 00:07:18.600
<v Speaker 1>clash off button and for us has been</v>
<v Speaker 1>both a completion of betterment's own</v>

103
00:07:18.601 --> 00:07:21.360
<v Speaker 1>psychological struggle in the dark</v>
<v Speaker 1>knight rises.</v>

104
00:07:21.361 --> 00:07:24.630
<v Speaker 1>We meet Bruce Wayne,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not only in a horrible physical state,</v>

105
00:07:24.690 --> 00:07:27.270
<v Speaker 1>but also in a horrible psychological</v>
<v Speaker 1>state.</v>

106
00:07:27.390 --> 00:07:31.530
<v Speaker 1>Still wallowing in the debt off Rachel</v>
<v Speaker 1>and by extension his parents,</v>

107
00:07:31.531 --> 00:07:34.170
<v Speaker 1>he cannot leave Gotham and the Batman</v>
<v Speaker 1>behind.</v>

108
00:07:34.800 --> 00:07:39.540
<v Speaker 4>I did find so I know and you lost him,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but that's all part of living sir,</v>

109
00:07:40.440 --> 00:07:42.270
<v Speaker 4>but you're not living.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're just waiting,</v>

110
00:07:42.300 --> 00:07:43.590
<v Speaker 4>hoping,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but things to go bad.</v>

111
00:07:43.591 --> 00:07:44.040
<v Speaker 4>Again.</v>

112
00:07:44.040 --> 00:07:48.300
<v Speaker 1>Nolan himself has set that gotten itself</v>
<v Speaker 1>is a symbol for Bruce Wayne's</v>

113
00:07:48.360 --> 00:07:51.130
<v Speaker 1>psychological state.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We can also find bruce ways,</v>

114
00:07:51.220 --> 00:07:54.870
<v Speaker 1>psychological struggle in the symbolic</v>
<v Speaker 1>objects of his mother's necklace.</v>

115
00:07:55.780 --> 00:07:58.840
<v Speaker 4>That's a beautiful necklace.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Reminds me of one that belonged to my</v>

116
00:07:58.841 --> 00:08:01.340
<v Speaker 4>mother.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Can't be the same</v>

117
00:08:03.280 --> 00:08:05.770
<v Speaker 1>cause.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Her pearls are in this safe,</v>

118
00:08:06.340 --> 00:08:09.250
<v Speaker 1>which is broken.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Rushees shut in Batman begins,</v>

119
00:08:09.280 --> 00:08:14.110
<v Speaker 1>but now it's reassembled by bruce and</v>
<v Speaker 1>kept in a safe before it got stolen by</v>

120
00:08:14.111 --> 00:08:18.070
<v Speaker 1>Serena Ak Catwoman.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This necklace in the film contains a</v>

121
00:08:18.071 --> 00:08:21.910
<v Speaker 1>whole array off symbolic gesturing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We can see it in Bruce repairing the</v>

122
00:08:21.911 --> 00:08:24.340
<v Speaker 1>necklace,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is symbolic for trying to heal his</v>

123
00:08:24.341 --> 00:08:28.390
<v Speaker 1>wounds to keeping it in a safe as</v>
<v Speaker 1>symbolic for trying to protect his</v>

124
00:08:28.391 --> 00:08:31.450
<v Speaker 1>wounded psych.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This use of a safe as a symbol to</v>

125
00:08:31.451 --> 00:08:36.070
<v Speaker 1>protect one psych is of course also seen</v>
<v Speaker 1>and one of nowness other films inception</v>

126
00:08:37.940 --> 00:08:41.510
<v Speaker 1>to bruce keeping us modest necklace.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We can see that he can't let go of the</v>

127
00:08:41.511 --> 00:08:44.900
<v Speaker 1>past and a distress.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not a coincidence that the woman who</v>

128
00:08:44.901 --> 00:08:48.410
<v Speaker 1>takes the necklace away from it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's also the woman who eventually is</v>

129
00:08:48.411 --> 00:08:51.230
<v Speaker 1>critical for Bruce being able to let go</v>
<v Speaker 1>of this past.</v>

130
00:08:53.120 --> 00:08:56.250
<v Speaker 4>Come with me.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Save</v>

131
00:08:56.250 --> 00:09:01.250

<v Speaker 2>You don't owe these people anymore.</v>

132
00:09:02.640 --> 00:09:04.260
<v Speaker 2>You've given them everything.</v>

133
00:09:04.790 --> 00:09:06.230
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>upon second viewing,</v>

134
00:09:06.231 --> 00:09:10.730
<v Speaker 1>we know that the true feeling of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>film is Miranda and she is very much</v>

135
00:09:10.760 --> 00:09:15.040
<v Speaker 1>parallel to Bruce Wayne's story,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but Bruce Wayne and Batman begins</v>

136
00:09:15.041 --> 00:09:16.520
<v Speaker 1>Wallace for French,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for a spouse.</v>

137
00:09:16.521 --> 00:09:19.180
<v Speaker 1>Death almost joined the League of</v>
<v Speaker 1>shadows.</v>

138
00:09:19.181 --> 00:09:21.150
<v Speaker 1>Bird thank creates Batman.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We run that.</v>

139
00:09:21.151 --> 00:09:24.890
<v Speaker 1>I had a similar faith where her mother</v>
<v Speaker 1>was killed by criminals as a father by</v>

140
00:09:24.891 --> 00:09:25.970
<v Speaker 1>Bruce Wayne.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>

141
00:09:25.971 --> 00:09:27.920
<v Speaker 1>she does.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Joined the League of shadows.</v>

142
00:09:33.570 --> 00:09:34.403
<v Speaker 2>Rick,</v>

143
00:09:38.760 --> 00:09:41.940
<v Speaker 1>in this video on the joker,</v>
<v Speaker 1>lessons from the screenplay explains the</v>

144
00:09:41.941 --> 00:09:45.930
<v Speaker 1>joker is an amazing antagonist because</v>
<v Speaker 1>he exploits the weaknesses of the</v>

145
00:09:45.931 --> 00:09:48.740
<v Speaker 1>protagonists,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Batman and that they both Bethel for the</v>

146
00:09:48.750 --> 00:09:51.480
<v Speaker 1>soft Gotham in the dark.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Knight rises.</v>

147
00:09:51.540 --> 00:09:54.760
<v Speaker 1>This is build upon.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We know that Beth man lost better for</v>

148
00:09:54.761 --> 00:09:59.190
<v Speaker 1>Gotham sold because it's Yoka turned</v>
<v Speaker 1>hockey dance and that's a piece in</v>

149
00:09:59.191 --> 00:10:04.110
<v Speaker 1>Godson is built upon the lie,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which Miranda through Bain exposes in</v>

150
00:10:04.111 --> 00:10:06.340
<v Speaker 1>the dark nights,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Bruce Chooses Rachel A.</v>

151
00:10:06.340 --> 00:10:08.500
<v Speaker 1>Ball off.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Harvey Dent who represents hopeful</v>

152
00:10:08.550 --> 00:10:10.470
<v Speaker 1>Gotham,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but she's still dice.</v>

153
00:10:11.030 --> 00:10:13.830
<v Speaker 2>All right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Listen some</v>

154
00:10:16.600 --> 00:10:17.850
<v Speaker 1>me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Rhonda as a villain,</v>

155
00:10:17.860 --> 00:10:19.020
<v Speaker 1>dust users,</v>
<v Speaker 1>bruises,</v>

156
00:10:19.021 --> 00:10:20.850
<v Speaker 1>weakest points,</v>
<v Speaker 1>his loneliness,</v>

157
00:10:20.851 --> 00:10:23.580
<v Speaker 1>his heartbreak,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and his desire to love a woman.</v>

158
00:10:23.930 --> 00:10:24.691
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Miranda,</v>

159
00:10:24.691 --> 00:10:28.740
<v Speaker 1>his true identity is of course carefully</v>
<v Speaker 1>hidden and therefore the central team of</v>

160
00:10:28.750 --> 00:10:31.080
<v Speaker 1>bruises,</v>
<v Speaker 1>psychological battle is as well.</v>

161
00:10:31.160 --> 00:10:32.670
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>upon rewatching the film,</v>

162
00:10:32.671 --> 00:10:36.480
<v Speaker 1>the information is always there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Offer plays an interesting role in this</v>

163
00:10:36.540 --> 00:10:38.430
<v Speaker 1>by stating his hope that bruce will</v>
<v Speaker 1>leave,</v>

164
00:10:38.431 --> 00:10:41.670
<v Speaker 1>gotten Beth and his boss behaves to find</v>
<v Speaker 1>happiness.</v>

165
00:10:41.671 --> 00:10:44.360
<v Speaker 1>He creates focus on the two central team</v>
<v Speaker 1>of Boucher.</v>

166
00:10:44.390 --> 00:10:45.600
<v Speaker 1>Psychological journey.</v>

167
00:10:45.810 --> 00:10:48.720
<v Speaker 2>I'll never one need you to come back to</v>
<v Speaker 2>Gotham.</v>

168
00:10:50.490 --> 00:10:52.500
<v Speaker 2>I waste no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there was nothing here for you.</v>

169
00:10:52.950 --> 00:10:57.420
<v Speaker 2>Pain and tragedy and I wanted something</v>
<v Speaker 2>more for you to know.</v>

170
00:10:58.260 --> 00:11:00.450
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's by explaining pain as a dangerous</v>

171
00:11:00.451 --> 00:11:04.320
<v Speaker 1>villain to bruce offered helps tricking.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The fewer into not seeing the two</v>

172
00:11:04.321 --> 00:11:05.580
<v Speaker 1>villain is Miranda</v>

173
00:11:06.490 --> 00:11:11.470
<v Speaker 4>who's a member of the League of shadows</v>
<v Speaker 4>and then he was actually indicating any</v>

174
00:11:11.471 --> 00:11:13.820
<v Speaker 4>man who is too extreme.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The ratio.</v>

175
00:11:15.010 --> 00:11:18.310
<v Speaker 4>There's not that the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I didn't realize I was known for</v>

176
00:11:18.400 --> 00:11:23.400
<v Speaker 4>trifling criminals.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That was Zane and you could just strap</v>

177
00:11:23.491 --> 00:11:25.540
<v Speaker 4>up your leg and put your mask back on.</v>

178
00:11:28.360 --> 00:11:30.650
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fred is the moral center of the trilogy,</v>

179
00:11:30.710 --> 00:11:33.680
<v Speaker 1>the Voice of Wisdom.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And especially when in the dark nights</v>

180
00:11:33.681 --> 00:11:36.570
<v Speaker 1>he so beautifully explained,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well it makes a joker tick.</v>

181
00:11:36.740 --> 00:11:41.740
<v Speaker 1>Some men just want to wash the world,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but when he explains why Bain is so</v>

182
00:11:42.171 --> 00:11:43.940
<v Speaker 1>dangerous,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we fully believe him.</v>

183
00:11:44.300 --> 00:11:47.180
<v Speaker 1>Even when we see Miranda suggests a fee</v>
<v Speaker 1>using mosques.</v>

184
00:11:47.360 --> 00:11:50.360
<v Speaker 1>Ethan when the camera focuses on the</v>
<v Speaker 1>scar on her back there,</v>

185
00:11:50.361 --> 00:11:53.860
<v Speaker 1>she got from the League of shadows and</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ethan will be clear to see that the</v>

186
00:11:53.861 --> 00:11:58.150
<v Speaker 1>child or the escapes is a girl that even</v>
<v Speaker 1>some of looks like Miranda and doesn't</v>

187
00:11:58.151 --> 00:12:01.480
<v Speaker 1>have to suppose scars,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Death Bain receives in the pit because</v>

188
00:12:01.481 --> 00:12:03.610
<v Speaker 1>we believe all threats.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We do not see it.</v>

189
00:12:04.060 --> 00:12:05.650
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>To information is there.</v>

190
00:12:05.800 --> 00:12:09.500
<v Speaker 1>The thematic resolution of the dark</v>
<v Speaker 1>knight rises isn't Batman Wins.</v>

191
00:12:09.501 --> 00:12:14.140
<v Speaker 1>Spain loses this conservatism wins</v>
<v Speaker 1>occupy losers because Bain isn't the</v>

192
00:12:14.141 --> 00:12:17.230
<v Speaker 1>coal antagonist of the film and if you</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't see this,</v>

193
00:12:17.231 --> 00:12:20.950
<v Speaker 1>then we also missed the importance of</v>
<v Speaker 1>the second twist of the film where we</v>

194
00:12:20.951 --> 00:12:22.990
<v Speaker 1>find out that that man is not death</v>
<v Speaker 1>birth,</v>

195
00:12:22.991 --> 00:12:26.350
<v Speaker 1>indeed the life and that he did truly</v>
<v Speaker 1>leave behind the Batman,</v>

196
00:12:26.560 --> 00:12:28.540
<v Speaker 1>Gotham and bane of his past.</v>

197
00:12:29.060 --> 00:12:33.340
<v Speaker 1>The dark knight rises is not about a</v>
<v Speaker 1>fiscally broken Beth man that rises out</v>

198
00:12:33.341 --> 00:12:37.030
<v Speaker 1>of the pit through defeat Bain.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's about Bruce Wayne who rises out of</v>

199
00:12:37.031 --> 00:12:40.150
<v Speaker 1>his psychological pain to leave the</v>
<v Speaker 1>death of his parents.</v>

200
00:12:40.240 --> 00:12:43.030
<v Speaker 1>Rachel,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the city of Carson and his persona as</v>

201
00:12:43.031 --> 00:12:44.830
<v Speaker 1>Batman truly behind.</v>

202
00:13:14.480 --> 00:13:17.060
<v Speaker 1>Thank you all so much for watching.</v>

<v Speaker 1>while some main inspiration for this</v>

205
00:13:21.801 --> 00:13:26.540
<v Speaker 1>video and also two lessons from the</v>
<v Speaker 1>screenplay who gave me the ID to explore</v>

206
00:13:26.541 --> 00:13:28.600
<v Speaker 1>the last installment of the Dark Knight</v>
<v Speaker 1>Trilogy.</v>

207
00:13:28.610 --> 00:13:30.590
<v Speaker 1>Further,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's going to be the joker,</v>

208
00:13:30.591 --> 00:13:34.100
<v Speaker 1>but there are certainly an important</v>
<v Speaker 1>deeper theme in the last film death</v>

209
00:13:34.101 --> 00:13:37.970
<v Speaker 1>closest Bruce's journey.</v>

00:13:44.931 --> 00:13:47.660
<v Speaker 1>loosely about the film as my essay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I will,</v>

213
00:13:47.661 --> 00:13:50.360
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>explore other symbolic gestures and</v>

214
00:13:50.361 --> 00:13:53.930
<v Speaker 1>explain why so many pundits and</v>
<v Speaker 1>reviewers didn't see the underlying</v>

215
00:13:53.931 --> 00:13:56.590
<v Speaker 1>central team,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but instead focused on the supposed</v>

216
00:13:56.591 --> 00:14:00.170
<v Speaker 1>political arc of better than the first</v>
<v Speaker 1>has been for everyone else.</v>

217
00:14:00.440 --> 00:14:01.370
<v Speaker 1>See you next time.</v>
