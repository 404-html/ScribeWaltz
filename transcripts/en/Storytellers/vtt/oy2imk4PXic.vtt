<v Speaker 2>Really relating to these archetypes in</v>
<v Speaker 2>the master.</v>

5
00:00:20.860 --> 00:00:25.860
<v Speaker 2>You don't have energy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you will not have a sense of</v>

6
00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:32.420
<v Speaker 2>if they have</v>
<v Speaker 2>that stuff out in ways that are</v>

7
00:00:33.631 --> 00:00:35.220
<v Speaker 2>destructive coming from you and others.</v>

8
00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:40.260
<v Speaker 3>What is masculinity?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Is it an outdated and overall</v>

9
00:00:40.261 --> 00:00:45.261
<v Speaker 3>destructive construct or is it a</v>
<v Speaker 3>necessary aspect of our humanity and the</v>

10
00:00:45.301 --> 00:00:48.840
<v Speaker 3>maturation of the individual?</v>
<v Speaker 3>These are some of the questions that</v>

11
00:00:48.841 --> 00:00:52.980
<v Speaker 3>pervade the work of Michael Mann in</v>
<v Speaker 3>general and his film collateral in</v>

12
00:00:52.981 --> 00:00:57.480
<v Speaker 3>particular because even though it's</v>
<v Speaker 3>story of a gabby being forced to drive a</v>

13
00:00:57.481 --> 00:01:01.650
<v Speaker 3>contract at killer from hit to hit</v>
<v Speaker 3>during one night in la might seem</v>

14
00:01:01.651 --> 00:01:03.210
<v Speaker 3>shallow.</v>
<v Speaker 3>On the surface level,</v>

15
00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:07.230
<v Speaker 3>I believe it's symbolic and thematic</v>
<v Speaker 3>structure provides a meaningful</v>

16
00:01:07.231 --> 00:01:11.310
<v Speaker 3>meditation on what it means to adopt</v>
<v Speaker 3>they healthy masculinity and what</v>

17
00:01:11.311 --> 00:01:14.950
<v Speaker 3>happens when we attempt to repress it</v>
<v Speaker 3>within ourselves and our societies.</v>

18
00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:21.910
<v Speaker 3>In one of his early seminars,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Dr [inaudible] discussed the</v>

19
00:01:21.911 --> 00:01:26.490
<v Speaker 3>mythological symbol of the men or the</v>
<v Speaker 3>rider and the bull and the necessity of</v>

20
00:01:26.491 --> 00:01:30.240
<v Speaker 3>taming once interval,</v>
<v Speaker 3>once masculine and animal nature.</v>

21
00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:35.130
<v Speaker 3>It is still the old hero cold of the man</v>
<v Speaker 3>who was capable of teaming his own bull</v>

22
00:01:35.131 --> 00:01:38.070
<v Speaker 3>like fashions,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the man who can overcome himself as</v>

23
00:01:38.071 --> 00:01:43.071
<v Speaker 3>almost a god and soda man who a has</v>
<v Speaker 3>deemed himself he's overcome his fears.</v>

24
00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:46.590
<v Speaker 3>Thus,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the catching of the ball in the net is</v>

25
00:01:46.591 --> 00:01:49.410
<v Speaker 3>an age old symbol for the self education</v>
<v Speaker 3>of men.</v>

26
00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:53.610
<v Speaker 3>When we're first introduced to Max,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we initially get a sentence that this is</v>

27
00:01:53.611 --> 00:01:56.520
<v Speaker 3>a man who's got his life together.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He used to Gabby,</v>

28
00:01:56.521 --> 00:01:59.700
<v Speaker 3>who goes above and beyond to keep things</v>
<v Speaker 3>orderly and clean.</v>

29
00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:04.380
<v Speaker 3>He used to driver who knows his roots by</v>
<v Speaker 3>heart and ain't for maximum efficiency</v>

30
00:02:04.540 --> 00:02:09.270
<v Speaker 3>and take the 105 to 1:10 this fast,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but he's also a people's person</v>

31
00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:12.780
<v Speaker 3>perceptive in his ability to put himself</v>
<v Speaker 3>in his passenger shoes,</v>

32
00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:18.030
<v Speaker 3>compassionate to their struggles,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to take the ticket because you needed a</v>

33
00:02:18.031 --> 00:02:21.420
<v Speaker 3>lot more than I do.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Next is a man who excels at what he</v>

34
00:02:21.421 --> 00:02:22.710
<v Speaker 3>does,</v>
<v Speaker 3>who blends them,</v>

35
00:02:22.711 --> 00:02:26.940
<v Speaker 3>doing so much more limo company.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm putting together island limos and</v>

36
00:02:26.941 --> 00:02:30.900
<v Speaker 3>who even gets the number of the girl he</v>
<v Speaker 3>likes without even having to ask for it.</v>

37
00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:36.560
<v Speaker 3>Max Truly seems to have it all.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not until after a mysterious man</v>

38
00:02:37.261 --> 00:02:40.650
<v Speaker 3>from out of town and enters a scab that</v>
<v Speaker 3>the facade begins to crumble.</v>

39
00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:42.360
<v Speaker 4>Denver,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

40
00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:45.290
<v Speaker 4>you been driving 12 years.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Really</v>

41
00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:48.330
<v Speaker 1>suddenly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Max is excellence and orderliness as a</v>

42
00:02:48.331 --> 00:02:52.770
<v Speaker 1>cab driver are exposed to be barred if</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a weakness for in reality,</v>

43
00:02:52.771 --> 00:02:57.480
<v Speaker 1>Max is all order.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No risk it chronic clunker of life like</v>

44
00:02:57.481 --> 00:03:02.140
<v Speaker 1>a faceless writer or missing action.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's become complacent,</v>

45
00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:04.720
<v Speaker 1>stuck in a routine,</v>
<v Speaker 1>afraid of getting dirty,</v>

46
00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:08.530
<v Speaker 1>of taking a chance.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If the girl he likes of delving into the</v>

47
00:03:08.531 --> 00:03:12.100
<v Speaker 1>unknown of facing his inner bull,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why don't you just take the cat?</v>

48
00:03:12.970 --> 00:03:15.840
<v Speaker 1>Is Realistic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ambitions have turned into an escapist</v>

49
00:03:15.850 --> 00:03:20.500
<v Speaker 1>dream meant to deceive himself as well</v>
<v Speaker 1>as others from facing his reality.</v>

50
00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:23.860
<v Speaker 1>He grabs famous people around limousine</v>
<v Speaker 1>companies,</v>

51
00:03:23.861 --> 00:03:27.880
<v Speaker 1>and that's what an achievement for.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's when we repress our inner</v>

52
00:03:27.881 --> 00:03:30.940
<v Speaker 1>masculinity,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when we don't listen to our instincts,</v>

53
00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:33.850
<v Speaker 1>forfeit our assertiveness,</v>
<v Speaker 1>our healthy aggression,</v>

54
00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:38.860
<v Speaker 1>you tell them to take next cab,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and when we don't take responsibility</v>

55
00:03:38.861 --> 00:03:41.470
<v Speaker 1>for our lives,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that life itself becomes rigid,</v>

56
00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:43.390
<v Speaker 1>constricting,</v>
<v Speaker 1>claustrophobic,</v>

57
00:03:43.391 --> 00:03:46.300
<v Speaker 1>even the car becomes not a symbol of</v>
<v Speaker 1>freedom,</v>

58
00:03:46.600 --> 00:03:50.380
<v Speaker 1>but one of bondage in a world seemingly</v>
<v Speaker 1>indifferent to our existence</v>

59
00:03:52.930 --> 00:03:55.690
<v Speaker 1>like Max,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we might dream or deceive ourselves and</v>

60
00:03:55.691 --> 00:03:57.880
<v Speaker 1>others into believing that nothing is</v>
<v Speaker 1>wrong,</v>

61
00:03:58.060 --> 00:04:00.430
<v Speaker 1>but in reality when we repress our inner</v>
<v Speaker 1>bull,</v>

62
00:04:00.431 --> 00:04:03.610
<v Speaker 1>we've become small,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the pendant harmless and therefore</v>

63
00:04:03.611 --> 00:04:04.444
<v Speaker 1>vulnerable.</v>

64
00:04:04.510 --> 00:04:09.070
<v Speaker 1>Not much more than cogs in a machine</v>
<v Speaker 1>marionettes stuck in an endless loop</v>

65
00:04:09.190 --> 00:04:11.890
<v Speaker 1>naively waiting for the universe to give</v>
<v Speaker 1>us our do.</v>

66
00:04:12.620 --> 00:04:14.630
<v Speaker 4>Someday,</v>
<v Speaker 4>someday my dream will come</v>

67
00:04:16.220 --> 00:04:18.260
<v Speaker 4>when you wake up and you'll discover it</v>
<v Speaker 4>never happened.</v>

68
00:04:18.990 --> 00:04:22.860
<v Speaker 1>You can avoid places where bools are to</v>
<v Speaker 1>be found and if you don't see them,</v>

69
00:04:22.861 --> 00:04:26.190
<v Speaker 1>you will not be bothered,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you must be dodging all the time in</v>

70
00:04:26.191 --> 00:04:28.610
<v Speaker 1>order to avoid every possibility of a</v>
<v Speaker 1>rousing.</v>

71
00:04:29.340 --> 00:04:32.550
<v Speaker 1>And since life provides endless</v>
<v Speaker 1>opportunities for the emotions,</v>

72
00:04:32.551 --> 00:04:37.170
<v Speaker 1>there is no end of dodging which amounts</v>
<v Speaker 1>to a panic or a chronic flunking of</v>

73
00:04:37.171 --> 00:04:40.650
<v Speaker 1>life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Vincent is in all aspects the opposite</v>

74
00:04:40.651 --> 00:04:42.030
<v Speaker 1>of Max,</v>
<v Speaker 1>his shadow.</v>

75
00:04:42.480 --> 00:04:46.500
<v Speaker 1>He seems to fully identify with the</v>
<v Speaker 1>masculinity of the symbolic bull.</v>

76
00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:50.190
<v Speaker 1>Everything Max is not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He shows himself to be assertive,</v>

77
00:04:50.220 --> 00:04:51.570
<v Speaker 1>alert,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and most of all,</v>

78
00:04:51.571 --> 00:04:56.571
<v Speaker 1>aggressive and unpredictable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If Max is constricted by too much order</v>

79
00:04:59.701 --> 00:05:02.730
<v Speaker 1>and routine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Vincent relishes in chaos and</v>

80
00:05:02.731 --> 00:05:03.780
<v Speaker 1>improvisation</v>

81
00:05:03.950 --> 00:05:06.930
<v Speaker 4>tough now behind the notes,</v>
<v Speaker 4>not what's expected.</v>

82
00:05:07.660 --> 00:05:08.493
<v Speaker 4>Compromise.</v>

83
00:05:09.840 --> 00:05:13.510
<v Speaker 1>And yet vincent is not the perfect</v>
<v Speaker 1>manifestation of the writer who is</v>

84
00:05:13.511 --> 00:05:17.580
<v Speaker 1>deemed the passions of the bull.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He believes that compassion and emotion</v>

85
00:05:17.581 --> 00:05:20.280
<v Speaker 1>of Max to be a hypocritical weakness of</v>
<v Speaker 1>character,</v>

86
00:05:20.310 --> 00:05:24.390
<v Speaker 1>tens of thousands kill before sundown.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nobody's killed people that fastens,</v>

87
00:05:24.391 --> 00:05:26.970
<v Speaker 1>Nagasaki and Hiroshima.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Did you bat an Imax?</v>

88
00:05:27.090 --> 00:05:31.590
<v Speaker 1>Do Vincent who grew up in an abusive</v>
<v Speaker 1>household life has no inherent meaning</v>

89
00:05:31.591 --> 00:05:34.350
<v Speaker 1>or value.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the people who claim the opposite</v>

90
00:05:34.351 --> 00:05:35.490
<v Speaker 1>are lying to themselves.</v>

91
00:05:35.530 --> 00:05:37.780
<v Speaker 4>Six hours.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's riding the subway before anybody</v>

92
00:05:37.781 --> 00:05:41.730
<v Speaker 4>notices his corpse doing laps around La</v>
<v Speaker 4>people on an opposite next to him.</v>

93
00:05:43.390 --> 00:05:44.350
<v Speaker 4>Nobody notices.</v>

94
00:05:44.730 --> 00:05:48.380
<v Speaker 5>I didn't notice the way he shot.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He shot as a part of the landscape.</v>

95
00:05:48.590 --> 00:05:52.010
<v Speaker 5>All that kind of stuff was to kind of</v>
<v Speaker 5>make him feel like an animal in la,</v>

96
00:05:52.280 --> 00:05:55.730
<v Speaker 5>that he is a product of this great urban</v>
<v Speaker 5>sprawl that we live in,</v>

97
00:05:55.731 --> 00:05:56.564
<v Speaker 5>kind of a thing.</v>

98
00:05:57.140 --> 00:05:58.370
<v Speaker 1>Vincent is a product</v>

99
00:05:58.370 --> 00:06:03.370
<v Speaker 6>of modern urban society,</v>
<v Speaker 6>an extreme rationalist nihilist his gray</v>

100
00:06:03.651 --> 00:06:06.530
<v Speaker 6>and colorless attire,</v>
<v Speaker 6>revealing his inner hollowness</v>

101
00:06:06.980 --> 00:06:10.280
<v Speaker 6>ultimately act only to prove as</v>
<v Speaker 6>resentful belief that the world is</v>

102
00:06:10.281 --> 00:06:11.570
<v Speaker 6>disconnected,</v>
<v Speaker 6>cruel,</v>

103
00:06:11.571 --> 00:06:15.140
<v Speaker 6>and indifferent to existence or bringing</v>
<v Speaker 6>death and misery jewelers.</v>

104
00:06:15.620 --> 00:06:19.550
<v Speaker 6>Vincent has become possessed by what</v>
<v Speaker 6>Robert Moore termed the archetypical</v>

105
00:06:19.590 --> 00:06:23.090
<v Speaker 6>shadow warrior,</v>
<v Speaker 6>the destructive side of masculinity.</v>

106
00:06:23.300 --> 00:06:26.450
<v Speaker 6>He's become detached from emotion and</v>
<v Speaker 6>human relationships.</v>

107
00:06:26.630 --> 00:06:31.310
<v Speaker 6>He's disgusted by human pettiness and</v>
<v Speaker 6>weakness and lifts only for his mission</v>

108
00:06:31.790 --> 00:06:33.780
<v Speaker 6>to him,</v>
<v Speaker 6>the emotional bastions of the bull</v>

109
00:06:33.800 --> 00:06:36.410
<v Speaker 6>orbits,</v>
<v Speaker 6>silly constructs of society or the human</v>

110
00:06:36.411 --> 00:06:41.060
<v Speaker 6>imagination ultimately holding one back</v>
<v Speaker 6>from taking unrestrained action to</v>

111
00:06:41.061 --> 00:06:42.320
<v Speaker 6>achieve one's goals.</v>

112
00:06:44.410 --> 00:06:47.780
<v Speaker 6>He takes what he needs from it.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Symbolic animal for his own egoistic</v>

113
00:06:47.781 --> 00:06:51.780
<v Speaker 6>needs and things he can leave to carcass</v>
<v Speaker 6>behind Giran now,</v>

114
00:06:51.790 --> 00:06:55.640
<v Speaker 6>double should not be killed.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It is not a bull sacrifice because we</v>

115
00:06:55.641 --> 00:06:59.240
<v Speaker 6>have learned what that means.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It means that you are deprived of life,</v>

116
00:06:59.360 --> 00:07:03.290
<v Speaker 6>drained if the very juice of life,</v>
<v Speaker 6>if you kill the emotional powers in</v>

117
00:07:03.291 --> 00:07:05.690
<v Speaker 6>yourself,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you get absolutely petrifying,</v>

118
00:07:05.750 --> 00:07:09.770
<v Speaker 6>dried up that therefore you must try to</v>
<v Speaker 6>keep that ball live under certain</v>

119
00:07:09.771 --> 00:07:12.710
<v Speaker 6>conditions symbolized by the net and the</v>
<v Speaker 6>tight feed.</v>

120
00:07:12.980 --> 00:07:16.720
<v Speaker 6>The ball must live,</v>
<v Speaker 6>and so as these two opposites embarked</v>

121
00:07:16.721 --> 00:07:20.720
<v Speaker 6>together on their murderous night,</v>
<v Speaker 6>an interplay of personalities and sue's</v>

122
00:07:20.990 --> 00:07:25.760
<v Speaker 6>visually Max's self-contained window</v>
<v Speaker 6>into the world is cracked and his life</v>

123
00:07:25.761 --> 00:07:29.120
<v Speaker 6>is thrown into chaos.</v>
<v Speaker 6>After you realize the true identity of</v>

124
00:07:29.121 --> 00:07:33.320
<v Speaker 6>his diabolical passenger,</v>
<v Speaker 6>as he drives Vincent from hit to hit,</v>

125
00:07:33.321 --> 00:07:37.490
<v Speaker 6>his own insufficiency becomes clear as</v>
<v Speaker 6>the veil of his lying is slowly being</v>

126
00:07:37.491 --> 00:07:38.140
<v Speaker 6>lifted.</v>

127
00:07:38.140 --> 00:07:41.060
<v Speaker 6>I'm not up for this and as much as you'd</v>
<v Speaker 6>love to escape,</v>

128
00:07:41.061 --> 00:07:44.630
<v Speaker 6>his reality is dependence on others will</v>
<v Speaker 6>only bring him in the world.</v>

129
00:07:44.631 --> 00:07:46.340
<v Speaker 6>More pain.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You attract attention.</v>

130
00:07:46.341 --> 00:07:48.350
<v Speaker 6>You're going to get people killed.</v>
<v Speaker 6>He didn't need to be.</v>

131
00:07:48.740 --> 00:07:52.940
<v Speaker 6>He stuck into cab in the enclosed arena</v>
<v Speaker 6>with his bull beside him.</v>

132
00:07:53.660 --> 00:07:57.800
<v Speaker 6>The only way out is to move forward into</v>
<v Speaker 6>the unknown and it's in spending time</v>

133
00:07:57.801 --> 00:07:59.960
<v Speaker 6>with him that he slowly becomes more</v>
<v Speaker 6>comfortable,</v>

134
00:08:00.140 --> 00:08:03.020
<v Speaker 6>more level headed,</v>
<v Speaker 6>and begins to learn from Vincent's</v>

135
00:08:03.021 --> 00:08:06.890
<v Speaker 6>behavior slowly becoming more assertive.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I'm going to have to stick this yellow</v>

136
00:08:06.891 --> 00:08:11.891
<v Speaker 6>cab of your fat ass and improvisational</v>
<v Speaker 6>to realization dawns on Max that the</v>

137
00:08:14.301 --> 00:08:18.650
<v Speaker 6>only way to survive the night and to</v>
<v Speaker 6>beat Vincent is to be like Vincent.</v>

138
00:08:19.100 --> 00:08:23.130
<v Speaker 6>The only way to team to dangerous bull</v>
<v Speaker 6>is to consciously act like the bull.</v>

139
00:08:23.450 --> 00:08:27.020
<v Speaker 6>One of the aspects of that becoming a</v>
<v Speaker 6>man is becoming dangerous if you're not</v>

140
00:08:27.021 --> 00:08:32.021
<v Speaker 6>dangerous.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Power masking the maturation has to do</v>

141
00:08:33.500 --> 00:08:38.500
<v Speaker 6>with being empowered and knowing how to</v>
<v Speaker 6>use it and when not to use.</v>

142
00:08:39.480 --> 00:08:42.780
<v Speaker 1>Tell the guy behind me to put his gun</v>
<v Speaker 1>away before I take it into Peter's</v>

143
00:08:42.790 --> 00:08:45.990
<v Speaker 1>bitter as definitely an embodying.</v>
<v Speaker 1>His inner vincent.</v>

144
00:08:46.080 --> 00:08:49.920
<v Speaker 1>Max has discovered a new found power he</v>
<v Speaker 1>previously didn't know he had,</v>

145
00:08:50.280 --> 00:08:54.780
<v Speaker 1>but by acting like the board of warrior,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's always the danger of becoming or</v>

146
00:08:54.781 --> 00:08:56.340
<v Speaker 1>being as its opposite</v>

147
00:08:57.160 --> 00:09:00.720
<v Speaker 3>Vincent Vincent.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So what I'm hearing seemingly blurring</v>

148
00:09:00.721 --> 00:09:03.600
<v Speaker 3>the line between the warrior and it's</v>
<v Speaker 3>shadow counterpart,</v>

149
00:09:03.630 --> 00:09:06.990
<v Speaker 3>confusing to police on who the real</v>
<v Speaker 3>hitman is supposed to be.</v>

150
00:09:07.700 --> 00:09:09.930
<v Speaker 3>It is only through to murder of</v>
<v Speaker 3>detective fenning.</v>

151
00:09:09.931 --> 00:09:12.840
<v Speaker 3>That then since true ethological nature</v>
<v Speaker 3>is exposed,</v>

152
00:09:12.900 --> 00:09:14.880
<v Speaker 4>there's no reason,</v>
<v Speaker 4>good reason,</v>

153
00:09:14.881 --> 00:09:17.760
<v Speaker 4>there's no bad reason they've ordered</v>
<v Speaker 4>that a cop.</v>

154
00:09:17.761 --> 00:09:20.770
<v Speaker 4>You may</v>
<v Speaker 4>notice this</v>

155
00:09:21.720 --> 00:09:26.130
<v Speaker 3>in complete shock of incense.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Nihilistic worldview Max makes a final</v>

156
00:09:26.131 --> 00:09:30.420
<v Speaker 3>move towards the completion of his inner</v>
<v Speaker 3>journey by taking full responsibility</v>

157
00:09:30.421 --> 00:09:31.254
<v Speaker 3>for his life</v>

158
00:09:31.700 --> 00:09:35.880
<v Speaker 4>straight up and looked at it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Sure.</v>

159
00:09:36.860 --> 00:09:40.640
<v Speaker 3>His own hesitance to act,</v>
<v Speaker 3>his passive defendants have caused them</v>

160
00:09:40.641 --> 00:09:44.960
<v Speaker 3>to stagnate in life,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is weakness in lines if not only held</v>

161
00:09:44.961 --> 00:09:47.510
<v Speaker 3>himself back,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but have also contributed to the</v>

162
00:09:47.511 --> 00:09:52.511
<v Speaker 3>suffering of others is fail of the seed</v>
<v Speaker 3>has now been lifted completely and can</v>

163
00:09:52.581 --> 00:09:55.260
<v Speaker 3>therefore exists.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No longer you don't want that's</v>

164
00:09:57.010 --> 00:10:02.010
<v Speaker 3>fucked yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Is deliberate.</v>

165
00:10:02.871 --> 00:10:06.320
<v Speaker 3>Crashing of this gap then becomes an</v>
<v Speaker 3>image of a symbolic death and</v>

166
00:10:06.321 --> 00:10:11.321
<v Speaker 3>resurrection is shedding of weakness.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The marionette dies and a writer arises.</v>

167
00:10:12.440 --> 00:10:15.860
<v Speaker 3>The bull has been teamed and the shadow</v>
<v Speaker 3>warrior has failed in his attempt to</v>

168
00:10:15.861 --> 00:10:19.100
<v Speaker 3>convert him into his ranks.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And the sleeves is sign,</v>

169
00:10:19.460 --> 00:10:22.820
<v Speaker 3>but there's one more step needed for Max</v>
<v Speaker 3>to complete his inner journey,</v>

170
00:10:23.250 --> 00:10:28.250
<v Speaker 6>the capacity to be a long time on</v>
<v Speaker 6>whether or not you can care enough or</v>

171
00:10:29.421 --> 00:10:34.421
<v Speaker 6>something that is totally unrelated to</v>
<v Speaker 6>your personal interests that you can see</v>

172
00:10:37.340 --> 00:10:38.173
<v Speaker 6>the trend,</v>

173
00:10:38.760 --> 00:10:43.760
<v Speaker 3>egoic,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Max strength sentences own being by</v>

174
00:10:44.371 --> 00:10:49.350
<v Speaker 3>sacrificing his own safety in order to</v>
<v Speaker 3>save the woman he cares about who also</v>

175
00:10:49.351 --> 00:10:53.490
<v Speaker 3>comes to represent the society as a</v>
<v Speaker 3>whole in her role as assistant attorney.</v>

176
00:10:54.030 --> 00:10:58.140
<v Speaker 3>And so by taking responsibility,</v>
<v Speaker 3>by embodying the archetype of the</v>

177
00:10:58.141 --> 00:11:00.870
<v Speaker 3>warrior,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Max is not only fighting for another</v>

178
00:11:00.871 --> 00:11:03.780
<v Speaker 3>individual,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but for the good of society as a whole.</v>

179
00:11:04.320 --> 00:11:08.220
<v Speaker 3>He surprises to shadow warrior and this</v>
<v Speaker 3>new found ability to take decisive</v>

180
00:11:08.221 --> 00:11:09.020
<v Speaker 3>action.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Why?</v>

181
00:11:09.020 --> 00:11:14.020
<v Speaker 3>What are you going to do about it?</v>
<v Speaker 3>But he also exposes the weakness and</v>

182
00:11:14.071 --> 00:11:17.400
<v Speaker 3>Vincent's character.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Max ultimately does not win the final</v>

183
00:11:17.401 --> 00:11:20.910
<v Speaker 3>clash because of his competence with</v>
<v Speaker 3>firearms or through his aggression,</v>

184
00:11:21.250 --> 00:11:25.500
<v Speaker 3>but by improvising on the spot.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Whereas Vincent sticks to is rigid and</v>

185
00:11:25.501 --> 00:11:30.501
<v Speaker 3>pathological nature to sternum.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When the head is inability to</v>

186
00:11:30.841 --> 00:11:34.320
<v Speaker 3>emotionally connect with others,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and the one person who made himself</v>

187
00:11:34.321 --> 00:11:37.770
<v Speaker 3>conscious of is flawed nature ultimately</v>
<v Speaker 3>become his downfall.</v>

188
00:11:38.310 --> 00:11:42.840
<v Speaker 3>He stoically accepts death almost as</v>
<v Speaker 3>part of his job and yet in his final</v>

189
00:11:42.841 --> 00:11:44.010
<v Speaker 3>words,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we hear it a boy,</v>

190
00:11:44.011 --> 00:11:46.500
<v Speaker 3>so he broken men,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a forgotten child.</v>

191
00:11:46.960 --> 00:11:50.490
<v Speaker 3>It's on the MTA.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Hearing guys</v>

192
00:11:55.270 --> 00:11:59.860
<v Speaker 3>for Max life begins again.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The repressed passive men who started</v>

193
00:11:59.861 --> 00:12:04.420
<v Speaker 3>the night is no more in display stands a</v>
<v Speaker 3>writer with a ball in this net.</v>

194
00:12:05.080 --> 00:12:07.780
<v Speaker 3>He is not killed it for he knows it to</v>
<v Speaker 3>be impossible,</v>

195
00:12:07.960 --> 00:12:09.430
<v Speaker 3>naive,</v>
<v Speaker 3>immoral,</v>

196
00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:12.790
<v Speaker 3>and so yes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>tamed his masculinity without becoming</v>

197
00:12:12.791 --> 00:12:15.520
<v Speaker 3>possessed by,</v>
<v Speaker 3>by embodying his inner pool,</v>

198
00:12:15.521 --> 00:12:19.000
<v Speaker 3>not for chaos and destruction,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but for the good of himself and those</v>

199
00:12:19.001 --> 00:12:22.120
<v Speaker 3>around him.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He opens the door to a meaningful life,</v>

200
00:12:22.510 --> 00:12:25.450
<v Speaker 3>to an existence with purpose to a new</v>
<v Speaker 3>beginning</v>

201
00:12:30.400 --> 00:12:34.270
<v Speaker 7>is the cause.</v>
<v Speaker 7>We have such a little experience of the</v>

202
00:12:34.280 --> 00:12:39.280
<v Speaker 7>positive side of this and where your mum</v>
<v Speaker 7>that we become so cynical and sometimes</v>

203
00:12:39.801 --> 00:12:44.750
<v Speaker 7>even I listed about masculinity and</v>
<v Speaker 7>begin to equate masculinity was</v>

204
00:12:44.780 --> 00:12:48.440
<v Speaker 7>patriarchy,</v>
<v Speaker 7>which is very common and intellectual</v>

205
00:12:48.441 --> 00:12:53.441
<v Speaker 7>rounds today in my view.</v>
<v Speaker 7>The two are not to be equated at all at</v>

206
00:12:53.661 --> 00:12:54.494
<v Speaker 7>all.</v>
