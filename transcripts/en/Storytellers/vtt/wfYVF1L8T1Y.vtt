00:00:04.420 --> 00:00:08.500
<v Speaker 1>It was shortly after meeting drones,</v>
<v Speaker 1>tracter Fitch that I realized that</v>

2
00:00:08.501 --> 00:00:11.860
<v Speaker 1>joining the Marine Corps might've been a</v>
<v Speaker 1>bad decision.</v>

3
00:00:12.470 --> 00:00:14.290
<v Speaker 1>All right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>come from brains.</v>

4
00:00:14.740 --> 00:00:17.350
<v Speaker 1>Show me exactly where your stubies I'm</v>
<v Speaker 1>running.</v>

5
00:00:17.690 --> 00:00:20.490
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I never boot camp instructors doing</v>

6
00:00:20.491 --> 00:00:22.520
<v Speaker 1>amount of tech.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What?</v>

7
00:00:22.521 --> 00:00:26.620
<v Speaker 1>I'm giving you a few love taps.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How the fuck are you going to fire your</v>

8
00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:29.570
<v Speaker 1>right bow when grenades are going up in</v>
<v Speaker 1>your face?</v>

9
00:00:30.730 --> 00:00:33.540
<v Speaker 1>What the fuck are you even doing here?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sorry,</v>

10
00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:37.840
<v Speaker 1>I got lost on the [inaudible].</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

11
00:00:47.290 --> 00:00:50.820
<v Speaker 2>Now some of you might've noticed that</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've placed the original opening sound</v>

12
00:00:50.821 --> 00:00:52.660
<v Speaker 2>check of giants,</v>
<v Speaker 2>bobby mcferrin.</v>

13
00:00:52.690 --> 00:00:54.750
<v Speaker 2>Don't worry,</v>
<v Speaker 2>be happy with the opening sound.</v>

14
00:00:54.751 --> 00:00:57.700
<v Speaker 2>Check off the 90 86 film full metal</v>
<v Speaker 2>jackets.</v>

15
00:00:57.850 --> 00:00:59.590
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>although I have copyright reasons for</v>

16
00:00:59.591 --> 00:01:02.170
<v Speaker 2>this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I also think it's essential to analyze</v>

17
00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:06.490
<v Speaker 2>jarhead within the context of full metal</v>
<v Speaker 2>jacket because of its similarities,</v>

18
00:01:06.491 --> 00:01:08.800
<v Speaker 2>birth even more because of its</v>
<v Speaker 2>differences.</v>

19
00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:13.980
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>jars refuse upon release were quite</v>

20
00:01:13.981 --> 00:01:17.890
<v Speaker 2>mixed and many were even negative.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Leslie Valparin described jarred as</v>

21
00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:20.490
<v Speaker 2>critical as claimed that it has little</v>
<v Speaker 2>new to say,</v>

22
00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:23.610
<v Speaker 2>and Joshua Moon stated that the film</v>
<v Speaker 2>goes nowhere,</v>

23
00:01:24.290 --> 00:01:27.030
<v Speaker 2>but two major paradoxical criticism</v>
<v Speaker 2>stood out.</v>

24
00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:31.890
<v Speaker 2>Joe teachy claimed that barely a frame</v>
<v Speaker 2>wheel feel to remind it's audience off</v>

25
00:01:31.891 --> 00:01:35.580
<v Speaker 2>another seminar war movie.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's effectively the Iraq of date.</v>

26
00:01:35.581 --> 00:01:36.660
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>full metal jacket.</v>

27
00:01:36.690 --> 00:01:37.471
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All this claim,</v>

28
00:01:37.471 --> 00:01:40.830
<v Speaker 2>the film fell out of genre as a warm</v>
<v Speaker 2>movie since there were no battles being</v>

29
00:01:40.831 --> 00:01:42.210
<v Speaker 2>fought.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>

30
00:01:42.211 --> 00:01:46.230
<v Speaker 2>I was argued that in this paradox of</v>
<v Speaker 2>both relying on other warfiles while</v>

31
00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:48.940
<v Speaker 2>also not adhering to the Warfield Sharma</v>
<v Speaker 2>lays,</v>

32
00:01:48.941 --> 00:01:50.940
<v Speaker 2>jr has cental team.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>

33
00:01:50.941 --> 00:01:54.630
<v Speaker 2>both films start out with a brutal</v>
<v Speaker 2>bootcamp off the United States Marine</v>

34
00:01:54.631 --> 00:01:57.180
<v Speaker 2>Corps.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The recruits are broken down into films,</v>

35
00:01:57.181 --> 00:01:58.490
<v Speaker 2>both through verbal sauce</v>

36
00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:01.090
<v Speaker 1>or you have a girlfriend.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Swapper sorry,</v>

37
00:02:01.091 --> 00:02:02.980
<v Speaker 1>I started this again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>mother fucker.</v>

38
00:02:02.981 --> 00:02:07.060
<v Speaker 1>Jody's banging her right now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Get on your face and give me 25 per</v>

39
00:02:07.061 --> 00:02:10.660
<v Speaker 1>every time she gets fucked.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This month down on your face</v>

40
00:02:10.870 --> 00:02:12.250
<v Speaker 2>and through physical training.</v>

41
00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:17.280
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's right.</v>

42
00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:20.480
<v Speaker 3>Private mile.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Don't make any fucking up to get up to</v>

43
00:02:20.481 --> 00:02:23.980
<v Speaker 3>the top of the fucking cops to go.</v>
<v Speaker 3>God want to do up there.</v>

44
00:02:23.981 --> 00:02:26.290
<v Speaker 3>He went up very cold.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Your ass up there by now.</v>

45
00:02:26.291 --> 00:02:29.200
<v Speaker 3>One night.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Get your bags up there.</v>

46
00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:31.700
<v Speaker 3>Pile.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The hell is the matter with your buddy.</v>

47
00:02:31.701 --> 00:02:33.910
<v Speaker 3>What?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I bet you if there was some punchy up</v>

48
00:02:33.911 --> 00:02:36.460
<v Speaker 3>there on top of that off,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can get up there,</v>

49
00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:37.900
<v Speaker 3>Joe.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

50
00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:42.080
<v Speaker 2>John resembles this process closely to</v>
<v Speaker 2>watch what is shown in full metal jacket</v>

51
00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:45.860
<v Speaker 2>from the verbal assault and equal</v>
<v Speaker 2>woodless nurse without racism.</v>

52
00:02:45.861 --> 00:02:46.694
<v Speaker 2>Speech.</v>

53
00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:48.860
<v Speaker 4>No ratio.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Bigger three here.</v>

54
00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:52.100
<v Speaker 4>I do not look down on niggers cuts.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What?</v>

55
00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:53.590
<v Speaker 4>They're grazer.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Hey,</v>

56
00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:58.640
<v Speaker 4>are you all all equally worthless?</v>
<v Speaker 4>You are no longer black or brown or</v>

57
00:02:59.020 --> 00:03:02.260
<v Speaker 4>yellow or red.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You are now,</v>

58
00:03:03.460 --> 00:03:08.460
<v Speaker 4>you are like food or dark boon.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Do you understand</v>

59
00:03:10.490 --> 00:03:11.400
<v Speaker 3>any car?</v>

60
00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:15.990
<v Speaker 2>Two to the glorification of marine</v>
<v Speaker 2>marksman ship and reshaping of marines</v>

61
00:03:15.991 --> 00:03:17.370
<v Speaker 2>into coal hearts killers.</v>

62
00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:22.700
<v Speaker 5>The Marine Corps does not want robots.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The Marine Corps wants killers.</v>

63
00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:27.510
<v Speaker 5>The Marine Corps wants to build</v>
<v Speaker 5>indestructable men.</v>

64
00:03:27.970 --> 00:03:29.360
<v Speaker 3>We're going to kick a rock.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>

65
00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:32.320
<v Speaker 3>Oh hell son.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What are you going to win the medal of</v>

66
00:03:32.321 --> 00:03:35.380
<v Speaker 3>honor all by yourself?</v>
<v Speaker 3>What's the rest of my battalion going to</v>

67
00:03:35.381 --> 00:03:36.214
<v Speaker 3>do?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Jake?</v>

68
00:03:36.330 --> 00:03:37.650
<v Speaker 3>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

69
00:03:37.660 --> 00:03:41.650
<v Speaker 3>I think it's time for me to retire.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I can't hear how fucking day</v>

70
00:03:44.950 --> 00:03:46.260
<v Speaker 3>I just got off.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Hard off.</v>

71
00:03:55.650 --> 00:03:57.930
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it is in the second part by jar has</v>

72
00:03:57.931 --> 00:04:00.450
<v Speaker 2>quickly starts to differ from</v>
<v Speaker 2>expectations.</v>

73
00:04:00.660 --> 00:04:04.650
<v Speaker 2>Jarheads shows us the marines in the</v>
<v Speaker 2>deserts aware that there a war going on</v>

74
00:04:04.690 --> 00:04:06.390
<v Speaker 2>that's enabled to participate.</v>

75
00:04:08.690 --> 00:04:09.490
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

76
00:04:09.490 --> 00:04:13.210
<v Speaker 3>Suggested techniques for the marine to</v>
<v Speaker 3>use and the avoidance of boredom and</v>

77
00:04:13.211 --> 00:04:16.210
<v Speaker 3>loneliness.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Masturbation,</v>

78
00:04:17.860 --> 00:04:20.740
<v Speaker 3>rereading of letters from unfaithful</v>
<v Speaker 3>wives and girlfriends,</v>

79
00:04:22.780 --> 00:04:26.440
<v Speaker 3>cleaning your rifle,</v>
<v Speaker 3>further masturbation.</v>

80
00:04:28.170 --> 00:04:31.520
<v Speaker 2>It is here where the central team of</v>
<v Speaker 2>chartered slowly becomes apparent.</v>

81
00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:34.600
<v Speaker 2>Our full metal jacket is critical of the</v>
<v Speaker 2>Marine corpse and the war.</v>

82
00:04:34.630 --> 00:04:38.950
<v Speaker 2>The marines went a full combat in</v>
<v Speaker 2>Vietnam are functioning even when chaos,</v>

83
00:04:38.951 --> 00:04:42.580
<v Speaker 2>psoriasis in the heat of battle,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they prevail and return back to order.</v>

84
00:04:43.540 --> 00:04:45.850
<v Speaker 2>However,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in jarhead the second part of the movie</v>

85
00:04:45.851 --> 00:04:50.200
<v Speaker 2>is a long and grueling process of</v>
<v Speaker 2>waiting boredom and living in the desert</v>

86
00:04:50.230 --> 00:04:53.290
<v Speaker 2>without any contact with outside world</v>
<v Speaker 2>back home.</v>

87
00:04:53.291 --> 00:04:56.110
<v Speaker 2>Life goes on and their relationships</v>
<v Speaker 2>fall apart.</v>

88
00:05:02.740 --> 00:05:05.920
<v Speaker 3>She up there yet.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Don't worry,</v>

89
00:05:05.921 --> 00:05:07.260
<v Speaker 3>she will.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She'll be right there.</v>

90
00:05:07.510 --> 00:05:09.600
<v Speaker 3>She's going to look beautiful up there.</v>

91
00:05:10.560 --> 00:05:15.150
<v Speaker 2>The Marines aimlessly patrolled the</v>
<v Speaker 2>deserts in harbor oilfields get bombed</v>

92
00:05:15.151 --> 00:05:18.840
<v Speaker 2>by mortars but never see the enemy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It is here that the film breaks with</v>

93
00:05:18.841 --> 00:05:20.970
<v Speaker 2>hands.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Robert Jars calls to your rising of</v>

94
00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:24.150
<v Speaker 2>expectations,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the viewer's expectations of a war</v>

95
00:05:24.151 --> 00:05:28.410
<v Speaker 2>film and the Marines expectations off</v>
<v Speaker 2>the work at Cheddar before the marines</v>

96
00:05:28.411 --> 00:05:30.450
<v Speaker 2>leave.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The film shows them getting riled up</v>

97
00:05:30.451 --> 00:05:33.870
<v Speaker 2>with the perspective of to grow his ride</v>
<v Speaker 2>of the valkyries scene in apocalypse</v>

98
00:05:33.871 --> 00:05:36.240
<v Speaker 2>now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>shaping their few or fought a war will</v>

99
00:05:36.241 --> 00:05:37.074
<v Speaker 2>be like</v>

100
00:06:01.990 --> 00:06:06.990
<v Speaker 7>all personnel are to report immediately</v>
<v Speaker 7>to your company or</v>

101
00:06:09.480 --> 00:06:10.313
<v Speaker 3>yes,</v>

102
00:06:13.710 --> 00:06:15.910
<v Speaker 2>you to spend this juxtaposition to film</v>
<v Speaker 2>state.</v>

103
00:06:15.911 --> 00:06:19.650
<v Speaker 2>Something about a different sort of wars</v>
<v Speaker 2>and the experiences of the marines in</v>

104
00:06:19.651 --> 00:06:20.900
<v Speaker 2>these wars.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's one of them.</v>

105
00:06:20.901 --> 00:06:22.980
<v Speaker 2>Reads,</v>
<v Speaker 2>realizes how different this blog will</v>

106
00:06:22.981 --> 00:06:23.970
<v Speaker 2>be.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He Commons.</v>

107
00:06:24.200 --> 00:06:25.880
<v Speaker 3>Look around.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You hear those fights.</v>

108
00:06:26.300 --> 00:06:28.190
<v Speaker 3>This board's going to move too fast for</v>
<v Speaker 3>us.</v>

109
00:06:28.570 --> 00:06:31.340
<v Speaker 3>All right,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we can shoot a thousand yards to go that</v>

110
00:06:31.341 --> 00:06:35.360
<v Speaker 3>far and Vietnam and take a week or one a</v>
<v Speaker 3>year here.</v>

111
00:06:35.600 --> 00:06:39.620
<v Speaker 3>Can I take about 10 fucking seconds?</v>
<v Speaker 3>By the time we have our rifles style,</v>

112
00:06:39.650 --> 00:06:41.360
<v Speaker 3>the war is going to be a mile down the</v>
<v Speaker 3>road</v>

113
00:06:43.040 --> 00:06:43.873
<v Speaker 3>wake up.</v>

114
00:06:44.650 --> 00:06:47.650
<v Speaker 2>But besides the new technological</v>
<v Speaker 2>reality of the war,</v>

115
00:06:47.710 --> 00:06:51.790
<v Speaker 2>the more important statement to feel</v>
<v Speaker 2>makes is on the psychological impact of</v>

116
00:06:51.791 --> 00:06:55.630
<v Speaker 2>being in the war or in this case not</v>
<v Speaker 2>being in the war in a sense,</v>

117
00:06:55.631 --> 00:06:59.650
<v Speaker 2>being broken down and then rebuild as</v>
<v Speaker 2>supposed Koolhaas killing marines in the</v>

118
00:06:59.651 --> 00:07:03.940
<v Speaker 2>Marine Corp bootcamp booth enabled to</v>
<v Speaker 2>apply this mindset and acquired skills</v>

119
00:07:03.941 --> 00:07:07.000
<v Speaker 2>leads to just as much of a mental</v>
<v Speaker 2>breakdown as the horror.</v>

120
00:07:07.001 --> 00:07:10.450
<v Speaker 2>So full combat.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The film shows us the slow descent of</v>

121
00:07:10.451 --> 00:07:12.700
<v Speaker 2>the marines into these mental breakdowns</v>
<v Speaker 2>with,</v>

122
00:07:12.701 --> 00:07:13.540
<v Speaker 2>of course,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Jake,</v>

123
00:07:13.540 --> 00:07:15.400
<v Speaker 2>Jen,</v>
<v Speaker 2>last character Swafford at the center,</v>

124
00:07:15.670 --> 00:07:19.510
<v Speaker 2>multiple moments than out one of the</v>
<v Speaker 2>marines breaks down when he finds out</v>

125
00:07:19.511 --> 00:07:20.890
<v Speaker 2>his wife is cheating on him.</v>

126
00:07:31.210 --> 00:07:32.043
<v Speaker 3>Sorry.</v>

127
00:07:32.190 --> 00:07:34.080
<v Speaker 2>When a fellow marine gets him into</v>
<v Speaker 2>trouble,</v>

128
00:07:34.200 --> 00:07:35.970
<v Speaker 2>swafford breaks down completely</v>

129
00:07:36.160 --> 00:07:37.960
<v Speaker 1>the fuck up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Shut the fuck up.</v>

130
00:07:38.710 --> 00:07:40.540
<v Speaker 1>Shut the fuck out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My repeat after me.</v>

131
00:07:41.870 --> 00:07:44.680
<v Speaker 1>This is my rifle.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There are many like it without me.</v>

132
00:07:44.681 --> 00:07:49.040
<v Speaker 1>My rifle</v>
<v Speaker 1>went down,</v>

133
00:07:49.420 --> 00:07:50.253
<v Speaker 1>my rifle,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I</v>

134
00:07:53.890 --> 00:07:55.000
<v Speaker 1>shut the fuck up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Shut the fuck.</v>

135
00:07:57.670 --> 00:07:59.690
<v Speaker 3>Fuck you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Show me.</v>

136
00:08:08.550 --> 00:08:09.383
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

137
00:08:11.280 --> 00:08:12.113
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>

138
00:08:15.630 --> 00:08:18.090
<v Speaker 2>And finally,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what Swafford gets a chance to shoot at</v>

139
00:08:18.091 --> 00:08:20.580
<v Speaker 2>an enemy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The opportunity is taken away at the</v>

140
00:08:20.581 --> 00:08:21.414
<v Speaker 2>last moment.</v>

141
00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:26.840
<v Speaker 3>This is all for fun anyway.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

142
00:08:26.870 --> 00:08:27.750
<v Speaker 3>wait,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not alive.</v>

143
00:08:28.430 --> 00:08:30.890
<v Speaker 3>What difference does it make you come</v>
<v Speaker 3>back to him?</v>

144
00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:38.000
<v Speaker 3>Because we got the Goddamn shut.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Your fucking desk jockey and the fucking</v>

145
00:08:49.600 --> 00:08:54.600
<v Speaker 3>bracket or</v>
<v Speaker 3>nope.</v>

146
00:09:12.030 --> 00:09:15.990
<v Speaker 2>The film shows us how to offer</v>
<v Speaker 2>experiences of this bar are completely</v>

147
00:09:15.991 --> 00:09:19.020
<v Speaker 2>different than from other wars you have.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Not less awful.</v>

148
00:09:19.290 --> 00:09:23.370
<v Speaker 2>It is this message that reconciles the</v>
<v Speaker 2>paradox of being a different war film</v>

149
00:09:23.430 --> 00:09:26.310
<v Speaker 2>and also leaning on its predecessors is</v>
<v Speaker 2>paradox,</v>

150
00:09:26.311 --> 00:09:29.820
<v Speaker 2>becomes the central team and is summed</v>
<v Speaker 2>up in the film in one sentence.</v>

151
00:09:30.390 --> 00:09:31.500
<v Speaker 2>Every worse,</v>
<v Speaker 2>different.</v>

152
00:09:37.070 --> 00:09:42.070
<v Speaker 2>Every war is the same</v>
<v Speaker 2>kettle drum</v>

153
00:09:46.210 --> 00:09:51.210
<v Speaker 2>swallow to boots.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Dale</v>

154
00:09:53.450 --> 00:09:54.283
