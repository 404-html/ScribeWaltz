1
00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:02.460
<v Speaker 1>Thank you to skillshare for sponsoring</v>
<v Speaker 1>this video.</v>

2
00:00:16.840 --> 00:00:21.120
<v Speaker 2>The clash of giant men and monsters is</v>
<v Speaker 2>eight powerful image that has a beard in</v>

3
00:00:21.121 --> 00:00:24.270
<v Speaker 2>many religion,</v>
<v Speaker 2>mythology and forth till throughout the</v>

4
00:00:24.271 --> 00:00:27.420
<v Speaker 2>ancient world,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it's a concept that in our secular,</v>

5
00:00:27.421 --> 00:00:31.050
<v Speaker 2>modern world continues to live on in the</v>
<v Speaker 2>somewhat different form.</v>

6
00:00:35.230 --> 00:00:39.640
<v Speaker 2>Guillermo del Toro specific written is</v>
<v Speaker 2>one of those manifestations and although</v>

7
00:00:39.641 --> 00:00:42.880
<v Speaker 2>at very consciously embraces the</v>
<v Speaker 2>silliness of the genre,</v>

8
00:00:43.060 --> 00:00:46.810
<v Speaker 2>it nonetheless managers do transcend the</v>
<v Speaker 2>cliche by hinting edits,</v>

9
00:00:46.811 --> 00:00:51.811
<v Speaker 2>very deep symbolic patterns of society</v>
<v Speaker 2>and the individual of how a world or a</v>

10
00:00:52.571 --> 00:00:57.490
<v Speaker 2>center can come both to be destroyed and</v>
<v Speaker 2>reborn on the edge or the rim of the</v>

11
00:00:57.491 --> 00:00:58.324
<v Speaker 2>world.</v>

12
00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:07.680
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

13
00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:10.740
<v Speaker 1>To begin with,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the story gives us a mythological</v>

14
00:01:10.741 --> 00:01:15.260
<v Speaker 1>version of the modern world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Deep in the Pacific Ocean appears a riff</v>

15
00:01:15.261 --> 00:01:20.261
<v Speaker 1>to a dark dimension of giant monsters.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We rubbed out of the water as out of</v>

16
00:01:20.671 --> 00:01:25.671
<v Speaker 1>primordial chaos.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The fact that the rift manifests in the</v>

17
00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:28.980
<v Speaker 1>Pacific Ocean is not arbitrary because</v>
<v Speaker 1>according to how we have mapped in</v>

18
00:01:28.981 --> 00:01:32.160
<v Speaker 1>organize the world,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even though the world is a globe,</v>

19
00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:36.990
<v Speaker 1>it is nonetheless there in the Pacific</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ocean that the rim of the world is</v>

20
00:01:36.991 --> 00:01:41.991
<v Speaker 1>located where East becomes west,</v>
<v Speaker 1>where time jumps from one day to</v>

21
00:01:42.031 --> 00:01:45.690
<v Speaker 1>another.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Her rift in spaced imaged as the gate of</v>

22
00:01:45.691 --> 00:01:48.560
<v Speaker 1>Haiti's out of which chaos and death</v>
<v Speaker 1>erupt,</v>

23
00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:52.820
<v Speaker 1>and so following the analogy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the edge,</v>

24
00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:57.320
<v Speaker 1>the rim of the world in terms of space</v>
<v Speaker 1>is also where appears the possible end</v>

25
00:01:57.321 --> 00:02:01.280
<v Speaker 1>of the world as cataclysmic destruction</v>
<v Speaker 1>of all civilization.</v>

26
00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:08.860
<v Speaker 1>The possibility of the end appears in</v>
<v Speaker 1>the form of the Kaijene we're emerging</v>

27
00:02:09.171 --> 00:02:13.910
<v Speaker 1>out of the water are monsters in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>fullest sense of that word depicted here</v>

28
00:02:13.911 --> 00:02:18.911
<v Speaker 1>as undefinable hybrid creatures mixtures</v>
<v Speaker 1>of humanized forms and diverse animal</v>

29
00:02:20.151 --> 00:02:23.270
<v Speaker 1>characteristics.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They remind us of the universal sea</v>

30
00:02:23.271 --> 00:02:27.740
<v Speaker 1>monster that has appeared all over the</v>
<v Speaker 1>world in the form of the Leviathan,</v>

31
00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:30.740
<v Speaker 1>the Crackin,</v>
<v Speaker 1>trib dis are Cilla.</v>

32
00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:35.510
<v Speaker 1>All of these creatures come together as</v>
<v Speaker 1>a representation of chaos and the</v>

33
00:02:35.511 --> 00:02:39.140
<v Speaker 1>destructive forces of nature.</v>
<v Speaker 1>As rally points out,</v>

34
00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:42.210
<v Speaker 4>there are things you can fight,</v>
<v Speaker 4>acts of God.</v>

35
00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:46.490
<v Speaker 4>You see a hurricane coming,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you have to get out of the way for when</v>

36
00:02:46.491 --> 00:02:50.700
<v Speaker 4>you're in a yeager,</v>
<v Speaker 4>suddenly you can fight the art game.</v>

37
00:02:51.570 --> 00:02:52.403
<v Speaker 4>You can win.</v>

38
00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:55.220
<v Speaker 1>However,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the eruption of chaos,</v>

39
00:02:55.221 --> 00:02:58.880
<v Speaker 1>which happens on the edge is not just</v>
<v Speaker 1>accidental,</v>

40
00:02:59.020 --> 00:03:03.970
<v Speaker 1>but simultaneously appears as an</v>
<v Speaker 1>invasion of a foreign race of aliens</v>

41
00:03:04.210 --> 00:03:08.680
<v Speaker 1>because if what lies outside the wall of</v>
<v Speaker 1>the city is the danger of the natural</v>

42
00:03:08.681 --> 00:03:11.770
<v Speaker 1>world,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it is also the unknown stranger as</v>

43
00:03:11.771 --> 00:03:15.400
<v Speaker 1>possible invader.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so unlike other movie monsters such</v>

44
00:03:15.401 --> 00:03:18.280
<v Speaker 1>as Godzilla who represents rod</v>
<v Speaker 1>destruction,</v>

45
00:03:19.330 --> 00:03:22.030
<v Speaker 1>the Kyde,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you linked several aspects of the rim</v>

46
00:03:22.390 --> 00:03:26.590
<v Speaker 1>and the periphery together linking</v>
<v Speaker 1>closer to cosmic symbolism,</v>

47
00:03:26.710 --> 00:03:29.440
<v Speaker 1>the somewhat humanoid forms of these</v>
<v Speaker 1>monsters.</v>

48
00:03:29.441 --> 00:03:34.210
<v Speaker 1>The fact that they often walk on two</v>
<v Speaker 1>legs also links the more general sea</v>

49
00:03:34.211 --> 00:03:39.211
<v Speaker 1>monster to the image of the clash of</v>
<v Speaker 1>titans or the giants which appear in</v>

50
00:03:40.181 --> 00:03:43.930
<v Speaker 1>almost all cultures as preceding the</v>
<v Speaker 1>civilized world.</v>

51
00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:49.440
<v Speaker 1>Having had to be defeated in a war or</v>
<v Speaker 1>destroyed in a flood in order to make</v>

52
00:03:49.601 --> 00:03:54.601
<v Speaker 1>way for a current age and just like the</v>
<v Speaker 1>ancient ages of giants founding myth,</v>

53
00:03:55.180 --> 00:03:58.390
<v Speaker 1>we're told the dinosaurs were Kaijene as</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

54
00:03:59.020 --> 00:04:03.670
<v Speaker 1>linking the edge of the world where</v>
<v Speaker 1>chaos erupts with an ancient forgotten</v>

55
00:04:03.671 --> 00:04:05.560
<v Speaker 1>time populated by monster</v>

56
00:04:08.600 --> 00:04:11.930
<v Speaker 2>to answer this unending emergence of</v>
<v Speaker 2>chaos from the rim.</v>

57
00:04:12.170 --> 00:04:17.120
<v Speaker 2>Humanity joins hands to bring forth an</v>
<v Speaker 2>army of giant human controlled robots or</v>

58
00:04:17.150 --> 00:04:20.540
<v Speaker 2>yeager's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But what makes it so intuitively right</v>

59
00:04:20.541 --> 00:04:24.140
<v Speaker 2>that Earth's line of defense should come</v>
<v Speaker 2>in the form of a giant man.</v>

60
00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:28.460
<v Speaker 2>The strange satisfaction of the Mecca</v>
<v Speaker 2>robot is that it is a man that the skill</v>

61
00:04:28.461 --> 00:04:33.020
<v Speaker 2>of society at giant weapon to defend the</v>
<v Speaker 2>world and vision as the physical</v>

62
00:04:33.021 --> 00:04:35.900
<v Speaker 2>embodiment of the spirit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which represents a communion.</v>

63
00:04:36.260 --> 00:04:39.760
<v Speaker 2>It's the image of the Saint Michael</v>
<v Speaker 2>figure who brings order food defeating</v>

64
00:04:39.761 --> 00:04:42.950
<v Speaker 2>to gray dragon of chaos by slashing him</v>
<v Speaker 2>with his sword.</v>

65
00:04:43.580 --> 00:04:46.280
<v Speaker 2>It's division of the giant man</v>
<v Speaker 2>representing the community and if the</v>

66
00:04:46.281 --> 00:04:49.970
<v Speaker 2>Commonwealth represented and Thomas</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hobbes own version of the Leviathan.</v>

67
00:04:50.540 --> 00:04:54.260
<v Speaker 2>This premise of the Jaeger as the</v>
<v Speaker 2>embodiment of communion appears.</v>

68
00:04:54.261 --> 00:04:56.630
<v Speaker 2>First of all,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in the name of the yeager leader</v>

69
00:04:56.750 --> 00:05:01.640
<v Speaker 2>Marshall Pentecost for pentecost as to</v>
<v Speaker 2>possibility of finding unity among</v>

70
00:05:01.641 --> 00:05:05.810
<v Speaker 2>diversity when the Holy Spirit made it</v>
<v Speaker 2>possible for people with all languages</v>

71
00:05:05.811 --> 00:05:10.070
<v Speaker 2>to understand each other and so to the</v>
<v Speaker 2>Jaeger program has shown as diverse</v>

72
00:05:10.071 --> 00:05:14.930
<v Speaker 2>peoples and cultures joining together to</v>
<v Speaker 2>fight a common enemy or more succinctly.</v>

73
00:05:14.960 --> 00:05:19.010
<v Speaker 2>The very efficiency of the yeager.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Robots depends on two or more people</v>

74
00:05:19.011 --> 00:05:23.690
<v Speaker 2>coming together into perfect unity,</v>
<v Speaker 2>communing or drifting together with all</v>

75
00:05:23.691 --> 00:05:25.190
<v Speaker 2>their memories,</v>
<v Speaker 2>their faults,</v>

76
00:05:25.191 --> 00:05:29.120
<v Speaker 2>and with all their willpower.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like any society or people who share a</v>

77
00:05:29.121 --> 00:05:32.240
<v Speaker 2>common identity like the two sides of a</v>
<v Speaker 2>brain,</v>

78
00:05:32.450 --> 00:05:35.330
<v Speaker 2>like the opposites which characterize</v>
<v Speaker 2>the human person,</v>

79
00:05:35.660 --> 00:05:38.990
<v Speaker 2>creativity and discipline,</v>
<v Speaker 2>justice and mercy,</v>

80
00:05:39.350 --> 00:05:42.020
<v Speaker 2>freedom and submission to societal</v>
<v Speaker 2>norms.</v>

81
00:05:42.170 --> 00:05:43.900
<v Speaker 3>It's not obvious.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It is Mr [inaudible].</v>

82
00:05:48.060 --> 00:05:50.820
<v Speaker 2>He defensive.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Unity can only be possible when</v>

83
00:05:50.821 --> 00:05:54.210
<v Speaker 2>opposites come together into focus and</v>
<v Speaker 2>common purpose,</v>

84
00:05:54.600 --> 00:05:57.150
<v Speaker 2>but the Jaeger is not only an image of</v>
<v Speaker 2>communion,</v>

85
00:05:57.440 --> 00:06:01.730
<v Speaker 2>but an image of the edge itself,</v>
<v Speaker 2>an extension of technology as the</v>

86
00:06:01.731 --> 00:06:05.930
<v Speaker 2>expansion of human capacity.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Clothing is the most primordial image of</v>

87
00:06:05.931 --> 00:06:09.410
<v Speaker 2>technology.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The most immediate gloving is protection</v>

88
00:06:09.411 --> 00:06:13.730
<v Speaker 2>of weakness and increase in the power to</v>
<v Speaker 2>master to hostilities of the outside,</v>

89
00:06:15.200 --> 00:06:17.840
<v Speaker 2>so like a giant night of cosmic</v>
<v Speaker 2>proportions,</v>

90
00:06:17.870 --> 00:06:20.900
<v Speaker 2>the yeager's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>both an armor and a weapon which can</v>

91
00:06:20.901 --> 00:06:24.860
<v Speaker 2>move into the periphery to meet the</v>
<v Speaker 2>challenge which appears on the edge</v>

92
00:06:29.510 --> 00:06:33.110
<v Speaker 1>in their status and in the expression of</v>
<v Speaker 1>the characters.</v>

93
00:06:33.320 --> 00:06:38.120
<v Speaker 1>The Jager team itself has depicted as</v>
<v Speaker 1>representatives of the margin.</v>

94
00:06:38.750 --> 00:06:42.280
<v Speaker 1>They are the exception.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They are a rag tag group of drift</v>

95
00:06:42.281 --> 00:06:47.281
<v Speaker 1>compatible couples and they are pushed</v>
<v Speaker 1>out of the center and discarded when in</v>

96
00:06:47.901 --> 00:06:52.901
<v Speaker 1>their overconfidence things start to go</v>
<v Speaker 1>downhill and a society now ops to hide</v>

97
00:06:53.571 --> 00:06:56.870
<v Speaker 1>from chaos behind a giant sea wall</v>
<v Speaker 1>instead.</v>

98
00:06:57.500 --> 00:07:02.270
<v Speaker 1>Visually the move towards the edge is</v>
<v Speaker 1>represented as a descent.</v>

99
00:07:02.660 --> 00:07:07.130
<v Speaker 1>This image is repeated over and over.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The head of the Jager with its human</v>

100
00:07:07.131 --> 00:07:12.131
<v Speaker 1>agents descend unto the body than the</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jager is dropped into the waters and</v>

101
00:07:12.470 --> 00:07:17.470
<v Speaker 1>ultimately the jager moves to the bottom</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the ocean floor in order to descend</v>

102
00:07:17.750 --> 00:07:21.140
<v Speaker 1>even into the pit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>into the chaos of the underworld where</v>

103
00:07:21.141 --> 00:07:22.370
<v Speaker 1>the monsters come from</v>

104
00:07:23.800 --> 00:07:27.730
<v Speaker 2>and where to yeager's were at first part</v>
<v Speaker 2>of the military hierarchy of the center.</v>

105
00:07:28.090 --> 00:07:32.200
<v Speaker 2>They now adopt an identity more closely</v>
<v Speaker 2>aligned with the hybrid heroes at the</v>

106
00:07:32.201 --> 00:07:36.970
<v Speaker 2>frontier and they haven't been sort of</v>
<v Speaker 2>the graded into the resistance and I</v>

107
00:07:36.971 --> 00:07:41.971
<v Speaker 2>have them talk in the language of a</v>
<v Speaker 2>western Marshall Ryder outpost,</v>

108
00:07:42.550 --> 00:07:45.100
<v Speaker 2>Jaeger jokey.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You'll see when they moved,</v>

109
00:07:45.101 --> 00:07:48.190
<v Speaker 2>they sound like cowboys instead of</v>
<v Speaker 2>dealing with governments,</v>

110
00:07:48.191 --> 00:07:51.970
<v Speaker 2>they are now forced to do business with</v>
<v Speaker 2>those that dwell in the shadows in</v>

111
00:07:51.971 --> 00:07:54.310
<v Speaker 2>between worlds.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This in between.</v>

112
00:07:54.311 --> 00:07:57.860
<v Speaker 2>This is also noticeable in the</v>
<v Speaker 2>resemblance of the yeager and decayed</v>

113
00:07:57.910 --> 00:08:01.540
<v Speaker 2>you firstly in their name,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which are permutations of each other,</v>

114
00:08:01.870 --> 00:08:06.010
<v Speaker 2>but also in their mirrored appearance as</v>
<v Speaker 2>giant extensions of their societies</v>

115
00:08:06.011 --> 00:08:08.950
<v Speaker 2>engineered by either side to fight</v>
<v Speaker 2>monsters.</v>

116
00:08:09.670 --> 00:08:12.910
<v Speaker 2>We created monsters of our own,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the yeager's,</v>

117
00:08:12.911 --> 00:08:15.850
<v Speaker 2>our emissaries and guardians of order.</v>
<v Speaker 2>On the one hand,</v>

118
00:08:16.300 --> 00:08:18.820
<v Speaker 2>but as giant weapons of nuclear</v>
<v Speaker 2>proportions.</v>

119
00:08:18.820 --> 00:08:21.310
<v Speaker 2>They also like the hive mind control</v>
<v Speaker 2>guide.</v>

120
00:08:21.311 --> 00:08:25.810
<v Speaker 2>You embodied it potential for mass</v>
<v Speaker 2>destruction and here in lies both the</v>

121
00:08:25.811 --> 00:08:30.400
<v Speaker 2>necessity and the danger of the descend</v>
<v Speaker 2>in order to effectively overcome the</v>

122
00:08:30.430 --> 00:08:34.540
<v Speaker 2>unending destruction caused by the riff.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The yeager crews are forced to both</v>

123
00:08:34.541 --> 00:08:37.930
<v Speaker 2>voluntarily and involuntarily be touched</v>
<v Speaker 2>by chaos.</v>

124
00:08:38.290 --> 00:08:42.190
<v Speaker 2>Riley loses his brother and this left</v>
<v Speaker 2>with a print of the cage he was making</v>

125
00:08:42.191 --> 00:08:45.160
<v Speaker 2>on his body,</v>
<v Speaker 2>causing him to resigned to a red or</v>

126
00:08:45.161 --> 00:08:48.190
<v Speaker 2>meaningless life behind the wall.</v>
<v Speaker 2>His partner,</v>

127
00:08:48.191 --> 00:08:49.570
<v Speaker 2>Mako,</v>
<v Speaker 2>on the other hand,</v>

128
00:08:49.571 --> 00:08:52.750
<v Speaker 2>is touched by the chaos of the Chi Jew</v>
<v Speaker 2>and a more mental way,</v>

129
00:08:53.050 --> 00:08:55.740
<v Speaker 2>which takes the form of a severe</v>
<v Speaker 2>childhood trauma,</v>

130
00:08:55.741 --> 00:08:59.820
<v Speaker 2>which has controlled her life in a quest</v>
<v Speaker 2>for vengeance that almost leads or to</v>

131
00:08:59.821 --> 00:09:03.150
<v Speaker 2>point a gun at her own kind.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Decreased scientist.</v>

132
00:09:03.151 --> 00:09:04.380
<v Speaker 2>Newton,</v>
<v Speaker 2>on the other hand,</v>

133
00:09:04.381 --> 00:09:07.500
<v Speaker 2>Holt's an unhealthy desire to be</v>
<v Speaker 2>connected with the guide you,</v>

134
00:09:07.920 --> 00:09:11.370
<v Speaker 2>which consequently leads into learn the</v>
<v Speaker 2>secret of their origin,</v>

135
00:09:11.610 --> 00:09:15.750
<v Speaker 2>but it paradoxically also gives them the</v>
<v Speaker 2>information they need to figure out the</v>

136
00:09:15.751 --> 00:09:19.380
<v Speaker 2>intentions of the Jaegers as well as his</v>
<v Speaker 2>own present location.</v>

137
00:09:19.630 --> 00:09:20.080
<v Speaker 2>It's</v>

138
00:09:20.080 --> 00:09:25.080
<v Speaker 1>fighting chaos on the edge in this</v>
<v Speaker 1>dissent in which we can both obtain the</v>

139
00:09:25.511 --> 00:09:28.120
<v Speaker 1>power and the knowledge to emerge</v>
<v Speaker 1>victorious,</v>

140
00:09:28.570 --> 00:09:33.550
<v Speaker 1>but in which there's also the danger of</v>
<v Speaker 1>becoming consumed by it perishing or</v>

141
00:09:33.551 --> 00:09:37.840
<v Speaker 1>even reemerging as the very same thing</v>
<v Speaker 1>we had wanted to overcome.</v>

142
00:09:38.890 --> 00:09:39.723
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>

143
00:09:40.330 --> 00:09:43.490
<v Speaker 2>In the end,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the men and women of the Jaeger program</v>

144
00:09:43.491 --> 00:09:48.410
<v Speaker 2>have to consciously find a balance on</v>
<v Speaker 2>this slippery slope in between order and</v>

145
00:09:48.411 --> 00:09:50.990
<v Speaker 2>chaos,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it's not only in the balance that's</v>

146
00:09:50.991 --> 00:09:54.230
<v Speaker 2>found in this relationship or this</v>
<v Speaker 2>harmony of opposites,</v>

147
00:09:54.350 --> 00:09:58.250
<v Speaker 2>but it's the individual as the place</v>
<v Speaker 2>where unity and resolution finder most</v>

148
00:09:58.251 --> 00:10:01.580
<v Speaker 2>immediate form.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All of these characters have to reassess</v>

149
00:10:01.581 --> 00:10:05.480
<v Speaker 2>their opinions and their compulsions in</v>
<v Speaker 2>order to to get our take up the sword.</v>

150
00:10:05.481 --> 00:10:10.481
<v Speaker 2>One last time</v>
<v Speaker 2>in this final clash,</v>

151
00:10:13.161 --> 00:10:15.410
<v Speaker 2>they learned that it is not only an</v>
<v Speaker 2>opposition,</v>

152
00:10:15.411 --> 00:10:19.220
<v Speaker 2>that the guide you are to be defeated.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's by merging with them in a strange</v>

153
00:10:19.221 --> 00:10:23.330
<v Speaker 2>manner that unlocks the gate for a</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeager to make it's final descend into</v>

154
00:10:23.331 --> 00:10:26.060
<v Speaker 2>the underworld.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This descend into the underworld can be</v>

155
00:10:26.061 --> 00:10:31.061
<v Speaker 2>seen as the embracing of chaos without</v>
<v Speaker 2>being defeated by Riley writing to guide</v>

156
00:10:31.311 --> 00:10:32.400
<v Speaker 2>you in to the rift.</v>

157
00:10:32.400 --> 00:10:35.510
<v Speaker 2>This like Gandalf riding the Balrog</v>
<v Speaker 2>through the Ebis,</v>

158
00:10:35.720 --> 00:10:39.860
<v Speaker 2>and ultimately it is an image of Christ,</v>
<v Speaker 2>descendants who Haiti's and ultimate</v>

159
00:10:39.861 --> 00:10:43.100
<v Speaker 2>resurrection,</v>
<v Speaker 2>his trampling down death by death.</v>

160
00:10:43.310 --> 00:10:46.490
<v Speaker 2>It's this voluntary acceptance of the</v>
<v Speaker 2>existence of chaos,</v>

161
00:10:46.491 --> 00:10:50.000
<v Speaker 2>both without and within and coming</v>
<v Speaker 2>together in communion.</v>

162
00:10:50.001 --> 00:10:52.790
<v Speaker 2>Despite that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that the last act of courage and</v>

163
00:10:52.791 --> 00:10:57.560
<v Speaker 2>sacrifice culminates into a single act</v>
<v Speaker 2>of the human person in a moment of</v>

164
00:10:57.561 --> 00:11:01.160
<v Speaker 2>solitude,</v>
<v Speaker 2>destroying the power of the underworld</v>

165
00:11:01.161 --> 00:11:05.780
<v Speaker 2>and finally closing to rift the return</v>
<v Speaker 2>to the surface as dare for shown as a</v>

166
00:11:05.781 --> 00:11:08.600
<v Speaker 2>rebirth,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as the emergence of a new world free</v>

167
00:11:08.601 --> 00:11:12.590
<v Speaker 2>from the madness of destruction,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but also the rebirth into a world where</v>

168
00:11:12.591 --> 00:11:17.591
<v Speaker 2>the two opposites of Riley and Mako find</v>
<v Speaker 2>themselves united floating on an island</v>

169
00:11:17.601 --> 00:11:20.960
<v Speaker 2>in the vast ocean.</v>
<v Speaker 2>As the final image of a new beginning.</v>
