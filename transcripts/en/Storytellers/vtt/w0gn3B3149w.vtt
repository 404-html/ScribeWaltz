1
00:00:10.010 --> 00:00:10.843
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2
00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:25.140
<v Speaker 2>As someone who was born two years after</v>
<v Speaker 2>the official collapse of the Soviet</v>

3
00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:27.060
<v Speaker 2>Union,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it is hard to imagine the constant</v>

4
00:00:27.061 --> 00:00:32.061
<v Speaker 2>possibility of global nuclear war and</v>
<v Speaker 2>the which the world lift for so long.</v>

5
00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:35.200
<v Speaker 3>Do I have to know what happens when an</v>
<v Speaker 3>atomic bomb explode?</v>

6
00:00:35.980 --> 00:00:38.800
<v Speaker 3>You all know when it come,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we hope it never comes,</v>

7
00:00:38.801 --> 00:00:39.910
<v Speaker 3>but they to get ready.</v>

8
00:00:40.030 --> 00:00:45.030
<v Speaker 2>There seems to be a substantial mount</v>
<v Speaker 2>off existential worry right now in 2017</v>

9
00:00:46.151 --> 00:00:49.090
<v Speaker 2>births.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wonder if it can compare to the way in</v>

10
00:00:49.091 --> 00:00:54.040
<v Speaker 2>which the world must have been honing in</v>
<v Speaker 2>spreads in 90 62 when doing the Cuba</v>

11
00:00:54.041 --> 00:00:57.550
<v Speaker 2>crisis.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Nuclear War seems births a moments away.</v>

12
00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:03.020
<v Speaker 3>It arrogantly recommend that the United</v>
<v Speaker 3>States and the Soviet Union pump,</v>

13
00:01:05.910 --> 00:01:10.910
<v Speaker 3>we'll remove the existing threat to the</v>
<v Speaker 3>security of the western hemisphere and</v>

14
00:01:11.431 --> 00:01:12.300
<v Speaker 3>the peace of the world.</v>

15
00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:17.670
<v Speaker 2>Isn't it therefore strange that when</v>
<v Speaker 2>Stanley Kubrick's 90 64 movie doctor</v>

16
00:01:17.671 --> 00:01:21.510
<v Speaker 2>strange love opens with a nuclear bomb</v>
<v Speaker 2>of being refused,</v>

17
00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:26.540
<v Speaker 2>it is this romantic song we are hearing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It becomes clear that Kubrick has chosen</v>

18
00:01:26.851 --> 00:01:30.210
<v Speaker 2>to turn the biggest threat to the world</v>
<v Speaker 2>into satire.</v>

19
00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:35.600
<v Speaker 2>Existential dread is a great source for</v>
<v Speaker 2>satirical comedy and doing the 60s to</v>

20
00:01:36.151 --> 00:01:39.330
<v Speaker 2>nuclear tensions were also satirized but</v>
<v Speaker 2>others,</v>

21
00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:43.290
<v Speaker 2>Tom Lehrer,</v>
<v Speaker 2>both Harvard educated mathematician and</v>

22
00:01:43.291 --> 00:01:45.330
<v Speaker 2>satirical songwriter roads.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This,</v>

23
00:01:45.331 --> 00:01:46.230
<v Speaker 2>for example,</v>

24
00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:51.290
<v Speaker 4>more of the bomb that drops on.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You get your friends and neighbor,</v>

25
00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:59.880
<v Speaker 4>they'll be nobody left behind to debris</v>
<v Speaker 4>and we all go together when we</v>

26
00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:09.260
<v Speaker 4>come back to that is to know you never</v>
<v Speaker 4>sold bereavement and inspiring</v>

27
00:02:11.371 --> 00:02:12.450
<v Speaker 4>achievement.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yes,</v>

28
00:02:12.451 --> 00:02:15.330
<v Speaker 4>we all will go together when we go.</v>

29
00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:19.050
<v Speaker 2>However,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think no one's satirize the cult word</v>

30
00:02:19.051 --> 00:02:22.330
<v Speaker 2>better than Stelly Kubrick with doctor</v>
<v Speaker 2>strange love.</v>

31
00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:27.900
<v Speaker 2>It sends audiences books into laughter</v>
<v Speaker 2>and also serious worry about why anyone</v>

32
00:02:28.601 --> 00:02:33.010
<v Speaker 2>could even love about worlds possibly</v>
<v Speaker 2>ending in a nuclear holocaust.</v>

33
00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:36.730
<v Speaker 2>In this video,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I want to explore both the symbolism and</v>

34
00:02:36.731 --> 00:02:41.500
<v Speaker 2>set of the film birth connected also to</v>
<v Speaker 2>the politics of den and the politics of</v>

35
00:02:41.501 --> 00:02:46.501
<v Speaker 2>today by choosing this romantic song,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Kubrick tunes refueling the bombers in a</v>

36
00:02:46.721 --> 00:02:49.990
<v Speaker 2>sexual act.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Dr Strange Laugh is a movie dead</v>

37
00:02:50.020 --> 00:02:55.020
<v Speaker 2>ridicules the Cold War and nuclear arms</v>
<v Speaker 2>race by turning it into an allegory for</v>

38
00:02:55.211 --> 00:02:59.040
<v Speaker 2>sex.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Johnathan swift describes one of Kuric</v>

39
00:02:59.050 --> 00:03:03.700
<v Speaker 2>central teams in multiple of his movies</v>
<v Speaker 2>instead of the damned animal man.</v>

40
00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:07.840
<v Speaker 2>Kubrick's characters are inherently</v>
<v Speaker 2>sexual and aggressive,</v>

41
00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:11.200
<v Speaker 2>is weapons extensions of a sexual</v>
<v Speaker 2>organs.</v>

42
00:03:11.710 --> 00:03:16.000
<v Speaker 2>He escapable off creating sophisticated</v>
<v Speaker 2>and complicated systems,</v>

43
00:03:16.001 --> 00:03:19.810
<v Speaker 2>birth incapable of using them</v>
<v Speaker 2>responsibly and Morley.</v>

44
00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:25.703
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

45
00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:41.070
<v Speaker 2>Dr. Strange Loft presents in the film,</v>
<v Speaker 2>two kinds of men,</v>

46
00:03:41.130 --> 00:03:46.130
<v Speaker 2>first of which is the military type.</v>
<v Speaker 2>These men cannot wait to drop a nuclear</v>

47
00:03:46.201 --> 00:03:49.500
<v Speaker 2>bomb or Russia,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the main characters that embody this.</v>

48
00:03:49.501 --> 00:03:54.210
<v Speaker 2>Our Channel Jack the ripper who sets the</v>
<v Speaker 2>whole plan to bomb Russia into motion</v>

49
00:03:54.270 --> 00:03:58.230
<v Speaker 2>and general buck to Richardson,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Two d military men.</v>

50
00:03:58.260 --> 00:04:02.820
<v Speaker 2>The Cold War is incredibly frustrating.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The movie ella crisis,</v>

51
00:04:02.821 --> 00:04:07.140
<v Speaker 2>this frustration from a lack of military</v>
<v Speaker 2>action into sexual frustration.</v>

52
00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:11.340
<v Speaker 2>Jack the ripper refuels the reason for</v>
<v Speaker 2>ordering the nuclear bomb,</v>

53
00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:17.120
<v Speaker 5>I can no longer sit back and allow</v>
<v Speaker 5>communist infiltration.</v>

54
00:04:18.080 --> 00:04:19.520
<v Speaker 5>Communist indoctrination.</v>

55
00:04:20.540 --> 00:04:20.980
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

56
00:04:20.980 --> 00:04:22.270
<v Speaker 5>Communist subversion.</v>

57
00:04:23.740 --> 00:04:24.230
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

58
00:04:24.230 --> 00:04:26.630
<v Speaker 5>and the international communist</v>
<v Speaker 5>conspiracy.</v>

59
00:04:27.690 --> 00:04:28.070
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

60
00:04:28.070 --> 00:04:33.070
<v Speaker 5>The sapien and purify all of our</v>
<v Speaker 5>impressionists bodily fluids.</v>

61
00:04:34.460 --> 00:04:34.950
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

62
00:04:34.950 --> 00:04:39.120
<v Speaker 2>And then later refuels he discovered</v>
<v Speaker 2>this infiltration when trying to have</v>

63
00:04:39.121 --> 00:04:39.954
<v Speaker 2>sex.</v>

64
00:04:40.060 --> 00:04:44.570
<v Speaker 1>Well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I first became aware of it and then</v>

65
00:04:44.580 --> 00:04:49.580
<v Speaker 1>drink during the physical act of love</v>
<v Speaker 1>as a,</v>

66
00:04:50.230 --> 00:04:51.930
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a profound sense of</v>

67
00:04:54.160 --> 00:04:55.350
<v Speaker 1>feeling of emptiness motto.</v>

68
00:04:56.130 --> 00:05:00.960
<v Speaker 2>The Cold War has taken away a sexual</v>
<v Speaker 2>virility and the only solution he sees</v>

69
00:05:00.990 --> 00:05:03.750
<v Speaker 2>is dropping a load into modern Russia as</v>
<v Speaker 2>it were.</v>

70
00:05:04.020 --> 00:05:06.880
<v Speaker 2>The same goes for general bucks.</v>
<v Speaker 2>30 Hudson.</v>

71
00:05:06.960 --> 00:05:10.740
<v Speaker 2>He leaves his rather bimbo which</v>
<v Speaker 2>girlfriend right before having sex with</v>

72
00:05:10.741 --> 00:05:14.810
<v Speaker 2>her to go through the ballroom.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He even says that his girl can already</v>

73
00:05:14.820 --> 00:05:18.300
<v Speaker 2>start the countdown,</v>
<v Speaker 2>clear referral to the countdown off</v>

74
00:05:18.301 --> 00:05:19.830
<v Speaker 2>launching nuclear strikes.</v>

75
00:05:20.340 --> 00:05:23.760
<v Speaker 6>You just start your comp down and old</v>
<v Speaker 6>bucky,</v>

76
00:05:23.761 --> 00:05:27.300

<v Speaker 2>You stand.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Of course sexually frustrated and can't</v>

78
00:05:30.961 --> 00:05:32.130
<v Speaker 2>wait to bomb Russia</v>

79
00:05:32.560 --> 00:05:37.540
<v Speaker 6>indicate that we would strive 90% of</v>
<v Speaker 6>their nuclear capabilities.</v>

80
00:05:37.541 --> 00:05:42.541
<v Speaker 6>We went there for prevail and suffer</v>
<v Speaker 6>only modest and acceptable civilian</v>

81
00:05:42.641 --> 00:05:46.110
<v Speaker 6>casualties from the remaining forest,</v>
<v Speaker 6>which would be badly damaged and I'm</v>

82
00:05:46.120 --> 00:05:46.953
<v Speaker 6>uncoordinated</v>

83
00:05:47.060 --> 00:05:49.040
<v Speaker 2>when the precedent for futures to do</v>
<v Speaker 2>this.</v>

84
00:05:49.041 --> 00:05:52.700
<v Speaker 2>He starts chewing gum like a smoker,</v>
<v Speaker 2>chewing gum to not smoke.</v>

85
00:05:52.701 --> 00:05:56.210
<v Speaker 2>He is chewing gum to distract him from</v>
<v Speaker 2>his sexual frustration.</v>

86
00:05:56.780 --> 00:06:01.700
<v Speaker 2>Now movie is filled with Phallic symbols</v>
<v Speaker 2>such as the aforementioned refueling of</v>

87
00:06:01.701 --> 00:06:05.420
<v Speaker 2>the bombers,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the Cigar General Jack The ripper smokes</v>

88
00:06:05.510 --> 00:06:09.130
<v Speaker 2>the lung machine on the uses.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And at the end of the movie aircrewman</v>

89
00:06:09.140 --> 00:06:13.250
<v Speaker 2>the Kong who symbolizes the biggest</v>
<v Speaker 2>direction note to men when he quote</v>

90
00:06:13.251 --> 00:06:15.860
<v Speaker 2>unquote writes the bomb.</v>
<v Speaker 2>As Joan says,</v>

91
00:06:15.861 --> 00:06:20.120
<v Speaker 2>swift said these are extensions of the</v>
<v Speaker 2>mill sexual organs.</v>

92
00:06:20.330 --> 00:06:24.320
<v Speaker 2>The other kind of men in the film is the</v>
<v Speaker 2>one that doesn't want to drop the bomb.</v>

93
00:06:24.440 --> 00:06:29.440
<v Speaker 2>He is a fiscally week sexually impotent</v>
<v Speaker 2>men plays by the same Ectera Dsr English</v>

94
00:06:29.871 --> 00:06:33.760
<v Speaker 2>captain Lionel Mandrake,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the precedent Merkin muffly and doctor</v>

95
00:06:33.761 --> 00:06:37.580
<v Speaker 2>strange love himself.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The English Captain Mandrake who tries</v>

96
00:06:37.581 --> 00:06:42.110
<v Speaker 2>to stop General Jack The ripper is</v>
<v Speaker 2>fiscally impaired and enabled to use the</v>

97
00:06:42.111 --> 00:06:45.330
<v Speaker 2>rather phallic machinegun referring to a</v>
<v Speaker 2>sexual impotence.</v>

98
00:06:45.331 --> 00:06:46.164
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

99
00:06:47.110 --> 00:06:51.400
<v Speaker 3>I uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I haven't had any much experience,</v>

100
00:06:51.401 --> 00:06:54.190
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>with those machines.</v>

101
00:06:54.390 --> 00:06:55.223
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Got It.</v>

102
00:06:55.680 --> 00:06:58.210
<v Speaker 3>Any of a professed a bathroom in my</v>
<v Speaker 3>sales pitch.</v>

103
00:06:58.220 --> 00:07:01.030
<v Speaker 3>Heinrich in the name of the magazine in</v>
<v Speaker 3>the continental congress come in and</v>

104
00:07:01.031 --> 00:07:01.950
<v Speaker 3>treatment.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's a boy.</v>

105
00:07:02.380 --> 00:07:05.630
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'd love to come back time.</v>

106
00:07:06.070 --> 00:07:09.100
<v Speaker 3>What's happened.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You'll see the string and my legs gone.</v>

107
00:07:11.030 --> 00:07:12.360
<v Speaker 3>One,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Craig,</v>

<v Speaker 3>Gammy leg.</v>

109
00:07:16.810 --> 00:07:17.643
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

110
00:07:17.780 --> 00:07:22.780
<v Speaker 2>The precedent who dismisses all of the</v>
<v Speaker 2>military passion is rather wimpy and</v>

111
00:07:22.881 --> 00:07:25.610
<v Speaker 2>weak looking when he calls the Russian</v>
<v Speaker 2>precedent.</v>

112
00:07:25.611 --> 00:07:29.990
<v Speaker 2>It sounds like an all sexist marriage</v>
<v Speaker 2>where the emasculated precedent tries,</v>

113
00:07:29.991 --> 00:07:33.470
<v Speaker 2>but Phil's to control his annoying</v>
<v Speaker 2>complaining wife.</v>

<v Speaker 5>Can you imagine how I feel about it?</v>

116

<v Speaker 5>Dimitri,</v>
<v Speaker 5>why do you think I'm calling you just to</v>

<v Speaker 5>say hello?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Of course I like to speak to you.</v>

118
00:07:48.910 --> 00:07:50.560
<v Speaker 5>Of course.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I like to say hello.</v>

119
00:07:51.520 --> 00:07:53.170
<v Speaker 5>Not now,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but anytime.</v>

120

<v Speaker 2>doctor strange love,</v>

124
00:08:04.800 --> 00:08:09.330

125
00:08:09.331 --> 00:08:13.020
<v Speaker 2>the Nazis.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He represents the Nazi scientist that</v>

126
00:08:13.021 --> 00:08:17.250
<v Speaker 2>started working in the u s after World</v>

<v Speaker 4>gather round while I sing you a banner.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Fun Brown.</v>

129
00:08:24.730 --> 00:08:29.730
<v Speaker 4>A man who's that lead jams Isru the by</v>
<v Speaker 4>expedia bought him a Nazi.</v>

130

<v Speaker 4>He won't even fry Nazi schmaltzy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Sas Van are fine.</v>

131
00:08:39.310 --> 00:08:42.120
<v Speaker 2>Doctor Strange love symbolizes</v>
<v Speaker 2>paralyzed.</v>

132
00:08:42.260 --> 00:08:46.570
<v Speaker 2>It's not destroyed Nazi ideology.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When it becomes clear that the bomb will</v>

133
00:08:46.571 --> 00:08:49.750
<v Speaker 2>be dropped.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He suggests a Bronco with many women</v>

134
00:08:49.751 --> 00:08:53.530
<v Speaker 2>chosen for their sexual attributes to</v>
<v Speaker 2>repopulate the earth.</v>

135
00:08:53.710 --> 00:08:57.360
<v Speaker 2>A suggestion that the Mescaleros</v>
<v Speaker 2>precedent likes,</v>

136
00:08:57.560 --> 00:09:02.560
<v Speaker 7>you mentioned the ratio of 10 women to</v>
<v Speaker 7>each man.</v>

137
00:09:03.380 --> 00:09:07.940
<v Speaker 7>Wouldn't that necessitate the</v>
<v Speaker 7>abandonment of the so called a</v>

138
00:09:07.970 --> 00:09:10.550
<v Speaker 7>monogamous sexual relationship?</v>
<v Speaker 7>I mean,</v>

139
00:09:10.790 --> 00:09:12.350
<v Speaker 7>as far as men were concerned,</v>

140
00:09:14.060 --> 00:09:15.740
<v Speaker 8>yes,</v>

<v Speaker 8>a sacrifice is required for the future</v>

142
00:09:18.411 --> 00:09:23.030
<v Speaker 8>of the human race.</v>
<v Speaker 8>I hasten to add that since each man the</v>

143
00:09:23.050 --> 00:09:25.430
<v Speaker 8>it will be required to do,</v>
<v Speaker 8>but to just</v>

144
00:09:27.410 --> 00:09:32.060
<v Speaker 8>service along these lines there women</v>
<v Speaker 8>will have to be selected for this sexual</v>

145
00:09:32.450 --> 00:09:34.850
<v Speaker 8>characteristics,</v>
<v Speaker 8>which you have to be of a highly</v>

146
00:09:35.270 --> 00:09:36.590
<v Speaker 8>stimulating nature.</v>

148
00:09:40.181 --> 00:09:42.850
<v Speaker 2>nuclear missile gap after they leave the</v>
<v Speaker 2>bunkers.</v>

149

<v Speaker 2>pure breeding inside the bunker while he</v>

<v Speaker 2>shouts out,</v>

152

<v Speaker 9>right.</v>

153
00:09:57.410 --> 00:09:59.900
<v Speaker 2>Ending the movie with the nuclear</v>
<v Speaker 2>Holocaust.</v>

154
00:09:59.930 --> 00:10:02.630
<v Speaker 2>While we hear a song about two lovers</v>
<v Speaker 2>death,</v>

155
00:10:02.631 --> 00:10:03.660

<v Speaker 2>in and satirize perfectly.</v>

160
00:10:28.331 --> 00:10:31.720
<v Speaker 2>The political situation of it's time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>On the one hand,</v>

161
00:10:31.750 --> 00:10:35.950
<v Speaker 2>it's ridicules Republicans search as</v>
<v Speaker 2>young Reagan and the presidential</v>

162
00:10:35.951 --> 00:10:38.590
<v Speaker 2>candidates.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Very cool toddler who is aggressive</v>

163
00:10:38.591 --> 00:10:43.330
<v Speaker 2>anticommunist pro nuclear expansion.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're Toyak was criticized strongly by</v>

164
00:10:43.331 --> 00:10:46.300
<v Speaker 2>Democrats who saw him this dangerous</v>
<v Speaker 2>warmongering.</v>

165
00:10:46.540 --> 00:10:51.430
<v Speaker 9>See it sounds like it's a side job.</v>
<v Speaker 9>I'm big claim like a 52 jet exhaust,</v>

166

<v Speaker 9>fry them tickets to the bar.</v>
<v Speaker 9>He got a chance</v>

167
00:10:59.860 --> 00:11:01.360
<v Speaker 2>in the week.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You miss escalators.</v>

168
00:11:01.370 --> 00:11:05.330
<v Speaker 2>Characters in doctor strange love.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We see the so called wimpy EC has</v>

169
00:11:05.331 --> 00:11:09.490
<v Speaker 2>Democrats search as Adelaide Stevenson.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was called [inaudible] Bay.</v>

170
00:11:09.500 --> 00:11:14.500
<v Speaker 2>Richard Nixon in 1952 the term refers to</v>
<v Speaker 2>intellectuals that are too out of touch</v>

171
00:11:14.901 --> 00:11:16.880
<v Speaker 2>with reality,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the common people,</v>

172
00:11:16.910 --> 00:11:18.920
<v Speaker 2>sexual interests,</v>
<v Speaker 2>et cetera.</v>

173
00:11:19.070 --> 00:11:22.760
<v Speaker 2>In today's politics.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it's no surprise why so many.</v>

174
00:11:22.761 --> 00:11:27.710
<v Speaker 2>We're worried about trump having access</v>
<v Speaker 2>to the nuclear codes with his sexual</v>

175
00:11:27.711 --> 00:11:30.260
<v Speaker 2>remarks and x from the guts,</v>
<v Speaker 2>aggressive,</v>

176
00:11:30.261 --> 00:11:31.610
<v Speaker 2>reactionary.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're toric.</v>

177
00:11:31.611 --> 00:11:34.070
<v Speaker 2>We seen him clearly,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Kubrick stamps,</v>

178
00:11:34.071 --> 00:11:35.790
<v Speaker 2>animal men,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the passionate,</v>

179
00:11:35.820 --> 00:11:39.440
<v Speaker 2>sexually aggressive military characters</v>
<v Speaker 2>in doctor strange love.</v>

180
00:11:40.310 --> 00:11:44.750
<v Speaker 2>That is why many solid him,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a serious threat to nuclear stability.</v>

181
00:11:44.840 --> 00:11:49.310
<v Speaker 2>Even though trump supporters pointed out</v>
<v Speaker 2>that when looking at actual policy,</v>

182
00:11:49.340 --> 00:11:54.340
<v Speaker 2>Clinton Syrian policy would be much</v>
<v Speaker 2>worse for us relations and nuclear</v>

183
00:11:54.911 --> 00:11:59.911
<v Speaker 2>stability or so people thought.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's very clear that Dr strange loves</v>

184
00:12:00.421 --> 00:12:05.290
<v Speaker 2>still holds up today in the movie,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the sexual tension was released sending</v>

185
00:12:05.291 --> 00:12:09.280
<v Speaker 2>the world into nuclear holocaust.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Luckily in reality,</v>

186
00:12:09.281 --> 00:12:12.580
<v Speaker 2>this never happens,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the cold war and doesn't seem to</v>

187
00:12:12.581 --> 00:12:15.040
<v Speaker 2>have ended after the fall of the Soviet</v>
<v Speaker 2>Union.</v>

188
00:12:15.041 --> 00:12:18.040
<v Speaker 2>He bird has been simmering on below the</v>
<v Speaker 2>surface.</v>

189
00:12:18.280 --> 00:12:21.010
<v Speaker 2>We hope it's willing to come to an</v>
<v Speaker 2>eruption birth.</v>

190
00:12:21.011 --> 00:12:26.011
<v Speaker 2>It's still good time to rewatch Dr.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Strange laugh to become aware again and</v>

191
00:12:26.051 --> 00:12:30.640
<v Speaker 2>also have a good laugh about the</v>
<v Speaker 2>possibility of nuclear annihilation.</v>

192
00:12:31.290 --> 00:12:33.080
<v Speaker 2>I wish we had one of them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Don't stay machine</v>

193
00:12:34.780 --> 00:12:39.280
<v Speaker 2>because s Tom Lehrer sings,</v>
<v Speaker 2>at least we will all go together when we</v>

194
00:12:39.281 --> 00:12:40.114

198
00:12:58.461 --> 00:13:02.840
<v Speaker 4>go together.</v>
<v Speaker 4>When we go all suffused with an</v>

199
00:13:02.841 --> 00:13:07.841
<v Speaker 4>incandescent glow,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no one will have the endurance to</v>

200
00:13:07.941 --> 00:13:12.050
<v Speaker 4>collect on his insurance.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Lloyd's of London will be loaded when</v>

201

<v Speaker 4>world is.</v>
