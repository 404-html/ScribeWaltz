1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.290
<v Speaker 1>Alright,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so before we begin,</v>

2
00:00:01.291 --> 00:00:04.800
<v Speaker 1>I want to say to the video that you're</v>
<v Speaker 1>about to watch is one of our additional</v>

3
00:00:04.801 --> 00:00:06.400
<v Speaker 1>commentary videos,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

4
00:00:06.430 --> 00:00:08.640
<v Speaker 1>they're very low key on the editing</v>
<v Speaker 1>side,</v>

5
00:00:08.641 --> 00:00:12.630
<v Speaker 1>so don't expect anything too fancy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And they were basically just meant to</v>

6
00:00:12.631 --> 00:00:17.631
<v Speaker 1>add some things or respond to comments</v>
<v Speaker 1>about the original video essay in the</v>

7
00:00:17.941 --> 00:00:20.430
<v Speaker 1>past.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We made these for our patrons only,</v>

8
00:00:20.431 --> 00:00:23.100
<v Speaker 1>but from now on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these additional commentary that will be</v>

9
00:00:23.101 --> 00:00:26.550
<v Speaker 1>posted on our second channel,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is called the storytellers</v>

10
00:00:26.551 --> 00:00:29.010
<v Speaker 1>podcasts.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The link for that is in the description.</v>

11
00:00:30.010 --> 00:00:33.810
<v Speaker 1>This is because we're working on a</v>
<v Speaker 1>complete patron and channel makeover,</v>

12
00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:37.200
<v Speaker 1>which we're really excited about.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're working together with a graphic</v>

13
00:00:37.201 --> 00:00:41.970
<v Speaker 1>designer to help us build a or make a</v>
<v Speaker 1>better banner,</v>

14
00:00:41.971 --> 00:00:42.900
<v Speaker 1>more professional,</v>
<v Speaker 1>better,</v>

15
00:00:42.901 --> 00:00:44.470
<v Speaker 1>and it's looking really good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I,</v>

16
00:00:44.471 --> 00:00:47.720
<v Speaker 1>I hope it will be up in a couple of</v>
<v Speaker 1>weeks probably.</v>

17
00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:48.720
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and yeah,</v>

18
00:00:48.721 --> 00:00:50.030
<v Speaker 1>we're really excited about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

19
00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:52.410
<v Speaker 1>so our patrons will still get a better</v>
<v Speaker 1>deal of course.</v>

20
00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:54.140
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so from where in front of that checkout,</v>

21
00:00:54.150 --> 00:00:56.280
<v Speaker 1>my comment on this video,</v>
<v Speaker 1>also,</v>

22
00:00:56.281 --> 00:00:57.900
<v Speaker 1>one last note,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've been seeing a number of people</v>

23
00:00:57.901 --> 00:01:02.580
<v Speaker 1>getting offended by my criticism of high</v>
<v Speaker 1>profile liberal audiences mostly,</v>

24
00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:04.920
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>although I do not explicitly mentioned</v>

25
00:01:04.921 --> 00:01:09.921
<v Speaker 1>that I'm as much criticizing dose people</v>
<v Speaker 1>as I am the neoconservatives who saw it</v>

26
00:01:10.261 --> 00:01:13.440
<v Speaker 1>as praising the Iraq war.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm just trying to provide a,</v>

27
00:01:13.510 --> 00:01:16.290
<v Speaker 1>a new way of looking at the film.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't have to agree with me.</v>

28
00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:19.020
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was just trying to show a structural</v>

29
00:01:19.021 --> 00:01:21.150
<v Speaker 1>message of the film in an objective</v>
<v Speaker 1>manner,</v>

30
00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:24.440
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or at least as objective as possible.</v>

31
00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:26.240
<v Speaker 1>Anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 1>enjoy guys.</v>

32
00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:28.040
<v Speaker 1>Alright.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hello everyone.</v>

33
00:01:28.041 --> 00:01:29.830
<v Speaker 1>So three days ago,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

34
00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:34.190
<v Speaker 1>I uploaded my American sniper video and</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the meantime we've got a lot of</v>

35
00:01:34.191 --> 00:01:37.160
<v Speaker 1>comments,</v>
<v Speaker 1>questions and criticisms and now I</v>

36
00:01:37.161 --> 00:01:41.510
<v Speaker 1>wanted to make this video to answer and</v>
<v Speaker 1>talk about some of the top comments that</v>

37
00:01:41.511 --> 00:01:45.260
<v Speaker 1>we got and that touch on some important</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the most talked about points.</v>

38
00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:47.480
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but before I get into any of that,</v>

39
00:01:47.481 --> 00:01:50.810
<v Speaker 1>I want to promote the thesis that I use</v>
<v Speaker 1>for this analysis.</v>

40
00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:54.290
<v Speaker 1>And now just just that I use is called</v>
<v Speaker 1>terministic screens and partisan</v>

41
00:01:54.291 --> 00:01:57.670
<v Speaker 1>audiences,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a birkin cluster analysis of Clint</v>

42
00:01:57.670 --> 00:02:00.140
<v Speaker 1>Eastwood's American sniper by Daniel K</v>
<v Speaker 1>dot Mervin.</v>

43
00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:04.400
<v Speaker 1>Now he uses the same cluster analysis</v>
<v Speaker 1>method of the sickening to film,</v>

44
00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:08.600
<v Speaker 1>but takes it a step further by combining</v>
<v Speaker 1>it with liberal and conservative</v>

45
00:02:08.870 --> 00:02:13.100
<v Speaker 1>terministic screens or in other words,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the weight at both of those groups look</v>

46
00:02:13.101 --> 00:02:15.800
<v Speaker 1>at the world and which terms they</v>
<v Speaker 1>resonate with.</v>

47
00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:18.710
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and he uses both of these things to</v>

48
00:02:18.711 --> 00:02:22.280
<v Speaker 1>examine how either of the parties</v>
<v Speaker 1>interpreted the film food our own</v>

49
00:02:22.281 --> 00:02:24.950
<v Speaker 1>political screen or misinterpreted,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you will.</v>

50
00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:28.010
<v Speaker 1>You can pause it here if you want to</v>
<v Speaker 1>read it a little bit.</v>

51
00:02:28.011 --> 00:02:28.570
<v Speaker 1>But yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

52
00:02:28.570 --> 00:02:32.360
<v Speaker 1>it's a fairly thought provoking fingers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a lot of truth in it.</v>

53
00:02:32.770 --> 00:02:34.640
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's available for free online.</v>

54
00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:36.290
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll try to add a link in the</v>

55
00:02:36.291 --> 00:02:39.280
<v Speaker 1>description in the description so you</v>
<v Speaker 1>can check it out if you're interested.</v>

56
00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:40.131
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

57
00:02:40.131 --> 00:02:42.770
<v Speaker 1>So yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mainly use a cluster analysis method</v>

58
00:02:42.771 --> 00:02:46.940
<v Speaker 1>combined with some of his own findings</v>
<v Speaker 1>for my own video,</v>

59
00:02:47.350 --> 00:02:50.060
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as it's a great tool to discern the main</v>

60
00:02:50.061 --> 00:02:52.670
<v Speaker 1>themes of a film,</v>
<v Speaker 1>texts objectively,</v>

61
00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:56.620
<v Speaker 1>and to see how to subordinate terms</v>
<v Speaker 1>change value throughout.</v>

62
00:02:57.290 --> 00:02:58.940
<v Speaker 1>All right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so without further ado,</v>

63
00:02:58.960 --> 00:03:02.710
<v Speaker 1>let's go onto some of the comments.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the first one is by Ellis.</v>

64
00:03:02.711 --> 00:03:03.544
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

65
00:03:03.550 --> 00:03:04.271
<v Speaker 1>interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Take on.</v>

66
00:03:04.271 --> 00:03:06.190
<v Speaker 1>The film didn't realize it got so much</v>
<v Speaker 1>hate.</v>

67
00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:10.490
<v Speaker 1>You enter into a difficult area though</v>
<v Speaker 1>when labeling American sniper as anti</v>

68
00:03:10.491 --> 00:03:12.730
<v Speaker 1>war,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which I don't think is necessarily</v>

69
00:03:12.731 --> 00:03:15.040
<v Speaker 1>defined by showing the destructiveness</v>
<v Speaker 1>of war,</v>

70
00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:19.360
<v Speaker 1>but rather by to what extent the</v>
<v Speaker 1>destruction can be justified in the end</v>

71
00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:21.210
<v Speaker 1>as we're American sniper.</v>

72
00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:25.330
<v Speaker 1>The fact that he did get his bad guy at</v>
<v Speaker 1>the end and got a big funeral parade and</v>

73
00:03:25.331 --> 00:03:26.830
<v Speaker 1>hero status.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Granted,</v>

74
00:03:26.831 --> 00:03:30.700
<v Speaker 1>not by everyone but still to me shows</v>
<v Speaker 1>that this is far from an antiwar film.</v>

75
00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:34.060
<v Speaker 1>I'm pretty sure there are plenty of</v>
<v Speaker 1>folks out there who look at a film like</v>

76
00:03:34.061 --> 00:03:36.370
<v Speaker 1>this and think it was all worth it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

77
00:03:36.371 --> 00:03:40.630
<v Speaker 1>So I believe this touches on what now</v>
<v Speaker 1>you see it has said in this video about</v>

78
00:03:40.630 --> 00:03:42.190
<v Speaker 1>war films,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you don't know him,</v>

79
00:03:42.191 --> 00:03:44.500
<v Speaker 1>he's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>another video ses who,</v>

80
00:03:44.850 --> 00:03:45.960
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is actually fairly,</v>

81
00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:48.220
<v Speaker 1>fairly popular and makes a lot of great</v>
<v Speaker 1>video.</v>

82
00:03:48.221 --> 00:03:49.054
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

83
00:03:49.100 --> 00:03:52.090
<v Speaker 1>I'll put a link to that video in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>description as well.</v>

84
00:03:52.420 --> 00:03:54.430
<v Speaker 1>Basically,</v>
<v Speaker 1>his statement is that a film can be</v>

85
00:03:54.431 --> 00:03:58.180
<v Speaker 1>defined as a pro war film if the</v>
<v Speaker 1>benefits outweigh the costs of the war,</v>

86
00:03:58.480 --> 00:04:01.720
<v Speaker 1>which he states is a thing that American</v>
<v Speaker 1>sniper shows.</v>

87
00:04:02.080 --> 00:04:06.250
<v Speaker 1>So although I agree with the observation</v>
<v Speaker 1>of what a pro war film is,</v>

88
00:04:06.251 --> 00:04:09.250
<v Speaker 1>I don't believe it fully applies to</v>
<v Speaker 1>American sniper.</v>

89
00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:13.690
<v Speaker 1>So as I've shown in my video,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the three pillars of Kyle's thinking or</v>

90
00:04:13.691 --> 00:04:17.530
<v Speaker 1>shown to be completely destructive to</v>
<v Speaker 1>family and in some ways even as military</v>

91
00:04:17.531 --> 00:04:19.360
<v Speaker 1>family as it gets to have his friends</v>
<v Speaker 1>skilled.</v>

92
00:04:19.361 --> 00:04:22.810
<v Speaker 1>So never do we see any progress in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>Iraq war as well.</v>

93
00:04:23.110 --> 00:04:25.180
<v Speaker 1>Instead,</v>
<v Speaker 1>things seem to be escalating and getting</v>

94
00:04:25.181 --> 00:04:28.330
<v Speaker 1>worse every time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Call Kyle comes back.</v>

95
00:04:28.730 --> 00:04:30.340
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then in the last battle,</v>

96
00:04:30.341 --> 00:04:33.400
<v Speaker 1>we see that even after he wants to</v>
<v Speaker 1>protect his family,</v>

97
00:04:33.401 --> 00:04:36.850
<v Speaker 1>he's still putting himself and other</v>
<v Speaker 1>soldiers in danger.</v>

98
00:04:37.650 --> 00:04:39.250
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I am going to agree with the fact that</v>

99
00:04:39.251 --> 00:04:41.860
<v Speaker 1>there should've been more of a negative</v>
<v Speaker 1>consequence for him,</v>

100
00:04:41.861 --> 00:04:46.030
<v Speaker 1>especially in that last scene which</v>
<v Speaker 1>could have been shown in one of the</v>

101
00:04:46.031 --> 00:04:49.660
<v Speaker 1>other soldiers getting killed or maimed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I'll get back to that in a little</v>

102
00:04:49.661 --> 00:04:50.410
<v Speaker 1>bit.</v>

103
00:04:50.410 --> 00:04:53.140
<v Speaker 1>Overall,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I believe that if American sniper war to</v>

104
00:04:53.141 --> 00:04:58.120
<v Speaker 1>be a heavily pro war film showing the</v>
<v Speaker 1>benefits outweighing the costs,</v>

105
00:04:58.140 --> 00:05:02.680
<v Speaker 1>the values that cow carries with him,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which are those highly conservative or</v>

106
00:05:02.800 --> 00:05:06.280
<v Speaker 1>more like neoconservative values,</v>
<v Speaker 1>would definitely not have been depicted</v>

107
00:05:06.281 --> 00:05:09.610
<v Speaker 1>to be so detrimental to family in every</v>
<v Speaker 1>shape and form.</v>

108
00:05:10.030 --> 00:05:12.490
<v Speaker 1>Instead,</v>
<v Speaker 1>those values would have been shown to be</v>

109
00:05:12.491 --> 00:05:16.030
<v Speaker 1>positive and effective in in school and</v>
<v Speaker 1>not entirely flawed.</v>

110
00:05:16.460 --> 00:05:18.120
<v Speaker 1>Also,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't believe that the film was pro</v>

111
00:05:18.121 --> 00:05:22.090
<v Speaker 1>war just for portraying someone who</v>
<v Speaker 1>personally was a belief that there isn't</v>

112
00:05:22.510 --> 00:05:24.760
<v Speaker 1>really any benefit over costs in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>film.</v>

113
00:05:24.761 --> 00:05:28.180
<v Speaker 1>We just see to work costing more and</v>
<v Speaker 1>more with less and less benefit.</v>

114
00:05:28.510 --> 00:05:30.460
<v Speaker 1>If we see benefit at all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the end,</v>

115
00:05:30.461 --> 00:05:34.330
<v Speaker 1>he dies that the war is and resolve.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The families are still being destroyed</v>

116
00:05:34.410 --> 00:05:38.170
<v Speaker 1>and tries to depict as dogmatic beliefs</v>
<v Speaker 1>the destructiveness of said beliefs and</v>

117
00:05:38.171 --> 00:05:41.710
<v Speaker 1>shows them to be more of a tragic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a flawed character.</v>

118
00:05:42.340 --> 00:05:44.170
<v Speaker 1>In my opinion.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It is,</v>

119
00:05:44.171 --> 00:05:46.540
<v Speaker 1>however,</v>
<v Speaker 1>still respectful to his intentions as a</v>

120
00:05:46.541 --> 00:05:49.570
<v Speaker 1>person,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which brings us to to portrayal of Chris</v>

121
00:05:49.570 --> 00:05:52.510
<v Speaker 1>Kyle and also our second common by</v>
<v Speaker 1>before the credits.</v>

122
00:05:52.870 --> 00:05:54.880
<v Speaker 1>I would agree with you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It wasn't for a few things.</v>

123
00:05:54.881 --> 00:05:57.560
<v Speaker 1>I see you mentioned this isn't about</v>
<v Speaker 1>kyle himself,</v>

124
00:05:57.561 --> 00:06:01.910
<v Speaker 1>but he who he was as a real person plays</v>
<v Speaker 1>a part in what the movie became.</v>

125
00:06:02.210 --> 00:06:04.610
<v Speaker 1>It seems he just wasn't a good person at</v>
<v Speaker 1>all.</v>

126
00:06:04.611 --> 00:06:07.160
<v Speaker 1>He lied a lot and it seems to love more</v>
<v Speaker 1>himself,</v>

127
00:06:07.190 --> 00:06:10.880
<v Speaker 1>which isn't shown in a movie that played</v>
<v Speaker 1>a role with the people who watching the</v>

128
00:06:10.881 --> 00:06:13.520
<v Speaker 1>movie dead look more into them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All right,</v>

129
00:06:13.521 --> 00:06:17.780
<v Speaker 1>so this touches on a part of the films</v>
<v Speaker 1>criticism that I believe hold some</v>

130
00:06:17.781 --> 00:06:21.170
<v Speaker 1>truth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Clint Eastwood is very obviously careful</v>

131
00:06:21.171 --> 00:06:23.990
<v Speaker 1>to not portray cow as a person in a</v>
<v Speaker 1>negative light,</v>

132
00:06:24.460 --> 00:06:28.610
<v Speaker 1>and as Bradley Cooper has stated,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the film actively tries to put emphasis</v>

133
00:06:28.611 --> 00:06:31.400
<v Speaker 1>on veterans and honors their plight in</v>
<v Speaker 1>the process.</v>

134
00:06:32.110 --> 00:06:35.540
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think the certain Lakin nuanced depth</v>

135
00:06:35.541 --> 00:06:38.840
<v Speaker 1>and Kyle's character makes that some of</v>
<v Speaker 1>the antiwar elements might've become</v>

136
00:06:38.841 --> 00:06:41.240
<v Speaker 1>overshadowed and angry if that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

137
00:06:41.950 --> 00:06:44.360
<v Speaker 1>I've only read a little bit about the</v>
<v Speaker 1>controversy surrounding him,</v>

138
00:06:44.361 --> 00:06:47.750
<v Speaker 1>so I don't know how much of it is true</v>
<v Speaker 1>or whether this was known to,</v>

139
00:06:47.751 --> 00:06:51.260
<v Speaker 1>to filmmakers are in production.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But what I do know to be true is that</v>

140
00:06:51.261 --> 00:06:54.140
<v Speaker 1>Carl has stated in his autobiography to</v>
<v Speaker 1>have enjoyed,</v>

141
00:06:54.470 --> 00:06:56.930
<v Speaker 1>to have enjoyed killing people in Iraq,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is,</v>

142
00:06:56.980 --> 00:06:57.940
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

143
00:06:58.330 --> 00:06:59.260
<v Speaker 1>something that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

144
00:06:59.310 --> 00:07:01.300
<v Speaker 1>before the credits touched on in his</v>
<v Speaker 1>comment.</v>

145
00:07:01.700 --> 00:07:03.920
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is something that's only subtly</v>

146
00:07:03.921 --> 00:07:05.240
<v Speaker 1>hinted at the movie.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think,</v>

147
00:07:05.310 --> 00:07:06.250
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

148
00:07:06.420 --> 00:07:08.840
<v Speaker 1>as you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can see tyack questioning Kyle's</v>

149
00:07:08.841 --> 00:07:10.080
<v Speaker 1>real intentions,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

150
00:07:10.160 --> 00:07:13.300
<v Speaker 1>as he wants to go back for a fourth time</v>
<v Speaker 1>because she doesn't believe that he's</v>

151
00:07:13.310 --> 00:07:15.140
<v Speaker 1>doing it to protect his family's</v>
<v Speaker 1>anymore.</v>

152
00:07:15.320 --> 00:07:17.330
<v Speaker 1>But for other,</v>
<v Speaker 1>more personal reasons,</v>

153
00:07:17.580 --> 00:07:19.670
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I think the film mainly explains</v>

154
00:07:19.671 --> 00:07:22.730
<v Speaker 1>isn't as obsession with killing the</v>
<v Speaker 1>people responsible for murdering his</v>

155
00:07:22.731 --> 00:07:23.530
<v Speaker 1>friends.</v>

156
00:07:23.530 --> 00:07:26.500
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I would agree that the antiwar</v>

157
00:07:26.510 --> 00:07:30.230
<v Speaker 1>message would have been clear if this</v>
<v Speaker 1>would have been implemented,</v>

158
00:07:30.620 --> 00:07:31.490
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>his,</v>

159
00:07:31.520 --> 00:07:35.960
<v Speaker 1>his enjoyment of killing and would have</v>
<v Speaker 1>benefited the quality and the honesty of</v>

160
00:07:35.961 --> 00:07:37.850
<v Speaker 1>the film in general if,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if,</v>

161
00:07:37.940 --> 00:07:40.370
<v Speaker 1>if this aspect of college would have</v>
<v Speaker 1>been shown in the movie.</v>

162
00:07:40.730 --> 00:07:41.920
<v Speaker 1>But I do understand that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

163
00:07:42.030 --> 00:07:44.140
<v Speaker 1>this would have probably never happened,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

164
00:07:44.150 --> 00:07:46.310
<v Speaker 1>even if Clint Eastwood would have wanted</v>
<v Speaker 1>to implement it,</v>

165
00:07:46.340 --> 00:07:50.160
<v Speaker 1>the guy had just been shot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I think they were extra careful in</v>

166
00:07:50.161 --> 00:07:51.920
<v Speaker 1>this portrayal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And besides that,</v>

167
00:07:51.921 --> 00:07:55.340
<v Speaker 1>there's also the possibility that the</v>
<v Speaker 1>studio just wanted to play it safer for</v>

168
00:07:55.341 --> 00:07:59.510
<v Speaker 1>a big audience and that might have</v>
<v Speaker 1>opened the door for a more pro</v>

169
00:07:59.511 --> 00:08:02.270
<v Speaker 1>neoconservative viewing of the film.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

170
00:08:02.690 --> 00:08:05.030
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is not Francis Ford Coppola</v>

171
00:08:05.060 --> 00:08:08.240
<v Speaker 1>prancing around half naked in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>Philippine jungles and his own budget.</v>

172
00:08:08.241 --> 00:08:13.241
<v Speaker 1>So I doubt East we'd had complete</v>
<v Speaker 1>liberty in this unless someone can prove</v>

173
00:08:13.281 --> 00:08:13.970
<v Speaker 1>me wrong,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of course.</v>

174
00:08:13.970 --> 00:08:16.460
<v Speaker 1>But that brings us to a number of</v>
<v Speaker 1>questions.</v>

175
00:08:16.850 --> 00:08:21.170
<v Speaker 1>Does Clint Eastwood and directors of war</v>
<v Speaker 1>films in general hold a responsibility</v>

176
00:08:21.171 --> 00:08:25.310
<v Speaker 1>in the interpretation of their films?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So even if you personally wanted to make</v>

177
00:08:25.311 --> 00:08:29.870
<v Speaker 1>it predominantly anti war film,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm having part of the audience</v>

178
00:08:29.871 --> 00:08:34.610
<v Speaker 1>interpreted as a pro war film,</v>
<v Speaker 1>does that mean that it is his failure or</v>

179
00:08:34.611 --> 00:08:38.840
<v Speaker 1>failure on his part or is it a failure</v>
<v Speaker 1>on the audience's part to misinterpret</v>

180
00:08:38.841 --> 00:08:41.620
<v Speaker 1>the film?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Does that mean that we have to do away</v>

181
00:08:41.670 --> 00:08:44.060
<v Speaker 1>with subtlety when it comes to sensitive</v>
<v Speaker 1>topics,</v>

182
00:08:44.061 --> 00:08:48.870
<v Speaker 1>does that mean that we have to limit a</v>
<v Speaker 1>director's liberty and in,</v>

183
00:08:48.960 --> 00:08:51.250
<v Speaker 1>in showing his own view,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

184
00:08:51.350 --> 00:08:55.890
<v Speaker 1>or to be political correct.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Politically correct in depicting of</v>

185
00:08:55.891 --> 00:08:58.860
<v Speaker 1>these sensitive topics?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Or is it to be found in the apparent,</v>

186
00:08:58.890 --> 00:09:02.670
<v Speaker 1>this honest portrayal of Chris Kyle,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even though it was only meant to be</v>

187
00:09:02.671 --> 00:09:06.690
<v Speaker 1>roughly based on his life,</v>
<v Speaker 1>are in bio pics in essence problematic</v>

188
00:09:06.691 --> 00:09:09.300
<v Speaker 1>when it comes to creating a fake</v>
<v Speaker 1>narrative around a real person?</v>

189
00:09:09.570 --> 00:09:12.960
<v Speaker 1>Or is it all just fiction and people</v>
<v Speaker 1>shouldn't learn history from fiction</v>

190
00:09:12.961 --> 00:09:14.240
<v Speaker 1>films.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Alright.</v>

191
00:09:14.280 --> 00:09:17.730
<v Speaker 1>So those are some of the questions that</v>
<v Speaker 1>popped up for me and that could further</v>

192
00:09:17.731 --> 00:09:20.910
<v Speaker 1>the conversation in the comments section</v>
<v Speaker 1>because I want to know what you think</v>

193
00:09:20.911 --> 00:09:24.020
<v Speaker 1>about this personally and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and what your views are a,</v>

194
00:09:24.120 --> 00:09:27.180
<v Speaker 1>I think with that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've set most of what I intended to say</v>

195
00:09:27.181 --> 00:09:31.280
<v Speaker 1>and I hope I provided you have some</v>
<v Speaker 1>further context in ways to further the</v>

196
00:09:31.310 --> 00:09:33.030
<v Speaker 1>conversation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

197
00:09:33.090 --> 00:09:37.380
<v Speaker 1>of course I appreciate constructively,</v>
<v Speaker 1>constructively post varying viewpoints</v>

198
00:09:37.400 --> 00:09:40.410
<v Speaker 1>of which I'm looking forward to seeing</v>
<v Speaker 1>more in this common section.</v>

199
00:09:40.880 --> 00:09:42.030
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>thank you all for watching.</v>
