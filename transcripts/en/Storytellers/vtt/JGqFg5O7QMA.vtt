1
00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:05.190
<v Speaker 1>I've always found it intriguing that</v>
<v Speaker 1>Martin Scorsese,</v>

2
00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:07.560
<v Speaker 1>goodfellas starts it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Story here,</v>

3
00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:10.240
<v Speaker 1>a car on a deserted road.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Our protagonist,</v>

4
00:00:10.270 --> 00:00:13.560
<v Speaker 1>Henry Hill,</v>
<v Speaker 1>behind wheel is travel companions dozing</v>

5
00:00:13.561 --> 00:00:15.660
<v Speaker 1>off in the background.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No dawn's,</v>

6
00:00:15.661 --> 00:00:18.260
<v Speaker 1>no Tuxedos,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no highbrow melodrama,</v>

7
00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:21.780
<v Speaker 1>just three guys sitting in a car trying</v>
<v Speaker 1>to pass the time,</v>

8
00:00:22.110 --> 00:00:24.110
<v Speaker 1>a scene,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so mundane and so relatable.</v>

9
00:00:24.130 --> 00:00:28.650
<v Speaker 1>Other than these few fleeting seconds</v>
<v Speaker 1>you along with our companions here would</v>

10
00:00:28.651 --> 00:00:30.840
<v Speaker 1>almost forget that this is a gangster</v>
<v Speaker 1>movie.</v>

11
00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:36.480
<v Speaker 1>Of course,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Chris says he's just setting us up for</v>

12
00:00:36.481 --> 00:00:40.940
<v Speaker 1>an early shock reveal</v>
<v Speaker 1>and just like that.</v>

13
00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:45.020
<v Speaker 1>We stopped relating and it's through</v>
<v Speaker 1>relative ease in which Tommy and Jimmy</v>

14
00:00:45.021 --> 00:00:47.990
<v Speaker 1>finished off her begging victim.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That throws us off even more.</v>

15
00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:52.520
<v Speaker 1>Yet we're intrigued.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Social Studies switch the focus to</v>

16
00:00:52.521 --> 00:00:54.050
<v Speaker 1>Henry,</v>
<v Speaker 1>his face lit,</v>

17
00:00:54.051 --> 00:00:56.630
<v Speaker 1>read like he's staring straight into</v>
<v Speaker 1>hell itself.</v>

18
00:00:57.040 --> 00:01:01.080
<v Speaker 1>We didn't invites us to join him and be</v>
<v Speaker 1>our guide in this journey of the bace in</v>

19
00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:05.630
<v Speaker 1>sin and what's become known as one of</v>
<v Speaker 1>the most famous lines in gangster film</v>

20
00:01:05.631 --> 00:01:07.910
<v Speaker 1>history.</v>
<v Speaker 1>As far back as I can remember,</v>

21
00:01:07.911 --> 00:01:09.290
<v Speaker 1>I always wanted to be a gangster</v>

22
00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:21.800
<v Speaker 1>opening credits barely having passed by.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We can already tell that Scorsese,</v>

23
00:01:21.801 --> 00:01:24.800
<v Speaker 1>yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they can have 180 degree turn away from</v>

24
00:01:24.801 --> 00:01:28.970
<v Speaker 1>another a gangster movie because instead</v>
<v Speaker 1>of directing his attention upwards on</v>

25
00:01:28.971 --> 00:01:32.240
<v Speaker 1>larger than life characters at the very</v>
<v Speaker 1>top of the mafia hierarchy,</v>

26
00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:35.920
<v Speaker 1>score says he chooses to put the</v>
<v Speaker 1>spotlight on the blue color gangsters</v>

27
00:01:35.930 --> 00:01:40.620
<v Speaker 1>down below in the streets of Queens.</v>
<v Speaker 1>New York didn't find this focal point</v>

28
00:01:40.621 --> 00:01:43.910
<v Speaker 1>and attempted gays.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Have an everyday kid who's only desire</v>

29
00:01:43.911 --> 00:01:47.840
<v Speaker 1>is to become somebody in a world of</v>
<v Speaker 1>nobodies and restore your,</v>

30
00:01:47.841 --> 00:01:50.150
<v Speaker 1>of course is an adaptation of Nicholas</v>
<v Speaker 1>Pileggi book,</v>

31
00:01:50.151 --> 00:01:52.660
<v Speaker 1>White Sky,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which chronicles the life in crime with</v>

32
00:01:52.661 --> 00:01:56.780
<v Speaker 1>the real Henry Hill Square says you</v>
<v Speaker 1>supposedly was so impressed by the</v>

33
00:01:56.781 --> 00:02:00.800
<v Speaker 1>gritty realism and attention to detail</v>
<v Speaker 1>the boot that he decided to treat his</v>

34
00:02:00.801 --> 00:02:03.200
<v Speaker 1>movie adaptation like a stage</v>
<v Speaker 1>documentary,</v>

35
00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:06.380
<v Speaker 1>and we'd attempt to at least preserve</v>
<v Speaker 1>the spirit of adaptive manner.</v>

36
00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:10.150
<v Speaker 1>The most obvious result of which is</v>
<v Speaker 1>conveyed in score says you still have</v>

37
00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:10.993
<v Speaker 1>the voiceover.</v>

38
00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:17.850
<v Speaker 1>One day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One day,</v>

39
00:02:17.851 --> 00:02:20.880
<v Speaker 1>some of the kids from the neighborhood</v>
<v Speaker 1>carried my mother's groceries all the</v>

40
00:02:20.881 --> 00:02:24.820
<v Speaker 1>way home.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It would perhaps be more fitting to</v>

41
00:02:24.821 --> 00:02:29.380
<v Speaker 1>rebrand Henry's recurring voiceover as a</v>
<v Speaker 1>sort of audio commentary about his own</v>

42
00:02:29.381 --> 00:02:31.960
<v Speaker 1>rise and fall.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's almost like we're watching the</v>

43
00:02:31.961 --> 00:02:34.330
<v Speaker 1>footage with Henry in every now and</v>
<v Speaker 1>then.</v>

44
00:02:34.331 --> 00:02:38.320
<v Speaker 1>He pauses the film at various important</v>
<v Speaker 1>points you provide us with additional</v>

45
00:02:38.321 --> 00:02:39.760
<v Speaker 1>information.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Henry's wife,</v>

46
00:02:39.761 --> 00:02:42.280
<v Speaker 1>Karen,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is also featured in the voiceover which</v>

47
00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:47.370
<v Speaker 1>adds to the talking heads documentary</v>
<v Speaker 1>like feel of the movie which were says</v>

48
00:02:47.381 --> 00:02:50.560
<v Speaker 1>he stopped just short of actually</v>
<v Speaker 1>showing us Henry watching and</v>

49
00:02:50.561 --> 00:02:54.100
<v Speaker 1>compensating on the food issue himself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The end result of the strive for realism</v>

50
00:02:54.101 --> 00:02:58.240
<v Speaker 1>is that we get the feeling that what</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're watching is truly authentic slice</v>

51
00:02:58.241 --> 00:03:03.040
<v Speaker 1>of life for you to over romanticizing</v>
<v Speaker 1>with actors behaving redder than acting,</v>

52
00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:06.790
<v Speaker 1>but quite paradoxically.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's precisely this aspect of the movie</v>

53
00:03:06.791 --> 00:03:10.090
<v Speaker 1>that makes us get drawn into Henry's</v>
<v Speaker 1>experiences even more.</v>

54
00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:14.330
<v Speaker 1>Your watch closely how Henry guides us</v>
<v Speaker 1>through his teams as you rationalizes</v>

55
00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:17.290
<v Speaker 1>away,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why he chose the life right up until the</v>

56
00:03:17.291 --> 00:03:20.790
<v Speaker 1>point that we see him as a full grown</v>
<v Speaker 1>self proclaimed wiseguy.</v>

57
00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:23.980
<v Speaker 1>From that point on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we hang out with his friends at the bar</v>

58
00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:26.830
<v Speaker 1>you listened to and laugh at Zombie</v>
<v Speaker 1>stories.</v>

59
00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:30.700
<v Speaker 1>We share a shock as the tension builds</v>
<v Speaker 1>and we realized that laughing might not</v>

60
00:03:30.701 --> 00:03:32.680
<v Speaker 1>have been such a great idea after all</v>

61
00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:40.590
<v Speaker 2>to</v>
<v Speaker 2>talk.</v>

62
00:03:42.460 --> 00:03:46.120
<v Speaker 1>We Watch Henry find love.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We even get to see his personal holiday.</v>

63
00:03:46.121 --> 00:03:50.350
<v Speaker 1>Pictures were sucked in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We rapidly become part of Henry Story to</v>

64
00:03:50.351 --> 00:03:55.150
<v Speaker 1>such an extent that at times we</v>
<v Speaker 1>experience it through his own eyes or as</v>

65
00:03:55.151 --> 00:03:58.990
<v Speaker 1>a sort of extension of himself as he</v>
<v Speaker 1>introduces us to all of his wife's guy</v>

66
00:03:58.991 --> 00:04:02.140
<v Speaker 1>friends in the bamboo bar,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but of course there's really only one</v>

67
00:04:02.141 --> 00:04:04.480
<v Speaker 1>scene that captures this feeling</v>
<v Speaker 1>perfectly.</v>

68
00:04:05.330 --> 00:04:09.490
<v Speaker 1>Copacabana scene really is the apex of</v>
<v Speaker 1>seduction in the film and this three</v>

69
00:04:09.491 --> 00:04:13.120
<v Speaker 1>minute long tracking shot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're positioned right behind Henry and</v>

70
00:04:13.121 --> 00:04:16.240
<v Speaker 1>Karen who are going on our first serious</v>
<v Speaker 1>date in the background,</v>

71
00:04:16.241 --> 00:04:18.180
<v Speaker 1>a song.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then he kissed me by crystal,</v>

72
00:04:18.250 --> 00:04:22.510
<v Speaker 1>starts to play a playful oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to seduction itself by taking it back to</v>

73
00:04:22.511 --> 00:04:24.910
<v Speaker 1>her entrance.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Henry shows that he's no longer waiting</v>

74
00:04:24.911 --> 00:04:28.020
<v Speaker 1>around like everyone else,</v>
<v Speaker 1>ironically is a sentence.</v>

75
00:04:28.021 --> 00:04:33.010
<v Speaker 1>You power is then shown by the sense</v>
<v Speaker 1>into the basement door magically opens</v>

76
00:04:33.030 --> 00:04:36.130
<v Speaker 1>for a couple when we entered a lower</v>
<v Speaker 1>corridors of the venue,</v>

77
00:04:36.430 --> 00:04:40.450
<v Speaker 1>athlete colored red as if the two F</v>
<v Speaker 1>major descends into the realms of the</v>

78
00:04:40.451 --> 00:04:43.660
<v Speaker 1>underworld or hell itself everywhere at</v>
<v Speaker 1>a law.</v>

79
00:04:43.660 --> 00:04:46.390
<v Speaker 1>People read.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Henry is Karen walks beside him and</v>

80
00:04:47.110 --> 00:04:49.720
<v Speaker 1>that's a shot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Moves on and dawns on us at the scene</v>

81
00:04:49.721 --> 00:04:52.300
<v Speaker 1>isn't just all about Henry's moving with</v>
<v Speaker 1>Karen.</v>

82
00:04:52.680 --> 00:04:56.560
<v Speaker 1>No Scorsese has stated himself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's also about the lifestyles to</v>

83
00:04:56.561 --> 00:05:01.300
<v Speaker 1>deucing him because it symbolizes</v>
<v Speaker 1>Henry's achieve goals of recognition and</v>

84
00:05:01.301 --> 00:05:05.440
<v Speaker 1>social mobility as he moves into the</v>
<v Speaker 1>club from the back and ends up right at</v>

85
00:05:05.441 --> 00:05:08.500
<v Speaker 1>the center of the stage.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a brilliant scene which captures</v>

86
00:05:08.501 --> 00:05:13.180
<v Speaker 1>what scholar folio or Zito as called the</v>
<v Speaker 1>kinetic energy of the film perfectly,</v>

87
00:05:13.660 --> 00:05:16.380
<v Speaker 1>and it's this energy that binds</v>
<v Speaker 1>Scorsese's dry for real,</v>

88
00:05:16.520 --> 00:05:19.630
<v Speaker 1>as tendency towards expressive</v>
<v Speaker 1>stylization that you get her,</v>

89
00:05:19.690 --> 00:05:23.020
<v Speaker 1>which seduce us as much as it does Henry</v>
<v Speaker 1>and Karen.</v>

90
00:05:23.320 --> 00:05:26.800
<v Speaker 1>It's an energy that moves the story</v>
<v Speaker 1>forward and provides them with an almost</v>

91
00:05:26.801 --> 00:05:29.950
<v Speaker 1>unending momentum is the ease with which</v>
<v Speaker 1>things come.</v>

92
00:05:29.951 --> 00:05:34.120
<v Speaker 1>The amount of freedom and control henry</v>
<v Speaker 1>has over his own life that transport him</v>

93
00:05:34.121 --> 00:05:34.954
<v Speaker 1>forward.</v>

94
00:05:35.740 --> 00:05:38.570
<v Speaker 1>I could do anything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The fact that Henry says this while he</v>

95
00:05:38.571 --> 00:05:43.270
<v Speaker 1>was parking cars as a fitting metaphor</v>
<v Speaker 1>for his sense of mobility and especially</v>

96
00:05:43.271 --> 00:05:45.610
<v Speaker 1>considering the historical context with</v>
<v Speaker 1>the fifties,</v>

97
00:05:45.611 --> 00:05:49.060
<v Speaker 1>with cars being produced en masse and</v>
<v Speaker 1>President Eisenhower proposing to</v>

98
00:05:49.061 --> 00:05:54.061
<v Speaker 1>interstate highway plan in 1955 square</v>
<v Speaker 1>says he then use it as newly increased</v>

99
00:05:54.071 --> 00:05:58.010
<v Speaker 1>freedom of movement as a Motif for both</v>
<v Speaker 1>Henry's as well as the film's own</v>

100
00:05:58.011 --> 00:06:01.490
<v Speaker 1>momentum as can already be observed here</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the opening.</v>

101
00:06:01.491 --> 00:06:06.440
<v Speaker 1>Credits</v>
<v Speaker 1>for Henry car signify a sense of total</v>

102
00:06:06.441 --> 00:06:09.980
<v Speaker 1>control as he sees himself as a driver</v>
<v Speaker 1>of his own life.</v>

103
00:06:10.070 --> 00:06:13.490
<v Speaker 1>This feeling gives henry the impression</v>
<v Speaker 1>that he can do whatever you desires,</v>

104
00:06:13.520 --> 00:06:17.840
<v Speaker 1>like blatantly cheating on his wife and</v>
<v Speaker 1>dealing in cocaine despite of the fact</v>

105
00:06:17.841 --> 00:06:22.330
<v Speaker 1>that Bali told them not to and he's busy</v>
<v Speaker 1>living life in the fast lane,</v>

106
00:06:22.370 --> 00:06:25.490
<v Speaker 1>separated from the rest of us until he</v>
<v Speaker 1>isn't.</v>

107
00:06:28.250 --> 00:06:32.690
<v Speaker 1>Perception does build on and sustained</v>
<v Speaker 1>by the loss of freedom for some and the</v>

108
00:06:32.691 --> 00:06:37.580
<v Speaker 1>loss of life or others are protagonists</v>
<v Speaker 1>are always scared of losing control or</v>

109
00:06:37.581 --> 00:06:39.650
<v Speaker 1>being perceived as someone who founded,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is white,</v>

110
00:06:39.670 --> 00:06:43.490
<v Speaker 1>Tommy you can handle being put down and</v>
<v Speaker 1>why Jimmy becomes increasingly paranoid</v>

111
00:06:43.491 --> 00:06:46.940
<v Speaker 1>after the Loofah is our rate,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is this combination of fear and greed</v>

112
00:06:46.941 --> 00:06:50.210
<v Speaker 1>that ultimately puts a full stop to the</v>
<v Speaker 1>momentum of Henry's fruit,</v>

113
00:06:50.211 --> 00:06:53.480
<v Speaker 1>a year long ride,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and we come to the conclusion that</v>

114
00:06:53.481 --> 00:06:58.481
<v Speaker 1>despite having had everything actually</v>
<v Speaker 1>had very little sense of control,</v>

115
00:06:58.521 --> 00:07:02.360
<v Speaker 1>has always been in the hands of Bali.</v>
<v Speaker 1>His friends can turn into enemies in</v>

116
00:07:02.361 --> 00:07:05.720
<v Speaker 1>mere seconds,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so he ends his story where he left off</v>

117
00:07:05.810 --> 00:07:09.800
<v Speaker 1>in the state of motionless as a rat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Moving then drives away from his new</v>

118
00:07:09.801 --> 00:07:11.840
<v Speaker 1>house,</v>
<v Speaker 1>signifying the life,</v>

119
00:07:11.841 --> 00:07:14.720
<v Speaker 1>leaving him behind,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and we of course is aware that we've</v>

120
00:07:14.721 --> 00:07:18.440
<v Speaker 1>been watching as he breaks the fourth</v>
<v Speaker 1>wall right here and the court can mean</v>

121
00:07:18.460 --> 00:07:19.293
<v Speaker 1>anything.</v>

122
00:07:19.330 --> 00:07:24.330
<v Speaker 1>I was broke</v>
<v Speaker 1>or he has consciously been our guide,</v>

123
00:07:24.561 --> 00:07:28.850
<v Speaker 1>our brotherly demon throughout the film,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and we empathize with him because his</v>

124
00:07:28.851 --> 00:07:33.800
<v Speaker 1>desire is to an extent our own henry's</v>
<v Speaker 1>been seduced by life and he doesn't</v>

125
00:07:33.801 --> 00:07:35.800
<v Speaker 1>regret it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and according to Scorsese,</v>

126
00:07:35.970 --> 00:07:39.710
<v Speaker 1>we are all sinners and we can all</v>
<v Speaker 1>empathize with the characters to do is</v>

127
00:07:39.711 --> 00:07:43.270
<v Speaker 1>my money and power because those</v>
<v Speaker 1>beginning shots of Henry staring out of</v>

128
00:07:43.280 --> 00:07:47.090
<v Speaker 1>his window reflect not only his own</v>
<v Speaker 1>longing for wealth recognition and</v>

129
00:07:47.091 --> 00:07:50.060
<v Speaker 1>control,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but also and perhaps more importantly,</v>

130
00:07:50.061 --> 00:07:52.820
<v Speaker 1>our own voyeuristic gaze into our</v>
<v Speaker 1>protagonist,</v>

131
00:07:52.821 --> 00:07:56.510
<v Speaker 1>sinful in the grief world,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and we just just helped us open up the</v>

132
00:07:56.511 --> 00:08:00.470
<v Speaker 1>blinders to give us a better look</v>
<v Speaker 1>consumer life because he knows all too</v>

133
00:08:00.471 --> 00:08:03.530
<v Speaker 1>well that although we've just been</v>
<v Speaker 1>watching from the sidelines,</v>

134
00:08:03.531 --> 00:08:07.490
<v Speaker 1>there's something very deep inside of us</v>
<v Speaker 1>all that might just be asking you</v>

135
00:08:07.630 --> 00:08:08.470
