1
00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:07.170
<v Speaker 1>Just as from many others.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My childhood and adolescence,</v>

2
00:00:07.171 --> 00:00:12.171
<v Speaker 1>we're in a way defines by jk rowling,</v>
<v Speaker 1>magical world of how we boller growing</v>

3
00:00:13.141 --> 00:00:16.740
<v Speaker 1>up about a year or two younger than</v>
<v Speaker 1>Harry Potter was in the books when they</v>

4
00:00:16.741 --> 00:00:21.660
<v Speaker 1>were released a reds and still reread</v>
<v Speaker 1>the magical adventure mysteries that</v>

5
00:00:21.661 --> 00:00:26.070
<v Speaker 1>went from children's books to as the</v>
<v Speaker 1>neuro titus dates increasingly dark,</v>

6
00:00:26.071 --> 00:00:29.600
<v Speaker 1>increasingly nuanced treatments of</v>
<v Speaker 1>character and blood.</v>

7
00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:31.560
<v Speaker 1>This gradual shift,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of course,</v>

8
00:00:31.561 --> 00:00:36.120
<v Speaker 1>whilst carefully planned out by jk</v>
<v Speaker 1>rowling long before she started writing,</v>

9
00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:40.740
<v Speaker 1>she spent several years carefully</v>
<v Speaker 1>constructing the full saga and writing</v>

10
00:00:40.741 --> 00:00:45.090
<v Speaker 1>extensive background stories for the</v>
<v Speaker 1>major characters before she started on</v>

11
00:00:45.091 --> 00:00:46.680
<v Speaker 1>the first book.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

12
00:00:46.681 --> 00:00:51.090
<v Speaker 1>rollings books are filled with</v>
<v Speaker 1>references to mythology and other</v>

13
00:00:51.091 --> 00:00:53.670
<v Speaker 1>writers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>As John granger states,</v>

14
00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:58.170
<v Speaker 1>Ronin storytelling reveals traditional</v>
<v Speaker 1>artists three with symbols and themes</v>

15
00:00:58.171 --> 00:01:01.110
<v Speaker 1>borrowed from Dante Shakespeare,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the inklings,</v>

16
00:01:01.111 --> 00:01:05.460
<v Speaker 1>and other literary greats I Republican</v>
<v Speaker 1>things teams like friendship,</v>

17
00:01:05.490 --> 00:01:08.370
<v Speaker 1>good versus evil and racism and</v>
<v Speaker 1>oppression.</v>

18
00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:12.000
<v Speaker 1>However,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want to focus on what I considered the</v>

19
00:01:12.001 --> 00:01:14.280
<v Speaker 1>two most important themes in how we</v>
<v Speaker 1>bother.</v>

20
00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:16.320
<v Speaker 1>It's philosophy of laugh</v>

21
00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:17.783
<v Speaker 2>debt.</v>

22
00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:34.370
<v Speaker 1>From the very beginning.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We can see death.</v>

23
00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:39.350
<v Speaker 1>Death's plays a major role in Harry</v>
<v Speaker 1>father and it becomes clear that in jk</v>

24
00:01:39.351 --> 00:01:43.340
<v Speaker 1>Rowling swirls,</v>
<v Speaker 1>death isn't seen in binary terms in the</v>

25
00:01:43.341 --> 00:01:47.690
<v Speaker 1>wizarding world to can be nuances</v>
<v Speaker 1>between being death and being alive.</v>

26
00:01:47.930 --> 00:01:52.930
<v Speaker 1>The primary example of this is of course</v>
<v Speaker 1>for the Moritz who chases immortality by</v>

27
00:01:53.180 --> 00:01:56.420
<v Speaker 1>two murder,</v>
<v Speaker 1>ripping a solo in pieces and storing</v>

28
00:01:56.421 --> 00:02:00.830
<v Speaker 1>them in valuable artifacts.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He cannot die as long as the pieces of</v>

29
00:02:00.831 --> 00:02:04.040
<v Speaker 1>his saw our bounce to earth within these</v>
<v Speaker 1>artifacts,</v>

30
00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:09.640
<v Speaker 1>I think for the moth is clearly inspired</v>
<v Speaker 1>by Gothic fill such as Frankenstein</v>

31
00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:15.230
<v Speaker 1>Dracula and Jacqueline and hate all our</v>
<v Speaker 1>intelligence scholars who attempt to</v>

32
00:02:15.231 --> 00:02:18.650
<v Speaker 1>meddle with the loss of nature with life</v>
<v Speaker 1>and death.</v>

33
00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:22.540
<v Speaker 1>The law for it already is strikingly</v>
<v Speaker 1>clear from the data's there,</v>

34
00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:25.340
<v Speaker 1>Carrie.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There are doctors counts and involve</v>

35
00:02:25.341 --> 00:02:28.420
<v Speaker 1>them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Warts case a lord as John granger stays,</v>

36
00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:31.130
<v Speaker 1>they are men of my thin body.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Without spirit,</v>

37
00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:36.370
<v Speaker 1>there is no end even there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It is out of a bow</v>

38
00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:48.050
<v Speaker 1>like many godick villains for the artist</v>
<v Speaker 1>is only concerned with the eternal life</v>

39
00:02:48.051 --> 00:02:51.890
<v Speaker 1>of his mind and body.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Instead of turn the life of his spirit</v>

40
00:02:51.891 --> 00:02:56.891
<v Speaker 1>and saw these willing to split and maim</v>
<v Speaker 1>has saw into pieces in order to preserve</v>

41
00:02:57.681 --> 00:03:01.150
<v Speaker 1>his earthly might embody.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Even though he's worn that spending your</v>

42
00:03:01.151 --> 00:03:05.620
<v Speaker 1>soul is a terrible natural thing to do</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's a soul is to remain in tech.</v>

43
00:03:08.050 --> 00:03:08.883
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>

44
00:03:10.010 --> 00:03:15.010
<v Speaker 1>healing a nation against nature.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Proning stake on the soul as separate</v>

45
00:03:16.501 --> 00:03:21.130
<v Speaker 1>from the body of course goes against the</v>
<v Speaker 1>way by logical and natural scientists,</v>

46
00:03:21.131 --> 00:03:25.200
<v Speaker 1>he consciousness,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they see physical and chemical processes</v>

47
00:03:25.201 --> 00:03:29.160
<v Speaker 1>in the brain as the cost of emotional</v>
<v Speaker 1>and rational consciousness which</v>

48
00:03:29.161 --> 00:03:33.090
<v Speaker 1>disappears if one dies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The body is all there is the ID off.</v>

49
00:03:33.100 --> 00:03:35.700
<v Speaker 1>A separate soul is just a kosher</v>
<v Speaker 1>projection.</v>

50
00:03:35.701 --> 00:03:37.440
<v Speaker 1>We create.</v>
<v Speaker 1>However,</v>

51
00:03:37.441 --> 00:03:41.400
<v Speaker 1>although Ronan's notion of splitting a</v>
<v Speaker 1>soul in multiple parts is quite</v>

52
00:03:41.401 --> 00:03:44.550
<v Speaker 1>original.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The idea of a separate soul that needs</v>

53
00:03:44.551 --> 00:03:49.020
<v Speaker 1>to remain in tact or in other words and</v>
<v Speaker 1>tainted is spite of many religions</v>

54
00:03:49.021 --> 00:03:52.290
<v Speaker 1>around the world,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and this brings me to my central</v>

55
00:03:52.291 --> 00:03:55.410
<v Speaker 1>arguments.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's to Harry pulled the saga is very</v>

56
00:03:55.411 --> 00:04:00.120
<v Speaker 1>much influenced by religious and</v>
<v Speaker 1>specifically Christian symbolism and</v>

57
00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:02.430
<v Speaker 1>narratives.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There are many examples,</v>

58
00:04:02.890 --> 00:04:07.050
<v Speaker 1>specific symbolism in Harry Potter.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's can be linked to Christianity</v>

59
00:04:07.380 --> 00:04:09.090
<v Speaker 1>starting with the name,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how he father.</v>

60
00:04:10.360 --> 00:04:14.710
<v Speaker 1>Some have suggested that it's over first</v>
<v Speaker 1>to Sephora or biblical verses where</v>

61
00:04:14.740 --> 00:04:19.740
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible] is another word for God's</v>
<v Speaker 1>search as is a a 64 eight but now,</v>

62
00:04:19.931 --> 00:04:21.490
<v Speaker 1>oh Louis,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Arthur follow.</v>

63
00:04:21.491 --> 00:04:24.770
<v Speaker 1>We are the clay and Dow or other.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

64
00:04:24.771 --> 00:04:28.370
<v Speaker 1>heavy according to John Granger is a</v>
<v Speaker 1>wordplay on air.</v>

65
00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:30.700
<v Speaker 1>How we polar is this the era of garth.</v>

66
00:04:32.210 --> 00:04:32.940
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>

67
00:04:32.940 --> 00:04:35.150
<v Speaker 1>one question.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Push this even further and draw</v>

68
00:04:35.151 --> 00:04:39.260
<v Speaker 1>comparisons between Donadoni and Garth,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which would mean that Harry and</v>

69
00:04:39.261 --> 00:04:42.440
<v Speaker 1>Dumbledore's army represent Jesus and</v>
<v Speaker 1>his disciples</v>

70
00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:44.360
<v Speaker 3>professor,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he had nothing to do with that.</v>

71
00:04:44.361 --> 00:04:46.070
<v Speaker 3>It was me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>most noble of you,</v>

72
00:04:46.071 --> 00:04:48.980
<v Speaker 3>Harry,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but as has been pointed out,</v>

73
00:04:49.390 --> 00:04:50.890
<v Speaker 1>apostrophe cleared.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It says</v>

74
00:04:51.110 --> 00:04:51.943
<v Speaker 3>double doors.</v>

75
00:04:54.270 --> 00:04:56.760
<v Speaker 1>Further,</v>
<v Speaker 1>draco is the Latin word for boats,</v>

76
00:04:56.830 --> 00:05:00.610
<v Speaker 1>dragon and a serpent,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which are biblical symbols for Satan.</v>

77
00:05:00.940 --> 00:05:04.600
<v Speaker 1>Revelation 22 states.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He sees the dragon,</v>

78
00:05:04.601 --> 00:05:09.340
<v Speaker 1>that ancient serpent who is the devil</v>
<v Speaker 1>and Satan and bound him for a thousand</v>

79
00:05:09.340 --> 00:05:10.240
<v Speaker 1>years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

80
00:05:10.241 --> 00:05:15.241
<v Speaker 1>malfoy comes from the French malfoy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which translates to Beth or evil faith.</v>

81
00:05:16.720 --> 00:05:20.030
<v Speaker 1>DRACO malfoy is this a serpent of evil?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Faith.</v>

82
00:05:20.530 --> 00:05:21.490
<v Speaker 1>Seven Sophia,</v>

83
00:05:27.820 --> 00:05:30.640
<v Speaker 1>of course,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the serpent is seen lots in Harry Potter</v>

84
00:05:30.670 --> 00:05:34.870
<v Speaker 1>and it is one of the strongest</v>
<v Speaker 1>representations of the devil starting</v>

85
00:05:34.871 --> 00:05:35.920
<v Speaker 1>with the serpent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Of course,</v>

86
00:05:35.921 --> 00:05:38.650
<v Speaker 1>that's seducers Adam and eve in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>garden of Eden.</v>

87
00:05:39.190 --> 00:05:43.570
<v Speaker 1>Rolling symbolism based on animals</v>
<v Speaker 1>clearly comes from medieval Christian</v>

88
00:05:43.571 --> 00:05:48.571
<v Speaker 1>bcra which were animal stories where the</v>
<v Speaker 1>animals are infused with biblical</v>

89
00:05:48.701 --> 00:05:53.310
<v Speaker 1>meaning in Christian Bcra,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the snake and bus least equal</v>

90
00:05:53.320 --> 00:05:57.680
<v Speaker 1>representations of Satan.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Dare foods are the phoenix and stack</v>

91
00:05:57.710 --> 00:06:00.710
<v Speaker 1>while the lion,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is of course the symbol different</v>

92
00:06:00.711 --> 00:06:04.940
<v Speaker 1>door represents Jesus.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In revelation five five for example,</v>

93
00:06:04.970 --> 00:06:09.970
<v Speaker 1>Jesus is referred to as the lion of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>tribe of Judah and finally though is a</v>

94
00:06:10.281 --> 00:06:12.030
<v Speaker 1>symbol of maternal off</v>

95
00:06:30.870 --> 00:06:35.000
<v Speaker 2>after all this time</v>
<v Speaker 2>or</v>

96
00:06:39.020 --> 00:06:43.670
<v Speaker 1>John Granger also makes the argument</v>
<v Speaker 1>that and Harry Potter and the Chamber of</v>

97
00:06:43.670 --> 00:06:46.070
<v Speaker 1>Secrets,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the sort of Griffendor is a symbol for</v>

98
00:06:46.071 --> 00:06:50.060
<v Speaker 1>the Christian Cross.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Thus Harry as a representation of Jesus</v>

99
00:06:50.061 --> 00:06:53.660
<v Speaker 1>fights off the devil bus,</v>
<v Speaker 1>at least with a sword that is symbolic</v>

100
00:06:53.661 --> 00:06:58.661
<v Speaker 1>of the Christian Cross.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I could go on,</v>

101
00:07:03.421 --> 00:07:07.920
<v Speaker 1>but I would refer you to John Granger's</v>
<v Speaker 1>book looking for God and Harry Potter</v>

102
00:07:07.921 --> 00:07:11.280
<v Speaker 1>for more symbolism on the brother and</v>
<v Speaker 1>narrative level.</v>

103
00:07:11.281 --> 00:07:14.010
<v Speaker 1>The Harry Potter.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sarah can of course also be seen as a</v>

104
00:07:14.011 --> 00:07:16.350
<v Speaker 1>Christian narrative.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It is an essence,</v>

105
00:07:16.351 --> 00:07:20.010
<v Speaker 1>a story about laugh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>more specifically sacrificial laugh</v>

106
00:07:20.090 --> 00:07:20.560
<v Speaker 1>conquering</v>

107
00:07:20.560 --> 00:07:21.393
<v Speaker 2>Beth.</v>

108
00:07:30.940 --> 00:07:35.500
<v Speaker 1>The forces that defeat evil and Harry</v>
<v Speaker 1>Boulder are almost always forces of</v>

109
00:07:35.501 --> 00:07:37.540
<v Speaker 1>good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They are healing tears,</v>

110
00:07:37.600 --> 00:07:40.570
<v Speaker 1>sort that appears through bakery and</v>
<v Speaker 1>loyalty,</v>

111
00:07:40.640 --> 00:07:44.140
<v Speaker 1>a strong force of happiness and of</v>
<v Speaker 1>course laugh itself.</v>

112
00:07:48.290 --> 00:07:52.910
<v Speaker 1>La Fin Christianity put Texas saw and</v>
<v Speaker 1>pro fence a terrible faith in the</v>

113
00:07:52.911 --> 00:07:56.120
<v Speaker 1>afterlife and like Jesus died for our</v>
<v Speaker 1>sins.</v>

114
00:07:56.150 --> 00:07:59.630
<v Speaker 1>Harry sacrifices himself to protect his</v>
<v Speaker 1>loved ones</v>

115
00:08:05.790 --> 00:08:09.150
<v Speaker 1>after which he has resurrected in front</v>
<v Speaker 1>of his disciples.</v>

116
00:08:09.780 --> 00:08:14.130
<v Speaker 1>Now I myself as an atheist,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well most days and an agnostic on Psalm,</v>

117
00:08:14.131 --> 00:08:18.810
<v Speaker 1>was quite surprised to find search,</v>
<v Speaker 1>strong Christian influences in books.</v>

118
00:08:18.811 --> 00:08:23.250
<v Speaker 1>Death defined my childhood,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yet I wouldn't effort dismissed the many</v>

119
00:08:23.251 --> 00:08:27.420
<v Speaker 1>lessons that can be found in how he</v>
<v Speaker 1>father John granger describes how</v>

120
00:08:27.421 --> 00:08:32.340
<v Speaker 1>reporter as novels that satisfy a</v>
<v Speaker 1>spiritual hunger in a secular society,</v>

121
00:08:32.370 --> 00:08:35.190
<v Speaker 1>seasoned them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The power of traditional Christian</v>

122
00:08:35.191 --> 00:08:38.250
<v Speaker 1>literary arts.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And although I agree for the</v>

123
00:08:38.251 --> 00:08:42.930
<v Speaker 1>nonreligious I see in Harry Potter or a</v>
<v Speaker 1>story that is perfect to introduce to</v>

124
00:08:42.931 --> 00:08:47.931
<v Speaker 1>children or for grownups to reflect upon</v>
<v Speaker 1>the normality and inevitability of</v>

125
00:08:48.720 --> 00:08:50.510
<v Speaker 1>death.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In Harry Potter,</v>

126
00:08:50.520 --> 00:08:54.000
<v Speaker 1>a fear of death is seen as a filter</v>
<v Speaker 1>relation with death.</v>

127
00:08:54.120 --> 00:08:57.510
<v Speaker 1>Although trout,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he put her many people in some way come</v>

128
00:08:57.511 --> 00:09:01.650
<v Speaker 1>back from the afterlife.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is always described as a temporary</v>

129
00:09:01.651 --> 00:09:03.450
<v Speaker 1>or negative experience.</v>

130
00:09:04.170 --> 00:09:08.700
<v Speaker 1>People resurrected by the resurrection</v>
<v Speaker 1>stone are unhappy and don't belong on</v>

131
00:09:08.701 --> 00:09:13.400
<v Speaker 1>earth anymore and of course there's for</v>
<v Speaker 1>them worth who was fear of death lease</v>

132
00:09:13.401 --> 00:09:16.620
<v Speaker 1>into evil,</v>
<v Speaker 1>x of murder and damaging a saw.</v>

133
00:09:17.040 --> 00:09:19.680
<v Speaker 1>This slowly turns him less and less</v>
<v Speaker 1>human,</v>

134
00:09:19.681 --> 00:09:24.681
<v Speaker 1>which is emotive debt and trey to yield</v>
<v Speaker 1>cof traces back to Oscar Wilde's picture</v>

135
00:09:25.021 --> 00:09:29.100
<v Speaker 1>of Dorian Gray.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's voting's fishing of death and Harry</v>

136
00:09:29.100 --> 00:09:32.280
<v Speaker 1>Puller is death.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Death can infect be transcendence.</v>

137
00:09:32.340 --> 00:09:37.290
<v Speaker 1>One can truly become the master of death</v>
<v Speaker 1>by living with laugh and creating death</v>

138
00:09:37.291 --> 00:09:41.430
<v Speaker 1>as an old friend when he comes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We see this when Harry is in limbo after</v>

139
00:09:41.431 --> 00:09:45.390
<v Speaker 1>for the more it's quote unquote kills</v>
<v Speaker 1>him where Dumbledore tells him he can</v>

140
00:09:45.391 --> 00:09:46.710
<v Speaker 1>move on if he wants to.</v>

141
00:09:47.520 --> 00:09:48.360
<v Speaker 2>All right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>thank you.</v>

142
00:09:48.370 --> 00:09:51.570
<v Speaker 2>So desire,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you'll be able to board a train</v>

143
00:09:53.650 --> 00:09:56.960
<v Speaker 2>ready to take me</v>
<v Speaker 2>on.</v>

144
00:10:00.690 --> 00:10:04.740
<v Speaker 1>But I think there's also an important</v>
<v Speaker 1>nonreligious lesson on death,</v>

145
00:10:04.741 --> 00:10:09.330
<v Speaker 1>which can be seen in how he bother the</v>
<v Speaker 1>lesson of accepting the debt or friends</v>

146
00:10:09.331 --> 00:10:12.870
<v Speaker 1>and loved ones.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The lesson of realizing that the death</v>

147
00:10:12.871 --> 00:10:17.730
<v Speaker 1>live on in our hearts and in our</v>
<v Speaker 1>memories as Albus dumbledore tells us in</v>

148
00:10:17.731 --> 00:10:21.240
<v Speaker 1>the third book and Cvs Stenosis in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>third movie,</v>

149
00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:25.210
<v Speaker 2>it's cruel that I got to spend so much</v>
<v Speaker 2>time with James and Lillian new,</v>

150
00:10:25.320 --> 00:10:30.320
<v Speaker 2>the little note this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what's the lovefest never,</v>

151
00:10:31.391 --> 00:10:35.770
<v Speaker 2>rarely leaves</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you can always find</v>

152
00:10:39.100 --> 00:10:39.933
<v Speaker 2>it here</v>

153
00:10:43.070 --> 00:10:47.450
<v Speaker 1>and I think it is this lesson that lace</v>
<v Speaker 1>at the core of the story of how he</v>

154
00:10:47.451 --> 00:10:52.310
<v Speaker 1>father in book seven Luna answers the</v>
<v Speaker 1>question from the ego of Raven claw by</v>

155
00:10:52.311 --> 00:10:55.940
<v Speaker 1>suggesting that a circle has no</v>
<v Speaker 1>beginning all the loft ones.</v>

156
00:10:55.941 --> 00:11:00.941
<v Speaker 1>Harris last live farm as an inseparable</v>
<v Speaker 1>part of him and although ODF dice in a</v>

157
00:11:00.951 --> 00:11:04.460
<v Speaker 1>way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>their circles continue because by giving</v>

158
00:11:04.461 --> 00:11:08.600
<v Speaker 1>their names to his kids,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Lily James Serious and the others</v>

159
00:11:08.660 --> 00:11:12.800
<v Speaker 1>Devonne as much in Harris children as</v>
<v Speaker 1>they live on in himself.</v>

160
00:11:29.330 --> 00:11:31.550
<v Speaker 1>All right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Thank you all so much for watching.</v>

161
00:11:31.930 --> 00:11:36.050

162
00:11:36.051 --> 00:11:38.360
<v Speaker 1>because I just felt that it wasn't good</v>
<v Speaker 1>enough.</v>

163
00:11:38.450 --> 00:11:41.360
<v Speaker 1>And I'm still not completely satisfied,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but yeah,</v>

164
00:11:41.390 --> 00:11:42.830

<v Speaker 1>Harry Potter and it's Christian</v>
