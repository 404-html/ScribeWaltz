00:00:00.090 --> 00:00:02.430
<v Speaker 1>Thank you to dollar Shave Club for</v>
<v Speaker 1>sponsoring this video.</v>

2
00:00:02.490 --> 00:00:07.490
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's go five minutes,</v>

3
00:00:08.301 --> 00:00:09.520
<v Speaker 2>sir.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let's make some sandwiches.</v>

4
00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:32.010
<v Speaker 1>I think it's done.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's see,</v>

5
00:00:44.740 --> 00:00:45.573
<v Speaker 2>maybe two hours</v>

6
00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:51.600
<v Speaker 1>cooking and cooked food or almost as</v>
<v Speaker 1>ubiquitous in our films,</v>

7
00:00:51.601 --> 00:00:55.650
<v Speaker 1>Sdr aspects of our daily lives,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but whether you see cooked food as</v>

8
00:00:55.651 --> 00:00:59.070
<v Speaker 1>nothing more than fuel to keep your body</v>
<v Speaker 1>from buying give it does me.</v>

9
00:00:59.250 --> 00:00:59.641
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

10
00:00:59.641 --> 00:01:00.330
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

11
00:01:00.330 --> 00:01:02.310
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Get that out right now.</v>

12
00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:06.450
<v Speaker 1>Or as a piece of art that almost doesn't</v>
<v Speaker 1>deserve to be eaten.</v>

13
00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:09.090
<v Speaker 1>Oh my God.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People eat because they're hungry.</v>

14
00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:12.690
<v Speaker 1>I want to make food and makes people</v>
<v Speaker 1>stop eating for eight good filmmaker or</v>

15
00:01:12.691 --> 00:01:15.240
<v Speaker 1>writer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The Cuc Ennis food are always more than</v>

16
00:01:15.241 --> 00:01:19.650
<v Speaker 1>just a nutter prop in a scene or a cheap</v>
<v Speaker 1>way to cover up a lifeless story with</v>

17
00:01:19.651 --> 00:01:21.840
<v Speaker 1>some pleasant ICANDY.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a chef's knife.</v>

18
00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:25.260
<v Speaker 2>Look to hire</v>

19
00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:30.620
<v Speaker 1>the role of the chef as the passionate</v>
<v Speaker 1>mediator of raw nature to high culture</v>

20
00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:34.370
<v Speaker 1>has served as an APP allegory for the</v>
<v Speaker 1>process and frustrations of the</v>

21
00:01:34.371 --> 00:01:39.371
<v Speaker 1>Hollywood filmmaker bay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like the filmmaker to chef is often</v>

22
00:01:39.471 --> 00:01:43.850
<v Speaker 1>depicted as a visionary artist of sorts</v>
<v Speaker 1>who's creativity has been shackled by</v>

23
00:01:43.851 --> 00:01:46.850
<v Speaker 1>his superiors and now suddenly you're</v>
<v Speaker 1>going to be an audience will be an</v>

24
00:01:46.851 --> 00:01:50.740
<v Speaker 1>artist on your own time or who believes</v>
<v Speaker 1>his workers under appreciated?</v>

25
00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:52.520
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she's the Philistines.</v>

26
00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:56.960
<v Speaker 1>I'm going live on a dog to add or overly</v>
<v Speaker 1>critiqued by those who don't have</v>

27
00:01:56.961 --> 00:02:01.961
<v Speaker 1>anything to add themselves for the chef</v>
<v Speaker 1>to overcharge us for his insecurity and</v>

28
00:02:02.451 --> 00:02:05.930
<v Speaker 1>lack of imagination,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but beyond sly allegories the ubiquity</v>

29
00:02:05.931 --> 00:02:09.860
<v Speaker 1>of Kooks and hot dishes and cinema can</v>
<v Speaker 1>also reveal something meaningful about</v>

30
00:02:09.861 --> 00:02:14.390
<v Speaker 1>our humanity and his boot catching fire.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How cooking made us human primatologist</v>

31
00:02:14.391 --> 00:02:17.830
<v Speaker 1>Richard Wrangham made to controversial</v>
<v Speaker 1>but thought provoking claim that this is</v>

32
00:02:17.831 --> 00:02:21.800
<v Speaker 1>the act of cooking that is the primary</v>
<v Speaker 1>distinguishing feature of humanity.</v>

33
00:02:22.070 --> 00:02:25.280
<v Speaker 1>And it has played an enormous part in</v>
<v Speaker 1>our evolution as a species.</v>

34
00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:28.910
<v Speaker 1>Fucking unbelievable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We are tied to our adaptive diet of</v>

35
00:02:28.911 --> 00:02:31.940
<v Speaker 1>cooked food.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the results pervade our lives from</v>

36
00:02:31.941 --> 00:02:35.680
<v Speaker 1>our bodies to our minds.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We humans are at a cooking apes your</v>

37
00:02:35.681 --> 00:02:38.770
<v Speaker 1>creatures of the flame,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so we should indeed been our</v>

38
00:02:38.771 --> 00:02:39.950
<v Speaker 1>humanity on Kooks.</v>

39
00:02:43.210 --> 00:02:45.910
<v Speaker 1>In Ratatouille,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we can see this notion of cooking as a</v>

40
00:02:45.911 --> 00:02:49.750
<v Speaker 1>civilizing process play out in a</v>
<v Speaker 1>transformation of remy to country rat</v>

41
00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:53.200
<v Speaker 1>and to a five star chef in the culinary</v>
<v Speaker 1>capital of the world.</v>

42
00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:57.370
<v Speaker 1>Contrary to his fellow rats,</v>
<v Speaker 1>remy chooses to walk on two feet,</v>

43
00:02:57.670 --> 00:03:00.040
<v Speaker 1>cares about hygiene,</v>
<v Speaker 1>self control,</v>

44
00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:06.780
<v Speaker 1>just fork it down and learns how to read</v>
<v Speaker 1>all because of his passion for cooking.</v>

45
00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:10.880
<v Speaker 1>It's only one way to weed a brace of</v>
<v Speaker 1>Kone,</v>

46
00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:16.780
<v Speaker 1>but if cooked food can be seen as being</v>
<v Speaker 1>universally connected to civility films</v>

47
00:03:16.781 --> 00:03:19.180
<v Speaker 1>can also use this to show us its</v>
<v Speaker 1>opposite.</v>

48
00:03:23.110 --> 00:03:24.470
<v Speaker 1>What did you say?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sorry.</v>

49
00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:29.020
<v Speaker 1>Get</v>
<v Speaker 1>an old boyd.</v>

50
00:03:29.021 --> 00:03:33.060
<v Speaker 1>The main character of the story,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he eats a life on cooked octopus both in</v>

51
00:03:33.061 --> 00:03:37.450
<v Speaker 1>a desire to touch something living,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but also to reveal as d humanize state.</v>

52
00:03:37.451 --> 00:03:42.451
<v Speaker 1>After 15 years of isolated imprisonment,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he'll fight back on that menu bar,</v>

53
00:03:44.710 --> 00:03:48.390
<v Speaker 1>but consuming raw food can also serve</v>
<v Speaker 1>more practical purposes.</v>

54
00:03:49.140 --> 00:03:53.310
<v Speaker 1>The raw can come to be synonymous with</v>
<v Speaker 1>gaining natural strength and adapting</v>

55
00:03:53.311 --> 00:03:55.530
<v Speaker 1>oneself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do an uncivilized environment.</v>

56
00:03:56.820 --> 00:04:01.170
<v Speaker 1>Similarly to rules and expectations of a</v>
<v Speaker 1>warm meal can be broken to acquaint to</v>

57
00:04:01.171 --> 00:04:04.320
<v Speaker 1>civilized with the realities of an</v>
<v Speaker 1>uncivilized world.</v>

58
00:04:10.580 --> 00:04:13.690
<v Speaker 1>It's like a piece of chalk called bring</v>
<v Speaker 1>it all back,</v>

59
00:04:14.070 --> 00:04:18.840
<v Speaker 1>but this desire for the natural and the</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ra can also showcase once in capability</v>

60
00:04:18.841 --> 00:04:22.290
<v Speaker 1>of building and maintaining civilized</v>
<v Speaker 1>human relationships.</v>

61
00:04:25.920 --> 00:04:29.880
<v Speaker 1>Food can also be used to indicate it</v>
<v Speaker 1>perceived level of Savitri on a societal</v>

62
00:04:29.881 --> 00:04:32.670
<v Speaker 1>level,</v>
<v Speaker 1>be it in our own community or in those</v>

63
00:04:32.671 --> 00:04:37.380
<v Speaker 1>of others depicting morally despicable</v>
<v Speaker 1>or highly unconventional foods as</v>

64
00:04:37.381 --> 00:04:41.490
<v Speaker 1>markers of uncivility setting more</v>
<v Speaker 1>culture protagonists apart from the</v>

65
00:04:41.491 --> 00:04:43.920
<v Speaker 1>exotic and wild world which they</v>
<v Speaker 1>inhabit,</v>

66
00:04:46.170 --> 00:04:49.770
<v Speaker 1>and that when taken to its extreme,</v>
<v Speaker 1>can degenerate into perhaps the ultimate</v>

67
00:04:49.771 --> 00:04:52.470
<v Speaker 1>symbol for Savitri.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

68
00:04:52.920 --> 00:04:56.280
<v Speaker 1>We're going to fucking eat your ass.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This in turn can be used as a tool to</v>

69
00:04:56.281 --> 00:05:01.281
<v Speaker 1>completely break a character</v>
<v Speaker 1>or it can serve as a menacing and highly</v>

70
00:05:02.971 --> 00:05:05.640
<v Speaker 1>disturbing form of antagonism and in</v>
<v Speaker 1>humanity.</v>

71
00:05:10.610 --> 00:05:11.443
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Nope.</v>

72
00:05:13.490 --> 00:05:14.323
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

73
00:05:14.580 --> 00:05:19.020
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Steven Manel argue set another essential</v>

74
00:05:19.021 --> 00:05:22.350
<v Speaker 1>element of civilized food consumption is</v>
<v Speaker 1>a regulated appetite.</v>

75
00:05:22.590 --> 00:05:25.080
<v Speaker 1>The civilized don't merely eat out of</v>
<v Speaker 1>the immediate hunger,</v>

76
00:05:25.980 --> 00:05:28.530
<v Speaker 1>but collectively decide when to do so.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Together.</v>

77
00:05:30.420 --> 00:05:34.760
<v Speaker 1>I love you darling girl.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so it dinner can be to see enough</v>

78
00:05:34.770 --> 00:05:38.010
<v Speaker 1>civilized harmony,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it can also be used to invert this</v>

79
00:05:38.011 --> 00:05:40.140
<v Speaker 1>harmony,</v>
<v Speaker 1>revealing tensions between polar</v>

80
00:05:40.141 --> 00:05:44.040
<v Speaker 1>opposite characters and even devolving</v>
<v Speaker 1>into gluttony and depravity.</v>

81
00:05:44.310 --> 00:05:48.090
<v Speaker 1>Often mockingly depicting in our</v>
<v Speaker 1>problems of characters and society's</v>

82
00:05:48.091 --> 00:05:53.091
<v Speaker 1>alike.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if over abundance and wastefulness</v>

83
00:05:55.111 --> 00:05:58.220
<v Speaker 1>of food are connected to uncivility.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So with scarcity,</v>

84
00:05:58.580 --> 00:05:59.810
<v Speaker 1>you're going to die for some chickens.</v>

85
00:06:03.020 --> 00:06:06.080
<v Speaker 1>Just like in real life,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a lack of food can be utilized to bring</v>

86
00:06:06.081 --> 00:06:08.360
<v Speaker 1>about the deepest forms of humanity in</v>
<v Speaker 1>people.</v>

87
00:06:08.600 --> 00:06:11.150
<v Speaker 1>And at times the very darkest aspects</v>
<v Speaker 1>will be characters,</v>

88
00:06:11.151 --> 00:06:16.151
<v Speaker 1>personality,</v>
<v Speaker 1>cooked food can be a battle ground for</v>

89
00:06:16.611 --> 00:06:21.611
<v Speaker 1>perceived moral superiority and higher</v>
<v Speaker 1>social status and will be serving those</v>

90
00:06:22.461 --> 00:06:24.260
<v Speaker 1>who own the food,</v>
<v Speaker 1>have the most of it,</v>

91
00:06:24.261 --> 00:06:26.810
<v Speaker 1>or have the final say in how it should</v>
<v Speaker 1>be prepared,</v>

92
00:06:26.990 --> 00:06:30.610
<v Speaker 1>hold a sense of power over others.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so did we.</v>

93
00:06:30.611 --> 00:06:34.430
<v Speaker 1>Zenes of entire countries can come to be</v>
<v Speaker 1>the objects of a bitter and at times</v>

94
00:06:34.431 --> 00:06:37.010
<v Speaker 1>hilarious rivalry.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Similarly,</v>

95
00:06:37.011 --> 00:06:39.810
<v Speaker 1>an over abundant fees can shoot agreed</v>
<v Speaker 1>and hypocrisy.</v>

96
00:06:39.811 --> 00:06:41.750
<v Speaker 1>UV,</v>
<v Speaker 1>tyrannical government and the</v>

97
00:06:41.751 --> 00:06:45.560
<v Speaker 1>meticulously crafted dessert can be used</v>
<v Speaker 1>to reveal the roofless and unpredictable</v>

98
00:06:45.561 --> 00:06:48.890
<v Speaker 1>nature of a character who likes to hide</v>
<v Speaker 1>behind a gentle masco.</v>

99
00:06:48.900 --> 00:06:51.770
<v Speaker 1>Be civilized friend.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Send the deposit</v>

100
00:06:52.070 --> 00:06:56.270
<v Speaker 2>doctor</v>
<v Speaker 2>I said are totally booked to it.</v>

101
00:06:56.271 --> 00:06:57.260
<v Speaker 2>Nine.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Perfect.</v>

102
00:06:57.530 --> 00:06:58.363
<v Speaker 2>See you then.</v>

103
00:06:58.770 --> 00:07:03.150
<v Speaker 1>Food is a status symbol we can use to</v>
<v Speaker 1>impress others with and you Seville our</v>

104
00:07:03.151 --> 00:07:04.440
<v Speaker 1>own real personality.</v>

105
00:07:04.840 --> 00:07:07.070
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have to promote general social</v>

106
00:07:07.090 --> 00:07:07.923
<v Speaker 2>concern.</v>

107
00:07:08.540 --> 00:07:11.810
<v Speaker 1>It's a symbol through which we can gauge</v>
<v Speaker 1>the matter of control a character has</v>

108
00:07:11.811 --> 00:07:15.440
<v Speaker 1>over his life and it means through which</v>
<v Speaker 1>to maintain an artificial sense of</v>

109
00:07:15.441 --> 00:07:20.270
<v Speaker 1>civility juxtaposed against a contrast.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In reality you'll be character or of the</v>

110
00:07:20.271 --> 00:07:21.230
<v Speaker 1>outside world.</v>

111
00:07:21.550 --> 00:07:26.550
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we made it dude,</v>

112
00:07:31.410 --> 00:07:33.300
<v Speaker 1>but just as cooked food can height</v>
<v Speaker 1>faults,</v>

113
00:07:33.301 --> 00:07:37.080
<v Speaker 1>any person or society.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It can also serve as a symbol of freedom</v>

114
00:07:37.081 --> 00:07:40.110
<v Speaker 1>and hope.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's going daddy cooking and</v>

115
00:07:40.111 --> 00:07:42.690
<v Speaker 1>cooked food as civilized.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's can be used to bring people</v>

116
00:07:42.691 --> 00:07:44.820
<v Speaker 1>together.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know the thing about good food.</v>

117
00:07:45.690 --> 00:07:48.390
<v Speaker 1>It brings folks together from all walks</v>
<v Speaker 1>of life.</v>

118
00:07:48.800 --> 00:07:51.330
<v Speaker 1>We had our people with wildly varying</v>
<v Speaker 1>personalities,</v>

119
00:07:51.331 --> 00:07:54.870
<v Speaker 1>sculpture or even those in an active</v>
<v Speaker 1>state of war II,</v>

120
00:07:54.871 --> 00:07:58.140
<v Speaker 1>belly well filled functions as one of</v>
<v Speaker 1>the prime factors in creating a</v>

121
00:07:58.141 --> 00:08:03.141
<v Speaker 1>civilized environment.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It is perhaps no wonder then that we've</v>

122
00:08:03.151 --> 00:08:04.980
<v Speaker 1>chosen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The dinner table is one of the prime</v>

123
00:08:04.981 --> 00:08:08.100
<v Speaker 1>places from where intimate relationships</v>
<v Speaker 1>can grow and bloom.</v>

124
00:08:08.460 --> 00:08:09.293
<v Speaker 1>Now you'll know</v>

125
00:08:10.500 --> 00:08:13.040
<v Speaker 2>do we eat?</v>
<v Speaker 2>The good food is to be close to God,</v>

126
00:08:14.010 --> 00:08:16.650
<v Speaker 1>meticulously cooked food like an</v>
<v Speaker 1>exceptional book.</v>

127
00:08:16.680 --> 00:08:20.940
<v Speaker 1>A painting or a great piece of cinema</v>
<v Speaker 1>can have a transformative effect on</v>

128
00:08:20.941 --> 00:08:25.941
<v Speaker 1>characters and people alike.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Bringing back memories this instantly</v>

129
00:08:27.500 --> 00:08:31.650
<v Speaker 1>and brings you back to my time and</v>
<v Speaker 1>taking our breaths away in a moment of</v>

130
00:08:31.651 --> 00:08:32.580
<v Speaker 1>peaceful bliss.</v>

131
00:08:42.980 --> 00:08:45.580
<v Speaker 2>It's so fucking good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I should kill you.</v>

132
00:08:49.800 --> 00:08:53.950
<v Speaker 1>And Cinema as well as in the real world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Cooking and cooked food reveal their</v>

133
00:08:53.960 --> 00:08:56.940
<v Speaker 1>connectedness with argument.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He by making dose who engage in it,</v>

134
00:08:56.941 --> 00:08:59.850
<v Speaker 1>more human,</v>
<v Speaker 1>bringing us closer to ourselves and we</v>

135
00:08:59.851 --> 00:09:04.851
<v Speaker 1>can link old passions and relationships.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This uniquely human trait has gone hand</v>

136
00:09:05.641 --> 00:09:09.300
<v Speaker 1>in hand with the evolution of our</v>
<v Speaker 1>species from a wild group of primates</v>

137
00:09:09.330 --> 00:09:13.710
<v Speaker 1>and two cultured civilizations who owe a</v>
<v Speaker 1>great deal to the very first chefs of</v>

138
00:09:13.711 --> 00:09:17.670
<v Speaker 1>our race for filmmakers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The interest and usage of cooking and</v>

139
00:09:17.671 --> 00:09:22.500
<v Speaker 1>food and film is and perhaps ought to be</v>
<v Speaker 1>not just limited to an allegory about</v>

140
00:09:22.501 --> 00:09:25.530
<v Speaker 1>the frustrations of art,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's about cooked food as one of the</v>

141
00:09:25.531 --> 00:09:30.531
<v Speaker 1>main civilizing drives of our species</v>
<v Speaker 1>because the food we eat in our daily</v>

142
00:09:30.691 --> 00:09:35.490
<v Speaker 1>lives and especially to food characters,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Cook and consume and movies is in a lot</v>

143
00:09:35.491 --> 00:09:39.300
<v Speaker 1>of ways universally connected to the</v>
<v Speaker 1>overarching topics of all story,</v>

144
00:09:39.810 --> 00:09:42.450
<v Speaker 1>who we are as people and what it means</v>
<v Speaker 1>to be human.</v>

145
00:09:51.430 --> 00:09:52.263
