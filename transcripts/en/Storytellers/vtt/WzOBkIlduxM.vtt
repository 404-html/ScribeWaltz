<v Speaker 1>Thank you to audible for sponsoring this</v>
<v Speaker 1>video.</v>

2
00:00:08.200 --> 00:00:09.450
<v Speaker 2>Guys,</v>

3
00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:19.060
<v Speaker 3>early in May,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the German offensive began along the</v>

4
00:00:19.061 --> 00:00:21.450
<v Speaker 3>front extending from course the prime</v>
<v Speaker 3>area.</v>

5
00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:35.250
<v Speaker 3>More of the world was afraid.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Russian campaigns have been smaller,</v>

6
00:00:35.251 --> 00:00:37.660
<v Speaker 3>but Germans were the span threshold</v>
<v Speaker 3>would</v>

7
00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:44.160
<v Speaker 3>still fail to simultaneous attacks from</v>
<v Speaker 3>the north,</v>

8
00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:48.650
<v Speaker 3>from the south</v>
<v Speaker 3>was tussled with the banks.</v>

9
00:00:50.220 --> 00:00:52.530
<v Speaker 3>We're getting castle instead of the</v>
<v Speaker 3>Russians</v>

10
00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:59.130
<v Speaker 3>are not only a field barney,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he lost his firearm.</v>

11
00:01:00.060 --> 00:01:04.900
<v Speaker 3>One million,</v>
<v Speaker 3>one hundred ninety three thousand five</v>

12
00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:07.320
<v Speaker 3>hundred twenty five million,</v>
<v Speaker 3>800,000.</v>

13
00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:25.100
<v Speaker 4>I just</v>
<v Speaker 4>wanted him because he looked get it,</v>

14
00:01:27.370 --> 00:01:28.800
<v Speaker 4>but she wouldn't be tufted veal.</v>

15
00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:57.410
<v Speaker 1>This is the story of Stalingrad.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is a story of Stalingrad.</v>

16
00:01:57.950 --> 00:02:02.810
<v Speaker 1>This is the story of Stalingrad,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the story of honorable but naive German</v>

17
00:02:02.811 --> 00:02:05.660
<v Speaker 1>men.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The story of the Soviet fighting spirit</v>

18
00:02:05.661 --> 00:02:09.770
<v Speaker 1>against a brutal enemy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the story of the victims of a regime</v>

19
00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:13.940
<v Speaker 1>during the heroes of their country.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The sort of conflicting stories of</v>

20
00:02:13.941 --> 00:02:14.774
<v Speaker 1>Stalingrad</v>

21
00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:29.800
<v Speaker 4>eat mgm and what is that you've asked</v>
<v Speaker 4>them in Manhattan,</v>

22
00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:39.420
<v Speaker 4>is a charging through the heart of the</v>
<v Speaker 4>Soviet Union towards the oil fields of</v>

23
00:02:39.421 --> 00:02:42.690
<v Speaker 4>Asia.</v>
<v Speaker 4>One last obstacle remains.</v>

24
00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:48.520
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>My</v>

25
00:03:24.990 --> 00:03:29.990
<v Speaker 4>vehicle,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which</v>

26
00:03:46.710 --> 00:03:48.710
<v Speaker 4>may</v>
<v Speaker 4>decide</v>

27
00:03:50.510 --> 00:03:52.810
<v Speaker 4>to</v>
<v Speaker 4>get</v>

28
00:03:55.090 --> 00:03:59.030
<v Speaker 4>it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>hopefully</v>

29
00:04:48.400 --> 00:04:51.100
<v Speaker 4>I'm annoyed with Sasha for not staying</v>
<v Speaker 4>at home,</v>

30
00:04:51.101 --> 00:04:56.101
<v Speaker 4>has it made you swear to do it?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm going to have to do,</v>

31
00:05:43.770 --> 00:05:48.770
<v Speaker 4>which</v>
<v Speaker 4>is kind of minded.</v>

32
00:05:56.090 --> 00:06:01.090
<v Speaker 4>She's making these cleansing plans</v>
<v Speaker 4>to have him come on and</v>

33
00:06:08.400 --> 00:06:13.000
<v Speaker 4>try</v>
<v Speaker 4>when you show them</v>

34
00:06:16.480 --> 00:06:21.470
<v Speaker 4>intake</v>
<v Speaker 4>to called Leonardo,</v>

35
00:06:22.540 --> 00:06:27.540
<v Speaker 4>we should trust the instate</v>
<v Speaker 4>managed to lead us to victory.</v>

36
00:06:38.980 --> 00:06:43.980
<v Speaker 4>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 4>whatever</v>

37
00:07:32.810 --> 00:07:37.810
<v Speaker 4>the</v>
<v Speaker 4>city</v>

38
00:07:56.390 --> 00:07:59.660
<v Speaker 4>styling,</v>
<v Speaker 4>styling Grad,</v>

39
00:09:07.860 --> 00:09:12.860
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>
<v Speaker 4>just always happening.</v>

40
00:09:46.870 --> 00:09:50.600
<v Speaker 4>Deport the families of the.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I</v>

41
00:09:52.290 --> 00:09:56.130
<v Speaker 4>have no illusions.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's the learning to socialism in</v>

42
00:09:56.131 --> 00:10:01.131
<v Speaker 4>universal bliss.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Wow.</v>

43
00:10:13.560 --> 00:10:18.560
<v Speaker 4>There's always something to</v>
<v Speaker 4>give it up.</v>

44
00:10:47.330 --> 00:10:50.710
<v Speaker 4>He was under the foot soldier,</v>
<v Speaker 4>wasn't worth giving away my position.</v>

45
00:10:55.140 --> 00:11:00.140
<v Speaker 4>Did we just see the dealership</v>
<v Speaker 4>to</v>

46
00:11:24.830 --> 00:11:29.000
<v Speaker 1>the battle of Stalingrad remains such an</v>
<v Speaker 1>ideologically charged and symbolically</v>

47
00:11:29.001 --> 00:11:32.990
<v Speaker 1>important subject that the last word</v>
<v Speaker 1>will not be heard for many years,</v>

48
00:11:33.230 --> 00:11:37.040
<v Speaker 1>and therefore the story of Stalingrad is</v>
<v Speaker 1>to German story of coping with the</v>

49
00:11:37.041 --> 00:11:40.850
<v Speaker 1>darkest chapter in its history.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Attempting to redeem a disgrace</v>

50
00:11:40.851 --> 00:11:44.570
<v Speaker 1>generation by putting the burden of</v>
<v Speaker 1>guilt on those in a position of power.</v>

51
00:11:45.170 --> 00:11:48.710
<v Speaker 1>It's the Russian memory of the patriotic</v>
<v Speaker 1>war against a brutal enemy.</v>

52
00:11:48.920 --> 00:11:51.170
<v Speaker 1>His statement for to resolve with the</v>
<v Speaker 1>Red Army,</v>

53
00:11:51.500 --> 00:11:55.330
<v Speaker 1>but it's also the western Narrative</v>
<v Speaker 1>Stalin Grad as a struggle for markable</v>

54
00:11:55.331 --> 00:11:58.540
<v Speaker 1>victims,</v>
<v Speaker 1>caught in between two murderous regimes,</v>

55
00:11:59.060 --> 00:12:02.410
<v Speaker 1>more so than actually capturing the</v>
<v Speaker 1>history of or attempting to portray</v>

56
00:12:02.560 --> 00:12:05.200
<v Speaker 1>these narratives.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Leave us with a broad variety of</v>

57
00:12:05.201 --> 00:12:09.460
<v Speaker 1>symbolic perspectives on the battle</v>
<v Speaker 1>perspectives that reveal how to involve</v>

58
00:12:09.461 --> 00:12:11.620
<v Speaker 1>countries,</v>
<v Speaker 1>choose to understand their past,</v>

59
00:12:12.010 --> 00:12:16.510
<v Speaker 1>showcasing the subjectivity inherent in</v>
<v Speaker 1>our perception of history and now did</v>

60
00:12:16.511 --> 00:12:19.570
<v Speaker 1>our post memory of the war is becoming</v>
<v Speaker 1>increasingly reliant,</v>

61
00:12:19.600 --> 00:12:21.490
<v Speaker 1>unmediated images of the past.</v>

62
00:12:21.760 --> 00:12:26.350
<v Speaker 1>The question that arises then is to what</v>
<v Speaker 1>degree evil or cinema and our media both</v>

63
00:12:26.351 --> 00:12:31.210
<v Speaker 1>consciously and unconsciously influence</v>
<v Speaker 1>and perhaps reshape how we come to view</v>

64
00:12:31.211 --> 00:12:33.940
<v Speaker 1>to war in the best in general through</v>
<v Speaker 1>day,</v>

65
00:12:33.941 --> 00:12:38.290
<v Speaker 1>broaden our perspective and help keep</v>
<v Speaker 1>the history alive or are they bound to</v>

66
00:12:38.291 --> 00:12:42.040
<v Speaker 1>distort and revise the actual history in</v>
<v Speaker 1>the minds of the viewer.</v>

67
00:12:42.700 --> 00:12:45.070
<v Speaker 1>Whatever your opinion on the matter may</v>
<v Speaker 1>be.</v>

68
00:12:45.220 --> 00:12:48.390
<v Speaker 1>The film's about styling garage.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Showcase how both filmmakers,</v>

69
00:12:48.400 --> 00:12:50.620
<v Speaker 1>storytellers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and audiences alike.</v>

70
00:12:50.770 --> 00:12:53.860
<v Speaker 1>Shoot at the very least,</v>
<v Speaker 1>be aware of the implications of boasts</v>

71
00:12:53.861 --> 00:12:56.380
<v Speaker 1>memory.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Constructed through two perspectives of</v>

72
00:12:56.381 --> 00:13:00.880
<v Speaker 1>works of fiction and to be mindful of</v>
<v Speaker 1>what we're trying to say and what we're</v>

73
00:13:00.881 --> 00:13:02.470
<v Speaker 1>being shown about our history.</v>
