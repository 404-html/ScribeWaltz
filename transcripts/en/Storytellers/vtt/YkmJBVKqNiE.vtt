1
00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:08.100
<v Speaker 1>The breaking of the fourth wall has been</v>
<v Speaker 1>defined as a character acknowledging the</v>

2
00:00:08.101 --> 00:00:10.800
<v Speaker 1>existence of the audience outside of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>film.</v>

3
00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:14.580
<v Speaker 1>But besides merely recognizing the</v>
<v Speaker 1>existence of the separate reality,</v>

4
00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:17.130
<v Speaker 1>Martin Scorsese,</v>
<v Speaker 1>shutter island actually invites the</v>

5
00:00:17.131 --> 00:00:21.840
<v Speaker 1>audience to completely identify with its</v>
<v Speaker 1>main character by placing the camera</v>

6
00:00:21.870 --> 00:00:25.240
<v Speaker 1>inside a mirror,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a the,</v>

7
00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:27.710
<v Speaker 1>uh.</v>

8
00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:39.570
<v Speaker 1>Now what's remarkable about this shot is</v>
<v Speaker 1>that it helps you clarify why</v>

9
00:00:39.571 --> 00:00:42.930
<v Speaker 1>consecutive viewings of shutter island</v>
<v Speaker 1>changed the experience of the film</v>

10
00:00:42.931 --> 00:00:44.760
<v Speaker 1>completely.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You could even say it at,</v>

11
00:00:44.761 --> 00:00:47.130
<v Speaker 1>it's like you're watching a completely</v>
<v Speaker 1>different film.</v>

12
00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:51.340
<v Speaker 1>We start off by watching and mystery</v>
<v Speaker 1>thriller about you was martial Teddy</v>

13
00:00:51.340 --> 00:00:54.390
<v Speaker 1>Daniels and a search warrant escape</v>
<v Speaker 1>patients from remote Ashlyn mental</v>

14
00:00:54.391 --> 00:00:57.240
<v Speaker 1>institution.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But mostly the story is about his search</v>

15
00:00:57.241 --> 00:01:00.540
<v Speaker 1>for the killer of his wife,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the arsonist and route latus who</v>

16
00:01:00.541 --> 00:01:04.290
<v Speaker 1>supposedly also a patient on the island.</v>
<v Speaker 1>As the story unravels,</v>

17
00:01:04.291 --> 00:01:07.530
<v Speaker 1>we find out that the two marshals</v>
<v Speaker 1>might've become the victim of a blog by</v>

18
00:01:07.531 --> 00:01:11.130
<v Speaker 1>Ashley through sinus and from revealing</v>
<v Speaker 1>dark secrets about the institution.</v>

19
00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:13.980
<v Speaker 1>And it's only you had to climbing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the story that we discovered a real</v>

20
00:01:13.981 --> 00:01:17.030
<v Speaker 1>truth,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're name is andrew latest.</v>

21
00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:20.130
<v Speaker 1>The 67th patient had dash cliff is you</v>
<v Speaker 1>andrew?</v>

22
00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:26.740
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I suspect most of yours were shocked by</v>

23
00:01:26.741 --> 00:01:29.290
<v Speaker 1>this plot twist and with the evidence</v>
<v Speaker 1>laid out and it's equal,</v>

24
00:01:29.291 --> 00:01:32.050
<v Speaker 1>might have fought and how did I not see</v>
<v Speaker 1>this before?</v>

25
00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:34.860
<v Speaker 1>However,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some people continue to deny teddy's</v>

26
00:01:34.900 --> 00:01:39.850
<v Speaker 1>true identity seeding that Ashlyn is in</v>
<v Speaker 1>fact a sort of of naziesque CIA lab of</v>

27
00:01:39.851 --> 00:01:41.620
<v Speaker 1>some kind.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So clear up some of these</v>

28
00:01:41.621 --> 00:01:44.340
<v Speaker 1>misunderstandings.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I will argue that the fourth wall newer</v>

29
00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:48.280
<v Speaker 1>shot is key to comprehending the truth</v>
<v Speaker 1>behind shutter island and how to fill</v>

30
00:01:48.281 --> 00:01:52.060
<v Speaker 1>manages to make audiences turn a blind</v>
<v Speaker 1>eye towards reality.</v>

31
00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:57.380
<v Speaker 1>Where are the kids?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's important to note that the rector</v>

32
00:01:57.721 --> 00:02:00.940
<v Speaker 1>of Martin Scorsese stated in an</v>
<v Speaker 1>interview that the entire movie takes</v>

33
00:02:00.941 --> 00:02:04.420
<v Speaker 1>place inside of Teddy's head.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Notice that there's not a single scene</v>

34
00:02:04.421 --> 00:02:08.140
<v Speaker 1>that doesn't depict teddy as the focal</v>
<v Speaker 1>point of the story or even as seen</v>

35
00:02:08.141 --> 00:02:10.690
<v Speaker 1>without his mere presence.</v>
<v Speaker 1>On top of that,</v>

36
00:02:10.691 --> 00:02:14.710
<v Speaker 1>the audience is constantly reminded of</v>
<v Speaker 1>the tragic goodness of Andrew's made up.</v>

37
00:02:14.711 --> 00:02:15.330
<v Speaker 1>Karen.</v>

38
00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:17.970
<v Speaker 2>None an exactly square with teddy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Danielle's the man,</v>

39
00:02:17.971 --> 00:02:19.230
<v Speaker 2>the legend that give you that</v>

40
00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:23.240
<v Speaker 1>Teddy's profession as a US marshall and</v>
<v Speaker 1>his role as protector of justice also</v>

41
00:02:23.241 --> 00:02:27.770
<v Speaker 1>give his character superiority over to</v>
<v Speaker 1>seemingly untrustworthy doctors of ash</v>

42
00:02:27.771 --> 00:02:29.720
<v Speaker 1>cliff,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and if that wasn't enough for the</v>

43
00:02:29.721 --> 00:02:33.470
<v Speaker 1>audience to aligned with Teddy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's also revealed to be a war hero</v>

44
00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:37.280
<v Speaker 1>having liberated victims of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>Holocaust from a Nazi concentration camp</v>

45
00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:39.290
<v Speaker 1>and from the get go.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It is obvious what's Teddy's</v>

46
00:02:39.291 --> 00:02:41.810
<v Speaker 1>preconceptions about the Asheville if</v>
<v Speaker 1>institution are</v>

47
00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:44.390
<v Speaker 3>same,</v>
<v Speaker 3>something like that before.</v>

48
00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:48.680
<v Speaker 1>Both the framing and a dramatic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>almost menacing music playing in the</v>

49
00:02:48.681 --> 00:02:52.940
<v Speaker 1>background attitude unparalleled at this</v>
<v Speaker 1>facility might not be any less evil than</v>

50
00:02:52.941 --> 00:02:56.900
<v Speaker 1>the infamous Nazi death camps.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a real tragedy about his characters</v>

51
00:02:56.901 --> 00:03:00.610
<v Speaker 1>that he cannot come to terms with the</v>
<v Speaker 1>death of his and suffers from a massive</v>

52
00:03:00.611 --> 00:03:04.300
<v Speaker 1>amount of guilt for having executed a</v>
<v Speaker 1>number of cam guards during the war.</v>

53
00:03:04.960 --> 00:03:09.130
<v Speaker 1>Teddy's really shown to be a victim</v>
<v Speaker 1>rather than a perpetrator and all of</v>

54
00:03:09.131 --> 00:03:12.790
<v Speaker 1>this really makes it difficult for the</v>
<v Speaker 1>audience not to fully aligned with the</v>

55
00:03:12.791 --> 00:03:17.791
<v Speaker 1>protagonist and really end up being just</v>
<v Speaker 1>as delusional as the main character</v>

56
00:03:17.861 --> 00:03:18.694
<v Speaker 1>himself.</v>

57
00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:24.130
<v Speaker 1>Andrew,</v>
<v Speaker 1>please do.</v>

58
00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:27.280
<v Speaker 1>However,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even during the first viewing of the</v>

59
00:03:27.281 --> 00:03:29.360
<v Speaker 1>film,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can already notice that Teddy's</v>

60
00:03:29.380 --> 00:03:33.430
<v Speaker 1>world is a little strange.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Many of the characters don't really seem</v>

61
00:03:33.431 --> 00:03:36.730
<v Speaker 1>to act as one would expect them to in</v>
<v Speaker 1>certain situations.</v>

62
00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:40.990
<v Speaker 1>The guards seem to be irrationally on</v>
<v Speaker 1>Agis steadying chuck arrive and that's</v>

63
00:03:40.991 --> 00:03:42.790
<v Speaker 1>supposedly because of the escape</v>
<v Speaker 1>patient,</v>

64
00:03:43.150 --> 00:03:44.870
<v Speaker 1>but later shown to be bored.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When ted,</v>

65
00:03:44.871 --> 00:03:46.990
<v Speaker 1>he launches a search party on the</v>
<v Speaker 1>island.</v>

66
00:03:47.320 --> 00:03:49.030
<v Speaker 1>Patients are waving and looking at</v>
<v Speaker 1>setting,</v>

67
00:03:49.050 --> 00:03:52.750
<v Speaker 1>but not a chuck and doctors and nurses</v>
<v Speaker 1>are kind of laughing at Teddy's attempts</v>

68
00:03:52.751 --> 00:03:57.070
<v Speaker 1>to interviewed him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Very impression defense mechanisms.</v>

69
00:03:57.280 --> 00:04:01.030
<v Speaker 1>Even chuck eggs out of character as he</v>
<v Speaker 1>struggles to get his firearm out of his</v>

70
00:04:01.031 --> 00:04:03.490
<v Speaker 1>belt.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just seems like an odd thing to happen</v>

71
00:04:03.491 --> 00:04:05.710
<v Speaker 1>to you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>As Marshall and especially for film,</v>

72
00:04:05.860 --> 00:04:10.060
<v Speaker 1>it's a bit emphasis on such a subtle and</v>
<v Speaker 1>arguably insignificant occurrence and</v>

73
00:04:10.070 --> 00:04:13.990
<v Speaker 1>even said he shows irrational behavior</v>
<v Speaker 1>as he starts to act on impulse and</v>

74
00:04:13.991 --> 00:04:18.100
<v Speaker 1>becomes increasingly violent and</v>
<v Speaker 1>reckless in a search for a man who looks</v>

75
00:04:18.101 --> 00:04:20.260
<v Speaker 1>almost too fantastical to be real.</v>

76
00:04:20.740 --> 00:04:23.590
<v Speaker 1>Then there's the fact that the film has</v>
<v Speaker 1>a number of continuity errors that are</v>

77
00:04:23.591 --> 00:04:27.000
<v Speaker 1>so obvious that they kind of possibly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you haven't missed buddy editor on</v>

78
00:04:27.020 --> 00:04:28.540
<v Speaker 1>accident.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In one scene,</v>

79
00:04:28.541 --> 00:04:32.350
<v Speaker 1>the character pretends to drink water</v>
<v Speaker 1>out of a nonexisting glass only for the</v>

80
00:04:32.351 --> 00:04:34.660
<v Speaker 1>glass,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so your peer empty in the next shot.</v>

81
00:04:35.140 --> 00:04:38.450
<v Speaker 1>These jump cuts enhance the feeling that</v>
<v Speaker 1>said he's living in a sort of dreamlike</v>

82
00:04:38.470 --> 00:04:40.590
<v Speaker 1>state.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hence why both the character and</v>

83
00:04:40.610 --> 00:04:43.900
<v Speaker 1>audience start to question the realness</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the protagonists world.</v>

84
00:04:44.110 --> 00:04:46.390
<v Speaker 1>However,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all of this can still be explained with</v>

85
00:04:46.391 --> 00:04:47.590
<v Speaker 1>the argument.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the entire thing.</v>

86
00:04:47.591 --> 00:04:50.800
<v Speaker 1>It was just a set up and said he was</v>
<v Speaker 1>just being drugged and manipulated into</v>

87
00:04:50.801 --> 00:04:53.830
<v Speaker 1>believing that he is in fact the</v>
<v Speaker 1>perpetrator himself.</v>

88
00:04:54.190 --> 00:04:55.060
<v Speaker 1>Why are you here?</v>

89
00:04:59.420 --> 00:05:03.590
<v Speaker 1>I killed my wife.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now there's really one scene or rather</v>

90
00:05:03.640 --> 00:05:07.800
<v Speaker 1>one musical piece that quite subtly</v>
<v Speaker 1>manages to debunk this train of thought</v>

91
00:05:08.250 --> 00:05:10.950
<v Speaker 1>called tip top caroline and string.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It ain't mine.</v>

92
00:05:11.280 --> 00:05:14.040
<v Speaker 1>Besides the fact that the music</v>
<v Speaker 1>parallels the general feeling of the</v>

93
00:05:14.041 --> 00:05:16.320
<v Speaker 1>scene.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Courtside for strings and piano and a</v>

94
00:05:16.321 --> 00:05:20.490
<v Speaker 1>minor by Gustav Mahler remains a rat or</v>
<v Speaker 1>odd choice of music to say the least</v>

95
00:05:20.580 --> 00:05:23.490
<v Speaker 1>receipt at the music triggers a response</v>
<v Speaker 1>in Teddy to brings him back to the</v>

96
00:05:23.491 --> 00:05:25.650
<v Speaker 1>headquarters with the Dachau</v>
<v Speaker 1>concentration camp.</v>

97
00:05:25.651 --> 00:05:27.720
<v Speaker 1>We're just seeing music was playing on a</v>
<v Speaker 1>record player.</v>

98
00:05:28.170 --> 00:05:32.430
<v Speaker 1>Now why is this odd?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because Khrushchev Mahler was Jewish and</v>

99
00:05:32.431 --> 00:05:34.680
<v Speaker 1>his music was subsequently banned by the</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nazis.</v>

100
00:05:34.860 --> 00:05:37.440
<v Speaker 1>Secondly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the quartet for strings belongs to malls</v>

101
00:05:37.470 --> 00:05:41.100
<v Speaker 1>earlier and lesser known work.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So why on earth would a s s chem water</v>

102
00:05:41.101 --> 00:05:43.590
<v Speaker 1>and a half this exact piece playing in</v>
<v Speaker 1>his headquarters?</v>

103
00:05:43.850 --> 00:05:47.610
<v Speaker 1>It seems highly unlikely that this event</v>
<v Speaker 1>actually happened and it makes us wonder</v>

104
00:05:47.611 --> 00:05:51.720
<v Speaker 1>about the reality of Teddy's memories.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The music adds a sort of grimm brothers'</v>

105
00:05:51.721 --> 00:05:53.820
<v Speaker 1>fairy till like quality to the memory.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

106
00:05:53.821 --> 00:05:56.940
<v Speaker 1>snow was falling everywhere and bodies</v>
<v Speaker 1>life frozen on the ground.</v>

107
00:05:57.410 --> 00:06:01.220
<v Speaker 1>The thing is real life footage shows</v>
<v Speaker 1>that there was no real snow to be seen</v>

108
00:06:01.221 --> 00:06:04.910
<v Speaker 1>during the liberation of the camp.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Adding further doubt about just how</v>

109
00:06:04.911 --> 00:06:09.030
<v Speaker 1>trustworthy you teddy's perspective is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A little research also reveals the</v>

110
00:06:09.031 --> 00:06:13.310
<v Speaker 1>Mahler actually never finished a quartet</v>
<v Speaker 1>and had trouble finding his own voice</v>

111
00:06:13.340 --> 00:06:15.920
<v Speaker 1>leaving in fragmented and isolated in</v>
<v Speaker 1>between his work.</v>

112
00:06:16.070 --> 00:06:20.480
<v Speaker 1>The parallel of Andrew Dan seems obvious</v>
<v Speaker 1>as he struggles to find his own voice</v>

113
00:06:20.481 --> 00:06:23.810
<v Speaker 1>and hides behind the voice of Teddy</v>
<v Speaker 1>taking the ferry back in the morning,</v>

114
00:06:24.650 --> 00:06:27.800
<v Speaker 1>come on show,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and to prove that Andrew is in fact</v>

115
00:06:27.801 --> 00:06:29.360
<v Speaker 1>hiding behind this fake persona.</v>

116
00:06:29.360 --> 00:06:31.910
<v Speaker 1>We only have to look at the opening</v>
<v Speaker 1>scene of the movie.</v>

117
00:06:32.090 --> 00:06:34.040
<v Speaker 1>After Teddy froze up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he looks into the mirror,</v>

118
00:06:34.070 --> 00:06:37.790
<v Speaker 1>which in film often indicates that the</v>
<v Speaker 1>character has a split personality on top</v>

119
00:06:37.791 --> 00:06:39.320
<v Speaker 1>of that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you can see that half of this phase</v>

120
00:06:39.321 --> 00:06:41.900
<v Speaker 1>is illuminated by the sun,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whereas the other half is left in the</v>

121
00:06:41.901 --> 00:06:43.970
<v Speaker 1>dark,</v>
<v Speaker 1>signifying teddy's buried real</v>

122
00:06:43.971 --> 00:06:47.060
<v Speaker 1>personality even unknowingly states his</v>
<v Speaker 1>main goals,</v>

123
00:06:47.061 --> 00:06:51.150
<v Speaker 1>the entire story.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This theme returns multiple times and</v>

124
00:06:51.160 --> 00:06:54.770
<v Speaker 1>comes to climates when Andrew's face</v>
<v Speaker 1>fully illuminated and is finally</v>

125
00:06:54.771 --> 00:06:57.650
<v Speaker 1>accepted reality as it is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Or when did you notice that little</v>

126
00:06:57.651 --> 00:07:00.980
<v Speaker 1>bandaid on his forehead?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now that's gone here to indicating that</v>

127
00:07:00.981 --> 00:07:03.500
<v Speaker 1>he is no longer covering up his wounded</v>
<v Speaker 1>personality.</v>

128
00:07:03.800 --> 00:07:05.180
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I remember that part where chuck is</v>

129
00:07:05.181 --> 00:07:09.920
<v Speaker 1>praising Daddy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Notice that the legend also explains</v>

130
00:07:09.921 --> 00:07:13.250
<v Speaker 1>that Teddy's personality is not real,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but just a made up story.</v>

131
00:07:13.370 --> 00:07:16.910
<v Speaker 1>But the most important theme of all to</v>
<v Speaker 1>be found in the opening scene is a</v>

132
00:07:16.911 --> 00:07:20.700
<v Speaker 1>substance that both literally and</v>
<v Speaker 1>figuratively keeps us seen a float</v>

133
00:07:21.020 --> 00:07:23.270
<v Speaker 1>water.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So at the end of the story is revealed</v>

134
00:07:23.271 --> 00:07:25.870
<v Speaker 1>at Andrew's wife drown to children in</v>
<v Speaker 1>the lake and it's wide.</v>

135
00:07:25.880 --> 00:07:29.930
<v Speaker 1>Teddy's so nauseated by water and like</v>
<v Speaker 1>psychological practice steady.</v>

136
00:07:29.931 --> 00:07:33.560
<v Speaker 1>You're slowly but surely put an</v>
<v Speaker 1>increasing contact with water until he</v>

137
00:07:33.561 --> 00:07:37.460
<v Speaker 1>ultimately comes as close to a strauma</v>
<v Speaker 1>as possible by diving into the sea.</v>

138
00:07:37.700 --> 00:07:41.090
<v Speaker 1>But Teddy's physical appearance and</v>
<v Speaker 1>demeanor also changed dramatically</v>

139
00:07:41.091 --> 00:07:43.280
<v Speaker 1>during the film.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He starts his journey with a rat or</v>

140
00:07:43.281 --> 00:07:45.860
<v Speaker 1>collected and no nonsense attitude</v>
<v Speaker 1>towards the world.</v>

141
00:07:46.010 --> 00:07:48.680
<v Speaker 1>But as the story progressed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as he slowly stripped from the things</v>

142
00:07:48.681 --> 00:07:52.130
<v Speaker 1>that make him who he is versus gun,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then his clothes,</v>

143
00:07:52.260 --> 00:07:55.400
<v Speaker 1>then his attitude and ultimately his</v>
<v Speaker 1>entire made up self.</v>

144
00:07:55.550 --> 00:07:58.160
<v Speaker 1>As I stated earlier,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Andrew came up with Teddy's persona only</v>

145
00:07:58.161 --> 00:08:01.370
<v Speaker 1>because he was unable to deal with the</v>
<v Speaker 1>violence and guilt that he's had to</v>

146
00:08:01.371 --> 00:08:06.371
<v Speaker 1>endure in his life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This sort of cyclical nature of violence</v>

147
00:08:07.281 --> 00:08:11.240
<v Speaker 1>and cruelty that is part of humanity and</v>
<v Speaker 1>in which he actively pursue because what</v>

148
00:08:11.241 --> 00:08:16.241
<v Speaker 1>ultimately drove andrew into insanity,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no matter how much he denies it away.</v>

149
00:08:16.700 --> 00:08:18.920
<v Speaker 1>Thanks for harmless,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you can be controlled,</v>

150
00:08:18.921 --> 00:08:19.754
<v Speaker 1>but I know,</v>

151
00:08:22.640 --> 00:08:23.473
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

152
00:08:26.500 --> 00:08:28.000
<v Speaker 4>we've known each other for centuries.</v>

153
00:08:29.180 --> 00:08:33.570
<v Speaker 1>I also notice that the sadistic water</v>
<v Speaker 1>isn't named on purpose because wharton</v>

154
00:08:33.720 --> 00:08:38.610
<v Speaker 1>is an Anagram for Andrew and there are</v>
<v Speaker 1>more of these anagrams to be found as is</v>

155
00:08:38.611 --> 00:08:40.980
<v Speaker 1>shown by Dr Kali at the climax of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>story,</v>

156
00:08:41.160 --> 00:08:42.810
<v Speaker 1>don't we?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Phil Sue explained to name of Teddy's</v>

157
00:08:42.811 --> 00:08:45.960
<v Speaker 1>faith partner chuck all who turns out</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's speed mysterious.</v>

158
00:08:45.961 --> 00:08:48.480
<v Speaker 1>Dr Nian couldn't tell the US Marshall's</v>
<v Speaker 1>office,</v>

159
00:08:48.500 --> 00:08:52.110
<v Speaker 1>but that he's a defense mechanism.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Surprise mother fucker because</v>

160
00:08:52.111 --> 00:08:55.080
<v Speaker 1>fanatically chuck all sounds a lot like</v>
<v Speaker 1>chuckle,</v>

161
00:08:55.560 --> 00:08:58.490
<v Speaker 1>which in turn indicates his character's</v>
<v Speaker 1>rule is jester or trickster.</v>

162
00:08:58.500 --> 00:09:01.830
<v Speaker 1>Within the realm of story as a whole.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The side of companion characters are</v>

163
00:09:01.831 --> 00:09:05.100
<v Speaker 1>known for their miss chief and their</v>
<v Speaker 1>motivation to push to protagonist</v>

164
00:09:05.130 --> 00:09:08.640
<v Speaker 1>interchange and that only does chuck</v>
<v Speaker 1>trick teddy into believing that he is</v>

165
00:09:08.641 --> 00:09:11.190
<v Speaker 1>his partner,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he also has an active interest in</v>

166
00:09:11.191 --> 00:09:14.070
<v Speaker 1>helping Andrew to accept reality as it</v>
<v Speaker 1>is.</v>

167
00:09:14.510 --> 00:09:15.480
<v Speaker 1>Nice.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Makes me one.</v>

168
00:09:17.190 --> 00:09:18.023
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>WHATSAPP,</v>

169
00:09:20.280 --> 00:09:21.270
<v Speaker 1>which would be worse.</v>

170
00:09:23.110 --> 00:09:28.110
<v Speaker 1>Live is a monster and a day is a good</v>
<v Speaker 1>man and to me this is the magic and</v>

171
00:09:29.311 --> 00:09:32.400
<v Speaker 1>brilliance of shutter island.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It knows it's burgers and making the</v>

172
00:09:32.401 --> 00:09:36.480
<v Speaker 1>audience identify fully with a fake</v>
<v Speaker 1>character and arguably manages to make</v>

173
00:09:36.481 --> 00:09:40.410
<v Speaker 1>us just as delusional as Andrew himself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>On top of that,</v>

174
00:09:40.411 --> 00:09:44.060
<v Speaker 1>it gives us a fascinating look into the</v>
<v Speaker 1>psychology of this tragic character</v>

175
00:09:44.070 --> 00:09:48.930
<v Speaker 1>trauma and the nature of reality.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It shows us just how powerful our minds</v>

176
00:09:48.931 --> 00:09:53.600
<v Speaker 1>can be and the perspective really is</v>
<v Speaker 1>everything because when we fully aligned</v>

177
00:09:53.601 --> 00:09:55.530
<v Speaker 1>with the point of view or a certain</v>
<v Speaker 1>belief,</v>

178
00:09:55.800 --> 00:10:00.450
<v Speaker 1>we sometimes feel to see the truth even</v>
<v Speaker 1>if it's laid out right in front of her</v>

179
00:10:00.451 --> 00:10:05.451
<v Speaker 1>eyes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Switch light.</v>

180
00:10:17.200 --> 00:10:18.100
<v Speaker 1>All right.</v>
