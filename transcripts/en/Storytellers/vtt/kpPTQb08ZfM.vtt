1
00:00:02.240 --> 00:00:07.240
<v Speaker 1>Sometimes there was a man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's the man for his time and place.</v>

2
00:00:09.770 --> 00:00:14.770
<v Speaker 1>He fits right in there and that's the</v>
<v Speaker 1>dude in Los Angeles and even if he's a</v>

3
00:00:17.871 --> 00:00:22.871
<v Speaker 1>lazy man and the dude was most certainly</v>
<v Speaker 1>that quite possibly the Las Vegas and</v>

4
00:00:24.231 --> 00:00:28.880
<v Speaker 1>Los Angeles County which would place him</v>
<v Speaker 1>high and are running for laziest</v>

5
00:00:28.881 --> 00:00:32.990
<v Speaker 1>worldwide,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but sometimes there's a man,</v>

6
00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:36.830
<v Speaker 1>sometimes there's a man.</v>

7
00:00:43.870 --> 00:00:48.070
<v Speaker 2>I think many would agree when I say that</v>
<v Speaker 2>the big Lebowski can easily be seen as</v>

8
00:00:48.071 --> 00:00:52.120
<v Speaker 2>one of the greatest cult classics off</v>
<v Speaker 2>our time to film that as inspire</v>

9
00:00:52.121 --> 00:00:56.440
<v Speaker 2>thousands of Halloween costumes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so called Lebowski fest and even a</v>

10
00:00:56.441 --> 00:01:01.090
<v Speaker 2>religion must have received poorly upon</v>
<v Speaker 2>its original release in 1998.</v>

11
00:01:01.510 --> 00:01:05.670
<v Speaker 2>The film was described by critics as</v>
<v Speaker 2>fitbit and spacious.</v>

12
00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:09.760
<v Speaker 2>It was only in the early two thousands</v>
<v Speaker 2>that the film started to get into mess</v>

13
00:01:09.790 --> 00:01:13.570
<v Speaker 2>following and appreciation that made it</v>
<v Speaker 2>the classic that it is today.</v>

14
00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:18.670
<v Speaker 2>It such a steady increasing in</v>
<v Speaker 2>popularity is really intriguing.</v>

15
00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:21.880
<v Speaker 2>Scholars,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Paul Martin and fellow renegot argued</v>

16
00:01:21.881 --> 00:01:26.470
<v Speaker 2>that is jus to a period of economic and</v>
<v Speaker 2>social prosperity in America when the</v>

17
00:01:26.471 --> 00:01:29.950
<v Speaker 2>big Lebowski was released according to</v>
<v Speaker 2>them chew to this,</v>

18
00:01:29.951 --> 00:01:34.030
<v Speaker 2>many Americans weren't as perceptive to</v>
<v Speaker 2>the social critiques that the big</v>

19
00:01:34.031 --> 00:01:36.500
<v Speaker 2>Lebowski could offer.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This changed however,</v>

20
00:01:36.510 --> 00:01:40.000
<v Speaker 2>during the two thousands with impactful</v>
<v Speaker 2>events or 9:11,</v>

21
00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:44.710
<v Speaker 2>the bloody and problematic war in Iraq</v>
<v Speaker 2>and eventually the economic crash of</v>

22
00:01:44.711 --> 00:01:48.010
<v Speaker 2>2008.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then the social and political critique</v>

23
00:01:48.011 --> 00:01:52.480
<v Speaker 2>of the Big Lebowski Fountain audience</v>
<v Speaker 2>and important critique that can be found</v>

24
00:01:52.481 --> 00:01:54.940
<v Speaker 2>in the big Lebowski starts in the</v>
<v Speaker 2>opening scene.</v>

25
00:01:55.540 --> 00:01:59.380
<v Speaker 2>The narrative makes a point of stating</v>
<v Speaker 2>the film takes place during the 1991</v>

26
00:01:59.410 --> 00:02:02.950
<v Speaker 2>Gulf War and that the dudes is just the</v>
<v Speaker 2>man for his time.</v>

27
00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:07.690
<v Speaker 2>The golf course was a time in American</v>
<v Speaker 2>politics where aggression most used as a</v>

28
00:02:07.691 --> 00:02:09.160
<v Speaker 2>means of conflict resolution.</v>

29
00:02:09.230 --> 00:02:13.000
<v Speaker 1>This will not stand.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This will not stand this aggression</v>

30
00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:14.610
<v Speaker 1>against a Kuwait</v>

31
00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:18.420
<v Speaker 2>aggression as a means of conflict.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Resolution is a major theme in the movie</v>

32
00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:22.260
<v Speaker 2>everywhere around two dudes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all the characters to violence and</v>

33
00:02:22.261 --> 00:02:25.530
<v Speaker 2>intimidation to resolve conflicts or</v>
<v Speaker 2>pursue their own interests.</v>

34
00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:32.910
<v Speaker 3>Fucking fascist</v>
<v Speaker 3>Lebowski,</v>

35
00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:39.100
<v Speaker 2>only the dude because he is of course a</v>
<v Speaker 2>pacifist.</v>

36
00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:40.340
<v Speaker 3>These guys,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

37
00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:44.130
<v Speaker 3>good like me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There was a conscientious objector.</v>

38
00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:47.050
<v Speaker 2>It is not a coincidence that the other</v>
<v Speaker 2>Lebowski,</v>

39
00:02:47.051 --> 00:02:50.500
<v Speaker 2>the millionaire who was quite willing to</v>
<v Speaker 2>use aggression and clearly is the</v>

40
00:02:50.501 --> 00:02:55.390
<v Speaker 2>personification of American capitalism.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Remarkably looks like the then Secretary</v>

41
00:02:55.391 --> 00:02:56.890
<v Speaker 2>of Defense,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Dick Cheney,</v>

42
00:02:57.970 --> 00:03:00.790
<v Speaker 2>however it is the dude's friend,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Walter,</v>

43
00:03:00.820 --> 00:03:04.420
<v Speaker 2>who embodies this American policy of</v>
<v Speaker 2>aggression during the Gulf War.</v>

44
00:03:04.990 --> 00:03:07.150
<v Speaker 2>I'm talking about drawing a line in the</v>
<v Speaker 2>sand.</v>

45
00:03:07.151 --> 00:03:08.710
<v Speaker 2>Dude,</v>
<v Speaker 2>across this line,</v>

46
00:03:08.770 --> 00:03:11.910
<v Speaker 2>you do not.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Melissa is constantly set off and users</v>

47
00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:14.650
<v Speaker 2>aggression and intimidation to achieve</v>
<v Speaker 2>his goals.</v>

48
00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:17.930
<v Speaker 4>Just the whole world.</v>
<v Speaker 4>God crazy.</v>

49
00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:23.210
<v Speaker 4>Am I the only one around here?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Just like Jen about the Ra market zero.</v>

50
00:03:23.270 --> 00:03:26.070
<v Speaker 4>They're calling the cops man.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Put the zero</v>

51
00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:31.670
<v Speaker 4>piece of Walter fucking around Taro.</v>

52
00:03:35.590 --> 00:03:39.940
<v Speaker 2>He refers to the goal for when he</v>
<v Speaker 2>criticizes to dude for being a pacifist.</v>

53
00:03:40.270 --> 00:03:43.330
<v Speaker 2>You know that's your answer for</v>
<v Speaker 2>everything and we'll be putting out</v>

54
00:03:43.331 --> 00:03:46.120
<v Speaker 2>something.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Pacifism is not looking at our current</v>

55
00:03:46.121 --> 00:03:48.220
<v Speaker 2>situation with that camel.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Fuck her in a wreck.</v>

56
00:03:48.490 --> 00:03:50.380
<v Speaker 2>Pacifism is not something to hide</v>
<v Speaker 2>behind.</v>

57
00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:52.900
<v Speaker 2>Just take it easy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

58
00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:56.980
<v Speaker 2>I'm perfectly calm.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you could even argue that what he is</v>

59
00:03:56.981 --> 00:04:01.480
<v Speaker 2>yelling in this hilarious scene refers</v>
<v Speaker 2>to Iraq treatment of Kuwait and</v>

60
00:04:01.510 --> 00:04:02.890
<v Speaker 2>Americans reaction to this.</v>

61
00:04:03.220 --> 00:04:05.160
<v Speaker 4>Let's see what happens when he fucking</v>
<v Speaker 4>stranger</v>

62
00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:12.160
<v Speaker 4>Larry Flurry,</v>
<v Speaker 4>flurry.</v>

63
00:04:14.131 --> 00:04:16.420
<v Speaker 4>When you fuck a stranger in the act,</v>

64
00:04:16.630 --> 00:04:20.630
<v Speaker 2>the film is clearly critical of this</v>
<v Speaker 2>means of conflict resolution and this of</v>

65
00:04:20.631 --> 00:04:24.760
<v Speaker 2>the American politics of starting the</v>
<v Speaker 2>Gulf war against Iraq because throughout</v>

66
00:04:24.761 --> 00:04:27.640
<v Speaker 2>the film,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and especially with regards to Walter</v>

67
00:04:27.640 --> 00:04:29.620
<v Speaker 2>Section,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the violence only leads to further</v>

68
00:04:29.621 --> 00:04:31.750
<v Speaker 2>problems,</v>
<v Speaker 2>destruction of their own property,</v>

69
00:04:31.780 --> 00:04:32.980
<v Speaker 2>and even a death.</v>

70
00:04:34.390 --> 00:04:36.320
<v Speaker 4>God,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they shot him.</v>

71
00:04:36.350 --> 00:04:39.880
<v Speaker 4>There</v>
<v Speaker 4>weren't any shots fired.</v>

72
00:04:40.820 --> 00:04:45.340
<v Speaker 4>It's a heart attack</v>
<v Speaker 4>myself,</v>

73
00:04:45.780 --> 00:04:47.090
<v Speaker 4>but I'm pumping blood.</v>
<v Speaker 4>My pants</v>

74
00:04:47.830 --> 00:04:51.080
<v Speaker 2>well kind of course.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Imagine how such a political critique of</v>

75
00:04:51.081 --> 00:04:54.830
<v Speaker 2>American politics of progressions as a</v>
<v Speaker 2>means of conflict resolutions against</v>

76
00:04:54.831 --> 00:04:59.420
<v Speaker 2>Iraq gained popularity in the formations</v>
<v Speaker 2>early two thousands when the highly</v>

77
00:04:59.421 --> 00:05:04.370
<v Speaker 2>criticized second Iraq war started as</v>
<v Speaker 2>Martin and Renner Gar state to both</v>

78
00:05:04.371 --> 00:05:08.780
<v Speaker 2>subtle and explicit commentary.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The Big Lebowski challenges the values</v>

79
00:05:08.781 --> 00:05:13.310
<v Speaker 2>and the dominant national policies of 99</v>
<v Speaker 2>slash one America and celebrates the</v>

80
00:05:13.311 --> 00:05:16.040
<v Speaker 2>qualities of the Common Pacific cystic</v>
<v Speaker 2>citizen.</v>

81
00:05:16.590 --> 00:05:19.340
<v Speaker 2>Yet besides the political critique in</v>
<v Speaker 2>the big Lebowski,</v>

82
00:05:19.341 --> 00:05:22.310
<v Speaker 2>we can also find a broader critique or</v>
<v Speaker 2>society as a whole.</v>

83
00:05:22.730 --> 00:05:26.240
<v Speaker 2>I think that that is from this critique</v>
<v Speaker 2>that we can explain the cultural impact</v>

84
00:05:26.241 --> 00:05:28.400
<v Speaker 2>of the big Lebowski,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the Lebowski fest,</v>

85
00:05:28.460 --> 00:05:32.390
<v Speaker 2>and the religion of Judaism,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which basically preaches going with the</v>

86
00:05:32.391 --> 00:05:36.140
<v Speaker 2>flow and taking it easy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Martin and renegot explained this to</v>

87
00:05:36.141 --> 00:05:39.080
<v Speaker 2>what they call the carnivalesque</v>
<v Speaker 2>qualities of the big Lebowski.</v>

88
00:05:39.710 --> 00:05:42.110
<v Speaker 2>The carnivalesque can be explained in</v>
<v Speaker 2>different ways,</v>

89
00:05:42.111 --> 00:05:47.000
<v Speaker 2>yet it comes down to a way of humor that</v>
<v Speaker 2>seeks to deconstruct and ridicule social</v>

90
00:05:47.001 --> 00:05:48.230
<v Speaker 2>norms,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hierarchies,</v>

91
00:05:48.260 --> 00:05:50.090
<v Speaker 2>and power,</v>
<v Speaker 2>six,</v>

92
00:05:50.180 --> 00:05:53.900
<v Speaker 2>to exposed to artificial construction or</v>
<v Speaker 2>society and makes fun of it.</v>

93
00:05:54.470 --> 00:05:56.450
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the two most important qualities that</v>

94
00:05:56.451 --> 00:06:00.680
<v Speaker 2>marked a kind arco desk realism and</v>
<v Speaker 2>reversal of hierarchies.</v>

95
00:06:01.850 --> 00:06:06.850
<v Speaker 2>Fucking grotesque realism means taking</v>
<v Speaker 2>down and ridiculing everything that is</v>

96
00:06:08.001 --> 00:06:10.010
<v Speaker 2>considered proper aunts.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Respectable.</v>

97
00:06:10.380 --> 00:06:13.610
<v Speaker 2>It is lowering everything that is</v>
<v Speaker 2>considered holy back to the three of</v>

98
00:06:13.640 --> 00:06:18.170
<v Speaker 2>earth and body.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Examples of imagery that are a grotesque</v>

99
00:06:18.171 --> 00:06:21.640
<v Speaker 2>realism are images of bodily functions,</v>
<v Speaker 2>old and fat bodies,</v>

100
00:06:21.641 --> 00:06:22.880
<v Speaker 2>sex,</v>
<v Speaker 2>pregnancy,</v>

101
00:06:22.881 --> 00:06:23.714
<v Speaker 2>and preventing it.</v>

102
00:06:24.320 --> 00:06:29.320
<v Speaker 4>Let me tell you something or you pull</v>
<v Speaker 4>any crazy shit with us.</v>

103
00:06:29.570 --> 00:06:34.570
<v Speaker 4>You flash a piece out on the lanes they</v>
<v Speaker 4>got away from you and stick it up your</v>

104
00:06:35.031 --> 00:06:37.730
<v Speaker 4>ass and pulled the fucking trigger.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Delayed goes,</v>

105
00:06:40.690 --> 00:06:42.800
<v Speaker 4>Jesus.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You said in mind,</v>

106
00:06:43.790 --> 00:06:45.830
<v Speaker 4>nobody fucks with Jesus</v>

107
00:06:48.440 --> 00:06:49.910
<v Speaker 2>in the big Lebowski.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This starts,</v>

108
00:06:49.911 --> 00:06:52.160
<v Speaker 2>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>with the peeing on the rock and the car</v>

109
00:06:52.161 --> 00:06:55.280
<v Speaker 2>that smells like urine,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it is also seen in a buddy's of the</v>

110
00:06:55.281 --> 00:06:58.880
<v Speaker 2>characters in the big Lebowski.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We don't see beautiful movie star</v>

111
00:06:58.881 --> 00:07:00.040
<v Speaker 2>buddies.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Instead,</v>

112
00:07:00.050 --> 00:07:04.190
<v Speaker 2>the camera focuses on overweight middle</v>
<v Speaker 2>age guys with beer bellies and food</v>

113
00:07:04.191 --> 00:07:07.970
<v Speaker 2>stains on my shirt.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It is to this humoristic focus on the</v>

114
00:07:07.971 --> 00:07:10.940
<v Speaker 2>lower above lead that the audience is</v>
<v Speaker 2>asked to look differently at it.</v>

115
00:07:11.450 --> 00:07:12.560
<v Speaker 2>Fucking interesting,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

116
00:07:12.590 --> 00:07:17.590
<v Speaker 2>That's fucking interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Grotesque realism can be seen and</v>

117
00:07:17.641 --> 00:07:20.580
<v Speaker 2>profanity and overtly sexual dialogue as</v>
<v Speaker 2>well.</v>

118
00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:23.880
<v Speaker 2>This is used as a way to break through</v>
<v Speaker 2>social hierarchies.</v>

119
00:07:24.390 --> 00:07:25.560
<v Speaker 2>We can see this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for example,</v>

120
00:07:25.561 --> 00:07:28.200
<v Speaker 2>in math,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who is very aware of how use of language</v>

121
00:07:28.201 --> 00:07:31.320
<v Speaker 2>can break through social convention and</v>
<v Speaker 2>create social power.</v>

122
00:07:31.580 --> 00:07:34.140
<v Speaker 5>My art has been commended as being</v>
<v Speaker 5>strongly vaginal,</v>

123
00:07:34.170 --> 00:07:36.970
<v Speaker 5>which bothers some men.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The word itself makes someone</v>

124
00:07:36.990 --> 00:07:37.823
<v Speaker 5>uncomfortable,</v>

125
00:07:38.860 --> 00:07:41.010
<v Speaker 1>but Jina oh yeah.</v>

126
00:07:41.220 --> 00:07:42.660
<v Speaker 5>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't like hearing it and find it</v>

127
00:07:42.661 --> 00:07:45.730
<v Speaker 5>difficult to say,</v>
<v Speaker 5>whereas without batting an eye man refer</v>

128
00:07:45.731 --> 00:07:50.731
<v Speaker 5>to his dick or his rod or his Johnson</v>
<v Speaker 5>Johnson,</v>

129
00:07:51.610 --> 00:07:52.720
<v Speaker 2>funnily enough,</v>
<v Speaker 2>however,</v>

130
00:07:52.721 --> 00:07:55.960
<v Speaker 2>since the dude is also very unconcerned</v>
<v Speaker 2>with social convention and</v>

131
00:07:55.961 --> 00:07:59.080
<v Speaker 2>respectability,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he is rather and faced a better example,</v>

132
00:07:59.081 --> 00:08:02.380
<v Speaker 2>therefore will be bunny.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She first becomes characterized as a</v>

133
00:08:02.381 --> 00:08:06.370
<v Speaker 2>trophy wife or for rich old millionaire.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A woman in her position is often</v>

134
00:08:06.371 --> 00:08:10.150
<v Speaker 2>expected to serve as elegant ICANDY and</v>
<v Speaker 2>it has a lack of social power,</v>

135
00:08:10.540 --> 00:08:14.380
<v Speaker 2>yet too overtly sexual dialogue.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She breaks to this convention,</v>

136
00:08:14.410 --> 00:08:17.800
<v Speaker 2>the social construction of what is</v>
<v Speaker 2>considered respectable behavior and</v>

137
00:08:17.860 --> 00:08:19.480
<v Speaker 2>gains in a way social power.</v>

138
00:08:21.410 --> 00:08:26.410
<v Speaker 1>Second Wonderful Woman</v>

139
00:08:29.060 --> 00:08:29.920
<v Speaker 4>Rah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Rah,</v>

140
00:08:29.921 --> 00:08:32.130
<v Speaker 4>very fond of are very free spirited</v>
<v Speaker 4>brand.</v>

141
00:08:32.170 --> 00:08:37.030
<v Speaker 4>Can't watch that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's marvelous.</v>

142
00:08:38.920 --> 00:08:42.640
<v Speaker 2>This brings me to the second and most</v>
<v Speaker 2>important feature of the carnivalesque,</v>

143
00:08:42.760 --> 00:08:46.780
<v Speaker 2>the inversion of social hierarchies.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This breaks down hierarchies in society,</v>

144
00:08:46.781 --> 00:08:50.440
<v Speaker 2>but I did the training of rulers and let</v>
<v Speaker 2>alone take their places.</v>

145
00:08:51.130 --> 00:08:53.320
<v Speaker 2>This way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the audience has shown the artificial</v>

146
00:08:53.321 --> 00:08:57.270
<v Speaker 2>nature of these hierarchies and</v>
<v Speaker 2>encouraged to rethink such a system.</v>

147
00:08:57.480 --> 00:09:00.180
<v Speaker 2>We already see this in a dude as the</v>
<v Speaker 2>protagonist.</v>

148
00:09:00.360 --> 00:09:02.130
<v Speaker 2>Instead of the typical American</v>
<v Speaker 2>handsome,</v>

149
00:09:02.131 --> 00:09:05.700
<v Speaker 2>capable of leading men hero,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we get a bathrobe and flip flops wearing</v>

150
00:09:05.730 --> 00:09:09.420
<v Speaker 2>bore bomb who stole to be possibly the</v>
<v Speaker 2>laziest man in the world.</v>

151
00:09:09.540 --> 00:09:11.190
<v Speaker 2>The man for his time and place.</v>

152
00:09:11.630 --> 00:09:16.460
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Just like your opinion,</v>

153
00:09:16.461 --> 00:09:17.110
<v Speaker 6>man.</v>

154
00:09:17.110 --> 00:09:19.190
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's the other Lebowski who is referred</v>

155
00:09:19.191 --> 00:09:23.390
<v Speaker 2>to by the dude as the big Lebowski,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a successful millionaire at the top of</v>

156
00:09:23.391 --> 00:09:28.391
<v Speaker 2>the social ladder who gained his wealth</v>
<v Speaker 2>by supposedly a life part work turns out</v>

157
00:09:28.431 --> 00:09:31.970
<v Speaker 2>to be a total failure in business who</v>
<v Speaker 2>lives off an allowance from the trust of</v>

158
00:09:31.971 --> 00:09:36.971
<v Speaker 2>his deceased spouse and to refer back to</v>
<v Speaker 2>the relevance of the Gulf War and the</v>

159
00:09:36.981 --> 00:09:38.950
<v Speaker 2>dudes dream,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the supposedly fearful,</v>

160
00:09:38.990 --> 00:09:42.230
<v Speaker 2>powerful dictator.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Saddam Hussein is working as a bowling</v>

161
00:09:42.231 --> 00:09:45.320
<v Speaker 2>shoe attendant offering.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The dude that unique pair of silver and</v>

162
00:09:45.321 --> 00:09:50.321
<v Speaker 2>gold bowling shoes is reinforces to do</v>
<v Speaker 2>kidney position and show Saddam Hussein</v>

163
00:09:50.361 --> 00:09:53.450
<v Speaker 2>and the lowly status that's modern and</v>
<v Speaker 2>renegade states,</v>

164
00:09:53.690 --> 00:09:56.900
<v Speaker 2>so such inverted rows.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The audiences enabled to see social</v>

165
00:09:56.901 --> 00:10:01.430
<v Speaker 2>reality as a construct under this</v>
<v Speaker 2>encouraged to question it in the end.</v>

166
00:10:01.490 --> 00:10:03.620
<v Speaker 2>This is one of the key concepts of the</v>
<v Speaker 2>film.</v>

167
00:10:03.830 --> 00:10:08.330
<v Speaker 2>It puts us viewers to be aware of the</v>
<v Speaker 2>constructed nature of society and shows</v>

168
00:10:08.331 --> 00:10:10.370
<v Speaker 2>us we are not obliged to take part in</v>
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>

169
00:10:11.060 --> 00:10:14.290
<v Speaker 2>The dude is living a lifestyle</v>
<v Speaker 2>completely in opposition to Alice,</v>

170
00:10:14.300 --> 00:10:18.710
<v Speaker 2>respectfully seen as the American dream.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yet he is content living by its own</v>

171
00:10:18.711 --> 00:10:21.440
<v Speaker 2>ethics and sense of purpose as he says.</v>

172
00:10:21.520 --> 00:10:22.353
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Well,</v>

173
00:10:26.520 --> 00:10:30.810
<v Speaker 2>the dude abides to construction nature</v>
<v Speaker 2>of society who doesn't conform to it.</v>

174
00:10:31.200 --> 00:10:33.990
<v Speaker 2>Instead,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's out there taking it easy for us all</v>

175
00:10:34.290 --> 00:10:36.180
<v Speaker 2>and invite us to do the same</v>
