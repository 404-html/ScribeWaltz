1
00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:30.380
<v Speaker 1>I think that the story of Simba is an a</v>
<v Speaker 1>typical and mythological story,</v>

2
00:00:30.481 --> 00:00:35.100
<v Speaker 1>not only about the hero's journey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but more importantly about the meaning</v>

3
00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:38.100
<v Speaker 1>of growing up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When Tim was born in the opening of the</v>

4
00:00:38.101 --> 00:00:40.720
<v Speaker 1>film,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he is held up to look out over off</v>

5
00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:43.380
<v Speaker 1>Africa's wildlife who bow down before</v>
<v Speaker 1>him,</v>

6
00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:46.350
<v Speaker 1>freedom him with all respect and</v>
<v Speaker 1>obedience.</v>

7
00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:50.510
<v Speaker 1>From a Freudian perspective,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is a wonderful allegory for Freud's</v>

8
00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:53.010
<v Speaker 1>concept of his majesty,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the baby.</v>

9
00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:56.670
<v Speaker 1>When a child is born,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the first stage of his life is one of</v>

10
00:00:56.700 --> 00:00:58.940
<v Speaker 1>infantile omnipotence,</v>
<v Speaker 1>vr.</v>

11
00:00:58.950 --> 00:01:03.090
<v Speaker 1>At first it needs of knowing we are</v>
<v Speaker 1>special and the central focus of our</v>

12
00:01:03.091 --> 00:01:05.910
<v Speaker 1>parents care and concern.</v>
<v Speaker 1>At this point,</v>

13
00:01:05.911 --> 00:01:08.910
<v Speaker 1>we cannot see beyond our own needs in</v>
<v Speaker 1>the lion king,</v>

14
00:01:08.911 --> 00:01:11.040
<v Speaker 1>Simba is not only the center of his</v>
<v Speaker 1>parents,</v>

15
00:01:11.041 --> 00:01:13.800
<v Speaker 1>universe birth,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he is bound down before by the whole</v>

16
00:01:13.801 --> 00:01:15.330
<v Speaker 1>assembled African wildlife.</v>

17
00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:19.000
<v Speaker 2>Everything that like touches is our</v>
<v Speaker 2>kingdom.</v>

18
00:01:21.550 --> 00:01:25.570
<v Speaker 2>A King's time is ruler rises and falls</v>
<v Speaker 2>like the sun.</v>

19
00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:30.970
<v Speaker 2>One day Simba,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the Sun will set on my time here and</v>

20
00:01:30.971 --> 00:01:35.971
<v Speaker 2>will rise with you as the new king.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Everything</v>

21
00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:41.750
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>however it creates a problem.</v>

22
00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:45.170
<v Speaker 1>Thanks to his father's rule.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The pride lands are imbalance.</v>

23
00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:49.220
<v Speaker 1>Simba is this born in paradise and in</v>
<v Speaker 1>his infant they'll nip Athens.</v>

24
00:01:49.221 --> 00:01:51.380
<v Speaker 1>He is the center of it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Therefore,</v>

25
00:01:51.381 --> 00:01:54.410
<v Speaker 1>there's nothing to prove himself,</v>
<v Speaker 1>nothing to conquer.</v>

26
00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:57.620
<v Speaker 1>Hence his fascination with the elephants</v>
<v Speaker 1>grief yards.</v>

27
00:01:57.710 --> 00:02:00.320
<v Speaker 1>Here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he can defy parental authority and show</v>

28
00:02:00.321 --> 00:02:04.790
<v Speaker 1>his bravery birth where his father's</v>
<v Speaker 1>bravery is a mature connection with the</v>

29
00:02:04.791 --> 00:02:09.440
<v Speaker 1>danger and the possibility of death.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Simba in his infantile omnipotence has</v>

30
00:02:09.441 --> 00:02:12.980
<v Speaker 1>no real connection to these things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A suit characterize argues in the</v>

31
00:02:12.981 --> 00:02:17.150
<v Speaker 1>Journal of child psychotherapy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Adolescent risk taking is so often off</v>

32
00:02:17.151 --> 00:02:20.120
<v Speaker 1>this nature.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a dare send out into the world to</v>

33
00:02:20.121 --> 00:02:24.830
<v Speaker 1>show that we are immune to vulnerability</v>
<v Speaker 1>without any real emotional connection to</v>

34
00:02:24.831 --> 00:02:26.840
<v Speaker 1>the dangerous.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We pretend to disdain</v>

35
00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:30.640
<v Speaker 2>being brave.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't mean you go looking for</v>

36
00:02:30.641 --> 00:02:32.750
<v Speaker 2>trouble.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're not scared of anything</v>

37
00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:37.180
<v Speaker 2>I was today.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>

38
00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:39.640
<v Speaker 2>I thought I might lose you.</v>

39
00:02:41.070 --> 00:02:45.900
<v Speaker 1>Of course this cannot last and to</v>
<v Speaker 1>reality of danger and death is trusted</v>

40
00:02:45.901 --> 00:02:50.670
<v Speaker 1>in December's life in a haunting way</v>
<v Speaker 1>when Mufasa dies while trying to save</v>

41
00:02:50.671 --> 00:02:54.930
<v Speaker 1>Simba due to a plot by my father's</v>
<v Speaker 1>brother's car is from a rational</v>

42
00:02:54.931 --> 00:02:58.230
<v Speaker 1>perspective,</v>
<v Speaker 1>rather unclear why Simba feel so guilty</v>

43
00:02:58.231 --> 00:03:00.960
<v Speaker 1>about his father's death.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He listened to scar wader.</v>

44
00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:04.870
<v Speaker 1>It's where it was still so wait for his</v>
<v Speaker 1>father and he didn't cost the stampede.</v>

45
00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:10.230
<v Speaker 1>So one argument is that felt unworthy of</v>
<v Speaker 1>being saved and worthy of his father's</v>

46
00:03:11.321 --> 00:03:12.600
<v Speaker 1>sacrifice.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

47
00:03:12.610 --> 00:03:16.980
<v Speaker 1>Fossa seems to rue flawlessly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He is a constant reminder of what Simba</v>

48
00:03:16.981 --> 00:03:20.490
<v Speaker 1>is not brave,</v>
<v Speaker 1>strong and wise after symbols,</v>

49
00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:24.400
<v Speaker 1>filter tend to prove himself worthy in</v>
<v Speaker 1>the elephants' graveyard it's facing</v>

50
00:03:24.401 --> 00:03:26.980
<v Speaker 1>now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He knows his arrogance and infantile</v>

51
00:03:26.981 --> 00:03:30.850
<v Speaker 1>omnipotence fades away and he feels</v>
<v Speaker 1>unworthy both of his father,</v>

52
00:03:30.851 --> 00:03:33.880
<v Speaker 1>his sacrifice and his destiny off being</v>
<v Speaker 1>king,</v>

53
00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:38.780
<v Speaker 1>so he runs</v>
<v Speaker 1>run away.</v>

54
00:03:40.510 --> 00:03:43.990
<v Speaker 1>Another key argument for skills is</v>
<v Speaker 1>Freudian oedipal teary,</v>

55
00:03:44.140 --> 00:03:48.640
<v Speaker 1>where fruit argues to wish of songs to</v>
<v Speaker 1>replace and take the positions of the</v>

56
00:03:48.641 --> 00:03:50.230
<v Speaker 1>father's dad.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You shouldn't.</v>

57
00:03:54.110 --> 00:03:56.510
<v Speaker 1>In the beginning of the film.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Timber in this arrogance,</v>

58
00:03:56.511 --> 00:04:00.530
<v Speaker 1>Singh's office wished to become king.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This of course implies determining his</v>

59
00:04:00.531 --> 00:04:05.480
<v Speaker 1>father or his father dying as was also</v>
<v Speaker 1>realized by on the strader's when the</v>

60
00:04:05.481 --> 00:04:06.500
<v Speaker 1>parody to song</v>

61
00:04:06.650 --> 00:04:07.860
<v Speaker 3>hello.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Hi.</v>

62
00:04:12.080 --> 00:04:16.220
<v Speaker 1>Simba is either consciously or</v>
<v Speaker 1>unconsciously aware of his wish to</v>

63
00:04:16.221 --> 00:04:19.130
<v Speaker 1>replace his father,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which feeds his feelings of guilt for</v>

64
00:04:19.131 --> 00:04:20.870
<v Speaker 1>his father's death.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Therefore,</v>

65
00:04:20.871 --> 00:04:25.040
<v Speaker 1>in an attempt to escape his guilt,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he runs away from his father's position</v>

66
00:04:25.041 --> 00:04:27.170
<v Speaker 1>as king.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He this rinse away,</v>

67
00:04:27.410 --> 00:04:30.800
<v Speaker 1>but it's not only from the private lands</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's right for places king,</v>

68
00:04:30.830 --> 00:04:34.550
<v Speaker 1>but also from all the personality traits</v>
<v Speaker 1>his father embodied.</v>

69
00:04:34.890 --> 00:04:36.910
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>got to put your past behind.</v>

70
00:04:36.911 --> 00:04:40.900
<v Speaker 3>You look at bad things happen and you</v>
<v Speaker 3>can't do anything about it.</v>

71
00:04:40.930 --> 00:04:41.770
<v Speaker 3>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right,</v>

72
00:04:41.950 --> 00:04:45.160
<v Speaker 3>wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When the world turns its back on you,</v>

73
00:04:45.340 --> 00:04:47.560
<v Speaker 3>you turn your back on Delaware.</v>

74
00:04:47.860 --> 00:04:51.610
<v Speaker 1>It is here that Simba anthers and</v>
<v Speaker 1>adolescent phase where he chooses</v>

75
00:04:51.611 --> 00:04:55.870
<v Speaker 1>escapism in pleasure,</v>
<v Speaker 1>discarding any responsibility he joins a</v>

76
00:04:55.871 --> 00:05:00.760
<v Speaker 1>gang or fourth categorized describes as</v>
<v Speaker 1>a sexual dropouts where the prevailing</v>

77
00:05:00.761 --> 00:05:04.870
<v Speaker 1>wisdom is not to worry about any</v>
<v Speaker 1>consequences of one's actions.</v>

78
00:05:09.910 --> 00:05:13.050
<v Speaker 3>Dan,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a problem three</v>

79
00:05:19.500 --> 00:05:22.080
<v Speaker 1>this way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Similar defense himself from his guilt</v>

80
00:05:22.110 --> 00:05:26.460
<v Speaker 1>by cutting himself off from the past and</v>
<v Speaker 1>immersing himself in living in the</v>

81
00:05:26.461 --> 00:05:29.130
<v Speaker 1>moment.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's quite telling that in this sequence</v>

82
00:05:29.131 --> 00:05:33.060
<v Speaker 1>Simba turns to eating bugs and just</v>
<v Speaker 1>having his Neil's faults by [inaudible]</v>

83
00:05:33.540 --> 00:05:36.360
<v Speaker 1>where Simba first envied his father</v>
<v Speaker 1>strength,</v>

84
00:05:36.420 --> 00:05:39.780
<v Speaker 1>power and aggression and tried to</v>
<v Speaker 1>emulate those traits,</v>

85
00:05:39.920 --> 00:05:42.630
<v Speaker 1>no fuels,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these traits and his rivalry with his</v>

86
00:05:42.631 --> 00:05:45.510
<v Speaker 1>father were responsible for his father's</v>
<v Speaker 1>death.</v>

87
00:05:45.810 --> 00:05:48.570
<v Speaker 1>Therefore he relinquishes his</v>
<v Speaker 1>competitiveness,</v>

88
00:05:48.571 --> 00:05:53.160
<v Speaker 1>healthy aggression and ambition in fear</v>
<v Speaker 1>that he cannot control these traits and</v>

89
00:05:53.190 --> 00:05:57.380
<v Speaker 1>we'll become destructive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Simba at this point is not aware that</v>

90
00:05:57.381 --> 00:06:01.670
<v Speaker 1>giving up these traits has a cost as</v>
<v Speaker 1>well and that it is not the solution.</v>

91
00:06:01.970 --> 00:06:05.810
<v Speaker 1>If we give up our ambition,</v>
<v Speaker 1>competitiveness and aggression for</v>

92
00:06:05.811 --> 00:06:09.170
<v Speaker 1>escape pleasure,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we cannot develop ourselves fully and</v>

93
00:06:09.171 --> 00:06:12.170
<v Speaker 1>take our place in the world in an</v>
<v Speaker 1>escapist position,</v>

94
00:06:12.171 --> 00:06:16.190
<v Speaker 1>we will remain self centered and enabled</v>
<v Speaker 1>to help those around us.</v>

95
00:06:16.220 --> 00:06:19.400
<v Speaker 1>Eventually both our own lives and our</v>
<v Speaker 1>surroundings,</v>

96
00:06:19.401 --> 00:06:23.210
<v Speaker 1>we all start falling apart as Jordan</v>
<v Speaker 1>Peterson states.</v>

97
00:06:23.600 --> 00:06:25.970
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we have this strange idea that's</v>

98
00:06:25.971 --> 00:06:29.660
<v Speaker 1>especially again foisted on young men</v>
<v Speaker 1>that the pathway to virtue is through</v>

99
00:06:29.661 --> 00:06:33.920
<v Speaker 1>weakness and harmlessness and that's</v>
<v Speaker 1>just simply not true that that that's</v>

100
00:06:33.921 --> 00:06:36.400
<v Speaker 1>the pathway to uselessness and</v>
<v Speaker 1>resentment.</v>

101
00:06:36.790 --> 00:06:40.250
<v Speaker 1>Cimbar realizes this when Nala confronts</v>
<v Speaker 1>him to,</v>

102
00:06:40.280 --> 00:06:42.770
<v Speaker 1>to symbolic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>opting out of responsibility,</v>

103
00:06:42.771 --> 00:06:46.760
<v Speaker 1>the pride lands have fallen into ruin</v>
<v Speaker 1>and all animals are suffering.</v>

104
00:06:47.180 --> 00:06:50.090
<v Speaker 3>Look,</v>
<v Speaker 3>sometimes bad things happens and there's</v>

105
00:06:50.091 --> 00:06:53.330
<v Speaker 3>nothing you can do about it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So why worry?</v>

106
00:06:53.390 --> 00:06:55.220
<v Speaker 3>Because it's your responsibility.</v>

107
00:06:56.240 --> 00:07:01.130
<v Speaker 1>Tim Bias to tear himself away from the</v>
<v Speaker 1>escapists pleasures off his Hakuna</v>

108
00:07:01.130 --> 00:07:04.880
<v Speaker 1>Matata philosophy in order to take a</v>
<v Speaker 1>mature place in a world where he can be</v>

109
00:07:04.881 --> 00:07:08.120
<v Speaker 1>responsible for himself and others to do</v>
<v Speaker 1>this.</v>

110
00:07:08.121 --> 00:07:11.030
<v Speaker 1>However,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he must complete a difficult task or</v>

111
00:07:11.031 --> 00:07:14.390
<v Speaker 1>facing himself and his guilt of his</v>
<v Speaker 1>father's death.</v>

112
00:07:15.560 --> 00:07:17.360
<v Speaker 3>You said you'd always be there for me.</v>

113
00:07:19.020 --> 00:07:19.853
<v Speaker 4>That's true or not.</v>

114
00:07:23.040 --> 00:07:24.540
<v Speaker 1>It's because of me.</v>

115
00:07:26.030 --> 00:07:27.200
<v Speaker 4>It's my fault.</v>

116
00:07:28.800 --> 00:07:29.633
<v Speaker 3>It's life</v>

117
00:07:31.150 --> 00:07:34.330
<v Speaker 1>as client stays.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The oedipal struggle is to relinquish</v>

118
00:07:34.331 --> 00:07:36.430
<v Speaker 1>one's wish to take the fall dish</v>
<v Speaker 1>replace,</v>

119
00:07:36.490 --> 00:07:40.900
<v Speaker 1>but instead of taking one's own place in</v>
<v Speaker 1>the world while still adopting was good</v>

120
00:07:40.901 --> 00:07:44.230
<v Speaker 1>in a father too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Happy to be both like him and different</v>

121
00:07:44.231 --> 00:07:47.560
<v Speaker 1>than him instead of needing to be in in</v>
<v Speaker 1>the lion king.</v>

122
00:07:47.590 --> 00:07:50.470
<v Speaker 1>This is symbolized beautifully by</v>
<v Speaker 1>visualizing symbols,</v>

123
00:07:50.471 --> 00:07:54.610
<v Speaker 1>internal struggle through him finding</v>
<v Speaker 1>his rate through tick tones and then</v>

124
00:07:54.611 --> 00:07:58.060
<v Speaker 1>seeing himself and his father in his</v>
<v Speaker 1>reflection in the water</v>

125
00:08:01.650 --> 00:08:05.300
<v Speaker 2>you see</v>
<v Speaker 2>he needs.</v>

126
00:08:09.240 --> 00:08:12.210
<v Speaker 1>I think this is the key moment of Simba</v>
<v Speaker 1>story,</v>

127
00:08:12.360 --> 00:08:17.070
<v Speaker 1>the painful journey or facing himself</v>
<v Speaker 1>and his guilt about his father is what</v>

128
00:08:17.071 --> 00:08:21.630
<v Speaker 1>enables Simba to transcend this</v>
<v Speaker 1>adolescence and become a man or in this</v>

129
00:08:21.631 --> 00:08:26.400
<v Speaker 1>case lion in his own rights.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Simba understands that he is not as far</v>

130
00:08:26.401 --> 00:08:31.040
<v Speaker 1>though that he can find his father</v>
<v Speaker 1>within him only by internalizing Mufasa</v>

131
00:08:31.140 --> 00:08:33.390
<v Speaker 1>and the qualities here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>narratives from him,</v>

132
00:08:33.391 --> 00:08:38.391
<v Speaker 1>Simba can adopt responsibility for</v>
<v Speaker 1>others and face scar in order to restore</v>

133
00:08:38.401 --> 00:08:42.630
<v Speaker 1>the pride lands to balance.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the end to center architect Malesan</v>

134
00:08:42.631 --> 00:08:46.470
<v Speaker 1>lesson off the lion king is that in</v>
<v Speaker 1>order to grow up we must adopt</v>

135
00:08:46.471 --> 00:08:51.450
<v Speaker 1>responsibility of ourselves and others.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If we choose to escape its pleasures and</v>

136
00:08:51.451 --> 00:08:55.230
<v Speaker 1>renounce our healthy aggression,</v>
<v Speaker 1>our competitiveness and ambition,</v>

137
00:08:55.260 --> 00:08:58.310
<v Speaker 1>we've become unable to engage</v>
<v Speaker 1>productively in the world.</v>

138
00:08:58.680 --> 00:09:02.370
<v Speaker 1>To remember that who we are is to</v>
<v Speaker 1>remember where we can be.</v>

139
00:09:02.630 --> 00:09:07.630
<v Speaker 1>It is to adopt the responsibility or</v>
<v Speaker 1>realizing our full potential and to try</v>

140
00:09:07.771 --> 00:09:12.771
<v Speaker 1>to make our world a better place.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All right.</v>
