1
00:00:05.480 --> 00:00:08.150
<v Speaker 1>Mazes have fascinated us for tens of</v>
<v Speaker 1>thousands.</v>

2
00:00:08.180 --> 00:00:13.180
<v Speaker 1>So if years from ancient wall drawings</v>
<v Speaker 1>to Greek and Roman mythology to modern</v>

3
00:00:13.921 --> 00:00:18.870
<v Speaker 1>film mazes and labyrinths have on some</v>
<v Speaker 1>level always strongly resonated with the</v>

4
00:00:18.871 --> 00:00:22.500
<v Speaker 1>human experience and seeing at a</v>
<v Speaker 1>symbolical layered deeper than the</v>

5
00:00:22.501 --> 00:00:25.980
<v Speaker 1>merely physical experience you get from</v>
<v Speaker 1>exploring it's corridors,</v>

6
00:00:26.280 --> 00:00:30.810
<v Speaker 1>which is a reason why I got intrigued by</v>
<v Speaker 1>Denis Villeneuve's 2014 film prisoners</v>

7
00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:33.840
<v Speaker 1>and how it uses mazes as a symbol in</v>
<v Speaker 1>prisoners.</v>

8
00:00:33.841 --> 00:00:36.360
<v Speaker 1>We never get to see amaze in its</v>
<v Speaker 1>physical form.</v>

9
00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:38.850
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the maize is not even billy explicitly</v>

10
00:00:38.851 --> 00:00:41.220
<v Speaker 1>mentioned at all until later in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>story.</v>

11
00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:45.210
<v Speaker 1>I look totally amazed that a map</v>
<v Speaker 1>guarding fundraisers remaining in the</v>

12
00:00:45.211 --> 00:00:47.730
<v Speaker 1>background for the better first half of</v>
<v Speaker 1>the film,</v>

13
00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:49.520
<v Speaker 1>yet it's significant.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Shoot,</v>

14
00:00:49.521 --> 00:00:53.820
<v Speaker 1>not be understated as the nice film of</v>
<v Speaker 1>himself seems to have somewhat of a mild</v>

15
00:00:53.821 --> 00:00:56.880
<v Speaker 1>obsession with these puzzles,</v>
<v Speaker 1>with characters having to venture</v>

16
00:00:56.881 --> 00:00:59.400
<v Speaker 1>through both physical and mental</v>
<v Speaker 1>corridors,</v>

17
00:00:59.401 --> 00:01:02.430
<v Speaker 1>trying not to lose themselves in search</v>
<v Speaker 1>of answers,</v>

18
00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:06.150
<v Speaker 1>answers about family,</v>
<v Speaker 1>about what's right and what's wrong</v>

19
00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:07.920
<v Speaker 1>about life,</v>
<v Speaker 1>death,</v>

20
00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:12.390
<v Speaker 1>what connects us through language and</v>
<v Speaker 1>about faith in the face of evil.</v>

21
00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:14.940
<v Speaker 1>If you'll notice,</v>
<v Speaker 1>puzzle is one that focuses on the</v>

22
00:01:14.941 --> 00:01:18.000
<v Speaker 1>metaphorical and the psychological</v>
<v Speaker 1>symbolism of the maze,</v>

23
00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:21.510
<v Speaker 1>rather than having it directly manifest</v>
<v Speaker 1>itself in its physical form.</v>

24
00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:22.710
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>most western May,</v>

25
00:01:22.711 --> 00:01:26.430
<v Speaker 1>symbolism seems to be derived from the</v>
<v Speaker 1>Greek myth of theseus and the minutes</v>

26
00:01:26.431 --> 00:01:30.750
<v Speaker 1>are which sells historian easiest,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who needs to find and kill a monstrous</v>

27
00:01:30.751 --> 00:01:34.470
<v Speaker 1>beast at the center of the labyrinth</v>
<v Speaker 1>using a threat of hair from his lover</v>

28
00:01:34.471 --> 00:01:36.390
<v Speaker 1>area.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ariadne needs to make sure he doesn't</v>

29
00:01:36.391 --> 00:01:39.540
<v Speaker 1>get lost along the way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now compare that to the story of</v>

30
00:01:39.541 --> 00:01:41.880
<v Speaker 1>prisoners,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is about the kidnapping of two</v>

31
00:01:41.881 --> 00:01:45.420
<v Speaker 1>daughters and how the characters involve</v>
<v Speaker 1>choose to react in order to get them</v>

32
00:01:45.421 --> 00:01:48.100
<v Speaker 1>back.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The main focus here is placed on to</v>

33
00:01:48.101 --> 00:01:51.070
<v Speaker 1>character Keller Dover,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a religious and protective,</v>

34
00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:55.300
<v Speaker 1>that who will do anything to keep his</v>
<v Speaker 1>family safe and who will ultimately find</v>

35
00:01:55.301 --> 00:01:59.680
<v Speaker 1>the monster of his world with the help</v>
<v Speaker 1>of a young girl and Loki and ace</v>

36
00:01:59.681 --> 00:02:02.950
<v Speaker 1>detective with a troubled background,</v>
<v Speaker 1>tasks of the mission to solve the</v>

37
00:02:02.951 --> 00:02:06.520
<v Speaker 1>mystery and find a missing kids,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so only metaphorical level.</v>

38
00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:10.770
<v Speaker 1>The maze in prisoners then seems to</v>
<v Speaker 1>loosely echoed as age old Greek myth.</v>

39
00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:15.420
<v Speaker 1>Both these men set out on a search using</v>
<v Speaker 1>their own respective belief systems to</v>

40
00:02:15.421 --> 00:02:18.780
<v Speaker 1>lead them through the metaphorical maze</v>
<v Speaker 1>of mystery and morality,</v>

41
00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:22.710
<v Speaker 1>hoping to find the truth at the center</v>
<v Speaker 1>and to confront those responsible for</v>

42
00:02:22.711 --> 00:02:25.220
<v Speaker 1>the kidnapping.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It perhaps more strikingly similar</v>

43
00:02:25.221 --> 00:02:28.670
<v Speaker 1>connection can be found in Nordic</v>
<v Speaker 1>mythology involving a maiden horror</v>

44
00:02:28.671 --> 00:02:30.680
<v Speaker 1>princess stuck in the center of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>maze,</v>

45
00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:32.090
<v Speaker 1>again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>guarded by months,</v>

46
00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:34.990
<v Speaker 1>creature of source,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the late poet Robert Graves,</v>

47
00:02:35.020 --> 00:02:38.650
<v Speaker 1>argued that what these very stories have</v>
<v Speaker 1>in common is that they share a journey</v>

48
00:02:38.651 --> 00:02:42.770
<v Speaker 1>of the main character into Bofi physical</v>
<v Speaker 1>as well as a mental underworld.</v>

49
00:02:43.270 --> 00:02:45.710
<v Speaker 1>Keller nurturers daughter might be a</v>
<v Speaker 1>physical one,</v>

50
00:02:45.711 --> 00:02:49.430
<v Speaker 1>but as his faith is challenged and he's</v>
<v Speaker 1>forced to confront the darker and more</v>

51
00:02:49.490 --> 00:02:52.730
<v Speaker 1>violent parts of his nature,</v>
<v Speaker 1>his journey into the maze of the honor</v>

52
00:02:52.731 --> 00:02:57.260
<v Speaker 1>ruled increasingly becomes a mental one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so much so that his goal to protect his</v>

53
00:02:57.261 --> 00:03:01.600
<v Speaker 1>family almost ends up destroying as he</v>
<v Speaker 1>neglects his traumatized wife and</v>

54
00:03:01.601 --> 00:03:06.530
<v Speaker 1>increasingly regresses back into old</v>
<v Speaker 1>destructive habits and places until he'd</v>

55
00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:09.790
<v Speaker 1>literally descends into his own darkest</v>
<v Speaker 1>place imaginable,</v>

56
00:03:10.210 --> 00:03:12.460
<v Speaker 1>helpless and unable to save his</v>
<v Speaker 1>daughter.</v>

57
00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:17.350
<v Speaker 1>Low key on the other hand,</v>
<v Speaker 1>has to unravel the truth by descending</v>

58
00:03:17.351 --> 00:03:21.250
<v Speaker 1>into a more physical hell,</v>
<v Speaker 1>trying to find order and disorder and</v>

59
00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:23.770
<v Speaker 1>literally facing off against the forces</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the devil</v>

60
00:03:24.010 --> 00:03:26.950
<v Speaker 2>making children disappears.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The war we wage</v>

61
00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:32.280
<v Speaker 1>the maze here seems to be a symbol for</v>
<v Speaker 1>the chaos to Jones is set up under</v>

62
00:03:32.310 --> 00:03:35.490
<v Speaker 1>victims until they killed him off with</v>
<v Speaker 1>the venom of a snake,</v>

63
00:03:35.730 --> 00:03:39.900
<v Speaker 1>the disciples symbol for the devil and</v>
<v Speaker 1>the archetype of the maze and prisoners</v>

64
00:03:39.901 --> 00:03:42.270
<v Speaker 1>seems to stand for the opposite of</v>
<v Speaker 1>Paradise.</v>

65
00:03:42.630 --> 00:03:45.180
<v Speaker 1>We're in the words of playwright Eugene,</v>
<v Speaker 1>UNESCO.</v>

66
00:03:45.630 --> 00:03:48.180
<v Speaker 1>If goodness is order,</v>
<v Speaker 1>evil must be disordered,</v>

67
00:03:48.370 --> 00:03:51.300
<v Speaker 1>straight path or the maze and it's if</v>
<v Speaker 1>this insight,</v>

68
00:03:51.301 --> 00:03:54.300
<v Speaker 1>the Vilna of utilize this symbol to</v>
<v Speaker 1>explore it and morality in the</v>

69
00:03:54.301 --> 00:03:58.760
<v Speaker 1>psychological nature of his character's</v>
<v Speaker 1>Keller starts off as an open league</v>

70
00:03:58.770 --> 00:04:02.850
<v Speaker 1>devout Christian which has made quite</v>
<v Speaker 1>obvious through his usage of prayers</v>

71
00:04:03.150 --> 00:04:07.530
<v Speaker 1>will be done on earth,</v>
<v Speaker 1>be abundance of Christian symbolism</v>

72
00:04:07.531 --> 00:04:10.920
<v Speaker 1>surrounding him,</v>
<v Speaker 1>his metaphorically appropriate job as a</v>

73
00:04:10.921 --> 00:04:13.800
<v Speaker 1>carpenter and through to names of his</v>
<v Speaker 1>wife and mother.</v>

74
00:04:14.610 --> 00:04:16.830
<v Speaker 1>Moreover,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Keller was shown to have a proclivity</v>

75
00:04:16.831 --> 00:04:21.180
<v Speaker 1>for orderliness and preparedness.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Both traits that consciously define his</v>

76
00:04:21.181 --> 00:04:22.410
<v Speaker 1>character.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hurry for the best,</v>

77
00:04:22.411 --> 00:04:24.480
<v Speaker 1>prepare for the worst.</v>
<v Speaker 1>However,</v>

78
00:04:24.481 --> 00:04:28.320
<v Speaker 1>as I've shown Keller's journey is one of</v>
<v Speaker 1>increasing amounts of disorder,</v>

79
00:04:28.610 --> 00:04:32.460
<v Speaker 1>Aquestt that shakes his faith to at</v>
<v Speaker 1>score as he sees himself for super form</v>

80
00:04:32.461 --> 00:04:36.540
<v Speaker 1>ever escalating brutalities on the</v>
<v Speaker 1>person he suspects holds the key to his</v>

81
00:04:36.541 --> 00:04:37.240
<v Speaker 1>daughter.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

82
00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:38.340
<v Speaker 1>he making me do this.</v>

83
00:04:41.450 --> 00:04:44.780
<v Speaker 1>It's only at the end of this journey</v>
<v Speaker 1>when he's in his darkest place that he</v>

84
00:04:44.781 --> 00:04:47.840
<v Speaker 1>finally surrenders and returns to his</v>
<v Speaker 1>faith in God.</v>

85
00:04:50.600 --> 00:04:51.433
<v Speaker 2>Check mine.</v>

86
00:04:52.290 --> 00:04:55.770
<v Speaker 1>Detective Loki goes down eight decidedly</v>
<v Speaker 1>different bath of the maze.</v>

87
00:04:56.010 --> 00:04:59.190
<v Speaker 1>His faith is based in both the Christian</v>
<v Speaker 1>as well as the pagan.</v>

88
00:04:59.640 --> 00:05:01.530
<v Speaker 1>The eight point,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it starts at two on his neck,</v>

89
00:05:01.531 --> 00:05:03.970
<v Speaker 1>referring to such things as redemption.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Youmail.</v>

90
00:05:04.040 --> 00:05:07.800
<v Speaker 1>The strength and compassion is Mason</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ring representing the search for</v>

91
00:05:07.801 --> 00:05:11.430
<v Speaker 1>enlightenment and rationality,</v>
<v Speaker 1>aligning perfectly with his character</v>

92
00:05:11.431 --> 00:05:13.740
<v Speaker 1>and the posing to more emotionally based</v>
<v Speaker 1>Geller,</v>

93
00:05:14.070 --> 00:05:16.410
<v Speaker 1>his odd name and turn.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It comes from the Nordic God,</v>

94
00:05:16.411 --> 00:05:19.620
<v Speaker 1>Loki gunning,</v>
<v Speaker 1>trickster and occasional helper of other</v>

95
00:05:19.621 --> 00:05:20.454
<v Speaker 1>gods.</v>

96
00:05:20.470 --> 00:05:23.200
<v Speaker 3>And even though the ace tech,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the fish show nuts to be immune to</v>

97
00:05:23.201 --> 00:05:25.750
<v Speaker 3>frustration,</v>
<v Speaker 3>never truly breaks away from his</v>

98
00:05:25.751 --> 00:05:26.584
<v Speaker 3>beliefs,</v>

99
00:05:26.630 --> 00:05:29.900
<v Speaker 1>ultimately help them in finding the</v>
<v Speaker 1>missing children and solving the</v>

100
00:05:29.901 --> 00:05:32.510
<v Speaker 1>mystery.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So besides acting as a symbol for the</v>

101
00:05:32.511 --> 00:05:35.050
<v Speaker 1>physical and metaphorical journey and</v>
<v Speaker 1>judy underworld,</v>

102
00:05:35.100 --> 00:05:38.060
<v Speaker 1>the also comes to represent a</v>
<v Speaker 1>psychological struggle.</v>

103
00:05:38.090 --> 00:05:41.450
<v Speaker 1>And the human brain,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Stanley Kubrick show this in connection</v>

104
00:05:41.451 --> 00:05:44.330
<v Speaker 1>with the growing and sanity of Jack</v>
<v Speaker 1>Torrance in the shining.</v>

105
00:05:44.540 --> 00:05:47.420
<v Speaker 1>But it's also a symbolism.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It has ample historical grounding.</v>

106
00:05:47.510 --> 00:05:51.560
<v Speaker 1>Both Christian and pagan famous around</v>
<v Speaker 1>the world have used a symbol of a linear</v>

107
00:05:51.561 --> 00:05:56.561
<v Speaker 1>one way labyrinth as a meditative baff</v>
<v Speaker 1>way towards the center towards God self</v>

108
00:05:58.400 --> 00:06:00.770
<v Speaker 1>and the tree of life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Psychoanalysts,</v>

109
00:06:00.771 --> 00:06:03.080
<v Speaker 1>Carl Young,</v>
<v Speaker 1>recognized labyrinths and similar</v>

110
00:06:03.081 --> 00:06:06.170
<v Speaker 1>figures of centers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sculpt Mandalis as a universally</v>

111
00:06:06.171 --> 00:06:09.410
<v Speaker 1>recurring archetype always standing for</v>
<v Speaker 1>transformation,</v>

112
00:06:09.411 --> 00:06:11.870
<v Speaker 1>wholeness,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the totality of an individual's</v>

113
00:06:11.871 --> 00:06:14.390
<v Speaker 1>reality.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The symbols can appear on the most</v>

114
00:06:14.391 --> 00:06:19.070
<v Speaker 1>common of household objects and things</v>
<v Speaker 1>like below sweaters and picture frames</v>

115
00:06:19.340 --> 00:06:22.670
<v Speaker 1>which are also expressed through</v>
<v Speaker 1>religion suggest a Christian Cross and</v>

116
00:06:22.671 --> 00:06:23.570
<v Speaker 1>the tree of life.</v>

117
00:06:24.050 --> 00:06:27.260
<v Speaker 1>It wouldn't cross as I've shown his</v>
<v Speaker 1>already abundantly represented them</v>

118
00:06:27.261 --> 00:06:29.330
<v Speaker 1>prisoners,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but so was the tree of life.</v>

119
00:06:29.690 --> 00:06:30.830
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>feel no spares,</v>

120
00:06:30.831 --> 00:06:33.110
<v Speaker 1>no expense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Focusing his lens on trees,</v>

121
00:06:33.200 --> 00:06:36.940
<v Speaker 1>making them part of the plot and having</v>
<v Speaker 1>his main character interact with its</v>

122
00:06:36.950 --> 00:06:40.130
<v Speaker 1>substance.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Trees undeniably take on an important</v>

123
00:06:40.131 --> 00:06:44.210
<v Speaker 1>role in the film and it's no coincidence</v>
<v Speaker 1>that they too are connected to demand a</v>

124
00:06:44.211 --> 00:06:47.000
<v Speaker 1>symbol and by extension the labyrinth</v>
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>

125
00:06:47.001 --> 00:06:50.570
<v Speaker 1>Physical form is also a direct metaphor</v>
<v Speaker 1>for the human nervous system and the</v>

126
00:06:50.571 --> 00:06:53.130
<v Speaker 1>psychological state of our characters</v>
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>

127
00:06:53.150 --> 00:06:56.390
<v Speaker 1>Bare and leafless branches aligning with</v>
<v Speaker 1>our mood and mental state,</v>

128
00:06:56.630 --> 00:06:59.150
<v Speaker 1>which brings us back to the maze used by</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Joneses.</v>

129
00:06:59.210 --> 00:07:02.810
<v Speaker 1>Now it's important to know that this</v>
<v Speaker 1>particular maize is not a simple linear</v>

130
00:07:02.811 --> 00:07:04.910
<v Speaker 1>one far from it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a connection.</v>

131
00:07:05.570 --> 00:07:06.590
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Connection is,</v>

132
00:07:06.591 --> 00:07:10.970
<v Speaker 1>it's the last amazing book.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's no way out your core there.</v>

133
00:07:10.970 --> 00:07:14.570
<v Speaker 1>LSD influenced May's processes</v>
<v Speaker 1>specifically designed to mentally</v>

134
00:07:14.571 --> 00:07:17.840
<v Speaker 1>blocked our victims in their journey</v>
<v Speaker 1>towards self individualization.</v>

135
00:07:18.320 --> 00:07:22.040
<v Speaker 1>It's a form of mind control that can</v>
<v Speaker 1>help explain why Alex seems to be stuck</v>

136
00:07:22.041 --> 00:07:24.440
<v Speaker 1>in the mind of a 10 year old and why</v>
<v Speaker 1>Bobby Taylor,</v>

137
00:07:24.470 --> 00:07:26.870
<v Speaker 1>although physically free is still</v>
<v Speaker 1>obsessive.</v>

138
00:07:26.871 --> 00:07:29.510
<v Speaker 1>Lee trying to find a way out of his own</v>
<v Speaker 1>mental health,</v>

139
00:07:29.690 --> 00:07:33.210
<v Speaker 1>but the maize is not just a tool for the</v>
<v Speaker 1>Joneses to imprison children and learn</v>

140
00:07:33.230 --> 00:07:35.390
<v Speaker 1>their parents.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It also goes to show how some of the</v>

141
00:07:35.391 --> 00:07:37.400
<v Speaker 1>characters had been stuck in there all</v>
<v Speaker 1>along.</v>

142
00:07:37.640 --> 00:07:41.390
<v Speaker 1>It's revealed that gathers dad committed</v>
<v Speaker 1>suicide in his house when Keller himself</v>

143
00:07:41.391 --> 00:07:44.410
<v Speaker 1>was still a team.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The contrast between his study house and</v>

144
00:07:44.411 --> 00:07:46.770
<v Speaker 1>is the lap.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's aided parental home and calories,</v>

145
00:07:46.850 --> 00:07:50.120
<v Speaker 1>unwillingness to renovate the place.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like I keep telling your mother it's an</v>

146
00:07:50.121 --> 00:07:53.540
<v Speaker 1>old building will cost a fortune to fix</v>
<v Speaker 1>it up revealed to us that the death of</v>

147
00:07:53.541 --> 00:07:56.090
<v Speaker 1>his father has still not been resolved</v>
<v Speaker 1>in his mind.</v>

148
00:07:56.540 --> 00:08:00.650
<v Speaker 1>Keller self grove as a teen has been</v>
<v Speaker 1>stunted by this drama and in a way he is</v>

149
00:08:00.651 --> 00:08:05.180
<v Speaker 1>as much a prisoner as Alex Jones and</v>
<v Speaker 1>Bobby Taylor has repressed feelings of</v>

150
00:08:05.181 --> 00:08:07.820
<v Speaker 1>rage and despair,</v>
<v Speaker 1>awakened by the kidnapping of his</v>

151
00:08:07.821 --> 00:08:10.430
<v Speaker 1>daughter.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Even killer's name meaning basement in</v>

152
00:08:10.431 --> 00:08:12.940
<v Speaker 1>German,</v>
<v Speaker 1>speaks to his character is hidden away</v>

153
00:08:12.950 --> 00:08:15.950
<v Speaker 1>mental trauma and foreshadows his</v>
<v Speaker 1>destiny perfectly.</v>

154
00:08:16.700 --> 00:08:20.270
<v Speaker 1>Holly Jones on herter and has been a</v>
<v Speaker 1>prisoner of our own respect of maize for</v>

155
00:08:20.271 --> 00:08:24.200
<v Speaker 1>quite some time after their son died of</v>
<v Speaker 1>cancer to one's devout Christians,</v>

156
00:08:24.201 --> 00:08:28.010
<v Speaker 1>lost our faith and decided to best to</v>
<v Speaker 1>drag as many people into their mental</v>

157
00:08:28.011 --> 00:08:30.590
<v Speaker 1>health was possible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Even detective Loki seems to have</v>

158
00:08:30.591 --> 00:08:33.050
<v Speaker 1>struggled with his own maze during his</v>
<v Speaker 1>troubled childhood.</v>

159
00:08:33.340 --> 00:08:34.910
<v Speaker 1>You know what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I spent six years old and having two</v>

160
00:08:34.911 --> 00:08:39.800
<v Speaker 1>boys home and you know the Hunnington</v>
<v Speaker 1>boys hurting a fuck like you'd be a real</v>

161
00:08:39.801 --> 00:08:40.340
<v Speaker 1>treat for me.</v>

162
00:08:40.340 --> 00:08:41.930
<v Speaker 1>What you telling me the difference of</v>
<v Speaker 1>yours?</v>

163
00:08:41.931 --> 00:08:45.230
<v Speaker 1>That Loki is the only one of these</v>
<v Speaker 1>characters who like in the story of</v>

164
00:08:45.231 --> 00:08:49.850
<v Speaker 1>Andrea [inaudible] is elevated himself</v>
<v Speaker 1>from the mental trap raising his</v>

165
00:08:49.851 --> 00:08:53.540
<v Speaker 1>consciousness in the process.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's only fitting that he grows up to be</v>

166
00:08:53.541 --> 00:08:57.240
<v Speaker 1>an ace detective tasked with and guiding</v>
<v Speaker 1>others out of the maze.</v>

167
00:08:57.660 --> 00:09:00.240
<v Speaker 1>If the Jones is our disturbance of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>devil and trauma,</v>

168
00:09:00.300 --> 00:09:02.760
<v Speaker 1>Loki is to serve one of God and</v>
<v Speaker 1>enlightenment.</v>

169
00:09:03.330 --> 00:09:06.600
<v Speaker 1>The maze is an incredibly relevant</v>
<v Speaker 1>archetypal symbol of the human</v>

170
00:09:06.601 --> 00:09:09.540
<v Speaker 1>experience.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It has been for thousands of years and</v>

171
00:09:09.541 --> 00:09:12.990
<v Speaker 1>it continues to do so in our world and</v>
<v Speaker 1>in films like prisoners,</v>

172
00:09:13.500 --> 00:09:15.900
<v Speaker 1>the needs of El Nerf and writer Aaron</v>
<v Speaker 1>goosy Koski.</v>

173
00:09:15.901 --> 00:09:19.380
<v Speaker 1>You have shown that through adequate,</v>
<v Speaker 1>perhaps at times instinctive knowledge</v>

174
00:09:19.381 --> 00:09:23.400
<v Speaker 1>of his symbol it film can take on</v>
<v Speaker 1>equality to test the ability to make us</v>

175
00:09:23.401 --> 00:09:27.090
<v Speaker 1>wonder about it long after the credits</v>
<v Speaker 1>roll and not just because the symbol</v>

176
00:09:27.091 --> 00:09:29.940
<v Speaker 1>fits well with its story,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but more importantly because it</v>

177
00:09:29.941 --> 00:09:33.930
<v Speaker 1>expresses a truth about the human</v>
<v Speaker 1>experience that universally resonates of</v>

178
00:09:33.931 --> 00:09:37.770
<v Speaker 1>us as human beings and our endless</v>
<v Speaker 1>struggle and journey towards a higher</v>

179
00:09:37.771 --> 00:09:39.840
<v Speaker 1>self.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In the words of the late union</v>

180
00:09:39.841 --> 00:09:43.590
<v Speaker 1>psychoanalysts Edward See Whitman,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of the oldest images of the mystery</v>

181
00:09:43.591 --> 00:09:44.670
<v Speaker 1>of life,</v>
<v Speaker 1>death,</v>

182
00:09:44.671 --> 00:09:48.450
<v Speaker 1>transformation and return is the</v>
<v Speaker 1>labyrinth that depicts the way to be</v>

183
00:09:48.451 --> 00:09:49.320
<v Speaker 1>unknown.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Center,</v>

184
00:09:49.410 --> 00:09:52.440
<v Speaker 1>the mystery of death and rebirth,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your risk of the search,</v>

185
00:09:52.560 --> 00:09:56.970
<v Speaker 1>the danger of losing the way the quests</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the finding and the ability to</v>

186
00:09:56.971 --> 00:09:57.804
<v Speaker 1>return.</v>

187
00:10:07.490 --> 00:10:09.620
