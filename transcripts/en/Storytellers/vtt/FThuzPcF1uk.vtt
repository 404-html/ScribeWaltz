1
00:00:02.970 --> 00:00:06.200
<v Speaker 1>So after having recently watched Black</v>
<v Speaker 1>Mirror,</v>

2
00:00:06.201 --> 00:00:09.810
<v Speaker 1>it struck me at the shows.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Most genuinely unsettling episodes don't</v>

3
00:00:09.811 --> 00:00:13.050
<v Speaker 1>just blatantly show a highly negative</v>
<v Speaker 1>dystopian future.</v>

4
00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:17.250
<v Speaker 1>Instead they take us for a ride and</v>
<v Speaker 1>reflect to us a vision of the future.</v>

5
00:00:17.251 --> 00:00:20.130
<v Speaker 1>Highly compatible with our own current</v>
<v Speaker 1>desires,</v>

6
00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:23.850
<v Speaker 1>the desires you capture,</v>
<v Speaker 1>share and hold onto the past.</v>

7
00:00:24.070 --> 00:00:27.860
<v Speaker 1>Because the way</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the entire history of you,</v>

8
00:00:27.861 --> 00:00:32.010
<v Speaker 1>this desire to hold onto our memories</v>
<v Speaker 1>has manifested itself in the grain.</v>

9
00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:36.270
<v Speaker 1>A device connected to our signups is</v>
<v Speaker 1>that records everything your eyes see.</v>

10
00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:40.560
<v Speaker 1>You can replay your recordings or your</v>
<v Speaker 1>reduce esther called at any given time,</v>

11
00:00:40.561 --> 00:00:44.140
<v Speaker 1>showed them to your friends and family</v>
<v Speaker 1>or hand them over to to forties when</v>

12
00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:45.690
<v Speaker 1>everyday.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So require you to,</v>

13
00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:47.940
<v Speaker 1>if you just really wanted me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I lost 24 hours.</v>

14
00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:51.570
<v Speaker 1>The story makes it abundantly clear that</v>
<v Speaker 1>the widespread integration of the grain</v>

15
00:00:51.571 --> 00:00:55.710
<v Speaker 1>in society has enormous implications for</v>
<v Speaker 1>the privacy of its characters.</v>

16
00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:59.140
<v Speaker 1>That's the room that many respects</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's lost nearly all of its meaning in</v>

17
00:00:59.141 --> 00:01:03.150
<v Speaker 1>a since been replaced rather by his</v>
<v Speaker 1>sentiment that can roughly be described</v>

18
00:01:03.151 --> 00:01:04.590
<v Speaker 1>us.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nothing to hide,</v>

19
00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:07.020
<v Speaker 1>nothing to fear.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We can see the implementation of this</v>

20
00:01:07.021 --> 00:01:09.150
<v Speaker 1>mindset right here and the airport</v>
<v Speaker 1>scene.</v>

21
00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:11.730
<v Speaker 1>The big thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just how or rally and the government has</v>

22
00:01:11.731 --> 00:01:15.780
<v Speaker 1>become in favor of its own security,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but we also see it manifested in the</v>

23
00:01:15.781 --> 00:01:19.050
<v Speaker 1>workplace as Liam's law firm demands</v>
<v Speaker 1>access to their employees,</v>

24
00:01:19.051 --> 00:01:21.510
<v Speaker 1>reduce in order to ensure their</v>
<v Speaker 1>productivity,</v>

25
00:01:21.511 --> 00:01:23.370
<v Speaker 1>loyalty,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and security for the image of the</v>

26
00:01:23.371 --> 00:01:25.440
<v Speaker 1>company.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And although the implementation of the</v>

27
00:01:25.441 --> 00:01:28.830
<v Speaker 1>grain has not been made mandatory,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's been highly normalized to the</v>

28
00:01:28.831 --> 00:01:32.730
<v Speaker 1>degree that grainless before stigmatized</v>
<v Speaker 1>as having something to hide and being</v>

29
00:01:32.731 --> 00:01:37.731
<v Speaker 1>degenerate,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is in turn supported by the fact</v>

30
00:01:38.911 --> 00:01:42.750
<v Speaker 1>that police won't respond to calls for</v>
<v Speaker 1>help from grainless citizens and why</v>

31
00:01:42.751 --> 00:01:45.660
<v Speaker 1>it's is promoted as being cheaper than a</v>
<v Speaker 1>cup of coffee.</v>

32
00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:49.410
<v Speaker 1>It's a power structure that at first</v>
<v Speaker 1>glance seems to benefit the forces in</v>

33
00:01:49.411 --> 00:01:51.910
<v Speaker 1>positions of power.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Calling back to Jeremy Bentham,</v>

34
00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:55.020
<v Speaker 1>Scott set with the Panopticon,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is a version of a rounded prison</v>

35
00:01:55.021 --> 00:01:58.050
<v Speaker 1>with a tower in the center in which a</v>
<v Speaker 1>guard could watch every individual</v>

36
00:01:58.051 --> 00:02:01.080
<v Speaker 1>prisoner at any time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the prisoners and dare turn could</v>

37
00:02:01.081 --> 00:02:04.050
<v Speaker 1>not see to guard and therefore would</v>
<v Speaker 1>never know whether they were being</v>

38
00:02:04.051 --> 00:02:06.780
<v Speaker 1>watched or not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if you're radically creating self</v>

39
00:02:06.781 --> 00:02:11.010
<v Speaker 1>disciplinary prisoners now to use this</v>
<v Speaker 1>concept as a metaphor in relation to our</v>

40
00:02:11.011 --> 00:02:14.510
<v Speaker 1>own society is as clear as day in</v>
<v Speaker 1>frankly somewhat on the nose.</v>

41
00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:16.920
<v Speaker 1>The big thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the dangers of unlimited surveillance</v>

42
00:02:16.921 --> 00:02:21.060
<v Speaker 1>and personal data mining and the lack of</v>
<v Speaker 1>balance between the watcher and watched</v>

43
00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:22.830
<v Speaker 1>the entire history of you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>however,</v>

44
00:02:22.831 --> 00:02:27.060
<v Speaker 1>shows in near future in which everyone</v>
<v Speaker 1>now effectively has inherited both those</v>

45
00:02:27.061 --> 00:02:29.610
<v Speaker 1>roles acting bove as a living,</v>
<v Speaker 1>breathing,</v>

46
00:02:29.611 --> 00:02:32.260
<v Speaker 1>CCTV camera,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your bitch.</v>

47
00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:36.510
<v Speaker 1>I'd like you to erase that as well as</v>
<v Speaker 1>the object passing through its frame.</v>

48
00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:40.350
<v Speaker 1>Not gonna hit anything to freak us out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How that they're not,</v>

49
00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:43.290
<v Speaker 1>there's no major deletions this quarter.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

50
00:02:43.291 --> 00:02:43.550
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

51
00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:47.050
<v Speaker 1>Everything's a well within prophetess.</v>
<v Speaker 1>However,</v>

52
00:02:47.070 --> 00:02:50.300
<v Speaker 1>it would be a mistake to conclude that</v>
<v Speaker 1>the green is merely a product of some</v>

53
00:02:50.301 --> 00:02:54.030
<v Speaker 1>level in police state as it seems to be</v>
<v Speaker 1>more of a natural outcome of years upon</v>

54
00:02:54.031 --> 00:02:58.680
<v Speaker 1>years of increasingly sharing our</v>
<v Speaker 1>personal lives from taking selfies to</v>

55
00:02:58.681 --> 00:03:02.200
<v Speaker 1>the recording of concerts to</v>
<v Speaker 1>lifestreaming your life for the entire</v>

56
00:03:02.201 --> 00:03:05.250
<v Speaker 1>world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>To see there never was a need to make</v>

57
00:03:05.270 --> 00:03:09.040
<v Speaker 1>grain mandatory because who wouldn't</v>
<v Speaker 1>want to share and relive the good old</v>

58
00:03:09.041 --> 00:03:12.880
<v Speaker 1>times during a nice reunion dinner.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And this is read the entire history of</v>

59
00:03:12.881 --> 00:03:17.460
<v Speaker 1>you shines the most by refraining from</v>
<v Speaker 1>focusing on the more obvious and already</v>

60
00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:21.550
<v Speaker 1>broadly covered bigger picture and</v>
<v Speaker 1>instead minimizing its aim onto what</v>

61
00:03:21.551 --> 00:03:25.270
<v Speaker 1>interests us most,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the personal and the coziness of a warm</v>

62
00:03:25.271 --> 00:03:28.990
<v Speaker 1>lead lid living room it relatable scene</v>
<v Speaker 1>showing nuance and it's social</v>

63
00:03:28.991 --> 00:03:33.991
<v Speaker 1>commentary making us comfortable before</v>
<v Speaker 1>ultimately showing its true ugly face</v>

64
00:03:36.130 --> 00:03:39.670
<v Speaker 1>during this painfully horrific scene at</v>
<v Speaker 1>both the state of Lehman fees,</v>

65
00:03:39.671 --> 00:03:43.480
<v Speaker 1>marriage becomes obvious as well as the</v>
<v Speaker 1>way in which degree in synthetically he</v>

66
00:03:43.481 --> 00:03:47.050
<v Speaker 1>keeps both of them stuck in the past,</v>
<v Speaker 1>completely disconnected from their</v>

67
00:03:47.051 --> 00:03:47.980
<v Speaker 1>present selves.</v>

68
00:03:48.010 --> 00:03:52.030
<v Speaker 1>Liam chosen to be the main focus of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>story functions as a prime example of</v>

69
00:03:52.031 --> 00:03:54.580
<v Speaker 1>this obsession.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We seed in his role as a litigation</v>

70
00:03:54.581 --> 00:03:59.440
<v Speaker 1>lawyer dealing solely with redo cases,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's also noticeable in a slight but</v>

71
00:03:59.441 --> 00:04:04.210
<v Speaker 1>consistent social awkwardness seemingly</v>
<v Speaker 1>never being really present to the moment</v>

72
00:04:04.240 --> 00:04:08.470
<v Speaker 1>using reduced to remember the name of</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of his wife's best friends because</v>

73
00:04:08.471 --> 00:04:10.930
<v Speaker 1>who needs an actual memory when you have</v>
<v Speaker 1>to grain.</v>

74
00:04:11.290 --> 00:04:14.860
<v Speaker 1>But where it's most evident is in is</v>
<v Speaker 1>mistrust of his wife's faithfulness.</v>

75
00:04:15.100 --> 00:04:17.500
<v Speaker 1>Starting from the moment he sees her</v>
<v Speaker 1>chatting with Jonas,</v>

76
00:04:17.501 --> 00:04:20.500
<v Speaker 1>he rapidly descends into a full blown</v>
<v Speaker 1>paranoia,</v>

77
00:04:20.860 --> 00:04:24.100
<v Speaker 1>effectively prosecuting his wife using</v>
<v Speaker 1>evidence from years ago.</v>

78
00:04:25.970 --> 00:04:30.900
<v Speaker 1>So when week or a month as lean tries to</v>
<v Speaker 1>drink away and perhaps indulge into</v>

79
00:04:30.910 --> 00:04:32.860
<v Speaker 1>pain,</v>
<v Speaker 1>has investigation is causing him.</v>

80
00:04:32.861 --> 00:04:37.000
<v Speaker 1>We noticed that this might very well be</v>
<v Speaker 1>his share behavior seen in friends,</v>

81
00:04:37.001 --> 00:04:39.220
<v Speaker 1>family,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and even the work environment.</v>

82
00:04:39.580 --> 00:04:42.100
<v Speaker 1>And it's really no wonder that the</v>
<v Speaker 1>indulgence of these mind numbing</v>

83
00:04:42.101 --> 00:04:46.120
<v Speaker 1>substances plays such a prevalent role</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the society as various mirror shots</v>

84
00:04:46.121 --> 00:04:49.780
<v Speaker 1>indicate how the grain has caused part</v>
<v Speaker 1>of Liam's personality to split,</v>

85
00:04:50.290 --> 00:04:52.600
<v Speaker 1>to stay behind,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they has been time,</v>

86
00:04:52.660 --> 00:04:56.650
<v Speaker 1>but it has been timed that can never be</v>
<v Speaker 1>automatically let go off and it has the</v>

87
00:04:56.651 --> 00:04:59.860
<v Speaker 1>potential to come crashing down on you</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you're not paying attention.</v>

88
00:05:00.070 --> 00:05:02.500
<v Speaker 1>Liam,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the end forces his wife to expose him</v>

89
00:05:02.501 --> 00:05:05.620
<v Speaker 1>to the truth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the most visceral way imaginable is</v>

90
00:05:05.621 --> 00:05:09.160
<v Speaker 1>marriage now in ruins.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He ponders about better times rewinding</v>

91
00:05:09.161 --> 00:05:12.610
<v Speaker 1>them and perhaps wishing he had really</v>
<v Speaker 1>lift those moments when they were still</v>

92
00:05:12.611 --> 00:05:14.710
<v Speaker 1>real.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And even though he turned out to be</v>

93
00:05:14.711 --> 00:05:18.400
<v Speaker 1>right in this obsessive paranoia,</v>
<v Speaker 1>seeing how Lehman fear almost always</v>

94
00:05:18.401 --> 00:05:21.580
<v Speaker 1>shown apart from each other,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one can only wonder what it was this</v>

95
00:05:21.581 --> 00:05:25.000
<v Speaker 1>brokenness to over analyze,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to live in the past rather than in the</v>

96
00:05:25.001 --> 00:05:27.310
<v Speaker 1>present.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That caused a rift in our marriage long</v>

97
00:05:27.311 --> 00:05:30.760
<v Speaker 1>before the event's shown on screen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So obsessed.</v>

98
00:05:31.930 --> 00:05:35.870
<v Speaker 1>I'm not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the end,</v>

99
00:05:35.890 --> 00:05:38.890
<v Speaker 1>Leah knows that having a grain will</v>
<v Speaker 1>never allow him to move on,</v>

100
00:05:39.100 --> 00:05:42.790
<v Speaker 1>that it would always keep him a prisoner</v>
<v Speaker 1>of his own mind and it's at that point</v>

101
00:05:42.791 --> 00:05:46.690
<v Speaker 1>and he realizes that the only way he</v>
<v Speaker 1>will ever escape this vicious cycle is</v>

102
00:05:46.691 --> 00:05:49.150
<v Speaker 1>to literally cut off that that would</v>
<v Speaker 1>have the past.</v>

103
00:05:49.151 --> 00:05:49.370
<v Speaker 1>And</v>

104
00:05:49.370 --> 00:05:51.410
<v Speaker 2>finally coming back into the now.</v>

105
00:05:59.210 --> 00:06:02.420
<v Speaker 3>That concludes this video essay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Thank you all so much for watching.</v>

<v Speaker 3>I will drop my additional video</v>
<v Speaker 3>commentary for this video essay on our</v>

109
00:06:13.281 --> 00:06:16.070
<v Speaker 3>patrion page.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think the entire history view is one</v>

110
00:06:16.071 --> 00:06:18.170
<v Speaker 3>off,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if not the best black mirror episode to</v>

111
00:06:18.171 --> 00:06:20.500
<v Speaker 3>date.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I hope I showed you why exactly it</v>

112
00:06:20.510 --> 00:06:22.420
<v Speaker 3>is in this video.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

113
00:06:22.450 --> 00:06:23.750
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think that's it for today.</v>

114
00:06:23.790 --> 00:06:27.170
<v Speaker 3>Would you consider following us on</v>
<v Speaker 3>facebook and maybe twitter as we do</v>
