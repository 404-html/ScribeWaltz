<v Speaker 1>Thanks to squarespace for sponsoring</v>

<v Speaker 1>start your free trial and now we're to</v>
<v Speaker 1>link in the description below</v>

3
00:00:14.420 --> 00:00:17.960
<v Speaker 1>in the short video essay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want to explore a contradiction I</v>

4
00:00:17.961 --> 00:00:22.070
<v Speaker 1>noticed when we watching two excellent</v>
<v Speaker 1>film centered around American slavery,</v>

5
00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:26.960
<v Speaker 1>12 years a slave and Django unchained,</v>
<v Speaker 1>12 years a slave of course tells the</v>

6
00:00:26.961 --> 00:00:30.350
<v Speaker 1>true story of Solomon Northup Free New</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yorker,</v>

7
00:00:30.351 --> 00:00:34.930
<v Speaker 1>who is abducted and sold into slavery</v>
<v Speaker 1>for 12 years before is fried.</v>

8
00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:37.940
<v Speaker 1>Now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Twelve years of slave is a heavy drama</v>

9
00:00:37.941 --> 00:00:40.820
<v Speaker 1>that carries the full weight of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>horror of slavery.</v>

10
00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:42.140
<v Speaker 1>Django unchained,</v>
<v Speaker 1>however,</v>

11
00:00:42.141 --> 00:00:46.460
<v Speaker 1>is in many ways the total opposite.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't see fucking shit outage.</v>

12
00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:50.030
<v Speaker 1>We ready or what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

13
00:00:50.031 --> 00:00:53.750
<v Speaker 1>hold on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not going with my whole Django</v>

14
00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:57.830
<v Speaker 1>definitely has moments where the horrors</v>
<v Speaker 1>of slavery are conveyed through brutal</v>

15
00:00:57.831 --> 00:01:00.890
<v Speaker 1>and difficult scenes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yet it is also a term Tino film</v>

16
00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:04.340
<v Speaker 1>featuring violence as spectacle and a</v>
<v Speaker 1>big dose of comedy.</v>

17
00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:07.140
<v Speaker 1>I said Ms Dot Lowe,</v>
<v Speaker 1>goodbye,</v>

18
00:01:08.940 --> 00:01:13.940
<v Speaker 1>but</v>
<v Speaker 1>this created as is not uncommon with</v>

19
00:01:14.691 --> 00:01:16.370
<v Speaker 1>county,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no controversy.</v>

20
00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:19.490
<v Speaker 1>Media scholar,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Glenda Carpio notes that the discourse</v>

21
00:01:19.491 --> 00:01:23.450
<v Speaker 1>of race and slavery in America has</v>
<v Speaker 1>mostly gravitated towards steep</v>

22
00:01:23.451 --> 00:01:26.660
<v Speaker 1>seriousness and sensitivity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Django unchained,</v>

23
00:01:26.661 --> 00:01:30.860
<v Speaker 1>therefore raise the question if certain</v>
<v Speaker 1>film genres such as Komani are</v>

24
00:01:30.861 --> 00:01:34.100
<v Speaker 1>inherently inadequate for capturing the</v>
<v Speaker 1>history of slavery,</v>

25
00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:38.210
<v Speaker 1>can turn and be forgiven for not</v>
<v Speaker 1>adhering to historical accuracy,</v>

26
00:01:38.211 --> 00:01:42.080
<v Speaker 1>but it's not be forgiven for striking</v>
<v Speaker 1>the quote unquote wrong tone,</v>

27
00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:45.050
<v Speaker 1>addressing such a sensitive subject,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Michelle,</v>

28
00:01:45.051 --> 00:01:49.760
<v Speaker 1>to load the this discussion as well of</v>
<v Speaker 1>historical authenticity instead of</v>

29
00:01:49.761 --> 00:01:54.761
<v Speaker 1>historical accuracy as he argues is not</v>
<v Speaker 1>only the your executive dudes over stoke</v>

30
00:01:54.971 --> 00:01:58.490
<v Speaker 1>or representation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but also the context of its consumption</v>

31
00:01:58.491 --> 00:02:03.230
<v Speaker 1>that's determines its meaning.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Critics of Django this argued that its</v>

32
00:02:03.231 --> 00:02:07.760
<v Speaker 1>approach of humor and filing spectacle</v>
<v Speaker 1>hurts and trivializes not only the</v>

33
00:02:07.761 --> 00:02:11.120
<v Speaker 1>memory of slavery,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but also institutional racism that</v>

34
00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:15.560
<v Speaker 1>fullerton under Jim Crow and the</v>
<v Speaker 1>discussion about racism and race that is</v>

35
00:02:15.561 --> 00:02:17.840
<v Speaker 1>prevalent in American society today.</v>

36
00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:20.630
<v Speaker 1>I would argue though that this is</v>
<v Speaker 1>untrue,</v>

37
00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:24.490
<v Speaker 1>the different tonal style stanton,</v>
<v Speaker 1>new uses in Jenga and change each shift</v>

38
00:02:24.491 --> 00:02:28.040
<v Speaker 1>to own function.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In my analysis of inglorious bastards,</v>

39
00:02:28.041 --> 00:02:32.890
<v Speaker 1>I discussed how Terentino's violence,</v>
<v Speaker 1>both s entertaining spectacle and as</v>

40
00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:35.810
<v Speaker 1>something brutal and horrific as,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

41
00:02:35.811 --> 00:02:39.620
<v Speaker 1>white crackers pointed out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he does the same in Django and chains to</v>

42
00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:41.870
<v Speaker 1>violence against black slaves,</v>
<v Speaker 1>his crew,</v>

43
00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:45.500
<v Speaker 1>horrific and hard to watch.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just as in 12 years a slave.</v>

44
00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:49.070
<v Speaker 1>It drives home the horrible and gruesome</v>
<v Speaker 1>history of slavery.</v>

45
00:02:49.490 --> 00:02:53.120
<v Speaker 1>Terentino's reserves is useful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Filings as spectacle and fun for the</v>

46
00:02:53.121 --> 00:02:57.680
<v Speaker 1>slave holders and other characters who</v>
<v Speaker 1>represent the ideology of racism and</v>

47
00:02:57.681 --> 00:02:58.514
<v Speaker 1>slavery.</v>

48
00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:17.730
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I find Terentino's use a few more of the</v>

49
00:03:17.731 --> 00:03:19.890
<v Speaker 1>most interesting tonal aspect of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>film.</v>

50
00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:22.470
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's Terentino's I think realizes is</v>

51
00:03:22.471 --> 00:03:24.960
<v Speaker 1>that humor does not affect trivialize</v>
<v Speaker 1>slavery,</v>

52
00:03:24.961 --> 00:03:28.050
<v Speaker 1>birth and it has the capacity to</v>
<v Speaker 1>ridicule and it's been a ride.</v>

53
00:03:28.051 --> 00:03:30.150
<v Speaker 1>I log that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uphold slavery,</v>

54
00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:33.690
<v Speaker 1>taking away its power and providing a</v>
<v Speaker 1>form of Catharsis.</v>

55
00:03:34.290 --> 00:03:37.570
<v Speaker 1>My name is Dr King Schults.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is my triangle.</v>

56
00:03:38.110 --> 00:03:43.110
<v Speaker 1>These our horses totally fits.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This power of comedy is also recognized</v>

57
00:03:44.881 --> 00:03:49.470
<v Speaker 1>by a comedian such as key and peele and</v>
<v Speaker 1>Dave Chappelle who also ridicule and</v>

58
00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:52.860
<v Speaker 1>make fun of the ideology of slavery.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not to trivialize it,</v>

59
00:03:52.910 --> 00:03:56.670
<v Speaker 1>but to take away its power.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Examples of this are seen in Django</v>

60
00:03:56.671 --> 00:04:01.230
<v Speaker 1>unchained where supposedly terrifying</v>
<v Speaker 1>clan rate is juxtaposed with ridiculous</v>

61
00:04:01.231 --> 00:04:04.260
<v Speaker 1>discussion about being unable to see two</v>
<v Speaker 1>white bags.</v>

62
00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:05.730
<v Speaker 2>Fuck all y'all.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hold on.</v>

63
00:04:05.790 --> 00:04:07.120
<v Speaker 2>Going on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

64
00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:08.850
<v Speaker 2>I watched my wife work.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

65
00:04:08.860 --> 00:04:11.460
<v Speaker 2>day.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Get 30 bags together for you.</v>

66
00:04:11.520 --> 00:04:15.090
<v Speaker 2>Ungrateful Sons of bitches and all.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've been here to criticize,</v>

67
00:04:15.150 --> 00:04:16.590
<v Speaker 2>criticize,</v>
<v Speaker 2>criticize.</v>

68
00:04:18.240 --> 00:04:19.880
<v Speaker 2>Don't ask me for nothing</v>

69
00:04:21.210 --> 00:04:25.320
<v Speaker 1>or key and peele skits were two slaves.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Feel rejected when they are not being</v>

70
00:04:25.321 --> 00:04:26.820
<v Speaker 1>bought during the slave auction.</v>

71
00:04:27.280 --> 00:04:31.690
<v Speaker 2>It's all chins over.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It ain't over.</v>

72
00:04:31.720 --> 00:04:34.180
<v Speaker 2>It's not over.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm strong y'all.</v>

73
00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:36.070
<v Speaker 2>I'm very shy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can sleep in a bucket.</v>

74
00:04:36.130 --> 00:04:37.550
<v Speaker 2>I'm fast.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I got stamina.</v>

75
00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:39.220
<v Speaker 2>I don't look at.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know magic.</v>

76
00:04:39.250 --> 00:04:41.200
<v Speaker 2>My worst quality is that I'm a</v>
<v Speaker 2>perfectionist.</v>

77
00:04:41.290 --> 00:04:43.030
<v Speaker 2>I haven't mentioned this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Dust Silent.</v>

78
00:04:43.690 --> 00:04:46.000
<v Speaker 2>I am agreeable to a fault.</v>

79
00:04:46.660 --> 00:04:50.530
<v Speaker 1>There was also a striking similarity</v>
<v Speaker 1>between the scene where Django shoots,</v>

80
00:04:50.600 --> 00:04:52.840
<v Speaker 1>slave master,</v>
<v Speaker 1>slave,</v>

81
00:04:52.870 --> 00:04:57.460
<v Speaker 1>and Dave Chappelle skit where he travels</v>
<v Speaker 1>back in time to confront a slave owner.</v>

82
00:04:57.540 --> 00:05:01.820
<v Speaker 2>He had made lanes and even get new shoes</v>
<v Speaker 2>on deck.</v>

83
00:05:02.780 --> 00:05:05.720
<v Speaker 2>I could never go out like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you really free.</v>

84
00:05:05.950 --> 00:05:07.010
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's true.</v>

85
00:05:09.130 --> 00:05:10.610
<v Speaker 2>He didn't pull it out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A whip.</v>

86
00:05:11.270 --> 00:05:15.020
<v Speaker 2>Nice whip.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's there's a pistol.</v>

87
00:05:16.010 --> 00:05:17.840
<v Speaker 2>Reach Foolish Guy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hungry.</v>

88
00:05:20.950 --> 00:05:21.783
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

89
00:05:37.620 --> 00:05:39.780
<v Speaker 1>that's Glenda Carpio.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Rq spoke,</v>

90
00:05:39.790 --> 00:05:44.500
<v Speaker 1>Chappelle and Tino use their mediums to</v>
<v Speaker 1>affect scenes of retribution against</v>

91
00:05:44.501 --> 00:05:47.350
<v Speaker 1>slavery.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Using humor to boats sharpened the edge</v>

92
00:05:47.370 --> 00:05:52.370
<v Speaker 1>if that ritual and to highlight the</v>
<v Speaker 1>artificiality of representations in my</v>

93
00:05:52.420 --> 00:05:55.830
<v Speaker 1>few boats.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Twelve years of slave and Django and are</v>

94
00:05:55.840 --> 00:05:58.550
<v Speaker 1>excellent films.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Birth Django unchained should not be</v>

95
00:05:58.551 --> 00:06:03.290
<v Speaker 1>criticized for its use of humor around</v>
<v Speaker 1>sensitive subjects to slavery and race.</v>

96
00:06:03.350 --> 00:06:07.820
<v Speaker 1>To do so would be for guests to healing</v>
<v Speaker 1>qualities that comedy can have.</v>

97
00:06:10.010 --> 00:06:12.410
<v Speaker 1>All</v>

99
00:06:15.081 --> 00:06:18.980

<v Speaker 1>essay about power that's company can</v>

100
00:06:18.981 --> 00:06:23.060
<v Speaker 1>have in discussing difficult subjects,</v>
<v Speaker 1>something that seems to be forgotten</v>

00:06:23.061 --> 00:06:25.030
<v Speaker 1>more and more these days.</v>
