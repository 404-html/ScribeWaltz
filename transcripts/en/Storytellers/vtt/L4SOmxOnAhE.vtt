15
00:01:18.121 --> 00:01:20.760
<v Speaker 1>of us,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the destructive and self destructive</v>

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:29.930
<v Speaker 2>She was diy in one time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You the fuck you on a Sunday morning to</v>

19
00:01:29.931 --> 00:01:33.230
<v Speaker 2>sitting on the couch watching my numbing</v>
<v Speaker 2>spit at Kachin game shorts,</v>

20
00:01:33.470 --> 00:01:36.470
<v Speaker 2>stuffing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>fucking jumped for it and I chose not to</v>

21
00:01:36.471 --> 00:01:40.190
<v Speaker 2>choose life.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I choose something else and the reasons,</v>

22
00:01:41.730 --> 00:01:45.980
<v Speaker 2>but I'm the reasons.</v>
<v Speaker 2>These reasons when you've got hat on,</v>

23
00:01:46.750 --> 00:01:50.430
<v Speaker 1>we are all aware of the mundanity,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your flavor of [inaudible].</v>

24
00:01:50.550 --> 00:01:55.150
<v Speaker 1>What can I get stuck in the boring daily</v>
<v Speaker 1>responsibilities while it has to attend</v>

25
00:01:55.151 --> 00:01:59.470
<v Speaker 1>to choose cleaning your house too is</v>
<v Speaker 1>doing Texas two is going through the</v>

26
00:01:59.471 --> 00:02:03.490
<v Speaker 1>same job every day from nine to five but</v>
<v Speaker 1>why would you choose that?</v>

27
00:02:03.730 --> 00:02:06.760
<v Speaker 1>Why not just choose pleasure,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially if the pleasure.</v>

28
00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:11.210
<v Speaker 2>Take the backstory guys,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm you ever had multiply it by 2000 and</v>

29
00:02:11.211 --> 00:02:12.860
<v Speaker 2>there still are nowhere near it.</v>

30
00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:17.380
<v Speaker 1>Rent and then his friends therefore find</v>
<v Speaker 1>themselves in a similar position as I</v>

31
00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:18.670
<v Speaker 1>argued,</v>
<v Speaker 1>similar dosing,</v>

32
00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:21.960
<v Speaker 1>the lion king,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the position of choosing escapism that</v>

33
00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:26.650
<v Speaker 1>pleasure over adopting responsibility.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Birth where Simba chooses eating bugs,</v>

34
00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:31.610
<v Speaker 1>relaxing and singing over reclaiming his</v>
<v Speaker 1>kingdom rent and his friends to a darker</v>

35
00:02:31.611 --> 00:02:36.370
<v Speaker 1>and more destructive substance in order</v>
<v Speaker 1>to escape the boring identity of normal,</v>

36
00:02:36.371 --> 00:02:40.900
<v Speaker 1>lower to middle class life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The film then exposes another hypocrisy</v>

37
00:02:40.901 --> 00:02:43.300
<v Speaker 1>about looking down on the heroin</v>
<v Speaker 1>addiction</v>

38
00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:46.300
<v Speaker 2>without poisoned my body.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Whether I should.</v>

<v Speaker 2>move fucking weed.</v>

40
00:02:55.410 --> 00:02:59.740
<v Speaker 2>It's always the life mine.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is it in your body but shaped</v>

41
00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:04.600
<v Speaker 1>cause own to all addicted to something.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Does it really make any difference if we</v>

42
00:03:04.601 --> 00:03:08.440
<v Speaker 1>choose heroin or if you choose alcohol,</v>
<v Speaker 1>violence or smoking?</v>

43
00:03:08.710 --> 00:03:11.260
<v Speaker 1>If we choose benching,</v>
<v Speaker 1>television and movies,</v>

44
00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:12.760
<v Speaker 1>instagram or twitter,</v>

<v Speaker 3>instagram and oppose and other ways to</v>

47
00:03:18.031 --> 00:03:20.500
<v Speaker 3>spew your bail cross.</v>
<v Speaker 3>People you've never met.</v>

48
00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:23.860
<v Speaker 3>Choose updating your profile.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Tell the world what you had for</v>

49
00:03:23.861 --> 00:03:26.680
<v Speaker 3>breakfast and hope that someone</v>
<v Speaker 3>somewhere cares.</v>

50
00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:29.730
<v Speaker 1>The answer to transplanting a guesthouse</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that yes,</v>

51
00:03:29.790 --> 00:03:32.880
<v Speaker 1>it does make a difference cause just as</v>
<v Speaker 1>rent and says,</v>

52
00:03:33.010 --> 00:03:36.160
<v Speaker 2>this was to be my final head,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but let's be clear by this.</v>

53
00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:39.100
<v Speaker 2>That's final pets and final heads</v>

54
00:03:39.310 --> 00:03:41.800
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Our addictions and our addictions.</v>

55
00:03:42.010 --> 00:03:46.060
<v Speaker 1>Maybe you are all escaping something</v>
<v Speaker 1>trying to fill a void because although</v>

56
00:03:46.061 --> 00:03:48.460
<v Speaker 1>good addiction can do that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the ones we choose,</v>

57
00:03:48.461 --> 00:03:51.260
<v Speaker 1>we will have an impact on our lives.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There are addictions,</v>

58
00:03:51.290 --> 00:03:56.200
<v Speaker 1>there's will bring us up addictions that</v>
<v Speaker 1>will bring us down slowly and addictions</v>

59
00:03:56.201 --> 00:04:00.250
<v Speaker 1>that he'll bring us down.</v>
<v Speaker 1>False drove to film the pleasure of how</v>

60
00:04:00.420 --> 00:04:03.640
<v Speaker 1>to escape the boredom and identity and</v>
<v Speaker 1>the harshness of life.</v>

61
00:04:03.641 --> 00:04:07.300
<v Speaker 1>Seeing strengthen,</v>
<v Speaker 1>deepen hell almost destroying himself</v>

62
00:04:07.360 --> 00:04:11.020
<v Speaker 1>and everything around him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The ending of the film then leaves us</v>

63
00:04:11.021 --> 00:04:14.440
<v Speaker 1>with this message.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It is better to choose to responsibility</v>

64
00:04:14.441 --> 00:04:18.880
<v Speaker 1>often normal mundane life than to seek</v>
<v Speaker 1>further into the hell that escape</v>

65
00:04:18.881 --> 00:04:20.200
<v Speaker 1>displeasure creates.</v>

<v Speaker 1>but it is not the solution and this is</v>
<v Speaker 1>what the secret of transporting tea two</v>

<v Speaker 1>offers to me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What makes this film that was critiques</v>

78
00:04:59.721 --> 00:05:04.240
<v Speaker 1>for Wallowing in its own nostalgia.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A brilliant film is that it's complete</v>

79
00:05:04.250 --> 00:05:07.730
<v Speaker 1>so question not fully answered by the</v>
<v Speaker 1>original cause.</v>

<v Speaker 1>was experiencing the lesson in this</v>
<v Speaker 1>nostalgic film.</v>
