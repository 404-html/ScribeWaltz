Speaker 1:          00:00          Thank you to squarespace for sponsoring this video for as long as we know the existence of border walls and boundaries have gone hand in hand with the development of civilization and the human experience as a whole and the evilness 2015 film sicario disorder manifests itself in the physical fence, separating cartel infested Mexico from the United States. However, the violence and chaos of the neighboring country is slowly but surely creeping its way into the backyard of the American society, unseen by most yet visible and ever grown to dos who know where to look. Kate Macer as part of an FBI getting that response unit that's been engaged in cleaning up the mess of this ever expanding problem in a lot of ways. Her story is similar to that of Keller Dover from Vilnius, prisoners, kate or Macer to her colleagues is again a character with a strong moral compass and a principle belief system as a strict agent of order and the law she believes in speaking the truth without question the statement, what do you want me to stay to work the truth with our last name?

Speaker 1:          01:07          Appropriately reflecting her disposition as a strong representative of justice and the law and liked the inciting incident of the illness, kidnapping mystery. It is a southern and unexpectedly malevolent event that kickstarts the protagonist journey into a confusing, morally chaotic world where her belief system will be tested and blur to its core. Just traumatic event push escapes. You volunteer for a task force led by the ambiguous and unconventional Matt Graves with a mission devil take her to the border of a country as well as the boundary of her own lawful world. According to Jonathan, the archetype of the board are commonly symbolizes the world at the limit, a place at the bottom, and at the margin. It's a symbol of a place in the periphery that protects the order of the center from the chaos of the unknown, but it's often also a realm Verdi's. Two categories meet and become interlinked and where it a difference between the two isn't always obvious and thus it's a place where to garden. Heroes tend to be shown as hybrid beings of sorts. Possessing elements from both sides of the border for Matt and his team working in between the lines of the law is the only way to effectively protect the center. Matt is shown to be both a representative of order as well as an agent of chaos.

Speaker 2:          02:23          Doing here is you're giving us the opportunity to shake the tree, create chaos. That's what it is.

Speaker 1:          02:28          There's moral hybridity is further depicted through aerial shots of the boarder landscape with it's beige colors and rugged terrain, promoting descents of moral ambiguity. Kate being an emissary of law and order with the illuminating light of moral truth shining onto her, goes into the unknown. Unprepared and ill equipped attempting to stay within the confines of the law, but ultimately being unable to keep the chaos from invading her world. Symbolical level of Kate's initial vision of our journey starts off fairly archetypical. The cartels did devils that threatened to order and harmony of the center or seem to be infiltrating ever deeper into the country. To restore this order and bring those responsible to justice, she has to descend into chaos, into the layer of the snake or the Cave of the beast. This beast initially become strongly identified with the violence of the cartels in general, and the city of chorus in particular

Speaker 3:          03:21          is obese.

Speaker 1:          03:24          However, her fellow task force members seemed to be participating and even reveling in the lawlessness of the city.

Speaker 3:          03:30          Brilliant what they do when they mutilated body like that.

Speaker 1:          03:35          As a representative of the law. Kate's presence then begins to put an increasing amount of physical and mental pressure on her conscience as she quickly picks up smoking to cope with this new reality. This evolution is mirrored by the character of Sylvio, serving as a cautionary tale for Kate Sylvio is her Mexican counterpart in law enforcement, a godly man, and a father of a son who is desperately trying to keep away from the chaos of the outside world as much as possible. No. However, it's revealed that Sylvia has been corrupted by the cartel and is quite obviously struggling with this reality as he's often framed in a shadow smoking cigarettes by the dozens and using alcohol to set up a barrier for his own conscience, but whereas Sylvia's principals have already been sacrificed, skate is showing you still be fighting for hers. Yeah, that was fucking illegal. You want to start a war, but it's not long thereafter that she to realize is that the order she represents has been turning a blind eye to the activities of maths, hybrid heroes. So if your fear is operating out of bounds, I am telling you you are not.

Speaker 1:          04:41          Boundaries been moved. This granting or permission by Kate Superior symbolizes the archetype of the wise skiing or fodder culture, turning a blind eye or being naive or oblivious due to dealing with chaotic, tyrannical, broader or advisor, and it's this looking away that allows for the boundary of operational procedures to be shifted across the border and it has a helping hand and blurring the boundaries of order and chaos and that represents gates own or change in her world view. Pivotal in this individual shift of boundaries are to characters of Reggie and Alejandro. Reggie is shown to be kate's most trusted friend into force and symbolizes every aspect of kate that aligns with truth, law and order, and it's precisely because of this that Matt does not want him on his team. Reggie functions as irrational moral guide of order for Kate always seeing dressed in blue and guiding k to seek the truth and state in line with the code of law

Speaker 3:          05:36          cake, but you don't have to do this.

Speaker 1:          05:40          Alejandro on the other hand is somewhat of the polar opposite of Reggie being driven by strong emotional feelings of hatred. The former prosecutor turned lawless, hitman works for anyone who will set him loose on the people who killed his wife and daughter. Alejandro is an agent of chaos, a mysterious man. A few words often seen shrouded by darkness, but ever present in the background. He is a man who seems to have lost most of his humanity along the way, either being referred to bias John Wick like nickname or as an animal or fencing, and even a Frankenstein monster or emissary of the devil as he sets his sights on Fausto, all our con, the man responsible for the destruction of his family appropriately named effort go to faust, a man who has sold his soul to the devil and who ultimately has to face the consequences.

Speaker 1:          06:32          Both these two characters influenced gate and seem to function as agents of order and chaos respectively, both from the real world as well as symbolically indicates own internal world. We can see how Reggie's influence over gate starts to dwindle as he unknowingly sets her up with her would be hitman with our orderly site, blinded. It's only fitting then at. Alondra appears over her like a shadow just at the right time. After this moment, it is Alejandro who moves into the foreground and takes on a role as her guardian. This unconscious shift into chaos can also be seen in Kate's increasing lack of personal hygiene, and it's a shift that comes to a climax in the mace, like layer of the beast, both Reggie and all 100 venture into different paths and although Reggie orders k to stay behind him, she chooses to follow 100 instead and it's here at the center of the maze that she discovers that her supposed to protect her and her and Zack agonist are one and the same and ironically it's in her personal mission to tame chaos back into order that she herself is the one who was brought to her knees in the end to perceive archetypal narrative of the hero slaying the beast who terrorizes the land is then suddenly subverted by a story more akin to that of the garden of Eden cade wanting to deal with the increasing infestation of chaos as a representative of order was unknowingly lured into tigray world of the periphery.

Speaker 1:          07:58          Tempted by the potential outcome of finally dealing with the layer of the snake to goodbye from the apple. Only to realize that dealing with one snake would only allow for another to rise to power.

Speaker 1:          08:14          In the end, she's left shrouded from the light that had one shine onto her having been made conscious overall mortality and fragility as well as that of the order she serves. Alejandro forces her to finally sign away her principles, the last holdout for the boundary that is now collapsing all around her and escaped his left, broken and alone. A new force moves into the foreground emerging as a representative of chaos. Alejandro replaces the core stuff. The father who's death has just been signed and echoes in a new era in which the boundaries of the order of law have no place.
