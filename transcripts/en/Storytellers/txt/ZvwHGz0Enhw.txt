Speaker 1:          00:12          So a question. I think that's many people have been asking themselves more and more in the last 15 years. How could this all happen? We live in an information age where government and corporations have more access to personal information than ever before. There's a constant debate between privacy and safety instead of

Speaker 2:          00:31          people to follow you. We use the devices that you paid for the services and the systems that surround you invisibly every day to watch you on our behalf.

Speaker 1:          00:42          So why are so much, there was a tech slipping through the cracks of our counter terrorism and intelligence agencies. I think it's interesting to look at a few of counterterrorism ans Howard might be influenced by the films and series to watch. An important aspect or film analysis is to look at our films and series are not only shaped by culture, history, and politics, but also how they influence these things. As media scholar j Belton status myth has to become part of the cultural language by which America on the stance itself and popular films serve as a barometer of contemporary political history. Examples of this regarding our historic on standing our movies such as saving private Ryan and the gladiator.

Speaker 2:          01:25          You're

Speaker 1:          01:28          these films definitely shape and influence our fuse of this historical time periods. Looking at current issues of counterterrorism, it would be logical to assume that since everything is filmed and documents, we can easily see the differences between the reality of these issues and its representation in fiction, but I would argue it's not that simple.

Speaker 3:          01:47          I want all his phones. It's blackberry, the apartment, his car, bank accounts, credit cards, travel patterns. I want to know what he's going to think before he does every dirty little secret he has and most of all we want the name and real time location of his source. This is NSA priority level for any questions.

Speaker 2:          02:07          All right, let's get to it.

Speaker 1:          02:09          That seems to be more and more distrust towards the information presented by the government and to news organizations and the workings of intelligence agencies are clouded in secrecy. So if you don't feel we're an accurate view of the workings of counter terrorism, then it is important to look at my films and series represented in a certain way. And how does busbee be shapes our understanding in the words or bad baritones popularity off contemporary conspiracy films represent a hunger for explanatory narrative of global terrorism and counterterrorism in 24 every season there's a new terrorist threat that check bower with the help of chloe and the counter terrorist unit or CPU needs to prevent a reoccurring aspect off 24 is the use of torture to gain critical information to prevent an attack.

Speaker 2:          02:54          You gotta tell me what I want to know what you're going to start losing your fingers one by one

Speaker 1:          03:00          last chance. This often proves successful. Devastating. That's torture is legitimate strategy to counter terrorist threats. Jack, what if this doesn't work? I'm never fell in pharmaceutical torture. All that effect. And I have it turned out that the dean of the US Military Academy at westpoint stated that the series was to direct costs for wrongful behavioral few as troops in Iraq. Of course, in those years to a few years of torture became a nationwide debate and newer films and shows half adopted a different perspective on it.

Speaker 4:          03:40          Okay. Okay.

Speaker 1:          03:56          Another interesting aspect is that within 24 and other films are serious that deal with terrorism, although to terrorist threats come from a wide range or groups and nationalities, Chinese radical Muslims, Russians. There's almost always an aspect of internal betrayal by people within the agencies. The born shaves even flips it around and test the horse. CIS grew up with just one person that is trying to restore its integrity. This of course does represent and reinforced the public distrust in government and the agencies and ends when we've won. The last aspect that I want to discuss is the representation of the abilities of these intelligence agencies. In many films and series and especially the born serious disabilities are highly overrated as and states insofar as counter intelligence narratives utilize pseudo expert jargon and mucked up technical imagery to provide an illusion of scientific accuracy and sophistication. They reframed the mundane limitations off rewards environments as technological fantasies in the bone or the made them. For example, the CIA headquarters can easily switch from a macro view of Europe to a CCTV stream of a particular street. In reality, the technology and possibilities are much more limited. For one, it's not so easy to switch between various systems and a big problem according to Christopher Andrew's book on secret intelligence is sifting through massive amounts of collected data yet and the Bourne ultimatum. They seem to hear and see everything instantly.

Speaker 5:          05:23          Hey, on, I'm on black Friday with pete black prior looks like it's coming from a European signal.

Speaker 1:          05:30          As he says. Even with good intelligence, we can foresee the future only s Saint Paul claims heaven to dark and the story of glass. I would say that although intelligence technology is becoming more financed and the debate about privacy is definitely worth having, governments don't have the optical few of the whole world that they can access anytime they want.

Speaker 5:          05:50          This vast collection of data is not that useful and infringes a substantially on personal privacy

Speaker 1:          05:58          should be aware of how our perception could be partially shaped by popular culture because although these films and cvs have to create a freedom of fiction is to distrust in government, gross, the burden off reality may become the responsibility or fiction. My name is Edward Snowden.

Speaker 1:          06:18          All right. Thank you so much for watching. Uh, the last two weeks we've got some awesome exposure and you gave us all amazing feedback. Uh, I'm working on my voice and we'll try to improve it a little bit. Every video we are also working hard on sound mixing and of course our skillsets altogether. Uh, almost got some feedback is a little bit too much like the neuro iterator. Uh, but we are taking this as a huge compliment. We will definitely try to create more of our own style in the future. Though, of course, we recently started and we are fully aware of that. We have mountains of learning to do and we are constantly looking for ways to improve. Uh, with regards to this video. I'm sorry. It was a little bit late. It was a good lesson for me. Death needing three films, a full television show and a lot of other footage for my video is too much to handle for right now. Next time I will focus on one film, uh, almost next video will be on team America and his will come out in the following days. Uh, see you next time. Yeah.
