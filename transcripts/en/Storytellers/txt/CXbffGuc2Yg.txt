Speaker 1:          00:00          Yeah,

Speaker 2:          00:04          inglorious bastards. Due to my interest in water to in general, it's sporadic use of different languages, rear end damage and bolts. Historic revisionism is my favorite Tarantino film so far. It was to my surprise, therefore that film only got a 69 mets score on MDB. It turns out that 17 or diverting from history angered some critics. Jonathan Rosenbaum, for example, call to film deeply offensive and morally akin to Holocaust denial to dos critics. The history of the Holocaust is simply too serious for Cij revisionism, too serious for Terantin or style or cinematic violence, which is violence of course, as exciting over the top, spectacle or even comedy.

Speaker 1:          00:52          Oh man, a shot in the face. Do you do that? I didn't mean to do. It was an accident

Speaker 2:          00:57          check. Nutrients from now you see it argued that with inglorious pastors, Tarantino makes fun of his audience by drawing a parallel between the way the Nazis enjoyed the mindless violence and killing innovation sprite. As we enjoyed the final instantly tino creates in his own film, I was arguing for dead. It is not quite as simple as that. As some of the comments on now you see it's video Poland doubts Terentino's criticizing his audience for liking violence would be the highest form of hypocrisy. Terentino's pointed out multiple times his law for cinematic violence as fun and entertaining spectacle I was argued at with inglorious bastards. Tarantino not so much criticizes his audience for Liking Violence, bit tune historical Lens Explorers and reflects upon the cinematic violence and cinema as a whole. Many critics have pointed towards the final scene of inglorious pastors as Tarantino declaring the film is a masterpiece.

Speaker 1:          01:57          My next

Speaker 2:          02:01          yes. If you look back in the film, he places himself in question and more company when now you see it's comparison to violence in a nation sprites to defiance of the bastards. He fills to see important differences in their cinematic styles. The Nazi film stills the nutshell or a nation sprites, which is featured in the climax of inglorious bastards is a parallel to triomphe desk villains from Leni Riefenstahl, who is mentioned multiple times in the movie,

Speaker 1:          02:36          think it kind of getting you up the

Speaker 2:          02:41          violence in the nation. Sprite is shults into fascist the headache. Susan Sonntag also referring to Riefenstahl states that the fascist aesthetic, our tales of longing for high places of the men and Barf to Uber Manch while in the area and ideal that is placed above all else. The boss is to the contrary, represented multicultural collective of the American melting pots. They come from different places and backgrounds and in their difference are challenged to the area in aesthetic that Google's promotes in a nation. Surprise. Now, the opening scene often pastorates is already a break with typical Tarantino West cinematic violence. Yes, it is explosive birth. It doesn't function so much as spectacle or comedy as Terentino's violence usually does. Terentino's constructs the scene in such a way slowly building to Hans Landa, that explosion of violence feels quite horrific and quite cruel. Making this opening chapter feel more like a scene from a holocaust film than Terentino's normal. Don't worry, it's only a movie kind of violence.

Speaker 2:          03:48          Of course, this isn't the case in the next chapter where we meet the bastards here, violence is both spectacle and comedy. Although rain even directly mentioned the link between cinema and violence as sources of entertainment, to hear you say that, quite frankly, close, we're getting going to the movies. These first two chapters function in two ways. Both teens are completely different in their tone and fuel and violence. She had two scenes are also very much alike. Both feature a commander that claims to have come down from the mountains to take part in the war who is in control of the narrative and directs the scene to watch its final conclusion. Yet the violence in the first chapter feels cruel and horrific while in the second chapter at a spectacle and the comedy, of course, we're in a culture we naturally and rightfully so route for the allies and it's not for the Nazis yet. Tino does hint that the officer who is beaten to death is an honorable man.

Speaker 1:          04:54          Juice.

Speaker 2:          04:59          Tarantino deffer shows that through cinematic techniques such as the soundtrack, firelands can have two totally different functions into fairly similar scene.

Speaker 2:          05:12          The second function is to make clear the distinction between the Boston arts and Shoshana as characters. Although most of the bosses are Jewish, they come from different places and backgrounds. They are a multicultural ragtag group that merged into a greater American whole with the goal to bring terror to the Nazis were going to be doing one thing and one thing only. Killing Nancy's Shoshana, however, is defined by her identity as a Jewish victims of the Holocaust. For awhile she adopts the identity of a French girl, but she never forgets what happened to her and her family. Now the film builds towards a claim where boats have Shana and the Boston execute a revenge plots on Hitler and Nazi Mount. Both French plots together resulted in what seems to be a typical Terentino's sheen over the top violence. Yes, they are affect different narrative conclusions that's compete with each other. The Boston burst in shoot Hitler and goebbels to bits and then blow up the whole theater, including themselves. Domain boster. It's all the rain, however, survives and Indians to Boston. It's narrative is one of the rugged American cowboy that's rights into town, kills the ins against impossible odds and writes outs round recently,

Speaker 1:          06:35          scalper Herman

Speaker 2:          06:38          through this Lens. It is indeed very arguable that inglorious bastards to field licensed the horror of the Holocaust and evils of the Nazi regime against the Jewish people. However, although the film ends with the Boston Shoshana's for your French still lingers, which plays are darker and more unsettling than that of the bastards

Speaker 2:          07:08          who you French for Christ or own extinction who refer plays out from beyond the grave, while her image becomes embedded in smoke, connecting it to otherwise referenced horrors off to concentration camps. She rises from a moment of greatest vulnerability as Sheila is dying to reach an ambivalent triumph, she has other to refer on the people who murdered her family and countless others, so for people gazing at them from the smoke and ashes of the very furnished, constructed to destroyer s with the boss stood staring. Tino fulfills this revenge fantasy on the Nazis. True Shushana's narrative. Yet her narrative is much more aware of the Holocaust and Jewish suffering under the Nazis. The film. This offers two distinct narratives and the question becomes, who has effect guilty clearer? Who does the audience see as the main drive for revenge? Technically, the pastor's son, although gets the last word, yet for dose watching, it's Kenneth escaped a haunting sense that it was someone else, someone in the smoke that by now it's dispersed to the winds who really killed Hitler.
