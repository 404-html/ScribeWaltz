Speaker 1:          00:04          It was shortly after meeting drones, tracter Fitch that I realized that joining the Marine Corps might've been a bad decision. All right, come from brains. Show me exactly where your stubies I'm running. No, I never boot camp instructors doing amount of tech. What? I'm giving you a few love taps. How the fuck are you going to fire your right bow when grenades are going up in your face? What the fuck are you even doing here? Sorry, I got lost on the [inaudible]. Okay.

Speaker 2:          00:47          Now some of you might've noticed that I've placed the original opening sound check of giants, bobby mcferrin. Don't worry, be happy with the opening sound. Check off the 90 86 film full metal jackets. Now, although I have copyright reasons for this, I also think it's essential to analyze jarhead within the context of full metal jacket because of its similarities, birth even more because of its differences.

Speaker 2:          01:11          Now, jars refuse upon release were quite mixed and many were even negative. Leslie Valparin described jarred as critical as claimed that it has little new to say, and Joshua Moon stated that the film goes nowhere, but two major paradoxical criticism stood out. Joe teachy claimed that barely a frame wheel feel to remind it's audience off another seminar war movie. It's effectively the Iraq of date. Oh, full metal jacket. Yes. All this claim, the film fell out of genre as a warm movie since there were no battles being fought. Yes, I was argued that in this paradox of both relying on other warfiles while also not adhering to the Warfield Sharma lays, jr has cental team. Now, both films start out with a brutal bootcamp off the United States Marine Corps. The recruits are broken down into films, both through verbal sauce

Speaker 1:          01:58          or you have a girlfriend. Swapper sorry, I started this again, mother fucker. Jody's banging her right now. Get on your face and give me 25 per every time she gets fucked. This month down on your face

Speaker 2:          02:10          and through physical training.

Speaker 3:          02:16          Oh, that's right. Private mile. Don't make any fucking up to get up to the top of the fucking cops to go. God want to do up there. He went up very cold. Your ass up there by now. One night. Get your bags up there. Pile. The hell is the matter with your buddy. What? I bet you if there was some punchy up there on top of that off, you can get up there, Joe. Yeah.

Speaker 2:          02:38          John resembles this process closely to watch what is shown in full metal jacket from the verbal assault and equal woodless nurse without racism. Speech.

Speaker 4:          02:47          No ratio. Bigger three here. I do not look down on niggers cuts. What? They're grazer. Hey, are you all all equally worthless? You are no longer black or brown or yellow or red. You are now, you are like food or dark boon. Do you understand

Speaker 3:          03:10          any car?

Speaker 2:          03:11          Two to the glorification of marine marksman ship and reshaping of marines into coal hearts killers.

Speaker 5:          03:17          The Marine Corps does not want robots. The Marine Corps wants killers. The Marine Corps wants to build indestructable men.

Speaker 3:          03:27          We're going to kick a rock. Yes. Oh hell son. What are you going to win the medal of honor all by yourself? What's the rest of my battalion going to do? Jake? Yes, you know, I think it's time for me to retire. I can't hear how fucking day I just got off. Hard off.

Speaker 2:          03:55          Yes, it is in the second part by jar has quickly starts to differ from expectations. Jarheads shows us the marines in the deserts aware that there a war going on that's enabled to participate.

Speaker 6:          04:08          Yeah.

Speaker 3:          04:09          Suggested techniques for the marine to use and the avoidance of boredom and loneliness. Masturbation, rereading of letters from unfaithful wives and girlfriends, cleaning your rifle, further masturbation.

Speaker 2:          04:28          It is here where the central team of chartered slowly becomes apparent. Our full metal jacket is critical of the Marine corpse and the war. The marines went a full combat in Vietnam are functioning even when chaos, psoriasis in the heat of battle, they prevail and return back to order. However, in jarhead the second part of the movie is a long and grueling process of waiting boredom and living in the desert without any contact with outside world back home. Life goes on and their relationships fall apart.

Speaker 3:          05:02          She up there yet. Don't worry, she will. She'll be right there. She's going to look beautiful up there.

Speaker 2:          05:10          The Marines aimlessly patrolled the deserts in harbor oilfields get bombed by mortars but never see the enemy. It is here that the film breaks with hands. Robert Jars calls to your rising of expectations, but the viewer's expectations of a war film and the Marines expectations off the work at Cheddar before the marines leave. The film shows them getting riled up with the perspective of to grow his ride of the valkyries scene in apocalypse now, shaping their few or fought a war will be like

Speaker 7:          06:01          all personnel are to report immediately to your company or

Speaker 3:          06:09          yes,

Speaker 2:          06:13          you to spend this juxtaposition to film state. Something about a different sort of wars and the experiences of the marines in these wars. That's one of them. Reads, realizes how different this blog will be. He Commons.

Speaker 3:          06:24          Look around. You hear those fights. This board's going to move too fast for us. All right, we can shoot a thousand yards to go that far and Vietnam and take a week or one a year here. Can I take about 10 fucking seconds? By the time we have our rifles style, the war is going to be a mile down the road wake up.

Speaker 2:          06:44          But besides the new technological reality of the war, the more important statement to feel makes is on the psychological impact of being in the war or in this case not being in the war in a sense, being broken down and then rebuild as supposed Koolhaas killing marines in the Marine Corp bootcamp booth enabled to apply this mindset and acquired skills leads to just as much of a mental breakdown as the horror. So full combat. The film shows us the slow descent of the marines into these mental breakdowns with, of course, Jake, Jen, last character Swafford at the center, multiple moments than out one of the marines breaks down when he finds out his wife is cheating on him.

Speaker 3:          07:31          Sorry.

Speaker 2:          07:32          When a fellow marine gets him into trouble, swafford breaks down completely

Speaker 1:          07:36          the fuck up. Shut the fuck up. Shut the fuck out. My repeat after me. This is my rifle. There are many like it without me. My rifle went down, my rifle, I shut the fuck up. Shut the fuck.

Speaker 3:          07:57          Fuck you. Show me.

Speaker 1:          08:08          No.

Speaker 3:          08:11          Wow.

Speaker 2:          08:15          And finally, what Swafford gets a chance to shoot at an enemy. The opportunity is taken away at the last moment.

Speaker 3:          08:22          This is all for fun anyway. Well, wait, not alive. What difference does it make you come back to him? Because we got the Goddamn shut. Your fucking desk jockey and the fucking bracket or nope.

Speaker 2:          09:12          The film shows us how to offer experiences of this bar are completely different than from other wars you have. Not less awful. It is this message that reconciles the paradox of being a different war film and also leaning on its predecessors is paradox, becomes the central team and is summed up in the film in one sentence. Every worse, different. Every war is the same kettle drum swallow to boots. Dale shoes.
