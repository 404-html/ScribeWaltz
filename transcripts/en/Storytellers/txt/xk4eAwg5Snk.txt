Speaker 1:          00:13          What is the dream? The meaningless fantasy. You have the apps and mine is it the moments in which everything about life seems to be in blissful harmony. When a struggles of everyday life don't seem to exist? What happens when that dream turns out to suddenly be nothing more than the line in the lose Ori Reality? What happens when our life is suddenly turned upside down into chaos when we're two days to even realize we're nearing rock bottom or when it's been two lifeless to half men much at all. When he media comes crashing down and through our reality and to the Light House that stands at the center of our unconscious and which we had trust it to light us a bath in to the unknown and what happens when we're the ones who are directly responsible for this collapse, carrying the burden of guilt. Ever presence. You remind us of our deeds. Perhaps you lick of paint will wash it away. Covering the stains of who we truly are. Maybe that way we get to move on. He's back and miracle that something's off. He's changed and he's dying because of me. It's my fault. I'm a space or whatever he has faced before me and him. But where and how do we start?

Speaker 1:          01:31          Blackwater National Park reported that a light house was surrounded by something they termed a shimmer. Is it a religious event, an extra terrestrial event, perhaps a higher dimension, something so large and skill and alien and appearance has to be something external outside of us. And yet at the same time it feels strangely familiar, like something profoundly internal, hidden behind in ever-growing fill of illusion, staying on its edge and observing it from a distance might feel safe, but the only real solution is to be found when we mustered the courage to venture inside and so we shell and the unconscious one is unfortunately in the same situation as an a moonlit landscape. All the contents are blurred and merge into one another and one never knows exactly what or where anything is or where one thing begins and ends.

Speaker 1:          02:24          This world within the Dome is the strangest, most confusing place. One could visit and don't know where it was. Time, space and matter merge seamlessly as if in the dream, the order and structure of the outside world don't exist here. To say one might get lost in this place would be an understatement, and yet this is the place we collectively find ourselves did. Geomorphologists beyond warning the physicist without purpose, the addict, the terminally ill, the adulterer all in the state of inner confusion risking their lives to find answers, problems, only dose that are going through deep inner instability would find himself Scott up in.

Speaker 2:          03:04          It's not exactly something you do if your life is in perfect harmony,

Speaker 1:          03:08          but if the king of this world is chaos, then beauty is not the only thing one is bound to find lurking just below the surface are those primal creatures that will test our instinctual abilities when we least expect it.

Speaker 2:          03:22          Okay.

Speaker 1:          03:23          The familiar dream in which to dreamers pursued by an animal nearly always indicates that an instinct has been split off from our consciousness and ought to be yours trying to be readmitted and integrated into life. The more dangerous to behavior of the animal and the dream. The more unconscious is the primitive and instinctual soul. The dreamer and the more imperative is its integration into his life. If some irreparable evil is to be forestalled facing this dragon head on is to merge with the primal instincts that can guide us deeper into this new world. Failing to do so can make us stray from the light and become blinded in the darkness, unconscious in Darfur, a vulnerable to the dangerous that can emerge into our lives. At any moment. We've come upon an abandoned military base, a safe haven for those that came before the memory card is found. His second revelation reveals itself. The monsters we believe to be exclusively external nature dwell abundantly within our own bodies, within our souls. It realization emerges, am I to veal danger? Am I nothing bent on self destruction,

Speaker 2:          04:31          right? Drink well, we smell and taste stabilize the good job having marriage

Speaker 1:          04:39          setting, it will be to admit to one's own shortcomings, which we so often tried to hide behind a mass personality, denying it would be to disown its existence within oneself completely. There was something alive inside that man. No, that was a trick of the light. When an individual makes an attempt to see your shadow, he becomes aware of and often ashamed of those qualities and impulses he denies in himself, but completely see you and other people such things as egotism, mental laziness and sloppiness, unreal fantasy's schemes and plots, carelessness and cowardice insured all the little sins about which he might previously have told himself. That doesn't matter. Nobody will notice it, and in any case, although people do it too for to deny or the only way out is to project one's own monsters on two dose around her. How could I ever be a monster?

Speaker 1:          05:24          Maybe you or you, but not me. For it is I who knows the way and who will save the world from then nation? It's unconscious failure or to come to terms with one's own reality then becomes nothing more than another ultimate dead end. It is only doe sit on some level. I've made peace with the fact that spending time in this world is slowly changing who we are and how we perceive ourselves. It's this growing realization that the tumor of the Shimmer isn't necessarily caused by something outside of ourselves, but perhaps an echo from our own in our world. And so the only way to save the world would to save oneself. But why would one bot or to go through such lengths to salvage something that wasn't even perceive to contain much value to begin with? Life does what it wants, why bought are struggling against its will and trust wants to face it. You want to fight it?

Speaker 1:          06:15          I don't think I want to either of those things. Only those who truly desire to return will have the power to we merge. And so one by one the companions bearish dissolve and disappear. And so Lena is the only one left. Why did they have to succumb to the darkness and why am I still here where they really Anya Shepherd, Josie venturous or do you just characters every dream fragmented parts of an unconscious personality seeking to be integrated onto the body like the ever continuing cycle of death and rebirth. The sign of the oral burrows to dramatic symbol of the snake eating its own till 40 integration and assimilation of the opposite of the shadow. The only way to truly find out what all of this means is to make one final push towards the center, towards the light house. In this final leg of the journey, we are already well broken down, but as we enter into the lighthouse, we slowly began to realize the toughest challenge is still in front of us, hidden in the darkness, deep beneath the shining light at a tower in Mandela shaped or puberes magnificent in its wholeness, but equally frightening and appearance. It shows us a mirror out of which a figure emerges in shock. We stumble and we run, or perhaps we don't run at all, but lose ourselves in complete confusion. People call him the cane.

Speaker 2:          07:36          Yeah.

Speaker 1:          07:37          Now I'm not so sure I can try to fight it, but it mirrors my every move, so perhaps I should desire it for self destruction is ultimately all that certain. What is this creature at acts as if my shadow, suddenly a face begins to take form you sudden realization dawns on us.

Speaker 2:          07:57          You May.

Speaker 1:          07:58          If you are mean, if you are more meat and I am than I am alive and I can exist no longer. Okay. At Baron we finally become fully aware that this world is not at all alien in nature, but a part of her own self that was hidden away in our unconscious, desperately trying to be acknowledged. The only way forward for

Speaker 3:          08:16          Dennis to look oneself directly in the eye and accepting to shadow as it is only then can final illuminating integration be achieved and miss the hero is the one who conquers the dragon, not the one who was devoured by it. Only one who has risks. The fight with the dragon and it's not overcome by winds. The horde the treasurer hard to attain. He alone has a genuine claim to self confidence for he has faced a dark rounds of the self and dare buying has gained himself. We now know better. We truly are. And if Daryl by dissolved or pathologies do return to orders there for shown as a reconciliation of true previously a strange soles, both fought and died in one way or another and both have reemerged as someone else won a mere shadow of his former self. The other more intact strangers but strangers more attuned to each other than ever before. Embracing one another. So the very first step to start a new.

Speaker 2:          09:14          Okay.
