Speaker 1:          00:10          Yeah.

Speaker 2:          00:20          As someone who was born two years after the official collapse of the Soviet Union, it is hard to imagine the constant possibility of global nuclear war and the which the world lift for so long.

Speaker 3:          00:32          Do I have to know what happens when an atomic bomb explode? You all know when it come, we hope it never comes, but they to get ready.

Speaker 2:          00:40          There seems to be a substantial mount off existential worry right now in 2017 births. I wonder if it can compare to the way in which the world must have been honing in spreads in 90 62 when doing the Cuba crisis. Nuclear War seems births a moments away.

Speaker 3:          00:58          It arrogantly recommend that the United States and the Soviet Union pump, we'll remove the existing threat to the security of the western hemisphere and the peace of the world.

Speaker 2:          01:12          Isn't it therefore strange that when Stanley Kubrick's 90 64 movie doctor strange love opens with a nuclear bomb of being refused, it is this romantic song we are hearing. It becomes clear that Kubrick has chosen to turn the biggest threat to the world into satire. Existential dread is a great source for satirical comedy and doing the 60s to nuclear tensions were also satirized but others, Tom Lehrer, both Harvard educated mathematician and satirical songwriter roads. This, for example,

Speaker 4:          01:46          more of the bomb that drops on. You get your friends and neighbor, they'll be nobody left behind to debris and we all go together when we come back to that is to know you never sold bereavement and inspiring achievement. Yes, we all will go together when we go.

Speaker 2:          02:16          However, I think no one's satirize the cult word better than Stelly Kubrick with doctor strange love. It sends audiences books into laughter and also serious worry about why anyone could even love about worlds possibly ending in a nuclear holocaust. In this video, I want to explore both the symbolism and set of the film birth connected also to the politics of den and the politics of today by choosing this romantic song, Kubrick tunes refueling the bombers in a sexual act. Dr Strange Laugh is a movie dead ridicules the Cold War and nuclear arms race by turning it into an allegory for sex. Johnathan swift describes one of Kuric central teams in multiple of his movies instead of the damned animal man. Kubrick's characters are inherently sexual and aggressive, is weapons extensions of a sexual organs. He escapable off creating sophisticated and complicated systems, birth incapable of using them responsibly and Morley.

Speaker 1:          03:24          Yeah.

Speaker 2:          03:37          Dr. Strange Loft presents in the film, two kinds of men, first of which is the military type. These men cannot wait to drop a nuclear bomb or Russia, the main characters that embody this. Our Channel Jack the ripper who sets the whole plan to bomb Russia into motion and general buck to Richardson, Two d military men. The Cold War is incredibly frustrating. The movie ella crisis, this frustration from a lack of military action into sexual frustration. Jack the ripper refuels the reason for ordering the nuclear bomb,

Speaker 5:          04:12          I can no longer sit back and allow communist infiltration. Communist indoctrination.

Speaker 1:          04:20          Yeah.

Speaker 5:          04:20          Communist subversion.

Speaker 1:          04:23          Yeah,

Speaker 5:          04:24          and the international communist conspiracy.

Speaker 1:          04:27          Okay.

Speaker 5:          04:28          The sapien and purify all of our impressionists bodily fluids.

Speaker 1:          04:34          Okay.

Speaker 2:          04:34          And then later refuels he discovered this infiltration when trying to have sex.

Speaker 1:          04:40          Well. I first became aware of it and then drink during the physical act of love as a, yeah, a profound sense of feeling of emptiness motto.

Speaker 2:          04:56          The Cold War has taken away a sexual virility and the only solution he sees is dropping a load into modern Russia as it were. The same goes for general bucks. 30 Hudson. He leaves his rather bimbo which girlfriend right before having sex with her to go through the ballroom. He even says that his girl can already start the countdown, clear referral to the countdown off launching nuclear strikes.

Speaker 6:          05:20          You just start your comp down and old bucky, we'll be back here, but boy you can say stop.

Speaker 2:          05:28          You stand. Of course sexually frustrated and can't wait to bomb Russia

Speaker 6:          05:32          indicate that we would strive 90% of their nuclear capabilities. We went there for prevail and suffer only modest and acceptable civilian casualties from the remaining forest, which would be badly damaged and I'm uncoordinated

Speaker 2:          05:47          when the precedent for futures to do this. He starts chewing gum like a smoker, chewing gum to not smoke. He is chewing gum to distract him from his sexual frustration. Now movie is filled with Phallic symbols such as the aforementioned refueling of the bombers, the Cigar General Jack The ripper smokes the lung machine on the uses. And at the end of the movie aircrewman the Kong who symbolizes the biggest direction note to men when he quote unquote writes the bomb. As Joan says, swift said these are extensions of the mill sexual organs. The other kind of men in the film is the one that doesn't want to drop the bomb. He is a fiscally week sexually impotent men plays by the same Ectera Dsr English captain Lionel Mandrake, the precedent Merkin muffly and doctor strange love himself. The English Captain Mandrake who tries to stop General Jack The ripper is fiscally impaired and enabled to use the rather phallic machinegun referring to a sexual impotence. Yeah,

Speaker 3:          06:47          I uh, I haven't had any much experience, you know, with those machines. Yeah. Got It. Any of a professed a bathroom in my sales pitch. Heinrich in the name of the magazine in the continental congress come in and treatment. That's a boy. Yeah. I'd love to come back time. What's happened. You'll see the string and my legs gone. One, Craig, I've never told you what you see. Gammy leg. Yeah.

Speaker 2:          07:17          The precedent who dismisses all of the military passion is rather wimpy and weak looking when he calls the Russian precedent. It sounds like an all sexist marriage where the emasculated precedent tries, but Phil's to control his annoying complaining wife.

Speaker 5:          07:33          Well, listen. How do you think I feel about it? Can you imagine how I feel about it? Dimitri, why do you think I'm calling you just to say hello? Of course I like to speak to you. Of course. I like to say hello. Not now, but anytime. Dimitri, I'm just calling up to tell you something terrible has happened. It's a friendly call. Of course, it's a friendly call.

Speaker 2:          08:00          The last of the sexually impotent men is doctor strange love, also weak and physically impaired. He is a scientist who used to work for the Nazis. He represents the Nazi scientist that started working in the u s after World War Two searches when from Brown, who was also satirized by Tom Lehrer

Speaker 4:          08:20          gather round while I sing you a banner. Fun Brown. A man who's that lead jams Isru the by expedia bought him a Nazi. He won't even fry Nazi schmaltzy. Sas Van are fine.

Speaker 2:          08:39          Doctor Strange love symbolizes paralyzed. It's not destroyed Nazi ideology. When it becomes clear that the bomb will be dropped. He suggests a Bronco with many women chosen for their sexual attributes to repopulate the earth. A suggestion that the Mescaleros precedent likes,

Speaker 7:          08:57          you mentioned the ratio of 10 women to each man. Wouldn't that necessitate the abandonment of the so called a monogamous sexual relationship? I mean, as far as men were concerned,

Speaker 8:          09:14          yes, it is. You know, a sacrifice is required for the future of the human race. I hasten to add that since each man the it will be required to do, but to just service along these lines there women will have to be selected for this sexual characteristics, which you have to be of a highly stimulating nature.

Speaker 2:          09:37          Well, book is showing about preventing a nuclear missile gap after they leave the bunkers. After the nuclear Holocaust, Dr. Strange loss, paralyzed body is healed by this idea of pure breeding inside the bunker while he shouts out,

Speaker 9:          09:54          right.

Speaker 2:          09:57          Ending the movie with the nuclear Holocaust. While we hear a song about two lovers death, we will meet again.

Speaker 10:         10:07          No, no, no, no. We need again, sunny today.

Speaker 2:          10:23          When the film came out in 90 64 it's fit in and satirize perfectly. The political situation of it's time. On the one hand, it's ridicules Republicans search as young Reagan and the presidential candidates. Very cool toddler who is aggressive anticommunist pro nuclear expansion. We're Toyak was criticized strongly by Democrats who saw him this dangerous warmongering.

Speaker 9:          10:46          See it sounds like it's a side job. I'm big claim like a 52 jet exhaust, fry them tickets to the bar. He got a chance

Speaker 2:          10:59          in the week. You miss escalators. Characters in doctor strange love. We see the so called wimpy EC has Democrats search as Adelaide Stevenson. He was called [inaudible] Bay. Richard Nixon in 1952 the term refers to intellectuals that are too out of touch with reality, the common people, sexual interests, et cetera. In today's politics. I think it's no surprise why so many. We're worried about trump having access to the nuclear codes with his sexual remarks and x from the guts, aggressive, reactionary. We're toric. We seen him clearly, Kubrick stamps, animal men, the passionate, sexually aggressive military characters in doctor strange love. That is why many solid him, a serious threat to nuclear stability. Even though trump supporters pointed out that when looking at actual policy, Clinton Syrian policy would be much worse for us relations and nuclear stability or so people thought. It's very clear that Dr strange loves still holds up today in the movie, the sexual tension was released sending the world into nuclear holocaust. Luckily in reality, this never happens, but the cold war and doesn't seem to have ended after the fall of the Soviet Union. He bird has been simmering on below the surface. We hope it's willing to come to an eruption birth. It's still good time to rewatch Dr. Strange laugh to become aware again and also have a good laugh about the possibility of nuclear annihilation. I wish we had one of them. Don't stay machine because s Tom Lehrer sings, at least we will all go together when we go

Speaker 4:          12:40          and we were all go together when we go boarding. Back to that is to know you never sold bereavement and inspiring achievement. Yes. We all will go together when we go all go together. When we go all suffused with an incandescent glow, no one will have the endurance to collect on his insurance. Lloyd's of London will be loaded when they go all fried together. When we Friday, we'll be French fried potatoes by and there will be no more misery when the world is. I wrote disagree. Yes. We all will fry together when we fry.
