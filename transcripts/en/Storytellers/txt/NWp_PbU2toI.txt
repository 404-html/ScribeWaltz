Speaker 2:          00:23          right?

Speaker 1:          00:26          Politics is no longer just theater. It's show business. So let's put on the best show in town. One of the most defining aspects of house of cards is it's breaking of the fourth wall inspired by Shakespeare's King Richard, the third. Now he's the wind out of our discontent made glorious summer. This method of directly addressing the audience is very effective in pulling the audience closer towards the inner thoughts and motivations of the main character. For those of us climbing

Speaker 3:          00:54          top of the food chain, there can be no mercy. There is but one hunt or be hunted

Speaker 1:          01:04          and house of cards. This method is used to call Faye the dual polarity between frank underwood's inner thoughts and his personality and his outwards behavior. The image he constructs of himself.

Speaker 3:          01:15          We have to hold this sticky fingers and wipe the filthy mouth. Teach them right from wrong. Tell them what to sync and how to see you and what do we want.

Speaker 1:          01:25          This is central to what makes the show so successful as a hyper reps inflation or free or America politics as our colleagues at waste cracker, if bonded hours to officials in house of cards often focus on theater, aesthetics and art because this points to the fundamental concepts that appearance drives politics. Politics is performance. It is no coincidence that David fincher is the executive producer and director of the first two episodes of the show. His camera movements are always smooth, precise, and in his own words, moving perfectly. A screen prison points out the color Palette of the show is dark, representing the underworld that the underwoods move in and to cold blue and warm yellow color contrasts represents the pool between human warmness and Colton ambition. The composition is precise and set designers thorough the way fincher carefully constructed images to look perfectly stands parallel to the way frank and Claire Underwood Catholic constructor own images, images, of course, that height a darker reality. That's right.

Speaker 3:          02:31          We don't submit the terror. We make the terror.

Speaker 1:          02:41          Politics as theater is a criticism of many contemporary scholars on bill life, American politics just as to underwoods image s carefully crafted and managed from Cuba. Tucsdon speeches, live free or die, live free or die

Speaker 4:          02:59          two well, it's

Speaker 1:          03:00          kind of hairstyle or dress, claire, where's the same is true for real life. American politicians, so called establishment politicians on both sides of the aisle tend to adopt few points that resonate with the biggest part of that base.

Speaker 5:          03:14          You were against same sex marriage. Now your Ford, you defended President Obama's immigration policies. Now you're saying they're too harsh. He supported his trade deal dozens of times. You can call it the gold standard now suddenly last week you're against it. When you say anything to get elected,

Speaker 1:          03:27          they carefully avoid any controversy and use catch phrases and slogans instead of discussing nuance issues, honestly and intellectually,

Speaker 2:          03:35          but I've tried to figure out how we get them to have pokemon go to the polls

Speaker 6:          03:43          and we are going to make our country great again.

Speaker 1:          03:48          The appeal of house of cards lies in its confirmation or for what we already suspect that it's behind the Catholic cross. The facade or decent politics. There is dishonesty, scheming, blackmill, rootless power, hunger, and maybe even criminality, and this is the reason the audience roots, especially in the early seasons for it's immoral, may character, frank underwood's, he participates in a theater of politics. Birth only lets the viewers into the real truth. The fewer appreciates frank on the woods. Authenticity in those moments of audience address, even though it's authentic, self is deeply immoral. The road to power is paved with them

Speaker 2:          04:27          and casualties, never, right? Correct.

Speaker 1:          04:35          Because we disliked the hypocrisy off this political theater so much. We love how frank uses it against itself. It does becomes clear that people are hef and moral honesty. Then moral dishonesty, we simply detests hypocrisy or fake morality more than authentic wickedness. It is here to us. We can make a comparison to real life. American politics, frank and Claire on the woods career politician power couple dynamic has often been compared to that of the Clintons. Just as to underwoods. The Clintons represent carefully constructed images and teared up politics where the standpoints, they take change according to what is most popular with the base and as the audience of house of cards like seeing the Ari suspected power, hunger and corruption behind the facade of theater and the show, it became increasingly clear the citizens of the United States didn't trust the establishment. Politicians like the Clintons anymore during the 2016 election and chose something else.

Speaker 2:          05:34          Sorry to keep you waiting. Complicated business

Speaker 1:          05:38          raccoon praise that trump receives from his fence is that at least he tells it like it is. It says it like it is, speaks to the truth. It doesn't mean if what he says is mean immoral or even to whether it's the truth or not. I think he tells you the way he feels. What matters is that he sees what he thinks filtering or changing his words to protect this image.

Speaker 7:          06:00          I see the political rhetoric. Most of the politicians talk and let's say pastel colors. They talk for two hours and you go away saying, what did they say? If substance? Probably nothing, but they haven't offended anybody and tried to make everybody to that friend. Well, if they're passed out, uh, Donald Trump is vivid colors because he says things away. They are

Speaker 1:          06:25          some fall so far outside of the political theater that's Clinton represents and to United States. Citizens starts at tie off that he became electable.

Speaker 8:          06:34          It's just awfully good that someone with the temperament of Donald Trump is not in charge of the law in our country because you'd be in jail.

Speaker 1:          06:43          Since people will choose and moral authenticity of both moral, a dishonesty, are we always choosing between liars and crooks, corrupt politicians and mean idiots? Is there a place in Washington for authentic, idealistic, honest politicians?

Speaker 8:          06:59          Welcome to the death of the age of reason? There is no right or wrong. Not Anymore. There's only being in and then being out.

Speaker 1:          07:15          Can we move beyond tita politics and into real intellectual debate where we argue for our fuse, both accept each other's differences? Can we move to genuine politics within the chaos off the 2016 election? Hope for this appeared in a curious form. Various intellectuals or differing opinion are holding civilize debates where the RQ genuine authentic beliefs without constructing or protecting the images while also still respecting the other. Yes, although they are gaining in popularity, the question remains if such politics is possible on a nationwide level. Since authenticity also breeds polarization, can authentic politics captured the majority of the masters or are the worst sites or frank on the woods the best we can do.
