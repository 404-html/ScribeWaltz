Speaker 1:          00:05          This is many of you will undoubtedly remember. It's the opening shot of Disney's beauty and the beast. At first glance, it's colorful ballot and introduction of main characters and plot points don't seem to deviate too much from your typical Disney movie. We have her princess or young adult girl who seeks some sort of fulfillment or help element of magic evil forces working against the princess or prince coming to the rescue and of course the ensuing love story. However, despite first surface level impressions, this is not at all what beauty in the beast is about as it goes down a wholly different and darker path all together, thereby namely following the principles of the Gothic John. Now it's important that we outlined the difference between the male and the female gothic. The mill variant laid the foundations for today's horror stories. Wiles, the female version became the basis for today's historical romance stories, if you will. Version route generally feature a dark ass or a mansion style with looming arches in towers, a young woman thesis of a dark secret to uncover who runs away at some point before she discovers her own power. A flawed romantic lead who must be taught how to love a rival or alternative lead who turns out to be evil. And finally a happy ending through a process of redemption.

Speaker 1:          01:29          Interestingly to sub genre has long been characterized by kind of schizophrenia representing the female leads, inner struggle with personality or conscious and unconscious fight between conforming jurors society and breaking away from it. So it's not hard to see that this is exactly a thing that bell attempting to deal with in her own small town world. It's a theme that moves her forward and drives her decision making and really encompasses the story of beauty and the beast in its entirety. In fact, I would argue that the film in itself is not so much about finding law in each other as it is about finding love and peace in one itself.

Speaker 1:          02:14          Well of course in order for peace to exist, there also has to be war. As the plot is breaking into its fruit, I climax, we are exposed to the peak of beauty and the beast drama, the final showdown between guest on his angry mob and the misunderstood beast. But as exciting and funny as it may be, to watch the innovating villagers get ambushed by it, to be stool servants. Looking at it from an outside perspective also makes it undeniably silly. I don't get me wrong, you're probably thinking, well, Thomas, why wouldn't it be? It's a fairy tale, and that's exactly right. It's fantasy. It's a made up story, but it's utilized. You convey a very real message. One that as is not uncommon for Gothic novels, exists on the interior rather than the exterior because the actual focus of the story is not really the physical struggle of Belle and the beast to be accepted into our world, but rather the emotional and unconscious struggle between the animal and human natures within the protagonists scene first and the Greek myth of arrows and CCA, this archetypal story deals with the reality of the bodied Ron Nature and sexual side of humans on the one hand and the more spiritual, rational soul on the other centuries later fairytales, the big, the same duality and animal groom tills in which the animal makes the life of the female protagonists unpleasant but ultimately turn out to be gentlemen or princess in disguise.

Speaker 1:          03:39          This recurring characterised also been described as the image of the wild man who's part of an archetypal dialectic that places wildness along with such things as Savitri madness, heresy and hatred and conceptual antithesis to all things civilization. Now as we look back at the story of beauty and the beast is dwell, the becomes highly apparent. Being to wild men character and his story. Beast identifies of a number of animal motifs. The first and most obvious one being his ugliness and physical appearance, but more importantly, it's the realization that is hideous. Appearance is linked directly to his ugly personality. Why isn't she here? Yet? We know from the voiceover in the beginning of the movie that he was spoiled, selfish and unkind liking law. Then his heart, his inner world is mirror directly to his surroundings as a showcase by the constant dark and venue. Rhetor has ravaged hidden west wing and the existence of this tool servants because he who treats his fellow human beings as tools will ultimately only see them as such and nothing more as a side effect of his appearance. Bese also identifies with the Motif of captivity. Not only does he wrongfully imprisoned marise, he initially also doesn't feel remorse for doing the same to bell. The for a prisoner in his castle then is himself having drifted into apathy and rage over his. Apparently he cursed fate with this lowly mental state comes his last Motif nonthinking which just metaphorically shown here in is repressed. The ability to

Speaker 2:          05:05          read that I can't. It's just Ben Guest Oss

Speaker 1:          05:15          is second carrier of the Animal Motif. Of course, he starts off as what seems to be the epitome of perfected humanity with his handsome looks, strong physical appearance and attachment to the freedom motif. No one says no to guests in reality. However, this is only but a facade as he's covered with hair foreshadows the beast thickness within his physical beauty. Gustavo sends a freedom is also strongly egoic and vindictive as it depends on its ability to control both animal as well as human whatever the cost may be fun. My wife make no mistake about that. It's no surprise that his character mirroring beasts also identifies of non thinking and even sees it as something malevolent. Ooh, I'm afraid. I've been thinking dangerous pastime. I know bell on the other hand is the one major carrier of the human motif like a star. She identifies a beauty which is really the only thing the villagers compliment her for.

Speaker 2:          06:15          There she goes,

Speaker 1:          06:21          or oddity marks the second and third. Once he has it showcases her sense of individualism and strive for freedom

Speaker 1:          06:32          because although at the moment she's torn between fitting in and leaving her provincial life behind. She finds solace in reading a lot. This one, but you've read it twice. Film evidently makes no secret about it that val identify at the thinking with Eve, read it and unthinking so much so it at her entire inner beauty and humanities seems to originate from the archetypal stories she has read. These books have taught her to archetypes for fighting injustice against overwhelming odds for seeing beyond the surface for courage and strength and once oddities and for wisdom and decision making and breaking away from group think. According to Carl Young, the absolute strength of these archetypal stories lies in our function as pointers to to quote unquote collective unconscious, that part of self that mediates between our consciousness and unconsciousness, the human and the animalistic with the goal to guide us towards maturity, to bridge that internal divide.

Speaker 1:          07:26          We see it in bell. She's slowly developing and trying to figure out her own individuality, her own uniqueness, but paradoxically does natural process of individuation is also at the core of the growing loss of the ability to live in the present moment, a loss of sense of oneness in community and to you. Borek force of nature as a whole now have that knowledge in mind, a new door in to the uniqueness of beauty and the beast has suddenly opened, revealing to us the films function as an archetypal Meta narrative of sorts. We can now see how at first be strikes a deal with his dwell. He buys scapegoating and and her

Speaker 2:          08:02          awesome eat with me doesn't eat.

Speaker 1:          08:07          We can also see how this method of victimization has worked for guest on who was fully identified and content with his ego until bell comes along, breaking the fragility of this illusion and causing guest dawn's humanity to crumble completely as he slowly descends into his brutish, animalistic nature until it ultimately he destroys him glee for beasts. The reverse happens when bell shines a light on his darker side and invites him to come to terms with it through axle. Selflessness and honesty.

Speaker 2:          08:43          Yes, please.

Speaker 1:          08:44          What happens next is the beginning of both their transformations as beast rescues bell from the pack of wolves and she in turn shoot his honor and compassion by saving beasts these actions, bees to move away from as victimization and to take self responsibility for the very first time, which doesn't go unnoticed.

Speaker 2:          09:03          Now he's

Speaker 1:          09:07          why I didn't see it there before. And out of bell two is conscious of our own ignorance. The seed for their ultimate unification has been blended. What follows is a process of growth and interplay of dwell at ease, which ends with a dance in which animal and human are joined together and attack line of the song.

Speaker 2:          09:24          Let me go skate. Beauty. And the beast

Speaker 1:          09:32          is at this point that beast is ready to make the final step in his transformation by show of true love, through a dramatic act of self sacrifice. And after having spent some time alone, bell realizes the same thing as she kneels down beside the dying beast. So to spell is finally broken as both transformations have now been completed. And so Belle and the beast, the human and the animal are finally reunited and reintegrated in coexisting harmony. It's an archetypal story that has become more relevant in today's world than it's probably ever been. The upcoming and true search of social media and in particular dating apps, f arguably bloated our egos and have degraded the concept of love and to Amir and mindless movement off the finger. We suppress and ignore our anxieties and our feelings of separateness by connecting evermore. Yet a lot of us can't help but feel meaningless alone. It really is a continuous struggle until we choose to stop seeing it as such and instead face it head on and make it into a dance.
