Speaker 1:          00:00          Alright, so before we begin, I want to say to the video that you're about to watch is one of our additional commentary videos, uh, they're very low key on the editing side, so don't expect anything too fancy. And they were basically just meant to add some things or respond to comments about the original video essay in the past. We made these for our patrons only, but from now on, these additional commentary that will be posted on our second channel, which is called the storytellers podcasts. The link for that is in the description. This is because we're working on a complete patron and channel makeover, which we're really excited about. We're working together with a graphic designer to help us build a or make a better banner, more professional, better, and it's looking really good. So I, I hope it will be up in a couple of weeks probably.

Speaker 1:          00:47          Um, and yeah, we're really excited about it. Uh, so our patrons will still get a better deal of course. Uh, so from where in front of that checkout, my comment on this video, also, one last note, I've been seeing a number of people getting offended by my criticism of high profile liberal audiences mostly, uh, although I do not explicitly mentioned that I'm as much criticizing dose people as I am the neoconservatives who saw it as praising the Iraq war. I'm just trying to provide a, a new way of looking at the film. You don't have to agree with me. Um, I was just trying to show a structural message of the film in an objective manner, uh, or at least as objective as possible. Anyways, enjoy guys. Alright. Hello everyone. So three days ago, uh, I uploaded my American sniper video and in the meantime we've got a lot of comments, questions and criticisms and now I wanted to make this video to answer and talk about some of the top comments that we got and that touch on some important and the most talked about points.

Speaker 1:          01:45          Uh, but before I get into any of that, I want to promote the thesis that I use for this analysis. And now just just that I use is called terministic screens and partisan audiences, a birkin cluster analysis of Clint Eastwood's American sniper by Daniel K dot Mervin. Now he uses the same cluster analysis method of the sickening to film, but takes it a step further by combining it with liberal and conservative terministic screens or in other words, the weight at both of those groups look at the world and which terms they resonate with. Um, and he uses both of these things to examine how either of the parties interpreted the film food our own political screen or misinterpreted, if you will. You can pause it here if you want to read it a little bit. But yeah, it's, it's a fairly thought provoking fingers, a lot of truth in it.

Speaker 1:          02:32          Uh, it's available for free online. Uh, I'll try to add a link in the description in the description so you can check it out if you're interested. Uh, yeah. So yeah, I mainly use a cluster analysis method combined with some of his own findings for my own video, um, as it's a great tool to discern the main themes of a film, texts objectively, and to see how to subordinate terms change value throughout. All right, so without further ado, let's go onto some of the comments. And the first one is by Ellis. Oh, oh, interesting. Take on. The film didn't realize it got so much hate. You enter into a difficult area though when labeling American sniper as anti war, which I don't think is necessarily defined by showing the destructiveness of war, but rather by to what extent the destruction can be justified in the end as we're American sniper.

Speaker 1:          03:21          The fact that he did get his bad guy at the end and got a big funeral parade and hero status. Granted, not by everyone but still to me shows that this is far from an antiwar film. I'm pretty sure there are plenty of folks out there who look at a film like this and think it was all worth it. Okay. So I believe this touches on what now you see it has said in this video about war films, if you don't know him, he's a, another video ses who, uh, is actually fairly, fairly popular and makes a lot of great video. So, uh, I'll put a link to that video in the description as well. Basically, his statement is that a film can be defined as a pro war film if the benefits outweigh the costs of the war, which he states is a thing that American sniper shows.

Speaker 1:          04:02          So although I agree with the observation of what a pro war film is, I don't believe it fully applies to American sniper. So as I've shown in my video, the three pillars of Kyle's thinking or shown to be completely destructive to family and in some ways even as military family as it gets to have his friends skilled. So never do we see any progress in the Iraq war as well. Instead, things seem to be escalating and getting worse every time. Call Kyle comes back. Um, and then in the last battle, we see that even after he wants to protect his family, he's still putting himself and other soldiers in danger. Now, I am going to agree with the fact that there should've been more of a negative consequence for him, especially in that last scene which could have been shown in one of the other soldiers getting killed or maimed, but I'll get back to that in a little bit.

Speaker 1:          04:50          Overall, I believe that if American sniper war to be a heavily pro war film showing the benefits outweighing the costs, the values that cow carries with him, which are those highly conservative or more like neoconservative values, would definitely not have been depicted to be so detrimental to family in every shape and form. Instead, those values would have been shown to be positive and effective in in school and not entirely flawed. Also, I don't believe that the film was pro war just for portraying someone who personally was a belief that there isn't really any benefit over costs in the film. We just see to work costing more and more with less and less benefit. If we see benefit at all, in the end, he dies that the war is and resolve. The families are still being destroyed and tries to depict as dogmatic beliefs the destructiveness of said beliefs and shows them to be more of a tragic, a flawed character.

Speaker 1:          05:42          In my opinion. It is, however, still respectful to his intentions as a person, which brings us to to portrayal of Chris Kyle and also our second common by before the credits. I would agree with you. It wasn't for a few things. I see you mentioned this isn't about kyle himself, but he who he was as a real person plays a part in what the movie became. It seems he just wasn't a good person at all. He lied a lot and it seems to love more himself, which isn't shown in a movie that played a role with the people who watching the movie dead look more into them. All right, so this touches on a part of the films criticism that I believe hold some truth. Clint Eastwood is very obviously careful to not portray cow as a person in a negative light, and as Bradley Cooper has stated, the film actively tries to put emphasis on veterans and honors their plight in the process.

Speaker 1:          06:32          Now, I think the certain Lakin nuanced depth and Kyle's character makes that some of the antiwar elements might've become overshadowed and angry if that, um, I've only read a little bit about the controversy surrounding him, so I don't know how much of it is true or whether this was known to, to filmmakers are in production. But what I do know to be true is that Carl has stated in his autobiography to have enjoyed, to have enjoyed killing people in Iraq, which is, um, uh, something that, uh, before the credits touched on in his comment. Um, this is something that's only subtly hinted at the movie. I think, uh, uh, as you know, you can see tyack questioning Kyle's real intentions, uh, as he wants to go back for a fourth time because she doesn't believe that he's doing it to protect his family's anymore. But for other, more personal reasons, uh, but I think the film mainly explains isn't as obsession with killing the people responsible for murdering his friends.

Speaker 1:          07:23          Um, so I would agree that the antiwar message would have been clear if this would have been implemented, uh, his, his enjoyment of killing and would have benefited the quality and the honesty of the film in general if, if, if this aspect of college would have been shown in the movie. But I do understand that, you know, this would have probably never happened, you know, even if Clint Eastwood would have wanted to implement it, the guy had just been shot. So I think they were extra careful in this portrayal. And besides that, there's also the possibility that the studio just wanted to play it safer for a big audience and that might have opened the door for a more pro neoconservative viewing of the film. Um, I mean, this is not Francis Ford Coppola prancing around half naked in the Philippine jungles and his own budget. So I doubt East we'd had complete liberty in this unless someone can prove me wrong, of course.

Speaker 1:          08:13          But that brings us to a number of questions. Does Clint Eastwood and directors of war films in general hold a responsibility in the interpretation of their films? So even if you personally wanted to make it predominantly anti war film, I'm having part of the audience interpreted as a pro war film, does that mean that it is his failure or failure on his part or is it a failure on the audience's part to misinterpret the film? Does that mean that we have to do away with subtlety when it comes to sensitive topics, does that mean that we have to limit a director's liberty and in, in showing his own view, uh, or to be political correct. Politically correct in depicting of these sensitive topics? Or is it to be found in the apparent, this honest portrayal of Chris Kyle, even though it was only meant to be roughly based on his life, are in bio pics in essence problematic when it comes to creating a fake narrative around a real person?

Speaker 1:          09:09          Or is it all just fiction and people shouldn't learn history from fiction films. Alright. So those are some of the questions that popped up for me and that could further the conversation in the comments section because I want to know what you think about this personally and, and what your views are a, I think with that, I've set most of what I intended to say and I hope I provided you have some further context in ways to further the conversation. Um, of course I appreciate constructively, constructively post varying viewpoints of which I'm looking forward to seeing more in this common section. Uh, thank you all for watching.
