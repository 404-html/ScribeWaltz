Speaker 1:          00:04          No, a couple of days after the remembrance of d day on the sixth of June, 1944. I think it is a good moment to reflect upon how alive we'll talk to still is in our culture and in our hearts. Although every year there are new films and TV stead deal with the Second World War. The most defining of the last decades is still by far saving private Ryan. The movie has taken an important role in the public memory of words or to ask Mathias fiedler states now that the generation that fought in the war is slowly leaving us. Our post memory of the war becomes increasingly reliant on mediated images of the past. Those were two movies hold a cultural position where they actively engaged younger generations with the older generation that experienced and fought in the war. Ryan moonroof rq, Istats, watching, saving private Ryan became a cultural event where different generations sometimes saw the movie together and then discuss some of the pain and trauma that came with remembrance.

Speaker 1:          01:14          Marianna Hirsch has coined this practice where younger generations engaged with traumatic memories of all the generations to cultural artifacts as post memory. Now, to make an argument about how Saving Private Ryan Folks Post Memory, we have to look at how the movie creates a connection between the audience and the characters on screen since the characters represent the soldiers that fought in world war two. We can do this by exploring Marie Smith structure or sympathy moray device audience identification with cinematic characters into central imagining and essential imagining. Central imagining is when the audience literally fuels while to characters on screen feel fear, anger, happiness, etc. This is what's buber primarily tries to achieve in the opening sequence of saving private ryan using the handheld shaky cam that moves and tax to the violence on the beach. Spielberg simulaTes the actual experience of a soldier in the middle of it as the camera functions as the eyes of the viewer, humorous made to feel as if he is in the middle of the violence and trauma of war. Closing the gap between the audience and the characters on screen. Spew book then in fights is food into the subjective experience of the soldiers on screen by using sound effects that conveyed the shell shock of the soldiers

Speaker 1:          02:55          central imagining, however asked me criticized since it is impossible, achieve it completely in spite of all the cinematic techniques, the audience contrary to the characters on screen and soldiers they represent back in 1944, is still safely watching in a theater, turning the violence and horror of war into spectacle. Therefore, one straw to foa one stated that there is no such thing as an antiwar movie. Stills, spielberg takes a mighty shots at evoking an effective central imagining and not completely successful, I would say since there were reports or federal having ptsd attacks. Upon screening a movie, it is clear that spielberg has in a way succeeded in having us audience experienced the horrors of war. Contrary to central imagining a or imagining is where the fewer stones literally fueled the same things as the characters. Birth. Instead, sympathize with their experience. Smith subdivides this into recognition, alignment and allegiance recognition being simply recognizing characters as who they are, men, women, american soldiers, german soldiers, etc.

Speaker 1:          04:09          Alignment is when the audience gets access to the experience and thinking of the characters, and allegiance is when the audience has evaluated the characters moral choices and start rooting for them. I would argue that safe and private ryan's narrative structure is designed to have the audience build a strong allegiance with the characters on screen. After the opening sequence, the film narrows in on a small group of soldiers. Those costs were 12, saving private ryan. Throughout the film, we stay close to these men and their experiences creating a lot of time to bond with them. Saving private ryan is not unique in this many war films focus on a small set of characters in the myths of huge historical offense as stalin wants. Sets one. Death is a tragedy. A million deaths is a statistic in saving private ryan. The audience connects strongly with a small group of soldiers.

Speaker 1:          05:07          She has these characters represent the american soldiers in world war two as a whole. This is a much more effective way of evoking posts memory, dan, for example, 90, 60 to the longest day where we see dna from a lot more angles and with a lot more characters. This gives some more complete oversight of dda, yet it feels to establish a strong connection between the audience and the characters on screen and this who they represent. Finally, saving private ryan begins and ends with a scene of private ryan in current day attending the crosses of his fallen saviors. This is a clear reminder to the audience. They're the generation that followed in and survived the second world war is still among us. I was arguing with speed work and tom hanks achieved the same effect even better in band of brothers and two pacific. My opens each episode with interviews of the actual soldiers that are portrayed on screen. My generation is I think the last generation that can personally talk to veterans of world war two. As roy metcalfe states, the gis are leaving us now, leaving us a priceless legacy and this the responsibility of keeping a life. Their experiences in our cultural memory will rest more and more upon the films and series that's portrayed him.

Speaker 1:          06:34          Thank you all for watching. This video turned out a little bit different than our plans since I wanted to compare saving private ryan tuerck german show called muto until father a that uses the same techniques to give a different perspective on the german side of the war. It has to audience sympathize with normal german soldiers also being fixed in terms of the nazi regime. Uh, unfortunately german copyright law made it impossible anyway.
