Speaker 1:          00:03          For me. A movie that's brilliantly combines both cinematic storytelling and social critique is David fincher's, the social network, the movie centers around it's Mark Zuckerburg plate by Jesse Eisenberg and the creation of facebook. Now the work of director David fincher is known for dark central teams of mccarver firelands crime broken psychology. His major characters range from emotionally closed off to depressed and schizophrenia to complete psychopathic serial killer. She begged for her life. She begged for her life set up and for the life of the baby inside of her. Knowing this, I think it's easy to predict the social network is not going to be your average run of the mill young struggling entrepreneur success story. This already becomes clear in the soundtrack during the opening credits. This piece of music that's returns multiple times in the movie combines the saft piano tune in an uneasy tension creating file in behind it. The score created by Trent reznor already illustrates the major teams of the movie named Leah, broken loneliness and a seating anger, a thirst for power underneath it.

Speaker 1:          01:24          So the question is, what does the social network really about? Let's get started. The narrative of the movie doesn't rely so much on the creation of facebook to be a good story. The central teams can also be found in many important stories throughout history. It's the right off the film. Aaron Sorkin says it's not a movie about facebook. It's a movie set against the backdrop of facebook, but really it's the themes and this move yours. All the storytelling itself, the as he calls them Shakespearean teams that and is talking about are things like power, hunger, social class section, love, friendship, loyalty and betrayal only friend. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          02:12          These teams are embedded in a plot that focuses on the relationships that Mark Hass and destroys during the creation of facebook. The narrative for stores from the prospective of two hearings, one buyer market sued by his former best friend and another where Marc sued by its competitors. The opening act and all the seats that's folks on the creation of facebook are in fact flashbacks solely ever feeling the reasons mark it suits for fucking over as best friends potentially stealing the idea of facebook from this competition. Do you see any of your code on facebook? I, I use any of your coke, she stole our whole Goddamn idea. match.com for hiring and you know, you really don't need it forensics team to get to the bottom of this and if you guys were the inventors of facebook ad to Facebook, it is certainly true that the film's plot can't stand on its own as a strong end entertaining story. Yet in my opinion, to see the creation of facebook and as just the background of the story does not do the film justice. Facebook as the biggest and most powerful social let's book in the world is a fascinating subject for media scholars and a lot of questions and critique and it's working. Yes, found within the plot dialogue and especially the character's personality,

Speaker 2:          03:25          you have part of my attention, you have a minimum amount. The rest of my attention is back at the offices of facebook where my colleagues and I are doing things that no one in this room including and especially your clients or intellectually or creatively capable of doing.

Speaker 1:          03:37          I want to look at this from a couple of different perspectives, building it up and important, but first I have to say many scholars have found positive aspects of facebook. Since you know the nature of finches work, we are mainly discussing critique on facebook, which of course it's very important critique, but it does mean facebook is something evil that only as negative for infection. Social life for example, if facebook has had very positive effects on weak social ties, meaning that week social relations such as holiday friends, which are problematic because of this. This can stay active. Thanks you facebook. Now back to the fields critique or facebook. A major issue of the recent years is incident Boudin and the nature of the comment sections, discussions on social and political issues of quickly escalate right for comments on mine for victims of bullying. Often in high school, the bullying continues to facebook when they come home and the social network, when mark gets broken up with he blocks hatefully about his ex girlfriend when he tries to apologize. She perfectly explains the nature of Internet bullying in a couple of lights.

Speaker 2:          04:39          The Internet's not written in Pencil mark. It's written in ink and you published an eric all Brits and Bitch right before you made some ignorant crack about my family's name, my bra size, and then graded women based on their hotness. You write your snipe bullshit from a dark room because that's what the angry do nowadays,

Speaker 1:          04:58          June, the beginning of the film off to Moscow from, so I'll put him in the opening scene. Mark also creates a website where you can rank the university's girls in the hotness against each other. The scene intercut, secretion and immediate popularity of this website against a fraternity party where girls are brought in on a bus and are clearly sexually objectified. This illustrates beautifully how the sexual objectification of girls and college is digitalized, creating a sort of power shift from the fraternity, popular jocks to show called nerds. That's created the website at the end of the scene. Even the jokes at the party are clicking on the website. This is the key of the film's critiques. It's concentrating on the digitalization of the social experience of college, not only in the front birds but also the hard parts such as social hierarchy, exclusion and rejection

Speaker 2:          05:47          and talking about taking the entire social experience of college and putting it online. I can't feel my legs. I know I'm totally psyched about this too, but pardot. Yeah,

Speaker 1:          05:58          it would be exclusive. See in a world where social structure was everything, that was the thing. This brings us back to the original themes of sadness and anger in the opening credits soundtrack and we see facebook as a digitalization of social life. We have to look at the social life of its creator already in the opening scene of the film, much becomes clear about mark's motivations is obsessed with getting into a final club because of the social standing it would provide, but because of this he completely misses out that his girlfriend is trying to have real conversation with him and he has condescending to her social conditioning.

Speaker 2:          06:33          You want to tell you that? I think you might want to be a little more supportive. I get in, I will be taking you to the events and the gatherings and they'll be meeting a lot of people you wouldn't normally get to me.

Speaker 1:          06:46          Mark solution to his inability and anger about not being able to create authentic social relations is to become obsessed with improving his position in the social hierarchy of college. GM tyree. In his paper, the dislike button says one of the problems of facebook is that it's like the Ikea of the mind. We riding users who generate an endless flow of good news and consumable tidbits of their own interiority, stream of folks' consciousness. That next one seem more cheerful, more entrepreneurial, and more boring than anyone, but someone ever wants to be friend. This is what we see in Mark's personality. Instead of trying to mend broken relations, the solution, it's a train peer, more successful hoping that people were accepting,

Speaker 2:          07:26          hey, that was great. That was the right thing. You apologize.

Speaker 1:          07:38          At the end of the movie, Marcus destroying every authentic social relationship, living more in the social fantasy of facebook. Why it in? As Justin Timberlake's character says, yeah, mark's former best friend. Still try it one more time to finally break to thus revealing a desire for intimacy for a messy but real human contact.

Speaker 2:          08:03          Yes. You wish your 24 million new shares of stock. You were told that if you investors come up on your shares diluted, how much were his, you signed the papers you sent me. You're going to blame me because here were the business head of the company and you made a bad business deal with your own company. It's going to be like I'm not a part of facebook won't be like you're not a part of facebook. You're not a part of facebook names on the masthead. You might want to check again cause I froze the account. I think we were going to let you parade around in your ridiculous suits pretending you were running the second broad.

Seriously, what the hell is the chicken and all back what? You hated the off, so they identified me as a cofounder of facebook, which I am, you bet our lawyer up asshole because I'm not coming back for 30% I'm coming back for everything.

Speaker 1:          09:17          In the end. This film is just an interpretation of the events and great as a facebook, he had a gift, some strong critique on facebook backers in a wild story off power, friendship and betrayal suggesting in the end that the most successful social network in the world was created by someone who else just trying to fit in.
