Speaker 1:          00:00          I'm sure that you've heard that a plane crashed and Coil Berry kill

Speaker 2:          00:18          early 21st century

Speaker 3:          00:21          today, our fellow citizens, our way of life, our very freedom came under attack in a series of deliberate and deadly terrorist acts. The attacks on nine 11 not only shook up in nation, but they woke the entire world from a decade of relative tranquility. After the end of the Cold War, the data towers fell would mark the beginning of a political scientist, Samuel Huntington coin, the clash of civilizations, the West versus the rest. Now what are you resonate with? This concept is up to you, but he most certainly did. Either you're with us where you are with the terrorists

Speaker 4:          01:02          and in the war against terror. It's this frame of mind that will reaffirm American identity and its role in the world dramatically.

Speaker 2:          01:22          So I think the 2004 puppet sets higher team America will police does a great job in depicting this proposed American view of the war on terror. The story is about Acthar and spy and Gary Johnson and his counter terrorism team as they take on terrorists worldwide wide. And ultimately you have to confront the biggest terrorist of all the late dictator of North Korea. Kim Young, ill professional, James Gow argues that the film reflects the of this realists interpretation of international relations. Now what does that mean? Constructivism is basically to clean. That's significant aspects of international relations are historically and socially constructed and not the consequence of human nature. Realism on the other hand, can be thought of as unified by the belief that rural politics ultimately is always and necessarily a field of conflict among actors pursuing power. Now if you're thinking, I don't understand this at all, don't worry, the film was a brilliant job in explaining the basic gist of it.

Speaker 5:          02:17          There are three kinds of people, Dick Pussy, pussy take, everyone can get along and takes, just want to fuck all the time without thinking it through. But then you got your ass check and all the assholes. One got shit all over everything.

Speaker 2:          02:33          So does a little bar room wisdom about sexual relations actually turns out to be the most important scene of the movie as it's ultimately what saves humanity from nuclear annihilation. The more importantly it lays bare to films, philosophical core, the decks in the old man's story, our team America, and an effect. Everyone who acknowledges and support as America's assumed real life role as beliefs force of the world. The all American white and blonde team represents the hyperbole of patriotism, dressed in American flag combat gear, and moving around in a similar style vehicles. The team operates all over the globe with a well known American bravado when the sense of optimism, their self confidence in their rule as self, a clean police of the world. There's also their main weakness. Although the team is effective in stopping terrorists around the globe and it's often crude and clumsy methods, they end up doing more damage than the terrorists themselves.

Speaker 6:          03:26          [inaudible]

Speaker 2:          03:44          Damn, I missed him, but it would be false to say that the movie is enzyme American. On the contrary, you to characters who publicly opposed to team notably to members of the film actors guild or arguably made fun of the most met the members of fag or the policies of the word. They don't believe that violence will sub terrorism and don't want America to act as a police force of the world. However, as the old man pointed out, who sees our only one and a half inches away from the assholes, and indeed in a criticism of team America, the actress slowly started to turn into terrorists themselves.

Speaker 2:          04:21          The hassles of the movie art a terrorists and Kim Jung, Il, they don't care about anything but the destruction of modern civilization. And all of these characters are portrayed and overtly stereotypical way. In a Alaria segment, the team give Gary and quote unquote elaborate makeover. So blend in with the terrorists. Now you would expect to see a new person as he comes out of the surgery, but instead he returns with some brown paint on the skin and pubic hair on its face and its whole resembling a turban on his head. The joke reaches its climax is gary has to pass to Garza without raising any suspicions. Buck, Dirk, dirk or la?

Speaker 6:          04:57          Okay.

Speaker 2:          04:57          Durka Durka Mohammed Jihad.

Speaker 6:          05:00          Yeah.

Speaker 2:          05:01          Oh, darker. Darker, darker in North Korea. Kim Jung. Il speaks broken English and lives in the city of Chinese takeout boxes. Wait, a round ring. Oh Man. All of this reinforces the constructivism president in the film. The way the world is portrayed as the way America chooses to perceive it, and it's this red or naive view that causes the team to have so many enemies. However, Gary does realize in the end and chooses to come to terms with it. Maca can definitely do better in their role as world police, but they're constructivist. Realist view does triumph and although the actors don't wish to accept this day to ultimately see violence, it's the only means to protect her own values. We can't look weak and powerless. If violence is all those bastards understand that violence they'll get. So despite all the heat, you American managers to dismantle a cumulus, devious plan and save humanity from certain night. Elation as philosopher and Admin Berg once famously stated you only thing necessary for the triumph of evil is for good men to do nothing. Or as the movie like suits explain it.

Speaker 5:          06:05          I don't know much in this crazy, crazy world, but I do know that if you don't let us fuck this asshole, we're going to have our dicks and are pussies

Speaker 2:          06:19          all covered in shit. It's this sense of pragmatic realism that writer and director, Trey Parker and Matt Stone are trying to convey. It's you. America won't beliefs and quiet. Paradoxically it seems that's the America's goal to prevent and destroyed terrorism all around the globe will never be finished. Their view of the world means that there will always be a new terrorist in new enemy to fight. And so far to the theory seems to have rung true in real life as well. But in the NTU America doesn't really care about what do you think their dicks and as long as there's assholes in the world, it's all be Dick's willing to fuck them again and again.

Speaker 5:          06:55          Okay.

Speaker 2:          06:56          All right guys, thanks for watching. I hope you enjoyed the video. There's a couple of things that I quickly want to talk about. Uh, so first off, as I'm recording this, we've just surpassed 2000 subscribers and we honestly couldn't be happier with how things have developed over the last couple of weeks. Uh, we never fought. We gain so many followers in this short amount of time and we want to thank you all so much for supporting us and spreading the word. It's, it's good stuff. Now, a lot of you have been giving us constructive feedback on their work so far. Uh, it's mostly people saying that we sound a lot like the nerd writer did that we want to say that. Yes, we do to an extent and honestly, uh, I don't actively try to do so. I think it's mostly unconscious and just the way that I personally like to do my voiceover, uh, I think set that we're both trying to move away from that a little bit and I believe with time our own personal voice will start to shine through more and more. Secondly, you've tried turning down the volume on the background music a little bit, so I believe that shouldn't be an issue anymore. Thanks for pointing it out to us. Finally, I want to invite all of you to follow us on twitter and facebook as we will be posting updates on our channel and media related stuff. So if you want to stay up to date, definitely check that out. That's about it. Thanks again for watching and see you guys in the next one.
