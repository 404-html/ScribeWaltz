Speaker 1:          00:03          Just as from many others. My childhood and adolescence, we're in a way defines by jk rowling, magical world of how we boller growing up about a year or two younger than Harry Potter was in the books when they were released a reds and still reread the magical adventure mysteries that went from children's books to as the neuro titus dates increasingly dark, increasingly nuanced treatments of character and blood. This gradual shift, of course, whilst carefully planned out by jk rowling long before she started writing, she spent several years carefully constructing the full saga and writing extensive background stories for the major characters before she started on the first book. Now, rollings books are filled with references to mythology and other writers. As John granger states, Ronin storytelling reveals traditional artists three with symbols and themes borrowed from Dante Shakespeare, the inklings, and other literary greats I Republican things teams like friendship, good versus evil and racism and oppression. However, I want to focus on what I considered the two most important themes in how we bother. It's philosophy of laugh

Speaker 2:          01:16          debt.

Speaker 1:          01:31          From the very beginning. We can see death. Death's plays a major role in Harry father and it becomes clear that in jk Rowling swirls, death isn't seen in binary terms in the wizarding world to can be nuances between being death and being alive. The primary example of this is of course for the Moritz who chases immortality by two murder, ripping a solo in pieces and storing them in valuable artifacts. He cannot die as long as the pieces of his saw our bounce to earth within these artifacts, I think for the moth is clearly inspired by Gothic fill such as Frankenstein Dracula and Jacqueline and hate all our intelligence scholars who attempt to meddle with the loss of nature with life and death. The law for it already is strikingly clear from the data's there, Carrie. There are doctors counts and involve them. Warts case a lord as John granger stays, they are men of my thin body. Without spirit, there is no end even there. It is out of a bow like many godick villains for the artist is only concerned with the eternal life of his mind and body. Instead of turn the life of his spirit and saw these willing to split and maim has saw into pieces in order to preserve his earthly might embody. Even though he's worn that spending your soul is a terrible natural thing to do and that's a soul is to remain in tech.

Speaker 2:          03:08          Yes,

Speaker 1:          03:10          healing a nation against nature. Proning stake on the soul as separate from the body of course goes against the way by logical and natural scientists, he consciousness, they see physical and chemical processes in the brain as the cost of emotional and rational consciousness which disappears if one dies. The body is all there is the ID off. A separate soul is just a kosher projection. We create. However, although Ronan's notion of splitting a soul in multiple parts is quite original. The idea of a separate soul that needs to remain in tact or in other words and tainted is spite of many religions around the world, and this brings me to my central arguments. That's to Harry pulled the saga is very much influenced by religious and specifically Christian symbolism and narratives. There are many examples, specific symbolism in Harry Potter. That's can be linked to Christianity starting with the name, how he father. Some have suggested that it's over first to Sephora or biblical verses where [inaudible] is another word for God's search as is a a 64 eight but now, oh Louis, the Arthur follow. We are the clay and Dow or other. Well, heavy according to John Granger is a wordplay on air. How we polar is this the era of garth.

Speaker 2:          04:32          Okay,

Speaker 1:          04:32          one question. Push this even further and draw comparisons between Donadoni and Garth, which would mean that Harry and Dumbledore's army represent Jesus and his disciples

Speaker 3:          04:42          professor, he had nothing to do with that. It was me, most noble of you, Harry, but as has been pointed out,

Speaker 1:          04:49          apostrophe cleared. It says

Speaker 3:          04:51          double doors.

Speaker 1:          04:54          Further, draco is the Latin word for boats, dragon and a serpent, which are biblical symbols for Satan. Revelation 22 states. He sees the dragon, that ancient serpent who is the devil and Satan and bound him for a thousand years. Well, malfoy comes from the French malfoy, which translates to Beth or evil faith. DRACO malfoy is this a serpent of evil? Faith. Seven Sophia,

Speaker 1:          05:27          of course, the serpent is seen lots in Harry Potter and it is one of the strongest representations of the devil starting with the serpent. Of course, that's seducers Adam and eve in the garden of Eden. Rolling symbolism based on animals clearly comes from medieval Christian bcra which were animal stories where the animals are infused with biblical meaning in Christian Bcra, the snake and bus least equal representations of Satan. Dare foods are the phoenix and stack while the lion, which is of course the symbol different door represents Jesus. In revelation five five for example, Jesus is referred to as the lion of the tribe of Judah and finally though is a symbol of maternal off

Speaker 2:          06:30          after all this time or

Speaker 1:          06:39          John Granger also makes the argument that and Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets, the sort of Griffendor is a symbol for the Christian Cross. Thus Harry as a representation of Jesus fights off the devil bus, at least with a sword that is symbolic of the Christian Cross. I could go on, but I would refer you to John Granger's book looking for God and Harry Potter for more symbolism on the brother and narrative level. The Harry Potter. Sarah can of course also be seen as a Christian narrative. It is an essence, a story about laugh, more specifically sacrificial laugh conquering

Speaker 2:          07:20          Beth.

Speaker 1:          07:30          The forces that defeat evil and Harry Boulder are almost always forces of good. They are healing tears, sort that appears through bakery and loyalty, a strong force of happiness and of course laugh itself. La Fin Christianity put Texas saw and pro fence a terrible faith in the afterlife and like Jesus died for our sins. Harry sacrifices himself to protect his loved ones

Speaker 1:          08:05          after which he has resurrected in front of his disciples. Now I myself as an atheist, well most days and an agnostic on Psalm, was quite surprised to find search, strong Christian influences in books. Death defined my childhood, yet I wouldn't effort dismissed the many lessons that can be found in how he father John granger describes how reporter as novels that satisfy a spiritual hunger in a secular society, seasoned them. The power of traditional Christian literary arts. And although I agree for the nonreligious I see in Harry Potter or a story that is perfect to introduce to children or for grownups to reflect upon the normality and inevitability of death. In Harry Potter, a fear of death is seen as a filter relation with death. Although trout, he put her many people in some way come back from the afterlife. This is always described as a temporary or negative experience.

Speaker 1:          09:04          People resurrected by the resurrection stone are unhappy and don't belong on earth anymore and of course there's for them worth who was fear of death lease into evil, x of murder and damaging a saw. This slowly turns him less and less human, which is emotive debt and trey to yield cof traces back to Oscar Wilde's picture of Dorian Gray. It's voting's fishing of death and Harry Puller is death. Death can infect be transcendence. One can truly become the master of death by living with laugh and creating death as an old friend when he comes. We see this when Harry is in limbo after for the more it's quote unquote kills him where Dumbledore tells him he can move on if he wants to.

Speaker 2:          09:47          All right, thank you. So desire, you'll be able to board a train ready to take me on.

Speaker 1:          10:00          But I think there's also an important nonreligious lesson on death, which can be seen in how he bother the lesson of accepting the debt or friends and loved ones. The lesson of realizing that the death live on in our hearts and in our memories as Albus dumbledore tells us in the third book and Cvs Stenosis in the third movie,

Speaker 2:          10:22          it's cruel that I got to spend so much time with James and Lillian new, the little note this, what's the lovefest never, rarely leaves and you can always find it here

Speaker 1:          10:43          and I think it is this lesson that lace at the core of the story of how he father in book seven Luna answers the question from the ego of Raven claw by suggesting that a circle has no beginning all the loft ones. Harris last live farm as an inseparable part of him and although ODF dice in a way, their circles continue because by giving their names to his kids, Lily James Serious and the others Devonne as much in Harris children as they live on in himself.
