Speaker 1:          00:02          I've always found it intriguing that Martin Scorsese, goodfellas starts it. Story here, a car on a deserted road. Our protagonist, Henry Hill, behind wheel is travel companions dozing off in the background. No dawn's, no Tuxedos, no highbrow melodrama, just three guys sitting in a car trying to pass the time, a scene, so mundane and so relatable. Other than these few fleeting seconds you along with our companions here would almost forget that this is a gangster movie. Of course, Chris says he's just setting us up for an early shock reveal and just like that. We stopped relating and it's through relative ease in which Tommy and Jimmy finished off her begging victim. That throws us off even more. Yet we're intrigued. Social Studies switch the focus to Henry, his face lit, read like he's staring straight into hell itself. We didn't invites us to join him and be our guide in this journey of the bace in sin and what's become known as one of the most famous lines in gangster film history. As far back as I can remember, I always wanted to be a gangster

Speaker 1:          01:17          opening credits barely having passed by. We can already tell that Scorsese, yes, they can have 180 degree turn away from another a gangster movie because instead of directing his attention upwards on larger than life characters at the very top of the mafia hierarchy, score says he chooses to put the spotlight on the blue color gangsters down below in the streets of Queens. New York didn't find this focal point and attempted gays. Have an everyday kid who's only desire is to become somebody in a world of nobodies and restore your, of course is an adaptation of Nicholas Pileggi book, White Sky, which chronicles the life in crime with the real Henry Hill Square says you supposedly was so impressed by the gritty realism and attention to detail the boot that he decided to treat his movie adaptation like a stage documentary, and we'd attempt to at least preserve the spirit of adaptive manner. The most obvious result of which is conveyed in score says you still have the voiceover.

Speaker 1:          02:16          One day. One day, some of the kids from the neighborhood carried my mother's groceries all the way home. It would perhaps be more fitting to rebrand Henry's recurring voiceover as a sort of audio commentary about his own rise and fall. It's almost like we're watching the footage with Henry in every now and then. He pauses the film at various important points you provide us with additional information. Henry's wife, Karen, is also featured in the voiceover which adds to the talking heads documentary like feel of the movie which were says he stopped just short of actually showing us Henry watching and compensating on the food issue himself. The end result of the strive for realism is that we get the feeling that what we're watching is truly authentic slice of life for you to over romanticizing with actors behaving redder than acting, but quite paradoxically. It's precisely this aspect of the movie that makes us get drawn into Henry's experiences even more. Your watch closely how Henry guides us through his teams as you rationalizes away, why he chose the life right up until the point that we see him as a full grown self proclaimed wiseguy. From that point on, we hang out with his friends at the bar you listened to and laugh at Zombie stories. We share a shock as the tension builds and we realized that laughing might not have been such a great idea after all

Speaker 2:          03:36          to talk.

Speaker 1:          03:42          We Watch Henry find love. We even get to see his personal holiday. Pictures were sucked in. We rapidly become part of Henry Story to such an extent that at times we experience it through his own eyes or as a sort of extension of himself as he introduces us to all of his wife's guy friends in the bamboo bar, but of course there's really only one scene that captures this feeling perfectly. Copacabana scene really is the apex of seduction in the film and this three minute long tracking shot. We're positioned right behind Henry and Karen who are going on our first serious date in the background, a song. Then he kissed me by crystal, starts to play a playful oh, to seduction itself by taking it back to her entrance. Henry shows that he's no longer waiting around like everyone else, ironically is a sentence. You power is then shown by the sense into the basement door magically opens for a couple when we entered a lower corridors of the venue, athlete colored red as if the two F major descends into the realms of the underworld or hell itself everywhere at a law.

Speaker 1:          04:43          People read. Henry is Karen walks beside him and that's a shot. Moves on and dawns on us at the scene isn't just all about Henry's moving with Karen. No Scorsese has stated himself. It's also about the lifestyles to deucing him because it symbolizes Henry's achieve goals of recognition and social mobility as he moves into the club from the back and ends up right at the center of the stage. It's a brilliant scene which captures what scholar folio or Zito as called the kinetic energy of the film perfectly, and it's this energy that binds Scorsese's dry for real, as tendency towards expressive stylization that you get her, which seduce us as much as it does Henry and Karen. It's an energy that moves the story forward and provides them with an almost unending momentum is the ease with which things come. The amount of freedom and control henry has over his own life that transport him forward.

Speaker 1:          05:35          I could do anything. The fact that Henry says this while he was parking cars as a fitting metaphor for his sense of mobility and especially considering the historical context with the fifties, with cars being produced en masse and President Eisenhower proposing to interstate highway plan in 1955 square says he then use it as newly increased freedom of movement as a Motif for both Henry's as well as the film's own momentum as can already be observed here in the opening. Credits for Henry car signify a sense of total control as he sees himself as a driver of his own life. This feeling gives henry the impression that he can do whatever you desires, like blatantly cheating on his wife and dealing in cocaine despite of the fact that Bali told them not to and he's busy living life in the fast lane, separated from the rest of us until he isn't.

Speaker 1:          06:28          Perception does build on and sustained by the loss of freedom for some and the loss of life or others are protagonists are always scared of losing control or being perceived as someone who founded, which is white, Tommy you can handle being put down and why Jimmy becomes increasingly paranoid after the Loofah is our rate, is this combination of fear and greed that ultimately puts a full stop to the momentum of Henry's fruit, a year long ride, and we come to the conclusion that despite having had everything actually had very little sense of control, has always been in the hands of Bali. His friends can turn into enemies in mere seconds, so he ends his story where he left off in the state of motionless as a rat. Moving then drives away from his new house, signifying the life, leaving him behind, and we of course is aware that we've been watching as he breaks the fourth wall right here and the court can mean anything.

Speaker 1:          07:19          I was broke or he has consciously been our guide, our brotherly demon throughout the film, and we empathize with him because his desire is to an extent our own henry's been seduced by life and he doesn't regret it, and according to Scorsese, we are all sinners and we can all empathize with the characters to do is my money and power because those beginning shots of Henry staring out of his window reflect not only his own longing for wealth recognition and control, but also and perhaps more importantly, our own voyeuristic gaze into our protagonist, sinful in the grief world, and we just just helped us open up the blinders to give us a better look consumer life because he knows all too well that although we've just been watching from the sidelines, there's something very deep inside of us all that might just be asking you

Speaker 3:          08:07          four more.

Speaker 1:          08:18          Right guys. That's the end of yet another video analysis. As always, I hope you enjoyed the. There's just so much substance to goodfellows that it's just really too much to talk about. Uh, but I hope I managed to capture the main gist of it, this video. Well, if you do want to know more, I will upload my additional video commentary on Goodfellas on our Patrion page tomorrow. So check that out. If you love what we do and helps us out tremendously, then I'd like to thank offer Fulvio or Zito for his article on realism and formalism, but trust the main inspiration for this video. And of course, Michael Tucker from lessons of the screenplay for helping me improve my audio quality just a little bit. It's still not perfect, but I think we're slowly getting there. All right. Thank you all for watching and see you in the next one.
