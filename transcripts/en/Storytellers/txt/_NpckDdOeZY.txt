Speaker 1:          00:00          Thank you to skillshare for sponsoring this video.

Speaker 2:          00:16          The clash of giant men and monsters is eight powerful image that has a beard in many religion, mythology and forth till throughout the ancient world, and it's a concept that in our secular, modern world continues to live on in the somewhat different form. Guillermo del Toro specific written is one of those manifestations and although at very consciously embraces the silliness of the genre, it nonetheless managers do transcend the cliche by hinting edits, very deep symbolic patterns of society and the individual of how a world or a center can come both to be destroyed and reborn on the edge or the rim of the world.

Speaker 3:          01:07          Yeah.

Speaker 1:          01:07          To begin with, the story gives us a mythological version of the modern world. Deep in the Pacific Ocean appears a riff to a dark dimension of giant monsters. We rubbed out of the water as out of primordial chaos. The fact that the rift manifests in the Pacific Ocean is not arbitrary because according to how we have mapped in organize the world, even though the world is a globe, it is nonetheless there in the Pacific Ocean that the rim of the world is located where East becomes west, where time jumps from one day to another. Her rift in spaced imaged as the gate of Haiti's out of which chaos and death erupt, and so following the analogy, the edge, the rim of the world in terms of space is also where appears the possible end of the world as cataclysmic destruction of all civilization. The possibility of the end appears in the form of the Kaijene we're emerging out of the water are monsters in the fullest sense of that word depicted here as undefinable hybrid creatures mixtures of humanized forms and diverse animal characteristics. They remind us of the universal sea monster that has appeared all over the world in the form of the Leviathan, the Crackin, trib dis are Cilla. All of these creatures come together as a representation of chaos and the destructive forces of nature. As rally points out,

Speaker 4:          02:39          there are things you can fight, acts of God. You see a hurricane coming, you have to get out of the way for when you're in a yeager, suddenly you can fight the art game. You can win.

Speaker 1:          02:53          However, the eruption of chaos, which happens on the edge is not just accidental, but simultaneously appears as an invasion of a foreign race of aliens because if what lies outside the wall of the city is the danger of the natural world, it is also the unknown stranger as possible invader. And so unlike other movie monsters such as Godzilla who represents rod destruction, the Kyde, you linked several aspects of the rim and the periphery together linking closer to cosmic symbolism, the somewhat humanoid forms of these monsters. The fact that they often walk on two legs also links the more general sea monster to the image of the clash of titans or the giants which appear in almost all cultures as preceding the civilized world. Having had to be defeated in a war or destroyed in a flood in order to make way for a current age and just like the ancient ages of giants founding myth, we're told the dinosaurs were Kaijene as well, linking the edge of the world where chaos erupts with an ancient forgotten time populated by monster

Speaker 2:          04:08          to answer this unending emergence of chaos from the rim. Humanity joins hands to bring forth an army of giant human controlled robots or yeager's. But what makes it so intuitively right that Earth's line of defense should come in the form of a giant man. The strange satisfaction of the Mecca robot is that it is a man that the skill of society at giant weapon to defend the world and vision as the physical embodiment of the spirit, which represents a communion. It's the image of the Saint Michael figure who brings order food defeating to gray dragon of chaos by slashing him with his sword. It's division of the giant man representing the community and if the Commonwealth represented and Thomas Hobbes own version of the Leviathan. This premise of the Jaeger as the embodiment of communion appears. First of all, in the name of the yeager leader Marshall Pentecost for pentecost as to possibility of finding unity among diversity when the Holy Spirit made it possible for people with all languages to understand each other and so to the Jaeger program has shown as diverse peoples and cultures joining together to fight a common enemy or more succinctly. The very efficiency of the yeager. Robots depends on two or more people coming together into perfect unity, communing or drifting together with all their memories, their faults, and with all their willpower. Like any society or people who share a common identity like the two sides of a brain, like the opposites which characterize the human person, creativity and discipline, justice and mercy, freedom and submission to societal norms.

Speaker 3:          05:42          It's not obvious. It is Mr [inaudible].

Speaker 2:          05:48          He defensive. Unity can only be possible when opposites come together into focus and common purpose, but the Jaeger is not only an image of communion, but an image of the edge itself, an extension of technology as the expansion of human capacity. Clothing is the most primordial image of technology. The most immediate gloving is protection of weakness and increase in the power to master to hostilities of the outside, so like a giant night of cosmic proportions, the yeager's, both an armor and a weapon which can move into the periphery to meet the challenge which appears on the edge

Speaker 1:          06:29          in their status and in the expression of the characters. The Jager team itself has depicted as representatives of the margin. They are the exception. They are a rag tag group of drift compatible couples and they are pushed out of the center and discarded when in their overconfidence things start to go downhill and a society now ops to hide from chaos behind a giant sea wall instead. Visually the move towards the edge is represented as a descent. This image is repeated over and over. The head of the Jager with its human agents descend unto the body than the Jager is dropped into the waters and ultimately the jager moves to the bottom of the ocean floor in order to descend even into the pit, into the chaos of the underworld where the monsters come from

Speaker 2:          07:23          and where to yeager's were at first part of the military hierarchy of the center. They now adopt an identity more closely aligned with the hybrid heroes at the frontier and they haven't been sort of the graded into the resistance and I have them talk in the language of a western Marshall Ryder outpost, Jaeger jokey. You'll see when they moved, they sound like cowboys instead of dealing with governments, they are now forced to do business with those that dwell in the shadows in between worlds. This in between. This is also noticeable in the resemblance of the yeager and decayed you firstly in their name, which are permutations of each other, but also in their mirrored appearance as giant extensions of their societies engineered by either side to fight monsters. We created monsters of our own, the yeager's, our emissaries and guardians of order. On the one hand, but as giant weapons of nuclear proportions.

Speaker 2:          08:18          They also like the hive mind control guide. You embodied it potential for mass destruction and here in lies both the necessity and the danger of the descend in order to effectively overcome the unending destruction caused by the riff. The yeager crews are forced to both voluntarily and involuntarily be touched by chaos. Riley loses his brother and this left with a print of the cage he was making on his body, causing him to resigned to a red or meaningless life behind the wall. His partner, Mako, on the other hand, is touched by the chaos of the Chi Jew and a more mental way, which takes the form of a severe childhood trauma, which has controlled her life in a quest for vengeance that almost leads or to point a gun at her own kind. Decreased scientist. Newton, on the other hand, Holt's an unhealthy desire to be connected with the guide you, which consequently leads into learn the secret of their origin, but it paradoxically also gives them the information they need to figure out the intentions of the Jaegers as well as his own present location. It's

Speaker 1:          09:20          fighting chaos on the edge in this dissent in which we can both obtain the power and the knowledge to emerge victorious, but in which there's also the danger of becoming consumed by it perishing or even reemerging as the very same thing we had wanted to overcome.

Speaker 5:          09:38          Okay.

Speaker 2:          09:40          In the end, the men and women of the Jaeger program have to consciously find a balance on this slippery slope in between order and chaos, and it's not only in the balance that's found in this relationship or this harmony of opposites, but it's the individual as the place where unity and resolution finder most immediate form. All of these characters have to reassess their opinions and their compulsions in order to to get our take up the sword. One last time in this final clash, they learned that it is not only an opposition, that the guide you are to be defeated. It's by merging with them in a strange manner that unlocks the gate for a yeager to make it's final descend into the underworld. This descend into the underworld can be seen as the embracing of chaos without being defeated by Riley writing to guide you in to the rift.

Speaker 2:          10:32          This like Gandalf riding the Balrog through the Ebis, and ultimately it is an image of Christ, descendants who Haiti's and ultimate resurrection, his trampling down death by death. It's this voluntary acceptance of the existence of chaos, both without and within and coming together in communion. Despite that, that the last act of courage and sacrifice culminates into a single act of the human person in a moment of solitude, destroying the power of the underworld and finally closing to rift the return to the surface as dare for shown as a rebirth, as the emergence of a new world free from the madness of destruction, but also the rebirth into a world where the two opposites of Riley and Mako find themselves united floating on an island in the vast ocean. As the final image of a new beginning.
