Speaker 1:          00:00          Thank you to squarespace for sponsoring this video.

Speaker 1:          00:07          I think we can all agree that rogue one is by no means a conventional entry into the Star Wars Saga, the black and gray undertones of the opening sequence, and it's boots on the ground, no nonsense approach to it. Story for veal early on that the film is the odd one out at a midst a long series of familiar expectations taking place in between the overall darker and best and mystic revenge of the sith and the more hopeful and optimistic and new hope. It functions as a mediator of what we can call the Yin and the Yang of the star wars saga. Bridging not only to chronological gap in the timeline, but also and more importantly, symbolically crossing the underlying tonal divide that exists between these two films. This voyage begins close through the darkness of revenge of the Sith, the young gender or so, and her family who have been hiding in the shadows of the galaxy are found by the tyrannical empire who proceed to shoot her, define mother and forced her genius fodder, Gayland Urso to finish constructing the death star with the archetype of a rental.

Speaker 1:          01:08          Figures effectively eliminated the film's opening. Sequence not only sets up Jen's backstory as to protagonist, but it also symbolically establishes the main dominating theme or undertone of roughly the first half of the film, which is the world at the bottom and in the shadow. Fifteen years down the line, jen is shown to have become a criminal and a prisoner in a remote imperial labor camp, having grown disillusioned and cynical throughout the year, she doesn't rejoice at the prospect of being rescued by the rebels, but attempts to fight them off. Instead. Her nihilistic worldview has made, are numb to any sort of belief or dream anymore benevolent future. Her only interest are selfish in nature and grounded at the bottom in the material world. You can stand to see the imperial flag. Brain crossed,

Speaker 2:          01:57          not a problem if you don't.

Speaker 1:          01:59          The rebel alliance on it's Bart is shown, fractured its members, anxious and divided, separated by conflicting opinions on the conduct of war. It's agents operating on the fringes of morality. Gas. Ian is one of these agents and represents this inner conflict in his struggle to live with the questionable things he sees himself forced to do in servers off the rebellion, the alliances, motives are seemingly egoic and dishonest in nature, only having rescued gin as a means of getting to her father and lying to her about the ultimate goal of the mission.

Speaker 2:          02:31          Forget what you heard in that there will be no extraction. You find him.

Speaker 1:          02:37          This morally slippery slope is accentuated by two character of Saul Guerrera, the former mentor of gin and the leader of an extremist rebel cell function somewhat as a cautionary tale for the alliance as a whole. He and his men have been engaged in a brutal war against the empire and the city of Jeddah booting civilian lives in danger and combating the imperials over who the moral high ground in the city hiding in a crumbling desert cave with his window into the world shattered saw has slowly become more machine than men having grown exceedingly paranoid of others as his sanity and humanity dwindled along the way.

Speaker 1:          03:17          Moving beyond the merely human representation of the world. At the bottom is the entire planet of Jetta, a small desert. Planet. Jetta was once a spiritual world of worship for forest believers and to jet. I order. However, when we get to see is a world in decline, the giant statues of Ancient Jetta I have fallen and are crumbling. It's city upon a hill like John winthrop's, Massachusetts Bay colony. It was once a place for people to look up to a place of honor, hope, justice, and the highest possible good in rogue one. However, the city has fallen into decay. It streets ravaged by war. It's skies shrouded by a pyramid shape, star, destroyer and ultimate symbol of bloated order, and it's amongst roaming the streets without purpose as dare temple is actively being plundered of its most valuable resource guide holding these star crystals were formerly used to make jet I lightsabers and our sources of the force of the light in the darkness representing such things as order justice and moral good gins, necklace holes, one of these stones which is noticed by the blind monk Chirrut the first thing this quote seems to address as Jen's inner journey, perhaps implying that she should listen to to deepest urgings over hard to let go of her apathetic nature and to move yourself upwards towards a higher purpose to become a beacon of light in the darkness.

Speaker 1:          04:38          The second preference comes into form of the newly constructed Deathstar, which powered by the ems crystals from Jetta possesses eight literal heart of Geiber to director Orson Krennic. This literal manifestation gold, a star powered by Dick Lehman Crystal will ultimately translate into a better world to providing peace cured. However, it is notion of the absolute order of light becomes instead something pathological and highly destructive, symbolically suggesting that a world with too much light or too much order is just as bad as a world consumed by darkness and chaos. These two notions of lightness as moral good and the danger of the excess of light then come together at the climax of the jetta sequence gins, existing inner cynical beliefs are shattered when she's confronted with a Hologram message of her long lost father speaking to her as to symbolical spirit of the fodder to culture and the order that has been consumed by the tyranny of the empire.

Speaker 1:          05:36          He tells her of his true intentions to eight to rebellion and the destruction of the deaths are down by leaving gin with a message of hope and sacrificed to a higher purpose. But at the same time of the resurrection of the wives. Father, his tyrannical counterpart blooms high above shrouding the light of the sun before finally destroying the remnants of the old order like a god thunder on the people of his creation with the land now shrouded in darkness and chaos. It's horizon rendered, nonexistent. Saw Jim's father figure decides that he will run no longer with his sacrifice, symbolizing the embracing of his own darkness and his message of trust in a higher good. The group escapes not only death, but also manages to climb out of the symbolical world at the bottom. The story then starts to take the shape of the archetypical ascension journey that has its hero climb out of the shadow is sending a mountain towards the highest possible, good redeeming or changing himself and the people around him for the better at the top. This upward journey in rogue one is then mirrored by a descend into chaos and into the belly of the beast on the one hand to embrace and overcome every character's personal, dark, side or shadow, and on the other hand, to save the spirit of the fodder which holds the key to the reemergence of hope and a more benevolent order for gaseous. This means that he has to confront the darker nonthinking side of his character in order to free himself from the mental prison. Net clouds is hard. It was more than once

Speaker 1:          07:08          with the ultimate physical death will for fodder. Gin on her part has to finally move beyond her empathetic nature in favor of belief and hope and self sacrifice for a higher good. I would argue that it's this change in these two characters that slowly begins to trickle down into other individuals and eventually the rebel collective as a whole. Jen and her broke one task force are really the tip of the spear of the rebellion. They are at a bow and Arrow, double, ultimately pointy entire alliance into a new direction, embracing both the light and the dark and individually choosing to sacrifice themselves for a greater good, and it's exactly dispersonal sacrifice in service of a better future that allows roque one to make it's final ascend to the top and to broadcast a blueprint of the fodder that holds the key for a better world to reemerge down the line. Because even though does sacrifice will ultimately come at the cost of all of these characters lives, it is not so much shown to be a negative as it is transcendent in his last moments. The imperial defector Bodie overcome this fear and shows courage in his heart as he establishes the radio connection needed for the success of the mission. Witnessing the heroic demise of his friend Charit. This skeptical realist base has a last minute change of heart and finally puts his trust in to force horse.

Speaker 1:          08:28          Even the analytical Kaytoo shows a sign of humanity through his mechanical exterior in the end. It's a line of courageous sacrifice based on hope and trust into force that really all started with the define death of gins. Mother followed by countless other allied characters from saw and galen to numerous named and unnamed rebel marines and air force wings to cash in and jen themselves. Their deaths are marked by an exuberant and transcendent lightness, giving us a sense of redemption in a positively charged sacrifice. And it's here at the battle of [inaudible] that the rebel alliance has really defined setting itself apart from the tyrannical pathology and destructive selfishness of the empire and not just because of its physical action of moving out of the shadow and facing the empire head on. But more importantly, because of the all of inspiring action of a select few individuals, Roque one, demonstrates that to save oneself is to save the galaxy. It's about having the courage to climb out of the bottom of the pit to defy overwhelming darkness, both without and within, and to move upwards and self sacrifice of the ICO itself, in order to retrieve the spirit of the father, it's to emulate his star with a heart of Cairo, to be an inspiration for others to do the same in hopes of manifesting a better future for all.

Speaker 2:          09:48          Nobody's listening.
