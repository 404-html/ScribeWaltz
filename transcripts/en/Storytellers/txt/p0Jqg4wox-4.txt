Speaker 1:          00:17          The opening scene of classic, the Terminator immediately aligns its audience with the films may feet men versus machine. This fee, rum stroud's entire movie as calories and a German etr or sent back in time to duke it out over Sour O'connor's life. Both men and machine are fighting for their very existence. One is trying to killed a mater of mankind, savior walls. [inaudible] seeks to protect her from harm. The Co finance roof, the film Arriann pictures known for classics such as Amadeus and two didn't think very highly of the story and reportedly only perceived the film as a low budget vehicle to make some quick money. Even James Cameron wasn't old at certain off the potential of the film

Speaker 2:          01:05          Terminator One was, was uh, like a hallucination for me. I was making my first, my first picture. I had no idea it was really going to be a success. I mean, when I, when I wrote it, I probably thought it has stood the chance of being a success. I wrote it that way on purpose, you know, but you never really believed that, that it's going to happen or that it can happen.

Speaker 1:          01:23          Arielle and picture saw in the terminator is straight forward action but field to see what lay hidden beneath all the onscreen violence or as the terminator himself explains it.

Speaker 2:          01:34          I always felt that this, this was more than the ordinary action film and it was more than a special effects from and uh, or like with some thought was just a b movie. In fact, I think the story is so solid and so good and it has so many interesting messages there and it is also entertaining and so they will have a broad appeal

Speaker 1:          01:59          because when we look past the surface level, another more encompassing theme revealed itself, religion versus technology, the human spirit versus the program mine. Cause as the story moves into La of 1984, you might expect to see it widely contracting world from the post nuclear wasteland from the star of the movie. However, director James Cameron decided to make la of the ADC gritty, gray and arguably hostile place. Fuck you asshole. Of course

Speaker 3:          03:00          human guy and is still very much alive and in control button is already becoming apparent that the world is in decline. New Technologies such as widespread use of color tvs, board will, cassette players and techno music. I've invaded both the private as well as the public space as people seem to be in the kind of trends oblivious to the world around them. An example is ginger's obsession with her music player. She's dancing around the house, stuck in her own world. First she doesn't hear the ring of her phone, then she doesn't hear Sarah calling her name, gender, it's matte and the first time, well,

Speaker 1:          03:50          another example is the club scene. Where do people dancing are completely oblivious to the and Fred and even in to the existence of our three main characters in general. No one even as much as glances at the massive terminator as he handed it to club and even security is slow to react.

Speaker 1:          04:13          The people of La are not only oblivious, they're also seen to be egotistical and apathetic. The police officers don't seem to care about an act of serial killer systematically terminating all the sour conners in town. Are sure there's a point to all of this. It is only when confronted with potential bad press did they decide to take action hitting me. The press is going to be short stroking and all over the place. Oh, one day pattern together. I hate the weird ones. Even the people whose job it is to listen to you and help out or is it only seems to care about themselves choice. The psychiatrist tasked with analyzing Carl Sanity isn't really listening to him. Yeah, but it's actually just thinking of how a story could elevate his own career surrounded by living tissue. How right. This is great stuff. I could make a career out of this guy and later on when the terminators run over by a truck, you might expect the driver to call for help, but alas,

Speaker 3:          05:09          that's good addict. Good.

Speaker 1:          05:15          Someone Murray's says that has become very hard to spot a Cyborg. It is not only because they look like us, but mainly because when we lose our own humanness, we are starting to act like den. Fuck you, ass whore Sarah and you only ones who exhibit the traits that human kind and terminators seems to have lost. They show compassion to each other and animals alike. I came across time for you, sir.

Speaker 3:          05:47          Have you always have me

Speaker 1:          05:55          disgusting? Sarah's almost naive innocence stands in stark contrast to the world and the people around her, her worth to the world, dramatically shifts from a clumsy waitress to the mater of mankind. Savior. You could even argue that Sarah Connor is an essence, the biblical Maria, her innocence and humanities Cetera, apart from our fellow human beings, her friend Ginger even acknowledges her divine worth better than mortal man deserves and ironically she gets impregnated by somewhat immortal character because even though rees dies in the end, the paradoxical loop has been created and we'll make sure that this event will keep repeating itself forever. God, a person could go crazy thinking about this. Ultimately, she will give birth to John Connor or Jesus Christ who will bring salvation to mankind, who will wake us up right before our own extinction. Robert McKee calls this grove symbolic progression. We start a story with actions, locations, and roles.

Speaker 1:          06:59          The represent only themselves, but a truly great film lists to tell him to the next level. Exposivity from the particular to the universal, from the specific to the archival besides the story of Jesus Christ and the key fines and the terminator echoes the ancient archetype of the maze. The mythological battle between [inaudible] and the minutes are, and indeed most of the action of the film takes place in corridors, hallways, alleyways and the like. The freedom of space in the terminator is limited. Even the chase scene on the highway, it takes place in a tunnel. It closed off environment source. So James Cameron shows us stories that have been taught throughout the ages to confront us with fears of what lies ahead. Determinator franchise has survived up until now, and this might partly be because it's subject is now more relevant than ever. The majority of the world owns a smartphone. Technology literally surrounds us and changes our perception of the world. Hopes and fears of the future. Invention of ai have entered the public arena. James Cameron for saw a dark future for humanity with the terminator, but also provided us with hope of changing the outcome. Silver dust ultimately defeat determinator by working together with the machines of her own time. Yet the front of Doomsday remains. There's a storm coming.

Speaker 4:          08:28          I know.

Speaker 1:          08:30          So next time when you don't understand why a certain film has done so well, look at the progression. Look at the archetypes, because every great new story is often the product of an old one.

Speaker 4:          08:43          I tell you, I owe him that. Maybe it'll help if he, you know that in a few hours that we had together, we left a lifetime's worth my, wait, there's a bench over there.

Speaker 3:          09:15          I'll be back.
