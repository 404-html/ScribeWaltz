Speaker 1:          00:00          Thank you to dollar Shave Club for sponsoring this video.

Speaker 2:          00:02          Okay, let's go five minutes, sir. Let's make some sandwiches.

Speaker 1:          00:30          I think it's done. Let's see,

Speaker 2:          00:44          maybe two hours

Speaker 1:          00:48          cooking and cooked food or almost as ubiquitous in our films, Sdr aspects of our daily lives, but whether you see cooked food as nothing more than fuel to keep your body from buying give it does me. No, no, no, no, no. Get that out right now. Or as a piece of art that almost doesn't deserve to be eaten. Oh my God. People eat because they're hungry. I want to make food and makes people stop eating for eight good filmmaker or writer. The Cuc Ennis food are always more than just a nutter prop in a scene or a cheap way to cover up a lifeless story with some pleasant ICANDY. That's a chef's knife.

Speaker 2:          01:23          Look to hire

Speaker 1:          01:26          the role of the chef as the passionate mediator of raw nature to high culture has served as an APP allegory for the process and frustrations of the Hollywood filmmaker bay. Like the filmmaker to chef is often depicted as a visionary artist of sorts who's creativity has been shackled by his superiors and now suddenly you're going to be an audience will be an artist on your own time or who believes his workers under appreciated? No, she's the Philistines. I'm going live on a dog to add or overly critiqued by those who don't have anything to add themselves for the chef to overcharge us for his insecurity and lack of imagination, but beyond sly allegories the ubiquity of Kooks and hot dishes and cinema can also reveal something meaningful about our humanity and his boot catching fire. How cooking made us human primatologist Richard Wrangham made to controversial but thought provoking claim that this is the act of cooking that is the primary distinguishing feature of humanity. And it has played an enormous part in our evolution as a species. Fucking unbelievable. We are tied to our adaptive diet of cooked food. And the results pervade our lives from our bodies to our minds. We humans are at a cooking apes your creatures of the flame, and so we should indeed been our humanity on Kooks.

Speaker 1:          02:43          In Ratatouille, we can see this notion of cooking as a civilizing process play out in a transformation of remy to country rat and to a five star chef in the culinary capital of the world. Contrary to his fellow rats, remy chooses to walk on two feet, cares about hygiene, self control, just fork it down and learns how to read all because of his passion for cooking. It's only one way to weed a brace of Kone, but if cooked food can be seen as being universally connected to civility films can also use this to show us its opposite.

Speaker 1:          03:23          What did you say? Sorry. Get an old boyd. The main character of the story, he eats a life on cooked octopus both in a desire to touch something living, but also to reveal as d humanize state. After 15 years of isolated imprisonment, he'll fight back on that menu bar, but consuming raw food can also serve more practical purposes. The raw can come to be synonymous with gaining natural strength and adapting oneself. Do an uncivilized environment. Similarly to rules and expectations of a warm meal can be broken to acquaint to civilized with the realities of an uncivilized world.

Speaker 1:          04:10          It's like a piece of chalk called bring it all back, but this desire for the natural and the Ra can also showcase once in capability of building and maintaining civilized human relationships. Food can also be used to indicate it perceived level of Savitri on a societal level, be it in our own community or in those of others depicting morally despicable or highly unconventional foods as markers of uncivility setting more culture protagonists apart from the exotic and wild world which they inhabit, and that when taken to its extreme, can degenerate into perhaps the ultimate symbol for Savitri. Right. We're going to fucking eat your ass. This in turn can be used as a tool to completely break a character or it can serve as a menacing and highly disturbing form of antagonism and in humanity.

Speaker 2:          05:10          Yeah. Nope.

Speaker 1:          05:13          Okay. Okay. Okay. Steven Manel argue set another essential element of civilized food consumption is a regulated appetite. The civilized don't merely eat out of the immediate hunger, but collectively decide when to do so. Together. I love you darling girl. And so it dinner can be to see enough civilized harmony, but it can also be used to invert this harmony, revealing tensions between polar opposite characters and even devolving into gluttony and depravity. Often mockingly depicting in our problems of characters and society's alike. And if over abundance and wastefulness of food are connected to uncivility. So with scarcity, you're going to die for some chickens.

Speaker 1:          06:03          Just like in real life, a lack of food can be utilized to bring about the deepest forms of humanity in people. And at times the very darkest aspects will be characters, personality, cooked food can be a battle ground for perceived moral superiority and higher social status and will be serving those who own the food, have the most of it, or have the final say in how it should be prepared, hold a sense of power over others. And so did we. Zenes of entire countries can come to be the objects of a bitter and at times hilarious rivalry. Similarly, an over abundant fees can shoot agreed and hypocrisy. UV, tyrannical government and the meticulously crafted dessert can be used to reveal the roofless and unpredictable nature of a character who likes to hide behind a gentle masco. Be civilized friend. Send the deposit

Speaker 2:          06:52          doctor I said are totally booked to it. Nine. Perfect. See you then.

Speaker 1:          06:58          Food is a status symbol we can use to impress others with and you Seville our own real personality.

Speaker 2:          07:04          Well, you have to promote general social concern.

Speaker 1:          07:08          It's a symbol through which we can gauge the matter of control a character has over his life and it means through which to maintain an artificial sense of civility juxtaposed against a contrast. In reality you'll be character or of the outside world.

Speaker 2:          07:21          Yeah, we made it dude,

Speaker 1:          07:31          but just as cooked food can height faults, any person or society. It can also serve as a symbol of freedom and hope. I think it's going daddy cooking and cooked food as civilized. There's can be used to bring people together. I know the thing about good food. It brings folks together from all walks of life. We had our people with wildly varying personalities, sculpture or even those in an active state of war II, belly well filled functions as one of the prime factors in creating a civilized environment. It is perhaps no wonder then that we've chosen. The dinner table is one of the prime places from where intimate relationships can grow and bloom. Now you'll know

Speaker 2:          08:10          do we eat? The good food is to be close to God,

Speaker 1:          08:14          meticulously cooked food like an exceptional book. A painting or a great piece of cinema can have a transformative effect on characters and people alike. Bringing back memories this instantly and brings you back to my time and taking our breaths away in a moment of peaceful bliss.

Speaker 2:          08:42          It's so fucking good. I should kill you.

Speaker 1:          08:49          And Cinema as well as in the real world. Cooking and cooked food reveal their connectedness with argument. He by making dose who engage in it, more human, bringing us closer to ourselves and we can link old passions and relationships. This uniquely human trait has gone hand in hand with the evolution of our species from a wild group of primates and two cultured civilizations who owe a great deal to the very first chefs of our race for filmmakers. The interest and usage of cooking and food and film is and perhaps ought to be not just limited to an allegory about the frustrations of art, but it's about cooked food as one of the main civilizing drives of our species because the food we eat in our daily lives and especially to food characters, Cook and consume and movies is in a lot of ways universally connected to the overarching topics of all story, who we are as people and what it means to be human.

Speaker 2:          09:51          Okay,
