Speaker 1:          00:02          Sometimes there was a man, he's the man for his time and place. He fits right in there and that's the dude in Los Angeles and even if he's a lazy man and the dude was most certainly that quite possibly the Las Vegas and Los Angeles County which would place him high and are running for laziest worldwide, but sometimes there's a man, sometimes there's a man.

Speaker 2:          00:43          I think many would agree when I say that the big Lebowski can easily be seen as one of the greatest cult classics off our time to film that as inspire thousands of Halloween costumes, so called Lebowski fest and even a religion must have received poorly upon its original release in 1998. The film was described by critics as fitbit and spacious. It was only in the early two thousands that the film started to get into mess following and appreciation that made it the classic that it is today. It such a steady increasing in popularity is really intriguing. Scholars, Paul Martin and fellow renegot argued that is jus to a period of economic and social prosperity in America when the big Lebowski was released according to them chew to this, many Americans weren't as perceptive to the social critiques that the big Lebowski could offer. This changed however, during the two thousands with impactful events or 9:11, the bloody and problematic war in Iraq and eventually the economic crash of 2008. Then the social and political critique of the Big Lebowski Fountain audience and important critique that can be found in the big Lebowski starts in the opening scene. The narrative makes a point of stating the film takes place during the 1991 Gulf War and that the dudes is just the man for his time. The golf course was a time in American politics where aggression most used as a means of conflict resolution.

Speaker 1:          02:09          This will not stand. This will not stand this aggression against a Kuwait

Speaker 2:          02:14          aggression as a means of conflict. Resolution is a major theme in the movie everywhere around two dudes, all the characters to violence and intimidation to resolve conflicts or pursue their own interests.

Speaker 3:          02:27          Fucking fascist Lebowski,

Speaker 2:          02:36          only the dude because he is of course a pacifist.

Speaker 3:          02:39          These guys, you know, good like me. There was a conscientious objector.

Speaker 2:          02:44          It is not a coincidence that the other Lebowski, the millionaire who was quite willing to use aggression and clearly is the personification of American capitalism. Remarkably looks like the then Secretary of Defense, Dick Cheney, however it is the dude's friend, Walter, who embodies this American policy of aggression during the Gulf War. I'm talking about drawing a line in the sand. Dude, across this line, you do not. Melissa is constantly set off and users aggression and intimidation to achieve his goals.

Speaker 4:          03:16          Just the whole world. God crazy. Am I the only one around here? Just like Jen about the Ra market zero. They're calling the cops man. Put the zero piece of Walter fucking around Taro.

Speaker 2:          03:35          He refers to the goal for when he criticizes to dude for being a pacifist. You know that's your answer for everything and we'll be putting out something. Pacifism is not looking at our current situation with that camel. Fuck her in a wreck. Pacifism is not something to hide behind. Just take it easy, man. I'm perfectly calm. Do you could even argue that what he is yelling in this hilarious scene refers to Iraq treatment of Kuwait and Americans reaction to this.

Speaker 4:          04:03          Let's see what happens when he fucking stranger Larry Flurry, flurry. When you fuck a stranger in the act,

Speaker 2:          04:16          the film is clearly critical of this means of conflict resolution and this of the American politics of starting the Gulf war against Iraq because throughout the film, and especially with regards to Walter Section, the violence only leads to further problems, destruction of their own property, and even a death.

Speaker 4:          04:34          God, they shot him. There weren't any shots fired. It's a heart attack myself, but I'm pumping blood. My pants

Speaker 2:          04:47          well kind of course. Imagine how such a political critique of American politics of progressions as a means of conflict resolutions against Iraq gained popularity in the formations early two thousands when the highly criticized second Iraq war started as Martin and Renner Gar state to both subtle and explicit commentary. The Big Lebowski challenges the values and the dominant national policies of 99 slash one America and celebrates the qualities of the Common Pacific cystic citizen. Yet besides the political critique in the big Lebowski, we can also find a broader critique or society as a whole. I think that that is from this critique that we can explain the cultural impact of the big Lebowski, the Lebowski fest, and the religion of Judaism, which basically preaches going with the flow and taking it easy. Martin and renegot explained this to what they call the carnivalesque qualities of the big Lebowski. The carnivalesque can be explained in different ways, yet it comes down to a way of humor that seeks to deconstruct and ridicule social norms, hierarchies, and power, six, to exposed to artificial construction or society and makes fun of it. Now, the two most important qualities that marked a kind arco desk realism and reversal of hierarchies. Fucking grotesque realism means taking down and ridiculing everything that is considered proper aunts. Respectable. It is lowering everything that is considered holy back to the three of earth and body. Examples of imagery that are a grotesque realism are images of bodily functions, old and fat bodies, sex, pregnancy, and preventing it.

Speaker 4:          06:24          Let me tell you something or you pull any crazy shit with us. You flash a piece out on the lanes they got away from you and stick it up your ass and pulled the fucking trigger. Delayed goes, Jesus. You said in mind, nobody fucks with Jesus

Speaker 2:          06:48          in the big Lebowski. This starts, for example, with the peeing on the rock and the car that smells like urine, but it is also seen in a buddy's of the characters in the big Lebowski. We don't see beautiful movie star buddies. Instead, the camera focuses on overweight middle age guys with beer bellies and food stains on my shirt. It is to this humoristic focus on the lower above lead that the audience is asked to look differently at it. Fucking interesting, man. That's fucking interesting. Grotesque realism can be seen and profanity and overtly sexual dialogue as well. This is used as a way to break through social hierarchies. We can see this, for example, in math, who is very aware of how use of language can break through social convention and create social power.

Speaker 5:          07:31          My art has been commended as being strongly vaginal, which bothers some men. The word itself makes someone uncomfortable,

Speaker 1:          07:38          but Jina oh yeah.

Speaker 5:          07:41          Yes. I don't like hearing it and find it difficult to say, whereas without batting an eye man refer to his dick or his rod or his Johnson Johnson,

Speaker 2:          07:51          funnily enough, however, since the dude is also very unconcerned with social convention and respectability, he is rather and faced a better example, therefore will be bunny. She first becomes characterized as a trophy wife or for rich old millionaire. A woman in her position is often expected to serve as elegant ICANDY and it has a lack of social power, yet too overtly sexual dialogue. She breaks to this convention, the social construction of what is considered respectable behavior and gains in a way social power.

Speaker 1:          08:21          Second Wonderful Woman

Speaker 4:          08:29          Rah, Rah, very fond of are very free spirited brand. Can't watch that. That's marvelous.

Speaker 2:          08:38          This brings me to the second and most important feature of the carnivalesque, the inversion of social hierarchies. This breaks down hierarchies in society, but I did the training of rulers and let alone take their places. This way, the audience has shown the artificial nature of these hierarchies and encouraged to rethink such a system. We already see this in a dude as the protagonist. Instead of the typical American handsome, capable of leading men hero, we get a bathrobe and flip flops wearing bore bomb who stole to be possibly the laziest man in the world. The man for his time and place.

Speaker 6:          09:11          Yeah. Just like your opinion, man.

Speaker 2:          09:17          Yeah. It's the other Lebowski who is referred to by the dude as the big Lebowski, a successful millionaire at the top of the social ladder who gained his wealth by supposedly a life part work turns out to be a total failure in business who lives off an allowance from the trust of his deceased spouse and to refer back to the relevance of the Gulf War and the dudes dream, the supposedly fearful, powerful dictator. Saddam Hussein is working as a bowling shoe attendant offering. The dude that unique pair of silver and gold bowling shoes is reinforces to do kidney position and show Saddam Hussein and the lowly status that's modern and renegade states, so such inverted rows. The audiences enabled to see social reality as a construct under this encouraged to question it in the end. This is one of the key concepts of the film. It puts us viewers to be aware of the constructed nature of society and shows us we are not obliged to take part in it. The dude is living a lifestyle completely in opposition to Alice, respectfully seen as the American dream. Yet he is content living by its own ethics and sense of purpose as he says.

Speaker 6:          10:21          Yeah. Well,

Speaker 2:          10:26          the dude abides to construction nature of society who doesn't conform to it. Instead, he's out there taking it easy for us all and invite us to do the same

Speaker 6:          10:39          band song in Turkey or b days.

Speaker 2:          10:46          All right. Thanks so much for watching everyone. So it took a while to make this video.
