Speaker 1:          00:14          in the short video essay. I want to explore a contradiction I noticed when we watching two excellent film centered around American slavery, 12 years a slave and Django unchained, 12 years a slave of course tells the true story of Solomon Northup Free New Yorker, who is abducted and sold into slavery for 12 years before is fried. Now. Twelve years of slave is a heavy drama that carries the full weight of the horror of slavery. Django unchained, however, is in many ways the total opposite. I can't see fucking shit outage. We ready or what? Oh, hold on. I'm not going with my whole Django definitely has moments where the horrors of slavery are conveyed through brutal and difficult scenes. Yet it is also a term Tino film featuring violence as spectacle and a big dose of comedy. I said Ms Dot Lowe, goodbye, but this created as is not uncommon with county, no controversy.

Speaker 1:          01:16          Media scholar, Glenda Carpio notes that the discourse of race and slavery in America has mostly gravitated towards steep seriousness and sensitivity. Django unchained, therefore raise the question if certain film genres such as Komani are inherently inadequate for capturing the history of slavery, can turn and be forgiven for not adhering to historical accuracy, but it's not be forgiven for striking the quote unquote wrong tone, addressing such a sensitive subject, Michelle, to load the this discussion as well of historical authenticity instead of historical accuracy as he argues is not only the your executive dudes over stoke or representation, but also the context of its consumption that's determines its meaning. Critics of Django this argued that its approach of humor and filing spectacle hurts and trivializes not only the memory of slavery, but also institutional racism that fullerton under Jim Crow and the discussion about racism and race that is prevalent in American society today.

Speaker 1:          02:18          I would argue though that this is untrue, the different tonal style stanton, new uses in Jenga and change each shift to own function. In my analysis of inglorious bastards, I discussed how Terentino's violence, both s entertaining spectacle and as something brutal and horrific as, for example, white crackers pointed out, he does the same in Django and chains to violence against black slaves, his crew, horrific and hard to watch. Just as in 12 years a slave. It drives home the horrible and gruesome history of slavery. Terentino's reserves is useful. Filings as spectacle and fun for the slave holders and other characters who represent the ideology of racism and slavery.

Speaker 1:          03:15          No, I find Terentino's use a few more of the most interesting tonal aspect of the film. Well, it's Terentino's I think realizes is that humor does not affect trivialize slavery, birth and it has the capacity to ridicule and it's been a ride. I log that, uphold slavery, taking away its power and providing a form of Catharsis. My name is Dr King Schults. This is my triangle. These our horses totally fits. This power of comedy is also recognized by a comedian such as key and peele and Dave Chappelle who also ridicule and make fun of the ideology of slavery. Not to trivialize it, but to take away its power. Examples of this are seen in Django unchained where supposedly terrifying clan rate is juxtaposed with ridiculous discussion about being unable to see two white bags.

Speaker 2:          04:04          Fuck all y'all. Hold on. Going on. No, I watched my wife work. Oh, day. Get 30 bags together for you. Ungrateful Sons of bitches and all. I've been here to criticize, criticize, criticize. Don't ask me for nothing

Speaker 1:          04:21          or key and peele skits were two slaves. Feel rejected when they are not being bought during the slave auction.

Speaker 2:          04:27          It's all chins over. It ain't over. It's not over. I'm strong y'all. I'm very shy. I can sleep in a bucket. I'm fast. I got stamina. I don't look at. I know magic. My worst quality is that I'm a perfectionist. I haven't mentioned this. Dust Silent. I am agreeable to a fault.

Speaker 1:          04:46          There was also a striking similarity between the scene where Django shoots, slave master, slave, and Dave Chappelle skit where he travels back in time to confront a slave owner.

Speaker 2:          04:57          He had made lanes and even get new shoes on deck. I could never go out like that. So you really free. Yes, that's true. He didn't pull it out. A whip. Nice whip. There's there's a pistol. Reach Foolish Guy, hungry. No,

Speaker 1:          05:37          that's Glenda Carpio. Rq spoke, Chappelle and Tino use their mediums to affect scenes of retribution against slavery. Using humor to boats sharpened the edge if that ritual and to highlight the artificiality of representations in my few boats. Twelve years of slave and Django and are excellent films. Birth Django unchained should not be criticized for its use of humor around sensitive subjects to slavery and race. To do so would be for guests to healing qualities that comedy can have. All right, thank you all for watching. So due to a busy month, I wanted to do a slightly shorter video essay about power that's company can have in discussing difficult subjects, something that seems to be forgotten more and more these days.
