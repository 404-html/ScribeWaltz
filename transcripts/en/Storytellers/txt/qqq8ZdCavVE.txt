Speaker 1:          00:00          But I'll give you one quick example, I say, and it's fairly standard because I believe it strongly, the American dream is dead, but I'm going to make it bigger and stronger and better.

Speaker 1:          00:13          I think it's safe to say that social tensions within Western society have risen dramatically since the century. How do you elicit concepts like multiculturalism and the American dream has come under increasing amounts of scrutiny from all sides of the political spectrum and the Mitsui growing suspicion, discontent over matters like government, race, ethnicity, gender, and religion. There's the realization that we've become so self aware that we've become too scared to even have an honest debate about these very subjects that have since become taboo. And in order to evaluate our relations, you concept like the American dream, we might just have to look in one of the most unexpected of places,

Speaker 2:          00:59          la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la.

Speaker 1:          01:06          Now you don't have to be an analytical genius to understand. And Harold and Kumar, it's about far more than the struggle to young potheads the perfect fast food

Speaker 2:          01:15          this night, the American dream.

Speaker 1:          01:19          So let's talk about the American dream for a second, generally defined as the ideals of freedom and equality for all American citizens, but maybe most importantly, it's the guarantee that within this landscape, every individual has the opportunity to achieve success in whatever it is they might pursue. On a surface level, it seems that the movie aligns itself, Isi Culture, as the story's about two members of minority groups trying to seeing the fruits of that concept that should be readily available to every American by default. However, we only have to examine the two main protagonists who discovered it. This observation is in fact false. Both Harold and Kumar seemed to embody the group in the stereotypical Asian American and Indian American. Harold is shown to be hardworking, anxiety, non provoking, and shy.

Speaker 1:          02:07          Waterfalls and studer group identity of the smart, well educated Indian American. With the talent for the medical professions, it quickly becomes clear ever. There's more to the east characters and just their stereotypes. I can't party tonight. Okay, I going to stay late at the office. Dude. Fuck that shit. We had friends I know, but I got a lot of work to do. When is getting high ever prevented you from doing your work held in whom are actually shown Zvi route or a stereotypical as they smoke weed, pursue sexual desires and make quads I racist jokes through their friends. You you'd use think about tits homes is there also seemed to be highly conscious of their struggle with their proposed group identity. Kumar has no interest in as far as the man that he becomes. A dark room is dirty and filled to the brim with posters or black rep artists and attempt to appropriate black culture in favor of his own federal, on other hand, still actively Ozon to a large part of his group and you showed you more hesitant and Kumar to break away from his character traits cleared at both harold and Kumar have a desire to be someone else to be their own versus at the beginning of the movie, both characters are essentially stuck in their struggle to find your own identities in relation to their proposed group.

Speaker 1:          03:21          They're both stereotypical as well as a stereotypical. No, no, no, no, no, no. I don't like breaking the law, makes very clear that is not doing a way with ethical stereotypes what is ratter and quite literally poking holes in them, in fact, poking holes into stereotypes but not doing away with them completely becomes one of the main themes of the movie. They have a Gelato, evangelicals, this multiethnic comedy, because a story allows the main characters to interact with people from a variety of ethnic groups. Instead of focusing on a group, the main characters themselves during these interactions, Harold and discovered that they choose are guilty of stereotyping potters because every person they need one of their quote unquote reality bubbles pop. First off, Harold was hesitant to spend time with the East Asian Club at Stanford as it seemed to embody to fool stereotypical group identity of Asian Americans, humanity, just to avoid having to go to party only to find out that there are parties are absolutely crazy.

Speaker 3:          04:25          Stick it hit you,

Speaker 1:          04:27          Tamara meats too. Posh British girls who want to meet up for a night of fun and it turned to prevent is harold and Kumar. Ended up in the girl's bathroom and find out just how class you'd these ladies are

Speaker 1:          04:41          later on if it was shown to be an overly stereotypical Jesus loving redneck Kumar clearly uncomfortable around him and so he tells them that are allowed to have sex with his wife. Lastly, when Harold ends up in police custody after having punched a police officer, he needs a black American man, but this time is different. Demand doesn't look like the stereotypical like plug. It seems to be quite the opposite. As he's reading a compilation of essays called civil disobedience. He explained to commodity has been arrested unfairly. Then ads that he doesn't get too worked up about it

Speaker 4:          05:18          in the end, universe tends done as it should have a really large penis that keeps me happy.

Speaker 1:          05:27          Not the first line is arguably the most important line of the entire movie, and I'll get back to that in a second, but the second line obviously reinforces a stereotype of black men and their son. David Jolanta explains this recurring theme and at the movie Los, every guy to identify themselves in relation to the stereotypes about your ethical group is not to say that all the minority characters in our Kumar, Sharon's been victims of his legacy. On the contrary, even the one person who can legitimately be seen as a victim refuses to see himself as such. In. Besides that, most of the auto minority characters don't seem to take their ethnical identities very seriously and even actively engaged in self ridiculed.

Speaker 2:          06:04          You know the Holocaust? Yeah, picture the exact opposite of that.

Speaker 1:          06:10          There still definitely an argument to be made how Harold and Kumar are being held back by external forces who seem to be predominantly white. It's no coincidence that the castle to the American dream is called white guests, but as we've seen how leukemia is not about complete generalizations and victimization, and this seems to be the last bubble to pop. We're two friends,

Speaker 1:          06:40          extreme sports bullies and racist cops are ultimately arrested by police officers. Even Neil Patrick Harris redeems himself by being for Hilton Kumar's food as they're stealing their car. So it seems to intellectual black guy was right, the universe, Dustin, to shoot in the end, how whom I reached their American dream, harold finally rebels against his own conformity with social conditioning as he stands up to his coworkers and ultimately gets the girl. Kumar, on the other hand, is now more accepted of his ability to potentially become a great surgeon and decides that it's time to let go of resisting the Spartan you make do with what you have. Seems to be the central message here. Yes, there will always be people who are living a little easier. Yes, there were always real assholes and bigots. There will always be individuals trying to hold you back, but it's up to you whether you let that affect you in whether you can allow yourself to not take everything so seriously. It's our own convictions and our perception of the world that can hold us back the most. That's why Harold and Kumar is about the American dream. It's about reevaluating yourself within the spectrum of group identity and individuality to them, proactively work your way towards that dream to let go of victim and to find the courage to teach or lead.

Speaker 2:          07:55          Oh, great.
