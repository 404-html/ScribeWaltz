Speaker 1:          00:02          The renowned writer and historian William do ran, one stated that quote, a great civilization is not conquered from without and so it has destroyed itself from within.

Speaker 1:          00:21          Now, those of you who've seen apocalypto may remember that the movie opens with this exact quote and it also really shooting come as much of a surprise that the mixture of Mel Gibson with a movie that attempts to prove Duran statement through to fictionalize decline of the Mayan civilization, was it the cause of some outbursts from numerous scholars? Stephen Ben's from the University of Nebraska writes that quote legally Gibson the madman. We'd give him too much of a pass. It will be to ignore us. Unfortunately, skilled participation in Hollywood cinema as long history as a tool for discrimination and oppression, but most importantly a large chunk of these critiques seem to culminate in a climax of the movie with the coming of the capital expanders and since the city mayans are depicted as rotten and cruel tracy and interprets this event as an offensive and racist notion that my people were brutal to one another long before the arrival of Europeans and us. They deserve that effect. They needed rescue. To be honest, I had a hard time trying to find a single academic article that wasn't an overly negative about this movie, so I figured it was about time for someone to change that and to do so, we need to start our analysis here.

Speaker 1:          01:33          It's a or Honda. Immediately introduce the audience to the first of the film's main themes and values, which is the hunter versus hunted relationship. Now, there is a reason why this is important, but I'll get back to that later. The second theme reveals itself as Jaeger par cuts of specific parts of the animal and gifts them to his fellow hunters. Shortly thereafter, they treat a part of the taper for some fish. God, by now to try passing by giving and sharing are shown to be integral parts of the community's culture. There existed conscious respect and gratitude for the abundance of the forest. We just show them both non verbally, not making use of literally every part of the team. Hello darkness, my old friend and verbally. My little later during the nighttime Fiesta village elder tells the story of the sad man who sat in the scrutiny, never be quelled, however much the world would give him.

Speaker 2:          02:24          Yeah know being at a new gate, take a book.

Speaker 1:          02:35          The theme of abundance has also extended your parents respect for fertility. Present in the community. Flint sky speaks of having produced 10 children. Do you ever pause his son? His wife is pregnant with her second and the kids run a muck in the village. Blunted seems to be the odd one out as he is unable to impregnate, his wife is due to dissatisfaction of her mother, the situation which Mel Gibson then of course utilize us to depict some 16th century pranking to register our next two themes, family, enjoy, or a piece with no real hierarchy or class system present. The community seems to function as a sort of big, happy family. In fact, the first act of buck lipstick could almost just as well be mistaken for a feel good comedy about jolly mind's kicking it into jungle.

Speaker 1:          03:31          However, if things aren't all Hunky Dory, as is evidenced in introduction of the first opposite thing, which is fear, Jaeger pause, brewery, Budda, encounter with the audit tripe, they seem scared and running away from something his father Flynn's skies subsequently explains to him that fear is a sickness. Unfortunately Jaguar pause, fear soon, become very real as the city minds approach the village and in contrast to the jelly looking hunter and gatherers, these mayans live grinman angry their leaders. Zero Wolf is seeing using human skulls as part of his warriors outfit as sound draws them near to the camp. He orders them to split up and sneakily make their way inside. It is here that it becomes obvious that these mines are on our hunts, but instead of tape here, fellow humans are to be their prey. Firas spread like wildfire throughout the villages. Zero volts crew capture, kill and rape their way for you to camp.

Speaker 1:          04:26          And as they make their way out, the surviving children are left behind. So at the beginning of the second act, the themes of family love and fertility are replaced by repressive authority and hateful moral indecency. And as soon made clear to violence and pain are the determining factors of strength in the community of the city, Mayan Warriors, the extend of the various contrasts between your protagonists world and the world of his captors becomes especially apparent. District group moves into dare part of the jungle, or rather what was one part of the jungle, the abundance fertility in all run feeling of lightness of the jungle village or a police by scarcity in fertility and death. One of the films most vital and powerful scenes as the encounter with the girl. The warriors have obviously given up any hope of helping dose contaminated, but what seems to be the plague as they pushed the desperate little girl away, she didn't seem to become possessed by some higher power, which then prophesizes the coming of the Spaniards and the end of the Mayan civilization.

Speaker 3:          05:27          Yes.

Speaker 1:          05:33          According to William Doran, the sign of a civilization is the client expresses itself and moral. The gay that's a group enters the city. It has shown that the sense of community and family has been replaced here by a lack of care for the weekend to old and slavery, theft, and of course the dehumanization of the human body depicted in the sacrifices to the gods. Again, fear and violent at 40 are shown to be the determining factors of the society. On of that, their leaders are conscious of this and the abuser through dare advantage to rule and some theater people as is evidenced by the preexisting knowledge of the coming solar eclipse, so it makes the scape the board has set and the stakes are clear besides being a personal struggle of life and death both for January as well as his trapped wife and son to chase metaphorically also signifies a struggle between the before mentioned opposite themes and values.

Speaker 1:          06:22          Love versus hey, abundance versus scarcity, freedom versus captivity, authority 40 versus family, the hunter versus hunted and of course courage versus fear, and it is exactly in this last aspect in which Jaeger par is lacking. After taking a leap of faith, he finally realized this and the science let go of his fear depicted in a scene in which he metaphorically embodies the symbolism of the Jaguar, which to some stands for the power to face one's fierce in front one's enemies. It's at that point it stops being the hunted and retakes, the role of the hunter thank wishing his adversaries, one by one users took a hell of a hit and most obvious sign of this change in roles of course has shown fruit to death with zero wolf by use of the TPO track.

Speaker 4:          07:18          Jennifer

Speaker 1:          07:20          fraud doesn't retake this role for a long as a chase ends on the beach and we're back at that controversial climax and we finally meet the ultimate hunters or to become the bringers of unspeakable amounts of death. Of course, as you might've noticed, I don't much agree on a degree of controversy. Apply to Apocalypto as a whole, as I believe that I've shown a story to me is not at all about justifying or sweet talking European colonialism in the Americas, but rather about more universal themes and real life cultural tendencies. Mel Gibson as you several aspects of the Mayan civilization to depict the sort of a historical summary of its people's rise and fall, you can even argue that the movie really isn't all that much about the Mayans at all as it Gibson himself as stated that he sees that Buck Lipo is more of an allegory for modern day America with many of the same struggles playing a role in today's society. I would go as far as stating that apocalypto stories even more universal than that and can be seen as a general visualization of William Durant's opening. Quote Duran, of course, was speaking of the fall of the Roman civilization, but Gibson being Gibson left some direct references to that sign within the story of Jaguar as well as another character or shown seven wounded in the right side of the abdomen. This combined with the fact that the group is being marched off to be sacrificed and mistakenly brings to memory one of Gibson's other protagonists

Speaker 1:          08:36          and right before this is all about to go down. Blumkin's mother in law has a brief Maria moment straight out of the passion of the Christ. So in the end, I believe there's far more substance to apocalypse, so dan just a chase scene and a quote unquote racist message. It's an action movie of Great Cinematography and one of the best chase sequences in Hollywood cinema's history most, but in its score, it remains deeply relevant story about a universal moral struggle in the cycle of rise and fall and hunter and hunted, and although the movie of course the pics, the apocalypse or the beginning of the end for the Mayan civilization, it also, and perhaps more importantly, leaves us with a message of hope to stick to our morals, to face the future and to have the courage to start it all over.

Speaker 1:          09:35          All right guys. That's the end of our analysis for apocalypto.
