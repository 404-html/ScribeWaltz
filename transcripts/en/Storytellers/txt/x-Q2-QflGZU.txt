Speaker 1:          00:00          A big thank you to squarespace for sponsoring this video.

Speaker 2:          00:04          It's not easy butchering people's hard work physically and mentally. I don't think people realize you need to vent.

Speaker 1:          00:12          One of the more fascinating aspects of David fincher's mind hunter is that it is not just a detective thriller. Dad Explores the psychology of serial killers but at it also explores why we are so fascinated by them, why we are drawn to the dark, why we are captivated, haunted and teased by the unthinkable. Although collecting serial killer memorabilia or writing them letters is a fringe activity. Serial killers in habits of prominence position within both our nonfictional and fictional popular culture, people are glued to coverage of real life serial killers such as Ted Bundy, Eileen wound, and Jeffrey Dahmer who all have their own documentaries and films.

Speaker 3:          00:53          I now present to you Jeffrey Dahmer in his command performance.

Speaker 1:          00:59          These real killers together with popular fictional depictions of serial killers such as Hannibal Lecter or dexter and John Doe demonstrate how eager the public is to learn more about him. The way in which mind center treats and thesises with accurate representations of real life. Serial killers was described by review as serial killer fence surface. Serial killers are this feud in our culture, both as despicable monsters,

Speaker 3:          01:25          monster, right? I think we can all agree

Speaker 1:          01:30          and fascinating cool celebrities.

Speaker 3:          01:33          You would really turn down the chance to meet Richard Speck is almost up there. They're advancing. Or maybe he'll give you an autograph,

Speaker 1:          01:41          but why is this? Why can't we get enough of them? The first episode of tend to suggest that there is a connection between the behavior of these killers and the broader state of culture and society,

Speaker 3:          01:54          democracy, Spanish style. What are just a response to turmoil? The government used to be symbolically a parental institution. It's a free for all. The world barely makes any sense. So it follows the crime doesn't either.

Speaker 1:          02:11          Is that what we see in serial killers? Are they an extreme representation of our broader society for which we are all responsible? Of course, holden and bill soon find out that serial killers are not crazy rampant aberrational parallels to the crazy chaotic culture of the sixties and seventies

Speaker 3:          02:30          that's that friends eat. I don't know what the hell is meticulous, highly intelligent.

Speaker 1:          02:38          The scholars can be intelligent and organized with very clear motivations for their quote unquote work such as sex, power and domination.

Speaker 2:          02:48          I'm just saying people who hunt other people for a vocation, all we want to talk about is what it's like

Speaker 1:          02:55          this. If serial killers are an extreme representation of human culture, they are so in the way. Historian Carsten Fisher describes, he argues that serial killers often developed in the same way as human civilizations, do civilizations in their fields, the unknown, half need to organize, control and dominate nature and other people. Therefore first domesticating and killing animals and so later in sloughing and it's killing all the humans. Just a serial killer, start with torturing and killing animals before they move on to people.

Speaker 3:          03:29          So then it became dogs and cats strangling them, burying them in the backyard. Hold on. Sorry.

Speaker 1:          03:37          On an individual level. This theory is also reflected by [inaudible] concept of the shadow self. You argue stairs. We repress primitive, negative socially or religiously depreciate as human emotions and impulses like sexual loss, power striving, selfishness, creeds and anger or rage into our own consciousness. Our dark side, so to speak, the shadow self is to counterpoint to what you called a persona, which is our conscious ego. How we see ourselves and represent ourselves to watch the worlds.

Speaker 3:          04:10          That's by Erving Goffman. He posits that life was like theater. We tailor ourselves to fit the parts that were playing in a social interaction. Awesome. Yeah. To put performance, there's an onstage area where individuals are actress as the case may be appear before the origins, but I must be backstage hidden private area where individuals can truly be themselves. Of course, emily,

Speaker 1:          04:33          I argued that it's mine. Tinter explosive notion that this is why we are fascinated by serial killers because we seen them extreme versions of personality traits that are part of us, but as we repress into our own consciousness that are part of our shadow selves, the series primary Dastis to the character of Holden Ford. In the early episodes we primarily see Holden's persona. He seems smart, that humble, idealistic with a real drive to do goods.

Speaker 3:          05:03          You sure you want me doing that? You're smart, you're idealistic, more than a little sensitive, they're going to love you.

Speaker 1:          05:12          However, he already mentioned Sitek that he will later use in his interviews with serial killers, try understanding him instead of trying to dominate,

Speaker 3:          05:22          look for common ground, find calming down.

Speaker 1:          05:26          Because of this very slowly over the course of the season, due to his extensive interactions with these killers, personality traits off his shadow self come forwards, traits such as envy and fucked up views of sex and women, which he claims is just an interview technique, but it seems fairly much connectors to the state of this relationship.

Speaker 3:          05:48          What gave you the right to take eight right consent of the world? Some of them looked pretty good. You would think you were depriving the rest of us

Speaker 1:          06:00          while also becoming more arrogant and power hungry.

Speaker 3:          06:04          You think, I don't know what you're doing with this principal's office bullshit. This is what I do with violent offenders. Only much better.

Speaker 1:          06:10          Two CDs in contrast in episode three he is celebrating a successful case like this. Thank you for acknowledging what my partner bill and I are doing and for embracing that. If we all work together,

Speaker 3:          06:25          we can venture into the blackest night and shine a light on the darkness.

Speaker 1:          06:29          Well, an episode 10 it is a different story.

Speaker 3:          06:35          I don't think I'm speaking at an attorney or when I say I.

Speaker 1:          06:41          However, I have heard some people suggest as holden in the next season might become a serial killer himself. I think this would be too easily a plot twist after such a slow and subtle transformation into a shadow self. More importantly, the concept of the shadow self doesn't mean we are all secretly murderous psychopath. Serial killers represent extreme versions of negative traits that normal people would possess in a much more minor capacity call. You argue stair to become once complete self. The shadow self needs to be recognized, acknowledged and accepted as Jordan Peterson argues this can be done to an intellectual exercise when you contemplate your own capacity for evil

Speaker 3:          07:24          and I don't think, and this is something I did learn from yoga is that you cannot be a good person until you know how much evil you contain within you. It is not possible and it's a very strange thing because you wouldn't think that the revelation of the capacity for evil is a precondition for the realization of good but I believe at first of all why would you be serious enough to even attempt to pursue the good unless you had some sense of what the consequence was of not doing it with you

Speaker 1:          07:52          guards to hold him. He doesn't seem aware of his own shadow self coming forwards until possibly the very ends of the season. In my opinion, it is unclear whilst holding force breakdown signifies two two s clash with Kemper. He might've become aware of its own shadow self coming forwards, becoming a more balanced person and the next season, who am I going to fuck him? Fuck police torture mutilation. This made you paranoid. It could also mean that he will spin fruit out of control. Is Shadow self taking over a while being unable to catch a new serial killer on the rice. My in Toronto. We will continue to explore this psychology of serial killers profiling some of the world's most famous ones, but it's me. Yeah. B It is simultaneously profiling us.

Speaker 3:          08:40          Well.
