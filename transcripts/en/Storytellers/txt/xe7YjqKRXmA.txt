Speaker 1:          00:05          It's been five years since black water originally aired and its explosion of wildfires, still a sight to behold, but besides it's visual appeal, it's in this moment through the death of hundreds in which the true nature of the various characters involved are laid bare. It's these reactions they have and the decisions they make in the face of death rather than the visual spectacle of war itself that makes this episode and game of thrones as a whole, as great as it is now, last season, we got to experience what it's like to see another battle play out in this time on a much higher budget, but the battle of the bastards is in a lot of ways the opposite of black water. The main focus here is on the visual rather than the moral and psychological. It's about the feeling of chaos for John and the horror of medieval warfare itself.

Speaker 1:          00:53          Now, don't get me wrong, it's a tremendous visual sequence that dwarfs every battle previously seen on a show or TV in general for that matter, but it's also sequenced. That's lacking in the aspects that make game of thrones unique. The Battle of the best verses a struggle between the forces of good and forces of evil, whereas blackwater is a fight between two sites, none of which are portrayed as being more benevolent or ill intention. Then the other nearby effectively confusing the audience and who to root for. It's in this fog of war at writer George Rr Martin has decided to depict the battle through the eyes of various individuals, individuals from both sides who are all dealing with the stress and the anxiety that comes with the reality of death and their own particular way. We can see it in devils, retaining his sense of level headed pragmatism and in the fanatical faith of his son we received in Tyrian resorting to one last night of lovemaking and accepting his fate.

Speaker 1:          01:46          As a military commander, we see it in prideful nihilism stenosis, content, demeanor, bronze drinking, the hound cynicism. It's a show of character in the face of death, a stripping away of all the superficialities that normally shout the true essence of who these people truly are. Don't get killed. No, you my friend. Oh, are we friends now? Of course we are, or as we'll showed her, puts it well. It was expanding on the thoughts of William Faulkner, the only thing or if writing about is the human heart in conflict with itself. We all have it in us to be angels and all of those have it in us to be monsters. What matters is the decisions we make at two crucial periods and times of our life and it's during the times when death, disability stone's throw away, that our most authentic self will consciously or unconsciously come to light by placing the emphasis on the decisions and the mortality of individuals in battle.

Speaker 1:          02:43          Rather than framing this story in a more conventional and simplistic good versus bad struggle. It provides the audience for our very own conflict of heart as we're now invited to seed our world in a more nuance and a more human manner, no longer rooting for sides, for instead rooting for the individual, empathizing with them, or at the very least, truly learning something about their nature. For King Joffrey, this means is show of cowardice or perhaps also evidence of is harmful upbringing by a cynical mutter who ultimately shows herself to be akin to the prideful destructiveness of real life, mocked a goebbels, but on the other hand we also get a sense of why it is that she became a hateful person. She shows herself to be she drunkenly, spouts out her resentments towards her father and her role as a woman in the family. It was expected of me as it will be a view if you ever become joffrey's queen, but in the midst of all the bickering between main characters in the midst of our self reflection leadership and the terminus in the face of the feet, George Rr Martin also doesn't forget to show us the humanity on a larger skill and how the decisions of our high born characters affect the lives of thousands otherwise, nameless and forgotten people.

Speaker 2:          03:54          The lab's called agreement to make, trying to sneak away with a stolen horse and some gold cups.

Speaker 1:          04:01          How's the NNC to them? It's through these brief glimpses in the background through shots of commoners fleeing soldiers, vomiting before battle in a sense that the good and the righteous only stands to lose in this war of kings. Boys will never come back. Feel free will the west. It's about showing this that Martin personalizes and the generalized, the conflict to the very bottom of the game of thrones hierarchy. Throughout the episode, Tyrian is the one character who truly grasps the wider humanity at play, who understands the gap between the ones of the high born and wants of those staking their order

Speaker 2:          04:38          for your kids. Don't fight for his kingdom. Your means the fact that your Katie's.

Speaker 1:          04:46          It's only fitting that Syrian has been known to be Martins, own embodiment of who he'd be or who he wants to be in the world of game of chromes and it's complete deconstruction of the US versus them narrative. Blackwater shows itself to be highly critical of the feudal succession system and the senselessness of the conflict being driven by people who send her again, describes as,

Speaker 2:          05:05          this is a killer. Atlanta's just kill us, kill us.

Speaker 1:          05:12          It's in this pessimistic, yet realistic view of the world of game, of thrones and fruit, a depiction of a truly great conflict in which good and bad exist on both sides and inside the individual characters themselves, but the futility of it all becomes everclear and in which game of thrones uniqueness truly shines as George himself puts it in response to the battles likeness to deloitte or rings battle of Helm's deep. The ward at Tolkien wrote about was war for the fate of civilization and the future of humanity, and that's become the template. I'm not sure that's a good template though. It's all key model lead generations of fantasy writers to produce these endless series of dark Lord Cinder Evil Minions who were all very ugly and wear black clothes, but the vast majority of wars throughout history are not like that. Although structurally very similar its core, a black water can really be seen as a sort of anti helm's deep and whereas the battle of the bastards might be a different type of battle in its essence, it has a lot more in common with helm's deep and it's all keen template in general being an outlier and for some maybe a breath of fresh air.

Speaker 1:          06:13          There's really nothing wrong with this in itself, but it seems that the final two seasons of the show, we'll perhaps somewhat unavoidably move ever more into the direction of conventional talking fantasy. But before we get there though, there are still battles to be fought which could and shoot. Bring out what makes game of thrones great in the first place. If visually compelling, morally gray battle that exposes true character in the face of death, the question remains, however, how to show will choose to deal with their very own conflict of heart and to what extent it has already decided on a more conventional and perhaps safer path in the end. Will door to salvation for our characters opened at the very last moment or will it remain closed and will the story dare to show itself to be to entitle key truly is

Speaker 1:          07:07          and who. All right, that's the end of yet another video essay. Black water has to be one of my favorite game of thrones episodes and I hope this video gave you his sentence. Why as I'm recording this, it's only a couple of hours until the release of season seven's first episode. Which direction do you guys think the show will take and how do you think it will all end next year? I would love to hear your thoughts on this anyway.
