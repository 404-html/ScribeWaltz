Speaker 1:          00:04          I told you and have it applied.

Speaker 2:          00:06          Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:08          I think the first time I watched rick reunite with Ilsa was during one of my film classes in College Larson. I have watched a great many old films during those lectures. Most of which I think both of us don't really remember that well is we had the tendency to doze off and those comfortable sit in my seats. That was until Cassa blank. I came around and managed to firmly break that cycle of it's quick witted dialogue and sambal memorable characters and of course it's music.

Speaker 2:          00:40          Ooh,

Speaker 1:          00:42          the most of all is the film's overall story that makes her such an enjoyable viewing experience and it was only after I'd read Robert McKee aptly named book story that I fully came to understand why kiss a blank. I can be seen as a sort of gold standard for great storytelling. Soon this video, I'd like to deviate from our usual format and provide you a more practical look into the realm of storytelling as a whole. To do this. I'll guide you through and Mickey's guidelines for scene analysis and we'll take an in depth look and one of gas blankets. Most pivotal scenes. It's not a scene that I, once you analyze its guests of Blanco's midair climax, which is being set up right here as rick spots. It'll saw walking around to market, but before we get into that, we first need to answer the following question.

Speaker 1:          01:33          What makes a scene work? Some might say it, it's good dialogue or nice visuals and although these things definitely help when key notes to the determining factor lies within the subjects. Then the underlying structure of the scene. Now what does this mean within scenes, we can make the distinction between texts, sensory service off the image or an auto words. Everything that we see and here on screen and subutex, which are all defaults, feelings and conscious as well as unconscious desires. If the characters on screen and not a words, everything that is unseen or actively being veiled behind the sensory surfers of the text. If characters lack multiple layers, they tend to feel bland, which causes them to feel fake and dialogue to suffer as a consequence which take a look at the segment from bill harbor.

Speaker 2:          02:30          It's your nose.

Speaker 1:          02:35          What has happened here is that the subtext has been written directly into the text, which is commonly known as writing on the nose. Good films, on the other hand, generally have derek characters express themselves through subtext seems move because conscious and unconscious desires clash. That's writers continuously up the stakes and with dark characters on the spot because they know it's the decisions they make, the actions they take that tell us more about a character then any piece of surface level dialogue ever could just try them too. You

Speaker 3:          03:06          not so fast, lilly, nobody is going to be arrested, not for a while yet.

Speaker 1:          03:11          Now that we've covered that, let's go back to the mid at climax and analyze how it gets a blank. I use subutex to move to seeing forward. The first two things that we want to do is one defined a conflict at the scene and to note the opening value. To do this. We will need to briefly cover the context of the scene. So for those of you are already very familiar with the movie, you feel free to skip ahead. Rick Blaine is a former freedom fighter turned saloon owner and castle blank, or during the Second World War as cynical nature's revealed early on to be caused by a devastating heartbreak he experienced the year earlier in Paris, his goal friend and soon to be wife Ilsa Lund abandoned him. Today you were supposed to escape the city from the Nazis together. Fast forward a year and a to run into each other by coincidence and rick's bar, it'll sound, however, is not come alone. And during the late nine meetup, rick drunkenly, he calls her out for being a horror as she attempts to explain herself.

Speaker 3:          04:01          Tell me, what did you left me? Lazlo are there others in between? Aren't you the kind of tell

Speaker 1:          04:11          after which you angrily barges out, which takes us back to the market scene. So did define the conflict. We need to note the desires of the main characters and play. Rick initiated the Seton and despite his inner resentment, has goal is clear to when sub back her motivations on the other hand aren't clear yet, but they're encounter tonight before plus her guarded attitude right now give away to, she has an active interest in keeping her affair with rick in the past. The opening value of the scene is love else's relationship to victor. Laszlo has not been made clear yet, so rick sees an opportunity to reunite with his former lover. The value is there for a positive, which brings us to the first step. Breaking the scene and two beats. Now beat is an exchange of action reaction in character behavior both on a textual as well and more importantly on a subtextual level. So let's see if we can mark all the beats in this scene.

Speaker 3:          04:59          You will not find a trade like this in only 700 francs.

Speaker 1:          05:04          The first one is established right here before either rick or hills. I have even uttered a single word. Rick's action is to approach her. It was a, on the other hand, sensing his presence, chooses to ignore him,

Speaker 3:          05:15          cheated

Speaker 1:          05:17          rick opens by protecting her from the salesman and are now acknowledges his existence but chooses to reject his advances. Rick's Voris who, whoever seem to hint that more heals us relationship with Laszlo.

Speaker 3:          05:28          Hi there ladies kinds of weeks. We have a small discount. Did I say 700 francs? You can have a 200 I'm sorry I was in no condition to receive you when you called on me last night. It doesn't matter. No, no special friends Albany cause we have a special discount of 100 flags.

Speaker 1:          05:43          Brick now tries to hide his embarrassment by using excessive for melody to apologize for his behavior, but it also remains unimpressed.

Speaker 3:          05:50          The story had me a little confused. Maybe it was a boy bourbon. I have some table called some neck pain. I'm really not. Please one minute please.

Speaker 1:          05:58          Still attempting to open up the conversation he moves to excuse making, but yet again hills or we'll have none of it yet. She doesn't choose to leave. Also notice how the role of the salesman is not really at all about comically selling his lace to Ilsa, but rather about selling rick to Elsa.

Speaker 3:          06:14          Why did you come back to tell me why you ran out on me at the railway station? Yes.

Speaker 1:          06:19          Rick desperately tries to get his foot in the door by asking her a question that provides his own answer and it works. It was, that opens up just a tiny bit.

Speaker 3:          06:27          I do. You can tell me now. I'm reasonably showgirls. I don't think I will rick

Speaker 1:          06:31          by insulting them. Rick is at this point, essentially begging tools are in his own way where she's no longer rejecting him completely, but opposing him and asking for more.

Speaker 3:          06:40          Why not? After all that got stuck with the railway ticket, I think I'm entitled to know last night I saw what has happened to you, the rain can you in Paris? I could tell him he don't understand at the one who looked at me with such hatred,

Speaker 1:          06:53          rick losing his patient slightly moves to guilt tripping ill zones to be an explanation. But both parties feel like dare to victims. So it'll say guilt trips, rick right back.

Speaker 3:          07:04          How believing Casablanca soon and we'll never see each other again. We knew very little about each other when we were in love in Paris. We'll leave it that way. Maybe we'll remember those days. Not Casablanca, not last night.

Speaker 1:          07:19          Ilsa now takes over to the initiative by trying to see her goodbye to rick, who then completely refuses to react and instead starts to next beat.

Speaker 3:          07:26          Did you run out me because you couldn't take it because you knew what it would be like hiding from the police running away all the time. It can believe that if you want to.

Speaker 1:          07:34          So now he decides to hit her with his best guests for an extra nation by calling her a coward. Those are no cysts to be false. So she insults him, ride back by basically calling him a fool.

Speaker 3:          07:44          Well, I'm not running away anymore. I'm settled now above us alone. That's true. But the walk up a flight, I'll be expecting you.

Speaker 1:          07:54          The spider continuous denials, rick sends us her true feelings in sexually propositions for two facts and she tries to hide her blush on her hat brim. Rick now feels like she's almost within his reach,

Speaker 3:          08:05          all the same. Someday you'll lie the Laszlo, you'll be there. No, no. You say Victor Laszlo is my husband and was even when I knew you in Paris.

Speaker 1:          08:20          But again, rick can contain his pain and calls her out for being a whore. It was a haven't been called a slut for the second time. Reaches for the one thing she knows who will hit the hardest because the revelation that she'd always been married to Laszlo would imply that she just used rick for her own pleasure in Paris and that our love had never been real all along. However, the subtext of the scene gives away to quite the opposite is the truth. But of course rick doesn't know that yet and was left devastated as Ilsa walks off. So at the end of the scene to hopeful positive opening value has changed into a deep and dark negative. And the final step of our analysis, we can see how to writers of guests a blank and I've built a rapid progression of beets, each placing in governing value of love at greater risk, the 11 beat marks to climax and turning point of the scene after which the opening value changes to its closing value.

Speaker 1:          09:08          Of course the scene is, but a minor part in the massive full piece of writing that is Casablanca has basically every scene in a movie as great if not greater than the one we just analyze. But it goes to show how much attention to scene structure and subutex has gone into the film. And by having explored that, I hope to shed a light minor as it may be on a craft of screenwriting as a whole. Because even though your scripts like Casablanca mine of a surface level story, that's as Corny as they come. If the writing is good and if the emotions are real and if the scenes aren't what they seem to be about, you might just have something special in your hands

Speaker 2:          09:45          looking at you kid.

Speaker 1:          09:55          All right guys, thanks for watching. So obviously this video is quite different from what we usually do and it's something that I've been wanting to make since we first started the channel. I just felt like it didn't really have the editing capabilities to pull off just yet, so it tells if you'd like. These types of our practical slash informative video is in between her regular analysis and we'll be sure to make more of them. Also if you like what we do and one more check at our patrion page where we produce additional content and followers on social media and all that good stuff. Also, one more thing if my voice sounds a little off in this one towards the end it's because I got a little sick during the production of this video, have recently moved halfway across the globe, so that probably has something to do with it. Anyways, I think that wraps things up. Thanks again for watching and see you all the next one.
