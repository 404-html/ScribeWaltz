Speaker 1:          00:25          I think that the story of Simba is an a typical and mythological story, not only about the hero's journey, but more importantly about the meaning of growing up. When Tim was born in the opening of the film, he is held up to look out over off Africa's wildlife who bow down before him, freedom him with all respect and obedience. From a Freudian perspective, this is a wonderful allegory for Freud's concept of his majesty, the baby. When a child is born, the first stage of his life is one of infantile omnipotence, vr. At first it needs of knowing we are special and the central focus of our parents care and concern. At this point, we cannot see beyond our own needs in the lion king, Simba is not only the center of his parents, universe birth, he is bound down before by the whole assembled African wildlife.

Speaker 2:          01:15          Everything that like touches is our kingdom. A King's time is ruler rises and falls like the sun. One day Simba, the Sun will set on my time here and will rise with you as the new king. Everything

Speaker 1:          01:39          this, however it creates a problem. Thanks to his father's rule. The pride lands are imbalance. Simba is this born in paradise and in his infant they'll nip Athens. He is the center of it. Therefore, there's nothing to prove himself, nothing to conquer. Hence his fascination with the elephants grief yards. Here, he can defy parental authority and show his bravery birth where his father's bravery is a mature connection with the danger and the possibility of death. Simba in his infantile omnipotence has no real connection to these things. A suit characterize argues in the Journal of child psychotherapy. Adolescent risk taking is so often off this nature. It's a dare send out into the world to show that we are immune to vulnerability without any real emotional connection to the dangerous. We pretend to disdain

Speaker 2:          02:27          being brave. It doesn't mean you go looking for trouble. You're not scared of anything I was today. Yes, I thought I might lose you.

Speaker 1:          02:41          Of course this cannot last and to reality of danger and death is trusted in December's life in a haunting way when Mufasa dies while trying to save Simba due to a plot by my father's brother's car is from a rational perspective, rather unclear why Simba feel so guilty about his father's death. He listened to scar wader. It's where it was still so wait for his father and he didn't cost the stampede. So one argument is that felt unworthy of being saved and worthy of his father's sacrifice. Well, Fossa seems to rue flawlessly. He is a constant reminder of what Simba is not brave, strong and wise after symbols, filter tend to prove himself worthy in the elephants' graveyard it's facing now. He knows his arrogance and infantile omnipotence fades away and he feels unworthy both of his father, his sacrifice and his destiny off being king, so he runs run away. Another key argument for skills is Freudian oedipal teary, where fruit argues to wish of songs to replace and take the positions of the father's dad. You shouldn't. In the beginning of the film. Timber in this arrogance, Singh's office wished to become king. This of course implies determining his father or his father dying as was also realized by on the strader's when the parody to song

Speaker 3:          04:06          hello. Hi.

Speaker 1:          04:12          Simba is either consciously or unconsciously aware of his wish to replace his father, which feeds his feelings of guilt for his father's death. Therefore, in an attempt to escape his guilt, he runs away from his father's position as king. He this rinse away, but it's not only from the private lands and it's right for places king, but also from all the personality traits his father embodied.

Speaker 3:          04:34          Yeah, got to put your past behind. You look at bad things happen and you can't do anything about it. Right, right, wrong. When the world turns its back on you, you turn your back on Delaware.

Speaker 1:          04:47          It is here that Simba anthers and adolescent phase where he chooses escapism in pleasure, discarding any responsibility he joins a gang or fourth categorized describes as a sexual dropouts where the prevailing wisdom is not to worry about any consequences of one's actions.

Speaker 3:          05:09          Dan, a problem three

Speaker 1:          05:19          this way. Similar defense himself from his guilt by cutting himself off from the past and immersing himself in living in the moment. It's quite telling that in this sequence Simba turns to eating bugs and just having his Neil's faults by [inaudible] where Simba first envied his father strength, power and aggression and tried to emulate those traits, no fuels, these traits and his rivalry with his father were responsible for his father's death. Therefore he relinquishes his competitiveness, healthy aggression and ambition in fear that he cannot control these traits and we'll become destructive. Simba at this point is not aware that giving up these traits has a cost as well and that it is not the solution. If we give up our ambition, competitiveness and aggression for escape pleasure, we cannot develop ourselves fully and take our place in the world in an escapist position, we will remain self centered and enabled to help those around us. Eventually both our own lives and our surroundings, we all start falling apart as Jordan Peterson states. You know, we have this strange idea that's especially again foisted on young men that the pathway to virtue is through weakness and harmlessness and that's just simply not true that that that's the pathway to uselessness and resentment. Cimbar realizes this when Nala confronts him to, to symbolic, opting out of responsibility, the pride lands have fallen into ruin and all animals are suffering.

Speaker 3:          06:47          Look, sometimes bad things happens and there's nothing you can do about it. So why worry? Because it's your responsibility.

Speaker 1:          06:56          Tim Bias to tear himself away from the escapists pleasures off his Hakuna Matata philosophy in order to take a mature place in a world where he can be responsible for himself and others to do this. However, he must complete a difficult task or facing himself and his guilt of his father's death.

Speaker 3:          07:15          You said you'd always be there for me.

Speaker 4:          07:19          That's true or not.

Speaker 1:          07:23          It's because of me.

Speaker 4:          07:26          It's my fault.

Speaker 3:          07:28          It's life

Speaker 1:          07:31          as client stays. The oedipal struggle is to relinquish one's wish to take the fall dish replace, but instead of taking one's own place in the world while still adopting was good in a father too. Happy to be both like him and different than him instead of needing to be in in the lion king. This is symbolized beautifully by visualizing symbols, internal struggle through him finding his rate through tick tones and then seeing himself and his father in his reflection in the water

Speaker 2:          08:01          you see he needs.

Speaker 1:          08:09          I think this is the key moment of Simba story, the painful journey or facing himself and his guilt about his father is what enables Simba to transcend this adolescence and become a man or in this case lion in his own rights. Simba understands that he is not as far though that he can find his father within him only by internalizing Mufasa and the qualities here, narratives from him, Simba can adopt responsibility for others and face scar in order to restore the pride lands to balance. And the end to center architect Malesan lesson off the lion king is that in order to grow up we must adopt responsibility of ourselves and others. If we choose to escape its pleasures and renounce our healthy aggression, our competitiveness and ambition, we've become unable to engage productively in the world. To remember that who we are is to remember where we can be. It is to adopt the responsibility or realizing our full potential and to try to make our world a better place. All right.
