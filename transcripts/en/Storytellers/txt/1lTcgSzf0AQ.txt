Speaker 1:          00:00          Yeah,

Speaker 2:          00:03          awhile ago I stumbled upon this poem by Charles Bukowski on what it takes to be a writer.

Speaker 3:          00:10          If it doesn't come bursting out of you in spite of everything, don't do it as it comes out of your heart and your mind and your mouth and your gut. Don't do it. If you have to sit up for hours staring at your computer screen or hunched over your typewriter, searching the words, don't do it. If it's hard work, just thinking about doing it. Don't do it unless it comes out of your soul like a rugged, unless being still would drive you to madness or suicide or murder known. Do it when it is truly time. If you have been chosen, it will do it. I itself and then it will keep on doing it until you die or it dies in you. There is no other way and never was.

Speaker 2:          01:08          His message of course extends to other creative professions from directing to composing music to painting or even sports and although I think it's a beautiful poem and quite a romantic way of looking at creative endeavors. He's also horribly and sentimentally wrong. History is filled with creative geniuses were it didn't just came bursting out of them. Take some of our current superintendent riders, for example, from Aaron Sorkin who describes having a perpetual writer's block to George r Martin, who can't seem to finish his new book to Terentino's, who has spoken about how difficult it is to be staring at an empty piece of paper where somehow his new movie needs Sapir and finally Robert Mckee, writer of the Bible and screenwriting, who claims he is the biggest procrastinator in the world.

Speaker 2:          02:06          I think for these creative minds, birth asa for you, me and many others, the more excited you are about your creative endeavor, the bigger the project, and to more important to fulfilling your dreams, the harder it is to actually sit down and do it. The trap that many writers, including myself, fall into mainly consists of staring motionless at a blank page. It's not that we don't want to write or that we don't have the ability to put words down on the page. We just don't have any good ideas. It's not a fun place to be. Believe me, Steven Pressfield states there was a secret that real writers know that want to be writer, stones it. It's not the writing part that's hard. What's hard is sitting down to write and he calls this force that keeps us from sitting down. Resistance.

Speaker 2:          02:55          Resistance according to Pressfield, is what stands the life we live and are in lifts. Life stands between us enter dreams or for we want to become and what we want to create. Are you a writer that doesn't write? A painter, doesn't paint an entrepreneur that never starts adventure, then you have fallen victim to resistance. Resistance is to be taken seriously, says pressfield's. It has to be declared evil. Millions have been defeated by it. Dreams of diets because one gave up or never dare to starts. It is therefore essential to learn to recognize resistance and learn how to beat it. Pressfield gives a beautiful description of resistance. He states that resistance is invisible and internal. We might think that it is friends, jobs, bets, or the Internet that keeps us from our creative work. Birth that's false.

Speaker 4:          03:50          Hungry. I should get coffee. Coffee would help me think pressure, right, something purse, then reward myself with coffee, coffee, and a muffin. Okay, so I need to establish the scenes maybe been not good enough.

Speaker 2:          04:10          The force of resistance, stent thrombosis to engage with these things and procrastinates comes from ourselves. Resistance is to self generate enemy from within. Resistance is most commonly expressed in procrastination because it is the easiest to rationalize our starts bit. I'll start tomorrow.

Speaker 5:          04:32          There was one week when you wore sweatpants.

Speaker 2:          04:44          Of course. Resistant school is to have a seeing this until our deathbeds. Other manifestations of resistance can be indulging in alcohol, sex Mr Batian, TV, gossip and eating fat, sugar, salt and chocolate. Prestfield describes that indulging is not always a manifestation of resistance, but if fuel, hello and unfulfilled afterwards, it's probably was. We subconsciously know that we gave up our longterm goal for instant gratification. Resistance Speedos?

Speaker 4:          05:18          Yeah. Out there. Sticking your Dick in anything that moves. I'm trying to get back at me, which is fine. Do you know what the worst thing is? You're not writing. You have this gift. You have this incredible talent and you're just flushing it down. The toilet resistance

Speaker 2:          05:36          expresses itself when you create drama in your life, claim victim hood when you spent your time criticizing others, when you turn your life into a soap or when you rationalize a way while you haven't started yet as a working artist doesn't accept this kind of self destructive behavior in his life because it prevents him from his work. Yet resistance can be helpful. Resistance points us to our true calling. It's can be felt when we fear starting a creative project. Does fear mean stead? It is something that we need to do something we have a deep love for. If she didn't love project, that's terrifying you. You wouldn't feel anything at all.

Speaker 4:          06:20          You want to step on the wire. I don't know if I'll be able to take to do.

Speaker 2:          06:26          The more resistance you feel towards the project, the more fulfilled you will be when you finish it. Resistance always points us to our true north, so how do we consistently beat resistance as Steven Pressfield, ses by turning pro as he describes tuning pro, it has nothing to do with making or nuts making money out of your creative work. It isn't perfect. If philosophy of work in ideology of ethics on how you conduct your creative projects, you can turn professional one day and being immature again. The next

Speaker 4:          07:02          in short, I was back. Yes, yes, there is something I want to ask you. How the fuck do you write? So many books so fast I think. Oh, I've had a really good six months. I've written three chapters that you've got three books in that time.

Speaker 6:          07:28          The way that. The way that I work, I try to get out there and I try to get six pages a day, so with a book like end of watch and I work when I'm working, I work every day, three, four hours and I try to get those six pages and I try to get them fairly clean and you do hit six pages a day. I usually do.

Speaker 2:          07:49          Now death is an example of a pro as pressfield states to professional knows that the mundane physical act of sitting down and starting to work sets in motion, a mysterious process that produces inspiration. The immature waits for inspiration. The professional knows that it will come off to you. Starts now, as you see, turning pro has little to do with talens. George Rr Martin is one of the most gifted authors of generation bits. He hasn't turned pro, which is why I am still waiting for a next book. The professional therefore x in the face of fear when the amateur fierce, a big creative endeavor. He waits for the fear to disappear. The professional knows this will never happen and starts anyway, and immature dreams of stardom and glory. The professional has no use for this. He knows that success is merely a byproduct of work. He does the work and let's do rewards come or not come as they may. By doing this pro four, it's disappointment and Nia offer assistance that it will use to make us give up.

Speaker 4:          08:56          Are you now or have you ever been a member of the Communist Party? May I introduce to evidence you are out of order my work? No, no, no, no, no, no. I will. No. I'm making this determination. The chair will rule critical just a minute. Your screenplays for too long. I've heard that before. The professional

Speaker 2:          09:16          also place it as it lays. He doesn't find excuses in bed. Luck at food, city or injustice needed us. He led a windfall or good luck for him into thinking he is there already.

Speaker 4:          09:28          I'll write you a movie for $1,200 and you don't want your name on it.

Speaker 2:          09:32          No, you don't want my name. He accepts the situation as it is the pro marching song. No matter what the professional, let's go his ego. He doesn't take failure or success personally. Fear of rejection is human and lies deep in everyone. Resistance, no stis and uses it to paralyze us and prevent us from doing our work. Prestfield states that this is one of the hardest aspects of turning pro. The professional puts his heart and soul into his work. Then he steps back and assesses the. It's hardly at courtly. He takes notes where he can do better. His next project, and then he moves on the professional. This accepts criticism, but it's never takes it personally. He knows resistance will use rejection to break him. Therefore, the professional and jurors adversity when he's faced down in arena chewing on sand and everyone's laughing at him, he knows it is still better to be in the arena than standing on the sideline. Lastly, where the amateur might make romantic claims about doing it for the love about not caring or being even proud of not making money. The professional recognizes that too much love, we'll freeze him. Playing for money is to device he uses to adopt a working men modality. As pressfield states the muse of inspiration, loss of blue collar work ethic. She lost a working stiff and hates prima donnas. The pro takes money to turn his life into his job, technically place bay, but in the end he does it for the love of the game.

Speaker 2:          11:11          At this point, you might be thinking, well, the cold and heartless way to look at creative work. Where's the romance? Where stem mythology to beauty and mystery of ours. These are things that we aim for when we turn pro because we know when we beat resistance and sit down to do our work, something magical happens when we sit down and grind it out. Inspiration strikes, it starts to flow effortlessly. Color the flow states call it being in the zone or espresso fueled does call it abuse where resistance recites and hell creation has a seat in heaven. Here the Mucus looks down and my issue grades your professionalism. When you present yourself to her with an attitude of legalist, snus and surface, she will come down and sit on your shoulder, a powerful ally to help you in your endeavor. When we beat resistance and starts, the Muse will guide us battling the dark force of resistance beside us till we finish our project.

Speaker 2:          12:14          It is only at this moment when you type that last word, when you played that last note, when you danced, that last step that you can look resistance in the eye and say, rest in peace motherfucker. After which she will start a new project and the battle starts a new thanks for watching everyone in the day or two.
