Speaker 1:          00:02          So after having recently watched Black Mirror, it struck me at the shows. Most genuinely unsettling episodes don't just blatantly show a highly negative dystopian future. Instead they take us for a ride and reflect to us a vision of the future. Highly compatible with our own current desires, the desires you capture, share and hold onto the past. Because the way in the entire history of you, this desire to hold onto our memories has manifested itself in the grain. A device connected to our signups is that records everything your eyes see. You can replay your recordings or your reduce esther called at any given time, showed them to your friends and family or hand them over to to forties when everyday. So require you to, if you just really wanted me, I lost 24 hours. The story makes it abundantly clear that the widespread integration of the grain in society has enormous implications for the privacy of its characters.

Speaker 1:          00:56          That's the room that many respects that's lost nearly all of its meaning in a since been replaced rather by his sentiment that can roughly be described us. Nothing to hide, nothing to fear. We can see the implementation of this mindset right here and the airport scene. The big thing, just how or rally and the government has become in favor of its own security, but we also see it manifested in the workplace as Liam's law firm demands access to their employees, reduce in order to ensure their productivity, loyalty, and security for the image of the company. And although the implementation of the grain has not been made mandatory, it's been highly normalized to the degree that grainless before stigmatized as having something to hide and being degenerate, which is in turn supported by the fact that police won't respond to calls for help from grainless citizens and why it's is promoted as being cheaper than a cup of coffee.

Speaker 1:          01:46          It's a power structure that at first glance seems to benefit the forces in positions of power. Calling back to Jeremy Bentham, Scott set with the Panopticon, which is a version of a rounded prison with a tower in the center in which a guard could watch every individual prisoner at any time, but the prisoners and dare turn could not see to guard and therefore would never know whether they were being watched or not. So if you're radically creating self disciplinary prisoners now to use this concept as a metaphor in relation to our own society is as clear as day in frankly somewhat on the nose. The big thing, the dangers of unlimited surveillance and personal data mining and the lack of balance between the watcher and watched the entire history of you, however, shows in near future in which everyone now effectively has inherited both those roles acting bove as a living, breathing, CCTV camera, your bitch.

Speaker 1:          02:32          I'd like you to erase that as well as the object passing through its frame. Not gonna hit anything to freak us out. How that they're not, there's no major deletions this quarter. No, no, no. Everything's a well within prophetess. However, it would be a mistake to conclude that the green is merely a product of some level in police state as it seems to be more of a natural outcome of years upon years of increasingly sharing our personal lives from taking selfies to the recording of concerts to lifestreaming your life for the entire world. To see there never was a need to make grain mandatory because who wouldn't want to share and relive the good old times during a nice reunion dinner. And this is read the entire history of you shines the most by refraining from focusing on the more obvious and already broadly covered bigger picture and instead minimizing its aim onto what interests us most, the personal and the coziness of a warm lead lid living room it relatable scene showing nuance and it's social commentary making us comfortable before ultimately showing its true ugly face during this painfully horrific scene at both the state of Lehman fees, marriage becomes obvious as well as the way in which degree in synthetically he keeps both of them stuck in the past, completely disconnected from their present selves.

Speaker 1:          03:48          Liam chosen to be the main focus of the story functions as a prime example of this obsession. We seed in his role as a litigation lawyer dealing solely with redo cases, but it's also noticeable in a slight but consistent social awkwardness seemingly never being really present to the moment using reduced to remember the name of one of his wife's best friends because who needs an actual memory when you have to grain. But where it's most evident is in is mistrust of his wife's faithfulness. Starting from the moment he sees her chatting with Jonas, he rapidly descends into a full blown paranoia, effectively prosecuting his wife using evidence from years ago. So when week or a month as lean tries to drink away and perhaps indulge into pain, has investigation is causing him. We noticed that this might very well be his share behavior seen in friends, family, and even the work environment.

Speaker 1:          04:39          And it's really no wonder that the indulgence of these mind numbing substances plays such a prevalent role in the society as various mirror shots indicate how the grain has caused part of Liam's personality to split, to stay behind, and they has been time, but it has been timed that can never be automatically let go off and it has the potential to come crashing down on you if you're not paying attention. Liam, in the end forces his wife to expose him to the truth. And the most visceral way imaginable is marriage now in ruins. He ponders about better times rewinding them and perhaps wishing he had really lift those moments when they were still real. And even though he turned out to be right in this obsessive paranoia, seeing how Lehman fear almost always shown apart from each other, one can only wonder what it was this brokenness to over analyze, to live in the past rather than in the present. That caused a rift in our marriage long before the event's shown on screen. So obsessed. I'm not, in the end, Leah knows that having a grain will never allow him to move on, that it would always keep him a prisoner of his own mind and it's at that point and he realizes that the only way he will ever escape this vicious cycle is to literally cut off that that would have the past. And
