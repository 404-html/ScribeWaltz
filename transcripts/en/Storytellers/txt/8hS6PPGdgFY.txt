Speaker 1:          00:01          And she's carrying something. It's not uncommon for a film to reveal its main theme and the opening scene of its story and Esu. Grab the audience's attention and give them a taste of what's to come, not unlike to ferry essay that I'm reading to you right now or really any other medium to tries to effectively convey a message. American sniper, as you can see here is no exception to this navy seal. Chris Kyle is laying on a rooftop in war torn Fallujah. His rifle aimed at a mother and her son away for Clint Eastwood to point us to his films, main theme family or rather the tragic destruction of family through war. However, it seems that this message didn't really get you on to a number of high profile audiences. Most notable or tweets from the likes of Seth Rogan, who compared to films who to throw Nazi propaganda movie shown and the third act of inglorious bastards.

Speaker 1:          00:50          Then there is Michael Moore staying at all snipers are cowards. No on Chomsky weighing in on what he states is a testament of support of everything that's wrong with American foreign policy. Documentary director Robert Greenwald, doing roughly the same thing on MSNBC and finally former presidential candidate Howard Dean speaking his mind on real time with Bill Maher. I bet you if you looked at a cross section of the tea party and people would go to see this movie, there's a lot of intersection I could go on for a while, but I think you get the point. A lot of high profile partisan liberal viewers did not enjoy what they interpreted to be blatantly pro war propaganda movie. The movie made by a man whose personal politics already seems to run counter to dos who stand against the film. When somebody does not do the job, we've got to let them go and then he would have therefore naturally and consciously made a movie that shows audiences each simplistic and glorified version of the war were just odd to say the least.

Speaker 1:          01:47          This that would be completely out of character for clinic sweet and director who has a record of making nuanced and often openminded films. The glamorizing negritude is killing in western movies addressing gender and class issues for women in sports. You minimizing Japanese soldiers during the Second World War. Tackling the corrupt criminal justice system of the early 20th century and being criticized by some conservatives for gramitizing to homosexual private life of FBI director, Edgar Hoover, not you accurately point out the true message of American sniper. We can make use of literary theorist Kenneth Burke's cluster analysis method, which attempts to seek out the film's most important recurring terms with the positive god term on the one hand and a counter acting devil term on the other in between floats, subordinate terms that align with either of the main terms, but that can change their value as the story progresses.

Speaker 1:          02:39          But before we get into any of that, let's start by taking a closer look at our gods term. In order to truly understand the character of Chris Kyle and why he does what he does, we first need to examine how his value system works. Traveling back to is you. If we can observe how is strict upbringing in a highly conservative household late the foundations for the man. He would later from his father stoic sheepdog philosophy of protecting the defense lists from all this evil in the world. Two sermons about God's plan for his believers, yet unknown path to glory. And lastly a lesson in perseverance. Get back here. You don't ever leave your rifle in the dirt.

Speaker 1:          03:19          Yes sir. All these teachings work for her to concept with family, to protect it from danger, to believe in God's plan for his glory and to never abandoned one's duty towards it. It's this value system to cal carries with them into adulthood and that after perhaps having laid dormant for some time miss reawakened by the terrorist attacks on the American embassies, cows, wards and emotional reaction indicating that his notion of family has extended into the nation as family and attack on the nation is indirectly and attack on his own family, which pushes him into joining the navy seals who like many other military units actively try to form a tight knit group of non quitters

Speaker 2:          04:01          for the faint of heart there they wash out the quit on my most men don't quit,

Speaker 1:          04:06          so Chris, despite has apparent old age, stays faithful to his beliefs and doesn't quit and this other newly perceived family. Another instance where Chris's values influence events is when he manages to grab the interest of his future wife Taya after he denounced as a fellow seal for cheating and quitting on his marriage. Kristen say a shared love for family. You make sure subsequent relationship grow and things seem to be shaping up to cal's divine plan for awhile until one fateful September morning,

Speaker 2:          04:32          no

Speaker 1:          04:43          wars devil term that slowly starts to take control over at Kyle's family values. The first value that's bootsy that's asked is a sheepdog notion of protecting family, which as we've seen consists of three layers. His family at home is military family and his country. As Cruz is deployed to Iraq, we see him excelling in his role on the battlefield as an overwatch sniper, keeping the evils of war from his military family, as well as keeping it as far away as possible from his own direct family.

Speaker 2:          05:14          The call home was supposed to go,

Speaker 1:          05:18          however, he slowly finds out that it's impossible to do either of these things because regardless of his extra tease as a sniper, he's proven to be unable to protect every single marine under his watch. And he also has to live with the fact that in order to protect his family, he's forced to destroy another. And even though he does manage to protect countless of troops from physical harm, he can't shield them from the mental harm. The war inevitably causes them as is exemplified when Chris runs into his little brother who is about to return home from the war,

Speaker 2:          05:49          just tired man

Speaker 1:          05:53          cows building frustration over his inability to protect everyone is when he witnesses to depths of an Iraqi family. He vouched to protect after having extracted vital information from them and thereby consciously having involved them into the war. His first deployment ends those with the notion that war and protecting food war inevitably makes collateral damage of family, which we can see even more clearly is cal returns home with his feelings of frustration and guilt gone on resolve that quickly becomes clear that far from having left the war behind Chris has brought it home in the form of mental trauma is developing ptsd causes him to become increasingly disconnected from his family life. Having become absent minded, he constantly slips back to the evils of the war, the death of the rocky family. Perhaps the perfect metaphor for Chris's inability to keep war and family separate is when he's watching American troops getting shot by his rival sniper while sitting next to at Christmas tree, the epitome of everything. Family, God and peace, still unwilling to talk about the war. Chrysalis does unwittingly destroying his own family. His tie tries to tell him that Chris talk about it. You're not protecting me by not talking about, but in Kyle's mind, protecting through wars, the only way of protecting both his direct family as well as his other families. Yeah,

Speaker 3:          07:06          not about them. It's about us.

Speaker 1:          07:10          For Chris quitting the war would mean quitting on the navy seals or his family in Iraq, which is not something has value system allows him to do and it's why we see him returning again and again and again. This no quitting mentality is supported by his confidence and finding glory in God's divine plan as he carries with him Miss Old Bible wherever he goes and he continuously, it's sure as tie that you to let him leave, right. What do you, it's all part of the plan for Chris. His bath to glory is in a self perceived crusade against the forces of evil in Iraq, which seems to be why he's sporting a crusader cross to to you, and why he believes in the righteousness of the u s presence. There we're singing God's blessing and Glory Dafur become associated with war, it and family. However, cal's never ending. Crusade becomes increasingly reckless and vengeful over time as he sets out on a personal mission to find and kill the people responsible for killing his fellow soldiers and Iraqi family does. Transformation can be seen in seals adopting to punish her logo. Hey, marvel, anti hero who will do anything to get revenge against the people who killed his family, but it's also noticeable in cals behavior at home where he's now completely disconnected from his family leading to tie, giving him an ultimatum.

Speaker 3:          08:23          If you leave again, the puppy here when you get back,

Speaker 1:          08:29          not only does cal's plan and obsession almost destroy what he holds most dear. It also comes at a cost of two of his friends, one of them whose best friend Mark Lee. It would be preacher turned. Soldier was slowly becoming disillusioned by the war and Carl's dogmatic interpretation of God's blend for glory. This is shown through to strongly worded anti war letter. He leaves behind my question. Yeah,

Speaker 3:          08:51          it's one that's glory fade away and become a rock look. Oh, and then just to tie it means by which consumes what completely.

Speaker 1:          09:02          It's a message of the glorification that only really hits cow when he's finally got the chance to take up. Mustafa you sear in sniper that started his crusade against orders to stand down. Chris chooses to pull the trigger instead to protect his fellow soldiers, to show his no quitter mentality and most of all to finally find catharsis in his crusade or Ms Bland for glory. As we staff our false. However, there's no great celebration. No Real Catharsis for Chris as his friends speaks. Two words, mission accomplished, perhaps referring to George W. Bush infamous speech after the initial vision of Iraq had ended. Of course, the war was far from over. At that point, there was no real nuance spot out plan for postwar, our rack giving, but the false sense of catharsis. Something similar happens after kyle takes that shot. Their position now exposed, Kyle's team is quickly surrounded by and surgeons as they face certain death, you realize is that his crusade will ultimately be the end of him and his family. As he finally decides it's time to go home.

Speaker 3:          10:02          Oh, I'm ready. I'm ready to go home.

Speaker 1:          10:06          By sheer luck, the team manages to escape then surgeons for sand storm. A perfect metaphor for the fog of war, perhaps signifying Chris struggling with his internal moral consciousness, his struggle between family and war, and it's here where he visually quits on both the war and dogmatism of his father's upbringing by leaving his rifle in the dirt. However, even after having, via aligned with his family and taking up a healthier sheepdog role by helping disabled and traumatized veterans deal with their experiences, Chris too, we would ultimately become a victim of the war. So I would argue that far from being a pro war pro neoconservative propaganda movie, American sniper can much more accurately be described as an anti war movie. The pay thing. It's destructive nature towards family, whether it'd be to cal family, to navy seal brotherhood, or even the family. You'll rival sniper.

Speaker 1:          10:57          Mustafa more always in fates the home and corrupts and destroys it from event director Clint Eastwood made a film condemning the war, not the warrior, and criticizing the neoconservative Baltic step resorted to it. American sniper is not a direct adaptation of Chris Gal's life and it isn't meant to be. These would seem serve roughly adapted a story to make you broader statement to make a film that respects and puts emphasis on its veterans. One that helps us understand their experience and one that asks us not to forget their struggle in the words of Bradley Cooper, for me and for Clinton, this movie was always a character study about what the plate is for a soldier. If it's not this movie, I hope to God another move he will come out where it will shed light on the fact of what service men and women have to go through and that we need to pay attention to her. Yvette's it doesn't go any further than that. It's not a political discussion about war even. It's a discussion about the reality and the reality is that people were coming home. We have to take care of them.

Speaker 1:          12:05          All right. Thank you all so much for watching and seeing how much hate American sniper received. They just had to express my views of the movie. So, um, I hope this, this video clear things up a little bit. Uh, I want to thank Danielle Key Mirman for his thesis on partisan reception of American sniper, which was a big influence for this video, uh, Dell's extensively into how and why political audiences came to such a widely different interpretation of the film. Lastly, if you want to help us out and sustain this channel, hop on over to Patriot or a paypal a while you can leave as a dollar. Anyways, thank you all again for watching happy 4th of July to our American viewers and I hope to see you all the next one.
