Speaker 1:          00:03          Director of Gamma Delta opens is 2001 film the Devil's backbone with the question [inaudible] the tragedy in question here, referring to the gruesome murder of the young orphan boy certainty in a subsequent haunting of the orphanage by his restless ghost in search of recognition and justice, what does El Toro himself a stated that drama that unfolds within the confines of this isolated complex serves merely as a microcosm of the tragedy. His question is really it

Speaker 1:          00:38          and the war goes on. The Spanish civil war was a brutal conflict at gripped Spain bites throat. Between the years of 1946 and 1939 it was a war fought and countless places spanning the entire country, a struggle between the fascist and nationalist forces of soon to be dictator General Francisco Franco and Republican forces, which consisted mainly of communists, anarchists, and democratic loyalists of the Republican government. When the sounds of war, we're finally silenced on the 1st of April, 1949 to Spanish felling as nationalists Flag Hung Victoria's into capitol of Madrid and it would remain there until the fall of the regime with the death of Franco. In 1975 more than half a million lives would be lost in the killing around 450,000 roughly to country numbers only to be dwarfed by another word. I would start only five months later. The Spanish civil war due to its limited scope and occurrence with the second world war, would dare for quickly become but a side note in the minds of the international community, but more importantly, it was an event that due to it's indescribable savage killing between former neighbors, friends and family, the people of Spain would choose to forget and they're a national memory and it was exactly this conscious form of repression that broad director, Dan Eltoro Toro to state that the civil war, which was never completely healed in Spain, is it ghost anything pending as it goes in recognizing the lingering presence of this national trauma and the dangers for getting one's best Deltoro decided to dedicated free films, do engage, explain and find meaning in this still sensitive topic.

Speaker 1:          02:07          The first one, as I've mentioned, is what he calls his first real film, the devil's backbone. The second one would come out four years later in the form of Pan's labyrinth, and the third one in the trilogy is to this day still to be announced. Now, it's important to note that neither of these films are straightforward historical war films. The Devil's backbone unfolding during the latter stages of the war is a gothic ghost stories set in an orphanage about to protagonists Carlos interacting with the ghost of the murdered some something Pan's labyrinth found the other hand taking place in 1944 can be most accurately described as the twisted fairy tale of the young Ophelia. A girl who explores a fantastical world with the desire to return as a magical Princess Peter Pan like eternal child of the underworld decide Christopher Hartney deltoros decision to use to fantastical to say something profound about historical makes sense.

Speaker 1:          02:55          Both of these genre seth historically been utilized to explore and engage chaos, drama, and the repressed parts of a culture in the collective minds of its citizens. In awards of young Ian Psychoanalyst, Donald call check when human resources are on the available archetype or resources will present themselves in the devil's backbone. Does is manifested through the looming presence of specters and first one being the ghost of Sunday, an orphan boy murdered by the violin. Jacinto, the oldest orphan into complex is deaf, go seemingly unrecognized by both the staff of the orphanage as well as the altar boys living there. Kai May the only witness to the murder has kept his mouth shut and any attempt to bring up Sunday's fate as quickly shut down, chaotic. In fact, any mentioned of death or tragedy seems to have been deemed inappropriate by the leaders of the orphanage. Carlos, the protagonist of the story is never told of the demise of his father on the front line and the other kids still seem to be receiving letters from their parents. Parents who haven't been alive since before. The moment the boys respect to flee, set food on the desolate orphanage grounds.

Speaker 1:          03:59          The second spectrum of the film can then be identified as the ongoing, yet physically epson civil war or in more visual terms, the always lingering presence off the unexploded bomb in the middle of the courtyard dropped on the same night of something's death. The device become spiritually connected to the boys, restless spirit and the looming presence of sudden death. Both are physically debt and yet both are shown to be alive on a fantastical level.

Speaker 2:          04:25          Sure.

Speaker 1:          04:30          Not Unlike to unresolved trauma of the war are asking for recognition and guiding Carlos along the way in a search to find answers by engaging with the specters as similar thing happens in Pan's labyrinth, which a fairytale manifests itself in the world of the younger Ophelia in order for her to make sense or for life after the traumatic death of her father and his replacement by the fascist captain vidal affiliate has been forced to leave for us. It into a world in which to realm of the fantastical and in material have been all but forgotten.

Speaker 1:          05:01          We can see this in the affiliates metaphorical till the magical rows of immortality sitting at the top of a mountain and slowly wittering away. Yes, the people below with become too scared of the poisonous foreigns guarding it, I think become obsessed with their fear of death and pain. This mentality manifests itself all throughout the story, but it's most evident than captain Verdell. He places high value in all things material and orderly, but outright despises any story that doesn't align with his fascist ideology or that isn't grounded in what he calls reality of the world. The reality that for Ophelia is buddy foreground for what lies underneath. Right at the start of the movie, we can already see that she notices things that others don't pay attention to or are just unable to see a few les replacing of the eye back into its proper place, signifying the opening of a new dimension.

Speaker 1:          05:55          In fact, I'll throw it goes out of his way to depict how Captain Fidel blinds is victims time and again until he himself is blinded at the end of the film. Metaphorically depicting that all of these characters that have been forced to leave or unconsciously separated from the realm of the fantastical and it is not unique to just pan's labyrinth in the devil's backbone. I have the antagonist. Jacinto is also shown to be bloodshot displaying his feelings of rage and lack of clairvoyance. The world of the Dell and just Cynthia was one dominated by the material, one that places rigid and often gri boundaries on what is accepted as the story of the nation and of the culture contrasted by the limitless roundness and colorfulness of the mythological world. It all story in particular as one dominated by time and is connected obsession with death, always checking the watch his father gave him and physically living in a room that reminds us of the insight of a clock, giving him somewhat of a resemblance to did time and death obsessed Captain Hook and Peter Benn is sole purpose in life being to die and men on the battlefield like his father before him and to have a son to do it all over again.

Speaker 1:          07:05          He's so certain of his beliefs that he can't even conceive of any other outcomes to countered his worldview. Delta Rho device is fantastical worlds into a strictly masculine brotherly story and a sisterly feminine one. Both can be seen as young in stories of self maturation in absence of the proper archetypal parental guidance according to professor Jordan B. Peterson is research into recurring archetypal symbolism. We can distinguish between the great fodder often representing a society's culture and order and the great mother often representing the earth and the exploration of novelty. Both these archetypes have a wise, benevolent side and a tyrannical destructive side. Degrade moderate provides the hero with the promise of a safe haven to fall back on s he or she makes the journey into the unknown. Her opposite, however, is over protective and always tries to shield the protagonist from facing any adversity. The wise fodder or king on the other hand protects the protagonist, instills confidence and encourages him or her to face the unknown and to take self responsibility as an individual is tyrannical side, however, consumes the individual through jealousy and resentment in order to sustain his own power.

Speaker 1:          08:15          This particular archetype reveals itself in the field, yes, encountered with the pill men and ghastly humanoid creature who guards eight lavish feast and consume some children who tried to eat from it. That's throw himself as stated that the bill men represents the power hungry fascism of Captain Verdell, the elder leaf, Francesco Franco and the Spanish Catholic church also visually mirroring the monster with these characters as they dine on a similar lavish feast. On a more general level, however, the creature represents the tyrannical nature of to tell Terry aneurysm as a whole is del Toro shows us a pile of children's shoes echoing the last generation of the Holocaust and the Second World War in the devil's backbone. Jacinto functions as a similar diamond, often shown in the same frame with the unexploded bomb. He is seen beating, cutting, and eventually even consciously mass murdering the other children in this feelings of power, hungry, rage and resentment, revealing that he has always been the real ticking time bomb.

Speaker 1:          09:11          On top of that, his violent behavior has also shown to be rubbing off on the children around him, which is depicted through to character of crime. Me who mimics this destructive behavior during the better first half of the film. Even the orphanage itself seems to represent a place that consumes the maturation of its children with its entrance mimicking a mouth eating. The children who enter. They'll toro then seems to use this to make a cautionary statement about the psychology behind the actions of us antagonist. Jacinta will so first orphan to be adopted by Carmen and doctor [inaudible] who would serve as his makeshift barents of sorts. However, a garment is seen engaging in a sort of oil depaul relationship with the boy and the doctor confesses that he has never been fully dedicated to his tasks. On top of that, Carmen is openly ashamed that the relationship and mocks the boy for his lack of a fulfilled potential.

Speaker 1:          10:10          It isn't perhaps no wonder that just into stumped itself, grow for lack of a kingdom gave rise to his feelings of rage and resentment that would fuel his desire to burn down as shameful past. So besides serving as a means of dealing with the press trauma, both Carlos and the Helios fantastical journeys take on the role of cautionary archetypical tales of self maturation. Carlos in his friend's masculine journey is one of the development of unrelenting courage to increasingly engaged with the repressed and the unknown. Learning to take self responsibility and ultimately taking on the tyrant with the help of lessons from history and a finally, enlightened wise father affiliace journey, on the other hand is a distinctly feminine one, or in the words of del Toro. And most of them, the fantasy world I think she wouldn't dream of, is really going back to the valley of her mother. And that's the reason why she accesses the magical realm through her mother's belly and why the film is littered with Fallopian imagery from the Fonz had to to old thick tree to her bed frame. But in order for Ophelia to return to the womb and become a princess, she has to show courage, the fines towards absolute authority and most importantly on ultimate act of selflessness and self sacrifice in servers off an uninvited siblings.

Speaker 1:          11:27          So when a symbolical level, Ophelia has to prove herself to beat it, great mudder in order for her to be reborn as to princess. But this doesn't mean that they'll toro revises or sugarcoats history completely. In fact, he actively seems to make a point out of his trilogies opening question by using similar story setups, mirroring certain previous events, and even using the same motivations and outfits for similar characters. [inaudible] by the end of their journey, Carlos and his friends may have overcome the tyranny of Jacinto, but they leave the orphanage traumatized and physically scarred. Ultimately finding dare to Mys. Years later in Pan's labyrinth, Ophelia on her part is still shot and killed by Captain Verdell. Ironically, fulfilling her wish to remain a child forever, but it's exactly in the selfless act of protection that she makes room for an eventual better future by refusing to be controlled by eight baffle logical ideology and by giving her brought her to a generation that would eventually overthrown a fascist regime and who now is both a foot in the material as well as the fantastical world, his kingdom that was previously denied from Jacinto.

Speaker 3:          12:38          Can you let me, Jane,

Speaker 1:          12:46          it's true all of this that del Toro ultimately expresses the power of the fantastical when the archetypal, although his characters might be faded to remain kids forever, their memories for God and repressed like the real life trauma of the Spanish civil war and capsulated in time and nameless in their anonymity. It's exactly in our engagement with these fantastical tragedies into retailing and revival after archetypical symbolism that there are lessons skin reemerge into our own lives, bead in the form of another famous eternal child and his group of lost boys facing off against the time and death obsessed captain hook or in the form of numerous gothic stories or in Delta arose own fantastical worlds, worlds that are asking to be explored that force us to be honest with ourselves and our reality. Do you have the courage to confront that? What makes us uncomfortable to recognize the dangers and pitfalls along the way whilst trying to navigate ourselves into to right Beth to dive into the unknown, to be reborn and then to do it all over again?
