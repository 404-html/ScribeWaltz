Speaker 1:          00:03          One of the best films that I saw in 2014 was two grand Budapest hotel, written and directed by West Anderson was Edison is of course known for distinctive style in particular his fullness for perfectly symmetrical shots, which she spoke loft and hated for as less than some screenplays states. Some people consider west Anderson a genius death converse conventional film language into its own dialectic while others claim it is artfulness mistake and for art film devoid of meaning. I think these opposing opinions own wes Anderson style stem from a fundamental paradox in how people look at movies and even broader nature. Perfect symmetry is a natural and conventional cinematic language is designed to have the audience not notice consciously, at least the manufactured nature or what happens on screen. West Anderson therefore draws attention away from the story and characters on screen and to watch his cinematic style.

Speaker 1:          01:06          Yet, although symmetry is a natural, people do find it beautiful. It's movies therefore function more as a painting or storybook than conventional narrative cinema. I was argued this, that it is critical for us and listen to match this narrative characters and dialogue with a cinematic style so that is fewer accepted as fitting instead of all natural, and I think he does this perfectly and the Grand Budapest hotel where a moonrise kingdom and as soon alludes to a cinematic stele mimicking the metrical storybooks, susie bishop carries twitter in the Grand Budapest hotel. He creates a frame story, a story within a story, within a story, within a story. He even matches the aspect ratio of the narratives, different time periods to the aspect ratio that was confessional for cinema in the years. The story finance itself to this frame story, the Grand Budapest hotel is submersed in Ostalgie throwing us back into a more elegant time or aristocracy is civility and taste. This nostalgia is towards the magical world of the past, or even as his hinted or Walter Earth is even older.

Speaker 2:          02:19          To be frank, I think his world had vanished long before he ever rented it, but I will say he certainly sustained the illusion with a marvelous grace.

Speaker 1:          02:30          I would say that this nostalgic, elegant world matches perfectly with innocence painting slash storybook, like cinematic style. Even the 40 aspect ratio of the 19 thirties that he uses for the part of the story that is set in that time period works excellent for symmetric shots. This is all even further complemented by the dialogue. Once you Gustaf especially converses in an elegant aristocratic way which is in tune. The magical world that is created

Speaker 2:          03:02          rudeness is merely the expression of fear. People fear they won't get what they want. The most dreadful and unattractive person earlier needs to be loved and they will open up like a flower. I'm reminded of a verse. The painter's brush touch the incubate phase, ends of Nimble bristles and color. Granted, her life is cheap.

Speaker 1:          03:24          The danger of this or wherever it is that this dialogue cool to receive the same critique as wes Anderson cinematic style often does that it is pretentious and listen solstice by frequently having mature Gustaf breaking as elegant. Speaking with a more professional tone.

Speaker 2:          03:42          I've never seen her like that before. No, sir. She was shaking like a shitting dog. Truly,

Speaker 1:          03:51          this creates comedic moments and serves as a wink to the audience. It shows an awareness of the criticalness style

Speaker 2:          03:59          you see that are still glimmers of civilization left and this barbaric slaughter house that was once known as humanity. Indeed, that's what we provide in our own modest, humble, insignificant. Okay.

Speaker 1:          04:15          Another problem is that by drawing attention to a cinematic style, wes Anderson, districts and distances to audience from the emotional lives of the characters on screen. Most of innocence films are a mixture of tragedy and comedy is cinematic style works perfectly for comedic purposes. For example, I think people entered a frame in many ways, just like Edgar Wright sometimes does birth more central to establish our. His tracking shots is tableau shots.

Speaker 2:          04:44          He's a ruthless adventure of a con artist who preys on mentally sick. Old Ladies probably box them to bed with all my friends.

Speaker 1:          05:02          This tableau shot of mature Gustaf in Jill created an absurdity death folks after birth. It also distracts from the seriousness of his situation because when it comes to more serious emotional moments, it is precisely this kind of shot that can distance the audience from the characters. In previous movies, Edison therefore returned to cinematic techniques outside of his own style. During these moments, for example, he returns to the more conventional over the shoulder shots in moonrise kingdom. When Sam and Susie confessed the love for each other as bought all states at an emotional peak, innocence sharply violates the film's intrinsic norm by bringing in their common technique. West Emerson doesn't do this in the Grand Budapest hotel, however, birth uses lighting color and some techniques that fit within this intrinsic style to convey important emotional moments. The audience in this tableau shots, a lighting change signifies that a more serious moment is about to happen, and another line inq combined with a closeup focuses on the tears. Old Zero.

Speaker 2:          06:10          You see, I never speak to him, I guess because even the thought of her name, I'm unable to control my emotions. Well, I suppose there's no way around it.

Speaker 1:          06:23          In a similar way, a shelter is to convey Agatha so love of serious life center usher in a close up with soft lighting and light circling binder. Wes Anderson also use objects and positioning to convey emotional cues when we see more sugary stuff in his solitary small room where he eats dinner alone, which is a break with the royal elegant self-assured, Short speaking persona of material stuff. The camera lights over a couple of bottles layer, the peneche his favorite perfume. Perfume is this part of his more intimate and it's rather lonely personality when he shares this perfume with zero does signify serious access to star spiritual world and their deep friendship.

Speaker 2:          07:10          I owe you my life. You are my dear friend and process. Every private, if you. You must admit. I'm so sorry he's here. We're brothers.

Speaker 1:          07:26          We can also see this in their positions in the frame, in the beginning of the film, zero is often seen in the background. While most sugar stuff, the more dominating character at that point is shown larger and closer to the front of the frame. The same compositional structure can be seen with the antagonist of the film birth with regards to Ciro and more good stuff. Later in the film, their friendship develops and they become more equals zero rescue of material, good stuff from jail. We see this shift within the mission seven s, they both now shared frame more equally yet it's the most clear example where wes Anderson cues and important emotional moments too. Cinematic style is in the train scene near the end. This scene is similar to an earlier train scene, yet completely different where the first train scene is shown in warm colors and there was room for comedic moments.

Speaker 2:          08:21          It's not a very flattering portrait. I'm afraid I was once considered a great but wants the f stand for Fritz France, France. I knew it.

Speaker 1:          08:31          West End Shin shows the later train scene in black and white to convey what would be one of the saddest days of life when will show stuff is shoved debt.

Speaker 3:          08:43          What happened in the end and the and

Speaker 1:          08:46          they shot him. The grants Budapest hotel signifies, I think the peak of West innocence ability folk, both comedy as emotional strategy to his own distinctive cinematic style. The film is a wonderful mix of charm, humor, and sadness accumulation off west innocence work as a director and writer that will make you want to revisit the Grand Budapest hotel again and again and again and again, thank you so much for watching. And every time I see this film I appreciated more and more and it is slowly turning into one of my favorite films ever.
