Speaker 1:          00:03          The breaking of the fourth wall has been defined as a character acknowledging the existence of the audience outside of the film. But besides merely recognizing the existence of the separate reality, Martin Scorsese, shutter island actually invites the audience to completely identify with its main character by placing the camera inside a mirror, a the, uh.

Speaker 1:          00:36          Now what's remarkable about this shot is that it helps you clarify why consecutive viewings of shutter island changed the experience of the film completely. You could even say it at, it's like you're watching a completely different film. We start off by watching and mystery thriller about you was martial Teddy Daniels and a search warrant escape patients from remote Ashlyn mental institution. But mostly the story is about his search for the killer of his wife, the arsonist and route latus who supposedly also a patient on the island. As the story unravels, we find out that the two marshals might've become the victim of a blog by Ashley through sinus and from revealing dark secrets about the institution. And it's only you had to climbing. So the story that we discovered a real truth, you're name is andrew latest. The 67th patient had dash cliff is you andrew?

Speaker 1:          01:24          No. I suspect most of yours were shocked by this plot twist and with the evidence laid out and it's equal, might have fought and how did I not see this before? However, some people continue to deny teddy's true identity seeding that Ashlyn is in fact a sort of of naziesque CIA lab of some kind. So clear up some of these misunderstandings. I will argue that the fourth wall newer shot is key to comprehending the truth behind shutter island and how to fill manages to make audiences turn a blind eye towards reality. Where are the kids? It's important to note that the rector of Martin Scorsese stated in an interview that the entire movie takes place inside of Teddy's head. Notice that there's not a single scene that doesn't depict teddy as the focal point of the story or even as seen without his mere presence. On top of that, the audience is constantly reminded of the tragic goodness of Andrew's made up. Karen.

Speaker 2:          02:15          None an exactly square with teddy. Danielle's the man, the legend that give you that

Speaker 1:          02:19          Teddy's profession as a US marshall and his role as protector of justice also give his character superiority over to seemingly untrustworthy doctors of ash cliff, and if that wasn't enough for the audience to aligned with Teddy, he's also revealed to be a war hero having liberated victims of the Holocaust from a Nazi concentration camp and from the get go. It is obvious what's Teddy's preconceptions about the Asheville if institution are

Speaker 3:          02:42          same, something like that before.

Speaker 1:          02:45          Both the framing and a dramatic, almost menacing music playing in the background attitude unparalleled at this facility might not be any less evil than the infamous Nazi death camps. It's a real tragedy about his characters that he cannot come to terms with the death of his and suffers from a massive amount of guilt for having executed a number of cam guards during the war. Teddy's really shown to be a victim rather than a perpetrator and all of this really makes it difficult for the audience not to fully aligned with the protagonist and really end up being just as delusional as the main character himself.

Speaker 1:          03:23          Andrew, please do. However, even during the first viewing of the film, you can already notice that Teddy's world is a little strange. Many of the characters don't really seem to act as one would expect them to in certain situations. The guards seem to be irrationally on Agis steadying chuck arrive and that's supposedly because of the escape patient, but later shown to be bored. When ted, he launches a search party on the island. Patients are waving and looking at setting, but not a chuck and doctors and nurses are kind of laughing at Teddy's attempts to interviewed him. Very impression defense mechanisms. Even chuck eggs out of character as he struggles to get his firearm out of his belt. Just seems like an odd thing to happen to you. As Marshall and especially for film, it's a bit emphasis on such a subtle and arguably insignificant occurrence and even said he shows irrational behavior as he starts to act on impulse and becomes increasingly violent and reckless in a search for a man who looks almost too fantastical to be real.

Speaker 1:          04:20          Then there's the fact that the film has a number of continuity errors that are so obvious that they kind of possibly, you haven't missed buddy editor on accident. In one scene, the character pretends to drink water out of a nonexisting glass only for the glass, so your peer empty in the next shot. These jump cuts enhance the feeling that said he's living in a sort of dreamlike state. Hence why both the character and audience start to question the realness of the protagonists world. However, all of this can still be explained with the argument. That's the entire thing. It was just a set up and said he was just being drugged and manipulated into believing that he is in fact the perpetrator himself. Why are you here?

Speaker 1:          04:59          I killed my wife. Now there's really one scene or rather one musical piece that quite subtly manages to debunk this train of thought called tip top caroline and string. It ain't mine. Besides the fact that the music parallels the general feeling of the scene. Courtside for strings and piano and a minor by Gustav Mahler remains a rat or odd choice of music to say the least receipt at the music triggers a response in Teddy to brings him back to the headquarters with the Dachau concentration camp. We're just seeing music was playing on a record player. Now why is this odd? Because Khrushchev Mahler was Jewish and his music was subsequently banned by the Nazis. Secondly, the quartet for strings belongs to malls earlier and lesser known work. So why on earth would a s s chem water and a half this exact piece playing in his headquarters?

Speaker 1:          05:43          It seems highly unlikely that this event actually happened and it makes us wonder about the reality of Teddy's memories. The music adds a sort of grimm brothers' fairy till like quality to the memory. Well, snow was falling everywhere and bodies life frozen on the ground. The thing is real life footage shows that there was no real snow to be seen during the liberation of the camp. Adding further doubt about just how trustworthy you teddy's perspective is. A little research also reveals the Mahler actually never finished a quartet and had trouble finding his own voice leaving in fragmented and isolated in between his work. The parallel of Andrew Dan seems obvious as he struggles to find his own voice and hides behind the voice of Teddy taking the ferry back in the morning, come on show, and to prove that Andrew is in fact hiding behind this fake persona.

Speaker 1:          06:29          We only have to look at the opening scene of the movie. After Teddy froze up, he looks into the mirror, which in film often indicates that the character has a split personality on top of that, and you can see that half of this phase is illuminated by the sun, whereas the other half is left in the dark, signifying teddy's buried real personality even unknowingly states his main goals, the entire story. This theme returns multiple times and comes to climates when Andrew's face fully illuminated and is finally accepted reality as it is. Or when did you notice that little bandaid on his forehead? Now that's gone here to indicating that he is no longer covering up his wounded personality. Oh, I remember that part where chuck is praising Daddy. Notice that the legend also explains that Teddy's personality is not real, but just a made up story.

Speaker 1:          07:13          But the most important theme of all to be found in the opening scene is a substance that both literally and figuratively keeps us seen a float water. So at the end of the story is revealed at Andrew's wife drown to children in the lake and it's wide. Teddy's so nauseated by water and like psychological practice steady. You're slowly but surely put an increasing contact with water until he ultimately comes as close to a strauma as possible by diving into the sea. But Teddy's physical appearance and demeanor also changed dramatically during the film. He starts his journey with a rat or collected and no nonsense attitude towards the world. But as the story progressed, as he slowly stripped from the things that make him who he is versus gun, then his clothes, then his attitude and ultimately his entire made up self. As I stated earlier, Andrew came up with Teddy's persona only because he was unable to deal with the violence and guilt that he's had to endure in his life. This sort of cyclical nature of violence and cruelty that is part of humanity and in which he actively pursue because what ultimately drove andrew into insanity, no matter how much he denies it away. Thanks for harmless, but you can be controlled, but I know,

Speaker 1:          08:22          oh,

Speaker 4:          08:26          we've known each other for centuries.

Speaker 1:          08:29          I also notice that the sadistic water isn't named on purpose because wharton is an Anagram for Andrew and there are more of these anagrams to be found as is shown by Dr Kali at the climax of the story, don't we? Phil Sue explained to name of Teddy's faith partner chuck all who turns out it's speed mysterious. Dr Nian couldn't tell the US Marshall's office, but that he's a defense mechanism. Surprise mother fucker because fanatically chuck all sounds a lot like chuckle, which in turn indicates his character's rule is jester or trickster. Within the realm of story as a whole. The side of companion characters are known for their miss chief and their motivation to push to protagonist interchange and that only does chuck trick teddy into believing that he is his partner, but he also has an active interest in helping Andrew to accept reality as it is. Nice. Makes me one. Yeah. WHATSAPP, which would be worse.

Speaker 1:          09:23          Live is a monster and a day is a good man and to me this is the magic and brilliance of shutter island. It knows it's burgers and making the audience identify fully with a fake character and arguably manages to make us just as delusional as Andrew himself. On top of that, it gives us a fascinating look into the psychology of this tragic character trauma and the nature of reality. It shows us just how powerful our minds can be and the perspective really is everything because when we fully aligned with the point of view or a certain belief, we sometimes feel to see the truth even if it's laid out right in front of her eyes.
