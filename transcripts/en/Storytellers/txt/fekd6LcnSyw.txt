Speaker 1:          00:05          Mazes have fascinated us for tens of thousands. So if years from ancient wall drawings to Greek and Roman mythology to modern film mazes and labyrinths have on some level always strongly resonated with the human experience and seeing at a symbolical layered deeper than the merely physical experience you get from exploring it's corridors, which is a reason why I got intrigued by Denis Villeneuve's 2014 film prisoners and how it uses mazes as a symbol in prisoners. We never get to see amaze in its physical form. In fact, the maize is not even billy explicitly mentioned at all until later in the story. I look totally amazed that a map guarding fundraisers remaining in the background for the better first half of the film, yet it's significant. Shoot, not be understated as the nice film of himself seems to have somewhat of a mild obsession with these puzzles, with characters having to venture through both physical and mental corridors, trying not to lose themselves in search of answers, answers about family, about what's right and what's wrong about life, death, what connects us through language and about faith in the face of evil.

Speaker 1:          01:12          If you'll notice, puzzle is one that focuses on the metaphorical and the psychological symbolism of the maze, rather than having it directly manifest itself in its physical form. Now, most western May, symbolism seems to be derived from the Greek myth of theseus and the minutes are which sells historian easiest, who needs to find and kill a monstrous beast at the center of the labyrinth using a threat of hair from his lover area. Ariadne needs to make sure he doesn't get lost along the way. Now compare that to the story of prisoners, which is about the kidnapping of two daughters and how the characters involve choose to react in order to get them back. The main focus here is placed on to character Keller Dover, a religious and protective, that who will do anything to keep his family safe and who will ultimately find the monster of his world with the help of a young girl and Loki and ace detective with a troubled background, tasks of the mission to solve the mystery and find a missing kids, so only metaphorical level.

Speaker 1:          02:06          The maze in prisoners then seems to loosely echoed as age old Greek myth. Both these men set out on a search using their own respective belief systems to lead them through the metaphorical maze of mystery and morality, hoping to find the truth at the center and to confront those responsible for the kidnapping. It perhaps more strikingly similar connection can be found in Nordic mythology involving a maiden horror princess stuck in the center of the maze, again, guarded by months, creature of source, the late poet Robert Graves, argued that what these very stories have in common is that they share a journey of the main character into Bofi physical as well as a mental underworld. Keller nurturers daughter might be a physical one, but as his faith is challenged and he's forced to confront the darker and more violent parts of his nature, his journey into the maze of the honor ruled increasingly becomes a mental one, so much so that his goal to protect his family almost ends up destroying as he neglects his traumatized wife and increasingly regresses back into old destructive habits and places until he'd literally descends into his own darkest place imaginable, helpless and unable to save his daughter.

Speaker 1:          03:14          Low key on the other hand, has to unravel the truth by descending into a more physical hell, trying to find order and disorder and literally facing off against the forces of the devil

Speaker 2:          03:24          making children disappears. The war we wage

Speaker 1:          03:28          the maze here seems to be a symbol for the chaos to Jones is set up under victims until they killed him off with the venom of a snake, the disciples symbol for the devil and the archetype of the maze and prisoners seems to stand for the opposite of Paradise. We're in the words of playwright Eugene, UNESCO. If goodness is order, evil must be disordered, straight path or the maze and it's if this insight, the Vilna of utilize this symbol to explore it and morality in the psychological nature of his character's Keller starts off as an open league devout Christian which has made quite obvious through his usage of prayers will be done on earth, be abundance of Christian symbolism surrounding him, his metaphorically appropriate job as a carpenter and through to names of his wife and mother. Moreover, Keller was shown to have a proclivity for orderliness and preparedness. Both traits that consciously define his character. Hurry for the best, prepare for the worst. However, as I've shown Keller's journey is one of increasing amounts of disorder, Aquestt that shakes his faith to at score as he sees himself for super form ever escalating brutalities on the person he suspects holds the key to his daughter. Well, he making me do this.

Speaker 1:          04:41          It's only at the end of this journey when he's in his darkest place that he finally surrenders and returns to his faith in God.

Speaker 2:          04:50          Check mine.

Speaker 1:          04:52          Detective Loki goes down eight decidedly different bath of the maze. His faith is based in both the Christian as well as the pagan. The eight point, it starts at two on his neck, referring to such things as redemption. Youmail. The strength and compassion is Mason Ring representing the search for enlightenment and rationality, aligning perfectly with his character and the posing to more emotionally based Geller, his odd name and turn. It comes from the Nordic God, Loki gunning, trickster and occasional helper of other gods.

Speaker 3:          05:20          And even though the ace tech, the fish show nuts to be immune to frustration, never truly breaks away from his beliefs,

Speaker 1:          05:26          ultimately help them in finding the missing children and solving the mystery. So besides acting as a symbol for the physical and metaphorical journey and judy underworld, the also comes to represent a psychological struggle. And the human brain, Stanley Kubrick show this in connection with the growing and sanity of Jack Torrance in the shining. But it's also a symbolism. It has ample historical grounding. Both Christian and pagan famous around the world have used a symbol of a linear one way labyrinth as a meditative baff way towards the center towards God self and the tree of life. Psychoanalysts, Carl Young, recognized labyrinths and similar figures of centers, sculpt Mandalis as a universally recurring archetype always standing for transformation, wholeness, and the totality of an individual's reality. The symbols can appear on the most common of household objects and things like below sweaters and picture frames which are also expressed through religion suggest a Christian Cross and the tree of life.

Speaker 1:          06:24          It wouldn't cross as I've shown his already abundantly represented them prisoners, but so was the tree of life. In fact, feel no spares, no expense. Focusing his lens on trees, making them part of the plot and having his main character interact with its substance. Trees undeniably take on an important role in the film and it's no coincidence that they too are connected to demand a symbol and by extension the labyrinth there. Physical form is also a direct metaphor for the human nervous system and the psychological state of our characters there. Bare and leafless branches aligning with our mood and mental state, which brings us back to the maze used by the Joneses. Now it's important to know that this particular maize is not a simple linear one far from it. There's a connection. Okay. Connection is, it's the last amazing book. There's no way out your core there.

Speaker 1:          07:10          LSD influenced May's processes specifically designed to mentally blocked our victims in their journey towards self individualization. It's a form of mind control that can help explain why Alex seems to be stuck in the mind of a 10 year old and why Bobby Taylor, although physically free is still obsessive. Lee trying to find a way out of his own mental health, but the maize is not just a tool for the Joneses to imprison children and learn their parents. It also goes to show how some of the characters had been stuck in there all along. It's revealed that gathers dad committed suicide in his house when Keller himself was still a team. The contrast between his study house and is the lap. It's aided parental home and calories, unwillingness to renovate the place. Like I keep telling your mother it's an old building will cost a fortune to fix it up revealed to us that the death of his father has still not been resolved in his mind.

Speaker 1:          07:56          Keller self grove as a teen has been stunted by this drama and in a way he is as much a prisoner as Alex Jones and Bobby Taylor has repressed feelings of rage and despair, awakened by the kidnapping of his daughter. Even killer's name meaning basement in German, speaks to his character is hidden away mental trauma and foreshadows his destiny perfectly. Holly Jones on herter and has been a prisoner of our own respect of maize for quite some time after their son died of cancer to one's devout Christians, lost our faith and decided to best to drag as many people into their mental health was possible. Even detective Loki seems to have struggled with his own maze during his troubled childhood. You know what? I spent six years old and having two boys home and you know the Hunnington boys hurting a fuck like you'd be a real treat for me.

Speaker 1:          08:40          What you telling me the difference of yours? That Loki is the only one of these characters who like in the story of Andrea [inaudible] is elevated himself from the mental trap raising his consciousness in the process. It's only fitting that he grows up to be an ace detective tasked with and guiding others out of the maze. If the Jones is our disturbance of the devil and trauma, Loki is to serve one of God and enlightenment. The maze is an incredibly relevant archetypal symbol of the human experience. It has been for thousands of years and it continues to do so in our world and in films like prisoners, the needs of El Nerf and writer Aaron goosy Koski. You have shown that through adequate, perhaps at times instinctive knowledge of his symbol it film can take on equality to test the ability to make us wonder about it long after the credits roll and not just because the symbol fits well with its story, but more importantly because it expresses a truth about the human experience that universally resonates of us as human beings and our endless struggle and journey towards a higher self. In the words of the late union psychoanalysts Edward See Whitman, one of the oldest images of the mystery of life, death, transformation and return is the labyrinth that depicts the way to be unknown. Center, the mystery of death and rebirth, your risk of the search, the danger of losing the way the quests and the finding and the ability to return.
