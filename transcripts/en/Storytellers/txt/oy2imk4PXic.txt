Speaker 2:          00:16          Really relating to these archetypes in the master. You don't have energy, you will not have a sense of if they have that stuff out in ways that are destructive coming from you and others.

Speaker 3:          00:36          What is masculinity? Is it an outdated and overall destructive construct or is it a necessary aspect of our humanity and the maturation of the individual? These are some of the questions that pervade the work of Michael Mann in general and his film collateral in particular because even though it's story of a gabby being forced to drive a contract at killer from hit to hit during one night in la might seem shallow. On the surface level, I believe it's symbolic and thematic structure provides a meaningful meditation on what it means to adopt they healthy masculinity and what happens when we attempt to repress it within ourselves and our societies.

Speaker 3:          01:18          In one of his early seminars, Dr [inaudible] discussed the mythological symbol of the men or the rider and the bull and the necessity of taming once interval, once masculine and animal nature. It is still the old hero cold of the man who was capable of teaming his own bull like fashions, the man who can overcome himself as almost a god and soda man who a has deemed himself he's overcome his fears. Thus, the catching of the ball in the net is an age old symbol for the self education of men. When we're first introduced to Max, we initially get a sentence that this is a man who's got his life together. He used to Gabby, who goes above and beyond to keep things orderly and clean. He used to driver who knows his roots by heart and ain't for maximum efficiency and take the 105 to 1:10 this fast, but he's also a people's person perceptive in his ability to put himself in his passenger shoes, compassionate to their struggles, to take the ticket because you needed a lot more than I do. Next is a man who excels at what he does, who blends them, doing so much more limo company. I'm putting together island limos and who even gets the number of the girl he likes without even having to ask for it. Max Truly seems to have it all. It's not until after a mysterious man from out of town and enters a scab that the facade begins to crumble.

Speaker 4:          02:41          Denver, Oh, you been driving 12 years. Really

Speaker 1:          02:45          suddenly, Max is excellence and orderliness as a cab driver are exposed to be barred if it's a weakness for in reality, Max is all order. No risk it chronic clunker of life like a faceless writer or missing action. He's become complacent, stuck in a routine, afraid of getting dirty, of taking a chance. If the girl he likes of delving into the unknown of facing his inner bull, why don't you just take the cat? Is Realistic. Ambitions have turned into an escapist dream meant to deceive himself as well as others from facing his reality. He grabs famous people around limousine companies, and that's what an achievement for. It's when we repress our inner masculinity, when we don't listen to our instincts, forfeit our assertiveness, our healthy aggression, you tell them to take next cab, and when we don't take responsibility for our lives, that life itself becomes rigid, constricting, claustrophobic, even the car becomes not a symbol of freedom, but one of bondage in a world seemingly indifferent to our existence like Max, we might dream or deceive ourselves and others into believing that nothing is wrong, but in reality when we repress our inner bull, we've become small, the pendant harmless and therefore vulnerable.

Speaker 1:          04:04          Not much more than cogs in a machine marionettes stuck in an endless loop naively waiting for the universe to give us our do.

Speaker 4:          04:12          Someday, someday my dream will come when you wake up and you'll discover it never happened.

Speaker 1:          04:18          You can avoid places where bools are to be found and if you don't see them, you will not be bothered, but you must be dodging all the time in order to avoid every possibility of a rousing. And since life provides endless opportunities for the emotions, there is no end of dodging which amounts to a panic or a chronic flunking of life. Vincent is in all aspects the opposite of Max, his shadow. He seems to fully identify with the masculinity of the symbolic bull. Everything Max is not. He shows himself to be assertive, alert, and most of all, aggressive and unpredictable. If Max is constricted by too much order and routine. Vincent relishes in chaos and improvisation

Speaker 4:          05:03          tough now behind the notes, not what's expected. Compromise.

Speaker 1:          05:09          And yet vincent is not the perfect manifestation of the writer who is deemed the passions of the bull. He believes that compassion and emotion of Max to be a hypocritical weakness of character, tens of thousands kill before sundown. Nobody's killed people that fastens, Nagasaki and Hiroshima. Did you bat an Imax? Do Vincent who grew up in an abusive household life has no inherent meaning or value. And the people who claim the opposite are lying to themselves.

Speaker 4:          05:35          Six hours. He's riding the subway before anybody notices his corpse doing laps around La people on an opposite next to him. Nobody notices.

Speaker 5:          05:44          I didn't notice the way he shot. He shot as a part of the landscape. All that kind of stuff was to kind of make him feel like an animal in la, that he is a product of this great urban sprawl that we live in, kind of a thing.

Speaker 1:          05:57          Vincent is a product

Speaker 6:          05:58          of modern urban society, an extreme rationalist nihilist his gray and colorless attire, revealing his inner hollowness ultimately act only to prove as resentful belief that the world is disconnected, cruel, and indifferent to existence or bringing death and misery jewelers. Vincent has become possessed by what Robert Moore termed the archetypical shadow warrior, the destructive side of masculinity. He's become detached from emotion and human relationships. He's disgusted by human pettiness and weakness and lifts only for his mission to him, the emotional bastions of the bull orbits, silly constructs of society or the human imagination ultimately holding one back from taking unrestrained action to achieve one's goals.

Speaker 6:          06:44          He takes what he needs from it. Symbolic animal for his own egoistic needs and things he can leave to carcass behind Giran now, double should not be killed. It is not a bull sacrifice because we have learned what that means. It means that you are deprived of life, drained if the very juice of life, if you kill the emotional powers in yourself, you get absolutely petrifying, dried up that therefore you must try to keep that ball live under certain conditions symbolized by the net and the tight feed. The ball must live, and so as these two opposites embarked together on their murderous night, an interplay of personalities and sue's visually Max's self-contained window into the world is cracked and his life is thrown into chaos. After you realize the true identity of his diabolical passenger, as he drives Vincent from hit to hit, his own insufficiency becomes clear as the veil of his lying is slowly being lifted.

Speaker 6:          07:38          I'm not up for this and as much as you'd love to escape, his reality is dependence on others will only bring him in the world. More pain. You attract attention. You're going to get people killed. He didn't need to be. He stuck into cab in the enclosed arena with his bull beside him. The only way out is to move forward into the unknown and it's in spending time with him that he slowly becomes more comfortable, more level headed, and begins to learn from Vincent's behavior slowly becoming more assertive. I'm going to have to stick this yellow cab of your fat ass and improvisational to realization dawns on Max that the only way to survive the night and to beat Vincent is to be like Vincent. The only way to team to dangerous bull is to consciously act like the bull. One of the aspects of that becoming a man is becoming dangerous if you're not dangerous. Power masking the maturation has to do with being empowered and knowing how to use it and when not to use.

Speaker 1:          08:39          Tell the guy behind me to put his gun away before I take it into Peter's bitter as definitely an embodying. His inner vincent. Max has discovered a new found power he previously didn't know he had, but by acting like the board of warrior, there's always the danger of becoming or being as its opposite

Speaker 3:          08:57          Vincent Vincent. So what I'm hearing seemingly blurring the line between the warrior and it's shadow counterpart, confusing to police on who the real hitman is supposed to be. It is only through to murder of detective fenning. That then since true ethological nature is exposed,

Speaker 4:          09:12          there's no reason, good reason, there's no bad reason they've ordered that a cop. You may notice this

Speaker 3:          09:21          in complete shock of incense. Nihilistic worldview Max makes a final move towards the completion of his inner journey by taking full responsibility for his life

Speaker 4:          09:31          straight up and looked at it. Sure.

Speaker 3:          09:36          His own hesitance to act, his passive defendants have caused them to stagnate in life, is weakness in lines if not only held himself back, but have also contributed to the suffering of others is fail of the seed has now been lifted completely and can therefore exists. No longer you don't want that's fucked yourself. Is deliberate. Crashing of this gap then becomes an image of a symbolic death and resurrection is shedding of weakness. The marionette dies and a writer arises. The bull has been teamed and the shadow warrior has failed in his attempt to convert him into his ranks. And the sleeves is sign, but there's one more step needed for Max to complete his inner journey,

Speaker 6:          10:23          the capacity to be a long time on whether or not you can care enough or something that is totally unrelated to your personal interests that you can see the trend,

Speaker 3:          10:38          egoic, Max strength sentences own being by sacrificing his own safety in order to save the woman he cares about who also comes to represent the society as a whole in her role as assistant attorney. And so by taking responsibility, by embodying the archetype of the warrior, Max is not only fighting for another individual, but for the good of society as a whole. He surprises to shadow warrior and this new found ability to take decisive action. Why? What are you going to do about it? But he also exposes the weakness and Vincent's character. Max ultimately does not win the final clash because of his competence with firearms or through his aggression, but by improvising on the spot. Whereas Vincent sticks to is rigid and pathological nature to sternum. When the head is inability to emotionally connect with others, and the one person who made himself conscious of is flawed nature ultimately become his downfall.

Speaker 3:          11:38          He stoically accepts death almost as part of his job and yet in his final words, we hear it a boy, so he broken men, a forgotten child. It's on the MTA. Hearing guys for Max life begins again. The repressed passive men who started the night is no more in display stands a writer with a ball in this net. He is not killed it for he knows it to be impossible, naive, immoral, and so yes, tamed his masculinity without becoming possessed by, by embodying his inner pool, not for chaos and destruction, but for the good of himself and those around him. He opens the door to a meaningful life, to an existence with purpose to a new beginning

Speaker 7:          12:30          is the cause. We have such a little experience of the positive side of this and where your mum that we become so cynical and sometimes even I listed about masculinity and begin to equate masculinity was patriarchy, which is very common and intellectual rounds today in my view. The two are not to be equated at all at all.
