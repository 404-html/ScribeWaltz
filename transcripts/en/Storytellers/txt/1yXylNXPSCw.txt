Speaker 1:          00:02          I think the dark nights racist will always be remembered as a film that just couldn't quite step out of the shadow of its predecessor. The dark nights, and I think we all know who's responsible for this.

Speaker 1:          00:15          Good evening, ladies and gentle man. We are tonight's entertainment. However, we can see the dark nights rises on its own not only as a good, if not excellent film births as a closure of the trilogy that's perfectly built upon and resource the inner struggle of Batman that has been built up within the previous films. To do this, however, we must first reject to political readings of the film that dominated for fuse and discussions on the dark knight rises. We do this by first exploring the ways in which Christopher Nolan constructs narratives and then showing the underlying psychological symbolism to which the personal story of the dark knight that's rices escape. There

Speaker 1:          01:10          now in many refuse and discussions of the dark knight rises the supposed political meaning of the film. What's a central topic I have discussed before, how in Juneau, many reviewers and pundits mistakenly focused on Juno supposed political message considering abortion and motherhood's a similar fate has befallen the dark knight rises Cosworth the reviewers and pundits clave that the dark knight rises also clear and it's important conservative message. According to them, the dark knight rises shows perfectly. The evil of leftist political revolution is beans for Toric, not the same as that of a Marxist revolutionary leader or even closer to home as death of the occupy Wall Street movement.

Speaker 2:          01:52          Take Gotham from dark car rock. Those are generations who have kept you down with myths of I'll put shoes on a team and we give it back to you. The people.

Speaker 1:          02:13          Roundup is yours. A sentencing trials. Now, the spires by the trials of the French Revolution as conservative pundits, Ben Shapiro states,

Speaker 3:          02:22          dark knight rises was probably not even meant to be a conservative movie. The entire movie is a diatribe about Marxism and the French revolution. I mean, there's including a full trial, seen a mock trial team. Uh, it's, it's fantastic.

Speaker 1:          02:33          Even more so. It is the police as representatives of order and establishment, the together with, well for Fuck Sake, a billionaire defend the city against this Marxist revolution of the people and who are higher of the ferry left progressive websites alone, even dare to call the Dark Knight Advices, a fascist movie stating the Mesas are the Philippines and the one time overlords are the heroes. Although some conservatives to celebrate Christopher Nolan as much need as conservative voice in Liberal Hollywood. He himself was surprised by these political interpretations of his film. He stated what was surprising to me is how many pundits booth right about the political interpretation of the film and not understand that any one political interpretation necessarily involve ignoring huge chunks of the film. Nolan argued death. He simply tried to expose tensions in society that somebody could exploit and that you can get falsely different political interpretations from the movie. Slash Boise Sec, for example, stated that there is very much a strange attraction and excitement in the film considering the idea of power to the people. He can see this for example in catwoman who so seductively whispers to our billionaire protagonist.

Speaker 2:          03:47          You think all this can last storm coming story when your friends better because you're all kind of wonder how you ever and leave. So

Speaker 1:          04:06          and the strange satisfaction we gets when Bain states who his employer,

Speaker 2:          04:21          this gives you,

Speaker 1:          04:23          Jesus concludes that the interpretation of the dark knight rises as conservative or Liberal, I have fewer sands for fewer assess more about them than about the film itself. Now I think by focusing so much on the political meaning of the film, we are not only missing the two team of the film, but we are also fundamentally missing how Christopher Nolan Constructs his narratives. The epidermis, the film supposed to conservative message can be seen in the final clash of the good guy police protectors of law and order to get her with Batman versus the Marxists proletariats less by bane

Speaker 2:          05:20          totally doors.

Speaker 1:          05:24          But then it turns out that the true pivotal scene of the film is the one that comes right off to this clash where it is revealed that a real villain and leader of the League of shadows is affect Miranda, Datto Frosto, ghoul

Speaker 2:          05:37          child Razia alcohol may decline. Then he's not the I and the lime not ordinary.

Speaker 1:          05:55          Such a plot twist is of course typical for Christopher Nolan. Famous force layered complicated narratives where nothing is but it seems. Now, Walter Ben Michael's has analyzed Nolan's narrative style and concluded that the key to notice plot twist is they're building towards the twist. The information to see the twist coming is already there.

Speaker 4:          06:17          Never show anyone, beg you, and they'll fly you for the secret, but as soon as you give it up, you'll be nothing to

Speaker 1:          06:25          he states for known as plot twists to be successful, the audience must deceive itself. Must refuse to see the obvious explanation for what is in front of it's very eyes. Nolan manipulates the audience desire to be mystified by what they see. So deathly effect when the hidden information is finally revealed, it's magnified indeed normalness called filmic narrative itself. The controlled release of information, Nolan often heights, the information in elaborate layers of narratives search as we can see in films like the Prestige Memento and inception. Now the narrative structure of the dark knight trilogy is more straight forward than that of these fills, but Nolan's plot twists and hidden information is still there. By rewatching the dark knight rises with the plot twist in mind, we can see that the film central team isn't a straight forward action hero clash off button and for us has been both a completion of betterment's own psychological struggle in the dark knight rises. We meet Bruce Wayne, not only in a horrible physical state, but also in a horrible psychological state. Still wallowing in the debt off Rachel and by extension his parents, he cannot leave Gotham and the Batman behind.

Speaker 4:          07:34          I did find so I know and you lost him, but that's all part of living sir, but you're not living. You're just waiting, hoping, but things to go bad. Again.

Speaker 1:          07:44          Nolan himself has set that gotten itself is a symbol for Bruce Wayne's psychological state. We can also find bruce ways, psychological struggle in the symbolic objects of his mother's necklace.

Speaker 4:          07:55          That's a beautiful necklace. Reminds me of one that belonged to my mother. Can't be the same

Speaker 1:          08:03          cause. Her pearls are in this safe, which is broken. Rushees shut in Batman begins, but now it's reassembled by bruce and kept in a safe before it got stolen by Serena Ak Catwoman. This necklace in the film contains a whole array off symbolic gesturing. We can see it in Bruce repairing the necklace, which is symbolic for trying to heal his wounds to keeping it in a safe as symbolic for trying to protect his wounded psych. This use of a safe as a symbol to protect one psych is of course also seen and one of nowness other films inception to bruce keeping us modest necklace. We can see that he can't let go of the past and a distress. Not a coincidence that the woman who takes the necklace away from it. It's also the woman who eventually is critical for Bruce being able to let go of this past.

Speaker 4:          08:53          Come with me. Save

Speaker 2:          08:56          yourself. You don't owe these people anymore. You've given them everything.

Speaker 1:          09:04          Now, upon second viewing, we know that the true feeling of the film is Miranda and she is very much parallel to Bruce Wayne's story, but Bruce Wayne and Batman begins Wallace for French, for a spouse. Death almost joined the League of shadows. Bird thank creates Batman. We run that. I had a similar faith where her mother was killed by criminals as a father by Bruce Wayne. Yes, she does. Joined the League of shadows.

Speaker 2:          09:33          Rick,

Speaker 1:          09:38          in this video on the joker, lessons from the screenplay explains the joker is an amazing antagonist because he exploits the weaknesses of the protagonists, Batman and that they both Bethel for the soft Gotham in the dark. Knight rises. This is build upon. We know that Beth man lost better for Gotham sold because it's Yoka turned hockey dance and that's a piece in Godson is built upon the lie, which Miranda through Bain exposes in the dark nights, Bruce Chooses Rachel A. Ball off. Harvey Dent who represents hopeful Gotham, but she's still dice.

Speaker 2:          10:11          All right. Listen some

Speaker 1:          10:16          me, Rhonda as a villain, dust users, bruises, weakest points, his loneliness, his heartbreak, and his desire to love a woman. Now, Miranda, his true identity is of course carefully hidden and therefore the central team of bruises, psychological battle is as well. Yes, upon rewatching the film, the information is always there. Offer plays an interesting role in this by stating his hope that bruce will leave, gotten Beth and his boss behaves to find happiness. He creates focus on the two central team of Boucher. Psychological journey.

Speaker 2:          10:45          I'll never one need you to come back to Gotham. I waste no, there was nothing here for you. Pain and tragedy and I wanted something more for you to know.

Speaker 1:          10:58          Yeah. It's by explaining pain as a dangerous villain to bruce offered helps tricking. The fewer into not seeing the two villain is Miranda

Speaker 4:          11:06          who's a member of the League of shadows and then he was actually indicating any man who is too extreme. The ratio. There's not that the, I didn't realize I was known for trifling criminals. That was Zane and you could just strap up your leg and put your mask back on.

Speaker 1:          11:28          Oh, Fred is the moral center of the trilogy, the Voice of Wisdom. And especially when in the dark nights he so beautifully explained, well it makes a joker tick. Some men just want to wash the world, but when he explains why Bain is so dangerous, we fully believe him. Even when we see Miranda suggests a fee using mosques. Ethan when the camera focuses on the scar on her back there, she got from the League of shadows and Ethan will be clear to see that the child or the escapes is a girl that even some of looks like Miranda and doesn't have to suppose scars, Death Bain receives in the pit because we believe all threats. We do not see it. Yeah. To information is there. The thematic resolution of the dark knight rises isn't Batman Wins. Spain loses this conservatism wins occupy losers because Bain isn't the coal antagonist of the film and if you don't see this, then we also missed the importance of the second twist of the film where we find out that that man is not death birth, indeed the life and that he did truly leave behind the Batman, Gotham and bane of his past.

Speaker 1:          12:29          The dark knight rises is not about a fiscally broken Beth man that rises out of the pit through defeat Bain. It's about Bruce Wayne who rises out of his psychological pain to leave the death of his parents. Rachel, the city of Carson and his persona as Batman truly behind.

Speaker 1:          13:14          Thank you all so much for watching. So first of all, thanks to scholar Benjamin and winter halter, whose paper, while some main inspiration for this video and also two lessons from the screenplay who gave me the ID to explore the last installment of the Dark Knight Trilogy. Further, it's going to be the joker, but there are certainly an important deeper theme in the last film death closest Bruce's journey. Follow us on facebook and twitter. And if you want access to more for work, you can support us on Patrion tomorrow for patrons. I will do another video where I talked loosely about the film as my essay. I will, for example, explore other symbolic gestures and explain why so many pundits and reviewers didn't see the underlying central team, but instead focused on the supposed political arc of better than the first has been for everyone else. See you next time.
