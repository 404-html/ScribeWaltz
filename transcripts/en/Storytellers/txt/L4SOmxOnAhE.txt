Speaker 1:          00:00          This video is sponsored by Fica Swath cleanse.

Speaker 2:          01:07          Why would you choose slide

Speaker 1:          01:09          one of the most iconic opening scenes instead of Danny Boyle's 90 96 movie, trainspotting in managers to take something that is unrelatable for most of us, the destructive and self destructive behavior of drug addicts and draws us in with a rationalization. We can all on the stands.

Speaker 2:          01:26          She was diy in one time. You the fuck you on a Sunday morning to sitting on the couch watching my numbing spit at Kachin game shorts, stuffing, fucking jumped for it and I chose not to choose life. I choose something else and the reasons, but I'm the reasons. These reasons when you've got hat on,

Speaker 1:          01:46          we are all aware of the mundanity, your flavor of [inaudible]. What can I get stuck in the boring daily responsibilities while it has to attend to choose cleaning your house too is doing Texas two is going through the same job every day from nine to five but why would you choose that? Why not just choose pleasure, especially if the pleasure.

Speaker 2:          02:07          Take the backstory guys, I'm you ever had multiply it by 2000 and there still are nowhere near it.

Speaker 1:          02:13          Rent and then his friends therefore find themselves in a similar position as I argued, similar dosing, the lion king, the position of choosing escapism that pleasure over adopting responsibility. Birth where Simba chooses eating bugs, relaxing and singing over reclaiming his kingdom rent and his friends to a darker and more destructive substance in order to escape the boring identity of normal, lower to middle class life. The film then exposes another hypocrisy about looking down on the heroin addiction

Speaker 2:          02:44          without poisoned my body. Whether I should. All the fucking chemicals move fucking weed. It's always the life mine. Is it in your body but shaped

Speaker 1:          03:00          cause own to all addicted to something. Does it really make any difference if we choose heroin or if you choose alcohol, violence or smoking? If we choose benching, television and movies, instagram or twitter,

Speaker 3:          03:13          choose facebook, twitter, snapchat, instagram and oppose and other ways to spew your bail cross. People you've never met. Choose updating your profile. Tell the world what you had for breakfast and hope that someone somewhere cares.

Speaker 1:          03:27          The answer to transplanting a guesthouse is that yes, it does make a difference cause just as rent and says,

Speaker 2:          03:33          this was to be my final head, but let's be clear by this. That's final pets and final heads

Speaker 1:          03:39          there. Our addictions and our addictions. Maybe you are all escaping something trying to fill a void because although good addiction can do that, the ones we choose, we will have an impact on our lives. There are addictions, there's will bring us up addictions that will bring us down slowly and addictions that he'll bring us down. False drove to film the pleasure of how to escape the boredom and identity and the harshness of life. Seeing strengthen, deepen hell almost destroying himself and everything around him. The ending of the film then leaves us with this message. It is better to choose to responsibility often normal mundane life than to seek further into the hell that escape displeasure creates.

Speaker 2:          04:21          Think I'm going to be just like you. The job family, the fucking big television, the washing machine, the car, the compact desk and electrical, 10 Elkanah, good health, low cholesterol, dental insurance, mortgage starter, home leisure wear, luggage, three piece, suite diy gave him shorts, junk food, children walks in the park, the nine to five good at goal washing the car choices,

Speaker 1:          04:50          but it is not the solution and this is what the secret of transporting tea two offers to me. What makes this film that was critiques for Wallowing in its own nostalgia. A brilliant film is that it's complete so question not fully answered by the original cause. What happens where you choose life when you choose getting away. We've tried to adopt your responsibilities and irritating that's comes with it when you moved from in the escape, his position to Waldorf adopting a normal Monday life where I will leave you 20 years later choose life, but as even bremmer a deck to play spot states. Life doesn't come for free. That will be beautiful moments, but it will also leave you scarred. The sequel explores this question is a good step to replace her addiction to heroin with an addiction to running and addiction to getting away good. It won't feel the void. What'd you channel on

Speaker 4:          05:47          getting away?

Speaker 1:          05:50          Choosing life will work out the way you hoped. Truest disappointment. Choose fill dreams filled and and answer the questions.

Speaker 3:          05:59          Settle for less and keep a brave face on it. Choose disappointment and choose losing the ones you love. Donuts. They fold from view a piece of you dies with them until you can see that one day in the future, piece by piece they will all be gone and there'll be nothing left of you to call alive or dead. Choose your future Veronica, choose life

Speaker 1:          06:19          and then it is time to return home and see what you left behind your heroin addiction. Yes, but maybe, maybe something more so what you been up to for 20 years cause maybe you miss something maybe within the hell threatens heroin, addiction, care, escapism. There was something more worth not music away from something else was choosing and death I think is the lesson. Trees. Putting explorers where we choose to be addicted to the moving forwards. We forget to look back and more importantly we forget to be where we are when there's nowhere to move forward to anymore renting us no choice but to look back and realize he mistakes, things that he didn't appreciate when he was experiencing the lesson in this nostalgic film. This film that is about one that's been well does be lost. Having this one on day,

Speaker 2:          07:20          sunny afternoon, two young minds up to Kevin for our very first hand offs. Warning. All right. Fresh bag. Your hand is that baby. Don't just choose your future. Choose to not choose to be present. Choose to experience the movies with your friends. Choose the lofter. Say, choose the one that got away. Choose to be tooth to sometimes that still listen to the user.
