1
00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:03.660
<v Speaker 1>Welcome back to six zero,</v>
<v Speaker 1>nine,</v>

2
00:00:03.670 --> 00:00:08.670
<v Speaker 1>nine artificial general intelligence.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Today we have Mark Graber.</v>

3
00:00:12.010 --> 00:00:16.720
<v Speaker 2>Thank you.</v>

4
00:00:16.790 --> 00:00:19.790
<v Speaker 1>He is the.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He really doesn't need an introduction,</v>

5
00:00:19.791 --> 00:00:21.200
<v Speaker 1>but we'll give him one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Anyway,</v>

6
00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:24.680
<v Speaker 1>he's the founder and CEO,</v>
<v Speaker 1>CEO of Boston Dynamics.</v>

7
00:00:24.770 --> 00:00:29.450
<v Speaker 1>He founded the Cmu leg lab in 1980,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the mit leg lab in 1986.</v>

8
00:00:29.690 --> 00:00:34.690
<v Speaker 1>Boston dynamics in 1992.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He and his team have developed some of </v>

9
00:00:34.690 --> 00:00:39.131
<v Speaker 1>the most amazing robots ever built,</v>
<v Speaker 1>including big dog atlas handle spots,</v>

10
00:00:39.551 --> 00:00:43.040
<v Speaker 1>spot many.</v>
<v Speaker 1>These robots move with the agility,</v>

11
00:00:43.041 --> 00:00:48.041
<v Speaker 1>dexterity,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and even grace that rivals and often </v>

12
00:00:48.041 --> 00:00:50.831
<v Speaker 1>supersedes that of human movement.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He continues to inspire us with what </v>

13
00:00:50.831 --> 00:00:55.220
<v Speaker 1>robots are capable of achieving in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>real world and what physical form future</v>

14
00:00:55.221 --> 00:00:59.360
<v Speaker 1>intelligence systems may take as they </v>
<v Speaker 1>become integrated in our daily lives.</v>

15
00:00:59.660 --> 00:01:02.090
<v Speaker 1>So please give a warm welcome.</v>

16
00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:07.390
<v Speaker 2>Thank you.</v>

17
00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:13.360
<v Speaker 3>This is our grand mission or aspiration,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is to make robots that are equal </v>

18
00:01:14.871 --> 00:01:19.220
<v Speaker 3>to or greater than a people in animals.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it's,</v>

19
00:01:19.221 --> 00:01:21.610
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's a daunting mission because a,</v>

20
00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:26.000
<v Speaker 3>we're so good at things.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It seems effortless.</v>

21
00:01:26.001 --> 00:01:27.410
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm standing here.</v>

22
00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:30.020
<v Speaker 3>No one questions that I could stand here</v>
<v Speaker 3>like this,</v>

23
00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:33.890
<v Speaker 3>but a lot's going on,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I can manipulate things,</v>

24
00:01:33.891 --> 00:01:38.891
<v Speaker 3>I can pick up this water,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I could reach in my pocket and use my </v>

25
00:01:38.891 --> 00:01:42.131
<v Speaker 3>hands with all the sensors in my hands </v>
<v Speaker 3>and coordinate that and maybe most of </v>

26
00:01:42.131 --> 00:01:44.030
<v Speaker 3>all our perception systems,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

27
00:01:44.031 --> 00:01:45.710
<v Speaker 3>there's audience has,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what is it,</v>

28
00:01:45.711 --> 00:01:50.711
<v Speaker 3>250 people in it or something.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I can look out there and see every </v>

29
00:01:50.711 --> 00:01:53.930
<v Speaker 3>one of you a stabilized in space even </v>
<v Speaker 3>while I'm moving.</v>

30
00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:56.180
<v Speaker 3>It's a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's just astounding.</v>

31
00:01:56.181 --> 00:01:56.760
<v Speaker 3>And the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

32
00:01:56.780 --> 00:02:00.470
<v Speaker 3>robots aren't there yet,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I think they can be.</v>

33
00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:03.590
<v Speaker 3>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>our goal is to keep chipping away,</v>

34
00:02:03.910 --> 00:02:05.240
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to try and get there.</v>

35
00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:10.780
<v Speaker 3>Before I get started,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I wanted to say that I got my start in </v>

36
00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:10.780
<v Speaker 3>robotics,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

37
00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:12.470
<v Speaker 3>here at Mit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was a graduate student.</v>

38
00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:17.740
<v Speaker 3>I was in the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what was then called the psychology </v>

39
00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:20.021
<v Speaker 3>department,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the brain and cognitive sciences </v>

40
00:02:20.021 --> 00:02:20.021
<v Speaker 3>department.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But I was taking an iap course just like</v>

41
00:02:20.021 --> 00:02:22.160
<v Speaker 3>you are.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it might've been a,</v>

42
00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:27.340
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>exactly this time of year when I </v>

43
00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:28.940
<v Speaker 3>followed one of my professor burt told </v>
<v Speaker 3>Horn back,</v>

44
00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:34.060
<v Speaker 3>I had,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was jabbering away at him asking him </v>

45
00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:35.120
<v Speaker 3>some questions about this or that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And we walked back to tech square,</v>

46
00:02:35.121 --> 00:02:37.190
<v Speaker 3>which is where the AI lab was in those </v>
<v Speaker 3>days.</v>

47
00:02:37.820 --> 00:02:42.820
<v Speaker 3>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we went up to the ninth floor and </v>

48
00:02:42.820 --> 00:02:43.700
<v Speaker 3>Russell Oscar,</v>
<v Speaker 3>who was a guy working in the lab,</v>

49
00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:47.060
<v Speaker 3>had an arm all taken apart on the table.</v>

50
00:02:47.210 --> 00:02:52.210
<v Speaker 3>It was like a thousand pieces.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I was a roboticist from that day on.</v>

51
00:02:53.270 --> 00:02:56.320
<v Speaker 3>I swear I didn't switch my major by,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

52
00:02:56.330 --> 00:02:58.430
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>got bertold to be an advisor.</v>

53
00:02:58.730 --> 00:03:03.550
<v Speaker 3>I found a topic that had to do with </v>
<v Speaker 3>robotics in that time.</v>

54
00:03:03.551 --> 00:03:06.760
<v Speaker 3>It was a manipulation thing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but eventually became legged,</v>

55
00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:07.690
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>thing.</v>

56
00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:09.700
<v Speaker 3>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was amazing,</v>

57
00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:10.970
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>

58
00:03:10.971 --> 00:03:12.730
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've never looked back.</v>

59
00:03:13.450 --> 00:03:14.290
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

60
00:03:14.291 --> 00:03:19.291
<v Speaker 3>here are some animals doing things that </v>
<v Speaker 3>are a very exciting climbing around on </v>

61
00:03:19.291 --> 00:03:22.960
<v Speaker 3>very rough terrain.</v>
<v Speaker 3>A very sure footed,</v>

62
00:03:23.230 --> 00:03:26.680
<v Speaker 3>using a mixture of their proprioception </v>
<v Speaker 3>and their vision.</v>

63
00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:31.920
<v Speaker 3>And look,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's even a baby that probably is </v>

64
00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:34.231
<v Speaker 3>only a couple of months old,</v>
<v Speaker 3>has no trouble at all doing these </v>

65
00:03:34.231 --> 00:03:38.281
<v Speaker 3>things.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And a look at the grace and suppleness </v>

66
00:03:38.290 --> 00:03:38.930
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

67
00:03:38.931 --> 00:03:41.200
<v Speaker 3>the fearlessness of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

68
00:03:41.201 --> 00:03:46.201
<v Speaker 3>of these animals.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's amazing here are animals running </v>

69
00:03:46.631 --> 00:03:48.720
<v Speaker 3>for their lives.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

70
00:03:48.820 --> 00:03:53.820
<v Speaker 3>the Gazelle is trying to stay alive for </v>
<v Speaker 3>the next 10 minutes and the cheetahs </v>

71
00:03:53.820 --> 00:03:56.440
<v Speaker 3>trying to get a meal so that it can stay</v>
<v Speaker 3>alive in general.</v>

72
00:04:00.130 --> 00:04:01.630
<v Speaker 3>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

73
00:04:01.631 --> 00:04:04.040
<v Speaker 3>even people can do things,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

74
00:04:04.090 --> 00:04:09.090
<v Speaker 3>that are breathtec.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I assume all of you were out this </v>

75
00:04:09.090 --> 00:04:11.520
<v Speaker 3>morning getting a little exercise,</v>
<v Speaker 3>climbing up the green building that </v>

76
00:04:11.520 --> 00:04:14.191
<v Speaker 3>we're in now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then maybe the other places around </v>

77
00:04:14.191 --> 00:04:14.191
<v Speaker 3>here.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's funny,</v>

78
00:04:14.191 --> 00:04:16.450
<v Speaker 3>I had bumped into some people when I </v>
<v Speaker 3>came into the room who were climbing the</v>

79
00:04:16.451 --> 00:04:19.000
<v Speaker 3>stairways,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think that were going on a trek up and</v>

80
00:04:19.001 --> 00:04:21.880
<v Speaker 3>down them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But I'd like to see the going outside.</v>

81
00:04:22.780 --> 00:04:25.270
<v Speaker 3>So probably most of you have seen this </v>
<v Speaker 3>video.</v>

82
00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:30.840
<v Speaker 3>This is a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is sort of where we were after </v>

83
00:04:30.840 --> 00:04:34.981
<v Speaker 3>about 10 years of work thing to make </v>
<v Speaker 3>machines that could work out in the real</v>

84
00:04:35.431 --> 00:04:40.431
<v Speaker 3>world that we're dynamically stabilize </v>
<v Speaker 3>dynamics is a big deal for our company </v>

85
00:04:40.980 --> 00:04:42.840
<v Speaker 3>and for what we do.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

86
00:04:42.841 --> 00:04:47.841
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>some active sensing and control and </v>

87
00:04:47.841 --> 00:04:49.340
<v Speaker 3>understanding of the physics.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

88
00:04:51.090 --> 00:04:53.910
<v Speaker 3>here's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this robot has all this control on board</v>

89
00:04:53.911 --> 00:04:58.911
<v Speaker 3>and it has reflexes and sensors and this</v>
<v Speaker 3>is an extension a to a thousand pound </v>

90
00:04:59.851 --> 00:05:03.030
<v Speaker 3>robot that could carry about 400 pounds </v>
<v Speaker 3>of payload.</v>

91
00:05:03.300 --> 00:05:05.070
<v Speaker 3>And we took it all around the United </v>
<v Speaker 3>States,</v>

92
00:05:05.071 --> 00:05:06.370
<v Speaker 3>testing it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

93
00:05:06.520 --> 00:05:08.940
<v Speaker 3>in various situations.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

94
00:05:09.270 --> 00:05:12.870
<v Speaker 3>here we have it in Virginia doing some </v>
<v Speaker 3>bushwhacking.</v>

95
00:05:13.110 --> 00:05:18.110
<v Speaker 3>It's actually following a person,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but the person is only in that have you </v>

96
00:05:18.110 --> 00:05:21.711
<v Speaker 3>intermittently.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it has to be able to keep track of </v>

97
00:05:21.711 --> 00:05:21.780
<v Speaker 3>where the person is and a deal with </v>
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>

98
00:05:21.990 --> 00:05:26.990
<v Speaker 3>And then back in good old Boston,</v>
<v Speaker 3>10 inches of snow just marches right up </v>

99
00:05:27.061 --> 00:05:27.660
<v Speaker 3>the hill.</v>

100
00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:31.290
<v Speaker 3>Here's the Cheetah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And now you know,</v>

101
00:05:31.291 --> 00:05:34.200
<v Speaker 3>mit has its own cheetah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is our cheetah.</v>

102
00:05:34.830 --> 00:05:37.440
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the people,</v>

103
00:05:37.441 --> 00:05:41.940
<v Speaker 3>no Song Bay who's doing the Mit Cheetah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

104
00:05:45.060 --> 00:05:50.060
<v Speaker 3>a very dynamic machine and basically an </v>
<v Speaker 3>experiment and seeing how fast we could </v>

105
00:05:50.060 --> 00:05:54.920
<v Speaker 3>make something like this run,</v>
<v Speaker 3>although you notice it's on a parking </v>

106
00:05:54.920 --> 00:05:55.800
<v Speaker 3>lot,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so it wasn't doing this on rough terrain</v>

107
00:05:56.130 --> 00:05:59.600
<v Speaker 3>and getting both efficiency and the </v>
<v Speaker 3>speed in,</v>

108
00:05:59.630 --> 00:06:04.630
<v Speaker 3>in the context of machine they'd also </v>
<v Speaker 3>can do rough terrain is a really big </v>

109
00:06:04.630 --> 00:06:08.741
<v Speaker 3>challenge that remains with us.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So this is just a snapshot of a most of </v>

110
00:06:11.271 --> 00:06:13.820
<v Speaker 3>the robots that we built at Boston </v>
<v Speaker 3>dynamics over the years.</v>

111
00:06:14.240 --> 00:06:19.240
<v Speaker 3>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not going to talk about most of </v>

112
00:06:19.240 --> 00:06:21.161
<v Speaker 3>them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm just going to talk about the last </v>

113
00:06:21.161 --> 00:06:21.161
<v Speaker 3>four.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

114
00:06:21.161 --> 00:06:23.360
<v Speaker 3>these are all robots that we developed </v>
<v Speaker 3>since we'd been part of Google,</v>

115
00:06:23.540 --> 00:06:25.160
<v Speaker 3>which has been the last four years.</v>

116
00:06:25.550 --> 00:06:30.550
<v Speaker 3>A spot many.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's a spot on the floor here which </v>

117
00:06:30.550 --> 00:06:31.460
<v Speaker 3>we'll demo the later spot.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Atlas,</v>

118
00:06:31.490 --> 00:06:36.490
<v Speaker 3>the humanoid.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Some of you may remember the humanoid </v>

119
00:06:36.490 --> 00:06:37.190
<v Speaker 3>that we used in the Darpa robotics </v>
<v Speaker 3>challenge.</v>

120
00:06:37.191 --> 00:06:40.130
<v Speaker 3>You have one here and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and then handle it,</v>

121
00:06:40.131 --> 00:06:45.131
<v Speaker 3>which is our latest version.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I'll say a few words to say about </v>

122
00:06:45.131 --> 00:06:48.371
<v Speaker 3>each of them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So we had been developing a big dog and </v>

123
00:06:48.561 --> 00:06:53.561
<v Speaker 3>those other quieter peds that I showed </v>
<v Speaker 3>you for quite some number of years and </v>

124
00:06:53.561 --> 00:06:57.251
<v Speaker 3>it was amazing for us to find out when </v>
<v Speaker 3>we did this project on a spot,</v>

125
00:06:57.410 --> 00:07:02.410
<v Speaker 3>this is the predecessor to that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that there was still a lot to learn and </v>

126
00:07:02.410 --> 00:07:06.641
<v Speaker 3>we kind of revolutionize the hardware </v>
<v Speaker 3>design and how the control worked and </v>

127
00:07:07.131 --> 00:07:10.760
<v Speaker 3>got a much higher level of rough terrain</v>
<v Speaker 3>performance.</v>

128
00:07:11.150 --> 00:07:15.890
<v Speaker 3>And part of the solution to that was to </v>
<v Speaker 3>be able to decompose the control problem</v>

129
00:07:16.160 --> 00:07:21.160
<v Speaker 3>into a many separate controllers that </v>
<v Speaker 3>operated in different regions of state </v>

130
00:07:21.471 --> 00:07:21.920
<v Speaker 3>space.</v>

131
00:07:22.320 --> 00:07:27.320
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and that allowed us both to have </v>

132
00:07:27.320 --> 00:07:27.650
<v Speaker 3>programmers work on multiple solutions </v>
<v Speaker 3>to the problem.</v>

133
00:07:28.100 --> 00:07:33.100
<v Speaker 3>I'm a and also have the complexity of </v>
<v Speaker 3>each controller is simplified by only </v>

134
00:07:34.701 --> 00:07:39.380
<v Speaker 3>having to operate in a small part of the</v>
<v Speaker 3>dynamic space here.</v>

135
00:07:39.381 --> 00:07:44.210
<v Speaker 3>We've added a robot arm to the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to the previous version of spot.</v>

136
00:07:44.680 --> 00:07:46.130
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and uh,</v>

137
00:07:46.420 --> 00:07:48.710
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we believe that mobile manipulation that</v>

138
00:07:48.711 --> 00:07:53.711
<v Speaker 3>is manipulation when you can move the </v>
<v Speaker 3>base is really a powerful,</v>

139
00:07:53.930 --> 00:07:56.570
<v Speaker 3>a way of doing things.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now,</v>

140
00:07:56.571 --> 00:08:01.571
<v Speaker 3>this is probably the most important </v>
<v Speaker 3>thing I want to show tonight and I'll </v>

141
00:08:01.571 --> 00:08:03.710
<v Speaker 3>show it three different times,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the idea that we don't build controllers</v>

142
00:08:03.711 --> 00:08:08.711
<v Speaker 3>that just do one particular thing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but that they can determine where they </v>

143
00:08:08.711 --> 00:08:10.160
<v Speaker 3>are in the execution,</v>
<v Speaker 3>here's another version of it,</v>

144
00:08:10.550 --> 00:08:15.550
<v Speaker 3>and then adjust what they're doing in </v>
<v Speaker 3>order to compensate for disturbances in </v>

145
00:08:15.951 --> 00:08:20.951
<v Speaker 3>the real world.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know this class is about ai and </v>

146
00:08:20.951 --> 00:08:20.951
<v Speaker 3>probably autonomy.</v>

147
00:08:22.610 --> 00:08:24.680
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think that the,</v>

148
00:08:24.980 --> 00:08:29.980
<v Speaker 3>one of the most important ways of </v>
<v Speaker 3>getting to autonomy is to have the low </v>

149
00:08:29.980 --> 00:08:33.821
<v Speaker 3>level implementation's very robust to </v>
<v Speaker 3>disturbances so that the planning steps </v>

150
00:08:33.821 --> 00:08:38.711
<v Speaker 3>don't have to take care of all the </v>
<v Speaker 3>minutia of the details of the real </v>

151
00:08:38.711 --> 00:08:42.821
<v Speaker 3>world.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that's what we've been trying to do </v>

152
00:08:42.821 --> 00:08:42.821
<v Speaker 3>there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

153
00:08:42.821 --> 00:08:45.800
<v Speaker 3>we've been experimenting with doing </v>
<v Speaker 3>delivery of packages to people's houses.</v>

154
00:08:46.190 --> 00:08:48.620
<v Speaker 3>These are all employees of Boston </v>
<v Speaker 3>dynamics,</v>

155
00:08:48.621 --> 00:08:51.800
<v Speaker 3>so we didn't go crashing a ordinary </v>
<v Speaker 3>people's houses.</v>

156
00:08:52.130 --> 00:08:53.030
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

157
00:08:53.240 --> 00:08:58.240
<v Speaker 3>it turns out that there's just lots of </v>
<v Speaker 3>different kinds of stairways and </v>

158
00:08:58.240 --> 00:08:59.310
<v Speaker 3>interests ways.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

159
00:08:59.520 --> 00:09:01.000
<v Speaker 3>and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

160
00:09:01.050 --> 00:09:06.050
<v Speaker 3>the robot's doing very well.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're up to something between 70 and 80 </v>

161
00:09:06.050 --> 00:09:06.690
<v Speaker 3>percent of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

162
00:09:06.990 --> 00:09:08.240
<v Speaker 3>of the kinds of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

163
00:09:08.460 --> 00:09:10.440
<v Speaker 3>stairs and access places we,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

164
00:09:10.560 --> 00:09:11.890
<v Speaker 3>encounter,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

165
00:09:12.240 --> 00:09:16.800
<v Speaker 3>after collecting data and making a </v>
<v Speaker 3>improvements and adjustments.</v>

166
00:09:20.160 --> 00:09:24.150
<v Speaker 3>So I'm going to say a few philosophical </v>
<v Speaker 3>things or approach things.</v>

167
00:09:24.660 --> 00:09:29.660
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a lot of people think that this is the </v>

168
00:09:29.660 --> 00:09:33.141
<v Speaker 3>model of how a computer and a robot </v>
<v Speaker 3>interact.</v>

169
00:09:33.660 --> 00:09:35.460
<v Speaker 3>That is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's the robot,</v>

170
00:09:35.980 --> 00:09:40.980
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is hardware and electronics and </v>

171
00:09:40.980 --> 00:09:40.980
<v Speaker 3>sensors and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

172
00:09:40.980 --> 00:09:43.140
<v Speaker 3>and then there's a computer and that the</v>
<v Speaker 3>computer,</v>

173
00:09:43.150 --> 00:09:47.520
<v Speaker 3>I'm listens to the sensors on the robot </v>
<v Speaker 3>and then gives it instructions and tells</v>

174
00:09:47.521 --> 00:09:52.521
<v Speaker 3>it what to do.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And while I think that's actually going </v>

175
00:09:52.521 --> 00:09:56.541
<v Speaker 3>on,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's another part to the story which </v>

176
00:09:56.541 --> 00:09:58.830
<v Speaker 3>is that the physical world is also </v>
<v Speaker 3>giving instructions to the robot.</v>

177
00:09:59.370 --> 00:10:02.850
<v Speaker 3>And that means that the energy's stored </v>
<v Speaker 3>in the robot,</v>

178
00:10:02.851 --> 00:10:05.580
<v Speaker 3>either in its springs or in.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a,</v>

179
00:10:05.950 --> 00:10:07.650
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's motion.</v>

180
00:10:07.950 --> 00:10:11.520
<v Speaker 3>Those are all important determinants of </v>
<v Speaker 3>how the robot is going to behave,</v>

181
00:10:11.690 --> 00:10:13.680
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in the time coming forward.</v>

182
00:10:14.220 --> 00:10:18.600
<v Speaker 3>And so we like to think in terms of </v>
<v Speaker 3>designing the hardware of the robot,</v>

183
00:10:18.870 --> 00:10:23.870
<v Speaker 3>the physical world,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and the computer all as one holistic </v>

184
00:10:23.870 --> 00:10:26.970
<v Speaker 3>thing where we take into account the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>those interactions.</v>

185
00:10:28.170 --> 00:10:30.550
<v Speaker 3>Sometimes we call this a harmony,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

186
00:10:30.551 --> 00:10:35.551
<v Speaker 3>a harmonic system is one usually where </v>
<v Speaker 3>you have energy oscillating back and </v>

187
00:10:35.551 --> 00:10:39.681
<v Speaker 3>forth.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Almost all legged locomotion has some </v>

188
00:10:39.681 --> 00:10:43.050
<v Speaker 3>amount of a harmony going on between </v>
<v Speaker 3>potential energy of elevation,</v>

189
00:10:43.290 --> 00:10:48.000
<v Speaker 3>potential energy of elastic deformation,</v>
<v Speaker 3>kinetic energy of motion,</v>

190
00:10:48.360 --> 00:10:49.390
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

191
00:10:49.530 --> 00:10:51.330
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>inverted pendulum things.</v>

192
00:10:51.331 --> 00:10:52.230
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and the like,</v>

193
00:10:53.880 --> 00:10:58.880
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>another part of our approach we call </v>

194
00:10:58.880 --> 00:10:58.880
<v Speaker 3>build it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>break it,</v>

195
00:10:58.880 --> 00:11:02.871
<v Speaker 3>fix it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now I have friends who build their </v>

196
00:11:02.871 --> 00:11:06.561
<v Speaker 3>robots and are so into the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the beauty of what they've created that </v>

197
00:11:08.761 --> 00:11:13.761
<v Speaker 3>they kind of put it on an altar and </v>
<v Speaker 3>afraid of actually hurting it.</v>

198
00:11:14.370 --> 00:11:15.360
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so,</v>

199
00:11:15.450 --> 00:11:16.200
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and in fact,</v>

200
00:11:16.201 --> 00:11:19.390
<v Speaker 3>I even have friends here at mit that </v>
<v Speaker 3>have done that where they have a goal,</v>

201
00:11:19.391 --> 00:11:22.890
<v Speaker 3>play that robot and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're afraid of taking it out into the</v>

202
00:11:22.891 --> 00:11:24.090
<v Speaker 3>world.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

203
00:11:24.091 --> 00:11:25.990
<v Speaker 3>we're just the opposite.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

204
00:11:26.030 --> 00:11:29.790
<v Speaker 3>every one of our robots is designed to </v>
<v Speaker 3>get bashed the bits.</v>

205
00:11:30.120 --> 00:11:34.200
<v Speaker 3>We have staff who are there to fix the </v>
<v Speaker 3>robot on a daily basis,</v>

206
00:11:34.350 --> 00:11:35.670
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>as we break it.</v>

207
00:11:35.910 --> 00:11:40.910
<v Speaker 3>And I think doing that build a break it </v>
<v Speaker 3>fix it means that we're able to learn a </v>

208
00:11:40.910 --> 00:11:44.890
<v Speaker 3>lot from the actual physical robot </v>
<v Speaker 3>working in the world and uh,</v>

209
00:11:44.940 --> 00:11:47.940
<v Speaker 3>we can use that knowledge in order to </v>
<v Speaker 3>improve the robot,</v>

210
00:11:47.941 --> 00:11:51.870
<v Speaker 3>improve it's behavior and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we really like to go around that loop as</v>

211
00:11:51.871 --> 00:11:56.871
<v Speaker 3>quickly and as we can early in the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in the process and do it as many times </v>

212
00:11:59.141 --> 00:12:01.900
<v Speaker 3>as we can.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So here's what build a break it fix.</v>

213
00:12:01.901 --> 00:12:06.901
<v Speaker 3>It looks like a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is in Somerville,</v>

214
00:12:13.330 --> 00:12:15.220
<v Speaker 3>our engineers.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is,</v>

215
00:12:15.221 --> 00:12:20.221
<v Speaker 3>I'm a Boston driver.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

216
00:12:27.631 --> 00:12:31.950
<v Speaker 3>This robot's supposed to be using his </v>
<v Speaker 3>visual system to avoid the trees.</v>

217
00:12:36.890 --> 00:12:38.900
<v Speaker 3>I think it might've fallen in love with </v>
<v Speaker 3>this tree.</v>

218
00:12:40.130 --> 00:12:41.990
<v Speaker 3>We don't purposely give them any </v>
<v Speaker 3>emotion,</v>

219
00:12:41.991 --> 00:12:44.720
<v Speaker 3>but boy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's hard not to see that.</v>

220
00:12:45.290 --> 00:12:49.700
<v Speaker 3>And here's the first time we tested the </v>
<v Speaker 3>pusher response to this robot.</v>

221
00:12:55.180 --> 00:12:57.280
<v Speaker 3>Did you hear that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's the new guy's car.</v>

222
00:12:57.281 --> 00:13:02.281
<v Speaker 3>So some guy who just started that week </v>
<v Speaker 3>trend a have $5,000,</v>

223
00:13:03.221 --> 00:13:04.660
<v Speaker 3>which we paid for,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

224
00:13:04.661 --> 00:13:07.930
<v Speaker 3>in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in repairs to his vintage BMW.</v>

225
00:13:10.270 --> 00:13:15.270
<v Speaker 3>So the last thing sort of about </v>
<v Speaker 3>philosophy is long term versus short </v>

226
00:13:15.270 --> 00:13:16.480
<v Speaker 3>term.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

227
00:13:16.481 --> 00:13:21.481
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>our company is 25 years old and we've </v>

228
00:13:21.481 --> 00:13:24.120
<v Speaker 3>mostly been a longterm a robotics </v>
<v Speaker 3>company that is,</v>

229
00:13:24.121 --> 00:13:29.121
<v Speaker 3>we're interested in moving the boundary </v>
<v Speaker 3>forward in what robots can do and we're </v>

230
00:13:29.911 --> 00:13:31.740
<v Speaker 3>interested in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

231
00:13:31.741 --> 00:13:36.450
<v Speaker 3>making it so robots meet the dream of </v>
<v Speaker 3>being the equal or better than people in</v>

232
00:13:36.451 --> 00:13:36.960
<v Speaker 3>animals.</v>

233
00:13:38.100 --> 00:13:43.100
<v Speaker 2>But now we've started function doesn't </v>
<v Speaker 2>break.</v>

234
00:13:53.780 --> 00:13:55.300
<v Speaker 3>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>got it.</v>

235
00:13:55.380 --> 00:13:57.350
<v Speaker 3>We still on.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Can you hear me?</v>

236
00:13:58.290 --> 00:14:01.150
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but uh,</v>

237
00:14:01.180 --> 00:14:06.180
<v Speaker 3>lately we've started to realize that </v>
<v Speaker 3>some of our robots have enough </v>

238
00:14:06.180 --> 00:14:10.020
<v Speaker 3>capability that maybe it's time to try </v>
<v Speaker 3>and productize them and we will learn a </v>

239
00:14:10.020 --> 00:14:11.320
<v Speaker 3>lot by doing that to.</v>
<v Speaker 3>One of the things,</v>

240
00:14:11.321 --> 00:14:14.340
<v Speaker 3>for instance,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that I've always claimed a,</v>

241
00:14:14.680 --> 00:14:19.680
<v Speaker 3>is that we always spent a lot of money </v>
<v Speaker 3>on building our robots in them and use </v>

242
00:14:20.561 --> 00:14:22.780
<v Speaker 3>that as a competitive advantage.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That is,</v>

243
00:14:22.960 --> 00:14:25.660
<v Speaker 3>Darpa was a frequent funder of us.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Darpa always said,</v>

244
00:14:25.661 --> 00:14:28.630
<v Speaker 3>let's take money out of the equation and</v>
<v Speaker 3>just figure out,</v>

245
00:14:28.870 --> 00:14:30.140
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

246
00:14:30.141 --> 00:14:35.141
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how to get the solution and then worry </v>

247
00:14:35.141 --> 00:14:37.160
<v Speaker 3>about getting the cost down later.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I always assumed and argued that once</v>

248
00:14:37.161 --> 00:14:39.200
<v Speaker 3>we get a robot doing things that are </v>
<v Speaker 3>interesting,</v>

249
00:14:39.350 --> 00:14:42.560
<v Speaker 3>then you can go and redesign it to make </v>
<v Speaker 3>it a lower cost.</v>

250
00:14:42.890 --> 00:14:47.890
<v Speaker 3>While we're going,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're going to test that because it </v>

251
00:14:47.890 --> 00:14:47.890
<v Speaker 3>might not be true.</v>

252
00:14:47.890 --> 00:14:50.110
<v Speaker 3>It might be that we've designed </v>
<v Speaker 3>ourselves into inexpensive coroner and,</v>

253
00:14:50.111 --> 00:14:51.500
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that it might be too late,</v>

254
00:14:51.860 --> 00:14:52.380
<v Speaker 3>but,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

255
00:14:52.400 --> 00:14:57.400
<v Speaker 3>the robot that will show in a little bit</v>
<v Speaker 3>is much significantly cost reduced from </v>

256
00:14:57.400 --> 00:15:01.571
<v Speaker 3>the prototype event.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it'll be interesting to see whether </v>

257
00:15:01.571 --> 00:15:03.770
<v Speaker 3>we could get it down to the kind of </v>
<v Speaker 3>prices that are useful.</v>

258
00:15:03.920 --> 00:15:08.920
<v Speaker 3>So this is just a picture again,</v>
<v Speaker 3>of the idea of aiming long but also </v>

259
00:15:09.201 --> 00:15:14.201
<v Speaker 3>aiming short and I think it's going to </v>
<v Speaker 3>be a challenge to see whether we can </v>

260
00:15:14.391 --> 00:15:18.620
<v Speaker 3>keep the culture of the company to </v>
<v Speaker 3>support both of these directions because</v>

261
00:15:18.770 --> 00:15:23.770
<v Speaker 3>people manufacturing stuff have a </v>
<v Speaker 3>different mindset than people trying to </v>

262
00:15:23.770 --> 00:15:26.540
<v Speaker 3>get out to the future horizons.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>

263
00:15:26.541 --> 00:15:31.541
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's gonna be a challenge to keep both </v>

264
00:15:31.541 --> 00:15:31.541
<v Speaker 3>those kinds of people are happy.</v>

265
00:15:34.400 --> 00:15:35.990
<v Speaker 3>Here's some of the things that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

266
00:15:36.140 --> 00:15:41.140
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>some of the kinds of applications you </v>

267
00:15:41.140 --> 00:15:41.140
<v Speaker 3>can look at,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

268
00:15:41.140 --> 00:15:41.720
<v Speaker 3>based on,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

269
00:15:41.780 --> 00:15:46.780
<v Speaker 3>modest,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a technical capabilities I've shown </v>

270
00:15:46.780 --> 00:15:48.770
<v Speaker 3>mobility and manipulation here,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you could put cost,</v>

271
00:15:48.771 --> 00:15:53.771
<v Speaker 3>reliability.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's many things that could be on </v>

272
00:15:53.771 --> 00:15:53.771
<v Speaker 3>these axes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

273
00:15:53.771 --> 00:15:57.491
<v Speaker 3>entertainment like robots and theme </v>
<v Speaker 3>parks is something that I think we </v>

274
00:15:57.491 --> 00:16:00.110
<v Speaker 3>should be able to do.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I already talked about home delivery.</v>

275
00:16:00.320 --> 00:16:05.320
<v Speaker 3>I think home delivery is waiting for </v>
<v Speaker 3>self driving cars to get all the way </v>

276
00:16:05.320 --> 00:16:06.560
<v Speaker 3>they are self driving trucks.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And once they do,</v>

277
00:16:06.740 --> 00:16:10.100
<v Speaker 3>then we will be working on getting it </v>
<v Speaker 3>from the truck to the,</v>

278
00:16:10.310 --> 00:16:12.350
<v Speaker 3>to the home.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

279
00:16:13.460 --> 00:16:15.070
<v Speaker 3>logistics,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

280
00:16:15.080 --> 00:16:20.080
<v Speaker 3>there's about a trillion boxes moved </v>
<v Speaker 3>every year around the world and most of </v>

281
00:16:21.111 --> 00:16:26.111
<v Speaker 3>it's done by hand.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so there's really a big opportunity </v>

282
00:16:26.111 --> 00:16:29.381
<v Speaker 3>to having robots help with moving those </v>
<v Speaker 3>trillion box's security,</v>

283
00:16:30.111 --> 00:16:32.190
<v Speaker 3>which could mean either commercial </v>
<v Speaker 3>security,</v>

284
00:16:32.191 --> 00:16:37.191
<v Speaker 3>like patrolling your shopping center or </v>
<v Speaker 3>the military type security,</v>

285
00:16:38.330 --> 00:16:39.380
<v Speaker 3>a construction.</v>

286
00:16:39.410 --> 00:16:43.370
<v Speaker 3>A lot of people have been coming to us </v>
<v Speaker 3>with their construction applications,</v>

287
00:16:43.770 --> 00:16:46.250
<v Speaker 3>a asking if we can help and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

288
00:16:46.251 --> 00:16:51.251
<v Speaker 3>I'm not going to talk about it now,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but if afterwards you want to ask about </v>

289
00:16:51.251 --> 00:16:51.251
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I can fill you in a little more.</v>

290
00:16:51.251 --> 00:16:55.310
<v Speaker 3>And I think this is really the ultimate,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a home run application,</v>

291
00:16:55.700 --> 00:16:59.630
<v Speaker 3>a care for the elderly and the disabled.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

292
00:17:00.440 --> 00:17:05.440
<v Speaker 3>I used to say that I wanted to have </v>
<v Speaker 3>robots that would help me take care of </v>

293
00:17:05.440 --> 00:17:05.840
<v Speaker 3>my,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

294
00:17:06.140 --> 00:17:08.960
<v Speaker 3>my parents and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

295
00:17:09.020 --> 00:17:14.020
<v Speaker 3>older people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But I realize now that it's probably </v>

296
00:17:14.020 --> 00:17:15.380
<v Speaker 3>going to be my children using them to </v>
<v Speaker 3>help take care of me.</v>

297
00:17:15.620 --> 00:17:20.620
<v Speaker 3>But you guys are,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're all a little bit younger and I </v>

298
00:17:20.620 --> 00:17:20.620
<v Speaker 3>think,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

299
00:17:20.620 --> 00:17:22.190
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there'll be a time when,</v>

300
00:17:22.191 --> 00:17:27.191
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you could use robots to help make your </v>

301
00:17:27.191 --> 00:17:27.191
<v Speaker 3>parents' lives better.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now,</v>

302
00:17:27.191 --> 00:17:29.090
<v Speaker 3>some of you may think that your parents </v>
<v Speaker 3>don't want that,</v>

303
00:17:29.450 --> 00:17:29.830
<v Speaker 3>but,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

304
00:17:29.840 --> 00:17:31.490
<v Speaker 3>I think it's a complex question.</v>

305
00:17:31.670 --> 00:17:34.560
<v Speaker 3>We've seen some surveys that say that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

306
00:17:34.610 --> 00:17:39.610
<v Speaker 3>people aren't totally happy with the </v>
<v Speaker 3>idea of their kids taking care of them </v>

307
00:17:39.610 --> 00:17:40.490
<v Speaker 3>on a moment by moment basis.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>

308
00:17:40.491 --> 00:17:45.491
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think there's going to be an </v>

309
00:17:45.491 --> 00:17:46.391
<v Speaker 3>opportunity for doing something,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but technically this is still a ways </v>

310
00:17:46.391 --> 00:17:46.391
<v Speaker 3>off.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>

311
00:17:46.391 --> 00:17:46.760
<v Speaker 3>it's a tough thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay,</v>

312
00:17:46.761 --> 00:17:48.920
<v Speaker 3>let's get back to the robots.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

313
00:17:49.020 --> 00:17:54.020
<v Speaker 3>spot mini is a robot that weighs about </v>
<v Speaker 3>60 pounds that previous spot weight </v>

314
00:17:54.271 --> 00:17:57.420
<v Speaker 3>about 180 pounds.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This one weighs about 60 pounds.</v>

315
00:17:57.890 --> 00:18:00.090
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and uh,</v>

316
00:18:00.120 --> 00:18:05.120
<v Speaker 3>here's some anatomy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's got an arm with a five degrees of </v>

317
00:18:05.120 --> 00:18:06.720
<v Speaker 3>freedom.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Each leg has three degrees of freedom.</v>

318
00:18:09.680 --> 00:18:14.680
<v Speaker 3>It's got about a 500 watt hour battery </v>
<v Speaker 3>batteries for these things are </v>

319
00:18:15.290 --> 00:18:17.120
<v Speaker 3>challenged because,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

320
00:18:17.121 --> 00:18:22.121
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can have consumer products like </v>

321
00:18:22.121 --> 00:18:22.490
<v Speaker 3>electric drills that have relatively </v>
<v Speaker 3>small batteries.</v>

322
00:18:22.640 --> 00:18:27.640
<v Speaker 3>And then there's electric cars that had </v>
<v Speaker 3>big batteries and there's not really </v>

323
00:18:27.640 --> 00:18:30.611
<v Speaker 3>much available in between.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So we've done a lot of work on the </v>

324
00:18:30.611 --> 00:18:32.981
<v Speaker 3>battery technology for these things to </v>
<v Speaker 3>make the safe and reliable and hot </v>

325
00:18:32.981 --> 00:18:34.450
<v Speaker 3>swappable and things like that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

326
00:18:34.830 --> 00:18:37.550
<v Speaker 3>then there's radios and computers.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

327
00:18:37.730 --> 00:18:40.170
<v Speaker 3>the previous version had three quad </v>
<v Speaker 3>core,</v>

328
00:18:40.680 --> 00:18:42.740
<v Speaker 3>I seven [inaudible].</v>
<v Speaker 3>This one has two.</v>

329
00:18:43.010 --> 00:18:48.010
<v Speaker 3>We're trying to cut back on the cost and</v>
<v Speaker 3>then there can be some sensors,</v>

330
00:18:50.030 --> 00:18:55.030
<v Speaker 3>lidars stereo and the like.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So you can see spot man,</v>

331
00:18:58.131 --> 00:18:59.940
<v Speaker 3>he's a little bit smaller than spot.</v>

332
00:19:05.540 --> 00:19:06.170
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

333
00:19:06.700 --> 00:19:09.280
<v Speaker 3>this isn't a real house and those aren't</v>
<v Speaker 3>real people.</v>

334
00:19:09.281 --> 00:19:11.040
<v Speaker 3>Those are engineers.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

335
00:19:12.220 --> 00:19:17.220
<v Speaker 3>this is a inside of a warehouse we have </v>
<v Speaker 3>out on one slash 28 where we've built </v>

336
00:19:17.220 --> 00:19:18.610
<v Speaker 3>the house.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can see that they don't,</v>

337
00:19:18.611 --> 00:19:23.611
<v Speaker 3>we don't mind scuffing up the walls here</v>
<v Speaker 3>and there is a lot of scuffing that </v>

338
00:19:23.611 --> 00:19:26.491
<v Speaker 3>happens.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Some of you may recognize active Koski </v>

339
00:19:26.491 --> 00:19:26.491
<v Speaker 3>who is a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

340
00:19:26.491 --> 00:19:29.760
<v Speaker 3>an mit alum and he's again disturbing </v>
<v Speaker 3>the robot here,</v>

341
00:19:29.770 --> 00:19:34.770
<v Speaker 3>the robots using its vision to do some </v>
<v Speaker 3>stepping stone type operations.</v>

342
00:19:35.290 --> 00:19:40.290
<v Speaker 3>And I think gene is going to talk a </v>
<v Speaker 3>little bit more about this in a couple </v>

343
00:19:40.290 --> 00:19:43.051
<v Speaker 3>of minutes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And here's a case where it's doing </v>

344
00:19:43.051 --> 00:19:45.040
<v Speaker 3>stepping stones on real stones and it's </v>
<v Speaker 3>keeping its balance,</v>

345
00:19:45.070 --> 00:19:47.570
<v Speaker 3>figuring out where to put the feet.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

346
00:19:50.670 --> 00:19:55.670
<v Speaker 3>and again,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this robot only has stereo looking out </v>

347
00:19:55.670 --> 00:19:58.281
<v Speaker 3>the front,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whereas this one has a stereo on all </v>

348
00:19:58.281 --> 00:19:58.281
<v Speaker 3>four sides.</v>

349
00:20:03.740 --> 00:20:08.740
<v Speaker 3>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 3>one of the cool things about animals is </v>

350
00:20:08.740 --> 00:20:09.140
<v Speaker 3>that they have these stabilization </v>
<v Speaker 3>mechanisms for their sensors.</v>

351
00:20:09.141 --> 00:20:14.141
<v Speaker 3>That was a real chicken,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no robotics involved and here's our </v>

352
00:20:14.141 --> 00:20:17.810
<v Speaker 3>attempt to show that these,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this robot can do the same sort of thing</v>

353
00:20:19.020 --> 00:20:21.380
<v Speaker 3>and if you think about it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when you're manipulating,</v>

354
00:20:21.381 --> 00:20:26.381
<v Speaker 3>you really want the hand to be </v>
<v Speaker 3>stabilized in space and so you'd like </v>

355
00:20:26.381 --> 00:20:29.891
<v Speaker 3>the body to be able to kind of </v>
<v Speaker 3>coordinate with the hands so that you </v>

356
00:20:29.891 --> 00:20:32.920
<v Speaker 3>can concentrate on what the world real </v>
<v Speaker 3>world task is.</v>

357
00:20:33.580 --> 00:20:38.580
<v Speaker 3>A man,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you guys didn't pick up the banana </v>

358
00:20:38.580 --> 00:20:38.580
<v Speaker 3>peels,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Huh?</v>

359
00:20:49.860 --> 00:20:53.910
<v Speaker 3>So our concept for the spot many product</v>
<v Speaker 3>is to make a platform.</v>

360
00:20:54.210 --> 00:20:57.330
<v Speaker 3>It's sort of the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're thinking of it like the android of</v>

361
00:20:57.331 --> 00:21:02.331
<v Speaker 3>robots.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So with android there's a hardware </v>

362
00:21:02.331 --> 00:21:04.971
<v Speaker 3>platform and then there's a software </v>
<v Speaker 3>platform and then a developer's third </v>

363
00:21:06.151 --> 00:21:09.750
<v Speaker 3>party developers create their own apps </v>
<v Speaker 3>that use the platform.</v>

364
00:21:10.110 --> 00:21:15.110
<v Speaker 3>So we've made this spot so that there's </v>
<v Speaker 3>a place to mount hardware on the robot,</v>

365
00:21:16.530 --> 00:21:19.110
<v Speaker 3>but there's also an API to program it </v>
<v Speaker 3>through.</v>

366
00:21:19.380 --> 00:21:24.380
<v Speaker 3>And then there's a facility to have </v>
<v Speaker 3>additional computing external to the </v>

367
00:21:24.380 --> 00:21:28.670
<v Speaker 3>robot.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And we're working with third parties to </v>

368
00:21:28.670 --> 00:21:30.570
<v Speaker 3>develop their own applications that run </v>
<v Speaker 3>on the platform.</v>

369
00:21:34.780 --> 00:21:35.250
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

370
00:21:35.720 --> 00:21:37.760
<v Speaker 3>this is a video that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

371
00:21:37.761 --> 00:21:39.830
<v Speaker 3>we haven't been able to release </v>
<v Speaker 3>publicly.</v>

372
00:21:39.890 --> 00:21:42.200
<v Speaker 3>Please don't tape it and show it,</v>

373
00:21:42.480 --> 00:21:43.030
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

374
00:21:44.040 --> 00:21:49.040
<v Speaker 3>because I can't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'll explain later if you want to know </v>

375
00:21:49.040 --> 00:21:51.531
<v Speaker 3>why not,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but this is just a revealing that we do </v>

376
00:21:51.531 --> 00:21:51.810
<v Speaker 3>have an arm on the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>on the new version of spot.</v>

377
00:21:54.580 --> 00:21:56.680
<v Speaker 3>It's using a camera in the hand to find </v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

378
00:21:56.730 --> 00:22:01.730
<v Speaker 3>the door handle.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This robot doesn't weigh a lot,</v>

379
00:22:03.971 --> 00:22:06.670
<v Speaker 3>so it has to use tricks to keep the door</v>
<v Speaker 3>open.</v>

380
00:22:06.760 --> 00:22:08.350
<v Speaker 3>So that's why he puts his foot in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>door.</v>

381
00:22:20.580 --> 00:22:22.730
<v Speaker 3>And here again,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we want to show that the,</v>

382
00:22:22.950 --> 00:22:26.580
<v Speaker 3>we've made the solution robust to </v>
<v Speaker 3>certain kinds of disturbances.</v>

383
00:22:26.820 --> 00:22:28.140
<v Speaker 3>So Andy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there,</v>

384
00:22:28.200 --> 00:22:31.220
<v Speaker 3>andy sitting over here is a pushing on </v>
<v Speaker 3>the door,</v>

385
00:22:31.230 --> 00:22:35.220
<v Speaker 3>pushing on the hand.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The robot keeps track of how far,</v>

386
00:22:35.250 --> 00:22:38.040
<v Speaker 3>how much progress it's made in doing its</v>
<v Speaker 3>task.</v>

387
00:22:45.770 --> 00:22:48.170
<v Speaker 3>It's so,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's so smart and even kicks that,</v>

388
00:22:48.171 --> 00:22:49.950
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that shell out of the way.</v>

389
00:22:49.951 --> 00:22:54.951
<v Speaker 3>Now that was total accident and now it's</v>
<v Speaker 3>just gone back to try again.</v>

390
00:23:02.560 --> 00:23:03.130
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

391
00:23:05.300 --> 00:23:07.700
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and then this is a demo of autonomy.</v>

392
00:23:08.160 --> 00:23:10.820
<v Speaker 3>A here are,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the robot has a,</v>

393
00:23:11.180 --> 00:23:14.810
<v Speaker 3>in a previous session,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we've taken it around the lab.</v>

394
00:23:14.811 --> 00:23:19.811
<v Speaker 3>This is Boston dynamics take into the </v>
<v Speaker 3>realm of lab and recorded visual data </v>

395
00:23:19.811 --> 00:23:24.760
<v Speaker 3>that can be used for navigation and it's</v>
<v Speaker 3>using its stereo to match up features in</v>

396
00:23:25.101 --> 00:23:28.730
<v Speaker 3>the environment so that they can </v>
<v Speaker 3>navigate a Ngo,</v>

397
00:23:29.000 --> 00:23:31.010
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>where it had gone in the previous,</v>

398
00:23:31.050 --> 00:23:33.260
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>on the previous path.</v>

399
00:23:33.261 --> 00:23:36.070
<v Speaker 3>So there's no one driving it for this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's all a,</v>

400
00:23:36.410 --> 00:23:41.410
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>autonomous that was outside my office </v>

401
00:23:42.240 --> 00:23:45.030
<v Speaker 3>every day around noon.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The robot seems to show,</v>

402
00:23:45.500 --> 00:23:47.000
<v Speaker 3>and I hear it pausing out there,</v>

403
00:23:51.490 --> 00:23:56.490
<v Speaker 3>I don't know why it turned there as </v>
<v Speaker 3>sometimes it comes up with a solution </v>

404
00:23:56.490 --> 00:24:00.151
<v Speaker 3>that isn't in here.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You'll see another one that comes up </v>

405
00:24:00.151 --> 00:24:00.151
<v Speaker 3>with a solution that isn't cool,</v>
<v Speaker 3>why,</v>

406
00:24:00.790 --> 00:24:04.320
<v Speaker 3>what call is an optimization,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it does,</v>

407
00:24:04.321 --> 00:24:06.300
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it does get a solution.</v>

408
00:24:07.440 --> 00:24:12.440
<v Speaker 3>So we're pretty excited by this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We call this patrol route and we're </v>

409
00:24:12.440 --> 00:24:13.620
<v Speaker 3>working on developing a lot of software </v>
<v Speaker 3>to support it,</v>

410
00:24:13.740 --> 00:24:18.740
<v Speaker 3>to make it so that other people can </v>
<v Speaker 3>capture a patrol route and then execute </v>

411
00:24:18.931 --> 00:24:20.790
<v Speaker 3>them on a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>on a routine basis,</v>

412
00:24:20.940 --> 00:24:23.310
<v Speaker 3>and then do the other tasks while </v>
<v Speaker 3>they're on the,</v>

413
00:24:23.610 --> 00:24:27.840
<v Speaker 3>on the patrol route.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Seth,</v>

414
00:24:28.040 --> 00:24:33.040
<v Speaker 3>you're on.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So we're now we'll do a demo of a spot </v>

415
00:24:33.040 --> 00:24:36.661
<v Speaker 3>mini.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So for this,</v>

416
00:24:41.420 --> 00:24:43.580
<v Speaker 3>for this demo,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Seth Scott,</v>

417
00:24:43.581 --> 00:24:48.581
<v Speaker 3>a joystick and he's telling it the speed</v>
<v Speaker 3>to go in the forward direction and </v>

418
00:24:49.491 --> 00:24:52.610
<v Speaker 3>turning,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but the robots doing all its own,</v>

419
00:24:53.080 --> 00:24:54.650
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>gates selection,</v>

420
00:24:55.310 --> 00:25:00.310
<v Speaker 3>coordination of legs,</v>
<v Speaker 3>balance obviously.</v>

421
00:25:02.270 --> 00:25:07.270
<v Speaker 3>So the robot has a bunch of different </v>
<v Speaker 3>gates that can walk here.</v>

422
00:25:07.660 --> 00:25:10.860
<v Speaker 3>It's doing one leg at a time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

423
00:25:12.430 --> 00:25:16.130
<v Speaker 3>it can try it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know you do whatever gets you on set.</v>

424
00:25:19.760 --> 00:25:22.970
<v Speaker 3>He's got to use the selected yet.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So here's trotting,</v>

425
00:25:23.240 --> 00:25:26.220
<v Speaker 3>which is diagonal pairs of legs.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

426
00:25:26.240 --> 00:25:31.240
<v Speaker 3>it can do pacing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is lateral pairs of legs to get </v>

427
00:25:31.240 --> 00:25:31.580
<v Speaker 3>working together.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I have to tell you,</v>

428
00:25:32.210 --> 00:25:35.300
<v Speaker 3>in the earliest days of me being </v>
<v Speaker 3>involved in legged locomotion,</v>

429
00:25:35.600 --> 00:25:39.890
<v Speaker 3>I thought gate was a big deal,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's really kind of a small thing.</v>

430
00:25:40.300 --> 00:25:45.300
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I don't think it's central to what </v>

431
00:25:45.300 --> 00:25:45.300
<v Speaker 3>matters,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is support,</v>

432
00:25:45.300 --> 00:25:46.910
<v Speaker 3>stability,</v>
<v Speaker 3>propulsion,</v>

433
00:25:47.270 --> 00:25:50.120
<v Speaker 3>and things like that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to wrap up shortly.</v>

434
00:25:50.121 --> 00:25:54.230
<v Speaker 3>I just thought I'd say a couple of words</v>
<v Speaker 3>about the mechanical side.</v>

435
00:25:54.460 --> 00:25:55.950
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

436
00:25:55.960 --> 00:25:59.090
<v Speaker 3>the atlas is a new version of a </v>
<v Speaker 3>humanoid.</v>

437
00:25:59.480 --> 00:26:01.460
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know some of you worked with the Darpa</v>

438
00:26:01.461 --> 00:26:02.870
<v Speaker 3>robotics challenge,</v>
<v Speaker 3>humanoid,</v>

439
00:26:03.140 --> 00:26:08.140
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which was a big hulking thing that we </v>

440
00:26:08.140 --> 00:26:10.421
<v Speaker 3>made and this is a much more svelte one.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And the way we got there was to uh,</v>

441
00:26:12.080 --> 00:26:14.000
<v Speaker 3>work on,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

442
00:26:14.880 --> 00:26:19.880
<v Speaker 3>the elements of the mechanical design to</v>
<v Speaker 3>take advantage of three d printing and,</v>

443
00:26:21.021 --> 00:26:22.070
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

444
00:26:22.100 --> 00:26:23.300
<v Speaker 3>some optimization.</v>

445
00:26:23.600 --> 00:26:28.600
<v Speaker 3>And we did,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we focused on two or three different </v>

446
00:26:28.600 --> 00:26:31.061
<v Speaker 3>things.</v>
<v Speaker 3>One is making some of the leg parts </v>

447
00:26:31.061 --> 00:26:33.470
<v Speaker 3>where we embed hydraulic pathways,</v>
<v Speaker 3>hydraulic actuators,</v>

448
00:26:33.830 --> 00:26:37.310
<v Speaker 3>places for valve mounts and filters and </v>
<v Speaker 3>things like that into the leg.</v>

449
00:26:37.520 --> 00:26:42.520
<v Speaker 3>And this is what that looks like.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's a single upper leg part that </v>

450
00:26:42.520 --> 00:26:47.441
<v Speaker 3>incorporated 15 or 20 different separate</v>
<v Speaker 3>components in the previous design which </v>

451
00:26:48.091 --> 00:26:49.710
<v Speaker 3>made it lighter,</v>
<v Speaker 3>more compact,</v>

452
00:26:50.130 --> 00:26:55.130
<v Speaker 3>and a higher strength to weight ratio.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We also developed a hydraulic power </v>

453
00:26:55.951 --> 00:27:00.570
<v Speaker 3>unit,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which takes many components.</v>

454
00:27:00.600 --> 00:27:05.600
<v Speaker 3>The thing on the left are the components</v>
<v Speaker 3>as separate ones and we were able to </v>

455
00:27:06.181 --> 00:27:11.181
<v Speaker 3>print parts that integrated them so that</v>
<v Speaker 3>there was a motor or a pump inside of a </v>

456
00:27:11.461 --> 00:27:13.560
<v Speaker 3>motor,</v>
<v Speaker 3>an accumulator,</v>

457
00:27:13.610 --> 00:27:15.690
<v Speaker 3>a reservoir,</v>
<v Speaker 3>valves,</v>

458
00:27:15.691 --> 00:27:20.691
<v Speaker 3>filters and those things,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and we shrunk it down so that the robot </v>

459
00:27:20.691 --> 00:27:25.230
<v Speaker 3>could be smaller and lighter.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And using that approach,</v>

460
00:27:25.231 --> 00:27:30.231
<v Speaker 3>we went from about a 375 pound DRC robot</v>
<v Speaker 3>to a one 90 pound robot.</v>

461
00:27:31.890 --> 00:27:34.890
<v Speaker 3>And then the current one is about a </v>
<v Speaker 3>hundred and 65 pounds.</v>

462
00:27:35.550 --> 00:27:40.550
<v Speaker 3>Now this picture might lead you to </v>
<v Speaker 3>believe that I'm advertising myself as </v>

463
00:27:40.550 --> 00:27:43.890
<v Speaker 3>only weighing 165 pounds.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And unfortunately that's not true,</v>

464
00:27:44.040 --> 00:27:49.040
<v Speaker 3>but I'm working on it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it is close to my size and weight.</v>

465
00:27:50.430 --> 00:27:51.150
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

466
00:27:51.151 --> 00:27:56.151
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't think we have this out as a </v>

467
00:27:56.151 --> 00:27:56.151
<v Speaker 3>video.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Here's,</v>

468
00:27:56.151 --> 00:27:56.190
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

469
00:27:56.220 --> 00:28:01.220
<v Speaker 3>some,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a robot behavior that uses whole body </v>

470
00:28:01.220 --> 00:28:04.170
<v Speaker 3>motion,</v>
<v Speaker 3>meaning the mobility based plus the arms</v>

471
00:28:04.171 --> 00:28:07.560
<v Speaker 3>plus the torso or all combining in order</v>
<v Speaker 3>to handle these,</v>

472
00:28:07.561 --> 00:28:08.970
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>these boxes.</v>

473
00:28:08.971 --> 00:28:13.971
<v Speaker 3>It's using vision with the qr codes to </v>
<v Speaker 3>simplify the task here we're trying to </v>

474
00:28:13.971 --> 00:28:18.471
<v Speaker 3>go at human speeds of operation.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so the robot searches for a box </v>

475
00:28:18.870 --> 00:28:19.890
<v Speaker 3>using its vision.</v>

476
00:28:25.110 --> 00:28:30.110
<v Speaker 3>I think that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think that was the only take we ever </v>

477
00:28:30.110 --> 00:28:33.291
<v Speaker 3>got with both robots working together </v>
<v Speaker 3>and uh,</v>

478
00:28:35.280 --> 00:28:40.280
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>one of the problems with youtube as </v>

479
00:28:40.280 --> 00:28:40.280
<v Speaker 3>everybody's already seen what you've </v>
<v Speaker 3>been up to by the time you get it,</v>

480
00:28:40.280 --> 00:28:42.750
<v Speaker 3>go around to give a talk.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I imagine most of you have seen this,</v>

481
00:28:43.200 --> 00:28:43.960
<v Speaker 3>but,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

482
00:28:44.220 --> 00:28:48.240
<v Speaker 3>here's a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a par core robot we're working on where,</v>

483
00:28:48.241 --> 00:28:53.241
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we've actually strengthened the hips so </v>

484
00:28:53.241 --> 00:28:53.241
<v Speaker 3>that it can do a little bit more jumping</v>
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>

485
00:28:53.241 --> 00:28:54.660
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

486
00:29:04.740 --> 00:29:05.580
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

487
00:29:07.260 --> 00:29:12.260
<v Speaker 3>it's kind of interesting that we,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we've been interested in making a robot </v>

488
00:29:12.260 --> 00:29:14.070
<v Speaker 3>a little bit like the humanoid that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

489
00:29:14.100 --> 00:29:16.770
<v Speaker 3>has less degrees of freedom,</v>
<v Speaker 3>fewer degrees of freedom,</v>

490
00:29:16.771 --> 00:29:21.771
<v Speaker 3>and a simpler.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And we designed this robot and the </v>

491
00:29:21.771 --> 00:29:22.920
<v Speaker 3>ultimate version of this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we'll have about 10 joints,</v>

492
00:29:22.921 --> 00:29:26.850
<v Speaker 3>whereas the humanoid had 28 and have </v>
<v Speaker 3>many,</v>

493
00:29:26.880 --> 00:29:30.040
<v Speaker 3>many of the same capabilities.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

494
00:29:31.350 --> 00:29:32.650
<v Speaker 3>we have,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

495
00:29:32.700 --> 00:29:35.460
<v Speaker 3>some use cases for this that I'm not </v>
<v Speaker 3>going to talk about today.</v>

496
00:29:35.820 --> 00:29:36.600
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but,</v>

497
00:29:36.601 --> 00:29:38.670
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this robot can lift heavy loads.</v>

498
00:29:39.030 --> 00:29:41.410
<v Speaker 3>It has a relatively small footprint </v>
<v Speaker 3>given,</v>

499
00:29:41.650 --> 00:29:43.090
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what his strength is.</v>

500
00:29:43.360 --> 00:29:48.360
<v Speaker 3>So the way things are done in logistics </v>
<v Speaker 3>now is to use big robot arms that take </v>

501
00:29:49.241 --> 00:29:51.940
<v Speaker 3>up a lot of floor area or heavy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

502
00:29:52.000 --> 00:29:57.000
<v Speaker 3>and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're looking at ways of using a robot </v>

503
00:29:57.000 --> 00:29:57.070
<v Speaker 3>like this one,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not exactly this,</v>

504
00:29:57.071 --> 00:29:59.410
<v Speaker 3>we,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's sort of an evolution of this design</v>

505
00:30:00.070 --> 00:30:02.590
<v Speaker 3>in order to do logistics operations.</v>

506
00:30:05.490 --> 00:30:09.300
<v Speaker 3>So I want to make a pitch to you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>A Boston dynamics is hiring,</v>

507
00:30:09.900 --> 00:30:11.150
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and uh,</v>

508
00:30:11.151 --> 00:30:13.380
<v Speaker 3>I hope some of you will apply for a job </v>
<v Speaker 3>there.</v>

509
00:30:13.710 --> 00:30:16.150
<v Speaker 3>These are how many years?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It,</v>

510
00:30:16.380 --> 00:30:19.280
<v Speaker 3>six times three.</v>
<v Speaker 3>These are 18,</v>

511
00:30:19.660 --> 00:30:24.660
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>mit alum that currently work at the </v>

512
00:30:24.660 --> 00:30:25.200
<v Speaker 3>company,</v>
<v Speaker 3>many of them for many years.</v>

513
00:30:25.650 --> 00:30:30.650
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so I'm sort of making the point that </v>

514
00:30:30.650 --> 00:30:30.650
<v Speaker 3>these people are happy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're just like,</v>

515
00:30:30.650 --> 00:30:32.700
<v Speaker 3>just like you could be.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And uh,</v>

516
00:30:32.701 --> 00:30:35.370
<v Speaker 3>I hope you'll look at our website and </v>
<v Speaker 3>see what we're,</v>

517
00:30:35.371 --> 00:30:37.530
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what we're looking for and considerate.</v>

518
00:30:39.470 --> 00:30:41.330
<v Speaker 3>So I'm just going to wrap up by talking </v>
<v Speaker 3>about,</v>

519
00:30:41.331 --> 00:30:46.331
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I used to be a professor here at </v>

520
00:30:46.331 --> 00:30:48.581
<v Speaker 3>Carnegie Mellon and when I was a </v>
<v Speaker 3>professor will use the mostly wrote </v>

521
00:30:48.581 --> 00:30:50.840
<v Speaker 3>papers and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we were excited by,</v>

522
00:30:50.841 --> 00:30:51.350
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

523
00:30:51.410 --> 00:30:52.910
<v Speaker 3>how many papers we could,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right,</v>

524
00:30:53.150 --> 00:30:56.120
<v Speaker 3>and how many people cited them,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

525
00:30:56.121 --> 00:31:01.121
<v Speaker 3>in their papers.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But as a company guy instead of papers,</v>

526
00:31:01.371 --> 00:31:06.371
<v Speaker 3>I think we count youtube hits a and </v>
<v Speaker 3>instead of citations want to tell you </v>

527
00:31:07.551 --> 00:31:10.670
<v Speaker 3>what this is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but most of you probably know.</v>

528
00:31:36.060 --> 00:31:41.060
<v Speaker 3>So now we count.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now we count spoofs instead of </v>

529
00:31:41.060 --> 00:31:43.791
<v Speaker 3>citations.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I'm happy to say that we're doing </v>

530
00:31:43.791 --> 00:31:43.791
<v Speaker 3>great.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We have about,</v>

531
00:31:43.791 --> 00:31:45.480
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

532
00:31:45.481 --> 00:31:49.320
<v Speaker 3>about two dozen big dog spoofs.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Here's four of them.</v>

533
00:31:49.620 --> 00:31:52.380
<v Speaker 3>In the upper left is in Akihabara,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Japan.</v>

534
00:31:52.560 --> 00:31:55.530
<v Speaker 3>The upper right is a Los Angeles online </v>
<v Speaker 3>television show.</v>

535
00:31:55.860 --> 00:32:00.860
<v Speaker 3>It's the Netherlands on the lower left.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I guess that's Appalachia on the </v>

536
00:32:00.860 --> 00:32:03.820
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The poor kid doesn't even have a friend</v>

537
00:32:03.890 --> 00:32:07.840
<v Speaker 2>to a to be in his movie.</v>

538
00:32:09.380 --> 00:32:10.400
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what about,</v>

539
00:32:10.401 --> 00:32:15.401
<v Speaker 3>what about atlas?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Can you hear that?</v>

540
00:32:37.740 --> 00:32:38.620
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>

541
00:32:41.410 --> 00:32:42.820
<v Speaker 3>Here's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>here's another one.</v>

542
00:33:11.450 --> 00:33:16.450
<v Speaker 2>Thank you.</v>

543
00:33:19.370 --> 00:33:24.370
<v Speaker 3>So we have,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we have a big crew working on all these </v>

544
00:33:24.370 --> 00:33:27.491
<v Speaker 3>projects.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You see you've gotten to meet a couple </v>

545
00:33:27.491 --> 00:33:27.491
<v Speaker 3>of them here,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's really quite a team in a,</v>

546
00:33:27.491 --> 00:33:28.940
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>an absolute pleasure to work with.</v>

547
00:33:29.180 --> 00:33:29.990
<v Speaker 3>So anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 3>thank you.</v>

548
00:33:30.600 --> 00:33:35.600
<v Speaker 2>Thank you.</v>

549
00:33:39.390 --> 00:33:41.550
<v Speaker 1>Thanks for the presentation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was amazing.</v>

550
00:33:41.760 --> 00:33:44.880
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what sort of physics simulation,</v>

551
00:33:45.240 --> 00:33:50.240
<v Speaker 1>like if any do you have in your robots </v>
<v Speaker 1>and do you really retain dead lake with </v>

552
00:33:51.661 --> 00:33:56.661
<v Speaker 1>the current trend of neural networks?</v>
<v Speaker 1>We can just like do end to end modeling </v>

553
00:33:56.661 --> 00:34:00.291
<v Speaker 1>of these robots,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but like without any sort of notion of </v>

554
00:34:00.291 --> 00:34:00.291
<v Speaker 1>physics but just like neural networks.</v>

555
00:34:00.980 --> 00:34:05.980
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so we have simulators that we've worked </v>

556
00:34:05.980 --> 00:34:08.270
<v Speaker 3>on for a long time,</v>
<v Speaker 3>very detailed in some cases validated,</v>

557
00:34:08.271 --> 00:34:12.450
<v Speaker 3>validated me and compare the behavior of</v>
<v Speaker 3>the simulator to the physics of,</v>

558
00:34:13.070 --> 00:34:15.130
<v Speaker 3>of ground truth.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And uh,</v>

559
00:34:15.900 --> 00:34:20.900
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think they're important for our work </v>

560
00:34:20.900 --> 00:34:22.930
<v Speaker 3>and we use them frequently,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but the end to end doesn't ring quite </v>

561
00:34:22.930 --> 00:34:24.620
<v Speaker 3>true.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Usually the one we use simulation,</v>

562
00:34:24.980 --> 00:34:29.980
<v Speaker 3>the user is knowledgeable about the </v>
<v Speaker 3>tradeoffs between doing a physical </v>

563
00:34:29.980 --> 00:34:34.631
<v Speaker 3>experiment and doing a simulated </v>
<v Speaker 3>experiment and they're usually getting </v>

564
00:34:34.631 --> 00:34:38.261
<v Speaker 3>at some specifically or specific setup </v>
<v Speaker 3>question rather than the idea that you </v>

565
00:34:39.111 --> 00:34:40.460
<v Speaker 3>start at one end,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

566
00:34:40.470 --> 00:34:45.470
<v Speaker 3>to at least in our experience trying to </v>
<v Speaker 3>simulate all the subtleties of the </v>

567
00:34:46.701 --> 00:34:51.230
<v Speaker 3>hydraulic actuator,</v>
<v Speaker 3>backlashing gears a flexibility,</v>

568
00:34:51.390 --> 00:34:51.820
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

569
00:34:51.830 --> 00:34:56.830
<v Speaker 3>the non rigidity in the components,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's a big undertaking and usually so,</v>

570
00:34:57.800 --> 00:35:02.390
<v Speaker 3>so I'm distracting that you can't really</v>
<v Speaker 3>get on with what you're doing.</v>

571
00:35:02.391 --> 00:35:07.391
<v Speaker 3>So I think we use experiment for those </v>
<v Speaker 3>subtleties and we use simulation for a </v>

572
00:35:07.520 --> 00:35:09.620
<v Speaker 3>bigger level dynamics questions.</v>

573
00:35:13.350 --> 00:35:18.350
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>would you say mechanical concerns or </v>

574
00:35:18.350 --> 00:35:22.580
<v Speaker 1>computational capability is more of a </v>
<v Speaker 1>difficulty in terms of determining how </v>

575
00:35:23.791 --> 00:35:26.670
<v Speaker 1>quickly you can perform tasks with the </v>
<v Speaker 1>robots?</v>

576
00:35:27.820 --> 00:35:29.020
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

577
00:35:29.021 --> 00:35:30.820
<v Speaker 3>we like to say that they're equally </v>
<v Speaker 3>important.</v>

578
00:35:30.821 --> 00:35:31.930
<v Speaker 3>We,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we now,</v>

579
00:35:31.931 --> 00:35:36.730
<v Speaker 3>although we didn't start out this way,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we now have equal strength in our groups</v>

580
00:35:36.731 --> 00:35:41.731
<v Speaker 3>in mechanical design and implementation </v>
<v Speaker 3>and in the software and controls and </v>

581
00:35:42.391 --> 00:35:44.550
<v Speaker 3>sensing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I think,</v>

582
00:35:44.690 --> 00:35:45.990
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they all matter.</v>

583
00:35:46.260 --> 00:35:50.730
<v Speaker 3>I think if you try and get by with just </v>
<v Speaker 3>marginally designed hardware,</v>

584
00:35:51.040 --> 00:35:56.040
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you don't get much experimental time in </v>

585
00:35:56.040 --> 00:35:56.040
<v Speaker 3>because the thing's broken all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

586
00:35:56.040 --> 00:35:57.810
<v Speaker 3>so even though we are rough on our </v>
<v Speaker 3>machines,</v>

587
00:35:58.140 --> 00:36:03.140
<v Speaker 3>they mostly keep working because,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because we put a lot of attention to </v>

588
00:36:03.140 --> 00:36:05.100
<v Speaker 3>detail and how they're designed.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

589
00:36:05.370 --> 00:36:06.450
<v Speaker 3>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's still the,</v>

590
00:36:06.451 --> 00:36:10.170
<v Speaker 3>I think perception is still a tall pole </v>
<v Speaker 3>in the tent.</v>

591
00:36:11.040 --> 00:36:14.000
<v Speaker 3>Certainly if you want to rival human </v>
<v Speaker 3>perception,</v>

592
00:36:14.010 --> 00:36:19.010
<v Speaker 3>I don't think we're anywhere near there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I said I think the self driving car </v>

593
00:36:19.010 --> 00:36:20.030
<v Speaker 3>stuff is helping.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

594
00:36:20.060 --> 00:36:21.780
<v Speaker 3>there's a lot of interesting things </v>
<v Speaker 3>happened there.</v>

595
00:36:21.781 --> 00:36:24.180
<v Speaker 3>I think specialized hardware is getting,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

596
00:36:24.200 --> 00:36:25.290
<v Speaker 3>a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a six and,</v>

597
00:36:25.430 --> 00:36:28.080
<v Speaker 3>and things that could help.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

598
00:36:28.110 --> 00:36:29.540
<v Speaker 3>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

599
00:36:29.550 --> 00:36:31.230
<v Speaker 3>it's all still needed.</v>

600
00:36:35.670 --> 00:36:37.530
<v Speaker 4>So,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

601
00:36:37.740 --> 00:36:42.740
<v Speaker 4>you guys have developed various </v>
<v Speaker 4>components that all kind of come </v>

602
00:36:42.740 --> 00:36:46.911
<v Speaker 4>together to build one robot.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Have you seen applications for any of </v>

603
00:36:46.911 --> 00:36:49.290
<v Speaker 4>these separate components elsewhere?</v>
<v Speaker 4>So a organic design,</v>

604
00:36:49.291 --> 00:36:50.940
<v Speaker 4>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 4>for the atlas,</v>

605
00:36:50.941 --> 00:36:55.941
<v Speaker 4>maybe prosthetics or hip replacements or</v>
<v Speaker 4>something like that because there seems </v>

606
00:36:55.941 --> 00:37:00.231
<v Speaker 4>to be a lot of development going on and </v>
<v Speaker 4>then individually as well as that they </v>

607
00:37:00.231 --> 00:37:00.231
<v Speaker 4>pay.</v>

608
00:37:00.231 --> 00:37:00.231
<v Speaker 3>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

609
00:37:00.231 --> 00:37:04.990
<v Speaker 3>you're asking a very good question.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's a question in case people </v>

610
00:37:04.990 --> 00:37:07.361
<v Speaker 3>couldn't hear his are,</v>
<v Speaker 3>aside from the value to the whole robot </v>

611
00:37:07.400 --> 00:37:12.400
<v Speaker 3>of the components we're making,</v>
<v Speaker 3>are the components useful some other </v>

612
00:37:12.400 --> 00:37:12.400
<v Speaker 3>way.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And uh,</v>

613
00:37:12.400 --> 00:37:12.400
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

614
00:37:12.400 --> 00:37:17.370
<v Speaker 3>the place where we think it's probably </v>
<v Speaker 3>most true is the specialized hydraulic </v>

615
00:37:17.370 --> 00:37:20.490
<v Speaker 3>components.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We've made servo valves and uh,</v>

616
00:37:20.610 --> 00:37:25.610
<v Speaker 3>the HPU,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm sure we could sell them into other </v>

617
00:37:25.610 --> 00:37:26.670
<v Speaker 3>industry,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

618
00:37:26.760 --> 00:37:29.360
<v Speaker 3>as a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>as a company focused question though,</v>

619
00:37:29.810 --> 00:37:32.390
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that that's really what it comes to.</v>

620
00:37:32.410 --> 00:37:37.410
<v Speaker 3>Do we really want to be doing that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Will that absorb too much time and </v>

621
00:37:37.410 --> 00:37:39.080
<v Speaker 3>attention and personnel or do we want </v>
<v Speaker 3>to,</v>

622
00:37:39.081 --> 00:37:42.110
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>our heart is really in building a future</v>

623
00:37:42.111 --> 00:37:47.111
<v Speaker 3>generations of robots.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I think we're going to probably stay </v>

624
00:37:47.111 --> 00:37:47.111
<v Speaker 3>there.</v>

625
00:37:47.111 --> 00:37:47.111
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

626
00:37:48.590 --> 00:37:50.490
<v Speaker 5>Thanks.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I was wondering,</v>

627
00:37:50.760 --> 00:37:55.760
<v Speaker 5>have you done any research in regards to</v>
<v Speaker 5>getting the robots to perform tasks </v>

628
00:37:55.760 --> 00:37:57.480
<v Speaker 5>involving direct physical contact with </v>
<v Speaker 5>humans?</v>

629
00:38:00.260 --> 00:38:00.680
<v Speaker 2>Nope,</v>

630
00:38:01.720 --> 00:38:03.550
<v Speaker 3>I can.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Only.</v>

631
00:38:03.670 --> 00:38:06.070
<v Speaker 3>The only thing we've done is we've done </v>
<v Speaker 3>tele operation,</v>

632
00:38:06.071 --> 00:38:11.071
<v Speaker 3>which is not what you mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>where we have a human moving and the </v>

633
00:38:11.071 --> 00:38:11.071
<v Speaker 3>robot,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

634
00:38:11.071 --> 00:38:13.210
<v Speaker 3>copying,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is very interesting because,</v>

635
00:38:13.570 --> 00:38:16.330
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can see that that's a way of showing</v>

636
00:38:16.780 --> 00:38:21.780
<v Speaker 3>how fast the robot can be and how </v>
<v Speaker 3>coordinated they can be using a human </v>

637
00:38:21.780 --> 00:38:22.570
<v Speaker 3>and for part of the computing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

638
00:38:22.850 --> 00:38:27.850
<v Speaker 3>but we have,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we don't have them interacting with </v>

639
00:38:27.850 --> 00:38:29.701
<v Speaker 3>people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I guess the closest as we once did a </v>

640
00:38:29.701 --> 00:38:32.221
<v Speaker 3>thing where a person and a robot picked </v>
<v Speaker 3>up a stretcher and work together to pick</v>

641
00:38:32.321 --> 00:38:34.750
<v Speaker 3>up the stretcher,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but they weren't touching each other.</v>

642
00:38:34.751 --> 00:38:36.440
<v Speaker 3>They going through the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

643
00:38:36.700 --> 00:38:40.450
<v Speaker 3>the stretcher material.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We have plans,</v>

644
00:38:41.170 --> 00:38:42.370
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

645
00:38:42.700 --> 00:38:44.170
<v Speaker 3>we're really,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to be honest,</v>

646
00:38:44.171 --> 00:38:48.820
<v Speaker 3>we're really struggling with coming up </v>
<v Speaker 3>with some strong concepts for safety.</v>

647
00:38:48.940 --> 00:38:51.130
<v Speaker 3>Even without doing that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

648
00:38:51.280 --> 00:38:52.450
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>robots,</v>

649
00:38:52.920 --> 00:38:54.440
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

650
00:38:55.150 --> 00:39:00.150
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>your first real people's first reaction </v>

651
00:39:00.150 --> 00:39:00.150
<v Speaker 3>and how you make a robot safe if there's</v>
<v Speaker 3>a problem,</v>

652
00:39:00.190 --> 00:39:02.710
<v Speaker 3>don't really work very well.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can't freeze the robot,</v>

653
00:39:03.270 --> 00:39:05.110
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you have to find some,</v>

654
00:39:05.111 --> 00:39:09.670
<v Speaker 3>you have to keep them going.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I find a way to get into a safer state.</v>

655
00:39:09.820 --> 00:39:13.930
<v Speaker 3>So I think having come in contact with </v>
<v Speaker 3>people is just gonna be harder.</v>

656
00:39:14.320 --> 00:39:17.410
<v Speaker 3>So eventually we want to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to help to carry the lift,</v>

657
00:39:17.411 --> 00:39:20.080
<v Speaker 3>the elderly and things like that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But we're not there yet.</v>

658
00:39:22.850 --> 00:39:27.850
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my question is about the relative rates </v>

659
00:39:27.850 --> 00:39:27.850
<v Speaker 1>of progress in robotics and machine </v>
<v Speaker 1>intelligence.</v>

660
00:39:28.080 --> 00:39:33.080
<v Speaker 1>So an economist might maybe measure it </v>
<v Speaker 1>by seeing how much money is going into </v>

661
00:39:33.080 --> 00:39:35.770
<v Speaker 1>computing hardware versus arms and legs </v>
<v Speaker 1>centers naturally,</v>

662
00:39:35.980 --> 00:39:37.500
<v Speaker 1>that kind of thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

663
00:39:38.010 --> 00:39:42.460
<v Speaker 1>so on one one possible scenario,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the um,</v>

664
00:39:42.940 --> 00:39:47.940
<v Speaker 1>the machine intelligence receives the </v>
<v Speaker 1>head and the robots a progressing more </v>

665
00:39:48.121 --> 00:39:52.710
<v Speaker 1>slowly because of a kind of a slow build</v>
<v Speaker 1>test cycle.</v>

666
00:39:52.711 --> 00:39:54.300
<v Speaker 1>Basically it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they will well things,</v>

667
00:39:54.450 --> 00:39:56.850
<v Speaker 1>it's not so easy to get a rapid build </v>
<v Speaker 1>test cycle with a robot.</v>

668
00:39:58.540 --> 00:40:03.540
<v Speaker 1>And then the other scenario,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the robots are more advanced than the </v>

669
00:40:03.540 --> 00:40:07.790
<v Speaker 1>machine intelligence.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Machine intelligence is just such a </v>

670
00:40:07.790 --> 00:40:10.401
<v Speaker 1>conceptually difficult problem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I'm in one side of the machines are </v>

671
00:40:10.401 --> 00:40:14.331
<v Speaker 1>telling the humans want to do in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>other scenario that humans telling the </v>

672
00:40:14.331 --> 00:40:14.331
<v Speaker 1>machines what to do if you'd like.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

673
00:40:14.331 --> 00:40:19.280
<v Speaker 1>so do you have any kind of perspective </v>
<v Speaker 1>on that whole issue with the machine </v>

674
00:40:19.280 --> 00:40:20.800
<v Speaker 1>intelligence folk going to rush ahead </v>
<v Speaker 1>using robots,</v>

675
00:40:20.880 --> 00:40:25.880
<v Speaker 1>guys struggling behind or the robot's </v>
<v Speaker 1>going to get there before the massive </v>

676
00:40:25.880 --> 00:40:28.710
<v Speaker 1>problem and machine intelligence get </v>
<v Speaker 1>sold or maybe somewhere in the middle</v>

677
00:40:28.730 --> 00:40:30.210
<v Speaker 3>I think.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Let's see.</v>

678
00:40:30.211 --> 00:40:32.520
<v Speaker 3>I don't know exactly what you mean by </v>
<v Speaker 3>machine intelligence.</v>

679
00:40:32.940 --> 00:40:35.280
<v Speaker 3>Are you talking about um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

680
00:40:35.281 --> 00:40:38.790
<v Speaker 3>having Google do better search.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So we were intelligent</v>

681
00:40:39.020 --> 00:40:41.650
<v Speaker 1>mutation in general.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I start,</v>

682
00:40:41.660 --> 00:40:43.760
<v Speaker 1>I talked about economists measuring </v>
<v Speaker 1>sensors,</v>

683
00:40:43.761 --> 00:40:45.920
<v Speaker 1>actuators,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and compute hardware.</v>

684
00:40:46.100 --> 00:40:48.700
<v Speaker 1>So that's the kind of split I'm thinking</v>
<v Speaker 1>about.</v>

685
00:40:49.440 --> 00:40:54.440
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think that it's always been a </v>

686
00:40:54.440 --> 00:40:55.500
<v Speaker 3>misconception that the hardware </v>
<v Speaker 3>components by themselves,</v>

687
00:40:55.930 --> 00:41:00.930
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>constitute progress in intelligence or </v>

688
00:41:02.070 --> 00:41:04.000
<v Speaker 3>in robot behavior.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

689
00:41:04.230 --> 00:41:06.030
<v Speaker 3>they're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think they're important ingredients.</v>

690
00:41:06.031 --> 00:41:07.440
<v Speaker 3>But by themselves,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

691
00:41:07.441 --> 00:41:12.441
<v Speaker 3>when I was a graduate student here,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I can remember reading an ad for a,</v>

692
00:41:12.840 --> 00:41:14.350
<v Speaker 3>an uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

693
00:41:14.400 --> 00:41:18.540
<v Speaker 3>optical character recognition system and</v>
<v Speaker 3>what the ad said was,</v>

694
00:41:18.800 --> 00:41:19.440
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

695
00:41:19.441 --> 00:41:22.950
<v Speaker 3>we have camera,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we have a thing for holding the paper.</v>

696
00:41:22.951 --> 00:41:27.951
<v Speaker 3>You're looking at,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all you have to do is write the </v>

697
00:41:27.951 --> 00:41:29.901
<v Speaker 3>software.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it was all done except for you to </v>

698
00:41:29.901 --> 00:41:29.901
<v Speaker 3>write the software.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And uh,</v>

699
00:41:29.901 --> 00:41:34.071
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's the whole problem was there.</v>

700
00:41:34.910 --> 00:41:37.160
<v Speaker 3>So I don't know if I'm answering your </v>
<v Speaker 3>question.</v>

701
00:41:37.500 --> 00:41:38.480
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

702
00:41:38.481 --> 00:41:40.250
<v Speaker 3>robotics is hard.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

703
00:41:40.251 --> 00:41:43.250
<v Speaker 3>I think it feels like we're making </v>
<v Speaker 3>progress if you keep pushing,</v>

704
00:41:43.370 --> 00:41:48.370
<v Speaker 3>we keep making progress.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not like there's a knee in the </v>

705
00:41:48.370 --> 00:41:50.240
<v Speaker 3>curve that we've hit a.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But I also think that the rest of the ai</v>

706
00:41:50.241 --> 00:41:52.890
<v Speaker 3>world is making a good progress too.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And yeah,</v>

707
00:41:52.990 --> 00:41:55.460
<v Speaker 3>it's fun being a part of it.</v>

708
00:41:58.850 --> 00:42:03.850
<v Speaker 5>Hi,</v>
<v Speaker 5>my question is mostly related to </v>

709
00:42:03.950 --> 00:42:05.270
<v Speaker 5>security.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Uh,</v>

710
00:42:05.330 --> 00:42:08.870
<v Speaker 5>so since you are productizing your </v>
<v Speaker 5>robots now,</v>

711
00:42:09.150 --> 00:42:14.150
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there has been research on the lidars </v>

712
00:42:14.150 --> 00:42:14.620
<v Speaker 5>mainly,</v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

713
00:42:14.720 --> 00:42:19.720
<v Speaker 5>where you could spoof allied are and,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and the sensor basically cannot see </v>

714
00:42:20.421 --> 00:42:21.680
<v Speaker 5>anything.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Uh,</v>

715
00:42:21.710 --> 00:42:26.710
<v Speaker 5>so are you looking into that as well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>taking into consideration these awesome </v>

716
00:42:29.340 --> 00:42:33.290
<v Speaker 5>robots could be in let's say in our </v>
<v Speaker 5>defense,</v>

717
00:42:33.291 --> 00:42:34.910
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>working for the defense as well.</v>

718
00:42:34.911 --> 00:42:36.710
<v Speaker 5>So those are like really harsh </v>
<v Speaker 5>environments.</v>

719
00:42:36.860 --> 00:42:38.690
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean these are very hard problems,</v>

720
00:42:38.691 --> 00:42:40.280
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if someone,</v>

721
00:42:40.281 --> 00:42:45.281
<v Speaker 3>if a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if an intelligent adversary wants to </v>

722
00:42:45.281 --> 00:42:45.650
<v Speaker 3>trick the robot,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's not all that hard,</v>

723
00:42:46.040 --> 00:42:47.420
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>these days,</v>

724
00:42:47.720 --> 00:42:48.290
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

725
00:42:48.291 --> 00:42:53.291
<v Speaker 3>we're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're working probably the other end of </v>

726
00:42:53.291 --> 00:42:53.291
<v Speaker 3>the problem,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

727
00:42:53.291 --> 00:42:53.291
<v Speaker 3>trying to do the basics.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

728
00:42:53.291 --> 00:42:54.290
<v Speaker 3>right now,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

729
00:42:54.291 --> 00:42:56.750
<v Speaker 3>I don't think,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

730
00:42:56.900 --> 00:43:01.900
<v Speaker 3>I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't think robots are going to be as </v>

731
00:43:01.900 --> 00:43:04.661
<v Speaker 3>autonomous in a hostile environment as,</v>
<v Speaker 3>as people either think or fear,</v>

732
00:43:05.630 --> 00:43:07.160
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because uh,</v>

733
00:43:07.170 --> 00:43:10.640
<v Speaker 3>of how frail they'll still be a until we</v>
<v Speaker 3>get further along.</v>

734
00:43:14.340 --> 00:43:15.260
<v Speaker 6>Hi there.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Hey,</v>

735
00:43:15.850 --> 00:43:19.490
<v Speaker 6>I wanted to ask about two things that </v>
<v Speaker 6>are going to probably play a big role in</v>

736
00:43:19.491 --> 00:43:22.310
<v Speaker 6>adoption.</v>
<v Speaker 6>The first is price,</v>

737
00:43:22.311 --> 00:43:24.920
<v Speaker 6>so if you could speak to the current </v>
<v Speaker 6>unit price of a spot,</v>

738
00:43:24.921 --> 00:43:27.290
<v Speaker 6>many and how that you think is going to </v>
<v Speaker 6>evolve over time.</v>

739
00:43:27.780 --> 00:43:31.160
<v Speaker 6>And the second is sort of consumer </v>
<v Speaker 6>psychology.</v>

740
00:43:31.210 --> 00:43:33.710
<v Speaker 6>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I felt like when I saw the,</v>

741
00:43:33.711 --> 00:43:34.540
<v Speaker 6>um,</v>
<v Speaker 6>the,</v>

742
00:43:34.570 --> 00:43:39.570
<v Speaker 6>the test at the end of the robot </v>
<v Speaker 6>swearing my level of comfort with it </v>

743
00:43:39.570 --> 00:43:41.360
<v Speaker 6>being in my house suddenly shot up </v>
<v Speaker 6>because it seemed way more human.</v>

744
00:43:41.690 --> 00:43:44.990
<v Speaker 6>So I was just thinking about what kinds </v>
<v Speaker 6>of experiments you guys have run away,</v>

745
00:43:45.150 --> 00:43:50.150
<v Speaker 6>what you've thought about with respect </v>
<v Speaker 6>to making people more comfortable with </v>

746
00:43:50.150 --> 00:43:50.150
<v Speaker 6>robots working around them.</v>

747
00:43:50.670 --> 00:43:51.330
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

748
00:43:51.630 --> 00:43:53.100
<v Speaker 3>in terms of costs,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

749
00:43:53.490 --> 00:43:58.490
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're not saying what this thing costs </v>

750
00:43:58.490 --> 00:43:58.490
<v Speaker 3>yet,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but we will later in the year,</v>

751
00:43:58.490 --> 00:44:03.380
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we have reduced the cost of this by </v>

752
00:44:03.380 --> 00:44:04.270
<v Speaker 3>about a factor of 10 from what the first</v>
<v Speaker 3>prototypes cost.</v>

753
00:44:04.560 --> 00:44:06.680
<v Speaker 3>So we're making progress.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

754
00:44:07.350 --> 00:44:11.730
<v Speaker 3>in terms of the psychology of robots,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's been very interesting to watch,</v>

755
00:44:12.030 --> 00:44:13.470
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we uh,</v>

756
00:44:14.190 --> 00:44:18.390
<v Speaker 3>we got branded sort of as robot abusers </v>
<v Speaker 3>because we kicked our robot.</v>

757
00:44:18.920 --> 00:44:23.880
<v Speaker 3>Really what we were doing was trying to </v>
<v Speaker 3>show how good they were at balancing and</v>

758
00:44:23.881 --> 00:44:25.830
<v Speaker 3>we weren't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we didn't think we were abusing him.</v>

759
00:44:26.040 --> 00:44:31.040
<v Speaker 3>I have video of me pushing on my </v>
<v Speaker 3>daughter when she was one years old and </v>

760
00:44:31.040 --> 00:44:32.130
<v Speaker 3>actually knocking her over,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but that wasn't my goal.</v>

761
00:44:32.131 --> 00:44:35.100
<v Speaker 3>I wanted to kind of test out her her </v>
<v Speaker 3>balance and uh,</v>

762
00:44:35.590 --> 00:44:37.440
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I bet you,</v>

763
00:44:37.470 --> 00:44:42.470
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you guys have kids or you're or at </v>

764
00:44:42.470 --> 00:44:42.470
<v Speaker 3>all that you've done stuff like that.</v>

765
00:44:42.470 --> 00:44:43.950
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so,</v>

766
00:44:43.980 --> 00:44:48.980
<v Speaker 3>but we've adjusted a little bit and so </v>
<v Speaker 3>we don't usually push on the robots in </v>

767
00:44:48.980 --> 00:44:53.511
<v Speaker 3>our videos despite the one we showed </v>
<v Speaker 3>with the hockey and hockey sticking a </v>

768
00:44:54.330 --> 00:44:56.180
<v Speaker 3>hand on this thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

769
00:44:56.370 --> 00:45:01.370
<v Speaker 3>that's why we had the banana peels.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's a way to have the robot crash </v>

770
00:45:01.370 --> 00:45:02.280
<v Speaker 3>without us being having our fingerprints</v>
<v Speaker 3>on it.</v>

771
00:45:02.810 --> 00:45:04.610
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

772
00:45:05.530 --> 00:45:10.530
<v Speaker 3>I guess the other data point I have is </v>
<v Speaker 3>that if you look at the likes and </v>

773
00:45:10.831 --> 00:45:13.770
<v Speaker 3>dislikes on our youtube videos,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

774
00:45:13.771 --> 00:45:18.771
<v Speaker 3>we found a way to get the likes to </v>
<v Speaker 3>dislikes ratio much higher by partly </v>

775
00:45:19.351 --> 00:45:23.250
<v Speaker 3>probably by not looking like we're </v>
<v Speaker 3>abusing the,</v>

776
00:45:23.251 --> 00:45:24.120
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

777
00:45:24.140 --> 00:45:25.570
<v Speaker 3>the robots.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

778
00:45:25.590 --> 00:45:28.680
<v Speaker 3>there's probably a long way to go to </v>
<v Speaker 3>make these things really friendly.</v>

779
00:45:29.160 --> 00:45:31.060
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and uh,</v>

780
00:45:31.910 --> 00:45:36.910
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I have to admit there's a little spirit </v>

781
00:45:36.910 --> 00:45:37.560
<v Speaker 3>at our,</v>
<v Speaker 3>at our company of being kind of a,</v>

782
00:45:37.620 --> 00:45:40.530
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's fun being bad boys in terms of uh,</v>

783
00:45:40.630 --> 00:45:45.630
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just make the robot do cool stuff and </v>

784
00:45:45.630 --> 00:45:45.630
<v Speaker 3>leave the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

785
00:45:45.630 --> 00:45:46.860
<v Speaker 3>the emotions to others.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

786
00:45:46.861 --> 00:45:51.861
<v Speaker 3>and certainly the social robots that </v>
<v Speaker 3>have so much going into making them </v>

787
00:45:51.861 --> 00:45:52.950
<v Speaker 3>cute.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

788
00:45:53.640 --> 00:45:58.640
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm sure we'll have marketing people </v>

789
00:45:58.640 --> 00:45:58.650
<v Speaker 3>working on that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know what else to say.</v>

790
00:46:01.410 --> 00:46:05.750
<v Speaker 1>Hi.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So in terms of research purpose,</v>

791
00:46:05.880 --> 00:46:10.880
<v Speaker 1>our practical purposes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so one of the reasons to choose to </v>

792
00:46:10.880 --> 00:46:11.090
<v Speaker 1>investigate on this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

793
00:46:11.200 --> 00:46:13.720
<v Speaker 1>humanoid robots.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it seems like,</v>

794
00:46:13.900 --> 00:46:16.690
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it cannot run as fast as the Cheetah and</v>

795
00:46:16.691 --> 00:46:21.691
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it also cannot carry as many staff as </v>

796
00:46:21.691 --> 00:46:21.691
<v Speaker 1>the big dog.</v>

797
00:46:21.691 --> 00:46:26.160
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're basically saying that the </v>

798
00:46:26.160 --> 00:46:26.870
<v Speaker 3>humanized don't seem to be as practical </v>
<v Speaker 3>in terms of function</v>

799
00:46:27.980 --> 00:46:29.430
<v Speaker 1>more efficient,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like a,</v>

800
00:46:29.670 --> 00:46:34.000
<v Speaker 1>like a humanoid robot is more efficient </v>
<v Speaker 1>than these are cheaters and the big box.</v>

801
00:46:34.730 --> 00:46:37.640
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the motivated.</v>

802
00:46:37.730 --> 00:46:40.040
<v Speaker 3>So I don't have a good answer.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

803
00:46:40.041 --> 00:46:43.520
<v Speaker 3>the motivation for the DRC that Darpa </v>
<v Speaker 3>robotics challenge,</v>

804
00:46:43.760 --> 00:46:48.760
<v Speaker 3>which was humanoid robots,</v>
<v Speaker 3>was to say that they wanted to use </v>

805
00:46:48.760 --> 00:46:50.780
<v Speaker 3>robots that could go the places designed</v>
<v Speaker 3>for humans.</v>

806
00:46:51.500 --> 00:46:56.500
<v Speaker 3>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and so that's why they used the human </v>

807
00:46:56.500 --> 00:46:56.500
<v Speaker 3>form.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I think,</v>

808
00:46:56.500 --> 00:46:56.500
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's an argument there.</v>

809
00:46:56.790 --> 00:46:59.180
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it is true that the,</v>

810
00:46:59.181 --> 00:47:02.300
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>human form has a lot of complexity to it</v>

811
00:47:02.600 --> 00:47:07.600
<v Speaker 3>because you have very complicated legs </v>
<v Speaker 3>in the IPAD and they're supporting the </v>

812
00:47:07.600 --> 00:47:11.651
<v Speaker 3>weight of the body and the arms,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whereas the quieter beds can spread all </v>

813
00:47:11.651 --> 00:47:12.180
<v Speaker 3>that out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm,</v>

814
00:47:14.370 --> 00:47:17.240
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so I'm sympathetic to your question.</v>

815
00:47:17.241 --> 00:47:19.440
<v Speaker 3>I don't really have an answer.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

816
00:47:19.670 --> 00:47:24.670
<v Speaker 3>I can tell you that the public's </v>
<v Speaker 3>reaction to a humanoid robot is off the </v>

817
00:47:24.670 --> 00:47:29.471
<v Speaker 3>scale compared to anything we've done </v>
<v Speaker 3>with a quadrupedal robots for what </v>

818
00:47:29.471 --> 00:47:30.640
<v Speaker 3>that's worth.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

819
00:47:30.641 --> 00:47:35.641
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we always get a lot of viewership if we </v>

820
00:47:35.641 --> 00:47:36.180
<v Speaker 3>show a human doing something.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

821
00:47:36.730 --> 00:47:38.980
<v Speaker 3>but I think it's a question that we will</v>
<v Speaker 3>keep addressing.</v>

822
00:47:39.210 --> 00:47:43.370
<v Speaker 3>We are gonna keep pushing on getting the</v>
<v Speaker 3>humanoid to do more and more human,</v>

823
00:47:43.371 --> 00:47:45.000
<v Speaker 3>like things.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

824
00:47:45.100 --> 00:47:50.100
<v Speaker 3>even though we probably won't </v>
<v Speaker 3>commercialize them as soon as we </v>

825
00:47:50.100 --> 00:47:50.100
<v Speaker 3>commercialize the other stuff,</v>

826
00:47:52.440 --> 00:47:57.440
<v Speaker 1>how do you specify goals?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And although you said earlier that it's </v>

827
00:47:57.440 --> 00:47:57.440
<v Speaker 1>expensive to do like simulations and </v>
<v Speaker 1>stuff,</v>

828
00:47:57.690 --> 00:48:00.600
<v Speaker 1>do you have any intentions of doing any </v>
<v Speaker 1>deep reinforcement learning?</v>

829
00:48:01.160 --> 00:48:01.820
<v Speaker 3>What was the last time?</v>

830
00:48:02.170 --> 00:48:04.480
<v Speaker 1>Do you have any intentions of doing deep</v>
<v Speaker 1>reinforcement learning?</v>

831
00:48:05.630 --> 00:48:10.140
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'll do the last one first.</v>

832
00:48:10.141 --> 00:48:10.590
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

833
00:48:12.080 --> 00:48:14.490
<v Speaker 3>we,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm sure we will use learning before too</v>

834
00:48:14.491 --> 00:48:15.760
<v Speaker 3>long.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

835
00:48:15.770 --> 00:48:20.770
<v Speaker 3>I'm not sure whether it will be deep </v>
<v Speaker 3>reinforcement learning or something </v>

836
00:48:20.770 --> 00:48:23.931
<v Speaker 3>else,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but mostly we're interested in </v>

837
00:48:23.931 --> 00:48:26.340
<v Speaker 3>optimizing the complicated a stage space</v>
<v Speaker 3>partitioning.</v>

838
00:48:26.341 --> 00:48:29.790
<v Speaker 3>We do a right now we use,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

839
00:48:29.791 --> 00:48:34.791
<v Speaker 3>people make a very simple decisions as </v>
<v Speaker 3>to how to divide up the space and we </v>

840
00:48:35.011 --> 00:48:38.640
<v Speaker 3>think that these things could probably </v>
<v Speaker 3>be a really improved if we,</v>

841
00:48:38.641 --> 00:48:39.590
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

842
00:48:39.600 --> 00:48:44.600
<v Speaker 3>use the learning approach,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's probably the first place we will </v>

843
00:48:44.600 --> 00:48:46.971
<v Speaker 3>apply it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We do a little bit of learning here and </v>

844
00:48:46.971 --> 00:48:49.281
<v Speaker 3>there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but not much compared to how much </v>

845
00:48:49.281 --> 00:48:49.281
<v Speaker 3>learning is talked about out there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What was the other question?</v>

846
00:48:51.540 --> 00:48:56.540
<v Speaker 3>How do we specify a goal?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You mean to the robot or how do we </v>

847
00:48:56.540 --> 00:48:59.721
<v Speaker 3>decide as a company?</v>
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

848
00:49:00.060 --> 00:49:05.060
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't think there's any across the </v>

849
00:49:05.060 --> 00:49:05.130
<v Speaker 3>board answer.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We write applications,</v>

850
00:49:05.310 --> 00:49:07.620
<v Speaker 3>for instance,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for each of these uses.</v>

851
00:49:07.860 --> 00:49:09.330
<v Speaker 3>So for instance,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in the,</v>

852
00:49:09.331 --> 00:49:11.640
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>where we were doing the patrol route,</v>

853
00:49:11.641 --> 00:49:15.210
<v Speaker 3>we have an application that has a Ui </v>
<v Speaker 3>that lets the user,</v>

854
00:49:15.530 --> 00:49:16.120
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

855
00:49:16.140 --> 00:49:17.920
<v Speaker 3>tell it the information it needs to </v>
<v Speaker 3>tell,</v>

856
00:49:18.060 --> 00:49:20.880
<v Speaker 3>can tell it to go ahead and start on the</v>
<v Speaker 3>patrol.</v>

857
00:49:21.130 --> 00:49:22.470
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and things like that.</v>

858
00:49:22.740 --> 00:49:24.060
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for,</v>

859
00:49:24.480 --> 00:49:25.920
<v Speaker 3>for the door,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think,</v>

860
00:49:26.280 --> 00:49:27.270
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think,</v>

861
00:49:27.271 --> 00:49:28.600
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's a button on the,</v>

862
00:49:28.700 --> 00:49:31.440
<v Speaker 3>on the controller we can show you </v>
<v Speaker 3>afterwards if you want.</v>

863
00:49:31.740 --> 00:49:34.380
<v Speaker 3>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you walk the robot up to the door,</v>

864
00:49:34.381 --> 00:49:39.381
<v Speaker 3>were you steering it and then you press </v>
<v Speaker 3>the button and then it starts looking </v>

865
00:49:39.381 --> 00:49:39.960
<v Speaker 3>for the door handle and it goes through </v>
<v Speaker 3>the whole,</v>

866
00:49:40.210 --> 00:49:41.490
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>goes through the door.</v>

867
00:49:44.840 --> 00:49:46.610
<v Speaker 3>But I don't think these answers are </v>
<v Speaker 3>fundamental.</v>

868
00:49:46.611 --> 00:49:48.230
<v Speaker 3>I think you could do it lots of </v>
<v Speaker 3>different ways.</v>

869
00:49:48.590 --> 00:49:53.590
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're working on all the machinery </v>

870
00:49:53.590 --> 00:49:53.930
<v Speaker 3>coming up from the bottom to be able to </v>
<v Speaker 3>do these things.</v>

871
00:49:54.200 --> 00:49:54.830
<v Speaker 3>And then,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

872
00:49:54.831 --> 00:49:56.750
<v Speaker 3>in some case you could have it be </v>
<v Speaker 3>buttons on a,</v>

873
00:49:56.810 --> 00:49:59.120
<v Speaker 3>on a Ui,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it could be a,</v>

874
00:49:59.240 --> 00:50:02.300
<v Speaker 3>an API that's accessed through some </v>
<v Speaker 3>higher level ai,</v>

875
00:50:02.440 --> 00:50:05.690
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and we just aren't sweating that part of</v>

876
00:50:05.691 --> 00:50:06.350
<v Speaker 3>it at this point.</v>

877
00:50:09.350 --> 00:50:10.150
<v Speaker 1>Hi.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

878
00:50:10.290 --> 00:50:12.470
<v Speaker 1>so aside from locomotion,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

879
00:50:12.471 --> 00:50:17.471
<v Speaker 1>I can use my body for like nonverbal </v>
<v Speaker 1>communication to communicate my </v>

880
00:50:17.471 --> 00:50:19.500
<v Speaker 1>intentions and other such things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even though I'm not always aware of it.</v>

881
00:50:19.980 --> 00:50:24.980
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I'm guess I'm wondering if this is </v>

882
00:50:24.980 --> 00:50:25.920
<v Speaker 1>something that you've considered for </v>
<v Speaker 1>these robots.</v>

883
00:50:26.550 --> 00:50:30.680
<v Speaker 3>I think the we've come is having the </v>
<v Speaker 3>robot go like this after the flip,</v>

884
00:50:30.681 --> 00:50:35.681
<v Speaker 3>which was a way of communicating a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we really haven't done anything along </v>

885
00:50:35.681 --> 00:50:40.511
<v Speaker 3>those lines.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'll bet you though the people writing </v>

886
00:50:40.511 --> 00:50:40.511
<v Speaker 3>code,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

887
00:50:40.511 --> 00:50:40.910
<v Speaker 3>it can interpret it a lot of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>subtleties of what's,</v>

888
00:50:41.270 --> 00:50:43.190
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what's working and what isn't by looking</v>

889
00:50:43.191 --> 00:50:48.191
<v Speaker 3>at things like that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But the robot isn't trying to </v>

890
00:50:48.191 --> 00:50:48.191
<v Speaker 3>communicate that way.</v>

891
00:50:52.390 --> 00:50:57.390
<v Speaker 7>I have two questions.</v>
<v Speaker 7>How robots really,</v>

892
00:51:00.280 --> 00:51:01.390
<v Speaker 7>really fast.</v>

893
00:51:01.750 --> 00:51:02.980
<v Speaker 3>How do we make them fast?</v>

894
00:51:04.440 --> 00:51:09.440
<v Speaker 7>No,</v>
<v Speaker 7>my question is how did you make them </v>

895
00:51:09.440 --> 00:51:13.520
<v Speaker 7>fast?</v>
<v Speaker 7>I mean like the time how,</v>

896
00:51:14.710 --> 00:51:19.710
<v Speaker 3>where you get a lot of people who are </v>
<v Speaker 3>really smart and good at working </v>

897
00:51:20.531 --> 00:51:25.531
<v Speaker 3>together with each other at our lab and </v>
<v Speaker 3>then they make plans and a,</v>

898
00:51:27.700 --> 00:51:30.880
<v Speaker 3>which everybody tries to stay on the </v>
<v Speaker 3>plan and then,</v>

899
00:51:30.910 --> 00:51:32.190
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

900
00:51:32.260 --> 00:51:37.260
<v Speaker 3>pull it together.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Sometimes it doesn't go as fast as we'd </v>

901
00:51:37.260 --> 00:51:40.721
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>especially if we have to buy parts from </v>

902
00:51:40.721 --> 00:51:41.830
<v Speaker 3>someone else and they're slow.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That happens a lot,</v>

903
00:51:42.160 --> 00:51:43.520
<v Speaker 3>honestly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>A,</v>

904
00:51:43.720 --> 00:51:48.400
<v Speaker 3>is that what you mean?</v>
<v Speaker 3>So we don't make them that fast,</v>

905
00:51:48.600 --> 00:51:49.030
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're,</v>

906
00:51:49.110 --> 00:51:50.110
<v Speaker 3>we're pretty fast,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

907
00:51:50.111 --> 00:51:53.830
<v Speaker 3>usually I'm four or five months to build</v>
<v Speaker 3>a new robot.</v>

908
00:51:54.310 --> 00:51:57.190
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>something like that.</v>

909
00:51:57.760 --> 00:51:59.710
<v Speaker 3>But mostly it's getting people to work </v>
<v Speaker 3>together.</v>

910
00:51:59.890 --> 00:52:01.240
<v Speaker 3>What's the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what's the other question?</v>

911
00:52:02.770 --> 00:52:07.330
<v Speaker 7>The other question is why do the people </v>
<v Speaker 7>push the robots?</v>

912
00:52:08.820 --> 00:52:10.210
<v Speaker 3>Why did,</v>
<v Speaker 3>why do they push,</v>

913
00:52:10.960 --> 00:52:14.460
<v Speaker 3>why do they push?</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're trying.</v>

914
00:52:14.490 --> 00:52:19.490
<v Speaker 3>The robots are always balancing them </v>
<v Speaker 3>themselves and so we want to show that </v>

915
00:52:19.490 --> 00:52:21.810
<v Speaker 3>they're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that they can balanced by,</v>

916
00:52:22.200 --> 00:52:23.090
<v Speaker 3>by,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

917
00:52:23.130 --> 00:52:25.200
<v Speaker 3>showing that when you knock them,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they still,</v>

918
00:52:25.580 --> 00:52:27.750
<v Speaker 3>they don't fall over,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they stay up on their feet.</v>

919
00:52:28.050 --> 00:52:33.050
<v Speaker 3>So we're kind of showing off.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Are you building anything?</v>

920
00:52:35.380 --> 00:52:38.620
<v Speaker 3>Why not?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You should,</v>

921
00:52:40.020 --> 00:52:45.020
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's way off what we were in the </v>

922
00:52:46.781 --> 00:52:48.640
<v Speaker 3>basement.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not good at building.</v>

923
00:52:49.000 --> 00:52:49.620
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>

924
00:52:49.690 --> 00:52:52.340
<v Speaker 3>Yes you are.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You might think you're not.</v>

925
00:52:52.520 --> 00:52:55.000
<v Speaker 3>Some games they are.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You had to give it a try.</v>

926
00:52:56.120 --> 00:52:58.420
<v Speaker 3>You're the right age.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The right age to get started.</v>

927
00:52:58.890 --> 00:53:00.070
<v Speaker 3>I'm six and a half.</v>

928
00:53:00.960 --> 00:53:01.590
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

929
00:53:09.400 --> 00:53:13.210
<v Speaker 3>Would that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think please give mark a big hand.</v>

930
00:53:13.260 --> 00:53:13.900
<v Speaker 3>Thank you very much.</v>
