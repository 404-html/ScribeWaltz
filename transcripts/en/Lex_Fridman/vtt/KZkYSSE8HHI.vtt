The following is a conversation with Jeff Atwood.

2
00:00:02.430 --> 00:00:06.690
He's the Co founder of stack overflow and stack exchange websites that are

3
00:00:06.691 --> 00:00:11.670
visited by millions of people every single day.
Much like with Wikipedia,

4
00:00:11.671 --> 00:00:16.440
it is difficult to understate the impact on global knowledge and productivity

5
00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:19.170
that these networks of sites have created.

6
00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:24.560
Jeff is also the author of the fame blog coding core and the founder of

7
00:00:25.111 --> 00:00:30.111
discourse and open source software project that seeks to improve the quality of

8
00:00:30.181 --> 00:00:32.400
our online community discussions.

9
00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:38.310
This conversation is part of the MIT course on artificial general intelligence

10
00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:43.020
and the artificial intelligence podcasts.

D.
And now.

14
00:00:51.810 --> 00:00:54.720
Here's my conversation with Jeff Atwood

15
00:00:56.170 --> 00:00:59.140
<v 1>having cocreated and managed for a few years,</v>

16
00:00:59.141 --> 00:01:03.970
the world's largest community of programmers and in stack overflow 10 years ago.

17
00:01:04.210 --> 00:01:08.590
What do you think
motivates most programmers?

18
00:01:08.620 --> 00:01:13.300
Is it fame,
fortune,
glory process of programming itself,

19
00:01:13.330 --> 00:01:17.980
or is it the sense of belonging to a community?
It's a puzzles really.

20
00:01:17.981 --> 00:01:22.981
I think it's this idea of working on puzzles independently of other people and

21
00:01:24.041 --> 00:01:28.300
just solving a problem sort of like on your own almost.

22
00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:31.480
Although you don't,
nobody really works alone and programming anymore.

23
00:01:32.230 --> 00:01:33.190
But I will say there's a,

24
00:01:33.191 --> 00:01:38.191
there's an aspect of sort of hiding yourself away and just sort of beating on a

25
00:01:38.621 --> 00:01:39.550
problem until you solve it.

26
00:01:39.551 --> 00:01:42.100
Like brute force basically to me is what a lot of programming is,

27
00:01:42.101 --> 00:01:44.320
is like the computer so fast,
right?

28
00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:47.050
You can do things that would take forever for human,
but you just do,

29
00:01:47.051 --> 00:01:51.190
I'm like so many times.
And so often that you get the answer right.

30
00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:55.650
You're saying just the pure act of tinkering with the code.
Yes.
Is,

31
00:01:55.730 --> 00:01:58.630
is the thing that drives most probably the joy,

32
00:01:58.660 --> 00:02:03.660
the struggle balance within the joy of overcoming the brute force process of

33
00:02:04.541 --> 00:02:09.400
pain and suffering that eventually leads to something that actually works well.

34
00:02:09.401 --> 00:02:12.250
Data is fun too.
Like there's this thing called the,
uh,
the shuffling problem.

35
00:02:12.251 --> 00:02:15.970
Like the naive shuffle that most programmers,
right,
has a huge flaw.

36
00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:19.000
And there's a lot of articles online about this cause it can be really bad if

37
00:02:19.001 --> 00:02:22.330
you're like a casino and you have an unsophisticated program or writing your

38
00:02:22.331 --> 00:02:25.120
shuffle algorithm.
They're surprising ways to get this wrong.

39
00:02:25.121 --> 00:02:26.860
But the neat thing is the way to figure that out.

40
00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:31.420
It's just a runner shuffle a bunch of times and see like how many orientations

41
00:02:31.421 --> 00:02:32.140
of cards you get.

42
00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:35.950
You should get an equal distribution of all the cards and with the naive method

43
00:02:35.951 --> 00:02:38.830
of shuffling,
if you just look at the data,
if you just brute force and say,
okay,

44
00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:41.380
I don't know what's gonna Happen,
um,
you just write,

45
00:02:41.381 --> 00:02:44.830
write a program that does it a billion times and then see what the buckets look

46
00:02:44.831 --> 00:02:46.730
like of the data and the money hall.

47
00:02:46.731 --> 00:02:50.380
The problem is another example of that where you have three doors and somebody

48
00:02:50.381 --> 00:02:52.270
gives you information about another door.

49
00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:55.620
So the correct answer is you should always switch.
And the money hall problem,

50
00:02:55.621 --> 00:02:58.060
which is not intuitive and people,
it freaks people out all the time,
right?

51
00:02:58.061 --> 00:03:02.670
But you can solve with data.
If you write a program that does the money hall,

52
00:03:03.270 --> 00:03:06.820
you know,
game and then never switches than always,
which is just compare,

53
00:03:06.850 --> 00:03:09.670
you would immediately see that you don't have to be smart,
right?

54
00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:11.530
You don't have to figure out the answer algorithmically,

55
00:03:11.531 --> 00:03:13.160
you can just brute forced it out with data and say,

56
00:03:13.161 --> 00:03:16.300
well I know the answer is this because I ran the program a billion times and

57
00:03:16.301 --> 00:03:20.260
these are the data buckets that I got from it.
Right.
So empirically find his,

58
00:03:20.261 --> 00:03:24.410
but it was the joy of that.
What,
so for you,
for you personally,
uh,

59
00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:28.780
outside of family,
what motivates you in this process?

60
00:03:28.870 --> 00:03:32.320
Is felt to be an,
honestly,
I don't really write a lot of code anymore.

61
00:03:32.321 --> 00:03:35.020
Like what I do at discourse is like managery stuff,

62
00:03:35.021 --> 00:03:38.520
which I always kind of despised.
Right?
Like as a programmer,

63
00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:42.030
you think of managers as people who don't really do anything themselves.
Uh,

64
00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:45.550
but the weird thing about code is like,
you realize that like language is code.

65
00:03:45.551 --> 00:03:50.350
Like the ability to direct other people lets you get more stuff than you done

66
00:03:50.351 --> 00:03:53.620
than you could by yourself anyway.
You said language is code,

67
00:03:53.670 --> 00:03:56.770
language is communion.
Communication with other humans.
Yes it is.

68
00:03:56.771 --> 00:04:00.370
You can think of it as a systematic.
So what,
what,
what is it like to be,

69
00:04:01.300 --> 00:04:04.240
what makes,
before we get into programming,
what makes a good manager?

70
00:04:04.300 --> 00:04:06.970
What makes a good leader?
Well,
I think a leader,
it's,

71
00:04:06.971 --> 00:04:08.800
it's all about leading by example.
First of all,

72
00:04:08.801 --> 00:04:12.280
like sort of doing and being the things that you want to be.

73
00:04:12.460 --> 00:04:13.600
Now this can be kind of exhausting,

74
00:04:13.601 --> 00:04:16.630
particularly have kids cause you realize that your kids are watching you like

75
00:04:16.690 --> 00:04:20.590
all the time.
Like even in ways that you've stopped seeing yourself,

76
00:04:20.591 --> 00:04:23.410
like the hardest person to see on the planet.
It's really yourself,
right?

77
00:04:23.570 --> 00:04:26.260
It's a lot of,
you see other people and,
and,
and make judgments about them,

78
00:04:26.261 --> 00:04:28.240
but yourself,
like you're super biased.

79
00:04:28.780 --> 00:04:31.090
You don't actually see yourself the way other people see you as often.

80
00:04:31.100 --> 00:04:31.421
You're very,

81
00:04:31.421 --> 00:04:34.990
very hard on yourself in a way that other people really aren't going to be.
So,

82
00:04:35.200 --> 00:04:37.750
you know,
that's one of the insights is,
you know,

83
00:04:37.751 --> 00:04:39.880
you gotta be really diligent about thinking like,

84
00:04:40.180 --> 00:04:44.740
am I behaving in a way that represents how I want other people to behave?
Right?

85
00:04:44.741 --> 00:04:45.940
Like leading through example.

86
00:04:46.090 --> 00:04:49.300
There's a lot of examples of leaders that really mess this up,
right?

87
00:04:49.301 --> 00:04:52.330
Like they make decisions that are like,
wow,
that's why would you know?
It just,

88
00:04:52.390 --> 00:04:54.940
it's,
it's,
it's a bad example for other people.

89
00:04:54.941 --> 00:04:56.890
So I think leading by example is one,

90
00:04:57.410 --> 00:05:00.670
the other one I believe in is working really hard and I don't mean like working

91
00:05:00.671 --> 00:05:01.510
exhaustively,

92
00:05:01.511 --> 00:05:06.511
but like showing a real passion for the problem.

93
00:05:06.731 --> 00:05:09.010
Like,
you know,
not necessarily your solution to the problem,

94
00:05:09.011 --> 00:05:11.050
but the problem itself has just one that you really believe in.

95
00:05:11.051 --> 00:05:13.960
Like with discourse for example,
the problem that we're looking at,

96
00:05:13.961 --> 00:05:18.670
which is my current project is how do you get people in groups to communicate in

97
00:05:18.671 --> 00:05:21.790
a way that doesn't like break down into the howling of Wolf's,
right?

98
00:05:21.790 --> 00:05:24.900
Like how do you deal with trolling,
not like technical problems,

99
00:05:24.901 --> 00:05:27.490
but how do we get people to post paragraphs?
How do I get people to use bold,

100
00:05:27.491 --> 00:05:30.730
how to get people to use complete sentences.
Although those are problems as well.

101
00:05:30.731 --> 00:05:33.710
But like how do I get people to get along with each other,
right?
Like,
and,

102
00:05:33.711 --> 00:05:36.640
and solve whatever problem it is they set up to solver,
you know,

103
00:05:36.641 --> 00:05:39.980
reached some consensus on discussion or just like not hurt each other even where

104
00:05:39.990 --> 00:05:41.920
like maybe it's a discussion that doesn't really matter,

105
00:05:41.921 --> 00:05:44.260
but are people like yelling at each other.
Right.
And why,
right?

106
00:05:44.261 --> 00:05:48.460
Like that's not the purpose of this kind of communication.
So I would say,

107
00:05:48.490 --> 00:05:52.930
you know,
leadership is about,
you know,
setting an example,
you know,

108
00:05:52.931 --> 00:05:55.570
doing the things that represent what you want to be and making sure that you're

109
00:05:55.571 --> 00:05:56.680
actually doing those things.

110
00:05:56.960 --> 00:06:00.410
And there's a trick to that too because the things you don't do also say a lot

111
00:06:00.411 --> 00:06:01.340
about what you are.

112
00:06:02.370 --> 00:06:05.130
<v 0>Yeah.
So let's pause on that one.
So those two things are fascinating.</v>

113
00:06:05.131 --> 00:06:08.070
So how you have as a leader that self awareness.

114
00:06:08.071 --> 00:06:10.050
So you just said it's really hard to be self aware.

115
00:06:10.200 --> 00:06:14.130
So for you personally or maybe for other leaders you've seen her look up to?

116
00:06:14.190 --> 00:06:19.190
How do you know the both of the things you're doing are the wrong things to be

117
00:06:19.621 --> 00:06:21.390
doing,
the way you speak to others,

118
00:06:21.420 --> 00:06:23.910
the way you behave and the things you're not doing.
How do you,

119
00:06:23.940 --> 00:06:24.940
how do you get that signal?

120
00:06:25.170 --> 00:06:28.470
<v 1>There's two aspects to that.
One is like processing feedback that you're getting.</v>

121
00:06:28.680 --> 00:06:32.250
So how do you get feedback?
Are you getting feedback right?

122
00:06:32.251 --> 00:06:33.270
Like so one way we do it,
for example,

123
00:06:33.271 --> 00:06:37.320
at discourse we have three cofounders and we periodically talk about decisions

124
00:06:37.321 --> 00:06:41.310
before we make them.
So it's not like one person can make a mistake or like wow,

125
00:06:41.311 --> 00:06:43.230
that's,
you know,
there can be misunderstandings,
things like that.

126
00:06:43.231 --> 00:06:46.680
So it's part of like group consensus of leadership is like,
it's good to have,

127
00:06:47.040 --> 00:06:50.340
I think systems where there's one leader and that leader has the rule of

128
00:06:50.341 --> 00:06:54.180
absolute law are just really dangerous.
In my experience for communities,

129
00:06:54.181 --> 00:06:56.160
for example,
like you have a community,
it's run by one person,

130
00:06:56.161 --> 00:06:58.920
that one person makes all the decisions,
that person's going to have a bad day.

131
00:06:59.340 --> 00:07:02.250
Something could happen to that person.
You know,
something,
you know,

132
00:07:02.520 --> 00:07:05.100
there's a lot of variables.
So like at first when you think about leadership,

133
00:07:05.101 --> 00:07:08.760
how have multiple people doing leadership and have them talk amongst each other,

134
00:07:08.990 --> 00:07:12.000
they're giving each other feedback about the decisions that they're making.

135
00:07:12.180 --> 00:07:13.680
And then when you do get feedback,

136
00:07:13.681 --> 00:07:15.870
I think there's that little voice in your head,
right?
Like,

137
00:07:16.290 --> 00:07:19.050
or your gut or wherever you want to put it in your body.
Uh,

138
00:07:19.080 --> 00:07:22.050
I think that voice is really important.

139
00:07:22.350 --> 00:07:25.950
Like I think most people who have any kind of moral compass or like want to do,

140
00:07:25.951 --> 00:07:28.080
most people want to do the right thing.
I do believe that.

141
00:07:28.410 --> 00:07:32.070
I mean there might be a handful of sociopath south that don't,
but most people,

142
00:07:32.550 --> 00:07:35.400
they want other people to think of them as a good person.
And why wouldn't you?

143
00:07:35.401 --> 00:07:37.920
Right?
Like,
do you want people to despise you?
I mean,
that's just weird,
right?

144
00:07:38.040 --> 00:07:39.670
So you have that little voice that sort of the,

145
00:07:39.680 --> 00:07:40.980
the angel and devil on your shoulder,

146
00:07:40.981 --> 00:07:43.470
sort of talking to you about like what you're doing,
how you're doing,

147
00:07:43.471 --> 00:07:45.930
how does it make you feel to make these decisions?
Right.

148
00:07:46.290 --> 00:07:50.770
And I think having some attunement to that voice is important.
But you said that,

149
00:07:50.771 --> 00:07:50.850
yeah.

150
00:07:50.850 --> 00:07:55.140
<v 0>Voice also for,
I think this is a programmer situation too,</v>

151
00:07:55.141 --> 00:07:59.250
where sometimes the devil on the shoulders a little,
a little too loud.

152
00:07:59.700 --> 00:08:01.870
So you'll be a little too self critical.
Uh,

153
00:08:02.010 --> 00:08:05.250
for a lot of developers and especially when you have introverted personality,

154
00:08:05.550 --> 00:08:10.510
how do you struggle with is self criticism of the criticism?
Others?
Uh,

155
00:08:10.620 --> 00:08:13.750
one of the things of leadership is to do something that's potentially an

156
00:08:13.760 --> 00:08:17.670
unpopular or what people doubt you and you still go through with the decision.

157
00:08:18.210 --> 00:08:20.970
So what's that balance like?

158
00:08:21.080 --> 00:08:23.210
<v 1>I think you have to walk people through your decision making,
right?</v>

159
00:08:23.211 --> 00:08:23.610
Like you have to,

160
00:08:23.610 --> 00:08:26.060
this is where blogging is really important and communication is so important.

161
00:08:26.061 --> 00:08:28.100
Again,
code language is just another kind of code.
It's like,

162
00:08:28.460 --> 00:08:32.360
here is the program by which I arrived at the conclusion that I'm going to
reach,

163
00:08:32.361 --> 00:08:36.140
right?
It's one thing to say like,
this is a decision,
it's final deal with it,

164
00:08:36.290 --> 00:08:39.980
right?
That's not usually satisfying to people,
but if you say,
look,
you know,

165
00:08:39.981 --> 00:08:41.270
we've been thinking of this problem for a while,

166
00:08:41.300 --> 00:08:43.850
here's some stuff that's happened.
Here's what we think is right,

167
00:08:44.030 --> 00:08:45.800
here's our goals,
here's what we want achieve,

168
00:08:46.010 --> 00:08:49.460
and we've looked at these options and we think this of the available options is

169
00:08:49.461 --> 00:08:52.040
the best option.
People would be like,
oh,
okay.
All right,

170
00:08:52.041 --> 00:08:53.030
maybe I don't totally agree with you,

171
00:08:53.031 --> 00:08:54.290
but I can kind of see where you're coming from.

172
00:08:54.291 --> 00:08:59.160
And like I see it's just arbitrary decision delivered from a cloud of flames in

173
00:08:59.161 --> 00:09:00.210
the sky,
right?

174
00:09:00.211 --> 00:09:04.470
It's like a human trying to reach some kind of consensus about goals and their

175
00:09:04.471 --> 00:09:06.720
goals might be different than yours.
That's completely legit,
right?

176
00:09:06.721 --> 00:09:09.930
But if you're making that clear,
it's like,
oh,
well the reason we don't agree,

177
00:09:09.931 --> 00:09:12.720
it's because we have totally different goals,
right?
Like how could we agree?

178
00:09:12.840 --> 00:09:14.100
It's not that you're a bad person,

179
00:09:14.101 --> 00:09:17.310
it's that we have radically different goals in mind when we started looking at

180
00:09:17.311 --> 00:09:18.050
this problem.

181
00:09:18.050 --> 00:09:21.770
<v 2>And the other one you said is passion,
so or a hard work,
sorry.
Uh,</v>

182
00:09:22.310 --> 00:09:23.143
well those are tied together

183
00:09:23.410 --> 00:09:25.350
<v 1>in my mind.
Let's say hardware compassion.
Like for me,</v>

184
00:09:25.351 --> 00:09:29.550
like I just really love the problem discourses sending out to solve because in a

185
00:09:29.551 --> 00:09:31.020
way it's like there's a,

186
00:09:31.021 --> 00:09:34.170
there's a vision of the world where it all devolves into Facebook basically

187
00:09:34.171 --> 00:09:37.050
owning everything and every aspect of human communication.
Right.

188
00:09:37.051 --> 00:09:40.680
And this has always been kind of a scary world for me.
Um,
first cause I don't,

189
00:09:40.830 --> 00:09:43.110
I think Facebook is really good at execution.
I've got to compliment them.

190
00:09:43.111 --> 00:09:45.090
They're very competent in terms of what they're doing.

191
00:09:45.390 --> 00:09:49.950
But Facebook has not much of a moral compass in terms of Facebook cares about

192
00:09:49.951 --> 00:09:53.550
Facebook really.
They don't really care about you and your problems.

193
00:09:53.551 --> 00:09:56.490
What they care about is how big they can make Facebook,
right?

194
00:09:56.520 --> 00:09:59.520
Is that you're talking about the company or just the mechanism of how Facebook

195
00:09:59.521 --> 00:10:02.730
works?
Kind of both really,
right?
Like,
and the idea with this course,

196
00:10:02.731 --> 00:10:05.550
the reason I'm so passionate about is because I believe every community should

197
00:10:05.551 --> 00:10:07.110
have the right to own themselves,
right?

198
00:10:07.110 --> 00:10:10.890
Like they should have their own software that they can run that belongs to them,

199
00:10:11.070 --> 00:10:13.740
that's their space where they can set the rules and if they don't like it,

200
00:10:13.741 --> 00:10:16.890
they can move to different hosting or you know,
whatever they need,

201
00:10:17.010 --> 00:10:20.370
they need to happen can happen.
But like this,
this idea of a company town,

202
00:10:20.640 --> 00:10:23.520
we're all human communication is implicitly owned by Whatsapp,

203
00:10:23.550 --> 00:10:26.250
Instagram and Facebook.
And it's really disturbing to,

204
00:10:26.251 --> 00:10:28.140
because Facebook is really smart.
Like I said,

205
00:10:28.141 --> 00:10:30.900
they're great at execution buying and what's happened buying Instagram were

206
00:10:30.901 --> 00:10:34.830
incredibly smart decisions.
Um,
and they also do this thing on if you know,

207
00:10:34.831 --> 00:10:39.030
but they have this VPN software that they give away for free on smartphones and

208
00:10:39.031 --> 00:10:40.420
it indirectly feeds all the,

209
00:10:40.421 --> 00:10:43.980
the data about the traffic back to Facebook so they can see what's actually

210
00:10:43.981 --> 00:10:45.720
getting popular through the VPN,
right?

211
00:10:45.990 --> 00:10:49.950
They have low level access to the network data because users have let them have

212
00:10:49.951 --> 00:10:50.790
that.
So

213
00:10:52.040 --> 00:10:55.350
<v 2>let's,
let's,
uh,
take a small pause here.
First of all,
discourse,</v>

214
00:10:55.380 --> 00:10:56.640
can you talk about,

215
00:10:56.760 --> 00:11:01.760
can you lay out the land of all the different ways you can have communities?

216
00:11:01.891 --> 00:11:04.980
So there's stack overflow that you've built.
There's discourse.

217
00:11:05.280 --> 00:11:09.000
So stack overflow is kind of like a Wiki Wikipedia you talk about,
uh,

218
00:11:09.240 --> 00:11:11.670
and it's a very specific scalpel,
very focused.

219
00:11:11.970 --> 00:11:16.110
So what is the purpose of discourse?
And maybe contrast that with Facebook.

220
00:11:16.111 --> 00:11:19.210
First of all,
say what is discourse?
Yeah,
start from the beginning.

221
00:11:19.300 --> 00:11:22.360
<v 1>Well,
let me start from the very beans.
So stack overflow is very structured.
Wiki,</v>

222
00:11:22.361 --> 00:11:26.200
Sal Q and a for programmers,
right?
And uh,
that was the problem.

223
00:11:26.201 --> 00:11:27.390
We first worked on it when we started.

224
00:11:27.400 --> 00:11:31.150
We thought it was discussions because we looked at like programming forums and

225
00:11:31.510 --> 00:11:33.490
other things,
but we quickly realized we were doing Q and,
a,

226
00:11:33.491 --> 00:11:36.910
which is a very narrow subset of,
of human communication,
right?
Right.

227
00:11:36.960 --> 00:11:38.890
<v 2>Sizes.
So when you start a stack overflow,</v>

228
00:11:38.891 --> 00:11:42.780
you thought you didn't even know the Q and a.
Now he didn't know it would be,

229
00:11:43.330 --> 00:11:43.480
well,

230
00:11:43.480 --> 00:11:45.250
<v 1>we didn't know we did.
We had an idea of like,
okay,</v>

231
00:11:45.251 --> 00:11:48.850
these are things that we see working online.
We had a goal,
right?
Our goal was,
uh,

232
00:11:49.360 --> 00:11:52.930
there was this site experts exchange with a very unfortunate name.
Thank you.

233
00:11:53.080 --> 00:11:54.820
Killing that site.
Yeah,
I know,
right?

234
00:11:54.821 --> 00:11:56.980
Like a lot of people don't remember it anymore,
which is great.

235
00:11:57.130 --> 00:11:59.500
That's the measure of success when people don't remember the thing that you were

236
00:11:59.501 --> 00:12:01.860
trying to replace,
then you've totally one.
Uh,

237
00:12:02.620 --> 00:12:05.620
so it was a place to get answers to programming questions,

238
00:12:05.621 --> 00:12:08.560
but it wasn't clear if it was like focused Q and,
a if it was a discussion.

239
00:12:08.800 --> 00:12:11.650
There were plenty of programming forums so we weren't really sure.
We were like,

240
00:12:11.651 --> 00:12:15.220
okay,
we'll take aspects of Digg and Reddit,
like voting,
we're very important.

241
00:12:15.530 --> 00:12:17.260
A reordering answers based on votes,

242
00:12:17.440 --> 00:12:20.450
wiki style stuff of like being able to edit posts,
not just your post,

243
00:12:20.451 --> 00:12:23.830
but other people supposed to make them better and keep them more up to date,
uh,

244
00:12:23.831 --> 00:12:27.340
ownership of blogging of like,
okay,
this is me.
I'm saying this in my voice.

245
00:12:27.341 --> 00:12:30.310
You know,
this is the stuff that I know and you know,

246
00:12:30.311 --> 00:12:34.600
you get your reputation accrues to you.
Uh,
and it's pure recognition.

247
00:12:34.930 --> 00:12:37.090
So you asked earlier like what motivates programmers?

248
00:12:37.091 --> 00:12:40.070
I think peer recognition motivates them a lot.
Uh,

249
00:12:40.090 --> 00:12:43.330
that was one of the key insights of stack overflow is like recognition from your

250
00:12:43.331 --> 00:12:46.420
peers is why things get done and there's really money necessarily your boss,

251
00:12:46.421 --> 00:12:47.740
but like your peers saying wow,

252
00:12:47.890 --> 00:12:50.440
this person really knows their stuff has a lot of value.

253
00:12:50.441 --> 00:12:53.290
So the reputation system came from that.
Um,

254
00:12:53.320 --> 00:12:57.160
so we were sort of frankensteining a bunch of stuff together in stack overflow

255
00:12:57.161 --> 00:13:01.060
like stuff we had seen working and we knew worked.
Uh,

256
00:13:01.180 --> 00:13:06.040
and that became stack overflow and it over time we realized it wasn't really a

257
00:13:06.041 --> 00:13:08.770
discussion.
It was very focused questions and answers.

258
00:13:08.771 --> 00:13:10.420
There wasn't a lot of room on the page for,

259
00:13:10.830 --> 00:13:13.210
let me talk about this tangential thing.
It was more like,
okay,

260
00:13:13.211 --> 00:13:14.440
is it answering question?

261
00:13:14.800 --> 00:13:18.340
Is it clarifying the question or could it be an alternative answer to the same

262
00:13:18.341 --> 00:13:21.070
question?
Cause there's usually more than one way to do it in program.

263
00:13:21.071 --> 00:13:24.280
There's like say five to 10 ways and one of the patterns we've got into early

264
00:13:24.281 --> 00:13:27.910
almost stack overflow is there are questions where there would be like hundreds

265
00:13:27.911 --> 00:13:30.100
of answers and we're like,
wow,

266
00:13:30.160 --> 00:13:34.570
how can there be a programming question with 500200500 answers?

267
00:13:34.990 --> 00:13:38.140
And we looked at those and we realize those were not really questions in the

268
00:13:38.141 --> 00:13:39.790
traditional sense.
They were discussions.

269
00:13:39.791 --> 00:13:43.810
It was stuff that we allowed early on that we eventually decided wasn't allowed.

270
00:13:43.811 --> 00:13:46.720
Such as what's your favorite programming food?
You know,

271
00:13:46.721 --> 00:13:49.540
what's the funniest programming cartoon you've seen?
Uh,

272
00:13:49.541 --> 00:13:53.380
and we had to sort of backfill once rules about like why isn't this allowed such

273
00:13:53.381 --> 00:13:56.530
as,
is this a real problem you're facing?
Like nobody goes to work and says,
wow,

274
00:13:56.531 --> 00:13:58.970
I can't work because I don't know what the funniest programming cartoonists,

275
00:13:59.070 --> 00:14:02.050
so sorry,
can't compile this code now.
Right?

276
00:14:02.051 --> 00:14:04.360
It's not a real problem you're facing in your job.

277
00:14:04.500 --> 00:14:07.300
If that was run rule and the second,
like,
what can you really learn from that?

278
00:14:07.301 --> 00:14:10.410
It's like what I call accidental learning or reddit style learning where you're

279
00:14:10.411 --> 00:14:12.700
just like,
oh,
I'll just browse some things and oh wow.
You know,

280
00:14:12.701 --> 00:14:15.970
did you know tree frogs only live three years?
I mean,
I,
I just made that up.

281
00:14:15.971 --> 00:14:18.910
I don't know if that's true,
but,
uh,
I didn't really set out to learn that.

282
00:14:18.911 --> 00:14:21.430
I don't need to know that.
Right.
It's an accidental learning.

283
00:14:21.730 --> 00:14:23.950
It was more intentional learning.
We're like,
okay,

284
00:14:23.951 --> 00:14:26.650
I have a problem and I want to learn about stuff around this problem having.

285
00:14:26.860 --> 00:14:29.920
Right.
And it could be theory,
could be compiler theory,
it could be other stuff,

286
00:14:29.950 --> 00:14:34.060
but I'm having a compiler problem.
Hence I need to know the compiler theory,

287
00:14:34.270 --> 00:14:37.780
that aspect of it.
That gives me the,
the gets me to my answer.
Right?

288
00:14:38.080 --> 00:14:39.340
So kind of a directed learning.

289
00:14:39.341 --> 00:14:42.460
So we had a backfill of these rules as we sort of figured out what the heck it

290
00:14:42.461 --> 00:14:45.370
was we were doing.
And the system came very strict over time.

291
00:14:45.371 --> 00:14:46.840
And a lot of people still complain about that.

292
00:14:46.841 --> 00:14:50.050
And I wrote my latest blog entry a what to stack overflow.

293
00:14:50.051 --> 00:14:53.900
One to be wanted to be when it grows out celebrating the 10 year anniversary.

294
00:14:53.901 --> 00:14:57.650
Yeah.
Yeah.
So 10 years and it,
that system has trended towards strictness.

295
00:14:57.680 --> 00:14:58.910
There's a variety of reasons for this.

296
00:14:58.911 --> 00:15:02.630
One is people don't like to see other people get reputation for stuff as they

297
00:15:02.631 --> 00:15:03.980
view,
they view as frivolous,

298
00:15:03.981 --> 00:15:07.540
which I can actually understand because if you saw a program or got like 500 up

299
00:15:07.541 --> 00:15:11.810
votes for funniest programming cartoon or funniest comment they had seen in
code,

300
00:15:11.811 --> 00:15:15.080
it's like well why do they have that reputation is because they wrote the joke.

301
00:15:15.080 --> 00:15:17.870
Probably not.
I mean if they did maybe or the cartoon,
right.

302
00:15:18.260 --> 00:15:20.750
They're getting a bunch of reputation based on someone else's work.

303
00:15:20.780 --> 00:15:24.610
It's not even like programming.
It's just a joke,
right?
It's related to burn.

304
00:15:24.800 --> 00:15:28.040
So you begin to resent that.
You're like,
well that's not fair.
And it isn't.

305
00:15:28.041 --> 00:15:29.120
At some level they're correct.

306
00:15:29.121 --> 00:15:32.030
I mean I empathize cause like it's not correct to get a reputation for that

307
00:15:32.031 --> 00:15:36.980
versus here's a really gnarly regular expression problem and here's a really

308
00:15:37.220 --> 00:15:41.030
clever,
insightful,
you know,
detailed answer laying out,

309
00:15:41.031 --> 00:15:42.710
oh here's why you're seeing the paver that you're saying here.

310
00:15:42.711 --> 00:15:44.870
Let me teach you some things about how to avoid that in the future.
That's,

311
00:15:44.900 --> 00:15:46.370
that's great.
Like that's gold,
right?

312
00:15:46.550 --> 00:15:49.220
You want people to reputation for that and not so much for,
wow,

313
00:15:49.221 --> 00:15:51.320
look at this funny thing.
And I saw,
all right,
great.

314
00:15:51.321 --> 00:15:56.180
So there's this very specific Q and a format and then take me through the

315
00:15:56.181 --> 00:15:58.610
journey towards discourse and Facebook and Twitter.

316
00:15:58.610 --> 00:16:02.990
So you started at the beginning that stack overflow evolve to have a purpose.

317
00:16:03.020 --> 00:16:05.950
So where does this course,
this uh,

318
00:16:05.990 --> 00:16:10.580
passion you have for creating community for discussion?
What,
where does that,

319
00:16:10.610 --> 00:16:12.320
well,
when was that born and hollow?

320
00:16:12.321 --> 00:16:13.940
Part of it is based on the realization of the stack.

321
00:16:13.941 --> 00:16:17.790
Overflow is only good for very specific subjects where there's sort of a,
it's,

322
00:16:17.820 --> 00:16:18.680
it's based on data.

323
00:16:18.681 --> 00:16:22.310
Facts and science were answers can be kind of verified to be true.

324
00:16:22.550 --> 00:16:24.860
Another form of that is there's the book of knowledge,

325
00:16:24.890 --> 00:16:28.550
like the Tome of of knowledge that defines like whatever it is,

326
00:16:28.760 --> 00:16:31.760
you can refer to that book.
And I'll give you the answer.
There has to be,

327
00:16:32.030 --> 00:16:35.510
it only works on subjects where there's like semi clear answers to things that

328
00:16:35.511 --> 00:16:38.270
can be verified in some form.
Um,
now again,

329
00:16:38.271 --> 00:16:39.750
there's always more than one way to do it.
Uh,

330
00:16:39.810 --> 00:16:41.630
there's complete flexibility in the system around that,

331
00:16:41.960 --> 00:16:46.070
but where it falls down as is stuff like poker and Lego like we had,

332
00:16:46.400 --> 00:16:50.720
if you go to stack exchange.com we have an engine that tries to launch different

333
00:16:50.721 --> 00:16:55.580
Q and a topics,
right?
And people can propose a Qa topics,
um,

334
00:16:56.060 --> 00:16:59.120
sample questions and if he gets enough support within the network,

335
00:16:59.121 --> 00:17:00.170
we launched that Qa site.

336
00:17:00.171 --> 00:17:03.410
So some of the ones we launched were poker and Lego and they did horribly,
right?

337
00:17:03.411 --> 00:17:06.890
Because,
um,
I mean they might still be there lingering on in some form,

338
00:17:06.891 --> 00:17:09.080
but it was an experiment.
This is like a test,
right?

339
00:17:09.081 --> 00:17:12.620
In some subjects works super well in the stack engine and some don't.

340
00:17:12.800 --> 00:17:16.040
But the reason Lego and poker don't work is because they're so social.
Really.

341
00:17:16.041 --> 00:17:20.420
It's not about,
you know,
what's the rule here in poker?
It's like,
well,
you know,

342
00:17:20.421 --> 00:17:24.200
what kind of cigars do we like to smoke while playing poker?
Or you know,
what's,

343
00:17:24.410 --> 00:17:27.650
what's a cool set of cards to use when I'm playing poker?
Or you know,

344
00:17:27.710 --> 00:17:30.860
what some strategies like say I have this hand come up with some strategies I

345
00:17:30.861 --> 00:17:33.980
could use.
It's more of a discussion around like what's happening?
Like with Lego,

346
00:17:34.010 --> 00:17:36.020
you know,
same thing.
Like here's this cool lego set I found.

347
00:17:36.021 --> 00:17:38.360
Look how awesome this isn't like,
yeah,
that's freaking awesome,
right?

348
00:17:38.510 --> 00:17:39.890
It's not a question,
right?

349
00:17:39.891 --> 00:17:42.920
There's all these social components that discussions that don't fit at all.

350
00:17:43.010 --> 00:17:45.500
Like we literally have to just allow those in stack overflow kids.

351
00:17:45.501 --> 00:17:46.490
It's not about being social,

352
00:17:46.491 --> 00:17:50.340
it's about problems that you're facing in your work that you need concrete

353
00:17:50.341 --> 00:17:51.360
answers for.
Right?

354
00:17:51.361 --> 00:17:53.730
Like you have a real demonstrated problem that sort of blocking you and

355
00:17:53.731 --> 00:17:55.830
something nobody is blocked by.
You know,

356
00:17:55.831 --> 00:17:57.990
what should I do when I have a straight flush,
right?

357
00:17:57.990 --> 00:18:00.060
Like started walking problem in the world.

358
00:18:00.450 --> 00:18:02.340
It's just an opportunity to hang out and discuss.

359
00:18:02.341 --> 00:18:06.330
So discourse was a way to address that and say,
look,
you know,

360
00:18:06.450 --> 00:18:10.680
a discussion forum software ha was very,
very bad.

361
00:18:10.710 --> 00:18:14.160
And when I came out of stack overflow in late twenties,
early twenties,

362
00:18:14.610 --> 00:18:19.080
early 2013 or early 2012,
um,
it was still very,

363
00:18:19.081 --> 00:18:22.800
very bad.
I expected it,
it improved in the four years since I last looked,

364
00:18:22.801 --> 00:18:24.990
but it had not improved at all.
And I was like,

365
00:18:24.991 --> 00:18:29.430
well that's kind of terrible because I love these communities of people talking

366
00:18:29.431 --> 00:18:32.670
about things that they love.
You know,
that they're just communities of interest,

367
00:18:32.671 --> 00:18:34.380
right?
And there's no good software for them.

368
00:18:34.560 --> 00:18:38.730
Like startups would come to me and say,
Hey Jeff,
I want to,
you know,

369
00:18:38.780 --> 00:18:41.430
I have this startup,
here's my idea.
And I,

370
00:18:41.470 --> 00:18:43.980
the first thing I would say that it was like,
well first,
why are you asking me?

371
00:18:43.980 --> 00:18:47.280
Like,
I don't really know your,
your field,
right.
US sincerely.
Like,

372
00:18:47.460 --> 00:18:48.990
why aren't you asking like the community,

373
00:18:48.991 --> 00:18:51.060
like the people that are interested in this problem,

374
00:18:51.270 --> 00:18:53.730
the people that are using your product,
why aren't you talking to them?

375
00:18:53.970 --> 00:18:56.130
And then they'd say,
oh,
great idea.
Like how do I do that?

376
00:18:56.131 --> 00:18:58.930
And then that's when I started playing sad trombone because I realized all the

377
00:18:58.931 --> 00:19:03.300
software involving talking to your users,
customers,
audience,
patrons,

378
00:19:03.301 --> 00:19:05.340
whatever it is,
it was all really bad.
You know,

379
00:19:05.341 --> 00:19:08.160
it was like stuff that I would be embarrassed to recommend to other people.

380
00:19:08.340 --> 00:19:11.670
And yet that's where I felt they could get the biggest and strongest,

381
00:19:11.671 --> 00:19:15.570
most effective input for what they should be doing with their product.
Right.

382
00:19:15.571 --> 00:19:17.490
It's from their users,
from their community.
Right.

383
00:19:17.491 --> 00:19:18.600
That's what we did on stack overflow.

384
00:19:18.620 --> 00:19:23.460
<v 2>Oh,
so what we're talking about with forms,
the,
what is it,</v>

385
00:19:23.490 --> 00:19:26.790
the dark matter of the Internet?
Uh,
it's still,
I don't know if it's still,

386
00:19:26.791 --> 00:19:31.791
but for the longest time it has some of the most passionate and fascinating

387
00:19:32.071 --> 00:19:36.150
discussions.
And what's the usual structure?
There's usually what?
It's a,

388
00:19:36.151 --> 00:19:38.010
it's linear,
so sequential.

389
00:19:38.130 --> 00:19:42.130
She posts one after the other and there's paging nation.
So it's every,

390
00:19:42.750 --> 00:19:45.000
there's a 10 posts and you go to the next page.

391
00:19:45.001 --> 00:19:49.020
And that format still is used by,
like,
I'm a,

392
00:19:49.021 --> 00:19:52.740
we're doing a lot of research with Tesla of vehicles and there's a Tesla Motors

393
00:19:52.741 --> 00:19:54.250
club forum,
which is extreme,

394
00:19:54.260 --> 00:19:57.660
really wanted to run that actually they pinged us about,
I don't think we got it,

395
00:19:57.661 --> 00:19:58.860
but I really would have liked to gotten that one.

396
00:19:59.190 --> 00:20:02.820
But they've started before even 2012 I believe.
I mean,

397
00:20:02.821 --> 00:20:04.080
they've been running for a long time.

398
00:20:04.140 --> 00:20:06.810
It's still an extremely rich source of information.

399
00:20:06.811 --> 00:20:11.670
So what's broken about that system and how you're trying to fix it?

400
00:20:12.360 --> 00:20:14.570
<v 1>I think there's a lot of power in,</v>

401
00:20:14.580 --> 00:20:19.170
in connecting people that love the same stuff around that specific topic.

402
00:20:19.171 --> 00:20:23.460
Meaning Facebook's idea of connection is just any human that's related to

403
00:20:23.461 --> 00:20:27.360
another human right.
Like,
like through friendship or,
you know,
any other reason?

404
00:20:27.420 --> 00:20:30.420
Facebook's idea of the world is sort of the,
the status update,
right?

405
00:20:30.421 --> 00:20:34.750
Like a friend of yours did something ate at a restaurant,
right.
Um,

406
00:20:34.950 --> 00:20:38.430
whereas discussion forums were additionally around the interest graph.
Like,

407
00:20:38.431 --> 00:20:41.930
I love electric cars specifically.
I Love Tesla,
right?

408
00:20:41.950 --> 00:20:45.690
Like I love the way they approach the problem.
I love the style of the founder.

409
00:20:45.870 --> 00:20:49.300
I just love the,
the design ethic and there's a lot to like about Tesla.

410
00:20:49.301 --> 00:20:50.200
If you saw the oatmeal,

411
00:20:50.201 --> 00:20:54.100
he did a whole love comic to Tesla and it was actually kind of cool because I

412
00:20:54.101 --> 00:20:54.671
learned some stuff.

413
00:20:54.671 --> 00:20:57.460
He was saying how great Tesla cars where it specifically like how they were

414
00:20:57.461 --> 00:20:59.830
built differently and he went into a lot of great detail.

415
00:20:59.830 --> 00:21:02.620
That was really interesting to me.
That oatmeal post,
if you read it,

416
00:21:02.621 --> 00:21:05.380
is the genesis of pretty much all interest communities.

417
00:21:05.710 --> 00:21:08.380
I just really love this stuff.
So like for me for example,
there's Yoyos,
right?

418
00:21:08.381 --> 00:21:11.320
Like I'm into the Yoyo communities and there's these interests.

419
00:21:11.321 --> 00:21:14.450
Communities are just really fascinating to me and I feel more connected to the

420
00:21:14.451 --> 00:21:18.370
Yoyo communities than I do to,
you know,
friends that I don't see that often.

421
00:21:18.371 --> 00:21:18.611
Right?

422
00:21:18.611 --> 00:21:23.500
Like to me the powerful thing is the interest graph and Facebook kind of dabbles

423
00:21:23.501 --> 00:21:24.490
in the interest graph.

424
00:21:24.970 --> 00:21:26.950
I mean they have groups you can sign up for groups and stuff,

425
00:21:26.951 --> 00:21:30.940
but it's really about the relationship graph.
Like I,
I,
this is my coworker,

426
00:21:30.941 --> 00:21:35.230
this is my relative,
this is my friend.
Um,
but not so much about the interest.

427
00:21:35.231 --> 00:21:36.130
So I think that's the,

428
00:21:36.131 --> 00:21:39.310
the linchpin of which forums and communities are built on that.

429
00:21:39.310 --> 00:21:44.170
I personally love.
Like I,
I,
I,
like I said,
leadership is about passion,
right?

430
00:21:44.171 --> 00:21:45.730
And being passionate about stuff is,

431
00:21:46.090 --> 00:21:49.080
it's a really valid way to look at the world and I think it's a way,
um,

432
00:21:49.780 --> 00:21:52.750
a lot of stuff in the world gets done.
Like I want send,
someone described me as,

433
00:21:52.930 --> 00:21:53.501
he's like,
Jeff,

434
00:21:53.501 --> 00:21:57.640
you're a guy who you just get super passionate about a few things at a time and

435
00:21:57.641 --> 00:22:00.160
you just go super cheap from those things.
And I was like,
oh,

436
00:22:00.161 --> 00:22:01.360
that's kind of right.
That's kind of what I do.

437
00:22:01.361 --> 00:22:04.120
I'll get into something and just be super into that for a couple of years or

438
00:22:04.121 --> 00:22:08.250
whatever and just learn all I can about it and go super deep in it.
And,
uh,

439
00:22:08.260 --> 00:22:11.110
that's how I enjoy experiencing the world,
right?
Like,

440
00:22:11.111 --> 00:22:12.340
not being shallow on a bunch of things,

441
00:22:12.341 --> 00:22:15.040
but being really deep on a few things that I'm interested in.

442
00:22:15.280 --> 00:22:18.070
So forums kind of unlocked that.
Right?
And you know,

443
00:22:18.071 --> 00:22:20.860
you don't want a world where everything belongs to Facebook,
at least.
I don't,

444
00:22:20.861 --> 00:22:23.460
I want a world where communities can kind of own themselves,
set their own norm,

445
00:22:23.461 --> 00:22:26.260
set their own rules,
um,
control the experience.

446
00:22:26.261 --> 00:22:29.650
Cause Com community is also about ownership,
right?
Like if,

447
00:22:29.680 --> 00:22:32.710
if you're meeting at the Barnes and noble every Thursday and Barnes and noble

448
00:22:32.711 --> 00:22:35.710
says,
get Outta here,
you guys don't buy enough books.
Well,
you know,

449
00:22:35.711 --> 00:22:38.560
you're kind of hosed,
right?
Barnes and noble owns you,
right?
Like you can't,

450
00:22:38.830 --> 00:22:41.340
but if you have your own meeting space,
you know,
your own clubhouse,

451
00:22:41.380 --> 00:22:42.670
you can set your own rules,

452
00:22:43.000 --> 00:22:47.170
decide what you want to talk about there and just really generate a lot better

453
00:22:47.171 --> 00:22:48.100
information than you could.

454
00:22:48.101 --> 00:22:51.770
It's like hanging out at Barnes and noble every Thursday at 3:00 PM.
Right?
Uh,

455
00:22:51.810 --> 00:22:55.300
so that's kind of the vision of discourse is a place where it's,

456
00:22:55.301 --> 00:22:57.940
it's fully open source.
You can take the software,

457
00:22:57.941 --> 00:22:59.800
you can saw it anywhere and you know,

458
00:22:59.830 --> 00:23:02.810
you and a group of people can go deep on whatever it is that you're into.

459
00:23:02.811 --> 00:23:04.390
And this works for startups,
right?

460
00:23:04.391 --> 00:23:07.990
Startups are a group of people who go super deep on a specific problem,
right?

461
00:23:08.350 --> 00:23:10.750
And they want to talk to the comedian.
It's like wall installed this course,

462
00:23:10.751 --> 00:23:13.300
right?
That's what we do at this course.
That's what I did.
A stack overflow.

463
00:23:13.510 --> 00:23:15.460
I spent a lot of time on metastatic overflow,

464
00:23:15.461 --> 00:23:20.461
which is our internal well public community feedback site and uh,

465
00:23:21.400 --> 00:23:24.090
just experiencing what the users were experiencing,
right?

466
00:23:24.091 --> 00:23:26.830
Cause they're the ones doing all the work in the system and they had a lot of

467
00:23:26.831 --> 00:23:29.080
interesting feedback and there's that 90 10 rules,

468
00:23:29.081 --> 00:23:32.320
like 90% of the feedback you get is not really actionable for writing reasons.

469
00:23:32.321 --> 00:23:34.570
It might be bad feedback,
it might be crazy feedback.

470
00:23:34.570 --> 00:23:36.160
It might be feedback you just can act on right now.

471
00:23:36.310 --> 00:23:38.170
But there's 10% of it that's like gold.

472
00:23:38.260 --> 00:23:40.480
It's like literally gold and diamonds where it's like feedback,

473
00:23:40.660 --> 00:23:44.770
really good improvements to your core product that are not super hard to get to

474
00:23:44.771 --> 00:23:45.680
and actually make a lot of sense.

475
00:23:45.920 --> 00:23:48.830
And my favorite is about 5% of those stuff I didn't even see coming.
It's like,

476
00:23:48.831 --> 00:23:52.100
oh my God,
I never even thought of that.
But that's a brilliant idea.
Right?

477
00:23:52.520 --> 00:23:55.400
And I can point to so many features of stack overflow that we drive from

478
00:23:55.401 --> 00:23:57.980
metastatic overflow feedback and Mehta discourse,
right?

479
00:23:57.981 --> 00:24:00.650
Same exact principle at discourse.
You know,

480
00:24:01.190 --> 00:24:02.820
we're getting ideas from the comedian.
I was like,
oh my God,

481
00:24:02.830 --> 00:24:04.610
I'd never thought of that.
But that's fantastic.
Right?

482
00:24:04.611 --> 00:24:08.150
Like I love that relationship with the community from having built these

483
00:24:08.151 --> 00:24:11.060
communities.
What have you,
what have you learned about,

484
00:24:11.061 --> 00:24:14.090
what's the process of getting a critical mass of members in the community?

485
00:24:14.120 --> 00:24:18.100
Is it luck,
skill,
timing,
persistence?
What is,
uh,

486
00:24:18.300 --> 00:24:21.860
is it the tools like discourse that empower that community?

487
00:24:21.861 --> 00:24:26.780
Wha what's the key aspect of starting for one guy or Gal and then building it to

488
00:24:26.781 --> 00:24:29.300
two and then 10 and a hundred and a thousand so on.

489
00:24:29.960 --> 00:24:34.190
I think we are starting with an n of one.
I mean I think it's persistence and,

490
00:24:34.250 --> 00:24:38.660
and also you have to be interesting,
like somebody I really admire once,

491
00:24:38.661 --> 00:24:40.580
that's something that I always liked about blogging and he's like,

492
00:24:40.730 --> 00:24:41.570
here's how you blog.

493
00:24:41.810 --> 00:24:45.440
You have to have something interesting to say and have an interesting way of

494
00:24:45.441 --> 00:24:48.770
saying it.
Right?
Yeah.
And then do that for like 10 years.

495
00:24:49.850 --> 00:24:53.330
So that's the genesis is like you have to have sort of something interesting to

496
00:24:53.331 --> 00:24:55.250
say.
That's not exactly what everyone else is saying.

497
00:24:55.251 --> 00:24:56.390
And an interesting way of saying it,

498
00:24:56.391 --> 00:24:58.430
which is another way of saying kind of entertaining way of saying it.

499
00:24:59.240 --> 00:25:02.150
And then as far as growing it,
it's like ritual.
You know,

500
00:25:02.151 --> 00:25:05.130
like you have to like say you're starting a blog,
you have to say,
look,

501
00:25:05.131 --> 00:25:07.550
I'm going to blog every week three times a week,

502
00:25:07.910 --> 00:25:09.590
and you have to stick to that schedule,
right.

503
00:25:09.920 --> 00:25:12.830
Because until you do that for like several years,

504
00:25:12.831 --> 00:25:14.330
you're never gonna get anywhere.

505
00:25:14.331 --> 00:25:16.670
Like it just takes years to get where you need to get to.

506
00:25:16.671 --> 00:25:20.450
And part of that is having the discipline to stick with a schedule and it helps

507
00:25:20.451 --> 00:25:22.670
again,
if it's something you're passionate about,
this won't feel like work.

508
00:25:22.700 --> 00:25:26.470
Like I love this.
I could talk about this all day,
every day.
Right?
Uh,

509
00:25:26.750 --> 00:25:28.520
you just have to do it in a way that's interesting to other people.

510
00:25:28.700 --> 00:25:30.430
And then as you're growing the community,
um,

511
00:25:30.590 --> 00:25:33.560
that pattern of participation within the community of like generating these

512
00:25:33.561 --> 00:25:36.470
artifacts and inviting other people to help you like collaborate on these

513
00:25:36.471 --> 00:25:38.240
artifacts.
Like even in the case of blogging,

514
00:25:38.241 --> 00:25:40.850
like I felt early in the early days of my blog,

515
00:25:40.851 --> 00:25:43.700
which I started in 2004 which is really the genesis of stack overflow.

516
00:25:43.701 --> 00:25:46.580
If you look at all my blog,
it leads up to stack overflow,
which was,

517
00:25:46.820 --> 00:25:48.410
I have all this energy in my blog,

518
00:25:48.411 --> 00:25:51.590
but I don't like 40,000 people were subscribing to me.
And I was like,

519
00:25:51.591 --> 00:25:54.110
I want to do something.
And then I met Joel and said,
Hey Joel,

520
00:25:54.111 --> 00:25:57.320
I want to do something,
take this ball of energy for my blog and do something.

521
00:25:57.321 --> 00:26:00.530
And all the people reading my blog saw that's like,
oh cool,
you're involving us.

522
00:26:00.531 --> 00:26:03.230
You're saying,
look,
you're part of this community,

523
00:26:03.290 --> 00:26:05.450
let's build this thing together.
Like they picked the name,

524
00:26:05.451 --> 00:26:07.940
like we voted on the name for stack overflow on my blog,

525
00:26:08.000 --> 00:26:10.570
like we came up and naming is super hard for slight,

526
00:26:10.910 --> 00:26:13.220
the hardest problem in computer science is coming with a good name for stuff.

527
00:26:13.220 --> 00:26:15.800
Right?
Yeah.
Um,
but there you can go back to my log.

528
00:26:15.801 --> 00:26:19.190
There's the pole where we voted and stack overflow became the name of the site

529
00:26:19.191 --> 00:26:21.330
and all the early Beta users or stack overflow were,

530
00:26:21.390 --> 00:26:25.520
were audience of my blog plus Joel's blog.
Right?
So we started from like,

531
00:26:25.521 --> 00:26:28.490
if you look at the genesis of,
Hey,
I was just a programmer who said,
hey,

532
00:26:28.700 --> 00:26:30.950
I love programming but I have no outlet to talk about it.

533
00:26:30.951 --> 00:26:33.380
So I'm just gonna blog about it because I don't have enough people to work to

534
00:26:33.381 --> 00:26:36.590
talk to about it.
Because at the time I worked at place where,
you know,

535
00:26:36.591 --> 00:26:40.460
programming wasn't the core output of the company was a pharmaceutical company.

536
00:26:40.790 --> 00:26:44.130
And I just love this stuff.
You know,
to an absurd degree.
So I was like,

537
00:26:44.131 --> 00:26:47.010
I'll just blog about it and then I'll find an audience and eventually found an

538
00:26:47.011 --> 00:26:48.750
audience,
eventually found Joel,

539
00:26:48.990 --> 00:26:52.830
and eventually build stack overflow from that one core of,
of activity.
Right?

540
00:26:52.831 --> 00:26:56.730
But it was that repetition of feeding back in feedback from my blog comments,

541
00:26:56.731 --> 00:27:00.720
feedback from Joel,
feedback from the early stack overflow community.

542
00:27:01.410 --> 00:27:04.110
When people see that you're doing that,
they will follow along with you,
right?

543
00:27:04.111 --> 00:27:06.210
There's like a cool,
you're here in good faith.
You're actually,
you know,

544
00:27:06.330 --> 00:27:09.000
not listening to everything because that's impossible.
That's impossible.

545
00:27:09.240 --> 00:27:13.780
But you're actually,
you know,
waiting our feedback and what you're doing because,

546
00:27:14.020 --> 00:27:18.270
and why wouldn't I?
Because who does all the work on stack overflow?
Me,
Joel.
No,

547
00:27:18.271 --> 00:27:20.490
it's the other programmers that are doing all the work.

548
00:27:20.491 --> 00:27:24.840
So you've got to have some respect for that.
And then,
you know,
discipline around,

549
00:27:24.841 --> 00:27:27.240
look,
you know,
we're trying to do a very specific thing here on stack overflow.

550
00:27:27.250 --> 00:27:28.830
We're not trying to solve all the world's problems.

551
00:27:29.070 --> 00:27:32.130
We're trying to solve this very specific Q and a problem in a very specific way.

552
00:27:32.310 --> 00:27:33.540
Not because we're jerks about it,

553
00:27:33.541 --> 00:27:38.100
but because these strict set of rules help us get really good results.

554
00:27:38.101 --> 00:27:40.080
Right.
Um,
and programmers,

555
00:27:40.081 --> 00:27:42.780
that's an easy sell for the most part because programs are used to dealing with

556
00:27:42.810 --> 00:27:46.320
ridiculous systems of rules like constantly,
that's basically their job.

557
00:27:46.710 --> 00:27:50.030
So they're,
they're very,
oh yeah.
Super strict system of rules that lets me get,

558
00:27:50.050 --> 00:27:53.250
I want that's programming,
right?
That's what stack overflow is.
So,

559
00:27:53.640 --> 00:27:57.960
so you making it sound easy,
but in 2004,
let's go back there.

560
00:27:57.961 --> 00:28:02.640
In 2004,
you started the blog I'm quoting or was it called that at the beginning?

561
00:28:02.650 --> 00:28:04.740
Just at the very beginning was one of the smart things I did.

562
00:28:04.760 --> 00:28:06.690
It's from a book by Steve Mcconnell Code Complete,

563
00:28:06.691 --> 00:28:08.210
which is one of my favorite programming books.

564
00:28:08.220 --> 00:28:11.600
Still probably my number one programming book for anyone to read.
Uh,

565
00:28:12.060 --> 00:28:13.800
one of the smart things I did back then,

566
00:28:13.801 --> 00:28:17.190
I don't always do smart things when I start stuff.
I contacted Steven said,
hey,

567
00:28:17.191 --> 00:28:21.510
I really like this.
Uh,
it was a sidebar illustration indicating danger in code,

568
00:28:21.540 --> 00:28:23.670
right?
Coding horror was like,
watch out.

569
00:28:25.290 --> 00:28:27.900
And I love that illustration because it spoke to me because I saw that

570
00:28:27.901 --> 00:28:31.020
illustration go,
oh my God,
that's me.
Like I'm always my own worst enemy.

571
00:28:31.021 --> 00:28:34.260
Like that's the key insight in programming is every time you write something

572
00:28:34.261 --> 00:28:39.150
think,
how am I going to screw myself?
Because you will constantly,
right?

573
00:28:39.180 --> 00:28:41.070
So that the icon was like,
Oh yeah,

574
00:28:41.071 --> 00:28:43.800
I need to constantly hold that mirror up and look and say,
look,

575
00:28:44.130 --> 00:28:46.350
you're very fallible.
You're going to screw this up.

576
00:28:46.351 --> 00:28:50.040
Like how can you build this in such a way that you're not going to screw it up

577
00:28:50.041 --> 00:28:54.420
later?
Like how can you get that discipline around making sure at every step I'm

578
00:28:54.421 --> 00:28:56.880
thinking through all the things that I could do wrong or the other people could

579
00:28:56.881 --> 00:28:57.210
do wrong.

580
00:28:57.210 --> 00:29:00.060
Because that is actually how you get to be a better programmer a lot of times.

581
00:29:00.061 --> 00:29:03.360
Right.
So that sidebar illustration,
I loved it so much.

582
00:29:03.430 --> 00:29:05.850
I wrote Steve before I started my blog and said,
hey,

583
00:29:05.851 --> 00:29:08.040
can I have permission to use this?
Cause I just really like this illustration.

584
00:29:08.430 --> 00:29:11.250
And Steve was kind enough to give me permission to do that.

585
00:29:11.251 --> 00:29:14.130
And She just continues to give me permission.
So you know,
really.
That's awesome.

586
00:29:14.390 --> 00:29:19.110
Uh,
but in 2004 you started this blog,
you know,

587
00:29:19.111 --> 00:29:24.111
you look at a Stephen King book on writing or Steven Pressfield's war of art

588
00:29:25.651 --> 00:29:30.150
book.
I mean,
it seems like writers suffer.
I mean,

589
00:29:30.151 --> 00:29:33.960
it's a hard process of writing,
right?
It's like there's going to be suffering.

590
00:29:34.140 --> 00:29:36.360
I mean,
I won't hit you like,
well the work is suffering,
right?

591
00:29:36.361 --> 00:29:39.000
Like doing the work.
Like even when you're,
every week you're like,
okay,

592
00:29:39.001 --> 00:29:41.800
that blog post wasn't very good.
Or you know,
people didn't like it or people,

593
00:29:41.830 --> 00:29:46.270
right.
Said disparaging things about it.
You have to like have the attitudes,
like,

594
00:29:46.540 --> 00:29:49.420
you know,
no matter what happens,
I want to do this for me.
Right.

595
00:29:49.421 --> 00:29:51.640
It's not about you,
it's about me.
I mean,

596
00:29:51.700 --> 00:29:55.000
in the end it is about everyone because this is how good work gets out into the

597
00:29:55.001 --> 00:29:59.260
world.
But you have to be pretty strict about saying like,

598
00:29:59.710 --> 00:30:03.400
you know,
I'm selfish in the sense that I have to do this for me.
You know,

599
00:30:03.401 --> 00:30:05.410
you mentioned Stephen King,
like his book on writing,

600
00:30:05.411 --> 00:30:07.800
but like one of the things I do for example,
when,
when writing is like I,

601
00:30:07.801 --> 00:30:08.621
I read it out loud.

602
00:30:08.621 --> 00:30:12.990
One of the best pieces of advice for writing anything is read it out loud like

603
00:30:13.000 --> 00:30:16.960
multiple times and make it sound like you're talking because that is the goal of

604
00:30:16.961 --> 00:30:19.450
good writing.
It should sound like you said it with,

605
00:30:19.480 --> 00:30:21.820
with slightly better phrasing because you have to more time to think about what

606
00:30:21.821 --> 00:30:23.950
you're saying.
But like it should sound natural when you say it.

607
00:30:24.310 --> 00:30:27.440
And I think that's probably the single best writing advice and give anyone,

608
00:30:27.441 --> 00:30:29.470
it's just,
just read it over and over,
out loud.

609
00:30:29.710 --> 00:30:33.310
Make sure it sounds like something you would normally say and it sounds good.

610
00:30:33.610 --> 00:30:35.560
And what's your process of writing?

611
00:30:35.561 --> 00:30:40.120
So there's usually a pretty good idea behind the blog post.
So ideas,
right?

612
00:30:40.121 --> 00:30:45.121
So I think you gotta have the concept that there's so many interesting things in

613
00:30:45.731 --> 00:30:49.530
the world.
Like,
I mean my God,
the world is amazing,
right?
Like it's,

614
00:30:49.620 --> 00:30:52.720
you can never write about everything that's going on cause it's so incredible.

615
00:30:52.721 --> 00:30:56.440
But if you can't come up with like let's say one interesting thing per day to

616
00:30:56.441 --> 00:30:57.040
talk about,

617
00:30:57.040 --> 00:30:59.980
then you're not trying hard enough because the world is full of just super

618
00:30:59.981 --> 00:31:01.970
interesting stuff.
And one great way to,

619
00:31:01.971 --> 00:31:05.380
to like mind stuff is go back to old books because they bring up old stuff

620
00:31:05.381 --> 00:31:06.700
that's still super relevant.

621
00:31:07.150 --> 00:31:10.000
And I did that a lot because I was like reading classic programming books and a

622
00:31:10.001 --> 00:31:12.070
lot of the early blog posts were like,
oh,
I was reading this program,

623
00:31:12.071 --> 00:31:14.470
but can they brought this really cool concept and I want to talk about it some

624
00:31:14.471 --> 00:31:17.230
more.
And you get the,
I mean,
you're not claiming credit for the idea,

625
00:31:17.231 --> 00:31:19.540
but it gives you something interesting to talk about that's kind of evergreen,

626
00:31:19.541 --> 00:31:21.910
right?
Like you don't have to go,
what should I talk about it?

627
00:31:21.920 --> 00:31:25.840
So we'll just go dig up some old classic programming books and find something

628
00:31:25.841 --> 00:31:28.090
that,
oh wow,
that's interesting.
Or how does that apply today?

629
00:31:28.091 --> 00:31:30.880
Or what about x and y?
Or compare these two concepts.

630
00:31:30.910 --> 00:31:34.690
So pull a couple of sentences from that book and then a sort of play off of it.

631
00:31:34.910 --> 00:31:39.600
Yeah,
I agree or disagree that,
so in 2007,
uh,

632
00:31:39.610 --> 00:31:44.110
you wrote that you are offered a significant amount of money to sell the blog.

633
00:31:44.410 --> 00:31:48.940
He chose not to.
What were all the elements you were thinking about?

634
00:31:48.941 --> 00:31:50.260
Cause I'd like to take you back,

635
00:31:50.500 --> 00:31:53.830
it seems like there's a lot of nonlinear decisions you made to life.
Uh,

636
00:31:54.310 --> 00:31:56.940
so what was that decision like?
Right,
so I,

637
00:31:57.040 --> 00:31:59.350
one of the things I love is the choose your own adventure books,

638
00:31:59.351 --> 00:32:01.900
which I loved as a kid and I feel like their early programmer books cause

639
00:32:01.901 --> 00:32:04.030
they're,
they're all about if then statements,
right?

640
00:32:04.031 --> 00:32:07.240
If this then this and they're also very,
very unforgiving.

641
00:32:07.241 --> 00:32:09.520
Like there's all these sites that map the,
the,

642
00:32:09.530 --> 00:32:12.350
the classic choose your adventure books and how many outcomes are bad.

643
00:32:12.400 --> 00:32:15.280
It was a lot of bad outcomes.
So part of the game it's like,

644
00:32:15.310 --> 00:32:17.830
oh I got a bad outcome and go back one step,
go back one further steps.

645
00:32:17.830 --> 00:32:19.150
Like how did I get here?
Right?

646
00:32:19.151 --> 00:32:23.170
Like it's a sequence of decisions and this is true of life,
right?

647
00:32:23.171 --> 00:32:26.670
Like every decision is a sequence,
right?
Individually,

648
00:32:27.360 --> 00:32:29.470
any individual Cision is necessarily right or wrong,
but they,

649
00:32:29.480 --> 00:32:32.760
the lead you down a path,
right?
So I do think there's some truth that,

650
00:32:32.770 --> 00:32:36.310
so this particular decision,
uh,
the blog had gotten fairly popular.

651
00:32:36.311 --> 00:32:40.700
There's a lot of RSS readers that I discovered and this guy contacted me out of

652
00:32:40.701 --> 00:32:42.710
the blue from this like bug tracking companies like,
oh,

653
00:32:42.711 --> 00:32:46.010
I really want to buy your blog for like,
I think it was round,

654
00:32:46.070 --> 00:32:49.450
it was $100,000 maybe to like 80,000 but it was,
it was a lot,
right?
Like,

655
00:32:49.460 --> 00:32:51.110
and that's,
you know,
at the time,

656
00:32:51.111 --> 00:32:53.990
like I would have a year's worth of salary all at once.

657
00:32:54.380 --> 00:32:57.140
So I really think about like,
well,
you know,

658
00:32:57.710 --> 00:32:59.210
and I remember talking to people at the time,
it's like,
wow,

659
00:32:59.211 --> 00:33:02.000
that's a lot of money,
but then I don't even,
like,
I really liked my blog,
right?

660
00:33:02.000 --> 00:33:02.241
Like,

661
00:33:02.241 --> 00:33:05.360
do I want to sell my blog because they wouldn't really belong to me anymore at

662
00:33:05.361 --> 00:33:09.350
that point.
And one of the guidelines that I like to,

663
00:33:09.351 --> 00:33:11.000
I don't like to give advice to people a lot,

664
00:33:11.001 --> 00:33:12.500
but one of the pieces of advice I do give,

665
00:33:12.501 --> 00:33:16.490
cause I do think it's really true and it's generally helpful is whenever you're

666
00:33:16.520 --> 00:33:19.490
looking at a set of decisions like,
Oh gosh,
should I do a,
B or c,

667
00:33:19.850 --> 00:33:24.260
you got to pick the thing that's a little scarier in that list because not,

668
00:33:24.290 --> 00:33:25.670
you know,
not like jump off a cliff.
Scary.

669
00:33:25.671 --> 00:33:28.640
But the thing that makes you nervous because if you pick the safe choice,

670
00:33:28.940 --> 00:33:31.340
it's usually you're not really pushing,
you're not pushing yourself.

671
00:33:31.341 --> 00:33:34.490
You're not choosing the thing that's going to help you grow.
So for me,

672
00:33:34.491 --> 00:33:36.710
the scarier choice was to say no.
I was like,
well,
no,

673
00:33:36.711 --> 00:33:39.750
let's just see where this is going,
right?
Because then I own it.
I mean,

674
00:33:39.751 --> 00:33:43.250
it belongs to me.
It's my thing.
Uh,
and I can just take it and,

675
00:33:43.251 --> 00:33:45.290
and tell them some other logical conclusion,
right?

676
00:33:45.291 --> 00:33:48.650
Because imagine how different the world would have been had I said yes and sold

677
00:33:48.651 --> 00:33:51.470
the blog.
It's like they're probably wouldn't be stack overflow.
Uh,

678
00:33:51.471 --> 00:33:53.540
you know a lot of other stuff.
Would it change?

679
00:33:53.541 --> 00:33:56.630
So for that particular decision I think it was that same rule of like what

680
00:33:56.631 --> 00:33:59.510
scares me a little bit more.
Do the thing that scares you.
Yeah.

681
00:33:59.511 --> 00:34:03.230
So speaking of which startups,
I think there's a specific,

682
00:34:03.231 --> 00:34:06.980
some more general questions that a lot of people would be interested in.

683
00:34:07.550 --> 00:34:12.140
You've started stack overflow,
you started discourse.

684
00:34:12.141 --> 00:34:16.880
So what's the,
there's one,
two,
three guys,
whatever it is in the beginning.

685
00:34:17.180 --> 00:34:20.700
What was that process like?
Do you start talking about it?

686
00:34:20.701 --> 00:34:21.770
Do you start programming?

687
00:34:21.770 --> 00:34:25.580
Do you start like where does the birth and the catalyst that,

688
00:34:25.581 --> 00:34:28.100
actually I can talk about it in the context of us tech overflow in discourse.

689
00:34:28.101 --> 00:34:31.490
So if I think the key thing initially is there is a problem,
something,

690
00:34:31.550 --> 00:34:34.670
there's some state of the world that's unsatisfactory to the point that you're

691
00:34:34.820 --> 00:34:35.920
upset about it,
right?

692
00:34:35.921 --> 00:34:39.470
Like in that case it was experts exchange and Joel's original idea because I

693
00:34:39.471 --> 00:34:41.690
approached Joel's like,
Look Joel,
I have all this energy by my blog.

694
00:34:41.720 --> 00:34:43.190
I want to do something,
I want to build something,

695
00:34:43.191 --> 00:34:45.680
but I don't know what it is cause I'm not,
I'm honestly not a good idea person.

696
00:34:45.681 --> 00:34:48.620
I'm really not.
I'm like the execution guy.
I'm really good at execution,

697
00:34:48.621 --> 00:34:51.860
but I'm not good at like blue skying ideas,
not my forte,

698
00:34:52.010 --> 00:34:54.800
which is another reason why I like the community feedback cause they blue sky

699
00:34:54.801 --> 00:34:55.970
all day long for you.
Right?

700
00:34:56.270 --> 00:34:59.060
So when I can just go in and cherry pick a blue sky idea from community,

701
00:34:59.270 --> 00:35:01.580
even if I have to spend three hours reading to get one good idea,

702
00:35:01.581 --> 00:35:05.930
it's worth it man.
But anyway,
so the idea of from Joel was,
hey,
experts exchange,

703
00:35:06.380 --> 00:35:08.950
it's got great data but the spirits is hideous,
right?
It's,

704
00:35:08.951 --> 00:35:11.570
it's trying to trick you.
It feels like a used car salesman.
It's just bad.

705
00:35:11.960 --> 00:35:14.900
So I was like,
oh that's awesome.
It feeds into community.
It feeds into like,

706
00:35:14.901 --> 00:35:16.310
you know,
we can make it creative Commons.

707
00:35:16.610 --> 00:35:19.460
So I think the core is to have a really good idea that you feel very strongly

708
00:35:19.461 --> 00:35:22.470
about it in the beginning.
That like there's a wrong in the world that we will,

709
00:35:22.510 --> 00:35:22.581
uh,

710
00:35:22.581 --> 00:35:26.240
an injustice that we will write through the process of building this thing for

711
00:35:26.241 --> 00:35:27.350
discourse.
It was like,
look,

712
00:35:27.440 --> 00:35:32.440
there's no good software for communities to just hang out and like do stuff,

713
00:35:32.721 --> 00:35:34.340
right?
Like whether it's problem solving,

714
00:35:34.341 --> 00:35:37.950
start whatever forms are such a great building block of community and they're

715
00:35:38.070 --> 00:35:40.500
hideous.
They were so bad.
Right?
It was embarrassing.

716
00:35:40.680 --> 00:35:43.920
Like I literally was embarrassed to be associated with the software,
right?

717
00:35:44.110 --> 00:35:45.570
We have to have software that can be proud of.

718
00:35:45.660 --> 00:35:48.150
It's like this is competitive with Reddit,
this is competitive with Twitter,

719
00:35:48.300 --> 00:35:49.560
this is competitive with Facebook.
Right.

720
00:35:50.310 --> 00:35:53.250
That would be proud to have the software on my site.
Um,

721
00:35:53.460 --> 00:35:57.720
so that was the genesis of discourse was feeling very strongly about,
um,

722
00:35:58.560 --> 00:36:02.670
there needs to be a good solution for communities.
So that's step one.

723
00:36:02.671 --> 00:36:04.500
Dennis is funny.
You,
you feel super strongly about it,
right?

724
00:36:04.680 --> 00:36:06.600
And then people galvanize around the idea.

725
00:36:06.601 --> 00:36:08.490
Like Joel was already super excited about that idea.

726
00:36:08.491 --> 00:36:09.660
I was excited about the idea.

727
00:36:09.930 --> 00:36:13.200
So with the forum software I was posting on Twitter,

728
00:36:13.260 --> 00:36:16.560
I had researched as part of my research,
I started researching the problem,
right?

729
00:36:16.650 --> 00:36:21.420
I found a game called forum wars,
which was a parody of form.

730
00:36:21.421 --> 00:36:23.940
It's still very,
very funny of like foreign behavior circle.

731
00:36:23.941 --> 00:36:27.690
Like I would take 2003 it's age,
some,
right,

732
00:36:27.691 --> 00:36:30.870
like the behaviors a little different in their of Twitter.
But it was awesome.

733
00:36:30.871 --> 00:36:32.760
It was very funny and it was like a game.

734
00:36:32.761 --> 00:36:34.830
It's like an RPG and it had a forum attached to it.

735
00:36:34.831 --> 00:36:37.490
So it was like a game about forums with a forum attach.

736
00:36:37.491 --> 00:36:39.180
I was like this is awesome.
Right.
This is so cool.

737
00:36:39.480 --> 00:36:42.270
And the founder of that company or that project wasn't really,

738
00:36:42.280 --> 00:36:46.080
company contacted me,
this Guy Robin Ward from Toronto and said,
Hey,

739
00:36:46.090 --> 00:36:48.390
you know I saw you've been talking about forums and like I really love that

740
00:36:48.391 --> 00:36:49.224
problem space.

741
00:36:49.300 --> 00:36:52.050
It's like I'd still love to build really good forum software cause I don't think

742
00:36:52.051 --> 00:36:54.870
anything if there's any good.
And I was like awesome.
At that point I was like,

743
00:36:54.900 --> 00:36:58.560
we're starting a company because like I couldn't have wished for a better person

744
00:36:58.561 --> 00:37:01.350
and walk through the door and say,
I'm excited about this too.

745
00:37:01.470 --> 00:37:03.960
Same thing with Joel,
right?
I mean Joel was a legend in the industry,
right?

746
00:37:03.961 --> 00:37:06.540
So when he walked through it,
I'm excited about his problems.
Like me too,
man,

747
00:37:06.750 --> 00:37:10.560
we can do this,
right?
So the,
that to me is the most important step.

748
00:37:10.561 --> 00:37:13.500
It's like hanging out of your super excited about and another person,

749
00:37:13.560 --> 00:37:16.470
a cofounder,
right?
Cause again,
you get that dual leadership,
right?
Of like,

750
00:37:16.710 --> 00:37:21.480
am I making a bad decision?
Sometimes it's nice to have checks of like,

751
00:37:21.481 --> 00:37:25.560
is this a good idea?
I don't know.
Right?
So those are the,
the crucial seeds.

752
00:37:25.561 --> 00:37:29.260
But then starting to build stuff,
whether it's you programming types.

753
00:37:29.310 --> 00:37:31.560
So there's tons of research,
there's tons of research.
Like what?

754
00:37:31.561 --> 00:37:34.310
What's out there that failed because a lot of people looked at its successes.

755
00:37:34.320 --> 00:37:37.320
Oh look at how successful Lexis,
everybody looks at the successes.

756
00:37:37.321 --> 00:37:40.800
Those are boring.
Show me the failures because that is what's interesting.

757
00:37:40.801 --> 00:37:42.020
That's where people were experimenting.

758
00:37:42.050 --> 00:37:44.790
That's where people were pushing but and they failed.

759
00:37:44.791 --> 00:37:48.630
But they probably failed for reasons that weren't directly about the quality of

760
00:37:48.631 --> 00:37:51.390
their idea.
Right?
Yeah.
So look at all the failures.

761
00:37:51.391 --> 00:37:53.520
Don't just look what everybody looks at,
which is like,
oh Gosh,

762
00:37:53.521 --> 00:37:55.740
look at all these successful people,
look at the failures,

763
00:37:55.890 --> 00:37:58.830
look at the things that didn't work.
Research the entire field.

764
00:37:59.040 --> 00:38:03.480
And so that's the research that I was doing that led me to Robin Wright was that

765
00:38:03.690 --> 00:38:07.980
and then when we,
for example,
when we did a stack overflow,
we're like,
okay,

766
00:38:07.981 --> 00:38:10.950
well I really like elements of voting and Digg and reddit.
I like the,
the,

767
00:38:10.951 --> 00:38:12.750
the Wikipedia,
everything's up to date.

768
00:38:12.751 --> 00:38:16.680
Nothing is like an old tombstone that like has horrible out of date information.

769
00:38:16.920 --> 00:38:19.950
We know that works.
We compete.
He is an amazing resource.
Blogging,

770
00:38:19.951 --> 00:38:23.120
the idea of ownership is so powerful,
right?
Like,
Oh I,

771
00:38:23.130 --> 00:38:25.470
I Joe wrote this and look how good Joe is.
Answer is right.

772
00:38:25.471 --> 00:38:27.510
Like all these concepts we were on together,

773
00:38:27.690 --> 00:38:30.270
researching all the things that are out there that were working and why they

774
00:38:30.271 --> 00:38:32.370
were working and trying to like fold them into that.
Again,

775
00:38:32.371 --> 00:38:35.860
that Frankenstein's monster of what stack overflow is.
And by the way,

776
00:38:35.861 --> 00:38:39.250
that wasn't a free decision because there's still a ton of tension in the stack

777
00:38:39.251 --> 00:38:40.001
overflow system.

778
00:38:40.001 --> 00:38:43.480
There's reasons people complain about stack overflow it because it's so strict.

779
00:38:43.481 --> 00:38:46.150
Right?
Why is it so strict?
Why you guys always close to my questions?

780
00:38:46.450 --> 00:38:49.480
It's because there's so much tension that we built into the system around like

781
00:38:49.481 --> 00:38:53.760
trying to get good,
good results out of the system and you know,
it it,

782
00:38:54.730 --> 00:38:57.460
it's not a free,
that stuff doesn't come for free.
Right?

783
00:38:57.461 --> 00:39:01.510
It's not like we were all have perfect answers and nobody will have to get their

784
00:39:01.511 --> 00:39:04.470
feelings hurt or nobody will have to get down voted like that.

785
00:39:04.471 --> 00:39:05.770
It doesn't work that way.
Right.

786
00:39:06.540 --> 00:39:11.250
<v 2>So this is an interesting point.
A small tangent.
Yeah,
you right about anxiety.</v>

787
00:39:11.940 --> 00:39:16.200
So I've posted a lot of questions and answers on stack overflow and the

788
00:39:16.201 --> 00:39:21.190
questions I usually go to something very specific to something I'm working on
it.

789
00:39:21.200 --> 00:39:25.250
This is something you talk about that really the goal of stack overflow isn't

790
00:39:25.260 --> 00:39:29.040
about,
is to write a question,
not that's not about you,

791
00:39:29.280 --> 00:39:34.280
it's about the question that will help the community

792
00:39:35.080 --> 00:39:38.590
<v 1>future.
Right?
But that's a tough sell,
right?
Because people are like,
well,</v>

793
00:39:38.800 --> 00:39:40.260
you know,
I don't really care about the community.

794
00:39:40.261 --> 00:39:43.570
What I care about is my problem,
my problem.
Um,
and then that's fair,
right?
It's,

795
00:39:43.590 --> 00:39:46.390
it's sort of that,
again,
that tension,
that balancing active,
we want to help you,

796
00:39:46.690 --> 00:39:48.640
but we also wanna help everybody comes behind you,
right?

797
00:39:48.641 --> 00:39:50.260
The long line of people are going to come say,
oh,

798
00:39:50.410 --> 00:39:52.000
I kind of have that problem too.
Right?

799
00:39:52.270 --> 00:39:54.820
And if nobody's ever going to come up and say,
I have this problem too,

800
00:39:54.821 --> 00:39:58.420
then that question shouldn't exist on stack overflow because the question is too

801
00:39:58.421 --> 00:40:00.760
specific and that even that's tension,
right?
How do you judge that?

802
00:40:00.761 --> 00:40:03.850
How do you know that nobody's ever going to have this particular question again?

803
00:40:04.150 --> 00:40:06.520
Um,
so there's a lot of tension in the system.

804
00:40:06.770 --> 00:40:09.590
<v 2>Do you think that anxiety of asking the question,</v>

805
00:40:09.591 --> 00:40:14.591
the anxiety of answering that tension is inherent to programmers is inherent to

806
00:40:15.471 --> 00:40:20.120
this kind of process or,
or can it be improved?

807
00:40:20.300 --> 00:40:23.390
Can Be happy land where the,

808
00:40:23.391 --> 00:40:25.670
that tension is not quite so harsh?

809
00:40:26.260 --> 00:40:29.920
<v 1>Uh,
I don't think stack overflow can totally change the way it works.</v>

810
00:40:30.040 --> 00:40:34.510
One thing they are working on finally is the ask Paige had not changed since

811
00:40:34.511 --> 00:40:35.200
2011.

812
00:40:35.200 --> 00:40:39.520
I'm still kind of bitter about this because I feel like you have a Qa system and

813
00:40:39.521 --> 00:40:42.160
what are the core pages and EK system?
Well first of all,
the question,

814
00:40:42.161 --> 00:40:43.750
all the answers and all the also the aspx page,

815
00:40:43.751 --> 00:40:46.510
particularly when you're a new user or someone tried to ask question,

816
00:40:46.511 --> 00:40:49.930
that's the point at which you need the most help and we just didn't adapt with

817
00:40:49.931 --> 00:40:53.110
the Times.
But the good news is they're working on this from what I understand,

818
00:40:53.320 --> 00:40:56.800
and it's going to be more wizard based format and you could envision a world

819
00:40:56.801 --> 00:40:59.710
where as part of this wizard based program,
when you're asking questions,
okay,

820
00:40:59.890 --> 00:41:02.410
come up with a good title.
What are good words to put in a title?

821
00:41:02.530 --> 00:41:05.590
One word that's not good to put in the title is problem.
For example,

822
00:41:05.860 --> 00:41:10.000
I have a problem.
Oh you have a problem?
Okay,
a problem.
That's great.
Right?

823
00:41:10.001 --> 00:41:11.230
Like you need specifics,
right?

824
00:41:11.231 --> 00:41:13.960
Like so it's trying to help you make a good question.
Title for example,

825
00:41:14.200 --> 00:41:17.260
that step will be broken out.
Um,
all that stuff.

826
00:41:17.261 --> 00:41:20.350
But one of those steps in that wizard of asking could say,
Hey,

827
00:41:20.650 --> 00:41:22.540
I'm a little nervous,
you know,
I've never done this before.

828
00:41:22.630 --> 00:41:25.680
Can you put me in a queue for like special mentoring?
Right.

829
00:41:26.050 --> 00:41:28.780
You could opt in to a special mentor.
I think that would be fantastic.

830
00:41:28.781 --> 00:41:32.590
Like I don't have any objection to that at all in terms of being an optin system

831
00:41:32.591 --> 00:41:35.210
because there are that are like,
no,
I just want to help him.

832
00:41:35.480 --> 00:41:37.880
I want to help a person,
no matter what,
I want to go above and beyond.

833
00:41:37.880 --> 00:41:41.260
I want to spend like hours with this person.
Um,
I,

834
00:41:41.300 --> 00:41:44.420
it depends what their goals are,
right?
It's a great idea.
Who am I to judge?
Right?

835
00:41:44.570 --> 00:41:47.120
So that's fine.
It's not precluded from happening,

836
00:41:47.300 --> 00:41:50.120
but there's a certain big city ethos that we started with.
I'm like,
look,

837
00:41:50.121 --> 00:41:52.790
we're up in New York City.
You don't come to New York City and expect them to be,

838
00:41:52.791 --> 00:41:56.960
oh,
welcome to the city.
Joe.
Has It gone?
Come on in and let me show you around.

839
00:41:57.110 --> 00:42:01.760
That's not how New York City works,
right?
I mean,
and you know,
again,

840
00:42:01.761 --> 00:42:04.070
New York City's a reputation for being rude,
which actually don't think it is.

841
00:42:04.071 --> 00:42:05.640
Having been there fairly recently,
it's not real.

842
00:42:05.660 --> 00:42:07.700
People are just like going about their business right there.
Look,
look,

843
00:42:07.910 --> 00:42:11.450
I have things to do.
I'm busy.
I'm a busy professional,
as are you.

844
00:42:11.750 --> 00:42:14.600
And since you're a busy professional,
certainly when you ask a question,

845
00:42:14.601 --> 00:42:16.370
you're gonna ask the best possible question,
right?

846
00:42:16.370 --> 00:42:20.330
Because you're a busy professional and you would not accept anything less than a

847
00:42:20.331 --> 00:42:23.210
very well written question with a lot of detail about why you're doing it,

848
00:42:23.240 --> 00:42:26.090
what you're doing,
what you researched,
what you found right?

849
00:42:26.120 --> 00:42:28.340
Cause you're a professional like me,
right?

850
00:42:28.550 --> 00:42:32.270
And this rubs people sometimes the wrong way and I don't think it's wrong to
say,

851
00:42:32.271 --> 00:42:33.620
look,
I don't want that experience.

852
00:42:33.621 --> 00:42:37.550
I want just a more chill place for beginners.

853
00:42:37.551 --> 00:42:41.900
And I still think sacrifice is not,
was never designed for beginners,
right?

854
00:42:41.901 --> 00:42:45.100
There's this misconception that you know,
even Joel says something,
Oh yes,

855
00:42:45.101 --> 00:42:46.070
stack overflow for beginners.

856
00:42:46.071 --> 00:42:49.020
And I think if you're a prodigy it can be all right.

857
00:42:49.310 --> 00:42:51.710
But that's not really representative,
right?

858
00:42:51.711 --> 00:42:55.340
Like I think as a beginner you want a totally different set of tools you want

859
00:42:55.341 --> 00:42:59.180
like live screen sharing,
live chat,
you want access to resources,

860
00:42:59.181 --> 00:43:01.340
you want a playground,
like a a playground.

861
00:43:01.340 --> 00:43:05.270
You can experiment in and like test and all this stuff that we just don't give

862
00:43:05.271 --> 00:43:06.980
people because that was never really the,

863
00:43:06.981 --> 00:43:09.230
the audience that we were designing stack overflow for.

864
00:43:09.231 --> 00:43:10.400
That doesn't mean it's wrong.

865
00:43:10.640 --> 00:43:13.440
And I think it would be awesome if there was a site like that on the internet or

866
00:43:13.441 --> 00:43:15.740
if stack overflow.
I said Hey,
you know we're going to start doing this.

867
00:43:15.741 --> 00:43:17.510
That's fine too.
You know I'm not there.

868
00:43:17.511 --> 00:43:20.600
I'm not making those decisions but I do think the pressure,

869
00:43:20.630 --> 00:43:22.730
the tension that you described is there for people to be,

870
00:43:22.731 --> 00:43:26.330
look I'm a little nervous cause I know I've got to do my best work.
Right.

871
00:43:26.360 --> 00:43:29.930
The other one is something you talk about which is also really interesting to me

872
00:43:30.260 --> 00:43:33.680
is duplicate questions or do,
it's a,

873
00:43:33.740 --> 00:43:38.540
it's a really difficult problem that you highlight super pro,

874
00:43:38.610 --> 00:43:39.410
super hard.

875
00:43:39.410 --> 00:43:44.410
Like you can take one little topic and you could probably write 10 2030 ways of

876
00:43:45.021 --> 00:43:48.170
asking about that topic and there will be all different.

877
00:43:48.170 --> 00:43:51.500
I don't know if there's should be one page that answers all of it.

878
00:43:51.830 --> 00:43:56.830
Is there a way that stack overflow can help disambiguate like separate these

879
00:43:59.960 --> 00:44:04.130
duplicate questions or connect them together or is it a totally hopeless

880
00:44:04.250 --> 00:44:06.890
difficult,
impossible task?
I think it's a very,

881
00:44:06.891 --> 00:44:10.340
very hard computer science problem and partly because people are very good at

882
00:44:10.341 --> 00:44:13.160
using completely different words.
It always amazed me on stack overflow.

883
00:44:13.161 --> 00:44:16.160
You'd have two questions that were functionally identical and one question had

884
00:44:16.161 --> 00:44:19.010
like zero words in common with the other question.
I'm like,
oh my God,

885
00:44:19.520 --> 00:44:20.930
from a computer science particular perspective,

886
00:44:20.931 --> 00:44:24.470
how do you even begin to solve that?
And it happens all the time.

887
00:44:24.471 --> 00:44:25.970
People are super good at this,
right?

888
00:44:26.240 --> 00:44:31.240
Accidentally at asking the same thing in in like 10 20 different ways and the

889
00:44:31.561 --> 00:44:32.281
other complexities,

890
00:44:32.281 --> 00:44:35.430
we want some of those duplicates to exist because if there's five versions with

891
00:44:35.431 --> 00:44:38.760
different words,
have those five versions point to the one centralized answer,

892
00:44:39.270 --> 00:44:42.210
right?
It's like,
okay,
this is duplicating.
No,
no worries.
This here's the,

893
00:44:42.211 --> 00:44:45.630
here's the answer that you want it over here on this,
this,
this,
you know the,

894
00:44:45.631 --> 00:44:49.440
the prime example that we want to have rather than having 10 copies of the

895
00:44:49.441 --> 00:44:52.200
question and the answer because if you have 10 copies of the question you

896
00:44:52.201 --> 00:44:55.170
answered.
This also devalues the reputation system.
Which programmer's hate,

897
00:44:55.200 --> 00:44:56.430
as I previously mentioned,

898
00:44:56.820 --> 00:44:59.460
you're getting reputation for an answer that somebody else are gay.
It's like,

899
00:44:59.461 --> 00:45:02.130
well it's an answer,
but somebody or sorry gave that answer.

900
00:45:02.131 --> 00:45:05.490
So why are you getting reputation for the same answer as the other guy who gave

901
00:45:05.491 --> 00:45:07.710
it four years ago?
People get offended by that,
right?

902
00:45:07.711 --> 00:45:12.711
So the reputation system itself adds tension to the system in that the people

903
00:45:13.021 --> 00:45:16.440
who have a lot of reputation become very incentivized to enforce the reputation

904
00:45:16.441 --> 00:45:19.950
system.
Um,
and for the most part,
this is good.
I know it sounds weird,

905
00:45:19.951 --> 00:45:23.850
but for most parts like look strict systems,
I think to use stack overflow,

906
00:45:23.851 --> 00:45:26.520
you have to have the idea that okay,
strict systems ultimately work better.

907
00:45:26.670 --> 00:45:28.140
And I do think in programming,
uh,

908
00:45:28.210 --> 00:45:31.020
you're familiar with 'em loose typing versus strict typing,
right?

909
00:45:31.260 --> 00:45:33.810
The idea that you can declare a variable,
not declare a variable,

910
00:45:33.811 --> 00:45:36.270
rather just start using a variable and okay,
I see it's implicitly an integer.

911
00:45:36.271 --> 00:45:40.200
Bam.
Awesome.
Duck equals five.
Well,
duck is now an editor,
five,
right?

912
00:45:40.740 --> 00:45:42.300
And you're like,
cool,
awesome.
Simpler.
Right?

913
00:45:42.301 --> 00:45:44.760
Why would I want to worry about typing?
And for a long time,

914
00:45:44.761 --> 00:45:46.740
like in the Ruby community,
they're like,
yeah,
this is awesome.

915
00:45:46.741 --> 00:45:48.150
Like you just do a bunch of unit testing,

916
00:45:48.180 --> 00:45:52.000
which is testing your programs validity after the fact to catch any bugs that,

917
00:45:52.001 --> 00:45:54.690
that,
that strict typing and variables would have caught.

918
00:45:54.990 --> 00:45:57.300
And now you have this thing called typescript from Microsoft,

919
00:45:57.301 --> 00:46:01.840
from the guy who built c sharp Manders who's one of the greatest minds in

920
00:46:01.860 --> 00:46:05.070
software development,
right?
Like in terms of languages on and says,
no,
no,
no,

921
00:46:05.071 --> 00:46:07.890
we want to bolt on a strict type system to javascript because it makes things

922
00:46:07.891 --> 00:46:10.330
better.
And now everybody's like,
oh my God,
we,

923
00:46:10.360 --> 00:46:14.460
we deployed typescript and found 50 Layton bugs that we didn't know about.
Right.

924
00:46:14.461 --> 00:46:15.600
Like this is a super common.

925
00:46:15.750 --> 00:46:20.750
So I think there is a truth in programming that strictness,

926
00:46:20.970 --> 00:46:25.860
it's not the goal.
We're not saying be super strict.
His strictness is correct.
No,

927
00:46:25.861 --> 00:46:29.580
it's no,
no strict as produces better results.
That's what I'm saying.
Right.

928
00:46:29.790 --> 00:46:31.650
So strict typing of variables.

929
00:46:31.710 --> 00:46:35.340
I would say you almost universally have consensus now is basically correct.

930
00:46:35.370 --> 00:46:37.620
Should be that way in every language,
right?

931
00:46:37.650 --> 00:46:40.470
Duck equals five should share it an error because you know,
you didn't declare,

932
00:46:40.620 --> 00:46:43.770
you didn't tell me the duck was an editor,
right?
That's a bug,
right?

933
00:46:43.800 --> 00:46:46.410
Or maybe you missed time,
you type deck,
right instead of duck.
Right?

934
00:46:46.411 --> 00:46:50.220
You never know.
And this happens all the time,
right?
So with that in mind,

935
00:46:50.221 --> 00:46:52.470
I will say that the strict with the system is correct.

936
00:46:52.650 --> 00:46:56.010
Now that doesn't mean cruel.
That doesn't mean mean.
That doesn't mean angry.

937
00:46:56.040 --> 00:46:59.360
It just means strict.
Okay?
So I think where there's misunderstanding is,

938
00:46:59.460 --> 00:47:00.690
and people get cranky,
right?

939
00:47:00.691 --> 00:47:04.480
Like in other question you asked is like why are programmers kind of means

940
00:47:04.481 --> 00:47:07.350
sometimes?
Well,
Huda programmers work with all day long.

941
00:47:07.351 --> 00:47:12.300
So I have a theory that if you're in a job and you work with assholes all day

942
00:47:12.300 --> 00:47:15.570
long,
what do you eventually become?
An asshole.
An asshole.

943
00:47:15.720 --> 00:47:18.900
And what is the computer except the world's biggest asshole.

944
00:47:19.200 --> 00:47:22.500
Because the computer has no time for your bullshit.
The computer,

945
00:47:22.890 --> 00:47:25.200
the minute you make a mistake,
everything comes crashing down,
right?

946
00:47:25.260 --> 00:47:28.920
One semi-colon has crashed space missions,
right?
So that's normal.

947
00:47:28.960 --> 00:47:33.610
So you begin to internalize that.
You begin to think,
oh my coworker,

948
00:47:33.611 --> 00:47:37.150
the computer is super strict and kind of a jerk about everything.

949
00:47:37.420 --> 00:47:42.040
So that's kind of how I'm going to be because I work with this computer and I

950
00:47:42.041 --> 00:47:44.320
have to exceed to its terms on everything.

951
00:47:44.500 --> 00:47:47.200
So therefore you start to absorb that and you start to think,
oh well,

952
00:47:47.201 --> 00:47:51.940
being really strict arbitrarily is really good and error of error code five six

953
00:47:51.941 --> 00:47:52.091
two,

954
00:47:52.091 --> 00:47:54.940
four nine is a completely good error message because that's what the computer

955
00:47:54.941 --> 00:47:55.960
gave me,
right?

956
00:47:56.020 --> 00:48:00.310
So you kind of forget to be a person at some level and you know how they say

957
00:48:00.311 --> 00:48:04.180
great detectives,
internalized criminals,
and kind of are criminals themselves.

958
00:48:04.181 --> 00:48:08.050
Like this trope of the master detective is good because he can think like the

959
00:48:08.051 --> 00:48:10.330
criminal.
Well,
I do think that's true of programmers.

960
00:48:10.360 --> 00:48:13.930
Really good programmers think like the computer because that's their job.

961
00:48:14.170 --> 00:48:15.880
But if you internalize it too much,

962
00:48:15.881 --> 00:48:20.110
you become the computer and you've come up kind of a jerk to everybody because

963
00:48:20.470 --> 00:48:22.630
that's what you've internalized.
You're almost not a jerk,

964
00:48:22.631 --> 00:48:26.050
but you have no patience for lack of strictness.
As you said,

965
00:48:26.170 --> 00:48:28.600
it's not out of a sense of meanness.
It's accidental.

966
00:48:28.601 --> 00:48:31.990
But I do believe it's an occupational hazard of being a programmer is you start

967
00:48:31.991 --> 00:48:35.860
to behave like the computer.
You're very unforgiving.
You're very terse,

968
00:48:35.861 --> 00:48:39.730
you're very oh,
wrong,
incorrect,
move on.
It's like,
well,
can you help me?

969
00:48:39.731 --> 00:48:43.960
Like what could I do to fix up wrong,
say next question.
Right?

970
00:48:43.961 --> 00:48:47.740
Like that's normal for the computer,
right?
Just fail next.
Right?

971
00:48:47.741 --> 00:48:51.190
Like out of you remember in Saturday night live,

972
00:48:51.191 --> 00:48:55.420
like in the 90s they had this character,
it was an it guy.
The move guy

973
00:48:55.910 --> 00:49:00.620
<v 2>move.
Was that Jimmy Fallon?
No,
no.
I can't play it on the,</v>

974
00:49:01.100 --> 00:49:02.030
okay.
Yeah,
I remember

975
00:49:02.090 --> 00:49:05.540
<v 1>move.
Right.
And he had no patience for,
it might've been mad TV actually.</v>

976
00:49:05.940 --> 00:49:08.780
That might've been,
it might've been,
but anyway,
that was the,

977
00:49:08.840 --> 00:49:12.530
that's always been the perception,
right?
You start to behave like the computer.

978
00:49:12.531 --> 00:49:14.450
It's like,
oh,
you're wrong.
Out of the way.
You know,

979
00:49:14.830 --> 00:49:19.240
<v 2>you've written so many blog posts about programming,
about programs,
programming,</v>

980
00:49:20.280 --> 00:49:21.820
uh,
programmers.

981
00:49:22.630 --> 00:49:25.360
What do you think makes a good,

982
00:49:25.630 --> 00:49:28.720
let's start with what makes a good solo programmer?

983
00:49:29.360 --> 00:49:31.550
<v 1>Well,
I don't think you should be a solo program.</v>

984
00:49:31.551 --> 00:49:34.640
I think to be a good seller programmer.
It's kind of like what I talked about.

985
00:49:34.660 --> 00:49:37.940
I will,
not on Mike,
but one of the things,
uh,
John Carmack,

986
00:49:37.970 --> 00:49:40.940
one of the best points he makes in the book masters of doom,

987
00:49:40.941 --> 00:49:43.670
which is a fantastic book and it anybody listening to this who hasn't read it,

988
00:49:43.671 --> 00:49:45.440
please read it.
It's such a great book,

989
00:49:45.770 --> 00:49:50.060
is that at the time they were working on stuff like Wolfen Stein and doom.

990
00:49:50.360 --> 00:49:52.730
Like they didn't have the resources that we have today.

991
00:49:52.731 --> 00:49:54.830
They didn't have stack overflow,
they didn't have Wikipedia,

992
00:49:54.831 --> 00:49:56.630
they didn't have like discourse forums.

993
00:49:56.631 --> 00:50:00.170
They didn't have places to go to get people to help them write.

994
00:50:00.171 --> 00:50:01.730
They had to work on their own.

995
00:50:02.030 --> 00:50:04.670
And that's why it took a genius like Carmax to do this stuff.

996
00:50:04.671 --> 00:50:06.920
Cause you had to be a genius to invent from first principles.

997
00:50:07.100 --> 00:50:08.480
A lot of the stuff he was,
he was like,

998
00:50:08.510 --> 00:50:11.870
the hacks he was coming up with were genius,
right?
Genius level stuff.

999
00:50:11.871 --> 00:50:15.500
But you don't need to be a genius anymore and that means not working by
yourself.

1000
00:50:15.501 --> 00:50:17.150
You have to be good at researching stuff online.

1001
00:50:17.330 --> 00:50:18.950
You have to be good at asking questions,

1002
00:50:19.190 --> 00:50:21.530
really good questions that are really well researched,
which implies,
oh,

1003
00:50:21.531 --> 00:50:24.200
I went out and researched for three hours before I wrote this question is like

1004
00:50:24.201 --> 00:50:28.610
that's what you should be doing because that's what's gonna make you good.
To me,

1005
00:50:28.611 --> 00:50:31.010
this is the big difference between programming in like the 80s versus

1006
00:50:31.011 --> 00:50:34.850
programming today is like you,
you kind of had to be by yourself back then.

1007
00:50:34.851 --> 00:50:36.290
Like where would you go for answers?

1008
00:50:36.470 --> 00:50:40.910
I remember in the early days when I was a learning visual basic for windows,

1009
00:50:41.090 --> 00:50:45.490
like I would call the Microsoft helpline on the phone when I had like program

1010
00:50:45.640 --> 00:50:46.820
because I was like,
I don't know what to do.

1011
00:50:46.940 --> 00:50:49.790
So I would like go and call and they have these huge phone banks and like,

1012
00:50:49.791 --> 00:50:52.330
can you imagine how alien that is now?
Like who would do that?
Right?

1013
00:50:52.331 --> 00:50:57.200
Like that's crazy.
So there was just nowhere else to go when you got stuck.
Right.

1014
00:50:57.201 --> 00:51:01.070
Like I had the books that came with it.
I read those,
study,
those religiously.

1015
00:51:01.250 --> 00:51:05.630
I just saw a post from Steve Sinofsky that said this c plus plus virgin seven

1016
00:51:05.870 --> 00:51:10.870
came with like 10,000 pages of written material because where else were you

1017
00:51:12.171 --> 00:51:15.290
going to figure that stuff out and go to the library when you didn't have

1018
00:51:15.291 --> 00:51:18.070
Wikipedia,
you didn't have,
you know,
reddit,
you know,

1019
00:51:18.110 --> 00:51:21.370
anywhere to go to answer these questions.
So you,
you,

1020
00:51:21.380 --> 00:51:26.180
you've talked about through the years basically not having an ego and not

1021
00:51:26.181 --> 00:51:31.070
thinking that you're a,
the best programmer in the world and it's always kind of

1022
00:51:32.630 --> 00:51:36.260
just looking to improve the,
become a better program than you were yesterday.

1023
00:51:36.470 --> 00:51:39.970
So how have you changed as a programmer and as a,

1024
00:51:40.580 --> 00:51:44.660
as a thinker designer around programming over the past?

1025
00:51:45.140 --> 00:51:48.860
What is it,
15 years really of being a public figure?

1026
00:51:48.950 --> 00:51:52.730
I would say the big insight that I had is eventually as a programmer and you

1027
00:51:52.731 --> 00:51:55.790
have to kind of stop writing code to be effective,
which is kind of disturbing.

1028
00:51:56.490 --> 00:52:01.220
Um,
cause you really love it and,
but you realize like being effective at program,

1029
00:52:01.520 --> 00:52:03.140
at programming in the,
in the general sense,

1030
00:52:03.660 --> 00:52:06.560
it doesn't mean writing code and a lot of times you can be much more successful

1031
00:52:06.561 --> 00:52:10.280
by not writing code and writing code in terms of just solving the problems you

1032
00:52:10.281 --> 00:52:13.760
have essentially hiring people that are really good and like setting them free

1033
00:52:13.761 --> 00:52:17.600
and like giving them basic direction,
right?
Like on strategy and stuff.

1034
00:52:17.960 --> 00:52:21.050
Cause a lot of the problems you encounter aren't necessarily solved who like

1035
00:52:21.260 --> 00:52:24.530
really gnarly code.
They're solved by conceptual solutions,

1036
00:52:25.010 --> 00:52:28.250
which can then be turned into code.
But are you even solving the right problem?

1037
00:52:28.610 --> 00:52:33.350
I mean,
so I would say for me the main insight of have is,
is,

1038
00:52:33.351 --> 00:52:37.520
is to succeed as a programmer you eventually kind of stopped writing code.

1039
00:52:37.521 --> 00:52:39.620
That's going to sound discouraging.
Probably two people hearing.

1040
00:52:39.621 --> 00:52:40.700
But I don't mean it that way.

1041
00:52:40.701 --> 00:52:43.700
What I mean is that you're coding at a higher level language eventually.

1042
00:52:43.701 --> 00:52:46.370
Like okay,
so we're coding in assembly language,
right?
That's the beginning,
right?

1043
00:52:46.580 --> 00:52:49.970
You're hard coded to the architecture then.
Yes.
Stuff like see where it's like,

1044
00:52:49.971 --> 00:52:52.550
wow,
we can abstract across the architecture and the right code,

1045
00:52:52.551 --> 00:52:56.260
I can then compile that code for arm or you know,
whatever,
you know,

1046
00:52:56.300 --> 00:53:00.080
x 86 or whatever else is out there and then even higher level than that.
Right?

1047
00:53:00.081 --> 00:53:01.550
Like you're looking at like python,

1048
00:53:01.551 --> 00:53:04.940
Ruby interpreted languages and then to me as a program like,
okay,

1049
00:53:04.941 --> 00:53:06.950
I want to go even higher.
I want to go higher than that.

1050
00:53:07.130 --> 00:53:08.750
How do I abstract higher than language?
It's like,

1051
00:53:08.751 --> 00:53:12.110
well you abstract in spoken language and written language,
right?

1052
00:53:12.111 --> 00:53:15.320
Like you're sort of inspiring people to get things done.
Giving them guidance.

1053
00:53:15.321 --> 00:53:16.850
Like what if we did this?
What if we did this?

1054
00:53:17.440 --> 00:53:19.760
You're writing in the highest level language that there is,

1055
00:53:19.761 --> 00:53:22.670
which is for me English,
right?
Whatever your spoken languages.

1056
00:53:23.030 --> 00:53:27.650
So it's all about being effective,
right?
And I think,
uh,

1057
00:53:28.350 --> 00:53:33.120
Patrick McKenzie patio 11 on Hacker News and works at Stripe has a great post

1058
00:53:33.121 --> 00:53:37.590
about this of how calling yourself a programmer is a career limiting move at

1059
00:53:37.591 --> 00:53:40.710
some level once you get far enough from your current.
I really believe that.

1060
00:53:40.770 --> 00:53:43.950
And I,
and again,
I apologize,
this is sound discouraging.
I don't mean it to be,

1061
00:53:43.951 --> 00:53:47.730
but he's so right,
because all this stuff that goes on around the code,

1062
00:53:47.731 --> 00:53:50.900
like the people,
like that's another thing.
If you look at my early blog entries,

1063
00:53:50.950 --> 00:53:55.210
it was about wow,
programming is about people more than it's about co,

1064
00:53:55.211 --> 00:53:56.670
which doesn't really make sense,
right?

1065
00:53:56.671 --> 00:53:59.130
But it's about can these people even get along together?

1066
00:53:59.131 --> 00:54:00.570
Can they understand each other?

1067
00:54:00.810 --> 00:54:02.970
Can you even explain to me what it is you're working on?

1068
00:54:02.971 --> 00:54:05.340
Are you solving the right problem?
People were right.

1069
00:54:05.341 --> 00:54:08.490
Another classic program book,
which again up there with code complete,

1070
00:54:08.491 --> 00:54:11.550
please read people where it's that software is people,
right?

1071
00:54:11.551 --> 00:54:13.470
People are the software first and foremost.

1072
00:54:13.471 --> 00:54:16.290
So a lot of the skills that I was working on early on the blog,

1073
00:54:16.291 --> 00:54:19.350
we're about figuring out the people parts of programming,

1074
00:54:19.351 --> 00:54:21.630
which was the harder part,
the hard part of programming.

1075
00:54:21.631 --> 00:54:23.040
Once you get to certain skill of them programming,

1076
00:54:23.041 --> 00:54:26.100
you can pretty much solve any reasonable problem that's put in front of you.

1077
00:54:26.280 --> 00:54:28.950
You're not writing algorithms from scratch,
right?
That just doesn't happen.

1078
00:54:29.190 --> 00:54:31.790
So any sort of reasonable problems put in front of you are going to be able to

1079
00:54:31.791 --> 00:54:35.970
solve.
But what you can't solve is our manager is a total jerk.

1080
00:54:36.870 --> 00:54:40.560
You cannot solve that with code.
That is not a code solvable problem.

1081
00:54:40.740 --> 00:54:43.860
And yet that will cripple you way more than,
oh,

1082
00:54:43.861 --> 00:54:47.100
we had to use the stupid framework I don't like or,
or you know,

1083
00:54:47.101 --> 00:54:50.790
Sam keeps writing bad code that I hate or you know,
you know,

1084
00:54:50.880 --> 00:54:53.250
Dave is off there in the wilderness writing,
God knows what,
right.

1085
00:54:53.251 --> 00:54:54.520
These are not your problems,
your problems,

1086
00:54:54.540 --> 00:54:59.040
your manager or a coworker is so toxic to everybody else in your team that like

1087
00:54:59.041 --> 00:55:01.680
nobody can get anything done because everybody's so stressed out and freaked
out.

1088
00:55:01.681 --> 00:55:04.980
Right.
These are the problems that you have to attack.
Absolutely.

1089
00:55:04.981 --> 00:55:07.320
And so as you go to these higher level abstractions,

1090
00:55:07.321 --> 00:55:10.470
as you've developed as a programmer to higher,
higher level abstractions

1091
00:55:10.580 --> 00:55:15.560
<v 2>go into natural language,
you're also the guy who kind of preached,
you know,</v>

1092
00:55:15.561 --> 00:55:18.880
building it,
you know,
just diving in and doing it and,
and,
and,

1093
00:55:18.950 --> 00:55:23.480
and like learn by doing.
Yes.
Do you,

1094
00:55:24.180 --> 00:55:25.350
<v 1>do you worry</v>

1095
00:55:26.140 --> 00:55:29.980
<v 2>that as you get to higher,
higher level abstractions,</v>

1096
00:55:30.010 --> 00:55:35.010
you lose track of the lower level of just building a is like,

1097
00:55:35.861 --> 00:55:39.610
do you worry about that?
You know,
even not maybe now,
but 10 years from now,

1098
00:55:39.611 --> 00:55:40.540
20 years from now?

1099
00:55:41.530 --> 00:55:44.320
<v 1>Well,
no,
I mean there is always that paranoia and oh gosh,</v>

1100
00:55:44.321 --> 00:55:46.600
I don't feel as valuable since I'm not writing code.
But for me,

1101
00:55:46.601 --> 00:55:48.670
like when we started the discourse project,
it was ruby,

1102
00:55:48.671 --> 00:55:51.520
which I didn't really know Ruby.
I mean as you pointed out,

1103
00:55:51.521 --> 00:55:53.560
and this is another valuable substrates from stack overflow,

1104
00:55:53.770 --> 00:55:56.770
you can be super proficient at the,
for example,
c sharp,
which I was working in.

1105
00:55:56.771 --> 00:55:57.191
That's what we built,

1106
00:55:57.191 --> 00:56:00.160
stack overflow and it still is written in and then switched to ruby.

1107
00:56:00.161 --> 00:56:03.190
And you're a newbie again,
right?
Like I'm but,
but you have the framework.

1108
00:56:03.191 --> 00:56:06.310
I know what a four loop is.
I don't,
recursion is,
I know,

1109
00:56:06.340 --> 00:56:09.430
you know what a strat stack traces,
right?

1110
00:56:09.610 --> 00:56:12.000
Like I have all the fundamental concepts to be a programmer.

1111
00:56:12.010 --> 00:56:15.640
I just don't know Ruby.
So I'm still on a higher level.
I'm not like a beginner,

1112
00:56:15.641 --> 00:56:16.960
beginner,
like you're saying.
I'm just like,

1113
00:56:16.961 --> 00:56:20.200
I need to apply my programming concepts of already know to ruby

1114
00:56:20.280 --> 00:56:24.490
<v 2>what suddenly there's a question that's really interesting.
So looking at Ruby,</v>

1115
00:56:24.940 --> 00:56:28.540
<v 1>how do you go about learning enough that your intuition can be applied?</v>

1116
00:56:28.570 --> 00:56:29.560
Well that carried over.

1117
00:56:29.710 --> 00:56:31.840
I was trying to get to is like what I realized pretty when I started with just

1118
00:56:31.841 --> 00:56:36.490
me and Robin.
I realized if I bother Robin,
I am now costing US productivity,

1119
00:56:36.610 --> 00:56:41.230
right?
Every time I go to Robin rather than building the,
the,
uh,
our,

1120
00:56:41.231 --> 00:56:43.450
our first Alpha version of discourse,

1121
00:56:43.780 --> 00:56:46.030
he's now answering my stupid questions about Ruby.

1122
00:56:46.031 --> 00:56:48.880
Is that a good use of his time?
Is that a good use of my time?

1123
00:56:49.140 --> 00:56:52.330
And the answer of the both of those was resoundingly no,
right?

1124
00:56:52.331 --> 00:56:55.320
Like we were getting to an Alpha and it was a pretty much like,
okay,

1125
00:56:55.330 --> 00:56:56.710
we'll hire more programmers.
Right?

1126
00:56:56.711 --> 00:57:01.100
Like we eventually hired Neil and then eventually Sam who came in as a co

1127
00:57:01.101 --> 00:57:05.910
founder.
Um,
actually it was Sam first than Neil later.
But the answer,

1128
00:57:05.930 --> 00:57:07.470
the problem is just higher other competent programs.

1129
00:57:07.471 --> 00:57:11.620
It's not like teach now I shelter,
pull myself up by my bootstraps and,
and,

1130
00:57:11.640 --> 00:57:13.210
and learn Ruby.
But at some point,

1131
00:57:13.211 --> 00:57:17.380
writing code becomes a liability to you in terms of getting things done.

1132
00:57:17.381 --> 00:57:19.390
There's so many other things that go on in the project,

1133
00:57:19.391 --> 00:57:22.150
like building the prototype like you mentioned,
like,
well how do you,

1134
00:57:22.360 --> 00:57:24.880
if you're not writing code has a re keep focus on like what,
what,

1135
00:57:24.881 --> 00:57:28.390
what are we building?
Well,
first basic mockups and research,
right?
Look like,

1136
00:57:28.430 --> 00:57:31.210
what do we even want to build?
There's a little bit of that that goes on.

1137
00:57:31.260 --> 00:57:33.550
Then very quickly you get to the prototype stage,
like build a prototype,

1138
00:57:33.760 --> 00:57:35.710
let's iterate on the prototype really,
really rapidly.

1139
00:57:35.920 --> 00:57:36.850
And that's what we do with this course.

1140
00:57:36.851 --> 00:57:40.420
And that's what we demo to get our seed funding for discourse was the Alpha

1141
00:57:40.421 --> 00:57:44.440
version of discourse,
um,
that we had running and ready to go in.
It was very,

1142
00:57:44.441 --> 00:57:47.620
it was bad.
I mean it was,
I'll just tell you it was bad.
Um,
I have,

1143
00:57:47.621 --> 00:57:50.200
we have screenshots of it.
I'm just like embarrassed to look at it now.
Um,

1144
00:57:50.560 --> 00:57:52.600
but it was the prototype we were figuring out like what,
what's working,

1145
00:57:52.601 --> 00:57:57.160
what's not working?
Because there's such a broad gap between between um,

1146
00:57:57.790 --> 00:58:00.700
the way you think things will work in your mind or even on paper and the way

1147
00:58:00.701 --> 00:58:03.070
they work once you sit and live in the software,

1148
00:58:03.071 --> 00:58:06.490
like actually spend time living and breathing and sour.
So different.

1149
00:58:06.670 --> 00:58:11.670
So my philosophy is get to a prototype and then what you're really optimizing

1150
00:58:12.371 --> 00:58:14.470
for speed of iteration,
like how you can turn the crank,

1151
00:58:14.800 --> 00:58:16.120
how quickly can we iterate.

1152
00:58:16.121 --> 00:58:18.910
That's the absolutely critical metric of any software project.

1153
00:58:19.180 --> 00:58:21.820
And I had a tweet recently that people liked and I totally,

1154
00:58:21.850 --> 00:58:25.480
this is so fundamental to what I do is like if you want to measure the core

1155
00:58:25.481 --> 00:58:27.340
competency of any software tech company,

1156
00:58:27.610 --> 00:58:30.760
it's the speed at which somebody can say,
hey,
we really need this word.

1157
00:58:30.760 --> 00:58:32.260
And the product changed to this word,
right?

1158
00:58:32.261 --> 00:58:34.580
Because it will be more clear to the users,
like what?

1159
00:58:34.640 --> 00:58:37.750
Like instead of respondents reply or something.
But there's some the,

1160
00:58:38.020 --> 00:58:42.230
from the conception of that idea to how quickly that single word can be changing

1161
00:58:42.250 --> 00:58:45.820
your software rolled out to users,
that is your life cycle.
That's your health,

1162
00:58:45.850 --> 00:58:49.690
your,
your heartbeat.
If your heartbeat is like super slow,

1163
00:58:49.990 --> 00:58:52.180
you're basically debt.
No,
seriously,

1164
00:58:52.181 --> 00:58:56.200
like if it takes two weeks or even a month to get that single word change,

1165
00:58:56.201 --> 00:58:58.990
there was,
oh my God,
this is great idea.
That word is so much clearer.

1166
00:58:58.991 --> 00:59:01.630
I'm telling me like a super,
like,
everybody's on board for this change.

1167
00:59:01.631 --> 00:59:03.250
It's not like,
let's just change a word because we're bored.

1168
00:59:03.400 --> 00:59:05.470
It's like this is an awesome change.
Um,

1169
00:59:05.530 --> 00:59:07.840
and then it takes them months to roll out.
It's like,
well,
your dad,

1170
00:59:07.880 --> 00:59:11.890
like you can't iterate,
you can't [inaudible] you can do anything.
Right?
Like,

1171
00:59:12.310 --> 00:59:14.490
so anyway,
about the heartbeat,
it's like get the,
the,

1172
00:59:14.491 --> 00:59:16.270
the prototype and then iterate on it.
That's,

1173
00:59:16.271 --> 00:59:20.260
that's what I view is like the central tenant of modern software development.

1174
00:59:20.440 --> 00:59:21.980
That's fascinating.
You put it that way.

1175
00:59:21.980 --> 00:59:24.410
<v 0>It's actually,
so I work in,
I build autonomous vehicles.</v>

1176
00:59:24.411 --> 00:59:26.960
And when you look at what,
uh,

1177
00:59:27.080 --> 00:59:31.310
maybe compared to Tesla to most other auto makers,
uh,
the psych,

1178
00:59:31.340 --> 00:59:36.340
the whatever the heartbeat for Tesla is literally days now in terms of they can,

1179
00:59:36.720 --> 00:59:40.910
um,
over the air deploy software updates to all of their vehicles,

1180
00:59:41.120 --> 00:59:44.420
which is markedly different than every other automaker,

1181
00:59:44.750 --> 00:59:49.610
which takes years to update a piece of software.
And so,

1182
00:59:49.690 --> 00:59:53.900
uh,
and that's reflected in everything that's,
um,
the,

1183
00:59:54.010 --> 00:59:58.000
the final product.
It's reflected in really how slowly they adapt to the times.

1184
00:59:58.150 --> 01:00:00.580
<v 1>And to be clear,
I'm not saying being a hummingbird is the goal either.</v>

1185
01:00:00.610 --> 01:00:02.990
It's like you don't,
when a heartbeat that's like so fast,
it's like you're,

1186
01:00:02.991 --> 01:00:04.390
you're,
when you,
you know,
you're just freaking out,

1187
01:00:04.540 --> 01:00:07.190
but like it is a measure of health.
You should have a healthy heartbeat.
Right?

1188
01:00:07.191 --> 01:00:09.550
And it's up to,
for people listening this decide what that means,

1189
01:00:09.551 --> 01:00:10.840
but it has to be healthy.

1190
01:00:10.841 --> 01:00:13.310
It has to be reasonable because otherwise you just get me frustrating.

1191
01:00:13.311 --> 01:00:16.570
Cause it's like that's how you build software.
You make mistakes,
you roll it out,

1192
01:00:16.571 --> 01:00:19.150
you live with it.
You see what it feels like and say,
Oh God,

1193
01:00:19.151 --> 01:00:22.210
that was a terrible idea.
Or Oh my gosh,
this could be even better if we did.
Why?

1194
01:00:22.211 --> 01:00:24.970
Right?
You turn the crank and then the more you do that,

1195
01:00:24.971 --> 01:00:28.960
the faster you get ahead of your competitors ultimately because you're its rate

1196
01:00:28.961 --> 01:00:32.860
of change,
right?
Delta v,
right?
How fast are you moving?
Well,

1197
01:00:32.861 --> 01:00:36.280
within a year you're going to be miles away.
By the time they catch up with you,

1198
01:00:36.281 --> 01:00:40.530
right?
Like that's the way it works in plus users,
like I as a software developer,

1199
01:00:40.540 --> 01:00:44.200
he's or I love software that's constantly changing because I don't understand.

1200
01:00:44.201 --> 01:00:47.140
People get super pissed off when like,
oh,
they changed the software.
I mean,

1201
01:00:47.141 --> 01:00:50.770
how dare they?
I'm like,
yes,
change the software.
Change it all the time,
man.

1202
01:00:50.771 --> 01:00:51.220
That's,

1203
01:00:51.220 --> 01:00:55.540
that's what makes this stuff great is that it can be changed so rapidly and

1204
01:00:55.541 --> 01:00:58.810
become something that that is greater than it is now.
Now granted,

1205
01:00:58.811 --> 01:01:02.020
there's some changes that suck.
I admit I've seen him many times.

1206
01:01:02.200 --> 01:01:05.020
But in general it's like that's what makes software cool,
right?

1207
01:01:05.021 --> 01:01:06.430
It's that it is so malleable,

1208
01:01:06.431 --> 01:01:08.860
like fighting that is like weird to me cause it's like,

1209
01:01:08.861 --> 01:01:12.010
well you're fighting the essence of the thing that you're building.

1210
01:01:12.011 --> 01:01:13.870
Like that doesn't make sense.
You want to really embrace that.

1211
01:01:13.871 --> 01:01:15.190
Not not to be a hummingbird,

1212
01:01:15.400 --> 01:01:18.010
but like embrace it to a healthy cycle of your heartbeat.
Right.

1213
01:01:18.120 --> 01:01:22.450
<v 0>So you talk about that people really don't change.
It's true.
The,</v>

1214
01:01:22.470 --> 01:01:23.340
that's why I probably,

1215
01:01:23.341 --> 01:01:26.490
a lot of the stuff you write about and your blog probably will

1216
01:01:26.760 --> 01:01:29.350
<v 1>remains true.
There's a flip side of that coin.
People don't change.</v>

1217
01:01:29.351 --> 01:01:31.960
So investing in understanding people is,

1218
01:01:31.961 --> 01:01:36.790
is like learning Unix in 1970 because nothing has changed,

1219
01:01:36.791 --> 01:01:37.480
right?
Like yeah,

1220
01:01:37.480 --> 01:01:40.390
all those things you've learned about people will still be valid 30 40 years

1221
01:01:40.391 --> 01:01:43.150
from now.
Whereas if you learn the latest javascript framework,

1222
01:01:43.151 --> 01:01:45.760
that's going to be good for like two years.
Right?
Exactly.

1223
01:01:46.290 --> 01:01:51.120
<v 0>So,
but if you look at the future of programming,
so there's a people component,</v>

1224
01:01:51.121 --> 01:01:55.020
but there's also the technology itself.
Do you,

1225
01:01:55.050 --> 01:01:57.300
what do you see as the future of programming?

1226
01:01:57.301 --> 01:02:01.770
Will it change significantly or as far as you can tell,
uh,

1227
01:02:01.830 --> 01:02:05.640
people are ultimately programming and so it will not,

1228
01:02:05.950 --> 01:02:09.420
it's not something that you foresee changing in any fundamental

1229
01:02:09.970 --> 01:02:14.620
<v 1>well you've got to go look back on sort of the basics of programming and one</v>

1230
01:02:14.621 --> 01:02:16.360
thing that always shocked me is like source control.

1231
01:02:16.361 --> 01:02:18.790
Like I didn't learn anything that source control on grand.

1232
01:02:18.820 --> 01:02:23.820
I graduate from college in 1992 but I remember hearing from people like in La as

1233
01:02:24.840 --> 01:02:28.890
ladies like 1998 1999 like even maybe today they're not learning source control.

1234
01:02:28.920 --> 01:02:31.500
And to me it's like well how can you not learn source control?

1235
01:02:31.560 --> 01:02:35.160
That is so fundamental to working with other programmers working in a way that

1236
01:02:35.161 --> 01:02:37.520
you don't lose your work.
Like just just basic soft,

1237
01:02:37.560 --> 01:02:41.100
the bed literal bedrock software development is source control.

1238
01:02:41.190 --> 01:02:43.920
Now you compare it today like get up,
right?
Like Microsoft to get help,

1239
01:02:43.921 --> 01:02:46.410
which I think was incredibly smart.
Acquisition move on their part.

1240
01:02:46.920 --> 01:02:50.520
Now they have anybody who wants like reasonable source controls and go send them

1241
01:02:50.521 --> 01:02:54.020
and get hub.
It's all set up for you,
right?
There's tons of walkthroughs,

1242
01:02:54.030 --> 01:02:54.930
tons of tutorials.

1243
01:02:55.260 --> 01:02:58.860
So from the concept of like has programming advanced from say 1999 it's like

1244
01:02:58.861 --> 01:03:01.950
well hell we have get hub.
I mean my God,
yes.
Right.
Like it's,

1245
01:03:01.951 --> 01:03:06.910
it's massively advanced over over what it was now as to whether programming is

1246
01:03:06.920 --> 01:03:09.660
is significantly different.
Um,
I'm going to say no.

1247
01:03:09.661 --> 01:03:14.661
But I think the baseline of like what we view as like fundamentals will continue

1248
01:03:15.001 --> 01:03:17.270
to go up and actually get better like source control.

1249
01:03:17.290 --> 01:03:19.050
Cause that's one of the fundamentals that has gotten,

1250
01:03:19.051 --> 01:03:23.520
I mean hundreds of orders of magnitude better than it was 10 20 years.

1251
01:03:23.750 --> 01:03:24.930
<v 0>So those are the fundamentals.</v>

1252
01:03:24.931 --> 01:03:27.840
Let me introduce to things that maybe you can comment on.

1253
01:03:28.260 --> 01:03:30.930
So one is mobile phones,

1254
01:03:31.020 --> 01:03:34.790
so that could fundamentally transform what PR,

1255
01:03:35.970 --> 01:03:39.030
what programming is or maybe not.
Maybe you can comment on that.

1256
01:03:39.240 --> 01:03:41.220
And the other one is artificial intelligence,

1257
01:03:41.490 --> 01:03:46.490
which promises to in some ways to do some of the programming for you,

1258
01:03:48.060 --> 01:03:52.890
is one way to think about it.
So it's really what a programmer is,
is,
is,
uh,

1259
01:03:53.310 --> 01:03:57.990
using the intelligence that's inside your skull to,
to do something useful.
Uh,

1260
01:03:57.991 --> 01:04:01.590
the hope with artificial intelligence is that it does some of the useful parts

1261
01:04:01.591 --> 01:04:03.300
for you will,
you don't have to think about it.

1262
01:04:03.540 --> 01:04:06.240
So do you see smart phones in fact,

1263
01:04:06.241 --> 01:04:09.540
that everybody has one and they are getting more and more powerful as

1264
01:04:09.541 --> 01:04:13.740
potentially changing programming?
And do you see AI is potentially changing?

1265
01:04:13.960 --> 01:04:18.500
<v 1>Oh,
okay.
So that's good.
So that have definitely changed.
I mean,
since,
you know,</v>

1266
01:04:18.550 --> 01:04:22.210
I guess 2010 that's when they really started getting super popular.
I mean,

1267
01:04:22.450 --> 01:04:26.260
in the last eight years the world has literally changed or I like everybody

1268
01:04:26.261 --> 01:04:28.690
carries a computer around and that's normal.
I mean,

1269
01:04:28.691 --> 01:04:31.270
that is such a huge change in society.

1270
01:04:31.271 --> 01:04:33.760
I think we're still dealing with a lot of the positive,

1271
01:04:33.761 --> 01:04:36.220
negative ramifications of that.
Right?
Like everybody's connected all the time.

1272
01:04:36.221 --> 01:04:39.730
Everybody's on the computer all the time.
That was my dream world as a geek.

1273
01:04:39.731 --> 01:04:42.640
Right.
But it's like be careful what you ask for,
right?
Like wow.

1274
01:04:42.700 --> 01:04:44.080
Now everybody has a computer.

1275
01:04:44.081 --> 01:04:46.630
It's not quite the utopia that we thought it would be.
Right.

1276
01:04:46.960 --> 01:04:51.100
Computers can be used for a lot of stuff that's not necessarily great.
Um,

1277
01:04:51.130 --> 01:04:54.310
so to me that's the central focus of the smartphone is just that it puts a

1278
01:04:54.311 --> 01:04:57.130
computer in front of everyone.
Granted a small touchscreen,

1279
01:04:57.160 --> 01:05:00.480
smallish touchscreen computer.
But as for programming,
like I dunno,

1280
01:05:00.520 --> 01:05:04.930
I don't think that I've kind of overtime come to subscribe to the Unix view of

1281
01:05:04.931 --> 01:05:06.070
the world when it comes to programming.

1282
01:05:06.071 --> 01:05:10.810
It's like you want to teach these basic command line things and that is just

1283
01:05:10.811 --> 01:05:13.990
what program is going to be for I think a long,
long time.

1284
01:05:14.380 --> 01:05:18.010
I don't think there's any magical like visual programming that's going to
happen.

1285
01:05:18.370 --> 01:05:20.860
Um,
I just,
I don't know.
I've,

1286
01:05:20.861 --> 01:05:23.920
I've overtime if it become a believer in that unix philosophy,
it was just,

1287
01:05:23.921 --> 01:05:25.870
you know,
they,
they kind of had it right.
With unix.

1288
01:05:26.380 --> 01:05:28.900
That's going to be the way it is for a long,
long time.

1289
01:05:28.901 --> 01:05:31.510
And what we'll continue to,
like I said,
raise the baseline,

1290
01:05:31.540 --> 01:05:32.980
the tools will get better,
it'll get simpler,

1291
01:05:32.981 --> 01:05:35.860
but it's still fundamentally going to be command line tools,
you know,

1292
01:05:35.861 --> 01:05:39.190
may fancy ideas.
That's kind of it for the foreseeable future.

1293
01:05:39.191 --> 01:05:42.640
I'm not seeing any visual programming stuff on the horizon because you kind of

1294
01:05:42.641 --> 01:05:42.911
think like,

1295
01:05:42.911 --> 01:05:46.120
what do you do on a smartphone that will be directly analogist to programming?

1296
01:05:46.390 --> 01:05:49.480
Like I'm trying to think,
right?
Like,
and there's really not much

1297
01:05:52.170 --> 01:05:55.140
<v 0>so,
uh,
not necessarily analogous to programming,</v>

1298
01:05:55.141 --> 01:06:00.141
but the kind of things that the kind of programs do we need to,

1299
01:06:02.101 --> 01:06:06.210
right.
My need to be very different.

1300
01:06:07.090 --> 01:06:07.310
<v 3>Yeah.</v>

1301
01:06:07.310 --> 01:06:09.710
<v 0>Yeah.
And the kind of languages,
I mean,</v>

1302
01:06:09.711 --> 01:06:12.140
but I probably also subscribed to the same,

1303
01:06:12.250 --> 01:06:16.150
it's just because everything in this world might be written in javascript.
Uh,

1304
01:06:16.500 --> 01:06:18.430
<v 1>Oh yeah,
that's definite.
That's already happening.
I mean,
just courses.</v>

1305
01:06:18.440 --> 01:06:19.770
A bet on discourse is itself.

1306
01:06:19.780 --> 01:06:21.840
Javascript is another bet on that side of the table.
And I,

1307
01:06:21.850 --> 01:06:23.370
I still trying and believe in that.

1308
01:06:23.580 --> 01:06:26.100
So I would say smartphones have been mostly a cultural shift more than a

1309
01:06:26.101 --> 01:06:27.000
programming shift.

1310
01:06:27.960 --> 01:06:31.980
Now your other question was about artificial intelligence and like sort of vices

1311
01:06:31.981 --> 01:06:33.030
predicting what you're going to do.

1312
01:06:33.031 --> 01:06:34.590
And I do think there's some strengths to that.

1313
01:06:34.591 --> 01:06:37.520
I think artificial intelligence kind of overselling it in terms of what it's

1314
01:06:37.521 --> 01:06:40.410
doing.
It's more like PR people are predictable,
right?
People do the same things.

1315
01:06:40.680 --> 01:06:43.530
Like,
let me give you an example.
One,
one check.

1316
01:06:43.531 --> 01:06:46.450
We put in a discourse that's in a lot of big uh,

1317
01:06:46.500 --> 01:06:50.610
commercial websites is say you log in from New York City.
No.

1318
01:06:51.120 --> 01:06:55.110
And then an hour later you log in from San Francisco.
It's like,
well,
hmm,

1319
01:06:55.140 --> 01:06:59.670
that's interesting.
How did you get from New York to San Francisco in one hour?

1320
01:06:59.790 --> 01:07:02.640
So at that point you're like,
okay,
this is a suspicious login at that point.

1321
01:07:02.641 --> 01:07:05.340
So we would alert you.
It was like,
okay,
but that's an AI,
right?

1322
01:07:05.341 --> 01:07:06.780
That's just a heuristic of like,

1323
01:07:07.260 --> 01:07:12.000
how did you in one hour get 2000 miles,
right?
That doesn't mean you grant,

1324
01:07:12.001 --> 01:07:13.520
maybe you're on a VPN,
there's other races happened.

1325
01:07:13.530 --> 01:07:17.190
But that's just a basic prediction based on the idea that people pretty much

1326
01:07:17.191 --> 01:07:21.560
don't move around that much.
Like they may travel occasionally,
but like nobody,

1327
01:07:21.570 --> 01:07:22.950
I mean unless you're a traveling salesman,

1328
01:07:22.951 --> 01:07:25.350
that's literally what traveling the world every day.

1329
01:07:25.500 --> 01:07:29.280
Like there's so much repetition and predictability in terms of things you're

1330
01:07:29.281 --> 01:07:31.560
going to do and I think good software anticipates your needs.

1331
01:07:31.890 --> 01:07:33.180
Like for example Google,

1332
01:07:33.210 --> 01:07:35.300
I think it's called Google now or whatever the Google thing is,

1333
01:07:35.301 --> 01:07:37.710
it predicts your commute and predict them based on your phone location.

1334
01:07:37.710 --> 01:07:40.560
Like where are you every day?
Well that's probably where you work.

1335
01:07:41.370 --> 01:07:44.050
That kind of stuff.
I do think computers can get a lot better at that,
but I,

1336
01:07:44.051 --> 01:07:46.290
I hesitate to call it like full blown Ai.

1337
01:07:46.291 --> 01:07:49.400
It's just computers getting better at like first of all they have a tendency

1338
01:07:49.420 --> 01:07:52.200
because everyone has a smartphone now all of a sudden we have all this data that

1339
01:07:52.201 --> 01:07:54.870
we didn't have before about location,
about like you know,

1340
01:07:54.871 --> 01:07:58.030
communication and feeding that into some,

1341
01:07:58.060 --> 01:08:01.230
some basic heuristics and maybe some fancy algorithms that turn it into

1342
01:08:01.231 --> 01:08:04.650
predictions of anticipating your needs.
Like,
like a friend would write like,

1343
01:08:04.680 --> 01:08:07.680
Oh hey,
I see your home.
Would you like some dinner?
Right?
Like,

1344
01:08:07.740 --> 01:08:10.080
let's go get some food because that's usually what we do at this time of day.

1345
01:08:10.081 --> 01:08:13.440
Right.
In the context of actually the act of programming,

1346
01:08:13.620 --> 01:08:17.120
do you see ids improving and making the life of programming is better?

1347
01:08:17.450 --> 01:08:20.390
I do think that is possible because there's a lot of repetition in programming,

1348
01:08:20.510 --> 01:08:23.680
right?
Oh,
you know,
clippy would be the bad example of,
Oh,
I see.

1349
01:08:23.681 --> 01:08:27.650
It looks like you're writing a four loop.
Um,
but there are patterns in code,

1350
01:08:27.651 --> 01:08:30.350
right?
Like in,
and actually libraries are kind of like that,
right?

1351
01:08:30.351 --> 01:08:35.351
Like rather than go code up your own http request library,

1352
01:08:35.421 --> 01:08:35.781
it's like,
well,

1353
01:08:35.781 --> 01:08:39.460
you'd use one of the existing ones that we have that's already troubleshot,

1354
01:08:39.470 --> 01:08:42.120
right?
Like not AI per se,
it's just,
you know,

1355
01:08:43.280 --> 01:08:44.780
building better lego bricks,

1356
01:08:44.810 --> 01:08:48.620
bigger lego bricks that have more functionality in them so people don't have to

1357
01:08:48.621 --> 01:08:51.650
worry about the low level stuff as much anymore.
Like wordpress,
for example,

1358
01:08:51.680 --> 01:08:56.240
to me is like a tool for somebody who isn't a programmer to do something.
I mean,

1359
01:08:56.270 --> 01:08:57.650
you can turn word press into anything.

1360
01:08:57.651 --> 01:08:59.510
It's kind of crazy actually through the plugins.
Right.

1361
01:08:59.511 --> 01:09:01.100
And that's not programming per se.

1362
01:09:01.340 --> 01:09:04.520
It's just lego bricks stacking wordpress elements.
Right.

1363
01:09:04.521 --> 01:09:06.080
And a little bit of configuration glue.

1364
01:09:06.560 --> 01:09:09.020
So I would say maybe in a broader sense what I'm seeing,

1365
01:09:09.021 --> 01:09:14.021
like there'll be more gluing and less like actual programming and that's a good

1366
01:09:14.691 --> 01:09:17.570
thing,
right?
Because most of the stuff you need is kind of out there already.

1367
01:09:18.010 --> 01:09:22.810
<v 2>You said 19 seventy's Unix,
you see PHB and these kind of</v>

1368
01:09:24.200 --> 01:09:25.033
<v 1>old</v>

1369
01:09:25.750 --> 01:09:29.780
<v 2>remnants of,
of the uh,</v>

1370
01:09:29.860 --> 01:09:34.210
early birth of programming remaining with us for a long time.
Like you said,

1371
01:09:34.211 --> 01:09:37.660
Unix in itself.
Do you see ultimately,
you know,

1372
01:09:37.661 --> 01:09:42.070
the stuff just being there out of momentum?

1373
01:09:42.910 --> 01:09:46.780
<v 1>I kind of do,
I mean I was a big believer in windows early on and I was a big,</v>

1374
01:09:46.820 --> 01:09:48.520
you know,
I was like Unix,
what a waste of time.

1375
01:09:48.730 --> 01:09:50.560
But over time I've completely flipped on that where I was like,
okay,

1376
01:09:50.561 --> 01:09:53.500
the Unix guys were right and pretty much Microsoft and windows were kind of

1377
01:09:53.501 --> 01:09:56.770
wrong,
at least on the server side,
not on the desktop.
Right.

1378
01:09:56.771 --> 01:09:58.560
You need a gooey know all that stuff.
And yeah,

1379
01:09:58.580 --> 01:10:02.530
the two philosophies like apple built on Unix effectively Darwin,
um,

1380
01:10:02.620 --> 01:10:04.570
and on the desktop is a slightly different story,

1381
01:10:04.571 --> 01:10:07.480
but on the server side where you are going to be programming now it's question

1382
01:10:07.481 --> 01:10:08.430
where the programming's going to be.

1383
01:10:08.431 --> 01:10:11.800
I was going to be a lot more like client side programming because technically

1384
01:10:11.801 --> 01:10:14.470
discourses client side programming,
the way you get discourse,

1385
01:10:14.471 --> 01:10:18.190
we deliver a big ball of javascript which is the next cue locally.
Um,

1386
01:10:18.191 --> 01:10:21.640
so we were really using a lot more local computing power will still retrieve the

1387
01:10:21.641 --> 01:10:24.280
data.
Obviously we have to display the posts on the screen and so forth.

1388
01:10:24.281 --> 01:10:27.820
But in terms of like sorting and a lot of the basic stuff we're using the host

1389
01:10:27.821 --> 01:10:29.380
processor,
um,

1390
01:10:29.410 --> 01:10:32.620
but to the extent that a lot of programming is still going to be server side,

1391
01:10:33.010 --> 01:10:33.641
I would say.
Yeah,

1392
01:10:33.641 --> 01:10:38.170
the UNIX philosophy definitely one and there'll be different veneers over the

1393
01:10:38.180 --> 01:10:40.810
Unix,
but it's still,
if you,
if you peel away one or two layers,

1394
01:10:40.811 --> 01:10:45.370
it's going to be Unix C for a long,
I think unix one I mean so definitively.

1395
01:10:45.520 --> 01:10:49.060
<v 2>It's interesting to hear you say that because you've done so much excellent work</v>

1396
01:10:49.061 --> 01:10:53.200
on the Microsoft end side in terms of backend development.
Cool.

1397
01:10:53.530 --> 01:10:57.350
So what's the future hold for Jeff Atwood Mba?

1398
01:10:57.750 --> 01:10:59.080
The discourse,

1399
01:10:59.110 --> 01:11:03.640
continuing the discourse in trying to improve conversation on the web.

1400
01:11:03.960 --> 01:11:06.600
<v 1>Well this course is that what I've read is a any originally I call it a five</v>

1401
01:11:06.601 --> 01:11:09.330
year project.
Then really quickly revise that your 10 year project.
So we're,

1402
01:11:09.720 --> 01:11:13.620
we started in early the 2013 that's when we launched the first version.

1403
01:11:13.621 --> 01:11:15.960
So we're still,
you know,
five years in.

1404
01:11:16.110 --> 01:11:17.370
This is the part where it starts getting good.

1405
01:11:17.371 --> 01:11:20.280
Like we have a good product now discourse.
There's any,

1406
01:11:20.580 --> 01:11:21.750
any project you built in software,

1407
01:11:21.751 --> 01:11:24.000
it takes three years to build what you wanted to build anyway.

1408
01:11:24.060 --> 01:11:26.220
Like v one is going to be terrible,
which it was,

1409
01:11:26.550 --> 01:11:28.800
but you ship in any way cause that's how you get better at stuff.

1410
01:11:28.950 --> 01:11:31.860
It's about turning the crank thought about v one being perfect because that's

1411
01:11:31.890 --> 01:11:36.000
ridiculous.
It's about v one then let's get really good at v 1.1 1.2,

1412
01:11:36.001 --> 01:11:37.740
1.3 like how fast can we iterate?

1413
01:11:37.980 --> 01:11:40.110
And I think we're iterating like crazy on discourse.

1414
01:11:40.120 --> 01:11:44.220
The point that like it's a really good product.
Now we have serious momentum.
Um,

1415
01:11:44.610 --> 01:11:48.120
and my original vision was I want to be the wordpress of discussion.

1416
01:11:48.121 --> 01:11:50.730
Meaning someone came to you and said,
I want to start a blog.

1417
01:11:50.760 --> 01:11:54.450
Although the very question is kind of archaic now it's like who actually blogs

1418
01:11:54.780 --> 01:11:56.250
anymore?
But uh,

1419
01:11:56.280 --> 01:12:01.280
I wanted the answer to that to be it would be w d a wordpress normally cause

1420
01:12:01.531 --> 01:12:04.710
that's the obvious choice for blogging most of the time.
Uh,
but if someone said,

1421
01:12:04.711 --> 01:12:08.760
hey,
I want to,
I need a group of people to get together and do something,

1422
01:12:08.761 --> 01:12:10.410
the answer should be discourse,
right?

1423
01:12:10.411 --> 01:12:13.050
That should be the default answer for people because it's open source.
It's free,

1424
01:12:13.350 --> 01:12:15.930
it doesn't cost you anything.
You control it,
you can run it.
Um,

1425
01:12:15.960 --> 01:12:19.530
your minimum server cross for discourse is five bucks a month at this point.
Um,

1426
01:12:19.560 --> 01:12:21.510
they actually got the vps prices down.

1427
01:12:21.511 --> 01:12:23.850
It used to be $10 a month for one gigabyte of Ram,

1428
01:12:23.851 --> 01:12:28.410
which we were are dependent.
We have a kind of heavy stack.

1429
01:12:28.411 --> 01:12:31.740
Like there's a lot of stuff in discourse.
You need PostgreSQL,
you need Reddis,

1430
01:12:31.741 --> 01:12:35.460
you need ruby on rails.
Um,
you need a sidekick for scheduling.

1431
01:12:35.730 --> 01:12:38.160
It's not a trivial amount of stuff cause we were architected for like,
look,

1432
01:12:38.161 --> 01:12:41.940
we're building for the next 10 years.
I don't care about shared PHP hosting.

1433
01:12:41.941 --> 01:12:45.270
That's,
that's not my model.
My idea is like,
hey,
you know,

1434
01:12:45.271 --> 01:12:48.300
eventually this is going to be very cheap for everybody and I want to build it

1435
01:12:48.301 --> 01:12:53.250
right.
Using again,
you know,
higher,
bigger building block levels,

1436
01:12:53.251 --> 01:12:54.290
right.
That have more required

1437
01:12:54.380 --> 01:12:59.060
<v 0>and there's a wordpress model of wordpress.org wordpress.com is there a central</v>

1438
01:12:59.061 --> 01:13:00.500
hosting for discourse or no,

1439
01:13:00.980 --> 01:13:01.371
<v 1>there is.</v>

1440
01:13:01.371 --> 01:13:04.910
We're not strictly segmenting into the open source versus the commercial side.

1441
01:13:05.090 --> 01:13:06.020
We have a hosting business.

1442
01:13:06.021 --> 01:13:09.070
That's how discourse makes money is we host discourse instances and we have

1443
01:13:09.080 --> 01:13:13.460
really close relationship with our customers of the symbiosis of them giving us

1444
01:13:13.461 --> 01:13:14.420
feedback on the product.

1445
01:13:14.630 --> 01:13:18.050
We definitely wait feedback from customers a lot heavier than feedback from

1446
01:13:18.080 --> 01:13:20.870
somebody who just wanders by and gives feedback.
Uh,

1447
01:13:20.871 --> 01:13:24.430
but that's where we make all our money.
But we don't have a strict division.
Um,

1448
01:13:24.620 --> 01:13:28.010
we encourage people to use discourse.
Like the whole point is that it's free,

1449
01:13:28.310 --> 01:13:29.930
right?
Anybody can set it up.

1450
01:13:29.960 --> 01:13:32.570
I don't want to be the only person that hosts discourse.

1451
01:13:32.571 --> 01:13:33.830
That's absolutely not the goal,

1452
01:13:34.160 --> 01:13:36.260
but it is a primary way for us to build a business.

1453
01:13:36.261 --> 01:13:38.870
And it's actually kind of a great business.
I mean,
the business is going really,

1454
01:13:38.871 --> 01:13:41.180
really well in terms of hosting.

1455
01:13:41.310 --> 01:13:42.570
<v 0>So I,
uh,</v>

1456
01:13:42.720 --> 01:13:46.320
I used to work at Google research as a company and is basically funded on an

1457
01:13:46.321 --> 01:13:49.860
advertisement.
So is Facebook,
let me,
let me ask if you can comment on it.

1458
01:13:50.370 --> 01:13:52.830
I think advertisement is best.

1459
01:13:53.460 --> 01:13:57.570
So you'd be extremely critical on what ads are.
But at its best,

1460
01:13:57.600 --> 01:14:01.170
it's actually serving you in a sense.
It's giving you,

1461
01:14:01.171 --> 01:14:05.610
it's connecting you to what you would want to explore.

1462
01:14:05.640 --> 01:14:08.480
So it's like related posts to related content is the same.

1463
01:14:08.490 --> 01:14:12.610
That's the best of advertisement.
So discourse is

1464
01:14:12.960 --> 01:14:15.640
<v 1>a connecting people based on their interest.</v>

1465
01:14:16.030 --> 01:14:21.030
It seems like a place where advertisement at its best could actually serve the

1466
01:14:21.251 --> 01:14:21.731
users.

1467
01:14:21.731 --> 01:14:26.170
Is that something that you're considering thinking about as a way to bring,

1468
01:14:26.230 --> 01:14:30.820
um,
to financially support the platform?
That's interesting because I agree.

1469
01:14:30.821 --> 01:14:33.520
I actually have a contrarian view of advertising,
which I kind of agree with you.

1470
01:14:33.760 --> 01:14:37.780
I recently installed that blocker like reluctantly because I don't like to do

1471
01:14:37.781 --> 01:14:40.150
that,
but like the performance of the ads man,

1472
01:14:40.220 --> 01:14:43.120
like they're so heavy now and like it's just crazy.

1473
01:14:43.240 --> 01:14:46.540
So like it's almost like a performance argument more than like I actually am pro

1474
01:14:46.541 --> 01:14:50.140
ads and I,
contrary,
I have a contrarian viewpoint.
I agree with you.

1475
01:14:50.320 --> 01:14:53.080
If you do ads right,
it's showing you stuff you'd be interested in any way.

1476
01:14:53.110 --> 01:14:56.290
I don't mind that.
That actually was kind of good thing.

1477
01:14:56.500 --> 01:14:58.350
So plus I think it's,

1478
01:14:58.351 --> 01:15:01.870
it's rational to want to support the people that are doing this work through

1479
01:15:01.871 --> 01:15:04.030
seeing their ads.
And,
but that said,
I run ad block now,

1480
01:15:04.031 --> 01:15:08.710
which I I didn't want to do but I was convinced by all these artists like 30,

1481
01:15:08.720 --> 01:15:12.610
40 megabytes of stuff just to serve you ads.
Um,
yeah,

1482
01:15:12.611 --> 01:15:16.600
it feels like as now or like the experts exchange of a,

1483
01:15:16.601 --> 01:15:19.540
whenever you started to stack overflow hose is a little bit,
it's all,

1484
01:15:19.541 --> 01:15:21.730
there's so many companies and ad tech though,
it's embarrassing.

1485
01:15:21.731 --> 01:15:24.370
Like you can do that if you see this logo charts of like just the whole page is

1486
01:15:24.371 --> 01:15:26.050
like you can't even see them.
They're so small.

1487
01:15:26.200 --> 01:15:28.930
There's so many companies in the space.
But since you brought it up,

1488
01:15:28.931 --> 01:15:30.100
I do want to point out that very,

1489
01:15:30.101 --> 01:15:32.950
very few discourse sites actually run using an ad supported model.

1490
01:15:33.070 --> 01:15:37.420
It's not effective.
Like it's too diluted.
It's too weird.

1491
01:15:37.600 --> 01:15:40.420
It doesn't pay well and like users hate it.

1492
01:15:40.510 --> 01:15:42.520
So it's a combination of like users hate it.

1493
01:15:42.790 --> 01:15:45.250
It doesn't actually work that well in practice.
Like in theory,
yes,

1494
01:15:45.251 --> 01:15:45.710
I agree with you.

1495
01:15:45.710 --> 01:15:49.480
If he had clean fast ads that were exactly the stuff you would be interested in.

1496
01:15:49.630 --> 01:15:53.770
Awesome.
We're so far from that though,
right?
Like Google does an okay job,

1497
01:15:53.800 --> 01:15:57.850
they retargeting and stuff like that.
But in the,
in the real world,

1498
01:15:58.060 --> 01:16:01.000
discourse sites rarely can make ads work.

1499
01:16:01.001 --> 01:16:03.250
It just doesn't work for so many reasons.
But you know,

1500
01:16:03.251 --> 01:16:08.200
what does work is subscriptions Patrion uh,

1501
01:16:08.890 --> 01:16:11.800
affiliate codes for like Amazon of like just oh here,

1502
01:16:11.830 --> 01:16:14.800
here's a cool Yoyo Click and then you click and go to Amazon and they get a

1503
01:16:14.801 --> 01:16:17.290
small percentage of that,
which is fair I think.
I mean,

1504
01:16:17.291 --> 01:16:20.800
cause you saw the Yoyo on that site and you click through and you bought it.

1505
01:16:20.801 --> 01:16:21.041
Right.

1506
01:16:21.041 --> 01:16:23.860
And that's fair for them to get 5% of that or 2% of that or whatever it is.

1507
01:16:24.160 --> 01:16:28.510
Those things definitely work.
In fact,
a site that I used to participate on a lot,

1508
01:16:28.570 --> 01:16:32.410
I help the owner.
One of the things I,
I got them switched to discourse.

1509
01:16:32.411 --> 01:16:34.690
I basically paid them to switch to discourse cause I was like,
look,

1510
01:16:34.691 --> 01:16:38.140
you guys gotta switch.
I can't come here anymore on this terrible software.
Um,

1511
01:16:38.470 --> 01:16:40.120
but I was like,
look.
And on top of that,

1512
01:16:40.121 --> 01:16:42.190
like you're serving people ads that they hate.

1513
01:16:42.250 --> 01:16:44.790
Like you should just go full on Patriot because he had a little bit of Patriot

1514
01:16:44.791 --> 01:16:49.791
on go fall on Patrion do the Amazon affiliates thing for any Amazon links they

1515
01:16:50.531 --> 01:16:53.440
get posted and just do that and just triple down on that stuff.

1516
01:16:53.740 --> 01:16:56.650
And that's worked really well for them in this creator in particular.

1517
01:16:56.740 --> 01:16:59.380
So that stuff works.
But traditional ads,

1518
01:16:59.470 --> 01:17:02.620
I mean definitely not working at least on discourse.
So the last question,

1519
01:17:03.370 --> 01:17:05.020
you've created the code keyboard.

1520
01:17:05.920 --> 01:17:09.010
I've program most of my adult life and it can nieces keyboard.

1521
01:17:09.830 --> 01:17:11.360
I have one upstairs now.

1522
01:17:12.080 --> 01:17:15.560
Can you describe what a mechanical keyboard is and why is it something that

1523
01:17:15.561 --> 01:17:18.740
makes you happy?
Well,
you know,
this is another fetish item really,

1524
01:17:18.800 --> 01:17:22.220
like not required.
You can do programming on any kind of keyboard,
right?

1525
01:17:22.221 --> 01:17:26.060
Even like an onscreen keyboard.
Oh God,
that's terrifying,
right?
Like,
well,

1526
01:17:26.061 --> 01:17:28.730
you could touch,
I mean if you look back to the early,
it is competing.

1527
01:17:28.731 --> 01:17:31.370
There were chicklet keyboards,
which are,
I mean those are awful,
right?

1528
01:17:31.371 --> 01:17:33.380
But what's the look you were,
oh God.
Okay.

1529
01:17:33.381 --> 01:17:38.120
Well it's just like fit and rubber membranes or the rubber ones.
Oh No,
super bad.

1530
01:17:38.121 --> 01:17:41.720
Right?
Yeah.
So it's a fetish item.
All it really says is,
look,

1531
01:17:41.870 --> 01:17:44.630
I care really about keyboards because the keyboard is the primary method of

1532
01:17:44.631 --> 01:17:45.800
communication with the computer,
right?

1533
01:17:46.190 --> 01:17:48.980
So it's just like having a nice mic for this,
this podcast.

1534
01:17:49.280 --> 01:17:52.160
You want a nice keyboard,
right?
Cause it has t very tactile feel.

1535
01:17:52.161 --> 01:17:55.220
I can tell exactly when I pressed the key,
I get that little click.
So,

1536
01:17:55.250 --> 01:17:58.490
oh and it feels good.
And it's also kind of a fetish shot.
It was like,
wow,

1537
01:17:58.670 --> 01:18:01.550
I care enough about programming that I care about the tool,

1538
01:18:01.580 --> 01:18:03.290
the primary tool that he's coming with a computer.

1539
01:18:03.291 --> 01:18:05.990
Make sure it's as good as it feels good to use for me.

1540
01:18:06.350 --> 01:18:09.710
And like I can be very productive with it.
So to be honest,

1541
01:18:09.711 --> 01:18:10.670
it's a little bit of a fetish item,

1542
01:18:10.671 --> 01:18:13.400
but a good one and indicates that you're serious and in case you're interested,

1543
01:18:13.590 --> 01:18:16.310
it indicates that you care about the fundamentals because you don't what makes

1544
01:18:16.311 --> 01:18:19.880
you good programmer being able to type really fast,
right?
Like this is true,

1545
01:18:19.910 --> 01:18:20.570
right?

1546
01:18:20.570 --> 01:18:24.410
So a core skill is just being able to type fast enough to get your ideas out of

1547
01:18:24.411 --> 01:18:25.700
your head into the code base.

1548
01:18:26.090 --> 01:18:29.150
So just practicing your typing can make you a better programmer.

1549
01:18:29.610 --> 01:18:34.130
It is also something that makes you well,

1550
01:18:34.220 --> 01:18:38.030
makes you enjoy typing.
Correct.
The actual act,
uh,

1551
01:18:38.180 --> 01:18:41.930
something about the process.
Like I played piano,
it's tactile,

1552
01:18:42.050 --> 01:18:46.940
there's a tactile feel that ultimately feeds the passion.
Makes you happy,

1553
01:18:47.030 --> 01:18:48.620
right?
No,
totally.
That's it.
I mean and,

1554
01:18:48.621 --> 01:18:50.690
and it's funny cause artisanal keyboards have exploded.

1555
01:18:50.691 --> 01:18:53.150
Like Massdrop has gone ballistic with this stuff.

1556
01:18:53.450 --> 01:18:57.290
There's probably like 500 keyboard projects on Massdrop alone and there's some

1557
01:18:57.291 --> 01:18:58.900
other guy I follow on Twitter.
I used to write for this,

1558
01:18:58.901 --> 01:19:01.910
the site of the tech report way back in the day.
And he's like,

1559
01:19:01.911 --> 01:19:05.030
every week he's just posting like what I called keyboard porn of like just cool

1560
01:19:05.031 --> 01:19:06.620
keyboards.
Like,
oh my God,
those look really cool.
Right?

1561
01:19:06.621 --> 01:19:10.690
Like that's like how many keyboards this guy has.
It's got me with Yoyos.

1562
01:19:10.730 --> 01:19:13.520
How many videos do you have?
How many do you need?
Well technically one,

1563
01:19:13.700 --> 01:19:17.630
but I like a lot.
I don't know why.
So same thing with keyboards.
So yeah,

1564
01:19:18.020 --> 01:19:18.920
they're awesome.

1565
01:19:18.921 --> 01:19:22.520
Like I highly recommend anybody that doesn't have a mechanical to research it.

1566
01:19:22.521 --> 01:19:26.300
Look into it and see what you like and you know,
it's ultimately a fetish item.

1567
01:19:26.301 --> 01:19:28.850
But I think these sort of items,

1568
01:19:28.851 --> 01:19:32.570
these religious artifacts that we have are part of what make us human like that.

1569
01:19:32.571 --> 01:19:35.510
That part's important,
right?
It's kind of what makes life worth living.

1570
01:19:36.980 --> 01:19:38.870
It's not necessary in the strictest sense,

1571
01:19:38.871 --> 01:19:43.760
but ain't nothing necessary if you think about that.
Right?
Like so,
yeah.

1572
01:19:43.761 --> 01:19:48.050
Why not so sure.
Jeff,
thank you so much for talking today.
Yeah,
you're welcome.

1573
01:19:48.350 --> 01:19:48.830
Thanks for having me.
