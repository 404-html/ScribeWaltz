00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:02.690
<v Speaker 1>Welcome back to six zero,</v>
<v Speaker 1>nine,</v>

2
00:00:02.691 --> 00:00:07.691
<v Speaker 1>nine artificial general intelligence.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Today we have Richard Moise.</v>

3
00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.180
<v Speaker 1>He's the founder and managing director </v>
<v Speaker 1>of article 36,</v>

4
00:00:11.630 --> 00:00:16.630
<v Speaker 1>a UK based not for profit organization,</v>
<v Speaker 1>working to prevent the unintended,</v>

5
00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:21.800
<v Speaker 1>unnecessary and unacceptable harm caused</v>
<v Speaker 1>by certain weapons,</v>

6
00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:25.400
<v Speaker 1>including autonomous weapons and nuclear</v>
<v Speaker 1>weapons.</v>

7
00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:31.150
<v Speaker 1>He will talk with us today about </v>
<v Speaker 1>autonomous weapon systems and the </v>

8
00:00:31.150 --> 00:00:35.351
<v Speaker 1>context of Ai Safety.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is an extremely important topic for</v>

9
00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:39.230
<v Speaker 1>engineers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>humanitarians,</v>

10
00:00:39.231 --> 00:00:40.850
<v Speaker 1>legal minds,</v>
<v Speaker 1>policymakers,</v>

11
00:00:40.851 --> 00:00:45.851
<v Speaker 1>and everybody involved in paving the </v>
<v Speaker 1>path for a safe,</v>

12
00:00:46.071 --> 00:00:51.071
<v Speaker 1>positive future for ai in our society,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which I hope is what this course is </v>

13
00:00:51.831 --> 00:00:56.831
<v Speaker 1>about.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Richard flew all the way from the UK to </v>

14
00:00:56.831 --> 00:01:00.410
<v Speaker 1>visit us today in snow in Massachusetts,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so please give him a warm welcome.</v>

15
00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:07.520
<v Speaker 2>Thank you.</v>

16
00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:11.160
<v Speaker 3>Thanks very much lex and thank you all </v>
<v Speaker 3>for coming out.</v>

17
00:01:11.470 --> 00:01:12.630
<v Speaker 3>I was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like I said,</v>

18
00:01:12.631 --> 00:01:15.210
<v Speaker 3>I work for a not for profit organization</v>
<v Speaker 3>based in the UK.</v>

19
00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:20.420
<v Speaker 3>We specialize in thinking about policy </v>
<v Speaker 3>and legal frameworks around weapon </v>

20
00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:24.540
<v Speaker 3>technologies particularly and generally </v>
<v Speaker 3>about how to establish more constraining</v>

21
00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:29.960
<v Speaker 3>policy and legal frameworks around </v>
<v Speaker 3>around weapons and I guess I'm mainly </v>

22
00:01:31.171 --> 00:01:36.171
<v Speaker 3>going to talk today about these issues </v>
<v Speaker 3>of to what extent we should enable </v>

23
00:01:36.171 --> 00:01:40.440
<v Speaker 3>machines to kill people to make </v>
<v Speaker 3>decisions to kill people.</v>

24
00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:41.830
<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think,</v>

25
00:01:41.831 --> 00:01:45.360
<v Speaker 3>a conceptually very interesting topic.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Quite challenging in lots of ways.</v>

26
00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:50.960
<v Speaker 3>There's lots of unstable terminology,</v>
<v Speaker 3>lots of sort of blurry boundaries.</v>

27
00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:57.710
<v Speaker 3>My own background,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the sidewalk on weapons policy issues </v>

28
00:01:57.710 --> 00:01:59.280
<v Speaker 3>that I've worked on,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the development of have two legal,</v>

29
00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:03.030
<v Speaker 3>international legal treaties prohibiting</v>
<v Speaker 3>certain types of weapons.</v>

30
00:02:03.031 --> 00:02:06.870
<v Speaker 3>I worked on the development of 2008 </v>
<v Speaker 3>convention on cluster munitions,</v>

31
00:02:06.871 --> 00:02:11.190
<v Speaker 3>which prohibits cluster bombs and worked</v>
<v Speaker 3>on our organization.</v>

32
00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:14.640
<v Speaker 3>Pyre pioneered the idea of a treaty </v>
<v Speaker 3>prohibition on nuclear weapons,</v>

33
00:02:14.641 --> 00:02:19.641
<v Speaker 3>which was agreed last year in the UN and</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're part of the steering group of </v>

34
00:02:19.641 --> 00:02:24.441
<v Speaker 3>Icann,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the international campaign to abolish </v>

35
00:02:24.441 --> 00:02:26.151
<v Speaker 3>nuclear weapons,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which won the Nobel peace prize last </v>

36
00:02:26.151 --> 00:02:26.151
<v Speaker 3>year,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so that was a good year for us.</v>

37
00:02:26.490 --> 00:02:31.490
<v Speaker 3>The issue of autonomous weapons,</v>
<v Speaker 3>killer robots which are going to talk </v>

38
00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:33.240
<v Speaker 3>about the day.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're also part of an NGO,</v>

39
00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:38.270
<v Speaker 3>nongovernmental organization coalition </v>
<v Speaker 3>on this issue called the campaign to </v>

40
00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:39.450
<v Speaker 3>stop killer robots.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a good name.</v>

41
00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:45.830
<v Speaker 3>However,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think when we get into some of the </v>

42
00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:47.930
<v Speaker 3>details of the issue,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we'll find that perhaps the snappiness </v>

43
00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:51.891
<v Speaker 3>of the name in a way masks some of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>complexity that lies underneath this,</v>

44
00:02:55.020 --> 00:02:57.720
<v Speaker 3>but this is a live issue in </v>
<v Speaker 3>international policy,</v>

45
00:02:57.721 --> 00:03:02.320
<v Speaker 3>in legal discussions at the United </v>
<v Speaker 3>Nations for the last several years,</v>

46
00:03:02.321 --> 00:03:06.760
<v Speaker 3>three or four years now that are being </v>
<v Speaker 3>groups of governments coming together to</v>

47
00:03:06.761 --> 00:03:11.761
<v Speaker 3>discuss autonomous weapons and whether </v>
<v Speaker 3>or not there should be some new legal </v>

48
00:03:11.761 --> 00:03:12.180
<v Speaker 3>instrument that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

49
00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:14.230
<v Speaker 3>the tackles this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this issue.</v>

50
00:03:14.230 --> 00:03:19.230
<v Speaker 3>So it's a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's a live political issue that is </v>

51
00:03:19.230 --> 00:03:19.660
<v Speaker 3>being debated in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in policy,</v>

52
00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:22.490
<v Speaker 3>legal circles.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And really my,</v>

53
00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:25.420
<v Speaker 3>my comments a day are going to be </v>
<v Speaker 3>speaking to that context.</v>

54
00:03:25.421 --> 00:03:30.421
<v Speaker 3>I guess I'm going to try and give us a </v>
<v Speaker 3>bit of a briefing about what the issues </v>

55
00:03:31.121 --> 00:03:33.640
<v Speaker 3>are in this international debate,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how different actors,</v>

56
00:03:33.641 --> 00:03:38.190
<v Speaker 3>a orientating to these issues.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Some of the conceptual models that we,</v>

57
00:03:38.540 --> 00:03:43.540
<v Speaker 3>we use in that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I'm not really going to give you a </v>

58
00:03:43.540 --> 00:03:44.920
<v Speaker 3>particular sales pitches to what you </v>
<v Speaker 3>should think about this issue though.</v>

59
00:03:45.130 --> 00:03:49.630
<v Speaker 3>My own biases are probably going to be </v>
<v Speaker 3>fairly evident during the process,</v>

60
00:03:50.140 --> 00:03:52.160
<v Speaker 3>but really to try and lay out a bit of a</v>
<v Speaker 3>sense of,</v>

61
00:03:52.180 --> 00:03:53.430
<v Speaker 3>of how these,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

62
00:03:53.620 --> 00:03:58.620
<v Speaker 3>these questions debated in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>international political scene and maybe </v>

63
00:03:58.620 --> 00:04:02.551
<v Speaker 3>in a way that's useful for reflecting on</v>
<v Speaker 3>sort of wider questions of how a AI </v>

64
00:04:03.011 --> 00:04:06.490
<v Speaker 3>technologies might be orientate it to an</v>
<v Speaker 3>approach by,</v>

65
00:04:06.491 --> 00:04:08.090
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>by policy makers and,</v>

66
00:04:08.110 --> 00:04:09.970
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and the legal framework.</v>

67
00:04:11.140 --> 00:04:13.390
<v Speaker 3>So in terms of the structure of my </v>
<v Speaker 3>comments,</v>

68
00:04:13.391 --> 00:04:18.391
<v Speaker 3>I'm gonna talk a bit about some of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>pros and cons that are put forward a </v>

69
00:04:18.391 --> 00:04:22.590
<v Speaker 3>around autonomous weapons or movements </v>
<v Speaker 3>towards greater autonomy in weapons </v>

70
00:04:22.590 --> 00:04:22.590
<v Speaker 3>systems.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

71
00:04:22.840 --> 00:04:26.150
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to talk a bit more about the </v>
<v Speaker 3>political legal framework within,</v>

72
00:04:26.170 --> 00:04:28.060
<v Speaker 3>within which these discussions are </v>
<v Speaker 3>taking place.</v>

73
00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:31.570
<v Speaker 3>And then I'm going to try to sort of lay</v>
<v Speaker 3>out some of the models,</v>

74
00:04:31.571 --> 00:04:35.320
<v Speaker 3>the conceptual models that we're as an </v>
<v Speaker 3>organization have developed and are sort</v>

75
00:04:35.321 --> 00:04:40.321
<v Speaker 3>of using a in relation to these issues.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And perhaps to reflect a bit on where I </v>

76
00:04:40.331 --> 00:04:42.160
<v Speaker 3>see the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the political conversation,</v>

77
00:04:42.161 --> 00:04:47.161
<v Speaker 3>the legal conversation on this going at </v>
<v Speaker 3>an international level and maybe just </v>

78
00:04:47.161 --> 00:04:51.601
<v Speaker 3>finally to try to reflect on or just </v>
<v Speaker 3>draw out some more general thoughts that</v>

79
00:04:53.111 --> 00:04:58.111
<v Speaker 3>I think occurred to me a about what some</v>
<v Speaker 3>of those says about thinking about ai </v>

80
00:04:58.240 --> 00:05:01.570
<v Speaker 3>functions in a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in different social social roles.</v>

81
00:05:02.160 --> 00:05:07.160
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but before getting into that sort of </v>

82
00:05:07.210 --> 00:05:12.210
<v Speaker 3>pros and cons type type stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just wanted to start by suggesting a </v>

83
00:05:12.761 --> 00:05:17.761
<v Speaker 3>bit of a sort of conceptual timeline </v>
<v Speaker 3>because one of the things this could be </v>

84
00:05:20.471 --> 00:05:25.471
<v Speaker 3>the president,</v>
<v Speaker 3>one of the things you find when we </v>

85
00:05:26.861 --> 00:05:31.861
<v Speaker 3>start,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when you say to somebody who will work </v>

86
00:05:31.861 --> 00:05:32.210
<v Speaker 3>on this issue of autonomous weapons,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they tend to orientate to it.</v>

87
00:05:32.211 --> 00:05:37.211
<v Speaker 3>And in two fairly distinct ways.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Some people will say,</v>

88
00:05:37.480 --> 00:05:39.700
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you mean om drones and you know,</v>

89
00:05:39.701 --> 00:05:42.940
<v Speaker 3>we know drones are they being used,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

90
00:05:42.941 --> 00:05:47.941
<v Speaker 3>in the world today.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that's kind of an issue here in the </v>

91
00:05:47.941 --> 00:05:47.941
<v Speaker 3>present.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

92
00:05:51.660 --> 00:05:54.640
<v Speaker 3>But other people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>most of the media,</v>

93
00:05:54.670 --> 00:05:59.670
<v Speaker 3>and certainly pretty much every media </v>
<v Speaker 3>photo editor thinks she talking about </v>

94
00:06:00.530 --> 00:06:05.530
<v Speaker 3>terminator of hair.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Maybe even a skynet thrown in,</v>

95
00:06:08.510 --> 00:06:12.980
<v Speaker 3>so this is a sort of advanced,</v>
<v Speaker 3>futuristic,</v>

96
00:06:13.040 --> 00:06:16.340
<v Speaker 3>Saifai orientation to the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to the issues.</v>

97
00:06:16.970 --> 00:06:19.030
<v Speaker 3>My thinking about this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I come from a background of,</v>

98
00:06:19.130 --> 00:06:21.980
<v Speaker 3>of working on the impact of weapons in </v>
<v Speaker 3>the present.</v>

99
00:06:23.330 --> 00:06:27.560
<v Speaker 3>I'm less,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm less concerned about this area of my</v>

100
00:06:27.800 --> 00:06:30.980
<v Speaker 3>thinking and my anxieties or concerns </v>
<v Speaker 3>around this issue.</v>

101
00:06:30.981 --> 00:06:33.410
<v Speaker 3>Don't come from,</v>
<v Speaker 3>from this area.</v>

102
00:06:33.870 --> 00:06:38.870
<v Speaker 3>I'll do this light a bit wiggly here </v>
<v Speaker 3>because I also don't want to suggest </v>

103
00:06:38.870 --> 00:06:38.870
<v Speaker 3>there's any kind of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

104
00:06:38.870 --> 00:06:43.540
<v Speaker 3>telia logical certainty going on here.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is just an imaginary timeline,</v>

105
00:06:45.800 --> 00:06:50.800
<v Speaker 3>but I think it's important just in terms</v>
<v Speaker 3>of situating where I'm coming from in </v>

106
00:06:50.800 --> 00:06:51.320
<v Speaker 3>the debate that I'm definitely not </v>
<v Speaker 3>starting at that end.</v>

107
00:06:51.650 --> 00:06:55.580
<v Speaker 3>And yet in the political discussion </v>
<v Speaker 3>amongst governments and states,</v>

108
00:06:55.880 --> 00:06:59.660
<v Speaker 3>well you have people come in and it all </v>
<v Speaker 3>sorts of different positions along here.</v>

109
00:06:59.660 --> 00:07:03.220
<v Speaker 3>Imagining a little autonomous weapons </v>
<v Speaker 3>may existed,</v>

110
00:07:03.280 --> 00:07:04.740
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>somewhere along this,</v>

111
00:07:04.741 --> 00:07:09.741
<v Speaker 3>this sort of spectrum.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I'm going to think more about stuff </v>

112
00:07:09.741 --> 00:07:13.751
<v Speaker 3>that's going on around here and how some</v>
<v Speaker 3>of our conceptual model is really built </v>

113
00:07:13.751 --> 00:07:16.570
<v Speaker 3>around some of this thinking.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Not so much actually armed drones,</v>

114
00:07:16.640 --> 00:07:18.080
<v Speaker 3>but some other,</v>
<v Speaker 3>some other systems.</v>

115
00:07:19.100 --> 00:07:24.100
<v Speaker 3>But my background before I started </v>
<v Speaker 3>working on policy and law around weapons</v>

116
00:07:24.921 --> 00:07:25.730
<v Speaker 3>was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

117
00:07:26.180 --> 00:07:31.180
<v Speaker 3>was setting up and managing landmine </v>
<v Speaker 3>clearance operations overseas and well,</v>

118
00:07:31.971 --> 00:07:36.260
<v Speaker 3>they'd been around for.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'd been around for quite a long time,</v>

119
00:07:36.290 --> 00:07:37.550
<v Speaker 3>like months.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

120
00:07:39.680 --> 00:07:42.830
<v Speaker 3>and I think it's interesting just to </v>
<v Speaker 3>start with,</v>

121
00:07:42.831 --> 00:07:46.540
<v Speaker 3>just to reflect on the basic </v>
<v Speaker 3>anti-personnel landmine.</v>

122
00:07:46.830 --> 00:07:48.710
<v Speaker 3>A simple,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it gives us,</v>

123
00:07:48.711 --> 00:07:53.711
<v Speaker 3>I think some sort of useful entry points</v>
<v Speaker 3>into thinking about what an autonomous </v>

124
00:07:53.711 --> 00:07:56.240
<v Speaker 3>weapon system might be in its most </v>
<v Speaker 3>simple form.</v>

125
00:07:56.930 --> 00:07:58.570
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if we think about a landmine,</v>

126
00:07:58.640 --> 00:08:03.640
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>essentially we have a person and as an </v>

127
00:08:06.141 --> 00:08:10.190
<v Speaker 3>input into the landmine and there's a </v>
<v Speaker 3>function that goes on here.</v>

128
00:08:11.850 --> 00:08:15.410
<v Speaker 3>Pressure is greater than x person.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They tried on the landmine.</v>

129
00:08:15.860 --> 00:08:19.670
<v Speaker 3>There's a basic mechanical algorithm </v>
<v Speaker 3>goes on and you get an output.</v>

130
00:08:22.320 --> 00:08:27.320
<v Speaker 3>That explosion that goes back against </v>
<v Speaker 3>the person who taught on the Lamont.</v>

131
00:08:29.270 --> 00:08:32.260
<v Speaker 3>So it's a fairly simple system of a </v>
<v Speaker 3>signal,</v>

132
00:08:32.290 --> 00:08:35.210
<v Speaker 3>a sensor taking a signal from the </v>
<v Speaker 3>outside world.</v>

133
00:08:35.240 --> 00:08:40.240
<v Speaker 3>The landmine is viewing the outside </v>
<v Speaker 3>world through its sensor to basic </v>

134
00:08:40.240 --> 00:08:42.890
<v Speaker 3>pressure plate and according to a </v>
<v Speaker 3>certain calculus here,</v>

135
00:08:43.100 --> 00:08:46.760
<v Speaker 3>you got output and it's directed back at</v>
<v Speaker 3>this person and it's a loop.</v>

136
00:08:47.060 --> 00:08:52.060
<v Speaker 3>And that's one of the things that I </v>
<v Speaker 3>think is fundamental essentially to </v>

137
00:08:52.060 --> 00:08:52.520
<v Speaker 3>understanding the idea of autonomous </v>
<v Speaker 3>weapons.</v>

138
00:08:52.521 --> 00:08:54.320
<v Speaker 3>And in a way this is where the autonomy </v>
<v Speaker 3>comes in,</v>

139
00:08:54.700 --> 00:08:58.560
<v Speaker 3>that there's no other person intervening</v>
<v Speaker 3>in this process at any point.</v>

140
00:08:58.790 --> 00:09:03.790
<v Speaker 3>There's just a sort of straightforward </v>
<v Speaker 3>relationship from the person or object </v>

141
00:09:04.141 --> 00:09:06.090
<v Speaker 3>that has initiated the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

142
00:09:06.590 --> 00:09:09.120
<v Speaker 3>the system back into the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

143
00:09:09.450 --> 00:09:11.910
<v Speaker 3>back into the effects that are being,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that are being applied.</v>

144
00:09:12.180 --> 00:09:17.180
<v Speaker 3>So in some ways,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we'll come back to this later and think </v>

145
00:09:17.180 --> 00:09:18.150
<v Speaker 3>about how some of the basic building </v>
<v Speaker 3>blocks of this,</v>

146
00:09:18.151 --> 00:09:23.151
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>maybe they're not thinking about other </v>

147
00:09:23.151 --> 00:09:26.061
<v Speaker 3>weapons systems and weapons technologies</v>
<v Speaker 3>as they're developing and maybe thinking</v>

148
00:09:26.761 --> 00:09:30.480
<v Speaker 3>about landmines and thinking about these</v>
<v Speaker 3>processes of technological change.</v>

149
00:09:30.840 --> 00:09:32.590
<v Speaker 3>We see a number of different,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

150
00:09:32.970 --> 00:09:36.180
<v Speaker 3>dynamics at play in this sort of </v>
<v Speaker 3>imaginary timeline.</v>

151
00:09:36.990 --> 00:09:39.240
<v Speaker 3>Anti personnel,</v>
<v Speaker 3>land mines of course a static.</v>

152
00:09:39.600 --> 00:09:41.850
<v Speaker 3>They just sit in the ground where you </v>
<v Speaker 3>left them.</v>

153
00:09:42.420 --> 00:09:45.630
<v Speaker 3>But we get more and more mobility </v>
<v Speaker 3>perhaps as we go through this system.</v>

154
00:09:45.631 --> 00:09:48.780
<v Speaker 3>Certainly drones and other systems that </v>
<v Speaker 3>I'll talk about,</v>

155
00:09:48.900 --> 00:09:52.020
<v Speaker 3>you start to see more mobility in the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in the weapon system.</v>

156
00:09:53.880 --> 00:09:57.300
<v Speaker 3>Perhaps greater sophistication of </v>
<v Speaker 3>sensors,</v>

157
00:09:57.390 --> 00:10:01.410
<v Speaker 3>I mean a a basic pressure plate.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just gauging,</v>

158
00:10:01.411 --> 00:10:06.411
<v Speaker 3>wait,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's a very simple a census structure </v>

159
00:10:06.411 --> 00:10:10.050
<v Speaker 3>for interrogating the world.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We have much more sophisticated a sensor</v>

160
00:10:10.051 --> 00:10:15.051
<v Speaker 3>systems and weapons now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So we have weapons systems now that are </v>

161
00:10:15.051 --> 00:10:18.351
<v Speaker 3>looking at radar signatures.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're looking at the heat shapes of </v>

162
00:10:18.351 --> 00:10:19.230
<v Speaker 3>objects and we'll come back and talk </v>
<v Speaker 3>about that.</v>

163
00:10:19.231 --> 00:10:22.680
<v Speaker 3>But more sophistication of sensors and </v>
<v Speaker 3>more sophistication of the,</v>

164
00:10:22.681 --> 00:10:27.681
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>of the computer algorithms that are </v>

165
00:10:27.681 --> 00:10:29.190
<v Speaker 3>basically interrogating those sensor,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the sensor inputs.</v>

166
00:10:31.180 --> 00:10:36.180
<v Speaker 3>I'm perhaps a little bit as well of a </v>
<v Speaker 3>movement in this sort of trajectory from</v>

167
00:10:36.960 --> 00:10:41.550
<v Speaker 3>physically very unified objects always </v>
<v Speaker 3>sort of wrestle slightly whether this is</v>

168
00:10:41.551 --> 00:10:46.551
<v Speaker 3>the word I want,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's a sort of self contained </v>

169
00:10:46.551 --> 00:10:46.551
<v Speaker 3>entity.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The landmine.</v>

170
00:10:46.551 --> 00:10:50.130
<v Speaker 3>Whereas as we move in this direction,</v>
<v Speaker 3>maybe we see more dispersal of functions</v>

171
00:10:50.131 --> 00:10:51.750
<v Speaker 3>through different three different </v>
<v Speaker 3>systems.</v>

172
00:10:51.751 --> 00:10:56.751
<v Speaker 3>And I think that's another dynamic that </v>
<v Speaker 3>when we think about the development of </v>

173
00:10:56.751 --> 00:11:00.860
<v Speaker 3>autonomy and weapon systems,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it might not all live in one place </v>

174
00:11:00.860 --> 00:11:02.130
<v Speaker 3>physically moving around in one place.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It can be,</v>

175
00:11:02.340 --> 00:11:07.340
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>an array of different systems </v>

176
00:11:07.340 --> 00:11:07.340
<v Speaker 3>functioning in different,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in different places,</v>

177
00:11:07.830 --> 00:11:12.830
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>perhaps for people with a sort of ai </v>

178
00:11:12.830 --> 00:11:13.350
<v Speaker 3>type of mindset.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Maybe there's some sort of movement from</v>

179
00:11:13.710 --> 00:11:16.890
<v Speaker 3>more specific types of ai functioning </v>
<v Speaker 3>here,</v>

180
00:11:17.280 --> 00:11:22.280
<v Speaker 3>use of different specific ai functions </v>
<v Speaker 3>here to something more general going in </v>

181
00:11:22.280 --> 00:11:26.001
<v Speaker 3>this direction.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm wary of necessarily buying straight </v>

182
00:11:26.001 --> 00:11:26.970
<v Speaker 3>forward into that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but maybe you could see some movement in</v>

183
00:11:26.971 --> 00:11:28.410
<v Speaker 3>that sort of direction.</v>

184
00:11:29.190 --> 00:11:32.370
<v Speaker 3>So I just want to sort of put this to </v>
<v Speaker 3>one side for now,</v>

185
00:11:32.371 --> 00:11:37.371
<v Speaker 3>but we'll come back to it and think </v>
<v Speaker 3>about some systems that are existing </v>

186
00:11:37.371 --> 00:11:40.610
<v Speaker 3>here that I think sort of raise issues </v>
<v Speaker 3>for us and around which we could expand </v>

187
00:11:40.610 --> 00:11:41.070
<v Speaker 3>some,</v>
<v Speaker 3>some models.</v>

188
00:11:41.400 --> 00:11:43.380
<v Speaker 3>But I just wanted to have this in mind </v>
<v Speaker 3>when thinking about this.</v>

189
00:11:43.381 --> 00:11:48.381
<v Speaker 3>So we're not necessarily,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're definitely not for me thinking </v>

190
00:11:48.381 --> 00:11:50.820
<v Speaker 3>about a humanoid robots walking around </v>
<v Speaker 3>fighting like a soldier,</v>

191
00:11:51.080 --> 00:11:56.080
<v Speaker 3>a rather.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're thinking about developments and </v>

192
00:11:56.080 --> 00:11:59.071
<v Speaker 3>trajectories.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We can see coming out of established </v>

193
00:11:59.071 --> 00:12:02.430
<v Speaker 3>military systems now,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so I was going to talk now a bit about </v>

194
00:12:03.701 --> 00:12:08.701
<v Speaker 3>the political and the legal context.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Obviously there's a lot of complexity in</v>

195
00:12:09.641 --> 00:12:14.641
<v Speaker 3>the worlds of politics and legal </v>
<v Speaker 3>structures and I don't want to get too </v>

196
00:12:14.641 --> 00:12:18.121
<v Speaker 3>bogged down in it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I think in terms of understanding </v>

197
00:12:18.121 --> 00:12:21.330
<v Speaker 3>the basics of this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a debate on the international landscape </v>

198
00:12:21.330 --> 00:12:22.000
<v Speaker 3>have to have a bit of background in that</v>
<v Speaker 3>area.</v>

199
00:12:23.770 --> 00:12:28.770
<v Speaker 3>Essentially there's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think three main types of </v>

200
00:12:28.770 --> 00:12:30.460
<v Speaker 3>international law that we're concerned </v>
<v Speaker 3>with here and again,</v>

201
00:12:30.461 --> 00:12:33.250
<v Speaker 3>concerned with international law rather </v>
<v Speaker 3>than domestic legislation,</v>

202
00:12:33.251 --> 00:12:37.390
<v Speaker 3>which any individual state can put in </v>
<v Speaker 3>place whatever domestic legislation they</v>

203
00:12:37.391 --> 00:12:39.580
<v Speaker 3>want.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're looking at the international legal</v>

204
00:12:39.610 --> 00:12:44.610
<v Speaker 3>landscape.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Basically you have international human </v>

205
00:12:44.610 --> 00:12:47.851
<v Speaker 3>rights law which applies in pretty much </v>
<v Speaker 3>all circumstances and it involves the </v>

206
00:12:47.920 --> 00:12:49.660
<v Speaker 3>right to life and the right to dignity </v>
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>

207
00:12:49.661 --> 00:12:50.380
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>various other,</v>

208
00:12:51.150 --> 00:12:53.110
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>legal protections people.</v>

209
00:12:54.370 --> 00:12:59.370
<v Speaker 3>And then particularly prominent in this </v>
<v Speaker 3>debate if you have what's called </v>

210
00:12:59.370 --> 00:13:02.431
<v Speaker 3>international humanitarian law,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is the rules that govern behavior </v>

211
00:13:02.431 --> 00:13:07.231
<v Speaker 3>during armed conflict and provide </v>
<v Speaker 3>obligations on military is engaged in </v>

212
00:13:07.231 --> 00:13:08.590
<v Speaker 3>armed conflict for how they have to </v>
<v Speaker 3>conduct themselves.</v>

213
00:13:09.190 --> 00:13:14.190
<v Speaker 3>This isn't the legal framework that </v>
<v Speaker 3>decides whether it's okay to have a war </v>

214
00:13:14.190 --> 00:13:17.611
<v Speaker 3>or not.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is a legal framework that once you </v>

215
00:13:17.611 --> 00:13:20.550
<v Speaker 3>have in the war,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is the obligations that you've got </v>

216
00:13:20.550 --> 00:13:20.550
<v Speaker 3>to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you've got to follow.</v>

217
00:13:20.550 --> 00:13:21.940
<v Speaker 3>And it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it basically includes rules that say,</v>

218
00:13:21.990 --> 00:13:26.990
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're not allowed to directly kill </v>

219
00:13:26.990 --> 00:13:29.101
<v Speaker 3>civilians.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You've got to aim your military efforts </v>

220
00:13:29.101 --> 00:13:29.950
<v Speaker 3>at the forces of the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>of the enemy that enemy competence.</v>

221
00:13:31.210 --> 00:13:33.880
<v Speaker 3>You're not allowed to kill civilians </v>
<v Speaker 3>directly or deliberately,</v>

222
00:13:34.060 --> 00:13:39.060
<v Speaker 3>but you are allowed to kill some </v>
<v Speaker 3>civilians as long as you don't kill too </v>

223
00:13:39.060 --> 00:13:41.320
<v Speaker 3>many of them for the military advantage </v>
<v Speaker 3>that you're trying to achieve.</v>

224
00:13:41.321 --> 00:13:43.570
<v Speaker 3>So there's a sort of balancing acts like</v>
<v Speaker 3>this.</v>

225
00:13:43.571 --> 00:13:48.571
<v Speaker 3>This is called proportionality.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Nobody ever really knows where the </v>

226
00:13:48.571 --> 00:13:49.990
<v Speaker 3>balance lies,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's a,</v>

227
00:13:50.050 --> 00:13:51.550
<v Speaker 3>it's a sort of principle of the law </v>
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>

228
00:13:51.551 --> 00:13:53.890
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>while she can kill civilians,</v>

229
00:13:53.891 --> 00:13:56.680
<v Speaker 3>you mustn't kill an excessive number of </v>
<v Speaker 3>civilians.</v>

230
00:13:58.330 --> 00:14:01.000
<v Speaker 3>These are general rules.</v>
<v Speaker 3>These apply pretty much to all states,</v>

231
00:14:01.030 --> 00:14:01.680
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in,</v>

232
00:14:01.681 --> 00:14:01.980
<v Speaker 3>in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

233
00:14:02.020 --> 00:14:07.020
<v Speaker 3>conflict situations.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then you have treaties on specific </v>

234
00:14:07.020 --> 00:14:08.410
<v Speaker 3>weapon,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a specific weapon types.</v>

235
00:14:08.470 --> 00:14:13.470
<v Speaker 3>And this is really where you have </v>
<v Speaker 3>weapons that are considered to be </v>

236
00:14:13.470 --> 00:14:16.891
<v Speaker 3>particularly problematic in some way,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and it's decided a group of states </v>

237
00:14:16.891 --> 00:14:18.750
<v Speaker 3>decides to develop and put in place </v>
<v Speaker 3>agree,</v>

238
00:14:18.790 --> 00:14:19.980
<v Speaker 3>a treaty that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

239
00:14:20.230 --> 00:14:23.170
<v Speaker 3>that applies specifically to those,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to those weapons.</v>

240
00:14:24.190 --> 00:14:29.190
<v Speaker 3>I think it's important to recognize that</v>
<v Speaker 3>the illegal treaties are all developed </v>

241
00:14:31.271 --> 00:14:36.271
<v Speaker 3>and agreed by states that are agreed by </v>
<v Speaker 3>international governments talking </v>

242
00:14:36.271 --> 00:14:40.561
<v Speaker 3>together,</v>
<v Speaker 3>negotiating what they think the law </v>

243
00:14:40.561 --> 00:14:43.051
<v Speaker 3>should say.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And they generally only bind on states </v>

244
00:14:43.051 --> 00:14:44.380
<v Speaker 3>if they choose to adopt that legal </v>
<v Speaker 3>instrument.</v>

245
00:14:44.381 --> 00:14:45.850
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

246
00:14:46.420 --> 00:14:51.420
<v Speaker 3>I guess what I'm emphasizing there is a </v>
<v Speaker 3>sense that these are sort of social </v>

247
00:14:51.420 --> 00:14:52.970
<v Speaker 3>products in a way that political </v>
<v Speaker 3>products,</v>

248
00:14:53.330 --> 00:14:56.210
<v Speaker 3>it isn't the sort of magical law that's </v>
<v Speaker 3>come down from on high,</v>

249
00:14:56.211 --> 00:15:00.140
<v Speaker 3>perfectly written to match the needs of </v>
<v Speaker 3>humanity.</v>

250
00:15:00.380 --> 00:15:05.380
<v Speaker 3>It's a negotiated outcome developed by a</v>
<v Speaker 3>complicated set of actors who may or may</v>

251
00:15:06.411 --> 00:15:08.270
<v Speaker 3>not agree with each other and all sorts </v>
<v Speaker 3>of things.</v>

252
00:15:09.020 --> 00:15:14.020
<v Speaker 3>And what I means is there's quite a lot </v>
<v Speaker 3>of wiggle room in these legal </v>

253
00:15:14.020 --> 00:15:16.661
<v Speaker 3>frameworks.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And quite a lot of uncertainty within </v>

254
00:15:16.661 --> 00:15:19.260
<v Speaker 3>the lawyers of international </v>
<v Speaker 3>humanitarian law will tell you that's </v>

255
00:15:19.260 --> 00:15:19.260
<v Speaker 3>not true.</v>

256
00:15:19.260 --> 00:15:23.320
<v Speaker 3>But that's because there are </v>
<v Speaker 3>particularly keen on that legal </v>

257
00:15:23.320 --> 00:15:23.690
<v Speaker 3>framework,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but in reality there's a lot of,</v>

258
00:15:23.691 --> 00:15:25.330
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a lot of fuzziness to,</v>

259
00:15:25.360 --> 00:15:28.240
<v Speaker 3>to what some of the legal provisions or </v>
<v Speaker 3>some of the legal provisions say.</v>

260
00:15:29.180 --> 00:15:33.110
<v Speaker 3>And it also means that the extent to </v>
<v Speaker 3>which this law binds on people and bears</v>

261
00:15:33.111 --> 00:15:36.320
<v Speaker 3>on people is also require some social </v>
<v Speaker 3>enactment.</v>

262
00:15:36.620 --> 00:15:40.790
<v Speaker 3>There's not a sort of world police who,</v>
<v Speaker 3>who could follow up on all of these,</v>

263
00:15:40.791 --> 00:15:42.380
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>these legal frameworks.</v>

264
00:15:42.620 --> 00:15:47.620
<v Speaker 3>It requires a sort of social function </v>
<v Speaker 3>from states and from other actors to </v>

265
00:15:47.620 --> 00:15:50.690
<v Speaker 3>keep articulating a sense of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>importance of these legal rules and keep</v>

266
00:15:50.691 --> 00:15:52.390
<v Speaker 3>trying to put pressure on other factors </v>
<v Speaker 3>to,</v>

267
00:15:52.610 --> 00:15:57.440
<v Speaker 3>to a chord with them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So the issue of autonomous weapons is in</v>

268
00:15:57.441 --> 00:16:02.441
<v Speaker 3>discussion at the United Nations under a</v>
<v Speaker 3>framework called the UN Convention on </v>

269
00:16:02.441 --> 00:16:04.790
<v Speaker 3>conventional weapons.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And this is a body that has the capacity</v>

270
00:16:04.791 --> 00:16:09.791
<v Speaker 3>to agree new protocols,</v>
<v Speaker 3>new treaties essentially on specific </v>

271
00:16:09.791 --> 00:16:10.460
<v Speaker 3>weapon systems.</v>

272
00:16:10.940 --> 00:16:13.880
<v Speaker 3>And that means that diplomats from lots </v>
<v Speaker 3>of countries,</v>

273
00:16:13.881 --> 00:16:16.220
<v Speaker 3>diplomats from the US,</v>
<v Speaker 3>from the UK,</v>

274
00:16:16.430 --> 00:16:20.120
<v Speaker 3>from Russia,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and Brazil and China and other countries</v>

275
00:16:20.121 --> 00:16:23.270
<v Speaker 3>of the world will be sitting around in a</v>
<v Speaker 3>conference room,</v>

276
00:16:23.730 --> 00:16:28.730
<v Speaker 3>put it forward that perspectives on this</v>
<v Speaker 3>issue and trying to find common ground </v>

277
00:16:28.730 --> 00:16:33.220
<v Speaker 3>or trying not to find common ground,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just depending on what sort of outcome </v>

278
00:16:33.220 --> 00:16:33.650
<v Speaker 3>that they're working towards.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

279
00:16:34.180 --> 00:16:39.180
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the UN isn't a completely separate </v>

280
00:16:39.180 --> 00:16:39.830
<v Speaker 3>entity of its own.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's just the community of states in the</v>

281
00:16:39.831 --> 00:16:43.160
<v Speaker 3>world sitting together talking about </v>
<v Speaker 3>talking about things.</v>

282
00:16:44.540 --> 00:16:49.540
<v Speaker 3>So main focus of concern and those </v>
<v Speaker 3>discussions when it comes to autonomy is</v>

283
00:16:50.150 --> 00:16:52.850
<v Speaker 3>not some sort of generalized,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

284
00:16:53.360 --> 00:16:56.780
<v Speaker 3>autonomy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>autonomy of all of its forms that may be</v>

285
00:16:56.781 --> 00:16:59.030
<v Speaker 3>pertinent in the military space.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>

286
00:16:59.060 --> 00:17:03.200
<v Speaker 3>it's rather much more these,</v>
<v Speaker 3>these questions of how the targets of an</v>

287
00:17:03.201 --> 00:17:04.700
<v Speaker 3>attack,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a selected,</v>

288
00:17:05.090 --> 00:17:06.410
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>identified,</v>

289
00:17:06.470 --> 00:17:11.470
<v Speaker 3>decided upon.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And how is the decision to apply force </v>

290
00:17:11.470 --> 00:17:12.420
<v Speaker 3>to those targets made.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it's really a,</v>

291
00:17:12.440 --> 00:17:17.440
<v Speaker 3>these sort of the critical functions of </v>
<v Speaker 3>weapons systems where the movement </v>

292
00:17:17.440 --> 00:17:20.810
<v Speaker 3>towards greater autonomy is considered a</v>
<v Speaker 3>source of anxiety,</v>

293
00:17:20.811 --> 00:17:25.520
<v Speaker 3>essentially that we may see machines </v>
<v Speaker 3>making decisions on what is a target for</v>

294
00:17:25.521 --> 00:17:30.260
<v Speaker 3>an attack and choosing when and where </v>
<v Speaker 3>forces apply to that specific.</v>

295
00:17:30.360 --> 00:17:31.520
<v Speaker 3>So that specific target.</v>

296
00:17:34.760 --> 00:17:39.760
<v Speaker 3>So obviously in this context,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not everybody is like minded on this.</v>

297
00:17:40.851 --> 00:17:45.851
<v Speaker 3>There are potential advantages to </v>
<v Speaker 3>increasing autonomy in weapons systems </v>

298
00:17:45.851 --> 00:17:48.750
<v Speaker 3>and there's potential disadvantages and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>

299
00:17:48.900 --> 00:17:50.480
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>problems associated with it.</v>

300
00:17:50.490 --> 00:17:52.710
<v Speaker 3>Then within the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>within this,</v>

301
00:17:52.711 --> 00:17:54.090
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>international discussion,</v>

302
00:17:54.360 --> 00:17:57.240
<v Speaker 3>we say different perspectives laid out </v>
<v Speaker 3>on some states.</v>

303
00:17:57.241 --> 00:18:00.540
<v Speaker 3>Of course we'll be able to see some,</v>
<v Speaker 3>some advantages and some disadvantages.</v>

304
00:18:00.541 --> 00:18:05.541
<v Speaker 3>It's not a black and white sort of a </v>
<v Speaker 3>discussion in terms of the possible </v>

305
00:18:05.671 --> 00:18:10.290
<v Speaker 3>advantages for autonomy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean one of the key ones ultimately is</v>

306
00:18:10.291 --> 00:18:15.291
<v Speaker 3>framed in terms of military advantage </v>
<v Speaker 3>that we want to have more autonomy and </v>

307
00:18:15.291 --> 00:18:19.521
<v Speaker 3>weapons systems because it will maintain</v>
<v Speaker 3>or give us military advantage over </v>

308
00:18:19.521 --> 00:18:24.170
<v Speaker 3>possible adversaries.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because in the end military stuff is </v>

309
00:18:24.170 --> 00:18:24.170
<v Speaker 3>about winning wars,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

310
00:18:24.170 --> 00:18:28.821
<v Speaker 3>So you want to maintain military </v>
<v Speaker 3>advantage and military advantage number </v>

311
00:18:29.881 --> 00:18:33.360
<v Speaker 3>of factors really within that speed is </v>
<v Speaker 3>one of them.</v>

312
00:18:33.370 --> 00:18:38.370
<v Speaker 3>Speed of decision making can computerize</v>
<v Speaker 3>autonomous systems make decisions about </v>

313
00:18:38.971 --> 00:18:42.840
<v Speaker 3>where to apply force faster than a human</v>
<v Speaker 3>would be capable of doing.</v>

314
00:18:42.910 --> 00:18:46.850
<v Speaker 3>And therefore this is a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is advantageous for us.</v>

315
00:18:47.390 --> 00:18:48.680
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>also,</v>

316
00:18:48.700 --> 00:18:50.970
<v Speaker 3>speed allows for coordination of </v>
<v Speaker 3>numbers.</v>

317
00:18:50.971 --> 00:18:55.260
<v Speaker 3>So if you want to have swarms of a </v>
<v Speaker 3>systems,</v>

318
00:18:55.670 --> 00:19:00.670
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>swarms of small drones or some such a </v>

319
00:19:00.670 --> 00:19:04.700
<v Speaker 3>unique,</v>
<v Speaker 3>quite a lot of probably autonomy in </v>

320
00:19:04.700 --> 00:19:04.830
<v Speaker 3>decision making and communication </v>
<v Speaker 3>between those systems because again,</v>

321
00:19:04.831 --> 00:19:07.310
<v Speaker 3>the level of complexity and the speed </v>
<v Speaker 3>involved is,</v>

322
00:19:07.600 --> 00:19:11.580
<v Speaker 3>is greater than a human would be able to</v>
<v Speaker 3>sort of manually a engineer.</v>

323
00:19:11.581 --> 00:19:16.581
<v Speaker 3>So speed,</v>
<v Speaker 3>both in terms of responding to external </v>

324
00:19:16.581 --> 00:19:17.460
<v Speaker 3>effects,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but also coordinating your own forces,</v>

325
00:19:18.720 --> 00:19:20.140
<v Speaker 3>reach,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

326
00:19:20.730 --> 00:19:25.730
<v Speaker 3>potential for autonomous systems to be </v>
<v Speaker 3>able to operate in a communication </v>

327
00:19:25.730 --> 00:19:28.410
<v Speaker 3>denied environments where if you're </v>
<v Speaker 3>relying on a,</v>

328
00:19:28.411 --> 00:19:31.920
<v Speaker 3>on an electronic communications link to </v>
<v Speaker 3>say a current arm drone,</v>

329
00:19:32.220 --> 00:19:37.220
<v Speaker 3>maybe in a future battle space where the</v>
<v Speaker 3>enemy is denying communications in some </v>

330
00:19:37.220 --> 00:19:41.571
<v Speaker 3>way,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you could use an autonomous system to </v>

331
00:19:41.571 --> 00:19:44.361
<v Speaker 3>still fulfill a mission without a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>without needing to rely on that </v>

332
00:19:44.361 --> 00:19:47.610
<v Speaker 3>communications infrastructure,</v>
<v Speaker 3>general force multiplication.</v>

333
00:19:47.610 --> 00:19:52.610
<v Speaker 3>There's a bit of a sense that there's </v>
<v Speaker 3>going to be more and more teaming of </v>

334
00:19:52.610 --> 00:19:52.610
<v Speaker 3>machines with,</v>
<v Speaker 3>with humans,</v>

335
00:19:52.610 --> 00:19:54.900
<v Speaker 3>so machines operating alongside humans </v>
<v Speaker 3>in the battle space.</v>

336
00:19:56.850 --> 00:20:01.850
<v Speaker 3>And then this importantly as it presents</v>
<v Speaker 3>it at least a sense that these are </v>

337
00:20:01.850 --> 00:20:03.780
<v Speaker 3>systems which could allow you to reduce </v>
<v Speaker 3>the risk to your own forces.</v>

338
00:20:03.781 --> 00:20:08.781
<v Speaker 3>That maybe if we can put some sort of </v>
<v Speaker 3>autonomous robotic system at work in a </v>

339
00:20:08.781 --> 00:20:11.100
<v Speaker 3>specific environment,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then we don't need to put one of our own</v>

340
00:20:11.101 --> 00:20:13.470
<v Speaker 3>soldiers in that position.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And as a result,</v>

341
00:20:13.471 --> 00:20:15.660
<v Speaker 3>we're less likely to have casualties </v>
<v Speaker 3>coming home.</v>

342
00:20:15.661 --> 00:20:20.661
<v Speaker 3>Which of course politically is a </v>
<v Speaker 3>problematic for maintaining any sort of </v>

343
00:20:20.661 --> 00:20:24.210
<v Speaker 3>conflict,</v>
<v Speaker 3>posture set against all that stuff.</v>

344
00:20:24.240 --> 00:20:29.240
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's a sense that I think most </v>

345
00:20:29.240 --> 00:20:31.680
<v Speaker 3>fundamentally this perhaps a moral </v>
<v Speaker 3>hazard that we come across at some point</v>

346
00:20:31.820 --> 00:20:36.820
<v Speaker 3>that the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>some sort of a boundary where seeing or </v>

347
00:20:38.131 --> 00:20:43.131
<v Speaker 3>conceptualizing a situation where </v>
<v Speaker 3>machines are deciding who to kill in a </v>

348
00:20:43.231 --> 00:20:47.710
<v Speaker 3>certain context is just somehow wrong </v>
<v Speaker 3>and well,</v>

349
00:20:47.740 --> 00:20:50.260
<v Speaker 3>that's not a very easy argument to just </v>
<v Speaker 3>start,</v>

350
00:20:50.320 --> 00:20:55.320
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>articulate in a sort of rationalized </v>

351
00:20:55.320 --> 00:20:56.560
<v Speaker 3>sense,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but there's some sort of moral revulsion</v>

352
00:20:56.620 --> 00:21:01.150
<v Speaker 3>that perhaps it comes about at this </v>
<v Speaker 3>sense that machines are now deciding who</v>

353
00:21:01.151 --> 00:21:03.880
<v Speaker 3>should be killed in a particular,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in a particular environment.</v>

354
00:21:04.740 --> 00:21:07.480
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's a set of legal concerns.</v>

355
00:21:08.380 --> 00:21:13.380
<v Speaker 3>Can these systems be used in accordance </v>
<v Speaker 3>with the existing legal obligations?</v>

356
00:21:14.270 --> 00:21:19.270
<v Speaker 3>And I'm going to come on a little bit </v>
<v Speaker 3>later to our orientation in the legal </v>

357
00:21:19.270 --> 00:21:19.270
<v Speaker 3>side,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is,</v>

358
00:21:19.270 --> 00:21:23.740
<v Speaker 3>is also about how they may stretch the </v>
<v Speaker 3>fabric of the law and the structure of </v>

359
00:21:23.740 --> 00:21:23.770
<v Speaker 3>the law.</v>
<v Speaker 3>As we say it.</v>

360
00:21:24.550 --> 00:21:28.540
<v Speaker 3>The some concerns in this sort of legal </v>
<v Speaker 3>arguments for me that,</v>

361
00:21:28.541 --> 00:21:33.541
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we sometimes slip into a language of </v>

362
00:21:33.541 --> 00:21:35.170
<v Speaker 3>talking about machines making legal </v>
<v Speaker 3>decisions.</v>

363
00:21:35.410 --> 00:21:39.700
<v Speaker 3>Will a machine be able to apply the rule</v>
<v Speaker 3>of proportionality properly?</v>

364
00:21:40.750 --> 00:21:43.030
<v Speaker 3>There's dangers in that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know what it means,</v>

365
00:21:43.420 --> 00:21:46.870
<v Speaker 3>but at the same time the law is </v>
<v Speaker 3>addressed to humans.</v>

366
00:21:46.871 --> 00:21:51.871
<v Speaker 3>The law isn't addressed to machines.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it's humans who have the obligation </v>

367
00:21:51.871 --> 00:21:51.871
<v Speaker 3>to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

368
00:21:52.000 --> 00:21:57.000
<v Speaker 3>an act,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the legal obligation and machine may do </v>

369
00:21:57.000 --> 00:21:58.120
<v Speaker 3>a function that is sort of analogous to </v>
<v Speaker 3>that legal decision.</v>

370
00:21:58.480 --> 00:22:03.480
<v Speaker 3>But ultimately to my mind is still a </v>
<v Speaker 3>human who has to be making the legal </v>

371
00:22:03.480 --> 00:22:06.430
<v Speaker 3>determination based on some predict </v>
<v Speaker 3>prediction of what that machine will do.</v>

372
00:22:06.660 --> 00:22:08.830
<v Speaker 3>And I think this is a very dangerous </v>
<v Speaker 3>slippage because even,</v>

373
00:22:09.270 --> 00:22:14.270
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>senior legal academics can slip into </v>

374
00:22:14.270 --> 00:22:17.881
<v Speaker 3>this mindset which is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is a little bit like handing over </v>

375
00:22:17.881 --> 00:22:21.600
<v Speaker 3>the legal framework to machines before </v>
<v Speaker 3>you've even got onto arguing about what </v>

376
00:22:21.600 --> 00:22:23.770
<v Speaker 3>we should or shouldn't have.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So we need to be careful in that area.</v>

377
00:22:23.771 --> 00:22:28.771
<v Speaker 3>And it's a little bit to do with,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for me continuing to treat these </v>

378
00:22:28.771 --> 00:22:31.120
<v Speaker 3>technologies as machines rather than </v>
<v Speaker 3>into treating them as agents in some way</v>

379
00:22:31.121 --> 00:22:35.710
<v Speaker 3>of sort of equal or equivalent or </v>
<v Speaker 3>similar moral standing to,</v>

380
00:22:36.040 --> 00:22:41.040
<v Speaker 3>to humans.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then we have a whole set of wider </v>

381
00:22:41.040 --> 00:22:42.190
<v Speaker 3>concerns that are raised.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So we've got moral anxieties,</v>

382
00:22:42.250 --> 00:22:47.250
<v Speaker 3>a legal concerns,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and then a set of other concerns around </v>

383
00:22:47.250 --> 00:22:47.620
<v Speaker 3>risks,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

384
00:22:47.621 --> 00:22:52.621
<v Speaker 3>that could be unpredictable risks,</v>
<v Speaker 3>does the sort of normal accidents </v>

385
00:22:52.621 --> 00:22:52.621
<v Speaker 3>theory.</v>

386
00:22:52.621 --> 00:22:56.760
<v Speaker 3>Maybe you've come across that stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's a bit of that sort of language </v>

387
00:22:56.760 --> 00:22:58.330
<v Speaker 3>in the debate about complicated systems </v>
<v Speaker 3>and not been able to,</v>

388
00:22:58.630 --> 00:22:59.330
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

389
00:22:59.380 --> 00:23:04.380
<v Speaker 3>not be able to avoid accidents and in </v>
<v Speaker 3>some respects some anxieties about maybe</v>

390
00:23:05.591 --> 00:23:09.430
<v Speaker 3>this will reduce the barriers to </v>
<v Speaker 3>engaging in military action,</v>

391
00:23:09.431 --> 00:23:11.830
<v Speaker 3>may be being able to use autonomous </v>
<v Speaker 3>weapons,</v>

392
00:23:11.831 --> 00:23:16.831
<v Speaker 3>will make it easier to go to war.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And some anxieties about sort of </v>

393
00:23:16.831 --> 00:23:19.960
<v Speaker 3>international security and balance of </v>
<v Speaker 3>power and arms races and the like.</v>

394
00:23:21.460 --> 00:23:26.460
<v Speaker 3>These are all significant concerns.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't tend to think much in this area,</v>

395
00:23:26.890 --> 00:23:30.400
<v Speaker 3>partly because they involve quite a lot </v>
<v Speaker 3>of speculation about what may or may not</v>

396
00:23:30.401 --> 00:23:33.190
<v Speaker 3>be in the future and they're quite </v>
<v Speaker 3>difficult to populate with,</v>

397
00:23:33.191 --> 00:23:38.191
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>with sort of more grounded arguments I </v>

398
00:23:38.191 --> 00:23:38.191
<v Speaker 3>find.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But uh,</v>

399
00:23:38.191 --> 00:23:39.460
<v Speaker 3>that doesn't mean that they are </v>
<v Speaker 3>significant in themselves,</v>

400
00:23:39.461 --> 00:23:41.980
<v Speaker 3>but I find them less straightforward as </v>
<v Speaker 3>an entry point.</v>

401
00:23:43.870 --> 00:23:48.440
<v Speaker 3>So been all of these different issues.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's multiple unstable terminology,</v>

402
00:23:48.441 --> 00:23:50.330
<v Speaker 3>lots of arguments coming in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>different directions.</v>

403
00:23:50.630 --> 00:23:55.630
<v Speaker 3>And our job as an NGO in a way is we're </v>
<v Speaker 3>trying to find ways of building a </v>

404
00:23:55.630 --> 00:23:59.540
<v Speaker 3>constructive conversation in this </v>
<v Speaker 3>environment which can move toward states</v>

405
00:23:59.541 --> 00:24:04.130
<v Speaker 3>adopting a more constraining orientation</v>
<v Speaker 3>to this movement towards autonomy.</v>

406
00:24:05.810 --> 00:24:10.810
<v Speaker 3>And the main tool we've used to work </v>
<v Speaker 3>towards that so far has been to perhaps </v>

407
00:24:13.491 --> 00:24:18.491
<v Speaker 3>stop focusing on the technology per se </v>
<v Speaker 3>and the idea of what is autonomy and how</v>

408
00:24:18.711 --> 00:24:23.711
<v Speaker 3>much autonomy is a problem.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And to bring the focus back a bit onto </v>

409
00:24:23.711 --> 00:24:25.490
<v Speaker 3>what is the human element that we want </v>
<v Speaker 3>to preserve in all of this.</v>

410
00:24:25.790 --> 00:24:30.790
<v Speaker 3>Because it seems like most of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>anxieties that come from a sense of a </v>

411
00:24:30.790 --> 00:24:35.741
<v Speaker 3>problem with autonomous weapons are </v>
<v Speaker 3>about some sort of absence of a human </v>

412
00:24:35.741 --> 00:24:40.181
<v Speaker 3>element that we want to preserve,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but unless we can in some way define </v>

413
00:24:40.181 --> 00:24:41.030
<v Speaker 3>what this human element is that we want </v>
<v Speaker 3>to preserve,</v>

414
00:24:41.300 --> 00:24:44.090
<v Speaker 3>I'm not sure we can expect to define its</v>
<v Speaker 3>absence.</v>

415
00:24:44.090 --> 00:24:49.090
<v Speaker 3>Very straightforward.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I kind of feel like we want to pull </v>

416
00:24:49.090 --> 00:24:49.640
<v Speaker 3>the discussion onto a focus on the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>on the human,</v>

417
00:24:49.660 --> 00:24:50.990
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>on the human element.</v>

418
00:24:51.540 --> 00:24:56.540
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and the tool we've used for this so far </v>

419
00:24:56.540 --> 00:24:59.000
<v Speaker 3>has been basically a terminology about </v>
<v Speaker 3>the need for meaningful human control.</v>

420
00:24:59.270 --> 00:25:04.010
<v Speaker 3>And this is just a form of words that </v>
<v Speaker 3>we've sort of introduced into the debate</v>

421
00:25:04.310 --> 00:25:09.310
<v Speaker 3>and we've promoted it in discussions </v>
<v Speaker 3>with diplomats and with different </v>

422
00:25:09.310 --> 00:25:12.731
<v Speaker 3>actors.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And we've built up the idea of this </v>

423
00:25:12.731 --> 00:25:12.731
<v Speaker 3>terminology as,</v>
<v Speaker 3>as being a sort of tool.</v>

424
00:25:12.740 --> 00:25:14.230
<v Speaker 3>It's a bit like a meme,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

425
00:25:14.231 --> 00:25:15.660
<v Speaker 3>You,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you create the,</v>

426
00:25:15.690 --> 00:25:19.580
<v Speaker 3>the terms and then you use that to sort </v>
<v Speaker 3>of structure the discussion in a,</v>

427
00:25:19.810 --> 00:25:21.890
<v Speaker 3>in a productive,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in a productive way.</v>

428
00:25:22.700 --> 00:25:26.150
<v Speaker 3>One of the reasons I like it is it works</v>
<v Speaker 3>partly because the word meaningful,</v>

429
00:25:26.151 --> 00:25:31.151
<v Speaker 3>it doesn't mean anything particular or </v>
<v Speaker 3>at least it means whatever you might </v>

430
00:25:31.151 --> 00:25:32.450
<v Speaker 3>want it to mean.</v>

431
00:25:32.720 --> 00:25:33.590
<v Speaker 3>And I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I find that,</v>

432
00:25:33.591 --> 00:25:34.180
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

433
00:25:34.260 --> 00:25:36.850
<v Speaker 3>an enjoyable sort of tension and in </v>
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>

434
00:25:36.860 --> 00:25:40.790
<v Speaker 3>but the term meaningful human control </v>
<v Speaker 3>has been quite well picked up in and the</v>

435
00:25:40.791 --> 00:25:44.720
<v Speaker 3>literature on this issue and in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>diplomatic discourse and it's helping to</v>

436
00:25:44.721 --> 00:25:46.880
<v Speaker 3>structure us towards a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

437
00:25:46.970 --> 00:25:51.970
<v Speaker 3>what we think are the key questions,</v>
<v Speaker 3>basic arguments for the idea of </v>

438
00:25:52.821 --> 00:25:54.590
<v Speaker 3>meaningful human control from my </v>
<v Speaker 3>perspective,</v>

439
00:25:54.860 --> 00:25:59.860
<v Speaker 3>a quite simple and intended to use </v>
<v Speaker 3>basically a sort of absurdist sort of </v>

440
00:26:01.100 --> 00:26:05.240
<v Speaker 3>logic if there is such a thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>First of all,</v>

441
00:26:05.241 --> 00:26:10.241
<v Speaker 3>really to recognize that no governments </v>
<v Speaker 3>are in favor of an autonomous weapon </v>

442
00:26:10.491 --> 00:26:13.520
<v Speaker 3>system that has no human control </v>
<v Speaker 3>whatsoever,</v>

443
00:26:13.521 --> 00:26:18.521
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Nobody is arguing that it would be a </v>

444
00:26:18.521 --> 00:26:20.810
<v Speaker 3>good idea for us to have some sort of </v>
<v Speaker 3>autonomous weapon that just flies around</v>

445
00:26:20.811 --> 00:26:25.370
<v Speaker 3>the world deciding to kill people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We don't know who it's gonna count a why</v>

446
00:26:25.700 --> 00:26:27.800
<v Speaker 3>it doesn't have to report back to us,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you know,</v>

447
00:26:28.220 --> 00:26:29.900
<v Speaker 3>we're in favor.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Nobody's in favor of this,</v>

448
00:26:29.901 --> 00:26:31.850
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is obviously ridiculous,</v>

449
00:26:31.851 --> 00:26:36.851
<v Speaker 3>so there needs to be some form of human </v>
<v Speaker 3>control because we can rule out that </v>

450
00:26:37.220 --> 00:26:42.110
<v Speaker 3>sort of ridiculous extension of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>argument and on the other hand,</v>

451
00:26:42.890 --> 00:26:47.890
<v Speaker 3>if you just have a person in a dark room</v>
<v Speaker 3>with a red light that comes on every now</v>

452
00:26:48.251 --> 00:26:50.650
<v Speaker 3>and again and they don't know anything </v>
<v Speaker 3>else about what's going on,</v>

453
00:26:51.040 --> 00:26:56.040
<v Speaker 3>but that the human who's controlling </v>
<v Speaker 3>this autonomous weapon and when the red </v>

454
00:26:56.040 --> 00:26:59.581
<v Speaker 3>light comes on,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they pushed the fire button to launch a </v>

455
00:26:59.581 --> 00:26:59.581
<v Speaker 3>rocket or something.</v>

456
00:26:59.630 --> 00:27:02.720
<v Speaker 3>We know that that isn't sufficient tumor</v>
<v Speaker 3>control either,</v>

457
00:27:02.721 --> 00:27:04.350
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's a person doing something,</v>

458
00:27:04.351 --> 00:27:09.351
<v Speaker 3>there's a person engaged in the process,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but clearly it's just some sort of </v>

459
00:27:09.351 --> 00:27:11.540
<v Speaker 3>mechanistic,</v>
<v Speaker 3>pro forma human engagement.</v>

460
00:27:11.541 --> 00:27:15.740
<v Speaker 3>So between these two kinds of ridiculous</v>
<v Speaker 3>extremes,</v>

461
00:27:15.800 --> 00:27:20.130
<v Speaker 3>I think we get the idea that there's.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's some sort of fuzzy,</v>

462
00:27:20.220 --> 00:27:23.160
<v Speaker 3>fuzzy line that that must exist in </v>
<v Speaker 3>there,</v>

463
00:27:23.460 --> 00:27:27.230
<v Speaker 3>in there somewhere and that everybody </v>
<v Speaker 3>can in some way agree to the idea that's</v>

464
00:27:27.231 --> 00:27:32.231
<v Speaker 3>such a line should exist.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So the question then for us is how to </v>

465
00:27:32.231 --> 00:27:37.161
<v Speaker 3>move the conversation in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>international community towards a </v>

466
00:27:37.161 --> 00:27:40.761
<v Speaker 3>productive sort of discussion of where </v>
<v Speaker 3>the parameters of this line might be </v>

467
00:27:41.070 --> 00:27:41.880
<v Speaker 3>conceptualized.</v>

468
00:27:43.820 --> 00:27:48.820
<v Speaker 3>So that's brought us on to thinking </v>
<v Speaker 3>about a more substantive side of </v>

469
00:27:48.820 --> 00:27:52.760
<v Speaker 3>questions about what are the key </v>
<v Speaker 3>elements of meaningful human control and</v>

470
00:27:53.780 --> 00:27:56.420
<v Speaker 3>we've laid out some basic elements.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I'm like,</v>

471
00:27:56.421 --> 00:27:58.340
<v Speaker 3>get rid of that fuzzy line because it's </v>
<v Speaker 3>a bit useless anyway,</v>

472
00:27:58.341 --> 00:28:03.341
<v Speaker 3>isn't it?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then I can put my key elements on </v>

473
00:28:03.341 --> 00:28:03.341
<v Speaker 3>here.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

474
00:28:03.341 --> 00:28:06.821
<v Speaker 3>one of them is I'm predictable,</v>
<v Speaker 3>reliable,</v>

475
00:28:12.720 --> 00:28:17.720
<v Speaker 3>transparent technology.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is kind of before you get into </v>

476
00:28:24.290 --> 00:28:28.470
<v Speaker 3>exactly what the system is going to do,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we want the technology itself to be sort</v>

477
00:28:28.471 --> 00:28:31.140
<v Speaker 3>of well made and it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

478
00:28:31.500 --> 00:28:36.180
<v Speaker 3>it's going to basically do what it says </v>
<v Speaker 3>it's going to do whatever that is and we</v>

479
00:28:36.181 --> 00:28:38.370
<v Speaker 3>want to be able to understand it to some</v>
<v Speaker 3>extent.</v>

480
00:28:38.760 --> 00:28:43.760
<v Speaker 3>Obviously this becomes a bit of a </v>
<v Speaker 3>challenge and some of the Ai type </v>

481
00:28:43.760 --> 00:28:44.400
<v Speaker 3>functions where you start to have </v>
<v Speaker 3>machine learning,</v>

482
00:28:44.700 --> 00:28:46.980
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>issues and these issues of transparency.</v>

483
00:28:46.981 --> 00:28:48.480
<v Speaker 3>Perhaps they start to come up a little </v>
<v Speaker 3>bit,</v>

484
00:28:48.700 --> 00:28:53.700
<v Speaker 3>a little bit,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but these kinds of issues in the design </v>

485
00:28:53.700 --> 00:28:56.571
<v Speaker 3>and the development of of of systems.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Another thing we want to have is,</v>

486
00:28:57.580 --> 00:29:01.710
<v Speaker 3>and I think this is a key one,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is accurate information</v>

487
00:29:09.120 --> 00:29:12.900
<v Speaker 3>and it's accurate information on the </v>
<v Speaker 3>intent of the commander.</v>

488
00:29:14.800 --> 00:29:19.800
<v Speaker 3>Well the outcome,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what's the outcome we're trying to </v>

489
00:29:19.800 --> 00:29:22.551
<v Speaker 3>achieve?</v>
<v Speaker 3>How does the technology work and what's </v>

490
00:29:30.811 --> 00:29:35.811
<v Speaker 3>the context so it is already full so it </v>
<v Speaker 3>won't take long.</v>

491
00:29:41.230 --> 00:29:42.100
<v Speaker 3>Third one is</v>

492
00:29:43.000 --> 00:29:48.000
<v Speaker 4>timely intervention,</v>
<v Speaker 4>human intervention.</v>

493
00:29:50.151 --> 00:29:50.680
<v Speaker 4>It should be.</v>

494
00:29:53.200 --> 00:29:58.200
<v Speaker 3>It'd be good if we could turn it off </v>
<v Speaker 3>some points if it's going to be a very </v>

495
00:29:58.200 --> 00:29:59.950
<v Speaker 3>long acting system would be good if we </v>
<v Speaker 3>turn it off.</v>

496
00:30:00.370 --> 00:30:04.240
<v Speaker 3>Maybe that's the fourth one is just the </v>
<v Speaker 3>sort of framework of accountability.</v>

497
00:30:09.890 --> 00:30:14.890
<v Speaker 3>So we're thinking the basic elements of </v>
<v Speaker 3>humor control can be broken down into </v>

498
00:30:15.691 --> 00:30:20.691
<v Speaker 3>these areas.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Some of them have about the technology </v>

499
00:30:20.691 --> 00:30:21.170
<v Speaker 3>itself,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how it's designed and made.</v>

500
00:30:21.180 --> 00:30:26.180
<v Speaker 3>How do you verify and validate that it's</v>
<v Speaker 3>gonna do what the manufacturers have </v>

501
00:30:26.180 --> 00:30:28.170
<v Speaker 3>said it's going to do.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Can you understand it?</v>

502
00:30:29.950 --> 00:30:34.950
<v Speaker 3>This one I think is the key one in terms</v>
<v Speaker 3>of thinking about the issue and this is </v>

503
00:30:34.950 --> 00:30:35.260
<v Speaker 3>what I'm going to talk about a bit more </v>
<v Speaker 3>now.</v>

504
00:30:35.800 --> 00:30:38.800
<v Speaker 3>The accurate information on what's the </v>
<v Speaker 3>commander's intent,</v>

505
00:30:38.830 --> 00:30:41.200
<v Speaker 3>what do you want to achieve in the use </v>
<v Speaker 3>of this system?</v>

506
00:30:42.940 --> 00:30:47.940
<v Speaker 3>What effects is it going to have?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean this makes a big difference how </v>

507
00:30:47.940 --> 00:30:51.721
<v Speaker 3>it works.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This factors here involve what are the </v>

508
00:30:51.721 --> 00:30:53.270
<v Speaker 3>target profiles that it's going to use.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Whereas mine on the landmine,</v>

509
00:30:53.290 --> 00:30:57.460
<v Speaker 3>of course it was just pressure.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Pressure is being taken as a pressure on</v>

510
00:30:57.461 --> 00:31:02.461
<v Speaker 3>the ground is being taken as a proxy for</v>
<v Speaker 3>a military target for a human who we're </v>

511
00:31:02.461 --> 00:31:04.610
<v Speaker 3>going to assume as a military target,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but,</v>

512
00:31:05.410 --> 00:31:10.410
<v Speaker 3>and these systems,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're going to have different target </v>

513
00:31:10.410 --> 00:31:10.410
<v Speaker 3>profiles,</v>
<v Speaker 3>different heat shapes,</v>

514
00:31:10.410 --> 00:31:10.410
<v Speaker 3>different,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

515
00:31:10.410 --> 00:31:12.190
<v Speaker 3>different patterns of data that the </v>
<v Speaker 3>system is going to operate on.</v>

516
00:31:12.190 --> 00:31:16.770
<v Speaker 3>The basis of what sort of actual weapons</v>
<v Speaker 3>are going to use to apply force.</v>

517
00:31:16.790 --> 00:31:20.090
<v Speaker 3>It makes a difference if it's going to </v>
<v Speaker 3>just fire a bullet from a gun or if it's</v>

518
00:31:20.150 --> 00:31:23.390
<v Speaker 3>gonna drop a 2000 pound bomb.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

519
00:31:23.400 --> 00:31:28.400
<v Speaker 3>that has a different effect.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And the way in which you envision sort </v>

520
00:31:28.400 --> 00:31:31.220
<v Speaker 3>of control for those effects is going to</v>
<v Speaker 3>be different in those different cases.</v>

521
00:31:32.490 --> 00:31:33.990
<v Speaker 3>And finally,</v>
<v Speaker 3>very importantly,</v>

522
00:31:34.410 --> 00:31:39.410
<v Speaker 3>these issues of context,</v>
<v Speaker 3>information on the context in which the </v>

523
00:31:39.410 --> 00:31:40.650
<v Speaker 3>system will will operate.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

524
00:31:41.880 --> 00:31:46.880
<v Speaker 3>Contexts of course,</v>
<v Speaker 3>includes all the going to be civilians </v>

525
00:31:46.880 --> 00:31:47.250
<v Speaker 3>present in the area.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Can you assess,</v>

526
00:31:47.490 --> 00:31:52.490
<v Speaker 3>are they going to be other objects in </v>
<v Speaker 3>the area that may present a similar </v>

527
00:31:52.490 --> 00:31:53.750
<v Speaker 3>pattern to the proxy data?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

528
00:31:53.751 --> 00:31:55.870
<v Speaker 3>if you're using a heat shape of a </v>
<v Speaker 3>vehicle engine,</v>

529
00:31:56.640 --> 00:31:58.470
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it might be aimed at a tank,</v>

530
00:31:58.710 --> 00:32:02.230
<v Speaker 3>but if there's an ambulance in the same </v>
<v Speaker 3>location is an ambulance,</v>

531
00:32:02.231 --> 00:32:07.231
<v Speaker 3>is vehicle engine heat shape </v>
<v Speaker 3>sufficiently similar to the tank to </v>

532
00:32:07.470 --> 00:32:11.970
<v Speaker 3>cause some confusion between the two </v>
<v Speaker 3>sets of information like that?</v>

533
00:32:13.810 --> 00:32:15.570
<v Speaker 3>And context of course varies in </v>
<v Speaker 3>different.</v>

534
00:32:15.650 --> 00:32:20.650
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>obviously varies in different </v>

535
00:32:20.650 --> 00:32:20.650
<v Speaker 3>environments.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But I think we can see different domains</v>

536
00:32:20.650 --> 00:32:23.871
<v Speaker 3>in this area as well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is significant operating in the </v>

537
00:32:23.871 --> 00:32:27.631
<v Speaker 3>water or in the ocean.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You've probably got a less cluttered </v>

538
00:32:27.631 --> 00:32:30.481
<v Speaker 3>environment or less complex environment </v>
<v Speaker 3>than if you're operating in an urban in </v>

539
00:32:30.481 --> 00:32:33.961
<v Speaker 3>an urban area.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So that's another factor that needs to </v>

540
00:32:33.961 --> 00:32:33.970
<v Speaker 3>be taken into,</v>
<v Speaker 3>into accountant in this.</v>

541
00:32:35.400 --> 00:32:40.400
<v Speaker 3>So I just wanted to talk a little bit </v>
<v Speaker 3>about some existing perhaps and think </v>

542
00:32:41.901 --> 00:32:46.490
<v Speaker 3>about them in the context of this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>these sort of set of issues here.</v>

543
00:32:50.700 --> 00:32:55.700
<v Speaker 3>One system that you may maybe aware of </v>
<v Speaker 3>is it's on a boat.</v>

544
00:33:02.550 --> 00:33:07.400
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>okay.</v>

545
00:33:07.430 --> 00:33:10.310
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so then like the Phalanx,</v>

546
00:33:12.680 --> 00:33:14.330
<v Speaker 3>anti missile system,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's on a boats,</v>

547
00:33:14.340 --> 00:33:16.000
<v Speaker 3>but there's various anti missile </v>
<v Speaker 3>systems.</v>

548
00:33:16.001 --> 00:33:21.001
<v Speaker 3>I mean it doesn't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the details don't matter in this </v>

549
00:33:21.001 --> 00:33:23.051
<v Speaker 3>context.</v>
<v Speaker 3>These are systems that human terms that </v>

550
00:33:23.051 --> 00:33:27.091
<v Speaker 3>aren't so human is choosing when to turn</v>
<v Speaker 3>it on and a human turns it off again.</v>

551
00:33:29.540 --> 00:33:34.540
<v Speaker 3>But when it's operating it's the radar </v>
<v Speaker 3>is basically scanning and area of an </v>

552
00:33:34.540 --> 00:33:39.371
<v Speaker 3>area of sky up here.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it's looking for fast moving </v>

553
00:33:40.500 --> 00:33:45.500
<v Speaker 3>incoming objects because basically it's </v>
<v Speaker 3>designed to automatically shoot down </v>

554
00:33:45.500 --> 00:33:46.280
<v Speaker 3>incoming missiles.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Rockets,</v>

555
00:33:46.281 --> 00:33:50.540
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>So thinking about these characteristics,</v>

556
00:33:51.790 --> 00:33:56.790
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what the outcome you want is you want </v>

557
00:33:56.790 --> 00:33:58.511
<v Speaker 3>your boat not to get blown up by an </v>
<v Speaker 3>incoming missile and you want to shoot </v>

558
00:33:58.511 --> 00:34:00.820
<v Speaker 3>down any incoming missiles.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

559
00:34:00.830 --> 00:34:05.830
<v Speaker 3>how the technology works because you </v>
<v Speaker 3>know that it's basically using radar to </v>

560
00:34:05.830 --> 00:34:07.210
<v Speaker 3>see incoming fast moving,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

561
00:34:07.340 --> 00:34:12.260
<v Speaker 3>signatures and you have a pretty good </v>
<v Speaker 3>idea of the context because the sky is a</v>

562
00:34:12.261 --> 00:34:17.261
<v Speaker 3>fairly uncluttered comparatively and </v>
<v Speaker 3>you'd like to think that any fast moving</v>

563
00:34:19.011 --> 00:34:24.011
<v Speaker 3>incoming objects towards your hair are </v>
<v Speaker 3>probably going to be a incoming </v>

564
00:34:24.011 --> 00:34:25.970
<v Speaker 3>missiles,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not guaranteed to be the case.</v>

565
00:34:26.030 --> 00:34:27.490
<v Speaker 3>One of these systems shut down,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

566
00:34:27.590 --> 00:34:29.570
<v Speaker 3>an Iranian passenger airliner,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but,</v>

567
00:34:29.571 --> 00:34:30.740
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>by accident,</v>

568
00:34:30.800 --> 00:34:32.600
<v Speaker 3>which is obviously a significant </v>
<v Speaker 3>accident,</v>

569
00:34:33.010 --> 00:34:37.160
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but basically you have a sentence of,</v>

570
00:34:37.220 --> 00:34:39.680
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the fact that the data that you're using</v>

571
00:34:39.681 --> 00:34:41.720
<v Speaker 3>tracks pretty well to the target </v>
<v Speaker 3>objects,</v>

572
00:34:42.020 --> 00:34:47.020
<v Speaker 3>if not absolutely precisely.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You Bet are relatively controllable </v>

573
00:34:47.020 --> 00:34:49.970
<v Speaker 3>environments in terms of the sky and </v>
<v Speaker 3>you've got a human being.</v>

574
00:34:50.420 --> 00:34:52.010
<v Speaker 3>The system isn't really mobile.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

575
00:34:52.011 --> 00:34:54.680
<v Speaker 3>it's kind of mobile insofar as the boat </v>
<v Speaker 3>can move around,</v>

576
00:34:54.681 --> 00:34:57.260
<v Speaker 3>but the person who's operating it as you</v>
<v Speaker 3>know,</v>

577
00:34:58.590 --> 00:35:00.380
<v Speaker 3>the mobile in the same place.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

578
00:35:00.381 --> 00:35:02.660
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so it's relatively static.</v>

579
00:35:04.370 --> 00:35:09.370
<v Speaker 3>So I think looking at that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you could suggest that there's still a </v>

580
00:35:09.370 --> 00:35:13.721
<v Speaker 3>reasonable amount of human control over </v>
<v Speaker 3>this system because when we look at it </v>

581
00:35:13.721 --> 00:35:14.750
<v Speaker 3>in terms of a number of the functions </v>
<v Speaker 3>here,</v>

582
00:35:14.990 --> 00:35:16.490
<v Speaker 3>we can understand how that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

583
00:35:17.270 --> 00:35:22.270
<v Speaker 3>how that system is being managed in a </v>
<v Speaker 3>human controls by and although there's </v>

584
00:35:22.270 --> 00:35:25.691
<v Speaker 3>still a degree of autonomy or at least </v>
<v Speaker 3>it's sort of highly automated and the </v>

585
00:35:25.691 --> 00:35:29.681
<v Speaker 3>way that it actually identifies the </v>
<v Speaker 3>targets and moves the gun and shoots </v>

586
00:35:29.681 --> 00:35:31.430
<v Speaker 3>down the incoming object.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The basic framework is volume,</v>

587
00:35:31.431 --> 00:35:33.380
<v Speaker 3>which I fail like it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

588
00:35:33.381 --> 00:35:38.381
<v Speaker 3>it's not for me to say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I feel like I'm still a reasonable </v>

589
00:35:38.381 --> 00:35:38.700
<v Speaker 3>amount of human controlled is bang,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Bang,</v>

590
00:35:38.710 --> 00:35:41.130
<v Speaker 3>applaud.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

591
00:35:41.131 --> 00:35:46.131
<v Speaker 3>Another sort of system.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm gonna draw some tanks or something </v>

592
00:35:46.131 --> 00:35:49.240
<v Speaker 3>now say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

593
00:35:49.830 --> 00:35:54.120
<v Speaker 3>well I'm just going to draw them out a </v>
<v Speaker 3>lot because otherwise it's too long.</v>

594
00:35:57.380 --> 00:36:02.310
<v Speaker 3>Days of tanks all but fighting vehicles.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Ignore the graphic design skills.</v>

595
00:36:02.620 --> 00:36:06.150
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there a sense of use weapons systems,</v>

596
00:36:06.480 --> 00:36:09.660
<v Speaker 3>Blah commander,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a significant distance,</v>

597
00:36:09.720 --> 00:36:14.720
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Can't necessarily see the location of </v>

598
00:36:14.720 --> 00:36:14.720
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>of the tanks,</v>

599
00:36:14.720 --> 00:36:17.580
<v Speaker 3>but they know that the cement tanks in </v>
<v Speaker 3>this area over here,</v>

600
00:36:17.750 --> 00:36:22.750
<v Speaker 3>right,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and maybe they have some sense of what </v>

601
00:36:22.861 --> 00:36:24.870
<v Speaker 3>this area is that aren't in the middle </v>
<v Speaker 3>of a town.</v>

602
00:36:25.170 --> 00:36:27.840
<v Speaker 3>They're out in the open so they have an </v>
<v Speaker 3>understanding of the context,</v>

603
00:36:27.841 --> 00:36:29.760
<v Speaker 3>but maybe not a detailed understanding </v>
<v Speaker 3>of the context.</v>

604
00:36:30.720 --> 00:36:35.720
<v Speaker 3>So the weapons system is going to file </v>
<v Speaker 3>multiple warheads into this target area.</v>

605
00:36:36.480 --> 00:36:39.930
<v Speaker 3>The commander is decided upon the target</v>
<v Speaker 3>of the attack,</v>

606
00:36:40.410 --> 00:36:45.410
<v Speaker 3>this group of tanks here,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but as the war heads approached the </v>

607
00:36:45.410 --> 00:36:49.730
<v Speaker 3>target area,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the warheads are going to communicate </v>

608
00:36:49.730 --> 00:36:51.501
<v Speaker 3>amongst themselves and that kind of </v>
<v Speaker 3>allocate it themselves to the specific </v>

609
00:36:52.050 --> 00:36:57.050
<v Speaker 3>to the specific objects.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I got to detect the heat shape of </v>

610
00:36:57.050 --> 00:36:58.230
<v Speaker 3>the vehicles engines.</v>

611
00:36:58.700 --> 00:37:03.010
<v Speaker 3>They're going to match that with some </v>
<v Speaker 3>profile that says this is a enemy almost</v>

612
00:37:03.040 --> 00:37:04.770
<v Speaker 3>fighting vehicle as far as we're </v>
<v Speaker 3>concerned.</v>

613
00:37:05.640 --> 00:37:08.700
<v Speaker 3>And then they're going to apply force </v>
<v Speaker 3>downwards from the,</v>

614
00:37:08.701 --> 00:37:13.701
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>using a better of explosive engineering </v>

615
00:37:13.701 --> 00:37:16.491
<v Speaker 3>shape charge which focus a plus a plus </v>
<v Speaker 3>to have explosive basically a jet of </v>

616
00:37:16.770 --> 00:37:19.590
<v Speaker 3>explosives downwards onto the specific </v>
<v Speaker 3>targets.</v>

617
00:37:21.000 --> 00:37:26.000
<v Speaker 3>And so in this situation,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well have the,</v>

618
00:37:28.710 --> 00:37:33.710
<v Speaker 3>has the weapon system chosen the target?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a bit ambiguous because as long as </v>

619
00:37:34.591 --> 00:37:37.770
<v Speaker 3>we conceptualize the group of tanks as </v>
<v Speaker 3>the as the target,</v>

620
00:37:37.800 --> 00:37:42.800
<v Speaker 3>then a human has chosen the target and </v>
<v Speaker 3>the weapon system is essentially just </v>

621
00:37:42.810 --> 00:37:46.500
<v Speaker 3>being efficient in its distribution of </v>
<v Speaker 3>force to the target objects.</v>

622
00:37:47.400 --> 00:37:50.820
<v Speaker 3>But if we see the individual vehicles as</v>
<v Speaker 3>individual targets,</v>

623
00:37:50.821 --> 00:37:55.821
<v Speaker 3>maybe the weapon system has chosen a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the targets potentially some advantages </v>

624
00:37:56.311 --> 00:37:59.250
<v Speaker 3>of automated of autonomy in this </v>
<v Speaker 3>situation.</v>

625
00:37:59.700 --> 00:38:04.700
<v Speaker 3>From my perspective,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this kind of ability to focus a jet of </v>

626
00:38:05.161 --> 00:38:09.150
<v Speaker 3>explosive force directly on the object </v>
<v Speaker 3>that you're looking to strike so long as</v>

627
00:38:09.151 --> 00:38:10.170
<v Speaker 3>you've got the right object.</v>

628
00:38:10.530 --> 00:38:14.430
<v Speaker 3>This is much better than setting off </v>
<v Speaker 3>lots of artillery shells in this area,</v>

629
00:38:14.431 --> 00:38:19.431
<v Speaker 3>which would have a much greater </v>
<v Speaker 3>explosive force effect on the </v>

630
00:38:19.431 --> 00:38:20.850
<v Speaker 3>surrounding area.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Probably put a wider population at risk.</v>

631
00:38:22.440 --> 00:38:26.730
<v Speaker 3>So just sort of set of considerations </v>
<v Speaker 3>here that I think a significant.</v>

632
00:38:26.731 --> 00:38:29.310
<v Speaker 3>So we have these systems,</v>
<v Speaker 3>these systems exist,</v>

633
00:38:29.820 --> 00:38:34.820
<v Speaker 3>exist today.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You could ask questions about whether </v>

634
00:38:34.820 --> 00:38:38.211
<v Speaker 3>those heat shaped profiles of those </v>
<v Speaker 3>objects sufficiently tightly tied to </v>

635
00:38:38.211 --> 00:38:42.780
<v Speaker 3>energy fighting vehicles or whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But I think it can be conceptualized </v>

636
00:38:42.780 --> 00:38:43.420
<v Speaker 3>reasonably straightforwardly in those </v>
<v Speaker 3>times,</v>

637
00:38:45.070 --> 00:38:50.070
<v Speaker 3>but the area where I started having a </v>
<v Speaker 3>problem with this stuff is in the </v>

638
00:38:50.501 --> 00:38:55.501
<v Speaker 3>potential for this circle or this </v>
<v Speaker 3>pattern just to get bigger and bigger </v>

639
00:38:57.071 --> 00:39:00.430
<v Speaker 3>essentially because it's all reasonably </v>
<v Speaker 3>straightforward.</v>

640
00:39:00.431 --> 00:39:04.150
<v Speaker 3>When you put the tanks reasonably close </v>
<v Speaker 3>together and you can envisage having one</v>

641
00:39:04.570 --> 00:39:09.570
<v Speaker 3>sort of one set of information about </v>
<v Speaker 3>this area which allows you to make a </v>

642
00:39:09.570 --> 00:39:10.570
<v Speaker 3>legal determination is that you need to </v>
<v Speaker 3>make.</v>

643
00:39:10.990 --> 00:39:14.650
<v Speaker 3>But once these tanks get spread out over</v>
<v Speaker 3>a much larger area and you have a weapon</v>

644
00:39:14.651 --> 00:39:19.651
<v Speaker 3>system that using basically the same </v>
<v Speaker 3>sorts of technological approach is able </v>

645
00:39:20.081 --> 00:39:25.081
<v Speaker 3>to cover a substantially wider area of </v>
<v Speaker 3>enemy terrain over a longer period of </v>

646
00:39:25.081 --> 00:39:29.821
<v Speaker 3>time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Then it suddenly gets much more </v>

647
00:39:29.821 --> 00:39:32.011
<v Speaker 3>difficult for the.</v>
<v Speaker 3>For the military commander to have any </v>

648
00:39:32.011 --> 00:39:35.880
<v Speaker 3>really detailed information about the </v>
<v Speaker 3>context in which force will actually be </v>

649
00:39:35.880 --> 00:39:36.160
<v Speaker 3>applied.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And for me,</v>

650
00:39:36.161 --> 00:39:41.161
<v Speaker 3>this is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think the main point of anxiety or </v>

651
00:39:41.161 --> 00:39:43.820
<v Speaker 3>point of concern that I have in the way </v>
<v Speaker 3>in which autonomy and weapons systems </v>

652
00:39:43.820 --> 00:39:46.861
<v Speaker 3>is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is likely to develop over the immediate </v>

653
00:39:46.861 --> 00:39:48.430
<v Speaker 3>future.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because under the legal framework,</v>

654
00:39:48.431 --> 00:39:53.431
<v Speaker 3>a military commander has an obligation </v>
<v Speaker 3>to apply certain rules in an attack and </v>

655
00:39:53.701 --> 00:39:58.180
<v Speaker 3>an attack is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not precisely defined,</v>

656
00:39:58.600 --> 00:39:59.980
<v Speaker 3>but it needs to have some,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think,</v>

657
00:39:59.981 --> 00:40:04.981
<v Speaker 3>some spatial and conceptual boundaries </v>
<v Speaker 3>to it that allow a sufficient </v>

658
00:40:04.981 --> 00:40:06.310
<v Speaker 3>granularity of legal application.</v>

659
00:40:07.000 --> 00:40:09.820
<v Speaker 3>Because if you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you treat this as an attack,</v>

660
00:40:09.880 --> 00:40:11.710
<v Speaker 3>I think that's fine as you expand it </v>
<v Speaker 3>out,</v>

661
00:40:11.740 --> 00:40:15.640
<v Speaker 3>so you've got vehicles across a whole </v>
<v Speaker 3>wide area of a country,</v>

662
00:40:16.180 --> 00:40:21.180
<v Speaker 3>say across the country as a whole,</v>
<v Speaker 3>using the same sort of extension logic </v>

663
00:40:21.180 --> 00:40:24.781
<v Speaker 3>has as in some previous arguments.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Once you've got vehicles across the </v>

664
00:40:24.781 --> 00:40:26.140
<v Speaker 3>whole country and you're saying,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in this attack,</v>

665
00:40:26.141 --> 00:40:31.141
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to just talk at the vehicles </v>
<v Speaker 3>of the enemy and you send out your </v>

666
00:40:31.141 --> 00:40:32.100
<v Speaker 3>warheads across the whole location.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now,</v>

667
00:40:32.101 --> 00:40:34.600
<v Speaker 3>I don't think that's gonna happen in the</v>
<v Speaker 3>immediate term,</v>

668
00:40:34.601 --> 00:40:38.830
<v Speaker 3>but I'm just using that as a sort of </v>
<v Speaker 3>conceptual challenge.</v>

669
00:40:39.310 --> 00:40:42.880
<v Speaker 3>You start to have applications of actual</v>
<v Speaker 3>physical force in all sorts of locations</v>

670
00:40:42.881 --> 00:40:47.881
<v Speaker 3>where a commander really can't assess in</v>
<v Speaker 3>any realistic way what the actual </v>

671
00:40:47.881 --> 00:40:50.670
<v Speaker 3>effects of that are going to be.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I think at that point you can't.</v>

672
00:40:50.710 --> 00:40:55.710
<v Speaker 3>You can no longer say that there is </v>
<v Speaker 3>sufficient a human control being being </v>

673
00:40:55.710 --> 00:40:59.761
<v Speaker 3>applied,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so this capacity of ai enabled systems </v>

674
00:41:00.521 --> 00:41:05.521
<v Speaker 3>or ai driven systems to expand the </v>
<v Speaker 3>attacks across a much wider geographical</v>

675
00:41:05.741 --> 00:41:10.741
<v Speaker 3>area and potentially over a longer </v>
<v Speaker 3>period of time I think is a significant </v>

676
00:41:10.741 --> 00:41:13.510
<v Speaker 3>challenge to how the legal framework is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is understood at present,</v>

677
00:41:13.810 --> 00:41:18.810
<v Speaker 3>not one that relies upon determinations </v>
<v Speaker 3>about whether this weapon system will </v>

678
00:41:18.810 --> 00:41:23.520
<v Speaker 3>apply the rules properly or not,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but rather one which involves the </v>

679
00:41:24.460 --> 00:41:29.460
<v Speaker 3>frequency and the proximity of human </v>
<v Speaker 3>decision making to be sort of diluted a </v>

680
00:41:29.590 --> 00:41:31.930
<v Speaker 3>progressively over progressively over </v>
<v Speaker 3>time.</v>

681
00:41:31.960 --> 00:41:35.200
<v Speaker 3>So that's a significant area of concern </v>
<v Speaker 3>for me.</v>

682
00:41:36.020 --> 00:41:41.020
<v Speaker 3>Final sort of set of concerns in these </v>
<v Speaker 3>areas is around these issues about </v>

683
00:41:41.020 --> 00:41:44.210
<v Speaker 3>encoding of targets.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think we could say pretty clearly that</v>

684
00:41:44.240 --> 00:41:49.240
<v Speaker 3>weight is a very mega,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a basis for evaluating whether something</v>

685
00:41:51.021 --> 00:41:52.880
<v Speaker 3>is a valid military target.</v>

686
00:41:52.880 --> 00:41:55.150
<v Speaker 3>All right,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

687
00:41:55.190 --> 00:42:00.190
<v Speaker 3>the significant problems,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's suggesting that we could just </v>

688
00:42:00.190 --> 00:42:03.011
<v Speaker 3>take the weight of something as being </v>
<v Speaker 3>sufficient for us to decide is this a </v>

689
00:42:03.011 --> 00:42:05.780
<v Speaker 3>target or not.</v>
<v Speaker 3>In any of these processes,</v>

690
00:42:06.020 --> 00:42:11.020
<v Speaker 3>we have to decide that certain patterns </v>
<v Speaker 3>of data represent a military objects of </v>

691
00:42:12.231 --> 00:42:17.231
<v Speaker 3>some type and of course in a way I think</v>
<v Speaker 3>what we sort of see in sort of </v>

692
00:42:17.231 --> 00:42:21.641
<v Speaker 3>proponents of greater and greater </v>
<v Speaker 3>autonomy and weapons systems is a sense </v>

693
00:42:21.641 --> 00:42:21.641
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

694
00:42:21.641 --> 00:42:25.990
<v Speaker 3>as we expand the scope of this attack,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we just need to have a more </v>

695
00:42:25.990 --> 00:42:29.171
<v Speaker 3>sophisticated system that's undertaking </v>
<v Speaker 3>the attack that can take on more of the </v>

696
00:42:29.171 --> 00:42:30.940
<v Speaker 3>evaluation and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and more of this,</v>

697
00:42:30.941 --> 00:42:35.941
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>process of basically mapping the coding </v>

698
00:42:35.941 --> 00:42:38.270
<v Speaker 3>of the world into a set of decisions </v>
<v Speaker 3>about the application of force.</v>

699
00:42:39.260 --> 00:42:42.770
<v Speaker 3>But overall,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

700
00:42:42.771 --> 00:42:47.771
<v Speaker 3>I'm skeptical about the way in which our</v>
<v Speaker 3>social systems are likely to go about </v>

701
00:42:47.771 --> 00:42:52.690
<v Speaker 3>mapping people's indicators of </v>
<v Speaker 3>identities into some sort of fixed sense</v>

702
00:42:52.881 --> 00:42:57.881
<v Speaker 3>of military objects or military targets </v>
<v Speaker 3>as a society over the last hundred </v>

703
00:42:59.930 --> 00:42:59.930
<v Speaker 3>years.</v>

704
00:43:00.260 --> 00:43:05.260
<v Speaker 3>There's been plenty of times where we've</v>
<v Speaker 3>applied certain labels to certain types </v>

705
00:43:05.271 --> 00:43:06.890
<v Speaker 3>of people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>certain groups of people,</v>

706
00:43:07.080 --> 00:43:09.380
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>based on various indicators,</v>

707
00:43:09.620 --> 00:43:14.620
<v Speaker 3>which apparently seemed reasonable to </v>
<v Speaker 3>some significant section of society at </v>

708
00:43:15.441 --> 00:43:20.441
<v Speaker 3>the time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But then ultimately I think we've </v>

709
00:43:20.441 --> 00:43:20.441
<v Speaker 3>subsequently thought,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

710
00:43:20.441 --> 00:43:23.771
<v Speaker 3>highly problematic.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so I think we need to be very wary </v>

711
00:43:23.771 --> 00:43:26.990
<v Speaker 3>of any sort of ideas of thinking that we</v>
<v Speaker 3>can encode in terms of humans,</v>

712
00:43:26.991 --> 00:43:31.430
<v Speaker 3>particularly I'm very concrete </v>
<v Speaker 3>indicators that certain groups of people</v>

713
00:43:31.431 --> 00:43:36.431
<v Speaker 3>should be considered by the targets or </v>
<v Speaker 3>not just going to say a couple of final </v>

714
00:43:37.580 --> 00:43:42.580
<v Speaker 3>things about future discussions in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>CCW.</v>

715
00:43:43.910 --> 00:43:45.980
<v Speaker 3>The chair of the Group of governmental </v>
<v Speaker 3>experts,</v>

716
00:43:45.981 --> 00:43:48.410
<v Speaker 3>that's the body that's going discuss </v>
<v Speaker 3>autonomous weapons,</v>

717
00:43:48.810 --> 00:43:53.810
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>has us states for the next meeting we </v>

718
00:43:53.810 --> 00:43:55.721
<v Speaker 3>should take place in April to come </v>
<v Speaker 3>prepared with ideas about the </v>

719
00:43:55.721 --> 00:43:58.010
<v Speaker 3>touchpoints of human machine </v>
<v Speaker 3>interaction.</v>

720
00:43:58.970 --> 00:44:03.970
<v Speaker 3>This is a sort of code for one of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>ways in which we can control technology.</v>

721
00:44:04.580 --> 00:44:07.640
<v Speaker 3>So I suppose from our context as an </v>
<v Speaker 3>organization,</v>

722
00:44:08.570 --> 00:44:13.570
<v Speaker 3>we'll be looking to get states to start </v>
<v Speaker 3>to try and lay out this kind of </v>

723
00:44:13.570 --> 00:44:17.141
<v Speaker 3>framework as being the basis for their </v>
<v Speaker 3>perception of the ways in which the </v>

724
00:44:17.141 --> 00:44:19.100
<v Speaker 3>entry points to control of technology </v>
<v Speaker 3>could be thought about.</v>

725
00:44:19.670 --> 00:44:24.670
<v Speaker 3>Again,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's really a question of structuring </v>

726
00:44:24.670 --> 00:44:26.321
<v Speaker 3>the debate.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We won't get into detail across all of </v>

727
00:44:26.321 --> 00:44:29.531
<v Speaker 3>this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I think it's plausible that this </v>

728
00:44:29.531 --> 00:44:32.410
<v Speaker 3>year and next we'll start to see the </v>
<v Speaker 3>debate falling into some adoption of </v>

729
00:44:32.410 --> 00:44:34.890
<v Speaker 3>this kind of framework,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which I think will give us some tools to</v>

730
00:44:34.891 --> 00:44:37.620
<v Speaker 3>work with.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think at least if we start to get some</v>

731
00:44:37.621 --> 00:44:42.621
<v Speaker 3>agreement from a significant body of </v>
<v Speaker 3>states that these are the sort of entry </v>

732
00:44:42.621 --> 00:44:45.860
<v Speaker 3>points we should be thinking about in </v>
<v Speaker 3>terms of control of technology that will</v>

733
00:44:45.861 --> 00:44:50.861
<v Speaker 3>give us a bit of leverage for a start </v>
<v Speaker 3>towards suggesting an overarching </v>

734
00:44:50.861 --> 00:44:55.301
<v Speaker 3>obligation that there should be some </v>
<v Speaker 3>sort of meaningful or sufficient human </v>

735
00:44:55.301 --> 00:44:55.301
<v Speaker 3>control,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

736
00:44:55.301 --> 00:44:59.920
<v Speaker 3>but also in a way of thinking about that</v>
<v Speaker 3>and interrogating that as new </v>

737
00:44:59.920 --> 00:44:59.920
<v Speaker 3>technologies develop in the future,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

738
00:44:59.920 --> 00:45:01.580
<v Speaker 3>that we can leverage in some.</v>

739
00:45:01.700 --> 00:45:05.430
<v Speaker 3>In some ways I felt reasonably confident</v>
<v Speaker 3>about that.</v>

740
00:45:05.490 --> 00:45:08.490
<v Speaker 3>But it's a difficult political </v>
<v Speaker 3>environment and you know,</v>

741
00:45:08.640 --> 00:45:13.640
<v Speaker 3>it's quite possible that I don't see any</v>
<v Speaker 3>rush amongst states to move towards any </v>

742
00:45:13.640 --> 00:45:14.880
<v Speaker 3>legal controls in this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in this area.</v>

743
00:45:15.900 --> 00:45:20.900
<v Speaker 3>Just as a few very final thoughts,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which may be a bit more abstract in my </v>

744
00:45:20.900 --> 00:45:22.590
<v Speaker 3>thinking on this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I feel like,</v>

745
00:45:23.740 --> 00:45:27.340
<v Speaker 3>and this sort of reflecting on maybe </v>
<v Speaker 3>some dynamics of ai functioning,</v>

746
00:45:28.110 --> 00:45:31.930
<v Speaker 3>my anxiety here about the expansion of </v>
<v Speaker 3>the concept of attacks and in the same,</v>

747
00:45:32.960 --> 00:45:37.960
<v Speaker 3>in conjunction with that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a sort of breaking down of the </v>

748
00:45:37.960 --> 00:45:39.740
<v Speaker 3>granularity of the legal framework.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think this is another,</v>

749
00:45:40.310 --> 00:45:45.310
<v Speaker 3>a sort of generalizing function again,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and it's a movement away from more </v>

750
00:45:45.310 --> 00:45:49.631
<v Speaker 3>specific legal application by humans to </v>
<v Speaker 3>perhaps a pushing humans people towards </v>

751
00:45:52.210 --> 00:45:54.720
<v Speaker 3>a more general,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a legal orientation.</v>

752
00:45:54.721 --> 00:45:57.700
<v Speaker 3>And I feel like in the context of </v>
<v Speaker 3>conflict,</v>

753
00:45:57.910 --> 00:46:02.910
<v Speaker 3>we should be pushing for a more specific</v>
<v Speaker 3>and more focused and more regular,</v>

754
00:46:03.520 --> 00:46:08.520
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>application of human judgments and </v>

755
00:46:08.520 --> 00:46:08.520
<v Speaker 3>moral.</v>

756
00:46:08.520 --> 00:46:11.290
<v Speaker 3>A moral agency that isn't to say that I </v>
<v Speaker 3>think humans are perfect in any way.</v>

757
00:46:11.350 --> 00:46:13.150
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's lots of problems with humans,</v>

758
00:46:13.780 --> 00:46:18.780
<v Speaker 3>but at the same time I think the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we should be very wary of thinking that </v>

759
00:46:18.780 --> 00:46:21.380
<v Speaker 3>violence is something that can be </v>
<v Speaker 3>somehow perfected and that we can encode</v>

760
00:46:22.040 --> 00:46:27.040
<v Speaker 3>how to conduct violence in some </v>
<v Speaker 3>machinery that will then provide an </v>

761
00:46:27.231 --> 00:46:30.700
<v Speaker 3>adequate social product for society as </v>
<v Speaker 3>a,</v>

762
00:46:30.701 --> 00:46:33.380
<v Speaker 3>as a whole.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I guess it was a very final thought,</v>

763
00:46:33.381 --> 00:46:37.340
<v Speaker 3>a bit linked to that is some questions </v>
<v Speaker 3>in my mind about how this all relates to</v>

764
00:46:37.341 --> 00:46:42.341
<v Speaker 3>bureaucracy in a way and in a sense that</v>
<v Speaker 3>some of the functions that we're saying </v>

765
00:46:42.341 --> 00:46:45.791
<v Speaker 3>here and some of the Ai functions that </v>
<v Speaker 3>we see here in many ways related to </v>

766
00:46:45.800 --> 00:46:50.800
<v Speaker 3>bureaucracy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to the encoding and categorization of </v>

767
00:46:50.800 --> 00:46:54.491
<v Speaker 3>data in certain ways and just a very </v>
<v Speaker 3>fast management of that bureaucracy,</v>

768
00:46:55.760 --> 00:46:58.310
<v Speaker 3>which is really an extension of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>bureaucracies that we already,</v>

769
00:46:58.540 --> 00:47:03.540
<v Speaker 3>that we already have.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I think extending that to far into </v>

770
00:47:03.540 --> 00:47:06.660
<v Speaker 3>the world of violence and the </v>
<v Speaker 3>application of force to people will well</v>

771
00:47:06.661 --> 00:47:09.750
<v Speaker 3>precipitate painful effects for us as a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>as a society.</v>

772
00:47:09.751 --> 00:47:14.751
<v Speaker 3>And as it brings to the fore.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think some of the underpinning </v>

773
00:47:14.751 --> 00:47:15.120
<v Speaker 3>underpinnings of the rationales of that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

774
00:47:15.130 --> 00:47:18.290
<v Speaker 3>of that bureaucratic framework so that </v>
<v Speaker 3>we go.</v>

775
00:47:18.310 --> 00:47:21.260
<v Speaker 3>It's a bit of a broad brush sketch.</v>

776
00:47:23.070 --> 00:47:28.070
<v Speaker 2>Thank you.</v>

777
00:47:31.080 --> 00:47:32.060
<v Speaker 4>So,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

778
00:47:32.190 --> 00:47:34.510
<v Speaker 4>this question's kind of a little bit of </v>
<v Speaker 4>multifaceted,</v>

779
00:47:34.511 --> 00:47:35.600
<v Speaker 4>but,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

780
00:47:35.800 --> 00:47:39.130
<v Speaker 4>as humans evolve and adapt to </v>
<v Speaker 4>increasingly autonomous weapons,</v>

781
00:47:39.520 --> 00:47:44.520
<v Speaker 4>the complexity and sophistication could </v>
<v Speaker 4>increase with expansion of targets and </v>

782
00:47:44.520 --> 00:47:48.340
<v Speaker 4>types and target area is.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Do you think there's a limit to which we</v>

783
00:47:48.341 --> 00:47:52.030
<v Speaker 4>can prepare against such an evolution </v>
<v Speaker 4>and a,</v>

784
00:47:52.210 --> 00:47:56.410
<v Speaker 4>do you think that'd be ocracy can keep </v>
<v Speaker 4>up with how fast these,</v>

785
00:47:57.040 --> 00:47:59.680
<v Speaker 4>the autonomy of you couldn't develop </v>
<v Speaker 4>over time?</v>

786
00:48:00.680 --> 00:48:05.680
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not sure I caught all the first bit </v>

787
00:48:05.680 --> 00:48:05.680
<v Speaker 1>of the question,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there's definitely,</v>

788
00:48:05.680 --> 00:48:09.970
<v Speaker 1>it's definitely a challenge that the </v>
<v Speaker 1>types of legal discussions at the UN </v>

789
00:48:09.970 --> 00:48:13.820
<v Speaker 1>Convention on Conventional Weapons,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they are not famous for going too </v>

790
00:48:13.820 --> 00:48:14.570
<v Speaker 1>quickly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>

791
00:48:14.750 --> 00:48:18.050
<v Speaker 1>they're incredibly slow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And in that framework,</v>

792
00:48:18.051 --> 00:48:21.470
<v Speaker 1>every state essentially has a veto over </v>
<v Speaker 1>everything.</v>

793
00:48:21.770 --> 00:48:23.900
<v Speaker 1>So even over the agenda of the next </v>
<v Speaker 1>meeting,</v>

794
00:48:24.310 --> 00:48:26.930
<v Speaker 1>if you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if the US wants to block the agenda,</v>

795
00:48:26.931 --> 00:48:31.931
<v Speaker 1>they can lock the agenda,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let alone block the outcome that might </v>

796
00:48:31.931 --> 00:48:32.630
<v Speaker 1>come if you could agree on agenda.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

797
00:48:32.850 --> 00:48:36.740
<v Speaker 1>so every state has an ability to keep </v>
<v Speaker 1>things moving very slowly there.</v>

798
00:48:36.950 --> 00:48:41.950
<v Speaker 1>And that's definitely a challenge in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>context where the pace of technological </v>

799
00:48:41.950 --> 00:48:44.600
<v Speaker 1>development moves pretty quickly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The only thing I would say,</v>

800
00:48:44.780 --> 00:48:49.780
<v Speaker 1>which I forgot to mention before in </v>
<v Speaker 1>terms of thinking about the dynamics in </v>

801
00:48:49.780 --> 00:48:52.871
<v Speaker 1>this debate,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that it's not straightforwardly a </v>

802
00:48:52.871 --> 00:48:55.860
<v Speaker 1>situation where militaries really want </v>
<v Speaker 1>loads more autonomous weapons and other </v>

803
00:48:56.421 --> 00:49:01.421
<v Speaker 1>people don't have in military commanders</v>
<v Speaker 1>also like control and they they like </v>

804
00:49:01.550 --> 00:49:06.550
<v Speaker 1>troops on the ground like control and </v>
<v Speaker 1>they like trust and confidence in the </v>

805
00:49:06.550 --> 00:49:06.620
<v Speaker 1>systems that they're operating around.</v>

806
00:49:06.980 --> 00:49:11.980
<v Speaker 1>They don't want to get blown up by their</v>
<v Speaker 1>own equipment and military commanders </v>

807
00:49:11.980 --> 00:49:13.100
<v Speaker 1>like controlling and like to know what's</v>
<v Speaker 1>happening.</v>

808
00:49:13.101 --> 00:49:16.940
<v Speaker 1>So there are some constraints within the</v>
<v Speaker 1>military structures as well.</v>

809
00:49:18.680 --> 00:49:23.680
<v Speaker 1>So the overall sort of development here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I guess from our side in terms of this </v>

810
00:49:23.680 --> 00:49:27.221
<v Speaker 1>sort of how to constrain against the </v>
<v Speaker 1>expansion of attacks and the expansion </v>

811
00:49:27.221 --> 00:49:31.571
<v Speaker 1>of sort of objects that may be attacked </v>
<v Speaker 1>by autonomous systems in a way.</v>

812
00:49:31.911 --> 00:49:36.911
<v Speaker 1>That's where I felt like developing the </v>
<v Speaker 1>idea that there's a principle of human </v>

813
00:49:36.911 --> 00:49:40.391
<v Speaker 1>control that needs to be applied.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Even if it's a bit fuzzy in its </v>

814
00:49:40.391 --> 00:49:44.200
<v Speaker 1>boundaries,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we can use that and interrogated as a </v>

815
00:49:44.200 --> 00:49:47.021
<v Speaker 1>social process to try and keep </v>
<v Speaker 1>constraint going back towards the </v>

816
00:49:47.021 --> 00:49:50.000
<v Speaker 1>specific because in the end,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like I said earlier,</v>

817
00:49:50.001 --> 00:49:55.001
<v Speaker 1>these legal structures or sort of social</v>
<v Speaker 1>processes as well and it's not very </v>

818
00:49:55.001 --> 00:49:59.441
<v Speaker 1>easy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not something where you can just </v>

819
00:49:59.441 --> 00:49:59.441
<v Speaker 1>straightforward to draw a line and then </v>
<v Speaker 1>no new technologies will come along that</v>

820
00:49:59.441 --> 00:50:01.310
<v Speaker 1>challenge your expectations,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

821
00:50:01.990 --> 00:50:06.320
<v Speaker 1>We need to find the sort of camp on the </v>
<v Speaker 1>international legal political landscape.</v>

822
00:50:06.620 --> 00:50:11.000
<v Speaker 1>We need to sketch out the parameters of </v>
<v Speaker 1>that come in legal terms.</v>

823
00:50:11.380 --> 00:50:15.920
<v Speaker 1>Then we need people to turn up at those </v>
<v Speaker 1>meetings and continuously complain about</v>

824
00:50:15.921 --> 00:50:20.921
<v Speaker 1>things and put pressure on things </v>
<v Speaker 1>because that's the only way over time </v>

825
00:50:20.921 --> 00:50:24.071
<v Speaker 1>where you maintain that sort of </v>
<v Speaker 1>interrogation of future technologies as </v>

826
00:50:24.071 --> 00:50:25.560
<v Speaker 1>they come out of the pipeline or or </v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever.</v>

827
00:50:25.640 --> 00:50:27.590
<v Speaker 1>So it's a sort of social I think.</v>

828
00:50:28.010 --> 00:50:33.010
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that answered my question is like the </v>

829
00:50:33.010 --> 00:50:34.871
<v Speaker 4>balance between like how fast science </v>
<v Speaker 4>would be like advancing in this field </v>

830
00:50:34.871 --> 00:50:36.590
<v Speaker 4>versus like how fast we obviously can </v>
<v Speaker 4>move to keep up</v>

831
00:50:37.740 --> 00:50:39.140
<v Speaker 1>be resolved.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's an ongoing.</v>

832
00:50:39.141 --> 00:50:41.600
<v Speaker 1>It's got to be an ongoing social </v>
<v Speaker 1>political process in a way.</v>

833
00:50:41.601 --> 00:50:41.820
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

834
00:50:41.930 --> 00:50:42.620
<v Speaker 4>Awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Thank you.</v>

835
00:50:45.400 --> 00:50:45.830
<v Speaker 4>So</v>

836
00:50:46.480 --> 00:50:51.480
<v Speaker 1>given that this course is on Agi and </v>
<v Speaker 1>we'll likely see a wide variety of </v>

837
00:50:51.480 --> 00:50:53.980
<v Speaker 1>different kinds of autonomous systems in</v>
<v Speaker 1>the future,</v>

838
00:50:54.430 --> 00:50:59.430
<v Speaker 1>can you give us perhaps some sort of </v>
<v Speaker 1>extrapolation from this domain to a </v>

839
00:50:59.430 --> 00:51:04.080
<v Speaker 1>broader set of potentially risky </v>
<v Speaker 1>behaviors that more autonomous and more </v>

840
00:51:04.080 --> 00:51:09.001
<v Speaker 1>intelligent systems would do and ways </v>
<v Speaker 1>that the creators of such systems such </v>

841
00:51:09.001 --> 00:51:13.891
<v Speaker 1>as potentially the folks sitting in this</v>
<v Speaker 1>room can change what they're doing to </v>

842
00:51:13.891 --> 00:51:15.380
<v Speaker 1>make those safer?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

843
00:51:15.440 --> 00:51:20.440
<v Speaker 1>I mean I think useful to think about in </v>
<v Speaker 1>some ways these ideas of from the </v>

844
00:51:22.790 --> 00:51:23.990
<v Speaker 1>president,</v>
<v Speaker 1>from where we are now,</v>

845
00:51:23.991 --> 00:51:27.410
<v Speaker 1>how can people involved in developing </v>
<v Speaker 1>different technologies,</v>

846
00:51:27.440 --> 00:51:32.440
<v Speaker 1>new technological capacities,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just be thinking of the potential </v>

847
00:51:32.440 --> 00:51:36.800
<v Speaker 1>outcomes in this sort of weaponization </v>
<v Speaker 1>area and building in some orientation to</v>

848
00:51:36.801 --> 00:51:41.801
<v Speaker 1>their work that thinks about that and </v>
<v Speaker 1>thinks about what the potential </v>

849
00:51:41.801 --> 00:51:44.000
<v Speaker 1>consequences of work can be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

850
00:51:44.001 --> 00:51:47.960
<v Speaker 1>I think in some ways the risk outcomes </v>
<v Speaker 1>type thinking.</v>

851
00:51:47.990 --> 00:51:51.860
<v Speaker 1>I mean again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it gets you into hypothetical arguments,</v>

852
00:51:51.861 --> 00:51:54.050
<v Speaker 1>but they.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The idea of two sides,</v>

853
00:51:54.051 --> 00:51:59.051
<v Speaker 1>both with substantial autonomous weapons</v>
<v Speaker 1>system capabilities is probably the sort</v>

854
00:51:59.151 --> 00:52:04.151
<v Speaker 1>of area where these ideas of accidental </v>
<v Speaker 1>escalations come to the fore,</v>

855
00:52:04.731 --> 00:52:09.731
<v Speaker 1>that if you've got to adversarily </v>
<v Speaker 1>orientated states with substantial </v>

856
00:52:12.920 --> 00:52:17.920
<v Speaker 1>autonomous systems,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then there's a potential for </v>

857
00:52:17.920 --> 00:52:20.381
<v Speaker 1>interactions to occur between those </v>
<v Speaker 1>systems that rapidly escalating violence</v>

858
00:52:20.541 --> 00:52:25.541
<v Speaker 1>situation in a way that greater capacity</v>
<v Speaker 1>for human engagement would allow you to,</v>

859
00:52:26.400 --> 00:52:30.020
<v Speaker 1>to curtail it and stole it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I think,</v>

860
00:52:30.380 --> 00:52:32.400
<v Speaker 1>I mean I know in other areas of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

861
00:52:32.780 --> 00:52:37.190
<v Speaker 1>of Algo written functioning in society,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we've seen aspects of that,</v>

862
00:52:37.191 --> 00:52:42.191
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And sort of probably in the financial </v>

863
00:52:42.191 --> 00:52:42.640
<v Speaker 1>sector and other such location.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So.</v>

864
00:52:43.020 --> 00:52:46.160
<v Speaker 1>So I think yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>those are those ideas of sort of rapidly</v>

865
00:52:46.161 --> 00:52:49.800
<v Speaker 1>escalating,</v>
<v Speaker 1>cascading risks is a,</v>

866
00:52:50.270 --> 00:52:51.740
<v Speaker 1>is a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is a concern in that area.</v>

867
00:52:51.800 --> 00:52:54.740
<v Speaker 1>But again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>based on hypothetical thinking about</v>

868
00:52:55.020 --> 00:52:57.420
<v Speaker 4>stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Last question,</v>

869
00:52:58.010 --> 00:52:58.520
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

870
00:52:58.920 --> 00:53:03.920
<v Speaker 5>What do you think of this criteria?</v>
<v Speaker 5>So we have this tank example on the </v>

871
00:53:03.991 --> 00:53:06.600
<v Speaker 5>right,</v>
<v Speaker 5>our simulations,</v>

872
00:53:06.601 --> 00:53:09.060
<v Speaker 5>our ability to simulate things is </v>
<v Speaker 5>getting better and better.</v>

873
00:53:09.960 --> 00:53:14.960
<v Speaker 5>What if we showed a simulation of what </v>
<v Speaker 5>would happen to a person that has the </v>

874
00:53:15.841 --> 00:53:20.841
<v Speaker 5>ability to hit the go button on it and </v>
<v Speaker 5>if the simulation does not have enough </v>

875
00:53:20.841 --> 00:53:25.461
<v Speaker 5>fidelity,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we consider that a Nogo we cannot do </v>

876
00:53:25.861 --> 00:53:30.861
<v Speaker 5>that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Or if the simulation shows it does have </v>

877
00:53:30.861 --> 00:53:32.460
<v Speaker 5>enough fidelity and it shows a,</v>
<v Speaker 5>a bad outcome,</v>

878
00:53:33.660 --> 00:53:37.990
<v Speaker 5>then maybe that would be a criteria in </v>
<v Speaker 5>which to,</v>

879
00:53:38.710 --> 00:53:41.730
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>to judge this circumstance on the right.</v>

880
00:53:41.731 --> 00:53:46.731
<v Speaker 5>And that could also let us a,</v>
<v Speaker 5>as that circle gets bigger and bigger,</v>

881
00:53:46.890 --> 00:53:49.910
<v Speaker 5>it can let us kind of put a,</v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

882
00:53:50.790 --> 00:53:53.430
<v Speaker 5>it could let us cap that by saying,</v>
<v Speaker 5>hey,</v>

883
00:53:53.431 --> 00:53:58.431
<v Speaker 5>if we don't,</v>
<v Speaker 5>if we do not have enough information to </v>

884
00:53:58.431 --> 00:54:00.270
<v Speaker 5>make this a simulation to even show the </v>
<v Speaker 5>person,</v>

885
00:54:00.510 --> 00:54:01.860
<v Speaker 5>then it's a no go.</v>

886
00:54:02.280 --> 00:54:03.780
<v Speaker 1>Yup.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yup.</v>

887
00:54:03.840 --> 00:54:07.770
<v Speaker 1>I think in a way this is an issue of </v>
<v Speaker 1>modeling,</v>

888
00:54:07.771 --> 00:54:12.771
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Based on contextual information that </v>

889
00:54:12.771 --> 00:54:12.771
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that you have.</v>

890
00:54:12.771 --> 00:54:16.281
<v Speaker 1>So maybe with technological developments</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have a better capacity for modeling </v>

891
00:54:17.460 --> 00:54:22.200
<v Speaker 1>specific situations.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I suppose the challenge is how do you,</v>

892
00:54:22.580 --> 00:54:27.580
<v Speaker 1>in a sort of timely manner,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially in a conflict environment </v>

893
00:54:27.580 --> 00:54:29.550
<v Speaker 1>where tempo is significant.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Can you,</v>

894
00:54:29.730 --> 00:54:34.730
<v Speaker 1>can you put the data that you have into </v>
<v Speaker 1>some sort of modeling system adequately,</v>

895
00:54:35.191 --> 00:54:40.191
<v Speaker 1>but I don't see any problem with the </v>
<v Speaker 1>idea of using ai to model the outcomes </v>

896
00:54:42.091 --> 00:54:47.091
<v Speaker 1>of specific attacks and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>give you read outs on what the likely </v>

897
00:54:47.091 --> 00:54:49.560
<v Speaker 1>effects are going to be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I guess the challenges that,</v>

898
00:54:49.620 --> 00:54:54.620
<v Speaker 1>what counts are adequate effect where </v>
<v Speaker 1>the boundary lines have sufficient </v>

899
00:54:54.620 --> 00:54:58.881
<v Speaker 1>information and insufficient information</v>
<v Speaker 1>fall that kind of open questions as </v>

900
00:54:58.881 --> 00:54:58.881
<v Speaker 1>well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

901
00:54:58.881 --> 00:55:03.861
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>military is tend to like to leave some </v>

902
00:55:03.861 --> 00:55:05.070
<v Speaker 1>openness on those,</v>
<v Speaker 1>those points as well.</v>

903
00:55:05.071 --> 00:55:10.071
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I think that can be definitely a </v>

904
00:55:10.071 --> 00:55:10.860
<v Speaker 1>goal for modeling and in better </v>
<v Speaker 1>understanding what the facts.</v>

905
00:55:10.861 --> 00:55:14.550
<v Speaker 1>It cannot be great.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Give Richard a big hand.</v>

906
00:55:15.030 --> 00:55:15.630
<v Speaker 2>Thank you very much.</v>
