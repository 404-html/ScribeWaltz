00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:04.380
The following is a conversation with Greta van Rossum,
creator of Python,

2
00:00:04.630 --> 00:00:08.850
and one of the most popular programming languages in the world used in almost

3
00:00:08.851 --> 00:00:12.480
any application that involves computers from web,

4
00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:17.550
backend development to psychology,
neuroscience,
computer vision,
robotics,

5
00:00:17.551 --> 00:00:22.260
deep learning,
natural language processing,
and almost any subfield of Ai.

6
00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:27.690
This conversation as part of MIT course on artificial general intelligence and

7
00:00:27.691 --> 00:00:30.810
the artificial intelligence podcast.

11
00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:45.690
And now here's my conversation with Guido winter.
Awesome.

12
00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:51.350
You were born in the Netherlands in 1956 your parents in the world around you

13
00:00:52.351 --> 00:00:57.351
was deeply impacted by World War II as well as my family from the Soviet Union.

14
00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:00.390
So with that context,

15
00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:04.380
what is your view of human nature?

16
00:01:05.130 --> 00:01:10.130
Are some humans inherently good and some inherently evil or do we all have both

17
00:01:10.891 --> 00:01:12.480
good and evil within us?

18
00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:15.883
<v 2>Ouch.</v>

19
00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:20.930
I did not expect a such a deep one.
I,

20
00:01:21.650 --> 00:01:26.300
I guess we all have good and evil potential in us,

21
00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:31.360
and a lot of it depends on circumstances and context

22
00:01:33.110 --> 00:01:37.550
<v 0>out of that world,
at least on the Soviet Union side in Europe,</v>

23
00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:40.430
sort of out of suffering,
out of challenge,

24
00:01:40.431 --> 00:01:45.431
out of that kind of a set of traumatic events often emerge as beautiful art,

25
00:01:46.881 --> 00:01:51.380
music literature.
In a interview I read or heard,

26
00:01:51.381 --> 00:01:56.190
you said you enjoyed Dutch literature when you were a child.
Can,

27
00:01:56.240 --> 00:02:00.290
can you tell me about the books that had an influence on you in your childhood?

28
00:02:01.480 --> 00:02:03.250
<v 2>Well,
west as a teenager,</v>

29
00:02:03.251 --> 00:02:08.251
my favorite writer was my favorite Dutch author was a guy named that [inaudible]

30
00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:14.440
who's writing,

31
00:02:14.710 --> 00:02:19.710
certainly his early novels were all about sort of,

32
00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:23.343
<v 1>uh,</v>

33
00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:26.950
<v 2>ambiguous things that happened during World War II.</v>

34
00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:32.740
I think he was a young adult during that time and he wrote about it

35
00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:40.220
a lot and very interesting,
very good books I thought.

36
00:02:40.490 --> 00:02:44.630
I think in a nonfiction way,
no,

37
00:02:44.631 --> 00:02:45.800
it was all fiction,

38
00:02:45.801 --> 00:02:50.801
but it was very much set in in the ambiguous world of resistance against the

39
00:02:52.161 --> 00:02:53.090
Germans

40
00:02:54.650 --> 00:02:58.010
where often you couldn't tell whether someone,

41
00:02:59.330 --> 00:03:04.330
it was truly in the resistance or really a spy for the Germans and then some of

42
00:03:06.131 --> 00:03:06.600
the character

43
00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:11.600
<v 0>jurors in his novels sort of cross that line and you never really find out what</v>

44
00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:14.100
exactly happened.

45
00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:19.440
And in his novels there was always a good guy and a bad guy is the nature of

46
00:03:19.441 --> 00:03:22.350
good and evil.
Is it clear there's a hero?

47
00:03:22.490 --> 00:03:25.220
<v 2>It's no,
his heroes are often more,</v>

48
00:03:25.221 --> 00:03:30.050
his main characters are often anti heroes and and and so they're,

49
00:03:30.051 --> 00:03:33.320
they're are not,
not very heroic.
Dare,

50
00:03:33.350 --> 00:03:35.450
dare often date

51
00:03:36.610 --> 00:03:41.610
<v 0>day fail at some level to accomplish their lofty goals and looking at the</v>

52
00:03:42.551 --> 00:03:45.430
trajectory through the rest of your life.
Has Literature,

53
00:03:45.730 --> 00:03:49.180
Dutch or English or translation had an impact

54
00:03:50.710 --> 00:03:55.390
outside of the technical world that you existed in?
Hmm.

55
00:03:58.240 --> 00:04:00.370
<v 2>I still read novels.</v>

56
00:04:00.820 --> 00:04:05.560
I don't think that it impacts me that much directly.

57
00:04:06.340 --> 00:04:08.810
<v 0>Does it impact your work is just,
it's a,</v>

58
00:04:08.980 --> 00:04:11.310
<v 2>it's a separate world.
My work is,</v>

59
00:04:11.340 --> 00:04:14.760
is highly technical and sort of the,

60
00:04:14.770 --> 00:04:19.420
the world of art and literature doesn't really directly have any bearing on it.

61
00:04:20.450 --> 00:04:24.350
<v 0>You don't think there's a creative element to the design?
You know,</v>

62
00:04:24.351 --> 00:04:27.110
some would say art design of a language is art.

63
00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:28.633
<v 1>Uh,</v>

64
00:04:30.690 --> 00:04:35.280
<v 2>I'm not disagreeing with that.
I'm just saying that sort of,</v>

65
00:04:35.340 --> 00:04:39.720
I don't feel direct influences from more traditional

66
00:04:39.780 --> 00:04:43.530
<v 0>art on my own creativity.
All right.
Of course you don't feel,</v>

67
00:04:43.531 --> 00:04:48.520
it doesn't mean it's not somehow deeply there and your subconscious knows,

68
00:04:48.980 --> 00:04:52.500
who knows.
So let's go back to your early teens,

69
00:04:52.560 --> 00:04:57.000
your hobbies or building electronic circuits,

70
00:04:57.001 --> 00:04:58.880
building mechanical models.
Uh Huh.

71
00:04:59.930 --> 00:05:00.320
<v 1>Okay.</v>

72
00:05:00.320 --> 00:05:00.890
<v 0>What,</v>

73
00:05:00.890 --> 00:05:05.890
if you can just put yourself back in the mind of that a young Guido 12,

74
00:05:06.891 --> 00:05:08.030
13,
14,

75
00:05:08.780 --> 00:05:13.780
was that grounded in a desire to create a system so to create something or was

76
00:05:14.511 --> 00:05:17.750
it more just tinkering?
Just the joy of puzzle solving?

77
00:05:18.510 --> 00:05:22.230
<v 2>Uh,
I think it was more the latter actually.
I</v>

78
00:05:23.880 --> 00:05:27.510
maybe towards the end of my high school

79
00:05:29.120 --> 00:05:29.690
period,

80
00:05:29.690 --> 00:05:34.690
I felt confident enough that that I designed my own circuits.

81
00:05:35.001 --> 00:05:39.560
Death were sort of interesting
somewhat,

82
00:05:40.650 --> 00:05:45.650
but lots of that time I literally just took a model kit and follow the

83
00:05:47.341 --> 00:05:49.950
instructions,
putting the things together.
I mean that,

84
00:05:50.640 --> 00:05:53.970
I think the first few years that I build electronics kits,

85
00:05:53.971 --> 00:05:58.971
I really did not have enough understanding off sort of electronics to really

86
00:06:00.561 --> 00:06:02.630
understand what I was doing.
I mean,

87
00:06:02.631 --> 00:06:07.430
I could debug it and I could sort of follow the instructions very carefully,

88
00:06:07.960 --> 00:06:10.490
uh,
which has had,
which has always stayed with me,

89
00:06:10.491 --> 00:06:15.491
but I had a very naive model of like how a transistor works.

90
00:06:18.710 --> 00:06:20.020
And I,
I don't think that,

91
00:06:20.060 --> 00:06:25.060
that in those days I had any understanding of coils and capacitors,

92
00:06:26.960 --> 00:06:27.261
which,

93
00:06:27.261 --> 00:06:32.261
which actually sort of was a major problem when I started to build more complex

94
00:06:34.410 --> 00:06:38.190
digital circuits because it was unaware of the,

95
00:06:38.191 --> 00:06:42.930
sort of the analog part of the,
how they actually work.

96
00:06:43.320 --> 00:06:46.290
And I would have things that

97
00:06:48.300 --> 00:06:53.240
the scheme,
the schematic looked every,
everything looked fine and,
uh,

98
00:06:53.280 --> 00:06:54.240
it didn't work.

99
00:06:54.270 --> 00:06:59.270
And what I didn't realize was that there was some megahertz level oscillation

100
00:07:00.811 --> 00:07:05.811
that was throwing the circuit off because I had a sort of two wires were too

101
00:07:05.881 --> 00:07:09.900
close or the switches were,
uh,

102
00:07:10.830 --> 00:07:12.420
we're kind of poorly built.

103
00:07:13.080 --> 00:07:15.180
<v 0>But through that time,</v>

104
00:07:16.040 --> 00:07:16.670
<v 3>okay.</v>

105
00:07:16.670 --> 00:07:19.640
<v 0>I think it's really interesting and instructive to think about because it has</v>

106
00:07:19.820 --> 00:07:23.690
echoes of it are in this time now.
So in the 1970s,

107
00:07:23.691 --> 00:07:25.400
the personal computer was being born.

108
00:07:27.490 --> 00:07:31.060
So did you sense in tinkering with these circuits?

109
00:07:31.090 --> 00:07:35.170
Did you sense the encroaching revolution and personal computing?

110
00:07:35.350 --> 00:07:37.890
So if at that point you're sick,
what,

111
00:07:38.020 --> 00:07:42.820
we'll sit you down and ask you to predict the eighties in the nineties do you

112
00:07:42.821 --> 00:07:47.821
think you'd be able to do so successfully to unroll this,

113
00:07:48.030 --> 00:07:48.863
the process?

114
00:07:49.780 --> 00:07:52.780
<v 2>No,
I,
I had no clue.
I,</v>

115
00:07:53.860 --> 00:07:58.120
I remember I think in the summer after my senior year,

116
00:07:58.930 --> 00:08:03.700
or maybe it was the summer after my junior year.
Well,
at some point,

117
00:08:03.701 --> 00:08:08.701
I think when I was 18 I went on a trip to the math Olympiad in eastern Europe

118
00:08:12.310 --> 00:08:13.660
and there was like,

119
00:08:13.661 --> 00:08:18.661
I was part of the Dutch team and there were other nerdy kits that sort of had

120
00:08:19.211 --> 00:08:24.040
different experiences and one of them told me about this amazing thing called a

121
00:08:24.041 --> 00:08:27.400
computer and I had never heard that word.

122
00:08:28.270 --> 00:08:31.390
My own explorations in electronics.

123
00:08:31.900 --> 00:08:36.900
We're sort of about very simple digital circuits and I,

124
00:08:38.080 --> 00:08:39.250
I had sort of,

125
00:08:39.340 --> 00:08:44.340
I had the idea that I somewhat understood how a digital calculator worked and so

126
00:08:46.181 --> 00:08:51.010
there is maybe some echoes of computers dare,

127
00:08:51.011 --> 00:08:53.560
but I didn't,
didn't,
I never made that connection.

128
00:08:53.561 --> 00:08:58.561
I didn't know that when my parents were paying for magazine subscriptions using

129
00:09:00.511 --> 00:09:05.260
punched cards,
that there was something called a computer that was involved with,

130
00:09:05.261 --> 00:09:08.250
would read those cards and transferred money between accounts.

131
00:09:08.251 --> 00:09:12.210
I was also not really interested in those things.

132
00:09:12.480 --> 00:09:17.480
It was only when I went to university to study math that I've found out that

133
00:09:20.010 --> 00:09:23.400
they had a computer and students were allowed to use it

134
00:09:23.660 --> 00:09:24.493
<v 0>and there was some,</v>

135
00:09:24.590 --> 00:09:29.540
you're supposed to talk to that computer by programming it or did that feel
like,

136
00:09:30.010 --> 00:09:32.200
<v 2>yeah,
that was the only thing you could do with it,</v>

137
00:09:32.640 --> 00:09:36.610
that the computer wasn't really connected to the real world.

138
00:09:36.640 --> 00:09:39.460
The only thing you could do us sort of,

139
00:09:39.520 --> 00:09:43.150
you typed your program on a bunch of punched cards,

140
00:09:43.690 --> 00:09:46.750
you gave the punched cards,
do the operator,

141
00:09:47.080 --> 00:09:52.080
and an hour later the operator gave you back your printout and so all you could

142
00:09:53.381 --> 00:09:58.381
do was write a program that did something very abstract and I don't even

143
00:10:00.941 --> 00:10:04.720
remember what my first forays into programming were,
but

144
00:10:06.940 --> 00:10:11.940
there were sort of doing simple math exercises and just to learn how a

145
00:10:13.001 --> 00:10:14.500
programming language worked.

146
00:10:15.440 --> 00:10:17.940
<v 0>Did you sense,
okay,</v>

147
00:10:17.941 --> 00:10:20.900
first year of college you see this computer,
you're,

148
00:10:21.100 --> 00:10:23.580
you're able to have a program in the,
generate some output.

149
00:10:24.330 --> 00:10:29.330
Did you start seeing the possibility of this or was it a continuation of the

150
00:10:31.051 --> 00:10:35.490
tinkering with circuits?
Did,
did you start to imagine that one,

151
00:10:35.491 --> 00:10:39.670
the personal computer,
but did you see it as something that,
is it

152
00:10:39.770 --> 00:10:42.440
<v 2>tool,
they've got tools like awards</v>

153
00:10:42.540 --> 00:10:45.240
<v 0>processing tool maybe,
maybe for gaming or something?</v>

154
00:10:45.630 --> 00:10:48.090
Or did you start to imagine that it could be,
you know,

155
00:10:48.091 --> 00:10:51.450
going to the world of robotics?
Like you've,
you know,

156
00:10:51.451 --> 00:10:55.110
the Frankenstein picture that you could create an artificial being,

157
00:10:55.230 --> 00:10:59.150
there's like another entity in front of you.
You did not stay,
I

158
00:10:59.470 --> 00:11:02.540
<v 2>don't think I really saw it that way.</v>

159
00:11:02.541 --> 00:11:05.660
I was really more interested in the tinkering.
It's,

160
00:11:05.670 --> 00:11:10.670
it's maybe not as sort of a complete coincidence that I ended up sort of

161
00:11:13.790 --> 00:11:17.720
creating a programming language,
which is a tool for other programmers.

162
00:11:17.780 --> 00:11:22.780
I've always been very focused on the sort of activity of programming itself and

163
00:11:22.791 --> 00:11:26.060
not so much what happens with,

164
00:11:27.110 --> 00:11:32.000
with the program.
You right,
right.
I do remember,

165
00:11:32.001 --> 00:11:36.140
and I don't,
maybe in my second or third year,

166
00:11:36.710 --> 00:11:38.360
probably my second actually,

167
00:11:39.380 --> 00:11:44.330
someone pointed out to me that there was this thing called Conway's game of

168
00:11:44.331 --> 00:11:48.200
life.
Uh,
you're probably familiar with it.

169
00:11:49.190 --> 00:11:52.820
Uh,
I think the 70s,
I think he came up with it.

170
00:11:53.020 --> 00:11:58.020
So there was a scientific American column by someone who did a monthly column

171
00:12:00.611 --> 00:12:05.590
about mathematical diversions and also blinking out on the guy's name.
It was,

172
00:12:05.591 --> 00:12:09.430
it was very famous at the time and I think up to the 90s or so,

173
00:12:10.060 --> 00:12:13.750
and one of his columns was about Conway's game of life and he had some

174
00:12:13.751 --> 00:12:18.580
illustrations and he wrote down all the rules and sort of if there was the

175
00:12:18.581 --> 00:12:23.581
suggestion that this was philosophically interesting that that was why Conway

176
00:12:23.621 --> 00:12:24.730
had called it that.

177
00:12:26.350 --> 00:12:30.610
And all I had was like the two pages photocopy of that article.

178
00:12:31.240 --> 00:12:34.700
I don't even remember where he got it.
Uh,

179
00:12:34.750 --> 00:12:37.900
but it spoke to me and I remember implementing

180
00:12:39.480 --> 00:12:41.370
a version of that game

181
00:12:42.780 --> 00:12:47.700
for the batch computer we were using where I had hope,

182
00:12:47.701 --> 00:12:52.650
has cal program that sort of read an initial situation from input and read some

183
00:12:52.651 --> 00:12:57.651
numbers that that said do so many generations and print every so many

184
00:12:59.521 --> 00:13:00.570
generations.

185
00:13:00.600 --> 00:13:05.600
And then out would come pages and pages of off sort of things as of different

186
00:13:09.061 --> 00:13:12.870
kinds.
And I remember much later,

187
00:13:13.290 --> 00:13:15.540
I've done a similar thing using python,

188
00:13:15.541 --> 00:13:20.541
but I'd sort of debt original version I wrote at the time I found interesting

189
00:13:22.291 --> 00:13:27.291
because I combined it with some trick I had learned during my electronics

190
00:13:29.101 --> 00:13:33.180
hobbyist times.
I essentially,
first on paper,

191
00:13:33.181 --> 00:13:38.181
I designed a simple circuit built out of logic gates that took nine bits of

192
00:13:42.030 --> 00:13:42.601
input,

193
00:13:42.601 --> 00:13:47.601
which is the sort of the cell and its neighbors and produced a new value for

194
00:13:49.801 --> 00:13:53.340
that cell.
And it's like a combination of,

195
00:13:53.341 --> 00:13:57.870
of a half adder and some other clipping,
you know,
it's actually a full adder.

196
00:13:58.920 --> 00:14:03.920
And so I had worked that out and then I translated that into a series of Boolean

197
00:14:06.870 --> 00:14:11.870
operations on Pascal integers where you could use the integers as bitwise,

198
00:14:13.970 --> 00:14:15.210
uh,
values.

199
00:14:15.750 --> 00:14:20.750
And so I could basically generate 60 bits of a generation in,

200
00:14:23.990 --> 00:14:25.140
uh,
in like

201
00:14:27.070 --> 00:14:30.760
eight instructions are so nice.
So I was proud of that.

202
00:14:32.110 --> 00:14:35.500
It's funny that you mentioned.
So,
uh,
for people who don't know,

203
00:14:35.501 --> 00:14:39.610
Conway's game of life has a,
there's,
it's a cellular Automata,

204
00:14:39.611 --> 00:14:44.611
whether it's single compute units that kind of look at their neighbors and uh,

205
00:14:45.400 --> 00:14:49.990
figure out what they look like in the next generation based on the state of

206
00:14:49.991 --> 00:14:52.280
their neighbors.
And this deeply distributed

207
00:14:52.670 --> 00:14:56.450
<v 0>a system in,
in concept at least.</v>

208
00:14:56.750 --> 00:15:01.160
And then there's simple rules that all of them follow.

209
00:15:01.430 --> 00:15:06.200
And somehow out of the simple rule,
when you step back and look at what occurs,

210
00:15:06.530 --> 00:15:10.310
uh,
it's,
it's beautiful.
There's a,

211
00:15:10.311 --> 00:15:13.850
an emergent complexity,
even though the underlying rules are simple.

212
00:15:13.851 --> 00:15:15.170
There's an emergent complexity.

213
00:15:15.620 --> 00:15:18.320
Now the funny thing is you've implemented this and the thing that you're

214
00:15:18.321 --> 00:15:23.321
commenting on is you're proud of a hack you did to make it run efficiently when

215
00:15:25.611 --> 00:15:30.440
you're not commenting on like,
this is a beautiful implementation.
Uh,

216
00:15:30.590 --> 00:15:34.760
you're not commenting on the fact that there's an emerging complexity that

217
00:15:34.761 --> 00:15:35.870
you've,
you've,

218
00:15:35.930 --> 00:15:39.900
you've quoted a simple program and when you step back and you print out the

219
00:15:40.260 --> 00:15:42.320
following generation after generation,

220
00:15:42.710 --> 00:15:47.390
that's stuff that you may have not predicted would happen,
is happening.
Right?

221
00:15:48.190 --> 00:15:49.970
And then there was this is that magic.

222
00:15:50.510 --> 00:15:53.480
That's the magic that all of us feel when we program.
When you,

223
00:15:53.481 --> 00:15:58.481
when you create a program and then you run it and whether it's hello world or a

224
00:15:58.701 --> 00:16:01.070
show,
something on screen,
if there's a graphical component,

225
00:16:01.370 --> 00:16:04.790
are you seeing the magic in the mechanism of creating that?

226
00:16:05.170 --> 00:16:09.250
<v 2>I think I went back and forth,
uh,
as a student,</v>

227
00:16:09.251 --> 00:16:13.750
we had an incredibly small budget,
uh,

228
00:16:13.770 --> 00:16:17.500
of computer time that we could use.
It was actually measured.

229
00:16:17.530 --> 00:16:22.150
I once got in trouble with one of my professors because I had overspent the

230
00:16:22.151 --> 00:16:26.050
department's budget.
It's a different story,
but so

231
00:16:28.080 --> 00:16:28.913
<v 0>aye.</v>

232
00:16:29.680 --> 00:16:34.680
<v 2>I actually wanted the efficient implementation because I also wanted to explore</v>

233
00:16:36.430 --> 00:16:41.430
what would happen with a larger number of generations and a larger sort of size

234
00:16:43.451 --> 00:16:47.290
of the,
of the board.
And so once the,

235
00:16:47.560 --> 00:16:51.160
the implementation was flawless,
uh,

236
00:16:52.030 --> 00:16:56.500
I would feed a different patterns.
And then I think maybe there was a,

237
00:16:56.560 --> 00:17:00.340
a followup article where there were patterns that debt,

238
00:17:00.341 --> 00:17:02.920
we're like gliders,
patterns,

239
00:17:02.921 --> 00:17:07.870
depth repeated themselves after a number of generations,
but,

240
00:17:08.410 --> 00:17:09.100
uh,

241
00:17:09.100 --> 00:17:14.100
translated one or two positions to the right or up or something like that.

242
00:17:15.840 --> 00:17:20.560
Uh,
and there were,
I remember things like glider guns while you can,

243
00:17:20.590 --> 00:17:23.290
you can Google Conway's game of life if there's still,

244
00:17:24.070 --> 00:17:27.040
people still go on who over it

245
00:17:27.390 --> 00:17:31.890
<v 0>for a reason because it's not really well understood why,
I mean,</v>

246
00:17:31.891 --> 00:17:35.500
this is what Stephen Wolfram is obsessed about.
Uh,

247
00:17:35.770 --> 00:17:37.590
he's just the,
the,

248
00:17:37.620 --> 00:17:40.860
we don't have the mathematical tools to describe the kind of complexity that

249
00:17:40.861 --> 00:17:45.180
emerges in these kinds of systems.
And the only way you can do is to run it.

250
00:17:47.120 --> 00:17:52.120
<v 2>I'm not convinced that that it's sort of a problem that lends itself to classic</v>

251
00:17:54.811 --> 00:17:56.430
mathematical analysis.

252
00:17:56.740 --> 00:17:59.710
<v 0>No.
And,
uh,
so one,</v>

253
00:17:59.711 --> 00:18:04.711
one theory of how you create an artificial intelligence or artificial being as

254
00:18:04.841 --> 00:18:07.630
you kind of have to,
same with the game of life.

255
00:18:07.660 --> 00:18:10.690
You kind of have to create a universe and let it run,

256
00:18:11.530 --> 00:18:15.760
that creating it from scratch in a design way in the,
you know,

257
00:18:15.940 --> 00:18:18.510
coding up a python program that creates,
uh,

258
00:18:19.010 --> 00:18:22.480
a full intelligence system may be quite challenging that you might need to

259
00:18:22.481 --> 00:18:24.870
create a universe just like the game of life has.

260
00:18:26.660 --> 00:18:26.991
<v 2>Well,</v>

261
00:18:26.991 --> 00:18:31.991
you might have to experiment with a lot of different universes before there is a

262
00:18:32.961 --> 00:18:37.961
set of rules that doesn't essentially always just end up repeating itself in a,

263
00:18:40.701 --> 00:18:41.750
in a trivial way.

264
00:18:42.430 --> 00:18:43.320
<v 0>Yeah.
And,
and uh,</v>

265
00:18:43.600 --> 00:18:47.740
Steve Wolf from Stephen Wolfman works with these simple rules,

266
00:18:47.950 --> 00:18:51.940
says that it's kind of surprising how quickly you find rules that create

267
00:18:51.941 --> 00:18:55.900
interesting things you shouldn't be able to,
but somehow you do.

268
00:18:56.500 --> 00:19:00.160
And so maybe our universe is laden with,
uh,

269
00:19:00.161 --> 00:19:03.370
with rules that will create interesting things.
They might not look like humans,

270
00:19:03.371 --> 00:19:04.930
but you know,

271
00:19:04.990 --> 00:19:08.500
emerging phenomena that's interesting may not be as difficult to create as we

272
00:19:08.501 --> 00:19:13.270
think.
Sure.
But let me sort of ask at that time,
you know,

273
00:19:13.271 --> 00:19:16.750
some of the world,
at least in popular press,
uh,

274
00:19:17.200 --> 00:19:22.200
was kind of captivated perhaps at least in America by the idea of artificial

275
00:19:22.931 --> 00:19:24.430
intelligence that,

276
00:19:25.150 --> 00:19:28.660
that these computers would be able to think pretty soon.

277
00:19:29.470 --> 00:19:31.450
And that to you at all,

278
00:19:31.451 --> 00:19:36.400
did that in science fiction or in reality in any way.

279
00:19:37.160 --> 00:19:37.760
<v 3>Okay.</v>

280
00:19:37.760 --> 00:19:42.760
<v 2>I didn't really start reading science fiction until much,</v>

281
00:19:42.771 --> 00:19:43.640
much later.

282
00:19:46.750 --> 00:19:48.460
I think as a teenager,
I,

283
00:19:49.060 --> 00:19:52.960
I read maybe one bundle of science fiction stories.

284
00:19:54.390 --> 00:19:57.180
<v 0>Was it in the background somewhere?
Like in your thoughts?</v>

285
00:19:57.270 --> 00:19:57.780
<v 2>Yeah,</v>

286
00:19:57.780 --> 00:20:02.780
that's sort of the using computers to build something intelligent always fell to

287
00:20:04.001 --> 00:20:05.170
me because I had,

288
00:20:05.440 --> 00:20:10.440
I felt I had so much understanding of what actually goes on inside a computer.

289
00:20:11.710 --> 00:20:12.543
I,

290
00:20:12.670 --> 00:20:17.560
I knew how many bits of memory it had and how difficult it was to program and

291
00:20:18.940 --> 00:20:19.773
sort of,

292
00:20:21.940 --> 00:20:24.190
I didn't believe at all that,

293
00:20:24.250 --> 00:20:29.250
that you could just build something intelligent out of doubt,

294
00:20:29.470 --> 00:20:34.470
that that would really sort of satisfy my definition of intelligence.

295
00:20:37.121 --> 00:20:41.660
They think the most,
the most influential thing that I read,
uh,

296
00:20:42.610 --> 00:20:47.110
in my early twenties was Godel Escher Bach.
That was about,

297
00:20:48.010 --> 00:20:52.120
<v 5>and that was a big eye opener in,
in some sense.</v>

298
00:20:53.650 --> 00:20:58.600
<v 0>In what sense?
So,
so,
so yeah.
So on your own brain,
did you use,</v>

299
00:20:58.630 --> 00:21:02.930
did you at the time or do you now see your own brain is a computer or is it

300
00:21:03.220 --> 00:21:06.550
because they're a total separation of the way?
So yeah,

301
00:21:06.551 --> 00:21:10.720
you're very pragmatically practically know the limits of memory,

302
00:21:11.200 --> 00:21:16.200
the limits of this sequential computing or weekly paralyzed computing and you

303
00:21:16.481 --> 00:21:20.380
just know what we have now and it's hard to see how it creates,

304
00:21:20.770 --> 00:21:25.240
but it's also easy to see.
It wasn't in the forties,
50s,

305
00:21:25.241 --> 00:21:30.241
60s and now at least similarities between the brain and in our computers.

306
00:21:31.680 --> 00:21:32.820
<v 5>Oh yeah.
I mean,
I,</v>

307
00:21:34.140 --> 00:21:39.140
I totally believe that brains are computers in some sense.

308
00:21:41.340 --> 00:21:42.173
I mean,

309
00:21:42.690 --> 00:21:47.690
the rules they use to play by are pretty different from the rules we,

310
00:21:47.840 --> 00:21:52.440
we can sort of implement in,
in our current hardware.

311
00:21:53.370 --> 00:21:56.550
But I don't believe in

312
00:21:58.110 --> 00:22:03.110
like a separate thing that infuses us with intelligence or

313
00:22:06.190 --> 00:22:09.350
consciousness and or any of that.
There's no soul.
I've,

314
00:22:09.360 --> 00:22:14.360
I've been an atheist probably from when I was 10 years old just by thinking a

315
00:22:16.951 --> 00:22:21.090
bit about math and the universe and then,
well my parents were atheists.

316
00:22:22.190 --> 00:22:25.090
Uh,
now I know that you,
you,

317
00:22:25.130 --> 00:22:29.910
you could be an atheist and still believe that there is something sort of

318
00:22:31.410 --> 00:22:36.410
about intelligence or consciousness that cannot possibly emerge from a fixed set

319
00:22:37.501 --> 00:22:40.020
of rules.
I am not in that camp.

320
00:22:40.620 --> 00:22:42.810
I totally see that

321
00:22:44.430 --> 00:22:49.430
sort of given how many millions of years evolution took its time.

322
00:22:50.850 --> 00:22:55.650
DNA is,
is a particular machine that that sort of

323
00:22:56.960 --> 00:22:57.540
<v 4>yeah,</v>

324
00:22:57.540 --> 00:23:02.540
<v 5>and codes information and an unlimited amount of information in,</v>

325
00:23:04.170 --> 00:23:09.170
in chemical a form and has figured out a way to replicate itself.

326
00:23:12.340 --> 00:23:15.790
I thought that death was,
maybe it's 300 million years ago,

327
00:23:15.791 --> 00:23:19.180
but I thought it was closer to half a minute,
half a billion years ago.

328
00:23:19.181 --> 00:23:24.181
That that's sort of originated and it hasn't really changed that the sort of,

329
00:23:25.781 --> 00:23:29.140
the structure of DNA hasn't changed ever since.
That is like

330
00:23:30.970 --> 00:23:34.780
are binary code that we have in hardware.
I mean

331
00:23:35.160 --> 00:23:37.320
<v 0>the basic programming language hasn't changed,</v>

332
00:23:37.590 --> 00:23:40.380
but maybe the programming itself

333
00:23:40.510 --> 00:23:43.240
<v 5>of his lead ditch did sort of it,</v>

334
00:23:43.450 --> 00:23:46.160
it happened to be a set of rules that was good

335
00:23:46.160 --> 00:23:47.000
<v 2>enough to,</v>

336
00:23:48.080 --> 00:23:53.080
to sort of develop endless variability and and sort of the,

337
00:23:55.970 --> 00:24:00.970
the idea of self replicating molecules competing with each other for resources

338
00:24:02.001 --> 00:24:05.960
and one tight eventually sort of always taking over.

339
00:24:07.040 --> 00:24:11.450
That's happened before there were any fossils so we don't know how that's

340
00:24:11.451 --> 00:24:15.840
exactly happened but
I believe it,
it's,

341
00:24:15.890 --> 00:24:18.020
it's clear that that did happen.
And

342
00:24:19.070 --> 00:24:23.030
<v 0>can you comment on consciousness and how yous see it?</v>

343
00:24:23.510 --> 00:24:27.590
Because I think we'll talk about programming quite a bit.
We'll talk about,

344
00:24:27.830 --> 00:24:31.340
you know,
intelligence connecting to programming fundamentally,

345
00:24:31.341 --> 00:24:35.240
but the consciousness consciousness is this whole lot of other thing.

346
00:24:35.840 --> 00:24:40.400
Do you think about it often as a developer of a programming language

347
00:24:40.860 --> 00:24:45.150
<v 2>and,
and as a human,
those,</v>

348
00:24:45.210 --> 00:24:49.980
those are pretty sort of separate topics?
My sort of,

349
00:24:50.460 --> 00:24:55.460
my line of work working with programming does not involve anything that that

350
00:24:58.311 --> 00:25:02.030
goes in the direction of developing intelligence or consciousness.

351
00:25:02.390 --> 00:25:07.390
But sort of privately as an avid reader of popular science writing,

352
00:25:12.090 --> 00:25:14.320
I I have some thoughts which,

353
00:25:14.350 --> 00:25:19.350
which is mostly that I don't actually believe that consciousness is an all or

354
00:25:22.781 --> 00:25:27.670
nothing thing.
I have a feeling that,

355
00:25:27.730 --> 00:25:32.620
and I forget what I read that influenced this,
but

356
00:25:35.260 --> 00:25:38.320
I feel that if you look at a cat or a dog or a mouse,

357
00:25:38.350 --> 00:25:40.900
they have some form of intelligence.

358
00:25:41.170 --> 00:25:46.170
If you look at a fish it has some form of intelligence and

359
00:25:51.080 --> 00:25:55.060
that evolution just took a long time.
But I feel that the,

360
00:25:55.061 --> 00:26:00.061
the sort of evolution of more and more intelligence that led to,

361
00:26:00.641 --> 00:26:05.641
to sort of the human form of intelligence followed the evolution of

362
00:26:08.570 --> 00:26:13.340
does census,
especially the visual sense.

363
00:26:14.510 --> 00:26:19.510
I mean there is an enormous amount of processing that's needed to interpret a

364
00:26:20.601 --> 00:26:25.601
scene and humans are still better at that then then computers are,

365
00:26:26.660 --> 00:26:28.060
yeah.
And so and,
and,

366
00:26:28.080 --> 00:26:33.080
and I have a feeling that there is a sort of

367
00:26:34.760 --> 00:26:35.520
<v 4>okay</v>

368
00:26:35.520 --> 00:26:40.520
<v 2>dare the reason that that like mammals is in particular developed the levels of</v>

369
00:26:43.470 --> 00:26:48.210
that they have and then eventually read sort of into from going from

370
00:26:48.211 --> 00:26:53.211
intelligence to to self awareness and consciousness has to do with sort of being

371
00:26:54.511 --> 00:26:58.410
a robot that has very highly developed census

372
00:26:58.790 --> 00:27:02.670
<v 0>as a lot of rich sensory information coming in.
So the,</v>

373
00:27:03.210 --> 00:27:05.640
that's a really interesting thought that the,

374
00:27:07.280 --> 00:27:09.780
that whatever that basic mechanism of DNA,

375
00:27:10.050 --> 00:27:14.130
whatever that basic building blocks of programming is you,

376
00:27:14.131 --> 00:27:18.100
if you just add more abilities,
more,
more uh,

377
00:27:18.120 --> 00:27:20.220
high resolution sensors,
more sensors,

378
00:27:20.670 --> 00:27:25.080
you just keep stacking those things on top that this basic programming in trying

379
00:27:25.081 --> 00:27:30.081
to survive develops very interesting things that start to us humans to appear

380
00:27:30.601 --> 00:27:32.310
like intelligence and consciousness.

381
00:27:32.680 --> 00:27:36.430
<v 2>Yeah.
So in,
in,
in,
as far as robots go,</v>

382
00:27:36.431 --> 00:27:39.670
I think that the self driving cars have the sort of,

383
00:27:40.720 --> 00:27:41.410
<v 4>yeah,</v>

384
00:27:41.410 --> 00:27:45.850
<v 2>the greatest opportunity of developing something like that because</v>

385
00:27:46.900 --> 00:27:47.400
<v 4>okay.</v>

386
00:27:47.400 --> 00:27:48.870
<v 2>When I drive myself,</v>

387
00:27:48.900 --> 00:27:52.530
I don't just pay attention to the rules of the road.

388
00:27:53.370 --> 00:27:53.800
<v 4>Okay.</v>

389
00:27:53.800 --> 00:27:58.660
<v 2>I also look around and I get clues from that.
Oh,
this is a shopping district.</v>

390
00:28:00.450 --> 00:28:03.960
Oh,
here's an old lady crossing the street.
Oh,

391
00:28:03.961 --> 00:28:08.700
here is someone carrying a pile of mail.

392
00:28:08.730 --> 00:28:10.150
There's a mailbox at that shit.

393
00:28:10.160 --> 00:28:13.560
They're gonna cross the street to reach that mailbox.

394
00:28:13.890 --> 00:28:18.240
And I slowed down and I don't even think about that.
Yeah.
And,
and so there is,

395
00:28:18.260 --> 00:28:23.260
there is so much where you turn your observations into an understanding of what

396
00:28:25.800 --> 00:28:30.800
other consciousnesses are going to do or what other systems in the world are

397
00:28:32.431 --> 00:28:35.490
going to be.
Oh,
that two he is gonna fall.

398
00:28:37.430 --> 00:28:39.630
Yeah.
I see sort of,

399
00:28:39.980 --> 00:28:42.810
I see much more of a,

400
00:28:42.900 --> 00:28:47.460
I expect somehow that if anything is going to become conscious,

401
00:28:47.461 --> 00:28:52.461
it's going to be the self driving car and not the network of a bazillion

402
00:28:54.210 --> 00:28:59.210
computers at in a Google or Amazon data center that are all network together to

403
00:29:00.631 --> 00:29:03.420
uh,
to do whatever they do.

404
00:29:04.470 --> 00:29:07.340
<v 0>So in that sense,
so you actually highlight,</v>

405
00:29:07.380 --> 00:29:09.600
cause that's what I work in autonomous vehicles.

406
00:29:09.601 --> 00:29:14.601
You highlight big gap between what we currently can't do and what we truly need

407
00:29:15.691 --> 00:29:19.500
to be able to do to solve the problem under that formulation.

408
00:29:19.501 --> 00:29:24.501
Then consciousness and intelligence is something that basically a system should

409
00:29:25.681 --> 00:29:30.681
have in order to interact with us humans as opposed to some kind of abstract

410
00:29:30.691 --> 00:29:34.770
notion of,
of uh,
uh,
consciousness.

411
00:29:34.771 --> 00:29:38.310
Consciousness is something that you need to have to be able to empathize,

412
00:29:38.580 --> 00:29:42.370
to be able to,
um,
fear the,

413
00:29:42.371 --> 00:29:44.680
understand what the fear of death is.

414
00:29:45.040 --> 00:29:48.610
All these aspects that are important for interacting with pedestrians need to be

415
00:29:48.611 --> 00:29:53.611
able to do basic computation based on our human desires and thoughts.

416
00:29:57.270 --> 00:30:02.190
<v 2>Sort of.
Yeah.
If you,
if you look at the dog,
the dog clearly knows.
I mean,</v>

417
00:30:02.191 --> 00:30:05.100
I'm not the dog out under my belt.
I have friends who have dogs.

418
00:30:05.101 --> 00:30:09.120
The dogs clearly know what the humans around them are going to do,

419
00:30:09.121 --> 00:30:12.260
or at least they have a model of what those humans are going to do.

420
00:30:12.261 --> 00:30:13.950
And they learn the dog.

421
00:30:13.980 --> 00:30:18.300
Some dogs know when you're going out and they want to go out with you.

422
00:30:18.301 --> 00:30:21.990
They are sad when you leave alone,
they cry.
Uh,

423
00:30:22.390 --> 00:30:26.490
they're afraid because they were mistreated when they were younger.

424
00:30:27.330 --> 00:30:30.910
Uh,
we,

425
00:30:30.940 --> 00:30:35.940
we don't assign sort of consciousness to dogs or at least not,

426
00:30:36.110 --> 00:30:37.160
not all that much,

427
00:30:37.161 --> 00:30:41.630
but I also don't think they have none of that.

428
00:30:42.350 --> 00:30:43.350
So I think it's,

429
00:30:43.380 --> 00:30:48.380
it's consciousness and intelligence are not all or nothing.

430
00:30:50.290 --> 00:30:54.790
<v 0>The spectrum,
it's really interesting.
But in returning to,</v>

431
00:30:55.690 --> 00:30:56.030
<v 2>yeah,</v>

432
00:30:56.030 --> 00:30:59.780
<v 0>programming languages and the way we think about building these kinds of things</v>

433
00:30:59.870 --> 00:31:03.800
about building intelligence,
building consciousness,
building artificial beings.

434
00:31:04.240 --> 00:31:09.230
So I think one of the exciting ideas came in the 17th century and with a

435
00:31:09.231 --> 00:31:14.231
lightness hubs to cart where there's this feeling that you can convert all

436
00:31:15.891 --> 00:31:17.270
thought,
all reasoning,

437
00:31:18.230 --> 00:31:23.230
all the thing that we find very special in our brains.

438
00:31:23.241 --> 00:31:27.140
You can convert all of that into logic so you can formalize it,

439
00:31:27.260 --> 00:31:31.100
former reasoning and then once you formalize everything,
all of knowledge,

440
00:31:31.340 --> 00:31:34.700
then you can just calculate and that's what we're doing with our brains is we're

441
00:31:34.701 --> 00:31:37.550
calculating.
So there's this whole idea that we,

442
00:31:38.550 --> 00:31:40.210
that this is possible that this one,

443
00:31:40.320 --> 00:31:45.320
<v 2>if you weren't aware of the concept of pattern matching in the sense that we are</v>

444
00:31:46.141 --> 00:31:49.320
aware of it now a day,
sort of thought you,

445
00:31:50.230 --> 00:31:55.230
they had this covered incredible bits of mathematics like newtons,

446
00:31:55.890 --> 00:32:00.890
calculus and dare sort of idealism,

447
00:32:01.140 --> 00:32:01.860
dare,

448
00:32:01.860 --> 00:32:06.860
dare sort of extension of what they could do with logic and math sort of went

449
00:32:09.751 --> 00:32:13.440
along those lines and they fought

450
00:32:14.860 --> 00:32:17.740
Doris Doris like yeah,
logic.
There's,

451
00:32:17.770 --> 00:32:21.790
there's like a bunch of rules and a bunch of input.

452
00:32:21.820 --> 00:32:26.820
They didn't realize that how you recognize a face is not just a bunch of rules,

453
00:32:28.241 --> 00:32:31.920
but is there a shit ton of data plus,
uh,

454
00:32:32.440 --> 00:32:37.440
a circuit that that sort of interprets the visual clues and the context and

455
00:32:39.561 --> 00:32:44.561
everything else and somehow can massively parallel pattern match against stored

456
00:32:48.621 --> 00:32:49.820
rules.
I mean,

457
00:32:50.600 --> 00:32:54.890
but if I see you tomorrow here in front of the Dropbox offers,

458
00:32:54.950 --> 00:32:59.240
I might recognize you even if I'm wearing a different shirt.
Yeah.
But if I,

459
00:32:59.241 --> 00:33:02.090
if I see you tomorrow in a coffee shop in Belmont,

460
00:33:02.120 --> 00:33:05.570
I might have no idea that it was you or on the beach or whatever.

461
00:33:05.690 --> 00:33:09.380
And I make those kind of mistakes myself all the time.

462
00:33:10.250 --> 00:33:13.430
I see someone that I only know as like,
oh,

463
00:33:13.431 --> 00:33:15.710
this person is a colleague of my wife's.
Yeah.

464
00:33:16.010 --> 00:33:18.080
And then I see them at the movies and

465
00:33:18.720 --> 00:33:23.640
<v 0>I don't recognize them.
But do you see those,
you call it pattern matching.</v>

466
00:33:24.240 --> 00:33:28.200
Do you see that rules is,
uh,

467
00:33:28.950 --> 00:33:32.450
unable to encode that to you?
Everything.

468
00:33:32.460 --> 00:33:35.610
You see all the pieces of information.
You look around this room,

469
00:33:35.611 --> 00:33:38.820
I'm wearing a black shirt.
I have a certain height.
I'm a human.

470
00:33:38.821 --> 00:33:42.270
All of these you can,
there's probably tens of thousands of facts.

471
00:33:42.271 --> 00:33:45.360
You pick up moment by moment about this scene.

472
00:33:45.600 --> 00:33:47.340
You take them for granted and you accumulate,

473
00:33:47.730 --> 00:33:49.680
aggregate them together to understand the scene.

474
00:33:49.890 --> 00:33:52.860
You don't think all of that could be encoded to where at the end of the day you

475
00:33:52.861 --> 00:33:57.010
can just put it all on the table and calculate,
oh,

476
00:33:57.500 --> 00:34:01.130
<v 2>I don't even know what that means.
I mean,
yes,</v>

477
00:34:01.131 --> 00:34:04.280
in the sense that there is no there,

478
00:34:04.281 --> 00:34:06.680
there is no actual magic dare,

479
00:34:06.710 --> 00:34:11.710
but there are enough layers of abstraction from sort of from the facts as they

480
00:34:13.461 --> 00:34:18.461
enter my eyes and my ears to the understanding of the scene that that I don't

481
00:34:19.431 --> 00:34:24.431
think that that AI has really covered enough of,

482
00:34:24.900 --> 00:34:25.733
of,

483
00:34:26.810 --> 00:34:27.360
<v 3>yeah.</v>

484
00:34:27.360 --> 00:34:28.740
<v 2>Of that distance.</v>

485
00:34:29.010 --> 00:34:34.010
It's like if you take a human body and you realize it's built out of Adam's well

486
00:34:35.941 --> 00:34:40.710
that that is a uselessly reductionist view.

487
00:34:40.770 --> 00:34:45.390
Right?
Right.
The body is built out of organs.
The organs are built out of cells.

488
00:34:45.391 --> 00:34:47.490
The cells are built out of proteins.

489
00:34:47.491 --> 00:34:51.660
The proteins are built out of amino acids.

490
00:34:51.690 --> 00:34:56.400
The amino acids are built out of Adams and then you go to quantum mechanics.

491
00:34:57.900 --> 00:34:59.910
<v 0>So that's a very pragmatic view.</v>

492
00:34:59.911 --> 00:35:03.240
I mean obviously as an engineer I agree with that kind of view,
but I also,

493
00:35:03.270 --> 00:35:06.190
you also have to consider the,
the,

494
00:35:06.480 --> 00:35:08.610
the Sam Harris view of,

495
00:35:08.730 --> 00:35:13.620
well we'll intelligence is just information processing these,
just like you said,

496
00:35:13.621 --> 00:35:14.970
you take in sensory information,

497
00:35:14.971 --> 00:35:18.840
he do some stuff with it and you come up with actions that are intelligent,

498
00:35:20.660 --> 00:35:23.780
<v 2>that make,
he makes it sound so easy.
I don't know who Sam Harris is.</v>

499
00:35:24.040 --> 00:35:28.530
<v 0>Uh Oh.
Uh Oh,
it's philosopher.
So like this how philosophers often think,
right?</v>

500
00:35:28.960 --> 00:35:33.720
Essentially that's what the car,
it was,
wait a minute.
If there is,
like you said,

501
00:35:33.721 --> 00:35:34.590
no magic.

502
00:35:35.700 --> 00:35:38.910
So you basically says it doesn't appear like there's any magic,

503
00:35:38.940 --> 00:35:43.530
but we know so little about it that it might as well be magic.

504
00:35:44.100 --> 00:35:44.670
So Jay,

505
00:35:44.670 --> 00:35:47.970
just because we know that we're made of atoms just because we know we're made of

506
00:35:47.971 --> 00:35:52.380
Oregon's the fact that we know very little hot to get from the Adams to organs

507
00:35:53.010 --> 00:35:58.010
in a way that's three creatable means it that you shouldn't get too excited just

508
00:35:58.951 --> 00:36:02.190
yet about the fact that he figured out that we're made of atoms.

509
00:36:02.330 --> 00:36:03.590
<v 2>Right.
And,
and,</v>

510
00:36:03.680 --> 00:36:08.680
and the same about taking facts as are our sensory organs.

511
00:36:09.201 --> 00:36:14.201
Take them in and turning that into reasons and the actions that sort of Darryl,

512
00:36:17.811 --> 00:36:22.811
lots of abstractions that we haven't quite figured out how to,

513
00:36:22.880 --> 00:36:24.710
how to deal with those.
I mean,
I,

514
00:36:27.040 --> 00:36:32.040
so sometimes I didn't know if I can go on a tangent or not to lose a drag you

515
00:36:33.231 --> 00:36:34.640
back in.
Sure.

516
00:36:34.760 --> 00:36:39.140
So if I take a simple program that parses,

517
00:36:39.170 --> 00:36:43.490
uh,
say,
say I have a compiler,
it parses the program.

518
00:36:44.300 --> 00:36:45.021
In a sense,

519
00:36:45.021 --> 00:36:50.021
the input routine of that compiler of the parser is a sense a sensing Oregon and

520
00:36:53.511 --> 00:36:58.511
it builds up a mighty complicated internal representation of the program had

521
00:36:58.911 --> 00:36:59.570
just saw.

522
00:36:59.570 --> 00:37:04.570
It doesn't just have a linear sequence of bytes representing the text of the

523
00:37:05.781 --> 00:37:06.740
program anymore.

524
00:37:06.741 --> 00:37:11.741
It has an abstract syntax tree and I didn't know how many of your viewers or

525
00:37:12.921 --> 00:37:16.850
listeners are familiar with compiler technology,

526
00:37:16.851 --> 00:37:20.720
but there is fewer and fewer these days.
All right.
Uh,

527
00:37:21.590 --> 00:37:26.090
that's also true.
Probably people want to take a shortcut,

528
00:37:26.120 --> 00:37:31.120
but there is sort of this abstraction is a data structure that's the compiler

529
00:37:31.581 --> 00:37:35.840
then uses to produce outputs that is relevant,

530
00:37:35.870 --> 00:37:40.820
like a translation of the program to machine code that can be executed by by

531
00:37:40.821 --> 00:37:41.654
hardware

532
00:37:45.400 --> 00:37:50.400
and then the data structure gets thrown away when a fish or a fly sees sort of

533
00:37:55.481 --> 00:37:57.610
gets visual impulses.

534
00:37:58.990 --> 00:38:03.990
I'm sure it also builds up some data structure and for the fly that may be very

535
00:38:05.681 --> 00:38:09.640
minimal.
A fly may may have only a few.

536
00:38:09.940 --> 00:38:14.530
I mean in the case of a fly's brain,
I could imagine that there are

537
00:38:15.600 --> 00:38:16.030
<v 3>okay</v>

538
00:38:16.030 --> 00:38:21.030
<v 2>few enough layers of abstraction that it's not much more than when it's darker</v>

539
00:38:22.481 --> 00:38:24.130
here than it is here.
Well,

540
00:38:24.131 --> 00:38:29.131
I can sense motion because of fly sort of response when you move your arm

541
00:38:29.171 --> 00:38:29.771
towards it.

542
00:38:29.771 --> 00:38:34.771
So clearly it's visual processing is intelligent or not intelligent,

543
00:38:36.491 --> 00:38:41.491
but it has in an abstraction for emotion and we still have similar things in in

544
00:38:43.730 --> 00:38:46.420
but much more complicated in our brains.

545
00:38:46.421 --> 00:38:50.440
I mean otherwise you couldn't drive a car if you couldn't if you didn't have an

546
00:38:50.441 --> 00:38:53.020
incredibly good abstraction for motion.

547
00:38:54.670 --> 00:38:58.990
<v 0>Yeah.
In some sense the same attraction for motion is probably one of the primary</v>

548
00:38:59.170 --> 00:39:04.120
sources of our,
of information for us.
We just know what to do.

549
00:39:04.300 --> 00:39:08.050
I think we know what to do with that.
We've built up other obstructions on top

550
00:39:08.610 --> 00:39:13.610
<v 2>much more complicated data structures based on that and we build more persistent</v>

551
00:39:14.161 --> 00:39:17.340
data structures sort of after some processing.

552
00:39:17.341 --> 00:39:22.341
Some information sort of gets stored in our memory pretty much permanently and

553
00:39:23.021 --> 00:39:27.990
and is available on the recall.
I mean there are some things that you sort of,

554
00:39:29.460 --> 00:39:31.710
you're conscious that you're remembering it.

555
00:39:31.740 --> 00:39:35.790
Like you give me your phone number a,
well,

556
00:39:36.030 --> 00:39:38.370
at my age I have to write it down,
but I could imagine,

557
00:39:38.371 --> 00:39:41.160
I could remember those seven numbers are 10,

558
00:39:41.250 --> 00:39:46.250
10 digits and reproduce them in a while if I sort of repeat them to myself a few

559
00:39:47.161 --> 00:39:49.200
times.
Uh,

560
00:39:49.890 --> 00:39:54.180
so that's a fairly conscious form of memorization.
On the other hand,

561
00:39:54.360 --> 00:39:56.970
how do I recognize your face?
I have no idea.

562
00:39:57.630 --> 00:40:02.630
My brain has a whole bunch of specialized hardware that knows how to recognize

563
00:40:03.601 --> 00:40:04.051
faces.

564
00:40:04.051 --> 00:40:09.051
I don't know how much of that is sort of coded in our DNA and how much of that

565
00:40:10.020 --> 00:40:14.040
is trained over and over between the ages of zero and three,

566
00:40:15.600 --> 00:40:16.320
but,
but,

567
00:40:16.320 --> 00:40:21.120
but somehow our brains know how to do lots of things like that,

568
00:40:21.150 --> 00:40:25.800
that are useful in our interactions with,
with other humans,
with,

569
00:40:25.830 --> 00:40:28.250
without really being conscious

570
00:40:28.300 --> 00:40:32.800
<v 0>just of how it's done anymore.
Right?
So,
so what our actual day to day lives,</v>

571
00:40:32.801 --> 00:40:36.610
we're operating at the very highest level of abstraction where we're just not

572
00:40:36.611 --> 00:40:38.950
even conscious of all the little details underlying it.

573
00:40:39.580 --> 00:40:43.420
There's compilers on top of sec turtles on top of turtles or turtles all the way

574
00:40:43.421 --> 00:40:47.620
down.
It's composite all the way down.
But that's essentially,

575
00:40:47.621 --> 00:40:50.890
you say that there's no magic.
That's what I,

576
00:40:51.630 --> 00:40:55.810
what I was trying to get at I think is with Deckard started this whole train of

577
00:40:55.811 --> 00:40:59.560
saying that there's no magic.
I mean there's all this before.

578
00:41:00.360 --> 00:41:05.360
<v 2>Also have the notion though that the soul and the body where we're fundamentally</v>

579
00:41:06.190 --> 00:41:06.881
<v 0>separate.
Yeah.</v>

580
00:41:06.881 --> 00:41:11.590
I think he had to write in God in there for political reasons.
So I don't,

581
00:41:11.591 --> 00:41:13.810
I don't actually,
I'm not historian.
Uh,

582
00:41:13.840 --> 00:41:17.710
but there's notions in there that all of reasoning,

583
00:41:17.740 --> 00:41:19.840
all of human thought can be formalized.

584
00:41:20.150 --> 00:41:24.460
I think that continued in the 20th century with,

585
00:41:24.600 --> 00:41:28.990
with the Russell and with,
uh,
with Gail's,
uh,
incompleteness Theorem,

586
00:41:29.220 --> 00:41:30.720
this debate of what,
what,

587
00:41:30.721 --> 00:41:32.920
what are the limits of the things that could be formalized.

588
00:41:32.921 --> 00:41:37.140
That's the Turing machine came along and this is exciting idea.
I mean,

589
00:41:37.190 --> 00:41:41.810
underlying a lot of computing that you can do quite a lot with a computer.

590
00:41:42.590 --> 00:41:43.010
You can,

591
00:41:43.010 --> 00:41:47.000
you can encode a lot of the stuff we're talking about in terms of recognizing

592
00:41:47.001 --> 00:41:47.930
faces and so on.

593
00:41:48.110 --> 00:41:52.550
Theoretically in an algorithm that can then run on a computer.

594
00:41:53.630 --> 00:41:58.630
And in that context I like to ask programming in a philosophical way.

595
00:42:02.550 --> 00:42:04.860
<v 2>So what,
so what is what,
what is it</v>

596
00:42:04.880 --> 00:42:06.320
<v 0>mean to program a computer?</v>

597
00:42:06.350 --> 00:42:11.350
So he said you write a python program or a compiled c plus plus programming that

598
00:42:12.051 --> 00:42:14.060
compiles to some bike code.

599
00:42:15.500 --> 00:42:18.170
It's forming layers.
You're,
you're,

600
00:42:18.200 --> 00:42:20.660
you're programming a layer of abstraction that's higher.

601
00:42:21.050 --> 00:42:24.080
How do you see programming in that context?

602
00:42:24.710 --> 00:42:27.980
Can it keep getting higher and higher levels of abstraction?

603
00:42:29.790 --> 00:42:30.860
<v 2>I think in a span of,</v>

604
00:42:30.870 --> 00:42:35.220
at some point the higher level of levels of obstruction will not be called

605
00:42:35.221 --> 00:42:40.221
programming and they will not resemble what we,

606
00:42:41.730 --> 00:42:46.470
we call programming at the moment.
There will not be source code.

607
00:42:46.530 --> 00:42:51.530
I mean there will still be source code sort of adds a lower level of the machine

608
00:42:53.701 --> 00:42:58.250
just like they're still molecules and electrons and,

609
00:42:58.251 --> 00:43:01.560
and sort of proteins in our brains.

610
00:43:02.580 --> 00:43:07.580
But and,
and so there are still programming and,
and,

611
00:43:07.581 --> 00:43:09.150
and system administration.

612
00:43:09.151 --> 00:43:12.150
And who knows what's keeping to keep the machine running.

613
00:43:12.570 --> 00:43:17.460
But what the machine does is,
is a different level of abstraction in a sense.

614
00:43:17.490 --> 00:43:22.490
And as far as they understand the way that for last decade or more people have

615
00:43:24.121 --> 00:43:29.121
made progress with things like facial recognition or the self driving cars is

616
00:43:29.851 --> 00:43:33.460
all by endless endless amounts of training data where

617
00:43:35.920 --> 00:43:40.920
at least as as as a lay person and I feel myself totally as a lay person in that

618
00:43:42.281 --> 00:43:44.440
field it looks like.

619
00:43:45.690 --> 00:43:46.470
<v 4>Yeah,</v>

620
00:43:46.470 --> 00:43:51.470
<v 2>the researchers who published the results don't necessarily know exactly how,</v>

621
00:43:53.610 --> 00:43:55.530
how their algorithms work and

622
00:43:56.700 --> 00:43:57.430
<v 4>okay.</v>

623
00:43:57.430 --> 00:44:02.430
<v 2>I often get upset when I sort of read a sort of a fluff piece about Facebook in</v>

624
00:44:04.211 --> 00:44:09.050
the newspaper or social networks and they say,
well,
algorithms and it,

625
00:44:09.060 --> 00:44:14.060
that's like a totally different interpretation of the word algorithm.

626
00:44:14.310 --> 00:44:15.850
Yeah.
Because for me,

627
00:44:16.810 --> 00:44:21.120
the way I was trained or what I learned when I was eight or 10 years old,

628
00:44:21.121 --> 00:44:26.121
and an algorithm is a set of rules that you completely understand that can be

629
00:44:26.351 --> 00:44:30.640
mathematically analyzed and,
and,
and you can prove things.

630
00:44:30.641 --> 00:44:35.641
You can proof that Eris Dasani Civ produces all prime numbers and only prime

631
00:44:37.591 --> 00:44:38.424
numbers.

632
00:44:39.180 --> 00:44:43.650
<v 0>Yeah.
So the,
I don't know if you know who capacity is,
I'm afraid not.</v>

633
00:44:44.220 --> 00:44:48.660
So he's a head of AI at Tesla now,

634
00:44:48.900 --> 00:44:53.900
but he was at Stanford before and he has this cheeky way of calling this concept

635
00:44:54.391 --> 00:44:59.020
software 2.0 to,
let me disentangle that for a second.
So,

636
00:44:59.820 --> 00:45:03.810
so kind of what you're referring to as the traditional traditional,

637
00:45:04.330 --> 00:45:08.340
the algorithm,
the concept of an algorithm is something that's there.
It's clear,

638
00:45:08.341 --> 00:45:09.540
you can read it,
you understand it,

639
00:45:09.541 --> 00:45:14.541
you can prove it's functioning as kind of software 1.0 and what software 2.0 is

640
00:45:17.220 --> 00:45:21.870
is exactly what you described,
which is you have neural networks,

641
00:45:21.871 --> 00:45:26.040
which is a type of machine learning that you feed a bunch of data and that

642
00:45:26.041 --> 00:45:28.950
neural network learns to do a function.

643
00:45:30.060 --> 00:45:34.680
All you specifies the inputs and the outputs you want and you can't look inside,

644
00:45:35.130 --> 00:45:36.300
you can't analyze it.

645
00:45:36.840 --> 00:45:40.620
All you can do is train his function to map the inputs,

646
00:45:40.621 --> 00:45:42.510
the outputs by giving a lot of data.

647
00:45:42.720 --> 00:45:45.870
And that sense programming becomes getting a lot of cleaning,

648
00:45:45.960 --> 00:45:49.800
getting a lot of data.
That's what programming is a in as well.

649
00:45:49.801 --> 00:45:52.920
That would be programming 2.0 2.02 programming 2.0

650
00:45:53.470 --> 00:45:57.280
<v 2>I wouldn't call it that.
Programming it,
it's just a different activity.</v>

651
00:45:57.281 --> 00:46:01.720
Just like building organs out of cells is not called chemistry.

652
00:46:03.430 --> 00:46:05.590
<v 0>Well,
so let's just,
uh,</v>

653
00:46:05.690 --> 00:46:09.190
let's just step back and think sort of more generally.
I've of course,

654
00:46:09.460 --> 00:46:14.140
but you know,
it's like,
uh,
as a parent teaching,

655
00:46:14.380 --> 00:46:19.380
teaching your kids things can be called programming in that same sense that

656
00:46:20.411 --> 00:46:23.890
that's hot program has been used.
You providing them data,

657
00:46:23.891 --> 00:46:26.650
examples use cases.

658
00:46:26.980 --> 00:46:31.570
So imagine writing a function not by,
uh,

659
00:46:31.600 --> 00:46:36.570
not with four loops and uh,
clearly readable text,

660
00:46:36.571 --> 00:46:38.230
but more saying,
well,

661
00:46:38.260 --> 00:46:42.160
here's a lot of examples of what this function should take.

662
00:46:42.340 --> 00:46:45.880
And here's a lot of examples of when it takes those functions.

663
00:46:45.940 --> 00:46:49.090
It should do this and then figuring out the rest.

664
00:46:50.140 --> 00:46:52.450
So that's 2.0 concept.

665
00:46:52.540 --> 00:46:57.540
And the question I have for you usually it's like it's a very fuzzy way.

666
00:46:58.450 --> 00:47:01.150
This is the reality of a lot of these pattern recognition systems.

667
00:47:01.151 --> 00:47:04.390
And so it's a fuzzy way of quote unquote programming.

668
00:47:05.260 --> 00:47:08.910
What do you think about this kind of world?
Uh,
it should,
it,

669
00:47:08.911 --> 00:47:12.720
should it be called something totally different than a programming?

670
00:47:12.880 --> 00:47:15.160
It's like if you're a software engineer,

671
00:47:16.960 --> 00:47:20.920
does that mean you're,
you're designing systems that are very,

672
00:47:20.921 --> 00:47:24.490
can be systematically tested,
evaluated,

673
00:47:24.491 --> 00:47:29.491
they have a very specific specification and then this other fuzzy 2.0 world

674
00:47:30.491 --> 00:47:33.100
machine learning world.
That's something else.
Totally.

675
00:47:33.400 --> 00:47:36.160
Or is there some intermixing that it's possible?

676
00:47:40.740 --> 00:47:44.640
<v 5>Well,
the question is probably only being as,</v>

677
00:47:44.670 --> 00:47:49.670
because we don't quite know what that software 2.0 actually is and it sort of a

678
00:47:53.611 --> 00:47:58.611
think there is a truism that every task that AI has has tackled in the past.

679
00:48:02.130 --> 00:48:06.660
At some point we realized how it was done and then it was no longer considered

680
00:48:07.290 --> 00:48:12.290
part of artificial intelligence because it was no longer necessary to,

681
00:48:13.620 --> 00:48:17.250
to use that term.
It was just,
Oh,

682
00:48:17.251 --> 00:48:19.620
now we know how to do this.

683
00:48:20.910 --> 00:48:25.910
And a new field of science or engineering has been developed and I don't know if

684
00:48:30.030 --> 00:48:35.030
sort of every form of learning or sort of controlling computer systems should

685
00:48:37.561 --> 00:48:40.260
always be called programming.
So I did,
I don't know,

686
00:48:40.261 --> 00:48:45.000
maybe I'm focused too much on the terminology I,
but I expect that

687
00:48:47.800 --> 00:48:48.151
debt,

688
00:48:48.151 --> 00:48:53.151
there just will be different concepts where people with sort of different

689
00:48:56.231 --> 00:49:01.231
education and a different model of what they're trying to do.

690
00:49:02.890 --> 00:49:07.350
Uh,
will,
we'll develop those concepts.
Yeah.

691
00:49:07.930 --> 00:49:10.030
<v 0>I guess if you could comment,</v>

692
00:49:10.630 --> 00:49:15.220
and another way to put this concept is I think,

693
00:49:16.600 --> 00:49:21.600
I think the kind of functions that neural networks provide is things as opposed

694
00:49:21.821 --> 00:49:26.680
to being able to upfront prove that this should work for all cases.

695
00:49:26.681 --> 00:49:29.320
You throw at it all,
you're able,

696
00:49:29.321 --> 00:49:32.200
it's the worst case analysis versus average case analysis.

697
00:49:32.201 --> 00:49:34.550
All you able to say is it's,

698
00:49:34.810 --> 00:49:39.460
it seems and everything we've tested to work 99.9% of the time,

699
00:49:39.640 --> 00:49:41.230
but we can't guarantee it and it,

700
00:49:42.220 --> 00:49:45.970
it fails in unexpected ways or give me me give you examples of how it fails in

701
00:49:45.971 --> 00:49:50.740
unexpected ways,
but it's like really good most of the time.
Yeah.

702
00:49:50.770 --> 00:49:55.300
But there no room for that in current ways.
We think about programming.

703
00:49:56.320 --> 00:49:56.790
<v 4>Yeah.</v>

704
00:49:56.790 --> 00:49:57.623
<v 5>Uh,</v>

705
00:49:59.270 --> 00:50:00.103
<v 4>yeah.</v>

706
00:50:00.280 --> 00:50:03.940
<v 5>Programming 1.0 is actually sort of</v>

707
00:50:06.220 --> 00:50:11.220
getting to that point to where there's sort of the ideal of a bug free program

708
00:50:15.430 --> 00:50:19.960
has been abandoned long ago by most software developers.

709
00:50:20.890 --> 00:50:25.890
We only care about bugs that manifest themselves often enough,

710
00:50:27.560 --> 00:50:32.560
be annoying and we're willing to take the occasional crash or outage or

711
00:50:35.090 --> 00:50:36.410
incorrect result,

712
00:50:37.590 --> 00:50:38.423
<v 1>uh,</v>

713
00:50:39.410 --> 00:50:42.740
<v 5>for granted because we can't possibly,</v>

714
00:50:43.400 --> 00:50:47.750
we don't have enough programmers to make all the code book free.

715
00:50:47.751 --> 00:50:50.150
And it would be an incredibly tedious business.

716
00:50:50.151 --> 00:50:53.450
And if you try to throw formal methods added,
it gets,

717
00:50:53.480 --> 00:50:55.520
it becomes even more tedious.

718
00:50:56.090 --> 00:51:01.090
So every once in a while the user clicks on a link in and somehow they get an

719
00:51:04.070 --> 00:51:07.280
error and the average user doesn't panic.

720
00:51:07.281 --> 00:51:12.281
They just click again and see if it works better the second time,

721
00:51:13.581 --> 00:51:15.770
which often magically it does.

722
00:51:16.340 --> 00:51:21.340
Or they go up and they try some other way of performing their tasks.

723
00:51:21.521 --> 00:51:26.521
So that's sort of an end to end recovery mechanism and inside systems there is

724
00:51:29.751 --> 00:51:34.751
all sorts of retries and timeouts and fallbacks.

725
00:51:36.590 --> 00:51:41.590
And I imagine that that sort of biological systems are even more full of that

726
00:51:41.631 --> 00:51:43.640
because otherwise they wouldn't survive.

727
00:51:46.170 --> 00:51:51.170
<v 0>Do you think programming should be taught and thought of as exactly what you</v>

728
00:51:52.201 --> 00:51:56.040
just said?
I come from is kind of um,

729
00:51:57.580 --> 00:52:00.090
you're,
you're almost denying that fact always

730
00:52:00.920 --> 00:52:05.920
<v 5>in insertive basic programming education,</v>

731
00:52:08.590 --> 00:52:10.900
there's sort of the programs you're,

732
00:52:11.650 --> 00:52:15.760
you're having students write are so small and simple

733
00:52:16.870 --> 00:52:17.710
<v 1>debt.</v>

734
00:52:19.180 --> 00:52:20.170
<v 5>If there is a bug,</v>

735
00:52:20.200 --> 00:52:25.200
you can always find it and fix it because the sort of programming as it's being

736
00:52:25.721 --> 00:52:30.721
taught in some even elementary middle schools in highschool introduction to

737
00:52:32.951 --> 00:52:37.510
programming classes in college,
typically it's programming in the small,

738
00:52:38.500 --> 00:52:43.500
very few classes sort of actually teach software engineering,

739
00:52:43.991 --> 00:52:45.700
building large systems.
I mean

740
00:52:47.350 --> 00:52:51.130
every summer here at Dropbox we have a large number of interns.

741
00:52:51.131 --> 00:52:55.510
Every tech company in on the West Coast has the same thing.

742
00:52:56.440 --> 00:53:01.440
These interns are always amazed because this is the first time in their life

743
00:53:02.291 --> 00:53:07.291
that they see what goes on in a really large software development environment

744
00:53:10.540 --> 00:53:15.540
and everything they've learned in college was almost always about a much smaller

745
00:53:19.451 --> 00:53:24.451
scale and somehow that difference in scale makes a qualitative in how you,

746
00:53:26.190 --> 00:53:28.800
<v 2>how you do things and how you think about it.</v>

747
00:53:29.490 --> 00:53:33.270
<v 0>If you then take a few steps back into decades,</v>

748
00:53:34.020 --> 00:53:38.160
70s and 80s when you were first thinking about python or just that world of

749
00:53:38.161 --> 00:53:40.010
programming languages,
the,

750
00:53:40.110 --> 00:53:44.520
did you ever think that there would be systems as large as underlying Google,

751
00:53:44.521 --> 00:53:47.370
Facebook and Dropbox?
Did you,

752
00:53:47.910 --> 00:53:51.300
when you were thinking about python,

753
00:53:51.510 --> 00:53:56.190
<v 2>I was actually always caught by surprise by every state.
Yeah.</v>

754
00:53:56.220 --> 00:53:58.470
Pretty much every stage of computing.

755
00:53:59.570 --> 00:54:03.290
<v 0>So maybe just because,
um,</v>

756
00:54:03.590 --> 00:54:05.240
you spoken in other interviews,

757
00:54:05.241 --> 00:54:08.600
but I think the evolution of programming languages are fascinating.

758
00:54:08.760 --> 00:54:13.760
It's especially because it leads from my perspective towards greater and greater

759
00:54:13.851 --> 00:54:15.110
degrees of intelligence.

760
00:54:15.190 --> 00:54:19.910
I learned the first programming language I played with in,
in Russia was,

761
00:54:19.911 --> 00:54:24.900
um,
well the turtle logo logo.
Yeah.
And,

762
00:54:25.400 --> 00:54:28.550
uh,
and,
and if you look,
I just have a list of programming languages,

763
00:54:28.551 --> 00:54:31.320
all of which have no have played with a little bit.
I mean,

764
00:54:31.321 --> 00:54:34.940
they're all beautiful in different ways from Fortran,
cobol,
Lisp,

765
00:54:35.060 --> 00:54:38.660
Algol 60 basic logo.
Again,
see,

766
00:54:39.290 --> 00:54:42.140
um,
as a few,
uh,

767
00:54:42.141 --> 00:54:47.030
the object oriented came along in the 60s.
Simula Pascal,
small talk,

768
00:54:47.420 --> 00:54:51.950
all of that leaves the classics.
The classics.
Yeah.
The classic hits,
Right.
Uh,

769
00:54:52.310 --> 00:54:56.000
scheme built that's built on top of the list

770
00:54:58.160 --> 00:55:02.480
on the database side,
SQL c plus plus,
and all of that leads up to Python,

771
00:55:02.900 --> 00:55:07.610
Pascal to,
that's before python and Matlab,

772
00:55:08.090 --> 00:55:10.670
these kinds of different communities,
different languages.

773
00:55:10.850 --> 00:55:13.280
So can you talk about that world?

774
00:55:13.281 --> 00:55:16.640
I know that I'm sort of python came out of ABC,

775
00:55:16.641 --> 00:55:19.130
which actually never knew that language.
I just,

776
00:55:19.430 --> 00:55:23.600
I haven't researched this conversation.
Went Back to ABC and it looks remarkably,

777
00:55:23.900 --> 00:55:26.540
it,
it has a lot of annoying qualities,

778
00:55:27.290 --> 00:55:30.560
but underneath those like all caps and so on.
Uh,

779
00:55:30.561 --> 00:55:34.010
but underneath that there's elements of python that are quite,

780
00:55:34.110 --> 00:55:38.360
they're already there.
I got all the good stuff,
all the good stuff.
So,

781
00:55:38.361 --> 00:55:39.410
but in that world,

782
00:55:39.411 --> 00:55:42.680
you're swimming these programming languages where you focused on just the good

783
00:55:42.681 --> 00:55:46.940
stuff in your specific circle or did you have a sense of what,

784
00:55:47.420 --> 00:55:49.400
what does everyone chasing?
You said,
um,

785
00:55:49.820 --> 00:55:54.140
that every programming language is built to scratch an itch.

786
00:55:56.830 --> 00:56:01.040
Were you aware of all the itches in the community and if not,

787
00:56:01.041 --> 00:56:05.060
or if yes.
I mean,
what we trying to scratch with python?

788
00:56:05.780 --> 00:56:05.961
<v 2>Well,</v>

789
00:56:05.961 --> 00:56:10.961
I'm glad I wasn't aware of all the itches because I would probably not have been

790
00:56:11.781 --> 00:56:14.450
able to do anything.
I mean,

791
00:56:14.451 --> 00:56:18.980
if you're trying to solve every problem at once and you'll saw nothing,

792
00:56:19.760 --> 00:56:23.500
well yeah.
And it's,
it's too overwhelming.
Yeah.

793
00:56:23.650 --> 00:56:28.360
And so I had a very,
very focused problem.

794
00:56:28.390 --> 00:56:30.930
I wanted a programming language that sets,

795
00:56:31.950 --> 00:56:32.480
<v 1>yeah,</v>

796
00:56:32.480 --> 00:56:36.770
<v 2>somewhere in between Shell scripting and see</v>

797
00:56:38.570 --> 00:56:40.640
<v 1>and no,</v>

798
00:56:41.790 --> 00:56:45.750
<v 2>arguably dairies like one is higher level,</v>

799
00:56:45.751 --> 00:56:46.890
one is lower level

800
00:56:48.290 --> 00:56:49.123
<v 1>and</v>

801
00:56:49.770 --> 00:56:54.730
<v 2>by film is sort of a language of an intermediate level,</v>

802
00:56:54.731 --> 00:56:58.150
although it's still pretty much at the high level.
And

803
00:57:00.610 --> 00:57:04.270
I was,
I was thinking about much more about

804
00:57:06.290 --> 00:57:11.290
I want a tool that I can use to be more productive as a programmer in a very

805
00:57:12.921 --> 00:57:16.020
specific environment.
Uh,

806
00:57:16.070 --> 00:57:21.070
and I also had given myself a time budget for the development of the tool and

807
00:57:22.311 --> 00:57:27.311
that was sort of about three months for both the design,

808
00:57:27.711 --> 00:57:32.210
like thinking through what are all the features of the language syntactically

809
00:57:33.800 --> 00:57:38.800
and semantically and how do I implement the whole pipeline from parsing the

810
00:57:41.151 --> 00:57:43.070
source code to executing it.

811
00:57:43.550 --> 00:57:48.550
<v 0>So I think both with the timeline and the goals,</v>

812
00:57:49.340 --> 00:57:53.300
it seems like productivity was at the core of it,
that as a goal.

813
00:57:53.900 --> 00:57:58.270
So like for me,
in the 90s and a,

814
00:57:58.271 --> 00:58:02.120
the first decade of the 21st century,
I was always doing machine learning.

815
00:58:02.150 --> 00:58:06.590
Ai Programming for my research was always in c plus plus.

816
00:58:07.170 --> 00:58:08.060
Wow.
And then,

817
00:58:09.710 --> 00:58:12.230
and then the other people who are a little more mechanical engineering,

818
00:58:12.231 --> 00:58:16.160
electrical engineering are our mat lobby.
Uh,
the,

819
00:58:16.161 --> 00:58:17.960
that a little bit more mat lab focus,

820
00:58:18.380 --> 00:58:20.980
those are the world them and maybe a little bit Java to,
uh,

821
00:58:21.020 --> 00:58:24.080
but no people who are more interested in.

822
00:58:24.560 --> 00:58:28.190
And I'm emphasizing the object oriented nature of things.

823
00:58:29.030 --> 00:58:32.210
So we'll then in um,
last 10 years or so,

824
00:58:32.330 --> 00:58:36.110
especially with the oncoming of neural networks in these packages are built on

825
00:58:36.111 --> 00:58:40.220
python to interface with,
with the neon that works.

826
00:58:40.370 --> 00:58:42.410
I switched to python and it's just,

827
00:58:43.550 --> 00:58:46.730
I've noticed a significant boost that I can't exactly,

828
00:58:46.731 --> 00:58:47.660
cause I don't think about it,

829
00:58:47.661 --> 00:58:52.040
but I can't exactly put into words why I'm just much,
much more productive.

830
00:58:52.550 --> 00:58:55.520
Just being able to get the job done much,
much faster.

831
00:58:56.180 --> 00:59:00.410
So how do you think whatever that qualitative differences,

832
00:59:00.440 --> 00:59:03.500
I don't know if it's quantitative,
it could be just a feeling.

833
00:59:04.340 --> 00:59:07.970
I don't know if I'm actually more productive,
but how do you think about,

834
00:59:09.530 --> 00:59:11.840
yeah.
Well,
uh,
that,
that's right.

835
00:59:11.841 --> 00:59:15.050
I think there's an elements and they just speak to one aspect that I think those

836
00:59:15.051 --> 00:59:20.051
effects I productivity is plus was was I really enjoyed creating performant code

837
00:59:24.950 --> 00:59:29.000
and creating a beautiful structure where everything that,
you know,

838
00:59:29.120 --> 00:59:31.400
this kind of going into this,
especially with the newer,

839
00:59:31.401 --> 00:59:36.020
newer standards of templated programming,
of just really creating this beautiful,

840
00:59:36.240 --> 00:59:41.240
a formal structure that I found myself spending most of my time doing that as

841
00:59:41.481 --> 00:59:42.314
opposed to getting,

842
00:59:43.300 --> 00:59:46.670
parsing a file and extracting and few keywords or whatever the task was trying

843
00:59:46.671 --> 00:59:47.330
to do.

844
00:59:47.330 --> 00:59:51.860
So what is it about python and how do you think of productivity in general as

845
00:59:51.861 --> 00:59:56.510
you were designing it now sort of through the decades,
last three decades?

846
00:59:56.660 --> 00:59:58.970
What do you think it means to be a productive programmer?

847
00:59:59.690 --> 01:00:00.010
<v 1>Okay.</v>

848
01:00:00.010 --> 01:00:02.100
<v 0>How did you try to design it into language?</v>

849
01:00:03.300 --> 01:00:07.280
<v 5>There are different tasks and as a programmer it's,</v>

850
01:00:07.290 --> 01:00:12.270
it's useful to have different tools available that sort of are suitable for

851
01:00:12.271 --> 01:00:15.570
different tasks,
right?
So I still write c code,

852
01:00:16.290 --> 01:00:20.550
I still write shellcode,
but I write most of my,

853
01:00:20.790 --> 01:00:22.260
my things in python.

854
01:00:23.440 --> 01:00:24.273
<v 1>Uh,</v>

855
01:00:25.400 --> 01:00:27.740
<v 5>why do I still use those other languages?</v>

856
01:00:27.741 --> 01:00:31.160
Because sometimes the task just demands it.

857
01:00:32.420 --> 01:00:34.040
And well,

858
01:00:34.041 --> 01:00:38.660
I would say most of the time the task actually demands a certain language

859
01:00:38.661 --> 01:00:43.661
because the task is not write a program that solves problem x from scratch,

860
01:00:43.761 --> 01:00:48.761
but it's more like fix a bug in existing program acts or add a small feature to

861
01:00:50.271 --> 01:00:52.640
an existing large program.

862
01:00:53.470 --> 01:00:56.930
<v 1>Uh,
but</v>

863
01:00:58.530 --> 01:01:00.330
<v 5>even if,
if you sort of,</v>

864
01:01:01.790 --> 01:01:06.790
if you're not constrained in your choice of language by context like that,

865
01:01:08.860 --> 01:01:09.693
<v 1>uh,</v>

866
01:01:09.950 --> 01:01:14.720
<v 5>dairy is still the fact that if you write it in a certain language,</v>

867
01:01:14.750 --> 01:01:19.130
then you sort of,
you,

868
01:01:19.160 --> 01:01:23.250
you have this balance between how long does it time,

869
01:01:24.150 --> 01:01:29.150
does it take you to write the code and how long does the code run?

870
01:01:30.490 --> 01:01:31.960
<v 1>Right.
And</v>

871
01:01:33.390 --> 01:01:34.920
<v 5>when you're in sort of</v>

872
01:01:36.460 --> 01:01:39.730
in the phase of exploring solutions,

873
01:01:40.630 --> 01:01:44.110
you often spend much more time writing the code done,

874
01:01:44.111 --> 01:01:48.820
running it because every time you've sort of,
you've run it,

875
01:01:49.270 --> 01:01:54.130
you see that the output is not quite what you wanted and you spend some more

876
01:01:54.131 --> 01:01:55.110
time coding.

877
01:01:55.990 --> 01:01:58.600
<v 1>Uh,
and</v>

878
01:01:59.530 --> 01:02:04.530
<v 5>a language like python just makes death iteration much faster because there are</v>

879
01:02:06.431 --> 01:02:10.090
fewer details.
There is a large library,

880
01:02:11.020 --> 01:02:13.540
uh,
sort of there fewer details that,

881
01:02:13.690 --> 01:02:18.690
that you have to get right before your program compiles and runs a,

882
01:02:19.320 --> 01:02:23.430
there are libraries that don't do all sorts of stuff for you so you can sort of

883
01:02:23.431 --> 01:02:28.431
very quickly take a bunch of existing components,

884
01:02:30.030 --> 01:02:32.630
put them together and uh,

885
01:02:32.880 --> 01:02:36.120
get your prototype application running.

886
01:02:36.121 --> 01:02:39.240
Just like when I was building electronics,

887
01:02:39.660 --> 01:02:42.030
I was using a breadboard most of the time.

888
01:02:42.660 --> 01:02:47.660
So I had this like sprawl out circuits that if you shook it,

889
01:02:49.741 --> 01:02:53.580
it would stop working because it was not put together very well,

890
01:02:53.581 --> 01:02:58.581
but it functioned and all I wanted was to see that it worked and then move on to

891
01:02:59.821 --> 01:03:04.290
the next,
next schematic or design or add something to it.

892
01:03:04.710 --> 01:03:06.960
Once you've sort of figured out,
oh,

893
01:03:06.961 --> 01:03:11.640
this is the perfect design for my radio or light sensor or whatever,

894
01:03:12.030 --> 01:03:15.690
then you can say,
okay,
how do we design a PCB for this?

895
01:03:15.691 --> 01:03:19.500
How do we solve it or the components in a small space?

896
01:03:19.770 --> 01:03:23.410
How do we make it so that it is robust against,
uh,

897
01:03:24.570 --> 01:03:29.570
say voltage fluctuations or mechanical,
uh,

898
01:03:30.720 --> 01:03:32.610
disruption?
I mean,

899
01:03:32.820 --> 01:03:36.300
I know nothing about that when it comes to designing electronics,

900
01:03:36.301 --> 01:03:40.020
but I know a lot about that when it comes to to writing code.

901
01:03:40.290 --> 01:03:43.440
<v 0>So the initial initial steps are uh,</v>

902
01:03:43.480 --> 01:03:46.410
the efficient fast and there's not much stuff that gets in the way.

903
01:03:46.411 --> 01:03:49.950
But you're kind of describing,
um,

904
01:03:51.330 --> 01:03:56.130
from a,
like Darwin described the evolution of species,
right?
You're,

905
01:03:56.180 --> 01:04:00.090
you're,
you're observing of what is about true about python.

906
01:04:00.390 --> 01:04:03.180
Now if you take step back,
if the art of,

907
01:04:03.250 --> 01:04:08.250
if the act of creating languages is art and you had three months to do it,

908
01:04:08.970 --> 01:04:10.720
initial stubs,
and

909
01:04:12.480 --> 01:04:14.580
so you just specified a bunch of goals,

910
01:04:14.950 --> 01:04:17.910
sort of things that you observe about python.
Perhaps you had those goals,

911
01:04:17.911 --> 01:04:22.140
but how do you create the rules,
the syntactic structure,
the,

912
01:04:22.260 --> 01:04:25.290
the features that result in those?

913
01:04:25.500 --> 01:04:29.250
So I have in the beginning and they have followup questions about through the

914
01:04:29.251 --> 01:04:30.930
evolution of Python two.

915
01:04:30.960 --> 01:04:35.460
But in the very beginning when you were sitting there creating the lexical

916
01:04:35.461 --> 01:04:36.490
analyzer or whatever,

917
01:04:36.750 --> 01:04:40.050
<v 5>evolution was still a big part of it because</v>

918
01:04:42.240 --> 01:04:45.960
I sort of,
I said to myself,

919
01:04:46.560 --> 01:04:50.430
I don't want to have to design everything from scratch.

920
01:04:50.460 --> 01:04:54.990
I'm going to borrow features from other languages that I like.
Oh,
interesting.

921
01:04:54.991 --> 01:04:58.770
So you basically,
exactly.
You first observe what you like.
Yeah.

922
01:04:58.771 --> 01:05:03.771
And so that's why if you're 17 years old and you want to sort of create a

923
01:05:04.351 --> 01:05:05.370
programming language,

924
01:05:05.371 --> 01:05:10.371
you're not going to be very successful at it because you have no experience with

925
01:05:11.641 --> 01:05:15.390
other languages.
Whereas I was in my,

926
01:05:17.680 --> 01:05:17.980
let's

927
01:05:17.980 --> 01:05:19.240
<v 2>say mid thirties,</v>

928
01:05:20.420 --> 01:05:21.253
<v 1>uh,</v>

929
01:05:21.820 --> 01:05:24.190
<v 2>I hadn't written parsers before,</v>

930
01:05:24.191 --> 01:05:28.900
so I had worked on the implementation of ABC.
I had spent years,

931
01:05:28.901 --> 01:05:33.190
the Baiting,
the design of ABC with its authors.
It's the,

932
01:05:33.390 --> 01:05:35.810
with its designers.
I had nothing to do with the design.

933
01:05:35.811 --> 01:05:40.811
It was designed fully as it was when ended up being implemented when I joined

934
01:05:41.051 --> 01:05:42.760
the team.
But so

935
01:05:44.560 --> 01:05:49.560
you borrow ideas and concepts and very concrete sort of local rules from

936
01:05:51.101 --> 01:05:52.120
different languages,

937
01:05:52.121 --> 01:05:57.121
like the indentation and certain auto syntactic features from ABC.

938
01:05:57.431 --> 01:06:02.431
But I chose to borrow string literals and how numbers work from C and and

939
01:06:06.580 --> 01:06:07.750
various other things.

940
01:06:07.860 --> 01:06:10.440
<v 0>So in then,
if you take that further,</v>

941
01:06:10.441 --> 01:06:13.110
so yet you've had this funny sounding,

942
01:06:13.111 --> 01:06:18.111
but I think surprisingly accurate and or at least practical a title of a

943
01:06:19.410 --> 01:06:21.630
benevolent dictator for life for quite,
you know,

944
01:06:21.660 --> 01:06:25.140
for the last three decades or whatever,
or no,
not the actual title,

945
01:06:25.141 --> 01:06:29.370
but functionally speaking.
Uh,
so you had to make decisions,

946
01:06:30.450 --> 01:06:31.620
design decisions,

947
01:06:34.140 --> 01:06:39.140
can you maybe let's take python to python releasing python three as an example.

948
01:06:41.700 --> 01:06:46.410
It's not backward compatible to python two in,
in ways that a lot of people know.

949
01:06:47.100 --> 01:06:51.230
So what was that deliberation discussion decision like?
Yeah.

950
01:06:51.240 --> 01:06:53.400
What was the psychology of that experience?

951
01:06:54.450 --> 01:06:57.690
Do you regret any aspects of how their experience undergone?

952
01:06:59.480 --> 01:07:03.980
<v 2>Yeah.
So it was a group process really at that point,</v>

953
01:07:04.190 --> 01:07:08.240
even though I was BDFL in nine in name and,

954
01:07:08.241 --> 01:07:12.500
and certainly everybody's sort of respected my,

955
01:07:13.670 --> 01:07:18.670
my position as the creator and the current sort of owner of the language design.

956
01:07:21.860 --> 01:07:25.190
I was looking as everyone else for feedback,

957
01:07:26.360 --> 01:07:28.700
sort of python three.
Dot.
Oh.

958
01:07:28.701 --> 01:07:33.380
In some sense was sparked by author people in the community,

959
01:07:34.280 --> 01:07:35.930
uh,
pointing out,

960
01:07:36.980 --> 01:07:41.980
oh well there are a few issues that sort of bite users over and over.

961
01:07:46.100 --> 01:07:48.080
Can we do something about that?

962
01:07:48.560 --> 01:07:53.560
And for Python three we took a number of those python wards as they were called

963
01:07:55.131 --> 01:07:57.170
at the time.
And we said,

964
01:07:57.171 --> 01:08:02.171
can we try to sort of make small changes to the language that addressed those

965
01:08:04.551 --> 01:08:05.384
warts?

966
01:08:05.990 --> 01:08:10.990
And we had sort of in the past we had always taken backwards compatibility very

967
01:08:13.461 --> 01:08:14.300
seriously.

968
01:08:15.200 --> 01:08:20.120
And so many python warts in earlier versions had already been resolved because

969
01:08:20.121 --> 01:08:25.121
they could be resolved while maintaining backwards compatibility or sort of

970
01:08:25.251 --> 01:08:30.251
using the theory gradual path of evolution of the language in a certain area.

971
01:08:31.850 --> 01:08:36.850
And so we were stuck with a number of warts that were widely recognized as

972
01:08:37.881 --> 01:08:40.970
problems,
not like roadblocks,

973
01:08:40.971 --> 01:08:45.920
but nevertheless sort of things that some people trip over.
And you know,
that

974
01:08:47.510 --> 01:08:50.930
that's always the same thing that,
that people trip over when they trip.

975
01:08:51.470 --> 01:08:56.470
And we could not think of a backwards compatible way of resolving those issues,

976
01:08:59.570 --> 01:09:03.380
but it's still an option to not resolve the issues.
Right.
And so,
yes,
for,

977
01:09:03.410 --> 01:09:07.460
for a long time we had sort of resigned ourselves to,
well,
okay,

978
01:09:07.461 --> 01:09:11.720
the language is not going to be perfect in this way.
And that's way in that way.

979
01:09:12.620 --> 01:09:17.180
And we sort of,
certain of these,

980
01:09:17.181 --> 01:09:20.780
I mean there are still plenty of things where you can say,
well that's,

981
01:09:21.440 --> 01:09:26.440
that particular detail is better in Java or in our or in visual basic or

982
01:09:28.280 --> 01:09:29.960
whatever.
Uh,

983
01:09:32.400 --> 01:09:36.360
and we're okay with that because,
well,
we can't easily change it.

984
01:09:36.870 --> 01:09:38.790
Uh,
it's not too bad.

985
01:09:38.791 --> 01:09:43.791
We can do a little bit with user education where we can have a static analyzer

986
01:09:44.731 --> 01:09:48.600
or warnings,
uh,
in,
in the parts or something.

987
01:09:49.200 --> 01:09:51.960
But there were things where we thought,

988
01:09:51.961 --> 01:09:55.470
well these are really problems that are not going away,

989
01:09:55.500 --> 01:09:58.920
Derek getting worse in the future.

990
01:10:00.040 --> 01:10:02.020
Uh,
we should do something right,

991
01:10:02.160 --> 01:10:06.020
<v 0>should do something.
But ultimately there is a decision to be made,
right?
Yes.
So</v>

992
01:10:08.490 --> 01:10:12.600
was that the toughest decision in the history of python yet to make as the

993
01:10:12.840 --> 01:10:16.170
benevolent dictator for life or if not,
what are,

994
01:10:16.171 --> 01:10:18.630
are there maybe even on a smaller scale,

995
01:10:18.660 --> 01:10:21.990
what was the decision where you were really torn up about

996
01:10:22.110 --> 01:10:25.500
<v 2>well,
the toughest decision was probably to resign.</v>

997
01:10:27.010 --> 01:10:29.980
<v 0>All right,
let's go there.
Hold on a second then.
Let me just,</v>

998
01:10:30.320 --> 01:10:33.360
because in the interest of time too,
cause I have a few cool questions for you.

999
01:10:33.361 --> 01:10:37.750
I mean let's touch a really important one because it was quite dramatic and

1000
01:10:37.751 --> 01:10:41.260
beautiful and certain kinds of ways,
uh,
in July this year,

1001
01:10:41.261 --> 01:10:46.150
three months ago you wrote,
now that pep five 72 is done.

1002
01:10:46.480 --> 01:10:50.680
I don't ever want to have to fight so hard for a pap and find that so many

1003
01:10:50.681 --> 01:10:52.300
people despise my decisions.

1004
01:10:52.690 --> 01:10:55.780
I would like to remove myself entirely from the decision process.

1005
01:10:56.260 --> 01:11:01.120
I still be there for awhile as an ordinary core developer and I'll still be

1006
01:11:01.121 --> 01:11:04.570
available to mentor people,
possibly more available,

1007
01:11:05.290 --> 01:11:10.290
but I'm basically giving myself a permanent vacation from being BDFL benevolent

1008
01:11:10.691 --> 01:11:15.270
dictator for life and you all will on your own,
Christophe.

1009
01:11:16.360 --> 01:11:18.630
Just this,
it's a,
it's almost Shakespearean.

1010
01:11:19.680 --> 01:11:23.940
I'm not going to appoint a successor,
so what are you're all going to do?

1011
01:11:24.350 --> 01:11:28.620
Create a democracy.
Anarchy,
a dictatorship,
a federation.

1012
01:11:29.130 --> 01:11:31.470
So that was a very dramatic and beautiful

1013
01:11:33.440 --> 01:11:35.180
a set of statements.
It's almost,

1014
01:11:35.210 --> 01:11:40.210
that's open ended nature called the community to create a future for python is

1015
01:11:40.581 --> 01:11:44.970
this kind of beautiful aspect to it.
Wow.
If so,
what?

1016
01:11:44.971 --> 01:11:46.200
And and dramatic,
you know,

1017
01:11:46.620 --> 01:11:50.010
what was making that decision like what was on your heart,
on your mind?

1018
01:11:50.100 --> 01:11:52.620
Stepping back now a few months later,

1019
01:11:53.890 --> 01:11:55.540
we could take me through your mic.
Okay.

1020
01:11:55.670 --> 01:11:56.261
<v 5>Thank you.
Bless you.</v>

1021
01:11:56.261 --> 01:12:01.261
Liked of writing because it was actually written pretty quickly.

1022
01:12:02.770 --> 01:12:04.960
It was literally something like

1023
01:12:07.100 --> 01:12:12.100
after months and months of going around in circles,

1024
01:12:13.910 --> 01:12:18.910
I had finally approved pep five 72 which I had a big hand in its design,

1025
01:12:22.941 --> 01:12:27.050
although I didn't initiate it originally.

1026
01:12:27.770 --> 01:12:32.770
I sort of gave you the bunch of nudges in a direction that would be better for

1027
01:12:34.491 --> 01:12:36.610
the language.
So sorry.
So sorry.

1028
01:12:36.620 --> 01:12:40.550
Just to ask as a CIO is no one or no,
no,

1029
01:12:40.551 --> 01:12:44.960
pep five 72 was actually uh,
a small feature,

1030
01:12:44.961 --> 01:12:48.290
which is assignment expressions or assignment expressions.
Okay.

1031
01:12:48.860 --> 01:12:50.390
Debt had been

1032
01:12:51.490 --> 01:12:51.870
<v 4>okay.</v>

1033
01:12:51.870 --> 01:12:56.870
<v 5>I thought there was just a lot of the bay to where a lot of people claimed that</v>

1034
01:12:58.080 --> 01:13:01.410
day knew what was python I can with was not python sick.

1035
01:13:01.440 --> 01:13:05.970
And they knew that this was going to destroy the language.

1036
01:13:05.971 --> 01:13:09.030
This was a violation of pythons,

1037
01:13:09.031 --> 01:13:11.340
most fundamental design philosophy.

1038
01:13:11.341 --> 01:13:16.110
And I thought that was all bullshit because I was in favor of it and I would

1039
01:13:16.111 --> 01:13:19.050
think I know something about pythons design philosophy.

1040
01:13:19.051 --> 01:13:23.430
So I was really tired and also stressed of that thing.

1041
01:13:23.431 --> 01:13:28.431
And literally after sort of announcing I was going to accept it a certain

1042
01:13:30.481 --> 01:13:33.900
Wednesday evening,
I had finally send the email,

1043
01:13:33.930 --> 01:13:38.460
it's accepted now let's just go implement it.
Uh,

1044
01:13:38.760 --> 01:13:43.760
so I went to bed feeling really relieved that's behind me and I wake up Thursday

1045
01:13:45.960 --> 01:13:48.930
morning,
7:00 AM and I think,

1046
01:13:50.520 --> 01:13:55.470
well that was the last one
that's going to be such,

1047
01:13:56.700 --> 01:14:00.150
such a terrible debate and that's a going to be,

1048
01:14:00.690 --> 01:14:05.690
that's the last time that I let myself be so stressed out about a pep decision.

1049
01:14:05.850 --> 01:14:07.920
Yeah.
I should just resign.

1050
01:14:07.950 --> 01:14:12.550
I've been sort of thinking about retirement for half a decade.

1051
01:14:12.610 --> 01:14:17.610
I've been joking and sort of mentioning retirement,

1052
01:14:19.150 --> 01:14:24.040
sort of telling the community some point in the future I'm going to retire.

1053
01:14:24.300 --> 01:14:28.660
Yeah.
Don't take the F l a part of my title too literally.

1054
01:14:29.260 --> 01:14:34.030
And I thought,
okay,
this is it.
I'm done.
A uh,

1055
01:14:34.810 --> 01:14:38.560
had the day off.
I wanted to have a good time with my wife.

1056
01:14:38.561 --> 01:14:42.400
We were going to a little beach town nearby,
uh,

1057
01:14:42.490 --> 01:14:46.810
and in he think maybe 15,
20 minutes,

1058
01:14:47.380 --> 01:14:49.990
I wrote that thing dead.
You just called Shakespearian.

1059
01:14:50.360 --> 01:14:54.190
And the funny thing is I get so much crap for calling your Shakespeare.

1060
01:14:55.780 --> 01:15:00.780
I didn't even realize what a monumental decision it was because five minutes

1061
01:15:02.411 --> 01:15:07.411
later I read that a link to my message back on Twitter where people were already

1062
01:15:09.731 --> 01:15:13.480
discussing on Twitter,
Guido resigned as the BDFL

1063
01:15:15.130 --> 01:15:15.850
and I had,

1064
01:15:15.850 --> 01:15:20.850
I had posted it on an internal forum that I thought was only read by core

1065
01:15:21.131 --> 01:15:21.964
developers.

1066
01:15:22.330 --> 01:15:26.620
So I thought I would at least have one day before news would sort of get out

1067
01:15:28.420 --> 01:15:32.620
<v 0>the on your own aspect.
I had also an element of quite,</v>

1068
01:15:34.030 --> 01:15:38.230
it was quite a powerful element of the uncertainty that lies ahead.

1069
01:15:39.070 --> 01:15:41.680
But can you also just briefly talk about,

1070
01:15:42.100 --> 01:15:47.100
you know like for example I played guitar as a hobby for fun and whenever I play

1071
01:15:47.321 --> 01:15:51.310
people are super positive,
it's super friendly,
they're like,
this is awesome,

1072
01:15:51.311 --> 01:15:54.940
this is great.
But sometimes I enter as an outside observer,

1073
01:15:54.941 --> 01:15:59.941
I entered the program in community and there seems to some sometimes be camps

1074
01:16:00.640 --> 01:16:04.180
and whatever the topic and and the two camps,

1075
01:16:04.181 --> 01:16:09.160
the two or plus camps often pretty harsh a criticizing the opposing camps

1076
01:16:11.380 --> 01:16:13.810
as,
as an onlooker.
I may be totally wrong on this.

1077
01:16:13.920 --> 01:16:16.190
<v 5>Yeah,
well like wars are,</v>

1078
01:16:16.240 --> 01:16:19.910
are sort of a favorite activity in the programming community.

1079
01:16:20.010 --> 01:16:22.440
<v 0>And what is the psychology behind that?
Is,</v>

1080
01:16:22.470 --> 01:16:27.000
is that okay for healthy community to have?
Is that,
is that a productive force

1081
01:16:27.200 --> 01:16:30.360
<v 5>similarly for the evolution of the language?
Well,</v>

1082
01:16:30.410 --> 01:16:35.410
if everybody is patting each other on the back and never telling the truth,

1083
01:16:36.200 --> 01:16:36.870
yes.

1084
01:16:36.870 --> 01:16:37.703
<v 1>Uh,</v>

1085
01:16:38.790 --> 01:16:40.260
<v 5>it would not be good thing.</v>

1086
01:16:40.860 --> 01:16:45.540
I think there is a middle ground where sort of

1087
01:16:48.740 --> 01:16:51.950
being nasty to each other is not okay.

1088
01:16:52.490 --> 01:16:55.160
But dare dare is,
is,

1089
01:16:55.161 --> 01:17:00.161
is a middle ground where there is healthy ongoing criticism and feedback that is

1090
01:17:02.001 --> 01:17:05.880
very productive.
And you,
you mean at,

1091
01:17:05.960 --> 01:17:09.980
at every level you see that,
I mean,
someone proposes to

1092
01:17:09.980 --> 01:17:14.280
<v 2>fix a very small issue in a code base.</v>

1093
01:17:15.080 --> 01:17:15.913
Uh,

1094
01:17:16.310 --> 01:17:21.310
chances are that some reviewer will sort of respond by saying,

1095
01:17:21.621 --> 01:17:24.290
well,
actually you can do it better the other way.

1096
01:17:24.500 --> 01:17:26.660
<v 1>All right.
Uh,</v>

1097
01:17:26.820 --> 01:17:31.590
<v 2>when it comes to deciding on the future of the Python,</v>

1098
01:17:31.591 --> 01:17:33.240
the core developer community,

1099
01:17:34.050 --> 01:17:39.000
we now have I think five or six competing proposals for a constitution.

1100
01:17:41.020 --> 01:17:45.010
<v 0>So that future,
do you have a fear of that future?</v>

1101
01:17:45.011 --> 01:17:46.660
Do you have a hope for the future?

1102
01:17:48.590 --> 01:17:52.430
<v 2>Confident about that future it by and large,</v>

1103
01:17:52.670 --> 01:17:57.140
I think that the debate has been very healthy and productive.

1104
01:17:57.830 --> 01:17:59.960
Uh,
and I actually went,

1105
01:17:59.990 --> 01:18:03.710
when I wrote that resignation email,

1106
01:18:04.670 --> 01:18:09.560
I knew that that python was in a very good spot and that the python core

1107
01:18:09.561 --> 01:18:11.050
development community,
the,

1108
01:18:11.051 --> 01:18:16.051
the group of 50 or a hundred people who sort of write or review most of the code

1109
01:18:19.491 --> 01:18:20.630
that goes into python,

1110
01:18:20.631 --> 01:18:24.680
those people get along very well.

1111
01:18:24.710 --> 01:18:27.260
Most of the time.
Uh,

1112
01:18:27.680 --> 01:18:32.680
a large number of different areas of expertise are represented.

1113
01:18:34.150 --> 01:18:34.983
<v 1>Uh,</v>

1114
01:18:36.460 --> 01:18:41.460
<v 2>different levels of experience in the Pif of Corp Dev community,</v>

1115
01:18:42.131 --> 01:18:47.131
different levels of experience completely outside in software development,

1116
01:18:47.231 --> 01:18:50.620
in general,
large systems,
small systems,

1117
01:18:51.040 --> 01:18:55.500
embedded systems.
So
I,

1118
01:18:55.660 --> 01:19:00.660
I felt okay resigning because I knew that that the community can really take

1119
01:19:01.271 --> 01:19:02.270
care of it itself.

1120
01:19:03.620 --> 01:19:08.150
<v 0>And out of a grab bag of future feature developments,</v>

1121
01:19:08.210 --> 01:19:13.210
let me ask if you can comment maybe on all very quickly,

1122
01:19:14.090 --> 01:19:17.600
concurrent programming,
parallel computing,
asynch io.

1123
01:19:18.890 --> 01:19:23.450
These are things that people have,
uh,
expressed hope,
complained about,

1124
01:19:23.780 --> 01:19:26.690
whatever have discussed on,
on reddit a sink.

1125
01:19:26.691 --> 01:19:29.930
I also the parallelization in general,
uh,
packaging,

1126
01:19:30.440 --> 01:19:33.680
I was totally clueless on this.
I just use Pixton install stuff,

1127
01:19:33.681 --> 01:19:36.260
but apparently there's pip and of poetry.

1128
01:19:36.261 --> 01:19:40.940
There's these dependency packaging systems that manage dependencies and so on

1129
01:19:41.120 --> 01:19:43.420
that are emerging and there's a lot of confusion about what's,

1130
01:19:43.570 --> 01:19:44.750
what's the right thing to use.

1131
01:19:45.230 --> 01:19:48.740
Then also a functional programming.

1132
01:19:49.030 --> 01:19:53.640
The the ever,
you know,
uh,
the,
the,
the uh,

1133
01:19:54.170 --> 01:19:56.930
I we're going to get more functional programming or not this kind of,

1134
01:19:57.020 --> 01:20:01.610
this kind of idea.
And of course the uh,
the,

1135
01:20:01.611 --> 01:20:03.190
the Gill as a

1136
01:20:04.850 --> 01:20:08.580
connected to the parallelization I suppose the global interpreter lock problem.

1137
01:20:08.581 --> 01:20:12.450
Can you just comment on whichever you want to comment on?

1138
01:20:13.050 --> 01:20:13.441
<v 2>Well,</v>

1139
01:20:13.441 --> 01:20:18.441
let's take the gill and pure realization and asynch io as one one topic.

1140
01:20:25.460 --> 01:20:30.460
I'm not that hopeful debt python will develop into a sort of high concurrency hi

1141
01:20:35.001 --> 01:20:38.540
parallelism language that sort of,

1142
01:20:38.570 --> 01:20:41.210
the way the language is designed,

1143
01:20:41.240 --> 01:20:44.390
the way most users use the language,

1144
01:20:44.600 --> 01:20:46.670
the way the language is implemented,

1145
01:20:47.240 --> 01:20:50.060
all make that a pretty unlikely future.

1146
01:20:50.180 --> 01:20:53.990
<v 0>So you think it might not even need to really the way people use it.</v>

1147
01:20:54.260 --> 01:20:57.440
It might not be something that should be of great

1148
01:20:57.620 --> 01:20:58.131
<v 2>I think.</v>

1149
01:20:58.131 --> 01:21:03.131
I think asynch io is a special case because it sort of allows overlapping io and

1150
01:21:05.150 --> 01:21:08.930
only io and doubt is,

1151
01:21:08.990 --> 01:21:13.990
is a sort of best practice of supporting very high throughput io many

1152
01:21:17.061 --> 01:21:20.630
collections.
Uh,
for a second.
Uh,

1153
01:21:21.650 --> 01:21:25.160
I'm not worried about that.
I think async io will evolve.

1154
01:21:25.161 --> 01:21:27.320
There are a couple of competing packages.

1155
01:21:27.321 --> 01:21:32.321
We have some very smart people who are sort of pushing us in sort of to make a

1156
01:21:34.101 --> 01:21:37.850
CIO better parallel computing.

1157
01:21:37.940 --> 01:21:42.320
I think that python is not the language for that.

1158
01:21:43.310 --> 01:21:48.230
Uh,
there are,
there are ways to work around it,
but you sort of,

1159
01:21:48.231 --> 01:21:53.231
you can't expect to write an algorithm in python and have a compiler

1160
01:21:55.070 --> 01:22:00.070
automatically paralyzed that what you can do is use a package like num Pi and

1161
01:22:00.651 --> 01:22:05.651
there are a bunch of other very powerful packages that sort of use all the CPS

1162
01:22:07.520 --> 01:22:12.020
available because you tell the package,
here's the data,

1163
01:22:12.230 --> 01:22:16.720
here's the abstract operation to apply over and go at it.
And then,

1164
01:22:16.750 --> 01:22:19.640
then we're back in the C plus plus world.
But the,

1165
01:22:19.850 --> 01:22:23.330
those packages are themselves implemented usually in c plus plus.

1166
01:22:23.540 --> 01:22:24.180
<v 0>That's right.</v>

1167
01:22:24.180 --> 01:22:27.080
That's where it tensorflow and all these bags just coming where they paralyzed

1168
01:22:27.090 --> 01:22:29.390
because gps for example,
they'd take care of that for you.

1169
01:22:29.750 --> 01:22:33.200
So in terms of packaging,
uh,
can you comment on,

1170
01:22:33.760 --> 01:22:34.480
<v 2>Ah,</v>

1171
01:22:34.480 --> 01:22:39.480
coaching and packaging has always been my least favorite topic.

1172
01:22:40.690 --> 01:22:41.800
It's,
it's,

1173
01:22:42.460 --> 01:22:47.460
it's a really tough problem because a d o s and the platform one to own

1174
01:22:50.591 --> 01:22:53.620
packaging,
uh,

1175
01:22:54.940 --> 01:22:59.770
but dare packaging solution is not specific to a language.

1176
01:23:00.040 --> 01:23:01.960
Like if you take Linux,

1177
01:23:01.961 --> 01:23:06.070
there are two competing packaging solutions for Linux or Unix

1178
01:23:06.070 --> 01:23:09.940
<v 5>in uh,
in general and,</v>

1179
01:23:09.970 --> 01:23:14.970
but they all work across all languages and several languages like node,

1180
01:23:18.770 --> 01:23:20.590
javascript,
uh,

1181
01:23:20.650 --> 01:23:25.650
and Ruby and python all have their own packaging solutions that only work within

1182
01:23:26.141 --> 01:23:30.730
the ecosystem of that language.
Well,
what should you use?

1183
01:23:31.690 --> 01:23:34.480
That is a tough problem.

1184
01:23:34.481 --> 01:23:39.481
My own own approach is I use the system packaging system to install python and I

1185
01:23:42.431 --> 01:23:47.431
use the python packaging system den to install third party python packages.

1186
01:23:48.970 --> 01:23:52.120
That's what most people do.
10 years ago,

1187
01:23:52.121 --> 01:23:55.840
Python packaging was really a terrible situation.

1188
01:23:56.290 --> 01:23:59.560
Nowadays,
pip is the future.
There is,

1189
01:23:59.561 --> 01:24:04.561
there is a separate ecosystem for a numerical and scientific Picom Python based

1190
01:24:05.831 --> 01:24:09.760
on Anaconda dose two can live together.

1191
01:24:09.761 --> 01:24:13.350
I don't think there is a need for more than that.
Great.
So that's,

1192
01:24:13.390 --> 01:24:14.223
that's packaging.

1193
01:24:14.310 --> 01:24:18.770
<v 0>That's,
well,
at least for me that's,
that's where I've been extremely happy.
I,</v>

1194
01:24:18.790 --> 01:24:22.170
I didn't,
I didn't even know this was an issue until it was brought up.
Well,

1195
01:24:22.171 --> 01:24:23.140
in the interest of time,

1196
01:24:23.141 --> 01:24:27.030
I mean you sort of skipped through a million other questions I have.

1197
01:24:27.440 --> 01:24:31.850
So watch the five hour,
five,
five and a half hour oral history,
uh,

1198
01:24:31.890 --> 01:24:35.150
the abdominal,
the Computer History Museum and the Nice thing about it,

1199
01:24:35.180 --> 01:24:38.300
it gave this,
because of the linear progression of the interview,

1200
01:24:38.610 --> 01:24:41.500
he gave this feeling of a life,
you know,

1201
01:24:41.540 --> 01:24:46.290
a life well lived with interesting things in it.
Um,

1202
01:24:47.150 --> 01:24:50.270
sort of a pretty,
I would say a good spend of,

1203
01:24:50.320 --> 01:24:54.650
of this little existence we have on earth.
So outside of your family,

1204
01:24:55.520 --> 01:25:00.140
looking back,
what about this journey are you really proud of?

1205
01:25:02.780 --> 01:25:06.530
Are there moments that stand out?
Accomplishments,
ideas?

1206
01:25:06.920 --> 01:25:10.370
Is it the creation of python itself?

1207
01:25:10.400 --> 01:25:14.240
The stands out as a thing that you look back and say,
damn,

1208
01:25:14.241 --> 01:25:15.200
I did pretty good there.

1209
01:25:16.180 --> 01:25:17.013
<v 4>Okay.</v>

1210
01:25:17.660 --> 01:25:22.040
<v 5>Well,
I would say that python is definitely the best thing I've ever done.</v>

1211
01:25:23.580 --> 01:25:28.470
And I wouldn't sort of say just the creation of python,

1212
01:25:28.471 --> 01:25:33.471
but the way I sort of raised by form like a baby.

1213
01:25:36.570 --> 01:25:38.550
I didn't just conceive a child,

1214
01:25:38.580 --> 01:25:43.320
but I raised a child and now I'm setting the child free in the world.

1215
01:25:43.321 --> 01:25:46.410
And I've set up the child to,

1216
01:25:46.470 --> 01:25:51.330
to sort of be able to take care of himself.
And I'm,
I'm very proud of that.

1217
01:25:52.420 --> 01:25:55.900
<v 0>And as the announcer of Monte Python's flying circus used to say,</v>

1218
01:25:55.901 --> 01:25:57.820
and now for something completely different,

1219
01:25:58.570 --> 01:26:03.170
do you have a favorite Monty python moment or a moment hitchhiker's guide or any

1220
01:26:03.171 --> 01:26:07.500
other literature show,
a movie that cracks you up when you think about it?
Oh,

1221
01:26:07.580 --> 01:26:12.560
you can always play me.
The parents,
the dead parent sketch.
Oh,
that's brilliant.

1222
01:26:12.590 --> 01:26:14.630
Yeah,
that's my favorite as well.

1223
01:26:17.690 --> 01:26:20.330
Okay,
great.
Thank you so much for talking with me today.

1224
01:26:22.240 --> 01:26:23.720
It's been a great conversation.
