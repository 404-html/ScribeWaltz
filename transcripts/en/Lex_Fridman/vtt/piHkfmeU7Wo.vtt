3
00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:06.900
<v Speaker 1>I got a chance to sit down and Christof </v>

<v Speaker 1>neurobiology and neuroscience and </v>

5
00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:16.830
<v Speaker 1>generally in the study of consciousness.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's the president,</v>

<v Speaker 1>scientific community and the general </v>

12
00:00:40.221 --> 00:00:44.481
<v Speaker 1>public in the way we think about </v>
<v Speaker 1>consciousness in the way we see </v>

<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

22
00:01:12.131 --> 00:01:16.240
<v Speaker 1>Before we delve into the beautiful </v>
<v Speaker 1>mysteries of consciousness,</v>

23
00:01:16.480 --> 00:01:20.250
<v Speaker 1>let's zoom out a little bit and let me </v>
<v Speaker 1>ask,</v>

24
00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:23.470
<v Speaker 1>do you think there's intelligent life </v>
<v Speaker 1>out there in the universe or.</v>

25
00:01:23.550 --> 00:01:24.870
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I do believe so.</v>

26
00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:30.440
<v Speaker 2>We have no evidence of it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I think the possibilities are </v>

27
00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:32.340
<v Speaker 2>overwhelming in favor of it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Give them a universe of where we have 10</v>

28
00:01:32.341 --> 00:01:35.610
<v Speaker 2>to 11 galaxies and each galaxy has </v>
<v Speaker 2>between 10 to 11,</v>

29
00:01:35.611 --> 00:01:36.360
<v Speaker 2>10 to the twelfth</v>

30
00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:42.310
<v Speaker 1>stars.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And we know most stars have one or more </v>

31
00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:42.510
<v Speaker 1>planet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So how does that make you feel?</v>

32
00:01:43.430 --> 00:01:48.270
<v Speaker 1>It still makes me feel special because I</v>
<v Speaker 1>have experiences.</v>

33
00:01:49.050 --> 00:01:51.030
<v Speaker 1>I feel the world experienced the world</v>

34
00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:57.000
<v Speaker 2>and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>independent of whether they are other </v>

35
00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:58.780
<v Speaker 2>creatures out there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I still feel the world and I have access</v>

36
00:01:58.781 --> 00:02:01.480
<v Speaker 2>to this world in this very strange,</v>
<v Speaker 2>compelling way.</v>

37
00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:06.830
<v Speaker 1>And that's the core of human existence.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now you said human.</v>

38
00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:10.310
<v Speaker 1>Do you think if those intelligent </v>
<v Speaker 1>creatures are out there,</v>

39
00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:13.650
<v Speaker 1>do you think they experience their </v>
<v Speaker 1>world?</v>

40
00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:14.720
<v Speaker 1>That's true.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They</v>

41
00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:19.760
<v Speaker 2>evolved.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If they are a product of natural </v>

42
00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:19.760
<v Speaker 2>evolution,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if they would have to be,</v>

43
00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:19.970
<v Speaker 2>they will also experience the owned </v>
<v Speaker 2>world.</v>

44
00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:22.650
<v Speaker 2>The consciousness isn't just Schumann.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You hide it.</v>

45
00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:24.320
<v Speaker 2>It's much wider.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's probably.</v>

46
00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:29.560
<v Speaker 2>It may be spread across all of biology.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We have the only thing that we have </v>

47
00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:30.770
<v Speaker 2>specialists.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We can talk about it.</v>

48
00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:36.300
<v Speaker 2>I've got not all people can talk about </v>
<v Speaker 2>the babies and little children can talk </v>

49
00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:38.420
<v Speaker 2>about a patient who have.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We have a stoke in the left.</v>

50
00:02:38.421 --> 00:02:40.310
<v Speaker 2>Inferior frontal gyrus can talk about </v>
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>

51
00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:45.760
<v Speaker 2>but most normal adult people can talk </v>
<v Speaker 2>about it and so we think that makes us </v>

52
00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:47.860
<v Speaker 2>special compared to letting monkeys or </v>
<v Speaker 2>dogs or cats and mice,</v>

53
00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:50.120
<v Speaker 2>all the other creatures that we share </v>
<v Speaker 2>the planet with,</v>

54
00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:54.560
<v Speaker 2>but all the evidence seems to suggest </v>
<v Speaker 2>that they to experience the world and so</v>

55
00:02:54.561 --> 00:02:59.561
<v Speaker 2>it's like overwhelmingly likely that </v>
<v Speaker 2>other alien that aliens would also </v>

56
00:02:59.561 --> 00:03:03.191
<v Speaker 2>experience their world of course </v>
<v Speaker 2>differently because they have a </v>

57
00:03:03.191 --> 00:03:03.191
<v Speaker 2>difference in psyllium.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They have different sense of.</v>

58
00:03:03.191 --> 00:03:07.681
<v Speaker 2>They have a very different environment,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the fact that I would strongly </v>

59
00:03:07.681 --> 00:03:12.610
<v Speaker 2>support that they also have experiences </v>
<v Speaker 2>if your pain and pleasure and see in </v>

60
00:03:13.121 --> 00:03:15.580
<v Speaker 2>some sort of spectrum and he,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

61
00:03:15.581 --> 00:03:17.290
<v Speaker 2>and have all the other senses,</v>

62
00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:19.440
<v Speaker 1>of course their language if they have </v>
<v Speaker 1>one,</v>

63
00:03:19.450 --> 00:03:24.450
<v Speaker 1>will be different.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So women understand their poetry about </v>

64
00:03:24.450 --> 00:03:25.120
<v Speaker 1>the experiences that they have.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's correct.</v>

65
00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:27.790
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So in a talk,</v>

66
00:03:27.820 --> 00:03:32.350
<v Speaker 1>in a video,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've heard you mentioned adac sound that</v>

67
00:03:32.351 --> 00:03:36.090
<v Speaker 1>you came up with the you grew up with as</v>
<v Speaker 1>part of your family when you were young.</v>

68
00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:41.750
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>first of all your technically a </v>

69
00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:44.381
<v Speaker 1>midwestern boy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He just technically after that,</v>

70
00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:48.050
<v Speaker 1>a trial of that are on a bit and a </v>
<v Speaker 1>little bit of the accent.</v>

71
00:03:48.290 --> 00:03:53.290
<v Speaker 1>You talked about supports all the taxol </v>
<v Speaker 1>and having these elements of human </v>

72
00:03:54.080 --> 00:03:56.500
<v Speaker 1>humanness,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of consciousness that you discovered.</v>

73
00:03:56.510 --> 00:04:01.510
<v Speaker 1>So I just wanted to ask,</v>
<v Speaker 1>can you look back in your childhood and </v>

74
00:04:01.510 --> 00:04:04.970
<v Speaker 1>remember when was the first time you </v>
<v Speaker 1>realized you yourself sort of form a </v>

75
00:04:04.970 --> 00:04:09.900
<v Speaker 1>third person perspective or our </v>
<v Speaker 1>conscious being this idea of no stepping</v>

76
00:04:11.971 --> 00:04:16.971
<v Speaker 1>outside of yourself and seeing there's </v>
<v Speaker 1>something special going on here in my </v>

77
00:04:16.971 --> 00:04:16.971
<v Speaker 1>brain.</v>

78
00:04:17.840 --> 00:04:19.660
<v Speaker 2>I can't really accurate.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a good question.</v>

79
00:04:19.661 --> 00:04:24.661
<v Speaker 2>I'm not sure I recall a discreet moment.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean you take it for granted because </v>

80
00:04:24.661 --> 00:04:29.011
<v Speaker 2>that's the only world you know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The only world I know you know is the </v>

81
00:04:29.011 --> 00:04:32.971
<v Speaker 2>world of seeing and hearing voices and </v>
<v Speaker 2>touching and all the other thing,</v>

82
00:04:33.591 --> 00:04:38.450
<v Speaker 2>so it's only much later at early in my </v>
<v Speaker 2>undergrad days when I became,</v>

83
00:04:38.880 --> 00:04:43.880
<v Speaker 2>when I enrolled in physics and in </v>
<v Speaker 2>philosophy that I really thought about </v>

84
00:04:43.880 --> 00:04:43.880
<v Speaker 2>it and thought,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

85
00:04:43.880 --> 00:04:47.400
<v Speaker 2>this is really fundamentally very,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very mysterious and there's nothing </v>

86
00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:51.001
<v Speaker 2>really in physics right now that </v>
<v Speaker 2>explains this transition from the </v>

87
00:04:51.001 --> 00:04:54.361
<v Speaker 2>physics of the brain to feelings.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Where do the feelings come in until you </v>

88
00:04:54.361 --> 00:04:56.320
<v Speaker 2>can look at the foundational equation of</v>
<v Speaker 2>quantum mechanics,</v>

89
00:04:56.530 --> 00:05:01.530
<v Speaker 2>general relativity.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can look at the period table of the </v>

90
00:05:01.530 --> 00:05:04.021
<v Speaker 2>elements.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can look at the endless atg seat </v>

91
00:05:04.021 --> 00:05:05.530
<v Speaker 2>chat and our genes and no is </v>
<v Speaker 2>consciousness.</v>

92
00:05:05.531 --> 00:05:10.531
<v Speaker 2>Yet I wake up every morning to a world </v>
<v Speaker 2>where I have experiences and so that's </v>

93
00:05:10.531 --> 00:05:12.520
<v Speaker 2>the hub of the ancient mind body </v>
<v Speaker 2>problem.</v>

94
00:05:12.521 --> 00:05:17.521
<v Speaker 2>How do explain to get into the world?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So what is consciousness,</v>

95
00:05:19.120 --> 00:05:23.170
<v Speaker 2>experience consciousness as any,</v>
<v Speaker 2>any con,</v>

96
00:05:23.290 --> 00:05:26.350
<v Speaker 2>any experience?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Some people call it subjective feelings,</v>

97
00:05:26.360 --> 00:05:29.340
<v Speaker 2>some people call it a phenomenon,</v>
<v Speaker 2>phenomenology,</v>

98
00:05:29.360 --> 00:05:31.390
<v Speaker 2>some people call it quality of their </v>
<v Speaker 2>philosophy,</v>

99
00:05:31.420 --> 00:05:36.420
<v Speaker 2>but they all did note the same thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It feels like something in the famous </v>

100
00:05:36.420 --> 00:05:39.961
<v Speaker 2>word for the philosopher Thomas Nagel.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It feels like something to be a bad or </v>

101
00:05:39.961 --> 00:05:42.420
<v Speaker 2>to be a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

102
00:05:42.740 --> 00:05:47.650
<v Speaker 2>an American or to be angry or to be sad </v>
<v Speaker 2>or to be in love or to have pain</v>

103
00:05:49.140 --> 00:05:54.140
<v Speaker 2>and that is what experience is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Any possible experience could be as </v>

104
00:05:54.140 --> 00:05:56.690
<v Speaker 2>mundane as just sitting in a chair could</v>
<v Speaker 2>be as excited as,</v>

105
00:05:56.970 --> 00:05:58.700
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>having a mystical moment,</v>

106
00:05:58.760 --> 00:05:59.630
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

107
00:05:59.780 --> 00:06:01.120
<v Speaker 2>in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in deep meditation,</v>

108
00:06:01.121 --> 00:06:03.140
<v Speaker 2>those also just different forms of </v>
<v Speaker 2>experiences,</v>

109
00:06:03.250 --> 00:06:08.250
<v Speaker 1>experience.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if you were to sit down with maybe </v>

110
00:06:08.250 --> 00:06:12.691
<v Speaker 1>the next,</v>
<v Speaker 1>skip a couple of generations of Ibm </v>

111
00:06:12.691 --> 00:06:12.880
<v Speaker 1>Watson,</v>
<v Speaker 1>something that won jeopardy,</v>

112
00:06:13.030 --> 00:06:16.720
<v Speaker 1>what is the gap?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I guess the question is between Watson,</v>

113
00:06:17.710 --> 00:06:22.710
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that might be a much smarter than you </v>

114
00:06:22.710 --> 00:06:25.320
<v Speaker 1>than us,</v>
<v Speaker 1>than all any human alive but may not </v>

115
00:06:25.320 --> 00:06:26.950
<v Speaker 1>have experience.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What is the gap?</v>

116
00:06:28.420 --> 00:06:29.680
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so that's a big,</v>

117
00:06:29.681 --> 00:06:32.110
<v Speaker 2>big question that's occupy people for </v>
<v Speaker 2>the last,</v>

118
00:06:32.680 --> 00:06:36.190
<v Speaker 2>certainly the last 50 years since we,</v>
<v Speaker 2>since the advent,</v>

119
00:06:36.220 --> 00:06:41.220
<v Speaker 2>the birth of have a computer question </v>
<v Speaker 2>and chilling title answer and of course </v>

120
00:06:41.241 --> 00:06:46.241
<v Speaker 2>he did it in this indirect way by </v>
<v Speaker 2>proposing it's tests and operational </v>

121
00:06:46.241 --> 00:06:46.241
<v Speaker 2>tests.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

122
00:06:46.241 --> 00:06:48.220
<v Speaker 2>but that's not really,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's,</v>

123
00:06:48.290 --> 00:06:49.340
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he tried to get it.</v>

124
00:06:49.341 --> 00:06:54.341
<v Speaker 2>What does it mean for a person to think </v>
<v Speaker 2>and then he had this test that you lock </v>

125
00:06:54.341 --> 00:06:58.061
<v Speaker 2>them away and then you have a </v>
<v Speaker 2>communication with them and then you </v>

126
00:06:58.061 --> 00:07:00.660
<v Speaker 2>title to guess after a whether that is a</v>
<v Speaker 2>personal or whether it's a computer </v>

127
00:07:00.660 --> 00:07:04.781
<v Speaker 2>system.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's no question that now or very </v>

128
00:07:04.781 --> 00:07:04.781
<v Speaker 2>soon,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

129
00:07:04.781 --> 00:07:08.021
<v Speaker 2>Alexa or Siri or Google,</v>
<v Speaker 2>now we'll pass this test and you can </v>

130
00:07:08.021 --> 00:07:08.890
<v Speaker 2>game it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But you know,</v>

131
00:07:08.900 --> 00:07:13.900
<v Speaker 2>ultimately,</v>
<v Speaker 2>certainly in your generation there will </v>

132
00:07:13.900 --> 00:07:17.351
<v Speaker 2>be machines that will speak with </v>
<v Speaker 2>complete poise that will remember </v>

133
00:07:17.351 --> 00:07:17.351
<v Speaker 2>everything you've ever said that.</v>

134
00:07:17.351 --> 00:07:20.130
<v Speaker 2>Remember every email you ever had like </v>
<v Speaker 2>Samantha,</v>

135
00:07:20.131 --> 00:07:25.131
<v Speaker 2>remember in the movie her.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's no question it's going to have a </v>

136
00:07:25.131 --> 00:07:28.300
<v Speaker 2>happen,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but of course the key question is it </v>

137
00:07:28.300 --> 00:07:30.671
<v Speaker 2>doesn't feel like anything to be </v>
<v Speaker 2>Samantha in the movie her or does it </v>

138
00:07:30.671 --> 00:07:33.830
<v Speaker 2>feel like anything to be Watson and </v>
<v Speaker 2>there one has to be very,</v>

139
00:07:34.460 --> 00:07:39.460
<v Speaker 2>very strongly think they're two </v>
<v Speaker 2>different concepts here that we call </v>

140
00:07:39.460 --> 00:07:40.850
<v Speaker 2>mingle.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There is a concept of intelligence,</v>

141
00:07:41.330 --> 00:07:46.330
<v Speaker 2>natural or artificial,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and there is a concept of consciousness </v>

142
00:07:46.330 --> 00:07:47.270
<v Speaker 2>of experience,</v>
<v Speaker 2>natural or artificial.</v>

143
00:07:47.271 --> 00:07:49.040
<v Speaker 2>Those are very,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very different things.</v>

144
00:07:49.670 --> 00:07:53.060
<v Speaker 2>Now historically with associate </v>
<v Speaker 2>consciousness was intelligence.</v>

145
00:07:53.061 --> 00:07:56.180
<v Speaker 2>Why?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because we live in a world leaving aside</v>

146
00:07:56.181 --> 00:08:00.560
<v Speaker 2>computers of of natural selection where </v>
<v Speaker 2>we're surrounded by creatures,</v>

147
00:08:00.561 --> 00:08:05.300
<v Speaker 2>either our own kin that are less or more</v>
<v Speaker 2>intelligent or we go costs feces.</v>

148
00:08:05.360 --> 00:08:10.360
<v Speaker 2>Some.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Some are more adapted to particular </v>

149
00:08:10.360 --> 00:08:10.360
<v Speaker 2>environment.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Others unless adapted,</v>

150
00:08:10.360 --> 00:08:13.660
<v Speaker 2>whether it's a whale or a dog or you go </v>
<v Speaker 2>talk to him or a little worm,</v>

151
00:08:14.480 --> 00:08:19.480
<v Speaker 2>and we see the complexity of the nervous</v>
<v Speaker 2>system goes from one cell to two,</v>

152
00:08:19.790 --> 00:08:24.170
<v Speaker 2>a specialized cells to a worm that has </v>
<v Speaker 2>been at that has 30 percent of its cells</v>

153
00:08:24.171 --> 00:08:29.171
<v Speaker 2>and nerve cells to creature like us or </v>
<v Speaker 2>like a blue whale that have had 100 </v>

154
00:08:29.171 --> 00:08:33.730
<v Speaker 2>billion nerve cells and so based on </v>
<v Speaker 2>behavioral evidence and based on the </v>

155
00:08:33.730 --> 00:08:38.141
<v Speaker 2>underlying neuroscience,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we believe that as his creatures become </v>

156
00:08:38.141 --> 00:08:42.101
<v Speaker 2>more complex,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they are better adapted to their </v>

157
00:08:42.101 --> 00:08:45.521
<v Speaker 2>particular ecological niche and they </v>
<v Speaker 2>become more conscious partly because </v>

158
00:08:45.531 --> 00:08:47.720
<v Speaker 2>their brain calls and we believe </v>
<v Speaker 2>consciousness,</v>

159
00:08:47.721 --> 00:08:52.721
<v Speaker 2>unlike the ancient ancient people </v>
<v Speaker 2>thought most almost every culture </v>

160
00:08:52.721 --> 00:08:56.351
<v Speaker 2>thought that consciousness was </v>
<v Speaker 2>intelligence has to do with your heart </v>

161
00:08:56.351 --> 00:08:56.880
<v Speaker 2>and you still see that today.</v>

162
00:08:56.880 --> 00:08:57.480
<v Speaker 2>You see,</v>
<v Speaker 2>honey,</v>

163
00:08:57.481 --> 00:09:00.600
<v Speaker 2>I love you with all my house,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but what you should actually say,</v>

164
00:09:00.650 --> 00:09:01.410
<v Speaker 2>you say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no honey,</v>

165
00:09:01.411 --> 00:09:05.460
<v Speaker 2>I love you was all my lateral </v>
<v Speaker 2>hypothalamus and for Valentine's Day you</v>

166
00:09:05.461 --> 00:09:07.060
<v Speaker 2>should give you a sweetheart,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a,</v>

167
00:09:07.100 --> 00:09:12.100
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a hypothalamic shame piece of chocolate </v>

168
00:09:12.100 --> 00:09:12.100
<v Speaker 2>and not a hardship chocolate.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

169
00:09:12.100 --> 00:09:17.080
<v Speaker 2>So we still have this language,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but now we believe it's a brain and so </v>

170
00:09:17.080 --> 00:09:17.080
<v Speaker 2>we see brains of different complexity </v>
<v Speaker 2>and we think,</v>

171
00:09:17.080 --> 00:09:21.891
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they have different levels of </v>

172
00:09:21.891 --> 00:09:22.200
<v Speaker 2>consciousness that capable of different </v>
<v Speaker 2>experiences.</v>

173
00:09:22.620 --> 00:09:27.620
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but now we confront a world where we </v>

174
00:09:27.620 --> 00:09:32.511
<v Speaker 2>know where we're beginning to engineer </v>
<v Speaker 2>intelligence and it's graphical,</v>

175
00:09:33.030 --> 00:09:38.030
<v Speaker 2>unclear whether the intelligence we </v>
<v Speaker 2>engineering has anything to do with </v>

176
00:09:38.030 --> 00:09:42.171
<v Speaker 2>consciousness and whether it can </v>
<v Speaker 2>experience anything because </v>

177
00:09:42.171 --> 00:09:42.990
<v Speaker 2>fundamentally what's the difference?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Intelligence.</v>

178
00:09:42.991 --> 00:09:46.440
<v Speaker 2>It's about function intelligence,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no matter exactly how you define it,</v>

179
00:09:46.441 --> 00:09:51.441
<v Speaker 2>sort of adaptation to new environments.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Being able to learn and quickly </v>

180
00:09:51.441 --> 00:09:55.431
<v Speaker 2>understand the setup of this and what's </v>
<v Speaker 2>going on and who the actors and what's </v>

181
00:09:55.431 --> 00:09:56.940
<v Speaker 2>going to happen next.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's all about function.</v>

182
00:09:57.570 --> 00:10:00.890
<v Speaker 2>Consciousness is not about function </v>
<v Speaker 2>consciousness,</v>

183
00:10:00.891 --> 00:10:04.200
<v Speaker 2>it's about being in some sense,</v>
<v Speaker 2>much fundamental.</v>

184
00:10:05.560 --> 00:10:08.710
<v Speaker 2>You can see folks that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can see this in several cases.</v>

185
00:10:08.711 --> 00:10:09.820
<v Speaker 2>You can see it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>For instance,</v>

186
00:10:09.821 --> 00:10:14.821
<v Speaker 2>in the case of the clinic,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when you're dealing with patients who </v>

187
00:10:14.821 --> 00:10:16.810
<v Speaker 2>are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's say had a stoke or had one traffic</v>

188
00:10:16.811 --> 00:10:18.030
<v Speaker 2>accident,</v>
<v Speaker 2>etc.</v>

189
00:10:18.720 --> 00:10:20.780
<v Speaker 3>They're pretty much immobile.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Terry shy boy,</v>

190
00:10:21.250 --> 00:10:26.250
<v Speaker 3>you may have heard historically,</v>
<v Speaker 3>she was a person here in the in the </v>

191
00:10:26.250 --> 00:10:27.540
<v Speaker 3>nineties and Florida judge heart stood </v>
<v Speaker 3>still.</v>

192
00:10:27.541 --> 00:10:31.530
<v Speaker 3>She was really animated and for the next</v>
<v Speaker 3>14 years she was in a vegetative state,</v>

193
00:10:32.130 --> 00:10:33.930
<v Speaker 3>so there's thousands of people in a </v>
<v Speaker 3>vegetative state,</v>

194
00:10:33.931 --> 00:10:34.770
<v Speaker 3>so they're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

195
00:10:34.780 --> 00:10:35.620
<v Speaker 3>they are,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

196
00:10:35.640 --> 00:10:40.640
<v Speaker 3>they're like this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Occasionally they opened the eyes for </v>

197
00:10:40.640 --> 00:10:40.640
<v Speaker 3>two,</v>
<v Speaker 3>three,</v>

198
00:10:40.640 --> 00:10:40.640
<v Speaker 3>four,</v>
<v Speaker 3>five,</v>

199
00:10:40.640 --> 00:10:41.140
<v Speaker 3>six,</v>
<v Speaker 3>eight hours and then close the eyes.</v>

200
00:10:41.141 --> 00:10:42.360
<v Speaker 3>They have sleep,</v>
<v Speaker 3>wake cycle.</v>

201
00:10:42.870 --> 00:10:47.870
<v Speaker 3>Occasionally they have behavior they do,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but there's no way that you can </v>

202
00:10:48.751 --> 00:10:53.751
<v Speaker 3>establish a lawful relationship between </v>
<v Speaker 3>what you say or the doctor says or the </v>

203
00:10:53.751 --> 00:10:55.830
<v Speaker 3>mom says and what the patient does.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

204
00:10:56.040 --> 00:10:57.960
<v Speaker 3>so the.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So the.</v>

205
00:10:57.990 --> 00:11:00.810
<v Speaker 3>There isn't any behavior.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Get in some of these people.</v>

206
00:11:00.811 --> 00:11:02.760
<v Speaker 3>There is still experience.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can,</v>

207
00:11:03.020 --> 00:11:08.020
<v Speaker 3>you can design and build brain machine </v>
<v Speaker 3>interfaces where you can see there's </v>

208
00:11:08.020 --> 00:11:12.950
<v Speaker 3>still experienced something and of </v>
<v Speaker 3>course that these cases have blocked in </v>

209
00:11:12.950 --> 00:11:12.950
<v Speaker 3>state.</v>

210
00:11:12.950 --> 00:11:14.730
<v Speaker 3>There's a famous book called the diving </v>
<v Speaker 3>bell and the butterfly.</v>

211
00:11:15.210 --> 00:11:17.060
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you had an ediTor to edit a year.</v>

212
00:11:17.061 --> 00:11:22.050
<v Speaker 3>The stoke in the in the brain stem,</v>
<v Speaker 3>unable to move except his vertical eyes,</v>

213
00:11:22.320 --> 00:11:25.260
<v Speaker 3>eye movement.</v>
<v Speaker 3>he could just move his eyes up and down.</v>

214
00:11:25.261 --> 00:11:30.210
<v Speaker 3>When you dictated an entire book and </v>
<v Speaker 3>some people even lose this at the end it</v>

215
00:11:30.211 --> 00:11:33.300
<v Speaker 3>all the evidence seems to suggest that </v>
<v Speaker 3>they're still in there.</v>

216
00:11:33.520 --> 00:11:35.820
<v Speaker 3>In this case,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you have no behavior.</v>

217
00:11:35.850 --> 00:11:38.610
<v Speaker 3>You have consciousness.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Second cases tonight,</v>

218
00:11:38.670 --> 00:11:40.530
<v Speaker 3>like all of us,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're going to go to sleep,</v>

219
00:11:41.100 --> 00:11:42.480
<v Speaker 3>close your eyes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you go to sleep.</v>

220
00:11:42.720 --> 00:11:47.720
<v Speaker 3>You will wake up inside your sleeping </v>
<v Speaker 3>body and you will have conscious </v>

221
00:11:47.720 --> 00:11:49.800
<v Speaker 3>experiences are different from everyday </v>
<v Speaker 3>experience.</v>

222
00:11:49.801 --> 00:11:54.801
<v Speaker 3>You might fly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You might not be surprised that you're </v>

223
00:11:54.801 --> 00:11:55.120
<v Speaker 3>flying.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You might meet a long dead pet childhood</v>

224
00:11:55.121 --> 00:11:57.940
<v Speaker 3>dog and you're not surprised that you're</v>
<v Speaker 3>meeting them,</v>

225
00:11:57.941 --> 00:12:02.941
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you have conscious experience of </v>

226
00:12:02.941 --> 00:12:02.941
<v Speaker 3>love,</v>
<v Speaker 3>of hates.</v>

227
00:12:02.941 --> 00:12:03.670
<v Speaker 3>You know they can be very emotional.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Your body during this state,</v>

228
00:12:03.680 --> 00:12:08.680
<v Speaker 3>it typically to them state sends an </v>
<v Speaker 3>active signal to your motor neurons to </v>

229
00:12:08.680 --> 00:12:13.501
<v Speaker 3>paralyze you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's called tanya because if you don't </v>

230
00:12:13.501 --> 00:12:13.720
<v Speaker 3>have that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like some patients,</v>

231
00:12:13.721 --> 00:12:15.490
<v Speaker 3>what do you do?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You act out your dreams.</v>

232
00:12:15.550 --> 00:12:18.010
<v Speaker 3>You get proximal behavioral disorder,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is about,</v>

233
00:12:18.160 --> 00:12:20.150
<v Speaker 3>which is bad juju to get.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

234
00:12:20.620 --> 00:12:23.860
<v Speaker 3>Sad case is pure experience.</v>
<v Speaker 3>so I recently had this,</v>

235
00:12:25.060 --> 00:12:27.310
<v Speaker 3>what some people call it mystical </v>
<v Speaker 3>experience.</v>

236
00:12:27.460 --> 00:12:30.100
<v Speaker 3>I went to Singapore and went into </v>
<v Speaker 3>flotation tank,</v>

237
00:12:30.810 --> 00:12:35.810
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>So this is a big tub filled was with </v>

238
00:12:35.810 --> 00:12:37.450
<v Speaker 3>water.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's body temperature and epsom salt.</v>

239
00:12:37.720 --> 00:12:39.290
<v Speaker 3>You strip completely naked,</v>
<v Speaker 3>july,</v>

240
00:12:39.310 --> 00:12:41.080
<v Speaker 3>inside of it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you close the lid,</v>

241
00:12:41.140 --> 00:12:43.120
<v Speaker 3>darkness,</v>
<v Speaker 3>complete darkness,</v>

242
00:12:43.590 --> 00:12:48.590
<v Speaker 3>soundproof.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So very quickly you become body less </v>

243
00:12:48.590 --> 00:12:48.590
<v Speaker 3>because you're floating and you're </v>
<v Speaker 3>naked.</v>

244
00:12:48.590 --> 00:12:49.720
<v Speaker 3>You have no rings,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no watch,</v>

245
00:12:49.721 --> 00:12:51.790
<v Speaker 3>no nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You don't feel your body anymore.</v>

246
00:12:52.920 --> 00:12:56.320
<v Speaker 3>No sound soundless.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's no a photon,</v>

247
00:12:56.660 --> 00:13:00.020
<v Speaker 3>a sightless timeless because after a </v>
<v Speaker 3>while,</v>

248
00:13:00.070 --> 00:13:01.720
<v Speaker 3>early on,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're actually hear your heart,</v>

249
00:13:02.260 --> 00:13:06.460
<v Speaker 3>but then that you sort of adapt to that </v>
<v Speaker 3>and then sort oF the pathogen of time,</v>

250
00:13:06.461 --> 00:13:09.670
<v Speaker 3>csus,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and if you train yourself like in a,</v>

251
00:13:09.671 --> 00:13:11.620
<v Speaker 3>in a meditation,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not to sleep early on,</v>

252
00:13:11.621 --> 00:13:13.510
<v Speaker 3>you think a lot,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's a little bit spooky,</v>

253
00:13:13.511 --> 00:13:15.340
<v Speaker 3>you feel somewhat uncomfortable or you </v>
<v Speaker 3>think,</v>

254
00:13:15.341 --> 00:13:16.420
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to get bored,</v>

255
00:13:16.870 --> 00:13:19.990
<v Speaker 3>but if your title not to think actively,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you become mindless.</v>

256
00:13:20.200 --> 00:13:22.540
<v Speaker 3>So there you are.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Body less timeless.</v>

257
00:13:23.680 --> 00:13:27.940
<v Speaker 3>Soundless sightless mindless.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But you're in a conscious experience,</v>

258
00:13:27.941 --> 00:13:29.770
<v Speaker 3>you're not asleep,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're not asleep,</v>

259
00:13:29.780 --> 00:13:30.250
<v Speaker 3>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>

260
00:13:30.460 --> 00:13:33.580
<v Speaker 3>you are being a pure,</v>
<v Speaker 3>pure being.</v>

261
00:13:33.581 --> 00:13:36.220
<v Speaker 3>There isn't any function.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You aren't doing any computation,</v>

262
00:13:36.221 --> 00:13:37.930
<v Speaker 3>you're not remembering,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're not projecting,</v>

263
00:13:37.931 --> 00:13:40.510
<v Speaker 3>you're not planning yet.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You are fully conscious,</v>

264
00:13:40.720 --> 00:13:42.850
<v Speaker 3>fully conscious.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There is something going out there.</v>

265
00:13:42.850 --> 00:13:45.070
<v Speaker 3>It could be just a side effect.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So what is the,</v>

266
00:13:45.071 --> 00:13:49.060
<v Speaker 3>the epi phenomenon.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So what is the select effect?</v>

267
00:13:49.450 --> 00:13:51.570
<v Speaker 3>Meaning why?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

268
00:13:51.990 --> 00:13:52.550
<v Speaker 3>what,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what,</v>

269
00:13:52.551 --> 00:13:57.130
<v Speaker 3>what is the function of you being able </v>
<v Speaker 3>to lay in this sense,</v>

270
00:13:57.160 --> 00:14:00.880
<v Speaker 3>sensory free deprivation tank and still </v>
<v Speaker 3>have a conscious experience?</v>

271
00:14:02.620 --> 00:14:06.430
<v Speaker 3>Obviously we didn't evolve with </v>
<v Speaker 3>flotation tanks in our environment.</v>

272
00:14:06.740 --> 00:14:11.740
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so biology is notoriously bad at asking </v>

273
00:14:11.740 --> 00:14:11.740
<v Speaker 3>why.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Question anomic question,</v>

274
00:14:11.740 --> 00:14:14.920
<v Speaker 3>why do we have two eyes?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Why don't we have four or three hours or</v>

275
00:14:14.921 --> 00:14:15.550
<v Speaker 3>something?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

276
00:14:15.551 --> 00:14:16.800
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's probably a bit.</v>

277
00:14:16.820 --> 00:14:18.690
<v Speaker 3>It'S a function to that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's,</v>

278
00:14:18.910 --> 00:14:21.130
<v Speaker 3>we're not very good at answering those </v>
<v Speaker 3>questions.</v>

279
00:14:21.131 --> 00:14:26.131
<v Speaker 3>We can speculate.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And leslie were biologists or </v>

280
00:14:26.131 --> 00:14:26.131
<v Speaker 3>scientists,</v>
<v Speaker 3>very good about mechanistic question,</v>

281
00:14:26.131 --> 00:14:27.140
<v Speaker 3>why they're charging the universe,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

282
00:14:27.310 --> 00:14:29.860
<v Speaker 3>We find the universe were there positive</v>
<v Speaker 3>and negative charges.</v>

283
00:14:29.861 --> 00:14:32.290
<v Speaker 3>Why?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Why does quantum mechanics hall?</v>

284
00:14:32.940 --> 00:14:33.410
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>why,</v>

285
00:14:33.450 --> 00:14:35.590
<v Speaker 3>why,</v>
<v Speaker 3>why doesn't some other theory,</v>

286
00:14:35.800 --> 00:14:38.970
<v Speaker 3>quantum mechanics in our university?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's very unclear why so tiller,</v>

287
00:14:39.010 --> 00:14:41.620
<v Speaker 3>comical question,</v>
<v Speaker 3>why questions are difficult to answer.</v>

288
00:14:41.621 --> 00:14:45.160
<v Speaker 3>Clearly there's some relationship </v>
<v Speaker 3>between complexity,</v>

289
00:14:45.340 --> 00:14:47.470
<v Speaker 3>brain processing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>power and consciousness,</v>

290
00:14:48.640 --> 00:14:50.380
<v Speaker 3>but however,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in these cases,</v>

291
00:14:50.381 --> 00:14:54.320
<v Speaker 3>in these three that I gave,</v>
<v Speaker 3>one is an everyday experience at night.</v>

292
00:14:54.321 --> 00:14:57.320
<v Speaker 3>The other one is a tom on third one is </v>
<v Speaker 3>in principle.</v>

293
00:14:57.321 --> 00:15:02.321
<v Speaker 3>You can.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Everybody can have these sort of </v>

294
00:15:02.321 --> 00:15:03.860
<v Speaker 3>mystical experiences.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You have a dissociation of function form</v>

295
00:15:03.950 --> 00:15:05.870
<v Speaker 3>of intelligence from</v>

296
00:15:06.450 --> 00:15:11.450
<v Speaker 1>I'm from conscious and unconscious.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This you caught me asking a why </v>

297
00:15:11.450 --> 00:15:15.590
<v Speaker 1>question.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let me ask a question that's not a why </v>

298
00:15:15.590 --> 00:15:19.071
<v Speaker 1>question.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're giving a talk later today on the </v>

299
00:15:19.071 --> 00:15:21.180
<v Speaker 1>turing test for intelligence and causes </v>
<v Speaker 1>a drawn lines between the two.</v>

300
00:15:21.181 --> 00:15:26.181
<v Speaker 1>So is there a scientific way to say </v>
<v Speaker 1>there's consciousness present in this </v>

301
00:15:26.181 --> 00:15:30.921
<v Speaker 1>entity or not?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And to anticipate your answer because </v>

302
00:15:31.110 --> 00:15:33.930
<v Speaker 1>you will also.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a neuro biological answer.</v>

303
00:15:34.110 --> 00:15:37.500
<v Speaker 1>So we test the human brain,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but if you take a machine brain that you</v>

304
00:15:37.501 --> 00:15:42.501
<v Speaker 1>don't know tests for yet a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how would you even begin to approach a </v>

305
00:15:43.171 --> 00:15:45.900
<v Speaker 1>test of their consciousness precedent in</v>
<v Speaker 1>this thing?</v>

306
00:15:46.310 --> 00:15:47.660
<v Speaker 3>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's a really good question.</v>

307
00:15:47.661 --> 00:15:52.661
<v Speaker 3>So let me take two steps.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So as you point out for for four months,</v>

308
00:15:53.111 --> 00:15:56.580
<v Speaker 3>let's just stick with humans.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's now a test called a zap unzip.</v>

309
00:15:56.600 --> 00:16:01.600
<v Speaker 3>It's a procedure where you ping the </v>
<v Speaker 3>brain using transcranial magnetic </v>

310
00:16:01.600 --> 00:16:04.781
<v Speaker 3>stimulation,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you look at the electrical </v>

311
00:16:04.781 --> 00:16:07.331
<v Speaker 3>reverberations essentially using egg and</v>
<v Speaker 3>then you can measure the complexity of </v>

312
00:16:07.331 --> 00:16:08.890
<v Speaker 3>this brain response and you can do this </v>
<v Speaker 3>in a weight.</v>

313
00:16:08.891 --> 00:16:10.790
<v Speaker 3>People in asleep sleep,</v>
<v Speaker 3>normal people.</v>

314
00:16:10.791 --> 00:16:13.670
<v Speaker 3>You can do it in a wake people up and </v>
<v Speaker 3>then anesthetize them.</v>

315
00:16:13.671 --> 00:16:18.671
<v Speaker 3>you can do it in patients and it it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it has a hundred percent accuracy that </v>

316
00:16:18.790 --> 00:16:23.790
<v Speaker 3>in all those cases when you're clear the</v>
<v Speaker 3>patient or the person that either </v>

317
00:16:23.790 --> 00:16:26.801
<v Speaker 3>conscious or unconscious a complexity </v>
<v Speaker 3>either high or low and then you can </v>

318
00:16:26.801 --> 00:16:28.420
<v Speaker 3>adopt these techniques to similar </v>
<v Speaker 3>creatures like monkeys and dogs and,</v>

319
00:16:28.421 --> 00:16:30.920
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and mindset have very similar planes.</v>

320
00:16:31.970 --> 00:16:36.970
<v Speaker 3>Now of course you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you point out that may not help you </v>

321
00:16:36.970 --> 00:16:36.970
<v Speaker 3>because we don't have a context,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

322
00:16:36.970 --> 00:16:39.650
<v Speaker 3>and if I send them magnetic pulse into </v>
<v Speaker 3>my iphone or my computer,</v>

323
00:16:39.651 --> 00:16:41.040
<v Speaker 3>it's probably going to break something.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

324
00:16:41.360 --> 00:16:43.010
<v Speaker 3>So we don't have that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>so what we need,</v>

325
00:16:43.040 --> 00:16:43.820
<v Speaker 3>ultimately,</v>

326
00:16:45.310 --> 00:16:49.240
<v Speaker 3>we need a theory of consciousness.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We can just align our intuition,</v>

327
00:16:49.241 --> 00:16:50.440
<v Speaker 3>our intuition as well.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

328
00:16:50.441 --> 00:16:52.570
<v Speaker 3>If somebody talks,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're conscious,</v>

329
00:16:52.830 --> 00:16:53.620
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>However,</v>

330
00:16:53.621 --> 00:16:56.170
<v Speaker 3>then they all these children,</v>
<v Speaker 3>babies don't talk.</v>

331
00:16:56.200 --> 00:16:58.180
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>But we believe that that,</v>

332
00:16:58.270 --> 00:17:00.640
<v Speaker 3>that baby's also have conscious </v>
<v Speaker 3>experiences.</v>

333
00:17:00.641 --> 00:17:05.641
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then there are all these patients I </v>

334
00:17:05.641 --> 00:17:05.641
<v Speaker 3>mentioned and they don't talk.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When you dream,</v>

335
00:17:05.641 --> 00:17:07.300
<v Speaker 3>you can't talk because you're paralyzed.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So.</v>

336
00:17:07.630 --> 00:17:09.100
<v Speaker 3>So what?</v>
<v Speaker 3>What we ultimately need,</v>

337
00:17:09.130 --> 00:17:14.130
<v Speaker 3>we can't just rely on our intuition.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We need a theory of content that tells </v>

338
00:17:14.130 --> 00:17:18.151
<v Speaker 3>us what is it about a piece of matter?</v>
<v Speaker 3>What is it about a piece of highly </v>

339
00:17:18.151 --> 00:17:19.750
<v Speaker 3>excitable map?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I like the brain or like a computer that</v>

340
00:17:19.751 --> 00:17:22.480
<v Speaker 3>gives rise to conscious experience.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We all believe,</v>

341
00:17:22.510 --> 00:17:24.280
<v Speaker 3>none of us believe that anymore in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>old story.</v>

342
00:17:24.281 --> 00:17:29.281
<v Speaker 3>It's a soul that used to be the most </v>
<v Speaker 3>common explanation that most people </v>

343
00:17:29.281 --> 00:17:29.281
<v Speaker 3>accept it.</v>

344
00:17:29.281 --> 00:17:32.010
<v Speaker 3>And still a lot of people today believe,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well there's god endowed.</v>

345
00:17:32.110 --> 00:17:35.350
<v Speaker 3>Only asked was his special thing that </v>
<v Speaker 3>animals don't have.</v>

346
00:17:35.380 --> 00:17:36.700
<v Speaker 3>They need to call.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Famously said,</v>

347
00:17:36.910 --> 00:17:38.380
<v Speaker 3>dog,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you hit it with your,</v>

348
00:17:38.381 --> 00:17:41.800
<v Speaker 3>catch me yell at me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it doesn't have this special thing.</v>

349
00:17:41.801 --> 00:17:43.720
<v Speaker 3>It doesn't have the magic,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the magic sauce.</v>

350
00:17:44.920 --> 00:17:49.920
<v Speaker 3>It doesn't have guys downstairs.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So now we believe that isn't the case </v>

351
00:17:49.920 --> 00:17:51.720
<v Speaker 3>anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So what is the difference between brains</v>

352
00:17:51.810 --> 00:17:53.520
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and these guys?</v>

353
00:17:53.580 --> 00:17:58.580
<v Speaker 3>Silicon and um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in particular once their behavior </v>

354
00:17:58.580 --> 00:17:59.100
<v Speaker 3>matches.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So if you have siri,</v>

355
00:17:59.101 --> 00:18:04.101
<v Speaker 3>you have alexa in 20 years from now that</v>
<v Speaker 3>she can talk just as good as any </v>

356
00:18:04.101 --> 00:18:05.970
<v Speaker 3>possible schumann,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what counts do you have to say?</v>

357
00:18:06.090 --> 00:18:08.200
<v Speaker 3>She's not conscious in particular.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If she says,</v>

358
00:18:08.201 --> 00:18:11.950
<v Speaker 3>as I've caught,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you will cause I'm conscious you also,</v>

359
00:18:11.960 --> 00:18:13.080
<v Speaker 3>what are you doing?</v>
<v Speaker 3>and she'll say,</v>

360
00:18:13.081 --> 00:18:13.950
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

361
00:18:14.030 --> 00:18:17.260
<v Speaker 3>they,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they'll generate some way to cost she,</v>

362
00:18:17.300 --> 00:18:19.380
<v Speaker 3>she'll behave like a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like a person.</v>

363
00:18:19.770 --> 00:18:22.170
<v Speaker 3>Now there's several differences.</v>
<v Speaker 3>One is,</v>

364
00:18:23.490 --> 00:18:26.110
<v Speaker 3>so this relates to the problem,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the very hot.</v>

365
00:18:26.200 --> 00:18:30.150
<v Speaker 3>Why is consciousness a hard problem?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's because it's subjective,</v>

366
00:18:30.210 --> 00:18:32.180
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Only I have it for one.</v>

367
00:18:32.220 --> 00:18:36.120
<v Speaker 3>I know I have direct experience of my </v>
<v Speaker 3>own consciousness.</v>

368
00:18:36.510 --> 00:18:38.940
<v Speaker 3>I don't have eczema.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And your consciousness now,</v>

369
00:18:38.941 --> 00:18:43.941
<v Speaker 3>I assume as a sort of a bayesian </v>
<v Speaker 3>personal believes in probability theory </v>

370
00:18:43.941 --> 00:18:43.941
<v Speaker 3>in all of that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

371
00:18:43.941 --> 00:18:45.180
<v Speaker 3>I can do,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I can do an abduction to the,</v>

372
00:18:45.210 --> 00:18:48.870
<v Speaker 3>to the best available tax I did use.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Your brain is very similar to mine.</v>

373
00:18:48.871 --> 00:18:53.871
<v Speaker 3>If I put you in a scanner,</v>
<v Speaker 3>your brain is going to behave the same </v>

374
00:18:53.871 --> 00:18:53.871
<v Speaker 3>with I do.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If,</v>

375
00:18:53.871 --> 00:18:54.070
<v Speaker 3>if,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you know,</v>

376
00:18:54.090 --> 00:18:56.430
<v Speaker 3>if I gave you this muesli and ask you </v>
<v Speaker 3>how does it taste?</v>

377
00:18:56.431 --> 00:18:58.020
<v Speaker 3>You tell me things that you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>

378
00:18:58.350 --> 00:19:00.210
<v Speaker 3>that I would also say more or less </v>
<v Speaker 3>higher.</v>

379
00:19:00.360 --> 00:19:03.150
<v Speaker 3>So infer based on all of them that your </v>
<v Speaker 3>conscious now it was silly.</v>

380
00:19:03.151 --> 00:19:08.151
<v Speaker 3>I can't do that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So there I really need a theory that </v>

381
00:19:08.151 --> 00:19:09.090
<v Speaker 3>tells me what is it about,</v>
<v Speaker 3>about any system,</v>

382
00:19:09.091 --> 00:19:10.740
<v Speaker 3>this or this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It makes it conscious.</v>

383
00:19:11.140 --> 00:19:12.450
<v Speaker 3>We have such a theory.</v>

384
00:19:12.530 --> 00:19:15.020
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the integrated information theory,</v>

385
00:19:15.680 --> 00:19:20.680
<v Speaker 1>but let me first maybe as an </v>
<v Speaker 1>introduction for people who are not </v>

386
00:19:20.680 --> 00:19:20.680
<v Speaker 1>familiar,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the car.</v>

387
00:19:20.720 --> 00:19:25.720
<v Speaker 1>Can yOu talk a lot about panpsychism?</v>
<v Speaker 1>can you describe what a physicalism </v>

388
00:19:27.710 --> 00:19:29.380
<v Speaker 1>versus dualism?</v>
<v Speaker 1>The.</v>

389
00:19:29.510 --> 00:19:33.230
<v Speaker 1>You mentioned the soul.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What is the history of that idea?</v>

390
00:19:33.330 --> 00:19:36.240
<v Speaker 1>What is the idea of penn psychosis or.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

391
00:19:36.290 --> 00:19:41.290
<v Speaker 1>the debate really out of which </v>
<v Speaker 1>panpsychism can emerge of,</v>

392
00:19:41.390 --> 00:19:42.250
<v Speaker 1>of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of,</v>

393
00:19:42.251 --> 00:19:47.251
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>dualism versus a physicalism or do you </v>

394
00:19:47.251 --> 00:19:49.400
<v Speaker 1>not see a panpsychism as fitting into </v>
<v Speaker 1>that?</v>

395
00:19:49.840 --> 00:19:51.630
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can argue there's some older.</v>

396
00:19:51.660 --> 00:19:52.570
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So let's step back.</v>

397
00:19:52.571 --> 00:19:57.571
<v Speaker 3>So panpsychism is a very ancient belief </v>
<v Speaker 3>that's been around a plato and aristotle</v>

398
00:19:57.910 --> 00:20:01.000
<v Speaker 3>talks about it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>A modern philosophers talk about it.</v>

399
00:20:01.480 --> 00:20:04.930
<v Speaker 3>Of course in buddhism the idea is very </v>
<v Speaker 3>prevalent that,</v>

400
00:20:05.160 --> 00:20:10.160
<v Speaker 3>I mean the different versions of it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>one version says everything is </v>

401
00:20:10.160 --> 00:20:10.160
<v Speaker 3>installed.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Everything,</v>

402
00:20:10.160 --> 00:20:13.030
<v Speaker 3>rocks and stones and dogs and people and</v>
<v Speaker 3>foremost an iphone.</v>

403
00:20:13.060 --> 00:20:14.560
<v Speaker 3>All of her soul.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'd all,</v>

404
00:20:14.570 --> 00:20:16.690
<v Speaker 3>matt is in seoul.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's sort of one version.</v>

405
00:20:16.870 --> 00:20:21.870
<v Speaker 3>Another version is that all biology,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all creatures smaller,</v>

406
00:20:22.061 --> 00:20:27.061
<v Speaker 3>large from a single cell to a giant </v>
<v Speaker 3>quietly feel like something that's the </v>

407
00:20:27.061 --> 00:20:28.750
<v Speaker 3>one I think is somewhat more realistic.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

408
00:20:29.140 --> 00:20:31.390
<v Speaker 3>so they're different.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What do you mean by feel like something?</v>

409
00:20:31.470 --> 00:20:34.370
<v Speaker 3>I have a feeling,</v>
<v Speaker 3>have some kind of like,</v>

410
00:20:34.490 --> 00:20:39.490
<v Speaker 3>some,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it may well be possible that it feels </v>

411
00:20:39.490 --> 00:20:39.490
<v Speaker 3>like something to be a power medium.</v>

412
00:20:39.490 --> 00:20:43.810
<v Speaker 3>I think it's pretty likely it feels like</v>
<v Speaker 3>something to be a b or a mouse or dog.</v>

413
00:20:45.500 --> 00:20:46.160
<v Speaker 3>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

414
00:20:46.161 --> 00:20:47.150
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so,</v>

415
00:20:47.170 --> 00:20:52.170
<v Speaker 3>so that you can see that's also.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So pam is very broad and you can some </v>

416
00:20:52.421 --> 00:20:53.740
<v Speaker 3>people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for example,</v>

417
00:20:53.770 --> 00:20:58.770
<v Speaker 3>a proton mccastle try to advocate this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This idea is called alien monism that,</v>

418
00:21:00.220 --> 00:21:04.060
<v Speaker 3>that panpsychism is really physics </v>
<v Speaker 3>viewed from the inside.</v>

419
00:21:05.080 --> 00:21:09.790
<v Speaker 3>So the idea is that physics is very good</v>
<v Speaker 3>at describing relationship among objects</v>

420
00:21:09.791 --> 00:21:13.150
<v Speaker 3>like charges or like gravity,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

421
00:21:13.240 --> 00:21:16.150
<v Speaker 3>this relationship between curvature and </v>
<v Speaker 3>mass distribution.</v>

422
00:21:16.151 --> 00:21:17.890
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's the relationship among things.</v>

423
00:21:18.130 --> 00:21:20.920
<v Speaker 3>Physics doesn't really discard the </v>
<v Speaker 3>ultimate reality itself.</v>

424
00:21:20.921 --> 00:21:25.490
<v Speaker 3>It's just relationship among quarks or </v>
<v Speaker 3>all these other stuff was sort of like a</v>

425
00:21:25.590 --> 00:21:28.150
<v Speaker 3>third observer.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>

426
00:21:28.990 --> 00:21:33.990
<v Speaker 3>And consciousness is what physics feels </v>
<v Speaker 3>on the inside to my conscious </v>

427
00:21:33.990 --> 00:21:35.800
<v Speaker 3>experience.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a way that physics of my brain,</v>

428
00:21:35.801 --> 00:21:37.930
<v Speaker 3>particular my cortex feels from the </v>
<v Speaker 3>inside.</v>

429
00:21:38.500 --> 00:21:42.090
<v Speaker 3>And so if you meet them,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you to remember you say panamanian,</v>

430
00:21:42.100 --> 00:21:47.100
<v Speaker 3>well that's a pretty dumb creature this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it has already a billion different </v>

431
00:21:47.100 --> 00:21:48.920
<v Speaker 3>molecules probably,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

432
00:21:48.970 --> 00:21:51.790
<v Speaker 3>5,000</v>
<v Speaker 3>different proteins assemble in a highly,</v>

433
00:21:51.791 --> 00:21:54.310
<v Speaker 3>highly complex system that no single </v>
<v Speaker 3>person,</v>

434
00:21:54.311 --> 00:21:59.311
<v Speaker 3>no computer system so far on this planet</v>
<v Speaker 3>has ever managed to accurately simulate </v>

435
00:21:59.311 --> 00:22:00.940
<v Speaker 3>its complexity.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Vastly escapes us.</v>

436
00:22:01.210 --> 00:22:06.210
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it may well be that that little </v>

437
00:22:06.210 --> 00:22:06.210
<v Speaker 3>thing feels like a tiny bit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

438
00:22:06.210 --> 00:22:06.520
<v Speaker 3>it doesn't have a voice in their head </v>
<v Speaker 3>like me.</v>

439
00:22:06.521 --> 00:22:08.530
<v Speaker 3>It doesn't have expectations,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

440
00:22:08.531 --> 00:22:12.370
<v Speaker 3>it doesn't have all that complex things,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it may well feel like something.</v>

441
00:22:12.490 --> 00:22:14.260
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So This is really interesting.</v>

442
00:22:14.680 --> 00:22:19.680
<v Speaker 3>Can we draw some lines and maybe try to </v>
<v Speaker 3>understand the difference between life </v>

443
00:22:20.200 --> 00:22:24.790
<v Speaker 3>intelligence and consciousness.</v>
<v Speaker 3>How do you see all of those?</v>

444
00:22:25.160 --> 00:22:28.360
<v Speaker 3>If she has to define what is a living </v>
<v Speaker 3>thing,</v>

445
00:22:28.510 --> 00:22:31.480
<v Speaker 3>what is a conscious thing and what is an</v>
<v Speaker 3>intelligent thing?</v>

446
00:22:31.480 --> 00:22:34.800
<v Speaker 3>Do those intermix for you?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Or are they totally separate or.</v>

447
00:22:34.801 --> 00:22:35.340
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So a,</v>

448
00:22:35.370 --> 00:22:37.240
<v Speaker 3>that's a question that we don't have a </v>
<v Speaker 3>full.</v>

449
00:22:37.330 --> 00:22:41.110
<v Speaker 3>And a lot of this stuff we're talking </v>
<v Speaker 3>about today is full of mysteries.</v>

450
00:22:41.111 --> 00:22:42.540
<v Speaker 3>And fascinating ones,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right it,</v>

451
00:22:42.541 --> 00:22:47.541
<v Speaker 3>while the approximately you can go to </v>
<v Speaker 3>other startle who's probably the most </v>

452
00:22:47.541 --> 00:22:48.220
<v Speaker 3>important scientists and philosophers </v>
<v Speaker 3>ever lived in.</v>

453
00:22:48.250 --> 00:22:50.680
<v Speaker 3>Certainly in western culture.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He had this idea,</v>

454
00:22:50.681 --> 00:22:53.760
<v Speaker 3>it's called hylomorphism.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's quite popular these days that there</v>

455
00:22:53.761 --> 00:22:56.770
<v Speaker 3>are different forms of soul.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The soul is really the form of something</v>

456
00:22:56.771 --> 00:22:57.880
<v Speaker 3>he saw.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He says,</v>

457
00:22:58.210 --> 00:23:03.210
<v Speaker 3>all biological kj have a vegetive soul.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's life principle today we think we </v>

458
00:23:03.210 --> 00:23:07.561
<v Speaker 3>understand something molded it's </v>
<v Speaker 3>biochemistry and nonlinear </v>

459
00:23:07.561 --> 00:23:07.561
<v Speaker 3>thermodynamics,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

460
00:23:07.561 --> 00:23:12.240
<v Speaker 3>Then he said they have a sensitive,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so only animals and humans have also a </v>

461
00:23:12.240 --> 00:23:15.670
<v Speaker 3>sensitive soul or an appetitive soul.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They can see,</v>

462
00:23:15.671 --> 00:23:17.890
<v Speaker 3>they can smell and they have drives.</v>

463
00:23:18.160 --> 00:23:19.100
<v Speaker 3>They wanted tO put,</v>
<v Speaker 3>reproduce,</v>

464
00:23:19.140 --> 00:23:20.510
<v Speaker 3>they want to eat,</v>
<v Speaker 3>et cetera,</v>

465
00:23:20.860 --> 00:23:24.220
<v Speaker 3>and then only humans have what he called</v>
<v Speaker 3>a rational soul.</v>

466
00:23:25.090 --> 00:23:30.090
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that idea that made it into </v>

467
00:23:30.090 --> 00:23:30.760
<v Speaker 3>christian dome and then the rational </v>
<v Speaker 3>soul is the one that lives forever.</v>

468
00:23:30.761 --> 00:23:32.350
<v Speaker 3>He was very unclear.</v>
<v Speaker 3>he wasn't really,</v>

469
00:23:32.740 --> 00:23:37.740
<v Speaker 3>I mean different readings or virustotal </v>
<v Speaker 3>give different what that did he believe </v>

470
00:23:37.740 --> 00:23:38.140
<v Speaker 3>that international show was a model or </v>
<v Speaker 3>not,</v>

471
00:23:38.141 --> 00:23:43.141
<v Speaker 3>but I probably think he didn't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but then of course had made it into a </v>

472
00:23:43.141 --> 00:23:46.310
<v Speaker 3>play to under christianity and then this</v>
<v Speaker 3>all became immortal and then became the </v>

473
00:23:46.310 --> 00:23:48.220
<v Speaker 3>the connection to god.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now you,</v>

474
00:23:48.350 --> 00:23:51.860
<v Speaker 3>so you were asking me essentially,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what does our modern conception of these</v>

475
00:23:51.920 --> 00:23:56.780
<v Speaker 3>fleet aristotle would have called them </v>
<v Speaker 3>different forms live.</v>

476
00:23:56.810 --> 00:23:59.850
<v Speaker 3>We think we know something about it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>at least live on this planet,</v>

477
00:24:00.050 --> 00:24:01.880
<v Speaker 3>although we don't understand how to </v>
<v Speaker 3>originated,</v>

478
00:24:01.881 --> 00:24:04.820
<v Speaker 3>but it's been difficult to rigorously </v>
<v Speaker 3>pin down.</v>

479
00:24:05.210 --> 00:24:07.450
<v Speaker 3>You see this in modern definition of </v>
<v Speaker 3>death.</v>

480
00:24:08.210 --> 00:24:11.120
<v Speaker 3>It's the fact that I had.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now there's a conference ongoing.</v>

481
00:24:11.180 --> 00:24:16.180
<v Speaker 3>Again,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that ties to defined legally and </v>

482
00:24:16.180 --> 00:24:16.180
<v Speaker 3>medically.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What is death?</v>

483
00:24:16.180 --> 00:24:17.720
<v Speaker 3>It used to be very simple.</v>
<v Speaker 3>As you stop breathing,</v>

484
00:24:17.721 --> 00:24:21.150
<v Speaker 3>your heart stops beating your dad.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Totally unconverted lead.</v>

485
00:24:21.510 --> 00:24:23.450
<v Speaker 3>If you're unsure you wait another 10 </v>
<v Speaker 3>minutes.</v>

486
00:24:23.451 --> 00:24:25.220
<v Speaker 3>If the patient doesn't please,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know he's dead.</v>

487
00:24:25.400 --> 00:24:27.050
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>now we have ventilators.</v>

488
00:24:27.230 --> 00:24:29.990
<v Speaker 3>We have half of a peacemaker,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so it's much more difficult to define.</v>

489
00:24:29.991 --> 00:24:34.991
<v Speaker 3>What this is typically does is defined </v>
<v Speaker 3>at the end of life and life has defined </v>

490
00:24:35.010 --> 00:24:36.920
<v Speaker 3>before death before that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

491
00:24:36.921 --> 00:24:38.930
<v Speaker 3>So we don't have really very good </v>
<v Speaker 3>definitions.</v>

492
00:24:39.320 --> 00:24:41.780
<v Speaker 3>Intelligence,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we don't have a rigorous definition.</v>

493
00:24:41.781 --> 00:24:46.240
<v Speaker 3>We know something how to measure it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>called iq or gi factors hide and,</v>

494
00:24:46.270 --> 00:24:50.020
<v Speaker 3>and we're beginning to build it in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in a narrow sense.</v>

495
00:24:50.021 --> 00:24:51.940
<v Speaker 3>I'd like go alphago and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>

496
00:24:51.970 --> 00:24:54.110
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and watson and you know,</v>

497
00:24:54.470 --> 00:24:56.690
<v Speaker 3>google cars and uber cars and all of </v>
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>

498
00:24:56.691 --> 00:25:01.691
<v Speaker 3>That's still now I am.</v>
<v Speaker 3>some people are thinking about </v>

499
00:25:01.691 --> 00:25:02.420
<v Speaker 3>artificial general intelligence,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but actually as we've said before,</v>

500
00:25:02.421 --> 00:25:06.200
<v Speaker 3>it's something to do with ability to </v>
<v Speaker 3>learn and to adapt to new environments.</v>

501
00:25:06.470 --> 00:25:07.730
<v Speaker 3>But that is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>as I said,</v>

502
00:25:07.731 --> 00:25:12.731
<v Speaker 3>also,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's radical difference from experience </v>

503
00:25:12.731 --> 00:25:14.660
<v Speaker 3>and it's very unclear if you build a </v>
<v Speaker 3>machine that has agi,</v>

504
00:25:14.690 --> 00:25:19.690
<v Speaker 3>it's not at all,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not at all clear that this machine will </v>

505
00:25:19.690 --> 00:25:20.420
<v Speaker 3>have consciousness.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It may or may not.</v>

506
00:25:20.660 --> 00:25:22.100
<v Speaker 3>So let's ask it the other way.</v>

507
00:25:22.280 --> 00:25:27.280
<v Speaker 1>Do you think if you were to try to build</v>
<v Speaker 1>an artificial general intelligence </v>

508
00:25:27.280 --> 00:25:27.280
<v Speaker 1>system,</v>
<v Speaker 1>can you think,</v>

509
00:25:28.030 --> 00:25:33.030
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>figuring out how to build artificial </v>

510
00:25:33.030 --> 00:25:34.650
<v Speaker 1>consciousness?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What would help you get to an agi?</v>

511
00:25:34.830 --> 00:25:39.830
<v Speaker 1>So or put another way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do you think intelligent requires </v>

512
00:25:39.830 --> 00:25:42.600
<v Speaker 1>consciousness in shumen it goes hand in </v>
<v Speaker 1>hand</v>

513
00:25:43.050 --> 00:25:44.820
<v Speaker 3>in shumen or.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think in biology,</v>

514
00:25:44.821 --> 00:25:47.400
<v Speaker 3>consciousness and intelligence goes hand</v>
<v Speaker 3>in hand.</v>

515
00:25:47.580 --> 00:25:51.900
<v Speaker 3>Quite is illusion because the plane </v>
<v Speaker 3>evolved to be highly complex.</v>

516
00:25:51.901 --> 00:25:55.680
<v Speaker 3>Complexity via this theory,</v>
<v Speaker 3>integrated information theory is sort of</v>

517
00:25:55.681 --> 00:25:58.950
<v Speaker 3>ultimately is what is closely tied to </v>
<v Speaker 3>consciousness.</v>

518
00:25:59.250 --> 00:26:04.250
<v Speaker 3>Ultimately it's causal power upon itself</v>
<v Speaker 3>and so in evolution evolved systems ego </v>

519
00:26:04.250 --> 00:26:07.710
<v Speaker 3>together in artificial system,</v>
<v Speaker 3>particularly in digital machines,</v>

520
00:26:07.740 --> 00:26:09.960
<v Speaker 3>they do not go together and if you ask </v>
<v Speaker 3>me,</v>

521
00:26:09.961 --> 00:26:13.620
<v Speaker 3>point blank is alexa 20 point,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

522
00:26:13.630 --> 00:26:15.480
<v Speaker 3>in the year 20,</v>
<v Speaker 3>41,</v>

523
00:26:15.481 --> 00:26:17.470
<v Speaker 3>she can easily pass every two </v>
<v Speaker 3>intestines.</v>

524
00:26:17.490 --> 00:26:20.540
<v Speaker 3>She conscious no.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Even if she claims she's concert.</v>

525
00:26:21.000 --> 00:26:26.000
<v Speaker 3>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you could even do more radical version </v>

526
00:26:26.000 --> 00:26:27.861
<v Speaker 3>of this thought experiment.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We can build a computer simulation of </v>

527
00:26:27.861 --> 00:26:31.041
<v Speaker 3>the human brain.</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know what henry markram in the blue </v>

528
00:26:31.041 --> 00:26:31.230
<v Speaker 3>brain project or the human brain project</v>
<v Speaker 3>in Switzerland,</v>

529
00:26:31.231 --> 00:26:36.231
<v Speaker 3>it's kind of do them all the success.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So in 10 years we have this perfect </v>

530
00:26:36.231 --> 00:26:36.480
<v Speaker 3>simulation of the human brain.</v>

531
00:26:36.510 --> 00:26:40.380
<v Speaker 3>Every new owner stimulated and it has </v>
<v Speaker 3>alarm makes and it has motor neuron.</v>

532
00:26:40.381 --> 00:26:44.040
<v Speaker 3>It has a pocket area and of course talk </v>
<v Speaker 3>and they'll say,</v>

533
00:26:44.041 --> 00:26:45.480
<v Speaker 3>hi,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just woke up.</v>

534
00:26:45.481 --> 00:26:46.370
<v Speaker 3>I feel great.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

535
00:26:46.590 --> 00:26:51.590
<v Speaker 3>Even that computer simulation that can </v>
<v Speaker 3>imprint so map onto your brain will not </v>

536
00:26:51.590 --> 00:26:52.050
<v Speaker 3>be conscious.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Why?</v>

537
00:26:52.140 --> 00:26:55.020
<v Speaker 3>Because it simulates.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a difference between this simulated</v>

538
00:26:55.021 --> 00:26:58.560
<v Speaker 3>in the real,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so it simulates the behavior salted with</v>

539
00:26:58.561 --> 00:26:59.850
<v Speaker 3>consciousness.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It might be,</v>

540
00:27:00.210 --> 00:27:01.470
<v Speaker 3>it will.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If it's done properly,</v>

541
00:27:01.471 --> 00:27:06.471
<v Speaker 3>we'll have all the intelligence that </v>
<v Speaker 3>that particular person they're </v>

542
00:27:06.471 --> 00:27:07.800
<v Speaker 3>simulating has,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but simulating intelligence,</v>

543
00:27:07.830 --> 00:27:11.820
<v Speaker 3>it's not the same as having conscious </v>
<v Speaker 3>experiences and I give you a really nice</v>

544
00:27:11.821 --> 00:27:14.340
<v Speaker 3>metaphor that engineers and physicists </v>
<v Speaker 3>typically get.</v>

545
00:27:15.240 --> 00:27:20.240
<v Speaker 3>I can write down einStein's field </v>
<v Speaker 3>equations nine or 10 equations that </v>

546
00:27:20.240 --> 00:27:22.950
<v Speaker 3>describe the lincoln general relativity </v>
<v Speaker 3>between curvature and and mass.</v>

547
00:27:23.430 --> 00:27:28.430
<v Speaker 3>I can do that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I can run this on my laptop to to </v>

548
00:27:28.430 --> 00:27:32.090
<v Speaker 3>predict that the sample,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the black hole at the center of our </v>

549
00:27:32.090 --> 00:27:35.301
<v Speaker 3>galaxy will be so massive that it twists</v>
<v Speaker 3>space time around it so no light can </v>

550
00:27:36.421 --> 00:27:36.920
<v Speaker 3>escape it.</v>

551
00:27:36.940 --> 00:27:39.060
<v Speaker 3>It'S a black hole,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but funny.</v>

552
00:27:39.090 --> 00:27:44.090
<v Speaker 3>have you ever wondered,</v>
<v Speaker 3>why doesn't this computer simulation </v>

553
00:27:44.090 --> 00:27:46.050
<v Speaker 3>suck me in ict?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It simulates gravity,</v>

554
00:27:46.200 --> 00:27:48.870
<v Speaker 3>but it doesn't have the causal power of </v>
<v Speaker 3>gravity.</v>

555
00:27:48.900 --> 00:27:53.900
<v Speaker 3>IT's a huge difference.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it's a difference between the real </v>

556
00:27:53.900 --> 00:27:57.830
<v Speaker 3>and the simulator,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just like it doesn't get wet inside the </v>

557
00:27:57.830 --> 00:28:00.951
<v Speaker 3>computer when the computer code that </v>
<v Speaker 3>similar to weather a storm and so in </v>

558
00:28:00.951 --> 00:28:02.920
<v Speaker 3>order to have to have artificial </v>
<v Speaker 3>continents,</v>

559
00:28:02.930 --> 00:28:06.450
<v Speaker 3>you have to give it the same.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Causal powers is human brain.</v>

560
00:28:06.790 --> 00:28:11.790
<v Speaker 3>You have to build,</v>
<v Speaker 3>took all the new amorphic machine that </v>

561
00:28:11.790 --> 00:28:12.480
<v Speaker 3>has hardware that is very similar to the</v>
<v Speaker 3>human brain,</v>

562
00:28:12.481 --> 00:28:13.440
<v Speaker 3>not a digital</v>

563
00:28:14.460 --> 00:28:18.270
<v Speaker 1>clark for nine computer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's just to clarify thouGh,</v>

564
00:28:19.140 --> 00:28:24.140
<v Speaker 1>you think that consciousness is not </v>
<v Speaker 1>required to create human level </v>

565
00:28:24.661 --> 00:28:29.661
<v Speaker 1>intelligence.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It seems to accompany in the human </v>

566
00:28:29.661 --> 00:28:30.750
<v Speaker 1>brain,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but for machine not have court.</v>

567
00:28:31.650 --> 00:28:36.650
<v Speaker 1>So maybe just because this is agi.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's dig in a little bit about what we </v>

568
00:28:37.501 --> 00:28:41.980
<v Speaker 1>mean by intelligence.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So one thing is the g factor,</v>

569
00:28:42.030 --> 00:28:47.030
<v Speaker 1>these kinds of iq tests of intelligence,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I think if you maybe another way to </v>

570
00:28:47.030 --> 00:28:48.120
<v Speaker 1>say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so in 20,</v>

571
00:28:48.130 --> 00:28:48.720
<v Speaker 1>40,</v>
<v Speaker 1>20,</v>

572
00:28:48.721 --> 00:28:53.700
<v Speaker 1>50 people have siri that is just really </v>
<v Speaker 1>impressive.</v>

573
00:28:54.750 --> 00:28:57.120
<v Speaker 1>Do you Think people will say series </v>
<v Speaker 1>intelligent?</v>

574
00:28:57.630 --> 00:28:59.100
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Intelligence.</v>

575
00:28:59.101 --> 00:29:03.090
<v Speaker 1>Is this a morphous thing?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So to be intelligent,</v>

576
00:29:03.091 --> 00:29:08.091
<v Speaker 1>it seems like you have to have some kind</v>
<v Speaker 1>of connections with other human beings </v>

577
00:29:08.091 --> 00:29:12.110
<v Speaker 1>in a sense that you have to impress them</v>
<v Speaker 1>with your intelligence and their fields.</v>

578
00:29:12.840 --> 00:29:17.840
<v Speaker 1>You have to somehow operate in this </v>
<v Speaker 1>world full of humans and for that there </v>

579
00:29:18.181 --> 00:29:21.030
<v Speaker 1>feels like there has to be something </v>
<v Speaker 1>like consciousness.</v>

580
00:29:21.690 --> 00:29:25.620
<v Speaker 1>So you think you can have just the </v>
<v Speaker 1>world's best natural lp system,</v>

581
00:29:25.980 --> 00:29:27.960
<v Speaker 1>natural language,</v>
<v Speaker 1>understanding regeneration,</v>

582
00:29:28.140 --> 00:29:31.440
<v Speaker 1>and that will be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that will get us happy and say,</v>

583
00:29:31.441 --> 00:29:34.980
<v Speaker 1>you know what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we've created an agi happy.</v>

584
00:29:37.220 --> 00:29:42.220
<v Speaker 3>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I do believe we can get what we call </v>

585
00:29:42.220 --> 00:29:42.220
<v Speaker 3>high level functional intelligence,</v>
<v Speaker 3>sort of</v>

586
00:29:42.310 --> 00:29:42.880
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>gee,</v>

587
00:29:42.881 --> 00:29:43.510
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this,</v>

588
00:29:43.570 --> 00:29:47.320
<v Speaker 2>this fluid like intelligence that we </v>
<v Speaker 2>challenged,</v>

589
00:29:47.321 --> 00:29:50.140
<v Speaker 2>particularly the place like mit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right in,</v>

590
00:29:50.270 --> 00:29:51.280
<v Speaker 2>in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in machines.</v>

591
00:29:51.281 --> 00:29:52.210
<v Speaker 2>I see apple,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

592
00:29:52.211 --> 00:29:54.880
<v Speaker 2>reasons and I've see a lot of reason to </v>
<v Speaker 2>believe it's going to happen,</v>

593
00:29:55.170 --> 00:29:57.760
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>over the next 50 years or 30 years.</v>

594
00:29:58.160 --> 00:30:01.760
<v Speaker 1>So for beneficial ai for creating an ai </v>
<v Speaker 1>system.</v>

595
00:30:01.761 --> 00:30:06.761
<v Speaker 1>That's um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so you mentioned ethics that is </v>

596
00:30:06.761 --> 00:30:08.270
<v Speaker 1>exceptionally intelligent but also does </v>
<v Speaker 1>not do,</v>

597
00:30:08.460 --> 00:30:12.620
<v Speaker 1>does aligns its values with our values </v>
<v Speaker 1>as humanity.</v>

598
00:30:12.800 --> 00:30:14.810
<v Speaker 1>Do you think then in his consciousness,</v>

599
00:30:14.850 --> 00:30:19.850
<v Speaker 2>yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that that is a verY good </v>

600
00:30:19.850 --> 00:30:21.530
<v Speaker 2>argument that if we're concerned about </v>
<v Speaker 2>ai and the threat of ai are nick bostrom</v>

601
00:30:21.540 --> 00:30:22.480
<v Speaker 2>existentialist,</v>
<v Speaker 2>dread.</v>

602
00:30:22.800 --> 00:30:26.310
<v Speaker 2>I think having an intelligent that has </v>
<v Speaker 2>empathy,</v>

603
00:30:26.970 --> 00:30:29.430
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why do we find abusing a dog?</v>

604
00:30:29.460 --> 00:30:32.580
<v Speaker 2>Why do most of us find that upholland </v>
<v Speaker 2>abusing any animal?</v>

605
00:30:32.630 --> 00:30:34.350
<v Speaker 2>I'd.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why do we find that the holland,</v>

606
00:30:34.351 --> 00:30:36.900
<v Speaker 2>because we have this thing called </v>
<v Speaker 2>empathy,</v>

607
00:30:37.230 --> 00:30:41.460
<v Speaker 2>which if you look at the greek really </v>
<v Speaker 2>means feeling with I feel empathy.</v>

608
00:30:41.461 --> 00:30:44.550
<v Speaker 2>I have feeling with you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I see somebody else suffer.</v>

609
00:30:44.551 --> 00:30:47.430
<v Speaker 2>That isn't even my conspecific I.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not a person.</v>

610
00:30:47.730 --> 00:30:49.980
<v Speaker 2>It's not a lot,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's not my wife or my kids.</v>

611
00:30:50.040 --> 00:30:52.770
<v Speaker 2>It's a dog,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I feel naturally most of us,</v>

612
00:30:52.771 --> 00:30:57.771
<v Speaker 2>not all of us,</v>
<v Speaker 2>most of us will feel emphatic and so it </v>

613
00:30:57.771 --> 00:31:01.540
<v Speaker 2>may well be in the longterm interest of </v>
<v Speaker 2>survival of homo sapiens.</v>

614
00:31:01.541 --> 00:31:06.541
<v Speaker 2>Sapiens said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if we do build agi and it's really </v>

615
00:31:06.541 --> 00:31:09.231
<v Speaker 2>becomes very powerful that it has an </v>
<v Speaker 2>emphatic response and doesn't just </v>

616
00:31:09.720 --> 00:31:12.990
<v Speaker 2>exterminated humanity.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So as part of the full</v>

617
00:31:13.120 --> 00:31:14.680
<v Speaker 1>conscious experience,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

618
00:31:14.800 --> 00:31:19.800
<v Speaker 1>to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to create a consciousness artificial or </v>

619
00:31:19.800 --> 00:31:20.990
<v Speaker 1>in our human consciousness,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do you think fear,</v>

620
00:31:21.380 --> 00:31:24.980
<v Speaker 1>maybe we're going to get it into your </v>
<v Speaker 1>earlier days in each and so on,</v>

621
00:31:24.981 --> 00:31:28.580
<v Speaker 1>but do you think fear and suffering are </v>
<v Speaker 1>essential,</v>

622
00:31:28.990 --> 00:31:30.620
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to have consciousness?</v>

623
00:31:30.621 --> 00:31:32.840
<v Speaker 1>Do you have to have the full range of </v>
<v Speaker 1>experience to have,</v>

624
00:31:33.350 --> 00:31:38.350
<v Speaker 1>to have a system that has experienced or</v>
<v Speaker 1>can you have a system that only has a </v>

625
00:31:38.581 --> 00:31:41.460
<v Speaker 1>very particular kinds of very positive </v>
<v Speaker 1>experience?</v>

626
00:31:41.670 --> 00:31:43.750
<v Speaker 2>Look you can have in Pennsylvania,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can.</v>

627
00:31:43.950 --> 00:31:48.950
<v Speaker 2>People have done this in the vat.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Will you implanted electrodes in the </v>

628
00:31:48.950 --> 00:31:52.280
<v Speaker 2>hypothalamus,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the pleasure center of the bat and that </v>

629
00:31:52.280 --> 00:31:52.910
<v Speaker 2>stimulated sob above and beyond anything</v>
<v Speaker 2>else?</v>

630
00:31:52.911 --> 00:31:57.660
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't care about food or natural </v>
<v Speaker 2>sex or drink anymore to stimulate itself</v>

631
00:31:57.690 --> 00:32:02.690
<v Speaker 2>because it's such a pleasurable feeling.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I guess it's like an orgasm just you'll </v>

632
00:32:02.690 --> 00:32:02.870
<v Speaker 2>have,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

633
00:32:02.871 --> 00:32:07.871
<v Speaker 2>all day long.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so I see no reason why you need </v>

634
00:32:09.140 --> 00:32:11.280
<v Speaker 2>different,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why you need a great variety now.</v>

635
00:32:11.281 --> 00:32:15.940
<v Speaker 2>Clearly to survive that wouldn't work.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But if I engineered artificially,</v>

636
00:32:16.170 --> 00:32:21.170
<v Speaker 2>I don't think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think you need a great variety </v>

637
00:32:21.930 --> 00:32:26.930
<v Speaker 2>of conscious experience.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You could have just pleasure or just </v>

638
00:32:26.930 --> 00:32:28.860
<v Speaker 2>feel it might be a tablet systems,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I think that's possible,</v>

639
00:32:28.861 --> 00:32:33.120
<v Speaker 2>at least on conceptual logical can cause</v>
<v Speaker 2>any real creature,</v>

640
00:32:33.121 --> 00:32:35.300
<v Speaker 2>whether artificially engineered.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you want to give it fear,</v>

641
00:32:35.301 --> 00:32:38.310
<v Speaker 2>the fear of extinction that we all have </v>
<v Speaker 2>a.</v>

642
00:32:38.311 --> 00:32:43.311
<v Speaker 2>And you also want to give it a positive </v>
<v Speaker 2>competitive states states that it wants </v>

643
00:32:43.311 --> 00:32:44.720
<v Speaker 2>to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that you want the machine in coach to do</v>

644
00:32:44.930 --> 00:32:47.060
<v Speaker 2>because if they give the machine </v>
<v Speaker 2>positive feedback.</v>

645
00:32:47.960 --> 00:32:52.280
<v Speaker 1>So you mentioned panpsychism to jump </v>
<v Speaker 1>back a little bit,</v>

646
00:32:53.260 --> 00:32:58.260
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>everything having some kind of mental </v>

647
00:32:58.260 --> 00:32:58.260
<v Speaker 1>property,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

648
00:32:58.260 --> 00:33:02.120
<v Speaker 1>how,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how do you go from there to something </v>

649
00:33:02.120 --> 00:33:04.541
<v Speaker 1>like human consciousness?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So everything having some elements of </v>

650
00:33:04.541 --> 00:33:05.360
<v Speaker 1>consciousness to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

651
00:33:05.370 --> 00:33:07.700
<v Speaker 1>is there something special about human </v>
<v Speaker 1>consciousness?</v>

652
00:33:08.100 --> 00:33:11.540
<v Speaker 1>What's so just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not everything like a sport.</v>

653
00:33:11.960 --> 00:33:12.510
<v Speaker 1>There's no.</v>

654
00:33:13.510 --> 00:33:15.390
<v Speaker 2>The of panpsychism I think of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

655
00:33:15.410 --> 00:33:18.310
<v Speaker 2>it doesn't ski consciousness to anything</v>
<v Speaker 2>like this,</v>

656
00:33:18.311 --> 00:33:20.590
<v Speaker 2>the spoon or my liver.</v>
<v Speaker 2>However,</v>

657
00:33:20.920 --> 00:33:21.960
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it is,</v>

658
00:33:22.230 --> 00:33:27.230
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the theory of integrated information </v>

659
00:33:27.230 --> 00:33:27.230
<v Speaker 2>theory.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It does say that system,</v>

660
00:33:27.230 --> 00:33:28.810
<v Speaker 2>even ones that look from the outside,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the relatively simple,</v>

661
00:33:28.811 --> 00:33:31.060
<v Speaker 2>at least if they have this internal </v>
<v Speaker 2>calvo power,</v>

662
00:33:31.061 --> 00:33:34.780
<v Speaker 2>they are the.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It does feel like something.</v>

663
00:33:35.260 --> 00:33:40.260
<v Speaker 2>The theory I polio doesn't say anything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What's special about schumann </v>

664
00:33:40.260 --> 00:33:43.830
<v Speaker 2>biologically we know what the one thing </v>
<v Speaker 2>that's special about human is we speak </v>

665
00:33:43.830 --> 00:33:46.870
<v Speaker 2>and we have an overblown sense of our </v>
<v Speaker 2>own importance,</v>

666
00:33:47.270 --> 00:33:52.270
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Can we believe we are exceptional and </v>

667
00:33:52.270 --> 00:33:53.500
<v Speaker 2>we're just god's gift to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to into the universe,</v>

668
00:33:53.710 --> 00:33:56.020
<v Speaker 2>but the but behaviorally the main thing </v>
<v Speaker 2>that we have,</v>

669
00:33:56.021 --> 00:34:01.021
<v Speaker 2>we can plan,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we can plan or the longterm and we have </v>

670
00:34:01.021 --> 00:34:01.240
<v Speaker 2>language and that gives us enormous </v>
<v Speaker 2>amount of power.</v>

671
00:34:01.550 --> 00:34:04.870
<v Speaker 2>That's why we are the dominant species </v>
<v Speaker 2>on the planet.</v>

672
00:34:05.750 --> 00:34:09.830
<v Speaker 1>So you mentioned god,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you grew up a devout roman catholic,</v>

673
00:34:10.020 --> 00:34:15.020
<v Speaker 1>a roman catholic family.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you know what consciousness you're </v>

674
00:34:15.611 --> 00:34:20.611
<v Speaker 1>sort of exploring some really deeply </v>
<v Speaker 1>fundamental human things that religion </v>

675
00:34:21.021 --> 00:34:22.610
<v Speaker 1>also touches on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So where does,</v>

676
00:34:23.210 --> 00:34:25.850
<v Speaker 1>where does religion fit into your </v>
<v Speaker 1>thinking about consciousness and you've,</v>

677
00:34:26.840 --> 00:34:30.950
<v Speaker 1>you've grown throughout your life and </v>
<v Speaker 1>changed your views on religion as far as</v>

678
00:34:30.951 --> 00:34:31.430
<v Speaker 1>I understand.</v>

679
00:34:32.190 --> 00:34:33.840
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean I'm not much closer to.</v>

680
00:34:33.841 --> 00:34:38.841
<v Speaker 2>So I'm not a roman catholic anymore,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't believe there's sort of this </v>

681
00:34:38.841 --> 00:34:39.930
<v Speaker 2>god,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the god I was,</v>

682
00:34:40.110 --> 00:34:42.020
<v Speaker 2>I was educated to believe in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

683
00:34:42.030 --> 00:34:47.030
<v Speaker 2>sit somewhere in the fullness of time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll be united in some sort of </v>

684
00:34:47.030 --> 00:34:49.470
<v Speaker 2>everlasting bliss.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just don't see any evidence for that.</v>

685
00:34:50.100 --> 00:34:52.260
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the world the night is large and full of</v>

686
00:34:52.280 --> 00:34:57.280
<v Speaker 2>wonders.</v>
<v Speaker 2>there are many things that I don't </v>

687
00:34:57.280 --> 00:34:57.750
<v Speaker 2>understand.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think many things that we as a cult,</v>

688
00:34:57.780 --> 00:35:02.780
<v Speaker 2>he look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we don't even understand more than four </v>

689
00:35:02.780 --> 00:35:02.780
<v Speaker 2>percent of all the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

690
00:35:02.780 --> 00:35:02.780
<v Speaker 2>universe,</v>
<v Speaker 2>dark matter,</v>

691
00:35:02.780 --> 00:35:03.420
<v Speaker 2>dark energy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We have no idea what it is.</v>

692
00:35:03.421 --> 00:35:05.070
<v Speaker 2>MayBe it's lost socks.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What do I know?</v>

693
00:35:05.610 --> 00:35:10.050
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so all I can tell you is sort of my,</v>

694
00:35:10.210 --> 00:35:13.680
<v Speaker 2>my current religious or spiritual </v>
<v Speaker 2>sentiment is much closer to some form of</v>

695
00:35:13.681 --> 00:35:14.160
<v Speaker 2>buddhism.</v>

696
00:35:16.030 --> 00:35:17.830
<v Speaker 1>Can you just tell debbie income,</v>
<v Speaker 1>asian?</v>

697
00:35:18.340 --> 00:35:20.770
<v Speaker 1>Unfortunately,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's no evidence for reincarnation.</v>

698
00:35:21.100 --> 00:35:24.940
<v Speaker 1>So can you describe a way buddhism sees </v>
<v Speaker 1>the world a little bit?</v>

699
00:35:25.440 --> 00:35:26.160
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so the,</v>

700
00:35:26.161 --> 00:35:27.240
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they talk about.</v>

701
00:35:27.241 --> 00:35:32.241
<v Speaker 2>So when I spent several meetings with,</v>
<v Speaker 2>with the dalai lama and what always </v>

702
00:35:32.281 --> 00:35:33.990
<v Speaker 2>impressed me about him,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he really,</v>

703
00:35:33.991 --> 00:35:34.810
<v Speaker 2>unlike,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for example,</v>

704
00:35:34.811 --> 00:35:36.840
<v Speaker 2>a t there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the pope or some cottonelle,</v>

705
00:35:36.841 --> 00:35:38.010
<v Speaker 2>he emphasize</v>

706
00:35:38.010 --> 00:35:40.260
<v Speaker 3>minimizing the suffering of all </v>
<v Speaker 3>creatures.</v>

707
00:35:40.710 --> 00:35:43.170
<v Speaker 3>So they have this from the early </v>
<v Speaker 3>beginning.</v>

708
00:35:43.171 --> 00:35:46.140
<v Speaker 3>They look at suffering in all creatures,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not just in people,</v>

709
00:35:46.350 --> 00:35:49.350
<v Speaker 3>but in everybody.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This universal and of course by degrees,</v>

710
00:35:49.380 --> 00:35:52.050
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>An animal child Will have a less,</v>

711
00:35:52.090 --> 00:35:57.090
<v Speaker 3>is less capable of suffering than a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>than a well developed a normally </v>

712
00:35:57.090 --> 00:36:01.551
<v Speaker 3>developed human and um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they think consciousness pervades in </v>

713
00:36:01.551 --> 00:36:04.140
<v Speaker 3>this universe and they have these </v>
<v Speaker 3>techniques,</v>

714
00:36:04.160 --> 00:36:06.420
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can think of them like mindfulness,</v>

715
00:36:06.421 --> 00:36:11.421
<v Speaker 3>etc.</v>
<v Speaker 3>in meditation that ties to access sort </v>

716
00:36:11.421 --> 00:36:13.290
<v Speaker 3>of what they claim of this more </v>
<v Speaker 3>fundamental aspect of reality.</v>

717
00:36:13.291 --> 00:36:15.720
<v Speaker 3>I'm not sure it's more fundamentalist.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think about it.</v>

718
00:36:15.721 --> 00:36:18.870
<v Speaker 3>There's a physical and then there's this</v>
<v Speaker 3>insight you consciousness.</v>

719
00:36:18.871 --> 00:36:21.510
<v Speaker 3>and those are the two aspects.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's the only thing I've,</v>

720
00:36:21.780 --> 00:36:26.780
<v Speaker 3>I've access to in my life.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And you've got to remember my conscious </v>

721
00:36:26.780 --> 00:36:29.961
<v Speaker 3>expense and you're consciously explains,</v>
<v Speaker 3>comes prior to anything you know about </v>

722
00:36:29.961 --> 00:36:33.081
<v Speaker 3>physics comes pi to knowledge about the </v>
<v Speaker 3>universe and atoms and superstrings and </v>

723
00:36:33.081 --> 00:36:38.061
<v Speaker 3>molecules and all of that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The only thing you directly acquainted </v>

724
00:36:38.061 --> 00:36:41.481
<v Speaker 3>with this world that's populated with </v>
<v Speaker 3>things in images and sounds in your head</v>

725
00:36:41.701 --> 00:36:42.820
<v Speaker 3>and touch us and all of that.</v>

726
00:36:43.170 --> 00:36:48.170
<v Speaker 4>I actually have a question.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So it sounds like you kind of have a </v>

727
00:36:48.170 --> 00:36:52.351
<v Speaker 4>rich life.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You talk about rock climbing and it </v>

728
00:36:52.351 --> 00:36:55.591
<v Speaker 4>seems like you really love literature </v>
<v Speaker 4>and conscious ness is all about </v>

729
00:36:55.591 --> 00:37:00.120
<v Speaker 4>experiencing things.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So do you think that has helped your </v>

730
00:37:00.120 --> 00:37:00.290
<v Speaker 4>research on this topic?</v>

731
00:37:00.540 --> 00:37:01.120
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>

732
00:37:01.730 --> 00:37:06.730
<v Speaker 3>Particularly if you think about it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the value of statesville program when </v>

733
00:37:06.730 --> 00:37:10.151
<v Speaker 3>you do are climbing or now I do.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm going in a bike everyday you can get</v>

734
00:37:10.751 --> 00:37:13.620
<v Speaker 3>into this thing called the zone and I've</v>
<v Speaker 3>always wanted.</v>

735
00:37:13.710 --> 00:37:18.710
<v Speaker 3>I wanted above about a particular with </v>
<v Speaker 3>respect to continence because it's a </v>

736
00:37:18.710 --> 00:37:18.890
<v Speaker 3>strangely addictive state.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You want to,</v>

737
00:37:19.090 --> 00:37:20.750
<v Speaker 3>you want to appear.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

738
00:37:20.760 --> 00:37:25.760
<v Speaker 3>once people have had ones who want to </v>
<v Speaker 3>keep on going back to it and you wonder </v>

739
00:37:25.760 --> 00:37:25.990
<v Speaker 3>why,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what is it so addicting about it,</v>

740
00:37:25.991 --> 00:37:30.991
<v Speaker 3>and I think it's the experience of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>of almost close to pure experience </v>

741
00:37:30.991 --> 00:37:32.800
<v Speaker 3>because in this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in this zone,</v>

742
00:37:32.801 --> 00:37:34.850
<v Speaker 3>you're not conscious of inner voice </v>
<v Speaker 3>anymore.</v>

743
00:37:34.910 --> 00:37:37.420
<v Speaker 3>There's always the inner voice nagging </v>
<v Speaker 3>you or do you have to do this?</v>

744
00:37:37.421 --> 00:37:39.130
<v Speaker 3>You have to do that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You have to pay your taxes.</v>

745
00:37:39.131 --> 00:37:41.820
<v Speaker 3>He had this fight with your ex and all </v>
<v Speaker 3>of those things are always there,</v>

746
00:37:42.370 --> 00:37:47.370
<v Speaker 3>but when you're in the zone,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all of that is gone and your justice in </v>

747
00:37:47.370 --> 00:37:47.740
<v Speaker 3>this wonderful state,</v>
<v Speaker 3>while you're fully out in the world,</v>

748
00:37:47.870 --> 00:37:48.660
<v Speaker 3>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're,</v>

749
00:37:48.740 --> 00:37:51.970
<v Speaker 3>you're climbing or biking or doing </v>
<v Speaker 3>soccer,</v>

750
00:37:51.971 --> 00:37:54.970
<v Speaker 3>what or whatever you're doing and sort </v>
<v Speaker 3>of consciousness sort of.</v>

751
00:37:54.970 --> 00:37:58.210
<v Speaker 3>It says you're all action,</v>
<v Speaker 3>or in this case,</v>

752
00:37:58.211 --> 00:38:00.610
<v Speaker 3>a pure experience.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're not actually at all,</v>

753
00:38:00.880 --> 00:38:04.660
<v Speaker 3>but in both cases you experienced some </v>
<v Speaker 3>aspect of of con.</v>

754
00:38:04.690 --> 00:38:09.690
<v Speaker 3>You touched some basic part of of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>of conscious existence and it's so basic</v>

755
00:38:10.181 --> 00:38:14.720
<v Speaker 3>and so deeply satisfying you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think you tapped the award of being.</v>

756
00:38:14.870 --> 00:38:16.280
<v Speaker 3>That's really what you're touching </v>
<v Speaker 3>there.</v>

757
00:38:16.281 --> 00:38:21.281
<v Speaker 3>You're getting close to the root of </v>
<v Speaker 3>being and that's very different from </v>

758
00:38:21.281 --> 00:38:23.090
<v Speaker 3>intelligence.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So what do you think about</v>

759
00:38:23.210 --> 00:38:25.340
<v Speaker 4>the simulation hypothesis,</v>
<v Speaker 4>simulation theory,</v>

760
00:38:25.341 --> 00:38:27.650
<v Speaker 4>the idea that we all live in a computer </v>
<v Speaker 4>simulation.</v>

761
00:38:27.950 --> 00:38:28.390
<v Speaker 4>Have you done that?</v>

762
00:38:28.470 --> 00:38:31.300
<v Speaker 3>Just put notes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>laptops for nerds,</v>

763
00:38:31.750 --> 00:38:35.680
<v Speaker 3>for nerds.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think it's as likely as the hypothesis</v>

764
00:38:35.681 --> 00:38:36.430
<v Speaker 3>that engaged</v>

765
00:38:36.460 --> 00:38:41.460
<v Speaker 2>hundreds of scholars for many centuries.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Are we all just existing in the mind of </v>

766
00:38:41.460 --> 00:38:42.260
<v Speaker 2>god?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

767
00:38:42.520 --> 00:38:44.310
<v Speaker 2>And this is just a modern version of it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>

768
00:38:44.311 --> 00:38:45.100
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

769
00:38:45.160 --> 00:38:49.060
<v Speaker 2>it's equally plausible.</v>
<v Speaker 2>People love talking about these types of</v>

770
00:38:49.061 --> 00:38:50.470
<v Speaker 2>things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know that book written.</v>

771
00:38:50.471 --> 00:38:53.470
<v Speaker 2>So what the simulation hypothesis.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If that's what people want to do,</v>

772
00:38:53.471 --> 00:38:56.080
<v Speaker 2>that's fine.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Seems ratHer esoteric.</v>

773
00:38:56.110 --> 00:38:57.340
<v Speaker 2>It's never testable,</v>

774
00:38:58.170 --> 00:39:00.330
<v Speaker 1>but it's not useful for you to think of </v>
<v Speaker 1>it in those terms.</v>

775
00:39:00.331 --> 00:39:03.240
<v Speaker 1>So maybe connecting to the questions of </v>
<v Speaker 1>freewill,</v>

776
00:39:03.270 --> 00:39:04.840
<v Speaker 1>which you've talked about.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

777
00:39:05.010 --> 00:39:07.500
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think vaguely remember you saying that</v>

778
00:39:07.501 --> 00:39:10.150
<v Speaker 1>the idea that there is no freewill,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

779
00:39:10.470 --> 00:39:13.070
<v Speaker 1>it makes you very uncomfortable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

780
00:39:13.290 --> 00:39:16.200
<v Speaker 1>so what do you think about freewill in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>from,</v>

781
00:39:16.900 --> 00:39:19.210
<v Speaker 1>from a physics perspective,</v>
<v Speaker 1>from a conscious perspective,</v>

782
00:39:19.270 --> 00:39:20.770
<v Speaker 1>what does it all fit?</v>

783
00:39:20.800 --> 00:39:22.450
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So from the physics perspective,</v>

784
00:39:22.451 --> 00:39:27.451
<v Speaker 2>leaving aside quantum mechanics,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we believe we live in a fully </v>

785
00:39:27.451 --> 00:39:27.451
<v Speaker 2>deterministic world,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

786
00:39:27.451 --> 00:39:28.720
<v Speaker 2>But then comes up course quantum </v>
<v Speaker 2>mechanics.</v>

787
00:39:28.721 --> 00:39:30.930
<v Speaker 2>So now we know that certain things on </v>
<v Speaker 2>principle,</v>

788
00:39:30.940 --> 00:39:33.370
<v Speaker 2>not predictable,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which I put as you said,</v>

789
00:39:33.371 --> 00:39:38.371
<v Speaker 2>I prefer because the idea that at the </v>
<v Speaker 2>initial condition of the universe and </v>

790
00:39:38.371 --> 00:39:43.051
<v Speaker 2>then everything else would just acting </v>
<v Speaker 2>out the initial condition of the </v>

791
00:39:43.051 --> 00:39:43.051
<v Speaker 2>universe.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That doesn't.</v>

792
00:39:43.051 --> 00:39:45.160
<v Speaker 2>That doesn't mean it's not a romantic </v>
<v Speaker 2>notion.</v>

793
00:39:45.560 --> 00:39:48.430
<v Speaker 2>Suddenly not right now when it comes to </v>
<v Speaker 2>consciousness,</v>

794
00:39:48.431 --> 00:39:53.431
<v Speaker 2>I think we do have certain freedom.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We are much more constrained by physics </v>

795
00:39:53.431 --> 00:39:57.901
<v Speaker 2>of course,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and by our paths and by our own </v>

796
00:39:57.901 --> 00:39:59.791
<v Speaker 2>conscious desires and what our pounds </v>
<v Speaker 2>told us and what our environment tells </v>

797
00:39:59.791 --> 00:39:59.791
<v Speaker 2>us.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We,</v>

798
00:39:59.791 --> 00:40:04.100
<v Speaker 2>we all know that there's hundreds of </v>
<v Speaker 2>experiments that show how we can be </v>

799
00:40:04.100 --> 00:40:05.860
<v Speaker 2>influenced.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But finally in the final analysis,</v>

800
00:40:05.861 --> 00:40:10.861
<v Speaker 2>When you make a life that I'm talking </v>
<v Speaker 2>about really about critical decision </v>

801
00:40:10.861 --> 00:40:10.861
<v Speaker 2>where you really think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>should I marry?</v>

802
00:40:10.861 --> 00:40:12.130
<v Speaker 2>Should I go to this school,</v>
<v Speaker 2>have that,</v>

803
00:40:12.150 --> 00:40:14.710
<v Speaker 2>could take this job,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that job.</v>

804
00:40:14.860 --> 00:40:18.550
<v Speaker 2>Should I cheat on my taxes are not the </v>
<v Speaker 2>sort of,</v>

805
00:40:18.551 --> 00:40:23.551
<v Speaker 2>these are things where you really </v>
<v Speaker 2>deliberate and I think on those </v>

806
00:40:23.551 --> 00:40:24.580
<v Speaker 2>condition you are as free as you can be </v>
<v Speaker 2>when you,</v>

807
00:40:24.581 --> 00:40:29.581
<v Speaker 2>when you bring your entire being and </v>
<v Speaker 2>time conscious being to that question </v>

808
00:40:31.001 --> 00:40:33.800
<v Speaker 2>and title analysts analyze it on all the</v>
<v Speaker 2>the values,</v>

809
00:40:33.801 --> 00:40:34.840
<v Speaker 2>condition.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then you take,</v>

810
00:40:35.260 --> 00:40:38.170
<v Speaker 2>you make a decision.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You are as free as you can ever be.</v>

811
00:40:38.650 --> 00:40:40.540
<v Speaker 2>That is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think what free will is.</v>

812
00:40:40.541 --> 00:40:45.541
<v Speaker 2>It's not a will.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's totally free to do anything it </v>

813
00:40:45.541 --> 00:40:45.541
<v Speaker 2>wants.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's not possible.</v>

814
00:40:45.690 --> 00:40:48.330
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So as jack mentioned,</v>

815
00:40:48.790 --> 00:40:53.670
<v Speaker 1>you actually write a blog about books </v>
<v Speaker 1>you've read amazing books from.</v>

816
00:40:53.730 --> 00:40:56.860
<v Speaker 1>I'm rushing from my son.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Might have been tough.</v>

817
00:40:57.110 --> 00:40:59.040
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Neil gaiman,</v>

818
00:40:59.070 --> 00:41:04.070
<v Speaker 1>carl sagan murakami.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what is a book that early in your </v>

819
00:41:04.070 --> 00:41:06.420
<v Speaker 1>life transform the way you saw the </v>
<v Speaker 1>world?</v>

820
00:41:06.480 --> 00:41:07.650
<v Speaker 1>Something that changed your life,</v>

821
00:41:09.940 --> 00:41:14.940
<v Speaker 2>I guess did the spokes are twisted </v>
<v Speaker 2>because he talks about some of these </v>

822
00:41:14.940 --> 00:41:14.940
<v Speaker 2>problems,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

823
00:41:14.940 --> 00:41:17.980
<v Speaker 2>he was one of the first discovery of the</v>
<v Speaker 2>unconscious because,</v>

824
00:41:18.080 --> 00:41:21.180
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a little bit before freud when it wasn't</v>

825
00:41:21.181 --> 00:41:26.181
<v Speaker 2>in the air and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he makes all these claims that people </v>

826
00:41:26.181 --> 00:41:30.971
<v Speaker 2>sort of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know the guys on the mass of charity </v>

827
00:41:30.971 --> 00:41:34.090
<v Speaker 2>actually are very non charitable.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So he of really the first discovery of a</v>

828
00:41:36.470 --> 00:41:40.010
<v Speaker 2>great line of the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of the unconscious and that,</v>

829
00:41:40.011 --> 00:41:41.180
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that really taught me.</v>

830
00:41:41.380 --> 00:41:46.380
<v Speaker 1>And what do you think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what do you think about the unconscious </v>

831
00:41:46.380 --> 00:41:46.380
<v Speaker 1>w?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What do you think about freud with think</v>

832
00:41:46.380 --> 00:41:47.490
<v Speaker 1>about these ideas?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's,</v>

833
00:41:47.640 --> 00:41:49.630
<v Speaker 1>what's just like dark matter in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>universe?</v>

834
00:41:49.710 --> 00:41:51.700
<v Speaker 1>What's over there in that unconscious</v>

835
00:41:51.950 --> 00:41:53.750
<v Speaker 2>a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean much more than we think,</v>

836
00:41:53.760 --> 00:41:56.090
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is what a lot of last hundred years</v>

837
00:41:56.091 --> 00:41:58.820
<v Speaker 2>of research has shown.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I think he was a genius,</v>

838
00:41:59.260 --> 00:42:01.040
<v Speaker 2>misguided towards the end,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but he was all.</v>

839
00:42:01.041 --> 00:42:03.650
<v Speaker 2>He started out as a neuroscientist.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He contributed,</v>

840
00:42:03.651 --> 00:42:05.430
<v Speaker 2>he did studies on the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

841
00:42:06.140 --> 00:42:11.140
<v Speaker 2>on the lamprey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>contributed himself to the neuron </v>

842
00:42:11.140 --> 00:42:14.591
<v Speaker 2>hypothesis,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the idea that they're discrete units </v>

843
00:42:14.591 --> 00:42:14.591
<v Speaker 2>that we call ourselves now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then he started,</v>

844
00:42:14.591 --> 00:42:15.800
<v Speaker 2>then he,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he,</v>

845
00:42:15.801 --> 00:42:16.910
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>bought,</v>

846
00:42:16.911 --> 00:42:21.911
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>about the unconscious and I think it's </v>

847
00:42:21.911 --> 00:42:21.911
<v Speaker 2>too,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's lots of stuff happening.</v>

848
00:42:21.911 --> 00:42:22.420
<v Speaker 2>You feel this particular,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

849
00:42:22.520 --> 00:42:24.920
<v Speaker 2>when you're in a relationship and it </v>
<v Speaker 2>breaks our son now,</v>

850
00:42:24.921 --> 00:42:26.660
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then you have this terrible.</v>

851
00:42:26.661 --> 00:42:29.880
<v Speaker 2>You can have love and hate and lust and </v>
<v Speaker 2>anger and all.</v>

852
00:42:29.900 --> 00:42:33.290
<v Speaker 2>It's mixed in.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And when you title analyzed yourself,</v>

853
00:42:33.291 --> 00:42:35.720
<v Speaker 2>why am I so upset?</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's very,</v>

854
00:42:35.721 --> 00:42:38.800
<v Speaker 2>very difficult to penetrate to those </v>
<v Speaker 2>basements,</v>

855
00:42:38.810 --> 00:42:43.810
<v Speaker 2>those cabins in your mind because the </v>
<v Speaker 2>subconscious doesn't have access to </v>

856
00:42:44.451 --> 00:42:49.451
<v Speaker 2>those,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but there they are made in the amygdala </v>

857
00:42:49.451 --> 00:42:51.540
<v Speaker 2>or lots of other places.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They make you upset or angry or sad or </v>

858
00:42:51.540 --> 00:42:55.331
<v Speaker 2>depressed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it's very difficult to try to </v>

859
00:42:55.331 --> 00:42:55.490
<v Speaker 2>actually uncover the reason you can go </v>
<v Speaker 2>to a shrink.</v>

860
00:42:55.491 --> 00:43:00.491
<v Speaker 2>You can talk wIth your friend endlessly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You couldn't start finally a story why </v>

861
00:43:00.491 --> 00:43:04.361
<v Speaker 2>this happened,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why you love or don't love her or </v>

862
00:43:04.361 --> 00:43:04.361
<v Speaker 2>whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you don't really know whether that's</v>

863
00:43:04.361 --> 00:43:08.471
<v Speaker 2>actually the way that that actually </v>
<v Speaker 2>happened because you simply don't have </v>

864
00:43:08.471 --> 00:43:09.410
<v Speaker 2>access to those parts of the brain and </v>
<v Speaker 2>they're very powerful.</v>

865
00:43:09.640 --> 00:43:12.150
<v Speaker 1>You think that's a feature or a bug of </v>
<v Speaker 1>our brain?</v>

866
00:43:12.510 --> 00:43:16.590
<v Speaker 1>The fact that we have this deep </v>
<v Speaker 1>difficult to dive into subconscious.</v>

867
00:43:16.860 --> 00:43:19.050
<v Speaker 2>I think it's a feature because </v>
<v Speaker 2>otherwise,</v>

868
00:43:19.230 --> 00:43:24.230
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we are like any other brain or nervous </v>

869
00:43:24.381 --> 00:43:28.130
<v Speaker 2>system or computer.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We are severely band limited.</v>

870
00:43:28.520 --> 00:43:31.310
<v Speaker 2>If we,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if everything I do,</v>

871
00:43:31.311 --> 00:43:33.980
<v Speaker 2>every emotion I feel every eye movements</v>
<v Speaker 2>I make,</v>

872
00:43:33.981 --> 00:43:36.890
<v Speaker 2>if all of that had to be under the </v>
<v Speaker 2>control of consciousness,</v>

873
00:43:36.891 --> 00:43:39.560
<v Speaker 2>I couldn't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I couldn't.</v>

874
00:43:39.860 --> 00:43:41.570
<v Speaker 2>I wouldn't be here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

875
00:43:41.571 --> 00:43:44.510
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so what you do early on your brain,</v>

876
00:43:44.511 --> 00:43:49.511
<v Speaker 2>you have to be conscious when you learn </v>
<v Speaker 2>things like typing or like riding on a </v>

877
00:43:49.511 --> 00:43:49.670
<v Speaker 2>bike,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but then what you do,</v>

878
00:43:49.671 --> 00:43:54.240
<v Speaker 2>you attain up our basal ganglia and </v>
<v Speaker 2>stratum you.</v>

879
00:43:54.340 --> 00:43:59.340
<v Speaker 2>You train up different parts of your </v>
<v Speaker 2>brain and then once you do it </v>

880
00:43:59.340 --> 00:44:02.831
<v Speaker 2>automatically like typing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can show you do it much faster </v>

881
00:44:02.831 --> 00:44:03.430
<v Speaker 2>without even thinking about it because </v>
<v Speaker 2>you've got these highly specialized what</v>

882
00:44:03.550 --> 00:44:05.450
<v Speaker 2>francis crick and I called zombie agents</v>

883
00:44:06.310 --> 00:44:11.310
<v Speaker 1>that I can sort of taken care of that </v>
<v Speaker 1>while your consciousness can sort of </v>

884
00:44:11.310 --> 00:44:14.521
<v Speaker 1>worry about the abstract sense of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>text to one of wide and I think that's </v>

885
00:44:14.521 --> 00:44:14.521
<v Speaker 1>true for many,</v>
<v Speaker 1>many things,</v>

886
00:44:14.740 --> 00:44:19.740
<v Speaker 1>but for the things like uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all the fights you had with the ex </v>

887
00:44:19.740 --> 00:44:24.091
<v Speaker 1>girlfriend,</v>
<v Speaker 1>things that you would think are not </v>

888
00:44:24.091 --> 00:44:24.850
<v Speaker 1>useful to still linger somewhere in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>subconscious.</v>

889
00:44:25.180 --> 00:44:28.000
<v Speaker 1>So that seems like a bug that it would </v>
<v Speaker 1>staY there.</v>

890
00:44:28.320 --> 00:44:32.190
<v Speaker 2>You think it would be better if you can </v>
<v Speaker 2>analyze and then get it out the system</v>

891
00:44:32.190 --> 00:44:34.380
<v Speaker 1>or just forget it ever happened?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

892
00:44:34.381 --> 00:44:36.960
<v Speaker 1>that that seems a very buggy kind of.</v>

893
00:44:37.520 --> 00:44:39.320
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>In general we don't have.</v>

894
00:44:39.321 --> 00:44:44.321
<v Speaker 2>And that's probably functional.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We don't have an ability unless it's </v>

895
00:44:44.321 --> 00:44:47.351
<v Speaker 2>extremely off cases,</v>
<v Speaker 2>clinical dissociation side when people </v>

896
00:44:47.351 --> 00:44:51.140
<v Speaker 2>are heavily abused,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when they completely repressed the </v>

897
00:44:51.140 --> 00:44:51.140
<v Speaker 2>memory.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But that doeSn't happen in,</v>

898
00:44:51.140 --> 00:44:51.800
<v Speaker 2>in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in,</v>

899
00:44:51.830 --> 00:44:56.830
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in normal people we don't have an </v>

900
00:44:56.830 --> 00:44:58.400
<v Speaker 2>ability to move traumatic memories and </v>
<v Speaker 2>of course we suffer from that.</v>

901
00:44:58.940 --> 00:45:03.940
<v Speaker 2>On the other hand,</v>
<v Speaker 2>probably if you had the ability to </v>

902
00:45:03.940 --> 00:45:07.031
<v Speaker 2>constantly wipe your memory,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you'll probably do it to an extent that </v>

903
00:45:07.031 --> 00:45:07.490
<v Speaker 2>isn't useful to you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So</v>

904
00:45:08.510 --> 00:45:10.280
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a good question.</v>

905
00:45:10.281 --> 00:45:12.590
<v Speaker 1>it's a balance.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I'm on the books,</v>

906
00:45:12.591 --> 00:45:15.650
<v Speaker 1>as jack mentioned,</v>
<v Speaker 1>correct me if I'm wrong,</v>

907
00:45:15.651 --> 00:45:20.360
<v Speaker 1>but a broadly speaking in academia and </v>
<v Speaker 1>the different scientific disciplines,</v>

908
00:45:20.361 --> 00:45:25.361
<v Speaker 1>certainly in engineering,</v>
<v Speaker 1>reading literature seems to be a rare </v>

909
00:45:25.361 --> 00:45:27.260
<v Speaker 1>pursuit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Perhaps I'm wrong in this,</v>

910
00:45:27.261 --> 00:45:32.261
<v Speaker 1>but that's in my experience,</v>
<v Speaker 1>most people are much more technical </v>

911
00:45:32.261 --> 00:45:35.411
<v Speaker 1>texts and do not sort of escape or seek </v>
<v Speaker 1>truth in literature.</v>

912
00:45:35.960 --> 00:45:38.330
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it seems like you do a.</v>

913
00:45:38.331 --> 00:45:43.331
<v Speaker 1>So what do you think is the value?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What do you think literature as the </v>

914
00:45:43.331 --> 00:45:45.260
<v Speaker 1>pursuit of scientific truth,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do you think it's good?</v>

915
00:45:45.320 --> 00:45:46.990
<v Speaker 1>It's useful for a</v>

916
00:45:47.270 --> 00:45:49.260
<v Speaker 2>government access too much wide,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

917
00:45:49.261 --> 00:45:50.320
<v Speaker 2>of a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of a,</v>

918
00:45:50.321 --> 00:45:51.770
<v Speaker 2>of human experiences.</v>

919
00:45:52.470 --> 00:45:53.910
<v Speaker 1>How valuable do you think it is?</v>

920
00:45:54.150 --> 00:45:59.150
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you want to understand human nature </v>

921
00:45:59.150 --> 00:46:01.881
<v Speaker 2>and nature in general,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then I think you'll have to better </v>

922
00:46:01.881 --> 00:46:04.131
<v Speaker 2>understand wide variety of experiences,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not just sitting in a lab staring at a </v>

923
00:46:04.351 --> 00:46:06.720
<v Speaker 2>screen and having a piece flashed onto </v>
<v Speaker 2>your planner,</v>

924
00:46:06.780 --> 00:46:08.280
<v Speaker 2>melissa pushing a button.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's what.</v>

925
00:46:08.670 --> 00:46:10.560
<v Speaker 2>That's what I usually do that for most </v>
<v Speaker 2>psychologists do.</v>

926
00:46:10.561 --> 00:46:15.561
<v Speaker 2>there's nothing wrong with that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you need to consider lots of other </v>

927
00:46:15.561 --> 00:46:18.990
<v Speaker 2>strange states and literature is a </v>
<v Speaker 2>shortcut for this as well.</v>

928
00:46:19.021 --> 00:46:19.890
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because literature,</v>

929
00:46:19.910 --> 00:46:24.910
<v Speaker 2>that's what literature is all about.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All sorts of interesting experiences </v>

930
00:46:24.910 --> 00:46:26.820
<v Speaker 2>that people have know the contingency of</v>
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>

931
00:46:26.821 --> 00:46:29.100
<v Speaker 2>the fact that you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>women experience a world different.</v>

932
00:46:29.101 --> 00:46:34.101
<v Speaker 2>Black people experience the world </v>
<v Speaker 2>different and the one way to expense </v>

933
00:46:34.101 --> 00:46:35.640
<v Speaker 2>that is reading all these different </v>
<v Speaker 2>literature and title.</v>

934
00:46:35.910 --> 00:46:40.910
<v Speaker 2>Find out you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you see everything so relative and you </v>

935
00:46:40.910 --> 00:46:40.920
<v Speaker 2>read the book years ago they thought </v>
<v Speaker 2>about certain problems very,</v>

936
00:46:40.921 --> 00:46:42.930
<v Speaker 2>very differently than the.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then as today,</v>

937
00:46:43.170 --> 00:46:44.560
<v Speaker 2>we today,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like any culture,</v>

938
00:46:44.561 --> 00:46:47.250
<v Speaker 2>I think we know it all.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's common to every culture.</v>

939
00:46:47.251 --> 00:46:50.640
<v Speaker 2>Every culture believes that at a td.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They know it all and then you realize,</v>

940
00:46:50.641 --> 00:46:55.641
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's other ways of viewing the </v>

941
00:46:55.641 --> 00:46:55.641
<v Speaker 2>universe and some of them may have lots </v>
<v Speaker 2>of things in their favor.</v>

942
00:46:56.620 --> 00:47:01.390
<v Speaker 1>So this is a question I wanted to ask </v>
<v Speaker 1>about timescale or scale in general,</v>

943
00:47:02.530 --> 00:47:06.220
<v Speaker 1>when you with it or in general tried to </v>
<v Speaker 1>think about consciousness.</v>

944
00:47:06.310 --> 00:47:11.310
<v Speaker 1>Trying to think about these ideas were </v>
<v Speaker 1>kind of naturally thinking human </v>

945
00:47:11.310 --> 00:47:13.480
<v Speaker 1>timescales.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you um,</v>

946
00:47:13.540 --> 00:47:14.290
<v Speaker 1>or,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and also,</v>

947
00:47:15.150 --> 00:47:18.580
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>entities that are sized close to humans,</v>

948
00:47:19.000 --> 00:47:20.550
<v Speaker 1>do you think of things that are much </v>
<v Speaker 1>larger,</v>

949
00:47:20.570 --> 00:47:24.460
<v Speaker 1>much smaller as containing consciousness</v>
<v Speaker 1>and do you think are things that take,</v>

950
00:47:25.240 --> 00:47:27.580
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

951
00:47:27.610 --> 00:47:28.840
<v Speaker 1>the ages?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

952
00:47:29.530 --> 00:47:30.230
<v Speaker 1>to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

953
00:47:30.430 --> 00:47:34.450
<v Speaker 3>to operate in their conscious cause.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Effect cause effect.</v>

954
00:47:34.660 --> 00:47:35.740
<v Speaker 3>It's a reallY good question.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So yeah,</v>

955
00:47:35.741 --> 00:47:38.230
<v Speaker 3>I think a lot about small creatures </v>
<v Speaker 3>because experimentally,</v>

956
00:47:38.231 --> 00:47:40.720
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a lot of people work on flies and bees.</v>

957
00:47:41.110 --> 00:47:46.110
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so most people just think they are </v>

958
00:47:46.110 --> 00:47:46.110
<v Speaker 3>tolmatter.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're just bags for heaven sake.</v>

959
00:47:46.110 --> 00:47:46.480
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>But if you look at their behavior,</v>

960
00:47:46.481 --> 00:47:48.790
<v Speaker 3>like being,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he can recognize individual humans,</v>

961
00:47:48.791 --> 00:47:52.210
<v Speaker 3>they have this very complicated way to </v>
<v Speaker 3>communicate.</v>

962
00:47:52.390 --> 00:47:53.920
<v Speaker 3>If you've ever been involved with,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

963
00:47:53.921 --> 00:47:57.400
<v Speaker 3>your pounds when they bought a house,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what sort of agonizing decision that is,</v>

964
00:47:57.700 --> 00:48:02.700
<v Speaker 3>and bees have to do that once a year.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'd when they swarm in the spring and </v>

965
00:48:02.700 --> 00:48:04.320
<v Speaker 3>then they have this very elaborate way.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They have free not scouted the.</v>

966
00:48:04.340 --> 00:48:06.130
<v Speaker 3>They go to the individual sites,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they come back,</v>

967
00:48:06.131 --> 00:48:07.510
<v Speaker 3>they have this power,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this dance.</v>

968
00:48:07.511 --> 00:48:09.130
<v Speaker 3>Literally where the dance was several </v>
<v Speaker 3>days.</v>

969
00:48:09.340 --> 00:48:10.830
<v Speaker 3>They try to recruit other leaders.</v>

970
00:48:10.870 --> 00:48:12.340
<v Speaker 3>Very complicated decision.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Wait,</v>

971
00:48:12.580 --> 00:48:14.320
<v Speaker 3>when they finally wanting to make a </v>
<v Speaker 3>decision,</v>

972
00:48:14.321 --> 00:48:17.430
<v Speaker 3>the entire swarm,</v>
<v Speaker 3>their scouts warm up the entire swim and</v>

973
00:48:17.431 --> 00:48:19.450
<v Speaker 3>then go to one occasion.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They don't go to christian.</v>

974
00:48:19.510 --> 00:48:22.570
<v Speaker 3>They go to one location that they scout </v>
<v Speaker 3>type agreed upon by themselves.</v>

975
00:48:22.580 --> 00:48:24.940
<v Speaker 3>That's awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But look at the circuit complexity.</v>

976
00:48:24.941 --> 00:48:28.270
<v Speaker 3>It's 10 times more dense than anything </v>
<v Speaker 3>we have in our brain or they only have a</v>

977
00:48:28.271 --> 00:48:30.460
<v Speaker 3>million neurons,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but then you amazingly complex,</v>

978
00:48:30.730 --> 00:48:32.720
<v Speaker 3>complex behavior,</v>
<v Speaker 3>very complicated circuitry.</v>

979
00:48:32.730 --> 00:48:34.240
<v Speaker 3>So there's no question that they </v>
<v Speaker 3>experienced.</v>

980
00:48:34.241 --> 00:48:37.030
<v Speaker 3>Something they alive is very different.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're tiny.</v>

981
00:48:37.270 --> 00:48:42.270
<v Speaker 3>The only live you know for,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for workers live from maybe for two </v>

982
00:48:42.270 --> 00:48:44.290
<v Speaker 3>months.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I think it tells you this,</v>

983
00:48:44.291 --> 00:48:49.291
<v Speaker 3>in principle,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the substrate of consciousness is the </v>

984
00:48:49.291 --> 00:48:52.531
<v Speaker 3>substrate that maximizes the cause </v>
<v Speaker 3>effect power over all possible spatial </v>

985
00:48:52.531 --> 00:48:53.920
<v Speaker 3>temporal grains.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So when I think about,</v>

986
00:48:53.921 --> 00:48:55.690
<v Speaker 3>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 3>do you know the science fiction story,</v>

987
00:48:55.700 --> 00:48:58.400
<v Speaker 3>the black cloud,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's a classic,</v>

988
00:48:58.440 --> 00:48:59.650
<v Speaker 3>I forgot holiday astronomer.</v>

989
00:49:00.040 --> 00:49:05.040
<v Speaker 3>He has this cloud intervening between </v>
<v Speaker 3>the earth and the sun and I'm leading to</v>

990
00:49:05.891 --> 00:49:08.710
<v Speaker 3>some sort of to global cooling.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is written in the fifties.</v>

991
00:49:08.980 --> 00:49:11.680
<v Speaker 3>It turns out you can using the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the um,</v>

992
00:49:11.730 --> 00:49:16.730
<v Speaker 3>the radio dish they communicate was </v>
<v Speaker 3>actually an entity to actually </v>

993
00:49:16.730 --> 00:49:17.140
<v Speaker 3>intelligent entity and they,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they,</v>

994
00:49:17.170 --> 00:49:19.570
<v Speaker 3>they sort of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they convinced her to move away.</v>

995
00:49:20.140 --> 00:49:22.300
<v Speaker 3>But here you have a radical different </v>
<v Speaker 3>entity.</v>

996
00:49:22.301 --> 00:49:24.640
<v Speaker 3>And in pencil it says,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

997
00:49:24.641 --> 00:49:29.641
<v Speaker 3>you can measure the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the integrated information in principle </v>

998
00:49:29.641 --> 00:49:29.641
<v Speaker 3>at least.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And yes,</v>

999
00:49:29.641 --> 00:49:33.721
<v Speaker 3>if that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if the maximum of that occurs at a </v>

1000
00:49:33.721 --> 00:49:35.440
<v Speaker 3>timescale of month rather than an asset </v>
<v Speaker 3>for the fraction of a second.</v>

1001
00:49:35.590 --> 00:49:40.590
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And they would experience life where </v>

1002
00:49:40.590 --> 00:49:40.590
<v Speaker 3>each moment is a month rather than,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

1003
00:49:40.690 --> 00:49:41.850
<v Speaker 3>or microseconds,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1004
00:49:41.860 --> 00:49:45.880
<v Speaker 3>Rather than a fraction of a second in </v>
<v Speaker 3>the human case.</v>

1005
00:49:46.690 --> 00:49:51.690
<v Speaker 3>And so there may be forms of conscience </v>
<v Speaker 3>that we simply don't recognize for what </v>

1006
00:49:51.690 --> 00:49:55.501
<v Speaker 3>they are because they are so radical,</v>
<v Speaker 3>different from anything you and I are </v>

1007
00:49:55.501 --> 00:49:55.501
<v Speaker 3>used to.</v>

1008
00:49:55.780 --> 00:49:57.100
<v Speaker 3>Again,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's why it's good to read.</v>

1009
00:49:58.000 --> 00:50:01.970
<v Speaker 3>Or to what science fiction where we want</v>
<v Speaker 3>to think about this like this.</v>

1010
00:50:02.290 --> 00:50:06.240
<v Speaker 3>Do you know stanislaw lem,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this polished and sectional he bought it</v>

1011
00:50:06.280 --> 00:50:08.960
<v Speaker 3>was turned into a hollywood movie.</v>
<v Speaker 3>His best novel.</v>

1012
00:50:08.961 --> 00:50:10.550
<v Speaker 3>So it was in the sixties,</v>
<v Speaker 3>very,</v>

1013
00:50:10.720 --> 00:50:15.720
<v Speaker 3>very engineered,</v>
<v Speaker 3>engineered back on his most interesting </v>

1014
00:50:15.720 --> 00:50:16.750
<v Speaker 3>novel is called the victoria's where I'm</v>
<v Speaker 3>human,</v>

1015
00:50:16.751 --> 00:50:18.190
<v Speaker 3>civilization they,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they,</v>

1016
00:50:18.250 --> 00:50:18.850
<v Speaker 3>they,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they,</v>

1017
00:50:18.851 --> 00:50:23.851
<v Speaker 3>they have this mission to this planet </v>
<v Speaker 3>and everything is just tired and they </v>

1018
00:50:23.851 --> 00:50:27.571
<v Speaker 3>discover machines.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Schumann's got killed and then these </v>

1019
00:50:27.571 --> 00:50:30.601
<v Speaker 3>machines took over.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There was a machine evolution at </v>

1020
00:50:30.601 --> 00:50:34.180
<v Speaker 3>dominion evolution.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He talks about this very vividly and </v>

1021
00:50:34.180 --> 00:50:37.241
<v Speaker 3>finally the dominant.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're the dominant machine </v>

1022
00:50:37.241 --> 00:50:40.601
<v Speaker 3>intelligence organisms that survive are </v>
<v Speaker 3>gigantic clouds of little hexagonal </v>

1023
00:50:40.821 --> 00:50:43.570
<v Speaker 3>universal cell automata.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This was in the sixties,</v>

1024
00:50:44.140 --> 00:50:47.270
<v Speaker 3>but typically they're all lying on the </v>
<v Speaker 3>ground individual by themselves.</v>

1025
00:50:47.271 --> 00:50:52.271
<v Speaker 3>But in times of kaiser's econ,</v>
<v Speaker 3>communicate the assembling to gigantic </v>

1026
00:50:52.271 --> 00:50:55.961
<v Speaker 3>nets into clouds.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Billions of these particles and then </v>

1027
00:50:55.961 --> 00:50:59.471
<v Speaker 3>theY become hyper intelligent and they </v>
<v Speaker 3>can beat anything that humans can of </v>

1028
00:50:59.471 --> 00:50:59.530
<v Speaker 3>control it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It,</v>

1029
00:50:59.900 --> 00:51:04.900
<v Speaker 3>it's a very beautiful and compelling </v>
<v Speaker 3>where you have an intelligence where </v>

1030
00:51:04.900 --> 00:51:09.101
<v Speaker 3>finally the schumann's leave the planet.</v>
<v Speaker 3>TheY simply unable to understand and </v>

1031
00:51:09.101 --> 00:51:09.740
<v Speaker 3>comprehend this creature and they can </v>
<v Speaker 3>say,</v>

1032
00:51:09.741 --> 00:51:11.530
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>either we can nuke the entire planet and</v>

1033
00:51:11.540 --> 00:51:15.050
<v Speaker 3>just tired or we just have to leave </v>
<v Speaker 3>because fundamentally it's an,</v>

1034
00:51:15.070 --> 00:51:20.070
<v Speaker 3>it's an alien.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's so alien from us in our ideas that </v>

1035
00:51:20.070 --> 00:51:20.070
<v Speaker 3>we cannot communicate with them.</v>

1036
00:51:21.130 --> 00:51:22.840
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Actually in conversation.</v>

1037
00:51:22.841 --> 00:51:27.841
<v Speaker 1>So your talent to us steel steel from </v>
<v Speaker 1>brought up is that there could be to his</v>

1038
00:51:27.921 --> 00:51:29.320
<v Speaker 1>ideas that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1039
00:51:29.370 --> 00:51:33.580
<v Speaker 1>you already have these artificial </v>
<v Speaker 1>general intelligence like super smart or</v>

1040
00:51:33.581 --> 00:51:38.581
<v Speaker 1>maybe conscious beings in these sally or</v>
<v Speaker 1>tom and we just don't know how to talk </v>

1041
00:51:38.581 --> 00:51:41.731
<v Speaker 1>to them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's the language of communication </v>

1042
00:51:41.731 --> 00:51:41.731
<v Speaker 1>because you don't know what to do with </v>
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

1043
00:51:41.731 --> 00:51:46.290
<v Speaker 1>So that's one sort of view is a </v>
<v Speaker 1>consciousness is only something you can </v>

1044
00:51:46.290 --> 00:51:51.210
<v Speaker 1>measure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's not conscious if you can't </v>

1045
00:51:51.210 --> 00:51:51.210
<v Speaker 1>measure it.</v>

1046
00:51:51.210 --> 00:51:53.000
<v Speaker 3>So you're making an ontological and an </v>
<v Speaker 3>epistemic statement.</v>

1047
00:51:53.001 --> 00:51:54.530
<v Speaker 3>One is they are,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they are.</v>

1048
00:51:54.930 --> 00:51:58.150
<v Speaker 3>it's just like seeing their multiverses.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That might be cool,</v>

1049
00:51:58.220 --> 00:52:00.150
<v Speaker 3>but I can't communicate with them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't have.</v>

1050
00:52:00.190 --> 00:52:03.140
<v Speaker 3>I can't have any noncitizen.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's an epistemic argument to.</v>

1051
00:52:03.440 --> 00:52:05.570
<v Speaker 3>Those are two different things,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so it may well be possible.</v>

1052
00:52:05.780 --> 00:52:07.610
<v Speaker 3>Look at another case that's happening </v>
<v Speaker 3>right now.</v>

1053
00:52:07.611 --> 00:52:09.470
<v Speaker 3>People are building these mini </v>
<v Speaker 3>organoids.</v>

1054
00:52:09.640 --> 00:52:12.920
<v Speaker 3>Do you know what is so you know you can </v>
<v Speaker 3>take stem cells from under your arm,</v>

1055
00:52:12.921 --> 00:52:15.260
<v Speaker 3>put it in a dish ad for transcription </v>
<v Speaker 3>factors,</v>

1056
00:52:15.261 --> 00:52:18.980
<v Speaker 3>and then you can induce him to to go </v>
<v Speaker 3>into large with large.</v>

1057
00:52:18.981 --> 00:52:23.981
<v Speaker 3>They have few millimeter.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They are like a half a million neurons </v>

1058
00:52:23.981 --> 00:52:26.470
<v Speaker 3>that looked like nerve cells in a dish </v>
<v Speaker 3>called mini organoids at harvard and </v>

1059
00:52:26.470 --> 00:52:26.930
<v Speaker 3>stanford.</v>
<v Speaker 3>EverYwhere they're building them.</v>

1060
00:52:27.230 --> 00:52:30.320
<v Speaker 3>It may be well be possible that they're </v>
<v Speaker 3>beginning to feel like something,</v>

1061
00:52:30.660 --> 00:52:33.290
<v Speaker 3>but we can't really communicate with </v>
<v Speaker 3>them right now.</v>

1062
00:52:33.500 --> 00:52:35.690
<v Speaker 3>So people are beginning to think about </v>
<v Speaker 3>the ethics of this,</v>

1063
00:52:35.720 --> 00:52:36.770
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>So yes,</v>

1064
00:52:36.771 --> 00:52:39.230
<v Speaker 3>he may be perfectly high,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but they made.</v>

1065
00:52:39.650 --> 00:52:41.780
<v Speaker 3>It's one question.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Are they conscious or not?</v>

1066
00:52:41.790 --> 00:52:43.850
<v Speaker 3>As totally separate question,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how would I know?</v>

1067
00:52:43.910 --> 00:52:44.960
<v Speaker 3>Those are two different things,</v>

1068
00:52:45.070 --> 00:52:50.070
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you could give advice to a young </v>

1069
00:52:50.070 --> 00:52:53.671
<v Speaker 1>researcher sort of dreaming of </v>
<v Speaker 1>understanding or creating human level </v>

1070
00:52:53.681 --> 00:52:58.681
<v Speaker 1>intelligence or consciousness,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what would you say follow your dreams?</v>

1071
00:53:01.200 --> 00:53:04.410
<v Speaker 1>Read quite widely.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Know I mean I,</v>

1072
00:53:04.411 --> 00:53:05.820
<v Speaker 1>I suppose,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what discipline,</v>

1073
00:53:05.840 --> 00:53:10.840
<v Speaker 1>what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what is the pursuit that they should </v>

1074
00:53:10.840 --> 00:53:10.840
<v Speaker 1>take on?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is it neuroscience?</v>

1075
00:53:10.840 --> 00:53:12.750
<v Speaker 1>Is a competition of cognitive science?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is it philosophy?</v>

1076
00:53:13.020 --> 00:53:16.610
<v Speaker 1>Is it computer science or politics?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I</v>

1077
00:53:16.670 --> 00:53:21.670
<v Speaker 3>know in a sense that okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so the only known system that have high </v>

1078
00:53:21.891 --> 00:53:25.650
<v Speaker 3>level of intelligence is homo sapiens,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so if you wanted to build it,</v>

1079
00:53:25.651 --> 00:53:28.760
<v Speaker 3>it's probably good to continue to study </v>
<v Speaker 3>closely what humans do.</v>

1080
00:53:28.770 --> 00:53:30.480
<v Speaker 3>So cognitive neuroscience,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1081
00:53:30.481 --> 00:53:35.481
<v Speaker 3>somewhere between cognitive neuroscience</v>
<v Speaker 3>on the one hand than some philosophy of </v>

1082
00:53:35.481 --> 00:53:36.180
<v Speaker 3>mind and then ai,</v>
<v Speaker 3>ai,</v>

1083
00:53:36.480 --> 00:53:39.750
<v Speaker 3>computer science.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can look at all the original ideas,</v>

1084
00:53:39.751 --> 00:53:41.600
<v Speaker 3>new network.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They all came from neon signs,</v>

1085
00:53:41.610 --> 00:53:43.820
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Or reinforcement,</v>

1086
00:53:43.830 --> 00:53:48.830
<v Speaker 3>whether it's snarky,</v>
<v Speaker 3>minsky billing is snarky or whether </v>

1087
00:53:48.830 --> 00:53:48.830
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1088
00:53:48.830 --> 00:53:49.170
<v Speaker 3>the early in visal experiments that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>How about that?</v>

1089
00:53:49.171 --> 00:53:51.870
<v Speaker 3>Then gave rise to networks and then </v>
<v Speaker 3>multilayer networks,</v>

1090
00:53:52.710 --> 00:53:55.020
<v Speaker 3>so it may well be possible.</v>
<v Speaker 3>In fact,</v>

1091
00:53:55.021 --> 00:53:57.990
<v Speaker 3>some people are you there to make the </v>
<v Speaker 3>next big step in ai.</v>

1092
00:53:57.991 --> 00:54:01.020
<v Speaker 3>Once we realize the limits of deep </v>
<v Speaker 3>convolutional networks,</v>

1093
00:54:01.470 --> 00:54:03.930
<v Speaker 3>I didn't do certain things,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but they can't really understand.</v>

1094
00:54:04.380 --> 00:54:05.200
<v Speaker 3>I did,</v>
<v Speaker 3>don't they?</v>

1095
00:54:05.240 --> 00:54:06.570
<v Speaker 3>They don't really.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They can't really.</v>

1096
00:54:06.571 --> 00:54:11.571
<v Speaker 3>I can't really show in one image,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I can show you a single image of </v>

1097
00:54:11.571 --> 00:54:14.780
<v Speaker 3>somebody pick pocket who steals a wallet</v>
<v Speaker 3>from a purse.</v>

1098
00:54:14.820 --> 00:54:16.390
<v Speaker 3>You immediately know that's a </v>
<v Speaker 3>pickpocket.</v>

1099
00:54:16.410 --> 00:54:18.240
<v Speaker 3>right now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Computer system will just say,</v>

1100
00:54:18.241 --> 00:54:19.110
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's a man.</v>

1101
00:54:19.111 --> 00:54:20.290
<v Speaker 3>It's a woman.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a purse.</v>

1102
00:54:20.880 --> 00:54:23.640
<v Speaker 3>Unless you turn this machine on,</v>
<v Speaker 3>showing it 100,000</v>

1103
00:54:23.641 --> 00:54:25.320
<v Speaker 3>pickpockets.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I taught it doesn't.</v>

1104
00:54:25.321 --> 00:54:27.840
<v Speaker 3>It doesn't have this easy understanding </v>
<v Speaker 3>that you have.</v>

1105
00:54:28.260 --> 00:54:33.260
<v Speaker 3>All right,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so so some people make the ironman in </v>

1106
00:54:33.260 --> 00:54:36.231
<v Speaker 3>order to go to the next step or you </v>
<v Speaker 3>really want to build machines that </v>

1107
00:54:36.231 --> 00:54:36.231
<v Speaker 3>understand in a way,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you and I,</v>

1108
00:54:36.231 --> 00:54:40.221
<v Speaker 3>we have to go to psychology.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We need to understand how we do it in </v>

1109
00:54:40.221 --> 00:54:40.290
<v Speaker 3>our brains,</v>
<v Speaker 3>enable us to do it,</v>

1110
00:54:40.320 --> 00:54:45.320
<v Speaker 3>and so therefore being on the cast,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's also so exciting to try to </v>

1111
00:54:45.320 --> 00:54:49.131
<v Speaker 3>understand better our nature and then to</v>
<v Speaker 3>build to take some of those insight and </v>

1112
00:54:49.131 --> 00:54:53.301
<v Speaker 3>build them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I think the most exciting thing is </v>

1113
00:54:53.301 --> 00:54:53.301
<v Speaker 3>somewhere in the interface between </v>
<v Speaker 3>cognitive science,</v>

1114
00:54:53.301 --> 00:54:53.790
<v Speaker 3>neuroscience,</v>
<v Speaker 3>ai,</v>

1115
00:54:53.791 --> 00:54:55.590
<v Speaker 3>computer science and philosophy of mind.</v>

1116
00:54:56.620 --> 00:54:57.200
<v Speaker 1>beautiful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

1117
00:54:57.201 --> 00:55:00.250
<v Speaker 1>I'd say if there is from the machine </v>
<v Speaker 1>learning for from the computer science,</v>

1118
00:55:00.251 --> 00:55:05.251
<v Speaker 1>computer vision perspective may have the</v>
<v Speaker 1>research is kind of ignore the way the </v>

1119
00:55:05.251 --> 00:55:08.080
<v Speaker 1>human brain works.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can or even psychology or literature</v>

1120
00:55:08.081 --> 00:55:12.610
<v Speaker 1>or studying the brain.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would hope josh tannenbaum talks about</v>

1121
00:55:12.670 --> 00:55:16.070
<v Speaker 1>bringing that in more and more and </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a.</v>

1122
00:55:17.240 --> 00:55:19.600
<v Speaker 1>So you've worked on some amazing stuff </v>
<v Speaker 1>throughout your life.</v>

1123
00:55:19.870 --> 00:55:24.280
<v Speaker 1>What's the thing that you're really </v>
<v Speaker 1>excited about?</v>

1124
00:55:24.340 --> 00:55:29.340
<v Speaker 1>What's the mystery that you would love </v>
<v Speaker 1>to uncover in the near term beyond </v>

1125
00:55:29.950 --> 00:55:32.290
<v Speaker 1>beyond all the mr dharia already </v>
<v Speaker 1>surrounded by.</v>

1126
00:55:32.840 --> 00:55:37.840
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so that's this tuck shop called the </v>

1127
00:55:37.840 --> 00:55:39.410
<v Speaker 3>cloth [inaudible].</v>
<v Speaker 3>Underneath our cortex is a big.</v>

1128
00:55:39.780 --> 00:55:42.230
<v Speaker 3>You have one on the left,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right underneath this,</v>

1129
00:55:42.500 --> 00:55:44.120
<v Speaker 3>underneath the insula.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's very thin,</v>

1130
00:55:44.121 --> 00:55:45.980
<v Speaker 3>it's like one millimeter,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's embedded in,</v>

1131
00:55:45.981 --> 00:55:50.720
<v Speaker 3>in wiring in white matter is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's very difficult to image and um,</v>

1132
00:55:50.900 --> 00:55:51.950
<v Speaker 3>it has,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1133
00:55:51.951 --> 00:55:56.330
<v Speaker 3>it has connection to every cortical </v>
<v Speaker 3>region and francis kicked the last paper</v>

1134
00:55:56.331 --> 00:56:01.331
<v Speaker 3>you have,</v>
<v Speaker 3>have he dictated corrections the day he </v>

1135
00:56:01.331 --> 00:56:01.331
<v Speaker 3>died in hospital on this paper.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He and we,</v>

1136
00:56:01.420 --> 00:56:05.120
<v Speaker 3>it hypothesized,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well because it has this unique anatomy,</v>

1137
00:56:05.121 --> 00:56:10.121
<v Speaker 3>it gets input from every cortical area </v>
<v Speaker 3>and projects back to every area that the</v>

1138
00:56:11.001 --> 00:56:16.001
<v Speaker 3>function of this structure is similar.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That it's just a metaphor to the role of</v>

1139
00:56:16.320 --> 00:56:21.320
<v Speaker 3>conducting a sYmphony orchestra.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You have all the different cortical </v>

1140
00:56:21.320 --> 00:56:21.810
<v Speaker 3>players,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you have some that do motion,</v>

1141
00:56:21.811 --> 00:56:23.650
<v Speaker 3>some they do with theory of mind that </v>
<v Speaker 3>in,</v>

1142
00:56:23.651 --> 00:56:28.651
<v Speaker 3>for social interaction and calais and </v>
<v Speaker 3>hearing and all the different modules </v>

1143
00:56:28.651 --> 00:56:29.500
<v Speaker 3>and cortex,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but of course what consciousness is.</v>

1144
00:56:29.500 --> 00:56:31.860
<v Speaker 3>Consciousness puts it all together into </v>
<v Speaker 3>one package,</v>

1145
00:56:31.870 --> 00:56:32.750
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>The binding problem,</v>

1146
00:56:32.770 --> 00:56:37.770
<v Speaker 3>all of that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And this is really the function because </v>

1147
00:56:37.770 --> 00:56:38.140
<v Speaker 3>it has relatively few nuanced compared </v>
<v Speaker 3>to cop cappex,</v>

1148
00:56:38.141 --> 00:56:38.720
<v Speaker 3>but it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it,</v>

1149
00:56:38.800 --> 00:56:41.990
<v Speaker 3>it talks it a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it seeks input from all of them and they</v>

1150
00:56:42.010 --> 00:56:45.010
<v Speaker 3>project back to all of them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so we're testing that right now,</v>

1151
00:56:45.011 --> 00:56:48.450
<v Speaker 3>we've got this beautiful new owner </v>
<v Speaker 3>reconstruction in the mouse called count</v>

1152
00:56:48.451 --> 00:56:53.451
<v Speaker 3>of thought and kind of found new onset </v>
<v Speaker 3>or in the classroom that have the most </v>

1153
