00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:02.530
<v Speaker 1>The following is a conversation with </v>
<v Speaker 1>Vladimir of apnic.</v>

2
00:00:03.100 --> 00:00:05.230
<v Speaker 1>He's the inventor of the support vector </v>
<v Speaker 1>machines,</v>

3
00:00:05.290 --> 00:00:10.290
<v Speaker 1>support vector clustering,</v>
<v Speaker 1>vc theory and many foundational ideas </v>

4
00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:14.341
<v Speaker 1>and statistical learning is born in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Soviet Union and worked at the Institute</v>

5
00:00:15.280 --> 00:00:17.920
<v Speaker 1>of Control Sciences and Moscow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then in the United States.</v>

6
00:00:18.070 --> 00:00:23.070
<v Speaker 1>He worked at a and t and e Silabs </v>
<v Speaker 1>facebook research and now as a professor</v>

7
00:00:23.831 --> 00:00:28.831
<v Speaker 1>at Columbia University.</v>
<v Speaker 1>His work has been cited over 170,000</v>

8
00:00:28.991 --> 00:00:32.140
<v Speaker 1>times.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He has some very interesting ideas about</v>

9
00:00:32.141 --> 00:00:34.600
<v Speaker 1>artificial intelligence and the nature </v>
<v Speaker 1>of learning,</v>

10
00:00:34.810 --> 00:00:39.810
<v Speaker 1>especially on limits of our current </v>
<v Speaker 1>approaches and the open problems in the </v>

11
00:00:39.810 --> 00:00:43.801
<v Speaker 1>field.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This conversation is part of mit course </v>

12
00:00:43.801 --> 00:00:46.420
<v Speaker 1>on artificial general intelligence and </v>
<v Speaker 1>artificial intelligence podcasts.</v>

<v Speaker 1>other social networks at legs.</v>

16
00:00:57.160 --> 00:00:58.570
<v Speaker 1>Friedman,</v>
<v Speaker 1>spelled F,</v>

17
00:00:58.571 --> 00:00:59.590
<v Speaker 1>R I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>D,</v>

18
00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:03.360
<v Speaker 1>and now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Here's my conversation with Latimer vap.</v>

19
00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:08.380
<v Speaker 1>Nick Einstein famously said that God </v>
<v Speaker 1>doesn't play dice.</v>

20
00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:13.810
<v Speaker 1>You're.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have studied the world through the </v>

21
00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:14.090
<v Speaker 1>eyes of statistics,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so let me ask you,</v>

22
00:01:14.091 --> 00:01:18.770
<v Speaker 1>in terms of the nature of reality,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fundamental nature of reality,</v>

23
00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:20.420
<v Speaker 1>does God play dice?</v>

24
00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:26.100
<v Speaker 2>You don't know some fuck,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's your course.</v>

25
00:01:26.101 --> 00:01:29.450
<v Speaker 2>You don't know some doctors which could </v>
<v Speaker 2>be important.</v>

26
00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:33.930
<v Speaker 2>It looks like a good way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>nice,</v>

27
00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:40.090
<v Speaker 2>but we don't discourage it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you must distinguish between two </v>

28
00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:43.620
<v Speaker 2>positions,</v>
<v Speaker 2>positions of instrument,</v>

29
00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:49.810
<v Speaker 2>where you're creating,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it will production in positional for </v>

30
00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:53.700
<v Speaker 2>areas where you're trying to understand </v>
<v Speaker 2>what God did,</v>

31
00:01:54.650 --> 00:01:57.470
<v Speaker 1>can you describe instrumental and </v>
<v Speaker 1>realism a little bit?</v>

32
00:01:58.420 --> 00:02:00.890
<v Speaker 2>For example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you have some,</v>

33
00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:06.820
<v Speaker 2>because Nicole laws work is that is it </v>
<v Speaker 2>low each through always and everywhere </v>

34
00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:16.510
<v Speaker 2>or it is law which allow you to predict.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Position of moving element is what you </v>

35
00:02:22.011 --> 00:02:25.040
<v Speaker 2>believe.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You believe that it is God's law.</v>

36
00:02:25.710 --> 00:02:30.710
<v Speaker 2>God created the world which are the two,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this physical law or it is just low for </v>

37
00:02:35.031 --> 00:02:37.580
<v Speaker 2>predictions and which one is </v>
<v Speaker 2>instrumental?</v>

38
00:02:37.581 --> 00:02:42.581
<v Speaker 2>Asm for predictions,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is law of God.</v>

39
00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:48.590
<v Speaker 2>It isn't always true everywhere.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That means you're the artist so you're </v>

40
00:02:50.391 --> 00:02:50.990
<v Speaker 2>trying to.</v>

41
00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:53.910
<v Speaker 1>I'm distant,</v>
<v Speaker 1>understands.</v>

42
00:02:54.220 --> 00:02:59.220
<v Speaker 1>Got Salt.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Say the way you see the world is as an </v>

43
00:02:59.220 --> 00:02:59.220
<v Speaker 1>instrumentalist,</v>

44
00:03:00.020 --> 00:03:02.660
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>are working for someone else,</v>

45
00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:08.250
<v Speaker 1>model of machine learning.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So in Zeus model you can see a second,</v>

46
00:03:12.980 --> 00:03:17.980
<v Speaker 1>the soul is the second assault is a </v>
<v Speaker 1>problem and you can do in two different </v>

47
00:03:19.910 --> 00:03:24.910
<v Speaker 1>way from the point of view of </v>
<v Speaker 1>instrumentalists and that's what </v>

48
00:03:25.240 --> 00:03:27.820
<v Speaker 1>everybody does,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not because,</v>

49
00:03:28.100 --> 00:03:33.100
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is a goal of machine learning is a </v>

50
00:03:33.550 --> 00:03:38.550
<v Speaker 1>find zero for clarification,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that the bucket is instrument for </v>

51
00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:44.780
<v Speaker 1>production,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they can say Zygote of a machine </v>

52
00:03:45.611 --> 00:03:49.840
<v Speaker 1>learning is to learn about conditional </v>
<v Speaker 1>probability.</v>

53
00:03:50.010 --> 00:03:55.010
<v Speaker 1>So I have got played use in play.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What your probability for one,</v>

54
00:03:55.980 --> 00:04:00.980
<v Speaker 1>what is a given situation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But for production,</v>

55
00:04:01.181 --> 00:04:03.590
<v Speaker 1>I don't need this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I need zero,</v>

56
00:04:04.240 --> 00:04:07.370
<v Speaker 1>but for understanding I need </v>
<v Speaker 1>conditioner.</v>

57
00:04:08.490 --> 00:04:11.640
<v Speaker 1>So let me just step back a little bit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>First to talk about,</v>

58
00:04:11.820 --> 00:04:14.010
<v Speaker 1>you mentioned,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which I read last night,</v>

59
00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:19.040
<v Speaker 1>the parts of the 1960 paper by a eugene,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a wagner,</v>

60
00:04:20.790 --> 00:04:25.070
<v Speaker 1>a unreasonable effectiveness of </v>
<v Speaker 1>mathematics and natural sciences because</v>

61
00:04:25.110 --> 00:04:28.680
<v Speaker 1>you're such a beautiful paper by the </v>
<v Speaker 1>way.</v>

62
00:04:28.681 --> 00:04:33.681
<v Speaker 1>You made me feel it to be honest,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to confess my own work in the past few </v>

63
00:04:35.550 --> 00:04:37.860
<v Speaker 1>years on deep learning,</v>
<v Speaker 1>heavily applied,</v>

64
00:04:38.430 --> 00:04:43.430
<v Speaker 1>made me feel that I was missing out on </v>
<v Speaker 1>some of the beauty of nature in the way </v>

65
00:04:44.011 --> 00:04:49.011
<v Speaker 1>that math can uncover.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So let me just step away from the </v>

66
00:04:49.011 --> 00:04:53.720
<v Speaker 1>poacher that for a second.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How do you see the role of math in your </v>

67
00:04:53.720 --> 00:04:57.501
<v Speaker 1>life as it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is it a tool as a poetry where where </v>

68
00:04:57.501 --> 00:05:01.101
<v Speaker 1>does it sit and does math for you?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Have limits of what it can describe</v>

69
00:05:01.360 --> 00:05:06.360
<v Speaker 2>some people singing each user growth,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I believe</v>

70
00:05:10.120 --> 00:05:13.330
<v Speaker 1>and that to God or use God used God.</v>

71
00:05:14.030 --> 00:05:19.030
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I believe the zoo's article about </v>

72
00:05:24.291 --> 00:05:29.291
<v Speaker 2>effectiveness,</v>
<v Speaker 2>unreasonable effectiveness of mass is </v>

73
00:05:29.291 --> 00:05:31.940
<v Speaker 2>that if you're looking for in which a </v>
<v Speaker 2>magical structures,</v>

74
00:05:33.880 --> 00:05:38.880
<v Speaker 2>so ignore something Kubota and </v>
<v Speaker 2>scientists from natural science zero </v>

75
00:05:42.760 --> 00:05:47.760
<v Speaker 2>looking on equation in trying to </v>
<v Speaker 2>understand sort of the same in machine </v>

76
00:05:49.521 --> 00:05:54.160
<v Speaker 2>learning.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you really cared,</v>

77
00:05:54.400 --> 00:05:59.400
<v Speaker 2>if we look on all the equations,</v>
<v Speaker 2>did you define conditional probability?</v>

78
00:06:00.590 --> 00:06:04.220
<v Speaker 2>You can understand something in both the</v>
<v Speaker 2>reality,</v>

79
00:06:04.670 --> 00:06:07.760
<v Speaker 2>more zen from your fantasy.</v>

80
00:06:08.130 --> 00:06:13.110
<v Speaker 1>So math can reveal the simple underlying</v>
<v Speaker 1>principles of reality.</v>

81
00:06:13.111 --> 00:06:13.740
<v Speaker 1>Perhaps</v>

82
00:06:13.830 --> 00:06:18.780
<v Speaker 2>you know what mean simple,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it is very hard to disclose,</v>

83
00:06:20.310 --> 00:06:23.160
<v Speaker 2>but then when you discover them and look</v>
<v Speaker 2>at them,</v>

84
00:06:23.780 --> 00:06:28.780
<v Speaker 2>you see a beautiful that are in it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The surprising white people did not </v>

85
00:06:31.740 --> 00:06:36.630
<v Speaker 2>choose that before you're looking </v>
<v Speaker 2>equation derived from equations.</v>

86
00:06:37.470 --> 00:06:42.470
<v Speaker 2>For example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I talked to yesterday about Netapp and </v>

87
00:06:43.560 --> 00:06:47.430
<v Speaker 2>people had a lot of fantasy improve,</v>
<v Speaker 2>coordinate,</v>

88
00:06:48.120 --> 00:06:51.750
<v Speaker 2>but if you look going step by step by </v>
<v Speaker 2>solving some equations,</v>

89
00:06:52.350 --> 00:06:57.350
<v Speaker 2>you're suddenly,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you get some term which of the sinking </v>

90
00:06:59.070 --> 00:07:04.070
<v Speaker 2>your stands in describe position of </v>
<v Speaker 2>observation point wrote a lot of </v>

91
00:07:07.021 --> 00:07:12.021
<v Speaker 2>information.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You don't look in composition of points </v>

92
00:07:12.021 --> 00:07:14.040
<v Speaker 2>of observations.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're looking commonly on residuals,</v>

93
00:07:14.580 --> 00:07:19.580
<v Speaker 2>but when your understood that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's a very simple idea but not too </v>

94
00:07:20.430 --> 00:07:25.430
<v Speaker 2>simple to understand.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you can derive this just for </v>

95
00:07:25.430 --> 00:07:25.550
<v Speaker 2>mcorigins.</v>

96
00:07:25.650 --> 00:07:30.650
<v Speaker 1>So some simple Algebra,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a few steps or take you to something </v>

97
00:07:30.650 --> 00:07:32.510
<v Speaker 1>surprising that when you think about</v>

98
00:07:33.130 --> 00:07:38.130
<v Speaker 2>so am that is proof that human intuition</v>
<v Speaker 2>not to reach in very primitive and it </v>

99
00:07:42.911 --> 00:07:47.911
<v Speaker 2>does not see where it says simple </v>
<v Speaker 2>situations.</v>

100
00:07:48.520 --> 00:07:48.970
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

101
00:07:49.090 --> 00:07:51.530
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let me take a step back in general.</v>

102
00:07:51.680 --> 00:07:53.300
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

103
00:07:53.390 --> 00:07:58.390
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but what about human as opposed to </v>

104
00:07:58.390 --> 00:07:58.940
<v Speaker 1>intuition,</v>
<v Speaker 1>ingenuity,</v>

105
00:07:59.540 --> 00:08:02.990
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>moments of brilliance.</v>

106
00:08:03.020 --> 00:08:05.690
<v Speaker 1>So I use.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

107
00:08:06.350 --> 00:08:11.350
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do you have to be so hard on human </v>

108
00:08:11.350 --> 00:08:13.631
<v Speaker 1>intuition?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Are there moments of brilliance and </v>

109
00:08:13.631 --> 00:08:15.941
<v Speaker 1>human intuition that can leap ahead of </v>
<v Speaker 1>math and then the math will catch up?</v>

110
00:08:17.350 --> 00:08:22.350
<v Speaker 2>I don't think so.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I assume the best human intuition it is </v>

111
00:08:24.120 --> 00:08:29.120
<v Speaker 2>putting in Oxford homes and technical </v>
<v Speaker 2>where see where they axioms take you,</v>

112
00:08:31.880 --> 00:08:36.880
<v Speaker 2>but if they take actions but it ducks </v>
<v Speaker 2>your Polish during generation or </v>

113
00:08:39.991 --> 00:08:43.270
<v Speaker 2>scientist,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and this is integral,</v>

114
00:08:45.080 --> 00:08:50.080
<v Speaker 1>so that's beautifully put.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But if you maybe look at when you,</v>

115
00:08:51.520 --> 00:08:56.520
<v Speaker 1>when you think of Einstein and special,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

116
00:08:56.820 --> 00:09:01.820
<v Speaker 1>what is the role of imagination coming </v>
<v Speaker 1>first there in the moment of discovery </v>

117
00:09:02.611 --> 00:09:07.611
<v Speaker 1>of an idea.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So there's obviously a mix of math and </v>

118
00:09:07.980 --> 00:09:09.810
<v Speaker 1>out of the box imagination there</v>

119
00:09:10.780 --> 00:09:15.780
<v Speaker 2>that's a good goal or exclude you </v>
<v Speaker 2>because whatever is so emotional </v>

120
00:09:20.180 --> 00:09:25.180
<v Speaker 2>learning conference nation like futures,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like the deeper nick looked at it,</v>

121
00:09:27.250 --> 00:09:32.250
<v Speaker 2>what was a problem when you're looking </v>
<v Speaker 2>vertically from Maki,</v>

122
00:09:32.450 --> 00:09:34.670
<v Speaker 2>magical liquidations,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you did arrive,</v>

123
00:09:34.710 --> 00:09:38.560
<v Speaker 2>been converted.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Simple story usually goes fall by God.</v>

124
00:09:38.580 --> 00:09:42.520
<v Speaker 2>It's good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then whatever people can imagine because</v>

125
00:09:42.580 --> 00:09:47.580
<v Speaker 2>it is not good frontage,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it is just interpretation is just fun </v>

126
00:09:47.660 --> 00:09:51.010
<v Speaker 2>things,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it is not what you need.</v>

127
00:09:51.310 --> 00:09:56.310
<v Speaker 2>You don't need any imagination to derive</v>
<v Speaker 2>a say.</v>

128
00:09:56.951 --> 00:09:58.660
<v Speaker 2>My principal of machine learning.</v>

129
00:09:59.890 --> 00:10:02.350
<v Speaker 1>When you think about learning and </v>
<v Speaker 1>intelligence,</v>

130
00:10:02.740 --> 00:10:07.740
<v Speaker 1>maybe thinking about the human brain and</v>
<v Speaker 1>trying to describe mathematically the </v>

131
00:10:07.740 --> 00:10:08.570
<v Speaker 1>process of learning,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

132
00:10:09.220 --> 00:10:12.940
<v Speaker 1>that is something like what happens in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the human brain.</v>

133
00:10:13.210 --> 00:10:15.670
<v Speaker 1>Do you think we have the tools </v>
<v Speaker 1>currently?</v>

134
00:10:17.230 --> 00:10:22.230
<v Speaker 1>Do you think we'll ever have the tools </v>
<v Speaker 1>to try to describe that process of </v>

135
00:10:22.230 --> 00:10:22.230
<v Speaker 1>learning?</v>

136
00:10:22.230 --> 00:10:26.630
<v Speaker 2>You descriptions was growing up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was interpretation.</v>

137
00:10:27.340 --> 00:10:31.370
<v Speaker 2>It is your interpretation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Your vision can be wrong.</v>

138
00:10:32.090 --> 00:10:37.090
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when God microscope living book for the </v>

139
00:10:37.890 --> 00:10:41.620
<v Speaker 2>first time just instrument and nobody </v>
<v Speaker 2>will.</v>

140
00:10:41.630 --> 00:10:46.630
<v Speaker 2>He kept secret about microscope,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but he wrote reports in London sites and</v>

141
00:10:49.290 --> 00:10:52.130
<v Speaker 2>excuse the report.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When he looked and goes a blood heel.</v>

142
00:10:52.170 --> 00:10:57.170
<v Speaker 2>Look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>every barrels of water owns or blood on </v>

143
00:10:57.170 --> 00:10:59.840
<v Speaker 2>him,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but he described blood like fight </v>

144
00:10:59.990 --> 00:11:04.990
<v Speaker 2>between you and king.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So he saw blood cells,</v>

145
00:11:07.310 --> 00:11:11.260
<v Speaker 2>red cells and modules that is mute,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think chose it.</v>

146
00:11:12.460 --> 00:11:14.830
<v Speaker 2>And before his interpretation of </v>
<v Speaker 2>litigation,</v>

147
00:11:17.030 --> 00:11:21.810
<v Speaker 2>and she sent it yesterday in no signs </v>
<v Speaker 2>and they are very creative for your look</v>

148
00:11:21.830 --> 00:11:24.050
<v Speaker 2>because they believes that he's right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's right.</v>

149
00:11:24.080 --> 00:11:25.560
<v Speaker 2>You saw something,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yes,</v>

150
00:11:25.700 --> 00:11:29.960
<v Speaker 2>but keep going from interpretation and </v>
<v Speaker 2>they believe the same can happen.</v>

151
00:11:30.460 --> 00:11:34.490
<v Speaker 2>His brain,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what is the most important.</v>

152
00:11:34.491 --> 00:11:38.240
<v Speaker 2>But you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I believe in human language,</v>

153
00:11:38.880 --> 00:11:43.880
<v Speaker 2>in some product is so much this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>For example,</v>

154
00:11:45.200 --> 00:11:50.200
<v Speaker 2>people say that it is better than </v>
<v Speaker 2>thousand days of diligence studies one </v>

155
00:11:51.771 --> 00:11:56.771
<v Speaker 2>day this great.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But if I ask you what did you does?</v>

156
00:11:57.610 --> 00:12:02.610
<v Speaker 2>Nobody knows and that this intelligence </v>
<v Speaker 2>and but we know from Houston and now </v>

157
00:12:05.550 --> 00:12:06.960
<v Speaker 2>from,</v>
<v Speaker 2>from,</v>

158
00:12:07.120 --> 00:12:11.710
<v Speaker 2>in machine learning is that teachers can</v>
<v Speaker 2>do a lot.</v>

159
00:12:12.090 --> 00:12:15.630
<v Speaker 1>So what from a mathematical point of </v>
<v Speaker 1>view is the great teacher.</v>

160
00:12:16.120 --> 00:12:18.830
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's not,</v>

161
00:12:18.870 --> 00:12:23.870
<v Speaker 2>not what have.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can see what teachers can do.</v>

162
00:12:25.150 --> 00:12:27.610
<v Speaker 2>You can introduce some,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

163
00:12:28.420 --> 00:12:33.040
<v Speaker 2>some medicate for creating convergence.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Have you doing,</v>

164
00:12:33.570 --> 00:12:38.570
<v Speaker 2>I dunno because teacher nor seriality </v>
<v Speaker 2>and can describe from this reality </v>

165
00:12:39.190 --> 00:12:44.190
<v Speaker 2>predicate in variance.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But he knows that when you're using </v>

166
00:12:44.190 --> 00:12:47.200
<v Speaker 2>convenient you can decrease the number </v>
<v Speaker 2>of observations hundred times.</v>

167
00:12:48.040 --> 00:12:48.430
<v Speaker 2>That's</v>

168
00:12:49.360 --> 00:12:51.150
<v Speaker 1>so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but uh,</v>

169
00:12:51.280 --> 00:12:52.990
<v Speaker 1>maybe try to pull that apart a little </v>
<v Speaker 1>bit.</v>

170
00:12:52.991 --> 00:12:56.390
<v Speaker 1>I think you mentioned a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like a piano teacher saying,</v>

171
00:12:56.410 --> 00:12:57.320
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

172
00:12:57.520 --> 00:13:00.670
<v Speaker 1>to the student play like a butterfly and</v>
<v Speaker 1>I played piano.</v>

173
00:13:00.671 --> 00:13:04.300
<v Speaker 1>I play guitar for a long time and it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

174
00:13:04.301 --> 00:13:08.710
<v Speaker 1>that's theirs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe it's romantic,</v>

175
00:13:08.740 --> 00:13:11.710
<v Speaker 1>poetic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it feels like there's a lot of truth</v>

176
00:13:11.711 --> 00:13:16.711
<v Speaker 1>in that statement.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like there is a lot of instruction to </v>

177
00:13:16.711 --> 00:13:17.350
<v Speaker 1>that statement and so can you pull that </v>
<v Speaker 1>apart?</v>

178
00:13:17.380 --> 00:13:18.010
<v Speaker 1>What is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what,</v>

179
00:13:18.070 --> 00:13:23.070
<v Speaker 1>what is that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>The language itself may not contains </v>

180
00:13:23.070 --> 00:13:23.070
<v Speaker 1>information.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

181
00:13:23.070 --> 00:13:25.000
<v Speaker 2>Blah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Blah Blah because blah,</v>

182
00:13:25.050 --> 00:13:25.630
<v Speaker 2>blah blah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

183
00:13:27.010 --> 00:13:29.640
<v Speaker 2>It's what if you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you blank.</v>

184
00:13:29.870 --> 00:13:31.430
<v Speaker 1>Yes it does,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but what?</v>

185
00:13:31.431 --> 00:13:34.800
<v Speaker 1>It's not the lane.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's if it feels like a,</v>

186
00:13:34.801 --> 00:13:39.801
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what is the information being exchanged </v>

187
00:13:39.801 --> 00:13:39.830
<v Speaker 1>and error?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What is the nature of information?</v>

188
00:13:39.831 --> 00:13:41.900
<v Speaker 1>What is the representation of that </v>
<v Speaker 1>information?</v>

189
00:13:41.940 --> 00:13:46.940
<v Speaker 2>I believe sort of educated,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I don't know exactly what work </v>

190
00:13:47.520 --> 00:13:49.350
<v Speaker 2>intelligence and machine learning should</v>
<v Speaker 2>be.</v>

191
00:13:49.550 --> 00:13:52.550
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because this is just what you might call</v>

192
00:13:53.900 --> 00:13:58.900
<v Speaker 2>a.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What was discovered recently is that </v>

193
00:13:58.900 --> 00:14:03.900
<v Speaker 2>there is offloading one called stone </v>
<v Speaker 2>convergence mechanism and conversions.</v>

194
00:14:07.610 --> 00:14:12.610
<v Speaker 2>Macanese before people use only one.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you can go just because using you can</v>

195
00:14:13.861 --> 00:14:18.861
<v Speaker 2>use educate,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's what plainly bought the land and </v>

196
00:14:20.550 --> 00:14:25.550
<v Speaker 2>if you immediately affect your plan,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you'll also see soon as English program.</v>

197
00:14:26.400 --> 00:14:31.400
<v Speaker 2>Great.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It looks like the dark sleeves like the </v>

198
00:14:31.400 --> 00:14:35.010
<v Speaker 2>dark and walk like a duck then it is </v>
<v Speaker 2>probably duck.</v>

199
00:14:35.180 --> 00:14:37.910
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But this is exact.</v>

200
00:14:38.890 --> 00:14:41.640
<v Speaker 2>Put indicates.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Looks like a duck.</v>

201
00:14:41.670 --> 00:14:43.230
<v Speaker 2>What it means.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you,</v>

202
00:14:43.231 --> 00:14:47.670
<v Speaker 2>so many dogs that you're training data.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you're,</v>

203
00:14:47.970 --> 00:14:52.970
<v Speaker 2>you have description or hub looks.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Integral looks ducks.</v>

204
00:14:56.500 --> 00:14:59.020
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The visual characteristics of yard.</v>

205
00:14:59.380 --> 00:15:00.610
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But you won't.</v>

206
00:15:00.820 --> 00:15:03.520
<v Speaker 2>And you'll have modeled for,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

207
00:15:04.210 --> 00:15:08.250
<v Speaker 2>so you would like show that theoretical </v>
<v Speaker 2>description for more.</v>

208
00:15:08.320 --> 00:15:12.850
<v Speaker 2>The core site is empirical description </v>
<v Speaker 2>each year.</v>

209
00:15:12.851 --> 00:15:17.740
<v Speaker 2>So on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So about looks like the it general.</v>

210
00:15:18.460 --> 00:15:20.470
<v Speaker 2>But what about,</v>
<v Speaker 2>seems like a doc.</v>

211
00:15:21.490 --> 00:15:24.970
<v Speaker 2>You should know the dogs names.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can say it.</v>

212
00:15:24.971 --> 00:15:26.920
<v Speaker 2>Play chess like a duck.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

213
00:15:26.980 --> 00:15:28.480
<v Speaker 2>Doug doesn't relate.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

214
00:15:28.900 --> 00:15:33.060
<v Speaker 2>And it is completely legal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Educate,</v>

215
00:15:33.160 --> 00:15:38.160
<v Speaker 2>but it is useless.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So how teachers can recognize not </v>

216
00:15:39.161 --> 00:15:44.161
<v Speaker 2>useless.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So up to now you don't use this in </v>

217
00:15:45.030 --> 00:15:50.030
<v Speaker 2>existing machine a lot and you have data</v>
<v Speaker 2>but English forever use.</v>

218
00:15:55.390 --> 00:16:00.390
<v Speaker 2>It looks like a duck.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Seems like a duck and quacks collecting </v>

219
00:16:00.390 --> 00:16:00.390
<v Speaker 2>that</v>

220
00:16:00.390 --> 00:16:03.570
<v Speaker 1>so you can't deny the fact that swims </v>
<v Speaker 1>like a duck and quacks like a duck,</v>

221
00:16:04.200 --> 00:16:08.040
<v Speaker 1>has humor in it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>has an ambiguity.</v>

222
00:16:08.520 --> 00:16:13.520
<v Speaker 2>Let's talk about sitting duck in.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't say jumps,</v>

223
00:16:14.500 --> 00:16:17.020
<v Speaker 2>jumping duck.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why?</v>

224
00:16:17.710 --> 00:16:18.250
<v Speaker 2>Because</v>

225
00:16:18.310 --> 00:16:19.210
<v Speaker 1>it's not relevant,</v>

226
00:16:20.820 --> 00:16:22.600
<v Speaker 2>but music,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

227
00:16:22.840 --> 00:16:24.850
<v Speaker 2>dogs,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

228
00:16:24.880 --> 00:16:29.830
<v Speaker 2>different doors you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and your mouth and you derive from it is</v>

229
00:16:29.900 --> 00:16:31.840
<v Speaker 2>really want to say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>say like in jail.</v>

230
00:16:32.400 --> 00:16:36.060
<v Speaker 1>So underneath,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in order for us to understand swims like</v>

231
00:16:36.061 --> 00:16:41.061
<v Speaker 1>a duck,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it feels like we need to know millions </v>

232
00:16:41.061 --> 00:16:44.340
<v Speaker 1>of other little pieces of information we</v>
<v Speaker 1>pick up along the way.</v>

233
00:16:44.341 --> 00:16:46.020
<v Speaker 1>You don't think so that doesn't need to </v>
<v Speaker 1>be.</v>

234
00:16:46.021 --> 00:16:51.021
<v Speaker 1>This knowledge base in those statements </v>
<v Speaker 1>carries some rich information that helps</v>

235
00:16:53.221 --> 00:16:55.440
<v Speaker 1>us understand the essence of duck.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

236
00:16:57.300 --> 00:17:01.380
<v Speaker 1>How far are we from integrating a </v>
<v Speaker 1>product gets,</v>

237
00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:03.580
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when,</v>

238
00:17:03.670 --> 00:17:06.400
<v Speaker 2>when you consider complete sewer </v>
<v Speaker 2>machine.</v>

239
00:17:07.360 --> 00:17:10.990
<v Speaker 2>So what does you have?</v>
<v Speaker 2>A lot of functions.</v>

240
00:17:12.480 --> 00:17:13.670
<v Speaker 2>And then you're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're,</v>

241
00:17:13.720 --> 00:17:16.270
<v Speaker 2>you're talking,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it looks like a duck.</v>

242
00:17:17.520 --> 00:17:21.750
<v Speaker 2>You see your three new data from </v>
<v Speaker 2>training data.</v>

243
00:17:21.760 --> 00:17:24.210
<v Speaker 2>You recognize his life.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

244
00:17:26.450 --> 00:17:31.450
<v Speaker 2>expected dark should look all functions </v>
<v Speaker 2>did,</v>

245
00:17:33.750 --> 00:17:38.750
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>does not look like you think it should </v>

246
00:17:38.750 --> 00:17:43.051
<v Speaker 2>look from staining it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you could use a multifunction from </v>

247
00:17:43.070 --> 00:17:48.070
<v Speaker 2>vhp pickup,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what you a second predicate and they pay</v>

248
00:17:49.060 --> 00:17:52.560
<v Speaker 2>this could decrease the second function </v>
<v Speaker 2>enough to that.</v>

249
00:17:52.590 --> 00:17:55.980
<v Speaker 2>You a function,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can find it.</v>

250
00:17:55.981 --> 00:18:00.981
<v Speaker 2>Just stunned that machine learning.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So why are you need not too many </v>

251
00:18:00.981 --> 00:18:01.740
<v Speaker 2>examples</v>

252
00:18:03.360 --> 00:18:04.770
<v Speaker 1>is your products aren't very good,</v>

253
00:18:06.960 --> 00:18:08.470
<v Speaker 2>Mrs.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

254
00:18:09.210 --> 00:18:14.210
<v Speaker 2>because every political is invented to </v>
<v Speaker 2>decrease it leaseable set of function.</v>

255
00:18:17.720 --> 00:18:20.360
<v Speaker 1>So you talk about admissible set of </v>
<v Speaker 1>functions.</v>

256
00:18:20.361 --> 00:18:24.260
<v Speaker 1>Can you talk about good functions?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what makes a good function?</v>

257
00:18:24.280 --> 00:18:28.000
<v Speaker 2>So admissible set of function is circle </v>
<v Speaker 2>function.</v>

258
00:18:28.630 --> 00:18:32.790
<v Speaker 2>You chose small capacity of small </v>
<v Speaker 2>diversity.</v>

259
00:18:33.040 --> 00:18:36.580
<v Speaker 2>She did mention except did you continue </v>
<v Speaker 2>to good function,</v>

260
00:18:36.600 --> 00:18:36.910
<v Speaker 2>etc.</v>

261
00:18:36.970 --> 00:18:38.770
<v Speaker 1>So by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for people who don't know,</v>

262
00:18:38.810 --> 00:18:42.400
<v Speaker 1>vc,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're the v in the vc.</v>

263
00:18:43.580 --> 00:18:44.920
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh.</v>

264
00:18:44.921 --> 00:18:45.730
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

265
00:18:46.210 --> 00:18:49.130
<v Speaker 1>how would you describe to a lay person?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What vc theories,</v>

266
00:18:49.140 --> 00:18:51.580
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how would you describe these?</v>

267
00:18:51.940 --> 00:18:56.940
<v Speaker 2>We're mushroom,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so machine capable to pick up one </v>

268
00:18:58.511 --> 00:19:00.840
<v Speaker 2>function from zed miscible,</v>
<v Speaker 2>settler reflection.</v>

269
00:19:02.580 --> 00:19:07.580
<v Speaker 2>But certified miserables function can be</v>
<v Speaker 2>contained.</v>

270
00:19:08.800 --> 00:19:13.800
<v Speaker 2>All continuous functions in useless.</v>
<v Speaker 2>you don't have so many examples to pick </v>

271
00:19:13.971 --> 00:19:16.540
<v Speaker 2>up watch,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it can be small,</v>

272
00:19:17.320 --> 00:19:19.610
<v Speaker 2>small,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

273
00:19:20.500 --> 00:19:23.920
<v Speaker 2>because capacity,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but maybe better diversity,</v>

274
00:19:24.610 --> 00:19:29.610
<v Speaker 2>so not very different function in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>function but not very diverse.</v>

275
00:19:31.320 --> 00:19:35.220
<v Speaker 2>So if it's small,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you shouldn't mention when you mentioned</v>

276
00:19:35.230 --> 00:19:40.230
<v Speaker 2>a small union,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you union smaller moment of training </v>

277
00:19:40.500 --> 00:19:45.500
<v Speaker 2>data sources.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The goal is to create admissible set of </v>

278
00:19:46.001 --> 00:19:51.001
<v Speaker 2>functions.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Ditch is small vishy dimension and </v>

279
00:19:51.461 --> 00:19:54.370
<v Speaker 2>contained good zoom.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You should use it.</v>

280
00:19:54.460 --> 00:19:59.460
<v Speaker 2>You'll be able to pick up the function </v>
<v Speaker 2>using a small amount of sort of</v>

281
00:20:02.340 --> 00:20:07.340
<v Speaker 1>is that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that is the task of learning is creating</v>

282
00:20:08.131 --> 00:20:12.960
<v Speaker 1>a set of admissible functions as a small</v>
<v Speaker 1>vc dimension.</v>

283
00:20:13.110 --> 00:20:16.530
<v Speaker 1>And then you've figured out a clever way</v>
<v Speaker 1>of picking up</v>

284
00:20:17.390 --> 00:20:21.610
<v Speaker 2>the is that this goal of learning which </v>
<v Speaker 2>a fully formulated yesterday?</v>

285
00:20:21.660 --> 00:20:26.660
<v Speaker 2>Yep.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Statistical learning surgery does not </v>

286
00:20:26.660 --> 00:20:30.730
<v Speaker 2>involved in creating admissible set.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The function in classical learning </v>

287
00:20:31.581 --> 00:20:36.581
<v Speaker 2>surgery everywhere.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hundred percent in textbook is a set of </v>

288
00:20:36.581 --> 00:20:38.450
<v Speaker 2>function.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Admissible central function is given,</v>

289
00:20:39.200 --> 00:20:44.200
<v Speaker 2>but this is both nothing because the </v>
<v Speaker 2>most difficult problem to create </v>

290
00:20:44.691 --> 00:20:49.691
<v Speaker 2>admissible setup functions given see a </v>
<v Speaker 2>lot of functions continuum set up,</v>

291
00:20:52.210 --> 00:20:54.970
<v Speaker 2>auction create admissible central </v>
<v Speaker 2>functions.</v>

292
00:20:54.971 --> 00:20:59.971
<v Speaker 2>That's been the key is finding it to be </v>
<v Speaker 2>small and contained good function.</v>

293
00:21:02.210 --> 00:21:04.960
<v Speaker 2>So this was out of consideration.</v>

294
00:21:05.240 --> 00:21:07.460
<v Speaker 1>So what's the process of doing that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

295
00:21:07.461 --> 00:21:10.340
<v Speaker 1>it's fascinating.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What is the process of creating this,</v>

296
00:21:10.900 --> 00:21:15.900
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>admissible set of functions that's in </v>

297
00:21:15.900 --> 00:21:17.180
<v Speaker 1>various.</v>
<v Speaker 1>can you describe the variance</v>

298
00:21:18.490 --> 00:21:23.490
<v Speaker 2>of appropriate use of data in a proper </v>
<v Speaker 2>just means is that you have some </v>

299
00:21:28.650 --> 00:21:32.730
<v Speaker 2>function in your,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're just cold.</v>

300
00:21:33.270 --> 00:21:38.270
<v Speaker 2>What does your aVerage,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your function on your kind of model in </v>

301
00:21:41.881 --> 00:21:44.180
<v Speaker 2>what is the expectation of this function</v>
<v Speaker 2>on some,</v>

302
00:21:44.500 --> 00:21:49.500
<v Speaker 2>on set so that the problem was bold.</v>
<v Speaker 2>HaVe to piCk up functions.</v>

303
00:21:51.710 --> 00:21:54.520
<v Speaker 2>It can be in yoU.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Fuck you,</v>

304
00:21:56.620 --> 00:22:01.620
<v Speaker 2>fuck you for all functions.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But because when talking,</v>

305
00:22:04.680 --> 00:22:09.480
<v Speaker 2>see doug does not jumping so you don't </v>
<v Speaker 2>ask questions,</v>

306
00:22:09.510 --> 00:22:14.510
<v Speaker 2>jump like a duck because if this three </v>
<v Speaker 2>really doesn't the junk and from doesn't</v>

307
00:22:14.790 --> 00:22:19.790
<v Speaker 2>help you mature nor something vg task </v>
<v Speaker 2>you're asking for you like figure it </v>

308
00:22:23.490 --> 00:22:28.490
<v Speaker 2>like a duck but looks like a duck.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It haS general looks like see go.</v>

309
00:22:31.201 --> 00:22:35.010
<v Speaker 2>Who covers his illness?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is this disease?</v>

310
00:22:35.500 --> 00:22:38.490
<v Speaker 2>It says legal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

311
00:22:38.910 --> 00:22:43.910
<v Speaker 2>So there is a general type of political </v>
<v Speaker 2>groups like in specific special nikki,</v>

312
00:22:47.280 --> 00:22:52.280
<v Speaker 2>which he related to this specific and </v>
<v Speaker 2>his intelligence,</v>

313
00:22:52.381 --> 00:22:55.740
<v Speaker 2>but also business and that were teachers</v>
<v Speaker 2>involved.</v>

314
00:22:56.310 --> 00:23:00.120
<v Speaker 1>Incorporating the specialized predicates</v>
<v Speaker 1>a.</v>

315
00:23:00.570 --> 00:23:03.650
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What do you think about deep learning as</v>

316
00:23:04.530 --> 00:23:09.300
<v Speaker 1>a neural networks,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these arbitrary architectures as helping</v>

317
00:23:09.301 --> 00:23:14.301
<v Speaker 1>accomplish some of the tasks you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>thinking about their effectiveness or </v>

318
00:23:14.341 --> 00:23:15.420
<v Speaker 1>lack thereof?</v>
<v Speaker 1>what are,</v>

319
00:23:15.840 --> 00:23:19.410
<v Speaker 1>what are the weaknesses and what are the</v>
<v Speaker 1>possible strengths?</v>

320
00:23:20.140 --> 00:23:22.020
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is fun.</v>

321
00:23:23.460 --> 00:23:28.230
<v Speaker 2>Everybody seems huge.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Deep learning like futures.</v>

322
00:23:29.130 --> 00:23:34.130
<v Speaker 2>Let me give you this example.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One of the greatest book is churchill </v>

323
00:23:36.090 --> 00:23:40.680
<v Speaker 2>book about history of second world war </v>
<v Speaker 2>and he starting this book,</v>

324
00:23:41.760 --> 00:23:46.730
<v Speaker 2>describing that in old time when the war</v>
<v Speaker 2>is over,</v>

325
00:23:48.020 --> 00:23:53.020
<v Speaker 2>so the great kings together,</v>
<v Speaker 2>almost all of them were relatives and </v>

326
00:23:58.181 --> 00:24:03.181
<v Speaker 2>they discuss what should be done,</v>
<v Speaker 2>have to create peace and they came to an</v>

327
00:24:04.101 --> 00:24:09.101
<v Speaker 2>agreement in what happens for the </v>
<v Speaker 2>general public came in,</v>

328
00:24:12.660 --> 00:24:17.660
<v Speaker 2>bought in.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They were so good that rope Germany and </v>

329
00:24:18.400 --> 00:24:23.400
<v Speaker 2>it was clear for everybody that it is </v>
<v Speaker 2>not peace that peaceful last only 20 </v>

330
00:24:23.661 --> 00:24:28.661
<v Speaker 2>years because they was not professionals</v>
<v Speaker 2>in the same way.</v>

331
00:24:29.451 --> 00:24:33.520
<v Speaker 2>She in machine learning zarama,</v>
<v Speaker 2>zara mathematicians,</v>

332
00:24:33.860 --> 00:24:38.860
<v Speaker 2>we're looking for the problem from a </v>
<v Speaker 2>very deep point of your magical point </v>

333
00:24:39.990 --> 00:24:44.990
<v Speaker 2>and zara computer scientists,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's mostly does not know market is.</v>

334
00:24:46.370 --> 00:24:51.370
<v Speaker 2>They just have interpretation of that </v>
<v Speaker 2>and they invented a lot of blablabla </v>

335
00:24:51.630 --> 00:24:56.600
<v Speaker 2>interpretations like deep learning,</v>
<v Speaker 2>deep learning does not know.</v>

336
00:24:56.601 --> 00:25:00.590
<v Speaker 2>Deploying which you might have,</v>
<v Speaker 2>does not know a neurons.</v>

337
00:25:00.770 --> 00:25:05.390
<v Speaker 2>It is just function if you like to say </v>
<v Speaker 2>piecewise linear function,</v>

338
00:25:05.391 --> 00:25:10.220
<v Speaker 2>say that and do it in class of piecewise</v>
<v Speaker 2>linear function,</v>

339
00:25:10.820 --> 00:25:15.820
<v Speaker 2>but they went something and then they </v>
<v Speaker 2>try to to to proof advantage of that </v>

340
00:25:18.740 --> 00:25:23.740
<v Speaker 2>through interpretations which mostly </v>
<v Speaker 2>wrong and again they appeal to brain </v>

341
00:25:25.750 --> 00:25:29.840
<v Speaker 2>which they know nothing about that </v>
<v Speaker 2>nobody knows what god can break,</v>

342
00:25:30.350 --> 00:25:34.110
<v Speaker 2>so I think that more reliable woke en </v>
<v Speaker 2>masse.</v>

343
00:25:34.610 --> 00:25:38.710
<v Speaker 2>There's as much scope problem or do your</v>
<v Speaker 2>best to solve this problem.</v>

344
00:25:39.440 --> 00:25:44.440
<v Speaker 2>Try to understand that there is no only </v>
<v Speaker 2>one way of convergence which is strong </v>

345
00:25:45.130 --> 00:25:49.610
<v Speaker 2>wave of euphoria of conductors which </v>
<v Speaker 2>requires predicate.</v>

346
00:25:49.920 --> 00:25:54.920
<v Speaker 2>If you will go through all this stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you will see that you don't need even </v>

347
00:25:56.841 --> 00:26:00.500
<v Speaker 2>more.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was one of the tour him.</v>

348
00:26:01.000 --> 00:26:06.000
<v Speaker 2>Each color presented theory.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It says that optimal solution of logical</v>

349
00:26:09.840 --> 00:26:12.320
<v Speaker 2>problem,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is,</v>

350
00:26:12.900 --> 00:26:17.900
<v Speaker 2>would you describe lord ngukurr,</v>
<v Speaker 2>his own shuttle network,</v>

351
00:26:19.520 --> 00:26:22.320
<v Speaker 2>not on deep learning and a shower.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Again,</v>

352
00:26:23.000 --> 00:26:24.770
<v Speaker 1>problem is there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Absolutely.</v>

353
00:26:24.771 --> 00:26:28.580
<v Speaker 1>So in the end,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what you're saying is exactly right.</v>

354
00:26:29.330 --> 00:26:34.330
<v Speaker 1>The question is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have no value for throwing something</v>

355
00:26:34.401 --> 00:26:37.670
<v Speaker 1>on the table playing with it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not math.</v>

356
00:26:38.080 --> 00:26:43.080
<v Speaker 1>So like in your network or you said </v>
<v Speaker 1>throwing something in the bucket and </v>

357
00:26:43.080 --> 00:26:43.080
<v Speaker 1>our,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

358
00:26:43.080 --> 00:26:46.140
<v Speaker 1>by the biological example in looking at </v>
<v Speaker 1>kings and queens with the cells,</v>

359
00:26:46.141 --> 00:26:51.141
<v Speaker 1>with a microscope you don't see value in</v>
<v Speaker 1>imagining the cells are kings and </v>

360
00:26:51.271 --> 00:26:56.271
<v Speaker 1>queens.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And using that as inspiration and </v>

361
00:26:56.271 --> 00:26:58.860
<v Speaker 1>imagination for where the math will </v>
<v Speaker 1>eventually lead you.</v>

362
00:26:59.070 --> 00:27:04.070
<v Speaker 1>You think that interpretation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who was basically deceives you in a way </v>

363
00:27:04.171 --> 00:27:05.310
<v Speaker 1>that's not productive</v>

364
00:27:06.340 --> 00:27:11.340
<v Speaker 2>are soon.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you're on the laws of nature,</v>

365
00:27:12.620 --> 00:27:17.620
<v Speaker 2>of a spiritually discussion about </v>
<v Speaker 2>deploying it was discussion about </v>

366
00:27:19.531 --> 00:27:23.730
<v Speaker 2>interpretation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Not the boat sinks your boat.</v>

367
00:27:23.760 --> 00:27:25.690
<v Speaker 2>What you can say about sings.</v>

368
00:27:26.110 --> 00:27:31.110
<v Speaker 1>That's right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But aren't you surprised by the beauty </v>

369
00:27:31.110 --> 00:27:31.110
<v Speaker 1>of it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the,</v>

370
00:27:31.110 --> 00:27:31.110
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

371
00:27:31.110 --> 00:27:32.560
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not mathematical beauty,</v>

372
00:27:32.561 --> 00:27:37.561
<v Speaker 1>but the fact that it Works at all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or are you criticizing that very beauty?</v>

373
00:27:38.921 --> 00:27:43.921
<v Speaker 1>Our human desire to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to interpret,</v>

374
00:27:44.540 --> 00:27:49.540
<v Speaker 1>to find our silly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>silly interpretations and these </v>

375
00:27:49.540 --> 00:27:50.650
<v Speaker 1>constructs like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let me ask you this,</v>

376
00:27:51.280 --> 00:27:56.280
<v Speaker 1>are you surprised in that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Does it inspire you or how do you feel </v>

377
00:27:57.641 --> 00:28:02.641
<v Speaker 1>about the success of a system like </v>
<v Speaker 1>alphago beating the game of go using </v>

378
00:28:04.120 --> 00:28:09.120
<v Speaker 1>neural networks to estimate the quality </v>
<v Speaker 1>of a board of a board and the quality of</v>

379
00:28:11.141 --> 00:28:14.830
<v Speaker 1>the interpretation coordinator support?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

380
00:28:15.070 --> 00:28:19.840
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's not our interpretation.</v>

381
00:28:20.230 --> 00:28:22.540
<v Speaker 1>The fact is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you're on our system,</v>

382
00:28:22.541 --> 00:28:25.930
<v Speaker 1>doesn't matter.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A learning system that we don't.</v>

383
00:28:25.931 --> 00:28:30.931
<v Speaker 1>I think mathematically understand that </v>
<v Speaker 1>well beat the best human player does </v>

384
00:28:30.931 --> 00:28:30.931
<v Speaker 1>something that was,</v>

385
00:28:32.100 --> 00:28:33.260
<v Speaker 2>it's not very difficult.</v>

386
00:28:34.210 --> 00:28:39.210
<v Speaker 1>That's so you empiric.</v>
<v Speaker 1>we've empirically have discovered that </v>

387
00:28:39.210 --> 00:28:42.670
<v Speaker 1>this is not a very difficult problem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's true.</v>

388
00:28:42.980 --> 00:28:46.990
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so maybe can't argue.</v>

389
00:28:47.040 --> 00:28:49.990
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so</v>

390
00:28:50.180 --> 00:28:54.070
<v Speaker 2>you would more obviously the user uses </v>
<v Speaker 2>the polluting.</v>

391
00:28:54.730 --> 00:28:59.730
<v Speaker 2>It is not the most effective way of </v>
<v Speaker 2>learning theory and usually when people </v>

392
00:29:02.181 --> 00:29:07.181
<v Speaker 2>use the learning using zillions of </v>
<v Speaker 2>training data,</v>

393
00:29:10.300 --> 00:29:15.300
<v Speaker 2>but you don't need this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I guess challenge generally do some </v>

394
00:29:17.270 --> 00:29:22.270
<v Speaker 2>problems.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Did you do real deep learning method?</v>

395
00:29:22.880 --> 00:29:27.880
<v Speaker 2>You are using contract terms lists even </v>
<v Speaker 2>more.</v>

396
00:29:29.490 --> 00:29:34.490
<v Speaker 2>Some problems deploying cannot solve </v>
<v Speaker 2>because it's not necessarily z create </v>

397
00:29:38.700 --> 00:29:41.550
<v Speaker 2>admissible set of function.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When creek</v>

398
00:29:42.030 --> 00:29:45.310
<v Speaker 3>deep architecture muesli created </v>
<v Speaker 3>miscible set of functions,</v>

399
00:29:45.730 --> 00:29:48.480
<v Speaker 3>you cannot say that you create in good,</v>
<v Speaker 3>admissible setup,</v>

400
00:29:50.210 --> 00:29:53.990
<v Speaker 3>you're just a ceo fantasy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It does not come from us,</v>

401
00:29:54.820 --> 00:29:59.140
<v Speaker 3>but it is possible to create ugly </v>
<v Speaker 3>stubble set of functions and because you</v>

402
00:29:59.141 --> 00:30:04.141
<v Speaker 3>have a training data that the actually </v>
<v Speaker 3>for magicians,</v>

403
00:30:04.760 --> 00:30:08.060
<v Speaker 3>a run,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're considering warrior,</v>

404
00:30:08.360 --> 00:30:13.360
<v Speaker 3>you need to use law of large numbers </v>
<v Speaker 3>when you making training in existing </v>

405
00:30:16.490 --> 00:30:19.990
<v Speaker 3>algorithm,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uniform law of large numbers,</v>

406
00:30:20.710 --> 00:30:24.490
<v Speaker 3>which is much more difficult to acquire.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So we said imagine and all that stuff,</v>

407
00:30:25.060 --> 00:30:30.060
<v Speaker 3>but never the less.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you use morse code stroke way of </v>

408
00:30:32.291 --> 00:30:34.830
<v Speaker 3>convergence,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can decrease a lot of training data.</v>

409
00:30:34.980 --> 00:30:36.420
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you could do the three.</v>

410
00:30:36.480 --> 00:30:39.090
<v Speaker 1>This one was like a duck,</v>
<v Speaker 1>quacks like a duck,</v>

411
00:30:39.570 --> 00:30:41.730
<v Speaker 1>but are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So let's,</v>

412
00:30:41.750 --> 00:30:45.780
<v Speaker 1>let's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's step back and think about intel.</v>

413
00:30:45.810 --> 00:30:50.810
<v Speaker 1>Human intelligence in general.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Clearly that has evolved in a non </v>

414
00:30:51.421 --> 00:30:54.690
<v Speaker 1>mathematical way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It wasn't,</v>

415
00:30:54.750 --> 00:30:56.790
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as far as we know,</v>

416
00:30:57.210 --> 00:30:58.310
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>god,</v>

417
00:30:58.340 --> 00:30:59.210
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or,</v>

418
00:30:59.230 --> 00:31:04.230
<v Speaker 1>or,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or whoever didn't come up with a model </v>

419
00:31:04.230 --> 00:31:05.850
<v Speaker 1>in place in our brain of admissible </v>
<v Speaker 1>functions.</v>

420
00:31:05.851 --> 00:31:07.110
<v Speaker 1>It kind of evolved.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know,</v>

421
00:31:07.111 --> 00:31:08.700
<v Speaker 1>maybe you have a view on this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but.</v>

422
00:31:09.600 --> 00:31:13.290
<v Speaker 1>So alan turing in the fifties,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in his paper,</v>

423
00:31:13.291 --> 00:31:18.291
<v Speaker 1>I'm asked and rejected the question,</v>
<v Speaker 1>can machines think it's not a very </v>

424
00:31:18.291 --> 00:31:22.881
<v Speaker 1>useful question,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but can you briefly entertain this </v>

425
00:31:22.881 --> 00:31:23.370
<v Speaker 1>useful,</v>
<v Speaker 1>useless question.</v>

426
00:31:24.000 --> 00:31:28.110
<v Speaker 1>Can machines think?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So talk about intelligence and your vieW</v>

427
00:31:28.111 --> 00:31:28.500
<v Speaker 1>of it.</v>

428
00:31:28.610 --> 00:31:31.370
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Hearing,</v>

429
00:31:32.210 --> 00:31:37.210
<v Speaker 3>describe imitation computer can imitate </v>
<v Speaker 3>human being.</v>

430
00:31:39.740 --> 00:31:44.740
<v Speaker 3>Let's call it intelligent and he </v>
<v Speaker 3>understands that it is not sinking </v>

431
00:31:44.991 --> 00:31:46.040
<v Speaker 3>computer.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>

432
00:31:46.440 --> 00:31:51.440
<v Speaker 3>He completely understand what he does,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but he's set up problem of imitation so </v>

433
00:31:54.160 --> 00:31:56.570
<v Speaker 3>long.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He understands that the problem,</v>

434
00:31:56.571 --> 00:32:01.571
<v Speaker 3>not in limitation.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not sure that intelligence just </v>

435
00:32:02.481 --> 00:32:06.170
<v Speaker 3>inside of us.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It might be all soft side of us.</v>

436
00:32:06.710 --> 00:32:11.710
<v Speaker 3>I have several observations.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So when they approved some sodium,</v>

437
00:32:13.500 --> 00:32:14.180
<v Speaker 3>difficult,</v>
<v Speaker 3>sorry,</v>

438
00:32:15.160 --> 00:32:20.160
<v Speaker 3>a couple of years in several places,</v>
<v Speaker 3>people pull off the same sorta loma </v>

439
00:32:24.260 --> 00:32:29.260
<v Speaker 3>after ours was done in other guys in the</v>
<v Speaker 3>history of science.</v>

440
00:32:30.261 --> 00:32:33.050
<v Speaker 3>It's happened all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>For example,</v>

441
00:32:33.300 --> 00:32:38.300
<v Speaker 3>john certain similar foster did a little</v>
<v Speaker 3>and goals and [inaudible] and another </v>

442
00:32:42.050 --> 00:32:47.050
<v Speaker 3>guy in the approximately in 10 times </v>
<v Speaker 3>video taped up the spirit of time.</v>

443
00:32:48.520 --> 00:32:53.520
<v Speaker 3>If they saw a lot of examples like that </v>
<v Speaker 3>in which my tuition wednesday develop </v>

444
00:32:54.951 --> 00:32:59.951
<v Speaker 3>something big sampson,</v>
<v Speaker 3>congenital ditch effect everybody.</v>

445
00:33:01.430 --> 00:33:06.430
<v Speaker 3>So maybe you're our models.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It intelligence only inside the foss is </v>

446
00:33:06.430 --> 00:33:08.480
<v Speaker 3>incorrect.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's our interpretation.</v>

447
00:33:08.600 --> 00:33:12.920
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It might be some connection.</v>

448
00:33:13.590 --> 00:33:16.490
<v Speaker 3>You wold intelligence,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>

449
00:33:16.570 --> 00:33:19.850
<v Speaker 3>You're almost like plugging in into a.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

450
00:33:19.851 --> 00:33:24.851
<v Speaker 3>exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And contributing to this network to a </v>

451
00:33:24.851 --> 00:33:26.180
<v Speaker 3>big maybe in your own network.</v>

452
00:33:28.250 --> 00:33:33.250
<v Speaker 3>And the flip side of that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>maybe you can comment on a big old </v>

453
00:33:33.921 --> 00:33:38.840
<v Speaker 3>complexity in how you see classifying </v>
<v Speaker 3>algorithms by worst case,</v>

454
00:33:38.841 --> 00:33:43.841
<v Speaker 3>running time in relation to their input.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So that way of thinking about functions.</v>

455
00:33:45.620 --> 00:33:47.750
<v Speaker 3>Do you think p equals np?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Do you think?</v>

456
00:33:47.751 --> 00:33:51.440
<v Speaker 3>That's an interesting question.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was interesting coalition,</v>

457
00:33:51.800 --> 00:33:56.800
<v Speaker 3>but let me talk about complexity.</v>
<v Speaker 3>In the worst case scenario,</v>

458
00:34:01.760 --> 00:34:06.760
<v Speaker 3>zoos in which you might circle setting </v>
<v Speaker 3>when they came to the United States in </v>

459
00:34:06.760 --> 00:34:11.081
<v Speaker 3>1990,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so people did not know this show is I </v>

460
00:34:11.081 --> 00:34:15.031
<v Speaker 3>get not no statistical lot.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So in Russia it was published two </v>

461
00:34:15.600 --> 00:34:16.810
<v Speaker 3>motocross.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

462
00:34:17.000 --> 00:34:21.190
<v Speaker 3>one more grass,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but in America said that no zinzi lord,</v>

463
00:34:22.970 --> 00:34:26.010
<v Speaker 3>and somebody told me the worst case </v>
<v Speaker 3>scenario,</v>

464
00:34:26.290 --> 00:34:27.220
<v Speaker 3>create three.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay,</v>

465
00:34:27.230 --> 00:34:32.230
<v Speaker 3>so what do it not,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because it is much in what's called </v>

466
00:34:32.960 --> 00:34:37.960
<v Speaker 3>tool.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can do only what you can do using </v>

467
00:34:37.960 --> 00:34:42.080
<v Speaker 3>the markings and ditch [inaudible] a </v>
<v Speaker 3>clear understanding and clear </v>

468
00:34:42.591 --> 00:34:47.591
<v Speaker 3>description and for some reason the </v>
<v Speaker 3>introduce complexity and didn't he just </v>

469
00:34:54.580 --> 00:34:59.580
<v Speaker 3>because using.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Actually it is diverse like this one </v>

470
00:35:01.190 --> 00:35:04.190
<v Speaker 3>more dimension.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can pro sodiums,</v>

471
00:35:05.090 --> 00:35:10.090
<v Speaker 3>but we also create order for case when </v>
<v Speaker 3>you low probability to measure is that </v>

472
00:35:13.070 --> 00:35:15.720
<v Speaker 3>the best case which can happen at the </v>
<v Speaker 3>same therapy.</v>

473
00:35:16.040 --> 00:35:21.040
<v Speaker 3>Stability.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So from which you might scope point of </v>

474
00:35:21.040 --> 00:35:24.570
<v Speaker 3>view,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know the best possible case is the </v>

475
00:35:24.570 --> 00:35:27.921
<v Speaker 3>worst possible case.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can have different model in medium </v>

476
00:35:28.490 --> 00:35:32.940
<v Speaker 3>but not so interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You think that the edges are interesting</v>

477
00:35:33.210 --> 00:35:35.760
<v Speaker 3>and yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just because</v>

478
00:35:38.480 --> 00:35:42.440
<v Speaker 3>it is not so easy to get</v>

479
00:35:42.630 --> 00:35:44.230
<v Speaker 1>good bob,</v>
<v Speaker 1>exact boat.</v>

480
00:35:44.520 --> 00:35:49.520
<v Speaker 1>It's not my crisis or where you up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but interesting principles.</v>

481
00:35:51.810 --> 00:35:56.810
<v Speaker 1>Did you discover the moss?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you think it's interesting because </v>

482
00:35:56.810 --> 00:36:01.611
<v Speaker 1>it's challenging and reveals interesting</v>
<v Speaker 1>principles that allow you to get those </v>

483
00:36:01.611 --> 00:36:04.500
<v Speaker 1>bounds?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Or do you think it's interesting because</v>

484
00:36:04.501 --> 00:36:09.501
<v Speaker 1>it's actually very useful for </v>
<v Speaker 1>understanding the essence of a function </v>

485
00:36:09.501 --> 00:36:09.780
<v Speaker 1>of a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of an algorithm.</v>

486
00:36:10.950 --> 00:36:15.950
<v Speaker 1>So it's like me judging your life as a </v>
<v Speaker 1>human Being by the worst thing he did in</v>

487
00:36:17.371 --> 00:36:20.640
<v Speaker 1>the best thing he did versus all the </v>
<v Speaker 1>stuff in the middle.</v>

488
00:36:21.720 --> 00:36:24.540
<v Speaker 1>It seems a not productive</v>

489
00:36:25.510 --> 00:36:30.510
<v Speaker 3>are those things.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So because you can not describe the </v>

490
00:36:30.510 --> 00:36:33.960
<v Speaker 3>situation in the middle or not general.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So you can describe it just,</v>

491
00:36:38.910 --> 00:36:43.910
<v Speaker 3>and it is clear because some model,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you cannot describe model for every </v>

492
00:36:45.611 --> 00:36:49.010
<v Speaker 3>new case.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So you're,</v>

493
00:36:49.100 --> 00:36:52.690
<v Speaker 3>you'll be nervous when you're using</v>

494
00:36:52.750 --> 00:36:55.090
<v Speaker 1>mortal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But from a statistical point of view,</v>

495
00:36:55.091 --> 00:36:56.930
<v Speaker 1>the way you've studied,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

496
00:36:57.250 --> 00:37:01.870
<v Speaker 1>functions and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the nature of learning in the world,</v>

497
00:37:01.930 --> 00:37:06.640
<v Speaker 1>don't you think that the real world has </v>
<v Speaker 1>a very long tail,</v>

498
00:37:07.450 --> 00:37:12.450
<v Speaker 1>that the edge cases are very far away </v>
<v Speaker 1>from the mean the stuff in the middle </v>

499
00:37:16.790 --> 00:37:17.270
<v Speaker 1>or.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

500
00:37:20.870 --> 00:37:25.870
<v Speaker 3>because as soon as you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which from my point of view,</v>

501
00:37:30.160 --> 00:37:35.160
<v Speaker 3>if you use formal statistic,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you uniform wolf lodge,</v>

502
00:37:40.240 --> 00:37:45.240
<v Speaker 3>if you will use,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is this in avoidance business,</v>

503
00:37:48.310 --> 00:37:53.310
<v Speaker 3>you've just flushed homeless.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You don't have this huge difference </v>

504
00:37:53.481 --> 00:37:54.540
<v Speaker 3>between uniform law.</v>

505
00:37:56.700 --> 00:38:00.840
<v Speaker 1>Is it useful to describe that a little </v>
<v Speaker 1>more or it will show we just take it to,</v>

506
00:38:01.740 --> 00:38:03.150
<v Speaker 3>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when,</v>

507
00:38:03.280 --> 00:38:07.740
<v Speaker 3>when talking about doc I give city </v>
<v Speaker 3>pretty dedicated enough.</v>

508
00:38:09.600 --> 00:38:14.600
<v Speaker 3>but if you try to distinguish,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you didn't need a lot of observing.</v>

509
00:38:17.680 --> 00:38:18.330
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

510
00:38:18.830 --> 00:38:21.740
<v Speaker 3>and so does that means,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is that information?</v>

511
00:38:21.990 --> 00:38:26.990
<v Speaker 3>It looks like a duck contained a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 3>information form of bits of information.</v>

512
00:38:29.660 --> 00:38:32.240
<v Speaker 3>So if you don't know thAt,</v>

513
00:38:32.990 --> 00:38:35.180
<v Speaker 1>how much bit of information</v>

514
00:38:36.330 --> 00:38:40.210
<v Speaker 3>sinks from artificial intelligence is </v>
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>

515
00:38:40.211 --> 00:38:43.650
<v Speaker 3>does this album,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

516
00:38:46.020 --> 00:38:51.020
<v Speaker 3>old business are.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't like cuff people and she the </v>

517
00:38:52.620 --> 00:38:57.620
<v Speaker 3>artificial intelligence is consider us </v>
<v Speaker 3>some quotes which imitate activity or </v>

518
00:38:59.430 --> 00:39:02.280
<v Speaker 3>human being.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It is not science,</v>

519
00:39:02.800 --> 00:39:05.160
<v Speaker 3>which is applications you would like to </v>
<v Speaker 3>imitate.</v>

520
00:39:05.210 --> 00:39:08.990
<v Speaker 3>Go heretic is very useful.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was problem,</v>

521
00:39:09.450 --> 00:39:10.080
<v Speaker 3>but</v>

522
00:39:11.680 --> 00:39:16.680
<v Speaker 3>junior to to to lord substance more have</v>
<v Speaker 3>people try to do cricket.</v>

523
00:39:18.690 --> 00:39:23.690
<v Speaker 3>People came to see a pretty face,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so you just like a dock or play like </v>

524
00:39:26.460 --> 00:39:31.460
<v Speaker 3>butterfly or something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The teacher says you have it came in his</v>

525
00:39:33.111 --> 00:39:38.111
<v Speaker 3>mind how he chooses.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So that process is problem of </v>

526
00:39:38.811 --> 00:39:41.810
<v Speaker 3>intelligence.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That is the problem of intel and you see</v>

527
00:39:41.811 --> 00:39:46.811
<v Speaker 3>that connected to the problem of </v>
<v Speaker 3>learning options are they requested you </v>

528
00:39:46.811 --> 00:39:51.480
<v Speaker 3>immediately gives us predicate like a </v>
<v Speaker 3>specific predicate streams,</v>

529
00:39:51.530 --> 00:39:56.460
<v Speaker 3>like a dark hole.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You just choose it somehow.</v>

530
00:39:57.440 --> 00:40:00.170
<v Speaker 3>So what is the line of work would you </v>
<v Speaker 3>say?</v>

531
00:40:01.270 --> 00:40:06.270
<v Speaker 3>If you were to formulate it as a set of </v>
<v Speaker 3>open problems that will take us there,</v>

532
00:40:07.910 --> 00:40:08.990
<v Speaker 3>will play.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Look,</v>

533
00:40:09.000 --> 00:40:13.730
<v Speaker 3>a butterfly will get a system to be able</v>
<v Speaker 3>to look at two stories,</v>

534
00:40:14.330 --> 00:40:18.130
<v Speaker 3>one story,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the predicate.</v>

535
00:40:18.200 --> 00:40:23.200
<v Speaker 3>You can do something.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Then those stories have to get </v>

536
00:40:23.200 --> 00:40:26.980
<v Speaker 3>predicate.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It is intelligence problem and people </v>

537
00:40:28.280 --> 00:40:33.280
<v Speaker 3>even did not start the understanding </v>
<v Speaker 3>because to understand intelligence,</v>

538
00:40:34.260 --> 00:40:39.260
<v Speaker 3>the full try to understand what do </v>
<v Speaker 3>teachers of teacher teach via one </v>

539
00:40:41.810 --> 00:40:44.330
<v Speaker 3>teacher butlers in another one.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yup.</v>

540
00:40:44.450 --> 00:40:49.450
<v Speaker 3>And so you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you think we're really even haven't </v>

541
00:40:49.450 --> 00:40:50.440
<v Speaker 3>started on the journey of regenerating </v>
<v Speaker 3>the protocols.</v>

542
00:40:50.830 --> 00:40:54.790
<v Speaker 3>You don't understand.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You don't understand this problem exist</v>

543
00:40:56.600 --> 00:40:59.640
<v Speaker 3>because did you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>do you know,</v>

544
00:40:59.800 --> 00:41:04.800
<v Speaker 3>are you just normal name and I won't </v>
<v Speaker 3>understand a why one tissue,</v>

545
00:41:06.110 --> 00:41:11.110
<v Speaker 3>but in a teacher student,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not because he repeating zipparo boom,</v>

546
00:41:16.301 --> 00:41:18.190
<v Speaker 3>which isn't textbook.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yes,</v>

547
00:41:18.410 --> 00:41:22.400
<v Speaker 3>she makes somebody marks.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She makes some philosophy of,</v>

548
00:41:22.980 --> 00:41:24.470
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's a beautiful.</v>

549
00:41:24.530 --> 00:41:29.530
<v Speaker 3>So it is a formulation of a question </v>
<v Speaker 3>that is the open problem.</v>

550
00:41:31.280 --> 00:41:35.870
<v Speaker 3>Why is one teacher better than right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>What she does,</v>

551
00:41:35.871 --> 00:41:38.420
<v Speaker 3>but yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What,</v>

552
00:41:38.490 --> 00:41:39.060
<v Speaker 3>what,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what,</v>

553
00:41:39.620 --> 00:41:40.370
<v Speaker 3>what,</v>
<v Speaker 3>why?</v>

554
00:41:40.390 --> 00:41:44.480
<v Speaker 3>In every level people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how do they get better?</v>

555
00:41:44.810 --> 00:41:49.200
<v Speaker 3>What does it mean to be better?</v>
<v Speaker 3>The whole?</v>

556
00:41:49.280 --> 00:41:49.960
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

557
00:41:50.330 --> 00:41:52.840
<v Speaker 3>From,</v>
<v Speaker 3>from whatever model I have,</v>

558
00:41:53.990 --> 00:41:56.670
<v Speaker 3>one teacher can give a very good </v>
<v Speaker 3>predicate.</v>

559
00:41:56.700 --> 00:42:00.850
<v Speaker 3>My pitcher can say a severe selected doc</v>
<v Speaker 3>and it does,</v>

560
00:42:00.851 --> 00:42:05.851
<v Speaker 3>it can say jump like a duck and jump </v>
<v Speaker 3>like conducts cut a zero in front of me.</v>

561
00:42:07.100 --> 00:42:07.340
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

562
00:42:09.280 --> 00:42:14.280
<v Speaker 1>So what is the most exciting problem and</v>
<v Speaker 1>statistical learning you've ever worked </v>

563
00:42:14.280 --> 00:42:14.980
<v Speaker 1>on or are working on now?</v>

564
00:42:16.270 --> 00:42:21.270
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just feel years is either on story.</v>

565
00:42:24.630 --> 00:42:29.630
<v Speaker 3>I believe zipped it is loading story.</v>
<v Speaker 3>At least they can shows is that it </v>

566
00:42:34.070 --> 00:42:39.070
<v Speaker 3>doesn't nick nicole only what zay say </v>
<v Speaker 3>statistical bought from intelligent and </v>

567
00:42:45.070 --> 00:42:50.070
<v Speaker 3>they know nothing about intelligent and </v>
<v Speaker 3>you know there's intelligent bot so it </v>

568
00:42:53.071 --> 00:42:58.071
<v Speaker 3>you'll help us a lot in teaching in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>learning.</v>

569
00:43:00.480 --> 00:43:03.810
<v Speaker 3>so we'll know it when we see it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So for example,</v>

570
00:43:04.090 --> 00:43:06.600
<v Speaker 3>in my talks,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the last slide was a challenge.</v>

571
00:43:06.990 --> 00:43:11.990
<v Speaker 3>So you have say nist digitalization </v>
<v Speaker 3>problem and deploy new claims.</v>

572
00:43:13.981 --> 00:43:18.981
<v Speaker 3>If they did it very well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>say 99 point five percent of it correct </v>

573
00:43:20.401 --> 00:43:23.320
<v Speaker 3>answers,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but say you're 60,000</v>

574
00:43:23.330 --> 00:43:24.680
<v Speaker 3>to observational.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

575
00:43:25.170 --> 00:43:30.170
<v Speaker 3>Can you lose a sale user called </v>
<v Speaker 3>defenseless but incorporating things in </v>

576
00:43:30.810 --> 00:43:32.100
<v Speaker 3>variance.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What it means,</v>

577
00:43:32.130 --> 00:43:33.790
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>digital want to see.</v>

578
00:43:33.820 --> 00:43:38.820
<v Speaker 3>But yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just looking concert explained the </v>

579
00:43:38.820 --> 00:43:42.820
<v Speaker 3>vision.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The orientation would keep to use </v>

580
00:43:42.820 --> 00:43:46.560
<v Speaker 3>examples or say 100 times less examples </v>
<v Speaker 3>to do the same job.</v>

581
00:43:48.400 --> 00:43:51.820
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that last slide in a.</v>

582
00:43:51.850 --> 00:43:55.030
<v Speaker 1>Unfortunately you're talking too </v>
<v Speaker 1>quickly,</v>

583
00:43:55.031 --> 00:44:00.031
<v Speaker 1>but that last slide was a powerful open </v>
<v Speaker 1>challenge and a formulation of the </v>

584
00:44:01.361 --> 00:44:02.790
<v Speaker 1>essence does exactly</v>

585
00:44:02.880 --> 00:44:06.680
<v Speaker 3>problem often the diligence because</v>

586
00:44:08.740 --> 00:44:13.740
<v Speaker 3>everybody,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when nick started it was working with </v>

587
00:44:13.860 --> 00:44:18.860
<v Speaker 3>too much emotion.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Z immediately recognize that views use </v>

588
00:44:18.860 --> 00:44:21.320
<v Speaker 3>much more a trading datas of human </v>
<v Speaker 3>needed.</v>

589
00:44:22.430 --> 00:44:23.250
<v Speaker 3>but no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>again,</v>

590
00:44:23.280 --> 00:44:26.550
<v Speaker 3>we came to the same study have to </v>
<v Speaker 3>decrease.</v>

591
00:44:27.130 --> 00:44:30.900
<v Speaker 3>Is that this problem of loading?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It does,</v>

592
00:44:31.170 --> 00:44:34.960
<v Speaker 3>like in deploying the z subterranean </v>
<v Speaker 3>date,</v>

593
00:44:35.790 --> 00:44:38.070
<v Speaker 3>the cost,</v>
<v Speaker 3>my resilience of not enough.</v>

594
00:44:38.430 --> 00:44:42.810
<v Speaker 3>If you have a good,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

595
00:44:42.910 --> 00:44:47.910
<v Speaker 3>invariance might be,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you'll never collect some observations,</v>

596
00:44:49.380 --> 00:44:54.380
<v Speaker 3>but now it is a question to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to intelligence have to do that because </v>

597
00:44:56.191 --> 00:45:01.191
<v Speaker 3>statistical part is in here.</v>
<v Speaker 3>As soon as your suppliers this </v>

598
00:45:01.240 --> 00:45:05.090
<v Speaker 3>predicament,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can do good job in a small amount of</v>

599
00:45:05.370 --> 00:45:10.370
<v Speaker 3>observations as a very first challenges </v>
<v Speaker 3>will know digital coordination and you </v>

600
00:45:11.231 --> 00:45:14.070
<v Speaker 3>know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>digits and police,</v>

601
00:45:14.580 --> 00:45:19.580
<v Speaker 3>there'll be variance.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think that they can say four digit </v>

602
00:45:19.580 --> 00:45:23.340
<v Speaker 3>city.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I would introduce concept of horizontal </v>

603
00:45:24.031 --> 00:45:29.031
<v Speaker 3>symmetry.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it was a digital has horizontals,</v>

604
00:45:29.150 --> 00:45:32.940
<v Speaker 3>symmetry say malls and say digital or </v>
<v Speaker 3>something like that.</v>

605
00:45:34.440 --> 00:45:37.890
<v Speaker 3>but as soon as I get the deal is </v>
<v Speaker 3>announced symmetry,</v>

606
00:45:38.250 --> 00:45:43.250
<v Speaker 3>I can watch a lot of measure your senior</v>
<v Speaker 3>year or the organon cemetery or </v>

607
00:45:46.621 --> 00:45:48.720
<v Speaker 3>whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if I could ever deal cbt,</v>

608
00:45:49.860 --> 00:45:54.860
<v Speaker 3>but foretells looking on on on digital </v>
<v Speaker 3>use it.</v>

609
00:45:55.260 --> 00:45:57.520
<v Speaker 3>It is mit,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the mit,</v>

610
00:45:57.650 --> 00:46:02.650
<v Speaker 3>the predicate which is not shape the </v>
<v Speaker 3>subsidy lake cemetery,</v>

611
00:46:07.350 --> 00:46:10.130
<v Speaker 3>like half dark.</v>
<v Speaker 3>His whole pictures,</v>

612
00:46:10.131 --> 00:46:15.131
<v Speaker 3>something like that each can sell for as</v>
<v Speaker 3>a predicate.</v>

613
00:46:16.170 --> 00:46:21.170
<v Speaker 1>You think such a predicate could rise of</v>
<v Speaker 1>something that's a</v>

614
00:46:25.660 --> 00:46:28.270
<v Speaker 3>not general meaning</v>

615
00:46:29.690 --> 00:46:34.690
<v Speaker 1>it feels like for me to be able to </v>
<v Speaker 1>understand the difference between the </v>

616
00:46:34.690 --> 00:46:38.501
<v Speaker 1>two and three,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would need to have had a a childhood </v>

617
00:46:40.370 --> 00:46:45.370
<v Speaker 1>of 10 to 15 years playing with kids,</v>
<v Speaker 1>going to school,</v>

618
00:46:47.840 --> 00:46:52.840
<v Speaker 1>being yelled at by parents,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all of that walking,</v>

619
00:46:53.150 --> 00:46:58.150
<v Speaker 1>jumping,</v>
<v Speaker 1>looking at ducks and now then I will be </v>

620
00:46:58.150 --> 00:47:02.771
<v Speaker 1>able to generate the right predicate for</v>
<v Speaker 1>tying the difference between two and a </v>

621
00:47:02.771 --> 00:47:06.940
<v Speaker 1>three.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Or do you think there's a more </v>

622
00:47:06.940 --> 00:47:06.940
<v Speaker 1>efficient.</v>

623
00:47:06.940 --> 00:47:08.570
<v Speaker 3>Oh no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for sure.</v>

624
00:47:09.710 --> 00:47:13.390
<v Speaker 3>You must know some signals of digits yes</v>
<v Speaker 3>to.</v>

625
00:47:13.500 --> 00:47:18.500
<v Speaker 3>And that's a powerful state,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but maybe there are serval languages of </v>

626
00:47:19.611 --> 00:47:21.550
<v Speaker 3>description,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

627
00:47:22.510 --> 00:47:27.510
<v Speaker 3>elements of digits.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So you talking about symmetry </v>

628
00:47:28.650 --> 00:47:29.800
<v Speaker 3>properties,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Jordan,</v>

629
00:47:30.320 --> 00:47:33.850
<v Speaker 3>talking about some gaps there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know that,</v>

630
00:47:34.570 --> 00:47:39.570
<v Speaker 3>but this is a problem of intelligence.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So in one article it is revealed to show</v>

631
00:47:42.990 --> 00:47:47.990
<v Speaker 3>that every example can cut it not more </v>
<v Speaker 3>than one beautiful information in the </v>

632
00:47:49.151 --> 00:47:52.310
<v Speaker 3>hill because,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

633
00:47:52.600 --> 00:47:57.600
<v Speaker 3>with your show example,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and you say this is one you can remove a</v>

634
00:48:00.240 --> 00:48:05.240
<v Speaker 3>function which does not tell your mom </v>
<v Speaker 3>the best strategy if you can do it,</v>

635
00:48:06.530 --> 00:48:11.530
<v Speaker 3>the city move off of options.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But when you used one predicate which </v>

636
00:48:13.091 --> 00:48:18.091
<v Speaker 3>looks like a duck,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can remove much more functions in </v>

637
00:48:18.091 --> 00:48:19.450
<v Speaker 3>the cuff.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that to me,</v>

638
00:48:19.470 --> 00:48:24.470
<v Speaker 3>that did contain a lot of information </v>
<v Speaker 3>from formal point of view.</v>

639
00:48:25.930 --> 00:48:30.930
<v Speaker 3>But when you have a little picture what </v>
<v Speaker 3>you want to send general picture.</v>

640
00:48:34.830 --> 00:48:39.830
<v Speaker 3>So what can you just put indicate?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that predicates carter a lot of </v>

641
00:48:44.800 --> 00:48:45.020
<v Speaker 3>noise,</v>

642
00:48:47.200 --> 00:48:52.200
<v Speaker 3>beautifully put maybe just me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but in all the math you show in your </v>

643
00:48:52.931 --> 00:48:54.310
<v Speaker 3>work,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

644
00:48:54.580 --> 00:48:57.250
<v Speaker 3>which is some of the most profound </v>
<v Speaker 3>mathematical work in,</v>

645
00:48:57.251 --> 00:48:59.350
<v Speaker 3>in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in the field of learning ai.</v>

646
00:48:59.351 --> 00:49:04.280
<v Speaker 3>And just math in general,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I hear a lot of poetry and philosophy.</v>

647
00:49:04.290 --> 00:49:06.890
<v Speaker 3>You really kind of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

648
00:49:07.300 --> 00:49:09.400
<v Speaker 3>talk about philosophy of science.</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's a,</v>

649
00:49:09.710 --> 00:49:13.090
<v Speaker 3>there's a poetry and music to a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 3>the work you're doing and the way you're</v>

650
00:49:13.091 --> 00:49:14.770
<v Speaker 3>thinking about it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So do you.</v>

651
00:49:15.540 --> 00:49:18.850
<v Speaker 3>Where does that come from?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Do you to escape to poetry?</v>

652
00:49:18.851 --> 00:49:22.870
<v Speaker 3>Do you escape to music?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Doesn't exist.</v>

653
00:49:22.930 --> 00:49:27.930
<v Speaker 3>Ground truth,</v>
<v Speaker 3>ground truth is that get seen </v>

654
00:49:28.750 --> 00:49:29.940
<v Speaker 3>everywhere.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

655
00:49:30.670 --> 00:49:32.130
<v Speaker 3>The smart guy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>she lost them.</v>

656
00:49:32.140 --> 00:49:37.140
<v Speaker 3>Sometimes I surprise of the deep sea.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Sometimes some of them are completely </v>

657
00:49:42.740 --> 00:49:47.740
<v Speaker 3>out of subject,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but the sheet music,</v>

658
00:49:50.650 --> 00:49:55.650
<v Speaker 3>music is the ground truth be important </v>
<v Speaker 3>to you when you point z,</v>

659
00:49:56.410 --> 00:50:01.410
<v Speaker 3>z believes if they take dictation.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So what a piece of music as a piece of </v>

660
00:50:07.330 --> 00:50:10.930
<v Speaker 3>empirical evidence gave you a sense that</v>
<v Speaker 3>they are,</v>

661
00:50:10.931 --> 00:50:15.931
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're touching something in the </v>

662
00:50:15.931 --> 00:50:17.290
<v Speaker 3>ground.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Truth it to Structure the structure.</v>

663
00:50:18.400 --> 00:50:22.010
<v Speaker 3>Listening to bach structure.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

664
00:50:22.180 --> 00:50:24.100
<v Speaker 3>very,</v>
<v Speaker 3>very classic.</v>

665
00:50:24.101 --> 00:50:26.190
<v Speaker 3>Very simple.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was the same with,</v>

666
00:50:26.540 --> 00:50:31.540
<v Speaker 3>when you enjoying the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can just say the same.</v>

667
00:50:35.940 --> 00:50:37.120
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

668
00:50:38.200 --> 00:50:42.270
<v Speaker 1>and if you look back at your childhood,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you grew up in Russia,</v>

669
00:50:42.780 --> 00:50:46.140
<v Speaker 1>you maybe were born as a researcher in </v>
<v Speaker 1>Russia,</v>

670
00:50:46.230 --> 00:50:47.940
<v Speaker 1>you've developed as a researcher in </v>
<v Speaker 1>Russia,</v>

671
00:50:47.941 --> 00:50:51.090
<v Speaker 1>he came to United States in a few </v>
<v Speaker 1>places.</v>

672
00:50:51.780 --> 00:50:53.940
<v Speaker 1>If you look back,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what were,</v>

673
00:50:54.000 --> 00:50:58.410
<v Speaker 1>what was some of your happiest moments </v>
<v Speaker 1>as a researcher?</v>

674
00:50:59.520 --> 00:51:04.520
<v Speaker 1>Some of the most profound moments,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not in terms of their impact on society,</v>

675
00:51:06.240 --> 00:51:11.240
<v Speaker 1>but in terms of their impact on how damn</v>
<v Speaker 1>good you feel that day and you remember </v>

676
00:51:13.351 --> 00:51:13.950
<v Speaker 1>that moment,</v>

677
00:51:15.350 --> 00:51:19.340
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>every time when you followed something.</v>

678
00:51:21.060 --> 00:51:25.990
<v Speaker 3>It is great and everybody,</v>
<v Speaker 3>simple things,</v>

679
00:51:26.330 --> 00:51:28.890
<v Speaker 3>just like your little feelings that they</v>
<v Speaker 3>mostly,</v>

680
00:51:28.920 --> 00:51:33.920
<v Speaker 3>most of my time was broke.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You should go again and again and again </v>

681
00:51:35.250 --> 00:51:40.250
<v Speaker 3>and try to be honest with yourself,</v>
<v Speaker 3>look more contemporary,</v>

682
00:51:41.790 --> 00:51:45.260
<v Speaker 3>but try to understand that the new way </v>
<v Speaker 3>to grant,</v>

683
00:51:46.220 --> 00:51:49.330
<v Speaker 3>not marty,</v>
<v Speaker 3>blah,</v>

684
00:51:49.380 --> 00:51:50.070
<v Speaker 3>blah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>blah,</v>

685
00:51:51.210 --> 00:51:51.480
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>

686
00:51:52.540 --> 00:51:54.460
<v Speaker 1>But you're allowed to get excited at </v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

687
00:51:55.240 --> 00:51:59.410
<v Speaker 1>at the possibility of discovery here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You'll have to double check it.</v>

688
00:51:59.470 --> 00:52:00.190
<v Speaker 1>But uh,</v>

689
00:52:01.130 --> 00:52:04.070
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but covered related to throws.</v>

690
00:52:04.520 --> 00:52:09.520
<v Speaker 3>Is it just for hair?</v>
<v Speaker 3>But you know,</v>

691
00:52:11.300 --> 00:52:16.300
<v Speaker 3>you always have a feeling your phone,</v>
<v Speaker 3>something of that.</v>

692
00:52:19.670 --> 00:52:23.320
<v Speaker 3>So 20 years ago with the discovery of </v>
<v Speaker 3>statistical loading,</v>

693
00:52:23.360 --> 00:52:28.360
<v Speaker 3>so nobody believe except for one guy dr </v>
<v Speaker 3>jay and live in 20 years then became </v>

694
00:52:35.160 --> 00:52:38.840
<v Speaker 3>fashion is the same,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the support vector machines,</v>

695
00:52:40.460 --> 00:52:41.150
<v Speaker 3>machines.</v>

696
00:52:41.370 --> 00:52:46.370
<v Speaker 1>So what was supportive and machines are </v>
<v Speaker 1>learning theory with when you were </v>

697
00:52:46.651 --> 00:52:51.651
<v Speaker 1>working on it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you had a sense that you had a sense of </v>

698
00:52:53.370 --> 00:52:57.510
<v Speaker 1>the profundity of it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the how that this,</v>

699
00:52:57.550 --> 00:53:00.510
<v Speaker 1>this seems to be right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It seems to be powerful,</v>

700
00:53:00.610 --> 00:53:02.340
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Absolutely.</v>

701
00:53:02.870 --> 00:53:07.870
<v Speaker 3>Definitely lost waiver and know when </v>
<v Speaker 3>fallen zoos.</v>

702
00:53:14.230 --> 00:53:19.000
<v Speaker 3>In what story you feel the same </v>
