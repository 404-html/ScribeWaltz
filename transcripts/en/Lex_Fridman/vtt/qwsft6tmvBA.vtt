1
00:00:00.550 --> 00:00:03.940
<v Speaker 1>Today we're going to try something </v>
<v Speaker 1>different.</v>

2
00:00:04.030 --> 00:00:06.490
<v Speaker 1>We're going to try a conversation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

3
00:00:06.560 --> 00:00:11.560
<v Speaker 1>have a Lisa Feldman Barrett with us.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She is a university distinguished </v>

4
00:00:11.560 --> 00:00:13.360
<v Speaker 1>professor of psychology at Northeastern </v>
<v Speaker 1>University,</v>

5
00:00:13.630 --> 00:00:17.500
<v Speaker 1>director of the Interdisciplinary </v>
<v Speaker 1>Affective Science Laboratory,</v>

6
00:00:17.980 --> 00:00:21.070
<v Speaker 1>author of the new amazing book,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how emotions are made,</v>

7
00:00:21.071 --> 00:00:24.310
<v Speaker 1>the secret life of the brain.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She studies emotion,</v>

8
00:00:24.670 --> 00:00:29.260
<v Speaker 1>human emotion from social,</v>
<v Speaker 1>psychological,</v>

9
00:00:29.290 --> 00:00:31.600
<v Speaker 1>cognitive science and neuroscience </v>
<v Speaker 1>perspectives.</v>

10
00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:36.960
<v Speaker 1>And so I think our conversation may help</v>
<v Speaker 1>us gain intuition about how we instill </v>

11
00:00:39.250 --> 00:00:44.250
<v Speaker 1>emotional life into future artificial </v>
<v Speaker 1>intelligence systems as Josh Tannenbaum </v>

12
00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:48.230
<v Speaker 1>give you a shout out on Tuesday and said</v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

13
00:00:48.231 --> 00:00:53.231
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you want to understand how to create </v>

14
00:00:53.231 --> 00:00:55.400
<v Speaker 1>artificial general intelligence systems </v>
<v Speaker 1>from an engineering perspectives,</v>

15
00:00:55.401 --> 00:00:59.870
<v Speaker 1>which is study the human brain.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So with that,</v>

16
00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:05.410
<v Speaker 1>let's have some fun.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let me start with a curve ball to a </v>

17
00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:11.200
<v Speaker 1>conjure up an image of emotion.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Have you ever cried while watching a </v>

18
00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:13.190
<v Speaker 1>movie that you remember?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And what movie was it?</v>

19
00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:18.760
<v Speaker 2>I've cried during lots of.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

20
00:01:19.150 --> 00:01:22.160
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let me think.</v>

21
00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:27.470
<v Speaker 2>The last time I cried.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Actually,</v>

22
00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:32.530
<v Speaker 2>here's an interesting thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When I'm speaking about when I'm giving </v>

23
00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:36.560
<v Speaker 2>an academic talk,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I sometimes we'll talk about a study </v>

24
00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:40.241
<v Speaker 2>that we did where we had people watch </v>
<v Speaker 2>films and we have them watch the most </v>

25
00:01:40.241 --> 00:01:44.591
<v Speaker 2>evocative clips of films and there's </v>
<v Speaker 2>several clips that are really powerful </v>

26
00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:52.440
<v Speaker 2>and a couple of them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>every time I talk about them,</v>

27
00:01:52.441 --> 00:01:53.670
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to try not to cry.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now.</v>

28
00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:58.920
<v Speaker 2>Every time I talk about them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just scribing for the audience what </v>

29
00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:03.231
<v Speaker 2>subjects are seeing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One of the clips is from a movie called </v>

30
00:02:03.231 --> 00:02:04.710
<v Speaker 2>Sophie's choice.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Does anyone know this film?</v>

31
00:02:05.190 --> 00:02:10.190
<v Speaker 2>Raise your hand if you know this film.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So we show this is a film about a woman </v>

32
00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:14.870
<v Speaker 2>who is forced in a concentration camp to</v>
<v Speaker 2>choose which of her children will die in</v>

33
00:02:15.391 --> 00:02:16.290
<v Speaker 2>the gas chambers.</v>

34
00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:18.060
<v Speaker 2>And so I'm already,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

35
00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:20.430
<v Speaker 2>like if you were,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if I had um,</v>

36
00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:22.950
<v Speaker 2>heart rate monitor and respiration </v>
<v Speaker 2>monitor,</v>

37
00:02:22.951 --> 00:02:23.680
<v Speaker 2>you would see,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

38
00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:27.050
<v Speaker 2>like it's a really powerful scene.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

39
00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:31.320
<v Speaker 2>Meryl Streep is Sophie and it's very,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very evocative.</v>

40
00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:36.460
<v Speaker 2>We have,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we also show there's a scene from a,</v>

41
00:02:36.461 --> 00:02:41.461
<v Speaker 2>a film with Susan Surandon who is dying </v>
<v Speaker 2>of breast cancer and she has to tell her</v>

42
00:02:42.581 --> 00:02:46.330
<v Speaker 2>12 year old daughter that she's dying.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So there's another scene also that,</v>

43
00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:51.420
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that I find very compelling and you use </v>

44
00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:54.130
<v Speaker 2>these scenes to listen emotion as part </v>
<v Speaker 2>of experiments we do.</v>

45
00:02:54.190 --> 00:02:55.450
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And in fact,</v>

46
00:02:55.451 --> 00:03:00.451
<v Speaker 2>I was just giving a presentation to the </v>
<v Speaker 2>Judicial Court of Massachusetts on </v>

47
00:03:02.391 --> 00:03:07.391
<v Speaker 2>implicit bias and to start the year,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they wanted to understand the </v>

48
00:03:07.391 --> 00:03:11.921
<v Speaker 2>neuroscience of implicit bias and </v>
<v Speaker 2>whether or not they should be crafting </v>

49
00:03:11.921 --> 00:03:16.600
<v Speaker 2>jury instructions for juries to be aware</v>
<v Speaker 2>of implicit bias.</v>

50
00:03:17.810 --> 00:03:20.690
<v Speaker 2>And to open the discussion.</v>

51
00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:25.210
<v Speaker 2>I showed them a clip from a film that </v>
<v Speaker 2>was filmed a,</v>

52
00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:26.690
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>almost 20 years ago,</v>

53
00:03:26.691 --> 00:03:31.691
<v Speaker 2>actually called a time to kill the scene</v>
<v Speaker 2>where Matthew mcconaughey is this kind </v>

54
00:03:33.421 --> 00:03:38.421
<v Speaker 2>of his,</v>
<v Speaker 2>his closing statements in a case where </v>

55
00:03:38.421 --> 00:03:38.421
<v Speaker 2>he,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

56
00:03:38.421 --> 00:03:43.100
<v Speaker 2>is defending an African American man who</v>
<v Speaker 2>murdered two European American men who </v>

57
00:03:44.161 --> 00:03:47.490
<v Speaker 2>raped his 12 year old daughter.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so the scene is,</v>

58
00:03:47.550 --> 00:03:52.550
<v Speaker 2>he's this completely pathetic lawyer </v>
<v Speaker 2>until the end when he masters this </v>

59
00:03:52.741 --> 00:03:57.741
<v Speaker 2>fantastic defense.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Basically of this man on trial for,</v>

60
00:03:59.170 --> 00:04:04.170
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>basically avenging his daughter's death </v>

61
00:04:04.170 --> 00:04:06.840
<v Speaker 2>and that one I hadn't seen that for 20 </v>
<v Speaker 2>years that film and it brought me to </v>

62
00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:07.660
<v Speaker 2>tears.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Actually.</v>

63
00:04:07.960 --> 00:04:12.960
<v Speaker 2>It's just a really powerful,</v>
<v Speaker 2>powerful scene and it's just really </v>

64
00:04:12.960 --> 00:04:17.640
<v Speaker 2>punches you in the stomach.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You just can't help but just experienced</v>

65
00:04:17.641 --> 00:04:22.641
<v Speaker 2>that weight of racism in that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in that room and the brilliance of the </v>

66
00:04:22.641 --> 00:04:26.140
<v Speaker 2>closing argument to sort of puncture </v>
<v Speaker 2>through it basically.</v>

67
00:04:27.450 --> 00:04:29.310
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so experience.</v>

68
00:04:29.610 --> 00:04:34.610
<v Speaker 1>So one of the things you talk a lot and </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're working in your book is the </v>

69
00:04:34.610 --> 00:04:37.050
<v Speaker 1>difference in the experience of emotion </v>
<v Speaker 1>and the expression of emotion.</v>

70
00:04:38.300 --> 00:04:41.410
<v Speaker 1>So what are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's our biggest misconception?</v>

71
00:04:41.440 --> 00:04:44.060
<v Speaker 1>Bottom motion of folks that haven't </v>
<v Speaker 1>considered,</v>

72
00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:48.620
<v Speaker 1>have,</v>
<v Speaker 1>have only considered a emotions that are</v>

73
00:04:48.621 --> 00:04:49.400
<v Speaker 1>surface level.</v>

74
00:04:50.100 --> 00:04:55.100
<v Speaker 2>I would say one common misconception is </v>
<v Speaker 2>that you can look at someone's face and </v>

75
00:04:58.771 --> 00:05:03.660
<v Speaker 2>read their emotion the way you read </v>
<v Speaker 2>words on a page that everyone around the</v>

76
00:05:03.661 --> 00:05:05.520
<v Speaker 2>world,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when they're feeling angry,</v>

77
00:05:05.521 --> 00:05:07.950
<v Speaker 2>they scowl.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When they're feeling happy,</v>

78
00:05:07.951 --> 00:05:10.890
<v Speaker 2>they smile when they're feeling sad,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that they frown.</v>

79
00:05:11.100 --> 00:05:14.400
<v Speaker 2>The way that I'm saying it sounds </v>
<v Speaker 2>preposterous and it is preposterous,</v>

80
00:05:14.430 --> 00:05:16.710
<v Speaker 2>but unfortunately that is actually what </v>
<v Speaker 2>people,</v>

81
00:05:16.711 --> 00:05:21.711
<v Speaker 2>a lot of people believe,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and tech companies around the world </v>

82
00:05:21.711 --> 00:05:24.530
<v Speaker 2>spend tremendous amounts of money,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

83
00:05:24.610 --> 00:05:29.610
<v Speaker 2>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in the investment of some of the most </v>

84
00:05:29.610 --> 00:05:32.230
<v Speaker 2>creative people on this planet trying to</v>
<v Speaker 2>build emotion detection systems,</v>

85
00:05:32.710 --> 00:05:37.710
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when really what they're building are </v>

86
00:05:37.710 --> 00:05:39.571
<v Speaker 2>excellent systems for reading facial </v>
<v Speaker 2>movements which have no intrinsic </v>

87
00:05:39.571 --> 00:05:40.870
<v Speaker 2>emotional meeting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

88
00:05:40.871 --> 00:05:43.840
<v Speaker 2>sometimes facial movements communicate </v>
<v Speaker 2>emotion,</v>

89
00:05:43.841 --> 00:05:48.640
<v Speaker 2>but many times they don't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So people scowl for many reasons.</v>

90
00:05:48.850 --> 00:05:52.030
<v Speaker 2>They scowl when they're concentrating,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they scowl.</v>

91
00:05:52.031 --> 00:05:56.200
<v Speaker 2>Sometimes when they're sad,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they even can scowl when they're happy.</v>

92
00:05:56.440 --> 00:06:01.070
<v Speaker 2>People smile when they're angry,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they smile when they're sad.</v>

93
00:06:01.071 --> 00:06:02.660
<v Speaker 2>They don't just smile when they're </v>
<v Speaker 2>happy,</v>

94
00:06:02.661 --> 00:06:06.080
<v Speaker 2>they sometimes smile to indicate a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to send,</v>

95
00:06:06.340 --> 00:06:11.340
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a social message that has nothing to do </v>

96
00:06:11.340 --> 00:06:13.421
<v Speaker 2>with emotion.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so the idea that there's one </v>

97
00:06:13.421 --> 00:06:15.370
<v Speaker 2>universal facial expression,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for example,</v>

98
00:06:15.371 --> 00:06:16.780
<v Speaker 2>for each emotion is just,</v>

99
00:06:17.530 --> 00:06:22.530
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's no strong scientific evidence </v>

100
00:06:22.530 --> 00:06:22.530
<v Speaker 2>for that claim.</v>

101
00:06:22.530 --> 00:06:26.490
<v Speaker 1>So how is emotion created them?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because we nevertheless feel like we're </v>

102
00:06:26.490 --> 00:06:28.450
<v Speaker 1>observing emotional when we're </v>
<v Speaker 1>communicating with others.</v>

103
00:06:28.720 --> 00:06:33.720
<v Speaker 1>So how does emotion,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the creation of emotion change in the </v>

104
00:06:33.901 --> 00:06:36.350
<v Speaker 1>presence of others?</v>
<v Speaker 1>The,</v>

105
00:06:36.920 --> 00:06:39.650
<v Speaker 1>does the audience change the display of </v>
<v Speaker 1>emotion?</v>

106
00:06:39.651 --> 00:06:41.000
<v Speaker 1>Is that essentially in the message?</v>

107
00:06:41.550 --> 00:06:43.410
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>emotions are not displayed,</v>

108
00:06:43.770 --> 00:06:45.330
<v Speaker 2>I would say.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

109
00:06:45.331 --> 00:06:50.331
<v Speaker 2>So basically you and I are having a </v>
<v Speaker 2>conversation right now and part of what </v>

110
00:06:51.900 --> 00:06:54.420
<v Speaker 2>you know my brain is doing is it's </v>
<v Speaker 2>guessing,</v>

111
00:06:54.570 --> 00:06:58.020
<v Speaker 2>make making educated guesses about what </v>
<v Speaker 2>your facial movements mean.</v>

112
00:06:58.070 --> 00:07:00.240
<v Speaker 2>So right now you have a slight smile on </v>
<v Speaker 2>your face.</v>

113
00:07:00.241 --> 00:07:02.430
<v Speaker 2>Not exactly a smirk,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but um,</v>

114
00:07:03.640 --> 00:07:05.940
<v Speaker 2>and so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

115
00:07:06.130 --> 00:07:08.080
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

116
00:07:08.130 --> 00:07:13.130
<v Speaker 2>so by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so we're not allowed to show any </v>

117
00:07:13.130 --> 00:07:15.231
<v Speaker 2>emotion.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

118
00:07:15.330 --> 00:07:18.030
<v Speaker 2>I have a friend of mine who was Russian </v>
<v Speaker 2>who told me,</v>

119
00:07:18.031 --> 00:07:19.980
<v Speaker 2>and she would,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when she moved to this country,</v>

120
00:07:20.140 --> 00:07:21.750
<v Speaker 2>actually,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've had several friends tell me this,</v>

121
00:07:22.410 --> 00:07:26.430
<v Speaker 2>that their cheeks hurt for a year for </v>
<v Speaker 2>how much smiling they had to do.</v>

122
00:07:26.640 --> 00:07:29.400
<v Speaker 2>I've also found from the Netherlands who</v>
<v Speaker 2>moved here who told me the same thing.</v>

123
00:07:29.401 --> 00:07:33.690
<v Speaker 2>Her face ached for how much smiling she </v>
<v Speaker 2>did an in Bulgaria.</v>

124
00:07:33.690 --> 00:07:37.560
<v Speaker 2>They haven't apparently like a a name </v>
<v Speaker 2>for,</v>

125
00:07:37.950 --> 00:07:39.480
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the pervasive,</v>

126
00:07:39.560 --> 00:07:41.700
<v Speaker 2>a American smile,</v>
<v Speaker 2>kind of like a,</v>

127
00:07:42.120 --> 00:07:46.470
<v Speaker 2>not flattering name for how much </v>
<v Speaker 2>American smile,</v>

128
00:07:46.740 --> 00:07:49.650
<v Speaker 2>but basically when you look at someone's</v>
<v Speaker 2>face,</v>

129
00:07:49.680 --> 00:07:54.680
<v Speaker 2>you're making a guess about how they </v>
<v Speaker 2>feel and although you yourself are </v>

130
00:07:54.680 --> 00:07:59.330
<v Speaker 2>focused on their face to you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it feels as if that's where all the </v>

131
00:07:59.330 --> 00:08:02.181
<v Speaker 2>information is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Your brain is actually taking in the </v>

132
00:08:02.181 --> 00:08:03.840
<v Speaker 2>entire sensory ray,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so it's taking in also,</v>

133
00:08:04.010 --> 00:08:09.010
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the sound of the person's voice and the </v>

134
00:08:09.010 --> 00:08:12.200
<v Speaker 2>person's body posture and the dynamic of</v>
<v Speaker 2>temporal changes in all of those signals</v>

135
00:08:13.200 --> 00:08:14.910
<v Speaker 2>to make sense of things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not,</v>

136
00:08:14.911 --> 00:08:18.180
<v Speaker 2>you're not really.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The face is not a lighthouse.</v>

137
00:08:18.270 --> 00:08:22.290
<v Speaker 2>It's not a beacon that just displays </v>
<v Speaker 2>somebody internal state in an obligatory</v>

138
00:08:22.291 --> 00:08:22.650
<v Speaker 2>way.</v>

139
00:08:23.880 --> 00:08:27.750
<v Speaker 1>Nevertheless,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's some signal there of course.</v>

140
00:08:28.170 --> 00:08:33.170
<v Speaker 1>And so what are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what would you say as far as I </v>

141
00:08:33.170 --> 00:08:34.800
<v Speaker 1>understand there's no good answer yet </v>
<v Speaker 1>from sciences.</v>

142
00:08:34.801 --> 00:08:38.010
<v Speaker 1>What are the basic building blocks of </v>
<v Speaker 1>emotion?</v>

143
00:08:39.110 --> 00:08:41.700
<v Speaker 2>I wouldn't say that there's no good </v>
<v Speaker 2>answer from science.</v>

144
00:08:41.701 --> 00:08:46.701
<v Speaker 2>I would say scientists disagree.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it's very clear what the </v>

145
00:08:46.701 --> 00:08:46.970
<v Speaker 2>building blocks are.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

146
00:08:47.460 --> 00:08:48.180
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

147
00:08:49.530 --> 00:08:54.530
<v Speaker 2>in one way or another,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you look back all the way to ancient </v>

148
00:08:54.530 --> 00:08:55.050
<v Speaker 2>Greece,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can,</v>

149
00:08:55.290 --> 00:09:00.290
<v Speaker 2>that there are two kinds of views of </v>
<v Speaker 2>emotion that had been battling it out </v>

150
00:09:00.840 --> 00:09:05.840
<v Speaker 2>for millennia.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One is the idea that you have,</v>

151
00:09:06.810 --> 00:09:07.380
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all,</v>

152
00:09:07.390 --> 00:09:09.540
<v Speaker 2>I will give you the modern versions of </v>
<v Speaker 2>these views,</v>

153
00:09:09.541 --> 00:09:11.550
<v Speaker 2>but they really do have a very long </v>
<v Speaker 2>history.</v>

154
00:09:11.790 --> 00:09:16.790
<v Speaker 2>One is the idea that you are born with </v>
<v Speaker 2>circuits in your brain that are pre </v>

155
00:09:18.530 --> 00:09:23.530
<v Speaker 2>prewired for emotion so that everybody </v>
<v Speaker 2>around the world is born with an anger </v>

156
00:09:23.530 --> 00:09:24.210
<v Speaker 2>circuit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a fear circuit,</v>

157
00:09:24.290 --> 00:09:26.580
<v Speaker 2>sadness circuit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a happiness circuit,</v>

158
00:09:26.581 --> 00:09:29.880
<v Speaker 2>some other circuits to you have them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We all have them.</v>

159
00:09:29.940 --> 00:09:34.170
<v Speaker 2>All neurotypical brains have them and </v>
<v Speaker 2>actually other animals have them too.</v>

160
00:09:35.400 --> 00:09:39.660
<v Speaker 2>And the idea is that when you know one </v>
<v Speaker 2>of these circuses triggered,</v>

161
00:09:39.900 --> 00:09:42.690
<v Speaker 2>you have an emotional response,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is obligatory.</v>

162
00:09:43.320 --> 00:09:47.100
<v Speaker 2>So you have a very stereotypic change in</v>
<v Speaker 2>your body.</v>

163
00:09:47.101 --> 00:09:49.260
<v Speaker 2>Your breathing changes in a stereotypic </v>
<v Speaker 2>way.</v>

164
00:09:49.261 --> 00:09:50.450
<v Speaker 2>You're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

165
00:09:50.490 --> 00:09:52.260
<v Speaker 2>heart rate changes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your,</v>

166
00:09:53.050 --> 00:09:56.270
<v Speaker 2>the chemicals in your body change in a </v>
<v Speaker 2>particular way.</v>

167
00:09:56.300 --> 00:09:59.070
<v Speaker 2>You make a particular facial expression </v>
<v Speaker 2>and you are,</v>

168
00:09:59.071 --> 00:10:03.330
<v Speaker 2>I'm a have a propensity to make a </v>
<v Speaker 2>particular action like you,</v>

169
00:10:03.540 --> 00:10:07.500
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>attack and anger and you run in fear are</v>

170
00:10:07.501 --> 00:10:09.850
<v Speaker 2>you freezing here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

171
00:10:10.310 --> 00:10:12.410
<v Speaker 2>and then there's another view which </v>
<v Speaker 2>says,</v>

172
00:10:13.670 --> 00:10:16.940
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there are some basic kind of ingredients</v>

173
00:10:16.941 --> 00:10:20.150
<v Speaker 2>or building blocks that the human mind </v>
<v Speaker 2>or the human brain.</v>

174
00:10:20.151 --> 00:10:21.580
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

175
00:10:21.810 --> 00:10:26.810
<v Speaker 2>people talk about the brain.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now there are some basic ingredients </v>

176
00:10:26.810 --> 00:10:30.191
<v Speaker 2>that your brain uses a and it uses them </v>
<v Speaker 2>to make every kind of mental event that </v>

177
00:10:30.191 --> 00:10:31.790
<v Speaker 2>you experienced.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And every action that you take,</v>

178
00:10:31.970 --> 00:10:34.700
<v Speaker 2>the recipes are what are unique.</v>

179
00:10:34.700 --> 00:10:36.890
<v Speaker 2>The ingredients are common,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

180
00:10:36.891 --> 00:10:41.891
<v Speaker 2>Just like you can take flour and water </v>
<v Speaker 2>and salt and you can make a whole bunch </v>

181
00:10:41.891 --> 00:10:45.131
<v Speaker 2>of different recipes with them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>some of which aren't even food like </v>

182
00:10:45.131 --> 00:10:46.490
<v Speaker 2>glue.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm in a similar way.</v>

183
00:10:46.491 --> 00:10:51.491
<v Speaker 2>The idea is that your brain has some </v>
<v Speaker 2>kind of all purpose capacities and it </v>

184
00:10:51.491 --> 00:10:55.631
<v Speaker 2>can,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it puts these ingredients together and </v>

185
00:10:55.631 --> 00:10:57.170
<v Speaker 2>it makes a motion as you need them on </v>
<v Speaker 2>the spot and you don't have one anger.</v>

186
00:10:57.171 --> 00:11:00.880
<v Speaker 2>You have a whole repertoire of anger.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You don't have one sadness.</v>

187
00:11:00.910 --> 00:11:04.340
<v Speaker 2>You have a whole repertoire of sadness </v>
<v Speaker 2>and if you grow up in a culture that has</v>

188
00:11:04.341 --> 00:11:09.341
<v Speaker 2>no concept for sadness,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you don't experience sadness and you </v>

189
00:11:09.341 --> 00:11:12.701
<v Speaker 2>don't perceive sadness because your </v>
<v Speaker 2>brain becomes wired to make whatever </v>

190
00:11:12.771 --> 00:11:17.690
<v Speaker 2>mental events that are exist in your </v>
<v Speaker 2>particular culture.</v>

191
00:11:18.670 --> 00:11:23.670
<v Speaker 1>So for artificial intelligence systems,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the idea of emotional intelligence is </v>

192
00:11:24.561 --> 00:11:28.280
<v Speaker 1>really difficult and it seems like it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>an important thing to try to instill.</v>

193
00:11:28.580 --> 00:11:33.580
<v Speaker 1>So for human beings,</v>
<v Speaker 1>where do you see the importance on the </v>

194
00:11:33.580 --> 00:11:36.670
<v Speaker 1>priority list of what makes us human?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Where does emotion sit?</v>

195
00:11:38.040 --> 00:11:42.990
<v Speaker 2>I think that's the wrong question to ask</v>
<v Speaker 2>because I'm.</v>

196
00:11:43.900 --> 00:11:45.000
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean I think.</v>

197
00:11:45.030 --> 00:11:47.190
<v Speaker 2>I think people constantly ask that </v>
<v Speaker 2>question,</v>

198
00:11:47.191 --> 00:11:49.620
<v Speaker 2>but I don't think it's the right </v>
<v Speaker 2>question to ask because you know,</v>

199
00:11:49.621 --> 00:11:54.621
<v Speaker 2>some cultures in our,</v>
<v Speaker 2>on our planet don't have a concept for </v>

200
00:11:54.911 --> 00:11:59.911
<v Speaker 2>emotion and people don't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>While they experience what I'm going to </v>

201
00:12:00.220 --> 00:12:03.730
<v Speaker 2>refer to as a in scientific terms we </v>
<v Speaker 2>call an effect,</v>

202
00:12:03.731 --> 00:12:08.731
<v Speaker 2>which is our simple feelings of feeling </v>
<v Speaker 2>pleasant or unpleasant or feeling worked</v>

203
00:12:08.801 --> 00:12:11.100
<v Speaker 2>up or calm or comfortable or disc or you</v>
<v Speaker 2>know,</v>

204
00:12:11.110 --> 00:12:16.110
<v Speaker 2>having discomfort.</v>
<v Speaker 2>These are feelings that come directly </v>

205
00:12:16.110 --> 00:12:19.141
<v Speaker 2>from the internal state of the physical </v>
<v Speaker 2>systems in your body.</v>

206
00:12:20.020 --> 00:12:22.900
<v Speaker 2>Not everybody makes emotions out of </v>
<v Speaker 2>those feelings,</v>

207
00:12:22.960 --> 00:12:27.960
<v Speaker 2>and in fact,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we often don't make emotions out of </v>

208
00:12:27.960 --> 00:12:27.960
<v Speaker 2>those foods.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So let's feelings.</v>

209
00:12:27.960 --> 00:12:31.390
<v Speaker 2>The way to think about it is that your </v>
<v Speaker 2>brain comes wired to regulate your body.</v>

210
00:12:31.570 --> 00:12:36.570
<v Speaker 2>Actually sort of take that back you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Your brain becomes wired when you're </v>

211
00:12:36.570 --> 00:12:41.161
<v Speaker 2>born,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your brain becomes wired with the </v>

212
00:12:41.161 --> 00:12:42.361
<v Speaker 2>potential to regulate your body.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Infants actually don't regulate their </v>

213
00:12:42.361 --> 00:12:44.770
<v Speaker 2>own nervous systems very well.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They can't put themselves to sleep.</v>

214
00:12:45.100 --> 00:12:50.100
<v Speaker 2>They can't calm themselves down.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They can't regulate their own </v>

215
00:12:50.100 --> 00:12:52.330
<v Speaker 2>temperature.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's what they need caregivers for.</v>

216
00:12:52.540 --> 00:12:57.540
<v Speaker 2>And as caregivers regulate the nervous </v>
<v Speaker 2>systems of their infants that wires the </v>

217
00:12:57.540 --> 00:12:58.960
<v Speaker 2>infant's brain,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

218
00:12:58.961 --> 00:13:01.350
<v Speaker 2>So infant little infant brains aren't </v>
<v Speaker 2>born,</v>

219
00:13:01.740 --> 00:13:04.120
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like little miniature adult brains.</v>

220
00:13:04.150 --> 00:13:09.150
<v Speaker 2>They're born at waiting for a set of </v>
<v Speaker 2>wiring instructions from the world and </v>

221
00:13:09.371 --> 00:13:14.200
<v Speaker 2>they wire themselves to the physical and</v>
<v Speaker 2>social realities that they grow in.</v>

222
00:13:15.040 --> 00:13:18.640
<v Speaker 2>And as they learn to do this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>

223
00:13:18.950 --> 00:13:20.740
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>experience,</v>

224
00:13:21.040 --> 00:13:24.020
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>these simple feelings that you know,</v>

225
00:13:24.021 --> 00:13:25.810
<v Speaker 2>of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>feeling pleasant or unpleasant,</v>

226
00:13:25.811 --> 00:13:30.811
<v Speaker 2>feeling worked up or feeling calm.</v>
<v Speaker 2>These are kind of like barometer </v>

227
00:13:30.811 --> 00:13:30.811
<v Speaker 2>readings in a way.</v>

228
00:13:30.811 --> 00:13:34.840
<v Speaker 2>They're very simple and they lack a lot </v>
<v Speaker 2>of detail because of how we're wired,</v>

229
00:13:35.410 --> 00:13:37.480
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and we have to make sense of them.</v>

230
00:13:37.870 --> 00:13:41.020
<v Speaker 2>And the way the culture makes sense of </v>
<v Speaker 2>them is not always about emotion.</v>

231
00:13:41.021 --> 00:13:42.610
<v Speaker 2>So I would say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

232
00:13:42.940 --> 00:13:45.670
<v Speaker 2>in our culture,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when we lose something significant,</v>

233
00:13:45.671 --> 00:13:50.671
<v Speaker 2>like a loved one,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we feel sad into he into Haitian people </v>

234
00:13:50.861 --> 00:13:53.920
<v Speaker 2>feel sick.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They have an illness.</v>

235
00:13:54.040 --> 00:13:59.040
<v Speaker 2>It's not sadness.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A hundred or 200 years ago there was an </v>

236
00:13:59.040 --> 00:14:03.811
<v Speaker 2>emotion called nostalgia,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which killed people was thought to kill </v>

237
00:14:04.031 --> 00:14:05.240
<v Speaker 2>people after,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

238
00:14:05.260 --> 00:14:07.540
<v Speaker 2>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>after serving in world war one,</v>

239
00:14:07.750 --> 00:14:11.410
<v Speaker 2>we would now call that depression.</v>

240
00:14:14.050 --> 00:14:19.050
<v Speaker 2>It's not just a matter of changing the </v>
<v Speaker 2>label of something and it's actually the</v>

241
00:14:20.350 --> 00:14:22.510
<v Speaker 2>formation of the experience is very </v>
<v Speaker 2>different.</v>

242
00:14:22.511 --> 00:14:25.570
<v Speaker 2>So if you want to build an intelligent </v>
<v Speaker 2>agent,</v>

243
00:14:25.870 --> 00:14:29.380
<v Speaker 2>I don't think emotion is what you need </v>
<v Speaker 2>to endow it with.</v>

244
00:14:29.381 --> 00:14:34.381
<v Speaker 2>You need to endow it with these basic </v>
<v Speaker 2>ingredients that it can use to make </v>

245
00:14:34.381 --> 00:14:38.800
<v Speaker 2>whatever experiences or guide whatever </v>
<v Speaker 2>actions,</v>

246
00:14:38.860 --> 00:14:43.860
<v Speaker 2>make whatever states or guide whatever </v>
<v Speaker 2>actions are relevant to the situations </v>

247
00:14:43.860 --> 00:14:48.301
<v Speaker 2>that it's in.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That will be different if it's an </v>

248
00:14:48.301 --> 00:14:50.791
<v Speaker 2>American or a British or a western </v>
<v Speaker 2>urbanized environment than say if you </v>

249
00:14:52.371 --> 00:14:56.240
<v Speaker 2>were to go to Tanzania and steady,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

250
00:14:56.241 --> 00:15:00.170
<v Speaker 2>the Hadza who were hunting and gathering</v>
<v Speaker 2>since that culture,</v>

251
00:15:00.171 --> 00:15:05.171
<v Speaker 2>since the pleistocene words or human </v>
<v Speaker 2>interpretable labels on these basic </v>

252
00:15:07.581 --> 00:15:10.250
<v Speaker 2>ingredients that we can understand.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think so.</v>

253
00:15:10.460 --> 00:15:12.680
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think the first thing to understand is</v>

254
00:15:12.681 --> 00:15:17.681
<v Speaker 2>that when we think about building an </v>
<v Speaker 2>intelligent agent,</v>

255
00:15:17.931 --> 00:15:22.931
<v Speaker 2>we think about endowing the agent with </v>
<v Speaker 2>cognition or with emotion or the ability</v>

256
00:15:24.801 --> 00:15:25.170
<v Speaker 2>to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to,</v>

257
00:15:25.310 --> 00:15:30.310
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to perceive things in the world because </v>

258
00:15:30.310 --> 00:15:34.150
<v Speaker 2>as humans that those are.</v>
<v Speaker 2>These are the things that are really </v>

259
00:15:34.150 --> 00:15:34.250
<v Speaker 2>important to us,</v>
<v Speaker 2>especially in our culture,</v>

260
00:15:34.310 --> 00:15:35.420
<v Speaker 2>thinking,</v>
<v Speaker 2>feeling,</v>

261
00:15:35.421 --> 00:15:37.550
<v Speaker 2>seeing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and other cultures.</v>

262
00:15:38.320 --> 00:15:43.320
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they have different ways of parsing </v>

263
00:15:43.320 --> 00:15:43.640
<v Speaker 2>things,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the truth is that your brain did not</v>

264
00:15:43.641 --> 00:15:48.641
<v Speaker 2>evolve so that you could think and feel </v>
<v Speaker 2>and see.</v>

265
00:15:51.530 --> 00:15:55.190
<v Speaker 2>It evolved.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Brains evolved to control bodies.</v>

266
00:15:57.200 --> 00:16:02.200
<v Speaker 2>Brains evolved so that they could </v>
<v Speaker 2>control the various systems of the body </v>

267
00:16:04.280 --> 00:16:09.280
<v Speaker 2>as creatures move around in order to </v>
<v Speaker 2>gain resources like food and water and a</v>

268
00:16:13.791 --> 00:16:18.791
<v Speaker 2>brain has to figure out how much </v>
<v Speaker 2>resources to expand on getting </v>

269
00:16:19.761 --> 00:16:23.090
<v Speaker 2>additional resources.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now that may sound really trivial,</v>

270
00:16:23.091 --> 00:16:28.091
<v Speaker 2>but it turns out it's actually really </v>
<v Speaker 2>hard and scientists actually haven't </v>

271
00:16:28.091 --> 00:16:30.290
<v Speaker 2>really figured out completely how brains</v>
<v Speaker 2>do this.</v>

272
00:16:31.700 --> 00:16:36.700
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what's really interesting to me is that </v>

273
00:16:36.700 --> 00:16:36.700
<v Speaker 2>if you look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for example,</v>

274
00:16:36.700 --> 00:16:37.010
<v Speaker 2>at computer vision,</v>
<v Speaker 2>try to figure out,</v>

275
00:16:37.011 --> 00:16:38.270
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how an,</v>

276
00:16:38.360 --> 00:16:40.280
<v Speaker 2>how to make,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

277
00:16:40.281 --> 00:16:43.370
<v Speaker 2>an agent.</v>
<v Speaker 2>See that's a pretty much solved problem.</v>

278
00:16:43.400 --> 00:16:46.940
<v Speaker 2>Not Completely.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a pretty much solved problem in the</v>

279
00:16:46.941 --> 00:16:48.930
<v Speaker 2>basics are solved your perception </v>
<v Speaker 2>problem.</v>

280
00:16:49.030 --> 00:16:50.540
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the pure perception problem.</v>

281
00:16:50.600 --> 00:16:54.710
<v Speaker 2>However,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you want to create an agent that just</v>

282
00:16:54.740 --> 00:16:58.070
<v Speaker 2>reaches out smoothly,</v>
<v Speaker 2>grabs a glass,</v>

283
00:16:58.280 --> 00:17:03.280
<v Speaker 2>and brings it into the body to drink </v>
<v Speaker 2>that problem is not solved something as </v>

284
00:17:03.981 --> 00:17:08.981
<v Speaker 2>simple as movement,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which we think of as this really basic </v>

285
00:17:08.981 --> 00:17:08.981
<v Speaker 2>thing like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

286
00:17:08.981 --> 00:17:08.981
<v Speaker 2>it's so trivial.</v>

287
00:17:08.981 --> 00:17:13.360
<v Speaker 2>All animals can do it is actually the </v>
<v Speaker 2>harder one of the hardest problems to </v>

288
00:17:13.360 --> 00:17:17.150
<v Speaker 2>solve.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And brains basically.</v>

289
00:17:17.480 --> 00:17:22.480
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a whole story here about </v>

290
00:17:22.480 --> 00:17:24.491
<v Speaker 2>evolution,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which has nothing to do with having a </v>

291
00:17:24.491 --> 00:17:24.491
<v Speaker 2>lizard brain which is wrapped in a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

292
00:17:24.491 --> 00:17:27.100
<v Speaker 2>a cognitive brain or anything like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

293
00:17:27.910 --> 00:17:29.900
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's a reference to the triune brain,</v>

294
00:17:29.901 --> 00:17:34.901
<v Speaker 2>which a lot of people believe it's a way</v>
<v Speaker 2>of thinking about brain evolution </v>

295
00:17:34.901 --> 00:17:35.230
<v Speaker 2>instead.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

296
00:17:35.240 --> 00:17:40.240
<v Speaker 2>what we,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what seems to be the case is that as </v>

297
00:17:40.240 --> 00:17:40.240
<v Speaker 2>bodies got larger,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

298
00:17:40.240 --> 00:17:44.750
<v Speaker 2>and there were more systems because the </v>
<v Speaker 2>niche of the animal,</v>

299
00:17:44.751 --> 00:17:49.751
<v Speaker 2>the environment,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the animal got bigger and bigger and </v>

300
00:17:49.751 --> 00:17:49.751
<v Speaker 2>bigger.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Brains also had to get bigger,</v>

301
00:17:49.751 --> 00:17:53.580
<v Speaker 2>but they had to get bigger to a point </v>
<v Speaker 2>with some constraints.</v>

302
00:17:53.850 --> 00:17:56.460
<v Speaker 2>Like they have to be.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You have to keep,</v>

303
00:17:56.650 --> 00:18:00.180
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>metabolic cost down.</v>

304
00:18:00.181 --> 00:18:02.220
<v Speaker 2>It's really important.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you don't,</v>

305
00:18:02.280 --> 00:18:04.410
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>creatures get sick and die.</v>

306
00:18:04.800 --> 00:18:09.800
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we can talk about what that means in </v>

307
00:18:09.800 --> 00:18:09.800
<v Speaker 2>terms of depression or metabolic </v>
<v Speaker 2>illnesses or what have you.</v>

308
00:18:09.800 --> 00:18:11.310
<v Speaker 2>But so what are the basic ingredients?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

309
00:18:11.311 --> 00:18:16.311
<v Speaker 2>one of the basic ingredients is that </v>
<v Speaker 2>your brain is controlling your body all </v>

310
00:18:16.311 --> 00:18:17.010
<v Speaker 2>the time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Whether you feel it or not,</v>

311
00:18:17.011 --> 00:18:20.280
<v Speaker 2>whether you're thinking about it or not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whether you're asleep or awake,</v>

312
00:18:20.670 --> 00:18:25.170
<v Speaker 2>certain parts of your brain are always </v>
<v Speaker 2>very active all the time,</v>

313
00:18:25.440 --> 00:18:28.140
<v Speaker 2>even when you're sleeping or else you'd </v>
<v Speaker 2>be dead,</v>

314
00:18:29.160 --> 00:18:34.160
<v Speaker 2>and those parts of the brain that are </v>
<v Speaker 2>controlling your heart and your lungs </v>

315
00:18:34.160 --> 00:18:38.670
<v Speaker 2>and your immune system and all of those </v>
<v Speaker 2>regions that are controlling the systems</v>

316
00:18:38.671 --> 00:18:43.671
<v Speaker 2>of your body are also helping your brain</v>
<v Speaker 2>to represent the sensory consequences of</v>

317
00:18:46.170 --> 00:18:49.920
<v Speaker 2>those changes in your body,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which you don't feel directly.</v>

318
00:18:50.820 --> 00:18:53.730
<v Speaker 2>You don't feel your heart beating most </v>
<v Speaker 2>of the time.</v>

319
00:18:53.940 --> 00:18:58.940
<v Speaker 2>You don't feel your lungs expanding most</v>
<v Speaker 2>of the time and there's a really good </v>

320
00:18:58.951 --> 00:19:03.210
<v Speaker 2>reason why we are all wired not to feel </v>
<v Speaker 2>those things,</v>

321
00:19:03.360 --> 00:19:08.360
<v Speaker 2>and that is you'd never pay attention to</v>
<v Speaker 2>anything outside in the world ever </v>

322
00:19:08.360 --> 00:19:11.541
<v Speaker 2>again.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you could feel every little movement </v>

323
00:19:11.541 --> 00:19:14.181
<v Speaker 2>that was going on inside your body,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so your brain represents those as a </v>

324
00:19:14.181 --> 00:19:15.420
<v Speaker 2>summary.</v>
<v Speaker 2>These kinds of simple summary feelings.</v>

325
00:19:15.421 --> 00:19:17.190
<v Speaker 2>You feel good,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you feel bad,</v>

326
00:19:17.250 --> 00:19:19.110
<v Speaker 2>you feel great.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You feel like shit.</v>

327
00:19:19.380 --> 00:19:21.870
<v Speaker 2>You feel really jittery.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You feel really calm,</v>

328
00:19:22.470 --> 00:19:26.220
<v Speaker 2>and these feelings are not emotions.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They sometimes keep your brain,</v>

329
00:19:26.221 --> 00:19:30.120
<v Speaker 2>can make them into emotions,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they're with you every waking moment</v>

330
00:19:30.121 --> 00:19:30.900
<v Speaker 2>of your life.</v>

331
00:19:32.950 --> 00:19:37.950
<v Speaker 2>There are properties of consciousness in</v>
<v Speaker 2>the way that lightness and darkness is a</v>

332
00:19:38.881 --> 00:19:43.881
<v Speaker 2>property of vision,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and sometimes we make them into emotions</v>

333
00:19:44.551 --> 00:19:49.551
<v Speaker 2>when they're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when we have a big change in our heart </v>

334
00:19:49.551 --> 00:19:49.590
<v Speaker 2>rate or a big change in our,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

335
00:19:49.710 --> 00:19:54.710
<v Speaker 2>in our breathing rate or a big change in</v>
<v Speaker 2>our temperature or a big surge of </v>

336
00:19:54.710 --> 00:19:55.990
<v Speaker 2>glucose,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

337
00:19:56.070 --> 00:20:01.070
<v Speaker 2>we,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my brain might make a emotion out of </v>

338
00:20:01.070 --> 00:20:03.240
<v Speaker 2>those changes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>those very strong changes which you will</v>

339
00:20:03.241 --> 00:20:06.780
<v Speaker 2>feel as really feeling unpleasant or </v>
<v Speaker 2>really feeling pleasant,</v>

340
00:20:07.230 --> 00:20:11.550
<v Speaker 2>but your brain might also make hunger or</v>
<v Speaker 2>your brain might make an instance of,</v>

341
00:20:11.800 --> 00:20:14.090
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

342
00:20:14.360 --> 00:20:19.360
<v Speaker 2>a physical sensation like nausea or your</v>
<v Speaker 2>brain might even make a perception of </v>

343
00:20:20.461 --> 00:20:21.750
<v Speaker 2>the world.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

344
00:20:22.140 --> 00:20:25.530
<v Speaker 2>that's a nice guy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That guy's an asshole.</v>

345
00:20:25.920 --> 00:20:29.730
<v Speaker 2>This is a really delicious drink.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a beautiful painting.</v>

346
00:20:30.000 --> 00:20:33.120
<v Speaker 2>Those are also moments where these </v>
<v Speaker 2>simple feelings,</v>

347
00:20:33.121 --> 00:20:37.980
<v Speaker 2>which we call an effect are very strong.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So aspect is a basic ingredient.</v>

348
00:20:39.750 --> 00:20:41.550
<v Speaker 2>There are others that I could talk about</v>
<v Speaker 2>too.</v>

349
00:20:41.551 --> 00:20:44.280
<v Speaker 2>It's not the only one,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but one of the things I think that,</v>

350
00:20:44.281 --> 00:20:49.281
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that sometimes people who are to build </v>

351
00:20:49.281 --> 00:20:53.640
<v Speaker 2>ai systems don't realize is that the </v>
<v Speaker 2>brain,</v>

352
00:20:54.640 --> 00:20:59.640
<v Speaker 2>its fundamental job is to keep your body</v>
<v Speaker 2>alive and well.</v>

353
00:21:00.890 --> 00:21:05.890
<v Speaker 2>And if you don't have some kind of body </v>
<v Speaker 2>to regulate with effective feelings that</v>

354
00:21:08.271 --> 00:21:10.160
<v Speaker 2>come from that regulation</v>

355
00:21:12.230 --> 00:21:17.230
<v Speaker 2>or something like that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's you're kind of going to be out of </v>

356
00:21:17.481 --> 00:21:22.481
<v Speaker 2>luck.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think in rendering something that </v>

357
00:21:22.481 --> 00:21:23.330
<v Speaker 2>looks more something that seems more </v>
<v Speaker 2>human,</v>

358
00:21:24.070 --> 00:21:27.350
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So maybe you can elaborate a like in the</v>

359
00:21:27.351 --> 00:21:32.351
<v Speaker 1>book sapiens that we as human beings are</v>
<v Speaker 1>really good en masse as a,</v>

360
00:21:33.130 --> 00:21:38.130
<v Speaker 1>with thousands,</v>
<v Speaker 1>millions of people together believing </v>

361
00:21:38.130 --> 00:21:38.130
<v Speaker 1>something,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even if it's not true.</v>

362
00:21:38.130 --> 00:21:42.550
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so while scientifically sort of from a </v>

363
00:21:42.661 --> 00:21:46.290
<v Speaker 1>neuroscience perspective is maybe very </v>
<v Speaker 1>true that emotions aren't real.</v>

364
00:21:48.080 --> 00:21:50.850
<v Speaker 2>But I said they're not there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There isn't.</v>

365
00:21:50.851 --> 00:21:52.750
<v Speaker 2>So it interesting are you finished?</v>

366
00:21:53.390 --> 00:21:58.390
<v Speaker 1>So what I'm trying to say is also from a</v>
<v Speaker 1>perspective is they become these trivial</v>

367
00:22:00.980 --> 00:22:05.980
<v Speaker 1>ideas of mapping a smile to being happy </v>
<v Speaker 1>and these kinds of trivial ideas become </v>

368
00:22:05.980 --> 00:22:10.481
<v Speaker 1>real to us through Hollywood,</v>
<v Speaker 1>through cultural spreading that </v>

369
00:22:10.481 --> 00:22:14.591
<v Speaker 1>information.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And we start to believe this and </v>

370
00:22:14.591 --> 00:22:15.120
<v Speaker 1>therefore it becomes real innocent in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in,</v>

371
00:22:15.570 --> 00:22:20.330
<v Speaker 1>in as much as anything is real about our</v>
<v Speaker 1>called our perception together.</v>

372
00:22:20.510 --> 00:22:24.980
<v Speaker 1>So it's really important scientifically </v>
<v Speaker 1>the ideas that you're presenting.</v>

373
00:22:25.010 --> 00:22:30.010
<v Speaker 1>But does that mean there's just because </v>
<v Speaker 1>our brain doesn't feel those explicit </v>

374
00:22:30.010 --> 00:22:31.670
<v Speaker 1>emotions,</v>
<v Speaker 1>does that mean they're not real?</v>

375
00:22:31.920 --> 00:22:33.990
<v Speaker 2>I didn't say we don't feel explicit </v>
<v Speaker 2>emotions.</v>

376
00:22:34.290 --> 00:22:38.250
<v Speaker 2>So I want to be really clear about this </v>
<v Speaker 2>because it's an interesting this,</v>

377
00:22:38.410 --> 00:22:38.950
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this,</v>

378
00:22:38.960 --> 00:22:40.950
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this</v>

379
00:22:41.880 --> 00:22:46.880
<v Speaker 2>in France,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's an interesting inference that </v>

380
00:22:46.880 --> 00:22:46.880
<v Speaker 2>people often make.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so,</v>

381
00:22:46.880 --> 00:22:51.580
<v Speaker 2>but it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a mistake and it's a mistake that </v>

382
00:22:51.580 --> 00:22:53.660
<v Speaker 2>betrays a certain kind of thinking that </v>
<v Speaker 2>we do in this culture.</v>

383
00:22:54.350 --> 00:22:56.540
<v Speaker 2>And it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's the mistake of the following sort.</v>

384
00:22:56.541 --> 00:23:01.541
<v Speaker 2>So when I say there is no facial </v>
<v Speaker 2>expression that is diagnostic of a </v>

385
00:23:02.271 --> 00:23:07.271
<v Speaker 2>single emotion,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that doesn't mean that people don't </v>

386
00:23:07.271 --> 00:23:10.010
<v Speaker 2>express emotion.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They certainly do express emotion.</v>

387
00:23:10.011 --> 00:23:11.600
<v Speaker 2>They just don't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

388
00:23:11.601 --> 00:23:13.580
<v Speaker 2>when,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when they're in a state of anger,</v>

389
00:23:13.581 --> 00:23:17.480
<v Speaker 2>in a state of sadness or an estate of </v>
<v Speaker 2>all their faces don't do one thing.</v>

390
00:23:17.750 --> 00:23:19.250
<v Speaker 2>When I say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

391
00:23:19.251 --> 00:23:23.730
<v Speaker 2>your body can do many things when you're</v>
<v Speaker 2>angry or when you're sad or,</v>

392
00:23:23.760 --> 00:23:26.010
<v Speaker 2>but let's take anger.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Your heart rate can go up,</v>

393
00:23:26.040 --> 00:23:28.020
<v Speaker 2>it can go down,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it can stay the same.</v>

394
00:23:28.080 --> 00:23:30.330
<v Speaker 2>Your breathing rate can go up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it can go down,</v>

395
00:23:30.360 --> 00:23:31.350
<v Speaker 2>it can stay the same.</v>

396
00:23:31.930 --> 00:23:36.930
<v Speaker 2>The same pattern that you see in anger </v>
<v Speaker 2>you sometimes see in sadness and you </v>

397
00:23:36.930 --> 00:23:41.251
<v Speaker 2>sometimes see in fear.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You sometimes even see it in enthusiasm </v>

398
00:23:41.251 --> 00:23:41.251
<v Speaker 2>and in.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All right,</v>

399
00:23:41.251 --> 00:23:43.430
<v Speaker 2>so does that mean that emotions aren't </v>
<v Speaker 2>real?</v>

400
00:23:43.490 --> 00:23:44.930
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Emotions are real,</v>

401
00:23:45.380 --> 00:23:50.380
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but sometimes things are real because </v>

402
00:23:50.450 --> 00:23:55.450
<v Speaker 2>the physical meaning of the signal is </v>
<v Speaker 2>endowed in the signal.</v>

403
00:23:57.010 --> 00:24:01.790
<v Speaker 2>Okay?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So when your retina communicates to your</v>

404
00:24:01.791 --> 00:24:06.791
<v Speaker 2>brain that you have,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that you are faced with a wavelength of </v>

405
00:24:06.791 --> 00:24:06.791
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

406
00:24:06.791 --> 00:24:09.590
<v Speaker 2>is 600,</v>
<v Speaker 2>600 nanometers.</v>

407
00:24:11.060 --> 00:24:14.780
<v Speaker 2>The signal is endowed in your brain.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's like in the signal.</v>

408
00:24:14.781 --> 00:24:18.380
<v Speaker 2>It's not like interpreted on interpret </v>
<v Speaker 2>that it's 600 nanometers.</v>

409
00:24:18.381 --> 00:24:21.530
<v Speaker 2>It is 600 nanometers.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The information's in the signal,</v>

410
00:24:22.670 --> 00:24:27.670
<v Speaker 2>but when you see read,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that information is not in the signal.</v>

411
00:24:29.990 --> 00:24:34.580
<v Speaker 2>Your brain has added information that </v>
<v Speaker 2>isn't in the signal itself.</v>

412
00:24:34.610 --> 00:24:39.610
<v Speaker 2>In a sense,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your brain has imposed meaning on a </v>

413
00:24:39.610 --> 00:24:42.710
<v Speaker 2>signal that the signal doesn't have on </v>
<v Speaker 2>its own.</v>

414
00:24:43.340 --> 00:24:48.340
<v Speaker 2>The let me back up and give a different </v>
<v Speaker 2>example to make it a little easier and </v>

415
00:24:48.340 --> 00:24:50.060
<v Speaker 2>then will reapproach this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's is a,</v>

416
00:24:50.840 --> 00:24:53.900
<v Speaker 2>there are some things that we impose.</v>
<v Speaker 2>In fact,</v>

417
00:24:54.140 --> 00:24:57.020
<v Speaker 2>this is true almost all civilization,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

418
00:24:57.290 --> 00:25:02.290
<v Speaker 2>That we,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there are some things that are real by </v>

419
00:25:02.290 --> 00:25:02.570
<v Speaker 2>virtue of the fact that we agree that </v>
<v Speaker 2>they exist.</v>

420
00:25:03.950 --> 00:25:08.930
<v Speaker 2>Little pieces of paper serve as money or</v>
<v Speaker 2>now,</v>

421
00:25:08.980 --> 00:25:13.980
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>bit coin or little pieces of plastic or </v>

422
00:25:13.980 --> 00:25:17.711
<v Speaker 2>gold or diamonds,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or in the past barley,</v>

423
00:25:17.780 --> 00:25:22.780
<v Speaker 2>salt shells,</v>
<v Speaker 2>rocks serve as currency,</v>

424
00:25:23.330 --> 00:25:27.440
<v Speaker 2>have value only because a group of </v>
<v Speaker 2>people agree that they have value.</v>

425
00:25:28.310 --> 00:25:33.310
<v Speaker 2>So we impose meaning on objects.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And once we all agree that that object </v>

426
00:25:36.440 --> 00:25:39.230
<v Speaker 2>actually has value,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we can trade it for material goods.</v>

427
00:25:39.470 --> 00:25:43.040
<v Speaker 2>The minute that some of us disagree,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

428
00:25:43.110 --> 00:25:43.770
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we,</v>

429
00:25:44.010 --> 00:25:47.510
<v Speaker 2>we withdraw our consent,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

430
00:25:48.790 --> 00:25:53.790
<v Speaker 2>The things lose their value.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's what happened in the mortgage </v>

431
00:25:53.790 --> 00:25:53.790
<v Speaker 2>crisis.</v>

432
00:25:53.790 --> 00:25:56.090
<v Speaker 2>That's what happened in the tulip.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Crisis in the,</v>

433
00:25:56.100 --> 00:25:58.160
<v Speaker 2>in the Netherlands.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

434
00:25:58.280 --> 00:26:03.280
<v Speaker 2>in the 17th century or 16th century </v>
<v Speaker 2>Renner was money.</v>

435
00:26:04.310 --> 00:26:09.310
<v Speaker 2>Currency exists because we impose </v>
<v Speaker 2>meaning on objects in the world,</v>

436
00:26:10.970 --> 00:26:15.970
<v Speaker 2>physical objects in the world that </v>
<v Speaker 2>themselves don't have that meeting on </v>

437
00:26:15.970 --> 00:26:18.770
<v Speaker 2>their own and they are very real money </v>
<v Speaker 2>is very real to people.</v>

438
00:26:18.771 --> 00:26:23.771
<v Speaker 2>I can stick somebody's head in a brain </v>
<v Speaker 2>scanner and show you that they </v>

439
00:26:23.771 --> 00:26:26.270
<v Speaker 2>experienced value in a very real way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that,</v>

440
00:26:26.370 --> 00:26:31.370
<v Speaker 2>that reality is constructed by,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

441
00:26:32.120 --> 00:26:36.230
<v Speaker 2>the fact that they have learned the </v>
<v Speaker 2>value in a particular culture.</v>

442
00:26:36.440 --> 00:26:38.570
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's also what we do with emotion.</v>

443
00:26:38.630 --> 00:26:43.630
<v Speaker 2>We impose meaning on certain physical </v>
<v Speaker 2>signals that they don't have by</v>

444
00:26:44.020 --> 00:26:47.110
<v Speaker 1>on their own and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but we have collective intentionality.</v>

445
00:26:47.111 --> 00:26:52.111
<v Speaker 1>We all agree that scowling is sometimes </v>
<v Speaker 1>anger and so it becomes anger in a very </v>

446
00:26:54.461 --> 00:26:59.461
<v Speaker 1>real way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just like little pieces of paper become </v>

447
00:26:59.461 --> 00:27:02.671
<v Speaker 1>money.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it sounds like you kind of think </v>

448
00:27:02.671 --> 00:27:03.050
<v Speaker 1>about the expression of emotions,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that kind of language as an extension of</v>

449
00:27:03.051 --> 00:27:08.051
<v Speaker 1>a language that we'll learn in the same </v>
<v Speaker 1>way that we've collectively agree on a </v>

450
00:27:08.051 --> 00:27:11.900
<v Speaker 1>language and the lexicon and a how we </v>
<v Speaker 1>use that language.</v>

451
00:27:12.660 --> 00:27:14.190
<v Speaker 2>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You could think of it that way.</v>

452
00:27:14.191 --> 00:27:15.870
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>everything,</v>

453
00:27:16.230 --> 00:27:21.230
<v Speaker 2>everything in our culture is almost </v>
<v Speaker 2>everything in our culture is a function </v>

454
00:27:24.041 --> 00:27:25.960
<v Speaker 2>of social reality in this way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

455
00:27:26.540 --> 00:27:31.540
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we are citizens of a country because we </v>

456
00:27:31.540 --> 00:27:32.860
<v Speaker 2>all agree that the country exists more </v>
<v Speaker 2>or less.</v>

457
00:27:33.400 --> 00:27:34.750
<v Speaker 2>And I'm.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wow,</v>

458
00:27:34.751 --> 00:27:36.610
<v Speaker 2>you guys barely even laughed at that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

459
00:27:37.590 --> 00:27:41.140
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what's a revolution a revolution is when</v>

460
00:27:41.141 --> 00:27:43.360
<v Speaker 2>some people in the country withdraw </v>
<v Speaker 2>their consent.</v>

461
00:27:43.990 --> 00:27:47.040
<v Speaker 2>They no longer agree,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

462
00:27:47.100 --> 00:27:52.100
<v Speaker 2>A president has powers in a country </v>
<v Speaker 2>because we all agree that a president </v>

463
00:27:52.100 --> 00:27:55.731
<v Speaker 2>has powers.</v>
<v Speaker 2>President only has powers by virtue the </v>

464
00:27:55.731 --> 00:27:55.731
<v Speaker 2>fact that we all agree that he or she </v>
<v Speaker 2>has powers.</v>

465
00:27:55.800 --> 00:28:00.800
<v Speaker 2>If we stop agreeing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the president doesn't have those powers </v>

466
00:28:00.851 --> 00:28:03.190
<v Speaker 2>anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's very real.</v>

467
00:28:03.830 --> 00:28:08.830
<v Speaker 2>People's lives depend on outcomes of </v>
<v Speaker 2>real people depend on these social </v>

468
00:28:10.131 --> 00:28:15.131
<v Speaker 2>realities that we build and nurture and </v>
<v Speaker 2>we wire these social realities into the </v>

469
00:28:15.131 --> 00:28:17.510
<v Speaker 2>brains of our children as we socialize </v>
<v Speaker 2>them.</v>

470
00:28:17.690 --> 00:28:20.240
<v Speaker 2>And when people move from one culture to</v>
<v Speaker 2>another,</v>

471
00:28:20.300 --> 00:28:25.300
<v Speaker 2>they have to learn the new,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a social reality that they are faced </v>

472
00:28:25.300 --> 00:28:26.570
<v Speaker 2>with.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And if they don't,</v>

473
00:28:26.960 --> 00:28:31.960
<v Speaker 2>they get very sick physically.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because our ability to agree on what </v>

474
00:28:33.141 --> 00:28:37.070
<v Speaker 2>something means actually is important </v>
<v Speaker 2>for regulating our nervous systems.</v>

475
00:28:37.130 --> 00:28:39.260
<v Speaker 1>So can you speak to that a little bit?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

476
00:28:39.320 --> 00:28:44.320
<v Speaker 1>for machine learning methods,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for systems that learn to behave based </v>

477
00:28:44.511 --> 00:28:49.511
<v Speaker 1>on a certain reward,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's important to Kinda have some ground</v>

478
00:28:50.761 --> 00:28:55.761
<v Speaker 1>truth and learn.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So how do it sounds like the expression </v>

479
00:28:55.761 --> 00:29:00.621
<v Speaker 1>of emotion is learned.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Can you talk about how we learn to fit </v>

480
00:29:00.621 --> 00:29:05.140
<v Speaker 1>into our culture by expressing emotion </v>
<v Speaker 1>with our phase body,</v>

481
00:29:05.170 --> 00:29:06.820
<v Speaker 1>given the context,</v>
<v Speaker 1>given the rich,</v>

482
00:29:06.880 --> 00:29:08.830
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's that process look like?</v>

483
00:29:08.831 --> 00:29:11.840
<v Speaker 1>When does it happen?</v>
<v Speaker 1>How much?</v>

484
00:29:13.790 --> 00:29:15.940
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wrote a 400 page book,</v>

485
00:29:15.941 --> 00:29:18.140
<v Speaker 2>so I'll try to do it in like a couple </v>
<v Speaker 2>sentences.</v>

486
00:29:18.141 --> 00:29:19.240
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

487
00:29:21.020 --> 00:29:25.420
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so,</v>

488
00:29:25.780 --> 00:29:28.150
<v Speaker 2>so how does it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how does an infant learn anything?</v>

489
00:29:28.740 --> 00:29:30.600
<v Speaker 2>So an infant's born</v>

490
00:29:32.360 --> 00:29:34.490
<v Speaker 2>and it can't really do anything for </v>
<v Speaker 2>itself.</v>

491
00:29:35.300 --> 00:29:37.520
<v Speaker 2>It can't regulate its own nervous </v>
<v Speaker 2>system.</v>

492
00:29:37.640 --> 00:29:42.640
<v Speaker 2>It can't keep its body systems balanced.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is a term scientific term for this </v>

493
00:29:42.781 --> 00:29:47.781
<v Speaker 2>is allo stasis.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Allostasis is your brain's ability to </v>

494
00:29:47.781 --> 00:29:51.001
<v Speaker 2>predict what your body's going to need </v>
<v Speaker 2>before it needs it and tries to meet </v>

495
00:29:51.001 --> 00:29:54.991
<v Speaker 2>those needs before they arise.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So an example would be if you're going </v>

496
00:29:54.991 --> 00:29:57.010
<v Speaker 2>to stand up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if your brain's gonna stand you up,</v>

497
00:29:57.011 --> 00:29:59.650
<v Speaker 2>it has to raise your blood pressure </v>
<v Speaker 2>before it stands you up.</v>

498
00:30:00.280 --> 00:30:02.230
<v Speaker 2>If it doesn't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you'll fall.</v>

499
00:30:02.320 --> 00:30:05.140
<v Speaker 2>That's costly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>From metabolic standpoint,</v>

500
00:30:05.170 --> 00:30:07.120
<v Speaker 2>it's costly,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you'll hurt yourself.</v>

501
00:30:08.200 --> 00:30:12.130
<v Speaker 2>So an infant's brain can't do this very </v>
<v Speaker 2>well.</v>

502
00:30:13.570 --> 00:30:18.570
<v Speaker 2>An infant doesn't know when to go to </v>
<v Speaker 2>sleep and when to wake up and infant </v>

503
00:30:18.570 --> 00:30:19.870
<v Speaker 2>doesn't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>can't feed itself,</v>

504
00:30:19.871 --> 00:30:23.590
<v Speaker 2>can't regulate its own temperature,</v>
<v Speaker 2>someone else has to do it.</v>

505
00:30:24.340 --> 00:30:28.360
<v Speaker 2>And when someone does it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the infant is learning,</v>

506
00:30:28.860 --> 00:30:33.860
<v Speaker 2>the infant is learning,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's taking insights and sounds and </v>

507
00:30:34.241 --> 00:30:39.241
<v Speaker 2>smells and the physical sensations from </v>
<v Speaker 2>the body which are comfortable and </v>

508
00:30:41.291 --> 00:30:42.070
<v Speaker 2>pleasant.</v>

509
00:30:42.310 --> 00:30:45.910
<v Speaker 2>When the infant allo stasis is </v>
<v Speaker 2>maintained.</v>

510
00:30:47.410 --> 00:30:52.410
<v Speaker 2>So right from the Gecko,</v>
<v Speaker 2>an infant is learning statistical </v>

511
00:30:53.651 --> 00:30:55.300
<v Speaker 2>learning.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

512
00:30:55.870 --> 00:30:58.720
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the capturing events,</v>

513
00:30:59.020 --> 00:31:02.020
<v Speaker 2>including their consequence for the </v>
<v Speaker 2>infant's body.</v>

514
00:31:02.140 --> 00:31:04.090
<v Speaker 2>Some people think babies are born,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

515
00:31:04.120 --> 00:31:07.480
<v Speaker 2>attached already to their caregivers,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they're not actually.</v>

516
00:31:08.410 --> 00:31:10.690
<v Speaker 2>Infants don't even know what a caregiver</v>
<v Speaker 2>is.</v>

517
00:31:10.780 --> 00:31:14.230
<v Speaker 2>It's just that the caregiver is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're constantly meeting that infant's</v>

518
00:31:14.231 --> 00:31:17.020
<v Speaker 2>needs.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's how infant start to learn.</v>

519
00:31:17.200 --> 00:31:19.780
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if there are statistical regularities,</v>

520
00:31:19.781 --> 00:31:24.781
<v Speaker 2>like for example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>an infant is not born with the ability </v>

521
00:31:24.781 --> 00:31:27.691
<v Speaker 2>to recognize a face as a face,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it learns that in like the first </v>

522
00:31:27.691 --> 00:31:28.930
<v Speaker 2>couple of days of life.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why?</v>

523
00:31:29.020 --> 00:31:32.350
<v Speaker 2>Because human faces have some </v>
<v Speaker 2>statistical regularities to them,</v>

524
00:31:32.800 --> 00:31:33.820
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Two eyes,</v>

525
00:31:33.821 --> 00:31:37.300
<v Speaker 2>a nose and a mouth kind of in the same </v>
<v Speaker 2>place most of the time.</v>

526
00:31:38.260 --> 00:31:42.430
<v Speaker 2>So it learns really quickly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But here's the interesting thing,</v>

527
00:31:42.490 --> 00:31:47.490
<v Speaker 2>around three months of age,</v>
<v Speaker 2>infants start to learn what we call </v>

528
00:31:49.030 --> 00:31:50.980
<v Speaker 2>abstract categories.</v>

529
00:31:51.040 --> 00:31:56.040
<v Speaker 2>They start to learn that some things </v>
<v Speaker 2>which don't look the same or sound the </v>

530
00:31:56.040 --> 00:32:00.991
<v Speaker 2>same or smell the same,</v>
<v Speaker 2>actually have the same function.</v>

531
00:32:02.950 --> 00:32:05.860
<v Speaker 2>And how do they learn this?</v>
<v Speaker 2>They learn it with words.</v>

532
00:32:06.850 --> 00:32:09.580
<v Speaker 2>So if you do an experiment with a three </v>
<v Speaker 2>month old,</v>

533
00:32:09.820 --> 00:32:11.440
<v Speaker 2>three months old,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay?</v>

534
00:32:11.680 --> 00:32:14.770
<v Speaker 2>And you say that baby very,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very intentionally.</v>

535
00:32:14.950 --> 00:32:19.950
<v Speaker 2>Look Sweetie,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is a bug and you put the dog down </v>

536
00:32:22.180 --> 00:32:25.210
<v Speaker 2>and it makes a noise,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like a beep.</v>

537
00:32:26.470 --> 00:32:28.570
<v Speaker 2>And then you say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>

538
00:32:28.571 --> 00:32:32.000
<v Speaker 2>I don't have props.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then you have my wallet.</v>

539
00:32:32.230 --> 00:32:32.710
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

540
00:32:32.711 --> 00:32:33.880
<v Speaker 2>And then you say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>give me your wallet.</v>

541
00:32:34.040 --> 00:32:34.900
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>give me your wallet.</v>

542
00:32:36.610 --> 00:32:40.160
<v Speaker 2>And then you say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>look sweetie,</v>

543
00:32:40.250 --> 00:32:44.990
<v Speaker 2>this is a watch dog,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you put the walk down and it makes a</v>

544
00:32:44.991 --> 00:32:47.480
<v Speaker 2>beep.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you say,</v>

545
00:32:47.840 --> 00:32:52.840
<v Speaker 2>look sweetie,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is a watchdog that infant expects </v>

546
00:32:54.950 --> 00:32:58.460
<v Speaker 2>that object to beep.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why is that important?</v>

547
00:32:58.730 --> 00:33:03.730
<v Speaker 2>Because in the real experiments,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this might be yellow and squishy and I'm</v>

548
00:33:05.840 --> 00:33:10.840
<v Speaker 2>tall and this might be red and pointy </v>
<v Speaker 2>and you know,</v>

549
00:33:11.541 --> 00:33:13.430
<v Speaker 2>hard.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And this might be,</v>

550
00:33:13.460 --> 00:33:18.460
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so lots of different perceptual </v>

551
00:33:18.460 --> 00:33:18.460
<v Speaker 2>features.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But,</v>

552
00:33:18.460 --> 00:33:22.840
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the infant knows a learns that the </v>

553
00:33:24.561 --> 00:33:29.561
<v Speaker 2>word is inviting the infant to </v>
<v Speaker 2>understand that the function of those </v>

554
00:33:30.981 --> 00:33:35.060
<v Speaker 2>very different physical signals are </v>
<v Speaker 2>actually the same.</v>

555
00:33:35.180 --> 00:33:36.710
<v Speaker 2>Similarly,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can take,</v>

556
00:33:36.980 --> 00:33:41.980
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>six objects that are exactly identical </v>

557
00:33:41.980 --> 00:33:42.590
<v Speaker 2>in their physical features,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how they sound,</v>

558
00:33:42.591 --> 00:33:45.140
<v Speaker 2>how they smell,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what they feel like,</v>

559
00:33:45.460 --> 00:33:46.910
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what they look like.</v>

560
00:33:47.000 --> 00:33:52.000
<v Speaker 2>And you can name three of them with one </v>
<v Speaker 2>word and three of them with the other </v>

561
00:33:52.000 --> 00:33:53.870
<v Speaker 2>word.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the infant will understand that,</v>

562
00:33:53.871 --> 00:33:58.871
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>these are actually different objects </v>

563
00:33:58.871 --> 00:33:58.871
<v Speaker 2>that happens a little after,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

564
00:33:58.871 --> 00:33:59.030
<v Speaker 2>not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not as early as three months.</v>

565
00:33:59.300 --> 00:34:02.600
<v Speaker 2>But the point is that when we talk all </v>
<v Speaker 2>the time,</v>

566
00:34:02.601 --> 00:34:03.710
<v Speaker 2>we use words all the time.</v>

567
00:34:03.710 --> 00:34:06.740
<v Speaker 2>What do we do with infants?</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're constantly pointing things out and</v>

568
00:34:06.741 --> 00:34:08.630
<v Speaker 2>labeling them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is a dog,</v>

569
00:34:08.660 --> 00:34:10.880
<v Speaker 2>this is a cat.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're angry.</v>

570
00:34:10.910 --> 00:34:12.740
<v Speaker 2>This person sad.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

571
00:34:12.741 --> 00:34:14.960
<v Speaker 2>Mommy's really happy today.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

572
00:34:14.961 --> 00:34:16.460
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>mommy loves you.</v>

573
00:34:16.670 --> 00:34:19.550
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>daddy's really excited about this.</v>

574
00:34:19.640 --> 00:34:23.600
<v Speaker 2>And so on and so forth.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And infants learn really,</v>

575
00:34:23.601 --> 00:34:28.601
<v Speaker 2>really quickly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Words are considered to be kind of </v>

576
00:34:28.601 --> 00:34:31.361
<v Speaker 2>invitations to form abstract concepts.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That is the basis of almost all of the,</v>

577
00:34:34.220 --> 00:34:36.050
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

578
00:34:36.440 --> 00:34:40.130
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>mental categories that we,</v>

579
00:34:40.160 --> 00:34:41.310
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

580
00:34:41.680 --> 00:34:46.680
<v Speaker 2>that we,</v>
<v Speaker 2>mental events that we experienced were </v>

581
00:34:46.680 --> 00:34:48.560
<v Speaker 2>basically teaching children to form </v>
<v Speaker 2>these abstract categories,</v>

582
00:34:48.561 --> 00:34:53.561
<v Speaker 2>not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that's the basis of money and it's </v>

583
00:34:53.561 --> 00:34:54.050
<v Speaker 2>the basis of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

584
00:34:54.200 --> 00:34:58.250
<v Speaker 2>roles that we have with each other and </v>
<v Speaker 2>what we expect from each other.</v>

585
00:34:58.251 --> 00:35:03.251
<v Speaker 2>It's the basis of a lot of the sort of </v>
<v Speaker 2>functional categories that we use in </v>

586
00:35:03.251 --> 00:35:04.350
<v Speaker 2>everyday life.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We impose meaning on sensory,</v>

587
00:35:04.630 --> 00:35:09.630
<v Speaker 2>on sensory arrays that those sensory </v>
<v Speaker 2>raised in and of themselves don't </v>

588
00:35:09.630 --> 00:35:13.961
<v Speaker 2>necessarily have.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They only have that meaning because you </v>

589
00:35:13.961 --> 00:35:16.820
<v Speaker 2>and I both learned that that package of </v>
<v Speaker 2>sensory rate means something,</v>

590
00:35:16.821 --> 00:35:21.821
<v Speaker 2>so when I make that you can anticipate </v>
<v Speaker 2>what will happen next just because we've</v>

591
00:35:22.131 --> 00:35:26.920
<v Speaker 2>learned those are wired into our brains,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

592
00:35:26.930 --> 00:35:29.360
<v Speaker 2>in our culture and when we go to a </v>
<v Speaker 2>different culture,</v>

593
00:35:29.361 --> 00:35:32.480
<v Speaker 2>we have to learn sometimes different </v>
<v Speaker 2>packages,</v>

594
00:35:33.440 --> 00:35:38.440
<v Speaker 2>different mappings.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you're saying that there's a few </v>

595
00:35:38.440 --> 00:35:38.440
<v Speaker 2>sources of sensory data</v>

596
00:35:38.440 --> 00:35:43.040
<v Speaker 1>and a few building blocks inside us,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the feelings of some kind that we </v>

597
00:35:43.411 --> 00:35:47.070
<v Speaker 1>learned to then from an early they were </v>
<v Speaker 1>combined with those,</v>

598
00:35:47.320 --> 00:35:47.630
<v Speaker 1>or</v>

599
00:35:47.800 --> 00:35:52.800
<v Speaker 2>part of what your brain is doing is it's</v>
<v Speaker 2>trying to make sense of the sensory </v>

600
00:35:52.800 --> 00:35:55.530
<v Speaker 2>array around it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So from your brain's person.</v>

601
00:35:55.750 --> 00:36:00.750
<v Speaker 2>So from your brain's perspective,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just think about it from your brain's </v>

602
00:36:00.750 --> 00:36:02.340
<v Speaker 2>perspective,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your brain's perspective.</v>

603
00:36:03.180 --> 00:36:07.410
<v Speaker 2>It spends it's entire life trapped in a </v>
<v Speaker 2>dark,</v>

604
00:36:07.411 --> 00:36:12.411
<v Speaker 2>silent box and it has to make sense of </v>
<v Speaker 2>what's going on around in the world.</v>

605
00:36:16.971 --> 00:36:20.240
<v Speaker 2>So that knows what to do to keep itself </v>
<v Speaker 2>alive,</v>

606
00:36:20.300 --> 00:36:24.470
<v Speaker 2>right and well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it has to.</v>

607
00:36:25.290 --> 00:36:28.110
<v Speaker 2>It has to know what to do based on,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it has to know what,</v>

608
00:36:28.170 --> 00:36:33.170
<v Speaker 2>what's happening on around it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>only from the effects that it receives </v>

609
00:36:33.170 --> 00:36:37.700
<v Speaker 2>through the sensory systems of the body.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So a flash of light.</v>

610
00:36:38.190 --> 00:36:39.990
<v Speaker 2>What's a flash of light?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It could be anything.</v>

611
00:36:40.710 --> 00:36:41.550
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what,</v>

612
00:36:42.000 --> 00:36:43.950
<v Speaker 2>what's a like a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like a siren.</v>

613
00:36:43.951 --> 00:36:45.600
<v Speaker 2>The siren could be,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

614
00:36:45.601 --> 00:36:50.601
<v Speaker 2>a firetruck or it could be um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>somebody's car alarm went off or it </v>

615
00:36:50.671 --> 00:36:52.640
<v Speaker 2>could be a doorbell or it could be </v>
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

616
00:36:52.750 --> 00:36:57.090
<v Speaker 2>Any particular sensory cue could have </v>
<v Speaker 2>multiple causes.</v>

617
00:36:57.350 --> 00:36:59.970
<v Speaker 2>So your brain's trapped basically in </v>
<v Speaker 2>your skull.</v>

618
00:37:00.060 --> 00:37:05.060
<v Speaker 2>And all it gets are the effects,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the sensory effects of stuff that </v>

619
00:37:05.361 --> 00:37:10.361
<v Speaker 2>happens in the world,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it has to figure out what those </v>

620
00:37:10.361 --> 00:37:11.840
<v Speaker 2>things are so that it knows what to do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So how does it do that?</v>

621
00:37:12.140 --> 00:37:17.140
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it has something else that it can draw </v>

622
00:37:17.140 --> 00:37:17.140
<v Speaker 2>on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It has your past experiences.</v>

623
00:37:17.140 --> 00:37:21.400
<v Speaker 2>Your brain basically is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it doesn't store experiences from the </v>

624
00:37:21.631 --> 00:37:24.810
<v Speaker 2>past.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It can reconstitute them in its wiring.</v>

625
00:37:26.840 --> 00:37:31.840
<v Speaker 2>And that's what it uses to guess at what</v>
<v Speaker 2>those sensory cues mean of those sensory</v>

626
00:37:33.861 --> 00:37:37.160
<v Speaker 2>changes meet.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So in one situation,</v>

627
00:37:38.390 --> 00:37:40.730
<v Speaker 2>a siren means one thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in another situation,</v>

628
00:37:40.731 --> 00:37:45.731
<v Speaker 2>it means another,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a flash of light means one thing in one </v>

629
00:37:45.731 --> 00:37:45.731
<v Speaker 2>situation and a different thing and </v>
<v Speaker 2>another.</v>

630
00:37:45.731 --> 00:37:50.010
<v Speaker 2>So your brain is using past experience </v>
<v Speaker 2>to make guesses about what these sensory</v>

631
00:37:50.240 --> 00:37:54.140
<v Speaker 2>changes mean so that it knows what to do</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it,</v>

632
00:37:54.220 --> 00:37:57.800
<v Speaker 2>it has the same relationship to the </v>
<v Speaker 2>sensory changes in your body.</v>

633
00:37:57.950 --> 00:38:01.330
<v Speaker 2>What's an ache in your stomach?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

634
00:38:01.750 --> 00:38:04.990
<v Speaker 2>it could be hunger,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it could be anger,</v>

635
00:38:05.230 --> 00:38:07.150
<v Speaker 2>it could be discussed,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it could be longing,</v>

636
00:38:07.720 --> 00:38:12.350
<v Speaker 2>it can be nausea.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not that there's one,</v>

637
00:38:12.670 --> 00:38:17.670
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>ache in your stomach for nausea and </v>

638
00:38:17.670 --> 00:38:17.670
<v Speaker 2>another ache in your stomach for hunger.</v>

639
00:38:19.730 --> 00:38:24.260
<v Speaker 2>There are many aches and your stomach,</v>
<v Speaker 2>benny different feelings of achiness for</v>

640
00:38:24.261 --> 00:38:26.960
<v Speaker 2>nausea and many different feelings of </v>
<v Speaker 2>achiness for hunger.</v>

641
00:38:26.961 --> 00:38:30.920
<v Speaker 2>And sometimes they overlap.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So your brain has to make the same kinds</v>

642
00:38:30.921 --> 00:38:35.921
<v Speaker 2>of guesses about what's going on in your</v>
<v Speaker 2>body as it does about what the sensory </v>

643
00:38:35.921 --> 00:38:37.360
<v Speaker 2>events meet in the world.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's really what it's doing.</v>

644
00:38:37.370 --> 00:38:42.370
<v Speaker 2>It's guessing and making sense of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>sensory ray so that it knows what to do </v>

645
00:38:42.370 --> 00:38:44.290
<v Speaker 2>next.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And when it guesses wrong,</v>

646
00:38:44.470 --> 00:38:46.720
<v Speaker 2>it takes in that the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

647
00:38:46.721 --> 00:38:47.650
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the sort of,</v>

648
00:38:47.651 --> 00:38:52.651
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the information that it didn't predict </v>

649
00:38:52.651 --> 00:38:52.651
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

650
00:38:52.651 --> 00:38:52.990
<v Speaker 2>which,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

651
00:38:53.050 --> 00:38:55.870
<v Speaker 2>in psychology we have a really fancy </v>
<v Speaker 2>name for that.</v>

652
00:38:56.060 --> 00:39:01.060
<v Speaker 2>We call it learning your brain takes in </v>
<v Speaker 2>the information that it didn't predict,</v>

653
00:39:01.560 --> 00:39:06.560
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so that it can predict better than the </v>

654
00:39:06.560 --> 00:39:06.560
<v Speaker 2>next time to make sense of things the </v>
<v Speaker 2>next time.</v>

655
00:39:07.700 --> 00:39:11.540
<v Speaker 1>So you kind of answered this a little </v>
<v Speaker 1>bit.</v>

656
00:39:11.700 --> 00:39:16.700
<v Speaker 1>I'd like to elaborate on it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you were to build a robot that </v>

657
00:39:16.700 --> 00:39:18.890
<v Speaker 1>performs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe passes the turing test or performs</v>

658
00:39:19.100 --> 00:39:23.290
<v Speaker 1>at the low bar level of instead of </v>
<v Speaker 1>myself here today,</v>

659
00:39:23.291 --> 00:39:26.560
<v Speaker 1>it will be a robot talking to you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It would be convincing as a human,</v>

660
00:39:26.830 --> 00:39:29.890
<v Speaker 1>how would you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what kind of,</v>

661
00:39:30.770 --> 00:39:32.720
<v Speaker 1>how would you build that system in a </v>
<v Speaker 1>sense?</v>

662
00:39:33.130 --> 00:39:38.130
<v Speaker 1>I'm in paralleling the infants.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What essential aspect of the infant </v>

663
00:39:38.180 --> 00:39:40.670
<v Speaker 1>experience do you think is important?</v>

664
00:39:42.160 --> 00:39:42.990
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

665
00:39:43.350 --> 00:39:44.210
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't,</v>

666
00:39:44.270 --> 00:39:46.730
<v Speaker 2>I'm not a computer scientist so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

667
00:39:47.000 --> 00:39:52.000
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so the way that I would say it is it </v>

668
00:39:52.000 --> 00:39:54.611
<v Speaker 2>needs to have a body.</v>
<v Speaker 2>These have something like physical </v>

669
00:39:54.611 --> 00:39:55.690
<v Speaker 2>systems or an analogy to physical </v>
<v Speaker 2>systems.</v>

670
00:39:55.960 --> 00:39:57.760
<v Speaker 2>It has to do something analogous to </v>
<v Speaker 2>Alice.</v>

671
00:39:57.800 --> 00:39:58.970
<v Speaker 2>Dcis.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So</v>

672
00:39:59.400 --> 00:40:04.400
<v Speaker 1>what side to elaborate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what would be the goal for the </v>

673
00:40:04.400 --> 00:40:08.471
<v Speaker 1>system?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You kind of mentioned previously that </v>

674
00:40:08.471 --> 00:40:09.560
<v Speaker 1>the goal will be to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for the brain to just stabilize itself.</v>

675
00:40:09.730 --> 00:40:14.730
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not that the brain is stabilized </v>

676
00:40:14.730 --> 00:40:14.730
<v Speaker 2>now you have.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So people talk about reward.</v>

677
00:40:14.730 --> 00:40:14.730
<v Speaker 2>What does reward?</v>

678
00:40:15.840 --> 00:40:20.840
<v Speaker 1>Machine learning is pretty easy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's something that it's mathematical.</v>

679
00:40:22.891 --> 00:40:25.290
<v Speaker 1>So it's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's no philosophy to it.</v>

680
00:40:26.140 --> 00:40:27.830
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's philosophy that everything,</v>

681
00:40:28.170 --> 00:40:33.170
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Whether you admit it or not as a </v>

682
00:40:33.170 --> 00:40:33.170
<v Speaker 2>different story.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

683
00:40:33.170 --> 00:40:33.170
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

684
00:40:33.170 --> 00:40:35.800
<v Speaker 1>you wanted to play a game of chess play </v>
<v Speaker 1>given go,</v>

685
00:40:35.801 --> 00:40:40.801
<v Speaker 1>you want to pick up a water bottle is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But what is reward existence?</v>

686
00:40:43.990 --> 00:40:44.010
<v Speaker 1>I</v>

687
00:40:47.330 --> 00:40:50.390
<v Speaker 2>don't mean it's actually not reward.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Don't meet as effort,</v>

688
00:40:50.510 --> 00:40:53.660
<v Speaker 2>don't meet as necessary for effort.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not necessarily for word.</v>

689
00:40:53.860 --> 00:40:57.370
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's commonly if you read the </v>
<v Speaker 2>most,</v>

690
00:40:57.710 --> 00:41:02.710
<v Speaker 2>those uptodate literature,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that is what you'll see that it's </v>

691
00:41:02.710 --> 00:41:05.600
<v Speaker 2>actually people can,</v>
<v Speaker 2>animals can find things rewarding,</v>

692
00:41:06.010 --> 00:41:07.760
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>can be without,</v>

693
00:41:07.761 --> 00:41:09.740
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>without domain actually.</v>

694
00:41:09.741 --> 00:41:10.760
<v Speaker 2>But they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

695
00:41:10.890 --> 00:41:12.650
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they need to open me to move,</v>

696
00:41:13.400 --> 00:41:16.190
<v Speaker 2>they need job mean to encode that to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to learn information.</v>

697
00:41:16.191 --> 00:41:19.250
<v Speaker 2>So it's really for an effort that is </v>
<v Speaker 2>required to,</v>

698
00:41:19.490 --> 00:41:21.470
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>work towards getting a reward,</v>

699
00:41:21.560 --> 00:41:23.470
<v Speaker 2>I would say.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And um,</v>

700
00:41:23.930 --> 00:41:25.820
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when the,</v>

701
00:41:25.880 --> 00:41:28.190
<v Speaker 2>when a brain and animal brand a human,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

702
00:41:28.490 --> 00:41:32.480
<v Speaker 2>any kind of animal brain,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Ms Dot predicts what the reward will be.</v>

703
00:41:32.660 --> 00:41:37.660
<v Speaker 2>That's where see a real surge of </v>
<v Speaker 2>dopamine because the animal has to </v>

704
00:41:37.660 --> 00:41:42.071
<v Speaker 2>adjust its action.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But the reward is basically I'm bringing</v>

705
00:41:43.700 --> 00:41:45.560
<v Speaker 2>the body back into Alice Asis.</v>

706
00:41:46.100 --> 00:41:49.430
<v Speaker 2>It feels good when that happens and </v>
<v Speaker 2>people will,</v>

707
00:41:49.500 --> 00:41:54.500
<v Speaker 2>an animals will work tremendously hard </v>
<v Speaker 2>to have that happen.</v>

708
00:41:55.800 --> 00:41:57.550
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

709
00:41:57.551 --> 00:41:59.950
<v Speaker 2>what is motivation?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Motivation is,</v>

710
00:42:00.310 --> 00:42:05.310
<v Speaker 2>is expanding resources to get a reward.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So basically if,</v>

711
00:42:09.120 --> 00:42:14.120
<v Speaker 2>if you don't have something like </v>
<v Speaker 2>physical systems that have to be kept in</v>

712
00:42:17.561 --> 00:42:22.561
<v Speaker 2>balance,</v>
<v Speaker 2>water mean for humans or for actually </v>

713
00:42:22.561 --> 00:42:26.631
<v Speaker 2>any living creature on this planet,</v>
<v Speaker 2>even single cell organisms.</v>

714
00:42:29.591 --> 00:42:32.140
<v Speaker 2>Actually there's an analogy to what </v>
<v Speaker 2>we're talking about here.</v>

715
00:42:32.590 --> 00:42:33.670
<v Speaker 2>Two,</v>
<v Speaker 2>two brains.</v>

716
00:42:34.030 --> 00:42:35.890
<v Speaker 2>But you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Salt,</v>

717
00:42:36.460 --> 00:42:38.110
<v Speaker 2>water,</v>
<v Speaker 2>glucose,</v>

718
00:42:38.320 --> 00:42:43.320
<v Speaker 2>all these systems have to be kept in </v>
<v Speaker 2>balance and they have to be kept in </v>

719
00:42:43.320 --> 00:42:44.830
<v Speaker 2>balance in a very,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very efficient way.</v>

720
00:42:46.240 --> 00:42:49.450
<v Speaker 2>And that's the motivating so-called </v>
<v Speaker 2>motivating force.</v>

721
00:42:49.451 --> 00:42:52.090
<v Speaker 2>Really that's what,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's what,</v>

722
00:42:52.120 --> 00:42:53.740
<v Speaker 2>that's what really brains are for.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So.</v>

723
00:42:55.230 --> 00:43:00.230
<v Speaker 2>And that is the basis,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the consequence of that regulation are </v>

724
00:43:00.230 --> 00:43:05.211
<v Speaker 2>the basis of effective feelings which </v>
<v Speaker 2>are for many,</v>

725
00:43:05.701 --> 00:43:09.840
<v Speaker 2>many creatures on this planet.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A property of consciousness.</v>

726
00:43:11.040 --> 00:43:13.980
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So maybe if it's okay,</v>

727
00:43:13.981 --> 00:43:15.600
<v Speaker 1>we'll take some questions from the </v>
<v Speaker 1>audience.</v>

728
00:43:15.800 --> 00:43:18.110
<v Speaker 1>But first,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let me ask the last question is.</v>

729
00:43:18.360 --> 00:43:23.360
<v Speaker 1>So on building on the robot question,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how would you build the same kind of </v>

730
00:43:24.121 --> 00:43:28.860
<v Speaker 1>robot that you would be able to as a </v>
<v Speaker 1>human being fallen in love with?</v>

731
00:43:31.550 --> 00:43:32.180
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

732
00:43:32.181 --> 00:43:36.220
<v Speaker 2>people fall in love with their cars.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They fall in love with.</v>

733
00:43:37.810 --> 00:43:41.680
<v Speaker 2>They fall in love with their blankets.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They fall in love with their toys,</v>

734
00:43:42.340 --> 00:43:43.270
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you don't need.</v>

735
00:43:43.390 --> 00:43:48.390
<v Speaker 2>It.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Doesn't need much to fall in love with </v>

736
00:43:48.390 --> 00:43:48.390
<v Speaker 2>something.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The question is,</v>

737
00:43:48.390 --> 00:43:48.390
<v Speaker 2>will it love you back</v>

738
00:43:50.860 --> 00:43:54.190
<v Speaker 1>I w I would elaborate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think so,</v>

739
00:43:54.900 --> 00:43:59.900
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think you're answering that love in </v>

740
00:43:59.900 --> 00:44:00.450
<v Speaker 1>the way we're defining it loosely in </v>
<v Speaker 1>poetry and culture is a,</v>

741
00:44:00.490 --> 00:44:05.490
<v Speaker 1>is a social construct and it's relative.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What I mean is sort of the idea of </v>

742
00:44:05.721 --> 00:44:10.721
<v Speaker 1>monogamous,</v>
<v Speaker 1>long term love that we have deep </v>

743
00:44:10.721 --> 00:44:11.390
<v Speaker 1>connection with other human beings that </v>
<v Speaker 1>we have.</v>

744
00:44:11.420 --> 00:44:14.820
<v Speaker 1>You're saying you could do the same with</v>
<v Speaker 1>a car like a nice 69 Mustang.</v>

745
00:44:14.940 --> 00:44:16.230
<v Speaker 2>Are you telling me that you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>

746
00:44:16.270 --> 00:44:19.260
<v Speaker 2>you're telling me that you've never,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you don't know anyone who was so in love</v>

747
00:44:19.261 --> 00:44:20.550
<v Speaker 2>with their car that you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

748
00:44:20.880 --> 00:44:22.460
<v Speaker 2>Now here's the thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So one.</v>

749
00:44:22.720 --> 00:44:24.090
<v Speaker 2>So here's the thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we,</v>

750
00:44:24.091 --> 00:44:25.950
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we are social animals.</v>

751
00:44:25.951 --> 00:44:27.420
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What does that mean?</v>

752
00:44:27.450 --> 00:44:32.450
<v Speaker 2>What does it mean to be a social animal?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It means that we regulate each other's </v>

753
00:44:32.450 --> 00:44:32.450
<v Speaker 2>nervous.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So our brain,</v>

754
00:44:32.450 --> 00:44:36.150
<v Speaker 2>my brain isn't just regulating my </v>
<v Speaker 2>nervous system right now.</v>

755
00:44:36.240 --> 00:44:39.930
<v Speaker 2>It's regulating yours and actually it's </v>
<v Speaker 2>regulating other,</v>

756
00:44:39.990 --> 00:44:42.450
<v Speaker 2>other peoples in the audience too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And vice versa.</v>

757
00:44:42.630 --> 00:44:44.130
<v Speaker 2>And why is that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

758
00:44:44.131 --> 00:44:46.590
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>other animals do it too.</v>

759
00:44:46.740 --> 00:44:49.620
<v Speaker 2>We're just really good at it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But other animals,</v>

760
00:44:49.621 --> 00:44:52.500
<v Speaker 2>like there are some insects that are </v>
<v Speaker 2>social species.</v>

761
00:44:52.501 --> 00:44:54.150
<v Speaker 2>They regulate each other's nervous </v>
<v Speaker 2>systems,</v>

762
00:44:54.151 --> 00:44:59.151
<v Speaker 2>they do it with chemicals,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they do it with smell primarily and a </v>

763
00:44:59.151 --> 00:45:00.300
<v Speaker 2>little bit with touch like earwigs will,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

764
00:45:00.360 --> 00:45:05.360
<v Speaker 2>like they could actually,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have this great picture of this like </v>

765
00:45:05.360 --> 00:45:05.790
<v Speaker 2>totally disgusting looking little bug,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's like,</v>

766
00:45:06.260 --> 00:45:07.170
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>cuddling.</v>

767
00:45:07.170 --> 00:45:10.180
<v Speaker 2>It's little baby,</v>
<v Speaker 2>ugly little ugly baby bug too.</v>

768
00:45:10.820 --> 00:45:12.860
<v Speaker 2>It's adorable picture.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

769
00:45:12.930 --> 00:45:15.450
<v Speaker 2>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what about mammals like rats?</v>

770
00:45:15.451 --> 00:45:18.240
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they also use chemicals like smell,</v>

771
00:45:18.390 --> 00:45:22.470
<v Speaker 2>but they also use touch and to some </v>
<v Speaker 2>extent,</v>

772
00:45:22.900 --> 00:45:24.510
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they also use sound.</v>

773
00:45:24.540 --> 00:45:29.540
<v Speaker 2>These hearing primates add vision.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And as primates we do all,</v>

774
00:45:30.331 --> 00:45:32.970
<v Speaker 2>we use all of those senses to regulate </v>
<v Speaker 2>each other.</v>

775
00:45:33.150 --> 00:45:37.530
<v Speaker 2>And we also use something else words,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

776
00:45:37.531 --> 00:45:39.390
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And words.</v>

777
00:45:39.450 --> 00:45:44.450
<v Speaker 2>The systems in our brains that allow us </v>
<v Speaker 2>to speak and allow us to understand </v>

778
00:45:44.450 --> 00:45:49.401
<v Speaker 2>words are directly connected to the </v>
<v Speaker 2>parts of the brain stem that controls </v>

779
00:45:51.031 --> 00:45:53.010
<v Speaker 2>the body.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't mean like there are a bunch of,</v>

780
00:45:53.011 --> 00:45:54.930
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean Monta synaptic,</v>

781
00:45:54.931 --> 00:45:59.931
<v Speaker 2>[inaudible] connected.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So exactly the same systems in your </v>

782
00:45:59.931 --> 00:46:03.501
<v Speaker 2>brain that are important for you to be </v>
<v Speaker 2>able to understand language and to speak</v>

783
00:46:05.460 --> 00:46:10.460
<v Speaker 2>are also directly directly affecting the</v>
<v Speaker 2>systems of your body.</v>

784
00:46:11.880 --> 00:46:16.880
<v Speaker 2>And that is why I can say something to </v>
<v Speaker 2>somebody I can speak to you and I can </v>

785
00:46:17.431 --> 00:46:22.431
<v Speaker 2>have an impact on the nervous systems of</v>
<v Speaker 2>people all the way at the back of this </v>

786
00:46:22.431 --> 00:46:23.880
<v Speaker 2>auditorium without they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

787
00:46:23.940 --> 00:46:25.650
<v Speaker 2>maybe they can see me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Maybe they can't.</v>

788
00:46:25.830 --> 00:46:27.840
<v Speaker 2>Maybe they can.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hopefully they can smell me.</v>

789
00:46:28.020 --> 00:46:30.780
<v Speaker 2>Maybe they can hear me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Maybe they know that they can,</v>

790
00:46:30.781 --> 00:46:33.240
<v Speaker 2>if they hear me speak words,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can affect their nervous systems.</v>

791
00:46:33.900 --> 00:46:37.500
<v Speaker 2>That's why telephone works.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's why telephone works where you can</v>

792
00:46:37.501 --> 00:46:40.650
<v Speaker 2>feel connected to someone just merely by</v>
<v Speaker 2>hearing their voice,</v>

793
00:46:41.100 --> 00:46:46.100
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because the sound of their voice has an </v>

794
00:46:46.100 --> 00:46:46.100
<v Speaker 2>effect on your nervous system.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It can,</v>

795
00:46:46.100 --> 00:46:48.180
<v Speaker 2>it can make you breathe faster,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it can make you breathe slower.</v>

796
00:46:48.330 --> 00:46:53.330
<v Speaker 2>And the words also have an effect.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because when I say a word like,</v>

797
00:46:54.700 --> 00:46:56.670
<v Speaker 2>mm,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I dunno.</v>

798
00:46:57.300 --> 00:47:00.840
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when I say word like car,</v>

799
00:47:01.770 --> 00:47:03.120
<v Speaker 2>that's a short form.</v>

800
00:47:04.200 --> 00:47:08.400
<v Speaker 2>I have a bunch of mental features in my </v>
<v Speaker 2>mind when I say the word car,</v>

801
00:47:08.490 --> 00:47:12.420
<v Speaker 2>and I say that word and that invokes </v>
<v Speaker 2>those similar mental features,</v>

802
00:47:12.421 --> 00:47:17.421
<v Speaker 2>maybe not identical,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but similar enough that invokes it in </v>

803
00:47:17.421 --> 00:47:20.991
<v Speaker 2>your mind and your mind is made by your </v>
<v Speaker 2>brain.</v>

804
00:47:22.950 --> 00:47:26.190
<v Speaker 2>So it invokes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if I just say the word car,</v>

805
00:47:26.970 --> 00:47:31.970
<v Speaker 2>there are changes in your motor system </v>
<v Speaker 2>that would be exactly the same or very </v>

806
00:47:33.011 --> 00:47:36.690
<v Speaker 2>close as if you were actually in a car,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

807
00:47:36.990 --> 00:47:41.990
<v Speaker 2>So this is something that we do and the </v>
<v Speaker 2>fact we're attachment comes from an </v>

808
00:47:46.301 --> 00:47:51.301
<v Speaker 2>infant to a caregiver or um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or two lovers or two really close </v>

809
00:47:51.851 --> 00:47:56.851
<v Speaker 2>friends comes from the ability that we </v>
<v Speaker 2>have to regulate each other's nervous </v>

810
00:47:57.001 --> 00:47:57.600
<v Speaker 2>systems.</v>

811
00:48:00.110 --> 00:48:02.980
<v Speaker 2>And that is why,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

812
00:48:04.080 --> 00:48:06.140
<v Speaker 2>when you don't have that kind of </v>
<v Speaker 2>attachment,</v>

813
00:48:06.910 --> 00:48:11.910
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you die sooner on average seven years </v>

814
00:48:11.910 --> 00:48:13.210
<v Speaker 2>sooner.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Loneliness kills.</v>

815
00:48:13.211 --> 00:48:18.211
<v Speaker 2>I always tell my daughter,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my daughter's 19 years old and I always </v>

816
00:48:18.211 --> 00:48:18.211
<v Speaker 2>tell her,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

817
00:48:18.211 --> 00:48:18.211
<v Speaker 2>breaking up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when you break up with someone,</v>

818
00:48:18.211 --> 00:48:21.550
<v Speaker 2>it feels like it will kill you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it won't.</v>

819
00:48:22.100 --> 00:48:27.100
<v Speaker 2>Loneliness however will kill you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It will kill you on average seven years </v>

820
00:48:29.841 --> 00:48:34.070
<v Speaker 2>earlier than it would if you didn't have</v>
<v Speaker 2>a an attachment,</v>

821
00:48:34.820 --> 00:48:39.820
<v Speaker 2>and that's because our nervous systems,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as our bodies got really complex through</v>

822
00:48:42.441 --> 00:48:46.830
<v Speaker 2>evolution and our brains got bigger,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they could only get so big.</v>

823
00:48:48.870 --> 00:48:53.870
<v Speaker 2>There are constraints on how big any </v>
<v Speaker 2>brain can get that have to do with </v>

824
00:48:53.870 --> 00:48:56.610
<v Speaker 2>birthing the infant,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it also has to do with the metabolic</v>

825
00:48:56.611 --> 00:49:00.330
<v Speaker 2>cost of a brain.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Your brain is really expensive.</v>

826
00:49:00.360 --> 00:49:03.330
<v Speaker 2>My brain really expensive.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Three pounds,</v>

827
00:49:03.740 --> 00:49:06.980
<v Speaker 2>20 percent of your metabolic budget.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a lot.</v>

828
00:49:07.130 --> 00:49:12.130
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and so what did evolution do to solve </v>

829
00:49:12.130 --> 00:49:13.360
<v Speaker 2>this problem?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

830
00:49:13.570 --> 00:49:18.570
<v Speaker 2>it couldn't make our brains any bigger,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so it just in trained other brains to </v>

831
00:49:18.570 --> 00:49:22.951
<v Speaker 2>help manage our nervous systems so you </v>
<v Speaker 2>bear the burden of other peoples' alice </v>

832
00:49:23.830 --> 00:49:28.600
<v Speaker 2>basis and they bear the burden of yours.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Not always at the same time,</v>

833
00:49:28.750 --> 00:49:30.760
<v Speaker 2>but that's what it means to give people </v>
<v Speaker 2>support.</v>

834
00:49:31.340 --> 00:49:36.340
<v Speaker 2>When someone,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when you're feeling horrible and </v>

835
00:49:36.340 --> 00:49:37.190
<v Speaker 2>somebody pats you on the back or says </v>
<v Speaker 2>nice words to you or gives you a hug,</v>

836
00:49:37.370 --> 00:49:42.370
<v Speaker 2>they are physically having an effect on </v>
<v Speaker 2>your body that they are helping your </v>

837
00:49:42.410 --> 00:49:46.790
<v Speaker 2>body to maintain aloe status at a time </v>
<v Speaker 2>when your brain probably couldn't manage</v>

838
00:49:46.791 --> 00:49:51.791
<v Speaker 2>it on its own.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so the basis of love or attachment </v>

839
00:49:51.791 --> 00:49:56.200
<v Speaker 2>is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is basically that it's the ability to </v>

840
00:49:56.200 --> 00:49:57.230
<v Speaker 2>affect each other's nervous systems in a</v>
<v Speaker 2>positive way.</v>

841
00:49:57.380 --> 00:49:59.840
<v Speaker 2>Like always say to people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

842
00:49:59.841 --> 00:50:04.280
<v Speaker 2>the best thing for nervous system,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a human nervous system is another human.</v>

843
00:50:05.360 --> 00:50:10.360
<v Speaker 2>And the worst thing for a human nervous </v>
<v Speaker 2>system is another human.</v>

844
00:50:13.910 --> 00:50:15.170
<v Speaker 2>Because we're social animals.</v>

845
00:50:17.010 --> 00:50:22.010
<v Speaker 1>Beautifully put.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So maybe a few questions in the </v>

846
00:50:22.010 --> 00:50:22.010
<v Speaker 1>audience.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you mind if there's,</v>

847
00:50:22.010 --> 00:50:23.460
<v Speaker 1>there's microphones on both sides.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Go ahead.</v>

848
00:50:23.700 --> 00:50:28.130
<v Speaker 1>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Thanks for talking</v>

849
00:50:28.190 --> 00:50:30.050
<v Speaker 3>here.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're saying cool stuff,</v>

850
00:50:31.970 --> 00:50:36.970
<v Speaker 3>not a question.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'll take it.</v>

851
00:50:41.310 --> 00:50:43.650
<v Speaker 1>So thinking about what you were saying </v>
<v Speaker 1>about reward,</v>

852
00:50:43.651 --> 00:50:48.651
<v Speaker 1>and I'm wondering first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is he described it as a returned to </v>

853
00:50:49.381 --> 00:50:54.381
<v Speaker 1>Alice.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Asis is reward in any way linked to the.</v>

854
00:50:56.180 --> 00:51:00.660
<v Speaker 1>I just like the reinforcement of </v>
<v Speaker 1>pathways or behavior.</v>

855
00:51:00.661 --> 00:51:02.490
<v Speaker 1>So that the next time you get that </v>
<v Speaker 1>stimulus,</v>

856
00:51:03.270 --> 00:51:05.520
<v Speaker 1>you will,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you'll respond in the same way.</v>

857
00:51:06.390 --> 00:51:08.620
<v Speaker 1>And I'm also wondering about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

858
00:51:08.640 --> 00:51:12.230
<v Speaker 1>the link between the desire for Elo </v>
<v Speaker 1>spaces</v>

859
00:51:12.890 --> 00:51:17.180
<v Speaker 2>and the need for novelty and then need </v>
<v Speaker 2>to like explore our environment.</v>

860
00:51:17.390 --> 00:51:22.390
<v Speaker 2>It's a really great question.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the second question is so much more </v>

861
00:51:22.881 --> 00:51:26.270
<v Speaker 2>interesting than the first actually.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So let me say this,</v>

862
00:51:26.271 --> 00:51:27.320
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

863
00:51:28.490 --> 00:51:31.340
<v Speaker 2>that uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there is a need for novelty.</v>

864
00:51:31.820 --> 00:51:35.600
<v Speaker 2>The need differs,</v>
<v Speaker 2>fried for different people.</v>

865
00:51:35.660 --> 00:51:38.300
<v Speaker 2>I will say novelty.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

866
00:51:38.390 --> 00:51:40.560
<v Speaker 2>so first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

867
00:51:42.160 --> 00:51:47.160
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we can think about the need for novelty </v>

868
00:51:47.160 --> 00:51:50.951
<v Speaker 2>in a really proximal way where we can </v>
<v Speaker 2>think about it in a really distilled way</v>

869
00:51:51.580 --> 00:51:56.580
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but basically when I say that a brain is</v>

870
00:51:58.141 --> 00:52:01.770
<v Speaker 2>organized or,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or engineered for metabolic efficiency,</v>

871
00:52:01.771 --> 00:52:06.771
<v Speaker 2>that doesn't mean that the goal is to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to only ever have your prediction.</v>

872
00:52:08.810 --> 00:52:10.520
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your brain is predicting all the time to</v>

873
00:52:10.521 --> 00:52:12.860
<v Speaker 2>always have its predictions completely </v>
<v Speaker 2>perfect.</v>

874
00:52:12.861 --> 00:52:16.160
<v Speaker 2>So you'll never learn nothing because </v>
<v Speaker 2>you'll be bored out of your mind.</v>

875
00:52:16.190 --> 00:52:18.530
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And also,</v>

876
00:52:19.580 --> 00:52:23.570
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>humans like to expand their niche,</v>

877
00:52:23.571 --> 00:52:25.100
<v Speaker 2>they like to explore.</v>

878
00:52:25.370 --> 00:52:30.370
<v Speaker 2>So it's a constant balance between what </v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm biologists would call exploitation </v>

879
00:52:31.580 --> 00:52:35.420
<v Speaker 2>and exploration.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Novelty is,</v>

880
00:52:35.600 --> 00:52:36.200
<v Speaker 2>is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

881
00:52:36.620 --> 00:52:41.620
<v Speaker 2>it's exciting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's actually an increase in </v>

882
00:52:41.620 --> 00:52:42.980
<v Speaker 2>norepinephrine and increase in arousal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It feels really exciting.</v>

883
00:52:43.440 --> 00:52:46.280
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's also super costly.</v>

884
00:52:46.580 --> 00:52:51.580
<v Speaker 2>Novelty requires usually that you learn </v>
<v Speaker 2>something new that means that's actually</v>

885
00:52:52.971 --> 00:52:54.890
<v Speaker 2>really metabolically expensive thing to </v>
<v Speaker 2>do.</v>

886
00:52:55.350 --> 00:53:00.350
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it also means usually that you're </v>

887
00:53:00.350 --> 00:53:02.411
<v Speaker 2>moving your body around,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is also metabolically expensive </v>

888
00:53:02.411 --> 00:53:05.381
<v Speaker 2>thing to do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the need for novelty is balanced by </v>

889
00:53:05.381 --> 00:53:07.310
<v Speaker 2>its cost.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And um,</v>

890
00:53:07.910 --> 00:53:12.530
<v Speaker 2>different nervous systems can bear ca </v>
<v Speaker 2>different amounts of cost.</v>

891
00:53:12.680 --> 00:53:17.680
<v Speaker 2>So for example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you take two rats that are somewhat </v>

892
00:53:18.051 --> 00:53:19.020
<v Speaker 2>genetically,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

893
00:53:19.090 --> 00:53:21.110
<v Speaker 2>model like they've been genetically </v>
<v Speaker 2>bred,</v>

894
00:53:21.350 --> 00:53:23.680
<v Speaker 2>one is bread.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When you stick it in a,</v>

895
00:53:25.560 --> 00:53:28.530
<v Speaker 2>a novel cage,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it just sits still.</v>

896
00:53:29.730 --> 00:53:31.980
<v Speaker 2>And the other one,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when you put it in all the cage,</v>

897
00:53:32.050 --> 00:53:34.560
<v Speaker 2>it roams all over the place and it's </v>
<v Speaker 2>just,</v>

898
00:53:34.590 --> 00:53:39.590
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's going crazy kind of exploring </v>

899
00:53:39.590 --> 00:53:39.590
<v Speaker 2>everything.</v>

900
00:53:39.590 --> 00:53:39.590
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the one that sits still,</v>

901
00:53:39.590 --> 00:53:40.320
<v Speaker 2>scientists might say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

902
00:53:40.321 --> 00:53:43.800
<v Speaker 2>that's a nervous rat or that rats </v>
<v Speaker 2>afraid.</v>

903
00:53:44.040 --> 00:53:49.040
<v Speaker 2>What does that read doing?</v>
<v Speaker 2>The Ra is not moving and it's not </v>

904
00:53:49.040 --> 00:53:50.690
<v Speaker 2>encoding anything because encoding,</v>
<v Speaker 2>coding something is expensive,</v>

905
00:53:50.691 --> 00:53:55.691
<v Speaker 2>it's expensive.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This rat on the other hand is roaming </v>

906
00:53:56.221 --> 00:53:58.140
<v Speaker 2>all over the place,</v>
<v Speaker 2>moving a lot,</v>

907
00:53:58.170 --> 00:54:00.300
<v Speaker 2>learning a lot,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so it's encoding a lot,</v>

908
00:54:00.301 --> 00:54:01.170
<v Speaker 2>spend,</v>
<v Speaker 2>spend,</v>

909
00:54:01.171 --> 00:54:02.280
<v Speaker 2>spend,</v>
<v Speaker 2>save,</v>

910
00:54:02.281 --> 00:54:03.030
<v Speaker 2>save,</v>
<v Speaker 2>save,</v>

911
00:54:03.031 --> 00:54:03.750
<v Speaker 2>spend,</v>
<v Speaker 2>spend,</v>

912
00:54:03.751 --> 00:54:07.350
<v Speaker 2>spend their time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There are differences between people and</v>

913
00:54:07.351 --> 00:54:12.351
<v Speaker 2>there are also differences between times</v>
<v Speaker 2>in your life where moments where you </v>

914
00:54:12.351 --> 00:54:15.471
<v Speaker 2>feel like you have a little bit to spend</v>
<v Speaker 2>and other moments where you feel like </v>

915
00:54:15.471 --> 00:54:15.720
<v Speaker 2>you really have to conserve.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When I talked to the public,</v>

916
00:54:15.721 --> 00:54:17.740
<v Speaker 2>I always talk about,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't use the word Alice status,</v>

917
00:54:17.760 --> 00:54:22.760
<v Speaker 2>it's just too boring a word,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I sort of do is sort of explain it </v>

918
00:54:22.760 --> 00:54:23.070
<v Speaker 2>like a budget.</v>

919
00:54:23.100 --> 00:54:28.100
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like your brain is sort of like the </v>

920
00:54:28.100 --> 00:54:29.790
<v Speaker 2>financial office of accompany.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Accompany has lots of offices.</v>

921
00:54:29.791 --> 00:54:34.020
<v Speaker 2>It has to balance the expenditures and </v>
<v Speaker 2>revenues and it's got to keep everything</v>

922
00:54:34.021 --> 00:54:39.021
<v Speaker 2>in balance so it might take a little </v>
<v Speaker 2>money here and move it over to that </v>

923
00:54:39.021 --> 00:54:39.021
<v Speaker 2>office.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

924
00:54:39.021 --> 00:54:39.620
<v Speaker 2>it's got to keep everything in balance.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What is always trying to do is,</v>

925
00:54:39.621 --> 00:54:41.880
<v Speaker 2>is spend a little bit to make a little </v>
<v Speaker 2>bit more,</v>

926
00:54:42.480 --> 00:54:43.110
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

927
00:54:43.210 --> 00:54:46.650
<v Speaker 2>what happens when it spends a little bit</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it doesn't get a revenue back,</v>

928
00:54:46.651 --> 00:54:49.110
<v Speaker 2>there's no reward.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What happens will it goes into the red a</v>

929
00:54:49.111 --> 00:54:54.111
<v Speaker 2>little bit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So what do you do when something goes </v>

930
00:54:54.111 --> 00:54:54.111
<v Speaker 2>into the red?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

931
00:54:54.111 --> 00:54:56.130
<v Speaker 2>you might do something risky.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You might actually spend a lot to try to</v>

932
00:54:56.160 --> 00:54:57.260
<v Speaker 2>really make,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

933
00:54:57.270 --> 00:54:59.760
<v Speaker 2>not just make back your deficit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but actually make a lot.</v>

934
00:55:00.030 --> 00:55:05.030
<v Speaker 2>That would be novelty,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that would be move and spent moving in </v>

935
00:55:05.030 --> 00:55:05.030
<v Speaker 2>code.</v>

936
00:55:05.030 --> 00:55:07.680
<v Speaker 2>Or you might reduce your spending.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You might say,</v>

937
00:55:07.681 --> 00:55:10.470
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to save a little bit now.</v>

938
00:55:10.860 --> 00:55:13.320
<v Speaker 2>That would be,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not going to move too much.</v>

939
00:55:13.740 --> 00:55:16.380
<v Speaker 2>I'm not gonna spend too much.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not going to code anything.</v>

940
00:55:16.920 --> 00:55:20.130
<v Speaker 2>So I certainly don't mean to suggest to </v>
<v Speaker 2>you that,</v>

941
00:55:20.190 --> 00:55:25.190
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that novelty is unimportant or that </v>

942
00:55:25.190 --> 00:55:25.190
<v Speaker 2>learning is unimportant.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

943
00:55:25.200 --> 00:55:27.780
<v Speaker 2>and it's a really important question </v>
<v Speaker 2>about,</v>

944
00:55:28.070 --> 00:55:33.070
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what is there any intrinsic value to a </v>

945
00:55:34.350 --> 00:55:36.760
<v Speaker 2>novelty over and above,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

946
00:55:36.810 --> 00:55:39.960
<v Speaker 2>the rewards that it would give you an </v>
<v Speaker 2>analysis static sense,</v>

947
00:55:40.440 --> 00:55:45.440
<v Speaker 2>but it is really clear to me that the </v>
<v Speaker 2>extent to which you,</v>

948
00:55:47.820 --> 00:55:52.820
<v Speaker 2>any nervous system will embrace novelty </v>
<v Speaker 2>and even seek it pretty much depends on </v>

949
00:55:53.970 --> 00:55:57.120
<v Speaker 2>the alis static state of that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of that system.</v>

950
00:55:57.270 --> 00:56:00.600
<v Speaker 2>If you don't have a lot to spend and </v>
<v Speaker 2>you're already in the red,</v>

951
00:56:01.560 --> 00:56:04.350
<v Speaker 2>if you at a certain point,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you continue to spend,</v>

952
00:56:04.351 --> 00:56:06.270
<v Speaker 2>when you're in the red,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you go bankrupt.</v>

953
00:56:06.570 --> 00:56:09.240
<v Speaker 2>What that means in human terms is you </v>
<v Speaker 2>get depressed.</v>

954
00:56:09.570 --> 00:56:14.570
<v Speaker 2>It means that your brain makes you </v>
<v Speaker 2>fatigued so you can't move and it makes </v>

955
00:56:14.570 --> 00:56:15.930
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>locks you in.</v>

956
00:56:15.931 --> 00:56:20.931
<v Speaker 2>So you stop paying attention to anything</v>
<v Speaker 2>going on around you in the world and </v>

957
00:56:20.931 --> 00:56:24.650
<v Speaker 2>your experiences.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just what's in your head that that's </v>

958
00:56:24.650 --> 00:56:24.650
<v Speaker 2>actually what depression is.</v>

959
00:56:26.670 --> 00:56:30.960
<v Speaker 3>It makes me think of Alice is more of as</v>
<v Speaker 3>a range than as a zero,</v>

960
00:56:31.550 --> 00:56:33.760
<v Speaker 2>not homeostasis.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's Alice thesis.</v>

961
00:56:33.820 --> 00:56:38.820
<v Speaker 2>It's arrange for sure where we.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll answer some other questions and </v>

962
00:56:38.820 --> 00:56:40.000
<v Speaker 2>maybe I'll get back to your first </v>
<v Speaker 2>question if there's time.</v>

963
00:56:41.950 --> 00:56:43.930
<v Speaker 3>So if I understand your argument </v>
<v Speaker 3>correctly,</v>

964
00:56:44.230 --> 00:56:47.500
<v Speaker 3>we're going to make anything like a </v>
<v Speaker 3>general intelligence,</v>

965
00:56:47.680 --> 00:56:49.670
<v Speaker 3>something approaching.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

966
00:56:49.690 --> 00:56:49.990
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

967
00:56:49.991 --> 00:56:51.190
<v Speaker 3>like a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a human.</v>

968
00:56:51.920 --> 00:56:55.630
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it needs to be an embodied system.</v>

969
00:56:55.730 --> 00:56:56.020
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

970
00:56:56.021 --> 00:56:58.760
<v Speaker 2>I want to be careful about saying that </v>
<v Speaker 2>because for two reasons.</v>

971
00:56:58.761 --> 00:57:01.760
<v Speaker 2>One,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because in biology there is this concept</v>

972
00:57:01.761 --> 00:57:04.340
<v Speaker 2>of degeneracy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is a sucky word,</v>

973
00:57:04.400 --> 00:57:08.690
<v Speaker 2>but it's a great concept and it means </v>
<v Speaker 2>that there's more than one way to skin a</v>

974
00:57:08.691 --> 00:57:09.560
<v Speaker 2>cat.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Basically,</v>

975
00:57:09.620 --> 00:57:14.620
<v Speaker 2>you want to functional outcome.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There are many ways to get to that </v>

976
00:57:14.620 --> 00:57:15.230
<v Speaker 2>functional outcome.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So genes for example,</v>

977
00:57:15.410 --> 00:57:20.410
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there are a lot of characteristics that </v>

978
00:57:20.410 --> 00:57:20.410
<v Speaker 2>are heritable,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but we don't know the genes for them.</v>

979
00:57:20.410 --> 00:57:22.490
<v Speaker 2>And the reason why is that there isn't </v>
<v Speaker 2>one set of genes,</v>

980
00:57:22.491 --> 00:57:27.491
<v Speaker 2>there are like multiple sets of genes </v>
<v Speaker 2>that can give you actually the same </v>

981
00:57:27.491 --> 00:57:30.641
<v Speaker 2>outcome.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So what I want to say is that you need </v>

982
00:57:30.641 --> 00:57:34.631
<v Speaker 2>something akin to a body.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't actually have to be a body.</v>

983
00:57:34.850 --> 00:57:39.080
<v Speaker 2>I imagine there are lots of ways that </v>
<v Speaker 2>you could implement a system.</v>

984
00:57:39.470 --> 00:57:44.470
<v Speaker 2>You can implement an agent that has </v>
<v Speaker 2>multiple systems of some sort that it </v>

985
00:57:44.470 --> 00:57:48.491
<v Speaker 2>has to manage,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but my point is that one thing about </v>

986
00:57:48.491 --> 00:57:51.500
<v Speaker 2>that is very important that we </v>
<v Speaker 2>continually miss.</v>

987
00:57:51.800 --> 00:57:54.890
<v Speaker 2>When we think about building an agent </v>
<v Speaker 2>with mental states.</v>

988
00:57:55.100 --> 00:58:00.100
<v Speaker 2>We continually miss the fact that it has</v>
<v Speaker 2>a body and as humans have bodies and </v>

989
00:58:00.561 --> 00:58:05.561
<v Speaker 2>that's the brain's primary task and our </v>
<v Speaker 2>most fundamental feelings come from the </v>

990
00:58:05.901 --> 00:58:10.670
<v Speaker 2>physical changes in our body.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Even though we don't normally experience</v>

991
00:58:10.671 --> 00:58:13.220
<v Speaker 2>it that way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That actually is how it is.</v>

992
00:58:13.221 --> 00:58:14.780
<v Speaker 2>If you just look at the wiring of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>brain,</v>

993
00:58:14.781 --> 00:58:19.781
<v Speaker 2>you can just see it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it seems to me that if you want to </v>

994
00:58:19.781 --> 00:58:23.111
<v Speaker 2>build an agent that is human,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like it has to have something like a </v>

995
00:58:23.111 --> 00:58:28.031
<v Speaker 2>body doesn't have to maybe be a body and</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm sure there are many clever ways that</v>

996
00:58:28.071 --> 00:58:32.720
<v Speaker 2>you could implement something like a </v>
<v Speaker 2>body without it actually being a body,</v>

997
00:58:32.721 --> 00:58:34.130
<v Speaker 2>if you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you understand what I mean.</v>

998
00:58:34.970 --> 00:58:39.970
<v Speaker 3>So Amazon,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Alexa couldn't be there if we just gave </v>

999
00:58:40.761 --> 00:58:45.761
<v Speaker 3>it some sort of representation of mental</v>
<v Speaker 3>states or some kind of alostatic target.</v>

1000
00:58:47.840 --> 00:58:48.360
<v Speaker 3>Sure.</v>

1001
00:58:51.160 --> 00:58:52.430
<v Speaker 2>Here's the.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let me just say one other thing.</v>

1002
00:58:52.470 --> 00:58:57.470
<v Speaker 2>I think it's really important.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All the brain requires is that you at </v>

1003
00:58:57.581 --> 00:58:59.830
<v Speaker 2>some point had a body.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You don't.</v>

1004
00:59:00.160 --> 00:59:05.160
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So basically being this is what phantom </v>

1005
00:59:05.160 --> 00:59:07.570
<v Speaker 2>limb pain is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is what chronic pain is,</v>

1006
00:59:07.571 --> 00:59:08.680
<v Speaker 2>this is what happened.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1007
00:59:08.920 --> 00:59:13.780
<v Speaker 2>if at some point you cease to get </v>
<v Speaker 2>information from your body anymore,</v>

1008
00:59:13.930 --> 00:59:18.930
<v Speaker 2>your brain still can simulate,</v>
<v Speaker 2>still can reinstate the sensory patterns</v>

1009
00:59:19.661 --> 00:59:23.660
<v Speaker 2>that once came from the.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's what's required,</v>

1010
00:59:24.260 --> 00:59:29.260
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>At some point the body isn't really </v>

1011
00:59:29.260 --> 00:59:29.260
<v Speaker 2>needed anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1012
00:59:30.320 --> 00:59:31.550
<v Speaker 2>I think we're here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1013
00:59:32.670 --> 00:59:36.160
<v Speaker 4>Emotions in humans are implemented by a </v>
<v Speaker 4>bunch of hacks,</v>

1014
00:59:36.170 --> 00:59:39.170
<v Speaker 4>so there's a bunch of chemicals that go </v>
<v Speaker 4>into your brain,</v>

1015
00:59:39.800 --> 00:59:42.770
<v Speaker 4>the oxytocin,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Serotonin,</v>

1016
00:59:43.800 --> 00:59:48.800
<v Speaker 4>a whole bunch of biochemical things that</v>
<v Speaker 4>diffused around in the fluids in your </v>

1017
00:59:48.800 --> 00:59:52.451
<v Speaker 4>brain that affects your emotional state,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and that seems like a hack that we've </v>

1018
00:59:52.451 --> 00:59:54.620
<v Speaker 4>inherited over millions of years from </v>
<v Speaker 4>premature ancestors.</v>

1019
00:59:55.000 --> 01:00:00.000
<v Speaker 4>I'm an.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If you look at the machine learning </v>

1020
01:00:00.000 --> 01:00:00.000
<v Speaker 4>world,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we can do a bunch of similar things with</v>

1021
01:00:00.000 --> 01:00:04.241
<v Speaker 4>neural net,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so you can increase the activation </v>

1022
01:00:04.241 --> 01:00:04.241
<v Speaker 4>threshold on a large scale.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

1023
01:00:04.241 --> 01:00:06.410
<v Speaker 4>change the map noise going into the </v>
<v Speaker 4>system.</v>

1024
01:00:06.590 --> 01:00:11.590
<v Speaker 4>You can do a bunch of similar things,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but you don't have to rely on fluids </v>

1025
01:00:11.590 --> 01:00:12.170
<v Speaker 4>being,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

1026
01:00:12.260 --> 01:00:15.140
<v Speaker 4>kind of cleaned slowly by glial cells.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

1027
01:00:15.170 --> 01:00:18.800
<v Speaker 4>things don't diffuse around in and </v>
<v Speaker 4>fluids in the system necessarily.</v>

1028
01:00:18.890 --> 01:00:20.840
<v Speaker 4>It seems like there's a lot more </v>
<v Speaker 4>flexibility.</v>

1029
01:00:21.860 --> 01:00:23.540
<v Speaker 4>So when you come to an implementation,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's not many,</v>

1030
01:00:23.570 --> 01:00:28.280
<v Speaker 4>so many constraints imposed by the </v>
<v Speaker 4>evolutionary history on the whole system</v>

1031
01:00:28.490 --> 01:00:30.230
<v Speaker 4>and it seems like that would make it </v>
<v Speaker 4>work better.</v>

1032
01:00:30.231 --> 01:00:32.690
<v Speaker 4>So when people are in negative emotional</v>
<v Speaker 4>states,</v>

1033
01:00:32.860 --> 01:00:34.130
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they can't think straight,</v>

1034
01:00:35.210 --> 01:00:38.000
<v Speaker 4>not true.</v>
<v Speaker 4>People can think actually quite well and</v>

1035
01:00:38.001 --> 01:00:39.600
<v Speaker 4>negative emotional states.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I haven't tell you.</v>

1036
01:00:39.990 --> 01:00:41.280
<v Speaker 4>So emotion,</v>

1037
01:00:42.660 --> 01:00:45.770
<v Speaker 2>they can do very nefarious things very,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very effectively.</v>

1038
01:00:45.860 --> 01:00:48.620
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>So the general point I think is true,</v>

1039
01:00:48.680 --> 01:00:51.290
<v Speaker 4>even if the example is not so,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

1040
01:00:51.920 --> 01:00:55.910
<v Speaker 4>emotions kind of flood your nervous </v>
<v Speaker 4>system with emotions don't flood,</v>

1041
01:00:55.911 --> 01:00:57.920
<v Speaker 4>you're nervous.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Some of them do.</v>

1042
01:00:58.770 --> 01:01:03.770
<v Speaker 4>So here's the thing in your bloodstream </v>
<v Speaker 4>stream,</v>

1043
01:01:06.280 --> 01:01:08.360
<v Speaker 4>let's talk about this chemicals.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There was not a single camera</v>

1044
01:01:08.410 --> 01:01:12.310
<v Speaker 2>well in your brain or anywhere in your </v>
<v Speaker 2>nervous system that is for emotion.</v>

1045
01:01:12.910 --> 01:01:16.000
<v Speaker 2>Serotonin is not for emotion domain,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not promotion.</v>

1046
01:01:16.080 --> 01:01:19.540
<v Speaker 2>Oxy chosen is not for emotion,</v>
<v Speaker 2>even opioid,</v>

1047
01:01:19.541 --> 01:01:24.541
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>even even even opioids are not for </v>

1048
01:01:24.541 --> 01:01:24.541
<v Speaker 2>emotion.</v>

1049
01:01:24.541 --> 01:01:25.120
<v Speaker 4>So they influenced your emotions,</v>
<v Speaker 4>very involved,</v>

1050
01:01:25.320 --> 01:01:25.850
<v Speaker 4>influenced</v>

1051
01:01:26.050 --> 01:01:30.370
<v Speaker 2>every mental event that you have,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not just emotion,</v>

1052
01:01:30.620 --> 01:01:32.710
<v Speaker 2>so your brain,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for example,</v>

1053
01:01:32.770 --> 01:01:37.770
<v Speaker 2>your brain is a physical.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a set of physical cells that are </v>

1054
01:01:38.471 --> 01:01:43.471
<v Speaker 2>bathed in neurochemical systems and the </v>
<v Speaker 2>neurochemical systems that you're </v>

1055
01:01:43.471 --> 01:01:47.401
<v Speaker 2>referring to basically change the ease </v>
<v Speaker 2>with which information is passed back </v>

1056
01:01:47.401 --> 01:01:50.290
<v Speaker 2>and forth between those neurons.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's always true.</v>

1057
01:01:50.620 --> 01:01:55.620
<v Speaker 2>It's true.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Regardless of whether the event is </v>

1058
01:01:55.620 --> 01:01:57.730
<v Speaker 2>emotion or whether it's a perception or </v>
<v Speaker 2>whether it's a thought or whether it's a</v>

1059
01:01:57.731 --> 01:02:00.040
<v Speaker 2>belief,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's always true.</v>

1060
01:02:00.220 --> 01:02:02.230
<v Speaker 2>So for example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>serotonin.</v>

1061
01:02:02.650 --> 01:02:07.650
<v Speaker 2>Serotonin is a neurotransmitter that </v>
<v Speaker 2>allows your brain to delay gratification</v>

1062
01:02:09.401 --> 01:02:14.401
<v Speaker 2>of a reward.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It allows you to expend energy now </v>

1063
01:02:14.401 --> 01:02:17.620
<v Speaker 2>because you anticipate a reward at some </v>
<v Speaker 2>point in the future,</v>

1064
01:02:18.100 --> 01:02:22.740
<v Speaker 2>and if you have a deficit in Serotonin,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then you can't do that very well.</v>

1065
01:02:22.800 --> 01:02:27.800
<v Speaker 2>And it turns out for humans,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one of our great superpowers is the </v>

1066
01:02:27.800 --> 01:02:31.461
<v Speaker 2>ability to do mental time travel,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to remember in the past,</v>

1067
01:02:31.621 --> 01:02:36.621
<v Speaker 2>and also to do things now because we </v>
<v Speaker 2>know they're gonna have an effect 10 or </v>

1068
01:02:36.621 --> 01:02:38.250
<v Speaker 2>20 or 50 or 100 years from now.</v>

1069
01:02:38.910 --> 01:02:40.420
<v Speaker 2>So the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

1070
01:02:40.910 --> 01:02:45.910
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in when I said you have to have </v>

1071
01:02:45.910 --> 01:02:47.481
<v Speaker 2>something like a body.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not saying literally you have to </v>

1072
01:02:47.481 --> 01:02:48.810
<v Speaker 2>have a physical corporeal body.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm saying you have to have.</v>

1073
01:02:49.710 --> 01:02:51.360
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's just a fact.</v>

1074
01:02:51.361 --> 01:02:54.720
<v Speaker 2>It's not an argument.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a fact that your brain,</v>

1075
01:02:54.721 --> 01:02:59.550
<v Speaker 2>that brains evolved for the purposes of </v>
<v Speaker 2>regulating multiple systems.</v>

1076
01:03:00.050 --> 01:03:02.610
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and from a cybernetic standpoint,</v>

1077
01:03:03.000 --> 01:03:08.000
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the best way to regulate a system is to </v>

1078
01:03:08.000 --> 01:03:08.000
<v Speaker 2>build an internal model of it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's what your brain is.</v>

1079
01:03:08.000 --> 01:03:10.560
<v Speaker 2>Your brain is an internal model of your </v>
<v Speaker 2>body in the world.</v>

1080
01:03:10.590 --> 01:03:13.410
<v Speaker 2>It's running simulations,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's running this model.</v>

1081
01:03:13.590 --> 01:03:18.590
<v Speaker 2>And if you want to have an agent that is</v>
<v Speaker 2>somewhat humanlike that has feelings </v>

1082
01:03:18.590 --> 01:03:21.240
<v Speaker 2>like humans,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then they have to do something that they</v>

1083
01:03:21.241 --> 01:03:26.241
<v Speaker 2>have to have to be able to do something </v>
<v Speaker 2>similar and whether it's a actual </v>

1084
01:03:26.241 --> 01:03:27.840
<v Speaker 2>physical corporeal body or not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think is,</v>

1085
01:03:28.170 --> 01:03:29.570
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's an open question.</v>

1086
01:03:31.590 --> 01:03:36.590
<v Speaker 4>Premises before I've got to my question.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So I started off by saying I started off</v>

1087
01:03:36.971 --> 01:03:40.060
<v Speaker 4>by saying emotions are implemented as a </v>
<v Speaker 4>bunch of hacks.</v>

1088
01:03:40.150 --> 01:03:45.150
<v Speaker 4>So would you say broadly correct?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Or would you say that they're not hacks,</v>

1089
01:03:45.371 --> 01:03:48.050
<v Speaker 4>they're finely tuned and adaptive and.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

1090
01:03:48.280 --> 01:03:51.440
<v Speaker 4>I wouldn't say not maladaptive,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but would you say it's a bunch of hacks?</v>

1091
01:03:52.460 --> 01:03:53.780
<v Speaker 2>I don't know what you mean by hacks</v>

1092
01:03:55.120 --> 01:03:57.690
<v Speaker 4>is kind of historical accident.</v>

1093
01:03:58.900 --> 01:04:03.900
<v Speaker 2>You're talking about emotions like </v>
<v Speaker 2>they're talking the premise of your </v>

1094
01:04:03.900 --> 01:04:08.271
<v Speaker 2>question.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can't answer your question because I </v>

1095
01:04:08.271 --> 01:04:08.271
<v Speaker 2>think it's not the correct question.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1096
01:04:08.490 --> 01:04:12.360
<v Speaker 2>it's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Emotions aren't like blood pressure,</v>

1097
01:04:12.540 --> 01:04:15.240
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they don't exist in that sense.</v>

1098
01:04:15.870 --> 01:04:17.040
<v Speaker 2>They are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1099
01:04:18.080 --> 01:04:21.620
<v Speaker 2>they are the way that they are.</v>
<v Speaker 2>First of all,</v>

1100
01:04:21.621 --> 01:04:26.621
<v Speaker 2>not all cultures have.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Not all people in all cultures have </v>

1101
01:04:27.081 --> 01:04:29.690
<v Speaker 2>emotions.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Everybody has an effect.</v>

1102
01:04:29.870 --> 01:04:32.330
<v Speaker 2>Assuming they have a neurotypical brain </v>
<v Speaker 2>of sorts,</v>

1103
01:04:32.660 --> 01:04:35.840
<v Speaker 2>but um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they don't all have emotion.</v>

1104
01:04:36.050 --> 01:04:41.050
<v Speaker 2>And so to answer your question that your</v>
<v Speaker 2>answer asking me is I can't answer it </v>

1105
01:04:41.211 --> 01:04:42.900
<v Speaker 2>because I don't think it's the right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think so.</v>

1106
01:04:43.090 --> 01:04:48.090
<v Speaker 4>The right question.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The pain systems seem like things that </v>

1107
01:04:50.070 --> 01:04:53.830
<v Speaker 4>influence your emotions fairly directly.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So this is not the same thing,</v>

1108
01:04:53.950 --> 01:04:55.210
<v Speaker 4>but it's a powerful link.</v>

1109
01:04:56.560 --> 01:05:01.560
<v Speaker 2>Opioids though.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So opioids are important for instances </v>

1110
01:05:02.711 --> 01:05:07.711
<v Speaker 2>of emotion,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they are also important for every </v>

1111
01:05:07.711 --> 01:05:11.220
<v Speaker 2>other category of mental event that you </v>
<v Speaker 2>brand can make a lot of other things </v>

1112
01:05:11.220 --> 01:05:11.740
<v Speaker 2>too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I agree.</v>

1113
01:05:12.270 --> 01:05:13.810
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I,</v>

1114
01:05:14.340 --> 01:05:15.250
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1115
01:05:15.510 --> 01:05:19.590
<v Speaker 2>but you will see sometimes will assign,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1116
01:05:19.630 --> 01:05:24.630
<v Speaker 2>I'm an emotional meaning to something </v>
<v Speaker 2>like dopamine is for first hedonic </v>

1117
01:05:25.391 --> 01:05:30.391
<v Speaker 2>pleasantness and then it's for reward.</v>
<v Speaker 2>People like to assign single functions </v>

1118
01:05:30.391 --> 01:05:35.310
<v Speaker 2>to biological entities like a chemical </v>
<v Speaker 2>or a brain region,</v>

1119
01:05:35.741 --> 01:05:39.790
<v Speaker 2>a cluster of neurons or it's just not.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's really.</v>

1120
01:05:39.880 --> 01:05:43.060
<v Speaker 2>I'm not saying every chemical does </v>
<v Speaker 2>everything but whatever.</v>

1121
01:05:43.061 --> 01:05:48.061
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Whatever opioids do they do in every </v>

1122
01:05:48.061 --> 01:05:51.531
<v Speaker 2>waking moment of your life,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not just in moments that are emotional </v>

1123
01:05:51.751 --> 01:05:52.170
<v Speaker 2>for you.</v>

1124
01:05:52.310 --> 01:05:53.100
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I should stop now.</v>

1125
01:05:53.160 --> 01:05:57.150
<v Speaker 5>I'm thinking.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

1126
01:05:58.380 --> 01:06:03.380
<v Speaker 5>I figure it was very interesting that </v>
<v Speaker 5>you brought up the last topic of love </v>

1127
01:06:03.380 --> 01:06:05.910
<v Speaker 5>because I think it actually brings up a </v>
<v Speaker 5>really important thing which is,</v>

1128
01:06:06.190 --> 01:06:08.310
<v Speaker 5>and what you were saying about </v>
<v Speaker 5>connection,</v>

1129
01:06:09.960 --> 01:06:13.620
<v Speaker 5>that's the primary purpose of life is to</v>
<v Speaker 5>procreate,</v>

1130
01:06:14.130 --> 01:06:15.000
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean that,</v>

1131
01:06:15.310 --> 01:06:18.270
<v Speaker 5>that's what our deans do.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So first of all,</v>

1132
01:06:18.271 --> 01:06:21.250
<v Speaker 5>right,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm not going to be touching that.</v>

1133
01:06:23.890 --> 01:06:28.890
<v Speaker 5>I'm so that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And of course in humans it's not just </v>

1134
01:06:31.890 --> 01:06:33.150
<v Speaker 5>genetic,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's mimetic.</v>

1135
01:06:33.151 --> 01:06:38.151
<v Speaker 5>I mean we,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we procreate our ideas as well as </v>

1136
01:06:38.151 --> 01:06:42.380
<v Speaker 5>physically and so a primary purpose of </v>
<v Speaker 5>our winning our,</v>

1137
01:06:44.070 --> 01:06:49.070
<v Speaker 5>our reactions and interactions with </v>
<v Speaker 5>other people and other things is that </v>

1138
01:06:51.961 --> 01:06:56.961
<v Speaker 5>goal is that we get rewarded when we </v>
<v Speaker 5>interact with other things in a way that</v>

1139
01:06:58.050 --> 01:07:01.920
<v Speaker 5>creates something new,</v>
<v Speaker 5>whether it's art or you know,</v>

1140
01:07:02.100 --> 01:07:04.560
<v Speaker 5>a book or technology or something like </v>
<v Speaker 5>that.</v>

1141
01:07:04.920 --> 01:07:09.920
<v Speaker 5>And if we don't put that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>if there's no inherent reason for a </v>

1142
01:07:11.461 --> 01:07:15.000
<v Speaker 5>robot or a computer system to want to do</v>
<v Speaker 5>that,</v>

1143
01:07:15.001 --> 01:07:15.620
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 5>how do,</v>

1144
01:07:16.080 --> 01:07:21.080
<v Speaker 5>how could we can even imagine putting </v>
<v Speaker 5>that into a system inherently that it </v>

1145
01:07:24.270 --> 01:07:29.270
<v Speaker 5>wants to,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that it just desperately wants to make </v>

1146
01:07:29.270 --> 01:07:30.890
<v Speaker 5>something new.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

1147
01:07:31.210 --> 01:07:32.200
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>here's what I would say,</v>

1148
01:07:32.201 --> 01:07:32.990
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when we're,</v>

1149
01:07:33.200 --> 01:07:34.000
<v Speaker 2>when,</v>
<v Speaker 2>first of all,</v>

1150
01:07:34.030 --> 01:07:38.320
<v Speaker 2>when we talk about,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we've been focusing a lot on bodies.</v>

1151
01:07:38.321 --> 01:07:40.330
<v Speaker 2>I'm certainly not saying that's a </v>
<v Speaker 2>sufficient condition,</v>

1152
01:07:40.331 --> 01:07:45.331
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm just saying it's a necessary one or </v>

1153
01:07:45.331 --> 01:07:47.551
<v Speaker 2>something like a body.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I certainly have the motivation to </v>

1154
01:07:47.551 --> 01:07:50.200
<v Speaker 2>create.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I'm imagining that you do too.</v>

1155
01:07:50.260 --> 01:07:52.240
<v Speaker 2>I have to tell you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not everybody has that.</v>

1156
01:07:53.730 --> 01:07:57.300
<v Speaker 2>Most adolescents don't have that many </v>
<v Speaker 2>adolescents don't have it.</v>

1157
01:07:57.301 --> 01:07:58.410
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That was a joke.</v>

1158
01:07:58.500 --> 01:08:00.990
<v Speaker 2>I have a teenage daughter just telling </v>
<v Speaker 2>you.</v>

1159
01:08:02.480 --> 01:08:03.950
<v Speaker 2>But the point is that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1160
01:08:04.290 --> 01:08:09.290
<v Speaker 2>that what people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what people find rewarding is remarkably</v>

1161
01:08:10.051 --> 01:08:15.051
<v Speaker 2>diverse.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But the property I think is that there </v>

1162
01:08:16.731 --> 01:08:21.170
<v Speaker 2>has to be a feature of reward for,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for a lot of people,</v>

1163
01:08:21.171 --> 01:08:21.870
<v Speaker 2>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1164
01:08:22.040 --> 01:08:27.040
<v Speaker 2>that's having an impact in some way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm having an impact on another person </v>

1165
01:08:27.040 --> 01:08:28.360
<v Speaker 2>having an impact,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1166
01:08:28.490 --> 01:08:31.880
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>on a building,</v>

1167
01:08:31.881 --> 01:08:33.560
<v Speaker 2>something that wasn't there before,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever,</v>

1168
01:08:33.561 --> 01:08:34.030
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in,</v>

1169
01:08:34.060 --> 01:08:39.060
<v Speaker 2>in innovating or I'm discovering,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's not true for everybody.</v>

1170
01:08:39.290 --> 01:08:43.640
<v Speaker 2>It's just true for a lot of people in </v>
<v Speaker 2>this room probably.</v>

1171
01:08:43.820 --> 01:08:46.130
<v Speaker 2>And certainly the people that we </v>
<v Speaker 2>probably spend a lot of time with,</v>

1172
01:08:46.131 --> 01:08:47.600
<v Speaker 2>but not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not for everybody.</v>

1173
01:08:47.601 --> 01:08:50.210
<v Speaker 2>There's also the genetic part.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sure.</v>

1174
01:08:50.211 --> 01:08:50.930
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>

1175
01:08:50.960 --> 01:08:52.090
<v Speaker 2>but if you want to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1176
01:08:52.190 --> 01:08:53.140
<v Speaker 2>if you want to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1177
01:08:53.141 --> 01:08:53.740
<v Speaker 2>if you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1178
01:08:53.750 --> 01:08:56.300
<v Speaker 2>we can certainly make a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a genetic argument here.</v>

1179
01:08:56.301 --> 01:08:59.060
<v Speaker 2>Absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're there.</v>

1180
01:09:00.890 --> 01:09:05.890
<v Speaker 2>The,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's nothing that I've said today </v>

1181
01:09:05.890 --> 01:09:08.510
<v Speaker 2>that is inconsistent with the idea that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1182
01:09:08.810 --> 01:09:13.810
<v Speaker 2>that you have,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that you have to pass your genes onto </v>

1183
01:09:13.810 --> 01:09:16.120
<v Speaker 2>the next generation and actually make </v>
<v Speaker 2>sure that that generation survives to </v>

1184
01:09:16.120 --> 01:09:19.940
<v Speaker 2>reproductive age.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not just enough to have offspring.</v>

1185
01:09:19.941 --> 01:09:23.660
<v Speaker 2>You have to make sure that the offspring</v>
<v Speaker 2>survive to reproductive age.</v>

1186
01:09:23.990 --> 01:09:28.990
<v Speaker 2>And there's a whole argument about,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1187
01:09:31.250 --> 01:09:33.380
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

1188
01:09:35.300 --> 01:09:37.850
<v Speaker 2>the learning of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1189
01:09:39.530 --> 01:09:44.530
<v Speaker 2>social reality,</v>
<v Speaker 2>concepts of social reality that we've </v>

1190
01:09:44.530 --> 01:09:44.870
<v Speaker 2>been talking about,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like money and emotions and so on.</v>

1191
01:09:46.160 --> 01:09:47.810
<v Speaker 2>That makes that argument,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right,</v>

1192
01:09:47.840 --> 01:09:52.840
<v Speaker 2>that it's very expensive to have to </v>
<v Speaker 2>encode everything in jeans or to have to</v>

1193
01:09:53.750 --> 01:09:56.690
<v Speaker 2>learn everything from scratch,</v>
<v Speaker 2>every generation.</v>

1194
01:09:56.930 --> 01:10:01.930
<v Speaker 2>So instead what we have is a system,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a genetic system that allows us to wire </v>

1195
01:10:02.181 --> 01:10:03.970
<v Speaker 2>the brains of the young,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1196
01:10:04.070 --> 01:10:07.760
<v Speaker 2>with what we know and that's what we do </v>
<v Speaker 2>basically.</v>

1197
01:10:08.340 --> 01:10:12.160
<v Speaker 6>Alright.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So it's the.</v>

1198
01:10:13.020 --> 01:10:18.020
<v Speaker 6>I'm curious about your analogy about </v>
<v Speaker 6>intentionality that you talked about </v>

1199
01:10:18.020 --> 01:10:22.581
<v Speaker 6>when you use the analogy between money </v>
<v Speaker 6>and the perception of read to the facts </v>

1200
01:10:23.401 --> 01:10:28.401
<v Speaker 6>that we,</v>
<v Speaker 6>the fact that we have emotion because </v>

1201
01:10:28.401 --> 01:10:32.270
<v Speaker 6>the distinguishing feature,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it seems to me is the level of </v>

1202
01:10:32.270 --> 01:10:32.700
<v Speaker 6>intentionality.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And as you said before,</v>

1203
01:10:32.940 --> 01:10:36.570
<v Speaker 6>our brain assigns meaning to things but </v>
<v Speaker 6>we don't or maybe.</v>

1204
01:10:36.620 --> 01:10:39.600
<v Speaker 6>And my question is whether or not you </v>
<v Speaker 6>agree with this.</v>

1205
01:10:39.601 --> 01:10:42.150
<v Speaker 6>I guess we don't always deliberately </v>
<v Speaker 6>assigned.</v>

1206
01:10:42.320 --> 01:10:47.320
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is nothing I've said is about ever </v>

1207
01:10:47.320 --> 01:10:47.320
<v Speaker 2>delivered.</v>

1208
01:10:47.320 --> 01:10:48.310
<v Speaker 6>But sometimes we do sometimes quite </v>
<v Speaker 6>often actually.</v>

1209
01:10:48.340 --> 01:10:50.980
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So when you go back to like the question</v>

1210
01:10:50.981 --> 01:10:54.910
<v Speaker 6>of what makes something intelligent,</v>
<v Speaker 6>a lot of previous talks have been about,</v>

1211
01:10:55.060 --> 01:11:00.060
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>we want to pick a goal and then we </v>

1212
01:11:00.060 --> 01:11:03.010
<v Speaker 6>create costs to achieve that goal,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but that goal is deliberately assigned.</v>

1213
01:11:03.460 --> 01:11:06.970
<v Speaker 6>So when you talk about like what makes </v>
<v Speaker 6>something intelligent,</v>

1214
01:11:08.080 --> 01:11:12.340
<v Speaker 6>what do you think the role of </v>
<v Speaker 6>intentionality is and the spectrum there</v>

1215
01:11:12.341 --> 01:11:13.590
<v Speaker 6>in?</v>
<v Speaker 6>So first of all,</v>

1216
01:11:13.591 --> 01:11:14.040
<v Speaker 6>we talk about</v>

1217
01:11:14.040 --> 01:11:19.040
<v Speaker 2>intentionality.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think you have to really be careful </v>

1218
01:11:19.040 --> 01:11:21.261
<v Speaker 2>that you are.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Philosophers talk about intentionality </v>

1219
01:11:21.261 --> 01:11:21.990
<v Speaker 2>in two ways.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They talk about intentionality to mean a</v>

1220
01:11:21.991 --> 01:11:26.991
<v Speaker 2>deliberate action the way you mean it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but intentionality can also mean that </v>

1221
01:11:26.991 --> 01:11:29.640
<v Speaker 2>something has a reference out in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>real world outside of you.</v>

1222
01:11:29.940 --> 01:11:31.140
<v Speaker 2>Really.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that a word,</v>

1223
01:11:31.160 --> 01:11:33.960
<v Speaker 2>a word has a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a reference that's the,</v>

1224
01:11:33.961 --> 01:11:34.830
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1225
01:11:34.860 --> 01:11:37.410
<v Speaker 2>the intention of the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of the word basically.</v>

1226
01:11:37.610 --> 01:11:38.970
<v Speaker 2>So I think you have to be really </v>
<v Speaker 2>careful.</v>

1227
01:11:39.150 --> 01:11:42.450
<v Speaker 2>I also think that you have to make a </v>
<v Speaker 2>distinction between a conscious,</v>

1228
01:11:42.600 --> 01:11:47.600
<v Speaker 2>deliberate,</v>
<v Speaker 2>explicitly a goal that you can </v>

1229
01:11:48.931 --> 01:11:53.931
<v Speaker 2>explicitly describe.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I'm a,</v>

1230
01:11:56.990 --> 01:11:57.480
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're,</v>

1231
01:11:57.540 --> 01:12:00.180
<v Speaker 2>you're sort of making your,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sort of,</v>

1232
01:12:00.181 --> 01:12:05.181
<v Speaker 2>making the kind of question you're </v>
<v Speaker 2>asking is getting very close to the </v>

1233
01:12:05.181 --> 01:12:07.050
<v Speaker 2>question of freewill.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Joe would love to not have to discuss,</v>

1234
01:12:07.440 --> 01:12:12.440
<v Speaker 2>but um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but basically what I'm about to say is </v>

1235
01:12:12.440 --> 01:12:14.220
<v Speaker 2>gonna sound very Cartesian,</v>
<v Speaker 2>unfortunately,</v>

1236
01:12:14.221 --> 01:12:15.660
<v Speaker 2>because that's English.</v>

1237
01:12:15.720 --> 01:12:18.090
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's no other way to do it actually.</v>

1238
01:12:18.360 --> 01:12:22.110
<v Speaker 2>But what I want to say is that your </v>
<v Speaker 2>brain is always,</v>

1239
01:12:22.440 --> 01:12:23.730
<v Speaker 2>there's always,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1240
01:12:24.120 --> 01:12:29.120
<v Speaker 2>volition,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's not always consciously </v>

1241
01:12:29.120 --> 01:12:30.000
<v Speaker 2>experienced by you as,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as agency or will.</v>

1242
01:12:30.420 --> 01:12:33.520
<v Speaker 2>So you're not a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're not a,</v>

1243
01:12:33.630 --> 01:12:35.010
<v Speaker 2>a sea urchin.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1244
01:12:35.070 --> 01:12:38.790
<v Speaker 2>your sensory neurons are not hardwired </v>
<v Speaker 2>to your motor neurons.</v>

1245
01:12:39.030 --> 01:12:41.790
<v Speaker 2>You have interneurons.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That means you have choice.</v>

1246
01:12:41.791 --> 01:12:44.730
<v Speaker 2>Do you consciously experienced yourself </v>
<v Speaker 2>as making choices all the time?</v>

1247
01:12:44.731 --> 01:12:45.510
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you don't,</v>

1248
01:12:45.511 --> 01:12:48.720
<v Speaker 2>but your brain is actually making </v>
<v Speaker 2>choices all the time.</v>

1249
01:12:48.990 --> 01:12:51.270
<v Speaker 2>That's why people who study decision </v>
<v Speaker 2>making,</v>

1250
01:12:51.520 --> 01:12:56.520
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>think they're studying the whole brain </v>

1251
01:12:56.520 --> 01:12:56.520
<v Speaker 2>because they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they are actually.</v>

1252
01:12:56.520 --> 01:12:59.880
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I think you have to be really careful</v>

1253
01:12:59.970 --> 01:13:04.970
<v Speaker 2>about.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There are words that we use in English </v>

1254
01:13:04.970 --> 01:13:09.320
<v Speaker 2>and in science that have two meanings.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They can have a meaning that is about </v>

1255
01:13:10.201 --> 01:13:15.201
<v Speaker 2>decision making or choice that is just </v>
<v Speaker 2>obligatory automatic and a function of </v>

1256
01:13:16.021 --> 01:13:20.580
<v Speaker 2>how the system works and then there's </v>
<v Speaker 2>the kind of choice that feels deliberate</v>

1257
01:13:20.581 --> 01:13:24.960
<v Speaker 2>and effortful and where we feel like </v>
<v Speaker 2>we're the agents we experience ourselves</v>

1258
01:13:24.961 --> 01:13:25.940
<v Speaker 2>as the agents.</v>

1259
01:13:26.130 --> 01:13:29.190
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and intentionality.</v>

1260
01:13:29.460 --> 01:13:32.400
<v Speaker 2>I'm usually can be assigned to the </v>
<v Speaker 2>second one,</v>

1261
01:13:32.401 --> 01:13:34.680
<v Speaker 2>but actually in truth,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in philosophical terms,</v>

1262
01:13:34.681 --> 01:13:37.590
<v Speaker 2>it can also be assigned to the first </v>
<v Speaker 2>that when you,</v>

1263
01:13:37.620 --> 01:13:42.620
<v Speaker 2>even,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you're completely unaware of having </v>

1264
01:13:42.620 --> 01:13:45.861
<v Speaker 2>made a choice,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're acting on something with some </v>

1265
01:13:45.861 --> 01:13:47.960
<v Speaker 2>degree of volition because you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>

1266
01:13:48.060 --> 01:13:51.810
<v Speaker 2>it's not a reflex.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not like somebody hit your patellar</v>

1267
01:13:51.840 --> 01:13:53.160
<v Speaker 2>tendon,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a new kit.</v>

1268
01:13:53.340 --> 01:13:55.170
<v Speaker 2>And so it's really interesting that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

1269
01:13:55.410 --> 01:13:56.580
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think you just have to,</v>

1270
01:13:56.640 --> 01:13:59.490
<v Speaker 2>you have to make that distinction and I </v>
<v Speaker 2>probably should get to the next question</v>

1271
01:13:59.491 --> 01:14:00.890
<v Speaker 2>we can follow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1272
01:14:01.430 --> 01:14:01.830
<v Speaker 2>Yep.</v>

1273
01:14:02.450 --> 01:14:07.450
<v Speaker 6>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>so you've been asked a lot of esoteric </v>

1274
01:14:07.450 --> 01:14:09.631
<v Speaker 6>questions about ai,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but I think we might gain some insights </v>

1275
01:14:09.631 --> 01:14:11.740
<v Speaker 6>by wondering about Dei.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That is a dog intelligence.</v>

1276
01:14:13.180 --> 01:14:18.180
<v Speaker 6>So I believe I,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I sort of understand what my dog is </v>

1277
01:14:18.180 --> 01:14:20.830
<v Speaker 6>feeling and I,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I usually believe that,</v>

1278
01:14:20.860 --> 01:14:22.090
<v Speaker 6>um,</v>
<v Speaker 6>my dog,</v>

1279
01:14:22.240 --> 01:14:23.710
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>believes the same,</v>

1280
01:14:24.300 --> 01:14:26.410
<v Speaker 6>um,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but not the same with,</v>

1281
01:14:26.430 --> 01:14:29.410
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>a cat and you're not a cat person.</v>

1282
01:14:30.200 --> 01:14:32.100
<v Speaker 6>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Um,</v>

1283
01:14:32.160 --> 01:14:33.040
<v Speaker 6>and,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

1284
01:14:33.110 --> 01:14:35.620
<v Speaker 6>I'm not,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I don't know that much about monkeys,</v>

1285
01:14:35.930 --> 01:14:39.400
<v Speaker 6>but I've never really seen a monkey be </v>
<v Speaker 6>able to make the expressions that are,</v>

1286
01:14:39.490 --> 01:14:41.400
<v Speaker 6>let's say a dog can.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Um,</v>

1287
01:14:42.040 --> 01:14:47.040
<v Speaker 6>and I was wondering if you had any </v>
<v Speaker 6>insights about why dogs are able to do </v>

1288
01:14:47.040 --> 01:14:50.500
<v Speaker 6>this and why we're able to read dogs.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Is it something just simple,</v>

1289
01:14:50.501 --> 01:14:53.470
<v Speaker 6>like they're,</v>
<v Speaker 6>they have the right facial muscles or is</v>

1290
01:14:53.471 --> 01:14:58.471
<v Speaker 6>it something,</v>
<v Speaker 6>some drive that allows them to learn </v>

1291
01:14:58.471 --> 01:14:58.471
<v Speaker 6>this?</v>

1292
01:14:58.471 --> 01:15:02.090
<v Speaker 2>So I think before I wrote my book,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would have answered this question </v>

1293
01:15:02.090 --> 01:15:02.190
<v Speaker 2>differently.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1294
01:15:02.910 --> 01:15:04.860
<v Speaker 2>but now here's what I would say.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think,</v>

1295
01:15:04.870 --> 01:15:06.660
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1296
01:15:06.990 --> 01:15:10.350
<v Speaker 2>many creatures on this planet have an </v>
<v Speaker 2>effect,</v>

1297
01:15:11.320 --> 01:15:14.940
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And we can debate about whether,</v>

1298
01:15:14.941 --> 01:15:16.560
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just came across a paper the other day</v>

1299
01:15:16.561 --> 01:15:17.880
<v Speaker 2>about whether fly,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1300
01:15:17.900 --> 01:15:21.070
<v Speaker 2>just her Sophala have an have an effect </v>
<v Speaker 2>and you know,</v>

1301
01:15:21.100 --> 01:15:26.100
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's actually a really interesting </v>

1302
01:15:26.100 --> 01:15:26.100
<v Speaker 2>question.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They certainly,</v>

1303
01:15:26.100 --> 01:15:26.100
<v Speaker 2>they have something like opioids and </v>
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>

1304
01:15:26.100 --> 01:15:30.950
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so it's essentially a question but dogs </v>

1305
01:15:31.050 --> 01:15:36.050
<v Speaker 2>dogs are really interesting because they</v>
<v Speaker 2>do seem to have some capacities that </v>

1306
01:15:38.250 --> 01:15:43.250
<v Speaker 2>only that you only see in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in great apes and they may have </v>

1307
01:15:44.281 --> 01:15:47.430
<v Speaker 2>capacities that great apes even other </v>
<v Speaker 2>than us don't have.</v>

1308
01:15:48.330 --> 01:15:53.330
<v Speaker 2>And I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so they certainly have some capacities </v>

1309
01:15:53.330 --> 01:15:53.330
<v Speaker 2>we don't have either,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but.</v>

1310
01:15:53.330 --> 01:15:54.240
<v Speaker 2>But here's my point.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We actually bred them.</v>

1311
01:15:55.230 --> 01:16:00.230
<v Speaker 2>We bred these animals,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we selected them basically not natural </v>

1312
01:16:00.230 --> 01:16:00.660
<v Speaker 2>selection.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>

1313
01:16:01.100 --> 01:16:06.100
<v Speaker 2>it's artificial selection.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And we selected them for a couple of </v>

1314
01:16:06.100 --> 01:16:06.250
<v Speaker 2>things,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1315
01:16:06.370 --> 01:16:08.500
<v Speaker 2>If you look at the experiments on </v>
<v Speaker 2>breeding,</v>

1316
01:16:08.950 --> 01:16:10.090
<v Speaker 2>taking a Fox,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1317
01:16:10.091 --> 01:16:13.810
<v Speaker 2>taking foxes and breeding them into what</v>
<v Speaker 2>looked like a little dog like animals.</v>

1318
01:16:14.050 --> 01:16:19.050
<v Speaker 2>It's interesting what they can do and </v>
<v Speaker 2>one of the things they can do is they </v>

1319
01:16:19.050 --> 01:16:19.050
<v Speaker 2>can move their facial muscles and in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in,</v>

1320
01:16:19.100 --> 01:16:24.100
<v Speaker 2>in a lot of ways that they have a lot </v>
<v Speaker 2>more control over their facial muscles </v>

1321
01:16:24.100 --> 01:16:26.350
<v Speaker 2>then chimpanzees and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>do um,</v>

1322
01:16:26.440 --> 01:16:28.000
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and other apes,</v>

1323
01:16:28.200 --> 01:16:31.030
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and they also do,</v>

1324
01:16:31.031 --> 01:16:34.950
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they do joint attention really well with</v>

1325
01:16:34.951 --> 01:16:39.951
<v Speaker 2>gays.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So this is something that really no </v>

1326
01:16:39.951 --> 01:16:41.370
<v Speaker 2>other animal can do,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think other than a dog,</v>

1327
01:16:41.400 --> 01:16:43.470
<v Speaker 2>other end humans.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that is,</v>

1328
01:16:43.680 --> 01:16:45.150
<v Speaker 2>they can,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>

1329
01:16:45.690 --> 01:16:50.690
<v Speaker 2>they meet your gaze and they use gaze </v>
<v Speaker 2>for reference so you know,</v>

1330
01:16:51.911 --> 01:16:54.470
<v Speaker 2>they'll look at something and they'll </v>
<v Speaker 2>look back at you and you know,</v>

1331
01:16:54.520 --> 01:16:59.520
<v Speaker 2>that's actually partly,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's how we communicate with each </v>

1332
01:16:59.520 --> 01:16:59.520
<v Speaker 2>other.</v>

1333
01:16:59.520 --> 01:17:02.010
<v Speaker 2>Chimpanzees lose that ability after </v>
<v Speaker 2>about 10 or 11 months,</v>

1334
01:17:02.011 --> 01:17:04.290
<v Speaker 2>a year of age,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>

1335
01:17:04.350 --> 01:17:08.760
<v Speaker 2>but dogs continually do it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And actually joint attention,</v>

1336
01:17:08.810 --> 01:17:12.500
<v Speaker 2>shared gaze is how we communicate with </v>
<v Speaker 2>our infants will also.</v>

1337
01:17:12.501 --> 01:17:17.501
<v Speaker 2>That's actually partly how we teach </v>
<v Speaker 2>infants about what's important in the </v>

1338
01:17:17.501 --> 01:17:20.471
<v Speaker 2>world is with gays.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I think that dogs may actually have </v>

1339
01:17:20.471 --> 01:17:25.190
<v Speaker 2>some capacities probably because we bred</v>
<v Speaker 2>them to have those,</v>

1340
01:17:25.330 --> 01:17:28.300
<v Speaker 2>but we selected the animals that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1341
01:17:28.470 --> 01:17:29.930
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and bred them to,</v>

1342
01:17:29.980 --> 01:17:32.630
<v Speaker 2>to have those capacities.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's very interesting.</v>

1343
01:17:32.690 --> 01:17:33.800
<v Speaker 2>Thank you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Awesome.</v>

1344
01:17:33.801 --> 01:17:35.810
<v Speaker 2>What would that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let's get at least a big hand.</v>

1345
01:17:35.811 --> 01:17:36.320
<v Speaker 2>Thank you so much.</v>
