00:00:00.340 --> 00:00:02.320
<v Speaker 1>Welcome back to success zero,</v>
<v Speaker 1>nine,</v>

2
00:00:02.321 --> 00:00:06.640
<v Speaker 1>nine artificial general intelligence.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Today we have Stephen Wolfe from.</v>

3
00:00:07.940 --> 00:00:12.940
<v Speaker 2>Thank you.</v>

4
00:00:13.870 --> 00:00:15.520
<v Speaker 1>That's the first.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't even get started.</v>

5
00:00:15.521 --> 00:00:17.890
<v Speaker 1>You already clapping,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

6
00:00:17.891 --> 00:00:22.891
<v Speaker 1>in his book and you kind of.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sciencey has explored and reveal the </v>

7
00:00:22.891 --> 00:00:26.401
<v Speaker 1>power,</v>
<v Speaker 1>beauty and complexity of cellular </v>

8
00:00:26.401 --> 00:00:27.140
<v Speaker 1>Automata as simple computational </v>
<v Speaker 1>systems,</v>

9
00:00:27.141 --> 00:00:29.220
<v Speaker 1>which incredible complexity it can </v>
<v Speaker 1>emerge.</v>

10
00:00:30.180 --> 00:00:35.180
<v Speaker 1>It's actually one of the books that </v>
<v Speaker 1>really inspired me to get into </v>

11
00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:37.791
<v Speaker 1>artificial intelligence.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's created the Wolfram Alpha </v>

12
00:00:37.791 --> 00:00:40.581
<v Speaker 1>competition knowledge engine created </v>
<v Speaker 1>Mathematica that has now expanded to </v>

13
00:00:40.581 --> 00:00:44.511
<v Speaker 1>become wolfram language.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Both he and his son were involved in </v>

14
00:00:44.511 --> 00:00:46.890
<v Speaker 1>helping analyze,</v>
<v Speaker 1>create the alien language from the movie</v>

15
00:00:46.891 --> 00:00:49.800
<v Speaker 1>arrival of which they used the Wolfram </v>
<v Speaker 1>language.</v>

16
00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:53.010
<v Speaker 1>Please again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>give Steven a warm welcome.</v>

17
00:00:53.290 --> 00:00:58.100
<v Speaker 2>Thanks so much.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The</v>

18
00:00:58.150 --> 00:01:01.540
<v Speaker 3>brief here is to talk about how </v>
<v Speaker 3>artificial general intelligence is going</v>

19
00:01:01.541 --> 00:01:03.430
<v Speaker 3>to be achieved.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Is that the set,</v>

20
00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:05.160
<v Speaker 3>the basic picture?</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I,</v>

21
00:01:05.161 --> 00:01:07.610
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>maybe I'm reminded of kind of a storage.</v>

22
00:01:07.660 --> 00:01:09.280
<v Speaker 3>I don't think I've ever told them </v>
<v Speaker 3>public,</v>

23
00:01:09.281 --> 00:01:14.281
<v Speaker 3>but um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that something that happened just a few </v>

24
00:01:14.281 --> 00:01:16.750
<v Speaker 3>buildings over from here.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So this was 2009 and Wolfram Alpha was,</v>

25
00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:21.780
<v Speaker 3>was about to arrive on the scene.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I assume most of you have used wolf now </v>

26
00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:23.200
<v Speaker 3>for a cmo of Alpha.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>

27
00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:26.470
<v Speaker 3>The pump.</v>
<v Speaker 3>How many of you have used Wolf Malfa?</v>

28
00:01:27.550 --> 00:01:28.300
<v Speaker 3>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's good.</v>

29
00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:34.790
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so I had long been a friend of Marvin </v>

30
00:01:34.790 --> 00:01:39.180
<v Speaker 3>Minsky and Marvin was a sort of pioneer </v>
<v Speaker 3>of the ai world and I kind of seen for </v>

31
00:01:40.511 --> 00:01:41.660
<v Speaker 3>years,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

32
00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:44.050
<v Speaker 3>question answering systems that tried </v>
<v Speaker 3>to,</v>

33
00:01:44.470 --> 00:01:48.250
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to sort of general intelligence question</v>

34
00:01:48.251 --> 00:01:49.250
<v Speaker 3>answering.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so Marvin,</v>

35
00:01:49.930 --> 00:01:53.240
<v Speaker 3>and so I was going to show Marvin,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

36
00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:55.180
<v Speaker 3>Wolf Malfa,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he looks at it,</v>

37
00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:55.930
<v Speaker 3>he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

38
00:01:55.931 --> 00:01:56.980
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's fine.</v>

39
00:01:57.640 --> 00:01:59.170
<v Speaker 3>Whatever said no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Marvin,</v>

40
00:01:59.470 --> 00:02:03.940
<v Speaker 3>this time it actually works.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can try real questions.</v>

41
00:02:03.941 --> 00:02:07.090
<v Speaker 3>This is actually something useful.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is not just a toy.</v>

42
00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:09.190
<v Speaker 3>And it was kind of interesting to see.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It took.</v>

43
00:02:09.370 --> 00:02:14.370
<v Speaker 3>It took about five minutes from Marvin </v>
<v Speaker 3>to realize that this was finally a </v>

44
00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:17.791
<v Speaker 3>question answering system that could </v>
<v Speaker 3>actually answer questions that were </v>

45
00:02:17.791 --> 00:02:17.791
<v Speaker 3>useful to people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

46
00:02:17.791 --> 00:02:19.630
<v Speaker 3>and so one question is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how do we,</v>

47
00:02:19.631 --> 00:02:21.370
<v Speaker 3>how do we achieve that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

48
00:02:21.371 --> 00:02:26.371
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you go to wealth Malfa and you can ask </v>

49
00:02:26.371 --> 00:02:26.371
<v Speaker 3>it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

50
00:02:26.371 --> 00:02:26.371
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know what we can ask it.</v>

51
00:02:26.371 --> 00:02:26.530
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What's the,</v>

52
00:02:26.531 --> 00:02:27.660
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

53
00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:34.290
<v Speaker 3>some random question.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What does the population of Cambridge </v>

54
00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:34.800
<v Speaker 3>actually,</v>
<v Speaker 3>here's a question divided by.</v>

55
00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:37.480
<v Speaker 3>Let's try that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What's the population of Cambridge?</v>

56
00:02:37.481 --> 00:02:39.880
<v Speaker 3>It's probably gonna figure out that we </v>
<v Speaker 3>mean Cambridge,</v>

57
00:02:39.881 --> 00:02:41.590
<v Speaker 3>Massachusetts is going to give us some </v>
<v Speaker 3>number.</v>

58
00:02:41.591 --> 00:02:42.880
<v Speaker 3>It's going to give us some plot.</v>

59
00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:48.180
<v Speaker 3>Actually,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what I want to know is number of </v>

60
00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:50.941
<v Speaker 3>students at mit divided by population of</v>
<v Speaker 3>Cambridge specific configure that out.</v>

61
00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:55.510
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and uh,</v>

62
00:02:55.960 --> 00:02:58.120
<v Speaker 3>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's kind of interesting.</v>

63
00:02:58.150 --> 00:02:59.830
<v Speaker 3>I know that's divided by.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

64
00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:05.040
<v Speaker 3>that's interesting it guests that we </v>
<v Speaker 3>were talking about Cambridge University </v>

65
00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:05.740
<v Speaker 3>as the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>as the denominator there.</v>

66
00:03:05.741 --> 00:03:10.741
<v Speaker 3>So it says the number of students at mit</v>
<v Speaker 3>divided by the number of students at </v>

67
00:03:10.741 --> 00:03:10.930
<v Speaker 3>Cambridge University.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's interesting.</v>

68
00:03:10.931 --> 00:03:12.580
<v Speaker 3>I'm actually surprised.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Let's see what happens.</v>

69
00:03:12.581 --> 00:03:14.350
<v Speaker 3>If I say con Cambridge a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

70
00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:17.910
<v Speaker 3>I'm not as will probably fail horribly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

71
00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:18.790
<v Speaker 3>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's good.</v>

72
00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:20.290
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

73
00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:21.630
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

74
00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:26.640
<v Speaker 3>that's interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's a plot as a function of time of </v>

75
00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:26.830
<v Speaker 3>the fraction of the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

76
00:03:26.860 --> 00:03:28.150
<v Speaker 3>of um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>okay.</v>

77
00:03:28.180 --> 00:03:31.870
<v Speaker 3>So anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so I'm glad it works.</v>

78
00:03:32.170 --> 00:03:33.490
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the uh,</v>

79
00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:38.110
<v Speaker 3>so one,</v>
<v Speaker 3>one question is how did we manage to get</v>

80
00:03:38.111 --> 00:03:41.710
<v Speaker 3>so many things have to work in order to </v>
<v Speaker 3>get stuff like this to work,</v>

81
00:03:42.700 --> 00:03:44.800
<v Speaker 3>you have to be able to understand the </v>
<v Speaker 3>natural language,</v>

82
00:03:44.801 --> 00:03:49.801
<v Speaker 3>you have to have data sources,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you have to be able to compute things </v>

83
00:03:49.801 --> 00:03:49.801
<v Speaker 3>from the data and so on.</v>

84
00:03:50.050 --> 00:03:55.050
<v Speaker 3>One of the things that was a surprise to</v>
<v Speaker 3>me was in terms of natural language </v>

85
00:03:55.050 --> 00:03:58.321
<v Speaker 3>understanding was the critical thing </v>
<v Speaker 3>turned out to be just knowing a lot of </v>

86
00:03:58.811 --> 00:04:03.811
<v Speaker 3>stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The actual pausing of the national </v>

87
00:04:03.811 --> 00:04:05.110
<v Speaker 3>language is kind of a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think it's kind of clever and we use a</v>

88
00:04:05.111 --> 00:04:08.500
<v Speaker 3>bunch of ideas that came from my new </v>
<v Speaker 3>kind of science project and so on.</v>

89
00:04:08.860 --> 00:04:13.860
<v Speaker 3>But I think the most important thing is </v>
<v Speaker 3>just knowing a lot of stuff about the </v>

90
00:04:13.860 --> 00:04:17.101
<v Speaker 3>world is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is really important to actually being </v>

91
00:04:17.101 --> 00:04:18.420
<v Speaker 3>able to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to understand natural language in it and</v>

92
00:04:18.421 --> 00:04:23.090
<v Speaker 3>a useful situation.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think the other thing is having a,</v>

93
00:04:23.700 --> 00:04:25.950
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>actually having access to lots of data.</v>

94
00:04:25.990 --> 00:04:29.140
<v Speaker 3>Let me show you a typical example here </v>
<v Speaker 3>of what is needed.</v>

95
00:04:29.141 --> 00:04:34.141
<v Speaker 3>So I asked about the ISS and hopefully </v>
<v Speaker 3>it'll wake up and tell us something </v>

96
00:04:34.141 --> 00:04:34.240
<v Speaker 3>here.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Come on.</v>

97
00:04:34.270 --> 00:04:35.170
<v Speaker 3>What's going on here?</v>

98
00:04:35.510 --> 00:04:36.310
<v Speaker 3>There we go.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

99
00:04:36.670 --> 00:04:39.570
<v Speaker 3>So it figured out that we probably are </v>
<v Speaker 3>talking about a spacecraft,</v>

100
00:04:39.580 --> 00:04:44.580
<v Speaker 3>another file format,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and now it's going to give us a plot </v>

101
00:04:44.580 --> 00:04:45.100
<v Speaker 3>that shows us where the ISS is right </v>
<v Speaker 3>now.</v>

102
00:04:45.640 --> 00:04:50.640
<v Speaker 3>So to make this work we obviously have </v>
<v Speaker 3>to have some feed of a radar tracking </v>

103
00:04:51.431 --> 00:04:56.431
<v Speaker 3>data about satellites and so on,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which we have for every satellite </v>

104
00:04:56.431 --> 00:04:56.431
<v Speaker 3>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's out there.</v>

105
00:04:56.431 --> 00:05:01.250
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but then that's not good enough to just </v>

106
00:05:01.250 --> 00:05:03.361
<v Speaker 3>have that feed.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Then you also have to be able to do </v>

107
00:05:03.361 --> 00:05:06.190
<v Speaker 3>celestial mechanics to work out well.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Whereas the ISS actually right now based</v>

108
00:05:06.191 --> 00:05:11.191
<v Speaker 3>on the orbital elements that have been </v>
<v Speaker 3>deduced from radar and then if we want </v>

109
00:05:11.191 --> 00:05:11.191
<v Speaker 3>to know things like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

110
00:05:11.350 --> 00:05:13.870
<v Speaker 3>when is it going to.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not currently visible from Boston,</v>

111
00:05:13.871 --> 00:05:17.410
<v Speaker 3>Massachusetts.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It will next rise at 7:36</v>

112
00:05:17.440 --> 00:05:18.600
<v Speaker 3>PM,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

113
00:05:18.880 --> 00:05:21.650
<v Speaker 3>on Monday and today.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

114
00:05:22.570 --> 00:05:23.390
<v Speaker 3>so,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

115
00:05:23.410 --> 00:05:28.410
<v Speaker 3>this requires a mixture of data about </v>
<v Speaker 3>what's going on in the world together </v>

116
00:05:28.841 --> 00:05:31.990
<v Speaker 3>with models about how the world is </v>
<v Speaker 3>supposed to work.</v>

117
00:05:31.990 --> 00:05:36.990
<v Speaker 3>Being able to predict things and so on.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I think another thing that kind of </v>

118
00:05:36.990 --> 00:05:40.171
<v Speaker 3>realized about,</v>
<v Speaker 3>about Ai and so on from the Wolf Malfa </v>

119
00:05:41.290 --> 00:05:44.270
<v Speaker 3>effort has been that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

120
00:05:45.070 --> 00:05:50.070
<v Speaker 3>one of the earlier ideas for how long </v>
<v Speaker 3>would achieve ai was let's make it work.</v>

121
00:05:50.561 --> 00:05:52.970
<v Speaker 3>Kind of like brainstorm and let's make </v>
<v Speaker 3>it figure stuff out and stuff.</v>

122
00:05:52.980 --> 00:05:57.980
<v Speaker 3>It has to do physics,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let's have it do physics by pure </v>

123
00:05:57.980 --> 00:05:57.980
<v Speaker 3>reasoning.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

124
00:05:57.980 --> 00:05:58.390
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

125
00:05:58.400 --> 00:06:03.400
<v Speaker 3>people at least used to do physics,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but in the last 300 years we've had a </v>

126
00:06:03.441 --> 00:06:06.920
<v Speaker 3>different way to do physics that wasn't </v>
<v Speaker 3>sort of based on natural philosophy.</v>

127
00:06:07.130 --> 00:06:09.560
<v Speaker 3>It was instead based on things like </v>
<v Speaker 3>mathematics.</v>

128
00:06:09.890 --> 00:06:14.890
<v Speaker 3>And so one of the things that we were </v>
<v Speaker 3>doing and worth Malfa was to kind of </v>

129
00:06:14.890 --> 00:06:18.080
<v Speaker 3>cheat relative to what had been done in </v>
<v Speaker 3>previous ai systems,</v>

130
00:06:18.320 --> 00:06:20.810
<v Speaker 3>which was instead of using kind of </v>
<v Speaker 3>reasoning type methods,</v>

131
00:06:20.960 --> 00:06:21.800
<v Speaker 3>were just saying,</v>
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

132
00:06:21.801 --> 00:06:24.050
<v Speaker 3>we want to compute where the ISS is </v>
<v Speaker 3>going to be,</v>

133
00:06:24.240 --> 00:06:29.240
<v Speaker 3>but we've got a bunch of equations of </v>
<v Speaker 3>motion that correspond to differential </v>

134
00:06:29.240 --> 00:06:29.240
<v Speaker 3>equations.</v>

135
00:06:29.240 --> 00:06:30.380
<v Speaker 3>We're just going to solve the equations </v>
<v Speaker 3>of motion and get an answer.</v>

136
00:06:30.560 --> 00:06:33.560
<v Speaker 3>That's kind of leveraging the last 300 </v>
<v Speaker 3>years or so of,</v>

137
00:06:33.860 --> 00:06:35.900
<v Speaker 3>of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>of exact science that have been done,</v>

138
00:06:36.080 --> 00:06:39.170
<v Speaker 3>rather than trying to make use of kind </v>
<v Speaker 3>of human reasoning ideas.</v>

139
00:06:39.770 --> 00:06:44.770
<v Speaker 3>And I might might say that in terms of </v>
<v Speaker 3>the history of the wharf Malford </v>

140
00:06:44.770 --> 00:06:49.220
<v Speaker 3>project,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when I was a kid a disgustingly long </v>

141
00:06:49.220 --> 00:06:53.381
<v Speaker 3>time ago,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was interested in ai kinds of things </v>

142
00:06:53.381 --> 00:06:53.381
<v Speaker 3>and I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in fact,</v>

143
00:06:53.381 --> 00:06:56.690
<v Speaker 3>I was kind of upset recently to find a </v>
<v Speaker 3>bunch of stuff I did when I was 12 years</v>

144
00:06:56.691 --> 00:06:59.210
<v Speaker 3>old,</v>
<v Speaker 3>kind of trying to assemble a pre version</v>

145
00:06:59.211 --> 00:07:02.510
<v Speaker 3>of orphan malfa way back before it was </v>
<v Speaker 3>technologically possible.</v>

146
00:07:02.511 --> 00:07:05.360
<v Speaker 3>But it's also a reminder that one just </v>
<v Speaker 3>does the same thing.</v>

147
00:07:05.570 --> 00:07:08.360
<v Speaker 3>One's whole life,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so to speak at some level.</v>

148
00:07:08.600 --> 00:07:09.500
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but,</v>

149
00:07:09.501 --> 00:07:10.460
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

150
00:07:10.730 --> 00:07:12.440
<v Speaker 3>what happened was when,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when I,</v>

151
00:07:12.441 --> 00:07:17.441
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I started off working mainly in physics </v>

152
00:07:17.570 --> 00:07:22.570
<v Speaker 3>and then I got involved in building </v>
<v Speaker 3>computer systems to do things like </v>

153
00:07:22.570 --> 00:07:22.570
<v Speaker 3>mathematical computation and so on.</v>

154
00:07:22.790 --> 00:07:23.450
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

155
00:07:23.690 --> 00:07:25.970
<v Speaker 3>I then sort of got interested in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

156
00:07:26.120 --> 00:07:30.800
<v Speaker 3>so can we generalize this stuff and come</v>
<v Speaker 3>we can we really make a systems that can</v>

157
00:07:30.801 --> 00:07:34.460
<v Speaker 3>answer sort of arbitrary questions about</v>
<v Speaker 3>the world and for example,</v>

158
00:07:34.690 --> 00:07:35.470
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>sort of the,</v>

159
00:07:35.480 --> 00:07:36.030
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

160
00:07:36.050 --> 00:07:41.050
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the promise would be if there's </v>

161
00:07:41.050 --> 00:07:43.250
<v Speaker 3>something that is systematically no one </v>
<v Speaker 3>in our civilization make it automatic to</v>

162
00:07:43.251 --> 00:07:45.770
<v Speaker 3>answer questions on the base of that </v>
<v Speaker 3>systematic knowledge.</v>

163
00:07:46.190 --> 00:07:49.180
<v Speaker 3>And back in the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in around late 19 seventies,</v>

164
00:07:49.190 --> 00:07:54.190
<v Speaker 3>early 19 eighties,</v>
<v Speaker 3>my conclusion was that you wanted to do </v>

165
00:07:54.190 --> 00:07:54.380
<v Speaker 3>something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The only realistic path to being able to</v>

166
00:07:54.381 --> 00:07:56.870
<v Speaker 3>do it was to build something much like a</v>
<v Speaker 3>brain.</v>

167
00:07:57.200 --> 00:08:02.200
<v Speaker 3>And so I got interested in neural nets </v>
<v Speaker 3>and I tried to do things with neural </v>

168
00:08:02.200 --> 00:08:05.171
<v Speaker 3>nets back in 1980 and nothing very </v>
<v Speaker 3>interesting happened where I couldn't </v>

169
00:08:05.171 --> 00:08:05.750
<v Speaker 3>get them to do anything very </v>
<v Speaker 3>interesting.</v>

170
00:08:06.230 --> 00:08:07.850
<v Speaker 3>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that term.</v>

171
00:08:08.140 --> 00:08:13.140
<v Speaker 3>So I kind of had the idea that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that the only way to get the kind of </v>

172
00:08:13.140 --> 00:08:14.000
<v Speaker 3>thing that now exists in Wolf Malfa for </v>
<v Speaker 3>example,</v>

173
00:08:14.240 --> 00:08:18.620
<v Speaker 3>was to build a brain like thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then many years later,</v>

174
00:08:18.650 --> 00:08:23.650
<v Speaker 3>for reasons I can explain,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I kind of came back to this and </v>

175
00:08:23.650 --> 00:08:27.311
<v Speaker 3>realized,</v>
<v Speaker 3>actually it wasn't true that you had to </v>

176
00:08:27.311 --> 00:08:27.311
<v Speaker 3>build a brain,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like things sort of mere computation was</v>

177
00:08:27.311 --> 00:08:30.950
<v Speaker 3>sufficient and that was kind of what got</v>
<v Speaker 3>me started actually trying to build both</v>

178
00:08:30.951 --> 00:08:33.290
<v Speaker 3>Malfa when we started building wealth </v>
<v Speaker 3>Malfa,</v>

179
00:08:33.430 --> 00:08:38.430
<v Speaker 3>one of the things I did was go to a sort</v>
<v Speaker 3>of a field trip to a big reference </v>

180
00:08:38.430 --> 00:08:42.041
<v Speaker 3>library and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you see all these shelves of books and </v>

181
00:08:42.041 --> 00:08:42.041
<v Speaker 3>so on.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And the question is,</v>

182
00:08:42.041 --> 00:08:46.301
<v Speaker 3>can we take all of this knowledge that </v>
<v Speaker 3>exists in all of these books and </v>

183
00:08:46.301 --> 00:08:48.110
<v Speaker 3>actually automate being able to answer </v>
<v Speaker 3>questions on the basis of it.</v>

184
00:08:48.380 --> 00:08:50.570
<v Speaker 3>And I think we've pretty much done that </v>
<v Speaker 3>for that,</v>

185
00:08:50.630 --> 00:08:53.240
<v Speaker 3>at least the books you find than a </v>
<v Speaker 3>typical reference library.</v>

186
00:08:53.530 --> 00:08:55.030
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so that was a,</v>

187
00:08:55.530 --> 00:08:57.920
<v Speaker 3>it looked kind of daunting at the </v>
<v Speaker 3>beginning because it's this,</v>

188
00:08:58.020 --> 00:09:00.540
<v Speaker 3>there's a lot of knowledge and </v>
<v Speaker 3>information out there.</v>

189
00:09:00.780 --> 00:09:05.780
<v Speaker 3>But actually it turns out there are a </v>
<v Speaker 3>few thousand domains and we've steadily </v>

190
00:09:05.780 --> 00:09:07.080
<v Speaker 3>gone through and worked on these </v>
<v Speaker 3>different domains.</v>

191
00:09:07.290 --> 00:09:10.380
<v Speaker 3>Another feature of the wharf project was</v>
<v Speaker 3>that we didn't really,</v>

192
00:09:10.600 --> 00:09:11.150
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

193
00:09:11.160 --> 00:09:14.670
<v Speaker 3>I've been involved a lot in doing basic </v>
<v Speaker 3>science and trying to have sort of grand</v>

194
00:09:14.671 --> 00:09:17.940
<v Speaker 3>theories of the world.</v>
<v Speaker 3>One of my principals in building Wolfram</v>

195
00:09:17.940 --> 00:09:22.940
<v Speaker 3>Alpha was not to start from a grand </v>
<v Speaker 3>theory of the world that is not to kind </v>

196
00:09:22.940 --> 00:09:26.241
<v Speaker 3>of start from some global ontology of </v>
<v Speaker 3>the world and then try and build down </v>

197
00:09:26.241 --> 00:09:28.530
<v Speaker 3>into all these different domains,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but instead to work up from having,</v>

198
00:09:28.690 --> 00:09:33.690
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>hundreds then thousands of domains that </v>

199
00:09:33.690 --> 00:09:33.690
<v Speaker 3>actually work,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whether they're,</v>

200
00:09:33.690 --> 00:09:37.450
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>information about cars or information </v>

201
00:09:37.450 --> 00:09:38.070
<v Speaker 3>about sports or information about movies</v>
<v Speaker 3>or whatever else,</v>

202
00:09:38.280 --> 00:09:39.810
<v Speaker 3>how each of these domains.</v>

203
00:09:40.060 --> 00:09:43.230
<v Speaker 3>I'm sort of building up from the bottom </v>
<v Speaker 3>in each of these domains.</v>

204
00:09:43.500 --> 00:09:48.500
<v Speaker 3>And then finding that there were common </v>
<v Speaker 3>themes in these domains that we could </v>

205
00:09:48.500 --> 00:09:51.411
<v Speaker 3>then build into frameworks and then sort</v>
<v Speaker 3>of construct the whole system on the </v>

206
00:09:51.411 --> 00:09:51.750
<v Speaker 3>basis of that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that's kind of,</v>

207
00:09:51.810 --> 00:09:56.810
<v Speaker 3>that's kind of how it's worked.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I can talk about some of the actual </v>

208
00:09:56.810 --> 00:09:56.810
<v Speaker 3>frameworks that we ended up using and so</v>
<v Speaker 3>on.</v>

209
00:09:56.810 --> 00:09:57.420
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but,</v>

210
00:09:57.421 --> 00:10:02.421
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>maybe I should explain a little bit </v>

211
00:10:02.421 --> 00:10:02.421
<v Speaker 3>more.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

212
00:10:02.421 --> 00:10:03.870
<v Speaker 3>so one question is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how does,</v>

213
00:10:03.900 --> 00:10:06.480
<v Speaker 3>how does wealth map are actually sort of</v>
<v Speaker 3>work inside?</v>

214
00:10:06.930 --> 00:10:09.990
<v Speaker 3>And the answer is it's a big program,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's about,</v>

215
00:10:10.380 --> 00:10:14.280
<v Speaker 3>it's the core system has about 15 </v>
<v Speaker 3>million lines of Wolfram language code,</v>

216
00:10:14.580 --> 00:10:17.220
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and it's some number of terabytes of raw</v>

217
00:10:17.221 --> 00:10:18.260
<v Speaker 3>data.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

218
00:10:18.990 --> 00:10:21.340
<v Speaker 3>and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so the,</v>

219
00:10:21.500 --> 00:10:26.500
<v Speaker 3>the way,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the thing that sort of made building </v>

220
00:10:26.500 --> 00:10:29.631
<v Speaker 3>wealth now for possible was this </v>
<v Speaker 3>language Wolfram from language which </v>

221
00:10:29.631 --> 00:10:33.330
<v Speaker 3>started with Mathematica,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which came out in 1988 and has been sort</v>

222
00:10:33.331 --> 00:10:35.010
<v Speaker 3>of progressively growing since then.</v>

223
00:10:35.340 --> 00:10:37.950
<v Speaker 3>So maybe I should show you some things </v>
<v Speaker 3>about wealth language and,</v>

224
00:10:37.980 --> 00:10:38.610
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

225
00:10:39.030 --> 00:10:39.840
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's easy.</v>

226
00:10:39.841 --> 00:10:42.960
<v Speaker 3>You can go use this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Mit has a site license for it,</v>

227
00:10:42.961 --> 00:10:46.500
<v Speaker 3>you can use it all over the place,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can find it on the web,</v>

228
00:10:46.501 --> 00:10:47.100
<v Speaker 3>et Cetera,</v>
<v Speaker 3>et Cetera,</v>

229
00:10:47.101 --> 00:10:48.390
<v Speaker 3>et cetera.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

230
00:10:48.810 --> 00:10:49.530
<v Speaker 3>but,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

231
00:10:50.590 --> 00:10:52.860
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the basics work.</v>

232
00:10:53.190 --> 00:10:54.420
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the uh,</v>

233
00:10:54.440 --> 00:10:55.050
<v Speaker 3>let,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let's,</v>

234
00:10:55.080 --> 00:11:00.080
<v Speaker 3>let's start off with something like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let's make a random graph and um,</v>

235
00:11:00.660 --> 00:11:03.330
<v Speaker 3>let's say we have a random graph with </v>
<v Speaker 3>200 nodes,</v>

236
00:11:03.331 --> 00:11:04.500
<v Speaker 3>400 vertices.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

237
00:11:04.501 --> 00:11:09.501
<v Speaker 3>So those isn't random graph.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The first important thing about Wilson </v>

238
00:11:09.501 --> 00:11:09.501
<v Speaker 3>languages,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's a symbolic language.</v>

239
00:11:09.501 --> 00:11:12.010
<v Speaker 3>So I can just pick up this graph and I </v>
<v Speaker 3>could say,</v>

240
00:11:12.011 --> 00:11:17.011
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I want to do some analysis of this </v>

241
00:11:17.011 --> 00:11:17.011
<v Speaker 3>graph.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That graph is just a symbolic thing that</v>

242
00:11:17.011 --> 00:11:20.310
<v Speaker 3>I can just do computations on.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Or I could say let's,</v>

243
00:11:20.311 --> 00:11:22.010
<v Speaker 3>let's get a um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a,</v>

244
00:11:22.210 --> 00:11:25.110
<v Speaker 3>another good thing to do is get a </v>
<v Speaker 3>current image.</v>

245
00:11:25.710 --> 00:11:26.880
<v Speaker 3>See,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there we go.</v>

246
00:11:27.270 --> 00:11:32.270
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and now I could go and say something </v>

247
00:11:32.270 --> 00:11:32.270
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

248
00:11:32.270 --> 00:11:32.270
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let's,</v>

249
00:11:32.270 --> 00:11:37.250
<v Speaker 3>let's do some basic thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Let's say let's edge detect that image </v>

250
00:11:37.250 --> 00:11:37.250
<v Speaker 3>again,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this,</v>

251
00:11:37.250 --> 00:11:40.320
<v Speaker 3>this image is just a thing that we can </v>
<v Speaker 3>manipulate.</v>

252
00:11:40.321 --> 00:11:42.030
<v Speaker 3>We could take the image,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we could make it.</v>

253
00:11:42.031 --> 00:11:43.270
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

254
00:11:44.450 --> 00:11:46.620
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We could take the image and petitioners,</v>

255
00:11:46.621 --> 00:11:49.410
<v Speaker 3>little pieces.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Do computations on that.</v>

256
00:11:49.770 --> 00:11:50.850
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Simple.</v>

257
00:11:50.910 --> 00:11:55.910
<v Speaker 3>Let's do,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let's just say sought each row of the </v>

258
00:11:55.910 --> 00:11:56.470
<v Speaker 3>image.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Assemble the image again.</v>

259
00:11:56.471 --> 00:11:56.950
<v Speaker 3>Whoops.</v>

260
00:12:00.820 --> 00:12:02.230
<v Speaker 3>Assemble,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let image again.</v>

261
00:12:02.231 --> 00:12:04.300
<v Speaker 3>We'll get some,</v>
<v Speaker 3>some mixed up picture there.</v>

262
00:12:04.630 --> 00:12:05.650
<v Speaker 3>If I wanted to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I could,</v>

263
00:12:05.651 --> 00:12:10.651
<v Speaker 3>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let's say let's make that the current </v>

264
00:12:10.651 --> 00:12:12.601
<v Speaker 3>image and let's say make that dynamic.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I can be just running that code </v>

265
00:12:12.701 --> 00:12:15.430
<v Speaker 3>hopefully,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and it'll loop and we can,</v>

266
00:12:15.830 --> 00:12:17.410
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>make that work.</v>

267
00:12:17.770 --> 00:12:22.660
<v Speaker 3>So the one,</v>
<v Speaker 3>one general point here is,</v>

268
00:12:23.100 --> 00:12:28.100
<v Speaker 3>there's no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is just an image for us is just a </v>

269
00:12:28.100 --> 00:12:28.100
<v Speaker 3>piece of data.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like anything else,</v>

270
00:12:28.100 --> 00:12:30.300
<v Speaker 3>if we just have a variable a thing </v>
<v Speaker 3>called x,</v>

271
00:12:30.301 --> 00:12:31.150
<v Speaker 3>it just says,</v>
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

272
00:12:31.151 --> 00:12:33.580
<v Speaker 3>that's X.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't need to know particular value.</v>

273
00:12:33.581 --> 00:12:37.390
<v Speaker 3>It's just a symbolic thing that </v>
<v Speaker 3>corresponds to a,</v>

274
00:12:37.440 --> 00:12:40.300
<v Speaker 3>that's a thing called x.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now you know,</v>

275
00:12:40.360 --> 00:12:45.360
<v Speaker 3>what gets interesting when you have a </v>
<v Speaker 3>symbolic language and so on is we're </v>

276
00:12:45.401 --> 00:12:49.750
<v Speaker 3>interested in having it represent stuff </v>
<v Speaker 3>about the world as well as just abstract</v>

277
00:12:49.751 --> 00:12:50.380
<v Speaker 3>kinds of things.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

278
00:12:50.381 --> 00:12:50.610
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

279
00:12:50.620 --> 00:12:52.440
<v Speaker 3>I can abstractly say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

280
00:12:52.810 --> 00:12:55.400
<v Speaker 3>find some funky integral,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

281
00:12:56.290 --> 00:12:57.340
<v Speaker 3>I don't know what,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

282
00:12:57.341 --> 00:13:02.341
<v Speaker 3>that's then representing a using </v>
<v Speaker 3>symbolic variables to represent </v>

283
00:13:02.341 --> 00:13:03.490
<v Speaker 3>algebraic kinds of things.</v>

284
00:13:03.490 --> 00:13:08.490
<v Speaker 3>But I could also just say I dunno,</v>
<v Speaker 3>something like Boston and Boston is </v>

285
00:13:08.490 --> 00:13:11.310
<v Speaker 3>another kind of symbolic thing that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

286
00:13:11.470 --> 00:13:12.800
<v Speaker 3>has.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If I say what,</v>

287
00:13:12.801 --> 00:13:15.760
<v Speaker 3>what does it really inside that's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's the entity,</v>

288
00:13:16.140 --> 00:13:17.620
<v Speaker 3>a city,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Boston,</v>

289
00:13:17.621 --> 00:13:22.621
<v Speaker 3>Massachusetts,</v>
<v Speaker 3>United States actually noticed when I </v>

290
00:13:22.621 --> 00:13:25.471
<v Speaker 3>type that in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was using natural language to type it </v>

291
00:13:25.471 --> 00:13:26.230
<v Speaker 3>in and it gave me a bunch of </v>
<v Speaker 3>disambiguation here.</v>

292
00:13:26.231 --> 00:13:28.660
<v Speaker 3>It said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>assuming Boston as a city,</v>

293
00:13:28.960 --> 00:13:29.830
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>assuming Boston,</v>

294
00:13:29.831 --> 00:13:31.180
<v Speaker 3>Massachusetts,</v>
<v Speaker 3>use Boston,</v>

295
00:13:31.181 --> 00:13:32.350
<v Speaker 3>New York or.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay,</v>

296
00:13:32.351 --> 00:13:33.130
<v Speaker 3>there's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let's use,</v>

297
00:13:33.370 --> 00:13:35.860
<v Speaker 3>let's use Boston in the Philippines,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which I've never heard of,</v>

298
00:13:35.861 --> 00:13:37.580
<v Speaker 3>but um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

299
00:13:37.650 --> 00:13:40.240
<v Speaker 3>let's try using that instead.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And now if I look at that,</v>

300
00:13:40.540 --> 00:13:43.720
<v Speaker 3>it'll say it's Boston in some province </v>
<v Speaker 3>of the Philippines,</v>

301
00:13:43.730 --> 00:13:44.290
<v Speaker 3>etc.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Etc.</v>

302
00:13:44.300 --> 00:13:46.990
<v Speaker 3>Etc.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now I might ask it of that.</v>

303
00:13:46.991 --> 00:13:51.991
<v Speaker 3>I could say somEthing like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what's the population of that?</v>

304
00:13:52.320 --> 00:13:53.980
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and it,</v>

305
00:13:53.981 --> 00:13:55.650
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

306
00:13:55.660 --> 00:13:57.310
<v Speaker 3>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a fairly small place.</v>

307
00:13:57.640 --> 00:13:58.900
<v Speaker 3>Or I could say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for example,</v>

308
00:13:58.901 --> 00:13:59.770
<v Speaker 3>let me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let me do this.</v>

309
00:13:59.771 --> 00:14:04.771
<v Speaker 3>Let me say jill list plot from that </v>
<v Speaker 3>bostoN a take from that boston too.</v>

310
00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:14.000
<v Speaker 3>And now let's type In boston again and </v>
<v Speaker 3>now let's have it used the default </v>

311
00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:15.790
<v Speaker 3>meaning of the word of boston.</v>
<v Speaker 3>and then let's join those up.</v>

312
00:14:16.130 --> 00:14:17.870
<v Speaker 3>And now this should plot,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

313
00:14:17.950 --> 00:14:21.010
<v Speaker 3>this should show me a plot.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There we go.</v>

314
00:14:21.011 --> 00:14:22.030
<v Speaker 3>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so there's the,</v>

315
00:14:22.031 --> 00:14:25.330
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a path from the boston that we picked in</v>

316
00:14:25.331 --> 00:14:27.370
<v Speaker 3>the Philippines to the boston here.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

317
00:14:27.371 --> 00:14:28.330
<v Speaker 3>we could ask it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>

318
00:14:28.331 --> 00:14:29.360
<v Speaker 3>I could just say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

319
00:14:29.810 --> 00:14:32.620
<v Speaker 3>I could ask it the distance from one to </v>
<v Speaker 3>another or something like that.</v>

320
00:14:33.130 --> 00:14:34.420
<v Speaker 3>So the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

321
00:14:34.421 --> 00:14:37.810
<v Speaker 3>one of the thIngs here,</v>
<v Speaker 3>one things we found really,</v>

322
00:14:37.840 --> 00:14:40.050
<v Speaker 3>really useful actually in both </v>
<v Speaker 3>languages.</v>

323
00:14:40.051 --> 00:14:45.051
<v Speaker 3>The first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's a way of representing stuff </v>

324
00:14:45.051 --> 00:14:45.051
<v Speaker 3>about the world,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like cities for example.</v>

325
00:14:45.100 --> 00:14:46.450
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let's say I want to say let's,</v>

326
00:14:46.451 --> 00:14:47.740
<v Speaker 3>let's do this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Let's say,</v>

327
00:14:48.220 --> 00:14:49.860
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

328
00:14:49.870 --> 00:14:54.870
<v Speaker 3>let's do something,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let's say capital cities in south </v>

329
00:14:54.870 --> 00:14:54.870
<v Speaker 3>America.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

330
00:14:54.870 --> 00:14:56.540
<v Speaker 3>So notice this is a piece of natural </v>
<v Speaker 3>language.</v>

331
00:14:56.870 --> 00:15:01.870
<v Speaker 3>This will get interpreted into something</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is precise symbolic language code </v>

332
00:15:03.500 --> 00:15:07.310
<v Speaker 3>that we can then compute with and that </v>
<v Speaker 3>will give us the citizens of the capital</v>

333
00:15:07.311 --> 00:15:09.500
<v Speaker 3>cities in south America.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I could,</v>

334
00:15:09.501 --> 00:15:12.040
<v Speaker 3>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let's say I say fine shortest tour.</v>

335
00:15:12.041 --> 00:15:14.510
<v Speaker 3>So now I'm going to use some,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

336
00:15:14.990 --> 00:15:16.280
<v Speaker 3>some ups.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

337
00:15:16.281 --> 00:15:18.950
<v Speaker 3>I don't want to do that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I want to do first is to say,</v>

338
00:15:18.951 --> 00:15:23.220
<v Speaker 3>show me the job positions of all those </v>
<v Speaker 3>cities online,</v>

339
00:15:23.330 --> 00:15:28.330
<v Speaker 3>21 there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so now it will find the geo positions </v>

340
00:15:28.330 --> 00:15:28.970
<v Speaker 3>and now we'll say compute the shortest </v>
<v Speaker 3>tour.</v>

341
00:15:29.210 --> 00:15:34.210
<v Speaker 3>So that's saying there's a 10,000</v>
<v Speaker 3>mile traveling salesman tour around </v>

342
00:15:34.371 --> 00:15:36.770
<v Speaker 3>those cities.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I could take those cities were online</v>

343
00:15:36.771 --> 00:15:41.771
<v Speaker 3>21 and I could say order the cities </v>
<v Speaker 3>according to this and then I could make </v>

344
00:15:42.171 --> 00:15:46.040
<v Speaker 3>another geo lists a lot of that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>join it up.</v>

345
00:15:46.450 --> 00:15:49.480
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and this should now show us a,</v>

346
00:15:49.481 --> 00:15:51.880
<v Speaker 3>a traveling salesman tour of the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

347
00:15:51.910 --> 00:15:54.690
<v Speaker 3>of the capital cities in south America.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

348
00:15:55.010 --> 00:15:56.210
<v Speaker 3>so,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

349
00:15:56.211 --> 00:16:01.211
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's sort of interesting to see what's </v>

350
00:16:01.211 --> 00:16:01.211
<v Speaker 3>involved in making stuff like this work.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

351
00:16:01.211 --> 00:16:02.540
<v Speaker 3>the uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

352
00:16:03.020 --> 00:16:08.020
<v Speaker 3>one of my,</v>
<v Speaker 3>my goal has been to sort of automate as </v>

353
00:16:08.020 --> 00:16:12.191
<v Speaker 3>much as possible about things that have </v>
<v Speaker 3>to be computed and that means knowing as</v>

354
00:16:12.380 --> 00:16:17.380
<v Speaker 3>many algorithms as possible and also </v>
<v Speaker 3>knowing as much data about the world as </v>

355
00:16:17.380 --> 00:16:22.241
<v Speaker 3>possible.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I kind of view this as sort of a </v>

356
00:16:22.241 --> 00:16:25.210
<v Speaker 3>knowledge based programming approach </v>
<v Speaker 3>where you have a typical kind of idea </v>

357
00:16:25.881 --> 00:16:30.881
<v Speaker 3>and programming languages as you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we have some small programming </v>

358
00:16:30.881 --> 00:16:33.791
<v Speaker 3>languages,</v>
<v Speaker 3>has a few primitives that are pretty </v>

359
00:16:33.791 --> 00:16:36.341
<v Speaker 3>much tied into what a machine can </v>
<v Speaker 3>intrinsically do and then maybe you'll </v>

360
00:16:36.341 --> 00:16:38.270
<v Speaker 3>have libraries that add onto that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so on.</v>

361
00:16:38.510 --> 00:16:43.510
<v Speaker 3>My kind of a crazy idea of many,</v>
<v Speaker 3>many years ago has been to build an </v>

362
00:16:44.031 --> 00:16:48.800
<v Speaker 3>integrated system where all of the stuff</v>
<v Speaker 3>about different domains of knowledge and</v>

363
00:16:48.801 --> 00:16:52.460
<v Speaker 3>so on are all just built into the system</v>
<v Speaker 3>and uh,</v>

364
00:16:52.640 --> 00:16:57.640
<v Speaker 3>and designed in a coherent way.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean this has been kind of the story </v>

365
00:16:57.640 --> 00:17:00.941
<v Speaker 3>of my life for the last 30 years,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is trying to keep the design of the </v>

366
00:17:00.941 --> 00:17:03.761
<v Speaker 3>system coherent even as one adds all </v>
<v Speaker 3>sorts of different areas of,</v>

367
00:17:04.250 --> 00:17:04.980
<v Speaker 3>of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

368
00:17:05.630 --> 00:17:09.020
<v Speaker 3>of capability.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So as,</v>

369
00:17:09.021 --> 00:17:11.270
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean we can go and dive into all sorts</v>

370
00:17:11.271 --> 00:17:12.820
<v Speaker 3>of different kinds of things here.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But,</v>

371
00:17:12.821 --> 00:17:15.050
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>maybe as an example.</v>

372
00:17:15.290 --> 00:17:15.980
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let's do,</v>

373
00:17:15.981 --> 00:17:18.210
<v Speaker 3>what could we do here we could take.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

374
00:17:18.500 --> 00:17:20.690
<v Speaker 3>let's try.</v>
<v Speaker 3>How about this?</v>

375
00:17:20.691 --> 00:17:23.000
<v Speaker 3>Is that a bone?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think so that's a bone.</v>

376
00:17:23.480 --> 00:17:28.480
<v Speaker 3>So let's try a that as a mesh region,</v>
<v Speaker 3>see if that works.</v>

377
00:17:32.540 --> 00:17:35.120
<v Speaker 3>So this will now Use a completely </v>
<v Speaker 3>different domain of,</v>

378
00:17:35.121 --> 00:17:36.860
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>of human endeavor.</v>

379
00:17:36.890 --> 00:17:37.640
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Whoops.</v>

380
00:17:37.641 --> 00:17:39.200
<v Speaker 3>There's two of those buttons.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Let's try,</v>

381
00:17:39.201 --> 00:17:44.201
<v Speaker 3>let's just try a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let's try left humerus and let's try </v>

382
00:17:44.901 --> 00:17:45.480
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

383
00:17:45.560 --> 00:17:48.080
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the mesh region for that.</v>

384
00:17:48.560 --> 00:17:50.700
<v Speaker 3>And now we should have a bone here.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

385
00:17:50.770 --> 00:17:54.090
<v Speaker 3>There's a representational of bone.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Let's take that bone.</v>

386
00:17:54.150 --> 00:17:55.020
<v Speaker 3>We could,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for example,</v>

387
00:17:55.021 --> 00:18:00.021
<v Speaker 3>say um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let's take the surface area of that as </v>

388
00:18:00.021 --> 00:18:04.551
<v Speaker 3>in some some units or I could let,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let's do some much more outrageous </v>

389
00:18:04.551 --> 00:18:04.551
<v Speaker 3>thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Let's say we take,</v>

390
00:18:04.870 --> 00:18:06.780
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>region distance.</v>

391
00:18:06.781 --> 00:18:10.050
<v Speaker 3>So we're going to take the distance from</v>
<v Speaker 3>some,</v>

392
00:18:10.080 --> 00:18:15.080
<v Speaker 3>from that bone to a point,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let's say zero,</v>

393
00:18:15.451 --> 00:18:16.410
<v Speaker 3>zero,</v>
<v Speaker 3>z,</v>

394
00:18:16.770 --> 00:18:21.770
<v Speaker 3>and let's make a plot of that distance </v>
<v Speaker 3>with z going from,</v>

395
00:18:22.080 --> 00:18:24.960
<v Speaker 3>let's say I have no idea where the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>where the bone is,</v>

396
00:18:24.961 --> 00:18:27.960
<v Speaker 3>but let's try something like this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So that was really borIng.</v>

397
00:18:30.920 --> 00:18:31.900
<v Speaker 3>Let's try.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

398
00:18:32.490 --> 00:18:34.110
<v Speaker 3>so what this is doing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>again,</v>

399
00:18:34.350 --> 00:18:36.680
<v Speaker 3>a whole bunch of stuff has to work in </v>
<v Speaker 3>order for this to,</v>

400
00:18:36.740 --> 00:18:38.280
<v Speaker 3>to operate this test,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to be.</v>

401
00:18:38.281 --> 00:18:43.281
<v Speaker 3>This is a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is some region in three d space </v>

402
00:18:43.281 --> 00:18:43.740
<v Speaker 3>that's represented by some mesh.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You have to compute,</v>

403
00:18:43.790 --> 00:18:48.790
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>do the computational geometry to figure </v>

404
00:18:48.790 --> 00:18:48.790
<v Speaker 3>out where it is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If I wanted to let,</v>

405
00:18:48.790 --> 00:18:50.790
<v Speaker 3>let's try anatomy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>anatomy,</v>

406
00:18:50.791 --> 00:18:55.791
<v Speaker 3>plot three d,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and let's say something like lefthand </v>

407
00:18:55.791 --> 00:18:59.390
<v Speaker 3>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and now it's going to show us probably </v>

408
00:18:59.390 --> 00:19:00.390
<v Speaker 3>the complete data that it has about the </v>
<v Speaker 3>geometry of,</v>

409
00:19:00.420 --> 00:19:00.990
<v Speaker 3>of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

410
00:19:01.420 --> 00:19:04.050
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>of a lefthand.</v>

411
00:19:05.420 --> 00:19:06.710
<v Speaker 3>There we gO.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

412
00:19:07.200 --> 00:19:08.040
<v Speaker 3>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So there's,</v>

413
00:19:08.090 --> 00:19:13.090
<v Speaker 3>there's the results.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And we could take that apart and start </v>

414
00:19:13.090 --> 00:19:13.090
<v Speaker 3>computIng things from it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so on.</v>

415
00:19:13.090 --> 00:19:17.930
<v Speaker 3>So what I'm a.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So this is,</v>

416
00:19:19.490 --> 00:19:20.590
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

417
00:19:22.140 --> 00:19:22.580
<v Speaker 3>so there's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

418
00:19:22.581 --> 00:19:25.710
<v Speaker 3>there's a lot of kind of computational </v>
<v Speaker 3>knowledge that's built in here.</v>

419
00:19:26.120 --> 00:19:27.510
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>one,</v>

420
00:19:28.150 --> 00:19:28.490
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let's,</v>

421
00:19:28.500 --> 00:19:31.580
<v Speaker 3>let's talk a little bit about kind of </v>
<v Speaker 3>the modern machine learning story.</v>

422
00:19:31.581 --> 00:19:33.270
<v Speaker 3>So for instance,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if I say,</v>

423
00:19:33.540 --> 00:19:35.160
<v Speaker 3>let's get a picture here.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Let's say,</v>

424
00:19:35.161 --> 00:19:36.390
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let's,</v>

425
00:19:36.420 --> 00:19:40.500
<v Speaker 3>let's just say picture of assembly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Got a favorite kind of animal.</v>

426
00:19:43.050 --> 00:19:44.910
<v Speaker 3>What?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Panda.</v>

427
00:19:48.510 --> 00:19:50.010
<v Speaker 3>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so let's try.</v>

428
00:19:50.490 --> 00:19:52.050
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Giant panda.</v>

429
00:19:52.680 --> 00:19:54.000
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay,</v>

430
00:19:54.010 --> 00:19:55.770
<v Speaker 3>there's a panda.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Let's see what,</v>

431
00:19:55.771 --> 00:19:58.020
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>now let's try saying,</v>

432
00:19:59.510 --> 00:20:02.880
<v Speaker 3>let's try for this panda.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Let's try saying image identify,</v>

433
00:20:03.840 --> 00:20:05.640
<v Speaker 3>and now here will be embarrassed </v>
<v Speaker 3>probably,</v>

434
00:20:05.641 --> 00:20:07.560
<v Speaker 3>but let's just see.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Let's see what happens.</v>

435
00:20:07.561 --> 00:20:12.561
<v Speaker 3>If I say image,</v>
<v Speaker 3>identify that and now it'll hopefully </v>

436
00:20:12.960 --> 00:20:13.800
<v Speaker 3>wake up,</v>
<v Speaker 3>wake up,</v>

437
00:20:13.801 --> 00:20:18.801
<v Speaker 3>wake up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This only takes a few hundred </v>

438
00:20:18.801 --> 00:20:18.801
<v Speaker 3>milliseconds.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay,</v>

439
00:20:18.801 --> 00:20:18.801
<v Speaker 3>very good.</v>
<v Speaker 3>John panto.</v>

440
00:20:18.801 --> 00:20:18.810
<v Speaker 3>Let's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let's see what it will see.</v>

441
00:20:18.811 --> 00:20:20.940
<v Speaker 3>What the runners up were to the giant </v>
<v Speaker 3>panda.</v>

442
00:20:21.480 --> 00:20:23.160
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

443
00:20:25.020 --> 00:20:30.020
<v Speaker 3>let's say we want to say the ten one is </v>
<v Speaker 3>up in all categories for that thing.</v>

444
00:20:31.290 --> 00:20:33.360
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So giant panda,</v>

445
00:20:33.370 --> 00:20:36.690
<v Speaker 3>a kitchenaid,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which I've never heard of.</v>

446
00:20:37.460 --> 00:20:42.210
<v Speaker 3>Our pandas.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Commerce eat bamboo shoots.</v>

447
00:20:42.211 --> 00:20:44.340
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So that was so lucky.</v>

448
00:20:44.341 --> 00:20:49.341
<v Speaker 3>It didn't get that one.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's really sure it's a mammal and it's </v>

449
00:20:49.341 --> 00:20:50.620
<v Speaker 3>absolutely certain it's a vertebrate.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

450
00:20:50.621 --> 00:20:52.840
<v Speaker 3>So you might ask how did it figure this </v>
<v Speaker 3>out?</v>

451
00:20:53.370 --> 00:20:57.190
<v Speaker 3>And so then you can kind of look under </v>
<v Speaker 3>the hood and say,</v>

452
00:20:57.660 --> 00:21:01.420
<v Speaker 3>so we have a whole framework for </v>
<v Speaker 3>representing neuron that symbolically.</v>

453
00:21:01.750 --> 00:21:05.560
<v Speaker 3>And so this is the actual model that </v>
<v Speaker 3>it's using to do this.</v>

454
00:21:05.561 --> 00:21:08.800
<v Speaker 3>So this is a um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so there's a neural net and it's got.</v>

455
00:21:09.070 --> 00:21:12.520
<v Speaker 3>We can drill down and we can see there's</v>
<v Speaker 3>a piece of the neural net.</v>

456
00:21:12.880 --> 00:21:17.880
<v Speaker 3>We can drill down even further to one of</v>
<v Speaker 3>these and we can probably see what </v>

457
00:21:17.880 --> 00:21:18.310
<v Speaker 3>that's our batch normalization layer </v>
<v Speaker 3>somewhere deep,</v>

458
00:21:18.640 --> 00:21:21.490
<v Speaker 3>deep inside the trails of the not </v>
<v Speaker 3>pander,</v>

459
00:21:21.491 --> 00:21:23.950
<v Speaker 3>but to have this thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay,</v>

460
00:21:24.190 --> 00:21:28.060
<v Speaker 3>so now let's take that object which has </v>
<v Speaker 3>just a symbolic object and let's feed it</v>

461
00:21:28.120 --> 00:21:33.120
<v Speaker 3>the picture of the panda and we can see </v>
<v Speaker 3>'em and the ups.</v>

462
00:21:34.630 --> 00:21:37.660
<v Speaker 3>I was not giving up the right thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What did I do wrong here?</v>

463
00:21:37.960 --> 00:21:38.710
<v Speaker 3>Let's.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Let's take.</v>

464
00:21:38.770 --> 00:21:39.550
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I see what I did.</v>

465
00:21:39.940 --> 00:21:44.940
<v Speaker 3>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let's take this thing and feed it the </v>

466
00:21:44.940 --> 00:21:44.940
<v Speaker 3>picture of the panda and it says a giant</v>
<v Speaker 3>panda.</v>

467
00:21:44.940 --> 00:21:49.590
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>How about we do something more </v>

468
00:21:49.590 --> 00:21:49.590
<v Speaker 3>outrageous?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Let's take that neuron that.</v>

469
00:21:49.590 --> 00:21:52.570
<v Speaker 3>And let's only use the first,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let's say 10 layers of the neuron that.</v>

470
00:21:52.960 --> 00:21:56.530
<v Speaker 3>So let's just take out 10 layers of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>neuron that and feed it the panda.</v>

471
00:21:56.950 --> 00:22:00.700
<v Speaker 3>And now what we'll get is something from</v>
<v Speaker 3>the insides of the neuron that.</v>

472
00:22:01.090 --> 00:22:03.790
<v Speaker 3>And I could say for example,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let's just make those into images.</v>

473
00:22:03.791 --> 00:22:04.720
<v Speaker 3>Okay?</v>
<v Speaker 3>So that's what.</v>

474
00:22:04.900 --> 00:22:09.900
<v Speaker 3>That's what the neural net had figured </v>
<v Speaker 3>out about the panda after 10 layers of </v>

475
00:22:10.781 --> 00:22:13.840
<v Speaker 3>going through the neuron that and maybe </v>
<v Speaker 3>actually be interesting to see,</v>

476
00:22:13.841 --> 00:22:18.841
<v Speaker 3>let's do a feature space plots and now </v>
<v Speaker 3>we're going to have those intermediate </v>

477
00:22:19.360 --> 00:22:22.330
<v Speaker 3>things in the brain of the neural net so</v>
<v Speaker 3>to speak.</v>

478
00:22:22.590 --> 00:22:24.130
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is now taking.</v>

479
00:22:24.340 --> 00:22:29.340
<v Speaker 3>So what this is doing is to do dimension</v>
<v Speaker 3>reduction on this space of images.</v>

480
00:22:31.840 --> 00:22:36.840
<v Speaker 3>And so not very exciting.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's probabLy mostly distinguishing </v>

481
00:22:36.840 --> 00:22:36.840
<v Speaker 3>these by,</v>
<v Speaker 3>by total gray level,</v>

482
00:22:36.840 --> 00:22:38.470
<v Speaker 3>but that's kind of showing us the space </v>
<v Speaker 3>of,</v>

483
00:22:38.471 --> 00:22:40.020
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>of different term,</v>

484
00:22:40.390 --> 00:22:43.120
<v Speaker 3>a different sort of features of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>insides of the chanel on that.</v>

485
00:22:43.330 --> 00:22:48.330
<v Speaker 3>So it's also what's interesting to see </v>
<v Speaker 3>here is things like the symbolic </v>

486
00:22:48.330 --> 00:22:48.800
<v Speaker 3>representation of the neuron nets.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And if you,</v>

487
00:22:48.801 --> 00:22:50.800
<v Speaker 3>if you're wondering how does that </v>
<v Speaker 3>actually work inside,</v>

488
00:22:51.100 --> 00:22:54.580
<v Speaker 3>it's underneath it susan mx net,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which we happen to have contributed to a</v>

489
00:22:54.581 --> 00:22:58.960
<v Speaker 3>lot and there's sort of a bunch of </v>
<v Speaker 3>symbolic layers on top of that that feed</v>

490
00:22:58.961 --> 00:23:01.270
<v Speaker 3>into that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And maybe I can show you here,</v>

491
00:23:01.271 --> 00:23:06.271
<v Speaker 3>let,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let me show you how you would train one </v>

492
00:23:06.271 --> 00:23:06.271
<v Speaker 3>of these neural nets.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's also kind of fun.</v>

493
00:23:06.271 --> 00:23:09.820
<v Speaker 3>So we have a data repository that has </v>
<v Speaker 3>all sorts of useful data.</v>

494
00:23:10.120 --> 00:23:13.790
<v Speaker 3>One piece of data it has is a bunch of </v>
<v Speaker 3>neuron that training set.</v>

495
00:23:13.790 --> 00:23:18.790
<v Speaker 3>So this is the standard training set of </v>
<v Speaker 3>handwritten digits.</v>

496
00:23:19.060 --> 00:23:24.060
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So there's amnesty and you notice that </v>

497
00:23:24.060 --> 00:23:26.491
<v Speaker 3>these things here,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's Just an image which I could copy </v>

498
00:23:26.491 --> 00:23:28.480
<v Speaker 3>out and I could do,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let's say I could do color and a gate on</v>

499
00:23:28.481 --> 00:23:30.550
<v Speaker 3>that image because it's just an image.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

500
00:23:30.970 --> 00:23:32.830
<v Speaker 3>and there's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's the results and so on.</v>

501
00:23:33.190 --> 00:23:35.470
<v Speaker 3>And now I could say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let's take,</v>

502
00:23:35.530 --> 00:23:40.530
<v Speaker 3>let's take a neuron that like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let's take a simple neural net like </v>

503
00:23:40.530 --> 00:23:40.530
<v Speaker 3>lynette for example.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

504
00:23:40.530 --> 00:23:45.330
<v Speaker 3>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So let's take lanette and then let's </v>

505
00:23:45.330 --> 00:23:47.240
<v Speaker 3>take the untrained initial evaluation </v>
<v Speaker 3>network.</v>

506
00:23:47.241 --> 00:23:50.810
<v Speaker 3>So this is now a version of love,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that simple standard neuron that,</v>

507
00:23:51.110 --> 00:23:53.300
<v Speaker 3>that didn't get trained.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So for example,</v>

508
00:23:53.301 --> 00:23:54.500
<v Speaker 3>if I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if I take that,</v>

509
00:23:54.560 --> 00:23:59.560
<v Speaker 3>that symBolic representation of that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I could say net initialize than it </v>

510
00:23:59.811 --> 00:24:03.930
<v Speaker 3>will take that and it'll just put random</v>
<v Speaker 3>weights until the net.</v>

511
00:24:04.190 --> 00:24:04.380
<v Speaker 3>Okay?</v>

512
00:24:04.380 --> 00:24:08.030
<v Speaker 3>So if I take those random weights and I </v>
<v Speaker 3>feed it a zero here,</v>

513
00:24:08.330 --> 00:24:10.100
<v Speaker 3>I feed it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that image of a zero,</v>

514
00:24:10.370 --> 00:24:15.370
<v Speaker 3>it will presumaBly produced something </v>
<v Speaker 3>completely random and this particular </v>

515
00:24:15.370 --> 00:24:15.370
<v Speaker 3>case too,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

516
00:24:15.370 --> 00:24:20.170
<v Speaker 3>So now,</v>
<v Speaker 3>now what I would like to do is to take </v>

517
00:24:20.170 --> 00:24:22.841
<v Speaker 3>this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So thAt was just randomly initializing </v>

518
00:24:22.841 --> 00:24:22.841
<v Speaker 3>the weights.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So now what I'd like to do is to take,</v>

519
00:24:22.841 --> 00:24:27.580
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the training set and I'd like to </v>

520
00:24:27.580 --> 00:24:29.450
<v Speaker 3>actually train a learn at using eminence</v>
<v Speaker 3>training set.</v>

521
00:24:29.451 --> 00:24:34.451
<v Speaker 3>So let's take,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let's take this and let's take a random </v>

522
00:24:34.451 --> 00:24:37.220
<v Speaker 3>sample of a.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Let's say I don't know,</v>

523
00:24:37.221 --> 00:24:40.970
<v Speaker 3>a thousand pieces of lanette.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Come on.</v>

524
00:24:40.971 --> 00:24:42.560
<v Speaker 3>Why is it having to load it again?</v>
<v Speaker 3>There we go.</v>

525
00:24:42.561 --> 00:24:43.730
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So there's a,</v>

526
00:24:43.731 --> 00:24:46.680
<v Speaker 3>there's a random sample a was on line </v>
<v Speaker 3>21.</v>

527
00:24:46.681 --> 00:24:50.670
<v Speaker 3>And now let me go down here and say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

528
00:24:50.671 --> 00:24:52.940
<v Speaker 3>what was it?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well we can just take this,</v>

529
00:24:53.000 --> 00:24:54.020
<v Speaker 3>this thing here.</v>

530
00:24:54.350 --> 00:24:59.350
<v Speaker 3>So this is the uninitialized version of </v>
<v Speaker 3>lanette and we can say take that.</v>

531
00:25:00.050 --> 00:25:04.910
<v Speaker 3>And then let's say net train of that </v>
<v Speaker 3>with the thing on line 21,</v>

532
00:25:04.911 --> 00:25:09.911
<v Speaker 3>which was that thousand instances.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So now what it's doing is it's running </v>

533
00:25:09.911 --> 00:25:10.520
<v Speaker 3>training on,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

534
00:25:10.610 --> 00:25:13.310
<v Speaker 3>and that's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you see the loss going down and so on.</v>

535
00:25:13.610 --> 00:25:15.560
<v Speaker 3>It's running the training for,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

536
00:25:15.770 --> 00:25:18.380
<v Speaker 3>for those thousand instances of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>of uh,</v>

537
00:25:18.790 --> 00:25:20.480
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>lynette and it will,</v>

538
00:25:20.481 --> 00:25:22.490
<v Speaker 3>we can stop it if we want to.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Actually,</v>

539
00:25:22.491 --> 00:25:24.350
<v Speaker 3>this is a new display.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is very nice.</v>

540
00:25:24.560 --> 00:25:29.560
<v Speaker 3>This is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is a new version of language which </v>

541
00:25:29.560 --> 00:25:29.560
<v Speaker 3>is coming out next week,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which I'm showing you,</v>

542
00:25:29.560 --> 00:25:31.370
<v Speaker 3>But it's quite similar to what exists </v>
<v Speaker 3>today,</v>

543
00:25:31.400 --> 00:25:36.400
<v Speaker 3>but because that's one of the features </v>
<v Speaker 3>of running a software company is that </v>

544
00:25:36.400 --> 00:25:39.020
<v Speaker 3>you always run the very latest version </v>
<v Speaker 3>of things for better or worse.</v>

545
00:25:39.520 --> 00:25:44.520
<v Speaker 3>And that's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and this is also a good way to debug it </v>

546
00:25:44.520 --> 00:25:44.520
<v Speaker 3>was supposed to come out next week.</v>

547
00:25:44.520 --> 00:25:45.740
<v Speaker 3>If I find some horrifying bug,</v>
<v Speaker 3>maybe we'll get to later,</v>

548
00:25:46.520 --> 00:25:50.510
<v Speaker 3>but let's try and let's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

549
00:25:50.660 --> 00:25:52.520
<v Speaker 3>let's try this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay,</v>

550
00:25:52.550 --> 00:25:54.380
<v Speaker 3>now it says it's zero.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay?</v>

551
00:25:54.800 --> 00:25:59.800
<v Speaker 3>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so this is now a trained version of </v>

552
00:25:59.800 --> 00:25:59.800
<v Speaker 3>lynette trained with that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

553
00:25:59.800 --> 00:26:04.210
<v Speaker 3>with that training data.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm one of the things so we can talk </v>

554
00:26:04.210 --> 00:26:06.680
<v Speaker 3>about all kinds of details of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>of neural nets and so on.</v>

555
00:26:07.010 --> 00:26:09.950
<v Speaker 3>But maybe I should zoom out to talk a </v>
<v Speaker 3>little bit about bigger picture as it,</v>

556
00:26:09.951 --> 00:26:14.951
<v Speaker 3>as I see it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So one question is a sort of a question </v>

557
00:26:17.841 --> 00:26:21.050
<v Speaker 3>of what is in principle possible to do </v>
<v Speaker 3>with computation?</v>

558
00:26:21.440 --> 00:26:21.900
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

559
00:26:21.970 --> 00:26:23.690
<v Speaker 3>we have as we're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

560
00:26:23.691 --> 00:26:28.691
<v Speaker 3>we're building all kinds of things.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're making image identifiers were </v>

561
00:26:28.691 --> 00:26:32.050
<v Speaker 3>figuring out all kinds of things about </v>
<v Speaker 3>where the international space station </v>

562
00:26:32.050 --> 00:26:32.420
<v Speaker 3>is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so on question is what is,</v>

563
00:26:32.480 --> 00:26:34.970
<v Speaker 3>what is in principle possible to </v>
<v Speaker 3>compute?</v>

564
00:26:35.630 --> 00:26:37.310
<v Speaker 3>and so the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

565
00:26:37.600 --> 00:26:42.600
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>one of the places one can ask that </v>

566
00:26:42.600 --> 00:26:42.600
<v Speaker 3>question is when one looks at,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for example,</v>

567
00:26:42.600 --> 00:26:44.010
<v Speaker 3>models of the natural world can say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

568
00:26:44.011 --> 00:26:45.930
<v Speaker 3>how do we make models of the natural </v>
<v Speaker 3>world?</v>

569
00:26:46.170 --> 00:26:48.600
<v Speaker 3>Kind of a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a traditional approach has been,</v>

570
00:26:48.810 --> 00:26:51.900
<v Speaker 3>let's use mathematical equations to make</v>
<v Speaker 3>models of the natural world.</v>

571
00:26:52.180 --> 00:26:55.590
<v Speaker 3>A question is if we want to kind of </v>
<v Speaker 3>generalize that and say,</v>

572
00:26:55.591 --> 00:27:00.591
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what are all possible ways to make </v>

573
00:27:00.591 --> 00:27:00.591
<v Speaker 3>models of things?</v>
<v Speaker 3>What can we say about that question?</v>

574
00:27:00.840 --> 00:27:04.440
<v Speaker 3>So I spent many years in my lifetime to </v>
<v Speaker 3>address that question.</v>

575
00:27:04.890 --> 00:27:09.890
<v Speaker 3>And basically what I've thought about a </v>
<v Speaker 3>lot is that if you want to make a model </v>

576
00:27:10.291 --> 00:27:12.450
<v Speaker 3>of a thing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you have to have definite rules by which</v>

577
00:27:12.451 --> 00:27:15.510
<v Speaker 3>the thing operates.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What's the most general way to represent</v>

578
00:27:15.720 --> 00:27:19.260
<v Speaker 3>possible rules while in today's world we</v>
<v Speaker 3>think of that as a program.</v>

579
00:27:19.530 --> 00:27:20.640
<v Speaker 3>So the next question is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

580
00:27:20.641 --> 00:27:23.400
<v Speaker 3>what does the space of all possiBle </v>
<v Speaker 3>programs look like?</v>

581
00:27:23.940 --> 00:27:25.020
<v Speaker 3>And most of the time,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

582
00:27:25.040 --> 00:27:29.280
<v Speaker 3>we're writing programs like wolfram </v>
<v Speaker 3>language is 50 million lines of code and</v>

583
00:27:29.281 --> 00:27:33.780
<v Speaker 3>it's a big complicated program that was </v>
<v Speaker 3>for built for fairly specific purpose.</v>

584
00:27:34.080 --> 00:27:39.080
<v Speaker 3>But the question is if we just look At </v>
<v Speaker 3>sort of the space of possible programs </v>

585
00:27:39.080 --> 00:27:43.040
<v Speaker 3>more or less at random,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what's out there in the space of </v>

586
00:27:43.040 --> 00:27:45.111
<v Speaker 3>possible program.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I got an interest in many years ago </v>

587
00:27:45.111 --> 00:27:48.200
<v Speaker 3>in cellular automata,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which are really good example of a very </v>

588
00:27:48.200 --> 00:27:51.411
<v Speaker 3>simple kind of program.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So let me show you an example of one of </v>

589
00:27:51.411 --> 00:27:51.411
<v Speaker 3>these.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So this is,</v>

590
00:27:51.411 --> 00:27:53.880
<v Speaker 3>these are the rules for a typical </v>
<v Speaker 3>cellular automaton.</v>

591
00:27:54.210 --> 00:27:57.990
<v Speaker 3>And this just says you have a row of </v>
<v Speaker 3>black and white squares.</v>

592
00:27:58.230 --> 00:28:01.080
<v Speaker 3>And this just says,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you look at a black look at a square,</v>

593
00:28:01.200 --> 00:28:02.370
<v Speaker 3>say what color is that square?</v>

594
00:28:02.370 --> 00:28:07.370
<v Speaker 3>What color left left.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And right neighbors decide what color </v>

595
00:28:07.370 --> 00:28:08.460
<v Speaker 3>the square will be on the next step </v>
<v Speaker 3>based on that rule.</v>

596
00:28:08.610 --> 00:28:10.050
<v Speaker 3>Okay?</v>
<v Speaker 3>So really simple rule.</v>

597
00:28:10.350 --> 00:28:12.300
<v Speaker 3>So now let's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let's take a look at what,</v>

598
00:28:12.570 --> 00:28:17.570
<v Speaker 3>what actually happens if we use that </v>
<v Speaker 3>rule a bunch of times so we can take </v>

599
00:28:17.570 --> 00:28:18.240
<v Speaker 3>that rule.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The 2:54</v>

600
00:28:18.241 --> 00:28:23.241
<v Speaker 3>is just the binary digits that </v>
<v Speaker 3>correspond to those positions and this </v>

601
00:28:23.241 --> 00:28:25.020
<v Speaker 3>rule.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So now I can say this,</v>

602
00:28:25.021 --> 00:28:27.600
<v Speaker 3>I could say let's do 50 steps,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let me do this.</v>

603
00:28:28.080 --> 00:28:33.080
<v Speaker 3>And now if I run according to the rule I</v>
<v Speaker 3>just defined,</v>

604
00:28:33.570 --> 00:28:36.600
<v Speaker 3>it turns out to be pretty trivial.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's just sAying,</v>

605
00:28:36.880 --> 00:28:37.890
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if any,</v>

606
00:28:37.920 --> 00:28:40.650
<v Speaker 3>if any square is we start off with a </v>
<v Speaker 3>black square.</v>

607
00:28:40.651 --> 00:28:42.090
<v Speaker 3>If any square is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

608
00:28:42.390 --> 00:28:44.320
<v Speaker 3>if any neighbouring squares,</v>
<v Speaker 3>black makeup,</v>

609
00:28:44.330 --> 00:28:45.240
<v Speaker 3>black square.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So we've,</v>

610
00:28:45.390 --> 00:28:48.630
<v Speaker 3>we've used a very simple program,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we've got a very simple result out,</v>

611
00:28:49.050 --> 00:28:50.400
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let's try a different program.</v>

612
00:28:50.400 --> 00:28:55.350
<v Speaker 3>we can try changing this will get them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's a program with one bit different.</v>

613
00:28:55.980 --> 00:28:58.680
<v Speaker 3>Now we get that kind of pattern.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So the question is,</v>

614
00:28:58.681 --> 00:28:59.730
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what happens,</v>

615
00:28:59.910 --> 00:29:01.620
<v Speaker 3>you might say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

616
00:29:01.621 --> 00:29:03.870
<v Speaker 3>if you've got such a trivial program,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's not surprising,</v>

617
00:29:03.871 --> 00:29:05.430
<v Speaker 3>you're just going to get trevor results </v>
<v Speaker 3>out.</v>

618
00:29:06.000 --> 00:29:11.000
<v Speaker 3>So.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But you can do an experiment to test </v>

619
00:29:11.000 --> 00:29:13.161
<v Speaker 3>that hypothesis and you just say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let's take all possible programs that </v>

620
00:29:13.161 --> 00:29:16.080
<v Speaker 3>are 256 possible programs that are based</v>
<v Speaker 3>on these eight bits here.</v>

621
00:29:16.380 --> 00:29:18.240
<v Speaker 3>Let's just take bullets.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just,</v>

622
00:29:18.550 --> 00:29:20.520
<v Speaker 3>whoops,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let's just take come.</v>

623
00:29:21.930 --> 00:29:26.370
<v Speaker 3>Let's say the first 64 of those programs</v>
<v Speaker 3>and let's just make a.</v>

624
00:29:26.380 --> 00:29:31.380
<v Speaker 3>I'm a go.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Let's just make a table of the results </v>

625
00:29:31.651 --> 00:29:35.070
<v Speaker 3>that we get by running those first 64 </v>
<v Speaker 3>programs here.</v>

626
00:29:35.460 --> 00:29:38.370
<v Speaker 3>So here we get the result and what you </v>
<v Speaker 3>see is,</v>

627
00:29:38.400 --> 00:29:43.400
<v Speaker 3>well most of them are pretty trivial.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The likely they started with black cell </v>

628
00:29:43.400 --> 00:29:43.810
<v Speaker 3>in the middle and it just tools off to </v>
<v Speaker 3>one side.</v>

629
00:29:44.200 --> 00:29:46.120
<v Speaker 3>Occasionally we get something more </v>
<v Speaker 3>exciting happening.</v>

630
00:29:46.121 --> 00:29:48.250
<v Speaker 3>Like here's a nice nested pattern that </v>
<v Speaker 3>we get.</v>

631
00:29:48.520 --> 00:29:50.020
<v Speaker 3>We were to continue it longer.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It would,</v>

632
00:29:50.080 --> 00:29:55.080
<v Speaker 3>it would make a more detailed nesting.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But then my all time favorite science </v>

633
00:29:56.831 --> 00:30:01.831
<v Speaker 3>discovery.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you go on and just look at these </v>

634
00:30:01.831 --> 00:30:02.080
<v Speaker 3>after a while,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you find this one here,</v>

635
00:30:02.110 --> 00:30:05.830
<v Speaker 3>which is rule 30 and this in this </v>
<v Speaker 3>numbering scheme,</v>

636
00:30:06.100 --> 00:30:07.960
<v Speaker 3>and that's doing something a bit more </v>
<v Speaker 3>complicated.</v>

637
00:30:08.320 --> 00:30:08.770
<v Speaker 3>You say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

638
00:30:08.780 --> 00:30:10.060
<v Speaker 3>what's going on here?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

639
00:30:10.061 --> 00:30:12.070
<v Speaker 3>we just started off with this very </v>
<v Speaker 3>simple rule.</v>

640
00:30:12.280 --> 00:30:14.430
<v Speaker 3>LeT's see what happens.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Maybe after a while,</v>

641
00:30:14.630 --> 00:30:16.660
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if we run rule 30 long enough,</v>

642
00:30:16.930 --> 00:30:19.810
<v Speaker 3>it will resolve into something simpler.</v>
<v Speaker 3>SO let's try running it.</v>

643
00:30:19.811 --> 00:30:22.190
<v Speaker 3>Let's say 500 steps.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

644
00:30:22.810 --> 00:30:23.820
<v Speaker 3>and that's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whoops,</v>

645
00:30:23.830 --> 00:30:26.330
<v Speaker 3>that's the result we get.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Let's say a,</v>

646
00:30:28.750 --> 00:30:30.190
<v Speaker 3>just make it full screen.</v>

647
00:30:32.830 --> 00:30:37.830
<v Speaker 3>Okay?</v>
<v Speaker 3>So aliasing a bit on the project to the </v>

648
00:30:37.830 --> 00:30:37.830
<v Speaker 3>but,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but um,</v>

649
00:30:37.830 --> 00:30:38.380
<v Speaker 3>you've got the basic idea.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is a.</v>

650
00:30:38.580 --> 00:30:43.580
<v Speaker 3>So this just started off from one black </v>
<v Speaker 3>sell at the top and this is what it </v>

651
00:30:43.580 --> 00:30:47.101
<v Speaker 3>made.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that's pretty weird because all of </v>

652
00:30:47.101 --> 00:30:47.101
<v Speaker 3>this is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

653
00:30:47.101 --> 00:30:50.760
<v Speaker 3>this is a sort of not the way it's </v>
<v Speaker 3>supposed things are supposed to work </v>

654
00:30:50.760 --> 00:30:54.331
<v Speaker 3>because what we have here is just that </v>
<v Speaker 3>little program down there and it makes </v>

655
00:30:54.331 --> 00:30:58.981
<v Speaker 3>this big complicated pattern here.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And we can see there's a certain amount </v>

656
00:30:58.981 --> 00:31:00.100
<v Speaker 3>of regularity on one side,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but for example,</v>

657
00:31:00.101 --> 00:31:05.101
<v Speaker 3>the center column of this pattern is for</v>
<v Speaker 3>all practical purposes completely </v>

658
00:31:05.101 --> 00:31:05.101
<v Speaker 3>around.</v>
<v Speaker 3>In fact,</v>

659
00:31:05.101 --> 00:31:09.601
<v Speaker 3>it was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we used as the random number generator </v>

660
00:31:09.601 --> 00:31:09.820
<v Speaker 3>and mathematic or wolfram language for </v>
<v Speaker 3>many years.</v>

661
00:31:09.821 --> 00:31:13.570
<v Speaker 3>It was recently retired after,</v>
<v Speaker 3>after excellent service because we found</v>

662
00:31:13.571 --> 00:31:15.510
<v Speaker 3>it somewhat more efficient one,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

663
00:31:16.600 --> 00:31:17.200
<v Speaker 3>But,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

664
00:31:17.660 --> 00:31:19.360
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

665
00:31:19.361 --> 00:31:20.140
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so,</v>

666
00:31:20.200 --> 00:31:21.340
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what do we learn from this?</v>

667
00:31:21.340 --> 00:31:26.340
<v Speaker 3>What we learned from this is out in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>computational universe of possible </v>

668
00:31:26.340 --> 00:31:30.151
<v Speaker 3>programs.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's possible to get even with very </v>

669
00:31:30.151 --> 00:31:30.220
<v Speaker 3>simple programs,</v>
<v Speaker 3>very rich,</v>

670
00:31:30.221 --> 00:31:32.710
<v Speaker 3>complicated behavior.</v>
<v Speaker 3>While that's important,</v>

671
00:31:32.711 --> 00:31:37.711
<v Speaker 3>if you're interested in modeling the </v>
<v Speaker 3>natural world because you might think </v>

672
00:31:37.711 --> 00:31:41.580
<v Speaker 3>that there are programs that represent </v>
<v Speaker 3>systems in nature that might work this </v>

673
00:31:41.580 --> 00:31:45.421
<v Speaker 3>way and so on.</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's also important for technology </v>

674
00:31:45.421 --> 00:31:45.421
<v Speaker 3>because it says,</v>
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

675
00:31:45.421 --> 00:31:47.950
<v Speaker 3>let's say you're trying to find a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

676
00:31:48.250 --> 00:31:53.250
<v Speaker 3>let's say you're trying to find a </v>
<v Speaker 3>Program that's a good random number </v>

677
00:31:53.250 --> 00:31:53.250
<v Speaker 3>generator.</v>
<v Speaker 3>How are you going to do that?</v>

678
00:31:53.250 --> 00:31:55.000
<v Speaker 3>While you could start thinking very hard</v>
<v Speaker 3>and you could try and make up,</v>

679
00:31:55.030 --> 00:32:00.030
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can try and write down all kinds of </v>

680
00:32:00.030 --> 00:32:02.191
<v Speaker 3>flow charts about how this random number</v>
<v Speaker 3>generator is going to work or you can </v>

681
00:32:02.191 --> 00:32:02.260
<v Speaker 3>say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>forget that I'm just going to search the</v>

682
00:32:02.261 --> 00:32:07.261
<v Speaker 3>computational universe of possible </v>
<v Speaker 3>programs and just look for one that </v>

683
00:32:07.261 --> 00:32:09.040
<v Speaker 3>serves as a good random numBer generator</v>
<v Speaker 3>and this particular case,</v>

684
00:32:09.041 --> 00:32:12.640
<v Speaker 3>after you've searched 30 programs,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you'll find one that makes a good random</v>

685
00:32:12.641 --> 00:32:13.420
<v Speaker 3>number generator.</v>

686
00:32:13.720 --> 00:32:16.480
<v Speaker 3>Why dOes it work?</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's a complicated story.</v>

687
00:32:16.720 --> 00:32:21.720
<v Speaker 3>It's not a story that I think </v>
<v Speaker 3>necessarily we can really tell very </v>

688
00:32:21.720 --> 00:32:25.501
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but what's important is that this is </v>

689
00:32:25.501 --> 00:32:25.630
<v Speaker 3>this idea that out in the computational </v>
<v Speaker 3>universe,</v>

690
00:32:25.631 --> 00:32:30.631
<v Speaker 3>there's a lot of rich,</v>
<v Speaker 3>sophisticated stuff that can be </v>

691
00:32:30.631 --> 00:32:32.530
<v Speaker 3>essentially mined for our technological </v>
<v Speaker 3>purposes.</v>

692
00:32:32.531 --> 00:32:37.531
<v Speaker 3>That's the important thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Whether we understand how this works is </v>

693
00:32:37.531 --> 00:32:41.821
<v Speaker 3>a different matter.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean it's like when we look at the </v>

694
00:32:41.821 --> 00:32:41.821
<v Speaker 3>natural world,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the physical world,</v>

695
00:32:41.821 --> 00:32:42.530
<v Speaker 3>we're used to kind of mining things.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

696
00:32:42.710 --> 00:32:47.150
<v Speaker 3>we started using magnets to do magnetic </v>
<v Speaker 3>stuff long before we understand,</v>

697
00:32:47.180 --> 00:32:49.730
<v Speaker 3>understood the theory of pharaoh </v>
<v Speaker 3>mannerism and so on.</v>

698
00:32:50.030 --> 00:32:55.030
<v Speaker 3>And so similarly here we can sort of go </v>
<v Speaker 3>out into the computational universe and </v>

699
00:32:55.030 --> 00:32:57.680
<v Speaker 3>find stuff that's useful for our </v>
<v Speaker 3>purposes now.</v>

700
00:32:57.950 --> 00:32:59.190
<v Speaker 3>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

701
00:32:59.280 --> 00:33:04.280
<v Speaker 3>the world of sort of deep learning and </v>
<v Speaker 3>neural nets and so on as a little bit </v>

702
00:33:04.280 --> 00:33:05.090
<v Speaker 3>like this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it uses the trick that there's a certain</v>

703
00:33:05.091 --> 00:33:10.091
<v Speaker 3>degree of differentiability there so you</v>
<v Speaker 3>can kind of home in on let's try and </v>

704
00:33:10.091 --> 00:33:12.980
<v Speaker 3>find something that's incrementally </v>
<v Speaker 3>better and for certain kinds of problems</v>

705
00:33:12.981 --> 00:33:14.150
<v Speaker 3>that works pretty well.</v>

706
00:33:14.510 --> 00:33:19.510
<v Speaker 3>I think the thing that we've done a lot,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've done a lot is just sort of </v>

707
00:33:19.510 --> 00:33:21.440
<v Speaker 3>exhaustive search and the computational </v>
<v Speaker 3>universe of possible programs,</v>

708
00:33:21.441 --> 00:33:26.441
<v Speaker 3>just such a trillion programs and try </v>
<v Speaker 3>and find one that does something </v>

709
00:33:26.441 --> 00:33:26.760
<v Speaker 3>interesting and useful for you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

710
00:33:27.380 --> 00:33:29.720
<v Speaker 3>there's a lot of things to say about </v>
<v Speaker 3>what,</v>

711
00:33:29.721 --> 00:33:30.970
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what actually in,</v>

712
00:33:30.971 --> 00:33:33.680
<v Speaker 3>in the such a chilean programs and find </v>
<v Speaker 3>one that's useful.</v>

713
00:33:33.860 --> 00:33:36.380
<v Speaker 3>Let me show you another example of that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

714
00:33:36.500 --> 00:33:41.360
<v Speaker 3>let's see.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I was interested in awhile ago in um,</v>

715
00:33:41.960 --> 00:33:42.980
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

716
00:33:42.981 --> 00:33:44.570
<v Speaker 3>I have to look something up here.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Sorry,</v>

717
00:33:44.910 --> 00:33:48.440
<v Speaker 3>I'm in.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm a see,</v>

718
00:33:49.190 --> 00:33:54.190
<v Speaker 3>I'm in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm a boolean algebra and in,</v>

719
00:33:55.150 --> 00:33:56.280
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

720
00:33:56.320 --> 00:33:59.140
<v Speaker 3>it was interested in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in the space of all possible mathematics</v>

721
00:33:59.141 --> 00:34:00.470
<v Speaker 3>says,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

722
00:34:01.040 --> 00:34:02.580
<v Speaker 3>and ah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let me just see here.</v>

723
00:34:03.230 --> 00:34:07.970
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not finding what I wanted to find.</v>

724
00:34:07.971 --> 00:34:09.920
<v Speaker 3>Sorry,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

725
00:34:09.960 --> 00:34:14.960
<v Speaker 3>was a good example.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I should have memorized this but I </v>

726
00:34:14.960 --> 00:34:14.990
<v Speaker 3>haven't.</v>

727
00:34:15.020 --> 00:34:17.330
<v Speaker 3>So I'm.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Here we go.</v>

728
00:34:17.930 --> 00:34:19.120
<v Speaker 3>There it is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

729
00:34:20.810 --> 00:34:25.070
<v Speaker 3>so I was interested in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you just look at.</v>

730
00:34:25.071 --> 00:34:29.000
<v Speaker 3>So we talked about sort of looking at </v>
<v Speaker 3>the space of all possible,</v>

731
00:34:29.330 --> 00:34:30.820
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

732
00:34:32.240 --> 00:34:37.240
<v Speaker 3>the space of all possible programs.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Another thing you can do is say if </v>

733
00:34:37.240 --> 00:34:37.580
<v Speaker 3>you're going to invent mathematics from </v>
<v Speaker 3>nothing,</v>

734
00:34:37.970 --> 00:34:40.550
<v Speaker 3>what possible axiom systems could be </v>
<v Speaker 3>used in mathematics.</v>

735
00:34:40.551 --> 00:34:45.551
<v Speaker 3>So I was curious where do that again </v>
<v Speaker 3>might seem like a completely crazy thing</v>

736
00:34:46.191 --> 00:34:47.450
<v Speaker 3>to do.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So just say,</v>

737
00:34:47.451 --> 00:34:50.870
<v Speaker 3>let's just start enumerating axiom </v>
<v Speaker 3>systems at random and see if we find one</v>

738
00:34:50.871 --> 00:34:55.871
<v Speaker 3>that's interesting and useful,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it turns out once you have this idea</v>

739
00:34:56.030 --> 00:34:58.760
<v Speaker 3>that out in the computational universe </v>
<v Speaker 3>of possible programs,</v>

740
00:34:59.090 --> 00:35:01.700
<v Speaker 3>that's actually a lot of low hanging </v>
<v Speaker 3>fruit to be found.</v>

741
00:35:02.030 --> 00:35:04.250
<v Speaker 3>It turns out you can apply that in lots </v>
<v Speaker 3>of places.</v>

742
00:35:04.251 --> 00:35:05.930
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the thing to understand is why?</v>

743
00:35:06.110 --> 00:35:09.020
<v Speaker 3>Why do we not see a lot of engineering </v>
<v Speaker 3>structures that look like this?</v>

744
00:35:09.021 --> 00:35:14.021
<v Speaker 3>The reason is because our traditional </v>
<v Speaker 3>model of engineering has been we </v>

745
00:35:14.021 --> 00:35:18.581
<v Speaker 3>engineer things in a way where we were,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we can foresee what the outcome of our </v>

746
00:35:18.581 --> 00:35:22.241
<v Speaker 3>engineering steps that are going to be </v>
<v Speaker 3>and when it comes to something like </v>

747
00:35:22.241 --> 00:35:26.111
<v Speaker 3>this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we can find it out in the computational </v>

748
00:35:26.111 --> 00:35:26.111
<v Speaker 3>universe what we can't readily foresee,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what's going to happen.</v>

749
00:35:26.111 --> 00:35:29.600
<v Speaker 3>We can't do Sort of a step by step </v>
<v Speaker 3>design of this particular thing.</v>

750
00:35:29.601 --> 00:35:34.601
<v Speaker 3>And so in engineering and human </v>
<v Speaker 3>engineering as it's been practiced so </v>

751
00:35:34.601 --> 00:35:38.141
<v Speaker 3>far,</v>
<v Speaker 3>most of it has consisted of building </v>

752
00:35:38.141 --> 00:35:40.180
<v Speaker 3>things where we can foresee step by step</v>
<v Speaker 3>what the outcome of our engineering it's</v>

753
00:35:40.190 --> 00:35:41.850
<v Speaker 3>going to be.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And we see that in programs,</v>

754
00:35:42.000 --> 00:35:47.000
<v Speaker 3>we see that in in other kinds of </v>
<v Speaker 3>engineering structures and so there's </v>

755
00:35:47.000 --> 00:35:50.901
<v Speaker 3>sort of a different kind of engineering </v>
<v Speaker 3>which is about mining the computational </v>

756
00:35:50.901 --> 00:35:54.021
<v Speaker 3>universe of possible programs and it's </v>
<v Speaker 3>worth realizing there's a lot more that </v>

757
00:35:54.021 --> 00:35:58.671
<v Speaker 3>can be done a lot more efficiently by </v>
<v Speaker 3>mining the computational universe of </v>

758
00:35:58.671 --> 00:36:02.061
<v Speaker 3>possible programs than by just </v>
<v Speaker 3>constructing things step by step as a </v>

759
00:36:02.061 --> 00:36:02.061
<v Speaker 3>human.</v>

760
00:36:02.061 --> 00:36:05.660
<v Speaker 3>So for example,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you look for optimal algorithms for </v>

761
00:36:05.660 --> 00:36:05.660
<v Speaker 3>things like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know,</v>

762
00:36:05.660 --> 00:36:09.441
<v Speaker 3>even something like sorting networks,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the optimal sorting networks look very </v>

763
00:36:09.441 --> 00:36:14.091
<v Speaker 3>complicated.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're not things that you would </v>

764
00:36:14.091 --> 00:36:16.040
<v Speaker 3>construct by sort of step by step </v>
<v Speaker 3>thinking about things with a in a kind </v>

765
00:36:16.801 --> 00:36:21.750
<v Speaker 3>of a in a kind of typical human way.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so this,</v>

766
00:36:21.770 --> 00:36:22.950
<v Speaker 3>this idea,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

767
00:36:23.040 --> 00:36:25.680
<v Speaker 3>if you're really going to have </v>
<v Speaker 3>computation work efficiently,</v>

768
00:36:25.890 --> 00:36:30.890
<v Speaker 3>you are going to end up with these </v>
<v Speaker 3>programs that are sort of just mined </v>

769
00:36:30.890 --> 00:36:34.640
<v Speaker 3>from the computational universe and one </v>
<v Speaker 3>of the issues with mining thing so that </v>

770
00:36:34.640 --> 00:36:39.290
<v Speaker 3>there this makes use of computation much</v>
<v Speaker 3>more efficiently than a typical thing </v>

771
00:36:39.361 --> 00:36:40.380
<v Speaker 3>that we might construct.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now,</v>

772
00:36:40.381 --> 00:36:45.381
<v Speaker 3>one feature of this is it's hard to </v>
<v Speaker 3>understand what's going on and there's </v>

773
00:36:45.381 --> 00:36:48.891
<v Speaker 3>actually a fundamental reason for that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is in our efforts to sort of </v>

774
00:36:48.891 --> 00:36:52.371
<v Speaker 3>understand what's going on,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we get to use our brains are computers </v>

775
00:36:52.371 --> 00:36:54.690
<v Speaker 3>are mathematics or whatever and our goal</v>
<v Speaker 3>is this,</v>

776
00:36:54.870 --> 00:36:59.870
<v Speaker 3>this particular little program that a </v>
<v Speaker 3>certain amount of computation to work </v>

777
00:36:59.870 --> 00:36:59.870
<v Speaker 3>out this pattern.</v>

778
00:36:59.870 --> 00:37:02.670
<v Speaker 3>The question is can we kind of outrun </v>
<v Speaker 3>that computation and say,</v>

779
00:37:02.880 --> 00:37:05.340
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I can tell that actually this particular</v>

780
00:37:05.341 --> 00:37:08.760
<v Speaker 3>bit down here is going to be a black </v>
<v Speaker 3>black bit a.</v>

781
00:37:08.870 --> 00:37:10.860
<v Speaker 3>You don't have to go and do all that </v>
<v Speaker 3>computation.</v>

782
00:37:11.280 --> 00:37:13.620
<v Speaker 3>But it turns out that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and again,</v>

783
00:37:13.621 --> 00:37:15.480
<v Speaker 3>this will maybe as a digression,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which,</v>

784
00:37:15.540 --> 00:37:16.080
<v Speaker 3>which,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

785
00:37:16.350 --> 00:37:19.440
<v Speaker 3>there's this phenomenon I called </v>
<v Speaker 3>computational irresponsibility,</v>

786
00:37:19.650 --> 00:37:24.650
<v Speaker 3>which I think is really common and it's </v>
<v Speaker 3>a consequence of this thing I call </v>

787
00:37:24.650 --> 00:37:27.631
<v Speaker 3>principle of computational equivalence.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that the principle of computational </v>

788
00:37:27.631 --> 00:37:31.701
<v Speaker 3>equivalents basically says as soon as </v>
<v Speaker 3>you have a system whose behavior isn't </v>

789
00:37:31.701 --> 00:37:36.411
<v Speaker 3>fairly easy to analyze,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the chances are that the computation </v>

790
00:37:36.411 --> 00:37:37.950
<v Speaker 3>it's doing is essentially as </v>
<v Speaker 3>sophisticated as it could be.</v>

791
00:37:38.460 --> 00:37:43.460
<v Speaker 3>And That has consequences.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like it implies that the typical thing </v>

792
00:37:43.460 --> 00:37:46.910
<v Speaker 3>like this will correspond to a universal</v>
<v Speaker 3>computer that you can use to program and</v>

793
00:37:46.911 --> 00:37:47.250
<v Speaker 3>a thing.</v>

794
00:37:47.400 --> 00:37:52.400
<v Speaker 3>It also has the consequence of this </v>
<v Speaker 3>computational reducibility phenomenon </v>

795
00:37:52.400 --> 00:37:55.910
<v Speaker 3>that says you can't expect our brains to</v>
<v Speaker 3>be able to outrun the computations that </v>

796
00:37:55.910 --> 00:38:00.741
<v Speaker 3>are going on inside the system.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If there was computational reduce </v>

797
00:38:00.741 --> 00:38:04.151
<v Speaker 3>ability,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then we can expect that this thing went </v>

798
00:38:04.151 --> 00:38:04.860
<v Speaker 3>to a lot of trouble and did a million </v>
<v Speaker 3>steps of evolution.</v>

799
00:38:05.070 --> 00:38:10.070
<v Speaker 3>But actually just by using our brains,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we can jump ahead and see what the </v>

800
00:38:10.070 --> 00:38:13.521
<v Speaker 3>answer will be.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Computational irreducible suggest that </v>

801
00:38:13.521 --> 00:38:16.281
<v Speaker 3>isn't the case.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If we're going to make the most </v>

802
00:38:16.281 --> 00:38:16.281
<v Speaker 3>efficient use of computational </v>
<v Speaker 3>resources,</v>

803
00:38:16.281 --> 00:38:20.990
<v Speaker 3>we will inevitably run into </v>
<v Speaker 3>computational irritability all over the </v>

804
00:38:20.990 --> 00:38:24.051
<v Speaker 3>place.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It has the consequence that we get the </v>

805
00:38:24.051 --> 00:38:27.141
<v Speaker 3>situation where we can't readily sort of</v>
<v Speaker 3>foresee and understand what's going to </v>

806
00:38:27.141 --> 00:38:28.410
<v Speaker 3>happen.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So back to mathematics for a second.</v>

807
00:38:28.620 --> 00:38:31.390
<v Speaker 3>so this is just an axiom system,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

808
00:38:31.560 --> 00:38:32.310
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

809
00:38:32.640 --> 00:38:37.640
<v Speaker 3>so I looked for all possible look </v>
<v Speaker 3>through sort of all possible axiom </v>

810
00:38:37.640 --> 00:38:38.890
<v Speaker 3>systems starting off with the really </v>
<v Speaker 3>tiny ones.</v>

811
00:38:38.890 --> 00:38:43.890
<v Speaker 3>And I asked the question,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what's the first axiom system that </v>

812
00:38:43.890 --> 00:38:45.570
<v Speaker 3>corresponds to boolean algebra?</v>
<v Speaker 3>so it turns out this,</v>

813
00:38:45.571 --> 00:38:47.680
<v Speaker 3>this thing here,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this tiny little thing here,</v>

814
00:38:48.230 --> 00:38:50.760
<v Speaker 3>a generates all theorems of boolean </v>
<v Speaker 3>algebra does it.</v>

815
00:38:50.761 --> 00:38:53.020
<v Speaker 3>It is the simplest axiom for boolean </v>
<v Speaker 3>algebra.</v>

816
00:38:53.470 --> 00:38:58.470
<v Speaker 3>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 3>something I have to show you this </v>

817
00:38:58.470 --> 00:38:58.470
<v Speaker 3>because it's a new feature.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You see the,</v>

818
00:38:58.810 --> 00:39:03.810
<v Speaker 3>if I say find equational proof,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let's say I want to prove commuter </v>

819
00:39:03.810 --> 00:39:06.640
<v Speaker 3>activity of the nand operation.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to show you something here.</v>

820
00:39:07.000 --> 00:39:10.390
<v Speaker 3>This is going to try to generate,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let's see if this works.</v>

821
00:39:10.820 --> 00:39:15.820
<v Speaker 3>And this is going to try to generate an </v>
<v Speaker 3>automated proof based on that axiom </v>

822
00:39:15.820 --> 00:39:19.090
<v Speaker 3>system of that result.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it had 102 steps and the proof.</v>

823
00:39:19.540 --> 00:39:21.760
<v Speaker 3>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let's try and say,</v>

824
00:39:21.761 --> 00:39:22.960
<v Speaker 3>let's look at,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for example,</v>

825
00:39:22.961 --> 00:39:24.820
<v Speaker 3>the proof network here.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Actually,</v>

826
00:39:24.821 --> 00:39:27.270
<v Speaker 3>let's look at the proof dataset.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

827
00:39:27.420 --> 00:39:28.780
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's not what I wanted.</v>

828
00:39:29.720 --> 00:39:31.070
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I should learn how to use the,</v>

829
00:39:31.970 --> 00:39:34.410
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

830
00:39:36.900 --> 00:39:40.520
<v Speaker 3>let's see what I want is the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

831
00:39:41.390 --> 00:39:42.610
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>proof dataset.</v>

832
00:39:42.611 --> 00:39:43.720
<v Speaker 3>There we go.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Very good.</v>

833
00:39:44.230 --> 00:39:47.470
<v Speaker 3>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so this is actually,</v>

834
00:39:47.471 --> 00:39:48.460
<v Speaker 3>let's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let's say,</v>

835
00:39:48.920 --> 00:39:49.720
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>first of all,</v>

836
00:39:49.721 --> 00:39:51.970
<v Speaker 3>let's say the proof graph.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay?</v>

837
00:39:51.971 --> 00:39:55.480
<v Speaker 3>So this is going to show me the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how that proof was done.</v>

838
00:39:55.540 --> 00:39:59.650
<v Speaker 3>So there are a bunch of lemons that got </v>
<v Speaker 3>approved and from those lemars,</v>

839
00:39:59.651 --> 00:40:02.320
<v Speaker 3>those cameras were combined that </v>
<v Speaker 3>eventually approved the result.</v>

840
00:40:02.890 --> 00:40:04.080
<v Speaker 3>So let's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let's take a look at the.</v>

841
00:40:04.120 --> 00:40:05.980
<v Speaker 3>Let's take a look at what some of those </v>
<v Speaker 3>lenders where,</v>

842
00:40:08.560 --> 00:40:09.340
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so here's,</v>

843
00:40:09.370 --> 00:40:11.260
<v Speaker 3>here's the result.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So after,</v>

844
00:40:11.261 --> 00:40:14.050
<v Speaker 3>so it goes through and these are various</v>
<v Speaker 3>lemars it's using,</v>

845
00:40:14.051 --> 00:40:18.550
<v Speaker 3>and eventually after many pages of </v>
<v Speaker 3>nonsense it will get to the result.</v>

846
00:40:18.820 --> 00:40:19.780
<v Speaker 3>Okay?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Each one of these,</v>

847
00:40:19.781 --> 00:40:21.410
<v Speaker 3>some of these llamas are kind of </v>
<v Speaker 3>complicated.</v>

848
00:40:21.411 --> 00:40:22.340
<v Speaker 3>The,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's uh,</v>

849
00:40:22.420 --> 00:40:23.330
<v Speaker 3>that's that lama.</v>

850
00:40:23.400 --> 00:40:25.800
<v Speaker 3>It's a pretty complicated lemme etc.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Etc.</v>

851
00:40:25.870 --> 00:40:30.870
<v Speaker 3>Etc.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So you might ask what on earth is going </v>

852
00:40:30.870 --> 00:40:30.870
<v Speaker 3>on here?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And the answer is,</v>

853
00:40:30.870 --> 00:40:34.741
<v Speaker 3>so I first generated version of this </v>
<v Speaker 3>proof 20 years ago and I tried to </v>

854
00:40:34.741 --> 00:40:38.191
<v Speaker 3>understand what was going on and I </v>
<v Speaker 3>completely failed and it's sort of </v>

855
00:40:38.191 --> 00:40:39.360
<v Speaker 3>embarrassing because this is supposed to</v>
<v Speaker 3>be approved for.</v>

856
00:40:39.361 --> 00:40:40.420
<v Speaker 3>It's supposed to be,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

857
00:40:40.421 --> 00:40:44.380
<v Speaker 3>demonstrating some results.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And what we realize is that,</v>

858
00:40:44.650 --> 00:40:49.650
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what does it mean to have a proof of </v>

859
00:40:49.650 --> 00:40:49.650
<v Speaker 3>something?</v>
<v Speaker 3>What does it mean to explain how a thing</v>

860
00:40:49.650 --> 00:40:50.460
<v Speaker 3>is done?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

861
00:40:50.510 --> 00:40:55.510
<v Speaker 3>what,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what is the purpose of a proof sort of </v>

862
00:40:55.510 --> 00:40:56.170
<v Speaker 3>proof is basically to let humans </v>
<v Speaker 3>understand why something is true.</v>

863
00:40:56.740 --> 00:40:58.570
<v Speaker 3>And so for example,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you go to,</v>

864
00:40:58.571 --> 00:41:02.350
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let's say we go to wolf alpha and we do,</v>

865
00:41:02.890 --> 00:41:07.890
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>some random thing where we say let's do </v>

866
00:41:07.890 --> 00:41:10.360
<v Speaker 3>an integral of something or another,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it will be able to very quickly.</v>

867
00:41:10.630 --> 00:41:15.630
<v Speaker 3>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it Will take it one milliseconds </v>

868
00:41:15.630 --> 00:41:15.630
<v Speaker 3>internally to work out the answer to </v>
<v Speaker 3>that integral,</v>

869
00:41:15.630 --> 00:41:17.620
<v Speaker 3>okay?</v>
<v Speaker 3>But then somebody who's wants to hand in</v>

870
00:41:17.621 --> 00:41:19.240
<v Speaker 3>a piece of homework or something like </v>
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>

871
00:41:19.480 --> 00:41:22.810
<v Speaker 3>needs to explain why is this true?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay,</v>

872
00:41:23.200 --> 00:41:26.560
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we have this handy step by step solution</v>

873
00:41:27.040 --> 00:41:32.040
<v Speaker 3>thing here,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which explains why it's true.</v>

874
00:41:32.500 --> 00:41:37.500
<v Speaker 3>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the thing I should admit about the step </v>

875
00:41:37.500 --> 00:41:37.500
<v Speaker 3>by step solutIon is it's completely </v>
<v Speaker 3>fake.</v>

876
00:41:37.500 --> 00:41:40.250
<v Speaker 3>That is the steps that are described in </v>
<v Speaker 3>the step by step solution.</v>

877
00:41:40.251 --> 00:41:42.980
<v Speaker 3>I have absolutely nothing to do with the</v>
<v Speaker 3>way that internally,</v>

878
00:41:42.981 --> 00:41:47.981
<v Speaker 3>that integral was computed.</v>
<v Speaker 3>These are steps created purely for the </v>

879
00:41:47.981 --> 00:41:51.230
<v Speaker 3>purpose of telling a story to humans </v>
<v Speaker 3>about why the center came out the way it</v>

880
00:41:51.231 --> 00:41:54.250
<v Speaker 3>did and now what we're seeing and so </v>
<v Speaker 3>that's a.</v>

881
00:41:54.380 --> 00:41:56.030
<v Speaker 3>So that's one thing is knowing the </v>
<v Speaker 3>answer.</v>

882
00:41:56.031 --> 00:42:01.031
<v Speaker 3>The other thing is being able to tell a </v>
<v Speaker 3>story about why the answer work that </v>

883
00:42:01.031 --> 00:42:01.031
<v Speaker 3>way.</v>

884
00:42:01.031 --> 00:42:02.420
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what we see here is this is a proof,</v>

885
00:42:02.930 --> 00:42:07.930
<v Speaker 3>but it was an automatically generated </v>
<v Speaker 3>proof and it's a really lousy story for </v>

886
00:42:07.930 --> 00:42:11.951
<v Speaker 3>us humans.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean if it turned out that one of </v>

887
00:42:11.951 --> 00:42:14.801
<v Speaker 3>these theorems here was one that had </v>
<v Speaker 3>been proved by gauss or something and </v>

888
00:42:14.801 --> 00:42:16.790
<v Speaker 3>appeared in all the textbooks,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we wouldn't be much happier because then</v>

889
00:42:16.791 --> 00:42:21.230
<v Speaker 3>we would start to have a kind of human </v>
<v Speaker 3>representable story about what was going</v>

890
00:42:21.231 --> 00:42:26.231
<v Speaker 3>on.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Instead we just get a bunch of machine </v>

891
00:42:26.231 --> 00:42:27.791
<v Speaker 3>generated Lammas that we can't </v>
<v Speaker 3>understand that we can't kind of wrap </v>

892
00:42:27.791 --> 00:42:30.560
<v Speaker 3>our brains around and it's sorta the </v>
<v Speaker 3>same thing that's going on in.</v>

893
00:42:30.880 --> 00:42:33.530
<v Speaker 3>When we look at when is neuron that's </v>
<v Speaker 3>we're seeing,</v>

894
00:42:33.531 --> 00:42:34.460
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when we were looking,</v>

895
00:42:34.461 --> 00:42:37.100
<v Speaker 3>wherever it was at the innards of that </v>
<v Speaker 3>neuron that.</v>

896
00:42:37.370 --> 00:42:38.150
<v Speaker 3>And we say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

897
00:42:38.151 --> 00:42:40.580
<v Speaker 3>how is it figuring out that that's a </v>
<v Speaker 3>picture of a panda?</v>

898
00:42:40.910 --> 00:42:43.250
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the answer is it decided that,</v>

899
00:42:43.420 --> 00:42:45.140
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if we humans were saying,</v>

900
00:42:45.141 --> 00:42:46.940
<v Speaker 3>how would you figure out if it's a </v>
<v Speaker 3>picture of a panda,</v>

901
00:42:46.941 --> 00:42:50.030
<v Speaker 3>we might say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well look and see if it has eyes.</v>

902
00:42:50.031 --> 00:42:55.031
<v Speaker 3>That's a clue for whether it's an animal</v>
<v Speaker 3>look and see if it's looks like it's </v>

903
00:42:55.031 --> 00:42:58.151
<v Speaker 3>kind of round and furry and things </v>
<v Speaker 3>that's a version of whether it's a </v>

904
00:42:58.151 --> 00:42:58.390
<v Speaker 3>pander and et cetera,</v>
<v Speaker 3>et cetera,</v>

905
00:42:58.391 --> 00:43:03.391
<v Speaker 3>et cetera.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But what it's doing is it learned to a </v>

906
00:43:03.391 --> 00:43:03.391
<v Speaker 3>bunch of criteria for,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

907
00:43:03.391 --> 00:43:04.880
<v Speaker 3>is it a pandora?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Is it one of 10,000</v>

908
00:43:04.881 --> 00:43:06.860
<v Speaker 3>other possible things that it could have</v>
<v Speaker 3>recognized?</v>

909
00:43:07.130 --> 00:43:12.130
<v Speaker 3>And it learns those criteria in a way </v>
<v Speaker 3>that was somehow optimal based on the </v>

910
00:43:12.130 --> 00:43:16.991
<v Speaker 3>training that it got and so on.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But it learned things which were </v>

911
00:43:16.991 --> 00:43:19.751
<v Speaker 3>distinctions which are different from </v>
<v Speaker 3>the distinctions that we humans make in </v>

912
00:43:19.751 --> 00:43:20.930
<v Speaker 3>the language that we as humans use.</v>

913
00:43:21.170 --> 00:43:22.940
<v Speaker 3>And so in some sense,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

914
00:43:22.941 --> 00:43:24.590
<v Speaker 3>when,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when we start talking about,</v>

915
00:43:24.591 --> 00:43:25.850
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>describe a picture,</v>

916
00:43:26.090 --> 00:43:28.700
<v Speaker 3>we have a certain human language for </v>
<v Speaker 3>describing that picture.</v>

917
00:43:28.910 --> 00:43:31.790
<v Speaker 3>We have in our human,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in typical human languages,</v>

918
00:43:32.000 --> 00:43:35.570
<v Speaker 3>we have maybe 30 to 50,000</v>
<v Speaker 3>words that we use to describe things.</v>

919
00:43:35.840 --> 00:43:40.840
<v Speaker 3>Those words are words that have sort of </v>
<v Speaker 3>evolved as being useful for describing </v>

920
00:43:40.840 --> 00:43:44.360
<v Speaker 3>the world that we live in when it comes </v>
<v Speaker 3>to this neural net.</v>

921
00:43:44.600 --> 00:43:46.610
<v Speaker 3>It could be using,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it could say,</v>

922
00:43:46.611 --> 00:43:47.640
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

923
00:43:47.730 --> 00:43:50.210
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the words that it is effectively learnt,</v>

924
00:43:50.540 --> 00:43:53.900
<v Speaker 3>which allow it to make distinctions </v>
<v Speaker 3>about what's going on in the,</v>

925
00:43:54.170 --> 00:43:59.170
<v Speaker 3>in the analysis that it's doing it as </v>
<v Speaker 3>effectively invented words that describe</v>

926
00:43:59.961 --> 00:44:04.961
<v Speaker 3>distinctions,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but those words have nothing to do with </v>

927
00:44:04.961 --> 00:44:05.960
<v Speaker 3>our historically invented words that </v>
<v Speaker 3>exist in our languages.</v>

928
00:44:06.110 --> 00:44:07.910
<v Speaker 3>So it's kind of an interesting situation</v>
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>

929
00:44:08.120 --> 00:44:10.340
<v Speaker 3>that it is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>its way of thinking,</v>

930
00:44:10.341 --> 00:44:10.790
<v Speaker 3>so to speak.</v>

931
00:44:10.790 --> 00:44:11.270
<v Speaker 3>if you say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

932
00:44:11.271 --> 00:44:13.850
<v Speaker 3>what's it thinking about?</v>
<v Speaker 3>How do we describe what it's thinking?</v>

933
00:44:14.090 --> 00:44:17.420
<v Speaker 3>That's a tough thing to answer because </v>
<v Speaker 3>just like with the,</v>

934
00:44:17.630 --> 00:44:19.670
<v Speaker 3>with the automated theorem,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're,</v>

935
00:44:19.880 --> 00:44:23.090
<v Speaker 3>we're sort of stuck having to say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

936
00:44:23.870 --> 00:44:28.870
<v Speaker 3>we can't really tell a human story </v>
<v Speaker 3>because the things that had invented a </v>

937
00:44:28.870 --> 00:44:30.230
<v Speaker 3>things for which we don't even have </v>
<v Speaker 3>wordS in our languages and so on.</v>

938
00:44:31.140 --> 00:44:36.140
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So one thing to reAlize is in this kind </v>

939
00:44:36.140 --> 00:44:38.430
<v Speaker 3>of space of sort of all possible </v>
<v Speaker 3>computations,</v>

940
00:44:38.670 --> 00:44:40.620
<v Speaker 3>that a lot of stuff out there that can </v>
<v Speaker 3>be done,</v>

941
00:44:40.830 --> 00:44:45.830
<v Speaker 3>there's this coat kind of ocean of </v>
<v Speaker 3>sophisticated computation and then the </v>

942
00:44:46.400 --> 00:44:50.190
<v Speaker 3>question that we have to ask for us </v>
<v Speaker 3>humans is,</v>

943
00:44:50.250 --> 00:44:52.620
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how do we make use of all of that stuff?</v>

944
00:44:53.160 --> 00:44:57.300
<v Speaker 3>So what we've got kind of on the one </v>
<v Speaker 3>hand is we've got the things we know how</v>

945
00:44:57.301 --> 00:45:01.440
<v Speaker 3>to think about human languages,</v>
<v Speaker 3>our way of describing things,</v>

946
00:45:01.441 --> 00:45:02.880
<v Speaker 3>our way of talking about stuff.</v>

947
00:45:02.880 --> 00:45:04.560
<v Speaker 3>That's the One,</v>
<v Speaker 3>one side of things.</v>

948
00:45:04.770 --> 00:45:09.770
<v Speaker 3>The other side of things we have is this</v>
<v Speaker 3>very powerful kind of ocean of </v>

949
00:45:09.770 --> 00:45:11.550
<v Speaker 3>computation on the other side where lots</v>
<v Speaker 3>of things can happen.</v>

950
00:45:11.970 --> 00:45:15.900
<v Speaker 3>So the question is how do we make use of</v>
<v Speaker 3>this sort of ocean of computation in the</v>

951
00:45:15.901 --> 00:45:19.890
<v Speaker 3>best possible way for our human purposes</v>
<v Speaker 3>and building technology and so on.</v>

952
00:45:20.370 --> 00:45:23.280
<v Speaker 3>And So the way I see,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

953
00:45:23.310 --> 00:45:28.310
<v Speaker 3>my kind of a part of what I've spent a </v>
<v Speaker 3>very long time doing this kind of </v>

954
00:45:28.591 --> 00:45:32.130
<v Speaker 3>building a language that allows us to </v>
<v Speaker 3>take human thinking.</v>

955
00:45:32.131 --> 00:45:37.131
<v Speaker 3>On the one hand and describe and sort of</v>
<v Speaker 3>provide a sort of computational </v>

956
00:45:38.191 --> 00:45:43.191
<v Speaker 3>communication language that allows us to</v>
<v Speaker 3>get the benefit of what's possible over </v>

957
00:45:43.191 --> 00:45:47.781
<v Speaker 3>in the sort of ocean of computation in a</v>
<v Speaker 3>way that's rooted in what we humans </v>

958
00:45:48.121 --> 00:45:53.121
<v Speaker 3>actually want to do.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so I kind of view or from language </v>

959
00:45:53.121 --> 00:45:55.290
<v Speaker 3>as being sort of an attempt to make a </v>
<v Speaker 3>bridge between.</v>

960
00:45:55.290 --> 00:45:56.010
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

961
00:45:56.100 --> 00:45:58.410
<v Speaker 3>on the one hand there's all possible </v>
<v Speaker 3>computations.</v>

962
00:45:58.770 --> 00:46:03.770
<v Speaker 3>On the other hand,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's things we think we want to do </v>

963
00:46:03.770 --> 00:46:06.800
<v Speaker 3>and I view often language languages </v>
<v Speaker 3>being my best attempt right now to make </v>

964
00:46:07.561 --> 00:46:12.561
<v Speaker 3>a way to take our sort of human </v>
<v Speaker 3>computational thinking and be able to </v>

965
00:46:13.651 --> 00:46:15.630
<v Speaker 3>actually implement it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So in a sense,</v>

966
00:46:15.631 --> 00:46:18.780
<v Speaker 3>iT's a language which works in two on </v>
<v Speaker 3>two sides.</v>

967
00:46:18.781 --> 00:46:23.781
<v Speaker 3>It's both a language where you as a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

968
00:46:24.430 --> 00:46:26.700
<v Speaker 3>as uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the machine can understand,</v>

969
00:46:26.701 --> 00:46:31.701
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's looking at this and that's what </v>

970
00:46:31.701 --> 00:46:31.701
<v Speaker 3>it's going to compute.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But on the other hand,</v>

971
00:46:31.701 --> 00:46:35.781
<v Speaker 3>it's also a language for us humans to </v>
<v Speaker 3>think about things and computational </v>

972
00:46:35.781 --> 00:46:35.781
<v Speaker 3>terms.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

973
00:46:35.781 --> 00:46:37.190
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if I go and I,</v>

974
00:46:37.220 --> 00:46:38.490
<v Speaker 3>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>one of these,</v>

975
00:46:38.550 --> 00:46:43.550
<v Speaker 3>one of these things that I'm doing here,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whatever it is that this wasn't that </v>

976
00:46:43.550 --> 00:46:43.550
<v Speaker 3>exciting but,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but,</v>

977
00:46:43.550 --> 00:46:43.860
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

978
00:46:43.861 --> 00:46:48.780
<v Speaker 3>find shortest tour of the geo position </v>
<v Speaker 3>of a capital cities in south America.</v>

979
00:46:49.170 --> 00:46:54.170
<v Speaker 3>That is a language that's a </v>
<v Speaker 3>representation or a precise language of </v>

980
00:46:54.170 --> 00:46:58.311
<v Speaker 3>something.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And the idea is that that's a language </v>

981
00:46:58.311 --> 00:47:01.460
<v Speaker 3>which we humans can find useful in </v>
<v Speaker 3>thinking about things in computational </v>

982
00:47:01.460 --> 00:47:06.231
<v Speaker 3>terms.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It also happens to be a language that </v>

983
00:47:06.231 --> 00:47:06.231
<v Speaker 3>the machine can immediately understand </v>
<v Speaker 3>and execute.</v>

984
00:47:06.570 --> 00:47:08.550
<v Speaker 3>And so I think this is sort of a </v>
<v Speaker 3>general,</v>

985
00:47:08.690 --> 00:47:10.800
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when I think about ai in general,</v>

986
00:47:11.070 --> 00:47:11.910
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

987
00:47:11.911 --> 00:47:14.670
<v Speaker 3>what is the sort of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what's the overall problem?</v>

988
00:47:14.671 --> 00:47:16.830
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>part of the overall problem is so how do</v>

989
00:47:16.831 --> 00:47:19.080
<v Speaker 3>we tell the ais what to do,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so to speak.</v>

990
00:47:19.410 --> 00:47:21.390
<v Speaker 3>There's this very powerful,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

991
00:47:21.420 --> 00:47:26.420
<v Speaker 3>this sort of ocean of computation is </v>
<v Speaker 3>what we get to mine for purposes of </v>

992
00:47:26.420 --> 00:47:30.351
<v Speaker 3>building ai kinds of things.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But then the question is how do we tell </v>

993
00:47:30.351 --> 00:47:34.170
<v Speaker 3>ais what to do and what I see,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what I've tried to do with wolfram </v>

994
00:47:34.691 --> 00:47:39.691
<v Speaker 3>language is to provide a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a way of kind of accessing that </v>

995
00:47:39.821 --> 00:47:44.821
<v Speaker 3>computation and sort of making use of </v>
<v Speaker 3>the knowledge that our civilization has </v>

996
00:47:45.401 --> 00:47:49.030
<v Speaker 3>accumulated and because that's the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

997
00:47:49.300 --> 00:47:54.300
<v Speaker 3>there's the general computation on,</v>
<v Speaker 3>on this side and there's the specific </v>

998
00:47:54.300 --> 00:47:58.321
<v Speaker 3>things that we humans have thought about</v>
<v Speaker 3>and the question is to make use of the </v>

999
00:47:58.321 --> 00:48:01.960
<v Speaker 3>things that we've thought about to do,</v>
<v Speaker 3>do things that we care about doing.</v>

1000
00:48:01.960 --> 00:48:06.960
<v Speaker 3>Actually,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you're interested in these kinds of </v>

1001
00:48:06.960 --> 00:48:08.851
<v Speaker 3>things.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I happen to just write a blog post last </v>

1002
00:48:08.851 --> 00:48:10.550
<v Speaker 3>couple of days ago.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's kind of a funny blog posts.</v>

1003
00:48:10.551 --> 00:48:11.470
<v Speaker 3>It's about,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

1004
00:48:11.820 --> 00:48:15.240
<v Speaker 3>well you can see the title there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It came because a friend of mine has,</v>

1005
00:48:15.430 --> 00:48:20.430
<v Speaker 3>has this crazy project to put little,</v>
<v Speaker 3>little sort of a desks or something </v>

1006
00:48:22.060 --> 00:48:22.690
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

1007
00:48:22.720 --> 00:48:26.650
<v Speaker 3>should represent kind of the best </v>
<v Speaker 3>achievements of human civilization,</v>

1008
00:48:26.651 --> 00:48:28.090
<v Speaker 3>so to speak,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to send out.</v>

1009
00:48:28.160 --> 00:48:33.160
<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's hitchhiking on various spacecraft </v>

1010
00:48:33.160 --> 00:48:35.020
<v Speaker 3>that are going out into the solar system</v>
<v Speaker 3>in the next little while.</v>

1011
00:48:35.021 --> 00:48:38.260
<v Speaker 3>And the question is what to put on this </v>
<v Speaker 3>little desk that kind of represents,</v>

1012
00:48:38.500 --> 00:48:40.930
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the achievements of civilization.</v>

1013
00:48:40.940 --> 00:48:43.390
<v Speaker 3>It's kind of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's kind of depressing when you go back</v>

1014
00:48:43.391 --> 00:48:44.620
<v Speaker 3>and you look at what,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

1015
00:48:44.800 --> 00:48:46.900
<v Speaker 3>what people have tried to do on this </v>
<v Speaker 3>before.</v>

1016
00:48:47.230 --> 00:48:51.430
<v Speaker 3>And I'm realizing how hard it is to tell</v>
<v Speaker 3>even whether something is an artifact or</v>

1017
00:48:51.431 --> 00:48:51.820
<v Speaker 3>not.</v>

1018
00:48:52.000 --> 00:48:53.710
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but this is a,</v>

1019
00:48:53.920 --> 00:48:55.080
<v Speaker 3>this was sort of a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

1020
00:48:55.340 --> 00:48:56.020
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's a good one.</v>

1021
00:48:56.021 --> 00:48:57.280
<v Speaker 3>That's from 11,000</v>
<v Speaker 3>years ago.</v>

1022
00:48:57.281 --> 00:48:58.210
<v Speaker 3>Can you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The question is,</v>

1023
00:48:58.211 --> 00:49:01.930
<v Speaker 3>can you figure out what on earth it is </v>
<v Speaker 3>and what it means?</v>

1024
00:49:01.940 --> 00:49:03.370
<v Speaker 3>And this is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1025
00:49:04.440 --> 00:49:04.840
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but,</v>

1026
00:49:04.841 --> 00:49:05.770
<v Speaker 3>but,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so what,</v>

1027
00:49:05.830 --> 00:49:08.960
<v Speaker 3>what's relevant about this is the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this,</v>

1028
00:49:08.970 --> 00:49:12.730
<v Speaker 3>this whole question of there are things </v>
<v Speaker 3>that are out there and the computational</v>

1029
00:49:12.731 --> 00:49:14.830
<v Speaker 3>universe.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And you know,</v>

1030
00:49:14.831 --> 00:49:17.290
<v Speaker 3>when we think about extraterrestrial </v>
<v Speaker 3>intelligence,</v>

1031
00:49:17.470 --> 00:49:22.470
<v Speaker 3>I find it kind of interesting that </v>
<v Speaker 3>artificial intelligence is our first </v>

1032
00:49:22.470 --> 00:49:27.301
<v Speaker 3>example of an alien intelligence.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We don't happen to have found what we </v>

1033
00:49:27.301 --> 00:49:28.690
<v Speaker 3>view as extraterrestrial intelligence </v>
<v Speaker 3>right now,</v>

1034
00:49:28.691 --> 00:49:33.691
<v Speaker 3>but we are in the process of building </v>
<v Speaker 3>pretty decent version of an alien </v>

1035
00:49:33.691 --> 00:49:34.630
<v Speaker 3>intelligence here.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And the question is,</v>

1036
00:49:34.840 --> 00:49:37.420
<v Speaker 3>if you ask questions like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

1037
00:49:37.480 --> 00:49:38.860
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what is it thinking?</v>

1038
00:49:38.890 --> 00:49:43.890
<v Speaker 3>Is it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>does it have a purpose and what it's </v>

1039
00:49:43.890 --> 00:49:45.601
<v Speaker 3>doing and so on,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and you're confronted with things like </v>

1040
00:49:45.601 --> 00:49:45.601
<v Speaker 3>this.</v>

1041
00:49:45.601 --> 00:49:46.840
<v Speaker 3>It's very,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we can kind of do a test run of,</v>

1042
00:49:47.200 --> 00:49:48.070
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what's,</v>

1043
00:49:48.100 --> 00:49:52.090
<v Speaker 3>what's its purpose?</v>
<v Speaker 3>What is it trying to do in a way that is</v>

1044
00:49:52.091 --> 00:49:54.460
<v Speaker 3>very similar to the kinds of questions </v>
<v Speaker 3>you would ask about,</v>

1045
00:49:54.490 --> 00:49:57.190
<v Speaker 3>about extraterrestrial intelligence.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But in any case,</v>

1046
00:49:57.191 --> 00:49:57.730
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

1047
00:49:57.731 --> 00:49:58.780
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1048
00:49:59.010 --> 00:50:04.010
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the main point is that I see there's </v>

1049
00:50:04.010 --> 00:50:05.890
<v Speaker 3>sort of ocean of computation,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's the,</v>

1050
00:50:05.980 --> 00:50:09.280
<v Speaker 3>let's describe what we actually want to </v>
<v Speaker 3>do with that ocean of computation.</v>

1051
00:50:09.610 --> 00:50:10.720
<v Speaker 3>And that's where,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1052
00:50:10.721 --> 00:50:12.160
<v Speaker 3>that's one of the primary problems we </v>
<v Speaker 3>have now.</v>

1053
00:50:12.161 --> 00:50:13.170
<v Speaker 3>People talk about,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1054
00:50:13.240 --> 00:50:16.390
<v Speaker 3>ai and what is ai going to allow us to </v>
<v Speaker 3>automate.</v>

1055
00:50:16.840 --> 00:50:21.840
<v Speaker 3>And my basic answer to that would be </v>
<v Speaker 3>we'll be able to automate everything </v>

1056
00:50:21.840 --> 00:50:26.041
<v Speaker 3>that we can describe.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The problem is it's not clear what we </v>

1057
00:50:26.041 --> 00:50:27.140
<v Speaker 3>can describe or put another way,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1058
00:50:27.141 --> 00:50:30.530
<v Speaker 3>you imagine various jobs and people are </v>
<v Speaker 3>doing things that are repeated judgment,</v>

1059
00:50:30.531 --> 00:50:35.531
<v Speaker 3>jobs,</v>
<v Speaker 3>things like this there where we can </v>

1060
00:50:35.531 --> 00:50:35.531
<v Speaker 3>readily automate those things.</v>

1061
00:50:35.531 --> 00:50:37.520
<v Speaker 3>But the thing that we can't really </v>
<v Speaker 3>automate is saying,</v>

1062
00:50:37.521 --> 00:50:39.620
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what are we trying to do that is,</v>

1063
00:50:39.621 --> 00:50:41.960
<v Speaker 3>what are our goals?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because in a sense,</v>

1064
00:50:42.140 --> 00:50:43.880
<v Speaker 3>when,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when we see one of these systems,</v>

1065
00:50:43.881 --> 00:50:44.660
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let's say,</v>

1066
00:50:44.870 --> 00:50:47.280
<v Speaker 3>let's say it's a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's a cellular automaton here.</v>

1067
00:50:47.390 --> 00:50:48.620
<v Speaker 3>Okay?</v>
<v Speaker 3>The question is,</v>

1068
00:50:48.621 --> 00:50:50.840
<v Speaker 3>what is the cellular automaton trying to</v>
<v Speaker 3>do?</v>

1069
00:50:51.470 --> 00:50:56.470
<v Speaker 3>Maybe I can.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Maybe I'll give you another cellular </v>

1070
00:50:56.470 --> 00:50:56.470
<v Speaker 3>automaton that there's a little bit more</v>
<v Speaker 3>exciting here.</v>

1071
00:50:56.470 --> 00:50:57.560
<v Speaker 3>Let's do this one.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So the,</v>

1072
00:50:57.561 --> 00:51:02.561
<v Speaker 3>the um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the question is what is the cellular </v>

1073
00:51:02.561 --> 00:51:02.610
<v Speaker 3>automaton trying to do?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1074
00:51:02.670 --> 00:51:05.840
<v Speaker 3>it's got this whole big structure here </v>
<v Speaker 3>and things are happening with it.</v>

1075
00:51:05.841 --> 00:51:10.841
<v Speaker 3>We can go,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we can run it for a couple of thousand </v>

1076
00:51:10.841 --> 00:51:10.841
<v Speaker 3>steps.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We can ask.</v>

1077
00:51:10.841 --> 00:51:12.080
<v Speaker 3>So nice example of kind of </v>
<v Speaker 3>undecidability and action.</v>

1078
00:51:12.320 --> 00:51:13.870
<v Speaker 3>What's going to happen here?</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is kind of the whole thing.</v>

1079
00:51:13.910 --> 00:51:16.490
<v Speaker 3>Problem is this kind of holt,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what's it going to do?</v>

1080
00:51:16.750 --> 00:51:19.040
<v Speaker 3>A,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's computational or disability that</v>

1081
00:51:19.041 --> 00:51:21.620
<v Speaker 3>we actually can't tell.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's the case where we know this is a</v>

1082
00:51:21.621 --> 00:51:24.410
<v Speaker 3>universal computer.</v>
<v Speaker 3>In fact eventually,</v>

1083
00:51:24.440 --> 00:51:29.440
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I wouldn't even spell it for you if I </v>

1084
00:51:29.440 --> 00:51:29.440
<v Speaker 3>went on long enough.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It would,</v>

1085
00:51:29.440 --> 00:51:31.280
<v Speaker 3>it would go into some kind of cycle.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But,</v>

1086
00:51:31.281 --> 00:51:36.281
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we can ask what is this thing trying to </v>

1087
00:51:36.281 --> 00:51:36.281
<v Speaker 3>do?</v>
<v Speaker 3>What is it,</v>

1088
00:51:36.281 --> 00:51:36.281
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is it,</v>

1089
00:51:36.290 --> 00:51:37.870
<v Speaker 3>what's it thinking about?</v>
<v Speaker 3>What's it,</v>

1090
00:51:38.660 --> 00:51:40.460
<v Speaker 3>what's its goal,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what's its purpose?</v>

1091
00:51:41.000 --> 00:51:46.000
<v Speaker 3>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we get very quickly and in a big mess </v>

1092
00:51:46.000 --> 00:51:46.000
<v Speaker 3>thinking about those kinds of things.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've,</v>

1093
00:51:46.000 --> 00:51:46.000
<v Speaker 3>I've,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

1094
00:51:46.220 --> 00:51:51.220
<v Speaker 3>one of the things that comes out of this</v>
<v Speaker 3>principle of computational equivalence </v>

1095
00:51:51.220 --> 00:51:54.580
<v Speaker 3>is thinking about what kinds of things </v>
<v Speaker 3>have a,</v>

1096
00:51:55.170 --> 00:51:57.740
<v Speaker 3>are capable of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>of sophisticated computation.</v>

1097
00:51:57.741 --> 00:52:00.890
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so I mentioned a while back here,</v>

1098
00:52:01.570 --> 00:52:06.570
<v Speaker 3>sort of my personal history with wealth </v>
<v Speaker 3>malware of having thought about doing </v>

1099
00:52:06.570 --> 00:52:09.851
<v Speaker 3>something like wealth now for when I was</v>
<v Speaker 3>a kid and then believing that you sort </v>

1100
00:52:09.851 --> 00:52:10.460
<v Speaker 3>of had to build a brain to make that </v>
<v Speaker 3>possible and so on.</v>

1101
00:52:10.880 --> 00:52:15.880
<v Speaker 3>And one of the things that I then </v>
<v Speaker 3>thought was that there was some kind of </v>

1102
00:52:15.880 --> 00:52:19.931
<v Speaker 3>bright line between what is intelligent </v>
<v Speaker 3>and what is merely computational,</v>

1103
00:52:20.781 --> 00:52:25.781
<v Speaker 3>so to speak.</v>
<v Speaker 3>In other words that there was something </v>

1104
00:52:25.781 --> 00:52:25.781
<v Speaker 3>which is like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

1105
00:52:25.781 --> 00:52:28.340
<v Speaker 3>we've got this great thing that we </v>
<v Speaker 3>humans have that is intelligence and all</v>

1106
00:52:28.341 --> 00:52:31.630
<v Speaker 3>these things in nature and so on.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And all the stuff that's going on there.</v>

1107
00:52:31.760 --> 00:52:34.280
<v Speaker 3>It's just computation or it's just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1108
00:52:34.281 --> 00:52:36.320
<v Speaker 3>things operating according to rules </v>
<v Speaker 3>that's different.</v>

1109
00:52:36.321 --> 00:52:38.690
<v Speaker 3>There's some bright line distinction </v>
<v Speaker 3>between these things.</v>

1110
00:52:39.020 --> 00:52:44.020
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think the thing that came about after </v>

1111
00:52:44.020 --> 00:52:47.081
<v Speaker 3>I looked at all these cellular automata </v>
<v Speaker 3>and all kinds of other things like that </v>

1112
00:52:47.081 --> 00:52:50.240
<v Speaker 3>is I sort of came up with this principle</v>
<v Speaker 3>of computational equivalence,</v>

1113
00:52:50.560 --> 00:52:53.570
<v Speaker 3>a idea which we've now got quite a lot </v>
<v Speaker 3>of evidence for,</v>

1114
00:52:53.571 --> 00:52:55.670
<v Speaker 3>which I talked about people are </v>
<v Speaker 3>interested in.</v>

1115
00:52:56.090 --> 00:53:01.090
<v Speaker 3>But that basically there isn't a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that once you reach a certain level of </v>

1116
00:53:02.630 --> 00:53:05.090
<v Speaker 3>computational sophistication,</v>
<v Speaker 3>everything is equivalent.</v>

1117
00:53:05.540 --> 00:53:10.540
<v Speaker 3>And that means that that implies that </v>
<v Speaker 3>there really isn't a bright line </v>

1118
00:53:10.540 --> 00:53:11.180
<v Speaker 3>distinction between,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for example,</v>

1119
00:53:11.181 --> 00:53:16.181
<v Speaker 3>the computation is going on in our </v>
<v Speaker 3>brains and the computations going on in </v>

1120
00:53:16.181 --> 00:53:18.320
<v Speaker 3>this simple cellular automata and so on.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that essentially philosophical point</v>

1121
00:53:18.590 --> 00:53:23.590
<v Speaker 3>is what actually got me to start trying </v>
<v Speaker 3>to build both from alpha because I </v>

1122
00:53:23.590 --> 00:53:23.590
<v Speaker 3>realized that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>gosh,</v>

1123
00:53:23.590 --> 00:53:28.241
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've been looking for this sort of the </v>

1124
00:53:28.241 --> 00:53:30.370
<v Speaker 3>magic bullets of intelligence and I just</v>
<v Speaker 3>decided probably there isn't one and </v>

1125
00:53:30.370 --> 00:53:34.311
<v Speaker 3>actually it's all just computation.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so that means we can actually in </v>

1126
00:53:34.311 --> 00:53:36.660
<v Speaker 3>practice build something that doeS this </v>
<v Speaker 3>kind of intelligent like thing.</v>

1127
00:53:37.080 --> 00:53:42.080
<v Speaker 3>And so that's what I think is the case,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is that there really isn't sort of a </v>

1128
00:53:42.080 --> 00:53:44.340
<v Speaker 3>bright line distinction and that has,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that has more extreme consequences.</v>

1129
00:53:44.341 --> 00:53:45.960
<v Speaker 3>Like people will say things like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1130
00:53:46.140 --> 00:53:47.760
<v Speaker 3>the weAther has a mind of its own.</v>

1131
00:53:48.180 --> 00:53:49.770
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Sounds kind of silly.</v>

1132
00:53:49.771 --> 00:53:52.290
<v Speaker 3>Sounds kind of animistic primitive and </v>
<v Speaker 3>so on.</v>

1133
00:53:52.291 --> 00:53:57.291
<v Speaker 3>But in fact,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the fluid dynamics of the weather is as </v>

1134
00:53:57.291 --> 00:54:01.140
<v Speaker 3>computationally sophisticated as the </v>
<v Speaker 3>stuff that goes on in our brains.</v>

1135
00:54:01.650 --> 00:54:03.870
<v Speaker 3>But we can start askIng,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but then you say,</v>

1136
00:54:03.871 --> 00:54:06.110
<v Speaker 3>but the weather doesn't have a purpose.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1137
00:54:06.150 --> 00:54:07.800
<v Speaker 3>what's the purpose of the weather?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1138
00:54:07.830 --> 00:54:12.830
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>maybe the weather is trying to equalize </v>

1139
00:54:12.830 --> 00:54:12.830
<v Speaker 3>the temperature between the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1140
00:54:12.830 --> 00:54:16.940
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the north pole and the tropics or </v>

1141
00:54:16.940 --> 00:54:16.940
<v Speaker 3>something.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then we have to say,</v>

1142
00:54:16.940 --> 00:54:17.910
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but that's not a purpose.</v>

1143
00:54:17.911 --> 00:54:19.560
<v Speaker 3>And the way that we think about </v>
<v Speaker 3>purposes,</v>

1144
00:54:19.561 --> 00:54:21.000
<v Speaker 3>that's just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1145
00:54:21.150 --> 00:54:26.150
<v Speaker 3>and we get very confused.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And in the end what we realized is when </v>

1146
00:54:26.150 --> 00:54:26.150
<v Speaker 3>we're talking about things like </v>
<v Speaker 3>purposes,</v>

1147
00:54:26.520 --> 00:54:31.520
<v Speaker 3>we have to have this kind of chain of </v>
<v Speaker 3>provenance that goes back to humans and </v>

1148
00:54:31.651 --> 00:54:33.300
<v Speaker 3>human history and all that kind of </v>
<v Speaker 3>thing.</v>

1149
00:54:33.720 --> 00:54:38.720
<v Speaker 3>And I think it's the same type of thing </v>
<v Speaker 3>when we talk about computation and ai </v>

1150
00:54:38.720 --> 00:54:39.750
<v Speaker 3>and so on.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The thing that we.</v>

1151
00:54:39.840 --> 00:54:43.260
<v Speaker 3>This question of sort of purpose goals,</v>
<v Speaker 3>things like this,</v>

1152
00:54:43.590 --> 00:54:47.910
<v Speaker 3>that's the thing which is intrinsically </v>
<v Speaker 3>human and not something that we can ever</v>

1153
00:54:47.911 --> 00:54:52.911
<v Speaker 3>sort of automatically generate.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It makes no sense to talk about </v>

1154
00:54:52.911 --> 00:54:53.460
<v Speaker 3>automatically generating it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because these computational systems,</v>

1155
00:54:53.461 --> 00:54:55.220
<v Speaker 3>they do all kinds of stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1156
00:54:55.230 --> 00:54:57.990
<v Speaker 3>we can say they've got a purpose.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We can attribute purposes to them,</v>

1157
00:54:57.991 --> 00:54:58.660
<v Speaker 3>et cetera,</v>
<v Speaker 3>et cetera,</v>

1158
00:54:58.661 --> 00:54:59.890
<v Speaker 3>et cetera.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But you know,</v>

1159
00:54:59.910 --> 00:55:04.910
<v Speaker 3>ultimately it's sort of the human thread</v>
<v Speaker 3>of purpose that we have to have to deal </v>

1160
00:55:04.910 --> 00:55:04.950
<v Speaker 3>with.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So that means,</v>

1161
00:55:04.951 --> 00:55:09.951
<v Speaker 3>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when we talk about ais and we were </v>

1162
00:55:09.951 --> 00:55:09.951
<v Speaker 3>interested in things like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so how do we tell,</v>

1163
00:55:09.951 --> 00:55:10.190
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

1164
00:55:10.230 --> 00:55:14.190
<v Speaker 3>like we'd like to be able to tell.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We talk about ai ethics for example.</v>

1165
00:55:14.430 --> 00:55:17.580
<v Speaker 3>We'd like to be able to make a statement</v>
<v Speaker 3>to the ais like,</v>

1166
00:55:17.840 --> 00:55:19.210
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>please be nIce to,</v>

1167
00:55:19.250 --> 00:55:22.940
<v Speaker 3>to us humans and that's a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1168
00:55:23.010 --> 00:55:26.370
<v Speaker 3>that's something.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So one of the issues there is so,</v>

1169
00:55:26.371 --> 00:55:31.371
<v Speaker 3>so talking about that kind of thing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm one of the issues is how are we </v>

1170
00:55:31.441 --> 00:55:34.560
<v Speaker 3>going to make a statement like be nice </v>
<v Speaker 3>to us humans.</v>

1171
00:55:34.830 --> 00:55:39.830
<v Speaker 3>What's the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how are we going to explain that to an </v>

1172
00:55:39.830 --> 00:55:40.560
<v Speaker 3>ai?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And this is where again,</v>

1173
00:55:40.850 --> 00:55:44.430
<v Speaker 3>you know my,</v>
<v Speaker 3>my efforts to build a language,</v>

1174
00:55:44.431 --> 00:55:49.431
<v Speaker 3>a computational communication language </v>
<v Speaker 3>that bridges the world of what we humans</v>

1175
00:55:49.441 --> 00:55:53.520
<v Speaker 3>think about and the world of what is </v>
<v Speaker 3>possible and computation is important.</v>

1176
00:55:53.850 --> 00:55:58.850
<v Speaker 3>And So one of the things I've been </v>
<v Speaker 3>interested in is actually building what </v>

1177
00:55:58.850 --> 00:56:01.791
<v Speaker 3>I call a symbolic discourse language </v>
<v Speaker 3>that can be a general representation for</v>

1178
00:56:02.100 --> 00:56:05.040
<v Speaker 3>a sort of the kinds of things that we </v>
<v Speaker 3>might want to,</v>

1179
00:56:05.360 --> 00:56:07.410
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>put in,</v>

1180
00:56:07.740 --> 00:56:12.740
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that we might want to say and things </v>

1181
00:56:12.740 --> 00:56:12.740
<v Speaker 3>like be nice to humans.</v>

1182
00:56:12.740 --> 00:56:13.560
<v Speaker 3>So sort of a little bit of background to</v>
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>

1183
00:56:13.710 --> 00:56:14.410
<v Speaker 3>So you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in,</v>

1184
00:56:14.411 --> 00:56:17.430
<v Speaker 3>in the modern world,</v>
<v Speaker 3>people are keen on smart contracts.</v>

1185
00:56:17.730 --> 00:56:20.210
<v Speaker 3>They often think of them has been deeply</v>
<v Speaker 3>tied into blockchain,</v>

1186
00:56:20.220 --> 00:56:21.630
<v Speaker 3>which I don't think it's really quite </v>
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>

1187
00:56:22.100 --> 00:56:27.100
<v Speaker 3>The important thing about smart </v>
<v Speaker 3>contracts is it's a way of having sort </v>

1188
00:56:27.100 --> 00:56:30.910
<v Speaker 3>of an agreement between parties which </v>
<v Speaker 3>can be executed automatically.</v>

1189
00:56:31.210 --> 00:56:33.040
<v Speaker 3>And that agreement may be,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1190
00:56:33.041 --> 00:56:37.210
<v Speaker 3>you may choose to sort of anchor that </v>
<v Speaker 3>agreement on blockchain.</v>

1191
00:56:37.211 --> 00:56:42.211
<v Speaker 3>You may not,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but the whole point is you have to </v>

1192
00:56:42.211 --> 00:56:42.211
<v Speaker 3>watch,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1193
00:56:42.211 --> 00:56:45.390
<v Speaker 3>when people like legal contracts,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they write them in an approximation to </v>

1194
00:56:45.390 --> 00:56:49.171
<v Speaker 3>english.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They write them in legal ease typically </v>

1195
00:56:49.171 --> 00:56:49.171
<v Speaker 3>because they're trying to write them in </v>
<v Speaker 3>something a little bit more precise than</v>

1196
00:56:49.171 --> 00:56:52.960
<v Speaker 3>regular english.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But the limitiNg case of that is to make</v>

1197
00:56:53.230 --> 00:56:58.230
<v Speaker 3>a symbolic discourse language in which </v>
<v Speaker 3>you can write the contract and code </v>

1198
00:56:58.230 --> 00:56:58.230
<v Speaker 3>basically.</v>

1199
00:56:58.570 --> 00:57:03.570
<v Speaker 3>And the.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've been very interested in using </v>

1200
00:57:03.570 --> 00:57:06.391
<v Speaker 3>wolfram language to do that because in </v>
<v Speaker 3>wolfram language we have a language </v>

1201
00:57:06.391 --> 00:57:09.811
<v Speaker 3>which can describe things about the </v>
<v Speaker 3>world and we can talk about the kinds of</v>

1202
00:57:09.881 --> 00:57:12.610
<v Speaker 3>things that people actually talk about </v>
<v Speaker 3>in contracts and so on.</v>

1203
00:57:13.220 --> 00:57:16.090
<v Speaker 3>We're most of the way there to being </v>
<v Speaker 3>able to do that.</v>

1204
00:57:17.140 --> 00:57:19.780
<v Speaker 3>And then when you start thinking about </v>
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>

1205
00:57:19.781 --> 00:57:21.040
<v Speaker 3>you start thInking about,</v>
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

1206
00:57:21.160 --> 00:57:24.620
<v Speaker 3>so we've got this language to describe </v>
<v Speaker 3>things that we,</v>

1207
00:57:24.710 --> 00:57:28.680
<v Speaker 3>that we care about in the world.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so when it comes to things like tell</v>

1208
00:57:28.720 --> 00:57:33.720
<v Speaker 3>the ais to be nice to humans,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we can imagine using both language to </v>

1209
00:57:33.861 --> 00:57:38.861
<v Speaker 3>sort of build an ai constitution that </v>
<v Speaker 3>says this is how the ai is supposed to </v>

1210
00:57:38.861 --> 00:57:40.930
<v Speaker 3>work.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But when we talk about sort of just the,</v>

1211
00:57:40.931 --> 00:57:42.950
<v Speaker 3>the untethered,</v>
<v Speaker 3>untethered,</v>

1212
00:57:42.951 --> 00:57:46.820
<v Speaker 3>ai doesn't have any particular,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's just going to do what it does.</v>

1213
00:57:47.090 --> 00:57:48.750
<v Speaker 3>And if we want it to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1214
00:57:48.800 --> 00:57:51.470
<v Speaker 3>if we want to somehow align it with </v>
<v Speaker 3>human purposes,</v>

1215
00:57:51.590 --> 00:57:55.460
<v Speaker 3>we have to have some way to sort of talk</v>
<v Speaker 3>to the ai and that's,</v>

1216
00:57:55.600 --> 00:57:56.750
<v Speaker 3>that's uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1217
00:57:56.770 --> 00:58:00.260
<v Speaker 3>I view my efforts to bilbo from language</v>
<v Speaker 3>as,</v>

1218
00:58:00.450 --> 00:58:01.360
<v Speaker 3>as way to do that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1219
00:58:01.361 --> 00:58:01.920
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1220
00:58:02.120 --> 00:58:05.600
<v Speaker 3>as I was showing at the beginning,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can use,</v>

1221
00:58:05.870 --> 00:58:10.870
<v Speaker 3>you can take natural language and wIth </v>
<v Speaker 3>natural language you can build up a </v>

1222
00:58:10.870 --> 00:58:15.101
<v Speaker 3>certain amount of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can say a certain number of things </v>

1223
00:58:15.101 --> 00:58:15.101
<v Speaker 3>and natural language.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can then say,</v>

1224
00:58:15.101 --> 00:58:19.841
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how do we make this more precise in a </v>

1225
00:58:19.841 --> 00:58:20.690
<v Speaker 3>precise symbolic language if you want to</v>
<v Speaker 3>build up more complicated things,</v>

1226
00:58:20.870 --> 00:58:23.030
<v Speaker 3>it gets hard to do that and natural </v>
<v Speaker 3>language.</v>

1227
00:58:23.210 --> 00:58:26.560
<v Speaker 3>And so you have to kind of build up more</v>
<v Speaker 3>serious programs in,</v>

1228
00:58:26.600 --> 00:58:28.760
<v Speaker 3>in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in symbolic language.</v>

1229
00:58:29.330 --> 00:58:34.330
<v Speaker 3>And I've probably been numb,</v>
<v Speaker 3>been yacking while here and I'm happy </v>

1230
00:58:34.330 --> 00:58:38.731
<v Speaker 3>to.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I can talk about all kinds of different </v>

1231
00:58:38.731 --> 00:58:38.731
<v Speaker 3>things here.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But,</v>

1232
00:58:38.731 --> 00:58:38.800
<v Speaker 3>but maybe I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1233
00:58:38.820 --> 00:58:41.780
<v Speaker 3>I've not seen as many reactions as I </v>
<v Speaker 3>might've expected to think.</v>

1234
00:58:41.781 --> 00:58:44.230
<v Speaker 3>So I'm not sure which things people are </v>
<v Speaker 3>interested in,</v>

1235
00:58:44.231 --> 00:58:44.950
<v Speaker 3>which they're not.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But,</v>

1236
00:58:44.951 --> 00:58:48.880
<v Speaker 3>so maybe I should,</v>
<v Speaker 3>maybe I should stop here and we can have</v>

1237
00:58:48.910 --> 00:58:50.710
<v Speaker 3>discussion questions,</v>
<v Speaker 3>comments?</v>

1238
00:58:50.740 --> 00:58:51.130
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>

1239
00:58:54.530 --> 00:58:56.770
<v Speaker 2>Two microphones.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you have questions,</v>

1240
00:58:56.771 --> 00:58:57.550
<v Speaker 2>please come up.</v>

1241
00:58:58.300 --> 00:58:58.730
<v Speaker 4>So,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

1242
00:58:58.760 --> 00:59:03.760
<v Speaker 4>I have a quick question.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's close to the earlier part of your </v>

1243
00:59:03.760 --> 00:59:04.270
<v Speaker 4>talk where you say you don't build a top</v>
<v Speaker 4>down ontology,</v>

1244
00:59:04.271 --> 00:59:07.360
<v Speaker 4>you actually build from the bottom up </v>
<v Speaker 4>with disparate domains.</v>

1245
00:59:08.110 --> 00:59:13.110
<v Speaker 4>What do you feel are the core </v>
<v Speaker 4>technologies of the knowledge </v>

1246
00:59:13.110 --> 00:59:15.781
<v Speaker 4>representation which you used within </v>
<v Speaker 4>wolfram alpha that allows you a </v>

1247
00:59:15.781 --> 00:59:20.340
<v Speaker 4>different domains to reason about each </v>
<v Speaker 4>other to come up with solutions and is </v>

1248
00:59:20.340 --> 00:59:23.600
<v Speaker 4>there any feeling of differentiability </v>
<v Speaker 4>for examples if you were to come up with</v>

1249
00:59:23.601 --> 00:59:27.350
<v Speaker 4>a plan to do something new within </v>
<v Speaker 4>wolfram alpha language,</v>

1250
00:59:28.280 --> 00:59:29.470
<v Speaker 4>how would you go about doing that?</v>

1251
00:59:30.320 --> 00:59:34.070
<v Speaker 5>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so we've done maybe a couple of thousand</v>

1252
00:59:34.071 --> 00:59:35.570
<v Speaker 5>domains.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>

1253
00:59:36.020 --> 00:59:41.020
<v Speaker 5>They,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what is actually involved in doing one </v>

1254
00:59:41.020 --> 00:59:41.020
<v Speaker 5>of these domains.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's,</v>

1255
00:59:41.020 --> 00:59:45.790
<v Speaker 5>it's a gnarly business.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Every domain has some crazy different </v>

1256
00:59:45.790 --> 00:59:47.810
<v Speaker 5>thing about it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I tried to make up actually a while ago,</v>

1257
00:59:48.380 --> 00:59:48.980
<v Speaker 5>we,</v>
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

1258
00:59:49.280 --> 00:59:53.780
<v Speaker 5>let me show you something that kind of a</v>
<v Speaker 5>hierarchy of what it means to make.</v>

1259
00:59:54.240 --> 00:59:59.240
<v Speaker 5>See if I can find this here,</v>
<v Speaker 5>kind of a hierarchy of what it means to </v>

1260
00:59:59.240 --> 01:00:00.580
<v Speaker 5>make a domain computable.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Uh,</v>

1261
01:00:00.610 --> 01:00:03.060
<v Speaker 5>where is it?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Here we go.</v>

1262
01:00:08.930 --> 01:00:09.680
<v Speaker 5>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 5>here we go.</v>

1263
01:00:09.920 --> 01:00:14.920
<v Speaker 5>So this is sort of a hierarchy of levels</v>
<v Speaker 5>of what it means to make a domain </v>

1264
01:00:14.920 --> 01:00:16.160
<v Speaker 5>computable from just,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1265
01:00:16.161 --> 01:00:17.570
<v Speaker 5>you've got some,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1266
01:00:17.640 --> 01:00:19.850
<v Speaker 5>you've got some array of data that's </v>
<v Speaker 5>quite structured.</v>

1267
01:00:19.890 --> 01:00:24.890
<v Speaker 5>Forget the separate issue about </v>
<v Speaker 5>extracting things from unstructured </v>

1268
01:00:24.890 --> 01:00:25.760
<v Speaker 5>data,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but let's imagine that you were given,</v>

1269
01:00:26.030 --> 01:00:26.960
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>a,</v>

1270
01:00:27.380 --> 01:00:31.610
<v Speaker 5>a bunch of data about landing sites of </v>
<v Speaker 5>meteorites or something.</v>

1271
01:00:31.850 --> 01:00:33.890
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So you go through various levels,</v>

1272
01:00:33.891 --> 01:00:35.300
<v Speaker 5>so you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>things like,</v>

1273
01:00:36.050 --> 01:00:41.050
<v Speaker 5>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the landing sites of the meteorites are </v>

1274
01:00:41.050 --> 01:00:43.001
<v Speaker 5>the other positions,</v>
<v Speaker 5>just strings or there's some kind of </v>

1275
01:00:43.001 --> 01:00:43.340
<v Speaker 5>canonical representation of geo </v>
<v Speaker 5>possession.</v>

1276
01:00:43.850 --> 01:00:46.390
<v Speaker 5>Is the,</v>
<v Speaker 5>is the type of meteorite,</v>

1277
01:00:46.550 --> 01:00:48.230
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>some of them are iron meteorites,</v>

1278
01:00:48.231 --> 01:00:53.231
<v Speaker 5>some of them are stone meteorites.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Have you made a canonical </v>

1279
01:00:53.231 --> 01:00:55.340
<v Speaker 5>representation?</v>
<v Speaker 5>have you made some kind of a way to uh,</v>

1280
01:00:56.060 --> 01:00:58.610
<v Speaker 5>to identify what.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm sorry,</v>

1281
01:00:58.611 --> 01:00:59.180
<v Speaker 5>go ahead.</v>
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>

1282
01:00:59.181 --> 01:01:00.650
<v Speaker 5>no,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean to do that.</v>

1283
01:01:00.651 --> 01:01:00.920
<v Speaker 5>So,</v>

1284
01:01:01.030 --> 01:01:04.120
<v Speaker 4>so my question is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if you did have positions as a string as</v>

1285
01:01:04.121 --> 01:01:07.780
<v Speaker 4>well as a canonical representation,</v>
<v Speaker 4>do you have redundant pieces of the same</v>

1286
01:01:08.440 --> 01:01:12.310
<v Speaker 4>redundant representations of the same </v>
<v Speaker 4>information in different?</v>

1287
01:01:14.680 --> 01:01:16.750
<v Speaker 5>You always,</v>
<v Speaker 5>everything can that you have.</v>

1288
01:01:17.060 --> 01:01:18.760
<v Speaker 5>You have a minimal representation of </v>
<v Speaker 5>everything.</v>

1289
01:01:18.761 --> 01:01:21.040
<v Speaker 5>So our goal is to make everything </v>
<v Speaker 5>canonical.</v>

1290
01:01:21.280 --> 01:01:22.760
<v Speaker 5>Now that's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1291
01:01:22.870 --> 01:01:25.150
<v Speaker 5>there is a lot of complexity in doing </v>
<v Speaker 5>that.</v>

1292
01:01:25.151 --> 01:01:26.430
<v Speaker 5>I mean if you,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1293
01:01:26.440 --> 01:01:27.520
<v Speaker 5>in each.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>

1294
01:01:27.521 --> 01:01:29.860
<v Speaker 5>So another feature of these domains.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>

1295
01:01:29.861 --> 01:01:31.870
<v Speaker 5>So here's another,</v>
<v Speaker 5>another thing to say,</v>

1296
01:01:33.490 --> 01:01:38.490
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it will be lovely if I could just </v>

1297
01:01:38.490 --> 01:01:38.490
<v Speaker 5>automate everything and cut the humans </v>
<v Speaker 5>out of the loop.</v>

1298
01:01:38.490 --> 01:01:41.200
<v Speaker 5>Turns out this doesn't work.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And in fact,</v>

1299
01:01:41.201 --> 01:01:46.201
<v Speaker 5>whenever we do these domains,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's fairly critical to have expert </v>

1300
01:01:46.201 --> 01:01:48.010
<v Speaker 5>humans who really understand the domain </v>
<v Speaker 5>or you simply get it wrong.</v>

1301
01:01:48.460 --> 01:01:52.330
<v Speaker 5>And it's also having said that once </v>
<v Speaker 5>you've done enough domains,</v>

1302
01:01:52.331 --> 01:01:57.331
<v Speaker 5>you can do a lot of crosschecking </v>
<v Speaker 5>between domains and we are the number </v>

1303
01:01:57.331 --> 01:02:01.450
<v Speaker 5>one reporters of error and have errors </v>
<v Speaker 5>and in pretty much all standardized data</v>

1304
01:02:01.451 --> 01:02:04.100
<v Speaker 5>sources because we can do that kind of </v>
<v Speaker 5>cross checkinG.</v>

1305
01:02:04.420 --> 01:02:08.530
<v Speaker 5>But I think if you ask the question,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what's involved in,</v>

1306
01:02:08.531 --> 01:02:12.040
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>in bringing online a new domain,</v>

1307
01:02:12.430 --> 01:02:17.430
<v Speaker 5>it's those sort of hierarchy of things.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Some of those take a few hours.</v>

1308
01:02:17.950 --> 01:02:20.400
<v Speaker 5>You can get to the point of having,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1309
01:02:20.401 --> 01:02:23.040
<v Speaker 5>we've got good enough tools for </v>
<v Speaker 5>ingesting data,</v>

1310
01:02:23.250 --> 01:02:24.090
<v Speaker 5>figuring out,</v>
<v Speaker 5>oh,</v>

1311
01:02:24.091 --> 01:02:25.920
<v Speaker 5>those are names of cities in that </v>
<v Speaker 5>column.</v>

1312
01:02:25.930 --> 01:02:28.140
<v Speaker 5>Let's canonic allies.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Those,</v>

1313
01:02:28.860 --> 01:02:33.860
<v Speaker 5>some may be questions,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but many of them will be able to nail </v>

1314
01:02:33.860 --> 01:02:36.921
<v Speaker 5>down and to get to the full level of,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you've got some complicated domain and </v>

1315
01:02:37.021 --> 01:02:40.350
<v Speaker 5>it's fully computable is probably a year</v>
<v Speaker 5>of work.</v>

1316
01:02:40.980 --> 01:02:41.760
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and,</v>

1317
01:02:41.761 --> 01:02:43.020
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and you might say,</v>

1318
01:02:43.021 --> 01:02:43.890
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>gosh,</v>

1319
01:02:43.910 --> 01:02:45.330
<v Speaker 5>why?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Why are you wasting your time?</v>

1320
01:02:45.331 --> 01:02:50.331
<v Speaker 5>You've got to be able to automate that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So you can probably tell we're fairly </v>

1321
01:02:50.331 --> 01:02:50.670
<v Speaker 5>sophisticated about machine learning </v>
<v Speaker 5>kinds of things and so on.</v>

1322
01:02:50.880 --> 01:02:55.880
<v Speaker 5>And we have tried to automate as much as</v>
<v Speaker 5>we can and we have got a pretty </v>

1323
01:02:55.921 --> 01:02:56.970
<v Speaker 5>efficient pipeline.</v>

1324
01:02:57.150 --> 01:03:00.240
<v Speaker 5>But if you actually want to get it right</v>
<v Speaker 5>and you see it,</v>

1325
01:03:00.241 --> 01:03:05.241
<v Speaker 5>here's an example of what happens,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that there's a level even going between </v>

1326
01:03:05.241 --> 01:03:07.050
<v Speaker 5>wolf malfa more from language.</v>
<v Speaker 5>there's a level of.</v>

1327
01:03:07.140 --> 01:03:09.660
<v Speaker 5>So for example,</v>
<v Speaker 5>let's say you're looking at,</v>

1328
01:03:09.661 --> 01:03:11.640
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>lakes in Wisconsin.</v>

1329
01:03:11.970 --> 01:03:16.970
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So people are querying about lakes in </v>

1330
01:03:16.970 --> 01:03:19.161
<v Speaker 5>Wisconsin and wolfram alpha,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they'll name a particular lake and they </v>

1331
01:03:19.161 --> 01:03:19.161
<v Speaker 5>want to know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1332
01:03:19.161 --> 01:03:20.400
<v Speaker 5>how big is the lake?</v>
<v Speaker 5>okay,</v>

1333
01:03:20.401 --> 01:03:25.401
<v Speaker 5>fine.</v>
<v Speaker 5>In wolfram language they'll be doing a </v>

1334
01:03:25.401 --> 01:03:25.800
<v Speaker 5>systematic computation about lakes in </v>
<v Speaker 5>Wisconsin.</v>

1335
01:03:25.950 --> 01:03:29.070
<v Speaker 5>So if there's a lake missing,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you're going to get the wrong answer.</v>

1336
01:03:29.400 --> 01:03:31.750
<v Speaker 5>And So that's a kind of higher level of,</v>
<v Speaker 5>of uh,</v>

1337
01:03:32.160 --> 01:03:33.540
<v Speaker 5>of,</v>
<v Speaker 5>of difficulty.</v>

1338
01:03:33.680 --> 01:03:35.010
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But the,</v>

1339
01:03:35.050 --> 01:03:40.050
<v Speaker 5>there's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think you're asking some more </v>

1340
01:03:40.050 --> 01:03:40.050
<v Speaker 5>technical questions about ontologies and</v>
<v Speaker 5>I can try and answer those.</v>

1341
01:03:40.260 --> 01:03:41.640
<v Speaker 5>Actually.</v>
<v Speaker 5>One quick question.</v>

1342
01:03:41.700 --> 01:03:45.120
<v Speaker 5>Can you know there's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there's a lot of other questions.</v>

1343
01:03:45.600 --> 01:03:46.440
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 5>All right.</v>

1344
01:03:46.441 --> 01:03:51.300
<v Speaker 5>I'll give it a recycles as I've got a </v>
<v Speaker 5>simple question.</v>

1345
01:03:51.690 --> 01:03:56.040
<v Speaker 5>Who or what are your key influences?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Whoa.</v>

1346
01:03:56.041 --> 01:04:01.041
<v Speaker 5>Gosh.</v>
<v Speaker 5>In terms of of language design for </v>

1347
01:04:01.041 --> 01:04:02.640
<v Speaker 5>orphan language in the context of </v>
<v Speaker 5>machine intelligence,</v>

1348
01:04:02.641 --> 01:04:07.641
<v Speaker 5>if you liked,</v>
<v Speaker 5>if you want to make it tailored to this </v>

1349
01:04:07.641 --> 01:04:07.641
<v Speaker 5>audience.</v>

1350
01:04:08.200 --> 01:04:10.680
<v Speaker 5>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I've been absorbing stuff forever.</v>

1351
01:04:10.690 --> 01:04:14.260
<v Speaker 5>I think my main in terms of language </v>
<v Speaker 5>design,</v>

1352
01:04:14.261 --> 01:04:19.261
<v Speaker 5>probably lisp in apl with my sort of </v>
<v Speaker 5>early influences,</v>

1353
01:04:19.451 --> 01:04:21.290
<v Speaker 5>but in terms of,</v>
<v Speaker 5>of um,</v>

1354
01:04:21.970 --> 01:04:23.530
<v Speaker 5>thinking about ai,</v>

1355
01:04:25.740 --> 01:04:28.090
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>in,</v>

1356
01:04:28.580 --> 01:04:31.100
<v Speaker 6>I mean I'm kind of</v>

1357
01:04:31.710 --> 01:04:33.840
<v Speaker 5>quite knowledgeable.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I like history of science.</v>

1358
01:04:33.900 --> 01:04:38.460
<v Speaker 5>I'm pretty knowledgeable about the early</v>
<v Speaker 5>history of kind of mathematical logic,</v>

1359
01:04:38.461 --> 01:04:40.650
<v Speaker 5>symbolic kinds of things.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I would say.</v>

1360
01:04:40.830 --> 01:04:42.930
<v Speaker 5>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 5>maybe I can answer that in the negative.</v>

1361
01:04:42.931 --> 01:04:43.950
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I have,</v>

1362
01:04:44.010 --> 01:04:46.050
<v Speaker 5>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 5>in building wolfram alpha,</v>

1363
01:04:47.460 --> 01:04:48.690
<v Speaker 5>I thought,</v>
<v Speaker 5>gosh,</v>

1364
01:04:48.691 --> 01:04:53.691
<v Speaker 5>let me do my homework.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Let me learn all about computational </v>

1365
01:04:53.691 --> 01:04:55.881
<v Speaker 5>linguistics.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Let me hire some computational </v>

1366
01:04:55.881 --> 01:04:57.621
<v Speaker 5>linguistics phds.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That will be a good way to get the </v>

1367
01:04:57.621 --> 01:04:58.950
<v Speaker 5>start.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It turns out we used almost nothing from</v>

1368
01:04:58.951 --> 01:05:03.951
<v Speaker 5>the,</v>
<v Speaker 5>from the previous sort of history of </v>

1369
01:05:03.951 --> 01:05:06.321
<v Speaker 5>computational linguistics,</v>
<v Speaker 5>partly because what we were trying to </v>

1370
01:05:06.321 --> 01:05:06.321
<v Speaker 5>do,</v>
<v Speaker 5>namely short question,</v>

1371
01:05:06.321 --> 01:05:10.611
<v Speaker 5>natural language understanding is </v>
<v Speaker 5>different from a lot of the natural </v>

1372
01:05:10.611 --> 01:05:11.280
<v Speaker 5>language processing,</v>
<v Speaker 5>which has been done in the past.</v>

1373
01:05:11.520 --> 01:05:15.990
<v Speaker 5>I also have made to my disappointment,</v>
<v Speaker 5>very little use of,</v>

1374
01:05:16.020 --> 01:05:19.630
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>people like marvin minsky for example.</v>

1375
01:05:19.631 --> 01:05:21.340
<v Speaker 5>I really don't think.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

1376
01:05:21.341 --> 01:05:26.341
<v Speaker 5>I knew marvin for years and in fact some</v>
<v Speaker 5>of his early work on simple turing </v>

1377
01:05:26.341 --> 01:05:30.331
<v Speaker 5>machines and things,</v>
<v Speaker 5>those are probably more influential to </v>

1378
01:05:30.331 --> 01:05:32.230
<v Speaker 5>me than his work on,</v>
<v Speaker 5>on ai and you know,</v>

1379
01:05:32.260 --> 01:05:37.260
<v Speaker 5>probably my,</v>
<v Speaker 5>my mistake of not understanding that </v>

1380
01:05:37.260 --> 01:05:40.411
<v Speaker 5>better,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but really I would say that I've been </v>

1381
01:05:40.411 --> 01:05:42.930
<v Speaker 5>been rather uninfluenced by,</v>
<v Speaker 5>by sort of the traditional ai kinds of </v>

1382
01:05:42.930 --> 01:05:42.930
<v Speaker 5>things.</v>

1383
01:05:42.930 --> 01:05:44.320
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it probably hasn't helped that I've kind</v>

1384
01:05:44.321 --> 01:05:47.770
<v Speaker 5>of lived through a time when one sort of</v>
<v Speaker 5>ai went from,</v>

1385
01:05:48.070 --> 01:05:49.140
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>when I was a kid,</v>

1386
01:05:49.170 --> 01:05:51.340
<v Speaker 5>ai was going to solve everything in the </v>
<v Speaker 5>world and then,</v>

1387
01:05:51.390 --> 01:05:56.390
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it kind of decade for awhile and then </v>

1388
01:05:56.390 --> 01:05:56.390
<v Speaker 5>sort of come back.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So I,</v>

1389
01:05:56.390 --> 01:05:59.990
<v Speaker 5>I,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so I would say I can describe my </v>

1390
01:05:59.990 --> 01:06:00.200
<v Speaker 5>negative,</v>
<v Speaker 5>my non influences better than my give is</v>

1391
01:06:00.310 --> 01:06:05.310
<v Speaker 5>that you made it your own head and it </v>
<v Speaker 5>sounds as though that's pretty much </v>

1392
01:06:05.310 --> 01:06:05.310
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

1393
01:06:05.310 --> 01:06:05.890
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 5>yes,</v>

1394
01:06:06.020 --> 01:06:08.470
<v Speaker 5>I mean in so far as there's things to </v>
<v Speaker 5>me,</v>

1395
01:06:08.540 --> 01:06:12.140
<v Speaker 5>I mean look things like the um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

1396
01:06:12.550 --> 01:06:13.510
<v Speaker 5>you know.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>

1397
01:06:13.511 --> 01:06:16.540
<v Speaker 5>So for example,</v>
<v Speaker 5>studying simple programs as a.</v>

1398
01:06:16.550 --> 01:06:18.790
<v Speaker 5>I'm trying to understand the universal </v>
<v Speaker 5>simple programs.</v>

1399
01:06:19.150 --> 01:06:24.150
<v Speaker 5>Actually,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the personal history of that sort of </v>

1400
01:06:24.150 --> 01:06:24.150
<v Speaker 5>interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

1401
01:06:24.150 --> 01:06:24.150
<v Speaker 5>I,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I,</v>

1402
01:06:24.150 --> 01:06:26.470
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I used to do particle physics when I was</v>

1403
01:06:26.471 --> 01:06:27.460
<v Speaker 5>a kid basically.</v>

1404
01:06:27.880 --> 01:06:29.250
<v Speaker 5>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

1405
01:06:29.710 --> 01:06:31.750
<v Speaker 5>then I actually got interested.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>

1406
01:06:31.751 --> 01:06:36.751
<v Speaker 5>So I'll tell you the history of that </v>
<v Speaker 5>just as an example of how sort of </v>

1407
01:06:36.751 --> 01:06:36.751
<v Speaker 5>interesting as a sort of history of </v>
<v Speaker 5>ideas type thing.</v>

1408
01:06:37.000 --> 01:06:40.630
<v Speaker 5>So I was interested in,</v>
<v Speaker 5>in how order arises in the universe.</v>

1409
01:06:40.840 --> 01:06:45.840
<v Speaker 5>So you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you start off from the hot big bang and </v>

1410
01:06:45.840 --> 01:06:48.511
<v Speaker 5>then pretty soon you end up with a bunch</v>
<v Speaker 5>of humans and galaxies and things like </v>

1411
01:06:48.511 --> 01:06:48.511
<v Speaker 5>this.</v>
<v Speaker 5>How does this happen?</v>

1412
01:06:48.820 --> 01:06:53.820
<v Speaker 5>So I got an interest in that question.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I was also interested in things like </v>

1413
01:06:53.820 --> 01:06:58.030
<v Speaker 5>neural networks for sort of ai purposes </v>
<v Speaker 5>and I thought let me make a minimal </v>

1414
01:06:58.541 --> 01:07:03.160
<v Speaker 5>model that encompasses sort of how </v>
<v Speaker 5>complex things arise from,</v>

1415
01:07:03.490 --> 01:07:08.490
<v Speaker 5>from other stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And I ended up sort of making simpler </v>

1416
01:07:08.490 --> 01:07:12.601
<v Speaker 5>and simpler and simpler models and </v>
<v Speaker 5>eventually wound up with cellular </v>

1417
01:07:12.601 --> 01:07:15.001
<v Speaker 5>automata and whIch I didn't know were </v>
<v Speaker 5>called cellular automata when I started </v>

1418
01:07:15.001 --> 01:07:18.750
<v Speaker 5>looking at them and then found they did </v>
<v Speaker 5>an interesting things and the two areas </v>

1419
01:07:18.750 --> 01:07:22.651
<v Speaker 5>where cellular automata had been </v>
<v Speaker 5>singularly unuseful in analyzing things </v>

1420
01:07:22.811 --> 01:07:26.630
<v Speaker 5>are large scale structure in the </v>
<v Speaker 5>universe and your own networks.</v>

1421
01:07:26.970 --> 01:07:28.670
<v Speaker 5>So it turned out.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But,</v>

1422
01:07:28.730 --> 01:07:30.160
<v Speaker 5>but that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>by the way,</v>

1423
01:07:30.161 --> 01:07:33.100
<v Speaker 5>the fact that I couldn't have even </v>
<v Speaker 5>imagined that one could just start.</v>

1424
01:07:33.101 --> 01:07:34.120
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I should say,</v>

1425
01:07:34.540 --> 01:07:37.330
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I've been doing physics and in physics,</v>

1426
01:07:37.360 --> 01:07:42.360
<v Speaker 5>the kind of intellectual concept is you </v>
<v Speaker 5>take the world as it is and you're </v>

1427
01:07:42.360 --> 01:07:43.590
<v Speaker 5>trying to drill down and find out what,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1428
01:07:43.630 --> 01:07:45.880
<v Speaker 5>what makes the world out of primitives </v>
<v Speaker 5>and so on.</v>

1429
01:07:46.090 --> 01:07:51.090
<v Speaker 5>It's kind of a reduced to find things.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Then I built my first computer language,</v>

1430
01:07:51.221 --> 01:07:54.610
<v Speaker 5>I think of the snp which went the other </v>
<v Speaker 5>way round where I was just like,</v>

1431
01:07:54.611 --> 01:07:57.640
<v Speaker 5>I'm just going to make up this computer </v>
<v Speaker 5>language and you know,</v>

1432
01:07:57.880 --> 01:07:59.710
<v Speaker 5>just make up what I want the primitives </v>
<v Speaker 5>to be.</v>

1433
01:07:59.711 --> 01:08:01.180
<v Speaker 5>And then I'm going to build stuff up </v>
<v Speaker 5>from it.</v>

1434
01:08:01.510 --> 01:08:06.510
<v Speaker 5>I think that the fact that I kind of had</v>
<v Speaker 5>the idea of doing things like making up </v>

1435
01:08:06.510 --> 01:08:10.890
<v Speaker 5>a little automatons as possible models </v>
<v Speaker 5>for the world was a consequence of the </v>

1436
01:08:10.890 --> 01:08:11.080
<v Speaker 5>fact that I've worked on this computer </v>
<v Speaker 5>language,</v>

1437
01:08:11.290 --> 01:08:14.110
<v Speaker 5>which was a thing which worked the </v>
<v Speaker 5>opposite way round from the way that one</v>

1438
01:08:14.111 --> 01:08:19.111
<v Speaker 5>is used to doing natural,</v>
<v Speaker 5>which is sort of this reductionist </v>

1439
01:08:19.111 --> 01:08:19.111
<v Speaker 5>approach.</v>

1440
01:08:19.111 --> 01:08:19.520
<v Speaker 5>And that's.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

1441
01:08:19.690 --> 01:08:24.690
<v Speaker 5>so that's just an example of I've found.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I happened to have spent a bunch of time</v>

1442
01:08:26.120 --> 01:08:27.380
<v Speaker 5>studying,</v>
<v Speaker 5>as I say,</v>

1443
01:08:27.381 --> 01:08:32.381
<v Speaker 5>history of science and one of my,</v>
<v Speaker 5>one of my hobbies is sort of history of </v>

1444
01:08:32.381 --> 01:08:36.251
<v Speaker 5>ideas.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I even wrote this little book called </v>

1445
01:08:36.251 --> 01:08:36.251
<v Speaker 5>idea makers,</v>
<v Speaker 5>which is about biographies of a bunch of</v>

1446
01:08:36.251 --> 01:08:37.940
<v Speaker 5>people who for one reason or another </v>
<v Speaker 5>I've written about.</v>

1447
01:08:38.210 --> 01:08:43.210
<v Speaker 5>And so I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm always curious about this thing </v>

1448
01:08:43.210 --> 01:08:43.400
<v Speaker 5>about how do people actually wind up </v>
<v Speaker 5>figuring out the things they figure out.</v>

1449
01:08:43.790 --> 01:08:45.350
<v Speaker 5>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>one of the,</v>

1450
01:08:45.560 --> 01:08:48.020
<v Speaker 5>one of the conclusions that my,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1451
01:08:48.021 --> 01:08:53.021
<v Speaker 5>investigations with many people is there</v>
<v Speaker 5>a very rarely moments of inspiration.</v>

1452
01:08:53.450 --> 01:08:58.450
<v Speaker 5>Usually it's long multi-decade kinds of </v>
<v Speaker 5>things which only later get compressed </v>

1453
01:08:58.761 --> 01:09:02.930
<v Speaker 5>into something short.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And also the path is often much,</v>

1454
01:09:03.590 --> 01:09:05.300
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1455
01:09:05.301 --> 01:09:06.230
<v Speaker 5>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's,</v>

1456
01:09:06.430 --> 01:09:08.060
<v Speaker 5>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's quite,</v>

1457
01:09:08.970 --> 01:09:11.750
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>can I say that the steps are quite small</v>

1458
01:09:11.960 --> 01:09:16.960
<v Speaker 5>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but the path is often kind of </v>

1459
01:09:16.960 --> 01:09:16.960
<v Speaker 5>complicated and that's what,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's what it's been for me.</v>

1460
01:09:16.960 --> 01:09:17.080
<v Speaker 5>So I.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Simple question,</v>

1461
01:09:17.081 --> 01:09:18.620
<v Speaker 5>complex answer,</v>
<v Speaker 5>sorry about that.</v>

1462
01:09:20.280 --> 01:09:21.880
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so,</v>

1463
01:09:21.881 --> 01:09:26.881
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>when I basically see it from the wall </v>

1464
01:09:26.881 --> 01:09:29.041
<v Speaker 5>from languages,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's a way to describe all of objective </v>

1465
01:09:29.041 --> 01:09:29.610
<v Speaker 5>reality.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's kind of formalizing your swabbed,</v>

1466
01:09:29.710 --> 01:09:32.330
<v Speaker 5>the entire domain of discourse,</v>
<v Speaker 5>user philosophical term.</v>

1467
01:09:32.331 --> 01:09:35.380
<v Speaker 5>And you kind of hinted at this in your,</v>
<v Speaker 5>a lecture where the,</v>

1468
01:09:35.410 --> 01:09:40.410
<v Speaker 5>where it sort of leaves offices that </v>
<v Speaker 5>when we start to talk about more </v>

1469
01:09:40.410 --> 01:09:40.410
<v Speaker 5>esoteric,</v>
<v Speaker 5>philosophical concepts,</v>

1470
01:09:40.410 --> 01:09:45.181
<v Speaker 5>purpose,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I guess this would lead to things like </v>

1471
01:09:45.181 --> 01:09:48.150
<v Speaker 5>epistemology because essentially you </v>
<v Speaker 5>only have signed there as amazing as </v>

1472
01:09:48.150 --> 01:09:51.421
<v Speaker 5>sciences.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There are other things that are talked </v>

1473
01:09:51.421 --> 01:09:51.421
<v Speaker 5>aboUt not,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1474
01:09:51.421 --> 01:09:52.210
<v Speaker 5>like idealism versus materialism,</v>
<v Speaker 5>etc.</v>

1475
01:09:52.690 --> 01:09:57.690
<v Speaker 5>Do you have an idea of how well from </v>
<v Speaker 5>might or might not be able to branch </v>

1476
01:09:57.690 --> 01:10:00.670
<v Speaker 5>into those discourses?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Because I'm hearing echoes in my head at</v>

1477
01:10:00.671 --> 01:10:03.250
<v Speaker 5>that time,</v>
<v Speaker 5>baal shem said that an ai needs a,</v>

1478
01:10:03.270 --> 01:10:04.900
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>when you give an ai a purpose,</v>

1479
01:10:04.901 --> 01:10:06.310
<v Speaker 5>there's like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think he said,</v>

1480
01:10:06.700 --> 01:10:11.700
<v Speaker 5>philosophers are divided completely </v>
<v Speaker 5>evenly between the top four ways to </v>

1481
01:10:11.700 --> 01:10:11.700
<v Speaker 5>measure how good something should be.</v>

1482
01:10:11.700 --> 01:10:14.290
<v Speaker 5>It's like utilitarianism and sugar are </v>
<v Speaker 5>the foremost japanese.</v>

1483
01:10:14.780 --> 01:10:15.160
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>

1484
01:10:15.550 --> 01:10:16.570
<v Speaker 5>So the first thing is,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

1485
01:10:16.571 --> 01:10:20.770
<v Speaker 5>this problem of making what about 300 </v>
<v Speaker 5>years ago,</v>

1486
01:10:20.771 --> 01:10:23.950
<v Speaker 5>people like live nets were interested in</v>
<v Speaker 5>the same problem that I'm interested in,</v>

1487
01:10:23.951 --> 01:10:28.951
<v Speaker 5>which is how do you formalize sort of </v>
<v Speaker 5>everyday discourse and live minutes had </v>

1488
01:10:28.951 --> 01:10:29.380
<v Speaker 5>the original idea,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1489
01:10:29.381 --> 01:10:34.381
<v Speaker 5>he was originally trained as a lawyer </v>
<v Speaker 5>and he had this idea if he could only </v>

1490
01:10:34.381 --> 01:10:37.000
<v Speaker 5>reduce all law,</v>
<v Speaker 5>all legal questions to matters of logic,</v>

1491
01:10:37.180 --> 01:10:42.180
<v Speaker 5>he could have a machine that would </v>
<v Speaker 5>basically describe the answer every </v>

1492
01:10:42.180 --> 01:10:44.800
<v Speaker 5>legal case.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He was unfortunately a few hundred years</v>

1493
01:10:44.801 --> 01:10:45.970
<v Speaker 5>too early.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>

1494
01:10:46.240 --> 01:10:47.470
<v Speaker 5>even though he did have,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1495
01:10:47.471 --> 01:10:49.420
<v Speaker 5>he tried to,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he tried to do all kinds of things,</v>

1496
01:10:49.421 --> 01:10:54.421
<v Speaker 5>very similar things I've tried to do,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like he tried to get various dukes to </v>

1497
01:10:54.421 --> 01:10:56.470
<v Speaker 5>assemble big libraries of data.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And stuff like this,</v>

1498
01:10:56.471 --> 01:10:57.820
<v Speaker 5>but,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but the point.</v>

1499
01:10:58.750 --> 01:11:03.750
<v Speaker 5>So what he tried to do was to make a </v>
<v Speaker 5>formalized representation of everyday </v>

1500
01:11:03.750 --> 01:11:06.460
<v Speaker 5>discourse for whatever reason for the </v>
<v Speaker 5>last 300 years.</v>

1501
01:11:06.461 --> 01:11:08.230
<v Speaker 5>Basically people haven't tried to do </v>
<v Speaker 5>that.</v>

1502
01:11:08.530 --> 01:11:11.320
<v Speaker 5>There's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's almost completely barren landscape.</v>

1503
01:11:11.680 --> 01:11:16.680
<v Speaker 5>There was this period of time in the 16 </v>
<v Speaker 5>hundredS when people talked about </v>

1504
01:11:16.680 --> 01:11:18.120
<v Speaker 5>philosophicAl languages.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Lightness was one.</v>

1505
01:11:18.121 --> 01:11:23.121
<v Speaker 5>A guy called John Wilkins was another </v>
<v Speaker 5>and they tried to break down human </v>

1506
01:11:23.221 --> 01:11:25.320
<v Speaker 5>thought into something.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Symbolic.</v>

1507
01:11:25.740 --> 01:11:27.450
<v Speaker 5>People haven't done that for a long </v>
<v Speaker 5>time.</v>

1508
01:11:27.990 --> 01:11:30.450
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>in terms of what can we do that with,</v>

1509
01:11:30.810 --> 01:11:31.830
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1510
01:11:32.100 --> 01:11:34.830
<v Speaker 5>I've been trying to figure out what the </v>
<v Speaker 5>best way to do it is.</v>

1511
01:11:34.831 --> 01:11:38.580
<v Speaker 5>I think it's actUally not as hard as one</v>
<v Speaker 5>might think these areas.</v>

1512
01:11:38.700 --> 01:11:43.700
<v Speaker 5>One thing you have to understand these </v>
<v Speaker 5>areas like philosophy and so on are </v>

1513
01:11:43.700 --> 01:11:44.670
<v Speaker 5>there on the harder end.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean things like,</v>

1514
01:11:44.980 --> 01:11:46.620
<v Speaker 5>good example,</v>
<v Speaker 5>typical example,</v>

1515
01:11:46.780 --> 01:11:48.570
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I want to have a piece of chocolate.</v>

1516
01:11:48.930 --> 01:11:51.840
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They in wolfram language right now,</v>

1517
01:11:51.841 --> 01:11:54.210
<v Speaker 5>we have a pretty good description of </v>
<v Speaker 5>pieces of chocolate.</v>

1518
01:11:54.540 --> 01:11:55.960
<v Speaker 5>We know all sorts of,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1519
01:11:55.980 --> 01:11:58.320
<v Speaker 5>we probably know 100 different kinds of </v>
<v Speaker 5>chocolate.</v>

1520
01:11:58.321 --> 01:12:03.321
<v Speaker 5>We know how big the pieces are,</v>
<v Speaker 5>all that kind of thing that I want part </v>

1521
01:12:03.321 --> 01:12:04.320
<v Speaker 5>of that sentence.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We can't do that right now.</v>

1522
01:12:04.640 --> 01:12:09.640
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but I don't think that's that hard and </v>

1523
01:12:09.640 --> 01:12:09.640
<v Speaker 5>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1524
01:12:09.640 --> 01:12:12.180
<v Speaker 5>that's now if you ask,</v>
<v Speaker 5>let's say we had,</v>

1525
01:12:12.240 --> 01:12:17.240
<v Speaker 5>I think the different thing you're </v>
<v Speaker 5>saying is let's say we had the </v>

1526
01:12:17.240 --> 01:12:18.900
<v Speaker 5>omnipotent ai so to speak,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that was able to,</v>

1527
01:12:18.901 --> 01:12:23.901
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>where we turn over the control of the </v>

1528
01:12:23.901 --> 01:12:24.390
<v Speaker 5>central bank to the ai return over all </v>
<v Speaker 5>these other things to the ai.</v>

1529
01:12:24.600 --> 01:12:28.200
<v Speaker 5>Then the question is we say to the ai </v>
<v Speaker 5>now do the right thing.</v>

1530
01:12:28.770 --> 01:12:32.820
<v Speaker 5>And then the problem with that is,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and this is why I talk about,</v>

1531
01:12:32.821 --> 01:12:35.130
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>creating ai constitutions and so on,</v>

1532
01:12:36.000 --> 01:12:38.520
<v Speaker 5>we have absolutely no idea what to do.</v>

1533
01:12:38.520 --> 01:12:41.280
<v Speaker 5>The right thing is supposed to mean.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And philosophers have been arguing about</v>

1534
01:12:41.281 --> 01:12:41.640
<v Speaker 5>that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

1535
01:12:41.710 --> 01:12:46.260
<v Speaker 5>utilitarianism is an example of that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>of one of the answers to that.</v>

1536
01:12:46.261 --> 01:12:48.240
<v Speaker 5>Although it's not a complete answer by </v>
<v Speaker 5>any means,</v>

1537
01:12:48.241 --> 01:12:51.090
<v Speaker 5>it's not really an answer.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's just a way of posing the question.</v>

1538
01:12:51.340 --> 01:12:53.070
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and so I think that the,</v>

1539
01:12:53.210 --> 01:12:54.090
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>one of,</v>

1540
01:12:54.110 --> 01:12:59.110
<v Speaker 5>one of the features of um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so I think it's a really hard problem </v>

1541
01:12:59.110 --> 01:12:59.680
<v Speaker 5>to,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1542
01:13:00.240 --> 01:13:03.060
<v Speaker 5>you think to yourself,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what should the ai constitution actually</v>

1543
01:13:03.061 --> 01:13:04.980
<v Speaker 5>say?</v>
<v Speaker 5>So first thing you might think is,</v>

1544
01:13:05.220 --> 01:13:10.220
<v Speaker 5>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there's going to be something like </v>

1545
01:13:10.220 --> 01:13:10.220
<v Speaker 5>asimov's laws of robotics that's going </v>
<v Speaker 5>to be one,</v>

1546
01:13:10.220 --> 01:13:11.670
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>golden rule for ais.</v>

1547
01:13:11.970 --> 01:13:14.490
<v Speaker 5>And if we just follow that golden rule </v>
<v Speaker 5>or we.</v>

1548
01:13:14.491 --> 01:13:15.600
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>okay,</v>

1549
01:13:15.900 --> 01:13:18.780
<v Speaker 5>I think that that is absolutely </v>
<v Speaker 5>impossible.</v>

1550
01:13:18.870 --> 01:13:23.870
<v Speaker 5>And in fact I think you can even sort of</v>
<v Speaker 5>mathematically prove that that's </v>

1551
01:13:23.870 --> 01:13:25.650
<v Speaker 5>impossible because I think as soon as </v>
<v Speaker 5>you have a system that,</v>

1552
01:13:26.280 --> 01:13:31.280
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>essentially what you're trying to do is </v>

1553
01:13:31.280 --> 01:13:31.280
<v Speaker 5>you're trying to put in constraints </v>
<v Speaker 5>that,</v>

1554
01:13:31.790 --> 01:13:36.790
<v Speaker 5>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 5>basically as soon as you have a system </v>

1555
01:13:36.790 --> 01:13:36.790
<v Speaker 5>that shows computational </v>
<v Speaker 5>irreplaceability,</v>

1556
01:13:36.790 --> 01:13:40.850
<v Speaker 5>I think it is inevitable that you have a</v>
<v Speaker 5>case of have unintended consequences of </v>

1557
01:13:41.161 --> 01:13:43.950
<v Speaker 5>things,</v>
<v Speaker 5>which means that you never get,</v>

1558
01:13:44.010 --> 01:13:49.010
<v Speaker 5>just say,</v>
<v Speaker 5>put everything in this one very nice </v>

1559
01:13:49.010 --> 01:13:49.010
<v Speaker 5>box.</v>

1560
01:13:49.010 --> 01:13:49.710
<v Speaker 5>You always have to say,</v>
<v Speaker 5>let's put on a patch here.</v>

1561
01:13:49.711 --> 01:13:54.711
<v Speaker 5>Let's put on a patch there.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And so on a version of this much more </v>

1562
01:13:54.711 --> 01:13:54.870
<v Speaker 5>abstract version of this girdle's </v>
<v Speaker 5>theorem.</v>

1563
01:13:55.290 --> 01:13:57.700
<v Speaker 5>So girdle's theorem is,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1564
01:13:57.720 --> 01:13:59.790
<v Speaker 5>it starts out by taking the,</v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

1565
01:14:00.000 --> 01:14:05.000
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's girls' therapist trying to talk </v>

1566
01:14:05.000 --> 01:14:06.210
<v Speaker 5>about integers and says,</v>
<v Speaker 5>start off with pianos,</v>

1567
01:14:06.211 --> 01:14:07.710
<v Speaker 5>axioms,</v>
<v Speaker 5>pianos,</v>

1568
01:14:07.711 --> 01:14:10.980
<v Speaker 5>axioms,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you might say in piano thought described</v>

1569
01:14:11.050 --> 01:14:13.510
<v Speaker 5>integers and nothing but the integers.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Okay?</v>

1570
01:14:13.540 --> 01:14:16.710
<v Speaker 5>So another thing that's provable from </v>
<v Speaker 5>pianos,</v>

1571
01:14:16.711 --> 01:14:19.150
<v Speaker 5>accidents will be true about integers </v>
<v Speaker 5>and vice versa.</v>

1572
01:14:19.240 --> 01:14:24.240
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 5>What girdle's theorem shows is that yoU </v>

1573
01:14:24.240 --> 01:14:24.240
<v Speaker 5>can,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that will never work,</v>

1574
01:14:24.240 --> 01:14:27.840
<v Speaker 5>that there are an infinite hierarchy of </v>
<v Speaker 5>patches that you have to put on two </v>

1575
01:14:27.840 --> 01:14:31.561
<v Speaker 5>pianos,</v>
<v Speaker 5>axioms if you want to describe the </v>

1576
01:14:31.561 --> 01:14:32.620
<v Speaker 5>integers and nothing but the integers.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And I think the same is true if you want</v>

1577
01:14:32.621 --> 01:14:36.730
<v Speaker 5>to have a legal system effectively that </v>
<v Speaker 5>has no bizarre,</v>

1578
01:14:36.731 --> 01:14:37.770
<v Speaker 5>unintended consequences.</v>

1579
01:14:37.790 --> 01:14:40.200
<v Speaker 5>I don't think it's possible to just say,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1580
01:14:40.210 --> 01:14:45.210
<v Speaker 5>if you,</v>
<v Speaker 5>when you're describing something in the </v>

1581
01:14:45.210 --> 01:14:45.610
<v Speaker 5>world that's complicated like that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't think it's possible to just have</v>

1582
01:14:45.850 --> 01:14:49.870
<v Speaker 5>a small set of rules that will always do</v>
<v Speaker 5>what we want.</v>

1583
01:14:49.871 --> 01:14:51.580
<v Speaker 5>So to speak.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think it's inevitable that you have to</v>

1584
01:14:51.581 --> 01:14:55.630
<v Speaker 5>have a long essentially code of laws and</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's what,</v>

1585
01:14:55.760 --> 01:15:00.760
<v Speaker 5>you know.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So my guess is that what we'll actually </v>

1586
01:15:00.760 --> 01:15:00.760
<v Speaker 5>have to happen is,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1587
01:15:00.760 --> 01:15:01.510
<v Speaker 5>as we try and describe what you,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we want the eyes to do,</v>

1588
01:15:02.440 --> 01:15:04.570
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't know the socio political aspects</v>

1589
01:15:04.571 --> 01:15:09.571
<v Speaker 5>of how we'll figure out whether it's one</v>
<v Speaker 5>ai constitution or one per,</v>

1590
01:15:10.930 --> 01:15:13.090
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>city or whatever.</v>

1591
01:15:13.870 --> 01:15:15.550
<v Speaker 5>We can talk about that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's a separate issue.</v>

1592
01:15:15.551 --> 01:15:16.300
<v Speaker 5>But,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but,</v>

1593
01:15:16.301 --> 01:15:17.190
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1594
01:15:17.260 --> 01:15:19.660
<v Speaker 5>I think what will happen is it'll be </v>
<v Speaker 5>much like human laws.</v>

1595
01:15:19.661 --> 01:15:22.180
<v Speaker 5>There'll be a complicated thing that </v>
<v Speaker 5>gets progressively patched.</v>

1596
01:15:22.510 --> 01:15:25.420
<v Speaker 5>And so I think it's some and these ideas</v>
<v Speaker 5>like,</v>

1597
01:15:25.750 --> 01:15:26.790
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1598
01:15:26.860 --> 01:15:28.420
<v Speaker 5>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we'll just make the eyes,</v>

1599
01:15:28.520 --> 01:15:30.730
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>run the world according to,</v>

1600
01:15:30.820 --> 01:15:32.630
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>mills,</v>

1601
01:15:32.750 --> 01:15:34.750
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>John Stuart mill's idea.</v>

1602
01:15:35.170 --> 01:15:38.590
<v Speaker 5>It's not going to work the best,</v>
<v Speaker 5>which is not surprising.</v>

1603
01:15:38.620 --> 01:15:39.970
<v Speaker 5>This philosophy has,</v>
<v Speaker 5>has,</v>

1604
01:15:40.120 --> 01:15:41.860
<v Speaker 5>has made the point that it's not as </v>
<v Speaker 5>easy,</v>

1605
01:15:41.890 --> 01:15:44.020
<v Speaker 5>not an easy problem for the last 2000 </v>
<v Speaker 5>years.</v>

1606
01:15:44.290 --> 01:15:46.330
<v Speaker 5>And they're right.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's not an easy problem.</v>

1607
01:15:47.110 --> 01:15:47.530
<v Speaker 5>Thank you.</v>

1608
01:15:49.200 --> 01:15:49.870
<v Speaker 7>I,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I'm,</v>

1609
01:15:50.300 --> 01:15:55.300
<v Speaker 7>you're talking about computational </v>
<v Speaker 7>reducibility and computational </v>

1610
01:15:55.300 --> 01:15:59.601
<v Speaker 7>equivalent and also that earlier on in </v>
<v Speaker 7>your intellectual adventures you're </v>

1611
01:15:59.601 --> 01:16:01.680
<v Speaker 7>interested in particle physics and </v>
<v Speaker 7>things like that.</v>

1612
01:16:02.670 --> 01:16:07.670
<v Speaker 7>I've heard you make the comment before </v>
<v Speaker 7>and in other contexts that things like </v>

1613
01:16:08.131 --> 01:16:13.131
<v Speaker 7>molecules compute and I was curious to </v>
<v Speaker 7>ask you exactly what you mean by that.</v>

1614
01:16:13.441 --> 01:16:14.090
<v Speaker 7>In what sense does,</v>

1615
01:16:16.390 --> 01:16:21.390
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what would you like to compute so to </v>

1616
01:16:21.390 --> 01:16:22.180
<v Speaker 5>speak?</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean in other words,</v>

1617
01:16:22.200 --> 01:16:27.200
<v Speaker 5>you what,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what is the case is that no one </v>

1618
01:16:27.581 --> 01:16:31.180
<v Speaker 5>definition of your computing is given a </v>
<v Speaker 5>particular computation like,</v>

1619
01:16:31.181 --> 01:16:36.181
<v Speaker 5>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>finding square roots or something you </v>

1620
01:16:36.181 --> 01:16:39.270
<v Speaker 5>can program.</v>
<v Speaker 5>A surprising thing is that an awful lot </v>

1621
01:16:39.341 --> 01:16:44.341
<v Speaker 5>of stuff can be programmed to do any </v>
<v Speaker 5>computation you want that some,</v>

1622
01:16:45.670 --> 01:16:46.810
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>when it comes to.</v>

1623
01:16:46.811 --> 01:16:51.811
<v Speaker 5>I mean I think for example,</v>
<v Speaker 5>when you look at nanotechnology and so </v>

1624
01:16:51.811 --> 01:16:51.811
<v Speaker 5>on,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the,</v>

1625
01:16:51.811 --> 01:16:51.820
<v Speaker 5>the,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the current,</v>

1626
01:16:52.180 --> 01:16:57.180
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>one of the current belief says to make </v>

1627
01:16:57.180 --> 01:16:59.791
<v Speaker 5>very small computers,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you should take what we know about </v>

1628
01:16:59.791 --> 01:17:00.940
<v Speaker 5>making big computers and just,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1629
01:17:01.330 --> 01:17:06.330
<v Speaker 5>make them smaller so to speak.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't think that's the approach you </v>

1630
01:17:06.330 --> 01:17:07.390
<v Speaker 5>have to use.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think you can take the components that</v>

1631
01:17:07.391 --> 01:17:12.391
<v Speaker 5>exist at a lot of molecules and say,</v>
<v Speaker 5>how do we assemble those components to </v>

1632
01:17:12.921 --> 01:17:14.480
<v Speaker 5>be able to do complicated computations?</v>

1633
01:17:14.480 --> 01:17:16.820
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's likely cellular automata that the,</v>

1634
01:17:17.000 --> 01:17:22.000
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the underlying rule for the seller </v>

1635
01:17:22.000 --> 01:17:24.140
<v Speaker 5>automaton is very simple.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yet when that rule is applied,</v>

1636
01:17:24.141 --> 01:17:26.660
<v Speaker 5>many times it can do a sophisticated </v>
<v Speaker 5>computation.</v>

1637
01:17:26.870 --> 01:17:29.360
<v Speaker 5>So I think that that's the,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's the sense in which,</v>

1638
01:17:31.220 --> 01:17:36.220
<v Speaker 5>what can I say,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the raw material that you need for </v>

1639
01:17:36.220 --> 01:17:36.280
<v Speaker 5>computation can be,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1640
01:17:36.290 --> 01:17:41.290
<v Speaker 5>there's a great diversity and the raw </v>
<v Speaker 5>material that you can use for </v>

1641
01:17:41.290 --> 01:17:41.600
<v Speaker 5>computation.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Our particular human development,</v>

1642
01:17:41.640 --> 01:17:42.530
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>stack of,</v>

1643
01:17:42.620 --> 01:17:43.930
<v Speaker 5>of,</v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

1644
01:17:43.940 --> 01:17:48.940
<v Speaker 5>of technologies that we use for </v>
<v Speaker 5>computation right now is just one </v>

1645
01:17:48.940 --> 01:17:48.940
<v Speaker 5>particular path.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And we can,</v>

1646
01:17:48.940 --> 01:17:53.320
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so a very practical example of this is </v>

1647
01:17:53.320 --> 01:17:55.481
<v Speaker 5>algorithmic drugs.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So the question is right now drugs </v>

1648
01:17:55.481 --> 01:17:56.720
<v Speaker 5>pretty much work by most drugs work by,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1649
01:17:56.721 --> 01:17:59.690
<v Speaker 5>there is a binding site on a molecule,</v>
<v Speaker 5>drug fits into binding site,</v>

1650
01:17:59.691 --> 01:18:01.490
<v Speaker 5>does something.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The question is,</v>

1651
01:18:01.640 --> 01:18:06.640
<v Speaker 5>can you imagine having something where </v>
<v Speaker 5>the molecule is something which has </v>

1652
01:18:06.640 --> 01:18:11.320
<v Speaker 5>computations going on in it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>where it goes around and it looks at </v>

1653
01:18:11.320 --> 01:18:11.320
<v Speaker 5>that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1654
01:18:11.320 --> 01:18:13.280
<v Speaker 5>that thing it's supposed to be binding </v>
<v Speaker 5>to and it figures out,</v>

1655
01:18:13.281 --> 01:18:18.281
<v Speaker 5>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there's this knob here and that knob </v>

1656
01:18:18.281 --> 01:18:18.281
<v Speaker 5>there,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it reconfigures itself.</v>

1657
01:18:18.281 --> 01:18:20.000
<v Speaker 5>It's computing something.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's trying to figure out,</v>

1658
01:18:20.001 --> 01:18:25.001
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>is this likely to be a tumor cell or </v>

1659
01:18:25.001 --> 01:18:25.001
<v Speaker 5>whatever based on some more complicated </v>
<v Speaker 5>thing.</v>

1660
01:18:25.001 --> 01:18:28.460
<v Speaker 5>That's the type of thing that I mean by,</v>
<v Speaker 5>by computations happening at a scale.</v>

1661
01:18:28.700 --> 01:18:33.700
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I guess I meant to ask if it follows </v>

1662
01:18:33.700 --> 01:18:36.731
<v Speaker 5>from that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>if in your view like the molecules in </v>

1663
01:18:36.731 --> 01:18:40.721
<v Speaker 5>the track board and in my face and in </v>
<v Speaker 5>the table are in any sense currently </v>

1664
01:18:40.721 --> 01:18:43.010
<v Speaker 5>during doing computer.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean the question of what computation.</v>

1665
01:18:43.011 --> 01:18:45.050
<v Speaker 5>Look,</v>
<v Speaker 5>one of the things to realize if you look</v>

1666
01:18:45.051 --> 01:18:47.990
<v Speaker 5>at kind of the sort of past and future </v>
<v Speaker 5>of things,</v>

1667
01:18:48.260 --> 01:18:49.700
<v Speaker 5>the,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the um.</v>

1668
01:18:50.690 --> 01:18:51.770
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So here's an observation.</v>

1669
01:18:51.771 --> 01:18:55.250
<v Speaker 5>Actually I was about leipnetz actually.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Enlightenment says time.</v>

1670
01:18:55.251 --> 01:18:59.690
<v Speaker 5>Leipnetz made a,</v>
<v Speaker 5>a calculator type computer out of bras.</v>

1671
01:18:59.870 --> 01:19:01.460
<v Speaker 5>Took them 30 years.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>

1672
01:19:01.670 --> 01:19:03.760
<v Speaker 5>So in his day there was,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1673
01:19:03.800 --> 01:19:06.680
<v Speaker 5>at most one computer in the world as far</v>
<v Speaker 5>as he was concerned,</v>

1674
01:19:06.681 --> 01:19:07.040
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

1675
01:19:07.370 --> 01:19:09.320
<v Speaker 5>Today's world,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there may be 10 billion computers,</v>

1676
01:19:09.321 --> 01:19:11.270
<v Speaker 5>maybe 20 billion computers.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't know.</v>

1677
01:19:11.810 --> 01:19:13.820
<v Speaker 5>The question is what's that gonna look </v>
<v Speaker 5>like in the future?</v>

1678
01:19:14.260 --> 01:19:19.260
<v Speaker 5>And I think the answer is that in time </v>
<v Speaker 5>probably everything we have will be made</v>

1679
01:19:19.611 --> 01:19:23.420
<v Speaker 5>of computers and the following sense </v>
<v Speaker 5>that basically it won't be,</v>

1680
01:19:23.421 --> 01:19:25.160
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>in today's world things are made of,</v>

1681
01:19:25.161 --> 01:19:26.210
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>metal,</v>

1682
01:19:26.211 --> 01:19:27.560
<v Speaker 5>plastic,</v>
<v Speaker 5>whatever else.</v>

1683
01:19:27.800 --> 01:19:32.800
<v Speaker 5>But actually that won't make it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There won't be any point in doing that </v>

1684
01:19:32.800 --> 01:19:32.800
<v Speaker 5>once we know how to do,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1685
01:19:32.800 --> 01:19:34.970
<v Speaker 5>I'm not a killer scale manufacturing and</v>
<v Speaker 5>so on.</v>

1686
01:19:35.180 --> 01:19:37.940
<v Speaker 5>We might as well just make everything </v>
<v Speaker 5>out of programmable stuff.</v>

1687
01:19:38.480 --> 01:19:40.880
<v Speaker 5>And I think that's a,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's a sense in which,</v>

1688
01:19:41.180 --> 01:19:41.700
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the,</v>

1689
01:19:41.701 --> 01:19:42.190
<v Speaker 5>the,</v>
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

1690
01:19:42.910 --> 01:19:47.910
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the one example we have molecular </v>

1691
01:19:47.910 --> 01:19:47.910
<v Speaker 5>computing right now is us bio and </v>
<v Speaker 5>biology.</v>

1692
01:19:47.910 --> 01:19:51.830
<v Speaker 5>Biology does a reasonable job of </v>
<v Speaker 5>specific kinds of molecular computing.</v>

1693
01:19:52.140 --> 01:19:53.450
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's kind of embarrassing.</v>

1694
01:19:53.451 --> 01:19:54.970
<v Speaker 5>I think that the only,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1695
01:19:55.160 --> 01:19:59.030
<v Speaker 5>molecule we know that sort of a memory </v>
<v Speaker 5>molecule is dna and it's kind of,</v>

1696
01:19:59.090 --> 01:20:00.320
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>which is kind of the,</v>

1697
01:20:00.580 --> 01:20:05.580
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the particular biological solution in </v>

1698
01:20:05.580 --> 01:20:05.580
<v Speaker 5>time.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We'll know lots of others and um,</v>

1699
01:20:05.580 --> 01:20:06.150
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think the,</v>

1700
01:20:06.151 --> 01:20:06.640
<v Speaker 5>the,</v>
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

1701
01:20:06.830 --> 01:20:10.710
<v Speaker 5>sort of the end point is so if you're </v>
<v Speaker 5>asking is,</v>

1702
01:20:11.020 --> 01:20:14.010
<v Speaker 5>is computation going on in this water </v>
<v Speaker 5>bottle?</v>

1703
01:20:14.011 --> 01:20:19.011
<v Speaker 5>The answer is absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's probably even many aspects of that </v>

1704
01:20:19.011 --> 01:20:19.011
<v Speaker 5>computation,</v>
<v Speaker 5>a pretty sophisticated.</v>

1705
01:20:19.011 --> 01:20:21.780
<v Speaker 5>If we wanted to know what would happen </v>
<v Speaker 5>to particular molecules here,</v>

1706
01:20:21.781 --> 01:20:26.781
<v Speaker 5>it's going to be hard to tell there's </v>
<v Speaker 5>going to be computational </v>

1707
01:20:26.781 --> 01:20:29.250
<v Speaker 5>reproducibility and so on.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Can we make use of that for our human </v>

1708
01:20:29.250 --> 01:20:32.660
<v Speaker 5>purposes?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Can we piggyback on that to achieve </v>

1709
01:20:32.660 --> 01:20:34.410
<v Speaker 5>something technological that's different</v>
<v Speaker 5>issue and that's the for that we have to</v>

1710
01:20:34.411 --> 01:20:38.700
<v Speaker 5>build up this whole sort of chain of,</v>
<v Speaker 5>of technology to be able to connect it,</v>

1711
01:20:38.880 --> 01:20:43.880
<v Speaker 5>which is what I've kind of been been </v>
<v Speaker 5>keep on talking about is how do we </v>

1712
01:20:43.880 --> 01:20:47.361
<v Speaker 5>connect sort of what is possible </v>
<v Speaker 5>computationally in the universe to what </v>

1713
01:20:47.361 --> 01:20:51.570
<v Speaker 5>we humans can kind of conceptualize that</v>
<v Speaker 5>we want to do in computation and that's,</v>

1714
01:20:51.780 --> 01:20:56.780
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's the bridge that we have to make </v>

1715
01:20:56.780 --> 01:20:56.780
<v Speaker 5>and that's the hard part.</v>

1716
01:20:56.780 --> 01:20:56.970
<v Speaker 5>but getting the intrinsic,</v>
<v Speaker 5>getting the computation done is,</v>

1717
01:20:57.300 --> 01:20:58.360
<v Speaker 5>is um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1718
01:20:58.710 --> 01:21:00.900
<v Speaker 5>those computation going on all over the </v>
<v Speaker 5>place.</v>

1719
01:21:01.540 --> 01:21:06.540
<v Speaker 5>But maybe a couple more questions.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I was hoping you could elaborate on what</v>

1720
01:21:07.191 --> 01:21:12.191
<v Speaker 5>you were talking about earlier of like </v>
<v Speaker 5>searching the entire space of possible </v>

1721
01:21:12.191 --> 01:21:14.790
<v Speaker 5>programs.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So that's very broad.</v>

1722
01:21:14.791 --> 01:21:19.791
<v Speaker 5>So maybe like what kind of searching of </v>
<v Speaker 5>that space we're good at and what we're </v>

1723
01:21:19.981 --> 01:21:22.200
<v Speaker 5>not.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And I guess what I mean,</v>

1724
01:21:22.320 --> 01:21:25.770
<v Speaker 5>I would say that we're at an early stage</v>
<v Speaker 5>and not knowing how to do that.</v>

1725
01:21:25.950 --> 01:21:30.950
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So I've done lots of these things and </v>

1726
01:21:30.950 --> 01:21:33.750
<v Speaker 5>they are the thing that I've noticed is </v>
<v Speaker 5>if you do an exhaustive search,</v>

1727
01:21:34.230 --> 01:21:36.960
<v Speaker 5>then you don't miss even things that you</v>
<v Speaker 5>weren't looking for.</v>

1728
01:21:37.740 --> 01:21:42.740
<v Speaker 5>If you do a non exhaustive search,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there is a tremendous tendency to miss </v>

1729
01:21:42.740 --> 01:21:44.520
<v Speaker 5>things that you weren't looking for.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>

1730
01:21:44.880 --> 01:21:46.920
<v Speaker 5>and so,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1731
01:21:46.980 --> 01:21:51.980
<v Speaker 5>we've done such as a bunch of function </v>
<v Speaker 5>evaluation and wolfram language is done </v>

1732
01:21:51.980 --> 01:21:56.511
<v Speaker 5>by,</v>
<v Speaker 5>was done by searching for optimal </v>

1733
01:21:56.511 --> 01:21:59.061
<v Speaker 5>approximations in some big space,</v>
<v Speaker 5>a bunch of stuff with hashing has done </v>

1734
01:21:59.061 --> 01:21:59.220
<v Speaker 5>that way.</v>

1735
01:21:59.370 --> 01:22:04.370
<v Speaker 5>A bunch of image processing is done that</v>
<v Speaker 5>way where we're just sort of searching </v>

1736
01:22:04.370 --> 01:22:07.760
<v Speaker 5>this,</v>
<v Speaker 5>doing exhaustive searches and maybe </v>

1737
01:22:07.760 --> 01:22:08.280
<v Speaker 5>trillions of programs to find things.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Now,</v>

1738
01:22:08.340 --> 01:22:09.330
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there is,</v>

1739
01:22:09.331 --> 01:22:14.210
<v Speaker 5>on the other side of that story is the </v>
<v Speaker 5>incremental improvements story with,</v>

1740
01:22:14.240 --> 01:22:17.250
<v Speaker 5>with deep learning and neural networks </v>
<v Speaker 5>and so on,</v>

1741
01:22:17.460 --> 01:22:19.670
<v Speaker 5>where because there is differentiability</v>
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

1742
01:22:20.220 --> 01:22:23.640
<v Speaker 5>you're able to sort of incrementally get</v>
<v Speaker 5>to a better solution.</v>

1743
01:22:23.910 --> 01:22:28.910
<v Speaker 5>Now in fact,</v>
<v Speaker 5>people are making less and less </v>

1744
01:22:28.910 --> 01:22:29.220
<v Speaker 5>differentiability and deep learning </v>
<v Speaker 5>neural nets.</v>

1745
01:22:29.520 --> 01:22:32.240
<v Speaker 5>And so I think eventually there's going </v>
<v Speaker 5>to be sort of a,</v>

1746
01:22:32.320 --> 01:22:35.430
<v Speaker 5>a grand unification of these kinds of </v>
<v Speaker 5>approaches.</v>

1747
01:22:36.420 --> 01:22:38.160
<v Speaker 5>Right now we're still,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1748
01:22:38.161 --> 01:22:40.740
<v Speaker 5>I don't really know what the,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1749
01:22:40.770 --> 01:22:45.770
<v Speaker 5>the exhaustive search side of things,</v>
<v Speaker 5>which you can use for all sorts of </v>

1750
01:22:45.770 --> 01:22:45.770
<v Speaker 5>purposes.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

1751
01:22:45.770 --> 01:22:50.150
<v Speaker 5>there's the reason,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the surprising thing that makes </v>

1752
01:22:50.150 --> 01:22:52.510
<v Speaker 5>exhaustive search not crazy is that </v>
<v Speaker 5>there is rich sophisticated stuff near </v>

1753
01:22:53.641 --> 01:22:57.450
<v Speaker 5>at hand and the computational universe,</v>
<v Speaker 5>if you had to go quadrillions,</v>

1754
01:22:57.540 --> 01:23:02.540
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>through a quadrillion cases before you </v>

1755
01:23:02.540 --> 01:23:02.540
<v Speaker 5>ever found a thing.</v>

1756
01:23:02.540 --> 01:23:04.800
<v Speaker 5>Exhaustive search will be hopeless,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but you don't in many cases.</v>

1757
01:23:05.110 --> 01:23:06.200
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and uh,</v>

1758
01:23:06.270 --> 01:23:11.270
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I would say that we are in a fairly </v>

1759
01:23:11.270 --> 01:23:13.231
<v Speaker 5>primitive stage of the,</v>
<v Speaker 5>of the science of how to do those such </v>

1760
01:23:13.231 --> 01:23:13.231
<v Speaker 5>as.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well.</v>

1761
01:23:13.231 --> 01:23:15.040
<v Speaker 5>My guess is that there'll be some sort </v>
<v Speaker 5>of unification,</v>

1762
01:23:15.041 --> 01:23:20.041
<v Speaker 5>which needless to say,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I've thought a bunch about between kind </v>

1763
01:23:20.041 --> 01:23:23.971
<v Speaker 5>of the norm.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That tradeoff typically in neural net </v>

1764
01:23:23.971 --> 01:23:27.370
<v Speaker 5>says you can have a neural net that is </v>
<v Speaker 5>very good at that is uses it's </v>

1765
01:23:27.370 --> 01:23:29.140
<v Speaker 5>computational resources.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

1766
01:23:29.200 --> 01:23:34.200
<v Speaker 5>but it's really hard to train.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Or you can have a neural net that </v>

1767
01:23:34.200 --> 01:23:34.330
<v Speaker 5>doesn't use this computational resources</v>
<v Speaker 5>so well,</v>

1768
01:23:34.390 --> 01:23:39.110
<v Speaker 5>but it's very easy to train because it's</v>
<v Speaker 5>very smoothly and you know,</v>

1769
01:23:39.200 --> 01:23:44.200
<v Speaker 5>my guess is that somewhere in the harder</v>
<v Speaker 5>to train but makes use of things that </v>

1770
01:23:45.041 --> 01:23:50.041
<v Speaker 5>are to the complete computational </v>
<v Speaker 5>universe is where one's going to see </v>

1771
01:23:50.041 --> 01:23:50.630
<v Speaker 5>progress,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but it's,</v>

1772
01:23:50.631 --> 01:23:55.631
<v Speaker 5>it's a,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's a really interesting area and I </v>

1773
01:23:55.631 --> 01:23:57.670
<v Speaker 5>consider us own it at the beginning of </v>
<v Speaker 5>figuring that out.</v>

1774
01:23:58.220 --> 01:23:59.470
<v Speaker 5>The one last question.</v>

1775
01:24:01.010 --> 01:24:04.670
<v Speaker 8>Keep going.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Thank you for your talk.</v>

1776
01:24:04.730 --> 01:24:06.860
<v Speaker 8>I just to give a bit of context for my </v>
<v Speaker 8>question,</v>

1777
01:24:07.070 --> 01:24:12.070
<v Speaker 8>I researched how we could teach ai </v>
<v Speaker 8>toolkits and evolving platforms for </v>

1778
01:24:12.070 --> 01:24:15.551
<v Speaker 8>that.</v>
<v Speaker 8>How we could teach artificial </v>

1779
01:24:15.551 --> 01:24:16.751
<v Speaker 8>intelligence and machine learning to </v>
<v Speaker 8>children and I know you develop </v>

1780
01:24:16.751 --> 01:24:19.541
<v Speaker 8>resources for that as well.</v>
<v Speaker 8>So I was wondering like where do you </v>

1781
01:24:19.581 --> 01:24:24.581
<v Speaker 8>think it's problematic that we have </v>
<v Speaker 8>computation that is very efficient and </v>

1782
01:24:24.581 --> 01:24:26.480
<v Speaker 8>can promote utd darien and problem </v>
<v Speaker 8>solving perspective?</v>

1783
01:24:26.920 --> 01:24:30.270
<v Speaker 8>It achieves all the goals but we don't </v>
<v Speaker 8>understand that how we have it worked.</v>

1784
01:24:30.271 --> 01:24:35.271
<v Speaker 8>So we have to create this fake steps and</v>
<v Speaker 8>if he could think of scenarios where </v>

1785
01:24:35.271 --> 01:24:40.061
<v Speaker 8>that could become very problematic over </v>
<v Speaker 8>time and why do we approach it such and </v>

1786
01:24:40.061 --> 01:24:44.220
<v Speaker 8>such a deterministic way.</v>
<v Speaker 8>And when you mentioned that </v>

1787
01:24:44.220 --> 01:24:44.920
<v Speaker 8>computational intelligence are </v>
<v Speaker 8>differentiated by this,</v>

1788
01:24:44.921 --> 01:24:49.921
<v Speaker 8>like very thin line,</v>
<v Speaker 8>how does that affect the way you learn </v>

1789
01:24:49.921 --> 01:24:51.170
<v Speaker 8>and how do you think that will affect </v>
<v Speaker 8>the way we learn?</v>

1790
01:24:51.171 --> 01:24:51.480
<v Speaker 8>We learn.</v>

1791
01:24:52.040 --> 01:24:54.570
<v Speaker 5>So I mean look,</v>
<v Speaker 5>my general principle about,</v>

1792
01:24:55.550 --> 01:25:00.550
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>future generations and what they should </v>

1793
01:25:00.550 --> 01:25:00.550
<v Speaker 5>learn.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

1794
01:25:00.550 --> 01:25:02.871
<v Speaker 5>first point is very obvious point that </v>
<v Speaker 5>for every field that people study </v>

1795
01:25:04.740 --> 01:25:09.740
<v Speaker 5>archaeology to zoology,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there either is now a computational x or</v>

1796
01:25:09.961 --> 01:25:11.870
<v Speaker 5>there will be soon.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So you know,</v>

1797
01:25:11.970 --> 01:25:16.970
<v Speaker 5>every field,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the paradigm of computation is becoming </v>

1798
01:25:16.970 --> 01:25:21.531
<v Speaker 5>important,</v>
<v Speaker 5>perhaps the dominant paradigm in that </v>

1799
01:25:21.531 --> 01:25:21.531
<v Speaker 5>field.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>

1800
01:25:21.531 --> 01:25:24.861
<v Speaker 5>So how do you teach kids to be useful in</v>
<v Speaker 5>a world where everything is </v>

1801
01:25:24.861 --> 01:25:28.911
<v Speaker 5>computational?</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think the number one thing is to teach</v>

1802
01:25:29.671 --> 01:25:32.100
<v Speaker 5>them how to think in computational </v>
<v Speaker 5>terms.</v>

1803
01:25:32.490 --> 01:25:37.490
<v Speaker 5>What does that mean?</v>
<v Speaker 5>It doesn't mean writing code </v>

1804
01:25:37.490 --> 01:25:37.490
<v Speaker 5>necessarily.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

1805
01:25:37.490 --> 01:25:39.000
<v Speaker 5>in other words,</v>
<v Speaker 5>one of the things that's happening right</v>

1806
01:25:39.001 --> 01:25:40.890
<v Speaker 5>now as a practical matter,</v>
<v Speaker 5>as you know,</v>

1807
01:25:40.891 --> 01:25:44.340
<v Speaker 5>there've been these waves of enthusiasm </v>
<v Speaker 5>for teaching coding of various kinds.</v>

1808
01:25:44.610 --> 01:25:45.250
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we're in a.</v>

1809
01:25:45.320 --> 01:25:48.330
<v Speaker 5>We're not actually,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we're in the end of an uptick wave.</v>

1810
01:25:48.330 --> 01:25:51.290
<v Speaker 5>I think it's going down again,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1811
01:25:51.330 --> 01:25:53.730
<v Speaker 5>it's been up and down for 40 years or </v>
<v Speaker 5>so.</v>

1812
01:25:54.860 --> 01:25:56.520
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Why doesn't that work?</v>

1813
01:25:56.850 --> 01:26:01.850
<v Speaker 5>What doesn't work?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Because while there are people like </v>

1814
01:26:01.850 --> 01:26:01.850
<v Speaker 5>people who are students at mit for </v>
<v Speaker 5>example,</v>

1815
01:26:01.850 --> 01:26:06.740
<v Speaker 5>for whom they really to learn </v>
<v Speaker 5>engineering style coding and it really </v>

1816
01:26:06.740 --> 01:26:09.890
<v Speaker 5>makes sense to them to learn that the </v>
<v Speaker 5>vast majority of people,</v>

1817
01:26:09.920 --> 01:26:13.340
<v Speaker 5>it's just not going to be irrelevant </v>
<v Speaker 5>because they're not going to write a low</v>

1818
01:26:13.341 --> 01:26:18.341
<v Speaker 5>level c program or something.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And it's the same thing that's happened </v>

1819
01:26:18.341 --> 01:26:19.940
<v Speaker 5>in math education,</v>
<v Speaker 5>which has been sort of a disaster there.</v>

1820
01:26:20.180 --> 01:26:25.180
<v Speaker 5>Which is the number one takeaway for </v>
<v Speaker 5>most people from the math they learn in </v>

1821
01:26:25.180 --> 01:26:28.730
<v Speaker 5>school is I don't like math.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And you know,</v>

1822
01:26:28.790 --> 01:26:31.190
<v Speaker 5>that's not for all of them obviously,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but that's the,</v>

1823
01:26:31.191 --> 01:26:33.590
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>if you asked a general scale,</v>

1824
01:26:33.770 --> 01:26:35.720
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what people and why is that?</v>

1825
01:26:35.720 --> 01:26:40.720
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>part of the reason is because what's </v>

1826
01:26:40.720 --> 01:26:40.720
<v Speaker 5>been taught is rather low level and </v>
<v Speaker 5>mechanical.</v>

1827
01:26:40.720 --> 01:26:42.890
<v Speaker 5>It's not about mathematical thinking </v>
<v Speaker 5>particularly.</v>

1828
01:26:43.070 --> 01:26:48.070
<v Speaker 5>It's mostly about what teachers can </v>
<v Speaker 5>teach and what assessment processes can </v>

1829
01:26:48.070 --> 01:26:48.320
<v Speaker 5>assess and so on.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>

1830
01:26:48.321 --> 01:26:51.170
<v Speaker 5>So how should one teach computational </v>
<v Speaker 5>thinking?</v>

1831
01:26:51.171 --> 01:26:51.620
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm,</v>

1832
01:26:51.680 --> 01:26:55.460
<v Speaker 5>I'm kind of excited about what we can do</v>
<v Speaker 5>with wolfram language because I think we</v>

1833
01:26:55.461 --> 01:26:59.930
<v Speaker 5>have a high enough level language that </v>
<v Speaker 5>people can actually write,</v>

1834
01:27:00.200 --> 01:27:01.490
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that for example,</v>

1835
01:27:01.491 --> 01:27:05.990
<v Speaker 5>I reckon by age 11 or 12,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and I've done many experiments on this,</v>

1836
01:27:05.991 --> 01:27:10.991
<v Speaker 5>so I have some,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the only problem with my experiments as </v>

1837
01:27:10.991 --> 01:27:12.590
<v Speaker 5>most of my experiments end up being with</v>
<v Speaker 5>kids who are high achieving kids,</v>

1838
01:27:13.040 --> 01:27:15.530
<v Speaker 5>despite many efforts to reach lower </v>
<v Speaker 5>achieving kids,</v>

1839
01:27:15.531 --> 01:27:19.760
<v Speaker 5>that always ends up that the kids who </v>
<v Speaker 5>actually do the things that I set up for</v>

1840
01:27:19.810 --> 01:27:20.860
<v Speaker 5>the high achieving kids.</v>
<v Speaker 5>but,</v>

1841
01:27:20.861 --> 01:27:23.180
<v Speaker 5>but setting that aside,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1842
01:27:23.240 --> 01:27:26.970
<v Speaker 5>you take the typical um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

1843
01:27:27.050 --> 01:27:27.740
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>11,</v>

1844
01:27:27.741 --> 01:27:29.300
<v Speaker 5>12,</v>
<v Speaker 5>13 year olds and so on,</v>

1845
01:27:29.630 --> 01:27:33.140
<v Speaker 5>and they can learn how to write stuff in</v>
<v Speaker 5>this language.</v>

1846
01:27:33.200 --> 01:27:36.260
<v Speaker 5>And what's interesting is they learn to </v>
<v Speaker 5>start thinking here,</v>

1847
01:27:36.290 --> 01:27:37.790
<v Speaker 5>I'll show you.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Let's be very practical.</v>

1848
01:27:37.791 --> 01:27:42.791
<v Speaker 5>I can show you.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I was doing every sunday I do a little </v>

1849
01:27:42.791 --> 01:27:44.450
<v Speaker 5>little thing with some middle school </v>
<v Speaker 5>kids and I might even be able to find my</v>

1850
01:27:44.451 --> 01:27:46.140
<v Speaker 5>stuff from yesterday.</v>
<v Speaker 5>This is,</v>

1851
01:27:46.141 --> 01:27:46.720
<v Speaker 5>this is,</v>
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

1852
01:27:46.820 --> 01:27:47.750
<v Speaker 5>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Let's see.</v>

1853
01:27:48.680 --> 01:27:52.580
<v Speaker 5>Programming adventures sharing 20 days.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Okay,</v>

1854
01:27:52.581 --> 01:27:53.960
<v Speaker 5>let's see what I did.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>

1855
01:27:53.961 --> 01:27:54.770
<v Speaker 5>look at that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That was,</v>

1856
01:27:54.771 --> 01:27:59.771
<v Speaker 5>that was why I thought of the south </v>
<v Speaker 5>America thing here because I had just </v>

1857
01:27:59.771 --> 01:27:59.771
<v Speaker 5>done that with these kids.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>

1858
01:27:59.771 --> 01:28:00.260
<v Speaker 5>the,</v>
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

1859
01:28:01.460 --> 01:28:03.170
<v Speaker 5>and so,</v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

1860
01:28:03.230 --> 01:28:06.440
<v Speaker 5>what are we doing?</v>
<v Speaker 5>We were trying to figure out this,</v>

1861
01:28:06.670 --> 01:28:11.670
<v Speaker 5>this.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm trying to figure out the shortest </v>

1862
01:28:11.670 --> 01:28:15.491
<v Speaker 5>tour thing that I just showed you,</v>
<v Speaker 5>which is this is how I got where I got </v>

1863
01:28:15.491 --> 01:28:16.760
<v Speaker 5>what to show you is,</v>
<v Speaker 5>is what I was doing with these kids.</v>

1864
01:28:16.761 --> 01:28:19.070
<v Speaker 5>But this,</v>
<v Speaker 5>this wAs my version of this.</v>

1865
01:28:19.070 --> 01:28:22.640
<v Speaker 5>But the kids all had various different </v>
<v Speaker 5>versions of this and we had,</v>

1866
01:28:22.641 --> 01:28:24.470
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>somebody suggested,</v>

1867
01:28:25.130 --> 01:28:30.130
<v Speaker 5>let's just enumerate,</v>
<v Speaker 5>let's just look at all possible </v>

1868
01:28:30.130 --> 01:28:33.530
<v Speaker 5>permutations of these cities and figure </v>
<v Speaker 5>out what their distances are.</v>

1869
01:28:33.531 --> 01:28:36.830
<v Speaker 5>There's the histograM of those.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's what we get from those.</v>

1870
01:28:36.831 --> 01:28:39.380
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 5>How do you get the largest distance from</v>

1871
01:28:39.381 --> 01:28:39.980
<v Speaker 5>those,</v>
<v Speaker 5>et cetera.</v>

1872
01:28:39.981 --> 01:28:40.670
<v Speaker 5>Terror,</v>
<v Speaker 5>terror.</v>

1873
01:28:40.970 --> 01:28:42.890
<v Speaker 5>And this is okay.</v>
<v Speaker 5>This was my version of that.</v>

1874
01:28:42.960 --> 01:28:46.730
<v Speaker 5>The kids had similar stuff and this is,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1875
01:28:46.790 --> 01:28:47.810
<v Speaker 5>this is,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think,</v>

1876
01:28:47.910 --> 01:28:49.900
<v Speaker 5>and it probably went off into,</v>
<v Speaker 5>oh,</v>

1877
01:28:49.990 --> 01:28:54.990
<v Speaker 5>there we go.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There's the one for the whole whole </v>

1878
01:28:54.990 --> 01:28:57.370
<v Speaker 5>earth.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And then they wanted to know how do you </v>

1879
01:28:57.370 --> 01:28:59.111
<v Speaker 5>do that in three d?</v>
<v Speaker 5>So I was showing them how to convert to </v>

1880
01:28:59.111 --> 01:28:59.111
<v Speaker 5>x,</v>
<v Speaker 5>y,</v>

1881
01:28:59.111 --> 01:29:02.970
<v Speaker 5>z coordinates in three d and make the </v>
<v Speaker 5>corresponding thing in three d.</v>

1882
01:29:03.240 --> 01:29:06.240
<v Speaker 5>So what's.</v>
<v Speaker 5>This maybe isn't the.</v>

1883
01:29:07.080 --> 01:29:08.730
<v Speaker 5>This is a random example from yesterday.</v>

1884
01:29:08.730 --> 01:29:11.340
<v Speaker 5>So it's not,</v>
<v Speaker 5>not a highly considered example,</v>

1885
01:29:11.341 --> 01:29:12.210
<v Speaker 5>but,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but,</v>

1886
01:29:12.211 --> 01:29:13.240
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

1887
01:29:13.260 --> 01:29:18.260
<v Speaker 5>what I think is interesting is that we </v>
<v Speaker 5>seem to have finally reached the point </v>

1888
01:29:18.260 --> 01:29:22.521
<v Speaker 5>where we've automated enough of the </v>
<v Speaker 5>actual doing of the computation that the</v>

1889
01:29:22.771 --> 01:29:27.360
<v Speaker 5>kids can be exposed mostly to thinking </v>
<v Speaker 5>about what you might want to compute.</v>

1890
01:29:27.870 --> 01:29:32.870
<v Speaker 5>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>part of our role in language design as </v>

1891
01:29:32.870 --> 01:29:35.961
<v Speaker 5>far as I'm concerned,</v>
<v Speaker 5>is to get it as much as possible to the </v>

1892
01:29:35.961 --> 01:29:35.961
<v Speaker 5>point where,</v>
<v Speaker 5>for example,</v>

1893
01:29:35.961 --> 01:29:37.080
<v Speaker 5>you can do a bunch of natural language </v>
<v Speaker 5>input,</v>

1894
01:29:37.440 --> 01:29:42.440
<v Speaker 5>you can do things which make it as easy </v>
<v Speaker 5>as possible for kids to not get mixed up</v>

1895
01:29:42.721 --> 01:29:44.460
<v Speaker 5>in the kind of what the,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1896
01:29:44.461 --> 01:29:49.461
<v Speaker 5>how the computation gets done,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but rather to just think about how you </v>

1897
01:29:49.461 --> 01:29:49.461
<v Speaker 5>formulate the computation.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So for example,</v>

1898
01:29:49.461 --> 01:29:51.750
<v Speaker 5>a typical example I've used a bunch of </v>
<v Speaker 5>times in,</v>

1899
01:29:51.850 --> 01:29:56.850
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what does it mean to write code versus </v>

1900
01:29:56.850 --> 01:29:56.850
<v Speaker 5>do other things.</v>

1901
01:29:56.850 --> 01:29:58.140
<v Speaker 5>Like a,</v>
<v Speaker 5>a typical sort of test example would be,</v>

1902
01:29:58.560 --> 01:30:00.490
<v Speaker 5>I dunno you,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you asked somebody a,</v>

1903
01:30:00.580 --> 01:30:01.920
<v Speaker 5>you're gonna,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there's practical problem.</v>

1904
01:30:01.921 --> 01:30:06.921
<v Speaker 5>We had them alpha.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You give a lat long position on the </v>

1905
01:30:06.921 --> 01:30:08.280
<v Speaker 5>earth and you say you're going to make a</v>
<v Speaker 5>map that lat long position.</v>

1906
01:30:08.281 --> 01:30:10.860
<v Speaker 5>What,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what scale of map should you make?</v>

1907
01:30:11.540 --> 01:30:13.350
<v Speaker 5>The lat,</v>
<v Speaker 5>long as in the middle of the pacific,</v>

1908
01:30:13.560 --> 01:30:17.280
<v Speaker 5>making a 10 mile radius map isn't very </v>
<v Speaker 5>interesting.</v>

1909
01:30:17.610 --> 01:30:20.610
<v Speaker 5>Fits in the middle of manhattan.</v>
<v Speaker 5>A 10 mile radius map might be quite,</v>

1910
01:30:20.670 --> 01:30:25.670
<v Speaker 5>quite a sensible thing to do.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So the question has come up with an </v>

1911
01:30:25.670 --> 01:30:26.460
<v Speaker 5>algorithm and come up with even a way of</v>
<v Speaker 5>thinking about that question.</v>

1912
01:30:26.490 --> 01:30:27.670
<v Speaker 5>What do you do?</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

1913
01:30:27.800 --> 01:30:30.360
<v Speaker 5>how should you figure that out while you</v>
<v Speaker 5>might say,</v>

1914
01:30:30.570 --> 01:30:31.020
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>oh,</v>

1915
01:30:31.021 --> 01:30:33.510
<v Speaker 5>let's look at the visual complexity of </v>
<v Speaker 5>the image.</v>

1916
01:30:33.540 --> 01:30:37.490
<v Speaker 5>Let's look at how far it is to another </v>
<v Speaker 5>city that's far.</v>

1917
01:30:37.550 --> 01:30:38.970
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there are various different things,</v>

1918
01:30:38.971 --> 01:30:43.830
<v Speaker 5>but thinking about that as a kind of </v>
<v Speaker 5>computational thinking exercise that um,</v>

1919
01:30:44.970 --> 01:30:46.590
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>is um,</v>

1920
01:30:46.980 --> 01:30:47.310
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1921
01:30:47.311 --> 01:30:52.311
<v Speaker 5>that's the kind of thing.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So in terms of what one automates and </v>

1922
01:30:52.311 --> 01:30:52.710
<v Speaker 5>whether,</v>
<v Speaker 5>whether people need to understand how it</v>

1923
01:30:52.711 --> 01:30:56.000
<v Speaker 5>works inside.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>

1924
01:30:56.490 --> 01:31:01.490
<v Speaker 5>Main point is you'll,</v>
<v Speaker 5>in the end it will not be possible to </v>

1925
01:31:01.861 --> 01:31:05.470
<v Speaker 5>know how it works inside.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So you might as well stop having that be</v>

1926
01:31:05.471 --> 01:31:06.480
<v Speaker 5>a criterion.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

1927
01:31:06.481 --> 01:31:11.481
<v Speaker 5>that is,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there are plenty of things that weren't </v>

1928
01:31:11.481 --> 01:31:11.481
<v Speaker 5>teachers,</v>
<v Speaker 5>people that are,</v>

1929
01:31:11.481 --> 01:31:11.481
<v Speaker 5>let's say,</v>
<v Speaker 5>in,</v>

1930
01:31:11.481 --> 01:31:14.460
<v Speaker 5>in lots of areas of biology,</v>
<v Speaker 5>medicine,</v>

1931
01:31:14.461 --> 01:31:16.200
<v Speaker 5>whatever else,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1932
01:31:16.260 --> 01:31:18.390
<v Speaker 5>maybe we'll know how it works inside one</v>
<v Speaker 5>day,</v>

1933
01:31:18.570 --> 01:31:20.790
<v Speaker 5>but you can still,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there's an awful lot of useful stuff you</v>

1934
01:31:20.791 --> 01:31:22.830
<v Speaker 5>can teach without knowing how it works </v>
<v Speaker 5>inside.</v>

1935
01:31:23.250 --> 01:31:26.400
<v Speaker 5>And I think also as we get to </v>
<v Speaker 5>computation to be more efficient,</v>

1936
01:31:26.401 --> 01:31:28.920
<v Speaker 5>inevitably we will be dealing with </v>
<v Speaker 5>things where you don't know how it works</v>

1937
01:31:28.921 --> 01:31:29.370
<v Speaker 5>inside.</v>

1938
01:31:29.580 --> 01:31:30.000
<v Speaker 5>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1939
01:31:30.001 --> 01:31:33.750
<v Speaker 5>we've seen this in math education </v>
<v Speaker 5>because I've happened to make tools that</v>

1940
01:31:33.751 --> 01:31:36.660
<v Speaker 5>automate a bunch of things that people </v>
<v Speaker 5>do in math education.</v>

1941
01:31:37.110 --> 01:31:39.390
<v Speaker 5>And I think,</v>
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>

1942
01:31:39.391 --> 01:31:40.740
<v Speaker 5>to tell a silly story,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

1943
01:31:40.741 --> 01:31:42.540
<v Speaker 5>my,</v>
<v Speaker 5>my older daughter,</v>

1944
01:31:42.541 --> 01:31:45.370
<v Speaker 5>who at some point in the past was doing </v>
<v Speaker 5>calculus,</v>

1945
01:31:45.540 --> 01:31:47.250
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and learning doing intervals and things.</v>

1946
01:31:47.251 --> 01:31:49.320
<v Speaker 5>And I was saying to her,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1947
01:31:49.321 --> 01:31:52.730
<v Speaker 5>I didn't think humans still did that </v>
<v Speaker 5>stuff anymore.</v>

1948
01:31:53.070 --> 01:31:55.380
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>which was a very unending comment.</v>

1949
01:31:55.381 --> 01:31:57.420
<v Speaker 5>But um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but,</v>

1950
01:31:57.450 --> 01:31:58.430
<v Speaker 5>but in any case,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean the,</v>

1951
01:31:58.500 --> 01:31:58.860
<v Speaker 5>the,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1952
01:31:58.910 --> 01:32:03.910
<v Speaker 5>the,</v>
<v Speaker 5>a question of whether do humans need to </v>

1953
01:32:03.910 --> 01:32:06.721
<v Speaker 5>know how to do that stuff or not.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So I haven't done an integral by hand </v>

1954
01:32:06.721 --> 01:32:10.130
<v Speaker 5>and probably 35 years that's true.</v>
<v Speaker 5>More or less true that.</v>

1955
01:32:10.570 --> 01:32:13.300
<v Speaker 5>But when I was using computers to do </v>
<v Speaker 5>them,</v>

1956
01:32:13.990 --> 01:32:17.790
<v Speaker 5>the I was for awhile in Hawaii,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I used to do physics and so on.</v>

1957
01:32:17.790 --> 01:32:20.290
<v Speaker 5>I use computers to the stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I was a really,</v>

1958
01:32:20.291 --> 01:32:24.430
<v Speaker 5>really good integrator except that it </v>
<v Speaker 5>wasn't really me.</v>

1959
01:32:24.431 --> 01:32:27.040
<v Speaker 5>It was me plus the computer.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So how did that come to be?</v>

1960
01:32:27.041 --> 01:32:32.041
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the answer was that because I was doing </v>

1961
01:32:32.041 --> 01:32:34.381
<v Speaker 5>things by computer,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I was able to try zillions of examples </v>

1962
01:32:34.381 --> 01:32:38.040
<v Speaker 5>and I got a much better intuition that </v>
<v Speaker 5>most people got for how these things </v>

1963
01:32:38.040 --> 01:32:38.320
<v Speaker 5>would work,</v>
<v Speaker 5>roughly how,</v>

1964
01:32:38.321 --> 01:32:40.990
<v Speaker 5>what you did to make the thing go and so</v>
<v Speaker 5>on.</v>

1965
01:32:41.260 --> 01:32:46.260
<v Speaker 5>Whereas people who are like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm just working this one thing out by </v>

1966
01:32:46.260 --> 01:32:46.260
<v Speaker 5>hand.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You get a different,</v>

1967
01:32:46.260 --> 01:32:46.260
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you,</v>

1968
01:32:46.260 --> 01:32:47.710
<v Speaker 5>you don't get that intuition.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So I think,</v>

1969
01:32:47.910 --> 01:32:48.790
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>two points.</v>

1970
01:32:48.940 --> 01:32:53.940
<v Speaker 5>First of all this,</v>
<v Speaker 5>how do you think about things </v>

1971
01:32:53.940 --> 01:32:57.271
<v Speaker 5>computationally?</v>
<v Speaker 5>How do you formulate the question </v>

1972
01:32:57.271 --> 01:32:59.431
<v Speaker 5>computationally that's really important </v>
<v Speaker 5>and something that we are now in a </v>

1973
01:32:59.431 --> 01:33:02.170
<v Speaker 5>position I think to actually teach and </v>
<v Speaker 5>it is not really something you teach by,</v>

1974
01:33:02.580 --> 01:33:03.640
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>teaching,</v>

1975
01:33:03.810 --> 01:33:05.140
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>traditional quotes,</v>

1976
01:33:05.141 --> 01:33:07.210
<v Speaker 5>coding,</v>
<v Speaker 5>because a lot of that is.</v>

1977
01:33:07.210 --> 01:33:08.440
<v Speaker 5>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we're going to make a loop.</v>

1978
01:33:08.441 --> 01:33:12.040
<v Speaker 5>We're going to define variables.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I just as I think I probably have a copy</v>

1979
01:33:12.041 --> 01:33:12.460
<v Speaker 5>here.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

1980
01:33:12.790 --> 01:33:17.790
<v Speaker 5>the,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I wrote this book for this book kind of </v>

1981
01:33:17.790 --> 01:33:19.540
<v Speaker 5>for kids about oral language except it </v>
<v Speaker 5>seems to be useful to adults as well,</v>

1982
01:33:19.541 --> 01:33:21.940
<v Speaker 5>but I wrote it for kids.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So it's,</v>

1983
01:33:21.941 --> 01:33:22.750
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm,</v>

1984
01:33:22.870 --> 01:33:26.090
<v Speaker 5>one of the amusing things in this book </v>
<v Speaker 5>is it doesn't talk it.</v>

1985
01:33:26.140 --> 01:33:30.010
<v Speaker 5>Talk about assigning values to variables</v>
<v Speaker 5>until chapter 38.</v>

1986
01:33:30.790 --> 01:33:33.370
<v Speaker 5>So in other words,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that will be a thing that you would find</v>

1987
01:33:33.371 --> 01:33:35.350
<v Speaker 5>in chapter one of most,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1988
01:33:35.830 --> 01:33:38.590
<v Speaker 5>low level programming,</v>
<v Speaker 5>coding type type things.</v>

1989
01:33:38.591 --> 01:33:40.870
<v Speaker 5>It turns out it's not that relevant to </v>
<v Speaker 5>know how to do that.</v>

1990
01:33:41.080 --> 01:33:45.340
<v Speaker 5>it's also kind of confusing and I'm uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>not necessarily.</v>

1991
01:33:45.341 --> 01:33:47.090
<v Speaker 5>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 5>no,</v>

1992
01:33:47.140 --> 01:33:52.140
<v Speaker 5>in terms of the,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you asked where will we get in trouble </v>

1993
01:33:52.140 --> 01:33:52.140
<v Speaker 5>when people don't know how this stuff </v>
<v Speaker 5>works inside.</v>

1994
01:33:52.140 --> 01:33:54.250
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's,</v>

1995
01:33:54.310 --> 01:33:55.310
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1996
01:33:55.330 --> 01:33:58.570
<v Speaker 5>I think one just has to get used to that</v>
<v Speaker 5>because it's like,</v>

1997
01:33:58.630 --> 01:33:59.290
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you might say,</v>

1998
01:33:59.291 --> 01:34:02.770
<v Speaker 5>well we live in the world and it's full </v>
<v Speaker 5>of natural processes where we don't know</v>

1999
01:34:02.771 --> 01:34:06.940
<v Speaker 5>how they work inside,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but somehow we managed to survive and we</v>

2000
01:34:06.941 --> 01:34:11.941
<v Speaker 5>go to a lot of effort to do natural </v>
<v Speaker 5>science to try and figure out how stuff </v>

2001
01:34:11.941 --> 01:34:13.450
<v Speaker 5>works inside.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But it turns out we can still use plenty</v>

2002
01:34:13.451 --> 01:34:15.460
<v Speaker 5>of things even when we don't know how </v>
<v Speaker 5>they work inside.</v>

2003
01:34:15.750 --> 01:34:17.520
<v Speaker 5>We don't need to know.</v>
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

2004
01:34:17.590 --> 01:34:19.000
<v Speaker 5>and I think the,</v>
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

2005
01:34:19.070 --> 01:34:21.430
<v Speaker 5>I mean I think the main point is </v>
<v Speaker 5>computational error,</v>

2006
01:34:21.431 --> 01:34:26.431
<v Speaker 5>reducibility guarantees that we will be </v>
<v Speaker 5>using things where we don't know and </v>

2007
01:34:26.431 --> 01:34:28.660
<v Speaker 5>can't know how they work inside.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And you know,</v>

2008
01:34:28.661 --> 01:34:29.890
<v Speaker 5>I think the,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the,</v>

2009
01:34:29.891 --> 01:34:34.260
<v Speaker 5>perhaps the thing that is a little bit,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2010
01:34:34.360 --> 01:34:37.710
<v Speaker 5>to me a little bit unfortunate as a,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2011
01:34:38.020 --> 01:34:40.330
<v Speaker 5>as a typical human type thing.</v>

2012
01:34:40.660 --> 01:34:43.330
<v Speaker 5>The fact that I can readily see that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2013
01:34:43.390 --> 01:34:48.390
<v Speaker 5>the ai stuff we build is sort of </v>
<v Speaker 5>effectively creating languages and </v>

2014
01:34:48.611 --> 01:34:53.200
<v Speaker 5>things that are completely outside of </v>
<v Speaker 5>the domain to understand and where by by</v>

2015
01:34:53.201 --> 01:34:54.700
<v Speaker 5>that I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2016
01:34:55.030 --> 01:34:56.920
<v Speaker 5>our human language,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but that's 50,000</v>

2017
01:34:56.930 --> 01:35:01.930
<v Speaker 5>words or whatever has been developed </v>
<v Speaker 5>over the last however many tens of </v>

2018
01:35:01.930 --> 01:35:05.261
<v Speaker 5>thousands of years.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And as a society we've developed this </v>

2019
01:35:05.261 --> 01:35:05.630
<v Speaker 5>way of communicating and explaining </v>
<v Speaker 5>things.</v>

2020
01:35:05.970 --> 01:35:10.970
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the ais are reproducing that process </v>

2021
01:35:10.970 --> 01:35:12.250
<v Speaker 5>very quickly,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but they're coming up with a,</v>

2022
01:35:12.251 --> 01:35:13.820
<v Speaker 5>an,</v>
<v Speaker 5>a historical,</v>

2023
01:35:14.100 --> 01:35:14.960
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>something,</v>

2024
01:35:15.050 --> 01:35:20.050
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that way of describing the world that </v>

2025
01:35:20.050 --> 01:35:20.050
<v Speaker 5>doesn't happen to relate at all to our </v>
<v Speaker 5>historical way of doing it.</v>

2026
01:35:20.120 --> 01:35:21.620
<v Speaker 5>And that's um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2027
01:35:21.740 --> 01:35:24.290
<v Speaker 5>it's a little bit disquieting to me as a</v>
<v Speaker 5>human that,</v>

2028
01:35:24.291 --> 01:35:24.740
<v Speaker 5>that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2029
01:35:24.790 --> 01:35:26.780
<v Speaker 5>are things going on inside where I know </v>
<v Speaker 5>it is.</v>

2030
01:35:26.940 --> 01:35:31.940
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>in principle I could learn that </v>

2031
01:35:31.940 --> 01:35:33.791
<v Speaker 5>language,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but it's not the historical one that </v>

2032
01:35:33.791 --> 01:35:34.350
<v Speaker 5>we've all learned.</v>

2033
01:35:34.760 --> 01:35:39.760
<v Speaker 5>And it really wouldn't make a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 5>sense to do that because you learn it </v>

2034
01:35:39.760 --> 01:35:42.131
<v Speaker 5>for one ai and then another one gets </v>
<v Speaker 5>trained and it's going to use something </v>

2035
01:35:42.131 --> 01:35:42.590
<v Speaker 5>different.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So it's some.</v>

2036
01:35:42.830 --> 01:35:44.810
<v Speaker 5>But my main,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I guess my main point for,</v>

2037
01:35:45.050 --> 01:35:50.050
<v Speaker 5>for education.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So another point about education I just </v>

2038
01:35:50.050 --> 01:35:50.050
<v Speaker 5>make,</v>
<v Speaker 5>which is something I haven't figured out</v>

2039
01:35:50.050 --> 01:35:50.050
<v Speaker 5>but,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but um,</v>

2040
01:35:50.050 --> 01:35:52.610
<v Speaker 5>just is um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2041
01:35:52.850 --> 01:35:57.850
<v Speaker 5>when do we get to make a good model for </v>
<v Speaker 5>the human learner using machine </v>

2042
01:35:57.850 --> 01:35:58.850
<v Speaker 5>learning?</v>
<v Speaker 5>So in other words,</v>

2043
01:35:59.100 --> 01:36:00.560
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>part of what we're trying to do,</v>

2044
01:36:00.561 --> 01:36:02.690
<v Speaker 5>like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like I've got that automated proof,</v>

2045
01:36:02.990 --> 01:36:07.990
<v Speaker 5>I would really like to manage to figure </v>
<v Speaker 5>out a way what is the best way to </v>

2046
01:36:07.990 --> 01:36:09.230
<v Speaker 5>present that proof so human can </v>
<v Speaker 5>understand it.</v>

2047
01:36:09.740 --> 01:36:14.740
<v Speaker 5>And basically for that we have to have a</v>
<v Speaker 5>bunch of heuristics about how humans </v>

2048
01:36:14.740 --> 01:36:16.340
<v Speaker 5>understand things.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So as an example,</v>

2049
01:36:16.460 --> 01:36:21.460
<v Speaker 5>if we're doing,</v>
<v Speaker 5>let's say a lot of visualization stuff </v>

2050
01:36:21.460 --> 01:36:21.460
<v Speaker 5>and wolfram language,</v>
<v Speaker 5>okay,</v>

2051
01:36:21.460 --> 01:36:23.390
<v Speaker 5>we have tried to automate to automate it</v>
<v Speaker 5>aesthetics.</v>

2052
01:36:23.810 --> 01:36:27.080
<v Speaker 5>So what we're doing is we're laying out </v>
<v Speaker 5>a graph.</v>

2053
01:36:27.500 --> 01:36:31.190
<v Speaker 5>What way of laying out that graph is </v>
<v Speaker 5>most likely for humans to understand it.</v>

2054
01:36:31.610 --> 01:36:34.520
<v Speaker 5>And we've done that by building a bunch </v>
<v Speaker 5>of heuristics and so on,</v>

2055
01:36:34.760 --> 01:36:36.440
<v Speaker 5>but that's an example of,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2056
01:36:36.441 --> 01:36:41.441
<v Speaker 5>if we could do that for learning and we </v>
<v Speaker 5>say what's the optimal path given that </v>

2057
01:36:41.441 --> 01:36:42.320
<v Speaker 5>the person is trying to understand this </v>
<v Speaker 5>proof,</v>

2058
01:36:42.321 --> 01:36:47.321
<v Speaker 5>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what's the optimal path to lead them </v>

2059
01:36:47.321 --> 01:36:49.931
<v Speaker 5>through understanding that proof.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I suspect we will learn a lot more and </v>

2060
01:36:49.931 --> 01:36:51.830
<v Speaker 5>probably fairly small number of years </v>
<v Speaker 5>about that.</v>

2061
01:36:52.010 --> 01:36:53.410
<v Speaker 5>And it will be the case that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2062
01:36:53.630 --> 01:36:55.850
<v Speaker 5>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 5>if you've got,</v>

2063
01:36:56.270 --> 01:36:58.730
<v Speaker 5>oh I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you can do simple things like you know,</v>

2064
01:36:58.731 --> 01:37:01.250
<v Speaker 5>you go to wikipedia and you look at what</v>
<v Speaker 5>the path of,</v>

2065
01:37:01.410 --> 01:37:02.030
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>how do you,</v>

2066
01:37:02.031 --> 01:37:04.460
<v Speaker 5>if you want to learn this concept,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what are the concepts you have to learn?</v>

2067
01:37:04.790 --> 01:37:09.790
<v Speaker 5>We have much more detailed symbolic </v>
<v Speaker 5>information about what is actually </v>

2068
01:37:09.790 --> 01:37:11.480
<v Speaker 5>necessary to know in order to understand</v>
<v Speaker 5>this.</v>

2069
01:37:11.481 --> 01:37:12.650
<v Speaker 5>And so on.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It is,</v>

2070
01:37:12.651 --> 01:37:17.651
<v Speaker 5>I think,</v>
<v Speaker 5>reasonably likely that we will be able </v>

2071
01:37:17.651 --> 01:37:17.651
<v Speaker 5>to.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean if I look at.</v>

2072
01:37:17.651 --> 01:37:20.060
<v Speaker 5>I was interested recently in the history</v>
<v Speaker 5>of math education.</v>

2073
01:37:20.090 --> 01:37:24.290
<v Speaker 5>so I wanted to look at the complete sort</v>
<v Speaker 5>of path of math textbooks.</v>

2074
01:37:24.850 --> 01:37:26.060
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>for the past,</v>

2075
01:37:26.120 --> 01:37:27.590
<v Speaker 5>well basically the,</v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

2076
01:37:27.620 --> 01:37:29.870
<v Speaker 5>like 1200,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2077
01:37:30.050 --> 01:37:32.840
<v Speaker 5>even actually produced this one of the </v>
<v Speaker 5>early math textbooks.</v>

2078
01:37:33.080 --> 01:37:36.440
<v Speaker 5>So there'd been these different ways of </v>
<v Speaker 5>teaching math and you know,</v>

2079
01:37:36.441 --> 01:37:41.441
<v Speaker 5>I think we've,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we've gradually evolved a fairly </v>

2080
01:37:41.441 --> 01:37:41.720
<v Speaker 5>optimized way for the typical person </v>
<v Speaker 5>though.</v>

2081
01:37:41.721 --> 01:37:46.721
<v Speaker 5>It's probably the variation of the </v>
<v Speaker 5>population is not well understood for </v>

2082
01:37:46.721 --> 01:37:47.750
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>how to explain certain concepts.</v>

2083
01:37:47.960 --> 01:37:52.960
<v Speaker 5>And we've gone through some pretty weird</v>
<v Speaker 5>ways of doing it from the 16 hundreds </v>

2084
01:37:52.960 --> 01:37:55.590
<v Speaker 5>and so on were which have gone out of </v>
<v Speaker 5>style and possibly,</v>

2085
01:37:55.640 --> 01:37:58.020
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>who knows what that's because of.</v>

2086
01:37:58.350 --> 01:37:59.340
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but anyway,</v>

2087
01:37:59.341 --> 01:37:59.880
<v Speaker 5>so,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so,</v>

2088
01:38:00.000 --> 01:38:05.000
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we've kind of learned this path of </v>

2089
01:38:05.000 --> 01:38:06.801
<v Speaker 5>what's the optimal way to explain adding</v>
<v Speaker 5>fractions or something for humans for </v>

2090
01:38:06.801 --> 01:38:08.940
<v Speaker 5>the typical human.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But I think we'll learn a lot more about</v>

2091
01:38:08.941 --> 01:38:09.750
<v Speaker 5>how,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2092
01:38:09.751 --> 01:38:14.751
<v Speaker 5>by,</v>
<v Speaker 5>by essentially making a model for the </v>

2093
01:38:14.751 --> 01:38:14.751
<v Speaker 5>human.</v>
<v Speaker 5>A machine model for the human will learn</v>

2094
01:38:14.751 --> 01:38:15.780
<v Speaker 5>more about how to,</v>
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

2095
01:38:16.170 --> 01:38:17.280
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>how to optimize,</v>

2096
01:38:17.281 --> 01:38:20.250
<v Speaker 5>how to explain stuff to humans,</v>
<v Speaker 5>a coming attraction.</v>

2097
01:38:20.800 --> 01:38:21.010
<v Speaker 5>But</v>

2098
01:38:22.230 --> 01:38:24.570
<v Speaker 9>by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 9>do you think we're close to that at all?</v>

2099
01:38:24.600 --> 01:38:25.290
<v Speaker 9>Because you,</v>
<v Speaker 9>you,</v>

2100
01:38:25.291 --> 01:38:28.980
<v Speaker 9>you said that there's a,</v>
<v Speaker 9>something in wolfram alpha that,</v>

2101
01:38:29.040 --> 01:38:31.250
<v Speaker 9>that presents the human a nice,</v>
<v Speaker 9>our.</v>

2102
01:38:31.251 --> 01:38:32.910
<v Speaker 9>Where are we,</v>
<v Speaker 9>how far?</v>

2103
01:38:32.940 --> 01:38:34.500
<v Speaker 9>He said coming attraction,</v>
<v Speaker 9>tenure.</v>

2104
01:38:34.610 --> 01:38:39.610
<v Speaker 5>All right.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So I mean in that explaining stuff to </v>

2105
01:38:39.610 --> 01:38:44.501
<v Speaker 5>humans thing is a lot of human work </v>
<v Speaker 5>right now being able to automate </v>

2106
01:38:45.020 --> 01:38:47.030
<v Speaker 5>explaining stuff to humans.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>

2107
01:38:47.031 --> 01:38:51.230
<v Speaker 5>So some of these things but see,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

2108
01:38:51.231 --> 01:38:56.231
<v Speaker 5>so an interesting question actually just</v>
<v Speaker 5>today I was working on something that's </v>

2109
01:38:56.231 --> 01:38:56.930
<v Speaker 5>related to this.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

2110
01:38:56.931 --> 01:38:57.300
<v Speaker 5>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's,</v>

2111
01:38:57.360 --> 01:39:00.140
<v Speaker 5>it's being able to,</v>
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

2112
01:39:00.590 --> 01:39:02.480
<v Speaker 5>the question is given a whole bunch of,</v>
<v Speaker 5>can we,</v>

2113
01:39:02.481 --> 01:39:07.481
<v Speaker 5>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 5>train a machine learning system from </v>

2114
01:39:07.481 --> 01:39:10.901
<v Speaker 5>explanations that it can see roughly can</v>
<v Speaker 5>we train it to give explanations that </v>

2115
01:39:10.901 --> 01:39:12.770
<v Speaker 5>are likely to be understandable?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Maybe.</v>

2116
01:39:13.400 --> 01:39:15.170
<v Speaker 5>I think the.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>

2117
01:39:15.171 --> 01:39:17.210
<v Speaker 5>So an example that I'd like to do.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>

2118
01:39:17.240 --> 01:39:22.240
<v Speaker 5>I'd like to do a debugging assistant </v>
<v Speaker 5>where the typical thing is program runs </v>

2119
01:39:22.240 --> 01:39:24.620
<v Speaker 5>program gives wrong answer.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Human says,</v>

2120
01:39:24.680 --> 01:39:26.960
<v Speaker 5>why did you get the wrong way?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Did it give the wrong answer?</v>

2121
01:39:27.260 --> 01:39:32.260
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the first piece of information to the </v>

2122
01:39:32.260 --> 01:39:32.260
<v Speaker 5>computer is that was the human thought.</v>

2123
01:39:32.260 --> 01:39:36.010
<v Speaker 5>That was the wrong answer because the </v>
<v Speaker 5>computer just did what it was told and </v>

2124
01:39:36.010 --> 01:39:36.530
<v Speaker 5>it didn't know that was supposed to be </v>
<v Speaker 5>the wrong answer.</v>

2125
01:39:36.531 --> 01:39:38.030
<v Speaker 5>So then the question is,</v>
<v Speaker 5>can you,</v>

2126
01:39:38.031 --> 01:39:39.010
<v Speaker 5>in fact,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2127
01:39:39.100 --> 01:39:44.100
<v Speaker 5>in that domain,</v>
<v Speaker 5>can you actually have a reasonable </v>

2128
01:39:44.100 --> 01:39:47.951
<v Speaker 5>conversation in which the human is </v>
<v Speaker 5>explaining the computer what they </v>

2129
01:39:47.951 --> 01:39:51.371
<v Speaker 5>thought it was supposed to do.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The computer is explaining what </v>

2130
01:39:51.371 --> 01:39:51.371
<v Speaker 5>happened,</v>
<v Speaker 5>why did it happen?</v>

2131
01:39:51.371 --> 01:39:52.940
<v Speaker 5>And so on.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Same thing for math tutoring.</v>

2132
01:39:53.390 --> 01:39:53.890
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2133
01:39:53.900 --> 01:39:55.550
<v Speaker 5>we have a lot of,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2134
01:39:55.551 --> 01:39:56.810
<v Speaker 5>we've got a lot of stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2135
01:39:56.811 --> 01:40:01.811
<v Speaker 5>we're,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we're sort of very widely used for </v>

2136
01:40:01.811 --> 01:40:01.910
<v Speaker 5>people who want to understand the steps </v>
<v Speaker 5>in math,</v>

2137
01:40:02.200 --> 01:40:07.200
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>can we make a thing where people tell </v>

2138
01:40:07.200 --> 01:40:07.200
<v Speaker 5>us?</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think it's this.</v>

2139
01:40:07.200 --> 01:40:07.200
<v Speaker 5>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'll tell you one,</v>

2140
01:40:07.200 --> 01:40:11.540
<v Speaker 5>one little factoid which I did work out.</v>
<v Speaker 5>so if you do multi arithmetic,</v>

2141
01:40:11.570 --> 01:40:12.590
<v Speaker 5>multi digital edition.</v>

2142
01:40:12.890 --> 01:40:14.090
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>

2143
01:40:14.091 --> 01:40:17.780
<v Speaker 5>So the,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the basis of this is kind of silly,</v>

2144
01:40:17.810 --> 01:40:18.550
<v Speaker 5>silly thing,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but,</v>

2145
01:40:18.551 --> 01:40:23.551
<v Speaker 5>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>if you get the right answer for an </v>

2146
01:40:23.551 --> 01:40:23.551
<v Speaker 5>audition some.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>

2147
01:40:23.551 --> 01:40:25.760
<v Speaker 5>You don't get very much information.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The student gives the wrong answer.</v>

2148
01:40:26.060 --> 01:40:28.190
<v Speaker 5>The question is can you tell them where </v>
<v Speaker 5>they went wrong?</v>

2149
01:40:28.900 --> 01:40:33.900
<v Speaker 5>So I'd say you have afforded in addition</v>
<v Speaker 5>some and the student gives the wrong </v>

2150
01:40:33.900 --> 01:40:37.451
<v Speaker 5>answer.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Can you back trace and figure out what </v>

2151
01:40:37.451 --> 01:40:37.910
<v Speaker 5>they likely did wrong?</v>
<v Speaker 5>And the answer is you can you,</v>

2152
01:40:38.040 --> 01:40:41.120
<v Speaker 5>you just make this graph of all the </v>
<v Speaker 5>different things that can happen,</v>

2153
01:40:41.320 --> 01:40:46.320
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>when did they know there are certain </v>

2154
01:40:46.320 --> 01:40:48.611
<v Speaker 5>things that are more common,</v>
<v Speaker 5>transposing numbers and things or you </v>

2155
01:40:48.611 --> 01:40:48.710
<v Speaker 5>know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>having a one on a mixed up,</v>

2156
01:40:48.740 --> 01:40:53.080
<v Speaker 5>those kinds of things you can with very </v>
<v Speaker 5>high probability given afforded addition</v>

2157
01:40:53.110 --> 01:40:58.110
<v Speaker 5>some with the wrong answer.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You can Say this is the mistake you </v>

2158
01:40:58.110 --> 01:41:01.381
<v Speaker 5>made,</v>
<v Speaker 5>which is sort of interesting and that's </v>

2159
01:41:01.381 --> 01:41:04.600
<v Speaker 5>being done in a fairly symbolic way.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Whether one can do that in a,</v>

2160
01:41:04.780 --> 01:41:09.780
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>more machine learning kind of way for </v>

2161
01:41:09.780 --> 01:41:09.780
<v Speaker 5>more complicated directions.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm not sure,</v>

2162
01:41:09.780 --> 01:41:11.350
<v Speaker 5>but that's a,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's one that works.</v>

2163
01:41:11.860 --> 01:41:14.170
<v Speaker 5>The.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

2164
01:41:14.490 --> 01:41:16.090
<v Speaker 5>I just had a followup question.</v>

2165
01:41:16.950 --> 01:41:18.310
<v Speaker 7>So do you think,</v>
<v Speaker 7>uh,</v>

2166
01:41:18.330 --> 01:41:20.000
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 7>like in the future it is,</v>

2167
01:41:20.080 --> 01:41:25.080
<v Speaker 7>is it wasn't moved to simulate virtual </v>
<v Speaker 7>environment which can actually </v>

2168
01:41:25.111 --> 01:41:28.750
<v Speaker 7>understand how the human mind works and </v>
<v Speaker 7>then build a,</v>

2169
01:41:28.770 --> 01:41:33.770
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 7>like finite state machines inside of </v>

2170
01:41:33.770 --> 01:41:33.770
<v Speaker 7>this watch and environment,</v>
<v Speaker 7>uh,</v>

2171
01:41:33.770 --> 01:41:37.941
<v Speaker 7>to,</v>
<v Speaker 7>to provide a better learning experience </v>

2172
01:41:37.941 --> 01:41:38.340
<v Speaker 7>and a more personalized learning </v>
<v Speaker 7>experience.</v>

2173
01:41:39.180 --> 01:41:39.510
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

2174
01:41:39.511 --> 01:41:40.860
<v Speaker 5>so the question is if,</v>
<v Speaker 5>if,</v>

2175
01:41:41.130 --> 01:41:43.720
<v Speaker 5>if you're going to,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2176
01:41:43.770 --> 01:41:48.770
<v Speaker 5>can you optimize if you're playing a </v>
<v Speaker 5>video game or something and that video </v>

2177
01:41:48.770 --> 01:41:51.741
<v Speaker 5>game is supposed to be educational,</v>
<v Speaker 5>can you optimize the experience based on</v>

2178
01:41:52.320 --> 01:41:54.450
<v Speaker 5>a model of you so to speak?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

2179
01:41:54.451 --> 01:41:56.820
<v Speaker 5>I'm sure the answer is yes.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And I'm sure the,</v>

2180
01:41:56.821 --> 01:42:01.821
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the question of how complicated the </v>

2181
01:42:01.821 --> 01:42:01.821
<v Speaker 5>model of you will be as an interesting </v>
<v Speaker 5>question.</v>

2182
01:42:01.821 --> 01:42:03.030
<v Speaker 5>They don't know the answer to.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean I've,</v>

2183
01:42:03.210 --> 01:42:04.740
<v Speaker 5>I've kind of wondered a similar </v>
<v Speaker 5>question.</v>

2184
01:42:04.741 --> 01:42:09.741
<v Speaker 5>So I,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm a kind of personal analytics </v>

2185
01:42:09.741 --> 01:42:10.310
<v Speaker 5>enthusiastic.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I collect tons of data about myself.</v>

2186
01:42:10.820 --> 01:42:15.820
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I do it mostly because it's been super </v>

2187
01:42:15.820 --> 01:42:15.820
<v Speaker 5>easy to do and I've done it for like 30 </v>
<v Speaker 5>years and I have,</v>

2188
01:42:15.820 --> 01:42:20.661
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>every key stroke I've typed on a </v>

2189
01:42:20.661 --> 01:42:20.661
<v Speaker 5>computer,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like every keystroke I've typed here and</v>

2190
01:42:20.661 --> 01:42:24.800
<v Speaker 5>the screen of my computer every,</v>
<v Speaker 5>every 30 seconds or so of maybe 15 </v>

2191
01:42:24.800 --> 01:42:25.320
<v Speaker 5>seconds,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm not sure it does.</v>

2192
01:42:25.320 --> 01:42:28.140
<v Speaker 5>A screenshot is a super boring movie to </v>
<v Speaker 5>watch.</v>

2193
01:42:28.141 --> 01:42:33.141
<v Speaker 5>But anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I've been collecting all this stuff and </v>

2194
01:42:33.141 --> 01:42:35.721
<v Speaker 5>so a question that I've asked is,</v>
<v Speaker 5>is there enough data that a bot of me </v>

2195
01:42:35.721 --> 01:42:37.620
<v Speaker 5>could be made?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Other words,</v>

2196
01:42:37.930 --> 01:42:40.140
<v Speaker 5>do I have enough data about,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2197
01:42:40.141 --> 01:42:42.780
<v Speaker 5>I've got,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I've written a million emails,</v>

2198
01:42:43.490 --> 01:42:46.200
<v Speaker 5>I have all of those.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I've received 3 million emails.</v>

2199
01:42:46.450 --> 01:42:50.490
<v Speaker 5>I'm over that period of time.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I've got endless,</v>

2200
01:42:50.540 --> 01:42:51.930
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>things I've typed,</v>

2201
01:42:52.000 --> 01:42:52.550
<v Speaker 5>et cetera,</v>
<v Speaker 5>et cetera,</v>

2202
01:42:52.551 --> 01:42:53.760
<v Speaker 5>et cetera.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

2203
01:42:53.761 --> 01:42:57.900
<v Speaker 5>is there enough data to reconstruct you </v>
<v Speaker 5>know me?</v>

2204
01:42:57.960 --> 01:43:01.350
<v Speaker 5>Basically,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think the answer is probably yes.</v>

2205
01:43:01.890 --> 01:43:04.020
<v Speaker 5>Not sure,</v>
<v Speaker 5>But I think the answer's probably yes.</v>

2206
01:43:04.290 --> 01:43:08.160
<v Speaker 5>And so the question is in an environment</v>
<v Speaker 5>where you're interacting with some video</v>

2207
01:43:08.161 --> 01:43:09.270
<v Speaker 5>game,</v>
<v Speaker 5>trying to learn something,</v>

2208
01:43:09.271 --> 01:43:10.470
<v Speaker 5>whatever else,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2209
01:43:10.471 --> 01:43:15.471
<v Speaker 5>how long is it going to be before it can</v>
<v Speaker 5>learn enough about you to change that </v>

2210
01:43:15.471 --> 01:43:17.640
<v Speaker 5>environment in a way that's useful for </v>
<v Speaker 5>explaining the next thing to you?</v>

2211
01:43:18.120 --> 01:43:21.240
<v Speaker 5>I would guess I would guess that have </v>
<v Speaker 5>done that.</v>

2212
01:43:21.241 --> 01:43:24.240
<v Speaker 5>This is comparatively easy.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I might be wrong,</v>

2213
01:43:24.241 --> 01:43:25.020
<v Speaker 5>but,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but um,</v>

2214
01:43:25.340 --> 01:43:26.400
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and that the,</v>

2215
01:43:26.470 --> 01:43:27.630
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

2216
01:43:27.631 --> 01:43:28.200
<v Speaker 5>I think,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2217
01:43:28.220 --> 01:43:30.960
<v Speaker 5>it's an interesting thing because no </v>
<v Speaker 5>one's dealing with,</v>

2218
01:43:31.060 --> 01:43:33.030
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there's a space of human personalities.</v>

2219
01:43:33.031 --> 01:43:35.100
<v Speaker 5>There's a space of human learning </v>
<v Speaker 5>styles,</v>

2220
01:43:35.430 --> 01:43:40.430
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm sort of always interested in the </v>

2221
01:43:40.430 --> 01:43:40.430
<v Speaker 5>space of all possible x,</v>
<v Speaker 5>y,</v>

2222
01:43:40.430 --> 01:43:40.680
<v Speaker 5>z,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and there's,</v>

2223
01:43:40.800 --> 01:43:41.880
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there's that question of,</v>

2224
01:43:41.881 --> 01:43:43.650
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>how do you parameterize the space of all</v>

2225
01:43:43.651 --> 01:43:48.360
<v Speaker 5>possible human learning styles and is </v>
<v Speaker 5>there a way that we will learn,</v>

2226
01:43:48.361 --> 01:43:49.920
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like,</v>

2227
01:43:50.100 --> 01:43:55.100
<v Speaker 5>can we do that symbolically and say </v>
<v Speaker 5>these are 10 learning styles or is it </v>

2228
01:43:55.100 --> 01:43:59.291
<v Speaker 5>something.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think that's the case Where it's </v>

2229
01:43:59.291 --> 01:43:59.291
<v Speaker 5>better to use,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2230
01:43:59.291 --> 01:44:03.250
<v Speaker 5>sort of soft machine learning type </v>
<v Speaker 5>methods to kind of feel out that space.</v>

2231
01:44:08.410 --> 01:44:09.920
<v Speaker 5>Maybe very last question.</v>

2232
01:44:10.660 --> 01:44:14.560
<v Speaker 7>I was just intuitively thinking when you</v>
<v Speaker 7>spoke about an ocean,</v>

2233
01:44:14.561 --> 01:44:17.800
<v Speaker 7>I thought of isaac newton when he said,</v>
<v Speaker 7>uh,</v>

2234
01:44:18.390 --> 01:44:20.080
<v Speaker 7>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

2235
01:44:20.081 --> 01:44:21.850
<v Speaker 7>the famous quote,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I might not,</v>

2236
01:44:22.240 --> 01:44:25.000
<v Speaker 7>and I thought instead of newton on the </v>
<v Speaker 7>beach,</v>

2237
01:44:25.030 --> 01:44:27.880
<v Speaker 7>what a friends list.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Where there a,</v>

2238
01:44:27.881 --> 01:44:30.680
<v Speaker 7>what question would he ask?</v>
<v Speaker 7>What would he say?</v>

2239
01:44:30.681 --> 01:44:35.681
<v Speaker 7>And I'm trying to understand your,</v>
<v Speaker 7>the alien ocean and humans through maybe</v>

2240
01:44:39.671 --> 01:44:41.080
<v Speaker 7>franz liszt and music.</v>

2241
01:44:42.410 --> 01:44:44.180
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so I mean,</v>

2242
01:44:44.200 --> 01:44:45.700
<v Speaker 5>the,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the quote from newton is,</v>

2243
01:44:45.750 --> 01:44:46.360
<v Speaker 5>is,</v>
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

2244
01:44:46.670 --> 01:44:49.750
<v Speaker 5>a sort of an interesting quote.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think it goes something like this if,</v>

2245
01:44:49.870 --> 01:44:52.340
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

2246
01:44:53.240 --> 01:44:56.950
<v Speaker 5>people are talking about how wonderful </v>
<v Speaker 5>calculus and all that kind of thing are.</v>

2247
01:44:56.980 --> 01:44:59.100
<v Speaker 5>And newton says,</v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

2248
01:44:59.210 --> 01:45:00.350
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>to others,</v>

2249
01:45:00.351 --> 01:45:01.880
<v Speaker 5>I may seem like I've done a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 5>stuff,</v>

2250
01:45:01.881 --> 01:45:06.340
<v Speaker 5>but to me I seem like a child who,</v>
<v Speaker 5>who picked up a particularly elegance,</v>

2251
01:45:06.370 --> 01:45:07.840
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>seashell on the,</v>

2252
01:45:07.841 --> 01:45:11.090
<v Speaker 5>on the beach.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And I've been studying this seashell for</v>

2253
01:45:11.091 --> 01:45:16.091
<v Speaker 5>awhile.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Even though there's this ocean of truth </v>

2254
01:45:16.091 --> 01:45:16.091
<v Speaker 5>out there waiting to be discovered,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's roughly the quote.</v>

2255
01:45:16.091 --> 01:45:21.030
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I find that quote interesting for the </v>

2256
01:45:21.030 --> 01:45:21.030
<v Speaker 5>following reason.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The,</v>

2257
01:45:21.030 --> 01:45:22.920
<v Speaker 5>what newton did was,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2258
01:45:23.150 --> 01:45:28.150
<v Speaker 5>calculus and things like it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>If yoU look at the computational </v>

2259
01:45:28.150 --> 01:45:30.140
<v Speaker 5>universe of all possible programs,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there is a small corner.</v>

2260
01:45:30.141 --> 01:45:32.510
<v Speaker 5>Newton was exactly right and what he </v>
<v Speaker 5>said that his,</v>

2261
01:45:32.660 --> 01:45:36.680
<v Speaker 5>he picked off calculus,</v>
<v Speaker 5>which is a corner of the possible things</v>

2262
01:45:36.681 --> 01:45:41.681
<v Speaker 5>that can happen in the computational </v>
<v Speaker 5>universe that happened to be an elegant </v>

2263
01:45:41.681 --> 01:45:42.050
<v Speaker 5>seashells,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so to speak.</v>

2264
01:45:42.260 --> 01:45:45.820
<v Speaker 5>They happened to be a case where you can</v>
<v Speaker 5>figure out what's going on and uh,</v>

2265
01:45:45.980 --> 01:45:50.980
<v Speaker 5>and so on,</v>
<v Speaker 5>while there is still the sort of ocean </v>

2266
01:45:50.980 --> 01:45:50.980
<v Speaker 5>of,</v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

2267
01:45:50.980 --> 01:45:52.940
<v Speaker 5>of other sort of computational </v>
<v Speaker 5>possibilities out there.</v>

2268
01:45:52.990 --> 01:45:53.490
<v Speaker 5>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but,</v>

2269
01:45:53.570 --> 01:45:54.550
<v Speaker 5>but when it comes to,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2270
01:45:54.560 --> 01:45:56.010
<v Speaker 5>you're asking about music.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I,</v>

2271
01:45:56.110 --> 01:46:01.110
<v Speaker 5>oH,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think my computer stopped being able </v>

2272
01:46:01.110 --> 01:46:01.890
<v Speaker 5>to get anywhere but,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but sort of interest in the,</v>

2273
01:46:02.450 --> 01:46:04.520
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>see if we can get to the site.</v>

2274
01:46:05.090 --> 01:46:10.090
<v Speaker 5>So this is a,</v>
<v Speaker 5>this is a website that we made years ago</v>

2275
01:46:11.330 --> 01:46:13.220
<v Speaker 5>and now my computer isn't playing on a </v>
<v Speaker 5>thing,</v>

2276
01:46:13.221 --> 01:46:18.221
<v Speaker 5>but let's try that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>

2277
01:46:23.981 --> 01:46:28.981
<v Speaker 5>So these things are created by basically</v>
<v Speaker 5>just searching computational universe of</v>

2278
01:46:29.351 --> 01:46:34.351
<v Speaker 5>possible programs.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's sort of interesting because </v>

2279
01:46:34.351 --> 01:46:37.380
<v Speaker 5>everyone has kind of a story.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Some of them look more interesting than </v>

2280
01:46:37.380 --> 01:46:37.380
<v Speaker 5>others.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Let's try that one</v>

2281
01:46:44.800 --> 01:46:45.310
<v Speaker 10>anyway.</v>

2282
01:46:45.580 --> 01:46:46.440
<v Speaker 5>The,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the um,</v>

2283
01:46:46.960 --> 01:46:48.340
<v Speaker 5>what's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what's interesting,</v>

2284
01:46:49.360 --> 01:46:53.100
<v Speaker 5>what was interesting to me about this </v>
<v Speaker 5>was this is a very trivial,</v>

2285
01:46:53.190 --> 01:46:58.190
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what this is doing is very trivial at </v>

2286
01:46:58.190 --> 01:46:58.190
<v Speaker 5>some level.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's just,</v>

2287
01:46:58.190 --> 01:46:58.590
<v Speaker 5>it actually happens to use cellular </v>
<v Speaker 5>automata.</v>

2288
01:46:58.830 --> 01:47:01.860
<v Speaker 5>You can even have it show you,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think someplace here.</v>

2289
01:47:02.160 --> 01:47:07.160
<v Speaker 5>Where is it?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Somewhere there's a way of showIng your </v>

2290
01:47:07.160 --> 01:47:07.160
<v Speaker 5>show the evolution.</v>
<v Speaker 5>This is,</v>

2291
01:47:07.160 --> 01:47:08.910
<v Speaker 5>this is showing the behind the scenes </v>
<v Speaker 5>what was actually happening,</v>

2292
01:47:09.660 --> 01:47:12.270
<v Speaker 5>what it chose to use to generate that </v>
<v Speaker 5>musical piece.</v>

2293
01:47:12.580 --> 01:47:13.930
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and uh,</v>

2294
01:47:15.120 --> 01:47:16.830
<v Speaker 5>what I thought was interesting about </v>
<v Speaker 5>this site,</v>

2295
01:47:18.060 --> 01:47:19.170
<v Speaker 5>I thought,</v>
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>

2296
01:47:19.230 --> 01:47:21.750
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>howard computers be relevant to music,</v>

2297
01:47:21.751 --> 01:47:22.250
<v Speaker 5>etc.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Etc.</v>

2298
01:47:22.310 --> 01:47:22.950
<v Speaker 5>Etc.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

2299
01:47:23.150 --> 01:47:28.150
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what would happen is a human would have </v>

2300
01:47:28.150 --> 01:47:29.640
<v Speaker 5>an idea and then the computer would kind</v>
<v Speaker 5>of dress up that idea and then,</v>

2301
01:47:29.670 --> 01:47:34.670
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>a bunch of years go by and I talked to </v>

2302
01:47:34.670 --> 01:47:35.130
<v Speaker 5>people who are composers and things and </v>
<v Speaker 5>they say,</v>

2303
01:47:35.160 --> 01:47:36.240
<v Speaker 5>oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I really liked that.</v>

2304
01:47:36.270 --> 01:47:37.320
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>from town site,</v>

2305
01:47:37.800 --> 01:47:38.970
<v Speaker 5>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's nice.</v>

2306
01:47:39.270 --> 01:47:44.270
<v Speaker 5>They say it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's a very good place for me to get </v>

2307
01:47:44.270 --> 01:47:45.600
<v Speaker 5>ideas.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So that's sort of the opposite of what I</v>

2308
01:47:45.601 --> 01:47:48.300
<v Speaker 5>would've expected.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Namely what's happening is,</v>

2309
01:47:48.590 --> 01:47:50.550
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>human comes here,</v>

2310
01:47:50.790 --> 01:47:54.180
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>listens to some ten second fragment.</v>

2311
01:47:54.750 --> 01:47:55.920
<v Speaker 5>And they said,</v>
<v Speaker 5>oh,</v>

2312
01:47:55.921 --> 01:47:59.730
<v Speaker 5>that's an interesting idea.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And then they kind of embellish it using</v>

2313
01:47:59.731 --> 01:48:02.010
<v Speaker 5>kind of something that is humanly </v>
<v Speaker 5>meaningful,</v>

2314
01:48:02.250 --> 01:48:03.660
<v Speaker 5>but it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2315
01:48:03.720 --> 01:48:08.720
<v Speaker 5>you're taking a photograph and you see </v>
<v Speaker 5>some interest in configuration and then </v>

2316
01:48:08.720 --> 01:48:08.910
<v Speaker 5>kind of your,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2317
01:48:08.911 --> 01:48:10.980
<v Speaker 5>you're filling that with kind of some </v>
<v Speaker 5>human,</v>

2318
01:48:11.290 --> 01:48:13.620
<v Speaker 5>a sort of context.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>

2319
01:48:13.650 --> 01:48:14.280
<v Speaker 5>but,</v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

2320
01:48:14.490 --> 01:48:17.060
<v Speaker 5>but,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so I'm not quite sure what,</v>

2321
01:48:17.770 --> 01:48:19.310
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

2322
01:48:20.700 --> 01:48:22.340
<v Speaker 5>what you were asking about.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

2323
01:48:22.380 --> 01:48:25.720
<v Speaker 5>back to the newton quote,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the thing that I think has some,</v>

2324
01:48:26.320 --> 01:48:29.010
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>another way to think about that quote is</v>

2325
01:48:29.400 --> 01:48:30.850
<v Speaker 5>us humans,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2326
01:48:31.020 --> 01:48:33.930
<v Speaker 5>with our sort of historical development </v>
<v Speaker 5>of,</v>

2327
01:48:34.010 --> 01:48:39.010
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>our intellectual history have explored </v>

2328
01:48:39.010 --> 01:48:43.160
<v Speaker 5>this very small corner of what's </v>
<v Speaker 5>possible in the computational universe </v>

2329
01:48:43.160 --> 01:48:46.260
<v Speaker 5>and everything that we care about is </v>
<v Speaker 5>contained in the small corner.</v>

2330
01:48:46.770 --> 01:48:48.020
<v Speaker 5>And that means that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2331
01:48:48.060 --> 01:48:49.590
<v Speaker 5>you could say,</v>
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>

2332
01:48:49.591 --> 01:48:50.880
<v Speaker 5>gee,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2333
01:48:50.970 --> 01:48:53.270
<v Speaker 5>I want to know what w,</v>
<v Speaker 5>w,</v>

2334
01:48:53.271 --> 01:48:58.271
<v Speaker 5>w,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what we end up wanting to talk about </v>

2335
01:48:58.271 --> 01:49:00.780
<v Speaker 5>other things that we as a society have </v>
<v Speaker 5>decided we care about and what.</v>

2336
01:49:00.830 --> 01:49:03.470
<v Speaker 5>There's an interesting feedback loop I </v>
<v Speaker 5>just mentioned it should end,</v>

2337
01:49:03.480 --> 01:49:04.290
<v Speaker 5>but,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but,</v>

2338
01:49:04.291 --> 01:49:06.300
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so you might say,</v>

2339
01:49:07.320 --> 01:49:08.430
<v Speaker 5>so here's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>here's a funny thing.</v>

2340
01:49:08.431 --> 01:49:10.320
<v Speaker 5>So let's take language,</v>
<v Speaker 5>for example,</v>

2341
01:49:10.560 --> 01:49:12.370
<v Speaker 5>language evolves.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We say we,</v>

2342
01:49:12.410 --> 01:49:15.180
<v Speaker 5>we make up language to describe what we </v>
<v Speaker 5>see in the world.</v>

2343
01:49:15.570 --> 01:49:16.740
<v Speaker 5>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 5>fine,</v>

2344
01:49:17.130 --> 01:49:20.460
<v Speaker 5>that's a fine idea.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Imagine the paleolithic times,</v>

2345
01:49:20.610 --> 01:49:25.610
<v Speaker 5>people will make up language.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They probably didn't have a word for </v>

2346
01:49:25.610 --> 01:49:25.610
<v Speaker 5>table because they didn't have any </v>
<v Speaker 5>tables.</v>

2347
01:49:26.340 --> 01:49:31.340
<v Speaker 5>They probably had a word for rock.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But then we ended up as a result of the </v>

2348
01:49:31.531 --> 01:49:32.980
<v Speaker 5>particular,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2349
01:49:33.000 --> 01:49:36.570
<v Speaker 5>development that our civilization has </v>
<v Speaker 5>gone through.</v>

2350
01:49:36.571 --> 01:49:41.571
<v Speaker 5>We build tables and there was sort of a </v>
<v Speaker 5>synergy between coming up with a word </v>

2351
01:49:41.941 --> 01:49:46.941
<v Speaker 5>for table and deciding tables were a </v>
<v Speaker 5>thing and we should build a bunch of </v>

2352
01:49:46.941 --> 01:49:46.941
<v Speaker 5>them.</v>

2353
01:49:46.941 --> 01:49:51.290
<v Speaker 5>And so there's this sort of complicated </v>
<v Speaker 5>interplay between the things that we </v>

2354
01:49:51.290 --> 01:49:55.021
<v Speaker 5>learn,</v>
<v Speaker 5>how to describe and how to think about </v>

2355
01:49:55.021 --> 01:49:57.390
<v Speaker 5>the things that we build and put an our </v>
<v Speaker 5>environment and then the things that we </v>

2356
01:49:57.390 --> 01:50:01.890
<v Speaker 5>end up wanting to talk about because </v>
<v Speaker 5>there are things that we have </v>

2357
01:50:01.890 --> 01:50:02.740
<v Speaker 5>experienced in our environment.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And so that's the,</v>

2358
01:50:02.850 --> 01:50:07.850
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think as we look at sort of the </v>

2359
01:50:07.850 --> 01:50:07.850
<v Speaker 5>progress of civilization,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there's,</v>

2360
01:50:07.850 --> 01:50:07.870
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there's various layers of.</v>

2361
01:50:08.110 --> 01:50:09.670
<v Speaker 5>First we,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2362
01:50:09.700 --> 01:50:12.850
<v Speaker 5>we invented a thing that we can then </v>
<v Speaker 5>think about and talk about.</v>

2363
01:50:13.330 --> 01:50:16.120
<v Speaker 5>Then we build an environment based on </v>
<v Speaker 5>that.</v>

2364
01:50:16.630 --> 01:50:19.840
<v Speaker 5>Then that allows us to do more stuff and</v>
<v Speaker 5>we build on top of that.</v>

2365
01:50:19.841 --> 01:50:20.910
<v Speaker 5>And that's why,</v>
<v Speaker 5>for example,</v>

2366
01:50:20.911 --> 01:50:25.911
<v Speaker 5>when we talk about computational </v>
<v Speaker 5>thinking and teaching it to kids and so </v>

2367
01:50:25.911 --> 01:50:28.441
<v Speaker 5>on,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's one reason that's kind of </v>

2368
01:50:28.441 --> 01:50:30.811
<v Speaker 5>important because we're building a layer</v>
<v Speaker 5>of things that people are then familiar </v>

2369
01:50:30.811 --> 01:50:32.380
<v Speaker 5>with that's different from what we've </v>
<v Speaker 5>had so far.</v>

2370
01:50:32.560 --> 01:50:34.020
<v Speaker 5>And they give people a way to talk about</v>
<v Speaker 5>things.</v>

2371
01:50:34.030 --> 01:50:36.590
<v Speaker 5>I'll give you one example that I'm </v>
<v Speaker 5>seated.</v>

2372
01:50:36.640 --> 01:50:38.230
<v Speaker 5>I have that still up the</v>

2373
01:50:39.190 --> 01:50:40.140
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>okay.</v>

2374
01:50:40.260 --> 01:50:41.070
<v Speaker 6>One,</v>
<v Speaker 6>one.</v>

2375
01:50:41.130 --> 01:50:44.710
<v Speaker 6>One example here,</v>
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

2376
01:50:47.170 --> 01:50:48.730
<v Speaker 5>from this blog post of mine.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Actually.</v>

2377
01:50:49.000 --> 01:50:49.660
<v Speaker 5>So</v>

2378
01:50:50.900 --> 01:50:52.360
<v Speaker 6>the.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Alright,</v>

2379
01:50:52.430 --> 01:50:53.980
<v Speaker 6>is it?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Okay.</v>

2380
01:50:53.981 --> 01:50:54.850
<v Speaker 6>So that,</v>

2381
01:50:56.280 --> 01:50:58.620
<v Speaker 5>that thIng,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there is a nested pattern,</v>

2382
01:50:58.990 --> 01:50:59.470
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's a,</v>

2383
01:50:59.730 --> 01:51:01.110
<v Speaker 5>it's a penske,</v>

2384
01:51:01.570 --> 01:51:03.650
<v Speaker 6>um,</v>
<v Speaker 6>that,</v>

2385
01:51:04.950 --> 01:51:05.430
<v Speaker 6>that</v>

2386
01:51:05.470 --> 01:51:08.030
<v Speaker 5>tile pattern was created in 12,</v>
<v Speaker 5>10,</v>

2387
01:51:08.070 --> 01:51:08.590
<v Speaker 5>80.</v>

2388
01:51:09.340 --> 01:51:14.340
<v Speaker 5>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's the first example I know of a </v>

2389
01:51:14.340 --> 01:51:14.340
<v Speaker 5>fractal pattern.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>

2390
01:51:14.340 --> 01:51:19.140
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the art historians wrote about these </v>

2391
01:51:19.140 --> 01:51:22.651
<v Speaker 5>patterns.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There are a bunch of his particular </v>

2392
01:51:22.651 --> 01:51:22.651
<v Speaker 5>style or pattern they wrote about these </v>
<v Speaker 5>for years.</v>

2393
01:51:22.651 --> 01:51:25.880
<v Speaker 5>They never diScussed that nest pattern.</v>
<v Speaker 5>These patterns also have,</v>

2394
01:51:25.881 --> 01:51:30.881
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>pictures of lions and elephants and </v>

2395
01:51:30.881 --> 01:51:31.030
<v Speaker 5>things like that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And then they wrote about those kinds of</v>

2396
01:51:31.031 --> 01:51:36.031
<v Speaker 5>things,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but they never mentioned the nested </v>

2397
01:51:36.031 --> 01:51:37.921
<v Speaker 5>pattern until basically about 25 years </v>
<v Speaker 5>ago when fractals and so on became a </v>

2398
01:51:39.761 --> 01:51:41.140
<v Speaker 5>thing.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And then it's,</v>

2399
01:51:41.170 --> 01:51:42.970
<v Speaker 5>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I can now talk about that.</v>

2400
01:51:42.971 --> 01:51:44.680
<v Speaker 5>It's a nested patterns,</v>
<v Speaker 5>fractal.</v>

2401
01:51:44.980 --> 01:51:45.990
<v Speaker 5>And then,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2402
01:51:46.180 --> 01:51:51.180
<v Speaker 5>before that time,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the art historians were blind to that </v>

2403
01:51:51.180 --> 01:51:51.400
<v Speaker 5>particular part of this pattern.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It was just like,</v>

2404
01:51:51.401 --> 01:51:53.230
<v Speaker 5>I don't know what that is,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that there's no,</v>

2405
01:51:53.260 --> 01:51:54.820
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't have a word to describe it.</v>

2406
01:51:54.850 --> 01:51:58.780
<v Speaker 5>I'M not going to,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm not going to talk about it.</v>

2407
01:51:58.780 --> 01:51:59.360
<v Speaker 5>So that's a,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2408
01:51:59.370 --> 01:52:04.120
<v Speaker 5>it's part of this feedback loop of,</v>
<v Speaker 5>of things that we learn to describe.</v>

2409
01:52:04.121 --> 01:52:07.150
<v Speaker 5>Then we build in terms of those things.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Then we built another layer.</v>

2410
01:52:07.420 --> 01:52:09.310
<v Speaker 5>I think one of the things,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean you talk about,</v>

2411
01:52:09.610 --> 01:52:13.180
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>just in the sort of thing,</v>

2412
01:52:13.340 --> 01:52:16.240
<v Speaker 5>one thing I'm really interested in is </v>
<v Speaker 5>the evolution of purposes.</v>

2413
01:52:16.480 --> 01:52:19.330
<v Speaker 5>So if you look back in human history,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there's a,</v>

2414
01:52:19.500 --> 01:52:24.500
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what was thought to be worth doing a </v>

2415
01:52:24.500 --> 01:52:25.030
<v Speaker 5>thousand years ago is different from </v>
<v Speaker 5>what's thought to be worth doing today.</v>

2416
01:52:25.480 --> 01:52:27.040
<v Speaker 5>And part of that is,</v>
<v Speaker 5>is,</v>

2417
01:52:27.041 --> 01:52:28.280
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

2418
01:52:28.570 --> 01:52:33.570
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>good examples of things like walking on </v>

2419
01:52:33.570 --> 01:52:35.050
<v Speaker 5>a treadmill or buying goods and virtual </v>
<v Speaker 5>worlds.</v>

2420
01:52:35.260 --> 01:52:40.260
<v Speaker 5>Both of theSe are hard to explain to </v>
<v Speaker 5>somebody from a thousand years ago </v>

2421
01:52:40.260 --> 01:52:42.850
<v Speaker 5>because each one ends up being a whole </v>
<v Speaker 5>sort of societal story about we're doing</v>

2422
01:52:42.851 --> 01:52:44.500
<v Speaker 5>this because we do that because we do </v>
<v Speaker 5>that.</v>

2423
01:52:44.830 --> 01:52:47.960
<v Speaker 5>And so the question is how will these </v>
<v Speaker 5>purposes evolve in the future?</v>

2424
01:52:48.410 --> 01:52:53.410
<v Speaker 5>And I think one of the things that I </v>
<v Speaker 5>view as a sort of sobering thought is </v>

2425
01:52:53.410 --> 01:52:56.801
<v Speaker 5>that that term,</v>
<v Speaker 5>actually one thing I found rather </v>

2426
01:52:56.801 --> 01:53:01.120
<v Speaker 5>disappointing and then I became less </v>
<v Speaker 5>pessimistic about it is if you think </v>

2427
01:53:01.120 --> 01:53:01.820
<v Speaker 5>about the future of the human condition </v>
<v Speaker 5>and you know,</v>

2428
01:53:01.821 --> 01:53:06.821
<v Speaker 5>we'd been successful in making ai </v>
<v Speaker 5>systems and we can read out brains and </v>

2429
01:53:06.821 --> 01:53:08.000
<v Speaker 5>we can upload consciousnesses and things</v>
<v Speaker 5>like that.</v>

2430
01:53:08.001 --> 01:53:11.240
<v Speaker 5>And we've actually got this box with </v>
<v Speaker 5>trillions of souls in it.</v>

2431
01:53:11.630 --> 01:53:13.520
<v Speaker 5>And the question is,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what are these souls doing?</v>

2432
01:53:13.910 --> 01:53:18.910
<v Speaker 5>And to us today,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it looks like they're playing video </v>

2433
01:53:18.910 --> 01:53:18.910
<v Speaker 5>games.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So the rest of eternity.</v>

2434
01:53:19.550 --> 01:53:21.740
<v Speaker 5>And that seems like a kind of a bad </v>
<v Speaker 5>outcome.</v>

2435
01:53:21.741 --> 01:53:25.280
<v Speaker 5>It's like we've gone through all of this</v>
<v Speaker 5>long history and what do we end up with?</v>

2436
01:53:25.281 --> 01:53:30.281
<v Speaker 5>We end up with a trillion souls in a box</v>
<v Speaker 5>playing video games and I thought this </v>

2437
01:53:31.221 --> 01:53:34.010
<v Speaker 5>is a very depressing outcome,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so to speak.</v>

2438
01:53:34.520 --> 01:53:39.520
<v Speaker 5>And then I realized that that actually,</v>
<v Speaker 5>if you look at the sort of arc of human </v>

2439
01:53:39.520 --> 01:53:42.830
<v Speaker 5>history people,</v>
<v Speaker 5>are there any given time in history,</v>

2440
01:53:43.100 --> 01:53:45.550
<v Speaker 5>people have been.</v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

2441
01:53:48.690 --> 01:53:51.470
<v Speaker 5>my main conclusion is that any time in </v>
<v Speaker 5>history,</v>

2442
01:53:51.471 --> 01:53:56.471
<v Speaker 5>the things people do seem meaningful and</v>
<v Speaker 5>purposeful to them at that time in </v>

2443
01:53:56.471 --> 01:53:59.450
<v Speaker 5>history and history moves on and you </v>
<v Speaker 5>know,</v>

2444
01:53:59.451 --> 01:54:03.560
<v Speaker 5>like a thousand years ago,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there were a lot of purposes that people</v>

2445
01:54:03.561 --> 01:54:08.561
<v Speaker 5>had that you know what to do with weird </v>
<v Speaker 5>superstitions and things like that that </v>

2446
01:54:08.561 --> 01:54:10.100
<v Speaker 5>we say,</v>
<v Speaker 5>why the heck were you doing that?</v>

2447
01:54:10.101 --> 01:54:12.360
<v Speaker 5>That just doesn't make any sense.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Right?</v>

2448
01:54:12.380 --> 01:54:15.470
<v Speaker 5>But to them at that time,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it made all the sense in the world.</v>

2449
01:54:15.800 --> 01:54:16.830
<v Speaker 5>And I think that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2450
01:54:16.940 --> 01:54:19.640
<v Speaker 5>the thing that makes me sort of less </v>
<v Speaker 5>depressed about the future,</v>

2451
01:54:19.820 --> 01:54:22.580
<v Speaker 5>so to speak,</v>
<v Speaker 5>is that at any given time in history,</v>

2452
01:54:22.800 --> 01:54:26.150
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you can still have meaningful purposes.</v>

2453
01:54:26.420 --> 01:54:31.420
<v Speaker 5>Even thOugh they may not look meaningful</v>
<v Speaker 5>from a different point in history and </v>

2454
01:54:31.420 --> 01:54:34.361
<v Speaker 5>that sort of a whole theory,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you can kind of build up based on kind </v>

2455
01:54:34.361 --> 01:54:37.691
<v Speaker 5>of the trajectories that you've followed</v>
<v Speaker 5>through the space of purposes and sort </v>

2456
01:54:37.691 --> 01:54:38.360
<v Speaker 5>of interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 5>If you can jump,</v>

2457
01:54:38.420 --> 01:54:43.420
<v Speaker 5>like you say,</v>
<v Speaker 5>let's get cryonically frozen for 300 </v>

2458
01:54:43.420 --> 01:54:47.471
<v Speaker 5>years and then be back again.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The the interest in cases.</v>

2459
01:54:47.661 --> 01:54:51.200
<v Speaker 5>Then you knoW all the purposes that you </v>
<v Speaker 5>sort of,</v>

2460
01:54:51.680 --> 01:54:54.590
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that you find yourself in ones that have</v>

2461
01:54:54.591 --> 01:54:57.620
<v Speaker 5>any continuity with what we know today.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I should stop with that.</v>

2462
01:54:57.621 --> 01:54:58.970
<v Speaker 5>That's a beautiful way to end it.</v>

2463
01:54:59.650 --> 01:55:00.300
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
