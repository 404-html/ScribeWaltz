1
00:00:00,550 --> 00:00:03,940
Today we're going to try something 
different.

2
00:00:04,030 --> 00:00:06,490
We're going to try a conversation.
Uh,

3
00:00:06,560 --> 00:00:11,560
have a Lisa Feldman Barrett with us.
She is a university distinguished 

4
00:00:11,560 --> 00:00:13,360
professor of psychology at Northeastern 
University,

5
00:00:13,630 --> 00:00:17,500
director of the Interdisciplinary 
Affective Science Laboratory,

6
00:00:17,980 --> 00:00:21,070
author of the new amazing book,
how emotions are made,

7
00:00:21,071 --> 00:00:24,310
the secret life of the brain.
She studies emotion,

8
00:00:24,670 --> 00:00:29,260
human emotion from social,
psychological,

9
00:00:29,290 --> 00:00:31,600
cognitive science and neuroscience 
perspectives.

10
00:00:31,960 --> 00:00:36,960
And so I think our conversation may help
us gain intuition about how we instill 

11
00:00:39,250 --> 00:00:44,250
emotional life into future artificial 
intelligence systems as Josh Tannenbaum 

12
00:00:45,800 --> 00:00:48,230
give you a shout out on Tuesday and said
that,

13
00:00:48,231 --> 00:00:53,231
uh,
if you want to understand how to create 

14
00:00:53,231 --> 00:00:55,400
artificial general intelligence systems 
from an engineering perspectives,

15
00:00:55,401 --> 00:00:59,870
which is study the human brain.
So with that,

16
00:01:00,410 --> 00:01:05,410
let's have some fun.
Let me start with a curve ball to a 

17
00:01:06,200 --> 00:01:11,200
conjure up an image of emotion.
Have you ever cried while watching a 

18
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:13,190
movie that you remember?
And what movie was it?

19
00:01:15,890 --> 00:01:18,760
I've cried during lots of.
Okay.

20
00:01:19,150 --> 00:01:22,160
Um,
let me think.

21
00:01:22,760 --> 00:01:27,470
The last time I cried.
Actually,

22
00:01:27,530 --> 00:01:32,530
here's an interesting thing.
When I'm speaking about when I'm giving 

23
00:01:32,530 --> 00:01:36,560
an academic talk,
I sometimes we'll talk about a study 

24
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:40,241
that we did where we had people watch 
films and we have them watch the most 

25
00:01:40,241 --> 00:01:44,591
evocative clips of films and there's 
several clips that are really powerful 

26
00:01:48,410 --> 00:01:52,440
and a couple of them,
every time I talk about them,

27
00:01:52,441 --> 00:01:53,670
I'm going to try not to cry.
Now.

28
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:58,920
Every time I talk about them,
I just scribing for the audience what 

29
00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:03,231
subjects are seeing.
One of the clips is from a movie called 

30
00:02:03,231 --> 00:02:04,710
Sophie's choice.
Does anyone know this film?

31
00:02:05,190 --> 00:02:10,190
Raise your hand if you know this film.
So we show this is a film about a woman 

32
00:02:10,190 --> 00:02:14,870
who is forced in a concentration camp to
choose which of her children will die in

33
00:02:15,391 --> 00:02:16,290
the gas chambers.

34
00:02:16,710 --> 00:02:18,060
And so I'm already,
you know,

35
00:02:18,750 --> 00:02:20,430
like if you were,
if I had um,

36
00:02:20,820 --> 00:02:22,950
heart rate monitor and respiration 
monitor,

37
00:02:22,951 --> 00:02:23,680
you would see,
um,

38
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:27,050
like it's a really powerful scene.
Um,

39
00:02:27,150 --> 00:02:31,320
Meryl Streep is Sophie and it's very,
very evocative.

40
00:02:33,170 --> 00:02:36,460
We have,
we also show there's a scene from a,

41
00:02:36,461 --> 00:02:41,461
a film with Susan Surandon who is dying 
of breast cancer and she has to tell her

42
00:02:42,581 --> 00:02:46,330
12 year old daughter that she's dying.
So there's another scene also that,

43
00:02:46,420 --> 00:02:51,420
um,
that I find very compelling and you use 

44
00:02:51,420 --> 00:02:54,130
these scenes to listen emotion as part 
of experiments we do.

45
00:02:54,190 --> 00:02:55,450
Yeah.
And in fact,

46
00:02:55,451 --> 00:03:00,451
I was just giving a presentation to the 
Judicial Court of Massachusetts on 

47
00:03:02,391 --> 00:03:07,391
implicit bias and to start the year,
they wanted to understand the 

48
00:03:07,391 --> 00:03:11,921
neuroscience of implicit bias and 
whether or not they should be crafting 

49
00:03:11,921 --> 00:03:16,600
jury instructions for juries to be aware
of implicit bias.

50
00:03:17,810 --> 00:03:20,690
And to open the discussion.

51
00:03:20,780 --> 00:03:25,210
I showed them a clip from a film that 
was filmed a,

52
00:03:25,250 --> 00:03:26,690
you know,
almost 20 years ago,

53
00:03:26,691 --> 00:03:31,691
actually called a time to kill the scene
where Matthew mcconaughey is this kind 

54
00:03:33,421 --> 00:03:38,421
of his,
his closing statements in a case where 

55
00:03:38,421 --> 00:03:38,421
he,
um,

56
00:03:38,421 --> 00:03:43,100
is defending an African American man who
murdered two European American men who 

57
00:03:44,161 --> 00:03:47,490
raped his 12 year old daughter.
And so the scene is,

58
00:03:47,550 --> 00:03:52,550
he's this completely pathetic lawyer 
until the end when he masters this 

59
00:03:52,741 --> 00:03:57,741
fantastic defense.
Basically of this man on trial for,

60
00:03:59,170 --> 00:04:04,170
you know,
basically avenging his daughter's death 

61
00:04:04,170 --> 00:04:06,840
and that one I hadn't seen that for 20 
years that film and it brought me to 

62
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:07,660
tears.
Actually.

63
00:04:07,960 --> 00:04:12,960
It's just a really powerful,
powerful scene and it's just really 

64
00:04:12,960 --> 00:04:17,640
punches you in the stomach.
You just can't help but just experienced

65
00:04:17,641 --> 00:04:22,641
that weight of racism in that,
in that room and the brilliance of the 

66
00:04:22,641 --> 00:04:26,140
closing argument to sort of puncture 
through it basically.

67
00:04:27,450 --> 00:04:29,310
Okay,
so experience.

68
00:04:29,610 --> 00:04:34,610
So one of the things you talk a lot and 
you're working in your book is the 

69
00:04:34,610 --> 00:04:37,050
difference in the experience of emotion 
and the expression of emotion.

70
00:04:38,300 --> 00:04:41,410
So what are,
what's our biggest misconception?

71
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:44,060
Bottom motion of folks that haven't 
considered,

72
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:48,620
have,
have only considered a emotions that are

73
00:04:48,621 --> 00:04:49,400
surface level.

74
00:04:50,100 --> 00:04:55,100
I would say one common misconception is 
that you can look at someone's face and 

75
00:04:58,771 --> 00:05:03,660
read their emotion the way you read 
words on a page that everyone around the

76
00:05:03,661 --> 00:05:05,520
world,
when they're feeling angry,

77
00:05:05,521 --> 00:05:07,950
they scowl.
When they're feeling happy,

78
00:05:07,951 --> 00:05:10,890
they smile when they're feeling sad,
that they frown.

79
00:05:11,100 --> 00:05:14,400
The way that I'm saying it sounds 
preposterous and it is preposterous,

80
00:05:14,430 --> 00:05:16,710
but unfortunately that is actually what 
people,

81
00:05:16,711 --> 00:05:21,711
a lot of people believe,
and tech companies around the world 

82
00:05:21,711 --> 00:05:24,530
spend tremendous amounts of money,
uh,

83
00:05:24,610 --> 00:05:29,610
and you know,
in the investment of some of the most 

84
00:05:29,610 --> 00:05:32,230
creative people on this planet trying to
build emotion detection systems,

85
00:05:32,710 --> 00:05:37,710
uh,
when really what they're building are 

86
00:05:37,710 --> 00:05:39,571
excellent systems for reading facial 
movements which have no intrinsic 

87
00:05:39,571 --> 00:05:40,870
emotional meeting.
I mean,

88
00:05:40,871 --> 00:05:43,840
sometimes facial movements communicate 
emotion,

89
00:05:43,841 --> 00:05:48,640
but many times they don't.
So people scowl for many reasons.

90
00:05:48,850 --> 00:05:52,030
They scowl when they're concentrating,
they scowl.

91
00:05:52,031 --> 00:05:56,200
Sometimes when they're sad,
they even can scowl when they're happy.

92
00:05:56,440 --> 00:06:01,070
People smile when they're angry,
they smile when they're sad.

93
00:06:01,071 --> 00:06:02,660
They don't just smile when they're 
happy,

94
00:06:02,661 --> 00:06:06,080
they sometimes smile to indicate a,
to send,

95
00:06:06,340 --> 00:06:11,340
you know,
a social message that has nothing to do 

96
00:06:11,340 --> 00:06:13,421
with emotion.
And so the idea that there's one 

97
00:06:13,421 --> 00:06:15,370
universal facial expression,
for example,

98
00:06:15,371 --> 00:06:16,780
for each emotion is just,

99
00:06:17,530 --> 00:06:22,530
okay,
there's no strong scientific evidence 

100
00:06:22,530 --> 00:06:22,530
for that claim.

101
00:06:22,530 --> 00:06:26,490
So how is emotion created them?
Because we nevertheless feel like we're 

102
00:06:26,490 --> 00:06:28,450
observing emotional when we're 
communicating with others.

103
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:33,720
So how does emotion,
the creation of emotion change in the 

104
00:06:33,901 --> 00:06:36,350
presence of others?
The,

105
00:06:36,920 --> 00:06:39,650
does the audience change the display of 
emotion?

106
00:06:39,651 --> 00:06:41,000
Is that essentially in the message?

107
00:06:41,550 --> 00:06:43,410
Well,
emotions are not displayed,

108
00:06:43,770 --> 00:06:45,330
I would say.
Right.

109
00:06:45,331 --> 00:06:50,331
So basically you and I are having a 
conversation right now and part of what 

110
00:06:51,900 --> 00:06:54,420
you know my brain is doing is it's 
guessing,

111
00:06:54,570 --> 00:06:58,020
make making educated guesses about what 
your facial movements mean.

112
00:06:58,070 --> 00:07:00,240
So right now you have a slight smile on 
your face.

113
00:07:00,241 --> 00:07:02,430
Not exactly a smirk,
but um,

114
00:07:03,640 --> 00:07:05,940
and so,
you know,

115
00:07:06,130 --> 00:07:08,080
um,
uh,

116
00:07:08,130 --> 00:07:13,130
so by the way,
so we're not allowed to show any 

117
00:07:13,130 --> 00:07:15,231
emotion.
You know,

118
00:07:15,330 --> 00:07:18,030
I have a friend of mine who was Russian 
who told me,

119
00:07:18,031 --> 00:07:19,980
and she would,
when she moved to this country,

120
00:07:20,140 --> 00:07:21,750
actually,
I've had several friends tell me this,

121
00:07:22,410 --> 00:07:26,430
that their cheeks hurt for a year for 
how much smiling they had to do.

122
00:07:26,640 --> 00:07:29,400
I've also found from the Netherlands who
moved here who told me the same thing.

123
00:07:29,401 --> 00:07:33,690
Her face ached for how much smiling she 
did an in Bulgaria.

124
00:07:33,690 --> 00:07:37,560
They haven't apparently like a a name 
for,

125
00:07:37,950 --> 00:07:39,480
you know,
the pervasive,

126
00:07:39,560 --> 00:07:41,700
a American smile,
kind of like a,

127
00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:46,470
not flattering name for how much 
American smile,

128
00:07:46,740 --> 00:07:49,650
but basically when you look at someone's
face,

129
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:54,680
you're making a guess about how they 
feel and although you yourself are 

130
00:07:54,680 --> 00:07:59,330
focused on their face to you,
it feels as if that's where all the 

131
00:07:59,330 --> 00:08:02,181
information is.
Your brain is actually taking in the 

132
00:08:02,181 --> 00:08:03,840
entire sensory ray,
so it's taking in also,

133
00:08:04,010 --> 00:08:09,010
you know,
the sound of the person's voice and the 

134
00:08:09,010 --> 00:08:12,200
person's body posture and the dynamic of
temporal changes in all of those signals

135
00:08:13,200 --> 00:08:14,910
to make sense of things.
It's not,

136
00:08:14,911 --> 00:08:18,180
you're not really.
The face is not a lighthouse.

137
00:08:18,270 --> 00:08:22,290
It's not a beacon that just displays 
somebody internal state in an obligatory

138
00:08:22,291 --> 00:08:22,650
way.

139
00:08:23,880 --> 00:08:27,750
Nevertheless,
there's some signal there of course.

140
00:08:28,170 --> 00:08:33,170
And so what are,
what would you say as far as I 

141
00:08:33,170 --> 00:08:34,800
understand there's no good answer yet 
from sciences.

142
00:08:34,801 --> 00:08:38,010
What are the basic building blocks of 
emotion?

143
00:08:39,110 --> 00:08:41,700
I wouldn't say that there's no good 
answer from science.

144
00:08:41,701 --> 00:08:46,701
I would say scientists disagree.
I think it's very clear what the 

145
00:08:46,701 --> 00:08:46,970
building blocks are.
Um,

146
00:08:47,460 --> 00:08:48,180
but,
you know,

147
00:08:49,530 --> 00:08:54,530
in one way or another,
if you look back all the way to ancient 

148
00:08:54,530 --> 00:08:55,050
Greece,
you can,

149
00:08:55,290 --> 00:09:00,290
that there are two kinds of views of 
emotion that had been battling it out 

150
00:09:00,840 --> 00:09:05,840
for millennia.
One is the idea that you have,

151
00:09:06,810 --> 00:09:07,380
um,
all,

152
00:09:07,390 --> 00:09:09,540
I will give you the modern versions of 
these views,

153
00:09:09,541 --> 00:09:11,550
but they really do have a very long 
history.

154
00:09:11,790 --> 00:09:16,790
One is the idea that you are born with 
circuits in your brain that are pre 

155
00:09:18,530 --> 00:09:23,530
prewired for emotion so that everybody 
around the world is born with an anger 

156
00:09:23,530 --> 00:09:24,210
circuit,
a fear circuit,

157
00:09:24,290 --> 00:09:26,580
sadness circuit,
a happiness circuit,

158
00:09:26,581 --> 00:09:29,880
some other circuits to you have them.
We all have them.

159
00:09:29,940 --> 00:09:34,170
All neurotypical brains have them and 
actually other animals have them too.

160
00:09:35,400 --> 00:09:39,660
And the idea is that when you know one 
of these circuses triggered,

161
00:09:39,900 --> 00:09:42,690
you have an emotional response,
which is obligatory.

162
00:09:43,320 --> 00:09:47,100
So you have a very stereotypic change in
your body.

163
00:09:47,101 --> 00:09:49,260
Your breathing changes in a stereotypic 
way.

164
00:09:49,261 --> 00:09:50,450
You're,
you know,

165
00:09:50,490 --> 00:09:52,260
heart rate changes,
your,

166
00:09:53,050 --> 00:09:56,270
the chemicals in your body change in a 
particular way.

167
00:09:56,300 --> 00:09:59,070
You make a particular facial expression 
and you are,

168
00:09:59,071 --> 00:10:03,330
I'm a have a propensity to make a 
particular action like you,

169
00:10:03,540 --> 00:10:07,500
you know,
attack and anger and you run in fear are

170
00:10:07,501 --> 00:10:09,850
you freezing here.
Um,

171
00:10:10,310 --> 00:10:12,410
and then there's another view which 
says,

172
00:10:13,670 --> 00:10:16,940
well,
there are some basic kind of ingredients

173
00:10:16,941 --> 00:10:20,150
or building blocks that the human mind 
or the human brain.

174
00:10:20,151 --> 00:10:21,580
Now,
um,

175
00:10:21,810 --> 00:10:26,810
people talk about the brain.
Now there are some basic ingredients 

176
00:10:26,810 --> 00:10:30,191
that your brain uses a and it uses them 
to make every kind of mental event that 

177
00:10:30,191 --> 00:10:31,790
you experienced.
And every action that you take,

178
00:10:31,970 --> 00:10:34,700
the recipes are what are unique.

179
00:10:34,700 --> 00:10:36,890
The ingredients are common,
right?

180
00:10:36,891 --> 00:10:41,891
Just like you can take flour and water 
and salt and you can make a whole bunch 

181
00:10:41,891 --> 00:10:45,131
of different recipes with them,
some of which aren't even food like 

182
00:10:45,131 --> 00:10:46,490
glue.
I'm in a similar way.

183
00:10:46,491 --> 00:10:51,491
The idea is that your brain has some 
kind of all purpose capacities and it 

184
00:10:51,491 --> 00:10:55,631
can,
it puts these ingredients together and 

185
00:10:55,631 --> 00:10:57,170
it makes a motion as you need them on 
the spot and you don't have one anger.

186
00:10:57,171 --> 00:11:00,880
You have a whole repertoire of anger.
You don't have one sadness.

187
00:11:00,910 --> 00:11:04,340
You have a whole repertoire of sadness 
and if you grow up in a culture that has

188
00:11:04,341 --> 00:11:09,341
no concept for sadness,
you don't experience sadness and you 

189
00:11:09,341 --> 00:11:12,701
don't perceive sadness because your 
brain becomes wired to make whatever 

190
00:11:12,771 --> 00:11:17,690
mental events that are exist in your 
particular culture.

191
00:11:18,670 --> 00:11:23,670
So for artificial intelligence systems,
the idea of emotional intelligence is 

192
00:11:24,561 --> 00:11:28,280
really difficult and it seems like it's 
an important thing to try to instill.

193
00:11:28,580 --> 00:11:33,580
So for human beings,
where do you see the importance on the 

194
00:11:33,580 --> 00:11:36,670
priority list of what makes us human?
Where does emotion sit?

195
00:11:38,040 --> 00:11:42,990
I think that's the wrong question to ask
because I'm.

196
00:11:43,900 --> 00:11:45,000
No,
I mean I think.

197
00:11:45,030 --> 00:11:47,190
I think people constantly ask that 
question,

198
00:11:47,191 --> 00:11:49,620
but I don't think it's the right 
question to ask because you know,

199
00:11:49,621 --> 00:11:54,621
some cultures in our,
on our planet don't have a concept for 

200
00:11:54,911 --> 00:11:59,911
emotion and people don't.
While they experience what I'm going to 

201
00:12:00,220 --> 00:12:03,730
refer to as a in scientific terms we 
call an effect,

202
00:12:03,731 --> 00:12:08,731
which is our simple feelings of feeling 
pleasant or unpleasant or feeling worked

203
00:12:08,801 --> 00:12:11,100
up or calm or comfortable or disc or you
know,

204
00:12:11,110 --> 00:12:16,110
having discomfort.
These are feelings that come directly 

205
00:12:16,110 --> 00:12:19,141
from the internal state of the physical 
systems in your body.

206
00:12:20,020 --> 00:12:22,900
Not everybody makes emotions out of 
those feelings,

207
00:12:22,960 --> 00:12:27,960
and in fact,
we often don't make emotions out of 

208
00:12:27,960 --> 00:12:27,960
those foods.
So let's feelings.

209
00:12:27,960 --> 00:12:31,390
The way to think about it is that your 
brain comes wired to regulate your body.

210
00:12:31,570 --> 00:12:36,570
Actually sort of take that back you.
Your brain becomes wired when you're 

211
00:12:36,570 --> 00:12:41,161
born,
your brain becomes wired with the 

212
00:12:41,161 --> 00:12:42,361
potential to regulate your body.
Infants actually don't regulate their 

213
00:12:42,361 --> 00:12:44,770
own nervous systems very well.
They can't put themselves to sleep.

214
00:12:45,100 --> 00:12:50,100
They can't calm themselves down.
They can't regulate their own 

215
00:12:50,100 --> 00:12:52,330
temperature.
That's what they need caregivers for.

216
00:12:52,540 --> 00:12:57,540
And as caregivers regulate the nervous 
systems of their infants that wires the 

217
00:12:57,540 --> 00:12:58,960
infant's brain,
right?

218
00:12:58,961 --> 00:13:01,350
So infant little infant brains aren't 
born,

219
00:13:01,740 --> 00:13:04,120
uh,
like little miniature adult brains.

220
00:13:04,150 --> 00:13:09,150
They're born at waiting for a set of 
wiring instructions from the world and 

221
00:13:09,371 --> 00:13:14,200
they wire themselves to the physical and
social realities that they grow in.

222
00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:18,640
And as they learn to do this,
they,

223
00:13:18,950 --> 00:13:20,740
um,
experience,

224
00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:24,020
uh,
these simple feelings that you know,

225
00:13:24,021 --> 00:13:25,810
of,
feeling pleasant or unpleasant,

226
00:13:25,811 --> 00:13:30,811
feeling worked up or feeling calm.
These are kind of like barometer 

227
00:13:30,811 --> 00:13:30,811
readings in a way.

228
00:13:30,811 --> 00:13:34,840
They're very simple and they lack a lot 
of detail because of how we're wired,

229
00:13:35,410 --> 00:13:37,480
um,
and we have to make sense of them.

230
00:13:37,870 --> 00:13:41,020
And the way the culture makes sense of 
them is not always about emotion.

231
00:13:41,021 --> 00:13:42,610
So I would say,
you know,

232
00:13:42,940 --> 00:13:45,670
in our culture,
when we lose something significant,

233
00:13:45,671 --> 00:13:50,671
like a loved one,
we feel sad into he into Haitian people 

234
00:13:50,861 --> 00:13:53,920
feel sick.
They have an illness.

235
00:13:54,040 --> 00:13:59,040
It's not sadness.
A hundred or 200 years ago there was an 

236
00:13:59,040 --> 00:14:03,811
emotion called nostalgia,
which killed people was thought to kill 

237
00:14:04,031 --> 00:14:05,240
people after,
you know,

238
00:14:05,260 --> 00:14:07,540
for example,
after serving in world war one,

239
00:14:07,750 --> 00:14:11,410
we would now call that depression.

240
00:14:14,050 --> 00:14:19,050
It's not just a matter of changing the 
label of something and it's actually the

241
00:14:20,350 --> 00:14:22,510
formation of the experience is very 
different.

242
00:14:22,511 --> 00:14:25,570
So if you want to build an intelligent 
agent,

243
00:14:25,870 --> 00:14:29,380
I don't think emotion is what you need 
to endow it with.

244
00:14:29,381 --> 00:14:34,381
You need to endow it with these basic 
ingredients that it can use to make 

245
00:14:34,381 --> 00:14:38,800
whatever experiences or guide whatever 
actions,

246
00:14:38,860 --> 00:14:43,860
make whatever states or guide whatever 
actions are relevant to the situations 

247
00:14:43,860 --> 00:14:48,301
that it's in.
That will be different if it's an 

248
00:14:48,301 --> 00:14:50,791
American or a British or a western 
urbanized environment than say if you 

249
00:14:52,371 --> 00:14:56,240
were to go to Tanzania and steady,
you know,

250
00:14:56,241 --> 00:15:00,170
the Hadza who were hunting and gathering
since that culture,

251
00:15:00,171 --> 00:15:05,171
since the pleistocene words or human 
interpretable labels on these basic 

252
00:15:07,581 --> 00:15:10,250
ingredients that we can understand.
I think so.

253
00:15:10,460 --> 00:15:12,680
I mean,
I think the first thing to understand is

254
00:15:12,681 --> 00:15:17,681
that when we think about building an 
intelligent agent,

255
00:15:17,931 --> 00:15:22,931
we think about endowing the agent with 
cognition or with emotion or the ability

256
00:15:24,801 --> 00:15:25,170
to,
to,

257
00:15:25,310 --> 00:15:30,310
you know,
to perceive things in the world because 

258
00:15:30,310 --> 00:15:34,150
as humans that those are.
These are the things that are really 

259
00:15:34,150 --> 00:15:34,250
important to us,
especially in our culture,

260
00:15:34,310 --> 00:15:35,420
thinking,
feeling,

261
00:15:35,421 --> 00:15:37,550
seeing,
and other cultures.

262
00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:43,320
You know,
they have different ways of parsing 

263
00:15:43,320 --> 00:15:43,640
things,
but the truth is that your brain did not

264
00:15:43,641 --> 00:15:48,641
evolve so that you could think and feel 
and see.

265
00:15:51,530 --> 00:15:55,190
It evolved.
Brains evolved to control bodies.

266
00:15:57,200 --> 00:16:02,200
Brains evolved so that they could 
control the various systems of the body 

267
00:16:04,280 --> 00:16:09,280
as creatures move around in order to 
gain resources like food and water and a

268
00:16:13,791 --> 00:16:18,791
brain has to figure out how much 
resources to expand on getting 

269
00:16:19,761 --> 00:16:23,090
additional resources.
Now that may sound really trivial,

270
00:16:23,091 --> 00:16:28,091
but it turns out it's actually really 
hard and scientists actually haven't 

271
00:16:28,091 --> 00:16:30,290
really figured out completely how brains
do this.

272
00:16:31,700 --> 00:16:36,700
I mean,
what's really interesting to me is that 

273
00:16:36,700 --> 00:16:36,700
if you look,
for example,

274
00:16:36,700 --> 00:16:37,010
at computer vision,
try to figure out,

275
00:16:37,011 --> 00:16:38,270
you know,
how an,

276
00:16:38,360 --> 00:16:40,280
how to make,
um,

277
00:16:40,281 --> 00:16:43,370
an agent.
See that's a pretty much solved problem.

278
00:16:43,400 --> 00:16:46,940
Not Completely.
It's a pretty much solved problem in the

279
00:16:46,941 --> 00:16:48,930
basics are solved your perception 
problem.

280
00:16:49,030 --> 00:16:50,540
Yeah,
the pure perception problem.

281
00:16:50,600 --> 00:16:54,710
However,
if you want to create an agent that just

282
00:16:54,740 --> 00:16:58,070
reaches out smoothly,
grabs a glass,

283
00:16:58,280 --> 00:17:03,280
and brings it into the body to drink 
that problem is not solved something as 

284
00:17:03,981 --> 00:17:08,981
simple as movement,
which we think of as this really basic 

285
00:17:08,981 --> 00:17:08,981
thing like,
oh,

286
00:17:08,981 --> 00:17:08,981
it's so trivial.

287
00:17:08,981 --> 00:17:13,360
All animals can do it is actually the 
harder one of the hardest problems to 

288
00:17:13,360 --> 00:17:17,150
solve.
And brains basically.

289
00:17:17,480 --> 00:17:22,480
I mean,
there's a whole story here about 

290
00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:24,491
evolution,
which has nothing to do with having a 

291
00:17:24,491 --> 00:17:24,491
lizard brain which is wrapped in a,
you know,

292
00:17:24,491 --> 00:17:27,100
a cognitive brain or anything like that.
Um,

293
00:17:27,910 --> 00:17:29,900
uh,
that's a reference to the triune brain,

294
00:17:29,901 --> 00:17:34,901
which a lot of people believe it's a way
of thinking about brain evolution 

295
00:17:34,901 --> 00:17:35,230
instead.
Um,

296
00:17:35,240 --> 00:17:40,240
what we,
what seems to be the case is that as 

297
00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:40,240
bodies got larger,
um,

298
00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:44,750
and there were more systems because the 
niche of the animal,

299
00:17:44,751 --> 00:17:49,751
the environment,
the animal got bigger and bigger and 

300
00:17:49,751 --> 00:17:49,751
bigger.
Brains also had to get bigger,

301
00:17:49,751 --> 00:17:53,580
but they had to get bigger to a point 
with some constraints.

302
00:17:53,850 --> 00:17:56,460
Like they have to be.
You have to keep,

303
00:17:56,650 --> 00:18:00,180
um,
metabolic cost down.

304
00:18:00,181 --> 00:18:02,220
It's really important.
If you don't,

305
00:18:02,280 --> 00:18:04,410
you know,
creatures get sick and die.

306
00:18:04,800 --> 00:18:09,800
Um,
we can talk about what that means in 

307
00:18:09,800 --> 00:18:09,800
terms of depression or metabolic 
illnesses or what have you.

308
00:18:09,800 --> 00:18:11,310
But so what are the basic ingredients?
Well,

309
00:18:11,311 --> 00:18:16,311
one of the basic ingredients is that 
your brain is controlling your body all 

310
00:18:16,311 --> 00:18:17,010
the time.
Whether you feel it or not,

311
00:18:17,011 --> 00:18:20,280
whether you're thinking about it or not,
whether you're asleep or awake,

312
00:18:20,670 --> 00:18:25,170
certain parts of your brain are always 
very active all the time,

313
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:28,140
even when you're sleeping or else you'd 
be dead,

314
00:18:29,160 --> 00:18:34,160
and those parts of the brain that are 
controlling your heart and your lungs 

315
00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:38,670
and your immune system and all of those 
regions that are controlling the systems

316
00:18:38,671 --> 00:18:43,671
of your body are also helping your brain
to represent the sensory consequences of

317
00:18:46,170 --> 00:18:49,920
those changes in your body,
which you don't feel directly.

318
00:18:50,820 --> 00:18:53,730
You don't feel your heart beating most 
of the time.

319
00:18:53,940 --> 00:18:58,940
You don't feel your lungs expanding most
of the time and there's a really good 

320
00:18:58,951 --> 00:19:03,210
reason why we are all wired not to feel 
those things,

321
00:19:03,360 --> 00:19:08,360
and that is you'd never pay attention to
anything outside in the world ever 

322
00:19:08,360 --> 00:19:11,541
again.
If you could feel every little movement 

323
00:19:11,541 --> 00:19:14,181
that was going on inside your body,
so your brain represents those as a 

324
00:19:14,181 --> 00:19:15,420
summary.
These kinds of simple summary feelings.

325
00:19:15,421 --> 00:19:17,190
You feel good,
you feel bad,

326
00:19:17,250 --> 00:19:19,110
you feel great.
You feel like shit.

327
00:19:19,380 --> 00:19:21,870
You feel really jittery.
You feel really calm,

328
00:19:22,470 --> 00:19:26,220
and these feelings are not emotions.
They sometimes keep your brain,

329
00:19:26,221 --> 00:19:30,120
can make them into emotions,
but they're with you every waking moment

330
00:19:30,121 --> 00:19:30,900
of your life.

331
00:19:32,950 --> 00:19:37,950
There are properties of consciousness in
the way that lightness and darkness is a

332
00:19:38,881 --> 00:19:43,881
property of vision,
and sometimes we make them into emotions

333
00:19:44,551 --> 00:19:49,551
when they're,
when we have a big change in our heart 

334
00:19:49,551 --> 00:19:49,590
rate or a big change in our,
um,

335
00:19:49,710 --> 00:19:54,710
in our breathing rate or a big change in
our temperature or a big surge of 

336
00:19:54,710 --> 00:19:55,990
glucose,
um,

337
00:19:56,070 --> 00:20:01,070
we,
my brain might make a emotion out of 

338
00:20:01,070 --> 00:20:03,240
those changes,
those very strong changes which you will

339
00:20:03,241 --> 00:20:06,780
feel as really feeling unpleasant or 
really feeling pleasant,

340
00:20:07,230 --> 00:20:11,550
but your brain might also make hunger or
your brain might make an instance of,

341
00:20:11,800 --> 00:20:14,090
um,
uh,

342
00:20:14,360 --> 00:20:19,360
a physical sensation like nausea or your
brain might even make a perception of 

343
00:20:20,461 --> 00:20:21,750
the world.
Like,

344
00:20:22,140 --> 00:20:25,530
that's a nice guy.
That guy's an asshole.

345
00:20:25,920 --> 00:20:29,730
This is a really delicious drink.
That's a beautiful painting.

346
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:33,120
Those are also moments where these 
simple feelings,

347
00:20:33,121 --> 00:20:37,980
which we call an effect are very strong.
So aspect is a basic ingredient.

348
00:20:39,750 --> 00:20:41,550
There are others that I could talk about
too.

349
00:20:41,551 --> 00:20:44,280
It's not the only one,
but one of the things I think that,

350
00:20:44,281 --> 00:20:49,281
um,
that sometimes people who are to build 

351
00:20:49,281 --> 00:20:53,640
ai systems don't realize is that the 
brain,

352
00:20:54,640 --> 00:20:59,640
its fundamental job is to keep your body
alive and well.

353
00:21:00,890 --> 00:21:05,890
And if you don't have some kind of body 
to regulate with effective feelings that

354
00:21:08,271 --> 00:21:10,160
come from that regulation

355
00:21:12,230 --> 00:21:17,230
or something like that,
it's you're kind of going to be out of 

356
00:21:17,481 --> 00:21:22,481
luck.
I think in rendering something that 

357
00:21:22,481 --> 00:21:23,330
looks more something that seems more 
human,

358
00:21:24,070 --> 00:21:27,350
right?
So maybe you can elaborate a like in the

359
00:21:27,351 --> 00:21:32,351
book sapiens that we as human beings are
really good en masse as a,

360
00:21:33,130 --> 00:21:38,130
with thousands,
millions of people together believing 

361
00:21:38,130 --> 00:21:38,130
something,
even if it's not true.

362
00:21:38,130 --> 00:21:42,550
So,
so while scientifically sort of from a 

363
00:21:42,661 --> 00:21:46,290
neuroscience perspective is maybe very 
true that emotions aren't real.

364
00:21:48,080 --> 00:21:50,850
But I said they're not there.
There isn't.

365
00:21:50,851 --> 00:21:52,750
So it interesting are you finished?

366
00:21:53,390 --> 00:21:58,390
So what I'm trying to say is also from a
perspective is they become these trivial

367
00:22:00,980 --> 00:22:05,980
ideas of mapping a smile to being happy 
and these kinds of trivial ideas become 

368
00:22:05,980 --> 00:22:10,481
real to us through Hollywood,
through cultural spreading that 

369
00:22:10,481 --> 00:22:14,591
information.
And we start to believe this and 

370
00:22:14,591 --> 00:22:15,120
therefore it becomes real innocent in,
in,

371
00:22:15,570 --> 00:22:20,330
in as much as anything is real about our
called our perception together.

372
00:22:20,510 --> 00:22:24,980
So it's really important scientifically 
the ideas that you're presenting.

373
00:22:25,010 --> 00:22:30,010
But does that mean there's just because 
our brain doesn't feel those explicit 

374
00:22:30,010 --> 00:22:31,670
emotions,
does that mean they're not real?

375
00:22:31,920 --> 00:22:33,990
I didn't say we don't feel explicit 
emotions.

376
00:22:34,290 --> 00:22:38,250
So I want to be really clear about this 
because it's an interesting this,

377
00:22:38,410 --> 00:22:38,950
you know,
this,

378
00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:40,950
um,
this

379
00:22:41,880 --> 00:22:46,880
in France,
it's an interesting inference that 

380
00:22:46,880 --> 00:22:46,880
people often make.
And so,

381
00:22:46,880 --> 00:22:51,580
but it's,
it's a mistake and it's a mistake that 

382
00:22:51,580 --> 00:22:53,660
betrays a certain kind of thinking that 
we do in this culture.

383
00:22:54,350 --> 00:22:56,540
And it's,
it's the mistake of the following sort.

384
00:22:56,541 --> 00:23:01,541
So when I say there is no facial 
expression that is diagnostic of a 

385
00:23:02,271 --> 00:23:07,271
single emotion,
that doesn't mean that people don't 

386
00:23:07,271 --> 00:23:10,010
express emotion.
They certainly do express emotion.

387
00:23:10,011 --> 00:23:11,600
They just don't,
you know,

388
00:23:11,601 --> 00:23:13,580
when,
when they're in a state of anger,

389
00:23:13,581 --> 00:23:17,480
in a state of sadness or an estate of 
all their faces don't do one thing.

390
00:23:17,750 --> 00:23:19,250
When I say,
well,

391
00:23:19,251 --> 00:23:23,730
your body can do many things when you're
angry or when you're sad or,

392
00:23:23,760 --> 00:23:26,010
but let's take anger.
Your heart rate can go up,

393
00:23:26,040 --> 00:23:28,020
it can go down,
it can stay the same.

394
00:23:28,080 --> 00:23:30,330
Your breathing rate can go up,
it can go down,

395
00:23:30,360 --> 00:23:31,350
it can stay the same.

396
00:23:31,930 --> 00:23:36,930
The same pattern that you see in anger 
you sometimes see in sadness and you 

397
00:23:36,930 --> 00:23:41,251
sometimes see in fear.
You sometimes even see it in enthusiasm 

398
00:23:41,251 --> 00:23:41,251
and in.
All right,

399
00:23:41,251 --> 00:23:43,430
so does that mean that emotions aren't 
real?

400
00:23:43,490 --> 00:23:44,930
No.
Emotions are real,

401
00:23:45,380 --> 00:23:50,380
but,
but sometimes things are real because 

402
00:23:50,450 --> 00:23:55,450
the physical meaning of the signal is 
endowed in the signal.

403
00:23:57,010 --> 00:24:01,790
Okay?
So when your retina communicates to your

404
00:24:01,791 --> 00:24:06,791
brain that you have,
that you are faced with a wavelength of 

405
00:24:06,791 --> 00:24:06,791
that,
you know,

406
00:24:06,791 --> 00:24:09,590
is 600,
600 nanometers.

407
00:24:11,060 --> 00:24:14,780
The signal is endowed in your brain.
That's like in the signal.

408
00:24:14,781 --> 00:24:18,380
It's not like interpreted on interpret 
that it's 600 nanometers.

409
00:24:18,381 --> 00:24:21,530
It is 600 nanometers.
The information's in the signal,

410
00:24:22,670 --> 00:24:27,670
but when you see read,
that information is not in the signal.

411
00:24:29,990 --> 00:24:34,580
Your brain has added information that 
isn't in the signal itself.

412
00:24:34,610 --> 00:24:39,610
In a sense,
your brain has imposed meaning on a 

413
00:24:39,610 --> 00:24:42,710
signal that the signal doesn't have on 
its own.

414
00:24:43,340 --> 00:24:48,340
The let me back up and give a different 
example to make it a little easier and 

415
00:24:48,340 --> 00:24:50,060
then will reapproach this.
There's is a,

416
00:24:50,840 --> 00:24:53,900
there are some things that we impose.
In fact,

417
00:24:54,140 --> 00:24:57,020
this is true almost all civilization,
right?

418
00:24:57,290 --> 00:25:02,290
That we,
there are some things that are real by 

419
00:25:02,290 --> 00:25:02,570
virtue of the fact that we agree that 
they exist.

420
00:25:03,950 --> 00:25:08,930
Little pieces of paper serve as money or
now,

421
00:25:08,980 --> 00:25:13,980
you know,
bit coin or little pieces of plastic or 

422
00:25:13,980 --> 00:25:17,711
gold or diamonds,
or in the past barley,

423
00:25:17,780 --> 00:25:22,780
salt shells,
rocks serve as currency,

424
00:25:23,330 --> 00:25:27,440
have value only because a group of 
people agree that they have value.

425
00:25:28,310 --> 00:25:33,310
So we impose meaning on objects.
And once we all agree that that object 

426
00:25:36,440 --> 00:25:39,230
actually has value,
we can trade it for material goods.

427
00:25:39,470 --> 00:25:43,040
The minute that some of us disagree,
that,

428
00:25:43,110 --> 00:25:43,770
uh,
we,

429
00:25:44,010 --> 00:25:47,510
we withdraw our consent,
right?

430
00:25:48,790 --> 00:25:53,790
The things lose their value.
That's what happened in the mortgage 

431
00:25:53,790 --> 00:25:53,790
crisis.

432
00:25:53,790 --> 00:25:56,090
That's what happened in the tulip.
Crisis in the,

433
00:25:56,100 --> 00:25:58,160
in the Netherlands.
Uh,

434
00:25:58,280 --> 00:26:03,280
in the 17th century or 16th century 
Renner was money.

435
00:26:04,310 --> 00:26:09,310
Currency exists because we impose 
meaning on objects in the world,

436
00:26:10,970 --> 00:26:15,970
physical objects in the world that 
themselves don't have that meeting on 

437
00:26:15,970 --> 00:26:18,770
their own and they are very real money 
is very real to people.

438
00:26:18,771 --> 00:26:23,771
I can stick somebody's head in a brain 
scanner and show you that they 

439
00:26:23,771 --> 00:26:26,270
experienced value in a very real way,
but that,

440
00:26:26,370 --> 00:26:31,370
that reality is constructed by,
um,

441
00:26:32,120 --> 00:26:36,230
the fact that they have learned the 
value in a particular culture.

442
00:26:36,440 --> 00:26:38,570
Well,
that's also what we do with emotion.

443
00:26:38,630 --> 00:26:43,630
We impose meaning on certain physical 
signals that they don't have by

444
00:26:44,020 --> 00:26:47,110
on their own and,
but we have collective intentionality.

445
00:26:47,111 --> 00:26:52,111
We all agree that scowling is sometimes 
anger and so it becomes anger in a very 

446
00:26:54,461 --> 00:26:59,461
real way.
Just like little pieces of paper become 

447
00:26:59,461 --> 00:27:02,671
money.
So it sounds like you kind of think 

448
00:27:02,671 --> 00:27:03,050
about the expression of emotions,
that kind of language as an extension of

449
00:27:03,051 --> 00:27:08,051
a language that we'll learn in the same 
way that we've collectively agree on a 

450
00:27:08,051 --> 00:27:11,900
language and the lexicon and a how we 
use that language.

451
00:27:12,660 --> 00:27:14,190
Sure.
You could think of it that way.

452
00:27:14,191 --> 00:27:15,870
I mean,
everything,

453
00:27:16,230 --> 00:27:21,230
everything in our culture is almost 
everything in our culture is a function 

454
00:27:24,041 --> 00:27:25,960
of social reality in this way,
right?

455
00:27:26,540 --> 00:27:31,540
Um,
we are citizens of a country because we 

456
00:27:31,540 --> 00:27:32,860
all agree that the country exists more 
or less.

457
00:27:33,400 --> 00:27:34,750
And I'm.
Wow,

458
00:27:34,751 --> 00:27:36,610
you guys barely even laughed at that.
Okay.

459
00:27:37,590 --> 00:27:41,140
Um,
what's a revolution a revolution is when

460
00:27:41,141 --> 00:27:43,360
some people in the country withdraw 
their consent.

461
00:27:43,990 --> 00:27:47,040
They no longer agree,
right?

462
00:27:47,100 --> 00:27:52,100
A president has powers in a country 
because we all agree that a president 

463
00:27:52,100 --> 00:27:55,731
has powers.
President only has powers by virtue the 

464
00:27:55,731 --> 00:27:55,731
fact that we all agree that he or she 
has powers.

465
00:27:55,800 --> 00:28:00,800
If we stop agreeing,
the president doesn't have those powers 

466
00:28:00,851 --> 00:28:03,190
anymore.
It's very real.

467
00:28:03,830 --> 00:28:08,830
People's lives depend on outcomes of 
real people depend on these social 

468
00:28:10,131 --> 00:28:15,131
realities that we build and nurture and 
we wire these social realities into the 

469
00:28:15,131 --> 00:28:17,510
brains of our children as we socialize 
them.

470
00:28:17,690 --> 00:28:20,240
And when people move from one culture to
another,

471
00:28:20,300 --> 00:28:25,300
they have to learn the new,
a social reality that they are faced 

472
00:28:25,300 --> 00:28:26,570
with.
And if they don't,

473
00:28:26,960 --> 00:28:31,960
they get very sick physically.
Because our ability to agree on what 

474
00:28:33,141 --> 00:28:37,070
something means actually is important 
for regulating our nervous systems.

475
00:28:37,130 --> 00:28:39,260
So can you speak to that a little bit?
I mean,

476
00:28:39,320 --> 00:28:44,320
for machine learning methods,
for systems that learn to behave based 

477
00:28:44,511 --> 00:28:49,511
on a certain reward,
it's important to Kinda have some ground

478
00:28:50,761 --> 00:28:55,761
truth and learn.
So how do it sounds like the expression 

479
00:28:55,761 --> 00:29:00,621
of emotion is learned.
Can you talk about how we learn to fit 

480
00:29:00,621 --> 00:29:05,140
into our culture by expressing emotion 
with our phase body,

481
00:29:05,170 --> 00:29:06,820
given the context,
given the rich,

482
00:29:06,880 --> 00:29:08,830
uh,
what's that process look like?

483
00:29:08,831 --> 00:29:11,840
When does it happen?
How much?

484
00:29:13,790 --> 00:29:15,940
Yeah,
I wrote a 400 page book,

485
00:29:15,941 --> 00:29:18,140
so I'll try to do it in like a couple 
sentences.

486
00:29:18,141 --> 00:29:19,240
Yeah.
Um,

487
00:29:21,020 --> 00:29:25,420
uh,
so,

488
00:29:25,780 --> 00:29:28,150
so how does it,
how does an infant learn anything?

489
00:29:28,740 --> 00:29:30,600
So an infant's born

490
00:29:32,360 --> 00:29:34,490
and it can't really do anything for 
itself.

491
00:29:35,300 --> 00:29:37,520
It can't regulate its own nervous 
system.

492
00:29:37,640 --> 00:29:42,640
It can't keep its body systems balanced.
This is a term scientific term for this 

493
00:29:42,781 --> 00:29:47,781
is allo stasis.
Allostasis is your brain's ability to 

494
00:29:47,781 --> 00:29:51,001
predict what your body's going to need 
before it needs it and tries to meet 

495
00:29:51,001 --> 00:29:54,991
those needs before they arise.
So an example would be if you're going 

496
00:29:54,991 --> 00:29:57,010
to stand up,
if your brain's gonna stand you up,

497
00:29:57,011 --> 00:29:59,650
it has to raise your blood pressure 
before it stands you up.

498
00:30:00,280 --> 00:30:02,230
If it doesn't,
you'll fall.

499
00:30:02,320 --> 00:30:05,140
That's costly.
From metabolic standpoint,

500
00:30:05,170 --> 00:30:07,120
it's costly,
you'll hurt yourself.

501
00:30:08,200 --> 00:30:12,130
So an infant's brain can't do this very 
well.

502
00:30:13,570 --> 00:30:18,570
An infant doesn't know when to go to 
sleep and when to wake up and infant 

503
00:30:18,570 --> 00:30:19,870
doesn't,
can't feed itself,

504
00:30:19,871 --> 00:30:23,590
can't regulate its own temperature,
someone else has to do it.

505
00:30:24,340 --> 00:30:28,360
And when someone does it,
the infant is learning,

506
00:30:28,860 --> 00:30:33,860
the infant is learning,
it's taking insights and sounds and 

507
00:30:34,241 --> 00:30:39,241
smells and the physical sensations from 
the body which are comfortable and 

508
00:30:41,291 --> 00:30:42,070
pleasant.

509
00:30:42,310 --> 00:30:45,910
When the infant allo stasis is 
maintained.

510
00:30:47,410 --> 00:30:52,410
So right from the Gecko,
an infant is learning statistical 

511
00:30:53,651 --> 00:30:55,300
learning.
Um,

512
00:30:55,870 --> 00:30:58,720
you know,
the capturing events,

513
00:30:59,020 --> 00:31:02,020
including their consequence for the 
infant's body.

514
00:31:02,140 --> 00:31:04,090
Some people think babies are born,
you know,

515
00:31:04,120 --> 00:31:07,480
attached already to their caregivers,
but they're not actually.

516
00:31:08,410 --> 00:31:10,690
Infants don't even know what a caregiver
is.

517
00:31:10,780 --> 00:31:14,230
It's just that the caregiver is,
they're constantly meeting that infant's

518
00:31:14,231 --> 00:31:17,020
needs.
That's how infant start to learn.

519
00:31:17,200 --> 00:31:19,780
Now,
if there are statistical regularities,

520
00:31:19,781 --> 00:31:24,781
like for example,
an infant is not born with the ability 

521
00:31:24,781 --> 00:31:27,691
to recognize a face as a face,
but it learns that in like the first 

522
00:31:27,691 --> 00:31:28,930
couple of days of life.
Why?

523
00:31:29,020 --> 00:31:32,350
Because human faces have some 
statistical regularities to them,

524
00:31:32,800 --> 00:31:33,820
right?
Two eyes,

525
00:31:33,821 --> 00:31:37,300
a nose and a mouth kind of in the same 
place most of the time.

526
00:31:38,260 --> 00:31:42,430
So it learns really quickly.
But here's the interesting thing,

527
00:31:42,490 --> 00:31:47,490
around three months of age,
infants start to learn what we call 

528
00:31:49,030 --> 00:31:50,980
abstract categories.

529
00:31:51,040 --> 00:31:56,040
They start to learn that some things 
which don't look the same or sound the 

530
00:31:56,040 --> 00:32:00,991
same or smell the same,
actually have the same function.

531
00:32:02,950 --> 00:32:05,860
And how do they learn this?
They learn it with words.

532
00:32:06,850 --> 00:32:09,580
So if you do an experiment with a three 
month old,

533
00:32:09,820 --> 00:32:11,440
three months old,
okay?

534
00:32:11,680 --> 00:32:14,770
And you say that baby very,
very intentionally.

535
00:32:14,950 --> 00:32:19,950
Look Sweetie,
this is a bug and you put the dog down 

536
00:32:22,180 --> 00:32:25,210
and it makes a noise,
like a beep.

537
00:32:26,470 --> 00:32:28,570
And then you say,
I'm like,

538
00:32:28,571 --> 00:32:32,000
I don't have props.
And then you have my wallet.

539
00:32:32,230 --> 00:32:32,710
Yeah.
Okay.

540
00:32:32,711 --> 00:32:33,880
And then you say,
give me your wallet.

541
00:32:34,040 --> 00:32:34,900
Yeah,
give me your wallet.

542
00:32:36,610 --> 00:32:40,160
And then you say,
look sweetie,

543
00:32:40,250 --> 00:32:44,990
this is a watch dog,
and you put the walk down and it makes a

544
00:32:44,991 --> 00:32:47,480
beep.
If you say,

545
00:32:47,840 --> 00:32:52,840
look sweetie,
this is a watchdog that infant expects 

546
00:32:54,950 --> 00:32:58,460
that object to beep.
Why is that important?

547
00:32:58,730 --> 00:33:03,730
Because in the real experiments,
this might be yellow and squishy and I'm

548
00:33:05,840 --> 00:33:10,840
tall and this might be red and pointy 
and you know,

549
00:33:11,541 --> 00:33:13,430
hard.
And this might be,

550
00:33:13,460 --> 00:33:18,460
you know,
so lots of different perceptual 

551
00:33:18,460 --> 00:33:18,460
features.
But,

552
00:33:18,460 --> 00:33:22,840
um,
but the infant knows a learns that the 

553
00:33:24,561 --> 00:33:29,561
word is inviting the infant to 
understand that the function of those 

554
00:33:30,981 --> 00:33:35,060
very different physical signals are 
actually the same.

555
00:33:35,180 --> 00:33:36,710
Similarly,
you can take,

556
00:33:36,980 --> 00:33:41,980
you know,
six objects that are exactly identical 

557
00:33:41,980 --> 00:33:42,590
in their physical features,
how they sound,

558
00:33:42,591 --> 00:33:45,140
how they smell,
what they feel like,

559
00:33:45,460 --> 00:33:46,910
um,
what they look like.

560
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:52,000
And you can name three of them with one 
word and three of them with the other 

561
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:53,870
word.
And the infant will understand that,

562
00:33:53,871 --> 00:33:58,871
um,
these are actually different objects 

563
00:33:58,871 --> 00:33:58,871
that happens a little after,
you know,

564
00:33:58,871 --> 00:33:59,030
not,
not as early as three months.

565
00:33:59,300 --> 00:34:02,600
But the point is that when we talk all 
the time,

566
00:34:02,601 --> 00:34:03,710
we use words all the time.

567
00:34:03,710 --> 00:34:06,740
What do we do with infants?
We're constantly pointing things out and

568
00:34:06,741 --> 00:34:08,630
labeling them.
This is a dog,

569
00:34:08,660 --> 00:34:10,880
this is a cat.
You're angry.

570
00:34:10,910 --> 00:34:12,740
This person sad.
Oh,

571
00:34:12,741 --> 00:34:14,960
Mommy's really happy today.
Oh,

572
00:34:14,961 --> 00:34:16,460
you know,
mommy loves you.

573
00:34:16,670 --> 00:34:19,550
Oh,
daddy's really excited about this.

574
00:34:19,640 --> 00:34:23,600
And so on and so forth.
And infants learn really,

575
00:34:23,601 --> 00:34:28,601
really quickly.
Words are considered to be kind of 

576
00:34:28,601 --> 00:34:31,361
invitations to form abstract concepts.
That is the basis of almost all of the,

577
00:34:34,220 --> 00:34:36,050
um,
uh,

578
00:34:36,440 --> 00:34:40,130
you know,
mental categories that we,

579
00:34:40,160 --> 00:34:41,310
uh,
that,

580
00:34:41,680 --> 00:34:46,680
that we,
mental events that we experienced were 

581
00:34:46,680 --> 00:34:48,560
basically teaching children to form 
these abstract categories,

582
00:34:48,561 --> 00:34:53,561
not,
and that's the basis of money and it's 

583
00:34:53,561 --> 00:34:54,050
the basis of,
um,

584
00:34:54,200 --> 00:34:58,250
roles that we have with each other and 
what we expect from each other.

585
00:34:58,251 --> 00:35:03,251
It's the basis of a lot of the sort of 
functional categories that we use in 

586
00:35:03,251 --> 00:35:04,350
everyday life.
We impose meaning on sensory,

587
00:35:04,630 --> 00:35:09,630
on sensory arrays that those sensory 
raised in and of themselves don't 

588
00:35:09,630 --> 00:35:13,961
necessarily have.
They only have that meaning because you 

589
00:35:13,961 --> 00:35:16,820
and I both learned that that package of 
sensory rate means something,

590
00:35:16,821 --> 00:35:21,821
so when I make that you can anticipate 
what will happen next just because we've

591
00:35:22,131 --> 00:35:26,920
learned those are wired into our brains,
you know,

592
00:35:26,930 --> 00:35:29,360
in our culture and when we go to a 
different culture,

593
00:35:29,361 --> 00:35:32,480
we have to learn sometimes different 
packages,

594
00:35:33,440 --> 00:35:38,440
different mappings.
So you're saying that there's a few 

595
00:35:38,440 --> 00:35:38,440
sources of sensory data

596
00:35:38,440 --> 00:35:43,040
and a few building blocks inside us,
the feelings of some kind that we 

597
00:35:43,411 --> 00:35:47,070
learned to then from an early they were 
combined with those,

598
00:35:47,320 --> 00:35:47,630
or

599
00:35:47,800 --> 00:35:52,800
part of what your brain is doing is it's
trying to make sense of the sensory 

600
00:35:52,800 --> 00:35:55,530
array around it.
So from your brain's person.

601
00:35:55,750 --> 00:36:00,750
So from your brain's perspective,
just think about it from your brain's 

602
00:36:00,750 --> 00:36:02,340
perspective,
your brain's perspective.

603
00:36:03,180 --> 00:36:07,410
It spends it's entire life trapped in a 
dark,

604
00:36:07,411 --> 00:36:12,411
silent box and it has to make sense of 
what's going on around in the world.

605
00:36:16,971 --> 00:36:20,240
So that knows what to do to keep itself 
alive,

606
00:36:20,300 --> 00:36:24,470
right and well,
but it has to.

607
00:36:25,290 --> 00:36:28,110
It has to know what to do based on,
it has to know what,

608
00:36:28,170 --> 00:36:33,170
what's happening on around it,
only from the effects that it receives 

609
00:36:33,170 --> 00:36:37,700
through the sensory systems of the body.
So a flash of light.

610
00:36:38,190 --> 00:36:39,990
What's a flash of light?
It could be anything.

611
00:36:40,710 --> 00:36:41,550
Um,
what,

612
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:43,950
what's a like a,
like a siren.

613
00:36:43,951 --> 00:36:45,600
The siren could be,
you know,

614
00:36:45,601 --> 00:36:50,601
a firetruck or it could be um,
somebody's car alarm went off or it 

615
00:36:50,671 --> 00:36:52,640
could be a doorbell or it could be 
right.

616
00:36:52,750 --> 00:36:57,090
Any particular sensory cue could have 
multiple causes.

617
00:36:57,350 --> 00:36:59,970
So your brain's trapped basically in 
your skull.

618
00:37:00,060 --> 00:37:05,060
And all it gets are the effects,
the sensory effects of stuff that 

619
00:37:05,361 --> 00:37:10,361
happens in the world,
but it has to figure out what those 

620
00:37:10,361 --> 00:37:11,840
things are so that it knows what to do.
So how does it do that?

621
00:37:12,140 --> 00:37:17,140
Well,
it has something else that it can draw 

622
00:37:17,140 --> 00:37:17,140
on.
It has your past experiences.

623
00:37:17,140 --> 00:37:21,400
Your brain basically is,
it doesn't store experiences from the 

624
00:37:21,631 --> 00:37:24,810
past.
It can reconstitute them in its wiring.

625
00:37:26,840 --> 00:37:31,840
And that's what it uses to guess at what
those sensory cues mean of those sensory

626
00:37:33,861 --> 00:37:37,160
changes meet.
So in one situation,

627
00:37:38,390 --> 00:37:40,730
a siren means one thing,
in another situation,

628
00:37:40,731 --> 00:37:45,731
it means another,
a flash of light means one thing in one 

629
00:37:45,731 --> 00:37:45,731
situation and a different thing and 
another.

630
00:37:45,731 --> 00:37:50,010
So your brain is using past experience 
to make guesses about what these sensory

631
00:37:50,240 --> 00:37:54,140
changes mean so that it knows what to do
and it,

632
00:37:54,220 --> 00:37:57,800
it has the same relationship to the 
sensory changes in your body.

633
00:37:57,950 --> 00:38:01,330
What's an ache in your stomach?
Well,

634
00:38:01,750 --> 00:38:04,990
it could be hunger,
it could be anger,

635
00:38:05,230 --> 00:38:07,150
it could be discussed,
it could be longing,

636
00:38:07,720 --> 00:38:12,350
it can be nausea.
It's not that there's one,

637
00:38:12,670 --> 00:38:17,670
um,
ache in your stomach for nausea and 

638
00:38:17,670 --> 00:38:17,670
another ache in your stomach for hunger.

639
00:38:19,730 --> 00:38:24,260
There are many aches and your stomach,
benny different feelings of achiness for

640
00:38:24,261 --> 00:38:26,960
nausea and many different feelings of 
achiness for hunger.

641
00:38:26,961 --> 00:38:30,920
And sometimes they overlap.
So your brain has to make the same kinds

642
00:38:30,921 --> 00:38:35,921
of guesses about what's going on in your
body as it does about what the sensory 

643
00:38:35,921 --> 00:38:37,360
events meet in the world.
And that's really what it's doing.

644
00:38:37,370 --> 00:38:42,370
It's guessing and making sense of the 
sensory ray so that it knows what to do 

645
00:38:42,370 --> 00:38:44,290
next.
And when it guesses wrong,

646
00:38:44,470 --> 00:38:46,720
it takes in that the,
you know,

647
00:38:46,721 --> 00:38:47,650
the,
the sort of,

648
00:38:47,651 --> 00:38:52,651
um,
the information that it didn't predict 

649
00:38:52,651 --> 00:38:52,651
well,
um,

650
00:38:52,651 --> 00:38:52,990
which,
you know,

651
00:38:53,050 --> 00:38:55,870
in psychology we have a really fancy 
name for that.

652
00:38:56,060 --> 00:39:01,060
We call it learning your brain takes in 
the information that it didn't predict,

653
00:39:01,560 --> 00:39:06,560
um,
so that it can predict better than the 

654
00:39:06,560 --> 00:39:06,560
next time to make sense of things the 
next time.

655
00:39:07,700 --> 00:39:11,540
So you kind of answered this a little 
bit.

656
00:39:11,700 --> 00:39:16,700
I'd like to elaborate on it.
If you were to build a robot that 

657
00:39:16,700 --> 00:39:18,890
performs,
maybe passes the turing test or performs

658
00:39:19,100 --> 00:39:23,290
at the low bar level of instead of 
myself here today,

659
00:39:23,291 --> 00:39:26,560
it will be a robot talking to you.
It would be convincing as a human,

660
00:39:26,830 --> 00:39:29,890
how would you,
what kind of,

661
00:39:30,770 --> 00:39:32,720
how would you build that system in a 
sense?

662
00:39:33,130 --> 00:39:38,130
I'm in paralleling the infants.
What essential aspect of the infant 

663
00:39:38,180 --> 00:39:40,670
experience do you think is important?

664
00:39:42,160 --> 00:39:42,990
Well,
I mean,

665
00:39:43,350 --> 00:39:44,210
you know,
I don't,

666
00:39:44,270 --> 00:39:46,730
I'm not a computer scientist so,
uh,

667
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:52,000
but,
so the way that I would say it is it 

668
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:54,611
needs to have a body.
These have something like physical 

669
00:39:54,611 --> 00:39:55,690
systems or an analogy to physical 
systems.

670
00:39:55,960 --> 00:39:57,760
It has to do something analogous to 
Alice.

671
00:39:57,800 --> 00:39:58,970
Dcis.
So

672
00:39:59,400 --> 00:40:04,400
what side to elaborate.
So what would be the goal for the 

673
00:40:04,400 --> 00:40:08,471
system?
You kind of mentioned previously that 

674
00:40:08,471 --> 00:40:09,560
the goal will be to,
for the brain to just stabilize itself.

675
00:40:09,730 --> 00:40:14,730
No,
it's not that the brain is stabilized 

676
00:40:14,730 --> 00:40:14,730
now you have.
So people talk about reward.

677
00:40:14,730 --> 00:40:14,730
What does reward?

678
00:40:15,840 --> 00:40:20,840
Machine learning is pretty easy.
It's something that it's mathematical.

679
00:40:22,891 --> 00:40:25,290
So it's a,
there's no philosophy to it.

680
00:40:26,140 --> 00:40:27,830
Oh yeah.
There's philosophy that everything,

681
00:40:28,170 --> 00:40:33,170
right?
Whether you admit it or not as a 

682
00:40:33,170 --> 00:40:33,170
different story.
Yeah.

683
00:40:33,170 --> 00:40:33,170
So,
uh,

684
00:40:33,170 --> 00:40:35,800
you wanted to play a game of chess play 
given go,

685
00:40:35,801 --> 00:40:40,801
you want to pick up a water bottle is.
But what is reward existence?

686
00:40:43,990 --> 00:40:44,010
I

687
00:40:47,330 --> 00:40:50,390
don't mean it's actually not reward.
Don't meet as effort,

688
00:40:50,510 --> 00:40:53,660
don't meet as necessary for effort.
It's not necessarily for word.

689
00:40:53,860 --> 00:40:57,370
I mean it's commonly if you read the 
most,

690
00:40:57,710 --> 00:41:02,710
those uptodate literature,
that is what you'll see that it's 

691
00:41:02,710 --> 00:41:05,600
actually people can,
animals can find things rewarding,

692
00:41:06,010 --> 00:41:07,760
um,
can be without,

693
00:41:07,761 --> 00:41:09,740
um,
without domain actually.

694
00:41:09,741 --> 00:41:10,760
But they,
uh,

695
00:41:10,890 --> 00:41:12,650
they,
they need to open me to move,

696
00:41:13,400 --> 00:41:16,190
they need job mean to encode that to,
to learn information.

697
00:41:16,191 --> 00:41:19,250
So it's really for an effort that is 
required to,

698
00:41:19,490 --> 00:41:21,470
um,
work towards getting a reward,

699
00:41:21,560 --> 00:41:23,470
I would say.
And um,

700
00:41:23,930 --> 00:41:25,820
uh,
when the,

701
00:41:25,880 --> 00:41:28,190
when a brain and animal brand a human,
you know,

702
00:41:28,490 --> 00:41:32,480
any kind of animal brain,
Ms Dot predicts what the reward will be.

703
00:41:32,660 --> 00:41:37,660
That's where see a real surge of 
dopamine because the animal has to 

704
00:41:37,660 --> 00:41:42,071
adjust its action.
But the reward is basically I'm bringing

705
00:41:43,700 --> 00:41:45,560
the body back into Alice Asis.

706
00:41:46,100 --> 00:41:49,430
It feels good when that happens and 
people will,

707
00:41:49,500 --> 00:41:54,500
an animals will work tremendously hard 
to have that happen.

708
00:41:55,800 --> 00:41:57,550
So,
you know,

709
00:41:57,551 --> 00:41:59,950
what is motivation?
Motivation is,

710
00:42:00,310 --> 00:42:05,310
is expanding resources to get a reward.
So basically if,

711
00:42:09,120 --> 00:42:14,120
if you don't have something like 
physical systems that have to be kept in

712
00:42:17,561 --> 00:42:22,561
balance,
water mean for humans or for actually 

713
00:42:22,561 --> 00:42:26,631
any living creature on this planet,
even single cell organisms.

714
00:42:29,591 --> 00:42:32,140
Actually there's an analogy to what 
we're talking about here.

715
00:42:32,590 --> 00:42:33,670
Two,
two brains.

716
00:42:34,030 --> 00:42:35,890
But you know,
Salt,

717
00:42:36,460 --> 00:42:38,110
water,
glucose,

718
00:42:38,320 --> 00:42:43,320
all these systems have to be kept in 
balance and they have to be kept in 

719
00:42:43,320 --> 00:42:44,830
balance in a very,
very efficient way.

720
00:42:46,240 --> 00:42:49,450
And that's the motivating so-called 
motivating force.

721
00:42:49,451 --> 00:42:52,090
Really that's what,
that's what,

722
00:42:52,120 --> 00:42:53,740
that's what really brains are for.
So.

723
00:42:55,230 --> 00:43:00,230
And that is the basis,
the consequence of that regulation are 

724
00:43:00,230 --> 00:43:05,211
the basis of effective feelings which 
are for many,

725
00:43:05,701 --> 00:43:09,840
many creatures on this planet.
A property of consciousness.

726
00:43:11,040 --> 00:43:13,980
Okay.
So maybe if it's okay,

727
00:43:13,981 --> 00:43:15,600
we'll take some questions from the 
audience.

728
00:43:15,800 --> 00:43:18,110
But first,
let me ask the last question is.

729
00:43:18,360 --> 00:43:23,360
So on building on the robot question,
how would you build the same kind of 

730
00:43:24,121 --> 00:43:28,860
robot that you would be able to as a 
human being fallen in love with?

731
00:43:31,550 --> 00:43:32,180
Well,
you know,

732
00:43:32,181 --> 00:43:36,220
people fall in love with their cars.
They fall in love with.

733
00:43:37,810 --> 00:43:41,680
They fall in love with their blankets.
They fall in love with their toys,

734
00:43:42,340 --> 00:43:43,270
you know,
you don't need.

735
00:43:43,390 --> 00:43:48,390
It.
Doesn't need much to fall in love with 

736
00:43:48,390 --> 00:43:48,390
something.
The question is,

737
00:43:48,390 --> 00:43:48,390
will it love you back

738
00:43:50,860 --> 00:43:54,190
I w I would elaborate.
I think so,

739
00:43:54,900 --> 00:43:59,900
yeah.
I think you're answering that love in 

740
00:43:59,900 --> 00:44:00,450
the way we're defining it loosely in 
poetry and culture is a,

741
00:44:00,490 --> 00:44:05,490
is a social construct and it's relative.
What I mean is sort of the idea of 

742
00:44:05,721 --> 00:44:10,721
monogamous,
long term love that we have deep 

743
00:44:10,721 --> 00:44:11,390
connection with other human beings that 
we have.

744
00:44:11,420 --> 00:44:14,820
You're saying you could do the same with
a car like a nice 69 Mustang.

745
00:44:14,940 --> 00:44:16,230
Are you telling me that you,
you,

746
00:44:16,270 --> 00:44:19,260
you're telling me that you've never,
you don't know anyone who was so in love

747
00:44:19,261 --> 00:44:20,550
with their car that you.
Okay.

748
00:44:20,880 --> 00:44:22,460
Now here's the thing.
So one.

749
00:44:22,720 --> 00:44:24,090
So here's the thing,
we,

750
00:44:24,091 --> 00:44:25,950
um,
we are social animals.

751
00:44:25,951 --> 00:44:27,420
Okay.
What does that mean?

752
00:44:27,450 --> 00:44:32,450
What does it mean to be a social animal?
It means that we regulate each other's 

753
00:44:32,450 --> 00:44:32,450
nervous.
So our brain,

754
00:44:32,450 --> 00:44:36,150
my brain isn't just regulating my 
nervous system right now.

755
00:44:36,240 --> 00:44:39,930
It's regulating yours and actually it's 
regulating other,

756
00:44:39,990 --> 00:44:42,450
other peoples in the audience too.
And vice versa.

757
00:44:42,630 --> 00:44:44,130
And why is that?
You know,

758
00:44:44,131 --> 00:44:46,590
I mean,
other animals do it too.

759
00:44:46,740 --> 00:44:49,620
We're just really good at it.
But other animals,

760
00:44:49,621 --> 00:44:52,500
like there are some insects that are 
social species.

761
00:44:52,501 --> 00:44:54,150
They regulate each other's nervous 
systems,

762
00:44:54,151 --> 00:44:59,151
they do it with chemicals,
they do it with smell primarily and a 

763
00:44:59,151 --> 00:45:00,300
little bit with touch like earwigs will,
you know,

764
00:45:00,360 --> 00:45:05,360
like they could actually,
I have this great picture of this like 

765
00:45:05,360 --> 00:45:05,790
totally disgusting looking little bug,
but it's like,

766
00:45:06,260 --> 00:45:07,170
you know,
cuddling.

767
00:45:07,170 --> 00:45:10,180
It's little baby,
ugly little ugly baby bug too.

768
00:45:10,820 --> 00:45:12,860
It's adorable picture.
Um,

769
00:45:12,930 --> 00:45:15,450
but you know,
what about mammals like rats?

770
00:45:15,451 --> 00:45:18,240
Well,
they also use chemicals like smell,

771
00:45:18,390 --> 00:45:22,470
but they also use touch and to some 
extent,

772
00:45:22,900 --> 00:45:24,510
um,
they also use sound.

773
00:45:24,540 --> 00:45:29,540
These hearing primates add vision.
And as primates we do all,

774
00:45:30,331 --> 00:45:32,970
we use all of those senses to regulate 
each other.

775
00:45:33,150 --> 00:45:37,530
And we also use something else words,
right?

776
00:45:37,531 --> 00:45:39,390
Exactly.
And words.

777
00:45:39,450 --> 00:45:44,450
The systems in our brains that allow us 
to speak and allow us to understand 

778
00:45:44,450 --> 00:45:49,401
words are directly connected to the 
parts of the brain stem that controls 

779
00:45:51,031 --> 00:45:53,010
the body.
I don't mean like there are a bunch of,

780
00:45:53,011 --> 00:45:54,930
I mean,
I mean Monta synaptic,

781
00:45:54,931 --> 00:45:59,931
[inaudible] connected.
So exactly the same systems in your 

782
00:45:59,931 --> 00:46:03,501
brain that are important for you to be 
able to understand language and to speak

783
00:46:05,460 --> 00:46:10,460
are also directly directly affecting the
systems of your body.

784
00:46:11,880 --> 00:46:16,880
And that is why I can say something to 
somebody I can speak to you and I can 

785
00:46:17,431 --> 00:46:22,431
have an impact on the nervous systems of
people all the way at the back of this 

786
00:46:22,431 --> 00:46:23,880
auditorium without they,
you know,

787
00:46:23,940 --> 00:46:25,650
maybe they can see me.
Maybe they can't.

788
00:46:25,830 --> 00:46:27,840
Maybe they can.
Hopefully they can smell me.

789
00:46:28,020 --> 00:46:30,780
Maybe they can hear me.
Maybe they know that they can,

790
00:46:30,781 --> 00:46:33,240
if they hear me speak words,
I can affect their nervous systems.

791
00:46:33,900 --> 00:46:37,500
That's why telephone works.
That's why telephone works where you can

792
00:46:37,501 --> 00:46:40,650
feel connected to someone just merely by
hearing their voice,

793
00:46:41,100 --> 00:46:46,100
um,
because the sound of their voice has an 

794
00:46:46,100 --> 00:46:46,100
effect on your nervous system.
It can,

795
00:46:46,100 --> 00:46:48,180
it can make you breathe faster,
it can make you breathe slower.

796
00:46:48,330 --> 00:46:53,330
And the words also have an effect.
Because when I say a word like,

797
00:46:54,700 --> 00:46:56,670
mm,
I dunno.

798
00:46:57,300 --> 00:47:00,840
Um,
when I say word like car,

799
00:47:01,770 --> 00:47:03,120
that's a short form.

800
00:47:04,200 --> 00:47:08,400
I have a bunch of mental features in my 
mind when I say the word car,

801
00:47:08,490 --> 00:47:12,420
and I say that word and that invokes 
those similar mental features,

802
00:47:12,421 --> 00:47:17,421
maybe not identical,
but similar enough that invokes it in 

803
00:47:17,421 --> 00:47:20,991
your mind and your mind is made by your 
brain.

804
00:47:22,950 --> 00:47:26,190
So it invokes,
if I just say the word car,

805
00:47:26,970 --> 00:47:31,970
there are changes in your motor system 
that would be exactly the same or very 

806
00:47:33,011 --> 00:47:36,690
close as if you were actually in a car,
right?

807
00:47:36,990 --> 00:47:41,990
So this is something that we do and the 
fact we're attachment comes from an 

808
00:47:46,301 --> 00:47:51,301
infant to a caregiver or um,
or two lovers or two really close 

809
00:47:51,851 --> 00:47:56,851
friends comes from the ability that we 
have to regulate each other's nervous 

810
00:47:57,001 --> 00:47:57,600
systems.

811
00:48:00,110 --> 00:48:02,980
And that is why,
um,

812
00:48:04,080 --> 00:48:06,140
when you don't have that kind of 
attachment,

813
00:48:06,910 --> 00:48:11,910
uh,
you die sooner on average seven years 

814
00:48:11,910 --> 00:48:13,210
sooner.
Loneliness kills.

815
00:48:13,211 --> 00:48:18,211
I always tell my daughter,
my daughter's 19 years old and I always 

816
00:48:18,211 --> 00:48:18,211
tell her,
you know,

817
00:48:18,211 --> 00:48:18,211
breaking up,
when you break up with someone,

818
00:48:18,211 --> 00:48:21,550
it feels like it will kill you,
but it won't.

819
00:48:22,100 --> 00:48:27,100
Loneliness however will kill you.
It will kill you on average seven years 

820
00:48:29,841 --> 00:48:34,070
earlier than it would if you didn't have
a an attachment,

821
00:48:34,820 --> 00:48:39,820
and that's because our nervous systems,
as our bodies got really complex through

822
00:48:42,441 --> 00:48:46,830
evolution and our brains got bigger,
they could only get so big.

823
00:48:48,870 --> 00:48:53,870
There are constraints on how big any 
brain can get that have to do with 

824
00:48:53,870 --> 00:48:56,610
birthing the infant,
but it also has to do with the metabolic

825
00:48:56,611 --> 00:49:00,330
cost of a brain.
Your brain is really expensive.

826
00:49:00,360 --> 00:49:03,330
My brain really expensive.
Three pounds,

827
00:49:03,740 --> 00:49:06,980
20 percent of your metabolic budget.
That's a lot.

828
00:49:07,130 --> 00:49:12,130
Okay,
and so what did evolution do to solve 

829
00:49:12,130 --> 00:49:13,360
this problem?
Well,

830
00:49:13,570 --> 00:49:18,570
it couldn't make our brains any bigger,
so it just in trained other brains to 

831
00:49:18,570 --> 00:49:22,951
help manage our nervous systems so you 
bear the burden of other peoples' alice 

832
00:49:23,830 --> 00:49:28,600
basis and they bear the burden of yours.
Not always at the same time,

833
00:49:28,750 --> 00:49:30,760
but that's what it means to give people 
support.

834
00:49:31,340 --> 00:49:36,340
When someone,
when you're feeling horrible and 

835
00:49:36,340 --> 00:49:37,190
somebody pats you on the back or says 
nice words to you or gives you a hug,

836
00:49:37,370 --> 00:49:42,370
they are physically having an effect on 
your body that they are helping your 

837
00:49:42,410 --> 00:49:46,790
body to maintain aloe status at a time 
when your brain probably couldn't manage

838
00:49:46,791 --> 00:49:51,791
it on its own.
And so the basis of love or attachment 

839
00:49:51,791 --> 00:49:56,200
is,
is basically that it's the ability to 

840
00:49:56,200 --> 00:49:57,230
affect each other's nervous systems in a
positive way.

841
00:49:57,380 --> 00:49:59,840
Like always say to people,
you know,

842
00:49:59,841 --> 00:50:04,280
the best thing for nervous system,
a human nervous system is another human.

843
00:50:05,360 --> 00:50:10,360
And the worst thing for a human nervous 
system is another human.

844
00:50:13,910 --> 00:50:15,170
Because we're social animals.

845
00:50:17,010 --> 00:50:22,010
Beautifully put.
So maybe a few questions in the 

846
00:50:22,010 --> 00:50:22,010
audience.
Do you mind if there's,

847
00:50:22,010 --> 00:50:23,460
there's microphones on both sides.
Go ahead.

848
00:50:23,700 --> 00:50:28,130
Sure.
Thanks for talking

849
00:50:28,190 --> 00:50:30,050
here.
You're saying cool stuff,

850
00:50:31,970 --> 00:50:36,970
not a question.
I'll take it.

851
00:50:41,310 --> 00:50:43,650
So thinking about what you were saying 
about reward,

852
00:50:43,651 --> 00:50:48,651
and I'm wondering first of all,
is he described it as a returned to 

853
00:50:49,381 --> 00:50:54,381
Alice.
Asis is reward in any way linked to the.

854
00:50:56,180 --> 00:51:00,660
I just like the reinforcement of 
pathways or behavior.

855
00:51:00,661 --> 00:51:02,490
So that the next time you get that 
stimulus,

856
00:51:03,270 --> 00:51:05,520
you will,
you'll respond in the same way.

857
00:51:06,390 --> 00:51:08,620
And I'm also wondering about,
uh,

858
00:51:08,640 --> 00:51:12,230
the link between the desire for Elo 
spaces

859
00:51:12,890 --> 00:51:17,180
and the need for novelty and then need 
to like explore our environment.

860
00:51:17,390 --> 00:51:22,390
It's a really great question.
So the second question is so much more 

861
00:51:22,881 --> 00:51:26,270
interesting than the first actually.
So let me say this,

862
00:51:26,271 --> 00:51:27,320
that,
um,

863
00:51:28,490 --> 00:51:31,340
that uh,
there is a need for novelty.

864
00:51:31,820 --> 00:51:35,600
The need differs,
fried for different people.

865
00:51:35,660 --> 00:51:38,300
I will say novelty.
Um,

866
00:51:38,390 --> 00:51:40,560
so first of all,
uh,

867
00:51:42,160 --> 00:51:47,160
the,
we can think about the need for novelty 

868
00:51:47,160 --> 00:51:50,951
in a really proximal way where we can 
think about it in a really distilled way

869
00:51:51,580 --> 00:51:56,580
like,
but basically when I say that a brain is

870
00:51:58,141 --> 00:52:01,770
organized or,
or engineered for metabolic efficiency,

871
00:52:01,771 --> 00:52:06,771
that doesn't mean that the goal is to,
to only ever have your prediction.

872
00:52:08,810 --> 00:52:10,520
You know,
your brain is predicting all the time to

873
00:52:10,521 --> 00:52:12,860
always have its predictions completely 
perfect.

874
00:52:12,861 --> 00:52:16,160
So you'll never learn nothing because 
you'll be bored out of your mind.

875
00:52:16,190 --> 00:52:18,530
Right?
And also,

876
00:52:19,580 --> 00:52:23,570
you know,
humans like to expand their niche,

877
00:52:23,571 --> 00:52:25,100
they like to explore.

878
00:52:25,370 --> 00:52:30,370
So it's a constant balance between what 
I'm biologists would call exploitation 

879
00:52:31,580 --> 00:52:35,420
and exploration.
Novelty is,

880
00:52:35,600 --> 00:52:36,200
is,
um,

881
00:52:36,620 --> 00:52:41,620
it's exciting.
There's actually an increase in 

882
00:52:41,620 --> 00:52:42,980
norepinephrine and increase in arousal.
It feels really exciting.

883
00:52:43,440 --> 00:52:46,280
Um,
but it's also super costly.

884
00:52:46,580 --> 00:52:51,580
Novelty requires usually that you learn 
something new that means that's actually

885
00:52:52,971 --> 00:52:54,890
really metabolically expensive thing to 
do.

886
00:52:55,350 --> 00:53:00,350
Um,
and it also means usually that you're 

887
00:53:00,350 --> 00:53:02,411
moving your body around,
which is also metabolically expensive 

888
00:53:02,411 --> 00:53:05,381
thing to do.
So the need for novelty is balanced by 

889
00:53:05,381 --> 00:53:07,310
its cost.
And um,

890
00:53:07,910 --> 00:53:12,530
different nervous systems can bear ca 
different amounts of cost.

891
00:53:12,680 --> 00:53:17,680
So for example,
if you take two rats that are somewhat 

892
00:53:18,051 --> 00:53:19,020
genetically,
you know,

893
00:53:19,090 --> 00:53:21,110
model like they've been genetically 
bred,

894
00:53:21,350 --> 00:53:23,680
one is bread.
When you stick it in a,

895
00:53:25,560 --> 00:53:28,530
a novel cage,
it just sits still.

896
00:53:29,730 --> 00:53:31,980
And the other one,
when you put it in all the cage,

897
00:53:32,050 --> 00:53:34,560
it roams all over the place and it's 
just,

898
00:53:34,590 --> 00:53:39,590
you know,
it's going crazy kind of exploring 

899
00:53:39,590 --> 00:53:39,590
everything.

900
00:53:39,590 --> 00:53:39,590
Well,
the one that sits still,

901
00:53:39,590 --> 00:53:40,320
scientists might say,
oh,

902
00:53:40,321 --> 00:53:43,800
that's a nervous rat or that rats 
afraid.

903
00:53:44,040 --> 00:53:49,040
What does that read doing?
The Ra is not moving and it's not 

904
00:53:49,040 --> 00:53:50,690
encoding anything because encoding,
coding something is expensive,

905
00:53:50,691 --> 00:53:55,691
it's expensive.
This rat on the other hand is roaming 

906
00:53:56,221 --> 00:53:58,140
all over the place,
moving a lot,

907
00:53:58,170 --> 00:54:00,300
learning a lot,
so it's encoding a lot,

908
00:54:00,301 --> 00:54:01,170
spend,
spend,

909
00:54:01,171 --> 00:54:02,280
spend,
save,

910
00:54:02,281 --> 00:54:03,030
save,
save,

911
00:54:03,031 --> 00:54:03,750
spend,
spend,

912
00:54:03,751 --> 00:54:07,350
spend their time.
There are differences between people and

913
00:54:07,351 --> 00:54:12,351
there are also differences between times
in your life where moments where you 

914
00:54:12,351 --> 00:54:15,471
feel like you have a little bit to spend
and other moments where you feel like 

915
00:54:15,471 --> 00:54:15,720
you really have to conserve.
When I talked to the public,

916
00:54:15,721 --> 00:54:17,740
I always talk about,
I don't use the word Alice status,

917
00:54:17,760 --> 00:54:22,760
it's just too boring a word,
but I sort of do is sort of explain it 

918
00:54:22,760 --> 00:54:23,070
like a budget.

919
00:54:23,100 --> 00:54:28,100
You know,
like your brain is sort of like the 

920
00:54:28,100 --> 00:54:29,790
financial office of accompany.
Accompany has lots of offices.

921
00:54:29,791 --> 00:54:34,020
It has to balance the expenditures and 
revenues and it's got to keep everything

922
00:54:34,021 --> 00:54:39,021
in balance so it might take a little 
money here and move it over to that 

923
00:54:39,021 --> 00:54:39,021
office.
You know,

924
00:54:39,021 --> 00:54:39,620
it's got to keep everything in balance.
What is always trying to do is,

925
00:54:39,621 --> 00:54:41,880
is spend a little bit to make a little 
bit more,

926
00:54:42,480 --> 00:54:43,110
um,
well,

927
00:54:43,210 --> 00:54:46,650
what happens when it spends a little bit
and it doesn't get a revenue back,

928
00:54:46,651 --> 00:54:49,110
there's no reward.
What happens will it goes into the red a

929
00:54:49,111 --> 00:54:54,111
little bit.
So what do you do when something goes 

930
00:54:54,111 --> 00:54:54,111
into the red?
Well,

931
00:54:54,111 --> 00:54:56,130
you might do something risky.
You might actually spend a lot to try to

932
00:54:56,160 --> 00:54:57,260
really make,
you know,

933
00:54:57,270 --> 00:54:59,760
not just make back your deficit,
but actually make a lot.

934
00:55:00,030 --> 00:55:05,030
That would be novelty,
that would be move and spent moving in 

935
00:55:05,030 --> 00:55:05,030
code.

936
00:55:05,030 --> 00:55:07,680
Or you might reduce your spending.
You might say,

937
00:55:07,681 --> 00:55:10,470
well,
I'm going to save a little bit now.

938
00:55:10,860 --> 00:55:13,320
That would be,
I'm not going to move too much.

939
00:55:13,740 --> 00:55:16,380
I'm not gonna spend too much.
I'm not going to code anything.

940
00:55:16,920 --> 00:55:20,130
So I certainly don't mean to suggest to 
you that,

941
00:55:20,190 --> 00:55:25,190
um,
that novelty is unimportant or that 

942
00:55:25,190 --> 00:55:25,190
learning is unimportant.
Um,

943
00:55:25,200 --> 00:55:27,780
and it's a really important question 
about,

944
00:55:28,070 --> 00:55:33,070
um,
what is there any intrinsic value to a 

945
00:55:34,350 --> 00:55:36,760
novelty over and above,
uh,

946
00:55:36,810 --> 00:55:39,960
the rewards that it would give you an 
analysis static sense,

947
00:55:40,440 --> 00:55:45,440
but it is really clear to me that the 
extent to which you,

948
00:55:47,820 --> 00:55:52,820
any nervous system will embrace novelty 
and even seek it pretty much depends on 

949
00:55:53,970 --> 00:55:57,120
the alis static state of that,
of that system.

950
00:55:57,270 --> 00:56:00,600
If you don't have a lot to spend and 
you're already in the red,

951
00:56:01,560 --> 00:56:04,350
if you at a certain point,
if you continue to spend,

952
00:56:04,351 --> 00:56:06,270
when you're in the red,
you go bankrupt.

953
00:56:06,570 --> 00:56:09,240
What that means in human terms is you 
get depressed.

954
00:56:09,570 --> 00:56:14,570
It means that your brain makes you 
fatigued so you can't move and it makes 

955
00:56:14,570 --> 00:56:15,930
you,
locks you in.

956
00:56:15,931 --> 00:56:20,931
So you stop paying attention to anything
going on around you in the world and 

957
00:56:20,931 --> 00:56:24,650
your experiences.
Just what's in your head that that's 

958
00:56:24,650 --> 00:56:24,650
actually what depression is.

959
00:56:26,670 --> 00:56:30,960
It makes me think of Alice is more of as
a range than as a zero,

960
00:56:31,550 --> 00:56:33,760
not homeostasis.
It's Alice thesis.

961
00:56:33,820 --> 00:56:38,820
It's arrange for sure where we.
I'll answer some other questions and 

962
00:56:38,820 --> 00:56:40,000
maybe I'll get back to your first 
question if there's time.

963
00:56:41,950 --> 00:56:43,930
So if I understand your argument 
correctly,

964
00:56:44,230 --> 00:56:47,500
we're going to make anything like a 
general intelligence,

965
00:56:47,680 --> 00:56:49,670
something approaching.
No,

966
00:56:49,690 --> 00:56:49,990
like,
uh,

967
00:56:49,991 --> 00:56:51,190
like a,
a human.

968
00:56:51,920 --> 00:56:55,630
Um,
it needs to be an embodied system.

969
00:56:55,730 --> 00:56:56,020
Well,
I,

970
00:56:56,021 --> 00:56:58,760
I want to be careful about saying that 
because for two reasons.

971
00:56:58,761 --> 00:57:01,760
One,
because in biology there is this concept

972
00:57:01,761 --> 00:57:04,340
of degeneracy,
which is a sucky word,

973
00:57:04,400 --> 00:57:08,690
but it's a great concept and it means 
that there's more than one way to skin a

974
00:57:08,691 --> 00:57:09,560
cat.
Basically,

975
00:57:09,620 --> 00:57:14,620
you want to functional outcome.
There are many ways to get to that 

976
00:57:14,620 --> 00:57:15,230
functional outcome.
So genes for example,

977
00:57:15,410 --> 00:57:20,410
you know,
there are a lot of characteristics that 

978
00:57:20,410 --> 00:57:20,410
are heritable,
but we don't know the genes for them.

979
00:57:20,410 --> 00:57:22,490
And the reason why is that there isn't 
one set of genes,

980
00:57:22,491 --> 00:57:27,491
there are like multiple sets of genes 
that can give you actually the same 

981
00:57:27,491 --> 00:57:30,641
outcome.
So what I want to say is that you need 

982
00:57:30,641 --> 00:57:34,631
something akin to a body.
It doesn't actually have to be a body.

983
00:57:34,850 --> 00:57:39,080
I imagine there are lots of ways that 
you could implement a system.

984
00:57:39,470 --> 00:57:44,470
You can implement an agent that has 
multiple systems of some sort that it 

985
00:57:44,470 --> 00:57:48,491
has to manage,
but my point is that one thing about 

986
00:57:48,491 --> 00:57:51,500
that is very important that we 
continually miss.

987
00:57:51,800 --> 00:57:54,890
When we think about building an agent 
with mental states.

988
00:57:55,100 --> 00:58:00,100
We continually miss the fact that it has
a body and as humans have bodies and 

989
00:58:00,561 --> 00:58:05,561
that's the brain's primary task and our 
most fundamental feelings come from the 

990
00:58:05,901 --> 00:58:10,670
physical changes in our body.
Even though we don't normally experience

991
00:58:10,671 --> 00:58:13,220
it that way.
That actually is how it is.

992
00:58:13,221 --> 00:58:14,780
If you just look at the wiring of the 
brain,

993
00:58:14,781 --> 00:58:19,781
you can just see it.
So it seems to me that if you want to 

994
00:58:19,781 --> 00:58:23,111
build an agent that is human,
like it has to have something like a 

995
00:58:23,111 --> 00:58:28,031
body doesn't have to maybe be a body and
I'm sure there are many clever ways that

996
00:58:28,071 --> 00:58:32,720
you could implement something like a 
body without it actually being a body,

997
00:58:32,721 --> 00:58:34,130
if you know,
if you understand what I mean.

998
00:58:34,970 --> 00:58:39,970
So Amazon,
Alexa couldn't be there if we just gave 

999
00:58:40,761 --> 00:58:45,761
it some sort of representation of mental
states or some kind of alostatic target.

1000
00:58:47,840 --> 00:58:48,360
Sure.

1001
00:58:51,160 --> 00:58:52,430
Here's the.
Let me just say one other thing.

1002
00:58:52,470 --> 00:58:57,470
I think it's really important.
All the brain requires is that you at 

1003
00:58:57,581 --> 00:58:59,830
some point had a body.
You don't.

1004
00:59:00,160 --> 00:59:05,160
Right?
So basically being this is what phantom 

1005
00:59:05,160 --> 00:59:07,570
limb pain is,
this is what chronic pain is,

1006
00:59:07,571 --> 00:59:08,680
this is what happened.
You know,

1007
00:59:08,920 --> 00:59:13,780
if at some point you cease to get 
information from your body anymore,

1008
00:59:13,930 --> 00:59:18,930
your brain still can simulate,
still can reinstate the sensory patterns

1009
00:59:19,661 --> 00:59:23,660
that once came from the.
And that's what's required,

1010
00:59:24,260 --> 00:59:29,260
right?
At some point the body isn't really 

1011
00:59:29,260 --> 00:59:29,260
needed anymore.
Yeah,

1012
00:59:30,320 --> 00:59:31,550
I think we're here.
Yeah.

1013
00:59:32,670 --> 00:59:36,160
Emotions in humans are implemented by a 
bunch of hacks,

1014
00:59:36,170 --> 00:59:39,170
so there's a bunch of chemicals that go 
into your brain,

1015
00:59:39,800 --> 00:59:42,770
the oxytocin,
Serotonin,

1016
00:59:43,800 --> 00:59:48,800
a whole bunch of biochemical things that
diffused around in the fluids in your 

1017
00:59:48,800 --> 00:59:52,451
brain that affects your emotional state,
and that seems like a hack that we've 

1018
00:59:52,451 --> 00:59:54,620
inherited over millions of years from 
premature ancestors.

1019
00:59:55,000 --> 01:00:00,000
I'm an.
If you look at the machine learning 

1020
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:00,000
world,
we can do a bunch of similar things with

1021
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:04,241
neural net,
so you can increase the activation 

1022
01:00:04,241 --> 01:00:04,241
threshold on a large scale.
Yeah,

1023
01:00:04,241 --> 01:00:06,410
change the map noise going into the 
system.

1024
01:00:06,590 --> 01:00:11,590
You can do a bunch of similar things,
but you don't have to rely on fluids 

1025
01:00:11,590 --> 01:00:12,170
being,
um,

1026
01:00:12,260 --> 01:00:15,140
kind of cleaned slowly by glial cells.
Um,

1027
01:00:15,170 --> 01:00:18,800
things don't diffuse around in and 
fluids in the system necessarily.

1028
01:00:18,890 --> 01:00:20,840
It seems like there's a lot more 
flexibility.

1029
01:00:21,860 --> 01:00:23,540
So when you come to an implementation,
there's not many,

1030
01:00:23,570 --> 01:00:28,280
so many constraints imposed by the 
evolutionary history on the whole system

1031
01:00:28,490 --> 01:00:30,230
and it seems like that would make it 
work better.

1032
01:00:30,231 --> 01:00:32,690
So when people are in negative emotional
states,

1033
01:00:32,860 --> 01:00:34,130
um,
they can't think straight,

1034
01:00:35,210 --> 01:00:38,000
not true.
People can think actually quite well and

1035
01:00:38,001 --> 01:00:39,600
negative emotional states.
I haven't tell you.

1036
01:00:39,990 --> 01:00:41,280
So emotion,

1037
01:00:42,660 --> 01:00:45,770
they can do very nefarious things very,
very effectively.

1038
01:00:45,860 --> 01:00:48,620
Right?
So the general point I think is true,

1039
01:00:48,680 --> 01:00:51,290
even if the example is not so,
um,

1040
01:00:51,920 --> 01:00:55,910
emotions kind of flood your nervous 
system with emotions don't flood,

1041
01:00:55,911 --> 01:00:57,920
you're nervous.
Some of them do.

1042
01:00:58,770 --> 01:01:03,770
So here's the thing in your bloodstream 
stream,

1043
01:01:06,280 --> 01:01:08,360
let's talk about this chemicals.
There was not a single camera

1044
01:01:08,410 --> 01:01:12,310
well in your brain or anywhere in your 
nervous system that is for emotion.

1045
01:01:12,910 --> 01:01:16,000
Serotonin is not for emotion domain,
it's not promotion.

1046
01:01:16,080 --> 01:01:19,540
Oxy chosen is not for emotion,
even opioid,

1047
01:01:19,541 --> 01:01:24,541
you know,
even even even opioids are not for 

1048
01:01:24,541 --> 01:01:24,541
emotion.

1049
01:01:24,541 --> 01:01:25,120
So they influenced your emotions,
very involved,

1050
01:01:25,320 --> 01:01:25,850
influenced

1051
01:01:26,050 --> 01:01:30,370
every mental event that you have,
not just emotion,

1052
01:01:30,620 --> 01:01:32,710
so your brain,
for example,

1053
01:01:32,770 --> 01:01:37,770
your brain is a physical.
It's a set of physical cells that are 

1054
01:01:38,471 --> 01:01:43,471
bathed in neurochemical systems and the 
neurochemical systems that you're 

1055
01:01:43,471 --> 01:01:47,401
referring to basically change the ease 
with which information is passed back 

1056
01:01:47,401 --> 01:01:50,290
and forth between those neurons.
That's always true.

1057
01:01:50,620 --> 01:01:55,620
It's true.
Regardless of whether the event is 

1058
01:01:55,620 --> 01:01:57,730
emotion or whether it's a perception or 
whether it's a thought or whether it's a

1059
01:01:57,731 --> 01:02:00,040
belief,
it's always true.

1060
01:02:00,220 --> 01:02:02,230
So for example,
serotonin.

1061
01:02:02,650 --> 01:02:07,650
Serotonin is a neurotransmitter that 
allows your brain to delay gratification

1062
01:02:09,401 --> 01:02:14,401
of a reward.
It allows you to expend energy now 

1063
01:02:14,401 --> 01:02:17,620
because you anticipate a reward at some 
point in the future,

1064
01:02:18,100 --> 01:02:22,740
and if you have a deficit in Serotonin,
then you can't do that very well.

1065
01:02:22,800 --> 01:02:27,800
And it turns out for humans,
one of our great superpowers is the 

1066
01:02:27,800 --> 01:02:31,461
ability to do mental time travel,
to remember in the past,

1067
01:02:31,621 --> 01:02:36,621
and also to do things now because we 
know they're gonna have an effect 10 or 

1068
01:02:36,621 --> 01:02:38,250
20 or 50 or 100 years from now.

1069
01:02:38,910 --> 01:02:40,420
So the,
the,

1070
01:02:40,910 --> 01:02:45,910
you know,
in when I said you have to have 

1071
01:02:45,910 --> 01:02:47,481
something like a body.
I'm not saying literally you have to 

1072
01:02:47,481 --> 01:02:48,810
have a physical corporeal body.
I'm saying you have to have.

1073
01:02:49,710 --> 01:02:51,360
I mean,
it's just a fact.

1074
01:02:51,361 --> 01:02:54,720
It's not an argument.
It's a fact that your brain,

1075
01:02:54,721 --> 01:02:59,550
that brains evolved for the purposes of 
regulating multiple systems.

1076
01:03:00,050 --> 01:03:02,610
Um,
and from a cybernetic standpoint,

1077
01:03:03,000 --> 01:03:08,000
you know,
the best way to regulate a system is to 

1078
01:03:08,000 --> 01:03:08,000
build an internal model of it.
That's what your brain is.

1079
01:03:08,000 --> 01:03:10,560
Your brain is an internal model of your 
body in the world.

1080
01:03:10,590 --> 01:03:13,410
It's running simulations,
it's running this model.

1081
01:03:13,590 --> 01:03:18,590
And if you want to have an agent that is
somewhat humanlike that has feelings 

1082
01:03:18,590 --> 01:03:21,240
like humans,
then they have to do something that they

1083
01:03:21,241 --> 01:03:26,241
have to have to be able to do something 
similar and whether it's a actual 

1084
01:03:26,241 --> 01:03:27,840
physical corporeal body or not,
I think is,

1085
01:03:28,170 --> 01:03:29,570
you know,
that's an open question.

1086
01:03:31,590 --> 01:03:36,590
Premises before I've got to my question.
So I started off by saying I started off

1087
01:03:36,971 --> 01:03:40,060
by saying emotions are implemented as a 
bunch of hacks.

1088
01:03:40,150 --> 01:03:45,150
So would you say broadly correct?
Or would you say that they're not hacks,

1089
01:03:45,371 --> 01:03:48,050
they're finely tuned and adaptive and.
Well,

1090
01:03:48,280 --> 01:03:51,440
I wouldn't say not maladaptive,
but would you say it's a bunch of hacks?

1091
01:03:52,460 --> 01:03:53,780
I don't know what you mean by hacks

1092
01:03:55,120 --> 01:03:57,690
is kind of historical accident.

1093
01:03:58,900 --> 01:04:03,900
You're talking about emotions like 
they're talking the premise of your 

1094
01:04:03,900 --> 01:04:08,271
question.
I can't answer your question because I 

1095
01:04:08,271 --> 01:04:08,271
think it's not the correct question.
I mean,

1096
01:04:08,490 --> 01:04:12,360
it's.
Emotions aren't like blood pressure,

1097
01:04:12,540 --> 01:04:15,240
you know,
they don't exist in that sense.

1098
01:04:15,870 --> 01:04:17,040
They are,
um,

1099
01:04:18,080 --> 01:04:21,620
they are the way that they are.
First of all,

1100
01:04:21,621 --> 01:04:26,621
not all cultures have.
Not all people in all cultures have 

1101
01:04:27,081 --> 01:04:29,690
emotions.
Everybody has an effect.

1102
01:04:29,870 --> 01:04:32,330
Assuming they have a neurotypical brain 
of sorts,

1103
01:04:32,660 --> 01:04:35,840
but um,
but they don't all have emotion.

1104
01:04:36,050 --> 01:04:41,050
And so to answer your question that your
answer asking me is I can't answer it 

1105
01:04:41,211 --> 01:04:42,900
because I don't think it's the right.
I don't think so.

1106
01:04:43,090 --> 01:04:48,090
The right question.
The pain systems seem like things that 

1107
01:04:50,070 --> 01:04:53,830
influence your emotions fairly directly.
So this is not the same thing,

1108
01:04:53,950 --> 01:04:55,210
but it's a powerful link.

1109
01:04:56,560 --> 01:05:01,560
Opioids though.
So opioids are important for instances 

1110
01:05:02,711 --> 01:05:07,711
of emotion,
but they are also important for every 

1111
01:05:07,711 --> 01:05:11,220
other category of mental event that you 
brand can make a lot of other things 

1112
01:05:11,220 --> 01:05:11,740
too.
I agree.

1113
01:05:12,270 --> 01:05:13,810
Um,
so I,

1114
01:05:14,340 --> 01:05:15,250
I,
you know,

1115
01:05:15,510 --> 01:05:19,590
but you will see sometimes will assign,
you know,

1116
01:05:19,630 --> 01:05:24,630
I'm an emotional meaning to something 
like dopamine is for first hedonic 

1117
01:05:25,391 --> 01:05:30,391
pleasantness and then it's for reward.
People like to assign single functions 

1118
01:05:30,391 --> 01:05:35,310
to biological entities like a chemical 
or a brain region,

1119
01:05:35,741 --> 01:05:39,790
a cluster of neurons or it's just not.
That's really.

1120
01:05:39,880 --> 01:05:43,060
I'm not saying every chemical does 
everything but whatever.

1121
01:05:43,061 --> 01:05:48,061
Okay.
Whatever opioids do they do in every 

1122
01:05:48,061 --> 01:05:51,531
waking moment of your life,
not just in moments that are emotional 

1123
01:05:51,751 --> 01:05:52,170
for you.

1124
01:05:52,310 --> 01:05:53,100
Um,
I should stop now.

1125
01:05:53,160 --> 01:05:57,150
I'm thinking.
Yeah,

1126
01:05:58,380 --> 01:06:03,380
I figure it was very interesting that 
you brought up the last topic of love 

1127
01:06:03,380 --> 01:06:05,910
because I think it actually brings up a 
really important thing which is,

1128
01:06:06,190 --> 01:06:08,310
and what you were saying about 
connection,

1129
01:06:09,960 --> 01:06:13,620
that's the primary purpose of life is to
procreate,

1130
01:06:14,130 --> 01:06:15,000
right?
I mean that,

1131
01:06:15,310 --> 01:06:18,270
that's what our deans do.
So first of all,

1132
01:06:18,271 --> 01:06:21,250
right,
I'm not going to be touching that.

1133
01:06:23,890 --> 01:06:28,890
I'm so that.
And of course in humans it's not just 

1134
01:06:31,890 --> 01:06:33,150
genetic,
it's mimetic.

1135
01:06:33,151 --> 01:06:38,151
I mean we,
we procreate our ideas as well as 

1136
01:06:38,151 --> 01:06:42,380
physically and so a primary purpose of 
our winning our,

1137
01:06:44,070 --> 01:06:49,070
our reactions and interactions with 
other people and other things is that 

1138
01:06:51,961 --> 01:06:56,961
goal is that we get rewarded when we 
interact with other things in a way that

1139
01:06:58,050 --> 01:07:01,920
creates something new,
whether it's art or you know,

1140
01:07:02,100 --> 01:07:04,560
a book or technology or something like 
that.

1141
01:07:04,920 --> 01:07:09,920
And if we don't put that,
if there's no inherent reason for a 

1142
01:07:11,461 --> 01:07:15,000
robot or a computer system to want to do
that,

1143
01:07:15,001 --> 01:07:15,620
I mean,
how do,

1144
01:07:16,080 --> 01:07:21,080
how could we can even imagine putting 
that into a system inherently that it 

1145
01:07:24,270 --> 01:07:29,270
wants to,
that it just desperately wants to make 

1146
01:07:29,270 --> 01:07:30,890
something new.
I mean,

1147
01:07:31,210 --> 01:07:32,200
well,
here's what I would say,

1148
01:07:32,201 --> 01:07:32,990
you know,
when we're,

1149
01:07:33,200 --> 01:07:34,000
when,
first of all,

1150
01:07:34,030 --> 01:07:38,320
when we talk about,
we've been focusing a lot on bodies.

1151
01:07:38,321 --> 01:07:40,330
I'm certainly not saying that's a 
sufficient condition,

1152
01:07:40,331 --> 01:07:45,331
right?
I'm just saying it's a necessary one or 

1153
01:07:45,331 --> 01:07:47,551
something like a body.
But I certainly have the motivation to 

1154
01:07:47,551 --> 01:07:50,200
create.
And I'm imagining that you do too.

1155
01:07:50,260 --> 01:07:52,240
I have to tell you,
not everybody has that.

1156
01:07:53,730 --> 01:07:57,300
Most adolescents don't have that many 
adolescents don't have it.

1157
01:07:57,301 --> 01:07:58,410
Okay.
That was a joke.

1158
01:07:58,500 --> 01:08:00,990
I have a teenage daughter just telling 
you.

1159
01:08:02,480 --> 01:08:03,950
But the point is that,
um,

1160
01:08:04,290 --> 01:08:09,290
that what people,
what people find rewarding is remarkably

1161
01:08:10,051 --> 01:08:15,051
diverse.
But the property I think is that there 

1162
01:08:16,731 --> 01:08:21,170
has to be a feature of reward for,
for a lot of people,

1163
01:08:21,171 --> 01:08:21,870
that's,
you know,

1164
01:08:22,040 --> 01:08:27,040
that's having an impact in some way.
I'm having an impact on another person 

1165
01:08:27,040 --> 01:08:28,360
having an impact,
um,

1166
01:08:28,490 --> 01:08:31,880
you know,
on a building,

1167
01:08:31,881 --> 01:08:33,560
something that wasn't there before,
whatever,

1168
01:08:33,561 --> 01:08:34,030
you know,
in,

1169
01:08:34,060 --> 01:08:39,060
in innovating or I'm discovering,
but it's not true for everybody.

1170
01:08:39,290 --> 01:08:43,640
It's just true for a lot of people in 
this room probably.

1171
01:08:43,820 --> 01:08:46,130
And certainly the people that we 
probably spend a lot of time with,

1172
01:08:46,131 --> 01:08:47,600
but not,
not for everybody.

1173
01:08:47,601 --> 01:08:50,210
There's also the genetic part.
Sure.

1174
01:08:50,211 --> 01:08:50,930
I mean,
look,

1175
01:08:50,960 --> 01:08:52,090
but if you want to,
you know,

1176
01:08:52,190 --> 01:08:53,140
if you want to,
um,

1177
01:08:53,141 --> 01:08:53,740
if you,
you know,

1178
01:08:53,750 --> 01:08:56,300
we can certainly make a,
a genetic argument here.

1179
01:08:56,301 --> 01:08:59,060
Absolutely.
They're there.

1180
01:09:00,890 --> 01:09:05,890
The,
there's nothing that I've said today 

1181
01:09:05,890 --> 01:09:08,510
that is inconsistent with the idea that,
um,

1182
01:09:08,810 --> 01:09:13,810
that you have,
that you have to pass your genes onto 

1183
01:09:13,810 --> 01:09:16,120
the next generation and actually make 
sure that that generation survives to 

1184
01:09:16,120 --> 01:09:19,940
reproductive age.
It's not just enough to have offspring.

1185
01:09:19,941 --> 01:09:23,660
You have to make sure that the offspring
survive to reproductive age.

1186
01:09:23,990 --> 01:09:28,990
And there's a whole argument about,
you know,

1187
01:09:31,250 --> 01:09:33,380
uh,
the,

1188
01:09:35,300 --> 01:09:37,850
the learning of,
um,

1189
01:09:39,530 --> 01:09:44,530
social reality,
concepts of social reality that we've 

1190
01:09:44,530 --> 01:09:44,870
been talking about,
like money and emotions and so on.

1191
01:09:46,160 --> 01:09:47,810
That makes that argument,
right,

1192
01:09:47,840 --> 01:09:52,840
that it's very expensive to have to 
encode everything in jeans or to have to

1193
01:09:53,750 --> 01:09:56,690
learn everything from scratch,
every generation.

1194
01:09:56,930 --> 01:10:01,930
So instead what we have is a system,
a genetic system that allows us to wire 

1195
01:10:02,181 --> 01:10:03,970
the brains of the young,
uh,

1196
01:10:04,070 --> 01:10:07,760
with what we know and that's what we do 
basically.

1197
01:10:08,340 --> 01:10:12,160
Alright.
So it's the.

1198
01:10:13,020 --> 01:10:18,020
I'm curious about your analogy about 
intentionality that you talked about 

1199
01:10:18,020 --> 01:10:22,581
when you use the analogy between money 
and the perception of read to the facts 

1200
01:10:23,401 --> 01:10:28,401
that we,
the fact that we have emotion because 

1201
01:10:28,401 --> 01:10:32,270
the distinguishing feature,
it seems to me is the level of 

1202
01:10:32,270 --> 01:10:32,700
intentionality.
And as you said before,

1203
01:10:32,940 --> 01:10:36,570
our brain assigns meaning to things but 
we don't or maybe.

1204
01:10:36,620 --> 01:10:39,600
And my question is whether or not you 
agree with this.

1205
01:10:39,601 --> 01:10:42,150
I guess we don't always deliberately 
assigned.

1206
01:10:42,320 --> 01:10:47,320
No,
this is nothing I've said is about ever 

1207
01:10:47,320 --> 01:10:47,320
delivered.

1208
01:10:47,320 --> 01:10:48,310
But sometimes we do sometimes quite 
often actually.

1209
01:10:48,340 --> 01:10:50,980
Yeah.
So when you go back to like the question

1210
01:10:50,981 --> 01:10:54,910
of what makes something intelligent,
a lot of previous talks have been about,

1211
01:10:55,060 --> 01:11:00,060
you know,
we want to pick a goal and then we 

1212
01:11:00,060 --> 01:11:03,010
create costs to achieve that goal,
but that goal is deliberately assigned.

1213
01:11:03,460 --> 01:11:06,970
So when you talk about like what makes 
something intelligent,

1214
01:11:08,080 --> 01:11:12,340
what do you think the role of 
intentionality is and the spectrum there

1215
01:11:12,341 --> 01:11:13,590
in?
So first of all,

1216
01:11:13,591 --> 01:11:14,040
we talk about

1217
01:11:14,040 --> 01:11:19,040
intentionality.
I think you have to really be careful 

1218
01:11:19,040 --> 01:11:21,261
that you are.
Philosophers talk about intentionality 

1219
01:11:21,261 --> 01:11:21,990
in two ways.
They talk about intentionality to mean a

1220
01:11:21,991 --> 01:11:26,991
deliberate action the way you mean it,
but intentionality can also mean that 

1221
01:11:26,991 --> 01:11:29,640
something has a reference out in the 
real world outside of you.

1222
01:11:29,940 --> 01:11:31,140
Really.
So that a word,

1223
01:11:31,160 --> 01:11:33,960
a word has a,
a reference that's the,

1224
01:11:33,961 --> 01:11:34,830
um,
you know,

1225
01:11:34,860 --> 01:11:37,410
the intention of the,
of the word basically.

1226
01:11:37,610 --> 01:11:38,970
So I think you have to be really 
careful.

1227
01:11:39,150 --> 01:11:42,450
I also think that you have to make a 
distinction between a conscious,

1228
01:11:42,600 --> 01:11:47,600
deliberate,
explicitly a goal that you can 

1229
01:11:48,931 --> 01:11:53,931
explicitly describe.
And I'm a,

1230
01:11:56,990 --> 01:11:57,480
I mean,
you're,

1231
01:11:57,540 --> 01:12:00,180
you're sort of making your,
sort of,

1232
01:12:00,181 --> 01:12:05,181
making the kind of question you're 
asking is getting very close to the 

1233
01:12:05,181 --> 01:12:07,050
question of freewill.
Joe would love to not have to discuss,

1234
01:12:07,440 --> 01:12:12,440
but um,
but basically what I'm about to say is 

1235
01:12:12,440 --> 01:12:14,220
gonna sound very Cartesian,
unfortunately,

1236
01:12:14,221 --> 01:12:15,660
because that's English.

1237
01:12:15,720 --> 01:12:18,090
I don't know.
There's no other way to do it actually.

1238
01:12:18,360 --> 01:12:22,110
But what I want to say is that your 
brain is always,

1239
01:12:22,440 --> 01:12:23,730
there's always,
um,

1240
01:12:24,120 --> 01:12:29,120
volition,
but it's not always consciously 

1241
01:12:29,120 --> 01:12:30,000
experienced by you as,
as agency or will.

1242
01:12:30,420 --> 01:12:33,520
So you're not a,
you're not a,

1243
01:12:33,630 --> 01:12:35,010
a sea urchin.
You know,

1244
01:12:35,070 --> 01:12:38,790
your sensory neurons are not hardwired 
to your motor neurons.

1245
01:12:39,030 --> 01:12:41,790
You have interneurons.
That means you have choice.

1246
01:12:41,791 --> 01:12:44,730
Do you consciously experienced yourself 
as making choices all the time?

1247
01:12:44,731 --> 01:12:45,510
No,
you don't,

1248
01:12:45,511 --> 01:12:48,720
but your brain is actually making 
choices all the time.

1249
01:12:48,990 --> 01:12:51,270
That's why people who study decision 
making,

1250
01:12:51,520 --> 01:12:56,520
you know,
think they're studying the whole brain 

1251
01:12:56,520 --> 01:12:56,520
because they,
they are actually.

1252
01:12:56,520 --> 01:12:59,880
Um,
so I think you have to be really careful

1253
01:12:59,970 --> 01:13:04,970
about.
There are words that we use in English 

1254
01:13:04,970 --> 01:13:09,320
and in science that have two meanings.
They can have a meaning that is about 

1255
01:13:10,201 --> 01:13:15,201
decision making or choice that is just 
obligatory automatic and a function of 

1256
01:13:16,021 --> 01:13:20,580
how the system works and then there's 
the kind of choice that feels deliberate

1257
01:13:20,581 --> 01:13:24,960
and effortful and where we feel like 
we're the agents we experience ourselves

1258
01:13:24,961 --> 01:13:25,940
as the agents.

1259
01:13:26,130 --> 01:13:29,190
Um,
and intentionality.

1260
01:13:29,460 --> 01:13:32,400
I'm usually can be assigned to the 
second one,

1261
01:13:32,401 --> 01:13:34,680
but actually in truth,
in philosophical terms,

1262
01:13:34,681 --> 01:13:37,590
it can also be assigned to the first 
that when you,

1263
01:13:37,620 --> 01:13:42,620
even,
if you're completely unaware of having 

1264
01:13:42,620 --> 01:13:45,861
made a choice,
you're acting on something with some 

1265
01:13:45,861 --> 01:13:47,960
degree of volition because you,
you,

1266
01:13:48,060 --> 01:13:51,810
it's not a reflex.
It's not like somebody hit your patellar

1267
01:13:51,840 --> 01:13:53,160
tendon,
a new kit.

1268
01:13:53,340 --> 01:13:55,170
And so it's really interesting that.
So,

1269
01:13:55,410 --> 01:13:56,580
you know,
I think you just have to,

1270
01:13:56,640 --> 01:13:59,490
you have to make that distinction and I 
probably should get to the next question

1271
01:13:59,491 --> 01:14:00,890
we can follow.
Yeah.

1272
01:14:01,430 --> 01:14:01,830
Yep.

1273
01:14:02,450 --> 01:14:07,450
Uh,
so you've been asked a lot of esoteric 

1274
01:14:07,450 --> 01:14:09,631
questions about ai,
but I think we might gain some insights 

1275
01:14:09,631 --> 01:14:11,740
by wondering about Dei.
That is a dog intelligence.

1276
01:14:13,180 --> 01:14:18,180
So I believe I,
I sort of understand what my dog is 

1277
01:14:18,180 --> 01:14:20,830
feeling and I,
I usually believe that,

1278
01:14:20,860 --> 01:14:22,090
um,
my dog,

1279
01:14:22,240 --> 01:14:23,710
you know,
believes the same,

1280
01:14:24,300 --> 01:14:26,410
um,
but not the same with,

1281
01:14:26,430 --> 01:14:29,410
you know,
a cat and you're not a cat person.

1282
01:14:30,200 --> 01:14:32,100
Sure.
Um,

1283
01:14:32,160 --> 01:14:33,040
and,
you know,

1284
01:14:33,110 --> 01:14:35,620
I'm not,
I don't know that much about monkeys,

1285
01:14:35,930 --> 01:14:39,400
but I've never really seen a monkey be 
able to make the expressions that are,

1286
01:14:39,490 --> 01:14:41,400
let's say a dog can.
Um,

1287
01:14:42,040 --> 01:14:47,040
and I was wondering if you had any 
insights about why dogs are able to do 

1288
01:14:47,040 --> 01:14:50,500
this and why we're able to read dogs.
Is it something just simple,

1289
01:14:50,501 --> 01:14:53,470
like they're,
they have the right facial muscles or is

1290
01:14:53,471 --> 01:14:58,471
it something,
some drive that allows them to learn 

1291
01:14:58,471 --> 01:14:58,471
this?

1292
01:14:58,471 --> 01:15:02,090
So I think before I wrote my book,
I would have answered this question 

1293
01:15:02,090 --> 01:15:02,190
differently.
Um,

1294
01:15:02,910 --> 01:15:04,860
but now here's what I would say.
I think,

1295
01:15:04,870 --> 01:15:06,660
um,
you know,

1296
01:15:06,990 --> 01:15:10,350
many creatures on this planet have an 
effect,

1297
01:15:11,320 --> 01:15:14,940
right?
And we can debate about whether,

1298
01:15:14,941 --> 01:15:16,560
you know,
I just came across a paper the other day

1299
01:15:16,561 --> 01:15:17,880
about whether fly,
you know,

1300
01:15:17,900 --> 01:15:21,070
just her Sophala have an have an effect 
and you know,

1301
01:15:21,100 --> 01:15:26,100
it's,
it's actually a really interesting 

1302
01:15:26,100 --> 01:15:26,100
question.
They certainly,

1303
01:15:26,100 --> 01:15:26,100
they have something like opioids and 
they,

1304
01:15:26,100 --> 01:15:30,950
you know,
so it's essentially a question but dogs 

1305
01:15:31,050 --> 01:15:36,050
dogs are really interesting because they
do seem to have some capacities that 

1306
01:15:38,250 --> 01:15:43,250
only that you only see in,
in great apes and they may have 

1307
01:15:44,281 --> 01:15:47,430
capacities that great apes even other 
than us don't have.

1308
01:15:48,330 --> 01:15:53,330
And I mean,
so they certainly have some capacities 

1309
01:15:53,330 --> 01:15:53,330
we don't have either,
but.

1310
01:15:53,330 --> 01:15:54,240
But here's my point.
We actually bred them.

1311
01:15:55,230 --> 01:16:00,230
We bred these animals,
we selected them basically not natural 

1312
01:16:00,230 --> 01:16:00,660
selection.
It's,

1313
01:16:01,100 --> 01:16:06,100
it's artificial selection.
And we selected them for a couple of 

1314
01:16:06,100 --> 01:16:06,250
things,
right?

1315
01:16:06,370 --> 01:16:08,500
If you look at the experiments on 
breeding,

1316
01:16:08,950 --> 01:16:10,090
taking a Fox,
you know,

1317
01:16:10,091 --> 01:16:13,810
taking foxes and breeding them into what
looked like a little dog like animals.

1318
01:16:14,050 --> 01:16:19,050
It's interesting what they can do and 
one of the things they can do is they 

1319
01:16:19,050 --> 01:16:19,050
can move their facial muscles and in,
in,

1320
01:16:19,100 --> 01:16:24,100
in a lot of ways that they have a lot 
more control over their facial muscles 

1321
01:16:24,100 --> 01:16:26,350
then chimpanzees and uh,
do um,

1322
01:16:26,440 --> 01:16:28,000
and,
and other apes,

1323
01:16:28,200 --> 01:16:31,030
um,
and they also do,

1324
01:16:31,031 --> 01:16:34,950
um,
they do joint attention really well with

1325
01:16:34,951 --> 01:16:39,951
gays.
So this is something that really no 

1326
01:16:39,951 --> 01:16:41,370
other animal can do,
I think other than a dog,

1327
01:16:41,400 --> 01:16:43,470
other end humans.
And that is,

1328
01:16:43,680 --> 01:16:45,150
they can,
they,

1329
01:16:45,690 --> 01:16:50,690
they meet your gaze and they use gaze 
for reference so you know,

1330
01:16:51,911 --> 01:16:54,470
they'll look at something and they'll 
look back at you and you know,

1331
01:16:54,520 --> 01:16:59,520
that's actually partly,
that's how we communicate with each 

1332
01:16:59,520 --> 01:16:59,520
other.

1333
01:16:59,520 --> 01:17:02,010
Chimpanzees lose that ability after 
about 10 or 11 months,

1334
01:17:02,011 --> 01:17:04,290
a year of age,
but,

1335
01:17:04,350 --> 01:17:08,760
but dogs continually do it.
And actually joint attention,

1336
01:17:08,810 --> 01:17:12,500
shared gaze is how we communicate with 
our infants will also.

1337
01:17:12,501 --> 01:17:17,501
That's actually partly how we teach 
infants about what's important in the 

1338
01:17:17,501 --> 01:17:20,471
world is with gays.
So I think that dogs may actually have 

1339
01:17:20,471 --> 01:17:25,190
some capacities probably because we bred
them to have those,

1340
01:17:25,330 --> 01:17:28,300
but we selected the animals that,
uh,

1341
01:17:28,470 --> 01:17:29,930
you know,
and bred them to,

1342
01:17:29,980 --> 01:17:32,630
to have those capacities.
That's very interesting.

1343
01:17:32,690 --> 01:17:33,800
Thank you.
Awesome.

1344
01:17:33,801 --> 01:17:35,810
What would that.
Let's get at least a big hand.

1345
01:17:35,811 --> 01:17:36,320
Thank you so much.
