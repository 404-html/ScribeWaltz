1
00:00:00,090 --> 00:00:02,040
As part of Mit course success,
zero,

2
00:00:02,041 --> 00:00:04,650
nine,
nine on artificial general intelligence,

3
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:06,900
I got a chance to sit down and Christof 
Koch,

4
00:00:07,320 --> 00:00:12,320
who's one of the seminal figures in 
neurobiology and neuroscience and 

5
00:00:13,170 --> 00:00:16,830
generally in the study of consciousness.
He's the president,

6
00:00:16,890 --> 00:00:21,890
the chief scientific officer of the 
Allen Institute for Brain Science in 

7
00:00:21,890 --> 00:00:26,391
Seattle from 1986 to 2013.
He was the professor at Caltech before 

8
00:00:27,451 --> 00:00:31,410
that he was at mit.
He is extremely well cited,

9
00:00:31,650 --> 00:00:33,450
over 100,000
citations.

10
00:00:33,750 --> 00:00:35,220
His research,
his writing,

11
00:00:35,221 --> 00:00:40,221
his ideas have had big impact on the 
scientific community and the general 

12
00:00:40,221 --> 00:00:44,481
public in the way we think about 
consciousness in the way we see 

13
00:00:44,481 --> 00:00:46,140
ourselves as human beings.
He's the author of several books,

14
00:00:46,350 --> 00:00:49,110
the quest of consciousness in Europe,
biological approach,

15
00:00:49,230 --> 00:00:54,230
and a more recent book consciousness,
confessions of a romantic reductionist.

16
00:00:55,080 --> 00:00:57,390

Thanks very much and I hope you enjoy.
Okay.

22
00:01:12,131 --> 00:01:16,240
Before we delve into the beautiful 
mysteries of consciousness,

23
00:01:16,480 --> 00:01:20,250
let's zoom out a little bit and let me 
ask,

24
00:01:20,340 --> 00:01:23,470
do you think there's intelligent life 
out there in the universe or.

25
00:01:23,550 --> 00:01:24,870
Yes,
I do believe so.

26
00:01:25,440 --> 00:01:30,440
We have no evidence of it,
but I think the possibilities are 

27
00:01:30,440 --> 00:01:32,340
overwhelming in favor of it.
Give them a universe of where we have 10

28
00:01:32,341 --> 00:01:35,610
to 11 galaxies and each galaxy has 
between 10 to 11,

29
00:01:35,611 --> 00:01:36,360
10 to the twelfth

30
00:01:37,310 --> 00:01:42,310
stars.
And we know most stars have one or more 

31
00:01:42,310 --> 00:01:42,510
planet.
So how does that make you feel?

32
00:01:43,430 --> 00:01:48,270
It still makes me feel special because I
have experiences.

33
00:01:49,050 --> 00:01:51,030
I feel the world experienced the world

34
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:57,000
and uh,
independent of whether they are other 

35
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,780
creatures out there.
I still feel the world and I have access

36
00:01:58,781 --> 00:02:01,480
to this world in this very strange,
compelling way.

37
00:02:01,950 --> 00:02:06,830
And that's the core of human existence.
Now you said human.

38
00:02:07,010 --> 00:02:10,310
Do you think if those intelligent 
creatures are out there,

39
00:02:10,340 --> 00:02:13,650
do you think they experience their 
world?

40
00:02:14,100 --> 00:02:14,720
That's true.
They

41
00:02:14,760 --> 00:02:19,760
evolved.
If they are a product of natural 

42
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:19,760
evolution,
if they would have to be,

43
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:19,970
they will also experience the owned 
world.

44
00:02:20,120 --> 00:02:22,650
The consciousness isn't just Schumann.
You hide it.

45
00:02:22,690 --> 00:02:24,320
It's much wider.
It's probably.

46
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:29,560
It may be spread across all of biology.
We have the only thing that we have 

47
00:02:29,560 --> 00:02:30,770
specialists.
We can talk about it.

48
00:02:31,300 --> 00:02:36,300
I've got not all people can talk about 
the babies and little children can talk 

49
00:02:36,300 --> 00:02:38,420
about a patient who have.
We have a stoke in the left.

50
00:02:38,421 --> 00:02:40,310
Inferior frontal gyrus can talk about 
it,

51
00:02:40,760 --> 00:02:45,760
but most normal adult people can talk 
about it and so we think that makes us 

52
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:47,860
special compared to letting monkeys or 
dogs or cats and mice,

53
00:02:47,900 --> 00:02:50,120
all the other creatures that we share 
the planet with,

54
00:02:50,630 --> 00:02:54,560
but all the evidence seems to suggest 
that they to experience the world and so

55
00:02:54,561 --> 00:02:59,561
it's like overwhelmingly likely that 
other alien that aliens would also 

56
00:02:59,561 --> 00:03:03,191
experience their world of course 
differently because they have a 

57
00:03:03,191 --> 00:03:03,191
difference in psyllium.
They have different sense of.

58
00:03:03,191 --> 00:03:07,681
They have a very different environment,
but the fact that I would strongly 

59
00:03:07,681 --> 00:03:12,610
support that they also have experiences 
if your pain and pleasure and see in 

60
00:03:13,121 --> 00:03:15,580
some sort of spectrum and he,
uh,

61
00:03:15,581 --> 00:03:17,290
and have all the other senses,

62
00:03:17,650 --> 00:03:19,440
of course their language if they have 
one,

63
00:03:19,450 --> 00:03:24,450
will be different.
So women understand their poetry about 

64
00:03:24,450 --> 00:03:25,120
the experiences that they have.
That's correct.

65
00:03:25,180 --> 00:03:27,790
Right.
So in a talk,

66
00:03:27,820 --> 00:03:32,350
in a video,
I've heard you mentioned adac sound that

67
00:03:32,351 --> 00:03:36,090
you came up with the you grew up with as
part of your family when you were young.

68
00:03:36,750 --> 00:03:41,750
Uh,
first of all your technically a 

69
00:03:41,750 --> 00:03:44,381
midwestern boy.
He just technically after that,

70
00:03:45,030 --> 00:03:48,050
a trial of that are on a bit and a 
little bit of the accent.

71
00:03:48,290 --> 00:03:53,290
You talked about supports all the taxol 
and having these elements of human 

72
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:56,500
humanness,
of consciousness that you discovered.

73
00:03:56,510 --> 00:04:01,510
So I just wanted to ask,
can you look back in your childhood and 

74
00:04:01,510 --> 00:04:04,970
remember when was the first time you 
realized you yourself sort of form a 

75
00:04:04,970 --> 00:04:09,900
third person perspective or our 
conscious being this idea of no stepping

76
00:04:11,971 --> 00:04:16,971
outside of yourself and seeing there's 
something special going on here in my 

77
00:04:16,971 --> 00:04:16,971
brain.

78
00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:19,660
I can't really accurate.
It's a good question.

79
00:04:19,661 --> 00:04:24,661
I'm not sure I recall a discreet moment.
I mean you take it for granted because 

80
00:04:24,661 --> 00:04:29,011
that's the only world you know.
The only world I know you know is the 

81
00:04:29,011 --> 00:04:32,971
world of seeing and hearing voices and 
touching and all the other thing,

82
00:04:33,591 --> 00:04:38,450
so it's only much later at early in my 
undergrad days when I became,

83
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:43,880
when I enrolled in physics and in 
philosophy that I really thought about 

84
00:04:43,880 --> 00:04:43,880
it and thought,
well,

85
00:04:43,880 --> 00:04:47,400
this is really fundamentally very,
very mysterious and there's nothing 

86
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:51,001
really in physics right now that 
explains this transition from the 

87
00:04:51,001 --> 00:04:54,361
physics of the brain to feelings.
Where do the feelings come in until you 

88
00:04:54,361 --> 00:04:56,320
can look at the foundational equation of
quantum mechanics,

89
00:04:56,530 --> 00:05:01,530
general relativity.
You can look at the period table of the 

90
00:05:01,530 --> 00:05:04,021
elements.
You can look at the endless atg seat 

91
00:05:04,021 --> 00:05:05,530
chat and our genes and no is 
consciousness.

92
00:05:05,531 --> 00:05:10,531
Yet I wake up every morning to a world 
where I have experiences and so that's 

93
00:05:10,531 --> 00:05:12,520
the hub of the ancient mind body 
problem.

94
00:05:12,521 --> 00:05:17,521
How do explain to get into the world?
So what is consciousness,

95
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:23,170
experience consciousness as any,
any con,

96
00:05:23,290 --> 00:05:26,350
any experience?
Some people call it subjective feelings,

97
00:05:26,360 --> 00:05:29,340
some people call it a phenomenon,
phenomenology,

98
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:31,390
some people call it quality of their 
philosophy,

99
00:05:31,420 --> 00:05:36,420
but they all did note the same thing.
It feels like something in the famous 

100
00:05:36,420 --> 00:05:39,961
word for the philosopher Thomas Nagel.
It feels like something to be a bad or 

101
00:05:39,961 --> 00:05:42,420
to be a,
uh,

102
00:05:42,740 --> 00:05:47,650
an American or to be angry or to be sad 
or to be in love or to have pain

103
00:05:49,140 --> 00:05:54,140
and that is what experience is.
Any possible experience could be as 

104
00:05:54,140 --> 00:05:56,690
mundane as just sitting in a chair could
be as excited as,

105
00:05:56,970 --> 00:05:58,700
you know,
having a mystical moment,

106
00:05:58,760 --> 00:05:59,630
uh,
you know,

107
00:05:59,780 --> 00:06:01,120
in,
in deep meditation,

108
00:06:01,121 --> 00:06:03,140
those also just different forms of 
experiences,

109
00:06:03,250 --> 00:06:08,250
experience.
So if you were to sit down with maybe 

110
00:06:08,250 --> 00:06:12,691
the next,
skip a couple of generations of Ibm 

111
00:06:12,691 --> 00:06:12,880
Watson,
something that won jeopardy,

112
00:06:13,030 --> 00:06:16,720
what is the gap?
I guess the question is between Watson,

113
00:06:17,710 --> 00:06:22,710
uh,
that might be a much smarter than you 

114
00:06:22,710 --> 00:06:25,320
than us,
than all any human alive but may not 

115
00:06:25,320 --> 00:06:26,950
have experience.
What is the gap?

116
00:06:28,420 --> 00:06:29,680
Well,
so that's a big,

117
00:06:29,681 --> 00:06:32,110
big question that's occupy people for 
the last,

118
00:06:32,680 --> 00:06:36,190
certainly the last 50 years since we,
since the advent,

119
00:06:36,220 --> 00:06:41,220
the birth of have a computer question 
and chilling title answer and of course 

120
00:06:41,241 --> 00:06:46,241
he did it in this indirect way by 
proposing it's tests and operational 

121
00:06:46,241 --> 00:06:46,241
tests.
So,

122
00:06:46,241 --> 00:06:48,220
but that's not really,
that's,

123
00:06:48,290 --> 00:06:49,340
you know,
he tried to get it.

124
00:06:49,341 --> 00:06:54,341
What does it mean for a person to think 
and then he had this test that you lock 

125
00:06:54,341 --> 00:06:58,061
them away and then you have a 
communication with them and then you 

126
00:06:58,061 --> 00:07:00,660
title to guess after a whether that is a
personal or whether it's a computer 

127
00:07:00,660 --> 00:07:04,781
system.
There's no question that now or very 

128
00:07:04,781 --> 00:07:04,781
soon,
you know,

129
00:07:04,781 --> 00:07:08,021
Alexa or Siri or Google,
now we'll pass this test and you can 

130
00:07:08,021 --> 00:07:08,890
game it.
But you know,

131
00:07:08,900 --> 00:07:13,900
ultimately,
certainly in your generation there will 

132
00:07:13,900 --> 00:07:17,351
be machines that will speak with 
complete poise that will remember 

133
00:07:17,351 --> 00:07:17,351
everything you've ever said that.

134
00:07:17,351 --> 00:07:20,130
Remember every email you ever had like 
Samantha,

135
00:07:20,131 --> 00:07:25,131
remember in the movie her.
It's no question it's going to have a 

136
00:07:25,131 --> 00:07:28,300
happen,
but of course the key question is it 

137
00:07:28,300 --> 00:07:30,671
doesn't feel like anything to be 
Samantha in the movie her or does it 

138
00:07:30,671 --> 00:07:33,830
feel like anything to be Watson and 
there one has to be very,

139
00:07:34,460 --> 00:07:39,460
very strongly think they're two 
different concepts here that we call 

140
00:07:39,460 --> 00:07:40,850
mingle.
There is a concept of intelligence,

141
00:07:41,330 --> 00:07:46,330
natural or artificial,
and there is a concept of consciousness 

142
00:07:46,330 --> 00:07:47,270
of experience,
natural or artificial.

143
00:07:47,271 --> 00:07:49,040
Those are very,
very different things.

144
00:07:49,670 --> 00:07:53,060
Now historically with associate 
consciousness was intelligence.

145
00:07:53,061 --> 00:07:56,180
Why?
Because we live in a world leaving aside

146
00:07:56,181 --> 00:08:00,560
computers of of natural selection where 
we're surrounded by creatures,

147
00:08:00,561 --> 00:08:05,300
either our own kin that are less or more
intelligent or we go costs feces.

148
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:10,360
Some.
Some are more adapted to particular 

149
00:08:10,360 --> 00:08:10,360
environment.
Others unless adapted,

150
00:08:10,360 --> 00:08:13,660
whether it's a whale or a dog or you go 
talk to him or a little worm,

151
00:08:14,480 --> 00:08:19,480
and we see the complexity of the nervous
system goes from one cell to two,

152
00:08:19,790 --> 00:08:24,170
a specialized cells to a worm that has 
been at that has 30 percent of its cells

153
00:08:24,171 --> 00:08:29,171
and nerve cells to creature like us or 
like a blue whale that have had 100 

154
00:08:29,171 --> 00:08:33,730
billion nerve cells and so based on 
behavioral evidence and based on the 

155
00:08:33,730 --> 00:08:38,141
underlying neuroscience,
we believe that as his creatures become 

156
00:08:38,141 --> 00:08:42,101
more complex,
they are better adapted to their 

157
00:08:42,101 --> 00:08:45,521
particular ecological niche and they 
become more conscious partly because 

158
00:08:45,531 --> 00:08:47,720
their brain calls and we believe 
consciousness,

159
00:08:47,721 --> 00:08:52,721
unlike the ancient ancient people 
thought most almost every culture 

160
00:08:52,721 --> 00:08:56,351
thought that consciousness was 
intelligence has to do with your heart 

161
00:08:56,351 --> 00:08:56,880
and you still see that today.

162
00:08:56,880 --> 00:08:57,480
You see,
honey,

163
00:08:57,481 --> 00:09:00,600
I love you with all my house,
but what you should actually say,

164
00:09:00,650 --> 00:09:01,410
you say,
no honey,

165
00:09:01,411 --> 00:09:05,460
I love you was all my lateral 
hypothalamus and for Valentine's Day you

166
00:09:05,461 --> 00:09:07,060
should give you a sweetheart,
a,

167
00:09:07,100 --> 00:09:12,100
you know,
a hypothalamic shame piece of chocolate 

168
00:09:12,100 --> 00:09:12,100
and not a hardship chocolate.
Right?

169
00:09:12,100 --> 00:09:17,080
So we still have this language,
but now we believe it's a brain and so 

170
00:09:17,080 --> 00:09:17,080
we see brains of different complexity 
and we think,

171
00:09:17,080 --> 00:09:21,891
well,
they have different levels of 

172
00:09:21,891 --> 00:09:22,200
consciousness that capable of different 
experiences.

173
00:09:22,620 --> 00:09:27,620
Um,
but now we confront a world where we 

174
00:09:27,620 --> 00:09:32,511
know where we're beginning to engineer 
intelligence and it's graphical,

175
00:09:33,030 --> 00:09:38,030
unclear whether the intelligence we 
engineering has anything to do with 

176
00:09:38,030 --> 00:09:42,171
consciousness and whether it can 
experience anything because 

177
00:09:42,171 --> 00:09:42,990
fundamentally what's the difference?
Intelligence.

178
00:09:42,991 --> 00:09:46,440
It's about function intelligence,
no matter exactly how you define it,

179
00:09:46,441 --> 00:09:51,441
sort of adaptation to new environments.
Being able to learn and quickly 

180
00:09:51,441 --> 00:09:55,431
understand the setup of this and what's 
going on and who the actors and what's 

181
00:09:55,431 --> 00:09:56,940
going to happen next.
It's all about function.

182
00:09:57,570 --> 00:10:00,890
Consciousness is not about function 
consciousness,

183
00:10:00,891 --> 00:10:04,200
it's about being in some sense,
much fundamental.

184
00:10:05,560 --> 00:10:08,710
You can see folks that,
you can see this in several cases.

185
00:10:08,711 --> 00:10:09,820
You can see it.
For instance,

186
00:10:09,821 --> 00:10:14,821
in the case of the clinic,
when you're dealing with patients who 

187
00:10:14,821 --> 00:10:16,810
are,
let's say had a stoke or had one traffic

188
00:10:16,811 --> 00:10:18,030
accident,
etc.

189
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:20,780
They're pretty much immobile.
Terry shy boy,

190
00:10:21,250 --> 00:10:26,250
you may have heard historically,
she was a person here in the in the 

191
00:10:26,250 --> 00:10:27,540
nineties and Florida judge heart stood 
still.

192
00:10:27,541 --> 00:10:31,530
She was really animated and for the next
14 years she was in a vegetative state,

193
00:10:32,130 --> 00:10:33,930
so there's thousands of people in a 
vegetative state,

194
00:10:33,931 --> 00:10:34,770
so they're,
you know,

195
00:10:34,780 --> 00:10:35,620
they are,
you know,

196
00:10:35,640 --> 00:10:40,640
they're like this.
Occasionally they opened the eyes for 

197
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:40,640
two,
three,

198
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:40,640
four,
five,

199
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:41,140
six,
eight hours and then close the eyes.

200
00:10:41,141 --> 00:10:42,360
They have sleep,
wake cycle.

201
00:10:42,870 --> 00:10:47,870
Occasionally they have behavior they do,
but there's no way that you can 

202
00:10:48,751 --> 00:10:53,751
establish a lawful relationship between 
what you say or the doctor says or the 

203
00:10:53,751 --> 00:10:55,830
mom says and what the patient does.
So,

204
00:10:56,040 --> 00:10:57,960
so the.
So the.

205
00:10:57,990 --> 00:11:00,810
There isn't any behavior.
Get in some of these people.

206
00:11:00,811 --> 00:11:02,760
There is still experience.
You can,

207
00:11:03,020 --> 00:11:08,020
you can design and build brain machine 
interfaces where you can see there's 

208
00:11:08,020 --> 00:11:12,950
still experienced something and of 
course that these cases have blocked in 

209
00:11:12,950 --> 00:11:12,950
state.

210
00:11:12,950 --> 00:11:14,730
There's a famous book called the diving 
bell and the butterfly.

211
00:11:15,210 --> 00:11:17,060
Well,
you had an ediTor to edit a year.

212
00:11:17,061 --> 00:11:22,050
The stoke in the in the brain stem,
unable to move except his vertical eyes,

213
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:25,260
eye movement.
he could just move his eyes up and down.

214
00:11:25,261 --> 00:11:30,210
When you dictated an entire book and 
some people even lose this at the end it

215
00:11:30,211 --> 00:11:33,300
all the evidence seems to suggest that 
they're still in there.

216
00:11:33,520 --> 00:11:35,820
In this case,
you have no behavior.

217
00:11:35,850 --> 00:11:38,610
You have consciousness.
Second cases tonight,

218
00:11:38,670 --> 00:11:40,530
like all of us,
you're going to go to sleep,

219
00:11:41,100 --> 00:11:42,480
close your eyes,
you go to sleep.

220
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:47,720
You will wake up inside your sleeping 
body and you will have conscious 

221
00:11:47,720 --> 00:11:49,800
experiences are different from everyday 
experience.

222
00:11:49,801 --> 00:11:54,801
You might fly.
You might not be surprised that you're 

223
00:11:54,801 --> 00:11:55,120
flying.
You might meet a long dead pet childhood

224
00:11:55,121 --> 00:11:57,940
dog and you're not surprised that you're
meeting them,

225
00:11:57,941 --> 00:12:02,941
you know,
but you have conscious experience of 

226
00:12:02,941 --> 00:12:02,941
love,
of hates.

227
00:12:02,941 --> 00:12:03,670
You know they can be very emotional.
Your body during this state,

228
00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:08,680
it typically to them state sends an 
active signal to your motor neurons to 

229
00:12:08,680 --> 00:12:13,501
paralyze you.
it's called tanya because if you don't 

230
00:12:13,501 --> 00:12:13,720
have that,
like some patients,

231
00:12:13,721 --> 00:12:15,490
what do you do?
You act out your dreams.

232
00:12:15,550 --> 00:12:18,010
You get proximal behavioral disorder,
which is about,

233
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:20,150
which is bad juju to get.
Okay.

234
00:12:20,620 --> 00:12:23,860
Sad case is pure experience.
so I recently had this,

235
00:12:25,060 --> 00:12:27,310
what some people call it mystical 
experience.

236
00:12:27,460 --> 00:12:30,100
I went to Singapore and went into 
flotation tank,

237
00:12:30,810 --> 00:12:35,810
right?
So this is a big tub filled was with 

238
00:12:35,810 --> 00:12:37,450
water.
That's body temperature and epsom salt.

239
00:12:37,720 --> 00:12:39,290
You strip completely naked,
july,

240
00:12:39,310 --> 00:12:41,080
inside of it,
you close the lid,

241
00:12:41,140 --> 00:12:43,120
darkness,
complete darkness,

242
00:12:43,590 --> 00:12:48,590
soundproof.
So very quickly you become body less 

243
00:12:48,590 --> 00:12:48,590
because you're floating and you're 
naked.

244
00:12:48,590 --> 00:12:49,720
You have no rings,
no watch,

245
00:12:49,721 --> 00:12:51,790
no nothing.
You don't feel your body anymore.

246
00:12:52,920 --> 00:12:56,320
No sound soundless.
There's no a photon,

247
00:12:56,660 --> 00:13:00,020
a sightless timeless because after a 
while,

248
00:13:00,070 --> 00:13:01,720
early on,
you're actually hear your heart,

249
00:13:02,260 --> 00:13:06,460
but then that you sort of adapt to that 
and then sort oF the pathogen of time,

250
00:13:06,461 --> 00:13:09,670
csus,
and if you train yourself like in a,

251
00:13:09,671 --> 00:13:11,620
in a meditation,
not to sleep early on,

252
00:13:11,621 --> 00:13:13,510
you think a lot,
it's a little bit spooky,

253
00:13:13,511 --> 00:13:15,340
you feel somewhat uncomfortable or you 
think,

254
00:13:15,341 --> 00:13:16,420
well,
I'm going to get bored,

255
00:13:16,870 --> 00:13:19,990
but if your title not to think actively,
you become mindless.

256
00:13:20,200 --> 00:13:22,540
So there you are.
Body less timeless.

257
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:27,940
Soundless sightless mindless.
But you're in a conscious experience,

258
00:13:27,941 --> 00:13:29,770
you're not asleep,
you're not asleep,

259
00:13:29,780 --> 00:13:30,250
you're,
you,

260
00:13:30,460 --> 00:13:33,580
you are being a pure,
pure being.

261
00:13:33,581 --> 00:13:36,220
There isn't any function.
You aren't doing any computation,

262
00:13:36,221 --> 00:13:37,930
you're not remembering,
you're not projecting,

263
00:13:37,931 --> 00:13:40,510
you're not planning yet.
You are fully conscious,

264
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:42,850
fully conscious.
There is something going out there.

265
00:13:42,850 --> 00:13:45,070
It could be just a side effect.
So what is the,

266
00:13:45,071 --> 00:13:49,060
the epi phenomenon.
So what is the select effect?

267
00:13:49,450 --> 00:13:51,570
Meaning why?
Uh,

268
00:13:51,990 --> 00:13:52,550
what,
what,

269
00:13:52,551 --> 00:13:57,130
what is the function of you being able 
to lay in this sense,

270
00:13:57,160 --> 00:14:00,880
sensory free deprivation tank and still 
have a conscious experience?

271
00:14:02,620 --> 00:14:06,430
Obviously we didn't evolve with 
flotation tanks in our environment.

272
00:14:06,740 --> 00:14:11,740
I mean,
so biology is notoriously bad at asking 

273
00:14:11,740 --> 00:14:11,740
why.
Question anomic question,

274
00:14:11,740 --> 00:14:14,920
why do we have two eyes?
Why don't we have four or three hours or

275
00:14:14,921 --> 00:14:15,550
something?
Well,

276
00:14:15,551 --> 00:14:16,800
no,
there's probably a bit.

277
00:14:16,820 --> 00:14:18,690
It'S a function to that,
but it's,

278
00:14:18,910 --> 00:14:21,130
we're not very good at answering those 
questions.

279
00:14:21,131 --> 00:14:26,131
We can speculate.
And leslie were biologists or 

280
00:14:26,131 --> 00:14:26,131
scientists,
very good about mechanistic question,

281
00:14:26,131 --> 00:14:27,140
why they're charging the universe,
right?

282
00:14:27,310 --> 00:14:29,860
We find the universe were there positive
and negative charges.

283
00:14:29,861 --> 00:14:32,290
Why?
Why does quantum mechanics hall?

284
00:14:32,940 --> 00:14:33,410
you know,
why,

285
00:14:33,450 --> 00:14:35,590
why,
why doesn't some other theory,

286
00:14:35,800 --> 00:14:38,970
quantum mechanics in our university?
It's very unclear why so tiller,

287
00:14:39,010 --> 00:14:41,620
comical question,
why questions are difficult to answer.

288
00:14:41,621 --> 00:14:45,160
Clearly there's some relationship 
between complexity,

289
00:14:45,340 --> 00:14:47,470
brain processing,
power and consciousness,

290
00:14:48,640 --> 00:14:50,380
but however,
in these cases,

291
00:14:50,381 --> 00:14:54,320
in these three that I gave,
one is an everyday experience at night.

292
00:14:54,321 --> 00:14:57,320
The other one is a tom on third one is 
in principle.

293
00:14:57,321 --> 00:15:02,321
You can.
Everybody can have these sort of 

294
00:15:02,321 --> 00:15:03,860
mystical experiences.
You have a dissociation of function form

295
00:15:03,950 --> 00:15:05,870
of intelligence from

296
00:15:06,450 --> 00:15:11,450
I'm from conscious and unconscious.
This you caught me asking a why 

297
00:15:11,450 --> 00:15:15,590
question.
Let me ask a question that's not a why 

298
00:15:15,590 --> 00:15:19,071
question.
You're giving a talk later today on the 

299
00:15:19,071 --> 00:15:21,180
turing test for intelligence and causes 
a drawn lines between the two.

300
00:15:21,181 --> 00:15:26,181
So is there a scientific way to say 
there's consciousness present in this 

301
00:15:26,181 --> 00:15:30,921
entity or not?
And to anticipate your answer because 

302
00:15:31,110 --> 00:15:33,930
you will also.
There's a neuro biological answer.

303
00:15:34,110 --> 00:15:37,500
So we test the human brain,
but if you take a machine brain that you

304
00:15:37,501 --> 00:15:42,501
don't know tests for yet a,
how would you even begin to approach a 

305
00:15:43,171 --> 00:15:45,900
test of their consciousness precedent in
this thing?

306
00:15:46,310 --> 00:15:47,660
Okay,
that's a really good question.

307
00:15:47,661 --> 00:15:52,661
So let me take two steps.
So as you point out for for four months,

308
00:15:53,111 --> 00:15:56,580
let's just stick with humans.
There's now a test called a zap unzip.

309
00:15:56,600 --> 00:16:01,600
It's a procedure where you ping the 
brain using transcranial magnetic 

310
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:04,781
stimulation,
you look at the electrical 

311
00:16:04,781 --> 00:16:07,331
reverberations essentially using egg and
then you can measure the complexity of 

312
00:16:07,331 --> 00:16:08,890
this brain response and you can do this 
in a weight.

313
00:16:08,891 --> 00:16:10,790
People in asleep sleep,
normal people.

314
00:16:10,791 --> 00:16:13,670
You can do it in a wake people up and 
then anesthetize them.

315
00:16:13,671 --> 00:16:18,671
you can do it in patients and it it,
it has a hundred percent accuracy that 

316
00:16:18,790 --> 00:16:23,790
in all those cases when you're clear the
patient or the person that either 

317
00:16:23,790 --> 00:16:26,801
conscious or unconscious a complexity 
either high or low and then you can 

318
00:16:26,801 --> 00:16:28,420
adopt these techniques to similar 
creatures like monkeys and dogs and,

319
00:16:28,421 --> 00:16:30,920
and,
and mindset have very similar planes.

320
00:16:31,970 --> 00:16:36,970
Now of course you,
you point out that may not help you 

321
00:16:36,970 --> 00:16:36,970
because we don't have a context,
you know,

322
00:16:36,970 --> 00:16:39,650
and if I send them magnetic pulse into 
my iphone or my computer,

323
00:16:39,651 --> 00:16:41,040
it's probably going to break something.
Yeah.

324
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:43,010
So we don't have that.
so what we need,

325
00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:43,820
ultimately,

326
00:16:45,310 --> 00:16:49,240
we need a theory of consciousness.
We can just align our intuition,

327
00:16:49,241 --> 00:16:50,440
our intuition as well.
Yeah.

328
00:16:50,441 --> 00:16:52,570
If somebody talks,
they're conscious,

329
00:16:52,830 --> 00:16:53,620
right?
However,

330
00:16:53,621 --> 00:16:56,170
then they all these children,
babies don't talk.

331
00:16:56,200 --> 00:16:58,180
Right?
But we believe that that,

332
00:16:58,270 --> 00:17:00,640
that baby's also have conscious 
experiences.

333
00:17:00,641 --> 00:17:05,641
Right?
And then there are all these patients I 

334
00:17:05,641 --> 00:17:05,641
mentioned and they don't talk.
When you dream,

335
00:17:05,641 --> 00:17:07,300
you can't talk because you're paralyzed.
So.

336
00:17:07,630 --> 00:17:09,100
So what?
What we ultimately need,

337
00:17:09,130 --> 00:17:14,130
we can't just rely on our intuition.
We need a theory of content that tells 

338
00:17:14,130 --> 00:17:18,151
us what is it about a piece of matter?
What is it about a piece of highly 

339
00:17:18,151 --> 00:17:19,750
excitable map?
I like the brain or like a computer that

340
00:17:19,751 --> 00:17:22,480
gives rise to conscious experience.
We all believe,

341
00:17:22,510 --> 00:17:24,280
none of us believe that anymore in the 
old story.

342
00:17:24,281 --> 00:17:29,281
It's a soul that used to be the most 
common explanation that most people 

343
00:17:29,281 --> 00:17:29,281
accept it.

344
00:17:29,281 --> 00:17:32,010
And still a lot of people today believe,
well there's god endowed.

345
00:17:32,110 --> 00:17:35,350
Only asked was his special thing that 
animals don't have.

346
00:17:35,380 --> 00:17:36,700
They need to call.
Famously said,

347
00:17:36,910 --> 00:17:38,380
dog,
if you hit it with your,

348
00:17:38,381 --> 00:17:41,800
catch me yell at me,
but it doesn't have this special thing.

349
00:17:41,801 --> 00:17:43,720
It doesn't have the magic,
the magic sauce.

350
00:17:44,920 --> 00:17:49,920
It doesn't have guys downstairs.
So now we believe that isn't the case 

351
00:17:49,920 --> 00:17:51,720
anymore.
So what is the difference between brains

352
00:17:51,810 --> 00:17:53,520
and,
and these guys?

353
00:17:53,580 --> 00:17:58,580
Silicon and um,
in particular once their behavior 

354
00:17:58,580 --> 00:17:59,100
matches.
So if you have siri,

355
00:17:59,101 --> 00:18:04,101
you have alexa in 20 years from now that
she can talk just as good as any 

356
00:18:04,101 --> 00:18:05,970
possible schumann,
what counts do you have to say?

357
00:18:06,090 --> 00:18:08,200
She's not conscious in particular.
If she says,

358
00:18:08,201 --> 00:18:11,950
as I've caught,
you will cause I'm conscious you also,

359
00:18:11,960 --> 00:18:13,080
what are you doing?
and she'll say,

360
00:18:13,081 --> 00:18:13,950
well,
you know,

361
00:18:14,030 --> 00:18:17,260
they,
they'll generate some way to cost she,

362
00:18:17,300 --> 00:18:19,380
she'll behave like a,
like a person.

363
00:18:19,770 --> 00:18:22,170
Now there's several differences.
One is,

364
00:18:23,490 --> 00:18:26,110
so this relates to the problem,
the very hot.

365
00:18:26,200 --> 00:18:30,150
Why is consciousness a hard problem?
It's because it's subjective,

366
00:18:30,210 --> 00:18:32,180
right?
Only I have it for one.

367
00:18:32,220 --> 00:18:36,120
I know I have direct experience of my 
own consciousness.

368
00:18:36,510 --> 00:18:38,940
I don't have eczema.
And your consciousness now,

369
00:18:38,941 --> 00:18:43,941
I assume as a sort of a bayesian 
personal believes in probability theory 

370
00:18:43,941 --> 00:18:43,941
in all of that,
you know,

371
00:18:43,941 --> 00:18:45,180
I can do,
I can do an abduction to the,

372
00:18:45,210 --> 00:18:48,870
to the best available tax I did use.
Your brain is very similar to mine.

373
00:18:48,871 --> 00:18:53,871
If I put you in a scanner,
your brain is going to behave the same 

374
00:18:53,871 --> 00:18:53,871
with I do.
If,

375
00:18:53,871 --> 00:18:54,070
if,
if you know,

376
00:18:54,090 --> 00:18:56,430
if I gave you this muesli and ask you 
how does it taste?

377
00:18:56,431 --> 00:18:58,020
You tell me things that you know,
that,

378
00:18:58,350 --> 00:19:00,210
that I would also say more or less 
higher.

379
00:19:00,360 --> 00:19:03,150
So infer based on all of them that your 
conscious now it was silly.

380
00:19:03,151 --> 00:19:08,151
I can't do that.
So there I really need a theory that 

381
00:19:08,151 --> 00:19:09,090
tells me what is it about,
about any system,

382
00:19:09,091 --> 00:19:10,740
this or this.
It makes it conscious.

383
00:19:11,140 --> 00:19:12,450
We have such a theory.

384
00:19:12,530 --> 00:19:15,020
Yes.
So the integrated information theory,

385
00:19:15,680 --> 00:19:20,680
but let me first maybe as an 
introduction for people who are not 

386
00:19:20,680 --> 00:19:20,680
familiar,
the car.

387
00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:25,720
Can yOu talk a lot about panpsychism?
can you describe what a physicalism 

388
00:19:27,710 --> 00:19:29,380
versus dualism?
The.

389
00:19:29,510 --> 00:19:33,230
You mentioned the soul.
What is the history of that idea?

390
00:19:33,330 --> 00:19:36,240
What is the idea of penn psychosis or.
No,

391
00:19:36,290 --> 00:19:41,290
the debate really out of which 
panpsychism can emerge of,

392
00:19:41,390 --> 00:19:42,250
of,
of,

393
00:19:42,251 --> 00:19:47,251
um,
dualism versus a physicalism or do you 

394
00:19:47,251 --> 00:19:49,400
not see a panpsychism as fitting into 
that?

395
00:19:49,840 --> 00:19:51,630
No,
you can argue there's some older.

396
00:19:51,660 --> 00:19:52,570
Okay.
So let's step back.

397
00:19:52,571 --> 00:19:57,571
So panpsychism is a very ancient belief 
that's been around a plato and aristotle

398
00:19:57,910 --> 00:20:01,000
talks about it.
A modern philosophers talk about it.

399
00:20:01,480 --> 00:20:04,930
Of course in buddhism the idea is very 
prevalent that,

400
00:20:05,160 --> 00:20:10,160
I mean the different versions of it.
one version says everything is 

401
00:20:10,160 --> 00:20:10,160
installed.
Everything,

402
00:20:10,160 --> 00:20:13,030
rocks and stones and dogs and people and
foremost an iphone.

403
00:20:13,060 --> 00:20:14,560
All of her soul.
I'd all,

404
00:20:14,570 --> 00:20:16,690
matt is in seoul.
That's sort of one version.

405
00:20:16,870 --> 00:20:21,870
Another version is that all biology,
all creatures smaller,

406
00:20:22,061 --> 00:20:27,061
large from a single cell to a giant 
quietly feel like something that's the 

407
00:20:27,061 --> 00:20:28,750
one I think is somewhat more realistic.
Um,

408
00:20:29,140 --> 00:20:31,390
so they're different.
What do you mean by feel like something?

409
00:20:31,470 --> 00:20:34,370
I have a feeling,
have some kind of like,

410
00:20:34,490 --> 00:20:39,490
some,
it may well be possible that it feels 

411
00:20:39,490 --> 00:20:39,490
like something to be a power medium.

412
00:20:39,490 --> 00:20:43,810
I think it's pretty likely it feels like
something to be a b or a mouse or dog.

413
00:20:45,500 --> 00:20:46,160
Sure.
So,

414
00:20:46,161 --> 00:20:47,150
okay,
so,

415
00:20:47,170 --> 00:20:52,170
so that you can see that's also.
So pam is very broad and you can some 

416
00:20:52,421 --> 00:20:53,740
people,
for example,

417
00:20:53,770 --> 00:20:58,770
a proton mccastle try to advocate this.
This idea is called alien monism that,

418
00:21:00,220 --> 00:21:04,060
that panpsychism is really physics 
viewed from the inside.

419
00:21:05,080 --> 00:21:09,790
So the idea is that physics is very good
at describing relationship among objects

420
00:21:09,791 --> 00:21:13,150
like charges or like gravity,
you know,

421
00:21:13,240 --> 00:21:16,150
this relationship between curvature and 
mass distribution.

422
00:21:16,151 --> 00:21:17,890
Okay.
That's the relationship among things.

423
00:21:18,130 --> 00:21:20,920
Physics doesn't really discard the 
ultimate reality itself.

424
00:21:20,921 --> 00:21:25,490
It's just relationship among quarks or 
all these other stuff was sort of like a

425
00:21:25,590 --> 00:21:28,150
third observer.
Yes.

426
00:21:28,990 --> 00:21:33,990
And consciousness is what physics feels 
on the inside to my conscious 

427
00:21:33,990 --> 00:21:35,800
experience.
It's a way that physics of my brain,

428
00:21:35,801 --> 00:21:37,930
particular my cortex feels from the 
inside.

429
00:21:38,500 --> 00:21:42,090
And so if you meet them,
you to remember you say panamanian,

430
00:21:42,100 --> 00:21:47,100
well that's a pretty dumb creature this,
but it has already a billion different 

431
00:21:47,100 --> 00:21:48,920
molecules probably,
you know,

432
00:21:48,970 --> 00:21:51,790
5,000
different proteins assemble in a highly,

433
00:21:51,791 --> 00:21:54,310
highly complex system that no single 
person,

434
00:21:54,311 --> 00:21:59,311
no computer system so far on this planet
has ever managed to accurately simulate 

435
00:21:59,311 --> 00:22:00,940
its complexity.
Vastly escapes us.

436
00:22:01,210 --> 00:22:06,210
Yes.
And it may well be that that little 

437
00:22:06,210 --> 00:22:06,210
thing feels like a tiny bit.
No,

438
00:22:06,210 --> 00:22:06,520
it doesn't have a voice in their head 
like me.

439
00:22:06,521 --> 00:22:08,530
It doesn't have expectations,
you know,

440
00:22:08,531 --> 00:22:12,370
it doesn't have all that complex things,
but it may well feel like something.

441
00:22:12,490 --> 00:22:14,260
Yeah.
So This is really interesting.

442
00:22:14,680 --> 00:22:19,680
Can we draw some lines and maybe try to 
understand the difference between life 

443
00:22:20,200 --> 00:22:24,790
intelligence and consciousness.
How do you see all of those?

444
00:22:25,160 --> 00:22:28,360
If she has to define what is a living 
thing,

445
00:22:28,510 --> 00:22:31,480
what is a conscious thing and what is an
intelligent thing?

446
00:22:31,480 --> 00:22:34,800
Do those intermix for you?
Or are they totally separate or.

447
00:22:34,801 --> 00:22:35,340
Okay.
So a,

448
00:22:35,370 --> 00:22:37,240
that's a question that we don't have a 
full.

449
00:22:37,330 --> 00:22:41,110
And a lot of this stuff we're talking 
about today is full of mysteries.

450
00:22:41,111 --> 00:22:42,540
And fascinating ones,
right it,

451
00:22:42,541 --> 00:22:47,541
while the approximately you can go to 
other startle who's probably the most 

452
00:22:47,541 --> 00:22:48,220
important scientists and philosophers 
ever lived in.

453
00:22:48,250 --> 00:22:50,680
Certainly in western culture.
He had this idea,

454
00:22:50,681 --> 00:22:53,760
it's called hylomorphism.
It's quite popular these days that there

455
00:22:53,761 --> 00:22:56,770
are different forms of soul.
The soul is really the form of something

456
00:22:56,771 --> 00:22:57,880
he saw.
He says,

457
00:22:58,210 --> 00:23:03,210
all biological kj have a vegetive soul.
That's life principle today we think we 

458
00:23:03,210 --> 00:23:07,561
understand something molded it's 
biochemistry and nonlinear 

459
00:23:07,561 --> 00:23:07,561
thermodynamics,
right?

460
00:23:07,561 --> 00:23:12,240
Then he said they have a sensitive,
so only animals and humans have also a 

461
00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:15,670
sensitive soul or an appetitive soul.
They can see,

462
00:23:15,671 --> 00:23:17,890
they can smell and they have drives.

463
00:23:18,160 --> 00:23:19,100
They wanted tO put,
reproduce,

464
00:23:19,140 --> 00:23:20,510
they want to eat,
et cetera,

465
00:23:20,860 --> 00:23:24,220
and then only humans have what he called
a rational soul.

466
00:23:25,090 --> 00:23:30,090
Okay.
And that idea that made it into 

467
00:23:30,090 --> 00:23:30,760
christian dome and then the rational 
soul is the one that lives forever.

468
00:23:30,761 --> 00:23:32,350
He was very unclear.
he wasn't really,

469
00:23:32,740 --> 00:23:37,740
I mean different readings or virustotal 
give different what that did he believe 

470
00:23:37,740 --> 00:23:38,140
that international show was a model or 
not,

471
00:23:38,141 --> 00:23:43,141
but I probably think he didn't,
but then of course had made it into a 

472
00:23:43,141 --> 00:23:46,310
play to under christianity and then this
all became immortal and then became the 

473
00:23:46,310 --> 00:23:48,220
the connection to god.
Now you,

474
00:23:48,350 --> 00:23:51,860
so you were asking me essentially,
what does our modern conception of these

475
00:23:51,920 --> 00:23:56,780
fleet aristotle would have called them 
different forms live.

476
00:23:56,810 --> 00:23:59,850
We think we know something about it,
at least live on this planet,

477
00:24:00,050 --> 00:24:01,880
although we don't understand how to 
originated,

478
00:24:01,881 --> 00:24:04,820
but it's been difficult to rigorously 
pin down.

479
00:24:05,210 --> 00:24:07,450
You see this in modern definition of 
death.

480
00:24:08,210 --> 00:24:11,120
It's the fact that I had.
Now there's a conference ongoing.

481
00:24:11,180 --> 00:24:16,180
Again,
that ties to defined legally and 

482
00:24:16,180 --> 00:24:16,180
medically.
What is death?

483
00:24:16,180 --> 00:24:17,720
It used to be very simple.
As you stop breathing,

484
00:24:17,721 --> 00:24:21,150
your heart stops beating your dad.
Totally unconverted lead.

485
00:24:21,510 --> 00:24:23,450
If you're unsure you wait another 10 
minutes.

486
00:24:23,451 --> 00:24:25,220
If the patient doesn't please,
you know he's dead.

487
00:24:25,400 --> 00:24:27,050
Well,
now we have ventilators.

488
00:24:27,230 --> 00:24:29,990
We have half of a peacemaker,
so it's much more difficult to define.

489
00:24:29,991 --> 00:24:34,991
What this is typically does is defined 
at the end of life and life has defined 

490
00:24:35,010 --> 00:24:36,920
before death before that.
Okay.

491
00:24:36,921 --> 00:24:38,930
So we don't have really very good 
definitions.

492
00:24:39,320 --> 00:24:41,780
Intelligence,
we don't have a rigorous definition.

493
00:24:41,781 --> 00:24:46,240
We know something how to measure it,
called iq or gi factors hide and,

494
00:24:46,270 --> 00:24:50,020
and we're beginning to build it in,
in a narrow sense.

495
00:24:50,021 --> 00:24:51,940
I'd like go alphago and,
and,

496
00:24:51,970 --> 00:24:54,110
and,
and watson and you know,

497
00:24:54,470 --> 00:24:56,690
google cars and uber cars and all of 
that.

498
00:24:56,691 --> 00:25:01,691
That's still now I am.
some people are thinking about 

499
00:25:01,691 --> 00:25:02,420
artificial general intelligence,
but actually as we've said before,

500
00:25:02,421 --> 00:25:06,200
it's something to do with ability to 
learn and to adapt to new environments.

501
00:25:06,470 --> 00:25:07,730
But that is,
as I said,

502
00:25:07,731 --> 00:25:12,731
also,
it's radical difference from experience 

503
00:25:12,731 --> 00:25:14,660
and it's very unclear if you build a 
machine that has agi,

504
00:25:14,690 --> 00:25:19,690
it's not at all,
not at all clear that this machine will 

505
00:25:19,690 --> 00:25:20,420
have consciousness.
It may or may not.

506
00:25:20,660 --> 00:25:22,100
So let's ask it the other way.

507
00:25:22,280 --> 00:25:27,280
Do you think if you were to try to build
an artificial general intelligence 

508
00:25:27,280 --> 00:25:27,280
system,
can you think,

509
00:25:28,030 --> 00:25:33,030
uh,
figuring out how to build artificial 

510
00:25:33,030 --> 00:25:34,650
consciousness?
What would help you get to an agi?

511
00:25:34,830 --> 00:25:39,830
So or put another way,
do you think intelligent requires 

512
00:25:39,830 --> 00:25:42,600
consciousness in shumen it goes hand in 
hand

513
00:25:43,050 --> 00:25:44,820
in shumen or.
I think in biology,

514
00:25:44,821 --> 00:25:47,400
consciousness and intelligence goes hand
in hand.

515
00:25:47,580 --> 00:25:51,900
Quite is illusion because the plane 
evolved to be highly complex.

516
00:25:51,901 --> 00:25:55,680
Complexity via this theory,
integrated information theory is sort of

517
00:25:55,681 --> 00:25:58,950
ultimately is what is closely tied to 
consciousness.

518
00:25:59,250 --> 00:26:04,250
Ultimately it's causal power upon itself
and so in evolution evolved systems ego 

519
00:26:04,250 --> 00:26:07,710
together in artificial system,
particularly in digital machines,

520
00:26:07,740 --> 00:26:09,960
they do not go together and if you ask 
me,

521
00:26:09,961 --> 00:26:13,620
point blank is alexa 20 point,
oh,

522
00:26:13,630 --> 00:26:15,480
in the year 20,
41,

523
00:26:15,481 --> 00:26:17,470
she can easily pass every two 
intestines.

524
00:26:17,490 --> 00:26:20,540
She conscious no.
Even if she claims she's concert.

525
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:26,000
In fact,
you could even do more radical version 

526
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:27,861
of this thought experiment.
We can build a computer simulation of 

527
00:26:27,861 --> 00:26:31,041
the human brain.
you know what henry markram in the blue 

528
00:26:31,041 --> 00:26:31,230
brain project or the human brain project
in Switzerland,

529
00:26:31,231 --> 00:26:36,231
it's kind of do them all the success.
So in 10 years we have this perfect 

530
00:26:36,231 --> 00:26:36,480
simulation of the human brain.

531
00:26:36,510 --> 00:26:40,380
Every new owner stimulated and it has 
alarm makes and it has motor neuron.

532
00:26:40,381 --> 00:26:44,040
It has a pocket area and of course talk 
and they'll say,

533
00:26:44,041 --> 00:26:45,480
hi,
I just woke up.

534
00:26:45,481 --> 00:26:46,370
I feel great.
Okay.

535
00:26:46,590 --> 00:26:51,590
Even that computer simulation that can 
imprint so map onto your brain will not 

536
00:26:51,590 --> 00:26:52,050
be conscious.
Why?

537
00:26:52,140 --> 00:26:55,020
Because it simulates.
It's a difference between this simulated

538
00:26:55,021 --> 00:26:58,560
in the real,
so it simulates the behavior salted with

539
00:26:58,561 --> 00:26:59,850
consciousness.
It might be,

540
00:27:00,210 --> 00:27:01,470
it will.
If it's done properly,

541
00:27:01,471 --> 00:27:06,471
we'll have all the intelligence that 
that particular person they're 

542
00:27:06,471 --> 00:27:07,800
simulating has,
but simulating intelligence,

543
00:27:07,830 --> 00:27:11,820
it's not the same as having conscious 
experiences and I give you a really nice

544
00:27:11,821 --> 00:27:14,340
metaphor that engineers and physicists 
typically get.

545
00:27:15,240 --> 00:27:20,240
I can write down einStein's field 
equations nine or 10 equations that 

546
00:27:20,240 --> 00:27:22,950
describe the lincoln general relativity 
between curvature and and mass.

547
00:27:23,430 --> 00:27:28,430
I can do that.
I can run this on my laptop to to 

548
00:27:28,430 --> 00:27:32,090
predict that the sample,
the black hole at the center of our 

549
00:27:32,090 --> 00:27:35,301
galaxy will be so massive that it twists
space time around it so no light can 

550
00:27:36,421 --> 00:27:36,920
escape it.

551
00:27:36,940 --> 00:27:39,060
It'S a black hole,
but funny.

552
00:27:39,090 --> 00:27:44,090
have you ever wondered,
why doesn't this computer simulation 

553
00:27:44,090 --> 00:27:46,050
suck me in ict?
It simulates gravity,

554
00:27:46,200 --> 00:27:48,870
but it doesn't have the causal power of 
gravity.

555
00:27:48,900 --> 00:27:53,900
IT's a huge difference.
So it's a difference between the real 

556
00:27:53,900 --> 00:27:57,830
and the simulator,
just like it doesn't get wet inside the 

557
00:27:57,830 --> 00:28:00,951
computer when the computer code that 
similar to weather a storm and so in 

558
00:28:00,951 --> 00:28:02,920
order to have to have artificial 
continents,

559
00:28:02,930 --> 00:28:06,450
you have to give it the same.
Causal powers is human brain.

560
00:28:06,790 --> 00:28:11,790
You have to build,
took all the new amorphic machine that 

561
00:28:11,790 --> 00:28:12,480
has hardware that is very similar to the
human brain,

562
00:28:12,481 --> 00:28:13,440
not a digital

563
00:28:14,460 --> 00:28:18,270
clark for nine computer.
So that's just to clarify thouGh,

564
00:28:19,140 --> 00:28:24,140
you think that consciousness is not 
required to create human level 

565
00:28:24,661 --> 00:28:29,661
intelligence.
It seems to accompany in the human 

566
00:28:29,661 --> 00:28:30,750
brain,
but for machine not have court.

567
00:28:31,650 --> 00:28:36,650
So maybe just because this is agi.
Let's dig in a little bit about what we 

568
00:28:37,501 --> 00:28:41,980
mean by intelligence.
So one thing is the g factor,

569
00:28:42,030 --> 00:28:47,030
these kinds of iq tests of intelligence,
but I think if you maybe another way to 

570
00:28:47,030 --> 00:28:48,120
say,
so in 20,

571
00:28:48,130 --> 00:28:48,720
40,
20,

572
00:28:48,721 --> 00:28:53,700
50 people have siri that is just really 
impressive.

573
00:28:54,750 --> 00:28:57,120
Do you Think people will say series 
intelligent?

574
00:28:57,630 --> 00:28:59,100
Yes.
Intelligence.

575
00:28:59,101 --> 00:29:03,090
Is this a morphous thing?
So to be intelligent,

576
00:29:03,091 --> 00:29:08,091
it seems like you have to have some kind
of connections with other human beings 

577
00:29:08,091 --> 00:29:12,110
in a sense that you have to impress them
with your intelligence and their fields.

578
00:29:12,840 --> 00:29:17,840
You have to somehow operate in this 
world full of humans and for that there 

579
00:29:18,181 --> 00:29:21,030
feels like there has to be something 
like consciousness.

580
00:29:21,690 --> 00:29:25,620
So you think you can have just the 
world's best natural lp system,

581
00:29:25,980 --> 00:29:27,960
natural language,
understanding regeneration,

582
00:29:28,140 --> 00:29:31,440
and that will be,
that will get us happy and say,

583
00:29:31,441 --> 00:29:34,980
you know what,
we've created an agi happy.

584
00:29:37,220 --> 00:29:42,220
Yes,
I do believe we can get what we call 

585
00:29:42,220 --> 00:29:42,220
high level functional intelligence,
sort of

586
00:29:42,310 --> 00:29:42,880
the,
gee,

587
00:29:42,881 --> 00:29:43,510
you know,
this,

588
00:29:43,570 --> 00:29:47,320
this fluid like intelligence that we 
challenged,

589
00:29:47,321 --> 00:29:50,140
particularly the place like mit,
right in,

590
00:29:50,270 --> 00:29:51,280
in,
in machines.

591
00:29:51,281 --> 00:29:52,210
I see apple,
you know,

592
00:29:52,211 --> 00:29:54,880
reasons and I've see a lot of reason to 
believe it's going to happen,

593
00:29:55,170 --> 00:29:57,760
you know,
over the next 50 years or 30 years.

594
00:29:58,160 --> 00:30:01,760
So for beneficial ai for creating an ai 
system.

595
00:30:01,761 --> 00:30:06,761
That's um,
so you mentioned ethics that is 

596
00:30:06,761 --> 00:30:08,270
exceptionally intelligent but also does 
not do,

597
00:30:08,460 --> 00:30:12,620
does aligns its values with our values 
as humanity.

598
00:30:12,800 --> 00:30:14,810
Do you think then in his consciousness,

599
00:30:14,850 --> 00:30:19,850
yes.
I think that that is a verY good 

600
00:30:19,850 --> 00:30:21,530
argument that if we're concerned about 
ai and the threat of ai are nick bostrom

601
00:30:21,540 --> 00:30:22,480
existentialist,
dread.

602
00:30:22,800 --> 00:30:26,310
I think having an intelligent that has 
empathy,

603
00:30:26,970 --> 00:30:29,430
right?
Why do we find abusing a dog?

604
00:30:29,460 --> 00:30:32,580
Why do most of us find that upholland 
abusing any animal?

605
00:30:32,630 --> 00:30:34,350
I'd.
Why do we find that the holland,

606
00:30:34,351 --> 00:30:36,900
because we have this thing called 
empathy,

607
00:30:37,230 --> 00:30:41,460
which if you look at the greek really 
means feeling with I feel empathy.

608
00:30:41,461 --> 00:30:44,550
I have feeling with you.
I see somebody else suffer.

609
00:30:44,551 --> 00:30:47,430
That isn't even my conspecific I.
It's not a person.

610
00:30:47,730 --> 00:30:49,980
It's not a lot,
but it's not my wife or my kids.

611
00:30:50,040 --> 00:30:52,770
It's a dog,
but I feel naturally most of us,

612
00:30:52,771 --> 00:30:57,771
not all of us,
most of us will feel emphatic and so it 

613
00:30:57,771 --> 00:31:01,540
may well be in the longterm interest of 
survival of homo sapiens.

614
00:31:01,541 --> 00:31:06,541
Sapiens said,
if we do build agi and it's really 

615
00:31:06,541 --> 00:31:09,231
becomes very powerful that it has an 
emphatic response and doesn't just 

616
00:31:09,720 --> 00:31:12,990
exterminated humanity.
So as part of the full

617
00:31:13,120 --> 00:31:14,680
conscious experience,
uh,

618
00:31:14,800 --> 00:31:19,800
to,
to create a consciousness artificial or 

619
00:31:19,800 --> 00:31:20,990
in our human consciousness,
do you think fear,

620
00:31:21,380 --> 00:31:24,980
maybe we're going to get it into your 
earlier days in each and so on,

621
00:31:24,981 --> 00:31:28,580
but do you think fear and suffering are 
essential,

622
00:31:28,990 --> 00:31:30,620
uh,
to have consciousness?

623
00:31:30,621 --> 00:31:32,840
Do you have to have the full range of 
experience to have,

624
00:31:33,350 --> 00:31:38,350
to have a system that has experienced or
can you have a system that only has a 

625
00:31:38,581 --> 00:31:41,460
very particular kinds of very positive 
experience?

626
00:31:41,670 --> 00:31:43,750
Look you can have in Pennsylvania,
you can.

627
00:31:43,950 --> 00:31:48,950
People have done this in the vat.
Will you implanted electrodes in the 

628
00:31:48,950 --> 00:31:52,280
hypothalamus,
the pleasure center of the bat and that 

629
00:31:52,280 --> 00:31:52,910
stimulated sob above and beyond anything
else?

630
00:31:52,911 --> 00:31:57,660
It doesn't care about food or natural 
sex or drink anymore to stimulate itself

631
00:31:57,690 --> 00:32:02,690
because it's such a pleasurable feeling.
I guess it's like an orgasm just you'll 

632
00:32:02,690 --> 00:32:02,870
have,
you know,

633
00:32:02,871 --> 00:32:07,871
all day long.
And so I see no reason why you need 

634
00:32:09,140 --> 00:32:11,280
different,
why you need a great variety now.

635
00:32:11,281 --> 00:32:15,940
Clearly to survive that wouldn't work.
But if I engineered artificially,

636
00:32:16,170 --> 00:32:21,170
I don't think,
I don't think you need a great variety 

637
00:32:21,930 --> 00:32:26,930
of conscious experience.
You could have just pleasure or just 

638
00:32:26,930 --> 00:32:28,860
feel it might be a tablet systems,
but I think that's possible,

639
00:32:28,861 --> 00:32:33,120
at least on conceptual logical can cause
any real creature,

640
00:32:33,121 --> 00:32:35,300
whether artificially engineered.
Do you want to give it fear,

641
00:32:35,301 --> 00:32:38,310
the fear of extinction that we all have 
a.

642
00:32:38,311 --> 00:32:43,311
And you also want to give it a positive 
competitive states states that it wants 

643
00:32:43,311 --> 00:32:44,720
to,
that you want the machine in coach to do

644
00:32:44,930 --> 00:32:47,060
because if they give the machine 
positive feedback.

645
00:32:47,960 --> 00:32:52,280
So you mentioned panpsychism to jump 
back a little bit,

646
00:32:53,260 --> 00:32:58,260
you know,
everything having some kind of mental 

647
00:32:58,260 --> 00:32:58,260
property,
uh,

648
00:32:58,260 --> 00:33:02,120
how,
how do you go from there to something 

649
00:33:02,120 --> 00:33:04,541
like human consciousness?
So everything having some elements of 

650
00:33:04,541 --> 00:33:05,360
consciousness to.
Well,

651
00:33:05,370 --> 00:33:07,700
is there something special about human 
consciousness?

652
00:33:08,100 --> 00:33:11,540
What's so just,
it's not everything like a sport.

653
00:33:11,960 --> 00:33:12,510
There's no.

654
00:33:13,510 --> 00:33:15,390
The of panpsychism I think of,
well,

655
00:33:15,410 --> 00:33:18,310
it doesn't ski consciousness to anything
like this,

656
00:33:18,311 --> 00:33:20,590
the spoon or my liver.
However,

657
00:33:20,920 --> 00:33:21,960
uh,
it is,

658
00:33:22,230 --> 00:33:27,230
uh,
the theory of integrated information 

659
00:33:27,230 --> 00:33:27,230
theory.
It does say that system,

660
00:33:27,230 --> 00:33:28,810
even ones that look from the outside,
the relatively simple,

661
00:33:28,811 --> 00:33:31,060
at least if they have this internal 
calvo power,

662
00:33:31,061 --> 00:33:34,780
they are the.
It does feel like something.

663
00:33:35,260 --> 00:33:40,260
The theory I polio doesn't say anything.
What's special about schumann 

664
00:33:40,260 --> 00:33:43,830
biologically we know what the one thing 
that's special about human is we speak 

665
00:33:43,830 --> 00:33:46,870
and we have an overblown sense of our 
own importance,

666
00:33:47,270 --> 00:33:52,270
right?
Can we believe we are exceptional and 

667
00:33:52,270 --> 00:33:53,500
we're just god's gift to,
to into the universe,

668
00:33:53,710 --> 00:33:56,020
but the but behaviorally the main thing 
that we have,

669
00:33:56,021 --> 00:34:01,021
we can plan,
we can plan or the longterm and we have 

670
00:34:01,021 --> 00:34:01,240
language and that gives us enormous 
amount of power.

671
00:34:01,550 --> 00:34:04,870
That's why we are the dominant species 
on the planet.

672
00:34:05,750 --> 00:34:09,830
So you mentioned god,
you grew up a devout roman catholic,

673
00:34:10,020 --> 00:34:15,020
a roman catholic family.
So you know what consciousness you're 

674
00:34:15,611 --> 00:34:20,611
sort of exploring some really deeply 
fundamental human things that religion 

675
00:34:21,021 --> 00:34:22,610
also touches on.
So where does,

676
00:34:23,210 --> 00:34:25,850
where does religion fit into your 
thinking about consciousness and you've,

677
00:34:26,840 --> 00:34:30,950
you've grown throughout your life and 
changed your views on religion as far as

678
00:34:30,951 --> 00:34:31,430
I understand.

679
00:34:32,190 --> 00:34:33,840
Yeah.
I mean I'm not much closer to.

680
00:34:33,841 --> 00:34:38,841
So I'm not a roman catholic anymore,
I don't believe there's sort of this 

681
00:34:38,841 --> 00:34:39,930
god,
the god I was,

682
00:34:40,110 --> 00:34:42,020
I was educated to believe in,
you know,

683
00:34:42,030 --> 00:34:47,030
sit somewhere in the fullness of time.
I'll be united in some sort of 

684
00:34:47,030 --> 00:34:49,470
everlasting bliss.
I just don't see any evidence for that.

685
00:34:50,100 --> 00:34:52,260
look,
the world the night is large and full of

686
00:34:52,280 --> 00:34:57,280
wonders.
there are many things that I don't 

687
00:34:57,280 --> 00:34:57,750
understand.
I think many things that we as a cult,

688
00:34:57,780 --> 00:35:02,780
he look,
we don't even understand more than four 

689
00:35:02,780 --> 00:35:02,780
percent of all the,
uh,

690
00:35:02,780 --> 00:35:02,780
universe,
dark matter,

691
00:35:02,780 --> 00:35:03,420
dark energy.
We have no idea what it is.

692
00:35:03,421 --> 00:35:05,070
MayBe it's lost socks.
What do I know?

693
00:35:05,610 --> 00:35:10,050
So,
so all I can tell you is sort of my,

694
00:35:10,210 --> 00:35:13,680
my current religious or spiritual 
sentiment is much closer to some form of

695
00:35:13,681 --> 00:35:14,160
buddhism.

696
00:35:16,030 --> 00:35:17,830
Can you just tell debbie income,
asian?

697
00:35:18,340 --> 00:35:20,770
Unfortunately,
there's no evidence for reincarnation.

698
00:35:21,100 --> 00:35:24,940
So can you describe a way buddhism sees 
the world a little bit?

699
00:35:25,440 --> 00:35:26,160
Well,
so the,

700
00:35:26,161 --> 00:35:27,240
you know,
they talk about.

701
00:35:27,241 --> 00:35:32,241
So when I spent several meetings with,
with the dalai lama and what always 

702
00:35:32,281 --> 00:35:33,990
impressed me about him,
he really,

703
00:35:33,991 --> 00:35:34,810
unlike,
for example,

704
00:35:34,811 --> 00:35:36,840
a t there,
the pope or some cottonelle,

705
00:35:36,841 --> 00:35:38,010
he emphasize

706
00:35:38,010 --> 00:35:40,260
minimizing the suffering of all 
creatures.

707
00:35:40,710 --> 00:35:43,170
So they have this from the early 
beginning.

708
00:35:43,171 --> 00:35:46,140
They look at suffering in all creatures,
not just in people,

709
00:35:46,350 --> 00:35:49,350
but in everybody.
This universal and of course by degrees,

710
00:35:49,380 --> 00:35:52,050
right?
An animal child Will have a less,

711
00:35:52,090 --> 00:35:57,090
is less capable of suffering than a,
than a well developed a normally 

712
00:35:57,090 --> 00:36:01,551
developed human and um,
they think consciousness pervades in 

713
00:36:01,551 --> 00:36:04,140
this universe and they have these 
techniques,

714
00:36:04,160 --> 00:36:06,420
you know,
you can think of them like mindfulness,

715
00:36:06,421 --> 00:36:11,421
etc.
in meditation that ties to access sort 

716
00:36:11,421 --> 00:36:13,290
of what they claim of this more 
fundamental aspect of reality.

717
00:36:13,291 --> 00:36:15,720
I'm not sure it's more fundamentalist.
I think about it.

718
00:36:15,721 --> 00:36:18,870
There's a physical and then there's this
insight you consciousness.

719
00:36:18,871 --> 00:36:21,510
and those are the two aspects.
That's the only thing I've,

720
00:36:21,780 --> 00:36:26,780
I've access to in my life.
And you've got to remember my conscious 

721
00:36:26,780 --> 00:36:29,961
expense and you're consciously explains,
comes prior to anything you know about 

722
00:36:29,961 --> 00:36:33,081
physics comes pi to knowledge about the 
universe and atoms and superstrings and 

723
00:36:33,081 --> 00:36:38,061
molecules and all of that.
The only thing you directly acquainted 

724
00:36:38,061 --> 00:36:41,481
with this world that's populated with 
things in images and sounds in your head

725
00:36:41,701 --> 00:36:42,820
and touch us and all of that.

726
00:36:43,170 --> 00:36:48,170
I actually have a question.
So it sounds like you kind of have a 

727
00:36:48,170 --> 00:36:52,351
rich life.
You talk about rock climbing and it 

728
00:36:52,351 --> 00:36:55,591
seems like you really love literature 
and conscious ness is all about 

729
00:36:55,591 --> 00:37:00,120
experiencing things.
So do you think that has helped your 

730
00:37:00,120 --> 00:37:00,290
research on this topic?

731
00:37:00,540 --> 00:37:01,120
Yeah.
Yes.

732
00:37:01,730 --> 00:37:06,730
Particularly if you think about it,
the value of statesville program when 

733
00:37:06,730 --> 00:37:10,151
you do are climbing or now I do.
I'm going in a bike everyday you can get

734
00:37:10,751 --> 00:37:13,620
into this thing called the zone and I've
always wanted.

735
00:37:13,710 --> 00:37:18,710
I wanted above about a particular with 
respect to continence because it's a 

736
00:37:18,710 --> 00:37:18,890
strangely addictive state.
You want to,

737
00:37:19,090 --> 00:37:20,750
you want to appear.
I mean,

738
00:37:20,760 --> 00:37:25,760
once people have had ones who want to 
keep on going back to it and you wonder 

739
00:37:25,760 --> 00:37:25,990
why,
what is it so addicting about it,

740
00:37:25,991 --> 00:37:30,991
and I think it's the experience of,
of almost close to pure experience 

741
00:37:30,991 --> 00:37:32,800
because in this,
in this zone,

742
00:37:32,801 --> 00:37:34,850
you're not conscious of inner voice 
anymore.

743
00:37:34,910 --> 00:37:37,420
There's always the inner voice nagging 
you or do you have to do this?

744
00:37:37,421 --> 00:37:39,130
You have to do that.
You have to pay your taxes.

745
00:37:39,131 --> 00:37:41,820
He had this fight with your ex and all 
of those things are always there,

746
00:37:42,370 --> 00:37:47,370
but when you're in the zone,
all of that is gone and your justice in 

747
00:37:47,370 --> 00:37:47,740
this wonderful state,
while you're fully out in the world,

748
00:37:47,870 --> 00:37:48,660
you're,
you're,

749
00:37:48,740 --> 00:37:51,970
you're climbing or biking or doing 
soccer,

750
00:37:51,971 --> 00:37:54,970
what or whatever you're doing and sort 
of consciousness sort of.

751
00:37:54,970 --> 00:37:58,210
It says you're all action,
or in this case,

752
00:37:58,211 --> 00:38:00,610
a pure experience.
You're not actually at all,

753
00:38:00,880 --> 00:38:04,660
but in both cases you experienced some 
aspect of of con.

754
00:38:04,690 --> 00:38:09,690
You touched some basic part of of,
of conscious existence and it's so basic

755
00:38:10,181 --> 00:38:14,720
and so deeply satisfying you.
I think you tapped the award of being.

756
00:38:14,870 --> 00:38:16,280
That's really what you're touching 
there.

757
00:38:16,281 --> 00:38:21,281
You're getting close to the root of 
being and that's very different from 

758
00:38:21,281 --> 00:38:23,090
intelligence.
So what do you think about

759
00:38:23,210 --> 00:38:25,340
the simulation hypothesis,
simulation theory,

760
00:38:25,341 --> 00:38:27,650
the idea that we all live in a computer 
simulation.

761
00:38:27,950 --> 00:38:28,390
Have you done that?

762
00:38:28,470 --> 00:38:31,300
Just put notes,
laptops for nerds,

763
00:38:31,750 --> 00:38:35,680
for nerds.
I think it's as likely as the hypothesis

764
00:38:35,681 --> 00:38:36,430
that engaged

765
00:38:36,460 --> 00:38:41,460
hundreds of scholars for many centuries.
Are we all just existing in the mind of 

766
00:38:41,460 --> 00:38:42,260
god?
Right?

767
00:38:42,520 --> 00:38:44,310
And this is just a modern version of it.
It's,

768
00:38:44,311 --> 00:38:45,100
it's,
it's,

769
00:38:45,160 --> 00:38:49,060
it's equally plausible.
People love talking about these types of

770
00:38:49,061 --> 00:38:50,470
things.
I know that book written.

771
00:38:50,471 --> 00:38:53,470
So what the simulation hypothesis.
If that's what people want to do,

772
00:38:53,471 --> 00:38:56,080
that's fine.
Seems ratHer esoteric.

773
00:38:56,110 --> 00:38:57,340
It's never testable,

774
00:38:58,170 --> 00:39:00,330
but it's not useful for you to think of 
it in those terms.

775
00:39:00,331 --> 00:39:03,240
So maybe connecting to the questions of 
freewill,

776
00:39:03,270 --> 00:39:04,840
which you've talked about.
Um,

777
00:39:05,010 --> 00:39:07,500
I,
I think vaguely remember you saying that

778
00:39:07,501 --> 00:39:10,150
the idea that there is no freewill,
uh,

779
00:39:10,470 --> 00:39:13,070
it makes you very uncomfortable.
Uh,

780
00:39:13,290 --> 00:39:16,200
so what do you think about freewill in,
from,

781
00:39:16,900 --> 00:39:19,210
from a physics perspective,
from a conscious perspective,

782
00:39:19,270 --> 00:39:20,770
what does it all fit?

783
00:39:20,800 --> 00:39:22,450
Okay.
So from the physics perspective,

784
00:39:22,451 --> 00:39:27,451
leaving aside quantum mechanics,
we believe we live in a fully 

785
00:39:27,451 --> 00:39:27,451
deterministic world,
right?

786
00:39:27,451 --> 00:39:28,720
But then comes up course quantum 
mechanics.

787
00:39:28,721 --> 00:39:30,930
So now we know that certain things on 
principle,

788
00:39:30,940 --> 00:39:33,370
not predictable,
which I put as you said,

789
00:39:33,371 --> 00:39:38,371
I prefer because the idea that at the 
initial condition of the universe and 

790
00:39:38,371 --> 00:39:43,051
then everything else would just acting 
out the initial condition of the 

791
00:39:43,051 --> 00:39:43,051
universe.
That doesn't.

792
00:39:43,051 --> 00:39:45,160
That doesn't mean it's not a romantic 
notion.

793
00:39:45,560 --> 00:39:48,430
Suddenly not right now when it comes to 
consciousness,

794
00:39:48,431 --> 00:39:53,431
I think we do have certain freedom.
We are much more constrained by physics 

795
00:39:53,431 --> 00:39:57,901
of course,
and by our paths and by our own 

796
00:39:57,901 --> 00:39:59,791
conscious desires and what our pounds 
told us and what our environment tells 

797
00:39:59,791 --> 00:39:59,791
us.
We,

798
00:39:59,791 --> 00:40:04,100
we all know that there's hundreds of 
experiments that show how we can be 

799
00:40:04,100 --> 00:40:05,860
influenced.
But finally in the final analysis,

800
00:40:05,861 --> 00:40:10,861
When you make a life that I'm talking 
about really about critical decision 

801
00:40:10,861 --> 00:40:10,861
where you really think,
should I marry?

802
00:40:10,861 --> 00:40:12,130
Should I go to this school,
have that,

803
00:40:12,150 --> 00:40:14,710
could take this job,
that job.

804
00:40:14,860 --> 00:40:18,550
Should I cheat on my taxes are not the 
sort of,

805
00:40:18,551 --> 00:40:23,551
these are things where you really 
deliberate and I think on those 

806
00:40:23,551 --> 00:40:24,580
condition you are as free as you can be 
when you,

807
00:40:24,581 --> 00:40:29,581
when you bring your entire being and 
time conscious being to that question 

808
00:40:31,001 --> 00:40:33,800
and title analysts analyze it on all the
the values,

809
00:40:33,801 --> 00:40:34,840
condition.
Then you take,

810
00:40:35,260 --> 00:40:38,170
you make a decision.
You are as free as you can ever be.

811
00:40:38,650 --> 00:40:40,540
That is,
I think what free will is.

812
00:40:40,541 --> 00:40:45,541
It's not a will.
That's totally free to do anything it 

813
00:40:45,541 --> 00:40:45,541
wants.
That's not possible.

814
00:40:45,690 --> 00:40:48,330
Right?
So as jack mentioned,

815
00:40:48,790 --> 00:40:53,670
you actually write a blog about books 
you've read amazing books from.

816
00:40:53,730 --> 00:40:56,860
I'm rushing from my son.
Might have been tough.

817
00:40:57,110 --> 00:40:59,040
Yeah.
Neil gaiman,

818
00:40:59,070 --> 00:41:04,070
carl sagan murakami.
So what is a book that early in your 

819
00:41:04,070 --> 00:41:06,420
life transform the way you saw the 
world?

820
00:41:06,480 --> 00:41:07,650
Something that changed your life,

821
00:41:09,940 --> 00:41:14,940
I guess did the spokes are twisted 
because he talks about some of these 

822
00:41:14,940 --> 00:41:14,940
problems,
you know,

823
00:41:14,940 --> 00:41:17,980
he was one of the first discovery of the
unconscious because,

824
00:41:18,080 --> 00:41:21,180
you know,
a little bit before freud when it wasn't

825
00:41:21,181 --> 00:41:26,181
in the air and you know,
he makes all these claims that people 

826
00:41:26,181 --> 00:41:30,971
sort of,
I know the guys on the mass of charity 

827
00:41:30,971 --> 00:41:34,090
actually are very non charitable.
So he of really the first discovery of a

828
00:41:36,470 --> 00:41:40,010
great line of the,
of the unconscious and that,

829
00:41:40,011 --> 00:41:41,180
uh,
that really taught me.

830
00:41:41,380 --> 00:41:46,380
And what do you think,
what do you think about the unconscious 

831
00:41:46,380 --> 00:41:46,380
w?
What do you think about freud with think

832
00:41:46,380 --> 00:41:47,490
about these ideas?
What's,

833
00:41:47,640 --> 00:41:49,630
what's just like dark matter in the 
universe?

834
00:41:49,710 --> 00:41:51,700
What's over there in that unconscious

835
00:41:51,950 --> 00:41:53,750
a lot.
I mean much more than we think,

836
00:41:53,760 --> 00:41:56,090
right?
This is what a lot of last hundred years

837
00:41:56,091 --> 00:41:58,820
of research has shown.
So I think he was a genius,

838
00:41:59,260 --> 00:42:01,040
misguided towards the end,
but he was all.

839
00:42:01,041 --> 00:42:03,650
He started out as a neuroscientist.
He contributed,

840
00:42:03,651 --> 00:42:05,430
he did studies on the,
um,

841
00:42:06,140 --> 00:42:11,140
on the lamprey,
contributed himself to the neuron 

842
00:42:11,140 --> 00:42:14,591
hypothesis,
the idea that they're discrete units 

843
00:42:14,591 --> 00:42:14,591
that we call ourselves now.
And then he started,

844
00:42:14,591 --> 00:42:15,800
then he,
he,

845
00:42:15,801 --> 00:42:16,910
um,
bought,

846
00:42:16,911 --> 00:42:21,911
you know,
about the unconscious and I think it's 

847
00:42:21,911 --> 00:42:21,911
too,
there's lots of stuff happening.

848
00:42:21,911 --> 00:42:22,420
You feel this particular,
um,

849
00:42:22,520 --> 00:42:24,920
when you're in a relationship and it 
breaks our son now,

850
00:42:24,921 --> 00:42:26,660
right?
And then you have this terrible.

851
00:42:26,661 --> 00:42:29,880
You can have love and hate and lust and 
anger and all.

852
00:42:29,900 --> 00:42:33,290
It's mixed in.
And when you title analyzed yourself,

853
00:42:33,291 --> 00:42:35,720
why am I so upset?
it's very,

854
00:42:35,721 --> 00:42:38,800
very difficult to penetrate to those 
basements,

855
00:42:38,810 --> 00:42:43,810
those cabins in your mind because the 
subconscious doesn't have access to 

856
00:42:44,451 --> 00:42:49,451
those,
but there they are made in the amygdala 

857
00:42:49,451 --> 00:42:51,540
or lots of other places.
They make you upset or angry or sad or 

858
00:42:51,540 --> 00:42:55,331
depressed.
And it's very difficult to try to 

859
00:42:55,331 --> 00:42:55,490
actually uncover the reason you can go 
to a shrink.

860
00:42:55,491 --> 00:43:00,491
You can talk wIth your friend endlessly.
You couldn't start finally a story why 

861
00:43:00,491 --> 00:43:04,361
this happened,
why you love or don't love her or 

862
00:43:04,361 --> 00:43:04,361
whatever,
but you don't really know whether that's

863
00:43:04,361 --> 00:43:08,471
actually the way that that actually 
happened because you simply don't have 

864
00:43:08,471 --> 00:43:09,410
access to those parts of the brain and 
they're very powerful.

865
00:43:09,640 --> 00:43:12,150
You think that's a feature or a bug of 
our brain?

866
00:43:12,510 --> 00:43:16,590
The fact that we have this deep 
difficult to dive into subconscious.

867
00:43:16,860 --> 00:43:19,050
I think it's a feature because 
otherwise,

868
00:43:19,230 --> 00:43:24,230
look,
we are like any other brain or nervous 

869
00:43:24,381 --> 00:43:28,130
system or computer.
We are severely band limited.

870
00:43:28,520 --> 00:43:31,310
If we,
if everything I do,

871
00:43:31,311 --> 00:43:33,980
every emotion I feel every eye movements
I make,

872
00:43:33,981 --> 00:43:36,890
if all of that had to be under the 
control of consciousness,

873
00:43:36,891 --> 00:43:39,560
I couldn't.
I couldn't.

874
00:43:39,860 --> 00:43:41,570
I wouldn't be here.
Right?

875
00:43:41,571 --> 00:43:44,510
So,
so what you do early on your brain,

876
00:43:44,511 --> 00:43:49,511
you have to be conscious when you learn 
things like typing or like riding on a 

877
00:43:49,511 --> 00:43:49,670
bike,
but then what you do,

878
00:43:49,671 --> 00:43:54,240
you attain up our basal ganglia and 
stratum you.

879
00:43:54,340 --> 00:43:59,340
You train up different parts of your 
brain and then once you do it 

880
00:43:59,340 --> 00:44:02,831
automatically like typing,
you can show you do it much faster 

881
00:44:02,831 --> 00:44:03,430
without even thinking about it because 
you've got these highly specialized what

882
00:44:03,550 --> 00:44:05,450
francis crick and I called zombie agents

883
00:44:06,310 --> 00:44:11,310
that I can sort of taken care of that 
while your consciousness can sort of 

884
00:44:11,310 --> 00:44:14,521
worry about the abstract sense of the 
text to one of wide and I think that's 

885
00:44:14,521 --> 00:44:14,521
true for many,
many things,

886
00:44:14,740 --> 00:44:19,740
but for the things like uh,
all the fights you had with the ex 

887
00:44:19,740 --> 00:44:24,091
girlfriend,
things that you would think are not 

888
00:44:24,091 --> 00:44:24,850
useful to still linger somewhere in the 
subconscious.

889
00:44:25,180 --> 00:44:28,000
So that seems like a bug that it would 
staY there.

890
00:44:28,320 --> 00:44:32,190
You think it would be better if you can 
analyze and then get it out the system

891
00:44:32,190 --> 00:44:34,380
or just forget it ever happened?
You know,

892
00:44:34,381 --> 00:44:36,960
that that seems a very buggy kind of.

893
00:44:37,520 --> 00:44:39,320
Yeah.
In general we don't have.

894
00:44:39,321 --> 00:44:44,321
And that's probably functional.
We don't have an ability unless it's 

895
00:44:44,321 --> 00:44:47,351
extremely off cases,
clinical dissociation side when people 

896
00:44:47,351 --> 00:44:51,140
are heavily abused,
when they completely repressed the 

897
00:44:51,140 --> 00:44:51,140
memory.
But that doeSn't happen in,

898
00:44:51,140 --> 00:44:51,800
in,
in,

899
00:44:51,830 --> 00:44:56,830
you know,
in normal people we don't have an 

900
00:44:56,830 --> 00:44:58,400
ability to move traumatic memories and 
of course we suffer from that.

901
00:44:58,940 --> 00:45:03,940
On the other hand,
probably if you had the ability to 

902
00:45:03,940 --> 00:45:07,031
constantly wipe your memory,
you'll probably do it to an extent that 

903
00:45:07,031 --> 00:45:07,490
isn't useful to you.
So

904
00:45:08,510 --> 00:45:10,280
yeah,
it's a good question.

905
00:45:10,281 --> 00:45:12,590
it's a balance.
So I'm on the books,

906
00:45:12,591 --> 00:45:15,650
as jack mentioned,
correct me if I'm wrong,

907
00:45:15,651 --> 00:45:20,360
but a broadly speaking in academia and 
the different scientific disciplines,

908
00:45:20,361 --> 00:45:25,361
certainly in engineering,
reading literature seems to be a rare 

909
00:45:25,361 --> 00:45:27,260
pursuit.
Perhaps I'm wrong in this,

910
00:45:27,261 --> 00:45:32,261
but that's in my experience,
most people are much more technical 

911
00:45:32,261 --> 00:45:35,411
texts and do not sort of escape or seek 
truth in literature.

912
00:45:35,960 --> 00:45:38,330
Um,
it seems like you do a.

913
00:45:38,331 --> 00:45:43,331
So what do you think is the value?
What do you think literature as the 

914
00:45:43,331 --> 00:45:45,260
pursuit of scientific truth,
do you think it's good?

915
00:45:45,320 --> 00:45:46,990
It's useful for a

916
00:45:47,270 --> 00:45:49,260
government access too much wide,
uh,

917
00:45:49,261 --> 00:45:50,320
of a,
of a,

918
00:45:50,321 --> 00:45:51,770
of human experiences.

919
00:45:52,470 --> 00:45:53,910
How valuable do you think it is?

920
00:45:54,150 --> 00:45:59,150
Well,
if you want to understand human nature 

921
00:45:59,150 --> 00:46:01,881
and nature in general,
then I think you'll have to better 

922
00:46:01,881 --> 00:46:04,131
understand wide variety of experiences,
not just sitting in a lab staring at a 

923
00:46:04,351 --> 00:46:06,720
screen and having a piece flashed onto 
your planner,

924
00:46:06,780 --> 00:46:08,280
melissa pushing a button.
That's what.

925
00:46:08,670 --> 00:46:10,560
That's what I usually do that for most 
psychologists do.

926
00:46:10,561 --> 00:46:15,561
there's nothing wrong with that,
but you need to consider lots of other 

927
00:46:15,561 --> 00:46:18,990
strange states and literature is a 
shortcut for this as well.

928
00:46:19,021 --> 00:46:19,890
Yeah,
because literature,

929
00:46:19,910 --> 00:46:24,910
that's what literature is all about.
All sorts of interesting experiences 

930
00:46:24,910 --> 00:46:26,820
that people have know the contingency of
it,

931
00:46:26,821 --> 00:46:29,100
the fact that you know,
women experience a world different.

932
00:46:29,101 --> 00:46:34,101
Black people experience the world 
different and the one way to expense 

933
00:46:34,101 --> 00:46:35,640
that is reading all these different 
literature and title.

934
00:46:35,910 --> 00:46:40,910
Find out you,
you see everything so relative and you 

935
00:46:40,910 --> 00:46:40,920
read the book years ago they thought 
about certain problems very,

936
00:46:40,921 --> 00:46:42,930
very differently than the.
Then as today,

937
00:46:43,170 --> 00:46:44,560
we today,
like any culture,

938
00:46:44,561 --> 00:46:47,250
I think we know it all.
That's common to every culture.

939
00:46:47,251 --> 00:46:50,640
Every culture believes that at a td.
They know it all and then you realize,

940
00:46:50,641 --> 00:46:55,641
well,
there's other ways of viewing the 

941
00:46:55,641 --> 00:46:55,641
universe and some of them may have lots 
of things in their favor.

942
00:46:56,620 --> 00:47:01,390
So this is a question I wanted to ask 
about timescale or scale in general,

943
00:47:02,530 --> 00:47:06,220
when you with it or in general tried to 
think about consciousness.

944
00:47:06,310 --> 00:47:11,310
Trying to think about these ideas were 
kind of naturally thinking human 

945
00:47:11,310 --> 00:47:13,480
timescales.
Do you um,

946
00:47:13,540 --> 00:47:14,290
or,
and also,

947
00:47:15,150 --> 00:47:18,580
uh,
entities that are sized close to humans,

948
00:47:19,000 --> 00:47:20,550
do you think of things that are much 
larger,

949
00:47:20,570 --> 00:47:24,460
much smaller as containing consciousness
and do you think are things that take,

950
00:47:25,240 --> 00:47:27,580
you know,
you know,

951
00:47:27,610 --> 00:47:28,840
the ages?
Yeah,

952
00:47:29,530 --> 00:47:30,230
to,
uh,

953
00:47:30,430 --> 00:47:34,450
to operate in their conscious cause.
Effect cause effect.

954
00:47:34,660 --> 00:47:35,740
It's a reallY good question.
So yeah,

955
00:47:35,741 --> 00:47:38,230
I think a lot about small creatures 
because experimentally,

956
00:47:38,231 --> 00:47:40,720
you know,
a lot of people work on flies and bees.

957
00:47:41,110 --> 00:47:46,110
I,
so most people just think they are 

958
00:47:46,110 --> 00:47:46,110
tolmatter.
They're just bags for heaven sake.

959
00:47:46,110 --> 00:47:46,480
Right?
But if you look at their behavior,

960
00:47:46,481 --> 00:47:48,790
like being,
he can recognize individual humans,

961
00:47:48,791 --> 00:47:52,210
they have this very complicated way to 
communicate.

962
00:47:52,390 --> 00:47:53,920
If you've ever been involved with,
you know,

963
00:47:53,921 --> 00:47:57,400
your pounds when they bought a house,
what sort of agonizing decision that is,

964
00:47:57,700 --> 00:48:02,700
and bees have to do that once a year.
I'd when they swarm in the spring and 

965
00:48:02,700 --> 00:48:04,320
then they have this very elaborate way.
They have free not scouted the.

966
00:48:04,340 --> 00:48:06,130
They go to the individual sites,
they come back,

967
00:48:06,131 --> 00:48:07,510
they have this power,
this dance.

968
00:48:07,511 --> 00:48:09,130
Literally where the dance was several 
days.

969
00:48:09,340 --> 00:48:10,830
They try to recruit other leaders.

970
00:48:10,870 --> 00:48:12,340
Very complicated decision.
Wait,

971
00:48:12,580 --> 00:48:14,320
when they finally wanting to make a 
decision,

972
00:48:14,321 --> 00:48:17,430
the entire swarm,
their scouts warm up the entire swim and

973
00:48:17,431 --> 00:48:19,450
then go to one occasion.
They don't go to christian.

974
00:48:19,510 --> 00:48:22,570
They go to one location that they scout 
type agreed upon by themselves.

975
00:48:22,580 --> 00:48:24,940
That's awesome.
But look at the circuit complexity.

976
00:48:24,941 --> 00:48:28,270
It's 10 times more dense than anything 
we have in our brain or they only have a

977
00:48:28,271 --> 00:48:30,460
million neurons,
but then you amazingly complex,

978
00:48:30,730 --> 00:48:32,720
complex behavior,
very complicated circuitry.

979
00:48:32,730 --> 00:48:34,240
So there's no question that they 
experienced.

980
00:48:34,241 --> 00:48:37,030
Something they alive is very different.
They're tiny.

981
00:48:37,270 --> 00:48:42,270
The only live you know for,
for workers live from maybe for two 

982
00:48:42,270 --> 00:48:44,290
months.
So I think it tells you this,

983
00:48:44,291 --> 00:48:49,291
in principle,
the substrate of consciousness is the 

984
00:48:49,291 --> 00:48:52,531
substrate that maximizes the cause 
effect power over all possible spatial 

985
00:48:52,531 --> 00:48:53,920
temporal grains.
So when I think about,

986
00:48:53,921 --> 00:48:55,690
for example,
do you know the science fiction story,

987
00:48:55,700 --> 00:48:58,400
the black cloud,
it's a classic,

988
00:48:58,440 --> 00:48:59,650
I forgot holiday astronomer.

989
00:49:00,040 --> 00:49:05,040
He has this cloud intervening between 
the earth and the sun and I'm leading to

990
00:49:05,891 --> 00:49:08,710
some sort of to global cooling.
This is written in the fifties.

991
00:49:08,980 --> 00:49:11,680
It turns out you can using the,
the um,

992
00:49:11,730 --> 00:49:16,730
the radio dish they communicate was 
actually an entity to actually 

993
00:49:16,730 --> 00:49:17,140
intelligent entity and they,
they,

994
00:49:17,170 --> 00:49:19,570
they sort of,
they convinced her to move away.

995
00:49:20,140 --> 00:49:22,300
But here you have a radical different 
entity.

996
00:49:22,301 --> 00:49:24,640
And in pencil it says,
well,

997
00:49:24,641 --> 00:49:29,641
you can measure the,
the integrated information in principle 

998
00:49:29,641 --> 00:49:29,641
at least.
And yes,

999
00:49:29,641 --> 00:49:33,721
if that,
if the maximum of that occurs at a 

1000
00:49:33,721 --> 00:49:35,440
timescale of month rather than an asset 
for the fraction of a second.

1001
00:49:35,590 --> 00:49:40,590
Yes.
And they would experience life where 

1002
00:49:40,590 --> 00:49:40,590
each moment is a month rather than,
um,

1003
00:49:40,690 --> 00:49:41,850
or microseconds,
right?

1004
00:49:41,860 --> 00:49:45,880
Rather than a fraction of a second in 
the human case.

1005
00:49:46,690 --> 00:49:51,690
And so there may be forms of conscience 
that we simply don't recognize for what 

1006
00:49:51,690 --> 00:49:55,501
they are because they are so radical,
different from anything you and I are 

1007
00:49:55,501 --> 00:49:55,501
used to.

1008
00:49:55,780 --> 00:49:57,100
Again,
that's why it's good to read.

1009
00:49:58,000 --> 00:50:01,970
Or to what science fiction where we want
to think about this like this.

1010
00:50:02,290 --> 00:50:06,240
Do you know stanislaw lem,
this polished and sectional he bought it

1011
00:50:06,280 --> 00:50:08,960
was turned into a hollywood movie.
His best novel.

1012
00:50:08,961 --> 00:50:10,550
So it was in the sixties,
very,

1013
00:50:10,720 --> 00:50:15,720
very engineered,
engineered back on his most interesting 

1014
00:50:15,720 --> 00:50:16,750
novel is called the victoria's where I'm
human,

1015
00:50:16,751 --> 00:50:18,190
civilization they,
they,

1016
00:50:18,250 --> 00:50:18,850
they,
they,

1017
00:50:18,851 --> 00:50:23,851
they have this mission to this planet 
and everything is just tired and they 

1018
00:50:23,851 --> 00:50:27,571
discover machines.
Schumann's got killed and then these 

1019
00:50:27,571 --> 00:50:30,601
machines took over.
There was a machine evolution at 

1020
00:50:30,601 --> 00:50:34,180
dominion evolution.
He talks about this very vividly and 

1021
00:50:34,180 --> 00:50:37,241
finally the dominant.
They're the dominant machine 

1022
00:50:37,241 --> 00:50:40,601
intelligence organisms that survive are 
gigantic clouds of little hexagonal 

1023
00:50:40,821 --> 00:50:43,570
universal cell automata.
This was in the sixties,

1024
00:50:44,140 --> 00:50:47,270
but typically they're all lying on the 
ground individual by themselves.

1025
00:50:47,271 --> 00:50:52,271
But in times of kaiser's econ,
communicate the assembling to gigantic 

1026
00:50:52,271 --> 00:50:55,961
nets into clouds.
Billions of these particles and then 

1027
00:50:55,961 --> 00:50:59,471
theY become hyper intelligent and they 
can beat anything that humans can of 

1028
00:50:59,471 --> 00:50:59,530
control it.
It,

1029
00:50:59,900 --> 00:51:04,900
it's a very beautiful and compelling 
where you have an intelligence where 

1030
00:51:04,900 --> 00:51:09,101
finally the schumann's leave the planet.
TheY simply unable to understand and 

1031
00:51:09,101 --> 00:51:09,740
comprehend this creature and they can 
say,

1032
00:51:09,741 --> 00:51:11,530
well,
either we can nuke the entire planet and

1033
00:51:11,540 --> 00:51:15,050
just tired or we just have to leave 
because fundamentally it's an,

1034
00:51:15,070 --> 00:51:20,070
it's an alien.
It's so alien from us in our ideas that 

1035
00:51:20,070 --> 00:51:20,070
we cannot communicate with them.

1036
00:51:21,130 --> 00:51:22,840
Yeah.
Actually in conversation.

1037
00:51:22,841 --> 00:51:27,841
So your talent to us steel steel from 
brought up is that there could be to his

1038
00:51:27,921 --> 00:51:29,320
ideas that,
you know,

1039
00:51:29,370 --> 00:51:33,580
you already have these artificial 
general intelligence like super smart or

1040
00:51:33,581 --> 00:51:38,581
maybe conscious beings in these sally or
tom and we just don't know how to talk 

1041
00:51:38,581 --> 00:51:41,731
to them.
So that's the language of communication 

1042
00:51:41,731 --> 00:51:41,731
because you don't know what to do with 
it.

1043
00:51:41,731 --> 00:51:46,290
So that's one sort of view is a 
consciousness is only something you can 

1044
00:51:46,290 --> 00:51:51,210
measure.
So it's not conscious if you can't 

1045
00:51:51,210 --> 00:51:51,210
measure it.

1046
00:51:51,210 --> 00:51:53,000
So you're making an ontological and an 
epistemic statement.

1047
00:51:53,001 --> 00:51:54,530
One is they are,
they are.

1048
00:51:54,930 --> 00:51:58,150
it's just like seeing their multiverses.
That might be cool,

1049
00:51:58,220 --> 00:52:00,150
but I can't communicate with them.
I don't have.

1050
00:52:00,190 --> 00:52:03,140
I can't have any noncitizen.
That's an epistemic argument to.

1051
00:52:03,440 --> 00:52:05,570
Those are two different things,
so it may well be possible.

1052
00:52:05,780 --> 00:52:07,610
Look at another case that's happening 
right now.

1053
00:52:07,611 --> 00:52:09,470
People are building these mini 
organoids.

1054
00:52:09,640 --> 00:52:12,920
Do you know what is so you know you can 
take stem cells from under your arm,

1055
00:52:12,921 --> 00:52:15,260
put it in a dish ad for transcription 
factors,

1056
00:52:15,261 --> 00:52:18,980
and then you can induce him to to go 
into large with large.

1057
00:52:18,981 --> 00:52:23,981
They have few millimeter.
They are like a half a million neurons 

1058
00:52:23,981 --> 00:52:26,470
that looked like nerve cells in a dish 
called mini organoids at harvard and 

1059
00:52:26,470 --> 00:52:26,930
stanford.
EverYwhere they're building them.

1060
00:52:27,230 --> 00:52:30,320
It may be well be possible that they're 
beginning to feel like something,

1061
00:52:30,660 --> 00:52:33,290
but we can't really communicate with 
them right now.

1062
00:52:33,500 --> 00:52:35,690
So people are beginning to think about 
the ethics of this,

1063
00:52:35,720 --> 00:52:36,770
right?
So yes,

1064
00:52:36,771 --> 00:52:39,230
he may be perfectly high,
but they made.

1065
00:52:39,650 --> 00:52:41,780
It's one question.
Are they conscious or not?

1066
00:52:41,790 --> 00:52:43,850
As totally separate question,
how would I know?

1067
00:52:43,910 --> 00:52:44,960
Those are two different things,

1068
00:52:45,070 --> 00:52:50,070
right?
If you could give advice to a young 

1069
00:52:50,070 --> 00:52:53,671
researcher sort of dreaming of 
understanding or creating human level 

1070
00:52:53,681 --> 00:52:58,681
intelligence or consciousness,
what would you say follow your dreams?

1071
00:53:01,200 --> 00:53:04,410
Read quite widely.
Know I mean I,

1072
00:53:04,411 --> 00:53:05,820
I suppose,
what discipline,

1073
00:53:05,840 --> 00:53:10,840
what,
what is the pursuit that they should 

1074
00:53:10,840 --> 00:53:10,840
take on?
Is it neuroscience?

1075
00:53:10,840 --> 00:53:12,750
Is a competition of cognitive science?
Is it philosophy?

1076
00:53:13,020 --> 00:53:16,610
Is it computer science or politics?
I

1077
00:53:16,670 --> 00:53:21,670
know in a sense that okay,
so the only known system that have high 

1078
00:53:21,891 --> 00:53:25,650
level of intelligence is homo sapiens,
so if you wanted to build it,

1079
00:53:25,651 --> 00:53:28,760
it's probably good to continue to study 
closely what humans do.

1080
00:53:28,770 --> 00:53:30,480
So cognitive neuroscience,
you know,

1081
00:53:30,481 --> 00:53:35,481
somewhere between cognitive neuroscience
on the one hand than some philosophy of 

1082
00:53:35,481 --> 00:53:36,180
mind and then ai,
ai,

1083
00:53:36,480 --> 00:53:39,750
computer science.
You can look at all the original ideas,

1084
00:53:39,751 --> 00:53:41,600
new network.
They all came from neon signs,

1085
00:53:41,610 --> 00:53:43,820
right?
Or reinforcement,

1086
00:53:43,830 --> 00:53:48,830
whether it's snarky,
minsky billing is snarky or whether 

1087
00:53:48,830 --> 00:53:48,830
it's,
you know,

1088
00:53:48,830 --> 00:53:49,170
the early in visal experiments that.
How about that?

1089
00:53:49,171 --> 00:53:51,870
Then gave rise to networks and then 
multilayer networks,

1090
00:53:52,710 --> 00:53:55,020
so it may well be possible.
In fact,

1091
00:53:55,021 --> 00:53:57,990
some people are you there to make the 
next big step in ai.

1092
00:53:57,991 --> 00:54:01,020
Once we realize the limits of deep 
convolutional networks,

1093
00:54:01,470 --> 00:54:03,930
I didn't do certain things,
but they can't really understand.

1094
00:54:04,380 --> 00:54:05,200
I did,
don't they?

1095
00:54:05,240 --> 00:54:06,570
They don't really.
They can't really.

1096
00:54:06,571 --> 00:54:11,571
I can't really show in one image,
I can show you a single image of 

1097
00:54:11,571 --> 00:54:14,780
somebody pick pocket who steals a wallet
from a purse.

1098
00:54:14,820 --> 00:54:16,390
You immediately know that's a 
pickpocket.

1099
00:54:16,410 --> 00:54:18,240
right now.
Computer system will just say,

1100
00:54:18,241 --> 00:54:19,110
well,
it's a man.

1101
00:54:19,111 --> 00:54:20,290
It's a woman.
It's a purse.

1102
00:54:20,880 --> 00:54:23,640
Unless you turn this machine on,
showing it 100,000

1103
00:54:23,641 --> 00:54:25,320
pickpockets.
I taught it doesn't.

1104
00:54:25,321 --> 00:54:27,840
It doesn't have this easy understanding 
that you have.

1105
00:54:28,260 --> 00:54:33,260
All right,
so so some people make the ironman in 

1106
00:54:33,260 --> 00:54:36,231
order to go to the next step or you 
really want to build machines that 

1107
00:54:36,231 --> 00:54:36,231
understand in a way,
you and I,

1108
00:54:36,231 --> 00:54:40,221
we have to go to psychology.
We need to understand how we do it in 

1109
00:54:40,221 --> 00:54:40,290
our brains,
enable us to do it,

1110
00:54:40,320 --> 00:54:45,320
and so therefore being on the cast,
it's also so exciting to try to 

1111
00:54:45,320 --> 00:54:49,131
understand better our nature and then to
build to take some of those insight and 

1112
00:54:49,131 --> 00:54:53,301
build them.
So I think the most exciting thing is 

1113
00:54:53,301 --> 00:54:53,301
somewhere in the interface between 
cognitive science,

1114
00:54:53,301 --> 00:54:53,790
neuroscience,
ai,

1115
00:54:53,791 --> 00:54:55,590
computer science and philosophy of mind.

1116
00:54:56,620 --> 00:54:57,200
beautiful.
yeah.

1117
00:54:57,201 --> 00:55:00,250
I'd say if there is from the machine 
learning for from the computer science,

1118
00:55:00,251 --> 00:55:05,251
computer vision perspective may have the
research is kind of ignore the way the 

1119
00:55:05,251 --> 00:55:08,080
human brain works.
You can or even psychology or literature

1120
00:55:08,081 --> 00:55:12,610
or studying the brain.
I would hope josh tannenbaum talks about

1121
00:55:12,670 --> 00:55:16,070
bringing that in more and more and 
that's a.

1122
00:55:17,240 --> 00:55:19,600
So you've worked on some amazing stuff 
throughout your life.

1123
00:55:19,870 --> 00:55:24,280
What's the thing that you're really 
excited about?

1124
00:55:24,340 --> 00:55:29,340
What's the mystery that you would love 
to uncover in the near term beyond 

1125
00:55:29,950 --> 00:55:32,290
beyond all the mr dharia already 
surrounded by.

1126
00:55:32,840 --> 00:55:37,840
Well,
so that's this tuck shop called the 

1127
00:55:37,840 --> 00:55:39,410
cloth [inaudible].
Underneath our cortex is a big.

1128
00:55:39,780 --> 00:55:42,230
You have one on the left,
right underneath this,

1129
00:55:42,500 --> 00:55:44,120
underneath the insula.
It's very thin,

1130
00:55:44,121 --> 00:55:45,980
it's like one millimeter,
it's embedded in,

1131
00:55:45,981 --> 00:55:50,720
in wiring in white matter is,
it's very difficult to image and um,

1132
00:55:50,900 --> 00:55:51,950
it has,
uh,

1133
00:55:51,951 --> 00:55:56,330
it has connection to every cortical 
region and francis kicked the last paper

1134
00:55:56,331 --> 00:56:01,331
you have,
have he dictated corrections the day he 

1135
00:56:01,331 --> 00:56:01,331
died in hospital on this paper.
He and we,

1136
00:56:01,420 --> 00:56:05,120
it hypothesized,
well because it has this unique anatomy,

1137
00:56:05,121 --> 00:56:10,121
it gets input from every cortical area 
and projects back to every area that the

1138
00:56:11,001 --> 00:56:16,001
function of this structure is similar.
That it's just a metaphor to the role of

1139
00:56:16,320 --> 00:56:21,320
conducting a sYmphony orchestra.
You have all the different cortical 

1140
00:56:21,320 --> 00:56:21,810
players,
you have some that do motion,

1141
00:56:21,811 --> 00:56:23,650
some they do with theory of mind that 
in,

1142
00:56:23,651 --> 00:56:28,651
for social interaction and calais and 
hearing and all the different modules 

1143
00:56:28,651 --> 00:56:29,500
and cortex,
but of course what consciousness is.

1144
00:56:29,500 --> 00:56:31,860
Consciousness puts it all together into 
one package,

1145
00:56:31,870 --> 00:56:32,750
right?
The binding problem,

1146
00:56:32,770 --> 00:56:37,770
all of that.
And this is really the function because 

1147
00:56:37,770 --> 00:56:38,140
it has relatively few nuanced compared 
to cop cappex,

1148
00:56:38,141 --> 00:56:38,720
but it,
it,

1149
00:56:38,800 --> 00:56:41,990
it talks it a,
it seeks input from all of them and they

1150
00:56:42,010 --> 00:56:45,010
project back to all of them.
And so we're testing that right now,

1151
00:56:45,011 --> 00:56:48,450
we've got this beautiful new owner 
reconstruction in the mouse called count

1152
00:56:48,451 --> 00:56:53,451
of thought and kind of found new onset 
or in the classroom that have the most 

1153
00:56:53,451 --> 00:56:56,320
widespread connection of any nerve new 
on I've ever seen.

1154
00:56:56,321 --> 00:56:57,040
They're very,
they,

1155
00:56:57,320 --> 00:56:59,890
you have individually onto sit in the 
clouds from tiny.

1156
00:56:59,891 --> 00:57:04,891
But then they had this single neurons 
have this huge external tree that cover 

1157
00:57:04,891 --> 00:57:08,490
both ipsy and contract of apple cortex 
and kind of using,

1158
00:57:08,491 --> 00:57:10,290
you know,
fancy tools like optogenetics,

1159
00:57:10,330 --> 00:57:15,330
titled term.
Those nuanced on honor often studied 

1160
00:57:15,330 --> 00:57:15,330
what happens in the,
in the malls.

1161
00:57:15,350 --> 00:57:20,310
So this thing is perhaps where the parts
become the whole interface.

1162
00:57:20,550 --> 00:57:24,530
It's one of this conscious,
it's a verY good way of putting it where

1163
00:57:24,531 --> 00:57:28,130
the individual parts turned into the 
whole of the whole,

1164
00:57:28,131 --> 00:57:31,400
of the conscious experience.
Well,

1165
00:57:31,401 --> 00:57:36,401
with that,
thank you very much for being here 

1166
00:57:36,401 --> 00:57:36,401
today.
Thank you so much.

1167
00:57:37,420 --> 00:57:38,300
Thank you so much.
