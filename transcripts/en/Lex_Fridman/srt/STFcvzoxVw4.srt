00:00:00,100 --> 00:00:02,530
The following is a conversation with 
Vladimir of apnic.

2
00:00:03,100 --> 00:00:05,230
He's the inventor of the support vector 
machines,

3
00:00:05,290 --> 00:00:10,290
support vector clustering,
vc theory and many foundational ideas 

4
00:00:10,290 --> 00:00:14,341
and statistical learning is born in the 
Soviet Union and worked at the Institute

5
00:00:15,280 --> 00:00:17,920
of Control Sciences and Moscow.
Then in the United States.

6
00:00:18,070 --> 00:00:23,070
He worked at a and t and e Silabs 
facebook research and now as a professor

7
00:00:23,831 --> 00:00:28,831
at Columbia University.
His work has been cited over 170,000

8
00:00:28,991 --> 00:00:32,140
times.
He has some very interesting ideas about

9
00:00:32,141 --> 00:00:34,600
artificial intelligence and the nature 
of learning,

10
00:00:34,810 --> 00:00:39,810
especially on limits of our current 
approaches and the open problems in the 

11
00:00:39,810 --> 00:00:43,801
field.
This conversation is part of mit course 

12
00:00:43,801 --> 00:00:46,420
on artificial general intelligence and 
artificial intelligence podcasts.

13

16
00:00:57,160 --> 00:00:58,570
Friedman,
spelled F,

17
00:00:58,571 --> 00:00:59,590
R I,
D,

18
00:01:00,210 --> 00:01:03,360
and now.
Here's my conversation with Latimer vap.

19
00:01:03,380 --> 00:01:08,380
Nick Einstein famously said that God 
doesn't play dice.

20
00:01:08,810 --> 00:01:13,810
You're.
You have studied the world through the 

21
00:01:13,810 --> 00:01:14,090
eyes of statistics,
so let me ask you,

22
00:01:14,091 --> 00:01:18,770
in terms of the nature of reality,
fundamental nature of reality,

23
00:01:19,190 --> 00:01:20,420
does God play dice?

24
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:26,100
You don't know some fuck,
that's your course.

25
00:01:26,101 --> 00:01:29,450
You don't know some doctors which could 
be important.

26
00:01:30,540 --> 00:01:33,930
It looks like a good way,
nice,

27
00:01:35,090 --> 00:01:40,090
but we don't discourage it.
If you must distinguish between two 

28
00:01:41,250 --> 00:01:43,620
positions,
positions of instrument,

29
00:01:44,810 --> 00:01:49,810
where you're creating,
it will production in positional for 

30
00:01:49,810 --> 00:01:53,700
areas where you're trying to understand 
what God did,

31
00:01:54,650 --> 00:01:57,470
can you describe instrumental and 
realism a little bit?

32
00:01:58,420 --> 00:02:00,890
For example,
if you have some,

33
00:02:01,820 --> 00:02:06,820
because Nicole laws work is that is it 
low each through always and everywhere 

34
00:02:11,510 --> 00:02:16,510
or it is law which allow you to predict.
Position of moving element is what you 

35
00:02:22,011 --> 00:02:25,040
believe.
You believe that it is God's law.

36
00:02:25,710 --> 00:02:30,710
God created the world which are the two,
this physical law or it is just low for 

37
00:02:35,031 --> 00:02:37,580
predictions and which one is 
instrumental?

38
00:02:37,581 --> 00:02:42,581
Asm for predictions,
this is law of God.

39
00:02:43,590 --> 00:02:48,590
It isn't always true everywhere.
That means you're the artist so you're 

40
00:02:50,391 --> 00:02:50,990
trying to.

41
00:02:52,410 --> 00:02:53,910
I'm distant,
understands.

42
00:02:54,220 --> 00:02:59,220
Got Salt.
Say the way you see the world is as an 

43
00:02:59,220 --> 00:02:59,220
instrumentalist,

44
00:03:00,020 --> 00:03:02,660
you know,
are working for someone else,

45
00:03:03,250 --> 00:03:08,250
model of machine learning.
So in Zeus model you can see a second,

46
00:03:12,980 --> 00:03:17,980
the soul is the second assault is a 
problem and you can do in two different 

47
00:03:19,910 --> 00:03:24,910
way from the point of view of 
instrumentalists and that's what 

48
00:03:25,240 --> 00:03:27,820
everybody does,
not because,

49
00:03:28,100 --> 00:03:33,100
uh,
this is a goal of machine learning is a 

50
00:03:33,550 --> 00:03:38,550
find zero for clarification,
is that the bucket is instrument for 

51
00:03:39,780 --> 00:03:44,780
production,
but they can say Zygote of a machine 

52
00:03:45,611 --> 00:03:49,840
learning is to learn about conditional 
probability.

53
00:03:50,010 --> 00:03:55,010
So I have got played use in play.
What your probability for one,

54
00:03:55,980 --> 00:04:00,980
what is a given situation.
But for production,

55
00:04:01,181 --> 00:04:03,590
I don't need this.
I need zero,

56
00:04:04,240 --> 00:04:07,370
but for understanding I need 
conditioner.

57
00:04:08,490 --> 00:04:11,640
So let me just step back a little bit.
First to talk about,

58
00:04:11,820 --> 00:04:14,010
you mentioned,
which I read last night,

59
00:04:14,040 --> 00:04:19,040
the parts of the 1960 paper by a eugene,
a wagner,

60
00:04:20,790 --> 00:04:25,070
a unreasonable effectiveness of 
mathematics and natural sciences because

61
00:04:25,110 --> 00:04:28,680
you're such a beautiful paper by the 
way.

62
00:04:28,681 --> 00:04:33,681
You made me feel it to be honest,
to confess my own work in the past few 

63
00:04:35,550 --> 00:04:37,860
years on deep learning,
heavily applied,

64
00:04:38,430 --> 00:04:43,430
made me feel that I was missing out on 
some of the beauty of nature in the way 

65
00:04:44,011 --> 00:04:49,011
that math can uncover.
So let me just step away from the 

66
00:04:49,011 --> 00:04:53,720
poacher that for a second.
How do you see the role of math in your 

67
00:04:53,720 --> 00:04:57,501
life as it?
Is it a tool as a poetry where where 

68
00:04:57,501 --> 00:05:01,101
does it sit and does math for you?
Have limits of what it can describe

69
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:06,360
some people singing each user growth,
so I believe

70
00:05:10,120 --> 00:05:13,330
and that to God or use God used God.

71
00:05:14,030 --> 00:05:19,030
Yeah,
so I believe the zoo's article about 

72
00:05:24,291 --> 00:05:29,291
effectiveness,
unreasonable effectiveness of mass is 

73
00:05:29,291 --> 00:05:31,940
that if you're looking for in which a 
magical structures,

74
00:05:33,880 --> 00:05:38,880
so ignore something Kubota and 
scientists from natural science zero 

75
00:05:42,760 --> 00:05:47,760
looking on equation in trying to 
understand sort of the same in machine 

76
00:05:49,521 --> 00:05:54,160
learning.
If you really cared,

77
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:59,400
if we look on all the equations,
did you define conditional probability?

78
00:06:00,590 --> 00:06:04,220
You can understand something in both the
reality,

79
00:06:04,670 --> 00:06:07,760
more zen from your fantasy.

80
00:06:08,130 --> 00:06:13,110
So math can reveal the simple underlying
principles of reality.

81
00:06:13,111 --> 00:06:13,740
Perhaps

82
00:06:13,830 --> 00:06:18,780
you know what mean simple,
it is very hard to disclose,

83
00:06:20,310 --> 00:06:23,160
but then when you discover them and look
at them,

84
00:06:23,780 --> 00:06:28,780
you see a beautiful that are in it.
The surprising white people did not 

85
00:06:31,740 --> 00:06:36,630
choose that before you're looking 
equation derived from equations.

86
00:06:37,470 --> 00:06:42,470
For example,
I talked to yesterday about Netapp and 

87
00:06:43,560 --> 00:06:47,430
people had a lot of fantasy improve,
coordinate,

88
00:06:48,120 --> 00:06:51,750
but if you look going step by step by 
solving some equations,

89
00:06:52,350 --> 00:06:57,350
you're suddenly,
you get some term which of the sinking 

90
00:06:59,070 --> 00:07:04,070
your stands in describe position of 
observation point wrote a lot of 

91
00:07:07,021 --> 00:07:12,021
information.
You don't look in composition of points 

92
00:07:12,021 --> 00:07:14,040
of observations.
We're looking commonly on residuals,

93
00:07:14,580 --> 00:07:19,580
but when your understood that,
that's a very simple idea but not too 

94
00:07:20,430 --> 00:07:25,430
simple to understand.
And you can derive this just for 

95
00:07:25,430 --> 00:07:25,550
mcorigins.

96
00:07:25,650 --> 00:07:30,650
So some simple Algebra,
a few steps or take you to something 

97
00:07:30,650 --> 00:07:32,510
surprising that when you think about

98
00:07:33,130 --> 00:07:38,130
so am that is proof that human intuition
not to reach in very primitive and it 

99
00:07:42,911 --> 00:07:47,911
does not see where it says simple 
situations.

100
00:07:48,520 --> 00:07:48,970
So,

101
00:07:49,090 --> 00:07:51,530
oh,
let me take a step back in general.

102
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:53,300
Yes,
right.

103
00:07:53,390 --> 00:07:58,390
Uh,
but what about human as opposed to 

104
00:07:58,390 --> 00:07:58,940
intuition,
ingenuity,

105
00:07:59,540 --> 00:08:02,990
um,
moments of brilliance.

106
00:08:03,020 --> 00:08:05,690
So I use.
So,

107
00:08:06,350 --> 00:08:11,350
uh,
do you have to be so hard on human 

108
00:08:11,350 --> 00:08:13,631
intuition?
Are there moments of brilliance and 

109
00:08:13,631 --> 00:08:15,941
human intuition that can leap ahead of 
math and then the math will catch up?

110
00:08:17,350 --> 00:08:22,350
I don't think so.
I assume the best human intuition it is 

111
00:08:24,120 --> 00:08:29,120
putting in Oxford homes and technical 
where see where they axioms take you,

112
00:08:31,880 --> 00:08:36,880
but if they take actions but it ducks 
your Polish during generation or 

113
00:08:39,991 --> 00:08:43,270
scientist,
and this is integral,

114
00:08:45,080 --> 00:08:50,080
so that's beautifully put.
But if you maybe look at when you,

115
00:08:51,520 --> 00:08:56,520
when you think of Einstein and special,
well,

116
00:08:56,820 --> 00:09:01,820
what is the role of imagination coming 
first there in the moment of discovery 

117
00:09:02,611 --> 00:09:07,611
of an idea.
So there's obviously a mix of math and 

118
00:09:07,980 --> 00:09:09,810
out of the box imagination there

119
00:09:10,780 --> 00:09:15,780
that's a good goal or exclude you 
because whatever is so emotional 

120
00:09:20,180 --> 00:09:25,180
learning conference nation like futures,
like the deeper nick looked at it,

121
00:09:27,250 --> 00:09:32,250
what was a problem when you're looking 
vertically from Maki,

122
00:09:32,450 --> 00:09:34,670
magical liquidations,
you did arrive,

123
00:09:34,710 --> 00:09:38,560
been converted.
Simple story usually goes fall by God.

124
00:09:38,580 --> 00:09:42,520
It's good.
Then whatever people can imagine because

125
00:09:42,580 --> 00:09:47,580
it is not good frontage,
it is just interpretation is just fun 

126
00:09:47,660 --> 00:09:51,010
things,
but it is not what you need.

127
00:09:51,310 --> 00:09:56,310
You don't need any imagination to derive
a say.

128
00:09:56,951 --> 00:09:58,660
My principal of machine learning.

129
00:09:59,890 --> 00:10:02,350
When you think about learning and 
intelligence,

130
00:10:02,740 --> 00:10:07,740
maybe thinking about the human brain and
trying to describe mathematically the 

131
00:10:07,740 --> 00:10:08,570
process of learning,
uh,

132
00:10:09,220 --> 00:10:12,940
that is something like what happens in 
the human brain.

133
00:10:13,210 --> 00:10:15,670
Do you think we have the tools 
currently?

134
00:10:17,230 --> 00:10:22,230
Do you think we'll ever have the tools 
to try to describe that process of 

135
00:10:22,230 --> 00:10:22,230
learning?

136
00:10:22,230 --> 00:10:26,630
You descriptions was growing up.
It was interpretation.

137
00:10:27,340 --> 00:10:31,370
It is your interpretation.
Your vision can be wrong.

138
00:10:32,090 --> 00:10:37,090
You know,
when God microscope living book for the 

139
00:10:37,890 --> 00:10:41,620
first time just instrument and nobody 
will.

140
00:10:41,630 --> 00:10:46,630
He kept secret about microscope,
but he wrote reports in London sites and

141
00:10:49,290 --> 00:10:52,130
excuse the report.
When he looked and goes a blood heel.

142
00:10:52,170 --> 00:10:57,170
Look,
every barrels of water owns or blood on 

143
00:10:57,170 --> 00:10:59,840
him,
but he described blood like fight 

144
00:10:59,990 --> 00:11:04,990
between you and king.
So he saw blood cells,

145
00:11:07,310 --> 00:11:11,260
red cells and modules that is mute,
I think chose it.

146
00:11:12,460 --> 00:11:14,830
And before his interpretation of 
litigation,

147
00:11:17,030 --> 00:11:21,810
and she sent it yesterday in no signs 
and they are very creative for your look

148
00:11:21,830 --> 00:11:24,050
because they believes that he's right.
He's right.

149
00:11:24,080 --> 00:11:25,560
You saw something,
yes,

150
00:11:25,700 --> 00:11:29,960
but keep going from interpretation and 
they believe the same can happen.

151
00:11:30,460 --> 00:11:34,490
His brain,
what is the most important.

152
00:11:34,491 --> 00:11:38,240
But you know,
I believe in human language,

153
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:43,880
in some product is so much this.
For example,

154
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:50,200
people say that it is better than 
thousand days of diligence studies one 

155
00:11:51,771 --> 00:11:56,771
day this great.
But if I ask you what did you does?

156
00:11:57,610 --> 00:12:02,610
Nobody knows and that this intelligence 
and but we know from Houston and now 

157
00:12:05,550 --> 00:12:06,960
from,
from,

158
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:11,710
in machine learning is that teachers can
do a lot.

159
00:12:12,090 --> 00:12:15,630
So what from a mathematical point of 
view is the great teacher.

160
00:12:16,120 --> 00:12:18,830
I don't know.
That's not,

161
00:12:18,870 --> 00:12:23,870
not what have.
You can see what teachers can do.

162
00:12:25,150 --> 00:12:27,610
You can introduce some,
uh,

163
00:12:28,420 --> 00:12:33,040
some medicate for creating convergence.
Have you doing,

164
00:12:33,570 --> 00:12:38,570
I dunno because teacher nor seriality 
and can describe from this reality 

165
00:12:39,190 --> 00:12:44,190
predicate in variance.
But he knows that when you're using 

166
00:12:44,190 --> 00:12:47,200
convenient you can decrease the number 
of observations hundred times.

167
00:12:48,040 --> 00:12:48,430
That's

168
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:51,150
so,
but uh,

169
00:12:51,280 --> 00:12:52,990
maybe try to pull that apart a little 
bit.

170
00:12:52,991 --> 00:12:56,390
I think you mentioned a,
like a piano teacher saying,

171
00:12:56,410 --> 00:12:57,320
uh,
uh,

172
00:12:57,520 --> 00:13:00,670
to the student play like a butterfly and
I played piano.

173
00:13:00,671 --> 00:13:04,300
I play guitar for a long time and it,
yeah,

174
00:13:04,301 --> 00:13:08,710
that's theirs.
Maybe it's romantic,

175
00:13:08,740 --> 00:13:11,710
poetic,
but it feels like there's a lot of truth

176
00:13:11,711 --> 00:13:16,711
in that statement.
Like there is a lot of instruction to 

177
00:13:16,711 --> 00:13:17,350
that statement and so can you pull that 
apart?

178
00:13:17,380 --> 00:13:18,010
What is,
what,

179
00:13:18,070 --> 00:13:23,070
what is that?
The language itself may not contains 

180
00:13:23,070 --> 00:13:23,070
information.
Okay.

181
00:13:23,070 --> 00:13:25,000
Blah,
Blah Blah because blah,

182
00:13:25,050 --> 00:13:25,630
blah blah.
Yeah.

183
00:13:27,010 --> 00:13:29,640
It's what if you,
if you blank.

184
00:13:29,870 --> 00:13:31,430
Yes it does,
but what?

185
00:13:31,431 --> 00:13:34,800
It's not the lane.
It's if it feels like a,

186
00:13:34,801 --> 00:13:39,801
um,
what is the information being exchanged 

187
00:13:39,801 --> 00:13:39,830
and error?
What is the nature of information?

188
00:13:39,831 --> 00:13:41,900
What is the representation of that 
information?

189
00:13:41,940 --> 00:13:46,940
I believe sort of educated,
but I don't know exactly what work 

190
00:13:47,520 --> 00:13:49,350
intelligence and machine learning should
be.

191
00:13:49,550 --> 00:13:52,550
Yes.
Because this is just what you might call

192
00:13:53,900 --> 00:13:58,900
a.
What was discovered recently is that 

193
00:13:58,900 --> 00:14:03,900
there is offloading one called stone 
convergence mechanism and conversions.

194
00:14:07,610 --> 00:14:12,610
Macanese before people use only one.
If you can go just because using you can

195
00:14:13,861 --> 00:14:18,861
use educate,
that's what plainly bought the land and 

196
00:14:20,550 --> 00:14:25,550
if you immediately affect your plan,
you'll also see soon as English program.

197
00:14:26,400 --> 00:14:31,400
Great.
It looks like the dark sleeves like the 

198
00:14:31,400 --> 00:14:35,010
dark and walk like a duck then it is 
probably duck.

199
00:14:35,180 --> 00:14:37,910
Yes.
But this is exact.

200
00:14:38,890 --> 00:14:41,640
Put indicates.
Looks like a duck.

201
00:14:41,670 --> 00:14:43,230
What it means.
So you,

202
00:14:43,231 --> 00:14:47,670
so many dogs that you're training data.
So you're,

203
00:14:47,970 --> 00:14:52,970
you have description or hub looks.
Integral looks ducks.

204
00:14:56,500 --> 00:14:59,020
Yeah.
The visual characteristics of yard.

205
00:14:59,380 --> 00:15:00,610
Yeah.
But you won't.

206
00:15:00,820 --> 00:15:03,520
And you'll have modeled for,
you know,

207
00:15:04,210 --> 00:15:08,250
so you would like show that theoretical 
description for more.

208
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:12,850
The core site is empirical description 
each year.

209
00:15:12,851 --> 00:15:17,740
So on.
So about looks like the it general.

210
00:15:18,460 --> 00:15:20,470
But what about,
seems like a doc.

211
00:15:21,490 --> 00:15:24,970
You should know the dogs names.
You can say it.

212
00:15:24,971 --> 00:15:26,920
Play chess like a duck.
Okay.

213
00:15:26,980 --> 00:15:28,480
Doug doesn't relate.
Yes.

214
00:15:28,900 --> 00:15:33,060
And it is completely legal.
Educate,

215
00:15:33,160 --> 00:15:38,160
but it is useless.
So how teachers can recognize not 

216
00:15:39,161 --> 00:15:44,161
useless.
So up to now you don't use this in 

217
00:15:45,030 --> 00:15:50,030
existing machine a lot and you have data
but English forever use.

218
00:15:55,390 --> 00:16:00,390
It looks like a duck.
Seems like a duck and quacks collecting 

219
00:16:00,390 --> 00:16:00,390
that

220
00:16:00,390 --> 00:16:03,570
so you can't deny the fact that swims 
like a duck and quacks like a duck,

221
00:16:04,200 --> 00:16:08,040
has humor in it,
has an ambiguity.

222
00:16:08,520 --> 00:16:13,520
Let's talk about sitting duck in.
It doesn't say jumps,

223
00:16:14,500 --> 00:16:17,020
jumping duck.
Why?

224
00:16:17,710 --> 00:16:18,250
Because

225
00:16:18,310 --> 00:16:19,210
it's not relevant,

226
00:16:20,820 --> 00:16:22,600
but music,
you know,

227
00:16:22,840 --> 00:16:24,850
dogs,
you know,

228
00:16:24,880 --> 00:16:29,830
different doors you know,
and your mouth and you derive from it is

229
00:16:29,900 --> 00:16:31,840
really want to say,
say like in jail.

230
00:16:32,400 --> 00:16:36,060
So underneath,
in order for us to understand swims like

231
00:16:36,061 --> 00:16:41,061
a duck,
it feels like we need to know millions 

232
00:16:41,061 --> 00:16:44,340
of other little pieces of information we
pick up along the way.

233
00:16:44,341 --> 00:16:46,020
You don't think so that doesn't need to 
be.

234
00:16:46,021 --> 00:16:51,021
This knowledge base in those statements 
carries some rich information that helps

235
00:16:53,221 --> 00:16:55,440
us understand the essence of duck.
Yeah.

236
00:16:57,300 --> 00:17:01,380
How far are we from integrating a 
product gets,

237
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:03,580
you know,
when,

238
00:17:03,670 --> 00:17:06,400
when you consider complete sewer 
machine.

239
00:17:07,360 --> 00:17:10,990
So what does you have?
A lot of functions.

240
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:13,670
And then you're,
you're,

241
00:17:13,720 --> 00:17:16,270
you're talking,
it looks like a duck.

242
00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:21,750
You see your three new data from 
training data.

243
00:17:21,760 --> 00:17:24,210
You recognize his life.
Uh,

244
00:17:26,450 --> 00:17:31,450
expected dark should look all functions 
did,

245
00:17:33,750 --> 00:17:38,750
you,
does not look like you think it should 

246
00:17:38,750 --> 00:17:43,051
look from staining it.
So you could use a multifunction from 

247
00:17:43,070 --> 00:17:48,070
vhp pickup,
what you a second predicate and they pay

248
00:17:49,060 --> 00:17:52,560
this could decrease the second function 
enough to that.

249
00:17:52,590 --> 00:17:55,980
You a function,
you can find it.

250
00:17:55,981 --> 00:18:00,981
Just stunned that machine learning.
So why are you need not too many 

251
00:18:00,981 --> 00:18:01,740
examples

252
00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:04,770
is your products aren't very good,

253
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:08,470
Mrs.
Yeah,

254
00:18:09,210 --> 00:18:14,210
because every political is invented to 
decrease it leaseable set of function.

255
00:18:17,720 --> 00:18:20,360
So you talk about admissible set of 
functions.

256
00:18:20,361 --> 00:18:24,260
Can you talk about good functions?
So what makes a good function?

257
00:18:24,280 --> 00:18:28,000
So admissible set of function is circle 
function.

258
00:18:28,630 --> 00:18:32,790
You chose small capacity of small 
diversity.

259
00:18:33,040 --> 00:18:36,580
She did mention except did you continue 
to good function,

260
00:18:36,600 --> 00:18:36,910
etc.

261
00:18:36,970 --> 00:18:38,770
So by the way,
for people who don't know,

262
00:18:38,810 --> 00:18:42,400
vc,
you're the v in the vc.

263
00:18:43,580 --> 00:18:44,920
Uh,
uh.

264
00:18:44,921 --> 00:18:45,730
So,
uh,

265
00:18:46,210 --> 00:18:49,130
how would you describe to a lay person?
What vc theories,

266
00:18:49,140 --> 00:18:51,580
uh,
how would you describe these?

267
00:18:51,940 --> 00:18:56,940
We're mushroom,
so machine capable to pick up one 

268
00:18:58,511 --> 00:19:00,840
function from zed miscible,
settler reflection.

269
00:19:02,580 --> 00:19:07,580
But certified miserables function can be
contained.

270
00:19:08,800 --> 00:19:13,800
All continuous functions in useless.
you don't have so many examples to pick 

271
00:19:13,971 --> 00:19:16,540
up watch,
but it can be small,

272
00:19:17,320 --> 00:19:19,610
small,
uh,

273
00:19:20,500 --> 00:19:23,920
because capacity,
but maybe better diversity,

274
00:19:24,610 --> 00:19:29,610
so not very different function in the 
function but not very diverse.

275
00:19:31,320 --> 00:19:35,220
So if it's small,
you shouldn't mention when you mentioned

276
00:19:35,230 --> 00:19:40,230
a small union,
you union smaller moment of training 

277
00:19:40,500 --> 00:19:45,500
data sources.
The goal is to create admissible set of 

278
00:19:46,001 --> 00:19:51,001
functions.
Ditch is small vishy dimension and 

279
00:19:51,461 --> 00:19:54,370
contained good zoom.
You should use it.

280
00:19:54,460 --> 00:19:59,460
You'll be able to pick up the function 
using a small amount of sort of

281
00:20:02,340 --> 00:20:07,340
is that,
that is the task of learning is creating

282
00:20:08,131 --> 00:20:12,960
a set of admissible functions as a small
vc dimension.

283
00:20:13,110 --> 00:20:16,530
And then you've figured out a clever way
of picking up

284
00:20:17,390 --> 00:20:21,610
the is that this goal of learning which 
a fully formulated yesterday?

285
00:20:21,660 --> 00:20:26,660
Yep.
Statistical learning surgery does not 

286
00:20:26,660 --> 00:20:30,730
involved in creating admissible set.
The function in classical learning 

287
00:20:31,581 --> 00:20:36,581
surgery everywhere.
Hundred percent in textbook is a set of 

288
00:20:36,581 --> 00:20:38,450
function.
Admissible central function is given,

289
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:44,200
but this is both nothing because the 
most difficult problem to create 

290
00:20:44,691 --> 00:20:49,691
admissible setup functions given see a 
lot of functions continuum set up,

291
00:20:52,210 --> 00:20:54,970
auction create admissible central 
functions.

292
00:20:54,971 --> 00:20:59,971
That's been the key is finding it to be 
small and contained good function.

293
00:21:02,210 --> 00:21:04,960
So this was out of consideration.

294
00:21:05,240 --> 00:21:07,460
So what's the process of doing that?
I mean,

295
00:21:07,461 --> 00:21:10,340
it's fascinating.
What is the process of creating this,

296
00:21:10,900 --> 00:21:15,900
um,
admissible set of functions that's in 

297
00:21:15,900 --> 00:21:17,180
various.
can you describe the variance

298
00:21:18,490 --> 00:21:23,490
of appropriate use of data in a proper 
just means is that you have some 

299
00:21:28,650 --> 00:21:32,730
function in your,
you're just cold.

300
00:21:33,270 --> 00:21:38,270
What does your aVerage,
your function on your kind of model in 

301
00:21:41,881 --> 00:21:44,180
what is the expectation of this function
on some,

302
00:21:44,500 --> 00:21:49,500
on set so that the problem was bold.
HaVe to piCk up functions.

303
00:21:51,710 --> 00:21:54,520
It can be in yoU.
Fuck you,

304
00:21:56,620 --> 00:22:01,620
fuck you for all functions.
But because when talking,

305
00:22:04,680 --> 00:22:09,480
see doug does not jumping so you don't 
ask questions,

306
00:22:09,510 --> 00:22:14,510
jump like a duck because if this three 
really doesn't the junk and from doesn't

307
00:22:14,790 --> 00:22:19,790
help you mature nor something vg task 
you're asking for you like figure it 

308
00:22:23,490 --> 00:22:28,490
like a duck but looks like a duck.
It haS general looks like see go.

309
00:22:31,201 --> 00:22:35,010
Who covers his illness?
Is this disease?

310
00:22:35,500 --> 00:22:38,490
It says legal.
Yeah.

311
00:22:38,910 --> 00:22:43,910
So there is a general type of political 
groups like in specific special nikki,

312
00:22:47,280 --> 00:22:52,280
which he related to this specific and 
his intelligence,

313
00:22:52,381 --> 00:22:55,740
but also business and that were teachers
involved.

314
00:22:56,310 --> 00:23:00,120
Incorporating the specialized predicates
a.

315
00:23:00,570 --> 00:23:03,650
Okay.
What do you think about deep learning as

316
00:23:04,530 --> 00:23:09,300
a neural networks,
these arbitrary architectures as helping

317
00:23:09,301 --> 00:23:14,301
accomplish some of the tasks you're 
thinking about their effectiveness or 

318
00:23:14,341 --> 00:23:15,420
lack thereof?
what are,

319
00:23:15,840 --> 00:23:19,410
what are the weaknesses and what are the
possible strengths?

320
00:23:20,140 --> 00:23:22,020
No,
this is fun.

321
00:23:23,460 --> 00:23:28,230
Everybody seems huge.
Deep learning like futures.

322
00:23:29,130 --> 00:23:34,130
Let me give you this example.
One of the greatest book is churchill 

323
00:23:36,090 --> 00:23:40,680
book about history of second world war 
and he starting this book,

324
00:23:41,760 --> 00:23:46,730
describing that in old time when the war
is over,

325
00:23:48,020 --> 00:23:53,020
so the great kings together,
almost all of them were relatives and 

326
00:23:58,181 --> 00:24:03,181
they discuss what should be done,
have to create peace and they came to an

327
00:24:04,101 --> 00:24:09,101
agreement in what happens for the 
general public came in,

328
00:24:12,660 --> 00:24:17,660
bought in.
They were so good that rope Germany and 

329
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:23,400
it was clear for everybody that it is 
not peace that peaceful last only 20 

330
00:24:23,661 --> 00:24:28,661
years because they was not professionals
in the same way.

331
00:24:29,451 --> 00:24:33,520
She in machine learning zarama,
zara mathematicians,

332
00:24:33,860 --> 00:24:38,860
we're looking for the problem from a 
very deep point of your magical point 

333
00:24:39,990 --> 00:24:44,990
and zara computer scientists,
there's mostly does not know market is.

334
00:24:46,370 --> 00:24:51,370
They just have interpretation of that 
and they invented a lot of blablabla 

335
00:24:51,630 --> 00:24:56,600
interpretations like deep learning,
deep learning does not know.

336
00:24:56,601 --> 00:25:00,590
Deploying which you might have,
does not know a neurons.

337
00:25:00,770 --> 00:25:05,390
It is just function if you like to say 
piecewise linear function,

338
00:25:05,391 --> 00:25:10,220
say that and do it in class of piecewise
linear function,

339
00:25:10,820 --> 00:25:15,820
but they went something and then they 
try to to to proof advantage of that 

340
00:25:18,740 --> 00:25:23,740
through interpretations which mostly 
wrong and again they appeal to brain 

341
00:25:25,750 --> 00:25:29,840
which they know nothing about that 
nobody knows what god can break,

342
00:25:30,350 --> 00:25:34,110
so I think that more reliable woke en 
masse.

343
00:25:34,610 --> 00:25:38,710
There's as much scope problem or do your
best to solve this problem.

344
00:25:39,440 --> 00:25:44,440
Try to understand that there is no only 
one way of convergence which is strong 

345
00:25:45,130 --> 00:25:49,610
wave of euphoria of conductors which 
requires predicate.

346
00:25:49,920 --> 00:25:54,920
If you will go through all this stuff,
you will see that you don't need even 

347
00:25:56,841 --> 00:26:00,500
more.
I was one of the tour him.

348
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:06,000
Each color presented theory.
It says that optimal solution of logical

349
00:26:09,840 --> 00:26:12,320
problem,
which is,

350
00:26:12,900 --> 00:26:17,900
would you describe lord ngukurr,
his own shuttle network,

351
00:26:19,520 --> 00:26:22,320
not on deep learning and a shower.
Again,

352
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:24,770
problem is there.
Absolutely.

353
00:26:24,771 --> 00:26:28,580
So in the end,
what you're saying is exactly right.

354
00:26:29,330 --> 00:26:34,330
The question is,
you have no value for throwing something

355
00:26:34,401 --> 00:26:37,670
on the table playing with it,
not math.

356
00:26:38,080 --> 00:26:43,080
So like in your network or you said 
throwing something in the bucket and 

357
00:26:43,080 --> 00:26:43,080
our,
um,

358
00:26:43,080 --> 00:26:46,140
by the biological example in looking at 
kings and queens with the cells,

359
00:26:46,141 --> 00:26:51,141
with a microscope you don't see value in
imagining the cells are kings and 

360
00:26:51,271 --> 00:26:56,271
queens.
And using that as inspiration and 

361
00:26:56,271 --> 00:26:58,860
imagination for where the math will 
eventually lead you.

362
00:26:59,070 --> 00:27:04,070
You think that interpretation,
who was basically deceives you in a way 

363
00:27:04,171 --> 00:27:05,310
that's not productive

364
00:27:06,340 --> 00:27:11,340
are soon.
If you're on the laws of nature,

365
00:27:12,620 --> 00:27:17,620
of a spiritually discussion about 
deploying it was discussion about 

366
00:27:19,531 --> 00:27:23,730
interpretation.
Not the boat sinks your boat.

367
00:27:23,760 --> 00:27:25,690
What you can say about sings.

368
00:27:26,110 --> 00:27:31,110
That's right.
But aren't you surprised by the beauty 

369
00:27:31,110 --> 00:27:31,110
of it?
So the,

370
00:27:31,110 --> 00:27:31,110
the,
the,

371
00:27:31,110 --> 00:27:32,560
uh,
not mathematical beauty,

372
00:27:32,561 --> 00:27:37,561
but the fact that it Works at all,
or are you criticizing that very beauty?

373
00:27:38,921 --> 00:27:43,921
Our human desire to,
to interpret,

374
00:27:44,540 --> 00:27:49,540
to find our silly,
silly interpretations and these 

375
00:27:49,540 --> 00:27:50,650
constructs like,
let me ask you this,

376
00:27:51,280 --> 00:27:56,280
are you surprised in that?
Does it inspire you or how do you feel 

377
00:27:57,641 --> 00:28:02,641
about the success of a system like 
alphago beating the game of go using 

378
00:28:04,120 --> 00:28:09,120
neural networks to estimate the quality 
of a board of a board and the quality of

379
00:28:11,141 --> 00:28:14,830
the interpretation coordinator support?
Yeah.

380
00:28:15,070 --> 00:28:19,840
Yes.
So it's not our interpretation.

381
00:28:20,230 --> 00:28:22,540
The fact is,
and you're on our system,

382
00:28:22,541 --> 00:28:25,930
doesn't matter.
A learning system that we don't.

383
00:28:25,931 --> 00:28:30,931
I think mathematically understand that 
well beat the best human player does 

384
00:28:30,931 --> 00:28:30,931
something that was,

385
00:28:32,100 --> 00:28:33,260
it's not very difficult.

386
00:28:34,210 --> 00:28:39,210
That's so you empiric.
we've empirically have discovered that 

387
00:28:39,210 --> 00:28:42,670
this is not a very difficult problem.
It's true.

388
00:28:42,980 --> 00:28:46,990
Uh,
so maybe can't argue.

389
00:28:47,040 --> 00:28:49,990
Uh,
so

390
00:28:50,180 --> 00:28:54,070
you would more obviously the user uses 
the polluting.

391
00:28:54,730 --> 00:28:59,730
It is not the most effective way of 
learning theory and usually when people 

392
00:29:02,181 --> 00:29:07,181
use the learning using zillions of 
training data,

393
00:29:10,300 --> 00:29:15,300
but you don't need this.
So I guess challenge generally do some 

394
00:29:17,270 --> 00:29:22,270
problems.
Did you do real deep learning method?

395
00:29:22,880 --> 00:29:27,880
You are using contract terms lists even 
more.

396
00:29:29,490 --> 00:29:34,490
Some problems deploying cannot solve 
because it's not necessarily z create 

397
00:29:38,700 --> 00:29:41,550
admissible set of function.
When creek

398
00:29:42,030 --> 00:29:45,310
deep architecture muesli created 
miscible set of functions,

399
00:29:45,730 --> 00:29:48,480
you cannot say that you create in good,
admissible setup,

400
00:29:50,210 --> 00:29:53,990
you're just a ceo fantasy.
It does not come from us,

401
00:29:54,820 --> 00:29:59,140
but it is possible to create ugly 
stubble set of functions and because you

402
00:29:59,141 --> 00:30:04,141
have a training data that the actually 
for magicians,

403
00:30:04,760 --> 00:30:08,060
a run,
you're considering warrior,

404
00:30:08,360 --> 00:30:13,360
you need to use law of large numbers 
when you making training in existing 

405
00:30:16,490 --> 00:30:19,990
algorithm,
uniform law of large numbers,

406
00:30:20,710 --> 00:30:24,490
which is much more difficult to acquire.
So we said imagine and all that stuff,

407
00:30:25,060 --> 00:30:30,060
but never the less.
If you use morse code stroke way of 

408
00:30:32,291 --> 00:30:34,830
convergence,
you can decrease a lot of training data.

409
00:30:34,980 --> 00:30:36,420
Yeah,
you could do the three.

410
00:30:36,480 --> 00:30:39,090
This one was like a duck,
quacks like a duck,

411
00:30:39,570 --> 00:30:41,730
but are.
So let's,

412
00:30:41,750 --> 00:30:45,780
let's,
let's step back and think about intel.

413
00:30:45,810 --> 00:30:50,810
Human intelligence in general.
Clearly that has evolved in a non 

414
00:30:51,421 --> 00:30:54,690
mathematical way.
It wasn't,

415
00:30:54,750 --> 00:30:56,790
uh,
as far as we know,

416
00:30:57,210 --> 00:30:58,310
uh,
god,

417
00:30:58,340 --> 00:30:59,210
uh,
or,

418
00:30:59,230 --> 00:31:04,230
or,
or whoever didn't come up with a model 

419
00:31:04,230 --> 00:31:05,850
in place in our brain of admissible 
functions.

420
00:31:05,851 --> 00:31:07,110
It kind of evolved.
I don't know,

421
00:31:07,111 --> 00:31:08,700
maybe you have a view on this,
but.

422
00:31:09,600 --> 00:31:13,290
So alan turing in the fifties,
in his paper,

423
00:31:13,291 --> 00:31:18,291
I'm asked and rejected the question,
can machines think it's not a very 

424
00:31:18,291 --> 00:31:22,881
useful question,
but can you briefly entertain this 

425
00:31:22,881 --> 00:31:23,370
useful,
useless question.

426
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:28,110
Can machines think?
So talk about intelligence and your vieW

427
00:31:28,111 --> 00:31:28,500
of it.

428
00:31:28,610 --> 00:31:31,370
I don't know.
Hearing,

429
00:31:32,210 --> 00:31:37,210
describe imitation computer can imitate 
human being.

430
00:31:39,740 --> 00:31:44,740
Let's call it intelligent and he 
understands that it is not sinking 

431
00:31:44,991 --> 00:31:46,040
computer.
Yes.

432
00:31:46,440 --> 00:31:51,440
He completely understand what he does,
but he's set up problem of imitation so 

433
00:31:54,160 --> 00:31:56,570
long.
He understands that the problem,

434
00:31:56,571 --> 00:32:01,571
not in limitation.
I'm not sure that intelligence just 

435
00:32:02,481 --> 00:32:06,170
inside of us.
It might be all soft side of us.

436
00:32:06,710 --> 00:32:11,710
I have several observations.
So when they approved some sodium,

437
00:32:13,500 --> 00:32:14,180
difficult,
sorry,

438
00:32:15,160 --> 00:32:20,160
a couple of years in several places,
people pull off the same sorta loma 

439
00:32:24,260 --> 00:32:29,260
after ours was done in other guys in the
history of science.

440
00:32:30,261 --> 00:32:33,050
It's happened all the time.
For example,

441
00:32:33,300 --> 00:32:38,300
john certain similar foster did a little
and goals and [inaudible] and another 

442
00:32:42,050 --> 00:32:47,050
guy in the approximately in 10 times 
video taped up the spirit of time.

443
00:32:48,520 --> 00:32:53,520
If they saw a lot of examples like that 
in which my tuition wednesday develop 

444
00:32:54,951 --> 00:32:59,951
something big sampson,
congenital ditch effect everybody.

445
00:33:01,430 --> 00:33:06,430
So maybe you're our models.
It intelligence only inside the foss is 

446
00:33:06,430 --> 00:33:08,480
incorrect.
It's our interpretation.

447
00:33:08,600 --> 00:33:12,920
Yeah.
It might be some connection.

448
00:33:13,590 --> 00:33:16,490
You wold intelligence,
I don't know.

449
00:33:16,570 --> 00:33:19,850
You're almost like plugging in into a.
Yeah,

450
00:33:19,851 --> 00:33:24,851
exactly.
And contributing to this network to a 

451
00:33:24,851 --> 00:33:26,180
big maybe in your own network.

452
00:33:28,250 --> 00:33:33,250
And the flip side of that,
maybe you can comment on a big old 

453
00:33:33,921 --> 00:33:38,840
complexity in how you see classifying 
algorithms by worst case,

454
00:33:38,841 --> 00:33:43,841
running time in relation to their input.
So that way of thinking about functions.

455
00:33:45,620 --> 00:33:47,750
Do you think p equals np?
Do you think?

456
00:33:47,751 --> 00:33:51,440
That's an interesting question.
It was interesting coalition,

457
00:33:51,800 --> 00:33:56,800
but let me talk about complexity.
In the worst case scenario,

458
00:34:01,760 --> 00:34:06,760
zoos in which you might circle setting 
when they came to the United States in 

459
00:34:06,760 --> 00:34:11,081
1990,
so people did not know this show is I 

460
00:34:11,081 --> 00:34:15,031
get not no statistical lot.
So in Russia it was published two 

461
00:34:15,600 --> 00:34:16,810
motocross.
Oh,

462
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:21,190
one more grass,
but in America said that no zinzi lord,

463
00:34:22,970 --> 00:34:26,010
and somebody told me the worst case 
scenario,

464
00:34:26,290 --> 00:34:27,220
create three.
Okay,

465
00:34:27,230 --> 00:34:32,230
so what do it not,
because it is much in what's called 

466
00:34:32,960 --> 00:34:37,960
tool.
You can do only what you can do using 

467
00:34:37,960 --> 00:34:42,080
the markings and ditch [inaudible] a 
clear understanding and clear 

468
00:34:42,591 --> 00:34:47,591
description and for some reason the 
introduce complexity and didn't he just 

469
00:34:54,580 --> 00:34:59,580
because using.
Actually it is diverse like this one 

470
00:35:01,190 --> 00:35:04,190
more dimension.
You can pro sodiums,

471
00:35:05,090 --> 00:35:10,090
but we also create order for case when 
you low probability to measure is that 

472
00:35:13,070 --> 00:35:15,720
the best case which can happen at the 
same therapy.

473
00:35:16,040 --> 00:35:21,040
Stability.
So from which you might scope point of 

474
00:35:21,040 --> 00:35:24,570
view,
you know the best possible case is the 

475
00:35:24,570 --> 00:35:27,921
worst possible case.
You can have different model in medium 

476
00:35:28,490 --> 00:35:32,940
but not so interesting.
You think that the edges are interesting

477
00:35:33,210 --> 00:35:35,760
and yeah,
just because

478
00:35:38,480 --> 00:35:42,440
it is not so easy to get

479
00:35:42,630 --> 00:35:44,230
good bob,
exact boat.

480
00:35:44,520 --> 00:35:49,520
It's not my crisis or where you up,
but interesting principles.

481
00:35:51,810 --> 00:35:56,810
Did you discover the moss?
Do you think it's interesting because 

482
00:35:56,810 --> 00:36:01,611
it's challenging and reveals interesting
principles that allow you to get those 

483
00:36:01,611 --> 00:36:04,500
bounds?
Or do you think it's interesting because

484
00:36:04,501 --> 00:36:09,501
it's actually very useful for 
understanding the essence of a function 

485
00:36:09,501 --> 00:36:09,780
of a,
of an algorithm.

486
00:36:10,950 --> 00:36:15,950
So it's like me judging your life as a 
human Being by the worst thing he did in

487
00:36:17,371 --> 00:36:20,640
the best thing he did versus all the 
stuff in the middle.

488
00:36:21,720 --> 00:36:24,540
It seems a not productive

489
00:36:25,510 --> 00:36:30,510
are those things.
So because you can not describe the 

490
00:36:30,510 --> 00:36:33,960
situation in the middle or not general.
So you can describe it just,

491
00:36:38,910 --> 00:36:43,910
and it is clear because some model,
but you cannot describe model for every 

492
00:36:45,611 --> 00:36:49,010
new case.
So you're,

493
00:36:49,100 --> 00:36:52,690
you'll be nervous when you're using

494
00:36:52,750 --> 00:36:55,090
mortal.
But from a statistical point of view,

495
00:36:55,091 --> 00:36:56,930
the way you've studied,
uh,

496
00:36:57,250 --> 00:37:01,870
functions and,
and the nature of learning in the world,

497
00:37:01,930 --> 00:37:06,640
don't you think that the real world has 
a very long tail,

498
00:37:07,450 --> 00:37:12,450
that the edge cases are very far away 
from the mean the stuff in the middle 

499
00:37:16,790 --> 00:37:17,270
or.
No,

500
00:37:20,870 --> 00:37:25,870
because as soon as you,
which from my point of view,

501
00:37:30,160 --> 00:37:35,160
if you use formal statistic,
you uniform wolf lodge,

502
00:37:40,240 --> 00:37:45,240
if you will use,
is this in avoidance business,

503
00:37:48,310 --> 00:37:53,310
you've just flushed homeless.
You don't have this huge difference 

504
00:37:53,481 --> 00:37:54,540
between uniform law.

505
00:37:56,700 --> 00:38:00,840
Is it useful to describe that a little 
more or it will show we just take it to,

506
00:38:01,740 --> 00:38:03,150
for example,
when,

507
00:38:03,280 --> 00:38:07,740
when talking about doc I give city 
pretty dedicated enough.

508
00:38:09,600 --> 00:38:14,600
but if you try to distinguish,
you didn't need a lot of observing.

509
00:38:17,680 --> 00:38:18,330
Uh,

510
00:38:18,830 --> 00:38:21,740
and so does that means,
is that information?

511
00:38:21,990 --> 00:38:26,990
It looks like a duck contained a lot of 
information form of bits of information.

512
00:38:29,660 --> 00:38:32,240
So if you don't know thAt,

513
00:38:32,990 --> 00:38:35,180
how much bit of information

514
00:38:36,330 --> 00:38:40,210
sinks from artificial intelligence is 
that,

515
00:38:40,211 --> 00:38:43,650
does this album,
you know,

516
00:38:46,020 --> 00:38:51,020
old business are.
I don't like cuff people and she the 

517
00:38:52,620 --> 00:38:57,620
artificial intelligence is consider us 
some quotes which imitate activity or 

518
00:38:59,430 --> 00:39:02,280
human being.
It is not science,

519
00:39:02,800 --> 00:39:05,160
which is applications you would like to 
imitate.

520
00:39:05,210 --> 00:39:08,990
Go heretic is very useful.
It was problem,

521
00:39:09,450 --> 00:39:10,080
but

522
00:39:11,680 --> 00:39:16,680
junior to to to lord substance more have
people try to do cricket.

523
00:39:18,690 --> 00:39:23,690
People came to see a pretty face,
so you just like a dock or play like 

524
00:39:26,460 --> 00:39:31,460
butterfly or something like that.
The teacher says you have it came in his

525
00:39:33,111 --> 00:39:38,111
mind how he chooses.
So that process is problem of 

526
00:39:38,811 --> 00:39:41,810
intelligence.
That is the problem of intel and you see

527
00:39:41,811 --> 00:39:46,811
that connected to the problem of 
learning options are they requested you 

528
00:39:46,811 --> 00:39:51,480
immediately gives us predicate like a 
specific predicate streams,

529
00:39:51,530 --> 00:39:56,460
like a dark hole.
You just choose it somehow.

530
00:39:57,440 --> 00:40:00,170
So what is the line of work would you 
say?

531
00:40:01,270 --> 00:40:06,270
If you were to formulate it as a set of 
open problems that will take us there,

532
00:40:07,910 --> 00:40:08,990
will play.
Look,

533
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:13,730
a butterfly will get a system to be able
to look at two stories,

534
00:40:14,330 --> 00:40:18,130
one story,
the predicate.

535
00:40:18,200 --> 00:40:23,200
You can do something.
Then those stories have to get 

536
00:40:23,200 --> 00:40:26,980
predicate.
It is intelligence problem and people 

537
00:40:28,280 --> 00:40:33,280
even did not start the understanding 
because to understand intelligence,

538
00:40:34,260 --> 00:40:39,260
the full try to understand what do 
teachers of teacher teach via one 

539
00:40:41,810 --> 00:40:44,330
teacher butlers in another one.
Yup.

540
00:40:44,450 --> 00:40:49,450
And so you,
you think we're really even haven't 

541
00:40:49,450 --> 00:40:50,440
started on the journey of regenerating 
the protocols.

542
00:40:50,830 --> 00:40:54,790
You don't understand.
You don't understand this problem exist

543
00:40:56,600 --> 00:40:59,640
because did you,
do you know,

544
00:40:59,800 --> 00:41:04,800
are you just normal name and I won't 
understand a why one tissue,

545
00:41:06,110 --> 00:41:11,110
but in a teacher student,
not because he repeating zipparo boom,

546
00:41:16,301 --> 00:41:18,190
which isn't textbook.
Yes,

547
00:41:18,410 --> 00:41:22,400
she makes somebody marks.
She makes some philosophy of,

548
00:41:22,980 --> 00:41:24,470
you know,
that's a beautiful.

549
00:41:24,530 --> 00:41:29,530
So it is a formulation of a question 
that is the open problem.

550
00:41:31,280 --> 00:41:35,870
Why is one teacher better than right?
What she does,

551
00:41:35,871 --> 00:41:38,420
but yeah.
What,

552
00:41:38,490 --> 00:41:39,060
what,
what,

553
00:41:39,620 --> 00:41:40,370
what,
why?

554
00:41:40,390 --> 00:41:44,480
In every level people,
how do they get better?

555
00:41:44,810 --> 00:41:49,200
What does it mean to be better?
The whole?

556
00:41:49,280 --> 00:41:49,960
Yeah.
Yeah.

557
00:41:50,330 --> 00:41:52,840
From,
from whatever model I have,

558
00:41:53,990 --> 00:41:56,670
one teacher can give a very good 
predicate.

559
00:41:56,700 --> 00:42:00,850
My pitcher can say a severe selected doc
and it does,

560
00:42:00,851 --> 00:42:05,851
it can say jump like a duck and jump 
like conducts cut a zero in front of me.

561
00:42:07,100 --> 00:42:07,340
Yeah.

562
00:42:09,280 --> 00:42:14,280
So what is the most exciting problem and
statistical learning you've ever worked 

563
00:42:14,280 --> 00:42:14,980
on or are working on now?

564
00:42:16,270 --> 00:42:21,270
Oh,
I just feel years is either on story.

565
00:42:24,630 --> 00:42:29,630
I believe zipped it is loading story.
At least they can shows is that it 

566
00:42:34,070 --> 00:42:39,070
doesn't nick nicole only what zay say 
statistical bought from intelligent and 

567
00:42:45,070 --> 00:42:50,070
they know nothing about intelligent and 
you know there's intelligent bot so it 

568
00:42:53,071 --> 00:42:58,071
you'll help us a lot in teaching in the 
learning.

569
00:43:00,480 --> 00:43:03,810
so we'll know it when we see it.
So for example,

570
00:43:04,090 --> 00:43:06,600
in my talks,
the last slide was a challenge.

571
00:43:06,990 --> 00:43:11,990
So you have say nist digitalization 
problem and deploy new claims.

572
00:43:13,981 --> 00:43:18,981
If they did it very well,
say 99 point five percent of it correct 

573
00:43:20,401 --> 00:43:23,320
answers,
but say you're 60,000

574
00:43:23,330 --> 00:43:24,680
to observational.
Yeah.

575
00:43:25,170 --> 00:43:30,170
Can you lose a sale user called 
defenseless but incorporating things in 

576
00:43:30,810 --> 00:43:32,100
variance.
What it means,

577
00:43:32,130 --> 00:43:33,790
you know,
digital want to see.

578
00:43:33,820 --> 00:43:38,820
But yeah,
just looking concert explained the 

579
00:43:38,820 --> 00:43:42,820
vision.
The orientation would keep to use 

580
00:43:42,820 --> 00:43:46,560
examples or say 100 times less examples 
to do the same job.

581
00:43:48,400 --> 00:43:51,820
Yeah,
that last slide in a.

582
00:43:51,850 --> 00:43:55,030
Unfortunately you're talking too 
quickly,

583
00:43:55,031 --> 00:44:00,031
but that last slide was a powerful open 
challenge and a formulation of the 

584
00:44:01,361 --> 00:44:02,790
essence does exactly

585
00:44:02,880 --> 00:44:06,680
problem often the diligence because

586
00:44:08,740 --> 00:44:13,740
everybody,
when nick started it was working with 

587
00:44:13,860 --> 00:44:18,860
too much emotion.
Z immediately recognize that views use 

588
00:44:18,860 --> 00:44:21,320
much more a trading datas of human 
needed.

589
00:44:22,430 --> 00:44:23,250
but no,
again,

590
00:44:23,280 --> 00:44:26,550
we came to the same study have to 
decrease.

591
00:44:27,130 --> 00:44:30,900
Is that this problem of loading?
It does,

592
00:44:31,170 --> 00:44:34,960
like in deploying the z subterranean 
date,

593
00:44:35,790 --> 00:44:38,070
the cost,
my resilience of not enough.

594
00:44:38,430 --> 00:44:42,810
If you have a good,
uh,

595
00:44:42,910 --> 00:44:47,910
invariance might be,
you'll never collect some observations,

596
00:44:49,380 --> 00:44:54,380
but now it is a question to,
to intelligence have to do that because 

597
00:44:56,191 --> 00:45:01,191
statistical part is in here.
As soon as your suppliers this 

598
00:45:01,240 --> 00:45:05,090
predicament,
you can do good job in a small amount of

599
00:45:05,370 --> 00:45:10,370
observations as a very first challenges 
will know digital coordination and you 

600
00:45:11,231 --> 00:45:14,070
know,
digits and police,

601
00:45:14,580 --> 00:45:19,580
there'll be variance.
I think that they can say four digit 

602
00:45:19,580 --> 00:45:23,340
city.
I would introduce concept of horizontal 

603
00:45:24,031 --> 00:45:29,031
symmetry.
So it was a digital has horizontals,

604
00:45:29,150 --> 00:45:32,940
symmetry say malls and say digital or 
something like that.

605
00:45:34,440 --> 00:45:37,890
but as soon as I get the deal is 
announced symmetry,

606
00:45:38,250 --> 00:45:43,250
I can watch a lot of measure your senior
year or the organon cemetery or 

607
00:45:46,621 --> 00:45:48,720
whatever,
if I could ever deal cbt,

608
00:45:49,860 --> 00:45:54,860
but foretells looking on on on digital 
use it.

609
00:45:55,260 --> 00:45:57,520
It is mit,
the mit,

610
00:45:57,650 --> 00:46:02,650
the predicate which is not shape the 
subsidy lake cemetery,

611
00:46:07,350 --> 00:46:10,130
like half dark.
His whole pictures,

612
00:46:10,131 --> 00:46:15,131
something like that each can sell for as
a predicate.

613
00:46:16,170 --> 00:46:21,170
You think such a predicate could rise of
something that's a

614
00:46:25,660 --> 00:46:28,270
not general meaning

615
00:46:29,690 --> 00:46:34,690
it feels like for me to be able to 
understand the difference between the 

616
00:46:34,690 --> 00:46:38,501
two and three,
I would need to have had a a childhood 

617
00:46:40,370 --> 00:46:45,370
of 10 to 15 years playing with kids,
going to school,

618
00:46:47,840 --> 00:46:52,840
being yelled at by parents,
all of that walking,

619
00:46:53,150 --> 00:46:58,150
jumping,
looking at ducks and now then I will be 

620
00:46:58,150 --> 00:47:02,771
able to generate the right predicate for
tying the difference between two and a 

621
00:47:02,771 --> 00:47:06,940
three.
Or do you think there's a more 

622
00:47:06,940 --> 00:47:06,940
efficient.

623
00:47:06,940 --> 00:47:08,570
Oh no,
for sure.

624
00:47:09,710 --> 00:47:13,390
You must know some signals of digits yes
to.

625
00:47:13,500 --> 00:47:18,500
And that's a powerful state,
but maybe there are serval languages of 

626
00:47:19,611 --> 00:47:21,550
description,
um,

627
00:47:22,510 --> 00:47:27,510
elements of digits.
So you talking about symmetry 

628
00:47:28,650 --> 00:47:29,800
properties,
Jordan,

629
00:47:30,320 --> 00:47:33,850
talking about some gaps there.
I don't know that,

630
00:47:34,570 --> 00:47:39,570
but this is a problem of intelligence.
So in one article it is revealed to show

631
00:47:42,990 --> 00:47:47,990
that every example can cut it not more 
than one beautiful information in the 

632
00:47:49,151 --> 00:47:52,310
hill because,
uh,

633
00:47:52,600 --> 00:47:57,600
with your show example,
and you say this is one you can remove a

634
00:48:00,240 --> 00:48:05,240
function which does not tell your mom 
the best strategy if you can do it,

635
00:48:06,530 --> 00:48:11,530
the city move off of options.
But when you used one predicate which 

636
00:48:13,091 --> 00:48:18,091
looks like a duck,
you can remove much more functions in 

637
00:48:18,091 --> 00:48:19,450
the cuff.
And that to me,

638
00:48:19,470 --> 00:48:24,470
that did contain a lot of information 
from formal point of view.

639
00:48:25,930 --> 00:48:30,930
But when you have a little picture what 
you want to send general picture.

640
00:48:34,830 --> 00:48:39,830
So what can you just put indicate?
And that predicates carter a lot of 

641
00:48:44,800 --> 00:48:45,020
noise,

642
00:48:47,200 --> 00:48:52,200
beautifully put maybe just me,
but in all the math you show in your 

643
00:48:52,931 --> 00:48:54,310
work,
uh,

644
00:48:54,580 --> 00:48:57,250
which is some of the most profound 
mathematical work in,

645
00:48:57,251 --> 00:48:59,350
in,
in the field of learning ai.

646
00:48:59,351 --> 00:49:04,280
And just math in general,
I hear a lot of poetry and philosophy.

647
00:49:04,290 --> 00:49:06,890
You really kind of,
um,

648
00:49:07,300 --> 00:49:09,400
talk about philosophy of science.
there's a,

649
00:49:09,710 --> 00:49:13,090
there's a poetry and music to a lot of 
the work you're doing and the way you're

650
00:49:13,091 --> 00:49:14,770
thinking about it.
So do you.

651
00:49:15,540 --> 00:49:18,850
Where does that come from?
Do you to escape to poetry?

652
00:49:18,851 --> 00:49:22,870
Do you escape to music?
Doesn't exist.

653
00:49:22,930 --> 00:49:27,930
Ground truth,
ground truth is that get seen 

654
00:49:28,750 --> 00:49:29,940
everywhere.
Yeah.

655
00:49:30,670 --> 00:49:32,130
The smart guy,
she lost them.

656
00:49:32,140 --> 00:49:37,140
Sometimes I surprise of the deep sea.
Sometimes some of them are completely 

657
00:49:42,740 --> 00:49:47,740
out of subject,
but the sheet music,

658
00:49:50,650 --> 00:49:55,650
music is the ground truth be important 
to you when you point z,

659
00:49:56,410 --> 00:50:01,410
z believes if they take dictation.
So what a piece of music as a piece of 

660
00:50:07,330 --> 00:50:10,930
empirical evidence gave you a sense that
they are,

661
00:50:10,931 --> 00:50:15,931
um,
they're touching something in the 

662
00:50:15,931 --> 00:50:17,290
ground.
Truth it to Structure the structure.

663
00:50:18,400 --> 00:50:22,010
Listening to bach structure.
Yeah,

664
00:50:22,180 --> 00:50:24,100
very,
very classic.

665
00:50:24,101 --> 00:50:26,190
Very simple.
It was the same with,

666
00:50:26,540 --> 00:50:31,540
when you enjoying the,
you can just say the same.

667
00:50:35,940 --> 00:50:37,120
Yeah.
Um,

668
00:50:38,200 --> 00:50:42,270
and if you look back at your childhood,
you grew up in Russia,

669
00:50:42,780 --> 00:50:46,140
you maybe were born as a researcher in 
Russia,

670
00:50:46,230 --> 00:50:47,940
you've developed as a researcher in 
Russia,

671
00:50:47,941 --> 00:50:51,090
he came to United States in a few 
places.

672
00:50:51,780 --> 00:50:53,940
If you look back,
what were,

673
00:50:54,000 --> 00:50:58,410
what was some of your happiest moments 
as a researcher?

674
00:50:59,520 --> 00:51:04,520
Some of the most profound moments,
not in terms of their impact on society,

675
00:51:06,240 --> 00:51:11,240
but in terms of their impact on how damn
good you feel that day and you remember 

676
00:51:13,351 --> 00:51:13,950
that moment,

677
00:51:15,350 --> 00:51:19,340
you know,
every time when you followed something.

678
00:51:21,060 --> 00:51:25,990
It is great and everybody,
simple things,

679
00:51:26,330 --> 00:51:28,890
just like your little feelings that they
mostly,

680
00:51:28,920 --> 00:51:33,920
most of my time was broke.
You should go again and again and again 

681
00:51:35,250 --> 00:51:40,250
and try to be honest with yourself,
look more contemporary,

682
00:51:41,790 --> 00:51:45,260
but try to understand that the new way 
to grant,

683
00:51:46,220 --> 00:51:49,330
not marty,
blah,

684
00:51:49,380 --> 00:51:50,070
blah,
blah,

685
00:51:51,210 --> 00:51:51,480
that.

686
00:51:52,540 --> 00:51:54,460
But you're allowed to get excited at 
the,

687
00:51:55,240 --> 00:51:59,410
at the possibility of discovery here.
You'll have to double check it.

688
00:51:59,470 --> 00:52:00,190
But uh,

689
00:52:01,130 --> 00:52:04,070
no,
but covered related to throws.

690
00:52:04,520 --> 00:52:09,520
Is it just for hair?
But you know,

691
00:52:11,300 --> 00:52:16,300
you always have a feeling your phone,
something of that.

692
00:52:19,670 --> 00:52:23,320
So 20 years ago with the discovery of 
statistical loading,

693
00:52:23,360 --> 00:52:28,360
so nobody believe except for one guy dr 
jay and live in 20 years then became 

694
00:52:35,160 --> 00:52:38,840
fashion is the same,
the support vector machines,

695
00:52:40,460 --> 00:52:41,150
machines.

696
00:52:41,370 --> 00:52:46,370
So what was supportive and machines are 
learning theory with when you were 

697
00:52:46,651 --> 00:52:51,651
working on it,
you had a sense that you had a sense of 

698
00:52:53,370 --> 00:52:57,510
the profundity of it,
the how that this,

699
00:52:57,550 --> 00:53:00,510
this seems to be right.
It seems to be powerful,

700
00:53:00,610 --> 00:53:02,340
right?
Absolutely.

701
00:53:02,870 --> 00:53:07,870
Definitely lost waiver and know when 
fallen zoos.

702
00:53:14,230 --> 00:53:19,000
In what story you feel the same 
feelings.

703
00:53:19,070 --> 00:53:22,510
Look at this company because I have 
perused.

704
00:53:22,970 --> 00:53:27,970
No different mechanisms.
You can some say cosmetic improvement 

705
00:53:28,560 --> 00:53:33,560
you can do,
but in terms of your audience,

706
00:53:35,450 --> 00:53:40,450
the more statistical learning they 
should work together,

707
00:53:41,520 --> 00:53:46,520
but also I'm credited as a fordable 
lights.

708
00:53:47,730 --> 00:53:52,730
What is intelligence that and to 
separate from technical bottom.

709
00:53:55,140 --> 00:53:56,370
Exactly.
it's completely different.

710
00:53:57,230 --> 00:54:02,230
Absolutely.
well thank you so much for talking 

711
00:54:02,230 --> 00:54:02,230
today.
Thank you.

712
00:54:02,230 --> 00:54:02,230
It's an honor.
