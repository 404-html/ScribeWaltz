1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:04,530
The following is a conversation with
Eric Weinstein. He's a mathematician,

2
00:00:04,590 --> 00:00:08,130
economist, physicist, and the
managing director of Teal capital.

3
00:00:08,700 --> 00:00:13,620
He coined the term and you can say is
the founder of the intellectual dark web,

4
00:00:14,340 --> 00:00:17,190
which is a loosely assembled
group of public intellectuals.

5
00:00:17,280 --> 00:00:21,750
That includes Sam Harris, Jordan and
Pearson, Steven Pinker, Joe Rogan,

6
00:00:22,200 --> 00:00:24,180
Michael Shermer,
and a few others.

7
00:00:24,840 --> 00:00:29,220
This conversation is part of
the artificial intelligence
podcasts at MIT and

8
00:00:29,280 --> 00:00:33,520
beyond. If you enjoy it,
subscribe on Youtube, iTunes,

9
00:00:33,670 --> 00:00:37,920
or simply connect with me on Twitter
at [inaudible] Friedman, spelled f,

10
00:00:37,921 --> 00:00:38,820
r I.
D.

11
00:00:39,370 --> 00:00:43,250
And now here's my conversation
with Eric Weinstein.

12
00:00:44,590 --> 00:00:48,670
Are you nervous about this? Scared
shitless. Okay. The busboy, Chris. Yeah.

13
00:00:50,530 --> 00:00:53,020
You mentioned Kung Fu panda is
one of your favorite movies.

14
00:00:54,520 --> 00:00:57,670
It has the usual profile master
student dynamic going on.

15
00:00:57,970 --> 00:00:59,740
So who was,

16
00:00:59,830 --> 00:01:03,340
who has been a teacher that's significant
influence the direction of your

17
00:01:03,670 --> 00:01:08,210
thinking in life's work? So if you're
the Kung Fu panda, who was your she fu?

18
00:01:08,650 --> 00:01:08,801
Oh,

19
00:01:08,801 --> 00:01:12,580
well it's interesting because I didn't
see she as being the teacher who was the

20
00:01:12,581 --> 00:01:17,440
teacher. Oui. Master. Obey
the turtle. All the turtle,

21
00:01:17,470 --> 00:01:19,550
right?
They only meet twice and the

22
00:01:19,660 --> 00:01:23,800
tire film and the first
conversation sort of doesn't count.

23
00:01:25,080 --> 00:01:29,240
So the magic of the film,
in fact, it's point yeah.

24
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:35,320
Is that the teaching that really
matters is transferred during a single

25
00:01:36,081 --> 00:01:39,340
conversation. Right. And it's very brief.

26
00:01:40,030 --> 00:01:44,890
And so who played that role in
my life, I would say, uh, either,

27
00:01:45,490 --> 00:01:48,300
uh, my grandfather, uh,

28
00:01:48,610 --> 00:01:51,040
Harry Reuben and his wife Sophie Reuben,

29
00:01:51,130 --> 00:01:56,090
my grandmother or Tom Lehrer top layer.
Yeah.

30
00:01:57,290 --> 00:02:00,680
In which way if you give a
child Tom Lehrer records,

31
00:02:01,370 --> 00:02:06,370
what you do is you destroy their ability
to be taken over by later malware.

32
00:02:08,020 --> 00:02:12,460
And it's so irreverent,
so witty, so clever,

33
00:02:12,580 --> 00:02:17,580
so obscene that it destroys the ability
to lead a normal life for many people.

34
00:02:19,301 --> 00:02:21,040
So if I meet somebody who usually

35
00:02:23,530 --> 00:02:28,120
really shifted from any kind
of neurotypical presentation,
I'll often ask them,

36
00:02:28,740 --> 00:02:30,580
uh,
are you a Tom Lehrer fan?

37
00:02:30,670 --> 00:02:34,240
And the odds that they will
respond or are quite high. Now,

38
00:02:34,241 --> 00:02:38,890
Tom Layer is a poisoning pigeons in the
park Tom Layer. That's very interesting.

39
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:43,000
There are a small number of Tom Lehrer
songs that broke into the general

40
00:02:43,001 --> 00:02:45,160
population poisoning pigeons in the park.

41
00:02:45,190 --> 00:02:49,000
The element song and
perhaps the Vatican reg. Uh,

42
00:02:49,030 --> 00:02:52,870
so when you meet somebody who knows
those songs but doesn't know how you're

43
00:02:52,871 --> 00:02:57,010
judging me right now, aren't you
harshly? Uh, no, but you're Russian.

44
00:02:57,011 --> 00:03:01,290
So I got as a you known Nico
Evanovich a Chesky. That's us. Yeah.

45
00:03:01,820 --> 00:03:05,470
So that was a song about plagiarism
that was in fact plagiarized,

46
00:03:05,500 --> 00:03:09,420
which most people don't know
from Danny Kaye. Uh, we're,

47
00:03:09,430 --> 00:03:12,490
Danny Kaye did a song called
Stanislavski of the Musky Arts.

48
00:03:12,910 --> 00:03:17,910
And so Tom Lehrer did this brilliant job
of plagiarizing a song about and making

49
00:03:18,881 --> 00:03:22,960
it about plagiarism and then making it
about this mathematician who worked in

50
00:03:22,961 --> 00:03:27,490
non EUCLIDEAN geometry.
That was like a giving heroin to a child.

51
00:03:27,520 --> 00:03:32,520
It was extremely addictive and eventually
led me to a lot of different places,

52
00:03:33,521 --> 00:03:35,410
one of which may have
been a phd in mathematics.

53
00:03:36,490 --> 00:03:40,600
And he was also at least the lecture
in mathematics, I believe at Harvard.

54
00:03:40,601 --> 00:03:43,960
Something like that. Yeah, I just
had dinner with him. In fact,

55
00:03:45,130 --> 00:03:49,350
when my son turned 13, we
didn't tell him, but, um,

56
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:53,380
his bar Mitzvah present
was dinner with his hero,

57
00:03:53,381 --> 00:03:58,210
Tom Lehrer and a toddler was 88 years old,
sharp as a tack,

58
00:03:58,780 --> 00:04:03,280
irreverent and funny as
hell. And just, you know,

59
00:04:03,290 --> 00:04:06,050
there are very few people in this world
that you have to meet while they're

60
00:04:06,051 --> 00:04:08,660
still here. And that was
definitely one for our family.

61
00:04:09,260 --> 00:04:12,410
So that wit is a reflection

62
00:04:13,670 --> 00:04:15,710
of intelligence in some kind of deep way.

63
00:04:15,740 --> 00:04:18,530
Like where that would be a
good test of intelligence,

64
00:04:18,531 --> 00:04:21,410
whether you're a Lehrer fan.
So what do you think that is about?

65
00:04:21,411 --> 00:04:25,310
What about that kind of humor,

66
00:04:26,210 --> 00:04:28,700
ability to see the absurdity in existence?

67
00:04:28,760 --> 00:04:32,780
What do you think that's connected to
intelligence or we just to Jews on a mic

68
00:04:32,950 --> 00:04:35,000
that appreciate that kind of humor?
No,

69
00:04:35,190 --> 00:04:37,960
I think that it's absolutely
connected to intelligence. So you can,

70
00:04:37,970 --> 00:04:38,803
you can see it.

71
00:04:40,030 --> 00:04:44,170
There's a place where Tom Lehrer
decides that he's going to lampoon, uh,

72
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:47,830
Gilbert of Gilbert and Sullivan and
he's going to outdo Gilbert with clever,

73
00:04:47,831 --> 00:04:52,660
meaningless wordplay. And he
has, I forget the honesty. He,

74
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:57,040
he's doing clementine as if Gilbert and
Sullivan wrote it and he says that I

75
00:04:57,041 --> 00:04:59,470
missed her depressed. Her young
sister named Mr this, Mr Pessler,

76
00:04:59,471 --> 00:05:01,660
she tried pestering sisters,
a festering blister.

77
00:05:01,661 --> 00:05:05,440
You best to resist or say I the sister
persisted. The Mr existed. I kissed her,

78
00:05:05,441 --> 00:05:07,420
all loyalty slipped when he said,
when she said, I could have her,

79
00:05:07,421 --> 00:05:11,800
her sister's cadaver must surely have
turned in a script that's so dense.

80
00:05:11,830 --> 00:05:16,810
It's so insane that that's
clearly intelligence,

81
00:05:16,830 --> 00:05:18,970
uh, because it's hard to
construct something like that.

82
00:05:19,480 --> 00:05:22,870
If I look at my favorite Tom Lear,
Tom Lehrer lyric,

83
00:05:24,060 --> 00:05:26,520
you know,
there's a perfectly absurd one,

84
00:05:26,521 --> 00:05:28,740
which is once all the Germans
were warlike and mean,

85
00:05:28,741 --> 00:05:30,150
but that couldn't happen again.

86
00:05:30,180 --> 00:05:34,380
We taught them a lesson
in 1918 and they've hardly
bothered us since then. Right?

87
00:05:34,440 --> 00:05:36,990
That is a different kind of intelligence.
You know,

88
00:05:36,991 --> 00:05:40,850
you're taking something that
is so horrific and you're,

89
00:05:40,910 --> 00:05:45,810
you're sort of making it palatable
and funny and demonstrating also,

90
00:05:45,900 --> 00:05:50,220
um, just your humanity. I mean, I
think the thing that came through as,

91
00:05:51,060 --> 00:05:53,370
as Tom Lehrer wrote all of these terrible,

92
00:05:53,371 --> 00:05:58,371
horrible lines was just what a sensitive
and beautiful soul he was who was

93
00:05:58,551 --> 00:06:01,640
channeling pain through
humor and through grace

94
00:06:02,790 --> 00:06:04,050
I've seen throughout Europe,

95
00:06:04,051 --> 00:06:08,340
throughout Russia that same kind of
humor emerge from the generation of World

96
00:06:08,341 --> 00:06:09,174
War Two.

97
00:06:09,180 --> 00:06:12,780
It seemed like that humor is required
to somehow deal with the pain and the

98
00:06:12,781 --> 00:06:16,160
suffering of that that war created.
Well,

99
00:06:16,520 --> 00:06:19,670
you do need the environment to
create the broad Slavic soul.

100
00:06:19,700 --> 00:06:24,380
I don't think that many
Americans really appreciate,

101
00:06:24,530 --> 00:06:26,870
um,
Russian humor.

102
00:06:28,210 --> 00:06:33,210
How you had to joke during the time
of let's say article 58 under Stalin,

103
00:06:33,820 --> 00:06:35,980
you had to be very, very
careful. You know, the,

104
00:06:35,981 --> 00:06:40,981
the concept of a Russian
satirical magazine like
crocodile a doesn't make sense.

105
00:06:41,320 --> 00:06:46,320
So you have this cross cultural problem
that there are certain areas of human

106
00:06:47,961 --> 00:06:50,720
experience that it would be
better to know nothing about.

107
00:06:51,170 --> 00:06:55,640
And quite unfortunately, eastern
Europe knows a great deal about them,

108
00:06:55,641 --> 00:06:57,050
which makes the,
you know,

109
00:06:57,140 --> 00:07:01,610
the songs of letting me or Wysocki's
so potent the, uh, you know,

110
00:07:01,611 --> 00:07:04,070
the pros of Pushkin, whatever it is, uh,

111
00:07:04,200 --> 00:07:09,150
you have to appreciate the depth of
the Eastern European experience. And I,

112
00:07:09,151 --> 00:07:13,670
I would think that perhaps Americans knew
something like this around the time of

113
00:07:13,671 --> 00:07:17,750
the civil war or maybe, um, you know,

114
00:07:17,751 --> 00:07:21,560
under slavery and Jim Crow or even the,
uh,

115
00:07:21,950 --> 00:07:24,110
harsh tyranny of a,

116
00:07:24,140 --> 00:07:29,000
the coal and steel employers
during the Labor wars. Um,

117
00:07:29,090 --> 00:07:30,290
but in general,

118
00:07:30,320 --> 00:07:35,320
I would say it's hard for us to understand
and imagine the collective culture

119
00:07:36,020 --> 00:07:40,280
unless we have the system of
selective pressures. For example, uh,

120
00:07:40,310 --> 00:07:41,290
Russians were subjected to,

121
00:07:42,330 --> 00:07:46,520
yeah. So if there is one good
thing and that comes out of a war,

122
00:07:46,700 --> 00:07:51,410
it's literature,
art and a humor and music.

123
00:07:51,710 --> 00:07:52,371
Oh,
I don't think so.

124
00:07:52,371 --> 00:07:56,720
I think almost everything is good about
war except for death and destruction,

125
00:07:56,990 --> 00:08:00,730
right? Eh, without the
death they would bring, uh,

126
00:08:00,980 --> 00:08:04,340
and the romance of it. The whole thing
is nice. This is why we're always

127
00:08:04,530 --> 00:08:08,310
caught up in war and we have this
very ambiguous relationship to it,

128
00:08:08,311 --> 00:08:12,060
is that it makes life real
and pressing and meaningful

129
00:08:12,730 --> 00:08:17,250
and at an unacceptable price.
And the price has never been higher.

130
00:08:17,730 --> 00:08:22,050
So jumping
into AI a little bit,

131
00:08:22,710 --> 00:08:23,543
you,
uh,

132
00:08:24,550 --> 00:08:28,770
in one of the conversation you had or
one of the videos you described that one

133
00:08:28,771 --> 00:08:32,070
of the things AI systems can't
do and biological systems,

134
00:08:32,071 --> 00:08:35,490
can his self replicate in the
physical world? No, no, no.

135
00:08:37,290 --> 00:08:40,290
In the physical world, well, yes,

136
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:43,310
the physical robots can't self replicate,
but if it,

137
00:08:43,400 --> 00:08:46,140
but this is a very tricky point,

138
00:08:46,860 --> 00:08:51,360
which is that the only thing that
we've been able to create that's really

139
00:08:51,361 --> 00:08:55,020
complex that has an analog
of our reproductive system

140
00:08:55,910 --> 00:08:58,280
is software.
But nevertheless,

141
00:08:58,730 --> 00:09:01,250
software rep replicates itself.

142
00:09:01,810 --> 00:09:05,780
If we're speaking strictly for the
replication in this kind of digital space.

143
00:09:06,030 --> 00:09:08,660
So let me just to begin,
let me ask a question.

144
00:09:08,661 --> 00:09:13,661
Do you see a protective barrier or a
gap between the physical world and the

145
00:09:14,391 --> 00:09:15,190
digital world?

146
00:09:15,190 --> 00:09:16,330
What's that?
Call it digital,

147
00:09:16,390 --> 00:09:19,540
let's call it the logical world
versus the physical world.

148
00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:24,480
Why logical? Well, because
even though we had, let's say,

149
00:09:24,481 --> 00:09:27,180
Einstein's brain preserved,
uh,

150
00:09:27,210 --> 00:09:31,920
it was meaningless to us as a physical
object because we couldn't do anything

151
00:09:31,921 --> 00:09:34,740
with what was stored in
it at a logical level.

152
00:09:35,520 --> 00:09:39,300
And so the idea that something may be
stored logically and that it may be stored

153
00:09:39,301 --> 00:09:43,470
physically, uh, are not necessarily a,

154
00:09:43,471 --> 00:09:45,730
we don't always benefit
from synonymous there.

155
00:09:45,731 --> 00:09:49,200
I'm not suggesting that there isn't a
material basis to the logical world,

156
00:09:49,800 --> 00:09:54,800
but that it does warrant a identification
with the separate layer that need not

157
00:09:56,160 --> 00:09:58,830
invoke logic gates and Zeros and ones.

158
00:09:59,400 --> 00:09:59,971
And,
uh,

159
00:09:59,971 --> 00:10:03,450
so connecting those two worlds of the
logical world and the physical world or

160
00:10:03,451 --> 00:10:07,920
maybe just connecting to the
logical world inside of our brain.

161
00:10:07,990 --> 00:10:11,880
[inaudible] brain.
You mentioned the idea of out

162
00:10:13,460 --> 00:10:16,830
intelligence, artificial intelligence,
artificial intelligence. Yes.

163
00:10:16,890 --> 00:10:21,890
This is the only essay that John
Brockman ever invited me to write that he

164
00:10:22,111 --> 00:10:23,760
refused to publish an edge.

165
00:10:25,510 --> 00:10:30,400
Why? Well, maybe it wasn't, it wasn't
well written. Um, but I don't know.

166
00:10:31,050 --> 00:10:34,150
The idea is quite compelling is
quite unique and new and for,

167
00:10:34,170 --> 00:10:38,590
at least from my view of Stan's
point, maybe you can explain it. Sure.

168
00:10:39,460 --> 00:10:44,460
What I was thinking about is why it is
that we're waiting to be terrified by

169
00:10:44,911 --> 00:10:49,350
artificial general intelligence,
when in fact, artificial life,

170
00:10:50,130 --> 00:10:54,430
uh, is terrifying in and of
itself. And it's already here.

171
00:10:54,490 --> 00:10:57,160
So in order to have a system
of selective pressures,

172
00:10:57,760 --> 00:10:59,680
you need three distinct elements.

173
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:03,860
You need variation within a population.

174
00:11:04,280 --> 00:11:08,340
You need heritability and you
need differential success. Okay.

175
00:11:08,460 --> 00:11:12,870
So what's really unique, and I've
made this point, I think elsewhere

176
00:11:14,450 --> 00:11:18,630
about it, software, is that if you think
about what humans know how to build,

177
00:11:18,631 --> 00:11:21,480
that's impressive.
So I always take a car and I say,

178
00:11:21,481 --> 00:11:25,470
does it have an analog of each of
the physical physiological systems?

179
00:11:25,471 --> 00:11:27,480
Does it have a skeletal structure?
That's its frame.

180
00:11:27,810 --> 00:11:31,560
Does it have a n a neurological structure?
It has an onboard computer,

181
00:11:32,040 --> 00:11:33,570
has a digestive system.

182
00:11:35,630 --> 00:11:40,460
The one thing it doesn't have
as a reproductive system,
but if you can call spawn

183
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,970
on a process, effectively, you
do have a reproductive system.

184
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:50,530
And that means that you can
create something with variation,

185
00:11:50,531 --> 00:11:52,780
heritability,
and differential success.

186
00:11:53,320 --> 00:11:56,110
Now the next step in the
chain of thinking was,

187
00:11:56,470 --> 00:12:01,470
where do we see inanimate
non-intelligent life?

188
00:12:02,050 --> 00:12:06,850
Outwitting intelligent life.
And um,

189
00:12:06,910 --> 00:12:10,210
I have two favorite systems and I try
to stay on them so that we don't get

190
00:12:10,211 --> 00:12:14,160
distracted. One of which is
the Oh, freeze orchid, um,

191
00:12:14,950 --> 00:12:19,300
subspecies or sub clade, I don't know
what to call it as a type of flower. Yeah.

192
00:12:19,301 --> 00:12:24,010
It's a type of flower that mimics the
female of a pollinator species in order to

193
00:12:24,011 --> 00:12:27,400
dupe the males into, uh, engaging.

194
00:12:27,401 --> 00:12:30,580
It was called pseudo copulation
with the fake female,

195
00:12:30,581 --> 00:12:32,950
which is usually represented
by the lowest pedal.

196
00:12:33,670 --> 00:12:36,940
And there's also a fair amount component
to fool the males and to thinking they

197
00:12:36,941 --> 00:12:40,210
have a mating opportunity, but the
flower doesn't have to give up energy,

198
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:43,900
energy in the form of nectar as a
lower because it's tricking the males.

199
00:12:45,220 --> 00:12:48,830
The other system is a particular species,
uh,

200
00:12:49,660 --> 00:12:54,370
of muscle lamp bacillus in
the clear streams of Missouri.

201
00:12:54,910 --> 00:12:59,910
And it fools bass into biting a
fleshy lip that contain its young.

202
00:13:01,660 --> 00:13:04,750
And when the bass see this fleshy lip,

203
00:13:04,751 --> 00:13:09,430
which it looks exactly like a species of
fish that the best like to eat the, uh,

204
00:13:09,431 --> 00:13:14,080
the young explode and clamp onto
the gills and parasitize the bass.

205
00:13:14,110 --> 00:13:19,110
And also lose the best to redistribute
them as they eventually release both of

206
00:13:19,781 --> 00:13:24,100
these systems.
You have a highly intelligent

207
00:13:25,750 --> 00:13:28,960
duped being fooled by a lower life form.

208
00:13:30,310 --> 00:13:33,640
And what is sculpting these,
these convincing Lewers,

209
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:39,480
it's the intelligence of previously
duped targets for these strategies.

210
00:13:41,380 --> 00:13:45,580
So when the target is smart
enough to avoid the strategy, uh,

211
00:13:45,610 --> 00:13:49,390
those weaker mimics a fall off.

212
00:13:49,480 --> 00:13:52,690
They have terminal lines and
only the better ones survive.

213
00:13:52,691 --> 00:13:56,490
So it's an arms race between
the target species, uh,

214
00:13:56,530 --> 00:13:58,090
that is being parasitized

215
00:13:59,830 --> 00:14:04,830
getting smarter and this other less
intelligent or not intelligent object

216
00:14:06,250 --> 00:14:10,380
getting as if smarter.
And so what you see is,

217
00:14:10,381 --> 00:14:12,460
is that artificial intelligence,

218
00:14:12,490 --> 00:14:16,600
artificial general intelligence
is not needed to parasitize us.

219
00:14:17,050 --> 00:14:21,550
It's simply sufficient for
us to outwit ourselves.

220
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:26,800
So you could have a, a program, let's say,
you know, one of these Nigerian scams, um,

221
00:14:26,830 --> 00:14:31,830
that writes letters and uses
whoever sends it Bitcoin,

222
00:14:32,760 --> 00:14:36,760
uh, to figure out which aspects
of the program should be kept,

223
00:14:36,761 --> 00:14:38,410
which should be varied and thrown away.

224
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:42,340
And you don't need it to be in any way
intelligent in order to have a really

225
00:14:42,341 --> 00:14:45,850
nightmare scenario of being parasitized
by something that has no idea what it's

226
00:14:45,851 --> 00:14:49,270
doing. So you, you, you phrase it,
if you guys have really eloquently,

227
00:14:49,271 --> 00:14:51,980
so let me try it to uh,
as a few

228
00:14:51,980 --> 00:14:56,420
directions. This goes. So one, four s
first on the way we write software today,

229
00:14:56,840 --> 00:15:01,840
it's not common that we allow it to self
modify what we do have that ability.

230
00:15:02,121 --> 00:15:06,350
Now we have the ability, it's just
not common, isn't as common. So,

231
00:15:06,710 --> 00:15:07,543
so your,

232
00:15:07,580 --> 00:15:12,580
your thought is that that is a serious
worry if there becomes a modifying code

233
00:15:16,251 --> 00:15:21,020
is, is available now. So there's different
types of self modification, right?

234
00:15:21,021 --> 00:15:24,950
There's a personalization.
You know, your email app,

235
00:15:24,951 --> 00:15:29,951
your Gmail is a self modifying to
you after you log in or whatever.

236
00:15:31,371 --> 00:15:34,060
You can think of it that way.
But ultimately it's central.

237
00:15:34,070 --> 00:15:36,920
All the information is centralized,

238
00:15:37,760 --> 00:15:40,670
but you're thinking of ideas
where you're completely,

239
00:15:40,671 --> 00:15:43,310
so this isn't a unique entity,
uh,

240
00:15:43,370 --> 00:15:47,540
operating under selective pressures
and it changes. Well, you just,

241
00:15:47,541 --> 00:15:52,541
if you think about the fact that our
immune systems don't know what's coming at

242
00:15:53,061 --> 00:15:57,560
them next, but they have a small
set of spanning components,

243
00:15:57,860 --> 00:15:58,460
and if it's,

244
00:15:58,460 --> 00:16:03,260
if it's a sufficiently expressive
system in that any shape,

245
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:08,150
uh, or binding region can
be approximated, uh, with,

246
00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:10,770
with the Lego that is present.
Um,

247
00:16:11,180 --> 00:16:15,800
then you can have confidence that you
don't need to know what's coming at you

248
00:16:15,801 --> 00:16:17,420
because the common,
a torics

249
00:16:19,010 --> 00:16:22,950
are sufficient to reach any
configuration needed. Uh,

250
00:16:23,270 --> 00:16:25,820
so that's a beautiful thing.
Well,

251
00:16:25,850 --> 00:16:28,460
terrifying thing to worry about
because it's so within our reach,

252
00:16:30,290 --> 00:16:31,820
whatever I suggest these things,

253
00:16:31,821 --> 00:16:35,390
I do always have a concern as to whether
or not I will bring them into being by

254
00:16:35,391 --> 00:16:40,000
talking about them. So, uh, there's
this thing from open AI, so,

255
00:16:40,550 --> 00:16:44,900
uh, next next week. So talk
to fonder of Openai, uh,

256
00:16:45,620 --> 00:16:49,020
this idea that a, their text
generation, the new, uh,

257
00:16:49,070 --> 00:16:53,150
the new stuff they have for generating
texts is they didn't want to bring it,

258
00:16:53,480 --> 00:16:57,940
they didn't want to release it
because they're worried about the god.

259
00:16:57,950 --> 00:17:00,860
Delighted to hear that, but they're
going to end up releasing. Yes.

260
00:17:00,861 --> 00:17:05,210
So that's the thing is I think talking
about it. Um, well at least from my end,

261
00:17:05,211 --> 00:17:10,190
I'm more a proponent of
Technology preventing techno,

262
00:17:10,230 --> 00:17:12,560
uh,
so further innovation,

263
00:17:12,740 --> 00:17:17,090
preventing the detrimental effects
of innovation. What were the,

264
00:17:17,690 --> 00:17:21,620
were sort of tumbling down a
hill at accelerating speed.

265
00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:26,480
So whether or not we're proponents or it
doesn't really mean it may not matter,

266
00:17:26,870 --> 00:17:31,580
but I do not. Well, I do feel that there
are people who've held things back and,

267
00:17:31,581 --> 00:17:35,300
uh, you know, died poor than
they might have otherwise been.

268
00:17:35,301 --> 00:17:36,680
We don't even know their names.

269
00:17:37,400 --> 00:17:42,260
I don't think that we should discount
the idea that having the smartest people

270
00:17:43,370 --> 00:17:48,050
showing off how smart they are by what
they've developed. Maybe a terminal

271
00:17:50,120 --> 00:17:53,390
process. I'm, I'm very
mindful in particular,

272
00:17:53,930 --> 00:17:58,250
have a beautiful letter that Edward
Teller of all people wrote to Leo Szilard

273
00:17:58,300 --> 00:18:02,120
and whereas Szilard was trying to
figure how to control the use of atomic

274
00:18:02,121 --> 00:18:07,121
weaponry at the end of World War II and
teller rather strangely because many of

275
00:18:07,581 --> 00:18:09,890
us view him as a monster,
um,

276
00:18:09,891 --> 00:18:12,800
showed some very advanced moral thinking,

277
00:18:13,130 --> 00:18:16,370
talking about the slim
chance we have for survival.

278
00:18:16,371 --> 00:18:19,010
And that the only hope is
to make Warren thinkable.

279
00:18:19,460 --> 00:18:24,460
I do think that not enough of us feel in
our gut what it is we are playing with.

280
00:18:24,680 --> 00:18:26,540
When we were working
on technical problems,

281
00:18:27,170 --> 00:18:29,120
and I would recommend to
anyone who hasn't seen it,

282
00:18:29,210 --> 00:18:34,210
a movie called the bridge over the
bridge on the river Kwai about I believe

283
00:18:34,490 --> 00:18:39,490
captured British POW [inaudible] who just
in a desire to do a bridge well end up

284
00:18:40,251 --> 00:18:42,280
over collaborating with
their Japanese cap.

285
00:18:43,040 --> 00:18:46,610
Well now you're making me a question.

286
00:18:46,611 --> 00:18:50,060
The under strict it open
discussion of ideas and AI.

287
00:18:51,160 --> 00:18:52,540
I'm not saying I know the answer,

288
00:18:52,541 --> 00:18:57,180
I'm just saying that I could make a
decent case for either our need to talk

289
00:18:57,181 --> 00:19:01,500
about this and to become technologically
focused on containing it or need to

290
00:19:01,501 --> 00:19:06,501
stop talking about this and try to hope
that the relatively small number of

291
00:19:07,051 --> 00:19:11,100
highly adept individuals who are looking
at these problems is small enough that

292
00:19:11,101 --> 00:19:13,560
we should in fact be talking
about how to contain them.

293
00:19:13,910 --> 00:19:15,260
Well,
the way ideas,

294
00:19:15,320 --> 00:19:19,580
the way innovation happens when new
ideas develop a Newton with calculus,

295
00:19:20,270 --> 00:19:24,500
whether if, ah, he was
silent, the idea would be,

296
00:19:24,530 --> 00:19:29,180
would emerge elsewhere in case Casey
Newton of course. But, uh, you know,

297
00:19:29,181 --> 00:19:30,470
it went in case of AI,

298
00:19:30,620 --> 00:19:35,570
how small is the set of individuals
out of which such ideas would arise

299
00:19:36,870 --> 00:19:38,090
is it isn't one of the,

300
00:19:38,091 --> 00:19:42,100
the ideas that the researchers we know
and those that we don't know who may live

301
00:19:42,101 --> 00:19:46,510
in countries that don't wish us to know
what level they're currently at and very

302
00:19:46,511 --> 00:19:50,830
disciplined and keeping these, uh,
things to themselves. Of course,

303
00:19:50,831 --> 00:19:55,831
I will point out that there is a
religious school in Kerala that developed

304
00:19:57,170 --> 00:20:01,520
something very close to the calculus,
certainly in terms of infinite series in,

305
00:20:01,521 --> 00:20:02,354
um,

306
00:20:04,190 --> 00:20:08,750
I guess religious prayer, uh, and, and uh,

307
00:20:08,780 --> 00:20:11,670
and Ryman pros. So, you know,

308
00:20:11,690 --> 00:20:16,100
it's not that Newton had any ability
to hold that back and I don't really

309
00:20:16,101 --> 00:20:17,630
believe that we have an
ability to hold it back.

310
00:20:17,631 --> 00:20:22,010
I do think that we could change the
proportion of the time we spend worrying

311
00:20:22,011 --> 00:20:25,310
about the effects of what if we are
successful rather than simply trying to

312
00:20:25,311 --> 00:20:27,440
succeed and hope that we'll be
able to contain things later.

313
00:20:28,220 --> 00:20:31,310
Beautifully put.
So on the idea of intelligence,

314
00:20:31,340 --> 00:20:36,340
what form trading cautiously is we've
agreed as we tumbled down the hill,

315
00:20:37,480 --> 00:20:42,310
uh, what happens is the upper cells, can
we, we can, we cannot, uh, well formed.

316
00:20:42,311 --> 00:20:46,490
Do you, do you see it taking?
So one example, Facebook,

317
00:20:46,720 --> 00:20:51,280
Google of it. We'll do one too.
I don't know a better word.

318
00:20:51,520 --> 00:20:55,120
You want to influence users
to behave a certain way.

319
00:20:55,740 --> 00:21:00,740
And so that's one kind of example of
our intelligence is a systems perhaps

320
00:21:01,211 --> 00:21:04,420
modifying the behavior of their,
the,

321
00:21:04,421 --> 00:21:08,290
these intelligent human beings in order
to sell more product of different kinds.

322
00:21:08,590 --> 00:21:13,480
But do you see other examples of this
actually emerging in just take any

323
00:21:13,481 --> 00:21:15,710
parasitic system?
You know,

324
00:21:16,090 --> 00:21:20,020
make sure that there's some way in
which that there's differential success

325
00:21:20,470 --> 00:21:21,303
heritability

326
00:21:23,580 --> 00:21:27,400
and in variation and those
are the magic ingredients.

327
00:21:27,401 --> 00:21:29,260
And if you really wanted to
build a nightmare machine,

328
00:21:29,261 --> 00:21:33,940
makes sure that the system that
expresses the variability, uh,

329
00:21:33,970 --> 00:21:38,830
has a spanning set so that it
can learn to arbitrary levels,

330
00:21:38,890 --> 00:21:42,430
uh, by making it sufficiently
expressive. That's your nightmare.

331
00:21:43,090 --> 00:21:46,450
So it's your nightmare.
But it could also be as,

332
00:21:46,451 --> 00:21:51,451
it's a really powerful mechanism by
which to create well powerful systems.

333
00:21:52,210 --> 00:21:57,210
So are you more worried about the negative
direction that might go versus the

334
00:21:58,271 --> 00:22:00,400
positive?
So you say parasitic,

335
00:22:00,430 --> 00:22:04,330
but that doesn't necessarily need to
be what the system converges towards.

336
00:22:05,050 --> 00:22:07,840
It could be a, what is
it? They are a citizen.

337
00:22:08,390 --> 00:22:11,600
The dividing line between
parasitism and symbiosis

338
00:22:12,190 --> 00:22:15,760
is not so clear. That's what they tell
me about marriage. I'm still single,

339
00:22:15,761 --> 00:22:19,570
so I know. Well, um, yeah, I,

340
00:22:20,800 --> 00:22:23,970
we can go into that too, but no,

341
00:22:23,980 --> 00:22:27,290
I think we have to
appreciate, you know, are,

342
00:22:27,350 --> 00:22:30,760
are you infected by your own Mitochondria?
Right,

343
00:22:35,140 --> 00:22:35,800
right.
Yeah.

344
00:22:35,800 --> 00:22:38,860
So, you know, in marriage you
fear the loss of independence.

345
00:22:38,861 --> 00:22:41,710
But even though the American,
uh,

346
00:22:41,740 --> 00:22:44,800
therapeutic community may be very
concerned about codependence,

347
00:22:45,280 --> 00:22:49,060
what's to say that codependence isn't
what's necessary to have a stable

348
00:22:49,810 --> 00:22:54,280
relationship in which to raise children
who are maximally case selected and

349
00:22:54,281 --> 00:22:57,580
require incredible amounts of care
because you have to wait 13 years before

350
00:22:57,581 --> 00:22:58,900
there's any reproductive payout.

351
00:22:58,901 --> 00:23:02,890
And most of us don't want our 13 year
olds having kids as a very tricky

352
00:23:02,891 --> 00:23:06,400
situation to analyze.
I would say that, um,

353
00:23:07,410 --> 00:23:12,330
predators and parasites drive much of
our evolution and I don't know whether to

354
00:23:12,331 --> 00:23:13,650
be angry at them or thank them.

355
00:23:13,880 --> 00:23:14,840
Well,
ultimately the,

356
00:23:15,230 --> 00:23:19,430
I mean nobody knows the meaning of
life or what even happinesses, but uh,

357
00:23:19,431 --> 00:23:23,800
there is some metrics, but did she
tell you they, they didn't. Uh,

358
00:23:24,230 --> 00:23:28,220
that's why all the poetry and
books are about the, you know,

359
00:23:28,221 --> 00:23:32,270
there is some metrics under which you
can kind of measure how good it is that

360
00:23:32,271 --> 00:23:36,290
these AI systems are roaming about.
So you're more,

361
00:23:36,560 --> 00:23:39,500
you're more nervous about software,

362
00:23:39,560 --> 00:23:44,560
then you are optimistic about
ideas of self replicating.

363
00:23:45,100 --> 00:23:46,490
I don't think we've really

364
00:23:46,490 --> 00:23:50,540
felt where we are.
You know,

365
00:23:50,541 --> 00:23:51,890
occasionally we get a wake up

366
00:23:53,540 --> 00:23:57,120
nine 11 was so anomalous
compared to everything we've up,

367
00:23:57,200 --> 00:24:02,200
everything else we've experienced on
American soil that it came to us as a

368
00:24:02,421 --> 00:24:04,940
complete shock that that
was even a possibility.

369
00:24:04,941 --> 00:24:09,941
What it really was was a highly creative
and determined r and d team deep in the

370
00:24:11,060 --> 00:24:14,030
bowels of Afghanistan.
Um,

371
00:24:14,210 --> 00:24:18,770
showing us that we had certain exploits
that were open to that nobody had chosen

372
00:24:18,771 --> 00:24:19,371
to express.

373
00:24:19,371 --> 00:24:23,330
I can think of several of these things
that I don't talk about publicly that

374
00:24:23,331 --> 00:24:25,700
just seem to have to do with,
um,

375
00:24:26,930 --> 00:24:31,930
how relatively unimaginative those who
wished to cause havoc and destruction had

376
00:24:32,301 --> 00:24:36,170
been up until now.
The great mystery of our time,

377
00:24:37,190 --> 00:24:37,731
of,

378
00:24:37,731 --> 00:24:42,731
of this particular little era is how
remarkably stable we've been since 1945

379
00:24:45,921 --> 00:24:49,730
when we demonstrated the ability
to use a nuclear weapons in anger.

380
00:24:50,210 --> 00:24:55,210
And we don't know why things like
that haven't happened since then.

381
00:24:58,280 --> 00:25:03,050
We've had several close calls. We've
had mistakes, we've had a brinksmanship.

382
00:25:03,410 --> 00:25:07,850
And what's now happened is that
we've settled into a sense that,

383
00:25:08,030 --> 00:25:10,460
oh, it's, it'll always be nothing.

384
00:25:10,700 --> 00:25:15,700
It's been so long since something was
at that level of danger that we've got a

385
00:25:19,581 --> 00:25:22,970
wrong idea in our head. And that's why
when I went into the Ben Shapiro show,

386
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:27,620
I talked about the need to resume
above ground testing of nuclear devices

387
00:25:28,070 --> 00:25:32,660
because we have people whose developmental
experience suggests that when,

388
00:25:32,840 --> 00:25:37,400
let's say Donald Trump and North
Korea engage on Twitter, oh,

389
00:25:37,401 --> 00:25:41,500
it's nothing. It's just
posturing. Everybody's just in
it for money. There's there,

390
00:25:41,501 --> 00:25:44,660
there's a sense that people
are in a video game mode,

391
00:25:45,140 --> 00:25:50,140
which has been the right call since 1945
we've been mostly in video game mode.

392
00:25:51,290 --> 00:25:52,123
It's amazing.

393
00:25:52,440 --> 00:25:56,420
So you're worried about a generation
which is not seeing any existential,

394
00:25:56,990 --> 00:26:01,540
we've lived under it. You see your
younger, I don't know if if, uh,

395
00:26:01,880 --> 00:26:06,200
again you came from, from
Moscow. Yeah. There was a,

396
00:26:06,730 --> 00:26:11,040
a TV show called the day after
that had a huge effect, uh,

397
00:26:11,060 --> 00:26:13,140
on a generation,
uh,

398
00:26:13,220 --> 00:26:18,140
growing up in the U s and it talked
about what life would be like after a

399
00:26:18,141 --> 00:26:19,250
nuclear exchange.

400
00:26:20,900 --> 00:26:25,900
We have not gone through
an embodied experience
collectively where we've thought

401
00:26:26,811 --> 00:26:27,381
about this.

402
00:26:27,381 --> 00:26:31,340
And I think it's one of the
most irresponsible things
that the elders among us

403
00:26:31,850 --> 00:26:32,683
have done,

404
00:26:32,690 --> 00:26:37,690
which is to provide this beautiful
garden in which the thorns are cut off of

405
00:26:41,331 --> 00:26:41,661
the,

406
00:26:41,661 --> 00:26:46,661
of the rose bushes and all of
the edges are rounded and sanded.

407
00:26:47,730 --> 00:26:50,850
And so people have developed this,
this totally unreal idea,

408
00:26:50,851 --> 00:26:52,920
which is everything's
going to be just fine.

409
00:26:53,880 --> 00:26:58,880
And do I think that my leading concern
is Agi or my leading concern is a

410
00:27:00,600 --> 00:27:04,680
thermonuclear exchange or gene drives or
any one of these things? I don't know.

411
00:27:05,610 --> 00:27:10,610
But I know that our time here in this
very long experiment here is finite

412
00:27:11,851 --> 00:27:16,680
because the toys that we've built are so
impressive and the wisdom to accompany

413
00:27:16,681 --> 00:27:18,510
them has not materialized.

414
00:27:18,930 --> 00:27:23,930
And I think we actually got
a wisdom uptick since 1945
we had a lot of dangerous

415
00:27:26,281 --> 00:27:29,160
skilled players on the world stage.
Nevertheless,

416
00:27:29,760 --> 00:27:33,750
no matter how bad they were
managed to not embroil us

417
00:27:35,370 --> 00:27:40,370
in something that we couldn't come back
from the Cold War and the distance from

418
00:27:40,441 --> 00:27:42,810
the Cold War.
You know,

419
00:27:42,840 --> 00:27:46,410
I'm very mindful of,
uh,

420
00:27:46,500 --> 00:27:51,500
there was a Russian tradition actually
of on your wedding day going to visit a,

421
00:27:53,550 --> 00:27:58,550
a memorial to those who gave their
lives. Can you imagine this, where you,

422
00:27:58,551 --> 00:28:00,210
you are the happiest day of your life.

423
00:28:00,211 --> 00:28:05,211
You go and you pay homage to the people
who fought and died in the battle of

424
00:28:05,431 --> 00:28:07,530
Stalingrad.
Um,

425
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:11,610
I'm not a huge fan of communism,
I gotta say,

426
00:28:11,730 --> 00:28:16,730
but there were a couple of things
that the Russians did that were really

427
00:28:17,341 --> 00:28:18,690
positive and the Soviet era.

428
00:28:18,720 --> 00:28:23,310
And I think trying to let people know
how serious life actually is, is a,

429
00:28:23,320 --> 00:28:27,570
is the Russian model of seriousness
is better than the American model.

430
00:28:28,350 --> 00:28:30,510
And maybe like you mentioned,

431
00:28:30,570 --> 00:28:34,920
there was a small echo of that
after nine 11, but we would,

432
00:28:34,921 --> 00:28:37,260
we wouldn't let it form.
We talk about nine 11,

433
00:28:37,261 --> 00:28:42,261
but it's nine 12 that really move the
needle when we were all just there and

434
00:28:43,051 --> 00:28:45,950
nobody wanted to speak.
We some,

435
00:28:45,970 --> 00:28:50,940
we witnessed something super
serious and we didn't want to, uh,

436
00:28:51,180 --> 00:28:52,290
run to

437
00:28:54,300 --> 00:28:57,720
our computers and blast out our
deep thoughts and our feelings.

438
00:28:59,130 --> 00:29:03,950
And it was profound because we
woke up briefly there. You know,

439
00:29:03,960 --> 00:29:08,400
I talk about the gated institutional
narrative and that sort of programs our

440
00:29:08,401 --> 00:29:11,190
lives,
I've seen it break three times in my life.

441
00:29:11,880 --> 00:29:13,980
One of which was the
election of Donald Trump.

442
00:29:14,970 --> 00:29:19,970
Another time was the fall of Lehman
brothers when everybody who knew that bear

443
00:29:20,881 --> 00:29:22,440
Stearns wasn't that important,

444
00:29:22,441 --> 00:29:26,490
knew that Lehman brothers
met AIG was next.

445
00:29:27,240 --> 00:29:31,350
And the other one was nine 11.
And so if I'm 53 years old,

446
00:29:31,351 --> 00:29:33,850
and I only remember three times that the,

447
00:29:33,960 --> 00:29:36,570
the global narrative
was really interrupted.

448
00:29:37,260 --> 00:29:42,260
That tells you how much we've
been on top of developing events.

449
00:29:42,880 --> 00:29:45,670
You know, I mean, we had the Moreau
felt federal building explosion,

450
00:29:45,671 --> 00:29:48,520
but it didn't cause the narrative
to break wasn't profound enough.

451
00:29:48,910 --> 00:29:51,100
Around nine 12,

452
00:29:51,490 --> 00:29:56,490
we started to wake up out of our slumber
and the powers that be did not want to

453
00:29:58,931 --> 00:30:03,820
coming together. They, you know, the, the,
the admonition was go shopping and uh,

454
00:30:03,880 --> 00:30:07,800
the powers that be was, what does that
force as opposed to blaming individually,

455
00:30:07,810 --> 00:30:11,440
we don't know. So whatever
that, whatever that force is,

456
00:30:11,720 --> 00:30:14,560
there's a component of it that's emergent
and there's a component of it that's

457
00:30:14,561 --> 00:30:18,250
deliberate. So give yourself a
portfolio with two components.

458
00:30:18,610 --> 00:30:19,990
Some amount of it is emergent,

459
00:30:21,220 --> 00:30:24,850
but some amount of it is
also an understanding that
if people come together,

460
00:30:25,240 --> 00:30:26,980
they become an incredible force.

461
00:30:27,580 --> 00:30:32,580
And what you're seeing right now I think
is there are forces that are trying to

462
00:30:33,790 --> 00:30:37,630
come together and there are forces
that are trying to push things apart.

463
00:30:38,980 --> 00:30:40,030
And you know,

464
00:30:40,031 --> 00:30:43,690
one of them is the globalist narrative
versus the national narrative where to

465
00:30:43,691 --> 00:30:47,360
the global, a globalist perspective, uh,

466
00:30:47,361 --> 00:30:51,760
the Nash nations are bad things
in essence that they're temporary,

467
00:30:51,761 --> 00:30:53,770
they're nationalistic,
they're jingoistic.

468
00:30:53,771 --> 00:30:58,200
It's all negative to people in the
national, more in the national idiom,

469
00:30:58,210 --> 00:31:00,370
they're saying, look, this
is where I pay my taxes.

470
00:31:00,580 --> 00:31:04,030
This is where I do my army service.
This is where I have a vote.

471
00:31:04,240 --> 00:31:07,870
This is where I have a passport.
Who the hell are you to tell me that?

472
00:31:07,871 --> 00:31:11,620
Because you've moved into someplace
that you can make money globally,

473
00:31:11,710 --> 00:31:15,610
that you've chosen to abandon other
people to whom you have a special and

474
00:31:15,611 --> 00:31:16,444
elevated duty.

475
00:31:16,810 --> 00:31:21,160
And I think that these
competing narratives have been
pushing towards the global

476
00:31:21,161 --> 00:31:22,930
perspective,
uh,

477
00:31:22,960 --> 00:31:27,040
from the elite and a larger and larger
number of disenfranchised people are

478
00:31:27,041 --> 00:31:29,680
saying, Hey, I actually live in a,

479
00:31:29,740 --> 00:31:32,800
in a place and I have laws and I
speak a language. I have a culture.

480
00:31:33,310 --> 00:31:35,590
And who are you to tell me that?

481
00:31:35,591 --> 00:31:40,591
Because you can profit in some far away
land that my obligations to my fellow

482
00:31:40,961 --> 00:31:42,970
country, men are so, so much diminished.

483
00:31:43,210 --> 00:31:45,280
So these tensions in
between nations and so on,

484
00:31:45,310 --> 00:31:48,580
ultimately you see being proud
of your country and so on,

485
00:31:48,581 --> 00:31:53,560
which creates potentially the kind
of things that led to wars and so on.

486
00:31:53,590 --> 00:31:58,300
They ultimately, it is human nature and
it is good for us, uh, for wake up calls,

487
00:31:58,330 --> 00:32:02,350
a different kinds of, oh, I think that
these are tensions. And my point isn't,

488
00:32:02,470 --> 00:32:03,730
I mean,
nationalism,

489
00:32:03,731 --> 00:32:08,731
run a muck is a nightmare
and internationalism run
a muck is a nightmare.

490
00:32:09,700 --> 00:32:14,650
And the problem is we're
trying to push these pendulums,

491
00:32:15,240 --> 00:32:18,160
uh, to some place where
they're somewhat balanced,

492
00:32:18,161 --> 00:32:23,161
where we have a higher duty of
care to those who share our log,

493
00:32:24,160 --> 00:32:25,660
our laws and our citizenship.

494
00:32:25,840 --> 00:32:29,080
But we don't forget our duties
of care to the global system.

495
00:32:30,940 --> 00:32:32,530
I would think this is elementary,

496
00:32:32,710 --> 00:32:37,710
but the problem that we're facing concerns
the ability for some to profit the

497
00:32:39,351 --> 00:32:44,351
event by abandoning their obligations
to others within their system.

498
00:32:45,290 --> 00:32:49,940
And that's what we've had for decades.
He mentioned nuclear weapons.

499
00:32:50,180 --> 00:32:54,710
I was hoping to get answers from you since
one of the many things you've done as

500
00:32:54,711 --> 00:32:55,970
a economics.

501
00:32:55,971 --> 00:32:59,840
It may be you can understand human
behavior of why the heck we haven't, uh,

502
00:32:59,841 --> 00:33:03,230
blowing each other up yet, but, okay.
So, uh, we'll get it. I know the answer.

503
00:33:03,231 --> 00:33:07,520
And you said it's a fast,
it's really important to say
that we really don't know.

504
00:33:07,680 --> 00:33:11,950
MILDEP up ticking wisdom, a mild uptake
and wisdom. That's was Steven pig.

505
00:33:12,340 --> 00:33:17,090
Bingo is who I've talked with has a
lot of really good ideas about why.

506
00:33:17,120 --> 00:33:19,340
But nobody,
I don't trust his optimism.

507
00:33:22,160 --> 00:33:25,340
Listen, I'm rushing, so I never trust the
guy. Was that optimists? No, no, no, no.

508
00:33:26,150 --> 00:33:31,150
You're talking about a guy who's looking
at a system in which more and more of

509
00:33:31,761 --> 00:33:36,620
the kinetic energy, like war has
been turned into potential energy,

510
00:33:36,650 --> 00:33:39,920
like unused nuclear weapon.
Beautifully put. And you know,

511
00:33:39,921 --> 00:33:42,320
now I'm looking at that
system and I'm saying, okay,

512
00:33:42,321 --> 00:33:45,110
well if you don't have a potential energy
term than everything's just getting

513
00:33:45,111 --> 00:33:50,090
better and better. Yeah. Wow. That's as
beautifully put. Only physicists. Got It.

514
00:33:50,091 --> 00:33:54,770
Okay. Uh, not a physicist.
Is that a dirty word?

515
00:33:55,310 --> 00:33:59,180
No, no. I wish I were a physicist.
A me too. My Dad's a physicist.

516
00:33:59,181 --> 00:34:01,370
I'm trying to live up that
probably for the rest of my life.

517
00:34:02,810 --> 00:34:05,900
He's probably going to listen
to this too. So he did. Yeah.

518
00:34:07,280 --> 00:34:12,050
So your friend Sam Harris, uh, worries a
lot about the existential threat of Ai,

519
00:34:13,640 --> 00:34:17,000
not in the way that you've described,
but in the more well,

520
00:34:17,001 --> 00:34:18,410
he hangs out with Ilan.
I don't know.

521
00:34:20,240 --> 00:34:24,290
So are you worried about
that kind of, uh, you know,

522
00:34:24,291 --> 00:34:27,010
about the,
um,

523
00:34:28,450 --> 00:34:31,250
about either robotic systems or,
you know,

524
00:34:31,251 --> 00:34:35,780
traditionally defined AI
systems essentially becoming
a superintelligent much

525
00:34:35,781 --> 00:34:38,290
more intelligent than human beings and,
uh,

526
00:34:38,350 --> 00:34:42,670
getting what they already
are and they're not, when,

527
00:34:42,680 --> 00:34:46,370
when seen as, um, a collective
you mean? Well, I mean,

528
00:34:46,440 --> 00:34:51,170
I can mean all sorts of
things, but certainly many
of the things that we thought

529
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:57,320
were peculiar to general intelligence
or do not require general intelligence.

530
00:34:57,321 --> 00:34:59,960
So that's been one of
the big awakenings that

531
00:35:01,490 --> 00:35:06,490
you can write a pretty convincing sports
story from stats alone without needing

532
00:35:07,971 --> 00:35:11,210
to have watched the game. So, you know,

533
00:35:11,211 --> 00:35:15,140
is it possible to write lively pros
about politics? Yeah, no, not yet.

534
00:35:17,090 --> 00:35:21,730
So we were sort of all over the map. One
of the, one of the things about chest,

535
00:35:21,930 --> 00:35:22,700
you'll,

536
00:35:22,700 --> 00:35:26,870
there's a question I once asked on
Quora that didn't get a lot of response,

537
00:35:26,871 --> 00:35:30,830
which was what is the greatest brilliancy
ever produced by a computer and a

538
00:35:30,831 --> 00:35:31,401
chess game,

539
00:35:31,401 --> 00:35:35,030
which was different than the question of
what is the greatest game ever played.

540
00:35:35,450 --> 00:35:38,910
So if you think about resiliencies is
what really animates many of us to think

541
00:35:38,911 --> 00:35:40,110
of chest as an art form,

542
00:35:42,050 --> 00:35:46,920
those are those moves and combinations
that just show such flare pinash and, and,

543
00:35:46,970 --> 00:35:50,480
and, and soul. Um, computers
weren't really great at that.

544
00:35:50,481 --> 00:35:52,910
They were great positional monsters.
And

545
00:35:54,140 --> 00:35:55,050
you know,
recently we,

546
00:35:55,160 --> 00:35:59,930
we've started seeing brilliancy and so
you're grand masters have identified with

547
00:35:59,931 --> 00:36:03,880
that with Alpha zero that things were
quite brilliant. Yeah. So that's great.

548
00:36:03,890 --> 00:36:04,723
That's it. That's it. You know,

549
00:36:04,730 --> 00:36:07,580
that's an example of something
we don't think that that's Agi,

550
00:36:07,581 --> 00:36:11,180
but in a very restricted set,
a set of rules like chess,

551
00:36:11,650 --> 00:36:16,150
you're starting to see
poetry of a high order and,

552
00:36:17,120 --> 00:36:21,120
and so I'm not, I don't like the
idea that we're waiting for Agi.

553
00:36:21,170 --> 00:36:26,170
Agi is sort of slowly infiltrating our
lives in the same way that I don't think

554
00:36:28,161 --> 00:36:29,890
a worm should be.
You know,

555
00:36:29,910 --> 00:36:34,040
the sea elegans shouldn't be treated
as nonconscious because it only has 300

556
00:36:34,041 --> 00:36:38,270
neurons and maybe just has a very low
level of consciousness because we don't

557
00:36:38,271 --> 00:36:40,310
understand what these things
mean as they scale up.

558
00:36:40,700 --> 00:36:44,060
So am I worried about this
general phenomena? Sure.

559
00:36:44,061 --> 00:36:47,720
But I think that one of the things
that's happening is that a lot of us are

560
00:36:47,721 --> 00:36:52,250
fretting about this, uh, in
part because of human needs.

561
00:36:53,490 --> 00:36:56,360
We've always been worried
about the Gollum, right?

562
00:36:57,290 --> 00:37:01,570
Well, the gums, the artificially created
life, you know, it's like Frankenstein.

563
00:37:01,650 --> 00:37:03,630
Yeah, sure. It's a Jewish version

564
00:37:04,030 --> 00:37:08,770
and um,
Frankenberg Frankenstein.

565
00:37:08,870 --> 00:37:11,590
That's makes sense. All right, so the, uh,

566
00:37:12,970 --> 00:37:16,960
but we've always been worried about
creating something like this and it's

567
00:37:16,961 --> 00:37:20,200
getting closer and closer
and there are ways in which

568
00:37:23,410 --> 00:37:26,410
we have to realize that the whole thing
has come up with a whole thing that

569
00:37:26,411 --> 00:37:31,411
we've experienced are the context of our
lives is almost certainly coming to an

570
00:37:31,781 --> 00:37:36,260
end. And I don't mean to suggest that, uh,

571
00:37:36,261 --> 00:37:38,210
we won't survive.
I don't know.

572
00:37:38,940 --> 00:37:41,860
And I don't mean to suggest that it's
coming tomorrow and it could be 300,

573
00:37:41,861 --> 00:37:42,760
500 years,

574
00:37:43,540 --> 00:37:46,930
but there's no plan that I'm aware of.

575
00:37:46,960 --> 00:37:50,090
If we have three rocks that we
could possibly inhabit that are

576
00:37:51,730 --> 00:37:55,870
sensible within current
technological dreams, the earth,

577
00:37:55,900 --> 00:37:57,280
the moon and Mars,

578
00:37:57,850 --> 00:38:02,850
and we have a very competitive
civilization that is
still forced into violence

579
00:38:04,511 --> 00:38:06,680
to sort out disputes that
cannot be arbitrated.

580
00:38:07,390 --> 00:38:11,740
It is not clear to me that we have a
longterm future until we get to the next

581
00:38:11,741 --> 00:38:12,574
stage,

582
00:38:12,850 --> 00:38:17,470
which is to figure out whether or not the
Einsteinian speed limit can be broken.

583
00:38:17,770 --> 00:38:19,690
And that requires our source code,

584
00:38:21,480 --> 00:38:24,760
our source code, the stuff in
our brains to figure out what,

585
00:38:24,800 --> 00:38:27,840
what do you mean by our source code?
The source code of the context,

586
00:38:27,841 --> 00:38:32,160
whatever it is that produces the
corks, the electrons, the Neutrino I,

587
00:38:32,220 --> 00:38:36,070
our source code. I got it.
So this is like, like you're
talking to your best stuff

588
00:38:36,070 --> 00:38:39,190
that's written in a higher level
language. Yeah. If his right,

589
00:38:39,191 --> 00:38:41,440
you're talking about the
low level, uh, the bits,

590
00:38:42,130 --> 00:38:46,090
that's what is currently keeping us here.

591
00:38:46,510 --> 00:38:50,470
We can't even imagine,
you know,

592
00:38:50,500 --> 00:38:55,220
we have harebrained schemes for staying
within the Einsteinian speed limit. Uh,

593
00:38:55,410 --> 00:38:55,810
you know,

594
00:38:55,810 --> 00:38:59,080
maybe if we could just drug ourselves
and go into a suspended state or we could

595
00:38:59,081 --> 00:39:02,200
have multiple generations,
I think all that stuff is pretty silly.

596
00:39:02,740 --> 00:39:07,030
But I think it's also pretty silly to
imagine that our wisdom is going to

597
00:39:07,031 --> 00:39:11,330
increase to the point that we
can have the toys we have and uh,

598
00:39:11,530 --> 00:39:15,160
we're not going to use them for 500 years.
Speaking of Einstein,

599
00:39:16,040 --> 00:39:19,090
I had a profound break that
when I realized you're just
one letter away from the

600
00:39:19,091 --> 00:39:23,950
guy, but I'm also one letter
away from Feinstein. It's,

601
00:39:23,980 --> 00:39:28,750
well, you get to pick. Okay.
So unified theory, you know,

602
00:39:28,751 --> 00:39:32,110
you've worked a, you, you
enjoy the beauty of geometry.

603
00:39:32,690 --> 00:39:34,240
I don't actually know if you enjoy it.

604
00:39:34,300 --> 00:39:39,100
You certainly are quite
good at is Trumbull before
tremble before it is that if

605
00:39:39,101 --> 00:39:42,100
you are religious, that is one of
the good, I have to be religious.

606
00:39:42,101 --> 00:39:44,990
It's just so beautiful. You
will tremble anyway. I mean,

607
00:39:45,320 --> 00:39:50,200
I just read to Einstein's
biography and one of the ways,

608
00:39:50,440 --> 00:39:54,980
one of the things you've done is tried
to explore a, a unified theory, uh,

609
00:39:55,150 --> 00:40:00,150
talking about a 14 dimensional opposite
verse that has the four d space time

610
00:40:00,311 --> 00:40:01,840
continuum embedded in it.

611
00:40:02,760 --> 00:40:07,760
I just curious how you think and how it
philosophically at a high level about

612
00:40:08,890 --> 00:40:13,240
something more than four
dimensions. Uh, how do you try to,

613
00:40:13,360 --> 00:40:14,740
what does it make you feel

614
00:40:16,630 --> 00:40:20,290
talking in the mathematical world about
dimensions that are greater than the

615
00:40:20,291 --> 00:40:23,340
ones we can perceive is,

616
00:40:23,390 --> 00:40:27,250
is there something that you take away
that's more than just the math? Well,

617
00:40:27,251 --> 00:40:28,840
first of all,
stick out your tongue at me.

618
00:40:32,470 --> 00:40:36,520
Okay. Now on the front of that time, yeah,

619
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:38,230
there was a sweet receptor

620
00:40:40,400 --> 00:40:44,260
and next to that we're salt
receptors and two different sides.

621
00:40:44,440 --> 00:40:45,370
A little bit farther back,

622
00:40:45,371 --> 00:40:48,190
there were sour receptors and you wouldn't
show me the back of your tongue where

623
00:40:48,191 --> 00:40:51,640
you're bitter receptor was show
the good side always. Okay.

624
00:40:51,760 --> 00:40:55,510
But that was four dimensions
of taste receptors.

625
00:40:56,440 --> 00:41:00,340
But you also had pain receptors on the
tongue and probably heat receptors on

626
00:41:00,341 --> 00:41:04,480
that time. So let's assume that you had
one of each, that would be six dimensions.

627
00:41:05,260 --> 00:41:09,910
So when you eat something, you eat
a slice of pizza and it's got some,

628
00:41:10,120 --> 00:41:14,290
some uh, some hot pepper
on it, maybe some Jalapeno,

629
00:41:15,040 --> 00:41:16,930
you're having a six
dimensional experience. Dude,

630
00:41:17,620 --> 00:41:22,620
do you think we overemphasize the value
of time as one of the dimensions or

631
00:41:23,830 --> 00:41:24,311
space?

632
00:41:24,311 --> 00:41:27,520
What we certainly over emphasize the value
of time cause we like things to start

633
00:41:27,521 --> 00:41:30,940
and end or we really don't like
things to end, but they seem to, well,

634
00:41:30,941 --> 00:41:34,790
what if you flipped one of the spatial
into being a temporal dimension

635
00:41:36,700 --> 00:41:40,450
and you and I were to meet
in New York City and say,

636
00:41:40,620 --> 00:41:42,400
well were where and when
should we meet and say,

637
00:41:42,401 --> 00:41:47,401
how about I'll meet you on 36th and
Lexington at two in the afternoon and uh,

638
00:41:50,050 --> 00:41:54,200
11 o'clock in the morning.
That would be very confusing.

639
00:41:56,520 --> 00:41:59,240
Well, so it's a convenient for us to
think about Tommy, you mean? All right.

640
00:41:59,250 --> 00:42:03,060
We happened to be in a delicious situation
in which we have three dimensions of

641
00:42:03,061 --> 00:42:07,440
space and one of time and they're woven
together in this sort of strange fabric

642
00:42:07,441 --> 00:42:09,390
where we can trade off a
little space for a little time,

643
00:42:09,391 --> 00:42:13,080
but we still only have one dimension
that is picked out relative to the other

644
00:42:13,081 --> 00:42:15,000
three.
It's very much Gladys knight and the pips,

645
00:42:15,530 --> 00:42:20,150
so which one developed for who do we
develop for these dimensions or did the

646
00:42:20,151 --> 00:42:23,180
dimensions or were they
always there and it doesn't?

647
00:42:23,610 --> 00:42:23,761
Well,

648
00:42:23,761 --> 00:42:27,150
do you imagine that there isn't a place
where there are four temporal dimensions

649
00:42:27,151 --> 00:42:31,470
or two and to have space and time or three
of time in one of space and then with

650
00:42:31,560 --> 00:42:33,420
time not be playing the role of space.

651
00:42:33,780 --> 00:42:36,750
Why do you imagine that the sector
that you're in is all that there is?

652
00:42:37,550 --> 00:42:40,790
I certainly do not,
but I can't imagine otherwise.

653
00:42:40,820 --> 00:42:45,500
I mean I haven't done Iowasca or any,
any of those drugs that hope to one day,

654
00:42:45,860 --> 00:42:48,650
but so doing Iowasca you could
just head over to building too.

655
00:42:49,490 --> 00:42:51,370
That's where the mathematicians
are. Yeah. That's where they hang.

656
00:42:52,040 --> 00:42:55,490
Just to look at some geometry. We'll just
ask about pseudo Romani and geometry.

657
00:42:55,491 --> 00:42:58,450
That's what you're interested in.
Okay.

658
00:42:58,520 --> 00:43:02,570
Or You can talk to a Sharma and then
ended up in Peru and then it's an extra

659
00:43:02,571 --> 00:43:03,100
money for that.

660
00:43:03,100 --> 00:43:06,200
You won't be able to do any calculations
if that's how you choose to go about it.

661
00:43:06,410 --> 00:43:10,730
Well, a different kind of calculation so
to speak. Yeah. One of my favorite people,

662
00:43:10,731 --> 00:43:14,870
Edward Frankl, Berkeley professor, author
of love and math, great title for a book,

663
00:43:15,440 --> 00:43:16,940
uh,
said uh,

664
00:43:16,941 --> 00:43:21,440
that your quite a remarkable intellect
to come up with such beautiful original

665
00:43:21,441 --> 00:43:25,030
ideas
in terms of the unified theory and so on,

666
00:43:25,031 --> 00:43:27,160
but you are working outside academia.

667
00:43:28,060 --> 00:43:32,500
So one question in developing
ideas that truly original,

668
00:43:32,530 --> 00:43:33,430
truly interesting.

669
00:43:33,460 --> 00:43:38,460
What's the difference between
inside academia and outside
academia when it comes

670
00:43:39,221 --> 00:43:40,990
to developing such a terrible choice?

671
00:43:41,540 --> 00:43:46,150
Terrible choice.
So if you do it inside of academics,

672
00:43:46,840 --> 00:43:50,260
you are forced to constantly

673
00:43:53,480 --> 00:43:58,480
show great loyalty to the consensus and
you distinguish yourself with small,

674
00:44:00,300 --> 00:44:04,890
almost microscopic heresies, uh,
to make your reputation in general.

675
00:44:07,120 --> 00:44:11,540
And you have very competent people and
brilliant people who are working together

676
00:44:11,541 --> 00:44:12,374
who are

677
00:44:13,550 --> 00:44:18,550
form very deep social networks and
have a very high level of behavior,

678
00:44:21,120 --> 00:44:24,900
at least within mathematics and at
least technically within physics,

679
00:44:25,110 --> 00:44:26,010
theoretical physics.

680
00:44:27,720 --> 00:44:31,200
When you go outside you beat
lunatics and crazy people

681
00:44:33,300 --> 00:44:34,133
madmen.

682
00:44:34,710 --> 00:44:39,710
And these are people who do not usually
subscribe to the consensus position and

683
00:44:40,561 --> 00:44:42,180
almost always lose their way.

684
00:44:43,740 --> 00:44:46,380
And the key question is,

685
00:44:46,770 --> 00:44:51,770
will progress likely come from someone
who is miraculously managed to stay

686
00:44:53,761 --> 00:44:58,761
within the system and is able to take on
a larger amount of heresy that is sort

687
00:44:59,131 --> 00:45:03,960
of unthinkable, uh, in which
case that will be fascinating.

688
00:45:04,500 --> 00:45:09,270
Or is it more likely that somebody will
maintain a level of discipline from

689
00:45:09,271 --> 00:45:14,271
outside of academics and be able to make
use of the freedom that comes from not

690
00:45:16,681 --> 00:45:21,210
having to constantly affirm your
loyalty to the consensus of your field?

691
00:45:21,690 --> 00:45:23,590
So you've characterized
in ways that I could,

692
00:45:23,790 --> 00:45:27,780
academia in this particular
sense is a declining,

693
00:45:27,810 --> 00:45:29,880
you are posted a plot.

694
00:45:30,240 --> 00:45:34,230
The older population of the
faculty's getting larger,

695
00:45:34,350 --> 00:45:37,860
the younger is getting smaller and so on.
So what's,

696
00:45:37,890 --> 00:45:40,800
which direction of the two are
you more hopeful about? Well,

697
00:45:40,801 --> 00:45:44,580
the baby boomers can't hang on forever.
Was it first of all in general, true.

698
00:45:44,581 --> 00:45:46,380
And second of all in academia.

699
00:45:46,400 --> 00:45:50,410
But that's really what I think what
this time is about is the baby boomers.

700
00:45:50,490 --> 00:45:51,323
We didn't,
we're,

701
00:45:51,340 --> 00:45:55,920
we're used to like financial bubbles
that lasts a few years in length and then

702
00:45:55,921 --> 00:46:00,921
pop the baby boomer bubble is this
really long lived thing and all of the

703
00:46:02,521 --> 00:46:07,090
ideology, all of the behavior
patterns, the norms, you know,

704
00:46:07,170 --> 00:46:10,710
for example, string theory is and
almost entirely baby boomer phenomenon.

705
00:46:11,550 --> 00:46:15,180
It was something that baby boomers were
able to do because it required a very

706
00:46:15,181 --> 00:46:18,270
high level of mathematical ability.

707
00:46:19,890 --> 00:46:24,420
You don't, you don't think of a
strength theory as a, an original idea.

708
00:46:24,840 --> 00:46:28,380
Oh, I mean it was original to Veneziano
would probably is older than the baby

709
00:46:28,381 --> 00:46:32,310
boomers and there are people
who are younger than the
baby boomers who are still

710
00:46:32,311 --> 00:46:33,300
doing string theory.

711
00:46:33,301 --> 00:46:37,170
And I'm not saying that nothing discovered
within the large string theoretic

712
00:46:37,171 --> 00:46:39,390
complex is wrong.
Quite the contrary.

713
00:46:39,420 --> 00:46:43,770
A lot of brilliant mathematics and a
lot of the structure of physics was

714
00:46:43,771 --> 00:46:45,480
elucidated by string theorists.

715
00:46:46,770 --> 00:46:51,120
What do I think of the deliverable
nature of this product that will not ship

716
00:46:51,210 --> 00:46:52,440
called string theory?

717
00:46:52,470 --> 00:46:56,670
I think that it is largely an
affirmative action program for highly

718
00:46:56,671 --> 00:47:01,671
mathematically and geometrically talented
baby boomer physics physicists so that

719
00:47:02,461 --> 00:47:07,461
they can say that they're working on
something within the constraints of what

720
00:47:08,251 --> 00:47:12,390
they will say is quantum gravity. Now
there are other schemes, you know,

721
00:47:12,391 --> 00:47:14,100
there's like ask them Todrick safety.

722
00:47:14,520 --> 00:47:17,070
There are other things that
you could imagine doing.

723
00:47:17,071 --> 00:47:20,010
I don't think much of any
of the major programs,

724
00:47:20,730 --> 00:47:24,480
but to have inflicted this level of

725
00:47:26,250 --> 00:47:27,930
loyalty through a Shibboleth.
Well,

726
00:47:27,931 --> 00:47:32,230
surely you don't question y question
almost everything in the string program,

727
00:47:32,790 --> 00:47:35,740
and that's why I got out of physics
when you called me a physicist.

728
00:47:35,920 --> 00:47:36,910
It was a great honor,

729
00:47:37,300 --> 00:47:40,300
but the reason I didn't become a
physicist wasn't that I fell in love with

730
00:47:40,301 --> 00:47:44,710
mathematics. As I said.
Wow. In 1984, 1983,

731
00:47:44,950 --> 00:47:48,700
I saw the field going mad
and I saw that mathematics,

732
00:47:48,701 --> 00:47:52,240
which has all sorts of problems,
was not going insane.

733
00:47:52,870 --> 00:47:55,480
And so instead of studying
things within physics,

734
00:47:55,481 --> 00:47:59,170
I thought it was much safer to study
the same objects within mathematics.

735
00:47:59,720 --> 00:48:02,860
And there's a huge price to pay for that.
You lose physical intuition.

736
00:48:03,400 --> 00:48:07,630
But the point is, is that it wasn't a
North Korean reeducation camp either.

737
00:48:08,170 --> 00:48:13,170
Are you hopeful about cracking open the
Einstein unified theory in a way that

738
00:48:13,811 --> 00:48:16,060
has been really, really, uh,

739
00:48:16,450 --> 00:48:21,450
understanding whether a uniting everything
together with content Tyrian so on.

740
00:48:21,840 --> 00:48:26,840
I mean I'm trying to play this role
myself to do it well if you the extent of

741
00:48:27,581 --> 00:48:32,260
handing it over to the more responsible,
more professional,

742
00:48:32,261 --> 00:48:35,080
more competent community.
Um,

743
00:48:35,140 --> 00:48:39,010
so I think that they're wrong about a
great number of their belief structures,

744
00:48:39,550 --> 00:48:41,590
but I do believe,

745
00:48:42,090 --> 00:48:46,030
I mean I have a really profound love hate
relationship with this group of people.

746
00:48:46,780 --> 00:48:48,040
I think the physics side,
Oh yeah.

747
00:48:48,640 --> 00:48:52,480
Because the mathematician is actually
seem to be much more open minded and uh,

748
00:48:52,660 --> 00:48:54,060
well they are and there aren't,

749
00:48:54,100 --> 00:48:58,000
they're open minded but anything that
looks like great math, right? Right.

750
00:48:58,001 --> 00:49:00,160
They'll study something that
isn't very important physics,

751
00:49:00,161 --> 00:49:03,430
but if it's beautiful
mathematics then they'll have uh,

752
00:49:03,460 --> 00:49:07,900
they have great intuition about these
things. As good as the mathematicians are.

753
00:49:07,901 --> 00:49:11,980
And I might even intellectually at some
horsepower level, give them the edge.

754
00:49:12,700 --> 00:49:16,540
The theoretics theoretical
physics community is bar none.

755
00:49:16,570 --> 00:49:21,100
The most profound intellectual
community that we have ever created.

756
00:49:21,880 --> 00:49:25,930
It is the number one, there is nobody
in second place as far as I concerned,

757
00:49:25,931 --> 00:49:30,550
look in their spare time and the spare
time they invented molecular biology.

758
00:49:31,060 --> 00:49:33,640
What, what was the origin of
molecular biology? You're saying Phil?

759
00:49:33,650 --> 00:49:35,350
Somebody like Francis Crick.
I mean a lot,

760
00:49:35,390 --> 00:49:40,020
a lot of the early molecular
biologists or physicists. Yeah, I mean,

761
00:49:40,120 --> 00:49:44,410
you know, Schrodinger wrote what is
life and that was highly inspirational.

762
00:49:44,440 --> 00:49:47,290
I mean you have to appreciate that

763
00:49:48,850 --> 00:49:53,850
there is no community like the basic
research community in theoretical physics.

764
00:49:54,670 --> 00:49:59,350
And it's not something I'm
highly critical of these guys.

765
00:49:59,380 --> 00:50:01,270
I think that they would just wasted,
you know,

766
00:50:01,450 --> 00:50:06,080
decades of time with,
um,

767
00:50:06,580 --> 00:50:09,880
and your religious devotion
to their misconceptions,

768
00:50:09,881 --> 00:50:12,760
realization of where the
problems were in physics.

769
00:50:13,210 --> 00:50:17,740
But this has been the
greatest intellectual
collapse ever witnessed within

770
00:50:17,741 --> 00:50:22,030
academics.
You see it as a collapse or just a little,

771
00:50:22,750 --> 00:50:25,660
oh, I'm terrified that we're
about to lose the vitality.

772
00:50:25,900 --> 00:50:29,190
We can't afford to pay these people.
Um,

773
00:50:29,240 --> 00:50:33,110
we can't afford to give
them an accelerator just to
play with in case they find

774
00:50:33,111 --> 00:50:37,070
something at the next energy level.
These people created our economy.

775
00:50:38,210 --> 00:50:41,780
They gave us the Rad lab and radar.

776
00:50:41,810 --> 00:50:45,470
They gave us two atomic
devices to end World War II.

777
00:50:45,500 --> 00:50:49,880
They created the semiconductor and the
transistor to power our economy through

778
00:50:49,881 --> 00:50:54,680
Moore's law. Uh, as a positive
externality of particle accelerators.

779
00:50:54,681 --> 00:50:59,450
They created the worldwide web.
And we have the insolence to say,

780
00:51:00,050 --> 00:51:03,740
why should we fund you with our tax
payer dollars? No. The question is,

781
00:51:04,130 --> 00:51:08,370
are you enjoying your
physics dollars? Right? We,

782
00:51:08,440 --> 00:51:12,020
these guys signed the world's
worst licensing agreement. Right?

783
00:51:12,350 --> 00:51:13,730
And if,

784
00:51:13,940 --> 00:51:18,940
if they simply charged for every time
you used a transistor or a URL a or

785
00:51:19,851 --> 00:51:24,470
enjoyed the piece that they have
provided, um, during this period of time,

786
00:51:24,471 --> 00:51:27,800
through the terrible weapons
that they developed, uh,

787
00:51:27,860 --> 00:51:31,820
or your communications devices,
all of the things that power our economy,

788
00:51:32,300 --> 00:51:33,890
I really think came out of physics.

789
00:51:33,890 --> 00:51:36,920
Even to the extent the chemistry came
out of physics and molecular biology came

790
00:51:36,921 --> 00:51:39,380
out of physics.
So first of all,

791
00:51:39,410 --> 00:51:43,250
you have to know that I'm very critical
of this community. Second of all,

792
00:51:43,280 --> 00:51:46,970
it is our most important community.
We have neglected it, we've abused it,

793
00:51:47,570 --> 00:51:49,070
we don't take it seriously.

794
00:51:49,700 --> 00:51:54,590
We don't even care to get them to rehab
after a couple of generations of failure,

795
00:51:55,310 --> 00:51:56,160
right?
No one,

796
00:51:56,370 --> 00:52:01,100
I think the youngest person to have really
contributed to the standard model of

797
00:52:01,101 --> 00:52:05,930
theater medical level was
born in 1951 right? Frank,

798
00:52:05,931 --> 00:52:10,640
we'll check and almost
nothing has happened, um,

799
00:52:11,210 --> 00:52:16,210
that in theoretical physics after 1973
74 that sent somebody to Stockholm

800
00:52:18,680 --> 00:52:21,110
for theoretical development,
that predicted experiment.

801
00:52:21,590 --> 00:52:25,910
So we have to understand that we are doing
this to ourselves. Now with that said,

802
00:52:26,240 --> 00:52:30,500
these guys have behaved
abysmally in my opinion, um,

803
00:52:30,530 --> 00:52:33,380
because they haven't owned up
to where they actually are,

804
00:52:33,410 --> 00:52:36,770
what problems they're really facing,
how definite they can actually be.

805
00:52:37,280 --> 00:52:40,010
They haven't shared some of their
most brilliant discoveries which are

806
00:52:40,011 --> 00:52:42,890
desperately needed in other
fields like gauge theory,

807
00:52:43,130 --> 00:52:45,590
which at least the
mathematicians can can share,

808
00:52:45,591 --> 00:52:49,280
which is an upgrade of the differential
calculus of Newton in live nuts and they

809
00:52:49,281 --> 00:52:52,850
haven't shared the importance
of renormalization theory. Uh,

810
00:52:52,851 --> 00:52:56,930
even though this should be standard
operating procedure for people across the

811
00:52:56,931 --> 00:53:01,040
sciences, dealing with different layers
and different levels of phenomenon.

812
00:53:01,080 --> 00:53:01,701
So shared,

813
00:53:01,701 --> 00:53:06,290
you mean communicated in such a way
that a dis disseminates throughout the

814
00:53:06,291 --> 00:53:07,940
different of these guys are sitting,

815
00:53:07,941 --> 00:53:12,650
both theoretical physicists
and mathematicians are
sitting on top of a giant

816
00:53:12,651 --> 00:53:16,250
stockpile of intellectual gold,
right?

817
00:53:16,280 --> 00:53:20,600
They have so many things that have not
been manifested anywhere. I was just on

818
00:53:22,280 --> 00:53:22,671
Twitter,

819
00:53:22,671 --> 00:53:26,160
I think I mentioned the Habermann switch
pitch that shows the self duality of

820
00:53:26,161 --> 00:53:29,740
the tetrahedron realized
as a linkage mechanism. No,

821
00:53:29,741 --> 00:53:34,650
this is like a triviality and
it makes an amazing toy that's,

822
00:53:34,651 --> 00:53:38,940
you know, built a market. Hopefully
a fortune for chuck Hoberman. Well,

823
00:53:39,090 --> 00:53:43,260
you have no idea how much great stuff that
these priests have in their monastery.

824
00:53:44,580 --> 00:53:47,900
So it's truly a love and hate
relationship for you. Well,

825
00:53:47,910 --> 00:53:51,140
it sounds like it's more on the love this
building that we're in right here. Yes.

826
00:53:51,610 --> 00:53:51,930
Uh,

827
00:53:51,930 --> 00:53:56,930
is the building in which I really put
together the conspiracy between the

828
00:53:57,610 --> 00:54:00,270
National Academy of Sciences and the
National Science Foundation through the

829
00:54:00,271 --> 00:54:04,470
government university industry research
round table to destroy the bargaining

830
00:54:04,471 --> 00:54:07,080
power of American academics,
uh,

831
00:54:07,110 --> 00:54:11,370
using foreign labor with a on
microfiche and not in the base. Oh yeah.

832
00:54:11,400 --> 00:54:13,670
That was done here in this building.
Isn't that weird?

833
00:54:13,940 --> 00:54:18,790
And I'm truly speaking with
a revolutionary and radical
a, I don't know. No, no, no,

834
00:54:18,791 --> 00:54:21,590
no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
At an intellectual level, yes,

835
00:54:22,080 --> 00:54:26,910
I am absolutely garden variety.
I'm just straight down the middle.

836
00:54:27,540 --> 00:54:29,880
The system that we are in this,

837
00:54:29,940 --> 00:54:33,710
this university is functionally insane.
Yeah.

838
00:54:34,680 --> 00:54:39,680
Harvard is functionally insane and we
don't understand that when we get these

839
00:54:40,351 --> 00:54:43,080
things wrong,
the financial crisis made this very clear.

840
00:54:43,560 --> 00:54:48,330
There was a long period where every
grown up, everybody with a tie, uh,

841
00:54:48,360 --> 00:54:52,680
who spoken in bear
baritone tones, uh, with,

842
00:54:52,770 --> 00:54:56,340
with the right degree, uh, at
the end of their name. Yeah. Uh,

843
00:54:56,710 --> 00:55:00,570
talking about how we banish volunteer
volatility, we're in the great moderation.

844
00:55:01,890 --> 00:55:05,100
Okay. They were all crazy.
And who was, who was right?

845
00:55:05,190 --> 00:55:09,700
It was like Nassim Taleb Nouriel Roubini.
Now what happens is,

846
00:55:09,701 --> 00:55:14,580
is that they claimed the market went, went
crazy, but the market didn't go crazy.

847
00:55:14,581 --> 00:55:18,330
The market had been crazy.
And what happened is, is
that it suddenly went sane.

848
00:55:19,020 --> 00:55:20,790
Well,
that's where we are with academics.

849
00:55:21,090 --> 00:55:25,530
Academics right now is mad as a
hatter and it's absolutely evident.

850
00:55:25,531 --> 00:55:28,530
I can show you graph after graph.
I can show you the internal discussions.

851
00:55:28,530 --> 00:55:30,090
I can show you the conspiracies.

852
00:55:30,510 --> 00:55:34,620
Harvard's dealing with one right now
over a its admissions policies for people

853
00:55:35,040 --> 00:55:37,380
of Color, uh, who happened
to come from Asia.

854
00:55:38,160 --> 00:55:41,190
All of this madness is necessary
to keep the game going.

855
00:55:41,850 --> 00:55:46,080
What we're talking about, just while
we're on the topic of revolutionaries,

856
00:55:46,260 --> 00:55:50,970
as we're talking about the danger
of an outbreak of sanity, yeah.

857
00:55:50,971 --> 00:55:51,271
You're,

858
00:55:51,271 --> 00:55:55,980
you're the guy pointing out the elephant
in the room here and the elephant has

859
00:55:55,981 --> 00:55:58,980
no clothes.
Is that how that goes?

860
00:55:59,580 --> 00:56:03,410
I was going to talk a
little bit to, uh, uh,

861
00:56:03,670 --> 00:56:08,250
Joe Rogan about this man at a time,
but I think you're,

862
00:56:08,251 --> 00:56:11,850
you have some,
you can just listen to you.

863
00:56:11,851 --> 00:56:15,450
You could probably speak really
eloquently to academia on the differences

864
00:56:15,451 --> 00:56:16,500
between the different fields.

865
00:56:16,501 --> 00:56:21,090
So you think there's a difference between
science and engineering and then the

866
00:56:21,091 --> 00:56:25,270
humanities in academia in
terms of tolerance that
they're willing to tolerate.

867
00:56:25,700 --> 00:56:27,670
So from my perspective,
I thought

868
00:56:29,830 --> 00:56:34,300
computer science and maybe engineering
is more tolerant to radical ideas,

869
00:56:34,690 --> 00:56:38,350
but that's perhaps innocent of
me is that I always, you know,

870
00:56:38,351 --> 00:56:41,530
all the battles going on now or a
little bit more on the humanity side and

871
00:56:41,531 --> 00:56:44,490
gender studies and so on.
Have you seen the, uh,

872
00:56:44,860 --> 00:56:48,820
American Mathematical Society
is publication of an essay
called get out the way?

873
00:56:49,450 --> 00:56:51,040
I have not.
What's,

874
00:56:51,100 --> 00:56:56,100
what's the idea is that white men who
hold positions within universities and

875
00:56:57,341 --> 00:57:02,341
mathematics should vacate their position
so that young black women can take over

876
00:57:02,500 --> 00:57:04,840
something like this.
That's in terms of diversity,

877
00:57:04,841 --> 00:57:06,100
which I also want to ask you about.

878
00:57:06,101 --> 00:57:10,420
But in terms of diversity
of strictly ideas, I'm sure.

879
00:57:10,990 --> 00:57:11,950
Do you think,

880
00:57:12,340 --> 00:57:15,790
cause you're basically saying physics
as a community has become a little bit

881
00:57:15,791 --> 00:57:20,791
intolerant to some degree to new
radical ideas or at least you,

882
00:57:21,101 --> 00:57:23,260
uh, you said that's changed
a little bit recently,

883
00:57:24,160 --> 00:57:28,870
which is that even string theory
is now admitting, okay, we don't,

884
00:57:29,380 --> 00:57:32,470
this doesn't look very promising
in the short term. Right?

885
00:57:32,800 --> 00:57:35,800
So the question is what compiles,

886
00:57:36,970 --> 00:57:38,980
if you want to take the
computer science metaphor,

887
00:57:39,580 --> 00:57:41,200
what will get you into a journal?

888
00:57:41,890 --> 00:57:46,450
Will you spend your life trying to push
some paper into a journal or will it be

889
00:57:46,451 --> 00:57:49,840
accepted easily? What do we know about
the characteristics of the submitter

890
00:57:51,910 --> 00:57:55,270
and what gets taken up and what does not?

891
00:57:56,560 --> 00:58:01,000
All of these fields are experiencing
pressure because no field is performing so

892
00:58:01,001 --> 00:58:03,530
brilliantly? Well, um,

893
00:58:03,610 --> 00:58:06,070
that it's revolutionizing

894
00:58:08,260 --> 00:58:12,400
our way of speaking and thinking in the
ways in which we've become accustomed.

895
00:58:12,760 --> 00:58:15,700
But don't you think even
in theoretical physics,

896
00:58:17,020 --> 00:58:20,710
a lot of times, even with theories,
extinct theory, you could speak to this.

897
00:58:21,070 --> 00:58:25,090
It does eventually too. What are the
ways that this theory would be testable?

898
00:58:26,090 --> 00:58:28,660
And so ultimately,
although look,

899
00:58:28,690 --> 00:58:32,950
there's this thing about popper and the
scientific method that's a cancer and a

900
00:58:32,951 --> 00:58:35,890
disease in the minds of very smart people.

901
00:58:36,220 --> 00:58:39,790
That's not really how most
of the stuff gets worked out.

902
00:58:39,791 --> 00:58:42,430
It's how it gets checked, right? So,

903
00:58:42,490 --> 00:58:44,680
and there is a dialogue
between theory and experiment,

904
00:58:45,490 --> 00:58:47,800
but everybody should read.

905
00:58:47,830 --> 00:58:52,830
Paul Directs 1963 American
scientific American article where he,

906
00:58:55,820 --> 00:58:57,760
he, you know, it's very interesting,

907
00:58:57,761 --> 00:59:01,210
he talks about it as if it was about the
Schrodinger equation and Schrodinger's

908
00:59:01,211 --> 00:59:05,710
failure to advances on work because
of his failure to account for some

909
00:59:05,711 --> 00:59:08,710
phenomenon. And the key point is that
if your theory is a slight bit off,

910
00:59:08,711 --> 00:59:09,940
it won't agree with experiment,

911
00:59:10,150 --> 00:59:12,670
but it doesn't mean that the
theory is actually wrong.

912
00:59:13,480 --> 00:59:18,010
But direct could as easily have been
talking about his own equation in which he

913
00:59:18,011 --> 00:59:20,930
predicted that the electrons
should have an anti.

914
00:59:22,010 --> 00:59:25,580
And since the only positively charged
particle that was known at the time was

915
00:59:25,581 --> 00:59:29,210
the Proton Heisenberg pointed out, well
it shouldn't, you're anti particle,

916
00:59:29,450 --> 00:59:31,670
the Proton have the same
mass as the electronic.

917
00:59:31,670 --> 00:59:33,140
Doesn't that invalidate your theory?

918
00:59:33,530 --> 00:59:37,680
So I think the direct was actually being
quite potentially quite sneaky. Um,

919
00:59:37,760 --> 00:59:38,510
and uh,

920
00:59:38,510 --> 00:59:41,630
talking about the fact that he had been
pushed off of his own theory to some

921
00:59:41,631 --> 00:59:44,360
extent by Heisenberg. Um, but look,

922
00:59:44,740 --> 00:59:49,740
we fetishize the scientific method
and popper and falsification,

923
00:59:50,690 --> 00:59:55,610
um, because it protects us from
crazy ideas entering the field. So,

924
00:59:55,611 --> 00:59:55,971
you know,

925
00:59:55,971 --> 00:59:59,090
it's a question of balancing type one
and type two error and we're pretty,

926
00:59:59,091 --> 01:00:02,990
we were pretty maxed out in one
direction. The opposite of that. The,

927
01:00:02,991 --> 01:00:07,540
let me say what comforts me sort
of biology or engineering, uh,

928
01:00:07,670 --> 01:00:11,000
at the end of the day does the thing work?
Yeah.

929
01:00:11,480 --> 01:00:15,950
You can not test the crazies
away. The crazy eight. We'll see.

930
01:00:15,980 --> 01:00:16,670
Now you're saying,

931
01:00:16,670 --> 01:00:21,140
but some ideas actually crazy and
some are are actually correct. So,

932
01:00:21,230 --> 01:00:25,720
well there's pre correct. Currently
crazy. Yeah. Right. And so you,

933
01:00:25,721 --> 01:00:30,620
you don't want to get rid of
everybody who's pre correct.
And currently crazy. Um,

934
01:00:31,430 --> 01:00:32,161
the problem is,

935
01:00:32,161 --> 01:00:37,161
is that we don't have standards in general
for trying to determine who has to be

936
01:00:37,821 --> 01:00:42,620
put to the sword in terms of their
career and who has to be protected, uh,

937
01:00:43,220 --> 01:00:47,390
as some sort of giant time suck pain in
the ass, uh, who may change everything.

938
01:00:47,840 --> 01:00:51,380
Do you think that's possible? Uh,
creating a mechanism of those select well,

939
01:00:51,381 --> 01:00:54,320
you're not going to like the
answer, but here it comes. Boy,

940
01:00:55,130 --> 01:00:59,300
it has to do with very human elements.

941
01:00:59,330 --> 01:01:02,480
We're trying to do this at the
level of like rules and fairness.

942
01:01:02,481 --> 01:01:07,481
It's not going to work because the only
thing that really understands this,

943
01:01:09,950 --> 01:01:14,080
you're read the read the
double helix. It's a book. Oh,

944
01:01:14,150 --> 01:01:17,390
you have to read this book.
Not only did Jim Watson,

945
01:01:17,570 --> 01:01:21,140
uh ha half discover this
three dimensional structure.

946
01:01:21,141 --> 01:01:26,141
DNA is also one hell of a writer
before he became an ass that no,

947
01:01:26,871 --> 01:01:30,540
he, yeah, he's tried to destroy his own
reputation and you bought the asset.

948
01:01:30,550 --> 01:01:31,670
Didn't know about the good writer.

949
01:01:32,900 --> 01:01:37,250
Jim Watson is one of the most
important people now living. And, uh,

950
01:01:37,610 --> 01:01:38,840
as I've said before,

951
01:01:38,870 --> 01:01:43,700
Jim Watson is too important a
legacy to be left to Jim Watson. Um,

952
01:01:44,650 --> 01:01:48,650
that book tells you more about
what actually moves the dial.

953
01:01:49,230 --> 01:01:52,670
And there's another story about him,
which I don't, I don't agree with,

954
01:01:52,671 --> 01:01:55,300
which is that he stole everything
from Rosalind Franklin. I mean, the,

955
01:01:55,310 --> 01:01:57,860
the problems that he had with
Rosalind Franklin are real,

956
01:01:58,160 --> 01:02:03,050
but we should actually honor that
tension in our history by delving into it

957
01:02:03,051 --> 01:02:04,760
rather than having a simple solution.

958
01:02:05,120 --> 01:02:09,230
Jim Watson talks about Francis
Crick being a pain in the ass,

959
01:02:09,231 --> 01:02:14,231
that everybody is secretly knew it was
super brilliant and there's an encounter

960
01:02:14,421 --> 01:02:16,640
between a charge f,
uh,

961
01:02:16,710 --> 01:02:21,450
who came up with the equimolar relations
between the nucleotides who should have

962
01:02:21,451 --> 01:02:23,940
gotten the structure of
DNA and Watson and Crick.

963
01:02:24,630 --> 01:02:26,940
And you know,

964
01:02:26,941 --> 01:02:30,270
he's talks about missing a shiver
in the heartbeat of biology.

965
01:02:30,270 --> 01:02:34,440
And this stuff is so gorgeous and just
makes you tremble even thinking about it.

966
01:02:34,590 --> 01:02:36,570
Um,
look,

967
01:02:37,200 --> 01:02:42,200
we know very often who is to be feared
and we need to fund the people that we

968
01:02:43,201 --> 01:02:44,034
fear.

969
01:02:45,090 --> 01:02:49,200
The people who are wasting our time need
to be excluded from the conversation

970
01:02:49,650 --> 01:02:54,030
you see. And you know, maybe we'll
make some errors in both directions,

971
01:02:54,810 --> 01:02:58,080
but we have known our own people.

972
01:02:58,110 --> 01:03:00,570
We know the pains in the
asses that might work out.

973
01:03:01,020 --> 01:03:04,470
And we know that people who are really
just blow hards are really have very

974
01:03:04,471 --> 01:03:08,220
little to contribute. Most
of the time. It's not 100%,

975
01:03:08,221 --> 01:03:09,900
but you're not going to
get there with rules.

976
01:03:10,430 --> 01:03:14,230
Right? It's a using some kind of
instinct. I mean, I, to be honest,

977
01:03:14,530 --> 01:03:17,170
I'm going to make you roll
your eyes for a second. But uh,

978
01:03:18,330 --> 01:03:21,520
and the first time I heard that there is
a large community of people who believe

979
01:03:21,521 --> 01:03:22,510
the earth is flat.

980
01:03:23,370 --> 01:03:23,680
Okay.

981
01:03:23,680 --> 01:03:26,350
Actually made me pause and
ask myself the question,

982
01:03:26,420 --> 01:03:30,100
why would there be such a community?
Yeah. Is it possible the earth is flat?

983
01:03:30,160 --> 01:03:33,580
So I had to like, wait a minute. I mean,

984
01:03:33,610 --> 01:03:37,150
then you go through a thinking process
that I think is really healthy. Uh,

985
01:03:37,470 --> 01:03:41,530
it ultimately ends up being a geometry
thing. I think. Uh, it's an interesting,

986
01:03:41,560 --> 01:03:43,690
it's an interesting thought
experiment at the very least.

987
01:03:44,100 --> 01:03:48,870
Well I do a different version of it. I
say, why is this community stable? Yeah,

988
01:03:48,930 --> 01:03:50,640
that's a good a way to analyze it.

989
01:03:50,810 --> 01:03:54,720
What interesting that whatever we've
done has not erased the community.

990
01:03:55,890 --> 01:03:59,130
So you know, they're taking a long
shot bet that won't pan out. You know,

991
01:04:00,220 --> 01:04:03,280
maybe we just haven't thought enough about
the rationality of the square root of

992
01:04:03,281 --> 01:04:05,170
two and somebody's brilliant,
we'll figure it out.

993
01:04:05,171 --> 01:04:08,710
Maybe we will eventually land one day on
the surface of Jupiter and explore it.

994
01:04:10,960 --> 01:04:12,970
Right. These are crazy
things that will never happen

995
01:04:14,030 --> 01:04:17,540
so much as social media
operates by Ai Algorithms.

996
01:04:17,541 --> 01:04:21,440
He's talked about this a little bit,
uh, recommending the content you see.

997
01:04:21,710 --> 01:04:24,920
So on this idea of radical thought,

998
01:04:24,980 --> 01:04:29,630
how much should AI show you things you
disagree with on Twitter and so on,

999
01:04:30,740 --> 01:04:35,220
in, in a Twitter war verse in the
departments in this quest? Yeah. Yeah.

1000
01:04:36,210 --> 01:04:39,480
Cause you don't know the answer.
No, no, no, no. Look, we've been,

1001
01:04:39,860 --> 01:04:44,860
they've pushed out this cognitive Lego
to us that will just lead to madness.

1002
01:04:45,780 --> 01:04:50,370
It's good to be challenged with things
that you disagree with. The answer is no.

1003
01:04:50,490 --> 01:04:53,970
It's good to be challenged
with interesting things
with which you currently

1004
01:04:53,971 --> 01:04:56,490
disagree.
But that might be true.

1005
01:04:56,850 --> 01:05:00,000
So I don't really care about whether or
not I disagree with something or don't

1006
01:05:00,001 --> 01:05:00,361
disagree.

1007
01:05:00,361 --> 01:05:04,350
I need to know why that particular
disagreeable thing is being pushed out.

1008
01:05:05,350 --> 01:05:09,670
Is it because it's likely to be true?
Is it because, is there some reason?

1009
01:05:09,700 --> 01:05:12,910
Because I can write, I can
write a computer generator, uh,

1010
01:05:13,480 --> 01:05:16,660
to come up with an infinite number of
disagreeable statements that nobody needs

1011
01:05:16,661 --> 01:05:21,550
to look. So please, before you push
things at me that w or disagreeable,

1012
01:05:21,551 --> 01:05:25,210
tell me why there is an aspect in
which that question is, is quite dumb,

1013
01:05:25,211 --> 01:05:29,340
especially because it's being
used to, uh, almost, um,

1014
01:05:30,280 --> 01:05:34,060
uh, very generically by these
different networks to say, well,

1015
01:05:34,061 --> 01:05:37,780
we're trying to work this out.
But you know, basically, uh,

1016
01:05:37,960 --> 01:05:42,960
how much do you see the value
of seeing things you don't like,

1017
01:05:43,540 --> 01:05:46,930
not you disagree with because very
difficult to know exactly what you

1018
01:05:46,931 --> 01:05:47,591
articulated,

1019
01:05:47,591 --> 01:05:52,591
which is the stuff that's important for
you to consider that you disagree with

1020
01:05:53,311 --> 01:05:54,610
it.
That's really hard to figure out.

1021
01:05:54,940 --> 01:05:56,920
The bottom line is this
stuff you don't like.

1022
01:05:57,130 --> 01:06:01,400
If you are a Hillary Clinton supporter,
you may not want to,

1023
01:06:02,060 --> 01:06:05,410
it might not make you feel good to
see anything about Donald Trump.

1024
01:06:05,800 --> 01:06:08,470
That's the only thing algorithms
can really optimize for currently.

1025
01:06:08,930 --> 01:06:11,710
It really nothing they can do better.
This is where we're, we're thinking.

1026
01:06:11,711 --> 01:06:16,711
So now we're engaged in some more ronic
back and forth where I have no idea why

1027
01:06:21,191 --> 01:06:25,060
people who are capable of building
Google, Facebook, Twitter,

1028
01:06:25,960 --> 01:06:28,870
or having us in these incredibly
low level discussions,

1029
01:06:28,871 --> 01:06:30,430
do they not know any smart people?

1030
01:06:31,180 --> 01:06:34,780
Do they not have the phone numbers of
people who can elevate these discussions?

1031
01:06:36,040 --> 01:06:40,300
They do. But this awesome
idea for a different thing.

1032
01:06:40,301 --> 01:06:42,800
And they're pushing those people
out of those rumors there.

1033
01:06:43,480 --> 01:06:48,400
They're optimizing for things we
can't see. And yes, profit is there.

1034
01:06:48,460 --> 01:06:49,990
No. But it, nobody's questioning that.

1035
01:06:50,230 --> 01:06:55,230
But they're also optimizing for things
like political control or the fact that

1036
01:06:55,811 --> 01:06:59,170
they're doing business in Pakistan and
so they don't want to talk about all the

1037
01:06:59,171 --> 01:07:03,940
things that they're going to be
bending to in Pakistan. So we're,

1038
01:07:04,260 --> 01:07:06,970
we're involved in a fake discussion.

1039
01:07:07,360 --> 01:07:09,760
You think so you think these
conversations at that depth,

1040
01:07:09,761 --> 01:07:11,020
they're happening inside Google.

1041
01:07:11,230 --> 01:07:15,520
You don't think they have some basic
metrics under user engagements.

1042
01:07:15,700 --> 01:07:17,980
You're having a fake
conversation with us guys.

1043
01:07:18,190 --> 01:07:19,870
We know you're having a fake conversation.

1044
01:07:19,900 --> 01:07:22,150
I do not wish to be part
of your fake conversation.

1045
01:07:23,560 --> 01:07:28,150
You know how to cool these units.
You know, high availability,

1046
01:07:28,180 --> 01:07:32,710
like nobody's business.
My Gmail never goes down almost.

1047
01:07:33,130 --> 01:07:37,210
So you think just because they can do
incredible work on the software side with

1048
01:07:37,211 --> 01:07:38,050
infrastructure,

1049
01:07:38,260 --> 01:07:43,260
they can also deal with some of these
difficult questions about human behavior,

1050
01:07:44,951 --> 01:07:48,720
human understanding. You're
not, I mean I've seen the,

1051
01:07:48,820 --> 01:07:53,820
I've seen the developer's screens that
people take shots of inside of Google.

1052
01:07:54,190 --> 01:07:59,110
Yeah. And I've heard stories inside
of Facebook and apple. We're not,

1053
01:07:59,620 --> 01:08:03,640
we're engaged. They're engaging
us in the wrong conversations.

1054
01:08:04,030 --> 01:08:07,600
We're not at this low level.
Here's one of my favorite questions.

1055
01:08:08,080 --> 01:08:12,310
Why is every piece of hardware
that I purchased in, in,

1056
01:08:12,311 --> 01:08:17,120
in tech space equipped as a listening,
we're,

1057
01:08:17,150 --> 01:08:19,730
where's my physical
shutter to cover my lens?

1058
01:08:19,731 --> 01:08:24,710
We had this in the 1970s it cameras
that had blends caps, you know,

1059
01:08:25,040 --> 01:08:29,210
how much would it cost to have a
security model pay five extra bucks.

1060
01:08:29,750 --> 01:08:34,580
Why is my indicator light software
controlled? Why when my camera is on,

1061
01:08:34,581 --> 01:08:38,630
do I not see that the light is on by
putting it as a something that cannot be

1062
01:08:38,631 --> 01:08:40,760
bypassed,
why have you set up my,

1063
01:08:40,761 --> 01:08:45,761
all of my devices at some difficulty to
yourselves as listening devices and we

1064
01:08:46,521 --> 01:08:50,630
don't even talk about this,
this, this, this, this thing
is total fucking bullshit.

1065
01:08:51,390 --> 01:08:55,280
Well, I, these discussions
are happening about privacy.

1066
01:08:55,281 --> 01:08:58,100
This is there a dif more difficult than
you'd give them. It's not just privacy,

1067
01:08:59,030 --> 01:09:02,960
it's about social control.
We're talking about social control.

1068
01:09:03,530 --> 01:09:06,230
Why do I not have controls
over my own levers?

1069
01:09:07,100 --> 01:09:09,950
Just have a really cute
UI where I can switch.

1070
01:09:09,951 --> 01:09:12,920
I can dial things where I can at
least see what the algorithms are.

1071
01:09:13,200 --> 01:09:17,210
You think that there is some
deliberate choices being made?

1072
01:09:17,211 --> 01:09:21,440
Here is emergence and
there is a intention.

1073
01:09:21,530 --> 01:09:25,940
There's two dimensions. The vector
does not collapse onto either access,

1074
01:09:26,300 --> 01:09:31,300
but the idea that anybody who suggests
that intention is completely absent is a

1075
01:09:32,961 --> 01:09:36,620
child that's really
beautifully put and uh,

1076
01:09:36,680 --> 01:09:39,250
like many things you've said is
going to make me, can I trust,

1077
01:09:39,380 --> 01:09:41,090
can I turn this around slightly?
Yeah.

1078
01:09:41,780 --> 01:09:44,880
I sit down with you and you say that
you're obsessed with my feet. [inaudible]

1079
01:09:45,710 --> 01:09:48,920
I didn't even know what my feed is.
What are you seeing that I'm not,

1080
01:09:49,680 --> 01:09:50,690
I was obsessive Lee,

1081
01:09:50,691 --> 01:09:55,220
looking through your feed a on Twitter
because it was really enjoyable because

1082
01:09:55,221 --> 01:09:58,490
it was the Tom Layer element.
Does the humor in it. By the way,

1083
01:09:58,491 --> 01:10:03,110
that feed is Eric r Weinstein on
Twitter at Greg. Eric r Weinstein.

1084
01:10:03,710 --> 01:10:05,750
It. No, seriously. Why?

1085
01:10:06,590 --> 01:10:10,120
Why did I find it enjoyable or
what it was I seeing? What are you,

1086
01:10:10,121 --> 01:10:14,150
what are you looking for? Why are we
doing this? What does this podcast about?

1087
01:10:14,780 --> 01:10:16,430
I know you've got all
these interesting people.

1088
01:10:16,460 --> 01:10:21,310
I'm just some guy who is sort of
a podcast guest sort of access.

1089
01:10:21,320 --> 01:10:24,560
You're not even wearing a tie. I mean,
not even wearing I on a serious interview,

1090
01:10:24,940 --> 01:10:27,580
uh,
uh,

1091
01:10:27,800 --> 01:10:32,420
searching for meaning for happiness,
for a dopamine rush.

1092
01:10:32,421 --> 01:10:36,300
So short term and long term. And how are
you finding your way to me? What it, what,

1093
01:10:36,301 --> 01:10:40,370
what, what is I, I don't honestly
know what I'm doing to reach you.

1094
01:10:41,210 --> 01:10:43,790
The representing ideas,

1095
01:10:44,060 --> 01:10:47,870
which are feel common sense to me
and not many people are speaking.

1096
01:10:47,871 --> 01:10:52,240
So it's Kinda like the dog, the
intellectual dark web folks, right?

1097
01:10:52,610 --> 01:10:56,660
Uh,
they s these folks from Sam Harris,

1098
01:10:56,661 --> 01:11:00,350
the Jordan Peterson to yourself
are saying things where it's like,

1099
01:11:00,351 --> 01:11:03,290
you're like saying, look, there's an
elephant and he's not wearing any clothes.

1100
01:11:05,240 --> 01:11:09,350
And I say, yeah, yeah. Well let's
have more of that conversation.

1101
01:11:09,380 --> 01:11:12,920
That's how I'm finding you.
I'm desperate to try to,

1102
01:11:13,320 --> 01:11:17,130
the conversation we're having, I'm very
worried. We've got an election in 2020.

1103
01:11:17,400 --> 01:11:22,230
I don't think we can afford four more
years of a misinterpreted message.

1104
01:11:22,830 --> 01:11:25,200
Um,
which is what Donald Trump was.

1105
01:11:25,320 --> 01:11:28,350
And I don't want the
destruction of our institutions.

1106
01:11:28,351 --> 01:11:30,600
They all seem hell bent
on destroying themselves.

1107
01:11:30,630 --> 01:11:33,180
So I'm trying to save theoretical physics.

1108
01:11:33,181 --> 01:11:38,160
Trying to save the New York Times is
trying to save are various processes.

1109
01:11:38,161 --> 01:11:41,210
And I think it feels
delusional to me that, uh,

1110
01:11:41,510 --> 01:11:45,870
cause this is falling to a tiny group
of people who are willing to speak out

1111
01:11:45,871 --> 01:11:49,920
without getting so freaked out
that everything they say it will be

1112
01:11:49,921 --> 01:11:53,160
misinterpreted and that their lives will
be ruined through the process. I mean,

1113
01:11:53,161 --> 01:11:57,450
I think we're in an absolutely bananas
period of time and I don't believe it

1114
01:11:57,451 --> 01:12:00,990
should fall to such a tiny number of,
of shoulders to shoulder this weight.

1115
01:12:02,340 --> 01:12:03,050
So

1116
01:12:03,050 --> 01:12:05,450
I have to ask you on a capitalism side,

1117
01:12:05,840 --> 01:12:09,770
you mentioned that technology's killing
capitalism. It has effects that are

1118
01:12:11,270 --> 01:12:13,540
unintended, well, not unintended, but, uh,

1119
01:12:13,610 --> 01:12:18,550
not what economists would predict
or speak of capitalism creating. Uh,

1120
01:12:18,770 --> 01:12:20,690
I just want to talk to
you about in general,

1121
01:12:21,260 --> 01:12:25,070
the effect of even then artificial
intelligence or technology automation,

1122
01:12:25,130 --> 01:12:30,130
taking away jobs in these kinds of
things in what you think is the way to

1123
01:12:30,351 --> 01:12:31,220
alleviate that,

1124
01:12:31,490 --> 01:12:35,810
whether the Andrew Ang presidential
candidate with universal basic income ubi.

1125
01:12:35,990 --> 01:12:38,450
What are your thoughts there?

1126
01:12:38,630 --> 01:12:42,560
How do we fight off the negative
effects of technology? That all right.

1127
01:12:42,810 --> 01:12:43,980
Software Guy, right? Yup.

1128
01:12:44,550 --> 01:12:49,040
A human being is a worker is an old idea.
Yes.

1129
01:12:49,450 --> 01:12:53,880
Human being has a worker is a
different object, right? Yeah.

1130
01:12:53,910 --> 01:12:56,510
So if you think about object
oriented programming is a paradigm.

1131
01:12:57,570 --> 01:13:01,350
A human being has a worker
and a human being has a soul.

1132
01:13:01,830 --> 01:13:04,290
We're talking about the fact
that for a period of time,

1133
01:13:04,350 --> 01:13:07,380
the worker that a human being has yeah.

1134
01:13:07,560 --> 01:13:11,160
Was in a position to feed the
soul that a human being has.

1135
01:13:12,210 --> 01:13:16,860
However, we have two separate
claims on the value in society.

1136
01:13:17,970 --> 01:13:22,560
One is as a worker and the other is as
a soul and the soul needs sustenance.

1137
01:13:22,561 --> 01:13:27,010
It needs dignity. It needs
meaning. It needs purpose. Okay.

1138
01:13:27,370 --> 01:13:32,370
As long as you're means of
support is not highly repetitive.

1139
01:13:33,560 --> 01:13:36,020
I think you have a while to go
before you need to start worrying.

1140
01:13:36,890 --> 01:13:41,210
But if what you do is highly repetitive
and it's not terribly generative,

1141
01:13:41,211 --> 01:13:45,050
you weren't in the cross hairs of
four for loops and while loops,

1142
01:13:45,980 --> 01:13:48,830
and that's what computers
excel at repetitive behavior.

1143
01:13:48,830 --> 01:13:51,610
And when I say repetitive,
I mean meat.

1144
01:13:51,740 --> 01:13:54,200
I may mean things that have never
happened be through common tutorial

1145
01:13:54,201 --> 01:13:57,200
possibilities. But as long as it
has a looped characteristic to it,

1146
01:13:57,201 --> 01:13:58,034
you're in trouble.

1147
01:13:58,930 --> 01:14:03,930
We are seeing a massive push towards
socialism because capitalists are slow to

1148
01:14:06,731 --> 01:14:10,820
address the fact that a worker
may not be able to make claims.

1149
01:14:10,900 --> 01:14:15,900
A relatively undistinguished median member
of our society is still has needs to

1150
01:14:16,811 --> 01:14:20,710
reproduce,
needs to ha to dignity.

1151
01:14:20,740 --> 01:14:25,740
And when capitalism abandons the
median individual or you know,

1152
01:14:26,431 --> 01:14:29,530
the, the bottom 10th or
whatever it, it's going to do,

1153
01:14:30,520 --> 01:14:32,320
it's flirting with revolution.

1154
01:14:32,620 --> 01:14:37,180
And what concerns me is
that the capitalists aren't
sufficiently capitalistic to

1155
01:14:37,181 --> 01:14:38,014
understand this.

1156
01:14:39,280 --> 01:14:44,230
You really want to court a authoritarian
control in our society because you

1157
01:14:44,231 --> 01:14:48,120
can't see that people may not be able
to defend themselves in the marketplace

1158
01:14:48,130 --> 01:14:53,130
because the marginal product of their
labor w two s to low to feed their dignity

1159
01:14:53,591 --> 01:14:55,420
as a soul.
So it,

1160
01:14:55,540 --> 01:15:00,540
my great concern is that our free society
has to do with the fact that we are

1161
01:15:00,791 --> 01:15:01,780
self organized.

1162
01:15:02,320 --> 01:15:05,860
I remember looking down from my office
in Manhattan when Lehman Brothers

1163
01:15:05,861 --> 01:15:07,030
collapsed and thinking,

1164
01:15:07,900 --> 01:15:12,070
who's going to tell all these people that
they need to show up at work when they

1165
01:15:12,071 --> 01:15:16,270
don't have a financial system to
incentivize them to show up at work.

1166
01:15:17,380 --> 01:15:19,870
So my complaint is first of all,

1167
01:15:19,871 --> 01:15:21,970
not with the Socialists
but with the capitalists,

1168
01:15:22,000 --> 01:15:24,010
which is you guys are being idiots.

1169
01:15:24,490 --> 01:15:29,490
You're courting revolution by continuing
to harp on the same old ideas that

1170
01:15:30,310 --> 01:15:33,220
well, you know, try, try harder.
Bootstrap yourself. Yeah,

1171
01:15:33,221 --> 01:15:35,290
to an extent that works to an extent,

1172
01:15:36,280 --> 01:15:39,790
but we are clearly headed in place that
there's nothing that ties together our

1173
01:15:39,791 --> 01:15:44,791
need to contribute and
our need to consume.

1174
01:15:45,430 --> 01:15:48,970
And that may not be provided by capitalism
because it may have been a temporary

1175
01:15:48,971 --> 01:15:49,420
phenomena.

1176
01:15:49,420 --> 01:15:54,420
So check out my article on anthropic
capitalism and the new gimmick economy.

1177
01:15:55,030 --> 01:15:55,451
Uh,

1178
01:15:55,451 --> 01:15:59,560
I think people are late getting the wake
up call and we would be doing a better

1179
01:15:59,561 --> 01:16:02,750
job saving capitalism from itself.
Um,

1180
01:16:02,860 --> 01:16:05,740
because I don't want this done
under authoritarian control.

1181
01:16:05,741 --> 01:16:07,510
And the more we insist that,
uh,

1182
01:16:07,570 --> 01:16:12,010
everybody who's not thriving in our
society during their reproductive years in

1183
01:16:12,011 --> 01:16:16,330
order to have a family is failing
at a personal level. I mean,

1184
01:16:16,331 --> 01:16:20,300
what a disgusting thing that we're saying.
What a, what a horrible message. Who To,

1185
01:16:20,310 --> 01:16:24,670
who the hell have we become that we've
so bought into the Chicago model, um,

1186
01:16:24,940 --> 01:16:28,570
that we can't see the humanity that we're
destroying in that process. And it's,

1187
01:16:28,990 --> 01:16:32,070
I hate, I hate the thought
of communism. I really do.

1188
01:16:32,090 --> 01:16:35,920
My family has flirted with it
decades past. It's a wrong, bad idea,

1189
01:16:36,460 --> 01:16:40,750
but we are going to need to figure out
how to make sure that those souls are

1190
01:16:40,751 --> 01:16:45,010
nourished, nourished, and respected
and capitalism better have an answer.

1191
01:16:45,040 --> 01:16:47,200
And I'm betting on capitalism,
but I gotta tell you,

1192
01:16:47,201 --> 01:16:52,000
I'm pretty disappointed with my team.
So you're still on the capitalism team.

1193
01:16:52,210 --> 01:16:57,090
Just a, there's a theme here. Restful,
radical capitalism. Capitalism.

1194
01:16:57,091 --> 01:16:57,970
Yeah.
I want,

1195
01:16:58,000 --> 01:17:01,990
I think hyper capitalism is going to have
to be cup coupled to hyper socialism.

1196
01:17:01,991 --> 01:17:06,460
You need to allow the most productive
people to create wonders and you've got to

1197
01:17:06,461 --> 01:17:11,210
stop bogging them down with all of
these extra nice requirements, you know,

1198
01:17:11,240 --> 01:17:14,900
nicest dead good. Has a future. Nice.

1199
01:17:14,901 --> 01:17:18,830
Doesn't have a future because nice
ends up with, with Goulet eggs.

1200
01:17:19,820 --> 01:17:24,230
Damn, that's a good line. Okay,
last question. You a tweeted today,

1201
01:17:24,950 --> 01:17:25,671
a simple,

1202
01:17:25,671 --> 01:17:30,671
quite insightful equation saying
a imagine that every unit f,

1203
01:17:31,010 --> 01:17:35,000
uh, fame you picked up
as stalkers and h haters.

1204
01:17:35,630 --> 01:17:39,020
So I imagine acid h are dependent
on your path to fame, perhaps.

1205
01:17:39,370 --> 01:17:39,710
Well,

1206
01:17:39,710 --> 01:17:42,750
it's not as simple and people always
take these things literally when you have

1207
01:17:42,751 --> 01:17:44,790
like 280 characters to explain yourself

1208
01:17:46,880 --> 01:17:51,510
as emia there. That's not a
mathematical, uh, no, there's
no law. Oh, okay. All right.

1209
01:17:51,511 --> 01:17:53,340
I just said,
why I put the word imagine,

1210
01:17:53,341 --> 01:17:56,330
because I haven't slept
with mathematicians.
Desire for precision. Yeah.

1211
01:17:56,360 --> 01:17:57,480
Imagine that this were true,

1212
01:17:57,810 --> 01:18:01,950
but it was a beautiful way to imagine
that there is a law that has those

1213
01:18:01,951 --> 01:18:06,480
variables in it. And uh, you've
become quite famous these days.

1214
01:18:06,690 --> 01:18:11,690
So how do you yourself optimize that
equation with the peculiar kind of fame

1215
01:18:11,851 --> 01:18:13,650
that you have gathered along the way?

1216
01:18:13,750 --> 01:18:17,350
I want to be kinder. I want to be kinder
to myself. I want to be kinder to others.

1217
01:18:17,351 --> 01:18:19,030
I want to be able to have heart

1218
01:18:22,110 --> 01:18:27,070
compassionate. These things
are really important. And
uh, I have a pretty spectrum.

1219
01:18:27,071 --> 01:18:29,900
He kind of approach to analysis.
I'm quite literal.

1220
01:18:30,470 --> 01:18:34,630
I can go full rain man on you at any
given moment. No. I can, yeah. Can, uh,

1221
01:18:34,640 --> 01:18:36,440
it's faculty to have autism if you like.

1222
01:18:36,441 --> 01:18:40,010
And people are gonna get angry because
they want autism to be respected. But yes,

1223
01:18:41,020 --> 01:18:45,590
when you see me coding or you
see me doing mathematics, I am,

1224
01:18:45,950 --> 01:18:50,440
you know, I speak with speech apnea
me right down to dinner, you know?

1225
01:18:51,290 --> 01:18:55,980
Yeah. We have to try to integrate
ourselves. And those tensions between,

1226
01:18:56,930 --> 01:19:00,230
you know, it's sort of back to the
US as a worker and us as a soul.

1227
01:19:00,620 --> 01:19:05,390
Many of us are optimizing one to the,
at the expense of the other.

1228
01:19:05,540 --> 01:19:09,890
And I struggle with social media and
I struggle with people making threats

1229
01:19:09,891 --> 01:19:13,990
against, uh, our families.
And I struggle with, um,

1230
01:19:14,030 --> 01:19:15,830
just how much pain people are in.

1231
01:19:15,860 --> 01:19:19,700
And if there's one message I
would like to push out there, um,

1232
01:19:20,010 --> 01:19:23,420
irresponsible. Everybody,
all of us, myself included,

1233
01:19:23,690 --> 01:19:26,620
with struggling struggle,
struggle mightily because you,

1234
01:19:27,470 --> 01:19:31,610
it's nobody else's job to do your
struggle for you. Now with that said,

1235
01:19:31,611 --> 01:19:34,820
if you're struggling and you're trying
and you're trying to figure out how to

1236
01:19:34,821 --> 01:19:38,090
better yourself and where you failed and
where you've let down and your family,

1237
01:19:38,091 --> 01:19:40,640
your friends,
your worker is all this kind of stuff,

1238
01:19:42,110 --> 01:19:46,100
give yourself a break. You know,
if, if, if it's not working out,

1239
01:19:46,130 --> 01:19:49,820
I have a lifelong relationship
with failure and success.

1240
01:19:50,270 --> 01:19:51,920
There's been no period of my life.

1241
01:19:52,720 --> 01:19:57,110
We're both haven't been present
in one form or another. And I,

1242
01:19:57,130 --> 01:20:00,890
I do wish to say that a lot of times
people think this is glamorous.

1243
01:20:01,190 --> 01:20:03,320
I'm about to go do a show with Sam Harris.

1244
01:20:04,390 --> 01:20:06,850
People are going to listen in on
two guys having a conversation on.

1245
01:20:07,260 --> 01:20:10,080
It's completely crazy when I'm always
trying to figure out how to make sure that

1246
01:20:10,081 --> 01:20:15,060
those people get maximum value. And, uh,
and that's why I'm doing this podcast.

1247
01:20:15,061 --> 01:20:19,110
You know, just give yourself
a break. You owe us,

1248
01:20:19,350 --> 01:20:20,490
you owe us your struggle.

1249
01:20:20,491 --> 01:20:24,540
You don't owe your family or your
coworkers or your lovers or your family

1250
01:20:24,541 --> 01:20:29,340
members' success. Um, as long as you're
in there and you're picking yourself up,

1251
01:20:29,640 --> 01:20:30,960
recognize that this,

1252
01:20:31,260 --> 01:20:35,730
this new situation with the economy that
doesn't have the juice to sustain our

1253
01:20:35,731 --> 01:20:39,930
institutions has caused the people
who have risen to the top of those

1254
01:20:39,931 --> 01:20:42,510
institutions to get
quite brutal and cruel.

1255
01:20:43,350 --> 01:20:47,610
Everybody's lying at the moment.
Nobody's really a truth teller. Um,

1256
01:20:48,450 --> 01:20:52,770
try to keep your humanity about you.
Try to recognize that if you're failing,

1257
01:20:52,771 --> 01:20:56,070
if things aren't where you want them
to be and you're struggling and you're

1258
01:20:56,071 --> 01:20:57,990
trying to figure out what you're
doing wrong, which you could do,

1259
01:20:58,410 --> 01:21:02,940
it's not necessarily all your fault.
We are in a global situation.

1260
01:21:02,970 --> 01:21:07,950
I have not met the people who are
honest, kind, good, successful.

1261
01:21:08,220 --> 01:21:12,470
Nobody that I've met is chick
is checking all the boxes. Uh,

1262
01:21:12,720 --> 01:21:14,010
nobody's getting all tens.

1263
01:21:14,370 --> 01:21:18,720
So I just think that's
an important message that
doesn't get pushed out enough.

1264
01:21:18,750 --> 01:21:22,890
Either. People want to hold society
responsible for their failures,

1265
01:21:23,040 --> 01:21:25,810
which is not reasonable. You have
to struggle. You have to try, uh,

1266
01:21:26,130 --> 01:21:28,890
or they want to say you're 100%
responsible for your failures,

1267
01:21:28,891 --> 01:21:33,180
which is total nonsense.
Beautifully put. Eric,

1268
01:21:33,181 --> 01:21:35,220
thanks so much for talking today.
Thanks for having me, buddy.
