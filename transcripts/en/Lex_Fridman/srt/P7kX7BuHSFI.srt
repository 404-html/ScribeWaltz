00:00:00,340 --> 00:00:02,320
Welcome back to success zero,
nine,

2
00:00:02,321 --> 00:00:06,640
nine artificial general intelligence.
Today we have Stephen Wolfe from.

3
00:00:07,940 --> 00:00:12,940
Thank you.

4
00:00:13,870 --> 00:00:15,520
That's the first.
I didn't even get started.

5
00:00:15,521 --> 00:00:17,890
You already clapping,
uh,

6
00:00:17,891 --> 00:00:22,891
in his book and you kind of.
Sciencey has explored and reveal the 

7
00:00:22,891 --> 00:00:26,401
power,
beauty and complexity of cellular 

8
00:00:26,401 --> 00:00:27,140
Automata as simple computational 
systems,

9
00:00:27,141 --> 00:00:29,220
which incredible complexity it can 
emerge.

10
00:00:30,180 --> 00:00:35,180
It's actually one of the books that 
really inspired me to get into 

11
00:00:35,180 --> 00:00:37,791
artificial intelligence.
He's created the Wolfram Alpha 

12
00:00:37,791 --> 00:00:40,581
competition knowledge engine created 
Mathematica that has now expanded to 

13
00:00:40,581 --> 00:00:44,511
become wolfram language.
Both he and his son were involved in 

14
00:00:44,511 --> 00:00:46,890
helping analyze,
create the alien language from the movie

15
00:00:46,891 --> 00:00:49,800
arrival of which they used the Wolfram 
language.

16
00:00:50,040 --> 00:00:53,010
Please again,
give Steven a warm welcome.

17
00:00:53,290 --> 00:00:58,100
Thanks so much.
The

18
00:00:58,150 --> 00:01:01,540
brief here is to talk about how 
artificial general intelligence is going

19
00:01:01,541 --> 00:01:03,430
to be achieved.
Is that the set,

20
00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:05,160
the basic picture?
So I,

21
00:01:05,161 --> 00:01:07,610
I,
maybe I'm reminded of kind of a storage.

22
00:01:07,660 --> 00:01:09,280
I don't think I've ever told them 
public,

23
00:01:09,281 --> 00:01:14,281
but um,
that something that happened just a few 

24
00:01:14,281 --> 00:01:16,750
buildings over from here.
So this was 2009 and Wolfram Alpha was,

25
00:01:16,780 --> 00:01:21,780
was about to arrive on the scene.
I assume most of you have used wolf now 

26
00:01:21,780 --> 00:01:23,200
for a cmo of Alpha.
Yes.

27
00:01:23,710 --> 00:01:26,470
The pump.
How many of you have used Wolf Malfa?

28
00:01:27,550 --> 00:01:28,300
Okay,
that's good.

29
00:01:29,790 --> 00:01:34,790
Um,
so I had long been a friend of Marvin 

30
00:01:34,790 --> 00:01:39,180
Minsky and Marvin was a sort of pioneer 
of the ai world and I kind of seen for 

31
00:01:40,511 --> 00:01:41,660
years,
you know,

32
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:44,050
question answering systems that tried 
to,

33
00:01:44,470 --> 00:01:48,250
uh,
to sort of general intelligence question

34
00:01:48,251 --> 00:01:49,250
answering.
And so Marvin,

35
00:01:49,930 --> 00:01:53,240
and so I was going to show Marvin,
you know,

36
00:01:53,350 --> 00:01:55,180
Wolf Malfa,
he looks at it,

37
00:01:55,290 --> 00:01:55,930
he's like,
oh,

38
00:01:55,931 --> 00:01:56,980
okay,
that's fine.

39
00:01:57,640 --> 00:01:59,170
Whatever said no,
Marvin,

40
00:01:59,470 --> 00:02:03,940
this time it actually works.
You can try real questions.

41
00:02:03,941 --> 00:02:07,090
This is actually something useful.
This is not just a toy.

42
00:02:07,120 --> 00:02:09,190
And it was kind of interesting to see.
It took.

43
00:02:09,370 --> 00:02:14,370
It took about five minutes from Marvin 
to realize that this was finally a 

44
00:02:14,370 --> 00:02:17,791
question answering system that could 
actually answer questions that were 

45
00:02:17,791 --> 00:02:17,791
useful to people.
Um,

46
00:02:17,791 --> 00:02:19,630
and so one question is,
how do we,

47
00:02:19,631 --> 00:02:21,370
how do we achieve that?
So,

48
00:02:21,371 --> 00:02:26,371
you know,
you go to wealth Malfa and you can ask 

49
00:02:26,371 --> 00:02:26,371
it.
I mean,

50
00:02:26,371 --> 00:02:26,371
it's,
I don't know what we can ask it.

51
00:02:26,371 --> 00:02:26,530
I don't know.
What's the,

52
00:02:26,531 --> 00:02:27,660
um,
uh,

53
00:02:29,290 --> 00:02:34,290
some random question.
What does the population of Cambridge 

54
00:02:34,290 --> 00:02:34,800
actually,
here's a question divided by.

55
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:37,480
Let's try that.
What's the population of Cambridge?

56
00:02:37,481 --> 00:02:39,880
It's probably gonna figure out that we 
mean Cambridge,

57
00:02:39,881 --> 00:02:41,590
Massachusetts is going to give us some 
number.

58
00:02:41,591 --> 00:02:42,880
It's going to give us some plot.

59
00:02:43,180 --> 00:02:48,180
Actually,
what I want to know is number of 

60
00:02:48,180 --> 00:02:50,941
students at mit divided by population of
Cambridge specific configure that out.

61
00:02:52,860 --> 00:02:55,510
Um,
and uh,

62
00:02:55,960 --> 00:02:58,120
okay.
It's kind of interesting.

63
00:02:58,150 --> 00:02:59,830
I know that's divided by.
Oh,

64
00:03:00,040 --> 00:03:05,040
that's interesting it guests that we 
were talking about Cambridge University 

65
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:05,740
as the,
as the denominator there.

66
00:03:05,741 --> 00:03:10,741
So it says the number of students at mit
divided by the number of students at 

67
00:03:10,741 --> 00:03:10,930
Cambridge University.
It's interesting.

68
00:03:10,931 --> 00:03:12,580
I'm actually surprised.
Let's see what happens.

69
00:03:12,581 --> 00:03:14,350
If I say con Cambridge a,
the,

70
00:03:14,930 --> 00:03:17,910
I'm not as will probably fail horribly.
No,

71
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:18,790
that's,
that's good.

72
00:03:19,150 --> 00:03:20,290
Okay.
So,

73
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:21,630
um,
no,

74
00:03:21,640 --> 00:03:26,640
that's interesting.
That's a plot as a function of time of 

75
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:26,830
the fraction of the,
uh,

76
00:03:26,860 --> 00:03:28,150
of um,
okay.

77
00:03:28,180 --> 00:03:31,870
So anyway,
so I'm glad it works.

78
00:03:32,170 --> 00:03:33,490
Um,
the uh,

79
00:03:34,870 --> 00:03:38,110
so one,
one question is how did we manage to get

80
00:03:38,111 --> 00:03:41,710
so many things have to work in order to 
get stuff like this to work,

81
00:03:42,700 --> 00:03:44,800
you have to be able to understand the 
natural language,

82
00:03:44,801 --> 00:03:49,801
you have to have data sources,
you have to be able to compute things 

83
00:03:49,801 --> 00:03:49,801
from the data and so on.

84
00:03:50,050 --> 00:03:55,050
One of the things that was a surprise to
me was in terms of natural language 

85
00:03:55,050 --> 00:03:58,321
understanding was the critical thing 
turned out to be just knowing a lot of 

86
00:03:58,811 --> 00:04:03,811
stuff.
The actual pausing of the national 

87
00:04:03,811 --> 00:04:05,110
language is kind of a,
I think it's kind of clever and we use a

88
00:04:05,111 --> 00:04:08,500
bunch of ideas that came from my new 
kind of science project and so on.

89
00:04:08,860 --> 00:04:13,860
But I think the most important thing is 
just knowing a lot of stuff about the 

90
00:04:13,860 --> 00:04:17,101
world is,
is really important to actually being 

91
00:04:17,101 --> 00:04:18,420
able to,
to understand natural language in it and

92
00:04:18,421 --> 00:04:23,090
a useful situation.
I think the other thing is having a,

93
00:04:23,700 --> 00:04:25,950
uh,
actually having access to lots of data.

94
00:04:25,990 --> 00:04:29,140
Let me show you a typical example here 
of what is needed.

95
00:04:29,141 --> 00:04:34,141
So I asked about the ISS and hopefully 
it'll wake up and tell us something 

96
00:04:34,141 --> 00:04:34,240
here.
Come on.

97
00:04:34,270 --> 00:04:35,170
What's going on here?

98
00:04:35,510 --> 00:04:36,310
There we go.
Okay.

99
00:04:36,670 --> 00:04:39,570
So it figured out that we probably are 
talking about a spacecraft,

100
00:04:39,580 --> 00:04:44,580
another file format,
and now it's going to give us a plot 

101
00:04:44,580 --> 00:04:45,100
that shows us where the ISS is right 
now.

102
00:04:45,640 --> 00:04:50,640
So to make this work we obviously have 
to have some feed of a radar tracking 

103
00:04:51,431 --> 00:04:56,431
data about satellites and so on,
which we have for every satellite 

104
00:04:56,431 --> 00:04:56,431
that's,
that's out there.

105
00:04:56,431 --> 00:05:01,250
Um,
but then that's not good enough to just 

106
00:05:01,250 --> 00:05:03,361
have that feed.
Then you also have to be able to do 

107
00:05:03,361 --> 00:05:06,190
celestial mechanics to work out well.
Whereas the ISS actually right now based

108
00:05:06,191 --> 00:05:11,191
on the orbital elements that have been 
deduced from radar and then if we want 

109
00:05:11,191 --> 00:05:11,191
to know things like,
okay,

110
00:05:11,350 --> 00:05:13,870
when is it going to.
It's not currently visible from Boston,

111
00:05:13,871 --> 00:05:17,410
Massachusetts.
It will next rise at 7:36

112
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:18,600
PM,
uh,

113
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:21,650
on Monday and today.
Um,

114
00:05:22,570 --> 00:05:23,390
so,
you know,

115
00:05:23,410 --> 00:05:28,410
this requires a mixture of data about 
what's going on in the world together 

116
00:05:28,841 --> 00:05:31,990
with models about how the world is 
supposed to work.

117
00:05:31,990 --> 00:05:36,990
Being able to predict things and so on.
And I think another thing that kind of 

118
00:05:36,990 --> 00:05:40,171
realized about,
about Ai and so on from the Wolf Malfa 

119
00:05:41,290 --> 00:05:44,270
effort has been that,
you know,

120
00:05:45,070 --> 00:05:50,070
one of the earlier ideas for how long 
would achieve ai was let's make it work.

121
00:05:50,561 --> 00:05:52,970
Kind of like brainstorm and let's make 
it figure stuff out and stuff.

122
00:05:52,980 --> 00:05:57,980
It has to do physics,
let's have it do physics by pure 

123
00:05:57,980 --> 00:05:57,980
reasoning.
Uh,

124
00:05:57,980 --> 00:05:58,390
like,
you know,

125
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:03,400
people at least used to do physics,
but in the last 300 years we've had a 

126
00:06:03,441 --> 00:06:06,920
different way to do physics that wasn't 
sort of based on natural philosophy.

127
00:06:07,130 --> 00:06:09,560
It was instead based on things like 
mathematics.

128
00:06:09,890 --> 00:06:14,890
And so one of the things that we were 
doing and worth Malfa was to kind of 

129
00:06:14,890 --> 00:06:18,080
cheat relative to what had been done in 
previous ai systems,

130
00:06:18,320 --> 00:06:20,810
which was instead of using kind of 
reasoning type methods,

131
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:21,800
were just saying,
okay,

132
00:06:21,801 --> 00:06:24,050
we want to compute where the ISS is 
going to be,

133
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:29,240
but we've got a bunch of equations of 
motion that correspond to differential 

134
00:06:29,240 --> 00:06:29,240
equations.

135
00:06:29,240 --> 00:06:30,380
We're just going to solve the equations 
of motion and get an answer.

136
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:33,560
That's kind of leveraging the last 300 
years or so of,

137
00:06:33,860 --> 00:06:35,900
of,
of exact science that have been done,

138
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:39,170
rather than trying to make use of kind 
of human reasoning ideas.

139
00:06:39,770 --> 00:06:44,770
And I might might say that in terms of 
the history of the wharf Malford 

140
00:06:44,770 --> 00:06:49,220
project,
when I was a kid a disgustingly long 

141
00:06:49,220 --> 00:06:53,381
time ago,
I was interested in ai kinds of things 

142
00:06:53,381 --> 00:06:53,381
and I,
in fact,

143
00:06:53,381 --> 00:06:56,690
I was kind of upset recently to find a 
bunch of stuff I did when I was 12 years

144
00:06:56,691 --> 00:06:59,210
old,
kind of trying to assemble a pre version

145
00:06:59,211 --> 00:07:02,510
of orphan malfa way back before it was 
technologically possible.

146
00:07:02,511 --> 00:07:05,360
But it's also a reminder that one just 
does the same thing.

147
00:07:05,570 --> 00:07:08,360
One's whole life,
so to speak at some level.

148
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:09,500
Um,
but,

149
00:07:09,501 --> 00:07:10,460
uh,
uh,

150
00:07:10,730 --> 00:07:12,440
what happened was when,
when I,

151
00:07:12,441 --> 00:07:17,441
um,
I started off working mainly in physics 

152
00:07:17,570 --> 00:07:22,570
and then I got involved in building 
computer systems to do things like 

153
00:07:22,570 --> 00:07:22,570
mathematical computation and so on.

154
00:07:22,790 --> 00:07:23,450
And,
uh,

155
00:07:23,690 --> 00:07:25,970
I then sort of got interested in,
okay,

156
00:07:26,120 --> 00:07:30,800
so can we generalize this stuff and come
we can we really make a systems that can

157
00:07:30,801 --> 00:07:34,460
answer sort of arbitrary questions about
the world and for example,

158
00:07:34,690 --> 00:07:35,470
uh,
sort of the,

159
00:07:35,480 --> 00:07:36,030
the,
the,

160
00:07:36,050 --> 00:07:41,050
the,
the promise would be if there's 

161
00:07:41,050 --> 00:07:43,250
something that is systematically no one 
in our civilization make it automatic to

162
00:07:43,251 --> 00:07:45,770
answer questions on the base of that 
systematic knowledge.

163
00:07:46,190 --> 00:07:49,180
And back in the,
in around late 19 seventies,

164
00:07:49,190 --> 00:07:54,190
early 19 eighties,
my conclusion was that you wanted to do 

165
00:07:54,190 --> 00:07:54,380
something like that.
The only realistic path to being able to

166
00:07:54,381 --> 00:07:56,870
do it was to build something much like a
brain.

167
00:07:57,200 --> 00:08:02,200
And so I got interested in neural nets 
and I tried to do things with neural 

168
00:08:02,200 --> 00:08:05,171
nets back in 1980 and nothing very 
interesting happened where I couldn't 

169
00:08:05,171 --> 00:08:05,750
get them to do anything very 
interesting.

170
00:08:06,230 --> 00:08:07,850
And uh,
that term.

171
00:08:08,140 --> 00:08:13,140
So I kind of had the idea that,
that the only way to get the kind of 

172
00:08:13,140 --> 00:08:14,000
thing that now exists in Wolf Malfa for 
example,

173
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:18,620
was to build a brain like thing.
And then many years later,

174
00:08:18,650 --> 00:08:23,650
for reasons I can explain,
I kind of came back to this and 

175
00:08:23,650 --> 00:08:27,311
realized,
actually it wasn't true that you had to 

176
00:08:27,311 --> 00:08:27,311
build a brain,
like things sort of mere computation was

177
00:08:27,311 --> 00:08:30,950
sufficient and that was kind of what got
me started actually trying to build both

178
00:08:30,951 --> 00:08:33,290
Malfa when we started building wealth 
Malfa,

179
00:08:33,430 --> 00:08:38,430
one of the things I did was go to a sort
of a field trip to a big reference 

180
00:08:38,430 --> 00:08:42,041
library and you know,
you see all these shelves of books and 

181
00:08:42,041 --> 00:08:42,041
so on.
And the question is,

182
00:08:42,041 --> 00:08:46,301
can we take all of this knowledge that 
exists in all of these books and 

183
00:08:46,301 --> 00:08:48,110
actually automate being able to answer 
questions on the basis of it.

184
00:08:48,380 --> 00:08:50,570
And I think we've pretty much done that 
for that,

185
00:08:50,630 --> 00:08:53,240
at least the books you find than a 
typical reference library.

186
00:08:53,530 --> 00:08:55,030
Um,
so that was a,

187
00:08:55,530 --> 00:08:57,920
it looked kind of daunting at the 
beginning because it's this,

188
00:08:58,020 --> 00:09:00,540
there's a lot of knowledge and 
information out there.

189
00:09:00,780 --> 00:09:05,780
But actually it turns out there are a 
few thousand domains and we've steadily 

190
00:09:05,780 --> 00:09:07,080
gone through and worked on these 
different domains.

191
00:09:07,290 --> 00:09:10,380
Another feature of the wharf project was
that we didn't really,

192
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:11,150
uh,
you know,

193
00:09:11,160 --> 00:09:14,670
I've been involved a lot in doing basic 
science and trying to have sort of grand

194
00:09:14,671 --> 00:09:17,940
theories of the world.
One of my principals in building Wolfram

195
00:09:17,940 --> 00:09:22,940
Alpha was not to start from a grand 
theory of the world that is not to kind 

196
00:09:22,940 --> 00:09:26,241
of start from some global ontology of 
the world and then try and build down 

197
00:09:26,241 --> 00:09:28,530
into all these different domains,
but instead to work up from having,

198
00:09:28,690 --> 00:09:33,690
you know,
hundreds then thousands of domains that 

199
00:09:33,690 --> 00:09:33,690
actually work,
whether they're,

200
00:09:33,690 --> 00:09:37,450
you know,
information about cars or information 

201
00:09:37,450 --> 00:09:38,070
about sports or information about movies
or whatever else,

202
00:09:38,280 --> 00:09:39,810
how each of these domains.

203
00:09:40,060 --> 00:09:43,230
I'm sort of building up from the bottom 
in each of these domains.

204
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:48,500
And then finding that there were common 
themes in these domains that we could 

205
00:09:48,500 --> 00:09:51,411
then build into frameworks and then sort
of construct the whole system on the 

206
00:09:51,411 --> 00:09:51,750
basis of that.
And that's kind of,

207
00:09:51,810 --> 00:09:56,810
that's kind of how it's worked.
And I can talk about some of the actual 

208
00:09:56,810 --> 00:09:56,810
frameworks that we ended up using and so
on.

209
00:09:56,810 --> 00:09:57,420
Um,
but,

210
00:09:57,421 --> 00:10:02,421
uh,
maybe I should explain a little bit 

211
00:10:02,421 --> 00:10:02,421
more.
So,

212
00:10:02,421 --> 00:10:03,870
so one question is,
how does,

213
00:10:03,900 --> 00:10:06,480
how does wealth map are actually sort of
work inside?

214
00:10:06,930 --> 00:10:09,990
And the answer is it's a big program,
it's about,

215
00:10:10,380 --> 00:10:14,280
it's the core system has about 15 
million lines of Wolfram language code,

216
00:10:14,580 --> 00:10:17,220
um,
and it's some number of terabytes of raw

217
00:10:17,221 --> 00:10:18,260
data.
Um,

218
00:10:18,990 --> 00:10:21,340
and uh,
so the,

219
00:10:21,500 --> 00:10:26,500
the way,
the thing that sort of made building 

220
00:10:26,500 --> 00:10:29,631
wealth now for possible was this 
language Wolfram from language which 

221
00:10:29,631 --> 00:10:33,330
started with Mathematica,
which came out in 1988 and has been sort

222
00:10:33,331 --> 00:10:35,010
of progressively growing since then.

223
00:10:35,340 --> 00:10:37,950
So maybe I should show you some things 
about wealth language and,

224
00:10:37,980 --> 00:10:38,610
and,
uh,

225
00:10:39,030 --> 00:10:39,840
you know,
it's easy.

226
00:10:39,841 --> 00:10:42,960
You can go use this.
Mit has a site license for it,

227
00:10:42,961 --> 00:10:46,500
you can use it all over the place,
you can find it on the web,

228
00:10:46,501 --> 00:10:47,100
et Cetera,
et Cetera,

229
00:10:47,101 --> 00:10:48,390
et cetera.
Um,

230
00:10:48,810 --> 00:10:49,530
but,
uh,

231
00:10:50,590 --> 00:10:52,860
okay,
the basics work.

232
00:10:53,190 --> 00:10:54,420
Um,
the uh,

233
00:10:54,440 --> 00:10:55,050
let,
let's,

234
00:10:55,080 --> 00:11:00,080
let's start off with something like,
let's make a random graph and um,

235
00:11:00,660 --> 00:11:03,330
let's say we have a random graph with 
200 nodes,

236
00:11:03,331 --> 00:11:04,500
400 vertices.
Okay.

237
00:11:04,501 --> 00:11:09,501
So those isn't random graph.
The first important thing about Wilson 

238
00:11:09,501 --> 00:11:09,501
languages,
it's a symbolic language.

239
00:11:09,501 --> 00:11:12,010
So I can just pick up this graph and I 
could say,

240
00:11:12,011 --> 00:11:17,011
you know,
I want to do some analysis of this 

241
00:11:17,011 --> 00:11:17,011
graph.
That graph is just a symbolic thing that

242
00:11:17,011 --> 00:11:20,310
I can just do computations on.
Or I could say let's,

243
00:11:20,311 --> 00:11:22,010
let's get a um,
a,

244
00:11:22,210 --> 00:11:25,110
another good thing to do is get a 
current image.

245
00:11:25,710 --> 00:11:26,880
See,
there we go.

246
00:11:27,270 --> 00:11:32,270
Um,
and now I could go and say something 

247
00:11:32,270 --> 00:11:32,270
like,
um,

248
00:11:32,270 --> 00:11:32,270
uh,
let's,

249
00:11:32,270 --> 00:11:37,250
let's do some basic thing.
Let's say let's edge detect that image 

250
00:11:37,250 --> 00:11:37,250
again,
this,

251
00:11:37,250 --> 00:11:40,320
this image is just a thing that we can 
manipulate.

252
00:11:40,321 --> 00:11:42,030
We could take the image,
we could make it.

253
00:11:42,031 --> 00:11:43,270
Um,
uh,

254
00:11:44,450 --> 00:11:46,620
I don't know.
We could take the image and petitioners,

255
00:11:46,621 --> 00:11:49,410
little pieces.
Do computations on that.

256
00:11:49,770 --> 00:11:50,850
I don't know.
Simple.

257
00:11:50,910 --> 00:11:55,910
Let's do,
let's just say sought each row of the 

258
00:11:55,910 --> 00:11:56,470
image.
Assemble the image again.

259
00:11:56,471 --> 00:11:56,950
Whoops.

260
00:12:00,820 --> 00:12:02,230
Assemble,
let image again.

261
00:12:02,231 --> 00:12:04,300
We'll get some,
some mixed up picture there.

262
00:12:04,630 --> 00:12:05,650
If I wanted to,
I could,

263
00:12:05,651 --> 00:12:10,651
for example,
let's say let's make that the current 

264
00:12:10,651 --> 00:12:12,601
image and let's say make that dynamic.
I can be just running that code 

265
00:12:12,701 --> 00:12:15,430
hopefully,
and it'll loop and we can,

266
00:12:15,830 --> 00:12:17,410
uh,
make that work.

267
00:12:17,770 --> 00:12:22,660
So the one,
one general point here is,

268
00:12:23,100 --> 00:12:28,100
there's no,
this is just an image for us is just a 

269
00:12:28,100 --> 00:12:28,100
piece of data.
Like anything else,

270
00:12:28,100 --> 00:12:30,300
if we just have a variable a thing 
called x,

271
00:12:30,301 --> 00:12:31,150
it just says,
okay,

272
00:12:31,151 --> 00:12:33,580
that's X.
I don't need to know particular value.

273
00:12:33,581 --> 00:12:37,390
It's just a symbolic thing that 
corresponds to a,

274
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:40,300
that's a thing called x.
Now you know,

275
00:12:40,360 --> 00:12:45,360
what gets interesting when you have a 
symbolic language and so on is we're 

276
00:12:45,401 --> 00:12:49,750
interested in having it represent stuff 
about the world as well as just abstract

277
00:12:49,751 --> 00:12:50,380
kinds of things.
I mean,

278
00:12:50,381 --> 00:12:50,610
I,
you know,

279
00:12:50,620 --> 00:12:52,440
I can abstractly say,
you know,

280
00:12:52,810 --> 00:12:55,400
find some funky integral,
um,

281
00:12:56,290 --> 00:12:57,340
I don't know what,
you know,

282
00:12:57,341 --> 00:13:02,341
that's then representing a using 
symbolic variables to represent 

283
00:13:02,341 --> 00:13:03,490
algebraic kinds of things.

284
00:13:03,490 --> 00:13:08,490
But I could also just say I dunno,
something like Boston and Boston is 

285
00:13:08,490 --> 00:13:11,310
another kind of symbolic thing that,
uh,

286
00:13:11,470 --> 00:13:12,800
has.
If I say what,

287
00:13:12,801 --> 00:13:15,760
what does it really inside that's,
it's the entity,

288
00:13:16,140 --> 00:13:17,620
a city,
Boston,

289
00:13:17,621 --> 00:13:22,621
Massachusetts,
United States actually noticed when I 

290
00:13:22,621 --> 00:13:25,471
type that in,
I was using natural language to type it 

291
00:13:25,471 --> 00:13:26,230
in and it gave me a bunch of 
disambiguation here.

292
00:13:26,231 --> 00:13:28,660
It said,
assuming Boston as a city,

293
00:13:28,960 --> 00:13:29,830
uh,
assuming Boston,

294
00:13:29,831 --> 00:13:31,180
Massachusetts,
use Boston,

295
00:13:31,181 --> 00:13:32,350
New York or.
Okay,

296
00:13:32,351 --> 00:13:33,130
there's,
let's use,

297
00:13:33,370 --> 00:13:35,860
let's use Boston in the Philippines,
which I've never heard of,

298
00:13:35,861 --> 00:13:37,580
but um,
uh,

299
00:13:37,650 --> 00:13:40,240
let's try using that instead.
And now if I look at that,

300
00:13:40,540 --> 00:13:43,720
it'll say it's Boston in some province 
of the Philippines,

301
00:13:43,730 --> 00:13:44,290
etc.
Etc.

302
00:13:44,300 --> 00:13:46,990
Etc.
Now I might ask it of that.

303
00:13:46,991 --> 00:13:51,991
I could say somEthing like,
what's the population of that?

304
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:53,980
Um,
and it,

305
00:13:53,981 --> 00:13:55,650
um,
uh,

306
00:13:55,660 --> 00:13:57,310
okay.
It's a fairly small place.

307
00:13:57,640 --> 00:13:58,900
Or I could say,
for example,

308
00:13:58,901 --> 00:13:59,770
let me,
let me do this.

309
00:13:59,771 --> 00:14:04,771
Let me say jill list plot from that 
bostoN a take from that boston too.

310
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:14,000
And now let's type In boston again and 
now let's have it used the default 

311
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,790
meaning of the word of boston.
and then let's join those up.

312
00:14:16,130 --> 00:14:17,870
And now this should plot,
um,

313
00:14:17,950 --> 00:14:21,010
this should show me a plot.
There we go.

314
00:14:21,011 --> 00:14:22,030
Okay,
so there's the,

315
00:14:22,031 --> 00:14:25,330
um,
a path from the boston that we picked in

316
00:14:25,331 --> 00:14:27,370
the Philippines to the boston here.
Oh,

317
00:14:27,371 --> 00:14:28,330
we could ask it.
I don't know.

318
00:14:28,331 --> 00:14:29,360
I could just say,
um,

319
00:14:29,810 --> 00:14:32,620
I could ask it the distance from one to 
another or something like that.

320
00:14:33,130 --> 00:14:34,420
So the,
the,

321
00:14:34,421 --> 00:14:37,810
one of the thIngs here,
one things we found really,

322
00:14:37,840 --> 00:14:40,050
really useful actually in both 
languages.

323
00:14:40,051 --> 00:14:45,051
The first of all,
there's a way of representing stuff 

324
00:14:45,051 --> 00:14:45,051
about the world,
like cities for example.

325
00:14:45,100 --> 00:14:46,450
Well,
let's say I want to say let's,

326
00:14:46,451 --> 00:14:47,740
let's do this.
Let's say,

327
00:14:48,220 --> 00:14:49,860
uh,
uh,

328
00:14:49,870 --> 00:14:54,870
let's do something,
let's say capital cities in south 

329
00:14:54,870 --> 00:14:54,870
America.
Okay.

330
00:14:54,870 --> 00:14:56,540
So notice this is a piece of natural 
language.

331
00:14:56,870 --> 00:15:01,870
This will get interpreted into something
which is precise symbolic language code 

332
00:15:03,500 --> 00:15:07,310
that we can then compute with and that 
will give us the citizens of the capital

333
00:15:07,311 --> 00:15:09,500
cities in south America.
I could,

334
00:15:09,501 --> 00:15:12,040
for example,
let's say I say fine shortest tour.

335
00:15:12,041 --> 00:15:14,510
So now I'm going to use some,
uh,

336
00:15:14,990 --> 00:15:16,280
some ups.
No,

337
00:15:16,281 --> 00:15:18,950
I don't want to do that,
but I want to do first is to say,

338
00:15:18,951 --> 00:15:23,220
show me the job positions of all those 
cities online,

339
00:15:23,330 --> 00:15:28,330
21 there,
so now it will find the geo positions 

340
00:15:28,330 --> 00:15:28,970
and now we'll say compute the shortest 
tour.

341
00:15:29,210 --> 00:15:34,210
So that's saying there's a 10,000
mile traveling salesman tour around 

342
00:15:34,371 --> 00:15:36,770
those cities.
So I could take those cities were online

343
00:15:36,771 --> 00:15:41,771
21 and I could say order the cities 
according to this and then I could make 

344
00:15:42,171 --> 00:15:46,040
another geo lists a lot of that,
join it up.

345
00:15:46,450 --> 00:15:49,480
Um,
and this should now show us a,

346
00:15:49,481 --> 00:15:51,880
a traveling salesman tour of the,
um,

347
00:15:51,910 --> 00:15:54,690
of the capital cities in south America.
Um,

348
00:15:55,010 --> 00:15:56,210
so,
you know,

349
00:15:56,211 --> 00:16:01,211
it's,
it's sort of interesting to see what's 

350
00:16:01,211 --> 00:16:01,211
involved in making stuff like this work.
Um,

351
00:16:01,211 --> 00:16:02,540
the uh,
uh,

352
00:16:03,020 --> 00:16:08,020
one of my,
my goal has been to sort of automate as 

353
00:16:08,020 --> 00:16:12,191
much as possible about things that have 
to be computed and that means knowing as

354
00:16:12,380 --> 00:16:17,380
many algorithms as possible and also 
knowing as much data about the world as 

355
00:16:17,380 --> 00:16:22,241
possible.
And I kind of view this as sort of a 

356
00:16:22,241 --> 00:16:25,210
knowledge based programming approach 
where you have a typical kind of idea 

357
00:16:25,881 --> 00:16:30,881
and programming languages as you know,
we have some small programming 

358
00:16:30,881 --> 00:16:33,791
languages,
has a few primitives that are pretty 

359
00:16:33,791 --> 00:16:36,341
much tied into what a machine can 
intrinsically do and then maybe you'll 

360
00:16:36,341 --> 00:16:38,270
have libraries that add onto that.
And so on.

361
00:16:38,510 --> 00:16:43,510
My kind of a crazy idea of many,
many years ago has been to build an 

362
00:16:44,031 --> 00:16:48,800
integrated system where all of the stuff
about different domains of knowledge and

363
00:16:48,801 --> 00:16:52,460
so on are all just built into the system
and uh,

364
00:16:52,640 --> 00:16:57,640
and designed in a coherent way.
I mean this has been kind of the story 

365
00:16:57,640 --> 00:17:00,941
of my life for the last 30 years,
is trying to keep the design of the 

366
00:17:00,941 --> 00:17:03,761
system coherent even as one adds all 
sorts of different areas of,

367
00:17:04,250 --> 00:17:04,980
of,
uh,

368
00:17:05,630 --> 00:17:09,020
of capability.
So as,

369
00:17:09,021 --> 00:17:11,270
um,
I mean we can go and dive into all sorts

370
00:17:11,271 --> 00:17:12,820
of different kinds of things here.
But,

371
00:17:12,821 --> 00:17:15,050
um,
maybe as an example.

372
00:17:15,290 --> 00:17:15,980
Well,
let's do,

373
00:17:15,981 --> 00:17:18,210
what could we do here we could take.
Um,

374
00:17:18,500 --> 00:17:20,690
let's try.
How about this?

375
00:17:20,691 --> 00:17:23,000
Is that a bone?
I think so that's a bone.

376
00:17:23,480 --> 00:17:28,480
So let's try a that as a mesh region,
see if that works.

377
00:17:32,540 --> 00:17:35,120
So this will now Use a completely 
different domain of,

378
00:17:35,121 --> 00:17:36,860
um,
of human endeavor.

379
00:17:36,890 --> 00:17:37,640
Okay.
Whoops.

380
00:17:37,641 --> 00:17:39,200
There's two of those buttons.
Let's try,

381
00:17:39,201 --> 00:17:44,201
let's just try a,
let's try left humerus and let's try 

382
00:17:44,901 --> 00:17:45,480
the,
the,

383
00:17:45,560 --> 00:17:48,080
that,
the mesh region for that.

384
00:17:48,560 --> 00:17:50,700
And now we should have a bone here.
Okay.

385
00:17:50,770 --> 00:17:54,090
There's a representational of bone.
Let's take that bone.

386
00:17:54,150 --> 00:17:55,020
We could,
for example,

387
00:17:55,021 --> 00:18:00,021
say um,
let's take the surface area of that as 

388
00:18:00,021 --> 00:18:04,551
in some some units or I could let,
let's do some much more outrageous 

389
00:18:04,551 --> 00:18:04,551
thing.
Let's say we take,

390
00:18:04,870 --> 00:18:06,780
um,
region distance.

391
00:18:06,781 --> 00:18:10,050
So we're going to take the distance from
some,

392
00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:15,080
from that bone to a point,
let's say zero,

393
00:18:15,451 --> 00:18:16,410
zero,
z,

394
00:18:16,770 --> 00:18:21,770
and let's make a plot of that distance 
with z going from,

395
00:18:22,080 --> 00:18:24,960
let's say I have no idea where the,
where the bone is,

396
00:18:24,961 --> 00:18:27,960
but let's try something like this.
So that was really borIng.

397
00:18:30,920 --> 00:18:31,900
Let's try.
Um,

398
00:18:32,490 --> 00:18:34,110
so what this is doing,
again,

399
00:18:34,350 --> 00:18:36,680
a whole bunch of stuff has to work in 
order for this to,

400
00:18:36,740 --> 00:18:38,280
to operate this test,
to be.

401
00:18:38,281 --> 00:18:43,281
This is a,
this is some region in three d space 

402
00:18:43,281 --> 00:18:43,740
that's represented by some mesh.
You have to compute,

403
00:18:43,790 --> 00:18:48,790
you know,
do the computational geometry to figure 

404
00:18:48,790 --> 00:18:48,790
out where it is.
If I wanted to let,

405
00:18:48,790 --> 00:18:50,790
let's try anatomy,
anatomy,

406
00:18:50,791 --> 00:18:55,791
plot three d,
and let's say something like lefthand 

407
00:18:55,791 --> 00:18:59,390
for example,
and now it's going to show us probably 

408
00:18:59,390 --> 00:19:00,390
the complete data that it has about the 
geometry of,

409
00:19:00,420 --> 00:19:00,990
of,
um,

410
00:19:01,420 --> 00:19:04,050
uh,
of a lefthand.

411
00:19:05,420 --> 00:19:06,710
There we gO.
Um,

412
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:08,040
okay.
So there's,

413
00:19:08,090 --> 00:19:13,090
there's the results.
And we could take that apart and start 

414
00:19:13,090 --> 00:19:13,090
computIng things from it.
And so on.

415
00:19:13,090 --> 00:19:17,930
So what I'm a.
So this is,

416
00:19:19,490 --> 00:19:20,590
um,
um,

417
00:19:22,140 --> 00:19:22,580
so there's,
uh,

418
00:19:22,581 --> 00:19:25,710
there's a lot of kind of computational 
knowledge that's built in here.

419
00:19:26,120 --> 00:19:27,510
Um,
one,

420
00:19:28,150 --> 00:19:28,490
uh,
let's,

421
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:31,580
let's talk a little bit about kind of 
the modern machine learning story.

422
00:19:31,581 --> 00:19:33,270
So for instance,
if I say,

423
00:19:33,540 --> 00:19:35,160
let's get a picture here.
Let's say,

424
00:19:35,161 --> 00:19:36,390
um,
let's,

425
00:19:36,420 --> 00:19:40,500
let's just say picture of assembly.
Got a favorite kind of animal.

426
00:19:43,050 --> 00:19:44,910
What?
Panda.

427
00:19:48,510 --> 00:19:50,010
Okay,
so let's try.

428
00:19:50,490 --> 00:19:52,050
Okay.
Giant panda.

429
00:19:52,680 --> 00:19:54,000
Okay.
Okay,

430
00:19:54,010 --> 00:19:55,770
there's a panda.
Let's see what,

431
00:19:55,771 --> 00:19:58,020
um,
now let's try saying,

432
00:19:59,510 --> 00:20:02,880
let's try for this panda.
Let's try saying image identify,

433
00:20:03,840 --> 00:20:05,640
and now here will be embarrassed 
probably,

434
00:20:05,641 --> 00:20:07,560
but let's just see.
Let's see what happens.

435
00:20:07,561 --> 00:20:12,561
If I say image,
identify that and now it'll hopefully 

436
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:13,800
wake up,
wake up,

437
00:20:13,801 --> 00:20:18,801
wake up.
This only takes a few hundred 

438
00:20:18,801 --> 00:20:18,801
milliseconds.
Okay,

439
00:20:18,801 --> 00:20:18,801
very good.
John panto.

440
00:20:18,801 --> 00:20:18,810
Let's,
let's see what it will see.

441
00:20:18,811 --> 00:20:20,940
What the runners up were to the giant 
panda.

442
00:20:21,480 --> 00:20:23,160
Um,
uh,

443
00:20:25,020 --> 00:20:30,020
let's say we want to say the ten one is 
up in all categories for that thing.

444
00:20:31,290 --> 00:20:33,360
Okay.
So giant panda,

445
00:20:33,370 --> 00:20:36,690
a kitchenaid,
which I've never heard of.

446
00:20:37,460 --> 00:20:42,210
Our pandas.
Commerce eat bamboo shoots.

447
00:20:42,211 --> 00:20:44,340
Okay.
So that was so lucky.

448
00:20:44,341 --> 00:20:49,341
It didn't get that one.
It's really sure it's a mammal and it's 

449
00:20:49,341 --> 00:20:50,620
absolutely certain it's a vertebrate.
Okay.

450
00:20:50,621 --> 00:20:52,840
So you might ask how did it figure this 
out?

451
00:20:53,370 --> 00:20:57,190
And so then you can kind of look under 
the hood and say,

452
00:20:57,660 --> 00:21:01,420
so we have a whole framework for 
representing neuron that symbolically.

453
00:21:01,750 --> 00:21:05,560
And so this is the actual model that 
it's using to do this.

454
00:21:05,561 --> 00:21:08,800
So this is a um,
so there's a neural net and it's got.

455
00:21:09,070 --> 00:21:12,520
We can drill down and we can see there's
a piece of the neural net.

456
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:17,880
We can drill down even further to one of
these and we can probably see what 

457
00:21:17,880 --> 00:21:18,310
that's our batch normalization layer 
somewhere deep,

458
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:21,490
deep inside the trails of the not 
pander,

459
00:21:21,491 --> 00:21:23,950
but to have this thing.
Okay,

460
00:21:24,190 --> 00:21:28,060
so now let's take that object which has 
just a symbolic object and let's feed it

461
00:21:28,120 --> 00:21:33,120
the picture of the panda and we can see 
'em and the ups.

462
00:21:34,630 --> 00:21:37,660
I was not giving up the right thing.
What did I do wrong here?

463
00:21:37,960 --> 00:21:38,710
Let's.
Let's take.

464
00:21:38,770 --> 00:21:39,550
Oh,
I see what I did.

465
00:21:39,940 --> 00:21:44,940
Okay,
let's take this thing and feed it the 

466
00:21:44,940 --> 00:21:44,940
picture of the panda and it says a giant
panda.

467
00:21:44,940 --> 00:21:49,590
Okay.
How about we do something more 

468
00:21:49,590 --> 00:21:49,590
outrageous?
Let's take that neuron that.

469
00:21:49,590 --> 00:21:52,570
And let's only use the first,
let's say 10 layers of the neuron that.

470
00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:56,530
So let's just take out 10 layers of the 
neuron that and feed it the panda.

471
00:21:56,950 --> 00:22:00,700
And now what we'll get is something from
the insides of the neuron that.

472
00:22:01,090 --> 00:22:03,790
And I could say for example,
let's just make those into images.

473
00:22:03,791 --> 00:22:04,720
Okay?
So that's what.

474
00:22:04,900 --> 00:22:09,900
That's what the neural net had figured 
out about the panda after 10 layers of 

475
00:22:10,781 --> 00:22:13,840
going through the neuron that and maybe 
actually be interesting to see,

476
00:22:13,841 --> 00:22:18,841
let's do a feature space plots and now 
we're going to have those intermediate 

477
00:22:19,360 --> 00:22:22,330
things in the brain of the neural net so
to speak.

478
00:22:22,590 --> 00:22:24,130
Um,
this is now taking.

479
00:22:24,340 --> 00:22:29,340
So what this is doing is to do dimension
reduction on this space of images.

480
00:22:31,840 --> 00:22:36,840
And so not very exciting.
It's probabLy mostly distinguishing 

481
00:22:36,840 --> 00:22:36,840
these by,
by total gray level,

482
00:22:36,840 --> 00:22:38,470
but that's kind of showing us the space 
of,

483
00:22:38,471 --> 00:22:40,020
um,
of different term,

484
00:22:40,390 --> 00:22:43,120
a different sort of features of the 
insides of the chanel on that.

485
00:22:43,330 --> 00:22:48,330
So it's also what's interesting to see 
here is things like the symbolic 

486
00:22:48,330 --> 00:22:48,800
representation of the neuron nets.
And if you,

487
00:22:48,801 --> 00:22:50,800
if you're wondering how does that 
actually work inside,

488
00:22:51,100 --> 00:22:54,580
it's underneath it susan mx net,
which we happen to have contributed to a

489
00:22:54,581 --> 00:22:58,960
lot and there's sort of a bunch of 
symbolic layers on top of that that feed

490
00:22:58,961 --> 00:23:01,270
into that.
And maybe I can show you here,

491
00:23:01,271 --> 00:23:06,271
let,
let me show you how you would train one 

492
00:23:06,271 --> 00:23:06,271
of these neural nets.
That's also kind of fun.

493
00:23:06,271 --> 00:23:09,820
So we have a data repository that has 
all sorts of useful data.

494
00:23:10,120 --> 00:23:13,790
One piece of data it has is a bunch of 
neuron that training set.

495
00:23:13,790 --> 00:23:18,790
So this is the standard training set of 
handwritten digits.

496
00:23:19,060 --> 00:23:24,060
Okay.
So there's amnesty and you notice that 

497
00:23:24,060 --> 00:23:26,491
these things here,
that's Just an image which I could copy 

498
00:23:26,491 --> 00:23:28,480
out and I could do,
let's say I could do color and a gate on

499
00:23:28,481 --> 00:23:30,550
that image because it's just an image.
Um,

500
00:23:30,970 --> 00:23:32,830
and there's,
there's the results and so on.

501
00:23:33,190 --> 00:23:35,470
And now I could say,
let's take,

502
00:23:35,530 --> 00:23:40,530
let's take a neuron that like,
let's take a simple neural net like 

503
00:23:40,530 --> 00:23:40,530
lynette for example.
Um,

504
00:23:40,530 --> 00:23:45,330
okay.
So let's take lanette and then let's 

505
00:23:45,330 --> 00:23:47,240
take the untrained initial evaluation 
network.

506
00:23:47,241 --> 00:23:50,810
So this is now a version of love,
that simple standard neuron that,

507
00:23:51,110 --> 00:23:53,300
that didn't get trained.
So for example,

508
00:23:53,301 --> 00:23:54,500
if I,
if I take that,

509
00:23:54,560 --> 00:23:59,560
that symBolic representation of that,
and I could say net initialize than it 

510
00:23:59,811 --> 00:24:03,930
will take that and it'll just put random
weights until the net.

511
00:24:04,190 --> 00:24:04,380
Okay?

512
00:24:04,380 --> 00:24:08,030
So if I take those random weights and I 
feed it a zero here,

513
00:24:08,330 --> 00:24:10,100
I feed it,
that image of a zero,

514
00:24:10,370 --> 00:24:15,370
it will presumaBly produced something 
completely random and this particular 

515
00:24:15,370 --> 00:24:15,370
case too,
right?

516
00:24:15,370 --> 00:24:20,170
So now,
now what I would like to do is to take 

517
00:24:20,170 --> 00:24:22,841
this.
So thAt was just randomly initializing 

518
00:24:22,841 --> 00:24:22,841
the weights.
So now what I'd like to do is to take,

519
00:24:22,841 --> 00:24:27,580
uh,
the training set and I'd like to 

520
00:24:27,580 --> 00:24:29,450
actually train a learn at using eminence
training set.

521
00:24:29,451 --> 00:24:34,451
So let's take,
let's take this and let's take a random 

522
00:24:34,451 --> 00:24:37,220
sample of a.
Let's say I don't know,

523
00:24:37,221 --> 00:24:40,970
a thousand pieces of lanette.
Come on.

524
00:24:40,971 --> 00:24:42,560
Why is it having to load it again?
There we go.

525
00:24:42,561 --> 00:24:43,730
Okay.
So there's a,

526
00:24:43,731 --> 00:24:46,680
there's a random sample a was on line 
21.

527
00:24:46,681 --> 00:24:50,670
And now let me go down here and say,
uh,

528
00:24:50,671 --> 00:24:52,940
what was it?
Well we can just take this,

529
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:54,020
this thing here.

530
00:24:54,350 --> 00:24:59,350
So this is the uninitialized version of 
lanette and we can say take that.

531
00:25:00,050 --> 00:25:04,910
And then let's say net train of that 
with the thing on line 21,

532
00:25:04,911 --> 00:25:09,911
which was that thousand instances.
So now what it's doing is it's running 

533
00:25:09,911 --> 00:25:10,520
training on,
um,

534
00:25:10,610 --> 00:25:13,310
and that's,
you see the loss going down and so on.

535
00:25:13,610 --> 00:25:15,560
It's running the training for,
uh,

536
00:25:15,770 --> 00:25:18,380
for those thousand instances of,
of uh,

537
00:25:18,790 --> 00:25:20,480
uh,
lynette and it will,

538
00:25:20,481 --> 00:25:22,490
we can stop it if we want to.
Actually,

539
00:25:22,491 --> 00:25:24,350
this is a new display.
This is very nice.

540
00:25:24,560 --> 00:25:29,560
This is,
this is a new version of language which 

541
00:25:29,560 --> 00:25:29,560
is coming out next week,
which I'm showing you,

542
00:25:29,560 --> 00:25:31,370
But it's quite similar to what exists 
today,

543
00:25:31,400 --> 00:25:36,400
but because that's one of the features 
of running a software company is that 

544
00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:39,020
you always run the very latest version 
of things for better or worse.

545
00:25:39,520 --> 00:25:44,520
And that's,
and this is also a good way to debug it 

546
00:25:44,520 --> 00:25:44,520
was supposed to come out next week.

547
00:25:44,520 --> 00:25:45,740
If I find some horrifying bug,
maybe we'll get to later,

548
00:25:46,520 --> 00:25:50,510
but let's try and let's,
um,

549
00:25:50,660 --> 00:25:52,520
let's try this.
Okay,

550
00:25:52,550 --> 00:25:54,380
now it says it's zero.
Okay?

551
00:25:54,800 --> 00:25:59,800
And so,
so this is now a trained version of 

552
00:25:59,800 --> 00:25:59,800
lynette trained with that,
uh,

553
00:25:59,800 --> 00:26:04,210
with that training data.
I'm one of the things so we can talk 

554
00:26:04,210 --> 00:26:06,680
about all kinds of details of,
of neural nets and so on.

555
00:26:07,010 --> 00:26:09,950
But maybe I should zoom out to talk a 
little bit about bigger picture as it,

556
00:26:09,951 --> 00:26:14,951
as I see it.
So one question is a sort of a question 

557
00:26:17,841 --> 00:26:21,050
of what is in principle possible to do 
with computation?

558
00:26:21,440 --> 00:26:21,900
So,
you know,

559
00:26:21,970 --> 00:26:23,690
we have as we're,
you know,

560
00:26:23,691 --> 00:26:28,691
we're building all kinds of things.
We're making image identifiers were 

561
00:26:28,691 --> 00:26:32,050
figuring out all kinds of things about 
where the international space station 

562
00:26:32,050 --> 00:26:32,420
is.
And so on question is what is,

563
00:26:32,480 --> 00:26:34,970
what is in principle possible to 
compute?

564
00:26:35,630 --> 00:26:37,310
and so the,
uh,

565
00:26:37,600 --> 00:26:42,600
you know,
one of the places one can ask that 

566
00:26:42,600 --> 00:26:42,600
question is when one looks at,
for example,

567
00:26:42,600 --> 00:26:44,010
models of the natural world can say,
you know,

568
00:26:44,011 --> 00:26:45,930
how do we make models of the natural 
world?

569
00:26:46,170 --> 00:26:48,600
Kind of a,
a traditional approach has been,

570
00:26:48,810 --> 00:26:51,900
let's use mathematical equations to make
models of the natural world.

571
00:26:52,180 --> 00:26:55,590
A question is if we want to kind of 
generalize that and say,

572
00:26:55,591 --> 00:27:00,591
well,
what are all possible ways to make 

573
00:27:00,591 --> 00:27:00,591
models of things?
What can we say about that question?

574
00:27:00,840 --> 00:27:04,440
So I spent many years in my lifetime to 
address that question.

575
00:27:04,890 --> 00:27:09,890
And basically what I've thought about a 
lot is that if you want to make a model 

576
00:27:10,291 --> 00:27:12,450
of a thing,
you have to have definite rules by which

577
00:27:12,451 --> 00:27:15,510
the thing operates.
What's the most general way to represent

578
00:27:15,720 --> 00:27:19,260
possible rules while in today's world we
think of that as a program.

579
00:27:19,530 --> 00:27:20,640
So the next question is,
well,

580
00:27:20,641 --> 00:27:23,400
what does the space of all possiBle 
programs look like?

581
00:27:23,940 --> 00:27:25,020
And most of the time,
you know,

582
00:27:25,040 --> 00:27:29,280
we're writing programs like wolfram 
language is 50 million lines of code and

583
00:27:29,281 --> 00:27:33,780
it's a big complicated program that was 
for built for fairly specific purpose.

584
00:27:34,080 --> 00:27:39,080
But the question is if we just look At 
sort of the space of possible programs 

585
00:27:39,080 --> 00:27:43,040
more or less at random,
what's out there in the space of 

586
00:27:43,040 --> 00:27:45,111
possible program.
So I got an interest in many years ago 

587
00:27:45,111 --> 00:27:48,200
in cellular automata,
which are really good example of a very 

588
00:27:48,200 --> 00:27:51,411
simple kind of program.
So let me show you an example of one of 

589
00:27:51,411 --> 00:27:51,411
these.
So this is,

590
00:27:51,411 --> 00:27:53,880
these are the rules for a typical 
cellular automaton.

591
00:27:54,210 --> 00:27:57,990
And this just says you have a row of 
black and white squares.

592
00:27:58,230 --> 00:28:01,080
And this just says,
you look at a black look at a square,

593
00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:02,370
say what color is that square?

594
00:28:02,370 --> 00:28:07,370
What color left left.
And right neighbors decide what color 

595
00:28:07,370 --> 00:28:08,460
the square will be on the next step 
based on that rule.

596
00:28:08,610 --> 00:28:10,050
Okay?
So really simple rule.

597
00:28:10,350 --> 00:28:12,300
So now let's,
let's take a look at what,

598
00:28:12,570 --> 00:28:17,570
what actually happens if we use that 
rule a bunch of times so we can take 

599
00:28:17,570 --> 00:28:18,240
that rule.
The 2:54

600
00:28:18,241 --> 00:28:23,241
is just the binary digits that 
correspond to those positions and this 

601
00:28:23,241 --> 00:28:25,020
rule.
So now I can say this,

602
00:28:25,021 --> 00:28:27,600
I could say let's do 50 steps,
let me do this.

603
00:28:28,080 --> 00:28:33,080
And now if I run according to the rule I
just defined,

604
00:28:33,570 --> 00:28:36,600
it turns out to be pretty trivial.
It's just sAying,

605
00:28:36,880 --> 00:28:37,890
uh,
if any,

606
00:28:37,920 --> 00:28:40,650
if any square is we start off with a 
black square.

607
00:28:40,651 --> 00:28:42,090
If any square is,
um,

608
00:28:42,390 --> 00:28:44,320
if any neighbouring squares,
black makeup,

609
00:28:44,330 --> 00:28:45,240
black square.
So we've,

610
00:28:45,390 --> 00:28:48,630
we've used a very simple program,
we've got a very simple result out,

611
00:28:49,050 --> 00:28:50,400
okay,
let's try a different program.

612
00:28:50,400 --> 00:28:55,350
we can try changing this will get them.
That's a program with one bit different.

613
00:28:55,980 --> 00:28:58,680
Now we get that kind of pattern.
So the question is,

614
00:28:58,681 --> 00:28:59,730
well,
what happens,

615
00:28:59,910 --> 00:29:01,620
you might say,
okay,

616
00:29:01,621 --> 00:29:03,870
if you've got such a trivial program,
it's not surprising,

617
00:29:03,871 --> 00:29:05,430
you're just going to get trevor results 
out.

618
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:11,000
So.
But you can do an experiment to test 

619
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:13,161
that hypothesis and you just say,
let's take all possible programs that 

620
00:29:13,161 --> 00:29:16,080
are 256 possible programs that are based
on these eight bits here.

621
00:29:16,380 --> 00:29:18,240
Let's just take bullets.
Just,

622
00:29:18,550 --> 00:29:20,520
whoops,
let's just take come.

623
00:29:21,930 --> 00:29:26,370
Let's say the first 64 of those programs
and let's just make a.

624
00:29:26,380 --> 00:29:31,380
I'm a go.
Let's just make a table of the results 

625
00:29:31,651 --> 00:29:35,070
that we get by running those first 64 
programs here.

626
00:29:35,460 --> 00:29:38,370
So here we get the result and what you 
see is,

627
00:29:38,400 --> 00:29:43,400
well most of them are pretty trivial.
The likely they started with black cell 

628
00:29:43,400 --> 00:29:43,810
in the middle and it just tools off to 
one side.

629
00:29:44,200 --> 00:29:46,120
Occasionally we get something more 
exciting happening.

630
00:29:46,121 --> 00:29:48,250
Like here's a nice nested pattern that 
we get.

631
00:29:48,520 --> 00:29:50,020
We were to continue it longer.
It would,

632
00:29:50,080 --> 00:29:55,080
it would make a more detailed nesting.
But then my all time favorite science 

633
00:29:56,831 --> 00:30:01,831
discovery.
If you go on and just look at these 

634
00:30:01,831 --> 00:30:02,080
after a while,
you find this one here,

635
00:30:02,110 --> 00:30:05,830
which is rule 30 and this in this 
numbering scheme,

636
00:30:06,100 --> 00:30:07,960
and that's doing something a bit more 
complicated.

637
00:30:08,320 --> 00:30:08,770
You say,
well,

638
00:30:08,780 --> 00:30:10,060
what's going on here?
You know,

639
00:30:10,061 --> 00:30:12,070
we just started off with this very 
simple rule.

640
00:30:12,280 --> 00:30:14,430
LeT's see what happens.
Maybe after a while,

641
00:30:14,630 --> 00:30:16,660
you know,
if we run rule 30 long enough,

642
00:30:16,930 --> 00:30:19,810
it will resolve into something simpler.
SO let's try running it.

643
00:30:19,811 --> 00:30:22,190
Let's say 500 steps.
Um,

644
00:30:22,810 --> 00:30:23,820
and that's,
whoops,

645
00:30:23,830 --> 00:30:26,330
that's the result we get.
Let's say a,

646
00:30:28,750 --> 00:30:30,190
just make it full screen.

647
00:30:32,830 --> 00:30:37,830
Okay?
So aliasing a bit on the project to the 

648
00:30:37,830 --> 00:30:37,830
but,
but um,

649
00:30:37,830 --> 00:30:38,380
you've got the basic idea.
This is a.

650
00:30:38,580 --> 00:30:43,580
So this just started off from one black 
sell at the top and this is what it 

651
00:30:43,580 --> 00:30:47,101
made.
And that's pretty weird because all of 

652
00:30:47,101 --> 00:30:47,101
this is,
you know,

653
00:30:47,101 --> 00:30:50,760
this is a sort of not the way it's 
supposed things are supposed to work 

654
00:30:50,760 --> 00:30:54,331
because what we have here is just that 
little program down there and it makes 

655
00:30:54,331 --> 00:30:58,981
this big complicated pattern here.
And we can see there's a certain amount 

656
00:30:58,981 --> 00:31:00,100
of regularity on one side,
but for example,

657
00:31:00,101 --> 00:31:05,101
the center column of this pattern is for
all practical purposes completely 

658
00:31:05,101 --> 00:31:05,101
around.
In fact,

659
00:31:05,101 --> 00:31:09,601
it was,
we used as the random number generator 

660
00:31:09,601 --> 00:31:09,820
and mathematic or wolfram language for 
many years.

661
00:31:09,821 --> 00:31:13,570
It was recently retired after,
after excellent service because we found

662
00:31:13,571 --> 00:31:15,510
it somewhat more efficient one,
um,

663
00:31:16,600 --> 00:31:17,200
But,
um,

664
00:31:17,660 --> 00:31:19,360
uh,
the,

665
00:31:19,361 --> 00:31:20,140
um,
so,

666
00:31:20,200 --> 00:31:21,340
you know,
what do we learn from this?

667
00:31:21,340 --> 00:31:26,340
What we learned from this is out in the 
computational universe of possible 

668
00:31:26,340 --> 00:31:30,151
programs.
It's possible to get even with very 

669
00:31:30,151 --> 00:31:30,220
simple programs,
very rich,

670
00:31:30,221 --> 00:31:32,710
complicated behavior.
While that's important,

671
00:31:32,711 --> 00:31:37,711
if you're interested in modeling the 
natural world because you might think 

672
00:31:37,711 --> 00:31:41,580
that there are programs that represent 
systems in nature that might work this 

673
00:31:41,580 --> 00:31:45,421
way and so on.
it's also important for technology 

674
00:31:45,421 --> 00:31:45,421
because it says,
okay,

675
00:31:45,421 --> 00:31:47,950
let's say you're trying to find a,
um,

676
00:31:48,250 --> 00:31:53,250
let's say you're trying to find a 
Program that's a good random number 

677
00:31:53,250 --> 00:31:53,250
generator.
How are you going to do that?

678
00:31:53,250 --> 00:31:55,000
While you could start thinking very hard
and you could try and make up,

679
00:31:55,030 --> 00:32:00,030
you know,
you can try and write down all kinds of 

680
00:32:00,030 --> 00:32:02,191
flow charts about how this random number
generator is going to work or you can 

681
00:32:02,191 --> 00:32:02,260
say,
forget that I'm just going to search the

682
00:32:02,261 --> 00:32:07,261
computational universe of possible 
programs and just look for one that 

683
00:32:07,261 --> 00:32:09,040
serves as a good random numBer generator
and this particular case,

684
00:32:09,041 --> 00:32:12,640
after you've searched 30 programs,
you'll find one that makes a good random

685
00:32:12,641 --> 00:32:13,420
number generator.

686
00:32:13,720 --> 00:32:16,480
Why dOes it work?
That's a complicated story.

687
00:32:16,720 --> 00:32:21,720
It's not a story that I think 
necessarily we can really tell very 

688
00:32:21,720 --> 00:32:25,501
well,
but what's important is that this is 

689
00:32:25,501 --> 00:32:25,630
this idea that out in the computational 
universe,

690
00:32:25,631 --> 00:32:30,631
there's a lot of rich,
sophisticated stuff that can be 

691
00:32:30,631 --> 00:32:32,530
essentially mined for our technological 
purposes.

692
00:32:32,531 --> 00:32:37,531
That's the important thing.
Whether we understand how this works is 

693
00:32:37,531 --> 00:32:41,821
a different matter.
I mean it's like when we look at the 

694
00:32:41,821 --> 00:32:41,821
natural world,
the physical world,

695
00:32:41,821 --> 00:32:42,530
we're used to kind of mining things.
You know,

696
00:32:42,710 --> 00:32:47,150
we started using magnets to do magnetic 
stuff long before we understand,

697
00:32:47,180 --> 00:32:49,730
understood the theory of pharaoh 
mannerism and so on.

698
00:32:50,030 --> 00:32:55,030
And so similarly here we can sort of go 
out into the computational universe and 

699
00:32:55,030 --> 00:32:57,680
find stuff that's useful for our 
purposes now.

700
00:32:57,950 --> 00:32:59,190
In fact,
the,

701
00:32:59,280 --> 00:33:04,280
the world of sort of deep learning and 
neural nets and so on as a little bit 

702
00:33:04,280 --> 00:33:05,090
like this,
it uses the trick that there's a certain

703
00:33:05,091 --> 00:33:10,091
degree of differentiability there so you
can kind of home in on let's try and 

704
00:33:10,091 --> 00:33:12,980
find something that's incrementally 
better and for certain kinds of problems

705
00:33:12,981 --> 00:33:14,150
that works pretty well.

706
00:33:14,510 --> 00:33:19,510
I think the thing that we've done a lot,
I've done a lot is just sort of 

707
00:33:19,510 --> 00:33:21,440
exhaustive search and the computational 
universe of possible programs,

708
00:33:21,441 --> 00:33:26,441
just such a trillion programs and try 
and find one that does something 

709
00:33:26,441 --> 00:33:26,760
interesting and useful for you.
Um,

710
00:33:27,380 --> 00:33:29,720
there's a lot of things to say about 
what,

711
00:33:29,721 --> 00:33:30,970
um,
what actually in,

712
00:33:30,971 --> 00:33:33,680
in the such a chilean programs and find 
one that's useful.

713
00:33:33,860 --> 00:33:36,380
Let me show you another example of that.
Um,

714
00:33:36,500 --> 00:33:41,360
let's see.
So I was interested in awhile ago in um,

715
00:33:41,960 --> 00:33:42,980
uh,
the,

716
00:33:42,981 --> 00:33:44,570
I have to look something up here.
Sorry,

717
00:33:44,910 --> 00:33:48,440
I'm in.
I'm a see,

718
00:33:49,190 --> 00:33:54,190
I'm in,
I'm a boolean algebra and in,

719
00:33:55,150 --> 00:33:56,280
um,
uh,

720
00:33:56,320 --> 00:33:59,140
it was interested in,
in the space of all possible mathematics

721
00:33:59,141 --> 00:34:00,470
says,
um,

722
00:34:01,040 --> 00:34:02,580
and ah,
let me just see here.

723
00:34:03,230 --> 00:34:07,970
Uh,
I'm not finding what I wanted to find.

724
00:34:07,971 --> 00:34:09,920
Sorry,
uh,

725
00:34:09,960 --> 00:34:14,960
was a good example.
I should have memorized this but I 

726
00:34:14,960 --> 00:34:14,990
haven't.

727
00:34:15,020 --> 00:34:17,330
So I'm.
Here we go.

728
00:34:17,930 --> 00:34:19,120
There it is.
Um,

729
00:34:20,810 --> 00:34:25,070
so I was interested in,
if you just look at.

730
00:34:25,071 --> 00:34:29,000
So we talked about sort of looking at 
the space of all possible,

731
00:34:29,330 --> 00:34:30,820
um,
uh,

732
00:34:32,240 --> 00:34:37,240
the space of all possible programs.
Another thing you can do is say if 

733
00:34:37,240 --> 00:34:37,580
you're going to invent mathematics from 
nothing,

734
00:34:37,970 --> 00:34:40,550
what possible axiom systems could be 
used in mathematics.

735
00:34:40,551 --> 00:34:45,551
So I was curious where do that again 
might seem like a completely crazy thing

736
00:34:46,191 --> 00:34:47,450
to do.
So just say,

737
00:34:47,451 --> 00:34:50,870
let's just start enumerating axiom 
systems at random and see if we find one

738
00:34:50,871 --> 00:34:55,871
that's interesting and useful,
but it turns out once you have this idea

739
00:34:56,030 --> 00:34:58,760
that out in the computational universe 
of possible programs,

740
00:34:59,090 --> 00:35:01,700
that's actually a lot of low hanging 
fruit to be found.

741
00:35:02,030 --> 00:35:04,250
It turns out you can apply that in lots 
of places.

742
00:35:04,251 --> 00:35:05,930
I mean,
the thing to understand is why?

743
00:35:06,110 --> 00:35:09,020
Why do we not see a lot of engineering 
structures that look like this?

744
00:35:09,021 --> 00:35:14,021
The reason is because our traditional 
model of engineering has been we 

745
00:35:14,021 --> 00:35:18,581
engineer things in a way where we were,
we can foresee what the outcome of our 

746
00:35:18,581 --> 00:35:22,241
engineering steps that are going to be 
and when it comes to something like 

747
00:35:22,241 --> 00:35:26,111
this,
we can find it out in the computational 

748
00:35:26,111 --> 00:35:26,111
universe what we can't readily foresee,
what's going to happen.

749
00:35:26,111 --> 00:35:29,600
We can't do Sort of a step by step 
design of this particular thing.

750
00:35:29,601 --> 00:35:34,601
And so in engineering and human 
engineering as it's been practiced so 

751
00:35:34,601 --> 00:35:38,141
far,
most of it has consisted of building 

752
00:35:38,141 --> 00:35:40,180
things where we can foresee step by step
what the outcome of our engineering it's

753
00:35:40,190 --> 00:35:41,850
going to be.
And we see that in programs,

754
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:47,000
we see that in in other kinds of 
engineering structures and so there's 

755
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:50,901
sort of a different kind of engineering 
which is about mining the computational 

756
00:35:50,901 --> 00:35:54,021
universe of possible programs and it's 
worth realizing there's a lot more that 

757
00:35:54,021 --> 00:35:58,671
can be done a lot more efficiently by 
mining the computational universe of 

758
00:35:58,671 --> 00:36:02,061
possible programs than by just 
constructing things step by step as a 

759
00:36:02,061 --> 00:36:02,061
human.

760
00:36:02,061 --> 00:36:05,660
So for example,
if you look for optimal algorithms for 

761
00:36:05,660 --> 00:36:05,660
things like,
I don't know,

762
00:36:05,660 --> 00:36:09,441
even something like sorting networks,
the optimal sorting networks look very 

763
00:36:09,441 --> 00:36:14,091
complicated.
They're not things that you would 

764
00:36:14,091 --> 00:36:16,040
construct by sort of step by step 
thinking about things with a in a kind 

765
00:36:16,801 --> 00:36:21,750
of a in a kind of typical human way.
And so this,

766
00:36:21,770 --> 00:36:22,950
this idea,
you know,

767
00:36:23,040 --> 00:36:25,680
if you're really going to have 
computation work efficiently,

768
00:36:25,890 --> 00:36:30,890
you are going to end up with these 
programs that are sort of just mined 

769
00:36:30,890 --> 00:36:34,640
from the computational universe and one 
of the issues with mining thing so that 

770
00:36:34,640 --> 00:36:39,290
there this makes use of computation much
more efficiently than a typical thing 

771
00:36:39,361 --> 00:36:40,380
that we might construct.
Now,

772
00:36:40,381 --> 00:36:45,381
one feature of this is it's hard to 
understand what's going on and there's 

773
00:36:45,381 --> 00:36:48,891
actually a fundamental reason for that,
which is in our efforts to sort of 

774
00:36:48,891 --> 00:36:52,371
understand what's going on,
we get to use our brains are computers 

775
00:36:52,371 --> 00:36:54,690
are mathematics or whatever and our goal
is this,

776
00:36:54,870 --> 00:36:59,870
this particular little program that a 
certain amount of computation to work 

777
00:36:59,870 --> 00:36:59,870
out this pattern.

778
00:36:59,870 --> 00:37:02,670
The question is can we kind of outrun 
that computation and say,

779
00:37:02,880 --> 00:37:05,340
oh,
I can tell that actually this particular

780
00:37:05,341 --> 00:37:08,760
bit down here is going to be a black 
black bit a.

781
00:37:08,870 --> 00:37:10,860
You don't have to go and do all that 
computation.

782
00:37:11,280 --> 00:37:13,620
But it turns out that,
and again,

783
00:37:13,621 --> 00:37:15,480
this will maybe as a digression,
which,

784
00:37:15,540 --> 00:37:16,080
which,
um,

785
00:37:16,350 --> 00:37:19,440
there's this phenomenon I called 
computational irresponsibility,

786
00:37:19,650 --> 00:37:24,650
which I think is really common and it's 
a consequence of this thing I call 

787
00:37:24,650 --> 00:37:27,631
principle of computational equivalence.
And that the principle of computational 

788
00:37:27,631 --> 00:37:31,701
equivalents basically says as soon as 
you have a system whose behavior isn't 

789
00:37:31,701 --> 00:37:36,411
fairly easy to analyze,
the chances are that the computation 

790
00:37:36,411 --> 00:37:37,950
it's doing is essentially as 
sophisticated as it could be.

791
00:37:38,460 --> 00:37:43,460
And That has consequences.
Like it implies that the typical thing 

792
00:37:43,460 --> 00:37:46,910
like this will correspond to a universal
computer that you can use to program and

793
00:37:46,911 --> 00:37:47,250
a thing.

794
00:37:47,400 --> 00:37:52,400
It also has the consequence of this 
computational reducibility phenomenon 

795
00:37:52,400 --> 00:37:55,910
that says you can't expect our brains to
be able to outrun the computations that 

796
00:37:55,910 --> 00:38:00,741
are going on inside the system.
If there was computational reduce 

797
00:38:00,741 --> 00:38:04,151
ability,
then we can expect that this thing went 

798
00:38:04,151 --> 00:38:04,860
to a lot of trouble and did a million 
steps of evolution.

799
00:38:05,070 --> 00:38:10,070
But actually just by using our brains,
we can jump ahead and see what the 

800
00:38:10,070 --> 00:38:13,521
answer will be.
Computational irreducible suggest that 

801
00:38:13,521 --> 00:38:16,281
isn't the case.
If we're going to make the most 

802
00:38:16,281 --> 00:38:16,281
efficient use of computational 
resources,

803
00:38:16,281 --> 00:38:20,990
we will inevitably run into 
computational irritability all over the 

804
00:38:20,990 --> 00:38:24,051
place.
It has the consequence that we get the 

805
00:38:24,051 --> 00:38:27,141
situation where we can't readily sort of
foresee and understand what's going to 

806
00:38:27,141 --> 00:38:28,410
happen.
So back to mathematics for a second.

807
00:38:28,620 --> 00:38:31,390
so this is just an axiom system,
um,

808
00:38:31,560 --> 00:38:32,310
that,
uh,

809
00:38:32,640 --> 00:38:37,640
so I looked for all possible look 
through sort of all possible axiom 

810
00:38:37,640 --> 00:38:38,890
systems starting off with the really 
tiny ones.

811
00:38:38,890 --> 00:38:43,890
And I asked the question,
what's the first axiom system that 

812
00:38:43,890 --> 00:38:45,570
corresponds to boolean algebra?
so it turns out this,

813
00:38:45,571 --> 00:38:47,680
this thing here,
this tiny little thing here,

814
00:38:48,230 --> 00:38:50,760
a generates all theorems of boolean 
algebra does it.

815
00:38:50,761 --> 00:38:53,020
It is the simplest axiom for boolean 
algebra.

816
00:38:53,470 --> 00:38:58,470
Now,
something I have to show you this 

817
00:38:58,470 --> 00:38:58,470
because it's a new feature.
You see the,

818
00:38:58,810 --> 00:39:03,810
if I say find equational proof,
let's say I want to prove commuter 

819
00:39:03,810 --> 00:39:06,640
activity of the nand operation.
I'm going to show you something here.

820
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:10,390
This is going to try to generate,
let's see if this works.

821
00:39:10,820 --> 00:39:15,820
And this is going to try to generate an 
automated proof based on that axiom 

822
00:39:15,820 --> 00:39:19,090
system of that result.
So it had 102 steps and the proof.

823
00:39:19,540 --> 00:39:21,760
And um,
let's try and say,

824
00:39:21,761 --> 00:39:22,960
let's look at,
for example,

825
00:39:22,961 --> 00:39:24,820
the proof network here.
Actually,

826
00:39:24,821 --> 00:39:27,270
let's look at the proof dataset.
Um,

827
00:39:27,420 --> 00:39:28,780
no,
that's not what I wanted.

828
00:39:29,720 --> 00:39:31,070
Oh,
I should learn how to use the,

829
00:39:31,970 --> 00:39:34,410
the,
um,

830
00:39:36,900 --> 00:39:40,520
let's see what I want is the,
um,

831
00:39:41,390 --> 00:39:42,610
you know,
proof dataset.

832
00:39:42,611 --> 00:39:43,720
There we go.
Very good.

833
00:39:44,230 --> 00:39:47,470
Okay,
so this is actually,

834
00:39:47,471 --> 00:39:48,460
let's,
let's say,

835
00:39:48,920 --> 00:39:49,720
uh,
first of all,

836
00:39:49,721 --> 00:39:51,970
let's say the proof graph.
Okay?

837
00:39:51,971 --> 00:39:55,480
So this is going to show me the,
how that proof was done.

838
00:39:55,540 --> 00:39:59,650
So there are a bunch of lemons that got 
approved and from those lemars,

839
00:39:59,651 --> 00:40:02,320
those cameras were combined that 
eventually approved the result.

840
00:40:02,890 --> 00:40:04,080
So let's,
let's take a look at the.

841
00:40:04,120 --> 00:40:05,980
Let's take a look at what some of those 
lenders where,

842
00:40:08,560 --> 00:40:09,340
okay,
so here's,

843
00:40:09,370 --> 00:40:11,260
here's the result.
So after,

844
00:40:11,261 --> 00:40:14,050
so it goes through and these are various
lemars it's using,

845
00:40:14,051 --> 00:40:18,550
and eventually after many pages of 
nonsense it will get to the result.

846
00:40:18,820 --> 00:40:19,780
Okay?
Each one of these,

847
00:40:19,781 --> 00:40:21,410
some of these llamas are kind of 
complicated.

848
00:40:21,411 --> 00:40:22,340
The,
that's uh,

849
00:40:22,420 --> 00:40:23,330
that's that lama.

850
00:40:23,400 --> 00:40:25,800
It's a pretty complicated lemme etc.
Etc.

851
00:40:25,870 --> 00:40:30,870
Etc.
So you might ask what on earth is going 

852
00:40:30,870 --> 00:40:30,870
on here?
And the answer is,

853
00:40:30,870 --> 00:40:34,741
so I first generated version of this 
proof 20 years ago and I tried to 

854
00:40:34,741 --> 00:40:38,191
understand what was going on and I 
completely failed and it's sort of 

855
00:40:38,191 --> 00:40:39,360
embarrassing because this is supposed to
be approved for.

856
00:40:39,361 --> 00:40:40,420
It's supposed to be,
you know,

857
00:40:40,421 --> 00:40:44,380
demonstrating some results.
And what we realize is that,

858
00:40:44,650 --> 00:40:49,650
you know,
what does it mean to have a proof of 

859
00:40:49,650 --> 00:40:49,650
something?
What does it mean to explain how a thing

860
00:40:49,650 --> 00:40:50,460
is done?
You know,

861
00:40:50,510 --> 00:40:55,510
what,
what is the purpose of a proof sort of 

862
00:40:55,510 --> 00:40:56,170
proof is basically to let humans 
understand why something is true.

863
00:40:56,740 --> 00:40:58,570
And so for example,
if you go to,

864
00:40:58,571 --> 00:41:02,350
um,
let's say we go to wolf alpha and we do,

865
00:41:02,890 --> 00:41:07,890
you know,
some random thing where we say let's do 

866
00:41:07,890 --> 00:41:10,360
an integral of something or another,
it will be able to very quickly.

867
00:41:10,630 --> 00:41:15,630
In fact,
it Will take it one milliseconds 

868
00:41:15,630 --> 00:41:15,630
internally to work out the answer to 
that integral,

869
00:41:15,630 --> 00:41:17,620
okay?
But then somebody who's wants to hand in

870
00:41:17,621 --> 00:41:19,240
a piece of homework or something like 
that,

871
00:41:19,480 --> 00:41:22,810
needs to explain why is this true?
Okay,

872
00:41:23,200 --> 00:41:26,560
well,
we have this handy step by step solution

873
00:41:27,040 --> 00:41:32,040
thing here,
which explains why it's true.

874
00:41:32,500 --> 00:41:37,500
Now,
the thing I should admit about the step 

875
00:41:37,500 --> 00:41:37,500
by step solutIon is it's completely 
fake.

876
00:41:37,500 --> 00:41:40,250
That is the steps that are described in 
the step by step solution.

877
00:41:40,251 --> 00:41:42,980
I have absolutely nothing to do with the
way that internally,

878
00:41:42,981 --> 00:41:47,981
that integral was computed.
These are steps created purely for the 

879
00:41:47,981 --> 00:41:51,230
purpose of telling a story to humans 
about why the center came out the way it

880
00:41:51,231 --> 00:41:54,250
did and now what we're seeing and so 
that's a.

881
00:41:54,380 --> 00:41:56,030
So that's one thing is knowing the 
answer.

882
00:41:56,031 --> 00:42:01,031
The other thing is being able to tell a 
story about why the answer work that 

883
00:42:01,031 --> 00:42:01,031
way.

884
00:42:01,031 --> 00:42:02,420
Well,
what we see here is this is a proof,

885
00:42:02,930 --> 00:42:07,930
but it was an automatically generated 
proof and it's a really lousy story for 

886
00:42:07,930 --> 00:42:11,951
us humans.
I mean if it turned out that one of 

887
00:42:11,951 --> 00:42:14,801
these theorems here was one that had 
been proved by gauss or something and 

888
00:42:14,801 --> 00:42:16,790
appeared in all the textbooks,
we wouldn't be much happier because then

889
00:42:16,791 --> 00:42:21,230
we would start to have a kind of human 
representable story about what was going

890
00:42:21,231 --> 00:42:26,231
on.
Instead we just get a bunch of machine 

891
00:42:26,231 --> 00:42:27,791
generated Lammas that we can't 
understand that we can't kind of wrap 

892
00:42:27,791 --> 00:42:30,560
our brains around and it's sorta the 
same thing that's going on in.

893
00:42:30,880 --> 00:42:33,530
When we look at when is neuron that's 
we're seeing,

894
00:42:33,531 --> 00:42:34,460
you know,
when we were looking,

895
00:42:34,461 --> 00:42:37,100
wherever it was at the innards of that 
neuron that.

896
00:42:37,370 --> 00:42:38,150
And we say,
well,

897
00:42:38,151 --> 00:42:40,580
how is it figuring out that that's a 
picture of a panda?

898
00:42:40,910 --> 00:42:43,250
Well,
the answer is it decided that,

899
00:42:43,420 --> 00:42:45,140
you know,
if we humans were saying,

900
00:42:45,141 --> 00:42:46,940
how would you figure out if it's a 
picture of a panda,

901
00:42:46,941 --> 00:42:50,030
we might say,
well look and see if it has eyes.

902
00:42:50,031 --> 00:42:55,031
That's a clue for whether it's an animal
look and see if it's looks like it's 

903
00:42:55,031 --> 00:42:58,151
kind of round and furry and things 
that's a version of whether it's a 

904
00:42:58,151 --> 00:42:58,390
pander and et cetera,
et cetera,

905
00:42:58,391 --> 00:43:03,391
et cetera.
But what it's doing is it learned to a 

906
00:43:03,391 --> 00:43:03,391
bunch of criteria for,
you know,

907
00:43:03,391 --> 00:43:04,880
is it a pandora?
Is it one of 10,000

908
00:43:04,881 --> 00:43:06,860
other possible things that it could have
recognized?

909
00:43:07,130 --> 00:43:12,130
And it learns those criteria in a way 
that was somehow optimal based on the 

910
00:43:12,130 --> 00:43:16,991
training that it got and so on.
But it learned things which were 

911
00:43:16,991 --> 00:43:19,751
distinctions which are different from 
the distinctions that we humans make in 

912
00:43:19,751 --> 00:43:20,930
the language that we as humans use.

913
00:43:21,170 --> 00:43:22,940
And so in some sense,
you know,

914
00:43:22,941 --> 00:43:24,590
when,
when we start talking about,

915
00:43:24,591 --> 00:43:25,850
well,
describe a picture,

916
00:43:26,090 --> 00:43:28,700
we have a certain human language for 
describing that picture.

917
00:43:28,910 --> 00:43:31,790
We have in our human,
in typical human languages,

918
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:35,570
we have maybe 30 to 50,000
words that we use to describe things.

919
00:43:35,840 --> 00:43:40,840
Those words are words that have sort of 
evolved as being useful for describing 

920
00:43:40,840 --> 00:43:44,360
the world that we live in when it comes 
to this neural net.

921
00:43:44,600 --> 00:43:46,610
It could be using,
it could say,

922
00:43:46,611 --> 00:43:47,640
well,
uh,

923
00:43:47,730 --> 00:43:50,210
the,
the words that it is effectively learnt,

924
00:43:50,540 --> 00:43:53,900
which allow it to make distinctions 
about what's going on in the,

925
00:43:54,170 --> 00:43:59,170
in the analysis that it's doing it as 
effectively invented words that describe

926
00:43:59,961 --> 00:44:04,961
distinctions,
but those words have nothing to do with 

927
00:44:04,961 --> 00:44:05,960
our historically invented words that 
exist in our languages.

928
00:44:06,110 --> 00:44:07,910
So it's kind of an interesting situation
that,

929
00:44:08,120 --> 00:44:10,340
that it is,
its way of thinking,

930
00:44:10,341 --> 00:44:10,790
so to speak.

931
00:44:10,790 --> 00:44:11,270
if you say,
well,

932
00:44:11,271 --> 00:44:13,850
what's it thinking about?
How do we describe what it's thinking?

933
00:44:14,090 --> 00:44:17,420
That's a tough thing to answer because 
just like with the,

934
00:44:17,630 --> 00:44:19,670
with the automated theorem,
we're,

935
00:44:19,880 --> 00:44:23,090
we're sort of stuck having to say,
well,

936
00:44:23,870 --> 00:44:28,870
we can't really tell a human story 
because the things that had invented a 

937
00:44:28,870 --> 00:44:30,230
things for which we don't even have 
wordS in our languages and so on.

938
00:44:31,140 --> 00:44:36,140
Okay.
So one thing to reAlize is in this kind 

939
00:44:36,140 --> 00:44:38,430
of space of sort of all possible 
computations,

940
00:44:38,670 --> 00:44:40,620
that a lot of stuff out there that can 
be done,

941
00:44:40,830 --> 00:44:45,830
there's this coat kind of ocean of 
sophisticated computation and then the 

942
00:44:46,400 --> 00:44:50,190
question that we have to ask for us 
humans is,

943
00:44:50,250 --> 00:44:52,620
okay,
how do we make use of all of that stuff?

944
00:44:53,160 --> 00:44:57,300
So what we've got kind of on the one 
hand is we've got the things we know how

945
00:44:57,301 --> 00:45:01,440
to think about human languages,
our way of describing things,

946
00:45:01,441 --> 00:45:02,880
our way of talking about stuff.

947
00:45:02,880 --> 00:45:04,560
That's the One,
one side of things.

948
00:45:04,770 --> 00:45:09,770
The other side of things we have is this
very powerful kind of ocean of 

949
00:45:09,770 --> 00:45:11,550
computation on the other side where lots
of things can happen.

950
00:45:11,970 --> 00:45:15,900
So the question is how do we make use of
this sort of ocean of computation in the

951
00:45:15,901 --> 00:45:19,890
best possible way for our human purposes
and building technology and so on.

952
00:45:20,370 --> 00:45:23,280
And So the way I see,
you know,

953
00:45:23,310 --> 00:45:28,310
my kind of a part of what I've spent a 
very long time doing this kind of 

954
00:45:28,591 --> 00:45:32,130
building a language that allows us to 
take human thinking.

955
00:45:32,131 --> 00:45:37,131
On the one hand and describe and sort of
provide a sort of computational 

956
00:45:38,191 --> 00:45:43,191
communication language that allows us to
get the benefit of what's possible over 

957
00:45:43,191 --> 00:45:47,781
in the sort of ocean of computation in a
way that's rooted in what we humans 

958
00:45:48,121 --> 00:45:53,121
actually want to do.
And so I kind of view or from language 

959
00:45:53,121 --> 00:45:55,290
as being sort of an attempt to make a 
bridge between.

960
00:45:55,290 --> 00:45:56,010
So,
you know,

961
00:45:56,100 --> 00:45:58,410
on the one hand there's all possible 
computations.

962
00:45:58,770 --> 00:46:03,770
On the other hand,
there's things we think we want to do 

963
00:46:03,770 --> 00:46:06,800
and I view often language languages 
being my best attempt right now to make 

964
00:46:07,561 --> 00:46:12,561
a way to take our sort of human 
computational thinking and be able to 

965
00:46:13,651 --> 00:46:15,630
actually implement it.
So in a sense,

966
00:46:15,631 --> 00:46:18,780
iT's a language which works in two on 
two sides.

967
00:46:18,781 --> 00:46:23,781
It's both a language where you as a,
uh,

968
00:46:24,430 --> 00:46:26,700
as uh,
the machine can understand,

969
00:46:26,701 --> 00:46:31,701
okay,
it's looking at this and that's what 

970
00:46:31,701 --> 00:46:31,701
it's going to compute.
But on the other hand,

971
00:46:31,701 --> 00:46:35,781
it's also a language for us humans to 
think about things and computational 

972
00:46:35,781 --> 00:46:35,781
terms.
So,

973
00:46:35,781 --> 00:46:37,190
you know,
if I go and I,

974
00:46:37,220 --> 00:46:38,490
I don't know,
one of these,

975
00:46:38,550 --> 00:46:43,550
one of these things that I'm doing here,
whatever it is that this wasn't that 

976
00:46:43,550 --> 00:46:43,550
exciting but,
but,

977
00:46:43,550 --> 00:46:43,860
um,
you know,

978
00:46:43,861 --> 00:46:48,780
find shortest tour of the geo position 
of a capital cities in south America.

979
00:46:49,170 --> 00:46:54,170
That is a language that's a 
representation or a precise language of 

980
00:46:54,170 --> 00:46:58,311
something.
And the idea is that that's a language 

981
00:46:58,311 --> 00:47:01,460
which we humans can find useful in 
thinking about things in computational 

982
00:47:01,460 --> 00:47:06,231
terms.
It also happens to be a language that 

983
00:47:06,231 --> 00:47:06,231
the machine can immediately understand 
and execute.

984
00:47:06,570 --> 00:47:08,550
And so I think this is sort of a 
general,

985
00:47:08,690 --> 00:47:10,800
you know,
when I think about ai in general,

986
00:47:11,070 --> 00:47:11,910
the,
you know,

987
00:47:11,911 --> 00:47:14,670
what is the sort of,
what's the overall problem?

988
00:47:14,671 --> 00:47:16,830
Well,
part of the overall problem is so how do

989
00:47:16,831 --> 00:47:19,080
we tell the ais what to do,
so to speak.

990
00:47:19,410 --> 00:47:21,390
There's this very powerful,
you know,

991
00:47:21,420 --> 00:47:26,420
this sort of ocean of computation is 
what we get to mine for purposes of 

992
00:47:26,420 --> 00:47:30,351
building ai kinds of things.
But then the question is how do we tell 

993
00:47:30,351 --> 00:47:34,170
ais what to do and what I see,
what I've tried to do with wolfram 

994
00:47:34,691 --> 00:47:39,691
language is to provide a,
a way of kind of accessing that 

995
00:47:39,821 --> 00:47:44,821
computation and sort of making use of 
the knowledge that our civilization has 

996
00:47:45,401 --> 00:47:49,030
accumulated and because that's the,
you know,

997
00:47:49,300 --> 00:47:54,300
there's the general computation on,
on this side and there's the specific 

998
00:47:54,300 --> 00:47:58,321
things that we humans have thought about
and the question is to make use of the 

999
00:47:58,321 --> 00:48:01,960
things that we've thought about to do,
do things that we care about doing.

1000
00:48:01,960 --> 00:48:06,960
Actually,
if you're interested in these kinds of 

1001
00:48:06,960 --> 00:48:08,851
things.
I happen to just write a blog post last 

1002
00:48:08,851 --> 00:48:10,550
couple of days ago.
It's kind of a funny blog posts.

1003
00:48:10,551 --> 00:48:11,470
It's about,
um,

1004
00:48:11,820 --> 00:48:15,240
well you can see the title there.
It came because a friend of mine has,

1005
00:48:15,430 --> 00:48:20,430
has this crazy project to put little,
little sort of a desks or something 

1006
00:48:22,060 --> 00:48:22,690
that,
um,

1007
00:48:22,720 --> 00:48:26,650
should represent kind of the best 
achievements of human civilization,

1008
00:48:26,651 --> 00:48:28,090
so to speak,
to send out.

1009
00:48:28,160 --> 00:48:33,160
It's,
it's hitchhiking on various spacecraft 

1010
00:48:33,160 --> 00:48:35,020
that are going out into the solar system
in the next little while.

1011
00:48:35,021 --> 00:48:38,260
And the question is what to put on this 
little desk that kind of represents,

1012
00:48:38,500 --> 00:48:40,930
you know,
the achievements of civilization.

1013
00:48:40,940 --> 00:48:43,390
It's kind of,
it's kind of depressing when you go back

1014
00:48:43,391 --> 00:48:44,620
and you look at what,
um,

1015
00:48:44,800 --> 00:48:46,900
what people have tried to do on this 
before.

1016
00:48:47,230 --> 00:48:51,430
And I'm realizing how hard it is to tell
even whether something is an artifact or

1017
00:48:51,431 --> 00:48:51,820
not.

1018
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:53,710
um,
but this is a,

1019
00:48:53,920 --> 00:48:55,080
this was sort of a,
um,

1020
00:48:55,340 --> 00:48:56,020
uh,
that's a good one.

1021
00:48:56,021 --> 00:48:57,280
That's from 11,000
years ago.

1022
00:48:57,281 --> 00:48:58,210
Can you.
The question is,

1023
00:48:58,211 --> 00:49:01,930
can you figure out what on earth it is 
and what it means?

1024
00:49:01,940 --> 00:49:03,370
And this is,
uh,

1025
00:49:04,440 --> 00:49:04,840
uh,
but,

1026
00:49:04,841 --> 00:49:05,770
but,
so what,

1027
00:49:05,830 --> 00:49:08,960
what's relevant about this is the,
this,

1028
00:49:08,970 --> 00:49:12,730
this whole question of there are things 
that are out there and the computational

1029
00:49:12,731 --> 00:49:14,830
universe.
And you know,

1030
00:49:14,831 --> 00:49:17,290
when we think about extraterrestrial 
intelligence,

1031
00:49:17,470 --> 00:49:22,470
I find it kind of interesting that 
artificial intelligence is our first 

1032
00:49:22,470 --> 00:49:27,301
example of an alien intelligence.
We don't happen to have found what we 

1033
00:49:27,301 --> 00:49:28,690
view as extraterrestrial intelligence 
right now,

1034
00:49:28,691 --> 00:49:33,691
but we are in the process of building 
pretty decent version of an alien 

1035
00:49:33,691 --> 00:49:34,630
intelligence here.
And the question is,

1036
00:49:34,840 --> 00:49:37,420
if you ask questions like,
well,

1037
00:49:37,480 --> 00:49:38,860
you know,
what is it thinking?

1038
00:49:38,890 --> 00:49:43,890
Is it,
does it have a purpose and what it's 

1039
00:49:43,890 --> 00:49:45,601
doing and so on,
and you're confronted with things like 

1040
00:49:45,601 --> 00:49:45,601
this.

1041
00:49:45,601 --> 00:49:46,840
It's very,
we can kind of do a test run of,

1042
00:49:47,200 --> 00:49:48,070
you know,
what's,

1043
00:49:48,100 --> 00:49:52,090
what's its purpose?
What is it trying to do in a way that is

1044
00:49:52,091 --> 00:49:54,460
very similar to the kinds of questions 
you would ask about,

1045
00:49:54,490 --> 00:49:57,190
about extraterrestrial intelligence.
But in any case,

1046
00:49:57,191 --> 00:49:57,730
the,
the,

1047
00:49:57,731 --> 00:49:58,780
um,
uh,

1048
00:49:59,010 --> 00:50:04,010
the,
the main point is that I see there's 

1049
00:50:04,010 --> 00:50:05,890
sort of ocean of computation,
there's the,

1050
00:50:05,980 --> 00:50:09,280
let's describe what we actually want to 
do with that ocean of computation.

1051
00:50:09,610 --> 00:50:10,720
And that's where,
you know,

1052
00:50:10,721 --> 00:50:12,160
that's one of the primary problems we 
have now.

1053
00:50:12,161 --> 00:50:13,170
People talk about,
you know,

1054
00:50:13,240 --> 00:50:16,390
ai and what is ai going to allow us to 
automate.

1055
00:50:16,840 --> 00:50:21,840
And my basic answer to that would be 
we'll be able to automate everything 

1056
00:50:21,840 --> 00:50:26,041
that we can describe.
The problem is it's not clear what we 

1057
00:50:26,041 --> 00:50:27,140
can describe or put another way,
you know,

1058
00:50:27,141 --> 00:50:30,530
you imagine various jobs and people are 
doing things that are repeated judgment,

1059
00:50:30,531 --> 00:50:35,531
jobs,
things like this there where we can 

1060
00:50:35,531 --> 00:50:35,531
readily automate those things.

1061
00:50:35,531 --> 00:50:37,520
But the thing that we can't really 
automate is saying,

1062
00:50:37,521 --> 00:50:39,620
well,
what are we trying to do that is,

1063
00:50:39,621 --> 00:50:41,960
what are our goals?
Because in a sense,

1064
00:50:42,140 --> 00:50:43,880
when,
when we see one of these systems,

1065
00:50:43,881 --> 00:50:44,660
you know,
let's say,

1066
00:50:44,870 --> 00:50:47,280
let's say it's a,
it's a cellular automaton here.

1067
00:50:47,390 --> 00:50:48,620
Okay?
The question is,

1068
00:50:48,621 --> 00:50:50,840
what is the cellular automaton trying to
do?

1069
00:50:51,470 --> 00:50:56,470
Maybe I can.
Maybe I'll give you another cellular 

1070
00:50:56,470 --> 00:50:56,470
automaton that there's a little bit more
exciting here.

1071
00:50:56,470 --> 00:50:57,560
Let's do this one.
So the,

1072
00:50:57,561 --> 00:51:02,561
the um,
the question is what is the cellular 

1073
00:51:02,561 --> 00:51:02,610
automaton trying to do?
You know,

1074
00:51:02,670 --> 00:51:05,840
it's got this whole big structure here 
and things are happening with it.

1075
00:51:05,841 --> 00:51:10,841
We can go,
we can run it for a couple of thousand 

1076
00:51:10,841 --> 00:51:10,841
steps.
We can ask.

1077
00:51:10,841 --> 00:51:12,080
So nice example of kind of 
undecidability and action.

1078
00:51:12,320 --> 00:51:13,870
What's going to happen here?
This is kind of the whole thing.

1079
00:51:13,910 --> 00:51:16,490
Problem is this kind of holt,
what's it going to do?

1080
00:51:16,750 --> 00:51:19,040
A,
there's computational or disability that

1081
00:51:19,041 --> 00:51:21,620
we actually can't tell.
There's the case where we know this is a

1082
00:51:21,621 --> 00:51:24,410
universal computer.
In fact eventually,

1083
00:51:24,440 --> 00:51:29,440
well,
I wouldn't even spell it for you if I 

1084
00:51:29,440 --> 00:51:29,440
went on long enough.
It would,

1085
00:51:29,440 --> 00:51:31,280
it would go into some kind of cycle.
But,

1086
00:51:31,281 --> 00:51:36,281
um,
we can ask what is this thing trying to 

1087
00:51:36,281 --> 00:51:36,281
do?
What is it,

1088
00:51:36,281 --> 00:51:36,281
you know,
is it,

1089
00:51:36,290 --> 00:51:37,870
what's it thinking about?
What's it,

1090
00:51:38,660 --> 00:51:40,460
what's its goal,
what's its purpose?

1091
00:51:41,000 --> 00:51:46,000
And you know,
we get very quickly and in a big mess 

1092
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:46,000
thinking about those kinds of things.
I've,

1093
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:46,000
I've,
um,

1094
00:51:46,220 --> 00:51:51,220
one of the things that comes out of this
principle of computational equivalence 

1095
00:51:51,220 --> 00:51:54,580
is thinking about what kinds of things 
have a,

1096
00:51:55,170 --> 00:51:57,740
are capable of,
of sophisticated computation.

1097
00:51:57,741 --> 00:52:00,890
So,
so I mentioned a while back here,

1098
00:52:01,570 --> 00:52:06,570
sort of my personal history with wealth 
malware of having thought about doing 

1099
00:52:06,570 --> 00:52:09,851
something like wealth now for when I was
a kid and then believing that you sort 

1100
00:52:09,851 --> 00:52:10,460
of had to build a brain to make that 
possible and so on.

1101
00:52:10,880 --> 00:52:15,880
And one of the things that I then 
thought was that there was some kind of 

1102
00:52:15,880 --> 00:52:19,931
bright line between what is intelligent 
and what is merely computational,

1103
00:52:20,781 --> 00:52:25,781
so to speak.
In other words that there was something 

1104
00:52:25,781 --> 00:52:25,781
which is like,
oh,

1105
00:52:25,781 --> 00:52:28,340
we've got this great thing that we 
humans have that is intelligence and all

1106
00:52:28,341 --> 00:52:31,630
these things in nature and so on.
And all the stuff that's going on there.

1107
00:52:31,760 --> 00:52:34,280
It's just computation or it's just,
you know,

1108
00:52:34,281 --> 00:52:36,320
things operating according to rules 
that's different.

1109
00:52:36,321 --> 00:52:38,690
There's some bright line distinction 
between these things.

1110
00:52:39,020 --> 00:52:44,020
Well,
I think the thing that came about after 

1111
00:52:44,020 --> 00:52:47,081
I looked at all these cellular automata 
and all kinds of other things like that 

1112
00:52:47,081 --> 00:52:50,240
is I sort of came up with this principle
of computational equivalence,

1113
00:52:50,560 --> 00:52:53,570
a idea which we've now got quite a lot 
of evidence for,

1114
00:52:53,571 --> 00:52:55,670
which I talked about people are 
interested in.

1115
00:52:56,090 --> 00:53:01,090
But that basically there isn't a,
that once you reach a certain level of 

1116
00:53:02,630 --> 00:53:05,090
computational sophistication,
everything is equivalent.

1117
00:53:05,540 --> 00:53:10,540
And that means that that implies that 
there really isn't a bright line 

1118
00:53:10,540 --> 00:53:11,180
distinction between,
for example,

1119
00:53:11,181 --> 00:53:16,181
the computation is going on in our 
brains and the computations going on in 

1120
00:53:16,181 --> 00:53:18,320
this simple cellular automata and so on.
And that essentially philosophical point

1121
00:53:18,590 --> 00:53:23,590
is what actually got me to start trying 
to build both from alpha because I 

1122
00:53:23,590 --> 00:53:23,590
realized that,
gosh,

1123
00:53:23,590 --> 00:53:28,241
you know,
I've been looking for this sort of the 

1124
00:53:28,241 --> 00:53:30,370
magic bullets of intelligence and I just
decided probably there isn't one and 

1125
00:53:30,370 --> 00:53:34,311
actually it's all just computation.
And so that means we can actually in 

1126
00:53:34,311 --> 00:53:36,660
practice build something that doeS this 
kind of intelligent like thing.

1127
00:53:37,080 --> 00:53:42,080
And so that's what I think is the case,
is that there really isn't sort of a 

1128
00:53:42,080 --> 00:53:44,340
bright line distinction and that has,
that has more extreme consequences.

1129
00:53:44,341 --> 00:53:45,960
Like people will say things like,
you know,

1130
00:53:46,140 --> 00:53:47,760
the weAther has a mind of its own.

1131
00:53:48,180 --> 00:53:49,770
Okay.
Sounds kind of silly.

1132
00:53:49,771 --> 00:53:52,290
Sounds kind of animistic primitive and 
so on.

1133
00:53:52,291 --> 00:53:57,291
But in fact,
the fluid dynamics of the weather is as 

1134
00:53:57,291 --> 00:54:01,140
computationally sophisticated as the 
stuff that goes on in our brains.

1135
00:54:01,650 --> 00:54:03,870
But we can start askIng,
but then you say,

1136
00:54:03,871 --> 00:54:06,110
but the weather doesn't have a purpose.
You know,

1137
00:54:06,150 --> 00:54:07,800
what's the purpose of the weather?
Well,

1138
00:54:07,830 --> 00:54:12,830
you know,
maybe the weather is trying to equalize 

1139
00:54:12,830 --> 00:54:12,830
the temperature between the,
you know,

1140
00:54:12,830 --> 00:54:16,940
the,
the north pole and the tropics or 

1141
00:54:16,940 --> 00:54:16,940
something.
And then we have to say,

1142
00:54:16,940 --> 00:54:17,910
well,
but that's not a purpose.

1143
00:54:17,911 --> 00:54:19,560
And the way that we think about 
purposes,

1144
00:54:19,561 --> 00:54:21,000
that's just,
you know,

1145
00:54:21,150 --> 00:54:26,150
and we get very confused.
And in the end what we realized is when 

1146
00:54:26,150 --> 00:54:26,150
we're talking about things like 
purposes,

1147
00:54:26,520 --> 00:54:31,520
we have to have this kind of chain of 
provenance that goes back to humans and 

1148
00:54:31,651 --> 00:54:33,300
human history and all that kind of 
thing.

1149
00:54:33,720 --> 00:54:38,720
And I think it's the same type of thing 
when we talk about computation and ai 

1150
00:54:38,720 --> 00:54:39,750
and so on.
The thing that we.

1151
00:54:39,840 --> 00:54:43,260
This question of sort of purpose goals,
things like this,

1152
00:54:43,590 --> 00:54:47,910
that's the thing which is intrinsically 
human and not something that we can ever

1153
00:54:47,911 --> 00:54:52,911
sort of automatically generate.
It makes no sense to talk about 

1154
00:54:52,911 --> 00:54:53,460
automatically generating it.
Because these computational systems,

1155
00:54:53,461 --> 00:54:55,220
they do all kinds of stuff.
You know,

1156
00:54:55,230 --> 00:54:57,990
we can say they've got a purpose.
We can attribute purposes to them,

1157
00:54:57,991 --> 00:54:58,660
et cetera,
et cetera,

1158
00:54:58,661 --> 00:54:59,890
et cetera.
But you know,

1159
00:54:59,910 --> 00:55:04,910
ultimately it's sort of the human thread
of purpose that we have to have to deal 

1160
00:55:04,910 --> 00:55:04,950
with.
So that means,

1161
00:55:04,951 --> 00:55:09,951
for example,
when we talk about ais and we were 

1162
00:55:09,951 --> 00:55:09,951
interested in things like,
so how do we tell,

1163
00:55:09,951 --> 00:55:10,190
you know,
like,

1164
00:55:10,230 --> 00:55:14,190
like we'd like to be able to tell.
We talk about ai ethics for example.

1165
00:55:14,430 --> 00:55:17,580
We'd like to be able to make a statement
to the ais like,

1166
00:55:17,840 --> 00:55:19,210
you know,
please be nIce to,

1167
00:55:19,250 --> 00:55:22,940
to us humans and that's a,
you know,

1168
00:55:23,010 --> 00:55:26,370
that's something.
So one of the issues there is so,

1169
00:55:26,371 --> 00:55:31,371
so talking about that kind of thing,
I'm one of the issues is how are we 

1170
00:55:31,441 --> 00:55:34,560
going to make a statement like be nice 
to us humans.

1171
00:55:34,830 --> 00:55:39,830
What's the,
how are we going to explain that to an 

1172
00:55:39,830 --> 00:55:40,560
ai?
And this is where again,

1173
00:55:40,850 --> 00:55:44,430
you know my,
my efforts to build a language,

1174
00:55:44,431 --> 00:55:49,431
a computational communication language 
that bridges the world of what we humans

1175
00:55:49,441 --> 00:55:53,520
think about and the world of what is 
possible and computation is important.

1176
00:55:53,850 --> 00:55:58,850
And So one of the things I've been 
interested in is actually building what 

1177
00:55:58,850 --> 00:56:01,791
I call a symbolic discourse language 
that can be a general representation for

1178
00:56:02,100 --> 00:56:05,040
a sort of the kinds of things that we 
might want to,

1179
00:56:05,360 --> 00:56:07,410
uh,
put in,

1180
00:56:07,740 --> 00:56:12,740
uh,
that we might want to say and things 

1181
00:56:12,740 --> 00:56:12,740
like be nice to humans.

1182
00:56:12,740 --> 00:56:13,560
So sort of a little bit of background to
that.

1183
00:56:13,710 --> 00:56:14,410
So you know,
in,

1184
00:56:14,411 --> 00:56:17,430
in the modern world,
people are keen on smart contracts.

1185
00:56:17,730 --> 00:56:20,210
They often think of them has been deeply
tied into blockchain,

1186
00:56:20,220 --> 00:56:21,630
which I don't think it's really quite 
right.

1187
00:56:22,100 --> 00:56:27,100
The important thing about smart 
contracts is it's a way of having sort 

1188
00:56:27,100 --> 00:56:30,910
of an agreement between parties which 
can be executed automatically.

1189
00:56:31,210 --> 00:56:33,040
And that agreement may be,
you know,

1190
00:56:33,041 --> 00:56:37,210
you may choose to sort of anchor that 
agreement on blockchain.

1191
00:56:37,211 --> 00:56:42,211
You may not,
but the whole point is you have to 

1192
00:56:42,211 --> 00:56:42,211
watch,
you know,

1193
00:56:42,211 --> 00:56:45,390
when people like legal contracts,
they write them in an approximation to 

1194
00:56:45,390 --> 00:56:49,171
english.
They write them in legal ease typically 

1195
00:56:49,171 --> 00:56:49,171
because they're trying to write them in 
something a little bit more precise than

1196
00:56:49,171 --> 00:56:52,960
regular english.
But the limitiNg case of that is to make

1197
00:56:53,230 --> 00:56:58,230
a symbolic discourse language in which 
you can write the contract and code 

1198
00:56:58,230 --> 00:56:58,230
basically.

1199
00:56:58,570 --> 00:57:03,570
And the.
I've been very interested in using 

1200
00:57:03,570 --> 00:57:06,391
wolfram language to do that because in 
wolfram language we have a language 

1201
00:57:06,391 --> 00:57:09,811
which can describe things about the 
world and we can talk about the kinds of

1202
00:57:09,881 --> 00:57:12,610
things that people actually talk about 
in contracts and so on.

1203
00:57:13,220 --> 00:57:16,090
We're most of the way there to being 
able to do that.

1204
00:57:17,140 --> 00:57:19,780
And then when you start thinking about 
that,

1205
00:57:19,781 --> 00:57:21,040
you start thInking about,
okay,

1206
00:57:21,160 --> 00:57:24,620
so we've got this language to describe 
things that we,

1207
00:57:24,710 --> 00:57:28,680
that we care about in the world.
And so when it comes to things like tell

1208
00:57:28,720 --> 00:57:33,720
the ais to be nice to humans,
we can imagine using both language to 

1209
00:57:33,861 --> 00:57:38,861
sort of build an ai constitution that 
says this is how the ai is supposed to 

1210
00:57:38,861 --> 00:57:40,930
work.
But when we talk about sort of just the,

1211
00:57:40,931 --> 00:57:42,950
the untethered,
untethered,

1212
00:57:42,951 --> 00:57:46,820
ai doesn't have any particular,
it's just going to do what it does.

1213
00:57:47,090 --> 00:57:48,750
And if we want it to,
you know,

1214
00:57:48,800 --> 00:57:51,470
if we want to somehow align it with 
human purposes,

1215
00:57:51,590 --> 00:57:55,460
we have to have some way to sort of talk
to the ai and that's,

1216
00:57:55,600 --> 00:57:56,750
that's uh,
you know,

1217
00:57:56,770 --> 00:58:00,260
I view my efforts to bilbo from language
as,

1218
00:58:00,450 --> 00:58:01,360
as way to do that.
I mean,

1219
00:58:01,361 --> 00:58:01,920
I,
you know,

1220
00:58:02,120 --> 00:58:05,600
as I was showing at the beginning,
you can use,

1221
00:58:05,870 --> 00:58:10,870
you can take natural language and wIth 
natural language you can build up a 

1222
00:58:10,870 --> 00:58:15,101
certain amount of,
you can say a certain number of things 

1223
00:58:15,101 --> 00:58:15,101
and natural language.
You can then say,

1224
00:58:15,101 --> 00:58:19,841
well,
how do we make this more precise in a 

1225
00:58:19,841 --> 00:58:20,690
precise symbolic language if you want to
build up more complicated things,

1226
00:58:20,870 --> 00:58:23,030
it gets hard to do that and natural 
language.

1227
00:58:23,210 --> 00:58:26,560
And so you have to kind of build up more
serious programs in,

1228
00:58:26,600 --> 00:58:28,760
in,
in symbolic language.

1229
00:58:29,330 --> 00:58:34,330
And I've probably been numb,
been yacking while here and I'm happy 

1230
00:58:34,330 --> 00:58:38,731
to.
I can talk about all kinds of different 

1231
00:58:38,731 --> 00:58:38,731
things here.
But,

1232
00:58:38,731 --> 00:58:38,800
but maybe I'm,
uh,

1233
00:58:38,820 --> 00:58:41,780
I've not seen as many reactions as I 
might've expected to think.

1234
00:58:41,781 --> 00:58:44,230
So I'm not sure which things people are 
interested in,

1235
00:58:44,231 --> 00:58:44,950
which they're not.
But,

1236
00:58:44,951 --> 00:58:48,880
so maybe I should,
maybe I should stop here and we can have

1237
00:58:48,910 --> 00:58:50,710
discussion questions,
comments?

1238
00:58:50,740 --> 00:58:51,130
Yes.

1239
00:58:54,530 --> 00:58:56,770
Two microphones.
If you have questions,

1240
00:58:56,771 --> 00:58:57,550
please come up.

1241
00:58:58,300 --> 00:58:58,730
So,
uh,

1242
00:58:58,760 --> 00:59:03,760
I have a quick question.
It's close to the earlier part of your 

1243
00:59:03,760 --> 00:59:04,270
talk where you say you don't build a top
down ontology,

1244
00:59:04,271 --> 00:59:07,360
you actually build from the bottom up 
with disparate domains.

1245
00:59:08,110 --> 00:59:13,110
What do you feel are the core 
technologies of the knowledge 

1246
00:59:13,110 --> 00:59:15,781
representation which you used within 
wolfram alpha that allows you a 

1247
00:59:15,781 --> 00:59:20,340
different domains to reason about each 
other to come up with solutions and is 

1248
00:59:20,340 --> 00:59:23,600
there any feeling of differentiability 
for examples if you were to come up with

1249
00:59:23,601 --> 00:59:27,350
a plan to do something new within 
wolfram alpha language,

1250
00:59:28,280 --> 00:59:29,470
how would you go about doing that?

1251
00:59:30,320 --> 00:59:34,070
Okay,
so we've done maybe a couple of thousand

1252
00:59:34,071 --> 00:59:35,570
domains.
Okay.

1253
00:59:36,020 --> 00:59:41,020
They,
what is actually involved in doing one 

1254
00:59:41,020 --> 00:59:41,020
of these domains.
It's,

1255
00:59:41,020 --> 00:59:45,790
it's a gnarly business.
Every domain has some crazy different 

1256
00:59:45,790 --> 00:59:47,810
thing about it.
I tried to make up actually a while ago,

1257
00:59:48,380 --> 00:59:48,980
we,
um,

1258
00:59:49,280 --> 00:59:53,780
let me show you something that kind of a
hierarchy of what it means to make.

1259
00:59:54,240 --> 00:59:59,240
See if I can find this here,
kind of a hierarchy of what it means to 

1260
00:59:59,240 --> 01:00:00,580
make a domain computable.
Uh,

1261
01:00:00,610 --> 01:00:03,060
where is it?
Here we go.

1262
01:00:08,930 --> 01:00:09,680
Okay,
here we go.

1263
01:00:09,920 --> 01:00:14,920
So this is sort of a hierarchy of levels
of what it means to make a domain 

1264
01:00:14,920 --> 01:00:16,160
computable from just,
you know,

1265
01:00:16,161 --> 01:00:17,570
you've got some,
you know,

1266
01:00:17,640 --> 01:00:19,850
you've got some array of data that's 
quite structured.

1267
01:00:19,890 --> 01:00:24,890
Forget the separate issue about 
extracting things from unstructured 

1268
01:00:24,890 --> 01:00:25,760
data,
but let's imagine that you were given,

1269
01:00:26,030 --> 01:00:26,960
you know,
a,

1270
01:00:27,380 --> 01:00:31,610
a bunch of data about landing sites of 
meteorites or something.

1271
01:00:31,850 --> 01:00:33,890
Okay.
So you go through various levels,

1272
01:00:33,891 --> 01:00:35,300
so you know,
things like,

1273
01:00:36,050 --> 01:00:41,050
okay,
the landing sites of the meteorites are 

1274
01:00:41,050 --> 01:00:43,001
the other positions,
just strings or there's some kind of 

1275
01:00:43,001 --> 01:00:43,340
canonical representation of geo 
possession.

1276
01:00:43,850 --> 01:00:46,390
Is the,
is the type of meteorite,

1277
01:00:46,550 --> 01:00:48,230
you know,
some of them are iron meteorites,

1278
01:00:48,231 --> 01:00:53,231
some of them are stone meteorites.
Have you made a canonical 

1279
01:00:53,231 --> 01:00:55,340
representation?
have you made some kind of a way to uh,

1280
01:00:56,060 --> 01:00:58,610
to identify what.
I'm sorry,

1281
01:00:58,611 --> 01:00:59,180
go ahead.
No,

1282
01:00:59,181 --> 01:01:00,650
no,
I mean to do that.

1283
01:01:00,651 --> 01:01:00,920
So,

1284
01:01:01,030 --> 01:01:04,120
so my question is,
if you did have positions as a string as

1285
01:01:04,121 --> 01:01:07,780
well as a canonical representation,
do you have redundant pieces of the same

1286
01:01:08,440 --> 01:01:12,310
redundant representations of the same 
information in different?

1287
01:01:14,680 --> 01:01:16,750
You always,
everything can that you have.

1288
01:01:17,060 --> 01:01:18,760
You have a minimal representation of 
everything.

1289
01:01:18,761 --> 01:01:21,040
So our goal is to make everything 
canonical.

1290
01:01:21,280 --> 01:01:22,760
Now that's,
you know,

1291
01:01:22,870 --> 01:01:25,150
there is a lot of complexity in doing 
that.

1292
01:01:25,151 --> 01:01:26,430
I mean if you,
you know,

1293
01:01:26,440 --> 01:01:27,520
in each.
Okay.

1294
01:01:27,521 --> 01:01:29,860
So another feature of these domains.
Okay.

1295
01:01:29,861 --> 01:01:31,870
So here's another,
another thing to say,

1296
01:01:33,490 --> 01:01:38,490
you know,
it will be lovely if I could just 

1297
01:01:38,490 --> 01:01:38,490
automate everything and cut the humans 
out of the loop.

1298
01:01:38,490 --> 01:01:41,200
Turns out this doesn't work.
And in fact,

1299
01:01:41,201 --> 01:01:46,201
whenever we do these domains,
it's fairly critical to have expert 

1300
01:01:46,201 --> 01:01:48,010
humans who really understand the domain 
or you simply get it wrong.

1301
01:01:48,460 --> 01:01:52,330
And it's also having said that once 
you've done enough domains,

1302
01:01:52,331 --> 01:01:57,331
you can do a lot of crosschecking 
between domains and we are the number 

1303
01:01:57,331 --> 01:02:01,450
one reporters of error and have errors 
and in pretty much all standardized data

1304
01:02:01,451 --> 01:02:04,100
sources because we can do that kind of 
cross checkinG.

1305
01:02:04,420 --> 01:02:08,530
But I think if you ask the question,
what's involved in,

1306
01:02:08,531 --> 01:02:12,040
um,
in bringing online a new domain,

1307
01:02:12,430 --> 01:02:17,430
it's those sort of hierarchy of things.
Some of those take a few hours.

1308
01:02:17,950 --> 01:02:20,400
You can get to the point of having,
you know,

1309
01:02:20,401 --> 01:02:23,040
we've got good enough tools for 
ingesting data,

1310
01:02:23,250 --> 01:02:24,090
figuring out,
oh,

1311
01:02:24,091 --> 01:02:25,920
those are names of cities in that 
column.

1312
01:02:25,930 --> 01:02:28,140
Let's canonic allies.
Those,

1313
01:02:28,860 --> 01:02:33,860
some may be questions,
but many of them will be able to nail 

1314
01:02:33,860 --> 01:02:36,921
down and to get to the full level of,
you've got some complicated domain and 

1315
01:02:37,021 --> 01:02:40,350
it's fully computable is probably a year
of work.

1316
01:02:40,980 --> 01:02:41,760
Um,
and,

1317
01:02:41,761 --> 01:02:43,020
uh,
and you might say,

1318
01:02:43,021 --> 01:02:43,890
well,
gosh,

1319
01:02:43,910 --> 01:02:45,330
why?
Why are you wasting your time?

1320
01:02:45,331 --> 01:02:50,331
You've got to be able to automate that.
So you can probably tell we're fairly 

1321
01:02:50,331 --> 01:02:50,670
sophisticated about machine learning 
kinds of things and so on.

1322
01:02:50,880 --> 01:02:55,880
And we have tried to automate as much as
we can and we have got a pretty 

1323
01:02:55,921 --> 01:02:56,970
efficient pipeline.

1324
01:02:57,150 --> 01:03:00,240
But if you actually want to get it right
and you see it,

1325
01:03:00,241 --> 01:03:05,241
here's an example of what happens,
that there's a level even going between 

1326
01:03:05,241 --> 01:03:07,050
wolf malfa more from language.
there's a level of.

1327
01:03:07,140 --> 01:03:09,660
So for example,
let's say you're looking at,

1328
01:03:09,661 --> 01:03:11,640
you know,
lakes in Wisconsin.

1329
01:03:11,970 --> 01:03:16,970
Okay.
So people are querying about lakes in 

1330
01:03:16,970 --> 01:03:19,161
Wisconsin and wolfram alpha,
they'll name a particular lake and they 

1331
01:03:19,161 --> 01:03:19,161
want to know,
you know,

1332
01:03:19,161 --> 01:03:20,400
how big is the lake?
okay,

1333
01:03:20,401 --> 01:03:25,401
fine.
In wolfram language they'll be doing a 

1334
01:03:25,401 --> 01:03:25,800
systematic computation about lakes in 
Wisconsin.

1335
01:03:25,950 --> 01:03:29,070
So if there's a lake missing,
you're going to get the wrong answer.

1336
01:03:29,400 --> 01:03:31,750
And So that's a kind of higher level of,
of uh,

1337
01:03:32,160 --> 01:03:33,540
of,
of difficulty.

1338
01:03:33,680 --> 01:03:35,010
Okay.
But the,

1339
01:03:35,050 --> 01:03:40,050
there's,
I think you're asking some more 

1340
01:03:40,050 --> 01:03:40,050
technical questions about ontologies and
I can try and answer those.

1341
01:03:40,260 --> 01:03:41,640
Actually.
One quick question.

1342
01:03:41,700 --> 01:03:45,120
Can you know there's,
there's a lot of other questions.

1343
01:03:45,600 --> 01:03:46,440
Okay.
All right.

1344
01:03:46,441 --> 01:03:51,300
I'll give it a recycles as I've got a 
simple question.

1345
01:03:51,690 --> 01:03:56,040
Who or what are your key influences?
Whoa.

1346
01:03:56,041 --> 01:04:01,041
Gosh.
In terms of of language design for 

1347
01:04:01,041 --> 01:04:02,640
orphan language in the context of 
machine intelligence,

1348
01:04:02,641 --> 01:04:07,641
if you liked,
if you want to make it tailored to this 

1349
01:04:07,641 --> 01:04:07,641
audience.

1350
01:04:08,200 --> 01:04:10,680
I don't know.
I've been absorbing stuff forever.

1351
01:04:10,690 --> 01:04:14,260
I think my main in terms of language 
design,

1352
01:04:14,261 --> 01:04:19,261
probably lisp in apl with my sort of 
early influences,

1353
01:04:19,451 --> 01:04:21,290
but in terms of,
of um,

1354
01:04:21,970 --> 01:04:23,530
thinking about ai,

1355
01:04:25,740 --> 01:04:28,090
you know,
in,

1356
01:04:28,580 --> 01:04:31,100
I mean I'm kind of

1357
01:04:31,710 --> 01:04:33,840
quite knowledgeable.
I like history of science.

1358
01:04:33,900 --> 01:04:38,460
I'm pretty knowledgeable about the early
history of kind of mathematical logic,

1359
01:04:38,461 --> 01:04:40,650
symbolic kinds of things.
I would say.

1360
01:04:40,830 --> 01:04:42,930
Okay,
maybe I can answer that in the negative.

1361
01:04:42,931 --> 01:04:43,950
Okay.
I have,

1362
01:04:44,010 --> 01:04:46,050
for example,
in building wolfram alpha,

1363
01:04:47,460 --> 01:04:48,690
I thought,
gosh,

1364
01:04:48,691 --> 01:04:53,691
let me do my homework.
Let me learn all about computational 

1365
01:04:53,691 --> 01:04:55,881
linguistics.
Let me hire some computational 

1366
01:04:55,881 --> 01:04:57,621
linguistics phds.
That will be a good way to get the 

1367
01:04:57,621 --> 01:04:58,950
start.
It turns out we used almost nothing from

1368
01:04:58,951 --> 01:05:03,951
the,
from the previous sort of history of 

1369
01:05:03,951 --> 01:05:06,321
computational linguistics,
partly because what we were trying to 

1370
01:05:06,321 --> 01:05:06,321
do,
namely short question,

1371
01:05:06,321 --> 01:05:10,611
natural language understanding is 
different from a lot of the natural 

1372
01:05:10,611 --> 01:05:11,280
language processing,
which has been done in the past.

1373
01:05:11,520 --> 01:05:15,990
I also have made to my disappointment,
very little use of,

1374
01:05:16,020 --> 01:05:19,630
you know,
people like marvin minsky for example.

1375
01:05:19,631 --> 01:05:21,340
I really don't think.
I mean,

1376
01:05:21,341 --> 01:05:26,341
I knew marvin for years and in fact some
of his early work on simple turing 

1377
01:05:26,341 --> 01:05:30,331
machines and things,
those are probably more influential to 

1378
01:05:30,331 --> 01:05:32,230
me than his work on,
on ai and you know,

1379
01:05:32,260 --> 01:05:37,260
probably my,
my mistake of not understanding that 

1380
01:05:37,260 --> 01:05:40,411
better,
but really I would say that I've been 

1381
01:05:40,411 --> 01:05:42,930
been rather uninfluenced by,
by sort of the traditional ai kinds of 

1382
01:05:42,930 --> 01:05:42,930
things.

1383
01:05:42,930 --> 01:05:44,320
I mean,
it probably hasn't helped that I've kind

1384
01:05:44,321 --> 01:05:47,770
of lived through a time when one sort of
ai went from,

1385
01:05:48,070 --> 01:05:49,140
you know,
when I was a kid,

1386
01:05:49,170 --> 01:05:51,340
ai was going to solve everything in the 
world and then,

1387
01:05:51,390 --> 01:05:56,390
you know,
it kind of decade for awhile and then 

1388
01:05:56,390 --> 01:05:56,390
sort of come back.
So I,

1389
01:05:56,390 --> 01:05:59,990
I,
so I would say I can describe my 

1390
01:05:59,990 --> 01:06:00,200
negative,
my non influences better than my give is

1391
01:06:00,310 --> 01:06:05,310
that you made it your own head and it 
sounds as though that's pretty much 

1392
01:06:05,310 --> 01:06:05,310
right?
Yeah,

1393
01:06:05,310 --> 01:06:05,890
I mean,
yes,

1394
01:06:06,020 --> 01:06:08,470
I mean in so far as there's things to 
me,

1395
01:06:08,540 --> 01:06:12,140
I mean look things like the um,
uh,

1396
01:06:12,550 --> 01:06:13,510
you know.
Okay.

1397
01:06:13,511 --> 01:06:16,540
So for example,
studying simple programs as a.

1398
01:06:16,550 --> 01:06:18,790
I'm trying to understand the universal 
simple programs.

1399
01:06:19,150 --> 01:06:24,150
Actually,
the personal history of that sort of 

1400
01:06:24,150 --> 01:06:24,150
interesting.
I mean,

1401
01:06:24,150 --> 01:06:24,150
I,
I,

1402
01:06:24,150 --> 01:06:26,470
you know,
I used to do particle physics when I was

1403
01:06:26,471 --> 01:06:27,460
a kid basically.

1404
01:06:27,880 --> 01:06:29,250
And um,
uh,

1405
01:06:29,710 --> 01:06:31,750
then I actually got interested.
Okay.

1406
01:06:31,751 --> 01:06:36,751
So I'll tell you the history of that 
just as an example of how sort of 

1407
01:06:36,751 --> 01:06:36,751
interesting as a sort of history of 
ideas type thing.

1408
01:06:37,000 --> 01:06:40,630
So I was interested in,
in how order arises in the universe.

1409
01:06:40,840 --> 01:06:45,840
So you know,
you start off from the hot big bang and 

1410
01:06:45,840 --> 01:06:48,511
then pretty soon you end up with a bunch
of humans and galaxies and things like 

1411
01:06:48,511 --> 01:06:48,511
this.
How does this happen?

1412
01:06:48,820 --> 01:06:53,820
So I got an interest in that question.
I was also interested in things like 

1413
01:06:53,820 --> 01:06:58,030
neural networks for sort of ai purposes 
and I thought let me make a minimal 

1414
01:06:58,541 --> 01:07:03,160
model that encompasses sort of how 
complex things arise from,

1415
01:07:03,490 --> 01:07:08,490
from other stuff.
And I ended up sort of making simpler 

1416
01:07:08,490 --> 01:07:12,601
and simpler and simpler models and 
eventually wound up with cellular 

1417
01:07:12,601 --> 01:07:15,001
automata and whIch I didn't know were 
called cellular automata when I started 

1418
01:07:15,001 --> 01:07:18,750
looking at them and then found they did 
an interesting things and the two areas 

1419
01:07:18,750 --> 01:07:22,651
where cellular automata had been 
singularly unuseful in analyzing things 

1420
01:07:22,811 --> 01:07:26,630
are large scale structure in the 
universe and your own networks.

1421
01:07:26,970 --> 01:07:28,670
So it turned out.
But,

1422
01:07:28,730 --> 01:07:30,160
but that,
by the way,

1423
01:07:30,161 --> 01:07:33,100
the fact that I couldn't have even 
imagined that one could just start.

1424
01:07:33,101 --> 01:07:34,120
Yeah,
I should say,

1425
01:07:34,540 --> 01:07:37,330
you know,
I've been doing physics and in physics,

1426
01:07:37,360 --> 01:07:42,360
the kind of intellectual concept is you 
take the world as it is and you're 

1427
01:07:42,360 --> 01:07:43,590
trying to drill down and find out what,
you know,

1428
01:07:43,630 --> 01:07:45,880
what makes the world out of primitives 
and so on.

1429
01:07:46,090 --> 01:07:51,090
It's kind of a reduced to find things.
Then I built my first computer language,

1430
01:07:51,221 --> 01:07:54,610
I think of the snp which went the other 
way round where I was just like,

1431
01:07:54,611 --> 01:07:57,640
I'm just going to make up this computer 
language and you know,

1432
01:07:57,880 --> 01:07:59,710
just make up what I want the primitives 
to be.

1433
01:07:59,711 --> 01:08:01,180
And then I'm going to build stuff up 
from it.

1434
01:08:01,510 --> 01:08:06,510
I think that the fact that I kind of had
the idea of doing things like making up 

1435
01:08:06,510 --> 01:08:10,890
a little automatons as possible models 
for the world was a consequence of the 

1436
01:08:10,890 --> 01:08:11,080
fact that I've worked on this computer 
language,

1437
01:08:11,290 --> 01:08:14,110
which was a thing which worked the 
opposite way round from the way that one

1438
01:08:14,111 --> 01:08:19,111
is used to doing natural,
which is sort of this reductionist 

1439
01:08:19,111 --> 01:08:19,111
approach.

1440
01:08:19,111 --> 01:08:19,520
And that's.
I mean,

1441
01:08:19,690 --> 01:08:24,690
so that's just an example of I've found.
I happened to have spent a bunch of time

1442
01:08:26,120 --> 01:08:27,380
studying,
as I say,

1443
01:08:27,381 --> 01:08:32,381
history of science and one of my,
one of my hobbies is sort of history of 

1444
01:08:32,381 --> 01:08:36,251
ideas.
I even wrote this little book called 

1445
01:08:36,251 --> 01:08:36,251
idea makers,
which is about biographies of a bunch of

1446
01:08:36,251 --> 01:08:37,940
people who for one reason or another 
I've written about.

1447
01:08:38,210 --> 01:08:43,210
And so I'm,
I'm always curious about this thing 

1448
01:08:43,210 --> 01:08:43,400
about how do people actually wind up 
figuring out the things they figure out.

1449
01:08:43,790 --> 01:08:45,350
and you know,
one of the,

1450
01:08:45,560 --> 01:08:48,020
one of the conclusions that my,
you know,

1451
01:08:48,021 --> 01:08:53,021
investigations with many people is there
a very rarely moments of inspiration.

1452
01:08:53,450 --> 01:08:58,450
Usually it's long multi-decade kinds of 
things which only later get compressed 

1453
01:08:58,761 --> 01:09:02,930
into something short.
And also the path is often much,

1454
01:09:03,590 --> 01:09:05,300
uh,
you know,

1455
01:09:05,301 --> 01:09:06,230
it's,
it's,

1456
01:09:06,430 --> 01:09:08,060
it's,
it's quite,

1457
01:09:08,970 --> 01:09:11,750
uh,
can I say that the steps are quite small

1458
01:09:11,960 --> 01:09:16,960
and you know,
but the path is often kind of 

1459
01:09:16,960 --> 01:09:16,960
complicated and that's what,
that's what it's been for me.

1460
01:09:16,960 --> 01:09:17,080
So I.
Simple question,

1461
01:09:17,081 --> 01:09:18,620
complex answer,
sorry about that.

1462
01:09:20,280 --> 01:09:21,880
Oh,
so,

1463
01:09:21,881 --> 01:09:26,881
um,
when I basically see it from the wall 

1464
01:09:26,881 --> 01:09:29,041
from languages,
it's a way to describe all of objective 

1465
01:09:29,041 --> 01:09:29,610
reality.
It's kind of formalizing your swabbed,

1466
01:09:29,710 --> 01:09:32,330
the entire domain of discourse,
user philosophical term.

1467
01:09:32,331 --> 01:09:35,380
And you kind of hinted at this in your,
a lecture where the,

1468
01:09:35,410 --> 01:09:40,410
where it sort of leaves offices that 
when we start to talk about more 

1469
01:09:40,410 --> 01:09:40,410
esoteric,
philosophical concepts,

1470
01:09:40,410 --> 01:09:45,181
purpose,
I guess this would lead to things like 

1471
01:09:45,181 --> 01:09:48,150
epistemology because essentially you 
only have signed there as amazing as 

1472
01:09:48,150 --> 01:09:51,421
sciences.
There are other things that are talked 

1473
01:09:51,421 --> 01:09:51,421
aboUt not,
you know,

1474
01:09:51,421 --> 01:09:52,210
like idealism versus materialism,
etc.

1475
01:09:52,690 --> 01:09:57,690
Do you have an idea of how well from 
might or might not be able to branch 

1476
01:09:57,690 --> 01:10:00,670
into those discourses?
Because I'm hearing echoes in my head at

1477
01:10:00,671 --> 01:10:03,250
that time,
baal shem said that an ai needs a,

1478
01:10:03,270 --> 01:10:04,900
you know,
when you give an ai a purpose,

1479
01:10:04,901 --> 01:10:06,310
there's like,
I think he said,

1480
01:10:06,700 --> 01:10:11,700
philosophers are divided completely 
evenly between the top four ways to 

1481
01:10:11,700 --> 01:10:11,700
measure how good something should be.

1482
01:10:11,700 --> 01:10:14,290
It's like utilitarianism and sugar are 
the foremost japanese.

1483
01:10:14,780 --> 01:10:15,160
Yeah.
Right.

1484
01:10:15,550 --> 01:10:16,570
So the first thing is,
I mean,

1485
01:10:16,571 --> 01:10:20,770
this problem of making what about 300 
years ago,

1486
01:10:20,771 --> 01:10:23,950
people like live nets were interested in
the same problem that I'm interested in,

1487
01:10:23,951 --> 01:10:28,951
which is how do you formalize sort of 
everyday discourse and live minutes had 

1488
01:10:28,951 --> 01:10:29,380
the original idea,
you know,

1489
01:10:29,381 --> 01:10:34,381
he was originally trained as a lawyer 
and he had this idea if he could only 

1490
01:10:34,381 --> 01:10:37,000
reduce all law,
all legal questions to matters of logic,

1491
01:10:37,180 --> 01:10:42,180
he could have a machine that would 
basically describe the answer every 

1492
01:10:42,180 --> 01:10:44,800
legal case.
He was unfortunately a few hundred years

1493
01:10:44,801 --> 01:10:45,970
too early.
Um,

1494
01:10:46,240 --> 01:10:47,470
even though he did have,
you know,

1495
01:10:47,471 --> 01:10:49,420
he tried to,
he tried to do all kinds of things,

1496
01:10:49,421 --> 01:10:54,421
very similar things I've tried to do,
like he tried to get various dukes to 

1497
01:10:54,421 --> 01:10:56,470
assemble big libraries of data.
And stuff like this,

1498
01:10:56,471 --> 01:10:57,820
but,
but the point.

1499
01:10:58,750 --> 01:11:03,750
So what he tried to do was to make a 
formalized representation of everyday 

1500
01:11:03,750 --> 01:11:06,460
discourse for whatever reason for the 
last 300 years.

1501
01:11:06,461 --> 01:11:08,230
Basically people haven't tried to do 
that.

1502
01:11:08,530 --> 01:11:11,320
There's,
it's almost completely barren landscape.

1503
01:11:11,680 --> 01:11:16,680
There was this period of time in the 16 
hundredS when people talked about 

1504
01:11:16,680 --> 01:11:18,120
philosophicAl languages.
Lightness was one.

1505
01:11:18,121 --> 01:11:23,121
A guy called John Wilkins was another 
and they tried to break down human 

1506
01:11:23,221 --> 01:11:25,320
thought into something.
Symbolic.

1507
01:11:25,740 --> 01:11:27,450
People haven't done that for a long 
time.

1508
01:11:27,990 --> 01:11:30,450
Um,
in terms of what can we do that with,

1509
01:11:30,810 --> 01:11:31,830
um,
you know,

1510
01:11:32,100 --> 01:11:34,830
I've been trying to figure out what the 
best way to do it is.

1511
01:11:34,831 --> 01:11:38,580
I think it's actUally not as hard as one
might think these areas.

1512
01:11:38,700 --> 01:11:43,700
One thing you have to understand these 
areas like philosophy and so on are 

1513
01:11:43,700 --> 01:11:44,670
there on the harder end.
I mean things like,

1514
01:11:44,980 --> 01:11:46,620
good example,
typical example,

1515
01:11:46,780 --> 01:11:48,570
you know,
I want to have a piece of chocolate.

1516
01:11:48,930 --> 01:11:51,840
Okay.
They in wolfram language right now,

1517
01:11:51,841 --> 01:11:54,210
we have a pretty good description of 
pieces of chocolate.

1518
01:11:54,540 --> 01:11:55,960
We know all sorts of,
you know,

1519
01:11:55,980 --> 01:11:58,320
we probably know 100 different kinds of 
chocolate.

1520
01:11:58,321 --> 01:12:03,321
We know how big the pieces are,
all that kind of thing that I want part 

1521
01:12:03,321 --> 01:12:04,320
of that sentence.
We can't do that right now.

1522
01:12:04,640 --> 01:12:09,640
Um,
but I don't think that's that hard and 

1523
01:12:09,640 --> 01:12:09,640
I'm,
you know,

1524
01:12:09,640 --> 01:12:12,180
that's now if you ask,
let's say we had,

1525
01:12:12,240 --> 01:12:17,240
I think the different thing you're 
saying is let's say we had the 

1526
01:12:17,240 --> 01:12:18,900
omnipotent ai so to speak,
that was able to,

1527
01:12:18,901 --> 01:12:23,901
you know,
where we turn over the control of the 

1528
01:12:23,901 --> 01:12:24,390
central bank to the ai return over all 
these other things to the ai.

1529
01:12:24,600 --> 01:12:28,200
Then the question is we say to the ai 
now do the right thing.

1530
01:12:28,770 --> 01:12:32,820
And then the problem with that is,
and this is why I talk about,

1531
01:12:32,821 --> 01:12:35,130
you know,
creating ai constitutions and so on,

1532
01:12:36,000 --> 01:12:38,520
we have absolutely no idea what to do.

1533
01:12:38,520 --> 01:12:41,280
The right thing is supposed to mean.
And philosophers have been arguing about

1534
01:12:41,281 --> 01:12:41,640
that.
You know,

1535
01:12:41,710 --> 01:12:46,260
utilitarianism is an example of that,
of one of the answers to that.

1536
01:12:46,261 --> 01:12:48,240
Although it's not a complete answer by 
any means,

1537
01:12:48,241 --> 01:12:51,090
it's not really an answer.
It's just a way of posing the question.

1538
01:12:51,340 --> 01:12:53,070
Um,
and so I think that the,

1539
01:12:53,210 --> 01:12:54,090
you know,
one of,

1540
01:12:54,110 --> 01:12:59,110
one of the features of um,
so I think it's a really hard problem 

1541
01:12:59,110 --> 01:12:59,680
to,
you know,

1542
01:13:00,240 --> 01:13:03,060
you think to yourself,
what should the ai constitution actually

1543
01:13:03,061 --> 01:13:04,980
say?
So first thing you might think is,

1544
01:13:05,220 --> 01:13:10,220
oh,
there's going to be something like 

1545
01:13:10,220 --> 01:13:10,220
asimov's laws of robotics that's going 
to be one,

1546
01:13:10,220 --> 01:13:11,670
you know,
golden rule for ais.

1547
01:13:11,970 --> 01:13:14,490
And if we just follow that golden rule 
or we.

1548
01:13:14,491 --> 01:13:15,600
Well,
okay,

1549
01:13:15,900 --> 01:13:18,780
I think that that is absolutely 
impossible.

1550
01:13:18,870 --> 01:13:23,870
And in fact I think you can even sort of
mathematically prove that that's 

1551
01:13:23,870 --> 01:13:25,650
impossible because I think as soon as 
you have a system that,

1552
01:13:26,280 --> 01:13:31,280
you know,
essentially what you're trying to do is 

1553
01:13:31,280 --> 01:13:31,280
you're trying to put in constraints 
that,

1554
01:13:31,790 --> 01:13:36,790
okay,
basically as soon as you have a system 

1555
01:13:36,790 --> 01:13:36,790
that shows computational 
irreplaceability,

1556
01:13:36,790 --> 01:13:40,850
I think it is inevitable that you have a
case of have unintended consequences of 

1557
01:13:41,161 --> 01:13:43,950
things,
which means that you never get,

1558
01:13:44,010 --> 01:13:49,010
just say,
put everything in this one very nice 

1559
01:13:49,010 --> 01:13:49,010
box.

1560
01:13:49,010 --> 01:13:49,710
You always have to say,
let's put on a patch here.

1561
01:13:49,711 --> 01:13:54,711
Let's put on a patch there.
And so on a version of this much more 

1562
01:13:54,711 --> 01:13:54,870
abstract version of this girdle's 
theorem.

1563
01:13:55,290 --> 01:13:57,700
So girdle's theorem is,
you know,

1564
01:13:57,720 --> 01:13:59,790
it starts out by taking the,
uh,

1565
01:14:00,000 --> 01:14:05,000
you know,
it's girls' therapist trying to talk 

1566
01:14:05,000 --> 01:14:06,210
about integers and says,
start off with pianos,

1567
01:14:06,211 --> 01:14:07,710
axioms,
pianos,

1568
01:14:07,711 --> 01:14:10,980
axioms,
you might say in piano thought described

1569
01:14:11,050 --> 01:14:13,510
integers and nothing but the integers.
Okay?

1570
01:14:13,540 --> 01:14:16,710
So another thing that's provable from 
pianos,

1571
01:14:16,711 --> 01:14:19,150
accidents will be true about integers 
and vice versa.

1572
01:14:19,240 --> 01:14:24,240
Okay.
What girdle's theorem shows is that yoU 

1573
01:14:24,240 --> 01:14:24,240
can,
that will never work,

1574
01:14:24,240 --> 01:14:27,840
that there are an infinite hierarchy of 
patches that you have to put on two 

1575
01:14:27,840 --> 01:14:31,561
pianos,
axioms if you want to describe the 

1576
01:14:31,561 --> 01:14:32,620
integers and nothing but the integers.
And I think the same is true if you want

1577
01:14:32,621 --> 01:14:36,730
to have a legal system effectively that 
has no bizarre,

1578
01:14:36,731 --> 01:14:37,770
unintended consequences.

1579
01:14:37,790 --> 01:14:40,200
I don't think it's possible to just say,
you know,

1580
01:14:40,210 --> 01:14:45,210
if you,
when you're describing something in the 

1581
01:14:45,210 --> 01:14:45,610
world that's complicated like that,
I don't think it's possible to just have

1582
01:14:45,850 --> 01:14:49,870
a small set of rules that will always do
what we want.

1583
01:14:49,871 --> 01:14:51,580
So to speak.
I think it's inevitable that you have to

1584
01:14:51,581 --> 01:14:55,630
have a long essentially code of laws and
that's what,

1585
01:14:55,760 --> 01:15:00,760
you know.
So my guess is that what we'll actually 

1586
01:15:00,760 --> 01:15:00,760
have to happen is,
you know,

1587
01:15:00,760 --> 01:15:01,510
as we try and describe what you,
we want the eyes to do,

1588
01:15:02,440 --> 01:15:04,570
you know,
I don't know the socio political aspects

1589
01:15:04,571 --> 01:15:09,571
of how we'll figure out whether it's one
ai constitution or one per,

1590
01:15:10,930 --> 01:15:13,090
you know,
city or whatever.

1591
01:15:13,870 --> 01:15:15,550
We can talk about that.
That's a separate issue.

1592
01:15:15,551 --> 01:15:16,300
But,
but,

1593
01:15:16,301 --> 01:15:17,190
um,
you know,

1594
01:15:17,260 --> 01:15:19,660
I think what will happen is it'll be 
much like human laws.

1595
01:15:19,661 --> 01:15:22,180
There'll be a complicated thing that 
gets progressively patched.

1596
01:15:22,510 --> 01:15:25,420
And so I think it's some and these ideas
like,

1597
01:15:25,750 --> 01:15:26,790
um,
you know,

1598
01:15:26,860 --> 01:15:28,420
oh,
we'll just make the eyes,

1599
01:15:28,520 --> 01:15:30,730
you know,
run the world according to,

1600
01:15:30,820 --> 01:15:32,630
you know,
mills,

1601
01:15:32,750 --> 01:15:34,750
you know,
John Stuart mill's idea.

1602
01:15:35,170 --> 01:15:38,590
It's not going to work the best,
which is not surprising.

1603
01:15:38,620 --> 01:15:39,970
This philosophy has,
has,

1604
01:15:40,120 --> 01:15:41,860
has made the point that it's not as 
easy,

1605
01:15:41,890 --> 01:15:44,020
not an easy problem for the last 2000 
years.

1606
01:15:44,290 --> 01:15:46,330
And they're right.
It's not an easy problem.

1607
01:15:47,110 --> 01:15:47,530
Thank you.

1608
01:15:49,200 --> 01:15:49,870
I,
I'm,

1609
01:15:50,300 --> 01:15:55,300
you're talking about computational 
reducibility and computational 

1610
01:15:55,300 --> 01:15:59,601
equivalent and also that earlier on in 
your intellectual adventures you're 

1611
01:15:59,601 --> 01:16:01,680
interested in particle physics and 
things like that.

1612
01:16:02,670 --> 01:16:07,670
I've heard you make the comment before 
and in other contexts that things like 

1613
01:16:08,131 --> 01:16:13,131
molecules compute and I was curious to 
ask you exactly what you mean by that.

1614
01:16:13,441 --> 01:16:14,090
In what sense does,

1615
01:16:16,390 --> 01:16:21,390
I mean,
what would you like to compute so to 

1616
01:16:21,390 --> 01:16:22,180
speak?
I mean in other words,

1617
01:16:22,200 --> 01:16:27,200
you what,
what is the case is that no one 

1618
01:16:27,581 --> 01:16:31,180
definition of your computing is given a 
particular computation like,

1619
01:16:31,181 --> 01:16:36,181
I don't know,
finding square roots or something you 

1620
01:16:36,181 --> 01:16:39,270
can program.
A surprising thing is that an awful lot 

1621
01:16:39,341 --> 01:16:44,341
of stuff can be programmed to do any 
computation you want that some,

1622
01:16:45,670 --> 01:16:46,810
you know,
when it comes to.

1623
01:16:46,811 --> 01:16:51,811
I mean I think for example,
when you look at nanotechnology and so 

1624
01:16:51,811 --> 01:16:51,811
on,
the,

1625
01:16:51,811 --> 01:16:51,820
the,
the current,

1626
01:16:52,180 --> 01:16:57,180
you know,
one of the current belief says to make 

1627
01:16:57,180 --> 01:16:59,791
very small computers,
you should take what we know about 

1628
01:16:59,791 --> 01:17:00,940
making big computers and just,
you know,

1629
01:17:01,330 --> 01:17:06,330
make them smaller so to speak.
I don't think that's the approach you 

1630
01:17:06,330 --> 01:17:07,390
have to use.
I think you can take the components that

1631
01:17:07,391 --> 01:17:12,391
exist at a lot of molecules and say,
how do we assemble those components to 

1632
01:17:12,921 --> 01:17:14,480
be able to do complicated computations?

1633
01:17:14,480 --> 01:17:16,820
I mean,
it's likely cellular automata that the,

1634
01:17:17,000 --> 01:17:22,000
you know,
the underlying rule for the seller 

1635
01:17:22,000 --> 01:17:24,140
automaton is very simple.
Yet when that rule is applied,

1636
01:17:24,141 --> 01:17:26,660
many times it can do a sophisticated 
computation.

1637
01:17:26,870 --> 01:17:29,360
So I think that that's the,
that's the sense in which,

1638
01:17:31,220 --> 01:17:36,220
what can I say,
the raw material that you need for 

1639
01:17:36,220 --> 01:17:36,280
computation can be,
you know,

1640
01:17:36,290 --> 01:17:41,290
there's a great diversity and the raw 
material that you can use for 

1641
01:17:41,290 --> 01:17:41,600
computation.
Our particular human development,

1642
01:17:41,640 --> 01:17:42,530
you know,
stack of,

1643
01:17:42,620 --> 01:17:43,930
of,
uh,

1644
01:17:43,940 --> 01:17:48,940
of technologies that we use for 
computation right now is just one 

1645
01:17:48,940 --> 01:17:48,940
particular path.
And we can,

1646
01:17:48,940 --> 01:17:53,320
you know,
so a very practical example of this is 

1647
01:17:53,320 --> 01:17:55,481
algorithmic drugs.
So the question is right now drugs 

1648
01:17:55,481 --> 01:17:56,720
pretty much work by most drugs work by,
you know,

1649
01:17:56,721 --> 01:17:59,690
there is a binding site on a molecule,
drug fits into binding site,

1650
01:17:59,691 --> 01:18:01,490
does something.
The question is,

1651
01:18:01,640 --> 01:18:06,640
can you imagine having something where 
the molecule is something which has 

1652
01:18:06,640 --> 01:18:11,320
computations going on in it,
where it goes around and it looks at 

1653
01:18:11,320 --> 01:18:11,320
that,
you know,

1654
01:18:11,320 --> 01:18:13,280
that thing it's supposed to be binding 
to and it figures out,

1655
01:18:13,281 --> 01:18:18,281
oh,
there's this knob here and that knob 

1656
01:18:18,281 --> 01:18:18,281
there,
it reconfigures itself.

1657
01:18:18,281 --> 01:18:20,000
It's computing something.
It's trying to figure out,

1658
01:18:20,001 --> 01:18:25,001
you know,
is this likely to be a tumor cell or 

1659
01:18:25,001 --> 01:18:25,001
whatever based on some more complicated 
thing.

1660
01:18:25,001 --> 01:18:28,460
That's the type of thing that I mean by,
by computations happening at a scale.

1661
01:18:28,700 --> 01:18:33,700
Okay.
I guess I meant to ask if it follows 

1662
01:18:33,700 --> 01:18:36,731
from that,
if in your view like the molecules in 

1663
01:18:36,731 --> 01:18:40,721
the track board and in my face and in 
the table are in any sense currently 

1664
01:18:40,721 --> 01:18:43,010
during doing computer.
I mean the question of what computation.

1665
01:18:43,011 --> 01:18:45,050
Look,
one of the things to realize if you look

1666
01:18:45,051 --> 01:18:47,990
at kind of the sort of past and future 
of things,

1667
01:18:48,260 --> 01:18:49,700
the,
the um.

1668
01:18:50,690 --> 01:18:51,770
Okay.
So here's an observation.

1669
01:18:51,771 --> 01:18:55,250
Actually I was about leipnetz actually.
Enlightenment says time.

1670
01:18:55,251 --> 01:18:59,690
Leipnetz made a,
a calculator type computer out of bras.

1671
01:18:59,870 --> 01:19:01,460
Took them 30 years.
Okay.

1672
01:19:01,670 --> 01:19:03,760
So in his day there was,
you know,

1673
01:19:03,800 --> 01:19:06,680
at most one computer in the world as far
as he was concerned,

1674
01:19:06,681 --> 01:19:07,040
right?

1675
01:19:07,370 --> 01:19:09,320
Today's world,
there may be 10 billion computers,

1676
01:19:09,321 --> 01:19:11,270
maybe 20 billion computers.
I don't know.

1677
01:19:11,810 --> 01:19:13,820
The question is what's that gonna look 
like in the future?

1678
01:19:14,260 --> 01:19:19,260
And I think the answer is that in time 
probably everything we have will be made

1679
01:19:19,611 --> 01:19:23,420
of computers and the following sense 
that basically it won't be,

1680
01:19:23,421 --> 01:19:25,160
you know,
in today's world things are made of,

1681
01:19:25,161 --> 01:19:26,210
you know,
metal,

1682
01:19:26,211 --> 01:19:27,560
plastic,
whatever else.

1683
01:19:27,800 --> 01:19:32,800
But actually that won't make it.
There won't be any point in doing that 

1684
01:19:32,800 --> 01:19:32,800
once we know how to do,
you know,

1685
01:19:32,800 --> 01:19:34,970
I'm not a killer scale manufacturing and
so on.

1686
01:19:35,180 --> 01:19:37,940
We might as well just make everything 
out of programmable stuff.

1687
01:19:38,480 --> 01:19:40,880
And I think that's a,
that's a sense in which,

1688
01:19:41,180 --> 01:19:41,700
you know,
the,

1689
01:19:41,701 --> 01:19:42,190
the,
um,

1690
01:19:42,910 --> 01:19:47,910
you know,
the one example we have molecular 

1691
01:19:47,910 --> 01:19:47,910
computing right now is us bio and 
biology.

1692
01:19:47,910 --> 01:19:51,830
Biology does a reasonable job of 
specific kinds of molecular computing.

1693
01:19:52,140 --> 01:19:53,450
Um,
it's kind of embarrassing.

1694
01:19:53,451 --> 01:19:54,970
I think that the only,
you know,

1695
01:19:55,160 --> 01:19:59,030
molecule we know that sort of a memory 
molecule is dna and it's kind of,

1696
01:19:59,090 --> 01:20:00,320
you know,
which is kind of the,

1697
01:20:00,580 --> 01:20:05,580
you know,
the particular biological solution in 

1698
01:20:05,580 --> 01:20:05,580
time.
We'll know lots of others and um,

1699
01:20:05,580 --> 01:20:06,150
you know,
I think the,

1700
01:20:06,151 --> 01:20:06,640
the,
um,

1701
01:20:06,830 --> 01:20:10,710
sort of the end point is so if you're 
asking is,

1702
01:20:11,020 --> 01:20:14,010
is computation going on in this water 
bottle?

1703
01:20:14,011 --> 01:20:19,011
The answer is absolutely.
It's probably even many aspects of that 

1704
01:20:19,011 --> 01:20:19,011
computation,
a pretty sophisticated.

1705
01:20:19,011 --> 01:20:21,780
If we wanted to know what would happen 
to particular molecules here,

1706
01:20:21,781 --> 01:20:26,781
it's going to be hard to tell there's 
going to be computational 

1707
01:20:26,781 --> 01:20:29,250
reproducibility and so on.
Can we make use of that for our human 

1708
01:20:29,250 --> 01:20:32,660
purposes?
Can we piggyback on that to achieve 

1709
01:20:32,660 --> 01:20:34,410
something technological that's different
issue and that's the for that we have to

1710
01:20:34,411 --> 01:20:38,700
build up this whole sort of chain of,
of technology to be able to connect it,

1711
01:20:38,880 --> 01:20:43,880
which is what I've kind of been been 
keep on talking about is how do we 

1712
01:20:43,880 --> 01:20:47,361
connect sort of what is possible 
computationally in the universe to what 

1713
01:20:47,361 --> 01:20:51,570
we humans can kind of conceptualize that
we want to do in computation and that's,

1714
01:20:51,780 --> 01:20:56,780
you know,
that's the bridge that we have to make 

1715
01:20:56,780 --> 01:20:56,780
and that's the hard part.

1716
01:20:56,780 --> 01:20:56,970
but getting the intrinsic,
getting the computation done is,

1717
01:20:57,300 --> 01:20:58,360
is um,
you know,

1718
01:20:58,710 --> 01:21:00,900
those computation going on all over the 
place.

1719
01:21:01,540 --> 01:21:06,540
But maybe a couple more questions.
I was hoping you could elaborate on what

1720
01:21:07,191 --> 01:21:12,191
you were talking about earlier of like 
searching the entire space of possible 

1721
01:21:12,191 --> 01:21:14,790
programs.
So that's very broad.

1722
01:21:14,791 --> 01:21:19,791
So maybe like what kind of searching of 
that space we're good at and what we're 

1723
01:21:19,981 --> 01:21:22,200
not.
And I guess what I mean,

1724
01:21:22,320 --> 01:21:25,770
I would say that we're at an early stage
and not knowing how to do that.

1725
01:21:25,950 --> 01:21:30,950
Okay.
So I've done lots of these things and 

1726
01:21:30,950 --> 01:21:33,750
they are the thing that I've noticed is 
if you do an exhaustive search,

1727
01:21:34,230 --> 01:21:36,960
then you don't miss even things that you
weren't looking for.

1728
01:21:37,740 --> 01:21:42,740
If you do a non exhaustive search,
there is a tremendous tendency to miss 

1729
01:21:42,740 --> 01:21:44,520
things that you weren't looking for.
Um,

1730
01:21:44,880 --> 01:21:46,920
and so,
you know,

1731
01:21:46,980 --> 01:21:51,980
we've done such as a bunch of function 
evaluation and wolfram language is done 

1732
01:21:51,980 --> 01:21:56,511
by,
was done by searching for optimal 

1733
01:21:56,511 --> 01:21:59,061
approximations in some big space,
a bunch of stuff with hashing has done 

1734
01:21:59,061 --> 01:21:59,220
that way.

1735
01:21:59,370 --> 01:22:04,370
A bunch of image processing is done that
way where we're just sort of searching 

1736
01:22:04,370 --> 01:22:07,760
this,
doing exhaustive searches and maybe 

1737
01:22:07,760 --> 01:22:08,280
trillions of programs to find things.
Now,

1738
01:22:08,340 --> 01:22:09,330
you know,
there is,

1739
01:22:09,331 --> 01:22:14,210
on the other side of that story is the 
incremental improvements story with,

1740
01:22:14,240 --> 01:22:17,250
with deep learning and neural networks 
and so on,

1741
01:22:17,460 --> 01:22:19,670
where because there is differentiability
um,

1742
01:22:20,220 --> 01:22:23,640
you're able to sort of incrementally get
to a better solution.

1743
01:22:23,910 --> 01:22:28,910
Now in fact,
people are making less and less 

1744
01:22:28,910 --> 01:22:29,220
differentiability and deep learning 
neural nets.

1745
01:22:29,520 --> 01:22:32,240
And so I think eventually there's going 
to be sort of a,

1746
01:22:32,320 --> 01:22:35,430
a grand unification of these kinds of 
approaches.

1747
01:22:36,420 --> 01:22:38,160
Right now we're still,
you know,

1748
01:22:38,161 --> 01:22:40,740
I don't really know what the,
you know,

1749
01:22:40,770 --> 01:22:45,770
the exhaustive search side of things,
which you can use for all sorts of 

1750
01:22:45,770 --> 01:22:45,770
purposes.
I mean,

1751
01:22:45,770 --> 01:22:50,150
there's the reason,
the surprising thing that makes 

1752
01:22:50,150 --> 01:22:52,510
exhaustive search not crazy is that 
there is rich sophisticated stuff near 

1753
01:22:53,641 --> 01:22:57,450
at hand and the computational universe,
if you had to go quadrillions,

1754
01:22:57,540 --> 01:23:02,540
you know,
through a quadrillion cases before you 

1755
01:23:02,540 --> 01:23:02,540
ever found a thing.

1756
01:23:02,540 --> 01:23:04,800
Exhaustive search will be hopeless,
but you don't in many cases.

1757
01:23:05,110 --> 01:23:06,200
Um,
and uh,

1758
01:23:06,270 --> 01:23:11,270
you know,
I would say that we are in a fairly 

1759
01:23:11,270 --> 01:23:13,231
primitive stage of the,
of the science of how to do those such 

1760
01:23:13,231 --> 01:23:13,231
as.
Well.

1761
01:23:13,231 --> 01:23:15,040
My guess is that there'll be some sort 
of unification,

1762
01:23:15,041 --> 01:23:20,041
which needless to say,
I've thought a bunch about between kind 

1763
01:23:20,041 --> 01:23:23,971
of the norm.
That tradeoff typically in neural net 

1764
01:23:23,971 --> 01:23:27,370
says you can have a neural net that is 
very good at that is uses it's 

1765
01:23:27,370 --> 01:23:29,140
computational resources.
Well,

1766
01:23:29,200 --> 01:23:34,200
but it's really hard to train.
Or you can have a neural net that 

1767
01:23:34,200 --> 01:23:34,330
doesn't use this computational resources
so well,

1768
01:23:34,390 --> 01:23:39,110
but it's very easy to train because it's
very smoothly and you know,

1769
01:23:39,200 --> 01:23:44,200
my guess is that somewhere in the harder
to train but makes use of things that 

1770
01:23:45,041 --> 01:23:50,041
are to the complete computational 
universe is where one's going to see 

1771
01:23:50,041 --> 01:23:50,630
progress,
but it's,

1772
01:23:50,631 --> 01:23:55,631
it's a,
it's a really interesting area and I 

1773
01:23:55,631 --> 01:23:57,670
consider us own it at the beginning of 
figuring that out.

1774
01:23:58,220 --> 01:23:59,470
The one last question.

1775
01:24:01,010 --> 01:24:04,670
Keep going.
Thank you for your talk.

1776
01:24:04,730 --> 01:24:06,860
I just to give a bit of context for my 
question,

1777
01:24:07,070 --> 01:24:12,070
I researched how we could teach ai 
toolkits and evolving platforms for 

1778
01:24:12,070 --> 01:24:15,551
that.
How we could teach artificial 

1779
01:24:15,551 --> 01:24:16,751
intelligence and machine learning to 
children and I know you develop 

1780
01:24:16,751 --> 01:24:19,541
resources for that as well.
So I was wondering like where do you 

1781
01:24:19,581 --> 01:24:24,581
think it's problematic that we have 
computation that is very efficient and 

1782
01:24:24,581 --> 01:24:26,480
can promote utd darien and problem 
solving perspective?

1783
01:24:26,920 --> 01:24:30,270
It achieves all the goals but we don't 
understand that how we have it worked.

1784
01:24:30,271 --> 01:24:35,271
So we have to create this fake steps and
if he could think of scenarios where 

1785
01:24:35,271 --> 01:24:40,061
that could become very problematic over 
time and why do we approach it such and 

1786
01:24:40,061 --> 01:24:44,220
such a deterministic way.
And when you mentioned that 

1787
01:24:44,220 --> 01:24:44,920
computational intelligence are 
differentiated by this,

1788
01:24:44,921 --> 01:24:49,921
like very thin line,
how does that affect the way you learn 

1789
01:24:49,921 --> 01:24:51,170
and how do you think that will affect 
the way we learn?

1790
01:24:51,171 --> 01:24:51,480
We learn.

1791
01:24:52,040 --> 01:24:54,570
So I mean look,
my general principle about,

1792
01:24:55,550 --> 01:25:00,550
you know,
future generations and what they should 

1793
01:25:00,550 --> 01:25:00,550
learn.
I mean,

1794
01:25:00,550 --> 01:25:02,871
first point is very obvious point that 
for every field that people study 

1795
01:25:04,740 --> 01:25:09,740
archaeology to zoology,
there either is now a computational x or

1796
01:25:09,961 --> 01:25:11,870
there will be soon.
So you know,

1797
01:25:11,970 --> 01:25:16,970
every field,
the paradigm of computation is becoming 

1798
01:25:16,970 --> 01:25:21,531
important,
perhaps the dominant paradigm in that 

1799
01:25:21,531 --> 01:25:21,531
field.
Okay.

1800
01:25:21,531 --> 01:25:24,861
So how do you teach kids to be useful in
a world where everything is 

1801
01:25:24,861 --> 01:25:28,911
computational?
I think the number one thing is to teach

1802
01:25:29,671 --> 01:25:32,100
them how to think in computational 
terms.

1803
01:25:32,490 --> 01:25:37,490
What does that mean?
It doesn't mean writing code 

1804
01:25:37,490 --> 01:25:37,490
necessarily.
I mean,

1805
01:25:37,490 --> 01:25:39,000
in other words,
one of the things that's happening right

1806
01:25:39,001 --> 01:25:40,890
now as a practical matter,
as you know,

1807
01:25:40,891 --> 01:25:44,340
there've been these waves of enthusiasm 
for teaching coding of various kinds.

1808
01:25:44,610 --> 01:25:45,250
You know,
we're in a.

1809
01:25:45,320 --> 01:25:48,330
We're not actually,
we're in the end of an uptick wave.

1810
01:25:48,330 --> 01:25:51,290
I think it's going down again,
you know,

1811
01:25:51,330 --> 01:25:53,730
it's been up and down for 40 years or 
so.

1812
01:25:54,860 --> 01:25:56,520
Okay.
Why doesn't that work?

1813
01:25:56,850 --> 01:26:01,850
What doesn't work?
Because while there are people like 

1814
01:26:01,850 --> 01:26:01,850
people who are students at mit for 
example,

1815
01:26:01,850 --> 01:26:06,740
for whom they really to learn 
engineering style coding and it really 

1816
01:26:06,740 --> 01:26:09,890
makes sense to them to learn that the 
vast majority of people,

1817
01:26:09,920 --> 01:26:13,340
it's just not going to be irrelevant 
because they're not going to write a low

1818
01:26:13,341 --> 01:26:18,341
level c program or something.
And it's the same thing that's happened 

1819
01:26:18,341 --> 01:26:19,940
in math education,
which has been sort of a disaster there.

1820
01:26:20,180 --> 01:26:25,180
Which is the number one takeaway for 
most people from the math they learn in 

1821
01:26:25,180 --> 01:26:28,730
school is I don't like math.
And you know,

1822
01:26:28,790 --> 01:26:31,190
that's not for all of them obviously,
but that's the,

1823
01:26:31,191 --> 01:26:33,590
you know,
if you asked a general scale,

1824
01:26:33,770 --> 01:26:35,720
you know,
what people and why is that?

1825
01:26:35,720 --> 01:26:40,720
Well,
part of the reason is because what's 

1826
01:26:40,720 --> 01:26:40,720
been taught is rather low level and 
mechanical.

1827
01:26:40,720 --> 01:26:42,890
It's not about mathematical thinking 
particularly.

1828
01:26:43,070 --> 01:26:48,070
It's mostly about what teachers can 
teach and what assessment processes can 

1829
01:26:48,070 --> 01:26:48,320
assess and so on.
Okay.

1830
01:26:48,321 --> 01:26:51,170
So how should one teach computational 
thinking?

1831
01:26:51,171 --> 01:26:51,620
I mean,
I'm,

1832
01:26:51,680 --> 01:26:55,460
I'm kind of excited about what we can do
with wolfram language because I think we

1833
01:26:55,461 --> 01:26:59,930
have a high enough level language that 
people can actually write,

1834
01:27:00,200 --> 01:27:01,490
you know,
that for example,

1835
01:27:01,491 --> 01:27:05,990
I reckon by age 11 or 12,
and I've done many experiments on this,

1836
01:27:05,991 --> 01:27:10,991
so I have some,
the only problem with my experiments as 

1837
01:27:10,991 --> 01:27:12,590
most of my experiments end up being with
kids who are high achieving kids,

1838
01:27:13,040 --> 01:27:15,530
despite many efforts to reach lower 
achieving kids,

1839
01:27:15,531 --> 01:27:19,760
that always ends up that the kids who 
actually do the things that I set up for

1840
01:27:19,810 --> 01:27:20,860
the high achieving kids.
but,

1841
01:27:20,861 --> 01:27:23,180
but setting that aside,
you know,

1842
01:27:23,240 --> 01:27:26,970
you take the typical um,
uh,

1843
01:27:27,050 --> 01:27:27,740
you know,
11,

1844
01:27:27,741 --> 01:27:29,300
12,
13 year olds and so on,

1845
01:27:29,630 --> 01:27:33,140
and they can learn how to write stuff in
this language.

1846
01:27:33,200 --> 01:27:36,260
And what's interesting is they learn to 
start thinking here,

1847
01:27:36,290 --> 01:27:37,790
I'll show you.
Let's be very practical.

1848
01:27:37,791 --> 01:27:42,791
I can show you.
I was doing every sunday I do a little 

1849
01:27:42,791 --> 01:27:44,450
little thing with some middle school 
kids and I might even be able to find my

1850
01:27:44,451 --> 01:27:46,140
stuff from yesterday.
This is,

1851
01:27:46,141 --> 01:27:46,720
this is,
um,

1852
01:27:46,820 --> 01:27:47,750
okay.
Let's see.

1853
01:27:48,680 --> 01:27:52,580
Programming adventures sharing 20 days.
Okay,

1854
01:27:52,581 --> 01:27:53,960
let's see what I did.
Oh,

1855
01:27:53,961 --> 01:27:54,770
look at that.
That was,

1856
01:27:54,771 --> 01:27:59,771
that was why I thought of the south 
America thing here because I had just 

1857
01:27:59,771 --> 01:27:59,771
done that with these kids.
Um,

1858
01:27:59,771 --> 01:28:00,260
the,
um,

1859
01:28:01,460 --> 01:28:03,170
and so,
uh,

1860
01:28:03,230 --> 01:28:06,440
what are we doing?
We were trying to figure out this,

1861
01:28:06,670 --> 01:28:11,670
this.
I'm trying to figure out the shortest 

1862
01:28:11,670 --> 01:28:15,491
tour thing that I just showed you,
which is this is how I got where I got 

1863
01:28:15,491 --> 01:28:16,760
what to show you is,
is what I was doing with these kids.

1864
01:28:16,761 --> 01:28:19,070
But this,
this wAs my version of this.

1865
01:28:19,070 --> 01:28:22,640
But the kids all had various different 
versions of this and we had,

1866
01:28:22,641 --> 01:28:24,470
um,
somebody suggested,

1867
01:28:25,130 --> 01:28:30,130
let's just enumerate,
let's just look at all possible 

1868
01:28:30,130 --> 01:28:33,530
permutations of these cities and figure 
out what their distances are.

1869
01:28:33,531 --> 01:28:36,830
There's the histograM of those.
That's what we get from those.

1870
01:28:36,831 --> 01:28:39,380
Okay.
How do you get the largest distance from

1871
01:28:39,381 --> 01:28:39,980
those,
et cetera.

1872
01:28:39,981 --> 01:28:40,670
Terror,
terror.

1873
01:28:40,970 --> 01:28:42,890
And this is okay.
This was my version of that.

1874
01:28:42,960 --> 01:28:46,730
The kids had similar stuff and this is,
you know,

1875
01:28:46,790 --> 01:28:47,810
this is,
I think,

1876
01:28:47,910 --> 01:28:49,900
and it probably went off into,
oh,

1877
01:28:49,990 --> 01:28:54,990
there we go.
There's the one for the whole whole 

1878
01:28:54,990 --> 01:28:57,370
earth.
And then they wanted to know how do you 

1879
01:28:57,370 --> 01:28:59,111
do that in three d?
So I was showing them how to convert to 

1880
01:28:59,111 --> 01:28:59,111
x,
y,

1881
01:28:59,111 --> 01:29:02,970
z coordinates in three d and make the 
corresponding thing in three d.

1882
01:29:03,240 --> 01:29:06,240
So what's.
This maybe isn't the.

1883
01:29:07,080 --> 01:29:08,730
This is a random example from yesterday.

1884
01:29:08,730 --> 01:29:11,340
So it's not,
not a highly considered example,

1885
01:29:11,341 --> 01:29:12,210
but,
but,

1886
01:29:12,211 --> 01:29:13,240
um,
uh,

1887
01:29:13,260 --> 01:29:18,260
what I think is interesting is that we 
seem to have finally reached the point 

1888
01:29:18,260 --> 01:29:22,521
where we've automated enough of the 
actual doing of the computation that the

1889
01:29:22,771 --> 01:29:27,360
kids can be exposed mostly to thinking 
about what you might want to compute.

1890
01:29:27,870 --> 01:29:32,870
And you know,
part of our role in language design as 

1891
01:29:32,870 --> 01:29:35,961
far as I'm concerned,
is to get it as much as possible to the 

1892
01:29:35,961 --> 01:29:35,961
point where,
for example,

1893
01:29:35,961 --> 01:29:37,080
you can do a bunch of natural language 
input,

1894
01:29:37,440 --> 01:29:42,440
you can do things which make it as easy 
as possible for kids to not get mixed up

1895
01:29:42,721 --> 01:29:44,460
in the kind of what the,
you know,

1896
01:29:44,461 --> 01:29:49,461
how the computation gets done,
but rather to just think about how you 

1897
01:29:49,461 --> 01:29:49,461
formulate the computation.
So for example,

1898
01:29:49,461 --> 01:29:51,750
a typical example I've used a bunch of 
times in,

1899
01:29:51,850 --> 01:29:56,850
you know,
what does it mean to write code versus 

1900
01:29:56,850 --> 01:29:56,850
do other things.

1901
01:29:56,850 --> 01:29:58,140
Like a,
a typical sort of test example would be,

1902
01:29:58,560 --> 01:30:00,490
I dunno you,
you asked somebody a,

1903
01:30:00,580 --> 01:30:01,920
you're gonna,
there's practical problem.

1904
01:30:01,921 --> 01:30:06,921
We had them alpha.
You give a lat long position on the 

1905
01:30:06,921 --> 01:30:08,280
earth and you say you're going to make a
map that lat long position.

1906
01:30:08,281 --> 01:30:10,860
What,
what scale of map should you make?

1907
01:30:11,540 --> 01:30:13,350
The lat,
long as in the middle of the pacific,

1908
01:30:13,560 --> 01:30:17,280
making a 10 mile radius map isn't very 
interesting.

1909
01:30:17,610 --> 01:30:20,610
Fits in the middle of manhattan.
A 10 mile radius map might be quite,

1910
01:30:20,670 --> 01:30:25,670
quite a sensible thing to do.
So the question has come up with an 

1911
01:30:25,670 --> 01:30:26,460
algorithm and come up with even a way of
thinking about that question.

1912
01:30:26,490 --> 01:30:27,670
What do you do?
You know,

1913
01:30:27,800 --> 01:30:30,360
how should you figure that out while you
might say,

1914
01:30:30,570 --> 01:30:31,020
you know,
oh,

1915
01:30:31,021 --> 01:30:33,510
let's look at the visual complexity of 
the image.

1916
01:30:33,540 --> 01:30:37,490
Let's look at how far it is to another 
city that's far.

1917
01:30:37,550 --> 01:30:38,970
You know,
there are various different things,

1918
01:30:38,971 --> 01:30:43,830
but thinking about that as a kind of 
computational thinking exercise that um,

1919
01:30:44,970 --> 01:30:46,590
uh,
is um,

1920
01:30:46,980 --> 01:30:47,310
uh,
you know,

1921
01:30:47,311 --> 01:30:52,311
that's the kind of thing.
So in terms of what one automates and 

1922
01:30:52,311 --> 01:30:52,710
whether,
whether people need to understand how it

1923
01:30:52,711 --> 01:30:56,000
works inside.
Okay.

1924
01:30:56,490 --> 01:31:01,490
Main point is you'll,
in the end it will not be possible to 

1925
01:31:01,861 --> 01:31:05,470
know how it works inside.
So you might as well stop having that be

1926
01:31:05,471 --> 01:31:06,480
a criterion.
I mean,

1927
01:31:06,481 --> 01:31:11,481
that is,
there are plenty of things that weren't 

1928
01:31:11,481 --> 01:31:11,481
teachers,
people that are,

1929
01:31:11,481 --> 01:31:11,481
let's say,
in,

1930
01:31:11,481 --> 01:31:14,460
in lots of areas of biology,
medicine,

1931
01:31:14,461 --> 01:31:16,200
whatever else,
you know,

1932
01:31:16,260 --> 01:31:18,390
maybe we'll know how it works inside one
day,

1933
01:31:18,570 --> 01:31:20,790
but you can still,
there's an awful lot of useful stuff you

1934
01:31:20,791 --> 01:31:22,830
can teach without knowing how it works 
inside.

1935
01:31:23,250 --> 01:31:26,400
And I think also as we get to 
computation to be more efficient,

1936
01:31:26,401 --> 01:31:28,920
inevitably we will be dealing with 
things where you don't know how it works

1937
01:31:28,921 --> 01:31:29,370
inside.

1938
01:31:29,580 --> 01:31:30,000
Now,
you know,

1939
01:31:30,001 --> 01:31:33,750
we've seen this in math education 
because I've happened to make tools that

1940
01:31:33,751 --> 01:31:36,660
automate a bunch of things that people 
do in math education.

1941
01:31:37,110 --> 01:31:39,390
And I think,
well,

1942
01:31:39,391 --> 01:31:40,740
to tell a silly story,
I mean,

1943
01:31:40,741 --> 01:31:42,540
my,
my older daughter,

1944
01:31:42,541 --> 01:31:45,370
who at some point in the past was doing 
calculus,

1945
01:31:45,540 --> 01:31:47,250
you know,
and learning doing intervals and things.

1946
01:31:47,251 --> 01:31:49,320
And I was saying to her,
you know,

1947
01:31:49,321 --> 01:31:52,730
I didn't think humans still did that 
stuff anymore.

1948
01:31:53,070 --> 01:31:55,380
Um,
which was a very unending comment.

1949
01:31:55,381 --> 01:31:57,420
But um,
but,

1950
01:31:57,450 --> 01:31:58,430
but in any case,
I mean the,

1951
01:31:58,500 --> 01:31:58,860
the,
you know,

1952
01:31:58,910 --> 01:32:03,910
the,
a question of whether do humans need to 

1953
01:32:03,910 --> 01:32:06,721
know how to do that stuff or not.
So I haven't done an integral by hand 

1954
01:32:06,721 --> 01:32:10,130
and probably 35 years that's true.
More or less true that.

1955
01:32:10,570 --> 01:32:13,300
But when I was using computers to do 
them,

1956
01:32:13,990 --> 01:32:17,790
the I was for awhile in Hawaii,
I used to do physics and so on.

1957
01:32:17,790 --> 01:32:20,290
I use computers to the stuff.
I was a really,

1958
01:32:20,291 --> 01:32:24,430
really good integrator except that it 
wasn't really me.

1959
01:32:24,431 --> 01:32:27,040
It was me plus the computer.
So how did that come to be?

1960
01:32:27,041 --> 01:32:32,041
Well,
the answer was that because I was doing 

1961
01:32:32,041 --> 01:32:34,381
things by computer,
I was able to try zillions of examples 

1962
01:32:34,381 --> 01:32:38,040
and I got a much better intuition that 
most people got for how these things 

1963
01:32:38,040 --> 01:32:38,320
would work,
roughly how,

1964
01:32:38,321 --> 01:32:40,990
what you did to make the thing go and so
on.

1965
01:32:41,260 --> 01:32:46,260
Whereas people who are like,
I'm just working this one thing out by 

1966
01:32:46,260 --> 01:32:46,260
hand.
You get a different,

1967
01:32:46,260 --> 01:32:46,260
you know,
you,

1968
01:32:46,260 --> 01:32:47,710
you don't get that intuition.
So I think,

1969
01:32:47,910 --> 01:32:48,790
you know,
two points.

1970
01:32:48,940 --> 01:32:53,940
First of all this,
how do you think about things 

1971
01:32:53,940 --> 01:32:57,271
computationally?
How do you formulate the question 

1972
01:32:57,271 --> 01:32:59,431
computationally that's really important 
and something that we are now in a 

1973
01:32:59,431 --> 01:33:02,170
position I think to actually teach and 
it is not really something you teach by,

1974
01:33:02,580 --> 01:33:03,640
you know,
teaching,

1975
01:33:03,810 --> 01:33:05,140
you know,
traditional quotes,

1976
01:33:05,141 --> 01:33:07,210
coding,
because a lot of that is.

1977
01:33:07,210 --> 01:33:08,440
Okay,
we're going to make a loop.

1978
01:33:08,441 --> 01:33:12,040
We're going to define variables.
I just as I think I probably have a copy

1979
01:33:12,041 --> 01:33:12,460
here.
Yeah,

1980
01:33:12,790 --> 01:33:17,790
the,
I wrote this book for this book kind of 

1981
01:33:17,790 --> 01:33:19,540
for kids about oral language except it 
seems to be useful to adults as well,

1982
01:33:19,541 --> 01:33:21,940
but I wrote it for kids.
So it's,

1983
01:33:21,941 --> 01:33:22,750
um,
I'm,

1984
01:33:22,870 --> 01:33:26,090
one of the amusing things in this book 
is it doesn't talk it.

1985
01:33:26,140 --> 01:33:30,010
Talk about assigning values to variables
until chapter 38.

1986
01:33:30,790 --> 01:33:33,370
So in other words,
that will be a thing that you would find

1987
01:33:33,371 --> 01:33:35,350
in chapter one of most,
you know,

1988
01:33:35,830 --> 01:33:38,590
low level programming,
coding type type things.

1989
01:33:38,591 --> 01:33:40,870
It turns out it's not that relevant to 
know how to do that.

1990
01:33:41,080 --> 01:33:45,340
it's also kind of confusing and I'm uh,
not necessarily.

1991
01:33:45,341 --> 01:33:47,090
And so,
no,

1992
01:33:47,140 --> 01:33:52,140
in terms of the,
you asked where will we get in trouble 

1993
01:33:52,140 --> 01:33:52,140
when people don't know how this stuff 
works inside.

1994
01:33:52,140 --> 01:33:54,250
Um,
that's,

1995
01:33:54,310 --> 01:33:55,310
I mean,
you know,

1996
01:33:55,330 --> 01:33:58,570
I think one just has to get used to that
because it's like,

1997
01:33:58,630 --> 01:33:59,290
you know,
you might say,

1998
01:33:59,291 --> 01:34:02,770
well we live in the world and it's full 
of natural processes where we don't know

1999
01:34:02,771 --> 01:34:06,940
how they work inside,
but somehow we managed to survive and we

2000
01:34:06,941 --> 01:34:11,941
go to a lot of effort to do natural 
science to try and figure out how stuff 

2001
01:34:11,941 --> 01:34:13,450
works inside.
But it turns out we can still use plenty

2002
01:34:13,451 --> 01:34:15,460
of things even when we don't know how 
they work inside.

2003
01:34:15,750 --> 01:34:17,520
We don't need to know.
um,

2004
01:34:17,590 --> 01:34:19,000
and I think the,
um,

2005
01:34:19,070 --> 01:34:21,430
I mean I think the main point is 
computational error,

2006
01:34:21,431 --> 01:34:26,431
reducibility guarantees that we will be 
using things where we don't know and 

2007
01:34:26,431 --> 01:34:28,660
can't know how they work inside.
And you know,

2008
01:34:28,661 --> 01:34:29,890
I think the,
the,

2009
01:34:29,891 --> 01:34:34,260
perhaps the thing that is a little bit,
you know,

2010
01:34:34,360 --> 01:34:37,710
to me a little bit unfortunate as a,
you know,

2011
01:34:38,020 --> 01:34:40,330
as a typical human type thing.

2012
01:34:40,660 --> 01:34:43,330
The fact that I can readily see that,
you know,

2013
01:34:43,390 --> 01:34:48,390
the ai stuff we build is sort of 
effectively creating languages and 

2014
01:34:48,611 --> 01:34:53,200
things that are completely outside of 
the domain to understand and where by by

2015
01:34:53,201 --> 01:34:54,700
that I mean,
you know,

2016
01:34:55,030 --> 01:34:56,920
our human language,
but that's 50,000

2017
01:34:56,930 --> 01:35:01,930
words or whatever has been developed 
over the last however many tens of 

2018
01:35:01,930 --> 01:35:05,261
thousands of years.
And as a society we've developed this 

2019
01:35:05,261 --> 01:35:05,630
way of communicating and explaining 
things.

2020
01:35:05,970 --> 01:35:10,970
You know,
the ais are reproducing that process 

2021
01:35:10,970 --> 01:35:12,250
very quickly,
but they're coming up with a,

2022
01:35:12,251 --> 01:35:13,820
an,
a historical,

2023
01:35:14,100 --> 01:35:14,960
you know,
something,

2024
01:35:15,050 --> 01:35:20,050
you know,
that way of describing the world that 

2025
01:35:20,050 --> 01:35:20,050
doesn't happen to relate at all to our 
historical way of doing it.

2026
01:35:20,120 --> 01:35:21,620
And that's um,
you know,

2027
01:35:21,740 --> 01:35:24,290
it's a little bit disquieting to me as a
human that,

2028
01:35:24,291 --> 01:35:24,740
that,
you know,

2029
01:35:24,790 --> 01:35:26,780
are things going on inside where I know 
it is.

2030
01:35:26,940 --> 01:35:31,940
You know,
in principle I could learn that 

2031
01:35:31,940 --> 01:35:33,791
language,
but it's not the historical one that 

2032
01:35:33,791 --> 01:35:34,350
we've all learned.

2033
01:35:34,760 --> 01:35:39,760
And it really wouldn't make a lot of 
sense to do that because you learn it 

2034
01:35:39,760 --> 01:35:42,131
for one ai and then another one gets 
trained and it's going to use something 

2035
01:35:42,131 --> 01:35:42,590
different.
So it's some.

2036
01:35:42,830 --> 01:35:44,810
But my main,
I guess my main point for,

2037
01:35:45,050 --> 01:35:50,050
for education.
So another point about education I just 

2038
01:35:50,050 --> 01:35:50,050
make,
which is something I haven't figured out

2039
01:35:50,050 --> 01:35:50,050
but,
but um,

2040
01:35:50,050 --> 01:35:52,610
just is um,
you know,

2041
01:35:52,850 --> 01:35:57,850
when do we get to make a good model for 
the human learner using machine 

2042
01:35:57,850 --> 01:35:58,850
learning?
So in other words,

2043
01:35:59,100 --> 01:36:00,560
you know,
part of what we're trying to do,

2044
01:36:00,561 --> 01:36:02,690
like,
like I've got that automated proof,

2045
01:36:02,990 --> 01:36:07,990
I would really like to manage to figure 
out a way what is the best way to 

2046
01:36:07,990 --> 01:36:09,230
present that proof so human can 
understand it.

2047
01:36:09,740 --> 01:36:14,740
And basically for that we have to have a
bunch of heuristics about how humans 

2048
01:36:14,740 --> 01:36:16,340
understand things.
So as an example,

2049
01:36:16,460 --> 01:36:21,460
if we're doing,
let's say a lot of visualization stuff 

2050
01:36:21,460 --> 01:36:21,460
and wolfram language,
okay,

2051
01:36:21,460 --> 01:36:23,390
we have tried to automate to automate it
aesthetics.

2052
01:36:23,810 --> 01:36:27,080
So what we're doing is we're laying out 
a graph.

2053
01:36:27,500 --> 01:36:31,190
What way of laying out that graph is 
most likely for humans to understand it.

2054
01:36:31,610 --> 01:36:34,520
And we've done that by building a bunch 
of heuristics and so on,

2055
01:36:34,760 --> 01:36:36,440
but that's an example of,
you know,

2056
01:36:36,441 --> 01:36:41,441
if we could do that for learning and we 
say what's the optimal path given that 

2057
01:36:41,441 --> 01:36:42,320
the person is trying to understand this 
proof,

2058
01:36:42,321 --> 01:36:47,321
for example,
what's the optimal path to lead them 

2059
01:36:47,321 --> 01:36:49,931
through understanding that proof.
I suspect we will learn a lot more and 

2060
01:36:49,931 --> 01:36:51,830
probably fairly small number of years 
about that.

2061
01:36:52,010 --> 01:36:53,410
And it will be the case that,
you know,

2062
01:36:53,630 --> 01:36:55,850
for example,
if you've got,

2063
01:36:56,270 --> 01:36:58,730
oh I don't know,
you can do simple things like you know,

2064
01:36:58,731 --> 01:37:01,250
you go to wikipedia and you look at what
the path of,

2065
01:37:01,410 --> 01:37:02,030
you know,
how do you,

2066
01:37:02,031 --> 01:37:04,460
if you want to learn this concept,
what are the concepts you have to learn?

2067
01:37:04,790 --> 01:37:09,790
We have much more detailed symbolic 
information about what is actually 

2068
01:37:09,790 --> 01:37:11,480
necessary to know in order to understand
this.

2069
01:37:11,481 --> 01:37:12,650
And so on.
It is,

2070
01:37:12,651 --> 01:37:17,651
I think,
reasonably likely that we will be able 

2071
01:37:17,651 --> 01:37:17,651
to.
I mean if I look at.

2072
01:37:17,651 --> 01:37:20,060
I was interested recently in the history
of math education.

2073
01:37:20,090 --> 01:37:24,290
so I wanted to look at the complete sort
of path of math textbooks.

2074
01:37:24,850 --> 01:37:26,060
You know,
for the past,

2075
01:37:26,120 --> 01:37:27,590
well basically the,
uh,

2076
01:37:27,620 --> 01:37:29,870
like 1200,
you know,

2077
01:37:30,050 --> 01:37:32,840
even actually produced this one of the 
early math textbooks.

2078
01:37:33,080 --> 01:37:36,440
So there'd been these different ways of 
teaching math and you know,

2079
01:37:36,441 --> 01:37:41,441
I think we've,
we've gradually evolved a fairly 

2080
01:37:41,441 --> 01:37:41,720
optimized way for the typical person 
though.

2081
01:37:41,721 --> 01:37:46,721
It's probably the variation of the 
population is not well understood for 

2082
01:37:46,721 --> 01:37:47,750
you know,
how to explain certain concepts.

2083
01:37:47,960 --> 01:37:52,960
And we've gone through some pretty weird
ways of doing it from the 16 hundreds 

2084
01:37:52,960 --> 01:37:55,590
and so on were which have gone out of 
style and possibly,

2085
01:37:55,640 --> 01:37:58,020
you know,
who knows what that's because of.

2086
01:37:58,350 --> 01:37:59,340
Well,
but anyway,

2087
01:37:59,341 --> 01:37:59,880
so,
so,

2088
01:38:00,000 --> 01:38:05,000
you know,
we've kind of learned this path of 

2089
01:38:05,000 --> 01:38:06,801
what's the optimal way to explain adding
fractions or something for humans for 

2090
01:38:06,801 --> 01:38:08,940
the typical human.
But I think we'll learn a lot more about

2091
01:38:08,941 --> 01:38:09,750
how,
you know,

2092
01:38:09,751 --> 01:38:14,751
by,
by essentially making a model for the 

2093
01:38:14,751 --> 01:38:14,751
human.
A machine model for the human will learn

2094
01:38:14,751 --> 01:38:15,780
more about how to,
um,

2095
01:38:16,170 --> 01:38:17,280
you know,
how to optimize,

2096
01:38:17,281 --> 01:38:20,250
how to explain stuff to humans,
a coming attraction.

2097
01:38:20,800 --> 01:38:21,010
But

2098
01:38:22,230 --> 01:38:24,570
by the way,
do you think we're close to that at all?

2099
01:38:24,600 --> 01:38:25,290
Because you,
you,

2100
01:38:25,291 --> 01:38:28,980
you said that there's a,
something in wolfram alpha that,

2101
01:38:29,040 --> 01:38:31,250
that presents the human a nice,
our.

2102
01:38:31,251 --> 01:38:32,910
Where are we,
how far?

2103
01:38:32,940 --> 01:38:34,500
He said coming attraction,
tenure.

2104
01:38:34,610 --> 01:38:39,610
All right.
So I mean in that explaining stuff to 

2105
01:38:39,610 --> 01:38:44,501
humans thing is a lot of human work 
right now being able to automate 

2106
01:38:45,020 --> 01:38:47,030
explaining stuff to humans.
Okay.

2107
01:38:47,031 --> 01:38:51,230
So some of these things but see,
I mean,

2108
01:38:51,231 --> 01:38:56,231
so an interesting question actually just
today I was working on something that's 

2109
01:38:56,231 --> 01:38:56,930
related to this.
Yeah,

2110
01:38:56,931 --> 01:38:57,300
it's,
it's,

2111
01:38:57,360 --> 01:39:00,140
it's being able to,
um,

2112
01:39:00,590 --> 01:39:02,480
the question is given a whole bunch of,
can we,

2113
01:39:02,481 --> 01:39:07,481
for example,
train a machine learning system from 

2114
01:39:07,481 --> 01:39:10,901
explanations that it can see roughly can
we train it to give explanations that 

2115
01:39:10,901 --> 01:39:12,770
are likely to be understandable?
Maybe.

2116
01:39:13,400 --> 01:39:15,170
I think the.
Okay.

2117
01:39:15,171 --> 01:39:17,210
So an example that I'd like to do.
Okay.

2118
01:39:17,240 --> 01:39:22,240
I'd like to do a debugging assistant 
where the typical thing is program runs 

2119
01:39:22,240 --> 01:39:24,620
program gives wrong answer.
Human says,

2120
01:39:24,680 --> 01:39:26,960
why did you get the wrong way?
Did it give the wrong answer?

2121
01:39:27,260 --> 01:39:32,260
Well,
the first piece of information to the 

2122
01:39:32,260 --> 01:39:32,260
computer is that was the human thought.

2123
01:39:32,260 --> 01:39:36,010
That was the wrong answer because the 
computer just did what it was told and 

2124
01:39:36,010 --> 01:39:36,530
it didn't know that was supposed to be 
the wrong answer.

2125
01:39:36,531 --> 01:39:38,030
So then the question is,
can you,

2126
01:39:38,031 --> 01:39:39,010
in fact,
you know,

2127
01:39:39,100 --> 01:39:44,100
in that domain,
can you actually have a reasonable 

2128
01:39:44,100 --> 01:39:47,951
conversation in which the human is 
explaining the computer what they 

2129
01:39:47,951 --> 01:39:51,371
thought it was supposed to do.
The computer is explaining what 

2130
01:39:51,371 --> 01:39:51,371
happened,
why did it happen?

2131
01:39:51,371 --> 01:39:52,940
And so on.
Same thing for math tutoring.

2132
01:39:53,390 --> 01:39:53,890
Um,
you know,

2133
01:39:53,900 --> 01:39:55,550
we have a lot of,
you know,

2134
01:39:55,551 --> 01:39:56,810
we've got a lot of stuff,
you know,

2135
01:39:56,811 --> 01:40:01,811
we're,
we're sort of very widely used for 

2136
01:40:01,811 --> 01:40:01,910
people who want to understand the steps 
in math,

2137
01:40:02,200 --> 01:40:07,200
you know,
can we make a thing where people tell 

2138
01:40:07,200 --> 01:40:07,200
us?
I think it's this.

2139
01:40:07,200 --> 01:40:07,200
okay,
I'll tell you one,

2140
01:40:07,200 --> 01:40:11,540
one little factoid which I did work out.
so if you do multi arithmetic,

2141
01:40:11,570 --> 01:40:12,590
multi digital edition.

2142
01:40:12,890 --> 01:40:14,090
Okay.
Okay.

2143
01:40:14,091 --> 01:40:17,780
So the,
the basis of this is kind of silly,

2144
01:40:17,810 --> 01:40:18,550
silly thing,
but,

2145
01:40:18,551 --> 01:40:23,551
but you know,
if you get the right answer for an 

2146
01:40:23,551 --> 01:40:23,551
audition some.
Okay.

2147
01:40:23,551 --> 01:40:25,760
You don't get very much information.
The student gives the wrong answer.

2148
01:40:26,060 --> 01:40:28,190
The question is can you tell them where 
they went wrong?

2149
01:40:28,900 --> 01:40:33,900
So I'd say you have afforded in addition
some and the student gives the wrong 

2150
01:40:33,900 --> 01:40:37,451
answer.
Can you back trace and figure out what 

2151
01:40:37,451 --> 01:40:37,910
they likely did wrong?
And the answer is you can you,

2152
01:40:38,040 --> 01:40:41,120
you just make this graph of all the 
different things that can happen,

2153
01:40:41,320 --> 01:40:46,320
you know,
when did they know there are certain 

2154
01:40:46,320 --> 01:40:48,611
things that are more common,
transposing numbers and things or you 

2155
01:40:48,611 --> 01:40:48,710
know,
having a one on a mixed up,

2156
01:40:48,740 --> 01:40:53,080
those kinds of things you can with very 
high probability given afforded addition

2157
01:40:53,110 --> 01:40:58,110
some with the wrong answer.
You can Say this is the mistake you 

2158
01:40:58,110 --> 01:41:01,381
made,
which is sort of interesting and that's 

2159
01:41:01,381 --> 01:41:04,600
being done in a fairly symbolic way.
Whether one can do that in a,

2160
01:41:04,780 --> 01:41:09,780
you know,
more machine learning kind of way for 

2161
01:41:09,780 --> 01:41:09,780
more complicated directions.
I'm not sure,

2162
01:41:09,780 --> 01:41:11,350
but that's a,
that's one that works.

2163
01:41:11,860 --> 01:41:14,170
The.
Yeah.

2164
01:41:14,490 --> 01:41:16,090
I just had a followup question.

2165
01:41:16,950 --> 01:41:18,310
So do you think,
uh,

2166
01:41:18,330 --> 01:41:20,000
you know,
like in the future it is,

2167
01:41:20,080 --> 01:41:25,080
is it wasn't moved to simulate virtual 
environment which can actually 

2168
01:41:25,111 --> 01:41:28,750
understand how the human mind works and 
then build a,

2169
01:41:28,770 --> 01:41:33,770
you know,
like finite state machines inside of 

2170
01:41:33,770 --> 01:41:33,770
this watch and environment,
uh,

2171
01:41:33,770 --> 01:41:37,941
to,
to provide a better learning experience 

2172
01:41:37,941 --> 01:41:38,340
and a more personalized learning 
experience.

2173
01:41:39,180 --> 01:41:39,510
Well,
I mean,

2174
01:41:39,511 --> 01:41:40,860
so the question is if,
if,

2175
01:41:41,130 --> 01:41:43,720
if you're going to,
you know,

2176
01:41:43,770 --> 01:41:48,770
can you optimize if you're playing a 
video game or something and that video 

2177
01:41:48,770 --> 01:41:51,741
game is supposed to be educational,
can you optimize the experience based on

2178
01:41:52,320 --> 01:41:54,450
a model of you so to speak?
Yeah,

2179
01:41:54,451 --> 01:41:56,820
I'm sure the answer is yes.
And I'm sure the,

2180
01:41:56,821 --> 01:42:01,821
you know,
the question of how complicated the 

2181
01:42:01,821 --> 01:42:01,821
model of you will be as an interesting 
question.

2182
01:42:01,821 --> 01:42:03,030
They don't know the answer to.
I mean I've,

2183
01:42:03,210 --> 01:42:04,740
I've kind of wondered a similar 
question.

2184
01:42:04,741 --> 01:42:09,741
So I,
I'm a kind of personal analytics 

2185
01:42:09,741 --> 01:42:10,310
enthusiastic.
I collect tons of data about myself.

2186
01:42:10,820 --> 01:42:15,820
I mean,
I do it mostly because it's been super 

2187
01:42:15,820 --> 01:42:15,820
easy to do and I've done it for like 30 
years and I have,

2188
01:42:15,820 --> 01:42:20,661
you know,
every key stroke I've typed on a 

2189
01:42:20,661 --> 01:42:20,661
computer,
like every keystroke I've typed here and

2190
01:42:20,661 --> 01:42:24,800
the screen of my computer every,
every 30 seconds or so of maybe 15 

2191
01:42:24,800 --> 01:42:25,320
seconds,
I'm not sure it does.

2192
01:42:25,320 --> 01:42:28,140
A screenshot is a super boring movie to 
watch.

2193
01:42:28,141 --> 01:42:33,141
But anyway,
I've been collecting all this stuff and 

2194
01:42:33,141 --> 01:42:35,721
so a question that I've asked is,
is there enough data that a bot of me 

2195
01:42:35,721 --> 01:42:37,620
could be made?
Other words,

2196
01:42:37,930 --> 01:42:40,140
do I have enough data about,
you know,

2197
01:42:40,141 --> 01:42:42,780
I've got,
I've written a million emails,

2198
01:42:43,490 --> 01:42:46,200
I have all of those.
I've received 3 million emails.

2199
01:42:46,450 --> 01:42:50,490
I'm over that period of time.
I've got endless,

2200
01:42:50,540 --> 01:42:51,930
you know,
things I've typed,

2201
01:42:52,000 --> 01:42:52,550
et cetera,
et cetera,

2202
01:42:52,551 --> 01:42:53,760
et cetera.
You know,

2203
01:42:53,761 --> 01:42:57,900
is there enough data to reconstruct you 
know me?

2204
01:42:57,960 --> 01:43:01,350
Basically,
I think the answer is probably yes.

2205
01:43:01,890 --> 01:43:04,020
Not sure,
But I think the answer's probably yes.

2206
01:43:04,290 --> 01:43:08,160
And so the question is in an environment
where you're interacting with some video

2207
01:43:08,161 --> 01:43:09,270
game,
trying to learn something,

2208
01:43:09,271 --> 01:43:10,470
whatever else,
you know,

2209
01:43:10,471 --> 01:43:15,471
how long is it going to be before it can
learn enough about you to change that 

2210
01:43:15,471 --> 01:43:17,640
environment in a way that's useful for 
explaining the next thing to you?

2211
01:43:18,120 --> 01:43:21,240
I would guess I would guess that have 
done that.

2212
01:43:21,241 --> 01:43:24,240
This is comparatively easy.
I might be wrong,

2213
01:43:24,241 --> 01:43:25,020
but,
but um,

2214
01:43:25,340 --> 01:43:26,400
uh,
and that the,

2215
01:43:26,470 --> 01:43:27,630
um,
I mean,

2216
01:43:27,631 --> 01:43:28,200
I think,
you know,

2217
01:43:28,220 --> 01:43:30,960
it's an interesting thing because no 
one's dealing with,

2218
01:43:31,060 --> 01:43:33,030
you know,
there's a space of human personalities.

2219
01:43:33,031 --> 01:43:35,100
There's a space of human learning 
styles,

2220
01:43:35,430 --> 01:43:40,430
you know,
I'm sort of always interested in the 

2221
01:43:40,430 --> 01:43:40,430
space of all possible x,
y,

2222
01:43:40,430 --> 01:43:40,680
z,
and there's,

2223
01:43:40,800 --> 01:43:41,880
you know,
there's that question of,

2224
01:43:41,881 --> 01:43:43,650
well,
how do you parameterize the space of all

2225
01:43:43,651 --> 01:43:48,360
possible human learning styles and is 
there a way that we will learn,

2226
01:43:48,361 --> 01:43:49,920
you know,
like,

2227
01:43:50,100 --> 01:43:55,100
can we do that symbolically and say 
these are 10 learning styles or is it 

2228
01:43:55,100 --> 01:43:59,291
something.
I think that's the case Where it's 

2229
01:43:59,291 --> 01:43:59,291
better to use,
you know,

2230
01:43:59,291 --> 01:44:03,250
sort of soft machine learning type 
methods to kind of feel out that space.

2231
01:44:08,410 --> 01:44:09,920
Maybe very last question.

2232
01:44:10,660 --> 01:44:14,560
I was just intuitively thinking when you
spoke about an ocean,

2233
01:44:14,561 --> 01:44:17,800
I thought of isaac newton when he said,
uh,

2234
01:44:18,390 --> 01:44:20,080
uh,
you know,

2235
01:44:20,081 --> 01:44:21,850
the famous quote,
I might not,

2236
01:44:22,240 --> 01:44:25,000
and I thought instead of newton on the 
beach,

2237
01:44:25,030 --> 01:44:27,880
what a friends list.
Where there a,

2238
01:44:27,881 --> 01:44:30,680
what question would he ask?
What would he say?

2239
01:44:30,681 --> 01:44:35,681
And I'm trying to understand your,
the alien ocean and humans through maybe

2240
01:44:39,671 --> 01:44:41,080
franz liszt and music.

2241
01:44:42,410 --> 01:44:44,180
well,
so I mean,

2242
01:44:44,200 --> 01:44:45,700
the,
the quote from newton is,

2243
01:44:45,750 --> 01:44:46,360
is,
um,

2244
01:44:46,670 --> 01:44:49,750
a sort of an interesting quote.
I think it goes something like this if,

2245
01:44:49,870 --> 01:44:52,340
you know,
uh,

2246
01:44:53,240 --> 01:44:56,950
people are talking about how wonderful 
calculus and all that kind of thing are.

2247
01:44:56,980 --> 01:44:59,100
And newton says,
uh,

2248
01:44:59,210 --> 01:45:00,350
you know,
to others,

2249
01:45:00,351 --> 01:45:01,880
I may seem like I've done a lot of 
stuff,

2250
01:45:01,881 --> 01:45:06,340
but to me I seem like a child who,
who picked up a particularly elegance,

2251
01:45:06,370 --> 01:45:07,840
you know,
seashell on the,

2252
01:45:07,841 --> 01:45:11,090
on the beach.
And I've been studying this seashell for

2253
01:45:11,091 --> 01:45:16,091
awhile.
Even though there's this ocean of truth 

2254
01:45:16,091 --> 01:45:16,091
out there waiting to be discovered,
that's roughly the quote.

2255
01:45:16,091 --> 01:45:21,030
Okay.
I find that quote interesting for the 

2256
01:45:21,030 --> 01:45:21,030
following reason.
The,

2257
01:45:21,030 --> 01:45:22,920
what newton did was,
you know,

2258
01:45:23,150 --> 01:45:28,150
calculus and things like it.
If yoU look at the computational 

2259
01:45:28,150 --> 01:45:30,140
universe of all possible programs,
there is a small corner.

2260
01:45:30,141 --> 01:45:32,510
Newton was exactly right and what he 
said that his,

2261
01:45:32,660 --> 01:45:36,680
he picked off calculus,
which is a corner of the possible things

2262
01:45:36,681 --> 01:45:41,681
that can happen in the computational 
universe that happened to be an elegant 

2263
01:45:41,681 --> 01:45:42,050
seashells,
so to speak.

2264
01:45:42,260 --> 01:45:45,820
They happened to be a case where you can
figure out what's going on and uh,

2265
01:45:45,980 --> 01:45:50,980
and so on,
while there is still the sort of ocean 

2266
01:45:50,980 --> 01:45:50,980
of,
uh,

2267
01:45:50,980 --> 01:45:52,940
of other sort of computational 
possibilities out there.

2268
01:45:52,990 --> 01:45:53,490
Uh,
but,

2269
01:45:53,570 --> 01:45:54,550
but when it comes to,
you know,

2270
01:45:54,560 --> 01:45:56,010
you're asking about music.
I,

2271
01:45:56,110 --> 01:46:01,110
oH,
I think my computer stopped being able 

2272
01:46:01,110 --> 01:46:01,890
to get anywhere but,
but sort of interest in the,

2273
01:46:02,450 --> 01:46:04,520
uh,
see if we can get to the site.

2274
01:46:05,090 --> 01:46:10,090
So this is a,
this is a website that we made years ago

2275
01:46:11,330 --> 01:46:13,220
and now my computer isn't playing on a 
thing,

2276
01:46:13,221 --> 01:46:18,221
but let's try that.
Okay.

2277
01:46:23,981 --> 01:46:28,981
So these things are created by basically
just searching computational universe of

2278
01:46:29,351 --> 01:46:34,351
possible programs.
It's sort of interesting because 

2279
01:46:34,351 --> 01:46:37,380
everyone has kind of a story.
Some of them look more interesting than 

2280
01:46:37,380 --> 01:46:37,380
others.
Let's try that one

2281
01:46:44,800 --> 01:46:45,310
anyway.

2282
01:46:45,580 --> 01:46:46,440
The,
the um,

2283
01:46:46,960 --> 01:46:48,340
what's,
what's interesting,

2284
01:46:49,360 --> 01:46:53,100
what was interesting to me about this 
was this is a very trivial,

2285
01:46:53,190 --> 01:46:58,190
you know,
what this is doing is very trivial at 

2286
01:46:58,190 --> 01:46:58,190
some level.
It's just,

2287
01:46:58,190 --> 01:46:58,590
it actually happens to use cellular 
automata.

2288
01:46:58,830 --> 01:47:01,860
You can even have it show you,
I think someplace here.

2289
01:47:02,160 --> 01:47:07,160
Where is it?
Somewhere there's a way of showIng your 

2290
01:47:07,160 --> 01:47:07,160
show the evolution.
This is,

2291
01:47:07,160 --> 01:47:08,910
this is showing the behind the scenes 
what was actually happening,

2292
01:47:09,660 --> 01:47:12,270
what it chose to use to generate that 
musical piece.

2293
01:47:12,580 --> 01:47:13,930
Um,
and uh,

2294
01:47:15,120 --> 01:47:16,830
what I thought was interesting about 
this site,

2295
01:47:18,060 --> 01:47:19,170
I thought,
well,

2296
01:47:19,230 --> 01:47:21,750
you know,
howard computers be relevant to music,

2297
01:47:21,751 --> 01:47:22,250
etc.
Etc.

2298
01:47:22,310 --> 01:47:22,950
Etc.
Well,

2299
01:47:23,150 --> 01:47:28,150
you know,
what would happen is a human would have 

2300
01:47:28,150 --> 01:47:29,640
an idea and then the computer would kind
of dress up that idea and then,

2301
01:47:29,670 --> 01:47:34,670
you know,
a bunch of years go by and I talked to 

2302
01:47:34,670 --> 01:47:35,130
people who are composers and things and 
they say,

2303
01:47:35,160 --> 01:47:36,240
oh yeah,
I really liked that.

2304
01:47:36,270 --> 01:47:37,320
Well,
from town site,

2305
01:47:37,800 --> 01:47:38,970
okay,
that's nice.

2306
01:47:39,270 --> 01:47:44,270
They say it,
it's a very good place for me to get 

2307
01:47:44,270 --> 01:47:45,600
ideas.
So that's sort of the opposite of what I

2308
01:47:45,601 --> 01:47:48,300
would've expected.
Namely what's happening is,

2309
01:47:48,590 --> 01:47:50,550
you know,
human comes here,

2310
01:47:50,790 --> 01:47:54,180
you know,
listens to some ten second fragment.

2311
01:47:54,750 --> 01:47:55,920
And they said,
oh,

2312
01:47:55,921 --> 01:47:59,730
that's an interesting idea.
And then they kind of embellish it using

2313
01:47:59,731 --> 01:48:02,010
kind of something that is humanly 
meaningful,

2314
01:48:02,250 --> 01:48:03,660
but it's like,
you know,

2315
01:48:03,720 --> 01:48:08,720
you're taking a photograph and you see 
some interest in configuration and then 

2316
01:48:08,720 --> 01:48:08,910
kind of your,
you know,

2317
01:48:08,911 --> 01:48:10,980
you're filling that with kind of some 
human,

2318
01:48:11,290 --> 01:48:13,620
a sort of context.
Um,

2319
01:48:13,650 --> 01:48:14,280
but,
uh,

2320
01:48:14,490 --> 01:48:17,060
but,
so I'm not quite sure what,

2321
01:48:17,770 --> 01:48:19,310
um,
uh,

2322
01:48:20,700 --> 01:48:22,340
what you were asking about.
I mean,

2323
01:48:22,380 --> 01:48:25,720
back to the newton quote,
the thing that I think has some,

2324
01:48:26,320 --> 01:48:29,010
uh,
another way to think about that quote is

2325
01:48:29,400 --> 01:48:30,850
us humans,
you know,

2326
01:48:31,020 --> 01:48:33,930
with our sort of historical development 
of,

2327
01:48:34,010 --> 01:48:39,010
you know,
our intellectual history have explored 

2328
01:48:39,010 --> 01:48:43,160
this very small corner of what's 
possible in the computational universe 

2329
01:48:43,160 --> 01:48:46,260
and everything that we care about is 
contained in the small corner.

2330
01:48:46,770 --> 01:48:48,020
And that means that,
you know,

2331
01:48:48,060 --> 01:48:49,590
you could say,
well,

2332
01:48:49,591 --> 01:48:50,880
gee,
you know,

2333
01:48:50,970 --> 01:48:53,270
I want to know what w,
w,

2334
01:48:53,271 --> 01:48:58,271
w,
what we end up wanting to talk about 

2335
01:48:58,271 --> 01:49:00,780
other things that we as a society have 
decided we care about and what.

2336
01:49:00,830 --> 01:49:03,470
There's an interesting feedback loop I 
just mentioned it should end,

2337
01:49:03,480 --> 01:49:04,290
but,
but,

2338
01:49:04,291 --> 01:49:06,300
um,
so you might say,

2339
01:49:07,320 --> 01:49:08,430
so here's,
here's a funny thing.

2340
01:49:08,431 --> 01:49:10,320
So let's take language,
for example,

2341
01:49:10,560 --> 01:49:12,370
language evolves.
We say we,

2342
01:49:12,410 --> 01:49:15,180
we make up language to describe what we 
see in the world.

2343
01:49:15,570 --> 01:49:16,740
Okay,
fine,

2344
01:49:17,130 --> 01:49:20,460
that's a fine idea.
Imagine the paleolithic times,

2345
01:49:20,610 --> 01:49:25,610
people will make up language.
They probably didn't have a word for 

2346
01:49:25,610 --> 01:49:25,610
table because they didn't have any 
tables.

2347
01:49:26,340 --> 01:49:31,340
They probably had a word for rock.
But then we ended up as a result of the 

2348
01:49:31,531 --> 01:49:32,980
particular,
you know,

2349
01:49:33,000 --> 01:49:36,570
development that our civilization has 
gone through.

2350
01:49:36,571 --> 01:49:41,571
We build tables and there was sort of a 
synergy between coming up with a word 

2351
01:49:41,941 --> 01:49:46,941
for table and deciding tables were a 
thing and we should build a bunch of 

2352
01:49:46,941 --> 01:49:46,941
them.

2353
01:49:46,941 --> 01:49:51,290
And so there's this sort of complicated 
interplay between the things that we 

2354
01:49:51,290 --> 01:49:55,021
learn,
how to describe and how to think about 

2355
01:49:55,021 --> 01:49:57,390
the things that we build and put an our 
environment and then the things that we 

2356
01:49:57,390 --> 01:50:01,890
end up wanting to talk about because 
there are things that we have 

2357
01:50:01,890 --> 01:50:02,740
experienced in our environment.
And so that's the,

2358
01:50:02,850 --> 01:50:07,850
you know,
I think as we look at sort of the 

2359
01:50:07,850 --> 01:50:07,850
progress of civilization,
there's,

2360
01:50:07,850 --> 01:50:07,870
you know,
there's various layers of.

2361
01:50:08,110 --> 01:50:09,670
First we,
you know,

2362
01:50:09,700 --> 01:50:12,850
we invented a thing that we can then 
think about and talk about.

2363
01:50:13,330 --> 01:50:16,120
Then we build an environment based on 
that.

2364
01:50:16,630 --> 01:50:19,840
Then that allows us to do more stuff and
we build on top of that.

2365
01:50:19,841 --> 01:50:20,910
And that's why,
for example,

2366
01:50:20,911 --> 01:50:25,911
when we talk about computational 
thinking and teaching it to kids and so 

2367
01:50:25,911 --> 01:50:28,441
on,
that's one reason that's kind of 

2368
01:50:28,441 --> 01:50:30,811
important because we're building a layer
of things that people are then familiar 

2369
01:50:30,811 --> 01:50:32,380
with that's different from what we've 
had so far.

2370
01:50:32,560 --> 01:50:34,020
And they give people a way to talk about
things.

2371
01:50:34,030 --> 01:50:36,590
I'll give you one example that I'm 
seated.

2372
01:50:36,640 --> 01:50:38,230
I have that still up the

2373
01:50:39,190 --> 01:50:40,140
uh,
okay.

2374
01:50:40,260 --> 01:50:41,070
One,
one.

2375
01:50:41,130 --> 01:50:44,710
One example here,
uh,

2376
01:50:47,170 --> 01:50:48,730
from this blog post of mine.
Actually.

2377
01:50:49,000 --> 01:50:49,660
So

2378
01:50:50,900 --> 01:50:52,360
the.
Alright,

2379
01:50:52,430 --> 01:50:53,980
is it?
Okay.

2380
01:50:53,981 --> 01:50:54,850
So that,

2381
01:50:56,280 --> 01:50:58,620
that thIng,
there is a nested pattern,

2382
01:50:58,990 --> 01:50:59,470
you know,
it's a,

2383
01:50:59,730 --> 01:51:01,110
it's a penske,

2384
01:51:01,570 --> 01:51:03,650
um,
that,

2385
01:51:04,950 --> 01:51:05,430
that

2386
01:51:05,470 --> 01:51:08,030
tile pattern was created in 12,
10,

2387
01:51:08,070 --> 01:51:08,590
80.

2388
01:51:09,340 --> 01:51:14,340
okay.
that's the first example I know of a 

2389
01:51:14,340 --> 01:51:14,340
fractal pattern.
Okay.

2390
01:51:14,340 --> 01:51:19,140
Well,
the art historians wrote about these 

2391
01:51:19,140 --> 01:51:22,651
patterns.
There are a bunch of his particular 

2392
01:51:22,651 --> 01:51:22,651
style or pattern they wrote about these 
for years.

2393
01:51:22,651 --> 01:51:25,880
They never diScussed that nest pattern.
These patterns also have,

2394
01:51:25,881 --> 01:51:30,881
you know,
pictures of lions and elephants and 

2395
01:51:30,881 --> 01:51:31,030
things like that.
And then they wrote about those kinds of

2396
01:51:31,031 --> 01:51:36,031
things,
but they never mentioned the nested 

2397
01:51:36,031 --> 01:51:37,921
pattern until basically about 25 years 
ago when fractals and so on became a 

2398
01:51:39,761 --> 01:51:41,140
thing.
And then it's,

2399
01:51:41,170 --> 01:51:42,970
oh,
I can now talk about that.

2400
01:51:42,971 --> 01:51:44,680
It's a nested patterns,
fractal.

2401
01:51:44,980 --> 01:51:45,990
And then,
you know,

2402
01:51:46,180 --> 01:51:51,180
before that time,
the art historians were blind to that 

2403
01:51:51,180 --> 01:51:51,400
particular part of this pattern.
It was just like,

2404
01:51:51,401 --> 01:51:53,230
I don't know what that is,
that there's no,

2405
01:51:53,260 --> 01:51:54,820
you know,
I don't have a word to describe it.

2406
01:51:54,850 --> 01:51:58,780
I'M not going to,
I'm not going to talk about it.

2407
01:51:58,780 --> 01:51:59,360
So that's a,
you know,

2408
01:51:59,370 --> 01:52:04,120
it's part of this feedback loop of,
of things that we learn to describe.

2409
01:52:04,121 --> 01:52:07,150
Then we build in terms of those things.
Then we built another layer.

2410
01:52:07,420 --> 01:52:09,310
I think one of the things,
I mean you talk about,

2411
01:52:09,610 --> 01:52:13,180
you know,
just in the sort of thing,

2412
01:52:13,340 --> 01:52:16,240
one thing I'm really interested in is 
the evolution of purposes.

2413
01:52:16,480 --> 01:52:19,330
So if you look back in human history,
there's a,

2414
01:52:19,500 --> 01:52:24,500
you know,
what was thought to be worth doing a 

2415
01:52:24,500 --> 01:52:25,030
thousand years ago is different from 
what's thought to be worth doing today.

2416
01:52:25,480 --> 01:52:27,040
And part of that is,
is,

2417
01:52:27,041 --> 01:52:28,280
um,
uh,

2418
01:52:28,570 --> 01:52:33,570
you know,
good examples of things like walking on 

2419
01:52:33,570 --> 01:52:35,050
a treadmill or buying goods and virtual 
worlds.

2420
01:52:35,260 --> 01:52:40,260
Both of theSe are hard to explain to 
somebody from a thousand years ago 

2421
01:52:40,260 --> 01:52:42,850
because each one ends up being a whole 
sort of societal story about we're doing

2422
01:52:42,851 --> 01:52:44,500
this because we do that because we do 
that.

2423
01:52:44,830 --> 01:52:47,960
And so the question is how will these 
purposes evolve in the future?

2424
01:52:48,410 --> 01:52:53,410
And I think one of the things that I 
view as a sort of sobering thought is 

2425
01:52:53,410 --> 01:52:56,801
that that term,
actually one thing I found rather 

2426
01:52:56,801 --> 01:53:01,120
disappointing and then I became less 
pessimistic about it is if you think 

2427
01:53:01,120 --> 01:53:01,820
about the future of the human condition 
and you know,

2428
01:53:01,821 --> 01:53:06,821
we'd been successful in making ai 
systems and we can read out brains and 

2429
01:53:06,821 --> 01:53:08,000
we can upload consciousnesses and things
like that.

2430
01:53:08,001 --> 01:53:11,240
And we've actually got this box with 
trillions of souls in it.

2431
01:53:11,630 --> 01:53:13,520
And the question is,
what are these souls doing?

2432
01:53:13,910 --> 01:53:18,910
And to us today,
it looks like they're playing video 

2433
01:53:18,910 --> 01:53:18,910
games.
So the rest of eternity.

2434
01:53:19,550 --> 01:53:21,740
And that seems like a kind of a bad 
outcome.

2435
01:53:21,741 --> 01:53:25,280
It's like we've gone through all of this
long history and what do we end up with?

2436
01:53:25,281 --> 01:53:30,281
We end up with a trillion souls in a box
playing video games and I thought this 

2437
01:53:31,221 --> 01:53:34,010
is a very depressing outcome,
so to speak.

2438
01:53:34,520 --> 01:53:39,520
And then I realized that that actually,
if you look at the sort of arc of human 

2439
01:53:39,520 --> 01:53:42,830
history people,
are there any given time in history,

2440
01:53:43,100 --> 01:53:45,550
people have been.
uh,

2441
01:53:48,690 --> 01:53:51,470
my main conclusion is that any time in 
history,

2442
01:53:51,471 --> 01:53:56,471
the things people do seem meaningful and
purposeful to them at that time in 

2443
01:53:56,471 --> 01:53:59,450
history and history moves on and you 
know,

2444
01:53:59,451 --> 01:54:03,560
like a thousand years ago,
there were a lot of purposes that people

2445
01:54:03,561 --> 01:54:08,561
had that you know what to do with weird 
superstitions and things like that that 

2446
01:54:08,561 --> 01:54:10,100
we say,
why the heck were you doing that?

2447
01:54:10,101 --> 01:54:12,360
That just doesn't make any sense.
Right?

2448
01:54:12,380 --> 01:54:15,470
But to them at that time,
it made all the sense in the world.

2449
01:54:15,800 --> 01:54:16,830
And I think that,
you know,

2450
01:54:16,940 --> 01:54:19,640
the thing that makes me sort of less 
depressed about the future,

2451
01:54:19,820 --> 01:54:22,580
so to speak,
is that at any given time in history,

2452
01:54:22,800 --> 01:54:26,150
you know,
you can still have meaningful purposes.

2453
01:54:26,420 --> 01:54:31,420
Even thOugh they may not look meaningful
from a different point in history and 

2454
01:54:31,420 --> 01:54:34,361
that sort of a whole theory,
you can kind of build up based on kind 

2455
01:54:34,361 --> 01:54:37,691
of the trajectories that you've followed
through the space of purposes and sort 

2456
01:54:37,691 --> 01:54:38,360
of interesting.
If you can jump,

2457
01:54:38,420 --> 01:54:43,420
like you say,
let's get cryonically frozen for 300 

2458
01:54:43,420 --> 01:54:47,471
years and then be back again.
The the interest in cases.

2459
01:54:47,661 --> 01:54:51,200
Then you knoW all the purposes that you 
sort of,

2460
01:54:51,680 --> 01:54:54,590
you know,
that you find yourself in ones that have

2461
01:54:54,591 --> 01:54:57,620
any continuity with what we know today.
I should stop with that.

2462
01:54:57,621 --> 01:54:58,970
That's a beautiful way to end it.

2463
01:54:59,650 --> 01:55:00,300
Yeah.
