00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:02,910
The following is a conversation
with Arielle Vinnie Alice.

2
00:00:03,300 --> 00:00:05,730
He's a senior research
scientist at Google deep mind,

3
00:00:05,940 --> 00:00:09,020
and before that he was a Google
brain and Berkeley. Okay.

4
00:00:09,180 --> 00:00:12,840
His research has been
cited over 39,000 times.

5
00:00:13,320 --> 00:00:17,310
He's truly one of the most brilliant
and impactful minds in the field of deep

6
00:00:17,311 --> 00:00:20,880
learning. He's behind some of the
biggest papers and ideas and AI,

7
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:25,320
including sequence to sequence learning,
audio generation, image captioning,

8
00:00:25,540 --> 00:00:29,370
neural machine translation,
and of course reinforcement learning.

9
00:00:29,790 --> 00:00:33,900
He's a lead researcher of the Alpha
Star Project, creating an agent,

10
00:00:33,930 --> 00:00:37,530
the defeated a top professional
at the game of starcraft.

11
00:00:38,070 --> 00:00:41,580

r I, d. And now here's my conversation,

15
00:00:53,790 --> 00:00:55,280
Arielle Minneapolis,

16
00:00:56,520 --> 00:01:01,350
you spearheaded the deepmind team behind
Alpha Star that recently beat a top

17
00:01:01,351 --> 00:01:02,700
professional players,
starcraft,

18
00:01:04,020 --> 00:01:09,020
so you have an incredible wealth of
work and deep learning and a bunch of

19
00:01:09,181 --> 00:01:13,740
fields. But let's talk about
starcraft first. Let's go
back to the very beginning,

20
00:01:13,741 --> 00:01:18,630
even before Alpha Star, before deep
mine, before deep learning first,

21
00:01:18,810 --> 00:01:21,270
what came first for you?

22
00:01:21,271 --> 00:01:24,300
A love for programming or
a love for video games?

23
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:27,720
I think for me it definitely came first.

24
00:01:28,520 --> 00:01:31,400
The drive to play video games.

25
00:01:31,940 --> 00:01:34,490
I really liked computers.

26
00:01:35,290 --> 00:01:37,750
I do and really coats much.

27
00:01:37,780 --> 00:01:41,800
But what I would do is I would just mess
with the computer, break it and fix it.

28
00:01:42,070 --> 00:01:46,390
That was the level of skills, I guess
that again, in my very early days,

29
00:01:46,391 --> 00:01:50,920
I mean when I was 10 or 11 and then I,
I really got into video games,

30
00:01:50,980 --> 00:01:53,230
especially starcraft,
actually the first version,

31
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:57,250
I spent most of my time just playing
kind of pseudo professionally as

32
00:01:57,251 --> 00:02:01,000
professionally as you could
play back in 98 in Europe,

33
00:02:01,030 --> 00:02:05,590
which was not very main scene leg
that what's called nowadays e-sports,

34
00:02:05,830 --> 00:02:08,080
right? Of course, in the 90s. So, uh,

35
00:02:08,690 --> 00:02:11,360
how'd you get into starcraft?
What, what was your favorite race?

36
00:02:11,660 --> 00:02:15,050
How do you develop, how did
you develop your skill? What,

37
00:02:15,210 --> 00:02:17,750
what was your strategy,
all that kind of thing.

38
00:02:18,010 --> 00:02:21,460
So as a player I tended to
try to play not many games,

39
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:25,030
not to kind of disclose the
strategies that I kind of developed.

40
00:02:25,420 --> 00:02:29,530
And I like to play random,
actually not in competitions but just to,

41
00:02:30,070 --> 00:02:31,480
I think in starcraft there's,

42
00:02:31,540 --> 00:02:35,530
well there's three main races and I
found it very useful to play with all of

43
00:02:35,531 --> 00:02:36,550
them.
Um,

44
00:02:36,580 --> 00:02:41,140
so I would choose random many times even
sometimes in tournaments to gain skill

45
00:02:41,141 --> 00:02:45,460
on the three races because it's
not how you play against someone,

46
00:02:45,461 --> 00:02:48,670
but also if you understand
the race because you played,

47
00:02:48,730 --> 00:02:52,540
you also understand what's annoying,
what then when you're on the other side,

48
00:02:52,541 --> 00:02:57,160
what to do to annoy that person to try
to gain advantages here and there and so

49
00:02:57,161 --> 00:03:01,720
on. So I actually played random, I
must say in terms of favorite race,

50
00:03:02,020 --> 00:03:03,500
I really liked [inaudible].
Um,

51
00:03:03,580 --> 00:03:08,580
I was probably best at circ and that's
probably what I tend to use towards the

52
00:03:08,831 --> 00:03:12,820
end of my career before
starting university. So
let's step back a little bit.

53
00:03:13,300 --> 00:03:17,470
Could you try to describe starcraft two
people that may never have played video

54
00:03:17,471 --> 00:03:21,980
games, especially the massively
online variety like starcraft.

55
00:03:22,750 --> 00:03:27,750
Starcraft is a real time strategy game.
And the way to think about starcraft,

56
00:03:27,790 --> 00:03:31,960
perhaps if you understand the beat chess,
is that there are,

57
00:03:32,050 --> 00:03:35,770
there's a board which is called
mapper or, or like, yeah,

58
00:03:35,771 --> 00:03:38,920
like the mob where people
play against each other.

59
00:03:39,130 --> 00:03:40,960
There's obviously many ways you can play,

60
00:03:40,961 --> 00:03:45,460
but the most interesting one is the one
versus one set up where you just play

61
00:03:45,461 --> 00:03:50,060
against someone, someone else or even the
built in Ai, right? The laser put, uh,

62
00:03:50,130 --> 00:03:53,800
a system that can play the game reasonably
well if you don't know how to play.

63
00:03:54,490 --> 00:03:58,660
And then in this board you have again,
pieces like in chess,

64
00:03:58,661 --> 00:04:02,320
but these pieces are not there initially.
Like they are in chess.

65
00:04:02,320 --> 00:04:07,320
You actually need to decide to gather
resources to decide which pieces to build.

66
00:04:07,870 --> 00:04:12,700
So in a way you starting almost with no
pieces, you start gathering resources.

67
00:04:12,701 --> 00:04:15,820
In starcraft, there's minerals
and gas that you can gather.

68
00:04:16,210 --> 00:04:20,020
And then you must decide how much
do you want to focus, for instance,

69
00:04:20,021 --> 00:04:23,770
on gathering more resources or
starting to build units or pieces.

70
00:04:24,370 --> 00:04:29,260
And then once you have enough
pieces or maybe like attack,

71
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:32,140
um,
you a a good attack composition,

72
00:04:32,141 --> 00:04:35,110
then you go and attack
the other side of the map.

73
00:04:35,500 --> 00:04:39,460
And now the other main difference with
Chaz is that you don't see the other side

74
00:04:39,461 --> 00:04:42,910
of the map. So you're not
seeing the moves of the enemy.

75
00:04:43,390 --> 00:04:45,070
It's what we call partially observable.

76
00:04:45,460 --> 00:04:50,460
So as a result that you must not only
decide trading of economy versus building

77
00:04:51,101 --> 00:04:52,000
your own units,

78
00:04:52,300 --> 00:04:56,820
but you also must decide whether you
want to scout to gather information. Um,

79
00:04:56,860 --> 00:05:00,460
but also by scouting you might be giving
away some information that you might be

80
00:05:00,461 --> 00:05:04,960
hiding from the enemy. So there's a
lot of complex decision making, um,

81
00:05:04,990 --> 00:05:07,570
all in real time.
There's also unlike chess,

82
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:10,150
this is not a turn based game.

83
00:05:10,151 --> 00:05:13,690
You play basically all
the time continuously.

84
00:05:13,691 --> 00:05:18,010
And thus some skill in terms of speed
and accuracy of clicking is also very

85
00:05:18,011 --> 00:05:18,844
important.

86
00:05:18,940 --> 00:05:23,260
And people that train for these really
play this game at at an amazing skill

87
00:05:23,261 --> 00:05:27,130
level. I've seen many times, these
are new, if you can witness these,

88
00:05:27,131 --> 00:05:29,440
life is really, really impressive. Um,

89
00:05:29,441 --> 00:05:33,220
so in a way it's kind of a chess where
you then see the other side of the board.

90
00:05:33,330 --> 00:05:37,600
You were building your own pieces and
you'll also need to gather resources to

91
00:05:37,780 --> 00:05:42,370
basically get some money to build other
buildings, pieces, technology and so on.

92
00:05:42,940 --> 00:05:44,950
From the perspective of the human player.

93
00:05:45,130 --> 00:05:48,450
The difference between that
and chess or maybe that and uh,

94
00:05:48,690 --> 00:05:50,800
a game like turn based strategy,

95
00:05:50,801 --> 00:05:55,801
like here's a mighty magic is that there's
an anxiety because you have to make

96
00:05:56,681 --> 00:05:58,430
these decisions really quickly.

97
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:03,800
And if you are not actually
aware of what decisions work it,

98
00:06:04,571 --> 00:06:06,170
it's a very stressful,
balanced.

99
00:06:06,171 --> 00:06:08,900
The of everything you described
is actually quite stressful,

100
00:06:08,901 --> 00:06:11,570
difficult to balance for
a amateur human player.

101
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:13,880
I don't know if it gets easier
at the professional level,

102
00:06:14,180 --> 00:06:16,490
like if they're fully aware
of what they have to do.

103
00:06:16,491 --> 00:06:20,480
But at the amateur level there's this
anxiety, oh crap, I'm being attacked.

104
00:06:20,481 --> 00:06:24,380
Oh crap. I have to uh, build up
resources. Oh, I have to probably expand.

105
00:06:24,381 --> 00:06:26,120
And all these,
the time,

106
00:06:26,150 --> 00:06:30,350
the a real time strategy aspect is
really stressful and computation.

107
00:06:30,351 --> 00:06:33,200
I'm sure difficult. We'll
get into it. But, uh,

108
00:06:34,050 --> 00:06:34,883
for me

109
00:06:35,070 --> 00:06:40,070
battlenet s so starcraft was
released in [inaudible] 98,

110
00:06:41,670 --> 00:06:44,520
20 years ago. It was
just hard to believe. Uh,

111
00:06:44,640 --> 00:06:49,640
and a blizzard battlenet
with a Diablo in 96 came out.

112
00:06:50,190 --> 00:06:52,560
And to me it might be
a narrow perspective,

113
00:06:52,561 --> 00:06:57,210
but it changed online gaming and
perhaps society forever. Yeah.

114
00:06:57,240 --> 00:07:02,070
But I may have made way too narrow
viewpoint. But from your perspective,

115
00:07:02,300 --> 00:07:06,780
uh, can you talk about the history
of gaming over the past 20 years?

116
00:07:06,990 --> 00:07:09,640
Is this how transformational,

117
00:07:09,641 --> 00:07:12,580
how important is this line of games?

118
00:07:12,770 --> 00:07:17,390
Right. So I think I kind of
was an active gamer. Wiles.

119
00:07:17,391 --> 00:07:20,540
These was developing the
Internet, um, online gaming.

120
00:07:20,541 --> 00:07:25,541
So for me that the way it came was I
played other games strategy related,

121
00:07:26,411 --> 00:07:29,980
I played a bit of common and conquer.
And then I played Warcraft two,

122
00:07:30,280 --> 00:07:33,040
which is from blizzard.
But at the time I didn't know,

123
00:07:33,041 --> 00:07:36,970
I didn't understand about what bleeds
or was or anything work off to was just

124
00:07:36,971 --> 00:07:40,270
the game, which is, which was actually
very similar to start in many ways.

125
00:07:40,271 --> 00:07:43,960
It's also real time strategy game
where there's orks and humans.

126
00:07:43,961 --> 00:07:47,830
So there's only two racist. But it
was offline and it was offline, right?

127
00:07:47,950 --> 00:07:52,030
So I remember a friend of mine
came to to school say, oh,

128
00:07:52,031 --> 00:07:54,850
there's this new cool game called
starcraft. And I just said, oh,

129
00:07:54,851 --> 00:07:59,350
this sounds like just a copy of Warcraft
two, um, until I kind of installed it.

130
00:07:59,710 --> 00:08:01,960
And at the time, um, I am from Spain,

131
00:08:01,961 --> 00:08:05,350
so we didn't have intern like very
good internet. Right? So there was,

132
00:08:05,740 --> 00:08:10,740
for us a starcraft became first kind of
an offline experience where you kind of

133
00:08:10,991 --> 00:08:12,940
start to play these missions,
right?

134
00:08:12,941 --> 00:08:15,690
You play against some sort
of scripted things. The,

135
00:08:15,750 --> 00:08:18,950
to double up the story of the
characters in the game. Um,

136
00:08:19,240 --> 00:08:23,220
and then later on I started playing
against the beauty in AI, um,

137
00:08:23,500 --> 00:08:25,720
and I thought it was
impossible to defeat it.

138
00:08:26,110 --> 00:08:29,470
Then eventually you defeat one and you
can actually bring in seven built in the

139
00:08:29,471 --> 00:08:32,500
eyes. At the same time,
we also felt impossible,

140
00:08:32,680 --> 00:08:36,970
but actually it's not that hard
to beat seven [inaudible] at once.

141
00:08:36,971 --> 00:08:41,380
So once we achieve that also we
discovered that we could play,

142
00:08:41,800 --> 00:08:43,810
um, as I said, Internet wasn't that great,

143
00:08:43,840 --> 00:08:45,850
but we could play with the land right on,

144
00:08:45,910 --> 00:08:49,490
like basically against each other
if we were in the same okay.

145
00:08:49,570 --> 00:08:53,380
Plays because you could just connect
machines with like cables, right? Um,

146
00:08:53,620 --> 00:08:57,080
so we started playing in land
mode and against, you know,

147
00:08:57,100 --> 00:08:58,960
as a group of friends and it was really,

148
00:08:58,961 --> 00:09:01,810
really like much more entertaining
than playing against the ice.

149
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:06,310
And later on as Internet was starting
to double up and being a bit faster and

150
00:09:06,311 --> 00:09:09,670
more reliable, then it's when I
started experiencing battlenet,

151
00:09:09,700 --> 00:09:11,560
which is these amazing universe,

152
00:09:11,561 --> 00:09:15,490
not only because of the fact that
you can play the game against anyway,

153
00:09:15,550 --> 00:09:16,450
anyone in the world,

154
00:09:16,451 --> 00:09:21,451
but you can also get to no more
people you just get exposed to now,

155
00:09:21,701 --> 00:09:25,090
like these vast variety of, it's kind
of a bit of when the chats came about,

156
00:09:25,091 --> 00:09:29,020
right? There was a chat system,
you could play against people,

157
00:09:29,021 --> 00:09:32,470
but you could also chat with people not
only about Steiger, but about anything.

158
00:09:32,471 --> 00:09:37,160
And that became a way of life
for kind of two years. Um, and,

159
00:09:37,161 --> 00:09:41,200
and obviously they need became like kind
of exploded in mean that I started to

160
00:09:41,201 --> 00:09:44,170
play more seriously going to
tournaments and so on, so forth.

161
00:09:44,660 --> 00:09:49,430
Do you have a sense and a
societal sociological level,

162
00:09:49,820 --> 00:09:54,380
what's this whole part of society that
many of us are not aware of and it's a

163
00:09:54,381 --> 00:09:57,780
huge part of society, which
is gamers. I mean I'm,

164
00:09:58,910 --> 00:10:02,570
every time I come across that
in youtube or streaming sites,

165
00:10:02,960 --> 00:10:07,370
I mean this is the huge number
of people play games religiously.

166
00:10:07,610 --> 00:10:08,900
Do you have a sense of those folks,

167
00:10:08,901 --> 00:10:12,470
especially now that you've returned to
that realm a little bit and the Ai side?

168
00:10:12,580 --> 00:10:12,881
Yeah,

169
00:10:12,881 --> 00:10:17,620
so in fact I even after stock or if
I actually played world of Warcraft,

170
00:10:17,621 --> 00:10:22,621
which is the main sort of online walls
on presence that you get to interact with

171
00:10:24,071 --> 00:10:26,800
lots of people. So I played
that for a little bit. It was,

172
00:10:27,010 --> 00:10:30,460
to me it was a bit less stressful than
starcraft because winning was kind of a

173
00:10:30,461 --> 00:10:34,380
given. You just put in this world
and you can always complete missions.

174
00:10:34,980 --> 00:10:39,980
But I think it was actually the social
aspect of specialty starcraft first.

175
00:10:40,431 --> 00:10:45,360
And then games like world of
Warcraft really shaped me in,

176
00:10:45,361 --> 00:10:47,650
in a very interesting way because you are,

177
00:10:47,651 --> 00:10:51,640
you get to experience is just people you
wouldn't usually interact with, right?

178
00:10:51,641 --> 00:10:53,260
So even nowadays,

179
00:10:53,261 --> 00:10:57,310
I still have many Facebook friends from
the area where I played online and their

180
00:10:57,311 --> 00:11:00,850
ways of thinkings, even
political. Um, they just don't,

181
00:11:00,851 --> 00:11:03,670
we don't live in it like we don't
interact in the, in the real world,

182
00:11:03,671 --> 00:11:06,310
but we were connected by basically fiber.

183
00:11:06,730 --> 00:11:10,700
And that way I actually get to
understand a bit better, um,

184
00:11:10,780 --> 00:11:12,550
that we live in a diverse world.

185
00:11:12,790 --> 00:11:16,210
And these were just connections that
were made by, because, you know,

186
00:11:16,211 --> 00:11:19,210
I happened to go in a
city in a beautiful city,

187
00:11:19,450 --> 00:11:21,760
a as a priest and I met these,
you know,

188
00:11:21,761 --> 00:11:25,450
these warrior and we became friends and
then we start like playing together.

189
00:11:25,451 --> 00:11:27,110
Right? So I think it's, it's,

190
00:11:27,140 --> 00:11:31,290
it's transformative and more and more
and more people are more aware of it.

191
00:11:31,291 --> 00:11:34,530
I mean, it's, it's becoming quite
mainstream. But back in the day,

192
00:11:34,531 --> 00:11:37,960
as you were saying,
in 2000 2005 even,

193
00:11:38,010 --> 00:11:42,060
it was very still very
strange thing to do,

194
00:11:42,061 --> 00:11:47,040
especially in Europe. I think there
were exceptions like Korea for instance,

195
00:11:47,130 --> 00:11:49,050
it was amazing that that,

196
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:52,200
that everything happened so
early in terms of cyber cafes,

197
00:11:52,201 --> 00:11:56,100
like it's if you go to
sell it gets a CT that um,

198
00:11:56,320 --> 00:11:58,210
back into the starcraft was kind of,

199
00:11:58,390 --> 00:12:03,030
you could be a celebrity by
playing starcraft, but this
was like 99, 2000, right?

200
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:06,130
It's not like recently.
So, um, yeah, it's quite,

201
00:12:06,131 --> 00:12:09,400
it's quite the interesting too
to look back and, and yeah,

202
00:12:09,401 --> 00:12:11,470
I think it's changing
society the same way.

203
00:12:11,471 --> 00:12:15,820
Of course like technology and social
networks and so on are also transforming

204
00:12:15,821 --> 00:12:18,460
things. And a quick tangent, let me ask,

205
00:12:18,461 --> 00:12:23,461
you're also one of the most productive
people in your particular chosen a

206
00:12:24,070 --> 00:12:26,000
passion and path in life.
Uh,

207
00:12:26,410 --> 00:12:29,470
and yet you're also appreciate
and enjoy video games.

208
00:12:29,471 --> 00:12:31,320
Do you think it's possible to do,
uh,

209
00:12:32,680 --> 00:12:35,140
to enjoy video games and moderation?

210
00:12:35,770 --> 00:12:39,860
Someone told me that you could
choose two out of three. Um,

211
00:12:39,880 --> 00:12:43,610
when I was playing video games, you
could choose having a girlfriend, um,

212
00:12:43,690 --> 00:12:45,950
playing video games or studying.
Yeah.

213
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:49,810
And I think for the most
part it was relatively true.

214
00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:53,320
These things do take time.
Uh, games like stock.

215
00:12:53,350 --> 00:12:56,470
If you take the game pretty
seriously and you want to study it,

216
00:12:56,500 --> 00:12:58,810
then you obviously we'll
dedicate more time to it.

217
00:12:59,050 --> 00:13:03,890
And I definitely took gaming and
obviously studying very seriously. I,

218
00:13:03,891 --> 00:13:08,670
I, I love learning
science and et Cetera. Um,

219
00:13:08,680 --> 00:13:12,820
so to me, especially when I
started university Undergrad,

220
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:17,060
I kind of step off starcraft. I
actually fully stopped playing. Um,

221
00:13:17,070 --> 00:13:19,000
and then we'll have worker
of was a bit more casual.

222
00:13:19,001 --> 00:13:23,860
You could just connect online. And I mean,
it was, it was fun. Um, but I, as I said,

223
00:13:23,861 --> 00:13:28,750
that was not as much time investment
as it was for and starcraft.

224
00:13:29,410 --> 00:13:31,540
Okay.
So let's get into Alpha Star.

225
00:13:31,570 --> 00:13:35,100
What are the a year behind the team?
Uh,

226
00:13:35,110 --> 00:13:38,700
so deep mine has been working on starcraft
and released a bunch of cool open

227
00:13:38,701 --> 00:13:40,810
source agents and so on past few years,

228
00:13:41,260 --> 00:13:43,930
but Alpha Star really is the moment where,
uh,

229
00:13:44,590 --> 00:13:48,820
the first time you'd beat
a world class player.

230
00:13:49,090 --> 00:13:53,200
So what are the parameters
of the challenge in the
way that Alpha Star took it

231
00:13:53,201 --> 00:13:58,180
on and how did you and David and the
rest of the deepmind team get into it?

232
00:13:58,210 --> 00:14:02,230
Consider the, you can even beat the
bus in the world or top players.

233
00:14:02,410 --> 00:14:07,060
I think it all started in back in 2015.

234
00:14:07,150 --> 00:14:08,770
Um,
actually I'm lying.

235
00:14:08,771 --> 00:14:13,771
I think it was 2014 when the mine was
acquired by Google and I at the time was

236
00:14:14,951 --> 00:14:18,850
at Google brain, which is in, it was in
California, is still in California. Uh,

237
00:14:18,851 --> 00:14:21,700
we had the summit where we
got together the two groups.

238
00:14:21,780 --> 00:14:25,870
So Google brain and Google deepmind got
together and we gave a series of talks

239
00:14:26,290 --> 00:14:30,280
and given that they were doing deep
reinforcement learning for games,

240
00:14:30,550 --> 00:14:35,050
I decided to bring up part of my past.
Um, we, Jay had developed at Berkeley,

241
00:14:35,051 --> 00:14:38,380
like these things, which we call Berkeley
over mind, which is really just a,

242
00:14:38,381 --> 00:14:40,120
a starcraft one Bot,
right?

243
00:14:40,121 --> 00:14:44,800
So I talked about that and I remember
that means just came to me and said, well,

244
00:14:45,070 --> 00:14:47,110
maybe not now. It's, it's
perhaps a bit too early,

245
00:14:47,111 --> 00:14:51,380
but you should just come to the
mind and do these again. Uh,

246
00:14:51,500 --> 00:14:53,180
with deep reinforcement learning.
Right?

247
00:14:53,690 --> 00:14:57,980
And at the time it sounded very science
fiction for, for several reasons.

248
00:14:58,460 --> 00:15:02,540
Uh, but then in 2016, when I actually
moved to London and joined the mine,

249
00:15:02,590 --> 00:15:04,070
I'm transferring from brain.

250
00:15:04,730 --> 00:15:08,000
It became apparent that because
of the Alphago moment, um,

251
00:15:08,180 --> 00:15:11,570
and kind of bleeds or reaching
out to us to say, wait,

252
00:15:11,810 --> 00:15:15,590
do you want the next challenge? And also
me being full time at deep. So sort of,

253
00:15:15,591 --> 00:15:18,770
kind of all these came
together and then I was,

254
00:15:18,771 --> 00:15:23,570
I went to Irvine in California to the
blizzard headquarters to just chat with

255
00:15:23,571 --> 00:15:27,260
them and try to explain how would
it all work before you do anything.

256
00:15:27,770 --> 00:15:32,770
And the approach has always been
about the learning perspective,

257
00:15:33,441 --> 00:15:38,330
right? So, um, in, in Berkeley we
did a lot of rule based, you know,

258
00:15:38,420 --> 00:15:42,500
conditioning and if you have more
than three units then go attack.

259
00:15:42,500 --> 00:15:46,100
And if the other has more units than me,
I retreat and so on and so forth.

260
00:15:46,370 --> 00:15:49,370
And of course the point of debris
enforcement learning, deep learning,

261
00:15:49,371 --> 00:15:53,060
machine learning in general is that
all these should be learned behavior.

262
00:15:53,390 --> 00:15:58,390
So that kind of was the DNA of the project
since its inception in 2016 where we

263
00:15:59,991 --> 00:16:03,440
just didn't even have an environment
to work with. And so this,

264
00:16:03,441 --> 00:16:05,090
that's how it all started really.

265
00:16:05,810 --> 00:16:09,830
So if you go back to that conversation
with Dennis, or even in your own head,

266
00:16:10,670 --> 00:16:14,060
how far away did you, cause that's,
we're talking about Atari Games.

267
00:16:14,450 --> 00:16:16,670
We're talking about go,
which is kind of,

268
00:16:16,700 --> 00:16:20,990
if you're honest about a really
far away from starcraft in, in, uh,

269
00:16:21,110 --> 00:16:24,890
well now that you've beaten it, maybe you
could say as close, but, uh, it's much,

270
00:16:24,891 --> 00:16:29,891
it seems like starcraft is way harder
than go philosophically in mathematically

271
00:16:30,261 --> 00:16:34,730
speaking. Uh, so how far away
did, did you think you were?

272
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:38,960
Do you think it's 1,019 and 18? You
could be doing as well as you have? Yeah.

273
00:16:38,961 --> 00:16:42,790
When I, when I kind of thought about,
okay, I'm going to dedicate, you know,

274
00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:47,600
a lot of my time and focus on these
and obviously I do a lot of different

275
00:16:47,601 --> 00:16:50,330
research in deep learning.
So spending time on it.

276
00:16:50,331 --> 00:16:53,780
I mean I really had to kind of think
there's going to be something good

277
00:16:53,810 --> 00:16:57,050
happening out of this.
Um, so really I thought,

278
00:16:57,080 --> 00:17:01,430
well these sounds impossible
and it probably is impossible
to do the full thing,

279
00:17:01,550 --> 00:17:05,870
like the all like the full game,
um, where you play one versus one.

280
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:10,910
Um, and it's only a neural network playing
and so on. Um, so it really felt like,

281
00:17:10,940 --> 00:17:14,810
I just didn't even think it was possible.
But on the other hand,

282
00:17:14,811 --> 00:17:18,910
I could see some stepping stones
like towards that goal. Um,

283
00:17:19,040 --> 00:17:23,090
clearly you could define sub problems in
starcraft and sort of dissected a beat

284
00:17:23,091 --> 00:17:26,590
and say, okay, here is a part of
the game. Here is another part. Um,

285
00:17:26,660 --> 00:17:31,220
and also obviously the fact that,
so this was really also critical to me,

286
00:17:31,221 --> 00:17:34,340
the fact that we could
access human replace, right?

287
00:17:34,341 --> 00:17:37,520
So pleaser was very kind and in fact
they open source these for the whole

288
00:17:37,521 --> 00:17:42,521
community where you can just go and
it's not every single stock of game ever

289
00:17:42,591 --> 00:17:42,981
played,

290
00:17:42,981 --> 00:17:47,240
but it's a lot of them you can just go
and download and everyday they will you,

291
00:17:47,241 --> 00:17:48,890
you can just query a data set and say,

292
00:17:48,900 --> 00:17:50,970
well give me all the games
that were played today.

293
00:17:51,630 --> 00:17:56,630
And given my kind of experience with
language and sequences and supervised

294
00:17:57,541 --> 00:18:00,720
learning, I thought, well that's
definitely going to be very helpful.

295
00:18:00,721 --> 00:18:05,721
And something quite unique now because
ever before we had such a large data set

296
00:18:06,691 --> 00:18:11,691
of replays of people playing the game
at this scale of such a complex video

297
00:18:12,151 --> 00:18:15,240
game. Right? So that to me
was a precious resource.

298
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:19,470
And as soon as I knew that [inaudible]
was able to kind of give these to the

299
00:18:19,471 --> 00:18:24,240
community, I started to feel positive
about something [inaudible] happening.

300
00:18:24,270 --> 00:18:28,740
But, but I also thought the full
thing, like really no rules, no,

301
00:18:28,800 --> 00:18:31,470
no single line of code that tries to say,
well,

302
00:18:31,471 --> 00:18:33,840
I mean if you see these units
builds the detector, all these,

303
00:18:34,170 --> 00:18:37,830
I'm not having any of these as
specializations seemed really, really,

304
00:18:37,831 --> 00:18:39,590
really difficult to me intuitively.

305
00:18:39,720 --> 00:18:43,430
I do also like that blizzard
was teasing or even trolling

306
00:18:43,450 --> 00:18:47,740
meal, a sort of almost uh, yeah,

307
00:18:47,741 --> 00:18:50,080
pulling you in into this
really difficult challenge.

308
00:18:50,290 --> 00:18:52,330
Did they have any aware what's,

309
00:18:52,690 --> 00:18:56,980
what's the interest from the perspective
of blizzard except just curiosity?

310
00:18:57,290 --> 00:19:00,770
Yeah, I think believes or has
really understood and really bring,

311
00:19:00,950 --> 00:19:04,770
bring forward this competitiveness
of east ports in the Games.

312
00:19:04,771 --> 00:19:09,771
The starcraft really kind of sparked a
lot of like something that almost was

313
00:19:09,980 --> 00:19:13,340
never seen, especially as I
was saying, eat back in Korea.

314
00:19:13,940 --> 00:19:16,430
So they just probably thought,
wow,

315
00:19:16,450 --> 00:19:20,930
this is such a pure one versus one
setup that it will be great to see, um,

316
00:19:21,140 --> 00:19:26,140
if something that can play Atari or
go and then later on chess could,

317
00:19:26,931 --> 00:19:30,590
could even tackle these kind of
complex real time strategy game. Right.

318
00:19:30,591 --> 00:19:31,730
So for them,

319
00:19:31,731 --> 00:19:36,660
they wanted to see first obviously
whether it was possible, if,

320
00:19:36,670 --> 00:19:40,520
if, if the game they created was in
a way it's solvable to some extent.

321
00:19:40,850 --> 00:19:42,170
And I think on the other hand,

322
00:19:42,171 --> 00:19:45,770
they also are a pretty modern
company that innovates a lot.

323
00:19:45,771 --> 00:19:50,690
So just starting to understand AI for
them to how to bring AI into games is not,

324
00:19:50,990 --> 00:19:54,290
is not AI for games,
but games for AI, right?

325
00:19:54,320 --> 00:19:56,890
I mean both ways I think can work.
And you up,

326
00:19:57,140 --> 00:20:01,250
we obviously at the man use games
for AI, right, to drive AI progress,

327
00:20:01,251 --> 00:20:05,540
but pleaser might actually be able to
do and many other companies to start to

328
00:20:05,541 --> 00:20:06,800
understand and do the opposite.

329
00:20:06,801 --> 00:20:10,880
So I think that is also something they
can get out of these. And they definitely,

330
00:20:11,300 --> 00:20:13,610
we have brainstorm a lot
about about these, right.

331
00:20:13,690 --> 00:20:18,070
But one of the interesting things to
me about starcraft and Diablo and these

332
00:20:18,071 --> 00:20:22,990
games that blizzard is created is the
task of balancing classes, for example,

333
00:20:23,210 --> 00:20:27,460
a sort of making the game
fair from the starting point.

334
00:20:27,461 --> 00:20:31,870
And then let's skill determine
the outcome. Uh, is there, uh,

335
00:20:32,320 --> 00:20:36,730
I mean, can you first comment there's
three races are Protoss and Taryn,

336
00:20:36,760 --> 00:20:40,470
I don't know if I've ever said that out
loud. Is that how you pronounce it, Taryn?

337
00:20:41,510 --> 00:20:44,280
Yeah. Uh, yeah.

338
00:20:44,281 --> 00:20:47,620
I don't think I've ever sold in person
interacted with anybody about starcraft.

339
00:20:47,650 --> 00:20:48,483
It's funny.

340
00:20:48,500 --> 00:20:51,700
Uh,
so they seem to be pretty balanced.

341
00:20:51,730 --> 00:20:54,400
I wonder if the AI,

342
00:20:54,550 --> 00:20:58,960
the work that you're doing with Alpha
Star would help balance them even further.

343
00:20:59,140 --> 00:21:00,520
Is that something you think about?

344
00:21:00,521 --> 00:21:03,820
Is that something that blizzard
is thinking about? Right. So,

345
00:21:03,821 --> 00:21:08,821
so balancing when you add a new need or
a new spell type is obviously possible

346
00:21:09,100 --> 00:21:13,160
given that you can always
train or retrain at scale.

347
00:21:13,161 --> 00:21:16,270
Some agent that might start
using that in unintended ways.

348
00:21:16,660 --> 00:21:21,340
But I think actually if you understand
how starcraft has kind of coy evolve with

349
00:21:21,341 --> 00:21:22,600
players in a way,

350
00:21:22,601 --> 00:21:27,400
I think it's actually very cool the ways
that many of the things and strategies

351
00:21:27,401 --> 00:21:29,930
that people came up with,
right? So I think it's,

352
00:21:30,010 --> 00:21:34,030
we've seen it over and over in starcraft
that bleeds or comes up with maybe a

353
00:21:34,031 --> 00:21:38,200
new unit and then some players get
creative and do something kind of

354
00:21:38,290 --> 00:21:42,310
unintentional or something that blizzard
designers that just simply didn't test

355
00:21:42,311 --> 00:21:43,144
or think about.

356
00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:47,320
And then after that becomes kind of
mainstream in the community bleeds or

357
00:21:47,321 --> 00:21:52,170
patches the gang. And then they kind
of, maybe we can that strategy or,

358
00:21:52,200 --> 00:21:55,030
or make it actually more
interesting but a bit more balanced.

359
00:21:55,390 --> 00:21:58,300
So these kind of continual talk
between players and research,

360
00:21:58,301 --> 00:22:03,301
this is kind of what has defined them
actually in actually most games I the

361
00:22:03,610 --> 00:22:06,400
stacker but also in world of
Warcraft they would do that.

362
00:22:06,420 --> 00:22:10,570
There are several classes and it
would be not good that everyone plays

363
00:22:10,780 --> 00:22:14,560
absolutely the same raise
or and so on. Right. So, um,

364
00:22:14,650 --> 00:22:17,260
I think they do care
about balancing of course.

365
00:22:17,261 --> 00:22:20,830
And they do a fair amount of testing,
but it's also beautiful to,

366
00:22:21,010 --> 00:22:25,120
to also see how players get
creative anyways. And I mean,

367
00:22:25,121 --> 00:22:28,900
whether I can be more creative at this
point. I don't think so. Right. I mean,

368
00:22:28,901 --> 00:22:31,540
it's just sometimes some
things are so amazing happens.

369
00:22:31,541 --> 00:22:36,370
Like I remember back in the days like
you have these drop ships that could drop

370
00:22:36,371 --> 00:22:40,620
the rivers and that was actually not
thought about that you could drop these

371
00:22:40,621 --> 00:22:45,600
unit that has these what's called splash
damage that would basically eliminate

372
00:22:45,601 --> 00:22:47,250
all the enemies workers at once.

373
00:22:47,870 --> 00:22:51,320
No one thought that you could actually
put them in really early game,

374
00:22:51,520 --> 00:22:55,400
do that kind of damaged and then you know,
things changing the game.

375
00:22:55,401 --> 00:22:56,420
But I don't know,
I think there's,

376
00:22:56,480 --> 00:23:00,260
it's quite an amazing exploration
process from both sides.

377
00:23:00,261 --> 00:23:01,580
Players and blizzard alike.

378
00:23:01,790 --> 00:23:05,920
Well it's a, it's almost
like a reinforcement learning
exploration, but any,

379
00:23:05,940 --> 00:23:07,730
the scale of humans that play

380
00:23:09,330 --> 00:23:13,660
that play blizzard games is almost
on the scale of a large scale,

381
00:23:13,680 --> 00:23:17,570
deep mind RL experiment. I mean,
if you look at the numbers, it's,

382
00:23:17,571 --> 00:23:19,490
I mean you're talking about,
I don't know how many games,

383
00:23:19,491 --> 00:23:23,750
but hundreds of thousands
of games. Probably a month.
Yeah. I mean, so you could,

384
00:23:23,810 --> 00:23:27,830
it's almost the same
as running a RL agents.

385
00:23:28,690 --> 00:23:32,770
What aspect of the problem of starcraft
he thinks the hardest. Does it the,

386
00:23:33,160 --> 00:23:35,140
like you said,
the imperfect information,

387
00:23:35,350 --> 00:23:37,930
is it the fact they have
to do long term planning?

388
00:23:38,110 --> 00:23:41,980
Is it the realtime aspects we
have to Duke stuff really quickly?

389
00:23:42,190 --> 00:23:46,070
Is it the fact that a large
action space so you can do so

390
00:23:46,070 --> 00:23:49,640
many possible things?
Or is it the, you know,

391
00:23:49,670 --> 00:23:53,060
in the game theoretic sense there is no
national Glybera at least you don't know

392
00:23:53,061 --> 00:23:57,230
what the optimal strategy
is because there's way too
many options, right? What's,

393
00:23:57,260 --> 00:23:59,450
is there something that stands
out as just like the hardest,

394
00:23:59,451 --> 00:24:00,530
the most annoying thing?

395
00:24:00,950 --> 00:24:05,950
So when we sort of looked at the problem
and start to define the parameters of

396
00:24:07,251 --> 00:24:11,960
it, what are the observations, what are
the actions? Um, it became very apparent.

397
00:24:12,270 --> 00:24:13,940
Um, that's, you know, the,

398
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:18,800
the very first barrier that one would
hit in starcraft would be because of the

399
00:24:18,801 --> 00:24:23,801
action space being so large and as not
being able to search like you could in,

400
00:24:24,261 --> 00:24:28,130
in chess or go, even though
the search space is vast. Um,

401
00:24:28,610 --> 00:24:32,390
the main problem that we identified
was that of exploration. Right?

402
00:24:32,391 --> 00:24:36,170
So without any sort of human
knowledge or human prior.

403
00:24:36,680 --> 00:24:40,250
If you think about starcraft and you
know how deep reinforcement learning

404
00:24:40,370 --> 00:24:41,990
algorithm works work,

405
00:24:41,991 --> 00:24:46,550
which is essentially by issuing random
actions and hoping that they will get

406
00:24:46,551 --> 00:24:48,620
some wins sometimes so they could learn.

407
00:24:49,160 --> 00:24:52,730
So if you think of the of the
action space in starcraft,

408
00:24:52,790 --> 00:24:57,470
almost anything you can do in the early
game is bad because any action involves

409
00:24:57,590 --> 00:25:01,340
taking workers which are
mining minerals for free.

410
00:25:01,341 --> 00:25:05,210
That's something that the game does
automatically sends them to mind and you

411
00:25:05,211 --> 00:25:08,690
would immediately just take them
out of mining and send them around.

412
00:25:09,020 --> 00:25:13,910
So just thinking how,
how is it going to be possible to,

413
00:25:14,150 --> 00:25:19,100
to get to understand that these concepts,
but but even more like expanding, right?

414
00:25:19,250 --> 00:25:19,610
There's,

415
00:25:19,610 --> 00:25:23,360
there's these buildings you can place
in other locations in the map to gather

416
00:25:23,361 --> 00:25:24,141
more resources,

417
00:25:24,141 --> 00:25:28,370
but the location of the building is
important and you have to select a worker,

418
00:25:28,880 --> 00:25:32,630
send it, walking to that
location, build the building,

419
00:25:32,660 --> 00:25:34,070
wait for the building to be built,

420
00:25:34,130 --> 00:25:39,130
and then boot extra workers there so they
start mining that just that feels like

421
00:25:39,501 --> 00:25:40,160
impossible.

422
00:25:40,160 --> 00:25:45,020
If you just randomly click to produce
that state desirable state that then you

423
00:25:45,021 --> 00:25:49,250
could hope to learn from because
eventually that may yield to an extra win.

424
00:25:49,251 --> 00:25:50,360
Right?
So for me,

425
00:25:50,361 --> 00:25:55,340
the exploration problem and due to the
action space and the fact that there's

426
00:25:55,341 --> 00:25:56,091
not really turns,

427
00:25:56,091 --> 00:26:01,091
there's so many turns because the game
essentially teaks at 22 times per second

428
00:26:01,400 --> 00:26:05,150
if you, I mean that's how they
could, is criticize sort of time.

429
00:26:05,510 --> 00:26:07,720
Obviously you always have to
discreet ice time. There's no,

430
00:26:07,740 --> 00:26:09,110
no such thing as real time,

431
00:26:09,590 --> 00:26:13,940
but it's really a lot of time steps
of things that could go wrong.

432
00:26:14,210 --> 00:26:17,940
And that definitely felt
Apriori like the hardest. Um,

433
00:26:17,960 --> 00:26:21,330
you mentioned many good ones. I
think partial observability. Um,

434
00:26:21,340 --> 00:26:25,280
the fact that there is no perfect strategy
because of the Paschal observability

435
00:26:25,520 --> 00:26:26,840
those are very interesting problems.

436
00:26:26,841 --> 00:26:31,040
We start seeing more and more now in
terms of us, we solved the previous ones.

437
00:26:31,041 --> 00:26:33,460
But the core problem to me was,
uh,

438
00:26:33,530 --> 00:26:38,450
exploration and solving it has been
basically kind of the focus and how we saw

439
00:26:38,451 --> 00:26:41,590
the first breakthroughs.
So exploration in a,

440
00:26:41,780 --> 00:26:44,160
in a multi hierarchical way.
So like

441
00:26:44,280 --> 00:26:45,750
22 times a second.

442
00:26:45,850 --> 00:26:49,620
Exploration has a very different meaning
than it does in terms of should I

443
00:26:49,621 --> 00:26:52,980
gather resources early or
should I wait or so on.

444
00:26:53,100 --> 00:26:55,560
And so how do you solve the long term?

445
00:26:56,160 --> 00:27:01,080
Let's talk about the internals
of Alpha Stein. So first of all,

446
00:27:01,081 --> 00:27:04,890
how do you represent the state
of the game, uh, as an input?

447
00:27:05,400 --> 00:27:10,110
How do you then do the longterm sequence
modeling? How do you build a policy?

448
00:27:10,500 --> 00:27:14,220
What, what's the, what's the
architecture like? So out of a star has

449
00:27:15,070 --> 00:27:16,660
obviously several components,

450
00:27:16,840 --> 00:27:20,680
but everything passes through
what we call the policy,

451
00:27:20,860 --> 00:27:22,030
which is a neural network.

452
00:27:22,230 --> 00:27:26,420
And that's kind of the beauty of it there
is I could just now give you a neural

453
00:27:26,421 --> 00:27:30,660
network and some weights and if you
fed the right observations and you

454
00:27:30,661 --> 00:27:32,490
understood the actions the same way we do,

455
00:27:32,520 --> 00:27:35,070
you would have basically
the agent playing the game.

456
00:27:35,100 --> 00:27:39,240
There is absolutely nothing else needed
other than those weights that were

457
00:27:39,241 --> 00:27:40,074
trained.

458
00:27:40,320 --> 00:27:45,320
Now the first step is observing the
game and we've experimented with a few

459
00:27:45,451 --> 00:27:49,250
alternatives.
The one that we currently use mixes,

460
00:27:49,260 --> 00:27:54,260
both spacial sort of images that you
would process from the game that is the

461
00:27:54,361 --> 00:27:55,470
zoomed out version of the,

462
00:27:55,471 --> 00:27:59,970
of the map and also assume the inversion
of the camera or the screen as we call

463
00:27:59,971 --> 00:28:00,804
it,

464
00:28:00,840 --> 00:28:05,840
but also we give to the agent the least
of units that it sees more of as a set

465
00:28:07,920 --> 00:28:12,920
of objects that it can operate on that
is not necessarily required to use it.

466
00:28:14,730 --> 00:28:18,420
And we have versions of the game that
play well without these set vision.

467
00:28:18,421 --> 00:28:21,150
That is not like how
humans perceive the game,

468
00:28:21,630 --> 00:28:26,520
but it certainly helps a lot because it's
a very natural way to encode the game

469
00:28:26,521 --> 00:28:29,340
is by just looking at all the
unions that there are there.

470
00:28:29,341 --> 00:28:33,900
They have properties like
health was Aetion type of unit,

471
00:28:33,960 --> 00:28:35,790
whether it's my unit or the enemies.

472
00:28:36,150 --> 00:28:41,110
And that's sort of is kind of the,
the summary of,

473
00:28:41,120 --> 00:28:42,840
of the state of, of the, of the game.

474
00:28:42,841 --> 00:28:47,040
Not that least of units or set of
units that you see all the time.

475
00:28:47,360 --> 00:28:50,610
Well that's pretty close to the way humans
see the game. Why do you say it's not?

476
00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:54,870
Isn't that a, you're saying the
exactness of it is not only to humans,

477
00:28:55,010 --> 00:28:57,140
the exactness of it is
perhaps not the problem.

478
00:28:57,170 --> 00:29:02,060
I guess maybe the problem if you look
at it from how actually humans play the

479
00:29:02,061 --> 00:29:06,680
game is that they play with a mouse and
a keyboard and a screen and they don't

480
00:29:06,681 --> 00:29:10,150
see sort of a structured object
with all the units, what they see,

481
00:29:10,190 --> 00:29:12,740
what they see on the
screen. Right? Yeah. So

482
00:29:12,830 --> 00:29:14,320
you remember that there's
a siren interrupt.

483
00:29:14,321 --> 00:29:18,580
There's a plot that he showed with
camera based. We do exactly that. Right?

484
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:22,120
Move around. And that seems to
converge to similar performance.

485
00:29:22,170 --> 00:29:22,471
Yeah.

486
00:29:22,471 --> 00:29:26,280
I think that's what we're
kind of experimenting with
what's necessary or not,

487
00:29:26,281 --> 00:29:28,930
but using the set.
So,

488
00:29:28,931 --> 00:29:33,840
so actually if you look at research in
computer region where it makes a lot of

489
00:29:33,841 --> 00:29:37,350
sense to treat images
as two dimensional race,

490
00:29:38,150 --> 00:29:41,400
there is actually a very nice
paper from Facebook, I think. Um,

491
00:29:41,470 --> 00:29:45,880
I forgot who the authors are, but I think
it's, um, part of gaming skills group.

492
00:29:46,330 --> 00:29:51,010
And what they do is they take an image
which is that these two dimensional

493
00:29:51,011 --> 00:29:56,011
signal and they actually take pixel by
Pixel and scramble the image as if it was

494
00:29:56,770 --> 00:29:58,510
just a least of pixels.

495
00:29:58,860 --> 00:30:03,220
And crucially they encode the position
of the pixels with the x y coordinates.

496
00:30:03,670 --> 00:30:06,100
And this is just kind
of a new architecture,

497
00:30:06,101 --> 00:30:09,580
which we incidentally also using
stacked graph called the transformer,

498
00:30:09,790 --> 00:30:11,950
which is a very popular
paper from last year,

499
00:30:11,951 --> 00:30:14,920
which yielded very nice
result in machine translation.

500
00:30:15,520 --> 00:30:20,170
And if you actually believe in this kind
of, oh it's actually a set of pixels,

501
00:30:20,260 --> 00:30:23,110
as long as you encode x
why it's okay then you,

502
00:30:23,140 --> 00:30:27,700
you could argue that the list of units
that we see is precisely that because we

503
00:30:27,701 --> 00:30:32,170
have each unit as a kind of pixel,
if you will, and then their x,

504
00:30:32,171 --> 00:30:36,310
y coordinates. So in that
perspective we, without knowing it,

505
00:30:36,311 --> 00:30:40,380
we use the same architecture that was
shown to work very well on Pascal and

506
00:30:40,381 --> 00:30:44,890
image net and so on. So the interesting
thing here is putting it in that way,

507
00:30:45,400 --> 00:30:50,260
it starts to move a tours the way
usually work with language. So what,

508
00:30:50,980 --> 00:30:55,120
and especially with your expertise
and uh, uh, work in language,

509
00:30:55,480 --> 00:30:58,420
it seems like there's echoes of a lot of,
um,

510
00:30:58,960 --> 00:31:02,320
the way you would work with
natural language in the
way you've approached Alpha

511
00:31:02,320 --> 00:31:03,570
Star right there.
What's,

512
00:31:04,300 --> 00:31:08,980
does that help with the longterm sequenced
modeling there somehow? Exactly. So,

513
00:31:09,010 --> 00:31:13,410
so now that we understand what an
observation for a given time step is, uh,

514
00:31:13,570 --> 00:31:14,890
we need to move on to say,
well,

515
00:31:14,891 --> 00:31:18,520
there's going to be a sequence of
such observations and an agent.

516
00:31:18,521 --> 00:31:23,080
We'll need to given all that he'd seen
not only the current time step but all

517
00:31:23,081 --> 00:31:24,070
that he'd seen.
Why?

518
00:31:24,071 --> 00:31:28,390
Because there is partial observability
we must remember whether we saw a worker

519
00:31:28,391 --> 00:31:29,950
going somewhere for instance,
right?

520
00:31:30,070 --> 00:31:33,100
Because then there might be an
expansion on the top right of the map.

521
00:31:33,580 --> 00:31:37,960
So given that what you
must then think about this,

522
00:31:37,961 --> 00:31:40,330
there is the problem of
given all the observations,

523
00:31:40,360 --> 00:31:44,500
you have to predict the next action.
And not only given all the observations,

524
00:31:44,501 --> 00:31:48,220
but given all the observations and given
all the actions you've taken predict

525
00:31:48,221 --> 00:31:49,054
the next action.

526
00:31:49,300 --> 00:31:53,230
And that sounds exactly like
machine translation where,

527
00:31:53,590 --> 00:31:56,770
and that's exactly how
kind of I saw the problem,

528
00:31:57,130 --> 00:32:02,130
especially when you are given supervised
data or replace from humans because the

529
00:32:02,441 --> 00:32:03,580
problem is exactly the same.

530
00:32:03,580 --> 00:32:08,580
You're translating essentially a prefix
of observations and actions onto what's

531
00:32:09,071 --> 00:32:09,970
going to happen next,

532
00:32:10,150 --> 00:32:13,750
which is exactly how you would train
a model to translate or to generate

533
00:32:13,751 --> 00:32:16,420
language as well. Right? Do
you have a certain prefix?

534
00:32:16,600 --> 00:32:20,380
You must remember everything that comes
in the past because otherwise you might

535
00:32:20,381 --> 00:32:25,010
start having non-coherent text
and the same architectures. Um,

536
00:32:25,060 --> 00:32:30,060
we using LSTM and transformers to operate
on across time to kind of integrate.

537
00:32:30,970 --> 00:32:32,710
All that's happened in the past,

538
00:32:33,010 --> 00:32:37,030
those architectures that work so well
in translation or language malady are

539
00:32:37,031 --> 00:32:42,031
exactly the same than what the agent is
using to issue actions in the game and

540
00:32:42,501 --> 00:32:46,760
the way we train it. Moreover
for imitation, which is
step one of Alpha stories,

541
00:32:47,060 --> 00:32:49,580
take all the human experience
and try to imitate it.

542
00:32:49,820 --> 00:32:54,680
Match like you try to imitate
translators that translated many pairs of

543
00:32:54,681 --> 00:32:56,300
sentences from French to English.

544
00:32:56,300 --> 00:33:00,140
Say that sort of principle
applies exactly the same.

545
00:33:00,150 --> 00:33:04,160
It's almost the same code,
except that instead of words,

546
00:33:04,460 --> 00:33:06,590
you have a slightly more
complicated objects,

547
00:33:06,591 --> 00:33:10,220
which are the observations and the
actions are also a bit more complicated.

548
00:33:10,230 --> 00:33:13,820
That Dan award is there a
self play component then too.

549
00:33:13,910 --> 00:33:17,180
So once you run out of
imitation, right? So,

550
00:33:17,210 --> 00:33:21,800
so indeed you can bootstrap
from human replace,

551
00:33:22,190 --> 00:33:27,190
but then the agents you get are actually
not as good as the humans you imitated.

552
00:33:27,920 --> 00:33:30,650
Right? So how do we imitate, well,

553
00:33:30,651 --> 00:33:35,240
we take humans from 3000 MMR
and hire 3000 and memories.

554
00:33:35,241 --> 00:33:40,241
Just a metric of human skill and 3000
and [inaudible] might be like 50%

555
00:33:41,121 --> 00:33:44,180
percentile, right? So it's just
Kevin average human, what's the,

556
00:33:44,181 --> 00:33:47,750
so maybe quick pause and Mars.
A ranking scale.

557
00:33:47,751 --> 00:33:50,830
The matchmaking rating for players.
So it's threes.

558
00:33:51,220 --> 00:33:53,850
I remember there's like a master
and a grand master was 3000.

559
00:33:54,050 --> 00:33:58,370
So 3000 is pretty bad. Um, I
think it's kind of goals level.

560
00:33:58,440 --> 00:34:01,790
It just sounds really good
relative to chess, I think.
Oh yeah, yeah. No, the, the,

561
00:34:01,791 --> 00:34:06,230
the ratings. The best thing though.
Water at 7,000. [inaudible] um, so 3008,

562
00:34:06,460 --> 00:34:07,820
we'd like Eloy. Indeed. Right,

563
00:34:07,821 --> 00:34:12,821
so (300) 030-0500 just allows us to not
feel there are a lot of the data so we

564
00:34:13,671 --> 00:34:16,940
like to have a lot of data and deep
learning as as you probably know,

565
00:34:17,240 --> 00:34:22,240
so we take these kind of 3,500 and above
but then we do a very interesting trick

566
00:34:22,670 --> 00:34:27,670
which is we tell the neural network
what level they are imitating so we say

567
00:34:28,220 --> 00:34:32,510
these replay you are going to try to
imitate to predict the next action for all

568
00:34:32,511 --> 00:34:35,720
the actions that you're going
to see is a 4,000 MMR replay.

569
00:34:36,050 --> 00:34:41,050
These one is a 6,000 MMR we play and
what what's cool about these is then we

570
00:34:41,181 --> 00:34:45,500
take these policy that is being trained
from human and then we can ask it to

571
00:34:45,501 --> 00:34:48,980
play like a 3000 Mr player
by setting a bit saying,

572
00:34:48,981 --> 00:34:53,930
well okay play like a 3000 MMR player
or play like a 6,000 MMR player and you

573
00:34:53,931 --> 00:34:58,880
actually see how the policy behaves
differently. It gets worse. The economy.

574
00:34:58,881 --> 00:35:02,930
If you play like a gold level player,
it does less actions per minute,

575
00:35:02,931 --> 00:35:07,310
which is the number of clicks or number
of actions that you will issue in the

576
00:35:07,310 --> 00:35:09,380
whole minutes and it's very
interesting to see that.

577
00:35:09,410 --> 00:35:12,050
It kind of imitates the
skill level quite well,

578
00:35:12,320 --> 00:35:15,140
but if we ask it to play
like a 6,000 MMR player,

579
00:35:15,440 --> 00:35:18,440
we tested of course these
policies to see how well they do.

580
00:35:18,560 --> 00:35:22,010
They actually beat all the builtin
ais that bleeds or put in the game,

581
00:35:22,340 --> 00:35:24,950
but they're nowhere near
6,000 MMR players. Right?

582
00:35:24,951 --> 00:35:28,430
They might be maybe around
gold level platinum perhaps.

583
00:35:29,200 --> 00:35:33,290
So there's still a lot of work to be
done for the policy to truly understand

584
00:35:33,291 --> 00:35:37,070
what it means to win. So
far we only ask them, okay,

585
00:35:37,080 --> 00:35:41,130
here is the screen and that's what's
happened on the game until this point.

586
00:35:41,580 --> 00:35:46,420
What would the next action be if we ask,
you know, we ask a pro to now say, oh,

587
00:35:46,620 --> 00:35:48,570
you're going to click
here or here or there.

588
00:35:49,080 --> 00:35:52,290
And the point is experiencing,

589
00:35:52,291 --> 00:35:56,490
experiencing wins and losses is very
important to then start to refine a,

590
00:35:56,491 --> 00:36:00,420
otherwise the policy can get loose, can,
can just go off policy as we call it.

591
00:36:00,460 --> 00:36:03,900
That's so interesting that you can at
least hope eventually to be able to

592
00:36:03,901 --> 00:36:06,540
control a policy,
uh,

593
00:36:06,720 --> 00:36:11,400
approximately to be at a some MMR
level as that's so interesting.

594
00:36:11,520 --> 00:36:14,780
Especially given that you have ground
truth for a lot of these cases. Right. Uh,

595
00:36:14,970 --> 00:36:19,650
can I ask you a personal question?
Sure. Uh, what's your MMR? Well,

596
00:36:19,950 --> 00:36:23,670
I haven't played stacker off too,
so I am unranked Oh,

597
00:36:23,680 --> 00:36:27,830
says the kind of lowest league. Okay.
So I used to play starcraft one,

598
00:36:27,920 --> 00:36:32,450
the first one, but you haven't
seriously playing doctor I've talked to.

599
00:36:32,630 --> 00:36:36,840
So the best player we have at
deep mind is about 5,000 MMR.

600
00:36:37,610 --> 00:36:42,040
We gs hi masters is not
at grand master level. Um,

601
00:36:42,070 --> 00:36:46,260
grandmaster level would be the top 200
players in a certain region like Europe

602
00:36:46,261 --> 00:36:49,050
or America or Asia.
Um,

603
00:36:49,110 --> 00:36:52,920
but for me it's would be hard to
say I am very bad at the game.

604
00:36:53,700 --> 00:36:56,640
I actually played Alphas therapy
too late and he'd beat me.

605
00:36:56,641 --> 00:37:00,480
I remember the whole team was, oh,
Oreo, you should play. And I was, oh,

606
00:37:00,481 --> 00:37:03,840
it looks like it's not so good yet.
And then I remember I,

607
00:37:03,841 --> 00:37:08,841
I kind of got busy and waited an extra
week and I played on it really lead me

608
00:37:09,120 --> 00:37:12,830
very badly. I mean, how did that feel? Is
that, isn't that an amazing feeling lens?

609
00:37:12,840 --> 00:37:13,590
Amazing.
Yeah.

610
00:37:13,590 --> 00:37:17,990
I mean obviously I tried my best
and I tried to also impress my,

611
00:37:18,160 --> 00:37:19,770
cause I actually played the first game,

612
00:37:19,771 --> 00:37:23,080
so I'm still pretty good
at micro management. Um,

613
00:37:23,100 --> 00:37:25,180
the brummies I just don't
understand starcraft two.

614
00:37:25,230 --> 00:37:30,230
I understand starcraft and when I played
starcraft I probably was consistently

615
00:37:30,811 --> 00:37:34,630
like for, for a couple of
years, stop 32 in Europe. Um,

616
00:37:34,650 --> 00:37:35,880
so I was decent,

617
00:37:35,881 --> 00:37:40,350
but at the time we didn't have these kind
of MMR system as as well established.

618
00:37:40,351 --> 00:37:42,870
So it will be hard to know
what it was back then.

619
00:37:43,140 --> 00:37:48,010
So what's the difference in the interface
between Alpha Star and starcraft and

620
00:37:48,011 --> 00:37:49,580
the human player and starcraft?

621
00:37:49,620 --> 00:37:53,610
Is there any significant differences
between the way they both see the game?

622
00:37:54,120 --> 00:37:55,950
I would say the way they see the game,

623
00:37:55,980 --> 00:38:00,660
there's a few things that are
just very hard to simulate. Um,

624
00:38:01,020 --> 00:38:05,490
the main one perhaps, which is
all be using hindsight, these,

625
00:38:05,930 --> 00:38:09,870
um, what's called cloaked units,
which are invisible units.

626
00:38:10,530 --> 00:38:11,390
So in,

627
00:38:11,460 --> 00:38:16,460
in starcraft you can make some units that
you need to have a particular kind of,

628
00:38:16,501 --> 00:38:19,990
you need to detectives. So
these unions, I am visible.

629
00:38:20,550 --> 00:38:24,420
If you cannot detect them, you cannot
target them. So they would just, you know,

630
00:38:24,450 --> 00:38:26,910
destroy your buildings
or kill your workers.

631
00:38:27,720 --> 00:38:31,560
But despite the fact you
cannot target the unit,

632
00:38:31,620 --> 00:38:34,830
there's a shimmer that as a
human you observe. I mean,

633
00:38:34,831 --> 00:38:37,030
you need to train a little bit,
do you need to pay attention,

634
00:38:37,390 --> 00:38:42,070
but you would see these kind of spacetime
spacetime like distortion and you

635
00:38:42,071 --> 00:38:46,030
wouldn't know. Okay. There are, yeah.
Yeah. There's like a wave thing.

636
00:38:47,090 --> 00:38:49,060
Shimmers tends to storage.
I don't like it.

637
00:38:49,120 --> 00:38:53,800
That's really like the term is
Shimmer, shimmer. So these Shimmer,

638
00:38:53,890 --> 00:38:57,160
um, professional players
actually can see it immediately.

639
00:38:57,200 --> 00:38:58,780
They understand it very well,

640
00:38:59,470 --> 00:39:03,260
but it's still something that requires
certain amount of attention and, and,

641
00:39:03,270 --> 00:39:07,000
and it's kind of a bit annoying to
deal with. Whereas for Alpha Star,

642
00:39:07,030 --> 00:39:11,790
in terms of vision, it's very hard for us
to simulate sort of all, you know, are,

643
00:39:11,980 --> 00:39:15,290
are you looking at these pixels
in the screen and so on. So, um,

644
00:39:15,310 --> 00:39:19,660
the only thing we can do is we, there
is a unit that's invisible over there.

645
00:39:19,720 --> 00:39:24,010
So Alpha Starwood know that immediately.
Um, obviously still obeys the rules.

646
00:39:24,011 --> 00:39:27,780
You cannot attack the, you need, you
must have a detector and so on. But it's,

647
00:39:27,810 --> 00:39:31,450
it's kind of one of the main things
that he just doesn't feel there's,

648
00:39:31,451 --> 00:39:35,400
there's a very proper way. I
mean, you could imagine, oh,
you, you don't have hypers.

649
00:39:35,470 --> 00:39:37,870
Maybe you don't know exactly where it is,
or sometimes you see it,

650
00:39:37,871 --> 00:39:41,080
sometimes you don't. But
it's, it's just really,

651
00:39:41,081 --> 00:39:44,860
really complicated to get it so that
everyone would agree, oh, that's,

652
00:39:44,950 --> 00:39:47,600
that's the best way to simulate
these. Right. You know,

653
00:39:47,620 --> 00:39:50,890
it seems like a perception problem.
It is a perception problem. So,

654
00:39:50,891 --> 00:39:53,700
so the only problem is people are,

655
00:39:53,770 --> 00:39:56,740
you ask her what's the difference
between how humans perceive the game?

656
00:39:56,741 --> 00:40:01,270
I would say they wouldn't be able to tell
a shimmer immediately as it appears on

657
00:40:01,271 --> 00:40:06,150
the screen. Whereas Alpha
starting principal sees it
very sharply, right? It sees,

658
00:40:06,400 --> 00:40:10,330
it sees that the beat turned from zero to
one, meaning there is now a unit there,

659
00:40:10,480 --> 00:40:13,110
although you don't know the unit
or you don't know, you know,

660
00:40:13,120 --> 00:40:16,720
you know that you cannot attack
it and so on. Um, so that from,

661
00:40:16,721 --> 00:40:18,070
from a vision standpoint,

662
00:40:18,071 --> 00:40:22,630
that probably is the one that
is kind of the most obvious one.

663
00:40:22,930 --> 00:40:26,170
Then there are things humans cannot
do perfectly, even professionals,

664
00:40:26,410 --> 00:40:30,250
which is they might miss a detail
or they might have not seen a unit.

665
00:40:30,610 --> 00:40:32,260
And obviously as a computer,

666
00:40:32,261 --> 00:40:36,460
if there's a corner of the screen that
turns green because a unit enters the

667
00:40:36,461 --> 00:40:39,970
field of view that can go
into the memory of the agent,

668
00:40:39,971 --> 00:40:44,710
the LSTM and proceeds there for a while
and for whatever for however long is

669
00:40:44,711 --> 00:40:47,340
relevant. Right. And
in terms of action, uh,

670
00:40:47,680 --> 00:40:51,620
it seems like the rate of actions
from Alpha stars comparative,

671
00:40:51,621 --> 00:40:56,080
it's not slower than professional players
but is there but it's more precise as

672
00:40:56,081 --> 00:40:57,970
what right. So, so that's, that's very,

673
00:40:58,360 --> 00:41:03,360
that's really probably the one that is
causing us more issues for couple of

674
00:41:04,271 --> 00:41:04,990
reasons.
Right.

675
00:41:04,990 --> 00:41:09,830
The first one is starcraft has been an
AI environment for quite a few years. Um,

676
00:41:09,940 --> 00:41:10,630
in fact,

677
00:41:10,630 --> 00:41:15,630
I mean I was participating in the very
first competition back in 2010 and

678
00:41:17,170 --> 00:41:20,560
there's really not been that kind
of a very clear set of rules,

679
00:41:20,680 --> 00:41:22,150
how the actions per minute,

680
00:41:22,190 --> 00:41:27,190
the rate of actions that you can issue
is and as a result of these agents or

681
00:41:27,701 --> 00:41:31,030
blogs that people build in a
kind of almost very cool way.

682
00:41:31,031 --> 00:41:35,000
They do like 20,000,
40,000 actions per minute.

683
00:41:35,360 --> 00:41:39,050
Now now to put this in perspective,
a very good professional human,

684
00:41:39,470 --> 00:41:43,310
my do 300 to 800 actions per minute.

685
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:47,570
They might not be as precise.
That's why the range is a bit tricky to,

686
00:41:47,620 --> 00:41:48,980
to identify exactly.

687
00:41:48,981 --> 00:41:53,340
I mean 300 actions per minute
precisely is probably realistic. Um,

688
00:41:53,360 --> 00:41:54,560
800 is probably not.

689
00:41:54,561 --> 00:41:58,670
But you see humans doing a lot of actions
because they warm up and they kind of

690
00:41:58,671 --> 00:42:02,150
select things and spam and so on,
just so that when they need,

691
00:42:02,180 --> 00:42:03,800
they have the accuracy.

692
00:42:04,190 --> 00:42:09,190
So we came into this by not having
kind of a standard way to say,

693
00:42:10,041 --> 00:42:14,690
well, how do we measure, um, whether
an agent is at human level or not.

694
00:42:15,830 --> 00:42:18,170
On the other hand,
we had the huge advantage,

695
00:42:18,171 --> 00:42:23,171
which is because we do imitation learning
agents turned out to act like humans

696
00:42:24,441 --> 00:42:25,850
in terms of rate of actions,

697
00:42:25,880 --> 00:42:30,140
even precisions and in precisions
of actions in the supervised policy,

698
00:42:30,141 --> 00:42:31,010
you could see all these,

699
00:42:31,011 --> 00:42:34,700
you could see how agents like
to spam click to move here.

700
00:42:34,701 --> 00:42:37,000
If you played especially the outro,
you wouldn't know what I mean. I mean,

701
00:42:37,040 --> 00:42:40,160
it was just dumb like spam or
movie or Murphy or move here.

702
00:42:40,310 --> 00:42:44,150
You're doing literally like, um,
maybe five actions in two seconds.

703
00:42:44,151 --> 00:42:48,200
But these actions are not bay, meaning
meaningful one would have sufficed.

704
00:42:48,710 --> 00:42:53,540
So on the one hand we start from these
immigration policy that is at the

705
00:42:53,541 --> 00:42:56,480
ballpark of the actions per millions
of humans because it's actually

706
00:42:56,481 --> 00:42:58,640
statistically trying to imitate humans.

707
00:42:58,910 --> 00:43:02,330
So we see these very nicely in the curves
that we showed him, the blog posts,

708
00:43:02,331 --> 00:43:06,790
like there's these actions per minute and
the distribution looks very human like,

709
00:43:07,290 --> 00:43:12,080
um, but then of course as self
play kicks in and that's the buy,

710
00:43:12,081 --> 00:43:13,250
we haven't talked too much yet,

711
00:43:13,251 --> 00:43:16,610
but of course the agent mass
played in itself to improve,

712
00:43:17,180 --> 00:43:21,830
then there's almost no guarantees that
these actions will not become more

713
00:43:21,831 --> 00:43:25,970
precise or even the rate of actions
is going to increase over time. Um,

714
00:43:26,030 --> 00:43:26,960
so what we did,

715
00:43:27,290 --> 00:43:31,190
and this is probably kind of the first
of them that we thought was reasonable,

716
00:43:31,191 --> 00:43:35,630
is we looked at the distribution of
actions for humans for certain windows of

717
00:43:35,631 --> 00:43:37,760
time.
And just to give a perspective,

718
00:43:37,761 --> 00:43:41,630
because I guess I mentioned that some
of these agents that are programmatic,

719
00:43:41,631 --> 00:43:45,710
let's call them, they do 40,000 actions
per minute. Professionals, as I said,

720
00:43:45,711 --> 00:43:47,060
do 300 to 800.

721
00:43:47,360 --> 00:43:51,110
So what we looked at is we look at the
distribution over professional gamers and

722
00:43:51,111 --> 00:43:54,110
we took reasonably high
actions per minute,

723
00:43:54,111 --> 00:43:58,160
but we kind of identify
certain cutoffs after weeds.

724
00:43:58,460 --> 00:44:01,820
Even if the agent wanted to act,
these actions would be dropped.

725
00:44:02,960 --> 00:44:06,720
But the problem is these cutoff
is probably set a bit too high.

726
00:44:07,100 --> 00:44:10,880
And what ends up happening even
though the games and when we as the

727
00:44:10,881 --> 00:44:14,770
professionals and the gamers by by and
large, they feel like it's playing human.

728
00:44:14,771 --> 00:44:18,180
Like, um, there are some
Asians that developed, um,

729
00:44:19,190 --> 00:44:22,390
maybe slightly too high aps,
uh,

730
00:44:22,820 --> 00:44:26,510
which is actions per minute
combined with the position. Um,

731
00:44:26,600 --> 00:44:30,320
which made people sort of start
discussing a very interesting issue,

732
00:44:30,321 --> 00:44:32,400
which is should we limited these,

733
00:44:32,490 --> 00:44:37,350
should we just let it loose and see what
cool things it can come up with? Right.

734
00:44:37,560 --> 00:44:42,030
Interesting. Um, so this is in itself
an extremely interesting question,

735
00:44:42,031 --> 00:44:46,080
but the same way that modeling the
Shimmer will be so difficult modeling.

736
00:44:46,081 --> 00:44:46,741
Absolutely.

737
00:44:46,741 --> 00:44:51,741
All the details about muscles and
precision and tiredness of humans would be

738
00:44:52,021 --> 00:44:56,970
quite difficult. Right? So we really hear
in kind of innovating in the sense of,

739
00:44:57,000 --> 00:44:57,241
okay,

740
00:44:57,241 --> 00:45:02,241
what could be maybe the next iteration
of putting more rules that makes the

741
00:45:02,740 --> 00:45:03,573
agents

742
00:45:03,890 --> 00:45:06,260
more human,
like in terms of restrictions,

743
00:45:06,650 --> 00:45:10,160
putting constraints that more constraints.
Yeah, that's really interesting.

744
00:45:10,161 --> 00:45:14,240
That's really innovative.
So one of the constraints you put on your,

745
00:45:14,300 --> 00:45:15,230
on yourself,

746
00:45:15,410 --> 00:45:19,850
or at least focused in is on the
protests race as far as I understand. Uh,

747
00:45:19,910 --> 00:45:23,750
can you tell me about the
different races and how they, uh,

748
00:45:23,751 --> 00:45:28,190
so protest Taryn and a Zerg, how do
they compare? How do they interact?

749
00:45:28,191 --> 00:45:30,620
Why did you choose protests? Right. Yeah,

750
00:45:30,700 --> 00:45:35,330
it's in the dynamics of the game
scene from a strategic perspective.

751
00:45:35,690 --> 00:45:39,510
So protose um, so in, in stock
or if there are three races, um,

752
00:45:39,710 --> 00:45:43,580
indeed in the demonstration
we saw only the protest race.

753
00:45:43,910 --> 00:45:45,380
So maybe let's start with that.
One.

754
00:45:45,590 --> 00:45:49,330
Practice is kind of the most
technologically advanced race. Um,

755
00:45:49,460 --> 00:45:53,810
it has units that are
expensive but powerful, right?

756
00:45:53,811 --> 00:45:58,670
So in general, you want to kind of
conserve your units, um, as you go attack.

757
00:45:58,671 --> 00:45:59,504
So you want to,

758
00:45:59,620 --> 00:46:04,620
and then you want to utilize
these tactical advantages
of very fancy spells and

759
00:46:05,301 --> 00:46:09,140
so on, so forth. Um, and
at the same time, uh,

760
00:46:09,141 --> 00:46:12,640
there kind of people say like there,

761
00:46:12,660 --> 00:46:16,930
there'll be easier to play perhaps.
Right. But that I actually didn't know.

762
00:46:17,170 --> 00:46:21,880
I mean I just talked to now a lot to
the players that we work with Tlo and

763
00:46:21,881 --> 00:46:24,130
manner and they said, Oh
yeah, protests is actually,

764
00:46:24,131 --> 00:46:28,330
people think is actually one of the
easiest races. So perhaps the easier,

765
00:46:28,331 --> 00:46:33,331
that doesn't mean that it's know
obviously professional players Xcel at the

766
00:46:33,371 --> 00:46:38,371
three races and there's never like a
raise that dominates for debate long time

767
00:46:38,470 --> 00:46:39,030
anyways.

768
00:46:39,030 --> 00:46:41,310
If you look at the top, I don't
know, a hundred in the world,

769
00:46:41,730 --> 00:46:44,100
is there one race that
dominates the lists?

770
00:46:44,340 --> 00:46:48,040
It would be hard to know because it
depends on the regions. I think. Um,

771
00:46:48,460 --> 00:46:52,630
it's pretty equal in terms of distribution
and blizzard once it to be equal.

772
00:46:52,631 --> 00:46:53,411
Right.
They don't want,

773
00:46:53,411 --> 00:46:58,300
they wouldn't want one raise like protest
to not be representative in the top

774
00:46:58,330 --> 00:47:03,040
place. Right. Um, so definitely like
they tried to be like the balance.

775
00:47:03,041 --> 00:47:03,790
Right.

776
00:47:03,790 --> 00:47:08,730
So then maybe the opposite race of
Protos CCIRC Zurich is a raised where you

777
00:47:08,740 --> 00:47:13,740
just kind of expand and take over as
many resources as you can and they have a

778
00:47:14,561 --> 00:47:19,210
very high capacity to regenerate
their units. So if you have an army,

779
00:47:19,270 --> 00:47:23,470
it's not that valuable in terms of losing
the whole army is not a big deal as

780
00:47:23,471 --> 00:47:25,690
Dirk because you can then rebuild it.

781
00:47:25,930 --> 00:47:30,740
And given that you generally
accumulate a huge bank resources, um,

782
00:47:30,820 --> 00:47:33,850
Zurich's typically play by
applying a lot of pressure,

783
00:47:34,180 --> 00:47:38,630
maybe losing the whole army but
then rebuilding it quickly. So, um,

784
00:47:38,680 --> 00:47:42,140
although of course every race,
I mean there's never, um,

785
00:47:42,610 --> 00:47:44,110
I mean they're pretty diverse.
I mean,

786
00:47:44,111 --> 00:47:47,500
there are some units that
are technologically advanced
and they do some very

787
00:47:47,501 --> 00:47:51,460
interesting spells and there's some units
in protests that are less valuable and

788
00:47:51,461 --> 00:47:54,340
you could lose a lot of them and
rebuild them and it wouldn't be a big

789
00:47:54,360 --> 00:47:59,230
deal. All right, so maybe I'm missing out,
maybe I'm going to say some dumb stuff,

790
00:47:59,231 --> 00:48:02,400
but, uh, so summary of strategies.

791
00:48:02,430 --> 00:48:06,490
So first there's collection of a lot of
resources, right? So that's one option.

792
00:48:06,491 --> 00:48:11,360
The other one is explore expanding,
so building other basins.

793
00:48:11,840 --> 00:48:16,760
Then the other is obviously
attack building units and
attacking with those units.

794
00:48:17,240 --> 00:48:20,120
And then, uh, I don't
know what else there is a,

795
00:48:20,600 --> 00:48:23,600
maybe there's the different
timing of attacks,

796
00:48:24,080 --> 00:48:25,760
like do I attack early attack rate?

797
00:48:25,940 --> 00:48:28,910
What are the different strategies that
emerged that you've learned about?

798
00:48:29,060 --> 00:48:33,080
I've read a bunch of people are super
happy that you guys have apparently at

799
00:48:33,081 --> 00:48:36,290
Alpha Pi star apparel is discovered
that it's really good to, uh,

800
00:48:36,320 --> 00:48:41,040
what does it saturate? Oh yeah. Let me
know the line. Yeah, the mineral line is,

801
00:48:41,320 --> 00:48:45,350
yeah. Yeah. And that's a, for
greedy amateur players like myself,

802
00:48:45,560 --> 00:48:47,120
that's always been a good strategy.

803
00:48:47,450 --> 00:48:51,890
You just build up a lot of money and he's
just feels good to just accumulate and

804
00:48:51,891 --> 00:48:56,650
accumulate. Uh, so thank you for
discovering that and validating all of us.

805
00:48:56,651 --> 00:49:01,080
But is there other strategies that you
discovered interesting, a unique to a,

806
00:49:01,100 --> 00:49:02,470
to this game? Yeah. So

807
00:49:03,050 --> 00:49:06,440
if you look at the kind of not
being a starcraft two player,

808
00:49:06,441 --> 00:49:07,460
but of course starcraft,

809
00:49:07,490 --> 00:49:11,760
starcraft two and realtime strategy
games in general are very similar. Um,

810
00:49:12,110 --> 00:49:15,170
I would classify perhaps,
um,

811
00:49:15,360 --> 00:49:18,520
the openings of the game.
They're very important.

812
00:49:18,760 --> 00:49:21,520
And generally I would say
there's two kinds of openings.

813
00:49:21,730 --> 00:49:23,380
One that's standard opening.

814
00:49:23,410 --> 00:49:28,340
That's generally how
players find sort of a,

815
00:49:28,341 --> 00:49:33,341
a balance between risk an economy and
building some units early on so that they

816
00:49:33,861 --> 00:49:36,800
could defend but they're
not to expose basically,

817
00:49:36,801 --> 00:49:39,820
but also expanding quite
quickly. Um, so these,

818
00:49:39,821 --> 00:49:44,090
these would be kind of a standard opening
and within a standard opening then you,

819
00:49:44,091 --> 00:49:48,110
what you do choose generally's what
technology are you aiming towards?

820
00:49:48,350 --> 00:49:49,700
So there's a bit of rock paper,

821
00:49:49,701 --> 00:49:54,701
scissors of you could go for spaceships
or you could go for invisible units or

822
00:49:55,221 --> 00:49:59,270
you could go for either not like massive
units that attack against certain kinds

823
00:49:59,271 --> 00:50:01,310
of units, but they're
weaker hands. Others.

824
00:50:01,610 --> 00:50:06,470
So standard openings themselves
have some choices like rock, paper,

825
00:50:06,471 --> 00:50:07,880
scissors style.
Of course,

826
00:50:07,881 --> 00:50:10,760
if you scout and you're good at
guessing what the opponent is doing,

827
00:50:11,060 --> 00:50:12,770
then you can play in as an advantage.

828
00:50:12,771 --> 00:50:14,450
Because if you know
you're going to play rock,

829
00:50:14,451 --> 00:50:16,010
I mean I'm going to play paper obviously.

830
00:50:16,430 --> 00:50:19,100
So you can imagine that
normal standard games,

831
00:50:19,101 --> 00:50:22,900
Instagram looks like a
continuous rock paper,

832
00:50:22,901 --> 00:50:27,901
scissors game where you guess what the
distribution of rock paper and Caesar is

833
00:50:28,850 --> 00:50:33,850
from the anime and reacting accordingly
to try to beat it or you know,

834
00:50:34,430 --> 00:50:39,020
put the paper out before he kind of
changes his mind from rock to Caesars and

835
00:50:39,021 --> 00:50:42,130
then you would be in a weak position.
So sorry to pause on that. Yeah,

836
00:50:42,140 --> 00:50:44,210
I didn't realize this element
because I know it's true.

837
00:50:44,370 --> 00:50:49,350
Put Poker and I looked at it Broaddus
you're the CEO.

838
00:50:49,430 --> 00:50:53,150
You're also estimating trying to guess
the distributor trying to better but our

839
00:50:53,151 --> 00:50:56,390
estimate the distribution, what the
opponent is likely to be doing. Yeah.

840
00:50:56,450 --> 00:50:57,440
I mean not as a player.

841
00:50:57,441 --> 00:51:02,180
You definitely want to have a belief
state over what's APP on the other side of

842
00:51:02,181 --> 00:51:05,600
the map. Um, and when your
belief state becomes inaccurate,

843
00:51:05,601 --> 00:51:07,700
when you start having that serious doubts,

844
00:51:08,030 --> 00:51:12,350
whether he's going to play something that
you must know, that's when you, Scott,

845
00:51:12,410 --> 00:51:14,480
you want to then gather information,
right?

846
00:51:14,540 --> 00:51:18,650
Is improving the accuracy of the belief
or improving the belief state part of

847
00:51:19,160 --> 00:51:22,760
the loss that you tried to optimize?
Or is it just an a side effect?

848
00:51:22,761 --> 00:51:23,810
It's implicit buttons lists.

849
00:51:24,020 --> 00:51:28,280
You could explicitly model it and it
would be quite good at probably predicting

850
00:51:28,281 --> 00:51:32,740
what's on the other side of the map.
But so far it's all implicit. The law,

851
00:51:32,870 --> 00:51:36,140
there's no, no additional
reward for predicting the enemy.

852
00:51:36,650 --> 00:51:41,240
So there's these standard openings and
then there's what people call it cheese,

853
00:51:41,600 --> 00:51:42,770
which is very interesting.

854
00:51:42,770 --> 00:51:47,540
And Alpha Star sometimes really likes
these kinds of cheese. Um, these cheeses,

855
00:51:47,541 --> 00:51:50,270
what they are is kind
of an online strategy.

856
00:51:51,110 --> 00:51:54,950
You're going to do something sneaky,
you're gonna hide enemies,

857
00:51:55,280 --> 00:51:57,830
hide your own buildings,
close to the enemy base,

858
00:51:58,160 --> 00:52:02,140
or you're going to go for hiding your
technology called buildings so that you do

859
00:52:02,141 --> 00:52:07,141
invisible units and the enemy just cannot
react to the tactic and thus lose the

860
00:52:07,221 --> 00:52:10,780
game. And there's quite a few of
these cheeses and variance of,

861
00:52:10,850 --> 00:52:12,800
of them and they're,

862
00:52:12,801 --> 00:52:16,130
it's where actually the belief
state becomes even more important.

863
00:52:16,340 --> 00:52:20,990
Because if I scout your base and I see
no buildings at all, any human prayer,

864
00:52:20,991 --> 00:52:23,000
know something's up,
they might know,

865
00:52:23,001 --> 00:52:25,460
well you're hiding
something close to my base.

866
00:52:25,610 --> 00:52:28,060
Should I build suddenly a
lot of units to defense?

867
00:52:28,130 --> 00:52:32,440
You'll should I actually block my ramp
with workers so that you cannot come and

868
00:52:32,450 --> 00:52:33,350
destroy my base.

869
00:52:33,470 --> 00:52:38,420
So there's all these is happening and
defending against Jesus is extremely

870
00:52:38,421 --> 00:52:40,760
important.
And in the Alpha Star League,

871
00:52:40,790 --> 00:52:45,050
many agents actually double
up some cheesy strategies.

872
00:52:45,051 --> 00:52:47,660
And in the games we saw
against Tlo and manner,

873
00:52:48,020 --> 00:52:51,770
two out of the 10 agents were actually
doing these kinds of strategies,

874
00:52:51,771 --> 00:52:53,630
which are cheesy strategies.

875
00:52:53,631 --> 00:52:56,690
And then there's a barrier of cheesy
strategy we just called all in.

876
00:52:57,350 --> 00:53:00,590
So an all in strategy is not
perhaps as drastic as, oh,

877
00:53:00,591 --> 00:53:04,310
I'm going to build cannons on your base
and then bring all my workers and try to

878
00:53:04,311 --> 00:53:08,630
just disrupt your base and game over.
Or Gigi, as we say in starcraft,

879
00:53:09,030 --> 00:53:13,640
um, there's these kind of very cool
things that you can align precisely at the

880
00:53:13,641 --> 00:53:15,680
certain time mark.
So for instance,

881
00:53:15,681 --> 00:53:20,320
you can generate exactly 10 unit
composition. That is perfect.

882
00:53:20,321 --> 00:53:24,710
Like five of these type five of these
other type and align the upgrade so that

883
00:53:24,711 --> 00:53:26,220
at four and a half,

884
00:53:26,221 --> 00:53:31,110
let's say you have these 10 units and
the upgrade just finished and at that

885
00:53:31,111 --> 00:53:35,820
point that army is really scary and
unless the enemy really knows what's going

886
00:53:35,821 --> 00:53:37,470
on,
if you push,

887
00:53:38,150 --> 00:53:41,870
you might then have an advantage because
maybe the enemy is doing something more

888
00:53:41,871 --> 00:53:44,000
standard.
It expanded to match it.

889
00:53:44,070 --> 00:53:48,710
It developed too much economy and and
he'd trade off badly against having

890
00:53:48,711 --> 00:53:50,780
defenses and the enemy will lose,

891
00:53:51,080 --> 00:53:54,530
but it's called Arlene because if you
don't win then you're going to lose.

892
00:53:55,000 --> 00:53:58,950
So you see players that do these kinds
of strategies if they don't succeed,

893
00:53:59,160 --> 00:53:59,971
gave me,
is not over.

894
00:53:59,971 --> 00:54:02,520
I mean they still have a base and
they still gathering minerals,

895
00:54:02,820 --> 00:54:06,750
but they will just DJ out of the game
because they know, well game is over.

896
00:54:06,751 --> 00:54:08,520
I gambled and I failed.

897
00:54:08,790 --> 00:54:13,010
So is if we start entering the
game theoretic aspects of the game,

898
00:54:13,310 --> 00:54:15,170
it's really rich and it's really,

899
00:54:15,171 --> 00:54:19,010
that's why it also makes
it quite entertaining to
watch. Even if I don't play,

900
00:54:19,011 --> 00:54:21,020
I still enjoy watching the game.

901
00:54:21,740 --> 00:54:26,210
But the agents are trying to
do these Mosley impressively,

902
00:54:26,870 --> 00:54:30,800
but one element that we improved in self
place creating the Alpha state league

903
00:54:31,370 --> 00:54:34,470
and the Alpha Star League
is not pure self play.

904
00:54:34,650 --> 00:54:39,240
It's trying to create a
different personalities of
agents so that some of them

905
00:54:39,270 --> 00:54:43,590
will become cheese, cheesy agents. Some
of them might become very economical,

906
00:54:43,591 --> 00:54:46,200
very greedy, like getting
all, all the resources,

907
00:54:46,201 --> 00:54:48,720
but then being maybe early
on they going to be weak,

908
00:54:48,810 --> 00:54:50,490
but later on they're
going to be very strong.

909
00:54:51,060 --> 00:54:53,430
And by creating this
personality of agents,

910
00:54:53,431 --> 00:54:57,660
which sometimes it just happens naturally
that you can see kind of an evolution

911
00:54:57,661 --> 00:55:00,800
of agents that given
the previous generation,

912
00:55:00,801 --> 00:55:03,540
they train against all of them and
then they generate kind of the count,

913
00:55:03,541 --> 00:55:07,160
the perfect counter to that
distribution. But these, these agents,

914
00:55:07,460 --> 00:55:11,300
you must have them in the populations
because if you don't have them,

915
00:55:11,301 --> 00:55:14,060
you're not covered against these
things, right? It's kind of you want to,

916
00:55:14,150 --> 00:55:18,830
you want to create all sorts
of the opponents that you
will find in the wild so

917
00:55:18,831 --> 00:55:23,510
you can be exposed to these
cheeses early aggression later,

918
00:55:23,511 --> 00:55:28,340
aggression, more expansions, dropping
units. In your base from the site,

919
00:55:28,370 --> 00:55:33,370
all these things and pure self play
is getting a bit stuck at finding some

920
00:55:34,311 --> 00:55:36,020
subset of these,
but not all of these.

921
00:55:36,110 --> 00:55:41,110
So the Alpha Star League is a way to kind
of do an in of agents that they're all

922
00:55:42,321 --> 00:55:46,190
playing in a league match. Like people
play on Battle Net, right? They play,

923
00:55:46,520 --> 00:55:50,780
you play against someone who does newco
strategy and you immediately, oh my God,

924
00:55:50,781 --> 00:55:52,790
I want to try it,
I want to play again.

925
00:55:53,060 --> 00:55:57,590
And these to me was another critical
part of the, of the, of the problem,

926
00:55:57,591 --> 00:56:01,610
which was can we create a
battle net four agents? Yeah.

927
00:56:01,640 --> 00:56:04,220
That's kind of what the
office star League fascinating

928
00:56:04,230 --> 00:56:08,420
and where they stick to their different
strategies. Yeah. Wow. That's,

929
00:56:08,421 --> 00:56:12,150
that's really, really interesting.
So, but that said, you, uh, uh,

930
00:56:12,151 --> 00:56:16,170
we're fortunate enough or
skilled enough to win five zero.

931
00:56:16,750 --> 00:56:20,700
Uh, and so how hard is it to win? I
mean, that's not the goal. I guess.

932
00:56:20,701 --> 00:56:24,220
I don't know what the goal is.
The goal should be doing majority,

933
00:56:24,640 --> 00:56:27,540
not five zero. But how hard
is it in general to win? Uh,

934
00:56:27,720 --> 00:56:30,910
all matchups I a one one V one.

935
00:56:31,050 --> 00:56:36,050
So that's a very interesting question
because once you see Alpha Star and

936
00:56:37,980 --> 00:56:41,190
superficially you think, well,
okay it one, let's if you,

937
00:56:41,191 --> 00:56:42,970
some of the games like 10 to one,
right,

938
00:56:42,971 --> 00:56:46,770
they'd lost the game that it played with
the camera interface. You might think,

939
00:56:46,771 --> 00:56:49,110
well that's, that's done
right. There's, it's,

940
00:56:49,140 --> 00:56:54,140
it's super human at the game and that's
not really the claim we really can make

941
00:56:54,151 --> 00:56:59,151
actually the claim is we beat a
professional gamer for the first time.

942
00:56:59,800 --> 00:57:04,080
Um, start growth has really been a thing
that has been going on for a few years.

943
00:57:04,081 --> 00:57:08,950
But [inaudible] a moment like this
hasn't not had not occurred before yet,

944
00:57:09,490 --> 00:57:13,420
but are these agents impossible
to beat? Absolutely not. Right?

945
00:57:13,421 --> 00:57:15,510
So that's a bit what's,
you know,

946
00:57:15,730 --> 00:57:19,540
kind of the differences the
agents play at grandmaster level.

947
00:57:19,541 --> 00:57:23,590
They are definitely understand the
game enough to play extremely well. Um,

948
00:57:23,620 --> 00:57:28,300
but are they unbeatable? Do
they play perfect? Um, no,

949
00:57:28,360 --> 00:57:32,680
and actually in starcraft,
because of these sneaky strategies,

950
00:57:33,220 --> 00:57:36,670
it's always possible that you
might take a huge risk sometimes,

951
00:57:36,671 --> 00:57:39,040
but you might get wins right out of these.

952
00:57:39,160 --> 00:57:42,160
So I think that as a domain,

953
00:57:42,620 --> 00:57:44,440
it's still has a lot of opportunities,

954
00:57:44,441 --> 00:57:48,010
not only because of course we want
to learn with less experience.

955
00:57:48,011 --> 00:57:51,280
We would like to, I mean, if I, if I
learned to pray protests, I can play,

956
00:57:51,281 --> 00:57:54,730
turn and learn it much quicker
than Alpha Star Canton. Right?

957
00:57:54,731 --> 00:57:58,300
So there are obvious interesting
research challenges as well,

958
00:57:58,690 --> 00:58:03,190
but even as, as the raw, as
the raw performance goes, um,

959
00:58:03,310 --> 00:58:06,600
really the claim here can be,
we are at the pro level or at,

960
00:58:06,601 --> 00:58:11,180
at grant high grandmaster
level. Um, but obviously, um,

961
00:58:11,200 --> 00:58:14,470
the players also did not
know what to expect, right?

962
00:58:14,471 --> 00:58:18,190
These kind of their prior distribution
was a bit off because they played this

963
00:58:18,191 --> 00:58:21,790
kind of new like alien brain
as they like to say drive.

964
00:58:22,060 --> 00:58:25,660
And that's what makes it
exciting for them. But also,

965
00:58:25,900 --> 00:58:28,030
I think if you look at the games closely,

966
00:58:28,031 --> 00:58:30,910
you see there were
weaknesses in some points.

967
00:58:31,510 --> 00:58:36,070
Maybe Alpha start did not scout or if it
had had invisible units going against,

968
00:58:36,071 --> 00:58:39,250
at certain points it wouldn't have
known and it would have been bad.

969
00:58:39,550 --> 00:58:44,100
So there's still quite a lot of work
to do. Um, but it's really a very,

970
00:58:44,101 --> 00:58:47,050
very exciting moment for us to be seeing.
Wow.

971
00:58:47,170 --> 00:58:51,400
A single neural net on a GPU is actually
playing against these guys who are

972
00:58:51,460 --> 00:58:54,250
amazing. I mean, you have to see
them play in life. They're really,

973
00:58:54,251 --> 00:58:55,510
really amazing players.

974
00:58:55,770 --> 00:58:57,450
Yeah, I'm sure there's,
there's a, there must,

975
00:58:57,510 --> 00:59:02,510
there must be a guy in Poland somewhere
right now training his butt off to make

976
00:59:03,121 --> 00:59:05,790
sure that this never happens
again with Alpha star.

977
00:59:06,600 --> 00:59:11,290
So that's really exciting in terms of
Alpha star having some holes to exploit,

978
00:59:11,580 --> 00:59:12,191
which is great.

979
00:59:12,191 --> 00:59:16,750
And then you build on top of each other
and it feels like starcraft, unlike go,

980
00:59:17,020 --> 00:59:21,770
even if you win, it's still
not there. Still not there.

981
00:59:21,771 --> 00:59:22,040
So

982
00:59:22,040 --> 00:59:24,800
many different dimensions in which
you can explore. So that's really,

983
00:59:24,801 --> 00:59:28,460
really interesting. Do you think
there's a ceiling to Alpha Star?

984
00:59:28,630 --> 00:59:33,290
You've said that it hasn't reached, you
know, it's, this is a big, like what,

985
00:59:33,920 --> 00:59:37,820
let me actually just pause for a second.
How did it feel to,

986
00:59:37,821 --> 00:59:40,430
to come here to this point to,

987
00:59:40,431 --> 00:59:44,570
to beat a top professional player
like that night? I mean, you know,

988
00:59:44,571 --> 00:59:49,190
Olympic athletes have their
gold medal, right? This is
your gold medal sense. Sure.

989
00:59:49,191 --> 00:59:53,090
You're cited a lot. You've published
a lot of procedures, papers, whatever.

990
00:59:53,091 --> 00:59:56,040
But this is like a win.
Uh, how did it feel?

991
00:59:56,470 --> 00:59:59,250
I mean it was, for me
it was unbelievable. Um,

992
00:59:59,410 --> 01:00:04,090
because first the,
we need south me,

993
01:00:04,120 --> 01:00:05,460
it was so exciting.
I mean the,

994
01:00:05,600 --> 01:00:10,600
so looking back to those last
days of 2018 really well,

995
01:00:11,020 --> 01:00:14,980
that's when the games were played. Um,
I'm sure I, I look back at that moment,

996
01:00:14,981 --> 01:00:17,980
I say, oh my God, I want to be
like in a project like that,

997
01:00:17,981 --> 01:00:21,300
it's like I already feel
the nostalgia of like, yeah,

998
01:00:21,301 --> 01:00:26,010
that was huge in terms of the energy
and the team effort that went into it.

999
01:00:26,280 --> 01:00:30,900
And so in that sense, as soon as it
happened, I already knew it was kind of,

1000
01:00:31,260 --> 01:00:32,880
I was losing it a little bit.

1001
01:00:32,940 --> 01:00:37,590
So it is almost like sad that it happened
and oh my God. But on the other hand,

1002
01:00:38,300 --> 01:00:42,440
it also verifies the
approach. Um, but to me also,

1003
01:00:42,441 --> 01:00:46,700
there's so many challenges and interesting
aspects of intelligence that even

1004
01:00:46,701 --> 01:00:51,701
though we can train a neural network to
play at the level of the best humans,

1005
01:00:52,330 --> 01:00:55,640
um, there's still so many challenges.
So for me it's also like, well,

1006
01:00:55,641 --> 01:00:57,410
this is really an amazing achievement,

1007
01:00:57,411 --> 01:01:00,740
but I already was also thinking
about next steps. I mean, as I said,

1008
01:01:01,010 --> 01:01:03,950
these Asians play protest versus protos.
Um,

1009
01:01:04,010 --> 01:01:08,120
but they should be able to play a
different race much quicker, right?

1010
01:01:08,121 --> 01:01:10,600
So that would be an amazing achievement.

1011
01:01:10,610 --> 01:01:14,510
Some people call these metal reinforcement
learning, metal learning and so on,

1012
01:01:14,511 --> 01:01:18,920
right? So there's so many
possibilities after that moment,

1013
01:01:18,921 --> 01:01:23,480
but the moment he'd solve it
really felt great. Um, it's, I,

1014
01:01:23,540 --> 01:01:27,680
we had these bets, so, so I, I'm
kind of a pessimistic in general,

1015
01:01:27,681 --> 01:01:30,440
so I kind of send an email
to the team. I said, okay,

1016
01:01:31,300 --> 01:01:35,090
let's against deal offers, right?
Like what's going to be the result?

1017
01:01:35,091 --> 01:01:39,520
And I really thought we would lose
like five zero. Right? Aye. I,

1018
01:01:39,880 --> 01:01:43,780
we had some calibration made
against the 5,000 MMR player. Um,

1019
01:01:44,000 --> 01:01:48,790
Dlo was much stronger than that player.
Even if he played protests,

1020
01:01:48,810 --> 01:01:53,040
which is his off race. Um, but yeah,
it was not imagined we would wait.

1021
01:01:53,050 --> 01:01:55,540
So for me that was just kind
of a test run or something.

1022
01:01:55,541 --> 01:01:57,320
And then it really kind of,

1023
01:01:57,321 --> 01:02:01,660
he was really surprised and unbelievably,
we went to these,

1024
01:02:02,320 --> 01:02:06,620
to these bar to celebrate and,
and Dave thousand me, well wait,

1025
01:02:06,670 --> 01:02:10,940
why don't we invite someone who is
a thousand MMR stronger in protests,

1026
01:02:10,941 --> 01:02:15,610
like an actual protest player like
that. He ended up being manner. Right.

1027
01:02:16,150 --> 01:02:19,980
And you know, we had some drinks and I
said, sure, why not? But then I thought,

1028
01:02:19,981 --> 01:02:22,050
well that's really going
to be impossible to beat.

1029
01:02:22,051 --> 01:02:24,300
I mean even because it is so much,

1030
01:02:24,301 --> 01:02:29,220
I had a thousand MMR is really
like 99% probability that Manna,

1031
01:02:29,221 --> 01:02:32,640
we'd beat Tlo as protest versus protests.
Right.

1032
01:02:33,000 --> 01:02:35,190
So we did that and to me the second,

1033
01:02:35,191 --> 01:02:38,980
the second game was much more important.

1034
01:02:38,980 --> 01:02:42,380
Even though a lot of uncertainty
kind of disappeared after,

1035
01:02:42,381 --> 01:02:45,620
we cannot beat the yellow.
I mean he's a professional player,

1036
01:02:45,621 --> 01:02:50,180
so that was kind of over. That's really
a very nice achievement. But man,

1037
01:02:50,181 --> 01:02:53,750
I really was at the top and you
could see he played much better,

1038
01:02:53,810 --> 01:02:56,460
but our agents got much better too.
So it's a,

1039
01:02:57,380 --> 01:03:00,860
and then after the first game, I
said, if we take a single game,

1040
01:03:00,861 --> 01:03:04,310
at least we can say we beat a game. I
mean, even if we don't meet the serious,

1041
01:03:04,311 --> 01:03:09,150
for me that was a huge relief and I
mean, I remembered it. Hacking them is,

1042
01:03:09,151 --> 01:03:09,841
and immediate was,

1043
01:03:09,841 --> 01:03:13,950
it was really like these moment for me
will resonate forever as a researcher.

1044
01:03:14,160 --> 01:03:15,810
And I mean, as a person and a, yeah,

1045
01:03:15,811 --> 01:03:20,610
it's a really great accomplishment and
it was great also to be there with the

1046
01:03:20,611 --> 01:03:24,930
team in the room. I don't know if you
saw like, so it was really like, I mean,

1047
01:03:24,931 --> 01:03:25,764
from my perspective,

1048
01:03:25,920 --> 01:03:29,610
the other interesting thing is
just like watching Kasparov, uh,

1049
01:03:29,820 --> 01:03:34,240
watching Mana, uh, was also
interesting because he didn't,

1050
01:03:34,241 --> 01:03:37,300
his kind of a a loss of words.
I mean, whenever you lose,

1051
01:03:37,301 --> 01:03:40,630
I've done a lot of sports.
You sometimes say excuses,

1052
01:03:41,200 --> 01:03:45,940
you look for reasons, right.
And he couldn't really
come up with reasons. Yeah.

1053
01:03:46,210 --> 01:03:50,890
I mean, uh, uh, so with the offerings
for protests, you could say it was,

1054
01:03:51,130 --> 01:03:54,190
it felt awkward. It wasn't,
but here it was. Yeah, it was,

1055
01:03:54,340 --> 01:03:58,150
it was just beaten and it was beautiful
to look at a human being being

1056
01:03:58,151 --> 01:04:03,000
superseded by an AI system. And, um,
it's a, it's a beautiful moment for,

1057
01:04:03,001 --> 01:04:04,240
for researchers.
So

1058
01:04:04,380 --> 01:04:09,090
yeah, for sure. It was, it
was, I mean, probably the
highlight of my career so far,

1059
01:04:09,330 --> 01:04:12,480
um, because of its uniqueness
and coolness and I don't know,

1060
01:04:12,510 --> 01:04:16,200
I mean it's obviously, as you said, you
can look at papers, citations and so on,

1061
01:04:16,201 --> 01:04:17,034
but these,

1062
01:04:17,520 --> 01:04:22,350
these really is like a testament of the
whole machine learning approach, um,

1063
01:04:22,380 --> 01:04:26,340
and using games to advance technology.
I mean, it's really, it really was.

1064
01:04:26,820 --> 01:04:29,730
Everything came together at that
moment that that's really the summary.

1065
01:04:29,810 --> 01:04:31,250
Also on the other side,

1066
01:04:31,280 --> 01:04:36,280
it's a popularization of AI too
because it's just like traveling to a,

1067
01:04:36,590 --> 01:04:38,480
to the moon and so on.
I mean,

1068
01:04:38,481 --> 01:04:43,020
this is where a very large community
of people that don't really know AI,

1069
01:04:43,120 --> 01:04:45,980
they get to really interact with it.
Very important.

1070
01:04:46,900 --> 01:04:50,760
We must, um, you know, writing
papers, hubs, our peers,

1071
01:04:50,790 --> 01:04:52,530
researchers to understand
what we're doing.

1072
01:04:52,531 --> 01:04:57,531
But I think AI is becoming mature enough
that we must sort of try to explain

1073
01:04:58,471 --> 01:05:00,740
what it is and perhaps through games is,
is a,

1074
01:05:00,760 --> 01:05:03,600
an abusive way because these
games always had built in AI.

1075
01:05:03,601 --> 01:05:08,340
So it may be everyone experience an AI
playing a video game even if they don't

1076
01:05:08,341 --> 01:05:08,521
know,

1077
01:05:08,521 --> 01:05:11,820
because there's always some scripted
element and some people might even call

1078
01:05:11,821 --> 01:05:12,900
that AI already.
Right.

1079
01:05:13,540 --> 01:05:16,860
Uh,
so what are other applications of a,

1080
01:05:16,940 --> 01:05:20,260
the approaches underlying Alpha
Star that you see happening?

1081
01:05:20,290 --> 01:05:24,970
There's a lot of echoes of, he said,
transformer of language modeling. So on,

1082
01:05:25,630 --> 01:05:30,610
have you already started thinking where
the breakthroughs in Alpha star get

1083
01:05:30,611 --> 01:05:32,110
expanded to other applications?

1084
01:05:32,270 --> 01:05:36,380
Right. So I thought that about a few
things for like kind of next month's,

1085
01:05:36,381 --> 01:05:38,030
next years.
Um,

1086
01:05:38,440 --> 01:05:41,920
the main thing I'm thinking about
actually is what's next as a,

1087
01:05:41,921 --> 01:05:44,380
as a kind of a grand challenge because um,

1088
01:05:44,410 --> 01:05:48,340
for me like we've seen a tardy
and then there's like the,

1089
01:05:48,380 --> 01:05:51,910
the sort of three dimensional walls
that we've seen also like pretty good

1090
01:05:51,911 --> 01:05:55,930
performance from these capture the flag
agents that also some people at the mine

1091
01:05:55,931 --> 01:05:57,280
and elsewhere are working on.

1092
01:05:57,580 --> 01:06:00,070
We've also seen some amazing
results on like for instance,

1093
01:06:00,071 --> 01:06:04,660
Dota two which is also a very
complicated game. So for me,

1094
01:06:04,661 --> 01:06:07,930
like the main thing I'm thinking about
is what's next in terms of challenge.

1095
01:06:07,960 --> 01:06:12,960
So as a researcher I see sort of two
tensions between research and then

1096
01:06:15,430 --> 01:06:18,220
applications or areas or
domains where you apply them.

1097
01:06:18,430 --> 01:06:22,410
So on the one hand we've done thanks
to the application of starcraft,

1098
01:06:22,411 --> 01:06:24,460
he's very hard.
We develop some techniques,

1099
01:06:24,461 --> 01:06:27,430
some new research that now
we could look at elsewhere.

1100
01:06:27,460 --> 01:06:31,720
Like are there other applications where
we can apply this? And the obvious ones,

1101
01:06:31,721 --> 01:06:35,010
absolutely you can think of.
Um,

1102
01:06:35,160 --> 01:06:38,100
feeding back to sort of
the community we took from,

1103
01:06:38,101 --> 01:06:41,660
which was mostly sequenced modeling
or natural language processing.

1104
01:06:41,661 --> 01:06:46,661
So we've developed or an extended things
from the transformer and we use pointer

1105
01:06:47,570 --> 01:06:50,780
networks. We combine LSTM and
transformers in interesting ways.

1106
01:06:51,260 --> 01:06:56,180
So that's perhaps the kind of lowest
hanging fruit of feeding back to now.

1107
01:06:56,210 --> 01:07:00,320
Um, different fields of machine
learning that's not playing video games.

1108
01:07:00,890 --> 01:07:05,520
Let me go old school and jump to
the, to Mr Alan Turing. Yeah. Uh,

1109
01:07:05,650 --> 01:07:08,340
so the touring test,
no,

1110
01:07:08,410 --> 01:07:11,050
it says in natural language
test to compensational tests.

1111
01:07:11,530 --> 01:07:15,560
What's your thought of it as
a test for intelligence? Uh,

1112
01:07:15,710 --> 01:07:18,880
do you think it is a grand challenge
that's worthy of undertaking?

1113
01:07:18,881 --> 01:07:23,320
Maybe if it is, would you reformulate
it or phrase it somehow differently?

1114
01:07:23,650 --> 01:07:24,281
Right.
So I,

1115
01:07:24,281 --> 01:07:28,210
I really love the touring test because
I also like sequences and language

1116
01:07:28,211 --> 01:07:29,044
understanding.

1117
01:07:29,530 --> 01:07:33,490
And in fact some of the early work
we did in machine translation,

1118
01:07:33,491 --> 01:07:37,180
we tried to apply to apply to
kind of a neuro chat bot. Um,

1119
01:07:37,240 --> 01:07:41,500
which obviously would never pass the
Turing test because it was very limited.

1120
01:07:42,280 --> 01:07:44,140
But it is a very fascinating,

1121
01:07:44,170 --> 01:07:49,170
fascinating idea that you could
really have an AI that would be

1122
01:07:50,201 --> 01:07:55,201
indistinguishable from humans in terms
of asking or convert conversing with with

1123
01:07:55,591 --> 01:07:55,981
it.
Right.

1124
01:07:55,981 --> 01:08:00,981
So I think the test itself seems very
nice and it's kind of well defined

1125
01:08:02,161 --> 01:08:04,620
actually like the,
the passing it or not.

1126
01:08:04,950 --> 01:08:09,630
I think there's quite a few rules
that feel like pretty simple and, and,

1127
01:08:09,631 --> 01:08:12,330
and you know, you could,
you could really like have,

1128
01:08:12,460 --> 01:08:16,040
I mean I think they have
these competitions every year,
so the Lug nut prize, but

1129
01:08:16,040 --> 01:08:20,900
I don't know if you've seen, eh, I
don't know if you've seen the kind of,

1130
01:08:20,901 --> 01:08:23,840
uh,
bots that emerge from that competition.

1131
01:08:24,140 --> 01:08:27,950
They're not quite as,
um, what you would, uh,

1132
01:08:28,250 --> 01:08:31,190
it feels like that there's weaknesses
with the way touring formulated.

1133
01:08:31,191 --> 01:08:33,490
It needs to be,
uh,

1134
01:08:33,960 --> 01:08:37,430
that the definition of a genuine rich,

1135
01:08:37,431 --> 01:08:41,600
fulfilling human conversation
and needs to be something else.

1136
01:08:41,601 --> 01:08:44,480
Like the Alexa Prize,
which I'm not as well familiar with,

1137
01:08:44,810 --> 01:08:46,130
has tried to define that more,

1138
01:08:46,131 --> 01:08:50,240
I think by saying you have to continue
keeping a conversation for 30 minutes,

1139
01:08:50,600 --> 01:08:55,460
something like that. Uh, so basically
forcing the agent not to just fool,

1140
01:08:55,461 --> 01:08:59,180
but to have an engaging conversation
kind of thing. Is that, um,

1141
01:09:00,010 --> 01:09:02,230
I mean,
is this,

1142
01:09:02,260 --> 01:09:07,030
have you thought about this
problem richly? Like has, and if,

1143
01:09:07,190 --> 01:09:10,480
if you have in general, how,
how far away are we from?

1144
01:09:10,640 --> 01:09:15,370
You worked a lot on language, uh,
understanding language generation,

1145
01:09:15,400 --> 01:09:19,860
but the full dialogue, the conversation.
Yeah. You know, just sitting at the bar,

1146
01:09:19,861 --> 01:09:22,860
having a couple of beers for an hour,
that kind of conversation.

1147
01:09:22,890 --> 01:09:23,580
Have you thought about,

1148
01:09:23,580 --> 01:09:28,330
yeah. So I think you'd touched here on
the critical point, which is feasibility,

1149
01:09:28,331 --> 01:09:32,440
right? So, so there's, there's a
great sort of essay by humming,

1150
01:09:32,830 --> 01:09:37,830
which describes sort of grand challenges
of physics and he argues that,

1151
01:09:39,190 --> 01:09:40,720
well, okay, for instance,

1152
01:09:41,050 --> 01:09:45,220
teleportation or time travel are
great grand challenges of physics,

1153
01:09:45,221 --> 01:09:50,170
but there's no attacks we really don't
know or cannot kind of make any progress.

1154
01:09:50,260 --> 01:09:53,320
So that's why most physicists and so on,

1155
01:09:53,321 --> 01:09:57,310
they don't work on these in their PhDs
and, and as part of their careers.

1156
01:09:57,850 --> 01:10:02,710
So I see the Turing test as I in the food
Turing test as a bit still too early.

1157
01:10:02,711 --> 01:10:04,810
Like I am.
I think we're,

1158
01:10:05,170 --> 01:10:09,640
especially with the current trend
of deep learning language models,

1159
01:10:10,030 --> 01:10:14,110
we've seen some amazing examples,
I think gpt to being the most recent one,

1160
01:10:14,111 --> 01:10:18,130
which is very impressive. But
to understand, to fully solve

1161
01:10:19,120 --> 01:10:22,030
passing or fooling a human,
to think that you're,

1162
01:10:22,040 --> 01:10:25,630
that there's a human on the other side.
I think we're quite far. So as a result,

1163
01:10:25,631 --> 01:10:30,610
I don't see myself and I probably would
not recommend people doing a phd on

1164
01:10:30,611 --> 01:10:34,720
solving the Turing test because it just
feels it's kind of too early or too hard

1165
01:10:34,721 --> 01:10:38,790
of a problem. Yeah. But that said, you
said the exact same thing about starcraft,

1166
01:10:38,980 --> 01:10:43,570
but a few years ago, so in the
two demos, so a, I agree. Yeah.

1167
01:10:43,630 --> 01:10:47,890
You'll probably also be the person who
passes the Turing test in three years.

1168
01:10:48,190 --> 01:10:52,630
I mean, I think, I think that, yeah, so,
so we have the sun record. This is nice.

1169
01:10:52,660 --> 01:10:56,110
It's true. It's true. I mean the,
the, it's through that progress.

1170
01:10:56,111 --> 01:10:57,790
Sometimes it's a bit unpredictable.

1171
01:10:57,791 --> 01:11:00,790
I really wouldn't have
not I even six months ago,

1172
01:11:00,791 --> 01:11:04,750
I would not have predicted the level that
we see that these agents can deliver,

1173
01:11:05,030 --> 01:11:08,300
um, at the grand master level. But I,

1174
01:11:08,301 --> 01:11:13,090
I have worked on language enough and
basically my concern is not that something

1175
01:11:13,260 --> 01:11:13,591
happen,

1176
01:11:13,591 --> 01:11:17,640
a breakthrough could happen that would
bring us to sobbing or passing the Turing

1177
01:11:17,641 --> 01:11:22,140
test is that I just think the
statistical approach to it like this,

1178
01:11:22,390 --> 01:11:25,710
he is not, is not going to cut it. So
we, we need, we need to break through,

1179
01:11:25,920 --> 01:11:29,390
which is great for the
community. Um, but given that I,

1180
01:11:29,600 --> 01:11:33,480
I think there's quite a more uncertainty,
whereas for starcraft,

1181
01:11:34,210 --> 01:11:38,080
I knew what the steps would
be to kind of get us there.

1182
01:11:38,081 --> 01:11:42,640
I think it was clear that
using the mutation learning
part and then using these

1183
01:11:42,790 --> 01:11:45,400
battlenet for agents,
we're going to be key.

1184
01:11:45,580 --> 01:11:49,890
And it turned out that this was the
case and a little more was needed,

1185
01:11:49,891 --> 01:11:52,470
but not much more for touring test.

1186
01:11:52,471 --> 01:11:55,920
I just don't know what the plan
or execution plan would look like.

1187
01:11:55,921 --> 01:11:59,470
So that's why I'm,
I myself working on it as a,

1188
01:11:59,471 --> 01:12:01,210
as a grand challenge is hard.

1189
01:12:01,450 --> 01:12:05,470
But there are quite a few sub challenges
that are related that you could see.

1190
01:12:05,471 --> 01:12:05,951
Well,
I mean,

1191
01:12:05,951 --> 01:12:10,951
what if you create a great assistant
like Google already has like the Google

1192
01:12:11,380 --> 01:12:14,650
Assistant. So can we make it better
and can we make it fully new role?

1193
01:12:14,651 --> 01:12:18,820
And so on that I start to believe maybe
we're reaching a point where we should

1194
01:12:18,821 --> 01:12:20,410
attempt these challenges.

1195
01:12:20,670 --> 01:12:23,850
I like La like this conversation so much
because it echoes very much to start

1196
01:12:23,860 --> 01:12:26,830
our conversation.
It's exactly how you approach starcraft.

1197
01:12:26,860 --> 01:12:30,580
Let's break it down into small pieces and
solve those and you end up solving the

1198
01:12:30,581 --> 01:12:33,230
whole game. Great. But that said, you,

1199
01:12:33,231 --> 01:12:38,110
you're behind some of the sort of biggest
pieces of work and deep learning in

1200
01:12:38,111 --> 01:12:42,210
the last several years.
So you mentioned some limits.

1201
01:12:42,300 --> 01:12:46,050
What do you think of the current limits
of deep learning and how do we overcome

1202
01:12:46,051 --> 01:12:46,884
those limits?

1203
01:12:47,060 --> 01:12:52,060
So if I had to actually use a single wart
to defined the main challenge in deep

1204
01:12:52,841 --> 01:12:56,710
learning is a challenge. That probably
has been the chance for many years.

1205
01:12:57,010 --> 01:12:58,900
And he's that of generalization.

1206
01:12:59,710 --> 01:13:03,460
So what that means is that okay,

1207
01:13:03,580 --> 01:13:06,340
all that we're doing is
feeding functions to data.

1208
01:13:06,760 --> 01:13:09,880
And when the data we see ease,

1209
01:13:10,210 --> 01:13:14,890
not from the same distribution or even
if they're sometimes that it is very

1210
01:13:14,891 --> 01:13:16,120
close to the distribution,

1211
01:13:16,780 --> 01:13:20,010
but because of the way we train
it with limited samples, um,

1212
01:13:20,220 --> 01:13:25,220
we then get to these states where we just
don't see generalization as much as we

1213
01:13:26,870 --> 01:13:31,220
can generalize. And I think adversarial
examples are a clear example of these.

1214
01:13:31,221 --> 01:13:35,410
But if you study machine learning
and literature and you know, the,

1215
01:13:35,430 --> 01:13:40,010
the reason why svms came very popular
where because they were dealing and they

1216
01:13:40,011 --> 01:13:42,380
had some guarantees about generalization,

1217
01:13:42,381 --> 01:13:47,150
which is unseen data or
out of distribution or even
within distribution where

1218
01:13:47,151 --> 01:13:51,080
you take an image of adding a
bit of noise, these models fail.

1219
01:13:51,230 --> 01:13:53,950
So I think really,

1220
01:13:54,740 --> 01:13:57,810
I don't see a lot of progress
on generalization in,

1221
01:13:57,811 --> 01:14:01,400
in the strong generalization
sense of the word.

1222
01:14:01,850 --> 01:14:05,180
I think our newer neural networks,

1223
01:14:05,270 --> 01:14:10,270
you can always find design examples
that will make their outputs arbitrary,

1224
01:14:11,020 --> 01:14:11,950
which is,
which,

1225
01:14:12,010 --> 01:14:17,010
which is not good because we humans will
never be fooled by these kind of images

1226
01:14:17,831 --> 01:14:21,730
or manipulation of the image.
And if you look at the mathematics,

1227
01:14:21,731 --> 01:14:26,000
you kind of understand this is a bunch
of matrices multiplied together. Um,

1228
01:14:26,050 --> 01:14:30,460
there's probably numerics and instability
that you can just find corner cases.

1229
01:14:30,790 --> 01:14:35,790
So I think that's really the underlying
topic many times we see when,

1230
01:14:36,480 --> 01:14:40,810
um, even even at the grand stage of
like during tests generalization,

1231
01:14:40,811 --> 01:14:44,890
I mean you've used, if you start
passing the Turing test, should you,

1232
01:14:44,950 --> 01:14:49,330
should it be in English or should it be in
any language? Right? I mean, as a human,

1233
01:14:49,331 --> 01:14:53,170
if you could, you could, if you ask
something in a different language,

1234
01:14:53,171 --> 01:14:56,800
you actually will go and do some research
and try to translate it and so on.

1235
01:14:57,670 --> 01:15:00,790
Should the Turing test
include, include that? Right.

1236
01:15:01,030 --> 01:15:04,840
And it's really a difficult problem and
very fascinating and very mysterious

1237
01:15:04,841 --> 01:15:08,890
actually. Yeah, absolutely.
But do you think it's, if
you were to try to solve it,

1238
01:15:10,510 --> 01:15:15,510
can you not grow the size of data
intelligently in such a way that the

1239
01:15:15,761 --> 01:15:19,750
distribution of your training set does
include the entirety of the testing set?

1240
01:15:20,320 --> 01:15:23,800
I think is that one path. The other
path is totally new methodologies,

1241
01:15:23,930 --> 01:15:24,910
not statistical.

1242
01:15:24,940 --> 01:15:28,960
So a path that has worked well and it
worked well even in starcraft and in

1243
01:15:28,961 --> 01:15:32,770
machine translation and in languages
scaling up the data and the model.

1244
01:15:32,771 --> 01:15:37,771
And that's kind of been maybe the only
single formula that the leap still

1245
01:15:38,711 --> 01:15:40,630
delivers today in deep
learning, right? It's,

1246
01:15:40,690 --> 01:15:45,690
it's that scale data scale and mother's
care really do more and more of the

1247
01:15:46,031 --> 01:15:47,380
things that we thought,
oh,

1248
01:15:47,381 --> 01:15:50,530
there's no way it can generalize to these
or if there's no way it can generalize

1249
01:15:50,531 --> 01:15:54,490
to that, but I don't think fundamentally
it will be solved with this.

1250
01:15:54,790 --> 01:15:57,730
And for instance, I'm really liking, um,

1251
01:15:58,210 --> 01:16:02,470
some style or approach that would not
only have neural networks but it would

1252
01:16:02,471 --> 01:16:07,471
have programs or some discrete decision
making because there is where I feel

1253
01:16:07,930 --> 01:16:09,960
there's a bit more like,

1254
01:16:10,020 --> 01:16:13,750
like I mean the example of the best
example I think for understanding disease.

1255
01:16:14,300 --> 01:16:14,650
Um,

1256
01:16:14,650 --> 01:16:18,550
I also work to be done or like we can
learn an algorithm with a neural network,

1257
01:16:18,551 --> 01:16:18,791
right?

1258
01:16:18,791 --> 01:16:22,360
So you're given many examples and needs
is going to sort your sort of the input

1259
01:16:22,361 --> 01:16:23,770
numbers or something like that.

1260
01:16:24,400 --> 01:16:29,400
But really strong generalization is you
give me some numbers or you asked me to

1261
01:16:30,550 --> 01:16:33,730
create an algorithm that sorts numbers
and instead of creating a neural net,

1262
01:16:33,731 --> 01:16:36,970
which will be fragile because
it's going to go out of range,

1263
01:16:37,330 --> 01:16:40,330
at some point you're going to give
you the numbers that are too large,

1264
01:16:40,331 --> 01:16:42,640
too small and whatnot.
You just,

1265
01:16:42,641 --> 01:16:46,360
if you just create a piece of
code that sorts the numbers,

1266
01:16:46,361 --> 01:16:50,590
then you can prove that that will
generalize to absolutely all the possible

1267
01:16:50,591 --> 01:16:51,430
input you could give.

1268
01:16:51,940 --> 01:16:55,900
So I think that's the problem
comes with some exciting prospects.

1269
01:16:55,901 --> 01:16:59,230
I mean scale is a bit more boring,
but it really works.

1270
01:16:59,500 --> 01:17:04,500
And then maybe programs and discrete
abstractions are a bit less developed.

1271
01:17:04,841 --> 01:17:09,800
But clearly I think they're
quite exciting. In terms
of future for the field,

1272
01:17:09,930 --> 01:17:12,090
do you draw any insight,

1273
01:17:12,091 --> 01:17:16,740
wisdom from the 80s and expert systems
and symbolic systems of all competing?

1274
01:17:16,920 --> 01:17:20,730
Do you ever go back to those sort
of reasoning, that kind of logic?

1275
01:17:20,760 --> 01:17:24,720
Do you think that might make a comeback?
You'll have to dust off those books?

1276
01:17:24,900 --> 01:17:25,171
Yeah,

1277
01:17:25,171 --> 01:17:30,060
I actually love actually I
think more inductive biases.

1278
01:17:30,420 --> 01:17:34,050
Um, the problem really is
what are you trying to solve?

1279
01:17:34,290 --> 01:17:38,430
If what you're trying to solve is so
important that tried to solve it no matter

1280
01:17:38,431 --> 01:17:42,270
what,
then absolutely use rules,

1281
01:17:42,480 --> 01:17:47,070
use domain knowledge and then use a
bit of the magic of machine learning to

1282
01:17:47,071 --> 01:17:52,071
empower to make the system as the best
system that will detect cancer or,

1283
01:17:52,151 --> 01:17:55,530
or, um, you know, or, or the
tech weather patterns. Right.

1284
01:17:56,010 --> 01:17:59,130
Or in terms of stock graphics
also was a very big challenge.

1285
01:17:59,131 --> 01:18:04,131
So I was definitely happy that if we had
to get take catercorner here and that

1286
01:18:04,521 --> 01:18:06,950
it could have been interesting to do.
Um,

1287
01:18:06,951 --> 01:18:10,860
and in fact in stacker of wheat we start
thinking about expert systems because

1288
01:18:10,861 --> 01:18:12,740
it's a very, you know, you can differ,

1289
01:18:12,780 --> 01:18:16,920
I mean people actually build stacker up
boards by thinking about those principle

1290
01:18:16,921 --> 01:18:21,000
like state machines and a rule based.
And then you could,

1291
01:18:21,030 --> 01:18:24,480
you could think of combining
a bit of a rule based system,

1292
01:18:24,481 --> 01:18:28,770
but that has also neuro
networks incorporated to
make it generalize that we'd

1293
01:18:28,771 --> 01:18:30,480
better. So absolutely. I mean we should,

1294
01:18:30,750 --> 01:18:34,890
we should definitely go back to those
ideas and anything that makes the problem

1295
01:18:34,891 --> 01:18:37,740
simpler as long as your problem
is important, that's okay.

1296
01:18:37,980 --> 01:18:42,120
And that's research driving a very
important problem. And on the other hand,

1297
01:18:42,121 --> 01:18:46,380
if you want to really focus on the
limits of reinforcement learning,

1298
01:18:46,590 --> 01:18:51,590
then of course you must try not to look
at a mutation data or to you to look

1299
01:18:52,201 --> 01:18:56,190
some like for some rules of the domain
that would help a lot or even feature

1300
01:18:56,191 --> 01:19:00,720
engineering, right? So these, these
attention that depending on what you do,

1301
01:19:00,721 --> 01:19:01,410
I think both,

1302
01:19:01,410 --> 01:19:06,380
both ways are definitely fine and I
would never not do one or the other if

1303
01:19:06,480 --> 01:19:09,980
you're, as long as you, what you're doing
is important and needs to be soft. Right?

1304
01:19:10,040 --> 01:19:10,750
Right.

1305
01:19:10,750 --> 01:19:15,160
Uh, so there's a bunch of
different ideas that, that um,

1306
01:19:15,220 --> 01:19:17,420
that you developed that I
really enjoy. So, but one,

1307
01:19:17,780 --> 01:19:22,450
one is a translating from
some image captioning trends,

1308
01:19:22,451 --> 01:19:26,050
any family shit text.
She's just another just beautiful,

1309
01:19:26,590 --> 01:19:30,030
beautiful idea.
I think that um,

1310
01:19:31,000 --> 01:19:33,190
resonates throughout your work actually.

1311
01:19:33,191 --> 01:19:37,480
So does the underlying nature of
reality being language always somehow.

1312
01:19:37,880 --> 01:19:42,470
Uh, so, uh, what's the connection
between images and texts,

1313
01:19:42,471 --> 01:19:46,450
the rather the visual world and
a world of language in your view?

1314
01:19:46,510 --> 01:19:47,830
Right.
So I think

1315
01:19:49,550 --> 01:19:51,850
a piece of research
that's been central to,

1316
01:19:51,910 --> 01:19:56,800
I would say even extending into starcraft
is this idea of sequence to sequence

1317
01:19:56,801 --> 01:20:00,610
learning. Which what we really
meant by that is that you can,

1318
01:20:01,270 --> 01:20:05,890
you can now really input anything
to a neural network as the input x.

1319
01:20:06,100 --> 01:20:10,740
And then low neural network will learn
a function f that will take acts as an

1320
01:20:10,741 --> 01:20:11,071
input.

1321
01:20:11,071 --> 01:20:16,071
And produce any output y and these x
and y's don't need to be like static or

1322
01:20:16,830 --> 01:20:19,140
like features like a scene,

1323
01:20:19,180 --> 01:20:22,200
like a fixed back doors
or anything like that.

1324
01:20:22,201 --> 01:20:26,070
He could be really sequences and now
beyond like data structures, right?

1325
01:20:26,520 --> 01:20:31,520
So that paradigm was tested in a very
interesting way when we moved from

1326
01:20:33,210 --> 01:20:37,900
translating French to English to
translating an image too. It's caption,

1327
01:20:37,910 --> 01:20:40,690
but the beauty,
the beauty of it is that really,

1328
01:20:40,691 --> 01:20:42,940
and that's actually how it happened.
I ran,

1329
01:20:43,060 --> 01:20:46,990
I change a line of code in this thing
that was doing machine translation.

1330
01:20:47,200 --> 01:20:50,390
I and I came the next
day and I saw how it,

1331
01:20:50,460 --> 01:20:54,860
like it was producing captions that
seemed like, Oh my God, this is really,

1332
01:20:54,861 --> 01:20:57,500
really working. And the
principle is the same, right?

1333
01:20:57,501 --> 01:21:01,020
So I think I don't see texts,

1334
01:21:01,880 --> 01:21:06,560
vision, speech waveforms
as something different. Um,

1335
01:21:07,320 --> 01:21:12,320
eat as long as you basically learn a
function that will vectorize you know,

1336
01:21:13,970 --> 01:21:18,920
these into. And then after we vectorize
it, we can then use transformers.

1337
01:21:18,921 --> 01:21:23,600
LSTM is whatever the flavor of the month
of the model is a and then as long as

1338
01:21:23,601 --> 01:21:27,020
we have enough supervised
data, really, um,

1339
01:21:27,110 --> 01:21:30,020
these formula will work
and we'll keep working,

1340
01:21:30,021 --> 01:21:34,070
I believe to some extent model of these
generalization issues that I mentioned

1341
01:21:34,071 --> 01:21:34,904
before.

1342
01:21:34,990 --> 01:21:35,171
So,

1343
01:21:35,171 --> 01:21:40,060
but the testers to vectorize sort of
former representation as meaningful and

1344
01:21:40,061 --> 01:21:44,710
your intuition now having worked with
all this media is that once you, uh,

1345
01:21:44,740 --> 01:21:46,510
are able to form that representation,

1346
01:21:46,511 --> 01:21:51,220
you could basically take any things
and you sequence is there, the,

1347
01:21:51,280 --> 01:21:55,330
going back to starcraft, is
there limits on the length, uh,

1348
01:21:55,331 --> 01:21:58,930
so that we didn't really
touch on the long term aspect.

1349
01:21:59,470 --> 01:22:03,760
How did you overcome the whole really
long term aspect of things here?

1350
01:22:03,761 --> 01:22:05,540
Is there some tricks or zone?

1351
01:22:05,980 --> 01:22:07,890
The main street,
so starcraft,

1352
01:22:08,400 --> 01:22:11,490
if you look at absolutely every
frame you might think it's,

1353
01:22:11,491 --> 01:22:15,810
it's quite a long game.
So we would have to multiply 22 times,

1354
01:22:16,910 --> 01:22:21,710
60 seconds per minute times, maybe at
least 10 minutes per game on average.

1355
01:22:21,740 --> 01:22:25,250
So there are quite a few frames,

1356
01:22:25,610 --> 01:22:30,150
but the trick really was
too only observed in fact,

1357
01:22:30,151 --> 01:22:32,250
which may be seen as a limitation,

1358
01:22:32,251 --> 01:22:37,251
but it is also a computational advantage
only observe when you act and then what

1359
01:22:38,551 --> 01:22:43,470
the neural network decides is what is the
gap going to be until the next action.

1360
01:22:44,170 --> 01:22:49,080
Um, and if you look at most
starcraft games that we have in the,

1361
01:22:49,140 --> 01:22:51,180
in the data set that bleeds provided,

1362
01:22:51,940 --> 01:22:55,960
it turns out that most
games are actually only,

1363
01:22:55,961 --> 01:22:57,940
I mean it is still a long sequence,

1364
01:22:57,941 --> 01:23:01,600
but it's maybe like a
thousand to 1500 actions,

1365
01:23:02,050 --> 01:23:05,950
which if you start looking at Alice dms,

1366
01:23:06,130 --> 01:23:08,020
large Lstm is transformers.

1367
01:23:08,630 --> 01:23:11,590
It's not like it's not
that that difficult,

1368
01:23:11,620 --> 01:23:13,720
especially if you have
supervised learning.

1369
01:23:14,430 --> 01:23:17,550
If you had to do it with reinforcement
learning, the credit assignment problem,

1370
01:23:17,670 --> 01:23:21,210
what is it that in this game that made
you, when that will be really difficult.

1371
01:23:21,540 --> 01:23:24,100
But thankfully because
of imitation learning,

1372
01:23:24,520 --> 01:23:28,510
we didn't kind of have to deal with
these directly. Although if we had to,

1373
01:23:28,810 --> 01:23:29,590
we tried it.

1374
01:23:29,590 --> 01:23:32,620
And what happened is you just take
all your workers and attack with them.

1375
01:23:33,310 --> 01:23:34,360
And that sort of,

1376
01:23:34,420 --> 01:23:37,870
it's kind of obvious in retrospect
because you start trying random actions.

1377
01:23:38,080 --> 01:23:42,150
One of the actions will be a worker that
goes to the enemy base and because it's

1378
01:23:42,151 --> 01:23:42,970
self plate,

1379
01:23:42,970 --> 01:23:46,300
it's not going to know how to defend
because he basically doesn't know almost

1380
01:23:46,301 --> 01:23:50,920
anything. And eventually what you double
up is this, take our workers and attack.

1381
01:23:51,310 --> 01:23:55,090
Um, because the, the, the, the create
assignment issue in our rally is really,

1382
01:23:55,091 --> 01:23:55,870
really hard.

1383
01:23:55,870 --> 01:23:59,890
I do believe we could do better and
that's maybe a research challenge for the

1384
01:23:59,891 --> 01:24:03,250
future. Um, but yeah,
even even in starcraft,

1385
01:24:03,520 --> 01:24:05,470
the sequences are maybe a thousand,

1386
01:24:05,471 --> 01:24:09,910
which I believe there is within the
realm of what transformers can do.

1387
01:24:10,410 --> 01:24:10,621
Yeah.

1388
01:24:10,621 --> 01:24:15,621
I guess the difference between starcraft
and go is go and chest stuff starts

1389
01:24:16,681 --> 01:24:20,730
happening right away.
Right? So there's not, yeah,

1390
01:24:20,731 --> 01:24:22,710
it's pretty easy to self plant,
not easy,

1391
01:24:22,711 --> 01:24:26,130
but through selfless as
possible to develop reasonable
strategies as quickly as

1392
01:24:26,131 --> 01:24:27,180
opposed to starcraft.

1393
01:24:27,680 --> 01:24:32,220
In gold, there's only 400
actions, but one action ease,

1394
01:24:32,450 --> 01:24:34,160
what people would call the God action.

1395
01:24:34,161 --> 01:24:38,690
That would be if you had
expanded the whole search three,

1396
01:24:38,720 --> 01:24:39,740
that's the best action.

1397
01:24:39,770 --> 01:24:43,010
If you did mini macs or whatever
algorithm you would do if you had the

1398
01:24:43,011 --> 01:24:47,900
computational capacity. But
in starcraft, the 400 is, is,

1399
01:24:47,901 --> 01:24:50,930
is miniscule like in 400.
You don't even like you,

1400
01:24:50,960 --> 01:24:54,790
you couldn't even click on the
pixels around a unit. Right. So, um,

1401
01:24:54,860 --> 01:24:57,590
I think the problem there
is in terms of action,

1402
01:24:57,591 --> 01:25:00,410
space size is way harder.

1403
01:25:00,920 --> 01:25:03,830
So does surge is impossible.

1404
01:25:03,831 --> 01:25:07,800
So there's quite a few challenges
in deed that make these, um,

1405
01:25:08,050 --> 01:25:11,380
kind of a step step up in terms
of machine learning for humans,

1406
01:25:11,840 --> 01:25:15,950
maybe they playing starcraft is seems more
intuitive because it's, it looks real.

1407
01:25:15,951 --> 01:25:19,330
I mean, you know, like get the graphics
and everything moves smoothly. Whereas I,

1408
01:25:19,331 --> 01:25:20,420
I don't know how to,
I mean,

1409
01:25:20,421 --> 01:25:22,700
go is like a game that I
wouldn't really need to study.

1410
01:25:22,730 --> 01:25:26,960
It feels quite complicated,
but for machines kind of
maybe he the reverse. Yes.

1411
01:25:27,050 --> 01:25:27,171
Well,

1412
01:25:27,171 --> 01:25:31,370
it shows you the gap actually between a
deep learning and however the heck our

1413
01:25:31,371 --> 01:25:33,180
brains work.
Uh,

1414
01:25:33,830 --> 01:25:37,550
so you developed a lot of really
interesting ideas. It's, it's to just ask,

1415
01:25:37,580 --> 01:25:40,910
what's the, what's your process
of developing new ideas?

1416
01:25:41,150 --> 01:25:45,710
Do you like brainstorming with others? Do
you like thinking alone? Do you like a,

1417
01:25:46,600 --> 01:25:47,270
uh,

1418
01:25:47,270 --> 01:25:51,070
like a, was it Ian Goodfellow said he
came up with gans after a few beers.

1419
01:25:51,590 --> 01:25:55,370
Uh, right. He thinks beers are
essential for coming up and new ideas.

1420
01:25:55,850 --> 01:25:59,720
We had beers to decide to play
another game game of or after a week.

1421
01:25:59,721 --> 01:26:02,690
So it's really similar to that story.

1422
01:26:02,691 --> 01:26:04,750
Actually explain these in a,

1423
01:26:04,850 --> 01:26:08,120
in a deepmind retreat and I said this
is the same as the gun story. I mean,

1424
01:26:08,121 --> 01:26:10,980
we were in a bar and we decided
let's play again next weekend.

1425
01:26:11,030 --> 01:26:11,863
That's what happened.

1426
01:26:11,870 --> 01:26:15,520
I feel like we're doing the wrong
message to young undergrads. Yeah, no,

1427
01:26:15,740 --> 01:26:19,370
but in general, like, yeah. Do you like
brainstorming? Do you like thinking alone,

1428
01:26:19,371 --> 01:26:21,320
working stuff out?
And so I think,

1429
01:26:21,321 --> 01:26:24,680
I think throughout the years also
things change, right? So, um,

1430
01:26:24,860 --> 01:26:29,000
initially I was very fortunate to be,
um,

1431
01:26:29,300 --> 01:26:33,980
with great minds like Geoff Hinton,
Jeff Dean Elliott, Sutzkever.

1432
01:26:34,140 --> 01:26:37,340
I was really fortunate to join
brain at a very good time.

1433
01:26:37,670 --> 01:26:39,950
So at that point it ideas,

1434
01:26:39,951 --> 01:26:44,750
I was just kind of brainstorming with
my colleagues and learned a lot and keep

1435
01:26:44,751 --> 01:26:47,930
learning is actually something you
should never stop doing. Right?

1436
01:26:48,140 --> 01:26:53,030
So learning implies reading papers
and also discussing ideas with others.

1437
01:26:53,210 --> 01:26:58,210
It's very hard at some point
to not communicate that
being reading a paper from,

1438
01:26:58,450 --> 01:27:02,770
from someone or actually this
cussing. Right? So definitely, um,

1439
01:27:03,140 --> 01:27:07,490
that communication aspect needs to be
there whether it's written or oral.

1440
01:27:08,020 --> 01:27:08,510
Um,

1441
01:27:08,510 --> 01:27:13,510
nowadays I'm also trying to be a bit
more strategic about what research to do.

1442
01:27:15,080 --> 01:27:20,080
So I was describing a little bit this
sort of tension between research for the

1443
01:27:20,421 --> 01:27:21,350
sake of research.

1444
01:27:21,530 --> 01:27:25,040
And then you have on the other hand
applications that can drive the research

1445
01:27:25,041 --> 01:27:26,570
right?
And honestly,

1446
01:27:26,571 --> 01:27:31,571
the formula that has worked best for me
is just find a heart problem and then

1447
01:27:32,270 --> 01:27:36,020
try to see how research feeds into it,
how it doesn't fit into it,

1448
01:27:36,200 --> 01:27:37,520
and then you must innovate.

1449
01:27:37,790 --> 01:27:42,410
So I think machine translation
drove sequence to sequence.

1450
01:27:42,630 --> 01:27:43,010
Um,

1451
01:27:43,010 --> 01:27:48,010
then maybe like learning algorithms that
had to like communitorial algorithms

1452
01:27:48,321 --> 01:27:49,670
led to pointer networks.

1453
01:27:50,460 --> 01:27:53,810
Starcraft led to really scaling
up in mutational learning.

1454
01:27:53,840 --> 01:27:58,070
And the Alpha Star League. So that's
been a formula that I personally like,

1455
01:27:58,340 --> 01:27:59,960
but the other one is also buried.

1456
01:27:59,961 --> 01:28:04,730
And I seen it succeed a lot of the
times where you just want to investigate

1457
01:28:04,880 --> 01:28:08,180
model based RL as,
as a kind of a research topic.

1458
01:28:08,181 --> 01:28:12,170
And then you must then start to
think, well, how are the tests?

1459
01:28:12,171 --> 01:28:14,190
How are you going to test these ideas?
Um,

1460
01:28:14,240 --> 01:28:17,930
you need to kind of a minimal
environment to try things.

1461
01:28:17,931 --> 01:28:20,990
You need to read a lot of papers and
so on. And that's also very fun to do.

1462
01:28:20,991 --> 01:28:25,070
And something I've also done quite
a few times, um, both at, at brain,

1463
01:28:25,071 --> 01:28:28,210
at the mine and obviously
as, as a PLC. So,

1464
01:28:28,950 --> 01:28:32,870
so I think besides the,
the ideas and discussions,

1465
01:28:32,871 --> 01:28:37,871
I think it's important also because you
start sort of guiding not only your own

1466
01:28:39,710 --> 01:28:43,860
goals but other people's goals,
um, to the next breakthrough.

1467
01:28:43,880 --> 01:28:47,450
So you must really kind of
understand these, you know,

1468
01:28:47,720 --> 01:28:50,390
feasibility also as we were
discussing before, right?

1469
01:28:50,400 --> 01:28:53,780
Weather whether these domain
is ready to be tackled or not.

1470
01:28:54,080 --> 01:28:56,990
And you don't want to be too early.
You obviously don't want to be too late.

1471
01:28:56,991 --> 01:29:01,100
So it's, it's really interesting. Um,
these are strategic component of research,

1472
01:29:01,110 --> 01:29:06,110
which I think as a Grad student I just
had no idea to read papers and discussed

1473
01:29:07,080 --> 01:29:11,820
ideas and I think this has been maybe
the major change and I recommend people

1474
01:29:12,090 --> 01:29:16,350
kind of feed forward to success how it
looks like and try to back track other

1475
01:29:16,351 --> 01:29:19,230
than just kind of looking out at
these looks cool, these looks cool.

1476
01:29:19,231 --> 01:29:21,090
And then you do a bit of random work,

1477
01:29:21,091 --> 01:29:25,320
which sometimes you stumble upon some
interesting things. But in general it's,

1478
01:29:25,321 --> 01:29:28,620
it's also good to plan a
bit. Yeah. Like it, uh,

1479
01:29:29,040 --> 01:29:32,040
especially like your approach of
taking a really hard problems,

1480
01:29:32,041 --> 01:29:35,870
stepping right in and then being
super skeptical about yeah. Being

1481
01:29:37,370 --> 01:29:40,140
a, I mean there, there's
a balance of both, right?

1482
01:29:40,141 --> 01:29:44,460
There's a silly optimism and a,
and a critical,

1483
01:29:44,760 --> 01:29:47,820
uh, sort of a skepticism
that's good to balance,

1484
01:29:48,490 --> 01:29:52,800
which is why it's good to have a team
of people that's that balance that you

1485
01:29:52,801 --> 01:29:53,910
don't do that on your own.

1486
01:29:53,911 --> 01:29:58,830
You have both mentors that have seen
or you obviously you want to chat and

1487
01:29:58,880 --> 01:30:00,900
discuss whether it's the right time.

1488
01:30:00,901 --> 01:30:05,901
I mean that means came in 2014 and he
said maybe in a beat we'll do starcraft

1489
01:30:06,571 --> 01:30:10,620
and maybe he knew and that's,
and I'm just following his lead,

1490
01:30:10,621 --> 01:30:13,940
which is great because he's,
he's brilliant, right? So these,

1491
01:30:13,950 --> 01:30:18,950
these things are obviously quite important
that you want to be surrounded by

1492
01:30:20,371 --> 01:30:23,730
people who, you know, are diverse.
They have their knowledge,

1493
01:30:23,731 --> 01:30:27,060
their there is also important
too. I mean, I, I've,

1494
01:30:27,061 --> 01:30:32,040
I've learned a lot from
people who actually have an
idea that I might not think

1495
01:30:32,041 --> 01:30:36,150
it's good, but if I give them the space
to try it, I've been proven wrong many,

1496
01:30:36,151 --> 01:30:39,960
many times as well. So that's
great. It's, I think it's, um,

1497
01:30:40,350 --> 01:30:45,060
your colleagues are more important
than yourself. I think so. Sure. Now,

1498
01:30:45,080 --> 01:30:49,980
uh, let's real quick talk about another
impossible problem. Uh, Agi, right?

1499
01:30:50,340 --> 01:30:54,060
What do you think it takes to build a
system that's human level intelligence?

1500
01:30:54,061 --> 01:30:57,750
We talked a little bit about the Turing
test dark after all these have echoes of

1501
01:30:57,780 --> 01:30:58,710
general intelligence.

1502
01:30:58,980 --> 01:31:03,390
But if you think about just something
that you would sit back and say, wow,

1503
01:31:03,420 --> 01:31:07,800
this is really something that
resembles human level intelligence,

1504
01:31:07,801 --> 01:31:09,120
what do you think it takes to build that?

1505
01:31:09,540 --> 01:31:12,930
So I find that Agi,

1506
01:31:13,260 --> 01:31:16,620
oftentimes it's maybe
not very well defined.

1507
01:31:17,190 --> 01:31:22,190
So what I'm trying to then come up with
for myself is what would be a result

1508
01:31:23,250 --> 01:31:23,970
look like?

1509
01:31:23,970 --> 01:31:28,620
That you would start to believe that you
would have agents or neural nets that

1510
01:31:28,621 --> 01:31:31,560
no longer sort of over feet
to a single task, right?

1511
01:31:31,860 --> 01:31:36,860
But actually kind of learn
the skill of learning,

1512
01:31:36,900 --> 01:31:41,430
so to speak. And that actually is
a field that I am fascinated by,

1513
01:31:41,431 --> 01:31:44,790
which is the learning to
learn or metal learning,

1514
01:31:45,000 --> 01:31:48,240
which is about no longer
learning about the single domain.

1515
01:31:48,600 --> 01:31:52,560
So you can think about the learning
algorithm itself is general, right?

1516
01:31:52,680 --> 01:31:56,790
So the same formula we applied
for Alpha star or starcraft,

1517
01:31:56,791 --> 01:32:01,720
we can now apply to kind of almost any
video or you could apply to many other

1518
01:32:01,721 --> 01:32:06,570
problems and domains. But the algorithm
is what's kind of generalizing,

1519
01:32:07,020 --> 01:32:08,820
but the neural network,
the weights,

1520
01:32:08,850 --> 01:32:12,060
those weights are useless even
to play another race. Right?

1521
01:32:12,061 --> 01:32:15,150
I train a network to play very
well at products versus products.

1522
01:32:15,420 --> 01:32:17,160
I need to throw away those weights.

1523
01:32:17,670 --> 01:32:20,600
If I want to play now Taryn versus Taryn,

1524
01:32:20,610 --> 01:32:24,750
I would need to retrain and Edward
from scratch we'd the same algorithm.

1525
01:32:24,810 --> 01:32:29,520
That's beautiful but the network itself
will not be useful. So I think when I,

1526
01:32:29,610 --> 01:32:34,610
if I see an approach that can absorb or
start solving new problems without the

1527
01:32:37,711 --> 01:32:39,660
need to kind of restart the process,

1528
01:32:40,080 --> 01:32:44,970
I think that to me would be a nice
way to define some form of Agi.

1529
01:32:45,600 --> 01:32:48,060
Again,
either know the grandiose like age,

1530
01:32:48,090 --> 01:32:51,510
I mean he should during test we saw
before Agi. I mean I don't know. I think,

1531
01:32:51,750 --> 01:32:56,750
I think concretely I would like to see
clearly that metal learning happen.

1532
01:32:56,910 --> 01:33:01,910
Meaning there there is and architecture
or network that as it sees new,

1533
01:33:02,440 --> 01:33:07,440
new problem or new data it solves it
and to make it kind of a benchmark,

1534
01:33:08,290 --> 01:33:11,350
each should solve it at the same
speed that we do solve new problems.

1535
01:33:11,351 --> 01:33:14,860
When I define your new object and
you have to recognize it. When I,

1536
01:33:15,040 --> 01:33:17,470
when you start playing a new game,
you played all the time, the games,

1537
01:33:17,471 --> 01:33:21,530
but now you play a new Atari game. Well
you, you're going to be pretty quickly,

1538
01:33:21,531 --> 01:33:24,960
pretty good at the game.
So that's perhaps what,

1539
01:33:25,040 --> 01:33:28,030
what's the domain and what's the
exact benchmark is a bit difficult.

1540
01:33:28,031 --> 01:33:31,180
I think as a community we might
need to do some work to define it,

1541
01:33:32,650 --> 01:33:36,850
but I think this first step I could
see it happen relatively soon,

1542
01:33:36,851 --> 01:33:40,620
but then the whole,
what Agi means and so on,

1543
01:33:40,630 --> 01:33:44,560
I am a bit more confused about what
I think people mean different things.

1544
01:33:44,800 --> 01:33:49,760
There's an emotional,
psychological level that, um,

1545
01:33:50,580 --> 01:33:54,490
like even the Turing test passing the
Turing test is something that we just pass

1546
01:33:54,491 --> 01:33:59,140
judgment on as human beings. What it
means to be, you know, as a, as a,

1547
01:33:59,141 --> 01:34:03,850
as a dog a is an s an AGI system.
Yeah.

1548
01:34:03,910 --> 01:34:07,510
Like what level? What does it mean? Uh,
right? Yeah. What does, what does it mean?

1549
01:34:07,511 --> 01:34:08,950
But I liked the generalization,

1550
01:34:08,951 --> 01:34:13,150
and maybe as a community would converge
towards a group of domains that are

1551
01:34:13,151 --> 01:34:14,710
sufficiently far away.

1552
01:34:14,980 --> 01:34:18,510
There'll be really damn impressive
if Fossa able to generalize some,

1553
01:34:18,520 --> 01:34:23,110
perhaps not as close as protests.
And Zurg was like, yeah,

1554
01:34:23,180 --> 01:34:26,380
could be a good stuff.
And then the really good stuff,

1555
01:34:26,381 --> 01:34:31,030
but then then like could from starcraft
two Wikipedia. Yeah. And back. Yeah.

1556
01:34:31,230 --> 01:34:34,660
That kind of thing. And that, that
feels also quite hard and far. But

1557
01:34:35,120 --> 01:34:39,980
I think this, as long as
you put a benchmark out, as
we discovered for instance,

1558
01:34:39,981 --> 01:34:43,010
with image net,
then tremendous progress can be had.

1559
01:34:43,011 --> 01:34:45,560
So I think maybe there's
a lack of benchmark,

1560
01:34:46,430 --> 01:34:48,930
but I'm sure we'll find one
and the community, we'll,

1561
01:34:48,931 --> 01:34:51,630
we'll then work towards that.
MMM.

1562
01:34:52,430 --> 01:34:56,390
And then beyond what Agi
might mean or would imply,

1563
01:34:56,990 --> 01:35:01,990
I really am hopeful to see basically
machine learning or AI just scaling up and

1564
01:35:03,291 --> 01:35:08,291
helping people that might not have the
resources to hire an assistant or that,

1565
01:35:10,070 --> 01:35:13,790
uh, they might not even know what the
weather is like, but you know, so,

1566
01:35:13,791 --> 01:35:17,990
so I think there's, in terms of the
impact, the positive impact of Ai,

1567
01:35:17,991 --> 01:35:22,040
I think that's maybe what we
should also not lose focus, right?

1568
01:35:22,050 --> 01:35:26,360
The research community building edgy. I
mean, that's a real nice goal, but a man,

1569
01:35:26,361 --> 01:35:28,460
I think the way that deep mind puts it is,

1570
01:35:28,461 --> 01:35:32,900
and then use it to solve everything else.
Right? So I think we should penalize.

1571
01:35:33,470 --> 01:35:35,230
Yeah.
We shouldn't forget of all the,

1572
01:35:35,231 --> 01:35:38,170
all the positive things that are actually
coming out of AI already and they're

1573
01:35:38,480 --> 01:35:42,900
going to be coming out. Right. But that,

1574
01:35:43,250 --> 01:35:46,490
and then, no, let me ask, uh,
relative to the popular perception,

1575
01:35:47,120 --> 01:35:51,500
do you have any worry about
the existential threat of
artificial intelligence in

1576
01:35:51,501 --> 01:35:54,680
the near or far future
that some people have?

1577
01:35:55,140 --> 01:35:59,310
I think I'm in the near future. I'm, I'm
skeptical, so I'm hope I'm not wrong.

1578
01:35:59,340 --> 01:36:02,400
But I'm, um, I'm not concerned,

1579
01:36:02,401 --> 01:36:04,410
but I appreciate efforts,

1580
01:36:04,740 --> 01:36:09,540
ongoing efforts and even
like whole research field
on AI safety emerging and in

1581
01:36:09,541 --> 01:36:13,620
conferences and so on. I think
that's great. Um, in the long term,

1582
01:36:14,290 --> 01:36:19,290
I really hope we just can't simply have
the benefits outweigh the potential

1583
01:36:19,791 --> 01:36:23,330
dangers. I am hopeful for that. Um,

1584
01:36:23,360 --> 01:36:27,890
but also we must remain vigilant to
kind of monitor and assess whether the

1585
01:36:27,891 --> 01:36:31,220
tradeoffs are, are there and, and,
and we have, you know, enough,

1586
01:36:31,850 --> 01:36:36,600
I'm also lead time to prevent or
to redirect our efforts if need be.

1587
01:36:36,601 --> 01:36:38,490
Right. So, um, but I'm, I'm quite,

1588
01:36:38,550 --> 01:36:43,550
I'm quite optimistic about the technology
and definitely more fearful of other

1589
01:36:44,311 --> 01:36:48,630
threats in terms of planetary
level, um, at, at this point.

1590
01:36:48,631 --> 01:36:52,500
But obviously that's the one
I kind of have more power on.

1591
01:36:52,501 --> 01:36:57,270
So clearly I do start thinking more
and more about these and it's kind of,

1592
01:36:57,980 --> 01:37:02,150
it's grown in me actually to,
to start reading more about AI safety,

1593
01:37:02,151 --> 01:37:06,050
which is a fuel that so far I have
not really contributed to, but maybe

1594
01:37:06,250 --> 01:37:08,890
there's something to be done there as
well. I think it's really important.

1595
01:37:08,950 --> 01:37:11,470
You know, I, I talk
about this a few folks,

1596
01:37:11,471 --> 01:37:15,610
but it's important to ask you and shove
it in your head because you're at the

1597
01:37:15,611 --> 01:37:19,390
leading edge of actually, uh, what
people are excited about and AI,

1598
01:37:19,391 --> 01:37:21,400
I mean the work with Alpha star it,

1599
01:37:21,510 --> 01:37:25,990
it's arguably at the very cutting edge
of the kind of thing that people are

1600
01:37:25,991 --> 01:37:30,910
afraid of.
And so you speaking to that fact and uh,

1601
01:37:30,930 --> 01:37:34,360
that we're actually quite far away to
the kind of thing that people might be

1602
01:37:34,390 --> 01:37:39,280
afraid of, but it's still worthwhile
to think about in a salsa.

1603
01:37:39,281 --> 01:37:41,910
Good that you're, uh, the,

1604
01:37:41,911 --> 01:37:44,930
you're not as worried and
you're also open to us.

1605
01:37:45,000 --> 01:37:47,760
Yeah, I mean there's two aspects.
I mean me not being worried,

1606
01:37:47,761 --> 01:37:52,280
but obviously we should prepare
for four, four, eight rides for,

1607
01:37:52,320 --> 01:37:56,990
for like, for, for things that could go
wrong. Misuse of the technologies as,

1608
01:37:56,991 --> 01:38:01,110
as with any technology is,
right. So I think there's,

1609
01:38:01,200 --> 01:38:03,930
there's always trade offs and I,
as a society,

1610
01:38:03,931 --> 01:38:07,350
we've kind of solved these to
some extent with in the past.

1611
01:38:07,351 --> 01:38:12,351
So I'm hoping that by having
the researchers and the
whole community brainstorm

1612
01:38:13,471 --> 01:38:17,550
and come up with interesting solutions
to the new things that will happen in the

1613
01:38:17,551 --> 01:38:18,384
future,

1614
01:38:18,930 --> 01:38:23,490
that we can still also push the research
to the avenue that I think is kind of

1615
01:38:23,491 --> 01:38:27,720
the greatest avenue, which is to
understand intelligence, right?

1616
01:38:27,750 --> 01:38:30,750
How are we doing what we're
doing? Um, and you know,

1617
01:38:30,751 --> 01:38:35,160
obviously from a scientific standpoint
that is kind of the drive my personal

1618
01:38:35,161 --> 01:38:39,360
driver or all the time I spend
doing what I'm doing. Really.

1619
01:38:40,050 --> 01:38:42,750
Where do you see the deep
learning as a field heading?

1620
01:38:42,990 --> 01:38:46,260
What do you think the next
big, big breakthrough? My B.

1621
01:38:46,770 --> 01:38:50,460
So I think deep learning,
I discuss a little of these before.

1622
01:38:50,730 --> 01:38:55,730
Deep learning has to be combined with
some form of democratization programs,

1623
01:38:56,011 --> 01:38:56,640
indices.

1624
01:38:56,640 --> 01:39:01,470
I think that's kind of as a researching
itself is an interesting topic to expand

1625
01:39:01,471 --> 01:39:03,980
and start doing more research.
Uh,

1626
01:39:04,080 --> 01:39:08,400
and then as kind of what we'll deep
learning and able to do in the future.

1627
01:39:08,610 --> 01:39:11,250
I don't think that's going to be
what's going to happen this year,

1628
01:39:11,460 --> 01:39:16,460
but also this idea of starting not to
throw away all the ways that this idea of

1629
01:39:17,611 --> 01:39:21,100
learning to learn and really having,
um,

1630
01:39:21,180 --> 01:39:25,350
these agents not having to
restart their weights. And you,

1631
01:39:25,351 --> 01:39:30,351
you can have an agent that is kind of
solving or classifying images on image net

1632
01:39:31,050 --> 01:39:34,910
but also generating speech if you
ask it to generate some speech. And,

1633
01:39:34,911 --> 01:39:39,570
and it should really be kind
of almost the same network,

1634
01:39:39,810 --> 01:39:41,760
but my boat, none. That might
not be a neural network.

1635
01:39:41,761 --> 01:39:45,330
It might be a neural network with a
optimization algorithm attached to it.

1636
01:39:45,600 --> 01:39:50,600
But I think this idea of generalization
to new task is something that we first

1637
01:39:50,791 --> 01:39:54,660
must defined good benchmarks, but then,
uh, I think that's going to be exciting.

1638
01:39:54,661 --> 01:39:57,930
And I'm not sure how close we are,
but I think there's,

1639
01:39:58,320 --> 01:40:00,620
if you have a very limited domain,
um,

1640
01:40:00,900 --> 01:40:05,790
I think we can start doing some progress
and more much like how we did a lot of

1641
01:40:05,791 --> 01:40:08,550
programs in computer vision,
we should start thinking,

1642
01:40:08,850 --> 01:40:13,560
am I real like a talk that I gave that
[inaudible] cave at ICML a few years ago,

1643
01:40:13,830 --> 01:40:17,880
which is these trained tests paradigm
should be broken. We, you know,

1644
01:40:17,881 --> 01:40:21,200
we should stop thinking about
a training test at, at, sorry,

1645
01:40:21,201 --> 01:40:24,840
a training set and a test set
and these are closed, you know,

1646
01:40:24,841 --> 01:40:28,140
things that are untouchable.
I think we should go beyond these.

1647
01:40:28,141 --> 01:40:31,950
And in metal learning we call these the
metta training set and the metatarsal,

1648
01:40:32,100 --> 01:40:37,080
which is really thinking about,
if I know about image net,

1649
01:40:37,290 --> 01:40:41,310
why would that network not
work on [inaudible], which
is a much simpler problem.

1650
01:40:41,340 --> 01:40:46,170
But right now it really doesn't it, you
know, but it, it just feels wrong. Right?

1651
01:40:46,171 --> 01:40:49,980
So I think that's kind
of the, there's the, uh,

1652
01:40:49,981 --> 01:40:52,020
on the application or the benchmark sites,

1653
01:40:52,130 --> 01:40:57,130
we probably see quite a few more interest
and progress and hopefully people

1654
01:40:57,691 --> 01:41:00,560
defining new and exciting
challenge is really,

1655
01:41:00,950 --> 01:41:05,240
do you have any hope or interest and
knowledge graphs within this context?

1656
01:41:05,241 --> 01:41:10,130
So this is kind of totally,
yeah. Constructing Gra.
So going back now, graphs,

1657
01:41:10,190 --> 01:41:12,110
yeah,
well neural networks and graphs,

1658
01:41:12,111 --> 01:41:15,400
but I mean a different kind of
knowledge graph. Uh, uh, sort of, uh,

1659
01:41:15,740 --> 01:41:17,780
like semantic grass or there's concepts.

1660
01:41:18,010 --> 01:41:22,970
Yeah. So I think, I think the,
um, the idea of graphs is,

1661
01:41:22,971 --> 01:41:27,790
is, so I've been quite
interested in sequences first
and then more interesting or

1662
01:41:27,791 --> 01:41:32,320
different data structures like graphs.
And I've studied graph neural networks,

1663
01:41:32,340 --> 01:41:35,070
um, in the last three years or so. I, uh,

1664
01:41:35,220 --> 01:41:40,220
I found these models just very
interesting from like deep learning sites

1665
01:41:40,750 --> 01:41:44,610
standpoint. Um, but then
how, how, what do we want,

1666
01:41:44,640 --> 01:41:47,280
why do we want these models are,
and why would we use them?

1667
01:41:47,281 --> 01:41:50,970
What's the application? What's kind of
the killer application of graphs? Right,

1668
01:41:50,971 --> 01:41:51,380
right.

1669
01:41:51,380 --> 01:41:56,380
And perhaps if we could extract a
knowledge graph from Wiki automatically,

1670
01:42:01,350 --> 01:42:06,120
that would be interesting because then
these graphs have these very interesting

1671
01:42:06,121 --> 01:42:10,860
structure that also is a bit more
comfortable with this idea of programs and

1672
01:42:10,890 --> 01:42:14,820
deep learning, kind of working together,
the jumping neighborhoods and so on.

1673
01:42:14,821 --> 01:42:18,780
You could imagine defining some primitives
to, to go around and graphs. Right.

1674
01:42:18,781 --> 01:42:23,781
So I think I really liked the idea of
a knowledge graph and in fact when we,

1675
01:42:26,730 --> 01:42:31,620
we started or you know, as part of the
research we did for starcraft, I thought,

1676
01:42:31,621 --> 01:42:36,180
wouldn't it be cool to give
the graph of all the Prereq?

1677
01:42:36,240 --> 01:42:40,230
There's like there's all these buildings
that depend on each other and you need

1678
01:42:40,231 --> 01:42:42,420
that, have prerequisites
of being billed by that.

1679
01:42:42,421 --> 01:42:46,920
And so this is information that
the network can learn an extract,

1680
01:42:46,921 --> 01:42:50,050
but it would have been great to see,
um,

1681
01:42:50,130 --> 01:42:54,540
or to think of really starcraft as a
giant graph that even also as the game

1682
01:42:54,541 --> 01:42:58,790
evolves, you just kind of started taking
branches and so on. And we try, we, we,

1683
01:42:58,810 --> 01:43:02,820
the bit of research on these,
nothing too relevant. Um, but I,

1684
01:43:02,880 --> 01:43:03,960
I really liked the idea

1685
01:43:04,140 --> 01:43:05,600
and it has elements that are,

1686
01:43:05,630 --> 01:43:08,270
which something you also worked
with in terms of visualizing,

1687
01:43:08,271 --> 01:43:12,560
you'll network says elements of
having human interpretable, uh,

1688
01:43:13,260 --> 01:43:17,010
being able to generate
knowledge representations
that are human interpretable

1689
01:43:17,011 --> 01:43:20,910
that maybe human experts can then
tweak or at least understand the,

1690
01:43:20,920 --> 01:43:24,000
so there's a lot of interesting
aspect there. And for me personally,

1691
01:43:24,001 --> 01:43:28,170
I'm just a huge fan of Wikipedia
and, and it's a shame that, uh,

1692
01:43:28,190 --> 01:43:31,380
our neural networks aren't
taking advantage of all the
structured knowledge and

1693
01:43:31,381 --> 01:43:36,360
that's on the web. What's next for,
uh, for you, what's next for deep mind?

1694
01:43:36,361 --> 01:43:39,090
What are you excited about?
What a for Alpha Star.

1695
01:43:39,660 --> 01:43:39,931
Yeah,

1696
01:43:39,931 --> 01:43:44,931
so I think the obvious next steps
would be too apply Alpha star too.

1697
01:43:47,290 --> 01:43:47,951
Other races.

1698
01:43:47,951 --> 01:43:52,951
I mean that's sort of shows
that the algorithm works
because we wouldn't want to

1699
01:43:53,571 --> 01:43:58,340
have created by mistake something in the
architecture that happens to work for

1700
01:43:58,341 --> 01:44:00,080
protests but not for other races.
Right.

1701
01:44:00,081 --> 01:44:05,060
So Asbury effication I think that's an
obvious next step that we are working on.

1702
01:44:05,660 --> 01:44:09,050
And then I would like to see,

1703
01:44:09,210 --> 01:44:14,210
so agents and players can specialize on
different skillsets that allow them to

1704
01:44:14,451 --> 01:44:15,590
be very good.

1705
01:44:15,950 --> 01:44:20,600
I think we've seen Alpha
start understanding very
well when to take battles and

1706
01:44:20,601 --> 01:44:22,130
when to not to do that.
Do that.

1707
01:44:22,400 --> 01:44:27,020
Also very good at micro management
and moving the units around and so on.

1708
01:44:27,440 --> 01:44:32,390
And also very good at producing nonstop
and trading of economy with building

1709
01:44:32,420 --> 01:44:33,253
units.

1710
01:44:33,350 --> 01:44:38,350
But I have not perhaps seen as much as
I would like this idea of the poker idea

1711
01:44:38,961 --> 01:44:39,890
that you mentioned.
Right.

1712
01:44:40,450 --> 01:44:45,410
I'm not sure it's stacked graph or
Alpha star rather has developed a deep

1713
01:44:45,411 --> 01:44:50,411
understanding of what the opponent is
doing and reacting to that and sort of

1714
01:44:50,661 --> 01:44:55,400
trying to to, to treat the player to
do something else or that, you know,

1715
01:44:55,401 --> 01:44:58,310
so these kinds of reasoning
I would like to see more.

1716
01:44:58,311 --> 01:45:01,460
So I think purely from a
research standpoint, um,

1717
01:45:01,610 --> 01:45:03,170
there's perhaps also quite a few,

1718
01:45:03,390 --> 01:45:06,350
a few things to be done there in
the domain of starcraft. Yeah.

1719
01:45:06,351 --> 01:45:10,360
In the domain of games. I've seen
some interesting work in sort of a,

1720
01:45:10,740 --> 01:45:13,730
and even auctions
manipulating other players.

1721
01:45:13,760 --> 01:45:18,600
So forming a bleed state and just
messing with people. So theory of mind.

1722
01:45:19,460 --> 01:45:23,600
Yep. So it's a fascinating,
exactly. Theory of mine on
stock, or if he's kind of,

1723
01:45:23,870 --> 01:45:25,700
they're really made for each other.

1724
01:45:26,060 --> 01:45:31,040
So that will be very exciting to see
those techniques applied to starcraft or

1725
01:45:31,100 --> 01:45:34,130
perhaps starcraft driving new
techniques. Right. As as, as I said,

1726
01:45:34,160 --> 01:45:37,520
this is always the tension
between the two. Well, oil,

1727
01:45:37,521 --> 01:45:40,610
thank you so much for talking today.
Awesome. It was great to be here. Thanks.
