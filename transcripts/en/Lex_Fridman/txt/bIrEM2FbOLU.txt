Speaker 1:          00:00:00       The following is a conversation with Greg Brockman. He's the Co founder and Cto of open Ai, a world class research organization, developing ideas and AI with a goal of eventually creating a safe and friendly artificial general intelligence, one that benefits and empowers humanity. Open Ai is not only a source of publications, algorithms, tools, and datasets. Their mission is a catalyst for an important public discourse about our future with both narrow and general intelligence systems. This conversation is part of the artificial intelligence podcasts at MIT and beyond. If you enjoy, subscribe on Youtube, iTunes, or simply connect with me on Twitter at Lex Friedman, spelled f, r I. D. And now here's my conversation with Greg Brockman. So in high school, and right after he wrote a draft of a chemistry textbook, I saw that that covers everything from basic structure of the atom to quantum mechanics. So it's clear you have an intuition and a passion for both the, uh, the physical world with chemistry and now robotics to the digital world with a AI deep learning reinforcement learning. So on. Do you see the physical world and the digital world is different? And what do you think is the gap?

Speaker 2:          00:01:20       A lot of it actually boils down to iteration. Speed, right? That I think that a lot of what really motivates me is building things right? Is the, uh, you know, think about mathematics for example, where you're thinking really hard about a problem. You understand that you're right down in this period of secure form. They call it proof. But then this is in humanities library, right? It's there forever. This is some truth that we've discovered and you know, maybe only five people in your field will ever read it, but somehow you've kind of move humanity forward. And so I actually used to really think that I was going to be a mathematician and a then I actually started writing this chemistry textbook. One of my friends told me, you'll never publish it because you don't have a phd. So instead I decided to build a website and try to promote my ideas that way.

Speaker 2:          00:01:59       And then I discovered programming. And, uh, you know that in programming you think hard about a problem, you understand it, you're right down in a very obscure a form that we call a program. But then once again, it's an humanities library, right? And anyone could get the benefit from it and the scalability is massive. And so I think that the thing that really appeals to me about the digital world is that you can have this, this, this insane leverage, right? As single individual with an idea is able to affect the entire planet. Um, and that's something I think is really hard to do if you're moving around physical atoms.

Speaker 1:          00:02:30       But you said a mathematics. So if you look at the, the wet thing over here, our mind, do you ultimately see it as just math has just information processing or is there some other magic as you've seen, if you've seen through biology and chemistry and so on?

Speaker 2:          00:02:47       I think it's really interesting to think about humans as just information processing systems and that it seems like it's actually a pretty good way of describing a lot of, of kind of how the world works are a lot of what we're capable of. To think that, you know, again, if you just look at technological innovations over time, that in some ways the most transformative innovation that we've had, it has been the computer, right? In some ways the internet, you know that what is done right? The Internet is not about these physical cables. It's about the fact that I am suddenly able to instantly communicate with any other human on the planet. I'm able to retrieve any piece of knowledge that in some ways the human race has ever had a, and those are these insane transformations. Do you see the

Speaker 3:          00:03:27       our society as a whole, the collective as another extension of the intelligence of the human being. So if you look at the human beings and information processing system, you mentioned the Internet and networking. Do you see us all together as a civilization, as a, as a kind of intelligence system?

Speaker 2:          00:03:41       Yeah, I think this is actually a really interesting perspective have to take in to think about the, you sort of have this collective intelligence of all of society. The economy itself is the superhuman machine that is optimizing something, right? And it's all in some ways a company has a will of its own right, that you have all these individuals who are all pursuing their own individual goals and thinking really hard and thinking about the right things to do. But somehow the company does something that is this emergent thing. And that is a really useful abstraction. And so I think that in some ways, you know, we think of ourselves as the most intelligent things on the planet and the most powerful things on the planet, but there are things that are bigger than us through the systems that we all contribute to. Um, and so I think actually, you know, it's a, it's interesting to think about, uh, if you've read Isaac Asimov's foundation, right, that, uh, that there's this concept of psycho history in there, which is effectively this, that if you have trillions or quadrillions of, of beings, then maybe you could actually predict what that being, that huge macro being we'll do I, and, uh, almost independent of what the individuals want.

Speaker 2:          00:04:42       I actually have a second angle on this I think is interesting, which is thinking about technological determinism. One thing that actually thinks a lot about with, with open Ai, right? It's that we're kind of coming on onto this insanely transformational technology of, of general intelligence, right? That will happen at some point. And there's a question of how can you take actions that will actually steer it to go better rather than worse? And that, I think one question you need to ask is, as a scientist, as an inventor, as a creator, what impact can you have in general, right? You look at things like the telephone invented by two people on the same day. Like what does that mean? Like, what does that mean about the shape of innovation? And I think that what's going on is everyone's building on the shoulders of the same giants. And so you can kind of, you can't really hope to create something no one else ever would, you know, if Einstein wasn't born, someone else would have come up with relativity. You know, he changed the timeline a bit, right? That maybe it would have taken another 20 years, but it wouldn't be that fundamentally humanity would never discover these, these fundamental truths. So there's some kind of invisible

Speaker 3:          00:05:39       momentum that some people like Einstein or open the eyes plugging into a that anybody else can also plug into. And ultimately that wave takes us into a certain direction. That's for sure.

Speaker 2:          00:05:51       That's right. That's right. And you know, this kind of seems to play out in a bunch of different ways, uh, that there's some exponential, it's being written and that the exponential itself, which one it is changes, think about Moore's law and an entire industry set. It's cocked to it for 50 years. Like how can that be? Right? How is that possible? And yet somehow it happened. And so I think you can't hope to ever invent something that no one else will. Maybe you can change the timeline a little bit, but if you really want to make a difference, I think that the thing that you really have to do, the only real degree of freedom you have is to set the initial conditions under which it technology is born. And so you think about the Internet, right? That there are lots of other competitors trying to build similar things and the Internet one, and that the initial conditions where there was created by this group that really valued people being able to be, uh, you know, anyone being able to plug in this very academic mindset of, of being open and connected. And I think that the Internet for the next 40 years really played out that way. Um, you know, maybe today, uh, if things are starting to shift in a, in a different direction, but I think that those initial conditions were really important to determine the next 40 years worth of progress. That's really beautifully put. So another example of that I think about,

Speaker 3:          00:06:58       you know, I recently looked at it, I looked at Wikipedia, the formation of Wikipedia, and I wonder what the Internet would be like if Wikipedia had ads. Hmm. You know, there's an interesting argument that, uh, why they chose not to make it a put advertisement on Wikipedia. I think it's, uh, I think be, it is one of the greatest resources we have on the Internet. It's as assuming surprising how it works and how all it was able to aggregate all this kind of good information and the, essentially the creator Wikipedia. I don't know, there's probably some debates there, but set the initial conditions and now it carried itself forward. That's really interesting. So you're, the way you're thinking about Agi or artificial intelligence is you're focused on setting the initial conditions for the progress. That's right. That's powerful. Okay. So look into the future. If you create an AGI system like one that can ace the Turing test natural language, what do you think would be the interactions you would have with it?

Speaker 3:          00:07:55       What do you think are the questions you would ask? Like, what would be the first question you would ask it her. Him. That's right. I think that at that point, if you've really built a powerful system that is capable of shaping the future of humanity, the first question that you really should ask is how do we make sure that this plays out well? Um, and so that's actually the first question that I would ask. Powerful AGI system. So you wouldn't ask, your colleague wouldn't ask like Eylea you would ask the Gi System, oh, we've already had the conversation with Ilya, right? And everyone here. Uh, and so you want as many perspectives,

Speaker 2:          00:08:27       uh, a piece of wisdom as you can before it for answering this question. So I don't think you necessarily defer to whatever your powerful system tells you, but you use it as one input to try to figure out what to do. But, and I, I guess fundamentally what it really comes down to is if you build something really powerful and you think about it, think about, for example, the creation of, uh, of, uh, shortly after the creation of nuclear weapons, right? The most important question the world was, what's the world are going to be like, how do we set ourselves up in a place we're going to be able to survive as a species with Agi? I think the question slightly different, right? That there is a question of how do we make sure that we don't get the negative effects, but there's also the positive side, right?

Speaker 2:          00:09:06       You imagine that, you know, like, like what won't Agi be like, like what will be capable of, and I think that one of the core reasons that an Agi can powerful and transformative is actually due to technological development, right? If you have something that's capable as capable as a human and that it's much more scalable, uh, that you absolutely want that thing to go read the whole scientific literature and think about how to create cures for all the diseases, right? You want it to think about how to go and build a technologies to help us create material abundance and to figure out societal problems that we have trouble with. Like how we're supposed to clean up the environment. And you know, maybe you want this to go and invent a bunch of little robots who will go out and be biodegradable and turn ocean debris into heart, harmless molecules. And, um, I think that that, that positive side is something that I think people miss sometimes when thinking about what an Agi will be like. Um, and so I think that if you have a system that's capable of all of that, you absolutely want it to advice about how do I make sure that we're using your, uh, your kid buildings in a positive way for humanity.

Speaker 3:          00:10:09       So what do you think about that psychology that, uh, looks at all the different possible trajectories of an AGI system, many of which perhaps the majority of which are positive and nevertheless focuses on the negative trajectories. And then you get to interact with folks. You get to think about this maybe within yourself as well. Uh, you look at Sam Harris and so on. It seems to be, sorry to put it this way, but almost more fun to think about the negative possibilities, whatever that's deepen our psychology. What do you think about that and how do we deal with it? Because we want AI to help us.

Speaker 2:          00:10:44       So I think there's kind of two problems entailed in that question. The first is more of the question of how can you even picture what a world with a new technology will be like. Now, imagine we're in 1950 and I'm trying to describe Uber to someone,

Speaker 3:          00:11:02       apps and the Internet. Yeah, I mean that's, that's, that's going to be extremely complicated, but it's imaginable cool. It's,

Speaker 2:          00:11:10       it's imaginable, right? But, and now imagine being in 1950 and predicting Uber, right? And you need to describe the Internet. You need described gps. You need to describe the fact that everyone's going to have this phone in their pocket. And so I think that that just the first truth is that it is hard to picture how a transformative technology will play out in the world. Um, we've seen that before with technologies that are far less transformative than Agi will be. And so I think that that one piece is that it's just even hard to imagine and to really put yourself in a world where you can predict what that, that positive vision would be like. And you know, I think the second thing is that it is, I think it is always easier to support the negative side than the positive side. It's always easier to destroy than create and you know, less than a, in a, in a, in a physical science and more just in a, in an intellectual sense, right?

Speaker 2:          00:12:03       Because, you know, I think that that with creating something, you need to just get a bunch of things right and to destroy, you just need to get one thing wrong. Yeah. And so I think that that, what that means is that I think a lot of people's thinking dead ends as soon as they see the negative story. But that being said, I actually actually have some hope, right? I think that the, that the positive vision is something that I think can be, uh, is something that we can, we can talk about. And I think that just simply saying this fact of, yeah, like there's positives, there's negatives. Everyone likes to dwell on the negative. People have to respond well to that message and say, Huh, you're right. There's a part of this that we're not talking about not thinking about. And that's actually something that's, that's that's I think really been a key part of how we think about Agi at open Ai.

Speaker 2:          00:12:46       Right. You can kind of look at it is like, okay, like opening, I talks about the fact that there are risks and yet they're trying to build this system. Like how do you square those two facts? So do you share the intuition that some people have a, I mean from Sam Harris to even Elon Musk himself, that it's tricky as you develop Agi to keep it from slipping into the existential threats into the negative. What's your intuition about? How hard is it to keep AI development on the positive track and your intuition there to, to answer the question, you can really look at how we structure open Ai. So we really have three main arms that we have capabilities, which is actually doing the technical work and pushing forward what these systems can do if there's safety, which is working on technical mechanisms to ensure that the systems we build are aligned with human values.

Speaker 2:          00:13:38       And then there's policy, which is making sure that we have governance mechanisms answering that question of well, whose values? And so I think that the technical safety one is the one that people kind of talk about the most, right? You talked about like think about, you know, all of the just topic AI movies. A lot of that is about not having good technical safety in place. Um, and what we've been finding is that, you know, I think that actually a lot of people look at the technical safety problem and think it's just intractable, right? This question of what do humans want? How am I supposed to write that down? Can I even write down what I want? No Way. And then they stopped there. But the thing is we've already built systems that are able to learn things that humans can't specify. You know, even the rules for how to recognize if there's a cat or a dog in an image, but it turns out it's intractable to write that down and yet we're able to learn it.

Speaker 2:          00:14:28       And that what we're seeing with systems we built at open AI and they're still in early proof of concept stage is that you are able to learn human preferences. You're able to learn what humans want from data. Um, and so that's kind of the core focus for our technical safety team. And I think that they're actually, we've had some pretty encouraging updates in terms of what we've been able to make work. So you have an intuition in a hope that from data, you know, looking at the value alignment problem from data, we can build systems that align with the collective better angels of our nature. So align with, um, the ethics and the morals of human beings to even say this in a different way. I mean, think about how do we align humans, right? Think about like a human baby can grow up to be an evil person or a great person.

Speaker 2:          00:15:12       And a lot of that is from learning from data, right? That you have some feedback as a child is growing up, they get to see positive examples. And so I think that that just like the, the only example we have of a general intelligence that is able to learn from data I to aligned with human values and to learn values, um, I think we shouldn't be surprised that we can do the same sorts of techniques or whether the same sort of techniques end up being how we saw value alignment for Agi Gis. So let's go even a highest, I don't know if you've read the book Sapiens, but uh, there's an idea that, you know, um, that as a collective as us human beings who kind of developed together and ideas that we hold, there is no in that context, objective truth, we just kind of all agree to certain ideas and hold them as a collective.

Speaker 2:          00:16:01       Did you have a sense that there is and the world of good and evil? Do you have a sense that to the first approximation there are some things that are good and that we could teach systems to behave to be good. So I think that this actually blends into our third team, right? Which is the policy team. And this is the one, the, the aspect that he'd, people really talk about weigh less than they should, right? Because imagine that we built super powerful systems that we've managed to figure it all of the mechanisms for these things to do whatever the operator wants. The most important question becomes who's the operator, what do they want and how is that going to affect everyone else? Right. And I think that this question of what is good, what are those values? I mean I think you, you don't even have to go to those, those, those very grand exit central places to start to realize how hard this problem is.

Speaker 2:          00:16:50       You just look at different countries and cultures across the world, right? And that there's, there's a very different conception of how the world works. And you know, what, what, what kinds of ways that society wants to operate. And so I think that that the, that the really core question is, is, is, is actually a very concrete, um, and I think it's not a question that we have ready answers to, right, is how do you have a world where all of the different countries that we have United States, China, Russia, and you know, the, the, the, the hundreds of other countries out there are able to continue to not just operate in the way that, that the, that they see fit. But in, in, uh, the world that emerges in these were where you have these very powerful systems operating alongside humans ends up being something that empowers humans more, that makes like exist human existence be a more meaningful thing and a, that people are happier and wealthier and, uh, able to live more fulfilling lives. It's not an obvious thing for how to design that world once you have that very powerful system. So if

Speaker 3:          00:17:54       take a little step back and we're having it like a fascinating conversation and a opening, as in many ways a tech leader in the world. And yet we're thinking about these big existential questions, which is fascinating, really important. I think you're a leader in that space and it's a really important space of just thinking how AI affects society in a, in a big picture view. So Oscar Wilde said, we're all in the gutter, but some of us are looking at the stars and I think open AI has a charter that looks to the stars, I would say, to create intelligence, to create general intelligence, make it beneficial, safe, and collaborative. Can you tell me how that came about? How a mission like that and the path to creating a mission like that open? Yeah, I was founded.

Speaker 2:          00:18:39       Yeah. So I think that in some ways it really boils down to taking a look at the landscape, right? So if you think about the history of Ai, that basically for the past 60 or 70 years, people have thought about those goal of what could happen if you could automate human intellectual labor. Right? Okay. Imagine you can build a computer system that could do that. What becomes possible. We have a lot of Scifi that tells stories of various dystopias and you know, increasingly you have movies like heard that tell you a little bit about maybe more of a little bit utopic vision. You think about the impacts that we've seen from being able to have bicycles for our minds and computers. Uh, and that I think that the impact of, of computers and the Internet has just far outstripped what anyone really could have predicted.

Speaker 2:          00:19:26       And so I think that it's very clear that if you can build an Agi, it will be the most transformative technology that humans will ever create. And so what it boils down to then is a question of, well, is there a path? Is there hope? Is there a way to build such a system? And I think that for 60 or 70 years that people got excited and, uh, uh, that ended up not being able to deliver on the hopes that the people had pinned on them. And I think that then, you know, that after, you know, two, two winters of Ai Development, uh, that people, uh, you know, I think kind of almost stopped daring to dream, right? That they really talking about Agi or thinking about Agi became almost this taboo in the community. But I actually think that people took the wrong lesson from AI history.

Speaker 2:          00:20:10       And if you look back, starting in 1959 is when the perceptron was released. And this is basically, you know, one of the earliest neural networks. It was released to what was perceived as this massive overhype. So in the New York Times in 1959 and you have this article saying that, you know, the, the perceptron will one day recognize, people call it their names instantly translate speech between languages. And people at the time looked at this and said, this is, check your system, can't do any of that. And basically spent 10 years trying to discredit the whole perceptron direction and succeeded and all the funding dried up and you know, people kind of, uh, went in other directions and you know, the 80s, there's a resurgence and I'd always heard that the resurgence in the 80s was due to the invention of backpropagation and these, these algorithms that got people excited, but actually the causality was due to people building larger computers that you can find these, these articles from the 80 [inaudible] that the democratization of computing power suddenly meant that you could run these larger neural networks and then people start to do all these amazing things.

Speaker 2:          00:21:06       Backpropagation algorithm was invented and you know that the, the neural nets people were running were these tiny little like 20 near on neural nets. Right? Right. Like what are you supposed to learn with 20 neurons? And so of course, they weren't able to get great results and it really wasn't until 2012 that this approach, that's almost the most simple natural approach that people would come up with in the fifties. Right? In some ways, even in the forties before there were computers with the pits mackolen there in neuron, suddenly this became the best way of solving problems, right? And I think there are three core properties that deep learning has that I think are very worth paying attention to. The first is generality. We have a very small number of deep learning tools, SGD deep neural net, maybe some, some, you know RL and it solves this huge variety of problems.

Speaker 2:          00:21:55       Speech recognition, machine translation, game playing, all of these problems since small set of tools. So there's the generality, there's a second piece, which is the competence you want to solve any of those problems, throw it. 40 years worth of normal computer vision research replaced with a deep neural net. It's kind of worked better. And there's a third piece, which is the scalability, right? That one thing that has been shown time and time again is that you, if you have a larger neural network, throw more compute, more data at it, it will work better. Those three properties together feel like essential parts of building a general intelligence. Now, it doesn't just mean that if we scale up what we have, that we will have an Agi, right? They're clearly missing pieces. They're missing ideas. We need to have answers for reasoning. But I think that the core here is that for the first time it feels that we have a paradigm that gives us hope that general intelligence can be achievable.

Speaker 2:          00:22:50       And so as soon as you believe that everything else becomes, it comes into focus, right? If you imagine that you may be able to, and you know that the timeline I think remains uncertain. Um, but I think that that, you know, certainly within our lifetimes and possibly within a much shorter period of time than, than people would expect. If you can really build the most transformative technology will ever exist, you stop thinking about yourself so much, right? And you start thinking about just like how do you have a world where this goes well and that you need to think about the practicalities of how do you build an organization and get together a bunch of people and resources, um, and to make sure that people feel, uh, motivated and ready to do it. But I think that then you start thinking about, well, what if we succeed?

Speaker 2:          00:23:32       Um, and how do we make sure that when we succeed that the world is actually the place that we want ourselves to exist. And you know, almost in the Rawlsian bail sense of the word. And so that's kind of the, the broader landscape and opening. I was really formed in 2015 with that high level picture of Agi might be possible sooner than people think. And that, uh, we need to try to do our best to make sure it's going to go well. And then we spent the next couple of years really trying to figure out what does that mean, how do we do it? Um, and you know, I think that typically with accompany, you start out very small. So you want to co founder and you build a product, do you get some users, you get product market fit, you know, then at some point you raise some money, you hire people, you scale and then, uh, you know, down the road then the big companies realize he existed in, tried to kill you. Um, and for open AI it was basically everything in exactly the opposite order.

Speaker 3:          00:24:23       Uh, let me just pause for a second. You said a lot of things and let me just admire the jarring aspect of what open AI stands for, which is a daring to dream. I mean, you said it's pretty powerful. It caught me off guard because I think that's very true. The, the, the step of just daring to dream about the possibilities of creating intelligence in a positive, in a safe way, but just even creating intelligence is a, a much needed refreshing, a catalyst for the AI community. So that's, that's the starting point. Okay. So then formation

Speaker 2:          00:25:00       an AI, uh, I would just say that, you know, when we were starting opening, I, uh, that kind of the first question that we had is, is it too late to start a lab with a bunch of the best people possible? That wasn't an actual question. That was really, that was, that was the core question of uh, of, you know, we had this dinner in July of 28, 2015 and was that was, that was really what we spent the whole time talking about. And uh, you know, cause it's, you think about kind of where AI was, is that it transition from being an academic pursuit to an industrial pursuit. And so a lot of the best people were in these big research labs and that we wanted to start our own one that, you know, no matter how much resources we could accumulate would be no pale in comparison to the big tech companies. And we knew that and there was a question of are we going to be actually able to get this thing off the ground? You need critical mass. You can't just do you and a cofounder build the product, right? You really need to have a group of, you know, five to 10 people. And uh, we kind of concluded it wasn't obviously impossible. Uh, so it seems worth trying.

Speaker 3:          00:26:02       Well, you were also dreamers, so who knows, right? That's right. Okay. So this is speaking of that competing with, with the, with the big players. Um, let's talk about some of the, some of the tricky things as you think through this process of growing, of, uh, seeing how you can develop these systems at USC at scale that competes. So you recently, recently formed Openai LP and you cap profit company and now carries the name open as open as now this official company, the original nonprofit company still exists and carries the open AI nonprofit name. So can you explain what this company is, what the purpose of his is

Speaker 2:          00:26:44       and how did you arrive at the decision? Yup. To create it open Ai, the whole entity and opening I LP as a vehicle is trying to accomplish the mission of ensuring that artificial general intelligence benefits everyone. And the main way that we're trying to do that is by actually trying to build general intelligence ourselves and make sure the benefits are distributed to the world. That's the primary way. We're also fine if someone else does this right? It doesn't have to be us if someone else is going to build an Agi and make sure that the benefits don't get knocked up in one company or you know, one, one, one with one set of people, um, like we're actually fine with that. And so those ideas are baked into our charter, which is kind of the foundational document that are, describes kind of our values and how we operate.

Speaker 2:          00:27:32       Um, it was also really baked into the structure of open ILP. And so the way that we've set up opening ILP is that in the case where we succeed, right? If we actually build what we're trying to build, then investors are able to get a return. And that return is something that is kept. And so if you think of Agi in terms of the value that you could really create, you're talking about the most transformative technology ever created. It's going to create orders of magnitude more value than any existing company, and that all of that value will be owned by the world, like legally titled to the nonprofit to fulfill that mission. And so that's, that's the structure. So the mission is a powerful one and it's a, it's one that I think most people would agree with. It's how we would hope AI progresses.

Speaker 2:          00:28:22       And so how do you tie yourself to that mission? How do you make sure you did not deviate from that mission that, um, you know, other incentives that are profit driven wouldn't, don't interfere with the mission. So th this was actually a really core question for us, uh, for the past couple of years because, you know, I'd say that like the way that our history, when was that for the first year we were getting off the ground, right? We had this high level picture, but we didn't know exactly how we want it to accomplish it. And, uh, it really two years ago is when we first started realizing in order to build Agi, we're just going to need to raise way more money than we can as a nonprofit. Um, and you are talking many billions of dollars. And so the first question is how are you supposed to do that and stay true to this mission?

Speaker 2:          00:29:08       And we looked at every legal structure out there and concluded none of them are quite right for what we wanted to do. And I guess it shouldn't be too surprising if you're going to do something like crazy, unprecedented technology that you're going to have to come up with some crazy on precedent and structure to do it in. And a, a lot of, a lot of our conversation was, uh, with people at opening, I right, the people who really joined because they believe so much in this mission and thinking about how do we actually raise the resources to do it and also stay true to what we stand for. And the place you got to start is to really align on what is it that we stand for? What are those values? What's really important to us. And so I'd say that we spent about a year really compiling the opening I charter and that determines, and if you even look at the first, the first line item in there, it says that, look, we expect we're going to have to marshal huge amounts of resources, but we're going to make sure that we minimize conflict of interest with the mission.

Speaker 2:          00:29:57       And that kind of aligning on all of those pieces was the most important step towards figuring out how do we structure a company that can actually raise the resources to do what we need to do.

Speaker 3:          00:30:10       I imagine open Ai, uh, the decision to create open a LP was a really difficult one. And there was a lot of discussions as you mentioned for a year and, uh, there's different ideas perhaps to tractors within open AI, uh, sort of different paths that you could have taken. What were those concerns? What were the different paths considered? What was that process of making that decision like? Yup. Um, but so if you look actually at the opening I charter that there's almost two paths embedded within it. There is, we are primarily trying to build AGI ourselves, but we're also okay if someone else does it and this is a weird thing for a company. It's really interesting actually. Yeah, there, there is an element of competition that you do want to be the one that does it, but at the same time you, okay, somebody has us and we'll talk about that a little bit. That trade off. That's the dance. That's really interesting and I think this was the

Speaker 2:          00:31:03       core tension as we were designing opening I LP and really the opening I strategy is how do you make sure that both you have a shot at being a primary actor,

Speaker 3:          00:31:12       which really requires building an organization,

Speaker 2:          00:31:15       raising massive resources and really having the will to go and execute on some really, really hard vision. Right? You need to really sign up for a long period to go and take on a lot of pain and a lot of risk. And to do that, normally you just import the startup mindset, right? And that you think about, okay, like how do we out execute everyone if this very competitive angle. But you also have the second angle of saying that, well, the true mission isn't for open AI to build AGI. The true mission is for Agi to go well for humanity. And so how do you take all of those first actions and make sure you don't close the door on outcomes that would actually be positive and fulfill the mission? And so I think it's a very delicate balance, right? And I think that going 100% one direction and the other is clearly not the correct answer.

Speaker 2:          00:32:01       And so I think that even in terms of just how we talk about open AI and think about it, there's just like, one thing that's always in the back of my mind is to make sure that we're not just saying open your eyes goal is to build Agi, right? That it's actually much broader than that, right? That first of all, uh, you know, it's not just Agi, it's safe Agi, that's very important. But secondly, our goal isn't to be the ones to build it. Our goal is to make sure it goes well for the world. And so I think that figuring out how do you balance all of those, um, and to, to get people to really come to the table and compile the, the, like a single document that that encompasses, all of that wasn't trivial.

Speaker 3:          00:32:37       So part of the challenge here is a, your mission is, I would say beautiful, empowering and a beacon of hope for people in the research community and just people thinking about Ai. So your decisions are scrutinized more than I think a regular profit driven company. Do you feel the burden of this in the creation of the chart and just in the way you operate? Yes. Uh, so why do you lean into the burden by creating such a charter? Why not to keep it quiet? I mean, it's just

Speaker 2:          00:33:11       boils down to the, to the mission, right? Like, like I'm here and everyone else was here because we think this is the most important mission,

Speaker 3:          00:33:17       right? To dare to dream. All right. So, uh, do you think you can be good for the world or create an AGI system that's good when you're a for profit company? From my perspective, I don't understand why profit, uh, interferes with a positive impact on society. I don't understand, uh, why, uh, Google it makes most of its money from ads can't also do good for the world or other companies, Facebook, anything. I don't, I don't understand why those have to interfere. You know, that you can, um, profit isn't the thing in my view that affects the impact of a company. What affects the impact of the company is the charter, is the culture, is the, you know, the people inside. And profit is the thing that just fuels those people. So what, what are your views there?

Speaker 2:          00:34:08       Yeah, so I think it's a really good question. And there's, there's, there's some, some, you know, real like long standing debates in human society that are wrapped up in it. Uh, the way that I think about it is just think about what, what are the most impactful nonprofits in the world? What are the most impactful for profits in the world? Right? It's much easier to list the four profits. That's right. And I think that there's, there's some real truth year that the system that we set up the system for kind of how, you know, today's world is organized, um, is one that that really allows for huge impact. Um, and that the, you know, kind of part of that is that you need to be the, you know, for, for profits are, are self sustaining and able to, to kind of, you know, build on their own momentum.

Speaker 2:          00:34:51       And I think that's a really powerful thing. It's something that when it turns out that we haven't set the guardrails correctly causes problems, right? Think about logging companies that go into the forest, the rain forest, that's really bad. We don't want that. Um, and it's actually really interesting to me that kind of this, this question of how do you get positive benefits out of a for profit company. It's actually very similar to how do you get positive benefits out of an Agi. Um, right? That you have this like very powerful system. It's more powerful than any human and it's kind of autonomous in some ways. You know, it's super superhuman in a lot of axes. And somehow you have to set the guard rails to get good things to happen. But when you do, the benefits are massive. And so I think that that when, when I think about nonprofit versus for profit, I think just not enough happens in nonprofits.

Speaker 2:          00:35:36       They're very pure, but it's just kind of, you know, it's just hard to do things there, um, in for profits in some ways like too much happens. Um, but, um, if, if kind of shaped in the right way, it can actually be very positive. And so with opening NLP, we're, we're picking a road in between. Now, the thing I think is really important to recognize is that the way that we think about opening Ilp is that in the world we're Agi actually happens, right? In a world where we are successful, we built the most transformative technology ever. The amount of value we're going to create will be astronomical. And so then in that case that the, the, the cap that we have will be a small fraction of the value we create. Um, and the amount of value that goes back to investors and employees, it looks pretty similar to what would happen in a, in a pretty successful startup.

Speaker 2:          00:36:23       And that's really the case that we're optimizing for, right? That we're thinking about and the success case, making sure that the value we create, it doesn't get locked up. And I expected in another, you know, for profit companies that it's possible to do something like that. I think it's not obvious how to do it right. And I think that as a for profit company, you have a lot of fiduciary duty to your shareholders and that there are certain decisions that you just cannot make. Um, in our structure, we've set it up so that we have a fiduciary duty to the charter, right? That we always get to make the decision that is right for the charter, um, rather than even if it comes at the expense of our own stakeholders and a, and so I think that when I think about what's really important, it's not really about nonprofit versus for profit. It's really a question of if you build the Gi and you kind of, you know, communities now and this new age who benefits, whose lives are better. And I think that what's really important is to have an answer that is everyone.

Speaker 3:          00:37:20       Yeah. Which is one of the core aspects of the charter. So one concern people have, not just with open AI but with Google, Facebook, Amazon, anybody, uh, really, uh, that's, uh, that's creating impact at scale is how do we avoid, as your charter says, avoid enabling the use of AI or Agi to unduly concentrate power. Why would not accompany like open AI, keep all the power of [inaudible] system to itself, the charter, the charter. So, you know, how does the charter actualize itself in a day to day?

Speaker 2:          00:37:57       So I think that the first two to zoom out right there, the way that we structured the company so that the, the power first sort of dictating the actions, that opening I takes ultimately respite the board or the board of, of, of the nonprofit. Um, and, and the board is set up in certain ways with certain certain restrictions that you can read about in the opening I LP blog posts. But effectively the board is the, is the governing body for opening Openai LP. Um, and the board has a duty to fulfill the mission of the nonprofit. Um, and so that's kind of how we tie how we all these things together. Now there's a question of, so day to day, how do people, the individuals who in ways are the most empowered ones right now the board sort of gets to call the shots at the high level, but the people who were actually executing are the employees, right?

Speaker 2:          00:38:43       The people here on a day to day basis who have the, you know, the, the keys to the technical all kingdom. And there, I think that the answer looks a lot like, well, how does any company's values get actualized? Right? And I think that a lot of that comes down to do you need people who are here because they really believe in that mission and they believe in the charter and that they are willing to take actions that maybe our worst for them but are better for the charter. Um, and that's something that's really baked into the culture. And honestly, I think it's, uh, you know, I think that that's one of the things that we really have to work to preserve as time goes on. Um, and that's a really important part of how we think about hiring people and bringing people into open Ai.

Speaker 2:          00:39:22       So there's people here, there's people here who could speak up and say like, hold on a second. This is totally against what we stand for a culture wise. Yeah, yeah, for sure. I mean, I think that, uh, that we actually have, I think a, that's like a pretty important part of, of how we operate and how we have, even again, with designing the charter and, and designing open LP in the first place, uh, that there has been a lot of conversation with employees here. And a lot of times where employee said, wait a second, this seems like it's going in the wrong direction and let's talk about it. And so I think one thing that's, that's I think a really, and you know, here's, here's actually one thing that I think is very unique about us as a small company is that if you're at a massive tech giant that's a little bit hard for someone who's aligned employee to go and talk to the CEO and say, I think that we're doing this wrong.

Speaker 2:          00:40:10       Um, and you know, you look at companies like Google that have had some collective action from employees to, you know, make, uh, ethical change around things like maven. And so maybe there are mechanisms that are other companies that work. Um, but here super easy for anyone to pull me aside to pull Sam aside to lily aside and people do it all the time. One of the interesting things in the charter is this idea that it'd be great if you could try to describe or untangle switching from competition to collaboration in late stage Agi development. It was really interesting. This dance between competition and collaboration. How do you think about that? Yeah. Assuming that you can actually do the technical side of Agi Development, I think there's going to be two key problems with figuring out how do you actually deploy it, make it go well. The first one of these is the runup to building the first AGI.

Speaker 2:          00:40:56       You look at how self driving cars are being developed and it's a competitive race. And the thing that always happens in competitive race is that you have huge amounts of pressure to get rid of safety. And so that's one thing we're very concerned about, right, is that people, multiple teams figuring out, we can actually get there, but you know, if we took the slower path that is more guaranteed to be safe, we will lose. And so we're going to take the fast path. And so the more that we can both ourselves be in a position where we don't generate that competitive race where we say if the race is being run and that you know, someone else's is further ahead than we are, we're not going to try to, to leap frog, we're going to actually work with them. Right? We will help them succeed.

Speaker 2:          00:41:38       As long as what they're trying to do is to fulfill our mission, then we're good. We don't have to build AGI ourselves. Um, and I think that's a really important commitment from us. But it can't just be you unilateral, right. I think it's really important that other players were serious about building Agi, make similar commitments. Right. And I think that that, again, to the extent that everyone believes that Agi should be something to benefit everyone, then it actually really shouldn't matter which company builds it. And we should all be concerned about the case where we just raced so hard to get there. Then something goes wrong. So what role do you think government, our favorite entity has in setting policy and rules about this domain? From research to the development? To too early stage to late stage AI and Agi development. So I think that first of all, um, is really important that governments in there, right in some way, shape or form.

Speaker 2:          00:42:29       You know, at the end of the day we're talking about Olin technology that will shape how the world operates and that there needs to be government as part of that answer. And so that's why we've, uh, we've, we've done a number of different congressional testimonies. We, uh, interact with a number of different lawmakers. Uh, and, uh, you know, right now a lot of our message to them is that it's not the time for regulation. It is the time for measurement that our main policy recommendation is that people, and you know, the government does this all the time with bodies like nest. Um, spend time trying to figure out just where the technology is, how fast it's moving, and can really become literate and up to speed with respect to what to expect. Um, so I think that today the answer really is about, about, about measurement. Um, and I think that there will be a time and place where that will change.

Speaker 2:          00:43:21       And, uh, I think it's a little bit hard to predict exactly what, what exactly that trajectory should look like. So there will be a point at which regulation federal in the United States the government steps in and helps be the, I don't want to say the adult in the room to make sure that there is strict rules, maybe conservative rules that nobody can cross. Oh, well I think there's, there's kind of maybe two, two angles to it. So today with narrow AI applications that I think there are already existing bodies that are responsible and should be responsible for regulation. You think about it, for example, with self driving cars that you want the, uh, you know, the national highway, I Nitsa exactly. To, to be very good and that, that makes sense, right? The, basically what we're saying is that we're going to have these technological systems that are going to be performing applications that humans already do.

Speaker 2:          00:44:12       Great. We already have ways of thinking about standards and safety for those. Um, so I think it actually empowering those regulators today is also pretty important. And then I think for, for Agi, you know, that there's going to be a point where we'll have better answers. And I think that maybe a similar approach of first measurement and you know, start thinking about what the rules are should be. I think it's really important that we don't prematurely squash, you know, progress. I've got to get very easy to kind of smother the abutting field. And I think that's something to really avoid. But I don't think it's the right way of doing it is to say, let's just try to blaze ahead and not involve all of these other stakeholders. So, uh,

Speaker 1:          00:44:53       you've recently released a paper on a gpt to language modeling, uh, uh, but, uh, did not release the full model because he had concerns about the possible negative effects of the availability of such model. It's a outside of just that decision. It's super interesting because of the discussion as at a societal level, the discourse it creates. So it's fascinating in that aspect. But if you think it's the specifics here at first, what are some negative effects that you envisioned? And of course, what is some of the positive effects?

Speaker 2:          00:45:28       Yeah, so again, I think to zoom out, like the way that we thought about gpt too is that with language modeling, we are clearly on a trajectory right now where we scale up our models and we get qualitatively better performance, right? Gpt to itself was actually just a scale up of a model that we've released in the previous June, right? And we just ran it at a much larger scale and we got these results where if suddenly starting to write coherent pros, uh, which was not something we'd seen previously. And what are we doing now? Well, we're going to scale up GPD two by 10 x by a hundred acts by thousand decks and we don't know what we're going to get. And so it's very clear that the model that we, that we released last June, you know, I think it's kind of like, it's, it's, it's, it's a good academic toy.

Speaker 2:          00:46:16       It's not something that we think is something that can really have negative applications or you know, to the extent that a candidate, the positive of people being able to play with it, uh, is, is you know, far far outweighs the, the possible harms you fast forward to not gpt to but you 20. Okay. And you think about what that's going to be like. And I think that the capabilities are going to be substantive. And so there needs to be a point in between the two where you say, this is something where we are drawing the line and that we need to start thinking about the safety aspects. And I think for GPD too, we could have gone either way. And in fact, when we had conversations internally, uh, that we had a bunch of pros and cons, um, and it wasn't clear which one, which one outweighed the other.

Speaker 2:          00:46:58       Um, and I think that when we announced that, hey, we decided not to release this model, then there was a bunch of conversation where various people said, it's so obvious that you should have just released it. There are other people said it's so obvious you should not have released it. And I think that that almost definitionally means that holding it back was the correct decision, right? If it's con, if there's, if it's not obvious whether something is beneficial or not, you should probably default to caution. And so I think that the, that the, that the overall landscape for how we think about it is that this decision could have gone either way. There's great arguments of both directions, but for future models down the road, um, and possibly sooner than you'd expect because, you know, scaling these things up doesn't have to take that long.

Speaker 2:          00:47:35       Those ones you're definitely not going to want to, to release into the wild. And so, um, I think that we almost view this as a test case and to see can we even design, you know, how do you have a society, how do you have a system that goes from having no concept of responsible disclosure, where the mere idea of not releasing something for safety reasons is unfamiliar to a world where you say, okay, we have a powerful model. Let's at least think about it. Let's go through some process and you think about the security community, it took them a long time to design responsible disclosure, right? You know, you think about this question of, well, I have a security exploit. I sent it to the company. The company is like, tries to prosecute me or just sit, just ignores it. What do I do?

Speaker 2:          00:48:15       Right? And so you know, the alternatives of, Oh, I just just always publish your exploits. That doesn't seem good either. Right? And so it really took a long time and took this, this, uh, it was bigger than any individual, right? It's really about building a whole community that believed that, okay, we'll have this process where you sent it to the company. You know, if they don't act in a certain time, then you can go public and you're not a bad person, you've done the right thing. Um, and I think that in AI, part of the response to GPD to just proves that we don't have any concept of this. Um, so that's the high level picture. Um, and so I think that, I think this was, this was a really important move to make and we could have maybe delayed it for TBT three, but I'm really glad we did it for gpt to, and so now you look at gpt to itself and you think about the substance of okay, what are potential negative applications?

Speaker 2:          00:49:01       So you have this model that's been trained on the Internet, which, you know, it's also going to be a bunch of very biased data. A bunch of, you know, very, uh, offensive content in there. Uh, and a, you can ask it to generate content for you on basically any topic, right? You just give it a prompt and we'll just start and start writing and our rights content like you see on the Internet, you know, even down to like saying advertisement in the middle of, of some of it's generations. And, uh, you think about the possibilities for generating fake news or abusive content. And you know, it's interesting seeing what people have done with uh, you know, we released a smaller version of gpt to, and a that people have done things like try to generate, I take my own Facebook message history and generate more Facebook messages like me.

Speaker 2:          00:49:42       Um, and uh, people generating fake politician I content or I, you know, there, there's a bunch of things there were nice to have to think is this going to be good for the world? There's the flip side, which is I think that there's a lot of awesome applications that we really want to see, like creative applications in terms of if you have saifai authors that can work with this tool and come up with cool ideas like that seems, that seems awesome. If we can write better Saifai through the use of these tools and we've actually had a bunch of people write into us asking, Hey, can we use it for, you know, a variety of different creative applications. The positive, I actually pretty easy to imagine, uh, there if, you know, the, the usual and a applications are really interesting. But let's go there. It's kind of interesting to think about a world where I look at Twitter

Speaker 3:          00:50:36       where that just fake news, but smarter and smarter bots being able to uh, spread in an interesting complex networking way in information that just floods out us regular human beings with our original thoughts. So

Speaker 2:          00:50:54       what are your views of this world will gpt 20, right?

Speaker 3:          00:50:59       What do you, how do we think about it? Again, it's like one of those things about in the fifties trying to describe the, uh, the internet or the smartphone. What do you think about that world, the nature of information? Do we add one possibility is that we'll always try to design systems that identify it, robot versus human, and we'll do so successfully. And so we will authenticate that we're still human. And the other world is that we just accept the, the fact that we're swimming in a sea of fake news and just learn to swim there.

Speaker 2:          00:51:32       Well, have you ever seen the uh, pop popular meme of a, of a robot, uh, with, with a physical, physical arm in pen clicking the I am not a robot button. Yeah. I think, I think that the truth is that that really trying to distinguish between a robot and human is a losing battle. Ultimately you think it's a losing battle. I think it's a losing battle ultimately. Right? I think that that is that in terms of of the content, in terms of the actions that you can take. I mean think about how captures have gone, right. The capture is used to be a very nice, simple, you just have this image. All of our OCR is terrible. You put a couple of of artifacts in it, you know, humans are going to be able to tell what it is an AI system wouldn't be able to today like I can barely do captures.

Speaker 2:          00:52:15       Yeah, and I think that this is just kind of where we're going, I think captures where we're a moment in time thing and as AI system to become more powerful that they're being human capabilities that can be measured in a very easy automated way that the AI's will not be capable of. I think that's just like, it's just an increasingly hard technical battle, but it's not that all hope is lost. Right? And you think about how do we already authenticate ourselves, right? You know, we have systems, we have social security numbers. If you're in the US or you know, you have, you have, uh, you know, ways of identifying individual people and having real world identity tied to digital identities seems like a step towards, you know, authenticating the source of content rather than the content itself. Now there are problems with that. How can you have privacy and anonymity in a world where the only content you can really trust is we're, the only way you can trust content is by looking at where it comes from.

Speaker 2:          00:53:08       Um, and so I think that building up good reputation networks, maybe, maybe one possible solution. But yeah, I think that this, this question is, is not an obvious one. And I think that we, you know, maybe sooner than we think we'll be in a world where, you know, today I often will read a tweet and be like, do I feel like real human wrote this? Or, you know, don't feel like it's just like genuine. I feel like I can kind of judge the content a little bit. Um, and I think in the future it just won't be the case. You look at, for example, the FCC comments on net neutrality, I came out later that millions of those were autogenerated and that the researchers were able to do various statistical tick techniques to do that. What do you do in a world where those statistical techniques don't exist? It's just impossible to tell the difference between humans and AI highs. And in fact, the, uh, the, the, the most persuasive arguments are written by, by Ai, all that stuff. It's not saifai anymore. Okay. Gpt to making a great argument for why recycling is bad for the world. You got to read that, you know, like, Huh. You're right.

Speaker 2:          00:54:06       Yeah. That's, that's quite interesting. I mean, ultimately it boils down to the physical world being the last frontier of proving right.

Speaker 3:          00:54:13       You said like basically networks of people, humans vouching for humans in the physical world and somehow the authentication and ends there. I mean, if I had to ask you,

Speaker 2:          00:54:25       you're way too eloquent for a human. So if I had to ask you to authenticate, like prove, how do I know you're not a robot, how do you know I'm not a robot? I think that's so far we're, we're

Speaker 3:          00:54:39       this in this space, this conversation we just had, the physical movements we did is the biggest gap between us and AI systems as the physical manipulation. So maybe that's the last frontier.

Speaker 2:          00:54:51       Well, here's another question is, is, you know, why, why is, why is solving this problem important, right? Like what aspects are really important to us? I think that probably where we'll end up is we'll hone in on what do we really want out of knowing if we're talking to a human. Um, and, uh, and I think that, again, this comes down to identity. And so I think that that the Internet of the future, I expect to be one that we'll have lots of agents out there, uh, that will interact with you. But I think that the question of is this, you know, flush, real flesh and blood human, or is this an automated system? Uh, may actually just be less important. Let's actually go there. It's gpt to is impressive and that's like a gpt 20. Why is it so bad that all my friends are gpt 20?

Speaker 3:          00:55:39       Why? Why is it so, why is it so important on the intranet do you think, uh, to interact with only human beings? Why can't we live in a world where ideas can come from models trained on human data?

Speaker 2:          00:55:52       Yeah, I think this is, I think this is actually a really interesting question. This comes back to the how do you even picture a world with some new technology, right? And I think that the one thing that I think is important is, is, you know, good say honesty. Um, and I think that if you have, you know, almost in the Turing test style a sense sense of, of, of technology, you have ais that are pretending to be humans and deceiving you. I think that is, you know, that that feels like a bad thing, right? I think that it's really important that we feel like we're in control of our environment, right? That we understand who we're interacting and if it's an AI or a human, um, that, that that's not something that we're being deceived about. But I think that the flip side of can I have as meaningful of an interaction with an AI as I can with the human?

Speaker 2:          00:56:33       Uh, well I actually think here you can turn into Scifi and her I think is a great example of asking this very question, right? One thing I really love about her is it really starts out almost by asking how meaningful our human virtual relationships, right? And, uh, and then you have a human who has a relationship with an AI and, uh, that you really start to be drawn into that, right? And that all of your emotional buttons get triggered in the same way as if there was a real human that was on the other side of that phone. And so I think that this is one way of thinking about it is that I think that we can have meaningful interactions and that if there's a funny joke, some sense it doesn't really matter if it was written by a human or an AI, but what you don't want and away where I think we should really draw hard lines is deception.

Speaker 2:          00:57:17       Um, and I think that as long as we're in a world where, you know, why, why do we build AI systems at all, right? The reason we went to build them is to enhance human lives, to make humans be able to do more things, to have human humans feel more fulfilled. And if we can build AI systems that do that, uh, you know, sign me up. So the process of language modeling, how far do you think it takes us? Let's look a movie her. Do you think, uh, uh, dialogue, natural language conversation is formulated by the Turing test, for example. Do you think that process could be achieved through this kind of unsupervised language modeling? So I think the Turing test in its in its real form isn't just about language, right? It's really about reasoning to write that to really pass the Turing test.

Speaker 2:          00:58:01       I should be able to teach calculus to whoever's on the other side and have it really understand calculus and be able to, you know, go in and solve new calculus problems. And so I think that to really solve the Turing test, we need more than what we're seeing with language models. We need some way of plugging in reasoning now, how different will that be from what we already do? That's an open question, right? It might be that we need some sequence of totally radical new ideas or it might be that we just need to kind of shape our existing systems in a slightly different way. But I think that in terms of how far language model we'll go, it's already gone way further than many people would have expected. Right. I think that things like, and they think there's a lot of really interesting angles to poke in terms of how much does gpt to understand physical world.

Speaker 2:          00:58:47       Like, you know, you, you read a little bit about fire underwater, uh, in, in Gbd too. So it's like, okay, maybe it doesn't quite understand what these things are. But at the same time, I think that you also see various things like smoke coming from flame and you know, a bunch of these things that Gbtq it has no body, it has no physical experience, it's just statically red data. Um, and I think that, I think that if the answer is like, we don't know yet, um, these questions though, we're starting to be able to actually ask them to physical systems that real systems that exist and that's very exciting. Do you think, what's your intuition you think if you just scale

Speaker 1:          00:59:22       language modeling, uh, like, uh, significantly scale that reasoning

Speaker 2:          00:59:28       can emerge from the same exact mechanisms? I think it's unlikely that if we just scale GPD to that will have reasoning in the full fledged way. And I think that there's like, you know, the type signatures a little bit wrong, right? Like there's something we do with that we call thinking, right, where we spend a lot of compute, like a variable amount of compute to get to better answers, right? I think a little bit harder, I get a better answer. And that, that kind of type signature isn't quite encoded in a Gbt, right? Gbt will kind of like, it spent a long time and it's like evolutionary history baking and all this information getting very, very good at this predictive process. And then at runtime I just kind of do one Ford Pass and uh, and, and be able to generate stuff. And so, you know, there might be small tweaks to what we do in order to get the type signature right. For example. Well, you know, it's not really one for had passed. Right. You know, you generate some boy I symbol and so maybe you generate like a whole sequence of, of, of thoughts and you only keep the last bit or something. Right. Um, but I think that at the very least, I would expect you have to make changes like that.

Speaker 1:          01:00:32       Yeah. Yeah. Just exactly how we, you said think is the process of generating thought by thought in the same kind of way. Like you said, keep the last bit the thing that we converge towards. Yup.

Speaker 2:          01:00:44       And I think there's, there's another piece which is, which is interesting, which is this out of distribution generalization, right? And they're like thinking somehow that's, let's do that, right. That we haven't experienced a thing. And yet somehow we just kind of keep refining our mental model of it. Um, this is again, something that feels tied to whatever reasoning is and maybe it's a small tweak to what we do, maybe as many ideas and we'll take as many decades.

Speaker 1:          01:01:08       Yeah. So the, the assumption there, a generalization out of distribution is that it's possible to create new ideas, the Po, you know, as possible that nobody's ever created any new ideas. And then with scaling Gpt to did gpt 20, uh, you would, you would essentially generalize to all possible thoughts I'll, Siemens could have.

Speaker 2:          01:01:32       I think so, just to play devil's advocate here, right? I mean, how many, how many, uh, new, new story ideas have we come up with Shakespeare, right? Yeah, exactly. It's just all different forms of love and drama and so on. Okay. Not sure if you read, but

Speaker 1:          01:01:46       a lesson, a recent blog post by rich Sutton. Yup. I have, he basically says, uh, something that echoes some of the ideas that you've been talking about, which is a, he says the biggest lesson that can be read from so many years of AI research is that general methods that leverage computation are ultimately going to, uh, ultimately went out. Uh, do you agree with this? So basically have an open the in general about ideas that you're exploring about coming up with methods or there's gpt to modeling or whether it's a five

Speaker 3:          01:02:20       playing dota where a general method is better than a more fine tuned expert tuned

Speaker 2:          01:02:28       method. Yeah. So I think that, well, one thing that I think was really interesting about the reaction to that blog post was an audit. People have read this as saying that compute is all that matters. And that's a very threatening idea. Right. And I don't think it's a true idea either. Right? It's very clear that we have algorithmic ideas that have been very important for making progress and to really build AGI. You want to push as far as you can and the computational scale and you want to push as far as you can on human human ingenuity. And so I think you need both. But I think the way that you phrased the question is actually very good, right? That it's really about what kind of ideas should we be striving for. And absolutely, if you can find a scalable idea, pour more computing power, more data into it, it gets better.

Speaker 2:          01:03:11       Like that's, that's the real holy grail. And so I think that, uh, the, the, the answer to the question, and I think it's yes. Um, that, that that's really how we think about it and that part of why we're excited about the power of deep learning, the potential for building Agi is because we look at the systems that exist in the most successful AI systems and we realize that you scale those up, they're going to work better. And I think that that scalability is something that really gives us hope for being able to build transformative systems.

Speaker 3:          01:03:39       So I'll tell you this, it partially and emotional, you know, a thing that response that people often have, this computer is so important for state of the outperformance. You know, individual developers, maybe a 13 year olds sitting somewhere in Kansas or something like that, you know, they're sitting, they might not even have a GPU and or may have a single GPU, a 10 80 or something like that. And there's this feeling like, well, how can I possibly compete or contribute to this world of AI if a scale is so important? So if you can comment on that. And in general, do you think we need to also in the future focus on, uh, democratizing compute resources more, more, or as much as we democratize the algorithms?

Speaker 2:          01:04:22       Well, so the way that I think about it is that there's this space of, of possible progress, right? There's a space of ideas and sort of systems that will work, that will move us forward. And there's a portion of that space. And to some extent, increasingly significant portion of that space that does just require massive compute resources. And for that that I think that the answer is kind of clear that part of why we have the structure that we do is because we think it's really important to you pushing the scale and to be, you know, building these large clusters and systems. But there's another part portion of the space that isn't about the large scale compute that are these ideas that, and again, I think that for the days to really be impactful and really shine, that they should be ideas that if you scale them up would work way better than they do at small scale.

Speaker 2:          01:05:08       Um, but that you can discover them without massive computational resources. And if you look at the history of, of recent developments, you think about things like the Gan or the VAE that these are ones that I think you could come up with them without having. And you know, in practice people did come up with, with them without having massive, massive computational resources. Right. I just talked to Ian Goodfellow. But the thing is the initial Gan produce pretty terrible results, right? So only because it wasn't a very specific, it was only because they're smart enough to know that this is quite surprising him generated anything. Did they know any, do you see a world or is that too optimistic and dream or like to imagine that the compute resources or something that's owned by governments and provided a as utility? Actually, someone sent this, this question reminds me of, of a blog post from one of my former professors at Harvard.

Speaker 2:          01:06:00       It's this guy map, not Welsh, who was assistant professor. I remember sitting in his tenure talk, right? And, uh, you know that he had literally just gotten tenure. You went to Google for the summer. Uh, and uh, I then decided he wasn't going back to academia and that kind of in his blog posts, he makes this point that look as a systems researcher that I come up with these cool system ideas, right? And I kind of belittle a proof of concept. And the best thing I can hope for is that the people at Google or Yahoo, which was around at the time, we'll implement it and actually make it work at scale. That's like the dream for me, right? I built the little thing and they turned into the big thing that's actually working and a for him. He said, I'm done with that. I want to be the person who is, who's actually doing building and deploying.

Speaker 2:          01:06:47       And I think that there's a similar dichotomy here, right? I think that there are people who've really actually find value and I think it is a valuable thing to do to be the person who produces those ideas, right? Who builds the proof of concept and yeah, you don't get to generate the coolest possible gang images, but you invented the gown. Right? Right. And so that there's, there's, there's a real trade off there and I think that that's a very personal choice, but I think there's value in both sides. Did you think, uh, creating AGI something or some new models? Uh, would, we would see echoes of the brilliance even at the prototype level. So you would be able to develop those ideas without scale. The initial sow seeds. Take a look at, you know, I always like to look at examples that exist, right? Look at real precedent.

Speaker 2:          01:07:32       And so take a look at the June, 2018 models that we released, we scaled up to turn into gpt to, and you can see that at small scale, it set some records, right? This was the original gpt. We actually had some, some cool generations. They weren't nearly as as, as amazing and really stunning as the gpt to ones, but it was promising. It was interesting. And so I think it is the case that with a lot of these ideas, do you see promise at small scale? But there isn't an asterisk here, a very big asterisk, which is sometimes we see behaviors that emerge that are qualitatively different from anything we saw at small scale. And that the original inventor of whatever algorithm looks at and says, I didn't think it could do that. Hmm. This is what we saw in Dota, right? So Ppo was, was created by John Coleman, who's a researcher here.

Speaker 2:          01:08:20       And, uh, and with, with Dota, we basically just ran PPO at massive, massive scale. And, uh, you know, there's some tweaks in the north star in order to make it work, but fundamentally it's PPO with the core. And we were able to get this longterm planning these, these behaviors to really play out on a timescale that we just thought was not possible. Um, and John looked at that and it was like, I didn't think it could do that. That's what happens when you're at three orders of magnitude more scale than tested at. Yeah. But it still has the same flavors of, uh, you know, uh, and these echoes of the expected billions, uh, although I suspect with gpt is scaled more and more, you might get surprising things. Uh, so yeah. Yeah, you're right. It's, it's interesting that it's, it is difficult to see how far an idea we'll go when it's scaled.

Speaker 2:          01:09:09       It's an open question. Well, so to that point with, with Dota and PPO, look, I mean, here's, here's a very concrete one, right? It's like, um, it's actually one thing that's very surprising about Dota that I think people don't really pay that much attention to is the decree of generalization out of distribution that happens, right? That you have this AI that's trained against other bots for its entirety. The entirety of its existence is, sorry to take a step back. Can you, can you tell, talk through is, you know, a story of Dota, uh, story of uh, leading up to opening I five and a that passed and what was the process of self plan? So a lot of training on what is Dota Dota, it's a complex video game. And we started training, we started trying to solve Dota because we felt like this was a step towards the real world relative to other games like chess or go write those very Sri Board Games where you just kind of have this board of very discreet moves.

Speaker 2:          01:10:01       Dota starts to be much more continuous time that you have this huge variety of different actions that you have a 45 minute game with all these different units. And, uh, it's got a lot of messiness to it that really hasn't been captured by previous games. And famously all of the hard coated bots for Dota were terrible, right? It's just impossible to write anything good for it because it's so complex. And so this seemed like a really good place to push. What's the state of the art in reinforcement learning? And so we started by focusing on the one versus one version of the game and uh, and, and we're able to solve that. We able to beat the world champions and that the, the, the, the learning, the skill curve was this crazy exponential, right? And it was like constantly we were just scaling up that we were fixing bugs and you know, that you look at the, at the skill curve and it was really very, very smooth one.

Speaker 2:          01:10:46       And so it's actually really interesting to see how that like human iteration loop yielded very steady exponential progress. And a two one, one side note. First of all, it's an exceptionally popular video game. The side effect is that there's a lot of incredible human experts at that video. Again, so the benchmark they are trying to reach is very high. And the other, can you talk about the approach that was used initially and throughout training these agents to play this game? And so the approach that we used, his self pay and so you have two agents that don't know anything. They battle each other, they discover something a little bit good and now they both know it and they just get better and better and better without bound. And that's a really powerful idea, right? That we then went from the one versus one version of the game and scaled up to for five versus five, right?

Speaker 2:          01:11:32       So you think about kind of like with basketball where you have this like team and you, I need to do all this coordination and we're able to push the same idea, the same self play, uh, to, to, to, to really get to the professional level at the full five versus five version of the game. And, uh, and, and, and the things I think are really interesting here is that these agents in some ways, they're almost like an insect like intelligence, right? Where they have a lot in common with how an insect is trained, right. Insect kind of lives in this environment for a very long time. Or you know, the, the ancestors of this insect have been around for a long time and had a lot of experience. It gets baked into, into, into this agent. And you know, it's not really smart in the sense of a human right.

Speaker 2:          01:12:12       It's not able to go in and learn calculus, but able to navigate it's environment extremely well and is able to handle unexpected things in the environment that's never seen before pretty well. Um, and we see the same sort of thing with our dough to bots, right? That they're able to, within this game, they're able to play against humans, which is something that never existed in its evolutionary environment. Totally different play styles from humans versus bots. And yet it's able to handle it extremely well. And that's something that I think was very surprising to us with something that doesn't really emerge from what we've seen with PPO at smaller scale or in the kind of scale we running this stuff out was uh, you know, I could take 100,000 CPU cores running with like hundreds of Gpu. Yes. Uh, it was probably about, uh, you know, like something like hundreds of of years of experience going into this bought every single real day. And so that scale is massive and we start to see very different kinds of behaviors out of the algorithms that we all know. And love.

Speaker 1:          01:13:10       Dora you mentioned beat the world expert One v One, and then, uh, we, you, uh, didn't, weren't able to win five, the five this year at the, at the best players in the world. Uh, so what's, what's the comeback story? What's, first of all I'll talk through that does exceptionally exciting event and uh, what's, what's the, the following months and this year look like? Yeah, yeah.

Speaker 2:          01:13:34       One thing that's interesting is that, uh, you know, we lose all the time. All right. So the DOTA team at open the eye, we w we played against better players than our system all the time, or at least we used to write like, you know, the, the, the, the first time we lost publicly was we went up on stage at the international and we played against some of the best teams in the world. Um, and we ended up losing both games, but we give them a run for their money, right? The both games were kind of 30 minutes, 25 minutes, and they went back and forth, back and forth, back and forth. And so I think that really shows that we're at the professional level. Um, and that kind of looking at those games, we think that the coin could have gone a different direction and we could of could of had some wins and thought that was actually very encouraging for us.

Speaker 2:          01:14:16       Um, and you know, it's interesting because the international, was that a fixed time? All right. So we, we knew exactly what day we were going to be playing and we pushed as far as we could, as fast as we could. Yeah. Two weeks later, we had a bot that had an 80% win rate versus the one that played at Tci. Um, so the march of progress, uh, you know, that you should think of it as a snapshot rather than as an end state. Um, and so in fact, we'll, we'll be announcing our, uh, our, our finals pretty soon. I actually think that, uh, we'll announce our final match. I, prior to this podcast being released. So there should be, uh, we'll be playing. Well, you're playing against the world champions and you know, for us it's really less about like the, the way that we think about what's upcoming is the final milestone, the file competitive milestone for the project, right.

Speaker 2:          01:15:00       That our goal in all of this isn't really about beating humans at Dota. Our goal is to push the state of the art in reinforcement learning. And we've done that, right? And we've actually learned a lot from our system and that we have, I, you know, I think a lot of exciting next steps that we want to take. And so, you know, of the final showcase of what we built, we're going to do this match. Um, but for us it's not really the success or failure, um, to see, you know, do, do, do, do we have the coin flip go in our direction or against [inaudible]

Speaker 1:          01:15:25       where do you see the field of deep learning heading in the next few years? Uh, where do you see the work in reinforcement learning, perhaps hiding and uh, more specifically with open AI, all the exciting projects that you're working on. What is 2019? Hold for you? Massive scale scale. I will put an asterisk on that and just say, you know, I think that it's about ideas plus scale. You need both. So that's a really good point. So the question in terms of ideas, you have a lot of projects that are exploring different areas of intelligence. And a, the question is, when you, when you think of scale, do you think about growing scale, those individual projects or do you think about adding new projects and uh, sorry if you were thinking of adding new projects or if you look at the past, what's the process of coming up with new projects, new ideas? Yup.

Speaker 2:          01:16:22       Uh, so we really have a life cycle of project here. Uh, so we start with a few people just working on a small scale idea and language is actually a very good example of this. That it was really, you know, one person here who was pushing on language for a long time. I mean, then you get signs of life, right? And so this is like, let's say a, you know, with, with the original gpt, we had something that was interesting and we said, okay, it's time to scale this, right? It's time to put more people on it, put more computational resources behind it. And uh, and then we just kind of keep pushing and keep pushing. And the end state is something that looks like Dota or robotics where you have a large team of, you know, 10 or 15 people that are running things at very large scale and that you're able to really have material engineering, uh, and, and, uh, and, and you know, sort of machine learning science coming together to make systems that work and get material results that just would have been impossible otherwise.

Speaker 2:          01:17:12       Um, so we do that whole lifecycle. We've done it a number of times, uh, you know, typically end to end. It's probably two, uh, two years or so, a to do it. I, you know, if the organization's been around for three years, so maybe we'll find that we also have longer life cycle projects. Um, but you know, we, we uh, uh, we'll work up to those. We have, uh, so, so one, one team that we were actually just starting Ilien and I are kicking off a new team called the reasoning team and that this is to really try to tackle how do you get neural networks to reason and, uh, we think that this will be a long term project. It's one that we're very excited about. Uh, in terms of reasoning, super exciting topic. What do you, what kind of benchmarks, uh, what kind of tests of reasoning do you envision?

Speaker 2:          01:17:55       What would, if you set back with whatever drink and you will be impressed that this system is able to do something, what would that look like? Are improving, they are improving. So some kind of logic and especially in mathematical logic. I think so. Right. And I think that there's, there's, there's kind of other problems that are dual to theorem improving in particular. Um, you know, you think about, uh, programming, I think about even like security analysis of, of code that these all kind of capture the same sorts of core reasoning and, and being able to do some out of distribution generalization,

Speaker 3:          01:18:29       it would be quite exciting if open AI reasoning team was able to prove that p equals NP. That'd be very nice.

Speaker 2:          01:18:35       Uh, it'd be very, very, very exciting, especially if it turns out the people's NP. That'll be interesting to maybe, uh, it just, it would be a ironic and humorous. Yup. Uh, so what problem

Speaker 3:          01:18:49       stands out to you as, uh, the most, uh, exciting and challenging, impactful to the work for us as a community in general and for open AI and this year you mentioned reasoning. I think that's, that's a heck of a problem.

Speaker 2:          01:19:01       Yeah. So I think reasoning, it's an important one. I think it's going to be hard to get good results in 2019. Um, you know, again, just like we think about the life cycle, it takes time. Um, I think for 2019 language model that seems to be kind of on that ramp, right? It's at the point that we have a technique that works. We want to scale a hundred x thousand x, see what happens. Awesome. Do you think we're living in a simulation? Uh, I think it's, I think it's hard to have a, a real opinion about it. I, you know, it's actually interesting, I separate out things that I think can have like yield materially different predictions about the world from ones that are just kind of fun, fun to speculate about. And I kind of view simulation. It's more like, is there a flying teapot between Mars and Jupiter? Like maybe, but it's a little bit hard to know what that would mean for my life. So there is some something

Speaker 3:          01:19:45       actionable. So some of the best work opening has done is in the field of reinforcement learning and some of the success of reinforcement learning come from being able to simulate the problem you try to solve. So it, do you have a hope for reinforcement for the future of reinforcement learning and for the future of simulation, like whether it's, we're talking

Speaker 1:          01:20:08       about autonomous vehicles or any kind of system, do you see that scaling to where we'll be able to simulate systems and, and hence be able to create a simulator that echoes our real world and uh, proving once and for all, even though you're denying it, that we're living in a simulation.

Speaker 2:          01:20:25       Two separate questions, right? So, you know, kind of, kind of with the core there of like, can we use simulation for self driving cars? Uh, take a look at our robotic system dactyl right. That was trained in simulation using the DOTA system in fact, and it transfers to a physical robot. And I think everyone looks at our dota system, they're like, okay, it's just a game. How are you ever going to escape to the real world? And the answer as well. We did it with a physical robot that no one can program. And so I think the answer is simulation goes a lot further than you think. If you apply the right techniques to it. Now there's a question of, you know, are the beings in that simulation can not gonna wake up and have consciousness. Um, I think that one seems a lot, lot harder to, to again, reason about, I think that, you know, you really should think about like, we're, we're exactly just human consciousness come from in our own self awareness. And you know, is it just that like once you have like a complicated enough neural net, you have to worry about the agents feeling pain. Um, and uh, you know, I think there's like interesting speculation to do there, but uh, but you know, again, I think it's, it's a little bit hard to know for sure.

Speaker 1:          01:21:23       Well, let me just keep with the speculation. Do you think, uh, to create intelligence, general intelligence, you need one consciousness and to a body, do you think any of those elements are needed or as intelligence, something that's that sort of fog and all to those?

Speaker 2:          01:21:38       I'll stick to the, the kind of like the, the, the non grand answer first, right? So the non grand answer is just to look at, you know, what are we already making work? You'll get GPD too. A lot of people would have said that to even get these kinds of results, you need real world experience. You need a body unique grounding. How are you supposed to reason about any of these things? How are you supposed to like even kind of know about smoke and fire and those things if you've never experienced them. And GPD two shows that you can actually go way further than that kind of reasoning would predict. So I think that the, in terms of do we need consciousness, do we need a body? It seems the answer is probably not right. That we could probably just continue to push kind of the systems we have.

Speaker 2:          01:22:16       They already feel general, um, they're not as competent or as general or able to learn as quickly as an AGI would, but you know, there are at least like kind of Prodo Agi in some way and they don't need any of those things. Now, now let's move to the grand answer, which is, you know, if our, our neural nets, nets conscious already, would we ever know, how can we tell right here? Here's where the speculation starts to become, become, you know, at least interesting or fun and maybe a little bit disturbing it depending on where you take it. But it certainly seems that when we think about animals, that there's some continuum of, of, of consciousness. You know, my cat I think is, uh, is conscious in some way, right? I, you know, not as conscious as a human. And you could imagine that you could build a little consciousness meter, right?

Speaker 2:          01:23:01       You pointed a cat, it gives you a little reading, putting out a human. Again, it gives you much bigger reading. What would happen if he appointed one of those at a doughnut neural net? And if you're training in this massive simulation, do the neural nets feel pain? You know, it becomes pretty hard to know that the answer is no and it becomes pretty hard too to really think about what that would mean if the answer were yes. And it's very possible, you know, for example, you could imagine that maybe the reason that humans are have consciousness is because it's a, it's a convenient computational shortcut, right? If you think about it, if you have a being that wants to avoid pain, which seems pretty important to survive in this environment, um, and wants to like, you know, eat food, um, then that maybe the best way of doing it is to have it being of it's conscious, right? That, you know, in order to succeed in the environment, you need to have those properties and how he's supposed to implement them. And maybe this, this consciousness is way of doing that. If that's true, then actually maybe we should expect that really competent reinforcement learning agents. We'll also have consciousness, but you know, it's a big enough and I think there are a lot of other arguments that can make another directions. And

Speaker 1:          01:24:07       I think that's a really interesting idea that even gpt to has some degree of consciousness and it's something, uh, is actually not as crazy to think of all it's useful to think about as we think about what it means to create intelligence of a dog intelligence of a cat and the intelligence of human. So last question. Do you think

Speaker 2:          01:24:27       we will

Speaker 1:          01:24:29       or fall in love like in the movie her with an artificial intelligence system or an artificial intelligence system falling in love with a human?

Speaker 2:          01:24:38       I hope so. If there's any better way to end it is on a love. So, Greg, thanks so much for talking today. Thank you for having me.
