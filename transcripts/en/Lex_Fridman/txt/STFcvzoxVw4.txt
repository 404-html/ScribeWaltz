Speaker 1:          00:00          The following is a conversation with Vladimir of apnic. He's the inventor of the support vector machines, support vector clustering, vc theory and many foundational ideas and statistical learning is born in the Soviet Union and worked at the Institute of Control Sciences and Moscow. Then in the United States. He worked at a and t and e Silabs facebook research and now as a professor at Columbia University. His work has been cited over 170,000 times. He has some very interesting ideas about artificial intelligence and the nature of learning, especially on limits of our current approaches and the open problems in the field. This conversation is part of mit course on artificial general intelligence and artificial intelligence podcasts.

Friedman, spelled F, R I, D, and now. Here's my conversation with Latimer vap. Nick Einstein famously said that God doesn't play dice. You're. You have studied the world through the eyes of statistics, so let me ask you, in terms of the nature of reality, fundamental nature of reality, does God play dice?

Speaker 2:          01:21          You don't know some fuck, that's your course. You don't know some doctors which could be important. It looks like a good way, nice, but we don't discourage it. If you must distinguish between two positions, positions of instrument, where you're creating, it will production in positional for areas where you're trying to understand what God did,

Speaker 1:          01:54          can you describe instrumental and realism a little bit?

Speaker 2:          01:58          For example, if you have some, because Nicole laws work is that is it low each through always and everywhere or it is law which allow you to predict. Position of moving element is what you believe. You believe that it is God's law. God created the world which are the two, this physical law or it is just low for predictions and which one is instrumental? Asm for predictions, this is law of God. It isn't always true everywhere. That means you're the artist so you're trying to.

Speaker 1:          02:52          I'm distant, understands. Got Salt. Say the way you see the world is as an instrumentalist,

Speaker 1:          03:00          you know, are working for someone else, model of machine learning. So in Zeus model you can see a second, the soul is the second assault is a problem and you can do in two different way from the point of view of instrumentalists and that's what everybody does, not because, uh, this is a goal of machine learning is a find zero for clarification, is that the bucket is instrument for production, but they can say Zygote of a machine learning is to learn about conditional probability. So I have got played use in play. What your probability for one, what is a given situation. But for production, I don't need this. I need zero, but for understanding I need conditioner. So let me just step back a little bit. First to talk about, you mentioned, which I read last night, the parts of the 1960 paper by a eugene, a wagner, a unreasonable effectiveness of mathematics and natural sciences because you're such a beautiful paper by the way. You made me feel it to be honest, to confess my own work in the past few years on deep learning, heavily applied, made me feel that I was missing out on some of the beauty of nature in the way that math can uncover. So let me just step away from the poacher that for a second. How do you see the role of math in your life as it? Is it a tool as a poetry where where does it sit and does math for you? Have limits of what it can describe

Speaker 2:          05:01          some people singing each user growth, so I believe

Speaker 1:          05:10          and that to God or use God used God.

Speaker 2:          05:14          Yeah, so I believe the zoo's article about effectiveness, unreasonable effectiveness of mass is that if you're looking for in which a magical structures, so ignore something Kubota and scientists from natural science zero looking on equation in trying to understand sort of the same in machine learning. If you really cared, if we look on all the equations, did you define conditional probability? You can understand something in both the reality, more zen from your fantasy.

Speaker 1:          06:08          So math can reveal the simple underlying principles of reality. Perhaps

Speaker 2:          06:13          you know what mean simple, it is very hard to disclose, but then when you discover them and look at them, you see a beautiful that are in it. The surprising white people did not choose that before you're looking equation derived from equations. For example, I talked to yesterday about Netapp and people had a lot of fantasy improve, coordinate, but if you look going step by step by solving some equations, you're suddenly, you get some term which of the sinking your stands in describe position of observation point wrote a lot of information. You don't look in composition of points of observations. We're looking commonly on residuals, but when your understood that, that's a very simple idea but not too simple to understand. And you can derive this just for mcorigins.

Speaker 1:          07:25          So some simple Algebra, a few steps or take you to something surprising that when you think about

Speaker 2:          07:33          so am that is proof that human intuition not to reach in very primitive and it does not see where it says simple situations. So,

Speaker 1:          07:49          oh, let me take a step back in general. Yes, right. Uh, but what about human as opposed to intuition, ingenuity, um, moments of brilliance. So I use. So, uh, do you have to be so hard on human intuition? Are there moments of brilliance and human intuition that can leap ahead of math and then the math will catch up?

Speaker 2:          08:17          I don't think so. I assume the best human intuition it is putting in Oxford homes and technical where see where they axioms take you, but if they take actions but it ducks your Polish during generation or scientist, and this is integral,

Speaker 1:          08:45          so that's beautifully put. But if you maybe look at when you, when you think of Einstein and special, well, what is the role of imagination coming first there in the moment of discovery of an idea. So there's obviously a mix of math and out of the box imagination there

Speaker 2:          09:10          that's a good goal or exclude you because whatever is so emotional learning conference nation like futures, like the deeper nick looked at it, what was a problem when you're looking vertically from Maki, magical liquidations, you did arrive, been converted. Simple story usually goes fall by God. It's good. Then whatever people can imagine because it is not good frontage, it is just interpretation is just fun things, but it is not what you need. You don't need any imagination to derive a say. My principal of machine learning.

Speaker 1:          09:59          When you think about learning and intelligence, maybe thinking about the human brain and trying to describe mathematically the process of learning, uh, that is something like what happens in the human brain. Do you think we have the tools currently? Do you think we'll ever have the tools to try to describe that process of learning?

Speaker 2:          10:21          You descriptions was growing up. It was interpretation. It is your interpretation. Your vision can be wrong. You know, when God microscope living book for the first time just instrument and nobody will. He kept secret about microscope, but he wrote reports in London sites and excuse the report. When he looked and goes a blood heel. Look, every barrels of water owns or blood on him, but he described blood like fight between you and king. So he saw blood cells, red cells and modules that is mute, I think chose it. And before his interpretation of litigation, and she sent it yesterday in no signs and they are very creative for your look because they believes that he's right. He's right. You saw something, yes, but keep going from interpretation and they believe the same can happen. His brain, what is the most important. But you know, I believe in human language, in some product is so much this. For example, people say that it is better than thousand days of diligence studies one day this great. But if I ask you what did you does? Nobody knows and that this intelligence and but we know from Houston and now from, from, in machine learning is that teachers can do a lot.

Speaker 1:          12:12          So what from a mathematical point of view is the great teacher.

Speaker 2:          12:16          I don't know. That's not, not what have. You can see what teachers can do. You can introduce some, uh, some medicate for creating convergence. Have you doing, I dunno because teacher nor seriality and can describe from this reality predicate in variance. But he knows that when you're using convenient you can decrease the number of observations hundred times. That's

Speaker 1:          12:49          so, but uh, maybe try to pull that apart a little bit. I think you mentioned a, like a piano teacher saying, uh, uh, to the student play like a butterfly and I played piano. I play guitar for a long time and it, yeah, that's theirs. Maybe it's romantic, poetic, but it feels like there's a lot of truth in that statement. Like there is a lot of instruction to that statement and so can you pull that apart? What is, what, what is that? The language itself may not contains information. Okay.

Speaker 2:          13:22          Blah, Blah Blah because blah, blah blah. Yeah. It's what if you, if you blank.

Speaker 1:          13:29          Yes it does, but what? It's not the lane. It's if it feels like a, um, what is the information being exchanged and error? What is the nature of information? What is the representation of that information?

Speaker 2:          13:41          I believe sort of educated, but I don't know exactly what work intelligence and machine learning should be. Yes. Because this is just what you might call a. What was discovered recently is that there is offloading one called stone convergence mechanism and conversions. Macanese before people use only one. If you can go just because using you can use educate, that's what plainly bought the land and if you immediately affect your plan, you'll also see soon as English program. Great. It looks like the dark sleeves like the dark and walk like a duck then it is probably duck. Yes. But this is exact. Put indicates. Looks like a duck. What it means. So you, so many dogs that you're training data. So you're, you have description or hub looks. Integral looks ducks.

Speaker 1:          14:56          Yeah. The visual characteristics of yard.

Speaker 2:          14:59          Yeah. But you won't. And you'll have modeled for, you know, so you would like show that theoretical description for more. The core site is empirical description each year. So on. So about looks like the it general. But what about, seems like a doc. You should know the dogs names. You can say it. Play chess like a duck. Okay. Doug doesn't relate. Yes. And it is completely legal. Educate, but it is useless. So how teachers can recognize not useless. So up to now you don't use this in existing machine a lot and you have data but English forever use. It looks like a duck. Seems like a duck and quacks collecting that

Speaker 1:          15:59          so you can't deny the fact that swims like a duck and quacks like a duck, has humor in it, has an ambiguity.

Speaker 2:          16:08          Let's talk about sitting duck in. It doesn't say jumps, jumping duck. Why? Because

Speaker 1:          16:18          it's not relevant,

Speaker 2:          16:20          but music, you know, dogs, you know, different doors you know, and your mouth and you derive from it is really want to say, say like in jail.

Speaker 1:          16:32          So underneath, in order for us to understand swims like a duck, it feels like we need to know millions of other little pieces of information we pick up along the way. You don't think so that doesn't need to be. This knowledge base in those statements carries some rich information that helps us understand the essence of duck. Yeah. How far are we from integrating a product gets,

Speaker 2:          17:02          you know, when, when you consider complete sewer machine. So what does you have? A lot of functions. And then you're, you're, you're talking, it looks like a duck. You see your three new data from training data. You recognize his life. Uh, expected dark should look all functions did, you, does not look like you think it should look from staining it. So you could use a multifunction from vhp pickup, what you a second predicate and they pay this could decrease the second function enough to that. You a function, you can find it. Just stunned that machine learning. So why are you need not too many examples

Speaker 1:          18:03          is your products aren't very good,

Speaker 2:          18:06          Mrs. Yeah, because every political is invented to decrease it leaseable set of function.

Speaker 1:          18:17          So you talk about admissible set of functions. Can you talk about good functions? So what makes a good function?

Speaker 2:          18:24          So admissible set of function is circle function. You chose small capacity of small diversity. She did mention except did you continue to good function, etc.

Speaker 1:          18:36          So by the way, for people who don't know, vc, you're the v in the vc. Uh, uh. So, uh, how would you describe to a lay person? What vc theories, uh, how would you describe these?

Speaker 2:          18:51          We're mushroom, so machine capable to pick up one function from zed miscible, settler reflection. But certified miserables function can be contained. All continuous functions in useless. you don't have so many examples to pick up watch, but it can be small, small, uh, because capacity, but maybe better diversity, so not very different function in the function but not very diverse. So if it's small, you shouldn't mention when you mentioned a small union, you union smaller moment of training data sources. The goal is to create admissible set of functions. Ditch is small vishy dimension and contained good zoom. You should use it. You'll be able to pick up the function using a small amount of sort of

Speaker 1:          20:02          is that, that is the task of learning is creating a set of admissible functions as a small vc dimension. And then you've figured out a clever way of picking up

Speaker 2:          20:17          the is that this goal of learning which a fully formulated yesterday? Yep. Statistical learning surgery does not involved in creating admissible set. The function in classical learning surgery everywhere. Hundred percent in textbook is a set of function. Admissible central function is given, but this is both nothing because the most difficult problem to create admissible setup functions given see a lot of functions continuum set up, auction create admissible central functions. That's been the key is finding it to be small and contained good function. So this was out of consideration.

Speaker 1:          21:05          So what's the process of doing that? I mean, it's fascinating. What is the process of creating this, um, admissible set of functions that's in various. can you describe the variance

Speaker 2:          21:18          of appropriate use of data in a proper just means is that you have some function in your, you're just cold. What does your aVerage, your function on your kind of model in what is the expectation of this function on some, on set so that the problem was bold. HaVe to piCk up functions. It can be in yoU. Fuck you, fuck you for all functions. But because when talking, see doug does not jumping so you don't ask questions, jump like a duck because if this three really doesn't the junk and from doesn't help you mature nor something vg task you're asking for you like figure it like a duck but looks like a duck. It haS general looks like see go. Who covers his illness? Is this disease? It says legal. Yeah. So there is a general type of political groups like in specific special nikki, which he related to this specific and his intelligence, but also business and that were teachers involved.

Speaker 1:          22:56          Incorporating the specialized predicates a. Okay. What do you think about deep learning as a neural networks, these arbitrary architectures as helping accomplish some of the tasks you're thinking about their effectiveness or lack thereof? what are, what are the weaknesses and what are the possible strengths?

Speaker 2:          23:20          No, this is fun. Everybody seems huge. Deep learning like futures. Let me give you this example. One of the greatest book is churchill book about history of second world war and he starting this book, describing that in old time when the war is over, so the great kings together, almost all of them were relatives and they discuss what should be done, have to create peace and they came to an agreement in what happens for the general public came in, bought in. They were so good that rope Germany and it was clear for everybody that it is not peace that peaceful last only 20 years because they was not professionals in the same way. She in machine learning zarama, zara mathematicians, we're looking for the problem from a very deep point of your magical point and zara computer scientists, there's mostly does not know market is.

Speaker 2:          24:46          They just have interpretation of that and they invented a lot of blablabla interpretations like deep learning, deep learning does not know. Deploying which you might have, does not know a neurons. It is just function if you like to say piecewise linear function, say that and do it in class of piecewise linear function, but they went something and then they try to to to proof advantage of that through interpretations which mostly wrong and again they appeal to brain which they know nothing about that nobody knows what god can break, so I think that more reliable woke en masse. There's as much scope problem or do your best to solve this problem. Try to understand that there is no only one way of convergence which is strong wave of euphoria of conductors which requires predicate. If you will go through all this stuff, you will see that you don't need even more. I was one of the tour him. Each color presented theory. It says that optimal solution of logical problem, which is, would you describe lord ngukurr, his own shuttle network, not on deep learning and a shower. Again,

Speaker 1:          26:23          problem is there. Absolutely. So in the end, what you're saying is exactly right. The question is, you have no value for throwing something on the table playing with it, not math. So like in your network or you said throwing something in the bucket and our, um, by the biological example in looking at kings and queens with the cells, with a microscope you don't see value in imagining the cells are kings and queens. And using that as inspiration and imagination for where the math will eventually lead you. You think that interpretation, who was basically deceives you in a way that's not productive

Speaker 2:          27:06          are soon. If you're on the laws of nature, of a spiritually discussion about deploying it was discussion about interpretation. Not the boat sinks your boat. What you can say about sings.

Speaker 1:          27:26          That's right. But aren't you surprised by the beauty of it? So the, the, the, uh, not mathematical beauty, but the fact that it Works at all, or are you criticizing that very beauty? Our human desire to, to interpret, to find our silly, silly interpretations and these constructs like, let me ask you this, are you surprised in that? Does it inspire you or how do you feel about the success of a system like alphago beating the game of go using neural networks to estimate the quality of a board of a board and the quality of the interpretation coordinator support? Yeah. Yes. So it's not our interpretation. The fact is, and you're on our system, doesn't matter. A learning system that we don't. I think mathematically understand that well beat the best human player does something that was,

Speaker 2:          28:32          it's not very difficult.

Speaker 1:          28:34          That's so you empiric. we've empirically have discovered that this is not a very difficult problem. It's true. Uh, so maybe can't argue. Uh, so

Speaker 2:          28:50          you would more obviously the user uses the polluting. It is not the most effective way of learning theory and usually when people use the learning using zillions of training data, but you don't need this. So I guess challenge generally do some problems. Did you do real deep learning method? You are using contract terms lists even more. Some problems deploying cannot solve because it's not necessarily z create admissible set of function. When creek

Speaker 3:          29:42          deep architecture muesli created miscible set of functions, you cannot say that you create in good, admissible setup, you're just a ceo fantasy. It does not come from us, but it is possible to create ugly stubble set of functions and because you have a training data that the actually for magicians, a run, you're considering warrior, you need to use law of large numbers when you making training in existing algorithm, uniform law of large numbers, which is much more difficult to acquire. So we said imagine and all that stuff, but never the less. If you use morse code stroke way of convergence, you can decrease a lot of training data.

Speaker 1:          30:34          Yeah, you could do the three. This one was like a duck, quacks like a duck, but are. So let's, let's, let's step back and think about intel. Human intelligence in general. Clearly that has evolved in a non mathematical way. It wasn't, uh, as far as we know, uh, god, uh, or, or, or whoever didn't come up with a model in place in our brain of admissible functions. It kind of evolved. I don't know, maybe you have a view on this, but. So alan turing in the fifties, in his paper, I'm asked and rejected the question, can machines think it's not a very useful question, but can you briefly entertain this useful, useless question. Can machines think? So talk about intelligence and your vieW of it.

Speaker 3:          31:28          I don't know. Hearing, describe imitation computer can imitate human being. Let's call it intelligent and he understands that it is not sinking computer. Yes. He completely understand what he does, but he's set up problem of imitation so long. He understands that the problem, not in limitation. I'm not sure that intelligence just inside of us. It might be all soft side of us. I have several observations. So when they approved some sodium, difficult, sorry, a couple of years in several places, people pull off the same sorta loma after ours was done in other guys in the history of science. It's happened all the time. For example, john certain similar foster did a little and goals and [inaudible] and another guy in the approximately in 10 times video taped up the spirit of time. If they saw a lot of examples like that in which my tuition wednesday develop something big sampson, congenital ditch effect everybody. So maybe you're our models. It intelligence only inside the foss is incorrect. It's our interpretation. Yeah. It might be some connection. You wold intelligence, I don't know. You're almost like plugging in into a. Yeah, exactly. And contributing to this network to a big maybe in your own network.

Speaker 3:          33:28          And the flip side of that, maybe you can comment on a big old complexity in how you see classifying algorithms by worst case, running time in relation to their input. So that way of thinking about functions. Do you think p equals np? Do you think? That's an interesting question. It was interesting coalition, but let me talk about complexity. In the worst case scenario, zoos in which you might circle setting when they came to the United States in 1990, so people did not know this show is I get not no statistical lot. So in Russia it was published two motocross. Oh, one more grass, but in America said that no zinzi lord, and somebody told me the worst case scenario, create three. Okay, so what do it not, because it is much in what's called tool. You can do only what you can do using the markings and ditch [inaudible] a clear understanding and clear description and for some reason the introduce complexity and didn't he just because using. Actually it is diverse like this one more dimension. You can pro sodiums, but we also create order for case when you low probability to measure is that the best case which can happen at the same therapy. Stability. So from which you might scope point of view, you know the best possible case is the worst possible case. You can have different model in medium but not so interesting. You think that the edges are interesting and yeah, just because

Speaker 3:          35:38          it is not so easy to get

Speaker 1:          35:42          good bob, exact boat. It's not my crisis or where you up, but interesting principles. Did you discover the moss? Do you think it's interesting because it's challenging and reveals interesting principles that allow you to get those bounds? Or do you think it's interesting because it's actually very useful for understanding the essence of a function of a, of an algorithm. So it's like me judging your life as a human Being by the worst thing he did in the best thing he did versus all the stuff in the middle. It seems a not productive

Speaker 3:          36:25          are those things. So because you can not describe the situation in the middle or not general. So you can describe it just, and it is clear because some model, but you cannot describe model for every new case. So you're, you'll be nervous when you're using

Speaker 1:          36:52          mortal. But from a statistical point of view, the way you've studied, uh, functions and, and the nature of learning in the world, don't you think that the real world has a very long tail, that the edge cases are very far away from the mean the stuff in the middle or. No,

Speaker 3:          37:20          because as soon as you, which from my point of view, if you use formal statistic, you uniform wolf lodge, if you will use, is this in avoidance business, you've just flushed homeless. You don't have this huge difference between uniform law.

Speaker 1:          37:56          Is it useful to describe that a little more or it will show we just take it to,

Speaker 3:          38:01          for example, when, when talking about doc I give city pretty dedicated enough. but if you try to distinguish, you didn't need a lot of observing.

Speaker 1:          38:17          Uh,

Speaker 3:          38:18          and so does that means, is that information? It looks like a duck contained a lot of information form of bits of information. So if you don't know thAt,

Speaker 1:          38:32          how much bit of information

Speaker 3:          38:36          sinks from artificial intelligence is that, does this album, you know, old business are. I don't like cuff people and she the artificial intelligence is consider us some quotes which imitate activity or human being. It is not science, which is applications you would like to imitate. Go heretic is very useful. It was problem, but

Speaker 3:          39:11          junior to to to lord substance more have people try to do cricket. People came to see a pretty face, so you just like a dock or play like butterfly or something like that. The teacher says you have it came in his mind how he chooses. So that process is problem of intelligence. That is the problem of intel and you see that connected to the problem of learning options are they requested you immediately gives us predicate like a specific predicate streams, like a dark hole. You just choose it somehow. So what is the line of work would you say? If you were to formulate it as a set of open problems that will take us there, will play. Look, a butterfly will get a system to be able to look at two stories, one story, the predicate. You can do something. Then those stories have to get predicate. It is intelligence problem and people even did not start the understanding because to understand intelligence, the full try to understand what do teachers of teacher teach via one teacher butlers in another one. Yup. And so you, you think we're really even haven't started on the journey of regenerating the protocols. You don't understand. You don't understand this problem exist

Speaker 3:          40:56          because did you, do you know, are you just normal name and I won't understand a why one tissue, but in a teacher student, not because he repeating zipparo boom, which isn't textbook. Yes, she makes somebody marks. She makes some philosophy of, you know, that's a beautiful. So it is a formulation of a question that is the open problem. Why is one teacher better than right? What she does, but yeah. What, what, what, what, why? In every level people, how do they get better? What does it mean to be better? The whole? Yeah. Yeah. From, from whatever model I have, one teacher can give a very good predicate. My pitcher can say a severe selected doc and it does, it can say jump like a duck and jump like conducts cut a zero in front of me. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          42:09          So what is the most exciting problem and statistical learning you've ever worked on or are working on now?

Speaker 3:          42:16          Oh, I just feel years is either on story. I believe zipped it is loading story. At least they can shows is that it doesn't nick nicole only what zay say statistical bought from intelligent and they know nothing about intelligent and you know there's intelligent bot so it you'll help us a lot in teaching in the learning. so we'll know it when we see it. So for example, in my talks, the last slide was a challenge. So you have say nist digitalization problem and deploy new claims. If they did it very well, say 99 point five percent of it correct answers, but say you're 60,000 to observational. Yeah. Can you lose a sale user called defenseless but incorporating things in variance. What it means, you know, digital want to see. But yeah, just looking concert explained the vision. The orientation would keep to use examples or say 100 times less examples to do the same job.

Speaker 1:          43:48          Yeah, that last slide in a. Unfortunately you're talking too quickly, but that last slide was a powerful open challenge and a formulation of the essence does exactly

Speaker 3:          44:02          problem often the diligence because

Speaker 3:          44:08          everybody, when nick started it was working with too much emotion. Z immediately recognize that views use much more a trading datas of human needed. but no, again, we came to the same study have to decrease. Is that this problem of loading? It does, like in deploying the z subterranean date, the cost, my resilience of not enough. If you have a good, uh, invariance might be, you'll never collect some observations, but now it is a question to, to intelligence have to do that because statistical part is in here. As soon as your suppliers this predicament, you can do good job in a small amount of observations as a very first challenges will know digital coordination and you know, digits and police, there'll be variance. I think that they can say four digit city. I would introduce concept of horizontal symmetry. So it was a digital has horizontals, symmetry say malls and say digital or something like that. but as soon as I get the deal is announced symmetry, I can watch a lot of measure your senior year or the organon cemetery or whatever, if I could ever deal cbt, but foretells looking on on on digital use it. It is mit, the mit, the predicate which is not shape the subsidy lake cemetery, like half dark. His whole pictures, something like that each can sell for as a predicate.

Speaker 1:          46:16          You think such a predicate could rise of something that's a

Speaker 3:          46:25          not general meaning

Speaker 1:          46:29          it feels like for me to be able to understand the difference between the two and three, I would need to have had a a childhood of 10 to 15 years playing with kids, going to school, being yelled at by parents, all of that walking, jumping, looking at ducks and now then I will be able to generate the right predicate for tying the difference between two and a three. Or do you think there's a more efficient.

Speaker 3:          47:06          Oh no, for sure. You must know some signals of digits yes to. And that's a powerful state, but maybe there are serval languages of description, um, elements of digits. So you talking about symmetry properties, Jordan, talking about some gaps there. I don't know that, but this is a problem of intelligence. So in one article it is revealed to show that every example can cut it not more than one beautiful information in the hill because, uh, with your show example, and you say this is one you can remove a function which does not tell your mom the best strategy if you can do it, the city move off of options. But when you used one predicate which looks like a duck, you can remove much more functions in the cuff. And that to me, that did contain a lot of information from formal point of view. But when you have a little picture what you want to send general picture. So what can you just put indicate? And that predicates carter a lot of noise,

Speaker 3:          48:47          beautifully put maybe just me, but in all the math you show in your work, uh, which is some of the most profound mathematical work in, in, in the field of learning ai. And just math in general, I hear a lot of poetry and philosophy. You really kind of, um, talk about philosophy of science. there's a, there's a poetry and music to a lot of the work you're doing and the way you're thinking about it. So do you. Where does that come from? Do you to escape to poetry? Do you escape to music? Doesn't exist. Ground truth, ground truth is that get seen everywhere. Yeah. The smart guy, she lost them. Sometimes I surprise of the deep sea. Sometimes some of them are completely out of subject, but the sheet music, music is the ground truth be important to you when you point z, z believes if they take dictation. So what a piece of music as a piece of empirical evidence gave you a sense that they are, um, they're touching something in the ground. Truth it to Structure the structure. Listening to bach structure. Yeah, very, very classic. Very simple. It was the same with, when you enjoying the, you can just say the same.

Speaker 1:          50:35          Yeah. Um, and if you look back at your childhood, you grew up in Russia, you maybe were born as a researcher in Russia, you've developed as a researcher in Russia, he came to United States in a few places. If you look back, what were, what was some of your happiest moments as a researcher? Some of the most profound moments, not in terms of their impact on society, but in terms of their impact on how damn good you feel that day and you remember that moment,

Speaker 3:          51:15          you know, every time when you followed something. It is great and everybody, simple things, just like your little feelings that they mostly, most of my time was broke. You should go again and again and again and try to be honest with yourself, look more contemporary, but try to understand that the new way to grant, not marty, blah, blah, blah, that.

Speaker 1:          51:52          But you're allowed to get excited at the, at the possibility of discovery here. You'll have to double check it. But uh,

Speaker 3:          52:01          no, but covered related to throws. Is it just for hair? But you know, you always have a feeling your phone, something of that. So 20 years ago with the discovery of statistical loading, so nobody believe except for one guy dr jay and live in 20 years then became fashion is the same, the support vector machines, machines.

Speaker 1:          52:41          So what was supportive and machines are learning theory with when you were working on it, you had a sense that you had a sense of the profundity of it, the how that this, this seems to be right. It seems to be powerful,

Speaker 3:          53:00          right? Absolutely. Definitely lost waiver and know when fallen zoos. In what story you feel the same feelings. Look at this company because I have perused. No different mechanisms. You can some say cosmetic improvement you can do, but in terms of your audience, the more statistical learning they should work together, but also I'm credited as a fordable lights. What is intelligence that and to separate from technical bottom. Exactly. it's completely different. Absolutely. well thank you so much for talking today. Thank you. It's an honor.
