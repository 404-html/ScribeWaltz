Speaker 1:          00:00          As part of Mit course success, zero, nine, nine on artificial general intelligence, I got a chance to sit down and Christof Koch, who's one of the seminal figures in neurobiology and neuroscience and generally in the study of consciousness. He's the president, the chief scientific officer of the Allen Institute for Brain Science in Seattle from 1986 to 2013. He was the professor at Caltech before that he was at mit. He is extremely well cited, over 100,000 citations. His research, his writing, his ideas have had big impact on the scientific community and the general public in the way we think about consciousness in the way we see ourselves as human beings. He's the author of several books, the quest of consciousness in Europe, biological approach, and a more recent book consciousness, confessions of a romantic reductionist.

Be Part of the course or any ideas that you would like us to explore. Thanks very much and I hope you enjoy. Okay. Before we delve into the beautiful mysteries of consciousness, let's zoom out a little bit and let me ask, do you think there's intelligent life out there in the universe or. Yes, I do believe so.

Speaker 2:          01:25          We have no evidence of it, but I think the possibilities are overwhelming in favor of it. Give them a universe of where we have 10 to 11 galaxies and each galaxy has between 10 to 11, 10 to the twelfth

Speaker 1:          01:37          stars. And we know most stars have one or more planet. So how does that make you feel? It still makes me feel special because I have experiences. I feel the world experienced the world

Speaker 2:          01:52          and uh, independent of whether they are other creatures out there. I still feel the world and I have access to this world in this very strange, compelling way.

Speaker 1:          02:01          And that's the core of human existence. Now you said human. Do you think if those intelligent creatures are out there, do you think they experience their world? That's true. They

Speaker 2:          02:14          evolved. If they are a product of natural evolution, if they would have to be, they will also experience the owned world. The consciousness isn't just Schumann. You hide it. It's much wider. It's probably. It may be spread across all of biology. We have the only thing that we have specialists. We can talk about it. I've got not all people can talk about the babies and little children can talk about a patient who have. We have a stoke in the left. Inferior frontal gyrus can talk about it, but most normal adult people can talk about it and so we think that makes us special compared to letting monkeys or dogs or cats and mice, all the other creatures that we share the planet with, but all the evidence seems to suggest that they to experience the world and so it's like overwhelmingly likely that other alien that aliens would also experience their world of course differently because they have a difference in psyllium. They have different sense of. They have a very different environment, but the fact that I would strongly support that they also have experiences if your pain and pleasure and see in some sort of spectrum and he, uh, and have all the other senses,

Speaker 1:          03:17          of course their language if they have one, will be different. So women understand their poetry about the experiences that they have. That's correct. Right. So in a talk, in a video, I've heard you mentioned adac sound that you came up with the you grew up with as part of your family when you were young. Uh, first of all your technically a midwestern boy. He just technically after that, a trial of that are on a bit and a little bit of the accent. You talked about supports all the taxol and having these elements of human humanness, of consciousness that you discovered. So I just wanted to ask, can you look back in your childhood and remember when was the first time you realized you yourself sort of form a third person perspective or our conscious being this idea of no stepping outside of yourself and seeing there's something special going on here in my brain.

Speaker 2:          04:17          I can't really accurate. It's a good question. I'm not sure I recall a discreet moment. I mean you take it for granted because that's the only world you know. The only world I know you know is the world of seeing and hearing voices and touching and all the other thing, so it's only much later at early in my undergrad days when I became, when I enrolled in physics and in philosophy that I really thought about it and thought, well, this is really fundamentally very, very mysterious and there's nothing really in physics right now that explains this transition from the physics of the brain to feelings. Where do the feelings come in until you can look at the foundational equation of quantum mechanics, general relativity. You can look at the period table of the elements. You can look at the endless atg seat chat and our genes and no is consciousness. Yet I wake up every morning to a world where I have experiences and so that's the hub of the ancient mind body problem. How do explain to get into the world? So what is consciousness, experience consciousness as any, any con, any experience? Some people call it subjective feelings, some people call it a phenomenon, phenomenology, some people call it quality of their philosophy, but they all did note the same thing. It feels like something in the famous word for the philosopher Thomas Nagel. It feels like something to be a bad or to be a, uh, an American or to be angry or to be sad or to be in love or to have pain

Speaker 2:          05:49          and that is what experience is. Any possible experience could be as mundane as just sitting in a chair could be as excited as, you know, having a mystical moment, uh, you know, in, in deep meditation, those also just different forms of experiences,

Speaker 1:          06:03          experience. So if you were to sit down with maybe the next, skip a couple of generations of Ibm Watson, something that won jeopardy, what is the gap? I guess the question is between Watson, uh, that might be a much smarter than you than us, than all any human alive but may not have experience. What is the gap?

Speaker 2:          06:28          Well, so that's a big, big question that's occupy people for the last, certainly the last 50 years since we, since the advent, the birth of have a computer question and chilling title answer and of course he did it in this indirect way by proposing it's tests and operational tests. So, but that's not really, that's, you know, he tried to get it. What does it mean for a person to think and then he had this test that you lock them away and then you have a communication with them and then you title to guess after a whether that is a personal or whether it's a computer system. There's no question that now or very soon, you know, Alexa or Siri or Google, now we'll pass this test and you can game it. But you know, ultimately, certainly in your generation there will be machines that will speak with complete poise that will remember everything you've ever said that.

Speaker 2:          07:16          Remember every email you ever had like Samantha, remember in the movie her. It's no question it's going to have a happen, but of course the key question is it doesn't feel like anything to be Samantha in the movie her or does it feel like anything to be Watson and there one has to be very, very strongly think they're two different concepts here that we call mingle. There is a concept of intelligence, natural or artificial, and there is a concept of consciousness of experience, natural or artificial. Those are very, very different things. Now historically with associate consciousness was intelligence. Why? Because we live in a world leaving aside computers of of natural selection where we're surrounded by creatures, either our own kin that are less or more intelligent or we go costs feces. Some. Some are more adapted to particular environment. Others unless adapted, whether it's a whale or a dog or you go talk to him or a little worm, and we see the complexity of the nervous system goes from one cell to two, a specialized cells to a worm that has been at that has 30 percent of its cells and nerve cells to creature like us or like a blue whale that have had 100 billion nerve cells and so based on behavioral evidence and based on the underlying neuroscience, we believe that as his creatures become more complex, they are better adapted to their particular ecological niche and they become more conscious partly because their brain calls and we believe consciousness, unlike the ancient ancient people thought most almost every culture thought that consciousness was intelligence has to do with your heart and you still see that today.

Speaker 2:          08:56          You see, honey, I love you with all my house, but what you should actually say, you say, no honey, I love you was all my lateral hypothalamus and for Valentine's Day you should give you a sweetheart, a, you know, a hypothalamic shame piece of chocolate and not a hardship chocolate. Right? So we still have this language, but now we believe it's a brain and so we see brains of different complexity and we think, well, they have different levels of consciousness that capable of different experiences. Um, but now we confront a world where we know where we're beginning to engineer intelligence and it's graphical, unclear whether the intelligence we engineering has anything to do with consciousness and whether it can experience anything because fundamentally what's the difference? Intelligence. It's about function intelligence, no matter exactly how you define it, sort of adaptation to new environments. Being able to learn and quickly understand the setup of this and what's going on and who the actors and what's going to happen next. It's all about function. Consciousness is not about function consciousness, it's about being in some sense, much fundamental. You can see folks that, you can see this in several cases. You can see it. For instance, in the case of the clinic, when you're dealing with patients who are, let's say had a stoke or had one traffic accident, etc.

Speaker 3:          10:18          They're pretty much immobile. Terry shy boy, you may have heard historically, she was a person here in the in the nineties and Florida judge heart stood still. She was really animated and for the next 14 years she was in a vegetative state, so there's thousands of people in a vegetative state, so they're, you know, they are, you know, they're like this. Occasionally they opened the eyes for two, three, four, five, six, eight hours and then close the eyes. They have sleep, wake cycle. Occasionally they have behavior they do, but there's no way that you can establish a lawful relationship between what you say or the doctor says or the mom says and what the patient does. So, so the. So the. There isn't any behavior. Get in some of these people. There is still experience. You can, you can design and build brain machine interfaces where you can see there's still experienced something and of course that these cases have blocked in state.

Speaker 3:          11:11          There's a famous book called the diving bell and the butterfly. Well, you had an ediTor to edit a year. The stoke in the in the brain stem, unable to move except his vertical eyes, eye movement. he could just move his eyes up and down. When you dictated an entire book and some people even lose this at the end it all the evidence seems to suggest that they're still in there. In this case, you have no behavior. You have consciousness. Second cases tonight, like all of us, you're going to go to sleep, close your eyes, you go to sleep. You will wake up inside your sleeping body and you will have conscious experiences are different from everyday experience. You might fly. You might not be surprised that you're flying. You might meet a long dead pet childhood dog and you're not surprised that you're meeting them, you know, but you have conscious experience of love, of hates.

Speaker 3:          12:00          You know they can be very emotional. Your body during this state, it typically to them state sends an active signal to your motor neurons to paralyze you. it's called tanya because if you don't have that, like some patients, what do you do? You act out your dreams. You get proximal behavioral disorder, which is about, which is bad juju to get. Okay. Sad case is pure experience. so I recently had this, what some people call it mystical experience. I went to Singapore and went into flotation tank, right? So this is a big tub filled was with water. That's body temperature and epsom salt. You strip completely naked, july, inside of it, you close the lid, darkness, complete darkness, soundproof. So very quickly you become body less because you're floating and you're naked. You have no rings, no watch, no nothing. You don't feel your body anymore.

Speaker 3:          12:52          No sound soundless. There's no a photon, a sightless timeless because after a while, early on, you're actually hear your heart, but then that you sort of adapt to that and then sort oF the pathogen of time, csus, and if you train yourself like in a, in a meditation, not to sleep early on, you think a lot, it's a little bit spooky, you feel somewhat uncomfortable or you think, well, I'm going to get bored, but if your title not to think actively, you become mindless. So there you are. Body less timeless. Soundless sightless mindless. But you're in a conscious experience, you're not asleep, you're not asleep, you're, you, you are being a pure, pure being. There isn't any function. You aren't doing any computation, you're not remembering, you're not projecting, you're not planning yet. You are fully conscious, fully conscious. There is something going out there.

Speaker 3:          13:42          It could be just a side effect. So what is the, the epi phenomenon. So what is the select effect? Meaning why? Uh, what, what, what is the function of you being able to lay in this sense, sensory free deprivation tank and still have a conscious experience? Obviously we didn't evolve with flotation tanks in our environment. I mean, so biology is notoriously bad at asking why. Question anomic question, why do we have two eyes? Why don't we have four or three hours or something? Well, no, there's probably a bit. It'S a function to that, but it's, we're not very good at answering those questions. We can speculate. And leslie were biologists or scientists, very good about mechanistic question, why they're charging the universe, right? We find the universe were there positive and negative charges. Why? Why does quantum mechanics hall? you know, why, why, why doesn't some other theory, quantum mechanics in our university? It's very unclear why so tiller, comical question, why questions are difficult to answer. Clearly there's some relationship between complexity, brain processing, power and consciousness, but however, in these cases, in these three that I gave, one is an everyday experience at night. The other one is a tom on third one is in principle. You can. Everybody can have these sort of mystical experiences. You have a dissociation of function form of intelligence from

Speaker 1:          15:06          I'm from conscious and unconscious. This you caught me asking a why question. Let me ask a question that's not a why question. You're giving a talk later today on the turing test for intelligence and causes a drawn lines between the two. So is there a scientific way to say there's consciousness present in this entity or not? And to anticipate your answer because you will also. There's a neuro biological answer. So we test the human brain, but if you take a machine brain that you don't know tests for yet a, how would you even begin to approach a test of their consciousness precedent in this thing?

Speaker 3:          15:46          Okay, that's a really good question. So let me take two steps. So as you point out for for four months, let's just stick with humans. There's now a test called a zap unzip. It's a procedure where you ping the brain using transcranial magnetic stimulation, you look at the electrical reverberations essentially using egg and then you can measure the complexity of this brain response and you can do this in a weight. People in asleep sleep, normal people. You can do it in a wake people up and then anesthetize them. you can do it in patients and it it, it has a hundred percent accuracy that in all those cases when you're clear the patient or the person that either conscious or unconscious a complexity either high or low and then you can adopt these techniques to similar creatures like monkeys and dogs and, and, and mindset have very similar planes. Now of course you, you point out that may not help you because we don't have a context, you know, and if I send them magnetic pulse into my iphone or my computer, it's probably going to break something. Yeah. So we don't have that. so what we need, ultimately,

Speaker 3:          16:45          we need a theory of consciousness. We can just align our intuition, our intuition as well. Yeah. If somebody talks, they're conscious, right? However, then they all these children, babies don't talk. Right? But we believe that that, that baby's also have conscious experiences. Right? And then there are all these patients I mentioned and they don't talk. When you dream, you can't talk because you're paralyzed. So. So what? What we ultimately need, we can't just rely on our intuition. We need a theory of content that tells us what is it about a piece of matter? What is it about a piece of highly excitable map? I like the brain or like a computer that gives rise to conscious experience. We all believe, none of us believe that anymore in the old story. It's a soul that used to be the most common explanation that most people accept it.

Speaker 3:          17:28          And still a lot of people today believe, well there's god endowed. Only asked was his special thing that animals don't have. They need to call. Famously said, dog, if you hit it with your, catch me yell at me, but it doesn't have this special thing. It doesn't have the magic, the magic sauce. It doesn't have guys downstairs. So now we believe that isn't the case anymore. So what is the difference between brains and, and these guys? Silicon and um, in particular once their behavior matches. So if you have siri, you have alexa in 20 years from now that she can talk just as good as any possible schumann, what counts do you have to say? She's not conscious in particular. If she says, as I've caught, you will cause I'm conscious you also, what are you doing? and she'll say, well, you know, they, they'll generate some way to cost she, she'll behave like a, like a person.

Speaker 3:          18:19          Now there's several differences. One is, so this relates to the problem, the very hot. Why is consciousness a hard problem? It's because it's subjective, right? Only I have it for one. I know I have direct experience of my own consciousness. I don't have eczema. And your consciousness now, I assume as a sort of a bayesian personal believes in probability theory in all of that, you know, I can do, I can do an abduction to the, to the best available tax I did use. Your brain is very similar to mine. If I put you in a scanner, your brain is going to behave the same with I do. If, if, if you know, if I gave you this muesli and ask you how does it taste? You tell me things that you know, that, that I would also say more or less higher. So infer based on all of them that your conscious now it was silly. I can't do that. So there I really need a theory that tells me what is it about, about any system, this or this. It makes it conscious. We have such a theory.

Speaker 1:          19:12          Yes. So the integrated information theory, but let me first maybe as an introduction for people who are not familiar, the car. Can yOu talk a lot about panpsychism? can you describe what a physicalism versus dualism? The. You mentioned the soul. What is the history of that idea? What is the idea of penn psychosis or. No, the debate really out of which panpsychism can emerge of, of, of, um, dualism versus a physicalism or do you not see a panpsychism as fitting into that?

Speaker 3:          19:49          No, you can argue there's some older. Okay. So let's step back. So panpsychism is a very ancient belief that's been around a plato and aristotle talks about it. A modern philosophers talk about it. Of course in buddhism the idea is very prevalent that, I mean the different versions of it. one version says everything is installed. Everything, rocks and stones and dogs and people and foremost an iphone. All of her soul. I'd all, matt is in seoul. That's sort of one version. Another version is that all biology, all creatures smaller, large from a single cell to a giant quietly feel like something that's the one I think is somewhat more realistic. Um, so they're different. What do you mean by feel like something? I have a feeling, have some kind of like, some, it may well be possible that it feels like something to be a power medium.

Speaker 3:          20:39          I think it's pretty likely it feels like something to be a b or a mouse or dog. Sure. So, okay, so, so that you can see that's also. So pam is very broad and you can some people, for example, a proton mccastle try to advocate this. This idea is called alien monism that, that panpsychism is really physics viewed from the inside. So the idea is that physics is very good at describing relationship among objects like charges or like gravity, you know, this relationship between curvature and mass distribution. Okay. That's the relationship among things. Physics doesn't really discard the ultimate reality itself. It's just relationship among quarks or all these other stuff was sort of like a third observer. Yes. And consciousness is what physics feels on the inside to my conscious experience. It's a way that physics of my brain, particular my cortex feels from the inside.

Speaker 3:          21:38          And so if you meet them, you to remember you say panamanian, well that's a pretty dumb creature this, but it has already a billion different molecules probably, you know, 5,000 different proteins assemble in a highly, highly complex system that no single person, no computer system so far on this planet has ever managed to accurately simulate its complexity. Vastly escapes us. Yes. And it may well be that that little thing feels like a tiny bit. No, it doesn't have a voice in their head like me. It doesn't have expectations, you know, it doesn't have all that complex things, but it may well feel like something. Yeah. So This is really interesting. Can we draw some lines and maybe try to understand the difference between life intelligence and consciousness. How do you see all of those? If she has to define what is a living thing, what is a conscious thing and what is an intelligent thing?

Speaker 3:          22:31          Do those intermix for you? Or are they totally separate or. Okay. So a, that's a question that we don't have a full. And a lot of this stuff we're talking about today is full of mysteries. And fascinating ones, right it, while the approximately you can go to other startle who's probably the most important scientists and philosophers ever lived in. Certainly in western culture. He had this idea, it's called hylomorphism. It's quite popular these days that there are different forms of soul. The soul is really the form of something he saw. He says, all biological kj have a vegetive soul. That's life principle today we think we understand something molded it's biochemistry and nonlinear thermodynamics, right? Then he said they have a sensitive, so only animals and humans have also a sensitive soul or an appetitive soul. They can see, they can smell and they have drives.

Speaker 3:          23:18          They wanted tO put, reproduce, they want to eat, et cetera, and then only humans have what he called a rational soul. Okay. And that idea that made it into christian dome and then the rational soul is the one that lives forever. He was very unclear. he wasn't really, I mean different readings or virustotal give different what that did he believe that international show was a model or not, but I probably think he didn't, but then of course had made it into a play to under christianity and then this all became immortal and then became the the connection to god. Now you, so you were asking me essentially, what does our modern conception of these fleet aristotle would have called them different forms live. We think we know something about it, at least live on this planet, although we don't understand how to originated, but it's been difficult to rigorously pin down.

Speaker 3:          24:05          You see this in modern definition of death. It's the fact that I had. Now there's a conference ongoing. Again, that ties to defined legally and medically. What is death? It used to be very simple. As you stop breathing, your heart stops beating your dad. Totally unconverted lead. If you're unsure you wait another 10 minutes. If the patient doesn't please, you know he's dead. Well, now we have ventilators. We have half of a peacemaker, so it's much more difficult to define. What this is typically does is defined at the end of life and life has defined before death before that. Okay. So we don't have really very good definitions. Intelligence, we don't have a rigorous definition. We know something how to measure it, called iq or gi factors hide and, and we're beginning to build it in, in a narrow sense. I'd like go alphago and, and, and, and watson and you know, google cars and uber cars and all of that. That's still now I am. some people are thinking about artificial general intelligence, but actually as we've said before, it's something to do with ability to learn and to adapt to new environments. But that is, as I said, also, it's radical difference from experience and it's very unclear if you build a machine that has agi, it's not at all, not at all clear that this machine will have consciousness. It may or may not. So let's ask it the other way.

Speaker 1:          25:22          Do you think if you were to try to build an artificial general intelligence system, can you think, uh, figuring out how to build artificial consciousness? What would help you get to an agi? So or put another way, do you think intelligent requires consciousness in shumen it goes hand in hand

Speaker 3:          25:43          in shumen or. I think in biology, consciousness and intelligence goes hand in hand. Quite is illusion because the plane evolved to be highly complex. Complexity via this theory, integrated information theory is sort of ultimately is what is closely tied to consciousness. Ultimately it's causal power upon itself and so in evolution evolved systems ego together in artificial system, particularly in digital machines, they do not go together and if you ask me, point blank is alexa 20 point, oh, in the year 20, 41, she can easily pass every two intestines. She conscious no. Even if she claims she's concert. In fact, you could even do more radical version of this thought experiment. We can build a computer simulation of the human brain. you know what henry markram in the blue brain project or the human brain project in Switzerland, it's kind of do them all the success. So in 10 years we have this perfect simulation of the human brain.

Speaker 3:          26:36          Every new owner stimulated and it has alarm makes and it has motor neuron. It has a pocket area and of course talk and they'll say, hi, I just woke up. I feel great. Okay. Even that computer simulation that can imprint so map onto your brain will not be conscious. Why? Because it simulates. It's a difference between this simulated in the real, so it simulates the behavior salted with consciousness. It might be, it will. If it's done properly, we'll have all the intelligence that that particular person they're simulating has, but simulating intelligence, it's not the same as having conscious experiences and I give you a really nice metaphor that engineers and physicists typically get. I can write down einStein's field equations nine or 10 equations that describe the lincoln general relativity between curvature and and mass. I can do that. I can run this on my laptop to to predict that the sample, the black hole at the center of our galaxy will be so massive that it twists space time around it so no light can escape it.

Speaker 3:          27:36          It'S a black hole, but funny. have you ever wondered, why doesn't this computer simulation suck me in ict? It simulates gravity, but it doesn't have the causal power of gravity. IT's a huge difference. So it's a difference between the real and the simulator, just like it doesn't get wet inside the computer when the computer code that similar to weather a storm and so in order to have to have artificial continents, you have to give it the same. Causal powers is human brain. You have to build, took all the new amorphic machine that has hardware that is very similar to the human brain, not a digital

Speaker 1:          28:14          clark for nine computer. So that's just to clarify thouGh, you think that consciousness is not required to create human level intelligence. It seems to accompany in the human brain, but for machine not have court. So maybe just because this is agi. Let's dig in a little bit about what we mean by intelligence. So one thing is the g factor, these kinds of iq tests of intelligence, but I think if you maybe another way to say, so in 20, 40, 20, 50 people have siri that is just really impressive. Do you Think people will say series intelligent? Yes. Intelligence. Is this a morphous thing? So to be intelligent, it seems like you have to have some kind of connections with other human beings in a sense that you have to impress them with your intelligence and their fields. You have to somehow operate in this world full of humans and for that there feels like there has to be something like consciousness. So you think you can have just the world's best natural lp system, natural language, understanding regeneration, and that will be, that will get us happy and say, you know what, we've created an agi happy.

Speaker 3:          29:37          Yes, I do believe we can get what we call high level functional intelligence, sort of

Speaker 2:          29:42          the, gee, you know, this, this fluid like intelligence that we challenged, particularly the place like mit, right in, in, in machines. I see apple, you know, reasons and I've see a lot of reason to believe it's going to happen, you know, over the next 50 years or 30 years.

Speaker 1:          29:58          So for beneficial ai for creating an ai system. That's um, so you mentioned ethics that is exceptionally intelligent but also does not do, does aligns its values with our values as humanity. Do you think then in his consciousness,

Speaker 2:          30:14          yes. I think that that is a verY good argument that if we're concerned about ai and the threat of ai are nick bostrom existentialist, dread. I think having an intelligent that has empathy, right? Why do we find abusing a dog? Why do most of us find that upholland abusing any animal? I'd. Why do we find that the holland, because we have this thing called empathy, which if you look at the greek really means feeling with I feel empathy. I have feeling with you. I see somebody else suffer. That isn't even my conspecific I. It's not a person. It's not a lot, but it's not my wife or my kids. It's a dog, but I feel naturally most of us, not all of us, most of us will feel emphatic and so it may well be in the longterm interest of survival of homo sapiens. Sapiens said, if we do build agi and it's really becomes very powerful that it has an emphatic response and doesn't just exterminated humanity. So as part of the full

Speaker 1:          31:13          conscious experience, uh, to, to create a consciousness artificial or in our human consciousness, do you think fear, maybe we're going to get it into your earlier days in each and so on, but do you think fear and suffering are essential, uh, to have consciousness? Do you have to have the full range of experience to have, to have a system that has experienced or can you have a system that only has a very particular kinds of very positive experience?

Speaker 2:          31:41          Look you can have in Pennsylvania, you can. People have done this in the vat. Will you implanted electrodes in the hypothalamus, the pleasure center of the bat and that stimulated sob above and beyond anything else? It doesn't care about food or natural sex or drink anymore to stimulate itself because it's such a pleasurable feeling. I guess it's like an orgasm just you'll have, you know, all day long. And so I see no reason why you need different, why you need a great variety now. Clearly to survive that wouldn't work. But if I engineered artificially, I don't think, I don't think you need a great variety of conscious experience. You could have just pleasure or just feel it might be a tablet systems, but I think that's possible, at least on conceptual logical can cause any real creature, whether artificially engineered. Do you want to give it fear, the fear of extinction that we all have a. And you also want to give it a positive competitive states states that it wants to, that you want the machine in coach to do because if they give the machine positive feedback.

Speaker 1:          32:47          So you mentioned panpsychism to jump back a little bit, you know, everything having some kind of mental property, uh, how, how do you go from there to something like human consciousness? So everything having some elements of consciousness to. Well, is there something special about human consciousness? What's so just, it's not everything like a sport. There's no.

Speaker 2:          33:13          The of panpsychism I think of, well, it doesn't ski consciousness to anything like this, the spoon or my liver. However, uh, it is, uh, the theory of integrated information theory. It does say that system, even ones that look from the outside, the relatively simple, at least if they have this internal calvo power, they are the. It does feel like something. The theory I polio doesn't say anything. What's special about schumann biologically we know what the one thing that's special about human is we speak and we have an overblown sense of our own importance, right? Can we believe we are exceptional and we're just god's gift to, to into the universe, but the but behaviorally the main thing that we have, we can plan, we can plan or the longterm and we have language and that gives us enormous amount of power. That's why we are the dominant species on the planet.

Speaker 1:          34:05          So you mentioned god, you grew up a devout roman catholic, a roman catholic family. So you know what consciousness you're sort of exploring some really deeply fundamental human things that religion also touches on. So where does, where does religion fit into your thinking about consciousness and you've, you've grown throughout your life and changed your views on religion as far as I understand.

Speaker 2:          34:32          Yeah. I mean I'm not much closer to. So I'm not a roman catholic anymore, I don't believe there's sort of this god, the god I was, I was educated to believe in, you know, sit somewhere in the fullness of time. I'll be united in some sort of everlasting bliss. I just don't see any evidence for that. look, the world the night is large and full of wonders. there are many things that I don't understand. I think many things that we as a cult, he look, we don't even understand more than four percent of all the, uh, universe, dark matter, dark energy. We have no idea what it is. MayBe it's lost socks. What do I know? So, so all I can tell you is sort of my, my current religious or spiritual sentiment is much closer to some form of buddhism.

Speaker 1:          35:16          Can you just tell debbie income, asian? Unfortunately, there's no evidence for reincarnation. So can you describe a way buddhism sees the world a little bit?

Speaker 2:          35:25          Well, so the, you know, they talk about. So when I spent several meetings with, with the dalai lama and what always impressed me about him, he really, unlike, for example, a t there, the pope or some cottonelle, he emphasize

Speaker 3:          35:38          minimizing the suffering of all creatures. So they have this from the early beginning. They look at suffering in all creatures, not just in people, but in everybody. This universal and of course by degrees, right? An animal child Will have a less, is less capable of suffering than a, than a well developed a normally developed human and um, they think consciousness pervades in this universe and they have these techniques, you know, you can think of them like mindfulness, etc. in meditation that ties to access sort of what they claim of this more fundamental aspect of reality. I'm not sure it's more fundamentalist. I think about it. There's a physical and then there's this insight you consciousness. and those are the two aspects. That's the only thing I've, I've access to in my life. And you've got to remember my conscious expense and you're consciously explains, comes prior to anything you know about physics comes pi to knowledge about the universe and atoms and superstrings and molecules and all of that. The only thing you directly acquainted with this world that's populated with things in images and sounds in your head and touch us and all of that.

Speaker 4:          36:43          I actually have a question. So it sounds like you kind of have a rich life. You talk about rock climbing and it seems like you really love literature and conscious ness is all about experiencing things. So do you think that has helped your research on this topic?

Speaker 3:          37:00          Yeah. Yes. Particularly if you think about it, the value of statesville program when you do are climbing or now I do. I'm going in a bike everyday you can get into this thing called the zone and I've always wanted. I wanted above about a particular with respect to continence because it's a strangely addictive state. You want to, you want to appear. I mean, once people have had ones who want to keep on going back to it and you wonder why, what is it so addicting about it, and I think it's the experience of, of almost close to pure experience because in this, in this zone, you're not conscious of inner voice anymore. There's always the inner voice nagging you or do you have to do this? You have to do that. You have to pay your taxes. He had this fight with your ex and all of those things are always there, but when you're in the zone, all of that is gone and your justice in this wonderful state, while you're fully out in the world, you're, you're, you're climbing or biking or doing soccer, what or whatever you're doing and sort of consciousness sort of.

Speaker 3:          37:54          It says you're all action, or in this case, a pure experience. You're not actually at all, but in both cases you experienced some aspect of of con. You touched some basic part of of, of conscious existence and it's so basic and so deeply satisfying you. I think you tapped the award of being. That's really what you're touching there. You're getting close to the root of being and that's very different from intelligence. So what do you think about

Speaker 4:          38:23          the simulation hypothesis, simulation theory, the idea that we all live in a computer simulation. Have you done that?

Speaker 3:          38:28          Just put notes, laptops for nerds, for nerds. I think it's as likely as the hypothesis that engaged

Speaker 2:          38:36          hundreds of scholars for many centuries. Are we all just existing in the mind of god? Right? And this is just a modern version of it. It's, it's, it's, it's equally plausible. People love talking about these types of things. I know that book written. So what the simulation hypothesis. If that's what people want to do, that's fine. Seems ratHer esoteric. It's never testable,

Speaker 1:          38:58          but it's not useful for you to think of it in those terms. So maybe connecting to the questions of freewill, which you've talked about. Um, I, I think vaguely remember you saying that the idea that there is no freewill, uh, it makes you very uncomfortable. Uh, so what do you think about freewill in, from, from a physics perspective, from a conscious perspective, what does it all fit?

Speaker 2:          39:20          Okay. So from the physics perspective, leaving aside quantum mechanics, we believe we live in a fully deterministic world, right? But then comes up course quantum mechanics. So now we know that certain things on principle, not predictable, which I put as you said, I prefer because the idea that at the initial condition of the universe and then everything else would just acting out the initial condition of the universe. That doesn't. That doesn't mean it's not a romantic notion. Suddenly not right now when it comes to consciousness, I think we do have certain freedom. We are much more constrained by physics of course, and by our paths and by our own conscious desires and what our pounds told us and what our environment tells us. We, we all know that there's hundreds of experiments that show how we can be influenced. But finally in the final analysis, When you make a life that I'm talking about really about critical decision where you really think, should I marry?

Speaker 2:          40:10          Should I go to this school, have that, could take this job, that job. Should I cheat on my taxes are not the sort of, these are things where you really deliberate and I think on those condition you are as free as you can be when you, when you bring your entire being and time conscious being to that question and title analysts analyze it on all the the values, condition. Then you take, you make a decision. You are as free as you can ever be. That is, I think what free will is. It's not a will. That's totally free to do anything it wants. That's not possible.

Speaker 1:          40:45          Right? So as jack mentioned, you actually write a blog about books you've read amazing books from. I'm rushing from my son. Might have been tough. Yeah. Neil gaiman, carl sagan murakami. So what is a book that early in your life transform the way you saw the world? Something that changed your life,

Speaker 2:          41:09          I guess did the spokes are twisted because he talks about some of these problems, you know, he was one of the first discovery of the unconscious because, you know, a little bit before freud when it wasn't in the air and you know, he makes all these claims that people sort of, I know the guys on the mass of charity actually are very non charitable. So he of really the first discovery of a great line of the, of the unconscious and that, uh, that really taught me.

Speaker 1:          41:41          And what do you think, what do you think about the unconscious w? What do you think about freud with think about these ideas? What's, what's just like dark matter in the universe? What's over there in that unconscious

Speaker 2:          41:51          a lot. I mean much more than we think, right? This is what a lot of last hundred years of research has shown. So I think he was a genius, misguided towards the end, but he was all. He started out as a neuroscientist. He contributed, he did studies on the, um, on the lamprey, contributed himself to the neuron hypothesis, the idea that they're discrete units that we call ourselves now. And then he started, then he, he, um, bought, you know, about the unconscious and I think it's too, there's lots of stuff happening. You feel this particular, um, when you're in a relationship and it breaks our son now, right? And then you have this terrible. You can have love and hate and lust and anger and all. It's mixed in. And when you title analyzed yourself, why am I so upset? it's very, very difficult to penetrate to those basements, those cabins in your mind because the subconscious doesn't have access to those, but there they are made in the amygdala or lots of other places. They make you upset or angry or sad or depressed. And it's very difficult to try to actually uncover the reason you can go to a shrink. You can talk wIth your friend endlessly. You couldn't start finally a story why this happened, why you love or don't love her or whatever, but you don't really know whether that's actually the way that that actually happened because you simply don't have access to those parts of the brain and they're very powerful.

Speaker 1:          43:09          You think that's a feature or a bug of our brain? The fact that we have this deep difficult to dive into subconscious.

Speaker 2:          43:16          I think it's a feature because otherwise, look, we are like any other brain or nervous system or computer. We are severely band limited. If we, if everything I do, every emotion I feel every eye movements I make, if all of that had to be under the control of consciousness, I couldn't. I couldn't. I wouldn't be here. Right? So, so what you do early on your brain, you have to be conscious when you learn things like typing or like riding on a bike, but then what you do, you attain up our basal ganglia and stratum you. You train up different parts of your brain and then once you do it automatically like typing, you can show you do it much faster without even thinking about it because you've got these highly specialized what francis crick and I called zombie agents

Speaker 1:          44:06          that I can sort of taken care of that while your consciousness can sort of worry about the abstract sense of the text to one of wide and I think that's true for many, many things, but for the things like uh, all the fights you had with the ex girlfriend, things that you would think are not useful to still linger somewhere in the subconscious. So that seems like a bug that it would staY there.

Speaker 2:          44:28          You think it would be better if you can analyze and then get it out the system

Speaker 1:          44:32          or just forget it ever happened? You know, that that seems a very buggy kind of.

Speaker 2:          44:37          Yeah. In general we don't have. And that's probably functional. We don't have an ability unless it's extremely off cases, clinical dissociation side when people are heavily abused, when they completely repressed the memory. But that doeSn't happen in, in, in, you know, in normal people we don't have an ability to move traumatic memories and of course we suffer from that. On the other hand, probably if you had the ability to constantly wipe your memory, you'll probably do it to an extent that isn't useful to you. So

Speaker 1:          45:08          yeah, it's a good question. it's a balance. So I'm on the books, as jack mentioned, correct me if I'm wrong, but a broadly speaking in academia and the different scientific disciplines, certainly in engineering, reading literature seems to be a rare pursuit. Perhaps I'm wrong in this, but that's in my experience, most people are much more technical texts and do not sort of escape or seek truth in literature. Um, it seems like you do a. So what do you think is the value? What do you think literature as the pursuit of scientific truth, do you think it's good? It's useful for a

Speaker 2:          45:47          government access too much wide, uh, of a, of a, of human experiences.

Speaker 1:          45:52          How valuable do you think it is?

Speaker 2:          45:54          Well, if you want to understand human nature and nature in general, then I think you'll have to better understand wide variety of experiences, not just sitting in a lab staring at a screen and having a piece flashed onto your planner, melissa pushing a button. That's what. That's what I usually do that for most psychologists do. there's nothing wrong with that, but you need to consider lots of other strange states and literature is a shortcut for this as well. Yeah, because literature, that's what literature is all about. All sorts of interesting experiences that people have know the contingency of it, the fact that you know, women experience a world different. Black people experience the world different and the one way to expense that is reading all these different literature and title. Find out you, you see everything so relative and you read the book years ago they thought about certain problems very, very differently than the. Then as today, we today, like any culture, I think we know it all. That's common to every culture. Every culture believes that at a td. They know it all and then you realize, well, there's other ways of viewing the universe and some of them may have lots of things in their favor.

Speaker 1:          46:56          So this is a question I wanted to ask about timescale or scale in general, when you with it or in general tried to think about consciousness. Trying to think about these ideas were kind of naturally thinking human timescales. Do you um, or, and also, uh, entities that are sized close to humans, do you think of things that are much larger, much smaller as containing consciousness and do you think are things that take, you know, you know, the ages? Yeah, to, uh,

Speaker 3:          47:30          to operate in their conscious cause. Effect cause effect. It's a reallY good question. So yeah, I think a lot about small creatures because experimentally, you know, a lot of people work on flies and bees. I, so most people just think they are tolmatter. They're just bags for heaven sake. Right? But if you look at their behavior, like being, he can recognize individual humans, they have this very complicated way to communicate. If you've ever been involved with, you know, your pounds when they bought a house, what sort of agonizing decision that is, and bees have to do that once a year. I'd when they swarm in the spring and then they have this very elaborate way. They have free not scouted the. They go to the individual sites, they come back, they have this power, this dance. Literally where the dance was several days. They try to recruit other leaders.

Speaker 3:          48:10          Very complicated decision. Wait, when they finally wanting to make a decision, the entire swarm, their scouts warm up the entire swim and then go to one occasion. They don't go to christian. They go to one location that they scout type agreed upon by themselves. That's awesome. But look at the circuit complexity. It's 10 times more dense than anything we have in our brain or they only have a million neurons, but then you amazingly complex, complex behavior, very complicated circuitry. So there's no question that they experienced. Something they alive is very different. They're tiny. The only live you know for, for workers live from maybe for two months. So I think it tells you this, in principle, the substrate of consciousness is the substrate that maximizes the cause effect power over all possible spatial temporal grains. So when I think about, for example, do you know the science fiction story, the black cloud, it's a classic, I forgot holiday astronomer.

Speaker 3:          49:00          He has this cloud intervening between the earth and the sun and I'm leading to some sort of to global cooling. This is written in the fifties. It turns out you can using the, the um, the radio dish they communicate was actually an entity to actually intelligent entity and they, they, they sort of, they convinced her to move away. But here you have a radical different entity. And in pencil it says, well, you can measure the, the integrated information in principle at least. And yes, if that, if the maximum of that occurs at a timescale of month rather than an asset for the fraction of a second. Yes. And they would experience life where each moment is a month rather than, um, or microseconds, right? Rather than a fraction of a second in the human case. And so there may be forms of conscience that we simply don't recognize for what they are because they are so radical, different from anything you and I are used to.

Speaker 3:          49:55          Again, that's why it's good to read. Or to what science fiction where we want to think about this like this. Do you know stanislaw lem, this polished and sectional he bought it was turned into a hollywood movie. His best novel. So it was in the sixties, very, very engineered, engineered back on his most interesting novel is called the victoria's where I'm human, civilization they, they, they, they, they have this mission to this planet and everything is just tired and they discover machines. Schumann's got killed and then these machines took over. There was a machine evolution at dominion evolution. He talks about this very vividly and finally the dominant. They're the dominant machine intelligence organisms that survive are gigantic clouds of little hexagonal universal cell automata. This was in the sixties, but typically they're all lying on the ground individual by themselves. But in times of kaiser's econ, communicate the assembling to gigantic nets into clouds. Billions of these particles and then theY become hyper intelligent and they can beat anything that humans can of control it. It, it's a very beautiful and compelling where you have an intelligence where finally the schumann's leave the planet. TheY simply unable to understand and comprehend this creature and they can say, well, either we can nuke the entire planet and just tired or we just have to leave because fundamentally it's an, it's an alien. It's so alien from us in our ideas that we cannot communicate with them.

Speaker 1:          51:21          Yeah. Actually in conversation. So your talent to us steel steel from brought up is that there could be to his ideas that, you know, you already have these artificial general intelligence like super smart or maybe conscious beings in these sally or tom and we just don't know how to talk to them. So that's the language of communication because you don't know what to do with it. So that's one sort of view is a consciousness is only something you can measure. So it's not conscious if you can't measure it.

Speaker 3:          51:49          So you're making an ontological and an epistemic statement. One is they are, they are. it's just like seeing their multiverses. That might be cool, but I can't communicate with them. I don't have. I can't have any noncitizen. That's an epistemic argument to. Those are two different things, so it may well be possible. Look at another case that's happening right now. People are building these mini organoids. Do you know what is so you know you can take stem cells from under your arm, put it in a dish ad for transcription factors, and then you can induce him to to go into large with large. They have few millimeter. They are like a half a million neurons that looked like nerve cells in a dish called mini organoids at harvard and stanford. EverYwhere they're building them. It may be well be possible that they're beginning to feel like something, but we can't really communicate with them right now. So people are beginning to think about the ethics of this, right? So yes, he may be perfectly high, but they made. It's one question. Are they conscious or not? As totally separate question, how would I know? Those are two different things,

Speaker 1:          52:45          right? If you could give advice to a young researcher sort of dreaming of understanding or creating human level intelligence or consciousness, what would you say follow your dreams? Read quite widely. Know I mean I, I suppose, what discipline, what, what is the pursuit that they should take on? Is it neuroscience? Is a competition of cognitive science? Is it philosophy? Is it computer science or politics? I

Speaker 3:          53:16          know in a sense that okay, so the only known system that have high level of intelligence is homo sapiens, so if you wanted to build it, it's probably good to continue to study closely what humans do. So cognitive neuroscience, you know, somewhere between cognitive neuroscience on the one hand than some philosophy of mind and then ai, ai, computer science. You can look at all the original ideas, new network. They all came from neon signs, right? Or reinforcement, whether it's snarky, minsky billing is snarky or whether it's, you know, the early in visal experiments that. How about that? Then gave rise to networks and then multilayer networks, so it may well be possible. In fact, some people are you there to make the next big step in ai. Once we realize the limits of deep convolutional networks, I didn't do certain things, but they can't really understand. I did, don't they?

Speaker 3:          54:05          They don't really. They can't really. I can't really show in one image, I can show you a single image of somebody pick pocket who steals a wallet from a purse. You immediately know that's a pickpocket. right now. Computer system will just say, well, it's a man. It's a woman. It's a purse. Unless you turn this machine on, showing it 100,000 pickpockets. I taught it doesn't. It doesn't have this easy understanding that you have. All right, so so some people make the ironman in order to go to the next step or you really want to build machines that understand in a way, you and I, we have to go to psychology. We need to understand how we do it in our brains, enable us to do it, and so therefore being on the cast, it's also so exciting to try to understand better our nature and then to build to take some of those insight and build them. So I think the most exciting thing is somewhere in the interface between cognitive science, neuroscience, ai, computer science and philosophy of mind.

Speaker 1:          54:56          beautiful. yeah. I'd say if there is from the machine learning for from the computer science, computer vision perspective may have the research is kind of ignore the way the human brain works. You can or even psychology or literature or studying the brain. I would hope josh tannenbaum talks about bringing that in more and more and that's a. So you've worked on some amazing stuff throughout your life. What's the thing that you're really excited about? What's the mystery that you would love to uncover in the near term beyond beyond all the mr dharia already surrounded by.

Speaker 3:          55:32          Well, so that's this tuck shop called the cloth [inaudible]. Underneath our cortex is a big. You have one on the left, right underneath this, underneath the insula. It's very thin, it's like one millimeter, it's embedded in, in wiring in white matter is, it's very difficult to image and um, it has, uh, it has connection to every cortical region and francis kicked the last paper you have, have he dictated corrections the day he died in hospital on this paper. He and we, it hypothesized, well because it has this unique anatomy, it gets input from every cortical area and projects back to every area that the function of this structure is similar. That it's just a metaphor to the role of conducting a sYmphony orchestra. You have all the different cortical players, you have some that do motion, some they do with theory of mind that in, for social interaction and calais and hearing and all the different modules and cortex, but of course what consciousness is.

Speaker 3:          56:29          Consciousness puts it all together into one package, right? The binding problem, all of that. And this is really the function because it has relatively few nuanced compared to cop cappex, but it, it, it talks it a, it seeks input from all of them and they project back to all of them. And so we're testing that right now, we've got this beautiful new owner reconstruction in the mouse called count of thought and kind of found new onset or in the classroom that have the most widespread connection of any nerve new on I've ever seen. They're very, they, you have individually onto sit in the clouds from tiny.
