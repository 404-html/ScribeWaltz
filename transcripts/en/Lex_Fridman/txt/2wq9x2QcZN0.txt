Speaker 1:          00:00:00       The following is a conversation with Eric Weinstein. He's a mathematician, economist, physicist, and the managing director of Teal capital. He coined the term and you can say is the founder of the intellectual dark web, which is a loosely assembled group of public intellectuals. That includes Sam Harris, Jordan and Pearson, Steven Pinker, Joe Rogan, Michael Shermer, and a few others. This conversation is part of the artificial intelligence podcasts at MIT and beyond. If you enjoy it, subscribe on Youtube, iTunes, or simply connect with me on Twitter at [inaudible] Friedman, spelled f, r I. D. And now here's my conversation with Eric Weinstein.

Speaker 2:          00:00:44       Are you nervous about this? Scared shitless. Okay. The busboy, Chris. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:00:50       You mentioned Kung Fu panda is one of your favorite movies. It has the usual profile master student dynamic going on. So who was, who has been a teacher that's significant influence the direction of your thinking in life's work? So if you're the Kung Fu panda, who was your she fu? Oh, well it's interesting because I didn't see she as being the teacher who was the teacher. Oui. Master. Obey the turtle. All the turtle, right? They only meet twice and the

Speaker 2:          00:01:19       tire film and the first conversation sort of doesn't count. So the magic of the film, in fact, it's point yeah. Is that the teaching that really matters is transferred during a single conversation. Right. And it's very brief. And so who played that role in my life, I would say, uh, either, uh, my grandfather, uh, Harry Reuben and his wife Sophie Reuben, my grandmother or Tom Lehrer top layer. Yeah. In which way if you give a child Tom Lehrer records, what you do is you destroy their ability to be taken over by later malware. And it's so irreverent, so witty, so clever, so obscene that it destroys the ability to lead a normal life for many people. So if I meet somebody who usually really shifted from any kind of neurotypical presentation, I'll often ask them, uh, are you a Tom Lehrer fan? And the odds that they will respond or are quite high.

Speaker 2:          00:02:34       Now, Tom Layer is a poisoning pigeons in the park Tom Layer. That's very interesting. There are a small number of Tom Lehrer songs that broke into the general population poisoning pigeons in the park. The element song and perhaps the Vatican reg. Uh, so when you meet somebody who knows those songs but doesn't know how you're judging me right now, aren't you harshly? Uh, no, but you're Russian. So I got as a you known Nico Evanovich a Chesky. That's us. Yeah. So that was a song about plagiarism that was in fact plagiarized, which most people don't know from Danny Kaye. Uh, we're, Danny Kaye did a song called Stanislavski of the Musky Arts. And so Tom Lehrer did this brilliant job of plagiarizing a song about and making it about plagiarism and then making it about this mathematician who worked in non EUCLIDEAN geometry. That was like a giving heroin to a child. It was extremely addictive and eventually led me to a lot of different places, one of which may have been a phd in mathematics. And he was also at least the lecture in mathematics, I believe at Harvard. Something like that. Yeah, I just had dinner with him. In fact, when my son turned 13, we didn't tell him, but, um, his bar Mitzvah present was dinner with his hero, Tom Lehrer and a toddler was 88 years old, sharp as a tack, irreverent and funny as hell. And just, you know, there are very few people in this world that you have to meet while they're still here. And that was definitely one for our family. So that wit is a reflection

Speaker 1:          00:04:13       of intelligence in some kind of deep way. Like where that would be a good test of intelligence, whether you're a Lehrer fan. So what do you think that is about? What about that kind of humor, ability to see the absurdity in existence? What do you think that's connected to intelligence or we just to Jews on a mic that appreciate that kind of humor? No,

Speaker 2:          00:04:35       I think that it's absolutely connected to intelligence. So you can, you can see it. There's a place where Tom Lehrer decides that he's going to lampoon, uh, Gilbert of Gilbert and Sullivan and he's going to outdo Gilbert with clever, meaningless wordplay. And he has, I forget the honesty. He, he's doing clementine as if Gilbert and Sullivan wrote it and he says that I missed her depressed. Her young sister named Mr this, Mr Pessler, she tried pestering sisters, a festering blister. You best to resist or say I the sister persisted. The Mr existed. I kissed her, all loyalty slipped when he said, when she said, I could have her, her sister's cadaver must surely have turned in a script that's so dense. It's so insane that that's clearly intelligence, uh, because it's hard to construct something like that. If I look at my favorite Tom Lear, Tom Lehrer lyric, you know, there's a perfectly absurd one, which is once all the Germans were warlike and mean, but that couldn't happen again. We taught them a lesson in 1918 and they've hardly bothered us since then. Right? That is a different kind of intelligence. You know, you're taking something that is so horrific and you're, you're sort of making it palatable and funny and demonstrating also, um, just your humanity. I mean, I think the thing that came through as, as Tom Lehrer wrote all of these terrible, horrible lines was just what a sensitive and beautiful soul he was who was channeling pain through humor and through grace

Speaker 1:          00:06:02       I've seen throughout Europe, throughout Russia that same kind of humor emerge from the generation of World War Two. It seemed like that humor is required to somehow deal with the pain and the suffering of that that war created. Well,

Speaker 2:          00:06:16       you do need the environment to create the broad Slavic soul. I don't think that many Americans really appreciate, um, Russian humor. How you had to joke during the time of let's say article 58 under Stalin, you had to be very, very careful. You know, the, the concept of a Russian satirical magazine like crocodile a doesn't make sense. So you have this cross cultural problem that there are certain areas of human experience that it would be better to know nothing about. And quite unfortunately, eastern Europe knows a great deal about them, which makes the, you know, the songs of letting me or Wysocki's so potent the, uh, you know, the pros of Pushkin, whatever it is, uh, you have to appreciate the depth of the Eastern European experience. And I, I would think that perhaps Americans knew something like this around the time of the civil war or maybe, um, you know, under slavery and Jim Crow or even the, uh, harsh tyranny of a, the coal and steel employers during the Labor wars. Um, but in general, I would say it's hard for us to understand and imagine the collective culture unless we have the system of selective pressures. For example, uh, Russians were subjected to,

Speaker 1:          00:07:42       yeah. So if there is one good thing and that comes out of a war, it's literature, art and a humor and music. Oh, I don't think so. I think almost everything is good about war except for death and destruction, right? Eh, without the death they would bring, uh, and the romance of it. The whole thing is nice. This is why we're always

Speaker 2:          00:08:04       caught up in war and we have this very ambiguous relationship to it, is that it makes life real and pressing and meaningful

Speaker 1:          00:08:12       and at an unacceptable price. And the price has never been higher. So jumping into AI a little bit, you, uh, in one of the conversation you had or one of the videos you described that one of the things AI systems can't do and biological systems, can his self replicate in the physical world? No, no, no. In the physical world, well, yes, the physical robots can't self replicate, but if it, but this is a very tricky point,

Speaker 2:          00:08:46       which is that the only thing that we've been able to create that's really complex that has an analog of our reproductive system

Speaker 1:          00:08:55       is software. But nevertheless, software rep replicates itself. If we're speaking strictly for the replication in this kind of digital space. So let me just to begin, let me ask a question. Do you see a protective barrier or a gap between the physical world and the digital world?

Speaker 2:          00:09:15       What's that? Call it digital, let's call it the logical world versus the physical world. Why logical? Well, because even though we had, let's say, Einstein's brain preserved, uh, it was meaningless to us as a physical object because we couldn't do anything with what was stored in it at a logical level. And so the idea that something may be stored logically and that it may be stored physically, uh, are not necessarily a, we don't always benefit from synonymous there. I'm not suggesting that there isn't a material basis to the logical world, but that it does warrant a identification with the separate layer that need not invoke logic gates and Zeros and ones.

Speaker 1:          00:09:59       And, uh, so connecting those two worlds of the logical world and the physical world or maybe just connecting to the logical world inside of our brain. [inaudible] brain. You mentioned the idea of out

Speaker 2:          00:10:13       intelligence, artificial intelligence, artificial intelligence. Yes. This is the only essay that John Brockman ever invited me to write that he refused to publish an edge.

Speaker 1:          00:10:25       Why? Well, maybe it wasn't, it wasn't well written. Um, but I don't know. The idea is quite compelling is quite unique and new and for, at least from my view of Stan's point, maybe you can explain it. Sure.

Speaker 2:          00:10:39       What I was thinking about is why it is that we're waiting to be terrified by artificial general intelligence, when in fact, artificial life, uh, is terrifying in and of itself. And it's already here. So in order to have a system of selective pressures, you need three distinct elements. You need variation within a population. You need heritability and you need differential success. Okay. So what's really unique, and I've made this point, I think elsewhere about it, software, is that if you think about what humans know how to build, that's impressive. So I always take a car and I say, does it have an analog of each of the physical physiological systems? Does it have a skeletal structure? That's its frame. Does it have a n a neurological structure? It has an onboard computer, has a digestive system.

Speaker 2:          00:11:35       The one thing it doesn't have as a reproductive system, but if you can call spawn on a process, effectively, you do have a reproductive system. And that means that you can create something with variation, heritability, and differential success. Now the next step in the chain of thinking was, where do we see inanimate non-intelligent life? Outwitting intelligent life. And um, I have two favorite systems and I try to stay on them so that we don't get distracted. One of which is the Oh, freeze orchid, um, subspecies or sub clade, I don't know what to call it as a type of flower. Yeah. It's a type of flower that mimics the female of a pollinator species in order to dupe the males into, uh, engaging. It was called pseudo copulation with the fake female, which is usually represented by the lowest pedal. And there's also a fair amount component to fool the males and to thinking they have a mating opportunity, but the flower doesn't have to give up energy, energy in the form of nectar as a lower because it's tricking the males.

Speaker 2:          00:12:45       The other system is a particular species, uh, of muscle lamp bacillus in the clear streams of Missouri. And it fools bass into biting a fleshy lip that contain its young. And when the bass see this fleshy lip, which it looks exactly like a species of fish that the best like to eat the, uh, the young explode and clamp onto the gills and parasitize the bass. And also lose the best to redistribute them as they eventually release both of these systems. You have a highly intelligent duped being fooled by a lower life form. And what is sculpting these, these convincing Lewers, it's the intelligence of previously duped targets for these strategies. So when the target is smart enough to avoid the strategy, uh, those weaker mimics a fall off. They have terminal lines and only the better ones survive. So it's an arms race between the target species, uh, that is being parasitized getting smarter and this other less intelligent or not intelligent object getting as if smarter.

Speaker 2:          00:14:08       And so what you see is, is that artificial intelligence, artificial general intelligence is not needed to parasitize us. It's simply sufficient for us to outwit ourselves. So you could have a, a program, let's say, you know, one of these Nigerian scams, um, that writes letters and uses whoever sends it Bitcoin, uh, to figure out which aspects of the program should be kept, which should be varied and thrown away. And you don't need it to be in any way intelligent in order to have a really nightmare scenario of being parasitized by something that has no idea what it's doing. So you, you, you phrase it, if you guys have really eloquently, so let me try it to uh, as a few

Speaker 1:          00:14:51       directions. This goes. So one, four s first on the way we write software today, it's not common that we allow it to self modify what we do have that ability. Now we have the ability, it's just not common, isn't as common. So, so your, your thought is that that is a serious worry if there becomes a modifying code is, is available now. So there's different types of self modification, right? There's a personalization. You know, your email app, your Gmail is a self modifying to you after you log in or whatever. You can think of it that way. But ultimately it's central. All the information is centralized, but you're thinking of ideas where you're completely, so this isn't a unique entity, uh, operating under selective pressures and it changes. Well, you just, if you think about the fact that our immune systems don't know what's coming at them next, but they have a small set of spanning components, and if it's, if it's a sufficiently expressive system in that any shape, uh, or binding region can be approximated, uh, with, with the Lego that is present.

Speaker 1:          00:16:10       Um, then you can have confidence that you don't need to know what's coming at you because the common, a torics are sufficient to reach any configuration needed. Uh, so that's a beautiful thing. Well, terrifying thing to worry about because it's so within our reach, whatever I suggest these things, I do always have a concern as to whether or not I will bring them into being by talking about them. So, uh, there's this thing from open AI, so, uh, next next week. So talk to fonder of Openai, uh, this idea that a, their text generation, the new, uh, the new stuff they have for generating texts is they didn't want to bring it, they didn't want to release it because they're worried about the god. Delighted to hear that, but they're going to end up releasing. Yes. So that's the thing is I think talking about it. Um, well at least from my end, I'm more a proponent of Technology preventing techno, uh, so further innovation, preventing the detrimental effects of innovation. What were the, were sort of tumbling down a hill at accelerating speed. So whether or not we're proponents or it doesn't really mean it may not matter, but I do not. Well, I do feel that there are people who've held things back and, uh, you know, died poor than they might have otherwise been. We don't even know their names. I don't think that we should discount the idea that having the smartest people showing off how smart they are by what they've developed. Maybe a terminal

Speaker 2:          00:17:50       process. I'm, I'm very mindful in particular, have a beautiful letter that Edward Teller of all people wrote to Leo Szilard and whereas Szilard was trying to figure how to control the use of atomic weaponry at the end of World War II and teller rather strangely because many of us view him as a monster, um, showed some very advanced moral thinking, talking about the slim chance we have for survival. And that the only hope is to make Warren thinkable. I do think that not enough of us feel in our gut what it is we are playing with. When we were working on technical problems, and I would recommend to anyone who hasn't seen it, a movie called the bridge over the bridge on the river Kwai about I believe captured British POW [inaudible] who just in a desire to do a bridge well end up over collaborating with their Japanese cap.

Speaker 1:          00:18:43       Well now you're making me a question. The under strict it open discussion of ideas and AI.

Speaker 2:          00:18:51       I'm not saying I know the answer, I'm just saying that I could make a decent case for either our need to talk about this and to become technologically focused on containing it or need to stop talking about this and try to hope that the relatively small number of highly adept individuals who are looking at these problems is small enough that we should in fact be talking about how to contain them.

Speaker 1:          00:19:13       Well, the way ideas, the way innovation happens when new ideas develop a Newton with calculus, whether if, ah, he was silent, the idea would be, would emerge elsewhere in case Casey Newton of course. But, uh, you know, it went in case of AI, how small is the set of individuals out of which such ideas would arise

Speaker 2:          00:19:36       is it isn't one of the, the ideas that the researchers we know and those that we don't know who may live in countries that don't wish us to know what level they're currently at and very disciplined and keeping these, uh, things to themselves. Of course, I will point out that there is a religious school in Kerala that developed something very close to the calculus, certainly in terms of infinite series in, um, I guess religious prayer, uh, and, and uh, and Ryman pros. So, you know, it's not that Newton had any ability to hold that back and I don't really believe that we have an ability to hold it back. I do think that we could change the proportion of the time we spend worrying about the effects of what if we are successful rather than simply trying to succeed and hope that we'll be able to contain things later.

Speaker 1:          00:20:28       Beautifully put. So on the idea of intelligence, what form trading cautiously is we've agreed as we tumbled down the hill, uh, what happens is the upper cells, can we, we can, we cannot, uh, well formed. Do you, do you see it taking? So one example, Facebook, Google of it. We'll do one too. I don't know a better word. You want to influence users to behave a certain way. And so that's one kind of example of our intelligence is a systems perhaps modifying the behavior of their, the, these intelligent human beings in order to sell more product of different kinds. But do you see other examples of this actually emerging in just take any parasitic system? You know,

Speaker 2:          00:21:16       make sure that there's some way in which that there's differential success heritability and in variation and those are the magic ingredients. And if you really wanted to build a nightmare machine, makes sure that the system that expresses the variability, uh, has a spanning set so that it can learn to arbitrary levels, uh, by making it sufficiently expressive. That's your nightmare.

Speaker 1:          00:21:43       So it's your nightmare. But it could also be as, it's a really powerful mechanism by which to create well powerful systems. So are you more worried about the negative direction that might go versus the positive? So you say parasitic, but that doesn't necessarily need to be what the system converges towards. It could be a, what is it? They are a citizen.

Speaker 2:          00:22:08       The dividing line between parasitism and symbiosis

Speaker 1:          00:22:12       is not so clear. That's what they tell me about marriage. I'm still single, so I know. Well, um, yeah, I, we can go into that too, but no, I think we have to appreciate, you know, are, are you infected by your own Mitochondria? Right, right. Yeah.

Speaker 2:          00:22:35       So, you know, in marriage you fear the loss of independence. But even though the American, uh, therapeutic community may be very concerned about codependence, what's to say that codependence isn't what's necessary to have a stable relationship in which to raise children who are maximally case selected and require incredible amounts of care because you have to wait 13 years before there's any reproductive payout. And most of us don't want our 13 year olds having kids as a very tricky situation to analyze. I would say that, um, predators and parasites drive much of our evolution and I don't know whether to be angry at them or thank them.

Speaker 1:          00:23:13       Well, ultimately the, I mean nobody knows the meaning of life or what even happinesses, but uh, there is some metrics, but did she tell you they, they didn't. Uh, that's why all the poetry and books are about the, you know, there is some metrics under which you can kind of measure how good it is that these AI systems are roaming about. So you're more, you're more nervous about software, then you are optimistic about ideas of self replicating. I don't think we've really

Speaker 2:          00:23:46       felt where we are. You know, occasionally we get a wake up nine 11 was so anomalous compared to everything we've up, everything else we've experienced on American soil that it came to us as a complete shock that that was even a possibility. What it really was was a highly creative and determined r and d team deep in the bowels of Afghanistan. Um, showing us that we had certain exploits that were open to that nobody had chosen to express. I can think of several of these things that I don't talk about publicly that just seem to have to do with, um, how relatively unimaginative those who wished to cause havoc and destruction had been up until now. The great mystery of our time, of, of this particular little era is how remarkably stable we've been since 1945 when we demonstrated the ability to use a nuclear weapons in anger.

Speaker 2:          00:24:50       And we don't know why things like that haven't happened since then. We've had several close calls. We've had mistakes, we've had a brinksmanship. And what's now happened is that we've settled into a sense that, oh, it's, it'll always be nothing. It's been so long since something was at that level of danger that we've got a wrong idea in our head. And that's why when I went into the Ben Shapiro show, I talked about the need to resume above ground testing of nuclear devices because we have people whose developmental experience suggests that when, let's say Donald Trump and North Korea engage on Twitter, oh, it's nothing. It's just posturing. Everybody's just in it for money. There's there, there's a sense that people are in a video game mode, which has been the right call since 1945 we've been mostly in video game mode. It's amazing. So you're worried about a generation which is not seeing any existential, we've lived under it.

Speaker 2:          00:25:58       You see your younger, I don't know if if, uh, again you came from, from Moscow. Yeah. There was a, a TV show called the day after that had a huge effect, uh, on a generation, uh, growing up in the U s and it talked about what life would be like after a nuclear exchange. We have not gone through an embodied experience collectively where we've thought about this. And I think it's one of the most irresponsible things that the elders among us have done, which is to provide this beautiful garden in which the thorns are cut off of the, of the rose bushes and all of the edges are rounded and sanded. And so people have developed this, this totally unreal idea, which is everything's going to be just fine. And do I think that my leading concern is Agi or my leading concern is a thermonuclear exchange or gene drives or any one of these things?

Speaker 2:          00:27:04       I don't know. But I know that our time here in this very long experiment here is finite because the toys that we've built are so impressive and the wisdom to accompany them has not materialized. And I think we actually got a wisdom uptick since 1945 we had a lot of dangerous skilled players on the world stage. Nevertheless, no matter how bad they were managed to not embroil us in something that we couldn't come back from the Cold War and the distance from the Cold War. You know, I'm very mindful of, uh, there was a Russian tradition actually of on your wedding day going to visit a, a memorial to those who gave their lives. Can you imagine this, where you, you are the happiest day of your life. You go and you pay homage to the people who fought and died in the battle of Stalingrad. Um, I'm not a huge fan of communism, I gotta say, but there were a couple of things that the Russians did that were really positive and the Soviet era.

Speaker 2:          00:28:18       And I think trying to let people know how serious life actually is, is a, is the Russian model of seriousness is better than the American model. And maybe like you mentioned, there was a small echo of that after nine 11, but we would, we wouldn't let it form. We talk about nine 11, but it's nine 12 that really move the needle when we were all just there and nobody wanted to speak. We some, we witnessed something super serious and we didn't want to, uh, run to our computers and blast out our deep thoughts and our feelings. And it was profound because we woke up briefly there. You know, I talk about the gated institutional narrative and that sort of programs our lives, I've seen it break three times in my life. One of which was the election of Donald Trump. Another time was the fall of Lehman brothers when everybody who knew that bear Stearns wasn't that important, knew that Lehman brothers met AIG was next.

Speaker 2:          00:29:27       And the other one was nine 11. And so if I'm 53 years old, and I only remember three times that the, the global narrative was really interrupted. That tells you how much we've been on top of developing events. You know, I mean, we had the Moreau felt federal building explosion, but it didn't cause the narrative to break wasn't profound enough. Around nine 12, we started to wake up out of our slumber and the powers that be did not want to coming together. They, you know, the, the, the admonition was go shopping and uh, the powers that be was, what does that force as opposed to blaming individually, we don't know. So whatever that, whatever that force is, there's a component of it that's emergent and there's a component of it that's deliberate. So give yourself a portfolio with two components. Some amount of it is emergent, but some amount of it is also an understanding that if people come together, they become an incredible force.

Speaker 2:          00:30:27       And what you're seeing right now I think is there are forces that are trying to come together and there are forces that are trying to push things apart. And you know, one of them is the globalist narrative versus the national narrative where to the global, a globalist perspective, uh, the Nash nations are bad things in essence that they're temporary, they're nationalistic, they're jingoistic. It's all negative to people in the national, more in the national idiom, they're saying, look, this is where I pay my taxes. This is where I do my army service. This is where I have a vote. This is where I have a passport. Who the hell are you to tell me that? Because you've moved into someplace that you can make money globally, that you've chosen to abandon other people to whom you have a special and elevated duty. And I think that these competing narratives have been pushing towards the global perspective, uh, from the elite and a larger and larger number of disenfranchised people are saying, Hey, I actually live in a, in a place and I have laws and I speak a language.

Speaker 2:          00:31:31       I have a culture. And who are you to tell me that? Because you can profit in some far away land that my obligations to my fellow country, men are so, so much diminished. So these tensions in between nations and so on, ultimately you see being proud of your country and so on, which creates potentially the kind of things that led to wars and so on. They ultimately, it is human nature and it is good for us, uh, for wake up calls, a different kinds of, oh, I think that these are tensions. And my point isn't, I mean, nationalism, run a muck is a nightmare and internationalism run a muck is a nightmare. And the problem is we're trying to push these pendulums, uh, to some place where they're somewhat balanced, where we have a higher duty of care to those who share our log, our laws and our citizenship.

Speaker 2:          00:32:25       But we don't forget our duties of care to the global system. I would think this is elementary, but the problem that we're facing concerns the ability for some to profit the event by abandoning their obligations to others within their system. And that's what we've had for decades. He mentioned nuclear weapons. I was hoping to get answers from you since one of the many things you've done as a economics. It may be you can understand human behavior of why the heck we haven't, uh, blowing each other up yet, but, okay. So, uh, we'll get it. I know the answer. And you said it's a fast, it's really important to say that we really don't know. MILDEP up ticking wisdom, a mild uptake and wisdom. That's was Steven pig. Bingo is who I've talked with has a lot of really good ideas about why. But nobody, I don't trust his optimism.

Speaker 2:          00:33:22       Listen, I'm rushing, so I never trust the guy. Was that optimists? No, no, no, no. You're talking about a guy who's looking at a system in which more and more of the kinetic energy, like war has been turned into potential energy, like unused nuclear weapon. Beautifully put. And you know, now I'm looking at that system and I'm saying, okay, well if you don't have a potential energy term than everything's just getting better and better. Yeah. Wow. That's as beautifully put. Only physicists. Got It. Okay. Uh, not a physicist. Is that a dirty word? No, no. I wish I were a physicist. A me too. My Dad's a physicist. I'm trying to live up that probably for the rest of my life. He's probably going to listen to this too. So he did. Yeah. So your friend Sam Harris, uh, worries a lot about the existential threat of Ai, not in the way that you've described, but in the more well, he hangs out with Ilan.

Speaker 2:          00:34:18       I don't know. So are you worried about that kind of, uh, you know, about the, um, about either robotic systems or, you know, traditionally defined AI systems essentially becoming a superintelligent much more intelligent than human beings and, uh, getting what they already are and they're not, when, when seen as, um, a collective you mean? Well, I mean, I can mean all sorts of things, but certainly many of the things that we thought were peculiar to general intelligence or do not require general intelligence. So that's been one of the big awakenings that you can write a pretty convincing sports story from stats alone without needing to have watched the game. So, you know, is it possible to write lively pros about politics? Yeah, no, not yet. So we were sort of all over the map. One of the, one of the things about chest, you'll, there's a question I once asked on Quora that didn't get a lot of response, which was what is the greatest brilliancy ever produced by a computer and a chess game, which was different than the question of what is the greatest game ever played. So if you think about resiliencies is what really animates many of us to think of chest as an art form, those are those moves and combinations that just show such flare pinash and, and, and, and soul. Um, computers weren't really great at that. They were great positional monsters. And

Speaker 1:          00:35:54       you know, recently we, we've started seeing brilliancy and so you're grand masters have identified with that with Alpha zero that things were quite brilliant. Yeah. So that's great. That's it. That's it. You know, that's an example of something we don't think that that's Agi, but in a very restricted set, a set of rules like chess,

Speaker 2:          00:36:11       you're starting to see poetry of a high order and, and so I'm not, I don't like the idea that we're waiting for Agi. Agi is sort of slowly infiltrating our lives in the same way that I don't think a worm should be. You know, the sea elegans shouldn't be treated as nonconscious because it only has 300 neurons and maybe just has a very low level of consciousness because we don't understand what these things mean as they scale up. So am I worried about this general phenomena? Sure. But I think that one of the things that's happening is that a lot of us are fretting about this, uh, in part because of human needs. We've always been worried about the Gollum, right?

Speaker 1:          00:36:57       Well, the gums, the artificially created life, you know, it's like Frankenstein. Yeah, sure. It's a Jewish version

Speaker 2:          00:37:04       and um, Frankenberg Frankenstein. That's makes sense. All right, so the, uh, but we've always been worried about creating something like this and it's getting closer and closer and there are ways in which we have to realize that the whole thing has come up with a whole thing that we've experienced are the context of our lives is almost certainly coming to an end. And I don't mean to suggest that, uh, we won't survive. I don't know. And I don't mean to suggest that it's coming tomorrow and it could be 300, 500 years, but there's no plan that I'm aware of. If we have three rocks that we could possibly inhabit that are sensible within current technological dreams, the earth, the moon and Mars, and we have a very competitive civilization that is still forced into violence to sort out disputes that cannot be arbitrated. It is not clear to me that we have a longterm future until we get to the next stage, which is to figure out whether or not the Einsteinian speed limit can be broken. And that requires our source code,

Speaker 1:          00:38:21       our source code, the stuff in our brains to figure out what, what do you mean by our source code? The source code of the context, whatever it is that produces the corks, the electrons, the Neutrino I, our source code. I got it. So this is like, like you're talking to your best stuff

Speaker 2:          00:38:36       that's written in a higher level language. Yeah. If his right, you're talking about the low level, uh, the bits, that's what is currently keeping us here. We can't even imagine, you know, we have harebrained schemes for staying within the Einsteinian speed limit. Uh, you know, maybe if we could just drug ourselves and go into a suspended state or we could have multiple generations, I think all that stuff is pretty silly. But I think it's also pretty silly to imagine that our wisdom is going to increase to the point that we can have the toys we have and uh, we're not going to use them for 500 years. Speaking of Einstein, I had a profound break that when I realized you're just one letter away from the guy, but I'm also one letter away from Feinstein. It's, well, you get to pick. Okay. So unified theory, you know, you've worked a, you, you enjoy the beauty of geometry.

Speaker 2:          00:39:32       I don't actually know if you enjoy it. You certainly are quite good at is Trumbull before tremble before it is that if you are religious, that is one of the good, I have to be religious. It's just so beautiful. You will tremble anyway. I mean, I just read to Einstein's biography and one of the ways, one of the things you've done is tried to explore a, a unified theory, uh, talking about a 14 dimensional opposite verse that has the four d space time continuum embedded in it. I just curious how you think and how it philosophically at a high level about something more than four dimensions. Uh, how do you try to, what does it make you feel talking in the mathematical world about dimensions that are greater than the ones we can perceive is, is there something that you take away that's more than just the math? Well, first of all, stick out your tongue at me.

Speaker 2:          00:40:32       Okay. Now on the front of that time, yeah, there was a sweet receptor and next to that we're salt receptors and two different sides. A little bit farther back, there were sour receptors and you wouldn't show me the back of your tongue where you're bitter receptor was show the good side always. Okay. But that was four dimensions of taste receptors. But you also had pain receptors on the tongue and probably heat receptors on that time. So let's assume that you had one of each, that would be six dimensions. So when you eat something, you eat a slice of pizza and it's got some, some uh, some hot pepper on it, maybe some Jalapeno, you're having a six dimensional experience. Dude, do you think we overemphasize the value of time as one of the dimensions or space? What we certainly over emphasize the value of time cause we like things to start and end or we really don't like things to end, but they seem to, well, what if you flipped one of the spatial into being a temporal dimension and you and I were to meet in New York City and say, well were where and when should we meet and say, how about I'll meet you on 36th and Lexington at two in the afternoon and uh, 11 o'clock in the morning.

Speaker 2:          00:41:53       That would be very confusing. Well, so it's a convenient for us to think about Tommy, you mean? All right. We happened to be in a delicious situation in which we have three dimensions of space and one of time and they're woven together in this sort of strange fabric where we can trade off a little space for a little time, but we still only have one dimension that is picked out relative to the other three. It's very much Gladys knight and the pips,

Speaker 1:          00:42:15       so which one developed for who do we develop for these dimensions or did the dimensions or were they always there and it doesn't?

Speaker 2:          00:42:23       Well, do you imagine that there isn't a place where there are four temporal dimensions or two and to have space and time or three of time in one of space and then with time not be playing the role of space. Why do you imagine that the sector that you're in is all that there is?

Speaker 1:          00:42:37       I certainly do not, but I can't imagine otherwise. I mean I haven't done Iowasca or any, any of those drugs that hope to one day, but so doing Iowasca you could just head over to building too. That's where the mathematicians are. Yeah. That's where they hang. Just to look at some geometry. We'll just ask about pseudo Romani and geometry. That's what you're interested in. Okay. Or You can talk to a Sharma and then ended up in Peru and then it's an extra money for that. You won't be able to do any calculations if that's how you choose to go about it. Well, a different kind of calculation so to speak. Yeah. One of my favorite people, Edward Frankl, Berkeley professor, author of love and math, great title for a book, uh, said uh, that your quite a remarkable intellect to come up with such beautiful original ideas in terms of the unified theory and so on, but you are working outside academia. So one question in developing ideas that truly original, truly interesting. What's the difference between inside academia and outside academia when it comes to developing such a terrible choice?

Speaker 2:          00:43:41       Terrible choice. So if you do it inside of academics, you are forced to constantly show great loyalty to the consensus and you distinguish yourself with small, almost microscopic heresies, uh, to make your reputation in general. And you have very competent people and brilliant people who are working together who are form very deep social networks and have a very high level of behavior, at least within mathematics and at least technically within physics, theoretical physics. When you go outside you beat lunatics and crazy people madmen. And these are people who do not usually subscribe to the consensus position and almost always lose their way. And the key question is, will progress likely come from someone who is miraculously managed to stay within the system and is able to take on a larger amount of heresy that is sort of unthinkable, uh, in which case that will be fascinating.

Speaker 2:          00:45:04       Or is it more likely that somebody will maintain a level of discipline from outside of academics and be able to make use of the freedom that comes from not having to constantly affirm your loyalty to the consensus of your field? So you've characterized in ways that I could, academia in this particular sense is a declining, you are posted a plot. The older population of the faculty's getting larger, the younger is getting smaller and so on. So what's, which direction of the two are you more hopeful about? Well, the baby boomers can't hang on forever. Was it first of all in general, true. And second of all in academia. But that's really what I think what this time is about is the baby boomers. We didn't, we're, we're used to like financial bubbles that lasts a few years in length and then pop the baby boomer bubble is this really long lived thing and all of the ideology, all of the behavior patterns, the norms, you know, for example, string theory is and almost entirely baby boomer phenomenon.

Speaker 2:          00:46:11       It was something that baby boomers were able to do because it required a very high level of mathematical ability. You don't, you don't think of a strength theory as a, an original idea. Oh, I mean it was original to Veneziano would probably is older than the baby boomers and there are people who are younger than the baby boomers who are still doing string theory. And I'm not saying that nothing discovered within the large string theoretic complex is wrong. Quite the contrary. A lot of brilliant mathematics and a lot of the structure of physics was elucidated by string theorists. What do I think of the deliverable nature of this product that will not ship called string theory? I think that it is largely an affirmative action program for highly mathematically and geometrically talented baby boomer physics physicists so that they can say that they're working on something within the constraints of what they will say is quantum gravity.

Speaker 2:          00:47:10       Now there are other schemes, you know, there's like ask them Todrick safety. There are other things that you could imagine doing. I don't think much of any of the major programs, but to have inflicted this level of loyalty through a Shibboleth. Well, surely you don't question y question almost everything in the string program, and that's why I got out of physics when you called me a physicist. It was a great honor, but the reason I didn't become a physicist wasn't that I fell in love with mathematics. As I said. Wow. In 1984, 1983, I saw the field going mad and I saw that mathematics, which has all sorts of problems, was not going insane. And so instead of studying things within physics, I thought it was much safer to study the same objects within mathematics. And there's a huge price to pay for that. You lose physical intuition.

Speaker 2:          00:48:03       But the point is, is that it wasn't a North Korean reeducation camp either. Are you hopeful about cracking open the Einstein unified theory in a way that has been really, really, uh, understanding whether a uniting everything together with content Tyrian so on. I mean I'm trying to play this role myself to do it well if you the extent of handing it over to the more responsible, more professional, more competent community. Um, so I think that they're wrong about a great number of their belief structures, but I do believe, I mean I have a really profound love hate relationship with this group of people. I think the physics side, Oh yeah. Because the mathematician is actually seem to be much more open minded and uh, well they are and there aren't, they're open minded but anything that looks like great math, right? Right. They'll study something that isn't very important physics, but if it's beautiful mathematics then they'll have uh, they have great intuition about these things.

Speaker 2:          00:49:06       As good as the mathematicians are. And I might even intellectually at some horsepower level, give them the edge. The theoretics theoretical physics community is bar none. The most profound intellectual community that we have ever created. It is the number one, there is nobody in second place as far as I concerned, look in their spare time and the spare time they invented molecular biology. What, what was the origin of molecular biology? You're saying Phil? Somebody like Francis Crick. I mean a lot, a lot of the early molecular biologists or physicists. Yeah, I mean, you know, Schrodinger wrote what is life and that was highly inspirational. I mean you have to appreciate that there is no community like the basic research community in theoretical physics. And it's not something I'm highly critical of these guys. I think that they would just wasted, you know, decades of time with, um, and your religious devotion to their misconceptions, realization of where the problems were in physics.

Speaker 2:          00:50:13       But this has been the greatest intellectual collapse ever witnessed within academics. You see it as a collapse or just a little, oh, I'm terrified that we're about to lose the vitality. We can't afford to pay these people. Um, we can't afford to give them an accelerator just to play with in case they find something at the next energy level. These people created our economy. They gave us the Rad lab and radar. They gave us two atomic devices to end World War II. They created the semiconductor and the transistor to power our economy through Moore's law. Uh, as a positive externality of particle accelerators. They created the worldwide web. And we have the insolence to say, why should we fund you with our tax payer dollars? No. The question is, are you enjoying your physics dollars? Right? We, these guys signed the world's worst licensing agreement. Right? And if, if they simply charged for every time you used a transistor or a URL a or enjoyed the piece that they have provided, um, during this period of time, through the terrible weapons that they developed, uh, or your communications devices, all of the things that power our economy, I really think came out of physics.

Speaker 2:          00:51:33       Even to the extent the chemistry came out of physics and molecular biology came out of physics. So first of all, you have to know that I'm very critical of this community. Second of all, it is our most important community. We have neglected it, we've abused it, we don't take it seriously. We don't even care to get them to rehab after a couple of generations of failure, right? No one, I think the youngest person to have really contributed to the standard model of theater medical level was born in 1951 right? Frank, we'll check and almost nothing has happened, um, that in theoretical physics after 1973 74 that sent somebody to Stockholm for theoretical development, that predicted experiment. So we have to understand that we are doing this to ourselves. Now with that said, these guys have behaved abysmally in my opinion, um, because they haven't owned up to where they actually are, what problems they're really facing, how definite they can actually be.

Speaker 2:          00:52:37       They haven't shared some of their most brilliant discoveries which are desperately needed in other fields like gauge theory, which at least the mathematicians can can share, which is an upgrade of the differential calculus of Newton in live nuts and they haven't shared the importance of renormalization theory. Uh, even though this should be standard operating procedure for people across the sciences, dealing with different layers and different levels of phenomenon. So shared, you mean communicated in such a way that a dis disseminates throughout the different of these guys are sitting, both theoretical physicists and mathematicians are sitting on top of a giant stockpile of intellectual gold, right? They have so many things that have not been manifested anywhere. I was just on Twitter, I think I mentioned the Habermann switch pitch that shows the self duality of the tetrahedron realized as a linkage mechanism. No, this is like a triviality and it makes an amazing toy that's, you know, built a market.

Speaker 2:          00:53:36       Hopefully a fortune for chuck Hoberman. Well, you have no idea how much great stuff that these priests have in their monastery. So it's truly a love and hate relationship for you. Well, it sounds like it's more on the love this building that we're in right here. Yes. Uh, is the building in which I really put together the conspiracy between the National Academy of Sciences and the National Science Foundation through the government university industry research round table to destroy the bargaining power of American academics, uh, using foreign labor with a on microfiche and not in the base. Oh yeah. That was done here in this building. Isn't that weird? And I'm truly speaking with a revolutionary and radical a, I don't know. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. At an intellectual level, yes, I am absolutely garden variety. I'm just straight down the middle. The system that we are in this, this university is functionally insane.

Speaker 2:          00:54:33       Yeah. Harvard is functionally insane and we don't understand that when we get these things wrong, the financial crisis made this very clear. There was a long period where every grown up, everybody with a tie, uh, who spoken in bear baritone tones, uh, with, with the right degree, uh, at the end of their name. Yeah. Uh, talking about how we banish volunteer volatility, we're in the great moderation. Okay. They were all crazy. And who was, who was right? It was like Nassim Taleb Nouriel Roubini. Now what happens is, is that they claimed the market went, went crazy, but the market didn't go crazy. The market had been crazy. And what happened is, is that it suddenly went sane. Well, that's where we are with academics. Academics right now is mad as a hatter and it's absolutely evident. I can show you graph after graph. I can show you the internal discussions.

Speaker 2:          00:55:28       I can show you the conspiracies. Harvard's dealing with one right now over a its admissions policies for people of Color, uh, who happened to come from Asia. All of this madness is necessary to keep the game going. What we're talking about, just while we're on the topic of revolutionaries, as we're talking about the danger of an outbreak of sanity, yeah. You're, you're the guy pointing out the elephant in the room here and the elephant has no clothes. Is that how that goes? I was going to talk a little bit to, uh, uh, Joe Rogan about this man at a time, but I think you're, you have some, you can just listen to you. You could probably speak really eloquently to academia on the differences between the different fields. So you think there's a difference between science and engineering and then the humanities in academia in terms of tolerance that they're willing to tolerate.

Speaker 2:          00:56:25       So from my perspective, I thought computer science and maybe engineering is more tolerant to radical ideas, but that's perhaps innocent of me is that I always, you know, all the battles going on now or a little bit more on the humanity side and gender studies and so on. Have you seen the, uh, American Mathematical Society is publication of an essay called get out the way? I have not. What's, what's the idea is that white men who hold positions within universities and mathematics should vacate their position so that young black women can take over something like this. That's in terms of diversity, which I also want to ask you about. But in terms of diversity of strictly ideas, I'm sure. Do you think, cause you're basically saying physics as a community has become a little bit intolerant to some degree to new radical ideas or at least you, uh, you said that's changed a little bit recently, which is that even string theory is now admitting, okay, we don't, this doesn't look very promising in the short term.

Speaker 2:          00:57:32       Right? So the question is what compiles, if you want to take the computer science metaphor, what will get you into a journal? Will you spend your life trying to push some paper into a journal or will it be accepted easily? What do we know about the characteristics of the submitter and what gets taken up and what does not? All of these fields are experiencing pressure because no field is performing so brilliantly? Well, um, that it's revolutionizing our way of speaking and thinking in the ways in which we've become accustomed. But don't you think even in theoretical physics, a lot of times, even with theories, extinct theory, you could speak to this. It does eventually too. What are the ways that this theory would be testable? And so ultimately, although look, there's this thing about popper and the scientific method that's a cancer and a disease in the minds of very smart people.

Speaker 2:          00:58:36       That's not really how most of the stuff gets worked out. It's how it gets checked, right? So, and there is a dialogue between theory and experiment, but everybody should read. Paul Directs 1963 American scientific American article where he, he, you know, it's very interesting, he talks about it as if it was about the Schrodinger equation and Schrodinger's failure to advances on work because of his failure to account for some phenomenon. And the key point is that if your theory is a slight bit off, it won't agree with experiment, but it doesn't mean that the theory is actually wrong. But direct could as easily have been talking about his own equation in which he predicted that the electrons should have an anti. And since the only positively charged particle that was known at the time was the Proton Heisenberg pointed out, well it shouldn't, you're anti particle, the Proton have the same mass as the electronic.

Speaker 2:          00:59:31       Doesn't that invalidate your theory? So I think the direct was actually being quite potentially quite sneaky. Um, and uh, talking about the fact that he had been pushed off of his own theory to some extent by Heisenberg. Um, but look, we fetishize the scientific method and popper and falsification, um, because it protects us from crazy ideas entering the field. So, you know, it's a question of balancing type one and type two error and we're pretty, we were pretty maxed out in one direction. The opposite of that. The, let me say what comforts me sort of biology or engineering, uh, at the end of the day does the thing work? Yeah. You can not test the crazies away. The crazy eight. We'll see. Now you're saying, but some ideas actually crazy and some are are actually correct. So, well there's pre correct. Currently crazy. Yeah. Right. And so you, you don't want to get rid of everybody who's pre correct.

Speaker 2:          01:00:28       And currently crazy. Um, the problem is, is that we don't have standards in general for trying to determine who has to be put to the sword in terms of their career and who has to be protected, uh, as some sort of giant time suck pain in the ass, uh, who may change everything. Do you think that's possible? Uh, creating a mechanism of those select well, you're not going to like the answer, but here it comes. Boy, it has to do with very human elements. We're trying to do this at the level of like rules and fairness. It's not going to work because the only thing that really understands this, you're read the read the double helix. It's a book. Oh, you have to read this book. Not only did Jim Watson, uh ha half discover this three dimensional structure. DNA is also one hell of a writer before he became an ass that no, he, yeah, he's tried to destroy his own reputation and you bought the asset.

Speaker 2:          01:01:30       Didn't know about the good writer. Jim Watson is one of the most important people now living. And, uh, as I've said before, Jim Watson is too important a legacy to be left to Jim Watson. Um, that book tells you more about what actually moves the dial. And there's another story about him, which I don't, I don't agree with, which is that he stole everything from Rosalind Franklin. I mean, the, the problems that he had with Rosalind Franklin are real, but we should actually honor that tension in our history by delving into it rather than having a simple solution. Jim Watson talks about Francis Crick being a pain in the ass, that everybody is secretly knew it was super brilliant and there's an encounter between a charge f, uh, who came up with the equimolar relations between the nucleotides who should have gotten the structure of DNA and Watson and Crick. And you know, he's talks about missing a shiver in the heartbeat of biology.

Speaker 2:          01:02:30       And this stuff is so gorgeous and just makes you tremble even thinking about it. Um, look, we know very often who is to be feared and we need to fund the people that we fear. The people who are wasting our time need to be excluded from the conversation you see. And you know, maybe we'll make some errors in both directions, but we have known our own people. We know the pains in the asses that might work out. And we know that people who are really just blow hards are really have very little to contribute. Most of the time. It's not 100%, but you're not going to get there with rules.

Speaker 1:          01:03:10       Right? It's a using some kind of instinct. I mean, I, to be honest, I'm going to make you roll your eyes for a second. But uh, and the first time I heard that there is a large community of people who believe the earth is flat.

Speaker 2:          01:03:23       Okay.

Speaker 1:          01:03:23       Actually made me pause and ask myself the question, why would there be such a community? Yeah. Is it possible the earth is flat? So I had to like, wait a minute. I mean, then you go through a thinking process that I think is really healthy. Uh, it ultimately ends up being a geometry thing. I think. Uh, it's an interesting, it's an interesting thought experiment at the very least.

Speaker 2:          01:03:44       Well I do a different version of it. I say, why is this community stable? Yeah, that's a good a way to analyze it. What interesting that whatever we've done has not erased the community. So you know, they're taking a long shot bet that won't pan out. You know, maybe we just haven't thought enough about the rationality of the square root of two and somebody's brilliant, we'll figure it out. Maybe we will eventually land one day on the surface of Jupiter and explore it. Right. These are crazy things that will never happen

Speaker 1:          01:04:14       so much as social media operates by Ai Algorithms. He's talked about this a little bit, uh, recommending the content you see. So on this idea of radical thought, how much should AI show you things you disagree with on Twitter and so on,

Speaker 2:          01:04:30       in, in a Twitter war verse in the departments in this quest? Yeah. Yeah. Cause you don't know the answer. No, no, no, no. Look, we've been, they've pushed out this cognitive Lego to us that will just lead to madness. It's good to be challenged with things that you disagree with. The answer is no. It's good to be challenged with interesting things with which you currently disagree. But that might be true. So I don't really care about whether or not I disagree with something or don't disagree. I need to know why that particular disagreeable thing is being pushed out. Is it because it's likely to be true? Is it because, is there some reason? Because I can write, I can write a computer generator, uh, to come up with an infinite number of disagreeable statements that nobody needs to look. So please, before you push things at me that w or disagreeable, tell me why there is an aspect in which that question is, is quite dumb, especially because it's being used to, uh, almost, um, uh, very generically by these different networks to say, well, we're trying to work this out.

Speaker 2:          01:05:35       But you know, basically, uh, how much do you see the value of seeing things you don't like, not you disagree with because very difficult to know exactly what you articulated, which is the stuff that's important for you to consider that you disagree with it. That's really hard to figure out. The bottom line is this stuff you don't like. If you are a Hillary Clinton supporter, you may not want to, it might not make you feel good to see anything about Donald Trump. That's the only thing algorithms can really optimize for currently. It really nothing they can do better. This is where we're, we're thinking. So now we're engaged in some more ronic back and forth where I have no idea why people who are capable of building Google, Facebook, Twitter, or having us in these incredibly low level discussions, do they not know any smart people? Do they not have the phone numbers of people who can elevate these discussions?

Speaker 2:          01:06:36       They do. But this awesome idea for a different thing. And they're pushing those people out of those rumors there. They're optimizing for things we can't see. And yes, profit is there. No. But it, nobody's questioning that. But they're also optimizing for things like political control or the fact that they're doing business in Pakistan and so they don't want to talk about all the things that they're going to be bending to in Pakistan. So we're, we're involved in a fake discussion. You think so you think these conversations at that depth, they're happening inside Google. You don't think they have some basic metrics under user engagements. You're having a fake conversation with us guys. We know you're having a fake conversation. I do not wish to be part of your fake conversation. You know how to cool these units. You know, high availability, like nobody's business. My Gmail never goes down almost.

Speaker 2:          01:07:33       So you think just because they can do incredible work on the software side with infrastructure, they can also deal with some of these difficult questions about human behavior, human understanding. You're not, I mean I've seen the, I've seen the developer's screens that people take shots of inside of Google. Yeah. And I've heard stories inside of Facebook and apple. We're not, we're engaged. They're engaging us in the wrong conversations. We're not at this low level. Here's one of my favorite questions. Why is every piece of hardware that I purchased in, in, in tech space equipped as a listening, we're, where's my physical shutter to cover my lens? We had this in the 1970s it cameras that had blends caps, you know, how much would it cost to have a security model pay five extra bucks. Why is my indicator light software controlled? Why when my camera is on, do I not see that the light is on by putting it as a something that cannot be bypassed, why have you set up my, all of my devices at some difficulty to yourselves as listening devices and we don't even talk about this, this, this, this, this thing is total fucking bullshit.

Speaker 2:          01:08:51       Well, I, these discussions are happening about privacy. This is there a dif more difficult than you'd give them. It's not just privacy, it's about social control. We're talking about social control. Why do I not have controls over my own levers? Just have a really cute UI where I can switch. I can dial things where I can at least see what the algorithms are. You think that there is some deliberate choices being made? Here is emergence and there is a intention. There's two dimensions. The vector does not collapse onto either access, but the idea that anybody who suggests that intention is completely absent is a child that's really beautifully put and uh, like many things you've said is going to make me, can I trust, can I turn this around slightly? Yeah. I sit down with you and you say that you're obsessed with my feet. [inaudible]

Speaker 2:          01:09:45       I didn't even know what my feed is. What are you seeing that I'm not, I was obsessive Lee, looking through your feed a on Twitter because it was really enjoyable because it was the Tom Layer element. Does the humor in it. By the way, that feed is Eric r Weinstein on Twitter at Greg. Eric r Weinstein. It. No, seriously. Why? Why did I find it enjoyable or what it was I seeing? What are you, what are you looking for? Why are we doing this? What does this podcast about? I know you've got all these interesting people. I'm just some guy who is sort of a podcast guest sort of access. You're not even wearing a tie. I mean, not even wearing I on a serious interview, uh, uh, searching for meaning for happiness, for a dopamine rush. So short term and long term. And how are you finding your way to me?

Speaker 2:          01:10:35       What it, what, what, what is I, I don't honestly know what I'm doing to reach you. The representing ideas, which are feel common sense to me and not many people are speaking. So it's Kinda like the dog, the intellectual dark web folks, right? Uh, they s these folks from Sam Harris, the Jordan Peterson to yourself are saying things where it's like, you're like saying, look, there's an elephant and he's not wearing any clothes. And I say, yeah, yeah. Well let's have more of that conversation. That's how I'm finding you. I'm desperate to try to, the conversation we're having, I'm very worried. We've got an election in 2020. I don't think we can afford four more years of a misinterpreted message. Um, which is what Donald Trump was. And I don't want the destruction of our institutions. They all seem hell bent on destroying themselves. So I'm trying to save theoretical physics. Trying to save the New York Times is trying to save are various processes. And I think it feels delusional to me that, uh, cause this is falling to a tiny group of people who are willing to speak out without getting so freaked out that everything they say it will be misinterpreted and that their lives will be ruined through the process. I mean, I think we're in an absolutely bananas period of time and I don't believe it should fall to such a tiny number of, of shoulders to shoulder this weight. So

Speaker 3:          01:12:03       I have to ask you on a capitalism side, you mentioned that technology's killing capitalism. It has effects that are unintended, well, not unintended, but, uh, not what economists would predict or speak of capitalism creating. Uh, I just want to talk to you about in general, the effect of even then artificial intelligence or technology automation, taking away jobs in these kinds of things in what you think is the way to alleviate that, whether the Andrew Ang presidential candidate with universal basic income ubi. What are your thoughts there? How do we fight off the negative effects of technology? That all right.

Speaker 2:          01:12:42       Software Guy, right? Yup. A human being is a worker is an old idea. Yes. Human being has a worker is a different object, right? Yeah. So if you think about object oriented programming is a paradigm. A human being has a worker and a human being has a soul. We're talking about the fact that for a period of time, the worker that a human being has yeah. Was in a position to feed the soul that a human being has. However, we have two separate claims on the value in society. One is as a worker and the other is as a soul and the soul needs sustenance. It needs dignity. It needs meaning. It needs purpose. Okay. As long as you're means of support is not highly repetitive. I think you have a while to go before you need to start worrying. But if what you do is highly repetitive and it's not terribly generative, you weren't in the cross hairs of four for loops and while loops, and that's what computers excel at repetitive behavior.

Speaker 2:          01:13:48       And when I say repetitive, I mean meat. I may mean things that have never happened be through common tutorial possibilities. But as long as it has a looped characteristic to it, you're in trouble. We are seeing a massive push towards socialism because capitalists are slow to address the fact that a worker may not be able to make claims. A relatively undistinguished median member of our society is still has needs to reproduce, needs to ha to dignity. And when capitalism abandons the median individual or you know, the, the bottom 10th or whatever it, it's going to do, it's flirting with revolution. And what concerns me is that the capitalists aren't sufficiently capitalistic to understand this. You really want to court a authoritarian control in our society because you can't see that people may not be able to defend themselves in the marketplace because the marginal product of their labor w two s to low to feed their dignity as a soul.

Speaker 2:          01:14:55       So it, my great concern is that our free society has to do with the fact that we are self organized. I remember looking down from my office in Manhattan when Lehman Brothers collapsed and thinking, who's going to tell all these people that they need to show up at work when they don't have a financial system to incentivize them to show up at work. So my complaint is first of all, not with the Socialists but with the capitalists, which is you guys are being idiots. You're courting revolution by continuing to harp on the same old ideas that well, you know, try, try harder. Bootstrap yourself. Yeah, to an extent that works to an extent, but we are clearly headed in place that there's nothing that ties together our need to contribute and our need to consume. And that may not be provided by capitalism because it may have been a temporary phenomena.

Speaker 2:          01:15:49       So check out my article on anthropic capitalism and the new gimmick economy. Uh, I think people are late getting the wake up call and we would be doing a better job saving capitalism from itself. Um, because I don't want this done under authoritarian control. And the more we insist that, uh, everybody who's not thriving in our society during their reproductive years in order to have a family is failing at a personal level. I mean, what a disgusting thing that we're saying. What a, what a horrible message. Who To, who the hell have we become that we've so bought into the Chicago model, um, that we can't see the humanity that we're destroying in that process. And it's, I hate, I hate the thought of communism. I really do. My family has flirted with it decades past. It's a wrong, bad idea, but we are going to need to figure out how to make sure that those souls are nourished, nourished, and respected and capitalism better have an answer. And I'm betting on capitalism, but I gotta tell you, I'm pretty disappointed with my team. So you're still on the capitalism team. Just a, there's a theme here. Restful, radical capitalism. Capitalism. Yeah. I want, I think hyper capitalism is going to have to be cup coupled to hyper socialism. You need to allow the most productive people to create wonders and you've got to stop bogging them down with all of these extra nice requirements, you know, nicest dead good. Has a future. Nice. Doesn't have a future because nice ends up with, with Goulet eggs.

Speaker 3:          01:17:19       Damn, that's a good line. Okay, last question. You a tweeted today, a simple, quite insightful equation saying a imagine that every unit f, uh, fame you picked up as stalkers and h haters. So I imagine acid h are dependent on your path to fame, perhaps.

Speaker 2:          01:17:39       Well, it's not as simple and people always take these things literally when you have like 280 characters to explain yourself as emia there. That's not a mathematical, uh, no, there's no law. Oh, okay. All right. I just said, why I put the word imagine, because I haven't slept with mathematicians. Desire for precision. Yeah. Imagine that this were true,

Speaker 3:          01:17:57       but it was a beautiful way to imagine that there is a law that has those variables in it. And uh, you've become quite famous these days. So how do you yourself optimize that equation with the peculiar kind of fame that you have gathered along the way?

Speaker 2:          01:18:13       I want to be kinder. I want to be kinder to myself. I want to be kinder to others. I want to be able to have heart compassionate. These things are really important. And uh, I have a pretty spectrum. He kind of approach to analysis. I'm quite literal. I can go full rain man on you at any given moment. No. I can, yeah. Can, uh, it's faculty to have autism if you like. And people are gonna get angry because they want autism to be respected. But yes, when you see me coding or you see me doing mathematics, I am, you know, I speak with speech apnea me right down to dinner, you know? Yeah. We have to try to integrate ourselves. And those tensions between, you know, it's sort of back to the US as a worker and us as a soul. Many of us are optimizing one to the, at the expense of the other.

Speaker 2:          01:19:05       And I struggle with social media and I struggle with people making threats against, uh, our families. And I struggle with, um, just how much pain people are in. And if there's one message I would like to push out there, um, irresponsible. Everybody, all of us, myself included, with struggling struggle, struggle mightily because you, it's nobody else's job to do your struggle for you. Now with that said, if you're struggling and you're trying and you're trying to figure out how to better yourself and where you failed and where you've let down and your family, your friends, your worker is all this kind of stuff, give yourself a break. You know, if, if, if it's not working out, I have a lifelong relationship with failure and success. There's been no period of my life. We're both haven't been present in one form or another. And

Speaker 2:          01:19:56       I, I do wish to say that a lot of times people think this is glamorous. I'm about to go do a show with Sam Harris. People are going to listen in on two guys having a conversation on. It's completely crazy when I'm always trying to figure out how to make sure that those people get maximum value. And, uh, and that's why I'm doing this podcast. You know, just give yourself a break. You owe us, you owe us your struggle. You don't owe your family or your coworkers or your lovers or your family members' success. Um, as long as you're in there and you're picking yourself up, recognize that this, this new situation with the economy that doesn't have the juice to sustain our institutions has caused the people who have risen to the top of those institutions to get quite brutal and cruel. Everybody's lying at the moment.

Speaker 2:          01:20:45       Nobody's really a truth teller. Um, try to keep your humanity about you. Try to recognize that if you're failing, if things aren't where you want them to be and you're struggling and you're trying to figure out what you're doing wrong, which you could do, it's not necessarily all your fault. We are in a global situation. I have not met the people who are honest, kind, good, successful. Nobody that I've met is chick is checking all the boxes. Uh, nobody's getting all tens. So I just think that's an important message that doesn't get pushed out enough. Either. People want to hold society responsible for their failures, which is not reasonable. You have to struggle. You have to try, uh, or they want to say you're 100% responsible for your failures, which is total nonsense. Beautifully put. Eric, thanks so much for talking today. Thanks for having me, buddy.
