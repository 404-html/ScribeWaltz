Speaker 1:          00:00          Today we have sterling Anderson is the cofounder of Aurora and exciting new self driving car company. Previously he was the head of the Tesla autopilot team that brought both the first and second generation autopilot to life. Before that he did his phd at Mit, working on shared humor, machine control of ground vehicles, the very thing I've been harping on over and over in this class, and now he's back at mit to talk with us. Please give him a warm welcome.

Speaker 2:          00:36          Thank you. It's good to be here. I was telling Lex just before, I think it's been a little while since I've been back to the institute and so great to be here. I want to apologize in advance. I've just landed this afternoon from Korea via Germany where I've been spending the last week and so I may speak a little slower than normal. Please bear with me if I become incoherent or a slur, my speech, somebody flag it too and we'll uh, we'll try to make corrections. So tonight I thought I'd chat with you a little bit about my journey over the last decade span, just over 10 years since I was at mit. A lot has changed, a lot has changed for the better in the self driving community and I've been privileged to be a part of many of those changes and so on at the time with you, a little bit about some of the things that I've learned, some of the things that I've experienced and then maybe end by talking about sort of where we go from here and what the next steps are both for the industry at large, but also for the company that we're building that Alex mentioned is called Aurora to start out with.

Speaker 2:          01:40          There are a few sort of key phases or transitions in my journey over the last 10 years. As I mentioned when I started at Mit, I worked with Carl Yani, Mr Amelio for Zalia, John Leonard, a few others on some of these sort of shared adaptive automation approaches. Um, I'll talk a little bit about those from there. I spent some time at Tesla where I first sled the model x program as we both finished the development and ultimately launched it, took over the autopilot program where we introduce a number of new, both active safety, but also sort of enhanced convenience features from autosteer to debit cruise control that we're able to refine a few unique ways and we'll talk a little bit about that and then from there in December of last year of 2016, I guess now we started a new company called Aurora and I'll tell you a little bit about that.

Speaker 2:          02:42          So to start out with, when I came, no, it was 2007. The Darpa urban challenges were well underway at that stage and one of the things that we wanted to do is find a way to address some of these safety issues in human driving earlier. Then potentially full cell driving could do and so we developed what became known as the intelligent copilot. What you see here is a simulation of that operating. I'll tell you a little bit more about that in just a second, but to explain a little bit about the methodology. The innovation, the key approach that we took there was slightly different from what a traditional planning control theory, which we were doing was instead of designing in path space, uh, for the robot, we instead a found a way to identify a plan, optimize and design a controller subject to a set of constraints rather than paths.

Speaker 2:          03:38          And so what we're doing is looking for Hamas certain environment. So imagine for a moment in an environment that's a pockmarked by objects, by their vehicles, by pedestrians, etc. If you were to create the voronoi diagrams through that environment, you would have a set of each unique, uh, set of pads or hama is continuously deformable paths that will take you from one, one location to another through it. If you then turn that into its dual, which is the dullest, a triangulation of set environment, presuming that you've got conduct's obstacles, you can then tie all those together rather trivially to create a set of, uh, [inaudible] and, uh, transitions across, switch those paths. A canon can stake out sort of a giVen set of options for the human. It turns out humans tend to. This tends to be a more intuitive way of imposing certain constraints on human operation rather than enforcing that the ego vehicle stick to some arbitrary position within some distance of a safe path.

Speaker 2:          04:42          A, you instead look to enforce only that, the, that the state of the vehicle remain within a constraint bounded end dimensional tube in state space. Those constraints being spatial. Imagine for a moment edges of the roadway or circumventing various objects in the roadway. I'm a imagine them also being dynamic, right? So limits of tire, a tire friction imposed limits on side slip angles. And so using that, what we did is found a way to create those hammad topis forward simulate, uh, the trajectory of the vehicle, a given its current state and some optimal set of controls. Seek inputs that would optimize its stability through that we use model predictive control, uh, in that work and then taking that forward, simulated trajectory computing some metric of threat. For instance, if the objective function for that, uh, minimize the or maximize stability or minimize some, some of these parameters like we'll side slip, then we'll side slip is a fairly good indication of how threatening that optimal maneuver is becoming.

Speaker 2:          05:52          And so what we did is then use that in a modulation of control between the human, the car, such that should the car ever find yourself in a state where that forward simulated optimal trajectory is very near the limits of what the vehicle and it can actually handle. We will have transitioned control fully to the, to the vehicle, to the automated system so that it can avoid an accident. And then it transitions back in some manner and we played with a number of different, uh, methods of transitioning this control to ensure that, um, uh, that we didn't throw off the human mental model which was, which was one of the key concerns. We also wanted to make sure that we were able to arrest a accidents before they happen. What you see here is a simulation that was fairly faithful to the behavior we saw in test drivers up at dearborn in dearborn, Michigan ford provided was provided us with a jaguar site to test this on and what we did.

Speaker 2:          06:50          So what you see here is there's a blue vehicle and a gray vehicle, both in both cases. We have a poorly tuned driver model. In this case it pure pursuit controller with a fairly short look ahead, a shorter than would be appropriate given this scenario in these dynamics. Uh, the gray vehicle is without the intelligent copilot in the loop. Um, you'll notice that obviously the driver becomes unstable, loses control, and leaves the safe roadway. The copilot, remember, is in, is interested not in following any given path. It doesn't care where the vehicle lands on this roadway provided it remains on inside the road. Uh, in the blue vehicles case. Uh, it's the exact same human driver model. Now at the copilot and the loop, you'll notice that as a, as this scenario a continues. What you see here on the left is the green is in this green bar, is the portion of available control authority is being taken by the automated system.

Speaker 2:          07:49          You don't understand, I've never exceeds half of the available control, which is to say that the steering inputs received by the vehicle, uh, and end up being a blend of what the human and what the automation are providing, um, and what, what results is a path for the blue vehicle that actually better tracks the humans intended trajectory. Then even the copilot understood, right? Again, the copilot is keeping the vehicle stable as keeping it on the road. The human is hewing to the center line of that roadway. So there was some very interesting things that came out of this. There were a lot of, uh, we did a lot of work in understanding what kind of feedback was most natural to provide a human. Our biggest concern was if you throw off a human's mental model by causing the vehicles behaviors to deviate from what they expect it to do in response to various control inputs, that can be a problem.

Speaker 2:          08:43          So we tried various things from, you know, adjusting, for instance, one of the, one of the key questions that we had early on was a, if we couple the computer control and the human control via planetary gear and allow the human to feel a actually a backwards torque to what the vehicle is doing. So the car starts to turn right, human will feel the wheel turn left, they'll see it started to turn left. Is that more confusing or less confusing to human. And it turns out it depends on how experienced the human is. Some, some drivers will modulate their input space on tHe torque feedback that they feel through the wheel. For instance, a very experienced driver expects to fuel the we'll pull left when they're turning right. However, less experienced drivers in response to seeing the wheel turning opposite to what the, what the car is supposed to be doing this for a rather confusing experience.

Speaker 2:          09:35          So there were a lot of really interesting a human interface challenges that we were dealing with here. Um, we ended up working through a lot of that, developing a number of, uh, uh, sort of micro applications for it. One of those, uh, at the time gill pratt was leading a darpa program focused on what they call the time maximum ability and manipulation. Uh, we decided to see what the system could do in application to unmanned ground vehicles. So in this case, what you see is a, a human driver sitting at a remote console as, as one would want operating and unmanned vehicle, for instance, in the military. Um, what you see on the left top left is the top down view of what the vehicle sees. I should've played this in repeat mode with bounding boxes, bounding various cones. And what we did is he set up about 20 drivers, 20, 20 a test subjects, uh, looking at this, this, uh, control screen and operating the vehicle through this track.

Speaker 2:          10:44          And we set this up as a race with a prizes for the winners as, as one would expect. And I'm penalize them for every barely hits. If they knocked over the barrel, I think they got a five second penalty. If they brushed a barely got one second penalty and they were to cross, they worked across the field as fast as possible and they couldn't. They had no line of sight connection the vehicle. And we played with some things on, on their interface. We did, uh, you know, we, we caused it to drop out occasionally we, we delayed it as, as one realistically expect in the field. And then we either engaged or didn't engage the copilot to try to understand what effect that had on their performance and their experience. And what we found was not surprisingly, the incidence of collisions declined, declined by about 72 percent when the copilot was engaged versus when it was not a.

Speaker 2:          11:32          We also found that, you know, even with that 72 percent decline in collisions, uh, the speed increased by, I'm blanking on the amount, but it was 20 or 30 percent ish. Finally, and perhaps most interesting to me after every run. Uh, I would ask the driver in the, again, these were blind tests. They didn't know if the copilot was accurate or not, and I would ask them how much control did you feel like you've had over the vehicle? And I found that there was a statistically significant increase of about 12 percent when the copilot was engaged in, in that is to say drivers reported feeling more control the vehicle, 12 percent more of the time when the copilot was engaged and when it wasn't. And then I, the statistics, it turns out they actually at the average level of control that the, that the copilot was taking was 43 percent.

Speaker 2:          12:20          So they were reporting that they felt more in control when in fact there were 43 percent less in control. um, which was, which was interesting. And, uh, I think a bears a little bit on sort of the human psyche in terms of, uh, you know, they were reporting the vehicle was doing what I wanted to do, maybe not what I told it to do, uh, which was, which was kind of fun. Uh, observation and then fund a, uh, I think, I think the most enjoyable part of this was, uh, getting together with the, with the whole group at the end of the study and, and presenting some of this and seeing some of the reactions. So from there, um, you know, we, we, we looked at a few other areas, uh, my, uh, carl unm and I looked at a few different opportunities to commercialize this. Again, this was years ago and the industry was in a very different place than it is today. Uh, we started a company called gimlet than another called ride. Um, this is the logo may look familiar to you. We turn that into a, we had at the time it intended to roll this out across, um, um, you know, various automakers in their operations, uh, at the time, very few saw self driving as a technology. It was really going to impact their business going forward. They were, in fact even even ride sharing at the time was a fairly new concept. Um, that was, I think to a large degree viewed as unproven. Um,

Speaker 2:          13:49          so as I mentioned december of last year,

Speaker 2:          13:56          I cofounded aurora with a couple of folks who have been making significant progress in this space for many years. Chris urmson, who formerly led google's self driving car group at drew back now, is a professor at carnegie mellon university, uh, exceptional machine learning, uh, and an applied machine learning, uh, was one of the founding members of uber self driving car team and lead autonomy and perception there. Um, we felt like we had a unique opportunity at the convergence of a few things. One, the automotive world has really come into the full on realization that self driving and particularly self driving and ride sharing and vehicle electrification, our three vectors that will change the industry. Um, that was something that didn't exist 10 years ago to a significant advances have been made in, um, you know, some of these machine learning techniques in particular deep learning, um, and other neural network

Speaker 3:          14:52          network approaches in the computers that run them. And the availability of low power gpu and tpu options to really do that well in sensing technologies in high resolution radar. And a lot of the light, our development, so it's really a unique time in the self driving world. A lot of these things are really coming together now. Uh, and we felt like by bringing together and experienced team, we had an interesting opportunity to build from a clean sheet, a new, uh, platform, a new self driving a architecture that leverages the latest events as applied machine learning together with our, um, uh, together with our experience of, of where some of the pitfalls tend to be down the road as you develop these systems because you don't tend to see them early on. they tend to express themselves as you get into the long tail of corner cases that she ended up needing to resolve.

Speaker 3:          15:47          So we've built that team. Uh, we have offices in palo alto, California and pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. Uh, we've got fleets of vehicles operating in both politics in Pennsylvania. A couple of weeks ago, uh, we announced that a volkswagen group, uh, one of the largest auto makers in the world, hyundai motor company, also on the largest automakers in the world, have both partnered with aurora. Um, we will be developing. And are developing with them a set of platforms and ultimately we'll, we'll scale that, uh, our technology. I'm on their vehicles across the world. and, and one of the important, the important elements of building. I asked lex before coming out here, what's this group would be most interested in hearing? One of the things that he mentioned was what does it take to build a self driving, you know, build a new company in a space like this.

Speaker 3:          16:34          One of the things that we found very important was a business model that was nonthreatening to others. Uh, we recognize that our strengths and our experience over the last say in my case at decade in chris's case, almost hear a really lies in the development of the self driving systems. Uh, not in building vehicles that I have had some experience there. But, but in developing the self driving. And so our feeling was if our mission is to get a signal to market as quickly as broadly and as safely as possible. And that mission is best served by playing our position and working well with others who can play. There's. Which is why you see the model that we've adopted and is now a, you'll start to see some of the fruits of that through these partnerships with some of these automakers. So at the end of the day are our aspiration and our hope is that this technology that, that is so important, the world in increasing safety and improving access to transportation and improving efficiency in the utilization of our roadways and our cities.

Speaker 3:          17:36          I mean, I, I, this is maybe the first doc I've ever given where I didn't start by rattling off statistics about safety and all the other things. If you haven't heard them yet, you should look them up. They're there stark, right? The fact that most vehicles in the United States today have an average on average three parking spaces as spaces allocated to them. The amount of land that's taken up across the world in housing vehicles that are used less than five percent of the time. Uh, the number of people, I think the United States, the estimate to spend somewhere between six and 15 million people don't have access to the transportation they need either the because they're elderly or disabled or one of many other factors, and so this technology is potentially one of the most impactful for our society in the coming years. It's a tremendously exciting technological challenge and the confluence of those two things I think is a really unique opportunity for engineers and others who are not engineers who really want to get involved to play a role in changing our, changing our world going forward. So with that, maybe I'll. Maybe I'll stop with this and we can go to go to questions.

Speaker 4:          18:52          It's good.

Speaker 2:          18:58          Hello. Thanks for coming on. The question. A lot of a self driving car companies are making extensive use of lidar but you don't see a lot of that with tesla. One of the. No. If you had any thoughts about that. The. I don't want to talk about tesla too much in terms of our specific. Any anything that wasn't public information, I'm not going to get into it. I will say that for aurora, we believe that the right approach is getting to market quickly and you get to market and doing so safely and you get to market quickly and safely.

Speaker 3:          19:27          You leveraged multiple that modalities including lighter. These are, these are all just just to clarify what, what's running in the background. These are all just aurora videos of um,

Speaker 2:          19:38          our car cars driving on various test routes. Luke from the sloan school, a lot of, so a lot of customers have visceral type connections to their automobile. Um, I was wondering how you see that market to the car enthusiast market being affected by avs and then vice versa, how the, uh, how the ads will be designed around those types of customers.

Speaker 3:          19:56          And thanks for asking me. If I am one of those enthusiasts, I very much appreciate being able to drive a car in certain settings. I very much don't appreciate driving it and others. Right? Uh, I remember distinctly several evenings I, I almost literally pounding my steering wheel sitting in quogue and in boston traffic, you know, on my way to somewhere, uh, I do the same in san francisco. I think the opportunity really is to turn that in turn sort of personal vehicle ownership and driving into more of a sport and something you do for leisure. I see it a gentleman sometime I go, uh, asked me to talk. Hey, don't you think this is a problem for the country? I think you meant the world. If people don't learn how to drive, that's just something a human should know how to do. A, my perspective is it's as much of a problem as people not intrinsically knowing how to ride a horse today.

Speaker 3:          21:05          If you want to know how to ride a horse, go ride a horse. If you want to, you want to race a car, go to a race track or go out to a mountain road that's been allocated for it. Um, ultimately I think, I think there is an important place for that because I certainly agree with you. I'm very much a vehicle enthusiast myself. Um, but I think there is so much opportunity here in alleviating some of these other problems, particularly in places where it's not fun to drive that. I think there's a place for both.

Speaker 4:          21:33          Yeah, right. You need to get

Speaker 5:          21:41          congratulations on the partnership was announced recently, I think. Um, so I have a two part question. The first one is, um, so we heard last week from a, I think there was a gentleman from bimo talking about how long they've been working on this autonomous car technology and you seem to have ramped up extremely fast. So, uh, is there a licensing model that you have taken out? I mean, how were you able to commercialize the technology in one year?

Speaker 3:          22:11          Just to be clear, we're not actually commercializing distinguish, we are partnering and developing vehicles and will ultimately be running pilots as we announced a week or two ago with the shuttles we are. However, I will distinguish that from ron commercialization of the technology and I don't want to get too much into, you know, the nuances of that business model. I will say that it is, is one that's done in very close partnership with our automotive partners because at the end of the day they understand their cars, they understand their customers, they have distribution networks. Um, they are, our automotive partners are fairly well positioned, uh, it provided they have the right support in developing the self driving technology, the fairly, fairly well positioned to, uh, you know, roll it out at the scale.

Speaker 5:          23:05          So the second month, my question is again, looking at the you pace of adoption and the maturity of technology, do you see like an opensource model for autonomous cars as they become more and more

Speaker 3:          23:19          unclear? I, I'm not convinced that an open source model is what gets to market most quickly. Um, in the long run, I, I, it's, it's not clear to me, uh, what will happen. I think there will be a handful of successful self driving stacks that will make it a nowhere near the number of self driving companies today. Um, but a handful, I think

Speaker 6:          23:50          two questions. One is in invariably new product development, there's typically two types of bottlenecks. There's a technological bottleneck and an economic bottleneck, right? So technological bottleneck might be, hey, you know, the sensors aren't good enough, or the machine learning algorithms aren't good enough and so on. I'd be interested to hear and it'll shift obviously over time, so I'd be interested to know what you would say is the current thing that if hey, if, if this part of the, of the architecture was 10 times better, we would. And then on the economic side, I'd be interested to know, you know, jeff, if sensors were 100 times cheaper than, so it'd be interesting to hear your perspective.

Speaker 3:          24:28          That's a great question. Let me start with the economic side of it. And just to get that at the wake is a little bit quicker. Answer. The economics of operating a self driving vehicle in a shared network today would close that, that business case closes even with high costs. So sensors, um, that is not, that is not what's stopping us. And that's part of why the gentleman earlier who asked, you know, should use lidar or not. If your target is to initially deploy these in fleets, you would be wise to start at the top end of the market, develop and deploy a system that's as capable as possible, as quickly as possible, and then costs it down over time. And you can do that as computer vision with precision recall increase today. They're not good enough, right? And so, so economically, depending on your model of going to market, and we believe that the right model is through a, you know, on the mobility services,

Speaker 3:          25:33          you can cost out your costs down the center. Inevitably, you know, there's no unobtainium in lidar units today. There's no reason fundamentally that he should cost of lidar unit will lead you to a $70,000 price point, right? Um, however, if you build anything in low enough volumes is going to be expensive. Many of these things will work their way into the standard automotive process. They'll work their way into tier one suppliers and when they do, the automotive community has shown themselves to be exceptional driving those costs down. And so I expect them to come way down to your other question, a technological bottlenecks and challenges.

Speaker 3:          26:09          One of the key challenges of self driving is and remains that of forecasting the intent and behave and future behaviors of other actors both in response to one another, but also in response to your own decisions in motion. That's a perception problem, but it's something more than a perception problem. It's also a prediction and you know, there, there are a number of different things that come together to have that have to come together to solve this. We're excited about some of the that we're using and interleaving various, a modern machine learning techniques throughout the system to do things like project our own behaviors that were learned for the ego vehicle on others and assume that they'll behave as we would had we been in that situation. Like an expert system kind of approach, right? Yeah. Yeah. Uh, you, you assume nominal behavior and you guard against all phenomenal, right? Um, but it's, it's very much a, it's not a solved problem. I wouldn't say it's very much as you get into that really long tail development when you're no longer putting out demonstration videos, but you're, instead of just putting your head down and seeking out those fine online's yeah. That's the kind of problem you tend to deal with. Yeah.

Speaker 7:          27:31          Um, so this question isn't necessarily about the development of a self driving cars, but more of like an ethics question. Um, when you're putting a human lives into the hands of software, isn't there always the possibility for like outside agents with malicious intent to use it for their own gain and how do you guys, if you do have a plan, how do you intend to protect against that?

Speaker 3:          27:57          So security is a very real aspect of this that has to be solved. It's a constant game of cat and mouse and so I think it just requires a very good team and a concerted effort over time. Um, I, I don't think, I don't think you solve it once and I certainly wouldn't pretend to have a plan that solves it and has done with it. Um, we're, we're, we, we try to leverage best practices where we can in the fundamental architecture of the system to make it less exposed and in particular, key parts of the system was exposed to nefarious actions of others. But at the end of the day, it's just a constant, um, it's a constant development effort.

Speaker 8:          28:46          Thanks for being here. Um, so I had a question about what opportunities self driving cars open up since driving has been designed around a human being at the center since the beginning. If you put a computer at the center, what, you know, a society wide differences and maybe even within individual car differences that open up like cars go 150 miles an hour on the highway and get places much faster with cars, be like, look differently when a human doesn't need to be paying attention and stuff like that.

Speaker 3:          29:15          I think the answer is yes. The, and, and that's, that's something that's very exciting, right? So one of the, I think one of the unique opportunities that automakers in particular have when self driving technology gets incorporated into the vehicles is they can do things like play with, like differentiate the user experience. They can provide services, um, you know, uh, augmented reality services or you know, a location resilient and many other sort of. It opens a new window into an entirely new market that automakers haven't historically played in. Um, and it allows them to change the, the, the vehicles themselves, as you've mentioned, the interior. Can change as we validate some of these self driving systems and confirm that they do in fact reduce the collision, the rate of collisions as we hope they will. Um, you can start to pull out a lot of the, um, extra, you know, mass and other things that we've added to vehicles to make them more passively safe. Right? Roll cages, crumple zones, airbags, you know, a lot of these things. Um, you know, presumably in a world where we don't crash, there is, there is much less need for passive safety system. So yes.

Speaker 5:          30:36          I have a question about the gullah nogo. A desk that you conduct for certain features. Like you mentioned, the throttle control, where your slow down the throttle. Assuming that the driver has pressed the wrong wrong pedal. When you test, when you decided to launch that feature, how do you know it's definitely going to work in all scenarios because your data set might not be censored.

Speaker 3:          30:55          It's a, it's a statistical evaluation every case, right? You're right there, you will. This is, this is part of the art of self driving vehicle development is you will never have comprehensively captured every case, every scenario that is as uh, my, my, my, uh, some of you may want to correct me on this. I think that's an unbounded set in fact, have factory banner at some point, but I think it's on. Um, and so you'll, you'll never actually have characterized everything. What you will have done, hopefully if you do it right, is you will have established with a reasonable degree of confidence that you can perform at a level of safety that's better than the average human driver. And once you've reached that threshold and you're confident that you have reached that threshold, I think the, the opportunity to launch is, is real, and you should seriously consider it.

Speaker 5:          31:49          So thank you for your talk today. First a, and my question is self driving seems to be able to ultimately take over their world to some extent, but just like other technologists today that open up new opportunities but also bring in adverse effects. Um, so how do you respond to fear and negative effects that may come in one day and specifically what do you see as the positive and negative implications of future day self driving

Speaker 3:          32:19          positive and negative implications? So the positive ones, I kind of listen and go find your favorite press article on note list them as well. The negative ones in the near term. Uh, I do. I do worry a little bit about the displacement of jobs, not a little bit this will happen. It happens with every technology like this. I think it's incumbent on us to find a good way of transitioning those who are employed in some of the transportation sectors that will be affected into a better work. Right. Um, there are a few opportunities that are interesting in that regard, but I think it's an important thing to start discussing now because it's going to take, you know, a few years and you know, by the time we got these self driving systems on the roads really starting to place that labor, I'd really like to have a new home for it.

Speaker 5:          33:19          Hi. Uh, I'm kasha from the sloan school. Uh, my question was more about your business model, again, with partnering with both vw and he and day and you just perspective on how you were able to effectively do that. Did not one of them want to go sort of exclusive with you. And what was your sort of thought process about that?

Speaker 3:          33:40          So, our, our mission, as I mentioned, is to get the technology to market broadly and quickly and safely. Uh, we are, you know, haven't been and remain convinced that the right way to do that is by providing it to, as much of the industry as possible to every automaker who shares our vision and our approach. Um, we were pleased to see that both volkswagen group, uh, and I'm assuming you all know the scope of volkswagen, right? This is a massive automaker hyundai motor, also very large cross honda, ikea and genesis. They both shared our vision of how we should do this, which was important to us. Um, they both shared, you know, a, a keen interest in making a difference at scale through their platforms. A volkswagen has a very admirable set of initiatives around electric vehicle electrification. And few other things, honda is doing similar things. Um, and so for us it was important that we enable everyone and that was kind of what aurora was started to do.

Speaker 5:          34:49          Hi, I had a question now that I see a lot of companies are coming up with self driving cars, right? So most of the costs are pretty much all the technology is bound only to the car. So would we see something like an open network where car communicate with each other regardless of which company they come from and what this in any way, uh, you know, increase the safety or the performance of vehicles and stuff like that.

Speaker 3:          35:12          I think. I think you're getting a vehicle to vehicle vehicle to infrastructure communication efforts ongoing and that, uh, and it's certainly, it's, it's only positive, right? The, it having that information available to you can only make things better. The challenge who's historically bandwidth vehicle to vehicle and break your particular vehicle to infrastructure or vice versa, um, that it doesn't scale well, one and two, it's been slow. It's been much slower and coming in our development. And so when we develop these systems, we develop them without the expectation that those, that those communication protocol are available to us, we'll certainly protect for them and it will certainly be, you know, a benefit once they're, once they're here, but until then, many of the hard problems that I would have welcomed 10 years ago to have a beacon on every traffic light that just told me it's state rather than having to perceive it. Uh, I would have certainly use those 10 years ago. Now they're less significant because we've kind of worked our way through a lot of the problems they would have solved.

Speaker 9:          36:14          Sinky food talk. My question is, what's your opinion about cooperation of self driving vr curse? So maybe I think if you can control a group of self driving because at the same time you can achieve a lot of benefits to the traffic.

Speaker 3:          36:31          Yes. That is where one of the, that is where a lot of the benefits come from and infrastructure utilization, right, is in ride sharing with autonomous vehicles. And specifically, you know, the better we understand demand patterns, people movement goods movement, the better we can sort of optimally allocate these vehicles at locations where they're needed. So yes, that's certainly that, that coordination, this is where, as I mentioned, these three vectors of vehicle electrification, ride sharing and autonomy or, or transparent, you know, mobility as a service and autonomy really come together with a unique value proposition. Yeah. Okay. Thank you. Yeah.

Speaker 9:          37:13          Thank you so much for a great talk. Thank you.
