1
00:00:11,090 --> 00:00:15,230
Thanks for coming. This is going
to be about video games and uh,

2
00:00:15,300 --> 00:00:18,920
axillary content associated with the
video game industry stuff that spins out,

3
00:00:18,950 --> 00:00:21,470
you know, everybody has an
intellectual property product, right?

4
00:00:21,560 --> 00:00:26,560
Video game and no one expects the Spanish
inquisition or that was the reference

5
00:00:26,601 --> 00:00:29,420
to it in 1980s phones. Anybody
get that? Cause you know,

6
00:00:29,570 --> 00:00:32,240
I'm riffing off of 1980s video
game culture a little bit.

7
00:00:32,241 --> 00:00:34,760
That's why I have the ready player
one thing going on. So I don't,

8
00:00:34,761 --> 00:00:36,260
that's not a spoiler alert.
Spoiler alert.

9
00:00:36,290 --> 00:00:40,280
I don't want to ruin ready player one of
the great movie and the book. Any hope?

10
00:00:40,310 --> 00:00:44,270
So yes. Uh, people have, uh,
intellectual properties, right?

11
00:00:44,271 --> 00:00:48,260
They make them a video game and no one
expects all kinds of derivative works.

12
00:00:48,261 --> 00:00:50,000
What kinds of things are
going to spin out of them?

13
00:00:50,390 --> 00:00:53,870
Definition of what a derivative work is
is pretty fixed when it comes to things

14
00:00:53,871 --> 00:00:56,960
like Harry Potter, right? If I
write fan fiction on Harry Potter,

15
00:00:57,350 --> 00:00:59,810
that's a derivative work.
I'm using all the characters,

16
00:00:59,870 --> 00:01:04,820
maybe spinning off the storyline, but if
I do a derivative work of a video game,

17
00:01:05,300 --> 00:01:06,133
what does that mean?

18
00:01:06,250 --> 00:01:11,250
Is it if I record myself playing a video
game right and may commentary and do

19
00:01:11,271 --> 00:01:16,271
crazy tricks or whatever is that it's a
bit of work or is that transformative?

20
00:01:16,671 --> 00:01:21,650
Which is it? Right. So a lot of
this has to do with that question.

21
00:01:21,651 --> 00:01:24,950
A lot of the research that I've done has
to do with that question of transition

22
00:01:24,951 --> 00:01:29,951
between well had had is something like
a platform like youtube afford that kind

23
00:01:31,551 --> 00:01:34,000
of playing. By what I mean
by afford, I mean, uh,

24
00:01:34,050 --> 00:01:37,930
that's from like HCI langue
language. You guys get it right. Uh,

25
00:01:37,970 --> 00:01:41,450
that means well are the,
is going to let this happen or not?

26
00:01:41,480 --> 00:01:43,880
They preventative and that
positive affordances or not.

27
00:01:44,390 --> 00:01:46,010
And it's also a play on words.

28
00:01:46,310 --> 00:01:49,940
Can you afford the intellectual property
liability that you might want if you

29
00:01:49,941 --> 00:01:54,941
want to make your platform particularly
playful to let your users make your out

30
00:01:55,020 --> 00:01:59,240
with intellectual property products
that maybe are not on, you know,

31
00:01:59,660 --> 00:02:00,650
could be transformative,

32
00:02:00,651 --> 00:02:05,360
could not be transformative but
mashup culture or you know, practices.

33
00:02:06,020 --> 00:02:10,000
People scroll down a little bit with
the intellectual property product, uh,

34
00:02:10,120 --> 00:02:13,850
me give you something entirely new,
entirely transformative.

35
00:02:13,940 --> 00:02:15,830
And as a platform owner,

36
00:02:15,860 --> 00:02:20,860
you capitalize that as a participant in
that you get to share in the profits,

37
00:02:21,321 --> 00:02:25,880
hopefully. So how do you design
platforms that strike that balance?

38
00:02:25,910 --> 00:02:29,450
That's the underlying
question, right? I don't know.

39
00:02:29,900 --> 00:02:34,670
I started doing this work in 2009.
I lived a blessed existence.

40
00:02:34,671 --> 00:02:38,780
I get to play video games and, and call
that and just have so much fun. Right?

41
00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:42,680
And that's my research and
I get to play video games.

42
00:02:42,680 --> 00:02:44,270
I get to hang out with video gamers.

43
00:02:44,271 --> 00:02:49,271
I get to hang out with communities that
love playing games and ask them how it

44
00:02:50,211 --> 00:02:55,211
is they take something that they love so
much and transition it into a business,

45
00:02:55,580 --> 00:02:57,230
a business product,
or

46
00:02:59,290 --> 00:03:02,050
sent it out there to the world.
What compels them to do that?

47
00:03:02,170 --> 00:03:05,830
Culture is important, right? If
you're going to design something,

48
00:03:05,890 --> 00:03:07,990
I would say you need a
cultural anthropologist,

49
00:03:07,991 --> 00:03:10,870
especially if you have it really
committed community for the,

50
00:03:11,020 --> 00:03:14,470
for the product that you hope to host,
let's say on your platform, right?

51
00:03:14,950 --> 00:03:17,440
You need to find out what,
what matters to them the most.

52
00:03:17,530 --> 00:03:19,810
So that's what motivates me.
Uh,

53
00:03:19,930 --> 00:03:22,400
the intellectual property question is
important to me. I mean, I've written,

54
00:03:22,420 --> 00:03:26,580
I've written a book on it. I've been
called the copyright and our, uh, yes,

55
00:03:26,590 --> 00:03:28,390
because I have a really limited,

56
00:03:29,730 --> 00:03:32,770
I'm not a big fan of
the US copyright system,

57
00:03:32,771 --> 00:03:34,810
so if you want to read my book,

58
00:03:34,811 --> 00:03:39,400
you can get it for free from the MIT
press because I magically negotiated a

59
00:03:39,401 --> 00:03:42,130
creative Commons license for it
and people start trying, if you,

60
00:03:42,131 --> 00:03:47,050
about how I manage that.
So it's available, you can
download it for free. Okay.

61
00:03:47,320 --> 00:03:52,210
So here's what I got.
Is this look familiar to anybody,

62
00:03:53,350 --> 00:03:56,770
right? This is twitch
plays Pokemon. Uh, and

63
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:00,110
twitch isn't a particular,

64
00:04:00,440 --> 00:04:03,830
back when I started this
project in [inaudible] in 2009,

65
00:04:04,330 --> 00:04:08,780
video game commentary was
still in its infancy. Yeah.

66
00:04:09,440 --> 00:04:11,360
Uh,
maybe the fo the

67
00:04:12,900 --> 00:04:17,690
directors that the party that
I guess directors who were, um,

68
00:04:18,810 --> 00:04:22,880
starting out the channels have you had a
hundred a hundred subscribers a hundred

69
00:04:22,881 --> 00:04:25,500
times this. All right. Um,

70
00:04:26,190 --> 00:04:27,990
but I thought it's going
to become something I,

71
00:04:28,010 --> 00:04:31,410
and I wondered why Youtube has really
done a great job in making it possible for

72
00:04:31,411 --> 00:04:33,780
a platform to be just super plastic.
In other words,

73
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:38,880
have the ability to accommodate all kinds
of different content in a modular way

74
00:04:39,060 --> 00:04:43,430
so that users can adaptively
put their content opt in,

75
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:47,940
whatever way that they can identify with.
Then I,

76
00:04:48,230 --> 00:04:52,320
then after some time of doing that,
Justin TV,

77
00:04:52,321 --> 00:04:56,210
I remember Justin TV, the first version
of twitch. All right. So then twitch, um,

78
00:04:56,850 --> 00:05:00,780
was even more plastic I think. But that's
not to say that youtube isn't great,

79
00:05:00,781 --> 00:05:02,780
it's just that, okay, this
is a different set of, uh,

80
00:05:02,830 --> 00:05:05,610
and the reason why is it
their intellectual property
or their terms of service

81
00:05:05,970 --> 00:05:09,120
requirements for a little less stringent.
So in this case,

82
00:05:09,210 --> 00:05:10,980
twitch plays Pokemon
in case you don't know,

83
00:05:11,450 --> 00:05:16,410
and I get to play a little bit
of a video, um, is someone,

84
00:05:17,820 --> 00:05:22,820
obviously the channel owner hacked away
at the interface so that check a man's

85
00:05:23,310 --> 00:05:25,740
would end up being play commands,
right?

86
00:05:25,741 --> 00:05:30,300
So anybody who was watching the livestream
cause instant chat, check a man's man,

87
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:34,290
and you ended up playing Pokemon even
though you technically should be the

88
00:05:34,291 --> 00:05:37,720
audience watching the live stream. Right?
But not, you're a good player. So are,

89
00:05:37,890 --> 00:05:40,560
are you ready to be a player
as an audience? That's great.

90
00:05:40,620 --> 00:05:45,620
I was sitting on a at Virginia Tech and
a panel with the associate registrar of

91
00:05:45,661 --> 00:05:47,520
Copyrights, right? The, the,

92
00:05:47,560 --> 00:05:51,000
the second in command copyright
officer in United States.

93
00:05:51,570 --> 00:05:55,760
And I raised this question is who do
we blame? Uh, who, who's liable for it?

94
00:05:55,770 --> 00:05:57,870
The NCA claim digital copyright.

95
00:05:57,871 --> 00:06:01,490
It's funny because obviously there was
some circumvention right? Some patent,

96
00:06:01,491 --> 00:06:05,390
log out, whacked up a little bit, and
we could not come to that conclusion.

97
00:06:05,960 --> 00:06:10,510
And not that, not that
twitch cared, not right.

98
00:06:10,640 --> 00:06:14,180
Maybe Nintendo cared. Nintendo tends
to care more than other companies,

99
00:06:14,690 --> 00:06:15,830
but not the twitch cared.

100
00:06:16,370 --> 00:06:20,210
And who would you hold Bible and he
was so the plasticity of the platform,

101
00:06:20,211 --> 00:06:23,790
and I want you to guys if you can
remember that word plasticity, uh,

102
00:06:23,930 --> 00:06:28,070
allowed for modular putting together
like what you would consider disparate

103
00:06:28,071 --> 00:06:31,960
platforms of video game platform
and interface on [inaudible].

104
00:06:32,650 --> 00:06:33,800
I want a webpage,

105
00:06:33,920 --> 00:06:37,780
a platform and a chat commands it a lot
of this modularity to come together to

106
00:06:37,790 --> 00:06:42,540
this novel product and it
kept going. Right. All right,

107
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:43,970
so as a designer I would think,

108
00:06:44,330 --> 00:06:47,000
I mean I used to teach for product
and design innovation at Rensselaer

109
00:06:47,001 --> 00:06:51,820
polytechnic and modularity,
the ability to have a,

110
00:06:51,920 --> 00:06:55,310
have enough structure
to have fixed elements,

111
00:06:55,700 --> 00:06:59,300
but enough plasticity
to have the user design.

112
00:06:59,330 --> 00:07:04,100
It's his or her ultimate imagined
use. That's magic. Right?

113
00:07:04,101 --> 00:07:06,830
That's great. And that's, I didn't
have to know that the system,

114
00:07:07,330 --> 00:07:12,080
the screen infinity anyway, so that's
how I started thinking about platforms.

115
00:07:12,081 --> 00:07:12,610
Generally.

116
00:07:12,610 --> 00:07:16,220
How do you design them in video game
culture was particularly well suited to

117
00:07:16,221 --> 00:07:18,470
study it because they're always playing.

118
00:07:19,340 --> 00:07:23,810
They're always hacking away either at
the game rules, right? How to cheat,

119
00:07:23,830 --> 00:07:28,820
how to work arounds, uh, or
also how to show their content.

120
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:34,490
So let me just, I'm going to place in
the background. Do not be distracted.

121
00:07:34,930 --> 00:07:37,490
All right? If you want, it
can be a script. I don't
know. There's no sound. Okay.

122
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:41,690
You're going to be distracted on,
I'll talk to you. Anyway. So in 2009,

123
00:07:41,691 --> 00:07:43,850
I started following the
call of duty community

124
00:07:46,820 --> 00:07:49,930
called Duke community.
It started with my wife for two.

125
00:07:49,940 --> 00:07:54,110
I needed to play better because
I suck. And um, I thought, well,

126
00:07:54,111 --> 00:07:55,760
maybe youtube has it,
how to write.

127
00:07:55,761 --> 00:07:59,930
And it turns out it was entertaining
beyond its use of value. In other words,

128
00:07:59,960 --> 00:08:02,810
I could learn some things from the
people that was watching. By the way,

129
00:08:02,811 --> 00:08:06,530
this is me. Um, I can learn things
from the people I was watching,

130
00:08:06,531 --> 00:08:09,530
but I also found an
incredibly entertaining,

131
00:08:09,531 --> 00:08:12,780
it was entertaining for so many reasons
that the commentary that the way they

132
00:08:12,781 --> 00:08:15,630
were talking about the
game play was great. Uh,

133
00:08:15,640 --> 00:08:19,160
the tips and tricks were great and
maybe they weren't terrible. Yes,

134
00:08:19,161 --> 00:08:20,330
I know it's modern warfare.

135
00:08:20,360 --> 00:08:24,260
I know this is the black ops and I know
there's a lot of problems with game

136
00:08:24,380 --> 00:08:28,870
culture generally, so I'm focusing
on the, on the positive. So, um,

137
00:08:28,880 --> 00:08:33,140
so there was a lot of learning
to be done anyway. Uh,

138
00:08:33,380 --> 00:08:37,120
this guy isn't bad, Huh? It's not
bad for a college professor. Um,

139
00:08:38,060 --> 00:08:39,470
so anyway,

140
00:08:40,190 --> 00:08:44,600
what I learned was that gamers have
put together a whole bunch of different

141
00:08:44,601 --> 00:08:48,440
types of technologies to make
themselves better. That's great.

142
00:08:49,280 --> 00:08:54,280
But also that they had created
entertainment of doing it
by doing it because the

143
00:08:54,900 --> 00:08:59,340
platform had afforded it and the platform
that [inaudible] three things that are

144
00:08:59,341 --> 00:09:04,080
really important, right? It gave them a
sense of ownership. So in other words,

145
00:09:04,740 --> 00:09:09,740
what people could do by modifying
the game from a play experience to a

146
00:09:10,220 --> 00:09:13,830
viewership product.
Give them a sense of ownership.

147
00:09:15,210 --> 00:09:19,560
That's what Henry Jenkins not at USC
is called a moral economy, right?

148
00:09:19,830 --> 00:09:23,940
So if your platform can afford a little
bit of moral of the economy from your

149
00:09:23,941 --> 00:09:27,480
audience, that's a win because
now they're invested, right?

150
00:09:27,510 --> 00:09:30,420
That requires people to
give away, give, give up.

151
00:09:30,421 --> 00:09:33,720
The idea that any media product is,
is a done product.

152
00:09:33,721 --> 00:09:38,040
Who here has written anything or design
something and you sort of set it out in

153
00:09:38,041 --> 00:09:42,030
the world, right? And then you think, gee,

154
00:09:42,300 --> 00:09:45,450
that's it. I will struggle.
Then I sweat. And that was,

155
00:09:45,750 --> 00:09:50,310
but then what would you do if someone
comes along and Margit modifies it in some

156
00:09:50,311 --> 00:09:52,800
way changes,
it creates friction out of it.

157
00:09:52,950 --> 00:09:57,390
The idea is that the platform
should have an element of, um,

158
00:09:57,810 --> 00:10:01,800
welcoming things that are modifications
of media, existing media products,

159
00:10:01,801 --> 00:10:05,280
which would be a derivative work.
Right? But that gives people ownership.

160
00:10:05,730 --> 00:10:07,890
That's great.
The other thing is belonging.

161
00:10:07,950 --> 00:10:12,630
The sense of belonging is anybody
here know the term? Brony. Okay.

162
00:10:12,950 --> 00:10:15,420
Could you, okay. Should
I clarify that for folks?

163
00:10:15,980 --> 00:10:20,850
A brony is typically a young man between
the ages of 18 or even younger and

164
00:10:20,851 --> 00:10:24,510
however, who has an affinity?
A fanish affinity fans.

165
00:10:24,511 --> 00:10:25,950
They're fans of my little pony.

166
00:10:26,370 --> 00:10:31,020
My little pony is a TV series from
the 1980s features are little pony.

167
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:34,170
They're kind of cute. Any who, um,

168
00:10:34,530 --> 00:10:39,360
this fan group would have been an isolated
fan group if it hadn't been for the

169
00:10:39,361 --> 00:10:43,380
web. Right? Once they get on the
web and started talking about it,

170
00:10:43,381 --> 00:10:47,100
they created an emergent culture.
Now you can go to a comic con, right?

171
00:10:47,160 --> 00:10:48,300
Does anybody here at bent to comicon?

172
00:10:48,380 --> 00:10:50,920
I'm sure many people have been to
comic con. If you go to Comicon,

173
00:10:50,940 --> 00:10:54,420
you'll see people playing,
doing cosplay on a my little pony.

174
00:10:54,750 --> 00:10:58,770
The point of this is that the platform of,
let's say the Internet,

175
00:10:58,771 --> 00:11:00,120
if we're going to talk in a big terms,

176
00:11:00,390 --> 00:11:04,380
created a space for culture to
exist to happen to exist outside of,

177
00:11:04,381 --> 00:11:08,250
let's say your own small group of
people or even just yourself, right?

178
00:11:08,251 --> 00:11:13,180
Culturally requires more than one video.
Game. Culture is the same way, right? It,

179
00:11:13,560 --> 00:11:18,090
especially around this particular genre
of video game commentary that if it

180
00:11:18,091 --> 00:11:23,091
wasn't for the fact that a
platform afforded communication
with others about the

181
00:11:23,491 --> 00:11:25,770
game and things that maybe
were experienced in the game,

182
00:11:26,400 --> 00:11:30,120
then that sense of cultural belonging is
something that's bigger than yourself.

183
00:11:30,360 --> 00:11:31,830
It would have been lost.

184
00:11:31,860 --> 00:11:34,440
You would have maybe had friends
to play with maybe land parties,

185
00:11:34,441 --> 00:11:37,620
but otherwise there wouldn't be
anything bigger or that grows.

186
00:11:37,860 --> 00:11:40,140
So that's great for the platform.
And then freedom of movement,

187
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:45,560
freedom of movement means the idea
that the platform isn't locked up,

188
00:11:46,380 --> 00:11:51,330
that the feature set interfaces with other
feature sets that may not necessarily

189
00:11:51,331 --> 00:11:56,290
be owned by your platform. Right. Okay.

190
00:11:56,620 --> 00:12:01,620
So I'm going to quickly bring
myself up to date because you know,

191
00:12:02,380 --> 00:12:06,460
I talk and then my notes,
we'll recycle it refocused me.

192
00:12:06,960 --> 00:12:10,720
All right, so these are the three
sort of the, the magic recipe, right?

193
00:12:10,721 --> 00:12:15,330
The triumvirate. And let's
see, here we go. He covered it.

194
00:12:15,331 --> 00:12:19,720
All of these. And then are we good at
this guy? Uh, the ghost in the shell.

195
00:12:20,740 --> 00:12:24,410
If you're going to have a platform,
right?

196
00:12:24,460 --> 00:12:29,460
That is going to afford a level of
plasticity of a level of user or power.

197
00:12:29,950 --> 00:12:34,150
You're going to have to be prepared
for indeterminacy and surprises, right?

198
00:12:34,570 --> 00:12:35,890
Things are gonna happen in,

199
00:12:35,950 --> 00:12:39,940
in a system that is already
chaotic because there are
so many moving parts that

200
00:12:39,941 --> 00:12:43,000
are going to be wholly unexpected
game designers notice, right?

201
00:12:43,001 --> 00:12:47,900
They call it emergence emergence in AI
but also emergency and player, uh, um,

202
00:12:48,040 --> 00:12:51,700
behavior. But also you can think of
it as emergency and user behavior.

203
00:12:51,701 --> 00:12:56,050
And I think the youtube gaming
community show that particularly well,

204
00:12:56,470 --> 00:12:58,390
right? Things happen on
the youtube game community.

205
00:12:58,391 --> 00:13:02,020
I think we're entirely unexpected.
The twitch thing is the twitch plays.

206
00:13:02,021 --> 00:13:02,890
Pokemon is great,

207
00:13:03,190 --> 00:13:07,810
but also the fact that there is such
a thing as a video game commentary.

208
00:13:07,811 --> 00:13:09,460
And this is before youtube gaming,
by the way.

209
00:13:09,461 --> 00:13:13,270
So all my references are historical.
Yes, Youtube gaming now exists,

210
00:13:13,480 --> 00:13:18,000
but it wouldn't have existed if it
hadn't first existed as youtube video

211
00:13:18,010 --> 00:13:22,810
commentary for years before that.
Right? This starts in 28, 2008,

212
00:13:22,811 --> 00:13:27,790
2009 and youtube came, he didn't
come out until 2015. Right?

213
00:13:27,820 --> 00:13:32,620
So it took a whole year as a response
to this level of user activity, right?

214
00:13:32,890 --> 00:13:36,010
And as a responsible for the competition,
twitch was really ready to,

215
00:13:36,520 --> 00:13:39,010
to dole out on that particular field,
right?

216
00:13:39,880 --> 00:13:44,470
So you gotta be ready for surprises
and video game commentary.

217
00:13:44,471 --> 00:13:46,840
Communities provided the proof of that,

218
00:13:46,841 --> 00:13:49,960
that they were going to do
interesting and new things. And okay,

219
00:13:49,961 --> 00:13:53,680
so you want to have a platform that gives
you some plasticity, some user control,

220
00:13:53,681 --> 00:13:58,570
belonging, a sense of belonging,
moot freedom of movement.

221
00:13:58,920 --> 00:14:01,300
Um, and let me go back to
that one and ownership, right?

222
00:14:01,570 --> 00:14:06,000
But then you have to balance it because,
well, you are a corporation, so,

223
00:14:08,020 --> 00:14:11,390
all right? Uh, it has to be
balanced with some things. Uh,

224
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:16,810
you have to have the freedom
to create, play, right?

225
00:14:16,810 --> 00:14:19,270
To be able to play in the
platform at the same time.

226
00:14:19,271 --> 00:14:22,300
That has to be balanced with three things,
overly grabby copyright regimes.

227
00:14:22,810 --> 00:14:25,150
Obviously that's the death
star with a big C. Right?

228
00:14:25,330 --> 00:14:27,400
And all your creativity are belong to us.

229
00:14:27,401 --> 00:14:31,780
Does anybody know that particular
reference to video game culture? Right?

230
00:14:32,520 --> 00:14:33,550
Uh,
there's a,

231
00:14:33,630 --> 00:14:37,780
there's a great video game
from the 80s that it was,

232
00:14:37,810 --> 00:14:40,890
it was dubbed over with,
with dicey English and it's an,

233
00:14:40,930 --> 00:14:44,890
all your base are belong to us.
It's awesome. So it'd become,

234
00:14:44,920 --> 00:14:46,480
it's become a thing in video.

235
00:14:46,510 --> 00:14:49,810
So now every time we talk about something
ridiculous, like I'm going to get you,

236
00:14:49,811 --> 00:14:52,660
we say all your base are belong us.
So that's why I have it on there.

237
00:14:52,661 --> 00:14:54,470
All your co it creativity or belong to us.

238
00:14:54,471 --> 00:14:58,460
So you don't want to be this deathstar
you don't want to be the platform, right?

239
00:14:58,610 --> 00:15:02,360
That says all your creativity are
belong to us. You do not. Right.

240
00:15:02,690 --> 00:15:07,520
Especially with with w when the culture
is one of sharing and the culture is one

241
00:15:07,521 --> 00:15:12,280
of participation with the culture
is one of performance, right? Um,

242
00:15:12,470 --> 00:15:15,680
that is going to be a hard sell.
Okay.

243
00:15:16,640 --> 00:15:20,170
So there is overly grabby copyright
regimes purposefully designed in

244
00:15:20,171 --> 00:15:23,360
compatibility between platforms. You
don't want to close off your platforms.

245
00:15:23,630 --> 00:15:27,140
The reason that youtube system worked
was because it was pretty open.

246
00:15:27,470 --> 00:15:28,470
Who here can a,

247
00:15:28,520 --> 00:15:33,320
has ever seen the CBS logo show up in
the NBC and an NBC program broadcast

248
00:15:33,500 --> 00:15:38,360
anywhere, anytime ever in
mass media. Never. Never.

249
00:15:38,990 --> 00:15:41,510
Right. Yeah, but you're on youtube.

250
00:15:42,180 --> 00:15:46,670
They have a Twitter logo. You
guys are mixing your copy,
you guys are mixing your,

251
00:15:46,780 --> 00:15:50,030
your trademarks and you don't care
because your platform around the youtube

252
00:15:50,031 --> 00:15:54,290
platform is open to others.
That is a win. If you,

253
00:15:54,291 --> 00:15:55,520
if I were to use economics,

254
00:15:55,521 --> 00:15:58,850
I would say that's a great example
of the Nash Equilibrium, right?

255
00:15:59,090 --> 00:16:03,320
Of maximizing overall wealth by loosening,

256
00:16:03,321 --> 00:16:05,540
by making decisions about choices.
Right?

257
00:16:05,960 --> 00:16:10,670
That that account for at the end,
everybody wins state like a zero sum game.

258
00:16:10,820 --> 00:16:12,980
Right? All right. So

259
00:16:15,760 --> 00:16:20,690
it has to be a certain acceptance
of chaos, right? Um, that

260
00:16:22,940 --> 00:16:24,260
users are,
aren't really,

261
00:16:24,560 --> 00:16:29,000
users are going to do what ads and a
particular brand of use or a particular

262
00:16:29,001 --> 00:16:32,600
type of participatory user is going
to do it much more so than others.

263
00:16:32,780 --> 00:16:36,640
But these might be the users that you
want to foster an afford cause they are

264
00:16:36,641 --> 00:16:38,870
the most creative.
They're going to,

265
00:16:38,930 --> 00:16:43,130
they're inventing things on the fly
and they wish they could do it. Right.

266
00:16:43,760 --> 00:16:47,750
Uh, so let me give you the perspective
from a video gamer. Someone like myself,

267
00:16:47,840 --> 00:16:52,370
right? Yes, I am. I, that's
the other thing. You can't
really talk about a medium,

268
00:16:52,371 --> 00:16:56,660
right? Unless you really, I
don't know, Taco, unless you
submerge yourself in it. Um,

269
00:16:57,320 --> 00:17:01,970
you know, it's really important
to just really be veracious,

270
00:17:02,120 --> 00:17:05,840
right? About a medium that you love
and, you know, talk about. Um, okay.

271
00:17:05,841 --> 00:17:06,674
So here it goes.

272
00:17:07,370 --> 00:17:12,090
This is the view of the
youtube platform from, uh,

273
00:17:12,410 --> 00:17:14,930
a Gamer's perspective circa 2009.

274
00:17:15,290 --> 00:17:18,920
We'll start with what did video gamers
who are going to put stuff online?

275
00:17:19,110 --> 00:17:23,930
Sage was the profit motive of Youtube.
This is it.

276
00:17:24,110 --> 00:17:24,880
This is it.
This,

277
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:28,820
it's basically they didn't care to that
as far as they're concerned is the gnome

278
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:33,400
plan for profit, right? Uh,
they knew, you'd said was,
could a collecting everything.

279
00:17:33,430 --> 00:17:36,980
That's the metaphor. The underpants
just collect anything that's visual.

280
00:17:37,190 --> 00:17:40,130
The profit motive or the profits
system was unknown to them,

281
00:17:40,131 --> 00:17:42,550
or they didn't care at the beginning.
Uh,

282
00:17:42,660 --> 00:17:47,570
and all they really cared about was
playing and sharing their passion.

283
00:17:47,690 --> 00:17:48,523
That was it.

284
00:17:49,410 --> 00:17:52,800
That who here knows about
creative communities is
anybody who participated in a

285
00:17:52,801 --> 00:17:53,730
creative community,

286
00:17:54,150 --> 00:17:59,150
creative communities tend to not care
about the profit motive too much,

287
00:17:59,550 --> 00:18:02,670
especially in the stages when we were
in the stage and when they're putting up

288
00:18:02,671 --> 00:18:06,240
there their rough drafts, right?
It's important for them to share,

289
00:18:06,660 --> 00:18:10,590
but the profit motive is really not
always in their scheme of thinking.

290
00:18:10,980 --> 00:18:12,900
And this is why I have,
this isn't one of my favorite

291
00:18:14,430 --> 00:18:19,430
elements of south park or moments in south
park when they presented the plan for

292
00:18:20,611 --> 00:18:23,760
profit, which is basically the
beginning. This is how they saw it.

293
00:18:23,761 --> 00:18:24,990
But of course that changed right?

294
00:18:25,260 --> 00:18:28,830
When partnerships rolled in and when
you do partnerships rolled in with

295
00:18:28,831 --> 00:18:31,140
machinima partnerships.
So showing up,

296
00:18:31,410 --> 00:18:33,900
then that changed and the
profit motive became very real.

297
00:18:34,230 --> 00:18:36,090
Then their mindset changes.
But this is the beginning.

298
00:18:36,570 --> 00:18:38,640
This is the other thing
that's really important.

299
00:18:38,641 --> 00:18:42,930
Who can recognize this particular
image? Anybody? Yeah, there we go.

300
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:47,720
That is working. I think I've stitched,
watched it again the other day. Uh,

301
00:18:47,730 --> 00:18:51,240
this is one of the first true
representations of video game culture.

302
00:18:51,450 --> 00:18:53,730
And this is 19, what, 84, 85.

303
00:18:54,660 --> 00:18:58,800
So what Youtube Youtube commentators
did was recreate this moment.

304
00:19:00,660 --> 00:19:03,870
They recreated this moment. I know
I'm going to date myself. Okay.

305
00:19:04,200 --> 00:19:06,600
And the 80s after I got out of school,

306
00:19:06,780 --> 00:19:09,740
I would gather my quarters from my,

307
00:19:09,900 --> 00:19:14,490
the pittance of my paper route
and I would head over to the,

308
00:19:14,550 --> 00:19:18,720
to Jimmy smoke shop in new Britain,
Connecticut. It's a post industrial town,

309
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:22,020
not a lot of money to go around
and were just working class kids.

310
00:19:22,021 --> 00:19:24,210
And we had quarters and
we didn't have Atari.

311
00:19:24,450 --> 00:19:27,780
So we would go to the
arcade and play video games,

312
00:19:27,870 --> 00:19:32,220
things like a lag or a pac man or whatever
and meet other people and talk about

313
00:19:32,221 --> 00:19:33,620
the games and learn how,

314
00:19:33,750 --> 00:19:38,430
how to better play the game and
develop culture in situ on site. Right.

315
00:19:38,940 --> 00:19:42,360
Um, maybe meet some cool older
kids who were much better at it.

316
00:19:42,390 --> 00:19:46,720
We would even cheer and we would
tribalized right. Ah, you're,

317
00:19:46,721 --> 00:19:51,570
have you like Bob's way of
playing Pac man? He's a punk. Uh,

318
00:19:51,720 --> 00:19:54,120
all these things were real,
but in flesh and bomb,

319
00:19:54,210 --> 00:19:56,160
the culture existed in flesh and Bonk.
Right.

320
00:19:56,340 --> 00:20:00,570
And we got to talk shit to each other.
We got to call each other names,

321
00:20:01,020 --> 00:20:04,500
um, calling each other's moms
names, whatever it was, right.

322
00:20:04,530 --> 00:20:07,590
Instead of going to play basketball,
maybe cause we used to do that.

323
00:20:07,591 --> 00:20:09,330
You have them anyway.
Play basketball on the city.

324
00:20:09,870 --> 00:20:14,130
If you play basketball in inner city,
talking smack is like a skill. Okay.

325
00:20:14,131 --> 00:20:18,400
So if you, if you don't
talk smack, you saw it,

326
00:20:18,430 --> 00:20:20,910
just you or even worse, you know. Uh,

327
00:20:20,911 --> 00:20:25,680
so you had the talk yet talk smack.
That was how it was.

328
00:20:25,680 --> 00:20:27,360
And if you could read,
if I wish I could,

329
00:20:27,900 --> 00:20:31,170
I wish there were a cam quarters back
then or cell phones that I could record it

330
00:20:31,171 --> 00:20:35,340
because I, it, it existed.
Youtube created that again,

331
00:20:35,910 --> 00:20:39,420
not in the same way. It wasn't flushing
born. It wasn't at the same time. It was,

332
00:20:39,421 --> 00:20:43,210
you know, um, across time zones and in,

333
00:20:43,410 --> 00:20:47,040
but you got to talk a lot of crap.
You got to cheer for your friends,

334
00:20:47,150 --> 00:20:50,230
got to do all these things. Uh,
and you got to meet New People.

335
00:20:50,680 --> 00:20:53,290
So Youtube when we created this,

336
00:20:53,470 --> 00:20:57,820
I don't know if they did it inadvertently
or whether the gamers who were putting

337
00:20:57,821 --> 00:20:59,680
the stuff up there knew it,
this is what they were doing.

338
00:20:59,681 --> 00:21:01,450
Or maybe it's just the
way the medium works.

339
00:21:01,451 --> 00:21:04,750
But this is one of the reasons
why it also works, right?

340
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:08,410
Because whatever it is
about video game culture,

341
00:21:08,411 --> 00:21:13,411
this kind of competitive play and come
ridership and smack talky existed before

342
00:21:15,280 --> 00:21:18,700
just not online. It
exists. So just reproduced.

343
00:21:18,730 --> 00:21:22,420
So that's another thing that it afforded
that the platform afforded, right?

344
00:21:22,690 --> 00:21:27,400
Importing external cultures, that's
really important. Uh, uh, practices.

345
00:21:28,780 --> 00:21:32,870
So does anybody recognize
any of this era plate?

346
00:21:32,890 --> 00:21:36,040
So I'm think talking about one particular
game because it was sort of the most

347
00:21:36,041 --> 00:21:40,420
popular game of the time, uh, on the
Xbox and playstation platforms, right?

348
00:21:40,421 --> 00:21:45,210
Modern warfare series. Okay.
Y'all play video games,

349
00:21:45,240 --> 00:21:50,040
I'm assuming. And some gay video
games just have elements of suck,

350
00:21:50,430 --> 00:21:53,160
right?
They might be great in some respects,

351
00:21:53,161 --> 00:21:54,970
but there are other elements
that just stank and you,

352
00:21:54,971 --> 00:21:57,690
you know it when you're
playing it and you think, God,

353
00:21:57,691 --> 00:22:02,360
I wish I could just tell the designers
how has it just socks or, um,

354
00:22:02,470 --> 00:22:03,450
talk to somebody about how much,

355
00:22:03,451 --> 00:22:08,340
so this is a little poster of the most
hated elements of modern warfare two and

356
00:22:08,341 --> 00:22:12,150
I'm going to focus on this one,
boosting a, if you've played this game,

357
00:22:12,180 --> 00:22:14,700
I'll give you the game
mechanic real quickly. Uh,

358
00:22:15,150 --> 00:22:17,740
let's say you're in competitive
play and someone, you know, you get,

359
00:22:17,770 --> 00:22:20,640
you get knocked out on the competition,
respond back in,

360
00:22:21,060 --> 00:22:24,180
but there's a thing you can attack in
certain places. You, you break the stick,

361
00:22:24,181 --> 00:22:27,740
you put it down and you will respond
exactly where that insert was located.

362
00:22:27,870 --> 00:22:29,820
Great. You get, you
get, you get to respond.

363
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:33,350
But people started doing that so they
can get kill streaks so he can get an

364
00:22:33,660 --> 00:22:37,230
award so that you would get your buddy
to show up in there and online play and

365
00:22:37,231 --> 00:22:39,480
you'd sit or cabin a corner,
you know,

366
00:22:40,470 --> 00:22:42,450
sneaky in this crack this thing.

367
00:22:42,451 --> 00:22:44,700
And then you shoot each other in the
head a couple of times and just keep

368
00:22:44,701 --> 00:22:46,230
spawning.
There's a ridiculous right.

369
00:22:46,231 --> 00:22:49,410
And it was game breaking because you
sitting there playing the game, you're,

370
00:22:49,540 --> 00:22:52,050
you're super competitive,
you're doing it and then you hear

371
00:22:54,340 --> 00:22:56,760
and you hear it in the sand because you
have your headset to cause your bass

372
00:22:56,761 --> 00:22:58,420
player. Right? Cause you,
you know what you're doing,

373
00:22:58,421 --> 00:23:02,460
you have your surrounds it and you
thinking who the hell is cheating?

374
00:23:02,461 --> 00:23:04,470
So you started trolling going on the map.

375
00:23:04,510 --> 00:23:08,730
You few forget the objective of the
game because you know someone's in some

376
00:23:08,731 --> 00:23:10,710
corner of shooting,
you know cheating.

377
00:23:11,100 --> 00:23:14,190
So you go around and you're looking
around and you find the realize they're

378
00:23:14,191 --> 00:23:15,900
cheating and all don't
she where she could test.

379
00:23:15,901 --> 00:23:17,640
So you get to go in the
lobby and talk about it,

380
00:23:17,641 --> 00:23:21,210
but not no more talking about it no more.
Let's say you get until,

381
00:23:23,970 --> 00:23:28,620
Oh let me make sure this is science cause
this guy gets pretty serious about it.

382
00:23:36,870 --> 00:23:40,240
Is he a boy? It's slow. Oh there it is.

383
00:23:40,540 --> 00:23:45,190
So this kind of made a series of
videos on tracking these cheaters.

384
00:23:46,190 --> 00:23:50,590
And you know, making their lives
difficult, uh, for cheating. So he,

385
00:23:50,690 --> 00:23:55,070
but he was pretty exciting. He did it
pretty interesting Joe about it. Um,

386
00:23:55,740 --> 00:23:57,350
I want to race him just
a little bit kiss maybe.

387
00:23:59,410 --> 00:24:02,700
Uh,

388
00:24:06,430 --> 00:24:09,160
and he's a fan of hard rock.
So chat looking who hey on that.

389
00:24:10,320 --> 00:24:14,420
So he would find his chairs
and, and little corners of
that map and put and put,

390
00:24:14,820 --> 00:24:15,320
put the,

391
00:24:15,320 --> 00:24:18,800
put the hurting on him and really creative
ways like throwing sand tax at, um,

392
00:24:20,320 --> 00:24:23,380
and you, you understand, you share
the ovary, that's Duke Nukem.

393
00:24:23,800 --> 00:24:26,990
So not only was she used
a number of interaction,

394
00:24:28,640 --> 00:24:31,630
not only what he, this is awesome.
And he was on Justin TV by the way.

395
00:24:31,660 --> 00:24:36,310
So he was on the first live streamers. I'm
just in TV circa 2009. Um, sorry. Yeah.

396
00:24:37,540 --> 00:24:42,130
So his thing was,
his said became entertained.

397
00:24:42,160 --> 00:24:45,670
So this moment that you had in
video game culture, right, and the,

398
00:24:45,790 --> 00:24:50,110
and you're playing at home or playing
with friends of hating on the game became

399
00:24:50,111 --> 00:24:53,560
entertainment for you. Right.
Who here has ever had some,

400
00:24:53,740 --> 00:24:58,000
who here has gone to the dentist and
felt, you know, and had a terribly nickel,

401
00:24:58,120 --> 00:24:59,080
particularly painful,

402
00:24:59,081 --> 00:25:03,010
then that's just experience and then
gone online and watched other people have

403
00:25:03,011 --> 00:25:07,120
it and laughed hysterically. And I don't
know, maybe you're crazy like that,

404
00:25:07,121 --> 00:25:10,310
but I haven't. But this, that's the idea.

405
00:25:10,410 --> 00:25:13,900
It took something that was a user
experience, right? In video games,

406
00:25:13,901 --> 00:25:16,000
I was objectionable.
I, someone's cheating.

407
00:25:16,001 --> 00:25:18,310
People get angry and made entertainment.

408
00:25:18,320 --> 00:25:22,090
It made the kind of TV
journalist called people, uh, uh,

409
00:25:22,210 --> 00:25:24,580
characters you love to hate.
Right?

410
00:25:25,060 --> 00:25:30,060
So that was afforded by the platform
and the creativity of the user.

411
00:25:30,550 --> 00:25:31,420
But think of what,

412
00:25:31,510 --> 00:25:35,500
how many intellectual property products
went into that particular cut. There's,

413
00:25:35,560 --> 00:25:36,393
there's,
uh,

414
00:25:36,580 --> 00:25:40,510
some rock music and I think she used
to use Metallica until the copyright

415
00:25:40,511 --> 00:25:45,310
strikes started coming in
Berlin town, right? Uh, he's
using Duke Nukem voiceovers,

416
00:25:45,820 --> 00:25:49,750
you know, like a tasty, right?
Things like that. And that comes,

417
00:25:49,751 --> 00:25:51,460
that's an intellectual property product.

418
00:25:51,490 --> 00:25:56,010
And I don't know if youtube has an Algo
to be recognize those kinds of, uh,

419
00:25:56,020 --> 00:25:59,770
sound inputs, but that's still
going. So I don't think so. Um,

420
00:25:59,800 --> 00:26:04,300
so these are a number of Loosey Goosey
applications of transformative works,

421
00:26:04,301 --> 00:26:06,910
right? Um, to make that happen.

422
00:26:07,210 --> 00:26:12,210
Now I've been talking about features that
keep cobbled together and media can be

423
00:26:13,430 --> 00:26:16,660
a cobbled together in a platform that
allows all this to happen, right?

424
00:26:16,870 --> 00:26:19,420
But it's not just one platform
is a number of platforms.

425
00:26:19,480 --> 00:26:23,470
Think of it as a brick collage. That
was pretty fancy word for a gaming guy.

426
00:26:23,830 --> 00:26:26,380
So it, it just means like
a, a hodgepodge, right?

427
00:26:26,381 --> 00:26:28,630
You put it all together to make this one.

428
00:26:28,780 --> 00:26:33,780
So think of the experience of this
sort of creating a 14 play as a,

429
00:26:36,050 --> 00:26:40,900
a collage of features. It's, it's bigger
than the one than the one platform.

430
00:26:41,260 --> 00:26:45,390
If the plastic, here's Twitter, right?
I mean, come on. How many, you know,

431
00:26:45,391 --> 00:26:49,290
youtube has his Twitter, you can set
a little Twitter icon there somewhere.

432
00:26:50,280 --> 00:26:51,090
Um,

433
00:26:51,090 --> 00:26:55,290
how often has this happened that
a platform is just entirely of,

434
00:26:55,291 --> 00:27:00,291
any media is open to other inputs
from other media that's really unique.

435
00:27:00,830 --> 00:27:05,790
That is not something that happens often.
And there might be some cases,

436
00:27:05,791 --> 00:27:08,310
but I think in mass media, and I
always, when I say it's unique,

437
00:27:08,311 --> 00:27:11,550
I say it's unique and meet it
mass me to do not have this uh,

438
00:27:11,760 --> 00:27:15,540
traditional mass media, digital media
because of the network environment.

439
00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:20,250
Do have it. So let me scroll here.
So my notes, I'm staying on track.

440
00:27:20,370 --> 00:27:22,740
Yes I am. Okay, good. All right.

441
00:27:24,330 --> 00:27:28,830
This allowed for a certain
kind of narrative to evolve

442
00:27:30,660 --> 00:27:34,980
when you hear a story or when you read
a story, right? It's to book, right?

443
00:27:35,220 --> 00:27:37,360
Or it's the, it's the
podcast. So it's the radio.

444
00:27:38,250 --> 00:27:41,670
What if the story stopped at the book?
I said follow,

445
00:27:41,730 --> 00:27:43,380
follow the rest of the story on Twitter.

446
00:27:43,520 --> 00:27:48,000
I follow the [inaudible] study on Youtube.
So that is the idea.

447
00:27:48,001 --> 00:27:50,060
I'm trying to get at that.
The narratives,

448
00:27:50,070 --> 00:27:53,490
the stories that they were told
through this video language,

449
00:27:53,850 --> 00:27:58,850
we're not just confined to the
one they were across platforms.

450
00:27:59,190 --> 00:28:02,880
So the plasticity is not just
about all of the features sets,

451
00:28:02,881 --> 00:28:05,620
it's about the ways in
which the one mass that's,

452
00:28:05,650 --> 00:28:07,170
we'll call it the central platform.

453
00:28:07,171 --> 00:28:12,000
Youtube allowed the other one's in and
out and so allowed users to flow through

454
00:28:12,360 --> 00:28:16,740
right there.
My favorite example is the Twitter beef.

455
00:28:17,190 --> 00:28:21,360
I love Twitter beefs. They're
so fun. So these commentators,

456
00:28:21,370 --> 00:28:25,590
which each Twitter beef, they start
hating on each other on Twitter, right?

457
00:28:26,100 --> 00:28:31,100
Like in high school or middle school
you hated on each other and the English

458
00:28:31,501 --> 00:28:34,920
class and then you went outside
and settle your differences.

459
00:28:34,921 --> 00:28:39,090
Or maybe you challenge each other to a
dual, I don't know, whatever it was this,

460
00:28:39,130 --> 00:28:43,890
they would start Twitter be so here on
Twitter and then the story would continue

461
00:28:43,891 --> 00:28:47,940
somewhere in the channel where they would
have themselves some, some, some heat,

462
00:28:47,970 --> 00:28:51,900
go back and forth and then they would
go somewhere else. Then it would go to,

463
00:28:51,901 --> 00:28:56,670
on the comments section is there,
this was staged in a lot of cases.

464
00:28:56,671 --> 00:28:59,830
They just had called each other up. We
were actually good friends and they say,

465
00:28:59,831 --> 00:29:00,661
why don't we,
you know,

466
00:29:00,661 --> 00:29:05,040
our viewers of viewership is a little
down or why don't we stage some drama?

467
00:29:06,240 --> 00:29:09,090
And it would,
but it had flow throughout.

468
00:29:09,091 --> 00:29:11,120
So let's say you're at school
and you're wondering, well,

469
00:29:11,370 --> 00:29:14,460
how much hate Barb is
giving the Jan today?

470
00:29:14,730 --> 00:29:18,660
So you go on Twitter and various sort
of firing up your, your video, right?

471
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:22,080
A youtube APP. You just kind of go on
Twitter and see where the heat is at.

472
00:29:22,440 --> 00:29:24,710
He out,
unfortunately I'm using here,

473
00:29:24,730 --> 00:29:28,340
doesn't like sometimes it
was collaboration and some
sort of like projects that

474
00:29:28,350 --> 00:29:32,250
they were working on. So these things
are, but it wouldn't be possible.

475
00:29:32,430 --> 00:29:36,950
This sort of multimodal narrative about,
uh, of one media product when you parcel,

476
00:29:37,020 --> 00:29:41,010
unless there was this plasticity
civilly link things together. Um,

477
00:29:41,890 --> 00:29:46,050
so users are like kittens,
um,

478
00:29:47,080 --> 00:29:50,110
especially when they're given a
significant amount of freedom.

479
00:29:50,470 --> 00:29:53,200
They will create things,
they will mess things up.

480
00:29:53,201 --> 00:29:56,800
Sometimes they will import
things that you didn't expect,

481
00:29:57,250 --> 00:30:01,180
but there will also be super
cute, uh, like kittens. No,

482
00:30:01,240 --> 00:30:02,530
maybe not sort of super cute,

483
00:30:02,560 --> 00:30:06,070
but they will also put together things
that you did not expect they will create

484
00:30:06,220 --> 00:30:09,180
for you. All right. Um,

485
00:30:10,630 --> 00:30:15,630
my summary of this and the narratives
that evolve will be multimodal.

486
00:30:16,330 --> 00:30:20,170
Uh,
it's a real interesting way to look at it.

487
00:30:20,200 --> 00:30:22,150
And in terms of discrete infinity,

488
00:30:22,870 --> 00:30:27,870
that all these different elements to
the platforms that you put together,

489
00:30:29,790 --> 00:30:32,830
the, does anybody here, does everybody
know the term, the screen infinity?

490
00:30:33,010 --> 00:30:38,010
Maybe this great infinity is the idea
that you have limited modules but infinite

491
00:30:38,021 --> 00:30:42,340
possibilities, right? Limited
components, infant outputs.

492
00:30:42,670 --> 00:30:47,530
It's a term from linguistics to explain
why limited number of phenoms or letters

493
00:30:47,531 --> 00:30:49,900
can produce infinite number of words,
right?

494
00:30:49,900 --> 00:30:52,330
Or it's also in AI and
limited number of circuitry.

495
00:30:52,331 --> 00:30:56,350
Yours things crews on indeterminate
number of outputs. All right?

496
00:30:56,980 --> 00:31:01,150
So
if you can create a modular

497
00:31:02,830 --> 00:31:07,540
platform that affords playfulness,
not only with its feature set,

498
00:31:07,600 --> 00:31:11,680
but also with the way the content
is mashed up and other platforms,

499
00:31:11,920 --> 00:31:13,690
you will have discrete infinity,

500
00:31:14,070 --> 00:31:17,980
you will have a near infinite
resource for creativity.

501
00:31:18,460 --> 00:31:22,990
That's my hypothesis. That's
my findings. I think I,

502
00:31:23,320 --> 00:31:27,310
things happen in these platforms that
I could never have expected and I don't

503
00:31:27,311 --> 00:31:30,310
think getting machine could ever
have computed the possibilities.

504
00:31:31,030 --> 00:31:32,470
So I love this image.

505
00:31:32,950 --> 00:31:37,330
This image is my metaphor
for well-designed platform.

506
00:31:37,360 --> 00:31:40,060
There are rules to this game that
these kids are playing, right?

507
00:31:40,440 --> 00:31:42,040
But there are nearly invisible to them.

508
00:31:42,460 --> 00:31:47,460
And the ball is the platform and they are
in conversation with that platform and

509
00:31:47,471 --> 00:31:50,980
that platform is in conversation with
them. It is adapting to them, right?

510
00:31:51,010 --> 00:31:54,010
They all kick it, right? They'll make
it go in one direction or another,

511
00:31:54,250 --> 00:31:55,990
but they're an effect.

512
00:31:56,020 --> 00:32:00,400
The game that they're playing
with it revolves around
the nearly invisible rules,

513
00:32:00,401 --> 00:32:01,660
which they all know,
right?

514
00:32:01,720 --> 00:32:04,600
Which they function within
and the physics of the ball,

515
00:32:04,930 --> 00:32:09,040
but also the magic that happens when
you're playing quickly and a ball goes

516
00:32:09,220 --> 00:32:13,060
somewhere on direct, uh, unexpected.
It's just the metaphor. All right,

517
00:32:13,061 --> 00:32:16,120
so what are the takeaways?
Let's say,

518
00:32:17,080 --> 00:32:21,970
what did we learn and how is it possible
you're the audience participation side

519
00:32:21,971 --> 00:32:25,390
of it also has a lot to do
with who is contributing.

520
00:32:27,430 --> 00:32:31,610
I cannot emphasize this enough,
these users,

521
00:32:31,630 --> 00:32:35,920
we're not thinking about copyright
strikes. They could not care less, right?

522
00:32:36,040 --> 00:32:41,030
They could not care less.
It was the latter. It only
was part of their imaginary.

523
00:32:41,480 --> 00:32:46,340
When they got a copyright
strike, channel's got shut
down. When music was pulled,

524
00:32:46,341 --> 00:32:47,300
for whatever reason,

525
00:32:47,301 --> 00:32:50,090
one of my videos was yanked when
on my channel because I decided,

526
00:32:50,120 --> 00:32:54,470
I decided to use, it's beginning to
look a lot like Christmas. Right?

527
00:32:54,471 --> 00:32:57,660
And it lasted 24 hours before I got
yanked on my channel because, well,

528
00:32:57,760 --> 00:32:59,930
there's a copyright strike on it.
So,

529
00:32:59,931 --> 00:33:03,620
but I care because all I know I have
to care about copyright. But these,

530
00:33:03,650 --> 00:33:04,970
these folks could do not.

531
00:33:05,420 --> 00:33:09,810
And that's the other thing that there
is some audiences, just our in state,

532
00:33:10,480 --> 00:33:14,880
maybe in life, right? 18 to 12, 12 to
18 year olds that just don't care. Um,

533
00:33:15,770 --> 00:33:17,570
and sometimes that's the
best place that there's a,

534
00:33:17,571 --> 00:33:20,960
there's a great book called the
art of not giving a shit. Um,

535
00:33:21,350 --> 00:33:26,350
and there's an element
to that in creativity and
gamers have that humans have

536
00:33:26,931 --> 00:33:30,920
that in the way hackers do, in the
positive way. Hackers that hacker,

537
00:33:30,921 --> 00:33:33,350
the majority of science, and
there's hackers, you know,

538
00:33:33,530 --> 00:33:36,740
curious folks who are tinkerers
who like to play with things.

539
00:33:37,250 --> 00:33:42,250
If you give those a culture
days playful with things,

540
00:33:42,830 --> 00:33:45,590
the ability to play with them, they
will create things for you, right?

541
00:33:45,950 --> 00:33:48,830
So these are my findings. Obviously
the intellectual property, uh,

542
00:33:49,790 --> 00:33:53,360
narrative and the profit motive kicks
in some companies that are more than

543
00:33:53,361 --> 00:33:54,110
others,

544
00:33:54,110 --> 00:33:59,110
but ultimately I think the findings are
all that a belonging sense of belonging,

545
00:34:02,241 --> 00:34:07,241
a sense of ownership and freedom
of movement are the key elements.

546
00:34:07,460 --> 00:34:08,930
These things will limit them,

547
00:34:09,380 --> 00:34:13,490
but the corporate culture is
actually really important. All right?

548
00:34:13,491 --> 00:34:14,750
So things like copyright,

549
00:34:14,751 --> 00:34:18,650
things like contractual agreements with
your users from third party owners,

550
00:34:18,651 --> 00:34:23,360
these things will limit or create a
balance in the balance and the platform

551
00:34:23,361 --> 00:34:27,410
designer has to design
that balance into it. But

552
00:34:28,970 --> 00:34:32,390
the corporate culture has a lot to do
with it actually hacker culture as well.

553
00:34:33,080 --> 00:34:35,750
Um,
and of all this,

554
00:34:35,960 --> 00:34:40,600
of all the communities that I've studied
in my lifetime, online video game,

555
00:34:40,890 --> 00:34:45,230
a video game,
players are a lot like hackers,

556
00:34:46,070 --> 00:34:48,920
um,
and the corporate culture.

557
00:34:50,830 --> 00:34:55,420
Does anybody here ever modded a
video game? So I was right. So

558
00:34:58,060 --> 00:35:03,040
video game industry has been really
open to letting its trade secrets and

559
00:35:03,041 --> 00:35:06,190
intellectual properties out of the door,
right?

560
00:35:06,760 --> 00:35:10,090
That's hacker culture in
its, in its essence, right?

561
00:35:10,091 --> 00:35:14,440
Here's the source code hack away
at it lets you, I remember I hated,

562
00:35:15,160 --> 00:35:17,170
I didn't hate him,
I love the physics and quake three,

563
00:35:17,470 --> 00:35:19,900
but I kind of wanted to run
next to a missile sometimes. So,

564
00:35:19,901 --> 00:35:23,770
and I went in there and I hacked away at
it and I slowed the missile speed down.

565
00:35:24,220 --> 00:35:27,100
So then I would just sit there and run
next to a missile and they do crazy

566
00:35:27,101 --> 00:35:29,680
things because it was
fun to do it and people,

567
00:35:29,740 --> 00:35:33,310
and I put that modern mine
and people downloaded the mod.

568
00:35:33,790 --> 00:35:38,370
So the point is that
of all the industries,

569
00:35:38,430 --> 00:35:43,290
the media and the creative industries,
video game sense, it'd be a little less,

570
00:35:44,280 --> 00:35:48,720
a little more open to letting their
platforms be converted a little bit,

571
00:35:48,780 --> 00:35:53,100
the modified, right. So that new
creative things can happen. Uh,

572
00:35:53,310 --> 00:35:56,280
so corporate culture is important.
I would imagine.

573
00:35:56,880 --> 00:36:01,680
My dream platform for media
sharing is one that is modular,

574
00:36:01,980 --> 00:36:05,670
wondering which a user
can pick and choose.

575
00:36:05,671 --> 00:36:10,140
The kinds of presentations
that the kinds of formats, um,

576
00:36:10,530 --> 00:36:14,700
that he or she wants to present and how
they want to present them. And each page,

577
00:36:14,730 --> 00:36:19,440
each user page is you unique youtube
experience. It's still youtube,

578
00:36:19,441 --> 00:36:23,190
but it's Jane, Jane's Youtube. All right?

579
00:36:24,270 --> 00:36:26,550
So these are the three Cs of success,
right?

580
00:36:26,551 --> 00:36:29,820
And it was these three seniors
probably existed already.

581
00:36:29,821 --> 00:36:32,520
And if you've worked for you to be, you
probably know that they were doing this,

582
00:36:32,521 --> 00:36:35,070
but it wasn't obvious to,
to the viewership.

583
00:36:35,130 --> 00:36:38,820
But after following this community
for long enough, it is, to me,

584
00:36:39,210 --> 00:36:43,500
there's subscribers are the common,
the common currency,

585
00:36:43,940 --> 00:36:46,950
um, and that you have to have ways
of catching them or recruiting them,

586
00:36:47,020 --> 00:36:51,630
growing your audience. And that can be
done in a number of ways. The first is,

587
00:36:51,631 --> 00:36:56,130
of course, great content. Yes, people will
show up, but also you would like to show,

588
00:36:56,170 --> 00:37:01,010
uh, incentivize them to come.
So maybe giveaways. All right.

589
00:37:01,050 --> 00:37:06,030
Uh, so I, the first time, I think the
first time any user generated content,

590
00:37:06,410 --> 00:37:09,900
um,
for video games which showed up on the,

591
00:37:10,500 --> 00:37:11,730
on the homepage,

592
00:37:11,750 --> 00:37:16,040
the splash page or youtube
was when one gamer x jaws is,

593
00:37:16,041 --> 00:37:19,050
I had to do a giveaway and if
you rate comment as described,

594
00:37:19,200 --> 00:37:23,250
he would put your name. He was giving
away x boxes, I mean big giveaway.

595
00:37:23,251 --> 00:37:25,890
And I just like, oh, I'll give you
some like, uh, I'll give you candy. No,

596
00:37:26,250 --> 00:37:30,570
like big things.
And he started getting millions of views.

597
00:37:30,571 --> 00:37:34,740
His subscriber base tripled.
So he had a great catching strategy.

598
00:37:34,920 --> 00:37:37,770
He got a lot of hate for right
from the rest of the community.

599
00:37:37,770 --> 00:37:41,010
Cause it's supposed to be a meritocracy,
but there's other ways of catching it.

600
00:37:41,040 --> 00:37:42,490
You making,
uh,

601
00:37:42,660 --> 00:37:47,660
entertain content and to entertaining
content requires maybe staging a beef or

602
00:37:48,331 --> 00:37:52,470
some drama and people show up and
that catches them cashing them.

603
00:37:52,471 --> 00:37:54,180
That means you have to keep them right.

604
00:37:54,480 --> 00:37:57,450
And so that's engagement
through other platforms. Again,

605
00:37:57,451 --> 00:37:58,950
because the platform afforded it,

606
00:37:58,951 --> 00:38:01,320
they were able to put the little
Twitter out and tell them, hey,

607
00:38:01,321 --> 00:38:05,250
I'm going to be on or have a hosted
lobby. And lastly, caching him.

608
00:38:05,520 --> 00:38:07,200
And that is the partnership programs.

609
00:38:07,350 --> 00:38:09,960
Initially there were no partnership
programs initially. You know,

610
00:38:09,961 --> 00:38:13,740
you have to have certain number of
viewership. Once word got around,

611
00:38:13,920 --> 00:38:18,000
the profit motor really kicked
in for them. Um, but again,

612
00:38:18,001 --> 00:38:18,870
the platform afforded it.

613
00:38:18,871 --> 00:38:22,500
So what's the take them ultimately
concluding you fast questions if you have

614
00:38:22,501 --> 00:38:26,890
them is jazz fans. This is, uh,

615
00:38:27,380 --> 00:38:31,050
uh, a picture of the recording of
a miles Davis kind of blue, right?

616
00:38:31,200 --> 00:38:35,530
Some jazz fans considered this proof
of the existence of God. All right. Uh,

617
00:38:35,560 --> 00:38:40,070
because, uh, Ge, uh, David's
basically gave his, uh, his, uh,

618
00:38:40,150 --> 00:38:42,700
content,
key signatures and tempo.

619
00:38:42,701 --> 00:38:47,110
And then they went at it and
they created a tonal jazz and,

620
00:38:47,180 --> 00:38:50,710
and a number of settings.
Uh, creativity flow.

621
00:38:51,130 --> 00:38:54,850
That's because the platform, the
rules of the platform, the structure,

622
00:38:55,210 --> 00:38:58,020
we're fixed in tempo key,
right?

623
00:38:58,570 --> 00:39:00,580
But everything else was up to the players.

624
00:39:02,890 --> 00:39:03,940
And that if you,

625
00:39:03,941 --> 00:39:08,941
if I think if platform designers start
to see their users as players and afford

626
00:39:09,941 --> 00:39:12,880
play and just give basic directions,

627
00:39:13,180 --> 00:39:18,180
what will come out at the end
will be the next miles Davis,

628
00:39:18,430 --> 00:39:23,170
the next Michelangelo,
the next, um, whomever,

629
00:39:23,410 --> 00:39:25,240
right? Genius. If you have enough,

630
00:39:25,270 --> 00:39:28,810
if you will be happy or at least designers
will be happy that they built the

631
00:39:28,811 --> 00:39:30,070
tools,
they gave them,

632
00:39:30,071 --> 00:39:34,240
the canvases that they were able
to use to become those geniuses.

633
00:39:34,720 --> 00:39:39,400
Um, so that's the take home message is
the balance between structure and play.

634
00:39:40,090 --> 00:39:43,540
And we've seen users as playful agents,

635
00:39:43,870 --> 00:39:47,290
not as folks that you need to shut today.

636
00:39:47,380 --> 00:39:49,060
You need to structure
their behavior too much.

637
00:39:49,061 --> 00:39:52,600
And the video game commentary community
and the beginning historically really

638
00:39:52,601 --> 00:39:57,601
showed that twitch is a
lot of ways doing crazy,

639
00:39:59,130 --> 00:40:04,050
not crazy things. I would say they're
structures are far looser. I see.

640
00:40:04,060 --> 00:40:07,890
I've seen things on twitch.
I mean I've been having,

641
00:40:07,910 --> 00:40:12,550
looking at the web for 20 years, um,
that made my jaw drop. I'm like, wow.

642
00:40:12,580 --> 00:40:16,480
And they, they've monetized it. Um,
so the content can be loosey Goosey.

643
00:40:16,481 --> 00:40:18,790
Sometimes it's,
it's problematic.

644
00:40:18,791 --> 00:40:21,940
But those that's sort of the price.

645
00:40:21,941 --> 00:40:25,320
You sometimes pay a more,
more,

646
00:40:25,570 --> 00:40:27,370
you have to curate a little
bit more effectively.

647
00:40:27,910 --> 00:40:29,050
And when you're going to let go,

648
00:40:29,130 --> 00:40:31,660
may I create a little bit more
chaos that your users do? What apps?

649
00:40:32,380 --> 00:40:36,750
That's the take home message.
That's how a platform affords play and um,

650
00:40:37,120 --> 00:40:40,180
balances between the structure and the,
uh,

651
00:40:41,620 --> 00:40:45,220
the ghost in the shell.
Any questions,

652
00:40:46,210 --> 00:40:47,480
comments?
Yeah,

653
00:40:48,240 --> 00:40:51,780
we would talk about your experience or
comment on kind of like how you think,

654
00:40:52,500 --> 00:40:57,210
like things in the flesh now are kind
of like real life game play and kind of

655
00:40:57,211 --> 00:40:59,140
ties in with all these
concepts you're talking about.

656
00:40:59,280 --> 00:41:01,640
Yeah, I think, you know, one of the,

657
00:41:01,760 --> 00:41:05,310
one of the mistakes I think a lot of
internet scholars do a is thing that,

658
00:41:05,311 --> 00:41:08,670
you know, the culture is self contained,
right? But a lot of live action role play,

659
00:41:08,671 --> 00:41:09,330
right?

660
00:41:09,330 --> 00:41:14,330
So in those cases you are taking ganging
scenarios and putting them elsewhere,

661
00:41:14,670 --> 00:41:17,670
right?
And live action and carrying them out.

662
00:41:18,060 --> 00:41:23,060
And sometimes a game mechanics
are flawed in the game.

663
00:41:24,420 --> 00:41:28,770
We've, you know, we've had, at least
the group I did it with was, uh,

664
00:41:29,430 --> 00:41:31,890
was a, uh, failed failed feature.

665
00:41:31,891 --> 00:41:36,710
Larb so it would be something
like a, um, ridiculous, like,

666
00:41:36,740 --> 00:41:41,720
uh, the, in modern warfare two, it
was a second chance where, you know,

667
00:41:41,721 --> 00:41:43,760
the guy sitting there like,
you shot him a thousand times,

668
00:41:43,761 --> 00:41:46,400
but he's still kinda can get at you
and that's everybody considered a fail.

669
00:41:46,401 --> 00:41:48,890
So one person got a ticket that was like,

670
00:41:48,891 --> 00:41:52,730
you get to be that guy that ruins it
for everybody and nobody knew, right?

671
00:41:52,970 --> 00:41:54,490
So it affects, you know, it, it,

672
00:41:54,491 --> 00:41:59,000
it created this and it reinforced
the meaning that we had in the game.

673
00:41:59,180 --> 00:41:59,900
Right?

674
00:41:59,900 --> 00:42:04,760
Or sometimes we would do something in
Larb that we would then carry into the

675
00:42:04,761 --> 00:42:08,120
game, right? There would
be one guy who'd be, um,

676
00:42:09,710 --> 00:42:12,380
uh, you know, instead of, instead of, uh,

677
00:42:12,470 --> 00:42:16,790
instead of it being as a team death match,

678
00:42:16,850 --> 00:42:21,710
one guy would activate a grenade
instead of running around,

679
00:42:21,711 --> 00:42:23,660
you know, and they're going
to blow up on you soon, right?

680
00:42:23,661 --> 00:42:27,710
So he was the guy you had to find. Uh,
but that's something we had done in labs.

681
00:42:27,760 --> 00:42:29,220
So, if that's what you mean. Yeah.

682
00:42:29,221 --> 00:42:34,221
So there is this fluency between external
cultures and internal culture in the

683
00:42:34,491 --> 00:42:39,410
game and the fact that we could
do it outside and bring it into,

684
00:42:40,010 --> 00:42:44,870
let's say lobby recorded and then put
it on and became a genre onto itself.

685
00:42:44,870 --> 00:42:45,111
Right?

686
00:42:45,111 --> 00:42:47,810
So there were some lobbies you would
walk in and they weren't actually playing

687
00:42:48,110 --> 00:42:49,220
the objective of the game.

688
00:42:49,460 --> 00:42:52,460
They were playing an objective
they had devised somewhere else.

689
00:42:52,700 --> 00:42:55,940
So you went into search and destroy
and it wasn't searching to start with

690
00:42:55,941 --> 00:42:57,620
something else.
Um,

691
00:42:57,650 --> 00:43:01,400
you went into team death match to replace
something else and that was the two.

692
00:43:01,430 --> 00:43:05,510
So creativity, right. Did designers
never met the game to be that,

693
00:43:06,350 --> 00:43:10,410
but someone, some group
in Lockton are that, um,

694
00:43:10,610 --> 00:43:15,020
or they reinforce some sort of
notion of what the game should be?

695
00:43:15,610 --> 00:43:17,550
So I think that's what
you mean. Yes. Yeah.

696
00:43:18,170 --> 00:43:21,140
These are the conversations
between the external and internal.

697
00:43:21,350 --> 00:43:23,780
The flushing bond on the digital.
I really important.

698
00:43:24,440 --> 00:43:27,950
And if the platform allows for that
and the fandom allows for that,

699
00:43:27,951 --> 00:43:31,620
then you have an opening door
for creative spaces. Yeah.

700
00:43:33,740 --> 00:43:35,940
Yeah. Slab action, write
plays create really fun.

701
00:43:36,330 --> 00:43:37,650
Yeah. I mean, I guess in general,

702
00:43:37,651 --> 00:43:42,651
like I'm very curious about
like how things manifest
in like in real life or how

703
00:43:44,791 --> 00:43:48,240
like what can be done in real
life that can or cannot read,

704
00:43:48,241 --> 00:43:52,690
but we replicate it like on a digital
platform. So what would that be like Lara?

705
00:43:52,700 --> 00:43:56,730
Absorb like args um, like
immersive theater, you know,

706
00:43:56,731 --> 00:43:59,040
like what are the applications
of it and like, you know,

707
00:43:59,041 --> 00:44:02,280
if you're thinking about the form of
theater itself is something that may

708
00:44:02,281 --> 00:44:04,650
arguably be like somewhat fizzling out,
right?

709
00:44:04,651 --> 00:44:08,130
Like what does it look like when you
inject these new ideas and do it right?

710
00:44:08,680 --> 00:44:13,660
I think audience participation. So
for example, if, um, video game,

711
00:44:13,661 --> 00:44:15,520
right? When when I, when we were in,

712
00:44:15,730 --> 00:44:20,080
in the arcades and we were
participating in the game play,

713
00:44:20,320 --> 00:44:21,430
if someone were to tell you,

714
00:44:21,820 --> 00:44:26,320
would you ever really watch someone
on TV or on play a video game,

715
00:44:26,360 --> 00:44:27,910
people are going to
know. But actually, yeah,

716
00:44:27,911 --> 00:44:31,590
people were doing it for a long time for
watching other people play games for a

717
00:44:31,591 --> 00:44:35,610
long time. Right. Uh, so the idea is find,

718
00:44:36,060 --> 00:44:41,060
find media engagement exercises if
people do together in which others,

719
00:44:42,240 --> 00:44:45,600
others take joy in watching
others do. Right? We all watch,

720
00:44:45,810 --> 00:44:49,770
we all love watching other people
fail at sports height way. It's just,

721
00:44:49,771 --> 00:44:53,970
it's comedy, right? We watched
and we watched and just epic
fail, epically fail. Uh,

722
00:44:54,150 --> 00:44:57,830
we can't play the sport. We are
probably worse than they are. Uh,

723
00:44:57,950 --> 00:45:00,060
they're not as good,
but we like watching that.

724
00:45:00,510 --> 00:45:05,220
So those are the things that I think
people pour into the, let's say,

725
00:45:05,420 --> 00:45:07,650
a video experience when it's
a flesh and bone experience,

726
00:45:08,130 --> 00:45:13,130
when there is an element of
enjoyment and viewership on another.

727
00:45:13,201 --> 00:45:15,690
So theater, right? Um,

728
00:45:16,530 --> 00:45:20,620
I can't think of any other
than sort of sports fails. Uh,

729
00:45:20,970 --> 00:45:23,150
or,
yeah,

730
00:45:23,160 --> 00:45:26,720
sports shows me the first thing that
comes to mind where people like,

731
00:45:26,721 --> 00:45:30,630
like to watch other folks sort of fumble
on themselves. Trip triple level. Uh,

732
00:45:31,510 --> 00:45:33,750
and if that's what you mean
in terms of performances,

733
00:45:34,320 --> 00:45:38,400
I think that's as close as I can get.
But in video games,

734
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:41,490
um,
children playing with the,

735
00:45:41,491 --> 00:45:45,750
we has anyone seen a small child who
does not yet have full control of their

736
00:45:45,751 --> 00:45:49,260
motor skills play with a Weise thick,
they beat each other with it.

737
00:45:49,590 --> 00:45:53,040
It's hilarious. I wish that
was on youtube, right? Uh,

738
00:45:53,130 --> 00:45:56,640
I know children but things like
that where it was a family moment.

739
00:45:56,640 --> 00:45:57,391
It was hilarious.

740
00:45:57,391 --> 00:46:00,810
A little Bobby just whacked Jimmy over
the head with that damn stick. And you,

741
00:46:00,811 --> 00:46:03,180
you're lucky you have that little
rubber thing on it. But it's,

742
00:46:03,181 --> 00:46:07,830
it's these elements of like that video
game culture that only happens in video

743
00:46:07,831 --> 00:46:09,240
because the kids get fired up about it.

744
00:46:09,570 --> 00:46:14,370
But there might be other elements in and
participatory culture in theater or in

745
00:46:14,930 --> 00:46:19,170
uh, music, right. Music
fails are great as well.

746
00:46:19,171 --> 00:46:22,630
I know fails and focusing on fails,
but they tend to be funny. And I got,

747
00:46:22,631 --> 00:46:25,650
I got beaten in the face one time
with a baseball. Everybody laughed,

748
00:46:25,651 --> 00:46:28,020
including myself, you know, it's
just like, okay, just got beat.

749
00:46:28,920 --> 00:46:32,880
So fails tend to be kind of funny.
It's slapstick.

750
00:46:34,170 --> 00:46:36,390
Any questions? Comments? Yes.

751
00:46:39,460 --> 00:46:43,090
So you talked about a video
game community as well. Um,

752
00:46:43,091 --> 00:46:45,880
so there's communities on Reddit,
there's communities on twitch,

753
00:46:45,881 --> 00:46:46,900
streamer communities.

754
00:46:47,200 --> 00:46:52,160
Do you have any insights on what
makes a community successful? Okay,

755
00:46:52,250 --> 00:46:55,040
yes. Um, there has to be

756
00:46:57,710 --> 00:47:01,910
a common language, right? [inaudible] and
what I mean by language, some symbolic,

757
00:47:02,270 --> 00:47:02,571
right?

758
00:47:02,571 --> 00:47:07,571
So everybody comes to it with an already
existing experience and they discover

759
00:47:08,210 --> 00:47:11,840
that they all share that particular
symbolic experience and then they start to

760
00:47:11,841 --> 00:47:15,110
circulate it.
If it's a particularly robust experience,

761
00:47:15,350 --> 00:47:18,830
then that congeals a community
really quickly. Like for example,

762
00:47:18,831 --> 00:47:23,060
the Brownie example, they started on
Reddit, right? Everybody had the general,

763
00:47:23,090 --> 00:47:26,000
these, every member of that community
had the general experience of loving that

764
00:47:26,001 --> 00:47:30,850
particular product and they didn't have
any place to present that until reddit

765
00:47:31,720 --> 00:47:34,060
and others affirmed it
and it was so strong.

766
00:47:34,061 --> 00:47:36,850
That connection there that can
do it almost instantaneously,

767
00:47:36,851 --> 00:47:38,920
that community came together.
Uh,

768
00:47:38,921 --> 00:47:40,870
so there has to be something
that ties in together,

769
00:47:41,020 --> 00:47:45,940
some sort of common symbology.
Right? And that's strength.

770
00:47:46,330 --> 00:47:49,360
Then there's also the dynamics.
Um,

771
00:47:50,680 --> 00:47:53,110
there is sometimes you know,

772
00:47:53,500 --> 00:47:58,500
roles emerging communities and at that
point you have the best communities are

773
00:47:59,081 --> 00:48:03,190
usually communities are tend to be
horizontal, they tend to congeal,

774
00:48:03,240 --> 00:48:08,230
the leadership is sparse.
So whenever someone starts to be a leader,

775
00:48:08,231 --> 00:48:12,870
too much of a leader, it tends to not
work out. That tends to sort of, you know,

776
00:48:12,880 --> 00:48:16,300
then people tribalized eco against each
others. There's beef, there's anger.

777
00:48:16,720 --> 00:48:21,640
So horizontal communities tend to be
a pretty effective common symbology,

778
00:48:21,641 --> 00:48:24,670
strong symbology. Um,
and the last of their,

779
00:48:24,671 --> 00:48:27,370
I think it keeps communities
together is persistent.

780
00:48:28,540 --> 00:48:30,730
So rest of the three big social proof,

781
00:48:30,810 --> 00:48:35,380
a reciprocity and
consistency tend to be re.

782
00:48:35,620 --> 00:48:39,760
So if they were start gifting in
the economy, that's a big deal.

783
00:48:40,870 --> 00:48:44,380
Uninvited gifts are a huge deal.

784
00:48:44,550 --> 00:48:47,260
Who here has been ever been
given an uninvited gift?

785
00:48:48,550 --> 00:48:51,040
How compelled where you, you
wanted to give back? Right.

786
00:48:52,090 --> 00:48:55,960
That is a very strong
social norm across cultural.

787
00:48:55,961 --> 00:49:00,100
It doesn't matter if someone gives you
something you immediately want to give.

788
00:49:00,101 --> 00:49:05,101
So that sort of a community in which
people are spontaneously gifting is really

789
00:49:05,741 --> 00:49:09,970
tied together. Reciprocity, that's
important, right? Social proof.

790
00:49:10,600 --> 00:49:15,600
If one particular element of the community
is affirmed by others that makes that

791
00:49:16,751 --> 00:49:21,070
particular element, um,
our grounding element.

792
00:49:21,071 --> 00:49:26,071
So everybody wears red on Thursdays
and everybody was more than few,

793
00:49:27,250 --> 00:49:31,620
then it becomes a thing that people
do. Right. So, and then consistency,

794
00:49:32,830 --> 00:49:35,470
a persistence of those things over time.

795
00:49:35,480 --> 00:49:38,170
That just means people have to practice
it over and over again and sticking to

796
00:49:38,171 --> 00:49:40,000
what they say.
I said I was going to do that.

797
00:49:40,390 --> 00:49:42,830
These reciprocity is probably
the strongest, you know,

798
00:49:43,080 --> 00:49:45,430
in a situation like that
information is a gift.

799
00:49:45,940 --> 00:49:49,370
So if you're in a community and you share
information that wasn't as useful for

800
00:49:49,371 --> 00:49:50,204
the community,

801
00:49:50,930 --> 00:49:51,763
Ooh,

802
00:49:52,450 --> 00:49:56,250
reciprocity immediately kicks in. So
those are the things. Thank you. Yep.

803
00:49:59,070 --> 00:50:02,350
What else? All right. All right.

804
00:50:02,470 --> 00:50:03,580
I have a question. Oh, go ahead.

805
00:50:03,880 --> 00:50:06,920
I'm not sure if you're familiar
with the video game split tune. Uh,

806
00:50:07,900 --> 00:50:10,540
it's been a while, but
yeah, with that one,

807
00:50:10,570 --> 00:50:14,560
there's some game modes that are actually
closed off at specific points in time

808
00:50:14,620 --> 00:50:17,940
and open up during certain periods
of time where certain days. Um,

809
00:50:18,250 --> 00:50:21,520
and I always find that fascinating
because it's like the game itself is

810
00:50:21,521 --> 00:50:23,530
restricting you from playing the game,

811
00:50:24,130 --> 00:50:27,870
but it seems to work really well
in terms of players get, uh,

812
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:30,980
during specific days and that there's
always someone to play against.

813
00:50:31,450 --> 00:50:35,480
And I think maybe some of that design
has actually been impacted by east sports

814
00:50:35,510 --> 00:50:39,740
culture because I think Splatoon is
often featured is one of Nintendo's key

815
00:50:39,741 --> 00:50:41,030
sports titles right now.

816
00:50:41,210 --> 00:50:46,010
So I was wondering how east sports
culture has influenced the design of video

817
00:50:46,011 --> 00:50:50,570
games over time and if there's any trends
in design that have resulted from that.

818
00:50:51,050 --> 00:50:51,883
Yes.

819
00:50:52,010 --> 00:50:56,900
Video Games since the e sports
and see Mlg crew hit, hit, hit,

820
00:50:56,940 --> 00:50:59,150
hit, hit the airwaves, right? Uh,

821
00:50:59,180 --> 00:51:04,180
they ha the designers will tap them for
ideas in terms of the kinds of play,

822
00:51:05,181 --> 00:51:09,560
the kinds of tech they might
want to use. Um, that has been,

823
00:51:09,860 --> 00:51:13,070
that's a mixed bag of success
and not as a player, right. As a,

824
00:51:13,160 --> 00:51:17,360
because East sports players require,
require fast twitch reflects,

825
00:51:17,710 --> 00:51:21,590
um, a particular type of competitive, um,

826
00:51:22,490 --> 00:51:26,670
tech technological interface that
a regular player may not. Right.

827
00:51:27,080 --> 00:51:27,710
Or,

828
00:51:27,710 --> 00:51:32,710
and so our user may not an that casual
user or a person or a very committed fan.

829
00:51:34,490 --> 00:51:38,220
I mean I find that particularly
use phone. Right. Um, I know, um,

830
00:51:38,930 --> 00:51:43,930
I remember commentary once where they
were asking the designers were asking some

831
00:51:44,361 --> 00:51:48,590
MLG players what they thought would be
great for call of duty and the community

832
00:51:48,591 --> 00:51:52,430
with what I'm saying. Yeah.
So it depends on what,

833
00:51:52,520 --> 00:51:55,400
what it might be in terms of that,
of the game.

834
00:51:55,401 --> 00:51:59,870
You mentioned the design element
also works to another very

835
00:52:01,420 --> 00:52:04,660
kind of sociologically grounded
way of seeing things. Um,

836
00:52:05,510 --> 00:52:06,500
exclusivity.

837
00:52:07,550 --> 00:52:12,550
So if content is delivered in
segments and you have to work for it,

838
00:52:14,570 --> 00:52:19,070
it makes that particular segment
of the content seem exclusive,

839
00:52:19,580 --> 00:52:23,100
that only a few people can get it.
That you have to go a certain distance.

840
00:52:23,420 --> 00:52:23,841
You know,
it's,

841
00:52:23,841 --> 00:52:27,770
you have to labor a little bit and
that creates all about a value to it.

842
00:52:28,220 --> 00:52:32,330
So Games are designed,
those kinds of systems, um,

843
00:52:32,390 --> 00:52:36,590
you'll see people laboring effectively,
you know, they call it the grind.

844
00:52:36,650 --> 00:52:40,640
People will grind and world of Warcraft
for a certain amount of hours, right?

845
00:52:40,641 --> 00:52:45,290
So they can get a certain amount
of like upper denture item. Um,

846
00:52:45,620 --> 00:52:50,600
but that's different I think.
I think where we saw the MLG,

847
00:52:50,660 --> 00:52:55,660
where I studied MLG thing really kick
in was in things like in video games,

848
00:52:56,180 --> 00:53:01,180
like call of duty or in
things as on trick shots.

849
00:53:01,760 --> 00:53:06,760
KDS or choke to death ratios or
things like on gear that you used.

850
00:53:08,510 --> 00:53:10,580
Oh, our Astros for example, um,

851
00:53:11,780 --> 00:53:16,460
surrounds on headsets because the Mlg
people use it. Everybody wanted to use it.

852
00:53:16,940 --> 00:53:19,250
Right? So those, those
are kind of like product,

853
00:53:19,251 --> 00:53:23,780
like straight up branding and product
placement and, um, endorsements.

854
00:53:24,320 --> 00:53:27,450
So yeah, but it informs,
but not absolutely.

855
00:53:30,810 --> 00:53:34,650
Okay. Last chance. All right.

856
00:53:36,030 --> 00:53:36,863
Thank you.

857
00:53:38,220 --> 00:53:42,840
[inaudible].
