1
00:00:06,070 --> 00:00:10,160
[inaudible]

2
00:00:10,260 --> 00:00:11,880
well,
thank you everyone for coming.

3
00:00:11,910 --> 00:00:16,860
It's a really special privilege and
honor for me actually to talk to Gary,

4
00:00:17,550 --> 00:00:21,840
in my opinion, my humble opinion, the
greatest chess player of all time.

5
00:00:22,230 --> 00:00:26,280
And um, you know, I've
really enjoyed his book,

6
00:00:26,310 --> 00:00:29,710
which a I reviewed recently and um,
in know of,

7
00:00:29,720 --> 00:00:33,470
is impressed with Gary's understanding
of artificial intelligence and a,

8
00:00:33,550 --> 00:00:35,820
the latest advances in that. So, you know,

9
00:00:35,821 --> 00:00:38,130
it's going to be great to talk
about that as well as chest today.

10
00:00:38,860 --> 00:00:43,030
Thank your Marketo demarche you'll review
it over would be all of the protection

11
00:00:43,060 --> 00:00:47,080
against all the tech guys that tried
to was this has to be for not being an

12
00:00:47,081 --> 00:00:47,750
expert.

13
00:00:47,750 --> 00:00:52,400
Well, I'm glad if that can be of use.
So, um, before we get talking about, uh,

14
00:00:52,570 --> 00:00:54,940
you know, um, blue match and now she'll,

15
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:57,800
everyone's going to want to hear about
your insights on that and also machine

16
00:00:57,801 --> 00:00:58,730
learning more generally.

17
00:00:59,030 --> 00:01:02,990
And I wanted to begin by asking you
about growing up as a chess champion in

18
00:01:02,991 --> 00:01:07,280
Soviet Union. Um, did you always
want to be a chess player,

19
00:01:07,340 --> 00:01:08,450
a world champion of chess?

20
00:01:08,451 --> 00:01:12,050
Did you consider anything else or were
you from a very young age decided that

21
00:01:12,051 --> 00:01:12,920
this was your path?

22
00:01:13,690 --> 00:01:15,030
Um,
I learned

23
00:01:17,100 --> 00:01:20,280
how to play chess when
I was five, four, six.

24
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:24,060
I'm sorry I couldn't give you an exact
moment. Nobody was there to tweet about it

25
00:01:25,870 --> 00:01:29,010
was late 68 [inaudible] 69.
Yeah.

26
00:01:29,011 --> 00:01:32,220
Watching my parents trying to
solve chess problem. And, um,

27
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:35,160
I love the game of foresight and,
um,

28
00:01:35,370 --> 00:01:39,660
ever since I'm still an old
was the game and uh, um, I,

29
00:01:39,780 --> 00:01:44,780
I could feel that was a match made in
heaven and everybody around also could see

30
00:01:44,971 --> 00:01:48,360
that a chess was a perfect feet for,
for my mind

31
00:01:48,540 --> 00:01:52,180
skills. Yeah. Yeah. And actually you
talk about in the book about chess,

32
00:01:52,181 --> 00:01:54,760
informing all of your thinking and
the rest of your life, right? Do you,

33
00:01:54,890 --> 00:01:55,870
what do you mean by that?

34
00:01:55,871 --> 00:02:00,220
What skills can you see yourself using
in the rest of your life that you love?

35
00:02:00,260 --> 00:02:01,093
Yes.

36
00:02:02,020 --> 00:02:06,910
Naturally, if you will engaged in, in, in
a competitive sport at such an early age,

37
00:02:07,270 --> 00:02:12,210
uh, you, you, you, you
see many things just, uh,

38
00:02:12,240 --> 00:02:16,930
uh, uh, as a reflection
of, of your chess games,

39
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:19,390
your engagement because
you have to play up to win.

40
00:02:19,720 --> 00:02:22,960
It means you have to change certain,
um,

41
00:02:23,170 --> 00:02:27,400
certain habits and certain
customers. Um, and, uh, um, uh,

42
00:02:27,430 --> 00:02:30,940
what was important for me, that's what
I learned from my mother is, is it's,

43
00:02:30,970 --> 00:02:34,690
my game was not just about winning.
It was also about making a difference.

44
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:39,930
And that's what helped me
to make a transition later
on in my life, uh, from a,

45
00:02:39,931 --> 00:02:44,650
um, playing chess being number one chess
player for 20 years to other things that

46
00:02:44,651 --> 00:02:45,484
I'm doing now.

47
00:02:45,730 --> 00:02:49,390
Not pretending that I could be number one
and repeat my outstanding achievements

48
00:02:49,391 --> 00:02:50,224
in the game of chess,

49
00:02:50,320 --> 00:02:54,400
but still recognizing that I'm quite
useful because I'm trying to, uh,

50
00:02:54,490 --> 00:02:59,260
um, um, uh, bring my chest experience, my,

51
00:02:59,350 --> 00:03:01,180
what I learned from the game of Chess,
uh,

52
00:03:01,750 --> 00:03:04,510
my analytical skills to make
the difference elsewhere.

53
00:03:04,910 --> 00:03:07,700
Sarabia. Oh yeah. We should,
we should talk about a,

54
00:03:07,701 --> 00:03:11,420
obviously the heart of your book, which
is that the deeply batch and you know,

55
00:03:11,421 --> 00:03:14,480
I was fascinated to see
your, your take on, you know,

56
00:03:14,481 --> 00:03:17,300
having gone through the Alpha go
matches ourselves on the other side.

57
00:03:17,480 --> 00:03:20,030
Your take on it from,
from the player's perspective.

58
00:03:20,310 --> 00:03:20,921
It's a,
it's a,

59
00:03:20,921 --> 00:03:24,010
it's an interesting story because when
we played our first match and I always

60
00:03:24,011 --> 00:03:28,330
want to remind people that the two
matches and I want the first one. Exactly.

61
00:03:28,360 --> 00:03:32,410
We should, we should make
that very clear. So exactly.

62
00:03:35,230 --> 00:03:37,870
The first match in
Philadelphia, uh, it just,

63
00:03:37,871 --> 00:03:40,830
it was organized as quite
a low level event. Uh,

64
00:03:41,110 --> 00:03:44,290
the corporation was not even
involved. Uh, it was, uh,

65
00:03:44,350 --> 00:03:49,350
ECM behind it and the team always wanted
to challenge me and I had an experience

66
00:03:50,320 --> 00:03:54,760
of playing was our plating is there, I
mean, 1989 when they had a deep thought,

67
00:03:55,160 --> 00:03:55,560
uh,

68
00:03:55,560 --> 00:04:00,280
the prototype from Carnegie Mellon that
they brought to IBM and it's turned into

69
00:04:00,510 --> 00:04:03,840
a deep blue project. Um, and um,

70
00:04:04,270 --> 00:04:06,790
everything has changed up the
game. One, which by the way,

71
00:04:06,791 --> 00:04:08,830
if we are talking about
a watershed moment,

72
00:04:09,010 --> 00:04:13,360
that was in February 90 96 in Philadelphia
when I lost game one of that match

73
00:04:13,570 --> 00:04:16,270
because the rest is, you may
argue, matter of technique,

74
00:04:16,271 --> 00:04:18,820
matter of time it was
like signing on the wall.

75
00:04:19,240 --> 00:04:22,510
If the machine could be the world
champion in one game, then eventually,

76
00:04:22,570 --> 00:04:27,010
eventually, yeah, I fought back, I won the
match. I want to get into and gain 500,

77
00:04:27,011 --> 00:04:31,930
game six. But it was pretty clear that
the rest will be measure of time. Um,

78
00:04:32,530 --> 00:04:37,450
and the first game, uh, had some kind
of record following on the Internet.

79
00:04:37,810 --> 00:04:39,370
I think it's,
they did the numbers they had,

80
00:04:39,371 --> 00:04:44,370
they will hide the numbers later on in
Atlanta that IBM run, uh, around, uh, um,

81
00:04:44,920 --> 00:04:49,330
uh, the, the website there.
And suddenly the corporation,

82
00:04:49,920 --> 00:04:50,760
a Google Sre,

83
00:04:50,770 --> 00:04:55,180
these team discovered the huge
potential at other relatively low cost.

84
00:04:55,510 --> 00:04:59,670
So, um, and uh, while the rest of the
match was still, you know, play to,

85
00:04:59,830 --> 00:05:04,480
it's just what, who chest, then it
turned into a big corporate endeavor.

86
00:05:04,540 --> 00:05:08,110
And, um, and I'm, look,
it's water under the bridge.

87
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:12,940
20 years ago I lost the match, but
I think, and I discovered the book,

88
00:05:12,970 --> 00:05:16,450
I made many mistakes in preparation
and one of the biggest mistake,

89
00:05:16,451 --> 00:05:19,870
and it's quite, you know, that's
why I was so upset with myself,

90
00:05:19,871 --> 00:05:24,871
is that I didn't treat the IBM
deep blue as just an appalling,

91
00:05:26,411 --> 00:05:30,250
the way you're treated Anatoly Karpov
where Vishy Anand or not too short for me,

92
00:05:30,251 --> 00:05:33,250
it was a still, um, in
this, I was still part of,

93
00:05:33,340 --> 00:05:37,960
of a great social and scientific
experiment of the end of the 20th century.

94
00:05:37,960 --> 00:05:41,140
So I'm seeing that could help us to
understand more about how we humans make

95
00:05:41,141 --> 00:05:45,400
decisions, how machines can play with
us. It's, it was not just, you know,

96
00:05:45,670 --> 00:05:48,620
winning or losing big
mistake. Yeah. Uh, uh,

97
00:05:48,850 --> 00:05:53,590
now for IBM would was just
about winning or losing care.
Yeah. And, uh, the, one of,

98
00:05:53,620 --> 00:05:58,310
one of the big mistakes that I made as
just as I, while signing the contract,

99
00:05:58,810 --> 00:06:00,830
um, you always have to
read the fine print. Yeah.

100
00:06:01,700 --> 00:06:03,900
I hate them because it's,

101
00:06:03,910 --> 00:06:07,880
it's when people ask me
what the IBM cheated. No,

102
00:06:07,881 --> 00:06:12,170
they just bend the rules in their favor.
At states they followed the, the letter,

103
00:06:12,171 --> 00:06:16,530
but of the spirit of the agreement and
for instance, one of the big issues, uh,

104
00:06:16,760 --> 00:06:17,720
after,
uh,

105
00:06:17,870 --> 00:06:21,710
after our first machine for they'll fit
for me it was how can I prepare if I

106
00:06:21,711 --> 00:06:25,460
didn't have any games, this is the normal
way to prepare and look at the game.

107
00:06:25,460 --> 00:06:28,770
So your opponent and the deep blue
in Philadelphia was a black box.

108
00:06:28,970 --> 00:06:31,820
I had no idea what it was capable of.
There were soft,

109
00:06:31,880 --> 00:06:36,020
I saw few games at machine played in,
in other against other computers,

110
00:06:36,260 --> 00:06:37,160
but it was not,

111
00:06:37,490 --> 00:06:41,810
it was not the machine that I faced
me now one year more than one year,

112
00:06:41,811 --> 00:06:45,260
15 months between the first match
and the second match. And, um,

113
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:48,440
and that was under the impression
that it's, it's, it will be,

114
00:06:48,490 --> 00:06:51,950
I will be treated fairly because
after my first victory, Philadelphia,

115
00:06:52,010 --> 00:06:55,160
I went to Yorktown Heights, I said was
their team, they had this, this, you know,

116
00:06:55,161 --> 00:06:57,530
similar arrangements for all
IBM labs around the world.

117
00:06:57,680 --> 00:06:59,480
So the atmosphere was very friendly

118
00:07:01,530 --> 00:07:04,010
and they change and, and
then it just, it's the,

119
00:07:04,040 --> 00:07:08,630
when I eat nodes as I expected them
games to be provided. And then they said,

120
00:07:08,631 --> 00:07:09,111
wait a second,

121
00:07:09,111 --> 00:07:13,940
but can you read the games played in
official tournament's and of course the

122
00:07:13,941 --> 00:07:17,790
blue hasn't played a single game outside
the lab. So which means that in, in,

123
00:07:17,791 --> 00:07:20,420
in Maine 98, in May, 1997,

124
00:07:20,421 --> 00:07:24,310
I face them face another black box that
I knew was much stronger than it's,

125
00:07:24,330 --> 00:07:28,450
it's um, um, it, it was
before but still no idea what,

126
00:07:28,670 --> 00:07:31,070
what to expect. I knew they had
a professional team, so they,

127
00:07:31,250 --> 00:07:32,420
they made a massive preparation.

128
00:07:32,421 --> 00:07:36,230
And I have to also admit my probation
was quite lousy because again,

129
00:07:36,270 --> 00:07:40,370
I only just before the match and we did
before the match and realized, you know,

130
00:07:40,371 --> 00:07:45,350
that's how difficult the challenge
could be. But also the, one of the,

131
00:07:45,351 --> 00:07:49,050
one of the key elements
of the, of, of, of, um,

132
00:07:49,130 --> 00:07:53,890
of this contract that I told
the overlooked was about,
um, machines rebooting. Hmm.

133
00:07:54,170 --> 00:07:56,840
That's a big issue. Yeah. You
understand what it is. It's here.

134
00:07:56,841 --> 00:07:57,770
I don't have to explain,

135
00:07:57,771 --> 00:08:00,020
but general audience doesn't understand
that the moment you work with the

136
00:08:00,021 --> 00:08:02,090
computer, you will never be
able to reconstruct the game.

137
00:08:02,450 --> 00:08:06,560
So which means that is a whole idea that
it's the Ma Mat matches fair and square

138
00:08:06,561 --> 00:08:07,200
and,
and,

139
00:08:07,200 --> 00:08:11,120
and you can always go back and to see
why the blue made this move or that move.

140
00:08:11,430 --> 00:08:14,360
It's all over.
And also they're making,

141
00:08:14,361 --> 00:08:16,700
maybe people don't realize that actually
I didn't meet, as I said, read the book.

142
00:08:16,701 --> 00:08:21,200
They're in fact several
times there they're rebooting
crashed and then we don't

143
00:08:21,201 --> 00:08:24,340
know. And then they came up
with a different move, right.
In a couple of seconds.

144
00:08:24,860 --> 00:08:28,680
It's not, it doesn't matter what the move
was, is just the crash. You know, it's in,

145
00:08:29,030 --> 00:08:33,560
if you played a match, anything but
the, but the problems was agreed. Crush.

146
00:08:33,590 --> 00:08:35,960
You lost the game. Heart
attack. Sorry, go to synagogue.

147
00:08:39,910 --> 00:08:44,000
Yeah, no, but it's the,
it had Ken Thompson. Oh,

148
00:08:44,020 --> 00:08:46,340
that's the great condemned
or expert. Just, you know,

149
00:08:46,341 --> 00:08:48,470
just who was there in
Philadelphia helping me.

150
00:08:48,471 --> 00:08:49,670
He was also in front of the screen,

151
00:08:49,850 --> 00:08:53,480
but on the screen you could see the
deep blues communication back to the

152
00:08:53,481 --> 00:08:58,320
programmer, but you didn't see what have
they said anything. By the way, the,

153
00:08:58,540 --> 00:09:00,870
the other way, again,
I don't know, but it's,

154
00:09:00,871 --> 00:09:04,020
it's definitely created a lot
of tension in the match and, uh,

155
00:09:04,340 --> 00:09:05,960
and we now have to losing game,
uh,

156
00:09:06,020 --> 00:09:08,340
game to its essence and
how the story of its own.

157
00:09:08,500 --> 00:09:12,840
So I was very upset and I demanded a logs.
And by the way,

158
00:09:12,870 --> 00:09:16,620
if they wanted to play
a fair, um, a fair game,

159
00:09:16,890 --> 00:09:19,710
all the head to do is a produced the blog,
the blogs.

160
00:09:19,711 --> 00:09:23,460
And to prove that my suspicions were
not well founded, they didn't do it.

161
00:09:23,820 --> 00:09:25,740
They just wanted me just to, to, uh,

162
00:09:25,741 --> 00:09:29,790
to be inflamed because they realize that
while the blue was not that strong at

163
00:09:29,791 --> 00:09:34,050
that time, I still think I was stronger
objective. And now 20 years later,

164
00:09:34,051 --> 00:09:36,270
you can look at the games.
You know, you can take, uh,

165
00:09:36,340 --> 00:09:39,750
a chess engine on your laptop and you'll
find out that many mistakes were made

166
00:09:39,751 --> 00:09:42,600
from both sides. I mean one of
the, one of the most amazing,

167
00:09:42,660 --> 00:09:46,410
it was not get given game too, but game
five, the end game reach an end game.

168
00:09:46,411 --> 00:09:49,660
I was slightly better.
And everybody at that time in 1997,

169
00:09:49,661 --> 00:09:51,930
I believe that was a
brilliant escape by the blue.

170
00:09:52,140 --> 00:09:56,160
Now in 30 seconds to one minute depends
on the strengths of your, uh, of, of the,

171
00:09:56,161 --> 00:10:00,000
the speed of your computer
chess engines like stock,

172
00:10:00,001 --> 00:10:03,510
fish or comma will tell you
that the end game was a draw.

173
00:10:03,540 --> 00:10:06,300
The blue made a bad mistake. And
I, and then I missed the win,

174
00:10:06,570 --> 00:10:09,690
which nobody saw in 1997.
It's an including including the blue.

175
00:10:09,960 --> 00:10:13,320
So that tells you that stay there, all
of the strings. And I think that's,

176
00:10:13,321 --> 00:10:15,660
if we played it,
this should match the rubber match.

177
00:10:15,690 --> 00:10:18,940
I still had a good chance of winning.
Again, it wouldn't change the sort,

178
00:10:18,941 --> 00:10:20,340
the long term outcome,

179
00:10:20,341 --> 00:10:23,910
but at very thing you could have held
them off for if I hit a full potential

180
00:10:23,940 --> 00:10:26,610
maybe two, three years. As
far as the Blue Maxim to yeah,

181
00:10:26,850 --> 00:10:31,320
I played two more matches with, uh, with,
uh, uh, deep roots and, and, and, and, um,

182
00:10:31,470 --> 00:10:34,230
the junior in 2003 boats ended in a draw.

183
00:10:34,350 --> 00:10:37,620
So that was a balance in the
next five years. But in 1997,

184
00:10:37,621 --> 00:10:41,640
they realized that it putting pressure
on only one human player in a match,

185
00:10:42,210 --> 00:10:43,650
they could,
they could achieve the result.

186
00:10:43,651 --> 00:10:47,850
If you cannot make your play a stronger,
you can definitely, you know, um, uh, um,

187
00:10:48,030 --> 00:10:51,270
in Mclean, the other player and, and,
and, and took him off the ballot.

188
00:10:51,550 --> 00:10:54,710
So, so what I'm saying sort of moving
more to the present day now and you know,

189
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:58,880
how'd you, do you think, how have
chess computers change chest?

190
00:10:58,881 --> 00:11:02,150
Do you think it's for the better?
It's just different. What, what,

191
00:11:02,151 --> 00:11:03,980
what do you think about that,
that evolution,

192
00:11:04,820 --> 00:11:06,810
this something that you said
that you know, it just, it's,

193
00:11:06,811 --> 00:11:10,900
it's quite striking because you said,
is it for better or worse it's happening.

194
00:11:11,010 --> 00:11:15,300
Yeah. Period is, as the technology is not
neither good nor bad. It's agnostic. It,

195
00:11:15,310 --> 00:11:18,580
you know, you can do many great things
too. Is with, with your mobile phone,

196
00:11:18,790 --> 00:11:21,550
but you can also create a terrorist
networks. So it's this, it's,

197
00:11:21,750 --> 00:11:26,190
it's happening and we just have to adjust.
And, uh, as for the game of chess, uh,

198
00:11:26,410 --> 00:11:29,290
it's different because young
generational chess players,

199
00:11:29,320 --> 00:11:31,510
they learn very differently from us.

200
00:11:31,780 --> 00:11:36,160
I remember I had books and not so many
books. You can use new books, you can,

201
00:11:36,161 --> 00:11:40,350
you can buy in the Soviet Union. Every
book was cherished. And I had my, um,

202
00:11:40,450 --> 00:11:44,050
my notebooks. So this is, and I,
when I, when I, when I went to,

203
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:46,090
to the top and played
world championship matches,

204
00:11:46,420 --> 00:11:51,420
I had to also note books and just all
my recording my analysis and I treasure

205
00:11:51,671 --> 00:11:54,520
them. I remember just, you
know, had couple of, couple of,

206
00:11:54,730 --> 00:11:59,710
quite a thick notebooks. We was analysis
and they were, you know, just top secret.

207
00:11:59,950 --> 00:12:03,700
And I believed in eight,
1985 in 1986, 1987.

208
00:12:03,940 --> 00:12:06,640
That was real pressure. That was a
powerful weapon. It's like, you know,

209
00:12:06,641 --> 00:12:10,690
the Magic Sword of Maryland. Now when
you look at this analysis was computer.

210
00:12:10,691 --> 00:12:13,650
You understand what's broken knife.
Um,

211
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:19,340
but also when you look at, at
young young chess players and, um,

212
00:12:19,450 --> 00:12:21,490
under the umbrella of
crossbar off just foundation,

213
00:12:21,790 --> 00:12:25,360
I've been involved in working with
them and I'm talking about Kate's off

214
00:12:25,900 --> 00:12:29,800
international masters, grand
master level. Um, it's,

215
00:12:30,040 --> 00:12:33,040
it's such a different in the
way they approach the game,

216
00:12:33,070 --> 00:12:37,750
the way they look at the pieces. It's,
it's, it happened time and again,

217
00:12:38,040 --> 00:12:42,820
we are reaching certain position,
analyzing the game and they say,

218
00:12:43,300 --> 00:12:47,470
bad move. I made a mistake
here. It's a fine why? Oh,

219
00:12:47,860 --> 00:12:51,970
and then it's a long line. So the
machine showed, I said, I understand,

220
00:12:52,210 --> 00:12:55,420
I could see the screen,
but why you think this move was wrong?

221
00:12:56,320 --> 00:13:00,490
And they don't understand the question
because machine said so because it's on

222
00:13:00,491 --> 00:13:01,720
the screen.
So it's,

223
00:13:01,870 --> 00:13:05,800
it's somehow they are be
the minds being hijacked by,

224
00:13:05,801 --> 00:13:06,970
by the power of the machine.

225
00:13:07,210 --> 00:13:11,110
And one of the reasons Magnus Carlsen
was so successful and still a dominant

226
00:13:11,111 --> 00:13:12,730
force in a wall of chess.

227
00:13:13,210 --> 00:13:17,890
And I remember soon after working with
him in 2009, 2010 for more than a year,

228
00:13:18,150 --> 00:13:18,983
um,

229
00:13:19,180 --> 00:13:23,750
he never looked at the machine as an
ultimate source of wisdom for a much more,

230
00:13:23,800 --> 00:13:26,320
was more like a calculator to,

231
00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:30,670
to verify his own understanding
and evaluation of the position.

232
00:13:31,060 --> 00:13:35,230
This is a big challenge, but
I believe it's not only in
chess, it's elsewhere, uh,

233
00:13:35,290 --> 00:13:39,490
many people just staring at the
computers as ice or just being, you know,

234
00:13:39,491 --> 00:13:43,770
being caught by, by the screen, expecting
just to find the solution. They're just,

235
00:13:43,771 --> 00:13:47,260
you know, instead of thinking
for themselves. So that's
why I always bring Kiddo,

236
00:13:47,261 --> 00:13:49,240
as, as, as an, as a piece of wisdom,

237
00:13:49,310 --> 00:13:53,110
the classical phrase from public ucast
so the computers are useless because they

238
00:13:53,111 --> 00:13:56,950
can only give you answers. Yeah. So,
but everything begins with a question

239
00:13:57,760 --> 00:14:00,510
[inaudible] essentially until about
Magnus Carlsen you say that he,

240
00:14:00,530 --> 00:14:03,010
interestingly, although he's grown
up in the computer chess area,

241
00:14:03,011 --> 00:14:06,430
he's one of the most human, I think you
called it, or intuitive players around.

242
00:14:06,431 --> 00:14:09,250
Right. So it's kind of
interesting. He's consistent.

243
00:14:09,430 --> 00:14:13,870
Um, it's, um, it, yes, it's human
because at the end of the day,

244
00:14:16,300 --> 00:14:18,190
20 years after my match was the blue,

245
00:14:18,310 --> 00:14:22,150
more people playing chess than ever
before and the chest is still very popular

246
00:14:22,151 --> 00:14:23,920
because at the end of the day it's,
it's a,

247
00:14:23,921 --> 00:14:27,100
it's a fight between two
individuals and, uh, um,

248
00:14:27,490 --> 00:14:31,420
what has changed is not a,
it's not just the game itself,

249
00:14:31,421 --> 00:14:35,770
but the way people are watching it.
20 years ago or 30 years ago,

250
00:14:35,771 --> 00:14:36,604
40 years ago,

251
00:14:36,850 --> 00:14:40,180
the world championship match was kind
of in out in the streets in event of

252
00:14:40,181 --> 00:14:41,110
absolute quality.

253
00:14:41,111 --> 00:14:45,040
Even Karpov and Kasparov play the
game and one made a terrible blunder.

254
00:14:45,220 --> 00:14:49,240
It could take time in the press center
for Grand Masters to find out to, to,

255
00:14:49,270 --> 00:14:53,600
to whisper it mistake. And uh, it's,
it's, it's like, you know, this is,

256
00:14:53,700 --> 00:14:57,170
it's something that you could use
warship today. You know, I, I,

257
00:14:57,171 --> 00:14:59,090
when I'm watching what
I'm watching the games,

258
00:14:59,091 --> 00:15:04,091
but Magnus Carlsen Corona and you have
thousands of amateurs from all over the

259
00:15:05,001 --> 00:15:08,120
world watching it, you can, this
scribbling an staying was techniques,

260
00:15:08,270 --> 00:15:10,400
machine shows immediately
that says evaluation drop.

261
00:15:10,610 --> 00:15:14,200
So it's some kind of respect
has disappeared from,

262
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:17,610
from that sense it's a real
shame but also, but also it,

263
00:15:17,640 --> 00:15:21,940
it added interest because people can
follow. They just, you a this days they,

264
00:15:22,020 --> 00:15:24,740
they give access to their
computer and they don't have to,

265
00:15:24,890 --> 00:15:28,280
they don't have to be strong players to
understand what is, what is happening.

266
00:15:28,640 --> 00:15:29,670
And uh,
um,

267
00:15:30,500 --> 00:15:33,260
what an interesting thing you said
actually about the chess computers.

268
00:15:33,261 --> 00:15:36,440
And I wonder if it's going to happen with
Kara as well in the countries that are

269
00:15:36,441 --> 00:15:41,090
not traditionally did at
chess or go because they have
access to these machines.

270
00:15:41,210 --> 00:15:43,940
Maybe kids in those countries
can now get very strong, right?

271
00:15:43,970 --> 00:15:46,430
Like magnus in no way or I don't
know whether that's, you know,

272
00:15:46,930 --> 00:15:50,710
madness. It's a, it's a rise.

273
00:15:50,711 --> 00:15:55,010
Meteoric rise was due to computers and
maybe it's because you are you in, in, in,

274
00:15:55,011 --> 00:15:56,770
in, in, uh, in this environment.

275
00:15:56,771 --> 00:16:01,180
You don't have to spend so much time
learning from other players. So, um, the,

276
00:16:01,210 --> 00:16:05,050
the process of, of, of maturing for
the chess player is much shorter.

277
00:16:05,320 --> 00:16:09,360
You have a grand masters at 14,
15 today. They know much water.

278
00:16:09,361 --> 00:16:13,000
Bob Official knew 40 years ago. Uh,
just because they played many games,

279
00:16:13,001 --> 00:16:15,760
they could travel around and they
could watch the games. So chess,

280
00:16:16,690 --> 00:16:19,710
chess is a perfect match for four
Internet because you can follow the games,

281
00:16:19,740 --> 00:16:21,100
you can learn,
you can analyze.

282
00:16:21,280 --> 00:16:26,200
So the many things you can do that at
a dramatically increased the pace of,

283
00:16:26,201 --> 00:16:28,480
of,
of learning and getting to the top.

284
00:16:29,190 --> 00:16:32,130
So you, you invented I think the
concept of advanced chess, right?

285
00:16:32,131 --> 00:16:35,580
Matt Mann and computer,
human and computer issue and cares,

286
00:16:35,590 --> 00:16:39,540
human and computer versus computer.
Are you still stronger?

287
00:16:39,730 --> 00:16:42,810
Have you tried that recently with
the later chess engines? Are you,

288
00:16:42,811 --> 00:16:43,740
is that still true now?

289
00:16:43,840 --> 00:16:47,650
Oh, um, yes. Um, yeah. Why licking
my wounds after the blue match.

290
00:16:47,651 --> 00:16:52,360
So I sorta how about bring you
together just out of curiosity,

291
00:16:52,570 --> 00:16:53,770
because as a way to segregate,

292
00:16:53,771 --> 00:16:57,250
if I just can play with who is a
machine just against another player.

293
00:16:57,251 --> 00:16:59,560
So maybe we can play perfect chest.
Now,

294
00:16:59,561 --> 00:17:03,280
the interesting thing is when we played
these match was Veselin Topalov in other,

295
00:17:03,340 --> 00:17:05,980
in other top player. Uh, in 99, he ate,

296
00:17:06,340 --> 00:17:10,480
I can tell you the quality was not very
high because it was limited amount of

297
00:17:10,481 --> 00:17:15,310
time and it was so new for us
how to use the machine. It's end.

298
00:17:15,340 --> 00:17:18,130
Eventually I realized
and we had many events,

299
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:22,660
the so called freestyle events on the
Internet that proved that it sounds quite

300
00:17:22,661 --> 00:17:23,261
ironic,

301
00:17:23,261 --> 00:17:28,261
but you don't need a very strong player
to get the best result of human plus

302
00:17:28,571 --> 00:17:32,800
machine combination. It could sound
like a Harris in now, but it's,

303
00:17:33,040 --> 00:17:37,900
I would say that you don't, you
don't want a strong player. It's,

304
00:17:37,901 --> 00:17:39,610
you need a good operator
and decent player.

305
00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:42,610
But someone who will follow the machine,

306
00:17:42,611 --> 00:17:46,750
I should guide the machine but not will
you use the machine to back up his or

307
00:17:46,751 --> 00:17:51,751
her own ideas because instinctively
if I came up was a computer,

308
00:17:52,380 --> 00:17:55,980
I'll try to sue. I'll try to make my
own moves. Yeah, you don't have to.

309
00:17:56,160 --> 00:18:00,210
All you need is just to maximize the
effect of machines play because machines

310
00:18:00,211 --> 00:18:04,830
are so strong now. All we need, all your
you have to do is just to, to guide them.

311
00:18:04,831 --> 00:18:08,700
Sometimes you can feel no, just, you know,
slight correction, move here, move there.

312
00:18:08,701 --> 00:18:10,410
So it's,
it's,

313
00:18:10,440 --> 00:18:14,880
it's something that requires a
very different kind of qualities.

314
00:18:14,910 --> 00:18:19,230
It's more about interface. So you don't
need a great knowledge of the game,

315
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:22,680
my weight, it may help,
but it's to the other side.

316
00:18:22,890 --> 00:18:27,890
It may preclude you from a sort of using
machines power because you try to play

317
00:18:28,141 --> 00:18:29,880
your own game,
which could be detrimental.

318
00:18:30,410 --> 00:18:32,900
So it's, it's something
that's, um, you know,

319
00:18:32,901 --> 00:18:36,200
I think you touched on in a few places
that it's become known as Casper off law.

320
00:18:36,201 --> 00:18:38,380
Now write something like this
with the processes, right?

321
00:18:38,730 --> 00:18:41,390
Oh, do you, and explain what that
is and again, and again, I just, I,

322
00:18:41,391 --> 00:18:42,990
I relied on results of the,

323
00:18:42,991 --> 00:18:47,830
of the freestyle tournaments and what's
happened is there that as predicted, uh,

324
00:18:48,170 --> 00:18:50,740
uh, a human plus machine, uh,

325
00:18:50,860 --> 00:18:54,300
beat super computer quite handily.
Uh,

326
00:18:54,330 --> 00:18:59,250
but the most unexpected story was
that it starts as a described, um,

327
00:18:59,490 --> 00:19:03,960
a relatively weak human or a group
of humans plus machine or machines.

328
00:19:04,020 --> 00:19:06,690
If the class plus better a better process,

329
00:19:07,120 --> 00:19:10,620
they of course they beat a supercomputer,
would know more. Remarkably,

330
00:19:10,800 --> 00:19:13,980
they beat a strong human plus
machine plus in fury process.

331
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:17,070
So that's led me to come to the
conclusion that it's all about interface.

332
00:19:17,570 --> 00:19:21,510
This is so many, um, ways of, of, of um,

333
00:19:21,570 --> 00:19:24,540
empowering machines was our creativity.

334
00:19:24,990 --> 00:19:28,170
So not our creativity was machines
brute force of calculation.

335
00:19:28,171 --> 00:19:31,380
Actually you do it other way around
and then the result is, is it could,

336
00:19:31,381 --> 00:19:32,230
it could be phenomenal.
Mm.

337
00:19:32,610 --> 00:19:34,110
So it strikes me in the whole book,

338
00:19:34,111 --> 00:19:36,610
you're very optimistic about
technology in general, Ricky.

339
00:19:36,620 --> 00:19:39,080
Now in terms of like what it
might be able to do, what,

340
00:19:39,100 --> 00:19:42,690
what is this a kind of process? Is
that a kind of blueprint for, you know,

341
00:19:42,691 --> 00:19:46,770
in advanced chess of how you see things
going forward in other areas of life

342
00:19:46,800 --> 00:19:50,840
with machines and humans working
together in a complementary way? Oh, uh,

343
00:19:51,450 --> 00:19:55,240
I believe, uh, the future is a
self fulfilling prophecy and um,

344
00:19:55,650 --> 00:20:00,230
I cannot stand all these, uh, you know,
doom and gloom predictions. Um, it's,

345
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:04,950
it was quite amazing when you just look
at ad the ad change of the trend in

346
00:20:04,951 --> 00:20:07,530
science fiction from 50s and 60s,

347
00:20:07,531 --> 00:20:12,300
where is all about optimism?
US [inaudible] was computers,

348
00:20:12,320 --> 00:20:15,900
Robert's cyborgs flying to do other,

349
00:20:15,930 --> 00:20:19,620
not just to other planners
but to other star systems.

350
00:20:20,160 --> 00:20:20,970
And then it's,

351
00:20:20,970 --> 00:20:25,970
it changed to a very dystopian
vision of the terminator.

352
00:20:27,241 --> 00:20:31,470
Uh, and the, um, uh,
the metrics, by the way,

353
00:20:31,471 --> 00:20:35,550
there's a speaking about the
terminator, you know, I just,
it's, I, I just recently,

354
00:20:35,551 --> 00:20:39,300
I just got an idea, just having a lecture
in, in, in Dallas, Texas, earliest spawns.

355
00:20:39,870 --> 00:20:42,390
I looked at the terminator,
I said, you know what guys?

356
00:20:42,870 --> 00:20:46,290
I can tell you that that's another
proof of what you call [inaudible] law

357
00:20:46,500 --> 00:20:50,770
because we're all watched the first one,
human versus machine.

358
00:20:51,040 --> 00:20:55,780
But if you follow the number two or number
three, that was exactly what I said.

359
00:20:57,230 --> 00:21:01,480
Human plus machine was a better
process of it being a super computer.

360
00:21:03,370 --> 00:21:07,120
So it's the, yeah, and, and
I think it's this, it's this,

361
00:21:07,121 --> 00:21:09,910
what we'll learn from chess is
that there are many ways of us,

362
00:21:10,060 --> 00:21:13,120
of us sort of getting,
getting some, something new,

363
00:21:13,121 --> 00:21:15,640
something positive out of those
corporation. And by the way,

364
00:21:15,880 --> 00:21:18,400
these things are going to happen anyway.
So let's see.

365
00:21:18,550 --> 00:21:20,560
What's the point of trying to slow down,

366
00:21:20,561 --> 00:21:25,561
which is a natural cycle that we have a
technology replacing certain elements of

367
00:21:26,861 --> 00:21:28,490
human activities.
Uh,

368
00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:33,460
for centuries technology
was their machines have been
replacing blue collar jobs.

369
00:21:33,820 --> 00:21:37,540
Now the difference is now machines are
threatening people with college degrees,

370
00:21:37,541 --> 00:21:41,190
political influence and Twitter
accounts. That's, that's why we, we,

371
00:21:41,350 --> 00:21:44,140
we hear all the stories about it,
but that's, that's absolutely normal.

372
00:21:44,350 --> 00:21:48,010
I think that's, that's, that's
called progress. And, uh, um, it's,

373
00:21:48,011 --> 00:21:52,830
if machines taking over certain nil,
certain menial parts of, of, uh, um,

374
00:21:52,900 --> 00:21:57,760
elements or aspects of, of condition,
that's, that's not the end of the world.

375
00:21:57,790 --> 00:22:00,250
It's, there's still many
things that humans can do.

376
00:22:00,370 --> 00:22:04,600
All we need is just to look for new
challenges and for a new frontiers.

377
00:22:05,320 --> 00:22:09,130
So we just come back from China
for the Alphago match against Kj.

378
00:22:09,400 --> 00:22:12,550
And one thing that happens in go, which
is slightly different from is and go,

379
00:22:12,551 --> 00:22:17,400
there's a tradition of players thinking
about how far off from optimal play are

380
00:22:17,410 --> 00:22:21,550
they are in theoretical God play or
optimal play. So how far are you into,

381
00:22:21,551 --> 00:22:25,060
do you think even in the top chess
computers are from optimal chess? I mean,

382
00:22:25,061 --> 00:22:29,020
what do you think that the top e low
rating it would be possible to play chess

383
00:22:29,021 --> 00:22:30,880
at is?
Do you have an idea?

384
00:22:31,340 --> 00:22:34,400
No, I don't know why the idea because
I just, we briefly discussed, you know,

385
00:22:34,520 --> 00:22:39,010
lunches that um, when you look
at the, uh, at the, um, uh,

386
00:22:39,210 --> 00:22:42,830
date end give databases and
now we have all seven pieces.

387
00:22:42,860 --> 00:22:46,430
That's a hundred terabytes
or whatever. Uh, and uh,

388
00:22:46,490 --> 00:22:49,820
so every position is being
calculated from now to the very end.

389
00:22:50,150 --> 00:22:53,480
And in many cases you just, you
know, we have a position that says,

390
00:22:53,660 --> 00:22:55,640
made in 492 moves.

391
00:22:57,080 --> 00:23:00,770
And I bet you that in the first 450
moves you will not see the difference.

392
00:23:01,310 --> 00:23:04,590
So I could see probably fallen
20 moves. Yes. But it's just, um,

393
00:23:05,120 --> 00:23:08,960
now I don't know what it tells about the
gay we play because the average human

394
00:23:08,961 --> 00:23:13,220
games 50 moves. Now when you look at
average machine games, it's maybe 80,

395
00:23:13,221 --> 00:23:18,110
90 moves. It doesn't mean that again
should be too long or what we know that,

396
00:23:18,420 --> 00:23:21,560
you know, the game of chess is an
ultimate end game was suited to pieces.

397
00:23:21,560 --> 00:23:26,560
So that's why I don't see any chance in
any future that machine will play e two

398
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:31,700
e four and we'll announce,
made in six, 2,755 booths.

399
00:23:32,270 --> 00:23:33,200
It's not going to happen.

400
00:23:33,201 --> 00:23:37,570
The number of legal moves in the game
of chess 10 power 45, that's enough to,

401
00:23:37,750 --> 00:23:42,260
to feel safe. Um, but it's
not about solving the game.
It's about winning the game.

402
00:23:42,320 --> 00:23:44,390
And, um, and I think there's still in, oh,

403
00:23:44,391 --> 00:23:47,600
some improvement and machines could
get better and better as this, as the,

404
00:23:47,810 --> 00:23:49,400
I mean is basically sky's the limit.

405
00:23:49,550 --> 00:23:54,410
And today I still think magnus
was white in his good day.

406
00:23:54,411 --> 00:23:56,900
We'll probably secure a
draw against the machine.

407
00:23:57,260 --> 00:24:01,650
But winning against a computer today,
it's virtually impossible, is the, the,

408
00:24:01,750 --> 00:24:06,380
the level of precision that required,
that is required, the level of vigilance,

409
00:24:06,650 --> 00:24:09,950
it's just, it's impossible.
So it's a win win.

410
00:24:09,951 --> 00:24:13,490
What would you use to Duke to play
with such attention? Um, so, uh,

411
00:24:13,491 --> 00:24:16,260
machines we'll get, we'll,
we'll, we'll, we'll get better.
And by the way we see it,

412
00:24:16,280 --> 00:24:20,930
we see an improvement all the time. I
remember this as well by writing my books,

413
00:24:20,931 --> 00:24:25,050
my great predecessors, and then my
mattress against Karpov and then my own,

414
00:24:25,080 --> 00:24:28,520
my best games and some of the
Games or seven games analyze two,

415
00:24:28,521 --> 00:24:32,540
three years later, which is this new
version of the same engine and engine.

416
00:24:33,050 --> 00:24:37,220
And just, I could see that, you know,
there's this, some of the, some of the,

417
00:24:37,400 --> 00:24:41,650
some of the moves that are treated
as, as, as, as, as great. Uh, uh,

418
00:24:41,690 --> 00:24:46,400
in say 2009 in 2012 was
Pablo Paulville computer.

419
00:24:46,550 --> 00:24:50,120
I had my doubts. Yeah. Very cool. So
look, I've got so many more questions,

420
00:24:50,121 --> 00:24:53,450
but I know I should, I should give some
time. A time. Is A, is moving forward.

421
00:24:53,451 --> 00:24:54,141
So I don't know.

422
00:24:54,141 --> 00:24:58,100
I should let the audience
ask any questions if you
put your hand up her high so

423
00:24:58,101 --> 00:24:58,934
I can see,

424
00:25:00,020 --> 00:25:00,853
wow.
Oh,

425
00:25:01,040 --> 00:25:05,690
we'll silos. We covered everything.
Okay. Well let me ask another quick,

426
00:25:05,720 --> 00:25:06,820
oh wait a second was the question again?

427
00:25:06,860 --> 00:25:11,530
Yeah, yeah, Yup. Okay. Okay.

428
00:25:11,690 --> 00:25:15,780
So now I went to that school.
I was too young when the,

429
00:25:15,810 --> 00:25:18,050
the match happen.
So I don't have any personal memories.

430
00:25:18,510 --> 00:25:19,343
Yes.

431
00:25:22,070 --> 00:25:26,780
Um, but when they read stories of
it, it kind of struck me that, uh,

432
00:25:26,781 --> 00:25:30,770
the match seemed like
everyone was great publicity,

433
00:25:30,771 --> 00:25:35,270
but people really wanted to see whether,
well to put the bond,

434
00:25:35,330 --> 00:25:40,150
whether you would is against the
machine. And I found this really, um,

435
00:25:40,370 --> 00:25:41,510
my question is basically,

436
00:25:41,660 --> 00:25:45,320
do you feel like this was the case or do
you feel it actually felt like a normal,

437
00:25:45,800 --> 00:25:48,560
just match where people would
see who would win? Or rather,

438
00:25:48,590 --> 00:25:51,410
did you feel like you've had
support from your side as well?

439
00:25:51,800 --> 00:25:55,890
Oh yeah. I pledge of support. I can
tell you that, uh, most, uh, uh,

440
00:25:55,900 --> 00:25:59,450
of people who wanted me to lose the grant,
the wall of chess now,

441
00:25:59,451 --> 00:26:02,990
because I was Awol Chapman for 12 years,
and that was the first one I will last.

442
00:26:03,680 --> 00:26:04,670
So that's naturally,

443
00:26:04,671 --> 00:26:08,970
a lot of people wanted me to lose one
day and since I was unbeatable in the

444
00:26:08,990 --> 00:26:13,290
human chess, so they, they had that,
they had a hopes in the machine,

445
00:26:16,320 --> 00:26:20,840
but I had was fear that
was phenomenal. And, uh,

446
00:26:21,020 --> 00:26:23,420
it's, uh, the, it's a, it
was a reflection of the,

447
00:26:23,480 --> 00:26:28,340
of the famous cover of the Newsweek,
the brain's last stand. And, uh,

448
00:26:28,341 --> 00:26:32,580
I remember when I want get one of the
match was a big celebration. I get,

449
00:26:32,581 --> 00:26:37,550
it was on CNN. They, they
talked to you. Did you do the,
uh, uh, the two presenters,

450
00:26:37,551 --> 00:26:40,560
they, they, they talked about
it and said, look, it's, it's,

451
00:26:40,561 --> 00:26:43,590
it's a Russian playing in American
machine, but I'm rooting for Russian

452
00:26:47,750 --> 00:26:48,583
and the questions.

453
00:26:50,640 --> 00:26:52,450
All
right,

454
00:26:54,760 --> 00:26:57,410
Dora, great from the Alphago team. Um,

455
00:26:58,640 --> 00:27:03,640
humans seem to be more
efficient in playing chess
and go probably and that they

456
00:27:04,731 --> 00:27:09,590
evaluate much fewer variations and
physicians than, than computers do.

457
00:27:09,950 --> 00:27:12,900
I mean by many orders of
magnitude probably can,

458
00:27:12,950 --> 00:27:17,400
can you give us an integration of, of, of
how this difference can come about what,

459
00:27:17,401 --> 00:27:22,090
what are humans actually so
good at in chess that they can,

460
00:27:22,160 --> 00:27:26,140
can do this so efficiently and that
they only need to examine so few, uh,

461
00:27:26,350 --> 00:27:28,370
variations as compared to computers?

462
00:27:29,960 --> 00:27:30,793
MMM,

463
00:27:30,930 --> 00:27:33,490
no,
we can talk about sort of general rules,

464
00:27:33,820 --> 00:27:37,780
but also you should remember that there
are different playing styles because the

465
00:27:37,781 --> 00:27:42,610
way a carpet or myself, we'll look at the
same positions, you'd be very different.

466
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:43,391
It goes,

467
00:27:43,391 --> 00:27:48,391
I will maybe look for an opportunity to
break through just to sharpen the game

468
00:27:49,120 --> 00:27:53,380
cheek, create complications and Carpo
we'll bill looking for sort of long term

469
00:27:53,381 --> 00:27:57,480
strategic advantage that could
manifest in the end game. It's um, uh,

470
00:27:58,150 --> 00:28:02,110
those are the differences. Uh, what brings
us together is that as you just said,

471
00:28:02,220 --> 00:28:07,060
Eh, we didn't have to
analyze millions of lines.

472
00:28:07,090 --> 00:28:11,110
We couldn't,
so we could look for one or two options.

473
00:28:11,710 --> 00:28:15,880
How do we know that those two
options are the best? I don't know.

474
00:28:16,390 --> 00:28:20,980
I just said simply, I know this what it
is. Uh, but again, uh, it's the, it's,

475
00:28:21,010 --> 00:28:24,850
it's the, then we, we had a
lot of subtle difference. Um,

476
00:28:25,420 --> 00:28:29,340
I will probably try to go as deep
as I can calculating carp of,

477
00:28:29,660 --> 00:28:32,470
we'll try to look for an option where
he doesn't have to calculate at all.

478
00:28:32,471 --> 00:28:34,630
So we're relying on these
understanding because I,

479
00:28:34,631 --> 00:28:38,110
many patterns you can recognize patterns
and then bringing in patterns together.

480
00:28:38,111 --> 00:28:40,840
You can have a picture,
big picture. Um, that's,

481
00:28:40,841 --> 00:28:44,560
that's what humans are a unique hat.
And, uh, that's, that's why for instance,

482
00:28:44,590 --> 00:28:47,830
if you are, if you came up
with a computer, sometimes,

483
00:28:47,831 --> 00:28:51,670
if it was all is that's, I
wouldn't go there. It's a,

484
00:28:52,240 --> 00:28:55,390
and then it's quite interesting to like
to check whether machines calculation

485
00:28:55,391 --> 00:29:00,280
proves it. Uh, but in many cases I
think it will be right. And, uh, and uh,

486
00:29:00,281 --> 00:29:05,080
and the special at the time when
machine goes very deep, uh, and then,

487
00:29:05,320 --> 00:29:09,830
which is it's horizon. And then you also
should look at the position and say,

488
00:29:10,100 --> 00:29:14,260
mmm, it smells, it's, there's something
wrong. I don't know exactly what is wrong,

489
00:29:14,261 --> 00:29:16,910
but something, something is wrong. Um,

490
00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:21,310
there are also situations where you
have to calculate when you sacrifice

491
00:29:21,311 --> 00:29:25,450
something, you sacrificed material and
it's, it's, it's a take it or break it.

492
00:29:25,451 --> 00:29:28,810
So you cannot afford to be, uh, to, to,

493
00:29:28,811 --> 00:29:32,350
to use your common sense because
you are material down. Um,

494
00:29:32,351 --> 00:29:35,950
so my gay was Veselin Topalov
another one I played in 1999.

495
00:29:36,100 --> 00:29:38,590
That's my longest combination.
So I,

496
00:29:39,490 --> 00:29:44,050
I cannot tell you that I saw whole every
line there. It will, we'll be drew.

497
00:29:44,051 --> 00:29:47,530
But Dee Dee, the combination,
the final position that I saw,

498
00:29:47,531 --> 00:29:50,170
it's like an old lightened ink.
Just very quickly,

499
00:29:50,171 --> 00:29:54,590
what will happen at the end
included, uh, the, uh, the, um,

500
00:29:55,170 --> 00:29:59,860
uh, it's shitty. Apply links,
15 foot moves. So let's, uh,

501
00:30:00,250 --> 00:30:04,800
um, ironically that because I saw
this, the final position as late,

502
00:30:04,801 --> 00:30:09,350
the machine proved that I could win
earlier, uh, couple of miss the chance to,

503
00:30:09,370 --> 00:30:13,960
not to escape, but to have test the end
game that he could probably defend. Um,

504
00:30:13,990 --> 00:30:17,270
but, um, otherwise it's
just, it's, uh, it's, uh,

505
00:30:17,320 --> 00:30:21,850
what you described is just another proof
of the MORAVEC paradox. That's the, uh,

506
00:30:22,060 --> 00:30:23,740
I was going to bring up,
you should explain what that is.

507
00:30:23,741 --> 00:30:24,760
Could you talk about that a lot?

508
00:30:25,530 --> 00:30:29,510
But is that says machines are very good
at what humans are not so good and,

509
00:30:29,511 --> 00:30:33,340
and other around. So it's
a chess. Chess is, it's,

510
00:30:33,341 --> 00:30:38,341
it's interesting that chess was probably
because go and Shogi day we'll just

511
00:30:38,561 --> 00:30:42,310
played elsewhere. But for,
for the western science,

512
00:30:42,340 --> 00:30:46,880
chess was an ultimate test for,
for artificial intelligence. And a,

513
00:30:46,881 --> 00:30:51,670
that was another result of 99, nine, nine,
seven match that the expectations of,

514
00:30:51,700 --> 00:30:55,600
of the founding fathers of computer
science, like Alan Turing, Claude Shannon,

515
00:30:55,601 --> 00:30:59,560
Norbert Wiener,
that machine beating strong chess player.

516
00:30:59,740 --> 00:31:03,820
And of course the world champion would
be it, this is the moment for AI,

517
00:31:04,750 --> 00:31:06,400
I have to say they were wrong.
So it's this,

518
00:31:06,401 --> 00:31:11,090
this people was as intelligent
as your alarm clock. Have

519
00:31:13,150 --> 00:31:17,350
the, a, a theory about the Moravec
paradox is that your explanation for that,

520
00:31:17,351 --> 00:31:21,490
if you have built systems
like deep blue was then, um,

521
00:31:21,550 --> 00:31:22,600
as the programmers,

522
00:31:22,690 --> 00:31:26,530
you have to understand clearly enough
what you're trying to codify explicitly.

523
00:31:26,590 --> 00:31:29,920
So you can codify it in a rules
or heuristics like deep blue ones.

524
00:31:30,370 --> 00:31:33,730
And the problem is, is that for many
things that we take for granted as humans,

525
00:31:33,731 --> 00:31:37,510
like, um, vision or riding a bike,
all these things we do implicitly,

526
00:31:37,690 --> 00:31:41,290
we don't explicitly understand
well enough how we do those things.

527
00:31:41,440 --> 00:31:43,510
So we can't codify it and that,
that,

528
00:31:43,540 --> 00:31:46,840
but that's why I think that learning
systems, the kinds of things like Alphago,

529
00:31:47,050 --> 00:31:50,920
my end up being more powerful because
they could learn how it from experience,

530
00:31:50,921 --> 00:31:52,540
how to do those things like humans do.

531
00:31:52,860 --> 00:31:56,370
No, it's seeds. It's one of the, one of
the rules that are learned, you know,

532
00:31:56,371 --> 00:32:01,371
from my experience is that anything that
we do and we know how we do machines

533
00:32:01,711 --> 00:32:05,220
will do better because we can
communicate it. So it's one word,

534
00:32:05,221 --> 00:32:06,530
knowledge codified.
Uh,

535
00:32:06,720 --> 00:32:10,830
so the big question is now
whether machines can ever do,

536
00:32:11,100 --> 00:32:14,400
she really was things that we
do without knowing how. Yeah.

537
00:32:14,620 --> 00:32:17,110
Yeah. No, exactly. That's the
big question, right. I mean,

538
00:32:17,111 --> 00:32:19,840
I think you say in your
book, um, up til now,

539
00:32:19,900 --> 00:32:23,260
anybody who attempted learning systems
and killing your great teacher bottleneck,

540
00:32:23,560 --> 00:32:25,240
uh,
we're fell short against,

541
00:32:25,500 --> 00:32:30,080
well yeah, the, against the spacey, the
hand code. So 40 years ago, cause it's,

542
00:32:30,081 --> 00:32:34,400
it's in the beginning there was a big
debate and I think that states states, uh,

543
00:32:34,500 --> 00:32:36,480
I've been touring car few people,

544
00:32:36,560 --> 00:32:39,080
nobody wears a cure or the
fourth program in 1950,

545
00:32:39,740 --> 00:32:43,550
there was a chess program and did the
trick was that there was no computer.

546
00:32:45,060 --> 00:32:48,410
This is the only game that the, the
tutoring program. Yes, exactly. And just,

547
00:32:48,411 --> 00:32:52,400
you know, just he put it on a piece of
paper and a calculated the moves and the,

548
00:32:52,640 --> 00:32:54,620
and the,
when I spoke at decent Tennery,

549
00:32:54,621 --> 00:32:57,710
so I asked now friends from Germany to
actually reconstruct it and put it in the

550
00:32:57,711 --> 00:33:01,610
computer. We can actually play
it curing machine, pretty weak,

551
00:33:01,700 --> 00:33:05,510
but it's nine 52. So, but they
believed, and that's interesting.

552
00:33:05,511 --> 00:33:09,050
They believe that uh,
uh, the, the way to, uh,

553
00:33:09,260 --> 00:33:14,000
to make machines playing chess, it's not
brute force, but understanding, but it's,

554
00:33:14,001 --> 00:33:14,730
it failed.

555
00:33:14,730 --> 00:33:18,400
This cost of failed very quickly because
boot force kept coming and studio,

556
00:33:19,190 --> 00:33:22,970
it's all I got was like avalanche. They,
they, they couldn't stand a chance.

557
00:33:23,090 --> 00:33:23,900
So that's why the,

558
00:33:23,900 --> 00:33:27,860
the all the terms including one of my
great teacher may call Buttrick uh,

559
00:33:27,920 --> 00:33:29,270
to come up with this,

560
00:33:29,450 --> 00:33:33,860
with this parallel concept of
learning failed and buddy on the 60s,

561
00:33:33,861 --> 00:33:37,190
early seventies, it was just,
it was, it, the store was over.

562
00:33:37,310 --> 00:33:41,960
Now it seems that we're just like an in
seasons. We going back to two, these two,

563
00:33:41,961 --> 00:33:44,190
these two, this notion, and
maybe it will prove to be

564
00:33:44,640 --> 00:33:48,300
or fee Alphago we'll make above and
a copy. Then, you know, it hurts.

565
00:33:48,301 --> 00:33:51,720
It's sort of a learning system, right?
So it turns out the go go needed to,

566
00:33:51,740 --> 00:33:52,560
needed to happen.

567
00:33:52,560 --> 00:33:56,220
What do you think the
difference is between go and
chest that required going to

568
00:33:56,221 --> 00:33:58,920
have the, you know, have to
have this other approach. You
know, they couldn't do it.

569
00:33:58,921 --> 00:34:00,150
The handcrafted approach.

570
00:34:00,560 --> 00:34:01,670
Um,
you know,

571
00:34:03,440 --> 00:34:05,810
it's a tough question because I have meal,

572
00:34:05,960 --> 00:34:09,470
absolute knowledge of the game of chess
and almost zero knowledge of the game go.

573
00:34:09,670 --> 00:34:12,900
Yeah. Uh, so, um, uh,

574
00:34:13,280 --> 00:34:15,620
but for what I know is that it's the,

575
00:34:15,621 --> 00:34:20,150
God doesn't have the same tactical uh,
um,

576
00:34:20,240 --> 00:34:24,440
configuration. So you, you, you
have to, it's all about strategy.

577
00:34:24,950 --> 00:34:27,190
It's a long term. And uh, and uh,

578
00:34:27,200 --> 00:34:31,010
that's why it's far more difficult
for machines to learn how to do that.

579
00:34:31,130 --> 00:34:34,820
But also if machines could
do at certain level, they,

580
00:34:34,890 --> 00:34:38,130
they could be dead lift for humans
because it's, it's, they, they,

581
00:34:38,131 --> 00:34:41,790
they suddenly become superior.
So my, and I, again, I,

582
00:34:41,791 --> 00:34:46,490
I'm not sure just I'm sticking to great
expert. I still think that relatively,

583
00:34:47,330 --> 00:34:48,800
if you compare the strengths,

584
00:34:49,340 --> 00:34:53,780
I think the chess playing engines
are relatively stronger than Alphago.

585
00:34:54,250 --> 00:34:58,260
Uh, it's in absolute ratings but,
but, but then you look at it,

586
00:34:58,330 --> 00:35:02,780
but then the gap between its just because
the mistakes made by human players in

587
00:35:02,781 --> 00:35:05,630
golf, they are deadly. They
are just the, they, they,

588
00:35:05,780 --> 00:35:09,980
they could take an offer more openings for
the machine. So in chess, the, the, the,

589
00:35:10,040 --> 00:35:13,820
the human game was always unstable. So
he's not as, as a state as the machine,

590
00:35:14,030 --> 00:35:18,170
but I think in, in God, the, the,
the, uh, the depth of, of, of,

591
00:35:18,171 --> 00:35:22,880
of the mistake could, could be, um, could
be far more significant than in chest.

592
00:35:22,980 --> 00:35:26,610
I guess we'll have to put that to the
test by teaching Africa chest to play

593
00:35:26,611 --> 00:35:28,810
chess. Right. And then we'll
have it, we'll say six.

594
00:35:29,940 --> 00:35:34,410
That'll be interesting. And so how soon
Alphago can crush the strongest church.

595
00:35:34,430 --> 00:35:38,220
It just engines, again, it's, it's
than he's thought about Alphago,

596
00:35:38,221 --> 00:35:42,780
but it's about the nature of the game
goal go and chess. But I, you know,

597
00:35:42,781 --> 00:35:45,870
would you be some pretty surprised
if our learning system could beat the

598
00:35:45,871 --> 00:35:48,040
handcraft, the systems,
Erikson chest? Look, there's,

599
00:35:48,090 --> 00:35:51,910
this will be another level of
experiment because the, the, the,

600
00:35:51,911 --> 00:35:56,220
the current systems, they,
it's not primitive brute
force anymore. Now it says,

601
00:35:56,340 --> 00:36:00,270
that's why I said it's this, it's
today. Um, uh, any, um, and by the way,

602
00:36:00,271 --> 00:36:02,280
that's the woman that say people just,

603
00:36:02,281 --> 00:36:06,240
you're looking at me in this belief
from nonprofessional audiences. I said,

604
00:36:06,270 --> 00:36:09,990
free chess app on your mobile
phone are stronger than the
blue. No, no, no, no, no.

605
00:36:09,991 --> 00:36:12,230
He says you are so losery I'm so loser.

606
00:36:15,220 --> 00:36:18,970
It doesn't change it though. This is
the fact that it's that. Absolutely.

607
00:36:19,070 --> 00:36:22,660
Absolutely. It's the now very good.
So I don't know if there's a loss

608
00:36:22,760 --> 00:36:25,220
question from the ordinance. We
have time for one or two more. Yes.

609
00:36:25,250 --> 00:36:26,750
From the lady the fall.

610
00:36:29,040 --> 00:36:29,873
Yes.
At the front here

611
00:36:32,490 --> 00:36:37,150
I see kids. Where do
you play? Oh, well cool.

612
00:36:39,270 --> 00:36:39,660
Okay.

613
00:36:39,660 --> 00:36:41,730
Yeah. This, the, there are
a couple of problems. One,

614
00:36:41,731 --> 00:36:44,610
I'm a retired and I don't play
professional just to deep blues debt.

615
00:36:45,190 --> 00:36:46,023
Yeah.

616
00:36:47,060 --> 00:36:51,770
Yeah. Uh, um, I, I wanted
to blend 90, 98 and I, um,

617
00:36:52,300 --> 00:36:56,990
I, I wish I had a chance, but,
um, that's, that's it. You know,

618
00:36:56,991 --> 00:36:59,630
that's, that's, that's
um, old history. It's, um,

619
00:37:00,290 --> 00:37:04,730
it's a spilled milk water under the
bridge share, you name it. Uh, um,

620
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:08,750
but I, you know, I, I played, uh,
played other computers and, uh,

621
00:37:09,230 --> 00:37:13,520
as long as I was active chess player,
I never dumped a challenge. And, uh,

622
00:37:14,030 --> 00:37:16,210
and that's why, you know, the, the,

623
00:37:16,490 --> 00:37:21,490
this book begins with a story of me
playing sooty to chess computers in 1985.

624
00:37:25,220 --> 00:37:29,730
It's similar than as exhibition.
Uh, I'm not sure what anyone owns.

625
00:37:29,731 --> 00:37:30,564
Still owes,

626
00:37:30,830 --> 00:37:35,510
owes the chest machine that's
from an antique chairs, machines.

627
00:37:36,030 --> 00:37:39,820
Anybody here I still have on the CDC.
This is it.

628
00:37:40,700 --> 00:37:42,080
So I played a play this,

629
00:37:42,081 --> 00:37:45,710
it's silly to machines and
there were four manufacturers,

630
00:37:45,770 --> 00:37:48,320
eight machines each and
I won all the games,

631
00:37:49,280 --> 00:37:51,950
most amazing thing that
nobody was surprised.

632
00:37:52,820 --> 00:37:56,750
And it can tell you the progress.
It's just from that match.

633
00:37:56,751 --> 00:37:59,390
In 1985,
just there played in June,

634
00:37:59,391 --> 00:38:03,800
just a few months before I won
the title beating Corp of, uh,

635
00:38:04,100 --> 00:38:06,200
to my management's Dbu.
Just 12 years.

636
00:38:06,290 --> 00:38:08,060
It tells you that certain
things happening and,

637
00:38:08,420 --> 00:38:12,700
but I couldn't help but reminding
people about this match 85,

638
00:38:12,710 --> 00:38:16,970
because I say that it was a golden age.
Yeah. Machines for week my hair or strong.

639
00:38:19,180 --> 00:38:23,350
Yes. We're entering another very exciting,
I think, interesting era. I think a,

640
00:38:23,380 --> 00:38:25,980
let's all thank Gary for
an amazing discussion.

641
00:38:26,760 --> 00:38:31,010
[inaudible].
