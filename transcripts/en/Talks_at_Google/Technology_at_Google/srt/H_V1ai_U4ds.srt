00:00:06,080 --> 00:00:10,520
Thank you to Mike and to Google for
inviting me in today to talk about my very

2
00:00:10,521 --> 00:00:14,600
personal journey down the rabbit hole
of Emoji over the last 18 months,

3
00:00:15,110 --> 00:00:18,410
the sequence of events which led me to
the creation of the woman's blue flat

4
00:00:18,411 --> 00:00:22,880
shoe and my subsequent conviction in
the power of Emoji to enrich the pop

5
00:00:22,881 --> 00:00:27,170
cultural landscape and simultaneously
be a very subtle catalyst for change.

6
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:30,350
As an image emoji enthusiast,

7
00:00:30,380 --> 00:00:33,830
it's great fun for me to think about
this vision visual lexicon which has

8
00:00:33,831 --> 00:00:37,220
exploded and more importantly
where it's going. However,

9
00:00:37,250 --> 00:00:38,960
it's very much a new area for me.

10
00:00:39,260 --> 00:00:43,210
Had someone told me 18 months ago that I
would create an Emoji that would become

11
00:00:43,220 --> 00:00:46,100
acquisio lab and be anointed
as a feminist symbol,

12
00:00:46,310 --> 00:00:49,910
I genuinely would have
chuckled and yet here we are.

13
00:00:50,720 --> 00:00:55,100
When I look at this little Emoji available
and over 20 billion smart connected

14
00:00:55,101 --> 00:00:56,660
devices across the globe,

15
00:00:57,140 --> 00:01:02,140
I see my worldview reflected and
represented in a small yet perfect little

16
00:01:02,931 --> 00:01:03,764
illustration.

17
00:01:04,490 --> 00:01:08,600
That worldview is the product
of my twin occupations.

18
00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:13,760
The first as a fiercely committed mother
to four young daughters and the second

19
00:01:13,790 --> 00:01:18,110
as a media strategist within the
arts and culture sphere. As a mother,

20
00:01:18,170 --> 00:01:21,650
I spent a lot of time thinking about
early childhood language acquisition and

21
00:01:21,651 --> 00:01:26,651
screen time literacy and implicit
gender bias is faced by women in all age

22
00:01:27,051 --> 00:01:29,480
groups.
As an arts professional,

23
00:01:29,810 --> 00:01:33,710
I have a profound belief and deep
conviction and the knowledge produced by

24
00:01:33,711 --> 00:01:38,711
artists and they're unparalleled ability
to tap into the psych guys before many

25
00:01:39,441 --> 00:01:39,861
others do.

26
00:01:39,861 --> 00:01:44,861
So I do also see the world and
experience it through a very visual lens.

27
00:01:45,230 --> 00:01:49,340
It isn't that paradigm and the combination
of these two occupations that led me

28
00:01:49,341 --> 00:01:52,130
to this little Emoji that
launched a thousand thoughts.

29
00:01:52,430 --> 00:01:56,180
Bear with me as I try to tackle
a few of them. As I mentioned,

30
00:01:56,350 --> 00:02:00,080
I am the mother to these four formidable
daughters ranging from seven years old

31
00:02:00,081 --> 00:02:01,820
to 10 weeks.
However,

32
00:02:01,850 --> 00:02:06,850
stepping back to spring 2017 I was chess
beginning to reemerge from the newborn

33
00:02:06,861 --> 00:02:08,870
vortex as my third daughter,

34
00:02:08,900 --> 00:02:12,140
the blonde started inching her way
towards sleeping through the night.

35
00:02:12,590 --> 00:02:17,590
She had joined us in November of 2016
on election night no less and was our

36
00:02:18,741 --> 00:02:23,090
first us born child by May,

37
00:02:23,090 --> 00:02:26,840
2017 my partner and I had finally
arrived at that happy equilibrium in the

38
00:02:26,841 --> 00:02:30,680
family dynamic where one of you
following the addition of a new child is

39
00:02:30,681 --> 00:02:33,440
actually comfortable being left
alone with all of your children

40
00:02:35,240 --> 00:02:38,060
and so on.
This glorious weekend in May,

41
00:02:38,120 --> 00:02:41,780
I tore through my way through some
very unglamorous but highly practical

42
00:02:41,781 --> 00:02:45,170
Saturday chores mostly related
to those with domestic sphere.

43
00:02:47,060 --> 00:02:49,850
Our first stop was the local
grocery store. Now keep in mind,

44
00:02:49,851 --> 00:02:53,240
we all live in Palo Alto where the produce
is incredible and this presentation

45
00:02:53,241 --> 00:02:55,130
is something of a visual feast.
Yeah.

46
00:02:55,130 --> 00:02:59,260
My Saturday morning shopping in
no way resembles alert. Sure, yes.

47
00:02:59,261 --> 00:03:01,120
The UX quite the opposite.

48
00:03:01,450 --> 00:03:04,270
It's more of a military
grade blitzkrieg operation.

49
00:03:04,810 --> 00:03:08,920
On this particular day as I grabbed the
shopping cart to where's my kids around

50
00:03:08,921 --> 00:03:09,790
the produce section,

51
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:14,200
I instructed our two older girls who are
five and three at the time to sit down

52
00:03:14,201 --> 00:03:17,320
near the book carousel era. Yet.
Our local grocery store. Yes,

53
00:03:17,321 --> 00:03:19,540
there are books for
children there and yes,

54
00:03:19,541 --> 00:03:22,750
my children sit down on the floor and
read them while I try and choose our

55
00:03:22,751 --> 00:03:26,980
fruits and vegetables. Now normally
this would be done in lightening speed,

56
00:03:27,160 --> 00:03:30,550
but that morning are happy.
Chaos was abruptly interrupted.

57
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:36,120
The book that both of my children had
chosen was this one polite as a princess.

58
00:03:37,390 --> 00:03:42,160
I tried all be it in vain
for a few seconds and my
sleep deprived Hayes to turn

59
00:03:42,161 --> 00:03:45,490
the carousel and look for its male
counterpart, polite as a prince.

60
00:03:46,150 --> 00:03:49,150
Extra come as no surprise that it
didn't exist. It still doesn't.

61
00:03:49,660 --> 00:03:52,030
So I removed the bucks
from my daughter's hands,

62
00:03:52,090 --> 00:03:54,930
place them in the cart and
made my way the checkout lane.

63
00:03:54,960 --> 00:03:59,410
Well simultaneously expressing
my disappointment with
this book using Disney's

64
00:03:59,470 --> 00:04:00,640
Instagram Hashtag

65
00:04:02,860 --> 00:04:04,480
next up we crossed the street.

66
00:04:04,540 --> 00:04:08,380
It's our local baby boutique where on
my punch list with the desire to replace

67
00:04:08,381 --> 00:04:09,820
my existing baby carrier,

68
00:04:10,150 --> 00:04:13,510
which was now five years
old and egregiously stained
because sure they have the

69
00:04:13,511 --> 00:04:16,450
design and the materials had gone through
some innovations since I originally

70
00:04:16,451 --> 00:04:17,284
bought mine.

71
00:04:17,950 --> 00:04:22,630
As I reviewed the new options and there
were literally 20 boxes on the shelves,

72
00:04:22,840 --> 00:04:24,790
I had an alarming realization.

73
00:04:25,330 --> 00:04:29,620
Only one package among the 20 depicted
a male figure toting his child.

74
00:04:30,070 --> 00:04:32,020
It was a Norwegian brand called stocky.

75
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:38,260
It seemed that only Norwegian fathers
carried their children frustrated by this

76
00:04:38,261 --> 00:04:42,760
visual reminder that women are expected
to literally carry the brunt of child

77
00:04:42,761 --> 00:04:44,050
rearing responsibilities.

78
00:04:44,290 --> 00:04:48,040
I hot stepped out of the store with
my three daughters and went home.

79
00:04:48,730 --> 00:04:49,720
As a side note,

80
00:04:50,020 --> 00:04:53,650
this very topic became something of a
rather viral episode a few months ago,

81
00:04:53,651 --> 00:04:57,280
which some of you may have seen when
Piers Morgan took to Twitter, Twitter,

82
00:04:57,400 --> 00:05:02,220
and insulted Daniel Craig, a
k bond for toting his kid. Um,

83
00:05:02,260 --> 00:05:05,950
in a similar spirit that Wall Street
Journal recently published a huge feature

84
00:05:06,190 --> 00:05:11,020
on male focus designed carriers displaying
such masculine motifs of camouflage

85
00:05:11,021 --> 00:05:12,190
and neutral color ways.

86
00:05:14,860 --> 00:05:17,740
It would only be later that
night as I was nursing the baby,

87
00:05:17,741 --> 00:05:19,000
while everyone was asleep,

88
00:05:19,001 --> 00:05:22,780
that the stilettos appearance became the
mod that broke the proverbial camel's

89
00:05:22,781 --> 00:05:27,280
back. I was sending a message to a friend
in Europe when I type the seemingly

90
00:05:27,281 --> 00:05:28,810
innocuous word shoe,

91
00:05:29,380 --> 00:05:34,000
and it was the first time that I noticed
that Emoji auto populated and this was

92
00:05:34,001 --> 00:05:38,530
what appeared and in it I saw
the final visual reminder.

93
00:05:38,770 --> 00:05:40,900
This time in the view
that virtual universe,

94
00:05:41,200 --> 00:05:45,280
that of all the unrealistic
expectations bestowed upon women,

95
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:51,240
how does one begin to unpack the litany
of thoughts that entered my mind at 3:00

96
00:05:51,400 --> 00:05:52,930
AM when I saw this symbol,

97
00:05:53,590 --> 00:05:56,950
this small little picture that
said to me that we as women,

98
00:05:57,170 --> 00:05:59,630
I expect it to lock the
world in high heels.

99
00:06:01,660 --> 00:06:03,340
I think this is a great place to start.

100
00:06:04,780 --> 00:06:09,520
This is a work by a hot young artists,
male artists name Torbjorn.

101
00:06:09,521 --> 00:06:12,880
Roland was represented by David Carr,
Gansky gallery in Los Angeles.

102
00:06:13,450 --> 00:06:18,250
In this singular image, the
stiletto evokes danger, seduction,

103
00:06:18,610 --> 00:06:21,670
provocation with more than
a soup soon with pain.

104
00:06:22,150 --> 00:06:25,000
It's a tool of power
which women off to own.

105
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:27,210
Okay.

106
00:06:27,210 --> 00:06:31,140
Yeah. This was my reality. This
photograph is by Vivian Maier,

107
00:06:31,260 --> 00:06:35,160
who some of you may have
seen the documentary and
it's very much like most of

108
00:06:35,161 --> 00:06:36,240
her photographic,
Ugh,

109
00:06:36,480 --> 00:06:40,140
anonymous that was showing this women
who was anonymously shot without the

110
00:06:40,141 --> 00:06:45,141
consent of the subject in the 70s this
woman in Manhattan is wearing that shoe

111
00:06:46,200 --> 00:06:50,880
and is literally injured and has even
gone to the lengths of crafting a heel for

112
00:06:50,881 --> 00:06:51,714
her cast.

113
00:06:52,260 --> 00:06:56,600
And so I began to ask myself whether
my aversions to stilettos with simply a

114
00:06:56,601 --> 00:07:00,840
unique byproduct of spending literally
the last eight years, either pregnant,

115
00:07:01,110 --> 00:07:05,280
carrying a baby on my torso, pushing
a stroller, or bending over, well,

116
00:07:05,281 --> 00:07:08,490
helping a little person learn to walk.
In other words,

117
00:07:08,491 --> 00:07:12,900
was my mom attire in the footwear
category, an isolated experience.

118
00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:17,450
The resounding answer after weeks of
research, which was ultimately informed,

119
00:07:17,451 --> 00:07:20,610
my emoji proposal was no,
it was not isolated.

120
00:07:22,590 --> 00:07:26,490
I started looking at the history of
footwear and what I under very quickly was

121
00:07:26,491 --> 00:07:30,330
that the red high heel and all of its
implications that accompany it date back

122
00:07:30,331 --> 00:07:32,880
at least 70 years to the days of mad men.

123
00:07:33,330 --> 00:07:36,590
The following is a small sampling
of the vintage. As I unearth.

124
00:07:48,150 --> 00:07:50,010
I particularly liked this one,

125
00:07:50,130 --> 00:07:54,390
which is actually an editorial from the
New Yorker magazine in the 1950s can

126
00:07:54,391 --> 00:07:58,200
anyone guess who it is?
It's Andy Warhol.

127
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:01,020
Not only is it done by Warhol,

128
00:08:01,050 --> 00:08:05,760
but the red high heel is literally
equated with success for female workers in

129
00:08:05,761 --> 00:08:07,950
New York City.
Interestingly,

130
00:08:07,951 --> 00:08:12,240
I actually discovered this spread on the
Whitney's Instagram stories from their

131
00:08:12,241 --> 00:08:15,810
current major Warhol retrospective,
the first and over 30 years.

132
00:08:16,620 --> 00:08:19,770
Shifting my gaze from
historical ads and editorials,

133
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:23,700
I turned my eye to the contemporary and
started examining how footwear is used

134
00:08:23,701 --> 00:08:25,320
to communicate to women today,

135
00:08:26,040 --> 00:08:30,180
and what I found was that we have
made no progress in many ways.

136
00:08:30,300 --> 00:08:31,620
I think it's actually worsened.

137
00:08:33,040 --> 00:08:33,750
Okay.

138
00:08:33,750 --> 00:08:38,070
Here's an ad from the breastfeeding
lobbying group in the UK in which you can

139
00:08:38,071 --> 00:08:40,950
save your money from formula
to be a yummy or money.

140
00:08:43,040 --> 00:08:45,530
Here's one from Clinique.
I would challenge to ask,

141
00:08:45,531 --> 00:08:47,660
where's the comfort in the Red Stiletto?

142
00:08:49,210 --> 00:08:49,890
Okay.

143
00:08:49,890 --> 00:08:50,790
In this Geico ad,

144
00:08:50,791 --> 00:08:53,940
women are literally encouraged to switch
their insurance policy so they can

145
00:08:53,941 --> 00:08:58,380
famously save, redeploy said savings.
To the things they love. Red Pumps.

146
00:08:59,340 --> 00:09:03,330
Interestingly, the male counterpart of
this ad, which appears in men's magazines,

147
00:09:03,331 --> 00:09:07,500
is a big hunk of steak
in this one.

148
00:09:07,501 --> 00:09:09,450
Another great export from the UK.

149
00:09:09,451 --> 00:09:13,350
The National Service Health
Service Equates motherhood
with the abandonment of a

150
00:09:13,351 --> 00:09:15,810
very specific version of female hood.

151
00:09:18,260 --> 00:09:22,700
Here we have the TSA espousing
better convenience at the
airport while traveling.

152
00:09:23,090 --> 00:09:27,290
Yet I would challenge that the most
inconvenient part of removing shoes is

153
00:09:27,291 --> 00:09:30,710
actually shoes with
laces, not the heel. Plus,

154
00:09:30,711 --> 00:09:34,070
I don't know many women who actually
wear heels well traipsing across the

155
00:09:34,071 --> 00:09:34,904
airport.

156
00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:36,550
Okay.

157
00:09:36,550 --> 00:09:40,810
The U s postal service equates fashion
with high heels and suggest that neither

158
00:09:40,840 --> 00:09:43,870
fashion nor the post
office rest on Sundays.

159
00:09:45,430 --> 00:09:49,450
Zappos a category buster, which I'll
return to later in the footwear space,

160
00:09:49,720 --> 00:09:52,870
suggest that women all love red stilettos.

161
00:09:54,740 --> 00:09:58,250
Barclays in urging financial
literacy and acumen, again,

162
00:09:58,251 --> 00:10:02,090
suggest that those funds that you
save should be spent on shoes.

163
00:10:04,110 --> 00:10:04,470
Okay.

164
00:10:04,470 --> 00:10:06,000
The newly launched magazine,

165
00:10:06,001 --> 00:10:09,510
which went viral earlier this month and
some of you may have seen because of a

166
00:10:09,511 --> 00:10:12,510
sensationalist image of Rachel
McAdams pumping and designer.

167
00:10:12,511 --> 00:10:17,010
Where has this tagline bringing
back the woman stiletto?

168
00:10:17,850 --> 00:10:20,760
I find it ironic given
the title of the magazine.

169
00:10:22,350 --> 00:10:22,540
Okay.

170
00:10:22,540 --> 00:10:23,590
For giving Tuesday,

171
00:10:23,591 --> 00:10:28,090
Bruno Maglio donated a hundred pairs
of these burgundy's Suede Stilettos,

172
00:10:28,270 --> 00:10:29,740
their name to the gala pump.

173
00:10:30,610 --> 00:10:34,150
Now I would venture to say that a
woman who is new to the job search and

174
00:10:34,151 --> 00:10:37,600
interview process should have one
fewer thing to be thinking about,

175
00:10:37,660 --> 00:10:40,150
which is learning to walk
if in six inch stilettos.

176
00:10:42,930 --> 00:10:43,471
Of course,

177
00:10:43,471 --> 00:10:46,560
we're here at Google and one of my
very first places when I went down that

178
00:10:46,561 --> 00:10:48,990
rabbit hole was to look at
Google Arts and culture.

179
00:10:49,650 --> 00:10:54,630
This shoe is an item of four were intended
to protect and comfort the human foot

180
00:10:54,680 --> 00:10:58,350
while the where is doing various
activities, and I don't know about you,

181
00:10:58,351 --> 00:11:03,351
but nothing about this shoe made me
think of comfort or walking to Google's

182
00:11:04,201 --> 00:11:08,550
credit within 24 hours of me instagramming
it. Come on Google, you can do better.

183
00:11:08,610 --> 00:11:10,770
They changed it.
It's now a raggedy old booth.

184
00:11:14,040 --> 00:11:18,060
This is a sense that was recently launched
by Carolina Herrera and wait for it.

185
00:11:18,061 --> 00:11:19,140
It's called good girl.

186
00:11:21,610 --> 00:11:21,780
Okay.

187
00:11:21,780 --> 00:11:26,070
The text used to, uh, to get
women to buy it says it all.

188
00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:30,750
It's good to be bad, provocative,
intent, lethal charisma,

189
00:11:31,290 --> 00:11:34,980
seductive charisma, and there's no
escape. It's about ruthless power.

190
00:11:36,930 --> 00:11:40,590
Now that we've spent some time
investigating how stilettos are generally

191
00:11:40,591 --> 00:11:41,401
depicted and the way,

192
00:11:41,401 --> 00:11:44,310
the expectations that they carry
with them as a visual emblem,

193
00:11:44,610 --> 00:11:48,390
I wanted to talk also by my
observations with Emoji specifically,

194
00:11:48,570 --> 00:11:51,000
which have been formed through
the eyes of my young children.

195
00:11:51,570 --> 00:11:56,380
As I mentioned at the, I was very
much an Emoji novice 18 months ago.

196
00:11:56,770 --> 00:12:00,460
Only the casual sort of kissed sending
face or the heart appeared in my text

197
00:12:00,461 --> 00:12:05,050
messaging. Yet this all changed when
my children began attending school.

198
00:12:05,380 --> 00:12:08,680
And suddenly emojis seem
to be literally everywhere.

199
00:12:10,700 --> 00:12:15,080
So let's talk about how much my children
love Emoji and how omnipresent they are

200
00:12:15,081 --> 00:12:18,140
in their daily existence.
Because in many ways,

201
00:12:18,141 --> 00:12:20,780
the impetus to create my
flat shoe Emoji was one,

202
00:12:20,781 --> 00:12:23,450
driven by parental
responsibility and duty.

203
00:12:24,260 --> 00:12:28,490
If my kids were going to be using Emoji
and seeing them repeatedly in their

204
00:12:28,491 --> 00:12:29,324
routines,

205
00:12:29,410 --> 00:12:33,140
shouldn't I at least try to create
some semblance of balance to the three

206
00:12:33,141 --> 00:12:35,390
existing high heeled options that existed?

207
00:12:36,850 --> 00:12:37,160
Yeah,

208
00:12:37,160 --> 00:12:38,220
there was a peril.

209
00:12:40,430 --> 00:12:40,740
Okay.

210
00:12:40,740 --> 00:12:45,480
You can make bracelets with Emoji,
you can wear your Emoji to school,

211
00:12:46,410 --> 00:12:49,920
you can keep your inner most thoughts
and an Emoji diary and if you don't feel

212
00:12:49,921 --> 00:12:52,980
like describing your emotions,
you can use the Emoji stickers.

213
00:12:54,360 --> 00:12:54,610
Okay.

214
00:12:54,610 --> 00:12:58,420
You can get national geographic to
help you decode the Emoji language.

215
00:12:59,230 --> 00:13:04,180
Literally at this point I had accepted
that my children were using Emoji,

216
00:13:04,420 --> 00:13:07,900
not necessarily as a language
but as an expressive play thing.

217
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:13,320
So I turned to the other world that I
know and love and occupy the arts and I

218
00:13:13,991 --> 00:13:17,680
started thinking about how artists were
engaging with the subject matter and it

219
00:13:17,681 --> 00:13:21,670
became very clear that they too were
questioning the broader sentiment.

220
00:13:21,940 --> 00:13:24,820
That emoji were simple little play things,
throwaways,

221
00:13:25,090 --> 00:13:27,490
a trend to be dismissed and outgrown

222
00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:33,580
the original Emoji set here,
which I'm sure many of you know,

223
00:13:33,720 --> 00:13:36,220
it seems like a really good
place to start released.

224
00:13:36,221 --> 00:13:41,110
Exactly 20 years ago in 1999
and including 176 Emoji.

225
00:13:41,350 --> 00:13:42,730
It's acquisition by Moma.

226
00:13:42,731 --> 00:13:45,970
Last year it was certainly viewed
as a legitimizing watershed moment.

227
00:13:46,660 --> 00:13:50,590
Moments collection in New York is filled
with examples of design innovations

228
00:13:50,770 --> 00:13:54,130
that radically altered our world,
so for Emoji,

229
00:13:54,160 --> 00:13:58,810
including the little red pixelated
stiletto next to the scissors and the

230
00:13:58,811 --> 00:14:03,460
hamburger to be come. Part of that
collection was historically significant.

231
00:14:04,330 --> 00:14:06,670
Now that institutional
backing was in place.

232
00:14:06,820 --> 00:14:08,920
I was really curious about
how artists themselves,

233
00:14:08,921 --> 00:14:10,180
we're dealing with Emoji today.

234
00:14:11,840 --> 00:14:12,400
Yeah.

235
00:14:12,400 --> 00:14:17,140
I first came across this image last
August via Mary Boone Galleries Instagram

236
00:14:17,141 --> 00:14:21,610
page. It depicts the fist and the
painting nail Emoji and my curiosity,

237
00:14:21,611 --> 00:14:25,630
as you can imagine, was immediately
piqued. The work is by Derek Adams,

238
00:14:25,720 --> 00:14:29,680
a young African American multidisciplinary
artist based in Brooklyn who might

239
00:14:29,681 --> 00:14:34,060
have been following for some time when
I contacted the gallery a few weeks ago.

240
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:37,960
For the purpose of this presentation
and to learn more about this painting,

241
00:14:38,110 --> 00:14:38,681
it emerged.

242
00:14:38,681 --> 00:14:42,370
That is actually part of a whole new
body of work which will be shown in March

243
00:14:42,430 --> 00:14:47,430
entitled new icons through multiple
layers of CNC applied paint and also by

244
00:14:48,431 --> 00:14:49,264
hand.

245
00:14:49,300 --> 00:14:54,300
Derek has purposely mimicked the digital
world and he's created this new series

246
00:14:54,321 --> 00:14:59,321
of portraits using only the Emoji
library as a point of reference to an

247
00:15:00,111 --> 00:15:03,170
individual that because of
his or her radical nature,

248
00:15:03,410 --> 00:15:06,140
Adam's feels is important
to American popular culture.

249
00:15:06,890 --> 00:15:10,460
This specific work is of a woman named
sister Souljah with some of you might

250
00:15:10,461 --> 00:15:14,810
know is an author activist and was known
for the sister Souljah and move moment

251
00:15:14,811 --> 00:15:16,910
during the Bill Clinton
presidential campaign.

252
00:15:17,510 --> 00:15:22,370
So here we have a highly engaged artist
exploring the force of popular culture

253
00:15:22,610 --> 00:15:27,290
and the media on the perception
and construction of self
image using Emoji as a

254
00:15:27,291 --> 00:15:29,630
vehicle and a whole new
form of portraiture.

255
00:15:31,190 --> 00:15:31,400
Okay,

256
00:15:31,400 --> 00:15:33,500
next up I looked to Laura Owens,

257
00:15:33,530 --> 00:15:37,250
the brilliant female artist in La who
is known for her large scale paintings

258
00:15:37,251 --> 00:15:40,940
that intertwine art historical
references with painterly techniques.

259
00:15:41,480 --> 00:15:46,480
I was fascinated by this installation
from 2015 in a club called the dirty rag

260
00:15:46,671 --> 00:15:48,860
soccer club club in Chicago,

261
00:15:49,130 --> 00:15:52,040
which is an exhibition space
and the former Polish soccer bar

262
00:15:53,590 --> 00:15:58,590
and it Owen's installed hundreds of
these emoji ceramic sculptures above the

263
00:15:59,131 --> 00:16:02,570
fully functional bar office at
her paintings there were literate,

264
00:16:02,571 --> 00:16:07,571
she made by hand 426 Emoji sculptures
and they're 383 of them which are

265
00:16:08,691 --> 00:16:13,691
available if anybody wants to buy
when I'm taking it one step further.

266
00:16:14,180 --> 00:16:19,180
Actually last November in 2017 to coincide
with her major retrospective at the

267
00:16:20,420 --> 00:16:22,620
Whitney Museum,
they went up to it and they clever.

268
00:16:22,621 --> 00:16:25,100
They converted each of these Emoji into

269
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:30,850
a free digital sticker pack,
which I love and use incessantly.

270
00:16:32,590 --> 00:16:35,680
And another example of a contemporary
artist incorporating Emoji.

271
00:16:35,860 --> 00:16:37,330
I turned to Trevor Paglen,

272
00:16:37,390 --> 00:16:41,380
the Macarthur Genius Prize winner and
previous artist in resident at Stanford's

273
00:16:41,381 --> 00:16:42,340
cantor art center.

274
00:16:42,970 --> 00:16:46,600
Haglin is widely known for an artistic
practice which seeks to expose and

275
00:16:46,601 --> 00:16:50,050
investigate areas that don't wish
to be examined. Surveillance,

276
00:16:50,130 --> 00:16:52,210
military operations,
intelligence.

277
00:16:52,570 --> 00:16:57,010
He played a crucial whirl and with Laura
Poitras and citizen four and his body

278
00:16:57,011 --> 00:17:00,760
of work is currently on show at the
Smithsonian and a major mid career survey

279
00:17:00,761 --> 00:17:04,930
exhibition. This specific work
known as the symbology series,

280
00:17:05,140 --> 00:17:08,590
looks at the totemic visual language
inherent in military culture.

281
00:17:09,610 --> 00:17:10,170
Okay.

282
00:17:10,170 --> 00:17:14,880
A typical uniform will sport patches
identifying its where its job program,

283
00:17:14,881 --> 00:17:17,790
affiliation, achievements and
place. Within that hierarchy,

284
00:17:18,270 --> 00:17:22,500
these markers of identity and program
heraldry begin to create a very peculiar

285
00:17:22,501 --> 00:17:26,010
symbolic regime when they,
they picked ones affiliation with that,

286
00:17:26,280 --> 00:17:29,370
with what the defense industry
insiders called the black world,

287
00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:31,320
the world of classified programs,

288
00:17:31,321 --> 00:17:36,321
projects and places whose outlines and
even existence our deeply held secrets.

289
00:17:38,700 --> 00:17:39,280
Okay.

290
00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:42,490
And finally I turned to the
legendary John Baldessari,

291
00:17:42,550 --> 00:17:45,490
who at 87 years old remains
as forward thinking,

292
00:17:45,491 --> 00:17:50,190
has ever known for using found imagery
that he recomposes by carefully selecting

293
00:17:50,191 --> 00:17:52,260
pictures,
pairing them with text,

294
00:17:52,350 --> 00:17:56,400
and often overlaying them with large
dots and swaths of color to mask or bring

295
00:17:56,401 --> 00:18:00,180
attention to the areas of detail.
For this series of paintings.

296
00:18:00,181 --> 00:18:04,770
He focused on the Animal
Emoji specifically taking
this interest in issues of

297
00:18:04,771 --> 00:18:07,140
context and cultural specificity.
Further,

298
00:18:07,380 --> 00:18:10,260
the new emoji series
evaluated the ubiquitous,

299
00:18:10,261 --> 00:18:14,220
seemingly innocuous images that
we use in everyday conversations

300
00:18:16,290 --> 00:18:20,700
and then this past November
Baldisari they a new emoji series.

301
00:18:21,030 --> 00:18:25,530
Some of the text is ironic and suggestive
while some seem completely random,

302
00:18:25,680 --> 00:18:30,270
thus challenging the viewer to make
sense out of the pairings. Well,

303
00:18:30,271 --> 00:18:34,410
emojis are indeed straightforward images
that take the place of their real life

304
00:18:34,411 --> 00:18:38,220
words Baldessari his work
seemed to suggest that their
meanings are not actually

305
00:18:38,221 --> 00:18:41,010
set and I'd rather
subject to interpretation.

306
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:44,910
These universal images that
transcend cultural, social,

307
00:18:44,970 --> 00:18:49,020
and linguistic boundaries are easily
subverted when removed from their iPhone

308
00:18:49,021 --> 00:18:51,780
context and paired within different text.

309
00:18:52,840 --> 00:18:53,100
Okay.

310
00:18:53,100 --> 00:18:57,750
Even the hyper bright white background
of the works seems to recall the lighting

311
00:18:57,751 --> 00:19:00,540
of the phone background where
these are typically seen.

312
00:19:00,840 --> 00:19:04,830
Thus making the artwork itself represents
something beyond its material nature.

313
00:19:06,120 --> 00:19:08,550
If you're curious,
the peaches sold out.

314
00:19:09,870 --> 00:19:10,703
Yeah.

315
00:19:11,060 --> 00:19:12,890
More recently,
a couple of weeks ago,

316
00:19:12,891 --> 00:19:16,970
the Prado Museum in Madrid released
its own bespoke Emoji via Twitter to

317
00:19:16,971 --> 00:19:18,890
celebrate its 200 anniversary.

318
00:19:19,040 --> 00:19:23,600
So if you hashtag add the product 200
you immediately got this wonderful light

319
00:19:23,601 --> 00:19:24,434
button.

320
00:19:26,380 --> 00:19:30,490
Segwaying now from the art world context
and into the unexpected applications of

321
00:19:30,491 --> 00:19:31,324
Emoji.

322
00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:35,680
Here you have an example of actual
text being translated into Emoji,

323
00:19:35,950 --> 00:19:39,070
which made me think we'll Google
translate offer that service.

324
00:19:40,500 --> 00:19:40,860
Okay.

325
00:19:40,860 --> 00:19:44,670
The traditional Emoji naitivity when which
went around and was widely circulated

326
00:19:44,671 --> 00:19:45,630
during the holidays.

327
00:19:47,700 --> 00:19:48,330
Okay.

328
00:19:48,330 --> 00:19:51,150
A portmanteau of Emoji to
describe that sensation.

329
00:19:51,151 --> 00:19:53,790
Many of us are currently
feeling back at work.

330
00:19:56,010 --> 00:19:56,843
Okay.

331
00:19:57,310 --> 00:20:01,440
This is one of my favorites.
Shopping by Emoji again, Zappos.

332
00:20:01,720 --> 00:20:05,230
So if you go into the Zappos App,
you can actually shot by Emoji,

333
00:20:05,560 --> 00:20:08,290
but unfortunately, if you're a
woman who's looking for a flat shoe,

334
00:20:08,440 --> 00:20:13,240
it's not readily visible. However, the
next few screens do show what you get.

335
00:20:13,241 --> 00:20:16,900
When you put in,
say the Mermaid Emoji and the lips Emoji.

336
00:20:18,090 --> 00:20:20,310
I did contact Zappos,
they assure me it's in there now.

337
00:20:20,311 --> 00:20:23,910
So if you put in my little flat shoe,
you get pages and pages of ballet flats.

338
00:20:25,770 --> 00:20:29,700
This is a page from the December
issue of Elle magazine. Again,

339
00:20:30,630 --> 00:20:34,260
shopping for your loved ones
based on their emoji usage.

340
00:20:34,860 --> 00:20:36,210
I found this on Instagram.

341
00:20:38,030 --> 00:20:38,640
Okay.

342
00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:42,120
This one also went viral,
which is quite fun and entertaining,

343
00:20:42,150 --> 00:20:44,940
looking at emoji usage on
a national country level.

344
00:20:45,420 --> 00:20:47,830
And they began to make me think,
hmm,

345
00:20:47,890 --> 00:20:51,310
our emoji usage actually
sort of the national psyche.

346
00:20:52,060 --> 00:20:53,680
And what does that mean for profiling?

347
00:20:55,650 --> 00:21:00,480
There's a good aspect of emoji targeting
like this endangered species campaign.

348
00:21:01,020 --> 00:21:02,550
And for those of you that don't know,

349
00:21:02,760 --> 00:21:07,760
you can actually buy emoji usage data
from Twitter and then use it for your

350
00:21:08,251 --> 00:21:12,420
marketing campaigns. So while this is
a fantastic illustration of that tool,

351
00:21:12,660 --> 00:21:15,870
another option is you're sitting watching
the Superbowl and you're tweeting at

352
00:21:15,871 --> 00:21:19,200
your friend that you're about to order
pizza and you get a discount code from

353
00:21:19,201 --> 00:21:19,860
Domino's.

354
00:21:19,860 --> 00:21:23,070
And then the next week you get a discount
code for Jenny Craig for a weight loss

355
00:21:23,071 --> 00:21:26,870
program. Another unexpected byproduct. My,

356
00:21:26,871 --> 00:21:31,010
my Emoji journey was learning that
at the University of Michigan,

357
00:21:31,011 --> 00:21:32,510
within the art history department,

358
00:21:32,690 --> 00:21:35,720
there exist a class for
undergraduates called Emoji worlds.

359
00:21:35,930 --> 00:21:40,400
It's taught by Jim [inaudible] who has
a phd in art history and a specialty in

360
00:21:40,401 --> 00:21:44,570
Asian art contemporary,
but also has a JD from Yale law school.

361
00:21:44,900 --> 00:21:46,640
And this class,
um,

362
00:21:46,790 --> 00:21:51,790
spends about 12 weeks looking at
every aspect of Emoji for their final

363
00:21:51,951 --> 00:21:52,580
assignment.

364
00:21:52,580 --> 00:21:57,580
They were each required to submit an
Emoji proposal and guaranteed the Ne plus

365
00:21:58,431 --> 00:22:00,080
by the way,
if it got adopted.

366
00:22:00,540 --> 00:22:01,373
Sure.

367
00:22:02,950 --> 00:22:06,880
And with this image, I want to finish
on the significance of design thinking.

368
00:22:07,270 --> 00:22:09,640
Everything about this
crosswalk makes me smile.

369
00:22:11,080 --> 00:22:11,913
It's insane.

370
00:22:13,540 --> 00:22:18,190
And yet the design and interpretation
of my emoji across some platforms was

371
00:22:18,191 --> 00:22:23,191
absolutely disheartening as though the
intent of the Emoji at its very core had

372
00:22:23,471 --> 00:22:26,470
been completely overlooked.
I'll let you guess which ones.

373
00:22:30,450 --> 00:22:35,100
When John Baldessari was asked about his
new emoji series, he wants responded.

374
00:22:35,160 --> 00:22:39,930
That Emoji to him represented the most
Democrat Democratic living language.

375
00:22:40,200 --> 00:22:44,010
It is crowdsourced after all
and that every time you use one,

376
00:22:44,100 --> 00:22:47,280
you are in essence casting a vote.
With that thought.

377
00:22:47,340 --> 00:22:52,340
I wanted to point out the
design difference in the
newly adopted brick Emoji and

378
00:22:53,460 --> 00:22:56,070
leave you to thinking about
what vote you are casting.

379
00:22:58,900 --> 00:22:59,733
Thank you.

380
00:23:05,280 --> 00:23:08,360
Thank you for coming
to Google. Uh, and uh,

381
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:13,050
telling your story that it's fascinating
to me every time I hear it. So I mean,

382
00:23:13,260 --> 00:23:17,440
I really, really appreciate
it. Thank you. Um,

383
00:23:18,390 --> 00:23:21,030
I wasn't going to ask
you which implementation,

384
00:23:21,090 --> 00:23:26,090
I mean you've been all over with this
Emoji campaign now that you see it in real

385
00:23:26,461 --> 00:23:30,540
life. Um, which implementation
are you the happiest with?

386
00:23:30,570 --> 00:23:33,780
I won't ask you which one you don't like
flipping it. That was pretty obvious.

387
00:23:33,850 --> 00:23:38,500
I think the apple Emoji was the truest
to the initial design. I said my dad,

388
00:23:38,530 --> 00:23:42,940
it was Prussian blue,
which was a very concerned choice,

389
00:23:43,050 --> 00:23:47,330
um, to sort of flip on its head.
The whole idea of blue is for boys,

390
00:23:47,331 --> 00:23:50,690
pink is for girls. Um, and I also,

391
00:23:51,020 --> 00:23:54,830
one of the sort of unexpected surprises
that I loved actually about the Apple

392
00:23:54,830 --> 00:23:59,570
Emoji is that where all the other shoes
are actually displayed at a 45 degree

393
00:23:59,600 --> 00:24:04,100
tilt, apple went further and
truly made it flat and horizontal,

394
00:24:04,220 --> 00:24:09,220
which wasn't something I had considered
and yet it really accentuates the

395
00:24:09,261 --> 00:24:10,730
flatness of it.
Um,

396
00:24:10,940 --> 00:24:15,940
I also loved that within the Apple
Emoji architecture and order,

397
00:24:16,110 --> 00:24:18,500
the flat sheet actually
precedes the Stiletto.

398
00:24:18,560 --> 00:24:21,290
So when you scroll through
the apparel category,

399
00:24:21,500 --> 00:24:25,250
the flat shoe is the very first
one and that made me smile a lot.

400
00:24:26,290 --> 00:24:28,270
That's great.
Can you tell us a little bit,

401
00:24:28,271 --> 00:24:32,780
you told me about how you actually went
about designing the flat shoe emerging

402
00:24:32,830 --> 00:24:35,200
in the first place. Um, you,

403
00:24:35,410 --> 00:24:38,950
you spoke to an artist friend and then
you had some very specific requirements

404
00:24:39,310 --> 00:24:41,950
of how you want it drawn and why you
wanted it to pick it a certain way.

405
00:24:41,951 --> 00:24:43,240
I thought it was really interesting.

406
00:24:43,700 --> 00:24:48,260
So I reached out to a graphic designer
named Afi masseur who had been the

407
00:24:48,261 --> 00:24:52,250
illustrator for the woman
with a headscarf, otherwise
known as the Hijab Emoji.

408
00:24:52,640 --> 00:24:55,460
And coincidentally is also a
children's book illustrator.

409
00:24:55,461 --> 00:24:59,900
And I thought she would perfectly
get what I was trying to get at.

410
00:24:59,990 --> 00:25:03,650
Um, and my directors were
really quite open. Um,

411
00:25:03,800 --> 00:25:08,750
I absolutely wanted to not to be pink.
So I said you can choose the colors,

412
00:25:08,751 --> 00:25:11,210
but it needs to be gender neutral.
Um,

413
00:25:11,240 --> 00:25:15,710
I wanted both options to be available
in terms of a flat with a bow and one

414
00:25:15,711 --> 00:25:19,180
without. Um, some people have asked
me, why did you include the bow?

415
00:25:19,181 --> 00:25:21,140
It's such an overtly feminine thing.

416
00:25:21,380 --> 00:25:24,560
And the reality is in my
research of flat shoes,

417
00:25:24,590 --> 00:25:27,950
all of the original flats had
that binding to keep the shoe on.

418
00:25:28,220 --> 00:25:32,060
And so it was actually a reference to
the historical design, a flat shoes,

419
00:25:32,061 --> 00:25:35,240
which of course are also women by men.
Um,

420
00:25:35,270 --> 00:25:40,270
and so I really wanted the
ultimate designers to have
the option of both a flat

421
00:25:40,431 --> 00:25:44,530
with a bow and one without, and
there were six color ways, um,

422
00:25:44,630 --> 00:25:49,460
and I wanted the heel to be
as non existent as possible
while still translating

423
00:25:49,461 --> 00:25:50,570
on a micro scale.

424
00:25:50,790 --> 00:25:54,900
Hmm. So you submitted several
versions of this to the Unicode?

425
00:25:55,460 --> 00:25:59,120
Yeah. So I submitted two silhouettes,
one with the bow and one without,

426
00:25:59,150 --> 00:26:03,590
and each silhouette was available in
six colors, which ranged from dark blue,

427
00:26:03,620 --> 00:26:06,620
dark green, nude, Brown, black.

428
00:26:06,940 --> 00:26:07,770
Hmm.

429
00:26:07,770 --> 00:26:12,050
So it's fascinating is that you approached
the whole Emoji proposal from the art

430
00:26:12,051 --> 00:26:15,980
world perspective, um, because
you're not in tech like,

431
00:26:16,330 --> 00:26:18,470
like everybody here and you,

432
00:26:18,740 --> 00:26:23,740
you taught yourself how to propose to
Unicode and you wrote the whole proposal

433
00:26:23,871 --> 00:26:25,560
yourself, right? What was that like?

434
00:26:25,561 --> 00:26:29,900
Like where did you start when you said
I wanted to get this Emoji accepted and

435
00:26:29,901 --> 00:26:30,411
adopted?

436
00:26:30,411 --> 00:26:33,860
Did you even know there was a Unicorn
Organization that you had to apply to and

437
00:26:34,130 --> 00:26:36,020
how did you,
how did you start that whole journey?

438
00:26:36,090 --> 00:26:38,700
It was a really fun,
um,

439
00:26:38,820 --> 00:26:43,200
I get goosebumps thinking about it
because I had an excuse to get back on of

440
00:26:43,201 --> 00:26:46,340
that student learning curve
and nerd out really. Um,

441
00:26:46,510 --> 00:26:50,100
and it all kind of happened when no one
was looking in the middle of the night

442
00:26:50,101 --> 00:26:53,910
because until that red
stiletto auto populated,

443
00:26:54,270 --> 00:26:58,320
I had no idea how Emoji were made.
I literally held my phone and I was like,

444
00:26:58,860 --> 00:27:03,510
hmm, it's apple. So smart that this
device has some sort of mythic,

445
00:27:03,540 --> 00:27:07,530
a I that knows what my shopping habits
have been for the last 12 months has

446
00:27:07,531 --> 00:27:10,920
aggregated that and therefore
this device knows this, this FEMA,

447
00:27:10,950 --> 00:27:15,950
there's a female holding this phone and
has predicted that this is the stiletto,

448
00:27:16,290 --> 00:27:18,780
that this is the shoe emoji
that's going to resonate with me.

449
00:27:19,260 --> 00:27:24,260
That was literally my justification
rationale and then I thank you Google went

450
00:27:26,101 --> 00:27:28,530
down the rabbit hole of
how I literally typed in,

451
00:27:28,650 --> 00:27:33,570
how do emoji get made and that's when
I let it on the most horrific unicode

452
00:27:33,571 --> 00:27:38,130
consortium. What page and sort of
navigated my way through the lake.

453
00:27:38,280 --> 00:27:41,100
How does one submit a proposal on?
That's when my light bulb moment went off,

454
00:27:41,101 --> 00:27:42,360
which was,
oh wait a second,

455
00:27:42,690 --> 00:27:47,460
Emoji or crowdsourced anyone from me
and Palo Alto to an 85 year old man in

456
00:27:47,461 --> 00:27:52,050
India to 15 year old girl in
Berlin can submit a proposal.

457
00:27:52,080 --> 00:27:53,760
They just need to fill out this template.

458
00:27:54,450 --> 00:27:58,770
And then once I realized that I'm actually
from a friend of mine who's in the

459
00:27:58,771 --> 00:28:03,570
audience, I reached out to
the dumpling emoji creator,

460
00:28:03,571 --> 00:28:07,950
Jennifer eight, Lee and cold emailed
her from her website and said,

461
00:28:08,070 --> 00:28:11,850
this is my idea. This is
my observation. Am I crazy?

462
00:28:12,120 --> 00:28:16,080
And with a matter of hours, she came
back to me and very succinctly said,

463
00:28:16,500 --> 00:28:19,200
this is a good idea.
The deadline is July 1st.

464
00:28:19,950 --> 00:28:24,300
And so at this point
it was June. Um, and I,

465
00:28:24,660 --> 00:28:27,810
how can I sell it? Okay, I've
actually vocalize this to someone.

466
00:28:28,230 --> 00:28:30,900
I now have my marching orders,
no pun intended.

467
00:28:31,140 --> 00:28:34,680
And I spent basically the next three
weeks putting together the proposal

468
00:28:34,710 --> 00:28:39,690
entirely on my own. Um, and
it was really fun. Um, the,

469
00:28:39,820 --> 00:28:41,490
the one thing that you know,

470
00:28:41,491 --> 00:28:44,220
I still think about is if you
go on the unicode website,

471
00:28:44,221 --> 00:28:48,300
they make a point of saying no emoji
proposal should be for a cause,

472
00:28:48,301 --> 00:28:51,390
quote unquote. Um, it will be dismissed.

473
00:28:51,870 --> 00:28:56,280
There are some Emoji that get adopted.
However, it's in spite of the cost,

474
00:28:56,340 --> 00:28:57,360
not because of it.

475
00:28:57,630 --> 00:29:01,680
And so one of the sort of lenses that
I was seeing my proposal through was

476
00:29:01,890 --> 00:29:04,440
really trying to downplay
the cause factor,

477
00:29:04,590 --> 00:29:08,490
which in fact when you look at that
Blue Shoe and you know me, you know,

478
00:29:08,520 --> 00:29:11,470
it's a blatant Leah cause driven Emoji.
Um,

479
00:29:11,520 --> 00:29:14,950
and so I had to make it as um,

480
00:29:15,570 --> 00:29:19,920
as empirical and statistically
significant as possible.

481
00:29:20,130 --> 00:29:23,730
And so I downplayed the actual
narrative and made it about usage,

482
00:29:23,731 --> 00:29:27,360
adoption and creating a really
compelling argument for it to be made.

483
00:29:27,980 --> 00:29:29,120
Fascinating.
Fascinating.

484
00:29:30,530 --> 00:29:33,680
So you're kind of all in now.

485
00:29:33,681 --> 00:29:36,950
I just said you nerded out
and you love this process.

486
00:29:37,670 --> 00:29:42,640
Some of us have to do it for work,
but you love this process. Um, and uh,

487
00:29:43,240 --> 00:29:48,100
you're not just stopping with the Flat
Soled Shoe Emoji and you're actually,

488
00:29:48,220 --> 00:29:51,580
I've heard you've actually got some
other projects in the work. Um,

489
00:29:51,700 --> 00:29:54,370
and not just for men or for women,
but men as well.

490
00:29:54,590 --> 00:29:55,423
I do.

491
00:29:55,610 --> 00:30:00,610
This past spring I coauthored a proposal
for a one piece bathing suit because

492
00:30:01,191 --> 00:30:06,191
the only swimmer option right now is an
itsy bitsy yellow polka dot bikini even

493
00:30:06,951 --> 00:30:09,290
for men, even for men. And,

494
00:30:09,530 --> 00:30:13,430
which is why the proposal actually
included a one piece swimsuit,

495
00:30:13,700 --> 00:30:18,590
a swim trunk for men and a swim
brief for men. It's now been short,

496
00:30:18,591 --> 00:30:19,424
less dead.

497
00:30:19,720 --> 00:30:22,540
Oh, right. So, so when
do you hear about that?

498
00:30:22,930 --> 00:30:26,430
I believe that committee
will vote in October. Um,

499
00:30:26,920 --> 00:30:30,970
and if all goes well and I'll
roll out next year in 2020.

500
00:30:31,700 --> 00:30:33,800
Well, if that happens, we'd
love to have you back here.

501
00:30:35,900 --> 00:30:37,400
So I don't know if you know this,

502
00:30:37,401 --> 00:30:42,020
but the Emoji sets like once the
unicode decides the Emoji, um,

503
00:30:42,350 --> 00:30:46,180
how they're actually depicted, uh, is
up to each of the companies. But as, as,

504
00:30:46,181 --> 00:30:48,030
as you pointed out,
um,

505
00:30:48,080 --> 00:30:52,220
but there's a process that we have at
Google and that you could actually get

506
00:30:52,221 --> 00:30:55,100
involved in if you wanted to
help do the Google version

507
00:30:58,160 --> 00:31:02,030
fastly and thank you for getting swim
trunks out there because every time I

508
00:31:02,031 --> 00:31:04,710
texted him, like, you know, bring
your trunks, I don't have an Emoji.

509
00:31:06,520 --> 00:31:09,430
That's great.
Um,

510
00:31:10,250 --> 00:31:12,380
I want you to get into some
of the other topics. Um,

511
00:31:15,020 --> 00:31:19,970
you said that you see Emoji as, as
more than just, uh, just as art.

512
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:23,920
It's become, it's come language. And
you touched on it a little bit, but, uh,

513
00:31:24,020 --> 00:31:25,100
we've had longer conversations,

514
00:31:25,101 --> 00:31:29,360
conversations about how you see
emoji becoming part of linguistics.

515
00:31:29,750 --> 00:31:32,210
I was wondering if you'd comment on
that because that was really fascinating

516
00:31:32,211 --> 00:31:33,590
because none of your kids are going up.

517
00:31:34,020 --> 00:31:37,240
Um,
well I'm not a an academic,

518
00:31:37,270 --> 00:31:40,990
but there is a term known
as applicationary text. Um,

519
00:31:41,320 --> 00:31:45,790
and so sort of thinking back to when
the original Emoji set were introduced

520
00:31:46,090 --> 00:31:46,481
Emoji,

521
00:31:46,481 --> 00:31:51,481
but really meant to be that aspect which
got lots in electronic messaging of the

522
00:31:51,731 --> 00:31:55,750
nonverbal, so emotional,
facial, nonverbal,

523
00:31:55,751 --> 00:31:57,490
accused intonation,

524
00:31:57,640 --> 00:32:01,570
and you were able to supplement sort
of just the purely textural with the

525
00:32:01,571 --> 00:32:03,940
nonverbal cues through an image.
Um,

526
00:32:04,330 --> 00:32:08,410
and I find that really interesting
because now when we look at Emoji usage,

527
00:32:08,590 --> 00:32:10,630
they don't necessarily replace where it's,

528
00:32:10,631 --> 00:32:15,631
but they certainly add the meaning and
the practical meaning of a sentence.

529
00:32:15,910 --> 00:32:20,530
Um, and so some would say it's part of
the linguistic channel of communication is

530
00:32:20,740 --> 00:32:24,730
these nonverbal cues that you
can now include. Um, pictorially.

531
00:32:25,030 --> 00:32:29,110
And so to me it's, it's one of
those really interesting things.

532
00:32:29,111 --> 00:32:30,850
And that also,
I mean,

533
00:32:30,851 --> 00:32:35,800
there's a reason that cliche a picture's
worth a thousand words exists. Um, and I,

534
00:32:35,890 --> 00:32:40,400
I've been thinking a lot about sort of
how certain Emoji can be a time capsule

535
00:32:40,401 --> 00:32:42,050
and then let themselves,
I mean,

536
00:32:42,080 --> 00:32:46,730
one of the things that I didn't cover
it all is while my emoji escapades were

537
00:32:46,731 --> 00:32:51,470
happening, a lot of other greater
cultural things are happening. You know,

538
00:32:51,500 --> 00:32:55,520
I had my realization moment and May,

539
00:32:55,520 --> 00:32:58,280
2017 and basically three
months later in August,

540
00:32:58,281 --> 00:33:02,390
Melania Trump tiptoed on her
stilettos to Hurricane Harvey,

541
00:33:02,690 --> 00:33:05,060
which set the whole media for roar.

542
00:33:05,300 --> 00:33:10,280
And then a month later you're the Harvey
Weinstein. Me Too. Thing happened. Um,

543
00:33:10,790 --> 00:33:14,960
which again, changed, change the
dialogue forever, I'd like to think.

544
00:33:14,961 --> 00:33:19,880
And then in January of 2018 you got
times up happening during the Oscars.

545
00:33:19,881 --> 00:33:21,050
So that was a year ago.

546
00:33:21,350 --> 00:33:25,190
And then in May you had the Cannes film
festival where literally Kirsten Stewart

547
00:33:25,191 --> 00:33:28,730
and the whole bunch of a actresses were
removing their shoes to walk the red

548
00:33:28,731 --> 00:33:32,690
carpet. Uh, and so I'd like
to think that, you know,

549
00:33:32,750 --> 00:33:36,670
30 years from now and my kids are still
seeing that little stiletto emote,

550
00:33:36,740 --> 00:33:41,540
that little flat shoe Emoji that they
can sort of pinpoint exactly what was

551
00:33:41,541 --> 00:33:45,080
happening on a broader cultural level.
Um,

552
00:33:45,140 --> 00:33:49,940
in the same group of the Emoji that mine
was released in is the mosquito Emoji,

553
00:33:50,150 --> 00:33:54,020
which to someone who doesn't
know the context of that
proposal, they might think,

554
00:33:54,350 --> 00:33:57,560
why do I need a mosquito Emoji?
But then when you drill down,

555
00:33:57,561 --> 00:34:01,300
you realize that it was proposed by
a team from the Johns Hopkins found

556
00:34:01,670 --> 00:34:05,060
infectology team and the bill
and Melinda Gates Foundation.

557
00:34:05,240 --> 00:34:09,020
And you suddenly realize that that
mosquito is there for the purpose of mass

558
00:34:09,080 --> 00:34:11,870
instant global communication.
And thinking about how,

559
00:34:12,140 --> 00:34:16,100
how do you communicate across countries
where maybe populations aren't literate

560
00:34:16,220 --> 00:34:19,370
but completely understand this
image of the mosquito thing,

561
00:34:19,430 --> 00:34:23,630
the vehicle by which diseases
transmitted. Um, again, I think, you know,

562
00:34:23,660 --> 00:34:27,350
in a way this brick Emoji and the
brick wall will immediately point to a

563
00:34:27,351 --> 00:34:31,610
specific moment in history,
um, and debate. And so,

564
00:34:32,030 --> 00:34:32,863
um,

565
00:34:33,020 --> 00:34:37,160
it's interesting to me that these
little images can actually point to

566
00:34:37,190 --> 00:34:40,070
historically significant moments.
If you know the backstory to them.

567
00:34:41,600 --> 00:34:44,780
One last question then we'll open
it up to everybody here in online.

568
00:34:45,350 --> 00:34:47,390
But from that perspective of history,

569
00:34:47,750 --> 00:34:52,490
there is a lot of criticism that the
Emoji library has gotten too large a and

570
00:34:52,491 --> 00:34:54,050
even on our team and android messages,

571
00:34:54,051 --> 00:34:57,960
we're thinking of new ways to let people
search and browse Emoji because it's,

572
00:34:57,961 --> 00:34:58,491
it's,
you know,

573
00:34:58,491 --> 00:35:03,491
it's gone from the original 400
over 2,700 and there's talk about,

574
00:35:04,310 --> 00:35:08,640
you know, should some Emoji
be retired or replaced? Um,

575
00:35:08,960 --> 00:35:12,230
from the perspective of history,
like what are your thoughts on that?

576
00:35:12,350 --> 00:35:14,000
Should Emoji be retired or,

577
00:35:14,690 --> 00:35:18,650
it's a tricky one because I can
see the unwieldiness argument,

578
00:35:19,340 --> 00:35:24,340
but I also am not one
to use that argument,

579
00:35:24,820 --> 00:35:25,640
um,

580
00:35:25,640 --> 00:35:30,640
to justify retiring some whenever they're
sort of quantity argument comes into

581
00:35:30,891 --> 00:35:34,460
play. I pointed to the fact that they're
like 13 phases of the moon Emoji.

582
00:35:35,080 --> 00:35:39,330
Do we need 13 of them? Probably not.
But then it becomes a point of view,

583
00:35:39,360 --> 00:35:42,570
decision making matrix. Um, and so I,

584
00:35:42,630 --> 00:35:44,920
I would hate to think that the,

585
00:35:45,130 --> 00:35:50,130
the minority voice or the quietest emoji
would get retired because it's usage or

586
00:35:51,570 --> 00:35:55,770
adoption rate is lower than, you
know, the twinning playboy bunnies.

587
00:35:55,830 --> 00:36:00,060
Um, so I think that's a
bigger question for the,

588
00:36:00,170 --> 00:36:04,050
the engineers in the room
to tackle. Um, but um,

589
00:36:04,560 --> 00:36:05,430
but you know,
like,

590
00:36:05,431 --> 00:36:08,460
I think there's some statistic that
by the time a kid is five years old,

591
00:36:08,461 --> 00:36:11,550
they've used and heard 40,000 words.

592
00:36:11,670 --> 00:36:15,300
So in the context of 2100 Emoji,
yes,

593
00:36:15,301 --> 00:36:17,940
it's a bit unwieldy to scroll
through and find the ones that,

594
00:36:18,200 --> 00:36:21,810
that are part of your daily vocabulary.
But we're Carter.

595
00:36:23,440 --> 00:36:28,230
That's great.
I'm going to grab this mic.

596
00:36:28,260 --> 00:36:32,880
How did you put it out there and how did
it start to go viral in the way that it

597
00:36:32,910 --> 00:36:33,743
ultimately did?

598
00:36:34,470 --> 00:36:39,470
So I came up with the idea
for the Emoji in May of 2017.

599
00:36:40,800 --> 00:36:45,800
I sat on it for a couple of days and then
while going to an event at the pop up

600
00:36:46,621 --> 00:36:48,900
magazine,
I'm in San Francisco,

601
00:36:49,200 --> 00:36:53,580
I floated at past a very close
friend who said, you should do it.

602
00:36:53,581 --> 00:36:58,320
You've got nothing to lose. And
I was like, okay. Um, and then I,

603
00:36:58,350 --> 00:37:01,980
because I thought, oh well, you know,
apple is the one that dictates Emoji.

604
00:37:02,190 --> 00:37:04,320
I turned to a friend of mine
who worked at apple and said,

605
00:37:04,321 --> 00:37:07,350
can you introduce me to someone on the
design team so they can talk to them

606
00:37:07,351 --> 00:37:10,350
about this stiletto? Um, and she was like,

607
00:37:10,351 --> 00:37:14,400
well actually apple doesn't determine
Emoji. The unicode consortium does.

608
00:37:14,790 --> 00:37:18,630
Um, and so that's when I taught
myself how to do the proposal.

609
00:37:19,260 --> 00:37:21,420
I submitted it without
really telling money.

610
00:37:21,421 --> 00:37:24,540
People that I did it was one of those
things like college applications,

611
00:37:24,541 --> 00:37:26,730
you don't really want to tell people
where you've applied cause you don't have

612
00:37:26,731 --> 00:37:29,700
to deal with like telling them
that you didn't get in. Um,

613
00:37:29,760 --> 00:37:33,540
and so there were a few close friends
who knew that I was going through the

614
00:37:33,541 --> 00:37:37,950
process. Um, when I got wind
that it was getting shortlisted,

615
00:37:38,160 --> 00:37:43,140
I decided to contact a friend of mine
who happened to have written a huge piece

616
00:37:43,141 --> 00:37:47,220
two years prior and the Atlantic and had
gone to college with me on Stilettos.

617
00:37:47,700 --> 00:37:50,100
And I called her up and I said,
I just want you to know,

618
00:37:50,101 --> 00:37:53,850
and going through this process, we don't
know whether it'll get accepted or not,

619
00:37:53,851 --> 00:37:55,830
but I thought, given that youth, you know,

620
00:37:55,920 --> 00:37:59,640
allocated this much ink to stilettos
in the past, you might find this funny.

621
00:38:00,270 --> 00:38:03,600
And she immediately got back to me and
was like, I want to write about this,

622
00:38:03,601 --> 00:38:07,470
can I, can I interview you?
And I said, sure, why not? Um,

623
00:38:07,471 --> 00:38:11,820
so that was in August. Um,
after the shortlisting.

624
00:38:12,120 --> 00:38:13,500
And we agree to time,

625
00:38:13,501 --> 00:38:17,670
the release of that article on the
Atlantic to the Friday before the unicode

626
00:38:17,671 --> 00:38:19,860
committee would be voting on the Monday.

627
00:38:20,520 --> 00:38:25,520
What I didn't expect is that between that
Friday morning and the Monday that New

628
00:38:26,430 --> 00:38:29,430
York magazine would basically
syndicate the Atlantic piece,

629
00:38:29,670 --> 00:38:33,180
that it would become the most read piece
for the next 36 hours on all of New

630
00:38:33,180 --> 00:38:35,740
York magazine's website
and most shared article.

631
00:38:35,980 --> 00:38:38,740
And that every single other outlet
would call me on the Monday morning.

632
00:38:38,800 --> 00:38:43,800
And so by the time the committee
met Monday afternoon to vote,

633
00:38:44,560 --> 00:38:45,520
they literally,

634
00:38:45,521 --> 00:38:49,360
I think probably felt like they had no
choice but to face the wrath of a million

635
00:38:49,361 --> 00:38:54,280
women suddenly felt this desperate
need to have a flat soled shoe Emoji,

636
00:38:54,490 --> 00:38:58,510
even though they'd never realized
until that moment its omission.

637
00:38:59,320 --> 00:39:03,220
And that's one of the sort of feedback
that I got also with the swimsuit Emoji

638
00:39:03,221 --> 00:39:07,600
when that sort of went out in the
public domain was I was speaking to a

639
00:39:07,601 --> 00:39:11,080
journalist at the times in
the UK and she said, you know,

640
00:39:11,081 --> 00:39:15,250
that the day after the chief fashion
critic of the New York Times or to huge

641
00:39:15,251 --> 00:39:17,860
piece about this swimsuit Emoji,
um,

642
00:39:18,250 --> 00:39:22,870
our entire editorial team got together
and said, how did we miss this?

643
00:39:23,250 --> 00:39:27,610
Like how did none of us realize
that the Bikini is the only one?

644
00:39:27,611 --> 00:39:31,930
And I think that's the thing where Emoji
can course correct and that you've got

645
00:39:31,931 --> 00:39:35,320
this incredible ability in
a fairly quick timeline.

646
00:39:35,321 --> 00:39:39,760
I mean 18 months from start to finish
to enrich this vocabulary. I mean,

647
00:39:39,970 --> 00:39:43,030
we're not talking about legislation which
can get bogged down through 20 years

648
00:39:43,031 --> 00:39:47,050
of bureaucracy. We're talking
about a world that, you know,

649
00:39:47,320 --> 00:39:50,890
it prides itself on its
agility to act fast. Um,

650
00:39:50,980 --> 00:39:55,110
so that was how he did it.
We pure PR,

651
00:39:55,120 --> 00:39:59,290
we bullied them into
thank you media,

652
00:39:59,780 --> 00:40:03,320
you run a very successful,
uh,

653
00:40:05,230 --> 00:40:09,830
yes. What are your thoughts
on the inconsistencies of
the depiction of the emojis

654
00:40:09,831 --> 00:40:13,360
admitted to Unicode on the various
platforms? Obviously like apple,

655
00:40:13,361 --> 00:40:18,250
Google and Facebook have all have
wildly different depictions of the shoe.

656
00:40:18,251 --> 00:40:22,570
Can you talk more about your,
your thoughts and what you'd recommend if,

657
00:40:22,600 --> 00:40:23,740
if you know,

658
00:40:23,741 --> 00:40:27,550
a fragmentation is a good thing or if
you'd prefer consistency in your next

659
00:40:27,551 --> 00:40:31,790
emoji submission. I hate the
fact that they're all different.

660
00:40:31,970 --> 00:40:33,040
To me it's,

661
00:40:33,130 --> 00:40:38,130
it's oxymoronic because Emoji are supposed
to be instantly recognizable between,

662
00:40:38,680 --> 00:40:39,950
you know,
all the platforms.

663
00:40:40,310 --> 00:40:44,820
I would love nothing more than to see it
consistently applied. Um, that's that.

664
00:40:44,900 --> 00:40:49,670
I recognize that platforms have a very
distinct visual and aesthetic language.

665
00:40:49,671 --> 00:40:51,170
And so,
you know,

666
00:40:51,410 --> 00:40:55,850
Google has its own sort of visual
language versus apple and it would,

667
00:40:56,150 --> 00:41:00,050
it would be ridiculous for me to expect
them to somehow coordinate across

668
00:41:00,051 --> 00:41:05,051
platforms and agree in the consensus
style format to one singular design.

669
00:41:05,720 --> 00:41:06,380
Um,

670
00:41:06,380 --> 00:41:10,940
I do think it's really funny to think
about how the design aspect is rolled out.

671
00:41:10,941 --> 00:41:13,760
I don't know if you've noticed,
say the jacket Emoji.

672
00:41:13,790 --> 00:41:16,850
I'm on apple platform low,

673
00:41:17,230 --> 00:41:19,550
eerily like a Burberry trench coat.

674
00:41:19,640 --> 00:41:22,940
And then you think about the fact that
Angela Ahrendts was the CEO of Burberry

675
00:41:22,941 --> 00:41:26,390
for over a decade and is now in charge
of merchandising and apple and you think,

676
00:41:26,930 --> 00:41:30,170
oh, okay, I get this,
you know, like, and so,

677
00:41:30,200 --> 00:41:34,070
but yet that jacket looks totally
different on apple Twitter.

678
00:41:34,070 --> 00:41:38,480
And so it kind of, to me the Fi's,
the very intent behind Emoji,

679
00:41:38,481 --> 00:41:43,481
which is I send my flat shoe to
someone in Chai Por who uses a Samsung.

680
00:41:44,961 --> 00:41:48,260
To me those should be the
same image as, um, but again,

681
00:41:48,261 --> 00:41:52,640
I think that's a coating and a brand
problem rather than an ideal world.

682
00:41:52,670 --> 00:41:53,503
It would be one

683
00:41:55,260 --> 00:41:58,040
I wanted to ask your opinion on.
Um,

684
00:41:58,260 --> 00:42:03,260
I've heard the argument that a emojis are
actually taking us back evolutionarily

685
00:42:03,871 --> 00:42:07,580
speaking linguistically
to hieroglyphics and um,

686
00:42:07,590 --> 00:42:12,390
that it's a reductionist form
of language and, um, actually,

687
00:42:12,660 --> 00:42:17,530
you know, the a word form
language is actually, um,

688
00:42:17,560 --> 00:42:21,840
a, allows us to communicate
more, um, more freely.

689
00:42:22,260 --> 00:42:25,120
Um, so I just didn't know.
Do you feel like, uh,

690
00:42:25,170 --> 00:42:29,650
there is a parallel between
hierarchy hieroglyphics? Absolutely.

691
00:42:29,651 --> 00:42:33,030
I think Emoji or just hieroglyphs 2.0,
um,

692
00:42:33,070 --> 00:42:35,830
in terms of pictorial language,
um,

693
00:42:35,980 --> 00:42:40,360
I think the main difference though is
obviously hieroglyphs were created before

694
00:42:40,600 --> 00:42:45,100
words existed in sort of the
traditional as we know it sense. Um,

695
00:42:45,520 --> 00:42:48,030
and I, I think in a way, um,

696
00:42:49,540 --> 00:42:53,200
if you look at that slide where they
literally translated Moby Dick into Emoji,

697
00:42:53,410 --> 00:42:58,180
no one is using Emoji in that
way. Um, whether I reduces, um,

698
00:42:58,300 --> 00:43:01,420
sort of vocabulary acquisition,
that's certainly a concern of mine.

699
00:43:01,421 --> 00:43:04,750
And they was actually a conversation I
had with the journalists from Newsweek

700
00:43:04,751 --> 00:43:08,980
who said, do you know of any
linguists or sort of, you know,

701
00:43:09,010 --> 00:43:13,000
language acquisition specialist
in childhood who could
talk to me about sort of

702
00:43:13,360 --> 00:43:18,190
the downside or the effects of Emoji on
young brains in zero to five because we

703
00:43:18,191 --> 00:43:22,450
learn 80% of what we're going to know
our whole life in that age group. Um,

704
00:43:22,540 --> 00:43:27,430
and I said, no, you know, it's, it's
such a nascent, an embryonic state,

705
00:43:27,431 --> 00:43:31,060
but no one has actually done
the research yet. Um, you know,

706
00:43:31,061 --> 00:43:36,061
I think about the fact that
for our generation screentime
is it going to be like

707
00:43:36,131 --> 00:43:39,490
tobacco, the generation before we're
all using it and thinking it's fine.

708
00:43:39,490 --> 00:43:40,660
Then 20 years from now,

709
00:43:40,810 --> 00:43:43,570
all of the studies and research is going
aren't going to come out and be like,

710
00:43:43,571 --> 00:43:44,560
how did you miss this?

711
00:43:44,561 --> 00:43:47,830
How did you not notice the nefarious
a factor of these things on you?

712
00:43:48,130 --> 00:43:52,270
And so I do wonder whether
children are children and 20,

713
00:43:52,271 --> 00:43:56,350
30 years time are going to get the results
from all those academic studies that

714
00:43:56,351 --> 00:43:57,820
show that Emoji,

715
00:43:57,821 --> 00:44:02,821
you said screentime literacy rates are
plummeting of I'm optimistic and I'd like

716
00:44:03,581 --> 00:44:06,520
to think of that. It's a won't. But um,

717
00:44:07,180 --> 00:44:08,710
but I'm not an academic in that field.

718
00:44:08,711 --> 00:44:10,930
I think it takes a sociologist
to figure that one out

719
00:44:11,830 --> 00:44:13,440
after the,
um,

720
00:44:13,990 --> 00:44:18,730
the swimsuit emojis or is there anything
else top of mind or anything else you

721
00:44:18,731 --> 00:44:21,240
plan to work on? Is this going
to become like a side career?

722
00:44:21,470 --> 00:44:24,600
I know now there are couple of
things that I've been searching.

723
00:44:24,620 --> 00:44:26,570
I've been sort of percolating in my head.

724
00:44:27,320 --> 00:44:31,770
One obvious one which I think would
be kind of a coding nightmare is that

725
00:44:31,771 --> 00:44:35,730
obviously the family
Emoji stop at two kids.

726
00:44:36,480 --> 00:44:39,210
And clearly I need more than that.
Um,

727
00:44:39,270 --> 00:44:43,170
so I love to see an Emoji that
has two parents with four kids,

728
00:44:43,620 --> 00:44:48,310
um, and maybe get, you know, large
families lobbying for it with, um,

729
00:44:48,360 --> 00:44:50,820
another one,
which again I think is reflective.

730
00:44:50,821 --> 00:44:55,650
My worldview is the play categories
completely missing. You know,

731
00:44:55,660 --> 00:44:58,170
there's, there aren't any
slides, there aren't any swings,

732
00:44:58,171 --> 00:45:03,171
there aren't any seesaws which are
very much part of my weekend existence.

733
00:45:03,810 --> 00:45:07,260
Um, and certainly, um,

734
00:45:07,380 --> 00:45:10,800
I've been thinking a lot about the
sort of natural disaster and natural

735
00:45:10,830 --> 00:45:13,340
catastrophe category,
um,

736
00:45:13,410 --> 00:45:17,200
which was sort of inspired by the
mosquito Emoji and that, you know,

737
00:45:17,220 --> 00:45:22,170
if we're going to use these little
images to communicate on a broad,

738
00:45:22,410 --> 00:45:26,070
massive, instantaneous, um, level,

739
00:45:26,370 --> 00:45:30,840
can't we use it to alert people, turn
earthquake alert people to our tornado,

740
00:45:30,841 --> 00:45:33,990
alert people to hurricane
and in one little image,

741
00:45:33,991 --> 00:45:37,290
get people evacuating quickly
rather than going through, you know,

742
00:45:37,320 --> 00:45:41,730
the amber alert system
for example. Um, it's, uh,

743
00:45:43,240 --> 00:45:45,540
it's, it's exciting. Um,

744
00:45:45,630 --> 00:45:50,090
but one of the things that does sort of
keep me up is this idea of emoji usage

745
00:45:50,100 --> 00:45:54,780
eventually being mined and used to
profile people. You know, like if,

746
00:45:55,080 --> 00:45:58,620
if you use the fist bump and
it's of a dark skin tone, um,

747
00:45:58,980 --> 00:46:03,980
will that register you in some capacity
at an agency and lump you into one box.

748
00:46:05,880 --> 00:46:06,570
Um,

749
00:46:06,570 --> 00:46:10,890
and so I think if I do another Emoji,

750
00:46:10,950 --> 00:46:15,600
it has to be important. Like to me,
the shoe Emoji was never about, oh,

751
00:46:15,601 --> 00:46:19,760
I just want to shoot moti. Um,
it was about everything else. Um,

752
00:46:20,130 --> 00:46:21,180
and I think,
um,

753
00:46:21,300 --> 00:46:25,880
it's easy to lose sight of that intent
if you don't know the backstory. But, um,

754
00:46:26,540 --> 00:46:29,160
I,
I say that,

755
00:46:29,161 --> 00:46:33,750
and yet I was on the Unicode page last
week and I noticed in the shortlisted

756
00:46:33,840 --> 00:46:38,670
list was an Emoji proposal for Fond Du,
which is someone who's half Swiss.

757
00:46:38,670 --> 00:46:40,350
They designed it with a little capital,

758
00:46:40,400 --> 00:46:45,090
which is a traditional sort of copper
orange pot handle with the two sticks.

759
00:46:45,480 --> 00:46:46,920
And I loved it.
You know,

760
00:46:46,921 --> 00:46:51,660
like the celebrity aspect is one of
the things I think that makes Emoji so

761
00:46:51,661 --> 00:46:54,330
attractive and fun. And I was like, yes,

762
00:46:54,331 --> 00:46:58,460
I hope that makes it because I want
that fallen to a Moochie. So, um,

763
00:46:58,980 --> 00:47:02,280
you need to balance the two.
And thank you very much.

764
00:47:02,310 --> 00:47:05,820
You're certainly welcome back here
anytime. I'd love to hear more.

765
00:47:05,821 --> 00:47:07,920
If there's a other
Emoji that get approved,

766
00:47:08,280 --> 00:47:11,190
we'll certainly be tracking them
as well. But thank you. Thank you.
