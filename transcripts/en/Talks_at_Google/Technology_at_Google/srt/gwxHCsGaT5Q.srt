1
00:00:09,710 --> 00:00:14,330
Hi everyone. Thank you. I'm very glad
to be here and it's a bit impressive.

2
00:00:14,540 --> 00:00:19,540
That's also very presence to be able to
share this experience that was very um,

3
00:00:21,070 --> 00:00:25,490
uh, a milestone in my life. First of all,

4
00:00:26,420 --> 00:00:29,750
we are in September,

5
00:00:29,750 --> 00:00:34,750
2016 and I'm working in the streets on
the pedestrian and the sidewalks and I

6
00:00:37,011 --> 00:00:38,900
won't like to cross the streets.

7
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:43,960
So I come close to something that looks
like a pedestrian crossing and at the

8
00:00:45,081 --> 00:00:50,081
exact moments I placed my foods and
the pavements a car or on blast through

9
00:00:52,080 --> 00:00:52,913
there,

10
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:58,000
I jumped back to come back to the works
as a cow first by just right in front of

11
00:00:59,391 --> 00:01:00,224
me.

12
00:01:00,770 --> 00:01:05,770
I look and guess my art is a bit stamping
loudly and I realize that I've been

13
00:01:08,150 --> 00:01:13,150
very close from a very important
accidents I haven't seen that's a,

14
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:19,190
there were a car coming by.
I hadn't seen that.

15
00:01:19,470 --> 00:01:22,820
It was not a total pedestrian crossing.
In fact,

16
00:01:22,821 --> 00:01:24,800
it was the middle of
the street intersection.

17
00:01:25,550 --> 00:01:30,550
And if I hadn't seen all of this is
because I was blind and it is a picture of

18
00:01:31,671 --> 00:01:35,540
me for one week in September,

19
00:01:35,540 --> 00:01:40,540
2016 and you would wonder maybe why
someone would glide blindfold inside

20
00:01:42,261 --> 00:01:44,520
himself.
Pretty sample.

21
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:49,610
I have a friend who is Brian
Charlie and she has an accident.

22
00:01:49,970 --> 00:01:54,140
Maybe you know, it should take the
train quite often, you know, there is

23
00:01:55,730 --> 00:01:59,270
sometimes a separation,
a gap between the train and the platform.

24
00:01:59,960 --> 00:02:04,250
And if you don't mind, you
could fell. You can fall into.

25
00:02:04,730 --> 00:02:07,680
And that's what happened.
She fell, Eh, it's a one,

26
00:02:07,681 --> 00:02:11,510
an RF meter deep. Uh, she's fine today.

27
00:02:11,660 --> 00:02:16,660
But at this moment it's very
moved me inside and I realize,

28
00:02:18,110 --> 00:02:22,160
okay, I know you were in the
robotic field for years. Uh,

29
00:02:22,220 --> 00:02:23,510
in the French liberty cap.

30
00:02:23,630 --> 00:02:28,630
We train robots and we teach
them how to avoid obstacles gap.

31
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:33,590
How could we do it for
robots and not for blind?

32
00:02:34,100 --> 00:02:38,510
It makes sense for me to try to transfer
a lot of a bit of technology that are

33
00:02:38,511 --> 00:02:42,860
using in autonomous cars to
try to apply it to human being.

34
00:02:43,700 --> 00:02:45,140
So that was the starting point.

35
00:02:45,170 --> 00:02:50,170
And I figured out that if I
want to solve kind of problem,

36
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:52,560
I actually understand it.
So the,

37
00:02:52,561 --> 00:02:57,561
the first abuse main that I found
was to try to live for one week,

38
00:02:58,640 --> 00:03:02,440
Brian. It's like a simulation and
experience of cross. It's nuts.

39
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:06,310
Truly what Brian Pr person
will experiments because it's,

40
00:03:06,670 --> 00:03:09,300
there are some factors that are uh,

41
00:03:09,340 --> 00:03:13,930
that occurs only after a weeks and
especially if you are blind from,

42
00:03:14,320 --> 00:03:15,153
from birth.

43
00:03:15,250 --> 00:03:19,690
But it was very interesting
and if you want to try it,

44
00:03:19,750 --> 00:03:24,750
I recommend you to try it for
only 20 minutes on 20 minutes.

45
00:03:24,940 --> 00:03:27,400
It's very,
very instructive.

46
00:03:27,580 --> 00:03:32,580
It was the worst week of my life
clearly and sort of a nightmare.

47
00:03:34,430 --> 00:03:35,680
Um,
unsure SPEC.

48
00:03:35,950 --> 00:03:40,950
And if I'm here today is to share you
three main discoveries I've made and three

49
00:03:41,141 --> 00:03:45,890
discoveries that drives me today
or in all of my projects, uh,

50
00:03:46,270 --> 00:03:49,780
including my startup.
First of all,

51
00:03:50,950 --> 00:03:55,330
I would like to
guide you through a journey.

52
00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:59,710
I will take this tool,
which is a white can.

53
00:04:02,830 --> 00:04:07,830
You will close your eyes and I will be
your guide to discover as treats in the,

54
00:04:11,080 --> 00:04:15,130
in the region, in the Paris area. So
close your eyes and listen to my voice.

55
00:04:17,830 --> 00:04:20,860
You are on the sidewalk.

56
00:04:21,790 --> 00:04:26,790
The wall from the building you would just
left is on your right and side on your

57
00:04:26,921 --> 00:04:29,140
left.
You know that there is a road.

58
00:04:29,980 --> 00:04:34,980
You all in your white Jen until the until
you're right and and you can feel the

59
00:04:35,741 --> 00:04:39,100
pavement under your feet.
It's summer,

60
00:04:40,090 --> 00:04:40,923
it's warm.

61
00:04:41,020 --> 00:04:45,880
You're wearing a tee shirt and a light
win is bringing you the sounds of a

62
00:04:45,881 --> 00:04:47,230
cafetiere Ross nearby.

63
00:04:48,460 --> 00:04:53,460
It's a pleasant sensation you
decide to move on as you're working.

64
00:04:54,700 --> 00:04:56,860
Your wife, Jen is doing. It's zigzag.

65
00:04:57,340 --> 00:05:01,900
Dan's head of you in order to
protect you from any obstacle.

66
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:08,520
It's taping on the ground and
on the world on a regular basis.

67
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:10,870
By doing this,

68
00:05:10,900 --> 00:05:15,490
you feel sure you can keep working
straightforward without veering off.

69
00:05:16,300 --> 00:05:18,040
Everything is perfect.

70
00:05:19,240 --> 00:05:23,680
Suddenly on your left ear
allowed roaring sound.

71
00:05:24,210 --> 00:05:27,190
A car probably just passed by on the road,

72
00:05:27,580 --> 00:05:31,390
so honestly the noise
was so defeat defunding.

73
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:34,830
You could have believe it was
driving right on the side work.

74
00:05:36,150 --> 00:05:36,983
You go and work it.

75
00:05:38,890 --> 00:05:42,880
You gain confidence and you
step away from the world.

76
00:05:42,970 --> 00:05:45,850
Just a little in order
to move more freely.

77
00:05:47,350 --> 00:05:51,910
When all of us students, you're
white Chen, it's something strongly

78
00:05:54,100 --> 00:05:57,530
you surprised taping on this on thing

79
00:05:59,420 --> 00:06:01,550
and then checking it with two hand.

80
00:06:03,110 --> 00:06:06,320
It feels like a big tree trench

81
00:06:08,630 --> 00:06:10,310
by being a bit more careful.

82
00:06:10,580 --> 00:06:13,640
You realize that you can
eat a little birds singing.

83
00:06:14,610 --> 00:06:19,390
They seem to have a lot of fun
right above your hand. Your ad,

84
00:06:19,960 --> 00:06:22,460
this is,
it validates your theory of the tree.

85
00:06:22,790 --> 00:06:27,530
You concluded that all of those nice
little birds must be playing on the

86
00:06:27,531 --> 00:06:32,460
branches, which probably belonged
to the trees that are on the side.

87
00:06:32,461 --> 00:06:33,590
Work on your left.

88
00:06:34,790 --> 00:06:39,710
You decide to get around the tree by
sticking to the middle of the sidewalk and

89
00:06:39,711 --> 00:06:44,420
you resume your journey.
Three steps, five steps.

90
00:06:46,640 --> 00:06:50,660
Oh, you can. It's something
again and this time

91
00:06:52,490 --> 00:06:56,030
it's a metal things.
The Sun is very sharp,

92
00:06:56,300 --> 00:06:58,700
almost Chris timing light.
It's some,

93
00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:02,690
it sounds like this thing
is something very light.

94
00:07:03,410 --> 00:07:07,670
You're tapping on it and oh
yes. Oh yes, I know. What is it?

95
00:07:07,940 --> 00:07:08,773
It's a chair.

96
00:07:09,770 --> 00:07:14,770
Your cane is stuck and you've gotten
cage into a characteristic of a cafe.

97
00:07:18,680 --> 00:07:23,480
You can open your eyes again.
How was it

98
00:07:25,700 --> 00:07:26,533
pleasant or not?

99
00:07:29,060 --> 00:07:33,870
This street is the street
just next to my home presence.

100
00:07:33,990 --> 00:07:34,823
Yeah,

101
00:07:36,440 --> 00:07:41,440
and I'd like to point to
point an interesting fact
in all of this description,

102
00:07:43,130 --> 00:07:44,930
maybe you notice it,
there is,

103
00:07:45,260 --> 00:07:49,820
there were no visual
element only sound smelling,

104
00:07:50,060 --> 00:07:54,410
temperature touching,
no, no visual elements.

105
00:07:54,650 --> 00:07:58,040
But I'm pretty sure everyone
here at the clear view,

106
00:07:58,041 --> 00:08:01,460
a clear representation of the
streets of what's happening.

107
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:03,073
Interesting now,

108
00:08:03,500 --> 00:08:08,500
interesting to notice that the brain is
able to create a mental representation

109
00:08:09,200 --> 00:08:11,420
of something you've never
been there somewhere.

110
00:08:11,420 --> 00:08:16,100
It never be on there and without
any education of how to build it.

111
00:08:17,030 --> 00:08:21,950
And that's the first discovery for me.
During this one week,

112
00:08:22,850 --> 00:08:27,850
I was first thinking that I would be
in the drug into darkness for one week,

113
00:08:28,340 --> 00:08:32,930
but in fact I wasn't. If you should close
your eyes for more than a few minutes,

114
00:08:33,530 --> 00:08:38,360
you realize that your brain starts to
put your memories in front of you and you

115
00:08:38,361 --> 00:08:43,361
start moving around literally into
your past and into what you know.

116
00:08:44,570 --> 00:08:49,570
So in every known areas I was able
to work through my memories was very

117
00:08:51,621 --> 00:08:52,454
surprising

118
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:57,210
but of course this also have limitations.

119
00:08:59,160 --> 00:09:02,340
When someone in,
for example in this room,

120
00:09:02,490 --> 00:09:07,260
if you move something or if you are
working on the sidewalk and the scooter is

121
00:09:07,261 --> 00:09:09,540
parked on the side work,

122
00:09:10,230 --> 00:09:15,230
the amount of representation and
the reality is not in sync and your

123
00:09:15,780 --> 00:09:19,290
visualization vanished so
you are not in the darkness.

124
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:25,560
My point is when I try to to
launch myself into new project,

125
00:09:27,150 --> 00:09:31,060
I think first hour now what are you
doing? You've never been there. You have,

126
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:34,110
you don't.
You can't give a talk in English,

127
00:09:34,380 --> 00:09:39,380
you're not good enough in English and
then I rethink and we thinking it's good

128
00:09:39,691 --> 00:09:44,010
because we all have more
resources inside of us.

129
00:09:44,370 --> 00:09:45,750
More that we tend to think

130
00:09:47,430 --> 00:09:50,850
and when our limitations are rich.

131
00:09:52,530 --> 00:09:53,071
For example,

132
00:09:53,071 --> 00:09:58,020
when my mental transition is
not quite sync with the reality,

133
00:09:58,260 --> 00:10:00,510
there is one option,
natural option,

134
00:10:01,380 --> 00:10:04,770
ask for help and it's a good
idea to ask for help. It,

135
00:10:04,771 --> 00:10:07,080
this is the second discovery I
would like to share with you.

136
00:10:08,430 --> 00:10:12,390
You know the Darwin theory, I
think it's quite known, well known.

137
00:10:14,190 --> 00:10:17,520
I think often it's a bit meaningless.
Misunderstood.

138
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:23,480
Darwin is about evolution and we often
think that evolution is a competition.

139
00:10:24,510 --> 00:10:26,670
The best pieces will evolve and survive,

140
00:10:27,240 --> 00:10:32,240
but in fact the kids who suck to success
is not competition is cooperation.

141
00:10:33,960 --> 00:10:38,960
Why our society is successful today is
because we have been able to cooperate,

142
00:10:39,420 --> 00:10:44,220
operate together and this is the
discovery I've made during this week.

143
00:10:45,180 --> 00:10:46,530
I was not alone.

144
00:10:47,130 --> 00:10:50,880
We're human being is capable
of an amazing capacity,

145
00:10:50,881 --> 00:10:54,360
capability of empathy and compassion.

146
00:10:58,320 --> 00:10:59,640
And I would like to share you

147
00:11:01,230 --> 00:11:05,250
a quartz from a colleague of
mine in Palatine. In my startup,

148
00:11:05,251 --> 00:11:08,530
we have a sort of tradition.
Every new colleague, I'm pretty,

149
00:11:08,710 --> 00:11:13,170
I have to live 24 hours blind
to, to feel it. What it is,

150
00:11:13,230 --> 00:11:18,000
it's not to mock is not to
to simulate anything more.

151
00:11:18,001 --> 00:11:18,834
That's okay.

152
00:11:18,960 --> 00:11:23,960
You join us and you have to to realize
deep inside you that we try to solve a

153
00:11:24,391 --> 00:11:27,540
human problem.
We are not building a tech tool.

154
00:11:27,570 --> 00:11:29,940
We are building something
that will help people.

155
00:11:30,750 --> 00:11:34,020
And after this 24 hour experience,

156
00:11:34,050 --> 00:11:36,150
it taught me this.

157
00:11:36,180 --> 00:11:40,030
There's 24 hours in the dark re candid,

158
00:11:40,170 --> 00:11:42,450
my face in human nature.

159
00:11:45,180 --> 00:11:46,013
Okay.

160
00:11:46,210 --> 00:11:51,160
We all have this um, situation. You are
in the mutual, in Paris on the morning,

161
00:11:52,090 --> 00:11:57,090
everyone with the head down looking at
the screen of the smart phones and we

162
00:11:59,260 --> 00:12:02,350
avoid eye contact the most as we can.

163
00:12:04,150 --> 00:12:07,360
And often we can wonder if
something very bad happened.

164
00:12:07,420 --> 00:12:11,500
Would someone raise up the Ed the
head to look at me and ask me?

165
00:12:12,670 --> 00:12:17,620
I can assure you that in a
distressful situation, every way,

166
00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:18,940
everything changes,

167
00:12:19,810 --> 00:12:24,810
everything changes and leave quite a lot
of distressful situations during this

168
00:12:25,240 --> 00:12:29,150
week into gives you a bit
of context. I leave, um,

169
00:12:29,530 --> 00:12:34,150
30 kilometer away from Paris,
about one hour and a half, uh,

170
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:35,553
to,

171
00:12:35,590 --> 00:12:40,590
to commute morning and in the nights and
during this week I would like to do a

172
00:12:41,621 --> 00:12:45,940
regular walks with
scheduling meetings in Paris,

173
00:12:45,970 --> 00:12:47,050
in everywhere.

174
00:12:48,190 --> 00:12:51,850
And of course I got lost a lot

175
00:12:53,680 --> 00:12:58,520
and one of this expensive, it's pretty,
pretty interesting. I was in the,

176
00:12:58,600 --> 00:13:03,600
in the station a lost and I was
very cushion with everything.

177
00:13:04,960 --> 00:13:09,720
When you're blind, you very caution
with everything you listen to. Uh,

178
00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:14,080
to paper on the fruit.
You listen two steps from Ozark persons,

179
00:13:14,350 --> 00:13:17,320
you are try to figure
out what's around you.

180
00:13:18,820 --> 00:13:22,150
I'm asking hello, is there, I
knew anybody or I need help.

181
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:27,010
And I uh, a young lady not far 10. Yes,

182
00:13:27,130 --> 00:13:27,963
I'm coming.

183
00:13:28,900 --> 00:13:33,550
She's coming to help me and she
does something very surprising.

184
00:13:34,900 --> 00:13:35,920
She thinks my end,

185
00:13:39,570 --> 00:13:40,710
well not the very tactile,

186
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:45,510
that team in our society don't free
do you have this situation where big

187
00:13:45,511 --> 00:13:49,520
elevator empty the drawers open,
man,

188
00:13:50,380 --> 00:13:55,350
step in and your works
cross to u s m stop ear.

189
00:13:56,010 --> 00:14:00,390
She was centimeter away from your face.
Did you have this acquired moments?

190
00:14:02,340 --> 00:14:07,260
And as I said in this twist for moments,
everything changes.

191
00:14:07,830 --> 00:14:10,770
When she took my end,
I was nuts.

192
00:14:12,630 --> 00:14:15,420
I was not, I was happy.
In fact, I was happy.

193
00:14:15,750 --> 00:14:20,750
It was very full of tenderness and I feel
like a wave of energy coming from Er.

194
00:14:23,550 --> 00:14:27,540
And I'm very glad because I recalled
this moment and would like to show you,

195
00:14:28,170 --> 00:14:30,360
I had the Gopro camera on the torso.

196
00:14:31,530 --> 00:14:36,000
So this is the station and
we can see the the girl.

197
00:14:36,090 --> 00:14:37,200
Yeah we've,
it's fun

198
00:14:39,490 --> 00:14:43,740
and I'm waiting and she took
my hand and in straight.

199
00:14:43,870 --> 00:14:48,300
Interesting is probably I
would in a regular situation,

200
00:14:48,490 --> 00:14:49,540
never talked to her.

201
00:14:50,680 --> 00:14:55,680
Also person she offers me ALP
naturally those guys very,

202
00:14:56,510 --> 00:14:58,590
very nice.
I was again lost

203
00:15:00,110 --> 00:15:02,270
and maybe we would never

204
00:15:04,670 --> 00:15:07,840
have course it's,
there were

205
00:15:12,050 --> 00:15:13,910
often people love about them.

206
00:15:13,911 --> 00:15:17,900
Self willing to help
me and a bit a quality.

207
00:15:17,901 --> 00:15:21,800
Trying to take my aunt to
move me often pushing me.

208
00:15:22,190 --> 00:15:23,030
Not a good idea

209
00:15:24,890 --> 00:15:28,910
but definitely people were very,
very nice to me.

210
00:15:29,420 --> 00:15:30,253
And it's,

211
00:15:30,560 --> 00:15:35,560
I think it's good to remember that human
being have a lot of good thing deep

212
00:15:36,141 --> 00:15:39,890
inside maybe in our
society. So bits, Hi Eden.

213
00:15:40,060 --> 00:15:42,290
And because we are all stressed,

214
00:15:42,560 --> 00:15:47,560
we are all in lack of time we go
fast but in distress for moments,

215
00:15:49,130 --> 00:15:51,950
it's good to know that we
can count on each other.

216
00:15:52,730 --> 00:15:56,300
And when I,
I know start a project,

217
00:15:57,050 --> 00:16:00,980
I often try to re to rethink
what are my capabilities.

218
00:16:01,550 --> 00:16:06,550
But I also try to think that in all
situation there will be someone ready to

219
00:16:07,061 --> 00:16:07,894
help.

220
00:16:08,630 --> 00:16:12,530
I think it's very relaxing in
important to get to keep it in line.

221
00:16:15,800 --> 00:16:17,570
And first,

222
00:16:17,960 --> 00:16:21,830
third one tell discovery is the most
important one and important one.

223
00:16:24,550 --> 00:16:28,990
A bit of background details.
When I jump into this week,

224
00:16:29,860 --> 00:16:32,530
I had clearly no idea
about what would happen.

225
00:16:33,550 --> 00:16:38,140
I had one or two hours of
training with the wide chain.

226
00:16:38,141 --> 00:16:41,680
We've with a friend of me
of my and then a jumping.

227
00:16:42,790 --> 00:16:47,620
But
after bumping into walls,

228
00:16:48,130 --> 00:16:52,780
bumping into and fire hydrants,
you know,

229
00:16:54,370 --> 00:16:58,900
you need 93 remembers
it. Uh, getting lost.

230
00:16:59,520 --> 00:17:03,910
I think the feeling of
being abandoned and yes,

231
00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:09,240
stepping into a dog poop
took the abuse with it.

232
00:17:10,030 --> 00:17:15,030
Smelling this disgusting smelling and
feeling the passengers reproached full

233
00:17:17,470 --> 00:17:22,470
look at me and finally being run over,

234
00:17:22,870 --> 00:17:27,700
nearly run over by a car.
I knew exactly what it would be.

235
00:17:27,701 --> 00:17:28,534
It was the first day

236
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:34,960
and trust me on the second
morning when I had to to go out,

237
00:17:35,620 --> 00:17:40,040
I was terrified. And even
today when I look at the, the,

238
00:17:40,050 --> 00:17:41,560
the recording from this week,

239
00:17:42,010 --> 00:17:46,150
I can feel my stomach because
it was very terrifying.

240
00:17:46,150 --> 00:17:50,670
I think it's kind of traumatic to do it.
So as I said,

241
00:17:50,700 --> 00:17:51,930
20 minutes,
not more,

242
00:17:52,230 --> 00:17:56,760
but that is said there is a powerful,

243
00:17:57,500 --> 00:18:02,500
powerful discovery bi in this
on the morning I take my shoes,

244
00:18:02,820 --> 00:18:04,980
I take the camera,
I closed the door.

245
00:18:04,981 --> 00:18:09,981
I think the inviter I go in front of
the drew of my building and then I was

246
00:18:11,370 --> 00:18:12,203
stuck.

247
00:18:12,420 --> 00:18:17,420
Petrified can do any more moved and I
don't know how much time does it take,

248
00:18:18,060 --> 00:18:23,060
but at certain points when I
opened the door and I step out,

249
00:18:23,460 --> 00:18:26,160
everything vanished.
I mean

250
00:18:27,900 --> 00:18:32,900
the fear tends to stop you to
stop me and when you jump out,

251
00:18:34,420 --> 00:18:39,060
when you jump, the FIA is still
here, but the power is vanished.

252
00:18:39,870 --> 00:18:44,870
That's why I like to say the first
step is always the more difficult one,

253
00:18:45,720 --> 00:18:50,070
but also the more important one.
And it runs for everything,

254
00:18:50,100 --> 00:18:54,720
I think projects but also
spots and everything.

255
00:18:58,930 --> 00:19:00,610
Immobility,
polarize.

256
00:19:01,240 --> 00:19:05,440
Whereas movements liberates action.

257
00:19:05,500 --> 00:19:08,050
Chicks out fear.
And that's good to know.

258
00:19:09,370 --> 00:19:12,520
I unfounded in panda or startup,
we have a motto,

259
00:19:13,030 --> 00:19:17,110
it's the French word salts,
which mean leap English or jump.

260
00:19:17,800 --> 00:19:21,190
And the first letter from from salt is s,

261
00:19:21,370 --> 00:19:25,210
which stands for sacrifice.
It's a strong word,

262
00:19:25,211 --> 00:19:30,130
but a first step.
The first leap is always a sacrifice,

263
00:19:30,280 --> 00:19:34,010
but it's what's cost to Jen and I was,

264
00:19:34,011 --> 00:19:38,260
I also like the motor from the
first RPA or military in French.

265
00:19:38,290 --> 00:19:41,590
It's a Kiehl's Gal.
[inaudible] win.

266
00:19:43,230 --> 00:19:44,090
This is it you,

267
00:19:44,200 --> 00:19:49,200
you'd ask you when you jump and
direction chicks funeral outs.

268
00:19:50,620 --> 00:19:54,340
So this is the point
I've been trying to make.

269
00:19:55,930 --> 00:19:57,700
We all have dreams.

270
00:19:59,860 --> 00:20:03,640
Maybe it's taking a trip around the world.
Start Your own business,

271
00:20:04,790 --> 00:20:08,410
take a new artistic ob,
take on a sprouting challenge,

272
00:20:08,650 --> 00:20:12,100
volunteer with an Ngo,
even going vegetarian,

273
00:20:14,650 --> 00:20:19,210
tested, whatever the challenge is.
I know, believe that this I have.

274
00:20:19,460 --> 00:20:24,460
If I think it's enough and it's come to
my mind quite often I have to rethink to

275
00:20:25,361 --> 00:20:28,210
stop and to rethink why
I am not acting on it.

276
00:20:28,930 --> 00:20:32,020
And if we are unnecessary,
if I am honest,

277
00:20:32,320 --> 00:20:36,070
always the reason why I don't move,
it's sphere only fear.

278
00:20:37,540 --> 00:20:40,990
That's why the first step, the first
step is for me, very important.

279
00:20:43,120 --> 00:20:45,490
The first step is always a sacrifice,

280
00:20:46,060 --> 00:20:50,500
but let's,
let's make a parent is ear about dreams.

281
00:20:51,550 --> 00:20:52,390
I like dreams.

282
00:20:53,380 --> 00:20:57,700
I think them quite seriously
and I know drink in France,

283
00:20:58,000 --> 00:20:59,050
a lot of persons.

284
00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:03,370
You remember some famous dream
Martin Luther King for example.

285
00:21:03,970 --> 00:21:07,210
A dream can influence a lot of people

286
00:21:08,920 --> 00:21:11,980
in dreams. Always funny. It's
fascinating, fascinating me.

287
00:21:13,540 --> 00:21:18,540
Maybe you have been called a dreamer in
the past I've been and I think there is

288
00:21:19,691 --> 00:21:23,290
a huge difference between
dreaming and planning.

289
00:21:24,010 --> 00:21:28,090
I can dream all of my life going for a
trip around the room and doing nothing.

290
00:21:28,690 --> 00:21:33,690
I can plan to go for a trip to trip
around the world and starting it by typing

291
00:21:35,081 --> 00:21:38,290
on Google how to go for
a trip around the world.

292
00:21:39,370 --> 00:21:42,610
The difference is that an
issue if I dream today,

293
00:21:42,820 --> 00:21:47,820
I tried to dream seriously with an of
power when the NF conviction passion to

294
00:21:50,141 --> 00:21:53,410
turn them into an PR,
into plans that we'll be able to,

295
00:21:55,050 --> 00:21:57,370
to inspire millions of people.

296
00:21:58,270 --> 00:22:02,500
I think that's the the most
wonderful thing with dreams.

297
00:22:04,450 --> 00:22:05,283
In conclusion,

298
00:22:07,230 --> 00:22:10,450
I embarked in this and virtual
without knowing what I was doing.

299
00:22:10,480 --> 00:22:12,700
Clary as far as a,

300
00:22:12,830 --> 00:22:17,410
not fun at the beginning but in fact
I've discovered a lot of our things on me

301
00:22:17,590 --> 00:22:22,590
and users and those three discoveries are
not driving me for all of the projects

302
00:22:23,410 --> 00:22:25,570
I can.
I can lead first.

303
00:22:26,680 --> 00:22:31,210
I have more resource in me and we all
have more resource in our that what re

304
00:22:31,211 --> 00:22:32,044
tends to think.

305
00:22:36,090 --> 00:22:40,890
This is one of my principal today and I
encourage you when you want to start a

306
00:22:40,891 --> 00:22:43,080
project to rethink about your capability.

307
00:22:43,230 --> 00:22:47,730
Often we can do more to
corporation is key to success.

308
00:22:48,330 --> 00:22:50,880
For me it's the most important discovery.

309
00:22:51,750 --> 00:22:56,580
We are not alone and we can choose
to be this helper for someone that is

310
00:22:56,820 --> 00:23:01,260
building something new that is
leading a project and I've decided to,

311
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:04,560
whenever I am,
wherever I do,

312
00:23:04,860 --> 00:23:09,860
whatever I do to be this and to help
someone that will maybe contact me and I

313
00:23:10,231 --> 00:23:14,670
knew that we'd be able to and some someone
else on the project. I have to learn.

314
00:23:14,840 --> 00:23:18,150
I had to lead
and self discovery.

315
00:23:18,780 --> 00:23:22,950
The first step is always the
most important one and the
most difficult one. Also.

316
00:23:23,500 --> 00:23:27,900
Um, I keep fighting against me
against procrastination, against,

317
00:23:28,490 --> 00:23:31,950
um, my tends to put off
my dream till tomorrow,

318
00:23:33,030 --> 00:23:38,030
but I take them very seriously and I
take all my efforts to convert my dream

319
00:23:38,760 --> 00:23:43,260
into plants and often
sometime it creates a startup.

320
00:23:44,960 --> 00:23:47,960
I'm convinced that some of us today

321
00:23:49,580 --> 00:23:53,900
we'll take that leap of faith that
will trigger a major discoveries,

322
00:23:54,530 --> 00:23:58,130
major initiative that we positively
impacted millions of people.

323
00:23:58,790 --> 00:24:03,790
So I would like to conclude with a quote
from Mr Chak noise that I'm sure you,

324
00:24:05,750 --> 00:24:09,920
you love
like me and you said

325
00:24:11,960 --> 00:24:14,690
there really is a hero in all of us.

326
00:24:15,410 --> 00:24:20,410
We've all been designed by God to be a
blessing to many an arrow to some bud.

327
00:24:22,101 --> 00:24:24,110
There is only one way to go there.

328
00:24:24,800 --> 00:24:29,800
Do I think we can choose to
be around starting today?

329
00:24:30,920 --> 00:24:31,753
Thank you.

330
00:24:37,830 --> 00:24:38,521
Yeah,
I left.

331
00:24:38,521 --> 00:24:43,210
So I like to have some questions about
the credits cause I can talk about your

332
00:24:43,211 --> 00:24:48,130
experience best support, inspiring.
That's what it would feel like.

333
00:24:48,131 --> 00:24:50,730
How he's bored. Okay. Up Cook meat.

334
00:24:51,890 --> 00:24:52,850
Yes.
Um,

335
00:24:53,270 --> 00:24:57,920
Bhanda is today to the sixth
iteration of the product.

336
00:24:58,520 --> 00:24:59,353
First of all,

337
00:24:59,450 --> 00:25:04,160
we were designing sort of new
class sort of gloves and you know,

338
00:25:04,161 --> 00:25:08,840
when you prototype something you'll
give it to someone and you say, okay,

339
00:25:08,841 --> 00:25:13,790
it's good. No, it's good, it's bad.
You just, it's just nice to you.

340
00:25:14,210 --> 00:25:19,210
And so we tried a lot and
now we are building uh,

341
00:25:19,510 --> 00:25:23,630
headsets which goes around the neck.
We have a little camera rotten.

342
00:25:23,670 --> 00:25:26,960
He came around my,
like a drone one in the side,

343
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:28,700
which is about to record.

344
00:25:29,360 --> 00:25:33,590
I'll take pictures of
Jennifer environments and to
explain it to the blind user.

345
00:25:34,630 --> 00:25:37,090
The idea is to,
um,

346
00:25:37,600 --> 00:25:42,290
two l per persons in walk areas,
scores,

347
00:25:42,950 --> 00:25:46,840
public transportations by reading signs,
uh,

348
00:25:47,030 --> 00:25:51,050
papers and two by identifying objects,
recovering them.

349
00:25:51,260 --> 00:25:53,840
If they fall under Ron of issue.
Dex Can,

350
00:25:53,841 --> 00:25:56,330
or I don't know how your
desk is clean or not,

351
00:25:56,331 --> 00:26:00,800
but you can then ask him on
that to find an item that you,

352
00:26:01,040 --> 00:26:01,873
that you have to take.

353
00:26:05,600 --> 00:26:10,130
But the idea behind it is,
this is Paula today.

354
00:26:10,940 --> 00:26:13,280
But my goal is not to create like this.

355
00:26:13,281 --> 00:26:16,310
My goal is to help people to,

356
00:26:16,910 --> 00:26:19,130
to regain their autonomy.

357
00:26:19,880 --> 00:26:24,050
Maybe tomorrow it will be something
totally different and I'm fine with it and

358
00:26:24,230 --> 00:26:29,230
hopefully one day will be useless
because if we do our walk a call,

359
00:26:30,200 --> 00:26:32,140
actually we will be able to,

360
00:26:32,330 --> 00:26:37,330
to teach person to leave without powder
because it's kind of a reeducation

361
00:26:38,660 --> 00:26:41,090
process. Yes. Great question.

362
00:26:41,170 --> 00:26:44,370
So I had never thought of it. When
you, it, it seems almost obvious

363
00:26:44,370 --> 00:26:47,640
to your self driving cars and it almost
seems obvious compliant people would

364
00:26:47,641 --> 00:26:50,970
have this and I know they don't cause I
don't know any blind person who has the

365
00:26:51,030 --> 00:26:52,770
similar technology to self driving car.

366
00:26:53,010 --> 00:26:57,090
Did you find other projects doing things
like this when you started or is it

367
00:26:57,360 --> 00:26:58,530
really just uh,

368
00:27:00,190 --> 00:27:01,100
yeah,
a few projects,

369
00:27:01,470 --> 00:27:06,470
most of them came from laboratories and
the goal is not to have a project behind

370
00:27:07,501 --> 00:27:09,850
just a demonstration of African Jew.

371
00:27:10,710 --> 00:27:15,710
The challenge is to adapt
what's the science says,

372
00:27:16,650 --> 00:27:21,650
what are the result of experiments
into an affordable products for a teeny

373
00:27:22,261 --> 00:27:25,670
market. And this challenge, uh,

374
00:27:26,400 --> 00:27:29,130
explains what the,
why the result,

375
00:27:29,910 --> 00:27:34,500
not that much project today and not
that much project, especially for kids.

376
00:27:35,010 --> 00:27:40,010
And what we know today is kids
is the key because the brain,

377
00:27:41,070 --> 00:27:45,810
how it's evolved, the kief phase
is between six to 10 years old.

378
00:27:46,360 --> 00:27:49,590
If you act on this particular
stage of development,

379
00:27:50,520 --> 00:27:54,000
you can take a giant leap
for the future of the person.

380
00:27:54,540 --> 00:27:59,010
And if you miss it or
if you try to act later,

381
00:27:59,670 --> 00:28:04,670
you will be on a sort of transactional
item and you will be dependent of the

382
00:28:05,191 --> 00:28:09,870
tool. And even if it's a good
tool, it's more to be autonomous.

383
00:28:10,740 --> 00:28:14,610
And our idea is to teach
people personnel to,

384
00:28:15,180 --> 00:28:18,270
to go to fishing without
giving fish all the time.

385
00:28:18,980 --> 00:28:22,320
Oh, do you think help you

386
00:28:24,580 --> 00:28:26,620
pursue that objective?

387
00:28:28,240 --> 00:28:31,390
You must know what our services,

388
00:28:32,040 --> 00:28:35,950
we have media that you will have also
many other projects about cloud or

389
00:28:37,870 --> 00:28:41,320
do you think we could do more
to help you to, to reach you on?

390
00:28:43,400 --> 00:28:47,800
I think one of the key points
is a technological, uh,

391
00:28:47,870 --> 00:28:52,870
artificial intelligence is one
of the center of conduct today.

392
00:28:54,050 --> 00:28:58,190
And we know that Google is doing a lot
of research in this field in particular

393
00:28:58,191 --> 00:29:01,700
in computer vision.
So that could be um,

394
00:29:01,760 --> 00:29:06,760
an important step in forward
if we were able to yes.

395
00:29:07,070 --> 00:29:12,070
To share resources we are using also
Google products and then of course there

396
00:29:13,401 --> 00:29:15,830
are are are always the um,

397
00:29:16,190 --> 00:29:20,560
the capability to generate trust around
you and especially true for a tech

398
00:29:20,600 --> 00:29:22,640
startup in this early stage.

399
00:29:23,970 --> 00:29:28,470
Do you think we keep
your users stuck into uh,

400
00:29:28,950 --> 00:29:33,950
like your product or already
helping them to uncover more sense

401
00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:38,540
and the surroundings?
Yes. This is the question.

402
00:29:39,770 --> 00:29:44,240
It's more like a, what do you add that
to your situation that being bled?

403
00:29:44,680 --> 00:29:48,640
There is a project that
he's here and helps you

404
00:29:50,380 --> 00:29:55,380
downloads of justification and explanation
needed to zip into this question.

405
00:29:55,391 --> 00:29:58,630
But few key points.
First,

406
00:29:59,500 --> 00:30:03,100
the brain is designed to use to,

407
00:30:03,430 --> 00:30:06,190
to use military stories.
At the same time,

408
00:30:06,660 --> 00:30:09,390
universities use only one issue.

409
00:30:09,400 --> 00:30:12,850
See you tends to ear issue
smell you send to local to,

410
00:30:12,851 --> 00:30:17,170
to find the location of the, the
smell always. It's a combination.

411
00:30:17,230 --> 00:30:20,410
And even for the proprioception,

412
00:30:21,400 --> 00:30:24,720
when you touch something with
your fit or rocks together.

413
00:30:24,730 --> 00:30:29,730
So you can't just replace one sense
by another because if you do so you,

414
00:30:32,330 --> 00:30:36,100
you are, um, action, the
brain natural working.

415
00:30:36,880 --> 00:30:41,880
So the idea is to work the same
way the brain is naturally working.

416
00:30:42,250 --> 00:30:45,750
And if you do so by
training a person on panda,

417
00:30:45,800 --> 00:30:50,080
you won't try needs for
natural situation also.

418
00:30:51,400 --> 00:30:53,190
And then the,

419
00:30:53,230 --> 00:30:58,230
the second idea is to show that what's,

420
00:30:58,980 --> 00:30:59,410
uh,

421
00:30:59,410 --> 00:31:04,410
the feedbacks that came that come from
GFI months and to help person to seem to

422
00:31:05,231 --> 00:31:09,700
be in control of the feedbacks that comes.
For example, panda is always sleeping.

423
00:31:10,600 --> 00:31:12,820
It's not proactive,
it's only reaction.

424
00:31:13,630 --> 00:31:17,950
So we have stimulation to help,
especially kids to move.

425
00:31:18,220 --> 00:31:23,220
But it's always the person that will
ask for information and process it.

426
00:31:24,130 --> 00:31:29,130
It's important and unimportant topic
that we have to address one day is this.

427
00:31:30,580 --> 00:31:31,300
Um,

428
00:31:31,300 --> 00:31:36,300
this issue with blind kids have not the
simulator the stimulation from the eyes.

429
00:31:36,640 --> 00:31:41,640
You see children doing a lot of mess
when they are a little because the

430
00:31:44,111 --> 00:31:48,660
experiments mater motorization
of their muscle, um, uh,

431
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:53,200
precision of the movement.
And this is called the,

432
00:31:53,260 --> 00:31:58,260
this is creating feedback loops between
the muscles and what you perceive of

433
00:31:58,691 --> 00:32:01,630
Shimmer. Sir, if you
don't see your movements,

434
00:32:02,590 --> 00:32:05,770
you lose a lot of
calibration of your own body.

435
00:32:07,060 --> 00:32:11,440
And this calibration is important
because it will help you to be more

436
00:32:11,441 --> 00:32:15,520
comfortable in the world, in your
move, in your social interaction.

437
00:32:16,840 --> 00:32:21,840
So one important thing we have to achieve
with powder is to try to recreate sort

438
00:32:22,361 --> 00:32:24,410
of artificial,
um,

439
00:32:24,520 --> 00:32:29,520
feedback loops that will add p person
to calibrate themselves and then have

440
00:32:31,811 --> 00:32:35,260
fully panda will be more and more,

441
00:32:35,500 --> 00:32:37,780
less and less useful.
Of course,

442
00:32:37,781 --> 00:32:41,420
there are a lot of things that you
won't be able to, to do reading,

443
00:32:41,480 --> 00:32:46,460
especially I don't see fighting, uh,
faces when they are far from you.

444
00:32:47,570 --> 00:32:52,520
But for the war majority of movements,
the idea is to motivates person,

445
00:32:52,880 --> 00:32:57,710
giving it side give, give
them, um, success. Also 12,

446
00:32:57,711 --> 00:33:01,880
10 through to go forward throw photo.
And by the way,

447
00:33:01,881 --> 00:33:06,881
that's why we're working with Ubisoft
on this topic to create a sort of video

448
00:33:07,281 --> 00:33:11,390
game experience, but not to do
again, but experience of, um,

449
00:33:13,190 --> 00:33:16,580
of winning,
getting success in the real,

450
00:33:16,640 --> 00:33:19,880
in a virtual environment to
then translate to reality.

451
00:33:23,190 --> 00:33:24,023
Long answer,

452
00:33:27,970 --> 00:33:32,770
one question from doing that week
that you were buying, were you,

453
00:33:32,830 --> 00:33:33,730
did you,
uh,

454
00:33:34,150 --> 00:33:39,150
I'm sure you've identified a lot of
problems that are not technology problems

455
00:33:40,061 --> 00:33:43,660
that can be sold somewhere else. Like,
like for instance, if I'm buying at night,

456
00:33:44,290 --> 00:33:47,880
I'm in a metro station, I have no
idea. Like where's the exit? Right.

457
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:51,950
What other things did you, um, from
all of those problems that you address,

458
00:33:51,951 --> 00:33:53,550
did you,
I dunno,

459
00:33:53,680 --> 00:33:58,540
contact areas to try to solve
any of those or did you have any

460
00:33:59,460 --> 00:34:01,080
yes, Donald Otoc of, uh,

461
00:34:01,200 --> 00:34:06,200
projects in the public public
area and pubic companies.

462
00:34:06,740 --> 00:34:10,050
Um, a lot of initiative. I think the,

463
00:34:11,310 --> 00:34:14,710
the goal would be to synchronize,
synchronize everyone. Two guys are,

464
00:34:15,240 --> 00:34:19,260
and this is happening
monthly,

465
00:34:19,530 --> 00:34:24,420
we've sought of federations of nonprofit
organization with a sort of cluster

466
00:34:24,421 --> 00:34:26,550
between companies,
between startups.

467
00:34:26,850 --> 00:34:31,850
And there is also a big motivation from
biggest companies due to low constraints

468
00:34:35,190 --> 00:34:36,960
and you two are so um,

469
00:34:37,110 --> 00:34:41,910
what's is called the responsibility of
the companies for the wellbeing for the,

470
00:34:42,480 --> 00:34:46,110
for the implication.
So I think it's going to do good,

471
00:34:46,170 --> 00:34:51,170
do good direction and I won't
solve all the program by myself,

472
00:34:52,530 --> 00:34:57,180
but like in robotics, in robotics,
some people think we will,

473
00:34:57,181 --> 00:35:02,181
I have autonomous
humanoid robots from one,

474
00:35:02,850 --> 00:35:07,290
one metro from my side for example.
I don't believe in it. I am,

475
00:35:07,650 --> 00:35:10,830
I think we will,
I have a lot of senior robots,

476
00:35:11,160 --> 00:35:16,160
very specific specific shit and dedicated
to the mission I dream for in men.

477
00:35:17,550 --> 00:35:19,590
We drove out like in the movies,

478
00:35:19,620 --> 00:35:24,620
but I think it's more efficient to
have tennis specialized workers.

479
00:35:25,830 --> 00:35:29,580
And it's the same way.
Found this problem of a visual impairment.

480
00:35:30,390 --> 00:35:33,620
Can't remember where it was. I read
an article a long time ago, uh,

481
00:35:34,010 --> 00:35:38,070
a blind person who could, we'd ride
a bike, think he might be American.

482
00:35:38,120 --> 00:35:41,790
Yes. You know about this. I'm
curious if you know anything.

483
00:35:41,791 --> 00:35:44,640
Cause I remember there were some theories
in the article that maybe because his

484
00:35:44,641 --> 00:35:47,640
parents and he said,
just go ride a bike.

485
00:35:47,670 --> 00:35:50,730
They didn't credit doing things even
though maybe it's a little bit dangerous.

486
00:35:50,910 --> 00:35:51,511
Their attitude was,

487
00:35:51,511 --> 00:35:54,840
well all kids do things that are a little
bit dangerous and maybe this was part

488
00:35:54,841 --> 00:35:59,070
of his ability to do all these things. Do
you, have you found anything about that,

489
00:35:59,071 --> 00:36:02,960
that maybe doing more
things somehow affects,

490
00:36:03,950 --> 00:36:07,090
I think I'm not the most qualified to,

491
00:36:07,470 --> 00:36:12,230
to know what seems to, to teach
a kid, especially a blind one.

492
00:36:12,620 --> 00:36:17,480
But, um, there is no general generic
change are always different cases.

493
00:36:17,870 --> 00:36:19,370
And I'm a friend,

494
00:36:20,120 --> 00:36:25,120
I've been friends with a blind person
and he's blind fro from his childhood and

495
00:36:25,191 --> 00:36:28,640
he's able to, to do the
echolocation. So you,

496
00:36:29,240 --> 00:36:33,790
you clicked your aunts or you make
some with your mouth and you can, uh,

497
00:36:34,010 --> 00:36:37,220
estimate the distances, the, the area,

498
00:36:37,250 --> 00:36:42,230
when we go into a room, it takes
an insane telling me, okay,

499
00:36:42,231 --> 00:36:46,340
there is no one here.
It's about a 20 meters square.

500
00:36:48,080 --> 00:36:50,620
It's very strong.
And is also um,

501
00:36:50,970 --> 00:36:55,440
a flight period plane that he said,
uh,

502
00:36:55,730 --> 00:36:57,900
I think we can do more to,

503
00:36:58,220 --> 00:37:01,490
to help kids to,

504
00:37:03,100 --> 00:37:04,970
to use their own abilities differently.

505
00:37:08,210 --> 00:37:12,120
Parents,
yes,

506
00:37:15,680 --> 00:37:20,090
but he tried to challenging and especially
again because they are not so many

507
00:37:20,630 --> 00:37:23,660
and that's a good and bad news because uh,

508
00:37:23,690 --> 00:37:26,540
you can't mass projects
something it really,

509
00:37:26,560 --> 00:37:31,560
Cruz also could cost a lot but there
is a real need that that's that's the

510
00:37:34,521 --> 00:37:35,720
opposite side.

511
00:37:45,040 --> 00:37:48,090
Yes.
That's something that you can do.

512
00:37:48,450 --> 00:37:51,270
We've just scratched the surface.
But do you go,

513
00:37:51,280 --> 00:37:56,280
this is nuts to especially do face
recognition because you have the voice and

514
00:37:57,450 --> 00:38:02,400
the person doesn't need to have explicitly
the name of the person she's talking

515
00:38:02,401 --> 00:38:07,401
about is talking about but some
situations are a bit awkward.

516
00:38:08,520 --> 00:38:09,031
For example,

517
00:38:09,031 --> 00:38:14,031
you are in a a cafe coffee machine with
other people and one by one they leave

518
00:38:18,780 --> 00:38:21,210
and you,
you know,

519
00:38:21,211 --> 00:38:26,211
alone annual continued talking alone and
it's quiet quite a common situation in

520
00:38:28,051 --> 00:38:28,884
companies.

521
00:38:29,190 --> 00:38:34,170
It's a bit shaming for the
person and we can fix it.

522
00:38:35,680 --> 00:38:40,300
Exactly. I don't see fine person,
but we can only say, okay,

523
00:38:40,301 --> 00:38:44,560
there were three people then through
and then no one and I can still hear the

524
00:38:44,561 --> 00:38:45,760
voice of my users.

525
00:38:45,761 --> 00:38:49,750
So I will input a teeny vibration to okay,

526
00:38:49,780 --> 00:38:51,490
check the reason why in front of you.

527
00:38:57,610 --> 00:38:58,443
Yes.

528
00:39:02,870 --> 00:39:05,070
Yes,
exactly.

529
00:39:07,250 --> 00:39:09,240
With your,

530
00:39:15,450 --> 00:39:19,920
from my weekend sprints. Okay. Yes.

531
00:39:20,700 --> 00:39:25,700
The remapping of the brain is something
that could occur very strongly only for

532
00:39:26,880 --> 00:39:29,060
the kids if,
sure.

533
00:39:29,280 --> 00:39:33,860
Child blind injured child
when you are adults. Um,

534
00:39:34,440 --> 00:39:36,450
there isn't,
it's not that strong.

535
00:39:37,020 --> 00:39:40,920
It's more something anecdotic but in fact,

536
00:39:40,950 --> 00:39:44,310
indeed for the kids it's very
important. And I have, uh,

537
00:39:44,340 --> 00:39:47,490
I know a software developer
who is blind and deaf.

538
00:39:48,420 --> 00:39:53,420
You have the both and Isabel to read
two lines of a book at the same time and

539
00:39:57,050 --> 00:40:01,730
understand the same amount
because he is a bit listen to you

540
00:40:03,240 --> 00:40:06,900
because the, the is
blind for, for the birth.

541
00:40:06,960 --> 00:40:09,600
And so he's about to do,
Brian is remapping.

542
00:40:09,960 --> 00:40:14,960
But on the other side there is a lot of
damages on the appropriate section and

543
00:40:18,091 --> 00:40:22,980
what we call a sensors calibration.
For example, if you have,

544
00:40:23,210 --> 00:40:27,480
um,
speakers all around you and I can,

545
00:40:27,540 --> 00:40:32,540
I will move a sound or injection and
we'll ask you to raise your hand when the

546
00:40:33,630 --> 00:40:36,480
sound is moving.
For a blind person,

547
00:40:37,170 --> 00:40:39,570
the gap is more,
is more important.

548
00:40:39,571 --> 00:40:43,950
Jangle of detection is more
important than for a sighted person.

549
00:40:44,820 --> 00:40:49,820
That's something that you can compensate
and reeducate and it's important to

550
00:40:50,800 --> 00:40:52,440
reeducate and don't.

551
00:40:53,010 --> 00:40:56,260
I were thinking that the remapping
of their brain was a great,

552
00:40:56,880 --> 00:41:01,080
like a Soviet power,
but in fact it's like of

553
00:41:03,120 --> 00:41:06,660
mitigate, mitigate. I
don't know to say that.

554
00:41:07,900 --> 00:41:12,750
Okay. Yes. Does it answer?

555
00:41:13,820 --> 00:41:15,770
Okay. Thank you. Thank you very much.

556
00:41:16,740 --> 00:41:18,210
Yes,
thank you very much.
