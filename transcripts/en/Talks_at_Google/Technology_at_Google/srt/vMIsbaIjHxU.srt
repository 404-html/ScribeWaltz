1
00:00:06,290 --> 00:00:10,970
And we are very excited to host here
today at all for authors of the book.

2
00:00:11,030 --> 00:00:15,680
Second Shift,
the inside story of the keep g m movement.

3
00:00:16,220 --> 00:00:17,330
So a few words about the book.

4
00:00:17,331 --> 00:00:21,590
First before I introduce
you to the authors who are
very kindly joined us today,

5
00:00:21,950 --> 00:00:25,700
add to take us through the book and
to take your questions and answers the

6
00:00:25,701 --> 00:00:29,030
second half of the session.
So the book details,

7
00:00:29,090 --> 00:00:33,590
the complexities of an automotive industry
rapidly transforming due to external

8
00:00:33,591 --> 00:00:38,591
economic and market forces at community
reliant upon a local manufacturing

9
00:00:39,231 --> 00:00:43,650
facility schedules to be added to
a long list of plant shutdowns,

10
00:00:44,300 --> 00:00:49,120
a variety of factions and personalities
at odds with the city of Lansing and

11
00:00:49,121 --> 00:00:53,870
[inaudible] committed to persuading
GM to reverse course on its decision.

12
00:00:54,590 --> 00:00:55,221
So a really,

13
00:00:55,221 --> 00:00:59,390
really great topic for us to discuss
today and we are delighted that the four

14
00:00:59,391 --> 00:01:01,990
authors of the book at can join us.
Um,

15
00:01:01,991 --> 00:01:06,110
so I'm going to introduce you
now to each of them. Um, David.

16
00:01:06,150 --> 00:01:10,420
Hello David. Um, he was
the mayor of Lansing. Uh,

17
00:01:10,430 --> 00:01:15,430
you're in Michigan from a 1994 to 2003
and you'll hear a lot more about David's

18
00:01:15,861 --> 00:01:20,810
role. And as we go through the
presentation, a retired person, ray,

19
00:01:21,830 --> 00:01:25,160
a former president and CEO of [inaudible],

20
00:01:25,550 --> 00:01:30,550
a Michigan based architectural and an
engineering firm working closely with Mary

21
00:01:30,650 --> 00:01:34,430
David Hollister on the keep GM campaigns
for the last ingredient Michigan

22
00:01:34,431 --> 00:01:39,431
community and raise served as the senior
strategic and marketing advisor to

23
00:01:39,891 --> 00:01:44,000
marry David Hollister during
his time at David close,

24
00:01:45,800 --> 00:01:47,090
correctly pronounced yes,

25
00:01:48,050 --> 00:01:52,100
professor McConnell endowed chair and
the chair person of the Department of

26
00:01:52,100 --> 00:01:56,900
Supply chain management in the Eli Broad
College of business at Michigan State

27
00:01:56,901 --> 00:02:01,300
University. And then Thomas Cole, um,

28
00:02:01,400 --> 00:02:06,400
professor of Byington and endowed a
chair and director of the International

29
00:02:07,430 --> 00:02:10,100
Business Center in the Eli Broad
College of business at Michigan State

30
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:14,300
University also.
And then finally Terry on the end here.

31
00:02:14,530 --> 00:02:19,490
I'm executive producer of a company
called message maker who prepared the

32
00:02:19,491 --> 00:02:23,360
documentary on the, on this great
story. So without further ado,

33
00:02:23,361 --> 00:02:25,220
I'm going to hand you over to Thomas.

34
00:02:25,221 --> 00:02:28,820
You're going to lead us through the
details of the book and then we'll be back

35
00:02:28,821 --> 00:02:32,180
in 30 minutes or so to take your
questions and answers. Thank you.

36
00:02:35,640 --> 00:02:39,410
[inaudible].

37
00:02:40,880 --> 00:02:44,370
All right. We're going to do a little
bit of the David clothes in particular,

38
00:02:44,371 --> 00:02:47,370
but also myself, we're very big
into supply chain management.

39
00:02:47,371 --> 00:02:50,700
The Michigan State University is known
for that. We're going to try to do some,

40
00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:54,210
uh, play with some logistical
challenges at the weave together.

41
00:02:54,211 --> 00:02:55,710
This story if you will for you.

42
00:02:56,370 --> 00:03:00,040
We're going to try to do it pretty
rapidly including a couple of clips,

43
00:03:00,041 --> 00:03:03,910
but the logistics comes in because I'm
going to hand the mic back and forth to

44
00:03:04,450 --> 00:03:07,000
the coauthor says well on
different segment topics.

45
00:03:07,001 --> 00:03:11,770
So hopefully that becomes engaging and
hopefully we stopped talking soon enough

46
00:03:11,771 --> 00:03:15,980
so that you guys can engage us with
questions as well. So second shift,

47
00:03:16,160 --> 00:03:17,450
you see the book cover,
uh,

48
00:03:17,590 --> 00:03:21,490
there's a documentary film that Terry
Terry and his team at message makers

49
00:03:21,491 --> 00:03:24,730
should put together as well.
There's a 55 minute documentary.

50
00:03:24,731 --> 00:03:28,330
It's been shown on PBS.
Detroit will be shown a nationwide,

51
00:03:28,331 --> 00:03:31,120
we think this fall or,
or soon thereafter.

52
00:03:31,450 --> 00:03:34,900
So there's a little bit of a branding
package there to talk about this

53
00:03:34,901 --> 00:03:39,580
particular story. So Mayor
Hollister came into office in 1994,

54
00:03:39,581 --> 00:03:40,780
if I remember it correctly,

55
00:03:40,781 --> 00:03:45,781
and this story started in 1996 and then
we take it from there actually up until

56
00:03:45,881 --> 00:03:49,750
last month, if you will. Uh, because
the GM and part of the world,

57
00:03:49,751 --> 00:03:54,240
this is very fascinating. Uh, so
book cover to go back to that,

58
00:03:54,241 --> 00:03:58,470
it's just a little bit of the scenery
and Lansing, we don't play it off march,

59
00:03:58,480 --> 00:04:02,780
but it's the senior and the landscape a
little bit, uh, uh, city line in Lansing.

60
00:04:04,150 --> 00:04:08,950
So the story goes back to something
to the tune of their 78 general motors

61
00:04:08,951 --> 00:04:10,450
assembly plants worldwide.

62
00:04:10,451 --> 00:04:15,310
Right now they're 18 as assembly plants
in the United States. And an interesting,

63
00:04:15,320 --> 00:04:19,150
we have two of them in Lansing and
we've had a car manufacturer and their,

64
00:04:19,151 --> 00:04:21,910
since technically 1897
with the old motor works,

65
00:04:21,911 --> 00:04:25,390
really started production
in 1901. But then, uh,

66
00:04:26,110 --> 00:04:30,850
we kind of reopened that would rate tag
nigger Chans help and others in 2001,

67
00:04:30,851 --> 00:04:34,630
the old plant that became kind of a newer
plant and newest at the time and then

68
00:04:34,631 --> 00:04:38,890
Delta Assembly became the second
one that opening Lansing in 2006.

69
00:04:38,891 --> 00:04:41,110
So it's been going on forever and ever.

70
00:04:41,111 --> 00:04:45,760
So the keep GM campaign had lots of
obviously with the mayor and others,

71
00:04:45,761 --> 00:04:50,761
lots of political connotations to it
that did the community one GMA Lansing or

72
00:04:50,821 --> 00:04:55,210
it didn't matter that we lost uh, uh,
those number of employees or other things.

73
00:04:55,211 --> 00:04:58,990
And the storyline is pretty
powerful. Uh, and I don't know,

74
00:04:58,991 --> 00:05:00,430
we can look at a lot of different numbers,

75
00:05:00,431 --> 00:05:04,870
but the numbers we like looking at are
there roughly 7,000 GM employees at the

76
00:05:04,871 --> 00:05:07,840
two plans a little bit shorter that,
that the two plants in Lansing,

77
00:05:08,050 --> 00:05:10,030
there's a 10 to one multiplier effect,

78
00:05:10,120 --> 00:05:13,630
meaning that for every one General
Motors employee in Lansing,

79
00:05:13,810 --> 00:05:18,810
there 20,000 more employees in the Tri
County area around where we are that

80
00:05:18,851 --> 00:05:23,710
serve Lansing. And there are another
50,000 employees and other companies.

81
00:05:23,711 --> 00:05:27,880
So there's 70,000 people at different
companies that support the two plants in

82
00:05:27,881 --> 00:05:31,690
Lansing. So you've got 70,000
of them, 7,000 of GM employees,

83
00:05:31,900 --> 00:05:32,940
and then it goes uh,

84
00:05:33,220 --> 00:05:38,220
almost crazy from their GM in Lansing
has 2,700 tier one suppliers and over

85
00:05:38,711 --> 00:05:43,270
50,000 tier two suppliers gets a little
bit technical and the terminology,

86
00:05:43,271 --> 00:05:47,980
but there's a lot of infrastructure that
depend on this particular set up that

87
00:05:47,981 --> 00:05:51,280
may or Hollister was able
to frankly save for Lansing.

88
00:05:51,281 --> 00:05:54,910
And obviously we have other communities
in Michigan that we can talk about if we

89
00:05:54,911 --> 00:05:58,820
can talk about what it meant, not tab
these plants there. So lots of numbers,

90
00:05:58,821 --> 00:06:01,160
lots of fun stories and
hopefully we can get into it.

91
00:06:01,161 --> 00:06:04,280
So the mayor was elected in 1993,

92
00:06:04,281 --> 00:06:08,060
came into office on January 1st
that's a weird date, the start mayor,

93
00:06:08,061 --> 00:06:13,061
but January 1st of 1994 and two years
after he got this knock on the door and

94
00:06:14,871 --> 00:06:16,220
he'll explain that a little bit.

95
00:06:16,220 --> 00:06:19,820
We're going to let them dwell on it after
I sort of set up the stage for where

96
00:06:19,821 --> 00:06:23,630
we're going with a storyline. A, but
that's his lovely wife Chris as well.

97
00:06:23,631 --> 00:06:26,870
And they're happy and Smiley on the
little bit in order to years later,

98
00:06:26,871 --> 00:06:30,530
we're just going to trash our commune
if basically that was the knock on the

99
00:06:30,531 --> 00:06:32,370
door he got done and gee,

100
00:06:32,380 --> 00:06:35,090
I'm not only did they say
that they were going to leave,

101
00:06:35,130 --> 00:06:38,510
there were some good stuff there too.
And we'll get into that too. But, uh,

102
00:06:38,630 --> 00:06:40,100
not only where they're going to leave,

103
00:06:40,250 --> 00:06:42,980
the mayor wasn't allowed to
tell anybody publicly anywhere.

104
00:06:43,010 --> 00:06:47,780
That was kind of what GM walked into
his office with literally. All right,

105
00:06:47,781 --> 00:06:51,170
so you sitting here contemplating
what happens and the add,

106
00:06:51,171 --> 00:06:53,030
Donovan is the knock on the door.

107
00:06:53,031 --> 00:06:56,350
We actually talk about and put
it in quotes are as well. Uh,

108
00:06:56,390 --> 00:06:58,400
and that happened very early.

109
00:06:58,700 --> 00:07:02,930
Now Mayor Hollister has been
in the legislature for 20
some years and worked in

110
00:07:02,931 --> 00:07:07,790
politics for a lot of, a lot
of years, even after it was
may or you worked in, uh,

111
00:07:07,820 --> 00:07:11,630
back in, uh, Governor Granholm
regime, if you will in Michigan.

112
00:07:11,990 --> 00:07:14,920
But this is a pretty big task to take on,
uh,

113
00:07:15,260 --> 00:07:16,940
when you have lots of different parties.

114
00:07:17,040 --> 00:07:20,870
40 through the tune of 40 signed on
to actually partner with the mayor.

115
00:07:21,310 --> 00:07:24,920
In this particular case, we have
a couple of clips. This is a clip,

116
00:07:24,980 --> 00:07:26,240
Terry Terry's team up.

117
00:07:26,241 --> 00:07:31,220
Message makers were the producers of
the documentary and this is the trailer

118
00:07:31,221 --> 00:07:32,480
that they produced as well.

119
00:07:32,481 --> 00:07:36,680
And it sort of captures all of the
things that I said then sets us up and

120
00:07:36,681 --> 00:07:40,610
scoping out where we're going with this.
So let's take a little bit of a look.

121
00:07:43,480 --> 00:07:46,390
This is always the general motors towel.
Always an Oldsmobile town,

122
00:07:46,660 --> 00:07:51,340
got elected in [inaudible] 93 I get
a knock on my door one day from vice

123
00:07:51,341 --> 00:07:54,820
president. General Motors said, we got
some good news and I got some bad news.

124
00:07:55,210 --> 00:07:59,660
We're going to be launching this
100 year birthday of my pill.

125
00:08:00,370 --> 00:08:05,370
But when this mine of product and we
don't have any new product from Lansing,

126
00:08:06,840 --> 00:08:11,770
all of a sudden thousands of manufacturing
jobs were at risk. Where do you start?

127
00:08:12,100 --> 00:08:14,140
There were people who said,
you know,

128
00:08:14,200 --> 00:08:18,520
we're not willing to give everything
to cheat in order to keep them.

129
00:08:18,880 --> 00:08:22,720
And they said publicly, well,
if GM leaves us oil production,

130
00:08:23,230 --> 00:08:24,160
it's no big deal.

131
00:08:24,161 --> 00:08:29,161
We'll become a wine drinking community
like Ann Arbor instead of a beer drinking

132
00:08:29,340 --> 00:08:33,100
can. Like, we've always been, well
you know what, if nobody has a job,

133
00:08:33,101 --> 00:08:36,280
there's nobody there to buy the
wine and cheese manufacturing,

134
00:08:36,281 --> 00:08:38,980
they say supports between seven
and 10 jobs within the community.

135
00:08:38,981 --> 00:08:42,790
So it means everything to the city.
The mayor's approach to it was,

136
00:08:42,970 --> 00:08:47,210
we need to take this public, not to
fight with Jim, but fight for champ

137
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:56,490
right in the heart of our city. And I
commit to doing everything in my power.

138
00:09:00,140 --> 00:09:04,910
How do you get two new plants built
when you have plants being closed around

139
00:09:04,911 --> 00:09:05,744
America

140
00:09:13,740 --> 00:09:17,790
in this time span, they literally
close dozens and dozens of plants.

141
00:09:17,791 --> 00:09:21,660
And the key part of the story is that
when the GM at that particular time at

142
00:09:21,661 --> 00:09:25,620
announce the closure, they had never
actually gone back on that decision.

143
00:09:25,621 --> 00:09:29,870
So it was a fantastic upheld
battle that these guys face.

144
00:09:29,890 --> 00:09:32,910
So back to the team,
just to define those a little bit.

145
00:09:32,911 --> 00:09:35,760
So Ray obviously mayor
Hollister was to lead them,

146
00:09:35,761 --> 00:09:39,920
trying to figure out a team to keep
GM. He uh, enlisted immediately,

147
00:09:39,930 --> 00:09:41,970
right tab your son a boy.

148
00:09:42,030 --> 00:09:46,470
That's an architectural thing but frankly
to speak engineering with GM because

149
00:09:46,471 --> 00:09:48,930
they didn't want to be
spoken to in marketing terms.

150
00:09:48,931 --> 00:09:51,460
They want it to be spoken
to an engineering terms.

151
00:09:51,461 --> 00:09:55,670
So that was part of the
strategy I guess as well. Uh,

152
00:09:55,800 --> 00:09:59,280
Terry Terry and his team,
Tom Leitz is a picture here as well.

153
00:09:59,610 --> 00:10:03,630
They're the producers. Again, all of
the while we called the PBS documentary,

154
00:10:03,631 --> 00:10:05,310
but documentary that was shown on PBS,

155
00:10:05,311 --> 00:10:08,160
at least in Detroit and it
looks like beyond that as well.

156
00:10:08,460 --> 00:10:11,670
And then the two of us are
David close again on my left.

157
00:10:11,671 --> 00:10:14,850
Your right and myself are endowed,

158
00:10:14,851 --> 00:10:16,860
chaired professors at Michigan state too.

159
00:10:16,861 --> 00:10:21,120
I've been entrenched in the auto community
and supply chain management and all

160
00:10:21,121 --> 00:10:23,610
of these different things for
years and years and years. In fact,

161
00:10:23,850 --> 00:10:27,480
David got his phd from Michigan State,
so really years and years and years.

162
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:33,200
So we're very much entrenched and
motivated to not only tell this story,

163
00:10:33,691 --> 00:10:37,740
but also capture the fact that general
motors not only provides a manufacturing

164
00:10:37,741 --> 00:10:42,741
platform for cars or provider
manufacturing platform for
a lot of different know

165
00:10:42,960 --> 00:10:46,410
high tech and other things
as well for our community.

166
00:10:46,820 --> 00:10:51,620
And it goes back to the logo. Lansing
works keep Gm. And the idea was that, uh,

167
00:10:51,810 --> 00:10:56,040
even to this day in January this year,
uh,

168
00:10:56,130 --> 00:10:59,160
I'll leave it nameless because we
don't want to compete against other

169
00:10:59,161 --> 00:11:00,990
communities per se. But, uh, this year,

170
00:11:00,991 --> 00:11:04,960
Lansing Economic Club had a senior
VP on from GM and he came in and,

171
00:11:04,980 --> 00:11:07,220
and frankly set again at the GM workforce,

172
00:11:07,221 --> 00:11:10,930
just the best we have and the GM umbrella,
you know,

173
00:11:10,950 --> 00:11:15,420
that 78 plans later around the world,
we can start arguing on ranking that.

174
00:11:15,421 --> 00:11:18,840
But nevertheless, coming in to
tell 500 people at the GM Lansing,

175
00:11:19,210 --> 00:11:23,040
a workforce just fantastically highly
qualified that this play an off the

176
00:11:23,041 --> 00:11:26,940
Lansing works. The Lansing
works. It's what the mayor
struck in the late nineties,

177
00:11:26,941 --> 00:11:31,380
as this say in just that, and
it still resonates a, okay.

178
00:11:31,381 --> 00:11:35,610
So we have the, before we're going to
shoot it out to the three coauthor share.

179
00:11:35,611 --> 00:11:36,990
We have one animated,

180
00:11:36,991 --> 00:11:41,991
the two minute clip that presents the
overview of not only the book book itself

181
00:11:42,751 --> 00:11:46,720
for sure, but the six dimensional
sort of framework for what uh,

182
00:11:46,830 --> 00:11:49,740
Lansing used in a codafide version.

183
00:11:49,741 --> 00:11:54,610
So these guys went through it and
David close and I n together with Terry

184
00:11:54,610 --> 00:11:55,150
Terry's team,

185
00:11:55,150 --> 00:11:59,830
sort of codify what the solution
actually became that can be used by other

186
00:11:59,831 --> 00:12:02,530
communities around the world,
certainly around the country.

187
00:12:02,620 --> 00:12:04,870
We know Rio de Janeiro for example,
is looking at the,

188
00:12:04,871 --> 00:12:08,390
using something like this right now
for complex problem they're having.

189
00:12:08,391 --> 00:12:10,630
And that's kind of
fascinating and out of itself.

190
00:12:10,631 --> 00:12:12,340
The book just came out
a couple of weeks ago,

191
00:12:12,760 --> 00:12:16,730
so let's take a take a look at the
animated clip and that captures, uh,

192
00:12:17,380 --> 00:12:18,640
the storyline of the book.

193
00:12:23,880 --> 00:12:28,590
When car making giant General Motors
decided to close its plant in Lansing,

194
00:12:28,591 --> 00:12:31,440
Michigan. In 1996, one person,

195
00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:35,580
the city's newly elected
mayor stood up and said, no.

196
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:39,330
Initially it was the cry
of a man in the wilderness.

197
00:12:39,810 --> 00:12:44,810
Not once in a century long history had
GM reversed a decision to close a plant,

198
00:12:45,900 --> 00:12:50,190
but mayor David Hollister quietly went
to work building the lensing works,

199
00:12:50,191 --> 00:12:54,060
keep GM movement and succeeded
in defying all the odds.

200
00:12:54,780 --> 00:12:57,630
Hollister's collaborative
problem solving approach.

201
00:12:57,780 --> 00:13:02,310
The second shift model succeeded in
bringing together state and regional

202
00:13:02,311 --> 00:13:06,120
politicians, economic
developers, private sector firms,

203
00:13:06,450 --> 00:13:09,960
labor unions,
educators and residents of the region.

204
00:13:11,220 --> 00:13:15,990
The second shift model is
a dynamic collaborative
management model that saved a

205
00:13:15,991 --> 00:13:17,430
u s manufacturing city.

206
00:13:18,270 --> 00:13:22,800
Hollister's coalition implemented a
strategic six dimensional framework to

207
00:13:22,801 --> 00:13:27,690
achieve the seemingly
impossible identifying name,
the challenge and its impact.

208
00:13:28,170 --> 00:13:30,750
Partnering,
develop meaningful relationships,

209
00:13:31,290 --> 00:13:34,710
building construct your
strategy as you go. Solving,

210
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:36,930
engage in constant problem solving,

211
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:41,490
celebrating mark successful
milestones and persevering,

212
00:13:41,910 --> 00:13:46,860
adapt and endure. It is powerful,
persuasive and well organized.

213
00:13:47,880 --> 00:13:48,930
The Lansing works.

214
00:13:48,960 --> 00:13:53,960
Keep GM movement was a victory of people
over bureaucracy of a can do attitude

215
00:13:54,690 --> 00:13:55,710
over cynicism.

216
00:13:56,610 --> 00:14:00,870
It's proof positive that when the public
and private sectors work together as

217
00:14:00,871 --> 00:14:03,240
equal partners,
both sides come away.

218
00:14:03,241 --> 00:14:07,020
Winners one of the Great
Business Sagas of modern times.

219
00:14:07,350 --> 00:14:12,350
Second Shift provides a proven practical
designed for problem solving that

220
00:14:12,451 --> 00:14:16,620
anyone can apply in any business
or community, large or small.

221
00:14:21,910 --> 00:14:24,160
So it's very easy to go back in the,
you know,

222
00:14:24,161 --> 00:14:29,161
330,000 words or a 30 70 interviews or
807 pages of interview notes if you will,

223
00:14:30,850 --> 00:14:32,890
to come up with that six
dimensional framework.

224
00:14:32,891 --> 00:14:34,750
If your professor clothes and myself,

225
00:14:35,020 --> 00:14:36,690
it's a little bit tougher
if you're retired,

226
00:14:36,691 --> 00:14:41,691
the Sean and David Hollister in 1996 to
2001 to actually figure out how to get

227
00:14:42,401 --> 00:14:46,480
all these players on board and we have
some historical documents and the book

228
00:14:46,481 --> 00:14:46,961
for example,

229
00:14:46,961 --> 00:14:51,220
one is a document that we're at 40
different at both senators from Michigan,

230
00:14:51,230 --> 00:14:53,090
lots of congressmen and on and on and on.

231
00:14:53,091 --> 00:14:56,000
A character's signed on to work together.

232
00:14:56,120 --> 00:15:00,170
There were so many different
competing interests. The
new Delta towns, your plans,

233
00:15:00,171 --> 00:15:02,900
for example,
it's a competing township technically,

234
00:15:03,110 --> 00:15:06,440
but became a collaborator in
this process and and so on.

235
00:15:06,441 --> 00:15:10,100
So the collaboration is pretty unique
and we're hoping that other communities

236
00:15:10,101 --> 00:15:14,960
can learn from that at least as a starting
framework for where to go with it.

237
00:15:15,500 --> 00:15:16,670
And that's what they are.
Again.

238
00:15:16,671 --> 00:15:20,270
So we've got the identify and we've got
partnering, we've got buildings solving,

239
00:15:20,271 --> 00:15:23,720
celebrating, persevering, eh,
there's eight chapters in the book,

240
00:15:23,721 --> 00:15:25,340
you one chapter for each of those,

241
00:15:25,550 --> 00:15:30,520
plus the introduction chapter that sets
the context to where we are as well as a

242
00:15:30,530 --> 00:15:34,010
little bit of all the different political
and other issues that have to be

243
00:15:34,640 --> 00:15:37,610
talked about it. Then figure out,
frankly solved. And then the shop there,

244
00:15:37,611 --> 00:15:41,360
eighth comes back to managerially talk
about perhaps how to implement it and

245
00:15:41,361 --> 00:15:43,640
where to go with it.
In the process.

246
00:15:43,641 --> 00:15:47,480
We have quotes from senator
this precedent that x, Y,

247
00:15:47,481 --> 00:15:51,290
and z throughout the book and everywhere
weaving them together in a nice

248
00:15:51,291 --> 00:15:53,480
storyline,
including 37 I believe,

249
00:15:53,481 --> 00:15:56,680
different challenges as well
as the six dimensions here.

250
00:15:56,690 --> 00:15:58,490
Filter down to 33 different,

251
00:15:58,690 --> 00:16:01,160
I'm gonna call them variables
right now since I'm an academic.

252
00:16:01,640 --> 00:16:04,340
But these guys will dwell
on them here in a minute.

253
00:16:04,850 --> 00:16:08,960
So let's look at those a little
bit in the context of second shift.

254
00:16:08,961 --> 00:16:10,910
And I wasn't going to do this, but, uh,

255
00:16:10,970 --> 00:16:14,720
we'll call a mayor Hollister right away
on second shift because I think I've

256
00:16:14,721 --> 00:16:17,570
been talking about this. Why did they
call the book Second Shift Mayor?

257
00:16:23,140 --> 00:16:27,130
We are wanting to take the opportunity to,

258
00:16:27,610 --> 00:16:29,740
when we did the launch of the Alero,

259
00:16:30,610 --> 00:16:34,270
which was a part of the 100
year celebration of the phone,

260
00:16:34,290 --> 00:16:39,290
involves going to bill and send a signal
to General Motors in Detroit that we

261
00:16:40,481 --> 00:16:44,380
were so confident in our
workforce that it was our, our,

262
00:16:45,040 --> 00:16:50,040
our strongest asset that we
would launch the project.

263
00:16:50,600 --> 00:16:53,680
Uh, on the second shift,
traditionally new, uh,

264
00:16:53,920 --> 00:16:57,490
shifts or new products are done in
the first shift where I have all the

265
00:16:57,491 --> 00:17:02,491
engineers and the managers and the
executives and the senior UAW leadership.

266
00:17:02,681 --> 00:17:07,030
So the old foxes of the unions,
uh, and my dad included, it,

267
00:17:07,031 --> 00:17:11,650
worked there 35 years. So
Jim's UPC code, the, uh, uh,

268
00:17:11,900 --> 00:17:15,190
the, uh, manager of the
plant and our Baker,

269
00:17:15,191 --> 00:17:19,150
the local UAW guy came to me and said,
we want to send a signal.

270
00:17:19,260 --> 00:17:21,290
We're going to put it all on the table,
we're going to sec a,

271
00:17:21,310 --> 00:17:24,790
launch it on the second shift and get
their attention. So that's what we did.

272
00:17:25,390 --> 00:17:30,390
Now we had to identify the problem because
General Motors to just inform me that

273
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:34,510
they're going to be having this
wonderful a week long celebration.

274
00:17:34,540 --> 00:17:37,900
Thousands of people coming, thousands
of cars. It's going to be great.

275
00:17:38,410 --> 00:17:41,320
And we're going to launch this alarm
on Lansing. This is all good news.

276
00:17:42,220 --> 00:17:46,300
But the bad news is when that production
is over that we have no product,

277
00:17:46,560 --> 00:17:51,270
the General Motors, it's not
going to in the region. And uh,

278
00:17:51,271 --> 00:17:53,970
that that's kind of a sock in the stomach.
And he also said,

279
00:17:54,270 --> 00:17:58,770
you can't tell anybody. So this
is a private information, uh,

280
00:17:59,370 --> 00:18:02,820
uh, you can, uh, decide which can
do. And I'm a newly elected mayor,

281
00:18:02,821 --> 00:18:06,640
this is not great news. I can figure
out how maybe I can get out of town, uh,

282
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:09,750
and run for something else
or, you know, forget this,

283
00:18:09,751 --> 00:18:11,310
give it to the chamber to figure out.

284
00:18:12,120 --> 00:18:15,310
But we decided to partner with a gym sock,

285
00:18:15,320 --> 00:18:20,040
couldn't the UAW and uh,
and uh, use that launch, uh,

286
00:18:20,290 --> 00:18:25,080
to, to do it. Uh, we had two, two, two,
two tasks as we defined the problem.

287
00:18:25,081 --> 00:18:27,780
I mean this is falls under the
category of identifying the problem.

288
00:18:28,310 --> 00:18:30,860
I was just going to move on to
identifying which is your topic.

289
00:18:30,861 --> 00:18:34,490
May or so we will keep the mayor
going on in identifying the problem.

290
00:18:34,550 --> 00:18:35,450
Tell us about that.

291
00:18:36,950 --> 00:18:37,391
Well we're not,

292
00:18:37,391 --> 00:18:42,391
he came there at General Motors was the
number one company in the fortune 500 my

293
00:18:42,621 --> 00:18:45,050
dad worked for General
Motors for 35 years.

294
00:18:45,051 --> 00:18:48,350
My father in law worked
with the same 30 plus years.

295
00:18:48,830 --> 00:18:50,240
We took General Motors for granted.

296
00:18:50,270 --> 00:18:51,770
We thought that you've
got the state government,

297
00:18:51,771 --> 00:18:55,070
you've got Michigan State University
and you've got GM and that's the three

298
00:18:55,071 --> 00:18:59,390
pillars and that provided a middle class
income and it's going to go on forever.

299
00:18:59,850 --> 00:19:04,230
Little did we realize that below the
surface that allow general motors was a

300
00:19:04,280 --> 00:19:08,060
planning, the launch, the a, the
campaign on the 100th birthday,

301
00:19:08,660 --> 00:19:13,160
they were retrenching and
between 1990 and 2005,

302
00:19:13,580 --> 00:19:18,110
they actually closed 40 plants.
And once they announced the closing,

303
00:19:18,260 --> 00:19:21,800
they never reverse themselves.
So we were looking at the reality,

304
00:19:21,801 --> 00:19:26,801
we were being told we're going to close
your plants after 2005 a these are the

305
00:19:27,321 --> 00:19:30,410
oldest plants. Uh, they
were 100 years old. Uh,

306
00:19:30,590 --> 00:19:34,520
some of the buildings I had wood floors,
so it was a fire hazard.

307
00:19:34,521 --> 00:19:39,010
And so you had the legacy costs and,
and,

308
00:19:39,250 --> 00:19:43,460
and, and you had a number of
other, um, factors going on.

309
00:19:44,870 --> 00:19:49,220
We had to educate General Motors about
why they needed to stay and we had to

310
00:19:49,221 --> 00:19:51,920
reeducate them about the
value of our workforce.

311
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:54,140
And we had to get our own act together.

312
00:19:54,680 --> 00:19:59,680
When I talked to Donovan and he talked
to Donald and was the GM vice president,

313
00:20:01,160 --> 00:20:04,490
uh, he wanted to know who he would
be working with in the region,

314
00:20:04,491 --> 00:20:08,720
how many different taxing units
were there in the Tri County area.

315
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:10,170
And it turned out that though,

316
00:20:10,180 --> 00:20:15,180
I didn't know at the time there were 130
taxing units and General Motors wanted

317
00:20:15,921 --> 00:20:18,380
to deal with just one with one.

318
00:20:18,740 --> 00:20:23,540
So we had to create an unified regional,

319
00:20:23,850 --> 00:20:24,683
uh,
uh,

320
00:20:25,190 --> 00:20:29,420
problem solving a strategy
that could reverse a decision,

321
00:20:29,421 --> 00:20:33,490
has never been reversed by General
Motors and do that knowing that, uh, the,

322
00:20:33,491 --> 00:20:38,390
the economy was pretty shaky and a
of foreign competition was coming in.

323
00:20:38,420 --> 00:20:42,830
They were losing market share and we
were going to have to change all that

324
00:20:43,500 --> 00:20:47,550
territory.
So just concluding your about the

325
00:20:48,330 --> 00:20:49,690
why it was called second shift.

326
00:20:50,110 --> 00:20:54,250
The Alero was launched on the second
shift and it was the most successful new

327
00:20:54,251 --> 00:20:56,470
product launch and GMS entire history.

328
00:20:57,010 --> 00:20:59,950
When Jim has told us that and
the interview we just said,

329
00:21:00,100 --> 00:21:04,410
that's gotta be the title. And
uh, and the story of course,

330
00:21:04,411 --> 00:21:08,420
just that nobody works on the second and
third shift except torics those, darn,

331
00:21:08,490 --> 00:21:10,230
it's a necessity to work shift I guess.

332
00:21:10,231 --> 00:21:13,550
But that's a fantastic story to tell them
that the engineers and everybody else

333
00:21:13,551 --> 00:21:17,160
was home sleeping and we still trust
to this community to take care of that

334
00:21:17,161 --> 00:21:21,120
particular, uh, launch, which
became incredibly successful.

335
00:21:21,121 --> 00:21:24,150
Developing meaning real
meaningful relationships.

336
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:28,260
It's the next story and the sixth
dimensional framework that we also called

337
00:21:28,261 --> 00:21:30,660
partnering. It's a little hard
to see on the yellow one there,

338
00:21:30,990 --> 00:21:33,000
but developing meaningful partnerships.

339
00:21:33,001 --> 00:21:36,420
And I already alluded to this and we're
going to invoke ray tab. You're Sean,

340
00:21:36,421 --> 00:21:40,890
because we had the 40,
incredibly high lofty community members,

341
00:21:41,190 --> 00:21:46,140
uh, sign on to doing this stuff where I'm
not sure all 40 of them compete against

342
00:21:46,141 --> 00:21:47,910
each other before they
signed this document.

343
00:21:47,911 --> 00:21:50,320
But it seemingly could have
been that way the way you,

344
00:21:50,370 --> 00:21:51,960
our friends tell the story.

345
00:21:51,961 --> 00:21:55,260
So there was a lot of competition and
they came through the same table at this

346
00:21:55,261 --> 00:21:56,340
particular point in time,
right?

347
00:21:59,620 --> 00:22:04,620
The mayor's vision for this campaign was
to bring people together and make it a

348
00:22:05,981 --> 00:22:09,370
collaborative effort.
Now when you have competing townships,

349
00:22:09,371 --> 00:22:14,260
who would love to have the any new
product line, any new plant, uh,

350
00:22:14,350 --> 00:22:18,160
they're all looking out for their own
self interest as they should be because

351
00:22:18,161 --> 00:22:21,670
they're representing their constituents
while the mayor was representing the

352
00:22:21,671 --> 00:22:22,504
region.

353
00:22:22,540 --> 00:22:26,020
And that's the way he wanted to come
across is that this was a regional effort.

354
00:22:26,650 --> 00:22:30,820
So trying to get those 40 communities
to get on board, plus the chamber,

355
00:22:30,850 --> 00:22:35,050
plus the city council, people were
telling him, you're wasting your time.

356
00:22:35,440 --> 00:22:38,530
GM has never changed their mind
about doing something like this.

357
00:22:38,710 --> 00:22:40,780
When they're going to close the plant,
they're going to close the plant.

358
00:22:41,350 --> 00:22:45,670
So why are you wasting your time wasting
the city's money, wasting your energy,

359
00:22:45,671 --> 00:22:48,670
your efforts, you can put your
time into something better.

360
00:22:49,510 --> 00:22:51,850
But the mayor had a vision.

361
00:22:51,910 --> 00:22:55,180
He wanted this to be a world
class city and the anchor,

362
00:22:55,181 --> 00:22:57,730
one of the anchors to that
would be general motors,

363
00:22:58,150 --> 00:23:01,870
keeping them and trying to
convince them to stay. So,

364
00:23:02,440 --> 00:23:06,790
in doing so, he brought on all these
different elements of the community,

365
00:23:07,150 --> 00:23:10,870
neighborhood people,
uh, the Union folks, uh,

366
00:23:10,930 --> 00:23:13,930
just about everyone that you can
think of somehow got on board.

367
00:23:14,650 --> 00:23:18,820
We started and launched the Blue Ribbon
Committee and we had 28 people there

368
00:23:19,150 --> 00:23:23,980
that were a part of the committee
at the time. We eventually had, uh,

369
00:23:24,010 --> 00:23:27,820
50 people on that committee and,
but that was too large.

370
00:23:27,850 --> 00:23:32,590
You couldn't make decisions. The
discussions became like a free for all.

371
00:23:32,830 --> 00:23:36,850
And uh, so we had to create what
we call the quick response team.

372
00:23:37,450 --> 00:23:42,450
That was a team of about six folks who
met weekly to try to make decisions on

373
00:23:43,001 --> 00:23:46,190
what was going to be said to the public,
how much going to be said to the public,

374
00:23:46,490 --> 00:23:49,560
where were we at in the status,
what was her next challenge? Uh,

375
00:23:49,580 --> 00:23:54,200
Thomas alluded that there were over 35
major challenges and I'm talking about

376
00:23:54,201 --> 00:23:55,250
major challenges,

377
00:23:55,460 --> 00:24:00,050
getting the edge legislature to
change the laws to enable, uh,

378
00:24:00,500 --> 00:24:05,500
a tax abatements and incentives to be
used to retain a plant as opposed to

379
00:24:05,931 --> 00:24:09,860
trying to retract new jobs. Uh,
getting the chamber on board,

380
00:24:09,920 --> 00:24:13,550
they were convinced they were going to
lead this effort that took weeks to get

381
00:24:13,551 --> 00:24:16,580
resolved and getting the
townships on onboard.

382
00:24:16,910 --> 00:24:19,310
They really didn't want to do this,

383
00:24:19,311 --> 00:24:22,850
but they felt like they had to because
they needed to keep an eye on Dave.

384
00:24:22,960 --> 00:24:26,660
They knew they didn't want him doing
something that he shouldn't be doing.

385
00:24:27,110 --> 00:24:30,470
So these people all got on
board and the city console,

386
00:24:30,530 --> 00:24:32,180
he actually had to change the console,

387
00:24:32,420 --> 00:24:35,630
get three new people on board
because there were three negatives.

388
00:24:35,631 --> 00:24:39,890
Then you heard the story about we become
like Ann Arbor wine drinking instead of

389
00:24:39,891 --> 00:24:41,210
beer drinking and bowling town.

390
00:24:44,750 --> 00:24:49,400
Eh, depends on the, well Jason
says otherwise, but you know,

391
00:24:51,900 --> 00:24:54,920
at any rate, partnering became
a big part of this. And uh,

392
00:24:54,940 --> 00:24:59,330
so the mayor asked me if I would do
this and when I, when he first asked me,

393
00:24:59,720 --> 00:25:04,720
because we had a successful partnership
before that in building the Baseball

394
00:25:04,730 --> 00:25:08,540
Stadium Downtown Lansing. So when he asked
me, Ray, can you do this? I said, sure,

395
00:25:08,570 --> 00:25:13,400
absolutely. We were going back from
Toledo, so we had a two hour bus drive.

396
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:16,970
And I'm thinking all the way back
to last week. What did I just do?

397
00:25:18,020 --> 00:25:21,110
I don't have a clue as to how to do this.
But then we put,

398
00:25:21,140 --> 00:25:24,320
I put together a strategic plan for
this and created all these different

399
00:25:24,321 --> 00:25:28,490
partnerships and all of these
subcommittees and uh, figure it out.

400
00:25:28,520 --> 00:25:31,790
If everybody did their job,
we might have a shot. So

401
00:25:31,990 --> 00:25:34,470
we're going to build plants
in about five or six slides.

402
00:25:34,980 --> 00:25:39,960
We're going to build a couple of plants.
Uh, that's a fantastic undertaking,

403
00:25:39,961 --> 00:25:43,470
an achievement to get 40 of those sets.
I know it's impossible to see,

404
00:25:43,471 --> 00:25:44,460
but if you look in the book,

405
00:25:44,461 --> 00:25:47,370
you're going to see all of those
different titles and characters that I

406
00:25:47,371 --> 00:25:50,820
described,
if we construct your strategy as you go.

407
00:25:50,821 --> 00:25:52,440
So the last thing on the planet,

408
00:25:52,470 --> 00:25:55,440
anybody should do is construct
your strategy as you go.

409
00:25:55,620 --> 00:25:59,300
You usually want to plan of some
kind and unfollow a roadmap.

410
00:25:59,400 --> 00:26:03,870
But we're frankly at Google and the
first place I can think of where you

411
00:26:03,871 --> 00:26:07,230
construct your strategy as you go.
It's probably a company like this.

412
00:26:07,231 --> 00:26:10,410
So at least one company on the planet,
they may resonate.

413
00:26:10,411 --> 00:26:13,380
What the mayor Hollister and
rates had the son dead. Eh,

414
00:26:13,420 --> 00:26:16,620
that's not the norm that the General
Motors would fall for example,

415
00:26:16,621 --> 00:26:19,230
but that's the norm that had to be
followed. In this particular case.

416
00:26:19,590 --> 00:26:21,450
On the left hand side there of the slide,

417
00:26:21,480 --> 00:26:23,520
you see a bunch of those
variables if you will,

418
00:26:23,521 --> 00:26:27,300
to under sub dimensions of these things.
We're not going to go into those,

419
00:26:27,301 --> 00:26:30,420
but they are described and talked about
in the book and how they were used to

420
00:26:30,421 --> 00:26:32,070
construct your strategy as you go.

421
00:26:32,370 --> 00:26:34,980
I'm going to invoke David
close on that particular topic.

422
00:26:36,970 --> 00:26:39,670
Thank you, Thomas. It was,

423
00:26:40,130 --> 00:26:44,550
it was not a situation where you could
develop a strategy and a and then

424
00:26:44,610 --> 00:26:47,310
executed.
It was far too dynamic than that.

425
00:26:47,700 --> 00:26:51,660
As you see some of the key points on
on the list that Thomas said on the

426
00:26:51,661 --> 00:26:56,120
previous slide, there's someone, uh,
you, you have a dynamic environment of a,

427
00:26:56,670 --> 00:26:58,320
what's the auto industry looked like?

428
00:26:58,321 --> 00:27:03,321
It was clear the auto
industry was changing from a
situation where you had the

429
00:27:03,421 --> 00:27:08,421
people that came out of a high school
and the vocab thing to a very high tech

430
00:27:08,670 --> 00:27:12,060
development process.
Changing workforce. Uh,

431
00:27:12,061 --> 00:27:16,620
it was clear in this case, we have a
very big challenge in communicating,

432
00:27:16,900 --> 00:27:20,900
uh, to the environment you had is,
is Dave Hollister talked about, uh,

433
00:27:20,910 --> 00:27:25,440
the challenge of, uh, the internal
group that you shared information with.

434
00:27:25,620 --> 00:27:30,120
You have the community who wasn't
quite sure of what's going on here. Uh,

435
00:27:30,121 --> 00:27:32,120
you have general motors who is saying,

436
00:27:32,130 --> 00:27:34,110
we made a decision and
we're going to move on.

437
00:27:34,350 --> 00:27:37,470
And then you have local people
from General Motors who,

438
00:27:37,490 --> 00:27:41,310
who know that the quality of the
Lansing workforce. And so it was,

439
00:27:41,311 --> 00:27:46,230
is keeping those four things, those four
balls in the air throughout the process.

440
00:27:46,530 --> 00:27:50,640
And that, that became a lot of the
challenges as we read through the, uh, um,

441
00:27:50,820 --> 00:27:53,010
the manuscripts and the interviews.

442
00:27:53,310 --> 00:27:56,970
It's like looking at those
things and balancing them and,

443
00:27:57,180 --> 00:28:02,130
and doing the trade offs and, uh,
just having a strategy in place and,

444
00:28:02,131 --> 00:28:05,360
and, and, and keeping that going,
uh, was the key part. And that's,

445
00:28:05,560 --> 00:28:09,330
that's one of the key lessons. I think
one other point I want wanted to make,

446
00:28:09,331 --> 00:28:13,320
and we're Dave Hollister
and I first started working
together, is if you look at,

447
00:28:13,920 --> 00:28:18,000
uh, many communities trying to
retain manufacturing environment,

448
00:28:18,001 --> 00:28:21,210
which is something that
I've worked on a lot, it's,

449
00:28:21,330 --> 00:28:23,660
there's historically a lot of uh,

450
00:28:23,880 --> 00:28:28,880
conflict as is ray talked about and
how do I get them to realize that for a

451
00:28:29,421 --> 00:28:33,990
business point of view, a city's boundary
or counties boundary is irrelevant.

452
00:28:34,560 --> 00:28:37,770
It's how do I put together a
region and get the workforce to,

453
00:28:37,771 --> 00:28:41,820
to make it work together. And that's
not, that's not just a Lansing problem,

454
00:28:42,060 --> 00:28:45,600
although I think this story
shows that we've a cow, uh,

455
00:28:45,900 --> 00:28:49,020
did a lot to accomplish it,
but it's other regions too,

456
00:28:49,021 --> 00:28:50,310
including southeast Michigan.

457
00:28:52,160 --> 00:28:52,610
Okay.

458
00:28:52,610 --> 00:28:56,240
The dynamic nature of problem
solving is played up and,

459
00:28:56,241 --> 00:28:59,910
and will be called engage in constant
problem solving as well. I mean,

460
00:28:59,911 --> 00:29:03,960
think about where you guys are right now.
Self driving cars,

461
00:29:03,961 --> 00:29:08,961
just a totally different phenomenon from
late nineties or 50 years ago or 1897

462
00:29:10,351 --> 00:29:14,760
if you want to go really far back.
And that's not the same mindset.

463
00:29:14,761 --> 00:29:16,740
Same strategy,
same person,

464
00:29:17,010 --> 00:29:19,980
same toolkit to actually
get into that arena.

465
00:29:20,010 --> 00:29:23,280
Even though seemingly for the average
customer, it seems like it's a car,

466
00:29:23,580 --> 00:29:27,420
but it's a total different dynamic. And
I think these guys ran into that as well.

467
00:29:27,770 --> 00:29:31,440
Uh, engage in problems in constant
problem solving. We're going to recycle.

468
00:29:31,441 --> 00:29:35,070
We're going to go back to a mayor
Hollister to talk about engaging constant

469
00:29:35,071 --> 00:29:35,904
problem solving.

470
00:29:38,760 --> 00:29:42,340
Well, I was confronted with this
knowledge. The gentleman was leaving,

471
00:29:42,910 --> 00:29:46,350
uh, the Chamber of Commerce, uh,

472
00:29:46,351 --> 00:29:50,590
wanted to continue to take the lead
on a retention that was one of their

473
00:29:50,591 --> 00:29:55,090
traditional roles. I didn't feel that
was going to be adequate. Uh, and,

474
00:29:55,360 --> 00:30:00,220
and I had to think about any community
could offer a tax break. I mean,

475
00:30:00,221 --> 00:30:03,730
any, all communities, all states
have some kind of tax package.

476
00:30:04,180 --> 00:30:08,080
We wanted to go beyond that and
create something very unique.

477
00:30:08,530 --> 00:30:13,530
So we created a single entry single exit,

478
00:30:15,010 --> 00:30:19,090
one stop shopping and
problem solving center.

479
00:30:19,540 --> 00:30:22,630
So we said to the community
and to General Motors,

480
00:30:22,631 --> 00:30:27,550
if you have any problem that
you want solved, you bring
it to the mayor's office.

481
00:30:27,551 --> 00:30:31,330
That's the one,
one stop single entry.

482
00:30:31,420 --> 00:30:34,810
And that if the mirror is office isn't,
uh,

483
00:30:34,990 --> 00:30:39,460
we identifying or justifying the,
the data,

484
00:30:40,240 --> 00:30:41,380
then it's just a rumor.

485
00:30:41,440 --> 00:30:44,440
I mean it's Kinda become
directly from the mayor's office.

486
00:30:44,441 --> 00:30:48,160
So you've got a single entry single exit,
one stop.

487
00:30:48,610 --> 00:30:52,210
And we asked General Motors to give
us 30 days and any problem they wanted

488
00:30:52,211 --> 00:30:56,200
solved any problem and we would tackle
it and we would come up with a solution.

489
00:30:56,830 --> 00:31:00,250
We had a problem of odor
on the, uh, on the, uh,

490
00:31:00,251 --> 00:31:04,860
west side of town and we
engaged the community to,

491
00:31:04,861 --> 00:31:07,690
to solve that. We got the health
department involved, got neighbors,

492
00:31:07,990 --> 00:31:12,340
Neighborhood Association involved, the
environmental groups who are out there,

493
00:31:12,440 --> 00:31:16,170
uh, you know, opposing us initially, uh,

494
00:31:16,270 --> 00:31:19,600
saying that General Motors shouldn't
be getting more capacity to build in

495
00:31:19,601 --> 00:31:24,520
Lansing because of the air quality
was not adequate. And, and so,

496
00:31:24,521 --> 00:31:28,930
uh, we had to figure out that strategy.
Uh, we got the schools involved.

497
00:31:29,610 --> 00:31:32,920
Um, we put an, uh, an air monitoring, uh,

498
00:31:32,921 --> 00:31:35,550
m and a weather monitoring,
uh,

499
00:31:35,590 --> 00:31:38,710
equipment at the local high
school football stadium.

500
00:31:38,820 --> 00:31:43,820
And so they could get the every day
they were getting data on air speed and

501
00:31:44,531 --> 00:31:46,990
temperature and humidity
and all that stuff.

502
00:31:47,470 --> 00:31:50,560
And I've got the schools involved
in the students involved.

503
00:31:50,561 --> 00:31:55,030
And then we got the engineers at General
Motors to start tutoring in the schools.

504
00:31:55,240 --> 00:31:59,260
So we had to try to be very comprehensive
in our, and our strategy. Uh,

505
00:31:59,350 --> 00:32:02,290
General Motors a as we won the,
uh,

506
00:32:02,320 --> 00:32:07,210
the designation of the most
successful launch ever, uh, uh, uh,

507
00:32:07,790 --> 00:32:10,750
uh,
Mark A.

508
00:32:10,750 --> 00:32:14,440
Hogan indicated that he would
consider Lansing for the plant.

509
00:32:14,470 --> 00:32:17,050
We were originally told her you
wouldn't have any chance at all,

510
00:32:17,290 --> 00:32:22,290
but because we were so successful in his
problem solving that he gave us a shot

511
00:32:22,631 --> 00:32:27,200
at it. Uh, and so we
had to, we had to, uh,

512
00:32:27,430 --> 00:32:31,780
deliver on that promise, but it
was, uh, we brought to the table,

513
00:32:32,520 --> 00:32:36,310
the township officials, the city
officials, the state officials,

514
00:32:36,640 --> 00:32:39,980
the governor and I were at odds
with each other. The legislature,

515
00:32:39,981 --> 00:32:42,620
I was a liberal democrat.
He was a conservative Republican.

516
00:32:42,830 --> 00:32:45,030
We fought like cats and dogs.
Uh,

517
00:32:45,200 --> 00:32:48,830
but when we were both executives
trying to save this industry,

518
00:32:50,660 --> 00:32:55,600
we decided to, to work together. So
we put together a strategy and we, uh,

519
00:32:55,670 --> 00:32:58,610
delivered on it and we solved
virtually every problem.

520
00:32:59,300 --> 00:33:02,390
And one of the key ones was rate,
looked at the internet,

521
00:33:02,420 --> 00:33:07,420
figured out how to build a plant
and the downtown Lansing site,

522
00:33:08,270 --> 00:33:10,760
uh, and do it without, uh,

523
00:33:11,300 --> 00:33:16,300
disrupting the production and without
taking a greenfield and turn it into a,

524
00:33:17,180 --> 00:33:18,200
uh,
a plant.

525
00:33:18,790 --> 00:33:22,410
Actually, let's start it over to ray
to tell the plant stores a little bit.

526
00:33:23,970 --> 00:33:27,940
Well, that plant story's kind of
interesting because when Marc Hogan,

527
00:33:27,941 --> 00:33:31,510
the vice president for General Motors
said he was considering building a plant.

528
00:33:32,170 --> 00:33:34,030
They were building Cadillacs in Eisenach,

529
00:33:34,031 --> 00:33:37,630
Germany and they wanted
to stop that production,

530
00:33:37,720 --> 00:33:41,950
bring the Cadillacs back to the
United States. They didn't say where,

531
00:33:42,040 --> 00:33:46,540
but they didn't say or when, but they
were going to build a plant somewhere.

532
00:33:47,500 --> 00:33:52,060
Well to really try to figure out what
they wanted to do and why they want it to

533
00:33:52,061 --> 00:33:52,361
do it.

534
00:33:52,361 --> 00:33:56,590
They had to build a business case here
to that says it would be cost effective

535
00:33:56,591 --> 00:34:00,790
to build it wherever they're going
to build it. Well fortunately for me,

536
00:34:00,791 --> 00:34:05,260
I was led to a set of plans that came
from the plant manager at the time Jim's

537
00:34:05,261 --> 00:34:07,770
up,
cause he pointed me to a,

538
00:34:07,771 --> 00:34:12,700
a set of photocopies of a
plant that was built in Brazil.

539
00:34:13,270 --> 00:34:17,980
It had a code name blue McCall.
This was very confidential information.

540
00:34:17,981 --> 00:34:20,140
He told me,
you can't share this with anybody.

541
00:34:20,290 --> 00:34:24,820
You can't tell anybody where you got it
from. I said, okay, can I tell the mayor?

542
00:34:24,850 --> 00:34:28,900
He goes, okay, there's three of us.
And so I shared it with the mayor,

543
00:34:29,530 --> 00:34:34,360
but it took me a week to figure out would
that plant fit or not because it was

544
00:34:34,361 --> 00:34:39,361
in metric and it was virtually
indiscernible as to what was on that.

545
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:42,310
So I had to create a new scale.

546
00:34:42,610 --> 00:34:46,390
It was a scale of like one
inch equals 167 meters.

547
00:34:46,930 --> 00:34:50,350
Something weird. You know, most
scales are not like that. Well,

548
00:34:50,351 --> 00:34:54,310
I had to figure that out and figured
it out that this plant was built on 70

549
00:34:54,311 --> 00:34:57,910
acres.
There was 180 at the existing plant site,

550
00:34:58,210 --> 00:35:00,970
about half of which could be torn down.

551
00:35:00,971 --> 00:35:03,490
And the buildings that were on there
could be torn down. They were vacant,

552
00:35:03,491 --> 00:35:07,690
there were storage areas. So I said to
Jim, if you tear those buildings down,

553
00:35:07,750 --> 00:35:08,920
this plant will fit there.

554
00:35:09,910 --> 00:35:14,910
So Mark Hogan happened to be the vice
president who oversaw the project in

555
00:35:15,641 --> 00:35:19,540
Brazil. And so when I showed
him this plan and said,

556
00:35:19,690 --> 00:35:24,460
we can put this footprint on that plant
site, he said, where did you get that?

557
00:35:24,970 --> 00:35:26,140
I said,
research.

558
00:35:26,530 --> 00:35:31,390
And so we offered to take it back to
Detroit with him and he said that wasn't

559
00:35:31,391 --> 00:35:35,800
necessary. He would take it himself.
And several months later he said,

560
00:35:35,801 --> 00:35:36,790
we're going to build that plant.

561
00:35:39,940 --> 00:35:40,670
So we,

562
00:35:40,670 --> 00:35:44,710
we went through this celebrate [inaudible]
thing here of intermediate steps.

563
00:35:44,720 --> 00:35:46,340
Obviously this is a long process.

564
00:35:46,341 --> 00:35:50,890
So part of the model includes
celebrating as well as we go along.

565
00:35:51,190 --> 00:35:55,180
And then the last one is persevering.
And that should go for obvious reason,

566
00:35:55,210 --> 00:35:57,460
but if you don't celebrate till the end,
they're like,

567
00:35:57,461 --> 00:35:59,680
we oftentimes do when
this particular process,

568
00:35:59,710 --> 00:36:04,390
you don't get the community behind you
or these 40 different people signing on

569
00:36:04,391 --> 00:36:06,190
and the organizations they represented.

570
00:36:06,191 --> 00:36:10,270
So the celebration became an intermediate
as well as a final step in the process

571
00:36:10,480 --> 00:36:13,120
and clearly getting a 70
acre plant where they may,

572
00:36:13,121 --> 00:36:17,890
I wanted a couple of hundred acres or
really want to 300 acres and on and on.

573
00:36:17,891 --> 00:36:20,220
And we're going to talk more
about acreage here on the,

574
00:36:20,221 --> 00:36:21,910
on the last final slide I think.

575
00:36:22,330 --> 00:36:26,740
So moving on to persevering and that's
adapt and endure in this particular

576
00:36:26,741 --> 00:36:31,360
context. And I'm going to invoke a
professor close again on that topic.

577
00:36:33,830 --> 00:36:34,161
Again,

578
00:36:34,161 --> 00:36:39,161
this is the whole process is a very
dynamic environment and we had to adapt as

579
00:36:39,501 --> 00:36:43,940
the, the educational structure change,
the workforce structure changed. Uh,

580
00:36:43,941 --> 00:36:48,860
and even the, uh, the supply chain
structure changed. We had to bring in, uh,

581
00:36:48,890 --> 00:36:51,420
suppliers and uh,
um,

582
00:36:52,460 --> 00:36:57,340
get them involved in the process as we
came to the step of a second plant. Uh,

583
00:36:57,350 --> 00:37:01,430
other issues came in in terms of
integrating that. So, uh, the,

584
00:37:01,490 --> 00:37:04,930
the overall process, the
realization I think is that, um,

585
00:37:06,590 --> 00:37:09,740
it's not, you just create a plant
and it's going to last a long time.

586
00:37:10,100 --> 00:37:12,320
The plant is changing day to day.

587
00:37:12,710 --> 00:37:17,710
And we had to switch that reality
both for both for General Motors and,

588
00:37:17,851 --> 00:37:21,350
and of course they realize that.
But the community I don't think did,

589
00:37:21,351 --> 00:37:25,610
and some of the lessons that that came
out of the interviews where what we have

590
00:37:25,611 --> 00:37:28,490
to do with the community
to make it realize that.

591
00:37:28,590 --> 00:37:33,110
And I think a Dr. Simon had miss you
made a very good quote on the back of the

592
00:37:33,111 --> 00:37:34,130
book where she said,

593
00:37:34,430 --> 00:37:38,180
we have to not take for granted what
we've had here in the past and be able to

594
00:37:38,181 --> 00:37:41,920
adapt for it. And, and that's really one
of the big lessons that came out of it

595
00:37:43,840 --> 00:37:47,650
and not the gloss over celebration too
much. Jason, of course, invited us here,

596
00:37:47,651 --> 00:37:48,341
which is kind of cool.

597
00:37:48,341 --> 00:37:52,270
And I think this was about two years
after Jason Played Basketball for Tamia.

598
00:37:52,271 --> 00:37:53,930
So at Michigan State,
uh,

599
00:37:54,640 --> 00:37:57,640
we're guessing it was mayor
was about 1998 season,

600
00:37:57,670 --> 00:38:01,930
give or take that he dedicated to the
whole team and their season was dedicated

601
00:38:01,931 --> 00:38:05,830
to the keep general motors in
the community as a campaign,
which is pretty cool.

602
00:38:06,600 --> 00:38:08,320
So a couple of years after that again,

603
00:38:08,350 --> 00:38:11,950
but he missed the dedication
to General Motors Jason did,

604
00:38:11,951 --> 00:38:15,250
but he certainly won a
national championship that
may have been a better deal of

605
00:38:15,251 --> 00:38:19,300
the, of the two. For us it was keeping
GM and winning national championships.

606
00:38:19,301 --> 00:38:23,050
We want all of the above two
plants were built in a process.

607
00:38:23,080 --> 00:38:25,600
Ultimately the outcome of
the storyline and stuff,

608
00:38:25,601 --> 00:38:29,750
there's a 2001 plan to build
at the Grand River Assembly,

609
00:38:30,080 --> 00:38:31,270
the 70 acres dot.

610
00:38:31,270 --> 00:38:36,100
Right tag or Sean was talking about where
there were 180 or so acres available.

611
00:38:36,101 --> 00:38:38,140
That's a hundred year old.

612
00:38:38,141 --> 00:38:42,820
The on top of each other type plan with
nice drawings from Brazil. I mean the,

613
00:38:42,821 --> 00:38:46,030
the storyline there is pretty deep and
interesting if you dig into the book as

614
00:38:46,031 --> 00:38:46,864
well.

615
00:38:47,050 --> 00:38:51,280
And then Delta township a
in 2006 that plant open.

616
00:38:51,281 --> 00:38:55,630
So the Delta township supervisor, a mayor,
I'm not sure exactly the title there,

617
00:38:55,631 --> 00:38:56,111
but anyway,

618
00:38:56,111 --> 00:39:00,160
the leader of Delta township signed on
almost immediately when mayor Hollister

619
00:39:00,161 --> 00:39:03,850
said, can you help out Lansing and
support our costs? And sure enough,

620
00:39:03,851 --> 00:39:06,490
five years later,
which is really short time period,

621
00:39:06,670 --> 00:39:08,410
they get their own gigantic plant.

622
00:39:08,411 --> 00:39:11,920
The Delta Township plan producers
a little over 1100 cars a day.

623
00:39:11,921 --> 00:39:16,750
Right now the Grand River assembler
produces about 700 and there were about

624
00:39:16,751 --> 00:39:20,890
6,500 to be exact employees in town.
Um,

625
00:39:21,100 --> 00:39:25,210
and I guess the UAW leadership loves
to tell the story about the last year

626
00:39:25,211 --> 00:39:29,500
they've hired a thousand new workers and
all of them actually became members of

627
00:39:29,501 --> 00:39:33,550
the union. So that's a storyline that
the, those guys like telling as well.

628
00:39:34,360 --> 00:39:39,250
And our story, if according to Mayor
Hollister, uh, may not stop there,

629
00:39:39,251 --> 00:39:41,530
this is the second,
the last slide.

630
00:39:41,531 --> 00:39:44,090
So that's why we want to poke
on the community a little bit.

631
00:39:44,091 --> 00:39:48,280
So as recently as June of this
year, uh, mayor Hollister,

632
00:39:48,281 --> 00:39:50,000
when our record and saying that,
you know,

633
00:39:50,001 --> 00:39:55,001
in General Motors owns 1100 acres
of farm land next to Delta Township,

634
00:39:55,061 --> 00:39:55,900
that plant,

635
00:39:56,350 --> 00:40:00,220
they only need anywhere from 70 to 300
acres depending on what size plant they

636
00:40:00,221 --> 00:40:03,370
want to build. So they can blend,
build a lot more plants there.

637
00:40:03,371 --> 00:40:07,900
And I guess the quote on this one is
CMA or gms and then the farming Bisnar

638
00:40:08,260 --> 00:40:11,320
business Holister sheds.
So 1100 acres later,

639
00:40:11,590 --> 00:40:14,740
I guess there's hope in the community
that that means something for the future

640
00:40:14,741 --> 00:40:18,640
as well. And I know you guys are
getting a fantastic deal if you want to,

641
00:40:18,880 --> 00:40:21,700
if you go at us, a regular customer
on Amazon or what have you,

642
00:40:21,701 --> 00:40:22,750
it's a 30 buck deal,

643
00:40:22,751 --> 00:40:26,740
but you guys get it to a 15 and they
sell as it looks at two you may get a

644
00:40:26,741 --> 00:40:27,640
reimbursed as well.

645
00:40:27,640 --> 00:40:30,670
So it's a pretty cheap deal in the
sense of having her on your bookshelf or

646
00:40:30,671 --> 00:40:33,850
storyline. If I'd known Jason
was on the team back then,

647
00:40:33,851 --> 00:40:37,710
I would have dug up a Tommy.
So the signature in the
process as well, but Tommy's,

648
00:40:37,760 --> 00:40:41,740
it's again one of the testimonials on the
back page of or back cover rather have

649
00:40:41,741 --> 00:40:45,190
the book plus a few of the characters
like senators and other show.

650
00:40:45,580 --> 00:40:50,140
Thank you for indulging us if we will
take Q and a as you see fit from any of

651
00:40:50,141 --> 00:40:53,770
the five of us including territory
of course was instrumental in this,

652
00:40:53,771 --> 00:40:58,750
a message makers team to put this into
a documentary and so that's in in some

653
00:40:58,751 --> 00:41:00,700
way the surface level
of the business model.

654
00:41:00,701 --> 00:41:05,350
Let's nice 55 minutes to look at and
this is the more codafide version of the

655
00:41:05,351 --> 00:41:09,280
six dimensional framework that we're
hoping other communities can learn

656
00:41:09,281 --> 00:41:13,870
something form at least as a starting
point to solve similar problems and a

657
00:41:13,871 --> 00:41:15,700
complex format.
Thanks everyone.

658
00:41:17,080 --> 00:41:19,640
[inaudible]

659
00:41:29,240 --> 00:41:34,160
yeah,
GM has

660
00:41:34,160 --> 00:41:35,420
never before birth

661
00:41:39,950 --> 00:41:44,060
you swallow hard,
you put on a good face.

662
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:45,510
He,

663
00:41:45,510 --> 00:41:50,510
you begin gathering as much
information as you can to

664
00:41:52,730 --> 00:41:57,730
formulate a strategy and then you
articulate a plan and engage partners and

665
00:42:02,300 --> 00:42:06,530
begin the process of building trust.
Because without trust,

666
00:42:07,120 --> 00:42:08,210
it's not going to work.

667
00:42:09,350 --> 00:42:14,080
And this is going to be difficult
because you've got a fragmented region,

668
00:42:14,150 --> 00:42:15,080
three counties,

669
00:42:15,081 --> 00:42:20,020
and they're all competitors and there's
no history of collaboration. Uh,

670
00:42:20,050 --> 00:42:22,760
so it was going to be important that we,

671
00:42:23,420 --> 00:42:26,300
we incrementally bring people along.

672
00:42:26,870 --> 00:42:30,500
And I made a commitment very
early to the regional leaders.

673
00:42:30,770 --> 00:42:33,140
It must be a win win situation.

674
00:42:33,230 --> 00:42:37,400
And this is critical to the other
communities that are facing us.

675
00:42:37,820 --> 00:42:39,920
You bring your competitors to the table.

676
00:42:39,921 --> 00:42:44,570
So we invited the township leadership
to the table. We invited the chamber,

677
00:42:44,571 --> 00:42:47,220
the chamber in the law and the campaign,
when I ran from air,

678
00:42:47,221 --> 00:42:49,100
it didn't even give me an interview.
I mean,

679
00:42:49,101 --> 00:42:52,310
they endorsed my opponent without even
giving me an interview because I'd been

680
00:42:52,311 --> 00:42:55,760
such a Liberal Democrat for 20 years.
So I had an,

681
00:42:55,761 --> 00:42:57,590
I invited them to participate.

682
00:42:57,591 --> 00:43:02,591
I asked the chairman of the chamber to
be the public face of the Blue Ribbon

683
00:43:04,190 --> 00:43:07,430
Committee. So you're bringing
the diverse people together,

684
00:43:07,431 --> 00:43:10,310
you do a transparent process,
you commit to win, win,

685
00:43:10,880 --> 00:43:14,330
and then you begin problem solving.
Then part of that was getting data.

686
00:43:14,840 --> 00:43:18,260
We went to the University of Michigan and
Astra, I had George Fulton, who was, uh,

687
00:43:18,720 --> 00:43:23,120
a wizard and an expert in
a, uh, economic forecasting.

688
00:43:23,121 --> 00:43:27,990
And he had a metrics of
measuring a job impact by, uh,

689
00:43:28,220 --> 00:43:32,210
uh, uh, incentive packages
and, and uh, and that,

690
00:43:32,900 --> 00:43:37,070
and, um, George and his team, uh, uh,

691
00:43:37,240 --> 00:43:40,730
were credible beyond if we had gone
to Michigan state and got that data.

692
00:43:40,760 --> 00:43:43,490
People say, well, it's a homer
kind of a deal. You know,

693
00:43:43,491 --> 00:43:48,230
they're just covering themselves. But by
going to George Fulton and, and his, uh,

694
00:43:48,380 --> 00:43:53,120
national reputation,
and he documented that this plant,

695
00:43:53,150 --> 00:43:57,470
this hundred year old plant was
generating 2% of the wealth in Michigan.

696
00:43:58,130 --> 00:44:03,130
2% of our GM gross domestic product was
coming on to that 100 year old plant.

697
00:44:03,740 --> 00:44:07,250
And that if we could replace the plan,
we would have this much impact.

698
00:44:07,251 --> 00:44:09,010
And if we got to, we'd get this. And,

699
00:44:09,650 --> 00:44:14,090
and we took that data then and began
to educate the community about how

700
00:44:14,091 --> 00:44:15,860
important it was a general motors stay.

701
00:44:16,370 --> 00:44:21,150
And then we developed a strategy to
educate General Motors, uh, about, uh,

702
00:44:21,300 --> 00:44:25,890
the asset at that Labor represented
and that the community, um,

703
00:44:26,780 --> 00:44:31,700
brought in our DNA because we are
a collaborative, uh, group and,

704
00:44:31,710 --> 00:44:35,010
uh, and it slows us down as we knew
it was going to take time. This was,

705
00:44:35,160 --> 00:44:38,790
this plays out over about
a seven year period. Uh,

706
00:44:38,791 --> 00:44:42,660
the Blue Ribbon Committee that we had
actually functioned a as a formal group

707
00:44:42,661 --> 00:44:46,110
for five or six years. Um, but, um,

708
00:44:47,460 --> 00:44:51,750
to answer your question, you,
you just modeled ahead. I mean,

709
00:44:51,751 --> 00:44:54,630
we didn't have a great detailed plan,

710
00:44:55,260 --> 00:44:57,870
but I had been a legislator for 20 years.

711
00:44:58,470 --> 00:45:02,560
Probably the best training I had for the
task was teaching high school dropout.

712
00:45:02,561 --> 00:45:06,510
Try when I was a high school government
teacher prepared me well for working in

713
00:45:06,511 --> 00:45:10,760
the legislature. Uh, but it also
prepared me well for working in,

714
00:45:10,761 --> 00:45:14,910
in this kind of environment. Uh, because,
uh, when I was in the legislature,

715
00:45:14,911 --> 00:45:17,250
I was a chairman of the welfare budget.

716
00:45:17,300 --> 00:45:21,090
So every year I took a beating and trying
to get this budget passed and you're

717
00:45:21,091 --> 00:45:22,680
always putting together coalitions.

718
00:45:22,681 --> 00:45:26,550
You're always trying to get the budget
passed and this is the most political

719
00:45:26,551 --> 00:45:30,720
budget. Uh, so, um, I
chaired that for 16 years.

720
00:45:30,990 --> 00:45:32,620
He had the experience of

721
00:45:34,140 --> 00:45:38,070
bringing people who don't like each
other together and getting the focus on a

722
00:45:38,071 --> 00:45:41,910
common goal. So that's what we
did. It took time. Uh, but uh,

723
00:45:41,911 --> 00:45:43,530
it paid off in spades.

724
00:45:44,510 --> 00:45:47,420
I have one more question before I

725
00:45:49,200 --> 00:45:52,770
will physically here
rather than, um, you know,

726
00:45:52,790 --> 00:45:56,110
we'll go through the process of the book
when can see open challenge and he came

727
00:45:56,150 --> 00:45:58,490
up.
But here we have the living,

728
00:45:58,491 --> 00:46:02,570
breathing your body and then just
living and doing that day in, day out.

729
00:46:02,920 --> 00:46:06,330
So you're wasting your time.
You have a self,

730
00:46:06,360 --> 00:46:10,490
the challenge and the other one gets
thrown up for all of you personally,

731
00:46:11,030 --> 00:46:11,750
you know,

732
00:46:11,750 --> 00:46:16,750
how did you continue to dig deep and
find that passion to continue to problem

733
00:46:17,301 --> 00:46:21,450
solve? And that's something we, we
like to think we do at Google everyday.

734
00:46:21,480 --> 00:46:26,480
But you have a really big worlds example
of having done it an impact and so

735
00:46:27,870 --> 00:46:29,810
positively the lives of so many people.

736
00:46:29,860 --> 00:46:33,950
So it's nice to hear your
personal experiences of how
you dig deep and how you

737
00:46:34,100 --> 00:46:38,450
force yourself to do it. Right.

738
00:46:39,620 --> 00:46:44,370
Okay. I think my formal
training was as an engineer.

739
00:46:44,550 --> 00:46:47,610
I got my masters,
a bachelors and Masters at Michigan State.

740
00:46:48,220 --> 00:46:52,590
I was a civil engineer. Civil engineers
build roads, they build buildings,

741
00:46:52,591 --> 00:46:54,450
they get involved in all
kinds of different projects.

742
00:46:55,020 --> 00:46:57,540
So this was totally out
of character for me.

743
00:46:57,780 --> 00:46:59,880
I had never taken on a project like this,

744
00:47:00,390 --> 00:47:04,050
but the training that I had received
during the course of my career and the

745
00:47:04,051 --> 00:47:08,220
course of my college
education was problem solving.

746
00:47:08,880 --> 00:47:11,220
Engineers have to be problem solvers.
Uh,

747
00:47:11,470 --> 00:47:14,850
you folks are problem solvers
and that's what that's about.

748
00:47:14,880 --> 00:47:19,200
It's like you have to rely on all of your
experience and the folks that you have

749
00:47:19,201 --> 00:47:23,790
around you and the ability to dig deep.

750
00:47:24,070 --> 00:47:28,470
It's dig deep. I learned that
there was a, an equation for this.

751
00:47:28,500 --> 00:47:32,620
It's called five whys.
Why do you do this and why do you do that?

752
00:47:32,620 --> 00:47:33,840
And we'll dig down,

753
00:47:33,890 --> 00:47:37,540
drill down and keep drilling down
and eventually you get to a solution.

754
00:47:37,960 --> 00:47:38,950
And that's what we did.

755
00:47:40,630 --> 00:47:43,180
That's why I with the Terry
because I think Terry,

756
00:47:43,181 --> 00:47:47,100
I'm message makers all they do as being
innovative and creative. So great.

757
00:47:47,101 --> 00:47:50,490
I mean it's sort of part of his business
part I think. And give me a good story.

758
00:47:50,630 --> 00:47:54,560
Nope. Our task here was to help tell this
story and really what I wanted to say.

759
00:47:54,561 --> 00:47:56,210
I said, you know, you
have a few people here,

760
00:47:56,211 --> 00:48:00,350
but I was not involved
in the team that kept GM.

761
00:48:00,351 --> 00:48:01,340
I lived in the community,

762
00:48:01,341 --> 00:48:06,200
but our task was to retell that story
and Dave and ray came to me and said,

763
00:48:06,201 --> 00:48:10,300
you know that people are moving, passing
on whatever and we got to capture it. Uh,

764
00:48:10,450 --> 00:48:11,930
so we interviewed what 40,

765
00:48:11,931 --> 00:48:16,160
50 people they are in the documentary
there in the book and you get this,

766
00:48:16,370 --> 00:48:19,640
get that perspective on it and
not just ours but theirs as well.

767
00:48:19,641 --> 00:48:23,030
And it's pretty fascinating. And,
and I encourage you to look at it.

768
00:48:24,530 --> 00:48:27,580
Oh, it was important to me
if not winning or losing.

769
00:48:28,150 --> 00:48:32,020
The important thing is the integrity
you bring to the process and being

770
00:48:32,470 --> 00:48:36,970
transparent, being inclusive,
uh, being focused on when, when,

771
00:48:37,430 --> 00:48:39,880
uh, those were important that you
do, you're going to have setbacks,

772
00:48:39,881 --> 00:48:42,870
you're going to get, you're going
to have failures. So, you know,

773
00:48:43,160 --> 00:48:45,640
I couldn't undaunting task,
but uh,

774
00:48:45,641 --> 00:48:50,020
and I had joined motors telling me not
to do it, not to do, do it publicly.

775
00:48:50,540 --> 00:48:51,070
Uh,

776
00:48:51,070 --> 00:48:56,070
but if you create a process
that is transparent and
participatory and inclusive

777
00:48:58,361 --> 00:49:02,660
and focused on win win, then then
you can take those setbacks, uh,

778
00:49:02,770 --> 00:49:04,960
so that winning and
losing and not the issue,

779
00:49:04,990 --> 00:49:09,160
the issue is the integrity of the process
and the integrity you bring to the

780
00:49:09,161 --> 00:49:09,994
process.

781
00:49:10,800 --> 00:49:14,670
We as a book author, team method,
pretty much weekly for ever.

782
00:49:14,730 --> 00:49:19,730
It seems like to put this into code of I
for one and a transparency and trust or

783
00:49:20,640 --> 00:49:24,540
two words that these two guys brought
up every single freaking week.

784
00:49:24,570 --> 00:49:29,040
That had to be the mantra for
the storytelling. Not Trust
between us. That's fine.

785
00:49:29,041 --> 00:49:33,330
But transparency with the community in
the late 90 nineties telling them sort of

786
00:49:33,331 --> 00:49:37,530
what the, what they needed to know.
Perhaps not every single detail, but uh,

787
00:49:37,680 --> 00:49:40,290
the trust had to be built with the
community and all these parties

788
00:49:45,100 --> 00:49:46,850
as a by training is,

789
00:49:46,851 --> 00:49:51,410
is basically in supply chain and I'm a
Michigan Native and spent the last 20 or

790
00:49:51,470 --> 00:49:54,980
40 years of my life in Lansing.
So I had a really passion for,

791
00:49:55,010 --> 00:49:55,821
for the whole thing.

792
00:49:55,821 --> 00:50:00,821
And I think what really got me interested
in this is people were talking about,

793
00:50:02,450 --> 00:50:07,220
well Michigan is not relevant because our
labor costs are too high or what other

794
00:50:07,221 --> 00:50:11,930
excuses we had in terms of that and the
fact understanding supply chain and the

795
00:50:11,931 --> 00:50:15,230
fact there are a lot of trade offs.
And in this particular case,

796
00:50:15,560 --> 00:50:19,850
one of the key trade offs as
talent and labor and, and uh,

797
00:50:19,970 --> 00:50:24,350
getting people to understand that that
is not a trance transferable thing.

798
00:50:24,351 --> 00:50:26,870
You can just can't pick it up
and move it someplace else.

799
00:50:27,140 --> 00:50:31,750
One of the stories that came out of the
book is a lot of the Lansing workforce,

800
00:50:32,240 --> 00:50:35,750
our old farm boys.
And I'm not saying that negatively,

801
00:50:35,751 --> 00:50:36,890
I'm saying it was one point of view.

802
00:50:37,160 --> 00:50:39,610
These are the people
that make stuff work and,

803
00:50:39,760 --> 00:50:43,400
and that's one of the differentiators
in the plant that they keep the plant

804
00:50:43,401 --> 00:50:45,400
working because they,
they are,

805
00:50:45,401 --> 00:50:48,530
they have that hands on attitude
and telling that story was,

806
00:50:48,740 --> 00:50:50,270
was so very important to me.

807
00:50:51,360 --> 00:50:52,120
Okay.

808
00:50:52,120 --> 00:50:55,360
Beautiful. I'll take it back
then. Okay. I have a loud voice.

809
00:50:55,361 --> 00:50:59,840
That's what I was saying that, so, um,
you mentioned, uh, there was 40 other um,

810
00:50:59,890 --> 00:51:01,600
plants or we're looking to shut down.

811
00:51:01,601 --> 00:51:06,400
Did you find any other communities or
cities catch wind of what you are doing

812
00:51:06,401 --> 00:51:07,570
and you were public about it?

813
00:51:07,571 --> 00:51:11,320
Did they come to you guys to try and
mimic what you were trying to do and was

814
00:51:11,321 --> 00:51:12,550
anyone else successful?

815
00:51:18,910 --> 00:51:19,743
Okay.

816
00:51:20,010 --> 00:51:22,170
In some interesting way,
obviously.

817
00:51:22,470 --> 00:51:26,130
And I'm speaking for the two academics
a little bit because we'd been questing

818
00:51:26,310 --> 00:51:29,010
and part of the process is that
we quest in these guys too.

819
00:51:29,280 --> 00:51:33,300
So every chapter has a reflections by
ray Todd got shot in the reflections by

820
00:51:33,301 --> 00:51:38,300
the mayor so that they get to tell
their story in an I personality, uh,

821
00:51:38,350 --> 00:51:40,440
wording, if you will. Uh,

822
00:51:40,980 --> 00:51:44,310
but part of it was that General Motors
knew what everything that was going on,

823
00:51:44,311 --> 00:51:48,670
but they wanted to sign on
to an absolutely nothing
because in some way, uh,

824
00:51:48,810 --> 00:51:53,400
implicitly I think speaking on professor
close on myself as behalf myself behalf,

825
00:51:54,000 --> 00:51:56,400
I think they were supportive but there
were never going to sign onto it.

826
00:51:56,401 --> 00:51:58,650
So that question that you're
asking if other communities,

827
00:51:58,651 --> 00:52:01,170
what I've gotten wind of it and General
Motors had been even a little bit

828
00:52:01,171 --> 00:52:03,820
supportive.
They want to use large loads,

829
00:52:03,830 --> 00:52:07,560
the same blueprint when 40 out
of plants were being shut down.

830
00:52:07,561 --> 00:52:10,050
And not that that became
a competitive thing,

831
00:52:10,051 --> 00:52:13,980
but they were not going to say that this
is the perfect model to keep us do this

832
00:52:13,981 --> 00:52:16,710
in the future. And I think get
mayor Hollister throughout the work,

833
00:52:16,711 --> 00:52:18,600
through the aspect of it as well.

834
00:52:20,470 --> 00:52:25,470
[inaudible] president I macpherson of
Michigan State University took this model

835
00:52:25,701 --> 00:52:30,380
that we had developed and he as
he organized Michigan State's, uh,

836
00:52:30,890 --> 00:52:35,450
a strategy of attracting the
facility for rare isotope beams.

837
00:52:35,840 --> 00:52:37,400
This was a federal initiative,

838
00:52:37,401 --> 00:52:41,630
was a department of Energy
Program of $800 million.

839
00:52:42,140 --> 00:52:46,970
The competitor was a in Chicago and
was in the district cove out, uh,

840
00:52:47,540 --> 00:52:51,980
President Obama. So we were taking
on debt to win this competition,

841
00:52:52,420 --> 00:52:55,540
uh, an uphill battle. And, uh, he,

842
00:52:55,541 --> 00:53:00,400
he brought together a statewide
group of influential people. He, uh,

843
00:53:00,440 --> 00:53:04,850
I bought two macro Tom Board. We played
to our strengths, we engaged students,

844
00:53:05,480 --> 00:53:05,811
uh,

845
00:53:05,811 --> 00:53:10,811
and he was successful in bringing
this rare isotope facility to Msu.

846
00:53:12,170 --> 00:53:17,170
That was a model that it was directly
a pattern after what we did on a much

847
00:53:17,631 --> 00:53:22,550
larger scale.
Other communities can adopt this,

848
00:53:22,610 --> 00:53:25,650
but we haven't seen many
a most documentaries. Uh,

849
00:53:25,680 --> 00:53:28,560
ray and I looked at some
documentaries are a,

850
00:53:28,610 --> 00:53:32,460
the closing and the kind of looking
back what went wrong and you know,

851
00:53:32,490 --> 00:53:36,870
Janesville Wisconsin was one read
recently was on public television.

852
00:53:37,980 --> 00:53:42,390
We wanted to tell a story that
celebrated the fact that we, we,

853
00:53:42,420 --> 00:53:44,000
we won the battle,
uh,

854
00:53:44,310 --> 00:53:48,920
but also to document it and
kind of memorialize it and, and,

855
00:53:49,010 --> 00:53:53,830
and more importantly to educate
the millennials. Uh, what, uh,

856
00:53:53,860 --> 00:53:58,110
what, what's the, what's the foundation
upon which our current economy is built?

857
00:53:59,100 --> 00:54:03,810
Lansing is now much more diverse
in its economy. It has a,

858
00:54:03,811 --> 00:54:08,100
a vibrant it sector,
350 it firms.

859
00:54:08,580 --> 00:54:12,630
It's second only to Hartford, Connecticut
and insurance and finance headquarters.

860
00:54:13,080 --> 00:54:14,440
Uh, it is, uh,

861
00:54:14,441 --> 00:54:19,441
a high tech companies that are spinning
out of the cyclotron and the rare

862
00:54:20,761 --> 00:54:23,940
isotope, uh, beam, uh, effort. Uh,

863
00:54:23,941 --> 00:54:27,480
so we wanted these young people,
uh,

864
00:54:27,510 --> 00:54:32,510
like you're a employee employment base
to recognize that while the automobile

865
00:54:34,531 --> 00:54:37,170
industry represents the old economy,

866
00:54:37,650 --> 00:54:42,570
they also have been part of the transition
to the new economy. And, and Lansing,

867
00:54:42,571 --> 00:54:43,680
we didn't know it at the time.

868
00:54:43,680 --> 00:54:48,680
We were struggling with how to transform
from the old basic manufacturing with

869
00:54:49,231 --> 00:54:54,231
unskilled labor to the new economy
with advanced manufacturing and highly

870
00:54:55,621 --> 00:55:00,250
skilled labor. In fact, one of the
reasons we got the, uh, the f f Rib,

871
00:55:00,270 --> 00:55:05,270
the facility for a rare isotope beams
is the highly skilled workforce that the

872
00:55:05,401 --> 00:55:10,401
UAW had that could take a building that
they're building and design it and then

873
00:55:11,790 --> 00:55:15,210
modify it as it goes through the
process because it's a seven,

874
00:55:15,240 --> 00:55:19,440
eight year process of building the
building and you've got skilled enough

875
00:55:19,441 --> 00:55:21,770
workers that can make the adjustments and,
and,

876
00:55:21,771 --> 00:55:26,490
and a modified the building as the
science unfolds because it's the same

877
00:55:26,491 --> 00:55:30,480
dynamic. Uh, so that's kind of
a long answer to your question.

878
00:55:33,130 --> 00:55:35,680
One of the things that when
we started this process,

879
00:55:35,681 --> 00:55:38,710
we had no idea where we're going to go
or what we're going to do solving on the,

880
00:55:39,130 --> 00:55:43,930
on the run, so to speak, is there was
no manual out there that said, you know,

881
00:55:44,020 --> 00:55:47,920
go to page 27, you'll find out
how to do this or that. Uh,

882
00:55:47,950 --> 00:55:52,750
so we had to create this as we went,
but the success of what we did,

883
00:55:52,751 --> 00:55:55,720
now we've had communities call us and say,

884
00:55:55,721 --> 00:55:58,480
we'd like to kind of emulate your model.

885
00:55:59,620 --> 00:56:03,880
Can we do it over the phone?
No, you really can't. You know.

886
00:56:04,210 --> 00:56:08,800
So Dave was asked to go to Janesville
and I was asked to go to Janesville,

887
00:56:09,310 --> 00:56:12,010
but they didn't want,
you know, much promise.

888
00:56:12,011 --> 00:56:13,840
They thought we can
handle it over the phone.

889
00:56:13,841 --> 00:56:17,830
So they tried a little bit of the model.

890
00:56:18,460 --> 00:56:21,580
They didn't use the whole model
and as a consequence they failed.

891
00:56:22,060 --> 00:56:26,940
But they've reinvented. I mean I'm
happy for them because they'd become a,

892
00:56:27,280 --> 00:56:30,970
a central area for medical now,
uh,

893
00:56:30,990 --> 00:56:34,300
there between Milwaukee
and Chicago. So they, uh,

894
00:56:34,330 --> 00:56:38,770
have attracted a significant
business area there. At any rate,

895
00:56:38,771 --> 00:56:43,360
other communities have tried to do
something similar, but most have failed.

896
00:56:43,870 --> 00:56:48,870
Now that we've put the model in
writing and thanks to David and Thomas,

897
00:56:49,320 --> 00:56:54,320
we were able to do that in a way that
would make sense to other communities and

898
00:56:54,731 --> 00:56:58,060
make sense to students as they read this.
Uh,

899
00:56:58,061 --> 00:57:00,160
so we're grateful for the opportunity.

900
00:57:00,550 --> 00:57:05,550
The last thing I want to add is that
this effort ended up being a $3 billion

901
00:57:07,240 --> 00:57:11,470
plus investment in the Lansing
region since we started this process.

902
00:57:11,740 --> 00:57:16,000
That doesn't include all the suppliers.
So there is a huge,

903
00:57:16,001 --> 00:57:21,001
huge amount of investment here and to
saving over 70,000 jobs in the state of

904
00:57:21,011 --> 00:57:21,844
Michigan.

905
00:57:25,890 --> 00:57:27,210
Thank you.
Thank you.

906
00:57:29,320 --> 00:57:34,320
You're in front of you today and that
will hear your story and online and

907
00:57:36,430 --> 00:57:41,430
congratulations on contribution.
Thank you.

908
00:57:41,840 --> 00:57:42,140
Thank you.
