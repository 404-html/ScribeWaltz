1
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:10,260
Hey everybody. Hi. Thanks for having
me. Do you guys have a good lunch? Yeah,

2
00:00:10,261 --> 00:00:14,310
me too. I'm telling you I want to work
here cause that lunch was awesome. Um,

3
00:00:14,910 --> 00:00:16,500
I don't make anything near that.
Anyways,

4
00:00:16,501 --> 00:00:19,110
my name is Matthew Reinhardt
and I make poppop books.

5
00:00:19,770 --> 00:00:22,200
Some people call me a paper engineer's,
some people call me.

6
00:00:22,450 --> 00:00:24,360
I'm a children's book illustrator.
I'm,

7
00:00:24,630 --> 00:00:27,300
I like to think of myself as
all those things and many more.

8
00:00:27,600 --> 00:00:32,490
And today I'm going to show you a little
bit about, you know, how I do what I do.

9
00:00:32,550 --> 00:00:37,550
I'm also going to make a pop up here
and show you some things that you can

10
00:00:37,801 --> 00:00:42,750
actually make it home to. Um,
so let's get started. Say Hello.

11
00:00:42,780 --> 00:00:46,650
See, I always have to put notes
for myself in these presentations.

12
00:00:46,920 --> 00:00:50,280
It helps me a lot. Um, when I'm doing
this and I say hello and get started.

13
00:00:50,280 --> 00:00:55,230
So we got that done. All right, very
good. All right. So, um, when I was young,

14
00:00:55,231 --> 00:01:00,231
I had no idea that there was such a thing
as a paper engineer or a pop up book

15
00:01:00,571 --> 00:01:03,940
maker, whatever. I was just a kid.
I liked to ride bikes, you know,

16
00:01:04,170 --> 00:01:08,850
my fashion sense was a little
off. Um, but, but I, but I
didn't know and you know,

17
00:01:08,851 --> 00:01:10,020
you guys are really lucky.

18
00:01:10,140 --> 00:01:12,670
Everyone's really lucky to be
able to come here and you know,

19
00:01:12,690 --> 00:01:16,050
be with your parents and uh,
see what they do at work.

20
00:01:16,051 --> 00:01:19,210
It's really important as you
get older, you get to, you,

21
00:01:19,240 --> 00:01:23,070
you get to learn about what things work
and what things you will for you and

22
00:01:23,071 --> 00:01:24,820
what things you might like to do as a job.
Mother,

23
00:01:24,850 --> 00:01:28,640
the things you may not like to do. So,
uh, like growing up, like, you know,

24
00:01:28,650 --> 00:01:31,830
my parents did different things and
you know, I'd go to work with them.

25
00:01:32,550 --> 00:01:35,910
Here is my mother was an aerobic
instructor. There I am in the background.

26
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:40,150
If you can see really,
and yes,

27
00:01:40,170 --> 00:01:44,470
it was the 80s, you know. Okay.
It's not my fault. All right. Um,

28
00:01:44,490 --> 00:01:48,480
my dad was a dentist. Here I am at
the dentist. I'm helping my dad.

29
00:01:49,830 --> 00:01:53,970
He only let me use that drill
once though. I, yeah. But anyways,

30
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:57,990
I looked good and strong in scrubs,
but I'm seriously though,

31
00:01:58,110 --> 00:02:03,000
I'm telling a little bit about myself.
Okay. So not for the jokes. Uh,

32
00:02:03,660 --> 00:02:07,420
okay. So I have always
sort of, uh, growing up, I,

33
00:02:07,620 --> 00:02:10,410
my dad was in the navy. We
lived all over the place. Um,

34
00:02:10,470 --> 00:02:14,430
the one thing that I always took with
me was a artwork. So I always drew,

35
00:02:14,431 --> 00:02:17,070
I always made stuff, you know, they're
there. I am in that corner there.

36
00:02:17,071 --> 00:02:20,340
When I was really young, writing
my first book, um, it was a novel.

37
00:02:20,340 --> 00:02:25,140
It took me forever, you
know. Uh, but, um, you know,

38
00:02:25,141 --> 00:02:29,070
I was always making things. I was just
drawing and I was, and, and, and, uh,

39
00:02:29,160 --> 00:02:32,640
creating things with my hands,
uh, because that was the,

40
00:02:32,760 --> 00:02:36,450
that was what could come with me if I
didn't have friends in a new space or,

41
00:02:36,451 --> 00:02:38,940
you know, if I, it was, uh, we had moved,

42
00:02:40,320 --> 00:02:44,460
my artwork always came with me. So I spent
a lot of time by myself making things.

43
00:02:44,461 --> 00:02:48,420
And when, when I was young, you know,
there were no Michael's stores. So, um,

44
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:52,260
you know, getting supplies to make this
stuff wasn't, wasn't always as easy.

45
00:02:52,261 --> 00:02:56,160
So I was always rummaging through the
garbage or, you know, anything extra,

46
00:02:56,161 --> 00:02:59,070
making things out of box
of cereal boxes, um, uh,

47
00:02:59,470 --> 00:03:04,300
styrofoam from any sort of, uh,
electronic that we ever got. I was always,

48
00:03:04,301 --> 00:03:07,780
you know, buying are grabbing the
boxes and making stuff out of it.

49
00:03:07,930 --> 00:03:10,390
If there was a toy that I,
that didn't exist,

50
00:03:10,391 --> 00:03:13,030
I would make it myself out
of whatever I could. Um,

51
00:03:13,031 --> 00:03:15,890
right there you see a picture
of me with my little sister. Um,

52
00:03:16,060 --> 00:03:21,060
I think I made a little cardboard puppetry
stage and as usual my sister would

53
00:03:21,401 --> 00:03:24,490
destroy it, you know, within a few
seconds she would come over, oh,

54
00:03:24,491 --> 00:03:28,480
this is great rep, you know?
So that was kind of, um,

55
00:03:29,140 --> 00:03:32,020
what it was like, ah,
this is a drawing I did,

56
00:03:32,021 --> 00:03:36,550
I think back in first grade and I've
always had an interest in biology and

57
00:03:36,551 --> 00:03:41,340
zoology and paleontology. I love
dinosaurs. I love, you know,

58
00:03:41,500 --> 00:03:45,790
but I really just loved making artwork
and kind of telling stories with pictures.

59
00:03:46,450 --> 00:03:48,670
As you can see. Also, I was
a little bit of an EGOMANIAC.

60
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:53,110
My name is really big up in the corner
and I think that's kind of translated

61
00:03:53,111 --> 00:03:57,950
into, you know, myself now. Um,
but, uh, so, uh, it was, uh, it,

62
00:03:58,060 --> 00:04:02,530
but being an artist really wasn't a viable
option, at least when I was younger,

63
00:04:02,710 --> 00:04:04,200
uh, for a career. I,

64
00:04:04,390 --> 00:04:08,950
at the time we didn't have the Google
and we couldn't go online and figure out,

65
00:04:09,160 --> 00:04:11,380
you know, do our research
so easily. You know,

66
00:04:11,381 --> 00:04:15,940
we had to go to those things called
libraries and things and we would go and I

67
00:04:15,941 --> 00:04:19,300
didn't know as much about all the
creative jobs that are out there,

68
00:04:19,301 --> 00:04:23,250
all the ways that you can sort of
channel that creative energy and that,

69
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:25,300
that talent.
Um,

70
00:04:25,570 --> 00:04:29,750
and so when I went off
from, uh, high school, uh,

71
00:04:29,760 --> 00:04:33,040
I didn't have a lot of motivation.
I mean, really, I, I, uh, to, to,

72
00:04:33,070 --> 00:04:37,060
to find out what I could do. My parents
didn't want me to be a starving artist.

73
00:04:37,210 --> 00:04:40,270
They use that a lot all the time.
We don't want you to be a starving artist,

74
00:04:40,271 --> 00:04:42,850
you know? Um, and uh,

75
00:04:43,210 --> 00:04:48,100
so I went to school for my college
years and I studied biology.

76
00:04:48,101 --> 00:04:49,950
My, my, uh, I actually, uh,

77
00:04:50,230 --> 00:04:54,860
my undergraduate degree is in biological
sciences and it was going to be a

78
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:57,650
doctor. I studied premed. Uh,

79
00:04:57,920 --> 00:05:02,350
I went to Clemson University
for my undergraduate degree.
Um, and you can see me,

80
00:05:02,351 --> 00:05:05,230
I think I'm up in the corner
there. I'm somewhere. Anyway,

81
00:05:05,231 --> 00:05:08,560
so I went to Clemson the entire time I
was there though while I was studying all

82
00:05:08,561 --> 00:05:12,970
these biology and chemistry
and biochemistry, which is
horrible if you've ever,

83
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:16,000
biochemistry is the worst. Um, after I,

84
00:05:16,001 --> 00:05:19,390
when I was studying all these different
things, I, I felt something like,

85
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:21,970
I felt like it wasn't quite right.
I mean,

86
00:05:21,971 --> 00:05:24,280
I was interested in it and
it was pretty good at it.

87
00:05:24,281 --> 00:05:27,910
And actually I got into medical
school, but, but I just,

88
00:05:28,690 --> 00:05:32,320
it wasn't right. So the whole
time I was doing all this science,

89
00:05:32,860 --> 00:05:35,650
I was also doing artwork on the side.
I was always doing sketches.

90
00:05:35,651 --> 00:05:39,090
I was always making these giant
paintings of weird things. Um,

91
00:05:39,430 --> 00:05:44,430
and I wanted to see if there was a way I
could apply that and some of my science

92
00:05:45,071 --> 00:05:48,220
skill, uh, to a job. But I
just didn't know at the time.

93
00:05:49,030 --> 00:05:51,040
So before I went to med school,
like I said,

94
00:05:51,041 --> 00:05:54,820
I got in before I went to school and be
a doctor, which is a long haul, you know,

95
00:05:54,821 --> 00:05:58,430
it's, you, there's a lot that goes into
it. My parents were really pushing for it.

96
00:05:58,770 --> 00:06:01,880
Um, I told him, listen, I need that. I
want a year off before I go to school.

97
00:06:01,881 --> 00:06:05,300
And then went to live in
New York City and um, oop,

98
00:06:05,301 --> 00:06:09,930
that one went before this one. Let's see.
Well, so I lived in New York City. That's,

99
00:06:09,960 --> 00:06:14,570
that's the apartment that we lived in,
down in, um, on canal street. Actually.

100
00:06:14,571 --> 00:06:18,230
We had rats like this big,
I swear to God. Um, it was,

101
00:06:18,231 --> 00:06:20,750
it was a really cool space that
we lived in, but he actually,

102
00:06:20,930 --> 00:06:22,490
we lived over a stereo store,

103
00:06:22,610 --> 00:06:27,550
so like from noon til about
seven at night. The, the,

104
00:06:27,580 --> 00:06:32,000
the vibrations from the stereos downstairs
would move our furniture so they,

105
00:06:32,001 --> 00:06:36,110
everything would shake. Um, and during
that time, and I lived in New York City,

106
00:06:36,380 --> 00:06:40,760
I worked for an organization that
helped find corneas for people who have

107
00:06:40,761 --> 00:06:43,670
trouble with their eyes.
And I worked with a lot of hospitals,

108
00:06:43,671 --> 00:06:48,350
so I was getting an idea of what it was.
It was like to work with sick people.

109
00:06:48,351 --> 00:06:51,140
And I realized I didn't like
working with sick people.

110
00:06:51,230 --> 00:06:54,980
I didn't know it was a good idea for
me to work as a doctor if I didn't like

111
00:06:54,981 --> 00:06:59,540
doing that. It was really hard and it was
really scary. And so while I was here,

112
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:02,240
you know, I came to that
realization. And then I also,

113
00:07:02,360 --> 00:07:05,720
New York is a really exciting,
creative place. I mean,

114
00:07:05,721 --> 00:07:08,750
there's all kinds of people
doing all kinds of weird jobs.

115
00:07:09,110 --> 00:07:11,800
Things that you would never know existed.
And while I was,

116
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:16,550
while I was in New York at that time,
and this was about 25 years ago,

117
00:07:16,910 --> 00:07:21,880
um, back back when, you know, the Times
Square was not filled with, you know,

118
00:07:21,890 --> 00:07:24,800
lots of Disneyland like lights and
everything. It was a lot different.

119
00:07:24,801 --> 00:07:28,490
I'm not going to go into that. Um, but uh,

120
00:07:29,330 --> 00:07:31,400
I also was meeting a lot of people who
are doing a lot of different kinds of

121
00:07:31,401 --> 00:07:33,410
jobs and a lot of different
kinds of creative jobs.

122
00:07:33,770 --> 00:07:37,340
And so I ended up going to my
parents and saying, listen,

123
00:07:37,341 --> 00:07:40,370
this is not something I want to do. I
don't want to be a doctor. You know,

124
00:07:40,610 --> 00:07:45,500
I really want to do something creative.
And shockingly, they told me, okay,

125
00:07:46,100 --> 00:07:46,933
you can do that,

126
00:07:47,390 --> 00:07:49,940
but you have to find something
where you're really able
to live because we ain't

127
00:07:49,950 --> 00:07:53,460
paying for your forever.
And so I did my research and I,

128
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:58,840
I discovered that there is something
called industrial design and that is the

129
00:07:58,881 --> 00:08:01,070
design of products,
all kinds of products,

130
00:08:01,071 --> 00:08:05,060
whether they be tables
or scissors or you know,

131
00:08:05,061 --> 00:08:09,230
like cool Nike shoes or even toys, you
know, that you get like action figures.

132
00:08:09,231 --> 00:08:11,720
I'm a big action figure
collector actually. Um,

133
00:08:11,721 --> 00:08:14,210
I have a huge star wars figure collection,

134
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:19,240
like 2000 different star wars figures
and I've been collecting since 78 so I

135
00:08:19,281 --> 00:08:22,880
have a lot and I also collect transformers
and you'll see a little bit of that

136
00:08:23,030 --> 00:08:25,040
trickle into the work I do.
Um,

137
00:08:25,100 --> 00:08:28,160
I have a huge transformer collection
now here in New York City.

138
00:08:28,190 --> 00:08:31,790
We don't have a lot of space so I can't
have like a transformers room in my

139
00:08:31,791 --> 00:08:34,550
apartment. I have a
transformer closet, but um,

140
00:08:34,610 --> 00:08:37,910
thank goodness for offsite storage
because that's where the rest of my

141
00:08:37,911 --> 00:08:41,810
collection goes. Anyways, I
studied industrial design at,

142
00:08:41,840 --> 00:08:46,570
let's see if it picture comes up. Pratt
Institute, which is in Brooklyn. And I,

143
00:08:46,790 --> 00:08:47,840
I,
I took a grad,

144
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:51,140
I did the graduate program
at Pratt Institute study
there for a couple of years.

145
00:08:51,290 --> 00:08:54,920
And while I was there, I, um,

146
00:08:55,610 --> 00:08:59,130
let's see if that other picture comes
up. There it is. It's New York. Well,

147
00:08:59,131 --> 00:09:01,330
I already told you I was in New York.
Um,

148
00:09:02,760 --> 00:09:06,000
while I was there I worked
with a gentleman who, uh,

149
00:09:06,090 --> 00:09:10,560
he needed some help making popups and I
was his intern and I just needed like an

150
00:09:10,561 --> 00:09:13,020
extra job to make some money,
you know, it was okay, you know,

151
00:09:13,021 --> 00:09:15,690
I could cut up and full paper, whatever,
you know, it wasn't a big deal.

152
00:09:15,690 --> 00:09:17,970
I didn't really even think about popups.
In fact,

153
00:09:18,180 --> 00:09:22,820
growing up I only had one pop
up book and this was it. Um,

154
00:09:23,250 --> 00:09:27,870
this dinosaur's obviously and
it was beautiful illustration
and when you open it

155
00:09:27,871 --> 00:09:31,890
up, there's a pop up and it's a
little different than, you know,

156
00:09:31,891 --> 00:09:33,390
from some of the ones that I do.
You know,

157
00:09:33,420 --> 00:09:36,300
I do kind of a little bit
more elaborate ones like this,

158
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:39,730
but we'll get, get in there. Um,

159
00:09:40,650 --> 00:09:41,910
but I really loved it.

160
00:09:41,940 --> 00:09:46,940
Now this pop up ended up after it was
in my household for a little while,

161
00:09:47,850 --> 00:09:49,650
probably about an hour or so.
It looked like,

162
00:09:51,180 --> 00:09:52,013
like

163
00:09:52,190 --> 00:09:53,023
this

164
00:09:54,410 --> 00:09:58,430
because of one person in the house.

165
00:09:59,390 --> 00:10:02,960
So I really didn't think about popups.
It was never in my mind

166
00:10:03,130 --> 00:10:04,090
anything like that.

167
00:10:08,510 --> 00:10:13,140
That's really, yeah. Yeah. Uh, so papa was
worrying in my mind, but I would help. I,

168
00:10:13,160 --> 00:10:16,250
I, when I was younger and
when I was in Grad School,

169
00:10:16,251 --> 00:10:20,330
I was helping this paper
engineer and you know,

170
00:10:20,930 --> 00:10:23,960
I would cut in full paper and follow
his instructions. And you know,

171
00:10:23,961 --> 00:10:28,500
it was a long time. I worked for him a
couple of years just doing this. And, and,

172
00:10:28,610 --> 00:10:31,840
and when I got to school,
I realized that maybe this is a,

173
00:10:32,120 --> 00:10:35,630
maybe this is something I can
do. And so there was a lot. So,

174
00:10:35,631 --> 00:10:39,740
so for quite a few years I apprenticed
and what that really means is I worked

175
00:10:39,741 --> 00:10:41,660
and I would help him with his work.

176
00:10:41,840 --> 00:10:44,240
And it wasn't always the
stuff I wanted to do. In fact,

177
00:10:44,420 --> 00:10:48,440
the designs I didn't always like,
even though he did really beautiful work,

178
00:10:50,280 --> 00:10:51,113
like,

179
00:10:52,080 --> 00:10:54,270
um, I worked with Robert Buddha, um,

180
00:10:54,280 --> 00:10:56,890
for many years and he
does a lot of very white,

181
00:10:56,950 --> 00:11:00,850
beautiful structural popups and stuff.
We worked on things for like the Moma and,

182
00:11:01,090 --> 00:11:05,500
and all kinds. And I'm an other
publishers. I learned a lot from,

183
00:11:05,590 --> 00:11:08,350
from just learning how
structurally how this stuff,

184
00:11:08,500 --> 00:11:11,890
but it wasn't always this stuff
that I wanted to do myself.

185
00:11:12,220 --> 00:11:15,070
But that's really important in the
beginning when you're learning something,

186
00:11:15,220 --> 00:11:19,990
sometimes you've got to do the work and
it isn't always exactly what you want to

187
00:11:19,991 --> 00:11:21,460
do,
but it helps you learn.

188
00:11:21,910 --> 00:11:25,540
So after years of learning all these
different principles and learning all this

189
00:11:25,541 --> 00:11:30,510
stuff, how to make popups, I was, I
got to start doing my own books. Um,

190
00:11:31,240 --> 00:11:33,790
some of the, the first two books
I did were, weren't like these,

191
00:11:33,940 --> 00:11:35,350
they were these really weird books,

192
00:11:35,351 --> 00:11:37,900
the pop up book of Phobias and
the public will get nightmares.

193
00:11:38,170 --> 00:11:41,770
They were these bizarre books. I never
even thought they'd actually come out. Um,

194
00:11:41,771 --> 00:11:45,450
but, but actually the phobia book was
really popular, especially with, um,

195
00:11:45,730 --> 00:11:47,260
with therapists in the city.

196
00:11:50,170 --> 00:11:54,370
Then I was able to start making books that
I really, really was about. Um, I had,

197
00:11:54,430 --> 00:11:59,230
uh, I, my first New York Times bestseller
was a pop up book of butterflies.

198
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:03,790
And after that we were able to create a
series about prehistoric animals cause I

199
00:12:03,791 --> 00:12:05,110
love paleontology.

200
00:12:05,320 --> 00:12:08,330
First was this dinosaur book and
called Encyclopedia Pre Historica.

201
00:12:08,710 --> 00:12:13,180
And this has been translated now into
about 25 different languages around the

202
00:12:13,181 --> 00:12:17,650
world. And doing this project, you know,
it says I collaborate on these books,

203
00:12:17,651 --> 00:12:20,950
I collaborated Roberts to Buddha.
He would just sort of oversee things,

204
00:12:20,951 --> 00:12:22,930
but I would,
I would do the writing,

205
00:12:23,050 --> 00:12:26,320
the artwork and the right
and the engineering. So all,

206
00:12:26,620 --> 00:12:30,610
all parts of making a pop up book,
we made three in this series.

207
00:12:30,940 --> 00:12:31,773
And when you make,

208
00:12:32,200 --> 00:12:35,980
when you're just starting out and you're
making these big books, you learn a lot.

209
00:12:36,040 --> 00:12:38,590
Boy, you learn a lot, but
you make a lot of mistakes.

210
00:12:38,950 --> 00:12:43,420
And each book I look at it and I
see a lot of mistakes. In fact,

211
00:12:43,480 --> 00:12:46,810
I can't always enjoy my books when they're
finished because all I do is go, Oh,

212
00:12:46,811 --> 00:12:48,730
you could've done that better.
Oh, that wasn't that good.

213
00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:52,840
But a lot of other people don't know
that. So, um, you know, Aye, I, yes,

214
00:12:52,841 --> 00:12:54,670
I go to a therapist
about this sort of stuff.

215
00:12:55,840 --> 00:12:59,740
So I did this series and then
let's see what else we got.

216
00:13:00,010 --> 00:13:01,570
I've done a lot of books about,
you know,

217
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:05,680
a classic stories and fairy tales
like Cinderella and the jungle book,

218
00:13:05,681 --> 00:13:10,570
which was really awesome. I love that.
That one, I did a series about mythology.

219
00:13:10,571 --> 00:13:15,420
So I love learning about like things like
mythology and history and science and,

220
00:13:15,480 --> 00:13:20,350
and um, I like, I kind of have one of
those mines where I'm obsessive surprise.

221
00:13:20,620 --> 00:13:24,850
Um, like I, I get obsessive
about this subject, so when
I want to learn something,

222
00:13:25,090 --> 00:13:27,790
I just don't want to learn a little.
I got to learn a lot.

223
00:13:28,420 --> 00:13:30,400
And what happens though,
when you do that,

224
00:13:30,401 --> 00:13:31,930
especially when you're
creating books like this,

225
00:13:32,200 --> 00:13:36,760
you have only so much space in
this, in this, uh, biological
computer in your head.

226
00:13:37,090 --> 00:13:39,340
And so when I learned something else,

227
00:13:39,430 --> 00:13:42,550
it kind of pushes the old stuff
out and the new stuff goes in.

228
00:13:42,820 --> 00:13:45,720
So I learned stuff and then,
you know, it pushes all stuff.

229
00:13:45,730 --> 00:13:48,730
So thank God I still know how to
walk and talk because you know,

230
00:13:48,731 --> 00:13:51,190
like I've learned so much about
all these different subjects.

231
00:13:51,400 --> 00:13:54,130
So this is mythology, this series,
the gods in here, a book is,

232
00:13:54,131 --> 00:13:56,890
that's actually pretty cool.
There's a lot of fun to do.

233
00:13:57,640 --> 00:13:59,770
I did a book with Maurice
Sendak at one point.

234
00:13:59,771 --> 00:14:01,690
Maurice Sendak did where
the wild things are.

235
00:14:02,080 --> 00:14:05,470
This pop up book was called
Mommy and it was about it.

236
00:14:05,471 --> 00:14:06,700
It barely had any words in it,

237
00:14:06,850 --> 00:14:09,820
but it was about a baby who
went into a mad scientist lab.

238
00:14:09,940 --> 00:14:13,910
And of course in in more
racist world, the baby, uh,

239
00:14:13,960 --> 00:14:15,970
defeats all the monsters in funny ways,

240
00:14:15,971 --> 00:14:20,290
like pulling down their pants and doing
fun stuff like that. Which of course,

241
00:14:20,410 --> 00:14:25,300
I mean it makes total sense. I also,
like I said, really loves star wars. Now,

242
00:14:25,330 --> 00:14:27,580
I'm an old school star wars fan.

243
00:14:27,970 --> 00:14:32,970
And so I did the first book for the 30th
anniversary of the original star wars

244
00:14:33,191 --> 00:14:36,550
trilogy. And that's awesome. This
year is the 40th anniversary.

245
00:14:36,551 --> 00:14:39,790
So that book is 10 years old. Um,
it was incredible. It was the,

246
00:14:40,150 --> 00:14:44,110
it was a huge dream come true. It was a
dream and it was a nightmare, you know,

247
00:14:44,111 --> 00:14:49,111
making it so I'm so obsessive that I
had to get everything just right that I

248
00:14:49,121 --> 00:14:52,640
actually put myself in that
book as a character. Um,

249
00:14:52,641 --> 00:14:55,700
so it was fun to be able to do that
and put some of my friends, in fact,

250
00:14:55,760 --> 00:14:59,990
a lot of times and some of them in my
books, I do put family and friends,

251
00:15:00,200 --> 00:15:03,470
even pets, um, that I used to have.
In fact in my Cinderella book,

252
00:15:03,471 --> 00:15:06,980
my pet rabbits from when I was a kid
are following Cinderella throughout the

253
00:15:06,981 --> 00:15:08,770
book. Uh, because, um,

254
00:15:09,140 --> 00:15:13,400
everyone wants to learn about Lucy
Bernadine and fuzzball my pet rabbits from

255
00:15:13,401 --> 00:15:14,510
when I was,
when these young,

256
00:15:15,570 --> 00:15:18,650
I also do the second star wars book and
I'll probably do a third star wars book

257
00:15:18,651 --> 00:15:21,260
once we're finished with the new trilogy.
I can't wait.

258
00:15:22,490 --> 00:15:24,800
I love comic books.
Uh,

259
00:15:24,801 --> 00:15:29,330
and especially at DC comics I
did to a superhero books so far,

260
00:15:29,331 --> 00:15:31,580
but there may be another big
marvel one coming in the future.

261
00:15:31,700 --> 00:15:35,420
I actually got to work with six different
comic book artists for this book.

262
00:15:35,660 --> 00:15:39,540
It was awesome to be able to create
it and actually has a light up. Um,

263
00:15:39,620 --> 00:15:42,950
some of my books have light up
parts and then I what they call my,

264
00:15:42,980 --> 00:15:44,930
my type of a work paper engineering,

265
00:15:45,050 --> 00:15:49,400
they call it low tech engineering
cause I'm only working with one type of

266
00:15:49,401 --> 00:15:52,880
material paper. But sometimes I
use other things like electronics.

267
00:15:52,881 --> 00:15:56,390
So in this book and in the Star Wars book,
there are electronics,

268
00:15:56,420 --> 00:15:58,370
like as a matter of fact,
like at the end of the star wars book,

269
00:15:58,550 --> 00:16:01,550
here's Darth Vader now
and it's at the top,

270
00:16:02,180 --> 00:16:05,480
there are two working lights and now
you can't tell what the lights in here,

271
00:16:05,870 --> 00:16:09,560
but that lightsaber that Luke has lights
up. And then on the opposite side,

272
00:16:09,561 --> 00:16:10,520
the Darth Vader windows.

273
00:16:10,940 --> 00:16:13,340
So there's actually wires that
go in underneath the page.

274
00:16:13,341 --> 00:16:15,800
I wished the lights weren't so bright,
but you would be able to see that better.

275
00:16:16,100 --> 00:16:20,000
But anyways, it's been cool to be
able to create things like that.

276
00:16:20,860 --> 00:16:25,550
And then this one has a bat signal that
lights up. It's super cool. Um, yes,

277
00:16:25,551 --> 00:16:29,510
I'm a Brownie. I totally made
a pony book. It was awesome.

278
00:16:29,840 --> 00:16:33,890
And I can't wait for the big movie. What's
cool about working with Milo ponies?

279
00:16:33,910 --> 00:16:37,550
I in this book, I actually got
to make myself a pony. Um, uh,

280
00:16:37,760 --> 00:16:42,760
my pony name is professor of paper
scraps and I dare you to find me in this,

281
00:16:43,280 --> 00:16:46,580
in this book. I'm somewhere in one of
the backgrounds. So it was really cool.

282
00:16:46,581 --> 00:16:50,180
I love the, I, my sister loved my
little pony when we were young,

283
00:16:50,390 --> 00:16:55,390
but the new pony show is awesome and I
was forced to watch all of them and it

284
00:16:55,911 --> 00:17:00,290
was great. It was great. I love
it. It was really fun. I did.

285
00:17:00,380 --> 00:17:03,200
Sometimes I try to do books
where they aren't just a book.

286
00:17:03,201 --> 00:17:03,891
There's something else.

287
00:17:03,891 --> 00:17:08,330
This book was for the game of
Thrones and it not only becomes,

288
00:17:08,690 --> 00:17:12,560
it's not only a popup book about all the
different places in the game of Thrones,

289
00:17:12,561 --> 00:17:15,410
in Westeros and everything,
it also becomes a giant map.

290
00:17:15,440 --> 00:17:19,070
It's about as big as a table. So
you can enjoy it both ways. Um,

291
00:17:19,071 --> 00:17:21,500
some people say like,
it's important to think outside the box.

292
00:17:21,530 --> 00:17:25,550
I like to say it's important to
think outside the book. And I'm,

293
00:17:25,551 --> 00:17:29,900
so there are a lot more projects that are
coming up that we're trying to stretch

294
00:17:29,901 --> 00:17:34,340
the boundaries of what a pop up book can
be or just what a book can be and how

295
00:17:34,341 --> 00:17:35,450
it can be interactive.

296
00:17:39,160 --> 00:17:44,090
Um, I also like to express
my feminine side and I, uh,

297
00:17:44,130 --> 00:17:48,680
Eh, I am big into princesses. Okay.
So, um, and I'm cool with that.

298
00:17:48,920 --> 00:17:53,400
I'm cool with that. All right, so I've
done, um, to Disney princess books.

299
00:17:53,401 --> 00:17:55,800
One was of course frozen
because let me tell you,

300
00:17:55,801 --> 00:17:58,980
when Disney calls you up and they say,
would you like to do a fro?

301
00:17:59,010 --> 00:18:03,030
You don't even let them finish the
word you say. Yes, yes, I will. Um,

302
00:18:03,060 --> 00:18:07,560
I worked on the frozen book. I let me
tell you, I didn't stop singing that song.

303
00:18:07,620 --> 00:18:10,340
I like to hear it in my sleep
and I let it go. You know,

304
00:18:10,350 --> 00:18:12,990
I would hear it all the time,
but it was, it was great.

305
00:18:12,991 --> 00:18:14,240
It was really fun to work on.

306
00:18:14,241 --> 00:18:18,900
And I also worked on a Disney princess
book cause I love a classic animation.

307
00:18:19,040 --> 00:18:21,750
Um, and so many of those
Disney princess movies,

308
00:18:21,960 --> 00:18:24,750
especially things like Cinderella and uh,
well I was,

309
00:18:24,751 --> 00:18:27,900
I'm my personal favorite is
a little mermaid. Um, those,

310
00:18:27,930 --> 00:18:31,830
those movies like really transformed
the artists that I am today.

311
00:18:31,831 --> 00:18:33,990
So they were really big influences.

312
00:18:33,991 --> 00:18:37,500
And so do you to work on that
and to make like Cinderella,

313
00:18:37,501 --> 00:18:42,420
super cool that Cinderella actually,
she transforms. So she's like, Oh,

314
00:18:42,421 --> 00:18:46,230
I'm all sad, Cinderella. And then you
pull the bottom of her skirt thing.

315
00:18:46,440 --> 00:18:47,273
You don't pull your skirt,

316
00:18:47,310 --> 00:18:51,210
but there's a little tab on the bottom
and it transforms into like Super Fab,

317
00:18:51,640 --> 00:18:55,830
a Cinderella. So it was really
cool. That was a hard pop to design.

318
00:18:59,610 --> 00:19:02,970
Let's see
here we go

319
00:19:06,330 --> 00:19:07,163
here.

320
00:19:07,190 --> 00:19:10,040
Oh, oh. Well of course, in
one of my most recent books,

321
00:19:10,190 --> 00:19:13,160
something I know that everyone
here at Google loves Lego.

322
00:19:13,460 --> 00:19:16,370
So a couple of years ago the Lego
folks came to me and they said,

323
00:19:16,371 --> 00:19:17,590
would you want to do a Lego?

324
00:19:17,720 --> 00:19:21,800
And I didn't even let them finish that
sentence either. Um, yes, totally.

325
00:19:21,801 --> 00:19:26,510
I grew up building with Lego.
Uh, but back when I was young,

326
00:19:26,511 --> 00:19:28,550
we didn't have all the cool
sets that you guys have now.

327
00:19:28,760 --> 00:19:33,560
We just had like whatever, six colors
and I think we had wheels maybe.

328
00:19:33,770 --> 00:19:37,010
Um, but it was, we never,
when you would make something,

329
00:19:37,011 --> 00:19:40,430
it never looked like one object. It
always just kind of look like, you know,

330
00:19:40,431 --> 00:19:42,110
a bunch of different
bricks stuck together.

331
00:19:42,230 --> 00:19:45,560
Whereas now you have so many
different pieces. It's, I actually,

332
00:19:45,650 --> 00:19:47,150
when I was researching this book,

333
00:19:47,151 --> 00:19:52,151
I tried to get the Lego people to tell
me a number of all the different pieces

334
00:19:52,821 --> 00:19:54,740
that they've ever made,
you know, not color,

335
00:19:55,010 --> 00:19:58,070
but then the types of pieces and
they couldn't even give it to me.

336
00:19:58,220 --> 00:20:00,560
There's so many different pieces.
They don't even have a number for that.

337
00:20:00,920 --> 00:20:03,230
So when I worked on this
book, I actually, uh,

338
00:20:03,260 --> 00:20:06,740
went to the Lego headquarters
in Billund in Denmark.

339
00:20:06,920 --> 00:20:09,890
I went to their special
like design headquarters,

340
00:20:09,891 --> 00:20:11,900
which is this big white
like sort of vague,

341
00:20:11,901 --> 00:20:13,460
I think they call it the
white box or something.

342
00:20:13,730 --> 00:20:18,550
And I can't tell you what was
in there, but it was awesome.
It was awesome. And um,

343
00:20:19,040 --> 00:20:22,100
it's really like,
there's such artists that work there.

344
00:20:22,101 --> 00:20:26,240
It's incredible how they figure out
how to make these beautiful things with

345
00:20:26,241 --> 00:20:29,210
these little plastic brick. It's,
it's, it's, it's an, it's incredible.

346
00:20:29,211 --> 00:20:33,920
So working on this book, my research was
really tough. I mean they had to, like,

347
00:20:33,980 --> 00:20:38,840
they sent me like 200 different Lego
sets and I, you know, built Legos.

348
00:20:38,841 --> 00:20:43,140
It was really hard. Yeah. Actually, I
got a couple of interns to help me. Um,

349
00:20:43,280 --> 00:20:45,950
because it takes a while. I mean, I
know that some of the parents here know,

350
00:20:45,951 --> 00:20:49,840
like when you get those, you know, you
get those sets, like it takes a while,

351
00:20:49,841 --> 00:20:51,220
especially when they're those big ones.

352
00:20:52,270 --> 00:20:55,690
So we built everything and then
we made the uh, then, you know,

353
00:20:55,691 --> 00:20:57,460
made the pops and then made the artwork.

354
00:20:58,240 --> 00:21:00,850
Here's a little sample of what's inside,

355
00:21:02,940 --> 00:21:04,090
like a pop up.

356
00:21:04,890 --> 00:21:09,420
And I did the writing, the popups
and the art in this. Um, yeah,

357
00:21:09,421 --> 00:21:12,030
and there are, there are cool
pops in this, that transform,

358
00:21:12,180 --> 00:21:14,400
this one transforms into
three different things.

359
00:21:14,540 --> 00:21:17,880
And then there's tons of mini figures
and all kinds of cool things. That's my,

360
00:21:17,910 --> 00:21:21,420
that's my assistant there.
Works in Ninjago too. Um,

361
00:21:22,200 --> 00:21:26,520
and it has this huge pop in it that is
super tall. It's this big tall tower. Uh,

362
00:21:26,550 --> 00:21:29,790
pops. Actually we're going to have
a giveaway of some books later on.

363
00:21:29,910 --> 00:21:34,230
So think in your mind about like some,
some cool lego facts,

364
00:21:34,560 --> 00:21:36,870
just thinking in your head and
we'll get back to that later on.

365
00:21:38,250 --> 00:21:43,170
So in Fra see notes, know, tell Tom.
Okay, so his is how I do what I do.

366
00:21:45,860 --> 00:21:50,560
All right. When I work in my office
down in the West Village, um,

367
00:21:50,800 --> 00:21:54,790
all I do is I stick paper in the
machine and Papa books come out.

368
00:21:54,910 --> 00:21:57,490
That's how I do it. All right,
I'm ready. I'll see you later. No,

369
00:21:57,580 --> 00:22:02,200
actually that's not what I do. Don't you
love my angry face in that picture too?

370
00:22:02,201 --> 00:22:05,320
I was like [inaudible]
that's not how it's done.

371
00:22:05,321 --> 00:22:06,880
It's actually a really long process.

372
00:22:06,881 --> 00:22:11,870
Making a pop up book sometimes takes
from like four to six months and uh, to,

373
00:22:11,900 --> 00:22:13,810
to make a whole book from
the beginning to the end.

374
00:22:14,050 --> 00:22:18,970
And then most of that work has to be
done about eight months before it's

375
00:22:18,971 --> 00:22:22,240
actually on the shelves.
Because after I make one book,

376
00:22:22,540 --> 00:22:26,320
there has to be a whole group of people
that helped me make thousands more.

377
00:22:26,620 --> 00:22:31,240
So here's how it's done
first. Do you know,

378
00:22:31,241 --> 00:22:34,090
of course, uh, I have to get ideas
for things. I have to get inspiration.

379
00:22:34,091 --> 00:22:35,650
I look all around me.

380
00:22:35,651 --> 00:22:39,760
I look at the world everywhere and try
to take inspiration from anything I can

381
00:22:39,761 --> 00:22:42,430
see. Or you know, you're lucky
that you guys are in New York.

382
00:22:42,431 --> 00:22:45,370
There's so much here and I think
most of the pictures that are here,

383
00:22:45,371 --> 00:22:48,490
I took in New York. Um, there's so much,

384
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:50,770
there's so much to see and,

385
00:22:51,130 --> 00:22:54,010
but I think that you can be
anywhere and be inspired by things.

386
00:22:54,130 --> 00:22:57,910
So I take inspiration from,
from everywhere and um,

387
00:22:58,030 --> 00:23:00,910
sometimes you can see the way that some
things built and that might inspire you

388
00:23:00,911 --> 00:23:02,650
to make something really
cool in a pop up book.

389
00:23:04,470 --> 00:23:08,670
So the tools I use making popups of
course, after I've written the story,

390
00:23:09,390 --> 00:23:10,650
let's see.

391
00:23:12,110 --> 00:23:16,820
Okay, paper. Yeah, I use a lot of card
stock. I usually work in white card stock.

392
00:23:16,821 --> 00:23:19,730
This is it right here. You can get it.
It's a little heavier than regular paper.

393
00:23:19,731 --> 00:23:21,980
You can get it like the
office stores and everything.

394
00:23:21,981 --> 00:23:25,220
And the reason why I use it in white
is first I want to figure out what the

395
00:23:25,221 --> 00:23:29,180
structure is and then I worry about
coloring it or drawing on it or whatever.

396
00:23:29,300 --> 00:23:33,080
So usually in the beginning I
just work in white paper. Um,

397
00:23:33,081 --> 00:23:36,320
I of course use a tape.
I use different kinds of tape.

398
00:23:36,860 --> 00:23:39,560
I you said lots of scissors,
glue,

399
00:23:39,670 --> 00:23:41,960
[inaudible] glue and exacto knife.

400
00:23:41,961 --> 00:23:46,630
The exacto knife I use to make really
intricate cuts and I need lots of bandaids

401
00:23:46,670 --> 00:23:51,350
cause I don't just make cuts on the
paper. I yes, I like Hello Kitty.

402
00:23:51,410 --> 00:23:52,243
Okay,

403
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:55,833
let's see.

404
00:23:56,670 --> 00:23:59,760
So at the beginning, this is kind
of what the rough pop up looks like.

405
00:23:59,850 --> 00:24:04,290
I may have an idea for what is going to
happen on that popup page. Just words.

406
00:24:04,291 --> 00:24:08,580
I will never like draw a picture of
what I'm going to make. I usually, uh,

407
00:24:08,670 --> 00:24:11,760
I just have a word of what might happen.
So I just thought to myself,

408
00:24:11,761 --> 00:24:15,630
I wanted to have a pop up that
uh, the dinosaur bit, the reader.

409
00:24:15,631 --> 00:24:18,450
I thought that'd be really fun because
if you were going to experience a t rex,

410
00:24:18,451 --> 00:24:20,520
like that would be the coolest way to,
well,

411
00:24:20,521 --> 00:24:22,170
I mean you wouldn't
really want to be eaten,

412
00:24:22,200 --> 00:24:23,760
but it would be cool if
they kind of came at you.

413
00:24:24,030 --> 00:24:27,330
So this is the first version and
I'll take it apart very carefully.

414
00:24:27,450 --> 00:24:31,230
Trace the pieces in the computer using
Adobe illustrator and I'll you make what

415
00:24:31,231 --> 00:24:34,620
are called dye lines and these guidelines
are going to be used later on for when

416
00:24:34,621 --> 00:24:37,110
they manufacture this
thousands of times over.

417
00:24:37,230 --> 00:24:42,230
So I will remake the pop up sometimes
up to 10 times or even 20 times,

418
00:24:43,090 --> 00:24:47,910
um, to make sure that it works just right
when you can see there's even notes on

419
00:24:47,911 --> 00:24:50,820
that and everything and that's
what it looks like in the final.

420
00:24:51,060 --> 00:24:54,390
Now one of the things that I
also make the artwork as well,

421
00:24:54,391 --> 00:24:55,800
and I'll show you how I do that as a,

422
00:24:55,801 --> 00:24:58,830
also I do a style of artwork
called cut paper collage.

423
00:24:58,980 --> 00:25:00,630
So I'm cutting up paper to make the pops.

424
00:25:00,780 --> 00:25:04,230
I thought it'd be cool to also cut
up paper to make the artwork as well.

425
00:25:06,120 --> 00:25:08,130
Oh, in the beginning, this is
where the pop up looks like.

426
00:25:08,190 --> 00:25:10,530
This is just this get
the movement right now.

427
00:25:10,620 --> 00:25:15,000
I actually went and studied a horse and
how it moved and this was going to be a

428
00:25:15,001 --> 00:25:18,920
book. This book never actually came
out. Oh, well anyways. Um, why don't,

429
00:25:18,930 --> 00:25:23,080
why don't you buy for you? Uh, it wasn't
that exciting. I swear. I swear it's not.

430
00:25:23,250 --> 00:25:27,270
So this is, um, an early prototype that
actually had sketches on it. This is,

431
00:25:27,300 --> 00:25:30,660
this is something that's called,
um, uh, white dummy and it,

432
00:25:30,780 --> 00:25:32,310
it goes to the,

433
00:25:32,540 --> 00:25:36,180
my editor now the editor works at a
publisher and she kind of corrects all my

434
00:25:36,181 --> 00:25:36,421
work.

435
00:25:36,421 --> 00:25:40,620
She kind of imagine it's like your
teacher and she actually goes through and

436
00:25:40,621 --> 00:25:41,460
marks things that are,

437
00:25:41,670 --> 00:25:44,670
that are written wrong or she may have
been mark some of the pops and say,

438
00:25:44,671 --> 00:25:46,830
I don't think that this is a
good thing that you should do,

439
00:25:46,900 --> 00:25:48,960
should do something else. So she'll, um,

440
00:25:49,080 --> 00:25:51,840
and just like a teacher or
she marks it in red, you know,

441
00:25:51,990 --> 00:25:54,540
so it's great when you get that back.
But usually I don't get,

442
00:25:54,600 --> 00:25:59,570
I do okay with my editors and usually
they're, they're on the same. Um, they,

443
00:25:59,590 --> 00:26:04,470
they're on the same page. So this bigger,
uh, I didn't mean to do that. I'm sorry.

444
00:26:04,680 --> 00:26:08,010
Um, as me, when we're making
popups and this is just, you know,

445
00:26:08,011 --> 00:26:10,950
show you some of the details that
growing up go into making it,

446
00:26:13,380 --> 00:26:15,120
this is an early version
of the Darth Vader pop.

447
00:26:15,121 --> 00:26:17,680
This was a really tough
pop up to make because, um,

448
00:26:17,820 --> 00:26:20,970
there's two portions of Darth Vader's
helmet. There's a, well, there's actually,

449
00:26:21,140 --> 00:26:23,790
there's, there's three, there's,
I don't want to get into it,

450
00:26:23,940 --> 00:26:26,730
I'm not going to get into it,
but there's anyways, what,

451
00:26:26,760 --> 00:26:29,500
what happens with this
is actually you could,

452
00:26:29,580 --> 00:26:33,240
I wanted the reader to be able to see
Anna can for a couple of seconds before

453
00:26:33,241 --> 00:26:36,540
the mass closed up over and when
the popup open. So you can actually,

454
00:26:36,570 --> 00:26:39,870
if you look as it's opening, it's
really important. Like the time,

455
00:26:39,900 --> 00:26:44,280
you can see him for a second and
then it closes over his face.

456
00:26:44,850 --> 00:26:48,120
Cause because everyone makes,
everyone notices those little things.

457
00:26:48,300 --> 00:26:50,360
So this took me a long time to be,

458
00:26:50,580 --> 00:26:54,750
and I had to actually engineer the front
part of his face separately than the

459
00:26:54,751 --> 00:26:57,000
back and then put them together.
So it took a lot,

460
00:26:57,420 --> 00:27:01,020
a lot of time and a lot of prototypes
to get it. You even look like this.

461
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:01,681
So you see,

462
00:27:01,681 --> 00:27:06,510
I've kind of sculpted it and white first
and then their sketches around it and

463
00:27:06,511 --> 00:27:10,920
then, and then, and then,

464
00:27:11,460 --> 00:27:15,480
oh, that's the wrong thing. And then,
then that's the final color version.

465
00:27:17,040 --> 00:27:20,160
When I was doing this book I actually,
which was awesome. I got, you know,

466
00:27:20,161 --> 00:27:22,950
I do get some perks when I work with
some of these, uh, different, uh,

467
00:27:22,970 --> 00:27:25,970
companies and things.
I got to go to this star wars archives.

468
00:27:25,971 --> 00:27:29,490
So this was the Lucas film
archives in Marin County.

469
00:27:29,580 --> 00:27:31,350
This was actually at the Skywalker ranch.

470
00:27:31,351 --> 00:27:33,330
They don't even let people
go here anymore. So I,

471
00:27:33,331 --> 00:27:34,940
I got in there at the right time.
Um,

472
00:27:35,250 --> 00:27:37,380
and they had all the
masks from the old movies.

473
00:27:37,381 --> 00:27:40,860
Those are actual stunt light
sabers. That's my, my editor and I,

474
00:27:41,080 --> 00:27:44,100
and we're getting ready to fight about
something and those are stunt library

475
00:27:44,130 --> 00:27:45,020
lightsabers from him.

476
00:27:45,240 --> 00:27:49,170
And the matte painting in
the back is actually used
from the empire strikes back.

477
00:27:49,620 --> 00:27:50,730
Um,
so I am like,

478
00:27:50,760 --> 00:27:54,840
I couldn't stop smiling after this was
so much fun to go see and you know,

479
00:27:54,870 --> 00:27:57,330
did I need to go? I remember
when my editor says, Oh,

480
00:27:57,331 --> 00:28:00,090
do you think you're going to need to go
to the Lucas archives to look at things

481
00:28:00,240 --> 00:28:05,070
now I know. Let me do it. At the time
I owned hundreds of star wars books,

482
00:28:05,100 --> 00:28:09,030
I had every movie, you know, I have
tons. I knew everything about it.

483
00:28:09,250 --> 00:28:11,370
Of course it was like, yes, I
think, I think I should probably go.

484
00:28:11,460 --> 00:28:12,890
So I was able to go.
It was,

485
00:28:12,960 --> 00:28:16,020
it was an awesome experience and I've
had a lot of Nice experiences like that.

486
00:28:16,290 --> 00:28:18,600
Like the big fan in me gets
to go do these cool things.

487
00:28:19,140 --> 00:28:22,680
This is me working in my student,
not this fast. I, this is, yeah,

488
00:28:22,860 --> 00:28:25,950
this is me working in the studio probably
over a few hours and I'm designing a

489
00:28:25,951 --> 00:28:29,760
pop up and as you can
see it's just by hand.

490
00:28:29,790 --> 00:28:32,040
There's no computer program.
The computer program,

491
00:28:32,041 --> 00:28:36,870
it comes in when I actually take the pop
apart and trace it now after I've made

492
00:28:36,871 --> 00:28:37,800
all those dye lines,

493
00:28:37,801 --> 00:28:41,720
all those lines that are tracings of
pieces I may go in and make artwork

494
00:28:41,730 --> 00:28:42,780
sometimes isn't the computers,

495
00:28:42,790 --> 00:28:47,160
sometimes it's by hand and I put the
artwork and those dialogues together

496
00:28:47,670 --> 00:28:50,850
rebuild the pop up again and
again to make sure it works.

497
00:28:51,030 --> 00:28:55,020
And that is how a popup was made.
This was for the transformers pop up book.

498
00:28:55,021 --> 00:28:58,430
Like I said, I love transformers
that um, that was just a,

499
00:28:58,431 --> 00:29:02,520
a quick pop up, how to
make, um, for that book.

500
00:29:02,550 --> 00:29:04,470
That was an incredible book to do as well.

501
00:29:04,770 --> 00:29:07,800
I have a lot of dream projects that
come true. People always ask me,

502
00:29:07,920 --> 00:29:10,710
you must not have any more dreams laugh.
I be like, let me tell you. I've got lots.

503
00:29:10,740 --> 00:29:14,750
There's always something else that I
wanted to do. I have a lot of dreams. Um,

504
00:29:15,270 --> 00:29:18,750
this is just a prototype of what the
book looks like before it was in color.

505
00:29:20,190 --> 00:29:23,520
And um, sometimes I do the artwork and
sometimes other people do the art work.

506
00:29:23,521 --> 00:29:25,990
Like I said, I worked with
Maurice Sendak once. Um,

507
00:29:26,010 --> 00:29:28,410
and then for this book I
actually worked with, um,

508
00:29:28,470 --> 00:29:32,880
a great transformer artist name
Ameliana Ameliana no, centrally.

509
00:29:33,030 --> 00:29:36,120
He lives in Italy. I actually never got
to see him the whole time we worked over,

510
00:29:36,330 --> 00:29:39,300
you know, we just send things back and
forth to each other over the Internet.

511
00:29:39,510 --> 00:29:43,990
And I would draw the sort of sketch and
what he should draw and made all kinds

512
00:29:43,991 --> 00:29:46,630
of notes about what, where and
where, what it should look like.

513
00:29:47,110 --> 00:29:49,810
And then he would make the art and then
I would put that with those dieline

514
00:29:49,811 --> 00:29:50,171
pieces.

515
00:29:50,171 --> 00:29:53,290
So you can see like sometimes for one
pop up there might be like 30 different

516
00:29:53,291 --> 00:29:56,370
pieces that work in tandem.
All these different levers and,

517
00:29:56,560 --> 00:29:58,960
and different mech
mechanics working together.

518
00:30:00,310 --> 00:30:02,860
Or there may be other times
when I make the artwork myself,

519
00:30:02,890 --> 00:30:05,770
now I think about making
a pop up. Um, okay,

520
00:30:05,771 --> 00:30:08,180
so there's three different stages and
making pop up. You have to have the,

521
00:30:08,210 --> 00:30:09,820
you have the writing done,
you know,

522
00:30:09,821 --> 00:30:13,540
and the reason we'd ever research and
writing, um, that's like a cake. You know,

523
00:30:13,541 --> 00:30:15,940
when you're making cake,
that's the recipe or you got to have that.

524
00:30:15,941 --> 00:30:17,950
The next step is the actual cake.
You know,

525
00:30:17,951 --> 00:30:19,790
you're actually going to
bake something. So, um,

526
00:30:19,930 --> 00:30:21,370
the next step is actually making the cake.

527
00:30:21,371 --> 00:30:25,650
And then the artwork is the
frosting to me. I love frosting. Um,

528
00:30:25,780 --> 00:30:28,270
so making color artwork.
Now I said I use,

529
00:30:28,570 --> 00:30:32,940
I make a style called a cut paper
collage and I actually by hand, uh,

530
00:30:33,610 --> 00:30:35,950
make all these different types of art.
Sometimes it's digital,

531
00:30:35,951 --> 00:30:39,340
but usually it's by hand. I, I take all
these papers that I've made in my studio,

532
00:30:39,341 --> 00:30:43,120
all these different textures. I have a
huge rack of different new papers that,

533
00:30:43,150 --> 00:30:46,840
that we're constantly using. And I will,
uh, I will show you how a little bit,

534
00:30:46,841 --> 00:30:50,530
how it's done.
First I'll draw a picture.

535
00:30:51,640 --> 00:30:53,640
I'm just very quickly,
uh,

536
00:30:54,030 --> 00:30:58,390
it's usually tighten up a sketch
and then I'll use that sketch as my,

537
00:30:58,570 --> 00:30:59,141
as my,

538
00:30:59,141 --> 00:31:03,760
I'm sort of map and I'll cut out sections
of different colored paper with my

539
00:31:03,761 --> 00:31:04,594
exacto knife.

540
00:31:06,180 --> 00:31:06,420
Okay.

541
00:31:06,420 --> 00:31:10,920
I'll lay it in the place using my sketch
sort of as a guide and I printed on a

542
00:31:10,921 --> 00:31:12,650
clear piece of plastic.
Um,

543
00:31:12,900 --> 00:31:15,330
then I'll glue in the different
pieces of colored paper.

544
00:31:17,250 --> 00:31:19,980
And the glue I use is very similar
to Elmers glue, White Glue.

545
00:31:20,340 --> 00:31:22,770
And then that's what the
final thing will look like.

546
00:31:22,771 --> 00:31:24,390
And it's a very small piece of artwork,

547
00:31:25,200 --> 00:31:28,230
but it may have 20 different little pieces
of paper all glued together. Make one.

548
00:31:28,560 --> 00:31:33,240
Sometimes some of my larger
pieces, um, may have, uh, you know,

549
00:31:33,241 --> 00:31:35,100
hundreds of pieces of
paper glued together.

550
00:31:35,670 --> 00:31:38,550
When I make the artwork for the pop
up pieces, it's a little different.

551
00:31:38,551 --> 00:31:42,090
I have to make the artwork
like all splat it out and like,

552
00:31:42,091 --> 00:31:45,980
it's almost looks like a, it's like pop
up road kill, you know, like they're,

553
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:50,400
they're offside. There's pieces here and
there. Um, and, and after so many years,

554
00:31:50,401 --> 00:31:54,090
I figured out where each piece needs to
be or what needs to be on what's piece,

555
00:31:54,091 --> 00:31:58,090
cause sometimes the head isn't
necessarily connected to the body. So, um,

556
00:31:58,770 --> 00:32:00,840
I figured it out after a long time.
But you know,

557
00:32:00,880 --> 00:32:03,840
they're the one thing I don't
really say, do you guys, uh,

558
00:32:03,870 --> 00:32:07,980
it didn't say that earlier was that there
are a lot of mistakes along the way.

559
00:32:08,010 --> 00:32:11,100
I don't just start out and
have the perfect idea first.

560
00:32:11,430 --> 00:32:14,940
And it all looks great for
every wow pop up that you see.

561
00:32:15,160 --> 00:32:18,900
There's a lot of not so
wows that get thrown out.

562
00:32:19,590 --> 00:32:23,580
And that's the way I figure things
out. You know, I, I sort of,

563
00:32:24,240 --> 00:32:27,240
I will make something and see if
it's something I like. If it's not,

564
00:32:27,600 --> 00:32:30,270
then I try something different and that's,
you know,

565
00:32:30,330 --> 00:32:32,310
hopefully you guys can get from this.

566
00:32:32,580 --> 00:32:36,360
It doesn't come out perfect and it's
okay because we're supposed to learn from

567
00:32:36,361 --> 00:32:40,370
our mistakes and I've made saw many
of them you wouldn't even know.

568
00:32:41,330 --> 00:32:45,950
And it's okay to do that cause that's
how we get better. Well, so, okay.

569
00:32:45,950 --> 00:32:48,620
So I've made one pop up,
I've made all the art,

570
00:32:48,650 --> 00:32:52,970
I've made all the pops and I may
all the words. Now what do I do?

571
00:32:52,971 --> 00:32:57,800
So I send all that and I send one
pop up book that I made by hand to a

572
00:32:57,801 --> 00:32:58,950
manufacturer and the manufacturer,

573
00:32:58,960 --> 00:33:01,490
they're actually pop pop up
books or hand manufactured.

574
00:33:01,910 --> 00:33:05,570
Once I make one pop up book, um, I uh,

575
00:33:05,600 --> 00:33:09,510
the next step is sending all
that information to uh, uh,

576
00:33:09,610 --> 00:33:14,240
a printer and a hand assembly,
a manufacturer. And um, uh,

577
00:33:14,241 --> 00:33:17,870
so that's all sent. Usually
the work is done overseas. Um,

578
00:33:18,080 --> 00:33:20,210
and I've worked with a lot of
these manufacturers for years,

579
00:33:20,211 --> 00:33:22,520
so they understand how to
put together popups. In fact,

580
00:33:22,730 --> 00:33:27,320
they're more of experts than assembling
popups then than I could ever be.

581
00:33:27,321 --> 00:33:29,630
And they tell me things, this
doesn't work. This will work.

582
00:33:29,780 --> 00:33:30,950
Here's some ideas about things.

583
00:33:31,250 --> 00:33:35,180
So what they'll do is they'll break down
the book and into different groups and

584
00:33:35,210 --> 00:33:37,880
one group will make
just one page of a book.

585
00:33:38,180 --> 00:33:42,320
And I'm so each person they'll remake,
we used person,

586
00:33:42,321 --> 00:33:46,430
we'll make one section of, so
for example, if this ad ad here,

587
00:33:46,431 --> 00:33:50,360
one person will assemble this leg and
handed off to the next person and there

588
00:33:50,361 --> 00:33:53,470
will be a large group that just works
on this page and they'll make thousands.

589
00:33:53,471 --> 00:33:58,250
Sometimes it can make up, they're like
15,000 a week. Um, they're really hand,

590
00:33:58,280 --> 00:34:01,640
they're really incredibly
skilled hand laborers and they,

591
00:34:01,760 --> 00:34:06,110
they oftentimes come up with ideas that
are way better than what I come up with.

592
00:34:06,111 --> 00:34:10,310
So I work the entire time during that
production, which is usually, like I said,

593
00:34:10,311 --> 00:34:13,760
about eight months before in a book,
hits the shelves.

594
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:17,210
So they'll send me prototypes and then
once they actually start building the

595
00:34:17,211 --> 00:34:22,190
books, they can, you know,
make up to 15,000 a week.
They'll package them up, um,

596
00:34:22,191 --> 00:34:24,650
after they've made each spread,
they'll, they'll glue them together.

597
00:34:24,651 --> 00:34:28,100
Then the little cover on it though,
I'm clamp them, let them dry,

598
00:34:28,101 --> 00:34:31,580
and then they will get shipped
off in boxes all over the world.

599
00:34:31,790 --> 00:34:36,790
So it's kind of goes from my hands
creating the original book to the

600
00:34:36,951 --> 00:34:41,300
manufacturer's hands, to your hands
in the, in, um, in the bookstores.

601
00:34:41,301 --> 00:34:42,950
So it's really,
it's really too cool.

602
00:34:42,951 --> 00:34:47,180
But there are a lot of products that we
don't realize are made by hand when they

603
00:34:47,181 --> 00:34:51,620
are. There isn't like some giant machine
that will do all this work for us.

604
00:34:51,621 --> 00:34:54,110
You know, there's some really
intricate things that we, um,

605
00:34:54,440 --> 00:34:58,670
that we have and that we buy and
there are hands that go into it.

606
00:34:59,420 --> 00:35:03,920
So now I'm going to show you,
now that I've talked about myself enough,

607
00:35:04,370 --> 00:35:05,090
uh,

608
00:35:05,090 --> 00:35:10,090
we're going to make a pop right here and
I'm going to show you some basics and,

609
00:35:10,101 --> 00:35:11,420
um,
but I,

610
00:35:11,570 --> 00:35:15,590
but I'm going to need an idea
for what I should make. Now,

611
00:35:15,591 --> 00:35:20,591
last time someone came up
with a really crazy idea and,

612
00:35:21,200 --> 00:35:24,650
um, I've, I did it of course, but, uh,

613
00:35:26,240 --> 00:35:29,060
it was something, it was pretty
funny. So a, anyone got an idea?

614
00:35:29,061 --> 00:35:33,800
You want to raise your hand and
I'll take, let's see. Let's see.

615
00:35:33,890 --> 00:35:37,950
Okay. Yes, plants.

616
00:35:38,700 --> 00:35:41,580
Okay. That works well. I like this green.

617
00:35:41,581 --> 00:35:44,160
So I'm gonna use that for
the actual plants, I think.

618
00:35:44,430 --> 00:35:46,260
So what I'm going to start
with is just this card stock.

619
00:35:46,261 --> 00:35:47,580
I'm going to fold it in half.

620
00:35:49,210 --> 00:35:50,010
Okay.

621
00:35:50,010 --> 00:35:53,550
Oh, I've already got an idea. Oh, oh, oh,

622
00:35:54,630 --> 00:35:58,630
oh yeah. So, okay, we're
gonna start off. This is,

623
00:35:58,850 --> 00:36:03,660
we took a piece of paper and we folded in
half just like that. All right. And um,

624
00:36:04,170 --> 00:36:07,110
just for the sake of being
able to see it on video,

625
00:36:07,111 --> 00:36:11,070
I'm going to make a line down the
center so it's a little easier to see.

626
00:36:11,071 --> 00:36:15,120
So you see that center line we're going
to, when we make some of our pieces,

627
00:36:15,300 --> 00:36:16,380
we're going to align it.

628
00:36:16,381 --> 00:36:20,100
We're gonna line up the folds on things
cause that's a lot of pop up people.

629
00:36:20,101 --> 00:36:22,950
Do they like line up different folds
to make sure things work right?

630
00:36:23,400 --> 00:36:24,690
So one of the things,

631
00:36:24,691 --> 00:36:29,430
I'm going to make something called a
beef fold and the Vif old is actually,

632
00:36:29,580 --> 00:36:34,070
well, it's shaped like a v
and most of the popups in,

633
00:36:34,160 --> 00:36:38,430
in most of my books use some form of
Vif fold. Um, that's not a good one.

634
00:36:38,970 --> 00:36:42,690
Okay, see this, see this
big dinosaur, see, see this,

635
00:36:42,870 --> 00:36:46,080
this piece underneath his body here

636
00:36:47,820 --> 00:36:50,580
that,
and it's sort of like triangular and v.

637
00:36:51,060 --> 00:36:53,670
So that's a v and you
can see that it moves.

638
00:36:53,970 --> 00:36:56,430
It actually is forcing all
these pieces to move up.

639
00:36:56,880 --> 00:37:00,210
So a vehicle moves.

640
00:37:00,390 --> 00:37:03,960
And so what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna
Make Two v folds and I'm gonna Make Two v

641
00:37:03,961 --> 00:37:07,110
folds that that are,
they're both right angles,

642
00:37:07,111 --> 00:37:11,820
right angles are 90 degree
angles, right? Um, correct.

643
00:37:11,970 --> 00:37:16,260
I mean. Correct. Uh, so let's
see here. I'm to take a piece of,

644
00:37:16,290 --> 00:37:20,220
I'm going to take a different piece
would say gray so that you can see these

645
00:37:20,221 --> 00:37:23,190
pieces. And what I'm gonna do
is I'm going to make, first,

646
00:37:23,191 --> 00:37:25,650
I'm going to make a square,
a small square out of paper,

647
00:37:25,651 --> 00:37:28,500
and then I'm going to make two
triangles from that square.

648
00:37:30,090 --> 00:37:30,710
Yeah.

649
00:37:30,710 --> 00:37:35,190
And you say, Matthew, how can
that be done? I just don't
know. Well, okay, so right.

650
00:37:35,210 --> 00:37:39,080
I just folded the rectangle
right now. Correct. I mean,

651
00:37:39,110 --> 00:37:41,360
because if I say right angle,
it's, it's very confusing.

652
00:37:41,570 --> 00:37:46,220
So then I'm going to fold
this triangle down like this

653
00:37:50,100 --> 00:37:50,933
and

654
00:37:52,240 --> 00:37:53,470
I'll be able to see,

655
00:37:54,730 --> 00:37:57,430
I cut it along the edge like that.

656
00:38:00,080 --> 00:38:00,913
Okay.

657
00:38:01,450 --> 00:38:03,450
And like,
uh,

658
00:38:03,640 --> 00:38:07,960
then we have a square cause this side,
this side, this side and this side.

659
00:38:08,050 --> 00:38:10,450
It's pretty close.
It's pretty close.

660
00:38:11,290 --> 00:38:15,610
And we need two triangles that are,
oh, if I cut this down the middle,

661
00:38:15,611 --> 00:38:20,470
I get two triangles that are equal.
Right? We're learning geometry to today.

662
00:38:20,710 --> 00:38:24,670
Good thing you're not in school. You
know, it's funny. People say all the time,

663
00:38:24,671 --> 00:38:27,760
you must have been really good at
geometry. And I don't remember.

664
00:38:27,761 --> 00:38:32,020
I don't think I w I think I, no, I
wasn't. I was not a great math student.

665
00:38:32,470 --> 00:38:36,520
Um, I did okay. But Calculus,
Oh man, did that kill me?

666
00:38:37,330 --> 00:38:38,163
Um,

667
00:38:38,740 --> 00:38:42,520
so there we have two triangles and what
we're going to do is fold them in half

668
00:38:42,550 --> 00:38:45,520
and we're going to make two v folds.
There's one,

669
00:38:45,960 --> 00:38:46,793
yeah.

670
00:38:47,650 --> 00:38:52,000
And the fold where theV is, is going
to be down here. Here's the second one.

671
00:38:53,230 --> 00:38:57,430
And we're going to tape these onto our
base. And you know what I'm going to do?

672
00:38:58,060 --> 00:39:03,060
I'm going to make a line on that full
just so we know so you can see it better.

673
00:39:03,791 --> 00:39:05,590
Cause I last time we
couldn't see it as well.

674
00:39:06,650 --> 00:39:07,483
Okay,

675
00:39:13,670 --> 00:39:14,840
sure.
It's really open isn't it?

676
00:39:14,841 --> 00:39:18,410
Yeah cause now I've given you a
lot of cleavage today. All right,

677
00:39:20,660 --> 00:39:25,370
so here are Our v folds and we're going
to have them actually when we glue them

678
00:39:25,371 --> 00:39:29,750
onto this onto the page, we're going to
have them point to the points touching.

679
00:39:30,020 --> 00:39:31,850
So we're going to,

680
00:39:31,880 --> 00:39:36,880
we're going to make sure that that center
line on the top V is lined up with the

681
00:39:38,600 --> 00:39:43,430
main base. Page one.
We're going to do the same

682
00:39:45,410 --> 00:39:49,040
on the bottom. Just like
that kind of looks like an
hourglass a little bit. Right.

683
00:39:51,020 --> 00:39:55,970
And I'm gonna use some white
tape if I have it. Yes.

684
00:39:56,420 --> 00:39:57,380
So I use this tape,

685
00:39:57,381 --> 00:40:01,520
it's very similar to
masking tape in my studio.

686
00:40:01,521 --> 00:40:04,390
It's art artists tape and we're going to,

687
00:40:04,490 --> 00:40:08,690
we're going to tape along
the v because it's a v fold

688
00:40:13,430 --> 00:40:15,850
and there is one.

689
00:40:16,980 --> 00:40:17,600
Okay.

690
00:40:17,600 --> 00:40:22,510
Lined up just like that.
And I always make sure that I put,

691
00:40:22,690 --> 00:40:25,210
I make sure that the tape
is really secure on there.

692
00:40:25,390 --> 00:40:28,240
So now we can see when it moves.
See there is one V,

693
00:40:29,750 --> 00:40:30,583
Huh.

694
00:40:30,610 --> 00:40:32,530
Now we want another view,
but it's going to go the other way.

695
00:40:34,690 --> 00:40:36,720
Actually I'm going to move
it more towards the middle.

696
00:40:39,790 --> 00:40:41,320
That's the other thing.
You can't be afraid.

697
00:40:41,350 --> 00:40:43,240
Don't be afraid when
you're making these popups.

698
00:40:43,300 --> 00:40:47,140
Don't be afraid to pick up the
pieces and move them around.

699
00:40:47,141 --> 00:40:52,120
If you don't like the way they are
can always change,

700
00:40:52,790 --> 00:40:57,460
you know, always make, you
know, remake and fix your
mistakes. I'm just, by the way,

701
00:40:57,461 --> 00:41:01,090
I also, uh, have a, uh, I'm supposed to
remember like all my social media stuff,

702
00:41:01,390 --> 00:41:03,220
so I'm cause I'm not real good at it.

703
00:41:03,400 --> 00:41:07,870
So I have a youtube page where you
can make your own pops. Um, uh,

704
00:41:07,871 --> 00:41:11,830
if you look up Matthew Reinhardt, it's
called a law. Um, let's make it pop.

705
00:41:12,220 --> 00:41:14,950
And I have different crafts.
I'm trying to do them every week.

706
00:41:14,980 --> 00:41:18,400
So if I miss a week, please
don't get mad at me. Um, but, uh,

707
00:41:18,430 --> 00:41:22,090
there's always different things. In
fact, tomorrow is National Superhero Day,

708
00:41:22,450 --> 00:41:25,720
so wear your Cape. Okay. Um, anyways,

709
00:41:25,721 --> 00:41:29,710
tomorrow is national spirit and there's
a pop up super hero card that we made

710
00:41:29,890 --> 00:41:33,870
for a, and I think it went up today so
you can make your own, um, superior.

711
00:41:33,980 --> 00:41:37,700
So there's One v and I'm going to
attach the second V. I know a plant,

712
00:41:37,760 --> 00:41:39,770
I'm making the plant.
Um,

713
00:41:41,600 --> 00:41:43,110
I'm going to just attach this

714
00:41:45,320 --> 00:41:48,980
and then what we're going to do once we
have these two V's working in opposite

715
00:41:48,981 --> 00:41:52,100
directions, then we're going
to make something. It's a,

716
00:41:52,280 --> 00:41:56,510
it's a mechanism or I'm going to
show you they are the two. All right?

717
00:41:56,810 --> 00:41:59,120
And they look, they're going in
different directions. One's going up,

718
00:41:59,150 --> 00:41:59,983
one's going down.

719
00:42:00,830 --> 00:42:05,830
What's cool about this is one side,

720
00:42:06,530 --> 00:42:08,150
like this lower triangle here,

721
00:42:08,960 --> 00:42:13,760
if we attach something to the edge
here on the opposite side, on the top,

722
00:42:14,720 --> 00:42:18,020
on that same edge, so on
opposite sides. So let's see,

723
00:42:18,050 --> 00:42:19,940
I'm looking at myself on there and there.

724
00:42:20,180 --> 00:42:23,840
So if we had make a bridge going across,
if we make a bridge going,

725
00:42:23,841 --> 00:42:26,630
I was trying to watch myself in this thing
and I was like, wait, what's going on?

726
00:42:27,740 --> 00:42:31,610
If we make a bridge going
across what we'll actually,

727
00:42:31,640 --> 00:42:35,150
we'll be able to connect the two and
we'll make a pop up that kind of expands

728
00:42:35,151 --> 00:42:37,040
and twists.
So it's really cool.

729
00:42:37,490 --> 00:42:41,810
So the next thing we're going to do is
we're going to kind of make a little bit

730
00:42:41,811 --> 00:42:46,130
thinner, longer sort of bridge piece.

731
00:42:48,200 --> 00:42:51,380
And I'm going to mark with another color,

732
00:42:52,100 --> 00:42:54,680
the the edges that we're going to connect.

733
00:42:56,990 --> 00:42:57,823
Okay.

734
00:42:58,560 --> 00:43:03,340
You guys see that there to
there and then I'm going to see,

735
00:43:04,360 --> 00:43:06,190
did I make,
I didn't make that long enough.

736
00:43:08,620 --> 00:43:12,340
If you saw my studio, it is a wreck. I
mean there's, there's paper everywhere.

737
00:43:12,341 --> 00:43:16,180
Sometimes I'll come out of my office
after a long day and I'll just have paper

738
00:43:16,181 --> 00:43:18,850
all over. I won't even realize
it. And you know, you know,

739
00:43:18,851 --> 00:43:20,610
people are like y'all get home and,

740
00:43:20,611 --> 00:43:23,830
and you know it's like there's something
on your shirt and it's like the shoes,

741
00:43:23,831 --> 00:43:26,380
you know, piece of piece of
paper or half of a pop up.

742
00:43:26,470 --> 00:43:28,870
Like nobody told me this on the way out.
Okay,

743
00:43:29,050 --> 00:43:31,630
so it's going to go across.

744
00:43:31,870 --> 00:43:35,590
The only thing that is not going to work
is we need to snip off this little bit

745
00:43:35,650 --> 00:43:38,860
and this little bit.
So I'm just gonna use my marker

746
00:43:41,240 --> 00:43:42,073
and

747
00:43:42,620 --> 00:43:44,600
roughly get align.

748
00:43:47,240 --> 00:43:52,240
So there you can see where I'm
supposed to cut it and want to snip,

749
00:43:54,950 --> 00:43:59,450
snip using my tape. And we're going to

750
00:43:59,720 --> 00:44:02,120
attach this.
And what's cool at with this is

751
00:44:03,920 --> 00:44:06,500
we're going to do a part
where it makes sense. Okay.

752
00:44:06,501 --> 00:44:11,501
So now we are going to
attach it from under here.

753
00:44:12,740 --> 00:44:15,530
We'll have a tape go up.
Like I said,

754
00:44:15,531 --> 00:44:20,120
this pop up is called a twister
because it twists. Oh, that's a cool.

755
00:44:21,260 --> 00:44:25,430
The reminder. Matthew, please shut
up soon. All right, here we go.

756
00:44:27,590 --> 00:44:31,650
All right, so now it's attached
from here. All the way across.

757
00:44:31,651 --> 00:44:36,150
There's a bridge and when we close it,
see how it sort of Boeing,

758
00:44:37,770 --> 00:44:41,100
oop, we don't want that.
I mean, come on man. I'm

759
00:44:42,900 --> 00:44:44,280
just gonna make sure it's attached,
right?

760
00:44:44,470 --> 00:44:47,550
And that you have your tape on
there pretty hard. All right,

761
00:44:47,551 --> 00:44:50,190
so we're going to fold it and it's
going to sort of arc like that.

762
00:44:50,430 --> 00:44:52,560
And what's going to happen is
you're going to fold it and it will,

763
00:44:53,290 --> 00:44:55,440
you are going to find,
find the fold.

764
00:44:55,560 --> 00:45:00,560
So you're going to kind of press
down on your pop and smash a little.

765
00:45:02,071 --> 00:45:06,030
So now, now, uh, I'm a very
sensitive artist. Okay.

766
00:45:06,150 --> 00:45:09,210
So when I opened this,
I needed like positive reinforcement.

767
00:45:09,510 --> 00:45:11,940
So I need you to say like,
Ooh,

768
00:45:11,941 --> 00:45:15,870
like be really surprised and excited when
you see it. Okay. Let me make sure. Okay.

769
00:45:16,380 --> 00:45:20,910
All right. Thank God. Thank God.

770
00:45:21,510 --> 00:45:24,960
Wow, that's really
exciting. Wow. All right.

771
00:45:25,800 --> 00:45:30,420
But this is the start of what we
can start building on top of this.

772
00:45:30,630 --> 00:45:35,400
So let's see, what can we do?
You're going to make a plant, right?

773
00:45:35,610 --> 00:45:39,780
So first we need some leaves,

774
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:44,580
right?
And every surface that's here,

775
00:45:44,940 --> 00:45:49,470
it has potential to become
a part of the pop up.

776
00:45:52,050 --> 00:45:54,780
So I'm going to use double stick
tape. Now. Usually I use glue,

777
00:45:54,960 --> 00:45:59,100
but because you know I don't
have a lot of time. There we go.

778
00:45:59,190 --> 00:46:03,780
So there's a leaf and another leaf.

779
00:46:05,520 --> 00:46:09,240
So you guys having fun today,
you learn a lot about,

780
00:46:09,540 --> 00:46:12,720
about what your mom and dad's and
everyone else, all your parents do.

781
00:46:13,410 --> 00:46:17,760
Is it boring? No. Okay, good. I
didn't think it'd be boring here.

782
00:46:17,960 --> 00:46:21,300
Every time I pass by here. So I live in
New York. I live actually in Chelsea.

783
00:46:21,510 --> 00:46:22,740
I'm a few blocks from here.

784
00:46:22,890 --> 00:46:26,340
Every time I pass by Google Belding
I always think to myself, God,

785
00:46:26,341 --> 00:46:28,230
I want a job there.
Um,

786
00:46:28,350 --> 00:46:31,560
because everyone looks like they're so
like having fun and smart and you know,

787
00:46:31,561 --> 00:46:35,790
here I am on my bike and I'm, you know,
covered with paper and sad and pathetic.

788
00:46:36,030 --> 00:46:39,510
So, um, so there's the start of my plant.

789
00:46:39,540 --> 00:46:41,490
Maybe I'll put some leaves here,

790
00:46:44,010 --> 00:46:47,790
but whatever you're doing
here seems exciting.

791
00:46:48,270 --> 00:46:53,190
And so it's cool to be able to get
an idea of what people do. Okay.

792
00:46:53,191 --> 00:46:55,830
I'm starting to get more here.
It's still,

793
00:46:56,140 --> 00:46:59,190
and I'm just adding pieces of paper.
Let's see.

794
00:46:59,770 --> 00:47:01,400
And it doesn't look as
pretty in the beginning.

795
00:47:01,420 --> 00:47:05,280
Sometimes it's just
getting those shapes right.

796
00:47:07,450 --> 00:47:12,000
Let's see. Okay. I don't
want to get a little better.

797
00:47:12,030 --> 00:47:13,930
I mean they wouldn't be hiring me for the,
uh,

798
00:47:14,320 --> 00:47:19,290
the Google doodles anytime soon
on that one. Um, let's see.

799
00:47:19,710 --> 00:47:24,270
We also maybe, you know, most plants
kind of need a little pot to go in,

800
00:47:24,271 --> 00:47:28,200
so we'll cut a little shape down here.

801
00:47:29,410 --> 00:47:34,000
Oh, by the way, should we do that
now while I finish this up? Um,

802
00:47:34,060 --> 00:47:38,850
we are going to give away. How
many books do we have for, um,

803
00:47:38,920 --> 00:47:43,360
we have four books to give away. Um,
now, I'm sorry, we don't have a lot more.

804
00:47:43,540 --> 00:47:46,540
Um, but that's all we had
to give away for today. Um,

805
00:47:46,541 --> 00:47:49,120
you can find my books anywhere.
Like any bookstore,

806
00:47:49,150 --> 00:47:53,230
you can find it online and
Amazon, all those places. Um, uh,

807
00:47:53,231 --> 00:47:55,660
even places like toys r us and
things like that. So, you know,

808
00:47:55,661 --> 00:48:00,190
like there are everywhere. Um, I,
like I said, I have a youtube channel.

809
00:48:00,191 --> 00:48:02,770
You can find me on
Facebook. Uh, there's a, um,

810
00:48:03,270 --> 00:48:05,990
Matthew rock pop up books
by Matthew Reinhardt. Um,

811
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:09,460
so I'm all over the place and
we're going to do a quick,

812
00:48:09,461 --> 00:48:12,280
we're going to have people,
if you have a Lego fact,

813
00:48:12,550 --> 00:48:16,030
I want you to raise your
hand and Lauren will pick.

814
00:48:16,620 --> 00:48:20,980
Now you have to tell us what your
fact is and then you get a book. Um,

815
00:48:21,670 --> 00:48:22,301
so Lauren,

816
00:48:22,301 --> 00:48:25,570
why don't you start going ahead and
I'll finish up my pop up while you start

817
00:48:25,571 --> 00:48:26,404
doing that.
Yeah.

818
00:48:26,930 --> 00:48:27,763
Yep.

819
00:48:29,440 --> 00:48:34,270
And you have to speak up so we
can hear you. That's part of it.

820
00:48:34,271 --> 00:48:38,530
You have to end. You can't
make it up. All Right,

821
00:48:39,470 --> 00:48:40,303
nice.

822
00:48:44,550 --> 00:48:49,080
83. That's right. Get the
man a book. Congratulations.

823
00:48:49,290 --> 00:48:53,010
And I will sign your book at the end,
um, after we're finished. If you'd like.

824
00:48:55,670 --> 00:48:59,910
Oh, the fact was it's been around
how many years? 80, 83 years.

825
00:49:06,770 --> 00:49:08,120
Okay.
Go for it.

826
00:49:16,170 --> 00:49:21,110
Oh yeah, that sounds
right. That sounds good.

827
00:49:23,380 --> 00:49:24,940
Awesome.
Congratulations.

828
00:49:32,600 --> 00:49:35,690
Oh, that's right. And it's
actually in my lego pop.

829
00:49:35,750 --> 00:49:37,850
You get to see that the
evolution of many fingers.

830
00:49:38,060 --> 00:49:41,020
How many living now do you guys have?
Lots of Lego mini figures. Yeah.

831
00:49:41,480 --> 00:49:43,400
It's kind of insane
how many there are now.

832
00:49:49,400 --> 00:49:51,140
Okay.
I'm still working on this,

833
00:49:52,350 --> 00:49:53,183
right?
Yeah.

834
00:49:56,110 --> 00:50:00,670
What's you, what Lego's
headquarters really?

835
00:50:01,990 --> 00:50:05,470
I mean, yes. I mean, yes. I
think you said something about
quarters. I was like, what?

836
00:50:05,650 --> 00:50:10,390
Headquarters? Yes, of course. I was there.
Totally. Yeah. I'm sorry. I'm out of it,

837
00:50:10,391 --> 00:50:15,340
you guys. All right. So
awesome. Congratulations
everybody who wanted the book.

838
00:50:15,341 --> 00:50:20,020
And like I said, I
will. I will definitely.

839
00:50:20,820 --> 00:50:25,780
So wait, I'm not quite done. Um, so she
said you wanted to plant, but you know,

840
00:50:25,781 --> 00:50:29,990
like plants aren't always most
active, you know, things. Of course,

841
00:50:29,991 --> 00:50:33,590
the first thing she said, or
for the first, when she first
said it, I thought, well,

842
00:50:33,591 --> 00:50:38,450
I'll make a plant, but I'm gonna make
'em this plant into a Venus fly trap.

843
00:50:38,540 --> 00:50:42,050
Because, let's see, I've lost some of my,

844
00:50:42,110 --> 00:50:46,580
let's see if I put the neck up here.
Oh yeah,

845
00:50:46,581 --> 00:50:47,780
totally,
totally.

846
00:50:48,260 --> 00:50:53,120
I had a friend who was in one of those
musicals and he wasn't so good. It was a,

847
00:50:53,240 --> 00:50:56,450
it was a community theater and I had
to go see him singing. He was Seymour.

848
00:50:56,870 --> 00:51:01,100
It wasn't so good at it. Um, so let's see
if that works. Does that going to work?

849
00:51:01,180 --> 00:51:04,970
It's going gonna now. Like, like I said,
sometimes we don't get everything right,

850
00:51:04,971 --> 00:51:08,090
so you got to keep trying.
Here we go.

851
00:51:09,220 --> 00:51:13,040
And I lost a leaf in there.
It's hard to do it on the fly.

852
00:51:14,110 --> 00:51:17,990
Let's see if that works. There we go. Now
it sticks out. I cheated a little bit,

853
00:51:18,230 --> 00:51:20,260
but there we go. Oh, we lost the link.

854
00:51:23,700 --> 00:51:24,533
Not Bad.

855
00:51:25,150 --> 00:51:26,760
Could use a little bit more work.
If I had more time,

856
00:51:26,761 --> 00:51:28,200
I'd be able to make something cooler.
But anyways,

857
00:51:28,620 --> 00:51:33,290
thank you so much for having me. You
guys were awesome and, um, you're,

858
00:51:33,300 --> 00:51:37,230
I want to make any pop ups go online
and, uh, have a good day today.

859
00:51:38,640 --> 00:51:39,330
Hi.
All.
