1
00:00:06,260 --> 00:00:10,070
Welcome to toxic Google and
Cambridge, Massachusetts. Uh,

2
00:00:10,230 --> 00:00:13,070
today I'm very pleased to have here,
uh,

3
00:00:13,480 --> 00:00:16,980
on by Gund speaking on
data for the people.

4
00:00:17,120 --> 00:00:21,540
A topic that's a very close to us,
very familiar to us, of course,

5
00:00:21,960 --> 00:00:23,860
and, you know, very
broadly speaking, does it,

6
00:00:23,880 --> 00:00:25,650
there's a couple of ways
to go with this topic.

7
00:00:25,710 --> 00:00:29,940
Obviously we are very generous with
our data and both explicitly and, uh,

8
00:00:30,330 --> 00:00:33,030
and just in the normal course
of living in the modern world.

9
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:36,000
And we get back a lot for that.

10
00:00:36,001 --> 00:00:39,750
And some people might argue that we don't
get back enough or, or, or whatever.

11
00:00:39,810 --> 00:00:44,490
And so one way to go is kind of the,
the negative direction of controlling it,

12
00:00:44,590 --> 00:00:47,220
uh, privacy, micropayments,
all that sort of thing.

13
00:00:47,850 --> 00:00:50,360
The other direction is to be
much more open and positive, um,

14
00:00:50,530 --> 00:00:55,530
to embrace this and then see we can
maximize the benefit we get from data.

15
00:00:55,900 --> 00:01:00,680
I think a ladder is broadly,
uh, on today's his approach.
But of course, you know,

16
00:01:00,760 --> 00:01:02,320
there are dangers, uh, uh,

17
00:01:02,670 --> 00:01:06,450
there are things we can do to make
this work as well as possible for our,

18
00:01:06,451 --> 00:01:09,290
for us as individuals. And, uh, um,

19
00:01:09,820 --> 00:01:11,470
that'll be the topic for today and stuff.

20
00:01:11,480 --> 00:01:14,550
Something that had done the is there's
a lot of experience with, um, but,

21
00:01:14,551 --> 00:01:17,610
but rather than doing
a conventional, um, uh,

22
00:01:18,270 --> 00:01:21,990
introduction I think will make this a
little bit more interactive and dynamic.

23
00:01:21,991 --> 00:01:26,010
Like let's talk in general. So a, so
please contact us, welcome to Google

24
00:01:30,330 --> 00:01:34,980
and welcome to the social data
revolution because ultimately,

25
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:37,950
not only is this the title
of my Youtube Channel,

26
00:01:38,220 --> 00:01:41,460
but ultimately really that is
the amazing world we live in.

27
00:01:42,440 --> 00:01:46,510
So reading the book, you started
life actually as a, as a physicist.

28
00:01:46,660 --> 00:01:50,140
And so how did you come
to be what you are today?

29
00:01:50,890 --> 00:01:55,890
So I got my phd in physics at Stanford
and I've always been a data person.

30
00:01:56,590 --> 00:01:59,180
I was at soon as an undergraduate.

31
00:01:59,181 --> 00:02:04,181
It was really amazing to be logged in to
other computers and that was way before

32
00:02:04,481 --> 00:02:08,280
the web was invented. And, uh,

33
00:02:08,290 --> 00:02:12,430
then I went to my phd advisor,
my initial Phd Advisor at slack,

34
00:02:12,431 --> 00:02:16,060
the Stanford Linear Accelerator Center,
and told him, Jonathan, you know,

35
00:02:16,090 --> 00:02:21,090
I really thought about it and I'm more
interested in newer networks that in

36
00:02:21,281 --> 00:02:26,200
particle physics. So he
said, okay, what is that?

37
00:02:26,260 --> 00:02:29,980
And he thought, you know, poking Alec
Tours in new monkeys or something. No, no,

38
00:02:30,010 --> 00:02:34,040
it's about learning from data and that,
you know, he could live with. And uh,

39
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:37,690
he was super generous to then next
year you still support me for a while.

40
00:02:37,691 --> 00:02:42,130
And then my phd with Dave rumor
heart who are some people you know,

41
00:02:42,131 --> 00:02:46,910
really think was the one who pushed
the idea of neural networks. And uh,

42
00:02:46,950 --> 00:02:49,690
that's what my phd and so machine
learning as would call it now,

43
00:02:50,170 --> 00:02:52,780
lots of people in the world
and know about it now.

44
00:02:52,810 --> 00:02:54,430
Those days were just a few of us.

45
00:02:54,530 --> 00:02:59,020
[inaudible] Facebook's neuronetworks
stuff now was one of my friends.

46
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:03,250
So, um, it was a very smooth transition.

47
00:03:03,640 --> 00:03:06,580
The transition from,
you know, doing physics,

48
00:03:06,581 --> 00:03:09,730
which I still love and I will say
once if it's just always visits.

49
00:03:09,731 --> 00:03:13,300
If you think like a physicist, then you
have actually a couple of attributes.

50
00:03:13,301 --> 00:03:17,560
One is you don't run away from
data but you run towards data.

51
00:03:18,210 --> 00:03:21,430
So sometimes when I talk to people from
the tend to intelligence community,

52
00:03:21,520 --> 00:03:25,590
they would tell me that
I would be terrible agent
because when I see something

53
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:28,780
sketchy I always, you know, want
to see what's happening there.

54
00:03:29,050 --> 00:03:30,520
Like sketchy data for instance,

55
00:03:30,521 --> 00:03:32,860
where you need to interpret the
data and fill in some meaning.

56
00:03:33,610 --> 00:03:38,410
Second thing physicists do is that
they're pretty good in what I call data

57
00:03:38,411 --> 00:03:42,880
literacy. So for me, data
literacy is that, you know,

58
00:03:42,881 --> 00:03:45,040
order of magnitude calculations,
you know,

59
00:03:45,041 --> 00:03:49,200
what can be the case in what can't be
the case as opposed to my brothers.

60
00:03:49,210 --> 00:03:51,970
I was a physicist and he says when
there's computer science Grad students,

61
00:03:51,971 --> 00:03:54,040
they always come and say,
oh,

62
00:03:54,160 --> 00:03:57,320
the algorithm is already converging
with the least significant digit.

63
00:03:59,650 --> 00:04:03,340
So physicists, they know
about numbers, they love data.

64
00:04:03,341 --> 00:04:08,170
And the most important thing is I
think they love experiments. So,

65
00:04:08,710 --> 00:04:12,370
uh, at some stage 2001, 2002,

66
00:04:12,830 --> 00:04:17,230
a phone rang and the headhunter was on
the line and he said that Jeff Bezos

67
00:04:17,410 --> 00:04:19,660
would like to have a chief scientist.

68
00:04:20,470 --> 00:04:24,940
And I try to figure out why I'd never
worked in a real company and why would I

69
00:04:24,941 --> 00:04:27,310
want to work leave university.
We're going to company.

70
00:04:27,311 --> 00:04:29,680
And so it turns out the Jeff,
of course,

71
00:04:29,760 --> 00:04:33,730
a new from previously being a
de show how important data is,

72
00:04:33,850 --> 00:04:35,860
but what he can do in retail of course,

73
00:04:35,861 --> 00:04:39,010
as opposed to in finance where it
can be expensive as experiments.

74
00:04:39,550 --> 00:04:43,660
So just like Google,
we,

75
00:04:44,020 --> 00:04:47,860
when I was at Amazon and of course
afterwards have done tens of thousands of

76
00:04:47,861 --> 00:04:52,861
experiments and you probably all know
many stories and maybe I leave some for

77
00:04:53,981 --> 00:04:56,760
the Q and a if we still have time.
Um,

78
00:04:57,100 --> 00:04:59,470
I was also wanted to be a
bit more interactive in that.

79
00:04:59,920 --> 00:05:02,410
So then after Amazon I
went back to teaching.

80
00:05:02,411 --> 00:05:07,411
I love teaching and I have to say I
teach one course a year at UC Berkeley

81
00:05:07,511 --> 00:05:10,880
called social data revolution. And, uh,

82
00:05:10,881 --> 00:05:15,640
it is just amazing to have the opportunity
to basically have the university is a

83
00:05:15,641 --> 00:05:19,600
platform where once a
week for 10 weeks or so,

84
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:24,640
very smart students sit there and they
actually listen to you and the debug your

85
00:05:24,641 --> 00:05:27,460
thoughts and then you see when
it's really painful for them.

86
00:05:27,461 --> 00:05:30,850
If you don't know how to do something
on Facebook, like then, you know,

87
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:32,890
they just help you out and
they explain it to you.

88
00:05:33,160 --> 00:05:37,930
So I think it's a great deal as a
wonderful way to spend your life.

89
00:05:38,890 --> 00:05:41,980
And then however it doesn't scale.

90
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,340
So scaling is important.

91
00:05:45,341 --> 00:05:49,510
And that's when I got the idea to actually
write the book about three years ago,

92
00:05:49,511 --> 00:05:50,800
a little bit more than three years ago.

93
00:05:51,190 --> 00:05:55,780
And the book I then want you to write has
been compressed into the chapter seven,

94
00:05:55,990 --> 00:05:57,890
which is my favorite chapter in this book,

95
00:05:58,100 --> 00:06:02,570
which has all of the examples and the
different verticals which are look at

96
00:06:03,650 --> 00:06:06,380
unfortunately, you know, when I
talked to my editor said, you know,

97
00:06:06,381 --> 00:06:09,980
you need to prepare them for this. You
can't expect every reader to, you know,

98
00:06:09,981 --> 00:06:11,990
be at Google or Amazon or Facebook.

99
00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:15,480
So if we had these sort of six
chapters leading up to it, um,

100
00:06:15,990 --> 00:06:18,770
and one of them is data to
a ca as I just mentioned it.

101
00:06:18,790 --> 00:06:22,730
So actually this book data for the
people is really meant for the people.

102
00:06:24,250 --> 00:06:27,470
And I don't only teach at Berkeley,
I also teach in China.

103
00:06:28,640 --> 00:06:30,860
And um,

104
00:06:31,610 --> 00:06:36,610
I'm not sure how dubious honor it was
that people's daily had a long interview

105
00:06:38,540 --> 00:06:41,690
with me, published on the front
page about data for the people.

106
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:44,330
I don't switch Annie's,
I don't know what it really says.

107
00:06:44,331 --> 00:06:47,090
I can only feel the
worst, but uh, you know,

108
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:50,060
people's Daily and data for the people
sounds on the surface structure at least

109
00:06:50,061 --> 00:06:54,410
kind of similar.
So why did a write the book?

110
00:06:55,130 --> 00:07:00,130
I wrote the book because I realized when
I was at Amazon and each and every one

111
00:07:03,471 --> 00:07:05,540
of you,
I'm sure it has the same utilization.

112
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:10,370
He had Google that the refineries,
as I call them,

113
00:07:10,371 --> 00:07:14,690
the data refineries like Google,
that they,

114
00:07:15,380 --> 00:07:20,030
without even trying hard,
no so much about us,

115
00:07:20,060 --> 00:07:25,060
about us as individuals that I
think it is a wrong battle to fight.

116
00:07:26,450 --> 00:07:31,450
The wrong battle is to try to plug
the holes and maybe being a good year.

117
00:07:31,640 --> 00:07:36,170
A good story for this is Google maps
from the early days where I was told from

118
00:07:36,171 --> 00:07:41,171
Salford involved in that meeting
that somebody hacked Google maps and

119
00:07:41,361 --> 00:07:45,590
immediately idea came well
rather than plugging that hole,

120
00:07:45,860 --> 00:07:47,960
how couldn't we make back to feature?

121
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:52,190
How can we make it possible for
people to actually amend data?

122
00:07:52,850 --> 00:07:57,850
So that thinking that you don't try to
really stop the in stoppable but you see

123
00:08:03,290 --> 00:08:04,970
what can we create of it?

124
00:08:05,810 --> 00:08:10,810
That is the underlying thought which I
very much embraced and I hope that the

125
00:08:11,421 --> 00:08:14,840
readers of the book will
also get a feeling about why.

126
00:08:15,140 --> 00:08:20,140
I think embracing the data and being
empowered by the data is what I think are

127
00:08:21,651 --> 00:08:26,651
better choices rather than
the romanticizing the view
of how good it was when we

128
00:08:27,171 --> 00:08:30,980
could have control of our data.
And you know,

129
00:08:30,981 --> 00:08:34,520
taking back these all these metaphors,
taking back control,

130
00:08:34,521 --> 00:08:39,200
I mean we never had control of our data.
So hey, we can't possibly have control.

131
00:08:40,160 --> 00:08:44,310
Imagine a week without Google.

132
00:08:45,260 --> 00:08:49,160
You know, you could stay home, you
wouldn't have to come into work, but boy,

133
00:08:49,220 --> 00:08:54,140
how would you get stuff done? I
mean, what would staff be? So for me,

134
00:08:54,141 --> 00:08:55,560
when I see Sue's later revolution,

135
00:08:55,740 --> 00:09:00,740
that really is a revolution which
is affected billions people's lives.

136
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:05,670
No question. We of course think about
information differently. Google,

137
00:09:06,420 --> 00:09:11,100
we think about stuff, we
buy it differently. Amazon,

138
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:16,920
I mean who of you would not look at a
review before they choose a certain item?

139
00:09:17,971 --> 00:09:19,890
By the way,
if anybody wants to review the book,

140
00:09:20,190 --> 00:09:24,240
Amazon is open off or reviews and I
think it's a very important ingredient.

141
00:09:25,050 --> 00:09:27,690
Thirdly,
in everything about who you are,

142
00:09:28,740 --> 00:09:33,740
there's potentially take Google plus or
maybe Facebook or if you're in China,

143
00:09:33,781 --> 00:09:38,760
we chat that has changed the way a
billion people think about who they are.

144
00:09:39,060 --> 00:09:39,893
I would argue.

145
00:09:40,770 --> 00:09:45,770
So the general framework is how can we
work together the refineries and the

146
00:09:49,411 --> 00:09:54,411
individuals to figure out what
can we create for the individuals.

147
00:09:54,841 --> 00:09:59,841
So Google of course has the longterm
you that if you have the choice,

148
00:10:00,301 --> 00:10:04,680
but making a quick buck now or
having a consumer in the long term,

149
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:06,180
you of course go for the long term.

150
00:10:06,810 --> 00:10:09,330
So in some way I'm
preaching to the choir here,

151
00:10:10,590 --> 00:10:13,140
but I still want to go back
to the question and the thing,

152
00:10:13,141 --> 00:10:14,790
it's a question worth asking people.

153
00:10:15,090 --> 00:10:19,980
What would you do if you didn't
have access to Google for a day?

154
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:24,570
And then people realize
just how much would break

155
00:10:26,520 --> 00:10:28,770
and it wouldn't even find him staying
with a friend of mine who works for me,

156
00:10:28,771 --> 00:10:31,980
diamonds, I wouldn't even find
the place without Google maps.

157
00:10:32,970 --> 00:10:37,970
And then I was trying to really get out
to people that necessity that it is,

158
00:10:40,020 --> 00:10:43,620
I need to tell Google where I want to go.

159
00:10:44,220 --> 00:10:48,300
Otherwise Google cannot tell me turn left
at the the next, the next intersection.

160
00:10:48,750 --> 00:10:51,210
So I really part of data literacy,

161
00:10:51,211 --> 00:10:56,211
hope that we can upgrade the conversation
from people that those logical things

162
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:03,800
that you know in the restaurant and
oh I pay after I eat or whatever.

163
00:11:04,020 --> 00:11:09,020
Better examples you might have that
those also applied to data and if you go

164
00:11:09,121 --> 00:11:13,670
into a cab and not sure where the Nfu
straight it and the Cabbie asks you where

165
00:11:13,770 --> 00:11:14,730
are,
can I take you and said,

166
00:11:14,760 --> 00:11:18,960
oh I'm not telling you that would be
probably invading my privacy and is not

167
00:11:18,961 --> 00:11:19,890
going very far.

168
00:11:20,830 --> 00:11:25,830
And now what I think by first of the six
rights I wanted to talk about is it is

169
00:11:26,791 --> 00:11:28,710
a right to access your data.

170
00:11:31,020 --> 00:11:36,000
Now I see all of you nodding and
a former president Obama also set,

171
00:11:36,001 --> 00:11:38,940
this is the right to access
your data as an important right.

172
00:11:39,570 --> 00:11:44,570
It is not as trivial as it sounds because
it clearly isn't just access to the

173
00:11:47,011 --> 00:11:51,810
bits and the bytes.
So I was in Shanghai,

174
00:11:52,680 --> 00:11:53,650
actually these people,

175
00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:58,510
People's Daily was at my place
interviewing me and I showed them location

176
00:11:58,511 --> 00:12:01,540
history on Google. So
I shoot them, you know,

177
00:12:01,541 --> 00:12:06,190
you go into history and location and it
has to pick a date. And they said, Oh wow,

178
00:12:06,191 --> 00:12:11,140
that is so amazing. Wow.
That was something beyond,

179
00:12:11,290 --> 00:12:16,290
they could believe that a company giving
back or is returning to the user in

180
00:12:18,371 --> 00:12:21,170
exchange to, you know,
showing me more relevant nets.

181
00:12:22,120 --> 00:12:27,120
And I by the [inaudible] I used to
show Google latitude on my webpage on

182
00:12:28,391 --> 00:12:30,340
viagen.com and yes,

183
00:12:30,341 --> 00:12:33,790
indeed there were a situation that
Remming one dinner where ours, you know,

184
00:12:33,791 --> 00:12:34,481
traffic is something,

185
00:12:34,481 --> 00:12:37,980
I was chairman of the bay area pretty
late and a tool to the other parties and

186
00:12:37,990 --> 00:12:40,900
you know, I'd be there five
minutes is that you won't,

187
00:12:40,990 --> 00:12:45,310
I know you are still
in one oh one. So, uh,

188
00:12:45,340 --> 00:12:48,880
that right to access to
data is very important.

189
00:12:48,881 --> 00:12:53,881
One building tools that allow people to
get meaning out of the acts of the data

190
00:12:55,360 --> 00:13:00,160
is where I think the most important
part comes from just raw here is all the

191
00:13:00,161 --> 00:13:01,960
data out of Facebook,
doesn't help anything.

192
00:13:02,170 --> 00:13:06,500
Building an awesome tour likes
Google location history. Um,

193
00:13:06,580 --> 00:13:08,770
search history.
I think it's about,

194
00:13:09,310 --> 00:13:12,580
for me at least the last thing you know,

195
00:13:12,640 --> 00:13:17,640
I would be willing to share my search
history and honestly I don't think anybody

196
00:13:18,431 --> 00:13:20,860
who thinks about it
would think differently.

197
00:13:21,070 --> 00:13:25,270
You can have all my text messages and
have all my email but my searches.

198
00:13:28,180 --> 00:13:32,050
But you have them already. So I mean, um,

199
00:13:33,220 --> 00:13:37,510
eh building tools that help
people understand that data.

200
00:13:37,870 --> 00:13:39,820
Since this is an educated crowd here,

201
00:13:40,150 --> 00:13:45,150
one of my favorite sayings is
to make the implicit explicit.

202
00:13:45,910 --> 00:13:46,960
The two meanings to it.

203
00:13:47,290 --> 00:13:52,290
One is in all the data which I
look at all the searches I do,

204
00:13:52,770 --> 00:13:55,570
making implicit patterns,
showing them to me,

205
00:13:55,810 --> 00:13:59,860
I think that at least is fun and might
actually help me also make some decisions

206
00:13:59,980 --> 00:14:03,490
like the hours of the day when I
searched or the days of the week,

207
00:14:03,820 --> 00:14:07,870
things like that. The topics. Topics
are always very hard to classify it,

208
00:14:08,200 --> 00:14:12,530
but making implicit patterns explicit is
part of giving somebody access to their

209
00:14:12,531 --> 00:14:13,364
data.

210
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:19,800
The second part or the secondary mutation
of make the implicit explicit is that

211
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:25,560
as a company you write down
a function for this search,

212
00:14:25,601 --> 00:14:25,840
right?

213
00:14:25,840 --> 00:14:30,840
Events where you figure out what are the
ways to evaluate whether if we do this

214
00:14:33,281 --> 00:14:35,860
kind of eyewear them or that
kind of, I would, you know,

215
00:14:35,861 --> 00:14:37,960
this primary a treat
versus that primary trick,

216
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:42,580
which one actually do we believe
is better in the long term.

217
00:14:42,580 --> 00:14:45,340
So into this with a called
equation of business,

218
00:14:45,790 --> 00:14:50,200
you bake in an incredible
amount of assumptions,

219
00:14:50,201 --> 00:14:53,750
but you make explicit,
and Amazon,

220
00:14:53,870 --> 00:14:58,870
I spent probably 50 hours who stiff visas
for each group to figure out what is

221
00:15:00,680 --> 00:15:05,360
the which quoted fitness function that
they should be evaluated by and has have

222
00:15:05,361 --> 00:15:09,530
a buy in. And they're all, those are
mistakes. You always forget something.

223
00:15:09,531 --> 00:15:12,980
And then of course smart people go and
optimize for that. And he said, Oh yes,

224
00:15:12,981 --> 00:15:17,090
right? But that of course we
didn't mean. So, for example,
if someone says, you know,

225
00:15:17,091 --> 00:15:18,530
we want to increase conversion rates,

226
00:15:18,890 --> 00:15:22,880
so you turn after the first sale of
the year, you turn your service off.

227
00:15:23,060 --> 00:15:27,900
No more sales, but a hundred percent
conversion rate. So you know, it's,

228
00:15:27,910 --> 00:15:30,710
it's a constant process
and make it explicit.

229
00:15:30,711 --> 00:15:35,210
It's something which I think is super
useful for the company and it really

230
00:15:35,211 --> 00:15:40,211
condenses the thinking and reasonable
people absolutely can disagree on things.

231
00:15:41,930 --> 00:15:44,990
But then once you have it, you
know, and the new crank, the handle,

232
00:15:45,140 --> 00:15:47,120
whether this experiment or
that experiment is better.

233
00:15:50,600 --> 00:15:53,630
So the first ride is
right to access your data.

234
00:15:53,780 --> 00:15:57,380
Let me throw another wrench into it.
Your data.

235
00:15:58,490 --> 00:16:01,970
So let's say a Facebook. So today, uh,

236
00:16:01,971 --> 00:16:06,500
I am on NPR marketplace tech
and there are lots of comments.

237
00:16:06,710 --> 00:16:10,620
Now if I change the post,
I have my Facebook a Vegas.

238
00:16:10,910 --> 00:16:15,350
If I change the post summit, if I change
it a lot, then suddenly, you know,

239
00:16:15,351 --> 00:16:18,560
some of the comments people make
don't make sense anymore. You know,

240
00:16:18,561 --> 00:16:21,620
I might be learning from some of the
comments I might incorporate into my

241
00:16:21,621 --> 00:16:26,180
Facebook post. Now they look really
stupid. So whose data is this?

242
00:16:26,540 --> 00:16:30,320
So our ownership concept that you know,

243
00:16:30,350 --> 00:16:34,160
works for apples or even for,
for physical books here,

244
00:16:35,150 --> 00:16:38,600
that ownership concept
clearly breaks down for data.

245
00:16:39,290 --> 00:16:43,610
So I don't have a solution which I a,
you must do it this way,

246
00:16:43,880 --> 00:16:48,260
but I do see a couple of directions how
people should think about it differently.

247
00:16:48,980 --> 00:16:52,040
And it clearly,
you might've heard the example last year,

248
00:16:52,460 --> 00:16:56,960
which I think is a beautiful one off fed
monkey that took a picture of himself,

249
00:16:56,961 --> 00:17:01,580
that Selfie and you know,
then the photographer sued uh,

250
00:17:01,610 --> 00:17:05,210
Wikimedia or whoever published the
picture because they said, you know,

251
00:17:05,211 --> 00:17:06,590
it was not taken by human.

252
00:17:07,040 --> 00:17:11,750
So these are just very interesting
topics which I love for us as society to

253
00:17:11,751 --> 00:17:15,200
discuss. And the ownership
of data from me and images.

254
00:17:15,201 --> 00:17:19,220
Data is one of the examples where
I really feel, let's actually no,

255
00:17:19,221 --> 00:17:23,390
not run away from it and please
let's not run away and say, oh,

256
00:17:23,391 --> 00:17:26,720
the lawyer's a hundred years ago
they wrote down how to treat it.

257
00:17:26,721 --> 00:17:31,070
They had no fricking idea of what we
have now is a good starting point.

258
00:17:31,160 --> 00:17:33,830
But let's work together and
actually make it better.

259
00:17:35,850 --> 00:17:38,450
Um, access to my data.
I have one more story.

260
00:17:40,070 --> 00:17:42,170
It's not in the book.
Um,

261
00:17:42,230 --> 00:17:47,230
there is a German paper which is called
[inaudible] and it's the largest paper

262
00:17:49,020 --> 00:17:54,020
in the western hemisphere would do is
have dd publication and not particularly

263
00:17:54,170 --> 00:17:58,770
the lecture shall we say. And
the head, the editor and chief,

264
00:17:59,310 --> 00:18:03,720
um,
came to class in Brooklyn and uh,

265
00:18:04,020 --> 00:18:07,380
we had dinner and someone took a
picture and post it in Facebook.

266
00:18:08,310 --> 00:18:13,310
I was barely starting on the bay bridge
when my phone rang and the tats and more

267
00:18:15,271 --> 00:18:19,500
left wing paper called me up and said,
we saw a picture.

268
00:18:19,560 --> 00:18:21,690
We need to do interviews.
It absolutely.

269
00:18:22,350 --> 00:18:26,340
And what happened was then they said,
we just have one question.

270
00:18:28,230 --> 00:18:31,200
Who has the most power
over you as a consumer?

271
00:18:33,390 --> 00:18:37,080
Apple.
Amazon,

272
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:43,830
Facebook, Google. What do you think?

273
00:18:45,540 --> 00:18:50,490
Anybody would not say? Google. Raise
your hand. Oh yeah. Who Do you think

274
00:18:52,410 --> 00:18:57,260
your friends, we talked
about companies. Okay. Uh,

275
00:18:57,300 --> 00:19:02,070
I don't know whether Google has more
power over me than my friends because you

276
00:19:02,071 --> 00:19:02,904
know,

277
00:19:03,210 --> 00:19:07,680
let's say Google wants to let me
disappear or remove me from the index.

278
00:19:09,240 --> 00:19:13,620
Yeah, we knew this guy, Andrea says, not
even any trace left of him. Not a problem.

279
00:19:14,820 --> 00:19:18,930
And I actually, you all are familiar
with the right to be forgotten.

280
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:20,100
The de linking,

281
00:19:21,270 --> 00:19:25,230
which by the way in terms of raw numbers
is nothing compared to copyright things.

282
00:19:25,231 --> 00:19:27,450
Google has to deal with by,
you know,

283
00:19:27,620 --> 00:19:30,270
companies complaining that
something was used illegally.

284
00:19:31,560 --> 00:19:35,880
I want not a right to be forgotten.
I want to write to be remembered.

285
00:19:36,860 --> 00:19:37,441
So for me,

286
00:19:37,441 --> 00:19:41,710
the right to access for data means also
the right to remember some suicidal

287
00:19:41,770 --> 00:19:45,690
agreement that hey and who is doing a
very good job in that, that you know,

288
00:19:46,140 --> 00:19:49,140
I want my old emails to not
sort of random disappear.

289
00:19:52,770 --> 00:19:54,900
Big Difference to China.

290
00:19:56,160 --> 00:20:01,160
So I gave a talk at a company in December
and I wonder to pull up on we chat,

291
00:20:03,780 --> 00:20:07,830
which is sort of Tencent's version of
Facebook. It's a communication tool.

292
00:20:08,100 --> 00:20:10,110
I want to put up on Richard a picture.

293
00:20:10,111 --> 00:20:14,160
Somebody else had posted with me
and Jack Ma maybe two weeks prior,

294
00:20:15,780 --> 00:20:19,980
not thinking anything of at this,
this picture is no longer available.

295
00:20:20,130 --> 00:20:23,860
It might've been removed by the
whatever the portion is posted.

296
00:20:23,880 --> 00:20:24,830
Of course all in Chinese,

297
00:20:24,870 --> 00:20:26,460
you don't know what it means
to us with what does it mean.

298
00:20:27,150 --> 00:20:32,150
And I felt really violated that
there something which I do to,

299
00:20:33,590 --> 00:20:33,990
you know,

300
00:20:33,990 --> 00:20:38,400
get them good traffic and then two weeks
later I give this nebulous message by

301
00:20:38,401 --> 00:20:40,140
this picture is no longer available.

302
00:20:41,160 --> 00:20:43,320
Now of course it's a question
a hundred years probably.

303
00:20:43,321 --> 00:20:47,590
I have no problem with that.
Two weeks I do have a with that.

304
00:20:48,160 --> 00:20:51,520
So I really brought that up in
that crowd and was quite annoyed.

305
00:20:51,521 --> 00:20:52,870
I mean sort of happens in real time.

306
00:20:52,871 --> 00:20:57,490
I want to show them somebody is no
longer there really pushing what company

307
00:20:57,491 --> 00:20:59,140
would you want to have taken care of?

308
00:20:59,141 --> 00:21:03,610
Your data it company that
really has very good service,

309
00:21:03,611 --> 00:21:06,940
that agreement and says the uptime
versus a company which, you know,

310
00:21:06,941 --> 00:21:10,410
random delete stuff. And then they say,
oh, it's too expensive to, you know,

311
00:21:10,420 --> 00:21:11,051
half a serve.

312
00:21:11,051 --> 00:21:14,920
I mean that's as ridiculous as cost of
storage is not what difference it would

313
00:21:14,921 --> 00:21:17,550
make for anybody. How much,
how much can you produce it?

314
00:21:17,590 --> 00:21:21,340
A hundred bucks a yet very most.
And the Chinese said,

315
00:21:21,580 --> 00:21:26,580
oh we would prefer that second company
and that is what really brought these

316
00:21:26,860 --> 00:21:31,090
cultural bias is very much up
to the forefront of my thinking.

317
00:21:31,450 --> 00:21:32,840
I'm familiar with Europe's,

318
00:21:32,920 --> 00:21:36,130
I gave you the example right here
before gotten versus what we think here,

319
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:41,640
but the adage do was your data and that
they they embrace in a femoral nature.

320
00:21:42,030 --> 00:21:44,770
Whereas I,
I grew up in a world where you know,

321
00:21:45,100 --> 00:21:48,670
I could fix these things are there and
you can attach them who can access them.

322
00:21:49,150 --> 00:21:54,150
So sometimes our biases might just be
representing us well and other people in

323
00:21:54,221 --> 00:21:56,260
the word think about it differently.

324
00:21:56,710 --> 00:22:01,300
And two nights ago I had dinner
with Dan economen and I asked him,

325
00:22:01,990 --> 00:22:03,700
why do you think that's the case?

326
00:22:04,330 --> 00:22:09,330
And he thought maybe it
is that the attitude was
accountability is different in

327
00:22:10,871 --> 00:22:12,970
the US compared to China.

328
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:17,230
That they are very happy not to blame it
on the computer, which is not an excuse.

329
00:22:17,290 --> 00:22:20,800
Probably any of us would accept if
somebody says, you know a Checkin,

330
00:22:20,980 --> 00:22:23,680
I'm sorry the computer made a mistake.
No it's not the computer,

331
00:22:23,681 --> 00:22:26,110
which made me see somebody made a mistake,
not the computer.

332
00:22:27,940 --> 00:22:29,830
The other point I want to make,

333
00:22:29,831 --> 00:22:34,450
and that's the last one on this
right here to access your data is uh,

334
00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:36,100
in comparison with your tie in the US,

335
00:22:36,310 --> 00:22:40,540
this huge experiment of running Facebook
for an a billion people and running.

336
00:22:40,540 --> 00:22:44,070
We chat for B and people and uh,

337
00:22:44,200 --> 00:22:46,390
I don't know who of you has been on Wechat

338
00:22:49,430 --> 00:22:51,850
or too few people in that case.

339
00:22:52,090 --> 00:22:55,690
Let me just say very generally
that the assumption for instance,

340
00:22:55,691 --> 00:23:00,580
that if you are friends you usually
can see the friends we have in common,

341
00:23:00,790 --> 00:23:05,560
which seems that get perfectly good
thing for me. That after all, you know,

342
00:23:05,860 --> 00:23:09,040
if we have friends in common,
if if mutual friends,

343
00:23:09,220 --> 00:23:11,770
then why would I hide my
mutual friends from you?

344
00:23:11,771 --> 00:23:16,771
I think this data symmetry as Jordan Novat
wrote it in a wonderful article a few

345
00:23:17,950 --> 00:23:22,480
years ago. This data symmetry is
the way I think fantasist built.

346
00:23:23,500 --> 00:23:28,420
No way we should would ever
show you any buddies, friends.

347
00:23:29,380 --> 00:23:32,940
So it's a bit like my PR agent that they
don't give me his number because you

348
00:23:32,941 --> 00:23:35,410
know I might disintermediate them,
not think that you know,

349
00:23:35,680 --> 00:23:39,580
when we meet I could actually ask you for
a number so they might as well make it

350
00:23:39,910 --> 00:23:42,370
frictionless and make
it easier and you know,

351
00:23:42,550 --> 00:23:45,300
see for some potential there be,

352
00:23:45,301 --> 00:23:48,980
this connects off saying hey be
introduced and you take it from here.

353
00:23:48,980 --> 00:23:52,700
So that wrong notion about having
power booth withholding data,

354
00:23:53,270 --> 00:23:55,520
it's the notion of how
the word used to work.

355
00:23:55,850 --> 00:24:00,850
Companies got big by erecting barriers
to inflammation and that's how money used

356
00:24:01,911 --> 00:24:06,470
to be made. Like used car
dealers as an example. Now,

357
00:24:06,890 --> 00:24:08,990
if you're thinking about the
companies who know and love,

358
00:24:09,350 --> 00:24:14,350
they got big by removing barriers to
information and I just love as far as,

359
00:24:14,870 --> 00:24:18,530
I love when the sign
flips and another sign,

360
00:24:18,531 --> 00:24:21,950
flip example in this world is when
I was an Undergrad in Germany,

361
00:24:23,060 --> 00:24:26,630
we were not allowed to unplug our phones.

362
00:24:27,920 --> 00:24:32,920
So the role of the government was to
protect the network from the consumer.

363
00:24:35,330 --> 00:24:38,480
And luckily at least under
the previous administration,

364
00:24:39,020 --> 00:24:42,860
there have been moves to actually produce
a proactive consumer from the network.

365
00:24:43,250 --> 00:24:46,610
So signed flips is something
I'd love to talk about more.

366
00:24:46,850 --> 00:24:48,350
I have a few examples in the book.

367
00:24:48,500 --> 00:24:52,500
I think just very interesting
when something doesn't
change by 10% but changes

368
00:24:52,520 --> 00:24:55,160
aside from plus to minus or minus or plus

369
00:24:57,320 --> 00:24:58,340
five more rights to go.

370
00:24:58,970 --> 00:25:03,970
The second right is the right
to inspect the refineries.

371
00:25:04,910 --> 00:25:09,500
So when you buy a car
or fridge or whatever,

372
00:25:09,980 --> 00:25:14,780
typically there are some things like
stickers on it that help you make a

373
00:25:14,781 --> 00:25:16,550
decision.
For instance,

374
00:25:16,551 --> 00:25:21,340
the fuel efficiency or
how loud the fridges, no,

375
00:25:22,340 --> 00:25:27,340
these are numbers which EPA or other
groups agree on how to measure it.

376
00:25:27,740 --> 00:25:30,840
So it's not just one person just,
you know, puts Niya and says, oh,

377
00:25:30,841 --> 00:25:31,880
you know that fridges out.

378
00:25:32,420 --> 00:25:35,030
That would be the current administration's
that's true to this. But no,

379
00:25:35,031 --> 00:25:39,860
they had scientists and they actual fig
out without being gagged how they can

380
00:25:39,861 --> 00:25:43,460
actually come up with this number.
So you as a consumer can compare them.

381
00:25:45,620 --> 00:25:50,420
I would the same for refineries
for data refineries have not,

382
00:25:50,570 --> 00:25:51,890
of course not fuel efficiency,

383
00:25:51,891 --> 00:25:55,820
but you know how secure is my data.

384
00:25:57,440 --> 00:26:01,910
So it has no question when you know,
people not easily come and say, oh,

385
00:26:01,940 --> 00:26:05,720
I would not put the data up in
the cloud if she goes in Shanghai.

386
00:26:05,721 --> 00:26:10,670
When I heard that argument, what do
you like using docs here from China?

387
00:26:10,700 --> 00:26:14,630
What if Google can see what you're
writing? Say, you know, they see anyways,

388
00:26:14,840 --> 00:26:17,840
besides there's the Chinese government,
so don't fool yourself.

389
00:26:17,930 --> 00:26:20,360
Don't live the illusion
that they don't know.

390
00:26:20,570 --> 00:26:25,570
But we have extremely strong economic
constructs that companies do not want to

391
00:26:25,821 --> 00:26:29,230
be broken into. Because as you saw
in Sony's example, for instance,

392
00:26:29,231 --> 00:26:30,530
it can be very expensive.

393
00:26:30,800 --> 00:26:34,400
And if there ever was a security issue,

394
00:26:34,910 --> 00:26:39,740
which affected consumers at that say one
of the top companies that said Google

395
00:26:39,741 --> 00:26:43,380
versus Amazon, that really would
I think be an extraordinary,

396
00:26:43,530 --> 00:26:47,000
terrible thing for the company if
suddenly seems that you did it safely.

397
00:26:47,001 --> 00:26:51,510
Voice is absolutely aligned of interest
of the consumer and the company against

398
00:26:51,511 --> 00:26:55,420
the hackers and the criminals.
Um,

399
00:26:55,440 --> 00:26:59,250
I was for my birthday last year,
I was in Moscow November 10,

400
00:26:59,640 --> 00:27:02,230
and then met with Putin and uh,

401
00:27:02,240 --> 00:27:06,630
I spent the day with the head of spare
bank, which is the largest bank there,

402
00:27:06,631 --> 00:27:11,400
which he owns a certain part off.
And uh, the head of that bank,

403
00:27:11,450 --> 00:27:15,000
how on graph, very smart individual. Um,

404
00:27:15,330 --> 00:27:20,250
he was caught out half halfway through
and he came back in town. I said,

405
00:27:20,251 --> 00:27:24,950
what happened while we had an attack on
our service and I was thinking, you know,

406
00:27:24,960 --> 00:27:29,340
if any would tax it would be the
Russians or maybe the Tony is so awesome.

407
00:27:29,400 --> 00:27:31,680
So where did it come from?
Of course when the United States,

408
00:27:31,681 --> 00:27:34,910
I mean like where else would recovering
from that it makes you think, Huh,

409
00:27:35,160 --> 00:27:38,690
we do have a certain word who here? It
makes sense once you start thinking about,

410
00:27:40,290 --> 00:27:45,290
so a part of this right to inspect the
refineries means that you can look in

411
00:27:47,010 --> 00:27:51,810
what is being done to use two factor
authentication for email. You know,

412
00:27:51,811 --> 00:27:54,270
do you, I mean there's now these
things we did applied to Google,

413
00:27:54,271 --> 00:27:56,280
but not all companies
are as good as Google.

414
00:27:56,550 --> 00:28:00,990
So that is stickers not for your fridge,

415
00:28:01,420 --> 00:28:03,660
but stick us for your refinery.

416
00:28:04,040 --> 00:28:09,040
Allowing users to make decisions of
whether the rather more convenience like

417
00:28:09,541 --> 00:28:12,240
when his passwords, you know,
you can just direct, you know,

418
00:28:12,300 --> 00:28:16,860
we do email versus a more security.
Let people make the trade off.

419
00:28:18,660 --> 00:28:21,840
The remaining four rights
are the right to amend.

420
00:28:23,070 --> 00:28:27,550
That means I believe, I believe in
democracy. I believe in, you know,

421
00:28:27,630 --> 00:28:28,830
giving people a voice.

422
00:28:28,831 --> 00:28:33,000
I believe in empowering people and not
by controlling how the truth would be.

423
00:28:33,040 --> 00:28:34,350
Alternative facts should be.

424
00:28:34,800 --> 00:28:38,430
So that means let anybody
annotate anything.

425
00:28:39,600 --> 00:28:41,760
So if you think

426
00:28:43,260 --> 00:28:48,260
x about y make a link on y where you
are saying x and then you as the hundred

427
00:28:53,730 --> 00:28:56,160
billion dollar machinery
of relevance ranking,

428
00:28:56,370 --> 00:29:00,030
whether it's Google or whether
it's Amazon recommendations,

429
00:29:00,031 --> 00:29:03,180
Netflix use that hundred
bend or I machinery,

430
00:29:03,181 --> 00:29:07,680
which she was very well for
ads use that for amendments.

431
00:29:08,280 --> 00:29:12,870
So basically anybody should be able to
say anything and quickly things that

432
00:29:12,871 --> 00:29:17,030
actually seem to be right or
interesting maybe you know,

433
00:29:17,160 --> 00:29:21,270
interesting more than right.
They will bubble up and uh,

434
00:29:21,271 --> 00:29:24,150
that is very short.
The right to amend.

435
00:29:26,040 --> 00:29:29,100
Next one,
the second off fees.

436
00:29:29,370 --> 00:29:32,100
Action Rights is the right to blur,

437
00:29:34,110 --> 00:29:39,110
blur judications the best example but
it also works for searches of a products

438
00:29:39,361 --> 00:29:44,361
you buy that you should be in charge
of the radius of the granularity,

439
00:29:46,640 --> 00:29:50,890
the resolution in which data that
concern you can be processed.

440
00:29:52,600 --> 00:29:55,150
In all cases.
It was very,

441
00:29:55,151 --> 00:30:00,151
very important to me is that people
understand the trade offs they are making.

442
00:30:01,270 --> 00:30:03,130
The world is not black or white.

443
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:07,770
So if you say,
I am going to Burma,

444
00:30:07,810 --> 00:30:10,150
geolocation to one kilometer,

445
00:30:10,930 --> 00:30:14,300
don't expect the pizza delivery
man to bring it to your door.

446
00:30:15,850 --> 00:30:20,260
So Hey, if you really want this, then you
can't want that and just live up to it.

447
00:30:20,620 --> 00:30:24,530
But don't live that illusion of these
lottery inconsistencies that you don't

448
00:30:24,531 --> 00:30:25,510
want anybody to know where you are,

449
00:30:25,511 --> 00:30:30,130
but you would like to pizza to be devoted
to one and assess the super trivial

450
00:30:30,131 --> 00:30:30,964
example.

451
00:30:30,970 --> 00:30:35,970
But this right to blur your
data is important for me

452
00:30:40,350 --> 00:30:45,350
and the illusion people have is that
they can sort of blur data at the source.

453
00:30:49,060 --> 00:30:52,870
I don't believe in that.
I think the carriers for instance,

454
00:30:53,320 --> 00:30:58,320
Google of course knows to the resolution
of less than a meter where I'm pretty

455
00:30:58,631 --> 00:30:59,650
much 24,
seven.

456
00:31:01,330 --> 00:31:05,150
It of course knows what time waking up it
of course knows what I'm interested in.

457
00:31:05,151 --> 00:31:07,900
All these things.
You can't do anything at the source.

458
00:31:08,350 --> 00:31:13,350
That's why I think having the right where
you are in charge of figuring out how

459
00:31:14,441 --> 00:31:18,100
precisely you want the things to be known,
that really should be your choice.

460
00:31:19,330 --> 00:31:23,290
Now there is,
um,

461
00:31:23,320 --> 00:31:28,270
there are some interesting things from
psychology. So for instance, weren't up,

462
00:31:28,580 --> 00:31:31,180
uh,
wonder to figure out 20 years ago,

463
00:31:31,360 --> 00:31:33,360
who of you knows what
differential privacies

464
00:31:35,840 --> 00:31:40,780
Soso okay. It's a very important
concept that if I tell you something,

465
00:31:41,290 --> 00:31:43,870
so you can,
let's say as a government for instance,

466
00:31:43,871 --> 00:31:45,610
make it better policy discussion.

467
00:31:46,630 --> 00:31:50,080
I wanted to be protected that
you can't use it against me.

468
00:31:51,160 --> 00:31:55,060
So my belief really is data off
the people, data by the people,

469
00:31:55,270 --> 00:32:00,220
but data for the people.
So if let's say somebody asks,

470
00:32:00,280 --> 00:32:01,510
um,
you know,

471
00:32:03,070 --> 00:32:06,880
as we had with the previous pride
president who took something but he didn't

472
00:32:06,881 --> 00:32:11,830
inhale, so, uh, did you
smoke pot last month?

473
00:32:13,300 --> 00:32:16,600
And let's say you are in a state where
it's illegal smoke point. So if you say,

474
00:32:16,601 --> 00:32:21,190
I did, and then the next day
the police shows up and says,

475
00:32:21,191 --> 00:32:24,100
you said you smoked pot after
prison. I mean, it's not that bad.

476
00:32:24,370 --> 00:32:25,810
But think about other things,

477
00:32:25,960 --> 00:32:30,370
which would be this way that would suck
that you try to have some policy to help

478
00:32:30,371 --> 00:32:31,320
them understanding.

479
00:32:31,630 --> 00:32:36,630
So that die guy called Werner had the
idea that I'd asked you a question about,

480
00:32:37,511 --> 00:32:41,870
don't not say it,
he is a coin and uh,

481
00:32:42,050 --> 00:32:46,010
you flipped the coin and I don't want
to know what would you feel if you get

482
00:32:46,011 --> 00:32:49,760
heads, you say yes, irrespective
of what you really did.

483
00:32:50,600 --> 00:32:52,850
If you get tails,
you have to say the truth.

484
00:32:53,690 --> 00:32:57,740
That's pretty cool because more than
half of the people say yes. So, uh,

485
00:32:57,840 --> 00:33:01,490
it's clear to any prosecutor that
they can't go after these people.

486
00:33:02,120 --> 00:33:04,370
And if we have enough statistics,
you know,

487
00:33:04,400 --> 00:33:09,170
any of you can do the math about how to
figure out the signal given that 50% of

488
00:33:09,171 --> 00:33:13,010
the people only say the truth and the
other cs irrespectively of what actually

489
00:33:13,011 --> 00:33:13,820
happened.

490
00:33:13,820 --> 00:33:18,710
So I encourage you to look a bit
into this differential privacy ideas,

491
00:33:19,010 --> 00:33:24,010
which help us get data for the people
where we set it up in a way that you can't

492
00:33:25,521 --> 00:33:29,180
use it against them. Who would
does it? When you need chrome,

493
00:33:29,450 --> 00:33:31,400
where you are looking at what people do,

494
00:33:31,401 --> 00:33:34,970
where you try to spend a
malware on people's computers.

495
00:33:35,630 --> 00:33:40,250
It's a similar concept where smart people
came up with ways finding out things

496
00:33:40,251 --> 00:33:43,610
about the population which cannot
be used against the individual.

497
00:33:46,790 --> 00:33:48,690
The fifth right

498
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:51,140
is the right,

499
00:33:51,141 --> 00:33:55,840
I wanted to quite have the right to play
and my editor said that is, you know,

500
00:33:55,920 --> 00:34:00,320
maybe not serious enough.
So who we call it the right to experiment.

501
00:34:04,440 --> 00:34:05,530
In 1989,

502
00:34:05,970 --> 00:34:10,970
I started a company called logic it
little startup with the purpose of music

503
00:34:12,481 --> 00:34:13,560
recommendations.

504
00:34:14,310 --> 00:34:19,080
It was an interesting time also with the
founding media of Pandora and they went

505
00:34:19,081 --> 00:34:21,000
different routes.
Um,

506
00:34:22,180 --> 00:34:26,760
how did a company got bought by
or media which would gold by the,

507
00:34:26,840 --> 00:34:27,930
by another company.

508
00:34:28,330 --> 00:34:33,330
So the idea was we want to first of all
figure out not from the metadata part,

509
00:34:36,090 --> 00:34:40,050
from the usage pattern of how
people skip between songs,

510
00:34:40,200 --> 00:34:43,350
what we should recommend and then,

511
00:34:43,920 --> 00:34:46,650
and I really haven't seen that elsewhere.

512
00:34:47,220 --> 00:34:50,040
We want to make explicit to people

513
00:34:52,110 --> 00:34:55,890
the trade off between
exploration and exploitation.

514
00:34:56,790 --> 00:34:58,650
So in machine learning,

515
00:34:59,160 --> 00:35:03,300
one of the things where you can
just hope the system will, you know,

516
00:35:03,301 --> 00:35:07,710
come up with a solution is
whether you should explore more.

517
00:35:08,150 --> 00:35:11,730
I mean you can try out new things that
you don't know where they're good or bad

518
00:35:12,090 --> 00:35:15,300
that you know this one armed
bandit problem in Vegas. You know,

519
00:35:15,301 --> 00:35:17,460
if one machine once gave you some money,

520
00:35:17,580 --> 00:35:21,780
will you spend the rest of the day
on that one machine, POCs, POCs,

521
00:35:22,110 --> 00:35:25,650
or are you going to still explore
some other machines might be bad,

522
00:35:25,680 --> 00:35:29,610
better or might be voice
exploration versus exploitation.

523
00:35:30,450 --> 00:35:35,450
So that is a knob which I think
should be headed to the consumer,

524
00:35:35,550 --> 00:35:37,200
to the user goes,

525
00:35:37,201 --> 00:35:42,201
I know whether I had a stressful day and
all I wanted to some soothing music or

526
00:35:43,681 --> 00:35:47,290
like an airplane, you know, we'll check
in three hours, delay every 10 minutes.

527
00:35:47,290 --> 00:35:49,920
Yeah, update the departure by 10
minutes and you don't sit anywhere.

528
00:35:50,310 --> 00:35:55,310
You really just want something which
is now a quiet or am I in the mood to

529
00:35:55,411 --> 00:36:00,150
explore new stuff? Let me listen to
things I've never listened to before.

530
00:36:00,151 --> 00:36:04,260
Chances are hated, but she has also
are that or discover something new.

531
00:36:04,860 --> 00:36:09,750
So that's one example is when I say do
right to play or the right to experiment

532
00:36:10,080 --> 00:36:15,080
is think how you can expose to the user
some of the knobs where you don't know

533
00:36:19,051 --> 00:36:21,960
the answer as well as use it does.

534
00:36:22,980 --> 00:36:25,200
So exploration expert is one example.

535
00:36:25,860 --> 00:36:30,860
In search advanced search you have a few
options which are a step in the right

536
00:36:31,261 --> 00:36:32,094
direction,

537
00:36:32,130 --> 00:36:37,130
but I think they can read more by helping
people to actually set the privatest

538
00:36:37,191 --> 00:36:41,640
they way they want to set them on
their terms, any given point in time.

539
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:48,840
And then we have all the data,
we've got to look at them.

540
00:36:49,650 --> 00:36:50,880
But that's not enough for me.

541
00:36:52,350 --> 00:36:56,520
I want to be able to
take the data to of ips.

542
00:36:57,900 --> 00:37:00,720
So I call this the right to port.

543
00:37:01,110 --> 00:37:05,220
I would put my data and eh,
we know,

544
00:37:05,221 --> 00:37:08,700
we all know PGP and API closes up.

545
00:37:08,730 --> 00:37:13,730
So just implement it in a reasonable way
that if some other company would offer

546
00:37:14,911 --> 00:37:16,830
a better search product,

547
00:37:17,250 --> 00:37:22,250
then make it easy for me to actually
take my data in a secure way.

548
00:37:22,710 --> 00:37:24,780
Telling them here is what the data is.

549
00:37:25,260 --> 00:37:30,260
And I think it helps the ecosystem because
those companies which are good people

550
00:37:30,661 --> 00:37:34,190
will come back, make it easy for people
to actually put the data on trial.

551
00:37:34,191 --> 00:37:37,800
Something else you can always
learn from who is coming back.

552
00:37:37,830 --> 00:37:40,110
It's another feedback loop
in experiments you're doing.

553
00:37:41,850 --> 00:37:46,850
So that's what I wanted to say about
those six rights which are wrote about in

554
00:37:49,051 --> 00:37:53,940
the book. And I thought she only dodge to
book you on to two days ago. I have not.

555
00:37:53,941 --> 00:37:57,900
We talked about it yet and I've never
really spent as much time except in class

556
00:37:58,290 --> 00:37:59,670
on those rights.

557
00:38:01,200 --> 00:38:04,640
So I want to end

558
00:38:07,320 --> 00:38:12,270
with the couple of things which
I do not have answers for. Great.

559
00:38:12,360 --> 00:38:12,960
So,

560
00:38:12,960 --> 00:38:16,780
uh, questions. Hi. Thank you for
coming. Thanks for having me.

561
00:38:17,200 --> 00:38:21,100
So, uh, when you talk about the
right to blur in particular,

562
00:38:21,130 --> 00:38:26,130
that made me think of one of the current
problems is that a lot of us who come

563
00:38:27,161 --> 00:38:30,490
from fairly privileged backgrounds
thinking about, oh, this is a great,

564
00:38:30,491 --> 00:38:32,800
I can just share my information,
what could possibly go wrong?

565
00:38:33,070 --> 00:38:38,070
But the immense power of doxing has
been shown to be a force against people.

566
00:38:40,540 --> 00:38:45,540
And what's worse is the farther we go
towards the default us sharing all your

567
00:38:45,581 --> 00:38:47,740
information. Oh, but maybe you,

568
00:38:47,741 --> 00:38:50,230
we'll blur your location for
safety and can't get pizza.

569
00:38:50,410 --> 00:38:52,870
You start to create like a
digital underclass, right?

570
00:38:52,871 --> 00:38:57,730
You can force people out of this
glorious data world for their own safety.

571
00:38:58,300 --> 00:39:00,070
Do you,
do you have any thoughts on that?

572
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:02,833
Um,

573
00:39:03,450 --> 00:39:08,450
I think it was a lunch when we talked
about that there was a time when,

574
00:39:09,181 --> 00:39:14,070
for instance, Harvey Milk was
shot. There was a time when,

575
00:39:14,240 --> 00:39:19,020
you know, the first gay bar in San
Francisco, they didn't have windows.

576
00:39:19,560 --> 00:39:22,630
Um, so people could look in. Um,

577
00:39:23,370 --> 00:39:28,370
and I think that social norm norms
ultimately is what determines our attitude

578
00:39:30,811 --> 00:39:33,630
towards many things.
Let me twist it slightly.

579
00:39:34,230 --> 00:39:39,000
Hine who used to be at Google now
runs data for snapchat and a B,

580
00:39:39,001 --> 00:39:40,140
then a couple of weeks.

581
00:39:40,530 --> 00:39:45,530
And I think that's quite interesting that
on the surface you have things being a

582
00:39:45,841 --> 00:39:48,630
femoral, of course, the deep
structures so that the data is there.

583
00:39:49,320 --> 00:39:52,080
Is that ultimately helping or hurting?
And you knew the story,

584
00:39:52,170 --> 00:39:55,530
which was reporting in the Guardian
that it, one of the services.

585
00:39:55,531 --> 00:39:58,410
It was a thing secret. Ehm, you know,

586
00:39:58,411 --> 00:40:02,850
not everything was a s s s Ephemera
as they claimed it was. [inaudible].

587
00:40:03,210 --> 00:40:06,600
So, I don't know. Do
you have any suggestion?

588
00:40:08,400 --> 00:40:12,330
Nope. Still working on that? Yeah. Um,

589
00:40:13,140 --> 00:40:17,610
I um,
right after my phd,

590
00:40:17,980 --> 00:40:22,260
um, I wanted to teach in Thailand
at the university for half a year,

591
00:40:22,680 --> 00:40:26,490
so when to cheer on corn. And, um,

592
00:40:27,780 --> 00:40:32,780
two things I learned from that one
is that my friends told me that his

593
00:40:33,631 --> 00:40:37,440
scientific suicide,
if you are as three things,

594
00:40:37,560 --> 00:40:39,030
one is Peter Norvig.

595
00:40:39,031 --> 00:40:43,440
Andrew knew at the time already scientific
suicide if you are going to be out of

596
00:40:43,441 --> 00:40:47,760
touch for half a year. And you
know, it was a different time.

597
00:40:48,470 --> 00:40:49,303
Um,

598
00:40:50,100 --> 00:40:53,570
so when I came half a year
later back to us to know,

599
00:40:54,030 --> 00:40:56,670
most people had noticed
that actually Wisconsin,

600
00:40:58,510 --> 00:41:01,620
um, uh, those days,

601
00:41:01,720 --> 00:41:06,720
the underclass email go deliver to
Thailand twice a day by dialing taka,

602
00:41:10,550 --> 00:41:11,383
Taka,
Taka.

603
00:41:12,600 --> 00:41:17,600
We one connection to Melbourne from the
Asian Institute of Technology in Bangkok

604
00:41:17,820 --> 00:41:20,640
to Mebane and getting the email
for the country back and forth.

605
00:41:21,690 --> 00:41:26,690
And there was two weeks when we didn't
have email and then some dude showed up

606
00:41:28,351 --> 00:41:29,580
at my office too long gone.

607
00:41:29,940 --> 00:41:33,620
I think I do only Spock station at the
university should up with uh, you know,

608
00:41:33,621 --> 00:41:34,401
I'm not sure whether,
you know,

609
00:41:34,401 --> 00:41:37,890
these cartridges they used to have
sure shows up to the coverages.

610
00:41:38,090 --> 00:41:41,360
This is the email for the
country for the last two weeks.

611
00:41:43,200 --> 00:41:47,030
Uh, so I, uh, I had never, you know,

612
00:41:47,031 --> 00:41:49,550
doubt with SMTP every note
we can learn anything.

613
00:41:49,551 --> 00:41:51,800
So I've posted the obvious thing,

614
00:41:52,160 --> 00:41:57,160
which just I grabbed for my name and like
the first 10 things were other people

615
00:41:57,351 --> 00:42:01,490
talking about me at that stage. I said,
this is not a profit I'm going to solve.

616
00:42:01,700 --> 00:42:05,640
I don't want to know what people are
talking about me, basically, you know. Uh,

617
00:42:06,410 --> 00:42:07,970
I didn't expect that to be able to,

618
00:42:07,971 --> 00:42:11,360
I thought I just see where I'm the two
line and out as quickly scan through

619
00:42:11,361 --> 00:42:12,194
those.

620
00:42:12,960 --> 00:42:16,370
And the search thing
too was that I had hoped

621
00:42:18,170 --> 00:42:19,070
that

622
00:42:20,650 --> 00:42:25,650
the digital divide would
get bridged with those days,

623
00:42:27,921 --> 00:42:30,290
the Internet then you know,

624
00:42:30,500 --> 00:42:35,230
later the web and I am not sure about it.
Um,

625
00:42:35,390 --> 00:42:40,160
what I am sure about is that another
comparison between the US and China is of

626
00:42:40,161 --> 00:42:43,370
course the great firewall.

627
00:42:43,970 --> 00:42:48,710
It clearly makes my life worse.
Every time I go to China.

628
00:42:49,340 --> 00:42:51,300
It is last time the Latin male,

629
00:42:51,410 --> 00:42:56,300
they're like six weeks a year and asked
time was less happy than ever because

630
00:42:56,301 --> 00:42:59,870
things which used to be easy,
just becoming incredibly hard.

631
00:43:00,320 --> 00:43:05,320
And even things like using apps in
China like dd which is you are the lifts

632
00:43:05,641 --> 00:43:09,100
equivalent. If you don't read
Chinese, you got us host.

633
00:43:10,560 --> 00:43:13,940
Another question. Uh, you talked about uh,

634
00:43:14,030 --> 00:43:16,980
the right to annotate the right to a man,

635
00:43:17,810 --> 00:43:20,680
but what about the truth?
Uh,

636
00:43:21,290 --> 00:43:26,210
should they not have the
right to read FECC based?

637
00:43:26,390 --> 00:43:28,100
Very tricky.
I totally agree.

638
00:43:28,101 --> 00:43:31,640
And I was sort of halfway
mentioned fake fake news before.

639
00:43:33,410 --> 00:43:37,970
I believe, as I said, that
be $100 billion engine,

640
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:42,170
which we have figured out
for search relevance that
that can also figure out the

641
00:43:42,171 --> 00:43:44,540
truth if we wanted.
Yeah,

642
00:43:44,690 --> 00:43:47,780
that's my believe in if we
have enough data sources,

643
00:43:48,110 --> 00:43:52,130
if you have the identity
of people who postings,

644
00:43:52,340 --> 00:43:56,290
if you know that desk person thinking
about Wikipedia who gets reverted and

645
00:43:56,291 --> 00:43:59,750
stuff, I guess I think we
can build pretty good models.

646
00:44:00,260 --> 00:44:04,130
It will never be perfect,
but what is the alternative?

647
00:44:05,240 --> 00:44:07,010
So it is not that.

648
00:44:07,040 --> 00:44:10,100
The alternative is that we have Donald
Trump telling us how it really is,

649
00:44:10,460 --> 00:44:13,550
but the alternative is that you know,
some random stuff, what happened,

650
00:44:13,551 --> 00:44:14,480
I believe in,

651
00:44:14,780 --> 00:44:19,310
in in masters and intelligent machines
and editors or freaking out what actually

652
00:44:19,311 --> 00:44:22,850
is a more likely version of the truth.
Then one person dictating it.

653
00:44:23,690 --> 00:44:26,930
But that brings me to one of the
two heart problems at the end,

654
00:44:27,380 --> 00:44:28,810
which is the question of identity.

655
00:44:29,960 --> 00:44:34,960
So underlying here is that you have your
Gmail account or you have your Amazon

656
00:44:37,531 --> 00:44:41,920
account. So when you write those reviews
about my book to dimension reviews them,

657
00:44:42,270 --> 00:44:46,590
when you write those reviews,
then your identity is there.

658
00:44:46,650 --> 00:44:48,480
And actually I went as an Amazon,

659
00:44:48,481 --> 00:44:53,481
we had very good discussions with
Jeff basis where I was wrong.

660
00:44:54,330 --> 00:44:59,330
I believe juice ref pseudonyms
because I did not want actually,

661
00:44:59,971 --> 00:45:03,240
you know, a colleague if I write
a bad review about his book,

662
00:45:03,450 --> 00:45:06,450
knowing that that is undress and
you know, that would not, you know,

663
00:45:06,451 --> 00:45:08,640
really further our
relationship or that much.

664
00:45:09,120 --> 00:45:14,010
I really believe to pseudonyms and
Jeff says, no, we need real names.

665
00:45:14,220 --> 00:45:18,570
So Facebook probably gave him
right that, you know, real names.

666
00:45:18,870 --> 00:45:20,580
It's an open question.
I don't have no,

667
00:45:20,660 --> 00:45:25,050
I just want to say the question about
should one institution hold, uh,

668
00:45:25,080 --> 00:45:27,510
the identity,
what should that institution be?

669
00:45:28,440 --> 00:45:32,130
In my last class I had
in Brooklyn in November,

670
00:45:32,160 --> 00:45:34,500
I had two wonderful guest speakers.

671
00:45:35,250 --> 00:45:40,250
One former NSA employee and a
lawyer for the Acru David Holtzman.

672
00:45:44,941 --> 00:45:47,910
He wrote a wonderful book called
privacy loss 10 years ago.

673
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:51,960
He knows what he's talking
about and Nicole Ozar,

674
00:45:52,320 --> 00:45:55,290
wonderful person went to
Berkeley Law who really,

675
00:45:55,291 --> 00:45:57,870
Austin knows what she knows.

676
00:45:57,871 --> 00:46:02,670
And she busted a few operations where,
you know,

677
00:46:02,671 --> 00:46:07,140
Facebook for instance, handed over
via some third party company, um,

678
00:46:07,170 --> 00:46:09,860
data to the law enforcement so they could,
you know,

679
00:46:09,870 --> 00:46:12,420
use your spare resources better.
You know,

680
00:46:13,290 --> 00:46:17,280
so we had the conversation ended
accumulate in the question, which I asked.

681
00:46:18,510 --> 00:46:19,680
So it was my youtube channel,

682
00:46:19,681 --> 00:46:24,681
youtube.com/social data revolution and
the repeated in Moscow for Putin in front

683
00:46:25,141 --> 00:46:28,080
of that audience.
Who Do you think will be around longer?

684
00:46:29,670 --> 00:46:32,700
The oldest states of America or Google?

685
00:46:33,810 --> 00:46:36,180
Almost all the students believed Google.

686
00:46:38,400 --> 00:46:41,250
But then in the bigger picture,
to come to my last point,

687
00:46:43,340 --> 00:46:47,520
you know,
good or played on 2000 years ago,

688
00:46:47,940 --> 00:46:50,700
he talked about the allegory of the cave.

689
00:46:51,750 --> 00:46:56,040
And the idea was that people in his case,
prisoners,

690
00:46:56,041 --> 00:47:00,180
I don't like that matter metaphor much,
but prisoners for him, we're sitting,

691
00:47:01,140 --> 00:47:04,920
they couldn't move their heads for the
entire lives and they were only looking

692
00:47:05,130 --> 00:47:09,300
at the wall of a cave.
And that ball had shadows,

693
00:47:09,301 --> 00:47:13,410
as we would call them,
had dark things projected.

694
00:47:13,460 --> 00:47:16,230
There was a light source behind them.
You know,

695
00:47:16,231 --> 00:47:20,940
like you don't denied somebody if they
didn't have that concept cause all this

696
00:47:20,941 --> 00:47:25,050
or where the shadows on the wall,
no shadows were puppets.

697
00:47:25,051 --> 00:47:29,010
Maybe some holes Kang Round, or maybe
were people behind them. They didn't know.

698
00:47:30,010 --> 00:47:33,520
And there were certain laws which
they figured out, for instance,

699
00:47:33,820 --> 00:47:38,170
not tool or nonfat fatty Altus seem
to the Romans who would've said later,

700
00:47:38,171 --> 00:47:40,780
which means nature doesn't jump around.

701
00:47:41,080 --> 00:47:45,470
So there was continuity in those
shadows in there, had their, would you,

702
00:47:46,060 --> 00:47:50,010
they pat their stories about that.
They couldn't turn their heads, but,

703
00:47:50,440 --> 00:47:53,770
and then one of the
prisoners were set free.

704
00:47:55,210 --> 00:47:58,540
So he left war.

705
00:47:59,110 --> 00:48:03,280
There was all that light
out there and it hurt him.

706
00:48:03,920 --> 00:48:08,060
He, he, and he went back
and said, that's it. No,

707
00:48:08,200 --> 00:48:09,070
not doing that again.

708
00:48:10,540 --> 00:48:15,520
So the word we live in is the
world according to Google.

709
00:48:18,760 --> 00:48:23,470
The word we live in the West is
the word according to Facebook.

710
00:48:25,030 --> 00:48:30,030
So all I can say is use
that responsibility wisely.

711
00:48:31,930 --> 00:48:32,320
Thank you.
