1
00:00:06,110 --> 00:00:11,110
I'm excited that our talk here
and San Francisco is Mitch Altman.

2
00:00:16,690 --> 00:00:17,590
Yay.

3
00:00:19,660 --> 00:00:19,960
Uh,

4
00:00:19,960 --> 00:00:24,960
is good for San Francisco taught cause
he embodies so many of those classic San

5
00:00:25,220 --> 00:00:30,220
Francisco ideals of exploring
and experimenting and
being creative and figuring

6
00:00:31,401 --> 00:00:35,590
out how to live a life
true to your ideals. Um,

7
00:00:35,660 --> 00:00:39,970
so founder of Knightsbridge cofounder,

8
00:00:40,010 --> 00:00:45,010
noise bridge or local epic hackerspace
and CEO of Cornfield electronics with all

9
00:00:47,631 --> 00:00:52,160
these cool toys that people
here can play with after,

10
00:00:52,980 --> 00:00:55,520
um,
take it away.

11
00:01:03,310 --> 00:01:04,143
Great.

12
00:01:04,630 --> 00:01:09,630
Thanks everyone for coming and hate
everyone who is watching remotely.

13
00:01:10,270 --> 00:01:14,950
Hi. Um, I'm going to go
back to the slides now. Um,

14
00:01:15,370 --> 00:01:17,860
so this is my contact info.

15
00:01:18,370 --> 00:01:21,340
Please feel free to contact
me anytime for any reason.

16
00:01:21,700 --> 00:01:25,540
I'm totally happy to help
any way I can always.

17
00:01:26,260 --> 00:01:27,220
So,
um,

18
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:34,680
I'm going to be talking about a lot
of stuff that is totally my opinion.

19
00:01:35,081 --> 00:01:39,160
Obviously. Even if it sounds
like I'm saying it emphatically,

20
00:01:39,161 --> 00:01:43,240
it's still obviously just my opinion and
I don't expect everyone here to agree

21
00:01:43,241 --> 00:01:46,720
with everything I say. But,
um, you know, we, we, we,

22
00:01:46,750 --> 00:01:49,300
we can learn from the
experience of others for sure,

23
00:01:49,301 --> 00:01:53,260
but in order to live a
life that each of us,

24
00:01:53,290 --> 00:01:56,350
in order to live a life that
you feel is totally awesome,

25
00:01:56,530 --> 00:01:59,860
you got to do things in
your own way. And, um,

26
00:02:00,130 --> 00:02:05,130
and that's often not what a conventional
wisdom tells us is the thing to do.

27
00:02:05,800 --> 00:02:10,390
Um, so yeah, so it's just my opinions. Um,

28
00:02:10,870 --> 00:02:15,870
and my talk today is about doing things
together and it's really about community

29
00:02:18,040 --> 00:02:21,940
and the need for community.
We can do so much on our own.

30
00:02:22,180 --> 00:02:25,030
We've got big brains where
we got these big brains.

31
00:02:25,031 --> 00:02:28,510
There are sometimes problematic,
but they're cool. Uh, we
can do a lot on her own,

32
00:02:28,511 --> 00:02:31,990
but when we put our big brains together,
we create something way bigger,

33
00:02:32,440 --> 00:02:35,590
way bigger than the sum of our parts.
And that's why we have, you know,

34
00:02:35,591 --> 00:02:39,730
like companies and things. That's one
of the good things about companies.

35
00:02:40,540 --> 00:02:45,180
There's a lot of things we can't do
on our own though. Um, like here's a,

36
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:49,180
some high school kids that I met in China,
uh,

37
00:02:49,181 --> 00:02:52,540
who were invited there.
They knew nothing about all this physics,

38
00:02:52,541 --> 00:02:55,720
but each person knew some things
and they had some mentors there.

39
00:02:55,930 --> 00:02:59,940
And collectively knowing, starting
from nothing, they made a, um,

40
00:03:00,070 --> 00:03:04,870
an atomic force microscope
out of Legos. And, um,

41
00:03:05,170 --> 00:03:07,930
there's other things we
can't do on her own as well.

42
00:03:07,931 --> 00:03:11,710
Like I'm having a pillow fight of
thousands of people in San Francisco,

43
00:03:11,711 --> 00:03:15,490
which happens every year. Um,
lots of fun things. We do,

44
00:03:15,491 --> 00:03:17,500
much more cool when we're together,

45
00:03:18,520 --> 00:03:22,630
but we're not all that good at doing
things together on our modern world.

46
00:03:23,110 --> 00:03:23,590
Um,

47
00:03:23,590 --> 00:03:28,590
it's Kinda hard and that's because most
of us weren't fortunate enough to be

48
00:03:30,071 --> 00:03:35,071
raised in a loving community where we
got all our needs are most of our needs

49
00:03:35,231 --> 00:03:39,820
met, where we grew up, always knowing
that it's okay to be our own unique,

50
00:03:39,821 --> 00:03:43,360
weird cells.
Most of us didn't have that,

51
00:03:43,750 --> 00:03:46,120
but we need community

52
00:03:47,860 --> 00:03:49,750
back at the beginning of our species,

53
00:03:51,250 --> 00:03:56,250
we evolved coming together in community.

54
00:03:56,710 --> 00:04:01,710
That's because we didn't have huge
muscles and big strength and scary roars.

55
00:04:02,510 --> 00:04:03,040
Um,

56
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:07,990
we have big brains and we put our big
brains together and we support ourselves

57
00:04:08,260 --> 00:04:10,930
in community. And, um,

58
00:04:11,470 --> 00:04:13,450
even though I am back then,

59
00:04:13,451 --> 00:04:18,451
we needed to do that in order to
survive in an often hostile environment,

60
00:04:22,640 --> 00:04:26,330
need weed, even though now we
don't need that just to survive.

61
00:04:26,780 --> 00:04:31,490
We do need that to feel part of
something bigger than ourselves,

62
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:36,200
to feel worthwhile,
to have thriving in our lives.

63
00:04:36,201 --> 00:04:39,290
We need to feel we're part of
something bigger than ourselves.

64
00:04:40,730 --> 00:04:45,140
We need that. And yet in our modern
world, there's so precious little of it.

65
00:04:46,010 --> 00:04:48,770
So we just try looking
for it where we can,

66
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:53,750
we try getting it from our families
of origin. That works for some people.

67
00:04:54,270 --> 00:04:58,310
That didn't work so well for me. Um, but
if it weren't for you, that's fantastic.

68
00:04:58,311 --> 00:05:00,250
That's a great resource.
Um,

69
00:05:00,530 --> 00:05:03,950
for many people they can find
it from their places of worship.

70
00:05:04,940 --> 00:05:07,190
It also doesn't work for
me or we need people.

71
00:05:07,191 --> 00:05:11,700
I know we try to create our own perhaps.
But you know, finding community is,

72
00:05:11,701 --> 00:05:15,680
is difficult. Schools at their
best can give us some community,

73
00:05:15,681 --> 00:05:19,190
but quite often the schools
are more like that. Um,

74
00:05:19,580 --> 00:05:24,320
and then we try to find it at work.
Uh, Google I hope is better than this.

75
00:05:24,860 --> 00:05:27,410
I don't know what you feel
like personally, but, um,

76
00:05:27,740 --> 00:05:30,980
we try to find it at work and
we can get some there. But, uh,

77
00:05:31,130 --> 00:05:35,630
we try to get it from TV.
That's one of my favorite things to hate.

78
00:05:35,990 --> 00:05:36,823
Um,

79
00:05:36,950 --> 00:05:41,180
here's a whole bunch of people alone
watching something seemingly together.

80
00:05:41,510 --> 00:05:43,730
Um, and, uh,

81
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:46,790
the people on TV seemed to be friends,

82
00:05:46,791 --> 00:05:48,830
but they don't even
know these people exist.

83
00:05:48,831 --> 00:05:51,710
Therefore they can't care about it
and friends care about each other.

84
00:05:51,711 --> 00:05:55,910
This is not community and the Internet,
we tried to get it on the Internet,

85
00:05:55,911 --> 00:05:58,040
but the Internet usually like this.

86
00:06:01,190 --> 00:06:05,490
We need it. We need community,
but we don't really have it. Uh,

87
00:06:05,760 --> 00:06:10,010
I don't know about you, but like
as a geek, when I was a little kid,

88
00:06:10,011 --> 00:06:14,780
it was dangerous to be a geek and I was
beaten up and bullied all the time as a

89
00:06:14,781 --> 00:06:19,730
Geeky kid. And, um, every day
at school I was beaten up.

90
00:06:19,870 --> 00:06:24,170
I did not have community.
I was terrified of humans because humans,

91
00:06:24,171 --> 00:06:29,171
men's people who are going to beat me
up often while the gym teacher watched,

92
00:06:31,670 --> 00:06:35,300
I don't know what it takes to
be a gym teacher, but uh, uh,

93
00:06:35,301 --> 00:06:40,080
so my parents were no help. They
were just totally depressed too. Uh,

94
00:06:40,100 --> 00:06:44,900
so my life was total hell as a kid
and when I got home I escaped into the

95
00:06:44,901 --> 00:06:48,590
magical world of television.
Right. Tried to, anyways,

96
00:06:48,591 --> 00:06:52,820
of course these things never work.
But um, as long as the TV show is on,

97
00:06:52,821 --> 00:06:57,590
I could seemingly forget about my
horrible depressed existence. Um,

98
00:06:57,770 --> 00:07:02,770
which made me more depressed because I
would compare myself to the kids on TV

99
00:07:03,081 --> 00:07:04,940
who were beautiful,
had loving parents,

100
00:07:05,180 --> 00:07:09,350
understanding friends and problems that
always resolved by the end of 30 minutes

101
00:07:09,351 --> 00:07:12,950
show comparing myself to
that was horribly depressing.

102
00:07:12,951 --> 00:07:15,860
I wasn't doing anything useful.
I wasn't going out and doing things.

103
00:07:15,861 --> 00:07:17,600
I wasn't learning how
to deal with other kids.

104
00:07:17,750 --> 00:07:21,320
I was eating junk food like
the commercials were telling
me to do and showing me

105
00:07:21,321 --> 00:07:24,410
to do. And I wanted all these
toys that I couldn't get.

106
00:07:24,830 --> 00:07:29,830
And I became more of a target because
I was fat and it totally unable to deal

107
00:07:30,771 --> 00:07:31,491
with humans.

108
00:07:31,491 --> 00:07:35,870
And I'm more of a targeted school only
to try to escape more in the TV when I

109
00:07:35,871 --> 00:07:38,690
got home.
And that is addiction.

110
00:07:39,220 --> 00:07:43,900
It was the first addiction of mine. I
became really good at addiction. Uh,

111
00:07:43,910 --> 00:07:48,560
that's another story though. Um, but
I did eventually quit television,

112
00:07:48,980 --> 00:07:52,740
um,
in 1980 and um,

113
00:07:52,970 --> 00:07:55,290
I started doing all these things,
uh,

114
00:07:55,291 --> 00:07:58,010
more of all these things that
I had already been doing,

115
00:07:58,011 --> 00:08:00,740
like doing these geeky things,
which would really,

116
00:08:00,741 --> 00:08:04,370
really cool and I could make all these
things and make things happen and I could,

117
00:08:04,371 --> 00:08:08,000
uh, uh, I got really good at it.

118
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:11,950
I got really good at it enough
so that later in life, um,

119
00:08:11,990 --> 00:08:15,890
I could become a consultant and help
small companies with their electronic

120
00:08:15,891 --> 00:08:18,380
problems,
usually with little boards,

121
00:08:18,381 --> 00:08:22,460
with microcontrollers and I did a
whole bunch of different things. Um,

122
00:08:22,550 --> 00:08:24,850
and through the years,
um,

123
00:08:25,490 --> 00:08:30,080
I eventually learned to live a life that
was appropriate for me and I was making

124
00:08:30,081 --> 00:08:32,840
enough money doing consulting
for small companies,

125
00:08:33,920 --> 00:08:35,150
doing lots of interesting things.

126
00:08:35,151 --> 00:08:38,930
And I'll come back to that later because
it's relevant to what I'm going to talk

127
00:08:38,931 --> 00:08:42,200
about with community and hackerspaces.
Um,

128
00:08:42,710 --> 00:08:47,120
so the thing is we do
need to feel community.

129
00:08:47,121 --> 00:08:50,750
We need to feel part of something bigger
than ourselves. And because of that,

130
00:08:51,470 --> 00:08:55,350
we don't end. Since we don't have it,
we can be manipulated by this need.

131
00:08:55,760 --> 00:08:56,760
And in our modern world,

132
00:08:56,761 --> 00:09:01,410
there are all sorts of ways that were
manipulated in a grade school and high.

133
00:09:01,411 --> 00:09:04,770
Unfortunately for adults
sometimes as well, um,

134
00:09:05,160 --> 00:09:08,220
people band together and bullies,
they're afraid of the bullies.

135
00:09:08,221 --> 00:09:10,680
Everyone's terrified of being
singled out by the bullies.

136
00:09:10,681 --> 00:09:14,490
You don't want to be like
that, that little kid over
there who's being beaten up.

137
00:09:14,491 --> 00:09:17,340
So quite often we join
in with the bullies.

138
00:09:18,390 --> 00:09:23,340
It's not fun,
but people have to laugh at it anyways.

139
00:09:25,800 --> 00:09:30,150
I don't know what football's all about.
Like it's totally like whatever.

140
00:09:30,151 --> 00:09:34,320
But people seem to go into that and then
they start screaming the same thing at

141
00:09:34,321 --> 00:09:37,320
the same time. They seem to
know it. They, when to do that.

142
00:09:37,860 --> 00:09:40,170
I'll never understand that.
If that works for you, great.

143
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:44,400
But people aren't seem to be manipulated
with that sometimes too. And imagine,

144
00:09:44,401 --> 00:09:44,731
you know,

145
00:09:44,731 --> 00:09:49,140
you're in a big square where someone's
a really good speaker and everyone is

146
00:09:49,141 --> 00:09:53,280
thrusting out little red books in
Tiananmen Square way back in the day.

147
00:09:53,490 --> 00:09:56,790
That must have been really high.
Of course,

148
00:09:56,791 --> 00:09:59,610
the end result wasn't so good.
It didn't end too well.

149
00:09:59,611 --> 00:10:01,140
This also didn't end too well,

150
00:10:01,141 --> 00:10:04,500
but it must have been super high to have
a million people in Nuremberg thrusting

151
00:10:04,501 --> 00:10:07,410
out your arms this way.
Again,

152
00:10:07,411 --> 00:10:11,100
people being manipulated by
our need for community. Um,

153
00:10:11,190 --> 00:10:16,190
wars are also this many people after going
into a war of said it's the best time

154
00:10:16,711 --> 00:10:19,710
of their life, not because they
love killing people necessarily,

155
00:10:19,711 --> 00:10:23,580
but because they were emotionally
engaged and supporting each other for the

156
00:10:23,581 --> 00:10:26,280
first time in their life.
But for this end,

157
00:10:27,660 --> 00:10:30,000
we can do something
better than all of these.

158
00:10:31,800 --> 00:10:36,800
I've been going to hacker conferences
since 2006 and giving talks small and big

159
00:10:37,621 --> 00:10:41,610
and uh, workshops, small and big
and they are way more positive.

160
00:10:41,850 --> 00:10:45,590
We can come together with our need
for being part of something bigger and

161
00:10:45,591 --> 00:10:47,610
something that is inspiring,

162
00:10:47,611 --> 00:10:51,690
something that helps people grow and
learn and do all sorts of cool things.

163
00:10:53,190 --> 00:10:56,920
That one was in Brazil. This
is me teaching 50 people
how to solve the riddle,

164
00:10:57,300 --> 00:11:00,980
a hacker conference in Germany.
It's at the end of December every year.

165
00:11:00,990 --> 00:11:04,680
I know that's coming up this time. The
35th one they've been doing this a while.

166
00:11:04,681 --> 00:11:08,670
They're really good at it.
It's, it's amazing. So anyways,

167
00:11:09,090 --> 00:11:12,690
it's really cool and all I'm doing
is teaching them how to solder

168
00:11:14,760 --> 00:11:15,470
big deal.

169
00:11:15,470 --> 00:11:18,500
They're just melting a little bit of metal
and they can make a blinky light look,

170
00:11:18,501 --> 00:11:19,334
they're happy.

171
00:11:20,690 --> 00:11:24,170
All you have to do is bring people
together with something they feel is

172
00:11:24,171 --> 00:11:27,110
enjoyable and people
have an enjoyable time.

173
00:11:27,430 --> 00:11:29,580
Hacker spaces are the everyday,

174
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:34,070
every night version of this in your own
local area and there were thousands of

175
00:11:34,071 --> 00:11:37,070
them in the world and
they do that really well.

176
00:11:37,700 --> 00:11:41,360
So hackerspaces what are they?
Well,

177
00:11:42,020 --> 00:11:45,650
they're way cooler than any
Internet meme you can think of.

178
00:11:45,870 --> 00:11:50,660
There are physical places where people
come together and supportive community.

179
00:11:50,661 --> 00:11:54,700
Everyone's encouraged to explore and
do what they find meaningful and doing.

180
00:11:56,050 --> 00:11:59,440
That's it. It doesn't matter
what those activities are.

181
00:12:00,010 --> 00:12:03,190
It's places where people do
this and it's super enjoyable.

182
00:12:03,730 --> 00:12:08,260
It's really about the community.
Whatever the activities are is my, uh,

183
00:12:08,261 --> 00:12:12,190
opinion is really just the excuse for
people to come together because we need

184
00:12:12,191 --> 00:12:15,070
that. And when people are coming
together and a hackerspace,

185
00:12:15,190 --> 00:12:20,190
they probably are going to come up with
all sorts of cool tools to do the things

186
00:12:20,321 --> 00:12:24,880
that they want to try doing. And
um, there are a lot of cool tools,

187
00:12:24,881 --> 00:12:28,750
but it's not about the tools.
Again, it's about the community.

188
00:12:28,990 --> 00:12:32,020
Get that community. Okay. So, um,

189
00:12:32,230 --> 00:12:35,530
but hackerspaces do come up
with lots of amazing tools,

190
00:12:35,920 --> 00:12:37,270
all sorts of amazing things.

191
00:12:37,271 --> 00:12:39,940
And people usually think that they
hear hacker space, maker space,

192
00:12:39,941 --> 00:12:43,440
whatever they think of tech.
And there's plenty of tech to go around.

193
00:12:43,450 --> 00:12:45,040
Lots of amazingly cool stuff.

194
00:12:45,041 --> 00:12:49,060
And these are just some of the things
that I make to teach people electronics

195
00:12:49,660 --> 00:12:53,200
and soldering. Excuse me. And uh,
but there's much more than that.

196
00:12:53,260 --> 00:12:56,890
It was so many activities and depends
on the people who start and run a

197
00:12:56,891 --> 00:13:00,700
hackerspace, what kind of activities go
on, which means what kind of tools or are,

198
00:13:00,970 --> 00:13:04,900
and so there can be fabrication tools
for building amazing things with laser

199
00:13:04,901 --> 00:13:09,490
cutters and three d printers and a wood
and metal and plastic. There can be,

200
00:13:09,750 --> 00:13:10,000
uh,

201
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:14,950
all sorts of things for art
and craft like this or music.

202
00:13:15,390 --> 00:13:19,000
Um, food, food hacking is amazing. Uh,

203
00:13:19,001 --> 00:13:22,660
biology and science and math
and whatever people want to do.

204
00:13:24,190 --> 00:13:28,480
But again, it's about
community. And here again,

205
00:13:28,481 --> 00:13:32,320
some happy people who I'm
teaching to solder, they're happy

206
00:13:33,970 --> 00:13:37,240
and it's for people of all ages,
old and young.

207
00:13:38,050 --> 00:13:42,340
And it doesn't matter if people ever do
what I'm teaching them or anyone else's

208
00:13:42,341 --> 00:13:45,850
teaching them. Just the act of
coming together inspires people.

209
00:13:46,060 --> 00:13:49,080
And if they make something and it
does something they think is cool,

210
00:13:49,081 --> 00:13:50,980
it gives people a sense of accomplishment.

211
00:13:51,250 --> 00:13:55,390
It gives people a sense of confidence
that they bring forward for the rest of

212
00:13:55,391 --> 00:13:56,350
their lives.

213
00:13:57,010 --> 00:14:02,010
And who knows what people do with that
in their lives once they have that.

214
00:14:02,950 --> 00:14:06,790
And um, yeah, it's amazing.
It's actually magic.

215
00:14:07,810 --> 00:14:12,070
So I do want to mention that I'm calling
these things hackerspaces but people

216
00:14:12,071 --> 00:14:15,310
can also call them makerspaces,
fab labs or whatever.

217
00:14:15,310 --> 00:14:19,660
There are all these different names.
It doesn't matter which name you use,

218
00:14:19,661 --> 00:14:24,130
as long as they're places where people
are supported by their community to

219
00:14:24,131 --> 00:14:26,380
explore and do what they
think is really cool.

220
00:14:27,070 --> 00:14:31,150
I like the word hacker space because
it's not about making a thing,

221
00:14:31,180 --> 00:14:34,720
making a thing is great,
but it's much more than making a thing.

222
00:14:35,140 --> 00:14:39,700
It's about coming together and
supporting each other and doing it.

223
00:14:39,701 --> 00:14:44,560
Cause it's wonderful. I like
the word hacker space. Again,
it's the original words.

224
00:14:44,561 --> 00:14:48,400
So that's the one I'm using and since
I'm using hackerspace and involves the

225
00:14:48,401 --> 00:14:51,800
word hacking, again, there's
many definitions for this.

226
00:14:52,100 --> 00:14:56,720
The word hacking was used
by the mainstream media to
talk about people breaking

227
00:14:56,721 --> 00:15:01,130
into computers and stealing stuff.
That is not what we do at hackerspaces.

228
00:15:01,340 --> 00:15:05,510
If anyone does that at hackerspace, uh,
and they get caught, they get booted.

229
00:15:06,080 --> 00:15:09,770
So, um, it's not really helping
people to come together.

230
00:15:10,010 --> 00:15:15,010
So hacking in my way of looking at it
is really seeing the world as full of

231
00:15:17,181 --> 00:15:20,480
resources.
Our world is full of resources.

232
00:15:20,960 --> 00:15:23,330
There's all sorts of things.
There's things we can buy,

233
00:15:23,331 --> 00:15:25,070
there's things that other
people have thrown away.

234
00:15:25,071 --> 00:15:28,190
There's all sorts of things we can use
and we can use them for any purpose we

235
00:15:28,191 --> 00:15:28,850
want.

236
00:15:28,850 --> 00:15:32,070
It doesn't have to be for the purpose
that it was intended for by the people or

237
00:15:32,090 --> 00:15:33,290
companies that created it.

238
00:15:33,470 --> 00:15:37,580
We can use all of this for our projects
to improve them. We can see what works,

239
00:15:37,700 --> 00:15:38,660
what doesn't work,

240
00:15:38,870 --> 00:15:43,670
and then we can learn from that
and share that with other people.

241
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,520
And that is what hacking is all about.

242
00:15:46,521 --> 00:15:50,750
And that's the definition that was created
in MIT at the model railroad club in

243
00:15:50,751 --> 00:15:55,010
1953 before people really
even heard of computers.

244
00:15:55,820 --> 00:15:57,080
So it's not about computers,

245
00:15:57,081 --> 00:16:00,860
it's a way of looking at things
and being a way of being.

246
00:16:01,100 --> 00:16:05,090
And we do all of this because
it's incredibly enjoyable.

247
00:16:05,870 --> 00:16:08,840
And if you're a geek like me,
we have to do this.

248
00:16:09,080 --> 00:16:11,300
So it really is a way of living.

249
00:16:11,570 --> 00:16:14,900
And that's another reason why I like the
word hacker space rather than just make

250
00:16:14,901 --> 00:16:16,580
her space.
Um,

251
00:16:16,940 --> 00:16:21,690
you don't have to be an
entrepreneur if you're a hacker. Um,

252
00:16:21,770 --> 00:16:24,290
but if you're going to
be a good entrepreneur,

253
00:16:24,770 --> 00:16:28,400
you do have to be a good hacker.
You must,

254
00:16:28,401 --> 00:16:31,970
you must go out and see things and what
works and do things your own way and be

255
00:16:31,971 --> 00:16:35,510
supported and share.
This is what makes a good entrepreneur.

256
00:16:35,511 --> 00:16:39,230
And I'm going to mention something about
entrepreneurship because that's part of

257
00:16:39,231 --> 00:16:42,140
hackerspaces not all of
it, but part of it. Uh,

258
00:16:42,141 --> 00:16:46,760
and you've probably noticed that in our
world that there are a lot of startups.

259
00:16:46,761 --> 00:16:51,761
Now we are in San Francisco where there
are a lot of startups and unfortunately

260
00:16:52,071 --> 00:16:54,020
almost all of them are stupid.

261
00:16:56,580 --> 00:17:00,920
I'll talk more about that later too.
So I am against stupid startups.

262
00:17:00,921 --> 00:17:04,160
I want people to do something meaningful
and worthwhile and put that into their

263
00:17:04,161 --> 00:17:07,370
world. So anyways, what can
be hacked? It's not just tech.

264
00:17:07,371 --> 00:17:09,590
Of course there's tech
and electronics involved,

265
00:17:09,591 --> 00:17:12,740
but there's art and craft and
music and science and yourself.

266
00:17:12,741 --> 00:17:16,070
We need to hack ourselves.
We're going to improve and live our lives.

267
00:17:16,190 --> 00:17:19,280
We need to hack our communities and
continually grow. See what works,

268
00:17:19,281 --> 00:17:21,620
what doesn't,
and make our communities better.

269
00:17:21,800 --> 00:17:25,430
We hack the planet because the
planet needs improvement as well.

270
00:17:25,760 --> 00:17:29,450
Everything can be improved,
everything can and should be hacked.

271
00:17:30,710 --> 00:17:33,680
Everything including education.

272
00:17:34,010 --> 00:17:37,580
And this is one of the reasons why a
hacker spaces are getting so much, uh,

273
00:17:37,581 --> 00:17:41,600
attention in the last many years and
why they've grown so much is because

274
00:17:41,601 --> 00:17:43,460
they're fantastic learning environments.

275
00:17:43,580 --> 00:17:45,620
Education doesn't have to look like this.

276
00:17:45,800 --> 00:17:48,770
Education is not taking tests,

277
00:17:49,140 --> 00:17:52,440
taking tests as about a
valuation of learning supposedly.

278
00:17:52,560 --> 00:17:54,860
But now school is only about the test.

279
00:17:54,861 --> 00:17:57,570
The thing you were supposed to
be having only for evaluation.

280
00:17:57,720 --> 00:18:00,600
People are being trained
for taking the test.

281
00:18:00,780 --> 00:18:05,780
That's like Volkswagen changing the test
for getting a good grade and their GPA

282
00:18:08,490 --> 00:18:09,330
doesn't work.

283
00:18:09,390 --> 00:18:14,390
All it does is make people into good
test takers if they're good at it.

284
00:18:15,330 --> 00:18:20,310
So is this education?
Yes. Is it good education?

285
00:18:20,760 --> 00:18:23,790
Now, can we do better? Absolutely.

286
00:18:25,080 --> 00:18:28,560
If people are motivated to
learn than people learn.

287
00:18:28,740 --> 00:18:31,950
Learning is fun.
We're doing this our whole lives.

288
00:18:32,100 --> 00:18:35,370
If we go to a place like a hacker space
where people are being encouraged to

289
00:18:35,371 --> 00:18:37,020
explore and do things that are meaningful,

290
00:18:37,021 --> 00:18:40,590
that are fun and enjoyable than
we find projects that are cool.

291
00:18:40,680 --> 00:18:43,140
And when we find a project
where we think is cool,

292
00:18:43,260 --> 00:18:44,790
we want to learn as much as we can.

293
00:18:44,790 --> 00:18:48,000
We're motivated to learn as much as
we can to make our projects awesome.

294
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:53,220
That's project based hands,
hands on, play based learning.

295
00:18:53,250 --> 00:18:54,900
And this is why actually

296
00:18:56,670 --> 00:18:59,710
schools are starting to put educate,
uh,

297
00:18:59,730 --> 00:19:01,830
hackerspaces as part of their curriculum.

298
00:19:02,220 --> 00:19:05,370
And schools and education
can look like this.

299
00:19:06,690 --> 00:19:11,690
And in fact they are now more and more
education is about learning a lifetime of

300
00:19:14,641 --> 00:19:19,380
learning. Cause we don't stop
learning once we get out of school.

301
00:19:19,740 --> 00:19:23,700
If we stop learning once we got out of
the school, we just are waiting to die.

302
00:19:24,330 --> 00:19:26,010
And there's nothing wrong
with waiting to die.

303
00:19:26,011 --> 00:19:28,440
But life can be way cooler than that.

304
00:19:29,250 --> 00:19:32,370
So it can be very fulfilling.

305
00:19:34,260 --> 00:19:37,800
And maybe some of you have noticed that
we live in a society with capitalism.

306
00:19:39,120 --> 00:19:40,830
Uh,
and with capitalism,

307
00:19:40,831 --> 00:19:45,570
we have the absurd situation where you
have to have numbers on a screen or

308
00:19:45,580 --> 00:19:48,870
fistful of dollars in order
to have food and shelter.

309
00:19:49,650 --> 00:19:54,390
That's kind of bizarre, but it's true.
This is the way our planet is right now.

310
00:19:54,540 --> 00:19:57,030
So in order to get this
money, what do you do? Well,

311
00:19:57,031 --> 00:20:01,260
most people get a job and to have a job,
you go to work.

312
00:20:02,100 --> 00:20:05,130
Some of you may have found a better
place than this, like I said,

313
00:20:05,310 --> 00:20:09,330
but a lot of us on our planet, according
to the Internet where all truthfully,

314
00:20:10,020 --> 00:20:14,940
80% of Americans don't like their work
and a good percentage of those hate their

315
00:20:14,941 --> 00:20:18,030
work.
But I love my job.

316
00:20:19,860 --> 00:20:22,770
I turn TVs off for living.

317
00:20:23,760 --> 00:20:26,910
I created this device called TVB gone,

318
00:20:26,911 --> 00:20:30,510
which is a key chain that turns
televisions off in public places.

319
00:20:31,980 --> 00:20:34,350
And for the last 14 years,

320
00:20:34,920 --> 00:20:39,210
I and 12 friends have
made a living on this. Um,

321
00:20:39,330 --> 00:20:40,290
and uh,

322
00:20:40,291 --> 00:20:44,580
I want to talk about a
bit about entrepreneurship
because this is another reason

323
00:20:44,581 --> 00:20:49,000
why hackerspaces had been focused
upon a lot, uh, in the last few years.

324
00:20:49,270 --> 00:20:51,340
And true partnership is not this.

325
00:20:51,670 --> 00:20:54,700
It's not if you're going to be
a good intrepreneur anyways.

326
00:20:54,701 --> 00:20:59,000
It's not about making money.
Most intrepreneur.

327
00:20:59,060 --> 00:21:00,970
Most people that call
themselves an entrepreneur,

328
00:21:00,971 --> 00:21:03,640
the first thing that I think
about is I'm going to make money.

329
00:21:04,120 --> 00:21:08,360
How am I gonna make money?
I'll start a startup.

330
00:21:08,690 --> 00:21:13,250
Yeah. What should the startup be? I
Dunno. A lot of people making apps.

331
00:21:13,251 --> 00:21:17,960
Maybe I'm like an APP. Mine will
be orange, whatever. That's stupid.

332
00:21:18,590 --> 00:21:23,060
Don't do that. Can do it if
you want to, but it's stupid.

333
00:21:23,061 --> 00:21:24,680
You don't want to be stupid.
Do something cool.

334
00:21:24,700 --> 00:21:28,550
Intrepreneurship can be and should be.
In my view,

335
00:21:28,760 --> 00:21:30,200
creating meaning.

336
00:21:30,530 --> 00:21:35,270
If you make time to explore and do
something you think is cool and you find

337
00:21:35,271 --> 00:21:38,480
something cool and it's meaningful to
you and you think other people might like

338
00:21:38,481 --> 00:21:39,860
it and they think it's meaningful,

339
00:21:39,861 --> 00:21:43,130
those are the kinds of things and
capitalism that people will pay you to do.

340
00:21:43,550 --> 00:21:45,410
And now you have a startup.
We're starting.

341
00:21:48,180 --> 00:21:52,020
So back to my personal stuff here,

342
00:21:52,050 --> 00:21:55,200
cause it's relevant again. You
know, I was, grew up depressed.

343
00:21:55,201 --> 00:22:00,120
I escaped him to television. I learned
to be Geeky. I became a consultant.

344
00:22:00,121 --> 00:22:03,900
I can make enough money in three months
to live the rest of the year without

345
00:22:03,901 --> 00:22:08,190
working and I could do all these
other things that I loved. Um,

346
00:22:08,550 --> 00:22:10,830
and it's all up for me
about doing things I love,

347
00:22:10,831 --> 00:22:14,490
but I wasn't finding things I loved at
work. I would have things that were cool.

348
00:22:14,670 --> 00:22:17,730
Like I was one of the people
who created virtual reality.

349
00:22:17,940 --> 00:22:22,480
I worked on voice recognition,
a lot of um, uh, uh,

350
00:22:22,530 --> 00:22:26,480
graphic stuff back when that was.
There were no graphics cards, uh,

351
00:22:26,520 --> 00:22:28,260
lots and lots of interesting things,

352
00:22:28,261 --> 00:22:30,930
but none of them made me jump
out of bed in the morning,

353
00:22:30,931 --> 00:22:34,170
excited to face the day and solve the
problems that needed to be solved.

354
00:22:34,440 --> 00:22:38,580
And it was just an okay way to make money.
Um,

355
00:22:38,610 --> 00:22:43,610
so I actually quit doing that in 2003
so that I could run an experiment on

356
00:22:47,041 --> 00:22:50,820
myself. I saved up enough money.
I was lucky enough to do that,

357
00:22:50,821 --> 00:22:55,821
to live a year without working for money
and I would only do what I loved in

358
00:22:57,001 --> 00:22:57,834
that here.

359
00:22:58,260 --> 00:23:02,850
What would life be like if the only thing
you did for that whole year was what

360
00:23:02,851 --> 00:23:06,930
you loved? Of course I still had
to do laundry for the most part.

361
00:23:06,931 --> 00:23:11,160
I was just going to do what I loved
and if we're came along that I loved,

362
00:23:11,161 --> 00:23:11,761
I would take it.

363
00:23:11,761 --> 00:23:15,480
But it was kind of scary because I didn't
know if I would get any more work if I

364
00:23:15,481 --> 00:23:18,690
kept telling people no, because I
didn't love what they were offering me.

365
00:23:19,260 --> 00:23:22,890
But I did it anyways.
And I started working on all the,

366
00:23:22,891 --> 00:23:24,780
I did volunteer work and
all these things I love,

367
00:23:24,781 --> 00:23:28,080
but I started working on projects that I
had been thinking about but didn't have

368
00:23:28,081 --> 00:23:31,670
time to work on because I'd
only been doing work, uh,

369
00:23:31,710 --> 00:23:34,170
electronic work on all these
things for other people.

370
00:23:34,170 --> 00:23:37,650
And I ran out of electronics
kind of energy. But, uh,

371
00:23:37,651 --> 00:23:42,651
this one project that a I worked on that
really got on a roll was a result of

372
00:23:44,580 --> 00:23:48,800
TV's popping up everywhere
in public places. Uh,

373
00:23:48,801 --> 00:23:50,570
I quit TV in 1980.

374
00:23:50,660 --> 00:23:55,660
My life suddenly had tons of time to
start facing the issues in my life.

375
00:23:56,130 --> 00:23:59,780
To start doing things I thought were
worthwhile to learn how to handle dealing

376
00:23:59,781 --> 00:24:04,250
with the weird, bizarre social
dynamics of human beings. And, um,

377
00:24:04,790 --> 00:24:08,720
and it turns out I actually like humans.
They're my favorite species now. But, um,

378
00:24:09,500 --> 00:24:14,180
uh, yeah. You know, whatever. Uh, I
had all this stuff going on in my life.

379
00:24:14,181 --> 00:24:19,181
And suddenly in 1993 TV started
popping up everywhere in public places.

380
00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:25,720
Some of you may not be old
enough to remember that
there was a time that TVs did

381
00:24:25,821 --> 00:24:29,570
not exist in public places.
They were only in living rooms,

382
00:24:29,571 --> 00:24:33,500
and they were expensive things,
and people saw a TV and a restaurant.

383
00:24:33,500 --> 00:24:37,040
They thought that was an indication
of it being a dive. He horrible place.

384
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:39,680
But it started happening. And, uh,

385
00:24:39,681 --> 00:24:43,130
it took me 10 years to get a place in
my life where I could start actually

386
00:24:43,131 --> 00:24:47,750
working on this project. So this was in
2003. I was like, now I have the time.

387
00:24:47,751 --> 00:24:49,970
I'm going to work on this project.
And I did.

388
00:24:50,240 --> 00:24:53,270
And I did it because I
totally love this project.

389
00:24:53,271 --> 00:24:58,271
It was meaningful for me because
this force that was totally,

390
00:24:58,820 --> 00:25:03,620
uh, taken over my life when I was a kid
was starting to come back and I wanted to

391
00:25:03,621 --> 00:25:06,740
get rid of it.
And so as a Geek I knew I could,

392
00:25:06,741 --> 00:25:11,150
it's just a remote control with a bunch
of off codes. All of them I could get.

393
00:25:11,360 --> 00:25:13,850
And it just plays one after
the other after the other.

394
00:25:13,851 --> 00:25:15,920
And if you press the button
and make that happen,

395
00:25:15,950 --> 00:25:19,790
eventually the TV in front of
you turns off. Totally simple.

396
00:25:20,390 --> 00:25:23,660
I figured it would take about three weeks.
It took me a year and a half.

397
00:25:24,350 --> 00:25:27,710
Projects always take longer than
you think they will should. Uh,

398
00:25:27,711 --> 00:25:32,060
but I was obsessed with this
project and I got all the off codes.

399
00:25:32,240 --> 00:25:35,210
I made them open source from,
no one ever has to do that ever again.

400
00:25:35,390 --> 00:25:38,480
They're all online for free,
grab them, turn TVs off.

401
00:25:38,481 --> 00:25:42,260
But I made TVB gone and um,
it was a work of love.

402
00:25:42,261 --> 00:25:45,780
Bunch of friends helped me. Um, and uh,

403
00:25:45,790 --> 00:25:49,760
I made one from my friends and we all
went all over San Francisco turning TV's

404
00:25:49,761 --> 00:25:52,820
off in public places and it was really,
really fun.

405
00:25:53,720 --> 00:25:56,840
And of course they told their friends and
many of their friends wanted it and it

406
00:25:56,841 --> 00:26:00,530
turned out many of the
friends of the friends wanted
them. That's when I thought,

407
00:26:00,830 --> 00:26:05,210
Gee, this thing that I just made one for
me and friends since they wanted them,

408
00:26:06,860 --> 00:26:08,240
other people want to maybe,

409
00:26:08,810 --> 00:26:13,300
maybe I could make a bunch because one
of the things I did as a consultant for

410
00:26:13,310 --> 00:26:16,460
small electronic companies was
manufacturer things for them.

411
00:26:16,470 --> 00:26:19,340
So I learned how to do that.
Maybe I could make some of these,

412
00:26:19,640 --> 00:26:24,320
so I made as many as I could afford,
which was 20,000. Kind of a gamble,

413
00:26:24,500 --> 00:26:26,660
but I did some math.
I figured if I did that,

414
00:26:26,661 --> 00:26:31,661
then I could break even if I sold 5,000
of those 20,000 and if I sold any more

415
00:26:31,731 --> 00:26:35,660
of those that would supplement my
income might take five or 10 years,

416
00:26:35,840 --> 00:26:37,520
but whatever,
that would be cool.

417
00:26:37,521 --> 00:26:41,030
There'd be five or 10,000 people going
all over the world. Turning TV's off,

418
00:26:41,031 --> 00:26:44,310
that'd be pretty cool.
So I did that.

419
00:26:44,311 --> 00:26:48,060
And then it turned out that I
was absolutely, totally wrong.

420
00:26:48,420 --> 00:26:50,940
I sold all 20,000 in three weeks.

421
00:26:52,980 --> 00:26:56,230
I was on National Public
Radio in New York Times, uh,

422
00:26:56,290 --> 00:27:00,950
on people magazine. And, uh,
you know, Fox News. I went, uh,

423
00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:05,700
I was brought in a limo from my apartment
in San Francisco to the Fox News,

424
00:27:05,730 --> 00:27:10,730
um, um, uh, studios in
Oakland. And they said, well,

425
00:27:10,731 --> 00:27:14,460
what your thing work online? 14 million
people watching. And the person asks me,

426
00:27:14,640 --> 00:27:17,880
well, it turn off these monitors here in
our studio. And I'm like, I don't know.

427
00:27:17,881 --> 00:27:18,900
Let's see.
And I do it.

428
00:27:18,901 --> 00:27:23,080
And I pushed the button and all of them
turn off and then the whole place like

429
00:27:23,280 --> 00:27:27,480
the gasps and then they
start laughing and um, yeah.

430
00:27:27,481 --> 00:27:28,470
And then afterwards,

431
00:27:28,500 --> 00:27:32,730
one of the people at a Fox where
it's kind of like looking around

432
00:27:33,110 --> 00:27:35,040
okay. And the kind of like, ah,

433
00:27:37,090 --> 00:27:41,890
I agree with you.
And the odd thing is 10 minutes later,

434
00:27:41,891 --> 00:27:44,980
another person that didn't know
that other one did the same thing.

435
00:27:44,981 --> 00:27:49,070
So how many people at Fox?
Or actually uh, yeah, phone.

436
00:27:49,270 --> 00:27:50,950
So anyways,

437
00:27:50,980 --> 00:27:55,980
that was 2004 when I put that
out and here I am 14 years later

438
00:28:00,010 --> 00:28:04,240
and um, that's the only way I've
made money in the last 14 years.

439
00:28:04,750 --> 00:28:09,750
Me and 12 friends for 14 years have made
a living on this project we think is

440
00:28:10,001 --> 00:28:11,830
really cool.
Really awesome.

441
00:28:12,130 --> 00:28:17,130
A project we love and that brings
me to my definition of success

442
00:28:21,240 --> 00:28:24,810
is that success?
No,

443
00:28:26,190 --> 00:28:27,330
it's a pile of money.

444
00:28:28,890 --> 00:28:32,520
Piling money is not success and
pilot money is just a pile of money.

445
00:28:33,480 --> 00:28:36,270
My definition of success is this.

446
00:28:36,690 --> 00:28:40,290
If your explore and do what you love
and you find something you love and it's

447
00:28:40,291 --> 00:28:43,650
meaningful and you put it out there in
whatever way and other people think it's

448
00:28:43,651 --> 00:28:46,440
meaningful and they're paying you to do
it, you get enough of whatever you need,

449
00:28:46,441 --> 00:28:50,250
including money to keep doing what
you love. What more do you need?

450
00:28:51,910 --> 00:28:52,750
What more do you need?

451
00:28:53,830 --> 00:28:57,340
If you spend even two seconds
more making money beyond that,

452
00:28:57,341 --> 00:29:00,280
you are wasting your time.
Why are you doing that?

453
00:29:04,310 --> 00:29:05,143
So

454
00:29:06,510 --> 00:29:10,760
community is what makes all
of this really possible.

455
00:29:10,820 --> 00:29:14,360
I wouldn't have been able to
do TV gone just on my own. Um,

456
00:29:14,510 --> 00:29:17,720
maybe it would have taken way, way,
way longer. But I did it way, way,

457
00:29:17,721 --> 00:29:21,030
way better because I had a community
of friends with hackerspaces.

458
00:29:21,070 --> 00:29:24,260
Now we don't have to be lucky enough
to have the friends with all these

459
00:29:24,261 --> 00:29:25,190
different skills.

460
00:29:25,340 --> 00:29:28,050
People with those skills are in
our community at our hackerspaces.

461
00:29:28,490 --> 00:29:31,820
We can do lots together and we
need to have people together.

462
00:29:31,821 --> 00:29:34,730
We can do it so much better together.
But often we needed, you know,

463
00:29:34,731 --> 00:29:39,180
like Linux wouldn't have
happened no matter how
brilliant Linnaeus was, his, um,

464
00:29:39,310 --> 00:29:42,670
and three printers was an international
project and all these things,

465
00:29:42,671 --> 00:29:47,671
we do so much better when we put
people together and inspire each other.

466
00:29:49,270 --> 00:29:51,100
And this is what maker fairs were about.

467
00:29:51,101 --> 00:29:56,080
And the first one in 2006 people who
found community with the projects they do

468
00:29:56,081 --> 00:29:57,160
and showing them off.

469
00:29:57,340 --> 00:30:01,840
But this is what's been going on with
hacker conferences for decades now.

470
00:30:02,380 --> 00:30:06,880
And my first hacker conference
I was invited to because
a of TVB gone and it was

471
00:30:06,881 --> 00:30:10,720
amazing. Thousands of people, almost
all of whom do what they love,

472
00:30:10,721 --> 00:30:13,390
which makes it super high way,

473
00:30:13,391 --> 00:30:18,130
unfortunately different than
society at large. And I loved that.

474
00:30:18,131 --> 00:30:20,290
And when the conference was over,
I wanted more,

475
00:30:20,860 --> 00:30:23,920
but I had to wait until my next
conference and it was high again.

476
00:30:23,921 --> 00:30:25,870
And that was the one in Germany.
And um,

477
00:30:25,990 --> 00:30:29,440
and I've been going to these and I've
been helping organize this one ever since

478
00:30:29,441 --> 00:30:33,580
hope hackers on planet earth. Um, and um,

479
00:30:34,420 --> 00:30:38,560
uh, by my third one, it was
just the coolest thing. I mean,

480
00:30:38,561 --> 00:30:43,150
they had a fan of spaceship and I taught
people to solder and they of course had

481
00:30:43,151 --> 00:30:44,440
lasers and hundreds of talks,

482
00:30:44,441 --> 00:30:47,230
one of which was how to
start your own hacker space.

483
00:30:47,350 --> 00:30:51,580
And that inspired me and several of my
friends from various parts of the US to

484
00:30:51,581 --> 00:30:53,380
start hackerspaces and
we all helped each other.

485
00:30:53,381 --> 00:30:56,770
And we got help from the Germans who
had been looking around and seeing what

486
00:30:56,771 --> 00:30:59,980
works and what doesn't
work at hackerspaces there
for the last many years.

487
00:31:00,340 --> 00:31:02,620
And we started the early hacker spaces.

488
00:31:02,621 --> 00:31:07,570
Some of the early hackerspaces is in
the u s a Noisebridge in San Francisco.

489
00:31:07,840 --> 00:31:10,720
This was in 2007 hack DC in Washington,

490
00:31:10,721 --> 00:31:14,470
DC and NYC resistor in New York City.
Um,

491
00:31:14,500 --> 00:31:16,210
and when we did that in 2007,

492
00:31:16,211 --> 00:31:21,010
there were about 40 hackerspaces
and now there's thousands.

493
00:31:21,400 --> 00:31:22,990
And this is actually an old picture.

494
00:31:23,170 --> 00:31:27,250
China is now just as obliterated with
pins for hackerspaces as the rest of the

495
00:31:27,251 --> 00:31:30,700
world. And this is from
hackerspaces.org, uh,

496
00:31:30,750 --> 00:31:34,930
are organizing websites that we created
to help people start hackerspaces.

497
00:31:35,080 --> 00:31:37,900
And the thing is,
hackerspace is still all help each other.

498
00:31:39,520 --> 00:31:40,990
If anyone wants to start one,

499
00:31:41,110 --> 00:31:44,890
there's always people to help
and we all help each other.

500
00:31:44,980 --> 00:31:49,240
Each one's unique though.
There's no central Church of hackerspaces.

501
00:31:49,450 --> 00:31:53,110
Each one can organize themselves any
way they want and help each other.

502
00:31:53,650 --> 00:31:58,030
And there's lots of them all over the
world. There's noise. Bridge is Tokyo.

503
00:31:58,270 --> 00:32:02,050
Here's a few in Belgium and these are all
ones where I've been. And last year, um,

504
00:32:02,080 --> 00:32:06,100
just random ones, I've been to hundreds
and hundreds is more in Belgium.

505
00:32:06,580 --> 00:32:11,560
I'm more in Belgium. That's in
Brazil. Sao Paolo. Uh, London,

506
00:32:11,940 --> 00:32:15,790
uh, Zagreb, Croatia, where I was
a hacker in residence this year.

507
00:32:15,820 --> 00:32:18,670
Tommy one in Tel Aviv or I
was a hacker in residence.

508
00:32:19,080 --> 00:32:21,010
These are all me giving workshops,
soldering,

509
00:32:21,011 --> 00:32:24,040
but of course things go on besides
just soldering. That's just pictures.

510
00:32:24,041 --> 00:32:28,600
I've got a Urbana Illinois where I was
a hacker in residence, a Shinto, Jen,

511
00:32:28,601 --> 00:32:32,560
a hackerspace, the coolest one in China,
the first one in China, two in Shanghai.

512
00:32:32,770 --> 00:32:36,730
But there are lots of cool places
in China once for just little kids.

513
00:32:36,731 --> 00:32:39,710
This is university Ching Hua University.
Uh,

514
00:32:40,670 --> 00:32:42,650
Shen Jen do DIY.

515
00:32:42,820 --> 00:32:47,780
They have things for little kids and
all people of all ages. A Chihuahua, uh,

516
00:32:47,840 --> 00:32:51,230
is a way cool place in Shenzhen as well.
And um,

517
00:32:51,830 --> 00:32:56,830
the head of state of China visited them
in 2015 while all of Chinese media with

518
00:32:59,900 --> 00:33:01,850
hundreds of millions of people watching,

519
00:33:01,851 --> 00:33:04,920
visited this space and said
that this hackerspace is,

520
00:33:04,940 --> 00:33:07,220
are the future of China for education,

521
00:33:07,221 --> 00:33:11,480
for economic development and personal
growth. And I'm not to be outdone,

522
00:33:12,420 --> 00:33:15,860
uh, our president at the
time did that too. Um,

523
00:33:16,160 --> 00:33:19,970
although not hundreds of millions of
people watching. Um, but after this,

524
00:33:20,420 --> 00:33:25,420
all bureaucrats all over the world
knew that they must start hackerspaces.

525
00:33:26,030 --> 00:33:26,721
Unfortunately,

526
00:33:26,721 --> 00:33:29,660
they don't know what they are and
they make places that look like this,

527
00:33:32,180 --> 00:33:33,440
which is kind of a waste.

528
00:33:33,441 --> 00:33:37,760
But those could get filled up
with people doing cool things. Um,

529
00:33:37,970 --> 00:33:40,820
if there's a community
that can make that happen.

530
00:33:41,510 --> 00:33:44,420
I don't want to say that
community is hard work.

531
00:33:45,950 --> 00:33:50,300
We're not good at this stuff, but
we got to get better at it. Uh,

532
00:33:50,540 --> 00:33:55,010
if we want to have communities that
are worth having. And um, yeah.

533
00:33:55,160 --> 00:33:59,990
Um, I'm actually no longer part of noise
bridge because of some of the serious

534
00:34:00,380 --> 00:34:04,550
problems there. And I thought
I could have, uh, you know,

535
00:34:04,551 --> 00:34:08,750
use my energies for something
more positive for me. Um, yeah.

536
00:34:08,751 --> 00:34:12,170
And that saddens me. But,
um, I do wish everyone,

537
00:34:12,680 --> 00:34:16,790
they're the best,
but community is very rewarding.

538
00:34:17,750 --> 00:34:18,980
It's very rewarding.

539
00:34:19,760 --> 00:34:23,810
And it's what's been driving me is
helping communities around the world.

540
00:34:24,140 --> 00:34:25,230
And that's what I do.

541
00:34:25,231 --> 00:34:30,231
And one of the things I do is I travel
all over the planet and I want to hammer

542
00:34:30,261 --> 00:34:33,770
this in for anyone watching.
So you do this,

543
00:34:35,110 --> 00:34:38,780
you out there, listen to
this. Okay, great. Okay,

544
00:34:38,781 --> 00:34:43,781
so entrepreneurship doesn't have
to be about just making money.

545
00:34:44,900 --> 00:34:47,000
You need to make enough
money to make it all work.

546
00:34:47,001 --> 00:34:48,740
Of course we have a capitalist society,

547
00:34:48,741 --> 00:34:53,240
but entrepreneurship for it to work
has to happen this way in this order.

548
00:34:53,390 --> 00:34:57,860
First you make time and then you explore
and you find things that you think are

549
00:34:57,861 --> 00:35:01,790
cool. You keep trying things, you try it
out. Some things work, some things don't.

550
00:35:01,791 --> 00:35:03,920
You keep learning from successes,
from failures.

551
00:35:03,921 --> 00:35:08,630
You'll learn way more from
failures because we fail a
lot more than we succeed.

552
00:35:08,631 --> 00:35:12,230
But we learned from all of this and
you keep trying again and again.

553
00:35:12,380 --> 00:35:16,400
It's a roller coaster. There's ups,
there's downs, it's okay, you keep going.

554
00:35:16,401 --> 00:35:18,260
You're driven by it because it's awesome,

555
00:35:18,261 --> 00:35:22,070
it's cool and eventually
you find something you love
that's meaningful for you.

556
00:35:22,071 --> 00:35:23,360
It's meaningful for others.

557
00:35:23,510 --> 00:35:28,310
Now you have something that's worth
starting because people will pay you for

558
00:35:28,311 --> 00:35:31,940
something they find meaningful and
now you have a startup that has some

559
00:35:31,941 --> 00:35:34,400
possibility for success.

560
00:35:35,690 --> 00:35:39,900
Unfortunately on our planet right now
and here in Ground Zero San Francisco,

561
00:35:40,170 --> 00:35:45,170
it's mostly driven by investors who
don't care about anything except making

562
00:35:46,111 --> 00:35:48,570
money for themselves.
No matter what they say.

563
00:35:48,571 --> 00:35:50,490
And they believe the
lies as they say them.

564
00:35:50,491 --> 00:35:54,720
So if you have an FVC of
vulture capitalist, sorry,

565
00:35:54,750 --> 00:35:59,190
venture capitalist, um,
don't believe their shit.

566
00:36:00,180 --> 00:36:02,010
They believe it,
but you don't have to,

567
00:36:02,340 --> 00:36:07,230
they want you to have an exit strategy
before you even start and they want you

568
00:36:07,231 --> 00:36:09,900
to become the next apple
and the next Google.

569
00:36:11,220 --> 00:36:13,710
There already is an apple and a Google.

570
00:36:13,711 --> 00:36:16,170
I don't think the world needs another one.

571
00:36:16,830 --> 00:36:20,220
Some people might argue that we
already have one to many of edge.

572
00:36:20,940 --> 00:36:23,970
I'm not saying where I
stand there, but um, uh,

573
00:36:24,030 --> 00:36:28,200
I'm very happy to be here at
one of these corporations, uh,

574
00:36:28,260 --> 00:36:30,630
who is doing at least some
good things in the world.

575
00:36:31,140 --> 00:36:34,320
We also don't need to grow.

576
00:36:35,370 --> 00:36:38,370
Growing is not always good,

577
00:36:40,100 --> 00:36:40,933
okay?

578
00:36:40,970 --> 00:36:41,960
We don't have to grow.

579
00:36:41,961 --> 00:36:46,040
We just have to have a sustainable
business so that the people who are in it

580
00:36:46,041 --> 00:36:49,190
find what they do meaningful and
by doing what they find meaningful,

581
00:36:49,191 --> 00:36:51,200
get enough of what they
need to keep doing it.

582
00:36:52,820 --> 00:36:57,020
What would your life be
like if you were doing that?

583
00:36:57,050 --> 00:36:58,460
Maybe you aren't doing that here.

584
00:36:59,390 --> 00:37:03,320
What would the world be like if there
were hundreds of millions of these kind of

585
00:37:03,321 --> 00:37:07,220
small sustainable businesses,
most of which don't grow,

586
00:37:07,250 --> 00:37:11,180
some of which become popular and they
need to and they want to make whatever

587
00:37:11,181 --> 00:37:14,570
they have available to warn more
people and so they can grow in.

588
00:37:14,571 --> 00:37:16,940
Some investors might even
make money from it, fine,

589
00:37:17,840 --> 00:37:21,740
but what would the world be like if there
were hundreds of millions of these and

590
00:37:21,741 --> 00:37:24,950
it wasn't 80% of people
who didn't like their jobs,

591
00:37:24,951 --> 00:37:29,840
but 80% of people who did and what if a
huge percentage of those loved what they

592
00:37:29,841 --> 00:37:33,440
were doing in the world with a
third of their life going to work?

593
00:37:34,310 --> 00:37:38,870
I think the world would be a way
more amazing place than it is now.

594
00:37:40,950 --> 00:37:44,610
Hackerspaces are one way to do this
because there are places where people come

595
00:37:44,611 --> 00:37:47,970
together and are supported by their
community to explore and do these kinds of

596
00:37:47,971 --> 00:37:49,170
amazing things.

597
00:37:49,800 --> 00:37:54,330
We need these not just hackerspaces
about community and all sorts of ways.

598
00:37:54,331 --> 00:37:58,470
And I encourage you all to do that because
if we wait for our governments to do

599
00:37:58,471 --> 00:38:03,000
that, we are all going to be
dead. But while we're alive,

600
00:38:03,001 --> 00:38:07,290
we have the opportunity to do cool things
for ourselves and the people around us.

601
00:38:07,860 --> 00:38:11,010
So I encourage you all tend to that.

602
00:38:11,460 --> 00:38:14,220
And if I can help in any way,
let me know.

603
00:38:16,560 --> 00:38:17,393
Thanks.

604
00:38:27,610 --> 00:38:31,440
Yeah.
Um,

605
00:38:31,540 --> 00:38:35,290
we have one question. Um, the dory from

606
00:38:36,070 --> 00:38:39,160
New York, from Leo. Hi Mitch.

607
00:38:39,220 --> 00:38:43,870
I remember reading about your brain
machine device back in make magazine at

608
00:38:43,871 --> 00:38:47,020
least 10 years ago now
that some time has passed.

609
00:38:47,021 --> 00:38:51,310
What updates would you make
for 2018 and beyond, if any?

610
00:38:52,250 --> 00:38:55,800
Well, a lot of things I've been
playing with uh, brainwaves, um,

611
00:38:56,240 --> 00:38:58,850
stuff all my life as an Undergrad,
I,

612
00:38:58,970 --> 00:39:03,050
I was a Guinea pig for
a psych experiments, uh,

613
00:39:03,140 --> 00:39:07,070
physiological psych experiments. Uh,
back then you had to have things,

614
00:39:07,120 --> 00:39:11,000
Gulu deer skull and uh,
uh, but it was cool.

615
00:39:11,001 --> 00:39:13,460
You could read your brain waves.
Um,

616
00:39:13,730 --> 00:39:18,380
and people have been recording
brainwaves since 1928. Uh, and, uh,

617
00:39:18,410 --> 00:39:21,200
the brain machine came just
to sort of this flash rains,

618
00:39:21,250 --> 00:39:24,950
great inspiration when
I was meditating ones.

619
00:39:25,280 --> 00:39:28,010
And I thought what would happen
if you played brainwaves back?

620
00:39:28,580 --> 00:39:31,310
And it turns out when I
started researching that
the people have been playing

621
00:39:31,311 --> 00:39:35,330
them back ever since they started
recording them in 1928. Um,

622
00:39:35,331 --> 00:39:40,331
so I made brain machine has a simple
thing to encourage people to try to make

623
00:39:40,341 --> 00:39:44,420
something if they've never made anything
before. And it was super popular. Uh,

624
00:39:44,421 --> 00:39:48,620
what made it super popular is that it
blinks lights. Um, the way it works,

625
00:39:48,621 --> 00:39:51,590
it blinks lights and make sound
at a sequence of meditation,

626
00:39:51,591 --> 00:39:56,210
brainwave sequence frequencies.
And if it works for you,

627
00:39:56,211 --> 00:39:58,940
your brain just sort of syncs up to
it and you follow along and then you

628
00:39:58,941 --> 00:40:00,630
meditate.
Um,

629
00:40:00,800 --> 00:40:04,190
but what makes it super popular is that
your brain doesn't know what to do with,

630
00:40:04,250 --> 00:40:08,420
uh, the blinky light information that
feels fills your whole field of vision.

631
00:40:08,990 --> 00:40:13,430
Um, and so since it doesn't understand
what to do, it make stuff up.

632
00:40:14,120 --> 00:40:16,970
That's what our brains do when
something doesn't make sense,

633
00:40:17,150 --> 00:40:21,980
which explains a lot of
our politics. Um, but uh,

634
00:40:21,981 --> 00:40:24,800
what you make up when you're
doing the brain machine is, uh,

635
00:40:24,801 --> 00:40:29,120
you draw from your imagination and your
experience and you see beautiful wild

636
00:40:29,121 --> 00:40:30,170
colors and patterns.

637
00:40:30,740 --> 00:40:34,360
And it turns out a lot of people
actually like hallucinating. So, uh,

638
00:40:34,400 --> 00:40:37,880
it's been a popular project for a long
time and I'm not the only one who makes

639
00:40:37,881 --> 00:40:42,590
things like this. I just made one that
was really cheap and easy to make. So, um,

640
00:40:42,860 --> 00:40:47,810
what I've been wanting to do and have
been playing with is having input as well

641
00:40:47,811 --> 00:40:50,960
as output.
So if you have EEG,

642
00:40:50,961 --> 00:40:54,770
that's the way to measure brainwaves.
Uh, there's cheap ones now.

643
00:40:55,070 --> 00:40:58,460
There's open source ones. A friend of
mine is working on one called brain,

644
00:40:58,550 --> 00:41:03,320
we know works on an Arduino. Um,
it's $250. And it works great.

645
00:41:03,321 --> 00:41:04,580
So if I have that,

646
00:41:04,910 --> 00:41:09,680
then it can be reading my brainwaves as
of the blinking lights on the sound are

647
00:41:09,681 --> 00:41:11,750
trying to get me to the state that I want.

648
00:41:12,050 --> 00:41:16,310
It can be seeing if it's working and it
can alter it and then get me to where I

649
00:41:16,311 --> 00:41:20,960
want to be rather quickly. Um, yeah. So
that's, that's what I've been working on.

650
00:41:20,961 --> 00:41:24,170
And then there's this other thing here.
Um,

651
00:41:25,430 --> 00:41:29,660
I had a Kickstarter for this a long
time ago and it's gets kind of weird,

652
00:41:29,661 --> 00:41:30,860
but it's like a brain machine,

653
00:41:30,861 --> 00:41:35,060
but it's way nicer
sound and a more gentle,

654
00:41:35,061 --> 00:41:35,930
you don't hallucinate,

655
00:41:35,931 --> 00:41:39,830
but it has a 20 minute sequence to bring
you to the point of falling asleep to

656
00:41:39,831 --> 00:41:44,540
help people sleep. So, uh, yeah, I put
a lot of time and energy into that. Um,

657
00:41:44,840 --> 00:41:47,600
the Kickstarter was successful,
but since then, marketing,

658
00:41:47,601 --> 00:41:52,070
this has just been really difficult.
So this hasn't really gone to many places,

659
00:41:52,071 --> 00:41:54,500
but I'd love to add, um, uh,

660
00:41:54,650 --> 00:41:57,410
EEG to that and play around with that.

661
00:42:07,260 --> 00:42:07,710
Right.

662
00:42:07,710 --> 00:42:08,511
Hi there.
Okay.

663
00:42:08,511 --> 00:42:13,370
Good question for you about makerspaces
and other communities like that. Um,

664
00:42:13,490 --> 00:42:17,200
can you comment a little bit about
best practices to make them work? Um,

665
00:42:17,630 --> 00:42:20,510
I noticed you highlighted Noisebridge
where there were some difficulties,

666
00:42:20,511 --> 00:42:21,980
but what,
what are,

667
00:42:22,250 --> 00:42:25,940
what does successful makerspaces do
to make the community grow and thrive?

668
00:42:27,110 --> 00:42:30,490
Uh, that's a big question. Um,
and it's unique to each space,

669
00:42:30,491 --> 00:42:32,220
but there's a few things that are,
um,

670
00:42:32,680 --> 00:42:36,910
probably common for all the
ones that are working. Uh,

671
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:41,250
of course you need to have a business
model so that you get more, uh,

672
00:42:41,440 --> 00:42:46,360
resources in. Then you use a, and that
definitely includes money on our planet,

673
00:42:46,361 --> 00:42:49,960
but they're all at a hacker spaces that
are, uh, there were more in the past,

674
00:42:49,961 --> 00:42:52,390
but that our squats and they need very,
very little money.

675
00:42:52,600 --> 00:42:56,020
But you need a bunch of, um, uh,

676
00:42:56,110 --> 00:43:00,010
you need a space otherwise
not a hacker space. Um,

677
00:43:00,250 --> 00:43:01,720
and um,
yeah,

678
00:43:01,721 --> 00:43:04,930
so there has to be some kind of model
for bringing more resources and then you

679
00:43:04,931 --> 00:43:05,680
spend,

680
00:43:05,680 --> 00:43:10,680
you also have to have a way to organize
yourselves so that everyone who's part

681
00:43:11,891 --> 00:43:15,820
of the organization feels like this
is a great way to organize ourselves.

682
00:43:16,060 --> 00:43:21,060
A way of having decision making that
everyone involved feels heard and um,

683
00:43:21,760 --> 00:43:22,690
feels valuable.

684
00:43:23,350 --> 00:43:27,690
You have to have ways of having conflict
resolution because when you have more

685
00:43:27,691 --> 00:43:32,140
of one or more humans in room,
there will be strife. Um,

686
00:43:32,590 --> 00:43:33,430
and uh,

687
00:43:33,431 --> 00:43:38,080
we need to have ways that are worthwhile
to resolve the conflicts when people

688
00:43:38,081 --> 00:43:41,650
have conflict and it's always going
to happen. Uh, if you resolve them,

689
00:43:41,651 --> 00:43:45,880
that brings people closer.
If people don't,

690
00:43:45,910 --> 00:43:48,640
there's like just a little thing,
I'm going to ignore it.

691
00:43:48,690 --> 00:43:50,500
Then it builds up and
people have resentments.

692
00:43:50,501 --> 00:43:55,420
We've all had this with boyfriends,
girlfriends or whatever. Um, and um,

693
00:43:56,050 --> 00:43:58,990
yeah. Uh, it builds and resentments build.

694
00:43:58,991 --> 00:44:02,860
We have to have ways to encourage people
to bring things up while they're little.

695
00:44:03,730 --> 00:44:06,890
That's not easy. We're all
trained, especially, uh,

696
00:44:07,030 --> 00:44:11,560
in our modern America to not say things
we know people don't want to hear,

697
00:44:12,100 --> 00:44:14,830
but it's super important.
We need to learn to do these things.

698
00:44:15,180 --> 00:44:20,180
Otherwise people just end up drifting
away rather than staying in a place that

699
00:44:22,060 --> 00:44:25,690
it's challenging. Um,
also, this is a hard part.

700
00:44:25,720 --> 00:44:27,670
It's not the fun part
of having any community.

701
00:44:27,671 --> 00:44:32,070
You need to kick out people who aren't
working, you give him plenty of chances,

702
00:44:32,700 --> 00:44:36,210
you know, you don't want to just
go, oh, you cross the unwritten law,

703
00:44:36,300 --> 00:44:39,270
now you're out of it. Sorry. Um,

704
00:44:39,490 --> 00:44:44,040
give people a chance to change their
behaviors and do it in a way that people

705
00:44:44,041 --> 00:44:48,240
feel good. You've got a, I'm
doing in a way that's uh,

706
00:44:48,241 --> 00:44:53,241
and Noisebridge we have only one rule
and that's be excellent to each other.

707
00:44:54,450 --> 00:44:58,350
Um, yeah. If someone's
not being excellent,

708
00:44:58,380 --> 00:45:02,700
it's not okay to be mean to them.
That's not excellent.

709
00:45:03,300 --> 00:45:07,320
So if someone's not doing things in
a way that fit in with the community,

710
00:45:07,321 --> 00:45:11,580
give them plenty of chances and learn
from them as well because that can be

711
00:45:11,581 --> 00:45:14,250
pointing out something that's not
working well in your community.

712
00:45:14,790 --> 00:45:18,770
But we really nice to them and
polite, assertive, of course. Um,

713
00:45:18,810 --> 00:45:23,370
and resolve the issues. Again,
that's a broad generalization, but,

714
00:45:23,520 --> 00:45:26,700
and it's not easy. It's easy
to say. It's super difficult.

715
00:45:26,701 --> 00:45:29,670
That's one of the most difficult
parts of being in any community or any

716
00:45:29,671 --> 00:45:34,530
relationship, but it's
way worthwhile. So, um,

717
00:45:35,140 --> 00:45:39,240
yeah, those are some of the things you
have to have activities that people in the

718
00:45:39,300 --> 00:45:43,890
community wants to do.
And you have to encourage people.

719
00:45:43,891 --> 00:45:46,760
Everyone has to encourage each other to,
uh,

720
00:45:47,100 --> 00:45:51,750
put a little bit more past their comfort
zone into activities so that people

721
00:45:51,751 --> 00:45:54,570
have an exciting environment come in.

722
00:45:54,900 --> 00:45:59,730
The ideal if the hacker spaces a place
where people can just pop in any time and

723
00:45:59,731 --> 00:46:04,590
something cool will be happening.
And then more and more people come more,

724
00:46:04,620 --> 00:46:07,740
which makes more and more cool people
come and more people are doing more cool

725
00:46:07,741 --> 00:46:10,770
things, which make more people come
because there's cool things happening,

726
00:46:11,230 --> 00:46:12,840
et cetera.
So.

727
00:46:15,070 --> 00:46:15,903
Okay.

728
00:46:16,330 --> 00:46:18,380
That was all kind of vague.
I know.

729
00:46:18,381 --> 00:46:21,530
But if you have any specifics
I can address those.

730
00:46:27,040 --> 00:46:27,873
Um,

731
00:46:28,070 --> 00:46:32,160
so I'm interested to hear your thoughts
on how we can improve diversity in our

732
00:46:32,161 --> 00:46:33,810
hackerspaces.
Uh,

733
00:46:33,930 --> 00:46:38,930
they do tend to be very white and a lot
of white privilege people are the people

734
00:46:38,941 --> 00:46:43,830
who are participating in them. Not 100%,
but, uh, you know, I'm interested to,

735
00:46:44,180 --> 00:46:47,880
you know, how can we change that and
how can we make it more, you know,

736
00:46:48,030 --> 00:46:51,090
diverse from a neurodiverse race,

737
00:46:51,091 --> 00:46:55,380
gender thought problem,
religion, politics, whatever.

738
00:46:56,080 --> 00:47:00,760
Yeah. Um, not all hackerspaces
feel that's super important.

739
00:47:00,790 --> 00:47:04,360
Uh, I knew, um, and at noise
bridge at the very beginning,

740
00:47:04,361 --> 00:47:06,790
we wanted it to be as, uh, you know,

741
00:47:06,791 --> 00:47:10,920
ideally to reflect the
demographics of San Francisco. Uh,

742
00:47:10,930 --> 00:47:12,040
that hasn't happened.

743
00:47:12,250 --> 00:47:16,240
People who are white and
middle or upper class,

744
00:47:16,241 --> 00:47:20,590
certainly I've more
opportunities and advantages
and privileges and other people.

745
00:47:20,800 --> 00:47:21,770
So,
um,

746
00:47:21,820 --> 00:47:26,420
people in that class have
more time and also have, um,

747
00:47:26,620 --> 00:47:31,350
the ability to take for doing
something like this. Um,

748
00:47:31,540 --> 00:47:35,590
but given that, um, myself
included in that class, um,

749
00:47:35,620 --> 00:47:38,830
have this opportunity and the privilege,

750
00:47:38,831 --> 00:47:41,860
we can share that with others
and encourage others to join us.

751
00:47:42,220 --> 00:47:45,400
So at the beginning of noise
bridge, um, it was, um,

752
00:47:45,430 --> 00:47:50,430
probably about 40% female and 6%
male and a handful of other genders.

753
00:47:52,210 --> 00:47:53,410
And,
um,

754
00:47:54,010 --> 00:47:59,010
we wanted to encourage people to join us
in order to ensure that there was more

755
00:48:01,900 --> 00:48:04,960
gender balance. We started
doing things from the beginning,

756
00:48:05,320 --> 00:48:09,130
getting the tools together so that there
were like traditional whatever to call

757
00:48:09,131 --> 00:48:13,900
it, things that are roles for
females like sewing and craft.

758
00:48:14,270 --> 00:48:17,500
Um, and what we found
is really quickly, uh,

759
00:48:17,501 --> 00:48:19,920
since sewing stuff's over here
in soldering, is over here,

760
00:48:19,940 --> 00:48:22,930
electronics and there's other
things in fabrication all around.

761
00:48:23,080 --> 00:48:24,430
It's just one big open space.

762
00:48:25,150 --> 00:48:30,150
Everyone just starts in your mixing
and there's no solid separation anyways

763
00:48:30,491 --> 00:48:35,491
between electronics and art
and electronics and sewing
or sewing and fabrication

764
00:48:37,691 --> 00:48:42,580
of other things. So, uh, and there's
certainly no wall that prevents,

765
00:48:42,610 --> 00:48:46,240
uh, someone of one gender going
here or another gender going there.

766
00:48:46,241 --> 00:48:50,500
And there's nothing about a human brain
regardless of gender that says whether

767
00:48:50,501 --> 00:48:54,700
you can or cannot hold a soldering iron
or can or cannot put fabric through a

768
00:48:54,701 --> 00:48:56,100
sewing machine.
Um,

769
00:48:56,280 --> 00:49:01,280
so doing these things that have been
traditionally for one gender and making

770
00:49:01,301 --> 00:49:02,380
sure that they're there,

771
00:49:02,381 --> 00:49:06,940
especially for the genders that you
would normally be underrepresented, uh,

772
00:49:06,941 --> 00:49:10,870
has been really good way at hackerspaces
around the world to get more diversity

773
00:49:11,650 --> 00:49:12,790
in a positive way.

774
00:49:13,120 --> 00:49:17,980
And not just saying having a quota
because that doesn't seem to work.

775
00:49:18,310 --> 00:49:23,230
Um, and uh, at, um,
artisan's asylum in Boston,

776
00:49:23,231 --> 00:49:28,231
there was a woman who was super great at
a welding and she started a class that

777
00:49:29,081 --> 00:49:33,460
was really popular for awhile. Maybe
it still is a called welding for girls.

778
00:49:34,270 --> 00:49:38,230
And uh, that was a way to get a whole
bunch of women in who might not have come

779
00:49:38,231 --> 00:49:40,030
otherwise.
Uh,

780
00:49:40,060 --> 00:49:44,800
San Francisco is a pretty diverse
set of different peoples. Uh,

781
00:49:44,830 --> 00:49:49,750
noise bridge is in the mission,
which is a, was until recently,

782
00:49:49,751 --> 00:49:54,040
mostly Hispanic. And yet there aren't
many Hispanic people at noise bridge.

783
00:49:54,520 --> 00:49:59,260
And we've been rather unsuccessful
at getting a Hispanic people in,

784
00:50:00,070 --> 00:50:04,990
which it's unfortunate there's
been a number, but um, you know,

785
00:50:05,940 --> 00:50:10,480
cause we want it to be welcoming for
everybody. So, but we keep trying,

786
00:50:10,690 --> 00:50:11,320
you know,

787
00:50:11,320 --> 00:50:16,320
we have the broader problem of our planet,

788
00:50:16,601 --> 00:50:20,260
the way it is and the way it
has been for thousands of years.

789
00:50:20,261 --> 00:50:24,130
So we're not going to solve all the
problems right away with just one

790
00:50:24,131 --> 00:50:27,380
organization. But we can try things,
see what works and what doesn't.

791
00:50:27,381 --> 00:50:28,191
Share it with others,

792
00:50:28,191 --> 00:50:31,490
learning from others of what works and
doesn't work from them and keep trying to

793
00:50:31,491 --> 00:50:34,760
make it better. And as long as we
keep doing that, it does get better.

794
00:50:38,360 --> 00:50:40,930
Yeah.
I think we're out of time,

795
00:50:40,931 --> 00:50:45,370
but if you have more time or
have decided to quit your job,

796
00:50:45,650 --> 00:50:48,980
do what you love all day. Um, we,

797
00:50:48,990 --> 00:50:51,350
last night we just decided to have this,
uh,

798
00:50:51,440 --> 00:50:56,440
ad hoc up kind of hacker space setting
and we have luck picking sets to play

799
00:50:57,041 --> 00:51:02,041
with and we have matches kits to play
with and we have San Francisco maker space

800
00:51:05,651 --> 00:51:09,020
represented to play with. So, uh,

801
00:51:09,460 --> 00:51:14,460
stay and play and we can have a
little San Francisco community.

802
00:51:15,130 --> 00:51:19,750
Is it okay if I take a picture of the
audience? Anyone care? Okay, cool.

803
00:51:20,710 --> 00:51:21,543
Hi Roland.

804
00:51:22,880 --> 00:51:23,713
Yeah.

805
00:51:24,100 --> 00:51:26,380
Cool.
Thanks.
