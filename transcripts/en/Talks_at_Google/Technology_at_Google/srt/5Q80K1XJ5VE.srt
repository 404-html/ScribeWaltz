and philanthropist Mr. Crack mark re new

11
00:00:46,021 --> 00:00:46,590
mark,

12
00:00:46,590 --> 00:00:51,590
founder of craigslist and crowd Craig
Newmark Foundation crack is born in 1952

13
00:00:53,311 --> 00:00:58,311
in New Jersey and moved to San Francisco
around 1990 around 1995 he started a

14
00:00:59,371 --> 00:01:04,371
mailing list which ultimately turned into
craiglist.org one of the world's most

15
00:01:05,221 --> 00:01:09,390
successful online classified
advertisement websites. Nowadays,

16
00:01:09,391 --> 00:01:14,391
he focused more on philanthropy efforts
with a crack and new mark foundation and

17
00:01:14,491 --> 00:01:19,491
hasn't been involved in management
since 2000 while he caught himself still

18
00:01:20,641 --> 00:01:24,680
doing some lightweight customer service.
Please welcome Craig

19
00:01:30,910 --> 00:01:35,890
folks. Thanks. And I really
do wear Kangle hats like this,

20
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:40,200
but it's too warm in here now.
Yeah.

21
00:01:40,510 --> 00:01:45,400
What I'd like to do is speak a
bit about a founding craigslist.

22
00:01:45,880 --> 00:01:48,250
Why I did it,
I'll talk a little bit,

23
00:01:48,251 --> 00:01:52,210
but what about the technology than
I normally do, a given the audience,

24
00:01:53,050 --> 00:01:57,700
I'm going to talk about the philanthropic
philosophy I developed without

25
00:01:57,701 --> 00:02:00,940
consciously thinking about
it along those lines.

26
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:04,900
And I'm going to talk about the
philanthropy I've engaged with right now,

27
00:02:05,320 --> 00:02:10,090
including connections to
Wikipedia and also to, uh,

28
00:02:10,360 --> 00:02:15,360
something called Google news because
I'm actually highly involved with that.

29
00:02:16,270 --> 00:02:17,740
In fact,
I'll just begin by saying,

30
00:02:17,741 --> 00:02:21,910
so I don't forget that a Google
news folks are doing really good,

31
00:02:21,911 --> 00:02:23,260
really important work,

32
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:28,480
particularly involving the countering
of disinformation that includes,

33
00:02:28,870 --> 00:02:33,160
uh, trying to get the names right.
Richard Gingras, Steve Grove,

34
00:02:33,660 --> 00:02:38,620
a Erica Anderson and Olivia Ma.
I'm probably missing some names,

35
00:02:38,621 --> 00:02:42,190
but those are the ones that
come to mind immediately.

36
00:02:42,700 --> 00:02:46,210
So I may repeat a little bit
more about that. But, uh,

37
00:02:46,270 --> 00:02:51,270
something I mentioned the head too
is I spent 17 years at IBM and I saw

38
00:02:52,721 --> 00:02:54,460
frequently,
especially in the field,

39
00:02:54,880 --> 00:02:57,970
people were not given
credit for stuff they did.

40
00:02:58,210 --> 00:03:00,850
So I overdo it.

41
00:03:01,390 --> 00:03:04,780
I spent a couple of years of Charles
Schwab for that matter going around the

42
00:03:04,781 --> 00:03:08,560
company at lunch, things telling people
that the Internet would be a thing.

43
00:03:08,561 --> 00:03:13,330
Sunday, this was 94 mostly.
And the guy who started the,

44
00:03:13,331 --> 00:03:15,760
uh,
web at a Charles Schwab,

45
00:03:15,761 --> 00:03:20,761
a guy named Doris Milosky has been a
forgotten except that I keep bringing his

46
00:03:20,921 --> 00:03:24,170
name up at things like this.
Um,

47
00:03:24,340 --> 00:03:28,300
keep track of time for me cause I
don't want to go crazy with it. Uh,

48
00:03:28,630 --> 00:03:33,610
my ideal is that I am a
nerd of the old school, uh,

49
00:03:34,090 --> 00:03:38,320
born in, you know, the early fifties,
grew up through the fifties and sixties.

50
00:03:38,740 --> 00:03:42,700
There's a stereotype about a guy who
wears a plastic pocket protector,

51
00:03:43,210 --> 00:03:46,810
thick black glasses,
taped together and no social skills.

52
00:03:47,650 --> 00:03:49,960
That was me in completely,

53
00:03:49,961 --> 00:03:52,780
literally in high school two times.

54
00:03:53,140 --> 00:03:58,140
I really had my thick black glass is
broken and I tried taping them together

55
00:03:58,510 --> 00:04:00,070
until I got replacements.

56
00:04:00,520 --> 00:04:05,520
No social skills and even now what you
see before you is a simulation of social

57
00:04:05,981 --> 00:04:06,814
skills.

58
00:04:07,540 --> 00:04:12,540
And I can do that for about 90 minutes
after which things start going south and

59
00:04:13,921 --> 00:04:18,310
I become, I become a cranky. Um,

60
00:04:18,640 --> 00:04:19,810
my ideal,
you know,

61
00:04:19,811 --> 00:04:24,580
is that I got a couple of
degrees in computer sciences
at Case Western case tech

62
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,380
in the mid Seventies.

63
00:04:26,620 --> 00:04:31,620
Although I've learned coding in high
school in 1969 using punch cards for Tran

64
00:04:33,841 --> 00:04:36,490
too,
and an IBM 1620.

65
00:04:38,050 --> 00:04:43,050
I feel like I should make it your homework
assignment to look up a all three,

66
00:04:43,780 --> 00:04:45,760
but you'll be frightened.
However,

67
00:04:45,761 --> 00:04:49,990
I can assure you that the 1620 was
from that generation of computers,

68
00:04:50,200 --> 00:04:55,200
which had the blinky lights and they
literally did have the blinky lights and I

69
00:04:55,661 --> 00:05:00,610
kind of miss that. Not that I'm going
to be searching a surplus for, uh,

70
00:05:00,850 --> 00:05:03,640
for one of those,
it was about the size of a player piano.

71
00:05:05,590 --> 00:05:09,460
Anyway, you know, after some
point I decide to leave IBM,

72
00:05:09,850 --> 00:05:13,990
I get myself hired by Charles Schwab
who brings me to San Francisco,

73
00:05:14,200 --> 00:05:19,200
which I appreciate and I got a lot of
help from people around town on the net

74
00:05:19,630 --> 00:05:20,070
using it.

75
00:05:20,070 --> 00:05:25,070
Newsgroups well helping me with
a neighborhoods around town,

76
00:05:25,660 --> 00:05:29,650
helping me with uh, you know,
restaurants and how to get around.

77
00:05:29,651 --> 00:05:32,260
And this was pretty good,
you know,

78
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:35,980
so early 95 rolls around and I'm
leaving Charles Schwab at the time,

79
00:05:36,250 --> 00:05:37,750
but I'm thinking I should give back.

80
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:43,330
So I started as simple mailing list and
basically what it is is I'm using a very

81
00:05:43,331 --> 00:05:46,540
advanced email tool back in
[inaudible] 95 called pine.

82
00:05:48,100 --> 00:05:51,610
And you know,
I figure it's just a CC list,

83
00:05:51,820 --> 00:05:56,410
10 12 people to start with events
that involve arts and our technology.

84
00:05:56,900 --> 00:05:59,150
And then I, uh, you know,

85
00:05:59,151 --> 00:06:02,270
just the people tell me about
more stuff and I do more stuff.

86
00:06:02,630 --> 00:06:06,560
People started asking me to do different
things and I go along with that.

87
00:06:07,310 --> 00:06:10,280
But about the middle of a 95,

88
00:06:10,940 --> 00:06:15,940
the CC list stuff at about
250 addresses breaks.

89
00:06:16,640 --> 00:06:20,270
And I need to use a list server,
somebody volunteers, major Domo,

90
00:06:20,750 --> 00:06:23,090
and as an old school,
neuro dime, very literal.

91
00:06:23,810 --> 00:06:26,120
So I'll call it San Francisco events.

92
00:06:27,230 --> 00:06:29,210
People around me that are smarter than me,

93
00:06:29,810 --> 00:06:32,480
they say we already call it craigslist,

94
00:06:32,990 --> 00:06:36,590
keep calling it that it signifies
it will be personal in the quirky.

95
00:06:37,790 --> 00:06:42,770
And then they explained to me
what a brand is. A seriously,

96
00:06:42,771 --> 00:06:47,330
I didn't know those of you,
uh, in marketing. We should
have cause to mark me.

97
00:06:48,110 --> 00:06:49,790
But anyway,
I learned a what it is,

98
00:06:49,791 --> 00:06:53,210
I was 42 at the time and uh,

99
00:06:53,690 --> 00:06:58,090
that made a lot of sense to
me. So it's craigslist, um,

100
00:06:58,220 --> 00:07:02,050
just kept plugging away for a
few years all by myself. Uh,

101
00:07:02,110 --> 00:07:07,110
one interesting thing in
97 was that people at job
posters ask me to charge them

102
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:11,580
for their ads. Why? Um,

103
00:07:11,870 --> 00:07:16,040
they thought they were getting
better results in the list. Um,

104
00:07:16,490 --> 00:07:20,750
but a better results than paying expensive
headhunters or whatever for it to

105
00:07:20,751 --> 00:07:21,680
help them get people.

106
00:07:22,670 --> 00:07:27,670
So I figured I w a philosophy
might be to charge people for ads,

107
00:07:27,891 --> 00:07:29,690
people who already paid for ads,

108
00:07:29,810 --> 00:07:34,340
but to charge them a much less
money for more effective ads.

109
00:07:34,610 --> 00:07:39,440
And that's a practice we continue to
this day. The side is almost all free,

110
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:44,680
but we do charge for ads specifically
at times to minimize abuse.

111
00:07:46,070 --> 00:07:49,310
Like in New York apartment
brokers in Manhattan,

112
00:07:49,460 --> 00:07:51,650
the New York apartment brokers can really,
uh,

113
00:07:51,740 --> 00:07:54,800
damaged people like at
the very last minute,

114
00:07:54,801 --> 00:07:59,510
they'll tell you if there's
a big commission on an
apartment and that's not okay.

115
00:07:59,960 --> 00:08:02,660
And speaking to them,
we made a little dent in the problem,

116
00:08:03,020 --> 00:08:07,100
but I'm getting way ahead of
myself. And in 97 also, uh,

117
00:08:07,700 --> 00:08:12,440
at that point we were hitting or I was
hitting about a million page views per

118
00:08:12,441 --> 00:08:13,274
month,

119
00:08:13,610 --> 00:08:18,050
which at the end of 97 for a one
person operation pretty good.

120
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:20,100
And,
uh,

121
00:08:20,100 --> 00:08:25,100
also Microsoft sidewalk and obsolete
city site wanted to run banner ads,

122
00:08:25,790 --> 00:08:29,070
but I disliked banner ads.
I,

123
00:08:29,510 --> 00:08:34,490
many of them I think are just kind
of stupid. So I just decided that,

124
00:08:34,491 --> 00:08:38,270
uh, you know, I'm living
comfortably enough.

125
00:08:38,510 --> 00:08:42,700
I don't need the extra
income that grew into a,

126
00:08:42,960 --> 00:08:46,340
the lesson that, uh, but
I was calling nerd values.

127
00:08:46,670 --> 00:08:50,750
If you make enough money to live
comfortably and then to help your family,

128
00:08:50,751 --> 00:08:52,520
maybe some friends live comfortably,

129
00:08:53,300 --> 00:08:55,950
then it's more satisfying
to change the world.

130
00:08:56,970 --> 00:09:01,410
And that's our philosophy
to date. But are I, uh,

131
00:09:01,530 --> 00:09:05,760
people are also suggesting that I
ran the site on a volunteer basis.

132
00:09:06,330 --> 00:09:09,480
That's what happened in 98.
Uh,

133
00:09:09,820 --> 00:09:12,360
[inaudible] even back then,
things were easy.

134
00:09:12,750 --> 00:09:16,410
I recently saw a credit card bill
from back then and I was running and

135
00:09:16,420 --> 00:09:20,910
craigslist on something
called best Internet services,

136
00:09:21,150 --> 00:09:25,470
which is all gone now. But I
was running the site, the name,

137
00:09:25,970 --> 00:09:29,950
well sorry, best internist. Yeah,

138
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:34,080
they got bought by someone who was
bought by someone else. And uh,

139
00:09:34,110 --> 00:09:39,110
but I was paying 35 bucks a month for
hosting services back then and it,

140
00:09:40,680 --> 00:09:44,150
cause sometime in that timeframe,
well before I get,

141
00:09:44,340 --> 00:09:48,570
before I used the services of
volunteers, I was thinking, well,

142
00:09:48,780 --> 00:09:52,440
I'm using pine. I one point realized, oh,

143
00:09:52,441 --> 00:09:57,090
pine can output and email into a,

144
00:09:57,091 --> 00:10:01,080
a perl script.
Pearl was hot then.

145
00:10:02,370 --> 00:10:05,460
And, uh, I figured, well,

146
00:10:05,610 --> 00:10:09,540
I can write some simple code
which extracts the email
headers because they were

147
00:10:09,541 --> 00:10:13,170
pretty predictable and I
would have instant html pages,

148
00:10:13,500 --> 00:10:17,970
therefore instant publishing.
And that's how our site was born.

149
00:10:18,270 --> 00:10:20,130
I think that was late 96,

150
00:10:20,340 --> 00:10:24,630
but I don't remember because this was
all a hobby and I wasn't taking notes.

151
00:10:26,520 --> 00:10:29,760
So on 98 rolls around,
I try writing things from a,

152
00:10:29,761 --> 00:10:33,780
with volunteers and there
to say a lot in a few words,

153
00:10:34,380 --> 00:10:37,440
people, some of the job
posters who wanted to pay me,

154
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:42,120
who started off that like a year before
they approached me and said things were

155
00:10:42,121 --> 00:10:47,010
not working and they said if I
wanted to craigslist and survive,

156
00:10:47,490 --> 00:10:52,350
I had to go full time, make it
into a real company. And uh,

157
00:10:52,530 --> 00:10:54,460
they were right.
Um,

158
00:10:55,050 --> 00:10:59,430
99 I had to make tough decisions
like how much to monetize.

159
00:11:00,390 --> 00:11:04,380
And again, I was thinking, you
know, that nerd values thing.

160
00:11:04,620 --> 00:11:06,720
And I was thinking even
from Sunday school,

161
00:11:07,080 --> 00:11:10,260
Mr and Mrs [inaudible] taught me,
you know,

162
00:11:10,261 --> 00:11:13,920
to think how much is enough.
And in my case,

163
00:11:14,670 --> 00:11:18,660
not too much is enough.
I do indulge myself in some ways.

164
00:11:18,870 --> 00:11:23,730
I buy all the books I want
and things like that. But,

165
00:11:23,731 --> 00:11:24,660
uh,
you know,

166
00:11:24,661 --> 00:11:29,661
I don't go crazy with things and I just
gave up my old Prius 15 years old to a

167
00:11:30,271 --> 00:11:34,770
brother in law who has three,
uh, kids who are driving now.

168
00:11:36,290 --> 00:11:36,810
You know,

169
00:11:36,810 --> 00:11:41,670
I have a feeling I may wind up regretting
my decision and I have my eye on the

170
00:11:41,670 --> 00:11:45,660
Chevy Bolt, which is a good electric car
and it has a lot of electronics on it,

171
00:11:45,930 --> 00:11:49,200
which I could fool around with
and possibly injure myself.

172
00:11:50,490 --> 00:11:55,270
So they are, I am, you know,
uh, these guys say I should,
uh, start a new, you know,

173
00:11:55,450 --> 00:11:59,500
start my own company and by then
even add lots of parties and stuff.

174
00:11:59,770 --> 00:12:03,150
I talked to a bankers and, uh, you know,

175
00:12:03,160 --> 00:12:07,420
vcs in this area and they are
telling me, hey, I should, uh,

176
00:12:07,630 --> 00:12:12,610
monetize the usual silicon valley way
and there will be putting billions of

177
00:12:12,610 --> 00:12:16,390
dollars on the table.
The answer again is how much do you need?

178
00:12:17,290 --> 00:12:19,720
Like, now that I've done
a lot with philanthropy,

179
00:12:19,990 --> 00:12:24,490
I can see having a some billions
to give away. It'd be pretty cool.

180
00:12:25,570 --> 00:12:30,570
But I also think about the philanthropic
model of the robber barons who would

181
00:12:31,781 --> 00:12:34,150
acquire the equivalent of billions.

182
00:12:34,540 --> 00:12:39,540
They would acquire it by abusing their
employees and their customers and then

183
00:12:39,761 --> 00:12:43,390
they would give back a little bit of it,
you know,

184
00:12:43,450 --> 00:12:47,800
decades after the fact.
So instead, I'm thinking,

185
00:12:48,070 --> 00:12:52,000
but craigslist is about,
is helping people put food on the table.

186
00:12:52,840 --> 00:12:56,270
It's helping people find a
table under which to put on the,

187
00:12:56,271 --> 00:12:57,670
on which to put the food.

188
00:12:58,120 --> 00:13:03,120
And then Craig's list is about finding
a roof under which to put the table with

189
00:13:03,251 --> 00:13:04,084
the food.

190
00:13:04,900 --> 00:13:09,490
And so there's this a philanthropic
model I've accidentally come up with,

191
00:13:09,491 --> 00:13:13,240
which is let someone trying
to put food on the table,

192
00:13:13,450 --> 00:13:16,390
keep the money they would
otherwise spend on advertising.

193
00:13:17,500 --> 00:13:20,230
And that's a much more cost efficient,

194
00:13:20,930 --> 00:13:25,930
a model for philanthropy and
so said and fewest words.

195
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:28,870
The business model is
doing well by doing good.

196
00:13:30,070 --> 00:13:33,070
And that worked out pretty well.
Uh,

197
00:13:33,071 --> 00:13:37,300
I tried running the company myself for
about a year and then some of the same

198
00:13:37,301 --> 00:13:42,301
people approached me and help me
understand that as a manager I suck.

199
00:13:44,110 --> 00:13:44,830
Um,

200
00:13:44,830 --> 00:13:49,660
I'm emotionally unsuited
to the hardest of,

201
00:13:49,860 --> 00:13:54,250
uh, management activities
like hiring and firing people.

202
00:13:54,430 --> 00:13:59,170
I'm just not tough. Hired a Jim
[inaudible], Jim Buckmaster to do the job.

203
00:13:59,670 --> 00:14:02,410
Uh, that's worked. And, uh,

204
00:14:02,770 --> 00:14:06,910
I figured around then I
stopped programming because,

205
00:14:07,930 --> 00:14:12,190
you know, at 10 point around then we
had hired a whole cadre of programmers,

206
00:14:12,460 --> 00:14:14,440
all of whom smarter than me,

207
00:14:15,400 --> 00:14:20,400
but I saw a need for myself to go full
time in customer service because another

208
00:14:20,441 --> 00:14:23,950
Sunday school lesson was treated.
People like you wanted to be treated.

209
00:14:24,910 --> 00:14:29,910
And in business that means have serious
customer service and you do the best you

210
00:14:31,061 --> 00:14:35,080
can. It's challenging when
your site is mostly free.

211
00:14:36,040 --> 00:14:39,580
And that's probably an unsolvable
problem in some regards.

212
00:14:40,360 --> 00:14:43,810
But that's what we, uh,
that's what we were trying.

213
00:14:45,160 --> 00:14:46,050
And uh,

214
00:14:46,610 --> 00:14:51,610
it turns it over to Jim did customer
service for a long time thing is in

215
00:14:51,951 --> 00:14:55,910
customer service online.
You may have heard that, uh,

216
00:14:56,570 --> 00:15:01,270
you see some things that you
can never unsee. You know,

217
00:15:01,271 --> 00:15:05,210
I have seen a certain amount of
ugliness I've seen far more good,

218
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:07,040
but the ugliness can get to you.

219
00:15:07,550 --> 00:15:12,550
And that's a big problem right now in
user generated content and in commenting

220
00:15:12,741 --> 00:15:13,574
systems,

221
00:15:13,910 --> 00:15:18,910
there is a great need for keyword or
keyword filtering kind of systems.

222
00:15:19,790 --> 00:15:24,790
That is actually this word filtering
systems that can figure out bad stuff,

223
00:15:25,880 --> 00:15:26,713
um,

224
00:15:26,810 --> 00:15:31,810
in ways that doesn't rely on actually
seeing specific keywords or doing basian

225
00:15:31,850 --> 00:15:34,820
filtering.
What's needed is software,

226
00:15:34,821 --> 00:15:38,960
which I don't think exists because I
don't think AI juristics we'll solve that

227
00:15:38,961 --> 00:15:43,250
problem. Um, if anyone knows him or
anything like that, I'd like to know.

228
00:15:43,730 --> 00:15:47,660
But, uh, um, I have a feeling
the only thing I could do,

229
00:15:47,661 --> 00:15:51,920
the full customer service job
would be actual strong AI.

230
00:15:52,580 --> 00:15:56,660
And I for one, welcome our
machine overlords. Frankly,

231
00:15:56,990 --> 00:16:01,430
I'm beginning to feel like it's time for
machine overlords. And when I say that,

232
00:16:01,850 --> 00:16:04,610
I'm not sure if I'm joking anymore.

233
00:16:05,990 --> 00:16:07,610
So that was a,
you know,

234
00:16:07,760 --> 00:16:12,440
2000 and since then
Craig's list just grows.

235
00:16:12,740 --> 00:16:17,240
We're now in a whole bunch of more
cities, a whole bunch more countries. Uh,

236
00:16:17,241 --> 00:16:21,410
the direction I, uh, put it in
generally remains unchanged.

237
00:16:22,040 --> 00:16:27,020
Uh, folks may hear, may have noticed
that we have changed the user experience,

238
00:16:27,380 --> 00:16:32,380
but stay consistent with design principles
which say keep it simple and keep it

239
00:16:33,051 --> 00:16:37,310
fast. Listen to what are the
real needs and wants of people,

240
00:16:37,550 --> 00:16:39,080
not the fancy stuff.

241
00:16:39,620 --> 00:16:42,710
So you'll see that in
our tables of contents,

242
00:16:42,860 --> 00:16:44,660
which are used to be things you scanned.

243
00:16:44,910 --> 00:16:49,610
There is fairly sophisticated
database powering there. And uh,

244
00:16:50,030 --> 00:16:51,860
there's uh,
you know,

245
00:16:51,890 --> 00:16:55,760
you'll be able to see thumbnails of the
pictures which are in the things you'll

246
00:16:55,761 --> 00:16:57,980
be able to see. The whole picture is, uh,

247
00:16:57,981 --> 00:17:00,260
you'll be able to see maps
and all the variants of that.

248
00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:05,300
Is he the last programming
thing that I did? 99 or 2000?

249
00:17:05,480 --> 00:17:09,650
I don't remember when was, well back
then I remember I was using pine,

250
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:11,960
the Dataset,

251
00:17:11,990 --> 00:17:16,990
the database for craigslist
back then was time,

252
00:17:17,180 --> 00:17:21,080
email folders. So, and pine is great.

253
00:17:21,350 --> 00:17:25,790
Pine forgive me in many respects,
as much easier to use in Gmail.

254
00:17:26,780 --> 00:17:29,420
This is actually a,
forgive me for bringing up the name.

255
00:17:29,780 --> 00:17:34,520
I had an extensive discussion on this
with Marissa Meyer about 10 years ago,

256
00:17:35,030 --> 00:17:39,750
which is why there are some shortcuts
in Gmail. But the deal is that, uh,

257
00:17:39,980 --> 00:17:44,980
I was able to with a few commands to
identify and remove all the old ads in a

258
00:17:46,821 --> 00:17:48,440
category with pine.

259
00:17:49,590 --> 00:17:54,590
And when pine email folders started
proving to be a unsatisfactory,

260
00:17:55,650 --> 00:18:00,180
I switched to my SQL and
that's when I stopped coding.

261
00:18:01,530 --> 00:18:04,860
Now and for the last several
years, I do some, uh,

262
00:18:05,100 --> 00:18:09,270
what I call lightweight or token customer
service to stay in touch with what's

263
00:18:09,271 --> 00:18:14,070
real because you want to find out
what's going on with everything,

264
00:18:14,340 --> 00:18:17,160
what do people care about,
what matters to people.

265
00:18:17,370 --> 00:18:19,620
And so I get to do that.

266
00:18:19,710 --> 00:18:24,600
Sometimes I handle a customer service
email directly and also very frequently

267
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:29,340
people will find me and social media
and, uh, come up with requests,

268
00:18:29,610 --> 00:18:33,210
which I'm embarrassed to say
I can't really help with. Um,

269
00:18:33,300 --> 00:18:36,930
so what I do with those is
I generally, uh, just uh,

270
00:18:36,990 --> 00:18:40,140
share them with a main
line customer service.

271
00:18:40,560 --> 00:18:45,560
And I have to phrase it carefully because
the Yahoo versus Barnes case makes it

272
00:18:45,811 --> 00:18:50,550
very clear that you can't imply you're
going to solve a problem and you know,

273
00:18:50,850 --> 00:18:52,800
not, you know, and if you,

274
00:18:52,801 --> 00:18:55,560
if it slips between the cracks
or you just forget or whatever,

275
00:18:55,770 --> 00:18:59,910
you have a problem.
So that's craigslist.

276
00:18:59,911 --> 00:19:02,730
They're doing well by doing good.
And again,

277
00:19:02,731 --> 00:19:07,530
I made that decision to
monetize minimally in a 99,

278
00:19:07,531 --> 00:19:10,800
2000,
not altruistically,

279
00:19:11,520 --> 00:19:15,510
but it's just what feels right.
Speaking as a nerd,

280
00:19:15,720 --> 00:19:19,830
as a person who is genuinely
dysfunctional in these regards,

281
00:19:20,540 --> 00:19:23,100
uh,
that's what happens sometimes.

282
00:19:24,330 --> 00:19:27,630
But in the last 10 plus years,

283
00:19:27,960 --> 00:19:29,490
over those years,

284
00:19:29,610 --> 00:19:34,320
people from nonprofit organizations
were coming to me talking about how to,

285
00:19:34,321 --> 00:19:37,800
uh, how to build community,
how to run sites,

286
00:19:38,100 --> 00:19:42,960
which might be the craigslist for
something. And frankly too, they,

287
00:19:43,140 --> 00:19:46,320
at times they were hoping for
a cash contributions and so on.

288
00:19:47,370 --> 00:19:49,860
And I started getting
organized regarding that.

289
00:19:49,861 --> 00:19:52,860
In 2011 it was something
called Craig connects.

290
00:19:53,850 --> 00:19:57,330
And as branding that kind of sucks
and it just didn't work very well.

291
00:19:58,500 --> 00:20:02,520
I'm pretty, uh, I'm more organized now
and I have this thing, Craig Newmark,

292
00:20:02,521 --> 00:20:06,990
philanthropy's dot org which
consist of Craig Newmark foundation,

293
00:20:07,290 --> 00:20:12,290
which is a five o one c three and I
have a couple of donor advised funds.

294
00:20:13,260 --> 00:20:18,060
There's also the craigslist charitable
fund. The idea is that I figure,

295
00:20:18,490 --> 00:20:23,340
um, I could see what's going on in the
world today and I can identify some areas

296
00:20:23,910 --> 00:20:28,800
where help is needed and uh,
you know,

297
00:20:28,801 --> 00:20:30,450
where I can help other people,

298
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:34,320
I can find smart people who are doing
things that make a difference and support

299
00:20:34,321 --> 00:20:39,210
them with media, with
cash, with convening power.

300
00:20:40,170 --> 00:20:40,620
Uh,

301
00:20:40,620 --> 00:20:45,620
the deal is that I screwed up really
badly with craigslist in the sense that I

302
00:20:45,811 --> 00:20:46,644
haven't,

303
00:20:47,110 --> 00:20:51,970
I never told people back in 2000 and
not now that I'm not in craigslist

304
00:20:51,971 --> 00:20:56,800
management and I've had real no real
role to play in any decision making since

305
00:20:56,801 --> 00:20:59,260
2000 stupid of me.

306
00:20:59,860 --> 00:21:04,300
And I learned how stupid that
was around 2010. So since then,

307
00:21:04,540 --> 00:21:08,320
I've now gotten communications
and PR religion.

308
00:21:08,470 --> 00:21:13,300
I'm a zealot that matters for technical
people because every one of us,

309
00:21:13,301 --> 00:21:17,020
how about us? Our own image, our
own brand, our own narrative.

310
00:21:17,350 --> 00:21:22,350
And no one is going to really
watch out for your own narrative.

311
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:26,650
That's something as tech people
we're all responsible for.

312
00:21:27,790 --> 00:21:30,820
But I figured that out in 2010 God,

313
00:21:30,821 --> 00:21:35,620
professional help and the right now I
need a great deal of professional help and

314
00:21:35,621 --> 00:21:40,180
I have it. I got an email from some of
the folks right before coming up here,

315
00:21:40,390 --> 00:21:45,250
literally. So that's a big,
big lesson. But in a way,

316
00:21:45,251 --> 00:21:47,860
with the help of
professional communicators,

317
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:51,010
I've identified four areas
where I'm helping people.

318
00:21:51,640 --> 00:21:56,640
There's a veterans and their families
because I figure if someone's willing to

319
00:21:57,400 --> 00:22:01,090
maybe go to another country and
risk taking ability protecting me,

320
00:22:01,240 --> 00:22:02,140
I should do something.

321
00:22:03,310 --> 00:22:07,660
And it never occurred to me until I was
told that their families give up and

322
00:22:07,661 --> 00:22:11,020
sacrifice a lot for them.
So for example,

323
00:22:11,050 --> 00:22:13,900
I started off today working with
the Bob Woodruff Foundation.

324
00:22:14,590 --> 00:22:19,590
They find they qualify and vet and fund
organizations which support wounded

325
00:22:20,960 --> 00:22:24,820
veterans, wounded veterans and
their families and their caregivers.

326
00:22:25,630 --> 00:22:27,040
So this is a really good setup.

327
00:22:27,070 --> 00:22:30,780
We got going and literally that was nine
o'clock this morning that I met with

328
00:22:30,781 --> 00:22:32,620
him.
Um,

329
00:22:32,740 --> 00:22:37,740
another area in the interest of practicing
what you preach and treating people

330
00:22:37,841 --> 00:22:40,750
like you want to be treated.
I have a women in tech effort,

331
00:22:41,230 --> 00:22:43,630
which I'm still developing.
Uh,

332
00:22:43,631 --> 00:22:46,930
I've been involved for years with
the women's startup challenge,

333
00:22:47,320 --> 00:22:49,930
which is a deal where,
um,

334
00:22:50,230 --> 00:22:55,230
startups run by women pitch to a panel
of vcs winning valuable cash prizes and

335
00:22:58,570 --> 00:23:03,570
winning valuable time with vcs cause
still usually hang around and help you

336
00:23:04,571 --> 00:23:09,050
network and give you advice.
So that's a big deal, um,

337
00:23:09,400 --> 00:23:13,900
in this year or two. But if you
want to protect the country, um,

338
00:23:14,260 --> 00:23:15,310
voting rights,

339
00:23:15,790 --> 00:23:19,390
the voting rights of lots of people
in this country are under attack.

340
00:23:19,900 --> 00:23:23,680
We knew they were under attack by bad
politicians for some years because

341
00:23:23,681 --> 00:23:27,820
sometimes the politicians will
admit it sometimes in a row,

342
00:23:28,870 --> 00:23:33,870
a week or so ago in a document
produced by Robert Muller in part 47,

343
00:23:36,580 --> 00:23:41,580
he says that one thing the Russians
were doing was interfering with,

344
00:23:41,651 --> 00:23:43,870
uh,
people actually voting.

345
00:23:44,320 --> 00:23:48,320
They were going after people who might
vote democratic and that may have tilted

346
00:23:48,321 --> 00:23:53,150
things in some states. Notice I'm not
making a political statement there.

347
00:23:53,450 --> 00:23:55,700
I'm talking about protecting the country,

348
00:23:57,050 --> 00:24:02,050
so the deal is that I'm doing what I can
to protect voting rights that's still

349
00:24:02,481 --> 00:24:05,540
developing because I'm only now
talking to the people doing it.

350
00:24:06,860 --> 00:24:11,860
Most of all though I have
a program involved with
trustworthy journalism and I'm

351
00:24:12,741 --> 00:24:16,070
supporting a number of groups
that are trying to do good work.

352
00:24:16,490 --> 00:24:21,320
Like I'm working with the
Google newspeople to support
the trust project out of

353
00:24:21,321 --> 00:24:25,070
Santa Clara University.
Speaking as a news consumer,

354
00:24:25,340 --> 00:24:30,340
I just want news I can trust the trust
project is one way of articulating what a

355
00:24:30,951 --> 00:24:34,310
news outlet has to do to
provide trustworthy news.

356
00:24:34,700 --> 00:24:36,710
Things like don't lie to people.

357
00:24:37,430 --> 00:24:40,820
Things like when you do make a mistake,
fix it.

358
00:24:41,270 --> 00:24:44,900
Things like listen to different
kinds of people so you get different

359
00:24:44,901 --> 00:24:45,800
perspectives.

360
00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:50,870
There's other things involved to Poynter
institute runs the international fact

361
00:24:50,871 --> 00:24:54,800
checking network because of a news
outlet commits to trustworthy journalism.

362
00:24:55,280 --> 00:24:58,580
They should, you know, you need watchdogs
to make sure that they're doing it.

363
00:24:59,900 --> 00:25:01,910
But as of a year ago,

364
00:25:02,210 --> 00:25:06,830
one guy who actually has been here and
who talks with the Google newspaper a lot,

365
00:25:07,070 --> 00:25:12,070
and also Facebook guy named Jeff Jarvis
a year ago told me for fun to read the

366
00:25:12,481 --> 00:25:17,481
NATO handbook on Russian information
warfare in that Russian military and

367
00:25:19,131 --> 00:25:22,160
military intelligence particular tell us,

368
00:25:22,400 --> 00:25:26,510
tell the world what they're gonna
do to the u s during the election.

369
00:25:27,920 --> 00:25:29,300
Uh,
and uh,

370
00:25:29,510 --> 00:25:34,510
last week I think Canadian
intelligence among others says,

371
00:25:34,700 --> 00:25:35,001
hey,

372
00:25:35,001 --> 00:25:40,001
here's what the Russians did in 2016
and continue to do now get growing up in

373
00:25:41,151 --> 00:25:45,800
the 50s, I saw a lot of crackpot activity
regarding communists and Russians.

374
00:25:46,580 --> 00:25:50,810
And so I'm a very gun shy in this regards,
but,

375
00:25:51,590 --> 00:25:56,210
um, the intelligence
community and, uh, you know,

376
00:25:56,211 --> 00:25:58,020
the people investigating fake news,

377
00:25:58,021 --> 00:26:01,550
the people who are looking at
networks of it say a lot of,

378
00:26:01,590 --> 00:26:06,590
there's a lot of domestic bad actors
amplifying what the Russians are doing for

379
00:26:06,680 --> 00:26:10,850
really bad results, including a lot
of harassment. This is real stuff.

380
00:26:11,270 --> 00:26:14,990
And I figure if I want to
help defend the country,

381
00:26:15,290 --> 00:26:18,290
I need to find people,
do find people doing good work.

382
00:26:18,710 --> 00:26:23,000
I need to get them communication
support and I need to fund them.

383
00:26:24,080 --> 00:26:25,730
And honestly,

384
00:26:25,731 --> 00:26:30,610
I'm now writing large checks to
support these groups because, uh,

385
00:26:30,860 --> 00:26:35,860
they are defending the country just like
active service members and veterans and

386
00:26:37,131 --> 00:26:40,940
their families help defend the country.
Similarly,

387
00:26:41,150 --> 00:26:46,150
I think Wikipedia plays a big role in
this because my slogan about Wikipedia is

388
00:26:46,501 --> 00:26:49,200
that Wikipedia is where facts go to live.

389
00:26:50,070 --> 00:26:54,060
So I'm involved in helping fund
their counter arrestment effort.

390
00:26:54,680 --> 00:26:58,710
I'm talking to them about, uh, what's
the nature of reliable sources.

391
00:26:59,610 --> 00:27:00,271
And,
uh,

392
00:27:00,271 --> 00:27:05,271
I'm also working with him on the bio's
of living persons because it's just

393
00:27:05,401 --> 00:27:09,780
really hard to get those bios fixed.
I had a college professor,

394
00:27:10,140 --> 00:27:12,060
uh,
fixed mine up for the most part,

395
00:27:12,480 --> 00:27:17,480
but I've been into some events recently
where when I talk about Wikipedia,

396
00:27:17,880 --> 00:27:21,930
frankly I get a lot of crap from
notable people who have Vyos,

397
00:27:22,110 --> 00:27:26,550
who have no way of fixing them.
So those are the kinds of things.

398
00:27:26,551 --> 00:27:29,070
I'm a working with Wikipedia.

399
00:27:29,730 --> 00:27:33,790
I am a PR one of the
funders of Wiki Tribune. Uh,

400
00:27:33,810 --> 00:27:35,610
but that's not a Wikipedia thing.

401
00:27:35,880 --> 00:27:39,180
Although oddly last week
in Miami at a conference,

402
00:27:39,450 --> 00:27:44,040
I saw Jimmy plus a or reach who are
the cofounders of Reiki Tribune.

403
00:27:45,720 --> 00:27:48,810
So the deal here is on
the craigslist side,

404
00:27:49,440 --> 00:27:54,440
a business model of doing well by doing
good with a lot of luck can do pretty

405
00:27:56,071 --> 00:28:00,350
well. And I feel I, uh, well if you may,

406
00:28:00,351 --> 00:28:01,740
if you're lucky enough to do well,

407
00:28:02,100 --> 00:28:07,100
you should help the next people do well
and you should practice what you preach,

408
00:28:07,920 --> 00:28:12,630
which includes, um, treating people
like he wanted to be treated.

409
00:28:13,290 --> 00:28:15,780
I can go on quite a long time,
but I'm going to stop there.

410
00:28:17,670 --> 00:28:19,770
Thank you very much.
Um,

411
00:28:20,250 --> 00:28:25,250
I think you've mentioned that in 2011
that you started to come to crack next and

412
00:28:26,611 --> 00:28:30,930
in 2015 you decided to launch the crack.

413
00:28:30,931 --> 00:28:34,230
You Mark Foundation,
even based on the name,

414
00:28:34,231 --> 00:28:39,030
I think are quite different approaches
behind dad's message. Right?

415
00:28:39,330 --> 00:28:41,620
So,
uh,

416
00:28:42,150 --> 00:28:45,420
you're making a correct inference
regarding the names. It just,

417
00:28:45,640 --> 00:28:48,210
it didn't work out that way.
Um,

418
00:28:48,540 --> 00:28:53,540
I remember 2011 I wanted to have a brand
that would be catchy and effective.

419
00:28:55,260 --> 00:29:00,260
The best we could think of a cracker next
just failed because no one knows what

420
00:29:00,631 --> 00:29:05,040
Craig is. Craig Newmark foundation
or Craig Newmark philanthropies.

421
00:29:05,580 --> 00:29:09,060
People know what that is.
And interestingly,

422
00:29:09,330 --> 00:29:14,330
I hear rumors that people in New York
may know more about who Craig Newmark is.

423
00:29:15,090 --> 00:29:16,170
Then in the bay area,

424
00:29:17,100 --> 00:29:21,270
the advantage there is that New
York is the country's hub of news,

425
00:29:21,271 --> 00:29:24,810
media and influence and connection.
This isn't it.

426
00:29:25,800 --> 00:29:30,800
And what I want to do are things that
contribute as I pushed my efforts,

427
00:29:31,410 --> 00:29:36,410
I want to contribute towards a new
normal of trustworthy news and that means

428
00:29:36,601 --> 00:29:40,110
things that I do have to
be noticed to be effective.

429
00:29:41,110 --> 00:29:41,950
I think we are

430
00:29:42,400 --> 00:29:44,350
in about,
it's about,

431
00:29:44,351 --> 00:29:47,990
we have about 20 minutes
left and then we can um,

432
00:29:48,100 --> 00:29:51,190
have some questions
that was from the dory.

433
00:29:51,250 --> 00:29:55,270
And also you're more than
welcome to use that mic for, uh,

434
00:29:55,271 --> 00:29:56,770
for life questions says,
well,

435
00:29:57,880 --> 00:30:01,330
I can ask a question that
was from Googlers RSVP.

436
00:30:02,140 --> 00:30:03,360
One of them is,
uh,

437
00:30:03,380 --> 00:30:07,480
I haven't been using CEO at least for
at least 10 years and cannot pass it up

438
00:30:07,481 --> 00:30:12,250
the moment to thank you for making a
huge impact to every day Americans like

439
00:30:12,251 --> 00:30:13,030
myself.

440
00:30:13,030 --> 00:30:17,350
The question is what inspire you to be
able to crack list in the first place?

441
00:30:18,060 --> 00:30:18,880
Uh,

442
00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:20,410
it literally is just the,
uh,

443
00:30:20,411 --> 00:30:25,411
the sense that I should give back because
on the well and using it newsgroups

444
00:30:26,200 --> 00:30:30,160
even back in the early nineties,
I was told the craziness,

445
00:30:30,250 --> 00:30:33,670
there were still a lot of people
who would help each other out,

446
00:30:33,880 --> 00:30:37,900
sometimes contributing
expensive consulting time.

447
00:30:38,380 --> 00:30:42,880
There were a couple of dramatic
cases on the, well, we're a doctor,

448
00:30:43,080 --> 00:30:46,630
help save people.
So that's it.

449
00:30:46,631 --> 00:30:51,220
The idea is that I'm getting such good
stuff from this community I should give

450
00:30:51,221 --> 00:30:52,690
back.
And it felt right,

451
00:30:53,990 --> 00:30:56,470
but why was it very difficult to get?

452
00:30:56,530 --> 00:31:00,510
Because at the time there was not
much of that services, right? Uh,

453
00:31:00,760 --> 00:31:05,760
even 250 of the subscribers at
the time who were appropriate,

454
00:31:06,401 --> 00:31:09,670
but using maybe phone lines
and modems to dial. Right.

455
00:31:09,700 --> 00:31:12,890
If you think about that has quite
difficult. What, what's the, uh,

456
00:31:13,120 --> 00:31:16,060
the biggest challenge in the
early earliest days? Yeah,

457
00:31:16,190 --> 00:31:17,510
I think I started by the way,

458
00:31:17,511 --> 00:31:22,511
with the 9,696 scoreboard modem or 9.6
kilowatt modem and I remember when 56 was

459
00:31:25,341 --> 00:31:29,280
a big deal. Um, but uh,

460
00:31:31,190 --> 00:31:32,360
can you repeat that again?

461
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:35,800
What was your biggest
challenge in the earliest days

462
00:31:36,130 --> 00:31:38,590
challenge in terms of growing?
Well,

463
00:31:38,591 --> 00:31:42,850
the good part was I wasn't thinking
about growing things grew word of mouth.

464
00:31:43,120 --> 00:31:46,180
If someone at a company
was getting the mailings,

465
00:31:46,181 --> 00:31:51,130
they would share it with other people
in the same company and then that person

466
00:31:51,131 --> 00:31:54,670
would send me an email saying,
put me on the email list.

467
00:31:55,270 --> 00:31:56,500
That worked pretty well.

468
00:31:56,920 --> 00:32:01,920
Something that helped accelerate this
was that this was a 95 when the Dotcom

469
00:32:03,100 --> 00:32:06,850
boom was just hitting San Francisco.
And uh,

470
00:32:07,600 --> 00:32:10,830
that accelerated things,
a phenomenon back there.

471
00:32:10,831 --> 00:32:15,470
I've got like lots of launch
parties, some open, some closed. Uh,

472
00:32:15,480 --> 00:32:19,180
Patty Baran did something called SF girl.

473
00:32:19,690 --> 00:32:24,690
Her specialty was finding launch parties
and telling people how to get into them

474
00:32:26,680 --> 00:32:28,120
even if they were closed.

475
00:32:28,990 --> 00:32:33,820
My only distinct memory from that time
was that the, uh, new at that time,

476
00:32:34,090 --> 00:32:37,810
San Francisco Museum of
Modern Art in the entry,

477
00:32:37,811 --> 00:32:42,650
they had lots of food and they
were a big mounds of fresh shrimp.

478
00:32:43,850 --> 00:32:47,840
And that was my favorite memory
of that, uh, of that era.

479
00:32:48,610 --> 00:32:52,210
It was people were spending way too much
money on this kind of thing. You know,

480
00:32:52,220 --> 00:32:55,880
if you watch HBO, Silicon Valley,
you'll see a lot of the, uh,

481
00:32:56,150 --> 00:33:00,900
that history being recapitulated.
Okay. Oh, take one,

482
00:33:00,950 --> 00:33:05,360
a live question. Thank you for
joining us today. Um, there's so many,

483
00:33:05,600 --> 00:33:09,710
Geez, globally. Um, do you
have things like, Fred,

484
00:33:09,711 --> 00:33:12,980
this is a great for you moved to
the city and I need a free coach.

485
00:33:13,670 --> 00:33:17,120
And for the most people that done one
already, is there other things like, uh,

486
00:33:17,360 --> 00:33:21,380
that you're looking at advice,
um,

487
00:33:22,630 --> 00:33:23,463
Aye

488
00:33:23,950 --> 00:33:27,610
and frustrated in that I'm
not smart enough to think
of really good things to do.

489
00:33:28,330 --> 00:33:32,470
What I have done at, partly through
a charity called in Venio in this,

490
00:33:32,471 --> 00:33:33,610
in San Francisco,

491
00:33:34,090 --> 00:33:39,090
is to help get refugee centers and so
on and related efforts wired up for the

492
00:33:39,731 --> 00:33:44,731
Internet because the aid workers say
that they need internet connectivity for

493
00:33:45,641 --> 00:33:50,590
various purposes. For example, in
that we did that in a Haiti that is,

494
00:33:50,591 --> 00:33:53,920
I helped by funding in Haiti.
Uh,

495
00:33:53,921 --> 00:33:58,060
and just yesterday I was reminded that
I helped get wired up the, the dob,

496
00:33:58,660 --> 00:34:00,100
um,
refugee camp,

497
00:34:00,340 --> 00:34:04,240
which may be the largest in the world
and I think it's in northern Africa

498
00:34:04,241 --> 00:34:05,074
someplace.

499
00:34:05,290 --> 00:34:10,290
I'd forgotten all about it until I saw a
reference because of the keyword search

500
00:34:10,630 --> 00:34:14,830
in Google news yesterday and again,
literally yesterday.

501
00:34:15,790 --> 00:34:16,623
Um,

502
00:34:16,780 --> 00:34:21,280
there's been all other ones too when
the Obama administration was trying a

503
00:34:21,281 --> 00:34:23,470
serious outreach to the Islamic world,

504
00:34:23,890 --> 00:34:27,520
I helped wire up the vocational
schools in the West Bank.

505
00:34:28,120 --> 00:34:32,560
Now we have something going
on a island in Lake Victoria.

506
00:34:33,280 --> 00:34:35,980
We are there, we're helping
provide internet conductivity.

507
00:34:36,670 --> 00:34:38,440
But there it's because people need it,

508
00:34:38,710 --> 00:34:42,990
but it's also a lure into a
facility to get people tested,

509
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:46,660
tested for HIV because
culturally speaking,

510
00:34:46,930 --> 00:34:51,760
it's really hard to get
people to get tested, but they
all want to be on the net.

511
00:34:52,870 --> 00:34:54,280
So those are small things.

512
00:34:54,850 --> 00:34:59,850
Nowadays I'm thinking I'm specializing
because in our country maybe we have an

513
00:35:00,071 --> 00:35:05,071
all hands on deck situation where
things have gotten bad and we need to do

514
00:35:05,711 --> 00:35:08,650
something good like protecting the vote,

515
00:35:09,250 --> 00:35:13,180
like a stopping a bad actors,

516
00:35:13,240 --> 00:35:18,160
Russians or otherwise from contaminating
the news because you really can't run a

517
00:35:18,161 --> 00:35:23,161
democracy if the normal national
conversation has a lot of lying going on.

518
00:35:25,030 --> 00:35:27,430
Thank you.
Thank you.

519
00:35:29,040 --> 00:35:30,900
And we have another question from Dory.

520
00:35:31,510 --> 00:35:32,343
Uh,

521
00:35:34,250 --> 00:35:38,970
I think this is related to orient to
related to, um, the involvement of, uh,

522
00:35:39,930 --> 00:35:42,870
of the, of the management.
But the question is,

523
00:35:42,871 --> 00:35:47,010
I can think of many ways the crack glass
can improve and wondering what's the

524
00:35:47,011 --> 00:35:51,780
roadmap and why does crack less seems
reluctant to take it to the next level.

525
00:35:52,420 --> 00:35:56,670
Um, well for any of that since
I'm not involved in management,

526
00:35:57,030 --> 00:35:59,940
email something to jim@craigslist.org.

527
00:36:00,720 --> 00:36:04,950
Don't send any intellectual
property and uh,

528
00:36:05,070 --> 00:36:09,420
hopefully you've gotten the lecture about
protecting that if not hear from the

529
00:36:09,421 --> 00:36:12,930
folks on Hbo, Silicon Valley. Um,

530
00:36:13,290 --> 00:36:15,870
so please do that.
Bear in mind,

531
00:36:15,910 --> 00:36:20,700
that's what people seem to need is
not fancy stuff but effective stuff.

532
00:36:21,090 --> 00:36:25,020
Fast and simple is always
big regarding the next level.

533
00:36:25,500 --> 00:36:27,330
I don't know what the next level is,

534
00:36:27,660 --> 00:36:31,650
but if you're helping people put food
on the table, that's pretty good.

535
00:36:31,651 --> 00:36:33,510
Next level to me.
Right.

536
00:36:33,780 --> 00:36:38,670
I asked me actually think of a
followup question on that. Like, um,

537
00:36:39,330 --> 00:36:44,330
in terms of funding in from
the funder Craiglist uh,

538
00:36:44,610 --> 00:36:49,080
you have been very conservative in
turning down and turned out a lot of

539
00:36:49,081 --> 00:36:51,810
investment ask. Right? Uh,

540
00:36:52,080 --> 00:36:57,080
and have you ever wondering that
with more resource like money,

541
00:36:57,750 --> 00:37:02,750
that quick list would be able to have
more resources in fighting like scams and

542
00:37:03,580 --> 00:37:04,413
spams.

543
00:37:05,670 --> 00:37:10,470
And this also really applies to not just
craigslist but also maybe we compete

544
00:37:10,471 --> 00:37:15,270
here and when, and maybe the
of the overall news community,

545
00:37:15,840 --> 00:37:16,673
maybe,
uh,

546
00:37:17,010 --> 00:37:22,010
what we need is a crush project to
Manhattan project in terms of the software

547
00:37:23,760 --> 00:37:28,760
which can figure out that intent on
the part of a posting of any sort.

548
00:37:29,610 --> 00:37:33,900
A posting could be an ad or a comment.
Um,

549
00:37:34,050 --> 00:37:36,540
that would be really,
really smart software.

550
00:37:36,720 --> 00:37:40,980
I don't think it exists and I don't
think it's going to exist anytime soon.

551
00:37:41,640 --> 00:37:45,600
Maybe I should, uh, offer a
really big price for that.

552
00:37:46,650 --> 00:37:48,140
And maybe that would be a,

553
00:37:48,930 --> 00:37:53,280
maybe that would be a useful since
I don't think it exists. Yeah.

554
00:37:53,430 --> 00:37:58,170
But we do, uh, we do needs
that, that kind of thing. Um,

555
00:37:58,550 --> 00:38:03,030
there are, again, those are those people
who think software that smart, uh,

556
00:38:03,090 --> 00:38:07,440
could achieve self awareness and you know,

557
00:38:07,560 --> 00:38:09,990
you hope it's the nice
kind of self awareness.

558
00:38:09,991 --> 00:38:14,991
Like the like the AI is that we in banks
culture novels and not the murderous

559
00:38:15,781 --> 00:38:20,460
pistol wielding robots of Westworld.
Although that is a really good show.

560
00:38:22,170 --> 00:38:24,360
Thank you.
We have another light questions.

561
00:38:24,880 --> 00:38:27,960
I thank you for being here and sharing
our story and you appreciate it.

562
00:38:28,780 --> 00:38:33,220
You seem like a really humble person, but
I last us anyways. When you look back,

563
00:38:33,790 --> 00:38:37,420
what is the biggest you think you
did and what did you learn from it?

564
00:38:37,920 --> 00:38:38,850
Our big,
well,

565
00:38:38,930 --> 00:38:42,870
the big mistake as a company was not
seizing control and determining our own

566
00:38:42,871 --> 00:38:46,140
narrative.
When you're not telling your own story,

567
00:38:46,710 --> 00:38:50,880
other people can tell it and most
of them will be good, some are bad,

568
00:38:50,910 --> 00:38:55,530
some of them will be running scams of one
sort or another. That's why on a, yeah,

569
00:38:55,531 --> 00:39:00,531
in 2010 I started doing it for myself
and I've stumbled along the way,

570
00:39:01,800 --> 00:39:04,200
but now I have a really
good from helping me out.

571
00:39:05,250 --> 00:39:08,100
The thing is that you do need
good smart people doing that.

572
00:39:08,790 --> 00:39:12,810
I like Marc Benioff at salesforce
does a great job of it.

573
00:39:13,260 --> 00:39:17,160
There are other dotcoms who've
done a terrible job of it.

574
00:39:17,580 --> 00:39:21,360
Even when people like me are trying to
help them and to try to do a little wake

575
00:39:21,361 --> 00:39:22,194
up call

576
00:39:25,180 --> 00:39:26,930
free to ask a live question.

577
00:39:30,740 --> 00:39:31,573
Um,

578
00:39:32,040 --> 00:39:34,980
I was wondering if you had any advice
in general around creating the Internet,

579
00:39:34,981 --> 00:39:35,970
why communities?

580
00:39:36,060 --> 00:39:39,390
Like how would you handle that scale
of people or what advice you'd give to

581
00:39:39,860 --> 00:39:44,340
companies or startups or nonprofits
trying to create Internet scale?

582
00:39:45,120 --> 00:39:45,820
Uh,

583
00:39:45,820 --> 00:39:49,270
I don't have broad overall, uh, oh,

584
00:39:49,271 --> 00:39:53,050
a advice just to watch out
that user generated content.

585
00:39:53,410 --> 00:39:57,550
We'll have a moderation problem and there
was a number of unsolved problems with

586
00:39:57,551 --> 00:40:01,440
it.
Yeah.

587
00:40:01,660 --> 00:40:05,860
And right now that's in major flux
right now, somewhere in the alphabet.

588
00:40:06,280 --> 00:40:10,660
There's a jigsaw,
I think that's Jared a Cohen.

589
00:40:10,720 --> 00:40:14,230
I keep forgetting his last name.
Working directly with Eric Schmidt.

590
00:40:14,680 --> 00:40:18,910
They think they have a handle
on the problem. I don't know.

591
00:40:19,240 --> 00:40:21,730
But uh,
that's something which is badly needed.

592
00:40:22,210 --> 00:40:27,010
There are folks who are doing a big
work with machine learning here and that

593
00:40:27,011 --> 00:40:30,960
may, that may lead the
path. But again, uh,

594
00:40:31,810 --> 00:40:32,643
um,

595
00:40:32,890 --> 00:40:37,890
no one knows how were machine learning
is going to lead us and I am kind of

596
00:40:38,141 --> 00:40:40,090
excited about it.
But remember,

597
00:40:40,091 --> 00:40:43,300
I've been reading science
fiction for over 50 years.

598
00:40:45,910 --> 00:40:48,990
How about I put the question
on the other way. Uh,

599
00:40:49,690 --> 00:40:52,360
so you had been a nerd and the,

600
00:40:52,420 --> 00:40:55,450
the credit list is actually a
very successful community, right?

601
00:40:55,451 --> 00:40:59,830
If we want to learn from how to create
a white can come internet community,

602
00:41:00,040 --> 00:41:05,040
what are things that were not coding
or technical but the things that you've

603
00:41:05,201 --> 00:41:05,590
done,

604
00:41:05,590 --> 00:41:09,850
what are the practices and strategy in
the early days that you think is part of

605
00:41:09,851 --> 00:41:12,880
the success of this
creating this community?

606
00:41:13,170 --> 00:41:14,003
Um,

607
00:41:14,560 --> 00:41:19,560
the success factor is doing one's best
to provide a customer service that's

608
00:41:19,571 --> 00:41:23,290
serious. Again, the challenge when
you're saying it's mostly free,

609
00:41:24,350 --> 00:41:25,183
um,

610
00:41:25,390 --> 00:41:29,740
that was the big thing right there because
the initial spirit that this site was

611
00:41:29,741 --> 00:41:32,640
about giving people a break,
uh,

612
00:41:32,650 --> 00:41:35,960
and people see that by accident,

613
00:41:36,290 --> 00:41:38,120
that proved to be a good start,

614
00:41:38,330 --> 00:41:43,330
a good initial culture or where as people
like to say it's in our DNA and that's

615
00:41:44,001 --> 00:41:45,260
managed to succeed.

616
00:41:47,290 --> 00:41:52,150
Is there any challenge to
work with volunteers with
volunteers in the early ages?

617
00:41:52,180 --> 00:41:53,013
Oh,
thank you.

618
00:41:53,830 --> 00:41:57,820
You mentioned a lot of them are volunteers
in that first year as a volunteer

619
00:41:57,821 --> 00:42:00,840
thing failed because you can't,
uh,

620
00:42:00,850 --> 00:42:03,430
you can't tell a volunteer to like,

621
00:42:03,740 --> 00:42:07,330
do you think you just can't tell them
that their job depends on getting

622
00:42:07,331 --> 00:42:11,110
something done at a certain time?
Because if they're volunteers,

623
00:42:11,350 --> 00:42:15,310
you can't withdraw their pay.
So companies,

624
00:42:16,030 --> 00:42:20,980
I guess the company in human history is
quite an invention to make things work

625
00:42:21,250 --> 00:42:24,540
that otherwise I wouldn't work. So, uh,

626
00:42:24,550 --> 00:42:26,530
you normally don't think
of it as an invention,

627
00:42:27,160 --> 00:42:32,160
but it is and he is that and it is an
invention of the way how people can

628
00:42:32,231 --> 00:42:36,430
collaborate. Right. Yeah. Yeah. That's
taken nother, uh, life questions.

629
00:42:37,180 --> 00:42:41,240
Thanks for coming here. Um,
again, very, uh, interested in,

630
00:42:41,241 --> 00:42:45,730
in your story and that was really
good to hear from you. Um, my,

631
00:42:45,760 --> 00:42:47,770
I guess my question is,
you know,

632
00:42:47,950 --> 00:42:49,990
you mentioned that people
come to you and to say,

633
00:42:50,020 --> 00:42:53,680
do you have advice for creating
the craigslist? Oh Huh. Um,

634
00:42:54,070 --> 00:42:57,580
I do find the fundamental
principle of Craig's list as a,

635
00:42:57,640 --> 00:42:59,410
as a product very interesting,

636
00:42:59,411 --> 00:43:03,730
which is connecting people who need
things with connecting people who want

637
00:43:03,731 --> 00:43:08,560
things in a single place of exchange,
right? In a very fundamental level.

638
00:43:08,561 --> 00:43:11,410
Like maybe airbnb is even trying
to do that, which is, you know,

639
00:43:11,411 --> 00:43:14,860
I have some leftover things and if some
people can pay me for some of these

640
00:43:14,861 --> 00:43:18,460
things, I'm curious to know for
all the ones that you heard,

641
00:43:19,150 --> 00:43:21,330
can I create a Craig list of whatever?
What are the,

642
00:43:21,340 --> 00:43:23,590
some of the most interesting things?

643
00:43:23,591 --> 00:43:25,750
What are some of the most
successful things or even weirder?

644
00:43:26,890 --> 00:43:27,480
Uh,

645
00:43:27,480 --> 00:43:31,620
I don't pay much attention to the people
who make businesses out of that because

646
00:43:31,621 --> 00:43:35,670
I, yeah, I guess I just
don't care. I mean,

647
00:43:35,671 --> 00:43:38,910
that's a distraction. The
best kind of things, uh,

648
00:43:38,911 --> 00:43:43,911
where people manage to make it a little
business out of finding junk stuff and

649
00:43:44,401 --> 00:43:49,080
then rebuilding it and making it
into something real. And until today,

650
00:43:49,081 --> 00:43:52,650
I couldn't think of a good example,
except again, I just gave a,

651
00:43:52,651 --> 00:43:57,651
I was on a panel at Sanford business
school are a kid who must've been 20,

652
00:43:57,931 --> 00:43:59,370
but look 14 to me,

653
00:43:59,760 --> 00:44:04,170
but he made a business out of going
to the junk yards in his neighborhood.

654
00:44:04,860 --> 00:44:09,840
Um, finding old bikes, uh,
rebuilding them and selling them.

655
00:44:10,140 --> 00:44:11,090
And that,
uh,

656
00:44:11,220 --> 00:44:15,780
was a way that he saved up
enough for whatever he needed.

657
00:44:15,930 --> 00:44:20,850
Maybe a little bit for a
college or something like
that. That feels really good.

658
00:44:21,570 --> 00:44:25,740
And there's been other things too because
during the recession, around 2008,

659
00:44:25,741 --> 00:44:26,820
2009,

660
00:44:27,660 --> 00:44:32,230
I could see a lot of people
who really were lying on a,

661
00:44:32,610 --> 00:44:34,920
our site for advertising.

662
00:44:35,280 --> 00:44:40,110
They were relying on it for barter because
sometimes that's the only way you're

663
00:44:40,111 --> 00:44:44,090
going to get what you need in a recession.
And a,

664
00:44:44,170 --> 00:44:48,570
that lasted a couple of years I
think. So we have all these, uh,

665
00:44:49,020 --> 00:44:53,310
things happen that does feel pretty good.
But meanwhile,

666
00:44:53,550 --> 00:44:57,840
in these philanthropic areas I
have, we have real challenges. Um,

667
00:44:57,841 --> 00:45:02,730
again on Craig Newmark, freelance
reason.org. That's how I'm a Ho.

668
00:45:02,731 --> 00:45:06,840
That's sound getting this, uh, uh,
this stuff done the best I can.

669
00:45:07,350 --> 00:45:10,590
I should mention that I'm not restricting
myself completely to those sick,

670
00:45:10,650 --> 00:45:14,940
those four areas. I'm working
with some groups on food security,

671
00:45:15,660 --> 00:45:18,210
like a meals on wheels kinds of things,

672
00:45:18,211 --> 00:45:22,590
delivering hot food to people or whatever.
Like in New York in particular,

673
00:45:22,800 --> 00:45:24,930
I support God's love we deliver,

674
00:45:25,530 --> 00:45:29,790
which when you say it fast
is God's lovely liver. Um,

675
00:45:30,060 --> 00:45:34,710
and I also support a pigeon rescue
because I know how important that is to

676
00:45:34,711 --> 00:45:35,544
everyone.

677
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:41,000
I've also learned there that pigeon
pants is a thing and that you want the

678
00:45:41,041 --> 00:45:45,840
pigeon to be wearing the pants
before they fly onto your shoulder.

679
00:45:45,990 --> 00:45:47,790
Two cool.
Lovingly at you.

680
00:45:48,570 --> 00:45:52,710
If they do first and then
the pants are put on,

681
00:45:52,920 --> 00:45:55,770
you may have a problem.
And I did,

682
00:45:57,960 --> 00:45:59,550
although I do like pigeons a lot.

683
00:46:02,850 --> 00:46:05,190
We have some question from the dory again,

684
00:46:05,260 --> 00:46:09,750
I think the live streaming people
are now sending the questions.

685
00:46:10,080 --> 00:46:14,640
One question is a Craiglist
has notoriously not modernized.

686
00:46:14,680 --> 00:46:19,230
It's a design and Ux. What's
the reasoning afford this? Well,

687
00:46:19,530 --> 00:46:23,670
I can't speak for the whole company,
but if you look at the site,

688
00:46:24,200 --> 00:46:28,530
we've been incrementally making
improvements in it, uh, for years.

689
00:46:28,830 --> 00:46:32,310
Both improvements that you
can see like the database,

690
00:46:32,580 --> 00:46:37,560
like the thumbnail sketches and all
that and the people who use the site say

691
00:46:37,830 --> 00:46:41,580
this is what they want. So we've
made a lot of improvements that way.

692
00:46:41,940 --> 00:46:43,950
There's a lot of improvements
that you can't see,

693
00:46:44,160 --> 00:46:48,420
like improved caching and
efforts to keep the site fast.

694
00:46:48,750 --> 00:46:53,750
Speed is a design principle and it's
a really important design principle.

695
00:46:54,090 --> 00:46:57,030
And yeah, Google does a lot
of things along those lines.

696
00:46:57,540 --> 00:47:02,070
Like something I have to look into
is a better use of a Google domain,

697
00:47:02,140 --> 00:47:03,000
a service.

698
00:47:03,300 --> 00:47:08,300
Because I have my real doubts regarding
both my ISP that all three of my ISP

699
00:47:10,020 --> 00:47:14,130
because something tells me their
DNS look ups are a kind of sluggish.

700
00:47:14,670 --> 00:47:19,230
I should also count the hotel I usually
stay at in New York because their ISP

701
00:47:19,231 --> 00:47:21,990
kind of, uh, fails to deliver.

702
00:47:22,320 --> 00:47:26,880
But I'm hoping not to be in
there much longer. You, uh,

703
00:47:26,900 --> 00:47:31,900
I have a question that daddy is
the integration of a blockchain.

704
00:47:32,860 --> 00:47:35,650
The questions says, I'm
personally really, uh,

705
00:47:35,651 --> 00:47:40,030
appreciate Wikipedia and crack and list
as the three layers of knowledge and

706
00:47:40,031 --> 00:47:41,920
marketing information in the economy.

707
00:47:42,250 --> 00:47:46,600
Have you considered blockchain
integration in which you could create pure

708
00:47:46,601 --> 00:47:50,260
decentralized Craiglist
and token nomics around it,

709
00:47:50,680 --> 00:47:54,580
but what's your view in general on that
and how can people can collaborate?

710
00:47:54,581 --> 00:47:58,300
So a blockchain is applied to
the craigslist. I just saw mill,

711
00:47:58,301 --> 00:47:59,200
which was working on,

712
00:48:00,040 --> 00:48:05,040
what I'm thinking is that blockchain based
identity verified identity might be a

713
00:48:05,231 --> 00:48:07,840
way that we can get a lot more
accountability on the net.

714
00:48:08,410 --> 00:48:12,070
And like when you get a scam
sent to you or a piece of spam,

715
00:48:12,730 --> 00:48:16,720
you'd like to hold the center a
carnival to that, that's good.

716
00:48:17,080 --> 00:48:18,790
But on the net,

717
00:48:19,030 --> 00:48:22,630
we're always going to need places
where you can be completely anonymous,

718
00:48:23,110 --> 00:48:27,580
places for dissidents, whistleblowers, uh,

719
00:48:27,760 --> 00:48:31,780
people who may be in a really
bad domestic abuse situation.

720
00:48:32,200 --> 00:48:37,200
We're always going to need places
where verified identity is not good.

721
00:48:37,430 --> 00:48:42,400
We're in anonymity is good. Uh, this
may also apply, and this is a big thing.

722
00:48:42,730 --> 00:48:46,760
The European Union now has this
GDPR standard. Uh, it's, uh,

723
00:48:47,110 --> 00:48:52,110
a set of standards which allow consumers
to control the data passed between

724
00:48:52,151 --> 00:48:56,650
publishers and advertisers.
And, uh, my gut,

725
00:48:56,830 --> 00:49:01,830
my gut feeling is that blockchain based
to control of an individual's data will

726
00:49:03,941 --> 00:49:08,941
be away to make everyone happy in terms
of the data about a consumer that a

727
00:49:11,261 --> 00:49:15,100
advertiser and publisher can chair.
Cause I don't know about you,

728
00:49:15,101 --> 00:49:18,400
but I want control of that,
that kind of data.

729
00:49:19,090 --> 00:49:23,170
And I do want to be served ads,
which actually means something to me.

730
00:49:24,340 --> 00:49:26,980
You know, sometimes it's mixed
because my wife and they are shit.

731
00:49:27,310 --> 00:49:29,530
My wife and I share an Amazon account,

732
00:49:30,160 --> 00:49:34,630
especially when she's buying things for
the nephews and nieces and we've got 21

733
00:49:34,631 --> 00:49:37,840
of them. So odd things up in my, uh,

734
00:49:38,350 --> 00:49:41,380
in my Amazon profile.
That's okay.

735
00:49:41,710 --> 00:49:46,210
But I want the ability to control that
blockchain may be the way to do that.

736
00:49:47,920 --> 00:49:52,170
And do you think it also may help
in turn and stuff that say, um,

737
00:49:53,380 --> 00:49:57,640
uh, the chew news and uh, uh,
fighting the fake news thing,

738
00:49:57,880 --> 00:50:01,990
for example? I don't know honestly
what role they play in that.

739
00:50:02,320 --> 00:50:06,620
That's something that people
smarter than me are working on. Um,

740
00:50:06,910 --> 00:50:09,370
my gut tells me that,
uh,

741
00:50:09,400 --> 00:50:14,120
like one of the biggest things that need
to happen are the fact checkers. Uh,

742
00:50:14,200 --> 00:50:18,170
I like at the international fact checking
network and the tech and check people

743
00:50:18,171 --> 00:50:20,800
let Duke they like if you,

744
00:50:20,940 --> 00:50:25,940
if fact checking in real time is really
hard because if someone lies to the,

745
00:50:28,400 --> 00:50:32,300
um, and the newspapers and so
on and report it, you know, it,

746
00:50:32,390 --> 00:50:35,840
they may only realized that
it's a lie an hour after.

747
00:50:36,620 --> 00:50:39,560
So we're talking about
summary fact checking,

748
00:50:40,100 --> 00:50:45,100
meaning that a person or a news outlet
will have a track record in terms of how

749
00:50:46,071 --> 00:50:49,620
honest they are not. And I think
that's going to need a lot of, uh,

750
00:50:50,090 --> 00:50:53,590
that's gonna need a lot of
work because frankly, um,

751
00:50:54,170 --> 00:50:59,170
it's not hard to figure out what news
outlets try to get things right and which

752
00:50:59,361 --> 00:51:02,180
news outlets deliberately
get things wrong.

753
00:51:02,630 --> 00:51:07,630
The idea is how do you do it so that no
one is an arbiter of truth is no one,

754
00:51:08,361 --> 00:51:11,300
no single group or anything.
We'll arbitrary truth.

755
00:51:11,630 --> 00:51:15,710
Instead you have a large network of
networks and that's what's happening right

756
00:51:15,711 --> 00:51:19,780
now. Maybe not fast enough. And I, uh,

757
00:51:20,720 --> 00:51:24,620
just realize another condition
I made put on if I may make,

758
00:51:24,860 --> 00:51:29,450
and I'm going to make a very large
grant to a particular news, uh,

759
00:51:29,690 --> 00:51:33,590
institution because,
you know,

760
00:51:33,591 --> 00:51:38,120
I'm talking about journalism, but I'm
a news consumer and I've learned a lot.

761
00:51:38,360 --> 00:51:42,530
But unless you've been writing to get
to deadline like five times a week,

762
00:51:42,860 --> 00:51:46,790
you don't know journalism because
that's really a tough kind of creative

763
00:51:46,791 --> 00:51:48,420
pressure. You know, I've,

764
00:51:48,500 --> 00:51:51,860
I've been in situations where I've
had to write code to deadline,

765
00:51:52,610 --> 00:51:57,140
but writing stories that deadline is
tougher because you don't know what the

766
00:51:57,141 --> 00:52:00,020
story is at a time.
Whereas if you're coding,

767
00:52:00,200 --> 00:52:02,540
you normally know what kind
of stuff you got to write.

768
00:52:02,840 --> 00:52:05,990
Presumably someone's done
some decent requirements,

769
00:52:05,991 --> 00:52:10,280
definition of the variety,
which is not entirely stupid.

770
00:52:11,000 --> 00:52:13,200
I put that qualification on,
uh,

771
00:52:13,400 --> 00:52:17,060
just reminding people that I worked
in IBM development for six years.

772
00:52:18,110 --> 00:52:22,880
Not that I have anything specific in
mind. Okay. One of the last question.

773
00:52:22,910 --> 00:52:23,743
Uh,

774
00:52:24,080 --> 00:52:29,080
we saw the startup train of pursuing
vertical opportunities of Wa cracking list

775
00:52:29,900 --> 00:52:33,950
is doing for the past decade
as a horizontal company.

776
00:52:33,951 --> 00:52:38,450
I'm wondering what crack list think of
this trend and how crack when we respond

777
00:52:38,451 --> 00:52:40,530
to this trend of the future?
Uh,

778
00:52:41,780 --> 00:52:45,500
I don't think about it much because
I'm focused on philanthropy. Uh,

779
00:52:45,590 --> 00:52:48,740
Jim may be thinking about it,
but you'd have to ask him,

780
00:52:49,910 --> 00:52:53,720
which is not a satisfactory answer.
But again, the deal is that,

781
00:52:54,460 --> 00:52:59,460
and may it's may be a good thing
that like for roughly 10 years,

782
00:53:01,160 --> 00:53:05,720
um, I focused well for, for
10 years I focused on coding,

783
00:53:06,260 --> 00:53:07,790
then customer service.

784
00:53:08,150 --> 00:53:12,410
Then for a lot of that I focused on
customer service and then philanthropy.

785
00:53:13,280 --> 00:53:18,230
Not that I'm a really, really smart in
any of that, but I'm combining the two.

786
00:53:18,400 --> 00:53:18,661
I mean,

787
00:53:18,661 --> 00:53:23,270
I've been lucky enough to do well and
I'm putting my money where my mouth is in

788
00:53:23,271 --> 00:53:25,920
all this. The deal is that, uh, you know,

789
00:53:25,921 --> 00:53:30,921
there's this billionaire's pledge to
give away half of what you've made during

790
00:53:31,201 --> 00:53:34,560
your lifetime. I have a
friend, I'm not being specific,

791
00:53:34,860 --> 00:53:37,410
but I've already exceeded that. I'm, uh,

792
00:53:37,650 --> 00:53:41,810
looking to do more to do
it in smart ways because a,

793
00:53:41,860 --> 00:53:46,860
a democracy cannot survive
built on lies and you know,

794
00:53:47,640 --> 00:53:52,640
we need to fix that and we have some
runway to fix that until things go really

795
00:53:53,011 --> 00:53:57,570
bad. So I'm involved in that kind
of thing. And by but involved,

796
00:53:57,571 --> 00:53:58,260
I mean,

797
00:53:58,260 --> 00:54:02,610
I'm involved in it
literally every day and uh,

798
00:54:03,000 --> 00:54:05,400
you know, that ain't so bad. Again,

799
00:54:05,401 --> 00:54:08,550
there's a lot of people around who are
smarter than me and who do more than me.

800
00:54:08,910 --> 00:54:13,710
My role is to, uh, bring them
together and to get some cash to him.

801
00:54:14,070 --> 00:54:14,903
Not Bad.

802
00:54:16,420 --> 00:54:16,790
Thank you.

803
00:54:16,790 --> 00:54:20,950
I liked thank Craig you mark for being
here and have the conversation with us

804
00:54:21,190 --> 00:54:24,870
and I would like to thank the crew and
all the audience here and young and

805
00:54:24,960 --> 00:54:27,930
livestreaming. Thank you for
being here and please follow up.

806

future events. Thank you very much.

807
00:54:32,770 --> 00:54:33,520
Thank you very much.
