1
00:00:08,300 --> 00:00:10,610
Okay. Everybody. Thank you
guys so much for coming.

2
00:00:10,611 --> 00:00:14,180
We really appreciate you guys coming
out with an awesome talk for you guys.

3
00:00:14,181 --> 00:00:18,800
We have Ben, you simmer.
Mom got over here and, uh,

4
00:00:18,980 --> 00:00:22,520
I'd love to kind of introduce them.
So, uh, Ben, uh, once a Harvard,

5
00:00:22,580 --> 00:00:27,370
he actually dropped out to become a teal
fellow. Uh, 2013, he got into crypto. Uh,

6
00:00:27,450 --> 00:00:30,740
he turned 15 k into what
is now over $1 million. Uh,

7
00:00:30,870 --> 00:00:34,880
he wrote the crypto one on one post on
medium, which is great kind of primer.

8
00:00:34,881 --> 00:00:38,690
If you're not familiar with crypto.
It's a great kind of intro introductory,

9
00:00:38,691 --> 00:00:41,620
just a overview of the space.
Uh,

10
00:00:41,780 --> 00:00:44,090
and so I sent it to a lot of my
friends if they're, you know,

11
00:00:44,120 --> 00:00:46,070
they're not really familiar.
Um,

12
00:00:46,250 --> 00:00:50,200
he actually became a kind of an
internet celebrity in his own right. Uh,

13
00:00:50,201 --> 00:00:55,201
so we got over 50 million Facebook views
on his videos and he realized that he

14
00:00:55,371 --> 00:00:57,770
just didn't profit a
dime off of those videos.

15
00:00:57,770 --> 00:01:00,470
And so he realized that there
was kind of a problem. Uh,

16
00:01:00,500 --> 00:01:05,480
and so he decided to create stream,
which kind of disintermediation, uh,

17
00:01:05,630 --> 00:01:08,480
the creators and the audience,
um,

18
00:01:08,510 --> 00:01:12,770
and allows creators to kind of profit
more and engage more authentically, uh,

19
00:01:12,771 --> 00:01:16,270
with their audience without being
beholden to kind of outside interests. Uh,

20
00:01:16,271 --> 00:01:19,220
so simmer is the other
cofounder of stream. Uh,

21
00:01:19,250 --> 00:01:23,090
he graduated from Stanford where
he studied AI and bio computation.

22
00:01:23,300 --> 00:01:26,150
He built one of the top
14 apps in the APP store,

23
00:01:26,180 --> 00:01:30,530
which gained him recognition from both
the White House and the Department of

24
00:01:30,530 --> 00:01:31,200
Education.
Um,

25
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:34,970
and he built one of the first Ios apps
to do realtime video classification.

26
00:01:35,210 --> 00:01:39,320
So I already touched on what stream does
it disintermediate content creators and,

27
00:01:39,380 --> 00:01:39,941
uh,
and,

28
00:01:39,941 --> 00:01:44,720
and the audience and allows kind of
creators to engage more authentically, uh,

29
00:01:44,750 --> 00:01:48,050
you know, without being beholden to
outside interests. And, uh, yeah.

30
00:01:48,230 --> 00:01:50,630
Without further ado,
I'll give it up for team stream.

31
00:01:53,130 --> 00:01:55,080
Yeah. First off, I just want to

32
00:01:55,140 --> 00:01:58,000
knowledge thank you guys so much for
being here. I know this is lunch time.

33
00:01:58,001 --> 00:02:00,830
Like really appreciate you guys all
coming out and supporting us. Um,

34
00:02:01,210 --> 00:02:03,310
and just listen to what we
have to say. It's always, uh,

35
00:02:03,430 --> 00:02:05,500
it's always definitely a bucket list
side of it's always been on my list.

36
00:02:05,501 --> 00:02:08,110
So thank you so much for bringing us
here and giving us the chance to talk to

37
00:02:08,111 --> 00:02:12,070
you guys. Um, so really quickly,
you know, I think Bitcoin, right?

38
00:02:12,071 --> 00:02:15,120
There's a lot of, if you guys
been falling recently, um,

39
00:02:15,160 --> 00:02:18,070
and this is just like a quick story.
All the rage.

40
00:02:18,071 --> 00:02:20,420
I was literally at Thanksgiving,
this pit. So this pat, you know,

41
00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:25,300
this past Thursday, um, and I was sitting
at the dinner table and my uncles,

42
00:02:25,330 --> 00:02:28,450
my cousins, literally, everybody's
like, how do I get into bitcoin?

43
00:02:28,490 --> 00:02:31,540
Then you hours in crypto. And they
were like, Whoa, like I want to buy.

44
00:02:31,540 --> 00:02:35,560
Like it was like a news. It
was show interesting to kind
of see the energy there.

45
00:02:36,580 --> 00:02:37,210
Cool.

46
00:02:37,210 --> 00:02:40,930
So real quick also I want to give you a
quick background of how everyone is in

47
00:02:40,931 --> 00:02:44,370
this room, right? So raise your pans.
You guys have no exposure to crypto.

48
00:02:44,380 --> 00:02:46,450
You guys want just like
a full introduction.

49
00:02:46,910 --> 00:02:49,870
The only one here who just like it doesn't
know anything about crypto. All right.

50
00:02:49,900 --> 00:02:52,360
How many of you guys actually feel
like you are pretty proficient.

51
00:02:52,361 --> 00:02:56,200
You understand what bitcoin is, how it
works, talking, glue, all those things.

52
00:02:56,201 --> 00:02:59,710
Raise your hands. All right,
cool. Awesome. Awesome.

53
00:03:00,160 --> 00:03:03,490
That's somewhere between
that, right? This is perfect.

54
00:03:03,491 --> 00:03:06,700
That's exactly what the song is. So
awesome. That works all sure. Okay.

55
00:03:06,730 --> 00:03:09,370
So just really quick and you're
going back to the, to the story show.

56
00:03:09,430 --> 00:03:13,150
She comes up to me, she's like, I want
to buy bitcoin. That I was like, okay,

57
00:03:13,151 --> 00:03:16,150
this is, I feel like he's like a
teaching moment. And so I went,

58
00:03:16,210 --> 00:03:20,140
I've got a piece of paper and it was like,
let's make your own coin. Right. And we,

59
00:03:20,260 --> 00:03:24,040
we called it, we called it and Sarah
coin because it was her name. Um,

60
00:03:24,100 --> 00:03:27,970
and it was like, okay, go and see if you
can actually get something from this,

61
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,700
right? You have this piece of
paper, this is your Sarah coin.

62
00:03:30,730 --> 00:03:33,490
Let's see what you can do.
Right. And she went and she got,

63
00:03:33,560 --> 00:03:35,370
she actually like ended up getting like,

64
00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:39,460
she's got an extra slice of Pumpkin
pie by the end of the day. Um,

65
00:03:39,530 --> 00:03:41,860
one thing that's really
interesting and that was,

66
00:03:41,890 --> 00:03:43,810
that was for me like one thing
that's really interesting,

67
00:03:43,811 --> 00:03:46,750
it's like this idea of what
really is money, right?

68
00:03:46,751 --> 00:03:48,940
Like when we think about these coins,
like what does,

69
00:03:49,180 --> 00:03:53,770
what constitutes value in a specific
currency, right? Um, and I think that's,

70
00:03:53,771 --> 00:03:55,610
you know, a lot of we're going
to be touching on today, um,

71
00:03:55,780 --> 00:03:58,930
specifically within our talk is thinking
about what is the history of money in

72
00:03:58,931 --> 00:04:02,170
Bitcoin? How does it actually fit
in? How have we created this? Right?

73
00:04:02,171 --> 00:04:04,500
A lot of people think it's a scam,
it's fake money. Like all this,

74
00:04:04,550 --> 00:04:07,030
like how do we actually think about
this and actually diving in some of the

75
00:04:07,031 --> 00:04:09,460
fundamentals then actually thinking about,
okay,

76
00:04:09,490 --> 00:04:12,610
what are these next layers of technology
smart contract disintermediation,

77
00:04:12,820 --> 00:04:15,790
what does that look like? And then
finally we'll kind of close out with,

78
00:04:15,791 --> 00:04:17,860
I know there's a lot of new
crypto projects coming out,

79
00:04:18,010 --> 00:04:19,750
some of our thoughts on crypto economics.

80
00:04:19,780 --> 00:04:23,380
Where does that actually have space right
in the current ecosystem and what are

81
00:04:23,381 --> 00:04:26,770
the value propositions there by actually
taking a case study through stream?

82
00:04:26,830 --> 00:04:29,010
The project that me and
Ben are both working on.

83
00:04:29,020 --> 00:04:31,590
So at that I'll let Ben kind of
take it away with who had some,

84
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:35,050
a lot of the history of money, uh, in
boy. Yeah. You mind if I grab the clicker,

85
00:04:35,110 --> 00:04:38,020
go for it. Awesome. Sooner. I'm
going to walk through all those,

86
00:04:38,021 --> 00:04:40,960
but also I want to make sure that you
guys are giving the value that you want to

87
00:04:40,961 --> 00:04:42,370
own this. So at any point, you know,

88
00:04:42,610 --> 00:04:45,880
I'm going to stop and have questions
between instruction and then you guys tell

89
00:04:45,881 --> 00:04:47,680
us up. You know, that's
exciting. That's interesting.

90
00:04:47,681 --> 00:04:50,380
Or if you want to dive in to
somebody else. So real quick,

91
00:04:50,710 --> 00:04:54,730
I think it's important to us take bitcoin
in the context of where it came from.

92
00:04:54,731 --> 00:04:56,140
Right?
And what was the motivation behind it.

93
00:04:56,230 --> 00:04:59,260
And there's very clearly motivated
by the 2008 financial crisis.

94
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:04,030
So the bitcoin white paper came out
immediately basically after this happens.

95
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:05,160
And you could see those,

96
00:05:05,170 --> 00:05:08,530
a straw moving factor because in the
first bitcoin transaction that actually,

97
00:05:08,740 --> 00:05:12,040
and I had a headline
from Mica UK newspaper,

98
00:05:12,070 --> 00:05:16,150
whereas like banks are on the brink of
bail out right from governments and so

99
00:05:16,151 --> 00:05:20,650
will happen in 2008 well it's super
interesting because we had a lot of things

100
00:05:20,651 --> 00:05:24,370
that contributed to the financial crisis
and I'm sure you guys are all aware,

101
00:05:24,371 --> 00:05:24,581
right?

102
00:05:24,581 --> 00:05:28,510
The great recession occurred and why have
recurred specifically was because of a

103
00:05:28,511 --> 00:05:31,000
lot of the parts of the
mind, sorry, system today.

104
00:05:31,030 --> 00:05:34,600
So one of the first main parts of how
money works say is fractional reserve

105
00:05:34,601 --> 00:05:37,900
banking.
So real show of hands is anyone Miller?

106
00:05:37,901 --> 00:05:40,350
Warren fractional reserve
banking is, okay. Awesome. Great.

107
00:05:40,360 --> 00:05:42,370
So I'll explain this from scratch.
So one story short,

108
00:05:42,580 --> 00:05:44,770
when you give $1,000 to bank today,

109
00:05:45,220 --> 00:05:49,180
they are legally allowed to go out and
spend up to $900 about money, right?

110
00:05:49,180 --> 00:05:52,570
So they have a requirement that they
have a reserve that they have to keep up

111
00:05:52,610 --> 00:05:53,470
customer deposits.

112
00:05:53,471 --> 00:05:57,070
And that's about 10% so when you
give a bank $100 million right?

113
00:05:57,110 --> 00:05:59,600
They only have to keep
$10 million on hand.

114
00:05:59,900 --> 00:06:03,650
What that leads to our two main problems,
like it happened, right? In most cases,

115
00:06:03,740 --> 00:06:06,350
this is totally fine because if you trust
your bank, you're not going to go out.

116
00:06:06,351 --> 00:06:07,460
You're not going to
take all your money out.

117
00:06:07,461 --> 00:06:12,260
Very rarely do people take more than 10%
of the deposits at one time out of the

118
00:06:12,261 --> 00:06:16,130
bank, right? And only when
that number is reached,

119
00:06:16,340 --> 00:06:19,790
are there any problems? So 90% of
the time, everything's totally fine,

120
00:06:19,820 --> 00:06:23,570
but when people do start to have a panic
or people wanting to take their money

121
00:06:23,571 --> 00:06:26,900
out, or there's some sort of a issue
that they're seeing in the system,

122
00:06:27,080 --> 00:06:29,450
it can collapse very quickly, right?
So you have a liquidity crunch.

123
00:06:29,510 --> 00:06:31,970
So if more than 10% of people
want to take their money out,

124
00:06:32,450 --> 00:06:35,000
then the bank is like, all right,
we can't give you money. Right?

125
00:06:35,001 --> 00:06:37,580
And that's when things start
spiraling in a really bad way,

126
00:06:37,581 --> 00:06:39,320
because that leads to more panic,
right?

127
00:06:39,321 --> 00:06:41,750
And you have this vicious cycle where
more people are trying to take money out.

128
00:06:42,050 --> 00:06:44,960
That's not quite exactly what happened.
2008. That's what happened in say,

129
00:06:44,961 --> 00:06:45,830
the Great Depression,
right?

130
00:06:45,831 --> 00:06:49,940
You have this phenomenon knows as bank
run where all you see these like lines

131
00:06:49,980 --> 00:06:52,280
rather people just outside the
bank trying to get their money.

132
00:06:52,281 --> 00:06:54,650
And that's because the bank
doesn't have your money anymore.

133
00:06:55,040 --> 00:06:58,970
And the other aspect of this that's
really bad though is when they spend your

134
00:06:58,971 --> 00:07:01,280
money, they put it into investments,
right? They're trying to,

135
00:07:01,310 --> 00:07:05,120
they're basically taking your money and
like earning money with your money and

136
00:07:05,270 --> 00:07:07,160
they can do this poorly.
So what actually happened,

137
00:07:07,161 --> 00:07:09,410
2008 was we had the
subprime mortgage crisis.

138
00:07:09,560 --> 00:07:14,560
So they put money in these highly
inflated mortgages that were being,

139
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:18,740
uh, lends out to all these people who
couldn't really pay it back, right?

140
00:07:18,741 --> 00:07:21,980
So then we have this huge problem where
they lost a lot of this money or now

141
00:07:21,981 --> 00:07:24,170
they're left holding these
assets in foreclosure,

142
00:07:24,171 --> 00:07:27,800
which are just worth way less in reality.
Then they were on paper.

143
00:07:27,980 --> 00:07:31,040
And then so the whole system
basically start glossy.

144
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:35,540
And so the government after the
great depression was like, holy crap,

145
00:07:35,541 --> 00:07:38,240
this is really bad. Because in the Great
Depression, all the banks failed, right?

146
00:07:38,510 --> 00:07:40,670
And so they created this
thing called the FDAC, right?

147
00:07:40,671 --> 00:07:44,120
The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation.
So you guys are probably familiar,

148
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:45,650
you know, right now, if
you put your money in bank,

149
00:07:45,651 --> 00:07:49,010
it says $250,000 are insured by the FTC.

150
00:07:49,011 --> 00:07:52,130
And this gives you some of New Year of
like safety. It's like, oh, don't worry.

151
00:07:52,131 --> 00:07:55,100
It's fine if the bank goes down,
the government's got your bag. Well,

152
00:07:55,101 --> 00:07:58,790
the unfortunate thing is the FTC has
actually justice underfunded as banks,

153
00:07:58,791 --> 00:07:59,660
in fact,
more so,

154
00:07:59,810 --> 00:08:03,770
they are legally only required to keep
1% of all customer deposits that they

155
00:08:03,771 --> 00:08:05,030
insure on hands.

156
00:08:05,240 --> 00:08:10,240
So if you can see here f more than
1% of bank deposits are defaulted on.

157
00:08:11,420 --> 00:08:13,970
They actually don't have
the money to save the day.

158
00:08:14,390 --> 00:08:17,030
And so this isn't just a hypothetical,
it's actually happened before.

159
00:08:17,330 --> 00:08:20,900
There's a thing called the savings and
loan crisis back in the 1980s and so in

160
00:08:20,901 --> 00:08:25,280
rapid succession, and again,
things are almost always fine,

161
00:08:25,310 --> 00:08:28,850
but when they go bad, they go bad very
quickly and very Kasra optically, right?

162
00:08:28,851 --> 00:08:31,040
It's a brittle system,
right? So everything's okay,

163
00:08:31,070 --> 00:08:36,070
but when it breaks a showers and so in
the savings and loan crisis of 1980s out

164
00:08:36,591 --> 00:08:41,030
thousand banks, out of the 3,200 of these
bags that are called like saving space,

165
00:08:41,031 --> 00:08:45,260
right? They felled in rapid succession
and there's actually sister insurance

166
00:08:45,261 --> 00:08:49,430
corporation to the see that was the
federal like savings and loans, uh,

167
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:53,420
insurance corporation. And that
immediately was like, holy crap,

168
00:08:53,421 --> 00:08:56,040
we don't have the money to like save
a fraction of these banks. Right?

169
00:08:56,041 --> 00:08:59,820
So they actually had to be recapitalized
again and again with taxpayer money,

170
00:08:59,850 --> 00:09:02,520
which is exactly the same thing
we saw happen, say 2008, right?

171
00:09:02,820 --> 00:09:06,210
Where the government's basically at the
expense of taxpayers saved all these

172
00:09:06,211 --> 00:09:08,850
banks and bailed them out.
And in fact,

173
00:09:08,851 --> 00:09:13,710
even with all these bailouts of
the governments gave f a F, s,

174
00:09:14,100 --> 00:09:18,360
l, I, C or whatever it's called. Um, yeah,

175
00:09:18,390 --> 00:09:23,390
they gave up after only fixing
after basically recovering
about 300 of the banks

176
00:09:25,141 --> 00:09:29,970
out of the 1000 films there. I got
there. I'm good. Cool. Keep it.

177
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,350
They actually dissolved themselves.
Right?

178
00:09:31,380 --> 00:09:34,980
And so we've actually seen this happen
in practice. So the FDI see again,

179
00:09:35,610 --> 00:09:40,020
very poorly capitalized, just like
normal. A normal banks are too.

180
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:41,700
So not that much safety.

181
00:09:42,540 --> 00:09:44,940
And then this problem is actually
compounded by Fiat currency.

182
00:09:44,941 --> 00:09:47,700
So this goes back to the idea of
like what exactly is money, right?

183
00:09:47,880 --> 00:09:48,561
And money today,

184
00:09:48,561 --> 00:09:53,340
as we know it is generally a currency
that's issued and controlled entirely by

185
00:09:53,341 --> 00:09:55,800
government and backed by nothing
but faith and that government.

186
00:09:55,801 --> 00:09:58,920
So in the past we used to have these
things called say gold standards, right?

187
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,360
And that's something that's pretty easy.

188
00:10:00,361 --> 00:10:02,220
It's to understand that it's like at the,
you have a dollar,

189
00:10:02,221 --> 00:10:04,200
you could redeem it for a
certain amount of gold, right?

190
00:10:04,201 --> 00:10:07,770
And so you always knew that your dollar
had value because it was backed by gold.

191
00:10:08,010 --> 00:10:11,640
Now since the 1970s since
the Nixon Nixon shock,

192
00:10:11,700 --> 00:10:14,790
we actually have currencies
are completely free flowing,

193
00:10:14,791 --> 00:10:17,160
darn backed by anything but
trust in the government.

194
00:10:17,530 --> 00:10:21,090
And so this is extremely interesting
because what it means is that if you

195
00:10:21,091 --> 00:10:22,410
actually look through the test of time,

196
00:10:22,411 --> 00:10:27,000
no Fiat currency is actually ever
survived a long enough time scale.

197
00:10:27,030 --> 00:10:29,880
And the reason for that is because you
always have a central point of failure

198
00:10:30,090 --> 00:10:30,900
and the government.

199
00:10:30,900 --> 00:10:34,170
So as long as you trust your government
to be very responsible for your money

200
00:10:34,500 --> 00:10:37,410
throughout its entire history,
then everything's fine,
right? It's totally great.

201
00:10:37,590 --> 00:10:39,600
But that's a, that's a bigF , right?

202
00:10:39,810 --> 00:10:43,620
And in most cases actually you can't
actually trust the government to always be

203
00:10:43,621 --> 00:10:46,740
perfect all the way through, right? And
so they can do a lot of different things.

204
00:10:46,770 --> 00:10:51,120
You know, quantitive quantitative easing
happens now we have, you know, every four,

205
00:10:51,210 --> 00:10:54,240
eight years new president comes in,
right? They change economic policy.

206
00:10:54,370 --> 00:10:56,850
And so you're privy to all these things
that you don't really have that much

207
00:10:56,970 --> 00:11:01,440
agency over but have a huge potential
impact on you. And so we can see this,

208
00:11:01,560 --> 00:11:05,340
some classic examples. For example,
our Zimbabwe, everyone mostly knows,

209
00:11:05,341 --> 00:11:07,160
I guess about what happened there.

210
00:11:07,170 --> 00:11:09,420
This is the classic example of
what hyper inflation can do.

211
00:11:09,570 --> 00:11:13,170
And you can actually see it like really
spirals out in this crazy way over time,

212
00:11:13,171 --> 00:11:16,860
right? So just in a matter of months, it's
like, all right, it's getting pretty bad.

213
00:11:16,890 --> 00:11:20,520
You know, like, uh, your
money's not really worth that
much anymore. And it's like,

214
00:11:20,521 --> 00:11:24,060
all right, things seem like maybe they're
okay, but holy crap, now it's really bad.

215
00:11:24,270 --> 00:11:25,740
And so like at the end of this thing,
right,

216
00:11:25,741 --> 00:11:28,470
it's like you would be in the grocery
store and by the time you entered the

217
00:11:28,471 --> 00:11:29,910
grocery store and by the time you left,

218
00:11:30,030 --> 00:11:33,570
like your money would have like doubled
in like a, it's diluted the value.

219
00:11:34,170 --> 00:11:38,280
And so they ultimately collapsed.
But that is not just,

220
00:11:38,281 --> 00:11:40,230
people think that that's the
domain of just like, you know,

221
00:11:40,231 --> 00:11:43,740
these really third party governments
are really poor. Actually,

222
00:11:44,070 --> 00:11:47,010
it's true right now,
today in Venezuela as well.

223
00:11:47,670 --> 00:11:50,820
But even with the u s when the u s
first started, few people know this.

224
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:55,780
We create a currency called continental
back in 1775 and within three years of

225
00:11:55,781 --> 00:11:59,620
lost 80% of its value within 13 years
in hyperinflated so much that they

226
00:11:59,621 --> 00:12:03,460
actually had to completely
abandon constant downsell
currency and issue an edict

227
00:12:03,520 --> 00:12:06,820
that you can only have currency that
was backed by gold or silver because why

228
00:12:06,821 --> 00:12:10,360
would anyone trust the US government?
Right? And so it's interesting in that.

229
00:12:10,390 --> 00:12:11,480
So let's move,
uh,

230
00:12:11,481 --> 00:12:15,760
it's a good segue into basically gold
and why gold has held its value as a

231
00:12:15,761 --> 00:12:19,750
calorie points, a Fiat currencies
well over 5,000 years plus.

232
00:12:19,780 --> 00:12:24,780
So there's record this and people using
gold as a store value since 3000 BC

233
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:28,960
today, it's still holds its value, in
fact, intelligence value pretty, uh,

234
00:12:29,110 --> 00:12:33,430
well over that entire 5,000 years and
no Fiat currency has ever come close to

235
00:12:33,431 --> 00:12:33,640
that.

236
00:12:33,640 --> 00:12:38,640
So let's explore why that's the case
because it's a good analog to what bitcoin

237
00:12:38,890 --> 00:12:40,900
has this value as its value proposition.

238
00:12:40,901 --> 00:12:45,160
Because bitcoin was actually designed
essentially at one form as a better form

239
00:12:45,161 --> 00:12:49,210
of a gold. So gold has value because
there is no central point of failure.

240
00:12:49,240 --> 00:12:53,740
It's trustless and that you don't have
to depend on the bank or you know,

241
00:12:53,741 --> 00:12:57,700
a central bank or government to
issue gold, you know that. No,

242
00:12:57,790 --> 00:12:59,970
so the problem with a Fiat
currency again is that, um,

243
00:13:00,010 --> 00:13:02,170
the central bank can issue
money on demand, right?

244
00:13:02,530 --> 00:13:06,100
And so when you create new money,
you have flaked the money supply,

245
00:13:06,101 --> 00:13:09,010
but you don't actually change the economy.
So the economy is say,

246
00:13:09,011 --> 00:13:13,420
$100 million and you have $100,000
discount, $100 million, then you know,

247
00:13:13,720 --> 00:13:16,660
um, that's if someone
prints twice as much money,

248
00:13:16,661 --> 00:13:20,110
you're basically diluting everyone
who holds us dollar say, right?

249
00:13:20,110 --> 00:13:21,280
You're having the money supplied.

250
00:13:21,640 --> 00:13:26,350
And so actually in practice we have a
designed inflation rate of an average

251
00:13:26,351 --> 00:13:29,140
about two to 3% every year.
And that doesn't seem like too much.

252
00:13:29,141 --> 00:13:33,250
But compound interest means a about
every 20 years your money halves in real

253
00:13:33,251 --> 00:13:35,710
buying power.
So if you have $100 today,

254
00:13:35,740 --> 00:13:39,100
it's actually getting by basically
$50 worth of things in 20 years.

255
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:43,240
And so gold solves this problem
because it's inherently scarce.

256
00:13:43,270 --> 00:13:46,690
You know that there's no central bank
that could at any point just make more

257
00:13:46,691 --> 00:13:50,200
money. And so because of that,
people will put a lot faith and gold.

258
00:13:50,470 --> 00:13:54,520
And also there's no one part
that you have to trust. And um,

259
00:13:55,840 --> 00:13:58,930
let's see.
There are some caveats of goal too though,

260
00:13:59,230 --> 00:14:02,170
and that we think that it's scarce.

261
00:14:02,350 --> 00:14:04,150
We think that production
can actually increase,

262
00:14:04,151 --> 00:14:05,860
but actually you can because
it's not future proof.

263
00:14:06,090 --> 00:14:09,460
What I mean by future proof
is we've gotten a lot better
and a lot of technology,

264
00:14:09,461 --> 00:14:12,370
right? And part of that technology that
we've gotten better at is mining gold.

265
00:14:12,520 --> 00:14:14,560
So you can actually see here
in the last a hundred years,

266
00:14:14,710 --> 00:14:17,200
our gold production has
about a quadrupled, right?

267
00:14:17,201 --> 00:14:22,180
And so we used to do about 705 tons of
gold production back in 1912. Now in 2014,

268
00:14:22,181 --> 00:14:23,650
we do 2,880.

269
00:14:23,800 --> 00:14:27,310
And that's because it's a lot easier
to my goal today then it was a hundred

270
00:14:27,310 --> 00:14:27,311
years ago.

271
00:14:27,311 --> 00:14:31,090
It's way easier to mind goal today than
it was back in like Roman times. Right?

272
00:14:31,091 --> 00:14:34,720
And so we have this false
sense of the supply is scarce,

273
00:14:34,721 --> 00:14:37,360
but it's actually not that scarce.
And in fact,

274
00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:41,920
half of all the gold as ever been mined
in history has been mined in the last 50

275
00:14:41,921 --> 00:14:44,410
years.
So this is like a pretty wild thing.

276
00:14:44,411 --> 00:14:47,080
And like there are other things
that can happen too. For example,

277
00:14:47,110 --> 00:14:51,530
someone could spontaneously finds a
huge cache of gold in California spark a

278
00:14:51,531 --> 00:14:56,210
gold rush. And so there were all these
things up. While it seems scarce,

279
00:14:56,240 --> 00:14:58,190
it's not quite predictable
and that's important.

280
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:01,070
And so let's compare this with bitcoin.

281
00:15:01,071 --> 00:15:06,071
Let's walk into why bitcoin has value
in the world today as a store of money,

282
00:15:07,461 --> 00:15:08,294
right?

283
00:15:08,390 --> 00:15:13,390
And so bitcoin that like gold is
valuable because it is inherently scarce,

284
00:15:15,410 --> 00:15:18,320
but more so than that it's
also inherently predictable.

285
00:15:18,530 --> 00:15:22,550
And so this is extremely important because
in order to be able to really value

286
00:15:22,551 --> 00:15:26,420
your money over time, and you have to know
that you know how much money there is,

287
00:15:26,421 --> 00:15:26,601
right?

288
00:15:26,601 --> 00:15:30,230
You have to know that the money supply
is going to be a predictable increase.

289
00:15:30,500 --> 00:15:33,230
And then from that you can understand,
you know,

290
00:15:33,231 --> 00:15:34,760
how the economy is going to function.

291
00:15:35,300 --> 00:15:38,460
So here we can actually say this is how
gold production has worked over time,

292
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:41,120
where bitcoin production
has worked over time,

293
00:15:41,121 --> 00:15:46,121
where at the very beginning of time we
used to every 10 minutes on average about

294
00:15:46,281 --> 00:15:50,450
50 big ones. And then over time
the House that goes to 25 bitcoins,

295
00:15:50,451 --> 00:15:55,451
12.5 6.5 3.15 and so forth
until it finally evens out
that I'm 21 total million

296
00:15:57,291 --> 00:15:59,120
bitcoins. So you can compare
these two lines, right?

297
00:15:59,270 --> 00:16:01,190
This is how gold production
works every time.

298
00:16:01,460 --> 00:16:03,260
This is how bitcoin
production works over time.

299
00:16:03,261 --> 00:16:06,950
And the reality of bitcoin production
follows this curve. Exactly. Basically.

300
00:16:07,340 --> 00:16:11,180
And so how does this exactly work?
And um,

301
00:16:11,540 --> 00:16:15,440
feel free to jump into this if you want,
but um, yeah, basically long story short,

302
00:16:15,590 --> 00:16:19,340
Bitcoin was designed to be future proof
because it's governed just by code,

303
00:16:19,341 --> 00:16:23,660
right? And what we mean by that
is it is dictated that on average,

304
00:16:23,661 --> 00:16:27,650
one bitcoin that's going to be found
every 10 minutes or one on one block is

305
00:16:27,651 --> 00:16:28,610
going to be found every 10 minutes.

306
00:16:28,611 --> 00:16:31,900
And in that block there's a coin base
transaction in initial transaction that

307
00:16:31,910 --> 00:16:35,780
rewards this new 50 bitcoins are
25 bitcoins to 12.5 bitcoins.

308
00:16:35,930 --> 00:16:39,560
So how exactly does that work? Well,
basically in order to mine Bitcoin,

309
00:16:39,561 --> 00:16:41,570
I'm sure you guys have heard of
this term of mining bitcoin, right?

310
00:16:41,571 --> 00:16:43,550
It's an analog to
basically gold production,

311
00:16:43,700 --> 00:16:45,230
but in southern mining
it out of the ground,

312
00:16:45,231 --> 00:16:47,630
you're now mining it with a computer.
How do you mind that? If your computer,

313
00:16:47,810 --> 00:16:50,330
it uses a one way cryptographic
Hash function, right?

314
00:16:50,331 --> 00:16:54,870
And so it uses sh a to 56 which is
beautiful because the hash function is

315
00:16:54,871 --> 00:16:56,090
something that is one way,

316
00:16:56,091 --> 00:16:59,000
meaning that it's trivial for
you to calculate the output,

317
00:16:59,180 --> 00:17:02,840
but it's extremely difficult for you to
actually reverse engineer this, right?

318
00:17:02,841 --> 00:17:05,420
And find the input from the outlet,
which means I basically,

319
00:17:05,421 --> 00:17:06,860
you need to brute force this function.

320
00:17:07,040 --> 00:17:10,820
So in more technical terms specifically
where you're trying to do is you have a

321
00:17:10,821 --> 00:17:15,821
nonce and arbitrary increment number
that you basically have to run this

322
00:17:17,030 --> 00:17:18,830
function through this hash function,
right?

323
00:17:18,830 --> 00:17:23,420
So you're trying to find a output that
starts with a leading number of Zeros.

324
00:17:23,570 --> 00:17:27,830
And so the more zeroes that they,
this algorithm tells you that you need,

325
00:17:28,010 --> 00:17:29,900
the harder the problem is exponentially,
right?

326
00:17:30,440 --> 00:17:34,670
And so what it can do is it can adjust
to the difficulty of how many people were

327
00:17:34,671 --> 00:17:37,190
mining bitcoin at any given time.
So say at the very beginning,

328
00:17:37,191 --> 00:17:39,050
it was just a Toshi, right?
The Guy who made the coin,

329
00:17:39,260 --> 00:17:43,310
he's minding his laptop and he can
do maybe one hash per seconds, right?

330
00:17:43,330 --> 00:17:46,910
Of this algorithm, right? He
can calculate one Sha function.

331
00:17:46,911 --> 00:17:48,140
So he's going through this whole thing.

332
00:17:48,410 --> 00:17:51,240
So let's say he can do
60 hashes per minute,

333
00:17:51,630 --> 00:17:54,840
and that's 600 hashes
per every 10 minutes.

334
00:17:54,900 --> 00:17:58,740
So what would the bitcoin algorithm do?
It would say on average,

335
00:17:58,800 --> 00:18:00,540
you're going to find the
solution to this problem.

336
00:18:00,570 --> 00:18:02,400
Every one out of 600 of the tops,
right?

337
00:18:02,430 --> 00:18:06,210
It's going to make it as difficult as
one off 600 temps. So on the average,

338
00:18:06,211 --> 00:18:09,030
he'll find that every 10 minutes.
But now let's say ps two computers,

339
00:18:09,031 --> 00:18:11,280
there's someone else starts
mining bitcoin. What happens?

340
00:18:11,430 --> 00:18:14,670
Well now let's say they can both
mind that one has per second.

341
00:18:14,671 --> 00:18:17,760
So now they're doing 1200
hashes per every 10 minutes.

342
00:18:17,761 --> 00:18:20,970
So on theory you should see that they
would be finding a bit coin every five

343
00:18:20,971 --> 00:18:24,840
minutes, right? But what the bitcoin
algorithm can do is every 2016 blocks,

344
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:26,910
it readjusted difficulty.
So it's like, all right,

345
00:18:26,911 --> 00:18:29,190
how fast are we finding these bitcoins?

346
00:18:29,340 --> 00:18:32,830
Let's actually change this algorithm
such that now on average you find a bit

347
00:18:32,831 --> 00:18:37,080
coin every 1200 ashes as opposed
to 600 and so forth, right?

348
00:18:37,230 --> 00:18:40,550
And so this is extremely important because
it actually means that not only is it

349
00:18:40,551 --> 00:18:44,340
a future proof against many
people starting to mine bitcoin,

350
00:18:44,341 --> 00:18:47,070
but it's also future proof
against technology that
makes it much easier to mine

351
00:18:47,071 --> 00:18:50,340
bitcoin. So at the very beginning we
were using CPU is to mine bitcoin.

352
00:18:50,370 --> 00:18:51,690
That was not that efficient,
right?

353
00:18:51,691 --> 00:18:55,050
Then we move to gps because that can
paralyze the process much better.

354
00:18:55,170 --> 00:18:56,040
And that was a lot faster.

355
00:18:56,041 --> 00:18:59,910
But now we've actually progressed beyond
that to application specific integrated

356
00:18:59,911 --> 00:19:03,900
circuits [inaudible] that can mind bitcoin
because that is better than anything

357
00:19:03,901 --> 00:19:05,740
else because that's their
sole purpose in life, right?

358
00:19:05,790 --> 00:19:10,560
Is to solve this Saj two 56 hash function.
And if this was gold,

359
00:19:10,561 --> 00:19:13,320
right, we would be finding
bitcoins like every second. Right.

360
00:19:13,321 --> 00:19:16,350
As opposed to every time,
minutes, but it's not gold.

361
00:19:16,500 --> 00:19:20,130
And so it has adjusted perfectly
to the difficulty over time.

362
00:19:20,131 --> 00:19:24,960
And difficulty is like this absurd number
now. It's like, exactly. Yeah. But um,

363
00:19:25,110 --> 00:19:28,100
yeah. So let's, let's talk about some
other, but both at, so basically let's,

364
00:19:28,120 --> 00:19:31,080
if we were to compare the
coin and gold together,

365
00:19:31,560 --> 00:19:35,040
then this is the easiest way for me at
least to see what the value proposition

366
00:19:35,041 --> 00:19:36,060
of bitcoin is.

367
00:19:36,150 --> 00:19:40,800
So in one sense we have this currency
that has value because it's decentralized

368
00:19:40,801 --> 00:19:43,710
to gold is decentralized and trustless.
Right? You don't have to trust that.

369
00:19:43,711 --> 00:19:46,140
And part of the end, it's inherently
scarce. That's what gives it value.

370
00:19:46,141 --> 00:19:49,470
Because people trust. If I hold gold,
no one's going to inflate this thing.

371
00:19:49,770 --> 00:19:52,080
It's always going to retain value because
other people are gonna Trust at the

372
00:19:52,081 --> 00:19:54,870
same scarce. Bitcoin on the other
hand has all those same benefits,

373
00:19:54,871 --> 00:19:58,500
but ours even more predictable,
right? It's also decentralized.
No one controls it,

374
00:19:58,501 --> 00:19:59,760
right?
No Central Bank can be like,

375
00:19:59,761 --> 00:20:02,460
I'm going to print more bitcoins
because it's only by the code.

376
00:20:02,610 --> 00:20:04,890
And the code is actually very strongly,
uh,

377
00:20:04,920 --> 00:20:07,800
secured by this whole hashing algorithm,
right?

378
00:20:07,801 --> 00:20:10,330
All these miners are mining bitcoin.
Um,

379
00:20:10,500 --> 00:20:14,460
basically you would need at least 51%
of all the mining power in the world in

380
00:20:14,461 --> 00:20:17,520
order to actually attack
bitcoin and change it. And then,

381
00:20:17,521 --> 00:20:20,700
so there's some technicality there,
but I'm actually, I can get inside.

382
00:20:20,730 --> 00:20:22,680
So the technicality is very specifically,

383
00:20:23,550 --> 00:20:26,610
bitcoin holds the longest
chain to be the valid chain.

384
00:20:26,820 --> 00:20:31,820
And so whoever has the most hashing
power is more likely to find blocks then

385
00:20:32,100 --> 00:20:33,480
someone who has lost hashing power,
right?

386
00:20:33,481 --> 00:20:35,100
So if you have 60% of the hashing power,

387
00:20:35,250 --> 00:20:38,410
you're going to find blocks roughly
twice as fast as someone who has 30% of

388
00:20:38,411 --> 00:20:42,090
hashing power at least
until the difficulty just
right. And so in that case,

389
00:20:42,091 --> 00:20:45,210
if someone has 60% of the
hashing power, they could, um,

390
00:20:45,240 --> 00:20:48,580
basically control the chain and
they can decide which blocks, uh,

391
00:20:48,670 --> 00:20:50,370
include which transactions and so forth,
right?

392
00:20:50,380 --> 00:20:52,810
So that's why if you have
over 51% of the mind power,

393
00:20:52,811 --> 00:20:56,770
that's when it becomes directly possible.
It's a control bitcoin. But again,

394
00:20:56,860 --> 00:21:00,430
because everyone's rationally
self interested and trying
to get as much money as

395
00:21:00,431 --> 00:21:01,840
possible, there are a
lot of miners, right?

396
00:21:01,840 --> 00:21:04,840
And they're all basically fully
decentralized across the world.

397
00:21:04,841 --> 00:21:08,640
So it's very difficult for any one person
to get 51% of the power once bitcoin

398
00:21:08,650 --> 00:21:11,950
gets so large. And so,
again, bitcoin's very secure,

399
00:21:11,951 --> 00:21:15,160
very trust worthy because you don't
have to trust the central party.

400
00:21:15,161 --> 00:21:17,830
There's no central point of
failure and it's inherently scarce,

401
00:21:17,910 --> 00:21:19,330
but not only is inherently scarce,

402
00:21:19,450 --> 00:21:21,820
it's also inherently scarce
and very predictable fashion.

403
00:21:22,060 --> 00:21:25,900
So those are the benefits on top of gold.
But the other very important benefit,

404
00:21:25,901 --> 00:21:29,170
the one that Sitoshi really wants to
drill down in is that is an easily

405
00:21:29,171 --> 00:21:32,630
transactable currency. So you can go
around and like a pound of gold, right?

406
00:21:32,631 --> 00:21:33,431
And like shave off.

407
00:21:33,431 --> 00:21:36,850
Like it was small amounts to like pay
for coffee every day or like you know,

408
00:21:36,910 --> 00:21:40,510
your bus ticket and all that. People would
be like, what can I use this for? Right.

409
00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:44,020
And you really can't use gold that well.
In fact, it can only be used in person,

410
00:21:44,021 --> 00:21:47,490
right? You can't send it to someone in
China easily. You can't mail them goal.

411
00:21:47,491 --> 00:21:49,240
There's something about you could,
but it'd be terrible.

412
00:21:49,570 --> 00:21:53,030
But a big point on the other
hand is extremely trivial.

413
00:21:53,031 --> 00:21:56,380
Really easily transactable to
anyone in the world because it is,

414
00:21:57,280 --> 00:22:00,460
this is something that people say is
like a downside. A bitcoin, right?

415
00:22:00,461 --> 00:22:02,950
They don't understand that. Like
they're like, it's intangible, right?

416
00:22:02,951 --> 00:22:06,640
Like at least with gold, I can hold it
in my hand, right? Or paper, you know,

417
00:22:06,700 --> 00:22:09,310
like I can use this toilet paper
or kindling if I need it to. Right.

418
00:22:09,311 --> 00:22:10,720
There's like some tangible value to it.

419
00:22:11,260 --> 00:22:13,630
Bitcoin is this complete
intangible concept.

420
00:22:13,790 --> 00:22:15,550
Actually that's a strength of Bitcoin,
right?

421
00:22:15,551 --> 00:22:19,120
Because what it means is
that it's extremely easy to
transact in bitcoin across

422
00:22:19,121 --> 00:22:19,930
any border,
right?

423
00:22:19,930 --> 00:22:24,430
There's nothing but information
that constitutes the value
of bitcoin. Therefore,

424
00:22:24,431 --> 00:22:27,640
you can transfer it extremely well.
And so by its native state,

425
00:22:27,641 --> 00:22:29,260
it was designed such that,
you know,

426
00:22:29,290 --> 00:22:33,760
is as easy to send a transaction
for a cup of coffee, $3 right?

427
00:22:33,790 --> 00:22:37,000
Anywhere in the world locally or to
someone in China or to someone in the

428
00:22:37,001 --> 00:22:38,140
Philippines, right? You can buy a car,

429
00:22:38,141 --> 00:22:41,530
have it just as easily and justice
cheaply as you could buy a cup of coffee.

430
00:22:41,960 --> 00:22:45,940
So such very powerful. And then, um, yeah,

431
00:22:45,970 --> 00:22:49,960
and then so let's talk
about some hesitations that
people have and skepticisms

432
00:22:49,961 --> 00:22:54,040
that people have about bitcoin. And so the
one, the first one that they say, right,

433
00:22:54,041 --> 00:22:56,350
is that, you know, there's
no intrinsic value, right?

434
00:22:56,380 --> 00:22:58,450
There's nothing here that I
can hold in my hands, right?

435
00:22:58,720 --> 00:23:00,790
And so the counterpoints of that is,

436
00:23:00,940 --> 00:23:05,940
this is a point made by a sapiens actually
really well where money ultimately is

437
00:23:08,170 --> 00:23:12,880
just a denigration of the amount of trust
that people hold in that form of money.

438
00:23:12,970 --> 00:23:16,510
So what I mean by that is actually if you
look at gold, right? You can say, sure,

439
00:23:16,540 --> 00:23:20,170
gold has value because it can be
used as jewelry or it can be used for

440
00:23:20,171 --> 00:23:22,930
industrial purposes, right? We put it
in our laptops and things like that.

441
00:23:23,110 --> 00:23:27,880
But actually if you calculate the value
of goal today and how much of it is used

442
00:23:27,881 --> 00:23:29,140
for industry and jewelry,

443
00:23:29,290 --> 00:23:33,310
it's about 12% of the value of gold
is actually what's used for industry.

444
00:23:33,550 --> 00:23:37,870
The rest of it all, 88% of it comes
from thin air, basically. Right?

445
00:23:37,871 --> 00:23:40,180
Like what accounts for that
rest of the value? Well,

446
00:23:40,181 --> 00:23:42,940
that's actually just the trust that
people have in it as a currency,

447
00:23:42,941 --> 00:23:43,774
as a commodity,

448
00:23:43,840 --> 00:23:47,690
as opposed to the value of as a
jewelry or no industrial use case.

449
00:23:48,200 --> 00:23:50,780
Same for money today, right. You
say this thing has a physical,

450
00:23:50,781 --> 00:23:53,840
tangible like value, right? I
have a piece of paper in my hands,

451
00:23:54,080 --> 00:23:55,790
but actually how much
does it actually cost?

452
00:23:55,791 --> 00:23:57,290
What is the value of that piece of paper?

453
00:23:57,470 --> 00:24:00,950
It's about 5 cents for the government
to make a dollar bill. So what,

454
00:24:01,030 --> 00:24:04,910
where is that 95 cents a bike?
Uh, you know, value come from,

455
00:24:04,911 --> 00:24:07,430
it actually just comes from
trust in the u s dollar, right?

456
00:24:07,431 --> 00:24:11,270
And it comes from trust that this thing
has value. So ultimately in that sense,

457
00:24:11,390 --> 00:24:14,610
bitcoin can be seen as almost the most
pure form of money because there's

458
00:24:14,660 --> 00:24:17,270
nothing but trust, right?
And as abstract away,

459
00:24:17,271 --> 00:24:20,510
the need to have any tangible component
and there's just this intangible

460
00:24:20,511 --> 00:24:22,520
component of trust and that's
where it's value comes from.

461
00:24:22,760 --> 00:24:25,690
The other big question then skepticism
that people have about the coin,

462
00:24:25,700 --> 00:24:28,370
it's like what can you actually use it
for? Right? And so they're like, Yo,

463
00:24:28,371 --> 00:24:29,750
it's used for drug money,
right?

464
00:24:29,750 --> 00:24:32,480
It's like this illegal money
that people spend or you know,

465
00:24:32,481 --> 00:24:34,520
it's really just black market
stuff right now, right?

466
00:24:34,580 --> 00:24:37,340
Like no one's actually using it to
like pay their salaries in this stuff.

467
00:24:37,640 --> 00:24:42,140
And one that's actually changing
very quickly. But two, this is a,

468
00:24:42,920 --> 00:24:45,710
bitcoin is a nascent technology
that's just been formed, right?

469
00:24:45,711 --> 00:24:46,460
And it's something,

470
00:24:46,460 --> 00:24:50,900
this is a criticism that has been
lobbied time memorial to basically every

471
00:24:50,901 --> 00:24:53,450
single new technology is top
end, right? So this is a,

472
00:24:53,460 --> 00:24:55,040
this is one of the most
interesting articles though.

473
00:24:55,041 --> 00:24:58,820
It was a famous article back in 1995
by one of the first pioneers of the air

474
00:24:58,821 --> 00:25:02,270
that actually, and so he wrote this huge
thing on Newsweek. He's like, all right,

475
00:25:02,271 --> 00:25:04,160
everyone's like super excited
about the unit today, right?

476
00:25:04,161 --> 00:25:07,070
They think it's going to be like this
magical thing that's going to change

477
00:25:07,071 --> 00:25:08,330
everything about what we do.
Right?

478
00:25:08,570 --> 00:25:11,840
And like this is just all bullcrap
because like they talk about things like

479
00:25:11,841 --> 00:25:14,930
we're going to have libraries online,
we're going to have like town meetings,

480
00:25:14,931 --> 00:25:18,200
we're going to have commerce
and businesses going to
somehow shift from offices

481
00:25:18,201 --> 00:25:20,600
and malls, right. To
like the Internet. Right?

482
00:25:20,601 --> 00:25:23,870
And like we're going to have things
that like make government more like a

483
00:25:23,871 --> 00:25:27,890
democratic, like no. And then he's like,
this is just all totally false, right?

484
00:25:27,891 --> 00:25:32,810
Like no CD ROM or online databases can
like replace Your newspaper, right?

485
00:25:33,320 --> 00:25:35,730
Nothing like this is ever going to
happen to all that and fight they ass.

486
00:25:35,731 --> 00:25:36,531
These are totally right.

487
00:25:36,531 --> 00:25:39,650
He was absolutely correct back in 1995
none of these things were remotely

488
00:25:39,651 --> 00:25:40,430
possible,
right?

489
00:25:40,430 --> 00:25:43,280
There's all these like visions like
these far fetched plans that people had,

490
00:25:43,460 --> 00:25:46,460
but none that were possible then. But
all of these things have come true today,

491
00:25:46,490 --> 00:25:46,760
right?

492
00:25:46,760 --> 00:25:50,840
And so that's where it's interesting in
that like people who are focused on what

493
00:25:50,841 --> 00:25:55,640
bitcoin is today, I believe are taking it
from the wrong timescale, right? In fact,

494
00:25:55,670 --> 00:25:59,330
even if you were to take bitcoin and just
compare it today versus other forms of

495
00:25:59,331 --> 00:26:03,380
money, it's done incredibly well because
what gold has a 5,000 year headstart,

496
00:26:03,850 --> 00:26:06,050
u s dollars have a 300 year head start.

497
00:26:06,051 --> 00:26:09,650
If you were to compare them on the same
timescale, actually bitcoin, this one,

498
00:26:09,660 --> 00:26:12,320
the best performing currencies
and nine years, right?

499
00:26:12,321 --> 00:26:17,321
It's gone from basically nothing and value
to over $170 billion in value in just

500
00:26:17,601 --> 00:26:20,960
nine years. And it out to constant as
a currency. The U s currency, right.

501
00:26:21,170 --> 00:26:23,000
In nine years there was
actually hyper inflating,

502
00:26:23,001 --> 00:26:26,120
it was basically going down to zero at
the same time that bitcoin has retained

503
00:26:26,121 --> 00:26:28,520
its value in skyrocketed and
same thing of gold, right?

504
00:26:28,550 --> 00:26:33,310
Gold's value is about seven point $5
trillion for the total sum of all the gold

505
00:26:33,311 --> 00:26:35,900
that's ever been mined in the world.
Bitcoin 170,

506
00:26:36,140 --> 00:26:41,140
that's about one 40th the size of the
whole market value of gold and something

507
00:26:42,291 --> 00:26:43,980
like one,
2,500

508
00:26:44,010 --> 00:26:47,340
of the time. Right? Like took to
get to that value. So that's uh,

509
00:26:47,580 --> 00:26:51,330
that's the other point though is
interesting. So just really quickly, um,

510
00:26:51,660 --> 00:26:55,950
and this beer wanting to diamond a little
bit into some of the technical pieces

511
00:26:56,230 --> 00:26:57,610
because I think one thing
that's been engineers,

512
00:26:57,640 --> 00:27:00,360
like why is it this has been done
in the past. There have been,

513
00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:03,010
there have been currencies and other
things. Why haven't they worked? Um,

514
00:27:03,360 --> 00:27:05,970
I think one thing that's
really interesting is thinking
about actually what are

515
00:27:05,971 --> 00:27:08,540
the technological innovations within
bitcoin that has made this possible.

516
00:27:08,600 --> 00:27:09,570
Ben Thompson,
some of these,

517
00:27:09,870 --> 00:27:13,950
but one key problem that often comes
about is like there's the double spending

518
00:27:13,951 --> 00:27:16,440
problem. How do you ensure that, you know,

519
00:27:16,441 --> 00:27:17,970
money isn't sent to
two different accounts.

520
00:27:17,971 --> 00:27:21,960
How do you ensure like authenticity of
transactions and all these things and

521
00:27:21,961 --> 00:27:25,530
part of this kind of just comes down,
it's a very simple like cryptography,

522
00:27:25,531 --> 00:27:29,310
breakthroughs in cryptography in the way
that was manifest from the bitcoin was

523
00:27:29,340 --> 00:27:32,160
really, really profound. And it's a
specifically, right for those of you guys,

524
00:27:32,250 --> 00:27:33,740
how many of you guys actually own a big,

525
00:27:33,810 --> 00:27:37,290
like own some amount of cryptocurrency
or bitcoin? Just put quick show of hands.

526
00:27:37,740 --> 00:27:40,890
Alright, awesome. One of the things,
one of the most profound things for me,

527
00:27:40,891 --> 00:27:43,660
it was like, you know,
the first purchase of,

528
00:27:43,680 --> 00:27:46,140
of cryptocurrency and one of
course it's under an exchange,

529
00:27:46,141 --> 00:27:47,820
but then recognizing for example,

530
00:27:47,821 --> 00:27:50,930
public private key pair is like
what does that actually mean? Um,

531
00:27:51,030 --> 00:27:53,280
and I actually show of hands how
many people, how many people know,

532
00:27:53,340 --> 00:27:56,400
like your private key is, or a public
key is within the context. Yeah.

533
00:27:56,401 --> 00:28:00,390
A lot of you guys. Yeah, it's huge. Super,
super important. Um, decide, you know,

534
00:28:00,391 --> 00:28:02,500
this basically a way for
people to communicate and,

535
00:28:02,560 --> 00:28:06,270
and ensure the signature and the person
that is sending some message right is

536
00:28:06,271 --> 00:28:10,450
actually factually correct transactions.
Another really interesting idea,

537
00:28:10,451 --> 00:28:12,980
and this guy's actually goes
into the Eto blockchain, um,

538
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:17,520
in basically this idea that transactions
kind of point to the next transaction

539
00:28:17,521 --> 00:28:18,420
to the blockchain.

540
00:28:18,421 --> 00:28:21,660
You basically have a linked list of
different transactions that are coming in,

541
00:28:21,661 --> 00:28:25,680
right? That are overall being
mined as Ben said. Right?

542
00:28:25,681 --> 00:28:27,750
And then added basically to a note,
right?

543
00:28:27,751 --> 00:28:30,450
Like basically the mining
is calculating this cash id.

544
00:28:30,600 --> 00:28:33,810
You as a person send a transaction
that goes into a memory pool.

545
00:28:34,140 --> 00:28:36,210
All these transactions
are put into a block.

546
00:28:36,211 --> 00:28:37,770
That block is now appended to the node.

547
00:28:37,800 --> 00:28:40,890
That node is then broadcasted rate the
is and broadcast broadcasters to the rest

548
00:28:40,891 --> 00:28:42,420
of the network.
So this,

549
00:28:42,480 --> 00:28:46,080
in terms of some profound
realizations here,

550
00:28:46,590 --> 00:28:49,110
like bitcoin has this college,
like ultimately what are you trusting?

551
00:28:49,111 --> 00:28:50,850
What are you putting your faith in?

552
00:28:51,330 --> 00:28:54,450
It is that you have basically
this global ledger, right,

553
00:28:54,690 --> 00:28:58,890
of everything that is happening and
complete transparency to how the system

554
00:28:58,891 --> 00:29:01,980
works. You're not looking at a bank and
wondering how it's printing new money,

555
00:29:02,250 --> 00:29:03,360
how everything is happening.

556
00:29:03,600 --> 00:29:08,600
It's a completely clear and transparent
system enough that people can believe

557
00:29:09,031 --> 00:29:12,510
and trust that the system works.
Right. That's so far, yes,

558
00:29:12,511 --> 00:29:16,200
there are these clear technicalities
and points of vulnerability,

559
00:29:16,410 --> 00:29:19,770
but that a lot of that, right, we, in
terms of how we're moving forward, right,

560
00:29:19,830 --> 00:29:21,690
with skill,
um,

561
00:29:22,170 --> 00:29:24,990
to fact that you need to take 51% of
all the mining half hour to be able to

562
00:29:24,991 --> 00:29:27,390
actually conflict an attack. Like of
course there are all these problems,

563
00:29:27,391 --> 00:29:31,150
but at the same time there's an
enormous amount of technical, um,

564
00:29:31,290 --> 00:29:33,840
stepping that has been going forward
that has actually pushed a lot of

565
00:29:33,841 --> 00:29:37,050
blockchain and a lot of bitcoin right
now and will continue to in the future.

566
00:29:37,890 --> 00:29:41,980
So this also, now I'm brings
us to questions cause I know

567
00:29:41,980 --> 00:29:45,760
we covered a lot about bitcoin and money
and a lot of these pieces and we just

568
00:29:45,761 --> 00:29:48,580
want to take a really quick pulse to see
how people are feeling. Yeah. Question.

569
00:29:49,980 --> 00:29:53,260
Oh, sorry. Yeah, we'll, yeah, we'll repeat
the question every time. And it said, oh,

570
00:29:53,500 --> 00:29:54,880
great, awesome. Yeah. Question.

571
00:29:57,760 --> 00:30:02,760
The valuable relative to the intrinsic
value of Bitcoin in particular goal was

572
00:30:07,100 --> 00:30:10,860
for investment or it

573
00:30:13,490 --> 00:30:14,620
for investment purposes.

574
00:30:15,650 --> 00:30:19,190
The demand for billing for industrial
purposes is very less, right?

575
00:30:19,191 --> 00:30:21,970
So if the price of gold
course started dropping,

576
00:30:22,300 --> 00:30:26,850
the usage of gold skyrocket.
Absolutely. Yup. They did

577
00:30:28,550 --> 00:30:33,550
that 12% of industrial use because it's
elastic means that it's going to act as

578
00:30:36,141 --> 00:30:40,290
a dampener on the other 80%
of the speculative value. Yep.

579
00:30:41,360 --> 00:30:46,130
Yes. John, just to quickly clarify, it
was, that was, that was a long one. Okay,

580
00:30:46,131 --> 00:30:49,730
so just real quick rephrasing the
question. Ben Talks about gold,

581
00:30:49,790 --> 00:30:54,050
12% being right, it's kind of industrial
purpose serves as a dampening effect.

582
00:30:54,230 --> 00:30:55,870
How does that factor in like absolutely.
Great question.

583
00:30:55,890 --> 00:30:58,850
We're talking about the elasticity of
gold. Exactly. Yeah, so that's beautiful.

584
00:30:58,851 --> 00:30:59,990
And again,

585
00:31:00,040 --> 00:31:03,740
anything that you guys saw that I said
that you guys have skepticism about,

586
00:31:03,770 --> 00:31:05,240
that's where we want to
talk with right now. Right?

587
00:31:05,241 --> 00:31:08,150
Because that's a Penn south
question because what that
means is that's basically

588
00:31:08,151 --> 00:31:10,190
the transactional base for gold,
right?

589
00:31:10,220 --> 00:31:13,790
It means that even if we wiped out
all of the value of currency, uh,

590
00:31:13,850 --> 00:31:17,150
that gold has is a commodity or a currency
or like spectrum of value or anything

591
00:31:17,151 --> 00:31:20,660
like that. There would be some use case
as industry. And you're right, right?

592
00:31:20,660 --> 00:31:24,470
Like that mountain would go
up as the price of gold fell.

593
00:31:24,530 --> 00:31:27,860
So it would provide a base value, right?
Well actually that base values, I'm just,

594
00:31:27,861 --> 00:31:30,770
the thing that you were the abstract away
from like the rest of that currency's

595
00:31:30,771 --> 00:31:31,071
value.

596
00:31:31,071 --> 00:31:34,490
So what I mean by that is like let's say
what is that wants to see proof point.

597
00:31:34,670 --> 00:31:39,670
So [inaudible] Gold's industrial value
is $1 trillion or something like that.

598
00:31:39,681 --> 00:31:44,681
Right now I'm like f f everything else
was removed from no one trusted as a

599
00:31:45,861 --> 00:31:46,161
currency.

600
00:31:46,161 --> 00:31:50,180
It was only used for those industrial
purposes and that would be basically the

601
00:31:50,181 --> 00:31:52,610
entirety of that economy,
right? There's like no. So

602
00:31:55,280 --> 00:31:58,250
supply and demand is going to dictate the,
as the value drops,

603
00:31:58,580 --> 00:32:01,520
you're going to have more industrial
uses. Absolutely. But there's a,

604
00:32:01,521 --> 00:32:03,560
there's a cap on the market
cap of all that gold.

605
00:32:03,590 --> 00:32:05,090
It's how much people are
willing to pay for it.

606
00:32:05,240 --> 00:32:06,350
And so that would be at some point,

607
00:32:06,351 --> 00:32:08,720
right there will be certainly lower
than seven point 5 trillion today.

608
00:32:09,110 --> 00:32:11,030
So like for example,

609
00:32:11,031 --> 00:32:14,180
I'm saying like how much does everyone
in the industry willing to pay for those

610
00:32:14,181 --> 00:32:15,980
industrial use case of gold?
You're absolutely right,

611
00:32:15,981 --> 00:32:17,840
but they were consumed all
the gold available, right?

612
00:32:17,990 --> 00:32:19,730
They would certainly
consume all the supply,

613
00:32:19,910 --> 00:32:23,540
but they wouldn't actually pay seven
point $5 trillion for it. Right.

614
00:32:23,660 --> 00:32:26,390
They would pay some fraction of
that price. Does that make sense?

615
00:32:26,780 --> 00:32:28,550
Like you're saying it's elastic,
right?

616
00:32:28,570 --> 00:32:30,650
So they'll pay maybe half
the price of gold today,

617
00:32:30,651 --> 00:32:33,170
they'll consume twice as much
gold, right? At half the price.

618
00:32:33,380 --> 00:32:37,730
Is that what you mean by the
loss of sea? Correct. Yup.

619
00:32:37,970 --> 00:32:41,790
Basically my is that even if everyone
today decided that, you know, oh,

620
00:32:41,791 --> 00:32:43,160
I don't want to store my goal.
Absolutely.

621
00:32:43,550 --> 00:32:48,400
It's not going to lose 80% of its value.
It's going to lose. Yup. Exactly. Yeah,

622
00:32:48,590 --> 00:32:53,260
yeah, yeah. So to be specific, right?
It's like if the price goes down,

623
00:32:53,270 --> 00:32:55,790
they're being consumed more gold, but
they're going to be paying less for it,

624
00:32:55,791 --> 00:32:57,680
right? So that the market
cap is still dropping, right?

625
00:32:57,920 --> 00:33:01,610
So because like if you're consuming
twice as much gold at half the price,

626
00:33:01,611 --> 00:33:03,950
then you're still actually contributing
to the same market cap, right?

627
00:33:04,280 --> 00:33:06,830
So that's basically what I'm saying is
that like, yeah, you're absolutely right.

628
00:33:06,980 --> 00:33:07,850
It wouldn't drop all the way,

629
00:33:07,851 --> 00:33:11,300
but that actually probably would
be somewhere in between. You know,

630
00:33:11,450 --> 00:33:14,210
what they're paying for goal today
and we're gold as day, right?

631
00:33:14,211 --> 00:33:16,130
So as certainly what drop,
but then again,

632
00:33:16,131 --> 00:33:19,050
what we're focused on is
that difference in that, um,

633
00:33:19,580 --> 00:33:22,840
the difference between all the money that,
um,

634
00:33:23,090 --> 00:33:26,900
industry would pay for gold and
we're gold's prices today, right?

635
00:33:26,990 --> 00:33:30,140
And so that's basically,
there is certainly some
difference there, but even so,

636
00:33:30,141 --> 00:33:32,270
right? Like you could actually make
that same argument from Bitcoin, right?

637
00:33:32,271 --> 00:33:35,810
There are actually transactional use cases
for Bitcoin, for example, you can say,

638
00:33:36,010 --> 00:33:38,170
um, there is western
union, right? It basically,

639
00:33:38,180 --> 00:33:40,940
eclipse is western union and
all of those payment purposes.

640
00:33:40,941 --> 00:33:44,750
So Western Union is about the $10
billion currency a company today, right?

641
00:33:44,780 --> 00:33:49,780
There's about $10 billion of value and
money transaction between people in the

642
00:33:49,791 --> 00:33:51,710
states and like people in
the Philippines and so forth,

643
00:33:51,711 --> 00:33:55,130
right in bitcoin actually has that same
kind of industrial use case, right?

644
00:33:55,131 --> 00:33:59,960
And there are a lot of other use cases
that are coming out over time. So yeah,

645
00:33:59,990 --> 00:34:02,600
um, basically the, there
is certainly value there.

646
00:34:02,601 --> 00:34:05,720
What we're trying to segment the way is
that there are many different ways to

647
00:34:05,721 --> 00:34:09,830
value what bitcoin is worth.
Gold is only one of those value cases.

648
00:34:09,980 --> 00:34:11,850
And specifically when I talk about gold,
again,

649
00:34:11,851 --> 00:34:14,940
there was just about the difference
in that industrial value abstracting

650
00:34:14,950 --> 00:34:18,710
Galloway and then the remainder of
the value over time. And so, um,

651
00:34:18,740 --> 00:34:21,320
you're right that there are like other
things that contribute to the price of

652
00:34:21,321 --> 00:34:23,530
gold or a big one. And in fact, um,

653
00:34:23,600 --> 00:34:25,780
this goes into something that we're
going to talk about later is a,

654
00:34:25,860 --> 00:34:29,690
there are a lot of applications I can
build on top of bitcoin that contribute to

655
00:34:29,691 --> 00:34:32,480
value beyond that just being
currency, right? But being a currency.

656
00:34:32,630 --> 00:34:36,110
And the value that people hold it as a
currency is just one facet of all the

657
00:34:36,111 --> 00:34:38,570
different reasons that bitcoin
will not value. So that's, yeah,

658
00:34:38,670 --> 00:34:39,360
that's a good point.
We'll take,

659
00:34:39,360 --> 00:34:42,620
we'll take questions just in the interest
of time. We have till 1:00 PM. So we'll,

660
00:34:42,621 --> 00:34:44,050
we'll,
we'll now just batch all,

661
00:34:44,150 --> 00:34:45,580
all the questions till the
end so we can cover it.

662
00:34:45,590 --> 00:34:47,210
Some of the rest of this
stuff. Well, let's see.

663
00:34:47,211 --> 00:34:51,230
Maybe we don't wonder if be
that great. It's 1240. Yeah.
Awesome. Cool, cool. Oh Wow.

664
00:34:51,290 --> 00:34:52,123
That's fast

665
00:34:56,900 --> 00:34:57,733
test.

666
00:34:57,770 --> 00:35:01,030
Uh, so, uh, thanks. I think, um,

667
00:35:01,160 --> 00:35:06,160
your explanation of why a bitcoin is
superior to US dollars or a gold was

668
00:35:07,790 --> 00:35:08,331
fantastic.

669
00:35:08,331 --> 00:35:12,970
The one like a question I have is
about kind of the volatility of like,

670
00:35:14,380 --> 00:35:16,010
um,
so like if a,

671
00:35:16,330 --> 00:35:19,940
a bank run or something like that can
really affect the value of US dollar.

672
00:35:19,970 --> 00:35:23,450
It seems like there's a lot of events
that could also similarly affect the value

673
00:35:23,480 --> 00:35:27,110
of a bitcoin, like a different governments
making regulations about it, et Cetera.

674
00:35:27,500 --> 00:35:30,740
And just like looking at the price of
Bitcoin, it's always fluctuating wildly.

675
00:35:30,950 --> 00:35:31,820
So how can it be a,

676
00:35:32,060 --> 00:35:35,960
how can it be used as a useful form
of currency with that being the case?

677
00:35:36,140 --> 00:35:36,980
That's a perfect question.

678
00:35:37,380 --> 00:35:39,180
So there are a lot of things
there that you're talking about.

679
00:35:39,210 --> 00:35:43,860
So one is like a yeah, f like a currency
is a measure of it's trust, right?

680
00:35:43,861 --> 00:35:46,470
Then there are certainly things I can
demean that trust over time or damage that

681
00:35:46,471 --> 00:35:49,770
trust. And you're exactly right. Like
say the u s is like, wait a minute,

682
00:35:49,800 --> 00:35:53,130
why do we want people to use bitcoin
over the U s dollar? Let's ban bitcoin.

683
00:35:53,310 --> 00:35:54,180
And they actually can write,

684
00:35:54,181 --> 00:35:56,370
there's central points of
vulnerability they could ban exchanges.

685
00:35:56,520 --> 00:36:01,050
So the question again is, um, what happens
with the volatility of Bitcoin, right?

686
00:36:01,051 --> 00:36:02,420
It's like, um, how,

687
00:36:02,440 --> 00:36:05,760
how can you have a currency that people
trust that people want to use as a

688
00:36:05,761 --> 00:36:07,650
global digital daily currency?

689
00:36:07,830 --> 00:36:10,650
F They can't believe that's gonna
hold its value while, right?

690
00:36:10,651 --> 00:36:12,660
Because it keeps going up or it
keeps going down and so forth.

691
00:36:12,930 --> 00:36:14,970
And so there are two,
two ways to answer that question.

692
00:36:14,971 --> 00:36:18,960
One actually you can see the volatility
is something that has been decreasing

693
00:36:18,961 --> 00:36:23,340
dramatically over time. So right now we
see swings maybe at most about 20%. Right?

694
00:36:23,580 --> 00:36:27,430
But that, that is massive compared to
like most currencies. But actually over,

695
00:36:27,431 --> 00:36:28,790
it's like at the very beginning,
right?

696
00:36:28,810 --> 00:36:32,340
You could see bitcoin dropped
from like $30 down to $2. Right?

697
00:36:32,341 --> 00:36:34,200
Or like a dollar down to like two sons.

698
00:36:34,470 --> 00:36:37,980
And so actually right now the volatility
that we see in system is far less than

699
00:36:37,981 --> 00:36:38,814
it was before.

700
00:36:38,820 --> 00:36:42,120
And this will only continue to decrease
over time as it gains more adoption.

701
00:36:42,121 --> 00:36:46,350
Right? It's just a function
of like a small cap versus
a large cap. And so that's,

702
00:36:46,380 --> 00:36:48,300
that's one part of it.
The other part of it though is a,

703
00:36:48,310 --> 00:36:51,660
is a really good question that like,
um, a lot of people do say even,

704
00:36:51,661 --> 00:36:54,300
so even if you have a currency that,
um,

705
00:36:55,050 --> 00:36:58,860
is just appreciating or like a, the
volatility isn't going down. Um,

706
00:36:58,940 --> 00:37:02,640
a deflationary currency over time is
like a, a bit of a problem as well,

707
00:37:02,940 --> 00:37:06,300
that people are encouraged to keep
their money as supposed to spend it.

708
00:37:06,301 --> 00:37:07,590
And there's some questions there,

709
00:37:07,710 --> 00:37:10,680
but then price stability and of
itself is a valuable thing, right?

710
00:37:10,681 --> 00:37:14,220
Like you can't say one that cup of
coffee is one bitcoin today because in 10

711
00:37:14,221 --> 00:37:17,860
years is going to be like $17,000 and
you're like, wow, that sucks. Right? Um,

712
00:37:18,300 --> 00:37:21,270
but what is interesting
is that are actually some
solutions around this, right?

713
00:37:21,271 --> 00:37:24,750
So how the US government does it is they
have central bank and the central bank

714
00:37:24,751 --> 00:37:28,500
makes sure that the money always
in plates at like two or 3% a year,

715
00:37:28,560 --> 00:37:29,940
no matter what happens to the economy,
right?

716
00:37:29,941 --> 00:37:31,230
And they can do this through two things.

717
00:37:31,320 --> 00:37:33,660
They can inflate the money supply when
there's more demand for it, right?

718
00:37:33,660 --> 00:37:36,960
So when more people have trust in the
US dollar, they just print more money.

719
00:37:36,961 --> 00:37:39,860
They print like a billion new dollars
and they can actually capture that money

720
00:37:39,890 --> 00:37:40,561
themselves,
right?

721
00:37:40,561 --> 00:37:42,900
That's real money that the Princeton
about dilutes hunger with loss, right?

722
00:37:42,910 --> 00:37:46,140
So that puts the money, the value of
the US dollar down. And in the reverse,

723
00:37:46,141 --> 00:37:48,540
what they can do is they can actually
issue bonds rates to constrict the money

724
00:37:48,541 --> 00:37:52,860
supply. So when people lose trust in
the US dollar is starting to lose money.

725
00:37:52,980 --> 00:37:54,870
What they do is they
issue bonds at a yield.

726
00:37:54,960 --> 00:37:58,020
And what that does is it reduces the
amount of money and the system thereby

727
00:37:58,021 --> 00:38:00,060
driving up the price of each us dollar.

728
00:38:00,150 --> 00:38:02,580
And actually you can do
this in the world today too.

729
00:38:02,581 --> 00:38:04,530
So there's an extremely interesting
currency that's coming out.

730
00:38:04,531 --> 00:38:08,160
It's called base coin and they do exactly
that's there an algorithmic central

731
00:38:08,161 --> 00:38:12,360
bank. So what that means is they
basically buy their algorithm,

732
00:38:12,361 --> 00:38:15,720
not through a normal central bank
that's controlled by like five people.

733
00:38:15,870 --> 00:38:18,810
They are able to say f
the money supply grows,

734
00:38:18,930 --> 00:38:23,010
you're able to print more money to
dilute the my supplies such as the prices

735
00:38:23,011 --> 00:38:26,280
have remained stable.
And in the case that the money supply,

736
00:38:26,670 --> 00:38:29,010
people are losing faith in this thing
and they're selling their base coin,

737
00:38:29,250 --> 00:38:32,370
they can actually issue bonds the
redeemed in chronological order with

738
00:38:32,371 --> 00:38:34,350
increasing yields such that you know,

739
00:38:34,560 --> 00:38:39,520
f you at any point believe that base coin
will remain that's retained its value

740
00:38:39,521 --> 00:38:42,550
and like go back to the
$1, you know, stable value,

741
00:38:42,640 --> 00:38:46,300
then you would be extremely rationally
motivated that's buy these bonds because

742
00:38:46,301 --> 00:38:49,030
you'll get free yield on it,
right when the price goes back,

743
00:38:49,031 --> 00:38:53,180
when the trust is remain a retained
again in the future you'll just get about

744
00:38:53,190 --> 00:38:56,140
10% more bass coins or something
like that. So that's actually,

745
00:38:56,190 --> 00:38:59,440
it's very important to find a
system that has priced stability,

746
00:38:59,650 --> 00:39:02,170
but at the same time you want to capture
the value from the growth of that

747
00:39:02,171 --> 00:39:02,981
currency over time.
Right?

748
00:39:02,981 --> 00:39:06,790
So these are like two different
things that we're trying to do and the

749
00:39:06,791 --> 00:39:08,680
government does this by just saying,
don't worry about it.

750
00:39:08,681 --> 00:39:10,930
We'll take all the money and you guys
don't have to worry about this value.

751
00:39:10,931 --> 00:39:12,820
That's appreciated, right?
We'll just capture ourselves.

752
00:39:13,090 --> 00:39:15,460
But ideally you would like to
capture value yourself, right?

753
00:39:15,461 --> 00:39:19,570
Like you want your bitcoins to go from
$5 today to $17,000 right in the future,

754
00:39:19,660 --> 00:39:22,120
but you also want to be able to
price things in this currency. Well,

755
00:39:22,121 --> 00:39:26,050
how do you solve that one said, well,
you can have a system where you can say,

756
00:39:26,051 --> 00:39:27,550
for example,
this is,

757
00:39:27,700 --> 00:39:31,390
this cup of coffee is three bitcoins and
three bitcoins are always a dollar and

758
00:39:31,391 --> 00:39:35,410
in five years instead you still have,
uh,

759
00:39:35,440 --> 00:39:38,190
all the value that came from the
growth of that currency. Instead,

760
00:39:38,200 --> 00:39:41,890
what you have now is it's still three
bitcoins is still worth $3, right?

761
00:39:41,891 --> 00:39:45,020
Each bitcoin still worth a
dollar each in five years inside.

762
00:39:45,040 --> 00:39:48,310
Now you just have 17,000 bitcoins that
are all worth a dollar each, right?

763
00:39:48,430 --> 00:39:51,520
So that's an interesting system where
you can have price stability but also

764
00:39:51,521 --> 00:39:55,270
still capture value from the growth of
the currency over time. So Yup. Yup.

765
00:39:55,271 --> 00:39:56,200
And so forth.
So yeah.

766
00:39:56,201 --> 00:40:00,610
So now basically when we'll jump into
is some of the most promising future

767
00:40:00,611 --> 00:40:03,250
applications of bitcoin and
blockchain technology to,

768
00:40:03,490 --> 00:40:06,420
so what we've seen in the past.
Yes. These really exciting. Yeah.

769
00:40:06,540 --> 00:40:07,770
And I know we're running short on time,

770
00:40:07,771 --> 00:40:10,660
so really quickly just for theory
and also gets into into some really,

771
00:40:10,661 --> 00:40:14,740
really interesting pieces. Turing
complete language, amazing in that,

772
00:40:14,860 --> 00:40:17,530
that actually for those of you
guys that know what I mean,

773
00:40:17,531 --> 00:40:21,460
like a theory of high,
they EVM,

774
00:40:21,490 --> 00:40:25,360
we're just trading Turing complete
allows the creation of basically, right.

775
00:40:25,570 --> 00:40:27,940
Anything that you could
potentially coat up, right?

776
00:40:27,970 --> 00:40:31,900
Like in any sort of language you can
actually translate into a Theorem,

777
00:40:31,901 --> 00:40:34,570
which is one of the
coolest things from my end.

778
00:40:34,571 --> 00:40:38,560
Viping cause now you can actually have
complex interactions that middleman right

779
00:40:38,561 --> 00:40:42,910
in market makers are 10 tend to perform
right now actually be able to be

780
00:40:42,911 --> 00:40:44,830
codafide into smart contracts.
Right.

781
00:40:44,860 --> 00:40:48,790
And then actually be implemented on the
network with some financial base, um,

782
00:40:48,791 --> 00:40:51,190
at the back of it.
So I think we'll just,

783
00:40:51,220 --> 00:40:52,660
we'll skip through this
because I knew we were running.

784
00:40:52,780 --> 00:40:54,580
So I'll give a quick example of like the,

785
00:40:54,581 --> 00:40:58,540
the future potential of what smart
contracts can do. So for example,

786
00:40:58,720 --> 00:41:02,260
basically what bitcoin has done this,
it's disintermediate this middleman,

787
00:41:02,290 --> 00:41:02,951
the government,
right?

788
00:41:02,951 --> 00:41:05,890
The government was what you needed to
trust before as a third party that could

789
00:41:05,891 --> 00:41:07,270
control and create your money.

790
00:41:07,300 --> 00:41:10,030
And you gave them trust because they're
trustworthy and they're the only person

791
00:41:10,031 --> 00:41:12,370
who can be trustworthy.
But now in fact, you,

792
00:41:12,371 --> 00:41:15,220
anyone can create their own currency
and people can trust it because you know

793
00:41:15,221 --> 00:41:18,670
that like it will be to by this
code, right? That's exciting.

794
00:41:18,671 --> 00:41:22,060
But actually what's more exciting is that
you can actually do this with any kind

795
00:41:22,061 --> 00:41:24,970
of industry, right? So you can do the same
thing. For example, if the legal system,

796
00:41:25,120 --> 00:41:29,050
so a smart contract is just a piece
of code that dictates what happens.

797
00:41:29,080 --> 00:41:31,270
But like on top of it, you know,
there's some currency aspect.

798
00:41:31,360 --> 00:41:32,470
So let's take an example.

799
00:41:32,471 --> 00:41:36,470
Say you want to make a bet
with some random person that
Donald Trump will remain

800
00:41:36,471 --> 00:41:39,770
present, not the end of 2018 right?
And so today, if you were to say,

801
00:41:39,771 --> 00:41:41,270
let's do this a hundred dollars bet,
right?

802
00:41:41,420 --> 00:41:43,460
And if you did it with
complete random stranger,

803
00:41:43,461 --> 00:41:47,540
you wouldn't because you'd have to trust
that they would like honor this, right?

804
00:41:47,540 --> 00:41:48,980
And so in today's world,
right,

805
00:41:49,100 --> 00:41:52,160
let's say even if you have
a written contract with this
random person and you're

806
00:41:52,161 --> 00:41:52,640
like,
all right,

807
00:41:52,640 --> 00:41:55,670
we'll pay each other a hundred dollars
based on who wins this fat, right?

808
00:41:55,671 --> 00:41:58,190
I think that Donald Trump will be
president. You think that they won't.

809
00:41:58,400 --> 00:42:00,950
And then at the end of that time say, I'm
right, right? And that person's like, oh,

810
00:42:00,951 --> 00:42:03,020
nevermind. I don't want pay
you. Well, what's your recourse?

811
00:42:03,200 --> 00:42:04,700
You'd have to go through the legal system,
right?

812
00:42:04,701 --> 00:42:08,030
And like the cost and the time of
going through the legal system,

813
00:42:08,031 --> 00:42:11,870
which is this extremely inefficient kind
of middleman that arbitrates all these

814
00:42:11,990 --> 00:42:15,530
discussions today is something that
would almost certainly be more than like

815
00:42:15,531 --> 00:42:16,364
this a hundred dollar battery.

816
00:42:16,370 --> 00:42:18,530
So it would never be worthwhile
for you to go through our system,

817
00:42:18,740 --> 00:42:20,960
therefore you will never be able
to make a bet like this, right?

818
00:42:20,960 --> 00:42:24,920
So there's huge inefficiency that reduces
the ability for us to have all these

819
00:42:24,921 --> 00:42:27,920
economic transactions, right?
In fact, with a smart contract,

820
00:42:27,921 --> 00:42:29,510
we can completely obviate that system,
right?

821
00:42:29,511 --> 00:42:32,780
We can abstract the way the need to
trust this third party to make a bet like

822
00:42:32,781 --> 00:42:34,820
this. In fact, we don't have to
trust the other part of the law.

823
00:42:34,821 --> 00:42:35,690
We don't have to know them.

824
00:42:35,840 --> 00:42:38,330
They could be some random person on the
internet and we would say, all right,

825
00:42:38,331 --> 00:42:39,950
Alison, bomb. They want to make this bet.

826
00:42:40,070 --> 00:42:42,290
So both of them agreed
to the smart contract,

827
00:42:42,291 --> 00:42:45,290
they put their money into the smart
contract, it goes into escrow, right?

828
00:42:45,291 --> 00:42:49,250
So now the smart contract holds $200
and then at the end of 2018 the smart

829
00:42:49,251 --> 00:42:51,320
contract can ping an
oracle or source of truth,

830
00:42:51,470 --> 00:42:54,860
or there's a game directly secure way
for you to actually have an economic like

831
00:42:55,070 --> 00:42:58,190
incentive for people to tell you the
truth. And then at the end of that time,

832
00:42:58,191 --> 00:43:01,940
it just says, all right, Alice won the
bet. We send all $200 to Alice, right?

833
00:43:01,970 --> 00:43:05,300
So now you can see that you can actually
have really interesting things where

834
00:43:05,301 --> 00:43:09,230
you reduce a lot of inefficiency and you
reduce the need for a middleman to make

835
00:43:09,231 --> 00:43:13,520
all these kinds of applications
possible. Yup. Yeah, exactly. Well said.

836
00:43:14,330 --> 00:43:14,660
Sarah.

837
00:43:14,660 --> 00:43:19,100
Fundamental value proposition
is abstracting the need
like to trust and depend

838
00:43:19,101 --> 00:43:21,560
on any given middleman.
And that's like, you know,

839
00:43:21,620 --> 00:43:23,300
a lot of the core value proposition.
For example,

840
00:43:23,360 --> 00:43:25,580
if I'm in a lot of the d applications,

841
00:43:25,581 --> 00:43:29,570
so d apps that are being developed
on top of the Theorem is that you now

842
00:43:29,571 --> 00:43:32,510
basically have this currency right
in which, right? For example,

843
00:43:32,511 --> 00:43:37,511
the code and ether specifically as a
currency is being used to actually run the

844
00:43:38,751 --> 00:43:40,730
logic within the code,
right? They were just like,

845
00:43:40,731 --> 00:43:45,320
one of the coolest like paradigms is
this idea of a world computer, right?

846
00:43:45,380 --> 00:43:49,680
That is now decentralized, transparent
in terms of how it functions, um,

847
00:43:49,730 --> 00:43:53,180
and allowing people to write
these functionalities functions,

848
00:43:53,240 --> 00:43:54,960
these applications in the same way.
For example,

849
00:43:54,961 --> 00:43:57,050
on top of the Internet there are
websites and other things created.

850
00:43:57,051 --> 00:44:00,470
So this flow information and
this flow of logic in particular,

851
00:44:00,500 --> 00:44:03,980
this is actually my first foray into
cryptocurrency was a theory because it was

852
00:44:03,981 --> 00:44:06,060
so exciting from a technical perspective.
Um,

853
00:44:06,120 --> 00:44:09,530
and see if we actually think about
this in down the line, right?

854
00:44:09,531 --> 00:44:14,070
We have blockchain, we are actually in
code complex pieces of logic, right?

855
00:44:14,390 --> 00:44:17,630
In some sort of right way through
solidity and through smart contracts.

856
00:44:17,870 --> 00:44:21,250
I'm actually able to exit a lot of this
stuff. What can we do with that, you know,

857
00:44:21,320 --> 00:44:22,131
as a result.
Right?

858
00:44:22,131 --> 00:44:25,130
And I think for those of you have been
following with the ICO space and a lot of

859
00:44:25,131 --> 00:44:28,040
crypto projects, um, this
actually opens up some really,

860
00:44:28,041 --> 00:44:31,170
really interesting doors in terms of what
people can do on top of something like

861
00:44:31,171 --> 00:44:32,340
a ethereum during Erc

862
00:44:32,340 --> 00:44:33,091
20 token rate,

863
00:44:33,091 --> 00:44:36,540
which is like kind of the standard in
terms of tokens that are built on top of

864
00:44:36,541 --> 00:44:40,350
the ethereum chain. So using the theory
on blockchain to, to exit specific things,

865
00:44:40,620 --> 00:44:43,170
um, as well as like, you
know, other doctrines that
have come. So in particular,

866
00:44:43,171 --> 00:44:46,680
what we're going to do is actually take
stream what we're working on, um, as a,

867
00:44:46,681 --> 00:44:48,260
as a somewhat of a case studies terms,

868
00:44:48,280 --> 00:44:51,080
thinking about actual value accrued
in a lot of these crypto parties.

869
00:44:51,240 --> 00:44:52,590
So we were going to get
to their questions too.

870
00:44:52,591 --> 00:44:56,780
So I'm going to actually just do a very
quick explanation of all the things that

871
00:44:56,781 --> 00:44:59,880
are relevant in like what
is an exciting use of, uh,

872
00:45:00,090 --> 00:45:02,400
watching technology that
we see. And then, you know,

873
00:45:02,401 --> 00:45:05,010
if you guys want to learn
more about anything, just
less less, no one questions,

874
00:45:05,011 --> 00:45:06,360
you guys have some very specifically,

875
00:45:06,361 --> 00:45:10,440
what's the fascinating thing now is we
basically democratize the creation of

876
00:45:10,441 --> 00:45:12,570
money, right? There's no
longer a domain of a monopoly.

877
00:45:12,571 --> 00:45:16,290
So specifically the monopolies I could
before create money or governments, right?

878
00:45:16,291 --> 00:45:20,370
They're the only ones who had the trust
that people would place to be able to

879
00:45:20,371 --> 00:45:22,890
create money. Now anyone can do it.
So what can you do with that? Well,

880
00:45:22,920 --> 00:45:26,160
you can actually do things, for example,
like make sector specific currencies.

881
00:45:26,280 --> 00:45:27,690
What's extremely interesting about that.

882
00:45:27,691 --> 00:45:31,800
And what I mean by that is a currency
that specifically just tracks one industry

883
00:45:31,830 --> 00:45:34,500
or one sector or one economy.
For example, in our case,

884
00:45:34,501 --> 00:45:37,050
we're tracking video streaming
or content distribution. Well,

885
00:45:37,051 --> 00:45:39,660
what can you do in that case, what you
can do to extremely interesting things.

886
00:45:39,930 --> 00:45:43,770
One, you can shield that currency
from global volatility. So right now,

887
00:45:43,771 --> 00:45:44,221
for example,

888
00:45:44,221 --> 00:45:48,390
there are many different factors that
impact the price of a US dollar, right?

889
00:45:48,391 --> 00:45:51,630
Maybe oil prices fall somewhere in the
world, or like they rise or something.

890
00:45:51,780 --> 00:45:54,870
And like that impacts you even if you
have nothing to do with oil, right?

891
00:45:54,900 --> 00:45:57,540
Even if you have nothing to do with the
economic policy of the government and so

892
00:45:57,541 --> 00:46:00,450
forth, right? You're in like, you're just
like a video maker, right? They're like,

893
00:46:00,451 --> 00:46:04,350
why am I being impacted by this? We'll
actually, no, you don't have to be, right?

894
00:46:04,351 --> 00:46:08,670
You can have a currency that specifically
is valued based on that's use case in

895
00:46:08,671 --> 00:46:12,780
a specific industry such that the other
fascinating thing that happens here is

896
00:46:12,781 --> 00:46:16,800
you have incentive alignment within
this industry where we can create strong

897
00:46:16,950 --> 00:46:21,150
motivations to, uh, create a virtuous
cycle of increasing network effects.

898
00:46:21,690 --> 00:46:23,220
And so what I mean by that is no,

899
00:46:23,610 --> 00:46:26,970
you can create the currency that people
all directly benefit from when they

900
00:46:26,971 --> 00:46:30,520
gross such that you're highly
motivated to make this industry go.

901
00:46:30,521 --> 00:46:34,530
So let's take a very simple example.
So we have say a stream token, right?

902
00:46:34,680 --> 00:46:38,570
So let's say we created this currency.
We have 100,000 streams tokens,

903
00:46:38,580 --> 00:46:42,180
it's a completely finite number, right?
And let's say for example, in our case,

904
00:46:42,181 --> 00:46:44,130
right? The use cases are
like live streaming tips.

905
00:46:44,131 --> 00:46:47,880
It's a $5 billion industry right now, or
Patriot loss models and so forth, right?

906
00:46:47,881 --> 00:46:51,570
People sending money from
users to concentrators. So
say people convert there,

907
00:46:51,580 --> 00:46:53,820
other currencies into this currency,
you use it for those cases.

908
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:57,180
Now people have come here with
$100,000 of that, those currencies.

909
00:46:57,420 --> 00:47:01,170
So now we have 100,000 streams,
logins, $100,000 as a market cap.

910
00:47:01,290 --> 00:47:05,300
So you are the expect each stream token
has about a dollar value, but oh yeah,

911
00:47:05,310 --> 00:47:07,440
perfect. And now let's say
this grows over time, right?

912
00:47:07,441 --> 00:47:10,260
There's more people want to use this
currency for the goods and services I can

913
00:47:10,261 --> 00:47:13,830
provide. We now have saved. The
thing grows too. In my example,

914
00:47:13,831 --> 00:47:18,810
I'll just say $500,000 right?
So now we have 100,000 stream tokens,

915
00:47:18,811 --> 00:47:21,900
a market cap of $500,000
that's about $5 per token.

916
00:47:21,901 --> 00:47:24,030
And this is the naive model
that's a bitcoin takes, right?

917
00:47:24,150 --> 00:47:27,960
It's just that you capture the value
from the growth for the US economy by

918
00:47:28,020 --> 00:47:30,880
basically having each unit of
value be worth more over time.

919
00:47:31,030 --> 00:47:32,950
That's actually not the most
interesting thing that you can do.

920
00:47:33,090 --> 00:47:35,830
What you can do in this case is actually
similar to what central bank can do.

921
00:47:35,980 --> 00:47:40,330
You can emit more tokens. So let's say
we actually met 400,000 new tokens.

922
00:47:40,420 --> 00:47:44,920
So now we have $500,000 in this economy.
We have five and 2000 tokens.

923
00:47:45,070 --> 00:47:48,400
So we don't change the size of the
economy by printing more tokens.

924
00:47:48,550 --> 00:47:50,590
But over time,
discounting velocity of money,

925
00:47:50,620 --> 00:47:53,590
you are the imagined that it would revert
to this fundamental mean where we have

926
00:47:53,591 --> 00:47:56,050
a dollar per token stove,
right? You have 500,000 tokens,

927
00:47:56,140 --> 00:48:00,820
$500,000 but we have literally
created $400,000 of real new money,

928
00:48:00,821 --> 00:48:03,280
right? So what can we do with
that? Well, interestingly enough,

929
00:48:03,281 --> 00:48:07,090
we can distribute that back to everyone
who has contributed to the growth in

930
00:48:07,091 --> 00:48:09,400
this economy over time to
incentivize them to grow the economy.

931
00:48:09,520 --> 00:48:12,700
So let's say we split this in the most
simple way. We could split 50 50 right?

932
00:48:12,850 --> 00:48:16,630
We take 200,000 of these new tokens that
we made with $200,000 of real value.

933
00:48:16,810 --> 00:48:18,190
We give it to everyone
who held tokens today.

934
00:48:18,191 --> 00:48:20,110
So if you had one stream token for dollar,

935
00:48:20,111 --> 00:48:22,900
now you have three stream tokens worth
a dollar each, but three times as much.

936
00:48:23,080 --> 00:48:27,430
But we also have $200,000 of new money
that we created, and now that money,

937
00:48:27,580 --> 00:48:30,220
we can actually distribute back
to say constant creators, right?

938
00:48:30,221 --> 00:48:32,320
The people who have made
these videos such a,

939
00:48:32,330 --> 00:48:35,710
now they have a revenue stream
without any direct costs to users that

940
00:48:35,711 --> 00:48:38,800
incentivizes them strongly such that
if you have say a million views,

941
00:48:38,801 --> 00:48:39,940
you would just possibly,

942
00:48:39,970 --> 00:48:43,720
if you have like 50% of the views of
everyone on the spot, what to say, right?

943
00:48:43,930 --> 00:48:47,110
You have $100,000 that we give you
in stream tokens for free, right?

944
00:48:47,111 --> 00:48:48,850
For having contributed
to that network effect.

945
00:48:48,851 --> 00:48:51,990
So you can strongly in gender or someone
wanting to contribute to that network.

946
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:52,833
In fact,
over time,

947
00:48:52,950 --> 00:48:57,950
and so now we've created a new revenue
stream that basically was once the domain

948
00:48:58,241 --> 00:48:59,290
of just governments,
right?

949
00:48:59,320 --> 00:49:02,500
It's a silent tax and everyone
who holds US dollars day is a,

950
00:49:02,501 --> 00:49:03,700
if you take the u s dollar,

951
00:49:03,850 --> 00:49:06,460
you would see that the US economy
does keep growing over time, right?

952
00:49:06,550 --> 00:49:08,350
So as the u s economy
kept growing over time,

953
00:49:08,351 --> 00:49:10,090
if you have a finite supply of US dollars,

954
00:49:10,180 --> 00:49:12,820
you are the imagine that
each year scholars should
have more buying power over

955
00:49:12,821 --> 00:49:16,960
time, but doesn't, right? It actually
depreciates by about 2% or 3% every year.

956
00:49:17,040 --> 00:49:20,170
And the reason for that is because while
that value has to be going somewhere,

957
00:49:20,171 --> 00:49:22,330
right, someone must be capturing that
value and it's the government, right?

958
00:49:22,331 --> 00:49:24,490
When they print more money,
they captured themselves.

959
00:49:24,670 --> 00:49:28,300
And for the first time
we have an opportunity to
actually distribute that back

960
00:49:28,540 --> 00:49:31,170
to the people who are actually responsible
for the growth for that economy over

961
00:49:31,171 --> 00:49:34,300
time. It's not just one real quick thing.
There's a lot more to it, but yeah,

962
00:49:34,330 --> 00:49:35,320
while open up for questions,

963
00:49:35,770 --> 00:49:39,820
you guys have anything you want
to dive in more detail? Yeah.

964
00:49:40,060 --> 00:49:44,980
So what are the biggest risks
for cryptocurrencies? Yeah,
that's a great question.

965
00:49:44,980 --> 00:49:48,900
So personally my philosophy is
this, right? I see that. Um, oh,

966
00:49:49,230 --> 00:49:50,080
that's a great question.
Yeah.

967
00:49:50,081 --> 00:49:52,120
What are the biggest risks
for cryptocurrencies today?

968
00:49:52,150 --> 00:49:55,210
So there are a lot of things that can
happen and it is, um, a lot of them,

969
00:49:55,211 --> 00:49:57,820
I would consider it to be black swan
events that are almost inevitable in the

970
00:49:57,821 --> 00:50:00,730
short term, but in the long
term. So what we can see is, um,

971
00:50:01,810 --> 00:50:06,010
I actually considered cryptocurrency to
be, um, this concept of expected value,

972
00:50:06,011 --> 00:50:10,060
right? Like plus or minus expected value.
It's a term that's often used in poker,

973
00:50:10,061 --> 00:50:14,710
right? So in poker it's basically a
dilatation of probability. It's like no.

974
00:50:15,130 --> 00:50:18,580
I would say maybe even if bitcoin
has a 90% chance of failure,

975
00:50:18,581 --> 00:50:22,910
it can be a good bet for you to put some
of your money into f in that 10% that

976
00:50:22,950 --> 00:50:25,480
succeeds, you expect to
succeed more than 10 x, right?

977
00:50:25,660 --> 00:50:27,890
Then that's a positive expected value.
But so let's see,

978
00:50:27,891 --> 00:50:29,890
what are those things that
could cause it the hub? No,

979
00:50:29,891 --> 00:50:31,100
I actually do believe that's still,

980
00:50:31,101 --> 00:50:35,180
it's an extremely high risk speculative
investment. Right? And so that's sort of,

981
00:50:35,181 --> 00:50:35,540
again,

982
00:50:35,540 --> 00:50:38,840
it may be worth your money played being
pulled into this thing if you believe

983
00:50:38,930 --> 00:50:42,470
that the expected value is over that.
So in the short term,

984
00:50:43,040 --> 00:50:44,480
this is why I don't day trade,
right?

985
00:50:44,510 --> 00:50:49,280
I think it's actually easier to see and
predict what possibilities they coin may

986
00:50:49,281 --> 00:50:51,230
have in the for the long
term than the short term.

987
00:50:51,231 --> 00:50:54,080
What this world of the media things
that can happen. For example,

988
00:50:54,081 --> 00:50:57,080
what are the things that actually caused
the price of bitcoin and ethereum and

989
00:50:57,081 --> 00:50:58,190
all these things to drop the most?

990
00:50:58,280 --> 00:51:01,160
There are black swan events that happened
that you fundamentally can't predict.

991
00:51:01,280 --> 00:51:04,040
You can have pretty good assurance
over time that they will happen,

992
00:51:04,041 --> 00:51:06,080
but you don't know when they'll happen.
So for example,

993
00:51:06,110 --> 00:51:10,280
in 2013 the price of bitcoin went all
the way up to 20 a $1,200 and then the

994
00:51:10,281 --> 00:51:13,040
creative immediately because
Mt Gox was hacked, right? Mt.

995
00:51:13,041 --> 00:51:16,270
Gox lost hundreds of millions of dollars
that immediately made the price fall

996
00:51:16,271 --> 00:51:18,080
and become stagnant for the
next three years, right?

997
00:51:18,081 --> 00:51:22,970
They went all the way down to less
than $200. So over 80% or 85% fell.

998
00:51:23,240 --> 00:51:26,690
And for example, another thing happened
with the Dow. So ethereum again,

999
00:51:26,691 --> 00:51:28,830
has all these enormous potential,
uh,

1000
00:51:28,970 --> 00:51:32,360
applications and that you can create
smart contracts, smart contracts. Again,

1001
00:51:32,361 --> 00:51:36,290
those Turing complete code, that code can
basically do anything. So for example,

1002
00:51:36,291 --> 00:51:39,410
they have this concept of these
centralized autonomous organizations.

1003
00:51:39,500 --> 00:51:41,010
So Take Uber, for example, right?

1004
00:51:41,100 --> 00:51:43,250
Uber is a company that
technically it's a company today,

1005
00:51:43,400 --> 00:51:45,980
but it's really just code, right?
There's no reason you can adjust,

1006
00:51:46,070 --> 00:51:49,880
have this code via Turing complete thing
that you put into the blockchain and

1007
00:51:49,881 --> 00:51:52,400
they would just run by itself and you
wouldn't even need a company to run it,

1008
00:51:52,401 --> 00:51:55,670
right? They would just be decentralized
and autonomous who'd run by itself.

1009
00:51:55,850 --> 00:51:59,150
And so the first concept was this thing
that they created that was called the

1010
00:51:59,151 --> 00:51:59,601
Dow,
right?

1011
00:51:59,601 --> 00:52:02,450
There was like self names and there
was an investment funds and they said

1012
00:52:02,600 --> 00:52:06,380
everyone put your money into the dao
and we're going to have you all vote on

1013
00:52:06,381 --> 00:52:09,260
where you want this money to be invested.
And they thought this was a good idea.

1014
00:52:09,261 --> 00:52:12,620
I'm a little skeptical but you know they
put $150 million into this thing and

1015
00:52:12,621 --> 00:52:16,460
people were super excited but it didn't
even cross because like they made bad

1016
00:52:16,461 --> 00:52:21,110
investments. It failed because
someone found that code is law,

1017
00:52:21,140 --> 00:52:24,890
right? But curve is fallible. Curve is
written by humans that can make mistakes.

1018
00:52:25,010 --> 00:52:28,100
And so the code had an exploit where
someone could actually siphon the funds

1019
00:52:28,130 --> 00:52:31,490
directly into child doubt, right? And
like basically control of themselves.

1020
00:52:31,700 --> 00:52:33,290
And so they were like, holy
crap, this is terrible.

1021
00:52:33,291 --> 00:52:36,380
Atherium was rising all the
way up to $22 at that point.

1022
00:52:36,590 --> 00:52:38,120
And then the Dow had this hack,
right?

1023
00:52:38,121 --> 00:52:40,790
Someone stole $50 million and
it actually has a hard fork.

1024
00:52:40,791 --> 00:52:43,700
All the doubts and re uh,
Re uh, retrieved the funds.

1025
00:52:43,910 --> 00:52:47,030
But in that time etherium fell down
to $7. Right? So in the short term,

1026
00:52:47,031 --> 00:52:49,880
those are the existential risks I see.
Right? Regulation can happen, right?

1027
00:52:49,881 --> 00:52:53,900
China's size, we banned all ics that
creatives market, the u s is like, Yo,

1028
00:52:53,920 --> 00:52:55,970
we're going to ban exchanges,
right? That craters market.

1029
00:52:56,120 --> 00:52:58,100
Those are all the short term
existential risks that we see.

1030
00:52:58,220 --> 00:53:01,280
Maybe some of those are long,
large enough that they, you know,

1031
00:53:01,460 --> 00:53:05,000
so far damaged the trust in bitcoin.
That doesn't get to long term.

1032
00:53:05,180 --> 00:53:08,300
But actually I think these are all
things that like you can't predict window

1033
00:53:08,301 --> 00:53:10,430
happened or how though happens
or any of those things.

1034
00:53:10,430 --> 00:53:13,300
They're just like a inextricably tied to,
you know,

1035
00:53:13,310 --> 00:53:17,000
just like uncertainty and
the sorts, everybody in the
long term actually I think,

1036
00:53:17,001 --> 00:53:20,510
um,
there are the only,

1037
00:53:20,511 --> 00:53:23,780
like the big risks is that some like
the governments or something, right?

1038
00:53:23,781 --> 00:53:26,900
Like trying to tackle this thing
and talk it so far that like, um,

1039
00:53:26,970 --> 00:53:31,110
it doesn't get off the ground or they
replace it or say quantum computing for

1040
00:53:31,111 --> 00:53:31,471
example,

1041
00:53:31,471 --> 00:53:35,910
like technically the house function
that protects bitcoin is something that

1042
00:53:35,911 --> 00:53:38,440
isn't computationally
impossible to reverse engineer.

1043
00:53:38,460 --> 00:53:39,810
It just computationally hard.

1044
00:53:39,960 --> 00:53:43,050
There's no technical technology
today that can say like,

1045
00:53:43,051 --> 00:53:46,710
we can reverse engineer a cryptographic
one way hash function easily,

1046
00:53:46,820 --> 00:53:49,560
but in the future, maybe with constant
Peter's, it'd be really trivial for us to,

1047
00:53:49,680 --> 00:53:52,560
you know, brute force, that solution.
So those are things that can happen,

1048
00:53:52,561 --> 00:53:56,370
but also at the same time, um, the code
itself can be modified over time. Right.

1049
00:53:56,371 --> 00:53:58,500
So I'm can fork it and just
have a system that's resistant.

1050
00:54:01,060 --> 00:54:01,893
Yeah.

1051
00:54:02,770 --> 00:54:07,740
It seems pretty hard to make
kind of obvious decisions. Yup.

1052
00:54:08,650 --> 00:54:10,580
Yeah, yeah. Yeah.

1053
00:54:11,590 --> 00:54:14,300
That's a great question. Thanks. Yeah.

1054
00:54:14,450 --> 00:54:18,890
So basically it seems like it's pretty
hard to come to consensus in the bitcoin

1055
00:54:18,891 --> 00:54:21,680
community, right? So how are decisions
made? And that's a great question.

1056
00:54:21,710 --> 00:54:24,770
And actually this is a difference
between the lot of different systems or a

1057
00:54:24,771 --> 00:54:28,070
bitcoin itself specifically has a hard
time consuming coming to consensus

1058
00:54:28,071 --> 00:54:29,240
because there's no clear leader.

1059
00:54:29,360 --> 00:54:32,510
So this is the Toshi knock and Barlow
made the coin and then think just left,

1060
00:54:32,511 --> 00:54:34,160
right? Like at some point.
And he's like, all right,

1061
00:54:34,161 --> 00:54:36,680
like it seems like this thing's taken off.
I only have to be here anymore.

1062
00:54:36,681 --> 00:54:37,730
So he's no longer there.

1063
00:54:37,820 --> 00:54:42,530
So what happens now is that there are a
lot of ideological splits and camps that

1064
00:54:42,680 --> 00:54:44,760
now have influence over bitcoin.
And in fact,

1065
00:54:44,770 --> 00:54:46,550
so there are people who
have real influence.

1066
00:54:46,551 --> 00:54:49,790
And then there are people who are
like these, uh, like leaders, right?

1067
00:54:49,810 --> 00:54:52,460
Thought leaders in the case.
So for example, this is
what happened very recently.

1068
00:54:52,790 --> 00:54:55,730
Um,
a huge question was the scaling debate.

1069
00:54:55,910 --> 00:55:00,040
So bitcoin is now actually reasonably
expensive to use for small micro

1070
00:55:00,041 --> 00:55:01,490
transactions.
And the reason for that,

1071
00:55:01,491 --> 00:55:05,990
and it's because the blockchain
is actually an incredibly
inefficient system to,

1072
00:55:06,150 --> 00:55:06,440
uh,

1073
00:55:06,440 --> 00:55:09,220
convey information because it's something
that's replicated across every single

1074
00:55:09,250 --> 00:55:10,940
computer that is a full node,
right?

1075
00:55:11,030 --> 00:55:14,450
And so you want to keep this ideally
as small as possible. And so right now,

1076
00:55:14,510 --> 00:55:17,720
all blocks are limited to
being one megabyte in size.

1077
00:55:17,870 --> 00:55:20,310
And this is a huge problem in some some,
uh,

1078
00:55:20,360 --> 00:55:23,810
philosophies because it means that there
are only a tiny amount of transactions

1079
00:55:23,811 --> 00:55:26,030
that can be fit in each block
and they'd give him point.

1080
00:55:26,210 --> 00:55:30,620
And specifically miners are rationally
self interested in accepting transactions.

1081
00:55:30,621 --> 00:55:33,910
I paid them the most money. So with
every transaction you spend, you signed,

1082
00:55:33,940 --> 00:55:37,340
you can specify how much money you
want to go as a reward to minors.

1083
00:55:37,430 --> 00:55:39,950
And of course, if they can only
fit a finite number in here,

1084
00:55:40,010 --> 00:55:41,870
they're going to fit the ones I
paid them the most money, right?

1085
00:55:41,871 --> 00:55:45,410
So that means that now transactions,
if you want them to happen quickly,

1086
00:55:45,620 --> 00:55:47,900
they take a lot of money. It's
a lot of people were like, well,

1087
00:55:47,901 --> 00:55:50,780
this is a huge problem. While we saw
that with the most intuitive solution,

1088
00:55:50,781 --> 00:55:52,550
which has just increased the block size,
right?

1089
00:55:52,640 --> 00:55:54,290
So that's what happened with bitcoin cash.

1090
00:55:54,350 --> 00:55:56,270
There are a lot of these people who
are like, well, this is obvious.

1091
00:55:56,271 --> 00:55:57,860
Let's just make the block size larger,
right?

1092
00:55:57,980 --> 00:56:01,160
Let's go from one megabytes
to eight megabytes and
that's going to be sufficient

1093
00:56:01,161 --> 00:56:02,360
to solve this transactional problem.

1094
00:56:02,540 --> 00:56:05,450
But a lot of people also think that this
is a short term shortsighted solution,

1095
00:56:05,451 --> 00:56:08,210
right? Because it makes the
problem go away right now,

1096
00:56:08,330 --> 00:56:10,820
but it's not going to make the problem
go away forever because you know,

1097
00:56:10,821 --> 00:56:13,760
increasing the blockchain is something
that's going to be finite and as more

1098
00:56:13,761 --> 00:56:16,130
transactions happen, it's still
going to be a problem in the future.

1099
00:56:16,130 --> 00:56:19,190
So you're basically kicking the
bucket down the road at the same time.

1100
00:56:19,310 --> 00:56:21,500
It also makes the blockchain so large,
right?

1101
00:56:21,501 --> 00:56:25,120
It makes it eight times as large going
such that it will be much more difficult

1102
00:56:25,121 --> 00:56:29,170
for it to be decentralized for people to
be able to actually hold enough data to

1103
00:56:29,171 --> 00:56:30,004
make this possible.

1104
00:56:30,430 --> 00:56:33,370
And so what happened in this case as
it was extremely difficult to come to

1105
00:56:33,371 --> 00:56:38,080
consensus because there is no one clear
person who was a spiritual leader, right?

1106
00:56:38,110 --> 00:56:42,010
Take an example for ethereum
where when the Dow hack happens,

1107
00:56:42,011 --> 00:56:44,110
actually within a month they hard forks,
right?

1108
00:56:44,111 --> 00:56:47,110
And they actually made the new currency
that reverse that transaction because

1109
00:56:47,111 --> 00:56:50,620
there was clear, uh, leaders, right?
Like Vitalik was like, all right,

1110
00:56:50,621 --> 00:56:52,960
like I made this thing, right. I
think this is the right decision.

1111
00:56:53,110 --> 00:56:55,770
People followed him and believes
in very strongly with bitcoin.

1112
00:56:55,780 --> 00:56:57,010
There's Bitcoin core,
right?

1113
00:56:57,040 --> 00:57:00,340
There are these core developers that
like technically contribute to the code,

1114
00:57:00,490 --> 00:57:02,320
but they don't actually
have that much power, right?

1115
00:57:02,410 --> 00:57:03,730
Because they contribute to code.

1116
00:57:03,731 --> 00:57:06,310
But the people who have a lot
of power are miners, right?

1117
00:57:06,311 --> 00:57:09,340
Because they're the people who actually
provide the security behind the system.

1118
00:57:09,550 --> 00:57:12,760
And so those people are actually very
rationally interested in increasing the

1119
00:57:12,761 --> 00:57:13,780
block size change size.

1120
00:57:13,781 --> 00:57:16,570
Because the alternative solution that
people are proposing right now is the

1121
00:57:16,571 --> 00:57:18,700
lightening network. So the
lightening network, for example,

1122
00:57:18,701 --> 00:57:20,350
is an off chain second layer solution.

1123
00:57:20,351 --> 00:57:23,440
So what we mean by that
is transactions they take,

1124
00:57:23,441 --> 00:57:25,690
the philosophy of transactions on
the blockchain are always going to be

1125
00:57:25,691 --> 00:57:27,040
inherently limited in size,
right?

1126
00:57:27,041 --> 00:57:30,190
We can't possibly fit every
single transaction you ever
want on the blockchain.

1127
00:57:30,280 --> 00:57:30,930
So instead,

1128
00:57:30,930 --> 00:57:35,560
why don't we just take transactions off
the blockchain and the make extremely

1129
00:57:35,561 --> 00:57:39,490
cheap, extremely fast, uh, transactions
on the, off the blockchain possible.

1130
00:57:39,700 --> 00:57:42,820
And so what you do now is you opened
basically war called payment channels and

1131
00:57:42,821 --> 00:57:45,010
how you open the payment channel
to say Alison, Bob, right?

1132
00:57:45,130 --> 00:57:48,190
They want to send money back to
each other. So they have $100 each.

1133
00:57:48,370 --> 00:57:52,580
They do a multisignature transaction.
So they both agreed to basically, uh,

1134
00:57:52,750 --> 00:57:55,600
put one transaction on the
blockchain. So they put, um,

1135
00:57:56,170 --> 00:57:58,750
they both signed this reduction,
they put $100 in this thing,

1136
00:57:58,751 --> 00:58:01,140
they opened a payment channel,
and then in that payment channel,

1137
00:58:01,180 --> 00:58:03,040
what they can do is they can send money,

1138
00:58:03,100 --> 00:58:07,210
if only back and forth to each other in
the form of ics without closing this on

1139
00:58:07,211 --> 00:58:10,650
the blockchain itself without paying
any costs. So maybe they paid $3, right?

1140
00:58:10,651 --> 00:58:13,930
So let's make this first transaction that
goes on the blockchain and then in the

1141
00:58:13,931 --> 00:58:17,140
future, say Alice is like, Oh, I owe you
some dollars for like a Uber ride, right?

1142
00:58:17,140 --> 00:58:22,140
So she pays $7 to Bob and now their
balances updates such an Alice now has $93

1143
00:58:22,661 --> 00:58:26,170
in this Iou, right? And Bob has
$107, right? And they can sign,

1144
00:58:26,171 --> 00:58:29,920
say a thousand transactions back and
forth on this IOU thing before suddenly in

1145
00:58:29,930 --> 00:58:33,280
blockchain doesn't matter, right? Because
as long as they both have some none,

1146
00:58:33,281 --> 00:58:34,031
zero balance rate,

1147
00:58:34,031 --> 00:58:36,940
they can keep sending money back and
forth and then say a thousand transactions

1148
00:58:36,941 --> 00:58:40,330
live, they finally decide to close this
thing. They pay another like $3 right?

1149
00:58:40,331 --> 00:58:43,570
To actually finally settle.
It's like Allison's up with $50 in.

1150
00:58:43,571 --> 00:58:47,080
Bob Ends up with 150 they sell it on
the blockchain and now they've only paid

1151
00:58:47,081 --> 00:58:48,550
for two transactions on the blockchain.

1152
00:58:48,580 --> 00:58:51,580
Even if they sent a thousand transactions
back and forth to each other, right?

1153
00:58:51,790 --> 00:58:55,540
And this actually can scale because you
can have nodes that connect to other

1154
00:58:55,541 --> 00:58:57,570
nodes. Even if you don't have a direct
connection from the other party.

1155
00:58:57,580 --> 00:58:59,650
Say Bob is connected with Kathy,
right?

1156
00:58:59,770 --> 00:59:03,130
And like Alice now can send money to Kathy
through Bob even if they don't have a

1157
00:59:03,131 --> 00:59:03,850
direct connection.

1158
00:59:03,850 --> 00:59:07,150
So through hubs you can basically send
money to anyone through the system and

1159
00:59:07,151 --> 00:59:11,020
you really uh, solve kind of this a
problem with like on changers actions.

1160
00:59:11,021 --> 00:59:13,030
You just move most of
transactions off chain.

1161
00:59:13,690 --> 00:59:16,970
And so the problem is this is a solution
that makes a lot of sense to a lot of

1162
00:59:16,971 --> 00:59:21,510
the people because it is a like longterm
cited solution that will like obviate

1163
00:59:21,530 --> 00:59:25,490
the problem with like we always need to
keep increasing the block size but is

1164
00:59:25,491 --> 00:59:27,850
against the rational self interest
and minors. Right? Because my,

1165
00:59:27,851 --> 00:59:30,710
there is don't make any money when
you do off change his actions,

1166
00:59:30,711 --> 00:59:33,860
they only make money when you put
transactions on the blockchain, right?

1167
00:59:34,040 --> 00:59:37,070
And so of course they want all the
transactions to stay on the blockchain.

1168
00:59:37,220 --> 00:59:40,400
So that's why they were the advocate for
say an eight docs bunching size. Right?

1169
00:59:40,550 --> 00:59:43,610
And so because there are these like
mal lines, economic incentives,

1170
00:59:43,611 --> 00:59:47,120
it's really hard to come to consensus
even beyond the fact that there's no, uh,

1171
00:59:47,240 --> 00:59:49,010
economic leader.
So it is a problem.

1172
00:59:49,130 --> 00:59:52,530
Yeah.
I think I saw you as hers

1173
00:59:55,290 --> 00:59:56,123
a little bit.

1174
01:00:00,320 --> 01:00:01,153
Exactly.

1175
01:00:04,330 --> 01:00:09,330
Is it de facto? I mean, I, I find it,

1176
01:00:09,920 --> 01:00:13,160
that'd be, yeah. The other incentives,

1177
01:00:13,161 --> 01:00:15,050
like it doesn't have to be a government

1178
01:00:19,690 --> 01:00:23,600
want to
go.

1179
01:00:26,880 --> 01:00:29,050
Yeah. So that's a great question.
So basically you're right.

1180
01:00:29,080 --> 01:00:31,570
Like bitcoin itself is
inherently scarce in the sunset.

1181
01:00:31,571 --> 01:00:33,360
Like bitcoins will not increase the value,

1182
01:00:33,370 --> 01:00:35,860
but people can just make many
different other currencies.

1183
01:00:35,861 --> 01:00:38,620
So that was the question is like,
is it really scarce?

1184
01:00:38,680 --> 01:00:40,150
Are cryptocurrencies really scarce?

1185
01:00:40,210 --> 01:00:43,150
Because you can just have infinitely many
different cryptocurrencies and that's

1186
01:00:43,151 --> 01:00:46,100
actually correct. Right? Well, it's the
same reason that like, you know, um,

1187
01:00:46,390 --> 01:00:48,310
gold for example, no one
has to use gold, right?

1188
01:00:48,311 --> 01:00:50,800
There are many other elements that
we could use as a store of value,

1189
01:00:50,801 --> 01:00:52,000
but people don't use those.
Right?

1190
01:00:52,001 --> 01:00:56,110
So ultimately it comes down to what
trusts do people have in these other

1191
01:00:56,111 --> 01:00:57,100
currencies are created.

1192
01:00:57,220 --> 01:01:00,220
And the fact that bitcoin itself has
been forked thousands of times, right?

1193
01:01:00,340 --> 01:01:04,480
And like the vast majority of those forks
technically are indistinguishable from

1194
01:01:04,481 --> 01:01:07,480
bitcoin but have no value, right? Because
people have in place on the trust in it.

1195
01:01:07,600 --> 01:01:08,650
So the real question is,

1196
01:01:08,740 --> 01:01:12,070
will people actually wants a place trust
in something else that's not bitcoin

1197
01:01:12,071 --> 01:01:13,450
itself? And Yeah, you're absolutely right.

1198
01:01:13,451 --> 01:01:15,850
Maybe there are forced utility
use cases, like you say, right?

1199
01:01:16,000 --> 01:01:19,240
All these banks or consortium of like
retailers get together and they were like,

1200
01:01:19,241 --> 01:01:22,000
in order to use Amazon, you have to use
Amazon point or something like that,

1201
01:01:22,001 --> 01:01:25,070
right? And then that give us like some
force utility to people wanting to use US

1202
01:01:25,071 --> 01:01:27,040
system. And that's certainly
a possibility, right?

1203
01:01:27,041 --> 01:01:29,500
Certainly other cryptocurrencies
have value, right? Like right now,

1204
01:01:29,501 --> 01:01:34,240
bitcoin's worth under $70 billion. The
total market is like $300 billion, right?

1205
01:01:34,241 --> 01:01:37,840
So clearly people want to put faith in
other currencies about the same time,

1206
01:01:37,841 --> 01:01:40,930
right? It is scarce, right?
Bitcoin itself is scarce.

1207
01:01:41,510 --> 01:01:44,350
And as long as people
want to trust Bitcoin,

1208
01:01:44,380 --> 01:01:47,200
and there are a lot of the reasons
that you actually want to trust bitcoin

1209
01:01:47,230 --> 01:01:50,110
because one, like, sure, they have
the first mover advantage, right?

1210
01:01:50,110 --> 01:01:51,640
They already have a large body of trust,

1211
01:01:51,641 --> 01:01:55,960
but also something needs to be a lot
better than bitcoin to actually replace it

1212
01:01:56,020 --> 01:01:59,230
on like this a reason trust, right? Like
if someone made exactly the same bitcoin,

1213
01:01:59,231 --> 01:02:01,660
there's no reason for someone to want to
do that. Right? So then the question is,

1214
01:02:01,661 --> 01:02:04,810
is there anything that can be a lot
better than bitcoin? I think that is, um,

1215
01:02:04,990 --> 01:02:07,860
that's really up to birds debate
and I think there's a lot of, uh,

1216
01:02:07,930 --> 01:02:11,440
evidence for that not being the case.
It's, um, bitcoin, like people say,

1217
01:02:11,441 --> 01:02:13,690
for example,
ethereum is a really easy case of like,

1218
01:02:13,691 --> 01:02:16,630
of course people want to use the theory
because it's so much more useful, right?

1219
01:02:16,720 --> 01:02:18,550
Like you can program
anything you want on it.

1220
01:02:18,640 --> 01:02:20,700
It can be for almost any
of these applications.

1221
01:02:20,820 --> 01:02:22,500
You can make the Amazon coin on top of it,
right?

1222
01:02:22,500 --> 01:02:25,110
You can make an Erc 20 token
that lives on top of ethereum.

1223
01:02:25,111 --> 01:02:26,820
So why would someone want to use bitcoin?
Well,

1224
01:02:26,821 --> 01:02:29,130
actually there are a lot of trade
offs, right? With all of these things.

1225
01:02:29,250 --> 01:02:31,050
Bitcoin takes very few promises.

1226
01:02:31,051 --> 01:02:33,990
Bitcoin promises to be a
currency that works really well.

1227
01:02:34,110 --> 01:02:37,170
You theory and makes an enormous amount
promises and each of those promises is

1228
01:02:37,171 --> 01:02:39,690
something that can damage trust if
they don't fulfill that promise.

1229
01:02:39,780 --> 01:02:44,130
So specifically you can actually have
smart contracts as a second layer on top

1230
01:02:44,131 --> 01:02:45,060
of the coin itself.

1231
01:02:45,120 --> 01:02:48,660
So you can have a risk smart contract
that I'm works basically the same as like

1232
01:02:48,690 --> 01:02:50,160
Ethiopian smart contracts would,

1233
01:02:50,310 --> 01:02:53,460
but etherium has designed that to
be part of its base layer, right?

1234
01:02:53,550 --> 01:02:57,090
So the scripting language, free theory,
Ms Turing, complete audience base layer,

1235
01:02:57,240 --> 01:02:58,830
this is really bad for a lot reasons,

1236
01:02:59,250 --> 01:03:03,600
possibly because the scripting language
can be very poorly written. And uh,

1237
01:03:03,601 --> 01:03:07,600
it can be like very subject to more
exploits and vulnerabilities and bitcoin

1238
01:03:07,620 --> 01:03:11,760
itself would, right? Because bitcoin
is kept the tax space very small.

1239
01:03:12,030 --> 01:03:13,260
And so for example,
if we're hearing,

1240
01:03:13,261 --> 01:03:15,450
we've actually seen this happen a
lot of times, or there's a Perry,

1241
01:03:15,460 --> 01:03:19,260
the multisite hack that happened recently
where they lost like $150 million,

1242
01:03:19,261 --> 01:03:21,610
right? And that was because
the guy, this is lower,

1243
01:03:21,611 --> 01:03:25,230
the guy who made the
etherium yellow paper, right?

1244
01:03:25,231 --> 01:03:29,790
He basically created the
scripting language on ethereum
called solidity, right?

1245
01:03:29,791 --> 01:03:31,540
And he used to prepare the,
but the,

1246
01:03:31,590 --> 01:03:35,340
the scripting language like is not
that well written to be very secure,

1247
01:03:35,430 --> 01:03:40,070
such that like he introduced a very
simple bug basically where, uh,

1248
01:03:40,230 --> 01:03:41,270
he called you,

1249
01:03:41,330 --> 01:03:45,180
you wanna like initialize a library
function and like you want to save on gas

1250
01:03:45,181 --> 01:03:47,160
costs, you reuse the same
code over and over again.

1251
01:03:47,161 --> 01:03:48,540
So he initialized this library.

1252
01:03:48,720 --> 01:03:52,530
But in the library there's a function
that you could call that would basically,

1253
01:03:52,740 --> 01:03:57,300
uh, reinitialize a wallet and
assign a new owner to this wallet.

1254
01:03:57,360 --> 01:03:59,970
And so of course, this is a function that
you only want to be able to call once,

1255
01:03:59,971 --> 01:04:00,840
right?
To start this thing.

1256
01:04:01,050 --> 01:04:04,860
And then no other person should be able
to be able to call this function method.

1257
01:04:05,250 --> 01:04:10,250
But unfortunately what he did was he
wrote this code and he didn't realize that

1258
01:04:10,891 --> 01:04:14,160
he actually put an edge case in this
code where it said if you send money,

1259
01:04:14,161 --> 01:04:15,720
this is to create a multisig wallet.

1260
01:04:15,721 --> 01:04:18,270
So if you guys are familiar with multisig
wallet is a wallet where you can have

1261
01:04:18,271 --> 01:04:20,280
multiple owners such that you have three,

1262
01:04:20,281 --> 01:04:23,880
say three out of five people need to sign
a transaction before it actually goes

1263
01:04:23,881 --> 01:04:28,410
live. And so in this case, it's supposed
to be the most secure thing ever, right?

1264
01:04:28,410 --> 01:04:30,810
Because like you don't have
one central point of failure,

1265
01:04:30,811 --> 01:04:33,570
you have like five different points
of failure. So it's a lot more robust.

1266
01:04:33,750 --> 01:04:36,750
But in fact you could just circumvent
this whole system if you actually have to.

1267
01:04:36,751 --> 01:04:38,010
Code itself is vulnerable,
right?

1268
01:04:38,011 --> 01:04:40,980
And so that's what happened because he
had an exception handler where it was a

1269
01:04:40,981 --> 01:04:42,270
very friendly exception handler.

1270
01:04:42,420 --> 01:04:47,040
It said basically that f you tried to
call a function that wasn't defined in the

1271
01:04:47,070 --> 01:04:49,230
code for the multisig itself.
Don't worry about it.

1272
01:04:49,290 --> 01:04:52,260
We'll actually search our libraries and
see if the function is called there.

1273
01:04:52,261 --> 01:04:54,900
Right? And so, uh, if the
function is defined there,

1274
01:04:54,901 --> 01:04:56,220
then we'll just call it for you.

1275
01:04:56,370 --> 01:04:59,820
So then someone just like called these
like multisig wallets and like call the

1276
01:04:59,821 --> 01:05:02,910
function to reinitialize wall and sign
themselves as the owner and just went

1277
01:05:02,911 --> 01:05:03,744
through.
Right.

1278
01:05:03,840 --> 01:05:07,730
And so that's a problem with like maybe
having more functionality on top of like

1279
01:05:07,731 --> 01:05:08,281
bit coin itself.

1280
01:05:08,281 --> 01:05:13,020
Just as one example for why bitcoin
actually is like a very well done system

1281
01:05:13,050 --> 01:05:14,810
that may be hard for
something as supersede.

1282
01:05:18,060 --> 01:05:20,940
I actually don't. So I actually disagree
with Ben on some of this stuff. Um,

1283
01:05:21,010 --> 01:05:25,530
I think so from my perspective,
I think I, with the scarcity, um,

1284
01:05:25,910 --> 01:05:28,450
I mean I think that the engineering
problem, I think for example,

1285
01:05:28,451 --> 01:05:30,370
having a currency as a
store of value right there,

1286
01:05:30,371 --> 01:05:32,530
there is a lot in the same
way that gold is function,

1287
01:05:32,560 --> 01:05:36,030
there is a lot of value within that.
Um, I actually think like, man,

1288
01:05:36,190 --> 01:05:39,190
this is like giving the incentive
alignment. We have minors,

1289
01:05:39,220 --> 01:05:43,450
different different reasons for
different parts of Bitcoin to evolve. Um,

1290
01:05:43,451 --> 01:05:45,760
it's actually really interesting it also
thinking about presenting the proof of

1291
01:05:45,761 --> 01:05:49,180
work right now. Right now, what that's
led to is just giant mining farms,

1292
01:05:49,181 --> 01:05:49,631
for example,

1293
01:05:49,631 --> 01:05:53,080
in China and other places in which
there's been an enormous amount of

1294
01:05:53,081 --> 01:05:57,910
computational power spent generating
random numbers that has no real utility or

1295
01:05:57,911 --> 01:06:01,120
value. Right. In the same
way, like for example, if you
look at it [inaudible] case,

1296
01:06:01,490 --> 01:06:02,100
um,

1297
01:06:02,100 --> 01:06:05,080
the differences that you're actually
using computational power density run code

1298
01:06:05,081 --> 01:06:06,980
on the network. So I
think it's interesting, I,

1299
01:06:06,981 --> 01:06:10,300
I from my perspective is that I think
blocked like there is going to be a

1300
01:06:10,301 --> 01:06:11,950
solution,
whether it's Bitcoin,

1301
01:06:11,951 --> 01:06:14,620
inevitably I think it has the
clear first mover advantage,

1302
01:06:14,621 --> 01:06:16,660
but I think you know better,
for example,

1303
01:06:16,930 --> 01:06:19,990
proof of like better proof
of whatever it might be. Um,

1304
01:06:20,020 --> 01:06:23,770
systems might actually end up becoming
better then you might have you taken,

1305
01:06:23,840 --> 01:06:26,900
how does that evolve? Like I think
this is all up in the air, um,

1306
01:06:27,070 --> 01:06:31,000
in terms of what there's
so much innovation going to
happen and Bitcoin is just

1307
01:06:31,030 --> 01:06:33,610
one that we all know and we think,
um,

1308
01:06:33,640 --> 01:06:36,160
but whether it becomes a clear
winner in the long run, like, right.

1309
01:06:36,161 --> 01:06:36,731
I think there's,

1310
01:06:36,731 --> 01:06:39,820
there's a lot of debate clearly right
around a lot of this stuff that's

1311
01:06:39,821 --> 01:06:43,060
happening and what technologies can be
better. So this is something, but it's,

1312
01:06:43,160 --> 01:06:45,310
I think once that,
one takeaway is that they're like,

1313
01:06:45,950 --> 01:06:49,030
scarcity is important in terms of
people trusting within the currency,

1314
01:06:49,031 --> 01:06:52,420
but there are clearly problems with what
we have already and there's going to

1315
01:06:52,421 --> 01:06:56,110
clearly need to be innovative solutions
to scaling going forward. Um, yeah,

1316
01:06:56,290 --> 01:06:57,940
I grew up fat. Right.
It's not a binary system.

1317
01:06:57,941 --> 01:06:59,270
It's not like when
they're takes all right.

1318
01:06:59,300 --> 01:07:02,710
There's certainly room for many different
players and specifically because there

1319
01:07:02,711 --> 01:07:04,930
are tradeoffs with every system
that you would implement. Yeah.

1320
01:07:05,290 --> 01:07:08,440
There are two systems that may
work for different purposes, right?

1321
01:07:09,070 --> 01:07:13,570
Yup, Yup. Yeah. We can
do, if you think of all

1322
01:07:15,080 --> 01:07:17,460
the, Yup, Yup,

1323
01:07:21,590 --> 01:07:24,220
Yup,
Yup.

1324
01:07:26,760 --> 01:07:31,760
Totally getting the approvers of Bitcoin
or I can put it in cool switch that

1325
01:07:34,170 --> 01:07:37,890
holds a on the paper it or like try
to remember it in my head's like, Yup,

1326
01:07:37,970 --> 01:07:41,400
it's like die those goons, all
this, whatever. So absolutely,

1327
01:07:41,490 --> 01:07:46,490
absolutely perfect way to score
and I know exactly what you are.

1328
01:07:48,060 --> 01:07:52,200
That's great. Sure.

1329
01:07:53,640 --> 01:07:54,930
No one takes my backpack right there.

1330
01:07:55,290 --> 01:07:58,900
Well, anyway, yeah. So very
specifically to your, to your point,

1331
01:07:58,901 --> 01:08:01,450
that's a great question. So the
question again was, you know,

1332
01:08:01,480 --> 01:08:03,340
security seems like a trade
off with Bitcoin, right?

1333
01:08:03,341 --> 01:08:06,130
Because those fundamental value
proposition is you own your own money,

1334
01:08:06,280 --> 01:08:08,350
but with great power comes
great responsibility, right?

1335
01:08:08,420 --> 01:08:11,410
If you control your own money, then
it's hard to spend and if you spend it,

1336
01:08:11,411 --> 01:08:14,020
it can be compromised. Like all these
things, you can lose your own coins,

1337
01:08:14,021 --> 01:08:17,030
you can lose your private keys. So status
should you keep it on like an exchange,

1338
01:08:17,031 --> 01:08:20,030
right? Like which takes analog
of a bank, but then, you know,

1339
01:08:20,031 --> 01:08:23,090
the bank had just like lose its money
or like go out of business or get hacked

1340
01:08:23,091 --> 01:08:25,250
itself and all these things.
There are these fundamental trade off.

1341
01:08:25,251 --> 01:08:26,084
So that's a great question.

1342
01:08:26,300 --> 01:08:29,960
I would venture to say that that
actually is something that today is, um,

1343
01:08:29,990 --> 01:08:31,610
certainly in its nascent form,
right?

1344
01:08:31,700 --> 01:08:34,880
I really do say as like analogous
to the Internet in 1995, right?

1345
01:08:34,881 --> 01:08:35,714
There was like a clunky,

1346
01:08:35,720 --> 01:08:38,210
terrible thing that was extremely
difficult for most people lose, right?

1347
01:08:38,330 --> 01:08:41,030
Like any grandmother now can use Facebook
because you pressed some buttons,

1348
01:08:41,031 --> 01:08:44,110
right? And then works or Google
or youtube. But like back then,

1349
01:08:44,111 --> 01:08:48,210
and it's like you have to understand how
https works or TCP Ip and like a right

1350
01:08:48,410 --> 01:08:50,450
curve then like a terminal command line,
right?

1351
01:08:50,630 --> 01:08:52,250
And that's the same thing
with the system today, right?

1352
01:08:52,251 --> 01:08:55,370
Like you have to understand how the keep
your cryptographic private key secure,

1353
01:08:55,371 --> 01:08:57,300
right? How the sunlight's
and some random heck story.

1354
01:08:57,301 --> 01:08:59,480
Now just write what that even
means and all this stuff.

1355
01:08:59,630 --> 01:09:01,760
And so you're absolutely right.
It is a problem today and it's very scary.

1356
01:09:01,910 --> 01:09:04,880
But even today we can already see
good solutions coming out, right?

1357
01:09:04,970 --> 01:09:07,370
So there's this fundamental question
that you have with like, you know,

1358
01:09:07,371 --> 01:09:09,680
cold storage versus hots,
this hot storage, right?

1359
01:09:09,680 --> 01:09:12,620
So hot wallet is something that touches
the air and that you assume that

1360
01:09:12,621 --> 01:09:15,880
anything that communicates with the year
and that is fundamentally compromised

1361
01:09:15,881 --> 01:09:18,080
because Erin has a fundamentally
insecure layer, right?

1362
01:09:18,230 --> 01:09:22,520
So the most secure thing that people do
is you keep your money on something that

1363
01:09:22,521 --> 01:09:24,920
has never touched you in that, right?
So what you can do is, for example,

1364
01:09:24,921 --> 01:09:27,680
you have a laptop that you never
do anything with near enough for.

1365
01:09:27,681 --> 01:09:31,370
You just download the program on it and
like you generate your random, you know,

1366
01:09:31,371 --> 01:09:32,750
private key and public key pair,

1367
01:09:32,870 --> 01:09:35,090
and then you put your money in
there and then you never touch it.

1368
01:09:35,091 --> 01:09:37,370
So no one on the end that could
possibly steal this money.

1369
01:09:37,490 --> 01:09:40,280
But that's extremely arduous,
hard to like use.

1370
01:09:40,340 --> 01:09:43,340
And someone could like steal your laptop
or your laptop burns off burst and blue

1371
01:09:43,341 --> 01:09:44,330
like that, right? And it's gone.

1372
01:09:44,630 --> 01:09:47,280
And so the actually today we can
already see some alternatives.

1373
01:09:47,281 --> 01:09:49,370
So while I personally use, for
example, our hardware wallets,

1374
01:09:49,400 --> 01:09:51,170
so hall Grunewald solve this problem.
Well,

1375
01:09:51,320 --> 01:09:54,740
because it's basically an air gap system
that does allow you to use the money,

1376
01:09:54,890 --> 01:09:57,060
but also keep it secure
and away from the Internet.

1377
01:09:57,080 --> 01:10:01,430
So the two largest ones are Tresor and
ledger nano s and they take two different

1378
01:10:01,431 --> 01:10:03,080
purchase to it.
But let's talk about the treasure.

1379
01:10:03,200 --> 01:10:08,080
So trezor is beautiful because what it
does is it's basically a hardware, uh,

1380
01:10:08,390 --> 01:10:11,870
piece of thing that you actually hold
that actually stores your private keys on

1381
01:10:11,871 --> 01:10:12,200
it.

1382
01:10:12,200 --> 01:10:16,070
And then what it does is you connected
through like micro Usb to your computer.

1383
01:10:16,220 --> 01:10:18,080
But um,
the private keys,

1384
01:10:18,081 --> 01:10:22,120
we'll never be transmitted to
the actual internet or you know,

1385
01:10:22,220 --> 01:10:25,970
your computer or anything
like that because all you
actually have to do to send

1386
01:10:25,971 --> 01:10:26,661
the transaction these,

1387
01:10:26,661 --> 01:10:29,030
you have to sign a transaction
you wear for your private key.

1388
01:10:29,030 --> 01:10:30,740
You don't have to transmit
the private key yourself.

1389
01:10:30,800 --> 01:10:33,240
So what it does is it actually
signs the transaction.

1390
01:10:33,241 --> 01:10:35,870
So what you do is use software on your
computer and it's like, all right,

1391
01:10:35,871 --> 01:10:39,200
let's send $1,000 to some random address,
right? And then it's like, all right,

1392
01:10:39,230 --> 01:10:42,710
let's send this transaction
to your life or your treasure.

1393
01:10:42,740 --> 01:10:44,990
It sends it to treasure.
And then on the treasury side,

1394
01:10:44,991 --> 01:10:48,460
all has to do as a scientist transaction
on the treasury itself and then ascends

1395
01:10:48,650 --> 01:10:51,980
the signature to your computer, but never
send your private key, right? So again,

1396
01:10:51,981 --> 01:10:55,700
now you have a system where you have
to think that's aircraft that is, uh,

1397
01:10:55,730 --> 01:10:57,890
safe in of itself directly at least,
right?

1398
01:10:58,040 --> 01:11:00,920
But that you're able to use every day
for sending transactions. So that's,

1399
01:11:00,980 --> 01:11:02,390
you know, that's one example. Again,

1400
01:11:02,391 --> 01:11:04,220
multisignature [inaudible]
are another example, right?

1401
01:11:04,221 --> 01:11:08,540
It's something where you have control
of yourself over this thing and yet you

1402
01:11:08,541 --> 01:11:10,220
have like a multiple points of failure,
right?

1403
01:11:10,220 --> 01:11:13,010
It's not just like you lose your one
thing and you know, it's all gone, right?

1404
01:11:13,020 --> 01:11:16,770
You can do multiple things there. And
even so like, um, I think over time,

1405
01:11:16,950 --> 01:11:19,680
realistically if this becomes
adopted as a global curtsy,

1406
01:11:19,800 --> 01:11:22,470
we'll see even more security
measures in place. For example,

1407
01:11:22,471 --> 01:11:25,350
Coinbase has insurance on
all their hot wallets, right?

1408
01:11:25,351 --> 01:11:27,960
So actually I do keep some
of my coins on coin base.

1409
01:11:27,961 --> 01:11:30,840
My whole thesis is don't keep all
your eggs in one basket, right?

1410
01:11:30,841 --> 01:11:33,360
So I keep telling about my treasure.
I keep some of my ledger,

1411
01:11:33,540 --> 01:11:36,900
I keep some in Coinbase and all over
all of these places because coin base,

1412
01:11:36,990 --> 01:11:40,680
maybe they, they like this is their
job, right? To keep this money secure.

1413
01:11:40,770 --> 01:11:44,220
Chances are they're doing a much better
job of it then like I myself could like

1414
01:11:44,221 --> 01:11:46,200
replicate. And so for
example, what they do, right?

1415
01:11:46,230 --> 01:11:48,150
It's like they actually do Samir
[inaudible] secret sharing.

1416
01:11:48,151 --> 01:11:51,630
They split up all their private keys
into like multiple redundant parts and no

1417
01:11:51,631 --> 01:11:55,500
one employee or no one person has control
over each of these parts. But like, um,

1418
01:11:55,530 --> 01:11:58,860
they put them in like safe deposit
bags all over the world and like,

1419
01:11:58,890 --> 01:12:01,860
it would be extremely
difficult for someone to be
able to actually find each of

1420
01:12:01,861 --> 01:12:05,010
these and take the money. So they
have that as a cold storage solution.

1421
01:12:05,011 --> 01:12:06,360
And then for their hot wallet solution,

1422
01:12:06,361 --> 01:12:09,390
because in exchange must necessarily
have some coins touch the ear in that,

1423
01:12:09,391 --> 01:12:12,360
right? So how they do that?
Well, they just insure it, right?

1424
01:12:12,361 --> 01:12:16,050
So they actually have Lloyd's of London
that ensures all their hot wallet things

1425
01:12:16,110 --> 01:12:17,940
such a, you have that
security in place. Right?

1426
01:12:17,941 --> 01:12:21,480
So I think overtime solutions will happen.
They're no key points.

1427
01:12:21,481 --> 01:12:25,140
What's diversify the I just
really quick, um, yeah, use,

1428
01:12:25,200 --> 01:12:26,460
use it as a bunch of different solutions.

1429
01:12:26,500 --> 01:12:29,250
Storage and harbor wallets tends to
be the same as I use the ledger nano,

1430
01:12:29,251 --> 01:12:32,470
personally. Yeah. Just really quick.
Yeah. Thank you, Ben. That simmer

1431
01:12:33,410 --> 01:12:37,840
[inaudible].
