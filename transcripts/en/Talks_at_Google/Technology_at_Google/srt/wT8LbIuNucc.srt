1
00:00:06,060 --> 00:00:11,060
I was told I have to tell you who I am
and why I'm here and not somebody else.

2
00:00:11,850 --> 00:00:15,810
And uh, that's very funny for me.
I never do that. But at any rate,

3
00:00:15,811 --> 00:00:17,940
I should tell you,
as was indicated,

4
00:00:17,941 --> 00:00:22,440
the first 50 years of my professional
life was bent becoming a certified quantum

5
00:00:22,441 --> 00:00:27,000
mechanic. I know where from I speak
when I talk about quantum mechanics,

6
00:00:27,001 --> 00:00:31,110
I started out being a particle
physics phenomenologist.

7
00:00:31,560 --> 00:00:36,170
I moved into formal quantum field
theory and in particular non-paternity

8
00:00:36,180 --> 00:00:38,670
additive techniques in
quantum field theory.

9
00:00:39,180 --> 00:00:43,470
That led to my moving into a solid state
physics and condensed matter theory.

10
00:00:43,860 --> 00:00:45,540
And then finally I ended up talking,

11
00:00:45,660 --> 00:00:48,540
working on the subject that I'll
be talking to you about today.

12
00:00:49,350 --> 00:00:53,430
Now obviously I had no
restrictions on what I did. Okay.

13
00:00:53,820 --> 00:00:58,110
I had the world's greatest job. So the
real question is why did I leave it?

14
00:00:58,140 --> 00:01:02,430
I mean I told people my job
description when I got tenure at slack,

15
00:01:03,150 --> 00:01:04,800
it was a one liner and said,

16
00:01:04,860 --> 00:01:09,180
you are to do anything you feel like
doing for the rest of your time here.

17
00:01:10,650 --> 00:01:14,670
As long as you think it's
good science. So, I mean,

18
00:01:14,671 --> 00:01:17,490
why the hell did I retire
to do this nonsense?

19
00:01:18,780 --> 00:01:23,640
And the answer is because six years ago
I co-invented dynamic quantum clustering

20
00:01:23,650 --> 00:01:26,850
guard DQC and I created the company,

21
00:01:26,851 --> 00:01:28,770
I mean Stanford Patent that it right away.

22
00:01:28,771 --> 00:01:32,970
And there are three patents that surround
this technology now and my company

23
00:01:33,060 --> 00:01:36,580
controls the exclusive
rights to those patents. Um,

24
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:38,753
but

25
00:01:39,660 --> 00:01:43,410
the reason I wanted to make the company
go and it was clear Stanford wasn't

26
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:44,850
gonna make it go.

27
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:49,530
Their idea of how they develop something
is they tell the person who invented it,

28
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:53,340
go out and make a company.
And, and it, you know,

29
00:01:53,341 --> 00:01:56,130
you can try to avoid that for a
couple of years and then you say,

30
00:01:56,131 --> 00:02:00,060
it really isn't going to happen
unless I do it. So I did it.

31
00:02:00,420 --> 00:02:01,350
And why?

32
00:02:01,620 --> 00:02:05,700
Because I'm not a bad physicist
and I've done a lot of neat things.

33
00:02:06,180 --> 00:02:11,040
I never saved anybody's life. And I
think this has the potential to do that.

34
00:02:11,250 --> 00:02:14,460
And that's why I'm here
today to talk to you.

35
00:02:14,520 --> 00:02:18,000
And it's also why I've changed
what I'm going to talk about. Okay.

36
00:02:18,001 --> 00:02:20,460
So what is dynamic quantum clustering?

37
00:02:20,990 --> 00:02:23,160
It has a really different
way of looking at data.

38
00:02:23,820 --> 00:02:28,820
It opens up stuff that I don't think
anybody really does except the QC.

39
00:02:30,190 --> 00:02:30,620
Uh,

40
00:02:30,620 --> 00:02:35,620
it basically solves the problem of
how do I find unexpected information.

41
00:02:35,910 --> 00:02:37,650
I know nothing about the data.

42
00:02:38,250 --> 00:02:42,780
I'm looking for unexpected information
that I don't know how to look for and

43
00:02:42,781 --> 00:02:47,190
it's hidden in my large, noisy,
messy, big dataset. I dimension.

44
00:02:47,910 --> 00:02:49,620
Okay.
Or I liked the other quote,

45
00:02:49,860 --> 00:02:54,510
how can I find the needle in
my multidimensional haystack
if I have no clue what

46
00:02:54,511 --> 00:02:59,010
a needle is and there's no
guarantee it's in my haystack. Okay?

47
00:02:59,020 --> 00:03:04,020
So I need a way of looking for things
which can't use a predefined search

48
00:03:04,181 --> 00:03:07,510
strategy. Okay. One way to do this,

49
00:03:07,540 --> 00:03:11,140
Adam saws in the audience and we had a
fight about this. I love losing fights.

50
00:03:11,141 --> 00:03:15,400
I lost one to Adam. He said, well, it's
generally clustering. And I said, no,

51
00:03:15,401 --> 00:03:17,890
it's not. And then I went
back and I said, well,

52
00:03:17,891 --> 00:03:21,640
it's been a long time since I went to
Wikipedia and look up the definition of

53
00:03:21,641 --> 00:03:26,110
clustering. I said, clustering didn't
mean looking for a long complex,

54
00:03:26,111 --> 00:03:30,460
extended structures in the data. Well,
it turns out that's wrong. I was wrong.

55
00:03:30,461 --> 00:03:33,910
Clustering since I looked last.
Got that as part of the thing.

56
00:03:34,390 --> 00:03:36,550
Not too many things to do it,
but that's what it is.

57
00:03:36,551 --> 00:03:41,551
But the typical ways of
looking for unsupervised stuff
will be hierarchical or k

58
00:03:43,211 --> 00:03:47,830
means clustering. There are
things called DB scan, HDB scan,

59
00:03:47,860 --> 00:03:52,480
the current gold standard for
biology work, t Sni, HDB scan,

60
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:54,400
a Gaussian modeling.

61
00:03:54,430 --> 00:03:58,930
All of these things have
several requirements which
we have to get rid of if

62
00:03:58,931 --> 00:04:03,850
we're looking for unexpected stuff.
One is they need to clean the data.

63
00:04:04,750 --> 00:04:09,670
They have tuneable parameters. They build
assumptions as to what clusters are,

64
00:04:09,671 --> 00:04:12,760
how many clusters there are
and what you're looking for.

65
00:04:12,790 --> 00:04:16,150
All of that gets in the way of letting
the data tell you what's in the data.

66
00:04:16,870 --> 00:04:19,720
Okay? We need a way of letting
the data talk to itself.

67
00:04:20,650 --> 00:04:24,850
A DQC can do that.
So how is DQC different?

68
00:04:25,300 --> 00:04:28,330
This is the 30,000 foot view of it.

69
00:04:28,810 --> 00:04:32,160
We can return to it towards the end of
my talk if I don't run out of time when

70
00:04:32,161 --> 00:04:35,180
people let me talk over and that is uh,

71
00:04:35,470 --> 00:04:40,470
what DQC does is it uses the data
itself to create a proxy function,

72
00:04:42,730 --> 00:04:46,030
a function that is a proxy
for the density of the data.

73
00:04:46,060 --> 00:04:49,900
This function has the property
wherever there's locally more data,

74
00:04:49,901 --> 00:04:50,770
it has a minimum.

75
00:04:51,370 --> 00:04:56,370
If there's a region of dense data
along some curve it has a trough,

76
00:04:57,520 --> 00:04:58,120
which is,

77
00:04:58,120 --> 00:05:03,120
it has points of inflection in the car
basically once you've got this function,

78
00:05:04,181 --> 00:05:07,480
the next problem which occurs,
think of this as a topographical map.

79
00:05:07,481 --> 00:05:11,740
So I've drawn it in three dimensions
and the data is distributed.

80
00:05:11,740 --> 00:05:13,990
There are rivers in this map,

81
00:05:13,991 --> 00:05:18,991
river beds and the stream beds where
the data is more dense and of course

82
00:05:19,091 --> 00:05:23,980
because of fluctuations
in they just statistical
fluctuations, systematic errors,

83
00:05:24,310 --> 00:05:27,460
the data will be distributed up
along the banks of those streams.

84
00:05:28,180 --> 00:05:32,800
So the name of the game is we just let
everybody rolled downhill into the stream.

85
00:05:33,370 --> 00:05:37,120
The nearest point in the stream,
you will see a movie that does that.

86
00:05:37,121 --> 00:05:41,770
That is DQC is just the movie.
The analysis is the movie. Okay.

87
00:05:41,771 --> 00:05:44,620
And then, uh, the stream beds will appear.

88
00:05:44,650 --> 00:05:48,520
You'll have understood the structure
of density variation in the data.

89
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:51,430
And then if there's more data
at one end of the stream,

90
00:05:51,431 --> 00:05:55,000
then another things will slowly
flow downstream to the ocean.

91
00:05:55,780 --> 00:05:58,760
The whole movie telling
you stuff about the data,

92
00:05:58,761 --> 00:06:03,230
the time to reach the stream bed is
a measure of how far the data was.

93
00:06:03,230 --> 00:06:04,610
So just counting frames,

94
00:06:05,050 --> 00:06:09,130
you are able to get a measure on the data,
uh,

95
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:13,640
a metric on the data, which is how
far you are from the stream bed. Okay.

96
00:06:14,340 --> 00:06:19,310
Uh, there are three knows that defined
why DQC is really different. Okay.

97
00:06:19,311 --> 00:06:20,240
And why it's better,

98
00:06:20,241 --> 00:06:24,200
faster and cheaper if I were trying to
pitch you and sell you something. Okay.

99
00:06:24,710 --> 00:06:27,530
So first no hypotheses. I mean, you know,

100
00:06:27,531 --> 00:06:29,810
the typical thing when
somebody has a data project,

101
00:06:29,811 --> 00:06:31,700
they put a bunch of
smart people in a room.

102
00:06:32,090 --> 00:06:33,980
They yell at each other for several days.

103
00:06:34,280 --> 00:06:38,990
They come up with a hypothesis and then
they find out that hypothesis is wrong

104
00:06:38,991 --> 00:06:41,990
and they go back into the room and
they hate each other at the end of this

105
00:06:41,991 --> 00:06:46,790
process because they've been yelling at
each other. But it takes a lot of time.

106
00:06:46,791 --> 00:06:50,810
Analysts are expensive,
they're time is money and so,

107
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:54,980
but worse, a hypothesis biases
the result you can find.

108
00:06:55,490 --> 00:06:59,210
You've already gone in with an assumption
of what the data has to tell you.

109
00:06:59,810 --> 00:07:03,470
You don't want to do that. The other
thing is you don't clean the data.

110
00:07:03,590 --> 00:07:07,640
Now I've been warned and Google, I have
to be very careful about saying that,

111
00:07:07,641 --> 00:07:09,590
so I'll be careful a little bit.
Okay.

112
00:07:11,240 --> 00:07:13,520
The whole question of
cleaning data is a huge issue.

113
00:07:13,940 --> 00:07:17,960
There are many things you can do to data
including burning it that I can't fix.

114
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:23,750
Okay? Uh, but in the sense
that I only want your raw data.

115
00:07:24,470 --> 00:07:28,400
Okay? That's what I work
with. People ask me, you know,

116
00:07:28,460 --> 00:07:31,670
do you want the raw data or the process
data? And I said, I want the raw data.

117
00:07:31,671 --> 00:07:34,650
And the guy says to me, nobody
works with the raw data. It's like,

118
00:07:34,670 --> 00:07:38,630
I want the wrong data. I don't want
your fingerprints all over this data.

119
00:07:38,930 --> 00:07:42,020
You've already messed it up
as far as I'm concerned. Okay.

120
00:07:42,050 --> 00:07:45,200
So you don't preprocess
the data to remove noise.

121
00:07:45,530 --> 00:07:49,460
You don't process it to try to get out
systematic artifacts that you know about.

122
00:07:49,670 --> 00:07:51,980
You just live with them.
It'll be fine.

123
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:55,490
They'll take care of
themselves in the process. Uh,

124
00:07:56,360 --> 00:07:58,370
if the data's gap in columns,

125
00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:01,070
think of the data generically
is some big spreadsheet.

126
00:08:01,220 --> 00:08:03,740
If there are gaps in the columns,
I don't care.

127
00:08:04,070 --> 00:08:08,720
I have plenty of examples where gap
data work just fine. Okay. I mean,

128
00:08:08,721 --> 00:08:12,980
I'll put a minus one in for something
like that. Any kind of substitution,

129
00:08:12,981 --> 00:08:17,350
I needed a number in there, but it doesn't
have to be a sensible number. Okay. Uh,

130
00:08:17,960 --> 00:08:20,930
so if I don't have to clean my data,

131
00:08:20,931 --> 00:08:23,810
I've already saved the
gigantic amount of time. Okay.

132
00:08:23,900 --> 00:08:28,730
That's typically the place where an
enormous amount of time is wasted.

133
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,820
And then, I mean, I know
people where you say,

134
00:08:32,180 --> 00:08:35,450
first thing your analyst comes in and
says, well, we have to clean your data.

135
00:08:35,450 --> 00:08:37,640
And then he goes away for six months
and then it comes back and says,

136
00:08:37,641 --> 00:08:42,180
I couldn't clean your data. So the
project's over pay me. Okay? Uh,

137
00:08:42,290 --> 00:08:42,800
no.

138
00:08:42,800 --> 00:08:47,210
The analyst's time is money and you have
the danger again of throwing the baby

139
00:08:47,211 --> 00:08:49,730
out with the bath water.
If you don't know what you're looking for,

140
00:08:50,120 --> 00:08:53,480
starting to clean it means you're going
to throw away everything but what you

141
00:08:53,481 --> 00:08:54,830
think you might be interested in.

142
00:08:55,680 --> 00:08:59,730
And the third thing is you don't need
expert knowledge in the first stage of an

143
00:08:59,731 --> 00:09:03,480
analysis. That doesn't mean
subject matter experts are needed.

144
00:09:04,170 --> 00:09:09,090
It means you run the analysis,
you see what you see,

145
00:09:09,450 --> 00:09:12,330
and then you call them the
subject matter expert to say,

146
00:09:12,331 --> 00:09:16,500
what the hell am I seeing
over here? Okay? And so, uh,

147
00:09:17,340 --> 00:09:17,731
of course,

148
00:09:17,731 --> 00:09:21,180
subject matter experts or the most
expensive analysts you're going to find.

149
00:09:21,180 --> 00:09:24,360
So not wasting their time in
the beginning is a big deal.

150
00:09:25,470 --> 00:09:29,490
Here you see three analyses,
okay? Now this is fun,

151
00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:35,040
okay? This is one we completely
understand. This was done as an exercise.

152
00:09:35,041 --> 00:09:37,440
This is Sloan digital sky survey data.

153
00:09:37,860 --> 00:09:40,710
These are 350,000 galaxies.

154
00:09:40,711 --> 00:09:44,940
The coordinates are the angles theta
and Phi on the sky, and the red shift,

155
00:09:44,941 --> 00:09:49,500
meaning the distance of the galaxy from
us. You've read the New York Times,

156
00:09:49,501 --> 00:09:54,180
I hope most of you or else Facebook showed
it to you or something and they told

157
00:09:54,181 --> 00:09:55,014
you that

158
00:09:56,460 --> 00:09:59,340
galaxies are distributed in filaments.

159
00:09:59,341 --> 00:10:01,860
The elementary structure
of high density and voids.

160
00:10:02,730 --> 00:10:05,790
This shows you at the beginning.
It's not so easy to see.

161
00:10:05,970 --> 00:10:08,820
The way that's done is very
complicated and took a long time.

162
00:10:09,480 --> 00:10:12,660
This is DQC running on that data,
pulling the data,

163
00:10:12,690 --> 00:10:17,130
the galaxies back to the higher density
regions. That is the right answer.

164
00:10:17,490 --> 00:10:20,700
So number one, that's
impressive, but number two,

165
00:10:20,701 --> 00:10:25,320
what's more impressive is the structure
of what I'm showing you because I don't

166
00:10:25,321 --> 00:10:30,321
know of any other way to see a complex
interlocking structure of filaments like

167
00:10:30,781 --> 00:10:34,230
that. The real structure of the
data using any other cluster,

168
00:10:34,231 --> 00:10:38,970
the reality that's not
possible in my knowledge here.

169
00:10:38,971 --> 00:10:41,430
You're looking at data from
a hyperspectral camera.

170
00:10:41,910 --> 00:10:46,620
It starts out looking like a hairball
and it contracts to this extended

171
00:10:46,621 --> 00:10:50,760
structure of filaments. That's the kind
of thing I was telling you in this case.

172
00:10:50,761 --> 00:10:54,660
That stuff is related to things that
are really going on on the ground,

173
00:10:54,930 --> 00:10:55,763
on the ground.

174
00:10:56,010 --> 00:11:01,010
This is a picture of a quarry in upstate
New York and the camera is a Mega Patho

175
00:11:01,990 --> 00:11:06,600
megapixel camera that's taking a
frequency spectrum for the half a million

176
00:11:06,601 --> 00:11:10,080
pixels and 512 frequency.
So I have a half a million,

177
00:11:10,470 --> 00:11:12,780
512 dimensional pieces of data.

178
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:17,130
And the question is which ones
look more like one or nothing.

179
00:11:17,730 --> 00:11:22,560
Why is that interesting? Because light
is reflected from the ground. I suppose.

180
00:11:22,561 --> 00:11:25,860
I am the military,
which is not my favorite customer,

181
00:11:25,861 --> 00:11:30,390
but let's say I'm in the military and
I have a tank in a desert and has been

182
00:11:30,391 --> 00:11:33,390
camouflage to look like the sand.
Well,

183
00:11:33,420 --> 00:11:36,390
it's been camouflage to look like
the sand and the visible frequencies,

184
00:11:36,900 --> 00:11:39,450
but it doesn't look like the sand
and the nonvisible frequency.

185
00:11:39,451 --> 00:11:42,960
So if I look at who's
like one another and area,

186
00:11:42,961 --> 00:11:47,730
the shape of the tank will
appear in the data. Okay.

187
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:50,790
And it will be visible to
a hyperspectral camera,

188
00:11:50,791 --> 00:11:55,210
which can be mounted in a drone and
flown over area. So that's pretty cool.

189
00:11:55,430 --> 00:11:58,630
It's also have used the Coca
Cola and Pepsi Cola course.

190
00:11:58,631 --> 00:12:02,270
They're the biggest corn growers
in the world and they, uh,

191
00:12:02,890 --> 00:12:06,100
have huge fields of corn.
They need the high fructose corn syrup,

192
00:12:07,210 --> 00:12:11,510
which is killing us all. But
that's fine. This is business. And

193
00:12:13,660 --> 00:12:14,493
at any rate,

194
00:12:14,860 --> 00:12:19,860
this can find problems in the fields and
it can do it in a very effective way.

195
00:12:20,111 --> 00:12:24,670
So that's a cool thing about that. On
the very far left, there is cancer data.

196
00:12:24,671 --> 00:12:26,620
And that's what I want to
talk to you about today.

197
00:12:27,190 --> 00:12:29,140
And why do I want to talk to
you about the cancer data?

198
00:12:29,350 --> 00:12:32,980
Cancer is a problem that everybody
understands is a big deal.

199
00:12:33,190 --> 00:12:37,480
We've all lost people.
We love the cancer. Okay?

200
00:12:38,140 --> 00:12:41,110
Uh, you also all know
cancer is a hard problem.

201
00:12:41,860 --> 00:12:44,380
So if I show you stuff you
never knew about cancer data,

202
00:12:45,070 --> 00:12:48,910
I hope that impresses you, that we've seen
something that nobody has seen before.

203
00:12:48,940 --> 00:12:53,440
Okay? Uh, and so that will
be where the focus is.

204
00:12:53,441 --> 00:12:54,700
But before I do that,

205
00:12:54,701 --> 00:12:59,440
let me give you a little bit more
of the story of what you see.

206
00:13:00,040 --> 00:13:04,510
Okay. Because when you see the DQC
movie and something like that appears,

207
00:13:04,930 --> 00:13:09,010
this is sort of the, uh, the
progenitors of the zoo of shapes that,

208
00:13:09,011 --> 00:13:09,940
so up in the movie,

209
00:13:10,450 --> 00:13:14,020
if the data had little
regions on the left,

210
00:13:14,021 --> 00:13:18,340
which were obviously separable
clusters DQC we'll show you points.

211
00:13:18,850 --> 00:13:22,900
The points will be moved together
to the centroid of the region. Okay.

212
00:13:22,930 --> 00:13:26,920
If the data has something which,
let's say I, Ozzy would say, oh,

213
00:13:26,921 --> 00:13:28,840
that's a candidate for aggression.

214
00:13:28,841 --> 00:13:31,360
And then they call in their
favorite regressor and say,

215
00:13:31,690 --> 00:13:33,970
please give me a model for this data.

216
00:13:34,450 --> 00:13:39,310
DQC We'll show you the line that
it would have regressed them. Okay.

217
00:13:39,700 --> 00:13:40,091
And I'll,

218
00:13:40,091 --> 00:13:45,091
I'll show you how that could possibly
happen cause it seems strange and if there

219
00:13:45,371 --> 00:13:50,140
is a flare, which people talk about
places where the day to join showing you,

220
00:13:50,530 --> 00:13:54,340
oh, this has been going on this way for
a long time and then two different things

221
00:13:54,341 --> 00:13:59,341
can happen and the data ends up in
to slowly changing characteristics.

222
00:14:00,730 --> 00:14:04,570
Then DQC we'll show you that and
if you'll look carefully there,

223
00:14:04,600 --> 00:14:06,340
you're seeing it.
Okay.

224
00:14:06,430 --> 00:14:10,360
The flares are just completely
revealed and it happens automatically.

225
00:14:10,390 --> 00:14:14,800
You're not doing anything to extract
that from the data. DQC is doing that.

226
00:14:15,460 --> 00:14:17,890
And finally finding circles and things,

227
00:14:17,891 --> 00:14:20,860
which are the problems everybody likes
to talk about. It's a piece of cake.

228
00:14:20,861 --> 00:14:24,310
I don't care about it. Okay.
It happens when it happens.

229
00:14:25,720 --> 00:14:28,840
All right. What's automatic
regression? Cause that's a crazy idea.

230
00:14:28,870 --> 00:14:33,410
There is a posting on linkedin that I did,
which I called Turbo charging,

231
00:14:33,840 --> 00:14:36,910
uh, predictive analytics.
But what was it really about?

232
00:14:36,911 --> 00:14:41,911
It was really about how you could have
knocked 200 years off the discovery of

233
00:14:42,401 --> 00:14:47,170
the ideal gas law had you
had this technology. Okay.

234
00:14:47,740 --> 00:14:48,670
Why do I say that?

235
00:14:48,671 --> 00:14:52,850
Because Boyle and Charles 18 hundreds of,

236
00:14:52,851 --> 00:14:56,630
so they identify Boyle's
law in Charles's law.

237
00:14:56,660 --> 00:14:59,210
They're looking either at
how p and V are related.

238
00:14:59,390 --> 00:15:01,910
If you hold teeth fixed
or p and t are related,

239
00:15:01,911 --> 00:15:06,560
if you hold the fixed and
then it's 200 years later,

240
00:15:06,650 --> 00:15:10,220
the Corinthia Dory Says No,
no p Times v is Tate.

241
00:15:11,330 --> 00:15:12,020
Okay.

242
00:15:12,020 --> 00:15:16,310
And getting all that put together and
dealing with the statistical problems in

243
00:15:16,311 --> 00:15:19,070
the data and everything else.
It's a huge problem.

244
00:15:19,071 --> 00:15:22,100
So I did this as a fun exercise.
I said,

245
00:15:22,101 --> 00:15:27,101
suppose I generate 6,000 independent
values of p and V and then calculate t and

246
00:15:28,821 --> 00:15:32,690
if I was able to plot in three
dimensions few hundred years ago,

247
00:15:33,470 --> 00:15:37,580
then I would have seen something that
looks a lot like the red surface there.

248
00:15:37,730 --> 00:15:39,400
I can tell you what that red surfaces,

249
00:15:39,410 --> 00:15:42,950
it's a messed up version of
what I would have seen. Now.

250
00:15:42,980 --> 00:15:47,600
That would be cool because once you see
a two dimensional surface, you finished,

251
00:15:47,630 --> 00:15:48,200
you've said,

252
00:15:48,200 --> 00:15:53,200
oh there's a law of physics because
not everyone is a law of physics.

253
00:15:53,940 --> 00:15:55,700
If I'm now teaching in my class.
Right.

254
00:15:56,120 --> 00:16:01,120
A Law of physics is the statement that
not everything you can measure about a

255
00:16:01,291 --> 00:16:04,880
system is independent.
If you know some of the variables,

256
00:16:04,910 --> 00:16:08,420
you can predict the other ones.
That's what gives you control.

257
00:16:08,660 --> 00:16:13,130
That's what lets you make refrigerators.
Okay. Had they just had the surface,

258
00:16:13,610 --> 00:16:17,090
they would have been in the position to
start the engineering program to build

259
00:16:17,091 --> 00:16:20,900
the first refrigerator. Okay?
That's all they needed. Okay,

260
00:16:21,350 --> 00:16:25,640
so you don't need the formula yet.
The surface a look up table,

261
00:16:26,360 --> 00:16:29,660
you know, if you were my age, you would
remember when science and co-signs,

262
00:16:29,780 --> 00:16:31,430
we're not cotton at the computer,

263
00:16:32,090 --> 00:16:36,560
but you actually went to look at tables
of signed some coast signs and then you

264
00:16:36,561 --> 00:16:40,280
interpolated the values to get
the number. You want it. Okay?

265
00:16:40,520 --> 00:16:43,010
So here you would have
seen that right away,

266
00:16:43,011 --> 00:16:45,200
all of that power would
be at your disposal.

267
00:16:45,620 --> 00:16:48,980
The problem is data is never that good.
Data is messy.

268
00:16:48,981 --> 00:16:51,320
So what I did was I took
down 6,000 points in,

269
00:16:51,321 --> 00:16:56,321
generated another 66,000 points by taking
each PV and t value and multiplying it

270
00:16:57,861 --> 00:17:02,861
by a number chosen from three independent
random distribution centered at one

271
00:17:04,100 --> 00:17:05,750
with a width of about 0.1.

272
00:17:05,751 --> 00:17:10,730
So this 10% error is roughly in that data
and the fuzzy blue surface is what you

273
00:17:10,731 --> 00:17:15,680
see. Now what's true if it is actually
an underlying surface in the data,

274
00:17:15,681 --> 00:17:18,650
and I messed it up that way,
that random distributions,

275
00:17:19,040 --> 00:17:21,050
the high density region is the surface.

276
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:27,640
So what you're seeing is DQC coalescing
the data down onto the nearest high

277
00:17:27,951 --> 00:17:32,810
density region, which is the surface and
then it buries itself in the surface.

278
00:17:33,050 --> 00:17:35,210
Now it buries itself in the red surface.

279
00:17:35,630 --> 00:17:40,630
The red surface is the best answer I
could have gotten because I took every 12

280
00:17:40,731 --> 00:17:44,390
points that I had generated from a
single point and I averaged them.

281
00:17:45,020 --> 00:17:48,080
And because of course I have
a small set of statistics,

282
00:17:48,560 --> 00:17:51,210
the mean isn't the surface,
it's a little bit thing.

283
00:17:51,211 --> 00:17:54,990
So that bread surfers shows you the
degree to which the data is messed up,

284
00:17:55,500 --> 00:17:57,450
which would have been
improved by having more data.

285
00:17:58,050 --> 00:18:01,470
And then the only question is why is it
pulling away from the edge in the later

286
00:18:01,471 --> 00:18:04,170
frames? By the way, you're
looking at a thousand frames.

287
00:18:04,260 --> 00:18:08,400
All of the interesting Cathy happens in
the first 60 then the thing stops moving.

288
00:18:08,940 --> 00:18:13,500
Why did it stop moving? Because the
central region has roughly equal density.

289
00:18:14,250 --> 00:18:18,360
And so DQC has no reason to move
the points around anymore. Okay?

290
00:18:18,540 --> 00:18:23,460
It's pulling away from the edges for the
same reason the proxy function goes up

291
00:18:23,461 --> 00:18:24,960
where there's no data sharply.

292
00:18:25,560 --> 00:18:30,000
And so data that's out in that region
rolls down and pulls in from the surface

293
00:18:30,001 --> 00:18:34,440
and then looks around and says, oh, no
problem. I'll stop right here. Okay.

294
00:18:34,860 --> 00:18:37,230
So that's what I mean
by automatic regression.

295
00:18:37,231 --> 00:18:39,690
So that means basically
if there are formulas,

296
00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:44,130
unknown relations hidden in your data,
what will the QC do?

297
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:47,820
It'll regress the stuff
automatically to the formula.

298
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:52,740
Then if there's a variation
in the distribution of the
data, it'll slowly change.

299
00:18:53,220 --> 00:18:56,370
That's why the whole movie matters.
First.

300
00:18:56,371 --> 00:19:00,690
You see the stuff happen and then it'll
slowly change in response to small

301
00:19:00,691 --> 00:19:03,510
variations.
All right,

302
00:19:03,720 --> 00:19:07,950
so now I'm going to go to cancer data and
I'm going to try to finish this all in

303
00:19:07,951 --> 00:19:12,280
the requisite amount of
time. So basically, uh,

304
00:19:12,390 --> 00:19:15,090
this is a problem where,
uh,

305
00:19:15,960 --> 00:19:18,990
I gave a talk at Seti and uh,

306
00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:24,870
someone who shall remain nameless in the
audience noticed that this was sort of

307
00:19:24,871 --> 00:19:26,700
interesting.
And he said,

308
00:19:26,701 --> 00:19:30,660
I have a biologist friend who would love
to talk to you about this and it's on

309
00:19:30,661 --> 00:19:31,471
the end. He said, well,

310
00:19:31,471 --> 00:19:34,890
this is a really great idea and I'd like
to do stuff with you and collaborate.

311
00:19:34,891 --> 00:19:39,000
But first,
in order to have my clients believe you,

312
00:19:39,001 --> 00:19:42,660
we need to do a problem that biologists
will understand. I said, fine.

313
00:19:43,350 --> 00:19:48,350
So he went to an Nih database that
had 25,000 tumors in it and uh,

314
00:19:49,680 --> 00:19:54,170
it had all kinds of DNA sequence
information. It had MRN,

315
00:19:54,180 --> 00:19:58,650
a expression information for each tumor
and a whole bunch of other things.

316
00:19:58,651 --> 00:20:03,651
He pulled out 10% of that data and they
were five different kinds of tumors.

317
00:20:04,380 --> 00:20:07,470
There was a bladder cancer,
Glioblastoma,

318
00:20:07,471 --> 00:20:10,800
multiforme or we all know what that is
now cost. That's what John Mccain has.

319
00:20:11,430 --> 00:20:13,470
Okay.
Low Grade Gliomas,

320
00:20:13,471 --> 00:20:17,670
which are same cell but a
much less serious cancer.

321
00:20:18,540 --> 00:20:21,660
They're all serious ovarian
cancer and thyroid cancer.

322
00:20:21,870 --> 00:20:25,500
The colors on the left are the
colors I colored the data with.

323
00:20:25,770 --> 00:20:29,550
So he would see it. You're looking
at, well, when I first did this,

324
00:20:29,551 --> 00:20:34,551
I did the Svd de composition for
the 73,800 MRN a jeans I was given.

325
00:20:35,820 --> 00:20:39,150
Okay. And I saw that
shape, I clustered it,

326
00:20:39,990 --> 00:20:43,320
saw that the cancer
separated in an obvious way.

327
00:20:43,321 --> 00:20:47,740
And from that DQC has an algorithm for
pulling out the most important genes for

328
00:20:47,741 --> 00:20:49,990
that shape.
Having done that,

329
00:20:49,991 --> 00:20:54,040
what you're seeing there is exactly
the same starting point, uh,

330
00:20:54,041 --> 00:20:59,041
but for only the 48 genes that were
identified as important and basically what

331
00:20:59,591 --> 00:21:03,730
do you see? You immediately see the
brain cancer separate like crazy.

332
00:21:04,510 --> 00:21:09,010
The glioblastoma multiforme is very
different from the low grade Gliomas,

333
00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:12,220
the thyroid cancers cluster,

334
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:16,240
but they don't call as to
a single disease. I mean,

335
00:21:16,241 --> 00:21:20,350
remember the colors are a histologist
looked at the cell and said,

336
00:21:20,710 --> 00:21:24,310
this is thyroid cancer. And
I'm telling you, no, it's not.

337
00:21:25,210 --> 00:21:26,980
These are all different thyroid cancers.

338
00:21:27,790 --> 00:21:32,590
If I had sensitivity
information to specific drugs,

339
00:21:32,591 --> 00:21:37,330
all I have to do is recolor that plot.
And I say, well, yeah, it's true.

340
00:21:37,331 --> 00:21:39,610
Your drug doesn't cure
everybody's thyroid cancer,

341
00:21:40,060 --> 00:21:43,600
but it cures these siree
cancers 100% of the time. Okay.

342
00:21:43,870 --> 00:21:48,870
This is the beginning of meeting
the promise of precision medicine.

343
00:21:49,420 --> 00:21:54,040
Okay. When you can see that these
things are not single diseases. Okay,

344
00:21:56,290 --> 00:21:57,580
sure.
I like questions.

345
00:22:00,120 --> 00:22:05,030
They're SVD axes. Okay. They're linear
combinations of genes, okay. Uh,

346
00:22:05,140 --> 00:22:06,640
that doesn't mean
anything. I mean, I can't,

347
00:22:06,670 --> 00:22:11,650
I every point is identifiable all the
time as a particular point in the original

348
00:22:11,690 --> 00:22:14,290
Dataset.
So we can reach in and say,

349
00:22:14,291 --> 00:22:18,790
I want to know about these guys and I'll
pull out the raw data for you instantly.

350
00:22:24,330 --> 00:22:29,320
Sved sved is the Swiss army knife of
all this stuff and I'm bringing coals to

351
00:22:29,321 --> 00:22:31,900
Newcastle, but I'll say it anyway. Um,

352
00:22:32,860 --> 00:22:36,040
all it's doing is finding a good set
of coordinates, the plot, the data,

353
00:22:36,041 --> 00:22:39,010
the first three dimensions of the ones
in which the data has the biggest that

354
00:22:39,011 --> 00:22:42,370
extent, the next three. It has less you,

355
00:22:42,460 --> 00:22:47,290
if you look at that at the beginning,
there's no separation between these guys.

356
00:22:47,980 --> 00:22:48,121
They're,

357
00:22:48,121 --> 00:22:52,840
the separation occurs very quickly because
not of what's going on in the first

358
00:22:52,841 --> 00:22:56,920
three dimensions, but what's going
on in the other 48 to see everything.

359
00:22:56,920 --> 00:23:01,210
We're searing here, all 48
genes and playing a role, okay?

360
00:23:01,570 --> 00:23:05,200
The reason these guys separate so fast
and it looks so different from everybody

361
00:23:05,201 --> 00:23:07,330
else's, when you reach in
and pull out the clusters,

362
00:23:07,780 --> 00:23:10,060
you find out instead
of expressing 48 genes,

363
00:23:10,061 --> 00:23:13,540
they only express 24 48 dimensions.

364
00:23:13,541 --> 00:23:17,410
They live in a different place and
that's reflected in the clustering in the

365
00:23:17,411 --> 00:23:21,660
first three dimensions, okay?
So yes, if I wanted a bore,

366
00:23:21,661 --> 00:23:24,610
you have silly or maybe excite you,
but run out of time,

367
00:23:24,640 --> 00:23:26,830
I could plot all 48 dimensions for you,

368
00:23:26,831 --> 00:23:29,440
but you're seeing
basically what's going on.

369
00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:35,110
What I want to focus you on is the
red guys and the ovarian cancer guys.

370
00:23:35,111 --> 00:23:37,600
The cyan guys are not moving very much,

371
00:23:38,290 --> 00:23:40,420
and the first question
you'd like me to answer,

372
00:23:40,421 --> 00:23:43,090
I hope is why aren't they moving at all?

373
00:23:43,091 --> 00:23:45,650
They look like they're so close together.
Well,

374
00:23:45,651 --> 00:23:49,220
they're not close together
and 48 dimensions. That's
why they're very different.

375
00:23:49,310 --> 00:23:52,490
Okay. However, let's, uh,

376
00:23:52,550 --> 00:23:55,340
the first question you would have asked,
right,

377
00:23:55,850 --> 00:24:00,530
is what happens if you pull
48 random genes out? Okay.

378
00:24:00,560 --> 00:24:04,190
And do the same game,
2,400 tumors, random genes.

379
00:24:05,840 --> 00:24:08,510
That's what happens. I don't know
if you noticed it. Let's go back.

380
00:24:09,470 --> 00:24:12,530
Look very careful at the evolution.
It's about 10 frames,

381
00:24:12,540 --> 00:24:17,090
emotion and then it all stops.
Random data always does that.

382
00:24:18,380 --> 00:24:21,860
Random data doesn't cluster
in any significant way.

383
00:24:22,310 --> 00:24:26,570
That is what DQC shows you when
there's nothing to look at in the data.

384
00:24:26,930 --> 00:24:30,140
So this is not random genes
that are going to do the job.

385
00:24:30,440 --> 00:24:34,950
That doesn't mean there's not something
amazing going on in a lot of jeans. Okay?

386
00:24:35,630 --> 00:24:39,680
Here, just to show you what you can do
with the data once you have the evolution.

387
00:24:39,740 --> 00:24:42,890
This, because I was challenged,
somebody said, well,

388
00:24:42,891 --> 00:24:47,480
you have to tell people what the gold
standard is doing on this date as how the

389
00:24:47,481 --> 00:24:48,740
gold points you see there.

390
00:24:48,740 --> 00:24:53,740
Cause it's the gold standard is t SNI
HDB scan when applied to this data,

391
00:24:53,751 --> 00:24:57,950
it finds brain cancer.
But if you look carefully,

392
00:24:57,951 --> 00:25:02,210
it finds equal amounts of
cluster in the Glioblastoma.

393
00:25:02,211 --> 00:25:05,420
Multiforme or,
and in the low grade Gliomas,

394
00:25:05,450 --> 00:25:09,350
it's not distinguishing glial
cell cancers, one from the other.

395
00:25:10,190 --> 00:25:13,340
Okay. And that's true of every
cluster that HDB scan finds.

396
00:25:13,790 --> 00:25:18,050
So HDB scan can tell thyroid,
it can tell ovarian,

397
00:25:18,440 --> 00:25:21,920
but it can't tell apart the
brain cancers it fails on them.

398
00:25:22,310 --> 00:25:26,870
And there's a reason, some of which we
understand for why that's happening.

399
00:25:26,900 --> 00:25:29,630
And it'll happen in a lot
of data sets like this.

400
00:25:30,200 --> 00:25:34,070
And the reason is there's much more than
one thing happening in this dataset and

401
00:25:34,071 --> 00:25:36,980
we have to be able to go through and pull
out all the different things that are

402
00:25:36,981 --> 00:25:39,380
happening. Okay. But as you see,

403
00:25:40,040 --> 00:25:42,230
the competition doesn't
do too well on this,

404
00:25:42,530 --> 00:25:47,530
whereas DQC separates the glial
cancers immediately from one another.

405
00:25:47,900 --> 00:25:49,130
They really are very different.

406
00:25:49,340 --> 00:25:52,880
If you average energy and expression and
compare them, they're very different.

407
00:25:53,390 --> 00:25:57,680
Okay. These are different diseases.
However, the thing you should notice,

408
00:25:57,681 --> 00:26:00,920
cause it's sort of fun and stuff about it,

409
00:26:00,921 --> 00:26:05,720
will be in the paper as it forms
to begin with. You see an arch,

410
00:26:07,110 --> 00:26:08,390
their intermediate frames.

411
00:26:08,391 --> 00:26:12,800
The first thing that happened is there's
a stream bed in which you see a low

412
00:26:12,801 --> 00:26:17,270
dimension structure that interpolate
between Glioblastoma multiforme and low

413
00:26:17,271 --> 00:26:20,720
grade Glioma.
Understanding that could be very,

414
00:26:20,930 --> 00:26:23,300
very important in treatment.
Okay.

415
00:26:23,480 --> 00:26:27,050
Why is it important that in the
beginning of the GLIOBLASTOMAS extended?

416
00:26:28,010 --> 00:26:30,050
I know this from personal sad experience.

417
00:26:30,051 --> 00:26:35,051
My first wife died of
Glioblastoma multiforme and
before at the stage where John

418
00:26:37,340 --> 00:26:39,740
Mccain is now, the doctors come
to you and give you a choice.

419
00:26:40,280 --> 00:26:45,270
They say the choices, are
you going to have radiation
or not have radiation? Well,

420
00:26:45,271 --> 00:26:49,530
it turns out Glioblastoma multiforme
or can go one of two ways.

421
00:26:49,531 --> 00:26:51,000
When confronted with radiation,

422
00:26:51,300 --> 00:26:56,070
it can become much more malignant
or it can get a little bit better.

423
00:26:57,210 --> 00:27:01,230
We ended up in the bad side of that day,
but nobody knows how to tell them apart,

424
00:27:01,530 --> 00:27:04,500
but since initially this
is an extended structure,

425
00:27:04,980 --> 00:27:08,850
the hope would be if we had the radiation
information, we could give advice.

426
00:27:09,240 --> 00:27:12,990
Are you a candidate for radiation or
you're not a candidate for radiation

427
00:27:13,290 --> 00:27:15,870
because that's also not
completely one disease.

428
00:27:17,160 --> 00:27:19,980
There's just a few other
little things that we know.

429
00:27:20,700 --> 00:27:22,830
We know something about
the age of the patient.

430
00:27:22,860 --> 00:27:27,120
I have no information about uh,
their response to the drugs.

431
00:27:27,150 --> 00:27:29,940
And I have no information about
their response to radiation,

432
00:27:30,420 --> 00:27:33,600
but the Datasat has age.
So always in these plots,

433
00:27:33,810 --> 00:27:37,920
the left hand side is the original
analysis colored by diagnosis,

434
00:27:38,520 --> 00:27:41,820
the right hand thing,
the red points are people over 40.

435
00:27:42,570 --> 00:27:46,140
The blue points are people under 40.

436
00:27:46,680 --> 00:27:49,860
Maybe somebody is equal to
40. I don't know. At any rate,

437
00:27:50,250 --> 00:27:55,250
the interesting thing is the Glioblastoma
multiforme is mostly people over 40.

438
00:27:56,400 --> 00:28:01,080
The low grade gliomas in this dataset
or mostly people under 40. Okay.

439
00:28:01,500 --> 00:28:03,060
If we look out here,

440
00:28:04,800 --> 00:28:07,090
remember these guys didn't cluster well.
Well,

441
00:28:07,091 --> 00:28:11,700
there's a reason these guys over
here are red are older people.

442
00:28:12,040 --> 00:28:15,720
There are tumors. I mean why are older
people interesting? As you get older,

443
00:28:15,930 --> 00:28:17,880
the errors in your genome crop up,

444
00:28:17,910 --> 00:28:22,910
the MRAA expression will become more
random and therefore they should not look

445
00:28:23,101 --> 00:28:27,000
like younger people even for the
same quote disease. They don't.

446
00:28:27,480 --> 00:28:31,500
And so the reason these guys don't
coalesce and the blue ones do is the blue

447
00:28:31,501 --> 00:28:35,880
ones are younger people with a less messed
up genome but still big variation in

448
00:28:35,881 --> 00:28:39,470
the genome.
The only other piece I have is the the uh,

449
00:28:40,800 --> 00:28:45,510
stage of the cancer. Okay. Cancer
is a stage one, two, three, four,

450
00:28:45,511 --> 00:28:49,110
four, a four B. Okay. On this plot,

451
00:28:50,070 --> 00:28:54,270
the stage three and four
cancers a yellow and red.

452
00:28:54,510 --> 00:28:56,690
So it's always the same movie.
Oh,

453
00:28:56,700 --> 00:29:00,450
I've done has changed the
coloring according to the
information that I have from

454
00:29:00,451 --> 00:29:02,280
sources that have nothing
to do with the genome.

455
00:29:02,970 --> 00:29:05,160
Well apparently I have
nothing to do with the genome.

456
00:29:05,700 --> 00:29:10,700
And you notice the guys that I told
you where the red and the scion,

457
00:29:11,041 --> 00:29:13,440
they ovarian,
they don't move well.

458
00:29:13,441 --> 00:29:17,010
They also are the ones that are higher
stage cancers more messed up genomes.

459
00:29:17,370 --> 00:29:20,820
You expect them to be different
in 48 dimensions and they are,

460
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:25,170
they don't cluster. These guys
do. And this edge out here,

461
00:29:25,770 --> 00:29:28,500
the yellow ones are there they are again,

462
00:29:28,501 --> 00:29:32,550
the more messed up genomes and they
shouldn't cluster with the blue ones and

463
00:29:32,551 --> 00:29:33,384
they don't.

464
00:29:33,480 --> 00:29:38,370
So this is how you just work your way
through the analysis at the first stage.

465
00:29:39,330 --> 00:29:42,400
Okay. But then the question
comes up, what happens? I mean,

466
00:29:42,401 --> 00:29:45,430
I'm just trying to lead you right
through the questions as they appear.

467
00:29:46,030 --> 00:29:49,870
What happens if I take these 48
genes out? I do. I see anything.

468
00:29:50,830 --> 00:29:52,570
Okay.
Do you want to vote?

469
00:29:55,540 --> 00:29:59,260
Somebody wanted to take a guess.
How am I going to see something?

470
00:29:59,261 --> 00:30:03,640
Am I going to see Confetti? I'm
I going to see a mess. All right.

471
00:30:03,670 --> 00:30:08,170
Nobody wants to guess. That's
what I see. Okay. Stunning.

472
00:30:08,920 --> 00:30:12,430
A totally different shape has appeared.
The 48 genes are out.

473
00:30:12,460 --> 00:30:14,920
They were the most dominant ones.
And defining the shape,

474
00:30:15,520 --> 00:30:20,000
it doesn't mean that went away.
There's another shape. Okay.

475
00:30:20,390 --> 00:30:23,390
And here's where I get my comeuppance.
So I'll tell you about it. Okay.

476
00:30:23,870 --> 00:30:26,780
I looked at this and I said,
oh look, that's pretty good.

477
00:30:27,380 --> 00:30:31,340
I think what I'm seeing,
because these are not really separated,

478
00:30:31,760 --> 00:30:36,380
what I'm seeing, and I said this to my
colleague, Alex felt this, uh, that,

479
00:30:36,550 --> 00:30:39,050
um,
I'm seeing the,

480
00:30:39,051 --> 00:30:43,100
the ordinary behavior of healthy cells.

481
00:30:43,640 --> 00:30:46,100
And Alex said, I don't
believe that. He said,

482
00:30:46,101 --> 00:30:51,101
I believe what we're seeing is that cancer
infiltrates the cell and hijacks the

483
00:30:52,611 --> 00:30:54,270
cellular machinery and leaves,

484
00:30:54,280 --> 00:30:59,030
fingerprints all over the gene expression
of the rest of the genes in the system.

485
00:31:00,050 --> 00:31:04,520
And I said, that's ridiculous. I know that
the way that thing is going to cluster,

486
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:08,570
here's the Glioblastoma and the others
are going to be the same cluster.

487
00:31:09,230 --> 00:31:11,300
I have a lot of experience
running this stuff.

488
00:31:11,930 --> 00:31:16,520
You should never say you understand
that 48 dimensions later,

489
00:31:17,760 --> 00:31:22,610
the Glioblastoma and the low grade
glioma separate from one another.

490
00:31:22,610 --> 00:31:27,020
Beautifully. He's right. I'm wrong. I
had a great day. I love being wrong.

491
00:31:27,770 --> 00:31:32,060
So if I look down here in dimensions four,
five and six,

492
00:31:32,061 --> 00:31:33,320
this is what I was telling you.

493
00:31:33,560 --> 00:31:38,240
The red guys live in an entirely different
place from the same guys. So in fact,

494
00:31:38,480 --> 00:31:42,560
we just found out ovarian cancer is
not dark. It's not bladder cancer.

495
00:31:43,200 --> 00:31:47,510
But it takes other dimensions
to see that fact. Okay?

496
00:31:47,900 --> 00:31:52,460
So, uh, it's just dangerous to guests. I
don't care how much experience you've had.

497
00:31:52,461 --> 00:31:55,220
The good thing is I can put
all the bias I want it to.

498
00:31:55,221 --> 00:31:58,460
What I think is going to happen.
TQC does what it wants.

499
00:32:00,150 --> 00:32:04,760
That's what it did. That's what we saw.
That was the end of the story. All right,

500
00:32:04,761 --> 00:32:09,440
so we're at, I'm told I have
like 10 minutes left. Uh,

501
00:32:09,590 --> 00:32:12,050
is that about right?
I promised

502
00:32:14,100 --> 00:32:18,840
John that I would pull back the curtain
a little bit on the quantum mechanics.

503
00:32:18,841 --> 00:32:23,520
That means half of you should
go to sleep. Okay. Okay.

504
00:32:24,360 --> 00:32:28,500
Uh, I'm sorry about that. Uh, the,
I didn't do this to you. Blame him.

505
00:32:29,460 --> 00:32:30,630
Okay.
Uh,

506
00:32:34,080 --> 00:32:39,000
what do I first want to emphasize
quantum mechanics in? This is a trick.

507
00:32:39,530 --> 00:32:44,530
I am abusing what I know about quantum
theory to do a problem that should be

508
00:32:45,531 --> 00:32:50,360
done classically, but it wouldn't be
computable if it was done. Classically,

509
00:32:50,810 --> 00:32:54,410
I need an approach,
which is immensely paralyzable.

510
00:32:54,740 --> 00:32:57,890
If I have to do gradient descent to
move things down the cliff and there's

511
00:32:58,130 --> 00:33:01,550
millions of points and
hundreds of dimensions.

512
00:33:01,850 --> 00:33:04,910
I don't know how many of you have done
gradient descent while you do in machine

513
00:33:04,911 --> 00:33:07,460
learning. So, uh, in fact, you know,

514
00:33:08,150 --> 00:33:13,150
not so easy to find 800 minima
and characterize their shape.

515
00:33:14,180 --> 00:33:17,000
Okay,
in 500 dimensions.

516
00:33:17,150 --> 00:33:21,110
So we need something else we need as the
person who taught me quantum mechanics,

517
00:33:21,111 --> 00:33:25,700
Bob server would say we need a trick
and in this case the trick is quantum

518
00:33:25,701 --> 00:33:29,120
mechanics. Okay, now do.

519
00:33:29,121 --> 00:33:32,510
I said we're going to create a function
that's a proxy for the density of the

520
00:33:32,511 --> 00:33:34,340
data and we're going to
do that for two reasons.

521
00:33:34,730 --> 00:33:38,570
Then we're going to move the points. Okay,
I'm going to move ahead a little bit.

522
00:33:38,960 --> 00:33:43,400
So here is what the manual Parson
and infinite long time ago,

523
00:33:43,401 --> 00:33:48,401
but had you read basic books on data
mining or statistical analysis you would

524
00:33:49,341 --> 00:33:53,630
have found at Parson in fact invented
something called the Parson estimator.

525
00:33:53,631 --> 00:33:56,180
He said,
for each data point in n dimensions,

526
00:33:56,600 --> 00:33:59,510
I'll write a Gaussian a Belker.

527
00:34:00,200 --> 00:34:03,800
I'll add them all up and I'll have a
function and where there's more data,

528
00:34:03,801 --> 00:34:07,670
I should have a maximum and was less data.
I should have a minimum.

529
00:34:08,180 --> 00:34:09,920
The problem is what you see here,

530
00:34:09,921 --> 00:34:14,360
the one parameter and the Gaussian
Gamma varies by a few percent,

531
00:34:14,450 --> 00:34:18,710
and what you see in terms of
maximum minima changes dramatically.

532
00:34:19,130 --> 00:34:23,330
The function is exquisitely
sensitive to parameters anyway,

533
00:34:23,331 --> 00:34:28,331
characterizing lots of Maxima in a
function in n dimensions is very,

534
00:34:29,931 --> 00:34:33,380
very difficult.
So the first step that faced us was,

535
00:34:33,381 --> 00:34:38,381
how do we keep this idea but change what
we do so that the function we have is

536
00:34:40,101 --> 00:34:42,320
not sensitive to changes the parameters.

537
00:34:42,320 --> 00:34:47,000
You can change parameters by 20%
and you'll see the same structure.

538
00:34:47,390 --> 00:34:50,450
Okay? This function has
a lot of Nice properties.

539
00:34:50,480 --> 00:34:52,580
The first of it is it's
positive everywhere.

540
00:34:52,670 --> 00:34:57,670
It's either a zero or positive that makes
it a candidate for an Eigen function

541
00:34:57,770 --> 00:35:02,030
of a problem in quantum mechanics.
Now, if you're a physicist like me,

542
00:35:02,031 --> 00:35:04,490
you know that problems
in quantum mechanics,

543
00:35:04,491 --> 00:35:09,200
when you find the eigen functions of a
potential of the force law for what's

544
00:35:09,201 --> 00:35:10,340
going on in the problem,

545
00:35:10,790 --> 00:35:15,290
wherever there is a maximum in the
function or wherever there's a minimum and

546
00:35:15,291 --> 00:35:19,700
the potential, there'll be a small
maximum of the eigen function.

547
00:35:20,300 --> 00:35:24,110
Okay? Or a point of inflection
if the parameters are chosen.

548
00:35:25,010 --> 00:35:29,600
But the underlying potential will be
much more stable representation of what's

549
00:35:29,601 --> 00:35:34,550
going on. Cause the reason
for those little maxima is
the uncertainty principle.

550
00:35:35,060 --> 00:35:37,890
It's the kinetic term in that problem,

551
00:35:38,190 --> 00:35:42,660
which is washing out the details.
So we just faced with a problem.

552
00:35:43,350 --> 00:35:47,920
We want to solve the Schrodinger
equation, Dell squared, Psi Plus v Time,

553
00:35:47,921 --> 00:35:51,510
PSI equals. It can be anything.
So zero is perfectly good.

554
00:35:52,080 --> 00:35:53,730
That's a difference of a constant in the,

555
00:35:54,330 --> 00:35:59,280
and we just want to find the PSI.
We know it's a sum of Gaussians,

556
00:35:59,580 --> 00:36:01,680
Dell squared, cy, we know how to compute.

557
00:36:02,040 --> 00:36:05,070
It's a sum of calciums
multiplied by Paloma polynomials.

558
00:36:07,110 --> 00:36:11,040
The even I can do this problem
and I'm not great at math. Okay,

559
00:36:11,250 --> 00:36:14,910
I take this guy and I move them
over here and I divide by this guy.

560
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:19,200
And that's v okay, that's, that's
the way we solve the problem.

561
00:36:19,201 --> 00:36:22,140
So now we have an analytic form
for the potential function.

562
00:36:22,770 --> 00:36:26,700
We don't want to have to work with
it, but it's a great form. Okay,

563
00:36:27,540 --> 00:36:32,540
so from that here I have three
Gaussians and 20% variations.

564
00:36:32,731 --> 00:36:36,960
The red curve is the potential function.

565
00:36:36,961 --> 00:36:41,460
The green curve is the way
function. Sigh. Okay. Notice

566
00:36:43,040 --> 00:36:43,710
the gas,

567
00:36:43,710 --> 00:36:48,710
the potential function has very sharp
features even when the Parson estimator

568
00:36:50,251 --> 00:36:51,900
has essentially no features.

569
00:36:52,410 --> 00:36:56,340
So you can run through a huge range
of parameters and nothing changes.

570
00:36:56,341 --> 00:36:57,750
You'll find the same set of minimum.

571
00:36:58,350 --> 00:37:03,000
Here we're looking at two very eight
three very asymmetrical distribution's

572
00:37:03,420 --> 00:37:06,870
different numbers of points
with as the parameters very,

573
00:37:07,320 --> 00:37:12,320
and again this guy is vanishing when this
guy has enormously large features that

574
00:37:13,531 --> 00:37:17,640
we can exercise off. So I've made my
function. I had done what I promised you.

575
00:37:17,641 --> 00:37:22,350
I made my function immensely
insensitive to parameters. Okay.

576
00:37:22,860 --> 00:37:25,530
And I've made it minima instead of Maxima,

577
00:37:25,800 --> 00:37:30,000
which is also cool cause with minimum
I can just do gradient descent and find

578
00:37:30,001 --> 00:37:33,450
them. I can do gradient us sent, but
that's even worse than gradient decent.

579
00:37:34,920 --> 00:37:37,830
This is how funny it can be.
Okay,

580
00:37:38,370 --> 00:37:43,370
this is a 10% or 20% I can't
a 20% variation and I'm
showing you going from no

581
00:37:45,721 --> 00:37:48,330
visible features to
what is apparently flat.

582
00:37:48,780 --> 00:37:53,040
The potential function has the structure
we were looking for and the original

583
00:37:53,041 --> 00:37:55,770
function can't see anything.

584
00:37:55,950 --> 00:37:58,560
You wouldn't be able to make
any money off that function.

585
00:37:59,790 --> 00:38:02,090
So I hope I've convinced you.

586
00:38:02,110 --> 00:38:06,480
Now we've got a good candidate
for a proxy for density.

587
00:38:07,740 --> 00:38:10,590
Now we just have to run guys
downhill as I promised you.

588
00:38:10,591 --> 00:38:14,880
I want to move the points for that. I'll
give you a name. I didn't write it down,

589
00:38:15,210 --> 00:38:19,050
so everybody take out your book.
What I'm going to use as Erin fests,

590
00:38:20,050 --> 00:38:21,600
Erin fests theorem says,

591
00:38:21,601 --> 00:38:26,520
if I have a Gaussian sitting in a
potential and I evolve it using the

592
00:38:26,521 --> 00:38:30,030
Hamiltonian, solve the Schrodinger
equation for the motion of that Gaussian,

593
00:38:30,630 --> 00:38:34,230
the center of the Gaussian will move
according to Newton's laws and the

594
00:38:34,231 --> 00:38:37,510
potential. If I don't go too far, okay?

595
00:38:37,840 --> 00:38:41,050
That's the heart of this trick.
Okay?

596
00:38:41,230 --> 00:38:45,910
The center follows Newton's laws,
but the Gaussian can be,

597
00:38:45,940 --> 00:38:50,770
but the Hamiltonian can be reduced
if I choose a basis to a matrix.

598
00:38:51,280 --> 00:38:53,030
And so exponentiate the Gals,

599
00:38:53,110 --> 00:38:57,100
the Hamiltonian and moving
things is matrix multiplication.

600
00:38:58,300 --> 00:39:00,640
And I can do that on
every single data point.

601
00:39:01,240 --> 00:39:05,890
You give me a million cores and
I'll do it totally in parallel.

602
00:39:06,760 --> 00:39:11,320
And so a million guys,
we'll move delta t in one second.

603
00:39:12,130 --> 00:39:15,250
Okay, now I never have a million
is at my disposal, but if I had it,

604
00:39:15,520 --> 00:39:19,570
that would be a book you could
do. Okay. And so where are we?

605
00:39:20,860 --> 00:39:25,150
Because you're geeks. This is a
pseudo code for the algorithm. Okay.

606
00:39:25,780 --> 00:39:29,410
Step one, read reading data from a
spreadsheet. I want Rosenthal, okay.

607
00:39:30,160 --> 00:39:35,160
To do SVD and make the first frame
of the movie single DQC command.

608
00:39:36,400 --> 00:39:39,070
Make first,
first trajectory,

609
00:39:39,280 --> 00:39:44,170
boom from the data that you did SVD on.
Then you have to choose a basis.

610
00:39:44,800 --> 00:39:46,570
Now what am I mean by choosing a basis?

611
00:39:46,571 --> 00:39:50,140
So this is a long story and I'm not
going to give you all the gory details,

612
00:39:50,680 --> 00:39:55,060
but basically all of these Gaussians
I vectors and Hilbert's space, right?

613
00:39:55,720 --> 00:39:58,870
Everybody who, who's going to follow
me from the rest of this point?

614
00:39:58,871 --> 00:40:02,470
How many people know of vectors in Hilbert
space? Are All of you, none of you.

615
00:40:03,610 --> 00:40:08,050
This is going deep. Okay, I'm already
in trouble. Okay? Uh, they're vectors.

616
00:40:08,440 --> 00:40:12,160
They're independent, they're
not independent. In fact,
there's a look like this.

617
00:40:13,750 --> 00:40:15,460
So the question always is,

618
00:40:15,461 --> 00:40:19,930
how many vectors do I need to create
all the other vectors as linear

619
00:40:19,931 --> 00:40:22,720
combinations of those vectors?
The more important question is,

620
00:40:23,320 --> 00:40:28,320
if I only want to be accurate to 70% how
many vectors do I need in order to get

621
00:40:29,261 --> 00:40:34,261
70% coverage of the data that
I can reconstruct everybody
and get that right at

622
00:40:34,631 --> 00:40:37,720
that level. That's how
you pick a basis. Okay.

623
00:40:37,750 --> 00:40:40,210
I mean it's a story about how
you pick a basis, but that's it.

624
00:40:40,600 --> 00:40:43,810
Then you just have to evaluate
in this basis the kinetic term,

625
00:40:44,500 --> 00:40:46,430
the potential term.
And you,

626
00:40:46,460 --> 00:40:49,900
you try to keep the number of actors
in the basis by adjusting gamma.

627
00:40:50,170 --> 00:40:53,050
So you don't need more
than 1500 2000 vectors.

628
00:40:53,051 --> 00:40:57,310
Cause I don't want to be dealing with
big, major cs. And so by adjusting gamma,

629
00:40:57,311 --> 00:41:02,050
I can get very good coverage for a
fixed number of actors. And by the way,

630
00:41:02,051 --> 00:41:04,270
that's an algorithm for
picking gamma for the problem.

631
00:41:04,630 --> 00:41:08,680
So that takes my freedom of choice out.
Now I can only say who I want,

632
00:41:08,681 --> 00:41:13,300
60% coverage of 50% coverage
and nothing changes very much.

633
00:41:13,301 --> 00:41:15,790
So I don't need to pick gamma.

634
00:41:16,600 --> 00:41:20,860
And then I built a Hamiltonian,
I have to exponentiate that matrix,

635
00:41:21,100 --> 00:41:24,580
eat to a minus,
I times a timestamp times the Hamiltonian.

636
00:41:25,150 --> 00:41:26,980
And then I just go around
multiplying things.

637
00:41:26,981 --> 00:41:31,300
And every time I multiply I find where
the centers of the packets are and I

638
00:41:31,510 --> 00:41:36,050
started again and I keep doing that.
And so after that it's just a loop.

639
00:41:36,170 --> 00:41:39,770
At the end of that loop, I have a movie
and then I just show you the movie.

640
00:41:40,610 --> 00:41:44,750
So what's going on is serious
underneath complicated stuff.

641
00:41:45,170 --> 00:41:47,780
But the movie shows you
everything that's happening.

642
00:41:48,500 --> 00:41:50,390
We don't need to know what's happening,

643
00:41:50,420 --> 00:41:52,640
we only have to know what it's telling me.

644
00:41:53,030 --> 00:41:57,080
And it's telling me where
the higher density locally,
higher density regions are.

645
00:41:57,650 --> 00:42:02,420
And so now the fun is you just go off and
do whatever else you're interested in.

646
00:42:02,421 --> 00:42:04,100
Cause you've seen the
structure of the data.

647
00:42:04,370 --> 00:42:07,700
It's told you where the whales
are hidden in the data. Okay,

648
00:42:07,701 --> 00:42:09,440
you're going to go down and do that.

649
00:42:09,890 --> 00:42:14,720
And so Dq sees benefits are basically
defined by the three nos. No cleaning,

650
00:42:14,721 --> 00:42:16,850
no hypothesis,
no expert knowledge.

651
00:42:17,570 --> 00:42:22,040
I hope I've convinced you it lets you
find hidden unexpected insights and the

652
00:42:22,041 --> 00:42:22,910
big dense data.

653
00:42:23,360 --> 00:42:27,890
Even more so when there's multiple
things going on in the data,

654
00:42:29,030 --> 00:42:34,030
it pulls out the levels of information
just by following your nose.

655
00:42:34,880 --> 00:42:39,880
I mean nobody expected this data to have
stuff going on in tens of thousands of

656
00:42:40,251 --> 00:42:41,084
genes.

657
00:42:41,330 --> 00:42:44,770
But as you keep pulling more and more
genes that you keep seeing that other pot,

658
00:42:44,810 --> 00:42:49,810
the second pattern that means tens of
thousands of genes have been polluted by

659
00:42:50,571 --> 00:42:54,470
the cancer and just it's,
which tells you right away,

660
00:42:54,710 --> 00:42:59,330
it's really easy to convince yourself
that you can diagnose based on information

661
00:42:59,690 --> 00:43:03,230
that has nothing to do with the cost.
Okay?

662
00:43:03,260 --> 00:43:07,400
You have to know the data has this so
that you can go in and see which is more

663
00:43:07,401 --> 00:43:12,290
important because the information
is in tens of thousands of genes.

664
00:43:12,291 --> 00:43:16,880
It's not in a few genes. Okay? So this
is a way of looking at this kind of data.

665
00:43:17,480 --> 00:43:21,980
My colleague hasn't seen I who don't
know much about this kind of, I mean,

666
00:43:21,981 --> 00:43:23,720
the neat thing about this,
why do I love this?

667
00:43:23,750 --> 00:43:27,770
I get to be what I always wanted
to be the consummate Dillard time.

668
00:43:27,950 --> 00:43:32,750
I get to work on a problem not knowing
what it is. I loaded in the data,

669
00:43:32,751 --> 00:43:35,540
I see something my friend comes and says,
that's interesting.

670
00:43:36,020 --> 00:43:39,110
And then we start talking.
And so I only learned about the problem,

671
00:43:39,111 --> 00:43:41,600
what I discovered in the data.
Okay.

672
00:43:41,630 --> 00:43:44,810
And I get to work on in field
after field after field.

673
00:43:45,260 --> 00:43:50,150
And it's why the answer to the question,
why aren't other people using this?

674
00:43:50,510 --> 00:43:54,110
So I'm having such a good time, I'm not
doing a good job of telling the story.

675
00:43:55,190 --> 00:43:58,280
And Burton Richter actually,
who's one of my, uh,

676
00:43:58,340 --> 00:44:01,910
so he's a Nobel prize winning physicist.
He yells at me all the time, he says,

677
00:44:01,911 --> 00:44:03,110
you're having too good a time.

678
00:44:05,540 --> 00:44:09,020
He's on my board and he yells at me,
you are having to go to time.

679
00:44:09,021 --> 00:44:11,810
You're not out there getting
this into the public.

680
00:44:12,680 --> 00:44:16,970
So now I am engaged, uh, in at any rate,

681
00:44:17,900 --> 00:44:21,140
the insights are there and they're
stranger than you might have guessed,

682
00:44:21,410 --> 00:44:26,410
which leads me to quote hamlet that there
were more things and will therefore as

683
00:44:26,961 --> 00:44:29,930
a stranger give it welcomed.
There are more things in heaven and earth,

684
00:44:29,940 --> 00:44:34,350
Horatio then I dreamt of
in your philosophy. Okay.

685
00:44:34,410 --> 00:44:38,460
Datasets have more to say than
you ever guessed they could have.

686
00:44:39,300 --> 00:44:43,990
And there is a tool that can pull the
data apart in a way which lets you see

687
00:44:45,030 --> 00:44:48,510
this is information about the company.
That's my information.

688
00:44:48,511 --> 00:44:53,100
You can get to me and we can
have a conversation. Okay.

689
00:44:54,120 --> 00:44:54,953
I'm done.

690
00:45:02,640 --> 00:45:02,831
Hi.

691
00:45:02,831 --> 00:45:06,010
The first question that was submitted
beforehand is what are the most promising

692
00:45:06,011 --> 00:45:09,490
applications for your technique and how
should Googlers think about potentially

693
00:45:09,491 --> 00:45:13,580
using it? I think you answered a
little bit of the first one, but, um,

694
00:45:14,360 --> 00:45:17,180
I answer to that.
Yeah,

695
00:45:17,270 --> 00:45:20,240
it has to do with I'm a company now
and I've been told by people not to do

696
00:45:20,241 --> 00:45:24,320
certain things. So the truth is we're
not telling anybody this, right?

697
00:45:24,980 --> 00:45:28,260
So, uh, I don't care
what the data comes from.

698
00:45:29,750 --> 00:45:30,440
I did,

699
00:45:30,440 --> 00:45:35,420
I don't use any knowledge of the data
so you can imagine what it's good for.

700
00:45:35,600 --> 00:45:37,160
However,
I have to tell you,

701
00:45:37,220 --> 00:45:41,810
I'm really interested in pursuing one
vertical market because otherwise my

702
00:45:41,811 --> 00:45:43,880
advisers will tell me I'm
doing a terrible thing.

703
00:45:44,060 --> 00:45:46,310
So while I'm pursuing a single vertical,

704
00:45:46,340 --> 00:45:49,130
my first thing frankly is I'd love to,

705
00:45:49,160 --> 00:45:51,650
if there is a market there,

706
00:45:52,280 --> 00:45:54,230
look at a bio,

707
00:45:54,410 --> 00:45:59,410
medicine and Pharma because I think I
showed you that we have the potential to

708
00:46:00,651 --> 00:46:05,651
do precision medicine and then I
can solve my dream of saving lives.

709
00:46:06,110 --> 00:46:09,170
Okay. Which is what I'd
really like to do. Uh,

710
00:46:09,200 --> 00:46:12,500
I have other examples and I welcome
people who want to have a discussion.

711
00:46:12,501 --> 00:46:15,950
I can stay here till
five o'clock. Okay. Uh,

712
00:46:17,300 --> 00:46:20,360
there are examples of the
supply to market segmentation.

713
00:46:20,390 --> 00:46:24,770
Examples applied to dealing with very
noisy data like finding contraband,

714
00:46:24,771 --> 00:46:25,700
nuclear material,

715
00:46:25,701 --> 00:46:29,690
driving around the city of Chicago
with a lousy handheld detector.

716
00:46:30,370 --> 00:46:35,190
Um, there are examples with hyperspectral
camera information. There are,

717
00:46:36,350 --> 00:46:39,260
so you tell me what it's good for.
I leave it in your lap.

718
00:46:39,590 --> 00:46:43,850
A Googlers at the moment.
How can they think about how to apply it?

719
00:46:44,990 --> 00:46:47,390
Talk to me. I mean it, it'll
take some talking. Look,

720
00:46:47,391 --> 00:46:50,480
I'm telling you to do something that
already violates everything that

721
00:46:50,481 --> 00:46:55,130
everybody's ever told you about looking
at data, right? Uh, I'm telling you,

722
00:46:55,131 --> 00:46:57,890
don't clean your data. If you try to
clean your data, I'm gonna slap your hand.

723
00:46:58,940 --> 00:47:01,460
It's not what you learn and
use statistics course. Okay?

724
00:47:01,900 --> 00:47:04,580
The next thing I'm telling you is don't
make a hypothesis because you were an

725
00:47:04,581 --> 00:47:09,320
idiot. You don't know what you're asking.
Okay? You're biasing the result. I mean,

726
00:47:09,800 --> 00:47:11,660
I have people who hate me for saying this,

727
00:47:12,500 --> 00:47:16,880
but that's the best way to
take a first look at data.

728
00:47:17,450 --> 00:47:20,660
The other stuff comes in when you've
understood what's in your data,

729
00:47:21,050 --> 00:47:25,190
when it's shown you what it has to say
to you, what it's told you, which story.

730
00:47:25,430 --> 00:47:30,310
It has a story to tell, but you
have to let it have a voice. Okay.

731
00:47:30,311 --> 00:47:32,140
And this is the way to
let it have a voice.

732
00:47:32,141 --> 00:47:35,530
There may be other ways to let it have
a voice. I just don't know them. Okay.

733
00:47:35,531 --> 00:47:39,680
At anyway. I love this one. It's my baby.
Oh, quite freely admit to bias. Okay.

734
00:47:40,150 --> 00:47:43,300
But uh,
I guess that's the answer to the question.

735
00:47:43,360 --> 00:47:46,780
And anybody who wants to talk to me,
I'm more than happy to talk about it.

736
00:47:47,100 --> 00:47:49,940
In the example of you have
dealt with the cancer cells,

737
00:47:49,970 --> 00:47:52,580
it did you plot the also healthy cells?

738
00:47:53,050 --> 00:47:56,610
I wish I knew that. Right.
We only had six cells.

739
00:47:57,300 --> 00:48:01,710
However you saw I had a hypothesis.
It was the healthy cell data,

740
00:48:01,920 --> 00:48:05,220
but I could nevertheless less prove I
was wrong by only looking at the six cell

741
00:48:05,221 --> 00:48:06,054
information.

742
00:48:06,270 --> 00:48:09,510
Took me a little while to realize all
I had to do was evolve it and see what

743
00:48:09,511 --> 00:48:11,640
would happen.
And if they separated,

744
00:48:11,670 --> 00:48:16,670
it wasn't healthy cell inflammation
because glioblastoma and low grade gliomas

745
00:48:17,850 --> 00:48:21,270
are the same cell.
I couldn't tell from the other cells,

746
00:48:21,600 --> 00:48:25,380
but those two were an indicator.
If they separated,

747
00:48:26,190 --> 00:48:30,900
the information was different for those
two diseases and therefore it wasn't

748
00:48:30,901 --> 00:48:32,130
healthy cell information.

749
00:48:32,460 --> 00:48:36,690
It was pollution of the
genome by the cancer.

750
00:48:37,590 --> 00:48:39,390
I wish I had the information.

751
00:48:39,420 --> 00:48:44,420
I am now looking for people with datasets
that have medical information that,

752
00:48:45,090 --> 00:48:49,740
I mean, all I have is the histologists
said this is thyroid cancer.

753
00:48:49,950 --> 00:48:54,690
Great. So the histologists, it's
a 140 different cancers. Okay.

754
00:48:55,260 --> 00:48:56,700
Even the Glioblastoma,

755
00:48:56,701 --> 00:49:01,080
which is a pretty tight cluster is still
quite a while and extended structure.

756
00:49:01,110 --> 00:49:05,790
It's not one cancer. Okay. The
low grade Gliomas for sure or not.

757
00:49:05,791 --> 00:49:09,210
And there's a connection between
the mid early stages. Okay.

758
00:49:09,420 --> 00:49:11,850
So what is all of that damn define though?

759
00:49:11,880 --> 00:49:14,850
Is there more in this data that
I didn't tell you that? Yes,

760
00:49:15,150 --> 00:49:17,310
but I'm outside of my wheelhouse.
If I talk about it,

761
00:49:17,311 --> 00:49:21,120
it's deeply biological information.
I don't understand it.

762
00:49:21,960 --> 00:49:25,380
My colleague tells me he
doesn't understand that either,

763
00:49:26,070 --> 00:49:27,480
but the biologists so sure.

764
00:49:27,481 --> 00:49:32,130
To be interested in it because nobody's
ever seen that before. Okay. So,

765
00:49:32,190 --> 00:49:36,180
uh, it, it just, it's so much fun
to take a data set of park this way.

766
00:49:36,750 --> 00:49:41,730
I mean your notice I never calculated
a thing. I just made movies.

767
00:49:47,090 --> 00:49:47,923
Yes.

768
00:49:49,400 --> 00:49:53,500
As far as I understand you're
creating this wave function, uh,

769
00:49:54,180 --> 00:49:54,830
uh,

770
00:49:54,830 --> 00:49:59,440
treating those data points as
probability distribution of [inaudible].

771
00:50:00,460 --> 00:50:05,020
They're just functions that are peaked
at the data and then I'm adding them up

772
00:50:05,350 --> 00:50:10,030
and I'm hoping that the resulting function
has maxima where there's more data

773
00:50:10,720 --> 00:50:14,350
and local minima where there's less data.
So I'm plotting the density.

774
00:50:15,070 --> 00:50:19,330
If you start getting into probability
questions and you try to understand this

775
00:50:19,331 --> 00:50:22,670
in some profound way about
probability amplitudes, right?

776
00:50:23,440 --> 00:50:27,160
You're heading down a rabbit hole that
you shouldn't be going down. Okay.

777
00:50:27,380 --> 00:50:28,220
It's a trick.

778
00:50:29,860 --> 00:50:34,790
This is normous problem to me because
people love quantum mechanics. It's,

779
00:50:35,000 --> 00:50:39,920
it's, I love quantum mechanics.
It's fabulous. But I'm
abusing corner mechanics.

780
00:50:40,730 --> 00:50:45,730
I am taking what I know from
quantum mechanics and all
the years I spent knowing

781
00:50:46,041 --> 00:50:49,280
how to solve problems, not
perturber differently. Okay.

782
00:50:49,281 --> 00:50:53,390
And I'm stealing them to do a problem,
which is like,

783
00:50:53,540 --> 00:50:55,670
it's not 100% light gradient descent.

784
00:50:56,090 --> 00:50:57,920
You really want to be
mystified a little bit.

785
00:50:57,950 --> 00:51:01,520
Why can I work in a hundred or a thousand
dimensions when other people fail in

786
00:51:01,521 --> 00:51:04,600
10? Well, I happen to know why they fail.

787
00:51:05,390 --> 00:51:09,770
The reason they fail is if you would
have formed this probability this, uh,

788
00:51:09,920 --> 00:51:12,980
so you've got me doing it,
shame on you. At any rate,

789
00:51:14,760 --> 00:51:18,590
uh, if you were to take this, uh,

790
00:51:18,680 --> 00:51:22,430
potential function and look
at it under a microscope,

791
00:51:22,460 --> 00:51:26,210
you would see that little ripples
form because as the dimension goes up,

792
00:51:26,211 --> 00:51:30,800
statistical small statistical
fluctuations start to happen a lot.

793
00:51:31,160 --> 00:51:33,680
Okay?
That's what everybody gets stuck in.

794
00:51:33,770 --> 00:51:37,280
If they try doing kneeling
or something like that,

795
00:51:37,550 --> 00:51:38,990
they find too many clusters.

796
00:51:39,620 --> 00:51:43,220
I want to see only the big shape
then envelops that whole thing.

797
00:51:43,880 --> 00:51:45,890
So I didn't tell you about the
other parameter in the problem.

798
00:51:46,490 --> 00:51:49,910
The other parameter which was set to one
when I made the potential function is

799
00:51:49,911 --> 00:51:53,030
the mass of the particle.
There's moving quantum mechanics.

800
00:51:53,031 --> 00:51:54,590
That's a wonderful thing called tunneling.

801
00:51:55,310 --> 00:51:59,180
If I make that mass
lower than one like 0.1,

802
00:51:59,780 --> 00:52:03,590
it's not going to see the little minimum.
They vanish it tunnels through them.

803
00:52:05,690 --> 00:52:10,040
So in fact you only CVN developing
big potential and so I can work.

804
00:52:10,070 --> 00:52:12,410
I have worked in 1,024 dementia.

805
00:52:14,170 --> 00:52:18,720
Well it's two things are happening
as the mask will go offline. Okay.

806
00:52:19,010 --> 00:52:22,640
Not Fair to other people
for us to get a yes,

807
00:52:24,170 --> 00:52:25,400
but sometimes it just goes through.

808
00:52:26,970 --> 00:52:28,890
Um,
another question from the Dory.

809
00:52:29,490 --> 00:52:33,810
Early quantum computers won't have many
cubits are long coherence times how you

810
00:52:33,811 --> 00:52:36,910
get big data sets into the machine
before the cubits. Decohere

811
00:52:36,970 --> 00:52:41,530
I'm not doing quantum computing,
I'm doing classical computing.

812
00:52:41,531 --> 00:52:43,210
I don't need to answer that question.

813
00:52:46,210 --> 00:52:47,043
Next question.

814
00:52:49,380 --> 00:52:53,320
Uh, what have you found DQC is more
effective than other ML techniques?

815
00:52:53,710 --> 00:52:56,500
Have you found heuristics as to why
that is? I think you also answered

816
00:52:56,610 --> 00:52:59,730
a little bit. I tried to answer
that all through this thing. I mean,

817
00:53:00,060 --> 00:53:04,830
I can say it again.
So not only don't I care about the data,

818
00:53:04,831 --> 00:53:07,140
I don't care about the
size of the Dataset. Okay.

819
00:53:07,170 --> 00:53:11,790
If you run this on small data
sets, which it was done. Okay.

820
00:53:11,791 --> 00:53:14,820
There's something that people use for
the small datasets called as your card

821
00:53:14,821 --> 00:53:18,600
score. I think some of you are
familiar with that. I don't like it,

822
00:53:18,840 --> 00:53:23,830
but it's the main figure of mirror.
So applied to small datasets,

823
00:53:23,850 --> 00:53:28,850
Nicu seizure card scores run from 0.8
seventh the 0.96 when I spoke to somebody

824
00:53:29,851 --> 00:53:34,200
at Hanford labs, he was a spook and he
said, what kind of is your card scores?

825
00:53:34,201 --> 00:53:35,580
These you said? I said,
I don't do that. Great.

826
00:53:35,581 --> 00:53:40,581
I do 0.8 6.9 he said I kill for 0.86.

827
00:53:41,550 --> 00:53:43,980
Okay. Uh, so we do very well,

828
00:53:44,010 --> 00:53:49,010
but why am I interested in
small data sets and know why?

829
00:53:49,380 --> 00:53:50,340
Small datasets,

830
00:53:50,370 --> 00:53:55,050
anybody can get an answer on when
a Dataset has no separations in it.

831
00:53:55,051 --> 00:53:59,640
When you plot it earned him many
methods that can touch that problem.

832
00:53:59,940 --> 00:54:00,773
Okay.

833
00:54:00,990 --> 00:54:04,980
The HDD scans as it can touch it
and only works up to 10 dimensions.

834
00:54:04,981 --> 00:54:08,970
Number one and it degrades badly
and 10 dimensions, but number two,

835
00:54:08,971 --> 00:54:12,060
you also saw kids the wrong answer for
reasons having to do with the data set.

836
00:54:12,061 --> 00:54:14,610
It's complex and more than
one thing that's going on,

837
00:54:14,611 --> 00:54:18,000
it doesn't know what he's looking for.
DQC somehow avoids that.

838
00:54:18,360 --> 00:54:21,810
It's hidden in the density of the
data in the high dimensions. Okay.

839
00:54:21,870 --> 00:54:25,950
I mean it just past that
point, I already proved to you,

840
00:54:25,951 --> 00:54:29,490
I can visualize the data in 48 dimensions
that tell you how the answer is going

841
00:54:29,491 --> 00:54:31,590
to come out. Thought I
did, but I was wrong.

842
00:54:32,130 --> 00:54:36,060
Nice thing is I can't make the QC do what
I want. It'll do what it's going to do.

843
00:54:41,430 --> 00:54:45,180
I have a question.
So if I have a large,

844
00:54:45,230 --> 00:54:46,680
a high dimensional data set,

845
00:54:47,400 --> 00:54:52,400
is the other use cases where you would
not recommend to QC or I was killing

846
00:54:53,251 --> 00:54:57,000
these guys over lunch? I love
that question. So I'm a physicist.

847
00:54:57,510 --> 00:55:01,920
I believe everything has a
failure mode. Okay. Absolutely.

848
00:55:01,921 --> 00:55:03,270
Believe that with my gut,

849
00:55:03,900 --> 00:55:08,130
I spent five years trying to find
the Dataset it doesn't work on. Okay.

850
00:55:08,610 --> 00:55:12,960
I thought I had it. Okay. I thought
I had an Alzheimer's Dataset,

851
00:55:13,530 --> 00:55:18,530
which somebody gave me and it was 1500
Alzheimer's pay or 3000 I don't remember.

852
00:55:20,700 --> 00:55:23,790
And it was 250,000 snips.

853
00:55:24,780 --> 00:55:27,930
And they said,
so the information we want to know,

854
00:55:27,931 --> 00:55:32,640
can you see people who would have laid
out onset Alzheimer's and people who

855
00:55:32,641 --> 00:55:35,910
won't based on these snips?
And so I ran the data,

856
00:55:36,420 --> 00:55:38,870
so I dunno where they ran it in,
but when I looked,

857
00:55:38,890 --> 00:55:42,150
it was something like a hundred
150 dimensions was appropriate.

858
00:55:42,150 --> 00:55:46,980
I could get reconstruct the whole
Dataset to the 1% level by that.

859
00:55:47,170 --> 00:55:50,910
So there's no point in running
and 250,000 dimensions. Okay,

860
00:55:50,911 --> 00:55:54,960
I'll run in a hundred and something.
I saw lots of stuff.

861
00:55:55,350 --> 00:56:00,350
Unfortunately what I saw is what 23
[inaudible] or ancestry.com I saw what was

862
00:56:01,891 --> 00:56:05,760
probably, I didn't have the
information was most certainly, uh,

863
00:56:06,750 --> 00:56:10,230
data that had to do with ethnicity.
Okay.

864
00:56:11,070 --> 00:56:13,380
But when I looked at all
of the clusters that I had,

865
00:56:13,381 --> 00:56:15,270
and I calculated the
number of people who had,

866
00:56:15,271 --> 00:56:19,410
had been autopsied and shown to have
Alzheimer's and the number that were

867
00:56:19,411 --> 00:56:23,560
autopsied insurance, so they
own, unfortunately, they
were all dead and I hope,

868
00:56:23,770 --> 00:56:24,790
and uh,

869
00:56:25,990 --> 00:56:29,020
they were shown to have Alzheimer's
and not have Alzheimer's.

870
00:56:29,680 --> 00:56:33,970
The distribution in the general population
and the distribution in the clusters

871
00:56:33,971 --> 00:56:38,710
up to 1% variations, it's
the same. So finally,

872
00:56:38,711 --> 00:56:42,790
after knocking myself out,
trying to vary the parameters I have,

873
00:56:43,510 --> 00:56:46,750
and of course I couldn't get a different
answer. I called the guys up and said,

874
00:56:46,780 --> 00:56:50,470
I'm sorry you say this stuff there,
I don't see a thing.

875
00:56:51,070 --> 00:56:53,410
There's just nothing else.
I'm is related in your data.

876
00:56:54,010 --> 00:56:57,760
I think eva talked to the proteomics
group at Stanford Hospital and they asked

877
00:56:57,761 --> 00:57:00,220
me this wonderful question, what's
your failure mode? And I said,

878
00:57:00,250 --> 00:57:03,580
I failed a Bismal Leon [inaudible] data.
And,

879
00:57:03,610 --> 00:57:07,690
and I was proud I had a
failure mode. And he said, uh,

880
00:57:08,620 --> 00:57:12,190
I know the Dataset you just talked about.
We worked on it for 10 years.

881
00:57:12,940 --> 00:57:15,070
There's nothing in that data center.

882
00:57:17,590 --> 00:57:18,220
So,
you know,

883
00:57:18,220 --> 00:57:22,600
my week spent looking at the Dataset
four times was not in the end wasted,

884
00:57:22,601 --> 00:57:27,550
but I still don't know my thallium
I'm sorry. I wish I knew it. No,

885
00:57:27,580 --> 00:57:30,700
I it has to be there. You can't work on
everything. Nothing works on everything.

886
00:57:31,210 --> 00:57:34,990
I just haven't gotten unlucky or lucky.
I don't know which it would be,

887
00:57:35,590 --> 00:57:38,170
but it would be nice to know
what the limitations are.

888
00:57:38,470 --> 00:57:40,840
Density variations is such a robust thing.

889
00:57:41,620 --> 00:57:45,670
It's such a different way
of looking at the data that

890
00:57:47,350 --> 00:57:48,670
it's hard to see when it fails.

891
00:57:50,170 --> 00:57:51,003
Thank you so much.

892
00:57:53,800 --> 00:57:56,360
Um, we were talking maybe for one
more question. There's any live,

893
00:57:56,430 --> 00:57:58,820
we can also get one from the dory.

894
00:58:01,240 --> 00:58:02,073
MMM.

895
00:58:03,760 --> 00:58:05,720
Oh, this was sort of just ask,
but what are the downsides?

896
00:58:06,170 --> 00:58:09,920
DQC Why isn't everyone using it right now?

897
00:58:10,370 --> 00:58:12,350
I guess this is part of,
it's my fault.

898
00:58:13,870 --> 00:58:16,330
My wife was sitting here, so I don't
want to say it again. She'll yell at me.

899
00:58:16,331 --> 00:58:20,170
It's my fault. In some sense
it's my fault. Okay. Uh,

900
00:58:20,800 --> 00:58:24,430
I don't think I've been the best spokesman
for recruiting young people to jump

901
00:58:24,431 --> 00:58:28,270
on the bandwagon and start doing it
cause I've been having too good at time

902
00:58:28,271 --> 00:58:29,980
using it and,

903
00:58:30,010 --> 00:58:34,210
and I guess that's been my problem
through life. Okay. I mean,

904
00:58:34,211 --> 00:58:38,350
I always got yelled at by the head of
the lab that you got to write another

905
00:58:38,351 --> 00:58:39,790
paper you're not sharing.

906
00:58:40,780 --> 00:58:44,800
He says you are having too good a time
knowing what we don't know and you're not

907
00:58:44,801 --> 00:58:47,890
sharing. And uh, probably I
don't share enough. Right.

908
00:58:48,430 --> 00:58:52,840
So you invited me and I'm sharing.
Thank you.

909
00:58:56,380 --> 00:58:57,180
Wow.
Well

910
00:58:57,180 --> 00:58:58,350
thank you for sitting through it.
