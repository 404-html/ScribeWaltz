1
00:00:04,310 --> 00:00:05,143
Okay.

2
00:00:05,750 --> 00:00:08,330
So Andy is our guest here today.

3
00:00:08,600 --> 00:00:10,790
She has been for quite some time,

4
00:00:10,791 --> 00:00:14,930
the director of access technology at
the National Federation of the blind.

5
00:00:14,931 --> 00:00:19,490
And in this role she has worked with
top companies like Microsoft, uh,

6
00:00:19,550 --> 00:00:23,750
blackboard, Ebay, apple,
Google of course, um,

7
00:00:23,810 --> 00:00:28,790
to shape the way that they develop and
test their products for accessibility.

8
00:00:29,150 --> 00:00:34,150
She's now at Microsoft in the
role of pm for accessibility on,

9
00:00:35,420 --> 00:00:37,250
I knew I was going to
not be able to say this,

10
00:00:37,730 --> 00:00:42,200
the corporate and external
legal affairs team. Um,

11
00:00:43,010 --> 00:00:46,760
and she's been in that role
since 2015 she's also author,

12
00:00:47,510 --> 00:00:48,800
coauthor of a book

13
00:00:50,750 --> 00:00:55,750
called insuring digital
content accessibility through
policies and procedures.

14
00:00:56,990 --> 00:01:00,740
And she's got a wealth of
experience and knowledge.

15
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:05,060
So I'll just bring her up to
start, start talking. Welcome Anne.

16
00:01:09,530 --> 00:01:13,270
Hello. Are you buddy? Yep. Every time.

17
00:01:13,430 --> 00:01:17,990
You guys are way amazing.
Hopefully I won't put you to sleep.

18
00:01:18,690 --> 00:01:23,600
Well, you guys have coffee
ready? Doesn't face all right.

19
00:01:23,690 --> 00:01:26,480
How could you not have coffee ready
when you are in Washington, right? Yeah,

20
00:01:26,870 --> 00:01:31,040
exactly.
So every time I come to Google campus,

21
00:01:31,041 --> 00:01:35,260
whether it is in Kirkland
and mountain view, um,

22
00:01:35,900 --> 00:01:38,980
New York,
I always feel extremely welcoming.

23
00:01:39,020 --> 00:01:44,020
I am humbled and grateful
by the hospitality that
you have extended to me for

24
00:01:46,221 --> 00:01:50,930
this many, many years. My, his
history of partnering with Google,

25
00:01:50,931 --> 00:01:52,580
advocating for accessibility,

26
00:01:53,060 --> 00:01:57,420
being a royal pain sometimes for
you and other companies will uh,

27
00:01:58,040 --> 00:02:01,280
uh, happening, you know,
go going back 10 years ago,

28
00:02:01,340 --> 00:02:05,270
probably 10 years ago.
Wow. Many of you is still,

29
00:02:05,271 --> 00:02:08,660
for many of you in this room
are probably not in college yet.

30
00:02:10,010 --> 00:02:13,070
That amazing. Anyway, um,

31
00:02:13,790 --> 00:02:18,790
in the past 10 years you have listen
to the voice of customers and I really

32
00:02:21,741 --> 00:02:23,620
admire that about Google.

33
00:02:24,890 --> 00:02:29,890
I have an opportunity to
witness tremendous amount
of improvement coming from

34
00:02:30,621 --> 00:02:33,620
you
and your hard work.

35
00:02:34,370 --> 00:02:37,550
And I think it's only right
to take time to celebrate.

36
00:02:38,900 --> 00:02:43,900
And I want to go to through some of the
accessibility improvement that I've seen

37
00:02:46,010 --> 00:02:49,370
happening from Google in the
past 10 years, which by the way,

38
00:02:49,371 --> 00:02:52,490
even though I am working for Microsoft,
I rejoice in that.

39
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:54,980
I like accessibility improvement because

40
00:02:57,250 --> 00:03:00,190
at the very heart of who I am,
I'm an accessibility

41
00:03:00,190 --> 00:03:02,230
advocate and I live it every day.

42
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:08,040
And so when my peers are
successful in this arena,

43
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:13,800
I think we have the opportunity or the
obligation to celebrate your success and

44
00:03:16,030 --> 00:03:21,030
every other company success
that especially those who
are willing and commit to

45
00:03:22,061 --> 00:03:24,490
accessibility and willing
to do the hard work,

46
00:03:24,820 --> 00:03:28,150
willing to do what it takes to
make accessibility possible.

47
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:33,460
And you may think that
partnering across the industry,

48
00:03:33,940 --> 00:03:38,200
it's a rare thing, but really honestly
it must happen in accessibility.

49
00:03:39,190 --> 00:03:39,401
Uh,

50
00:03:39,401 --> 00:03:44,401
you and I know very well that we're
competing in power priorities every day.

51
00:03:46,030 --> 00:03:50,410
I accessibility, accessibility,
priorities, let me try again.

52
00:03:50,530 --> 00:03:52,440
Accessibility priorities,
uh,

53
00:03:52,710 --> 00:03:56,830
often compete with other
priorities in product development.

54
00:03:57,970 --> 00:04:00,120
And if the,

55
00:04:00,170 --> 00:04:05,170
and I think the only way for us to gain
a foot hole in accessibility is for

56
00:04:06,340 --> 00:04:11,340
industry to partner together to move
the accessibility agenda forward.

57
00:04:12,460 --> 00:04:16,180
Let's face it, if Google does
it, wouldn't Microsoft do it?

58
00:04:16,300 --> 00:04:19,390
Wouldn't apple do it with Facebook?
Do it in turn.

59
00:04:19,391 --> 00:04:24,160
If we work in partnership with
each other across the industry,

60
00:04:25,960 --> 00:04:30,960
then ultimately we'll make
our daily work much easier.

61
00:04:32,590 --> 00:04:36,520
The um, accessibility improvements
that I've seen from Google.

62
00:04:37,480 --> 00:04:41,290
It was a dream as of 10 years ago now,

63
00:04:42,910 --> 00:04:46,120
but some of these improvements
already visible in your products,

64
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:50,200
so let's take time to
celebrate some of them,

65
00:04:53,560 --> 00:04:57,730
you know, have Braille in the
various platforms of your product.

66
00:04:59,550 --> 00:05:01,710
You know,
when we

67
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:06,300
came to Google,
we were,

68
00:05:06,301 --> 00:05:10,100
we as in the use the users community,
especially blind user.

69
00:05:10,120 --> 00:05:14,940
We're asking Google Google about Braille
and we didn't,

70
00:05:14,941 --> 00:05:19,410
we weren't sure what the, we got to get
it, but the fact that we have it today,

71
00:05:19,710 --> 00:05:24,330
it's something that we need
to celebrate. Uh, the Android,

72
00:05:24,750 --> 00:05:29,580
oh, sorry, the Chromebook accessibility
steadily improving Google apps.

73
00:05:30,540 --> 00:05:35,540
Accessibility continues to improve over
the years and then with the release of

74
00:05:37,530 --> 00:05:39,690
android marshmallow and android.
Okay.

75
00:05:40,650 --> 00:05:45,360
I must say the accessibility improvement
and you have done is I needed to be

76
00:05:45,361 --> 00:05:46,194
commended.

77
00:05:46,650 --> 00:05:51,650
I know individuals who had
die hard apple fan is now,

78
00:05:52,710 --> 00:05:57,590
are now taking a look at Android,
no kid as viable options.

79
00:05:57,591 --> 00:06:02,510
This is something that we
need to celebrate. You have
a tremendous leadership,

80
00:06:03,070 --> 00:06:06,920
uh, team that provide
you with proper guidance.

81
00:06:07,130 --> 00:06:11,510
And I've come to know many of them.
Um,

82
00:06:11,570 --> 00:06:13,640
Eve Anderson,
of course,

83
00:06:13,820 --> 00:06:18,020
I consider her to be a good
friend and great colleague. Uh,

84
00:06:18,140 --> 00:06:22,590
I'm going to pick on you
Lewis, Anna, Laura, uh,

85
00:06:23,180 --> 00:06:26,030
Premera from, um, the chrome team,

86
00:06:26,750 --> 00:06:29,570
Sean laureate and Richard John will,

87
00:06:29,571 --> 00:06:32,900
I'm going to leave somebody out
and they're going to be offended.

88
00:06:32,901 --> 00:06:36,840
So I better stop well on the head. So, uh,

89
00:06:37,190 --> 00:06:41,330
but your success here,
we need to celebrate,

90
00:06:41,690 --> 00:06:46,640
but I'm sorry to say that it does
not need to be only your success,

91
00:06:46,641 --> 00:06:51,641
but we need to work together again to
move the agenda forward for the whole

92
00:06:52,191 --> 00:06:54,710
industry.
Because of this reason,

93
00:06:54,920 --> 00:06:59,920
we are creating our products to be
accessible and usable by our customers.

94
00:07:01,340 --> 00:07:06,200
Our customers are the most important,
um, individuals that were served.

95
00:07:07,910 --> 00:07:12,620
We are better start listening to them.
In the recent years,

96
00:07:12,890 --> 00:07:17,890
every company in the industry see the
straw procurement language inserted into

97
00:07:19,251 --> 00:07:23,300
accessibility, uh, into
a procurement policy.

98
00:07:24,430 --> 00:07:25,460
Our enterprise.

99
00:07:25,461 --> 00:07:30,380
Customers want to know that
when they purchase our products,

100
00:07:30,410 --> 00:07:34,490
they want to be reassured that when they
purchase our product and the deploy our

101
00:07:34,491 --> 00:07:38,720
products and services and that everyone
will be able to use our products and

102
00:07:38,721 --> 00:07:39,554
services.

103
00:07:39,770 --> 00:07:44,770
Now our customers are coming from a very
diverse demographic background as you

104
00:07:45,261 --> 00:07:45,561
know,

105
00:07:45,561 --> 00:07:50,561
and we have the responsibility as
technology company to find ways to empower

106
00:07:50,840 --> 00:07:55,840
every individual and give
them opportunities to be
the best that they can be.

107
00:07:58,490 --> 00:08:03,490
I also would like to point out to you
that the need of our external customers

108
00:08:03,801 --> 00:08:08,801
are not very different from the knee of
the internal colleagues with disability.

109
00:08:12,370 --> 00:08:17,370
It is extremely important and I think
imperative for people or for the

110
00:08:18,861 --> 00:08:23,861
technology companies to examine our
employment environment to ensure that we

111
00:08:25,161 --> 00:08:28,190
have an inclusive workforce.
Microsoft taking that seriously.

112
00:08:28,191 --> 00:08:32,150
I know Google has taken us seriously and
I hope more and more people are doing

113
00:08:32,151 --> 00:08:35,240
this,
so now how can we

114
00:08:37,170 --> 00:08:41,100
ensure that everything that
we create is accessible?

115
00:08:41,790 --> 00:08:46,790
I would like to propose that we employed
three basic principles that I learned

116
00:08:47,550 --> 00:08:51,660
to work very well in the past so
many years that have been an ad, uh,

117
00:08:51,720 --> 00:08:54,300
advocacy for accessibility.
And by the way,

118
00:08:54,301 --> 00:08:57,990
the experience that sharing with you
today I hope will prove useful at the

119
00:08:57,991 --> 00:09:00,390
minimum,
at least it's thought provoking,

120
00:09:00,690 --> 00:09:05,610
is the experience that I gleaned from
seeing things happening on both sides of

121
00:09:05,611 --> 00:09:10,590
the camp. Uh, I think, uh, my
experience is quite unique in that,

122
00:09:11,010 --> 00:09:11,251
you know,

123
00:09:11,251 --> 00:09:15,450
I used to represent a solely the end
users community and now I'm working with

124
00:09:15,510 --> 00:09:18,690
major industry player. So, um,

125
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:21,720
so I hope that my experience
can be useful to you.

126
00:09:22,530 --> 00:09:26,370
But the three principle that I would
like to bring to this talk are the

127
00:09:26,371 --> 00:09:30,270
following empathy,
engineering excellence and policy.

128
00:09:30,780 --> 00:09:35,780
We must learn from our diverse pool of
our cost of our customers and colleagues

129
00:09:37,231 --> 00:09:40,650
with disability when we
truly understand their needs.

130
00:09:42,150 --> 00:09:47,070
That is, I believe, when we can make
the right choice on how we can innovate.

131
00:09:47,730 --> 00:09:52,230
As an example,
if you have a complicated menu structures,

132
00:09:52,650 --> 00:09:56,640
why not just put a
edit box,

133
00:09:56,670 --> 00:10:01,670
edit feel where people can enter in the
command to search the commands name to

134
00:10:03,001 --> 00:10:07,170
search for various features
in the program. So not
everybody has to go through,

135
00:10:07,650 --> 00:10:12,600
uh, the, the, uh, complicated
menu structures. And this
is good for everybody,

136
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:17,250
not just the blind, but
um, everyone who you don't,

137
00:10:17,251 --> 00:10:21,270
I don't quite remember where the
location of certain feature said maybe.

138
00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:23,280
Okay.

139
00:10:23,280 --> 00:10:27,160
So things like that seems
simple, right? But, uh,

140
00:10:27,270 --> 00:10:29,820
we don't take the time to
think about it often enough.

141
00:10:30,270 --> 00:10:35,270
So does accessibility design
truly make product better?

142
00:10:37,230 --> 00:10:41,250
I believe yes. And I think you do too
because if you don't believe that it is,

143
00:10:41,251 --> 00:10:45,240
so you probably wouldn't be here
on Monday morning at 10 o'clock.

144
00:10:45,940 --> 00:10:50,640
I, you probably watched the debate. Don't
worry, I won't get into it last night.

145
00:10:50,641 --> 00:10:52,680
Staying up late and now you're here.

146
00:10:52,681 --> 00:10:56,910
So you must have some certain level
of commitment to accessibility,

147
00:10:56,911 --> 00:10:59,730
which I'm very glad to know now

148
00:11:01,370 --> 00:11:05,630
that let just not take my
word on this, right. Uh,

149
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:09,050
less examine historical record.

150
00:11:09,380 --> 00:11:14,380
I believe that I have over old 250
years of data to convince you that

151
00:11:16,580 --> 00:11:20,150
accessibility actually make our product
better. And I'm going to go through them.

152
00:11:20,151 --> 00:11:24,710
No, just kidding. Not every, not
everything, not everything. So,

153
00:11:25,190 --> 00:11:28,670
but let's just look at a three example.
If you want to know more. By the way,

154
00:11:28,671 --> 00:11:29,504
I have,

155
00:11:29,870 --> 00:11:34,870
I had handed my book over to Emma to be
included in Google library just for you

156
00:11:35,841 --> 00:11:39,830
to use as reference
material. But let me, uh, oh,

157
00:11:40,520 --> 00:11:45,260
that's good to know. Uh, let, let
me mention two or three things.

158
00:11:45,590 --> 00:11:46,460
Cordy keyboard.

159
00:11:47,390 --> 00:11:52,390
So the qwerty keyboard
was created by a man Oh,

160
00:11:53,230 --> 00:11:57,370
in the, the 18 set, the late 17 hundreds,

161
00:11:57,850 --> 00:12:02,240
uh, some type, some form of
this qwerty keyboard, uh,

162
00:12:02,410 --> 00:12:07,410
to allow his blind wife to write
him letters when he went on many,

163
00:12:07,691 --> 00:12:10,120
many long distance business trips.

164
00:12:10,690 --> 00:12:13,840
I'm so thankful that our mode of
transportation, it has advanced.

165
00:12:13,841 --> 00:12:15,020
We don't have to do a,

166
00:12:15,160 --> 00:12:19,090
we don't have to use the
same motor transportation in
the 17th centuries anymore.

167
00:12:19,330 --> 00:12:23,100
But nevertheless,
this keyboard in some form,

168
00:12:23,410 --> 00:12:27,940
some form of this keyboard
has been with us since then.

169
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:32,350
I love the fact that accessibility
actually created out of love.

170
00:12:32,740 --> 00:12:36,520
That's pretty cool. And standalone
reading machine for the blind.

171
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:42,000
So in the 1970s not the Ray Kurzweil who
now you have as part of your colleague,

172
00:12:45,340 --> 00:12:47,870
I'm pretty jealous about that.
Um,

173
00:12:48,470 --> 00:12:53,440
he is a beloved figure and among
the blind community in the 1970s,

174
00:12:53,770 --> 00:12:54,603
he,
um,

175
00:12:55,720 --> 00:13:00,400
created and invented a stand alone
reading machine for the blind.

176
00:13:00,401 --> 00:13:05,230
And back then all the machine,
it's about the size of a washing machine,

177
00:13:05,231 --> 00:13:06,430
I think.
Um,

178
00:13:07,720 --> 00:13:10,930
and as obviously have a very
slow computing capacity.

179
00:13:10,931 --> 00:13:15,931
But the groundbreaking thing about
this machine is it incorporated a three

180
00:13:19,001 --> 00:13:22,060
important technologies,
speech synthesizer,

181
00:13:23,350 --> 00:13:27,190
omnifont character recognition technology,
and a flatbed scanner.

182
00:13:28,360 --> 00:13:32,290
Now, if you asked it, the Kurzweil,

183
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:36,490
and if you don't get a chance to meet
him or at many of you have a chance to

184
00:13:36,491 --> 00:13:38,800
meet him, I would recommend it.
He's a very stimulating individual.

185
00:13:39,130 --> 00:13:44,130
He would tell you flat out that this
machine was created because he met a

186
00:13:45,460 --> 00:13:48,820
adopted daughter genic and the president
of the National Federation of the blind,

187
00:13:49,150 --> 00:13:51,670
um, in, in the 1970 and up.

188
00:13:51,671 --> 00:13:54,400
And he asked atherogenic and what kind
of problem and you want to solve for

189
00:13:54,401 --> 00:13:56,770
blind people and other
children. I said, well,

190
00:13:56,980 --> 00:14:01,980
we want to be able to give blind people
the ability to read print immediately,

191
00:14:02,621 --> 00:14:05,410
seamlessly,
easily just as sighted people.

192
00:14:06,490 --> 00:14:09,610
Well then they,
you know,

193
00:14:09,670 --> 00:14:13,150
the doctor Kurzweil and then
invented the reading machine.

194
00:14:13,151 --> 00:14:18,151
So look at today how individually
we use these technologies.

195
00:14:19,741 --> 00:14:21,100
Speech,
synthesizer,

196
00:14:21,470 --> 00:14:24,400
a omnifont character recognition
could go use it all the time.

197
00:14:24,401 --> 00:14:28,930
I use it all the time. And flatbed
scanner, you scan pictures, I dunno,

198
00:14:28,960 --> 00:14:32,410
probably weekly or daily and other,

199
00:14:33,720 --> 00:14:35,960
uh, technology, uh,

200
00:14:36,190 --> 00:14:40,200
invention that start first,
uh,

201
00:14:42,580 --> 00:14:44,500
for the blind. And, uh,

202
00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:48,280
it was the record player and
was invented by Thomas Edison.

203
00:14:48,281 --> 00:14:50,950
And if you look at his
pattern is in my book does a,

204
00:14:51,380 --> 00:14:56,110
there he invented the record player
because he wants to be able to give, uh,

205
00:14:56,220 --> 00:14:58,190
the blind ability to read.
Now,

206
00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:01,420
in the last century or more,

207
00:15:01,421 --> 00:15:06,421
we have experienced the explosion
of a multi billion dollar industry.

208
00:15:07,870 --> 00:15:11,190
Uh, I don't know how many of you
liked music, but I love music. Um,

209
00:15:11,740 --> 00:15:15,460
and so record player just created,
you know,

210
00:15:15,850 --> 00:15:19,720
to give the blind the ability
to read, uh, have really,

211
00:15:20,630 --> 00:15:24,490
uh, morphed into supporting, uh, uh,

212
00:15:24,730 --> 00:15:27,490
like I mentioned that the
multimillion dollar music industry,

213
00:15:27,491 --> 00:15:30,280
which is I think is remarkable,
uh,

214
00:15:30,520 --> 00:15:35,520
from this and sample it ability to
design does not only make our products

215
00:15:36,011 --> 00:15:36,371
better,

216
00:15:36,371 --> 00:15:41,371
but I believe accessibility is
a true source of innovation.

217
00:15:42,940 --> 00:15:47,560
Again, just look at how these
types of technology change how we,

218
00:15:47,620 --> 00:15:51,040
the public consume information today.
What about current example?

219
00:15:51,280 --> 00:15:54,940
Do we have any all right.
I believe so. You know,

220
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:59,110
recently Facebook, um, really, uh,

221
00:15:59,140 --> 00:16:04,140
invest in image recognition technology
now to describe a images on the web.

222
00:16:06,310 --> 00:16:11,020
Google, Microsoft, apple provide
accessibility out of the box. Um,

223
00:16:11,650 --> 00:16:13,450
and uh,
you know,

224
00:16:13,451 --> 00:16:18,451
you can look at Amazon and their effort
in making [inaudible] more accessible.

225
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:23,680
This is [inaudible] good beginning
however we must do even more.

226
00:16:24,100 --> 00:16:26,860
And you asked why do we want to do more?

227
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:35,240
The reason is we want to do more because
unemployment rate among people with

228
00:16:35,731 --> 00:16:39,900
disability is still very, very high. And

229
00:16:41,720 --> 00:16:46,720
the technology that we create can help
level the playing field for people with

230
00:16:47,871 --> 00:16:48,704
disability.

231
00:16:49,220 --> 00:16:53,240
If you look at the unemployment statistic
for people with disability in the

232
00:16:53,241 --> 00:16:54,550
United States,
um,

233
00:16:54,650 --> 00:16:58,280
just the blind demographic
have 70% unemployment rate.

234
00:16:58,850 --> 00:17:01,790
The work that you do today matters a lot.

235
00:17:02,610 --> 00:17:04,700
Now we friendly guys.

236
00:17:04,730 --> 00:17:09,560
If we have a country that has that
kind of unemployment statistic,

237
00:17:09,860 --> 00:17:11,300
the country would not survive.

238
00:17:11,301 --> 00:17:15,680
But yet we have people with disabilities
all over the world combating a

239
00:17:15,681 --> 00:17:19,870
unemployment rate this
high. And again, we have uh,

240
00:17:20,150 --> 00:17:24,500
an opportunity to make a difference here
in the past 16 years that I have been

241
00:17:24,560 --> 00:17:27,020
an at and accessibility advocate,

242
00:17:27,350 --> 00:17:30,740
I learn similarly to other areas.

243
00:17:30,741 --> 00:17:32,480
I'm queue up too soon.

244
00:17:32,570 --> 00:17:36,650
I learned that similar similarly
to other areas of computing,

245
00:17:36,830 --> 00:17:41,450
security and privacy as an example,
it's engineering excellence,

246
00:17:42,470 --> 00:17:46,790
also applicable to accessibility
and accessibility design.

247
00:17:48,260 --> 00:17:50,490
Without engineering excellence,

248
00:17:51,390 --> 00:17:56,390
it's not only difficult to integrate
accessibility design techniques into the

249
00:17:57,781 --> 00:17:59,280
development framework,

250
00:18:00,390 --> 00:18:05,390
but maintaining accessibility will also
be very difficult if not impossible.

251
00:18:07,770 --> 00:18:12,770
The under the industry can do more
to support our pms and engineers.

252
00:18:16,070 --> 00:18:20,000
Now, how many of you are
pms? Just say I nobody.

253
00:18:20,450 --> 00:18:25,160
Just one eye. How many of
you are engineers? Wow,

254
00:18:25,370 --> 00:18:27,020
that's great.
I appreciate you taking the time.

255
00:18:27,021 --> 00:18:30,090
I hope not too boring for you just yet.
Um,

256
00:18:31,280 --> 00:18:36,280
I would like to recommend the following
items for your consideration as you are

257
00:18:37,131 --> 00:18:42,131
working in Google and as a exists as the
industry press forward on accessibility

258
00:18:42,531 --> 00:18:45,860
agenda. I really do think,
see whether you agree with me.

259
00:18:46,550 --> 00:18:51,550
I really do think that you may not want
to admit it because you're on camera.

260
00:18:51,921 --> 00:18:53,890
You know too.

261
00:18:54,410 --> 00:18:57,860
I really do think that the industry should
provide engineer with better tooling.

262
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:05,410
No. Yes, there you go. Um,

263
00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:09,570
and and we should talk
more about that and uh,

264
00:19:09,610 --> 00:19:14,530
industry should do more to increase
the talent pipeline in accessibility

265
00:19:14,531 --> 00:19:19,120
computing area by partnering with
Educational Institution to ensure

266
00:19:19,121 --> 00:19:23,740
accessibility curriculum. I taught at
all level. Let me ask you something guys.

267
00:19:24,100 --> 00:19:28,300
Those of you who just graduate from
college or been in college for the past 10

268
00:19:28,301 --> 00:19:32,350
years, how many of you are
taught accessibility design? Wow.

269
00:19:32,351 --> 00:19:34,120
You win in colleges university.

270
00:19:35,410 --> 00:19:36,150
Yeah.

271
00:19:36,150 --> 00:19:40,530
Nobody. I am going to take
silence as no buddy. Um,

272
00:19:40,560 --> 00:19:44,430
so if, if somebody has been
taught, then please, uh,

273
00:19:45,060 --> 00:19:49,860
please let me know and I'm, I'm
happy for you if you have. So, uh,

274
00:19:49,861 --> 00:19:54,810
and the third thing that industry need
to do is to celebrate the achievement of

275
00:19:54,811 --> 00:19:59,811
engineers who invest in accessibility and
make a difference in making accessible

276
00:20:00,361 --> 00:20:04,440
products.
And finally,

277
00:20:04,500 --> 00:20:09,500
companies can do more to create a
well structured mentoring program to

278
00:20:11,940 --> 00:20:16,940
disseminate knowledge on
accessibility design among engineers.

279
00:20:18,510 --> 00:20:21,660
And we're going to take a look
at this one by one shortly.

280
00:20:22,770 --> 00:20:26,070
But I think that if we take
proper steps as an industry,

281
00:20:26,520 --> 00:20:31,450
we can swiftly and more holistically,
uh,

282
00:20:31,470 --> 00:20:35,700
moving sustainability agenda forward.
And isn't that our goal?

283
00:20:36,690 --> 00:20:36,901
Now,

284
00:20:36,901 --> 00:20:41,901
one of the biggest gap that I would like
to see the industry solve is tooling

285
00:20:43,950 --> 00:20:48,950
engineers and developers need toolings
that will enable them to design

286
00:20:49,150 --> 00:20:53,020
accessible websites and applications
and other products easily,

287
00:20:53,021 --> 00:20:58,021
seamlessly going back as far as the
wireframe product development stage.

288
00:21:00,010 --> 00:21:04,870
Don't you agree? Are
you naughty? Won't work.

289
00:21:05,080 --> 00:21:07,290
Sorry guys.
Um,

290
00:21:07,780 --> 00:21:11,680
today when we talk about accessibility,
automated tools,

291
00:21:12,490 --> 00:21:17,170
we often think about the various
accessibility testing tool,

292
00:21:17,470 --> 00:21:19,360
both pay and free.

293
00:21:19,870 --> 00:21:22,720
Even though these tools are useful,

294
00:21:23,590 --> 00:21:28,590
but they can only perform an audit after
website or applications are created,

295
00:21:33,610 --> 00:21:38,610
accessibility design must truly
be built in and not add on it.

296
00:21:41,050 --> 00:21:46,050
We started to think about accessibility
after apps and websites are created is

297
00:21:47,020 --> 00:21:49,810
absolutely too late.

298
00:21:51,070 --> 00:21:55,570
So what does this ideal tool look like?
Well,

299
00:21:57,430 --> 00:21:58,390
in my opinion,

300
00:21:59,140 --> 00:22:04,140
this idea to should have at minimum
this feature sets we should find in it a

301
00:22:05,781 --> 00:22:10,781
repository of all accessible standard
controls relevant to the platform for the

302
00:22:13,121 --> 00:22:14,320
engineers to use.

303
00:22:14,920 --> 00:22:19,720
This will help eliminate the
need for customized controls.

304
00:22:19,990 --> 00:22:21,580
I'll tell you one of the things that I,

305
00:22:22,180 --> 00:22:26,770
every time I talk to developers,
I often tell them,

306
00:22:26,771 --> 00:22:31,360
do not use customize controls
because if you use customize control,

307
00:22:31,361 --> 00:22:32,350
you're going to have to

308
00:22:34,210 --> 00:22:37,450
do tremendous amount of work to
make those controls are accessible.

309
00:22:38,110 --> 00:22:43,110
But it's not always clear that
standard controls is any better.

310
00:22:43,630 --> 00:22:47,350
Uh, or at least especially for
those who are new to accessibility.

311
00:22:47,980 --> 00:22:52,690
So we need to make those status
control easier to discover,

312
00:22:53,260 --> 00:22:54,490
provide guideline.

313
00:22:54,490 --> 00:22:59,490
The two should provide guideline two
engineers on how to create accessibility,

314
00:23:00,790 --> 00:23:01,091
sorry,

315
00:23:01,091 --> 00:23:06,091
accessible and logical layout so that
every controller and every piece of

316
00:23:06,581 --> 00:23:09,310
content in the applications
are on the website,

317
00:23:09,460 --> 00:23:14,460
are properly marked up and can be accessed
with various input devices that is

318
00:23:16,811 --> 00:23:19,150
not,
that are not a mouse base.

319
00:23:20,650 --> 00:23:25,650
The tool should immediately alert
engineers when it detects code that blacks

320
00:23:27,190 --> 00:23:31,570
accessibility property before
compiling if necessary.

321
00:23:32,860 --> 00:23:35,500
The repository of this,
uh,

322
00:23:35,740 --> 00:23:40,740
the tool should also contain the
repository of accessible sample code.

323
00:23:42,700 --> 00:23:45,230
This is going to be
useful for engineers who

324
00:23:47,270 --> 00:23:49,220
are new to accessibility
and what to learn,

325
00:23:49,221 --> 00:23:54,050
how to code in an effective
matter at any given moment.

326
00:23:54,051 --> 00:23:58,490
This ideal tool that I'm talking about
here should be able to provide the

327
00:23:58,491 --> 00:24:03,491
developers and engineers with the ability
to simulate how a piece of code will

328
00:24:04,581 --> 00:24:07,180
function with the various,
uh,

329
00:24:07,190 --> 00:24:12,190
popular access technology product
that people would disability use.

330
00:24:14,370 --> 00:24:19,370
The tool should be able to detect the
logical flow and order of how users use

331
00:24:20,431 --> 00:24:24,180
the product to come to
complete core feature set.

332
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:27,300
And lastly,

333
00:24:27,630 --> 00:24:32,630
we must provide a robust a p I n s d
k so that every developer and every

334
00:24:34,501 --> 00:24:39,450
engineer's everywhere candy below in
an accessible manner. As far as I know,

335
00:24:39,570 --> 00:24:42,930
we had many accessibility tools out there,
but as far as I know,

336
00:24:43,590 --> 00:24:48,590
we don't have a tool that have as
comprehensive as feature set as the one I

337
00:24:48,871 --> 00:24:51,750
described. And if you do
have any, please let me know.

338
00:24:53,310 --> 00:24:56,760
I believe though that with
the use of AI technology,

339
00:24:58,080 --> 00:25:01,380
it is possible for someone
to create such a tool.

340
00:25:02,220 --> 00:25:05,970
Now here's a challenge for you.
Will Google do it first?

341
00:25:06,400 --> 00:25:07,233
Hm.

342
00:25:08,040 --> 00:25:10,020
We'll other player in
the industry do it first.

343
00:25:11,580 --> 00:25:13,680
Now increasing the talent pipeline.

344
00:25:14,120 --> 00:25:19,120
It is important as mentioned for us to
do more as an industry to partner with

345
00:25:21,060 --> 00:25:25,920
educational institutions to elevate
the importance of accessibility,

346
00:25:26,160 --> 00:25:31,160
design study two s an equally level
off important as cyber securities

347
00:25:33,570 --> 00:25:36,420
discipline. You said, wow, really?

348
00:25:36,960 --> 00:25:41,100
Do we really need to get that radical?

349
00:25:41,940 --> 00:25:45,480
Yes we do.
We really do.

350
00:25:46,440 --> 00:25:51,440
Accessibility need to be
viewed as a core feature set.

351
00:25:53,310 --> 00:25:57,680
Many people who graduated from
colleges and university today, um,

352
00:25:58,410 --> 00:26:03,020
especially if they graduated
with a degree in Cybersecurity,

353
00:26:04,230 --> 00:26:08,880
uh, there are celebrated, uh, they
are recognized for their talent.

354
00:26:09,600 --> 00:26:14,600
We need to do the same thing for
people who graduate from colleges and

355
00:26:15,031 --> 00:26:19,350
university today. We'd great
accessibility d design knowledge,

356
00:26:21,060 --> 00:26:26,060
what engineer join a firm with the
require skill set that the forum,

357
00:26:27,181 --> 00:26:32,181
once the company has the obligation to
ensure that he or she have opportunities

358
00:26:33,661 --> 00:26:36,450
to advance and have a
fulfilling career path.

359
00:26:37,950 --> 00:26:40,980
Accessibility engineer
need to be celebrate.

360
00:26:42,090 --> 00:26:47,090
And the success of the engineers who
instrumental and pms for that matter who

361
00:26:47,300 --> 00:26:52,230
instrumental
in developing accessible products

362
00:26:54,510 --> 00:26:55,920
need to be celebrate.

363
00:26:55,921 --> 00:27:00,700
And companies need to
find ways to, to, um,

364
00:27:00,930 --> 00:27:05,930
connect engineers with
individuals who is the,

365
00:27:07,050 --> 00:27:10,460
who are directly benefiting from that,
the application that they created.

366
00:27:10,890 --> 00:27:15,890
I think to me by putting a group of
engineers with people with disability and

367
00:27:16,021 --> 00:27:19,900
listen to the end user,
uh,

368
00:27:19,901 --> 00:27:23,820
on how products they're products that
they create and make it such a difference

369
00:27:23,821 --> 00:27:27,270
in their lives,
the best way to motivate

370
00:27:28,980 --> 00:27:31,650
each other.
And lastly,

371
00:27:31,651 --> 00:27:36,651
we cannot underestimate the value of
a well structured mentoring program,

372
00:27:38,340 --> 00:27:42,450
which ultimately will help facilitate
knowledge transfer among engineers.

373
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:46,230
You know, and pms for that matter.
You know, uh, there's a lot of,

374
00:27:47,470 --> 00:27:47,800
hmm,

375
00:27:47,800 --> 00:27:50,290
you know, for, for whatever reason, uh,

376
00:27:51,190 --> 00:27:55,570
turnover among engineers and pm because
there's tremendous amount of opportunity

377
00:27:55,690 --> 00:27:58,780
across the industry.
But,

378
00:27:58,960 --> 00:28:00,730
but then what happened when,

379
00:28:00,760 --> 00:28:05,350
when excessive and accessibility
champion leaves a company, uh,

380
00:28:05,351 --> 00:28:08,700
where, where those knowledges, I, uh,

381
00:28:08,730 --> 00:28:13,510
has it been preserved anywhere and I
think we should do better as an industry,

382
00:28:13,790 --> 00:28:18,340
uh,
to preserve a knowledge so that engineers,

383
00:28:18,670 --> 00:28:23,670
a new engineers can take advantage of
what has been done in the past if we take

384
00:28:24,191 --> 00:28:26,110
this action.
I honestly feel that

385
00:28:28,610 --> 00:28:32,390
engineers can flourish even
more than they do today.

386
00:28:33,110 --> 00:28:35,060
But before I move on to policy,

387
00:28:36,500 --> 00:28:41,500
I know that my life is enriched by your
work and the work of many engineers and

388
00:28:45,171 --> 00:28:47,810
pm whom I will never
have a chance to meet.

389
00:28:49,370 --> 00:28:53,510
I want to take the time
to thank you.

390
00:28:54,860 --> 00:28:59,860
Thank you for the hard work that you
have put into this to empower people like

391
00:29:00,981 --> 00:29:03,980
me
through your,

392
00:29:04,610 --> 00:29:06,570
through the various
technology that you create.

393
00:29:06,571 --> 00:29:09,980
It I'm able to stay productive
because of your hard work.

394
00:29:10,330 --> 00:29:11,960
So thank you very much for that.

395
00:29:13,340 --> 00:29:18,340
I just paid to you an ideal picture of
how things ought to be if the industry

396
00:29:18,921 --> 00:29:22,310
worked together. But you said, wait a
minute, wait a minute, wait a minute.

397
00:29:22,790 --> 00:29:27,570
We're not there yet and here I am.
I'm looking for ways to uh,

398
00:29:27,860 --> 00:29:30,470
enhance my knowledge and skill today.

399
00:29:31,400 --> 00:29:35,390
Is there anything that I can do or do
I have to wait until somebody else do

400
00:29:35,391 --> 00:29:37,160
something?
No,

401
00:29:37,220 --> 00:29:41,560
I don't think you have to wait and I
would like to recommend the following for

402
00:29:41,561 --> 00:29:42,394
you to consider.

403
00:29:43,660 --> 00:29:47,860
I know Cuco have a robust training
program and everybody else in the industry

404
00:29:47,861 --> 00:29:48,694
should too.

405
00:29:49,210 --> 00:29:53,410
And when that end and the engineers and
pm should take advantage of the training

406
00:29:53,411 --> 00:29:58,390
programs offered by the
respective company. Do not.

407
00:29:58,391 --> 00:30:00,100
Please do not design in the vacuum.

408
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:06,000
Always partner with accessibility subject
matters experts while you're doing

409
00:30:06,011 --> 00:30:09,730
your design work. I, if you do that,

410
00:30:10,570 --> 00:30:14,920
you will have less regret
in the end when possible,

411
00:30:15,280 --> 00:30:20,140
and I know your time is the most
precious commodity, but when possible,

412
00:30:20,141 --> 00:30:24,940
find ways to participate in the ongoing
work of the various accessibility

413
00:30:24,941 --> 00:30:26,530
standard consortium,

414
00:30:26,830 --> 00:30:31,830
either in person or obtain knowledge
online if you can do it in person.

415
00:30:33,611 --> 00:30:38,611
This is great because it is an excellent
way to connect with other experts in

416
00:30:38,651 --> 00:30:39,484
the industry

417
00:30:41,240 --> 00:30:43,760
regularly conduct usability,

418
00:30:43,761 --> 00:30:48,761
product usability testing even when you
feel that your product is compliant and

419
00:30:50,151 --> 00:30:55,151
please conduct your product testing with
people with disability who used access

420
00:30:55,191 --> 00:30:56,510
technology every day.

421
00:30:56,690 --> 00:31:01,690
I know that product
testing can be very costly,

422
00:31:02,001 --> 00:31:04,490
but until we get the right tooling,

423
00:31:05,150 --> 00:31:09,590
we need usability testing and if
you conduct usability testing,

424
00:31:09,591 --> 00:31:14,591
you gained tremendous insight from the
end user with disability that you can't

425
00:31:14,721 --> 00:31:18,110
just glean from the
automated testing tool alone.

426
00:31:19,400 --> 00:31:24,400
Code according to accessibility standard
and do not code according to a specific

427
00:31:25,341 --> 00:31:28,010
type of access technology solution.

428
00:31:28,880 --> 00:31:33,880
This is really important because if you
decided to pivot one way or the other

429
00:31:34,941 --> 00:31:37,850
toward any particular
access technology solutions,

430
00:31:38,240 --> 00:31:43,240
you may break your product when the next
release of that solution came out or

431
00:31:44,510 --> 00:31:49,510
when and you're going to be doing
your work in vain if that a technology

432
00:31:49,611 --> 00:31:52,670
solution decreases in popularity.

433
00:31:54,410 --> 00:31:56,150
Finally,
let's move to policy.

434
00:31:57,770 --> 00:32:02,270
Companies should really think about
established strong inclusive workforce

435
00:32:02,510 --> 00:32:03,021
policy.

436
00:32:03,021 --> 00:32:08,021
I know that none of that Microsoft
is benefited greatly by this.

437
00:32:10,130 --> 00:32:12,710
We are as good as our people

438
00:32:13,360 --> 00:32:14,193
are.

439
00:32:16,060 --> 00:32:19,180
We have to make sure as an the industry

440
00:32:20,460 --> 00:32:21,293
that

441
00:32:22,770 --> 00:32:27,770
the customers who we serve externally
are properly represented by the diverse

442
00:32:30,631 --> 00:32:34,020
pool of employees in our organization.

443
00:32:35,970 --> 00:32:37,650
If we don't do that,

444
00:32:38,160 --> 00:32:43,160
how can we tackle accessibility and
understand the nature of the problem

445
00:32:46,220 --> 00:32:51,220
in the enough depth and breadth so
that we could solve it appropriately?

446
00:32:55,170 --> 00:32:58,320
Always aim high.
I know engineers aim high,

447
00:32:58,920 --> 00:33:03,920
but I am encouraging you to aim even
higher when you create a develop products.

448
00:33:06,710 --> 00:33:11,710
Please use accessibility guideline as it
meant to be used as a minimum benchmark

449
00:33:13,190 --> 00:33:14,270
for accessibility.

450
00:33:14,450 --> 00:33:18,710
Don't ever lose sight of the end goal.

451
00:33:19,780 --> 00:33:24,780
And the end goal is I'll products and
services must be accessible and usable by

452
00:33:25,491 --> 00:33:28,460
everyone.
Finally,

453
00:33:29,630 --> 00:33:34,340
five accessibility champions within
your organization at all level.

454
00:33:34,520 --> 00:33:38,450
Guys, how many people are
here? 10, maybe two. Now,

455
00:33:38,451 --> 00:33:43,070
I don't know how many of them
walk out. Um, but anyway,

456
00:33:43,110 --> 00:33:47,960
that's all. Okay, well, hey weekend
too. How about that? Um, but anyhow,

457
00:33:47,990 --> 00:33:48,823
um,

458
00:33:49,100 --> 00:33:53,960
you can make a difference even within
a behemoth company like Google,

459
00:33:54,440 --> 00:33:59,440
if you were so committed to accessibility
to begin to work together across all

460
00:33:59,451 --> 00:34:00,284
level,

461
00:34:01,130 --> 00:34:06,130
top down and bottom up and
everywhere else in the company.

462
00:34:07,100 --> 00:34:08,690
If we take this seriously,

463
00:34:09,500 --> 00:34:14,500
I think that it is possible to have an
accessible product with every release.

464
00:34:18,260 --> 00:34:22,970
So I really feel strongly that we at
a cost of something great is about to

465
00:34:22,971 --> 00:34:25,460
happen.
10 years ago,

466
00:34:25,470 --> 00:34:29,270
accessibility was a word to avoid.

467
00:34:30,440 --> 00:34:35,300
Uh, it's, it's a, um, some people said, oh
gosh, do we really have to deal with this?

468
00:34:35,360 --> 00:34:39,560
I guess, suppose so, because
otherwise we, we might be in trouble.

469
00:34:39,561 --> 00:34:42,500
We might be litigated against today.

470
00:34:43,250 --> 00:34:46,760
Accessibility is no longer as a mandate,

471
00:34:46,761 --> 00:34:51,320
but it's becoming something that people
are welcome and to becoming something

472
00:34:51,321 --> 00:34:54,050
that people really want to
move forward with it. So,

473
00:34:54,260 --> 00:34:58,130
but it's going to take everybody.
It's going to take the end community.

474
00:34:58,131 --> 00:35:02,150
Partnering with you is going to
take the commitment from your part.

475
00:35:02,390 --> 00:35:06,740
It's going to take everybody to move
accessibility forward and one day when you

476
00:35:06,760 --> 00:35:10,760
grade, oh, I just want to warn
you, you're going to get there.

477
00:35:11,750 --> 00:35:14,630
And when you have to use glasses,
uh,

478
00:35:14,631 --> 00:35:18,110
some of you may encounter,
um,

479
00:35:18,620 --> 00:35:21,050
situational disability.
You know,

480
00:35:21,230 --> 00:35:24,910
those of you especially who are
really active and playing sport,

481
00:35:24,930 --> 00:35:29,390
you may have to wear crutches and stuff
one day just because you break a leg or

482
00:35:29,391 --> 00:35:32,660
something.
And to Kim,

483
00:35:32,661 --> 00:35:35,450
you'll productive during those
time will be very, very important.

484
00:35:35,451 --> 00:35:38,630
And one day you're going to look
back and said, know what you find?

485
00:35:38,631 --> 00:35:41,430
Count any disability with a
permanently or temporarily.

486
00:35:43,080 --> 00:35:48,080
I don't have to worry about losing my
productivity because technologies are

487
00:35:50,011 --> 00:35:51,270
created to be accessible.

488
00:35:51,990 --> 00:35:56,130
So I asked for your commitment
and I'm giving it to you

489
00:35:57,660 --> 00:36:00,480
that I will always be an
accessibility advocate.

490
00:36:00,481 --> 00:36:05,481
And I hope that I'm able to inspire
you or at least give you something,

491
00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:10,760
thought provoking to go and really examine
your own commitment to accessibility.

492
00:36:12,090 --> 00:36:17,090
And I'm hoping to see you and meet with
you 10 years from now and recount the

493
00:36:17,131 --> 00:36:21,930
progress that I've just done
early on in this presentation.

494
00:36:23,370 --> 00:36:26,760
All of the various accessibility
improvement, Ashley, you know, what,

495
00:36:26,820 --> 00:36:29,790
10 or 15 years from now, we shouldn't
be talking about this topic anymore.

496
00:36:30,240 --> 00:36:31,980
It should be matter of course.

497
00:36:32,790 --> 00:36:36,060
So I thank you for your time
and I'll entertain annotated
question that you have.

498
00:36:40,350 --> 00:36:43,620
Um, okay. So something that came to mind,

499
00:36:43,750 --> 00:36:48,080
uh, during your talk, how to do
with prioritizing accessibility.

500
00:36:48,740 --> 00:36:52,530
This is always a challenge for
every product in every team, um,

501
00:36:53,030 --> 00:36:56,630
especially when you have
deadlines and other,

502
00:36:56,690 --> 00:37:01,040
other scary things that are happening at
the same time. How, in your experience,

503
00:37:01,100 --> 00:37:05,930
maybe you can give a few examples of
ways that you've been able to champion

504
00:37:05,931 --> 00:37:09,140
accessibility in a,
in a tight environment like that.

505
00:37:09,810 --> 00:37:14,060
Sure. Um, I can't, well, let me,

506
00:37:14,080 --> 00:37:15,090
let me just do it this way.

507
00:37:17,480 --> 00:37:20,950
I think we have telemetries,
uh,

508
00:37:21,650 --> 00:37:25,950
on how our products are used, or at least
I hope you do. And I think you do a,

509
00:37:26,150 --> 00:37:31,150
we know what core features are a four
sided and for the blind and for everybody.

510
00:37:33,950 --> 00:37:38,390
And I would start there. What are
the core features in your products?

511
00:37:39,380 --> 00:37:44,300
And you make that accessible.
If you really have to prioritize first,

512
00:37:44,480 --> 00:37:48,700
you make that,
then those features accessible and,

513
00:37:49,460 --> 00:37:51,440
and, and, and then you
go from there. It's,

514
00:37:51,470 --> 00:37:55,190
I don't think it's rocket
science about this, um,

515
00:37:55,730 --> 00:37:58,620
because people, uh, and,

516
00:37:58,650 --> 00:38:02,330
and I don't mean to be
condescending in any way about this.

517
00:38:02,360 --> 00:38:03,680
I think

518
00:38:03,710 --> 00:38:06,920
everybody have the same needs.

519
00:38:06,950 --> 00:38:10,130
We just access information
in a different way.

520
00:38:11,990 --> 00:38:15,830
Does it help at all with
respect to a specific example?

521
00:38:17,090 --> 00:38:17,923
Um,

522
00:38:22,440 --> 00:38:27,240
I'll talk about a product that actually
created an accessibility community,

523
00:38:27,470 --> 00:38:30,860
uh, rather than, um, uh,

524
00:38:31,590 --> 00:38:33,750
current Microsoft product.
Um,

525
00:38:33,840 --> 00:38:37,990
and the parallel analogy will
be a very much identical.

526
00:38:38,560 --> 00:38:43,560
So we were looking at ways to create
a portable book reader for the blind,

527
00:38:44,220 --> 00:38:47,800
uh, in my work with a company
named human where, I don't know,

528
00:38:47,801 --> 00:38:52,390
in a 2007, 2006 or something, uh,

529
00:38:52,391 --> 00:38:56,780
and we want to make that,
uh,

530
00:38:56,990 --> 00:38:58,240
we'll play,
are accessible.

531
00:38:58,241 --> 00:39:01,600
When we started to evaluate
what are some core features

532
00:39:03,190 --> 00:39:07,800
of a digital book reader. I remember back
then, digital book reader are quite, uh,

533
00:39:07,830 --> 00:39:12,560
new. Uh, and so we spent some
time looking at what, uh,

534
00:39:12,610 --> 00:39:17,610
the mainstream industry is doing and
then we bring that features into,

535
00:39:18,260 --> 00:39:19,630
uh,
the development.

536
00:39:20,320 --> 00:39:23,680
And the result was one
of the most popular,

537
00:39:23,710 --> 00:39:26,360
still is one of the most
popular stand alone,

538
00:39:26,630 --> 00:39:30,760
a digital book reader for the blind called
the victor reader stream, which are,

539
00:39:31,090 --> 00:39:35,180
it's one of the most exciting
project that I got a chance to,

540
00:39:35,240 --> 00:39:39,010
to partner with various engineers
because we designed everything from the,

541
00:39:39,310 --> 00:39:40,143
from the ground up,

542
00:39:40,930 --> 00:39:45,850
and we wrestled with this priorities
every day. And you do too.

543
00:39:45,851 --> 00:39:50,851
So I would say use your telemetry is
that you have available to you and make

544
00:39:51,401 --> 00:39:56,110
sure those core feature sets are
accessible first. That's great.

545
00:39:56,111 --> 00:40:00,840
Thanks. Cool. Oh, do you my question?

546
00:40:02,630 --> 00:40:03,463
Great.

547
00:40:06,610 --> 00:40:10,750
So my name is Dasha and I'm a developer
on maps. Uh, before asked me a question,

548
00:40:10,751 --> 00:40:14,080
I actually want to turn to the
audience a lot of the things and um,

549
00:40:14,410 --> 00:40:16,720
and talked about actually
we have internally.

550
00:40:16,721 --> 00:40:18,540
So in order for your product to shape him,

551
00:40:18,550 --> 00:40:22,210
you must pass to given gardening and
we have a guard discussion this week,

552
00:40:22,211 --> 00:40:24,040
so you're welcome to join us for that.

553
00:40:24,280 --> 00:40:27,160
We also have classes running this
week because it is a stability week.

554
00:40:27,310 --> 00:40:28,570
So educate yourself.

555
00:40:28,630 --> 00:40:32,800
There's an Ios and android in a design
class happening this week, so you're very,

556
00:40:32,801 --> 00:40:36,100
very welcome to come.
And my question is actually around Ui.

557
00:40:36,370 --> 00:40:37,690
When you were describing your

558
00:40:39,190 --> 00:40:42,620
perfect tool or our SDK,
um,

559
00:40:42,670 --> 00:40:46,210
it made me wonder that we don't even
have that for regular stuff. I mean,

560
00:40:46,240 --> 00:40:49,900
there is not one place where you can build
the Ui depending on what platform you

561
00:40:49,901 --> 00:40:54,580
are, you're stuck with that platforms.
Um, good and bad points, right?

562
00:40:55,050 --> 00:40:56,620
So I think,
uh,

563
00:40:56,621 --> 00:40:59,380
I don't know if that will ever happen
to have one place where you can build Ui

564
00:40:59,381 --> 00:41:00,910
and works on everything. Right? Right.

565
00:41:00,911 --> 00:41:04,420
Now you build Ui for this platform and
then for that platform then for that

566
00:41:04,421 --> 00:41:05,254
platform,

567
00:41:05,500 --> 00:41:08,680
mostly because otherwise
you can't leverage the best
parts of a given platform.

568
00:41:09,030 --> 00:41:11,470
Um, what do you think about that? Well,

569
00:41:14,140 --> 00:41:17,110
we must work with what we
have so far, right? I mean,

570
00:41:17,111 --> 00:41:19,810
I honestly feel that if
I have this magic tool,

571
00:41:19,811 --> 00:41:24,811
they can split code out in all platforms
and ensure accessibility of everything

572
00:41:26,291 --> 00:41:30,040
everywhere at the same time. That
would be best. But when, when we,

573
00:41:30,610 --> 00:41:35,060
now we don't, so let me give you
an example. In android platform

574
00:41:37,320 --> 00:41:38,153
you really

575
00:41:39,210 --> 00:41:43,950
need to think hard about how people
with disability use technologies.

576
00:41:44,160 --> 00:41:48,780
So what are an important
characteristic of attributes?

577
00:41:49,410 --> 00:41:50,243
Uh,

578
00:41:50,960 --> 00:41:55,760
oh, feature sets that are, uh,
to, to them, uh, as an example,

579
00:41:57,050 --> 00:42:01,460
I don't know, this is, I think this is
correct. Uh, last I checked is correct.

580
00:42:01,461 --> 00:42:05,080
So if it's not correct, I want
you to correct me. Uh, Andrew,

581
00:42:05,081 --> 00:42:09,080
I know get tremendous amount
of accessibility improvement.

582
00:42:10,730 --> 00:42:13,250
But currently if you develop

583
00:42:13,770 --> 00:42:14,603
mmm,

584
00:42:15,240 --> 00:42:17,430
a webpage,
a correctly,

585
00:42:18,480 --> 00:42:19,250
uh,

586
00:42:19,250 --> 00:42:23,590
with proper table mock
ups, it in html, uh,

587
00:42:23,640 --> 00:42:24,650
you cannot,

588
00:42:25,640 --> 00:42:30,640
you can still not use and android no
good with top back to take advantage of

589
00:42:31,851 --> 00:42:36,530
that mockup.
So you still have to traverse table,

590
00:42:36,531 --> 00:42:41,120
cell by cell and you know how
tedious that think get. So

591
00:42:43,070 --> 00:42:48,070
if you understand that people
with disability want to
traverse table in the way

592
00:42:49,131 --> 00:42:54,131
that you do go column by column skip
columns and we need to skip roles and we

593
00:42:54,681 --> 00:42:58,020
must then in uh,

594
00:42:58,160 --> 00:43:01,310
our API around development a framework,

595
00:43:01,311 --> 00:43:05,900
we should give the ability for the
APP developers to do just that.

596
00:43:07,460 --> 00:43:11,260
That's what I meant when I
say we really need to, uh,

597
00:43:12,830 --> 00:43:16,770
consider the needs of customers even,
uh,

598
00:43:16,910 --> 00:43:21,110
throughout the designing
process. Does it help? Yeah.

599
00:43:21,310 --> 00:43:25,060
So rather than a two, a one to
one, what I'm hearing you say,

600
00:43:25,061 --> 00:43:27,910
each platform should do better,
should care more.

601
00:43:28,780 --> 00:43:31,810
Well, [inaudible] tools
is important, right?

602
00:43:31,840 --> 00:43:36,640
So if you provide necessary a
tutorial in the tool and said,

603
00:43:36,641 --> 00:43:37,390
hey,

604
00:43:37,390 --> 00:43:42,390
guess what developers now you can take
advantage of table mock ups and Itch to

605
00:43:42,490 --> 00:43:47,190
Mellon. Here's how you do, here's
how you do your development. Uh, it,

606
00:43:47,230 --> 00:43:47,960
it's,
it's,

607
00:43:47,960 --> 00:43:52,210
if the tool has that feature set that
will give guidance to engineers and

608
00:43:52,211 --> 00:43:56,370
developers, that would be even
better. I don't remember that. A,

609
00:43:56,420 --> 00:44:00,370
a t access technology simulations
that I was talking about. Uh,

610
00:44:00,371 --> 00:44:04,020
I don't think anybody has it,
but if you were to create, uh,

611
00:44:04,540 --> 00:44:09,100
a content and then you
render it into an html table,

612
00:44:09,101 --> 00:44:11,560
you can immediately see what the behavior

613
00:44:13,900 --> 00:44:18,900
of navigating that table with talk back
and Braille back and such like right

614
00:44:18,911 --> 00:44:23,020
there in the tool. I know I'm dreaming,
but I really think it can happen.

615
00:44:23,980 --> 00:44:26,920
I really do.
Somebody somewhere is going to make this.

616
00:44:28,800 --> 00:44:32,230
Thank you.
I'm Wilson

617
00:44:32,350 --> 00:44:37,270
working or the, uh, uh, enterprise,
uh, how fronted. So like, um,

618
00:44:37,300 --> 00:44:40,660
we've been testing our products with the
various degree readers, like, you know,

619
00:44:40,661 --> 00:44:45,250
like [inaudible] to be more like the
primary ones. And then I'm surprised.

620
00:44:45,380 --> 00:44:49,080
I'm just kidding. And then, um,
and then we also, we also use a,

621
00:44:49,081 --> 00:44:53,290
a voiceover and then lead a NBDA
yeah. To test it. Uh, but, uh,

622
00:44:53,291 --> 00:44:55,990
is there any like effort, uh, you know,

623
00:44:56,320 --> 00:44:59,260
put into standardize all of
these screen reader is still,

624
00:44:59,530 --> 00:45:01,480
so there was less surprised that we,

625
00:45:01,580 --> 00:45:06,550
we turn to another screen reader and
behave totally differently. For example,

626
00:45:06,551 --> 00:45:09,920
voiceover, it was like, you know,
there are a lot of cases that I just,

627
00:45:09,930 --> 00:45:10,763
it just doesn't work.

628
00:45:11,470 --> 00:45:12,710
There's a lot of nuances.

629
00:45:15,580 --> 00:45:17,590
I don't know all the concentrate efforts.

630
00:45:18,720 --> 00:45:19,140
Yeah.

631
00:45:19,140 --> 00:45:20,520
Uh, it, it needs to happen.

632
00:45:21,360 --> 00:45:24,300
And then one of the things that we can
do is code according to sensibilities

633
00:45:24,350 --> 00:45:29,030
that if everybody does that,
and I think we can unify a,

634
00:45:29,220 --> 00:45:30,810
some of the different, uh, you know,

635
00:45:30,811 --> 00:45:35,370
the unified the differences
and make it, uh, less so.

636
00:45:36,370 --> 00:45:41,370
A M I a t a I know when to under
compensated and overcompensating for worth

637
00:45:43,741 --> 00:45:44,101
weapons,

638
00:45:44,101 --> 00:45:47,430
disability or any accessibility standard
that makes it very difficult for

639
00:45:47,790 --> 00:45:48,990
developer to develop.

640
00:45:48,991 --> 00:45:53,460
Now I also understand the 80 manufacturers
predicament though they need to serve

641
00:45:53,461 --> 00:45:56,310
customers.
So here again,

642
00:45:56,490 --> 00:45:58,950
partnership between you and a t,

643
00:45:59,310 --> 00:46:00,143
uh,

644
00:46:00,650 --> 00:46:05,180
solution providers, whether it would
be your peers, uh, Microsoft, uh,

645
00:46:05,420 --> 00:46:09,650
apple. I'll even bode potty
a t. It needs to happen

646
00:46:10,060 --> 00:46:12,130
more and I'm,

647
00:46:13,110 --> 00:46:16,140
I would love to hear your thought
on how we can bring this about too.

648
00:46:16,141 --> 00:46:20,490
This is not just my conversation to you.
This is a bi directional conversation.

649
00:46:20,820 --> 00:46:24,180
So you have some ideas. Uh,
Anna, how to get in touch,

650
00:46:24,210 --> 00:46:26,340
knows how to get in touch with me.
Please let me know.

651
00:46:28,640 --> 00:46:29,473
Okay.

652
00:46:30,960 --> 00:46:35,910
I'm being kicked out. I think we are
actually been kicked up. Thank you, Anne,

653
00:46:35,911 --> 00:46:38,160
for coming.
A wonderful Todd.
