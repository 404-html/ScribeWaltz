1
00:00:06,090 --> 00:00:10,620
Thanks everybody for coming. I just
want to introduce a Emma Yang. Uh,

2
00:00:10,621 --> 00:00:14,580
she is a 14 year olds, a
ninth grade student, uh,

3
00:00:14,581 --> 00:00:18,570
here in New York and she has been coding
since she was about six years old. Uh,

4
00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:21,720
she's a multiple award winner
for various different things.

5
00:00:21,721 --> 00:00:24,360
She is a published writer, which I
think she's going to tell you about.

6
00:00:24,830 --> 00:00:28,380
And she's working on a new APP called
timeless, which is designed for a,

7
00:00:29,230 --> 00:00:30,500
um,
uh,

8
00:00:30,510 --> 00:00:34,410
Alzheimer's patients to be able to
live a little bit more independently.

9
00:00:34,411 --> 00:00:37,620
So I'm just gonna, um,
without further ado, Emma.

10
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:40,193
Thank you.

11
00:00:43,490 --> 00:00:44,840
Hi.
So my name is Emma Yang.

12
00:00:44,900 --> 00:00:48,440
I'm 14 years old and a freshman in
high school and I'm also the founder of

13
00:00:48,441 --> 00:00:52,610
timeless. So a bit about
myself. I love to bike.

14
00:00:52,880 --> 00:00:56,360
I also love cats, but my family can't
have a cat because we travel a lot.

15
00:00:56,361 --> 00:01:01,340
So I imagine that I'm a cat and
a Volvo. I love to code. Uh,

16
00:01:01,370 --> 00:01:03,080
but that wasn't how everything started.

17
00:01:03,170 --> 00:01:06,230
I actually was never groomed
to be a math or a tech was.

18
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:09,860
My mom always wanted me
to be a writer. Um, we,

19
00:01:09,861 --> 00:01:13,760
I'm from like a house full of
engineers and mathematicians.

20
00:01:13,790 --> 00:01:18,470
So we needed a historian or a writer, she
said, and that's how it was initially.

21
00:01:18,920 --> 00:01:22,370
Um, here is a video of me at
a book launch reading a book.

22
00:01:22,371 --> 00:01:23,350
I was published in [inaudible]

23
00:01:25,020 --> 00:01:29,950
and Emma will be reading the
diary, a hobby, the rabbit.

24
00:01:36,520 --> 00:01:38,570
I'm happy as a parent

25
00:01:40,350 --> 00:01:44,260
and the garden to the other
side of the forest to play.

26
00:01:44,610 --> 00:01:46,730
We played tag was

27
00:01:48,420 --> 00:01:53,100
back to my house to have lunch.
I introduced to my family.

28
00:01:56,330 --> 00:01:57,560
I was happened to

29
00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:01,233
thank you.

30
00:02:05,380 --> 00:02:07,900
So that was what I was
around five or six years old.

31
00:02:08,290 --> 00:02:13,000
I was quite a writer and my work was
actually published in a couple of books

32
00:02:13,001 --> 00:02:14,740
that are still being sold in Hong Kong.

33
00:02:17,190 --> 00:02:21,330
Then one day my dad put me in front
of a computer and showed me scratch,

34
00:02:21,331 --> 00:02:24,720
which is where you can drag
and drop different blocks
of code to make a program.

35
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:28,860
And I instantly fell in love with
it and I was coding with an hour's.

36
00:02:28,861 --> 00:02:32,660
I was amazed by the extraordinary range
of things you could do with a couple of

37
00:02:32,670 --> 00:02:37,050
blocks of code. It didn't matter whether
it is an application, a game or tool,

38
00:02:37,380 --> 00:02:39,840
a w whether it was simple or complex.

39
00:02:39,841 --> 00:02:43,830
It was my own personal creation that
was unique and special and that I could

40
00:02:43,831 --> 00:02:47,460
share with the rest of the world.
This is what motivated me to progress.

41
00:02:47,461 --> 00:02:50,070
They're building websites,
mobile apps and more.

42
00:02:51,820 --> 00:02:56,170
Then in the summer of 2015 when
I was around 11 years old, I uh,

43
00:02:56,380 --> 00:02:58,660
participated in something called
the technovation challenge,

44
00:02:58,900 --> 00:03:01,600
which is a girls'
entrepreneurship technology,

45
00:03:01,750 --> 00:03:04,480
a competition that encourages
girls to pursue stem.

46
00:03:05,020 --> 00:03:07,330
I developed an APP called
Concussion Checker,

47
00:03:07,331 --> 00:03:10,650
which is an easy way for
people to evaluate head injury.

48
00:03:10,651 --> 00:03:12,220
So the possibility of concussion

49
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:18,490
developing this APP and the company
business plan for the competition was my

50
00:03:18,491 --> 00:03:22,990
springboard into a whole different level
of technology using tech to help my

51
00:03:22,991 --> 00:03:25,390
community and solve real world problems.

52
00:03:25,810 --> 00:03:28,990
I realized that even though I was 11
years old and a middle school student,

53
00:03:29,290 --> 00:03:30,580
I could create apps,

54
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:34,810
products that had meaningful
functionalities to impact
and benefit people from

55
00:03:34,811 --> 00:03:37,270
around the world.
We got to the finals,

56
00:03:37,300 --> 00:03:40,030
we went to San Francisco and
won second place globally.

57
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:42,820
Even though receiving the
award was a really amazing,

58
00:03:42,880 --> 00:03:46,660
it was the discovery of a whole
community of girls and women who had

59
00:03:46,661 --> 00:03:49,930
groundbreaking ideas that could change
the world that I cherish the most.

60
00:03:50,440 --> 00:03:52,270
It changed my entire perspective.

61
00:03:54,650 --> 00:03:55,350
Yeah.

62
00:03:55,350 --> 00:03:58,470
This is my grandma when I was
around seven or eight years old.

63
00:03:58,471 --> 00:04:02,190
She forgot my birthday, but we thought
she was just being a little forgetful,

64
00:04:02,520 --> 00:04:05,850
but then she forgot how old I was,
what she had just had for dinner,

65
00:04:06,060 --> 00:04:09,540
how would turn the TV.
She lost track of time and so much more.

66
00:04:09,630 --> 00:04:12,510
Some of the common difficulties
faced by Alzheimer's patients.

67
00:04:14,210 --> 00:04:15,680
My grandma is not alone.

68
00:04:15,710 --> 00:04:19,220
There are 50 million people worldwide
who suffer from Alzheimer's.

69
00:04:19,550 --> 00:04:23,450
By 2050 that number is expected
to rise to 130 million.

70
00:04:23,780 --> 00:04:26,330
Prevalence is on the rise,
but there is no cure.

71
00:04:27,890 --> 00:04:28,723
Yeah,

72
00:04:28,750 --> 00:04:29,860
like my grandmother,

73
00:04:30,020 --> 00:04:33,790
people who have Alzheimer's often
have difficulty remembering events,

74
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,530
taking a new information,

75
00:04:35,531 --> 00:04:39,400
recognizing people and places
and separating fact from fiction.

76
00:04:40,790 --> 00:04:41,030
Okay,

77
00:04:41,030 --> 00:04:42,380
so as the disease progressed,

78
00:04:42,381 --> 00:04:45,110
we would set up visual aids
around my grandma's house to help.

79
00:04:45,111 --> 00:04:49,220
Remember we continued to send her photos
of us and hopes that she remember us

80
00:04:49,221 --> 00:04:53,810
for as long as possible to what you see
here on the right is a picture of the

81
00:04:53,811 --> 00:04:55,970
whiteboard that we put in
my grandma's living room.

82
00:04:56,390 --> 00:05:00,350
Where you have on top is my dad's phone
number and the middle is the phone

83
00:05:00,351 --> 00:05:03,950
number of the person she needs
to visit as well as the address.

84
00:05:04,340 --> 00:05:06,320
And on the bottom it
says Sunday in Chinese,

85
00:05:06,321 --> 00:05:08,020
which is the day that those taken on.

86
00:05:08,750 --> 00:05:13,220
On the left you have the iPad that she
uses to look at the photos that we sent

87
00:05:13,221 --> 00:05:14,054
her.

88
00:05:14,150 --> 00:05:18,530
And so as time went by I started to wonder
whether there is a simple mobile app

89
00:05:18,531 --> 00:05:21,710
that could help my grandmother and
other Alzheimer's patients or dementia

90
00:05:21,711 --> 00:05:25,970
patients to remember events,
stay engaged with friends and family,

91
00:05:26,330 --> 00:05:30,410
and to recognize the people around them
in the same way that all of the things

92
00:05:30,411 --> 00:05:32,600
we set up for her would help her remember.

93
00:05:36,220 --> 00:05:39,820
So research suggests that stimulating
one's memory and socializing,

94
00:05:39,821 --> 00:05:44,740
especially by using a mobile app or a
computer, can actually help to stay, uh,

95
00:05:44,741 --> 00:05:48,130
to stay, engage with loved ones and look
at photos can actually help to slow down

96
00:05:48,131 --> 00:05:49,120
cognitive decline.

97
00:05:50,310 --> 00:05:50,560
Okay.

98
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:54,970
So my family hunted extensively for such
an APP that we were sure must exist,

99
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:58,610
but we came away disappointed
because in fact it didn't.

100
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:00,590
There are many tools out there,

101
00:06:00,591 --> 00:06:04,760
but none of them actually help patients
improve their daily lives. In fact,

102
00:06:05,030 --> 00:06:05,721
in general,

103
00:06:05,721 --> 00:06:09,530
I'm very few apps are developed for the
elderly due to the stereotype that's old

104
00:06:09,531 --> 00:06:10,820
people can't use technology.

105
00:06:11,210 --> 00:06:14,750
So right around that time I started
learning how to code with swift and Ios

106
00:06:14,751 --> 00:06:15,770
programming language.

107
00:06:16,100 --> 00:06:19,040
So I took the matter into my own
hands and developed timeless.

108
00:06:19,820 --> 00:06:23,750
So what is timeless?
Timeless is a first of its kind.

109
00:06:23,751 --> 00:06:28,730
Caregiver assisted a simple APP for
Alzheimer's patients to help them remember

110
00:06:28,731 --> 00:06:32,510
events, stay in connected and
engaged the friends and family,

111
00:06:32,930 --> 00:06:36,380
and to help them recognize the people
around them using artificial intelligence,

112
00:06:36,381 --> 00:06:38,240
space to facial recognition technology.

113
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:42,080
It addresses all of the challenge faced
by Alzheimer's patients in one single

114
00:06:42,081 --> 00:06:42,914
tool.

115
00:06:44,840 --> 00:06:49,730
So there are four phase one core features
for updates, helps patients stay,

116
00:06:49,731 --> 00:06:54,300
engage with loved ones by showing a stream
of photos sent by friends and family

117
00:06:54,301 --> 00:06:55,310
through a timeless.

118
00:06:55,760 --> 00:06:59,120
Each of the photos are tagged with the
names and relationships with the people

119
00:06:59,420 --> 00:07:01,460
to help the patient
stimulate their memory.

120
00:07:02,510 --> 00:07:06,950
Today is simplified daily information
and events to help the patient manage so

121
00:07:06,951 --> 00:07:07,784
do the lives.

122
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:13,600
Contacts is a picture phone book that
helps patients to contact their friends

123
00:07:13,671 --> 00:07:17,660
and family by simply tapping on call
or text without having to remember any

124
00:07:17,661 --> 00:07:18,494
phone numbers.

125
00:07:19,160 --> 00:07:23,330
Then finally identify is where the
patient can use the photos at the phone's

126
00:07:23,331 --> 00:07:27,950
camera to take a picture of someone's
face that's in real life or an actual

127
00:07:27,951 --> 00:07:29,780
physical photo and timeless.

128
00:07:29,781 --> 00:07:32,120
We use the Fisher recognition
to tell them who that is.

129
00:07:34,010 --> 00:07:35,660
So let me show you a
quick demo of the APP.

130
00:07:36,850 --> 00:07:38,410
Users sign into timeless.

131
00:07:38,420 --> 00:07:41,910
You touch id or face id
passwords are not needed.

132
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:46,180
Once the patient logs in timeless,
bring us up to the home screen.

133
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:50,950
There are five main features I'll take
you through each one of them starting

134
00:07:50,951 --> 00:07:51,880
with updates.

135
00:07:53,020 --> 00:07:55,990
UPDATES is a feeder for central
Centrify friends and family.

136
00:07:56,560 --> 00:08:00,280
Each of the photos is tagged with the
names of the people in the photos by

137
00:08:00,281 --> 00:08:04,870
facial recognition.
Next is today,

138
00:08:04,900 --> 00:08:09,310
which is a daily overview including the
date, whether and next event of the day.

139
00:08:10,060 --> 00:08:14,500
This helps the patient remember
activities and appointments, photos.

140
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:16,660
She was pictures sent
by friends and family.

141
00:08:17,170 --> 00:08:21,370
The photos are grouped by person by
facial recognition to help the patient

142
00:08:21,371 --> 00:08:23,560
refresh their memory in recognize friends.

143
00:08:23,890 --> 00:08:25,660
I learned them look at photos regularly.

144
00:08:27,250 --> 00:08:31,030
Contacts helps patients who
have difficulty remembering
phone numbers and other

145
00:08:31,031 --> 00:08:31,990
contact information.

146
00:08:32,800 --> 00:08:36,160
The patient can simply tap on
call or cacs to contact someone.

147
00:08:36,900 --> 00:08:39,520
Pamela's we'll all through remind the
patient at the same person that's been

148
00:08:39,521 --> 00:08:41,260
called less than five minutes ago.

149
00:08:45,470 --> 00:08:47,570
I can defy is the key feature of the APP.

150
00:08:48,040 --> 00:08:51,920
Patients often have can have difficulty
recognizing the people around them. Well,

151
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,270
they identified the patient.

152
00:08:53,271 --> 00:08:56,880
You'd take a picture of the person and
Thomas will use facial recognition to

153
00:08:56,881 --> 00:08:57,714
recognize that

154
00:09:03,860 --> 00:09:08,030
the APP is managed by the caregiver who
helps enter events into the patient's

155
00:09:08,031 --> 00:09:12,710
calendar and invites friends and relatives
to join the patients. Timeless Circle

156
00:09:16,270 --> 00:09:20,290
for friends and family sharing photos
with the patient is as easy as taking a

157
00:09:20,291 --> 00:09:22,360
picture and sharing it with the chat.

158
00:09:27,060 --> 00:09:30,060
I must works on both iPhones and iPads.

159
00:09:33,950 --> 00:09:37,370
So what'd you saw in the demo video was
an app that was under development with

160
00:09:37,371 --> 00:09:41,000
the support of expert partners such
as Doctor Melissa cramps who is an

161
00:09:41,001 --> 00:09:45,450
Alzheimer's specialist at New York's
Pescetarian Lulea men Adreno who isn't

162
00:09:45,500 --> 00:09:48,080
human experience designer and Kairos,

163
00:09:48,081 --> 00:09:50,690
which is a human analytics
startup based in Miami.

164
00:09:52,420 --> 00:09:56,710
A timeless has also gone
a lot of worldwide press
coverage from you at the u s

165
00:09:56,711 --> 00:10:01,711
to Malaysia to Mexico to Spain and has
also garnered a really wide reach on

166
00:10:02,201 --> 00:10:07,201
social media are demo video has reached
over 36,000 views and within a year.

167
00:10:07,990 --> 00:10:11,860
And we've also gone overwhelming
feedback from Facebook and Twitter.

168
00:10:13,710 --> 00:10:17,490
So the APP is currently under development
and we've recently revamped the UI to

169
00:10:17,491 --> 00:10:20,310
make it more elderly friendly
and cutting up the front end.

170
00:10:20,610 --> 00:10:24,990
And now I'm developing the back end and
should be completing the APP by the mid

171
00:10:24,990 --> 00:10:26,940
this year.
So once phase one is completed,

172
00:10:26,970 --> 00:10:31,970
I plan to roll out to pilot a pilot to
users to collect feedback and to continue

173
00:10:32,071 --> 00:10:33,470
developing interface too.

174
00:10:34,970 --> 00:10:39,970
So phase two would include
music gamification to allow
the paid caregivers to

175
00:10:40,521 --> 00:10:45,230
ask the patient questions through
Trivia and games and also multilingual

176
00:10:45,231 --> 00:10:47,420
capabilities in Spanish and Chinese.

177
00:10:49,810 --> 00:10:53,500
So phase one is foundational.
Phase two is my short term goals,

178
00:10:53,800 --> 00:10:58,450
but research also suggests that language
and mobile usage could help to predict

179
00:10:58,750 --> 00:11:00,730
if someone showed signs of Alzheimer's.

180
00:11:01,240 --> 00:11:04,390
So that brings us to one of my
longterm goals for timeless,

181
00:11:04,391 --> 00:11:09,391
which is whether we can use timeless as
a research platform to collect data for

182
00:11:09,780 --> 00:11:10,960
on mobile usage.

183
00:11:11,140 --> 00:11:14,890
So by monitoring and tracking a non
Alzheimer's patient and an Alzheimer's

184
00:11:14,891 --> 00:11:18,640
patient's activities, navigation,
eye movements and et Cetera,

185
00:11:18,970 --> 00:11:23,800
we can actually maybe find
signs of Alzheimer's or we
could use machine learning

186
00:11:23,801 --> 00:11:28,660
algorithms to detect Alzheimer's disease.
Earlier, the possibilities are endless.

187
00:11:30,450 --> 00:11:30,650
Okay.

188
00:11:30,650 --> 00:11:34,280
So my most pressing need right now is
to scale the development and to drive

189
00:11:34,281 --> 00:11:38,630
adoption. The success of the APP depends
on how many people were able to help.

190
00:11:39,140 --> 00:11:43,580
So Dr Carry Greenfield at
the Comprehensive Center
for Brainhealth and Florida

191
00:11:43,581 --> 00:11:48,050
Atlantic University has agreed to give
feedback on the APP and also to be the

192
00:11:48,051 --> 00:11:52,760
first site to offer the APP to its
patients. We need more of those sites.

193
00:11:55,090 --> 00:12:00,090
I've also recently pushed
out a crowdfunding campaign
on Indiegogo to support

194
00:12:00,161 --> 00:12:01,870
the continued development of timeless.

195
00:12:02,140 --> 00:12:05,500
I'm a full time student so I
can't work on this all alone.

196
00:12:05,560 --> 00:12:08,890
So the best way to scale and speed
of development is to collaborate with

197
00:12:08,891 --> 00:12:10,570
developers to help to grow timeless.

198
00:12:10,571 --> 00:12:12,490
So please help to spread
word about the campaign.

199
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:18,760
So Thomas has also been getting a lot of
media coverage and including in between

200
00:12:18,761 --> 00:12:20,680
from Bill Gates that I got last Friday.

201
00:12:21,010 --> 00:12:24,400
And so all this attention really attests
to how many people will benefit from

202
00:12:24,401 --> 00:12:24,701
this.

203
00:12:24,701 --> 00:12:28,360
And I'm so excited to see this develop
into something that will help so many

204
00:12:28,361 --> 00:12:30,070
people in the Alzheimer's community.

205
00:12:32,600 --> 00:12:34,820
So you can find out more about timeless,
uh,

206
00:12:34,910 --> 00:12:37,970
on by following it on Facebook
and Twitter and also visiting its

207
00:12:37,971 --> 00:12:39,500
website@timeless.care.

208
00:12:41,890 --> 00:12:43,630
So a bit about me outside of timeless,

209
00:12:43,631 --> 00:12:48,280
I'm also a mentee in the
wool from mentorships program
where I work with mentors

210
00:12:48,281 --> 00:12:52,120
at wool from on machine learning
projects on using the Wolfram language.

211
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:55,960
So on the left is a picture of me that
I took with Dr. Steven Wolf from the

212
00:12:55,961 --> 00:13:00,961
summer and I also represented Wolfrem
and the opportunity project run by the

213
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:02,890
White House.
So in the picture is Megan Smith,

214
00:13:02,891 --> 00:13:06,970
the former CTO and Dj Patil
for the former data scientist.

215
00:13:07,960 --> 00:13:11,830
So some of the projects I've also worked
on in the mentorships program include

216
00:13:11,950 --> 00:13:16,950
using NYC open data to analyze collisions
and traffic data and also using

217
00:13:17,381 --> 00:13:21,350
computer vision to identify
road signs. And also, er,

218
00:13:21,400 --> 00:13:24,850
I'm right now I'm working on creating a
machine learning model for lung cancer

219
00:13:24,851 --> 00:13:26,620
detection in CT scans.

220
00:13:29,490 --> 00:13:33,300
Also at my school I've founded the
coding club and the middle school to

221
00:13:33,301 --> 00:13:36,480
encourage girls to,
to get into stem and to code.

222
00:13:36,780 --> 00:13:40,260
It's my small contribution
to stem advocacy for girls.

223
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:41,900
Okay.

224
00:13:41,900 --> 00:13:44,450
And I'm still a writer.
I write now,

225
00:13:44,451 --> 00:13:47,270
I'm writing for the quiet
revolution is quiet direst blog.

226
00:13:47,660 --> 00:13:50,930
And my next piece is due to
be released on February 28th.

227
00:13:51,910 --> 00:13:52,380
Okay.

228
00:13:52,380 --> 00:13:53,550
Thank you so much for your time.

229
00:13:59,790 --> 00:14:00,340
Okay.

230
00:14:00,340 --> 00:14:03,960
All right. So I think we're supposed
to do some question and answer. Um,

231
00:14:04,100 --> 00:14:06,360
we've got some chairs over
there that I could get. So it,

232
00:14:06,440 --> 00:14:10,760
so it's supposed to be more comfortable.
Oh, they're going to grab them for us.

233
00:14:11,300 --> 00:14:13,660
So the way we do it at Google,
we call it a fireside chat.

234
00:14:13,661 --> 00:14:16,420
So we're supposed to imagine that there's
a fire there and then we're going to

235
00:14:16,430 --> 00:14:20,220
sit down and just have
this like relaxing chat.

236
00:14:20,221 --> 00:14:24,650
So I'm going to ask you like the question
I always ask when somebody does a tech

237
00:14:24,651 --> 00:14:26,120
demo is like,
does it actually work?

238
00:14:31,980 --> 00:14:32,620
Okay.

239
00:14:32,620 --> 00:14:35,350
Yeah. So, uh, as to
whether it works right now,

240
00:14:35,410 --> 00:14:36,940
right now it's like under development.

241
00:14:36,941 --> 00:14:41,290
So a lot of their stuff that you saw in
the video actually is the Ui works, but,

242
00:14:41,291 --> 00:14:44,170
and also the facial recognition is live.
But you know,

243
00:14:44,171 --> 00:14:46,480
part of what I'm raising money for is to,
you know,

244
00:14:46,481 --> 00:14:49,740
continue that development
to its completion. But yeah.

245
00:14:50,150 --> 00:14:52,340
So what would be the next
step in your development?

246
00:14:53,020 --> 00:14:56,790
So right now it's to develop the
backend and then to really, um,

247
00:14:56,860 --> 00:14:59,090
build a team of developers so that I can,
you know,

248
00:14:59,170 --> 00:15:03,370
maintain the APP through it's released
when I at least it over the summer.

249
00:15:03,640 --> 00:15:07,480
And then she kind of solicit feedback
from that because the reason why I reached

250
00:15:07,481 --> 00:15:10,930
out to so many doctors and brain health
centers is to make sure that I can pilot

251
00:15:10,931 --> 00:15:14,740
this with actual patients and their
caregivers and their families.

252
00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:17,410
So once I solicit that feedback,
I'll be able to, you know,

253
00:15:17,411 --> 00:15:20,290
improve on it and add
those phase two features.

254
00:15:20,460 --> 00:15:23,400
Right. So it sounds like it, I mean, you
have a lot of the stuff already finished,

255
00:15:23,401 --> 00:15:27,330
right? If the UI is there. Yeah. Um,
and you've got the facial recognition,

256
00:15:27,331 --> 00:15:28,700
you did that with a partnership,
right?

257
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:31,020
Yeah, I just did that in
partnership was a Kairos,

258
00:15:31,021 --> 00:15:34,080
which is the human elliptic startup
that they do facial recognition.

259
00:15:34,290 --> 00:15:37,050
So I've been doing that in
partnership with them and, um,

260
00:15:37,140 --> 00:15:40,830
they've also been a really great, you
know, technical mentor. Um, you know,

261
00:15:40,831 --> 00:15:43,400
I reached out to them in the beginning
of this project and I was still lucky

262
00:15:43,410 --> 00:15:46,230
that they actually got back to me and
become a long term mentor and with this

263
00:15:46,231 --> 00:15:47,280
project.
Right.

264
00:15:47,400 --> 00:15:50,850
That part is really interesting.
I read that story about you, um,

265
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:53,400
a couple of days ago. Yeah. But
the, the idea of you just, you,

266
00:15:53,460 --> 00:15:56,310
you emailed this company that's
doing facial recognition technology.

267
00:15:56,620 --> 00:15:59,830
Yeah. I emailed the, uh, the CTO of
the company and us. So, you know,

268
00:15:59,831 --> 00:16:02,880
I'm the middle school coder who are
looking to do this project and we're jewel

269
00:16:02,950 --> 00:16:04,690
be willing to, you know,
be my mentor and you know,

270
00:16:04,691 --> 00:16:07,810
support me with the Fisher
recognition and machine learning side.

271
00:16:07,811 --> 00:16:09,430
And they agreed to,
you know,

272
00:16:09,490 --> 00:16:13,780
sponsor the technology
for me and to Gfsi me, uh,

273
00:16:13,990 --> 00:16:15,250
in this development process.

274
00:16:15,350 --> 00:16:17,350
Right. And you've got it
all work, like integrated.

275
00:16:17,351 --> 00:16:19,420
So in your app you like put it up someone,

276
00:16:19,540 --> 00:16:20,910
someone on the camera
and it actually will do.

277
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:21,431
Yeah.

278
00:16:21,431 --> 00:16:26,050
So if you enroll a photo of someone and
then you can take a picture of them and

279
00:16:26,051 --> 00:16:29,110
you'll recognize those people.
Right. That's pretty cool. Yeah.

280
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:32,290
Has your grandma seeing the APP? So
she has seen the APP, but you know,

281
00:16:32,291 --> 00:16:36,730
she's in the literacy of the disease
and also she speaks Chinese. So, um,

282
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:38,770
that's one of the reasons why I want to,
you know,

283
00:16:38,771 --> 00:16:41,820
get the app in multilingual because,
you know,

284
00:16:41,830 --> 00:16:43,990
I don't want language to be
a barrier or a nice thing.

285
00:16:43,991 --> 00:16:47,380
So getting into Spanish and Chinese
in the future, even more languages.

286
00:16:47,460 --> 00:16:49,820
Great. So your earliest testers are
probably not going to be a grandma.

287
00:16:49,821 --> 00:16:50,860
It's going to be people you go.

288
00:16:51,020 --> 00:16:52,700
Yeah.
Hmm.

289
00:16:53,190 --> 00:16:55,850
All right. So what, what kind of
developers do you want to work with?

290
00:16:55,851 --> 00:16:58,270
I guess you'd be like the lead
developer and you're sort of a,

291
00:16:58,680 --> 00:17:01,350
yeah, I really hope that
even if I expand the team,

292
00:17:01,351 --> 00:17:03,990
I really want to be working in
the development because you know,

293
00:17:03,991 --> 00:17:07,200
I still love to code and that's really
one of my greatest, greatest passions.

294
00:17:07,201 --> 00:17:10,710
So I really, I'm looking at like, you
know, to collaborate with other people.

295
00:17:10,711 --> 00:17:14,040
And make sure that this
gets into my goals. Hmm.

296
00:17:14,660 --> 00:17:15,650
So would you say,

297
00:17:15,651 --> 00:17:18,980
I mean there's a lot of programmers
and I think Google where we're sort of

298
00:17:18,981 --> 00:17:20,210
filled with programmers who are like,

299
00:17:20,211 --> 00:17:22,430
we grew up and we were
very much introverts.

300
00:17:22,431 --> 00:17:26,120
We sat around in front of our computers
because we didn't necessarily like

301
00:17:26,121 --> 00:17:29,150
people as much as we liked the computers.
But it seems like you're,

302
00:17:29,151 --> 00:17:31,730
you're really across the board,
right? You're doing the business,

303
00:17:31,731 --> 00:17:35,480
you're doing the UI design, you're
doing the, um, development, like what's,

304
00:17:35,481 --> 00:17:37,730
what's your preference? What do you
like the best? Or is it everything?

305
00:17:38,010 --> 00:17:39,670
Um, yeah, I really like everything.

306
00:17:39,671 --> 00:17:43,510
Not just because like I like computer
science more or anything because I really,

307
00:17:43,630 --> 00:17:48,370
my passion is really to use technology
and apply it to problems that I see in my

308
00:17:48,371 --> 00:17:52,230
community. So it's not just, you know,
coding the APP, but it's also, you know,

309
00:17:52,231 --> 00:17:53,850
reaching out to people and seeing,
you know,

310
00:17:53,851 --> 00:17:57,420
what kind of things that they want to
see in such an app and know all around.

311
00:17:57,421 --> 00:17:59,060
That's like really what
I really like enjoy.

312
00:17:59,330 --> 00:18:02,410
Oh, what's, what's it like being
a 14 year old entrepreneur?

313
00:18:03,220 --> 00:18:04,780
Um, I think definitely, you know,

314
00:18:04,781 --> 00:18:09,220
age sometimes is a barrier because it's
hard for you to like go out and ask for

315
00:18:09,221 --> 00:18:12,700
people's help and people just take your
seriously with your project if you're 14.

316
00:18:12,940 --> 00:18:13,331
But you know,

317
00:18:13,331 --> 00:18:16,840
I've been really lucky to meet people
on the way along the way who have been

318
00:18:16,841 --> 00:18:21,130
really supportive of the APP and really
believed in my ability to get this to

319
00:18:21,131 --> 00:18:21,964
completion.

320
00:18:22,460 --> 00:18:26,590
It seems like Bill Gates takes
you seriously. Yeah. All right.

321
00:18:26,650 --> 00:18:31,290
Is there any audience questions we
can take some of those or hold, oh,

322
00:18:31,400 --> 00:18:36,290
we need to get a microphone.
Oh, recording catch sparks.

323
00:18:37,650 --> 00:18:41,720
Who was it called? The other
question. Some microphone.

324
00:18:42,470 --> 00:18:45,620
Go ahead, Hannah. Is it on? Yeah.

325
00:18:46,250 --> 00:18:47,780
Um,
so first question,

326
00:18:47,781 --> 00:18:50,900
I think one thanks for so much for coming
and sharing your story and your work

327
00:18:50,901 --> 00:18:51,820
with us.
Um,

328
00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:56,060
I think the thing that was really cool
about the APP and as a non super or not

329
00:18:56,061 --> 00:18:58,710
technical person or less technical,
um,

330
00:18:58,820 --> 00:19:02,700
really interesting how you
said like ultimately the,

331
00:19:02,701 --> 00:19:04,820
the APP could be used for
research and data collection.

332
00:19:04,850 --> 00:19:07,730
I'm curious about sort of what you said
on the front end though, that sort of,

333
00:19:08,120 --> 00:19:12,020
there's some research or nascent research
showing that when you actually engage

334
00:19:12,320 --> 00:19:16,280
with an Alzheimer's or dementia patient
in like a way other than just telling

335
00:19:16,281 --> 00:19:19,520
them who it is or what data does that
that can actually help stave off or

336
00:19:19,521 --> 00:19:20,480
improve their condition.

337
00:19:20,481 --> 00:19:23,900
Could you talk a little more about that
and sort of the future for how you're

338
00:19:23,960 --> 00:19:26,870
gonna build that into the APP or some
of the research you've seen with your

339
00:19:26,871 --> 00:19:27,630
partners?

340
00:19:27,630 --> 00:19:31,200
Yeah, definitely. Uh, so you know, the
part of the thing is that, you know,

341
00:19:31,201 --> 00:19:35,270
repetition is like really
key for Alzheimer's patients.
So part of, you know, the,

342
00:19:35,280 --> 00:19:37,230
the concept of,
you know,

343
00:19:37,231 --> 00:19:41,220
seeing the updates and seeing the photos
again and again is really to refresh

344
00:19:41,221 --> 00:19:44,850
their memory and let them see the same
people but in different contexts so that

345
00:19:44,851 --> 00:19:47,130
they can kind of refresh
their memory on those people.

346
00:19:47,131 --> 00:19:49,860
But not always just do the same
information over and over again.

347
00:19:50,250 --> 00:19:53,310
It's you that's really like the
concept applies to every field.

348
00:19:53,311 --> 00:19:56,740
Not only just engaging with friends and
family, but also seeing photos. Okay.

349
00:19:57,450 --> 00:19:59,340
I have one more question
that's not app related,

350
00:19:59,341 --> 00:20:04,341
but you've done so much in your 14
years from music to writing to attack.

351
00:20:04,831 --> 00:20:09,290
I think, uh, I know this is being recorded
for Googlers and youtube audience, um,

352
00:20:09,570 --> 00:20:10,770
you know more broadly,

353
00:20:10,771 --> 00:20:13,680
but would love to hear some words of
wisdom from sort of how you've been able

354
00:20:13,681 --> 00:20:17,160
like your own thoughts on your keys to
success or how you are able to do all

355
00:20:17,161 --> 00:20:19,690
these really great, very
things and still, you know,

356
00:20:19,691 --> 00:20:23,070
maintain your interest in writing and
sort of not be sort of singularly focused

357
00:20:23,071 --> 00:20:27,900
but sort of life and task and focus
management advice would be appreciated.

358
00:20:28,080 --> 00:20:31,320
Yeah, I mean like as I've know juggled
all of these different interests.

359
00:20:31,321 --> 00:20:35,520
It's really actually how does the eye
I can intersect those because you know,

360
00:20:35,521 --> 00:20:37,770
a law of what I do now is I write about,
you know,

361
00:20:37,771 --> 00:20:42,160
my interest in coding or my interest
in helping other people with, um,

362
00:20:42,200 --> 00:20:45,720
stemmed advocacy and getting girls
into stem. So I think that, you know,

363
00:20:45,721 --> 00:20:49,440
one way to really get yourself in like so
many different fields as you know, how,

364
00:20:49,450 --> 00:20:52,390
find some way to intersect
those two fields,

365
00:20:52,420 --> 00:20:56,740
like writing about tech or you know,
doing music, writing about music.

366
00:20:56,741 --> 00:20:57,640
I think that's like,
you know,

367
00:20:57,641 --> 00:21:01,000
how I've been able to kind of grasp
a hold of all those different, uh,

368
00:21:01,150 --> 00:21:04,300
interests at the same time.
Awesome. Thank you. Thank you.

369
00:21:05,070 --> 00:21:08,010
Terrific question over
there. Yeah. Um, so yeah,

370
00:21:08,011 --> 00:21:12,120
my question is around just what were some
of your biggest challenges and how did

371
00:21:12,121 --> 00:21:13,050
you overcome them?

372
00:21:13,450 --> 00:21:14,840
Yeah, so I think that, you know,

373
00:21:14,870 --> 00:21:18,620
cause timeless is the first APP that
I've really seen from start to finish

374
00:21:19,460 --> 00:21:23,840
developing it, getting the ideas and
then seeing it, you know, complete, uh,

375
00:21:23,841 --> 00:21:27,810
I'm hoping this this year. And so, uh,
one of the biggest challenges, you know,

376
00:21:27,870 --> 00:21:31,730
have been, you know, what is exactly the
process for this and a lot of it stuck.

377
00:21:32,150 --> 00:21:33,020
I've been,

378
00:21:33,080 --> 00:21:36,230
I've been learning to how to be really
eager about reaching out to my mentors

379
00:21:36,231 --> 00:21:39,830
about. Absolutely. I think,
because you know, they are
the ones with the experience.

380
00:21:39,831 --> 00:21:41,270
So I think that,
you know,

381
00:21:41,271 --> 00:21:43,970
reaching out to those people and asking
all the questions that you have is

382
00:21:43,971 --> 00:21:46,970
really important because you know,
someone out there has the answer.

383
00:21:48,050 --> 00:21:49,100
Okay.

384
00:21:50,110 --> 00:21:52,390
So your current study coating
when you were six. Yeah.

385
00:21:52,610 --> 00:21:56,140
So on your resume does not mean you can
say you have eight years of programming

386
00:21:56,141 --> 00:21:56,974
experience.

387
00:21:57,180 --> 00:21:58,590
I guess.
I mean I,

388
00:21:58,650 --> 00:22:02,820
when I first started I kind of started
with scratch and then I wasn't as into it

389
00:22:02,850 --> 00:22:07,020
as when I actually picked it up back again
when I was around 10 and I, you know,

390
00:22:07,021 --> 00:22:10,830
I actually got into and the social
entrepreneurship field and saw, you know,

391
00:22:10,831 --> 00:22:14,240
really the impact that technology has
on people because before you know it

392
00:22:14,310 --> 00:22:18,000
sideways like a game or like a tool
that I could just kind of create.

393
00:22:18,600 --> 00:22:19,320
But you know,

394
00:22:19,320 --> 00:22:23,850
I really saw the impact and the benefit
it can have on not only people that I

395
00:22:23,851 --> 00:22:25,860
know,
people that are around the world.

396
00:22:25,861 --> 00:22:28,800
So that's kind of how I
picked it up later on.

397
00:22:29,050 --> 00:22:31,270
So you got it.
You started off with the,

398
00:22:31,271 --> 00:22:33,620
the interest in actually
solving problems and you,

399
00:22:33,621 --> 00:22:36,320
you taught yourself coding so
that you can solve the problems.

400
00:22:36,420 --> 00:22:39,780
Yeah. So it was kind of like, you
know, how do I do the certain task?

401
00:22:39,781 --> 00:22:42,630
Like how do I make the cat move
from here to here on scratch?

402
00:22:42,660 --> 00:22:45,480
And I kinda like went from
there and just exploring.

403
00:22:45,481 --> 00:22:48,870
And then it was when I was around 10
that actually found that drive to create

404
00:22:48,871 --> 00:22:49,680
something.

405
00:22:49,680 --> 00:22:51,930
I see.
Did you go straight from scratch to swift?

406
00:22:52,280 --> 00:22:56,780
Uh, I actually went through
things like html, CSS, MIT,

407
00:22:56,781 --> 00:22:58,850
app inventor,
and then I,

408
00:22:58,880 --> 00:23:02,960
when I was around I think 10 or 11 I
went to his class at the flood are in

409
00:23:02,961 --> 00:23:06,560
school for high school students to learn
how to do ios programming. And you know,

410
00:23:06,561 --> 00:23:09,710
that's where I kind of, and the class
actually had a really big focus on,

411
00:23:09,711 --> 00:23:12,680
you know, how can you use your
apps to help other people?

412
00:23:12,980 --> 00:23:14,720
And I think that's really,
really inspired me.

413
00:23:14,721 --> 00:23:18,590
Not only just technovation but seeing
going to that course and seeing, you know,

414
00:23:18,740 --> 00:23:20,990
I can actually have an
impact using technology.

415
00:23:21,630 --> 00:23:25,170
Wow. So what's, uh,
what's next? Is it, is it,

416
00:23:25,240 --> 00:23:27,090
are you sticking primarily
with this one app?

417
00:23:27,091 --> 00:23:29,610
Do you want to get it done or do you
have other ideas you're working on?

418
00:23:29,900 --> 00:23:32,840
Yeah, I think my primary focus is this
app because I really want to see it,

419
00:23:32,841 --> 00:23:35,720
you know, get out into the
world and see, um, you know,

420
00:23:35,840 --> 00:23:37,940
patients who are going to
be benefiting from this.

421
00:23:37,941 --> 00:23:41,360
But I'm definitely really interested
in the machine learning field and data

422
00:23:41,361 --> 00:23:42,194
science.

423
00:23:42,230 --> 00:23:46,370
It's one of the reasons why I'm working
on my lung cancer project for lung

424
00:23:46,371 --> 00:23:50,300
cancer and CT scans with machine learning
because I really want to explore,

425
00:23:50,301 --> 00:23:50,720
you know,

426
00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:55,010
the intersection between technology and
health care and how machine learning is

427
00:23:55,011 --> 00:23:58,460
really helping us in those fields.
Interesting. Any more questions?

428
00:23:59,590 --> 00:24:04,360
Yes. Um, so I'm wondering is it working?

429
00:24:04,390 --> 00:24:05,223
Yeah.
Okay.

430
00:24:05,980 --> 00:24:10,980
I'm wondering that how difficult it's
going to be to engage a new user into

431
00:24:13,181 --> 00:24:15,430
using a timeless,

432
00:24:15,790 --> 00:24:18,460
like somebody with alzheimers,

433
00:24:18,490 --> 00:24:22,600
wouldn't they be likely to forget to
even use the APP in the first place?

434
00:24:22,601 --> 00:24:27,601
How long would it take and what do you
plan on doing to keep them coming back?

435
00:24:29,560 --> 00:24:34,560
And continuing to use the
APP for their benefit?

436
00:24:35,140 --> 00:24:36,220
Yeah,
that's a great question.

437
00:24:36,250 --> 00:24:39,530
I think that this is one of the reasons
why I made sure that the caregiver

438
00:24:39,550 --> 00:24:41,950
played a really big role in
the app because you know,

439
00:24:41,951 --> 00:24:45,370
everything is really between caregiver
and patient and a family and friend

440
00:24:45,371 --> 00:24:49,630
relationships to make sure that those
are really hands on really close. And so,

441
00:24:49,631 --> 00:24:52,240
you know, part of it is that,
you know, caregivers have, uh,

442
00:24:52,280 --> 00:24:56,160
an administrator kind of role to make
sure the the patient has keep on,

443
00:24:56,260 --> 00:24:57,340
keeps on using the APP,

444
00:24:57,341 --> 00:25:01,000
keeps on engaging that family and friends
keep on engaging with the APP because

445
00:25:01,001 --> 00:25:03,280
really it's, um, you
know, people, you know,

446
00:25:03,310 --> 00:25:06,640
seeing more content coming in that really
engages people to keep on using it.

447
00:25:07,140 --> 00:25:10,770
Okay. And for somebody,
for a family member,

448
00:25:11,010 --> 00:25:16,010
would they have to install the full app
and log into the patient's account if

449
00:25:16,981 --> 00:25:19,800
they wanted to share or
is that done separately?

450
00:25:20,180 --> 00:25:22,170
So, uh, they would have
to download the APP,

451
00:25:22,171 --> 00:25:25,470
but there are three sides that I will
integrate it into the same app so they can

452
00:25:25,471 --> 00:25:27,570
register as a family and friend or,

453
00:25:27,571 --> 00:25:30,360
and be invited by the caregiver
into the patient's, you know,

454
00:25:30,361 --> 00:25:35,070
circle of friends and then they would
be able to share their photos through

455
00:25:35,250 --> 00:25:39,000
their photos app in order to, you
know, let the patient see those photos.

456
00:25:39,120 --> 00:25:41,810
Interesting. Thank you. Thank you. Okay.

457
00:25:43,970 --> 00:25:44,803
Anybody else?

458
00:25:45,470 --> 00:25:50,420
There's one, um, your body of work is
extremely impressive, so Kudos to you.

459
00:25:51,120 --> 00:25:56,120
I was curious to know whether or not
your school is supportive and helping you

460
00:25:57,230 --> 00:26:00,650
work on your app.
Like whether or not they've had any input,

461
00:26:00,651 --> 00:26:04,820
whether or not they've helped you to
reach out to people and what education

462
00:26:04,821 --> 00:26:07,130
goals are you looking at in the future?
Have you started,

463
00:26:07,220 --> 00:26:10,340
you're not in high school yet, are
you? I just started high school. Okay.

464
00:26:10,400 --> 00:26:13,760
Are you looking at any
particular colleges already?

465
00:26:14,200 --> 00:26:16,550
A lot. Yeah. I'm haven't
really looked at colleges yet,

466
00:26:16,610 --> 00:26:21,110
but it's definitely like I really want
to go into a computer science and uh,

467
00:26:21,111 --> 00:26:24,560
you know, definitely looking at healthcare
and computer science and that's,

468
00:26:24,630 --> 00:26:26,930
that's the field I really want
to go into in the future as well.

469
00:26:27,560 --> 00:26:30,430
But in terms of my school, you know,
my school has been really supportive.

470
00:26:30,440 --> 00:26:33,980
All of my endeavors in technology
especially, you know, with uh,

471
00:26:34,070 --> 00:26:37,940
reaching out to people about
scholarships and contests, you know,

472
00:26:38,150 --> 00:26:42,080
they have been really supportive of that
and pushing me to kind of go and push

473
00:26:42,081 --> 00:26:45,490
my boundaries and see where
I can explore. Um, my school,

474
00:26:45,550 --> 00:26:49,590
this is outside of school project, but my
school does teach, you know, basic, uh,

475
00:26:49,620 --> 00:26:53,190
computer science. In seventh grade we
did some of that called processing.

476
00:26:53,191 --> 00:26:57,320
It's like a very basic version of Java
that we use to learn computer sciences

477
00:26:57,360 --> 00:27:00,200
integrating to our math class as well.
So the unit,

478
00:27:00,420 --> 00:27:03,150
there's definitely a framework
for computer science at my school.

479
00:27:03,650 --> 00:27:04,483
Okay.

480
00:27:06,100 --> 00:27:08,650
Yeah, I have a question. Well,
thank you so much for coming.

481
00:27:08,720 --> 00:27:10,930
I just want to say personally,

482
00:27:10,931 --> 00:27:14,470
I've been so touched by
everything that you're doing.

483
00:27:14,471 --> 00:27:17,020
I hadn't experienced of
Alzheimer's in my family.

484
00:27:17,021 --> 00:27:18,760
And it's such a terrible disease.

485
00:27:18,761 --> 00:27:22,000
So you're really bettering humankind
and that's something you should take to

486
00:27:22,001 --> 00:27:24,090
heart. It's amazing. Um,

487
00:27:24,400 --> 00:27:29,080
so my question for you is as we know
it's a progressing disease and it's

488
00:27:29,140 --> 00:27:33,640
something that can start out a little
bit light and then get really terrible.

489
00:27:33,641 --> 00:27:37,750
So in phase two are you thinking about
different ways to tailor the APP to the

490
00:27:37,751 --> 00:27:40,000
different phases of the disease?

491
00:27:40,110 --> 00:27:42,360
Yeah, it's definitely something that
I've been thankful about. You know,

492
00:27:42,361 --> 00:27:46,110
how do I kind of personalize it to a
patient cause the disease affects everyone

493
00:27:46,111 --> 00:27:46,944
differently.

494
00:27:46,950 --> 00:27:49,680
And this is one of the reasons why I've
been networking with so many doctors

495
00:27:49,681 --> 00:27:53,790
because there are so many ways in
different kinds of approaches that you can

496
00:27:53,820 --> 00:27:55,890
take when making such an APP.
And you know,

497
00:27:55,891 --> 00:27:59,300
things like integrating those mental
exercises into the APP or using

498
00:27:59,310 --> 00:28:02,820
gamification is really trying
to make sure that, you know,

499
00:28:02,850 --> 00:28:07,740
every aspect of the patient's life is
encompassed by the APP and any stage of

500
00:28:07,741 --> 00:28:08,574
the disease.

501
00:28:09,870 --> 00:28:10,550
Thank you.

502
00:28:10,550 --> 00:28:14,360
Thank you. So you're working really
closely with caregivers like the house.

503
00:28:14,390 --> 00:28:17,810
How much more work do you think needs
to go into the APP before you can do a

504
00:28:17,811 --> 00:28:20,630
little bit of trial with them and actually
start getting the feedback directly?

505
00:28:21,140 --> 00:28:21,441
Yeah,

506
00:28:21,441 --> 00:28:24,920
I think it's mainly just finishing up
the development and the coding of the APP

507
00:28:24,950 --> 00:28:28,530
for, I can actually release it because
you know, a lot of the framework is there.

508
00:28:28,531 --> 00:28:33,500
A lot of the people that I know are there
to kind of get ready for the pilot was

509
00:28:33,501 --> 00:28:34,241
actual patients.

510
00:28:34,241 --> 00:28:38,450
So I think that it's really just finishing
coding it up and then releasing it

511
00:28:38,480 --> 00:28:40,610
that I can start actually
soliciting feedback.

512
00:28:40,820 --> 00:28:43,820
Is it in the APP store already or
it's not right now because I'm still

513
00:28:43,821 --> 00:28:46,290
developing it, but it's going
to be there like mid year. Yeah.

514
00:28:46,330 --> 00:28:50,270
So do you think that if you had enough
time you'd be able to do all the

515
00:28:50,271 --> 00:28:53,030
necessary work to get the app finished
or are there things that you're missing

516
00:28:53,031 --> 00:28:56,630
right now that you need help with? Um, I
think it's definitely just an issue of,

517
00:28:56,631 --> 00:28:59,390
you know, time, because I'm
a full time student, so I,

518
00:28:59,570 --> 00:29:01,080
that's one of the reasons
why I really want to.

519
00:29:01,081 --> 00:29:05,720
And you build a team of developers so
I can code evolve this bus because it's

520
00:29:05,721 --> 00:29:06,920
really a matter of,
you know,

521
00:29:06,950 --> 00:29:10,730
getting people on this and developing it
together that will really speed up the

522
00:29:10,731 --> 00:29:14,510
process. That makes sense.
So what is your, do you have,

523
00:29:14,540 --> 00:29:17,600
do you have other friends that are
into this entrepreneurship or coding or

524
00:29:17,601 --> 00:29:20,540
anything like that? Or is it kind
of lonely at the top right now?

525
00:29:20,840 --> 00:29:23,050
I definitely do have friends
who are like into, you know,

526
00:29:23,060 --> 00:29:26,390
the social justice and social
entrepreneurship. I'm actually at school,

527
00:29:26,391 --> 00:29:29,970
I have a group of high
school friends who are, uh,

528
00:29:30,020 --> 00:29:33,110
we're all working on this project
called food for thought. And it's a,

529
00:29:33,111 --> 00:29:37,220
we're trying to build a platform for
people who get free or reduced price lunch

530
00:29:37,221 --> 00:29:42,221
to kind of get Janae like kind of like
a go fund me school lunch to make sure

531
00:29:42,791 --> 00:29:46,210
that they don't go into lunch debt.
Hmm. So we're working on that as well.

532
00:29:46,211 --> 00:29:46,421
And you know,

533
00:29:46,421 --> 00:29:49,660
that's also goes into living the
technological entrepreneurship and social

534
00:29:49,661 --> 00:29:50,750
entrepreneurship field.

535
00:29:50,751 --> 00:29:54,370
So I think that definitely getting more
people interested in exposing people at

536
00:29:54,371 --> 00:29:56,530
my school to this kind of
work is really important.

537
00:29:58,250 --> 00:29:59,083
Anybody else?

538
00:30:01,760 --> 00:30:03,470
It's a cumbersome microphone.
Um,

539
00:30:04,350 --> 00:30:07,500
you mentioned your current fundraising
model and how you were hoping to maybe

540
00:30:07,501 --> 00:30:11,790
hire engineering resources first,
but as you look to Beta test the APP,

541
00:30:11,791 --> 00:30:16,250
I was wondering if you were thinking
about partnering with scaled, um,

542
00:30:16,920 --> 00:30:20,790
caregiver sources like
home instead or you know,

543
00:30:21,480 --> 00:30:25,890
maybe multi touch points for people who
are working closely with Alzheimer's

544
00:30:25,891 --> 00:30:26,724
patients at home?

545
00:30:26,960 --> 00:30:29,480
Yeah, that's definitely something I've
been definitely working on. You know,

546
00:30:29,720 --> 00:30:30,531
reaching out to people,

547
00:30:30,531 --> 00:30:33,920
like the Alzheimer's Association has a
whole network of caregivers, you know,

548
00:30:34,190 --> 00:30:37,370
trying to find those resources
to really get the word out there.

549
00:30:39,270 --> 00:30:39,560
Okay,

550
00:30:39,560 --> 00:30:43,100
so what can, what can we do to make
you more successful? What do you need?

551
00:30:43,280 --> 00:30:45,190
I think definitely just
spreading awareness is, you know,

552
00:30:45,200 --> 00:30:47,900
the biggest thing right
now because you know, the,

553
00:30:47,901 --> 00:30:51,470
the APP is really dependent on people
knowing about this and people really

554
00:30:51,471 --> 00:30:52,490
engaging with the APP.

555
00:30:52,491 --> 00:30:56,150
So I think spreading awareness and making
sure that people who have Alzheimer's

556
00:30:56,170 --> 00:30:58,730
are affected by Alzheimer's. You
know, know about this and you know,

557
00:30:58,731 --> 00:31:00,870
get involved when this comes
out. All right. And the,

558
00:31:00,890 --> 00:31:03,710
the Indiegogo page is under timeless.
Yes.

559
00:31:03,711 --> 00:31:06,140
And I did a Google search for Indiegogo,
timeless earlier,

560
00:31:06,141 --> 00:31:08,690
and there were two hits. There's
timeless, the movie and timeless,

561
00:31:08,691 --> 00:31:12,680
the healthcare APP. You want the
second one? Um, all right. Well,

562
00:31:12,681 --> 00:31:17,390
I think that that is a good place to stop.
All right.

563
00:31:17,391 --> 00:31:19,490
So thank you again for coming.
Thank you so much.
