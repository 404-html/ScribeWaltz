1
00:00:05,690 --> 00:00:06,321
Good afternoon.

2
00:00:06,321 --> 00:00:11,180
It's great to be back and it's great
to be back with my very good friend Dan

3
00:00:11,180 --> 00:00:14,180
Doctoroff, uh, who as you
know, has written a book,

4
00:00:14,181 --> 00:00:15,830
which I think is actually fantastic.

5
00:00:15,831 --> 00:00:20,450
If you want to understand how the city
around you, it was built, read this book.

6
00:00:20,451 --> 00:00:22,880
If you want to understand how hard it is,
read this book.

7
00:00:23,900 --> 00:00:28,130
If you want to understand what it takes
to transform a city during your adult

8
00:00:28,131 --> 00:00:32,810
lifetimes here, read this book, uh,
and we'll have copies at the end, uh,

9
00:00:32,900 --> 00:00:35,120
in the back of Danville side,
a few and so forth.

10
00:00:35,420 --> 00:00:39,260
I'll ask a few questions and
as usual, then we'll have
your questions as well. Uh,

11
00:00:39,290 --> 00:00:42,860
before we actually talk about the book,
what are you doing in Toronto?

12
00:00:43,480 --> 00:00:47,140
Because everybody heard anything
about what sidewalk labs is doing,

13
00:00:47,141 --> 00:00:51,410
so you know that, so I was
deputy mayor for uh, uh,

14
00:00:51,580 --> 00:00:55,850
six years and then I ran Bloomberg Lp.
Um,

15
00:00:55,930 --> 00:00:59,530
and then when Mike Bloomberg decided that,
you know,

16
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:02,000
he wanted to get back involved
in the business side, I said,

17
00:01:02,010 --> 00:01:03,640
I want to go do something on my own.

18
00:01:03,641 --> 00:01:07,540
And so we teamed up together a Google now,

19
00:01:07,570 --> 00:01:09,310
alphabet and me,

20
00:01:09,640 --> 00:01:14,640
and we created sidewalk labs and sidewalk
labs is a bat just like Waymo and

21
00:01:14,951 --> 00:01:15,784
others.

22
00:01:15,970 --> 00:01:20,970
And our mission is fundamentally
to improve life in cities.

23
00:01:22,150 --> 00:01:26,770
Um, and we're going about it
in a, I think incredible way.

24
00:01:26,771 --> 00:01:31,280
I am so excited about this.
Um, we want to build, um,

25
00:01:31,750 --> 00:01:34,300
a city are really a district of a city.

26
00:01:34,600 --> 00:01:39,160
And so just a few weeks ago we announced
that we're partnering with Toronto.

27
00:01:39,700 --> 00:01:43,870
Uh, I've not learned how to say Toronto
actually for those of you who are right,

28
00:01:44,020 --> 00:01:48,700
there's no big t on the end.
Toronto. It's like Toronto.

29
00:01:48,730 --> 00:01:52,300
Toronto. Yeah. And uh, um,

30
00:01:52,330 --> 00:01:55,990
it is an amazing city for those of
you who haven't ever been there.

31
00:01:55,991 --> 00:02:00,430
It's really close to here, like an
hour and 15 minutes away. But, um, we,

32
00:02:00,490 --> 00:02:02,980
when we say we want to
build a district or a city,

33
00:02:02,981 --> 00:02:07,981
we want to be able to show
how bringing together um,

34
00:02:08,200 --> 00:02:13,200
great urban design and cutting edge
technology on an integrated basis across

35
00:02:15,671 --> 00:02:17,430
kind of every urban system.

36
00:02:17,431 --> 00:02:20,800
So how we get around sustainability,

37
00:02:21,010 --> 00:02:23,980
the nature of buildings,
public space,

38
00:02:24,100 --> 00:02:28,330
community and social
services driven by data.

39
00:02:28,390 --> 00:02:33,390
How we can fundamentally bend the curve
on every aspect of quality of life.

40
00:02:35,410 --> 00:02:39,310
Can we actually, and we believe
we can based on two years of work,

41
00:02:39,311 --> 00:02:42,550
which Eric has helped to guide us on.
Um,

42
00:02:42,670 --> 00:02:47,020
can we dramatically reduce the cost
of living in a city? We believe that.

43
00:02:47,350 --> 00:02:52,350
Can we actually create the only
climate positive place on earth?

44
00:02:53,530 --> 00:02:54,790
We think it can be done.

45
00:02:55,150 --> 00:02:59,740
Can we actually achieve vision zero
where there are no accidents on streets?

46
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:01,270
We think it can be done.

47
00:03:01,390 --> 00:03:05,410
Can we give time-starved parents
an hour or more back in their day?

48
00:03:05,530 --> 00:03:10,240
We think all of that can be done. This
isn't easy. This is big. It's long,

49
00:03:10,241 --> 00:03:14,600
it's complex. Uh, but that's
what we're all about. And uh,

50
00:03:14,680 --> 00:03:17,760
we're really excited about it. The, uh,

51
00:03:17,810 --> 00:03:22,090
everybody at Google and alphabet
has been so supportive. Uh,

52
00:03:22,250 --> 00:03:26,960
but we have a chance, I think to really
make history. And so I'm happy to talk

53
00:03:27,010 --> 00:03:31,280
more about it and questions. We support
what you're doing incredibly. Yeah,

54
00:03:31,320 --> 00:03:34,960
it's been rough. The whole team
has boundaries talking about it.

55
00:03:34,961 --> 00:03:37,190
So let's talk about New York.
Um,

56
00:03:37,240 --> 00:03:42,100
your book largely begins with your
inauguration of Mike Bloomberg, the mayor,

57
00:03:42,101 --> 00:03:45,140
and you sort of running
everything with him. Um,

58
00:03:45,340 --> 00:03:49,750
and one of the first things you did is
you did an assessment of the city from

59
00:03:49,751 --> 00:03:52,910
the standpoint of being
kind of in charge of it. Um,

60
00:03:53,080 --> 00:03:56,950
and you had a number of very interesting
observations, housing shortage.

61
00:03:57,280 --> 00:04:02,140
We're dealmaking take us through,
take us back to 2002,

62
00:04:02,500 --> 00:04:06,130
right? Nine 11 is just happened. The
city is recovering from the horror,

63
00:04:06,160 --> 00:04:09,670
horrific tragedy. Has It feel,
what'd you learn? What'd you see?

64
00:04:10,030 --> 00:04:12,530
It was kind of terrifying. I'm on the, the

65
00:04:12,530 --> 00:04:14,360
one hand,
on the other hand,

66
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:19,720
the title of my book greater than ever
comes from sort of the declaration that

67
00:04:19,971 --> 00:04:24,971
then mayor Rudy Giuliani made
literally on nine 11 that New Yorkers,

68
00:04:25,640 --> 00:04:30,560
we're not going to be intimidated
by the terrorist attack,

69
00:04:30,590 --> 00:04:35,390
the tragedy, and instead we're going
to make the city greater than ever.

70
00:04:36,020 --> 00:04:41,020
And that as a rallying cry actually
I think enabled a lot of what we were

71
00:04:42,111 --> 00:04:43,490
subsequently able to do.

72
00:04:43,491 --> 00:04:48,491
So on the one hand you came in and the
city was basically destroyed financially

73
00:04:48,651 --> 00:04:53,600
it was a rack, um, physically
because of nine 11 you say that?

74
00:04:53,630 --> 00:04:55,580
Oh yeah, totally. Nine, 11,

75
00:04:55,850 --> 00:05:00,850
the number of jobs and people who fled
the city in the immediate aftermath of

76
00:05:02,751 --> 00:05:07,010
nine 11 was really kind of frightening.
You know,

77
00:05:07,011 --> 00:05:11,210
we lost that tens of thousands of
tourism jobs, literally overnight.

78
00:05:11,510 --> 00:05:15,050
The financial services sector,
which was concentrated downtown,

79
00:05:15,230 --> 00:05:19,850
many of the firms to camp almost
immediately to New Jersey. Um,

80
00:05:20,150 --> 00:05:22,640
there were, there's a great
kind of article, I mean,

81
00:05:22,970 --> 00:05:27,230
terrible article in a way in the New York
Times questioning whether New York and

82
00:05:27,231 --> 00:05:32,210
its existing model of openness sort
of would actually be able to survive.

83
00:05:32,211 --> 00:05:35,090
So that was the conditions
that we came into.

84
00:05:35,270 --> 00:05:37,880
So you had a whole area of
the city that was destroyed.

85
00:05:37,881 --> 00:05:42,230
Most of the rest of the world thought more
of New York was destroyed financially.

86
00:05:42,260 --> 00:05:44,240
The budget was a disaster.

87
00:05:44,241 --> 00:05:49,010
We were facing a $5 billion
budget deficits in our first year.

88
00:05:49,130 --> 00:05:53,960
Literally that opened up overnight. Um,
and emotionally the city was on edge.

89
00:05:54,470 --> 00:05:58,500
So the question is, what do you do
about it? And a, it's, Eric said the,

90
00:05:58,610 --> 00:06:02,270
one of the first things that we did is
we stepped back and said, you know what,

91
00:06:02,630 --> 00:06:07,630
let's think of New York with
a completely clean slate.

92
00:06:09,260 --> 00:06:13,490
I mean in the sense that let's
look at it in an unvarnished way.

93
00:06:13,700 --> 00:06:17,600
What are our strengths? What are
weaknesses, the way you would a business.

94
00:06:18,050 --> 00:06:22,040
And so we literally brought in
consulting firms, they did a ton of work.

95
00:06:22,041 --> 00:06:25,790
We looked at different businesses and
whether they ought to be in New York or

96
00:06:25,791 --> 00:06:30,650
not. And um, and out of
that evolved a strategy,

97
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:31,580
um,

98
00:06:31,580 --> 00:06:36,580
that we pursued pretty
relentlessly for the next 12 years.

99
00:06:36,740 --> 00:06:41,600
And you know, I like to think that,
you know, while wasn't perfect, um,

100
00:06:41,601 --> 00:06:43,400
overall we really got
the band was interesting.

101
00:06:43,401 --> 00:06:45,140
One of the things that
you first discovered,

102
00:06:45,141 --> 00:06:48,080
which you shouldn't be paying
off businesses by in the city.

103
00:06:48,350 --> 00:06:50,480
And this is a time when
everyone's leaving, right?

104
00:06:50,630 --> 00:06:52,310
So everyone's coming
to the city and saying,

105
00:06:52,311 --> 00:06:55,250
I want $1 billion tax
abatement or what have you.

106
00:06:55,251 --> 00:06:58,820
And in the book you actually tell the
stories of what actually happened and he's

107
00:06:58,821 --> 00:07:03,821
very difficult discussions with people
who had been promised large windfalls.

108
00:07:03,860 --> 00:07:08,190
Right. And you canceled them. We did.
And this was almost right away. Um,

109
00:07:08,270 --> 00:07:13,040
we just believe based on that analysis
that people were either going to stay

110
00:07:13,041 --> 00:07:18,041
here or not based on what
ever they needed in the,

111
00:07:19,190 --> 00:07:21,410
ultimately the economics of being here.

112
00:07:21,620 --> 00:07:26,620
So companies that really had sort
of a significant amount of kind of

113
00:07:26,870 --> 00:07:29,750
intellectual capital that
we're powering the business,

114
00:07:29,930 --> 00:07:33,080
they were going to stay because
they could find better people here.

115
00:07:33,350 --> 00:07:38,350
We really believe that that companies
that were extremely cost conscious at the

116
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:40,341
end of the day over time,

117
00:07:40,341 --> 00:07:44,600
and whether it was a division or a unit
of a company that was really dependent

118
00:07:44,601 --> 00:07:48,680
upon sort of very tight margins,
we couldn't keep them here by,

119
00:07:48,950 --> 00:07:52,250
we had almost no manufacturing
jobs left in the city.

120
00:07:52,610 --> 00:07:55,580
And so we developed a strategy and this
one of the stories that you're referring

121
00:07:55,581 --> 00:07:59,630
to as the New York Stock Exchange,
right? So New York Stock Exchange,

122
00:07:59,631 --> 00:08:04,631
it's been down in Wall Street basically
since 1792 the Giuliani administration

123
00:08:05,750 --> 00:08:10,750
with the state had negotiated a one point
$1 billion package to move them into a

124
00:08:13,761 --> 00:08:17,510
new headquarters across the street.
Said 1.1 billion.

125
00:08:17,511 --> 00:08:21,140
We don't have 1.1 billion in
this day and age. And by the way,

126
00:08:21,320 --> 00:08:25,370
we think I should also point out that
the stock market's going to go completely

127
00:08:25,371 --> 00:08:28,220
electronic. So what do they
need a whole new building for?

128
00:08:28,700 --> 00:08:33,470
Even though we had actually
already purchased on their
behalf of building across

129
00:08:33,471 --> 00:08:37,250
the street and we're paying
rent to other people,

130
00:08:37,280 --> 00:08:41,270
we just decided to kill it. And of
course the stock has changed it and move.

131
00:08:41,480 --> 00:08:45,410
And of course there's literally nobody
working on the trading floor anymore

132
00:08:45,650 --> 00:08:49,220
other than like reporters from my old
company like Bloomberg because they need a

133
00:08:49,221 --> 00:08:53,240
good stage, uh, to show what's actually
happening in financial markets.

134
00:08:53,570 --> 00:08:56,310
We did the same thing by the way,
baseball stadiums,

135
00:08:56,311 --> 00:09:01,311
both the Yankees and the mats had deals
with the Juliet Giuliani Administration

136
00:09:01,590 --> 00:09:05,580
for new stadiums that would have required
the city to put up most of the money.

137
00:09:05,581 --> 00:09:06,630
We killed them on day one.

138
00:09:07,050 --> 00:09:07,690
One of the,

139
00:09:07,690 --> 00:09:10,210
one of the interesting stories that
you talk about is when you started,

140
00:09:10,211 --> 00:09:14,560
you realized that there was this acute
housing shortage and then no one was

141
00:09:14,561 --> 00:09:17,690
addressing the affordable
housing shortage. Uh,

142
00:09:17,890 --> 00:09:22,180
and it seems like there's
plenty of housing in the
city. It's just too expensive.

143
00:09:22,420 --> 00:09:25,510
So you're saying there wasn't enough
or you were saying there wasn't enough

144
00:09:25,511 --> 00:09:27,220
housing in general?
Are there wasn't a housing

145
00:09:27,510 --> 00:09:30,970
have afforded? We said was we
believed in the future of New York.

146
00:09:30,971 --> 00:09:34,120
We came in with an extremely sort of,
despite the conditions,

147
00:09:34,121 --> 00:09:37,900
extremely optimistic view that um,

148
00:09:37,960 --> 00:09:42,670
and that the goal of a city
is actually to grow, um,

149
00:09:42,700 --> 00:09:47,650
that, you know, I just grow or die.
It's grow or die and that we needed,

150
00:09:47,651 --> 00:09:52,651
would need over time to accommodate
the growth that we hope to generate.

151
00:09:53,470 --> 00:09:58,470
And that growth would require Watsa
housing and that would require housing at

152
00:09:59,980 --> 00:10:03,190
every price point for all income levels.

153
00:10:03,430 --> 00:10:06,130
And so at a time when we
didn't have any money,

154
00:10:06,131 --> 00:10:10,540
when no one was calling for
an affordable housing plan,

155
00:10:10,890 --> 00:10:15,510
um, when in Mike's campaign,
either he nor his opponent, um,

156
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:19,690
actually had any plans for
affordable housing. Um,

157
00:10:19,720 --> 00:10:22,240
literally within months
after him becoming mayor,

158
00:10:22,241 --> 00:10:27,220
we announced what was to
become the largest municipal
affordable housing program

159
00:10:27,250 --> 00:10:31,990
of all time. Now the reality is
that even at the end of the day,

160
00:10:31,991 --> 00:10:36,400
it wasn't enough. The city actually
grew faster than we thought.

161
00:10:36,750 --> 00:10:40,390
You know, when we came into office are
about 8 million people in New York,

162
00:10:40,391 --> 00:10:43,210
there's now about 8.6
million people in New York.

163
00:10:43,211 --> 00:10:46,960
So we've added over the
last 15 years in this city,

164
00:10:47,260 --> 00:10:51,880
a city in effect the size of
Boston or bigger than Atlanta,

165
00:10:51,910 --> 00:10:55,900
I think, or Miami. And we tried
to produce enough housing.

166
00:10:55,930 --> 00:10:58,690
I don't think we actually have.
Um,

167
00:10:58,750 --> 00:11:01,300
and that it was probably one of my,

168
00:11:01,860 --> 00:11:05,450
Oh, in, in the politics
and the politics, let's,

169
00:11:05,500 --> 00:11:09,000
let's say that your mantra directly
or indirectly is grow or die, right?

170
00:11:09,180 --> 00:11:13,080
That cities need investment. And
a, I see as I walk around the city,

171
00:11:13,230 --> 00:11:14,310
nothing but construction,

172
00:11:14,730 --> 00:11:18,540
which of course inconvenience is the
traffic but produces many high paying,

173
00:11:18,541 --> 00:11:19,480
high quality jobs.

174
00:11:19,481 --> 00:11:23,370
I ever had any traffic in the Bloomberg
administration ever had any traffic. So,

175
00:11:23,730 --> 00:11:28,730
so who fights you when you
have a growth or die mindset?

176
00:11:28,980 --> 00:11:30,480
Who is your opponent?

177
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:35,980
Uh, a lot of people. Um, the, the,

178
00:11:35,981 --> 00:11:38,710
the big question is how do you
accommodate the growth, right?

179
00:11:38,740 --> 00:11:42,610
How do you physically,
so in order to accommodate that growth,

180
00:11:42,611 --> 00:11:46,810
we literally looked across
the entire city and said,

181
00:11:46,840 --> 00:11:49,730
we've got to create more,
um,

182
00:11:49,960 --> 00:11:54,550
land so people can build more housing.
Well as other stuff.

183
00:11:55,060 --> 00:11:58,870
And in order to do that, you have to
go through a process called zoning.

184
00:11:59,320 --> 00:12:04,300
And that is a extremely public process.
And we did over 12 years,

185
00:12:04,301 --> 00:12:08,590
140 separate rezonings. So, you know,

186
00:12:08,591 --> 00:12:10,300
like the area around the high line,

187
00:12:10,301 --> 00:12:13,810
which was part of one of the rezonings
West Chelsea, right? We're right here.

188
00:12:14,170 --> 00:12:19,170
So that was west of ninth avenue was
zoned complete or the guest west of 10th

189
00:12:19,331 --> 00:12:21,580
was on completely for manufacturing.

190
00:12:22,120 --> 00:12:24,700
We wanted it to have housing there.

191
00:12:24,970 --> 00:12:27,760
We also saved the high
line at the same time.

192
00:12:28,270 --> 00:12:33,150
So everybody was opposed to
it at the very beginning. Uh,

193
00:12:33,250 --> 00:12:36,250
because like they didn't want
housing across the street. I mean,

194
00:12:36,850 --> 00:12:41,850
what are the great things you'll learn
in government is no matter what your

195
00:12:42,701 --> 00:12:44,380
proposed,
no matter how good it is,

196
00:12:44,381 --> 00:12:46,930
there's going to be people that
are going to hate it. I mean,

197
00:12:46,931 --> 00:12:50,890
literally hate it and they're,
they've got a valid, um,

198
00:12:50,920 --> 00:12:55,270
a way to express it. Uh,
and you have to overcome it.

199
00:12:55,480 --> 00:12:56,231
So it,

200
00:12:56,231 --> 00:13:00,820
most likely it's going to be the local
residents who are affected by whatever it

201
00:13:00,821 --> 00:13:01,690
is you want to do.

202
00:13:01,720 --> 00:13:05,740
Because know we got good at listening
to the residents and reflecting their

203
00:13:05,741 --> 00:13:10,741
comments and doing which
lands and then mostly doing,

204
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:15,570
so if we go back to two, should
a Moses, Robert Moses, right?

205
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:18,060
That was another growth,
her die strategy,

206
00:13:18,390 --> 00:13:21,330
which ended in sort of a
horrific outcome for him. Right?

207
00:13:21,380 --> 00:13:22,950
He should have built
all the energy changes.

208
00:13:23,250 --> 00:13:25,090
And then when he finally
proposed this interchange,

209
00:13:25,091 --> 00:13:29,880
the basically a highway across Manhattan
and having sort of destroyed the south

210
00:13:29,880 --> 00:13:33,450
Bronx, um, and he's, you know, a few
years earlier that was sort of the,

211
00:13:33,451 --> 00:13:36,960
and there was this huge political
upwelling against him. Um,

212
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:41,010
how did you figure out a way
to avoid the Robert Moses fee?

213
00:13:41,660 --> 00:13:42,860
We,
a couple of things.

214
00:13:42,861 --> 00:13:45,980
One is we actually listened to
communities that was important,

215
00:13:45,981 --> 00:13:50,660
but I think the more important
thing is we basically went,

216
00:13:51,230 --> 00:13:56,150
were know as where, as few people as
possible. Actually we're so, you know,

217
00:13:56,180 --> 00:14:00,500
over the course of these 12, I think
even in the six years that I was there,

218
00:14:00,770 --> 00:14:05,540
we had completely changed the way we
thought about the city from a land use

219
00:14:05,541 --> 00:14:08,210
perspective. We rezoned, you know,

220
00:14:08,211 --> 00:14:13,211
a huge percentage of the city creating
room for 120 million square feet,

221
00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:17,300
huge and commercial areas,
residential areas. Uh,

222
00:14:17,301 --> 00:14:22,070
we created I think two,
3000 acres of parks.

223
00:14:22,400 --> 00:14:26,960
Um,
we built three stadiums or arenas.

224
00:14:27,230 --> 00:14:31,460
Um, we, you know, we talked a lot
about the affordable housing itself.

225
00:14:31,461 --> 00:14:35,840
We built a subway. Um, and
literally out of all of that,

226
00:14:35,841 --> 00:14:40,030
I think we displaced, you
know, 400 people, right?

227
00:14:40,350 --> 00:14:41,340
We didn't.
So the secret,

228
00:14:41,341 --> 00:14:45,000
the secret was finding spaces where
you could get a small percentage of

229
00:14:45,001 --> 00:14:49,200
population who are sort of annoyed and
work with them and ultimately build

230
00:14:49,201 --> 00:14:50,034
something that benefited.

231
00:14:50,430 --> 00:14:51,390
That's exactly right.
And,

232
00:14:51,391 --> 00:14:56,060
and where that tended to be is in
the old industrial areas of the city.

233
00:14:56,360 --> 00:15:00,200
People don't realize it today,
but you know, after World War Two,

234
00:15:00,230 --> 00:15:01,990
and even before World War II,

235
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:05,330
New York was like a great
manufacturing center.

236
00:15:06,050 --> 00:15:11,050
There was a million manufacturing
jobs in New York after World War II.

237
00:15:11,990 --> 00:15:16,010
By the time we came into
office there were 140,000 left.

238
00:15:16,011 --> 00:15:21,011
But because people retain this sort
of romantic notion that manufacturing,

239
00:15:21,201 --> 00:15:24,080
big manufacturing,
lots of jobs are going to come back.

240
00:15:24,500 --> 00:15:29,500
The city had never done anything with
all of the buildings and the land that

241
00:15:30,891 --> 00:15:35,000
used to be industrial but
was now essentially vacant.

242
00:15:35,180 --> 00:15:40,180
And most of that was along the waterfront
in Brooklyn and Queens on the west

243
00:15:40,731 --> 00:15:45,650
side of Manhattan and the area around
downtown Brooklyn in the South Bronx.

244
00:15:45,770 --> 00:15:48,770
And we said no more nostalgia.
Um,

245
00:15:48,830 --> 00:15:53,060
what we're going to do is make that
land available for residential,

246
00:15:53,061 --> 00:15:55,610
commercial sparks every,

247
00:15:55,640 --> 00:15:59,420
we did all these plans for all these
neighborhoods and look at long island city

248
00:15:59,421 --> 00:16:00,111
for so long.
I say,

249
00:16:00,111 --> 00:16:02,420
so I don't know how many of you
guys live in either Williamsburg,

250
00:16:02,421 --> 00:16:06,380
Greenpoint or long island city
for example. So a few here.

251
00:16:06,381 --> 00:16:10,760
Everyone else probably lives
somewhere in Brooklyn, but the uh, um,

252
00:16:11,180 --> 00:16:14,120
those areas,
there was nothing there at all.

253
00:16:14,450 --> 00:16:18,110
So you look around sorta across the
river from Manhattan and look at what's

254
00:16:18,111 --> 00:16:22,580
happening over there. None of it
existed. So downtown Brooklyn,

255
00:16:22,581 --> 00:16:24,530
by the way,
exactly the same thing,

256
00:16:25,500 --> 00:16:29,520
the, um, one of the things that
happens throughout your book,

257
00:16:29,540 --> 00:16:31,950
you just spent an awful lot of
time talking about the Olympics.

258
00:16:32,550 --> 00:16:34,530
Now had you asked me in 2002,

259
00:16:34,531 --> 00:16:38,460
if you are a crazy idea of getting the
Olympics to New York City was a good idea.

260
00:16:38,490 --> 00:16:39,690
I would have said no,

261
00:16:40,080 --> 00:16:44,370
but in your book you become more and
more convinced of your rightness.

262
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:46,470
So why don't you defend yourself now.

263
00:16:48,120 --> 00:16:52,770
But it's clear that the Olympics and more
seriously really helped you understand

264
00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:55,890
what it would take to transform
the city. Yeah. Right.

265
00:16:56,010 --> 00:16:59,460
That the mechanism of planning
for the Olympics, right.

266
00:16:59,461 --> 00:17:02,070
Forcing you to think
through every aspect of it,

267
00:17:02,250 --> 00:17:05,010
then con created the conditions
that would create the outcome. You,

268
00:17:05,280 --> 00:17:09,720
yeah. Not So. So give you a
little bit of background on that.

269
00:17:10,140 --> 00:17:15,140
So I had the crazy idea that New York
actually ought to host the Olympics.

270
00:17:15,930 --> 00:17:17,420
And I had it,
you know,

271
00:17:17,430 --> 00:17:22,430
back in 1994 when somebody asks me to go
to the World Cup semifinal game out at

272
00:17:24,121 --> 00:17:29,070
giants stadium and the metal lands
happened to be Italy versus Bulgaria,

273
00:17:29,250 --> 00:17:33,570
two teams. I could not have cared
less about an s in a sport I hated.

274
00:17:34,170 --> 00:17:34,831
Um,
and,

275
00:17:34,831 --> 00:17:39,831
and a friend dragged me out on a hundred
degree day in July to this brutally

276
00:17:40,910 --> 00:17:44,400
Kinda hot and a game.

277
00:17:44,850 --> 00:17:46,920
And we took the bus,
it took forever.

278
00:17:46,921 --> 00:17:51,420
And I'm walking into the stadium
cursing and I walk in and it's the most

279
00:17:51,421 --> 00:17:55,140
exciting event that I have ever seen.

280
00:17:55,860 --> 00:17:59,010
And I sat there thinking to myself,
you know,

281
00:17:59,430 --> 00:18:03,900
the thing that's so amazing about New
York is you could play that game in a

282
00:18:03,901 --> 00:18:08,070
stadium in New York with virtually
any two countries in the world.

283
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:12,420
And the feeling would be exactly the same.
And then as I was standing there,

284
00:18:12,421 --> 00:18:15,180
you literally couldn't sit down the
whole time I thought to myself, well,

285
00:18:15,181 --> 00:18:19,320
why has New York,
the most international city in the world,

286
00:18:19,321 --> 00:18:22,620
I've subsequently been corrected? And
it's actually Toronto, believe it or not,

287
00:18:24,330 --> 00:18:28,680
but why the mayor of Toronto
reinforces that all the time.

288
00:18:28,980 --> 00:18:30,180
Why his New York,

289
00:18:30,181 --> 00:18:35,181
the thought to be most international
city in the world never hosted the most

290
00:18:35,491 --> 00:18:37,530
international event,
the Olympics.

291
00:18:38,460 --> 00:18:43,460
So I left the stadium that day with this
vague notion that New York auto host

292
00:18:43,501 --> 00:18:44,400
the Olympics.

293
00:18:44,730 --> 00:18:48,720
And over the next two years I
researched it just on my own,

294
00:18:48,990 --> 00:18:52,680
did all sorts of research
about what it takes to win.

295
00:18:52,681 --> 00:18:55,470
Is it a good thing or bad thing?
And I finally had an insight.

296
00:18:55,920 --> 00:19:00,150
And ironically the insight
came to me from Toronto,

297
00:19:00,360 --> 00:19:03,600
which had bid for the 1996 Olympics.

298
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:08,600
We originally were focused on 2008 where
what they had done with their plan had

299
00:19:09,811 --> 00:19:14,070
placed all of the venues and then plans
for the neighborhoods around them,

300
00:19:14,520 --> 00:19:18,030
um,
on the w on your utilized waterfront.

301
00:19:18,360 --> 00:19:23,360
And the key point was at the Olympics
could be a catalyst to getting things done

302
00:19:24,390 --> 00:19:29,070
that the city had wanted to do but could
never generate the political will or

303
00:19:29,071 --> 00:19:31,980
the financial wherewithal to get done.

304
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:36,900
And what I finally concluded was you
could see the same thing just for bidding

305
00:19:36,901 --> 00:19:40,080
for the Olympics.
And so what I did was I assembled a team,

306
00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:44,190
we built a plan, um, for the city,

307
00:19:44,550 --> 00:19:49,550
the physical future of the city where we
placed sort of then use proposed venues

308
00:19:50,490 --> 00:19:54,720
in the areas that we thought
needed the most help,

309
00:19:54,930 --> 00:19:59,930
had plans for the areas around them
and figure that just by the process of

310
00:20:00,421 --> 00:20:04,320
bidding for the Olympics and the
deadlines that the bidding process impose,

311
00:20:04,650 --> 00:20:06,930
it would create the
catalyst to get things done.

312
00:20:07,530 --> 00:20:11,580
And that's actually exactly what happened,
but kind of by a fluke.

313
00:20:11,880 --> 00:20:16,680
So what happened was we developed this
plan. This is before I was deputy mayor.

314
00:20:17,340 --> 00:20:18,031
The plan,

315
00:20:18,031 --> 00:20:21,300
actually I've schlepped it to round to
all sorts of business people because I

316
00:20:21,301 --> 00:20:22,560
needed money for the bid.

317
00:20:22,561 --> 00:20:27,561
One of the people that I actually met
in that process was a guy named Mike

318
00:20:28,890 --> 00:20:33,210
Bloomberg, um, who gave me some
money and went onto our board.

319
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:36,150
Um,
actually didn't care at all about it,

320
00:20:36,151 --> 00:20:41,151
but he adopted a bunch of the ideas
when later on he ran for mayor.

321
00:20:41,790 --> 00:20:43,770
And then when in a complete shock,

322
00:20:43,771 --> 00:20:46,980
he actually won only because of nine 11.

323
00:20:47,350 --> 00:20:52,350
He asked me to join him in city hall and
do the things that I'd wanted to do as

324
00:20:55,481 --> 00:21:00,481
part of the Olympic bid and get them
all approved before the Olympic bid

325
00:21:02,051 --> 00:21:06,310
decision three years later.
And so that's exactly what we did.

326
00:21:06,311 --> 00:21:11,200
So Hudson yards, for example, guys know
about Hudson yards. That was a plan.

327
00:21:11,201 --> 00:21:13,330
That was originally Olympic plan.
The Greenpoint,

328
00:21:13,390 --> 00:21:17,800
Williamsburg waterfront was an old part
of the Olympic plan, Long Island city,

329
00:21:17,860 --> 00:21:19,870
downtown Brooklyn.
Um,

330
00:21:19,871 --> 00:21:24,790
some of the improvements in flushing and
Coney island and Harlem and the South

331
00:21:24,790 --> 00:21:29,500
Bronx, all of those were part of those
original plans. So you know, we lost,

332
00:21:29,560 --> 00:21:32,560
you know, we didn't have
the Olympics here. Um,

333
00:21:33,280 --> 00:21:36,070
but at the end of the day,
you know, we kind of won.

334
00:21:36,300 --> 00:21:39,210
But it's interesting that losing
the Olympics but having built the

335
00:21:39,211 --> 00:21:42,810
infrastructure that the Olympics was
supposed to create might be the best

336
00:21:42,811 --> 00:21:46,940
economic outcome for an Olympic city.
Right. We got to all the, see all,

337
00:21:46,950 --> 00:21:51,720
we got all the benefits from your work
now we would have had another seven years

338
00:21:51,900 --> 00:21:55,950
of deadlines to get other stuff done.
Well let's talk and so,

339
00:21:56,400 --> 00:21:58,050
and by the way,
just so you know,

340
00:21:58,380 --> 00:22:03,380
it would have been a great
celebration of what New York is,

341
00:22:03,840 --> 00:22:07,280
which is sort of my original. There
are more Olympics in the future. Nah,

342
00:22:07,370 --> 00:22:10,260
I think we've used up all the land.
There's almost no place to go.

343
00:22:11,370 --> 00:22:16,020
I that's get it off. That's at your
predecessor said. Let's talk about, uh,

344
00:22:17,580 --> 00:22:22,500
people will find a way. There is
one place, but I got my eye there,

345
00:22:23,810 --> 00:22:26,140
there, there, there are
a couple of areas in,

346
00:22:26,210 --> 00:22:31,210
in the book you talk about this where
you ultimately lost politically or for

347
00:22:31,261 --> 00:22:33,390
whatever reason. Let's, let's
talk about a few of those.

348
00:22:33,391 --> 00:22:35,040
You wanted to be last week.
Yes.

349
00:22:35,041 --> 00:22:38,280
I think it's important because it's
illustrative of how hard this stuff is,

350
00:22:38,281 --> 00:22:41,770
which is always for the average citizen.
The average is like why is this so hard?

351
00:22:41,790 --> 00:22:45,180
The answer is it's really hard.
So let's use the stadium as an example.

352
00:22:45,181 --> 00:22:49,200
You worked really hard to get a stadium.
Why do we not have a stadium there?

353
00:22:49,430 --> 00:22:50,670
Tell it,
take us through the stadium.

354
00:22:51,030 --> 00:22:55,800
So, um, so those are the guys
who weren't here at the time.

355
00:22:56,040 --> 00:22:58,110
Um,
part of the Hudson yards plan,

356
00:22:58,140 --> 00:23:03,140
only one piece of it was to build a
Reese called it the New York sports and

357
00:23:03,751 --> 00:23:05,750
convention center, which
was going to be, uh,

358
00:23:06,230 --> 00:23:08,670
an an adjunct to the convention center,

359
00:23:08,671 --> 00:23:12,330
but would also serve as the
home for the New York jets.

360
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:16,740
It's going to be an amazing facility
and we worked really hard to make it

361
00:23:16,741 --> 00:23:20,280
happen. Uh, and the reason
ultimately didn't happen.

362
00:23:20,310 --> 00:23:24,990
It was defeated in Albany,
the state capitol. Um,

363
00:23:25,140 --> 00:23:29,540
by, uh, really one guy,
the one guy's guy named

364
00:23:29,560 --> 00:23:33,550
Sheldon silver, who's the speaker of
the assembly recently heard his name.

365
00:23:33,770 --> 00:23:38,590
We have, because, uh, he
was convicted of corruption.

366
00:23:39,250 --> 00:23:41,530
Um,
and uh,

367
00:23:41,770 --> 00:23:45,560
that conviction unfortunately was
overturned on a legal technicality.

368
00:23:45,561 --> 00:23:46,340
So we are looking

369
00:23:46,340 --> 00:23:49,640
forward,
I say this very publicly to his retrial,

370
00:23:49,950 --> 00:23:54,390
but said, so you have an opinion
about Shelton, Mr Mr. Seller?

371
00:23:54,420 --> 00:23:56,820
I absolutely do.
But in any event,

372
00:23:57,460 --> 00:24:00,160
um, you know, he thought, uh,

373
00:24:00,320 --> 00:24:05,320
there were several reasons that I think
he rejected it because it all came down

374
00:24:05,861 --> 00:24:06,880
to one guy.

375
00:24:07,750 --> 00:24:12,750
One was was that he had to cozy
relationship with Madison Square Garden,

376
00:24:12,881 --> 00:24:17,170
which opposed having a competing
facility. Um, secondly,

377
00:24:17,230 --> 00:24:22,230
he thought our plans for the west side
of Manhattan would compete with the plans

378
00:24:22,691 --> 00:24:25,060
to redevelop lower Manhattan,

379
00:24:25,270 --> 00:24:29,140
which we always said what's crazy New
York and handle two big developments at

380
00:24:29,141 --> 00:24:33,680
the same time. But his district
was in lower Manhattan. Third, um,

381
00:24:33,850 --> 00:24:37,880
he was having an affair
with the lobbyist, uh, four,

382
00:24:38,150 --> 00:24:43,150
four K for Cablevision or so it
is reputed on good authority.

383
00:24:43,960 --> 00:24:48,370
Um,
and uh,

384
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:52,720
fourth his members of his, um, his, uh,

385
00:24:52,900 --> 00:24:57,900
democratic caucus who are from the west
side who were very supportive of him

386
00:24:58,931 --> 00:25:03,740
when there was an attempted coup of
him like a couple of years before. Um,

387
00:25:03,790 --> 00:25:07,580
we're very much opposed to the steam
because they hate everything that, uh,

388
00:25:07,990 --> 00:25:12,050
and to this day that is
proposed to be done, uh,

389
00:25:12,200 --> 00:25:13,150
in their district.

390
00:25:13,360 --> 00:25:18,190
And then I will say in the spirit
of complete candor was Hubris on,

391
00:25:18,440 --> 00:25:21,070
um, my, my side. Um,

392
00:25:21,090 --> 00:25:23,890
we always knew he was
going to be a problem.

393
00:25:24,250 --> 00:25:29,250
We tried to do an end run around
the legislature that end run failed.

394
00:25:30,191 --> 00:25:35,191
And I think he was basically telling us
that he was the real power and swatted

395
00:25:36,820 --> 00:25:41,110
us really me down.
So it's a combination of all of those.

396
00:25:43,090 --> 00:25:46,390
Life is tough,
but let's use another example.

397
00:25:47,170 --> 00:25:49,750
Governor Christie canceled this tunnel,

398
00:25:49,780 --> 00:25:53,920
which in my reading was critically
needed. Yup. How does this happen?

399
00:25:54,850 --> 00:25:58,340
Well, he did some other things too.
Here's how these things happen.

400
00:25:58,670 --> 00:26:00,050
It's people,

401
00:26:00,680 --> 00:26:05,120
politicians generally have no courage.

402
00:26:05,690 --> 00:26:09,050
Okay. And generally speaking, there are,

403
00:26:09,051 --> 00:26:11,390
there are clearly exceptions,

404
00:26:11,510 --> 00:26:15,500
one of whom I was incredibly
proud to serve and there
are, there are many others.

405
00:26:15,950 --> 00:26:20,150
So what for him, you know, he had
like a great first year as governor,

406
00:26:20,620 --> 00:26:21,453
um,

407
00:26:21,500 --> 00:26:26,500
and he was really popular and he started
having what all popular politicians do,

408
00:26:27,910 --> 00:26:30,200
uh,
dreams and becoming the president.

409
00:26:30,530 --> 00:26:35,530
He understood that in order to
be a viable Republican candidate,

410
00:26:36,200 --> 00:26:36,890
um,

411
00:26:36,890 --> 00:26:41,510
he needed to show sort of real sort
of fiscal toughness and conservatism.

412
00:26:41,840 --> 00:26:46,840
So he ended up this plan to build a new
tunnel between New Jersey and New York

413
00:26:49,831 --> 00:26:50,664
City.

414
00:26:50,910 --> 00:26:55,170
He claimed that he had no
confidence that the cost of it,

415
00:26:55,590 --> 00:26:58,200
you know, would come
in where they said, um,

416
00:26:58,230 --> 00:27:01,860
which itself was probably not totally
unfair, but he just killed it.

417
00:27:02,310 --> 00:27:06,750
And as the single dumbest thing that
you could ever do for New Jersey,

418
00:27:07,110 --> 00:27:11,210
New Jersey at the end of
the day exists because,

419
00:27:11,600 --> 00:27:12,433
because two,

420
00:27:16,400 --> 00:27:21,260
please continue. By the way, I
just in my, in my defense here,

421
00:27:21,261 --> 00:27:22,550
I wasn't in my friend's living,

422
00:27:25,100 --> 00:27:28,190
I was born in Newark. So, uh, go ahead.

423
00:27:28,210 --> 00:27:32,660
What am I saying that my parents made
the wise decision to move to Detroit. So,

424
00:27:32,730 --> 00:27:37,010
uh,
so in any of it,

425
00:27:37,060 --> 00:27:37,191
no,

426
00:27:37,191 --> 00:27:42,191
I didn't mean New Jersey benefits by
virtue of its proximity to New York City.

427
00:27:43,691 --> 00:27:48,160
The more people who can get in and
out of New York from New Jersey,

428
00:27:48,370 --> 00:27:52,240
it's a corollary of my
virtuous cycle of growth,

429
00:27:52,241 --> 00:27:57,241
grow or die for New Jersey to grow
more people have to keep coming

430
00:27:57,690 --> 00:28:01,290
in and out. In New York if you want to
increase the aggregate growth rate of the

431
00:28:01,291 --> 00:28:05,220
metropolitan region, you have to increase
its connectivity, right? In all forms.

432
00:28:05,250 --> 00:28:05,540
Nope.

433
00:28:05,540 --> 00:28:06,291
By the way,

434
00:28:06,291 --> 00:28:11,291
you probably read like these
tunnels between New York
and New Jersey are ancient

435
00:28:12,440 --> 00:28:16,410
and there's pose a huge risk and one of
them is a hundred years old and it has

436
00:28:16,411 --> 00:28:18,160
to be shut down.
It's going to collapse now.

437
00:28:18,170 --> 00:28:21,770
We're going to spend many times
more money. It'll take a lot.

438
00:28:21,771 --> 00:28:24,950
We're spending really risking.
So speaking of don't live in New Jersey

439
00:28:26,750 --> 00:28:30,650
seeking of interconnectivity,
um, the city has,

440
00:28:31,700 --> 00:28:34,750
so, so the good news is there's more
housing, there's more economic activities,

441
00:28:34,760 --> 00:28:37,190
more buildings,
more travel and its economic growth.

442
00:28:37,460 --> 00:28:41,300
And it is really the center of economic
growth for America today as a whole.

443
00:28:41,301 --> 00:28:42,134
And congratulations.

444
00:28:42,250 --> 00:28:44,330
And by the way,
during the Bloomberg era,

445
00:28:44,540 --> 00:28:49,540
job growth in the city was more than
double the national growth rate.

446
00:28:51,330 --> 00:28:55,460
Uh, and more, most importantly
New York, cause it's a very,

447
00:28:55,530 --> 00:28:59,960
it's a cyclical city generally because
we're so dependent on financial services

448
00:29:00,410 --> 00:29:05,410
tends to go into recession faster and
come out slower because the recovery of

449
00:29:07,581 --> 00:29:12,581
the financial system and financial
services firms tends to be slower in this,

450
00:29:13,500 --> 00:29:15,260
um,
fit in the financial crisis.

451
00:29:15,261 --> 00:29:20,261
The reverse happened because we actually
were successful very deliberately in

452
00:29:20,781 --> 00:29:25,490
diversifying the economy. So that
included, you know, life sciences,

453
00:29:25,491 --> 00:29:29,150
higher education where we
made lots of investments or

454
00:29:29,740 --> 00:29:29,831
yeah,

455
00:29:29,831 --> 00:29:32,290
you actually identify what are the things
you did in your initial plan as you

456
00:29:32,291 --> 00:29:34,300
identified sectors of life sciences,

457
00:29:34,301 --> 00:29:38,350
being in a film and television producer
in Rockefeller University and those

458
00:29:38,351 --> 00:29:41,020
kinds of things. But, but
this is a lead up to my,

459
00:29:41,410 --> 00:29:44,530
that the good news is you built
this incredibly strong city.

460
00:29:44,800 --> 00:29:47,380
The bad news is taxes are incredibly high.

461
00:29:47,890 --> 00:29:49,570
They're still an
affordability housing problem.

462
00:29:49,571 --> 00:29:52,000
And the transportation is very difficult.

463
00:29:52,120 --> 00:29:55,800
I'm going to use the word sucks now and,

464
00:29:55,840 --> 00:29:58,220
and there was a summer of
hell, right this, this pens to,

465
00:29:58,230 --> 00:30:00,040
and this is one problem after the other.

466
00:30:00,310 --> 00:30:04,360
And that's something that the
private sector cannot fix, right?

467
00:30:04,570 --> 00:30:09,570
It requires sustained coordination
across all three states and the city.

468
00:30:10,480 --> 00:30:13,750
Is it just going to get worse?
So the answer

469
00:30:13,810 --> 00:30:18,280
is hopefully not. Um, and I should,

470
00:30:18,281 --> 00:30:21,670
let's talk, we talked a little bit
about affordability where it said,

471
00:30:21,671 --> 00:30:24,650
I think the city just grew faster.
Um,

472
00:30:24,700 --> 00:30:29,530
then for then we were able
to produce housing. Um,

473
00:30:30,090 --> 00:30:32,770
talk about kind of transportation system.

474
00:30:32,920 --> 00:30:37,870
I will say that from
the mass transit system,

475
00:30:38,470 --> 00:30:42,020
um, it's not the city's fault. Um,

476
00:30:42,040 --> 00:30:45,970
and the reason is the mass transit
systems controlled by the state.

477
00:30:46,570 --> 00:30:48,160
And you know,
we talked about,

478
00:30:48,161 --> 00:30:53,161
we had one other big failure and that
failure was back in 2007 as part of what

479
00:30:54,641 --> 00:30:58,000
we called plan YC,
which was New York sustainability plan,

480
00:30:58,001 --> 00:31:01,480
which is our plan for the
physical future of the city.

481
00:31:01,481 --> 00:31:04,260
Looking out over 25 years.
Um,

482
00:31:04,300 --> 00:31:09,280
we proposed a completely different
approach to mass transit,

483
00:31:09,850 --> 00:31:13,450
a core piece of which was
going to be congestion pricing.

484
00:31:13,810 --> 00:31:16,060
For those of you who've been
in London or maybe Singapore,

485
00:31:16,061 --> 00:31:20,890
you know that when you
enter a zone, um, the,

486
00:31:20,920 --> 00:31:24,640
uh, you pay a in a car, I'm not taxis,

487
00:31:24,641 --> 00:31:27,190
but private vehicles,
you actually pay a fee.

488
00:31:27,190 --> 00:31:32,190
We proposed and $8 fee below 86th street
in Manhattan and it was ultimately

489
00:31:34,061 --> 00:31:38,810
going to generate like $1 billion
a year. And we promised, um,

490
00:31:39,070 --> 00:31:43,930
that all of that would be given to
the MTA, which we don't even control,

491
00:31:43,931 --> 00:31:47,230
which is run by the state, run
by the state, could be bonded,

492
00:31:47,231 --> 00:31:52,000
combined with an additional
annual contribution in the
city would make and the

493
00:31:52,001 --> 00:31:53,690
state would make,
um,

494
00:31:53,740 --> 00:31:58,740
could fund $50 billion in mass transit
improvements and all of it would have

495
00:31:59,891 --> 00:32:04,600
been guaranteed. And we even specify
what lines we're going to get added,

496
00:32:04,750 --> 00:32:08,290
what subway stations we're
going to get improved. You know,

497
00:32:08,291 --> 00:32:12,970
how much greater frequency bus
rapid transit, like a whole plan.

498
00:32:13,550 --> 00:32:16,720
But the core of it was congestion pricing.
And by the way,

499
00:32:16,721 --> 00:32:17,740
just in terms of statistics,

500
00:32:17,741 --> 00:32:22,741
this gives you a sense for how politics
actually works among in the districts of

501
00:32:22,991 --> 00:32:27,220
the legislators because this had to get
approved in Albany who we're going to be

502
00:32:27,221 --> 00:32:29,830
most affected by congestion pricing.

503
00:32:29,830 --> 00:32:33,520
The ones typically like
on the outer boroughs, um,

504
00:32:33,521 --> 00:32:36,160
on the other side of the river.
Um,

505
00:32:36,250 --> 00:32:41,250
literally like 5% of constituents
drove into Manhattan and 95% would have

506
00:32:45,501 --> 00:32:49,640
benefited from these mass
transit improvements. But again,

507
00:32:49,670 --> 00:32:54,320
it was defeated by the
same guy up in Albany. Um,

508
00:32:54,350 --> 00:32:56,090
and will you have an opinion?
Well,

509
00:32:56,120 --> 00:33:01,030
I have an opinion about now what is
interesting as result of the summer of how

510
00:33:01,050 --> 00:33:03,860
and all the underfunding
of the transit system,

511
00:33:04,070 --> 00:33:07,400
the idea of congestion pricing are
totally the bridges coming back.

512
00:33:07,401 --> 00:33:10,400
So the good news, I guess they
still have to solve this problem.

513
00:33:10,430 --> 00:33:12,410
Let me ask you one final quick question.

514
00:33:12,411 --> 00:33:15,610
Good news is we'll eventually
be proven to be correct. Okay.

515
00:33:16,130 --> 00:33:19,970
The bad news is it'll probably
happen 15 years later, but um, yeah.

516
00:33:19,971 --> 00:33:21,530
Usually when you push problems off,

517
00:33:21,531 --> 00:33:25,700
they physically are you sure
you're better off fixing them.

518
00:33:25,701 --> 00:33:30,160
Now I have one final question and I'd
like to ask the audience for your comments

519
00:33:30,161 --> 00:33:35,120
or questions. Um, what's the weirdest or
funniest thing Donald Trump did with you?

520
00:33:38,040 --> 00:33:42,760
Uh, I'll tell you two quick
stories that I think, um,

521
00:33:43,280 --> 00:33:47,330
illustrate my general rule
that people just don't change.

522
00:33:47,390 --> 00:33:50,510
And everything we're saying
was ultimately predictable.

523
00:33:50,870 --> 00:33:54,230
And I will point out that I actually had
a pretty good relationship with them.

524
00:33:54,231 --> 00:33:57,320
But you know what? Columbus circle. Um,

525
00:33:57,500 --> 00:33:59,930
so the city actually,

526
00:34:00,440 --> 00:34:05,390
I inherited a piece of property,
um,

527
00:34:05,510 --> 00:34:10,100
that we decide we're going to sell
off this in 2002 when we had no money.

528
00:34:10,101 --> 00:34:11,930
And in the previous administration,

529
00:34:12,110 --> 00:34:16,730
they'd gone through a process and they'd
selected Trump who is going to build a

530
00:34:16,880 --> 00:34:20,420
luxury boutique gold plated hotel.

531
00:34:20,990 --> 00:34:24,290
And so we decided we ought to see what
else is out there. So we went out,

532
00:34:24,291 --> 00:34:29,030
we did an RFP and there were
really two bitters for it. One was,

533
00:34:29,100 --> 00:34:32,810
um, Trump who wanted to build
the same gold plated hotel.

534
00:34:32,980 --> 00:34:34,920
I actually don't remember for
sure that it was gold play,

535
00:34:34,930 --> 00:34:38,270
but you can imagine it would have been.
And um,

536
00:34:38,330 --> 00:34:43,250
and the other was a small museum that
wanted to move to a more prominent

537
00:34:43,251 --> 00:34:46,220
location on Columbus Circle.
And this,

538
00:34:46,221 --> 00:34:49,610
this building had been a museum.
So anyway,

539
00:34:49,611 --> 00:34:54,470
so we get the bids and Trump
offers all cash, a lot more money.

540
00:34:54,920 --> 00:34:59,360
Um, and uh, we'll pay today
or that, you know, right away.

541
00:34:59,540 --> 00:35:03,170
And the museum, which had no
money offered to pay less money,

542
00:35:03,410 --> 00:35:07,850
would pay when they could raise
it, um, if the, if they could.

543
00:35:08,420 --> 00:35:10,700
So needless to say,
we chose the museum.

544
00:35:13,720 --> 00:35:18,720
So now you can imagine the call
with Trump to inform him that,

545
00:35:20,210 --> 00:35:24,530
um, we had selected this pathetic
little museum, which by the way,

546
00:35:24,531 --> 00:35:29,510
if you haven't been to the Museum
of art and design is a great museum.

547
00:35:30,080 --> 00:35:33,320
So you can imagine sort of how
that call went and you know,

548
00:35:33,890 --> 00:35:35,600
but this is the more interesting story.

549
00:35:35,601 --> 00:35:40,601
I did not hear a word from him for like
another 15 months until the day after

550
00:35:42,960 --> 00:35:46,170
the apprentice debuted on NBC.

551
00:35:47,160 --> 00:35:52,160
And I get a call the next
day from him out of the blue.

552
00:35:53,820 --> 00:35:58,820
And the entire point of the call was
for him to tell me the ratings of the

553
00:36:00,241 --> 00:36:01,140
apprentice.

554
00:36:03,780 --> 00:36:08,780
I literally had not heard from the guy
for 15 months and I could not have been

555
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:13,860
number like 1000 on his list,
but was more amazing.

556
00:36:13,861 --> 00:36:18,861
Was he called me every week like clockwork
for the next three weeks to tell me

557
00:36:19,111 --> 00:36:23,250
the rate. Are you sure he didn't confuse
you with a different, I don't think so.

558
00:36:23,490 --> 00:36:26,070
So here's the final thing,
which we'll again,

559
00:36:26,071 --> 00:36:30,930
we'll tell you everything you need
to know. So on the day I die, I,

560
00:36:30,990 --> 00:36:34,110
we announced that I was leaving
city hall to go to Bloomberg.

561
00:36:34,140 --> 00:36:37,650
I sent out a note to like a
thousand people, you know,

562
00:36:37,651 --> 00:36:41,760
who I'd worked with saying what a great
experience and an honor, blah, blah, blah.

563
00:36:41,790 --> 00:36:46,390
It was, and yeah,

564
00:36:46,400 --> 00:36:50,240
attached the press release of all
the great things that we did. Um,

565
00:36:50,440 --> 00:36:54,490
and like hundreds of people wrote back
these incredibly nice notes. I mean,

566
00:36:54,520 --> 00:36:59,260
it was, it was really moving.
So I get one back from, from,

567
00:36:59,290 --> 00:37:01,870
uh, from Trump. And, uh,

568
00:37:02,170 --> 00:37:07,170
what he had done was he had a scammed
printed out and scanned my email,

569
00:37:10,670 --> 00:37:15,130
um, after and then circled
on it. No, say wrote,

570
00:37:15,160 --> 00:37:19,240
great job, exclamation point,
exclamation, some big felt tip pen.

571
00:37:19,690 --> 00:37:24,250
And then down below there was a
little typo in my email to him.

572
00:37:24,251 --> 00:37:28,990
That was actually two periods at the
end of a sentence. He circled it.

573
00:37:30,130 --> 00:37:33,370
This is the guy who
spells taps with two P's.

574
00:37:35,140 --> 00:37:39,890
He circled it and put an exclamation point
on.

575
00:37:39,950 --> 00:37:41,860
How do you explain that
since from our audience?

576
00:37:44,990 --> 00:37:47,520
My question is, how can the city, uh,

577
00:37:47,521 --> 00:37:51,500
arrest control from Albany in order
to do some of the things that you've

578
00:37:51,501 --> 00:37:55,040
described? Well, one
option would be to succeed.

579
00:37:59,950 --> 00:38:04,950
I was known to privately advocate that
from time to time the answer is actually

580
00:38:07,210 --> 00:38:10,200
a more creeping takeover.
Um,

581
00:38:10,450 --> 00:38:15,450
so I talk a little bit in the book about
a governor's island and Brooklyn Bridge

582
00:38:16,210 --> 00:38:20,310
Park. You guys all been to governor's
island, Brooklyn Bridge Park. So, um,

583
00:38:20,350 --> 00:38:22,210
we actually,
um,

584
00:38:22,270 --> 00:38:26,260
bought both governors island and the
land underlying governor's island and

585
00:38:26,261 --> 00:38:30,340
Brooklyn Bridge Park in
partnership with the state.

586
00:38:30,900 --> 00:38:32,380
Um,
early on,

587
00:38:32,440 --> 00:38:37,390
literally in the first six months to
a of the Bloomberg administration and

588
00:38:37,391 --> 00:38:41,470
managing it with the state.
Both of them was awful.

589
00:38:41,950 --> 00:38:45,580
Um, you know, they wouldn't share
information, they are incredibly slow,

590
00:38:45,581 --> 00:38:49,660
bureaucratic, whatever, and
it was really frustrating.

591
00:38:50,110 --> 00:38:51,430
So,
uh,

592
00:38:51,820 --> 00:38:56,820
eventually I got so frustrated that I
brought a team together and we developed a

593
00:38:58,301 --> 00:39:02,030
plan, which we called Project Repo, uh,

594
00:39:02,170 --> 00:39:07,170
to buy the state out of its interests
in governor's island and Brooklyn Bridge

595
00:39:09,700 --> 00:39:14,630
Park. And at first week we
close to having a deal. Um,

596
00:39:14,650 --> 00:39:19,650
when our governor Pataki was
governor then Eliot Spitzer name,

597
00:39:19,690 --> 00:39:24,690
many of you may remember who was governor
for about 15 months until he had a sex

598
00:39:25,541 --> 00:39:29,110
scandal. Um, he didn't want
anything to do with it.

599
00:39:29,230 --> 00:39:34,230
He was so insistent on state control
over literally as much as possible.

600
00:39:34,810 --> 00:39:39,810
And so we waited and this happened after
I left for his successor to come when

601
00:39:39,851 --> 00:39:44,680
the city's position, after the financial
crisis was stronger than the states.

602
00:39:45,160 --> 00:39:50,160
And my successor actually agreed to
buy their out their interests and no

603
00:39:51,200 --> 00:39:52,930
intimate too to a large degree,

604
00:39:52,931 --> 00:39:56,980
that incredible public spaces that,
um,

605
00:39:57,010 --> 00:40:01,960
Brooklyn Bridge Park and governor's
island are as a result of that decision to

606
00:40:01,961 --> 00:40:02,621
buy them out.

607
00:40:02,621 --> 00:40:07,540
So the reality is beyond like
weird situations like that,

608
00:40:07,990 --> 00:40:10,300
the truth is we just have
to do our best job. In fact,

609
00:40:10,301 --> 00:40:11,980
I would say one of my great regrets,

610
00:40:11,981 --> 00:40:16,981
I joke a lot about the state is that I
should have been up in Albany a lot more,

611
00:40:17,300 --> 00:40:20,790
um, being nice to those guys. Um, instead,

612
00:40:20,830 --> 00:40:24,940
the path I chose was to ignore
them as much as possible.

613
00:40:25,420 --> 00:40:27,280
And for the most part that worked fine.

614
00:40:27,310 --> 00:40:31,010
The couple of times I talked about
didn't work so well. Yeah. All right,

615
00:40:31,011 --> 00:40:34,780
next question. Where do you live?
Upper west side. Upper West.

616
00:40:35,580 --> 00:40:38,880
We're neighbors. Yes. Originally
from the suburbs of Detroit.

617
00:40:38,940 --> 00:40:42,270
And understand you grew up there as well.
Which one? Uh, from Huntington Woods.

618
00:40:42,420 --> 00:40:43,980
My brother lives in Huntington against.

619
00:40:44,940 --> 00:40:49,940
What can Detroit learn from New York City?
That's a great question.

620
00:40:50,120 --> 00:40:52,910
Um, and uh, uh,

621
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:56,870
I actually gave a speech
about this every year.

622
00:40:56,930 --> 00:41:00,730
Detroit has like this homecoming
event for people who fled Detroit,

623
00:41:01,680 --> 00:41:03,660
you know, and, and you know,

624
00:41:03,690 --> 00:41:07,350
Bidwell somewhere else and they want
to get them encouraged. By the way,

625
00:41:07,351 --> 00:41:11,310
I should say, I think Detroit is
actually on the upswing, but I,

626
00:41:11,340 --> 00:41:15,230
I did give this speech and I actually,
um,

627
00:41:15,570 --> 00:41:19,860
analogize Detroit, not to New
York City, but instead to Harlem,

628
00:41:19,890 --> 00:41:22,590
which has begun to see a real renaissance.
And I,

629
00:41:22,910 --> 00:41:27,210
I gave like four pieces of advice.
The first is at the end of the day,

630
00:41:27,390 --> 00:41:31,710
where you really make progress is not on
the stadiums or even the shiny downtown,

631
00:41:31,711 --> 00:41:34,100
which is fine.
It's in the neighborhoods.

632
00:41:34,101 --> 00:41:38,060
And so you really got to focus on the
little stuff of building neighborhoods,

633
00:41:38,300 --> 00:41:41,180
making them safer,
improving education,

634
00:41:41,390 --> 00:41:44,930
clearing out the vacant lots,
all of which, by the way,

635
00:41:44,931 --> 00:41:47,300
I think the current
mayor who's really good,

636
00:41:47,330 --> 00:41:51,860
it focused on second is you can't
be impatient. You know, when,

637
00:41:51,890 --> 00:41:56,050
when I was born, I'm older
than you. Um, in 1958,

638
00:41:56,051 --> 00:41:58,880
Detroit had 1.8 5 million people.

639
00:41:59,060 --> 00:42:02,570
Today the population is maybe 650,000,

640
00:42:02,900 --> 00:42:07,900
so it took 60 years to get into this
mess and it's going to take several

641
00:42:08,901 --> 00:42:13,610
generations. And so what you
have to actually be his patient.

642
00:42:14,120 --> 00:42:17,930
The third piece of advice
is you gotta be diverse.

643
00:42:18,530 --> 00:42:20,480
Um, you know, Detroit,

644
00:42:20,900 --> 00:42:25,900
the population is essentially shrunk so
much that a lot of the people left are

645
00:42:26,661 --> 00:42:31,100
the ones who really couldn't
leave. And so, you know,

646
00:42:31,101 --> 00:42:35,630
the percentage that have any sort of
college education is extremely low.

647
00:42:36,170 --> 00:42:36,860
Um,

648
00:42:36,860 --> 00:42:41,860
and what you need to do is reflate the
city and the way you reflate the cities

649
00:42:42,591 --> 00:42:45,710
by being more diverse. And
some of that is, you know,

650
00:42:45,711 --> 00:42:48,860
people being attracted back
to the city from the suburbs.

651
00:42:49,070 --> 00:42:53,210
I think a big part of it is
really encouraging immigration.

652
00:42:53,660 --> 00:42:56,270
Um, but again, you grow or you die.

653
00:42:56,271 --> 00:43:01,130
Detroit is the exact opposite of
what we hope to do here in New York.

654
00:43:01,131 --> 00:43:04,580
And I'd say, you know, the last
part is Troy can't do it alone.

655
00:43:04,970 --> 00:43:08,960
It's gotten relatively meager help from
the federal government to go through.

656
00:43:08,961 --> 00:43:11,550
It's bail out. It went through
bankruptcy to go through. It's valid.

657
00:43:11,560 --> 00:43:14,000
It did get help from the state.
Um,

658
00:43:14,090 --> 00:43:17,330
and there's complicated political
issues between the city and the state.

659
00:43:18,090 --> 00:43:22,850
Harlem as an example, had New
York City, we invested, you know,

660
00:43:22,851 --> 00:43:27,290
I'm guessing over time,
billions of dollars in housing in Harlem,

661
00:43:27,760 --> 00:43:31,340
incredibly trends and, and it is, um,

662
00:43:31,370 --> 00:43:35,630
it's really transformed. And so a lot
of that wasn't affordable housing.

663
00:43:35,780 --> 00:43:39,220
So it's those four things. Let's go
ahead. Yes, sir. Where do you live?

664
00:43:39,650 --> 00:43:41,720
I actually grew up in the West village.

665
00:43:42,260 --> 00:43:46,400
My first job for five years actually
worked for community board to posting

666
00:43:46,670 --> 00:43:50,500
zoning signs. Uh, so very
familiar with that. Uh,

667
00:43:50,620 --> 00:43:52,820
and I currently live in Brooklyn Heights.
Um,

668
00:43:53,150 --> 00:43:56,300
I guess so my question having grown up
in the city and having seen so much of

669
00:43:56,301 --> 00:43:59,750
the transformation during
my lifetime, um, you know,

670
00:43:59,870 --> 00:44:03,260
neighborhood that I grew up in is now
very different from the one that used to

671
00:44:03,261 --> 00:44:07,820
be and is now starting to contemplate
home buying myself. Let me ask you,

672
00:44:07,821 --> 00:44:11,600
in a great tradition of New York,
you know, conversation, where would,

673
00:44:11,720 --> 00:44:14,960
where would you be excited about
as a value buy in the city?

674
00:44:15,810 --> 00:44:17,920
Ah,
and why?

675
00:44:19,080 --> 00:44:21,780
Because I also know you play
three dimensional chess. Really?

676
00:44:21,781 --> 00:44:24,210
Why as opposed to where
you would want us to move.

677
00:44:24,850 --> 00:44:27,990
Okay.
We're giving

678
00:44:27,990 --> 00:44:31,500
you advice. Um, and I will concede,

679
00:44:31,501 --> 00:44:34,460
I'm slightly out of date on this and you,

680
00:44:34,470 --> 00:44:39,330
what you were really looking for is
value place where I think assuming the

681
00:44:39,331 --> 00:44:41,220
continued growth occurs,

682
00:44:41,460 --> 00:44:46,320
you'll see the fastest growth or
probably be in the South Bronx. Um,

683
00:44:46,380 --> 00:44:49,620
and there's a reason for that one,
it's really close to Manhattan,

684
00:44:49,621 --> 00:44:54,030
midtown Manhattan or Manhattan. If find
the right place, it's on the subway.

685
00:44:54,031 --> 00:44:58,800
There's some interesting building stock
there. You're starting to see it happen.

686
00:44:58,801 --> 00:45:03,180
It's gotten dramatically safer.
That would be certainly one area.

687
00:45:03,540 --> 00:45:04,373
Uh,
you know,

688
00:45:04,710 --> 00:45:09,710
it's Kinda late now for places in northern
Manhattan like Washington heights and

689
00:45:10,380 --> 00:45:13,330
that area there. But I think
that's a great neighborhood. Yeah.

690
00:45:13,590 --> 00:45:16,770
You can just take the subway map,
always look at the,

691
00:45:16,850 --> 00:45:20,670
take a subway map and look
at the relative rents, right.

692
00:45:20,671 --> 00:45:25,260
And then decide where you are and then
make a judgment of how they'll appreciate.

693
00:45:25,740 --> 00:45:30,150
Yeah. The closer you are
to Manhattan, I think,

694
00:45:30,600 --> 00:45:34,050
um, uh, from a mass trans,
that's where the greatest value.

695
00:45:34,051 --> 00:45:39,051
So look at the relative value
relative to the distance.

696
00:45:39,330 --> 00:45:43,350
And that's where you'll generally find
pretty much any place in New York now

697
00:45:43,351 --> 00:45:48,351
though is dramatically more
livable than it was 15 years ago.

698
00:45:48,811 --> 00:45:52,770
One of your, one of Mike's priorities was
in fact the Bronx in general. We have,

699
00:45:52,850 --> 00:45:57,150
you know, we had this whole five
borough strategies. So, um, you know,

700
00:45:57,210 --> 00:46:00,360
and what I'm really proud ist of is said,

701
00:46:00,361 --> 00:46:05,361
the areas that we invested the most in
have seen the most dramatic increases in

702
00:46:07,261 --> 00:46:11,730
job creation and business
formation, um, as well.

703
00:46:12,030 --> 00:46:15,560
So, um, you know, look,
I also find, you know,

704
00:46:15,660 --> 00:46:17,970
big parts of Queens to be very compelling.

705
00:46:18,300 --> 00:46:22,710
It depends on how easy it is to get
into get into Manhattan. And by the way,

706
00:46:22,711 --> 00:46:27,230
I'm not saying that you have to have
access to Manhattan, the heat. He's,

707
00:46:27,390 --> 00:46:30,890
he was federal property values,
property value. Yeah. We,

708
00:46:30,930 --> 00:46:33,480
this is the financial industry,
a lot of that. Yes sir.

709
00:46:33,481 --> 00:46:35,220
Where do you sunset parks and other one.

710
00:46:35,420 --> 00:46:37,380
Hey, I'm Steve. I live
in Williamsburg. Yeah.

711
00:46:37,760 --> 00:46:41,510
I was wondering if you could talk a little
bit about the reality of construction

712
00:46:41,511 --> 00:46:43,430
costs in New York. Um, and I,

713
00:46:43,431 --> 00:46:47,000
I mean that because you talked about
revenue sources that don't exist.

714
00:46:47,240 --> 00:46:50,840
You talked about Christie killing
the tunnel project because of sort of

715
00:46:50,841 --> 00:46:53,450
political considerations,
but our costs,

716
00:46:53,480 --> 00:46:57,200
there seems to be a persistent gap
between the estimation and the reality.

717
00:46:57,330 --> 00:46:59,800
It's probably not the
estimation in the reality.

718
00:46:59,801 --> 00:47:04,480
It's just that costs here
are way too high. And um,

719
00:47:04,970 --> 00:47:06,910
and if you compare like building us,

720
00:47:06,940 --> 00:47:11,940
typically a s like a high rise building
in New Jersey versus New York City,

721
00:47:12,940 --> 00:47:16,090
um, it's like 35% difference, 35%,

722
00:47:16,091 --> 00:47:20,840
and at the same labor force, same basic
labor of wines at 35% more expensive.

723
00:47:21,490 --> 00:47:26,260
The biggest issue is it's actually
not the, this different labor rules.

724
00:47:26,770 --> 00:47:31,770
And so the Labor in New York City are
infinite for union work are infinitely

725
00:47:35,531 --> 00:47:38,410
more generous than they are in New Jersey.

726
00:47:38,710 --> 00:47:42,160
And that's just like years of contractors,
you know,

727
00:47:42,161 --> 00:47:47,161
who negotiate with the unions
basically giving away a lot more.

728
00:47:47,620 --> 00:47:50,370
Um, and um, big part of that,

729
00:47:50,371 --> 00:47:53,170
it's not so much the wage is per se,

730
00:47:53,590 --> 00:47:55,900
it is the feather bedding.

731
00:47:55,930 --> 00:48:00,930
It is the work rules that make
it just a lot more expensive.

732
00:48:02,260 --> 00:48:06,010
Um, so the question is
what do you do about that?

733
00:48:06,010 --> 00:48:09,540
And the presumably with that 35% applies
to affordable housing as well. Well,

734
00:48:09,541 --> 00:48:12,030
it's, this is the
interesting question. Um,

735
00:48:12,250 --> 00:48:17,250
it does in many cases because the
city's rules require when it's spent,

736
00:48:18,641 --> 00:48:23,641
when it is using its money to
pay for something in some form,

737
00:48:23,920 --> 00:48:27,850
it tends to require La
Union labor be used.

738
00:48:27,851 --> 00:48:29,470
And that's kind of a political thing.

739
00:48:30,070 --> 00:48:34,060
What's happening though is that,
um,

740
00:48:34,090 --> 00:48:38,500
nonunion labor is
becoming much more common.

741
00:48:38,680 --> 00:48:43,570
The percentage of buildings that are
built with UDN labour in the city is

742
00:48:43,571 --> 00:48:46,840
actually coming down.
So the market is kind of working,

743
00:48:47,110 --> 00:48:51,670
but it's not really an efficient market
because there are all these rules that

744
00:48:51,970 --> 00:48:55,420
basically government imposes.
As a side question,

745
00:48:55,421 --> 00:49:00,310
do you have an opinion about the 57
street corridor and all the huge apartment

746
00:49:00,311 --> 00:49:03,820
complexes that are unsold and
occupying my visual space?

747
00:49:05,580 --> 00:49:08,620
You know, I look, I think, um, uh,

748
00:49:09,730 --> 00:49:12,220
one in particular is hideously ugly.

749
00:49:12,220 --> 00:49:17,080
So that's a problem happened after
I was there. Just to be clear. Um,

750
00:49:17,440 --> 00:49:21,310
you know, look, I have a,
there's a, there's a couple
of things wrapped up in that.

751
00:49:21,340 --> 00:49:25,630
One is are the buildings too tall?
And you know,

752
00:49:25,631 --> 00:49:27,310
I have two minds of that.

753
00:49:27,311 --> 00:49:31,750
One is they're kind of not in
context and for Central Park.

754
00:49:31,751 --> 00:49:35,530
And the view from central park.
On the other hand, you know,

755
00:49:35,620 --> 00:49:39,640
I do believe that New York is an
aspirational city and should be reaching

756
00:49:39,641 --> 00:49:42,990
basically for the sky. Um, you know,

757
00:49:43,900 --> 00:49:45,630
ever hire.
Um,

758
00:49:45,700 --> 00:49:50,700
the second part is whether I actually
care that there's a bunch of billionaires

759
00:49:52,100 --> 00:49:56,590
buying, um, apartments
there and not living there.

760
00:49:57,160 --> 00:50:02,160
And the truth and matter is I actually
don't care so much because that was never

761
00:50:04,691 --> 00:50:07,690
going to be a place where there's
going to be like affordable housing or

762
00:50:07,691 --> 00:50:08,524
anything.

763
00:50:08,950 --> 00:50:13,950
And the more economic activity that we
can generate here that helps [inaudible]

764
00:50:15,150 --> 00:50:19,030
construction workers or other people,
that's a good thing.

765
00:50:19,060 --> 00:50:23,380
Eventually what I do regret is there
were tax abatements for some of those

766
00:50:23,381 --> 00:50:25,510
buildings that probably
shouldn't have been there,

767
00:50:25,630 --> 00:50:27,950
but eventually they'll start paying taxes.

768
00:50:28,190 --> 00:50:32,690
So I don't really see it like soaking
up the man because you've got this

769
00:50:32,691 --> 00:50:36,860
rarefied group of people who are going
to be paying lots of money creating

770
00:50:36,861 --> 00:50:41,720
economic activity and it wouldn't
affect anything else. Where do you live?

771
00:50:42,090 --> 00:50:46,460
All right. I live in the West village and
I'm originally from Oakland, California.

772
00:50:47,120 --> 00:50:47,600
Um,

773
00:50:47,600 --> 00:50:51,320
so I was working at Google in mountain
view for five years and then I moved out

774
00:50:51,321 --> 00:50:55,700
here two and a half years ago. I have
an affordable housing question. Uh,

775
00:50:55,701 --> 00:50:59,960
so in New York I've seen that there seems
to be much greater affordable housing

776
00:50:59,961 --> 00:51:03,200
stock out here versus where
I come from in the bay area.

777
00:51:03,530 --> 00:51:08,120
I was wondering if you were
advising policy makers in
the San Francisco Bay area,

778
00:51:08,420 --> 00:51:13,220
what best practices from New York and
affordable housing would you reckon?

779
00:51:13,480 --> 00:51:15,160
Great. It's a great,
it's a great question.

780
00:51:15,190 --> 00:51:20,050
So New York and the bay area really
different for several reasons,

781
00:51:20,051 --> 00:51:24,750
but the most important of which
is, you know, New York, um,

782
00:51:25,120 --> 00:51:26,570
city,
um,

783
00:51:26,650 --> 00:51:31,650
is one city and we can think very
comprehensively over a large area.

784
00:51:33,460 --> 00:51:36,760
Um, now it's not the region. Um,

785
00:51:36,820 --> 00:51:41,820
but New York City is a big entity and
so we sort of saw the whole city as a

786
00:51:42,641 --> 00:51:44,260
canvas and could target.

787
00:51:44,500 --> 00:51:49,500
The problem I think in the bay area is
the biggest one is one of governance,

788
00:51:51,580 --> 00:51:55,450
right? So you've got all these
different towns and cities,

789
00:51:55,960 --> 00:52:00,960
all of which have their own particular
view about how little development and

790
00:52:02,441 --> 00:52:07,000
usually it is little development
that they actually want.

791
00:52:07,480 --> 00:52:10,330
Um, and um, as a result,

792
00:52:10,331 --> 00:52:15,331
you can't be comprehensive in the
way that you think about it and you,

793
00:52:15,820 --> 00:52:16,300
um,

794
00:52:16,300 --> 00:52:21,300
delegate enormous power over the capacity
to grow and create that supply to

795
00:52:24,010 --> 00:52:28,900
individual governmental units.
And that is sort of the biggest problems.

796
00:52:28,901 --> 00:52:33,901
So I'd say the number one thing that they
could do there is actually figure out

797
00:52:34,571 --> 00:52:38,740
a way it'll never happen.
But regional planning, okay.

798
00:52:39,100 --> 00:52:43,120
This other absent that is,
you know,

799
00:52:43,150 --> 00:52:48,150
each one of those jurisdictions
is Gunna have to become much more,

800
00:52:50,050 --> 00:52:54,310
um, friendly to growing supply. Uh,

801
00:52:54,340 --> 00:52:57,040
but they, you know, the problem is,

802
00:52:57,041 --> 00:53:01,390
is that like the transportation
systems, you know, just keep,

803
00:53:01,720 --> 00:53:05,800
can't keep up. There's no reached
real great planning there either.

804
00:53:06,190 --> 00:53:09,670
And so you can't accommodate the demand.

805
00:53:10,060 --> 00:53:14,470
And so the bay area feels on every
level like a pressure cooker.

806
00:53:14,870 --> 00:53:18,520
Um, and you know, until you
solve the governance issue,

807
00:53:18,820 --> 00:53:23,470
until you actually are able to think
regionally about the things that

808
00:53:23,471 --> 00:53:26,240
accommodate demand,
um,

809
00:53:26,340 --> 00:53:30,240
it's not going to change and it's probably
only gonna get worse until quality of

810
00:53:30,241 --> 00:53:35,241
life declined so much that people aren't
going to want to be there anymore.

811
00:53:36,390 --> 00:53:39,140
Now, you know, some places
are more enlightened. I mean,

812
00:53:39,150 --> 00:53:43,800
look at San Jose for example in
Google's plans for San Jose. You know,

813
00:53:43,890 --> 00:53:48,570
hopefully that will be a little bit of a
release valve for the area. Same thing,

814
00:53:48,571 --> 00:53:51,990
you know, in Sunnyvale and stuff.
But it's, it's a real problem.

815
00:53:52,450 --> 00:53:56,310
Um, this issue is a huge issue for
our employees in the bay area is yes,

816
00:53:56,320 --> 00:53:58,000
you will know we've run out of time,

817
00:53:58,001 --> 00:54:00,010
but we have three people
who have been standing.

818
00:54:00,011 --> 00:54:04,840
So maybe we could have each of you say
where you are from and ask your question

819
00:54:04,841 --> 00:54:05,110
then you can,

820
00:54:05,110 --> 00:54:06,040
yeah, I'll do it. I'll do it.

821
00:54:07,330 --> 00:54:09,830
Creative answers. Go ahead. Yeah. Where
do you live and what's your question?

822
00:54:09,940 --> 00:54:12,370
I live in upper east side and
I grew up in Elmhurst, queens,

823
00:54:12,790 --> 00:54:15,850
dance with the CEO again earlier.
Talk about governance.

824
00:54:15,880 --> 00:54:17,260
And so like if I look at China,

825
00:54:17,290 --> 00:54:20,530
so they have the Beijing
autonomous kind of governance,

826
00:54:20,531 --> 00:54:23,890
the same who Shanghai and the US.
We kind of have that with Washington DC,

827
00:54:24,300 --> 00:54:26,140
you know, in terms of really
innovating in the cities.

828
00:54:26,170 --> 00:54:31,170
Now what if we could push for the u s
recognize certain cities like New York as

829
00:54:31,271 --> 00:54:33,520
its own special economic unit.

830
00:54:33,820 --> 00:54:37,480
That way it could be freed from
upstate New York to actually innovate.

831
00:54:38,040 --> 00:54:39,480
The same is true by the way in Germany.

832
00:54:39,510 --> 00:54:42,810
There are a number of federal states
that are essentially cities. Look,

833
00:54:42,811 --> 00:54:44,310
I think it could be great.

834
00:54:44,400 --> 00:54:48,510
I mean the city also gives a lot more
money to the state than it actually gives

835
00:54:48,511 --> 00:54:49,344
back.

836
00:54:49,380 --> 00:54:54,380
But the one thing that you generally
recognize about governments is they very

837
00:54:57,181 --> 00:55:01,060
rarely, um, devolve power, um,

838
00:55:01,110 --> 00:55:05,610
unless they're desperate. So, you know,
it's, it's great thing to think about,

839
00:55:05,611 --> 00:55:07,890
but better happened. You've
been waiting. Sorry sir.

840
00:55:08,030 --> 00:55:10,070
Uh,
where do you live and what's your

841
00:55:10,510 --> 00:55:11,261
Brooklyn Heights?

842
00:55:11,261 --> 00:55:15,200
I begrudgingly moved to Jersey City
because it was more affordable. Um,

843
00:55:15,280 --> 00:55:16,480
my question is this,

844
00:55:16,510 --> 00:55:20,110
there is a disproportionate amount of
the population concentrated in cities.

845
00:55:20,590 --> 00:55:24,610
Do you think that trend will continue
or will things like autonomous cars,

846
00:55:24,611 --> 00:55:29,230
teleworking or anything of that sort of
caused the influx to reverse basically,

847
00:55:29,231 --> 00:55:32,140
where do you think populations there'll
be concentrated more moving forward?

848
00:55:32,350 --> 00:55:33,070
Um,

849
00:55:33,070 --> 00:55:37,630
well you've already actually starting to
see a little bit of a movement back to

850
00:55:37,840 --> 00:55:42,620
particularly around high
cost urban centers, um,

851
00:55:42,730 --> 00:55:46,150
back to the suburbs or
even excerpts. Uh, so I,

852
00:55:46,151 --> 00:55:50,110
I don't think it's going to be through
this dramatic rush where everyone,

853
00:55:50,111 --> 00:55:52,810
like in America is going
to move into the cities.

854
00:55:52,811 --> 00:55:57,670
I think people want choice and it's
good that they actually have choice.

855
00:55:57,910 --> 00:56:01,840
I think the question that you asked
about things like autonomous cars and

856
00:56:01,841 --> 00:56:04,420
whether that's going to encourage,
um,

857
00:56:04,660 --> 00:56:09,660
city dwelling or it's going to encourage
longer commutes a will to some extent

858
00:56:11,021 --> 00:56:16,021
be a function of the way in which we
incentivize the use of those vehicles.

859
00:56:18,160 --> 00:56:18,581
You know,

860
00:56:18,581 --> 00:56:23,020
are we going to try and actually
discourage having too many cars on the,

861
00:56:23,980 --> 00:56:28,810
are we going to, you know, we
don't know. And so, uh, I don't,

862
00:56:28,811 --> 00:56:32,950
I think it's hard to tell and if you
read all the literature about it, it's,

863
00:56:33,130 --> 00:56:35,110
it's really kinda up in the air.

864
00:56:35,590 --> 00:56:40,590
I'm a believer in cities because I do
believe that for a very high percentage of

865
00:56:41,891 --> 00:56:42,724
people,

866
00:56:42,940 --> 00:56:47,940
they have a real desire for contact and
community that has to be face to face.

867
00:56:51,790 --> 00:56:55,360
Not Everybody views that other people
view having a lot more green space.

868
00:56:55,600 --> 00:56:58,270
I also think that when we
do have autonomous vehicles,

869
00:56:58,271 --> 00:57:02,770
we're going to be able to carve back a
lot more space for open space and make

870
00:57:02,771 --> 00:57:06,340
our cities if we handle
it well, um, more livable.

871
00:57:06,550 --> 00:57:10,270
So I'm a total optimist about cities,
but I don't think they're the only answer.

872
00:57:10,330 --> 00:57:12,100
That's how our final question,
where do you live?

873
00:57:12,300 --> 00:57:12,851
Where's she live?

874
00:57:12,851 --> 00:57:16,810
On the upper west side and I'm actually
also from the suburbs of Detroit.

875
00:57:16,870 --> 00:57:21,380
Where are you from? Oh, that's
further out, right? It's still, yeah.

876
00:57:22,480 --> 00:57:24,760
Um,
my question is that like,

877
00:57:25,150 --> 00:57:29,830
regarding like gentrification,
there's concerns that,

878
00:57:29,831 --> 00:57:30,341
you know,

879
00:57:30,341 --> 00:57:34,300
the people who already lived there are
getting pushed out or that they feel that

880
00:57:34,301 --> 00:57:39,230
they're not really in the community
anymore. Uh, how do you find, uh,

881
00:57:39,320 --> 00:57:44,020
you know, a balance when you're making
these developments that, you know, you're,

882
00:57:44,350 --> 00:57:47,700
you're sparing growth,
but you're also not like excluding

883
00:57:48,220 --> 00:57:51,310
yeah. You don't look,
I actually think, um,

884
00:57:51,700 --> 00:57:54,460
while gentrification or
affordability or related,

885
00:57:54,461 --> 00:57:57,250
they're not completely overlapping.

886
00:57:57,760 --> 00:58:02,650
I generally believe that
gentrification is a good thing.

887
00:58:03,340 --> 00:58:03,820
Um,

888
00:58:03,820 --> 00:58:08,820
and I believe gentrification can
occur with out unduly compromising

889
00:58:10,451 --> 00:58:13,420
affordability.
I believe that for a number of reasons.

890
00:58:13,421 --> 00:58:18,421
One is a very high percentage
of units in this city,

891
00:58:18,851 --> 00:58:20,170
literally like a million,

892
00:58:20,830 --> 00:58:24,810
have some form of rent control on them.
Um,

893
00:58:24,920 --> 00:58:28,480
and that acts as a real,
um,

894
00:58:28,510 --> 00:58:33,190
a buffer against rising prices.
I think though,

895
00:58:33,191 --> 00:58:38,191
the real answer at the end of the day
is to continue to build more housing.

896
00:58:39,460 --> 00:58:43,490
Um, but you know, when you
talk about gentrification, um,

897
00:58:43,510 --> 00:58:45,670
it brings real benefits to that.

898
00:58:45,671 --> 00:58:48,280
People don't talk about the people
who've been there for a long time,

899
00:58:48,281 --> 00:58:51,550
who own their homes or apartments.
They're worth a lot more.

900
00:58:51,551 --> 00:58:53,380
There are many better services.

901
00:58:53,590 --> 00:58:58,120
I think the most important
thing is economic opportunity
in terms of jobs being

902
00:58:58,121 --> 00:59:02,650
created. Um, tend to, um, um,

903
00:59:02,740 --> 00:59:07,120
be greatest in areas that are gentrifying,
which creates opportunity for people.

904
00:59:07,480 --> 00:59:08,370
Um, you know, as,

905
00:59:08,371 --> 00:59:12,190
as I mentioned before in the areas that
we focused on with affordable housing

906
00:59:12,510 --> 00:59:14,860
now in central Brooklyn,

907
00:59:14,861 --> 00:59:18,600
like Bedford Stuyvesant
in the South Bronx, yeah,

908
00:59:18,670 --> 00:59:23,570
in central Harlem where we invested a
huge amount of money to hopefully make

909
00:59:23,571 --> 00:59:26,450
housing markets work,
but most of it was affordable.

910
00:59:26,660 --> 00:59:31,660
We saw a huge increases in job growth
and business production with meaningful

911
00:59:32,601 --> 00:59:37,310
declines in unemployment rates and
there really isn't a ton of evidence to

912
00:59:37,311 --> 00:59:40,250
indicate that people were actually
forced out of their homes. Instead,

913
00:59:40,260 --> 00:59:41,750
what we do is we just created more.

914
00:59:42,310 --> 00:59:46,850
So if you judge the city
I the starting point,

915
00:59:46,880 --> 00:59:49,700
January,
2002 or roughly nine 11,

916
00:59:50,120 --> 00:59:54,020
I think you can see that Dan's
contribution was extraordinary.

917
00:59:54,410 --> 00:59:58,340
His office today is in one
of the buildings that he
helped design and promote.

918
00:59:58,790 --> 00:59:59,180
Right.

919
00:59:59,180 --> 01:00:03,830
And you are a genuine sort of a
Patriot and lover of our city,

920
01:00:04,100 --> 01:00:06,690
so thank you guys so much
for this and his book

921
01:00:07,050 --> 01:00:08,630
greater than ever.
Thank you.

922
01:00:08,910 --> 01:00:13,910
[inaudible] we have books in the back.

923
01:00:17,020 --> 01:00:17,660
Okay, good. Great.
