1
00:00:06,080 --> 00:00:07,410
Help me.
Welcome Morning Neil.

2
00:00:15,460 --> 00:00:17,200
Mona and I are childhood rails.

3
00:00:17,210 --> 00:00:20,980
We've known each other since the last
century and we are actually grown together

4
00:00:20,981 --> 00:00:24,670
ever since. And we've been collaborating
together when we were children,

5
00:00:24,671 --> 00:00:29,671
when we used to talk a lot and we'll
use the like enjoying nature and talking

6
00:00:29,771 --> 00:00:31,270
about other animal species.

7
00:00:31,450 --> 00:00:35,100
And we also like to compare
our perception of reality. Uh,

8
00:00:35,140 --> 00:00:39,840
so we were always talking about uh,
what it would be like 2 cents, uh,

9
00:00:39,910 --> 00:00:40,840
things that we can send,

10
00:00:40,841 --> 00:00:44,680
what it would be like to be an aunt
or what would it be like to be another

11
00:00:44,681 --> 00:00:48,400
species. So we used to talk a lot about
nature more than science fiction or,

12
00:00:48,580 --> 00:00:52,840
or technology. We were more
into nature and other species.

13
00:00:52,841 --> 00:00:56,230
And what we also compared
a lot was vision. Cause I,

14
00:00:56,740 --> 00:01:00,190
I was born completely colorblind so I've
never seen color, I've never seen blue,

15
00:01:00,220 --> 00:01:03,400
yellow, pink. I have acromegaly.
Awesome. Which is total color blindness.

16
00:01:03,700 --> 00:01:05,680
So that's something that was
very different between us,

17
00:01:05,710 --> 00:01:08,620
that I would see things in gray
scale and she would see colors,

18
00:01:08,680 --> 00:01:11,770
she would see things that I wouldn't say.
So we were at the same species.

19
00:01:11,771 --> 00:01:15,970
What we had different
perception of reality to me
seeing in gray scale was fine.

20
00:01:16,040 --> 00:01:19,780
I enjoy seeing in gray scale cause
I see better at night vision.

21
00:01:19,781 --> 00:01:21,940
So at night I would see better than moon,

22
00:01:22,210 --> 00:01:24,190
but during the day she would
say things that I wouldn't see.

23
00:01:24,430 --> 00:01:28,060
Also I see longer distances because if
you don't see color you can see longer.

24
00:01:28,061 --> 00:01:30,700
The senators and I memorized the
shapes more easily because color,

25
00:01:30,710 --> 00:01:33,970
it doesn't distract me but I couldn't
ignore the existence of color because

26
00:01:33,971 --> 00:01:36,300
color has mentioned every single day.
Uh,

27
00:01:36,670 --> 00:01:41,340
like in elements that are things that are
very common like Bluetooth, Greenpeace,

28
00:01:41,380 --> 00:01:45,310
Red Cross, uh, yellow pages,
pink pants, the green card,

29
00:01:45,610 --> 00:01:50,260
James Brown is his last name and also
these huge country called green land as

30
00:01:50,261 --> 00:01:50,860
well.

31
00:01:50,860 --> 00:01:54,460
So I kept hearing the names of colors and
I couldn't ignore the existence of it.

32
00:01:55,030 --> 00:01:58,390
Also when you use a tap water,
like hot water and cold water,

33
00:01:58,391 --> 00:02:01,720
sometimes there's only a color
code or maps, this is fine.

34
00:02:01,721 --> 00:02:06,640
But if I go to Tokyo I can get easily
lost cause some maps only use color codes.

35
00:02:06,820 --> 00:02:08,590
And then when I was at
school learning flags,

36
00:02:08,591 --> 00:02:13,591
I had this situation where three
countries share exactly the same flag.

37
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:16,750
And if someone asks me,
have you seen a man with ginger hair,

38
00:02:16,751 --> 00:02:20,040
blue eyes and dressed in pink, I
would have absolutely no idea. I've,

39
00:02:20,041 --> 00:02:21,910
I've seen this man because
the only information I get,

40
00:02:21,911 --> 00:02:25,480
here's the demand has hair that he
has eyes and that he's not naked.

41
00:02:25,750 --> 00:02:30,700
So the reason why I wanted to sense color
was not because of the beauty of color,

42
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:36,070
but because of the social aspect
of it that it's common use. Very,

43
00:02:36,071 --> 00:02:36,904
very used.

44
00:02:37,150 --> 00:02:40,870
I decided I would study music cause I
thought music will not have color and I

45
00:02:40,871 --> 00:02:43,960
wanted to focus my life on the
piano of black and white instrument.

46
00:02:44,050 --> 00:02:46,360
I thought that will be
a black and white world.

47
00:02:46,361 --> 00:02:50,200
But when I was playing music I realized
there's many theories really then

48
00:02:50,201 --> 00:02:51,850
coloring and sound as well.

49
00:02:51,910 --> 00:02:55,810
Newton did this theory centuries ago
and after him there's been many more.

50
00:02:56,290 --> 00:02:59,410
There's many theories that relate
color with sound and actually true.

51
00:02:59,411 --> 00:03:03,850
They both frequency colors or light
frequency and stone is an audio frequency.

52
00:03:03,880 --> 00:03:07,240
So in 2003 when I was
telling music composition,

53
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:11,410
I started the project with Alan Mountain
done in order to create a third eye

54
00:03:11,411 --> 00:03:13,930
that would allow me to hear the
actual frequencies of light.

55
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:18,960
So if we had some kind of third eye that
would allow us to sense the vibrations

56
00:03:19,541 --> 00:03:22,240
of color, but instead of
seeing that we would hear them,

57
00:03:22,540 --> 00:03:24,910
we would hear a note for each color.
Because red for example,

58
00:03:24,911 --> 00:03:29,290
is around 430 millions of millions of
waves per second. So that's a note,

59
00:03:29,320 --> 00:03:32,380
a musical note that we can't hear because
it's too high and it's a different

60
00:03:32,381 --> 00:03:33,101
type of frequency.

61
00:03:33,101 --> 00:03:36,970
But if we could hear that frequency
would hear a note betweenF and f sharp.

62
00:03:36,971 --> 00:03:40,870
So the aim was to create a software that
would scale down the light frequencies

63
00:03:40,871 --> 00:03:43,460
to audible frequencies to that
I would be able to hear colors.

64
00:03:43,461 --> 00:03:47,650
So the first prototype was a webcam
connected the five killer computer and a

65
00:03:47,651 --> 00:03:51,250
pair of headphones that was scaling
down the frequencies of light to audible

66
00:03:51,251 --> 00:03:51,791
frequencies.

67
00:03:51,791 --> 00:03:55,510
So I was able to hear a note for each
color and I memorize the names that you

68
00:03:55,511 --> 00:03:56,380
give to each color.

69
00:03:56,650 --> 00:04:00,070
And I had this for several months until
I memorized all in the visual colors.

70
00:04:00,310 --> 00:04:03,250
And this allowed me to hear a note
for each degree of the color wheel.

71
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:08,240
That's 360 microphones in
an awkward [inaudible] sine
waves. So very pure waves.

72
00:04:08,920 --> 00:04:13,220
Now we here in shades of orange
going up two shades of orange,

73
00:04:13,221 --> 00:04:16,760
yellow and the yellow. So
it's very, very micro Dono.

74
00:04:17,420 --> 00:04:21,110
It took me three years to memorize all
of these microphones and the names that

75
00:04:21,170 --> 00:04:23,590
you would give to all these colors.
And then there's,

76
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:26,620
I'll call it also has another
or thing which is saturation.

77
00:04:26,621 --> 00:04:30,680
So we have the different
levels of saturation depending
on the saturation level.

78
00:04:30,690 --> 00:04:33,850
So it's very loud. It means it's
very saturated and if it's a low,

79
00:04:34,060 --> 00:04:38,230
it's a soft color. And then, um, I was,
uh, I didn't play the piano anymore.

80
00:04:38,231 --> 00:04:42,130
I started painting pianos cause to me
color became my musical instruments.

81
00:04:42,131 --> 00:04:44,460
So I was painting colors
on top of the piano.

82
00:04:44,470 --> 00:04:47,140
Now I was amplifying the sound
of the colors to the audience.

83
00:04:47,141 --> 00:04:48,760
And that was piano concerts.

84
00:04:49,060 --> 00:04:53,260
And my final music composition
of portfolio was not a
score but the different

85
00:04:53,261 --> 00:04:55,810
paintings.
So to me each color is a note.

86
00:04:56,020 --> 00:04:59,980
So I can compose music by
painting different colors
on us on a piece of paper.

87
00:05:00,220 --> 00:05:02,260
When I was able to sense
all the visual colors,

88
00:05:02,261 --> 00:05:04,980
I didn't see why I should stop there
cause there's many other species because

89
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:08,140
inside science scholars that we can not
sense like infrared and ultraviolet.

90
00:05:08,141 --> 00:05:13,141
So in 2007 2008 I decided to extend my
perception of color to near infrared,

91
00:05:13,461 --> 00:05:14,550
the near ultraviolet.

92
00:05:14,770 --> 00:05:17,410
So since then I can send some more
colors in the visual spectrum.

93
00:05:17,650 --> 00:05:21,040
And this means that I can continuously
extend my perception of color beyond the

94
00:05:21,041 --> 00:05:24,860
visual spectrum cause through sound you
can hear much more than through the ice.

95
00:05:24,861 --> 00:05:29,650
So that allows me to perceive colors
that are not only visible to me but

96
00:05:29,651 --> 00:05:31,180
invisible to other humans.

97
00:05:31,390 --> 00:05:36,390
But they're visible for other
or perceptive perceptive
for other animal species.

98
00:05:36,431 --> 00:05:39,400
The Mr continuously extend
the perception of color.

99
00:05:39,430 --> 00:05:44,200
The other aim was not to use or where
technology I went through to become

100
00:05:44,201 --> 00:05:46,630
technology.
I didn't want to have a wearable device.

101
00:05:46,631 --> 00:05:49,000
I wanted to have a new
sensory organ first.

102
00:05:49,001 --> 00:05:51,760
I've thought of having a third eye
implanted in the middle of my head,

103
00:05:51,790 --> 00:05:55,180
but that would only limit my perception
of color to what is in front of me.

104
00:05:55,181 --> 00:05:58,920
So then I looked at nature and I saw
there's many species that have antenna.

105
00:05:58,921 --> 00:06:02,420
So I thought that the best option would
have would be to have a new sensory

106
00:06:02,421 --> 00:06:02,720
organ,

107
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:07,340
an antenna implanted in my head that
would allow me to perceive colors through

108
00:06:07,341 --> 00:06:11,960
vibrations in my bone instead of using
my ears vibrations inside my bone,

109
00:06:11,961 --> 00:06:14,870
that then would become
sounds to my inner ear.

110
00:06:14,930 --> 00:06:18,830
So I looked at nature.
So there's many types of antennas.

111
00:06:19,070 --> 00:06:21,830
The one I was more interested in was
the same fascist type of antenna,

112
00:06:22,370 --> 00:06:23,091
more circular.

113
00:06:23,091 --> 00:06:27,170
So it would allow me to send scholars
360 degrees because I couldn't turn the

114
00:06:27,171 --> 00:06:30,920
antenna around so I can send scholars
behind me or beside me without being

115
00:06:31,220 --> 00:06:34,050
connected to my site.
And then when the antenna was design,

116
00:06:34,051 --> 00:06:38,090
I looked and tried to find a doctor
willing to do the surgery and I said,

117
00:06:38,530 --> 00:06:42,950
[inaudible] is an antenna implant as
such, sorry, we don't do this here.

118
00:06:42,951 --> 00:06:47,000
Within the antenna implants, you'll
have to talk to a bioethical committee.

119
00:06:47,060 --> 00:06:50,840
So I propose the surgery to a biosimilar
committee and then they said no,

120
00:06:50,841 --> 00:06:55,430
that this is not ethical
because a doctor's only
regenerate preexisting sensors

121
00:06:55,460 --> 00:06:57,770
or they regenerate preexisting body parts,

122
00:06:57,771 --> 00:07:02,000
but creating a new sense of color that
goes beyond the spectrum was not ethical.

123
00:07:02,330 --> 00:07:04,310
And also having a new
Oregon was not ethical.

124
00:07:04,311 --> 00:07:08,240
So I tried to find a doctor willing to
do the surgery anonymously and I found

125
00:07:08,241 --> 00:07:10,880
one and then we did it on a Monday,
his day off.

126
00:07:10,910 --> 00:07:14,090
And then we rented the room
and he did the surgery there.

127
00:07:14,150 --> 00:07:17,930
So that's my head facing down.
We reduce, we removed some hair,

128
00:07:18,190 --> 00:07:22,490
we reduced the skin and my head was
drilled four times different implants.

129
00:07:22,760 --> 00:07:26,570
One is for the chip that vibrates
inside my head to other implants or the

130
00:07:26,600 --> 00:07:29,810
structure of the antenna and we
decided to add a fourth implant,

131
00:07:29,811 --> 00:07:33,740
which is Internet connection so that I
can then receive colors from other parts

132
00:07:33,741 --> 00:07:37,640
of the world. Not only the antenna, but
people can also send colors to my head,

133
00:07:37,641 --> 00:07:39,800
arcane connect to external devices.

134
00:07:40,190 --> 00:07:43,490
So it took two months for the
antenna in my head to merge.

135
00:07:43,491 --> 00:07:48,310
So now the angina is part of my skeleton,
so if someone pulls down there,

136
00:07:48,311 --> 00:07:52,310
it's impossible to remove it because
it's inside my bone and I had to get used

137
00:07:52,311 --> 00:07:56,810
to my new height. I'm officially
taller now, Internet connection.

138
00:07:56,811 --> 00:07:59,870
I have five people in the world that
have permission to send colors through my

139
00:07:59,871 --> 00:08:03,740
head. They can do it through their mobile
phones so they can stream live images

140
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:04,700
directly to my head.

141
00:08:04,701 --> 00:08:08,360
So if there's a beautiful sunset in
Australia now someone in Melbourne can

142
00:08:08,361 --> 00:08:11,990
actually use the mobile phone to stream
the live images of the sunset to my head.

143
00:08:11,991 --> 00:08:12,741
So I could be here,

144
00:08:12,741 --> 00:08:16,820
but sensing the colors of a sunset or
if someone sends me colors at night,

145
00:08:16,821 --> 00:08:18,680
then they can actually
influence my dreams.

146
00:08:18,681 --> 00:08:22,700
So if I wake up and I realized I dreamt
the violet people and violent houses,

147
00:08:22,910 --> 00:08:26,660
it's probably because someone was
sending me violet colors at night so my

148
00:08:26,661 --> 00:08:30,200
friends can actually color my dreams or
they can change the way I drink because

149
00:08:30,201 --> 00:08:33,650
of the college they sentence.
So we using the internet as a sense here.

150
00:08:33,650 --> 00:08:37,620
So the Internet is not being used as a
tool or a communication tool is more of a

151
00:08:37,880 --> 00:08:41,270
way of sharing a sense in this case,
sharing color perception.

152
00:08:41,540 --> 00:08:44,870
And also it's a way of extending
my senses beyond my body.

153
00:08:45,950 --> 00:08:49,680
My brain has changed as an Mri of my
brain. Doctors cannot tell what, uh,

154
00:08:49,720 --> 00:08:51,530
what is happening to my rent.

155
00:08:51,531 --> 00:08:54,800
They don't know if I'm looking at an
image or hearing a sound cause my brain

156
00:08:54,810 --> 00:08:56,220
reacts in the same way.

157
00:08:56,460 --> 00:09:00,180
Both the visual and the audio
cortex are always active.

158
00:09:00,660 --> 00:09:04,810
So I feel I'm a cyborg cause I feel that
there's no wall between the sophomore

159
00:09:04,811 --> 00:09:05,311
and my brain.

160
00:09:05,311 --> 00:09:09,540
I felt my brain and the software have
United and given me this new sense.

161
00:09:09,840 --> 00:09:11,370
So I identify as a Cyborg,

162
00:09:11,371 --> 00:09:14,520
as a biological cyborg cause
I feel United to cybernetics.

163
00:09:14,521 --> 00:09:17,130
Cyborg comes from the union
between cybernetics and organism.

164
00:09:17,490 --> 00:09:20,280
And that's why I tried to explain
to the Yukon government in 2004,

165
00:09:20,281 --> 00:09:22,890
because they didn't allow me to renew
my passport because they said that there

166
00:09:22,891 --> 00:09:25,230
was some kind of electronic
equipment or the picture.

167
00:09:25,560 --> 00:09:28,440
And as this law that says electronic
agreement does not allow them passport

168
00:09:28,441 --> 00:09:31,020
photos.
So I told them that this is a body part.

169
00:09:31,021 --> 00:09:33,330
And then I told them that
I felt that I was a Cyborg,

170
00:09:33,340 --> 00:09:35,850
a union between cybernetics
and an organism.

171
00:09:35,851 --> 00:09:39,600
And in the end they allowed me the
appear and the password is 2004 with this

172
00:09:39,630 --> 00:09:43,770
first prototype. And this allows me
to travel freely around the world.

173
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:45,790
Cause airports don't
usually like technology.

174
00:09:45,791 --> 00:09:50,690
So if you are technology they don't like
you very much. So this is part of um, uh,

175
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,920
uh,
important to have it in the passport.

176
00:09:52,921 --> 00:09:56,730
Now I'm applying for Swedish citizenship
because of the material in my head is

177
00:09:56,731 --> 00:10:00,390
Swedish.
So my body parts of my body is Swedish.

178
00:10:00,630 --> 00:10:02,270
So I'm telling them that,
uh,

179
00:10:02,400 --> 00:10:04,920
I should also be allowed to
apply for Swedish citizenship.

180
00:10:05,250 --> 00:10:08,190
So I'm still in conversations
with the Swedish government.

181
00:10:08,520 --> 00:10:11,640
Hopefully they'll say yes,
and if they see as,

182
00:10:11,641 --> 00:10:15,390
I guess each country might have different
laws saying that if you have a body

183
00:10:15,391 --> 00:10:17,310
part that is from the UK,

184
00:10:17,520 --> 00:10:20,430
maybe you need to have it for seven
years and then after seven years you can

185
00:10:20,431 --> 00:10:21,920
apply for British citizenship.

186
00:10:21,930 --> 00:10:25,980
We've had the body part that is British
and maybe the u s might be longer,

187
00:10:25,981 --> 00:10:30,630
maybe 10. I don't know.
We'll see. So hopefully we'll
have, I'll have a reply soon.

188
00:10:32,500 --> 00:10:36,970
Yeah. So I, as I grew
up with Neil, I could,

189
00:10:37,420 --> 00:10:41,630
uh, go with Cayman experience all his
developments and there was appointed,

190
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:44,770
he was actually better
in perceiving the nine,

191
00:10:44,771 --> 00:10:46,810
so he extent the precession of color.

192
00:10:46,811 --> 00:10:50,890
So I kind of got jealous and I wondered
also to extend my perception of

193
00:10:50,891 --> 00:10:54,220
something. And I was studying
dance and I'm a choreographer,

194
00:10:54,221 --> 00:10:55,750
so I'm very interested in movement.

195
00:10:55,800 --> 00:10:58,960
I in and I wanted to perceive
movement in a deeper way.

196
00:10:59,160 --> 00:11:03,770
And I knew that using technology to do
that would help me because of that. So I,

197
00:11:03,780 --> 00:11:07,150
I thought, what, how
could I perceive movement?

198
00:11:07,151 --> 00:11:10,810
Like what sense of movement can
we have as that humans don't have?

199
00:11:11,110 --> 00:11:14,140
And the first thing is, I thought
this was that, um, we can,

200
00:11:14,170 --> 00:11:17,350
we don't have the sense
of a speed by ourselves.

201
00:11:17,380 --> 00:11:20,710
So I use this, uh, I mean like, uh,

202
00:11:20,860 --> 00:11:25,540
this kind of glove and I would point of
people. And then when people were, uh,

203
00:11:25,541 --> 00:11:27,340
were walking in front of the glove,

204
00:11:27,370 --> 00:11:31,700
I could know the speed of the people
walking in front of me and then, um,

205
00:11:31,701 --> 00:11:35,120
was not that useful because I had
to point and people, and then, uh,

206
00:11:35,121 --> 00:11:38,950
that gave me any information and I
didn't want to have inflammation.

207
00:11:38,951 --> 00:11:42,840
I wanted to have a sense, like
a feeling of speed. So, uh,

208
00:11:42,850 --> 00:11:45,910
the next step was to grow the tens,
phone these into any rings.

209
00:11:46,180 --> 00:11:48,880
So every time that someone
was walking from right,

210
00:11:48,881 --> 00:11:52,810
the lever would feel a regression on
my right ear. And then on my left here,

211
00:11:53,050 --> 00:11:56,860
and then depending of the vibration
of the interval of each way ration,

212
00:11:57,040 --> 00:12:01,210
I wouldn't know the spate of the people
walking in front of me. So then I would,

213
00:12:01,300 --> 00:12:02,200
uh,
if I,

214
00:12:02,400 --> 00:12:05,950
I had these for a long time and then
with my ass clothes it would be able to

215
00:12:05,951 --> 00:12:10,450
know and what, um, uh, what speed the
people was walking in front of me.

216
00:12:10,750 --> 00:12:13,150
So it was like a sense
and then I'd be aeration.

217
00:12:13,660 --> 00:12:18,070
And then after wearing these for some,
some time, like just focusing on the,

218
00:12:18,430 --> 00:12:19,950
on the speed,
the hat in front,

219
00:12:19,960 --> 00:12:23,830
one day I realized that maybe it could
turn the yearnings around and then these

220
00:12:23,831 --> 00:12:28,720
open a whole, um, a whole space
awareness of myself. So suddenly,

221
00:12:28,930 --> 00:12:32,260
because I could already see movement
with my eyes in front of me,

222
00:12:32,261 --> 00:12:36,370
but in the back of our body that
I feel that our sense is a very,

223
00:12:36,700 --> 00:12:40,300
we don't have many senses.
It's like very close sensory,

224
00:12:40,330 --> 00:12:42,070
but the bags of our bodies.

225
00:12:42,250 --> 00:12:46,540
So these open a whole space and
I could feel presence behind me.

226
00:12:46,541 --> 00:12:51,240
So every time someone was working was
working towards me, I could feel presence.

227
00:12:51,241 --> 00:12:54,520
Who would they be relations,
uh, on my years then I'm,

228
00:12:55,090 --> 00:12:58,030
I was perceiving these
movement all around me through,

229
00:12:58,060 --> 00:13:02,680
through the probation to the people and
objects. And there was a point that, um,

230
00:13:03,060 --> 00:13:05,290
I, I don't want that. The,

231
00:13:05,291 --> 00:13:09,010
my movement perception depends
on people or objects around me.

232
00:13:09,340 --> 00:13:13,960
So I thought that I needed to perceive
from movement and live with me more

233
00:13:13,970 --> 00:13:18,970
universal that didn't come from people
or objects that I could be alone in the

234
00:13:19,031 --> 00:13:20,740
Bryant and you still feel movement.

235
00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:23,510
And then I realized that
not only humans move,

236
00:13:23,511 --> 00:13:27,340
there are many things and move all
around us and in many different ways.

237
00:13:27,580 --> 00:13:32,170
And the planet itself is constantly
moving and not only rotates by itself and

238
00:13:32,171 --> 00:13:33,970
around the, and the sand, but it,

239
00:13:34,030 --> 00:13:37,870
it moves constantly and shakes
constantly through earthquakes.

240
00:13:38,200 --> 00:13:41,980
And earthquake is a massive movement
that most of the times we don't feel it.

241
00:13:42,340 --> 00:13:46,300
And I thought it would be fascinated to
transforms to them's from this massive

242
00:13:46,301 --> 00:13:48,310
movement to,
to one body.

243
00:13:48,730 --> 00:13:53,590
And so now I thought that
it could perceive the
earthquakes of the year through

244
00:13:53,591 --> 00:13:57,760
my body. And then now I have, uh,
an implant in my arm. The Bib rates,

245
00:13:57,761 --> 00:14:00,010
every time there's an earthquake
anywhere in the planet.

246
00:14:00,190 --> 00:14:03,280
So depending of the intensity
of earthquake there, we ration,

247
00:14:03,281 --> 00:14:08,230
I feel in my arm is a stronger, uh, lower,
and I call these the size. Makes Sense.

248
00:14:09,130 --> 00:14:12,760
Um, yes. Uh, that will be,

249
00:14:13,030 --> 00:14:16,720
and then the,
and then when we do like,

250
00:14:16,721 --> 00:14:20,620
we see these Neil distension of the
news Nealon diversities as an art.

251
00:14:20,830 --> 00:14:22,060
So the,

252
00:14:22,120 --> 00:14:26,920
the artwork of a cyborg artist would
be the creation of a new sense. Um,

253
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:31,660
the, so my artwork would be the seismic
sense and meals are what would be the

254
00:14:31,970 --> 00:14:35,530
internet per se, this new sense that
he goes to sooner dramatic sense,

255
00:14:35,740 --> 00:14:38,560
but it's a sense of what
happens inside our own body.

256
00:14:38,740 --> 00:14:41,680
So we are the only
audience of our own art.

257
00:14:42,190 --> 00:14:45,910
So in order to share our experience,
we create external artwork.

258
00:14:47,200 --> 00:14:49,680
Um, yeah, there's always
external. How rude,

259
00:14:49,690 --> 00:14:51,980
like the reveals our
experience of reality. So

260
00:14:51,980 --> 00:14:55,280
cyborg art is like taking a picture.
When you take a picture,

261
00:14:55,560 --> 00:14:57,800
the art of taking a picture is one thing.

262
00:14:57,801 --> 00:15:02,090
And then the art of developing the film
is that another part you can either just

263
00:15:02,091 --> 00:15:05,420
take the picture and that could be art
that only experience the photographer.

264
00:15:05,660 --> 00:15:10,550
Or you can choose to develop this
film and share this with other people.

265
00:15:10,551 --> 00:15:14,630
So in the case of Cyborg art, it's the
same. We are experiencing our own art,

266
00:15:14,631 --> 00:15:16,580
which is the experience of this new sense.

267
00:15:16,760 --> 00:15:20,480
And then we decide to reveal these
experience through external odd words.

268
00:15:20,510 --> 00:15:22,520
Or by the way we,

269
00:15:22,540 --> 00:15:26,960
we live also mean my case before I would
dress in a way that it would look good.

270
00:15:26,961 --> 00:15:28,730
Now I dress in a way that
it sounds good to me.

271
00:15:28,731 --> 00:15:33,100
So I decide which notes I want to wear.
If I wear this color combination, I,

272
00:15:33,101 --> 00:15:36,600
I'm dressed in c major, so I,
I'm, I'm wearing a major chord.

273
00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:40,040
So I would dress like this in happy
occasions. This is a minor chord.

274
00:15:40,070 --> 00:15:41,660
I would dress like this,
didn't funerals.

275
00:15:41,661 --> 00:15:45,010
So that's a a sad court
or I can also wear songs.

276
00:15:45,011 --> 00:15:48,560
So I'm designing clothes with a friend
so that can wear specific melodies.

277
00:15:48,561 --> 00:15:50,630
This is a tie that sounds
like electronic music.

278
00:15:50,631 --> 00:15:54,110
So I really liked a piece of electronic
music. The tie, if I listened to it,

279
00:15:54,650 --> 00:15:57,680
I hear the electronic music.
So the longer the title longer the melody,

280
00:15:57,860 --> 00:16:01,060
you can choose how long you
wanted. Also, the way I,

281
00:16:01,061 --> 00:16:04,580
I see houses has changed now.
My living room for example,

282
00:16:04,581 --> 00:16:08,750
is painted in c major,
pink, blue and yellow.

283
00:16:08,780 --> 00:16:10,820
So then when I go inside,
it's major chord.

284
00:16:10,821 --> 00:16:13,370
The floor is all red because
red is the lowest frequency.

285
00:16:13,520 --> 00:16:17,180
So it's the lowest sound. So it gives
a profound sound to the whole house.

286
00:16:17,480 --> 00:16:20,440
Then the exit door is, um, is um,

287
00:16:20,930 --> 00:16:23,860
green because green is in the middle
of the spectrum. So it gives a,

288
00:16:23,861 --> 00:16:26,240
it's like a tuning fork
before you go outside.

289
00:16:26,360 --> 00:16:28,310
The ceilings are black and
white because it's silent.

290
00:16:28,311 --> 00:16:30,750
So if I lie down and it's all silent,
uh,

291
00:16:30,990 --> 00:16:34,880
then the kitchen is a, I'm not,
my bedroom has three colors.

292
00:16:34,881 --> 00:16:36,020
It's a turquoise,

293
00:16:36,590 --> 00:16:41,450
pink and violet.
So it's the notes are beat,

294
00:16:41,660 --> 00:16:43,460
eat and the bat.

295
00:16:43,490 --> 00:16:47,270
So it makes sense for me to happen
these three colors in the bedroom.

296
00:16:47,540 --> 00:16:50,630
And then in the, in the kitchen it's
violet. Violet is the highest page,

297
00:16:50,631 --> 00:16:54,440
so it gives, it's uh, keeps me alert. So
it's a color that we don't usually eat.

298
00:16:54,500 --> 00:16:56,840
So it doesn't interfere with food.

299
00:16:57,380 --> 00:17:00,320
Food has changed a lot as well because
when I eat, I hear different notes.

300
00:17:00,321 --> 00:17:03,500
So I can actually compose music with foot
depending on how I put the food on the

301
00:17:03,501 --> 00:17:04,070
plate.

302
00:17:04,070 --> 00:17:08,120
I can eat songs and I'm collaborating
with a restaurant in Barcelona where we

303
00:17:08,121 --> 00:17:12,140
are, uh, there's a, a new
plate, uh, chroma phone.

304
00:17:12,141 --> 00:17:15,650
Why you put the food on top and then you
rotate the plate and then you can hear

305
00:17:15,710 --> 00:17:18,560
the foot. So you can go to the
restaurant and asked for some music.

306
00:17:18,770 --> 00:17:21,770
You're going to ask for Mozart and then
they serve you the different colors.

307
00:17:21,771 --> 00:17:23,630
And then you turn around
and you hear Mozart piece.

308
00:17:23,631 --> 00:17:27,500
Or you can ask for some lady Gaga Dessert
and then you can hear some lady Gaga

309
00:17:27,500 --> 00:17:28,690
Dessert. So, uh,

310
00:17:28,730 --> 00:17:32,240
this was actually presented the three
days ago in San Francisco and we're doing

311
00:17:32,241 --> 00:17:36,650
some experimental Sonequa romantic
dinners where people eat different songs.

312
00:17:36,890 --> 00:17:39,410
So now I can compose music
as well by looking at things.

313
00:17:39,411 --> 00:17:40,460
Instead of playing an instrument,

314
00:17:40,461 --> 00:17:44,300
I can just look at different colors
and then I hear the music in my head.

315
00:17:44,330 --> 00:17:47,570
And then I can choose to also share this
experience by amplifying the sounds of

316
00:17:47,571 --> 00:17:50,190
my head to the audience.
So then the color countries,

317
00:17:50,790 --> 00:17:54,750
I use bone bone conducted headphones or
Bluetooth to amplify the sounds of my

318
00:17:54,751 --> 00:17:58,890
head to the audience. And then I can play
different types of food. Are Objects.

319
00:17:58,920 --> 00:18:01,770
Also my experience of walking around the
supermarket has changed a lot because

320
00:18:01,771 --> 00:18:04,170
there's lots of colors there.
So there's lots of music,

321
00:18:04,171 --> 00:18:07,560
especially the aisles with cleaning
products. And that is the most exciting.

322
00:18:07,590 --> 00:18:09,720
I love a supermarket because it has very,

323
00:18:09,721 --> 00:18:14,180
very loud and unexpected colors
and it's usually very poppy, uh,

324
00:18:14,300 --> 00:18:18,500
pop music. Their milk is silent.

325
00:18:18,710 --> 00:18:22,100
So what elements and black alums?
I completely silent.

326
00:18:22,370 --> 00:18:26,050
It's not only supermarkets is also
art now going listen to a Picasso.

327
00:18:26,060 --> 00:18:28,950
I can listen to an Andy Warhol.
All painters have become composers.

328
00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:32,930
So my experience of walking around
the moment is like a music experience.

329
00:18:32,930 --> 00:18:36,550
I can listen to different melodies
and also each composer oil.

330
00:18:36,551 --> 00:18:39,500
Each painters sounds different. I
can hear the scream. For example,

331
00:18:39,950 --> 00:18:42,920
an Andy Warhol for example, sounds
very loud cause it's very saturated.

332
00:18:42,921 --> 00:18:46,700
So you can hear an Andy Warhol from the
other end of the museum usually because

333
00:18:46,701 --> 00:18:47,421
it's very loud.

334
00:18:47,421 --> 00:18:50,650
Whereas all the pain things sound less
because they're less has saturated.

335
00:18:50,651 --> 00:18:53,620
The way I send people as well has
changed because when I look at someone,

336
00:18:53,650 --> 00:18:57,070
I hear their face and what I like
doing is instead of drying their face,

337
00:18:57,071 --> 00:19:00,070
I write down the notes of people's faces,
like the sound of the eyes,

338
00:19:00,071 --> 00:19:03,010
the lips of the skin, the hair, and then
I send them an MP three of their face.

339
00:19:03,280 --> 00:19:05,840
So they thinking like I'm hearing those
now. The first one was [inaudible].

340
00:19:06,150 --> 00:19:09,520
I asked Prince Charles if I could listen
to his face and this was his reaction

341
00:19:09,521 --> 00:19:12,640
when I asked him. Each
person. It sounds different.

342
00:19:12,641 --> 00:19:17,520
Judi Dench has silent hair like a glass
of milk, so she has this very silent, uh,

343
00:19:17,780 --> 00:19:18,300
uh,

344
00:19:18,300 --> 00:19:22,840
James Cameron has very loud
skin high-pitch shade of skin.

345
00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:26,200
Al Gore has different notes in his eyes,
different shades of Turquoise.

346
00:19:26,440 --> 00:19:31,090
So different nodes in each
eye. Tim Berners Lee has a
very odd sound of eyelid,

347
00:19:31,290 --> 00:19:35,240
so his eyelids sound very unusual.
Marina Abramovic is very silent, uh,

348
00:19:35,260 --> 00:19:40,150
almost a silent all her,
but the lips are very loud and very low.

349
00:19:40,910 --> 00:19:45,310
Uh, Steve Wozniak, Zeiss, I'm like
green apples. So very bureau as well.

350
00:19:45,340 --> 00:19:49,210
Moby sounds very little. She
is one note missing. No hair.

351
00:19:49,211 --> 00:19:52,540
So he has less knowledge than
other people. We're the island.

352
00:19:52,541 --> 00:19:56,350
Sounded like an old painting. Very
unsaturated. Metallica lugging, see major,

353
00:19:56,351 --> 00:19:57,090
a major chord.

354
00:19:57,090 --> 00:20:00,330
It's unusual to find major courts
where the Phillip glass sounds very

355
00:20:00,350 --> 00:20:04,990
[inaudible], very similar to his music
and Bono at very, very loud glasses.

356
00:20:04,990 --> 00:20:09,610
In this case he's got his where violet
and very saturated. If you wear makeup,

357
00:20:09,611 --> 00:20:13,420
then you sound very different. Uh,
if, if you went to hear your face,

358
00:20:13,450 --> 00:20:15,520
you would not use red lipstick,

359
00:20:15,521 --> 00:20:18,460
you would use green lipstick because
the sound of green sounds very good with

360
00:20:18,461 --> 00:20:21,250
the skin. So, uh, if we would hear color,

361
00:20:21,490 --> 00:20:25,300
most people would wear green
lipstick and then some blue here.

362
00:20:25,301 --> 00:20:30,250
Cause then it sounds see major or you
have f sharp major in the face that you

363
00:20:30,251 --> 00:20:31,150
didn't like it.
No.

364
00:20:31,570 --> 00:20:34,420
And then what really surprises me is
that people who say they're black,

365
00:20:34,421 --> 00:20:36,790
they're not black. And people who
say they're white, they're not white,

366
00:20:36,791 --> 00:20:39,010
people will say they're black,
they're very, very dark orange.

367
00:20:39,490 --> 00:20:41,740
And they book will say that why
they are very, very light orange.

368
00:20:41,741 --> 00:20:43,690
So the fact that people say
that humans are black and white,

369
00:20:43,691 --> 00:20:47,020
it is completely false. We are all
different shades of orange, very,

370
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:48,610
ours are very dark orange.

371
00:20:48,940 --> 00:20:52,900
This is a color wheel and there's a
reddish orange or yellowish orange.

372
00:20:52,901 --> 00:20:53,660
And then there's different

373
00:20:53,660 --> 00:20:54,710
shades of light.

374
00:20:55,100 --> 00:20:58,880
I can also do face concerts where
instead of playing the objects of colors,

375
00:20:58,881 --> 00:21:02,120
I played the audience's colors.
So I, I look at the faces.

376
00:21:02,210 --> 00:21:05,810
The audience is the onion skews in that
and start creating rhythms with the

377
00:21:05,811 --> 00:21:08,600
sound of the eyes, the hair,
the lips of the audience.

378
00:21:08,990 --> 00:21:12,380
And I create layers of sound.
So it's electronic music created by,

379
00:21:13,220 --> 00:21:16,310
by the colors of the others.
If the concert sounds really bad,

380
00:21:16,370 --> 00:21:19,310
it's their fault because that's
where the music comes from.

381
00:21:21,370 --> 00:21:25,150
Uh, the last face concert was of
Prince Albert, the second of Monaco.

382
00:21:25,180 --> 00:21:28,690
He liked the sound of his face so much
that he's using it as his ringtone.

383
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:31,630
So when people call him,
here's his face.

384
00:21:33,040 --> 00:21:36,880
The secondary effect of hearing
colors that sounds also become colors.

385
00:21:36,881 --> 00:21:41,770
So if I hear the line, uh, telephone line
for me is green. Mostly it creates the,

386
00:21:41,810 --> 00:21:44,800
the frequency of green.
And I can also play music.

387
00:21:44,801 --> 00:21:48,250
This is Mozart's queen of the night.
Note by note from the center to the end.

388
00:21:48,610 --> 00:21:49,720
This is also music,

389
00:21:49,721 --> 00:21:52,900
this baby baby by Justin Bieber
from the first book to the last.

390
00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:55,300
Also when we speak,
use different frequencies.

391
00:21:55,301 --> 00:21:58,150
So I can transpose speeches into color.

392
00:21:58,360 --> 00:22:01,090
One of them is Martin Luther
King's I have a dream speech.

393
00:22:01,091 --> 00:22:03,040
And the other one is a speech by Hitler.

394
00:22:03,070 --> 00:22:05,980
They look very different because they
used very different types of frequencies

395
00:22:05,981 --> 00:22:10,030
when they spoke.
Also colors I use now with musicians.

396
00:22:10,031 --> 00:22:13,840
So music has learned the sound of color
and then they have the concert colors

397
00:22:13,841 --> 00:22:15,840
are projected on stage
and that's the score.

398
00:22:15,841 --> 00:22:20,260
So they play the colors of that
projected in the, on the, on the stage.

399
00:22:20,290 --> 00:22:24,250
And also there's a public sculptures that
use the sauna chromatic scale as well.

400
00:22:24,251 --> 00:22:25,084
So in this case,

401
00:22:25,360 --> 00:22:29,020
this is a song you can download an app
on your mobile phone and then you walk

402
00:22:29,230 --> 00:22:31,690
underneath the sculpture and
then you can listen to a melody.

403
00:22:32,290 --> 00:22:33,640
And at night it changes color.

404
00:22:33,641 --> 00:22:37,210
So you can actually hear music by
pointing your phone at the sculpture that

405
00:22:37,211 --> 00:22:39,590
keeps changing colors.
Uh,

406
00:22:39,610 --> 00:22:43,810
the reaction that people I've had with
people through the years has changed.

407
00:22:43,830 --> 00:22:48,550
I've the fact of having an Antinomians
people stop me everyday since 2004 and

408
00:22:48,551 --> 00:22:51,710
they asked me what it is or they,
they just laugh and they leave. Uh,

409
00:22:51,940 --> 00:22:53,920
the thing is that it's changing.
In 2004,

410
00:22:53,921 --> 00:22:57,190
many people thought it was a reading
light that I had some kind of uh,

411
00:22:57,210 --> 00:22:59,950
that it would turn on and they asked me,
can you turn the light on?

412
00:22:59,951 --> 00:23:03,180
And it's not the light. So they thought
it was a reading light in 2005, six,

413
00:23:03,181 --> 00:23:07,480
I thought it was a microphone for Internet
chat in 2007 they thought it was a

414
00:23:07,481 --> 00:23:11,050
Bluetooth phone, like a taxi drivers
started having hands free phone.

415
00:23:11,060 --> 00:23:12,550
So therefore thought it
was some kind of phoning.

416
00:23:12,580 --> 00:23:17,260
2009 people thought it was something to
do with Gopro that I was filming my life

417
00:23:17,830 --> 00:23:21,490
in 2012, uh, people started to think
it was something to do with Google,

418
00:23:21,520 --> 00:23:22,353
Google glass.

419
00:23:22,620 --> 00:23:27,550
It was sometime connected in
2014 15 they thought it was,

420
00:23:27,580 --> 00:23:32,460
well children asked me if it was some
kind of expendable selfie stick that and

421
00:23:32,470 --> 00:23:35,050
not lately for the last three,
three months,

422
00:23:35,051 --> 00:23:39,420
people point at me and they say Pokemon.
They thought it, I think Pokemon,

423
00:23:39,700 --> 00:23:43,720
they tried to catch me sometimes. So it
keeps changing. What people think it is.

424
00:23:43,750 --> 00:23:48,380
Hopefully in the 2010 people will just
think is an antenna and as a new sensory

425
00:23:48,410 --> 00:23:50,360
organ,
but it's still not happening.

426
00:23:53,280 --> 00:23:54,470
Yeah.
There's one,

427
00:23:54,480 --> 00:23:58,460
one way of the shine is also like
we created this siren sculptures.

428
00:23:58,500 --> 00:24:02,540
One is like the three d version of
my arm and the other one is like the

429
00:24:02,550 --> 00:24:07,550
immersion of Neil's head
and it was exhibited in
Barcelona and my arm would uh,

430
00:24:07,621 --> 00:24:11,640
would be connected to the
online seismograms like
my own arm and people were

431
00:24:11,641 --> 00:24:14,700
able to touch it. Then whenever there
isn't and there was an earthquake,

432
00:24:14,701 --> 00:24:17,370
they could fill it and we're going to
like say, well this culture it goes,

433
00:24:17,371 --> 00:24:20,580
it's a say a sculpture.
Can I get to a living organism?

434
00:24:20,610 --> 00:24:25,410
In Micah is was the earth and in Neal's
case it was connected actually to Neil's

435
00:24:25,411 --> 00:24:25,920
head.

436
00:24:25,920 --> 00:24:29,820
Yeah. So people in the gallery, they
could send colors to my head life.

437
00:24:29,821 --> 00:24:32,610
So one of the five connection
in the world for six months,

438
00:24:32,611 --> 00:24:36,360
it was the sculpture in the museum so I
can receive in college from visitors of

439
00:24:36,361 --> 00:24:40,260
the museum. It was overwhelming because
there were schools there as well.

440
00:24:40,261 --> 00:24:43,010
So they were sending lots of colors,
have blood every day.

441
00:24:43,880 --> 00:24:47,890
Am I one of my ways to share and sell?

442
00:24:47,891 --> 00:24:51,420
So the way in a performance and it's
called waiting for earthquakes was

443
00:24:51,540 --> 00:24:55,040
standstill on a place and then a
wait for an earthquake to take place,

444
00:24:55,041 --> 00:24:56,990
which is very often and whatever happens,

445
00:24:56,991 --> 00:24:59,900
I move according to the
intensity of the earthquake.

446
00:25:00,290 --> 00:25:04,790
So it's a durational business and have
big 89 and it can last 10 minutes.

447
00:25:04,791 --> 00:25:08,150
I can last hours.
And it's just a,

448
00:25:08,151 --> 00:25:12,050
it's like a dual between the earth
and myself live the earth is like the

449
00:25:12,051 --> 00:25:16,040
choreographer of the piece and I'm Josie
t interpretating the real data that is

450
00:25:16,041 --> 00:25:20,300
coming through, it's like an
invitation to the audience just to,

451
00:25:20,360 --> 00:25:24,620
to listen for a while the, the,
the natural movement of the earth.

452
00:25:25,010 --> 00:25:29,390
And also wanted to say that, um,
when the first time I had to, ah,

453
00:25:29,410 --> 00:25:31,280
there's the seismic
sensor at the beginning,

454
00:25:31,281 --> 00:25:34,160
I had to get used to fill
this with patients every day.

455
00:25:34,160 --> 00:25:38,780
And maybe if there was a big one in the
middle of the night, I would wake up.

456
00:25:38,781 --> 00:25:42,270
But at the end,
like now more yesterday and,

457
00:25:42,430 --> 00:25:45,870
and now it feels like
having two heartbeats,

458
00:25:46,010 --> 00:25:50,720
like I have my own and then this
constant aeration, mim and I, it's like,

459
00:25:50,900 --> 00:25:55,150
I mean, yeah, to be, it's like the earth,
the earth beat and then my heartbeat,

460
00:25:55,160 --> 00:25:56,240
like at the same time.

461
00:25:56,950 --> 00:26:00,880
And also though the space sometimes
in different places in New York,

462
00:26:00,881 --> 00:26:03,680
I have these new skip and uh,

463
00:26:03,700 --> 00:26:06,190
suddenly I appeared somewhere
in the street and a,

464
00:26:06,191 --> 00:26:10,300
and I have a paper explaining
what I do. And this was, uh,

465
00:26:10,330 --> 00:26:14,930
I was in the middle of the night waiting
in Times Square and some people lay

466
00:26:14,931 --> 00:26:18,640
down also. So it's like, it can
be, it can be, it's a piece of,

467
00:26:18,641 --> 00:26:23,320
it can be anywhere because it just
means standing there waiting for an

468
00:26:23,321 --> 00:26:28,020
earthquake. So yeah, like when, well,

469
00:26:28,110 --> 00:26:31,210
yeah, that's it. And then, uh, my, uh,

470
00:26:31,330 --> 00:26:35,620
my other thing is that I do it with
percussion and then we're going to show,

471
00:26:35,920 --> 00:26:40,030
so I can do seismic and I go
like size my bird question.

472
00:26:40,031 --> 00:26:44,940
Whether earth in this case would be like
the composer of the, I can play the,

473
00:26:44,941 --> 00:26:48,720
in the earthquake that happened in
real time through the runs on oil.

474
00:26:48,780 --> 00:26:53,550
I also create a scores like that.
They look like this. For example,

475
00:26:53,551 --> 00:26:54,930
when I perform the Mexico,

476
00:26:54,931 --> 00:26:59,550
I research all the earthquakes at that
and that that had taken place in x in

477
00:26:59,551 --> 00:27:04,500
Mexico for the last 50 years. And I
made a score that lasted eight minutes.

478
00:27:04,501 --> 00:27:05,630
So during the Amia,

479
00:27:05,640 --> 00:27:09,390
as I played on the size of negativity
that happened in that place,

480
00:27:09,570 --> 00:27:14,080
so it was a very divided
and very, uh, strong, uh,

481
00:27:14,090 --> 00:27:15,940
strongest score. So that, yeah, there's a,

482
00:27:16,010 --> 00:27:20,010
the score is based on the same seismic
activity of in a specific place.

483
00:27:20,660 --> 00:27:23,580
And they also transform these into,
into paintings.

484
00:27:23,581 --> 00:27:28,581
This is like a hundred a
century of earthquakes in
the u s and then I also have

485
00:27:29,541 --> 00:27:32,310
an a score,
but this is transformed into a painting.

486
00:27:33,460 --> 00:27:33,750
Okay.

487
00:27:33,750 --> 00:27:37,200
And I also lead a,
when I was doing the speed of,

488
00:27:37,201 --> 00:27:39,330
of the people walking in front of me,
uh,

489
00:27:39,540 --> 00:27:43,290
I seen it and I traveled around
and around Europe hitchhiking.

490
00:27:43,320 --> 00:27:48,320
And the aim was to rise to every capital
and I would define each capital with

491
00:27:48,700 --> 00:27:52,800
the speed of the citizen's walking on
it because I realized that depending of

492
00:27:52,801 --> 00:27:56,580
your context and depending where you are,
you tend to walk faster or slower.

493
00:27:56,790 --> 00:27:57,650
I'm like,
I'm amazed.

494
00:27:57,651 --> 00:28:02,651
I'm for scum and movement sense that we
have like a involuntary movement speed

495
00:28:03,480 --> 00:28:04,313
that we share.

496
00:28:04,350 --> 00:28:09,350
So I made like a dictionary to define
its capital of Europe by its movement and

497
00:28:09,661 --> 00:28:13,140
nail they its capital bureau by
the dominant color of the cities.

498
00:28:15,780 --> 00:28:16,051
Yeah.

499
00:28:16,051 --> 00:28:21,030
Like in 2010 and I tweeted the Cyborg
foundation basically with three aims.

500
00:28:21,150 --> 00:28:23,820
One is like to help
humans to become works.

501
00:28:24,240 --> 00:28:28,860
A second one would be the to defend the
sidewalk rights and a third one is to

502
00:28:28,861 --> 00:28:32,100
promote cyborgism as an
art and social movement

503
00:28:34,610 --> 00:28:35,443
eyes.

504
00:28:35,750 --> 00:28:38,120
We've done different budgets,
but we'll talk more about the,

505
00:28:38,121 --> 00:28:39,920
the following projects in the next week.

506
00:28:39,921 --> 00:28:42,320
We go into Brazil and
we'll be developing this.

507
00:28:42,350 --> 00:28:45,500
I have some spaces in my
mouth is something's missing.

508
00:28:45,501 --> 00:28:49,390
So instead of having no normal
days Englander, we'll create a DS.

509
00:28:49,400 --> 00:28:53,370
The do things like, um, we did
the prototype some years ago.

510
00:28:53,371 --> 00:28:54,880
It's the grades light.

511
00:28:54,881 --> 00:28:57,920
So in total darkness you can click and
then you open your mouth and then you

512
00:28:57,921 --> 00:28:59,060
have some emergency light.

513
00:28:59,540 --> 00:29:02,660
The case where they'd was that when I
was eating the language going on and off

514
00:29:02,661 --> 00:29:05,330
all the time.
So we added removing now in Brazil,

515
00:29:05,331 --> 00:29:08,900
we'll try to make one here that
will actually also charged by,

516
00:29:09,020 --> 00:29:13,540
by pressing it and it should create light,
um,

517
00:29:14,150 --> 00:29:16,370
in another system that doesn't
go on and off when I eat.

518
00:29:16,371 --> 00:29:20,330
And then the other space is the will god
and tried to trade the Bluetooth tools

519
00:29:20,570 --> 00:29:23,500
that will allow me to
control the antenna. So, uh,

520
00:29:23,570 --> 00:29:27,440
if I want my antenna to move left,
I'll be able to use my,

521
00:29:27,560 --> 00:29:31,340
these to move it left and right. So it
will allow me to lie like a joystick,

522
00:29:31,341 --> 00:29:31,880
but inside,

523
00:29:31,880 --> 00:29:36,440
inside the mouth and controls through
Bluetooth either this are the third option

524
00:29:36,441 --> 00:29:40,070
will be that we'll create two.
This cosmo now also has a tooth missing,

525
00:29:40,071 --> 00:29:42,130
so that's good for us
cause he has some space.

526
00:29:42,640 --> 00:29:45,280
And then we'll also use
the creation of Bluetooth,

527
00:29:45,320 --> 00:29:49,390
this and this case to communicate.
So we both know the Morse code.

528
00:29:49,400 --> 00:29:53,920
So if we both have a tooth
that can transfer the clicks,

529
00:29:53,921 --> 00:29:57,310
then we'll be able to communicate through
more scored from [inaudible] or from

530
00:29:57,311 --> 00:30:01,520
Bluetooth too, Bluetooth through
Bluetooth as one. And also that this,

531
00:30:01,570 --> 00:30:04,750
we might just spend them blue as well
cause then it will make more sense.

532
00:30:04,900 --> 00:30:07,750
So that's next week in in
Brazil and it will have,

533
00:30:07,870 --> 00:30:12,640
will have one week intensive with
16 people working on it. Also.

534
00:30:12,660 --> 00:30:17,120
Um,
we created a Cyborg nest this year in,

535
00:30:17,140 --> 00:30:19,960
in London where we are actually
offering sensors for other people.

536
00:30:19,961 --> 00:30:22,530
The first side is that we are offering,
this is the north stands.

537
00:30:22,550 --> 00:30:24,940
It can be implanted here
in the center of your body.

538
00:30:24,941 --> 00:30:27,100
And whenever you're faced
north you feel a vibration.

539
00:30:27,101 --> 00:30:29,620
So it gives you a sense of orientation.

540
00:30:29,621 --> 00:30:32,740
If you have this vibration when you
faced north west several months,

541
00:30:33,070 --> 00:30:34,930
it will probably become subliminal.

542
00:30:34,990 --> 00:30:38,560
So you will feel the north without
even noticing the vibration anymore.

543
00:30:39,130 --> 00:30:41,330
So this is uh, something that, uh,

544
00:30:41,331 --> 00:30:45,880
a few hundred people will have very
soon because it will be sent to people

545
00:30:45,881 --> 00:30:49,150
around the fall.
Um,

546
00:30:49,410 --> 00:30:49,940
yeah,
my,

547
00:30:49,940 --> 00:30:53,910
my current project now and
that I'm correlating with
some people that are here,

548
00:30:53,940 --> 00:30:55,090
it's thought works.
Um,

549
00:30:55,470 --> 00:30:59,430
I'm living like the seismic makes down
to my faith because it feels like more

550
00:30:59,431 --> 00:31:03,720
natural to feel earthquakes and you feed
and then I was hiding location cause

551
00:31:03,721 --> 00:31:06,750
now I just know when there's an article
but I don't know where in the world.

552
00:31:06,960 --> 00:31:07,441
So these,

553
00:31:07,441 --> 00:31:12,000
I will know if they are too happens very
far for what I am a very close and also

554
00:31:12,001 --> 00:31:13,890
like my next,
my next project is to feel,

555
00:31:13,940 --> 00:31:18,030
has an activity on the moon because we
feel that if we use internet as a sense,

556
00:31:18,031 --> 00:31:21,750
we can explore things that are happening
very far from when we are like in the

557
00:31:21,751 --> 00:31:26,480
other side of the plant or even in
the space. So if we all use, uh,

558
00:31:26,780 --> 00:31:29,880
AVL,
Santa was census the space rather than we,

559
00:31:29,881 --> 00:31:33,690
as soon as we can become sense turnouts
and explore a space where we are here

560
00:31:33,691 --> 00:31:35,430
but through our sensors.
Okay.

561
00:31:35,520 --> 00:31:39,990
Gimme since 2014 I've been connecting
to NASA's international space station so

562
00:31:39,991 --> 00:31:41,760
that I can send you the colors from space.

563
00:31:42,280 --> 00:31:45,150
The beginning it was overwhelming cause
there's loads of colors there that are

564
00:31:45,151 --> 00:31:49,260
very high bid. So it was overwhelming. But
then I'm getting used to connecting to,

565
00:31:49,300 --> 00:31:52,690
to the station and then I'm getting used
to receiving the college room space.

566
00:31:52,740 --> 00:31:57,000
So yes is extending our senses beyond
our bodies but also be on our planets.

567
00:31:57,060 --> 00:32:00,710
So in in the future we might able be
able to connect all our senses in other

568
00:32:00,720 --> 00:32:04,440
plans. Also when we have three d
printers that can print our DNA,

569
00:32:04,441 --> 00:32:06,900
we might be able to three d
print ourselves in other planets.

570
00:32:06,901 --> 00:32:08,970
So instead of traveling to other planets,

571
00:32:08,971 --> 00:32:12,810
we'll just need to three d print ourselves
in Mars and then use the Internet to

572
00:32:12,811 --> 00:32:15,580
extend our senses to margin
and feel it. We are there, uh,

573
00:32:15,690 --> 00:32:19,440
and even have our body there
without having to physically
travel in a way we are

574
00:32:19,441 --> 00:32:23,880
doing now. This is our little
experiments of, of sensing space.

575
00:32:23,910 --> 00:32:27,570
Also sharing these experiences by doing
space concerts where I amplify the

576
00:32:27,571 --> 00:32:29,070
sounds from my head to the audience.

577
00:32:29,310 --> 00:32:33,600
The first concert I had to stop because
I was getting dizzy of so many colors

578
00:32:33,601 --> 00:32:37,800
from space, but the audience had already
left. So it was fine. It was too noisy.

579
00:32:38,070 --> 00:32:42,410
The second concert, someone in the
audience had an epileptic attack.

580
00:32:42,500 --> 00:32:45,860
What is a seizure?
So we had to stop as well.

581
00:32:46,070 --> 00:32:47,860
We'll do a concert here now so

582
00:32:50,320 --> 00:32:53,030
he will do just a five
minutes. And then, um,

583
00:32:53,750 --> 00:32:58,520
well what I'm working now on with
Adrienne and Sam at thought works here.

584
00:32:58,530 --> 00:33:03,170
New York, we are developing a new sense
a, I've had this sense for 12 years now,

585
00:33:03,171 --> 00:33:05,120
so I feel I'm ready to add a new sense,

586
00:33:05,121 --> 00:33:07,760
completely different from
color and is the sense of time.

587
00:33:07,910 --> 00:33:11,420
We all have a sense of time, what we
don't have an organ for the sense of time.

588
00:33:11,421 --> 00:33:13,850
There's no species that has an
organ for the sense of time.

589
00:33:13,851 --> 00:33:17,480
So this is developing an organ
that will allow me to feel time,

590
00:33:17,690 --> 00:33:21,080
it will be a crown between the
skin and the bone circular.

591
00:33:21,350 --> 00:33:23,420
And then I'll feel different
heat depending on the time.

592
00:33:23,421 --> 00:33:27,650
So it will take 24 hours for the heat
to go around my head. So once I have it,

593
00:33:27,710 --> 00:33:31,580
I will know automatically what time it
is because I'll feel the heat around my

594
00:33:31,581 --> 00:33:32,410
head.
But then the,

595
00:33:32,410 --> 00:33:35,960
the question is whether or not
this becomes my perception of time.

596
00:33:35,990 --> 00:33:40,430
If I have this for several months or
years, I might not feel the heat anymore,

597
00:33:40,431 --> 00:33:43,700
but I'll feel the time it is.
So then when this point happens,

598
00:33:43,701 --> 00:33:48,590
then I'll be able to modify the speed
in which the heat goes around my head in

599
00:33:48,591 --> 00:33:51,980
order to change my perception of time.
So if I want time to go faster,

600
00:33:52,230 --> 00:33:56,090
I will change how fast I want the heat
to go around my head and 19 theory. Um,

601
00:33:56,091 --> 00:33:59,690
my perception of the time will will be
different. Or if I want to travel in time,

602
00:33:59,900 --> 00:34:02,810
I will be able to just the turnaround
they keep several times and then I'll,

603
00:34:02,811 --> 00:34:06,680
I'll be traveling in time or if
I'm jet lag or if I'm traveling,

604
00:34:06,681 --> 00:34:10,400
I might be able to put it on flight
mode and then I might have less, um,

605
00:34:10,730 --> 00:34:14,090
less jet lag if I make it travel to
this with the speed of the plane.

606
00:34:14,091 --> 00:34:18,400
So it's an experiment of taking Einstein's
theory of time relativity into uh,

607
00:34:18,460 --> 00:34:22,910
a sense and into a sensory organ.
And this will be more or less ready.

608
00:34:22,911 --> 00:34:27,140
This year I'm at least we'd have a
prototype, which is usually an XO sense.

609
00:34:27,170 --> 00:34:30,170
There's exoskeletons which are assigned,
but we also grade extra sensors,

610
00:34:30,171 --> 00:34:34,010
which are sensors that are permanently
outside for a while until your brain gets

611
00:34:34,011 --> 00:34:37,490
used to it. And then once the extra
sense is accepted by the brain,

612
00:34:37,670 --> 00:34:39,050
you can then have it implanted.

613
00:34:39,440 --> 00:34:42,110
So this is something that
will happen here in New York,

614
00:34:42,220 --> 00:34:45,070
this now and that now
that we feel that Neon,

615
00:34:45,071 --> 00:34:48,400
I assign books that we actually don't
feel cross two machines at the Roberts.

616
00:34:48,401 --> 00:34:49,870
We feel closer to nature.

617
00:34:49,871 --> 00:34:53,290
And to other animals because I fit
closer to the planet because it's very

618
00:34:53,291 --> 00:34:57,070
different to know that the planet is
moving, that to feel that in your body,

619
00:34:57,071 --> 00:34:58,630
that the planet is constantly moving.

620
00:34:59,080 --> 00:35:03,130
And also we think that we can get very
inspired by other senses animals have

621
00:35:03,380 --> 00:35:05,410
because if we experience
the world through,

622
00:35:05,770 --> 00:35:09,400
through the senses that all the
animals having in our own nature,

623
00:35:09,460 --> 00:35:11,550
I would spin off the plant
will be very different.

624
00:35:12,380 --> 00:35:16,040
Yeah. We both think we are experienced
in the renascence of our species.

625
00:35:16,041 --> 00:35:19,910
We are the first generation
that can actually really
design what sensors we want

626
00:35:19,911 --> 00:35:22,000
to have,
what Oregon's we want to have.

627
00:35:22,001 --> 00:35:24,530
We can actually design what
species we want to become.

628
00:35:24,680 --> 00:35:27,890
We can either get inspired by species
of half senses and organs that we don't

629
00:35:27,891 --> 00:35:30,110
have an add them to our, uh, our bodies.

630
00:35:30,111 --> 00:35:35,111
We actually identify ourselves as trans
species because we are a greeting or

631
00:35:35,271 --> 00:35:37,680
adding senses and organs
that other species have.

632
00:35:37,681 --> 00:35:41,310
So we define ourselves as trans species
and in the same way that the 20th

633
00:35:41,311 --> 00:35:45,420
century saw transgender, uh, becoming
normal, I think in the 21st century.

634
00:35:45,421 --> 00:35:48,240
We'll see how trans species also
will be more and more normal.

635
00:35:48,241 --> 00:35:50,560
We'll be meeting people with
new senses and new organs.

636
00:35:50,561 --> 00:35:54,540
Some of these senses and organs
will be a known by other species.

637
00:35:54,540 --> 00:35:56,940
Some of them will be
new because for example,

638
00:35:56,950 --> 00:36:01,950
Internet connection is a new sense that
will only be used in certain cases.

639
00:36:03,030 --> 00:36:07,200
But we'll see that we'll be able to
decide what type of species we want to

640
00:36:07,201 --> 00:36:10,380
become. And that's the exciting
thing that we are experiencing now,

641
00:36:10,381 --> 00:36:14,910
especially when we have the option
of three d printing new organs. Uh,

642
00:36:14,940 --> 00:36:16,950
we won't even need the
electronics anywhere.

643
00:36:16,960 --> 00:36:21,130
We'll be able to modify our
genes and create, um, also, uh,

644
00:36:21,140 --> 00:36:22,290
organic body parts.

645
00:36:22,291 --> 00:36:27,180
So the fact that we are
now using technology will
probably be obsolete in a few

646
00:36:27,180 --> 00:36:30,260
decades and we'll start
using 100% organic, uh,

647
00:36:30,690 --> 00:36:34,710
Oregon's new organs. And also we'll be
modifying our senses. So instead of,

648
00:36:35,010 --> 00:36:37,620
in my case, perceiving ultraviolet
and infrared with a chip,

649
00:36:37,830 --> 00:36:41,250
it will be by modifying my jeans.
So that's probably the end of the century.

650
00:36:41,251 --> 00:36:44,220
But we are both very excited about
the possibility of these are,

651
00:36:44,221 --> 00:36:48,510
we can now start to explore, um,
just when I think it's just this,

652
00:36:48,511 --> 00:36:51,300
this is just something extra that
we are presenting various soon.

653
00:36:51,320 --> 00:36:54,000
It's a new type of a close,
it's,

654
00:36:54,001 --> 00:36:58,830
I'm a fashion show that we are presenting
in October in the Queens Museum.

655
00:36:58,860 --> 00:37:01,890
It's close for the pose,
a wearable generation.

656
00:37:01,891 --> 00:37:03,940
So people who don't
want to wear technology,

657
00:37:03,990 --> 00:37:07,230
people who want to become technology
will also need new type of clothes.

658
00:37:07,231 --> 00:37:09,540
In my case,
there's no hoodies with holes in it,

659
00:37:09,541 --> 00:37:13,820
so I can't wear it because
there's no brand that creates, uh,

660
00:37:13,860 --> 00:37:18,370
who this for people that have antennas,
also people who have the chip here, uh,

661
00:37:18,390 --> 00:37:20,540
they need to charge themselves.
So there's a,

662
00:37:20,550 --> 00:37:24,330
there'll be tee shirts with holes here
so that they can plug themselves or

663
00:37:24,390 --> 00:37:27,420
they'll also have a door. And also with
design, different types, of course,

664
00:37:27,421 --> 00:37:30,530
with different types of cyber.
George Wilbur's be presented, uh, uh,

665
00:37:30,600 --> 00:37:34,430
in October 8th and the Queens Museum, you
are all invited. It will be a catwalk.

666
00:37:34,440 --> 00:37:36,230
Weather models will be sideboards.

667
00:37:36,270 --> 00:37:39,270
There'll be 10 different types of sight
words and there'll be wearing clothes

668
00:37:39,271 --> 00:37:42,990
adapted to these.
There's new technological bodies.

669
00:37:43,920 --> 00:37:45,870
That's it.
Thank you very much for listening.

670
00:37:49,580 --> 00:37:51,070
How'd you play your colors from

671
00:37:51,360 --> 00:37:52,193
space?

672
00:37:52,500 --> 00:37:57,330
I am alone will be performing the
earthquakes that she feels during the,

673
00:37:57,360 --> 00:38:00,600
these five minutes. If there's no worries
because there'll be no much running,

674
00:38:01,290 --> 00:38:02,280
but there's always

675
00:38:04,770 --> 00:38:05,603
okay.

676
00:38:47,540 --> 00:38:52,540
[inaudible]

677
00:42:51,480 --> 00:42:52,313
yeah.

678
00:43:42,440 --> 00:43:47,440
[inaudible]

679
00:43:49,610 --> 00:43:54,500
so you talked about a few different
kinds of cyborgs. Um, and I,

680
00:43:54,560 --> 00:43:58,130
we were talking about earlier there
were there these guys in Sweden,

681
00:43:58,131 --> 00:43:59,970
they have like a,
we work and they've,

682
00:44:00,060 --> 00:44:05,060
everyone working in that space has
implanted a chip under their skin and they

683
00:44:05,391 --> 00:44:09,450
just opened a door instead
of swiping their budgets. Um,

684
00:44:09,650 --> 00:44:13,070
they just opened the door like that.
So that would be a kind of Cyborg.

685
00:44:13,580 --> 00:44:15,290
You're kind of,
Cyborg is a little bit different.

686
00:44:15,470 --> 00:44:19,640
So I know you've been thinking and
talking a lot about cyborgs. Tell me,

687
00:44:19,670 --> 00:44:24,260
what do you think is high work is and
we'll kind of cyborgs are there in your

688
00:44:24,261 --> 00:44:28,010
mind, you guys think in general
there's like two big rooms,

689
00:44:28,011 --> 00:44:30,900
like the psychological
cyborgs and biological side.

690
00:44:31,200 --> 00:44:33,870
I think you are all psychological cyborg.

691
00:44:33,871 --> 00:44:38,580
So we are all psychologically United to
cybernetics. I in many ways, you know,

692
00:44:38,581 --> 00:44:41,640
there's this in language,
maybe 20 years ago people would say,

693
00:44:41,641 --> 00:44:43,620
my mobile phone is running out of battery.

694
00:44:43,830 --> 00:44:47,720
Now many people say I'm running out of
battery as if they were the mobile phones.

695
00:44:47,721 --> 00:44:51,390
So talking about technology and
first person is a sign of connection,

696
00:44:51,391 --> 00:44:54,810
psychological union between
technology and humans.

697
00:44:55,140 --> 00:44:56,700
That's a psychological unit.
Also,

698
00:44:56,701 --> 00:44:59,500
many people identify
themselves as being cyborgs,

699
00:44:59,530 --> 00:45:01,890
but that their body is not cyber.
But they,

700
00:45:01,920 --> 00:45:05,250
that's why they want to have an implant
because they identify themselves as

701
00:45:05,251 --> 00:45:06,100
being cyborg.

702
00:45:06,660 --> 00:45:10,770
And then that's why they went to have
surgery to become biological cybers in in

703
00:45:10,771 --> 00:45:12,400
the world of biological side,
where's [inaudible],

704
00:45:12,540 --> 00:45:15,540
which is a biological union
between cybernetics and organism.

705
00:45:15,780 --> 00:45:18,100
There's also two types. Uh, at least, uh,

706
00:45:18,101 --> 00:45:21,330
one would be that you are a
cyber because of medical reasons.

707
00:45:21,331 --> 00:45:25,080
So it's not voluntarily not
have a choice. Uh, it's,

708
00:45:25,450 --> 00:45:28,920
it's either also to regenerate the Briggs,
this thing sends or preexisting by,

709
00:45:29,040 --> 00:45:33,510
and then there's voluntary side was people
who voluntarily have added technology

710
00:45:33,511 --> 00:45:36,150
in their body in order to
either add a new sensor,

711
00:45:36,160 --> 00:45:40,230
a new ability in the case of voluntary.
So I was, there's also different types.

712
00:45:40,260 --> 00:45:45,110
They would be sensory sidewards. In
our case we are adding sensors. Uh,

713
00:45:45,180 --> 00:45:49,410
so it's a sensory cyborg. Then there's
the cognitive side where you'd would be,

714
00:45:49,470 --> 00:45:52,080
if it's technology to add to
things like memory for example.

715
00:45:52,090 --> 00:45:55,530
That's not the sense where it's something
cognitive or if you want to have some

716
00:45:55,560 --> 00:45:58,260
implanted so that you can
understand different languages.

717
00:45:58,290 --> 00:46:00,240
That's not the sentence.
Also something cognitive.

718
00:46:00,241 --> 00:46:03,960
So it's a learning or being able to
communicate in different languages with a

719
00:46:03,961 --> 00:46:08,480
chip. So it's communication.
So that's more cognitive
Cyborg. And then there's, um,

720
00:46:09,020 --> 00:46:13,920
physicals. I would say more about
the, something more of a physical, um,

721
00:46:14,460 --> 00:46:16,680
implants.
So that gives you some physical ability.

722
00:46:17,190 --> 00:46:20,400
And then in the case of opening
and closing, it's not a sense.

723
00:46:20,401 --> 00:46:23,460
It would be also a type of
voluntary side word, but it's a,

724
00:46:23,470 --> 00:46:26,370
it wouldn't be a sensory side where
it wouldn't be more of a practical and

725
00:46:26,371 --> 00:46:27,790
cognitive may way.

726
00:46:27,791 --> 00:46:31,200
Cause I think you can share information
as well with other people and also you

727
00:46:31,201 --> 00:46:34,520
can then track where you've been
so it can help memory. So it's,

728
00:46:34,590 --> 00:46:36,570
it's a way of extending your,

729
00:46:36,980 --> 00:46:39,900
a cognitive or also
abilities with technology.

730
00:46:44,020 --> 00:46:46,530
Thank you for,
it's such a fascinating and amazing talk.

731
00:46:47,920 --> 00:46:50,530
I was actually thinking if my
four year old would be here,

732
00:46:50,590 --> 00:46:54,250
he would be like out of his mind
thinking what is going on here.

733
00:46:55,570 --> 00:46:59,830
I've been very excited. Um,
I have a question about that.

734
00:46:59,831 --> 00:47:04,250
The Fisk psychologic cause by Lowe's
aspect in relation to that that uh,

735
00:47:04,260 --> 00:47:05,830
I was thinking how the,

736
00:47:05,831 --> 00:47:10,460
you also mentioned in the talk a little
bit about subliminal aspect after

737
00:47:10,470 --> 00:47:12,430
awhile,
once he had the chip,

738
00:47:13,510 --> 00:47:18,510
the sentence or the new sentence became
subliminally that you stop actually

739
00:47:19,571 --> 00:47:24,030
listening or paying attention to that.
But you're still nevertheless,

740
00:47:24,040 --> 00:47:28,590
you still had that sentence coming
through in some way. So, uh,

741
00:47:28,600 --> 00:47:30,520
especially the,
maybe the,

742
00:47:30,910 --> 00:47:35,820
the not for the light to,
not for the color to the sound transform,

743
00:47:35,830 --> 00:47:40,720
but the earthquake sees firmographics
and transform maybe easier that hey,

744
00:47:40,810 --> 00:47:45,760
now that I have learned that so much and
the cognition had expanded beyond the

745
00:47:45,790 --> 00:47:50,590
sense or into my,
the five senses that we had.

746
00:47:51,030 --> 00:47:55,220
Um,
the new s chip isn't needed anymore.

747
00:47:55,240 --> 00:47:58,820
It's so part of me now that the nearby,

748
00:47:58,821 --> 00:48:03,610
if skin now have started by rating even
without the chip and artspeak happens,

749
00:48:03,810 --> 00:48:07,390
I'm just thinking like how deep,
how long and in general,

750
00:48:07,391 --> 00:48:10,450
like how long does it take to
get that subliminal aspect?

751
00:48:12,090 --> 00:48:14,280
I think for every,

752
00:48:14,730 --> 00:48:18,270
every person varies in any
sense is always different.

753
00:48:18,271 --> 00:48:22,380
Like to learn a new language. Some
people take a long time and some people,

754
00:48:22,950 --> 00:48:24,450
some people learn it really fast.

755
00:48:24,510 --> 00:48:29,080
So for me to wait a month
or something to add,

756
00:48:29,081 --> 00:48:34,081
like really used to feel this and now
maybe in the beginning I would start more

757
00:48:34,951 --> 00:48:35,341
lively,

758
00:48:35,341 --> 00:48:40,341
more this like if I would feel a strong
innovation would have pauses when I talk

759
00:48:40,461 --> 00:48:43,650
or what I've been told that um,
and now,

760
00:48:43,651 --> 00:48:47,250
yeah I guess this is normal I guess
like if I don't feel it, it's when I,

761
00:48:47,270 --> 00:48:52,270
I I realized that that's something I
haven't found this relations for a long

762
00:48:53,311 --> 00:48:57,480
time, but I guess in any nuisance and
every person, that's exciting to think.

763
00:48:57,481 --> 00:49:00,930
For example, when the north sense
several people will have the same sense,

764
00:49:01,260 --> 00:49:04,860
we had really excited to see what will
happen because everyone will have its own

765
00:49:04,861 --> 00:49:09,450
experience and its own way of integrating
these new sense in their own one is

766
00:49:09,451 --> 00:49:10,284
I'm like,
yeah,

767
00:49:10,870 --> 00:49:15,150
somewhat. If someone becomes
a cyber there'll be two,
two periods of adaptation.

768
00:49:15,151 --> 00:49:19,230
When is the,
how the brain adapts to the new sense.

769
00:49:19,260 --> 00:49:22,200
That takes a while for each person.
And then there's also the,

770
00:49:22,530 --> 00:49:25,860
how the body accepts the new body parts.
So you can have brain rejection.

771
00:49:25,861 --> 00:49:29,880
Your brain might not accept the new
sense or you might have body rejection,

772
00:49:29,881 --> 00:49:34,260
your body might not accept the new
Oregon cause most sensors will need New

773
00:49:34,260 --> 00:49:35,430
Orleans because we don't,

774
00:49:35,720 --> 00:49:40,050
we think is not useful to use
existing sensors to gain a new sense.

775
00:49:40,360 --> 00:49:41,310
That's why we reject them.

776
00:49:41,311 --> 00:49:44,860
They use of glasses or headphones
or any of our existing sensors.

777
00:49:44,861 --> 00:49:47,680
We wanted to have new
senses and that food,

778
00:49:48,120 --> 00:49:50,960
new sensory organs in our cases.
So yeah.

779
00:49:51,140 --> 00:49:51,321
Yeah.

780
00:49:51,321 --> 00:49:55,880
And before implanted regionally to
prototypes or like extra senses like first

781
00:49:55,881 --> 00:49:57,980
the outside and when,
then when we,

782
00:49:58,210 --> 00:50:01,270
when the brain, next types of the new
sense, then you can go for the implant.

783
00:50:01,271 --> 00:50:04,360
And then if your body accepts
the new material in your body,

784
00:50:04,361 --> 00:50:05,800
then you've had both.

785
00:50:06,480 --> 00:50:09,500
And is that a success ratio
with you? They, oh, this sensor,

786
00:50:09,560 --> 00:50:14,470
I put it in as a headband or a hand.
Men and my body's completely rejecting it.

787
00:50:15,580 --> 00:50:17,890
Firstly,
your brain might reject the new sense.

788
00:50:17,891 --> 00:50:21,820
So maybe I had this brain rejection.
For example,

789
00:50:21,821 --> 00:50:26,350
my brain didn't accept all these new
input, so I had strong headaches and uh,

790
00:50:26,710 --> 00:50:29,600
but I kept it on the Indian.
The headaches went away.

791
00:50:29,601 --> 00:50:33,910
But some people might want to stop
if they, if their body doesn't match.

792
00:50:34,130 --> 00:50:37,570
Mine does except the new sense.
And my Mike, his body rejection,

793
00:50:37,580 --> 00:50:40,640
there was no rejection of the,
of the implant material.

794
00:50:41,060 --> 00:50:41,893
Nice.
Thank you.

795
00:50:42,750 --> 00:50:46,260
But I sometimes have antenna
aches, which is something that, uh,

796
00:50:46,320 --> 00:50:47,400
then I just pick a,

797
00:50:47,430 --> 00:50:51,750
like I have headaches or say [inaudible]
and then I take a tablet and then pin

798
00:50:51,751 --> 00:50:52,584
goes.

799
00:50:56,520 --> 00:50:57,353
MMM.

800
00:50:58,520 --> 00:51:02,990
I was curious if you, so synesthesia,
it's uh, existing sentence.

801
00:51:02,991 --> 00:51:07,160
These people that are born with like a
sound and color being molded together,

802
00:51:07,161 --> 00:51:10,640
they have, there's really no choice in
what tones correspond to which colors.

803
00:51:10,910 --> 00:51:14,270
Do you imagine people that would have
a similar implant to you could choose

804
00:51:14,540 --> 00:51:17,460
different tones to correspond
to different colors. Uh,

805
00:51:18,140 --> 00:51:22,970
and then when you compose pieces of
music, uh, like it will, that speech,

806
00:51:22,971 --> 00:51:27,020
that visual representation of a speech
will only represent that speech to

807
00:51:27,021 --> 00:51:28,940
someone who has the exact same,

808
00:51:29,270 --> 00:51:32,240
who listens to colors in the same way
that you perceive them. I don't know.

809
00:51:32,241 --> 00:51:35,390
Have you ever, I guess what, yeah,
how do you define those relations?

810
00:51:35,550 --> 00:51:37,950
Yeah, they didn't want to juice
the, the sound of the colors.

811
00:51:38,020 --> 00:51:41,640
That's why I didn't choose,
no one chose is the frequency of light.

812
00:51:41,670 --> 00:51:45,780
So if you could hear the frequency of red,
you would hear the note that I hear,

813
00:51:45,781 --> 00:51:48,660
which is a microtone between
F and f sharp. So each,

814
00:51:49,140 --> 00:51:53,250
that's why it's so micro tonal cause
it's the pure transposition. Um,

815
00:51:53,340 --> 00:51:57,340
otherwise I would have done a
much more simple scale cause uh,

816
00:51:57,360 --> 00:51:59,760
it took me three years
to memorize the colors,

817
00:51:59,761 --> 00:52:04,500
whereas it good just take hours if
you simplified the scale. So, um,

818
00:52:04,660 --> 00:52:09,660
it's a more objective way of possible
is as bill buhr relation as possible.

819
00:52:10,110 --> 00:52:14,310
There's no subjectivity in this case.
It's just physical transposition.

820
00:52:14,610 --> 00:52:15,130
Yeah.

821
00:52:15,130 --> 00:52:19,660
And then the, uh, talking about
mixing it into existing senses,

822
00:52:19,661 --> 00:52:21,000
have you considered adding,

823
00:52:21,530 --> 00:52:22,530
uh,
yes,

824
00:52:22,800 --> 00:52:24,420
sensors into nerves.

825
00:52:24,600 --> 00:52:27,330
And I don't know if you can do that
without it being necessarily a painful

826
00:52:27,331 --> 00:52:30,960
response, but you're hearing,
you're seeing through your

827
00:52:32,300 --> 00:52:33,133
hearing,

828
00:52:33,460 --> 00:52:35,020
you're seeing through another sense

829
00:52:35,350 --> 00:52:39,160
nothing my case cause that what I
hear is not what this is for me.

830
00:52:39,161 --> 00:52:44,161
The sense of hearing this is a vibration
in my bowl that then becomes an inner

831
00:52:44,381 --> 00:52:47,770
sound bite is not like this.
It's different. And it's um,

832
00:52:47,830 --> 00:52:51,100
if I was completely deaf I could still
perceive color through the vibrations.

833
00:52:51,101 --> 00:52:55,450
So this is a new sense to me.
And so,

834
00:52:55,930 --> 00:53:00,610
and also we don't have five senses.
We, we might have five sensory organs,

835
00:53:00,700 --> 00:53:04,740
but we have many, many, many more sensors
like the sense of gravity, for example,

836
00:53:04,750 --> 00:53:08,080
the sense of balance or
the sense of humor. Oh,

837
00:53:08,170 --> 00:53:11,770
common sense as well because there's
many sensors that don't have organs,

838
00:53:11,771 --> 00:53:14,830
like the sense of time, which is
now the creation of a new sense of,

839
00:53:14,831 --> 00:53:18,460
of that we have maybe just,
yeah, five sensory organs.

840
00:53:18,461 --> 00:53:21,820
But the fact that we have a long
list of sensors that don't have hard.

841
00:53:22,790 --> 00:53:26,250
Thank you. Oh, hello.

842
00:53:26,250 --> 00:53:31,000
Uh, thank you for coming here. I have a
specific question for Neil and full moon.

843
00:53:31,001 --> 00:53:34,330
So for me, for Neil's,
since your equipment, is it
connected to the Internet?

844
00:53:34,660 --> 00:53:39,410
What are the security risks of that
and how do you deal with them? Um,

845
00:53:39,610 --> 00:53:41,500
and for a moon,

846
00:53:41,770 --> 00:53:45,510
how exactly does the feeling you,
you're,

847
00:53:45,540 --> 00:53:50,380
your body gets upon seismic seismic
activity. How does that, um,

848
00:53:50,710 --> 00:53:55,090
influence the way you interpret it
whenever you perform the seismic activity?

849
00:53:56,730 --> 00:54:00,720
Yeah, I feel to relations and the
separations are really, really Sarah,

850
00:54:00,750 --> 00:54:04,670
like really low.
And then when I feel it,

851
00:54:04,680 --> 00:54:08,280
then ninth I transform it with intensity.

852
00:54:08,281 --> 00:54:10,320
So the bending of
intensity of the aeration,

853
00:54:10,560 --> 00:54:13,500
the move when I created this
more intense or less intense.

854
00:54:15,370 --> 00:54:18,910
Yeah. Having your body connected to the
Internet has the risk of being physically

855
00:54:18,911 --> 00:54:22,660
hacked. So now there's five
people with permission. But, uh,

856
00:54:22,690 --> 00:54:26,350
last year someone with no permission
was able actually to hack,

857
00:54:26,410 --> 00:54:29,590
do send colors to my head,
uh, without permission.

858
00:54:29,591 --> 00:54:33,460
So I was physically high action.
Actually. I liked it. So it wasn't,

859
00:54:39,170 --> 00:54:39,701
but yeah,

860
00:54:39,701 --> 00:54:43,600
they could become annoying if someone
started sending colors in the middle of

861
00:54:43,600 --> 00:54:46,630
the night, it would wake
me up. So if this happens,

862
00:54:46,631 --> 00:54:49,540
then this could be secured more secure.
But still,

863
00:54:49,541 --> 00:54:54,400
if there's a hacker in this room, they
can easily find me and they could, uh,

864
00:54:55,420 --> 00:54:58,180
send colors.
This is not as secure as it could be,

865
00:54:59,100 --> 00:55:03,300
but like, I wonder if even just like
all, just like trying to like filter out,

866
00:55:04,140 --> 00:55:08,980
um, which pat gets to authenticate
what that alone could I,

867
00:55:09,030 --> 00:55:09,460
I mean,

868
00:55:09,460 --> 00:55:14,460
cadaver loan and we'll even though denial
of service attack people or will you

869
00:55:14,701 --> 00:55:19,701
still be vulnerable to kind of attack
even just by sending just like packets?

870
00:55:19,771 --> 00:55:22,840
I wouldn't be authenticated anyway
if you got too many of them.

871
00:55:22,920 --> 00:55:26,880
What does every, everything is
hackable. Everything even so.

872
00:55:27,240 --> 00:55:28,930
Yeah.
Yes.

873
00:55:29,490 --> 00:55:30,450
Well, yeah. And there's always the,

874
00:55:30,451 --> 00:55:33,320
I can always disconnect the Internet
connection that I have this,

875
00:55:33,520 --> 00:55:37,170
I can stop this, the under, but I
can stop the Internet connection.

876
00:55:37,171 --> 00:55:39,920
So if it was really an eye,
I would just disconnect.

877
00:55:40,250 --> 00:55:44,250
Oh, okay. That's good. Thank you.

878
00:55:45,060 --> 00:55:45,950
Uh Huh.

879
00:55:46,090 --> 00:55:47,890
Uh, two, uh, two quick questions.

880
00:55:47,891 --> 00:55:51,430
I was kind of wondering just about some
basic hardware, technological issues.

881
00:55:51,431 --> 00:55:54,940
Like how do you keep your implants charge,
how often you have to recharge,

882
00:55:54,941 --> 00:55:58,930
MDF like charging ports on you.
And then also you said that you hear like,

883
00:55:58,960 --> 00:56:02,890
you know, hundreds of different specific,
uh, exact colors is different pitches.

884
00:56:03,370 --> 00:56:06,700
Did you have perfect pitch before you
started this or did you learn perfect

885
00:56:06,701 --> 00:56:08,530
pitch from having the implant?

886
00:56:09,030 --> 00:56:09,380
Okay.

887
00:56:09,380 --> 00:56:10,640
And then have perfect pitch.

888
00:56:10,641 --> 00:56:15,641
So I add relative pitch
but then after three years,

889
00:56:16,130 --> 00:56:19,930
so yeah, if you hear color
constantly, then it's,

890
00:56:20,060 --> 00:56:21,860
it's easier to,
to learn.

891
00:56:21,861 --> 00:56:26,861
Perfect pitch cause it's it also in
one octave and it's in a specific,

892
00:56:26,981 --> 00:56:30,400
um, timber. So I have perfect extreme,

893
00:56:30,401 --> 00:56:35,330
perfect pitch in an octave, in sine
waves through bone conduction. If it's a,

894
00:56:35,331 --> 00:56:36,460
if I listened to a guitar,

895
00:56:36,461 --> 00:56:40,080
it takes me a bit longer to identify
the note because it's a different timber

896
00:56:40,300 --> 00:56:42,340
and it comes through it.
And if it's a different octave,

897
00:56:42,370 --> 00:56:46,440
I need to think a bit more. But yes,
in that activists is now perfectly I,

898
00:56:46,441 --> 00:56:49,100
it took me three years to
memorize all these microphones.

899
00:56:49,130 --> 00:56:53,380
So betweenF and f sharp, I have
30 micro tones. So extremely,

900
00:56:53,530 --> 00:56:58,530
extremely my good Donald and the charging
aspect of of a a new sense and a new

901
00:56:58,991 --> 00:57:01,240
organ is very important as well.

902
00:57:02,060 --> 00:57:05,740
The problems that we have in the sidewalk
is the, I guess the power Paul Rum.

903
00:57:05,990 --> 00:57:06,180
Yeah.

904
00:57:06,180 --> 00:57:10,690
We would like to be able to power our
and with our own energy that the license,

905
00:57:10,691 --> 00:57:13,320
that's the Yang.
I have the bag.

906
00:57:14,080 --> 00:57:18,580
Let's think I can change a
small battery every five, six,

907
00:57:18,640 --> 00:57:21,620
seven weeks. The Benz, I
remove it before it ends.

908
00:57:21,621 --> 00:57:25,280
But the aim is to use Durbin's in
the blood vessels so that the blood

909
00:57:25,281 --> 00:57:29,240
circulation, we'll charge
the, the new sensors, not,

910
00:57:29,270 --> 00:57:32,710
we don't want to use external
energy, not even solar energy. One,

911
00:57:32,720 --> 00:57:36,260
they use the energy of our body.
In the case of the north sense,

912
00:57:36,620 --> 00:57:39,040
people will have to plug
themselves every night.

913
00:57:39,041 --> 00:57:43,180
So or so they'll have a
way of judging the subs.

914
00:57:43,260 --> 00:57:47,320
And also there's ways
we exploring with uh,

915
00:57:47,530 --> 00:57:50,420
Orient and Sam is the judgment external.
Kyle.

916
00:57:50,780 --> 00:57:54,920
So you might have an implant
was with Kyle. You can
recharge it from the outside.

917
00:57:55,610 --> 00:57:59,870
Also with the toes next week it will
be charged poly with um, like, uh,

918
00:58:00,130 --> 00:58:04,160
with your own kinetic energy.
So there's still ways, but it's,

919
00:58:04,380 --> 00:58:07,400
that's the,
whenever there's is solve,

920
00:58:07,640 --> 00:58:12,640
we'll see a boom of people with new senses
and new organs cause that's the only

921
00:58:13,671 --> 00:58:17,810
parts of it that is really not
evolving as fast. Thank you.

922
00:58:20,730 --> 00:58:24,870
So I wanted to thank you for
this presentation and uh,

923
00:58:24,900 --> 00:58:27,120
I also appreciated that you brought up,
uh,

924
00:58:27,150 --> 00:58:30,810
transgender as a topic within this
because I often feel as if I'm a

925
00:58:30,811 --> 00:58:32,760
psychological cyborg and I feel that,

926
00:58:32,761 --> 00:58:36,000
that it's actually a very common
sentiment among my people. Um,

927
00:58:36,030 --> 00:58:37,650
I feel as if we are,
uh,

928
00:58:37,770 --> 00:58:42,720
perhaps artists building the same thing
with different materials, in fact.

929
00:58:42,721 --> 00:58:46,320
And so my question is a
philosophical one in that,

930
00:58:46,620 --> 00:58:51,240
what do you think are the longterm
implications of a species that is able to

931
00:58:51,450 --> 00:58:53,850
design and redesign itself at will?

932
00:58:56,830 --> 00:58:58,930
Yeah. I think we'll have to
adjust. The net would be many,

933
00:58:58,931 --> 00:59:03,110
many different types of
species cause um, each, uh,

934
00:59:03,430 --> 00:59:04,840
human will make me born human,

935
00:59:04,841 --> 00:59:09,430
but then we'll be able to choose and
decide exactly what sends an order is when

936
00:59:09,431 --> 00:59:11,860
you have and each person
will be very unique I think.

937
00:59:11,861 --> 00:59:15,410
So we'll have a diversity that uh,

938
00:59:15,840 --> 00:59:18,490
society's probably not ready to accept.

939
00:59:18,530 --> 00:59:21,320
The diversity that will exist in the,

940
00:59:21,410 --> 00:59:23,720
in the fifties and sixties is a,

941
00:59:23,721 --> 00:59:28,380
is going to be something that many people
won't be able to talk to tolerate or to

942
00:59:28,680 --> 00:59:32,910
do you think then that this is a movement
away from my binary mode of thinking

943
00:59:32,911 --> 00:59:34,410
and learning within the human brain?

944
00:59:35,150 --> 00:59:35,983
Okay.

945
00:59:35,990 --> 00:59:40,000
Yes. I mean [inaudible] going to
be on the binary do it will be, um,

946
00:59:40,400 --> 00:59:44,960
there'll be so many [inaudible] we
won't be even able to understand,

947
00:59:45,840 --> 00:59:46,673
um,

948
00:59:47,120 --> 00:59:51,290
the types of realities that
each person will experience.

949
00:59:51,320 --> 00:59:56,030
It will be even more different than it
will be evident that it will be different.

950
00:59:56,140 --> 00:59:58,280
The experience that we
all have of a reality.

951
00:59:59,260 --> 01:00:03,480
We mentioned [inaudible] in the future
and asking someone where were they from

952
01:00:03,481 --> 01:00:06,150
there.
We also asked what sense do you have like,

953
01:00:06,450 --> 01:00:11,220
and everyone will have its own own
perception or reality. That's beautiful.

954
01:00:11,221 --> 01:00:12,054
Thank you.

955
01:00:14,290 --> 01:00:17,080
Right.
Lovely to

956
01:00:18,630 --> 01:00:22,660
do so. We'll have to say goodbye. Thanks
so much for coming. Thank you, Neil.

957
01:00:22,661 --> 01:00:23,470
Thank you.
No.
