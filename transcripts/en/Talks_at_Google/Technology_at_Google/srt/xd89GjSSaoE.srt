1
00:00:05,240 --> 00:00:07,080
With that very humbling introduction,

2
00:00:08,320 --> 00:00:11,850
kind of rounding applause
from Robbie Brown. Wow.

3
00:00:12,660 --> 00:00:17,460
I like to meet that guy. He sounds
really impressive. Uh, thank you. Uh,

4
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:21,560
first of all, uh, thanks to Google
for hosting all of us here today, um,

5
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:26,310
and the campus that you're building here
in boulders is beautiful and we're all

6
00:00:26,311 --> 00:00:31,230
very happy to have you in our
city and, and in our state. Um,

7
00:00:31,350 --> 00:00:31,861
as I said,

8
00:00:31,861 --> 00:00:35,370
my name is Bobby Brown and I'm the
dean of the College of Engineering and

9
00:00:35,490 --> 00:00:38,520
Applied Science at the University
of Colorado Boulder. Uh,

10
00:00:38,550 --> 00:00:43,230
we are among the fastest
growing engineering colleges
and we're actually one of

11
00:00:43,231 --> 00:00:46,680
the most diverse colleges of
engineering in the country.

12
00:00:47,010 --> 00:00:49,410
And that's something that
we're really proud about, uh,

13
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:54,440
because it allows us to reach out and
partner more with industry in our state

14
00:00:54,570 --> 00:00:59,220
and including, uh, Google.
Uh, I'm a Mars Guy, um,

15
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:02,140
uh, I guess, uh, maybe a Martian, uh, in,

16
00:01:02,141 --> 00:01:05,490
in my blood and I've
worked on a number of, uh,

17
00:01:05,520 --> 00:01:09,870
NASA missions and typically I work with
engineers and scientists on what it's

18
00:01:09,871 --> 00:01:14,320
like to build and send spacecraft to Mars.
Uh,

19
00:01:14,410 --> 00:01:18,630
but today I'm here with a really
interesting group of people,

20
00:01:19,120 --> 00:01:23,250
uh, people who I've had the
pleasure to work with, uh,

21
00:01:23,251 --> 00:01:26,490
for a number of years now, uh, in, uh,

22
00:01:26,491 --> 00:01:31,491
what's been a groundbreaking a television
series put on by National Geographic

23
00:01:32,430 --> 00:01:37,330
with executive producers, Ron
Howard and Brian Grazer. Uh,

24
00:01:37,440 --> 00:01:41,820
and, uh, I got to tell you,
working with these people,
it's been like, like a family.

25
00:01:42,330 --> 00:01:44,850
Uh, and for me as an engineer, uh,

26
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:47,780
perhaps the best thing
has been working with a,

27
00:01:47,790 --> 00:01:52,200
not with other engineers but
with artists and, uh, you know,

28
00:01:52,230 --> 00:01:54,780
a film studies folks,
actors,

29
00:01:54,781 --> 00:01:57,930
writers and big thinkers,
uh,

30
00:01:58,110 --> 00:02:00,780
from across the spectrum,
uh,

31
00:02:00,781 --> 00:02:03,900
that had been part of this
innovative docu drama.

32
00:02:04,140 --> 00:02:08,250
How many of you have seen any of the
episodes a season one or season two?

33
00:02:09,230 --> 00:02:11,370
Yeah, that's a good number.
That's a good number.

34
00:02:11,830 --> 00:02:15,960
It's season two's going on right now.
Uh, we just, uh, just last night,

35
00:02:16,020 --> 00:02:20,880
episode four, uh, was
premiered on Nat Geo.

36
00:02:20,950 --> 00:02:23,550
Uh, they're showing a
Monday nights, 9:00 PM.

37
00:02:23,790 --> 00:02:26,930
You can catch up with
those and you can, uh, uh,

38
00:02:26,940 --> 00:02:31,940
actually see episode five and six have
yet to come out tonight on our campus at

39
00:02:31,981 --> 00:02:35,820
cu boulder. Uh, we'll be
premiering a episode five.

40
00:02:35,821 --> 00:02:39,180
You can see it on campus a week before a,

41
00:02:39,181 --> 00:02:44,160
it'll actually be shown worldwide. Uh,
so that's what we're all here today.

42
00:02:44,161 --> 00:02:48,540
We're here for this event. Uh, and then
for this evening's event in boulder.

43
00:02:49,310 --> 00:02:50,370
Uh,
I'm here today,

44
00:02:50,610 --> 00:02:54,930
joined with a number of the
members of the show, uh,

45
00:02:54,990 --> 00:02:59,610
in various capacities, uh,
going, uh, from my, uh,

46
00:03:00,130 --> 00:03:04,480
going down this way. I
always, I always mess that up.

47
00:03:05,650 --> 00:03:09,220
My left, but it's there, right?
Let's do it that way. Uh,

48
00:03:09,880 --> 00:03:14,880
the first new corrects me the most in
my life is actually Steven Channick who,

49
00:03:15,101 --> 00:03:18,190
uh, you know, over the years
has been a great friend. Uh,

50
00:03:18,191 --> 00:03:22,600
Steven is a co executive producer
of the series, and in fact,

51
00:03:22,601 --> 00:03:25,150
the series is based on a book,
uh,

52
00:03:25,151 --> 00:03:30,151
that Steven wrote years ago about how
we will actually live and settle the

53
00:03:30,461 --> 00:03:31,840
planet Mars.
Uh,

54
00:03:31,841 --> 00:03:36,640
he's really the creative
genius behind the whole series,

55
00:03:36,700 --> 00:03:38,590
if you will, uh, through his book.

56
00:03:38,830 --> 00:03:43,300
And it's wonderful to have you here in
boulder today. Uh, next to him is Antonia.

57
00:03:43,301 --> 00:03:44,340
You Haas,
uh,

58
00:03:44,500 --> 00:03:49,250
who is an expert in oil and energy policy,
uh,

59
00:03:49,390 --> 00:03:53,950
and has written numerous papers and,
and given numerous forums on those topics,

60
00:03:54,140 --> 00:03:57,970
uh, in this series. Uh,
she's a big thinker.

61
00:03:58,240 --> 00:03:59,500
So this is a series,
right?

62
00:03:59,501 --> 00:04:04,120
That goes back and forth between the
present and the future, right? So you,

63
00:04:04,150 --> 00:04:08,590
we talk about what's happening in our
world today and then we flash forward from

64
00:04:08,591 --> 00:04:13,300
that into how that might might portray
into a human settlement of Mars in the

65
00:04:13,301 --> 00:04:14,134
future.

66
00:04:14,190 --> 00:04:19,190
And Antonio has been wonderful
in providing insights
about climate and energy,

67
00:04:20,350 --> 00:04:25,150
uh, and policy, international
policy issues here on the
earth and how those might,

68
00:04:25,180 --> 00:04:28,030
those same kind of issues
might play out on March.

69
00:04:28,690 --> 00:04:32,800
And then next to her is actually
an award winning writer, uh,

70
00:04:32,830 --> 00:04:36,460
Leonard David, uh, who, if you're
in the space community like I am,

71
00:04:36,461 --> 00:04:39,310
Leonard needs a no introductions.
Uh,

72
00:04:39,311 --> 00:04:44,311
but Leonard has written a book that
is a companion book to the National

73
00:04:44,620 --> 00:04:48,370
Geographic series. If you're
interested, you can pick one
up, uh, on the back table,

74
00:04:48,700 --> 00:04:52,780
uh, there, uh, but Leonard's book, uh, is,

75
00:04:52,781 --> 00:04:57,220
is a great companion to the series,
provides wonderful context about past,

76
00:04:57,221 --> 00:05:01,150
present, and future Mars exploration. Uh,

77
00:05:01,151 --> 00:05:06,100
and so we're here today. Uh,
what we're going to do is
we're going to, uh, watch, uh,

78
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:10,210
the trailer from season one just to
bring you up to speed about what happened

79
00:05:10,450 --> 00:05:13,080
two years ago during
season one, uh, which,

80
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:15,670
which took place in the 2030s a.

81
00:05:15,671 --> 00:05:19,420
Then we're going to show the trailer
for season two. Uh, but before I do,

82
00:05:19,421 --> 00:05:23,130
there's two other folks I definitely
want to introduce very quickly, uh,

83
00:05:23,170 --> 00:05:27,910
in the audience who will be
speaking tonight on campus.
Uh, and there are actors,

84
00:05:28,030 --> 00:05:32,740
uh, in the Nat Geo series and
that Sammy road TV, maybe Sam,

85
00:05:32,750 --> 00:05:33,650
you want to stand up?
Oh,

86
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:34,740
and Evan Hall.

87
00:05:39,560 --> 00:05:40,700
And as someone

88
00:05:40,700 --> 00:05:43,160
who's, uh, consulted, uh,

89
00:05:43,161 --> 00:05:47,810
on the show and worked with some of the
writers and actors in the production of

90
00:05:47,811 --> 00:05:52,730
the show, you know, they've
been fantastic. Uh, you
know, the, the, these guys,

91
00:05:52,731 --> 00:05:54,800
it just,
their roles are so,

92
00:05:55,340 --> 00:05:58,580
it's amazing how well they
suited into these roles.

93
00:05:59,160 --> 00:06:02,060
I know that you each have an
engineering background and you know,

94
00:06:02,061 --> 00:06:06,110
you have multiple engineering degrees
from cu boulder. I'm just kidding.

95
00:06:06,660 --> 00:06:11,650
Uh, but you know, from watching you on
the show, I mean, one would think, uh,

96
00:06:12,140 --> 00:06:16,980
that you did and it's actually
amazing. I, I spoke to you for a seat.

97
00:06:17,480 --> 00:06:21,800
Yeah. So it's been a lot of back
and forth getting ready to do that.

98
00:06:22,070 --> 00:06:27,070
But that's what's made this show I think
so unique is that it's a scientifically

99
00:06:27,201 --> 00:06:28,011
honest show.

100
00:06:28,011 --> 00:06:33,011
It's a scientifically accurate portrayal
of what the future might look like

101
00:06:33,891 --> 00:06:38,180
based on what's happening
right now, uh, in space, uh,

102
00:06:38,210 --> 00:06:42,830
exploration. Uh, so what we do
is jump into the, uh, the clips.

103
00:06:43,070 --> 00:06:47,420
The first, this is season one.
Tamara's will be risky, dangerous,

104
00:06:47,480 --> 00:06:48,560
but it will be the grease

105
00:06:48,620 --> 00:06:51,470
adventure ever,
ever in human history.

106
00:06:53,540 --> 00:06:56,420
Funny thing about Mars,
it feels like birth.

107
00:06:57,080 --> 00:07:00,530
It is more hostile to life.
Any place on earth,

108
00:07:06,530 --> 00:07:10,690
in the absence of gravity, lots of
things can go wrong. It's an unknown.

109
00:07:10,691 --> 00:07:14,230
And you're basically allowing
yourself to be an experiment.

110
00:07:15,090 --> 00:07:19,990
Well coming in too fast, landing
hazard, four and a half, just firing it.

111
00:07:26,230 --> 00:07:27,190
The question is,

112
00:07:27,580 --> 00:07:32,580
will you be able to survive during this
crucial time of arrival losing him?

113
00:07:37,710 --> 00:07:41,730
These people are putting their bodies
at risk for us, for the human race.

114
00:07:43,200 --> 00:07:47,570
When we get to Mars, we need protection
from radiation, unmanned aerial vehicles.

115
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:51,770
We use a sense of drones to find a lover
Tube with the conditions we need to

116
00:07:51,771 --> 00:07:55,440
deploy a small dam habitat and that
little foothold will become humankind's

117
00:07:55,500 --> 00:07:58,190
first real home beyond the
gravity, well, Olympus town.

118
00:07:59,030 --> 00:08:01,160
If I push this modification any farther,

119
00:08:01,220 --> 00:08:04,370
we risk overloading the entire electrical
system. We don't have a choice.

120
00:08:06,350 --> 00:08:07,450
What did you do?

121
00:08:10,380 --> 00:08:14,670
If the topography is right in the isis
there we can justify the planet can, okay,

122
00:08:14,680 --> 00:08:15,660
not scared of the dark.

123
00:08:16,700 --> 00:08:17,533
Okay.

124
00:08:21,790 --> 00:08:26,050
If there was water on Mars,
couldn't there possibly be lying?

125
00:08:32,910 --> 00:08:36,680
Medical lab is now curation.
The greenhouse is complete.

126
00:08:37,070 --> 00:08:39,650
We at MMC field that
we're ready to go faster.

127
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:43,190
Phase two expansion will be
overseen by the very best.

128
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,550
Our dream is now a reality.

129
00:08:48,310 --> 00:08:51,590
You guys up for a welcoming
committee base commander and son,

130
00:08:51,890 --> 00:08:55,500
and then two months we'll have enough
power to double the size and capacity of

131
00:08:55,501 --> 00:08:56,334
your facilities.

132
00:08:56,580 --> 00:08:59,670
It's a little too ambitious right now.
Young, go to march with that ambition.

133
00:08:59,970 --> 00:09:02,390
I don't think we didn't get a
chance to get that reaction. Okay.

134
00:09:05,180 --> 00:09:08,720
If you've got a dust storm that lasted
for a month, you'd be in big trouble.

135
00:09:08,960 --> 00:09:12,830
This asking, ranging form
up. They call it a season.

136
00:09:13,530 --> 00:09:17,450
I don't do my job. Who is going to have
a real problem is based. Ultimately,

137
00:09:17,451 --> 00:09:20,550
there are some people who are going
to have a really hard time. Well,

138
00:09:20,630 --> 00:09:24,320
I miss getting to everyone.
Are you missing home? I'm okay.

139
00:09:24,570 --> 00:09:27,570
He lifts for his work and he can't do it.

140
00:09:28,010 --> 00:09:32,740
Darling Paul Richardson
House

141
00:09:41,580 --> 00:09:44,670
has to be buried. Our friends,
the fate of the mission

142
00:09:45,540 --> 00:09:46,373
earth.

143
00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:49,410
If you send astronauts
to Mars and they die,

144
00:09:49,411 --> 00:09:52,770
their public opinion will prohibit
you from ever doing it again.

145
00:09:53,020 --> 00:09:56,230
Took them to be strong, to make a
statement that says, we're here to stay.

146
00:09:56,240 --> 00:09:59,200
Seven of the world's most beloved
scientists and astronauts are dead.

147
00:09:59,230 --> 00:10:00,850
You're not going to have
someone's plan recommendation.

148
00:10:00,930 --> 00:10:04,380
The committee when we thought
he could only get darker,

149
00:10:05,470 --> 00:10:06,380
there was flight.

150
00:10:07,950 --> 00:10:11,430
We have been talking about
life on Mars for ever.

151
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:15,550
That's like, I'm not gonna like crystal.
Have you had an iPhone? Something?

152
00:10:15,700 --> 00:10:19,390
Just think about what it would mean if
you found a single cell micro organism

153
00:10:19,580 --> 00:10:21,380
today marks the end of an era

154
00:10:23,060 --> 00:10:28,060
and the beginning of a new one here
would be so exciting to wake up in the

155
00:10:28,101 --> 00:10:32,640
morning and think that that's, that's
why it's happening. There is life on Mars

156
00:10:41,460 --> 00:10:43,730
man or been coming to Maria

157
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:52,930
would be plans for his planet.
Scientists for Galt,

158
00:10:52,990 --> 00:10:57,490
sick minus with the advancement
of Sciences. Hums industry.

159
00:10:57,820 --> 00:10:59,860
When you look after your
water and your buyer, sorry,

160
00:11:00,040 --> 00:11:04,720
I as such is becoming irrelevant on
your watch. Mars private enterprise.

161
00:11:04,750 --> 00:11:09,580
Yes. It's uncomfortable. When we
talk about what we're doing on Mars,

162
00:11:09,610 --> 00:11:13,570
we're really talking about what we
think is okay to do here on this planet.

163
00:11:13,690 --> 00:11:15,430
What's your same drill baby drill?

164
00:11:15,610 --> 00:11:19,720
I'm a Safa struck a deal with Luke from
industry hit the minus what they want.

165
00:11:19,990 --> 00:11:24,450
Yes, they're doing a job, but they also
are creating wines for themselves. Okay,

166
00:11:24,470 --> 00:11:29,040
ma'am, ma'am, I'm pregnant.
It's not like a plan. This. No,

167
00:11:29,240 --> 00:11:33,420
you just plan to leave. If we go to
Mars, you don't want any surprises.

168
00:11:33,450 --> 00:11:37,970
Does a baby is born on Mars? Could never
live here. Oh God got talking about.

169
00:11:37,980 --> 00:11:41,520
We're ahead and technology and workers
will be pushed faster than they should be

170
00:11:41,521 --> 00:11:45,480
pushed. Let me help them and those
errors have disastrous consequences.

171
00:11:47,660 --> 00:11:51,410
We cause a sense they proved just
as challenging as it does on earth.

172
00:11:52,050 --> 00:11:54,100
Do you see something?
Come on then what we're looking for,

173
00:11:54,310 --> 00:11:58,300
we think we're going to let you and your
calling. You're one crazy bitch. You know

174
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:01,570
if there's a place you've never been,

175
00:12:02,200 --> 00:12:05,740
there's a scientist wants to know what's
their companies want access to new

176
00:12:05,800 --> 00:12:07,480
territory.
At the same time,

177
00:12:07,481 --> 00:12:11,560
we have a counter movement that says
we are not going down without a fight.

178
00:12:11,710 --> 00:12:15,130
Mazda's core though is willing to
accept a much higher level of of danger.

179
00:12:15,430 --> 00:12:19,340
Solar flare.
It's taken out of electrical pride.

180
00:12:19,410 --> 00:12:22,720
Our entire communications. She could
freeze to death before we find her.

181
00:12:25,910 --> 00:12:29,990
We've disrupted the environment to
creating new conditions where diseases can

182
00:12:29,991 --> 00:12:34,930
spread. What do we got? Something at
the site has been making them sick.

183
00:12:35,380 --> 00:12:38,680
Stop the drilling.
When's governments are hiding an outbreak?

184
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:40,990
That's one of the virus is
actually, yeah, winning what?

185
00:12:42,970 --> 00:12:46,510
You'd be walking straight into the sauce.
The only one who knows this science.

186
00:12:47,470 --> 00:12:48,880
She's not breathing.
I need help.

187
00:12:52,110 --> 00:12:55,170
It's my opinion that this
colony requires new leadership

188
00:12:57,930 --> 00:13:01,910
colony just engaged and in this
town to the it or not get a chance.

189
00:13:04,450 --> 00:13:08,320
People would lie, cheat, and steal to
make sure that the mission was successful.

190
00:13:08,500 --> 00:13:11,770
Even if that costs a lot of human lives.
Take hold this

191
00:13:13,650 --> 00:13:14,483
and I'll do mine.

192
00:13:14,590 --> 00:13:17,620
They've taken advantage of us at
every turn and you let it happen.

193
00:13:18,060 --> 00:13:20,450
Will we make mistakes on Mars?
Yes.

194
00:13:22,490 --> 00:13:23,370
There's show for it.

195
00:13:23,650 --> 00:13:28,420
You see something that has unimaginable
wealth and you want to go get it and

196
00:13:28,421 --> 00:13:32,450
we're getting water today initiating
final prep before designation that comes

197
00:13:32,451 --> 00:13:35,290
with an asterisk.
Space exploration.

198
00:13:35,380 --> 00:13:38,560
It's where we solve problems that have
never been solved before for you. Okay?

199
00:13:38,561 --> 00:13:39,394
With what he's doing.

200
00:13:41,050 --> 00:13:45,940
Can you find life but not at the
expense of it. Nothing is a clean slate.

201
00:13:46,750 --> 00:13:48,430
We impose ourselves on everything.

202
00:13:52,830 --> 00:13:55,710
The future of humanity is
very much in the solar system.

203
00:13:56,160 --> 00:13:57,960
What kind of civilizations
are we going to bill?

204
00:14:08,460 --> 00:14:10,510
Ah, so what you saw there, uh,

205
00:14:10,950 --> 00:14:15,470
was it just a brief recap of
season one, which was, you know,

206
00:14:15,700 --> 00:14:18,300
all about the initial settlement. Uh, the,

207
00:14:18,360 --> 00:14:23,280
the scientific undertaking that that
initial settlement was about a basic

208
00:14:23,281 --> 00:14:28,140
survival in that settlement.
And then in season two, a,

209
00:14:28,141 --> 00:14:31,410
the expansion, the
inevitable expansion, uh,

210
00:14:31,500 --> 00:14:34,280
as industry comes in and,
uh,

211
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:38,970
some of the personal challenges and
conflicts that arise, uh, between,

212
00:14:39,180 --> 00:14:42,660
you know, science objectives
and industry objectives, um,

213
00:14:43,020 --> 00:14:45,870
many of which play out in
this world all the time, uh,

214
00:14:45,871 --> 00:14:50,020
that we are portraying in
the future on Mars. Um,

215
00:14:50,070 --> 00:14:54,710
and so with that, um, as kind of
background, we could start a Q and. A.

216
00:14:55,190 --> 00:14:57,260
Um, and so, uh,

217
00:14:57,261 --> 00:15:01,400
I actually have a question prepared
for each of the panelists. Uh,

218
00:15:01,610 --> 00:15:06,440
but um, you are welcome to
ask questions as well. Um,

219
00:15:06,920 --> 00:15:07,910
I might,
you know,

220
00:15:07,911 --> 00:15:11,090
give you a little heads up that we're
going to be asking the audience for

221
00:15:11,091 --> 00:15:14,540
questions in just a minute, but let
me start, uh, we'll just go this way.

222
00:15:14,541 --> 00:15:19,200
Let me start with you, Steven. That's
okay. Um, that's all the questions

223
00:15:20,770 --> 00:15:22,550
and we'll talk about terraforming later,

224
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:28,000
but let's start out just by talking
about what it's like for you personally,

225
00:15:30,120 --> 00:15:30,950
uh,

226
00:15:30,950 --> 00:15:35,950
to see this creation put together by this
wonderful team of actors and writers,

227
00:15:36,920 --> 00:15:40,240
producers, uh, all
based on that, you know,

228
00:15:40,250 --> 00:15:42,530
relatively small book that you wrote,

229
00:15:42,650 --> 00:15:46,910
very important but small in size,
a book that you wrote.

230
00:15:47,500 --> 00:15:48,350
Uh,
how's that,

231
00:15:48,560 --> 00:15:53,330
how's that feel and how do you think the
portrayal has gone in terms of accuracy?

232
00:15:56,190 --> 00:16:00,320
Good. Um, well, what's
the big shock? I've been,

233
00:16:00,321 --> 00:16:03,800
I'm a science journalist
my whole life and, um,

234
00:16:04,610 --> 00:16:09,610
and I've never been kind of buffered
up against the Hollywood syndrome.

235
00:16:11,180 --> 00:16:16,180
So when we first got involved in this
project and the book was first optioned by

236
00:16:16,341 --> 00:16:18,020
radical media,
um,

237
00:16:18,140 --> 00:16:20,720
there were all kinds of twists
and turns that were kind of crazy.

238
00:16:21,270 --> 00:16:25,380
I'm like getting space x
to cooperate with us. Um,

239
00:16:25,460 --> 00:16:28,760
which was a very difficult
problem initially. Um,

240
00:16:29,930 --> 00:16:34,930
and then seeing how this concept of
storytelling was far more important to

241
00:16:36,561 --> 00:16:41,390
anyone in on the west coast than the
facts where to anyone on the east coast

242
00:16:41,450 --> 00:16:45,740
where I was. So there was kind of
this thing going on between us and,

243
00:16:46,010 --> 00:16:51,010
and my role quickly became not just
explaining as was Bobby's role,

244
00:16:52,970 --> 00:16:57,550
uh, initially and in the show,
not just explaining to the film,

245
00:16:57,580 --> 00:16:59,660
making people in the actors and so forth,

246
00:17:00,290 --> 00:17:03,650
what the real facts were about being
on Mars and the kinds of scenarios you

247
00:17:03,651 --> 00:17:05,210
could have. And you
couldn't have, for example,

248
00:17:05,211 --> 00:17:10,140
I will never forget a phone
call from the director, um, uh,

249
00:17:10,190 --> 00:17:12,950
in the first season.
And we were talking about,

250
00:17:12,980 --> 00:17:16,970
I'm actually leaving earth and going to
Mars and the trip. And they said, okay,

251
00:17:16,971 --> 00:17:19,550
somebody's got to die on this.
How are they going to die?

252
00:17:20,900 --> 00:17:24,380
So I gave him like five scenarios from
my favorite scenario was that a small

253
00:17:24,381 --> 00:17:28,880
meteoroid, um, would pass through
the rocket and they said, no,

254
00:17:28,881 --> 00:17:31,700
we don't like that. And then I gave
him a couple of other scenarios.

255
00:17:31,960 --> 00:17:35,750
Now we don't like that and a game a couple
of days, no, I don't like that. And uh,

256
00:17:35,870 --> 00:17:40,610
it was like, well, wait a
minute, you know, um, what
kind of scenario do you want?

257
00:17:40,670 --> 00:17:45,170
And they would give me one and I would
say that isn't physically possible in

258
00:17:45,171 --> 00:17:50,130
space. So, um, initially
there was, there was,

259
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:53,100
there was a lot of, you
know, conflict of buffering.

260
00:17:53,220 --> 00:17:58,220
I'm trying to come up trying to get the
people who wanted to do the storytelling

261
00:17:58,470 --> 00:18:00,960
and we're very good at it,
um,

262
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:04,470
to adapt to the physical
realities of the universe.

263
00:18:06,510 --> 00:18:09,030
But in the end it worked
out great. And, um,

264
00:18:09,300 --> 00:18:13,290
one of the things that really surprised
me was that both the actors and the

265
00:18:13,291 --> 00:18:17,160
directors, um, we're
really eager to learn.

266
00:18:17,340 --> 00:18:21,030
Like when I first met the
initial group of actors,

267
00:18:21,060 --> 00:18:22,590
every single one of
them had read the book.

268
00:18:22,591 --> 00:18:24,510
Some of them had read the
book two or three times.

269
00:18:24,930 --> 00:18:28,110
And the book served as kind of a primer
because it kind of laid out all the

270
00:18:28,111 --> 00:18:30,720
facts of, you know, what
it would be like on Mars,

271
00:18:30,930 --> 00:18:33,210
what it would be like getting
there, what are, you know,

272
00:18:33,580 --> 00:18:37,410
it's very science based and very
fact based. And they really,

273
00:18:37,590 --> 00:18:40,920
they really absorbed that
and wanted to learn that.

274
00:18:41,460 --> 00:18:45,090
So it's been a lot of fun.
Um,

275
00:18:45,091 --> 00:18:47,940
Anna and I've learned an awful lot,
you know,

276
00:18:47,941 --> 00:18:52,941
I thought as a journalist and as a
writer and as an editor and you know,

277
00:18:53,040 --> 00:18:54,290
I used to be a,
um,

278
00:18:54,630 --> 00:18:59,070
kind of a writer's editor who worked with
really long form kind of stories that

279
00:18:59,071 --> 00:18:59,370
you would,

280
00:18:59,370 --> 00:19:03,000
the kind of stories you would see in the
New Yorker or the New York Times Sunday

281
00:19:03,001 --> 00:19:04,470
magazine.
You know,

282
00:19:04,471 --> 00:19:08,340
I thought I knew everything that I
was ever going to need to know about

283
00:19:08,341 --> 00:19:13,200
storytelling and this new
dimension, which is visual, um,

284
00:19:13,230 --> 00:19:17,190
taught me an awful lot and it taught
me an awful lot about scene setting and

285
00:19:17,191 --> 00:19:22,191
words as well as sin in visuals
and carrying through a storyline.

286
00:19:22,291 --> 00:19:25,830
So, um, I'm very grateful for the whole.

287
00:19:26,070 --> 00:19:30,670
All right. Thank you.
Thanks a Antonio. Uh,

288
00:19:30,790 --> 00:19:35,520
first of all, welcome back to boulder.
You're a hometown from here. Nice. Yeah.

289
00:19:36,370 --> 00:19:37,630
Great. Yeah. Um,

290
00:19:37,960 --> 00:19:42,960
you play a extremely important role in
season two as one of the big thinkers.

291
00:19:43,430 --> 00:19:47,190
Uh, and, and in fact your
insights in the show, you know,

292
00:19:47,230 --> 00:19:50,320
personally I have found
fascinating, um, you know,

293
00:19:50,321 --> 00:19:53,800
the drilling on Mars,
drilling on earth and you know,

294
00:19:53,801 --> 00:19:57,970
kind of parallels and
challenges. Uh, in that vein,

295
00:19:58,600 --> 00:20:02,320
can you talk a little
bit more about how you,

296
00:20:02,620 --> 00:20:04,000
how you view what we've,

297
00:20:04,180 --> 00:20:08,050
what we're doing today presently
to the earth and on the earth,

298
00:20:08,440 --> 00:20:12,420
how you view that playing out,
uh, in the future on Mars? Sure.

299
00:20:13,240 --> 00:20:15,400
Yeah, it is great to be home.
I live in San Francisco now,

300
00:20:15,401 --> 00:20:16,211
but I grew up in boulder,

301
00:20:16,211 --> 00:20:19,300
so it's really great to be back
here and see the brand new campus.

302
00:20:19,301 --> 00:20:22,960
And thanks for all of you for being here.
So as you saw on the previews,

303
00:20:23,230 --> 00:20:24,460
what's really exciting,

304
00:20:24,820 --> 00:20:28,270
one of the things that's really exciting
about the show is I do think this model

305
00:20:28,300 --> 00:20:32,530
is entirely unique and, uh, just
revolutionary way of storytelling,

306
00:20:32,830 --> 00:20:36,910
which is the hybrid of the documentary
and the drama. So they're interlaced,

307
00:20:36,911 --> 00:20:37,590
as you saw it,

308
00:20:37,590 --> 00:20:40,960
you've got the dramatic series in the
future on Mars and then you have the

309
00:20:40,961 --> 00:20:44,460
documentary and you go back
and forth between the two.

310
00:20:44,461 --> 00:20:49,300
And both sets become characters in a way.
Like you want to know, I think, what,

311
00:20:49,330 --> 00:20:51,490
not only what's going to happen
to the characters in the drama,

312
00:20:51,700 --> 00:20:55,300
but what the next big thinker is going
to say because you also become invested

313
00:20:55,301 --> 00:20:57,430
in them. Cause they're
carried through the storyline,

314
00:20:57,730 --> 00:21:00,900
the documentary storyline as well.
But in the first season,

315
00:21:00,910 --> 00:21:03,180
the documentary is basically about,
you know,

316
00:21:03,190 --> 00:21:05,770
the science of getting to
Mars in the second season.

317
00:21:05,771 --> 00:21:09,530
The documentary is really about,
um,

318
00:21:10,180 --> 00:21:14,620
what are the unforeseen consequences
that we've treated as unforeseen

319
00:21:14,621 --> 00:21:16,180
consequences on earth.

320
00:21:16,420 --> 00:21:21,420
That has led us to a devastation of our
ability to cohabitate with this planet.

321
00:21:21,760 --> 00:21:24,170
And will we follow those same,
uh,

322
00:21:24,250 --> 00:21:28,990
failures as we go to the next planet
and trying to learn those lessons.

323
00:21:28,991 --> 00:21:31,210
And that's basically, you
know, from my perspective,

324
00:21:31,211 --> 00:21:33,730
or at least my role in the
documentary and my role is about,

325
00:21:34,060 --> 00:21:38,260
is looking at the failure of
resource extraction on earth.

326
00:21:39,070 --> 00:21:44,070
And will the failure of resource
extraction on earth be carried forward.

327
00:21:45,310 --> 00:21:49,750
And the failure of resource extraction
on earth is really well embodied in oil

328
00:21:49,751 --> 00:21:52,320
extraction. And so that's sort of the
tool that's followed in season two.

329
00:21:52,320 --> 00:21:53,153
As you saw,

330
00:21:53,510 --> 00:21:58,510
green peace is followed as they go head
to head with oil drilling in the Arctic

331
00:21:59,680 --> 00:22:02,010
with the outcome of oil drilling,
um,

332
00:22:02,260 --> 00:22:05,890
in the small peninsula of the Russian
Arctic and in the drilling platform and

333
00:22:05,891 --> 00:22:08,740
the Norwegian Arctic.
Um,

334
00:22:09,070 --> 00:22:10,960
and you know,

335
00:22:10,961 --> 00:22:15,961
I think what is really some of the
crux of the storyline and how I have

336
00:22:16,781 --> 00:22:21,781
summarized the two seasons from my
own perspective is the first season is

337
00:22:22,571 --> 00:22:27,400
looking at Willmar's kill the humans
that go there. And the second season is,

338
00:22:27,401 --> 00:22:28,660
well,
the humans kill Mars.

339
00:22:29,950 --> 00:22:32,800
And that is looking at what's,

340
00:22:32,830 --> 00:22:36,730
what's going to happen when and if this,
um,

341
00:22:36,760 --> 00:22:41,760
major industry comes and the depiction
of the industry in lucrum industries,

342
00:22:43,870 --> 00:22:44,703
um,

343
00:22:44,830 --> 00:22:49,420
is really incredibly spot on in the way
it's written in the portrayal of the

344
00:22:49,421 --> 00:22:53,980
actors in the difficulties they face.
And the,

345
00:22:53,981 --> 00:22:58,960
and the decision to, um,
you know, as, um, Jeff, uh,

346
00:22:58,990 --> 00:23:03,220
who, who's the actor in the clip says,
you know, drill baby, drill quoting,

347
00:23:03,221 --> 00:23:07,300
Sarah Pailin. Um, and,

348
00:23:07,780 --> 00:23:12,280
and I think that the lessons are really
well embodied in both sets of stories.

349
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:17,380
Um, one of the critical issues that's
raised, you know, is there life on Mars,

350
00:23:17,920 --> 00:23:21,590
one of the big challenges that happens
with oil drilling, um, what, what, what,

351
00:23:21,591 --> 00:23:23,920
what one sees over and over and
over again with oil drilling.

352
00:23:23,921 --> 00:23:28,921
The history of the last 150 years of
oil drilling is the drilling goes first.

353
00:23:29,261 --> 00:23:32,410
And only afterwards that we then learn,
oh wait,

354
00:23:32,411 --> 00:23:34,890
there was this really
critical natural resource. Uh,

355
00:23:34,900 --> 00:23:37,930
there was this group of people
who lived here. Um, you know,

356
00:23:37,931 --> 00:23:42,070
there were all sorts of consequences that
only get thought of as an afterthought.

357
00:23:42,610 --> 00:23:46,250
And one of the best examples
of that in Arctic drilling,

358
00:23:46,430 --> 00:23:50,390
which I think is a good parallel to what
could happen on Mars is something that

359
00:23:50,391 --> 00:23:53,090
seems really inconsequential.
And that's phyto plankton.

360
00:23:53,091 --> 00:23:56,780
It just looks like a seaweed,
but it turns out that phyto plankton,

361
00:23:56,781 --> 00:24:00,680
if you destroy it, it provides 50% of
the oxygen we need to live on the planet.

362
00:24:01,070 --> 00:24:06,020
So treating it as a sort
of inconsequential thing
is one of the reasons why

363
00:24:06,021 --> 00:24:08,840
we're facing the problem
that we're facing right now.

364
00:24:09,170 --> 00:24:12,050
And so trying to learn the lesson,
which is

365
00:24:13,700 --> 00:24:17,480
maybe, um, consider
the consequences first,

366
00:24:17,481 --> 00:24:22,430
longterm consequences first,
and just go, you know, go in,

367
00:24:23,630 --> 00:24:27,970
uh, it go in second
with the, uh, you know,

368
00:24:27,980 --> 00:24:29,420
blind pursuit of the,

369
00:24:29,960 --> 00:24:34,400
of the resource. That's great. Yeah.
Thank you. Thank you. Uh, Leonard.

370
00:24:34,940 --> 00:24:39,860
So, um, you know, great for you to
be here today, Leonard. Uh, so, uh,

371
00:24:40,820 --> 00:24:44,870
you know, our interaction
dates back to actual, you know,

372
00:24:44,990 --> 00:24:46,490
space flight missions,
right?

373
00:24:46,491 --> 00:24:50,820
And I'm typically used to seeing
Leonard David articles written, uh,

374
00:24:51,120 --> 00:24:54,380
about insight or about Mars 2020.

375
00:24:54,480 --> 00:24:59,480
So I spelled his name right all the way
back to Mars Pathfinder in the nineties.

376
00:24:59,930 --> 00:25:00,530
Right.

377
00:25:00,530 --> 00:25:05,090
So I'm very interested in
your opinion of this show,

378
00:25:05,091 --> 00:25:07,890
which is a portrayal of a future mission,
uh,

379
00:25:07,910 --> 00:25:11,350
because I know that you've
very accurately covered, uh,

380
00:25:11,490 --> 00:25:14,870
so many existing missions. Uh,
can you comment on that briefly?

381
00:25:14,910 --> 00:25:17,590
Well, you know, I think one thing,

382
00:25:17,591 --> 00:25:21,030
it strikes me the drill baby
drill thing before I forget,

383
00:25:21,540 --> 00:25:24,090
that's also a Christmas k line.

384
00:25:24,091 --> 00:25:28,680
He's a Mars scientist and he wants a
drill subsurface to look for life to look

385
00:25:28,681 --> 00:25:33,540
for. So it's, um, and the
atmosphere is changing. I love that.

386
00:25:34,160 --> 00:25:34,740
Um,

387
00:25:34,740 --> 00:25:39,740
subtitle because this morning I
got up and I looked at insight.

388
00:25:41,161 --> 00:25:45,640
We just landed on Mars few days ago.
Uh,

389
00:25:45,830 --> 00:25:49,530
Cyrus racks pulls up at
an asteroid yesterday.

390
00:25:51,060 --> 00:25:55,950
The Japanese space agency has a, uh,
another asteroid mission that's uh,

391
00:25:56,460 --> 00:26:01,170
uh, also on, on target. Three
people left the earth the other day.

392
00:26:01,171 --> 00:26:03,630
They hedge to the space station.
Um,

393
00:26:04,290 --> 00:26:06,520
space x just hurled out,
you know,

394
00:26:06,630 --> 00:26:11,460
60 some satellites out at one rocket
and then flew the, boosts your back.

395
00:26:11,950 --> 00:26:13,980
And I think that's atmosphere changing.

396
00:26:14,010 --> 00:26:18,150
I've never seen so much
activity in the last week,

397
00:26:19,220 --> 00:26:24,060
uh, and in something something's going
on here, and it's not just the NASA,

398
00:26:24,061 --> 00:26:26,550
but it's,
it's a global effort.

399
00:26:27,360 --> 00:26:31,090
And when you think about what's
coming for Mars, we have, uh,

400
00:26:31,550 --> 00:26:36,450
a Mars 20, 20, the NASA
super cute curiosity rover,

401
00:26:36,620 --> 00:26:39,930
um, that'll take off. And the 20,

402
00:26:39,931 --> 00:26:44,850
20 a China's going to launch
a Mars mission of robotic
mission, same time period.

403
00:26:45,510 --> 00:26:49,200
Uh, the UAE,

404
00:26:49,201 --> 00:26:53,070
they're going to be launching
a Mars orbiter. Um, uh,

405
00:26:53,220 --> 00:26:58,140
it's absolutely incredible what's
happening. And Mars is, you know,

406
00:26:58,141 --> 00:27:00,990
it's, it's dangerous. It's,
it's destiny. You know, for me,

407
00:27:00,991 --> 00:27:05,710
I've always felt that Mars
was a, from a kid, uh,

408
00:27:05,730 --> 00:27:09,930
covering early Mars missions, uh, Viking,

409
00:27:09,960 --> 00:27:13,020
particularly in 1976.
That was just a thrill.

410
00:27:13,380 --> 00:27:16,640
The first pictures come back
and of course you're looking,

411
00:27:16,680 --> 00:27:20,370
you want to see rabbits running
around up there and whatever.

412
00:27:20,940 --> 00:27:23,850
And I just remember the one guy,
I think it was a,

413
00:27:25,050 --> 00:27:29,910
I can't remember his name now, but he,
there's rocks there have rocks on Mars.

414
00:27:30,630 --> 00:27:35,160
Okay. Not quite rabbits, but
it was good enough for me.

415
00:27:35,430 --> 00:27:40,230
But yeah, the whole, the, you know,
the future is now, I just, I, I really,

416
00:27:40,310 --> 00:27:44,160
uh, honesty got last in
the last week and a half.

417
00:27:44,760 --> 00:27:49,320
How many things have happened?
Unbelievable. Okay. That's true.

418
00:27:49,500 --> 00:27:54,160
Um, I mean it's a, it's a whole new era
of space exploration right now. Yeah. Uh,

419
00:27:54,180 --> 00:27:57,150
in the U S it's not only the
government, right? There's companies,

420
00:27:57,640 --> 00:28:02,190
they're doing things on their
own. It's incredible. Um, so, um,

421
00:28:02,520 --> 00:28:06,420
let's, let's see what kind of
questions you all have for us. Um,

422
00:28:07,050 --> 00:28:08,130
anybody want to go first?

423
00:28:09,100 --> 00:28:09,933
Okay.

424
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:11,380
Uh,
less of a technology question,

425
00:28:11,381 --> 00:28:15,220
but I was just curious that where you
do the majority of your filming and how

426
00:28:15,221 --> 00:28:18,370
much is CGI versus how much
is the actual physical sets?

427
00:28:19,180 --> 00:28:24,010
There's a $15 million worth
of sets in Budapest right now.

428
00:28:24,040 --> 00:28:27,010
They're all packaged up.
They were in a,

429
00:28:28,600 --> 00:28:30,970
a container building,
um,

430
00:28:30,971 --> 00:28:35,230
is typical of Hollywood sets that you
could have parked about seven and seven.

431
00:28:35,231 --> 00:28:36,220
47,
10.

432
00:28:36,720 --> 00:28:37,553
MMM.

433
00:28:38,350 --> 00:28:43,030
Built the largest green screen ever in
the history of movie making so that we

434
00:28:43,031 --> 00:28:47,050
could go to Morocco and
photograph where rovers,

435
00:28:47,110 --> 00:28:49,930
Nasa Rovers who tested because
it actually looks like,

436
00:28:50,200 --> 00:28:53,860
and it was a lot like the surface of Mars.
Then project that on the screen,

437
00:28:53,861 --> 00:28:56,020
then have the actors in
front of that screen.

438
00:28:56,500 --> 00:28:59,260
That's kind of remarkable
stuff that they've done.

439
00:28:59,261 --> 00:29:01,960
They built full size sets
for the first season.

440
00:29:02,710 --> 00:29:04,870
When I was walking through the sets,
I mean you,

441
00:29:04,960 --> 00:29:09,960
you really can begin to think you're
on Mars and just a few minutes because

442
00:29:10,031 --> 00:29:12,250
it's,
things are so realistic.

443
00:29:12,251 --> 00:29:17,110
Down to there was a little container
in a hallway and the sets and the first

444
00:29:17,111 --> 00:29:21,400
season on Mars and I picked it up and
looked at it and it was his container that

445
00:29:21,401 --> 00:29:25,180
supposedly something had been brought
to Marson and it had like six different

446
00:29:25,181 --> 00:29:29,700
labels on it, you know, approved by
inspectors such and such, uh, and,

447
00:29:29,760 --> 00:29:31,360
and Houston and stuff like that.

448
00:29:31,360 --> 00:29:35,230
I mean down to the level that the
camera would never pick up. Um,

449
00:29:35,380 --> 00:29:40,380
the sets were so elaborate and so exacting
because it allows the actors to get

450
00:29:40,871 --> 00:29:44,980
into role and really feel
like that there. So, um, we,

451
00:29:45,610 --> 00:29:48,340
we unfortunately lost
our spot in Budapest.

452
00:29:48,341 --> 00:29:53,341
Budapest has now become a very popular
place to make movies in many movies that

453
00:29:53,921 --> 00:29:58,720
you think are British or American or
actually made in Budapest these days. And,

454
00:29:58,721 --> 00:30:01,280
uh, we're probably gonna
move to Bucharest for the,

455
00:30:01,390 --> 00:30:04,240
for the next season if there's
a next season. But, um,

456
00:30:04,720 --> 00:30:07,660
because it's cheaper to make
films there, but, uh, the,

457
00:30:08,500 --> 00:30:12,850
it's pretty elaborate stuff, you know,
it's the stuff of making real movies,

458
00:30:13,310 --> 00:30:15,730
um,
as opposed to just a documentary series.

459
00:30:15,731 --> 00:30:19,930
So the investment in this
has been extraordinary. I
think for the first season,

460
00:30:19,931 --> 00:30:23,740
the sets where there were $5 million
worth of sets and for the second season

461
00:30:24,010 --> 00:30:27,610
they had another $10 million from
the sets and they, the second season,

462
00:30:27,611 --> 00:30:31,570
the sets are just huge compared
to the first season. So,

463
00:30:31,660 --> 00:30:35,950
and I think if there's a third and a
fourth season, it will grow in that way.

464
00:30:37,120 --> 00:30:42,100
Who Decides on that? How does, how
does that happen? Vice President said,

465
00:30:42,101 --> 00:30:42,934
Fox

466
00:30:46,500 --> 00:30:47,350
question in the middle there.

467
00:30:48,220 --> 00:30:52,060
So we've been imagining Mars colonization
for years and years and years.

468
00:30:52,340 --> 00:30:54,130
I'm thinking about today,

469
00:30:54,280 --> 00:30:58,840
what things on challenges
had we anticipated before
and that we're now better

470
00:30:58,841 --> 00:30:59,680
able to deal with?

471
00:30:59,710 --> 00:31:04,330
And what new challenges have we discovered
that we didn't foresee back then?

472
00:31:05,500 --> 00:31:08,500
That's probably for you. Well, I'll start,

473
00:31:08,530 --> 00:31:11,650
but you can always add in a,
so I would,

474
00:31:12,160 --> 00:31:17,160
I would argue that we've made great
progress in determining how to land big

475
00:31:18,251 --> 00:31:20,950
things on Mars.
So a,

476
00:31:20,951 --> 00:31:25,090
and this is an area that I've
worked in most of my career. Um,

477
00:31:25,120 --> 00:31:28,060
and if you had asked me 10 years ago,

478
00:31:28,240 --> 00:31:33,060
you know how we were gonna land humans
on Mars, I would have said know, I dunno.

479
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:37,960
Um, there were a lot of ideas out there
10 years ago or even 20 years ago.

480
00:31:37,961 --> 00:31:42,610
There were a lot of kind
of cartoon drawings that
showed how one might do that,

481
00:31:43,240 --> 00:31:46,910
but none of that technology
had been proven. Uh,

482
00:31:47,080 --> 00:31:50,590
and recently I'm actually
here on the earth.

483
00:31:50,620 --> 00:31:54,430
We've done a lot to prove
those technologies. So,

484
00:31:54,431 --> 00:31:59,020
one example would be, um, you
know, when space ex, uh, returns,

485
00:31:59,021 --> 00:32:03,370
the first stage boosters that they've
done successfully over 30 times,

486
00:32:03,371 --> 00:32:06,550
now a way up high in the atmosphere,

487
00:32:06,580 --> 00:32:08,470
when they're bringing that booster back,

488
00:32:08,471 --> 00:32:12,700
they call out something called
an entry burn. And that burn, uh,

489
00:32:12,710 --> 00:32:17,710
takes place supersonically in Mars
relevant conditions because you're up so

490
00:32:18,191 --> 00:32:18,461
high,

491
00:32:18,461 --> 00:32:23,461
you're up around 100,000 feet or higher
when that burned takes place and a,

492
00:32:23,891 --> 00:32:28,150
what they're doing is they're,
they're firing their jets, uh,

493
00:32:28,300 --> 00:32:32,200
in opposite to the direction of the
velocity. So opposing free stream,

494
00:32:33,040 --> 00:32:35,950
uh, and that's something that actually
people have talked about a lot,

495
00:32:35,951 --> 00:32:38,530
but until space x had a need to do that,

496
00:32:39,080 --> 00:32:42,740
no one had ever done that in Mars
relevant conditions. And as I've said,

497
00:32:42,741 --> 00:32:45,110
they've done it for a
big piece of hardware.

498
00:32:45,650 --> 00:32:48,230
They've done it 30 times
or more successfully.

499
00:32:48,590 --> 00:32:52,190
You don't see that because it happens so
high. You see the booster coming down,

500
00:32:52,420 --> 00:32:56,690
you know, right on the drone
ship. And that's exciting too. Uh,

501
00:32:56,691 --> 00:32:59,690
but for those of us that are
focused on Mars, we all work.

502
00:32:59,750 --> 00:33:04,520
We care about what happened at 40
kilometers or so out to, to uh,

503
00:33:04,521 --> 00:33:07,160
also at, through the robotic
program. I mean, you know,

504
00:33:07,161 --> 00:33:12,161
I started my career by landing
Mars Pathfinder on the surface.

505
00:33:12,950 --> 00:33:16,790
It landed a little rover called sojourner
that was about the size of a baby.

506
00:33:17,210 --> 00:33:21,330
It weighed, it was 11 kilograms
in mass. And you know, uh,

507
00:33:21,410 --> 00:33:25,100
Mars science laboratory is the
size of a small car, right?

508
00:33:25,101 --> 00:33:29,840
It's a nuclear powered car
with a laser on it, right?

509
00:33:29,850 --> 00:33:34,640
Then we landed in 2012 and
that, uh, by the way in 2020,

510
00:33:34,641 --> 00:33:37,040
we're going to land much more accurately.

511
00:33:37,340 --> 00:33:42,340
We're going to land basically
in a football field instead
of in a 20 kilometer

512
00:33:42,890 --> 00:33:46,190
safe zone. So, um, you know, and that,

513
00:33:46,191 --> 00:33:50,290
that kind of accuracy is required to
build up a base camp, right? If you,

514
00:33:50,690 --> 00:33:53,990
in the series you see that
there've been many landings and,

515
00:33:54,050 --> 00:33:55,880
and in order to build up this base camp,

516
00:33:55,881 --> 00:34:00,370
those many landings have to happen in
close proximity to each other to get all

517
00:34:00,390 --> 00:34:04,550
that hardware together. Uh, and that's
a technology that we're improving.

518
00:34:05,150 --> 00:34:09,260
Uh, I think our ability
to keep people, you know,

519
00:34:09,440 --> 00:34:12,920
alive frankly, and to keep them
safe so that they can live,

520
00:34:12,921 --> 00:34:15,410
play and work in space.
Uh,

521
00:34:15,650 --> 00:34:19,580
both in the micro gravity environment
of space and on another planet has been

522
00:34:19,581 --> 00:34:23,570
greatly enhanced by what we're doing on
the international space station today.

523
00:34:24,010 --> 00:34:26,480
A lender and mentioned the
three astronauts that just went,

524
00:34:26,481 --> 00:34:29,900
but they joined three others that
are already there. And you know,

525
00:34:29,901 --> 00:34:32,180
we've had people,
you know,

526
00:34:32,181 --> 00:34:37,181
from our planet in space continuously
since 2001 think about that.

527
00:34:38,870 --> 00:34:41,320
Not the same people,
but uh,

528
00:34:42,680 --> 00:34:46,340
I mean that's a remarkable
achievement for our planet.

529
00:34:46,820 --> 00:34:48,350
And it's not just Americans,
right?

530
00:34:48,351 --> 00:34:51,680
They're international
astronauts included in that.

531
00:34:52,880 --> 00:34:56,450
And to think that we've lived
off of our world continuously,

532
00:34:56,480 --> 00:35:01,480
some smallest subset of us have done
so continuously and safely since 2001 a

533
00:35:04,130 --> 00:35:07,100
that tells you something about
the reliability of the system.

534
00:35:07,130 --> 00:35:11,810
The cruise systems needed to keep
people safe about food processing,

535
00:35:11,811 --> 00:35:14,300
about water processing,
radiation shielding,

536
00:35:14,750 --> 00:35:19,010
all of the kinds of technologies that
you see played out in this series.

537
00:35:19,490 --> 00:35:20,810
They're happening today.

538
00:35:21,560 --> 00:35:24,320
And then the last piece that I'll mention
and I'll see if you want to add to

539
00:35:24,321 --> 00:35:26,900
that is,
is really correct.

540
00:35:27,100 --> 00:35:32,000
It is just the advancement of
industry, frankly in this country. Uh,

541
00:35:32,190 --> 00:35:34,330
it's one thing for our government,
uh,

542
00:35:34,490 --> 00:35:38,180
to be talking about sending humans
back to the, it's great, you know,

543
00:35:38,260 --> 00:35:40,920
exciting thing. Um, you know,

544
00:35:40,921 --> 00:35:45,780
to repeat something like the
Apollo missions from the 1960s,

545
00:35:46,140 --> 00:35:49,380
you know, it would be a fantastic
achievement for our country,

546
00:35:49,950 --> 00:35:54,950
but what really impresses me and gets
me going gets my juices going is the

547
00:35:55,861 --> 00:36:00,861
industry capabilities in this country
at places like space x or you know,

548
00:36:00,931 --> 00:36:05,850
right here in Colorado at Lockheed
Martin, uh, or what's going on,

549
00:36:05,851 --> 00:36:09,450
you know, with blue origin
or virgin galactic, uh,

550
00:36:09,451 --> 00:36:14,451
all of these companies that are on their
own contributing to the space economy,

551
00:36:15,270 --> 00:36:17,310
uh, planet labs that, you know,

552
00:36:17,580 --> 00:36:22,380
is basically building almost a
real time Google earth. Right?

553
00:36:23,070 --> 00:36:24,180
Um, I, you know,

554
00:36:24,181 --> 00:36:28,920
it's remarkable what's happening in space
today and I think that capability is

555
00:36:28,921 --> 00:36:33,690
required for us to efficiently
and cost effectively,

556
00:36:34,050 --> 00:36:35,070
uh,
go to Mars.

557
00:36:36,730 --> 00:36:40,140
I think from a tactical point of view
of one of the most interesting things

558
00:36:40,141 --> 00:36:44,610
about going to Mars is that most of the
technology that you needed to do this

559
00:36:44,611 --> 00:36:48,360
has been available for at least 30 years.
So I like to say 40 years,

560
00:36:48,361 --> 00:36:51,270
but probably 30 years. Um, there's a,

561
00:36:51,300 --> 00:36:56,040
there's a device on the new curiosity
rover that's going up in 2020 called Moxie

562
00:36:56,370 --> 00:37:01,370
that we'll split the carbon atom off
this CO2 atmosphere of Mars and create

563
00:37:01,741 --> 00:37:05,170
enough oxygen, um, for uh,

564
00:37:05,580 --> 00:37:08,610
one human being to breathe consistently.
For example,

565
00:37:08,630 --> 00:37:11,430
that machine is supposed to be scaled,

566
00:37:11,520 --> 00:37:14,130
is designed to be scaled up
by a factor of a hundred.

567
00:37:14,131 --> 00:37:19,131
I think NASA originally
wanted that machine so that
they could have an oxidizer

568
00:37:19,500 --> 00:37:23,700
on Mars to make rocket fuel for
a return trip in the future.

569
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:24,571
But in fact,

570
00:37:24,571 --> 00:37:28,110
that machine is probably going to turn
out to be the machine that makes the

571
00:37:28,111 --> 00:37:30,570
oxygen that people need
to breathe on Mars.

572
00:37:30,780 --> 00:37:34,110
I'm not quite sure what they're going to
use for the rest of them in their gas.

573
00:37:34,111 --> 00:37:38,490
The other 78%,
that is still a technical problem.

574
00:37:38,491 --> 00:37:41,730
But what's amazing is that all this stuff,
you know,

575
00:37:41,731 --> 00:37:46,680
we made this decision to
stay in earth orbit a long,

576
00:37:46,681 --> 00:37:47,610
long time ago.

577
00:37:47,611 --> 00:37:51,240
It's the Apollo program was coming to
an end and we decided to build a space

578
00:37:51,241 --> 00:37:51,541
shuttle,

579
00:37:51,541 --> 00:37:54,990
which is supposed to be cheap and
reusable and it turned out to cost about

580
00:37:55,050 --> 00:37:57,390
doubled over a billion
dollars for each flight.

581
00:37:57,720 --> 00:38:02,720
And we have not kind of reached out and
extended what we're capable of doing.

582
00:38:03,330 --> 00:38:06,330
We haven't gone back to the moon,
which I think would be kind of a waste,

583
00:38:06,331 --> 00:38:07,470
but we haven't,

584
00:38:07,560 --> 00:38:12,560
we haven't taken a bold step like we did
in the Apollo program and decided to,

585
00:38:12,960 --> 00:38:14,700
let's just go to Maurice because we've,

586
00:38:14,790 --> 00:38:17,610
and yet we've had this capability
to do this for so long.

587
00:38:18,390 --> 00:38:21,870
And to touch on one other thing that
both Leonard and Bobby have touched on

588
00:38:22,260 --> 00:38:24,150
spaces.
The next big business,

589
00:38:24,180 --> 00:38:28,020
it isn't an accident that you see all
these things happening in, in the,

590
00:38:28,021 --> 00:38:29,250
in the last week or so,

591
00:38:29,580 --> 00:38:33,650
the Russians have committed to going
to Mars and putting a human on Omar.

592
00:38:33,870 --> 00:38:36,700
The Chinese have to
putting a human on Mars.

593
00:38:36,970 --> 00:38:41,560
Both the Russians and the Chinese have
committed to put humans on the moon again.

594
00:38:41,790 --> 00:38:46,090
Uh, NASA has committed just recently
to putting humans on the moon again.

595
00:38:46,640 --> 00:38:49,240
Um,
and yet as Bobby says,

596
00:38:49,270 --> 00:38:52,090
there are all these private
companies that could actually do it.

597
00:38:52,120 --> 00:38:56,200
Maybe even before any of these governments
could do it. Companies like space x,

598
00:38:56,350 --> 00:38:59,560
which actually intend to do it
before a government does it.

599
00:38:59,890 --> 00:39:02,340
This is the next big business,
you know,

600
00:39:02,410 --> 00:39:05,770
lassoing the SLS launch system and the,

601
00:39:06,160 --> 00:39:08,840
and the Orion capsule on that.
NASA has built,

602
00:39:09,520 --> 00:39:13,150
one of the original things they wanted
to do with that literally was the go out

603
00:39:13,180 --> 00:39:17,290
and find a near Earth asteroids and
Lasso it and bring it back and put it in

604
00:39:17,291 --> 00:39:21,100
orbit around the moon so that commercial
companies could practice mining it.

605
00:39:21,730 --> 00:39:22,690
That's real.

606
00:39:22,720 --> 00:39:27,720
That's real technology that we have now
that we're capable of doing this is it's

607
00:39:28,120 --> 00:39:33,120
just going to be mind blowing how this
stuff expands and it's expanding a lot

608
00:39:34,301 --> 00:39:36,700
because of the commercial
aspects of space.

609
00:39:36,850 --> 00:39:38,560
It's really going to be a big business.

610
00:39:39,680 --> 00:39:43,170
Yeah. I mean, I think that's the perfect
place to chime in. I think that what's,

611
00:39:43,230 --> 00:39:46,260
what is happening very rapidly is the,

612
00:39:46,261 --> 00:39:50,950
is the movement towards securing
ownership of resources. What it,

613
00:39:50,970 --> 00:39:52,440
who's going to own the resources.

614
00:39:52,740 --> 00:39:57,190
And the only existing international
architecture was the um,

615
00:39:57,330 --> 00:40:02,070
Moon Treaty, 67 space,
outer space, 1967 treaty.

616
00:40:02,430 --> 00:40:05,250
And the goal was to not
have a militarized space.

617
00:40:05,251 --> 00:40:07,470
That was the goal of that treaty.
It was a peace treaty.

618
00:40:07,800 --> 00:40:09,840
Now it's being written our attempts,

619
00:40:09,841 --> 00:40:13,080
there's already national legislation
that's happened in the United States and

620
00:40:13,081 --> 00:40:18,081
other attempts that are being written to
define ownership of what you would mind

621
00:40:18,481 --> 00:40:20,910
in space. Who owns it, who
gets to profit from it.

622
00:40:21,120 --> 00:40:25,260
And that's all being driven right
now by private companies period. Um,

623
00:40:25,290 --> 00:40:27,330
and that is a similar model,

624
00:40:27,331 --> 00:40:31,500
which is will the private companies gain
ownership of asteroids and the rights

625
00:40:31,501 --> 00:40:35,730
to mine asteroids and other planets and
what they get there and how they do it.

626
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:41,000
And we'll a regulatory regime only catch
up afterwards after it's happening.

627
00:40:41,370 --> 00:40:42,390
And if that happens,

628
00:40:42,391 --> 00:40:47,391
are the unintended consequences of mining
asteroids being thought through by the

629
00:40:48,181 --> 00:40:52,200
people who are intending to do the mining
or will that be an afterthought? Um,

630
00:40:52,201 --> 00:40:56,510
and so a cirrus rex, one
of its goals, this is the,

631
00:40:56,710 --> 00:40:57,750
the mission,
um,

632
00:40:57,840 --> 00:41:02,580
that Leonard just mentioned that
just yesterday successfully, um,

633
00:41:02,740 --> 00:41:04,420
got the better it
doesn't, doesn't it? Yeah.

634
00:41:04,540 --> 00:41:07,270
Got they're covering up.
I'm one of its goals is,

635
00:41:07,300 --> 00:41:11,920
is to determine the viability of asteroid
mining. That's one of the intentions.

636
00:41:12,160 --> 00:41:16,750
And so, you know, for someone like me
who has spent her career looking at,

637
00:41:16,780 --> 00:41:20,290
you know, the sort of
follow, um, follow the,

638
00:41:20,320 --> 00:41:24,280
the industry goes forward and sort of
regulations attempt to follow afterwards

639
00:41:24,490 --> 00:41:27,380
and what the consequences of those are.
Thinking about it now for me,

640
00:41:27,410 --> 00:41:29,680
this entirely new realm,
which is, you know,

641
00:41:30,220 --> 00:41:35,220
all of space and what the
unintended consequences could
be is truly profound and

642
00:41:36,171 --> 00:41:41,171
trying to encourage the public to
participate in this process as much as

643
00:41:42,350 --> 00:41:47,030
industry is. Um, you know, before the
cat gets much further out of the bag

644
00:41:47,580 --> 00:41:52,470
there, there was uh, some kind of line
and I don't think I came up with it.

645
00:41:52,471 --> 00:41:57,420
I stole it from somebody probably, but
it was uh, it was the, you know, you,

646
00:41:57,421 --> 00:42:01,650
you do the, the peaceful uses of
outer space and then somebody says,

647
00:42:02,830 --> 00:42:05,530
uh, the useful, what,
how is this going now?

648
00:42:05,531 --> 00:42:08,470
I can't remember what I'm
talking about. Okay. Yeah.

649
00:42:08,540 --> 00:42:11,550
Useful pieces of outer space. Yeah. And

650
00:42:13,060 --> 00:42:16,000
that's interesting. I have
a little quick, short story.

651
00:42:16,001 --> 00:42:18,820
I used to go every time
there was a Mars mission,

652
00:42:18,821 --> 00:42:21,580
I go to JPL had a time,

653
00:42:21,820 --> 00:42:25,900
go talk to all the engineers and one
time I went in there and this was on

654
00:42:25,930 --> 00:42:30,250
Pathfinder Guy, the head guy. He goes and

655
00:42:31,980 --> 00:42:36,010
puts me in his office and
shuts the door and he says,

656
00:42:36,310 --> 00:42:40,450
this fails, how will you guys
report on this? And I said, well,

657
00:42:40,451 --> 00:42:44,050
how is this really gonna work?
He said, we're using the airbags.

658
00:42:45,130 --> 00:42:47,830
Airbags. Okay, let's
see how that one goes.

659
00:42:48,150 --> 00:42:52,420
That mission was the first time
I ever heard of co location,

660
00:42:52,450 --> 00:42:56,530
which is what you folks do here.
And that was why it succeeded.

661
00:42:56,531 --> 00:43:01,531
They had people co located in the
same buildings to talk to each other.

662
00:43:02,650 --> 00:43:05,420
People that were working on the parachute,
um,

663
00:43:06,010 --> 00:43:10,570
for a month would all sudden be
going over to another part of the,

664
00:43:10,600 --> 00:43:12,130
the wheels of the rover.
And they,

665
00:43:12,190 --> 00:43:15,990
each person learn more about their,
um,

666
00:43:16,600 --> 00:43:18,760
spacecraft.
But that was called call location.

667
00:43:18,761 --> 00:43:22,900
And then I went back a couple
years ago for curiosity. Landed,

668
00:43:23,440 --> 00:43:26,350
how are you going to land
that? Oh, I'm a sky crane.

669
00:43:26,860 --> 00:43:30,160
It'll be dropped down on
a tether and you're going,

670
00:43:30,940 --> 00:43:33,060
I'm still buying drinks
on that one because I

671
00:43:34,520 --> 00:43:39,270
all right, I can't. And that to me,

672
00:43:39,271 --> 00:43:39,910
you know,
that,

673
00:43:39,910 --> 00:43:40,370
uh,

674
00:43:40,370 --> 00:43:45,370
the partnership that has to develop
between people in these missions to make

675
00:43:46,041 --> 00:43:50,810
things happen is baton passing a space,
age baton passing.

676
00:43:51,260 --> 00:43:56,100
And each person contributes to the whole.
And it's pretty amazing to watch

677
00:43:57,450 --> 00:43:58,283
true

678
00:43:59,690 --> 00:44:04,040
what work needs to be done before
we can actually send humans to Mars.

679
00:44:04,950 --> 00:44:09,220
Hmm. Not much of anything.
Um, it's a problem of money.

680
00:44:10,030 --> 00:44:10,863
Um,

681
00:44:10,900 --> 00:44:14,110
mosque estimates that it's 36 below 35,

682
00:44:14,111 --> 00:44:16,960
$36 billion to land the
first humans on Mars.

683
00:44:17,560 --> 00:44:19,960
He doesn't have $36 billion.
If he did,

684
00:44:19,961 --> 00:44:24,940
I think he'd probably start launching
cargo missions does a year. You need,

685
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:28,240
you need about three cargo missions
to land successfully on Mars.

686
00:44:28,780 --> 00:44:33,780
Bobby and a lot of people from NASA think
the first cargo landing that space x

687
00:44:33,871 --> 00:44:38,700
attempts on Mars will probably fail. And
uh, and they think that they will learn.

688
00:44:39,230 --> 00:44:39,920
Huh?

689
00:44:39,920 --> 00:44:44,220
Not probably a lot of,
a lot of people that I've talked to,

690
00:44:44,250 --> 00:44:49,250
NASA seem to think it will
probably fail in my opinion.

691
00:44:49,380 --> 00:44:50,670
I'm going to jump in.
All right. All right.

692
00:44:51,260 --> 00:44:55,820
So what I've said is that if you need
three, you should send for, right. Just,

693
00:44:56,140 --> 00:45:00,350
you know, before you send
the humans, cause one of them
may, may, yeah, go ahead.

694
00:45:00,950 --> 00:45:03,180
But anyway,
there's a lot

695
00:45:03,250 --> 00:45:05,770
to be learned from those failures.
Extraordinary.

696
00:45:05,771 --> 00:45:10,180
I mean you probably learn if you have
a successful landing and part of it is

697
00:45:10,181 --> 00:45:13,450
luck.
That's not a learning experience.

698
00:45:13,480 --> 00:45:17,230
If you have a failure and you learn a
lot from the failure and then you don't

699
00:45:17,231 --> 00:45:21,670
make the same mistakes again, um,
things work a lot better in the future.

700
00:45:22,270 --> 00:45:25,560
So what I suspect is going
to happen is that, um,

701
00:45:26,170 --> 00:45:30,100
as soon if Tesla,
it becomes as successful as it should be.

702
00:45:30,550 --> 00:45:35,550
If mosque is able to
launch 7,000 communication
satellites and offer you data

703
00:45:36,101 --> 00:45:41,101
and voice for nine 95 a month and
capture their 10 billion wifi connected

704
00:45:41,800 --> 00:45:43,900
devices on the planet more
than there are people.

705
00:45:44,230 --> 00:45:48,250
If he got to fourth of that Earth, a
fifth of that population, 2 billion,

706
00:45:48,490 --> 00:45:50,410
and he gets $10 a month from everybody,

707
00:45:50,411 --> 00:45:53,870
he's going to quickly have the
money to launch people to Mars.

708
00:45:53,871 --> 00:45:58,600
So this is really a money problem and
not a technology problem. If justice,

709
00:45:58,601 --> 00:46:01,540
we threw money at Apollo in the 60s,

710
00:46:01,840 --> 00:46:05,380
4% of the GDP of the United
States went into that program.

711
00:46:05,710 --> 00:46:09,370
Now about one 16th of the GDP of the
United States goes into an asset.

712
00:46:09,610 --> 00:46:13,090
If you were to throw those kinds of
resources into landing people on Mars,

713
00:46:13,300 --> 00:46:15,430
there would definitely be
people on Mars within 10 years.

714
00:46:16,250 --> 00:46:17,370
So Elon Musk,

715
00:46:17,371 --> 00:46:22,370
is he Cindy set that space x will land
people on Mars in the next six years.

716
00:46:22,700 --> 00:46:26,690
What are your thoughts on that
timeline as a sub question? What is,

717
00:46:26,691 --> 00:46:30,120
what do you think is a more realistic
timeline for that to happen? Right.

718
00:46:30,680 --> 00:46:34,010
I think they're the kind of different,
when I originally wrote my book,

719
00:46:34,011 --> 00:46:38,840
I must owe me 20, 24, 2025.
And I said, come on up.

720
00:46:39,140 --> 00:46:43,670
And he said, he said, look, if we
haven't landed people on Mars by 2030,

721
00:46:43,730 --> 00:46:48,260
I will be the disappointed.
And he met deeply disappointed,

722
00:46:48,261 --> 00:46:51,440
that kind of failure that
he doesn't accept. Um,

723
00:46:51,830 --> 00:46:56,830
he recently walked back his statement on
when the first humans would be on Mars.

724
00:46:57,380 --> 00:47:00,890
He recently said, I don't think
many people notice this, but he's,

725
00:47:01,250 --> 00:47:04,970
he was asked in an interview, um,
when the first people land on Mars,

726
00:47:04,971 --> 00:47:09,920
and he said the thing he's been saying
recently, which is 2024 and then he said,

727
00:47:10,520 --> 00:47:15,380
well at least I'm certain we'll
have a cargo missions by 2024.

728
00:47:15,680 --> 00:47:18,110
And that was a real walk
back because he said,

729
00:47:18,111 --> 00:47:22,550
I'm not sure we'll have people on Mars
in 2024 which is what he's been saying.

730
00:47:22,790 --> 00:47:27,140
So, but I'm sure we'll have a cargo
mission. So give it a couple of years.

731
00:47:27,200 --> 00:47:30,100
Maybe the first cargo mission is 26.
Next car

732
00:47:30,100 --> 00:47:34,030
group mission is 2028 then 2030,

733
00:47:34,031 --> 00:47:37,930
you have a cargo mission and maybe it's
simultaneously have you have two rockets

734
00:47:37,931 --> 00:47:40,940
going into it and you'll
have a crew land that would,

735
00:47:40,970 --> 00:47:43,600
that would be the estimate that
I would give you right now.

736
00:47:43,840 --> 00:47:48,730
There's a catch 22 in all of this. Um,
and that's, it is the life on Mars.

737
00:47:48,731 --> 00:47:50,130
Question is it,

738
00:47:50,170 --> 00:47:54,100
there's going to be probably some new
information about methane detection on

739
00:47:54,101 --> 00:47:54,520
Mars.

740
00:47:54,520 --> 00:47:59,520
That's going to be a very interesting
possible connection for biology.

741
00:48:01,270 --> 00:48:04,900
Uh, the other thing is happening and
there's a lot of concern about planetary

742
00:48:04,901 --> 00:48:09,190
protection and the
coordination of, uh, uh,

743
00:48:09,250 --> 00:48:13,480
of international groups and
Alon tossed his TESL out there.

744
00:48:13,960 --> 00:48:18,430
And that was not a happy moment for
the planetary protection people. Um,

745
00:48:19,180 --> 00:48:22,840
although, you know, didn't get near
and Mars or it's on some, you know,

746
00:48:23,170 --> 00:48:27,640
flew past it. But, uh,
there's a problem and, uh,

747
00:48:28,530 --> 00:48:29,321
there's a real,

748
00:48:29,321 --> 00:48:33,880
I think there's going to be a headline
battle between a planetary protection

749
00:48:33,881 --> 00:48:38,750
people and life detection people
and privatization of Mars.

750
00:48:38,750 --> 00:48:43,300
So I'd watch that one that's
going to come and uh, we'll see.

751
00:48:44,190 --> 00:48:48,160
Um, I, I, but I, and the
lawyer's thing is the greatest.

752
00:48:48,161 --> 00:48:51,380
It's a head on collision. It's
just going to be wild. I mean,

753
00:48:51,390 --> 00:48:54,730
it's the wild west sort of thing, but, um,

754
00:48:55,990 --> 00:48:57,640
I think that's going to be another one.
I,

755
00:48:57,641 --> 00:49:02,330
I've just finished writing up and I had
to go talk to a lot of lawyers and a,

756
00:49:02,370 --> 00:49:06,910
they're there, you can have the
Rolodex of, you know, pro con, no,

757
00:49:06,911 --> 00:49:09,730
we shouldn't do this and that.
So we got some real issues coming.

758
00:49:10,320 --> 00:49:10,490
I mean,

759
00:49:10,490 --> 00:49:15,490
I think the other issue that it is being
addressed in two separate questions

760
00:49:16,421 --> 00:49:21,421
instead of one is this issue of where
the outer space treaty was a peace treaty

761
00:49:21,431 --> 00:49:25,600
was the intention of it was a peace
treaty and how significantly more advanced

762
00:49:25,630 --> 00:49:28,930
at this point weaponization of space and
money when you're talking about money,

763
00:49:29,260 --> 00:49:34,030
the u s um,
defense space budget.

764
00:49:34,031 --> 00:49:36,910
So the defense that the space
budget of the defense industry,

765
00:49:36,911 --> 00:49:41,911
not NASA was $45 billion the last time
it was identified and that was in 2015.

766
00:49:43,840 --> 00:49:46,150
So there's a lot of money there.

767
00:49:46,480 --> 00:49:51,480
And then where and how is the overlap
being being discussed of as you move much

768
00:49:54,491 --> 00:49:59,491
more quickly towards Mars and the amount
of money that's needed to do that and

769
00:49:59,891 --> 00:50:02,260
where the money currently resides,

770
00:50:02,261 --> 00:50:04,690
which is in the defense
industry and weaponization,

771
00:50:04,930 --> 00:50:09,930
will there be a marriage that many people
who have for a long time sought piece

772
00:50:12,161 --> 00:50:15,670
in space, uh, you know,
have fought to, to prevent,

773
00:50:16,960 --> 00:50:18,890
that's what we need to
space for us anyway.

774
00:50:19,230 --> 00:50:22,670
That's why we [inaudible] before
you jump on that one second,

775
00:50:23,460 --> 00:50:24,960
I just add that,
um,

776
00:50:26,190 --> 00:50:28,040
you know,
when you tried to

777
00:50:28,040 --> 00:50:31,190
find a timeline for when will
the first humans will be on Mars,

778
00:50:31,490 --> 00:50:36,050
it depends a great deal on what
the strategy is for those humans.

779
00:50:36,500 --> 00:50:41,500
So it actually wouldn't be that hard to
just send a couple of humans to Mars,

780
00:50:42,740 --> 00:50:46,430
have them be there for a few
weeks, you know, Allah Apollo,

781
00:50:46,820 --> 00:50:51,470
and then have them come back. And we could
certainly as a country if we chose to,

782
00:50:51,770 --> 00:50:54,650
we could do that in the
2020s, uh, but yeah,

783
00:50:54,740 --> 00:50:59,000
but we would probably do an Apollo eight
kind of thing and we go into orbit and

784
00:50:59,001 --> 00:51:02,450
come back and not actually land.
Well, we could do both. Yep.

785
00:51:02,980 --> 00:51:06,730
But in the series, but in the
series, what we've chosen to do,

786
00:51:06,731 --> 00:51:11,731
if you notice it's many of the same
astronauts from season one are still there

787
00:51:13,030 --> 00:51:16,420
in season two, Sammy, uh, as an example.

788
00:51:16,810 --> 00:51:21,130
And so if you're thinking about the
first humans going to settle Mars,

789
00:51:21,310 --> 00:51:25,330
which is the way space x and
Elan Musk talk about this, uh,

790
00:51:25,331 --> 00:51:27,070
there are many more cargo ships.

791
00:51:27,071 --> 00:51:30,370
There's much more of a base camp
environment that needs to be built up,

792
00:51:30,490 --> 00:51:33,910
a lot more infrastructure.
And so in my view,

793
00:51:33,911 --> 00:51:35,830
you're talking about the 2030s,

794
00:51:35,831 --> 00:51:40,340
by the time you would send those
humans because of all the, uh,

795
00:51:40,360 --> 00:51:42,730
in placement of infrastructure
that has to go first.

796
00:51:43,340 --> 00:51:45,600
W One, one good thing was, you know,

797
00:51:45,601 --> 00:51:48,630
when I got the word to do this Mars book,

798
00:51:49,110 --> 00:51:54,110
I was at a conference at Johnson Space
Center and they brought in all these,

799
00:51:55,070 --> 00:51:55,320
uh,

800
00:51:55,320 --> 00:51:59,820
scientist and for the first time in one
room people sat around and talked about

801
00:51:59,821 --> 00:52:03,020
where do we, where do you land,
where do we land, and where,

802
00:52:03,021 --> 00:52:06,900
where can this base fee? And then the
exploration zones were being drawn out.

803
00:52:06,901 --> 00:52:10,770
I mean,
it's been real discussion of moving ahead.

804
00:52:10,800 --> 00:52:12,030
There's a question back here,

805
00:52:13,020 --> 00:52:16,260
so I apologize if feel fed
up with this question. Um,

806
00:52:16,290 --> 00:52:20,160
were you influenced at all by Andy?
Where's but the Martian in the series?

807
00:52:20,190 --> 00:52:21,570
And then vice versa.

808
00:52:21,571 --> 00:52:25,980
Do you think he was influenced by your
work and what did you think of the

809
00:52:25,981 --> 00:52:26,814
science?

810
00:52:28,100 --> 00:52:30,360
I have a personal story about that,
which is,

811
00:52:30,361 --> 00:52:35,361
so in my book came out in 2015
in July of 2015 in April of 2015,

812
00:52:38,120 --> 00:52:38,953
um,

813
00:52:39,200 --> 00:52:44,200
I had been asked to do a Ted
talk on bars and I did this talk,

814
00:52:44,421 --> 00:52:48,020
I've done two other ted talks on the
main stage at Ted and they were both

815
00:52:48,021 --> 00:52:51,320
greeted by wild applause and
people standing up and everything.

816
00:52:52,370 --> 00:52:56,180
And this one one was treated but polite
applause. And I walked off the stage.

817
00:52:56,570 --> 00:52:57,830
What the hell happened here?

818
00:52:58,430 --> 00:53:02,900
Jeff Bezos had a dinner that night in
which he basically tried to criticize

819
00:53:02,901 --> 00:53:06,350
every single thing I had said
about people going to Maurice.

820
00:53:06,351 --> 00:53:11,351
And now this was a PR campaign by Elon
Musk to gain more attention for Tesla and

821
00:53:11,991 --> 00:53:15,320
so forth.
And the people that ran ted,

822
00:53:15,360 --> 00:53:18,650
who the guy who runs that is
a close friend of mine, said,

823
00:53:18,710 --> 00:53:20,540
we're not putting your talk up online.

824
00:53:21,470 --> 00:53:25,620
And then in September
the Martian came out.

825
00:53:26,190 --> 00:53:30,900
So my book came out,
wasn't selling the Martian came out.

826
00:53:31,560 --> 00:53:32,393
Um,

827
00:53:32,520 --> 00:53:37,410
I had sat down with Charlie bolden when
I was writing the book and talked about

828
00:53:37,440 --> 00:53:39,930
NASA's plans for humans landing on Mars.

829
00:53:40,290 --> 00:53:42,960
And he took me to one of the 10,000 pages,

830
00:53:42,990 --> 00:53:47,990
obscure pages of NASA that said in big
bold type NASA has no plans for human

831
00:53:49,081 --> 00:53:52,410
mission to Mars. Right there
on the, on the website.

832
00:53:53,220 --> 00:53:56,760
Marchionne comes out. All of a sudden
my book starts selling like crazy.

833
00:53:57,180 --> 00:53:59,370
Ted Decides to put my talk up online.

834
00:54:00,240 --> 00:54:05,220
Charlie bolden appoints a director of man
mission to Mars. Didn't have any staff,

835
00:54:05,550 --> 00:54:06,450
but um,

836
00:54:06,480 --> 00:54:11,480
so that's how much influence a
Hollywood movie had on society.

837
00:54:12,690 --> 00:54:17,430
It right. It actually convinced
people that this was a possibility.

838
00:54:17,730 --> 00:54:19,130
If Matt Damon can do it,
we can

839
00:54:19,290 --> 00:54:20,123
nope.

840
00:54:21,980 --> 00:54:24,790
Dance remix of Steven giving.
Yeah.

841
00:54:27,370 --> 00:54:28,740
And I'll also point out,
yeah.

842
00:54:28,770 --> 00:54:33,450
Did Andy, uh, participated as one of
the big thinkers? Yes. In season one.

843
00:54:34,020 --> 00:54:38,310
So he was part of the first
season of the nat geo a series.

844
00:54:38,780 --> 00:54:42,320
And, and I should mention that he's
gone through kind of a metamorphosis to,

845
00:54:42,590 --> 00:54:47,590
he was very defensive initially about
the facts that were inaccurate in his

846
00:54:49,911 --> 00:54:54,260
book. Like, you know, 300 mile an hour
wind on Mars is not going to drive a,

847
00:54:54,780 --> 00:54:57,690
a piece of an antenna through your
space suit kind of thing. In fact,

848
00:54:57,920 --> 00:55:01,100
you could walk through a 300
mile an hour wind on Mars easily.

849
00:55:01,210 --> 00:55:03,950
It'd be like a three mile an hour wind on,
on earth.

850
00:55:04,340 --> 00:55:06,020
And he was very defensive about that.

851
00:55:06,050 --> 00:55:11,050
And then he got involved
in season one and you know,

852
00:55:11,451 --> 00:55:14,570
some of us were kind of beating up
on him about that kind of stuff.

853
00:55:15,110 --> 00:55:19,770
And then season two came around and we
beat up on him some more and now he's

854
00:55:19,790 --> 00:55:21,980
very open about what was wrong.

855
00:55:22,920 --> 00:55:26,440
He's a great guy. He's a great
guy. Yeah. All right. So, uh,

856
00:55:26,441 --> 00:55:29,880
I'm told that we're at
a time, um, but I do,

857
00:55:29,881 --> 00:55:33,960
I want to thank you all for
joining us here today. Uh, I'd,

858
00:55:34,050 --> 00:55:37,290
I'd highly encourage you
to check out the series.

859
00:55:37,291 --> 00:55:39,420
