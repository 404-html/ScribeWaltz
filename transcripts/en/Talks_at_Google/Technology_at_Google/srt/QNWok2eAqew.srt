1
00:00:08,340 --> 00:00:13,340
We are here today to talk with
Tony and chain of voltaic systems.

2
00:00:14,560 --> 00:00:19,060
Um, and I'm going to give you first a
little bit of background. So first is, um,

3
00:00:19,140 --> 00:00:24,020
at maker faire last year, um, I
had my solar powered bike home,

4
00:00:24,021 --> 00:00:28,230
which, you know, does not power my ride to
work, although that's version three. Um,

5
00:00:28,231 --> 00:00:31,350
when it does is it avoids the
problem that was happening.

6
00:00:31,351 --> 00:00:35,040
Whereas I kept getting almost
hit on coming up to bridge
the Williamsburg Bridge

7
00:00:35,041 --> 00:00:38,940
because I never put the batteries
in my lights because you know,

8
00:00:38,941 --> 00:00:41,710
batteries wear out and then I'm just
too busy and distract the decks.

9
00:00:41,711 --> 00:00:44,410
You replaced them. Some wife
said, come on, genius, you should,

10
00:00:44,411 --> 00:00:46,440
we'll lose somebody about this.
So I found this lovely solar,

11
00:00:46,710 --> 00:00:48,270
I went through with several panels,

12
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:52,980
found this lovely solar panel and put
some yellow tape and a headlight on and

13
00:00:52,981 --> 00:00:57,720
now I didn't have that excuse anymore.
And the mantra achieve, um, efficiencies.

14
00:00:57,721 --> 00:01:00,090
What were my morning commute in,
in the sun,

15
00:01:00,300 --> 00:01:03,120
powered my evening commute home
in the dark and all of as well.

16
00:01:03,510 --> 00:01:07,590
So I was at a maker faire showing this
off and Tony walked up to him just like

17
00:01:07,591 --> 00:01:12,460
very innocently and quite quite
dust slyly as really, hey,

18
00:01:12,470 --> 00:01:14,490
what panel is that? I said, you know,

19
00:01:14,491 --> 00:01:16,890
I went through like I think
four different panels,

20
00:01:17,100 --> 00:01:20,640
did some very crude but effective
testing and this was the best one for

21
00:01:20,641 --> 00:01:24,780
efficiency per square
centimeter of servicing. It's
like, that's great to hear.

22
00:01:24,781 --> 00:01:27,990
Where did you get, I said eight 40
goals. That's really great to hear.

23
00:01:28,260 --> 00:01:32,040
I'm Tony from voltaic systems.
That's my panel. And um,

24
00:01:32,070 --> 00:01:34,490
we went back and forth a little
bit with the actual finished,

25
00:01:34,491 --> 00:01:38,520
he wants to say best one I've found and
I did try like at least four. I remember,

26
00:01:38,820 --> 00:01:42,510
um, he even gave me a free panel
for being such a loyal, loyal fan.

27
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:47,370
And I'm a big fan of this.
If you have never heard this quote,

28
00:01:47,820 --> 00:01:52,530
really Tesla said it best. The Sun
is the spring that drives all right.

29
00:01:52,600 --> 00:01:56,340
Electricity coming down and a wall came
maybe from a hydroelectric plant that

30
00:01:56,341 --> 00:02:00,360
was powered by water falling down,
water got up through evaporation,

31
00:02:00,361 --> 00:02:02,670
evaporation and eclipse of the sun.
And Wind.

32
00:02:02,820 --> 00:02:07,080
The wind is because the sun heats up the
air. It's all from the sun. Of course,

33
00:02:07,081 --> 00:02:09,520
every transformation loses a bit.
So the closer,

34
00:02:09,540 --> 00:02:11,400
the more direct to connection
you can make to better,

35
00:02:11,401 --> 00:02:14,640
which in my opinion would photo the
photovoltaics are all about right.

36
00:02:14,641 --> 00:02:18,510
Take the energy, put it right into
the device, right into electricity,

37
00:02:18,660 --> 00:02:21,180
and do it as close to
the need as possible,

38
00:02:21,450 --> 00:02:24,150
which is pretty much what their
company does. With no further ado,

39
00:02:24,510 --> 00:02:27,810
I'm going to turn it over to Tony
and Shane. Guys, it's all yours.

40
00:02:30,050 --> 00:02:31,980
All right, well, um, I
just a little background,

41
00:02:35,650 --> 00:02:36,483
turn this on.

42
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:41,830
So voltaic I started about
10 years ago and really, uh,

43
00:02:42,310 --> 00:02:46,690
maybe a caveat for census rooms full
of engineers. Uh, I'm not an engineer.

44
00:02:46,691 --> 00:02:49,900
I'm a business guy and I'd been
doing dotcom startups and so on.

45
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:54,860
I'm just interested in environmental
issues and um, started looking at,

46
00:02:54,940 --> 00:02:56,170
at solar technology,

47
00:02:56,180 --> 00:03:01,180
sort of inspired by the flexible solar
panels were coming out and the idea that

48
00:03:01,750 --> 00:03:06,010
those new technologies would open up
new possibilities, new applications.

49
00:03:06,430 --> 00:03:06,761
Uh,

50
00:03:06,761 --> 00:03:11,650
I was slacking off in Spain at the time
and I had little solar charger with me

51
00:03:11,651 --> 00:03:15,140
and I carry it around everywhere
inside my bag. And, um,

52
00:03:15,790 --> 00:03:17,620
with the intention of
charging my cell phone.

53
00:03:17,621 --> 00:03:21,710
But what I found was that my bag was
in the sun all the time and I'd been,

54
00:03:21,711 --> 00:03:24,820
I'd never actually pulled this thing out
and set it up and pointed at the sun.

55
00:03:25,240 --> 00:03:27,280
And so after awhile it became obvious,
okay,

56
00:03:27,281 --> 00:03:32,080
somebody should put a panel on the outside
of a bag and then you don't have that

57
00:03:32,081 --> 00:03:36,190
hassle and it's going to
be generating power all the
time. So, you know, that was,

58
00:03:36,340 --> 00:03:38,610
that's where we came from.
That's a,

59
00:03:38,650 --> 00:03:41,530
this is the latest iteration
of that original idea,

60
00:03:42,070 --> 00:03:47,070
a solar panel on the outside battery
inside generating a charge and then a Usb

61
00:03:47,861 --> 00:03:51,040
port to plug in whatever
you need to charge. Uh,

62
00:03:51,310 --> 00:03:54,730
from there we really expanded,
you know,

63
00:03:54,731 --> 00:03:56,410
it was sort of a design project.

64
00:03:56,411 --> 00:03:59,900
I didn't really see myself as all that
qualified to be doing it, but we're,

65
00:03:59,901 --> 00:04:03,400
nobody did. After a couple of years
I thought, what the hell? And, um,

66
00:04:04,060 --> 00:04:08,680
we got a tremendous amount of press and
a lot of customers and we were there and

67
00:04:08,681 --> 00:04:11,380
in business.
And so the challenge became the design,

68
00:04:11,530 --> 00:04:15,220
a full line of bags and recharge tablets
and laptops and all that sort of thing.

69
00:04:15,720 --> 00:04:19,150
Uh, ultimately the way
it's gone, consortium, Sia,

70
00:04:19,750 --> 00:04:24,430
a product line there. Um, we're doing, uh,

71
00:04:24,460 --> 00:04:27,200
most recently a bunch of solar lights,
uh,

72
00:04:27,250 --> 00:04:31,720
which are specifically for emergency
preparedness and developing countries,

73
00:04:32,050 --> 00:04:36,250
probably most relevant to the
makers, uh, uh, panels like this one.

74
00:04:36,251 --> 00:04:39,610
It turned out that we way over
engineered the panels and,

75
00:04:40,750 --> 00:04:44,470
but when people discovered
that they became useful for
all sorts of applications,

76
00:04:44,890 --> 00:04:49,320
and so now we're selling through eight
are fruit and spark fun. And, uh,

77
00:04:49,480 --> 00:04:52,360
some of those makers are coming back
to us in the end and saying, okay,

78
00:04:52,361 --> 00:04:56,320
now I need a custom panel. And so now
we're in the custom panel business, Tony,

79
00:04:56,321 --> 00:04:58,970
or sit down and design a custom panel to,

80
00:04:58,990 --> 00:05:03,370
to whatever specs the engineers
are looking for. And uh, so that's,

81
00:05:03,460 --> 00:05:05,050
that's kind of Valtech in a nutshell.

82
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:07,873
So

83
00:05:09,240 --> 00:05:13,150
has it been moving more further away
or more towards the end consumer,

84
00:05:13,151 --> 00:05:18,151
but how much of the DIY maker
demand is the business occupied with

85
00:05:20,020 --> 00:05:20,980
the,
uh,

86
00:05:21,780 --> 00:05:25,800
I dunno,
I'd say probably still less than 20%,

87
00:05:25,830 --> 00:05:28,560
but certainly growing quite significantly.

88
00:05:28,561 --> 00:05:32,100
It's probably the fastest growing
segment of our market. Uh,

89
00:05:32,130 --> 00:05:36,810
that and the custom panel business
custom tweaks that people want.

90
00:05:41,190 --> 00:05:43,240
Sure. So, um, the,

91
00:05:43,270 --> 00:05:46,950
the two biggest things that they want
tweaked would be a power specifically for

92
00:05:46,951 --> 00:05:48,390
their project or the size.

93
00:05:48,391 --> 00:05:52,920
Maybe they have a box that
they've designed for their
sensor or their project,

94
00:05:52,921 --> 00:05:55,560
whatever happens to be and they want some,
uh,

95
00:05:55,860 --> 00:05:58,250
panel to beautifully fit
the box instead of looking

96
00:05:58,250 --> 00:06:01,640
like an off the shelf panel was slapped
on top later. But how it's shape,

97
00:06:01,670 --> 00:06:04,610
like if I wanted to do Deca, he'd driven,
could they come to, you could, we can,

98
00:06:04,611 --> 00:06:07,830
we can do all different
types of shapes and forms.

99
00:06:07,850 --> 00:06:12,320
So it's certainly possible. Yeah. People
have asked about circular solar panels,

100
00:06:12,321 --> 00:06:15,620
triangular solar panels,
and that's all possible.

101
00:06:15,650 --> 00:06:17,330
Usually they come back to rectangles.

102
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:23,080
It's more economical and for the power
to square centimeter if you just use a

103
00:06:23,271 --> 00:06:25,920
rectangle. But all different types
of shapes there's or in the hospital,

104
00:06:25,990 --> 00:06:29,690
the flexible panels work
defined work.

105
00:06:29,691 --> 00:06:31,040
The short answer is yes.

106
00:06:32,480 --> 00:06:32,870
Are they,

107
00:06:32,870 --> 00:06:36,290
do they approach like the rigid is any
reason that they're not as efficient as

108
00:06:36,920 --> 00:06:37,753
the fixed panels?

109
00:06:39,100 --> 00:06:43,850
Actually, I lifted this chart
from the web that shows,

110
00:06:44,770 --> 00:06:46,680
it's, it's a crazy chart. My, uh,

111
00:06:46,700 --> 00:06:50,150
former consulting buddies would frown
at me for putting this up, but uh,

112
00:06:50,330 --> 00:06:54,830
this basically shows all of the
different solar technologies from the,

113
00:06:55,070 --> 00:06:59,210
from the mid seventies
to now. And um, you know,

114
00:06:59,211 --> 00:07:04,070
the flexible ones are pretty much those
green lines at the thin film panels.

115
00:07:04,071 --> 00:07:08,750
And so they're actually starting to
approach the efficiency of the silicon

116
00:07:08,751 --> 00:07:10,490
cells,
which are the blue lines.

117
00:07:10,740 --> 00:07:12,380
Oh, it's actually a
different material in them.

118
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,920
Typically. I mean, uh,

119
00:07:16,330 --> 00:07:20,740
amorphous silicon is actually silicon
just in a different format, but the,

120
00:07:21,390 --> 00:07:25,960
uh, Kevin and Telluride and sig cells
are the other sort of leading, um,

121
00:07:27,100 --> 00:07:28,990
thin film panels and those,

122
00:07:29,020 --> 00:07:31,470
those are just using different
chemical structures to,

123
00:07:31,471 --> 00:07:32,920
to produce the same result.

124
00:07:33,310 --> 00:07:38,310
But the thing that really matters is the
cost and silicon has come way down in

125
00:07:38,701 --> 00:07:42,670
cost for interim silicon panels.
And so dominates the market.

126
00:07:42,671 --> 00:07:44,350
It's 90% of the installed base,

127
00:07:44,740 --> 00:07:48,220
a traditional monocrystalline of
polycrystalline silicon cells.

128
00:07:49,300 --> 00:07:53,140
What kind of efficiency gains do you get?
If you can start like,

129
00:07:53,190 --> 00:07:57,610
like I have a very simple crude solar
tracker and it looks to me like double

130
00:07:57,611 --> 00:08:00,310
digit percentages better.
Is that like really,

131
00:08:00,490 --> 00:08:02,440
is that a big gain or
their gains you made?

132
00:08:02,441 --> 00:08:05,500
And like maybe changing the shapes
that a thesis has more facets.

133
00:08:05,980 --> 00:08:08,800
Where do you get the biggest
bang for the buck and you know,

134
00:08:09,190 --> 00:08:10,480
facing the sun so to speak?

135
00:08:12,580 --> 00:08:17,030
Um, so solar track is definitely
making huge difference. Um,

136
00:08:17,570 --> 00:08:18,261
and I'll tell you what,

137
00:08:18,261 --> 00:08:22,790
if you take a panel and face it directly
towards the sun and then even just lay

138
00:08:22,791 --> 00:08:26,780
it flat, you know, 30 degrees
off that direct angle,

139
00:08:26,781 --> 00:08:30,260
you're probably losing 30,
40% of your power.

140
00:08:30,710 --> 00:08:33,590
And so you think about the sun
moving through the sky, you know,

141
00:08:33,591 --> 00:08:37,550
and your panel is facing this way and the
sun's over there and over there during

142
00:08:37,551 --> 00:08:41,540
the day you might be at 30,
you know, early in the day, 30,

143
00:08:41,541 --> 00:08:45,560
40% of the potential power of that panel.
If you can track it all day long,

144
00:08:45,890 --> 00:08:49,070
then absolutely double digit
gains in the output of the panel.

145
00:08:50,500 --> 00:08:54,090
Um, do the, I guess it's
probably varies with the,

146
00:08:54,150 --> 00:08:57,510
with the different chemistry
in the different, in the
different types of panels,

147
00:08:57,511 --> 00:09:01,700
but do panels like how far in the,
in the spectrum to their, does their,

148
00:09:01,710 --> 00:09:06,180
let's Say v Vision Extend, does infrared
work, does ultraviolet contribute?

149
00:09:06,930 --> 00:09:09,120
Is there like a reason to not filter,
for example,

150
00:09:09,121 --> 00:09:10,800
with the pane of glass
for pain of acrylic,

151
00:09:11,830 --> 00:09:14,650
the curve on the graph on the
right answers your question.

152
00:09:14,651 --> 00:09:19,651
That's the spectral response
of how monocrystalline
solar panels respond to a UV

153
00:09:20,651 --> 00:09:24,280
light.
And I each solar cell,

154
00:09:24,310 --> 00:09:28,090
it responds to different
wavelengths of light better. So, uh,

155
00:09:28,210 --> 00:09:32,110
the ones that we use monocrystalline
cells are more geared towards a 1000

156
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:34,870
nanometer, um, the wavelength of light.

157
00:09:35,230 --> 00:09:39,520
But there could be other types of cells
like these multi junction cells which go

158
00:09:39,521 --> 00:09:40,181
on satellites,

159
00:09:40,181 --> 00:09:43,480
which respond to all different wavelengths
of light and that can absorb a lot

160
00:09:43,481 --> 00:09:44,140
more power.

161
00:09:44,140 --> 00:09:47,740
And this is one of the reasons that
the efficiency of solar panels is,

162
00:09:47,800 --> 00:09:52,480
is limited because they can only really
turn certain wavelengths of light into

163
00:09:52,481 --> 00:09:54,190
electricity, but, but not all of it.

164
00:09:55,020 --> 00:09:58,980
Are there any, I mean this probably, I'm
sure that if I thought about this first,

165
00:09:58,981 --> 00:10:02,370
I wouldn't ask this question, but
are there any like compounds, cells,

166
00:10:02,371 --> 00:10:05,670
where would you like just interleave
you know, the different types.

167
00:10:05,671 --> 00:10:06,960
So here in this large services,

168
00:10:06,961 --> 00:10:10,680
we have 40% of each portion
of the spectrum represented.

169
00:10:10,780 --> 00:10:13,000
Yeah, that's a great question.
Uh, it is, the answer is yes,

170
00:10:13,030 --> 00:10:17,050
they're called multi junction cells
and that that's what goes for if you're

171
00:10:17,051 --> 00:10:21,940
incredibly space constrained
and finances are not a question,

172
00:10:22,130 --> 00:10:24,820
uh, so it'd be sort of your,
the government then, uh,

173
00:10:25,110 --> 00:10:28,450
they'll put those on satellites and
Mars rovers and stuff like that.

174
00:10:28,451 --> 00:10:30,460
And that's where they can get,
um,

175
00:10:30,550 --> 00:10:35,190
30 to 40% efficiency on,
on the panel, which had,

176
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:36,760
but there'll be paying,
you know,

177
00:10:36,761 --> 00:10:39,880
a hundred times more than
what the consumers are a,

178
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,580
but if you're a rover on Mars,
so you can afford that.

179
00:10:42,610 --> 00:10:44,900
Whereas the efficiency
of consumer product,

180
00:10:44,901 --> 00:10:48,730
solar panels and rooftop
modules would be 18 to 24%.

181
00:10:49,850 --> 00:10:53,190
Okay. Yeah. And that kind of
thing, like, yeah. When space
is what counts, not money,

182
00:10:53,370 --> 00:10:55,980
I'm shipping it tomorrows.
Exactly. You know, I've got money.

183
00:10:55,981 --> 00:11:00,930
I don't have rocket fuel.
Exactly. Exactly. Um, what are,

184
00:11:00,940 --> 00:11:04,800
what are the popular consumer product
for the, like for the bags and backpacks?

185
00:11:04,801 --> 00:11:06,030
What are people buying them?

186
00:11:09,070 --> 00:11:13,890
The bags have certainly been popular,
probably the sort of mainstream product.

187
00:11:14,450 --> 00:11:19,020
Uh, actually we have one here, this,
uh, this, uh, fold up solar panels.

188
00:11:19,021 --> 00:11:24,021
So that's kind of the most common thing
you would see on Amazon or somewhere

189
00:11:25,561 --> 00:11:28,500
that,
that is basically just a straight panel,

190
00:11:28,890 --> 00:11:33,780
a USB port on it with a regulator,
a skipping the battery entirely.

191
00:11:34,230 --> 00:11:38,400
And so as a consequence, a lot
cheaper, pretty easy to make. Um,

192
00:11:38,610 --> 00:11:41,370
and these are, you know, these
are really everywhere. Uh,

193
00:11:41,371 --> 00:11:44,670
the challenge is that as soon as you're
charging a device straight from the

194
00:11:44,671 --> 00:11:47,880
solar panel,
the regulation of it gets difficult.

195
00:11:47,881 --> 00:11:51,210
And particularly with specific
brands of phones and so on,

196
00:11:51,211 --> 00:11:52,890
they've got all sorts
of protections in the,

197
00:11:52,891 --> 00:11:57,891
in the circuitry that essentially
mean you heard that well.

198
00:11:57,990 --> 00:12:02,110
Yes. Uh, and so, you know,
you put it out in the sun,

199
00:12:02,111 --> 00:12:06,070
but there's a cloud and then all of a
sudden the power drops and the phone won't

200
00:12:06,071 --> 00:12:08,040
let it recover. And so, you know,

201
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:11,800
real advantages with these that they're
lightweight and they're relatively cheap,

202
00:12:12,190 --> 00:12:16,150
but, uh, some, some challenges in
getting them to charge all devices

203
00:12:17,380 --> 00:12:20,230
thing. To me, he says just one
intro battery and plan ahead.

204
00:12:20,700 --> 00:12:23,560
Well, exactly. Yeah. And that's
what we do. And you know,

205
00:12:23,580 --> 00:12:26,220
all of that bags have a battery in.
And you know,

206
00:12:26,221 --> 00:12:30,630
really that's the more convenient approach
anyway. Because if you're, I mean,

207
00:12:30,631 --> 00:12:35,340
if you happen to need a charge when
you're in the sun, Great. But if that,

208
00:12:35,341 --> 00:12:36,870
those two things don't coincide,

209
00:12:36,930 --> 00:12:40,890
then really you need a battery to
bridge that gap. And so a better,

210
00:12:40,950 --> 00:12:43,470
a better approach is to have
a battery in the mix somewhere

211
00:12:43,940 --> 00:12:47,570
to campus typically buy these parts or
is it like people who live in the city

212
00:12:47,571 --> 00:12:52,571
who just want to have one that I use the
cameras need it or want it has a very

213
00:12:54,920 --> 00:12:56,600
distinctive line between them?

214
00:12:56,720 --> 00:12:59,090
Yeah, I think so. I'm
sure there's a, you know,

215
00:12:59,150 --> 00:13:01,150
I mean we see where our
products are shipping and,

216
00:13:01,151 --> 00:13:05,210
and certainly there are plenty going
to New York City and other places. Um,

217
00:13:06,020 --> 00:13:09,170
and probably people could get
away without it and in many cases,

218
00:13:09,171 --> 00:13:12,770
but then some of the applications,
there's really no other option. You know,

219
00:13:12,771 --> 00:13:17,771
we've got photographers a spending weeks
out in jungles or remote places and

220
00:13:18,351 --> 00:13:19,730
they need to run the cameras.

221
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:24,650
There's not really another option or
you're remote environmental sensors that

222
00:13:24,651 --> 00:13:28,190
are going to be sitting there on
their own for a year. You know, they,

223
00:13:28,230 --> 00:13:33,020
they need these panels and uh, a lot
of adventure travelers and pretty cool.

224
00:13:33,021 --> 00:13:33,920
It's like,
you know,

225
00:13:34,340 --> 00:13:38,720
60 year old lady hiking through the desert
with a camel for pretty much the last

226
00:13:38,721 --> 00:13:43,190
20 years. Yeah. I wish I had the
picture, actually. She's fantastic.

227
00:13:43,630 --> 00:13:44,990
Um,
so lots of,

228
00:13:45,170 --> 00:13:48,680
lots of diverse applications and
certainly those worst solar's the only

229
00:13:48,681 --> 00:13:50,030
realistic option.

230
00:13:50,270 --> 00:13:54,110
You can't like a battery and with you
if it's an extended period of time,

231
00:13:54,590 --> 00:13:56,090
wind isn't viable.
And,

232
00:13:56,091 --> 00:13:59,720
and solar is the only thing that you can
trim it down to the size you need and

233
00:13:59,721 --> 00:14:00,770
carry with you.
So

234
00:14:01,080 --> 00:14:04,560
yeah. So something you talked
about earlier with me at lunch,

235
00:14:04,561 --> 00:14:08,310
I want to bring up now where,
what's happening in like,

236
00:14:08,311 --> 00:14:11,190
I think it was Subsaharan Africa,
what's, what are you doing?

237
00:14:11,191 --> 00:14:13,440
They're not personally,
but you know, as a company.

238
00:14:13,590 --> 00:14:18,120
Sure. Um, not, not as much as
I would like. Uh, you know,

239
00:14:18,121 --> 00:14:20,130
it's really,
uh,

240
00:14:20,490 --> 00:14:24,080
there's a tremendous opportunity to
have a huge impact in those places,

241
00:14:24,210 --> 00:14:25,140
the other places without,

242
00:14:25,170 --> 00:14:28,250
with lots of Sun and not a lot
of existing infrastructure.

243
00:14:28,400 --> 00:14:30,500
Exactly, exactly. So, you know,

244
00:14:30,530 --> 00:14:34,460
1.2 be and people apparently without
electricity in the world and most of those

245
00:14:34,461 --> 00:14:36,950
people are in sub Saharan Africa,
uh,

246
00:14:36,980 --> 00:14:40,550
and then another billion with
totally unreliable electricity.

247
00:14:41,090 --> 00:14:42,410
And when you think about it,

248
00:14:43,070 --> 00:14:47,540
the grid in many cases just hasn't made
it to those people and is probably never

249
00:14:47,541 --> 00:14:48,231
going to.

250
00:14:48,231 --> 00:14:52,430
And what we'll have is something like
the same sort leap frog we have with cell

251
00:14:52,431 --> 00:14:57,290
phones bypassing the wired
telephone network is,

252
00:14:57,320 --> 00:15:00,530
is happening now with solar
and you can avoid, you know,

253
00:15:00,531 --> 00:15:03,710
you can give up on ever getting the
grid so long as you can have a viable

254
00:15:03,711 --> 00:15:08,570
alternative where solar energy,
um, and, and it, it is happening.

255
00:15:08,571 --> 00:15:10,400
It's been obvious that that should happen.

256
00:15:10,640 --> 00:15:14,960
The problem is much of the
market has been poisoned by junk.

257
00:15:15,490 --> 00:15:16,460
They're really cheap,

258
00:15:16,461 --> 00:15:20,450
shoddy products that poor people are
spending a big chunk of their income on

259
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:23,190
only to find out at the
end of the day that it's,

260
00:15:23,280 --> 00:15:26,000
it's not working as they expected it to.
It doesn't last as well.

261
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:29,990
So I guess what we're
doing, um, first of all,

262
00:15:29,991 --> 00:15:34,450
we've designed solar lights that are high
quality and good work properly and, uh,

263
00:15:34,460 --> 00:15:37,340
and we're trying to get
those into those markets.

264
00:15:37,341 --> 00:15:40,340
The biggest challenge is getting
our costs down so that it's viable.

265
00:15:40,760 --> 00:15:44,240
And then we work with a lot of
aid organizations, uh, that,

266
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:49,720
that are doing a I the survey
work or post disaster recovery,

267
00:15:49,911 --> 00:15:52,480
that sort of thing in, in
those markets. So there,

268
00:15:52,970 --> 00:15:56,880
there's some of our bigger customers
are at the top of the list there. Uh,

269
00:15:57,140 --> 00:15:58,150
so yeah,
there they're probably right.

270
00:15:58,190 --> 00:15:59,310
The two main things we're doing that

271
00:16:01,580 --> 00:16:05,420
if today I want to say like,
what's the,

272
00:16:05,870 --> 00:16:09,470
what's the most popular use case in
New York City? What are your products?

273
00:16:10,100 --> 00:16:10,933
What do you think it is

274
00:16:13,650 --> 00:16:16,770
in New York City? I don't know. Perhaps
the bike helmet is going to take off.

275
00:16:16,771 --> 00:16:19,450
Not out to them.
There's my Kickstarter.

276
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:26,170
Um, you know, honestly the, the
challenge in New York City is,

277
00:16:26,171 --> 00:16:30,520
is even getting any sunlight.
And you know, so we've done, uh,

278
00:16:30,880 --> 00:16:34,140
a number of installations where it'll be,
for example,

279
00:16:34,141 --> 00:16:36,270
an emergency lighting situation.

280
00:16:36,430 --> 00:16:41,120
I did a micro apartment where we put a
little panels on the ledge and we ran and

281
00:16:41,121 --> 00:16:45,000
threw it or battery and a lighting system.
So that in the event of a blackout,

282
00:16:45,001 --> 00:16:49,740
you've still got a way to charge your
phone and light. Um, but it's, it's not,

283
00:16:50,510 --> 00:16:54,420
it's sort of mainstream application that
was really sort of a, an experiment.

284
00:16:54,421 --> 00:16:58,200
There are a bunch of data
centers around the place. Um,

285
00:16:58,470 --> 00:17:02,340
Tony actually built one,
which, uh, top left,

286
00:17:02,370 --> 00:17:06,360
there was a air quality monitor.
Uh,

287
00:17:06,420 --> 00:17:09,630
and there's similarly, you know,
water level monitors in the,

288
00:17:10,020 --> 00:17:14,740
in the rivers that are
going to detect either a,

289
00:17:14,760 --> 00:17:17,460
the level of the water or the quality
of the water, those sort of things.

290
00:17:17,461 --> 00:17:20,820
And I think probably iot
applications of that nature,

291
00:17:20,821 --> 00:17:23,460
environmental sensors are
going to be one of the,

292
00:17:23,580 --> 00:17:28,080
the sort of main opportunities you
see them on. Not our product, sadly,

293
00:17:28,081 --> 00:17:28,940
but,
uh,

294
00:17:29,790 --> 00:17:33,090
all the city bike stations
have a solar panel on them.

295
00:17:33,930 --> 00:17:34,800
I remember seeing light,

296
00:17:34,840 --> 00:17:38,570
I think like maybe emergency phones on
what are the bridges that writing across

297
00:17:38,571 --> 00:17:39,830
a big solar panel on top.

298
00:17:40,450 --> 00:17:43,760
True. Yeah. And parking meters
as well for that matter. Uh,

299
00:17:43,880 --> 00:17:47,120
certainly anywhere where you
don't want to have to uh,

300
00:17:47,360 --> 00:17:50,280
run AC power,
then solar starts

301
00:17:50,280 --> 00:17:52,290
to make sense.
The challenge is as,

302
00:17:52,291 --> 00:17:55,170
as you see with this example
of the city by panel, it's,

303
00:17:55,530 --> 00:17:57,930
it's beautiful looking panel,
but it's in a canyon.

304
00:17:58,290 --> 00:18:01,350
And so the period of time during
which it'll get direct sun,

305
00:18:01,351 --> 00:18:03,690
which is a 30 degree.

306
00:18:05,940 --> 00:18:09,810
Exactly. It's very limited. And
then, um, you know, to make it worse,

307
00:18:09,811 --> 00:18:14,760
the panel's not oriented towards the Sun.
Uh, and so it will get even less power.

308
00:18:14,810 --> 00:18:18,240
Yeah. Yeah. And then, you know,
probably for reasons of design,

309
00:18:18,241 --> 00:18:22,620
it's actually that poll that it's
inside uses a tinted plastic,

310
00:18:23,150 --> 00:18:27,840
uh, which really mess this
up a little more clearly.

311
00:18:27,841 --> 00:18:31,800
It wasn't a solar engineer designing
that, but you know, it is beautiful.

312
00:18:32,260 --> 00:18:36,110
So actually I'm going to take some of
the products brought and passed them

313
00:18:36,120 --> 00:18:39,960
around. That's a good one to pass around.
That's a, that's our new solar light.

314
00:18:40,670 --> 00:18:41,760
That's a mighty break load.

315
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:45,210
Leds are so efficient nowadays
that the opportunity for,

316
00:18:45,211 --> 00:18:49,170
so lighting's really
opened up. Uh, and so,

317
00:18:49,980 --> 00:18:53,900
you know, in the next few years
we will see that penetration of,

318
00:18:53,930 --> 00:18:57,990
of finally solar lighting into these
places that he currently using kerosene.

319
00:18:58,860 --> 00:19:02,800
So where do you see where he
said the next big, what's it,

320
00:19:02,830 --> 00:19:06,140
what's the big opportunity waiting
for volt, painful for, you know,

321
00:19:06,540 --> 00:19:09,120
portable solar products in general
for you specifically? Like what's,

322
00:19:09,660 --> 00:19:11,880
what's the next thing to
do that has an impact?

323
00:19:12,870 --> 00:19:17,520
The next big opportunity for us ties
into the next big trend in the tech world

324
00:19:17,521 --> 00:19:19,980
of connected devices and smart devices.

325
00:19:20,230 --> 00:19:24,360
And there's estimates that say there's
going to be billions of connected smart

326
00:19:24,361 --> 00:19:28,980
devices in the world within the next
few years and less than 10 years.

327
00:19:28,981 --> 00:19:33,360
And so much of those need to be powered
off the grid, uh, visit a smart microwave.

328
00:19:33,361 --> 00:19:37,440
Of course it can be powered, but if it
was some other connected device for,

329
00:19:37,470 --> 00:19:39,720
for cities are scientists
that's out in the wilderness,

330
00:19:39,750 --> 00:19:43,200
it's going to need some sort of
power in the most reliable sources,

331
00:19:43,201 --> 00:19:45,560
typically solar power.
So I think we,

332
00:19:45,561 --> 00:19:49,500
we've already got a start with that
with some momentum with the custom solar

333
00:19:49,501 --> 00:19:53,850
panels that we're doing for, for sensors
and, and scientists and other projects.

334
00:19:54,240 --> 00:19:59,010
Um, but I'm really excited to see where
that goes and see how we can use those

335
00:19:59,011 --> 00:20:02,830
sensors on a macro scale. That was
such a perfect answer. So I have,

336
00:20:02,840 --> 00:20:06,000
so I'll share with my current project is
I'm going to buy a bunch of panels for

337
00:20:06,430 --> 00:20:10,170
is I'm in charge of my
parents former home.

338
00:20:10,530 --> 00:20:13,710
I've turned off the electricity there,
but I still want a burglar alarm. Sure.

339
00:20:14,170 --> 00:20:17,060
That's all particle up there. So I've got
a particle electron. I'm looking at you.

340
00:20:17,070 --> 00:20:20,510
How well I can tell the parent basically
send me an SMS if you see any emotion

341
00:20:20,700 --> 00:20:25,280
because she couldn't be an emotion here.
Sure. That's exactly what I was thinking.

342
00:20:25,890 --> 00:20:28,050
Yeah. I'll help you find
the perfect panel for that.

343
00:20:28,760 --> 00:20:33,570
Talk to me offline and you know what, I
think, um, it's a good time for Q and a.

344
00:20:35,130 --> 00:20:38,820
Any questions relative to the Allen?

345
00:20:41,890 --> 00:20:43,700
Let me just repeat it. Okay. Repeat. Okay.

346
00:20:44,850 --> 00:20:48,070
Why do you think solar has penetrate data?

347
00:20:48,100 --> 00:20:52,210
Even things like example,
like park rooftops, uh,

348
00:20:52,390 --> 00:20:56,830
like things that, that we use everyday
and then suddenly you're like,

349
00:20:57,220 --> 00:21:01,690
I need to return something and I don't
have anything that I can like take out of

350
00:21:01,691 --> 00:21:02,980
it.
Like a car has a battery,

351
00:21:02,981 --> 00:21:06,850
but you can not take a rechargeable
device out of the car that has been

352
00:21:06,851 --> 00:21:09,610
recharging justify the solar panel.
He's like, it's something that,

353
00:21:10,060 --> 00:21:12,190
that piece out their own
design when the design.

354
00:21:12,980 --> 00:21:17,980
So the question is why having the solar
panels penetrated or made their way into

355
00:21:18,321 --> 00:21:20,900
more ubiquitous places? For
example, the roof of a car,

356
00:21:20,901 --> 00:21:22,730
when a car has a battery
to hold the charge,

357
00:21:22,970 --> 00:21:24,290
why isn't it this whole panel attached?

358
00:21:24,320 --> 00:21:26,630
Why isn't it part of the things
that are out there already? Right.

359
00:21:26,631 --> 00:21:27,860
Why are they separate?

360
00:21:28,170 --> 00:21:29,470
Is that an effect?
It,

361
00:21:31,960 --> 00:21:36,220
I wanted the same thing because it does
seem like a logical place to be putting

362
00:21:36,221 --> 00:21:41,110
solar panels in, particularly
with electric cars coming
online. You'd be thinking,

363
00:21:41,111 --> 00:21:44,800
okay, well that should be just
covered in solar panels. Um,

364
00:21:45,070 --> 00:21:46,240
I think the problem,

365
00:21:46,390 --> 00:21:50,200
particularly running an electric car is
that the power demand versus the amount

366
00:21:50,201 --> 00:21:55,000
of power you're going to generate from
those panels is, is a long way apart. The,

367
00:21:55,001 --> 00:21:55,300
you know,

368
00:21:55,300 --> 00:22:00,070
the area of a car is just nowhere
near big enough to actually run a car.

369
00:22:00,590 --> 00:22:05,460
Um, but you could see that, you know,
you might have a soul, a sunroof,

370
00:22:05,470 --> 00:22:08,680
and I've, I've seen solar sun rooms
and bonnets and that sort of thing,

371
00:22:09,290 --> 00:22:13,690
and they'll be used to sort of trickle
charge the battery and potentially run,

372
00:22:13,920 --> 00:22:16,600
you know, a fan to keep it cool when
it's parked, that sort of thing.

373
00:22:16,840 --> 00:22:19,330
But it's pretty limited applications.
And when you think about it,

374
00:22:19,900 --> 00:22:24,900
the cost of integrating that panel into
the roof of the car is relatively high

375
00:22:25,570 --> 00:22:30,570
and it's then competing with the
alternator in the car as a power source.

376
00:22:30,581 --> 00:22:34,430
And it's a lot easier just to use the
gasoline in the car to run that and

377
00:22:34,450 --> 00:22:36,250
produce energy and recharge
the battery that way.

378
00:22:36,251 --> 00:22:39,640
And so I suspect that's the
calculation that that goes on.

379
00:22:39,880 --> 00:22:41,950
And so really it's when the engine's off,

380
00:22:41,951 --> 00:22:45,460
you've got a chance to competing and
that sort of the smaller scale trickle

381
00:22:45,461 --> 00:22:49,390
charger to keep the battery running and
maybe a small fan or whatever else you

382
00:22:49,391 --> 00:22:51,070
need running when it's turned off

383
00:22:55,840 --> 00:22:58,930
customer and his bag is probably
five years old or something.

384
00:22:59,930 --> 00:23:04,300
One thing I'm wondering about and you
must be getting bored if love advertising

385
00:23:04,301 --> 00:23:07,940
because I must've had like over a
hundred people over the last five year as

386
00:23:09,550 --> 00:23:13,330
I'm wondering how much you got
it has helped your business.

387
00:23:13,331 --> 00:23:16,530
Because when I look at what you do,
maybe this isn't actually,

388
00:23:16,531 --> 00:23:19,000
it's already markets, right?
This is, this is nice.

389
00:23:19,780 --> 00:23:23,550
This is probably not the snare a year ago.
So I'm kind of curious how that works.

390
00:23:24,430 --> 00:23:28,360
So the question is with a lot of all word
of mouth advertising generated by one

391
00:23:28,361 --> 00:23:30,910
of our already in February,
um, you must have,

392
00:23:31,080 --> 00:23:32,890
you must have consumer demand coming in,

393
00:23:32,891 --> 00:23:35,410
but like it seems like maybe
that's not your end goal.

394
00:23:36,710 --> 00:23:40,550
No, I think it is our end goal
when in fact, I think your, uh,

395
00:23:41,180 --> 00:23:45,350
your represented dominant chunk of
our marketing strategy. We, you know,

396
00:23:45,351 --> 00:23:49,850
we're a small company with limited budget.
It's a niche product. And so, you know,

397
00:23:49,851 --> 00:23:52,850
it doesn't work out for us to spend a
lot of money on advertising and that sort

398
00:23:52,851 --> 00:23:55,370
of thing, but you're
affectively, you know,

399
00:23:55,430 --> 00:23:59,280
walking around with a billboard
a that says voltaic and,

400
00:23:59,281 --> 00:24:03,740
and I get the same thing.
People constantly are asking
about it and it's great.

401
00:24:03,940 --> 00:24:05,390
You know,
it's one of the things we achieve,

402
00:24:05,391 --> 00:24:09,110
I think is to initiate a conversation
about solar and, you know,

403
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:11,390
does it work and how do you make it work?
That sort of thing.

404
00:24:11,600 --> 00:24:15,950
And I wouldn't say that it's necessarily
irrelevant in a city environment.

405
00:24:15,951 --> 00:24:20,450
You can still get periods where
you're getting enough sunshine to, uh,

406
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:23,680
to maintain a phone or whatever.
And also there's a battery inside,

407
00:24:23,690 --> 00:24:24,650
so even if you're not,

408
00:24:24,651 --> 00:24:27,650
it's the middle of winter and you're
in New York can still plug it in.

409
00:24:27,651 --> 00:24:31,480
It's really a universal charger. But, um,
I don't know. You may have noticed we,

410
00:24:31,580 --> 00:24:32,810
when we ship the bag out,

411
00:24:32,811 --> 00:24:37,811
there's a bunch of little business cards
in there with our URL on it and yeah,

412
00:24:38,020 --> 00:24:42,230
exactly. They're gone. And, uh, and you
know, often people write into us and say,

413
00:24:42,231 --> 00:24:46,370
can I have some more cards? Because
really sick of writing down the URL,

414
00:24:47,040 --> 00:24:49,670
I want to give them out,
which is fantastic to hear that.

415
00:24:50,940 --> 00:24:54,990
Yeah. I mean, I know every, every,
every traffic stop at least once a ride,

416
00:24:55,200 --> 00:24:58,150
someone asks about the
helmet. Seriously. And yeah,

417
00:24:58,980 --> 00:25:01,410
most people say what's that said like
dish, but it's on them to get it right.

418
00:25:02,060 --> 00:25:06,390
It's a very distinctive and the AC
hum. Let's me in keeping me awake.

419
00:25:08,370 --> 00:25:12,910
What a question. This might be
more of a battery of questions,

420
00:25:12,920 --> 00:25:14,030
but one of my side projects

421
00:25:16,460 --> 00:25:19,370
and all is up off the grid,
small server.

422
00:25:20,790 --> 00:25:24,320
But the problem that I run into is
finding a small battery pack that can be

423
00:25:24,321 --> 00:25:25,154
charged

424
00:25:27,550 --> 00:25:30,360
on the solutions that I buy online
are use [inaudible] acid battery

425
00:25:33,170 --> 00:25:34,003
recommendations.

426
00:25:37,210 --> 00:25:39,120
Uh, so, so recommendations

427
00:25:39,380 --> 00:25:44,300
or the, um, the question is,
um, he's looking for personal
project. I'm basically,

428
00:25:44,301 --> 00:25:47,750
he wants to, he wants to charge and
draw at the same time for battery.

429
00:25:48,470 --> 00:25:49,303
Perfect.

430
00:25:49,540 --> 00:25:52,420
Right. And, and it's surprising,
but that's a common problem.

431
00:25:52,450 --> 00:25:54,860
If you look at typical battery packs,
uh,

432
00:25:55,240 --> 00:25:59,290
they often don't do that or they won't
charge from solar because they have a

433
00:25:59,291 --> 00:26:02,440
really narrow voltage range on the input,
um,

434
00:26:02,590 --> 00:26:04,390
and various other issues
that come with it.

435
00:26:04,391 --> 00:26:09,100
And so that's kind of our job without
battery packs is to figure out how to get

436
00:26:09,101 --> 00:26:13,600
them charging efficiently from solar
and do things like not only charge and

437
00:26:13,601 --> 00:26:14,830
discharge at the same time,

438
00:26:14,831 --> 00:26:19,420
but allow us to bypass the sleep
mode so it can just be on forever.

439
00:26:19,750 --> 00:26:20,490
And you can,
you know,

440
00:26:20,490 --> 00:26:23,410
leave it out in the mountains
running whatever sensor you've got.

441
00:26:23,470 --> 00:26:27,910
And it'll still be there doing the same
thing in a year. And if it runs flat,

442
00:26:27,940 --> 00:26:32,770
it'll bounce back when the sun
comes back and so on. So, um,

443
00:26:33,520 --> 00:26:37,530
it depends on the scale of your project
as to what we could recommend. Uh,

444
00:26:37,570 --> 00:26:41,350
our batteries are designed to do that,
but they're relatively small.

445
00:26:41,351 --> 00:26:44,860
So our biggest batteries,
a 70 what our battery. Um,

446
00:26:44,940 --> 00:26:48,900
after that we are getting into these
sort of now lithium ion batteries that

447
00:26:48,901 --> 00:26:52,800
might be a couple of hundred watt hours.
Uh, we're starting to work on those,

448
00:26:52,801 --> 00:26:55,560
but we don't have a
solution at the moment.

449
00:26:55,561 --> 00:26:59,910
And I'm not sure whether
the other products out there
have actually solved that

450
00:26:59,911 --> 00:27:00,744
problem.

451
00:27:07,020 --> 00:27:09,590
Great. Let's, let's talk afterwards.
We'll show you one. Does the,

452
00:27:09,610 --> 00:27:12,630
like the harvest inserted, the other
one's from at a fruit, but I'm using that.

453
00:27:13,110 --> 00:27:15,380
Is that, can that be used to
solve this problem with this?

454
00:27:18,060 --> 00:27:18,880
I think so.

455
00:27:18,880 --> 00:27:22,170
Like it seems like it's almost daily
one capacitor away it seems like,

456
00:27:22,980 --> 00:27:26,070
but you should look at the
fruit on silver harbor,

457
00:27:26,071 --> 00:27:30,160
so they have the one that's on that helmet
because I feel like it's almost there

458
00:27:30,960 --> 00:27:33,210
if he's got a big capacitor
where you're drawing,

459
00:27:33,211 --> 00:27:34,830
it seems like it could
smooth it out for you.

460
00:27:35,820 --> 00:27:36,960
Yeah, it might. That's a good question.

461
00:27:36,961 --> 00:27:40,050
I have tested the added free one with
compatibility with our panels and

462
00:27:40,051 --> 00:27:42,910
batteries and, and it works
relatively well. Uh, I,

463
00:27:43,040 --> 00:27:44,760
I love all kind of ate fruit stuff,

464
00:27:44,790 --> 00:27:48,590
but there's kind of two big problems
that he's facing and I don't,

465
00:27:48,600 --> 00:27:49,620
I don't know if that solves it.

466
00:27:49,621 --> 00:27:54,621
The first is does it constantly discharge
small power or turn back on when the

467
00:27:54,721 --> 00:27:55,770
device wants power?

468
00:27:56,500 --> 00:27:57,910
Turns it off. That's why. Exactly.

469
00:27:59,100 --> 00:28:02,600
Exactly. Yeah. Most most USB
packs on the market we'll,

470
00:28:02,601 --> 00:28:05,730
we'll turn off after repeat of time
of no load. So it needs to stay on.

471
00:28:05,731 --> 00:28:09,180
And then the second part is if it
runs flat and then is recharged,

472
00:28:09,210 --> 00:28:13,520
does it automatically turn the
USB port back on? Um, and uh,

473
00:28:13,770 --> 00:28:15,990
that's something that we designed
into our batteries in the eight.

474
00:28:15,991 --> 00:28:17,100
Everyone might do that as well.

475
00:28:19,680 --> 00:28:20,513
Other questions?

476
00:28:26,810 --> 00:28:29,910
No, this one doesn't charge
laptops. That one looks bigger.

477
00:28:29,911 --> 00:28:33,530
It that actually managed to charge
laptops. It's the question is does that,

478
00:28:33,560 --> 00:28:34,970
does the larger one charge a laptop?

479
00:28:36,080 --> 00:28:40,620
Yeah. So the one on the top left is
designed to charge your laptop and your,

480
00:28:40,670 --> 00:28:44,960
this is where the efficiency question
really becomes relevant because we've only

481
00:28:44,961 --> 00:28:48,140
got so much space on the outside of a bag.
And as you can see,

482
00:28:48,141 --> 00:28:51,330
we've used everything
available in that design. Uh,

483
00:28:52,010 --> 00:28:56,690
and even then that a 10 watt panel and
really we could quite comfortably use 20

484
00:28:56,691 --> 00:28:59,000
watts and charge at twice
the rate for a laptop.

485
00:28:59,030 --> 00:29:03,530
But getting a laptop charger on a backpack
is, is a relatively difficult thing.

486
00:29:03,531 --> 00:29:07,340
And so, um, yeah, that's,
that's been a challenge for us.

487
00:29:07,341 --> 00:29:11,810
We've also got a like a briefcase thing
that's effective and then the foldout

488
00:29:11,811 --> 00:29:14,780
panels can be quite good, but you've
got to stop and lay them out and so on

489
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:20,540
batteries bigger and you
need a higher output.

490
00:29:20,541 --> 00:29:23,600
Voltage is obviously for
laptops as well as USB.

491
00:29:23,601 --> 00:29:28,601
And then all of the same challenges with
restarting from flat and always on that

492
00:29:29,391 --> 00:29:30,224
sort of thing.

493
00:29:30,610 --> 00:29:30,850
Also,

494
00:29:30,850 --> 00:29:34,060
the amount of power you need for a
Chromebook for a sense of backfoot pro are

495
00:29:34,061 --> 00:29:36,580
very, very different. The find the laptop

496
00:29:36,780 --> 00:29:40,650
very, very different. And so it's,
you know, I wouldn't recommend it for,

497
00:29:41,190 --> 00:29:45,760
did I do that? I wouldn't recommend
it for a 15 inch Mac book.

498
00:29:45,761 --> 00:29:49,890
It's just too small to, to produce
that amount of power. But, uh, it's,

499
00:29:49,900 --> 00:29:53,120
it's nice to say tablets and more
efficient laptops out there that,

500
00:29:53,320 --> 00:29:56,080
that we can feasibly charge from solar.

501
00:29:58,720 --> 00:30:01,300
I think what, you know, one
of the interesting things is

502
00:30:02,920 --> 00:30:06,360
when you think about the communities
that are off the grid, the, they,

503
00:30:06,470 --> 00:30:11,470
they rapidly getting cell phones and
cell phones are still the old flip phones

504
00:30:11,501 --> 00:30:12,334
and so on.

505
00:30:12,490 --> 00:30:16,960
But pretty quickly they're becoming
the smart phones and tablets and energy

506
00:30:16,961 --> 00:30:20,350
efficient laptops.
And you can really see a scenario where

507
00:30:21,850 --> 00:30:22,683
the,

508
00:30:22,810 --> 00:30:27,290
the off grid house of the future and in
developing countries is all DC based.

509
00:30:27,790 --> 00:30:32,260
And starting with a solar light, maybe
a phone charge, you slowly expand those,

510
00:30:33,280 --> 00:30:38,140
those systems so that you can then be
running all the stuff that used to run off

511
00:30:38,141 --> 00:30:41,410
a whole bank of lead acid batteries and
multiple panels on the roof and so on.

512
00:30:41,411 --> 00:30:42,280
So,
you know,

513
00:30:42,281 --> 00:30:46,870
I think it's an exciting time for
solar and these devices really fit well

514
00:30:47,120 --> 00:30:51,530
with, uh, with what's happening. What's
the primary chemistry and your batteries,

515
00:30:51,531 --> 00:30:55,190
are they, are they, um, civil
that asset or they lipos

516
00:30:55,780 --> 00:30:59,280
I batteries. Lithium polymer.
Yeah. Yeah. And they, you know,

517
00:30:59,430 --> 00:31:03,780
so more energy dense then and,

518
00:31:03,840 --> 00:31:07,420
and um, much lighter,
obviously the lead acid, uh,

519
00:31:07,630 --> 00:31:10,080
the future I think is
lithium iron phosphate,

520
00:31:10,530 --> 00:31:13,820
which doesn't have the same safety
concerns that you have with lithium ion

521
00:31:13,830 --> 00:31:18,740
lithium polymer. Right, exactly. And you
know, that's certainly something that I,

522
00:31:18,741 --> 00:31:21,280
I worry about it

523
00:31:22,560 --> 00:31:23,300
really well.
Yes.

524
00:31:23,300 --> 00:31:27,110
You want to pack more and more energy
into a smaller employer that's called

525
00:31:27,111 --> 00:31:27,350
innocent.

526
00:31:27,350 --> 00:31:30,920
Close that at some point. Yeah.
Yeah. And especially with the mine,

527
00:31:30,930 --> 00:31:35,640
it's in a little tube that's
a pipe bomb. Um, but you know,

528
00:31:35,790 --> 00:31:40,320
fortunately the, the incidents
is a relatively few, uh,

529
00:31:40,380 --> 00:31:43,440
I would feel much more comfortable if
ultimately we can get to lithium iron

530
00:31:43,441 --> 00:31:48,000
phosphate that doesn't explode.
Apparently we haven't got there yet,

531
00:31:48,030 --> 00:31:51,830
but we're working on it. Yes. No, no,

532
00:31:52,520 --> 00:31:56,530
not about batteries have responded, caught
fire or anything else. Thank you. Tony.

533
00:31:58,550 --> 00:32:03,260
Ellen, how much is in your, or wearables?

534
00:32:03,890 --> 00:32:07,010
So the question is how much is way
to factor in your consumer wearables?

535
00:32:07,011 --> 00:32:08,800
As far as, I guess like what
makes it practical? Like how,

536
00:32:08,801 --> 00:32:13,630
what's the maximum weight we can pack
in more a bigger battery where it,

537
00:32:14,410 --> 00:32:16,100
right. At what point does
it come in? Practicum?

538
00:32:16,320 --> 00:32:18,620
Yeah, that's, that's
definitely the trade off. Um,

539
00:32:19,080 --> 00:32:22,170
we try and strike a balance with each
of the different products so that,

540
00:32:22,470 --> 00:32:22,681
you know,

541
00:32:22,681 --> 00:32:26,550
we've got a relatively small battery
and a small panel design as a cell phone

542
00:32:26,551 --> 00:32:29,730
set up next level's tablets and laptops.

543
00:32:30,380 --> 00:32:35,380
And we also try and can set it up so that
the customers can configure it as they

544
00:32:35,401 --> 00:32:39,400
need to. If they want to upgrade to a
bigger battery that in mind could way Dan,

545
00:32:39,440 --> 00:32:41,960
then we can do that. And
then of course, you know,

546
00:32:42,170 --> 00:32:46,040
products like this one a much,
much lighter.

547
00:32:46,370 --> 00:32:50,300
And so we're really, wait
is the primary concern, uh,

548
00:32:50,330 --> 00:32:52,010
people might compromise a little on,

549
00:32:52,011 --> 00:32:55,940
on functionality and go for something
like this that it's much easier to hike

550
00:32:55,941 --> 00:32:58,850
with and so on.
So it's really up to the customer.

551
00:32:59,060 --> 00:33:03,320
As a former laptop guy in the
park and cafe that I was, um,

552
00:33:03,590 --> 00:33:05,880
one of the things I always
found actually was what the,

553
00:33:06,100 --> 00:33:08,690
considering the weight of the laptop I
used to put up against the weight of the

554
00:33:08,691 --> 00:33:11,900
charger, you know, the world
war and the battery life.

555
00:33:11,901 --> 00:33:14,090
Like if I could get a laptop
the last than seven hours, I,

556
00:33:14,120 --> 00:33:17,660
she just lost a pound because then
have to turn bad luck and likewise and

557
00:33:17,661 --> 00:33:19,610
getting a bag if the bag,
wait another pound,

558
00:33:19,611 --> 00:33:23,390
but I didn't need my wallboard
anymore. You know, that's,

559
00:33:23,570 --> 00:33:24,800
that has to be considered as well.

560
00:33:25,290 --> 00:33:27,660
Yeah, absolutely. And one of
the things we tried to do is,

561
00:33:27,690 --> 00:33:31,440
because we also have ac charges
for the batteries as you know, if,

562
00:33:31,470 --> 00:33:33,480
if you're not going to be
getting access to the grid,

563
00:33:33,990 --> 00:33:37,380
we set up a bunch of little adapters so
you can just take one ac charger with

564
00:33:37,381 --> 00:33:41,430
you and charge both our battery and the
laptop from the, from the same thing.

565
00:33:41,970 --> 00:33:44,730
It's definitely an issue. The amount
of Chunky one I'm carrying around.

566
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:50,833
Yup.

567
00:33:53,850 --> 00:33:55,320
What's new in the pipeline you share?

568
00:33:59,110 --> 00:34:03,770
Well, the future, the future
full of Voltaic uh, yeah,

569
00:34:03,771 --> 00:34:08,690
certainly this, this actually,
um, is, is the new product and a,

570
00:34:08,700 --> 00:34:11,320
and we've got similar ones on the way.
Uh,

571
00:34:11,321 --> 00:34:13,630
they're not in the market and we
haven't shown anyone else yet,

572
00:34:13,680 --> 00:34:18,550
but this is a laptop. This is actually
more like seven each tablet, cell phone,

573
00:34:18,551 --> 00:34:23,350
et Cetera, double that. And you're
getting to 10 watts and charging a laptop.

574
00:34:23,950 --> 00:34:25,580
Uh, so there's that. But you know, the,

575
00:34:25,760 --> 00:34:29,890
the stuff that really excites
me is both the iot applications.

576
00:34:29,891 --> 00:34:32,030
And so that's us doing,
you know,

577
00:34:32,050 --> 00:34:36,790
multiple small scale panels that are
sort of ready to go off the shelf and the

578
00:34:36,791 --> 00:34:38,080
custom panels.
And you know,

579
00:34:38,081 --> 00:34:41,770
it's really interesting for us when
people were coming to us with amazing

580
00:34:41,771 --> 00:34:45,540
projects and asking us to
provide the power solution and a,

581
00:34:45,550 --> 00:34:48,130
and we get to participate in that.
Uh,

582
00:34:48,160 --> 00:34:52,270
and then for me personally in particular,
but for all of us,

583
00:34:52,300 --> 00:34:55,810
the idea of having an impact
in developing countries and,

584
00:34:55,870 --> 00:35:00,870
and providing electricity
where there's none is really,

585
00:35:01,400 --> 00:35:04,360
you know, it's, it makes it all
worthwhile. And, uh, you know,

586
00:35:04,361 --> 00:35:07,180
we'd been doing some truth. We just,
when we launched the solar light,

587
00:35:07,210 --> 00:35:10,840
we did a buy one give one program
and our Kickstarter backers, uh,

588
00:35:10,870 --> 00:35:14,860
enabled us to go down to Nicaragua and
visit a whole bunch of villages that had

589
00:35:14,861 --> 00:35:18,550
no electricity and get up on the roof and
install lights and that sort of thing.

590
00:35:18,551 --> 00:35:22,750
And so for, for us, that's
definitely a big part of the future.

591
00:35:28,930 --> 00:35:31,780
That particular panel is
the same as are others. And,

592
00:35:31,781 --> 00:35:35,030
and so what we're using at the moment is,
uh,

593
00:35:35,920 --> 00:35:39,630
most recently world monocrystalline cells.

594
00:35:40,080 --> 00:35:44,550
And you see, I can probably show
you the, the production process.

595
00:35:44,990 --> 00:35:49,140
You know, we slice up the cells and
the reason you do it is to try and,

596
00:35:49,560 --> 00:35:51,420
because the single saddle is half a volt,

597
00:35:51,450 --> 00:35:54,690
so you slice it up into
multiple pieces like this.

598
00:35:54,691 --> 00:35:59,100
You run them all in series and
a and solder them together.

599
00:35:59,101 --> 00:36:03,700
And so you see here, this is sort of
our production process in summary, um,

600
00:36:04,140 --> 00:36:09,140
what's happened and on the right weight
coding the panels in poly urethane and

601
00:36:09,871 --> 00:36:14,280
it has a great life in the sunlight, 10
years plus. And so that's why our panels,

602
00:36:14,281 --> 00:36:17,640
uh, sort of that shiny, uh, look, if you,

603
00:36:18,510 --> 00:36:20,430
if you look at some of the
newer cells coming out,

604
00:36:20,431 --> 00:36:25,431
there's the sunpower cell and these guys
are getting up to about 24% efficiency.

605
00:36:27,080 --> 00:36:31,050
Uh, and so we're starting
increasingly to use these cells.

606
00:36:31,350 --> 00:36:35,660
They're a little more complicated to work
with. Uh, and we need to laminate them.

607
00:36:35,690 --> 00:36:38,460
We can't go into menopause early. So, um,

608
00:36:38,790 --> 00:36:43,230
next steps for us in paddle development
will be at least to add these, uh,

609
00:36:43,620 --> 00:36:48,620
to the mix and they'll look much more
like this folder where it sort of

610
00:36:49,291 --> 00:36:52,540
disappears. You know, the
sale is almost invisible. Uh,

611
00:36:52,740 --> 00:36:55,920
and this is a different
manufacturing process, laminated,

612
00:36:55,921 --> 00:37:00,780
but much more power per square
inch. And, um, I, you know,

613
00:37:00,781 --> 00:37:04,440
importantly for us,
better looking. So that's,

614
00:37:04,441 --> 00:37:06,510
that's one element of our future

615
00:37:08,150 --> 00:37:10,130
where, where is the demand
right now? Where are you,

616
00:37:10,370 --> 00:37:14,000
where are you shipping your stuff too?
And what in what form?

617
00:37:14,001 --> 00:37:15,680
Like what does your
popular product and target,

618
00:37:16,850 --> 00:37:21,290
it's, it's sort of all over
the place. Um, and, uh,

619
00:37:21,291 --> 00:37:25,760
we keep getting a little bit blindsided
by it because we've got sort of a steady

620
00:37:25,761 --> 00:37:29,750
consumer products business
and we're selling online on
our website and elsewhere

621
00:37:30,300 --> 00:37:32,930
and, and that sort of hums along. Uh,

622
00:37:32,990 --> 00:37:37,970
but then particularly the
aid organizations will come
to us with virtually no

623
00:37:37,971 --> 00:37:38,870
notice and say,
hey,

624
00:37:38,871 --> 00:37:43,871
we want your entire stock of this product
that we've never ordered before and

625
00:37:43,911 --> 00:37:48,120
all of a sudden were wiped out.
So, um, I'll put in a good way,

626
00:37:48,730 --> 00:37:50,560
a good way.
Yeah.

627
00:37:50,990 --> 00:37:55,990
So the aid organizations in particular
buying backpacks or similar products that

628
00:37:56,421 --> 00:37:59,150
sort of strap onto a backpack,
um,

629
00:37:59,720 --> 00:38:03,230
and then the,
the maker community or the,

630
00:38:03,231 --> 00:38:07,970
the sort of industrial iot
applications at the same sort of thing,

631
00:38:07,971 --> 00:38:12,530
they'll come to us and want large
quantities of a particular panel or the

632
00:38:12,560 --> 00:38:13,880
Alaskas with,
you know,

633
00:38:14,300 --> 00:38:16,370
I'll go through the whole process
to try and do it themselves.

634
00:38:16,371 --> 00:38:20,070
And then at the very last minute come back
to us and say, Hey, we need, you know,

635
00:38:20,150 --> 00:38:23,970
5,000 of these in three
weeks, can you do it? And, um,

636
00:38:24,740 --> 00:38:27,050
we started scrambling to
try and try and deliver

637
00:38:27,660 --> 00:38:28,940
what like was that a good problem?

638
00:38:29,300 --> 00:38:32,370
Good problem to have? Yeah. Yeah.
Keeps it keeps tiny working hard.

639
00:38:34,460 --> 00:38:37,530
Work hard.
Next questions.

640
00:38:42,660 --> 00:38:46,980
No, all these ones. Okay. The question
is all these manufactured by him?

641
00:38:47,650 --> 00:38:51,410
It's, it's a good question. And uh,
and that's actually changing too.

642
00:38:51,411 --> 00:38:53,900
So you see in the,
in the middle photo up there,

643
00:38:54,440 --> 00:38:58,820
that's how you know the, the laser
cutting on the left is automated,

644
00:38:59,960 --> 00:39:02,990
the soldering of the cells is by hand.

645
00:39:03,380 --> 00:39:07,010
And so it's this crazy
labor intensive process, ah,

646
00:39:07,011 --> 00:39:09,470
and prone to all sorts of problems.

647
00:39:09,890 --> 00:39:14,720
And then the coding of the panel
with polyurethane can be automated.

648
00:39:14,721 --> 00:39:19,610
So there are robots that will sort of
dispense the right amount, but uh, it,

649
00:39:19,670 --> 00:39:23,780
it forces this sort of
industry to be done in,

650
00:39:23,781 --> 00:39:25,610
in places with lower labor costs.

651
00:39:25,970 --> 00:39:30,970
And so you don't actually
see any manufacturer on a
small scale solar panels in

652
00:39:31,251 --> 00:39:34,790
the U S and we've looked at doing
it ourselves. And really it just,

653
00:39:35,060 --> 00:39:36,590
it just does not off at the moment.

654
00:39:36,920 --> 00:39:40,130
But with these some power cells,

655
00:39:40,160 --> 00:39:44,210
it's going to open up a really interesting
opportunity because instead of having

656
00:39:44,211 --> 00:39:47,930
a positive and negative contact
on the back and the front,

657
00:39:48,200 --> 00:39:51,710
as with the traditional sell,
all the contacts are on the back.

658
00:39:52,190 --> 00:39:55,130
And what that means is
you can slice the cell up,

659
00:39:56,030 --> 00:40:01,030
mounted on it and use an SMT
process to mount it on a PCB.

660
00:40:01,850 --> 00:40:05,040
And Ron it through the oven,
all the electrical connections are made.

661
00:40:05,041 --> 00:40:09,590
And so basically the whole thing can
be automated and you can get to a point

662
00:40:09,591 --> 00:40:14,030
where the production costs for a
small scale panel at much, much lower.

663
00:40:14,510 --> 00:40:18,770
And so we're working with different
factories that have that capability. Um,

664
00:40:19,670 --> 00:40:24,350
ultimately I could see that being done
in the u s because it eliminates so much

665
00:40:24,351 --> 00:40:28,950
of the labor cost. Um, but you
know, interestingly, it's, uh, I,

666
00:40:29,140 --> 00:40:33,350
I guess the big challenge at the moment
is these plastic laminates don't have

667
00:40:33,351 --> 00:40:37,730
the same life and the sun,
they're probably around
three to five years at best.

668
00:40:38,060 --> 00:40:41,780
And so what we're doing is looking for
higher quality laminates that allow us to

669
00:40:41,781 --> 00:40:46,640
produce that sort of a panel.
But with a 10 year life and a,

670
00:40:46,641 --> 00:40:48,140
and we're very close to
being able to do that.

671
00:40:49,050 --> 00:40:49,621
That's interesting.

672
00:40:49,621 --> 00:40:52,380
Before I heard you mentioned 10 year and
that stuck in my head and I wanted to

673
00:40:52,381 --> 00:40:55,210
bring this up so I bought some,
a lot of people have them. Sure.

674
00:40:55,240 --> 00:40:56,980
Some really cheapo,
you know,

675
00:40:57,010 --> 00:41:01,130
sharper image level solar lights and
a year later they were yellow. Yeah.

676
00:41:01,170 --> 00:41:04,560
And I felt like, oh my God, like the cell
is still in there. It's just blinded.

677
00:41:04,680 --> 00:41:05,513
Right.

678
00:41:05,620 --> 00:41:08,280
Glad to hear you say that you're allowing
me to count because that's what a

679
00:41:08,281 --> 00:41:09,420
thing to put it to fail on.

680
00:41:09,680 --> 00:41:13,070
Well, it's crazy, right? I, you know,
when I first started looking at this,

681
00:41:13,071 --> 00:41:18,071
I looked at every supplier I could find
and basically they are making chunk and,

682
00:41:18,950 --> 00:41:22,130
and it's not that all solar is junk.
If you look at a rooftop module,

683
00:41:22,131 --> 00:41:26,450
you can get a 25 year warranty on
that good quality in the same cells,

684
00:41:26,870 --> 00:41:30,410
but somehow in the small
scale panel market, it's junk.

685
00:41:30,890 --> 00:41:34,940
And I think what's happened is that there
you can go to home depot and buy six

686
00:41:34,941 --> 00:41:37,970
to $36 and I think ours is,

687
00:41:37,971 --> 00:41:42,971
consumers have in part just driven down
the price that we're prepared to pay.

688
00:41:43,050 --> 00:41:47,900
And in parallel or maybe
first the manufacturer's
drove down the quality of what

689
00:41:47,901 --> 00:41:52,760
they were making, if you think
right. And so if you think about who,

690
00:41:52,970 --> 00:41:57,440
what do you use a small scale panel for?
It's 95% garden lights.

691
00:41:57,950 --> 00:42:00,800
And so that's the quality
of what people were making.

692
00:42:00,801 --> 00:42:05,690
And what you're talking about is an
epoxy laminated panel. The crazy,

693
00:42:05,691 --> 00:42:08,360
you know, it's very similar to the
urethane applied in a similar way.

694
00:42:08,361 --> 00:42:09,194
All the rest of it,

695
00:42:09,320 --> 00:42:13,640
the crazy thing is not UV resistant and
so that they're specifically using a

696
00:42:13,641 --> 00:42:17,190
material that doesn't hold up in
the sun to make small scale paddles.

697
00:42:18,290 --> 00:42:22,970
Exactly, exactly. And no one seems
to care of it. Brilliant. Yeah.

698
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:26,960
So we've, you know, we pay five times
as much to use urethane and you know,

699
00:42:27,770 --> 00:42:31,100
we're over engineering because it's
going to last longer than a backpack

700
00:42:31,101 --> 00:42:31,934
possibly could.

701
00:42:32,910 --> 00:42:34,420
Great.
Other questions?

702
00:42:37,750 --> 00:42:41,850
Oh are they recyclable? The, the
components that are not junk to, uh,

703
00:42:41,860 --> 00:42:44,440
to some extent the bags themselves,

704
00:42:44,441 --> 00:42:49,050
the fabric is actually recycled pet.
So soda bottles. And so, you know,

705
00:42:49,060 --> 00:42:51,790
we're definitely conscious of that.
We've used that or where we can,

706
00:42:51,791 --> 00:42:56,791
but there's not a process whereby a PT
fabric can go back into recycling and uh,

707
00:42:58,751 --> 00:42:59,710
and get reused.

708
00:42:59,720 --> 00:43:04,090
It may be that it can get sort of down
cycle depending on where you live and

709
00:43:04,091 --> 00:43:08,680
what their systems are.
And so on lithium polymer batteries,

710
00:43:09,990 --> 00:43:14,740
we send our batteries off
to recycling centers. Uh,

711
00:43:14,741 --> 00:43:18,700
I don't, I don't think it's a
particularly efficient process for those.

712
00:43:19,090 --> 00:43:21,360
The silicon cells,
unfortunately we've, you know,

713
00:43:21,370 --> 00:43:24,730
you're mixing together multiple different
types of material. The substrate,

714
00:43:24,770 --> 00:43:26,320
the coating,
the cell itself.

715
00:43:26,800 --> 00:43:31,420
And actually it's such a thin wafer
silicon that it's not a huge amount of

716
00:43:31,421 --> 00:43:33,260
material there. So, um,

717
00:43:33,340 --> 00:43:38,340
I'm not aware of any sort
of great recycling process
for particularly ourselves.

718
00:43:39,280 --> 00:43:42,280
If you look at a rooftop module,
then you've got glass,

719
00:43:42,910 --> 00:43:45,220
a glass panel and aluminum frame.

720
00:43:45,221 --> 00:43:48,130
Both of those are sort of
well suited to recycling.

721
00:43:51,490 --> 00:43:52,323
Thanks.

722
00:43:55,290 --> 00:43:58,810
Definitely more for style projects.
That's the

723
00:44:02,620 --> 00:44:06,160
solar panel.
I wanted a small weather as

724
00:44:11,460 --> 00:44:12,650
I can find plenty of like,

725
00:44:14,380 --> 00:44:18,610
but it seemed like all the small ones
I have to basically build some sort of

726
00:44:19,220 --> 00:44:20,053
like

727
00:44:21,920 --> 00:44:25,450
are there now like small enclosed
panels that I can just leave outside

728
00:44:26,430 --> 00:44:28,990
for small, you know, whether is' panels.

729
00:44:31,080 --> 00:44:36,020
Yeah. Surprisingly difficult
to find. Right. Sorry,

730
00:44:36,310 --> 00:44:41,160
I was just, uh, but because this is
fully encapsulated with urethane,

731
00:44:41,420 --> 00:44:45,070
um, this is an example of that.
Yes. Here it is. Yeah. Okay.

732
00:44:45,300 --> 00:44:46,860
And then I'd live in Matt.

733
00:44:46,950 --> 00:44:51,240
Most of them seem to be the small glass
panels with a big clunky aluminum frame

734
00:44:51,241 --> 00:44:52,840
and you know,
they,

735
00:44:52,841 --> 00:44:57,570
they made it the same way or rooftop
module is scaled down and so they work and

736
00:44:57,571 --> 00:45:02,070
last as long, uh, but often
just too heavy, fragile,

737
00:45:02,130 --> 00:45:05,470
whatever it might be. So that
could be left to the right. Yeah,

738
00:45:06,770 --> 00:45:07,400
it can,

739
00:45:07,400 --> 00:45:10,940
while you're facing is a very common
problem for outdoor sensors and outdoor

740
00:45:10,941 --> 00:45:12,950
projects.
I talked to an engineer,

741
00:45:13,010 --> 00:45:15,200
like an agricultural sensor
company and he's like, yeah,

742
00:45:15,201 --> 00:45:18,350
we found some great small solar panels
and then they do laminated in the rain

743
00:45:18,351 --> 00:45:22,760
after six months. Uh, so, um,
yeah, it is very difficult to,

744
00:45:22,790 --> 00:45:25,670
to waterproof it,
but since it's fully encapsulated,

745
00:45:25,960 --> 00:45:27,440
it's not only good in the rain.

746
00:45:27,441 --> 00:45:31,800
We've had these bobbing on the Indian
Ocean for months and the full water salt

747
00:45:31,810 --> 00:45:36,320
water, yeah. They, they are
saline resistant. Um, and
there was no de lamination.

748
00:45:36,650 --> 00:45:38,480
Um,
so if yeah,

749
00:45:38,481 --> 00:45:41,330
they're definitely capable and that's why
we say they're kind of over engineered

750
00:45:41,331 --> 00:45:45,290
for the backpacks. Um,
but yeah, rain, snow,

751
00:45:45,320 --> 00:45:48,690
water submersion there.
They're fully tight.

752
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:50,870
Cool.
How can we take one more question

753
00:45:54,900 --> 00:45:59,730
or no more questions? Okay.
Going once, going twice.

754
00:46:01,300 --> 00:46:02,470
Okay.
Would that,

755
00:46:02,990 --> 00:46:06,710
thank you very much guys.
It's good to see this kind of stuff,

756
00:46:06,730 --> 00:46:09,710
the good seed quality that there actually
is advances in this cause this is

757
00:46:10,040 --> 00:46:11,640
what's going to save the planet.
Right?

758
00:46:12,440 --> 00:46:17,240
Yeah. And I think the other thing to say
is that I'm sure you're working on some

759
00:46:17,241 --> 00:46:21,050
really interesting projects and that's
the sort of stuff that gets us excited.

760
00:46:21,440 --> 00:46:26,060
Anytime you want to talk to us, you
know, engineering at Valtech systems, uh,

761
00:46:26,061 --> 00:46:27,350
or come out and visit us.

762
00:46:27,351 --> 00:46:31,720
We're at the navy yard and the
new lab building up in Brooklyn.

763
00:46:31,850 --> 00:46:34,960
I ride by every morning. Right,
right. And you know, really, uh,

764
00:46:35,160 --> 00:46:40,160
it's this sort of stuff that's really
exciting for us to participate in the Iot

765
00:46:40,221 --> 00:46:43,210
and the maker type application.
So let us know.

766
00:46:43,380 --> 00:46:46,190
We'd be happy to help get involved,
do whatever we can.

767
00:46:46,860 --> 00:46:50,490
Great. Actually 20, I'll talk to you about
my iot up solar powered burglar alarm.

768
00:46:50,520 --> 00:46:53,130
Oh yeah, sorry. That's the
project that we're a building,

769
00:46:53,131 --> 00:46:57,750
just moved up to electronic. Okay, great.
Thanks very much guys. And Michelle,

770
00:46:57,751 --> 00:46:58,080
thank you.
