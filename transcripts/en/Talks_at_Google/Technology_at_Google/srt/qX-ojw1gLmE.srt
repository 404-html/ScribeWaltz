1
00:00:06,610 --> 00:00:10,390
Computer scientists don't normally
write books. We write 12 page papers,

2
00:00:10,391 --> 00:00:11,720
we submit to sit calm.

3
00:00:11,721 --> 00:00:15,070
So it was somewhat of a surprise to me
when I realized I was writing a book.

4
00:00:15,850 --> 00:00:19,360
I'd written several chapters over before
I figured out what was going on and I

5
00:00:19,361 --> 00:00:20,740
think it was a friend of
mine. I said, by the way,

6
00:00:20,741 --> 00:00:24,640
have you noticed you're writing a
book? And I sort of said, oh the,

7
00:00:24,641 --> 00:00:29,320
the short term motivation for this book
was a project to that national science

8
00:00:29,321 --> 00:00:33,490
foundation funded,
which several of us encouraged them to do.

9
00:00:33,990 --> 00:00:36,160
I called the future in
an architecture project.

10
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:42,000
The research community sort of gets
sucked into the reality of the short term

11
00:00:42,161 --> 00:00:43,450
Internet and everything
that's wrong with it.

12
00:00:43,451 --> 00:00:46,620
So if you look at a lot of the networking
research, it's fairly short term.

13
00:00:47,470 --> 00:00:50,200
We made an argument that at least some
people in the community ought to be

14
00:00:50,201 --> 00:00:52,360
asking, what should the
Internet of 15 years from now,

15
00:00:52,390 --> 00:00:54,490
what's your the Internet of 20
years from now look like? So,

16
00:00:55,270 --> 00:00:59,890
so they did this project called future
and in architecture and pushed a few

17
00:00:59,891 --> 00:01:04,660
people in the community to go do
some longterm research. And I had an,

18
00:01:05,020 --> 00:01:08,320
I had a grant from NSF to sort of look
across all the projects and integrate

19
00:01:08,321 --> 00:01:12,340
what was being learned. And after I'd
been doing that for several years,

20
00:01:12,341 --> 00:01:14,950
I realized that the result
was probably book sized.

21
00:01:14,980 --> 00:01:19,930
But of course the daddy of writing
alternative architecture papers has been

22
00:01:19,931 --> 00:01:24,490
going on in the research community
since 1990 we've had a whole bunch of

23
00:01:24,491 --> 00:01:26,350
proposals for,
well you could have built it like this,

24
00:01:26,351 --> 00:01:27,550
you could have built it like that.

25
00:01:28,480 --> 00:01:31,870
And when I started to go back and
look at all of those proposals,

26
00:01:32,440 --> 00:01:37,440
you realize you can't compare proposals
unless you understand the problem

27
00:01:37,571 --> 00:01:38,410
they're trying to solve.

28
00:01:38,411 --> 00:01:43,411
So a lot of what this book is about
is requirements and people say,

29
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:46,660
oh, requirements is so boring. I
want to develop this cool technology.

30
00:01:46,661 --> 00:01:48,790
Show me something neat.
But in fact,

31
00:01:48,791 --> 00:01:52,210
when you actually ask what are the
requirements for a successful Internet,

32
00:01:52,780 --> 00:01:55,300
it becomes a very,
very interesting conversation.

33
00:01:55,990 --> 00:01:58,480
So this book is in part
about requirements.

34
00:01:59,140 --> 00:02:02,470
It is in part about alternative ways.
You could have built an Internet,

35
00:02:02,471 --> 00:02:07,390
I think identified 26
alternative proposals that
have been published that I go

36
00:02:07,391 --> 00:02:11,080
through in the book.
Not In painful depth I assure you.

37
00:02:12,010 --> 00:02:13,270
And to a certain extent,

38
00:02:13,271 --> 00:02:17,620
the book is also a personal history
because over the decades since I started

39
00:02:17,621 --> 00:02:21,890
working on the Internet,
which was 1975, um,

40
00:02:22,210 --> 00:02:26,830
my understanding of what problem we were
solving has completely changed. And,

41
00:02:27,370 --> 00:02:31,390
and if I can say just a little
bit about my personal history, I,

42
00:02:31,780 --> 00:02:36,780
in the 1970s we were just trying to
get the protocols to work and it's,

43
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:41,410
it's important to remember how little we
knew or how little we were sure of back

44
00:02:41,411 --> 00:02:45,490
then. There were people that absolutely
believed you could not write a protocol

45
00:02:45,491 --> 00:02:47,200
specification precise enough.

46
00:02:47,710 --> 00:02:50,620
The two people working only from the
SPEC could actually write interoperable

47
00:02:50,621 --> 00:02:52,750
code.
They simply didn't think you could do it.

48
00:02:53,110 --> 00:02:55,750
And of course today the idea of writing
a standard is sort of like, well,

49
00:02:55,751 --> 00:02:58,630
I'll write one today,
but we didn't know how to do it.

50
00:02:59,230 --> 00:03:04,230
And in fact we spent something like two
years with the TCP standard in which we

51
00:03:04,811 --> 00:03:09,760
alternatively to bugged our code and
debunks the SPEC and to bug the code and

52
00:03:09,761 --> 00:03:11,950
debug the SPEC and it's cause he
had to learn how to write us back.

53
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:16,450
Then in the 1980s which is when I,
excuse me,

54
00:03:16,780 --> 00:03:21,460
which is when I chaired the
Internet activities board, uh,

55
00:03:22,840 --> 00:03:27,840
we were getting big and the 1980s was the
computer scientist response to getting

56
00:03:28,871 --> 00:03:32,680
big, which is we only know one way to
scale a system or at least back then.

57
00:03:32,890 --> 00:03:34,840
The reflective thing to do
is to make it a hierarchy.

58
00:03:34,841 --> 00:03:38,380
So we made a routing into a hierarchy.
We had the exterior gateway protocol,

59
00:03:38,381 --> 00:03:41,650
which today is BGP.
We had interior gateway protocol.

60
00:03:42,220 --> 00:03:44,340
We made the domain name
system hierarchical.

61
00:03:44,341 --> 00:03:47,710
It used to be a list that John Pasta
maintain. You can download the file.

62
00:03:48,100 --> 00:03:52,060
That didn't work and we had to
organize the standards committee.

63
00:03:52,061 --> 00:03:53,170
We made that hierarchical too.

64
00:03:53,171 --> 00:03:55,960
We created an ITF and created
areas and working groups.

65
00:03:57,460 --> 00:03:59,890
And then in the 1990s aside from the web,

66
00:04:00,730 --> 00:04:03,310
the thing that happened was
it started to get commercial.

67
00:04:03,311 --> 00:04:07,330
And that was a surprising decade.

68
00:04:08,610 --> 00:04:09,443
Uh,

69
00:04:10,180 --> 00:04:13,180
cause we didn't know what the commercial
internet would look like in the 1980s

70
00:04:13,690 --> 00:04:17,500
and the first part of the 1980s the core
of the Internet was the NSF net run by

71
00:04:17,501 --> 00:04:18,850
the National Science Foundation.

72
00:04:18,851 --> 00:04:23,780
And people were playing around with the
idea that there should be little for

73
00:04:23,880 --> 00:04:25,510
profit experiments around the edge.

74
00:04:25,900 --> 00:04:29,410
But when the NSF declared that we're
going to shut down and from that and we

75
00:04:29,411 --> 00:04:32,680
were going to have a commercial core,
we sort of looked around and said, whoa,

76
00:04:32,681 --> 00:04:37,210
we don't know what this is going
to look like. And in fact, BGP,

77
00:04:37,211 --> 00:04:39,130
the border gateway
protocol is interesting.

78
00:04:39,131 --> 00:04:44,131
It's the first protocol I participated
in designing where the specific goal is

79
00:04:44,471 --> 00:04:46,060
to shape industry structure.

80
00:04:47,110 --> 00:04:51,010
And we didn't understand in the 1970s and
eighties that we were shaping industry

81
00:04:51,011 --> 00:04:54,850
structure. But in the 1990s
this became painfully clear.

82
00:04:55,630 --> 00:05:00,460
But my personal experience
in the 1990s was, was,

83
00:05:00,520 --> 00:05:02,200
well,
I'll tell you a specific story.

84
00:05:02,860 --> 00:05:07,600
In the first part of the 1990s I put a
lot of work into quality of service and

85
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:11,560
we built diff serve an insert
and all this kind of stuff.

86
00:05:12,250 --> 00:05:14,470
And we were trying to get
it deployed in the Internet.

87
00:05:14,500 --> 00:05:18,580
And we went to Cisco and said, put this
stuff in your router. And they said,

88
00:05:19,450 --> 00:05:21,430
we like a customer,
go find me a customer.

89
00:05:22,390 --> 00:05:27,010
So I went to the largest ISP at the time
and I went to the CTO and I said, hey,

90
00:05:27,370 --> 00:05:31,390
there's this cool this sort of stuff and
you ought to put this in your network.

91
00:05:32,110 --> 00:05:36,520
And he said, no, I like clean answers,
but that wasn't the one I want. I said,

92
00:05:36,521 --> 00:05:40,270
why not? And he said, the following,
wonderful sentence, he said,

93
00:05:41,620 --> 00:05:43,150
why should I spend a lot of money?

94
00:05:43,151 --> 00:05:46,810
So Bill Gates can make a lot of money
selling Internet telephony for windows?

95
00:05:47,980 --> 00:05:49,180
And I said,
ah,

96
00:05:50,890 --> 00:05:55,720
the competitive interface, the
specification of the Internet protocol,

97
00:05:55,721 --> 00:05:59,240
which is a cut point in the stack,
is a money insulator.

98
00:06:00,830 --> 00:06:05,660
And you guys know this because you live
above that and you constantly watch ISP

99
00:06:05,661 --> 00:06:09,380
is trying to figure out how to
suck into your value proposition.

100
00:06:10,070 --> 00:06:13,730
They're trying to pull money down
into their layer. And, and I've,

101
00:06:13,731 --> 00:06:17,240
I've talked to some ISP is actually in
Europe, the problem is more substantial.

102
00:06:17,690 --> 00:06:22,170
Uh, you know, I was talking to one
of the ISP is in Europe and uh, and,

103
00:06:22,171 --> 00:06:25,610
and they were trying to figure out how
to suck money out of Google. So that,

104
00:06:25,720 --> 00:06:27,800
and I said, well, why are you trying
to do this? And they said, well,

105
00:06:28,040 --> 00:06:32,720
Google has some. And that was, that
was the depth of their logic. So,

106
00:06:32,810 --> 00:06:35,840
and by the way, then the CTO
said, the following interesting
thing to me, he said,

107
00:06:35,841 --> 00:06:39,860
and by the way, if I did turn on, if I did
put quality of service into my network,

108
00:06:40,190 --> 00:06:42,920
why would I turn it on for anybody but me?

109
00:06:44,790 --> 00:06:48,230
It was 1995 we didn't know to call
it network neutrality back then.

110
00:06:48,260 --> 00:06:50,510
But all of a sudden I
realized there was a problem.

111
00:06:50,511 --> 00:06:53,090
So I realized that the technologists,

112
00:06:53,091 --> 00:06:55,910
we're not in charge of the future of
the Internet. Uh, hired an economist.

113
00:06:56,630 --> 00:06:58,580
I've had a political scientist
that's worked for me.

114
00:06:58,581 --> 00:07:02,090
I've collaborated with lawyers.
I've become painfully multidisciplinary.

115
00:07:02,091 --> 00:07:04,610
This is usually a symptom
that you're over the hill,

116
00:07:04,611 --> 00:07:05,800
but I've been doing it for awhile.

117
00:07:05,870 --> 00:07:10,610
So the book is in large part about
requirements and the requirements are not

118
00:07:10,611 --> 00:07:13,550
just technical. There's a chapter
in there on economic viability.

119
00:07:13,580 --> 00:07:14,600
What does it mean?

120
00:07:14,690 --> 00:07:19,690
How do you think about
designing a protocol or set
of protocol one Kwanna call

121
00:07:20,451 --> 00:07:25,451
in the book of the architecture so that
it is viable as an industry structure?

122
00:07:26,660 --> 00:07:27,493
Uh,

123
00:07:27,650 --> 00:07:31,820
in fact there's some nice
economic theory about this.

124
00:07:32,710 --> 00:07:36,410
There's an economist, one of my favorite
economists is a man named Ronald Coase.

125
00:07:37,340 --> 00:07:38,173
Uh,

126
00:07:38,210 --> 00:07:43,210
and he is famous for having articulate
what's called the theory of the firm and

127
00:07:43,850 --> 00:07:46,220
just said, why do firms exist?
It's really just question.

128
00:07:46,221 --> 00:07:49,910
If you naively believe
your economics 101 class,

129
00:07:50,300 --> 00:07:54,140
which is to say competition disciplines
to the market and you always want to buy

130
00:07:54,270 --> 00:07:59,180
the, the, you want to pick price
and quality for years procurements.

131
00:07:59,720 --> 00:08:02,390
So, so why do you have a big
firm? Why isn't it the firm?

132
00:08:02,391 --> 00:08:05,660
Lots of little from lists that are
constantly competing with each other.

133
00:08:06,530 --> 00:08:10,940
And he made the point that
the process of negotiation,

134
00:08:10,941 --> 00:08:13,400
of finding the price,
finding the quality,

135
00:08:14,040 --> 00:08:16,010
that the negotiation itself was costly.

136
00:08:16,011 --> 00:08:20,090
He called it transaction costs and he
pointed out that of transaction costs are

137
00:08:20,091 --> 00:08:23,850
too high.
Then it's cheaper to build that coal,

138
00:08:23,851 --> 00:08:27,680
that decision into the firm.
And so in some sense planning,

139
00:08:27,710 --> 00:08:30,650
which is what happens
inside a firm competes with
competition to see which one's

140
00:08:30,651 --> 00:08:35,651
more efficient and the interfaces where
you're most likely to see competition

141
00:08:37,340 --> 00:08:39,620
are the ones where the
transaction costs is lowest.

142
00:08:39,621 --> 00:08:43,340
And one of the ways we can make the
transaction costs low is to have a clean

143
00:08:43,341 --> 00:08:45,770
specification on the Internet,
on the interface,

144
00:08:45,771 --> 00:08:49,790
which is to say that protocol
boundaries defined industry boundary.

145
00:08:50,960 --> 00:08:54,560
The reason Internet service providers
look the way they do is the internet

146
00:08:54,561 --> 00:08:58,710
protocol specified the way it was.
And if we had specified a differently,

147
00:08:58,711 --> 00:09:00,210
the industry structure would be different.

148
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:04,920
Not every economist I've
spoken to said, well, Duh,

149
00:09:06,120 --> 00:09:07,500
but,
but I didn't get this.

150
00:09:08,310 --> 00:09:11,190
There was another famous con
conversation I had with an economist,

151
00:09:11,310 --> 00:09:14,430
and I put this into book too. Um, he,

152
00:09:14,490 --> 00:09:19,490
he doesn't like me to tell this story
and name him because he's worried that

153
00:09:19,740 --> 00:09:22,740
somebody might think the conversation
was actually serious, but he's,

154
00:09:22,741 --> 00:09:26,850
he does work for Google.
And, and he said to me,

155
00:09:27,330 --> 00:09:28,860
the Internet's about routing money.

156
00:09:29,790 --> 00:09:33,600
Robert in packets is a side effect
and you screwed up the money routing

157
00:09:33,601 --> 00:09:38,310
protocols. And I said, I didn't design
any money routing protocols. And he said,

158
00:09:38,311 --> 00:09:43,170
that's what I said.
And whenever we look at disfunction,

159
00:09:43,380 --> 00:09:46,560
for example, the failure of quality
of service and the Internet,

160
00:09:46,980 --> 00:09:49,830
it's not because it doesn't work,
technically it works just fine.

161
00:09:50,040 --> 00:09:52,590
It's because it didn't work economically.

162
00:09:53,250 --> 00:09:56,010
And this was this wonderful
quote from the CTL,

163
00:09:56,011 --> 00:10:00,300
why should I spend money to put this stuff
in so that the apps running on top of

164
00:10:00,301 --> 00:10:04,800
it work better, but the apps
aren't paying me. I said, oh, okay.

165
00:10:05,310 --> 00:10:07,800
So there's a tremendous dislocation there.
So,

166
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:11,030
so there's a chapter in the
book on economics there.

167
00:10:11,050 --> 00:10:15,270
A couple other areas that we clearly
screwed up in the Internet of very

168
00:10:15,271 --> 00:10:18,540
technical one which is very geeky,
is network management.

169
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:22,140
And it's really hard to get the
networking community to work on network

170
00:10:22,141 --> 00:10:25,530
management because they want to polish
the data plane. I'm going to optimize,

171
00:10:25,531 --> 00:10:29,400
we are taught to optimize. So I'm going
to get the packets to flow 10% faster.

172
00:10:29,401 --> 00:10:32,280
I'm going to fill that
gigabit link 100% full.

173
00:10:32,940 --> 00:10:37,650
But in the early days of the Internet,
our telephone company friends,

174
00:10:37,651 --> 00:10:40,620
when they weren't busy saying to us, it
won't work. It won't work. It won't work.

175
00:10:40,650 --> 00:10:41,940
Which is what they mostly said,

176
00:10:42,660 --> 00:10:45,570
said if you don't attend a network
management in the very beginning,

177
00:10:45,571 --> 00:10:49,050
you're going to build a system that's
impossible to manage and you should

178
00:10:49,051 --> 00:10:52,410
engineer in every one of your data
plane protocols. That wasn't the word.

179
00:10:52,411 --> 00:10:56,610
They used
management tools and we didn't do that.

180
00:10:56,820 --> 00:11:00,020
So there's a chapter in
the book on management. Um,

181
00:11:00,960 --> 00:11:03,360
if you want your Internet
to be successful,

182
00:11:03,361 --> 00:11:06,360
your protocols have to
last for a long time.

183
00:11:06,361 --> 00:11:09,630
The Internet's been around longer than,
I guess it's not longer than Unix,

184
00:11:09,631 --> 00:11:12,300
but bought longer than most
anything else in the Internet space.

185
00:11:12,960 --> 00:11:14,900
And what,

186
00:11:15,270 --> 00:11:20,270
what is it that you did if you set out
to build a system that would last a long

187
00:11:20,281 --> 00:11:23,910
time? It turns out they're absolutely
conflicting theories in that space.

188
00:11:23,911 --> 00:11:27,990
One theories is requirements change.
And so your architecture has to adapt.

189
00:11:28,500 --> 00:11:31,560
Your system has to change over time
because the requirements will change.

190
00:11:32,130 --> 00:11:35,670
And so flexibility and
adaptability is key to longevity.

191
00:11:35,910 --> 00:11:37,890
But there's a competing competing theory,

192
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:42,920
which is the thing that makes your
network survive is the stability as a

193
00:11:45,361 --> 00:11:49,680
platform layer and IP.
The Internet that I am concerned with,

194
00:11:49,880 --> 00:11:53,680
you know the stuff up there, the guys
[inaudible] you guys are just apps, right?

195
00:11:53,710 --> 00:11:57,040
You're not the internet, your apps
not to the user. You're the Internet.

196
00:11:57,490 --> 00:12:00,550
Facebook's the Internet. Twitter
see Internet. But you know,

197
00:12:00,580 --> 00:12:03,070
as a network engineer I just moved bites.
Okay.

198
00:12:03,400 --> 00:12:06,130
But the stability of the platform,

199
00:12:07,090 --> 00:12:10,300
the fact that the Ip layer is
not going to change rapidly,

200
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:14,680
it makes it an inviting place for
innovators to come and sit on top.

201
00:12:14,681 --> 00:12:16,810
And as soon as you have
innovators sitting on top of you,

202
00:12:17,650 --> 00:12:21,850
then they will demand that your platform
survive so that they can survive.

203
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,910
And so you're going to virtuous circle
there in which the platform doesn't

204
00:12:24,911 --> 00:12:25,744
change.

205
00:12:26,620 --> 00:12:30,430
But how do you deal with changing
requirements in that space? Well,

206
00:12:30,730 --> 00:12:34,750
people have argued that that periodically
you just have to throw it out and

207
00:12:34,751 --> 00:12:35,530
start over,

208
00:12:35,530 --> 00:12:39,400
which is one of the reasons
why we encouraged the
national science foundation to

209
00:12:39,401 --> 00:12:43,030
think about a future Internet architecture
project because maybe that time will

210
00:12:43,031 --> 00:12:46,300
come. I had a friend who
was in a different business,

211
00:12:46,301 --> 00:12:51,301
he was in the automobile industry and
he talked to me about the history of

212
00:12:52,181 --> 00:12:56,470
collaboration. I don't know
whether anybody here has
ever worked on a carburetor.

213
00:12:58,030 --> 00:13:02,110
Yeah, okay. It's the Spaghetti
Code of the automobile industry.

214
00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:03,670
If you ever took a carburetor,

215
00:13:03,730 --> 00:13:08,080
a little vacuum tubes and vacuum tubes
on vacuum tubes, but they're so mature,

216
00:13:08,081 --> 00:13:11,500
they were so good that
nobody could displace them.

217
00:13:11,501 --> 00:13:13,250
And they were just
fantastic fuel injection.

218
00:13:13,300 --> 00:13:17,980
Guys were stalking them from the other
side of the street saying this would work

219
00:13:17,981 --> 00:13:19,840
better,
but it wasn't mature.

220
00:13:20,440 --> 00:13:25,330
But what killed carboration was a
sudden dramatic change and requirements

221
00:13:25,690 --> 00:13:30,070
simultaneously. The need to be very fuel
efficient. I remember the fuel embargo.

222
00:13:31,870 --> 00:13:35,380
How many of you were born in the
few of environment? My God. Um,

223
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:38,410
and the need that's back there. I asked
her I to remember the fuel embargo, right?

224
00:13:38,980 --> 00:13:43,980
And the need to be a very fuel
efficient and cost effective and good

225
00:13:44,171 --> 00:13:45,004
performance.

226
00:13:45,220 --> 00:13:48,460
And when they had to deal with an
emission control and when they had to deal

227
00:13:48,461 --> 00:13:51,550
with all of that once the carboration
guys that couldn't quite do it,

228
00:13:52,060 --> 00:13:53,470
the fuel injection guys took them.

229
00:13:53,990 --> 00:13:57,520
And the only place you can find a
carburetor today is on my lawn mower,

230
00:13:57,700 --> 00:13:59,530
which it could not, it's not
true. My now is electric,

231
00:14:00,610 --> 00:14:05,470
but carburetors held off fuel
injection for like 20, 30 years.

232
00:14:05,980 --> 00:14:09,010
So it's pretty frustrating to live on
the other side of the street stock in the

233
00:14:09,011 --> 00:14:11,680
success story saying, well maybe
they'll stumble and I can take them.

234
00:14:12,460 --> 00:14:15,030
But that was the whole idea behind the,

235
00:14:15,370 --> 00:14:18,430
the sort of episodic replacement theory.

236
00:14:18,431 --> 00:14:20,410
So this is our chapter
in my book on longevity.

237
00:14:20,411 --> 00:14:25,411
I outline 27 competing theories
about how a system can be designed,

238
00:14:26,951 --> 00:14:30,940
so it'll live a long time.
So there's a chapter on economics,

239
00:14:30,941 --> 00:14:35,290
there's a chapter on longevity
as a chapter on management.

240
00:14:36,280 --> 00:14:37,690
Uh,
and as I said,

241
00:14:37,720 --> 00:14:41,860
there's also a chapter
on my personal history,

242
00:14:42,650 --> 00:14:44,650
my,
my journey of discovery.

243
00:14:45,340 --> 00:14:50,230
These various transformative conversations
I've had with economists, uh,

244
00:14:50,680 --> 00:14:53,450
which caused me to hire an economist.
Uh,

245
00:14:53,451 --> 00:14:56,090
there's also a long discussion
in the book on security.

246
00:14:56,870 --> 00:14:59,660
You can't talk about the internet
today without talking about security.

247
00:14:59,720 --> 00:15:02,960
And I confess I've gotten somewhat grumpy

248
00:15:04,940 --> 00:15:07,280
when I go to Washington and,
and people say,

249
00:15:07,281 --> 00:15:10,250
why didn't you think about security from
the very beginning? You got that done.

250
00:15:11,270 --> 00:15:14,930
And the answer is what we did think about
security from the very beginning when

251
00:15:14,931 --> 00:15:19,370
maybe didn't think about it and right.
We should try to think about it.

252
00:15:20,510 --> 00:15:24,200
But the thing you got to
remember is when somebody says,

253
00:15:24,230 --> 00:15:27,710
I want the Internet to be more secure,
or they say,

254
00:15:28,520 --> 00:15:32,060
the current meme is the Internet's broken.
What does that mean?

255
00:15:32,090 --> 00:15:35,330
What does it mean to say the
Internet's broken? I just don't know.

256
00:15:36,380 --> 00:15:40,430
But you have to take that aspirational
word. I want more security.

257
00:15:40,431 --> 00:15:42,920
It's a motherhood where you know,
cheap,

258
00:15:43,160 --> 00:15:46,670
secure and you have to break it
down into actionable elements.

259
00:15:46,671 --> 00:15:49,100
So if you want to talk about security
holistically, you have to sort of say,

260
00:15:49,101 --> 00:15:52,130
well what's a way of breaking it
up into actionable components?

261
00:15:53,150 --> 00:15:54,200
And when you do that,

262
00:15:54,230 --> 00:15:59,230
you realize that different parts of the
ecosystem are responsible for different

263
00:16:00,141 --> 00:16:01,010
parts of the problem.

264
00:16:02,060 --> 00:16:05,270
And I thought I would give you just a
couple of examples in that space because

265
00:16:05,271 --> 00:16:07,160
security is such a hot topic right now.

266
00:16:08,060 --> 00:16:11,690
Remember to me the
Internet is not Facebook.

267
00:16:12,500 --> 00:16:15,080
The Internet is not Google.
The Internet is not Twitter.

268
00:16:15,290 --> 00:16:19,850
The Internet is a general platform that
carries packets and apps can be built on

269
00:16:19,851 --> 00:16:22,730
top of it and you can build any
kind of app you want. You know,

270
00:16:22,740 --> 00:16:25,820
when Tim Burners Lee came along and
defended the web, we all said, oh,

271
00:16:25,850 --> 00:16:30,470
what a fantastic thing. It just
naturally ran on top of our platform.

272
00:16:31,280 --> 00:16:33,230
And then when nobody was
looking, we rent, rent, fixed,

273
00:16:33,231 --> 00:16:36,140
all sorts of things that would work
better. But you know, the illusion was,

274
00:16:36,620 --> 00:16:38,630
you know, it just, it's just
an APP. It just happened.

275
00:16:39,350 --> 00:16:44,030
And when video streaming starts,
we knew we were going to do video.

276
00:16:44,270 --> 00:16:48,080
We were streaming video in the
unit in the 1980s it's just,

277
00:16:48,081 --> 00:16:51,230
it wasn't commercially viable. We knew we
could stream video, we knew we could do,

278
00:16:51,410 --> 00:16:55,280
we just had to wait for enough people to
have broadband and for the cost to come

279
00:16:55,281 --> 00:16:59,180
down, it's a cost issue. You
know there were some curves,

280
00:16:59,181 --> 00:17:00,500
we were watching the curves,

281
00:17:00,950 --> 00:17:05,950
which is how much does it cost Netflix
to mail out a DVD and mail it back and

282
00:17:07,880 --> 00:17:11,750
what is the cost going to be to
stream the stuff over the internet.

283
00:17:11,751 --> 00:17:14,930
And you could see those curves coming
in to come together. Now there was also,

284
00:17:15,110 --> 00:17:17,830
Netflix also had our rent,
this licensing problem. They,

285
00:17:17,831 --> 00:17:20,170
they didn't have the licensing
rights to send the stuff online.

286
00:17:20,180 --> 00:17:21,410
So there's another issue there.
But

287
00:17:23,030 --> 00:17:27,650
we've re engineered a lot of the Internet
again to, to make video streaming work.

288
00:17:27,651 --> 00:17:30,080
And you guys know that you've
put a lot of effort into youtube.

289
00:17:30,110 --> 00:17:32,640
You know how much effort
you've put into it. Um,

290
00:17:33,170 --> 00:17:37,700
Netflix and youtube together are 50% of
all the traffic flowing into most ISP

291
00:17:37,700 --> 00:17:38,533
today.
Okay.

292
00:17:38,780 --> 00:17:43,780
American ESPs and other countries are
suffering the same fatus network as

293
00:17:44,360 --> 00:17:48,920
Netflix shows up,
but you have to go back to security.

294
00:17:49,740 --> 00:17:51,810
When you begin to break
the problem into parts,

295
00:17:51,811 --> 00:17:56,811
you realize that security
is not a dimension along
which you're optimizing and

296
00:17:57,451 --> 00:17:59,040
there's perfection out there.
It doesn't work.

297
00:17:59,630 --> 00:18:04,630
Security is a multidimensional space
in which different objectives actually

298
00:18:04,680 --> 00:18:09,680
compete with each other and different
stakeholders compete with each other and

299
00:18:10,740 --> 00:18:14,760
to build a successfully secure Internet
is to say you have built a compromise in

300
00:18:14,761 --> 00:18:19,410
which all of the actors will, will allow
your solution to survive if you build a,

301
00:18:20,170 --> 00:18:23,820
if you perfect privacy scheme,
this guy from the NSA shows up and says,

302
00:18:23,821 --> 00:18:27,060
can I have a little word with you?
And he does security too.

303
00:18:27,061 --> 00:18:29,190
He calls it national security,
but it's security.

304
00:18:30,540 --> 00:18:35,370
If you build a network
that's completely encrypted,

305
00:18:35,371 --> 00:18:38,670
of course all the people that wanted to
look at what you were doing so that they

306
00:18:38,671 --> 00:18:42,660
could gather demographic
information about you get cranky.

307
00:18:43,290 --> 00:18:45,090
So there are all these
tensions in the system.

308
00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:48,950
But I wanted to say a couple things
about security because it is so important

309
00:18:48,951 --> 00:18:53,580
than um, I broke the problem
in the book into four parts,

310
00:18:53,581 --> 00:18:57,210
which is people who trust each other
or trying to communicate and there's a

311
00:18:57,211 --> 00:19:02,211
third party who is trying to
interfere steel modify block.

312
00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:06,720
Okay? That's the classic
problem of information security.

313
00:19:07,110 --> 00:19:09,330
The second problem is I connect
to you and you attack me.

314
00:19:10,500 --> 00:19:11,333
Okay?

315
00:19:11,930 --> 00:19:16,300
No, I go to a website and it
downloads malware or to, you know,

316
00:19:16,301 --> 00:19:19,600
a download email and it turns out to
be spam or have a malicious attachment.

317
00:19:19,990 --> 00:19:22,060
The third problem is
the mechanisms of the,

318
00:19:22,450 --> 00:19:26,170
the Internet that I'm talking about
are themselves broken and most of the

319
00:19:26,171 --> 00:19:28,000
mechanisms in the
Internet today are broken.

320
00:19:28,570 --> 00:19:31,690
And the fourth one is denial of service
attacks because that's sort of in a

321
00:19:31,691 --> 00:19:35,080
special category. Just so say a few
words about some of these things.

322
00:19:37,180 --> 00:19:40,300
If you look at the,
the basic services of the Internet today,

323
00:19:41,950 --> 00:19:45,730
they all suffer from poor security.
The domain name system is insecure.

324
00:19:46,630 --> 00:19:48,970
The certificate authority
system is insecure.

325
00:19:50,230 --> 00:19:55,150
The routing protocol, BGP is insecurity.
I said, why is this? Why, why,

326
00:19:55,151 --> 00:19:56,850
why, why, why? Um,

327
00:19:57,490 --> 00:20:01,600
the basic vulnerability of the Border
Gateway Protocol is that I can announce

328
00:20:01,601 --> 00:20:04,900
that I'm the best route to someplace.
And if somebody believes me,

329
00:20:04,901 --> 00:20:07,350
some of my traffic comes here.
So I think,

330
00:20:07,500 --> 00:20:11,890
I think a while back there was some Google
traffic that went to Russia and there

331
00:20:11,891 --> 00:20:15,220
was apparently some Nigeria. And who said
it was all my fault. I'm terribly sorry.

332
00:20:15,221 --> 00:20:17,770
Don't blame me. I, this is weird.

333
00:20:18,610 --> 00:20:23,610
We knew this vulnerability existed in
1983 it's documented that we knew the

334
00:20:25,961 --> 00:20:29,920
vulnerability existed in 1983.
So, you know, you could say,

335
00:20:29,950 --> 00:20:31,150
why the rude word,

336
00:20:31,210 --> 00:20:35,230
do we still have the problem if
we knew it existed in 1883 and,

337
00:20:35,260 --> 00:20:37,120
and the answer is not a technical one.

338
00:20:39,520 --> 00:20:42,070
First of all,
there are bitter,

339
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:47,400
unending debates about what component
that insecurity is actually the most

340
00:20:49,541 --> 00:20:53,590
important to fix.
What is the security vulnerability?

341
00:20:53,591 --> 00:20:54,700
And we really got to deal with,

342
00:20:54,970 --> 00:20:57,430
and if you can't get people
to agree on the requirement,

343
00:20:57,460 --> 00:20:59,710
you're never going to get them
to agree on a solution. Okay?

344
00:21:00,580 --> 00:21:05,580
Some people think without the problem is
his attack on the inner inner exchange

345
00:21:07,271 --> 00:21:10,510
of packets at an exchange of
packets across an exchange.

346
00:21:10,870 --> 00:21:12,900
Some people think it's the
injection of false routing,

347
00:21:13,210 --> 00:21:16,120
disagree about what the thing,
and the second problem is,

348
00:21:17,170 --> 00:21:19,720
the people who suffer are not
the people who would have to pay.

349
00:21:19,721 --> 00:21:22,720
It's another example of why should I
pay a lot of money to save him money?

350
00:21:24,130 --> 00:21:29,130
If Comcast puts a whole lot of money
in to making sure that their routing is

351
00:21:29,321 --> 00:21:33,590
perfect,
did they make any more money?

352
00:21:34,220 --> 00:21:38,420
No. Other people have fewer attacks
on it, but those are other people.

353
00:21:38,520 --> 00:21:41,230
Those other people pay Comcast. No, no.

354
00:21:41,240 --> 00:21:43,970
I've talked to Comcast and they do put
a lot of effort into this because they

355
00:21:43,971 --> 00:21:46,580
want to be good citizens,
but the other problem is

356
00:21:49,780 --> 00:21:50,950
they can't do it alone.

357
00:21:51,310 --> 00:21:53,770
They may be the biggest consumer
ISP in the United States,

358
00:21:53,771 --> 00:21:57,010
but they need other people to do things.
So there's a huge coordination problem.

359
00:21:57,520 --> 00:22:01,420
So if you have a problem where people
can't agree on what the problem really is,

360
00:22:02,110 --> 00:22:04,780
there's what the economist
called a negative externality,

361
00:22:05,250 --> 00:22:08,320
which is I have to spend money so he can
save something and there's a terrible

362
00:22:08,321 --> 00:22:12,910
coordination problem and there's nobody
in charge and the whole essence of the

363
00:22:12,911 --> 00:22:15,940
Internet, there's nobody in charge.
Oh we love it. Whoopee. Okay.

364
00:22:15,941 --> 00:22:19,650
There's nobody in charge. It makes it
really hard to fix these problems. Okay,

365
00:22:19,990 --> 00:22:24,280
so the discussion of economics
relates to the discussion of security.

366
00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:29,470
I want to come back to a couple of other
aspects of security because I've been

367
00:22:29,471 --> 00:22:30,490
thinking about it a lot.

368
00:22:31,270 --> 00:22:35,770
I talked about the classic communications
or information security problems,

369
00:22:35,771 --> 00:22:39,940
which is I want to have a
trusted conversation with
you and somebody is trying

370
00:22:39,941 --> 00:22:40,774
to mess it up.

371
00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:43,870
The classic solution is here come
the cryptographers over the hill,

372
00:22:43,871 --> 00:22:45,940
we're going to encrypt everything
and then everything will be great.

373
00:22:49,330 --> 00:22:50,860
Crypto is not pixie dust.

374
00:22:50,861 --> 00:22:54,500
You can't sprinkle it on a problem
and make the problem go away. I,

375
00:22:54,820 --> 00:22:57,580
I was talking to a counter intelligence
friend of mine and he said,

376
00:22:58,540 --> 00:23:02,410
only amateurs think you have to break
the crypto. We just mess with the keys.

377
00:23:03,910 --> 00:23:07,450
And if you look at the horrible problems
we have today with their certificate

378
00:23:07,451 --> 00:23:09,070
authority system,
which in fact Google is,

379
00:23:09,420 --> 00:23:12,130
is I think leading the charge
to try to make it better.

380
00:23:13,050 --> 00:23:16,330
And the reason why we have horrible
problems with the certificate authority

381
00:23:16,331 --> 00:23:19,300
system,
which have to do with lack of trust,

382
00:23:19,330 --> 00:23:21,970
a lack of understanding of
which actors were trustworthy,

383
00:23:22,230 --> 00:23:26,500
an inability to coordinate a global
system in which people are definitionally

384
00:23:26,501 --> 00:23:27,334
untrustworthy,

385
00:23:28,080 --> 00:23:28,913
uh,

386
00:23:30,780 --> 00:23:32,820
cryptographers tend to say,
well, we'll solve them.

387
00:23:33,060 --> 00:23:36,570
You over there you go solve the key
problem. No, that's where the problem is.

388
00:23:36,571 --> 00:23:38,910
Everybody go over there and solve
the key key management problem.

389
00:23:39,390 --> 00:23:44,250
That is the key issue. Oh God, I said
it. That's the key issue. I'm sorry.

390
00:23:44,340 --> 00:23:45,173
Forgive me.

391
00:23:47,360 --> 00:23:50,780
But there's one other thing I want
to say about information security.

392
00:23:51,830 --> 00:23:55,370
If we teach this in school, we say there
are three elements with sometimes six,

393
00:23:55,371 --> 00:24:00,200
but the most important ones
are confidentiality, integrity,

394
00:24:00,980 --> 00:24:01,850
and availability.

395
00:24:03,380 --> 00:24:06,050
And in the early days of the Internet
we were trying to figure how to do

396
00:24:06,051 --> 00:24:06,920
security.
We,

397
00:24:07,160 --> 00:24:10,820
we were trying to figure out who we could
talk to and the only people we could

398
00:24:10,821 --> 00:24:14,960
find to talk to, this is 1970s
what's the national security agency?

399
00:24:16,130 --> 00:24:19,190
And we went down there and said help
us think through network security.

400
00:24:19,820 --> 00:24:24,140
They only had one concern,
which was disclosure control.

401
00:24:25,070 --> 00:24:27,380
They said, you know, if the spy
steals the stuff it's gone man.

402
00:24:27,381 --> 00:24:32,381
So you got to just have a hundred percent
attention to disclosure control and

403
00:24:33,411 --> 00:24:35,400
what that meant. And by the
way, the integrity on the unit,

404
00:24:35,401 --> 00:24:36,710
it's really easy because what comes out,

405
00:24:36,711 --> 00:24:41,300
it's supposed to be what goes in
and you can usually tell. So so,

406
00:24:41,330 --> 00:24:44,120
but their attitude was, you know,
if you think you've got a data leak,

407
00:24:44,121 --> 00:24:45,080
just turn the network off.

408
00:24:45,081 --> 00:24:47,990
Cause it was not at the time
operationally central to what they do.

409
00:24:48,800 --> 00:24:53,800
So there's a tremendous gravitational
pull to confidentiality or disclosure

410
00:24:55,281 --> 00:24:59,600
control. But there are three elements to
this story. There's disclosure control,

411
00:25:00,050 --> 00:25:03,650
there is integrity,
integrity and there's availability.

412
00:25:04,130 --> 00:25:05,930
It's called the CIA triad,

413
00:25:05,960 --> 00:25:09,380
which is not to be confused with
the Central Intelligence Agency and

414
00:25:10,100 --> 00:25:12,410
availability is an element of security.

415
00:25:13,340 --> 00:25:17,810
You can't solve availability by
sprinkling crypto on it. It doesn't work.

416
00:25:18,410 --> 00:25:23,410
Availability involves using
resources that are trustworthy.

417
00:25:24,380 --> 00:25:26,480
If there's a DNS sending
you to the wrong place,

418
00:25:26,481 --> 00:25:28,820
you have to be able to know
enough to stop using it.

419
00:25:29,420 --> 00:25:33,170
If you're being routed through an
inappropriate part of the internet,

420
00:25:33,171 --> 00:25:36,040
you have to be able to avoid it.
Have,

421
00:25:36,560 --> 00:25:41,090
we do not have in computer science
a general theory of availability.

422
00:25:42,500 --> 00:25:46,070
But if you look at what my
security friends have done,

423
00:25:46,490 --> 00:25:48,860
they have paid a great deal
of attention to disclosure,

424
00:25:48,861 --> 00:25:53,660
control and integrity and they have
absolutely screwed up availability.

425
00:25:54,650 --> 00:25:59,390
I had, I had an interesting
little annoying a fat the
other day in which I was,

426
00:25:59,930 --> 00:26:00,763
uh,

427
00:26:01,130 --> 00:26:06,130
trying to download a update of a
python module and I went to the,

428
00:26:06,291 --> 00:26:08,740
did all the thing, you know, pip
install, whatever the hell your type,

429
00:26:08,750 --> 00:26:13,610
I don't remember what your type, and the
thing came back and it said, uh, the,

430
00:26:13,730 --> 00:26:17,870
the certificate, the signing
certificate for the code is invalid.

431
00:26:17,871 --> 00:26:21,770
It's probably out of date and so
you can't download the module.

432
00:26:24,990 --> 00:26:28,340
I said, what? What's plan B?

433
00:26:29,630 --> 00:26:32,390
There was no plan B.
You can't download the module.

434
00:26:33,020 --> 00:26:36,350
And I'm sure my security friends
thought good day's work. Okay.

435
00:26:36,980 --> 00:26:38,570
We provided with very,

436
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:43,720
very low probability that almost certainly
there's a was out of date because the

437
00:26:44,071 --> 00:26:45,910
guy's an idiot and you didn't
update it. It's like, you know,

438
00:26:45,911 --> 00:26:49,770
there's 0% chance that it
was actually a malicious,

439
00:26:50,100 --> 00:26:51,180
but they stopped me cold.

440
00:26:51,990 --> 00:26:56,990
Now my attitude is they carried out a
100% successful security related to tackle

441
00:26:57,001 --> 00:26:59,280
me along the dimension of availability

442
00:27:01,020 --> 00:27:03,990
and consumers. I'm sorry,
I hate that word. Users.

443
00:27:04,620 --> 00:27:07,410
What they want to do is get their
job done and we keep saying,

444
00:27:07,440 --> 00:27:09,660
why do people click through
these warning boxes?

445
00:27:09,661 --> 00:27:13,080
Nevermind that the warning boxes are
and explicable that click through them

446
00:27:13,290 --> 00:27:14,670
because they have to get their job done.

447
00:27:15,690 --> 00:27:19,800
And anybody who is designed a security
system which stops the user dead,

448
00:27:19,801 --> 00:27:23,460
it doesn't give them a plan.
B has failed security one on one,

449
00:27:23,700 --> 00:27:27,990
but that's not the way we teach it because
we focus on integrity and disclosure

450
00:27:27,991 --> 00:27:32,400
control. And so we sprinkled crypto on
everything and hope it's done a flame off.

451
00:27:33,380 --> 00:27:36,240
Um, the other thing I wanted
to say about security,

452
00:27:36,270 --> 00:27:38,490
and there's a long chapter about this is

453
00:27:40,530 --> 00:27:45,370
this idea of being attacked.
I can attach to a website, uh,

454
00:27:46,080 --> 00:27:47,490
it sends me malware.

455
00:27:49,050 --> 00:27:52,740
Some of my friends who are
very technical say, yeah,

456
00:27:52,741 --> 00:27:56,730
we really have to focus on the correct
implementation of out of applications.

457
00:27:57,260 --> 00:27:59,460
You know, they too can have
buffer overruns. Oh my God,

458
00:27:59,461 --> 00:28:04,110
don't tell me about another buffer
overrun. The misbehavior you get,

459
00:28:04,140 --> 00:28:07,890
let us say in the web today is not
because of implementation bugs.

460
00:28:08,400 --> 00:28:12,480
It's because of bad design. No, I'm
sorry I won't take back. Not Bad.

461
00:28:12,900 --> 00:28:14,910
Because of deliberate design decisions.

462
00:28:16,530 --> 00:28:21,210
That is to say the way the system
functions is insecure by design.

463
00:28:22,260 --> 00:28:26,400
Now that shouldn't surprise you because
it's very hard to imagine anything as

464
00:28:26,401 --> 00:28:29,550
complicated as the web that doesn't
have risky modalities. I mean,

465
00:28:29,551 --> 00:28:31,110
I can hit somebody over
the head with a hammer.

466
00:28:31,111 --> 00:28:34,440
So the risk of modalities in the web,
or not surprising,

467
00:28:34,441 --> 00:28:39,441
but in fact conscious decisions were taken
to put functionality into the web was

468
00:28:40,441 --> 00:28:41,340
known to be risky.

469
00:28:42,180 --> 00:28:46,080
When the idea of downloading
active code first came up,

470
00:28:46,350 --> 00:28:49,590
every security person I knew was
standing on the sideline saying,

471
00:28:49,591 --> 00:28:52,380
that's the stupidest idea I've ever heard.
You're all going to die.

472
00:28:52,381 --> 00:28:53,214
You're all going to die.

473
00:28:53,460 --> 00:28:57,420
Why would you download code from
somebody that you don't low?

474
00:28:57,570 --> 00:29:01,740
No know. We tell our kids don't
take cookies from strangers.

475
00:29:01,741 --> 00:29:05,430
Why would you take code from a stranger
and run it on your computer and I,

476
00:29:05,431 --> 00:29:08,430
we actually talked to Nsa about this
and they said inspecting code to see

477
00:29:08,431 --> 00:29:10,140
whether it's malicious as a fool's errand.

478
00:29:10,800 --> 00:29:15,800
The only way you can reliably
have downloads of active
code is that you have a

479
00:29:15,901 --> 00:29:18,090
very clear sense of whether
the senders trustworthy.

480
00:29:18,810 --> 00:29:20,700
You've got to be embedded
in a space of trust,

481
00:29:22,080 --> 00:29:25,770
but if we have risky
modalities in the applications,

482
00:29:27,390 --> 00:29:29,730
you can't expect the
packet layer to fix that.

483
00:29:30,840 --> 00:29:35,790
The application guys have to fix this
and they have to take the responsibility

484
00:29:35,791 --> 00:29:38,730
for understanding how
to balance this feature,

485
00:29:38,760 --> 00:29:41,860
feature rich space that everybody loves.
You know,

486
00:29:41,861 --> 00:29:45,130
what did you get for downloading codes?
My God, you've got Flash, you've got,

487
00:29:45,450 --> 00:29:49,350
you know, animated dancing cats
and it, boy, that's worth it. Um,

488
00:29:50,860 --> 00:29:55,720
against the security risks.
And it is an application problem,

489
00:29:55,721 --> 00:29:58,630
but that's not something that is
understood when you go to Washington.

490
00:29:58,631 --> 00:30:00,370
They say the Internet's broken,
fix it,

491
00:30:01,920 --> 00:30:04,960
and you get some draconian
ideas in Washington,

492
00:30:04,961 --> 00:30:07,150
some of which I hope I
have helped to stamp out.

493
00:30:08,050 --> 00:30:12,850
I had a Senate staffer a while back
say to me, this sounds like nonsense,

494
00:30:12,851 --> 00:30:15,550
but you understand exactly
what he was saying. He said,

495
00:30:15,551 --> 00:30:19,960
why don't packets have license plates?
And I know what he meant.

496
00:30:20,680 --> 00:30:25,030
He meant why isn't there some identifier
in a packet that a third party like a

497
00:30:25,031 --> 00:30:29,050
policeman can look at to
unambiguously understand who sent it.

498
00:30:30,130 --> 00:30:34,390
Okay. Why are all actions on the
Internet accountable to a person?

499
00:30:36,700 --> 00:30:40,480
Well, I mean, there are lots of good
answers to that. One of which is socially,

500
00:30:40,481 --> 00:30:42,730
it's a terrible idea.
Um,

501
00:30:42,850 --> 00:30:45,580
it eliminates any possibility of
anonymous action on the Internet.

502
00:30:45,581 --> 00:30:49,120
And I think there's a space for
anonymous action. Uh, furthermore,

503
00:30:49,121 --> 00:30:51,100
who would issue those
identities in a global world?

504
00:30:52,300 --> 00:30:55,450
Almost certainly sovereign states
would assert their right to issue those

505
00:30:55,451 --> 00:30:55,971
identities.

506
00:30:55,971 --> 00:30:59,410
So what would it mean if I have a
packet that goes by and it says that the

507
00:30:59,411 --> 00:31:00,910
identity of this,
of this,

508
00:31:00,911 --> 00:31:04,000
the sender of this package is verified
by the sovereign state of Iran.

509
00:31:05,230 --> 00:31:07,810
Do I feel better now? You know, so,

510
00:31:08,710 --> 00:31:11,200
but if you don't have an accountable
internet, what do you have?

511
00:31:12,070 --> 00:31:15,190
And there's been very little
attention paid to this. So, um,

512
00:31:15,340 --> 00:31:18,730
although my book is about Internet,

513
00:31:18,731 --> 00:31:21,610
I actually spend a certain amount
of time talking about applications.

514
00:31:21,611 --> 00:31:26,050
And one of the projects we're currently
doing it MIT is to see whether we can

515
00:31:26,051 --> 00:31:31,051
think in a more methodical way about how
to help application designers deal with

516
00:31:31,421 --> 00:31:36,010
this tradeoff between embedding risky
actions because their feature rich and

517
00:31:36,011 --> 00:31:39,460
dealing with the fact you only want to
use them in a context where the people

518
00:31:39,461 --> 00:31:40,960
you're communicating with you trust.

519
00:31:41,680 --> 00:31:44,980
So the book has some
of my personal history.

520
00:31:44,981 --> 00:31:49,981
I talk about stories from
the two thousands as well
as the 19 hundreds and 2000

521
00:31:50,321 --> 00:31:52,110
and ten's a,

522
00:31:52,120 --> 00:31:56,260
there's a chapter on what does
it mean for a network to be,

523
00:31:56,410 --> 00:32:00,220
to meet the needs of society,
chapter on requirements.

524
00:32:00,470 --> 00:32:04,240
And we have one on management as I
said, availability, security, longevity.

525
00:32:04,690 --> 00:32:07,990
And then there was a discussion in
the book of alternative. So why,

526
00:32:08,470 --> 00:32:09,640
and I'm going to stop in a second.

527
00:32:10,420 --> 00:32:13,870
Why are people proposing
alternatives to the Internet?

528
00:32:14,230 --> 00:32:16,540
It actually does what it does pretty well.

529
00:32:16,850 --> 00:32:19,300
What it does is move packets
for machine a to machine B.

530
00:32:20,050 --> 00:32:24,670
The reason they're proposing alternatives
is because they wanted to do something

531
00:32:24,671 --> 00:32:25,001
different,

532
00:32:25,001 --> 00:32:28,780
not because they think it could do
exactly what it does better than it does.

533
00:32:29,740 --> 00:32:33,820
And they want to put more features in
because that's what engineers always want

534
00:32:33,821 --> 00:32:35,680
to do.
They want to add features.

535
00:32:36,450 --> 00:32:40,340
Every people here familiar with the
expression, second system syndrome.

536
00:32:42,500 --> 00:32:45,380
It's when you built up system that sort
of does something pretty well and you

537
00:32:45,381 --> 00:32:46,430
say,
I'm going to build a second one,

538
00:32:46,431 --> 00:32:51,200
it's going to do everything
and they'll fail. Okay. Um,

539
00:32:51,920 --> 00:32:55,190
so what have they talked about putting in?
Well,

540
00:32:55,400 --> 00:32:57,510
one thing that they've
talked about adding isn't,

541
00:32:58,370 --> 00:32:59,960
well you send a packet to a machine,

542
00:32:59,961 --> 00:33:01,610
but most people don't
want to get to a machine.

543
00:33:01,611 --> 00:33:04,610
They want to get to a service that's
on the machine or they want to get some

544
00:33:04,611 --> 00:33:05,750
information on the machine.

545
00:33:06,020 --> 00:33:09,830
So why don't we tell the network what
service you're trying to get to or why

546
00:33:09,831 --> 00:33:12,200
don't we tell the network and what
information you're trying to get through?

547
00:33:12,201 --> 00:33:14,300
Why don't package to have the
names of information in them.

548
00:33:14,750 --> 00:33:16,670
This is an idea that's been
around for a long time.

549
00:33:16,671 --> 00:33:20,870
I think it was first proposed around
1995 by David Cheriton, I think.

550
00:33:21,490 --> 00:33:25,640
Uh, it now goes by the name of information
centric networking and it creates a

551
00:33:25,641 --> 00:33:29,150
really interesting problem. How do you
build a routing protocol that can run,

552
00:33:29,660 --> 00:33:32,930
that can route to a few billion things
as opposed to the Internet today,

553
00:33:32,931 --> 00:33:35,510
which is routing to a few million things.
Uh,

554
00:33:36,590 --> 00:33:38,120
but that's not the real
interesting question.

555
00:33:38,480 --> 00:33:42,890
The interesting question is do you
want to give, do you Mr Google,

556
00:33:43,220 --> 00:33:44,870
do you want to give to the network,

557
00:33:45,650 --> 00:33:49,970
the control over where the network goes
to retrieve a copy for mentioned piece

558
00:33:49,971 --> 00:33:53,720
of information or do you want to
keep that control inside your firm?

559
00:33:55,430 --> 00:34:00,430
Protocol design is actually over industry
structure and balance of power and

560
00:34:02,841 --> 00:34:06,590
there's a lot of discussion this in the
book that adding more features to the

561
00:34:06,591 --> 00:34:08,930
network may in fact be
empowering the wrong person,

562
00:34:08,960 --> 00:34:13,400
whether it's a state that would like to
carry out surveillance or an ISP that

563
00:34:13,401 --> 00:34:17,390
might like to manipulate to get
money across that money insulator.

564
00:34:18,320 --> 00:34:22,610
And uh, the future is not
being defined by technology.

565
00:34:22,730 --> 00:34:25,640
The future is being defined by
these forces, economic forces,

566
00:34:25,641 --> 00:34:30,400
political considerations, contention
in the industrial space. And,

567
00:34:30,610 --> 00:34:33,260
and that's why I'm no longer
running a purely technical group,

568
00:34:33,261 --> 00:34:34,830
but I think I should stop
and take questions from.

569
00:34:35,750 --> 00:34:39,200
I had heard some interesting stories
about how they originally set up protocols

570
00:34:39,201 --> 00:34:43,400
between the big eyes, peas to transfer
packets between each other. Um,

571
00:34:43,730 --> 00:34:46,100
I had heard that the fact that it zero

572
00:34:48,140 --> 00:34:51,480
zero cost between them was an interesting
story. Have you heard that one? Okay.

573
00:34:52,250 --> 00:34:53,800
And in the original structure,

574
00:34:53,940 --> 00:34:58,440
the Internet, little ISP bought
service from big eyes please.

575
00:34:58,441 --> 00:35:01,050
We call that surface trends that other
people might call it long distance.

576
00:35:01,410 --> 00:35:02,850
You pay them and they get you everywhere.

577
00:35:03,390 --> 00:35:07,380
But the ISP is that are at the top half
to interconnect in order to exchange

578
00:35:07,381 --> 00:35:10,110
traffic with each other. Now that's
not getting to the whole Internet.

579
00:35:10,710 --> 00:35:11,790
That's just getting to,

580
00:35:11,940 --> 00:35:13,890
I want to get to your customers
and you want to get to mine.

581
00:35:14,520 --> 00:35:17,160
And there is an apocryphal story
which I think is in the book,

582
00:35:17,220 --> 00:35:18,600
but it's an apocryphal story.

583
00:35:18,840 --> 00:35:23,840
I can't figure out whether it's true
that those first few commercial wide area

584
00:35:25,831 --> 00:35:29,250
Internet providers had to figure out the
business terms of which they were going

585
00:35:29,251 --> 00:35:29,840
to interconnect.

586
00:35:29,840 --> 00:35:32,280
They understood the technical terms on
which they were the business terms of the

587
00:35:32,281 --> 00:35:35,730
issue and they got together and there
was a conversation and at one point,

588
00:35:36,480 --> 00:35:40,710
so the goes, one of the
guys in the room said, oh,

589
00:35:41,430 --> 00:35:45,360
I thought you were going to pay me
money. And it's, it's comforting.

590
00:35:45,370 --> 00:35:48,150
It's complicated when you're having a
conversation with somebody and you're

591
00:35:48,151 --> 00:35:50,460
bargaining and you don't even know
which way the money's going to go.

592
00:35:51,810 --> 00:35:55,720
Friend of mine totally broke a car
dealer. It was just amazing. He,

593
00:35:55,850 --> 00:35:58,140
he wanted to buy a new car and
so he was trading in a used car,

594
00:35:58,141 --> 00:36:01,770
but his mother had recently reached
that age where she can no longer drive.

595
00:36:01,771 --> 00:36:04,920
So they actually, it was trading
at two cars to buy a new car.

596
00:36:05,220 --> 00:36:06,390
And when they worked out the bargain,

597
00:36:07,320 --> 00:36:11,460
he got the car and the dealer had to
give him money and the dealer said,

598
00:36:12,480 --> 00:36:15,870
you just broke my brain. I understand
the math, but if I give you the car,

599
00:36:15,871 --> 00:36:16,800
you're supposed to give me money.

600
00:36:17,190 --> 00:36:20,010
The idea that I'm giving you the car and
I'm giving you by just opted. Totally.

601
00:36:20,340 --> 00:36:22,530
So there's a conversation in which
somebody said, wait a minute,

602
00:36:22,531 --> 00:36:27,090
I thought the money was going to go the
other way. And so as the story goes,

603
00:36:27,091 --> 00:36:31,350
all of a sudden the people in the room
who were technical businessman suddenly

604
00:36:31,351 --> 00:36:33,960
realized that if they let
the lawyers in the room,

605
00:36:33,961 --> 00:36:36,240
there will be a three or negotiation.
And so they stood up and said,

606
00:36:36,241 --> 00:36:39,780
quick before the lawyers get here, I don't
pay you, you don't pay me shake hands.

607
00:36:39,781 --> 00:36:42,840
We interconnect, let's
get outta here. And thus,

608
00:36:42,880 --> 00:36:46,590
so it is said revenue neutral
period was born. Yeah,

609
00:36:47,070 --> 00:36:49,080
that's been disputed
over and over over again.

610
00:36:49,560 --> 00:36:53,640
The latest dispute of course being whether
people like Google and Netflix have

611
00:36:53,641 --> 00:36:56,490
to pay to interconnect with
ISP. And that was, you know,

612
00:36:56,491 --> 00:36:59,790
a fee three years ago was
a serious nasty dispute,

613
00:36:59,791 --> 00:37:02,550
which led to lots of congestion on
the Internet. Some other questions?

614
00:37:03,920 --> 00:37:08,540
Sure. So there's two pieces. One
is when you talk about security,

615
00:37:08,541 --> 00:37:13,250
one of the more recent excitement's at
least for inches around the tls 1.3 right?

616
00:37:13,610 --> 00:37:18,610
It has been the conflict between end
to end security and folks who are,

617
00:37:20,901 --> 00:37:21,351
for instance,

618
00:37:21,351 --> 00:37:24,800
running a data center and need to know
what's going on in their data center or

619
00:37:24,801 --> 00:37:27,500
wanting to based. So
there's, there's end to end,

620
00:37:27,501 --> 00:37:30,080
but then there's also you're
running across my equipment.

621
00:37:30,081 --> 00:37:35,060
I need to know what you're doing or
what's being done so that bad actors can't

622
00:37:35,061 --> 00:37:40,010
come in. Um, and then another piece
of somewhat correlated to this,

623
00:37:40,011 --> 00:37:45,011
I'm curious to your viewpoints is the
tussle that's going on now between network

624
00:37:46,761 --> 00:37:51,761
management and visibility versus it's
just so pervasive encryption versus being

625
00:37:54,141 --> 00:37:59,141
able to manage the networks in a
reasonable fashion and how to um,

626
00:38:00,530 --> 00:38:01,730
manage that discussion.

627
00:38:02,180 --> 00:38:04,820
I don't have definitive answers
to either one of those questions.

628
00:38:04,821 --> 00:38:09,290
The questions are very well formed
when when a data center says,

629
00:38:09,320 --> 00:38:11,300
I want to be able to
see what you're doing,

630
00:38:11,301 --> 00:38:14,860
I want to be able to see what people
are doing or, or some actresses,

631
00:38:14,861 --> 00:38:16,130
I want to be able to
see what you're doing.

632
00:38:17,480 --> 00:38:21,050
That is the fundamental tension.
Who is,

633
00:38:21,350 --> 00:38:25,070
who is responsible for protecting me?

634
00:38:25,580 --> 00:38:29,550
If I'm talking to you and I trust
you and you and I have an encrypted

635
00:38:29,630 --> 00:38:30,463
conversation,

636
00:38:31,520 --> 00:38:35,830
I don't want a third party looking at
what we're doing now am messing up their

637
00:38:35,831 --> 00:38:38,890
system. Well that's an issue
that they have to police.

638
00:38:38,891 --> 00:38:41,680
Do they have to see exactly what I'm
sending to see whether they're messing up

639
00:38:41,681 --> 00:38:44,800
the situation?
If I think you may be attacking me,

640
00:38:45,640 --> 00:38:49,630
then Indian encryption is the whole
wrong idea. I mean, I can explain,

641
00:38:49,631 --> 00:38:54,010
I explained this, uh, by a real world
analogy, if you're sending me letters,

642
00:38:54,760 --> 00:38:57,610
you probably assume that you don't
want somebody opening those letters.

643
00:38:57,610 --> 00:39:01,300
But if you think they're full of anthrax,
then all of a sudden it's, oh, I do want.

644
00:39:01,301 --> 00:39:01,631
So yeah.

645
00:39:01,631 --> 00:39:04,900
And I want them addressed in a hazmat
suit and well trained and they know

646
00:39:04,901 --> 00:39:05,920
exactly how to deal with it.

647
00:39:06,400 --> 00:39:10,780
And that in fact is the tension between
two of the fundamental security goals

648
00:39:10,781 --> 00:39:13,720
that you and I ought to be able to have
a secure conversation if we trust each

649
00:39:13,721 --> 00:39:14,440
other.

650
00:39:14,440 --> 00:39:18,340
And I would be lovely to have a third
party to protect me if I think you're

651
00:39:18,341 --> 00:39:19,174
going to attack me.

652
00:39:19,780 --> 00:39:23,860
And the transition there is not
under the control of a third party.

653
00:39:24,100 --> 00:39:28,180
It should be my decision about whether
I trust you or my decision about whether

654
00:39:28,181 --> 00:39:31,100
I would like a trusted third party
protecting the transaction. Okay.

655
00:39:31,450 --> 00:39:35,050
So I don't want people
unilaterally saying, my job is to,

656
00:39:35,080 --> 00:39:37,970
is to look at everything you're doing.
I want him to say, Hey, I want to,

657
00:39:38,050 --> 00:39:40,060
I want you to do something for you.
I don't trust this person.

658
00:39:40,570 --> 00:39:43,660
Now the question of
network management that's,

659
00:39:43,720 --> 00:39:48,220
that's come up again and
again and again and I'm, I,

660
00:39:48,240 --> 00:39:53,240
I have to say I am reasonably
not sympathetic to the
more extreme arguments that

661
00:39:54,731 --> 00:39:58,750
say I have to be able to see everything
you can do. So at management manage it.

662
00:39:59,290 --> 00:40:02,650
I think in particular what's going on in
the mobile networks today where they're

663
00:40:02,651 --> 00:40:07,651
recoding the video and doing all this
kind of stuff reflects the fact that we

664
00:40:11,230 --> 00:40:16,180
made some bad engineering decisions.
And the,

665
00:40:16,840 --> 00:40:21,840
the incredible capacity we have in the
wireline network is not matched by the

666
00:40:22,451 --> 00:40:25,660
capacity we have. It doesn't,
you know, the wireless network,

667
00:40:25,840 --> 00:40:27,340
they're just capacity constrained.

668
00:40:27,341 --> 00:40:29,650
And so they say we have to
engineer our way out of this.

669
00:40:30,250 --> 00:40:35,250
And because there is this barrier between
what the application guys are prepared

670
00:40:36,731 --> 00:40:41,290
to do and what the network has
to do, the system is, again,

671
00:40:41,291 --> 00:40:44,200
there are these protocol interfaces.
They have to say,

672
00:40:44,201 --> 00:40:47,890
well I have to fix these problems but
I sort of have to fix them on my own.

673
00:40:47,891 --> 00:40:50,650
So I'm going to try to figure out what
you're doing and trans coded and all this

674
00:40:50,651 --> 00:40:54,910
kind of thing. And the wireless guys for
a long time I've been saying, you know,

675
00:40:54,911 --> 00:40:56,200
this layered model sucks

676
00:40:57,730 --> 00:41:01,210
because if we had better integration
between what the application guys did and

677
00:41:01,211 --> 00:41:02,050
what the network did,

678
00:41:02,620 --> 00:41:05,980
then in fact the application guys could
do a better job of helping us manage our

679
00:41:05,981 --> 00:41:06,670
network.

680
00:41:06,670 --> 00:41:11,170
But those are different firms and they
may actually be in competition with each

681
00:41:11,171 --> 00:41:14,230
other. So in the end,
there's a technical problem,

682
00:41:14,231 --> 00:41:17,620
which is a lack of standards to
create cross layer of coordination.

683
00:41:18,400 --> 00:41:23,400
But there's also a tension
between companies that in
fact have Evers interests.

684
00:41:25,150 --> 00:41:30,150
And I don't believe we should sacrifice
and to insecurity as a stop gap there.

685
00:41:32,681 --> 00:41:36,900
We should force people to solve the
problem the right way, which is to say,

686
00:41:36,901 --> 00:41:41,340
let's build new protocols that go
across layer that provides the transfer

687
00:41:41,490 --> 00:41:43,230
performance information across layers.

688
00:41:43,640 --> 00:41:45,240
This woman looks like
she wants to mic back.

689
00:41:45,810 --> 00:41:49,590
I saw her reaching out
for it. Sorry. Yes, yes.

690
00:41:49,680 --> 00:41:52,840
I completely agree that one
shouldn't sacrifice. Yeah.

691
00:41:53,460 --> 00:41:54,293
Hm.

692
00:41:54,360 --> 00:41:58,200
But there's a challenge both in
it going the other direction.

693
00:41:58,440 --> 00:42:02,490
And also if we want to have protocols
communicating between the applications to

694
00:42:02,491 --> 00:42:06,390
the network, then it becomes a
trust but verify kind of challenge.

695
00:42:06,720 --> 00:42:09,750
And what information do you
want to put in? Like with quick,

696
00:42:09,751 --> 00:42:11,370
there was a whole discussion about,
you know,

697
00:42:11,640 --> 00:42:15,480
is it safe to expose a single
bit of information that
can be used to determine a

698
00:42:15,481 --> 00:42:17,130
round trip times,
right?

699
00:42:17,160 --> 00:42:20,790
So there's a challenge
of what information is,

700
00:42:20,970 --> 00:42:24,720
how do you agree on what information is
safe to expose to the network and how

701
00:42:24,721 --> 00:42:29,721
does the network trust that information
from the application when there's not a

702
00:42:30,120 --> 00:42:35,120
potentially cost or economic or other
type of challenge to requesting as much as

703
00:42:36,481 --> 00:42:37,314
you want.

704
00:42:37,880 --> 00:42:41,680
And that's uh,
and that's a very tricky one because

705
00:42:43,480 --> 00:42:46,480
there's, there's no venue in which
we could have that discussion today

706
00:42:48,810 --> 00:42:53,400
if you, if you go to the ITF. Yes.
Although I, ETF is slowly shifting.

707
00:42:53,850 --> 00:42:57,270
They're incredibly uncomfortable
having a conversation.

708
00:42:57,960 --> 00:43:01,950
Whose motivation is relates to,
what am I call the industry structure?

709
00:43:04,810 --> 00:43:06,500
Um,
the,

710
00:43:09,610 --> 00:43:13,130
do you disagree? I think there's
some pieces that are shifting there.

711
00:43:13,190 --> 00:43:16,280
There are pieces that are
shifting. I agree with that, but,

712
00:43:16,700 --> 00:43:20,360
but to have a conversation
in which different actors
with adverse interests get

713
00:43:20,361 --> 00:43:22,560
together and design a protocol is a,

714
00:43:23,040 --> 00:43:28,040
is a very tricky thing and need some very
fair minded people who are sitting in

715
00:43:28,071 --> 00:43:30,050
the middle too basic to try
to arbitrate this thing.

716
00:43:30,051 --> 00:43:34,560
And I don't think we have the structure
to try and make that happen today. Um,

717
00:43:34,910 --> 00:43:38,570
I certainly ran into that. I've run into
that over the years, multiple times.

718
00:43:39,460 --> 00:43:40,293
Uh,

719
00:43:40,780 --> 00:43:43,270
well let's take some other questions.
I saw somebody with a hand over here.

720
00:43:43,930 --> 00:43:48,650
So you mentioned, um, uh,
the insecurity of BGP. Um,

721
00:43:49,510 --> 00:43:54,510
as an example of innocence where you
have a problem where you would need

722
00:43:54,670 --> 00:43:59,670
multiple ISP to adopting
technology to improve something.

723
00:44:00,310 --> 00:44:03,540
But if just one, if you have just
one on board, it doesn't, yeah,

724
00:44:03,550 --> 00:44:06,610
it doesn't get you anywhere and so they
don't want to be the first one. Do you,

725
00:44:06,611 --> 00:44:08,620
so in that case or anything similar,

726
00:44:08,621 --> 00:44:13,330
do you think there's any possibility of
positive progress being made with like

727
00:44:13,600 --> 00:44:15,340
government regulation saying,
Hey,

728
00:44:15,341 --> 00:44:20,341
buy by 2025 you all need to support SPG
p if you're going to operate in America

729
00:44:20,381 --> 00:44:22,630
for instance. Or is
that, is that a dead end?

730
00:44:23,070 --> 00:44:26,100
The question is how much does,
does it help if we do it domestically?

731
00:44:28,320 --> 00:44:30,330
Uh, you know, if,

732
00:44:31,110 --> 00:44:34,230
if traffic from a Google site ends
up in Russia because something,

733
00:44:34,590 --> 00:44:37,170
some packet which was either
erroneous or malicious,

734
00:44:37,540 --> 00:44:42,450
it emerges from Nigeria. You
know, what does, what does,

735
00:44:42,451 --> 00:44:43,021
I'd probably,

736
00:44:43,021 --> 00:44:45,990
the traffic was not originated in that
Google traffic was not originating in the

737
00:44:45,991 --> 00:44:48,990
United States. It was originating get
a Google cache somewhere in Europe.

738
00:44:48,991 --> 00:44:52,020
I don't know where I'm,
on the other hand,

739
00:44:52,021 --> 00:44:55,020
you could say at least we could secure
the domestic experience and maybe when

740
00:44:55,021 --> 00:44:59,520
people go overseas they should understand
that it's going to get worse. I think,

741
00:45:00,280 --> 00:45:04,580
well, let me, let me
give you an analogy. Uh,

742
00:45:06,540 --> 00:45:07,020
when we,

743
00:45:07,020 --> 00:45:10,440
when we came to understand that there
were certain certificate authorities that

744
00:45:10,441 --> 00:45:11,340
were not trustworthy.

745
00:45:12,070 --> 00:45:17,070
I think the Chinese a subsidiary that
was issuing fake certificates saying the

746
00:45:17,141 --> 00:45:20,070
Google's over here in
Facebook's over here, you can't,

747
00:45:20,100 --> 00:45:23,280
you can't wear the sovereign state of
China. We're going to do whatever we want.

748
00:45:23,850 --> 00:45:26,100
You know? And they don't
necessarily say, and by the way,

749
00:45:26,460 --> 00:45:27,540
we don't like it very much,

750
00:45:27,541 --> 00:45:31,170
but the implication there is if
we're going to attack Google,

751
00:45:31,171 --> 00:45:33,420
that's our sovereign, you know,
what are we going to do? Okay.

752
00:45:34,110 --> 00:45:38,700
So what you guys proposed was certificate
transparency and the idea behind

753
00:45:38,701 --> 00:45:41,970
certificate transparency
is you can issue you,

754
00:45:41,971 --> 00:45:44,340
Mr China can issue any
certificates you want,

755
00:45:45,630 --> 00:45:49,410
but you have to put it into the
public log so that anybody can see it.

756
00:45:49,620 --> 00:45:52,890
And our browser won't honor that
certificate unless it's also in the log.

757
00:45:52,891 --> 00:45:57,060
So you can lie, but you can't lie
in private. And we're putting,

758
00:45:57,061 --> 00:45:58,440
using social discipline,

759
00:45:58,830 --> 00:46:03,830
which is actually a better way to try to
discipline a trust space than technical

760
00:46:04,141 --> 00:46:05,620
tools.
Okay.

761
00:46:06,450 --> 00:46:09,990
And some of the most interesting
proposals to deal with BGP do not involve

762
00:46:10,230 --> 00:46:14,370
adding SBG p or something like this.
They involve various kinds of public logs,

763
00:46:15,120 --> 00:46:17,100
which if you choose to put something in,

764
00:46:17,101 --> 00:46:21,660
it will make your world better.
If I check it.

765
00:46:22,080 --> 00:46:26,100
So, and it becomes voluntary,
it's, you know, so, so I think,

766
00:46:26,101 --> 00:46:30,030
I think the way we're moving is probably
not to have continuing fights over

767
00:46:30,150 --> 00:46:33,420
secure BGP, secure origin,
PGP, all that stuff,

768
00:46:33,990 --> 00:46:36,000
but perhaps something
that sits alongside it,

769
00:46:36,001 --> 00:46:38,860
which is a kind of a
log system in which the,

770
00:46:39,130 --> 00:46:42,600
the actors that are
interested in improving their
security have an action they

771
00:46:42,601 --> 00:46:46,350
can take. That is to say it's in
their interest. So we don't have this,

772
00:46:46,590 --> 00:46:47,880
this misaligned interests,

773
00:46:48,420 --> 00:46:50,850
but I think that's the way to
make progress in this space.

774
00:46:52,100 --> 00:46:54,660
And I apologize to the
sounds like trolling,

775
00:46:54,661 --> 00:46:57,440
but when you say public log
to be in blockchain, no,

776
00:46:57,650 --> 00:47:00,120
they look at what Google has done
with certificate transparency.

777
00:47:00,570 --> 00:47:04,710
It is not blockchain. Google is
saying, trust me. Actually they're not.

778
00:47:04,860 --> 00:47:07,620
They're saying trust. Any two
people trust any two organizations,

779
00:47:07,621 --> 00:47:11,400
one of which is Google the, the
certificate of the, the, the,

780
00:47:11,450 --> 00:47:16,030
the certificate transparency log.
You have to write your, your,

781
00:47:16,060 --> 00:47:18,420
your assertion in either the
figure of the room into two logs,

782
00:47:18,421 --> 00:47:21,300
one of which does not belong to one
to one. It belongs to Google. So no,

783
00:47:21,301 --> 00:47:22,440
it doesn't not have to be blockchain.

784
00:47:23,640 --> 00:47:27,600
Blockchain to me in almost
all cases is overkill.

785
00:47:28,710 --> 00:47:31,270
Whether you think it's a good idea at all.
To me blockchain is a,

786
00:47:31,330 --> 00:47:33,660
is an example of somebody
trying to design,

787
00:47:33,670 --> 00:47:36,880
I was talking about applications
that have risky modalities.

788
00:47:37,330 --> 00:47:41,710
To me blockchain is an example of
somebody trying to build a restricted

789
00:47:41,711 --> 00:47:43,000
application functionality

790
00:47:44,680 --> 00:47:48,220
into a system in which
nobody has to trust anybody.

791
00:47:50,330 --> 00:47:52,890
You know, I can do look
at the basics. It's,

792
00:47:52,891 --> 00:47:57,400
it's like you're going to pay me money
right now and you and I have to have no

793
00:47:57,401 --> 00:47:59,560
trust in each other whatsoever
because we trust the mechanism.

794
00:47:59,561 --> 00:48:04,090
It's a purely technical solution to
creating a trustworthy transaction into

795
00:48:04,091 --> 00:48:08,560
trust free space. And the real
world doesn't usually work that way.

796
00:48:09,390 --> 00:48:10,223
You know,
the,

797
00:48:10,420 --> 00:48:13,990
the world actually works much more
efficiently because it's willing to make a

798
00:48:13,991 --> 00:48:17,900
few trust assumptions. And I dunno
what China thinks about Google,

799
00:48:17,901 --> 00:48:19,990
but most people are willing
to believe that the,

800
00:48:20,130 --> 00:48:22,600
that the certificate transparency
log that Google runs,

801
00:48:22,601 --> 00:48:27,310
which in fact is blockchain in the
sense that it's forward change.

802
00:48:27,311 --> 00:48:30,460
You can't go back and change things.
It's not a literally a block chain,

803
00:48:30,461 --> 00:48:34,840
but it's a for retaining protocol
and it's done. The, by the way,

804
00:48:34,841 --> 00:48:37,720
the reason Google did that
is to protect themselves.

805
00:48:39,310 --> 00:48:43,570
That is to say somebody could come to
Google with a court order or a, or a,

806
00:48:44,530 --> 00:48:47,980
or a small nuke and say,
I want you to go in and change that entry.

807
00:48:49,180 --> 00:48:52,930
They can't do it in a way that can't
be seen, that can't fake an entry,

808
00:48:52,931 --> 00:48:54,040
even if they're being coerced.

809
00:48:54,730 --> 00:48:57,850
So the structure of the thing
protects them from coercion.

810
00:48:58,810 --> 00:49:01,600
And I think that was actually more
important in engineering decision then.

811
00:49:02,070 --> 00:49:03,700
Then Google is not trustworthy,
but that,

812
00:49:03,730 --> 00:49:05,790
but that makes them more trustworthy
because look, they say, you know,

813
00:49:05,800 --> 00:49:09,190
we can't even be coerced into changing
the century. So it's blockchain ish,

814
00:49:09,220 --> 00:49:13,170
but it's certainly not.
It's certainly not a zero trust blog team.

815
00:49:14,300 --> 00:49:14,730
Leeza.
