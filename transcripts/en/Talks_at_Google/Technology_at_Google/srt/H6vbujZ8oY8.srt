1
00:00:06,360 --> 00:00:09,030
Um, and I'm sure you guys
know why we're all here today.

2
00:00:09,170 --> 00:00:13,530
I'm bringing in my good buddy Michael
Block to talk about a game that he

3
00:00:13,531 --> 00:00:14,400
developed and titled,

4
00:00:14,401 --> 00:00:19,401
we asked Chicago which details the life
of a teenager growing up in a rough part

5
00:00:20,021 --> 00:00:23,370
Chicago and the different instances that
he goes through and decisions that he

6
00:00:23,371 --> 00:00:25,890
has to make in order to
protect himself and his family.

7
00:00:26,700 --> 00:00:29,820
But before we get into that, I'm
just going to go through, you know,

8
00:00:29,821 --> 00:00:33,190
a quick personal story about
myself. Um, and then after that,

9
00:00:33,191 --> 00:00:36,240
and Michael will go through some of the
creative process of going through the

10
00:00:36,241 --> 00:00:38,130
game.
Okay.

11
00:00:38,850 --> 00:00:43,140
So we live in a time we're witnessing
overwhelming amounts of violence is the

12
00:00:43,141 --> 00:00:43,974
norm.

13
00:00:44,340 --> 00:00:48,900
It seems like we can't look at our Twitter
feeds or Facebook timelines without

14
00:00:48,901 --> 00:00:49,950
viewing violent content.

15
00:00:51,180 --> 00:00:54,120
Not only does the world appear to
be becoming a more violent place,

16
00:00:54,420 --> 00:00:58,050
but it also seems as though we have video
evidence of nearly every violent event

17
00:00:59,490 --> 00:01:01,800
with so much negativity
and violence in the world.

18
00:01:02,910 --> 00:01:07,230
It's difficult to not fail
anger, sadness, or even fear.

19
00:01:08,760 --> 00:01:11,940
Gun violence in particular has been
a constant theme in a new circuit.

20
00:01:11,941 --> 00:01:12,774
As of late,

21
00:01:13,440 --> 00:01:18,440
everything from terrorist attacks to
police shootings to random murders,

22
00:01:19,710 --> 00:01:24,710
two school shootings appear to happen
way too frequently for most people.

23
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:27,750
These are just events that come and go,
but to some of us,

24
00:01:28,020 --> 00:01:30,870
they hit a little closer to home.
It really affect us on a personal level.

25
00:01:32,220 --> 00:01:35,280
For instance,
May 31st,

26
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:37,560
2015 was a day that
changed my life forever.

27
00:01:38,820 --> 00:01:42,870
I was coming from a wedding in
Cincinnati with my now fiance.

28
00:01:42,871 --> 00:01:45,030
When I got a call from a family member,

29
00:01:45,031 --> 00:01:48,030
it letting me know that my little
brother had just been shot and killed in

30
00:01:48,031 --> 00:01:52,950
Chicago. Um, it was a very
difficult situation, a process.

31
00:01:53,370 --> 00:01:57,450
Um, so many thoughts ran through my
head, you know, how did this happen?

32
00:01:58,200 --> 00:02:00,740
Why did this happen?
Um,

33
00:02:00,770 --> 00:02:04,080
I don't know what I would've done without
the love and support of friends and

34
00:02:04,081 --> 00:02:07,020
family members there in this
difficult time. You know,

35
00:02:07,021 --> 00:02:10,380
we were all there for each other in a
way that we weren't necessarily prepared

36
00:02:10,381 --> 00:02:15,300
to be, but that we had to
be. And obviously, you know,

37
00:02:15,301 --> 00:02:18,690
at first we went through
feelings of overwhelming sadness,

38
00:02:18,691 --> 00:02:22,200
but eventually we got to a point where
we could talk about my brother's life and

39
00:02:22,470 --> 00:02:25,680
remember all the good times and smile.

40
00:02:27,090 --> 00:02:29,610
Um,
so you know,

41
00:02:29,611 --> 00:02:32,100
different things are going to happen
in our lives that will affect us in a

42
00:02:32,101 --> 00:02:34,250
negative way, but it's
important to, you know,

43
00:02:34,430 --> 00:02:36,450
remain positive and keep pushing forward.

44
00:02:38,070 --> 00:02:41,760
So fast forward to May,

45
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:46,170
2016 a year after my brother passed and
a month or so after I started at Google,

46
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:50,580
I was speaking with my mother about
ways to honor my brother's life,

47
00:02:50,970 --> 00:02:55,970
when literally the next day I got a new
hire email from Google letting me know

48
00:02:56,101 --> 00:02:58,680
that I just received a
$10 donation voucher.

49
00:02:59,650 --> 00:03:01,720
The timing couldn't have
been any more perfect.

50
00:03:02,500 --> 00:03:07,500
Literally that same day I donated to the
Educational Fund to stop gun violence,

51
00:03:08,530 --> 00:03:12,100
which is a group that I've been pretty
active in ever since helping to raise

52
00:03:12,101 --> 00:03:14,200
both awareness and money for that group.

53
00:03:15,460 --> 00:03:18,780
But really that just led me to
realize how fortunate, you know,

54
00:03:18,850 --> 00:03:20,950
I am to work at such an amazing company,

55
00:03:21,260 --> 00:03:26,260
a company that really promotes diversity
and encourages us to volunteer and to

56
00:03:26,741 --> 00:03:28,480
donate to different organizations.

57
00:03:28,690 --> 00:03:33,190
And we'll even match our donations on our
behalf. You know, cause the most people,

58
00:03:33,270 --> 00:03:38,270
Google is a great place because we have
cool offices or great technology or free

59
00:03:38,321 --> 00:03:42,610
food. But really it's the people that
make the biggest difference, you know?

60
00:03:42,611 --> 00:03:44,530
And that goes for any company really,
you know,

61
00:03:44,531 --> 00:03:47,050
it's each and every one that you guys
would make the biggest difference there.

62
00:03:48,820 --> 00:03:50,800
So with that being said,

63
00:03:50,830 --> 00:03:54,400
I encourage each and every one of you
to be the positive force in the lives of

64
00:03:54,401 --> 00:03:57,820
those around you.
So say hi to someone new.

65
00:03:59,080 --> 00:04:00,910
Say how's it going to someone you know,

66
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:06,400
respond in a timely manner to
your friends, text messages,
you know, smile more,

67
00:04:06,940 --> 00:04:10,570
give more high fives and most importantly,
just be,

68
00:04:10,900 --> 00:04:15,850
just be a better person, you know?
And also I wanted to just recognize,

69
00:04:15,851 --> 00:04:19,060
you know, what a unique opportunity,
you know, Michael's game is.

70
00:04:19,480 --> 00:04:22,600
I feel like we all hear so much about
the violence that's going on throughout

71
00:04:22,601 --> 00:04:25,770
the world in Chicago
particularly. And you know, we,

72
00:04:25,771 --> 00:04:27,970
we hear that on the news
or different articles,

73
00:04:27,971 --> 00:04:32,500
but this is just a unique way to present
that to the public and sort of raise

74
00:04:32,501 --> 00:04:35,170
awareness about it.
So with that being said,

75
00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:39,040
I do want to kick it off to Michael
Block to talk about sort of the creative

76
00:04:39,041 --> 00:04:42,460
process and different things that were
involved in the creation of this game.

77
00:04:44,510 --> 00:04:48,870
[inaudible]

78
00:04:49,310 --> 00:04:52,430
thank you for that.
And stories like that.

79
00:04:52,690 --> 00:04:55,930
We're the reason that we started
working on this project. Um,

80
00:04:56,240 --> 00:05:00,530
I'm skipping around a little bit my
slides because this is a little a day of,

81
00:05:00,531 --> 00:05:02,540
we'd kind of changed the
order of this, but, um,

82
00:05:02,930 --> 00:05:07,280
we were doing volunteering and we heard
stories like Antonio's a over and over

83
00:05:07,281 --> 00:05:11,120
again from people on the south
side, uh, about their experiences.

84
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:12,390
And that was the,

85
00:05:12,391 --> 00:05:15,920
the huge motivating factor behind starting
this project and trying to talk about

86
00:05:15,921 --> 00:05:18,490
things in a more personal light, uh, and,

87
00:05:18,491 --> 00:05:22,730
and sharing the kind of personal stories
of people who have to deal with these

88
00:05:22,731 --> 00:05:25,280
situations and aren't
seeking out violence in arch,

89
00:05:25,340 --> 00:05:28,660
aren't trying to get involved in things
but get dragged into them anyway. Um,

90
00:05:28,670 --> 00:05:31,020
and so that's, that's kind
of the focus of the game. Uh,

91
00:05:31,090 --> 00:05:35,390
so I'm going to get back to my slides.
Um, so, hi everyone. I'm Michael.

92
00:05:36,410 --> 00:05:40,200
Uh, and I've been in game development
for about seven years. Uh,

93
00:05:40,220 --> 00:05:42,860
and I've been in Chicago for about 10,
so I'm not from Chicago.

94
00:05:42,861 --> 00:05:44,360
I'm from Wisconsin originally,

95
00:05:44,840 --> 00:05:48,290
but I've been here for a while and
I've always lived on the north side of

96
00:05:48,291 --> 00:05:49,124
Chicago.
Uh,

97
00:05:49,170 --> 00:05:54,170
and that gave me a particular experience
in a particular kind of worldview about

98
00:05:54,321 --> 00:05:56,480
the city. Um, and something that,

99
00:05:56,481 --> 00:06:01,481
this project kind of changed in my
mind about how I see the city now.

100
00:06:02,530 --> 00:06:07,070
Um, and I've been the project
lead on, on this game. So, uh,

101
00:06:07,370 --> 00:06:11,490
kind of, uh, a brief overview of,
of what the game is in general. A,

102
00:06:11,491 --> 00:06:14,390
so the entire game is driven through
kind of conversation choices.

103
00:06:14,391 --> 00:06:15,590
So you're able to make choices,

104
00:06:15,591 --> 00:06:17,780
think of it like a choose
your own adventure book, uh,

105
00:06:17,781 --> 00:06:20,430
where you're deciding how
to respond to things in,

106
00:06:20,431 --> 00:06:22,910
in conversation with
characters, and then, uh,

107
00:06:22,970 --> 00:06:27,770
they in turn change the story and kind
of respond to you in the appropriate way.

108
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:28,670
Um,

109
00:06:28,670 --> 00:06:31,940
so today I'm going to go through kind
of our process for developing that game,

110
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:34,880
uh, and some of the research
that we went through,

111
00:06:34,881 --> 00:06:39,230
the pre production and the design choices
that we had to make throughout the

112
00:06:39,231 --> 00:06:43,400
process that we're kind of unique to our
game. And then I'm going to talk about,

113
00:06:43,570 --> 00:06:48,110
uh, some of the lessons
learned. So we released the
game last week. Uh, it's been,

114
00:06:48,111 --> 00:06:52,040
it's been out for one week and so we
have some kind of preliminary information

115
00:06:52,041 --> 00:06:55,640
about how people are responding to the
game and things that have worked and

116
00:06:55,641 --> 00:06:58,550
things that maybe haven't
worked as well as we had hoped.

117
00:06:58,790 --> 00:07:03,170
And so I wanted to kind of share
that with you as well. Uh, so, uh,

118
00:07:03,410 --> 00:07:07,190
to begin with our development process.
So at the beginning,

119
00:07:07,191 --> 00:07:11,420
we are just generally talking about how
do we tell a true story and a game. Uh,

120
00:07:11,421 --> 00:07:16,010
typically with games, the player has
agency and they can make choices.

121
00:07:16,220 --> 00:07:19,850
And if you're making choices about
something that actually happened,

122
00:07:19,851 --> 00:07:22,880
that can potentially break
what actually happened.

123
00:07:23,060 --> 00:07:27,140
And so we were trying to wrap our minds
around how can we implement a true story

124
00:07:27,141 --> 00:07:31,550
in a game and, and maintain, uh, the
accuracy of the story without, uh,

125
00:07:31,730 --> 00:07:35,610
taking away all of the players'
choices. Um, and at the same time, uh,

126
00:07:35,690 --> 00:07:39,370
we were doing some volunteering
and this particular day, uh,

127
00:07:39,380 --> 00:07:43,580
it was community action day and basically
everybody who was involved fanned out

128
00:07:43,581 --> 00:07:46,710
across the city to various
public transit stops, uh, and,

129
00:07:46,711 --> 00:07:50,390
and other places in neighborhoods
on all sides of the city. Uh,

130
00:07:50,391 --> 00:07:54,980
and we basically interviewed people on
the street and ask them what they were

131
00:07:54,981 --> 00:07:56,870
experiencing in their neighborhoods,
what were the good things,

132
00:07:56,871 --> 00:07:59,420
what were the bad things?
And in this particular instance,

133
00:07:59,421 --> 00:08:02,810
it was how can this nonprofit kind
of help your neighborhood and provide

134
00:08:02,811 --> 00:08:03,740
opportunities for you?

135
00:08:04,550 --> 00:08:09,550
And what we heard a standing at the red
line stop on 63rd street was a lot of

136
00:08:12,440 --> 00:08:17,120
similar stories about, uh, sorry,
a lot of similar stories about,

137
00:08:17,210 --> 00:08:21,160
um, people getting mugs or people
getting held up at gunpoint. Uh,

138
00:08:21,170 --> 00:08:25,400
and they could point to, you know, this
street corner or that Ali, uh, and,

139
00:08:25,401 --> 00:08:27,880
and talk about their experiences
personally that they,

140
00:08:27,940 --> 00:08:31,130
they had experienced or things that
their friends had experienced. Uh,

141
00:08:31,131 --> 00:08:35,300
and we knew that these were
kind of commonalities among,
among all their stories,

142
00:08:35,301 --> 00:08:38,480
and they were, uh, something that
wasn't being talked about as much, uh,

143
00:08:38,481 --> 00:08:42,620
from this personal angle in
media and news and TV. Uh,

144
00:08:42,740 --> 00:08:44,900
and we thought this was a really,
um,

145
00:08:44,960 --> 00:08:48,310
important thing to be talking about and
something that would fit very well, uh,

146
00:08:48,350 --> 00:08:51,230
in the context of a game where you're
having to interact with things and you're

147
00:08:51,231 --> 00:08:55,960
having to make choices and understand a
character's intentions and reasoning, uh,

148
00:08:55,961 --> 00:09:00,240
as opposed to just watching something
play out or we're passing judgment on

149
00:09:00,241 --> 00:09:04,080
somebody because they made a choice. Um,
you have to actually make the choice.

150
00:09:05,160 --> 00:09:07,200
So we were talking to our
volunteers, uh, that were,

151
00:09:07,201 --> 00:09:10,980
that were with us at the 63rd street stop
and they were super excited about the

152
00:09:10,981 --> 00:09:13,650
game and they were from the south side
and they were like, we want to help,

153
00:09:13,651 --> 00:09:14,620
how can we help?
Uh,

154
00:09:14,710 --> 00:09:18,120
and so we followed up with them and
did one on one interviews with them and

155
00:09:18,121 --> 00:09:20,400
really went in depth about
their experiences growing up,

156
00:09:20,430 --> 00:09:24,450
talk to them a lot about the specific
situations that were very kind of

157
00:09:24,451 --> 00:09:25,830
influential in their lives.

158
00:09:26,130 --> 00:09:30,330
And then we kind of got referrals
to their friends and their friends,

159
00:09:30,331 --> 00:09:33,020
their friends. And so we got
this kind of expanded network of,

160
00:09:33,021 --> 00:09:36,990
of one on one interviews that
went much more in depth. Uh,

161
00:09:37,860 --> 00:09:41,220
and then, uh, we started
looking for a writer. Uh,

162
00:09:41,280 --> 00:09:43,900
so during this process we were
kind of reaching out to people to,

163
00:09:43,980 --> 00:09:47,550
to see if we could find a writer who
was from the south side and could,

164
00:09:47,580 --> 00:09:52,050
could really bring their
personal experiences and
their understanding of growing

165
00:09:52,051 --> 00:09:55,780
up in these neighborhoods
to the game itself. So, uh,

166
00:09:56,880 --> 00:10:00,000
we took those interviews,
uh, and we were, you know,

167
00:10:00,030 --> 00:10:04,050
working on these on our own and trying
to kind of find the commonalities in them

168
00:10:04,051 --> 00:10:06,180
and, and really figure out what
the game was going to talk about.

169
00:10:06,540 --> 00:10:11,480
And we were doing outreach to
colleges and I found, uh, Tony, uh,

170
00:10:11,550 --> 00:10:14,460
through Kennedy King College,
which is in Englewood, uh,

171
00:10:14,461 --> 00:10:17,010
by just reaching out to English
professors and saying, Hey,

172
00:10:17,011 --> 00:10:20,070
we've got a game and we need somebody to
work on it. Would anybody be interested?

173
00:10:20,071 --> 00:10:24,630
And we got in touch with Tony and he grew
up in Englewood and he raised a family

174
00:10:24,631 --> 00:10:25,630
and Englewood.
Uh,

175
00:10:25,640 --> 00:10:28,980
and he had kind of all of the perspectives
that we were talking about in the

176
00:10:28,981 --> 00:10:32,640
game. So you're playing as a teenager, but
you have parents and your parents have,

177
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:35,640
you know, a lot of concerns
of their own, about, you know,

178
00:10:35,641 --> 00:10:38,490
what choices you're making and the
things that you're doing in your life.

179
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:40,410
And so he kind of had the perspective of,

180
00:10:40,411 --> 00:10:43,710
of growing up in this and also
raising a family in this. So, uh,

181
00:10:43,711 --> 00:10:47,850
he was able to kind of present all of
the perspectives that we were looking for

182
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:52,510
a in the game. The caveat was, uh,

183
00:10:52,530 --> 00:10:57,480
that he wanted to do film and he wasn't
particularly familiar with games.

184
00:10:57,870 --> 00:11:02,070
Uh, and so we were like, okay, we can make
this work, this is going to be fine. Uh,

185
00:11:02,071 --> 00:11:06,390
but there was a lot more kind of learning
process than we originally expected,

186
00:11:06,710 --> 00:11:07,260
um,

187
00:11:07,260 --> 00:11:11,560
from transitioning from kind of a linear
storytelling to branching dialogue and,

188
00:11:11,561 --> 00:11:14,700
and multiple choice options
and things like that. So, uh,

189
00:11:14,940 --> 00:11:18,930
a lot of the early production,
you get to see some real early shots here.

190
00:11:19,830 --> 00:11:23,130
The early production was a lot
of iteration with Tony, uh,

191
00:11:23,131 --> 00:11:27,210
to kind of hone in on what choices
were interesting in what choices were

192
00:11:27,211 --> 00:11:29,850
compelling and what things you
could give to the player that,

193
00:11:29,851 --> 00:11:33,030
that kept them interested in the
story and kept them engaged. Uh,

194
00:11:33,031 --> 00:11:36,770
and that iteration a, it took a little
bit longer than we thought, but it was,

195
00:11:36,810 --> 00:11:39,720
it was worth it, uh, to make sure that
the things that we were representing,

196
00:11:39,721 --> 00:11:43,380
word being done well and being accurate
to the, the stories that we had heard.

197
00:11:44,340 --> 00:11:48,840
Uh, it also resulted in us coming to some
realizations that we wouldn't have had,

198
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:51,990
uh, had Tony not come
onto the project. Um,

199
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:56,410
and is a scene from the
game. Uh, so to set this up,

200
00:11:56,411 --> 00:12:01,150
your sitting down at a table with your
family and one of your friends from

201
00:12:01,151 --> 00:12:05,620
school and a gunshot is going to go off
outside and they're going to react in a

202
00:12:05,621 --> 00:12:07,870
certain way. Uh, so I'll talk
about it more after that.

203
00:12:08,770 --> 00:12:11,640
Janice is ready.
Come sit down and let's bless the food.

204
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:19,393
Bow Your heads.

205
00:12:23,020 --> 00:12:23,853
Dear Lord,

206
00:12:24,010 --> 00:12:28,570
we thank you for the meal we are about
to receive and we thank you for life,

207
00:12:28,810 --> 00:12:31,360
family and friends.
Amen.

208
00:12:33,460 --> 00:12:37,990
Was that a gunshot? Everyone stay
seated and don't go near the windows.

209
00:12:40,200 --> 00:12:42,480
I'm so tired of all these shootings.

210
00:12:42,780 --> 00:12:45,270
It's like we're prisoners
in our own houses,

211
00:12:48,890 --> 00:12:50,420
lots of base. Uh, so,

212
00:12:50,990 --> 00:12:54,690
so when we were originally
approaching this, uh,

213
00:12:54,710 --> 00:12:56,910
we wanted to talk about
gunshots, obviously, uh,

214
00:12:56,930 --> 00:12:59,600
that was kind of the focus of the scene.
Um,

215
00:12:59,630 --> 00:13:04,070
but our original thought about how this
was going to go was that there was a

216
00:13:04,071 --> 00:13:08,480
gunshot going off outside and people were
going to be afraid of it or they were

217
00:13:08,481 --> 00:13:10,790
going to get upset. Um,
and, and talk about it.

218
00:13:10,791 --> 00:13:14,440
And when we were talking to Tony about
how this scene was going to play out,

219
00:13:14,460 --> 00:13:18,740
he was like, well, that wouldn't happen.
People in these neighborhoods are, are,

220
00:13:18,860 --> 00:13:20,420
have grown accustomed to this,

221
00:13:20,450 --> 00:13:23,180
to the point where if the gunshot
sounds far enough away from your house,

222
00:13:23,540 --> 00:13:28,110
you're not going to have a reaction in,
in this. Like, you know, explicit way. Uh,

223
00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:29,750
you'll recognize that it happened,

224
00:13:29,751 --> 00:13:32,390
but you're not going to necessarily
bring it up and change what you're doing

225
00:13:32,391 --> 00:13:34,730
because of it.
If it seems like it's far enough away.

226
00:13:35,690 --> 00:13:40,250
And so that presented a problem
for us because, uh, making a game,

227
00:13:40,550 --> 00:13:41,840
uh,
you,

228
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:46,400
you can get into a situation where the
player doesn't realize that something is

229
00:13:46,401 --> 00:13:49,340
supposed to play out in a certain way.
So if the characters didn't react at all,

230
00:13:49,580 --> 00:13:52,700
everyone would basically just assume
that we messed up and we made the game

231
00:13:52,701 --> 00:13:55,820
wrong or there's a bug or something
happened and for some reason no one

232
00:13:55,821 --> 00:14:00,080
responded. And that would
be really strange. So we had
to come up with a solution,

233
00:14:00,081 --> 00:14:04,490
that kind of message to the player
what was supposed to be, um, you know,

234
00:14:04,580 --> 00:14:08,240
a normal event was actually normal to
these characters even though the player

235
00:14:08,241 --> 00:14:11,120
was likely not to think that
it was a normal event. Uh,

236
00:14:11,121 --> 00:14:13,850
so we did a lot of iteration with him
and the solution that we kind of came to

237
00:14:13,851 --> 00:14:17,660
was having Taylor bring up the
issue as a kind of frustration.

238
00:14:17,690 --> 00:14:19,280
She wasn't afraid of it.

239
00:14:19,400 --> 00:14:22,310
She was just frustrated that it's still
happening and that it continues to

240
00:14:22,311 --> 00:14:22,671
happen.

241
00:14:22,671 --> 00:14:25,430
And that allowed us to kind of get
into this discussion and have the wider

242
00:14:25,431 --> 00:14:27,110
discussion without,
uh,

243
00:14:27,140 --> 00:14:31,680
making the characters do something that
was out of character or, or seeming, uh,

244
00:14:31,850 --> 00:14:35,060
to not represent those characters the
way that they would react in the real

245
00:14:35,061 --> 00:14:36,170
world.
Um,

246
00:14:36,171 --> 00:14:40,250
so those sorts of realizations we wouldn't
have come to had Tony not been on the

247
00:14:40,251 --> 00:14:41,330
team.
And I think it was,

248
00:14:41,570 --> 00:14:44,630
it was super important that we got
someone from the neighborhoods who work on

249
00:14:44,631 --> 00:14:47,900
the writing for the games for this reason,
so that they could point out to these,

250
00:14:47,960 --> 00:14:51,860
these important things that we needed to
talk about and that could kind of pass

251
00:14:51,861 --> 00:14:55,570
on this realization and this
found knowledge to the player, um,

252
00:14:55,710 --> 00:15:00,470
and figure out ways to message
that instead of just kind
of skipping over it. Um,

253
00:15:01,370 --> 00:15:05,810
so this comes down to knowing
what's ask, right? Um, and it's,

254
00:15:05,811 --> 00:15:09,680
it's all about our assumptions.
And we did interviews,

255
00:15:09,681 --> 00:15:13,640
we did lots of in depth things to
find out what was happening in these

256
00:15:13,641 --> 00:15:16,490
situations. But in a lot of,
a lot of those interviews,

257
00:15:16,700 --> 00:15:20,210
the questions that we were asking were
based on kind of our assumptions that we

258
00:15:20,211 --> 00:15:24,410
had made previously. And so that got us
to certain questions but not to others.

259
00:15:24,440 --> 00:15:25,940
And that I think,
uh,

260
00:15:26,030 --> 00:15:30,980
is one of the many reasons why having
a diverse team creating products is a

261
00:15:30,981 --> 00:15:34,760
super important. Right. Um, yeah.

262
00:15:35,690 --> 00:15:38,780
So another thing that
kind of came out of this,

263
00:15:38,781 --> 00:15:42,710
this close iteration with Tony and also
with an artist that we brought on who's

264
00:15:42,711 --> 00:15:43,910
from the south side as well,

265
00:15:44,180 --> 00:15:49,180
a is a subtler things that we were able
to place in the environment that have a

266
00:15:49,881 --> 00:15:54,590
huge impact on the kind of psychological
effects of playing the game.

267
00:15:54,850 --> 00:15:55,070
Uh,

268
00:15:55,070 --> 00:15:58,730
and things that people had talked about
when we were interviewing them and doing

269
00:15:58,731 --> 00:15:59,970
one on one interviews,
uh,

270
00:16:00,180 --> 00:16:03,770
that were psychologically impactful
on their lives growing up in these

271
00:16:03,771 --> 00:16:06,530
neighborhoods. Um, so in this scene, uh,

272
00:16:06,531 --> 00:16:09,580
there's this red x on this house,
uh,

273
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:12,000
and for one the house is
boarded up as well. Uh,

274
00:16:12,020 --> 00:16:16,880
but there's also this red x on the house.
And if you've seen that before, uh,

275
00:16:16,910 --> 00:16:17,743
or if you haven't,

276
00:16:17,810 --> 00:16:22,810
the red x is a sign that says this
building is marked for demolition and it

277
00:16:22,851 --> 00:16:25,490
means that this will be demolished,
but it hasn't been yet.

278
00:16:25,610 --> 00:16:28,930
So essentially the
building is condemned and,

279
00:16:28,931 --> 00:16:32,810
and ready to be demolished and it's just
sitting there being an eyesore. Right.

280
00:16:33,140 --> 00:16:33,500
Um,

281
00:16:33,500 --> 00:16:38,500
and the psychological impact as we
were talking to Tony and other people,

282
00:16:38,780 --> 00:16:43,760
uh, of walking through your neighborhood
and seeing a building like this on every

283
00:16:43,761 --> 00:16:48,170
block and seeing vacant lots
on every block, um, has a,

284
00:16:48,200 --> 00:16:51,310
has a psychological impact growing
up in those neighborhoods. And, and,

285
00:16:51,311 --> 00:16:53,420
and having to walk past
those things all the time.

286
00:16:53,421 --> 00:16:56,840
And we wanted to kind of pass that along
to the player to give them a sense of,

287
00:16:57,230 --> 00:17:01,910
of what are the impacts that people have
growing up in these neighborhoods. Um,

288
00:17:01,940 --> 00:17:06,110
so that was one of the things that we
included. And then this other one is, uh,

289
00:17:06,380 --> 00:17:10,970
an another example is this a
bulletproof glass in a restaurant.

290
00:17:10,971 --> 00:17:15,830
So you go to work in a restaurant, which
is kind of like a fast food type place.

291
00:17:16,050 --> 00:17:16,580
Um,

292
00:17:16,580 --> 00:17:21,580
and it has bulletproof glass
and an exchange window so
that you can get the food

293
00:17:22,701 --> 00:17:26,420
to the customer, uh, without having
to go outside the bulletproof glass.

294
00:17:26,960 --> 00:17:31,230
And this, we don't explicitly talk about
this. We don't explicitly talk about the,

295
00:17:31,231 --> 00:17:35,640
the red x sign, um, beside a
couple like passing comments in,

296
00:17:35,641 --> 00:17:36,860
in some side dialog.

297
00:17:37,070 --> 00:17:41,150
And the point was more to just have
these things exist in the world and have

298
00:17:41,151 --> 00:17:46,010
people be confronted with them and have
to think about them. Right? Uh, and,

299
00:17:46,011 --> 00:17:49,070
and this sort of thing is
something that is totally,

300
00:17:49,350 --> 00:17:53,610
so it would be very strange
for the characters to come
out and talk about it. Um,

301
00:17:53,730 --> 00:17:56,820
but it's something that if you're
playing the game and this is not your

302
00:17:56,821 --> 00:18:01,560
experience, it's a very odd
thing to have in a restaurants.

303
00:18:01,830 --> 00:18:06,000
Uh, and so it naturally starts to
raise questions about why it's there.

304
00:18:08,610 --> 00:18:11,940
So another really early shot,

305
00:18:11,970 --> 00:18:16,730
I don't know if these are even visible
as, as really early shots, but yeah. Uh,

306
00:18:16,740 --> 00:18:19,380
so in the beginning, uh,
the art was very, very,

307
00:18:19,381 --> 00:18:21,090
very scaled back to be really rough.

308
00:18:21,091 --> 00:18:24,660
We were trying to get this
game done in a year. Uh,

309
00:18:24,690 --> 00:18:29,220
and we intentionally said like, okay,
we want it to be realistic generally,

310
00:18:29,221 --> 00:18:31,250
but we're going to be very,
very rough with the,

311
00:18:31,270 --> 00:18:35,730
the visuals because we were a small team
and we don't have as much money to fund

312
00:18:35,731 --> 00:18:39,180
a bigger project. And as
this screenshot shows, uh,

313
00:18:39,660 --> 00:18:43,490
when you try to do that with
realistic human characters, uh,

314
00:18:43,500 --> 00:18:47,820
it looks really strange and people get
really weirded out by your characters. Uh,

315
00:18:47,821 --> 00:18:50,040
we had a lot of play tests early
on where we were like, hey,

316
00:18:50,250 --> 00:18:53,010
we just want to know if the story is
good. Like, just tell us about the story.

317
00:18:53,010 --> 00:18:54,870
We know the characters aren't ready yet.
We are not,

318
00:18:54,900 --> 00:18:57,180
we know that they have work to be done.
People would just be like,

319
00:18:57,181 --> 00:18:59,790
I can't the characters, I
just, I don't know what to,

320
00:18:59,860 --> 00:19:04,110
I can't do anything with this. I like
just the store. Okay. Whatever. Uh,

321
00:19:04,111 --> 00:19:07,710
so a lot of those design choices that
we made early on about being very

322
00:19:07,711 --> 00:19:09,360
realistic, um, they were intentional.

323
00:19:09,361 --> 00:19:13,800
We wanted them to be realistic because
we wanted the player to have as few

324
00:19:13,801 --> 00:19:15,330
excuses for

325
00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:20,220
disregarding what was happening in
the game as possible. So if they,

326
00:19:20,221 --> 00:19:23,220
if they saw a cartoony visual
style, they might go, oh,

327
00:19:23,221 --> 00:19:26,160
well this is an approximation and
that's not what everybody experiences or

328
00:19:26,161 --> 00:19:28,520
that's not a thing that's,
that's realistic. Um,

329
00:19:28,530 --> 00:19:31,160
and we wanted people to
have as few of those, um,

330
00:19:31,230 --> 00:19:34,620
kind of reasons to be skeptical
about the content of the game.

331
00:19:34,620 --> 00:19:36,510
So we made these choices intentionally,

332
00:19:36,511 --> 00:19:40,800
but they got us into this
kind of iterative improvement
loop where we needed to

333
00:19:40,801 --> 00:19:44,700
keep improving the visual so
that people started to, uh,

334
00:19:44,790 --> 00:19:48,840
relate to the characters and not be
like turned off by, by the depiction.

335
00:19:49,230 --> 00:19:50,063
Um,

336
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:54,750
so the project's balloon to a four year
project from the original one year,

337
00:19:55,020 --> 00:19:58,500
uh, hope, uh, to get the
game done in a year. Um,

338
00:19:58,530 --> 00:20:01,110
and that caused a lot of extra work,
but I think it was,

339
00:20:01,140 --> 00:20:02,950
it was worth it in the end.
Uh,

340
00:20:03,080 --> 00:20:05,880
so we took the game to a number of
conventions and this was where we were

341
00:20:05,881 --> 00:20:07,440
getting a lot of our feedback.

342
00:20:07,830 --> 00:20:11,480
And the first one that we went to
was a convention in Indianapolis. Uh,

343
00:20:11,620 --> 00:20:13,980
and the first group of
kids at the booth was from,

344
00:20:14,010 --> 00:20:18,270
we're from the south side of Chicago.
Uh, and so this is kind of our, our,

345
00:20:18,540 --> 00:20:21,220
um, trial by fire here, right? We,

346
00:20:21,221 --> 00:20:24,420
we hadn't demoed it publicly before and
here was a group from the south side who

347
00:20:24,421 --> 00:20:27,810
would be able to speak to you whether
it was accurate and representative and

348
00:20:27,811 --> 00:20:29,840
fitting with their experience.
Um,

349
00:20:29,880 --> 00:20:33,540
and the kids immediately got excited
and they started talking about how the

350
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:37,530
house looks like their house and their
friends and everybody that they knew.

351
00:20:37,590 --> 00:20:41,850
And they were really, really,
really, really excited about it. Um,

352
00:20:41,880 --> 00:20:45,750
and that was super validating
and rewarding and we got
a lot of good feedback

353
00:20:45,751 --> 00:20:50,540
from them. Uh, in subsequent shows, uh,

354
00:20:50,580 --> 00:20:54,520
we started demoing it in Vr, uh,
because we had this, you know,

355
00:20:54,521 --> 00:20:59,260
people keep talking about Vr as
an empathy building, a device,

356
00:20:59,290 --> 00:21:02,860
I guess, inexperience,
uh, enhancement. Uh,

357
00:21:02,861 --> 00:21:06,820
and so we were like, okay, let's try it.
Let's see if this is actually effective,

358
00:21:06,821 --> 00:21:11,530
if it does actually lead
to more engagement and more
interest in the subject

359
00:21:11,531 --> 00:21:15,580
matter. Um, and uh, we had
an interesting experience.

360
00:21:16,150 --> 00:21:20,200
Uh, the kids that I'm going to be talking
about are not the kids pictured. Um,

361
00:21:20,590 --> 00:21:25,120
they approached the booth and started
making some very insensitive and racist

362
00:21:25,121 --> 00:21:28,780
jokes about the characters. Um, there
were other people playing on the,

363
00:21:28,810 --> 00:21:33,810
on the TVS at the time and they didn't
really have any interest in the game,

364
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:37,060
but they saw the Oculus at the end of
the table after they've made their jokes

365
00:21:37,300 --> 00:21:41,050
and then went, oh, when Oculus, I want
to play an oculus. So I was like, okay,

366
00:21:41,140 --> 00:21:44,500
well sure, we'll sit you down and play
the Oculus. There wasn't anybody playing.

367
00:21:44,501 --> 00:21:49,501
So they played for about five minutes
each kid and they subbed out and after the

368
00:21:50,051 --> 00:21:51,670
first kid played for five minutes,

369
00:21:51,910 --> 00:21:55,240
he got up and started talking about
the characters as if they were people.

370
00:21:55,300 --> 00:21:58,240
And he started talking about them in
very nuanced ways and talking about the

371
00:21:58,241 --> 00:22:00,580
problems that they were having.
And he was,

372
00:22:00,730 --> 00:22:05,050
he basically pulled a full one 80
in the course of about five minutes.

373
00:22:05,380 --> 00:22:09,490
Um, and there's so many things
that are specific to the situation.

374
00:22:09,491 --> 00:22:12,250
It's at a conference.
He standing next to the developer.

375
00:22:12,370 --> 00:22:14,980
There's lots of reasons
why that could happen,

376
00:22:14,981 --> 00:22:17,800
but it didn't necessarily feel
like it was all, you know,

377
00:22:17,830 --> 00:22:20,050
you're standing next to a developer
and don't want to say something bad.

378
00:22:20,200 --> 00:22:23,880
It felt like a lot of it did actually
come out of a better understanding and in

379
00:22:23,890 --> 00:22:27,130
an engagement with, with
the subject. So, um,

380
00:22:27,310 --> 00:22:30,880
that gave us a little bit of hope
that the game was actually going to be

381
00:22:30,881 --> 00:22:34,030
effective at what was originally
kind of our, our hope of,

382
00:22:34,031 --> 00:22:37,950
of changing people's minds about people
living in these neighborhoods and,

383
00:22:37,951 --> 00:22:42,010
and trying to increase empathy
and educate people. Um, and it,

384
00:22:42,011 --> 00:22:45,190
it gave us hope, uh, you know, it's
again, a conference setting and,

385
00:22:45,191 --> 00:22:49,150
and that sort of thing. So, uh,
now that we've released, uh,

386
00:22:49,870 --> 00:22:54,500
what have we learned? So the
game came out last week, uh,

387
00:22:54,580 --> 00:22:58,030
and we're gonna be doing other things, but
here's some, some preliminary findings.

388
00:22:59,440 --> 00:23:03,000
So our goals primarily,
uh,

389
00:23:03,160 --> 00:23:07,480
we wanted to create a respectful and
realistic depiction of a particular story

390
00:23:07,481 --> 00:23:10,090
of growing up on the south
side of Chicago. Um, and again,

391
00:23:10,091 --> 00:23:13,540
another thing that Kinda came out
of our development process was this

392
00:23:13,541 --> 00:23:18,340
understanding of trying to break down the
idea of monolithic representation, uh,

393
00:23:18,341 --> 00:23:18,611
and,

394
00:23:18,611 --> 00:23:22,900
and really trying to present all these
different possible ways that people have

395
00:23:22,901 --> 00:23:23,631
responded and,

396
00:23:23,631 --> 00:23:27,730
and did respond when we were talking to
them in interviews to various situations.

397
00:23:27,940 --> 00:23:30,640
So not everybody responds to a
gunshot going off in the same way,

398
00:23:30,641 --> 00:23:33,250
and not everybody responds to
getting held up the same way.

399
00:23:33,251 --> 00:23:37,000
So we wanted to depict that
too, to add to the, um,

400
00:23:37,780 --> 00:23:41,200
discussion about monolithic
representation. Uh,

401
00:23:42,100 --> 00:23:42,940
in addition,

402
00:23:43,570 --> 00:23:47,870
the point of the game is to start in the
players and to get them talking about

403
00:23:47,871 --> 00:23:50,960
the things that are happening in the game
and, and their impact on those things.

404
00:23:51,680 --> 00:23:52,513
Uh,

405
00:23:52,820 --> 00:23:57,820
we had these long term hopes that those
discussions would lead to people having

406
00:23:59,090 --> 00:24:02,240
these thoughts when they're voting and
when they're thinking about politics and

407
00:24:02,241 --> 00:24:04,330
when they're thinking about, you know, uh,

408
00:24:04,610 --> 00:24:07,840
supporting nonprofit works
or things like that. Um,

409
00:24:07,860 --> 00:24:09,410
and this stuff is super hard to measure.

410
00:24:09,411 --> 00:24:13,490
So we knew that was going to be kind
of a long shot, but it was a goal. Uh,

411
00:24:13,640 --> 00:24:16,750
we were obviously hopeful that it
was self sustaining enough. Uh,

412
00:24:16,970 --> 00:24:19,520
from the beginning we knew that this was
not something that was likely to make a

413
00:24:19,521 --> 00:24:23,510
lot of money. Uh, and we were kind of
hoping for breakeven. That was our,

414
00:24:23,540 --> 00:24:28,070
that was our expectation was breakeven
was a, was a, a best case scenario.

415
00:24:28,580 --> 00:24:32,870
Um, and for me, I think, uh,

416
00:24:32,960 --> 00:24:33,800
one thing that I was,

417
00:24:33,830 --> 00:24:38,830
I was really excited about it was kind
of inspiring other developers to approach

418
00:24:39,141 --> 00:24:44,141
these subjects and to hire more diverse
teams and to encourage that sort of a

419
00:24:44,270 --> 00:24:48,860
change in the industry. Because I
can make a game and that's great. Uh,

420
00:24:48,861 --> 00:24:49,940
and it can have an impact.

421
00:24:49,941 --> 00:24:52,610
But if I can encourage other
people to do this as well,

422
00:24:52,611 --> 00:24:56,120
then that should have a bigger
impact than I could have by myself.

423
00:24:56,121 --> 00:24:59,870
So to me that was, that was a pretty
big, uh, goal from the beginning.

424
00:25:00,620 --> 00:25:04,760
So, uh, the game's been out for a week.

425
00:25:05,060 --> 00:25:09,560
Early results are that the people that
actually played the game because there

426
00:25:09,561 --> 00:25:12,230
are lots of people that would be happy
to tell you what they think about the

427
00:25:12,231 --> 00:25:14,960
game, but have not
played the game. Uh, the,

428
00:25:14,990 --> 00:25:17,690
the majority of people who played the
game and actually know what they're

429
00:25:17,691 --> 00:25:21,850
talking about, uh, in relationship
to the south side of Chicago. Um,

430
00:25:21,890 --> 00:25:25,640
think that we did a good job of
representing a life on the south side.

431
00:25:26,840 --> 00:25:30,890
And we've gotten lots of emails and
comments and blog posts and tweets and

432
00:25:30,891 --> 00:25:33,830
reviews from people who are from the
south side who talked about how it

433
00:25:33,831 --> 00:25:38,030
represented their experience
and, uh, some critiques for sure,

434
00:25:38,031 --> 00:25:42,590
but also a lot of, uh, a lot of
positivity about the representation.

435
00:25:42,830 --> 00:25:45,560
And like almost across the board,

436
00:25:45,561 --> 00:25:48,850
everyone was saying this is something
that needed to be done and it's a,

437
00:25:48,851 --> 00:25:53,620
it's a kind of stepping stone towards
better things that will come later. Um,

438
00:25:53,710 --> 00:25:58,670
so that was very positive and reassuring.
We've also got lots of other stuff,

439
00:25:58,690 --> 00:26:01,640
uh, that was, uh, very, um,

440
00:26:02,270 --> 00:26:04,190
highly offensive and racist,
uh,

441
00:26:04,250 --> 00:26:07,700
posted to our forums and in
comments on all sorts of things. Uh,

442
00:26:07,701 --> 00:26:10,940
and the scale of it was a little
bit more than we were expecting. Uh,

443
00:26:10,941 --> 00:26:14,030
but we kind of knew from the beginning
we were gonna be getting some of that.

444
00:26:14,070 --> 00:26:16,070
I was just kind of hoping that
it would be a little less than,

445
00:26:16,490 --> 00:26:20,300
than what we ended up
getting. Um, but yeah,

446
00:26:20,360 --> 00:26:23,870
so for starting conversations,
uh, before we launched,

447
00:26:24,170 --> 00:26:27,350
another thing that happened at some of
the conventions that we went to, uh,

448
00:26:27,351 --> 00:26:31,670
we would be walking around, uh, not
at our booth, not near our booth.

449
00:26:31,970 --> 00:26:34,880
And we would hear people talking about
the game and talking about the characters

450
00:26:34,881 --> 00:26:38,360
and talking about what would it be
like if this was our experience, if,

451
00:26:38,380 --> 00:26:42,210
if we had grown up in this situation.
Um,

452
00:26:42,310 --> 00:26:45,620
and I think in particular
the gaming audience, uh,

453
00:26:45,810 --> 00:26:48,530
who oftentimes,
uh,

454
00:26:48,630 --> 00:26:52,830
we'll start giant campaigns about how
we have to get politics out of games and

455
00:26:52,831 --> 00:26:56,390
we have to stop being so political
and all of this other stuff. Uh, to,

456
00:26:56,400 --> 00:27:00,210
to know that these conversations were
happening at a gaming convention I think

457
00:27:00,211 --> 00:27:04,770
was really a great thing to have happen.
And I think it was important.

458
00:27:04,771 --> 00:27:06,840
And I think the,
uh,

459
00:27:07,710 --> 00:27:11,250
the hopeful shift that we're going to
get is that as more people are having

460
00:27:11,251 --> 00:27:12,930
these serious discussions in games,

461
00:27:13,140 --> 00:27:15,990
that it becomes more normal to be talking
about this stuff and to be talking

462
00:27:15,991 --> 00:27:19,830
about the real issues that are happening
in the games industry around race and

463
00:27:19,831 --> 00:27:24,000
representation. Uh, and if we
can be a part of starting that,

464
00:27:24,001 --> 00:27:26,700
I think that's a good thing.
Um,

465
00:27:28,260 --> 00:27:30,930
from the beginning until now,

466
00:27:30,960 --> 00:27:33,420
we've had over 75 articles and interviews,

467
00:27:33,421 --> 00:27:37,700
unique articles and interviews across
all these different types of medium, um,

468
00:27:38,010 --> 00:27:41,170
way more than I ever
expected when we started. Uh,

469
00:27:41,240 --> 00:27:44,700
and I think probably looking at our sales,

470
00:27:44,820 --> 00:27:48,780
these will most likely have a bigger
impact on starting conversations than the

471
00:27:48,781 --> 00:27:49,650
actual game.
Well,

472
00:27:49,860 --> 00:27:52,230
because of the number of people that
are going to be playing the game versus

473
00:27:52,231 --> 00:27:55,470
seeing a kind of media coverage of it.
Um,

474
00:27:55,500 --> 00:27:58,620
although there's lots of youtube videos
that are getting views of like the full

475
00:27:58,621 --> 00:27:59,454
game being played.

476
00:27:59,580 --> 00:28:03,420
So it's entirely possible that people
will get some out of that as well. Uh,

477
00:28:03,421 --> 00:28:04,440
but yeah,
I think,

478
00:28:04,441 --> 00:28:08,370
I think this is probably the biggest
place that we have been able to actually

479
00:28:08,371 --> 00:28:13,250
start conversations and we've been
doing it at consumer shows and,

480
00:28:13,251 --> 00:28:14,910
and trade events and,
and that sort of thing.

481
00:28:14,911 --> 00:28:18,630
So getting some conversations
out of that. So for this, uh,

482
00:28:19,290 --> 00:28:22,830
I don't know that we can claim anything
specific really. We're only a week out.

483
00:28:23,100 --> 00:28:26,970
Um, hopefully we've had an impact through
the conversations that we started.

484
00:28:26,971 --> 00:28:31,860
And we're also, uh, working with
a professor at Northwestern now,

485
00:28:32,070 --> 00:28:36,270
uh, to do psych studies on the game and
talk about the efficacy of the game to

486
00:28:36,271 --> 00:28:38,040
educate people and to increase empathy.

487
00:28:38,450 --> 00:28:42,150
And those things I think are ways that
we can find out if we actually have the

488
00:28:42,151 --> 00:28:46,400
impact that we're hoping to have. And
if we can find out that, uh, you know,

489
00:28:46,410 --> 00:28:50,400
people are walking away from this
with an understanding that then is

490
00:28:50,401 --> 00:28:53,730
transformative to their actions
later. Uh, that's, that's the hope.

491
00:28:56,280 --> 00:29:00,990
So, uh, financially, uh, I
don't think we're there yet.

492
00:29:02,010 --> 00:29:06,210
We definitely haven't recouped the
investment that we've put into it. Um,

493
00:29:06,270 --> 00:29:09,090
and again, that was kind
of a long shot anyway. Uh,

494
00:29:09,091 --> 00:29:12,180
but I think there are two big reasons why,
um,

495
00:29:12,240 --> 00:29:17,100
and it was important design
decisions that we made very early on,

496
00:29:17,400 --> 00:29:17,701
uh,

497
00:29:17,701 --> 00:29:22,701
that were important to us to tell
the story that we want it to tell a.

498
00:29:23,250 --> 00:29:26,730
So the first one is this narrative
pacing, um, is, as I said,

499
00:29:26,910 --> 00:29:31,470
realistic on the slide. You can read
that as slow. Uh, and generally speaking,

500
00:29:31,560 --> 00:29:35,850
gamers are looking for fast things.
They're looking for more stuff on screen,

501
00:29:36,060 --> 00:29:39,060
more particle effects,
more exciting, you know,

502
00:29:39,061 --> 00:29:42,130
sound effects and everything
going crazy all the time. Uh,

503
00:29:42,131 --> 00:29:46,280
and that wasn't the story that we
wanted to tell and it wasn't, uh,

504
00:29:46,690 --> 00:29:50,200
going to be doing the people that we
interviewed any justice by telling the

505
00:29:50,201 --> 00:29:51,820
story in that way.
Um,

506
00:29:51,850 --> 00:29:54,250
and so we made a conscious choice
at the beginning to not do this,

507
00:29:54,251 --> 00:29:58,300
but it kind of put us at odds with
our primary demographic that we were

508
00:29:58,301 --> 00:30:01,900
advertising in the game too. Um, and
so I think that definitely contributed.

509
00:30:03,430 --> 00:30:08,170
The other big thing, uh, was we take
away control from the player a lot.

510
00:30:08,590 --> 00:30:11,530
Uh, and this was intentional
and it became, uh,

511
00:30:12,200 --> 00:30:16,240
a little bit more. Um, we,

512
00:30:16,470 --> 00:30:18,960
we did it a lot more as
the project went on, uh,

513
00:30:18,970 --> 00:30:22,260
in particular because of
a game called spent. Uh,

514
00:30:22,270 --> 00:30:23,650
so if any of you've heard of the game,

515
00:30:23,830 --> 00:30:28,830
basically it's a web game wherein you're
given a certain allotment of money,

516
00:30:29,380 --> 00:30:33,160
uh, and it's essentially equivalent
to a minimum wage job or,

517
00:30:33,220 --> 00:30:37,510
or even a little bit less. Uh, and you
have to decide how to spend your money.

518
00:30:38,050 --> 00:30:41,710
And the idea is to increase empathy with
people who are homeless or people who

519
00:30:41,711 --> 00:30:44,890
are poor. Uh, by saying like,
Hey, look, this is really hard.

520
00:30:45,340 --> 00:30:46,450
If you make these choices,

521
00:30:46,451 --> 00:30:49,030
you're gonna make bad choices or
you're not going to be able to afford

522
00:30:49,031 --> 00:30:52,240
everything and you're going to have to
figure out what you value the most. Right.

523
00:30:52,990 --> 00:30:53,650
Uh,

524
00:30:53,650 --> 00:30:57,220
the interesting thing that came out of
this was someone did a psych study after

525
00:30:57,221 --> 00:31:01,810
the game came out and they ran it with
people who had predispositions against

526
00:31:02,110 --> 00:31:04,930
poor people, uh, and
thought, you know, oh,

527
00:31:04,931 --> 00:31:08,820
they're just making bad choices in
life and this is their own fault. Uh,

528
00:31:08,821 --> 00:31:10,090
and after playing the game,

529
00:31:10,540 --> 00:31:14,350
they found that they actually were more
inclined to believe that than they were

530
00:31:14,351 --> 00:31:15,520
before they had played the game.

531
00:31:15,940 --> 00:31:19,330
And the reasoning that the
psychologist to Deuce, um,

532
00:31:19,390 --> 00:31:23,110
was that the game was designed in such
a way that it presented you with lots of

533
00:31:23,111 --> 00:31:23,890
choices.

534
00:31:23,890 --> 00:31:28,090
And so if you were playing through the
game and you made all these choices and

535
00:31:28,091 --> 00:31:32,620
you got to a certain stage and
the game said, Oh, you lost,

536
00:31:32,770 --> 00:31:37,480
you spent all your money, now you're poor
and homeless, right? Uh, you went, oh,

537
00:31:37,481 --> 00:31:41,080
well I just, I should have just made this
other choice over there. Well, oh, well,

538
00:31:41,170 --> 00:31:42,970
but somebody would have
made that choice in like,

539
00:31:42,971 --> 00:31:46,900
why didn't they make that choice? And you
just kind of project this idea of, well,

540
00:31:46,901 --> 00:31:49,660
if I had just made these choices,
everything would've been fine.

541
00:31:49,690 --> 00:31:51,520
Maybe I didn't make the
right one in this situation,

542
00:31:51,521 --> 00:31:54,400
but there was a right choice and I should
have made it and they should have as

543
00:31:54,401 --> 00:31:58,840
well. Um, and so that kind
of tied in this idea of like,

544
00:31:58,841 --> 00:32:02,740
if I have complete control of a
situation and something goes wrong,

545
00:32:02,770 --> 00:32:05,920
then I just made a wrong choice as
opposed to sometimes there are things that

546
00:32:05,921 --> 00:32:09,580
are outside of my control and there's
nothing I can do about it. And so we,

547
00:32:09,590 --> 00:32:13,330
we did a lot in the game, uh,
that you have no control over.

548
00:32:13,450 --> 00:32:17,050
There is no right answer. There's no
choice that gets you out of a situation,

549
00:32:17,410 --> 00:32:21,880
you're just in it now. Right.
Um, and Kamers do not like that.

550
00:32:22,360 --> 00:32:25,510
They play games. Uh, I think a
lot of people play games. There's,

551
00:32:25,511 --> 00:32:28,420
there's been a lot of kind of studies on
this and people play games because they

552
00:32:28,421 --> 00:32:30,220
like having to,
you know,

553
00:32:30,250 --> 00:32:32,890
having all these options and being able
to do what they want and being able to

554
00:32:32,891 --> 00:32:37,210
have control of the character. And so
when you take that away, um, they don't,

555
00:32:37,240 --> 00:32:41,510
they don't like it. That's strange.
Um, and so I think the, uh,

556
00:32:42,530 --> 00:32:45,590
the expectation from our
side was, hey, you know,

557
00:32:46,130 --> 00:32:48,560
we're making these choices intentionally
and people are going to figure it out

558
00:32:48,590 --> 00:32:50,960
and they're going to realize why we made
these choices and they're going to be

559
00:32:50,961 --> 00:32:53,450
okay with it. And, uh, I don't think it's,

560
00:32:53,451 --> 00:32:55,500
I don't think it's quite
worked out that way. Um,

561
00:32:55,790 --> 00:32:58,650
and I think those have led
to a lot of our, our, uh,

562
00:32:58,700 --> 00:33:03,560
lack of financial success with the game
on the industry influence side.

563
00:33:03,650 --> 00:33:05,960
Uh, we've definitely
contributed to the discussion.

564
00:33:06,160 --> 00:33:09,140
This was a talk I gave
it at GDC last year,

565
00:33:09,141 --> 00:33:10,940
which is the big game
developer conference.

566
00:33:11,900 --> 00:33:15,890
And we've had a bunch of people talk to
us about their personal experiences and

567
00:33:15,891 --> 00:33:17,660
how they're excited to see,
you know,

568
00:33:17,690 --> 00:33:21,460
more people of Color in games and more
people of Color on development teams. Um,

569
00:33:21,461 --> 00:33:24,530
and, and the work that we've done to
try to, to talk about the game and,

570
00:33:24,531 --> 00:33:27,680
and to spread awareness about these
initiatives and that sort of thing.

571
00:33:27,681 --> 00:33:32,210
So that's been really rewarding. Uh,
there was one particular point where, um,

572
00:33:32,330 --> 00:33:36,740
there was a developer from Cameroon who
was at a convention with us and they

573
00:33:36,741 --> 00:33:39,600
were telling us that they saw
our game get coverage, uh,

574
00:33:39,601 --> 00:33:44,090
in games press and that they felt that
that meant people were actually okay

575
00:33:44,091 --> 00:33:45,830
talking about black characters in games,

576
00:33:45,831 --> 00:33:49,550
which is simultaneously really depressing.
That that had to be a thing that they,

577
00:33:49,910 --> 00:33:53,420
uh, were aware of. But
then also, you know,

578
00:33:53,690 --> 00:33:57,020
very rewarding that we were able to
kind of help give them confidence to,

579
00:33:57,170 --> 00:33:57,920
you know,

580
00:33:57,920 --> 00:34:01,910
talk about their game more with us press
and talk about it in that context. So,

581
00:34:02,360 --> 00:34:06,560
yeah, I mean, I think this is the games
industry has had a long history of,

582
00:34:06,561 --> 00:34:09,680
of issues around race and
representation and, uh,

583
00:34:09,800 --> 00:34:11,570
there are more discussions happening now.

584
00:34:11,660 --> 00:34:15,350
I think it still remains to be seen how
much people actually follow through on

585
00:34:15,351 --> 00:34:19,910
that and not just talk about it. Um,
so we'll see. We'll see how that goes.

586
00:34:20,330 --> 00:34:24,350
Hopefully sooner rather than
later. Uh, and going forward,

587
00:34:24,620 --> 00:34:27,000
we're working with a nonprofit.
Uh,

588
00:34:27,140 --> 00:34:29,110
we have two nonprofits that
we're partnered with. Uh,

589
00:34:29,150 --> 00:34:32,730
this one in particular works
in, uh, high schools, uh,

590
00:34:32,750 --> 00:34:37,730
to help kids who are at risk for joining
gangs or who have already joined. Um,

591
00:34:37,760 --> 00:34:41,280
they're basically the last resort before
they get suspended from school. Uh,

592
00:34:41,290 --> 00:34:44,990
and they're trying to convince them like,
Hey, we've been down this road before.

593
00:34:45,020 --> 00:34:47,290
All the people who are
instructors and their program, uh,

594
00:34:47,360 --> 00:34:51,020
used to be in gangs and they basically
say like, Hey, we've been down this path.

595
00:34:51,021 --> 00:34:54,120
Here's how you can get out. Here's
how we can help you stay out. Um,

596
00:34:54,200 --> 00:34:58,340
and here's how we can get you back in
school and get you on a road to success.

597
00:34:58,341 --> 00:35:03,230
And to, you know, thrive and
lead a lead a good life. Um,

598
00:35:03,260 --> 00:35:07,100
and so we're working with them to try to
get the game into schools to help kids

599
00:35:07,101 --> 00:35:11,720
be able to talk about these experiences.
Um, and we're hoping to expand that.

600
00:35:11,721 --> 00:35:12,680
And then again,
like I said,

601
00:35:12,681 --> 00:35:17,060
we're working with a psychology professor
to hopefully figure out how effective

602
00:35:17,061 --> 00:35:18,410
the game actually is and,

603
00:35:18,440 --> 00:35:22,730
and what kind of impact it's actually
having so that we can speak to that, um,

604
00:35:23,630 --> 00:35:26,720
in a, in a more direct way with
actual evidence about, you know,

605
00:35:26,721 --> 00:35:31,370
here's a rigorous study that shows that
this is actually effective. Um, yeah,

606
00:35:32,090 --> 00:35:34,960
so that is the overview.
Um,

607
00:35:34,970 --> 00:35:37,770
and then we're going to do a Q
and a session I think now. Yeah.

608
00:35:38,790 --> 00:35:40,720
Yeah.
Thanks.

609
00:35:46,040 --> 00:35:47,660
First off, thank you for that, Michael.

610
00:35:47,661 --> 00:35:50,270
We really appreciate sharing
your insight and you know,

611
00:35:50,271 --> 00:35:54,200
going through the process of creating
that game. And now as Mike mentioned, a,

612
00:35:54,260 --> 00:35:58,100
we definitely want to take some time to
field some questions from you guys. Um,

613
00:35:58,101 --> 00:36:00,790
I know I have a couple in
mind. Um, I can start it off.

614
00:36:00,791 --> 00:36:03,500
Would you guys definitely think of some
questions that we can start to get to.

615
00:36:04,130 --> 00:36:09,080
Um, so for starters, I guess like who
was your intended audience for the game?

616
00:36:09,110 --> 00:36:12,200
Like obviously I'm sure you're trying to
get it out to as many folks as possible,

617
00:36:12,201 --> 00:36:15,830
but yeah, from the beginning and like
who was the initial intended audience?

618
00:36:15,940 --> 00:36:19,630
Yeah, so this is something that's changed
over the, the development process.

619
00:36:19,631 --> 00:36:23,500
When we started it was originally we want
to talk to people who are not from the

620
00:36:23,501 --> 00:36:27,580
south side and, and give them an
exposure to this experience and,

621
00:36:27,581 --> 00:36:32,200
and help them kind of engage with us
and talk about it in a personal way.

622
00:36:32,790 --> 00:36:37,000
Uh, as the game went along, we
were talking to Tony in particular,

623
00:36:37,001 --> 00:36:39,640
kept talking about all of his friends
wanting to play the game and getting

624
00:36:39,641 --> 00:36:41,560
really excited about
playing the game. Um, and,

625
00:36:41,630 --> 00:36:45,580
and working with reclaim our kids to talk
about using it in schools for kids who

626
00:36:45,581 --> 00:36:47,920
are from the south side and west side.
Um,

627
00:36:47,980 --> 00:36:51,770
and I think that became an additional
market that we were interested in,

628
00:36:51,771 --> 00:36:55,110
in trying to get the game
too. And, and trying to, um,

629
00:36:56,140 --> 00:36:57,710
develop some additional things for us.

630
00:36:57,711 --> 00:37:01,360
So we actually did some play tests with
some kids from the south and west side,

631
00:37:01,660 --> 00:37:05,180
uh, on a couple of occasions.
And one of the kids said, uh,

632
00:37:05,350 --> 00:37:10,060
basically he had been held up a couple
of days previously and seeing it to

633
00:37:10,061 --> 00:37:13,110
picked it again and the game was
kind of traumatic for him. Uh,

634
00:37:13,280 --> 00:37:18,280
and so we added a mode basically right
before launch and that allows you to

635
00:37:18,281 --> 00:37:22,330
disable the visual elements during
violence scenes and it just puts up texts

636
00:37:22,331 --> 00:37:24,070
that says what's happening.
Um,

637
00:37:24,090 --> 00:37:28,450
as a way to kind of give people who
are in this and have this as a personal

638
00:37:28,451 --> 00:37:28,991
experience,

639
00:37:28,991 --> 00:37:32,560
a little bit of space if they need it
to be able to experience the whole game

640
00:37:32,561 --> 00:37:33,690
without,
you know,

641
00:37:33,700 --> 00:37:38,410
having to be traumatically
reliving experiences that
you've potentially recently

642
00:37:38,411 --> 00:37:39,244
had.

643
00:37:39,510 --> 00:37:41,400
Got It. Got It. Yeah. Um,

644
00:37:41,430 --> 00:37:45,930
also I was just curious about where
can we find this game if we wanted to

645
00:37:45,931 --> 00:37:48,060
purchase it and also how much is the game.

646
00:37:48,170 --> 00:37:52,790
Yeah. Uh, so the game is up
on our website, which is we
are Chicago game.com. Uh,

647
00:37:52,820 --> 00:37:54,950
and it's normally $15.
It's like

648
00:37:55,130 --> 00:37:59,330
there's an off right now. So Nice.
Very nice. Yeah. Yeah, yeah. Cool.

649
00:37:59,970 --> 00:38:04,770
Hi. Can you talk a little bit
about the assumptions, um,
that really came to light,

650
00:38:04,790 --> 00:38:07,920
you know, when working with this writer
that kind of brought in an entirely new

651
00:38:07,921 --> 00:38:12,180
perspective when developing the
story and also on that note,

652
00:38:12,181 --> 00:38:14,130
can you talk a little bit about,
you know,

653
00:38:14,190 --> 00:38:18,240
why you did choose a game as a medium
for this? Because I think this is a,

654
00:38:18,241 --> 00:38:22,110
you know, a big topic of discussion
across media in general. But yeah,

655
00:38:22,320 --> 00:38:24,360
really interested to
hear, you know, why game.

656
00:38:24,790 --> 00:38:26,960
Sure. Yeah. So the, the
game thing first, uh,

657
00:38:27,130 --> 00:38:30,700
we chose the game because
you're interacting, right?

658
00:38:30,790 --> 00:38:34,030
Because you have to make choices.
You have to rationalize it to yourself.

659
00:38:34,031 --> 00:38:37,660
You have to justify those in your own
mind and you're playing as a character.

660
00:38:37,840 --> 00:38:40,210
So it's not necessarily the same
choices that you would make.

661
00:38:40,211 --> 00:38:42,720
And we don't present you with
an unlimited set of options.

662
00:38:42,740 --> 00:38:46,240
You still have some constraints
on how you can respond,

663
00:38:46,540 --> 00:38:50,650
but those choices that you're
justifying personally to yourself,

664
00:38:50,680 --> 00:38:54,490
even in the context of the character
are way more engaging than watching

665
00:38:54,491 --> 00:38:55,181
somebody else do it.

666
00:38:55,181 --> 00:38:59,050
And it also speaks to the
kind of judgements that a
lot of people pass, right?

667
00:38:59,230 --> 00:39:02,770
If you're watching a documentary about
somebody who's living in a low income

668
00:39:02,771 --> 00:39:06,130
neighborhood and you think, oh, they
just made bad choices, or you know,

669
00:39:06,160 --> 00:39:08,320
if I was in that situation,
I would have done something differently.

670
00:39:08,320 --> 00:39:12,040
A game basically says,
here are your choices.

671
00:39:12,070 --> 00:39:15,880
Make some choice that you think is
better and see how it plays out. Right?

672
00:39:16,120 --> 00:39:19,120
And so I think from that perspective,
if it's done well, again,

673
00:39:19,150 --> 00:39:23,770
like spent as the model of, you know,
this is not how to do it. Right. Um, and,

674
00:39:23,820 --> 00:39:25,120
and to be fair,

675
00:39:25,121 --> 00:39:28,270
like we didn't know that that wasn't
how to do it until they did that.

676
00:39:28,271 --> 00:39:32,040
And the s psych study came out.
So, um, it was an important, like,

677
00:39:32,050 --> 00:39:34,810
kind of first step in that.
But I think if you do it right and you,

678
00:39:34,811 --> 00:39:38,320
and you can textualize it correctly,
I think it can be way more impactful than,

679
00:39:38,380 --> 00:39:43,270
than, uh, a film. And to the other
question about, um, uh, kind of,

680
00:39:43,940 --> 00:39:44,130
uh,

681
00:39:44,130 --> 00:39:49,030
a lot of the stuff came out of just
like mindset differences about like how

682
00:39:49,031 --> 00:39:53,380
people are perceiving the things that
are happening. Um, and I, I think,

683
00:39:55,120 --> 00:39:58,450
I'm trying to think of exactly
how to, how to say this, but like,

684
00:39:58,451 --> 00:40:02,320
like basically we came into a
lot of situations thinking, okay,

685
00:40:02,830 --> 00:40:06,880
these are terrifying experiences or
they're very traumatic experiences or

686
00:40:06,881 --> 00:40:09,530
they're extremely exceptional experiences.
And,

687
00:40:09,640 --> 00:40:13,630
and to realize and to really put yourself
in the position of actually these

688
00:40:13,631 --> 00:40:17,920
happen frequently enough that
people are not, you know,

689
00:40:17,921 --> 00:40:21,430
constantly in fear and they're
not constantly upset about
them. You know, I mean,

690
00:40:21,431 --> 00:40:22,750
like, they might be upset
about them all the time,

691
00:40:22,751 --> 00:40:25,300
but they're not afraid of
them all the time. Right.

692
00:40:25,450 --> 00:40:30,060
Because it's just what you live in
now. Um, and, and I think that was, uh,

693
00:40:30,490 --> 00:40:34,210
those sorts of realizations shaped how
we were talking about things in the

694
00:40:34,211 --> 00:40:36,790
script and, and, and what things
we want it to talk about a lot.

695
00:40:39,290 --> 00:40:43,500
Okay. Okay. Okay. Yeah.

696
00:40:44,260 --> 00:40:47,200
How does the game, and like two
or three ways in which the game,

697
00:40:47,420 --> 00:40:49,060
can you talk a little bit about that?
Uh,

698
00:40:49,061 --> 00:40:53,110
so you mean from like a story
perspective or from, okay,

699
00:40:53,560 --> 00:40:58,200
spoiler alerts. Uh, yeah. So, yeah.

700
00:40:59,280 --> 00:41:02,080
Yeah. Um, yeah, let me see.

701
00:41:02,081 --> 00:41:06,540
Let me see if I can figure out a way
to not spoil everything. Uh, yeah.

702
00:41:06,600 --> 00:41:09,010
I don't know if I can. Um, uh,

703
00:41:09,040 --> 00:41:13,600
so basically the set up for the story is
you're hanging out with your friends a

704
00:41:13,601 --> 00:41:16,660
lot and they stop hanging out with you
and you don't know exactly what's going

705
00:41:16,661 --> 00:41:19,150
on and you find out through
the course of the game, uh,

706
00:41:19,250 --> 00:41:22,500
that they've joined rival
gangs essentially. Um,

707
00:41:22,540 --> 00:41:24,490
and so you have to kind
of talk to them about,

708
00:41:24,790 --> 00:41:28,000
you're trying to convince them that
they've made bad choices and that you want

709
00:41:28,001 --> 00:41:29,830
to get them out. Um, and
they're telling you, hey,

710
00:41:29,831 --> 00:41:31,180
I've made these choices for a reason.

711
00:41:31,181 --> 00:41:35,000
Like I don't have any educational
going forward past high school.

712
00:41:35,001 --> 00:41:38,750
I don't have any job opportunities
because of the situation that I'm in.

713
00:41:38,930 --> 00:41:42,380
And because of my family, uh, there
were a lot of discussions about, um,

714
00:41:42,381 --> 00:41:45,060
kind of family influences
where, you know, if your,

715
00:41:45,170 --> 00:41:48,080
if your father or your
brother is involved in a gang,

716
00:41:48,290 --> 00:41:50,770
you're assumed to be in
that as well and you're,

717
00:41:50,771 --> 00:41:55,180
you're kind of excluded from a lot
of opportunities. And so, um, it's,

718
00:41:55,210 --> 00:41:58,070
it's a lot about talking about these
kinds of reasons that people are choosing

719
00:41:58,071 --> 00:42:02,550
to join s stuff and make these choices
that from the outside seem very odd and

720
00:42:02,551 --> 00:42:06,460
end. Like, why would you make that
choice? Um, and so in the end, uh,

721
00:42:06,580 --> 00:42:10,140
the game kind of concludes
with your friends, um,

722
00:42:10,220 --> 00:42:13,590
having to reconcile the fact
that they're in rival gangs. Uh,

723
00:42:13,610 --> 00:42:16,970
let me put it that way. And then,
uh, and you kind of frank too,

724
00:42:17,030 --> 00:42:20,120
to keep everybody safe and mitigate
that as much as possible. Is that,

725
00:42:20,150 --> 00:42:23,070
is that a good enough answer without
spoiling everything? Yeah. Okay.

726
00:42:30,970 --> 00:42:31,803
Yeah,
yeah,

727
00:42:31,960 --> 00:42:33,060
yeah.
It would be.

728
00:42:36,920 --> 00:42:40,790
Right, right, right. And, and I think,
so we made, we made a choice early on.

729
00:42:40,791 --> 00:42:45,200
Part of it was from a kind of budget
constraint perspective of if we have to

730
00:42:45,201 --> 00:42:46,011
make two different endings,

731
00:42:46,011 --> 00:42:48,410
there's a lot of additional content and
a lot of additional things that we have

732
00:42:48,480 --> 00:42:52,640
to create to make that happen. So we
didn't want to have a divergent ending.

733
00:42:52,641 --> 00:42:56,100
But I think another part of it that came
in later was this idea of like there

734
00:42:56,140 --> 00:42:58,670
some things that you just don't have
control over in your friends making these

735
00:42:58,671 --> 00:43:01,760
choices are things you don't
have control over. So um,

736
00:43:01,761 --> 00:43:04,520
a lot of that kind of came out
of the design decisions early on.

737
00:43:05,800 --> 00:43:10,660
Yeah,
yeah,

738
00:43:13,220 --> 00:43:14,053
yeah.

739
00:43:14,620 --> 00:43:18,040
I think the entire time you were talking
I was thinking like how do we get this

740
00:43:18,041 --> 00:43:21,180
into the hands of that Hashtag
all lives matter crowd. Yeah.

741
00:43:21,850 --> 00:43:25,270
And I'm curious like how you guys have
been thinking about getting the game into

742
00:43:25,271 --> 00:43:28,390
the hands of people who will self
select out of wanting to play it.

743
00:43:28,391 --> 00:43:29,171
Because to me,

744
00:43:29,171 --> 00:43:33,520
that seems like one of the core
important audiences for this,

745
00:43:33,521 --> 00:43:38,440
because as you said with the empathy and
the kind of ability to understand what

746
00:43:38,441 --> 00:43:41,920
people go through it and not be able to
hand waves their experiences would be

747
00:43:41,921 --> 00:43:43,870
really impactful for
this country as a whole.

748
00:43:44,190 --> 00:43:45,660
Right, right. Totally agree. Yeah.

749
00:43:45,661 --> 00:43:50,661
So originally our intention when we
started the project was to present this as

750
00:43:51,421 --> 00:43:55,170
an interesting narrative experience and
to not talk about the fact that it's

751
00:43:55,260 --> 00:43:57,720
talking about south side Chicago
and talking about, you know,

752
00:43:57,721 --> 00:44:01,490
the African American experience
and in cities in Chicago or in, in,

753
00:44:01,500 --> 00:44:02,710
in the United States.
Um,

754
00:44:02,790 --> 00:44:07,140
and the hope was if we pitched it
enough as a narrative experience, uh,

755
00:44:07,170 --> 00:44:10,470
that we could convince the audience
that plays narrative games,

756
00:44:10,471 --> 00:44:14,430
which does have some overlap as we
found out at various conventions. Um,

757
00:44:14,460 --> 00:44:14,770
there's a,

758
00:44:14,770 --> 00:44:19,650
there's a fairly big game called a walking
dead telltale walking dead game. Um,

759
00:44:19,710 --> 00:44:23,340
and it's kind of the game that started
a lot of the hype about narrative driven

760
00:44:23,341 --> 00:44:26,080
games. Um, and the main
character is black. Um,

761
00:44:26,190 --> 00:44:30,090
and there's a lot of discussion in the
game about kind of the way he's treated

762
00:44:30,091 --> 00:44:31,500
because of his race.
Right.

763
00:44:32,220 --> 00:44:35,850
And we literally had multiple people
come up to us while we were demoing the

764
00:44:35,851 --> 00:44:38,820
game, uh, at various conventions
that would say like, oh,

765
00:44:38,821 --> 00:44:42,360
the game wasn't about a black person
or he wasn't black or things like that.

766
00:44:42,361 --> 00:44:44,160
And you're like,
how can you be making these statements?

767
00:44:44,161 --> 00:44:46,290
Like this is a focal point of,

768
00:44:46,291 --> 00:44:50,790
part of the story is that he's black and
he's being treated differently. So, um,

769
00:44:50,850 --> 00:44:51,121
yeah,

770
00:44:51,121 --> 00:44:55,020
I think it's a huge challenge to try to
figure out how to get it in their hands.

771
00:44:55,021 --> 00:44:55,291
And,

772
00:44:55,291 --> 00:45:00,030
and I think one thing that we kind
of realized was we didn't have,

773
00:45:01,380 --> 00:45:04,800
we didn't have a way that we could
market the game that would make me feel

774
00:45:04,801 --> 00:45:09,030
comfortable marketing it and that way and
still get it into that, that audience,

775
00:45:09,420 --> 00:45:13,350
because we didn't want to paint the
neighborhood is always terrible.

776
00:45:13,351 --> 00:45:14,910
Everything terrible all the time.
Right?

777
00:45:14,911 --> 00:45:16,980
We wanted to talk about the
positive things that were happening.

778
00:45:16,981 --> 00:45:19,860
We have great moments where you're sitting
down with your family and like kind

779
00:45:19,861 --> 00:45:23,370
of having these familial experiences
and there's a poetry slam where you feel

780
00:45:23,371 --> 00:45:25,860
very accomplished for being able to like
express yourself and talk about what's

781
00:45:25,861 --> 00:45:27,280
happening in your life.
Um,

782
00:45:27,290 --> 00:45:30,690
and so we wanted to make sure that the
game was not all negative all the time.

783
00:45:30,960 --> 00:45:31,451
Uh,
and,

784
00:45:31,451 --> 00:45:36,390
and the way that games generally are
marketed to people is high drama,

785
00:45:36,391 --> 00:45:39,870
high action, lots of violence,
things happening all the time. Right?

786
00:45:40,260 --> 00:45:41,760
And so to get it to that audience,

787
00:45:41,761 --> 00:45:46,020
we had to do things that we weren't
comfortable doing. Um, and we didn't,

788
00:45:46,050 --> 00:45:50,430
we never really figured out how to resolve
that, that situation. I do think, um,

789
00:45:51,090 --> 00:45:53,790
really long answer, I really,
I do think that the, uh,

790
00:45:53,820 --> 00:45:57,940
the reclaim our kids
getting it into schools, um,

791
00:45:58,170 --> 00:46:01,440
is an interesting avenue to do
that. Um, I think a lot of like,

792
00:46:01,441 --> 00:46:05,550
there's been talk about how a lot of
trolling and stuff online is like 12 year

793
00:46:05,551 --> 00:46:08,370
olds and stuff, right? Um, and I
think if we can get it into schools,

794
00:46:08,371 --> 00:46:11,120
not just on the south side of
Chicago, but across, you know,

795
00:46:11,190 --> 00:46:14,070
the whole Chicago Public School
district or something to that effect,

796
00:46:14,280 --> 00:46:18,150
I think those are ways that we can
start impacting, maybe not, you know,

797
00:46:18,450 --> 00:46:21,750
the people who are already 20,
30 years old and our, you know,

798
00:46:21,780 --> 00:46:23,670
racist and making comments
all over the place.

799
00:46:23,671 --> 00:46:28,170
But if we can start a little bit younger
and, and reach a wider school audience,

800
00:46:28,171 --> 00:46:30,600
I think that could be an avenue
that would, that would be effective.

801
00:46:31,400 --> 00:46:35,280
I guess my question is at the
beginning of a lot of video, uh,

802
00:46:35,330 --> 00:46:39,820
video games and even, um,
like movies or films. Yeah.

803
00:46:39,890 --> 00:46:42,080
You always see the,

804
00:46:42,110 --> 00:46:46,780
I guess the combination of why things
got this way or how it got that way. Hmm.

805
00:46:46,940 --> 00:46:50,940
Um, I think between, uh,

806
00:46:51,040 --> 00:46:55,580
either kids that are in the environment
or kids that are not in the environment,

807
00:46:56,000 --> 00:46:59,780
I think that would be the main question
is like, okay, this is happening,

808
00:47:00,590 --> 00:47:04,820
this is here. But how did this get, like,

809
00:47:04,821 --> 00:47:09,800
why is this like this? How did this get
like this? What's the story behind it?

810
00:47:09,801 --> 00:47:14,550
And I think with that you get
to be in a sense educational,

811
00:47:14,920 --> 00:47:19,160
um, informative, which
is the same thing. Uh,

812
00:47:19,220 --> 00:47:24,220
and you kind of move closer towards
the solution rather than just telling a

813
00:47:26,601 --> 00:47:27,990
story for sure him.

814
00:47:27,991 --> 00:47:32,991
And I want to know if that in the game
or if that was a part and like how deep

815
00:47:33,401 --> 00:47:34,510
you went with that.

816
00:47:34,850 --> 00:47:39,820
Yeah. Yeah. So our approach, we didn't do
kind of the upfront version of that. Um,

817
00:47:39,880 --> 00:47:42,200
what we try to do is work it
into a lot of the conversations.

818
00:47:42,201 --> 00:47:45,140
So when you're sitting at the park
and you're talking to your friends,

819
00:47:45,320 --> 00:47:49,220
they'll talk about how they can't get
a job or they'll talk about a housing

820
00:47:49,221 --> 00:47:51,470
discrimination or things
like that. Um, and they'll,

821
00:47:51,500 --> 00:47:56,500
they'll bring up the kind of historical
reasons of how we got here with red

822
00:47:57,281 --> 00:48:02,210
lining and housing discrimination
and, and, uh, you know,
the highway system that,

823
00:48:02,211 --> 00:48:03,350
you know,
all that kind of stuff.

824
00:48:03,470 --> 00:48:06,230
They'll talk about that
stuff in the context of the
problems that they're having

825
00:48:06,231 --> 00:48:08,060
right now. Um, so that was our,

826
00:48:08,090 --> 00:48:12,230
that was our kind of experiment to
see if we could get some of the, the

827
00:48:13,880 --> 00:48:18,500
historical educational information
across in a more natural way for the

828
00:48:18,501 --> 00:48:21,410
characters be talking
about it. Um, and I again,

829
00:48:21,770 --> 00:48:24,740
just like study is going to be very
useful to find out if that was actually

830
00:48:24,741 --> 00:48:25,131
effective.

831
00:48:25,131 --> 00:48:27,470
If people actually got something out
of that or if they were just like,

832
00:48:27,471 --> 00:48:30,910
that was a weird conversation, why would
you be talking about that? Um, but I,

833
00:48:30,920 --> 00:48:33,500
I think that's, that's the approach that
we took and we're going to see if it,

834
00:48:33,530 --> 00:48:34,520
if it was effective,

835
00:48:34,521 --> 00:48:38,900
but to us it was about kind of telling
this consistent narrative story

836
00:48:38,901 --> 00:48:42,830
throughout the,
the game experience and not theirs.

837
00:48:43,130 --> 00:48:46,460
There's some games that kind of take
you out of the experience and say like,

838
00:48:46,461 --> 00:48:49,220
and now we're going to play this video
or we're going to play this cinematic or

839
00:48:49,221 --> 00:48:52,100
do something that doesn't seem like
it fits with the context of the game.

840
00:48:52,340 --> 00:48:55,670
And we wanted to avoid that as much as
possible, like all the menus for the game.

841
00:48:55,671 --> 00:48:58,360
Everything exists in
the world. Um, and the,

842
00:48:58,450 --> 00:49:01,460
the idea was we want you to have this
kind of continuous experience of this

843
00:49:01,461 --> 00:49:04,670
person's life so that you don't have
anything that you think like, oh,

844
00:49:04,671 --> 00:49:08,270
well if I filled in that blank with a
better choice than I could have gotten out

845
00:49:08,271 --> 00:49:11,840
of this. Right. Um, so that was kind of
our thought behind it. Um, and we're,

846
00:49:11,841 --> 00:49:14,730
we're trying to get that kind of
educational information across. It's just,

847
00:49:14,890 --> 00:49:19,780
Gosh, I think, um, I'm glad to hear that.
Yeah. Like baked into it and that's good.

848
00:49:20,590 --> 00:49:25,240
Um, I think a lot of times, even sometimes
with my work or anybody else's work,

849
00:49:25,241 --> 00:49:30,130
I think what lacks, um, or
what, what helps people,

850
00:49:30,131 --> 00:49:33,430
I guess fully understand something or
fully understand what they're getting

851
00:49:33,431 --> 00:49:37,330
ready to experience is context.
Right. And so, you know,

852
00:49:37,331 --> 00:49:40,300
while you're talking about the kids
that were like making these insensitive

853
00:49:40,301 --> 00:49:41,780
jokes or whatever,
right.

854
00:49:41,800 --> 00:49:46,660
Sometimes I feel like if they were to
see almost like a trailer of like, okay,

855
00:49:46,661 --> 00:49:51,430
like a piece of context,
then you can go, oh, okay,

856
00:49:51,880 --> 00:49:54,250
maybe now I want to see, you
know, what this is about.

857
00:49:54,251 --> 00:49:59,251
And I think what would spur people to
kind of jump into it rather than just

858
00:50:01,360 --> 00:50:04,510
throwing them in the middle of, you
know, yeah. I haven't played it yet,

859
00:50:04,511 --> 00:50:06,250
so I can't say what it is,

860
00:50:06,280 --> 00:50:10,900
but it just feels like I need
for people to know, okay,

861
00:50:10,930 --> 00:50:14,860
this people just aren't out here,
poor aren't out here.

862
00:50:15,280 --> 00:50:19,250
Disadvantaged. Because they were like,
hey, I want to be the disadvantage. Right,

863
00:50:19,360 --> 00:50:23,630
right, right. It's been
like this systematic things.
Yeah. I think that's the,

864
00:50:24,410 --> 00:50:27,940
yeah. The length that I think you have
in there. I just want to, yeah, yeah,

865
00:50:28,120 --> 00:50:31,190
yeah, yeah. Yeah. And I think
to, to that, uh, to that point,

866
00:50:32,810 --> 00:50:36,770
we're hoping that the game essentially
mirrors our own process of,

867
00:50:36,771 --> 00:50:40,100
of developing the game for the
players were, when I got started,

868
00:50:40,101 --> 00:50:42,560
I didn't understand them
a lot of that context.

869
00:50:42,561 --> 00:50:44,690
I didn't really know a lot of that detail,

870
00:50:44,840 --> 00:50:47,840
but when I heard the stories that
people were telling, I was like,

871
00:50:47,900 --> 00:50:52,640
this is really strange. Like, why is this
happening? Why is this the situation?

872
00:50:52,641 --> 00:50:56,390
And that spurred me to find out more
and to do more research into and to read

873
00:50:56,391 --> 00:50:58,230
more about it and think more about it.
Um,

874
00:50:58,260 --> 00:51:02,780
and so we're hoping that the game kind
of gives you this like really high level.

875
00:51:02,990 --> 00:51:06,680
Here's some stuff that's very interesting
that you should be thinking about and

876
00:51:06,681 --> 00:51:10,820
then start those discussions and start
kind of a more in depth in depth research

877
00:51:10,821 --> 00:51:13,910
project of sorts into that after
the fact. Right. So you can,

878
00:51:13,911 --> 00:51:16,130
you can play the game and then go,
that was interesting.

879
00:51:16,131 --> 00:51:18,880
I want to know about more about this
and look it up online or, you know,

880
00:51:19,170 --> 00:51:20,990
find out more stuff. Yeah, thanks.

881
00:51:21,100 --> 00:51:23,460
Thank you for that. Um, I know
we have a couple of minutes left.

882
00:51:23,520 --> 00:51:25,210
Definitely want to get to
the last question over here.

883
00:51:25,211 --> 00:51:30,211
So I was wondering what
sort of inspiration you took
from the current narrative

884
00:51:32,350 --> 00:51:34,120
driven games that are out there right now,

885
00:51:34,121 --> 00:51:39,100
like Firewatch and gone home and what
lessons you learned about keeping people

886
00:51:39,160 --> 00:51:41,290
engaged with the interactive
elements of the game.

887
00:51:42,070 --> 00:51:45,930
Yeah. Yeah. So gone home was
super inspirational for us. Um,

888
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:48,310
I think that the two biggest
inspirations were, uh,

889
00:51:48,400 --> 00:51:52,840
well maybe three has gone home,
the walking dead. And then, um,

890
00:51:52,990 --> 00:51:56,680
there was another game that's not exactly
narrative driven but it's cart life.

891
00:51:57,010 --> 00:51:57,340
Um,

892
00:51:57,340 --> 00:52:01,030
and cart life of the guy that was making
cart life was basically talking about

893
00:52:01,031 --> 00:52:06,031
how he wanted the game mechanics to kind
of create in the player the emotions

894
00:52:06,911 --> 00:52:08,830
that the character was experiencing.

895
00:52:08,831 --> 00:52:11,260
So if the character was
experiencing something tedious,

896
00:52:11,860 --> 00:52:14,980
the game play should be tedious to kind
of replicate that experience to the

897
00:52:14,981 --> 00:52:15,850
player.
Um,

898
00:52:15,870 --> 00:52:18,630
and so we did a couple of those things
with like setting the table and,

899
00:52:18,631 --> 00:52:21,910
and like stuff at work that's
like really boring and monotonous,

900
00:52:21,911 --> 00:52:24,070
but it kind of sets up these,
these bigger,

901
00:52:24,080 --> 00:52:27,860
more dramatic things that
happened afterwards and kind
of give some contrast. Um,

902
00:52:27,900 --> 00:52:31,660
and walking dead gave us a lot of
inspiration for a kind of character

903
00:52:31,661 --> 00:52:35,050
development. And what was
the, what was a good, um,

904
00:52:35,110 --> 00:52:38,110
kind of dynamics to have
between the player and the,

905
00:52:38,111 --> 00:52:41,590
and the other characters in the story?
Uh, so we, we played a lot with that. Um,

906
00:52:41,890 --> 00:52:42,700
and then,
uh,

907
00:52:42,700 --> 00:52:47,560
gone home was a lot of
like kind of filling out
environmental storytelling and,

908
00:52:47,561 --> 00:52:49,670
and things like that,
which we try to do. Um,

909
00:52:49,690 --> 00:52:51,010
we didn't get as much in as we wanted,

910
00:52:51,011 --> 00:52:54,610
but that was a big focus was trying to
tell a lot of things through what's on

911
00:52:54,611 --> 00:52:58,840
somebody's desk or what's up on the wall
as opposed to just being very explicit

912
00:52:58,890 --> 00:53:03,820
and put it in through voiceover
or, or voice acting. Um, so yeah,

913
00:53:03,821 --> 00:53:06,220
there was, there were definitely
lots of inspirations. That aesthetic.

914
00:53:06,700 --> 00:53:11,690
Yeah. Does that, yeah. A second
half was, what did you learn about

915
00:53:13,280 --> 00:53:14,930
keeping people engaged
through interacting,

916
00:53:15,110 --> 00:53:18,380
getting people engaged? Yeah. So, um, uh,

917
00:53:18,410 --> 00:53:22,940
we have definitely
learned that play testers,

918
00:53:22,941 --> 00:53:24,270
both,
uh,

919
00:53:24,350 --> 00:53:29,350
like play testers that we organized and
playtesting at conventions is not a good

920
00:53:29,941 --> 00:53:33,450
representation of what a
person at home and play as.

921
00:53:33,870 --> 00:53:34,980
We have a lot of,

922
00:53:35,130 --> 00:53:37,500
we had a lot of stuff that we had been
doing throughout development where we

923
00:53:37,501 --> 00:53:39,840
were kind of saying like, okay, uh,

924
00:53:40,200 --> 00:53:42,480
people are responding well to
this and this is working out well.

925
00:53:42,481 --> 00:53:46,320
And then when we get to a release
and consumer reviews are out, um,

926
00:53:46,590 --> 00:53:50,460
there were a lot of choices that we
made that again, like slower pacing and,

927
00:53:50,461 --> 00:53:55,200
and things to that effect that did
not go over well with like consumer,

928
00:53:55,590 --> 00:53:57,160
uh, response. Um,

929
00:53:57,240 --> 00:54:00,600
but worked fine in our play tests or
worked fine on a convention for when they

930
00:54:00,601 --> 00:54:02,370
were playing the game for 20 minutes.
Uh,

931
00:54:02,390 --> 00:54:05,760
so we thought we'd learned a bunch of
stuff about how we could slow down the

932
00:54:05,761 --> 00:54:07,650
pacing.
And then when we got it released,

933
00:54:07,651 --> 00:54:11,260
we found out that a lot of people didn't
respond as well as we thought. Um,

934
00:54:11,550 --> 00:54:15,990
so I don't know we have
a good solution for, uh,

935
00:54:16,590 --> 00:54:21,570
like slower pacing or making
the narrative, um, move
in a more realistic pace.

936
00:54:21,840 --> 00:54:24,700
Uh, but I do think it is kind of a, uh,

937
00:54:25,980 --> 00:54:29,190
a process that the industry has to go
through where we don't really have an

938
00:54:29,191 --> 00:54:32,250
audience that is looking for this
and games and the people who would be

939
00:54:32,251 --> 00:54:35,040
interested in this don't think
of themselves as gamers. Um,

940
00:54:35,110 --> 00:54:37,410
and so I think we're at a
stage now where it's just,

941
00:54:37,470 --> 00:54:41,970
we're so early on that we need more games
like this to come out and to encourage

942
00:54:41,971 --> 00:54:45,910
other people to get into games and
to be interested in, in games, uh,

943
00:54:45,920 --> 00:54:48,990
so that we can kind of grow that audience
and make it an actual market that we

944
00:54:48,991 --> 00:54:49,560
can target.
