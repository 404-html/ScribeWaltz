1
00:00:06,120 --> 00:00:09,660
It's really a pleasure to be here and
talking about something that was one of my

2
00:00:09,661 --> 00:00:10,760
passions,
uh,

3
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:15,720
in recent years and something that I've
really come to enjoy the full process

4
00:00:15,721 --> 00:00:17,930
of. And that's something
that I wanted to share. Um,

5
00:00:18,090 --> 00:00:22,890
I struggled a bit in trying to come up
with exactly how I wanted to frame this

6
00:00:22,891 --> 00:00:23,640
talk,

7
00:00:23,640 --> 00:00:28,630
whether or not I should go into kind of
the nitty nitty gritty details or give a

8
00:00:28,650 --> 00:00:33,090
more full blown look at everything
that might go into this. And uh,

9
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:35,100
I decided I'd go into the,
uh,

10
00:00:35,130 --> 00:00:40,020
inch deep mile wide type of approach and
cover all of the different things that

11
00:00:40,021 --> 00:00:41,550
people might enjoy.
Uh,

12
00:00:41,610 --> 00:00:45,990
my goal at the end of this is to show you
all of the different complexities that

13
00:00:45,991 --> 00:00:49,710
go into running a game as well as
hopefully convince a couple of view to

14
00:00:49,711 --> 00:00:52,500
possibly try it out. So, uh, with that,

15
00:00:52,560 --> 00:00:56,490
I just want to cover a little bit of my
background as far as how it helps out,

16
00:00:56,760 --> 00:00:59,520
uh, in discussion. Let's
talk, uh, like many folks,

17
00:00:59,521 --> 00:01:03,150
I grew up playing video games
all through my childhood.

18
00:01:03,151 --> 00:01:06,150
It was something that was
a great activity for me.

19
00:01:06,180 --> 00:01:10,290
I've formed bonds with all sorts of games
and really enjoyed just playing and,

20
00:01:10,530 --> 00:01:13,710
and learning the lessons that
they had for me. But beyond that,

21
00:01:13,770 --> 00:01:16,200
it was an activity.
It was something that I enjoyed it.

22
00:01:16,201 --> 00:01:19,470
It was not something that I
had intended to turn into,

23
00:01:19,471 --> 00:01:21,660
kind of a lifelong passion.
Um,

24
00:01:21,900 --> 00:01:26,520
my first foray into more competitive
focus gaming occurred, uh,

25
00:01:26,521 --> 00:01:28,050
in my teenage years.
I was,

26
00:01:28,110 --> 00:01:32,610
became part of the Super Smash Brothers
Melee competitive community in the mid

27
00:01:32,611 --> 00:01:34,350
two thousands.
And that was,

28
00:01:34,380 --> 00:01:38,700
that was transformational for me
is something where I was good,

29
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:42,780
I was not great, but it was something
that let me travel to tournaments.

30
00:01:42,930 --> 00:01:45,590
I could do a meet up
with all sorts of people,

31
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:46,980
get different perspectives on that.

32
00:01:46,981 --> 00:01:49,570
And really some of my best
memories are part of that. But, uh,

33
00:01:49,620 --> 00:01:54,240
back on the real life side of things, uh,
I went through and started my schooling,

34
00:01:54,510 --> 00:01:55,650
um,
went through,

35
00:01:55,651 --> 00:02:00,180
got masters degrees in
computer engineering and cyber
operations as far as how

36
00:02:00,181 --> 00:02:03,000
that applies to the talk.
Uh, it really is just my,

37
00:02:03,030 --> 00:02:08,030
my note though of I have
a formal background in
engineering software development

38
00:02:08,220 --> 00:02:10,930
as well as reverse engineering and,
uh,

39
00:02:11,090 --> 00:02:15,570
let's say knowing how to
treat software creatively, uh,

40
00:02:15,571 --> 00:02:18,610
to try and get certain things
out of it. Uh, and I'm very, uh,

41
00:02:18,780 --> 00:02:23,460
fortunate to be able to continue that
in my professional work with MIT. Um,

42
00:02:23,820 --> 00:02:26,910
but really what we're here to talk
about today is the speed earning side of

43
00:02:26,911 --> 00:02:29,500
things. And this is something
that I started up because I,

44
00:02:29,540 --> 00:02:32,070
I missed out on all of this,
uh,

45
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:36,390
kind of competitive aspects that I had
to drop when I started school of, um,

46
00:02:36,420 --> 00:02:37,320
super smash brothers.

47
00:02:37,320 --> 00:02:40,980
But I also had this deep nostalgia for
all these games that I played as a kid.

48
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:45,250
And speed running was my way to
actually dive into that. And, um,

49
00:02:45,300 --> 00:02:49,350
over the course of the last 10
years or so, I've speed run,

50
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:53,850
I've completed speed runs of more than
two dozen different games and most of

51
00:02:53,851 --> 00:02:57,840
which from scratch. So I'm hoping to kind
of share some of those lessons today,

52
00:02:58,110 --> 00:03:01,990
uh, as we go through more
of the talk. But, uh,

53
00:03:02,260 --> 00:03:06,520
that's the main thing we're talking about
today is of course video games and um,

54
00:03:06,580 --> 00:03:08,660
we'll differentiate that online.
Um,

55
00:03:08,710 --> 00:03:11,830
usually by just putting it as one word
instead of two to differentiate it from

56
00:03:11,860 --> 00:03:15,880
athletic running. But when we're talking
about here is completing a game quickly.

57
00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:17,073
Um,

58
00:03:17,170 --> 00:03:21,400
the duration of this usually goes from
the time that you press start until the

59
00:03:21,401 --> 00:03:22,420
time the credits roll.

60
00:03:22,660 --> 00:03:26,920
And what I'm going to be talking about
today is all things performed by hand.

61
00:03:27,190 --> 00:03:29,290
All things that are done
without tool assistants.

62
00:03:29,470 --> 00:03:33,160
There are other types of speed runs that
are performed with tool assistance. Uh,

63
00:03:33,161 --> 00:03:34,900
and there's,
they're really interesting,

64
00:03:34,901 --> 00:03:36,430
they have a whole bunch of
other different things to them.

65
00:03:36,431 --> 00:03:39,740
But for the lessons that I'm going
to be talking about today, uh,

66
00:03:39,940 --> 00:03:42,760
we're going to be just focusing
on the human element to things.

67
00:03:43,090 --> 00:03:47,380
Some other important lingo, uh, as
we go through this is category a.

68
00:03:47,381 --> 00:03:51,070
And when a speed runner or anybody
else talks about a category, uh,

69
00:03:51,130 --> 00:03:53,020
there are really talking
about the rule sets,

70
00:03:53,050 --> 00:03:57,520
the restrictions and the goals that
they're trying to perform this run under.

71
00:03:57,810 --> 00:04:01,740
Um, and this is really important because
it will differentiate something, um,

72
00:04:01,750 --> 00:04:05,740
a speed run done with no restrictions
versus one that's done towards complete

73
00:04:05,741 --> 00:04:08,150
item collection or restricting different,
uh,

74
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:13,270
techniques that you might be able to use.
So that's what it is.

75
00:04:13,480 --> 00:04:18,430
Why would you want to do it? What a lot
of people see is the competitive aspect.

76
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:21,850
Uh, it's something that,
uh, if you get good enough,

77
00:04:21,880 --> 00:04:24,400
you can claim that you are the
best in the world at something.

78
00:04:24,640 --> 00:04:28,290
And that's certainly a worth
of bragging rights. Uh,

79
00:04:28,390 --> 00:04:30,850
there's a real sense of
accomplishment that comes from that.

80
00:04:31,240 --> 00:04:35,620
But I would say that that's actually
kind of in the minority of primary

81
00:04:35,890 --> 00:04:38,760
motivations and why you'd
want to get involved. Um,

82
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:43,270
what's a much bigger piece of
that is actually diving into,

83
00:04:43,650 --> 00:04:46,970
uh, the community side
of speed runs. So, um,

84
00:04:47,020 --> 00:04:51,690
one of the things that is really good
for newcomers is that as you come in, um,

85
00:04:51,790 --> 00:04:53,830
there's all sorts of people
who will be supporting you,

86
00:04:53,831 --> 00:04:56,540
who will be commenting on you,
um,

87
00:04:56,590 --> 00:05:00,400
enjoying your own progress as you go
through and try to challenge yourself,

88
00:05:00,610 --> 00:05:03,760
reach new goals,
and really test your own limits.

89
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,880
And that's kind of the
most fulfilling part. Um,

90
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:09,460
and a lot of people are drawn to that.

91
00:05:09,550 --> 00:05:11,740
They don't necessarily need
to be the best in the world,

92
00:05:11,980 --> 00:05:14,800
but they really want something that will
let them play the games that they love

93
00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:19,060
and enjoy it in a brand new way. And
that's what speed runs help to accomplish.

94
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:24,340
But why would you choose speed
as a particular challenge?

95
00:05:24,341 --> 00:05:28,390
Why not score or some other difficult
type of challenge in the game? Well,

96
00:05:28,391 --> 00:05:31,900
that's where things get a little technical
speed is important because it has a

97
00:05:31,901 --> 00:05:34,630
number of different trade
offs that really, uh,

98
00:05:35,980 --> 00:05:40,900
they increased the difficulty of
performing at a, at the human level. And,

99
00:05:41,260 --> 00:05:44,350
uh, one of the examples that I have
for this on the chart on the left,

100
00:05:44,530 --> 00:05:49,100
this is just a quick graph
showing the time taken, uh,

101
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:51,790
to travel one mile as
you increment speeds.

102
00:05:52,090 --> 00:05:55,450
And the thing to note here is
that as you're going forward,

103
00:05:55,570 --> 00:05:58,280
you're actually encountering
diminishing returns.

104
00:05:58,460 --> 00:06:00,890
So for each additional unit of speed,

105
00:06:00,920 --> 00:06:03,080
let's say that it took the same
amount of effort to increase,

106
00:06:03,170 --> 00:06:05,720
to increase one unit of speed.
As it goes,

107
00:06:05,900 --> 00:06:09,110
you're actually getting less and less
benefit. The further along it goes.

108
00:06:09,590 --> 00:06:12,110
And that's really important
when you're trying to,

109
00:06:12,290 --> 00:06:17,290
let's say save a small fractions of a
second because that means that for every

110
00:06:17,450 --> 00:06:20,480
new small amount of time
that you're shaving off,

111
00:06:20,630 --> 00:06:24,350
that's a huge amount more effort
in order to get to that next step.

112
00:06:25,490 --> 00:06:26,570
The other side of things,

113
00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:31,600
if you treat the game as just a black
box and you're sending inputs to it,

114
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:35,660
uh,
to try and achieve some optimal goal,

115
00:06:35,690 --> 00:06:40,440
some a state within the game that is
going to tell you you've succeeded. Uh,

116
00:06:40,460 --> 00:06:44,440
this is a classic state explosion problem.
Um,

117
00:06:44,480 --> 00:06:48,670
even in a game that only responds to two
different inputs, you have a case of, uh,

118
00:06:48,860 --> 00:06:50,430
just even for one second of Gameplay,

119
00:06:50,480 --> 00:06:54,470
you're looking at a 120 bits of possible
paths to search through and try and get

120
00:06:54,471 --> 00:06:58,640
that that's on par with some of the
cryptographic a block ciphers that we have

121
00:06:58,641 --> 00:07:01,940
today.
And that's just not happening.

122
00:07:02,060 --> 00:07:04,010
But of course you can cut that down.

123
00:07:04,011 --> 00:07:08,720
Use intuition to ha to try and limit the
number of paths that you need to search.

124
00:07:09,020 --> 00:07:11,960
But at this point it's not
even really playing the game.

125
00:07:12,320 --> 00:07:15,230
This is trying to treat it
as an optimization problem.

126
00:07:16,340 --> 00:07:19,310
And this is actually a really important
point that I want to draw some more

127
00:07:19,311 --> 00:07:20,144
attention to.

128
00:07:20,300 --> 00:07:24,560
So we're going to take a slight break
and go into something a little different.

129
00:07:24,830 --> 00:07:25,663
Let's talk about art.

130
00:07:26,780 --> 00:07:31,780
So this is a particular image from artists
[inaudible] and I am just about the

131
00:07:32,871 --> 00:07:36,170
last person that you want talking
anything about art and characteristics,

132
00:07:36,171 --> 00:07:40,580
but it seems perfectly competent.
It's pretty, uh, it's, and some,

133
00:07:40,640 --> 00:07:44,570
a piece of art and an East Asian
style seems fine. I'd have,

134
00:07:44,660 --> 00:07:47,000
I'd be happy to have this up in my home.
Um,

135
00:07:47,210 --> 00:07:51,380
the caveat on this particular piece of
art is that it was created in Microsoft

136
00:07:51,381 --> 00:07:53,180
Excel.
Um,

137
00:07:53,450 --> 00:07:58,450
and this is just about the last thing
that people would expect to use from

138
00:07:58,760 --> 00:08:00,410
Microsoft for Microsoft Excel.

139
00:08:00,411 --> 00:08:04,790
This is a program built up entirely
around data tabulation and organization.

140
00:08:05,060 --> 00:08:06,830
And you have,
uh,

141
00:08:06,890 --> 00:08:11,120
Mr [inaudible] here is using it to set
up all sorts of things to create this

142
00:08:11,121 --> 00:08:11,954
fantastic picture.

143
00:08:12,410 --> 00:08:17,210
And this just goes to show that just
because excel was created to work with

144
00:08:17,211 --> 00:08:20,690
numbers, it doesn't mean you can't do
other things with it. Um, and in fact,

145
00:08:20,750 --> 00:08:24,230
it has all the functionality that you
can needs there to create something like

146
00:08:24,231 --> 00:08:26,480
that. Um, and he's not the only one.

147
00:08:26,480 --> 00:08:30,050
There's hundreds of other people who
will do art in excel just because it has

148
00:08:30,051 --> 00:08:34,820
the tools available and it's something
that they can easily get to and work

149
00:08:34,821 --> 00:08:39,120
with. Um, might not be as powerful
as illustrator or something else, uh,

150
00:08:39,260 --> 00:08:40,220
meant for that purpose.

151
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:44,780
But it is effective and it's still lets
people reach their creative expression

152
00:08:44,990 --> 00:08:49,340
and create the products that they want.
So what about speed runs?

153
00:08:51,260 --> 00:08:54,380
What, um, what a lot of people,
uh, casual observers and,

154
00:08:54,381 --> 00:08:56,190
and other people who
are watching speed runs,

155
00:08:57,230 --> 00:09:01,470
a lot of their first impressions are,
that's not how I played the game. That's,

156
00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:03,300
that's not what the developer
intended for the game.

157
00:09:03,840 --> 00:09:08,310
And in a lot of ways the right, uh,
that doesn't really matter though.

158
00:09:08,340 --> 00:09:12,600
The goal here is to create an
optimized solution through the game.

159
00:09:13,380 --> 00:09:15,150
The game itself,
the narrative,

160
00:09:15,151 --> 00:09:18,420
all of the different elements that the
developers put into it to try and make an

161
00:09:18,421 --> 00:09:21,620
experience don't matter as much.
Um,

162
00:09:22,530 --> 00:09:26,490
it's still the game, but they're more
concerned with this is the world.

163
00:09:26,520 --> 00:09:30,420
These are the rules that I need to
work within to try and reach my end

164
00:09:30,421 --> 00:09:33,720
destination.
And that's really what's going on here.

165
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:39,440
But if the speed runners aren't bounded
by the rules set by the developers,

166
00:09:39,841 --> 00:09:40,710
what are they bounded by?

167
00:09:41,070 --> 00:09:46,070
And this is where we go into a lot of
other topics dealing with how speed run

168
00:09:46,481 --> 00:09:50,250
should be organized.
What constitutes a valid speed run?

169
00:09:50,430 --> 00:09:53,190
How do you make things
comparable? Um, for example,

170
00:09:53,191 --> 00:09:57,690
even the timing methodology is something
that varies pretty significantly by the

171
00:09:57,691 --> 00:10:01,100
different games. Um, some
of the major timing, um,

172
00:10:01,110 --> 00:10:03,060
methodologies that are listed
on the right side vaguely.

173
00:10:03,330 --> 00:10:06,300
But the main thing is that
what you're measuring,

174
00:10:07,140 --> 00:10:09,390
even though you're
getting a metric of time,

175
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:12,480
what you're measuring is actually
the skill of your performance.

176
00:10:12,750 --> 00:10:15,900
And it's always important to keep that
in mind as you're trying to set up these

177
00:10:15,901 --> 00:10:18,330
different qualifications
on what's happening.

178
00:10:18,630 --> 00:10:20,640
And as you look through
some of these other topics,

179
00:10:20,670 --> 00:10:23,610
really what we're doing is this
is all experimental design.

180
00:10:24,090 --> 00:10:28,230
You want to create something
that is comparable between
different people forming

181
00:10:28,231 --> 00:10:33,231
under the same set of goals
and restrictions so that
you can determine is this

182
00:10:33,401 --> 00:10:34,860
from better,
is that run better?

183
00:10:35,130 --> 00:10:37,380
What is the skill that they
use to accomplish this?

184
00:10:37,560 --> 00:10:42,030
And that's largely what happens with
speed or an organization, but that's,

185
00:10:42,031 --> 00:10:47,010
that's just the highest level a look at
kind of how speedruns or formed talking

186
00:10:47,011 --> 00:10:49,980
about everything that a speed run is.
From here on,

187
00:10:50,010 --> 00:10:52,290
I really want to talk about
how to do a speed run.

188
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:55,080
And that's kind of where
the meat of things is. Um,

189
00:10:55,300 --> 00:10:57,210
and really the most interesting parts,

190
00:10:57,600 --> 00:11:00,500
the general process that I devised and,

191
00:11:00,501 --> 00:11:05,280
and really espouse in this is going
through a three, three phase approach. Uh,

192
00:11:05,310 --> 00:11:09,180
you start out with investigation where
you're trying to understand what,

193
00:11:09,240 --> 00:11:12,640
what is the game that I'm working with?
What are its limits? What can I do? Um,

194
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:15,690
you take that knowledge and you apply it.
Once you get to routing,

195
00:11:15,930 --> 00:11:19,200
where you actually make the decisions
you want to come up with, here's my path.

196
00:11:19,500 --> 00:11:23,690
Uh, these are the set of decisions that
I'm going to respond to and really, uh,

197
00:11:23,820 --> 00:11:27,090
what I believe to actually make an
optimal solution going through this game.

198
00:11:27,510 --> 00:11:31,290
And then finally you get to execution
because just having a theory about what's

199
00:11:31,700 --> 00:11:36,600
a fastest isn't good enough, you need
to actually put it through the end,

200
00:11:36,780 --> 00:11:41,780
make your best attempt to reproduce
that particular route and then go from

201
00:11:42,691 --> 00:11:46,320
there. This is not a waterfall
style approach though. Um,

202
00:11:46,350 --> 00:11:50,280
there's all manner of things that you
might find and you're going to wind up

203
00:11:50,281 --> 00:11:54,940
going back to earlier parts just so that
you either increase your understanding,

204
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:58,600
make some different decisions
when something doesn't
work out right and really

205
00:11:58,601 --> 00:11:59,680
still,
um,

206
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:03,670
at the end you're always getting
to this point of doing the run.

207
00:12:04,030 --> 00:12:05,290
And that's kind of the important piece.

208
00:12:05,320 --> 00:12:09,850
So what I'm going to go through here is
just some of the major topics in each of

209
00:12:09,851 --> 00:12:13,720
these as we go through.
So investigation,

210
00:12:13,810 --> 00:12:16,750
a lot of people will skip
over investigation or they
won't give it the proper

211
00:12:16,751 --> 00:12:21,250
credit, uh, do just because
it's not the most glamorous. Um,

212
00:12:21,280 --> 00:12:23,350
really what you're trying
to do is catalog data.

213
00:12:23,560 --> 00:12:26,980
You're trying to build up your own
knowledge pool as you're going through and

214
00:12:27,460 --> 00:12:30,640
making sure that you actually document
it correctly. I want to get into notes,

215
00:12:30,641 --> 00:12:33,580
making sure it's communicated out so
other people can follow the same thing.

216
00:12:33,850 --> 00:12:38,850
But this is basically the entire phase
where your understanding of the game and

217
00:12:38,921 --> 00:12:41,950
that understanding is really what
you're going to be exploiting as you go

218
00:12:41,951 --> 00:12:45,460
through each individual step.
But for understanding,

219
00:12:45,670 --> 00:12:50,290
you really have to first understand,
um, what else is out there. And,

220
00:12:50,590 --> 00:12:54,520
um, the very first thing that you should
do is just go out there and find what is

221
00:12:54,521 --> 00:12:57,580
known. Uh, this might be
kind of an obvious step,

222
00:12:57,760 --> 00:13:00,520
but really the depth that you go through,
this is

223
00:13:02,100 --> 00:13:03,980
kind of surprising to a lot of people.
Uh,

224
00:13:04,050 --> 00:13:07,600
obviously you start with seeing if
there's other speed runs and I'm not just

225
00:13:07,601 --> 00:13:11,890
talking about speed run videos. Uh,
find out if there's other comments,

226
00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:13,480
other posts.

227
00:13:13,481 --> 00:13:18,481
I the thing that's actually indicative
of the thought process that a person went

228
00:13:18,521 --> 00:13:19,660
through in planning a speed run,

229
00:13:19,870 --> 00:13:23,080
it's all very important because you'll
be able to work with that and go from

230
00:13:23,081 --> 00:13:24,200
there.
Um,

231
00:13:24,370 --> 00:13:28,690
the second level where you're still going
to find a lot of useful information is

232
00:13:28,691 --> 00:13:32,080
just the general, um, guides
for a particular game.

233
00:13:32,110 --> 00:13:36,100
So the players guides anything
online, game guide, related, uh,

234
00:13:36,130 --> 00:13:38,440
different fan franchise, uh, sites.

235
00:13:38,590 --> 00:13:41,170
We'll have a lot of useful information
that other fans of cataloged,

236
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:43,990
maybe not for the purpose of the
speed run, but it's data to you.

237
00:13:44,110 --> 00:13:46,450
So you're going to take
it in all the same. Um,

238
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:50,200
where a lot of people miss out is
actually in these, these tier three, uh,

239
00:13:50,560 --> 00:13:51,670
types of resources.

240
00:13:51,671 --> 00:13:56,410
And the way that I've set up the tears
is just the likelihood that you're going

241
00:13:56,411 --> 00:13:57,640
to find useful information.

242
00:13:58,030 --> 00:14:02,470
But in the same way you might find some
of the most interesting stuff when you

243
00:14:02,471 --> 00:14:05,440
start to really stretch the
limits of what you're looking at.

244
00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:08,920
So finding any other
related gameplay videos,

245
00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:12,490
there's actually a lot of times then
that people are doing a let's play and

246
00:14:12,491 --> 00:14:14,080
they'll do something weird and like,
oh,

247
00:14:14,180 --> 00:14:17,040
I didn't know that would happen and a
speed run. We'll come along. And like,

248
00:14:17,410 --> 00:14:21,720
I can use that. And it's really important
to kind of go through that steps. Um,

249
00:14:21,820 --> 00:14:24,630
but international sites is
also something that, uh,

250
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:29,830
really doesn't occur to a lot of people.
In some of my own research,

251
00:14:29,831 --> 00:14:33,490
I was working on a game called
front mission gun hazard
and it's a Japanese only

252
00:14:33,491 --> 00:14:37,260
game. So, of course, most of the resources
that are going to be in Japanese on,

253
00:14:37,290 --> 00:14:38,990
on the other side of the Internet that,
uh,

254
00:14:39,070 --> 00:14:41,350
I don't go to very often because
I can't read it very well,

255
00:14:41,860 --> 00:14:45,220
but I'm in actually doing the do,

256
00:14:45,340 --> 00:14:47,390
do effort and going over there,
uh,

257
00:14:47,420 --> 00:14:51,500
I was able to find a loan page on
some fan sites squirreled away that a

258
00:14:51,501 --> 00:14:53,100
particular glitch.
Um,

259
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:56,390
and it had enough details in there
that I was able to figure it out and

260
00:14:56,391 --> 00:14:57,021
reproduce it.

261
00:14:57,021 --> 00:15:00,680
And that actually ended up getting used
in a speed run to pretty good effect.

262
00:15:00,710 --> 00:15:01,430
So that was,

263
00:15:01,430 --> 00:15:06,170
that was my story about a really going
the extra mile and trying to investigate

264
00:15:06,171 --> 00:15:08,900
that. But this is all about
everything that is known.

265
00:15:09,680 --> 00:15:11,270
What do you do for the
things that aren't known?

266
00:15:12,260 --> 00:15:15,860
And for that we go back to our
good old friend scientific method.

267
00:15:16,280 --> 00:15:21,280
One of the biggest things that is really
exciting about this part is the raw

268
00:15:22,341 --> 00:15:24,320
discovery of what it is
that you're looking at.

269
00:15:24,560 --> 00:15:27,480
So just imagine that all of physics,
the,

270
00:15:27,500 --> 00:15:29,300
everything that we knew about
physics was wiped clean.

271
00:15:29,570 --> 00:15:31,820
Like you could still tell
that when you throw a ball,

272
00:15:31,821 --> 00:15:33,200
it's going to follow some sort of arc,

273
00:15:33,410 --> 00:15:36,390
but you don't know the mechanics
behind it. You don't know, uh,

274
00:15:36,410 --> 00:15:38,600
let's say what the constant of
gravity is or anything else like that.

275
00:15:39,140 --> 00:15:42,890
That's something that you do every time
that you step into a new video game and

276
00:15:42,891 --> 00:15:45,680
you're really trying to figure
out how do these things interact.

277
00:15:45,680 --> 00:15:49,040
What are the rules that govern how
they actually work? And for that,

278
00:15:49,100 --> 00:15:52,550
the scientific method is
perfect for actually going
through and figuring out the

279
00:15:52,551 --> 00:15:55,070
individual things.
And for many of us,

280
00:15:55,071 --> 00:15:58,680
this is something that we don't get the
chance to use in our daily lives. Um,

281
00:15:58,940 --> 00:16:03,290
it something that they taught to us in
middle school and we knew it enough to

282
00:16:03,291 --> 00:16:04,580
pass the test. But, uh,

283
00:16:04,581 --> 00:16:08,690
getting an actual opportunity to
exercise it is something that, uh,

284
00:16:09,890 --> 00:16:12,950
for everybody I've talked to is to try
to experience this is really rewarding

285
00:16:12,951 --> 00:16:15,290
when you actually come through
and you figure out, wow,

286
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:17,240
that particular formula works this way.

287
00:16:17,390 --> 00:16:19,640
Or I didn't know I could
influence it with um,

288
00:16:19,880 --> 00:16:22,700
trying to just run up and kick
a wall or something like that.

289
00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:27,050
And really you just follow the same
steps of identifying what it is that you

290
00:16:27,051 --> 00:16:30,170
actually want to know. Developing
hypothesis, setting up an experiment,

291
00:16:30,380 --> 00:16:33,890
and then ultimately trying to analyze
the results of that experiment and decide

292
00:16:33,891 --> 00:16:35,210
how it actually impacts things.

293
00:16:35,390 --> 00:16:38,480
And that's how you build up all of the
knowledge that isn't already known and

294
00:16:38,481 --> 00:16:39,320
written down elsewhere.

295
00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:43,880
But this has helped a little bit simply
because you're living in a land of

296
00:16:43,881 --> 00:16:48,710
software, which means that everything in
that world is going to be bounded by the

297
00:16:48,711 --> 00:16:49,790
restraints of software.

298
00:16:49,791 --> 00:16:54,350
And really everything is governed by
some amount of math and that's really

299
00:16:54,380 --> 00:16:56,930
everything. Um, for a
lot of casual players,

300
00:16:56,931 --> 00:17:01,931
they don't realize that let's say the
power upstate of Mario and Super Mario

301
00:17:01,971 --> 00:17:06,200
world is actually governed by a single
address that is responding to whatever

302
00:17:06,201 --> 00:17:09,620
that value is. All right,
that's interesting to know,

303
00:17:09,650 --> 00:17:13,160
but why would I care about
that as a speed rider? Well,

304
00:17:13,161 --> 00:17:18,020
it just so happens that that
particular value goes into a,

305
00:17:18,050 --> 00:17:22,160
an index into a big table that you might
be able to do some funny things with

306
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:27,370
and you get some fantastic results just
as long as you know, uh, the math and,

307
00:17:27,371 --> 00:17:29,900
and fundamentals behind
that. Uh, beyond that,

308
00:17:30,020 --> 00:17:33,260
some of the other things that you kind
of take for granted are still governed by

309
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:38,210
different calculations. For
example, a typical hit box scenario,

310
00:17:38,450 --> 00:17:42,140
and this is basically when two objects
deciding whether they're colliding or not,

311
00:17:42,350 --> 00:17:45,620
is simply whether two squares are
overlapping on a Cartesian, ma'am,

312
00:17:46,460 --> 00:17:49,470
something relatively simple
to do and implement. Uh,

313
00:17:49,620 --> 00:17:53,220
but it's not immediately apparent simply
because of all of the artistic work on

314
00:17:53,221 --> 00:17:56,160
top of the game that's going on.
And then of course,

315
00:17:56,161 --> 00:18:00,000
there's also just the regular formulas
of the final fantasy five sore damage

316
00:18:00,001 --> 00:18:01,470
formula illustrated there at the bottom.

317
00:18:01,800 --> 00:18:06,120
And the important part is knowing all
of the different pieces that go into it.

318
00:18:06,121 --> 00:18:07,200
But as a speed runner,

319
00:18:07,210 --> 00:18:12,210
you will absolutely need to know what all
of those different factors are and how

320
00:18:12,271 --> 00:18:17,250
best you can optimize it so that you
wind up with a enough damage to take out

321
00:18:17,251 --> 00:18:19,320
that boss and a certain number of turns.

322
00:18:19,620 --> 00:18:21,840
And that's the kind of thing that
you're going to try and look for.

323
00:18:22,530 --> 00:18:24,390
The last thing in investigation,

324
00:18:24,420 --> 00:18:27,900
and this is probably the most fun
for a lot of people, is discovery.

325
00:18:27,960 --> 00:18:30,690
So once you start to know
what those limits are,

326
00:18:30,870 --> 00:18:34,920
you can really start to push them and
find out other ways to use and abuse the

327
00:18:34,921 --> 00:18:38,430
game beyond what anybody really expected.
Um,

328
00:18:38,970 --> 00:18:42,330
this covers everything from using basic,
uh,

329
00:18:43,290 --> 00:18:45,480
basic aspects of the game.
For example, in mega man,

330
00:18:45,481 --> 00:18:47,310
for if you take damage from an enemy,

331
00:18:47,490 --> 00:18:50,070
you have a brief period of
vulnerability afterwards. Well,

332
00:18:50,071 --> 00:18:53,610
you can abuse that brief
period and vulnerability and
interact with things that

333
00:18:53,611 --> 00:18:56,220
would otherwise instantly kill you
for as long as you're in vulnerable.

334
00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:59,850
So you can use that to your advantage
and skip through some things that, uh,

335
00:19:00,040 --> 00:19:03,990
would otherwise not be.
Uh, very polite. Um,

336
00:19:04,140 --> 00:19:08,430
there's also instances where if you're
know the fundamentals of how the game is

337
00:19:08,431 --> 00:19:10,320
actually operating a,
in this case,

338
00:19:10,321 --> 00:19:12,360
the random number generation
sequence of a game,

339
00:19:12,600 --> 00:19:15,720
you might be able to actually exploit
that so you can make what would be a lucky

340
00:19:15,721 --> 00:19:17,490
occurrence into a consistent occurrence.

341
00:19:17,700 --> 00:19:21,810
And that's something that we're getting
a much more exposure to recently as

342
00:19:21,811 --> 00:19:25,920
people really dive into what makes the
games tick and seeing just how much a

343
00:19:25,921 --> 00:19:27,630
human can interact and influence.

344
00:19:28,950 --> 00:19:32,190
The last thing that I want
to discuss here is, uh,

345
00:19:32,191 --> 00:19:34,560
actually illustrated by that
picture on the right side.

346
00:19:34,830 --> 00:19:36,240
And I really love this picture.

347
00:19:36,270 --> 00:19:39,660
This is from a glitch XP exhibition
for a game called Ocarina of time.

348
00:19:40,260 --> 00:19:45,000
And really
every time that you look at this picture,

349
00:19:45,001 --> 00:19:47,430
you will find something new
that is just out of place.

350
00:19:47,460 --> 00:19:48,720
Even if you're not familiar with the game,

351
00:19:48,721 --> 00:19:51,420
you can probably tell there's a whole
bunch of things in here that aren't going

352
00:19:51,421 --> 00:19:55,860
right. Uh, 21 hearts, 37 keys sold out.

353
00:19:56,040 --> 00:19:57,180
What the heck's going on here?

354
00:19:57,510 --> 00:20:00,810
And what's wonderful about this is
that this is all stuff that is achieved

355
00:20:00,840 --> 00:20:02,040
within the bounds of the game.

356
00:20:02,580 --> 00:20:06,840
You have a player who is going through
and manipulating a game in such a way to

357
00:20:06,841 --> 00:20:11,010
make all of these crazy anomalies that
nobody would normally encounter into a

358
00:20:11,011 --> 00:20:11,844
reality.

359
00:20:11,880 --> 00:20:15,570
And it's the fact that you can stretch
a game to those limits that is really

360
00:20:15,571 --> 00:20:16,800
exciting to a lot of people.

361
00:20:19,550 --> 00:20:24,110
Next up is routing. And this is where
you put all of that information,

362
00:20:24,111 --> 00:20:27,860
all of that extra work in
investigative knowledge to use.

363
00:20:28,190 --> 00:20:32,420
And really what it comes down to is
trying to solve the puzzle of the game and

364
00:20:32,421 --> 00:20:35,570
this code at the full
scope of start to finish,

365
00:20:35,780 --> 00:20:39,860
as well as going down to much
smaller levels, the individual rooms,

366
00:20:39,861 --> 00:20:42,920
the individual patterns that you're
going to need to go through in order to

367
00:20:42,921 --> 00:20:46,940
reach the end solution.
And this is particularly difficult,

368
00:20:47,590 --> 00:20:50,020
especially as a game has a lot
of different variables, has it,

369
00:20:50,021 --> 00:20:52,360
a lot of different options that you
need to try and take into account.

370
00:20:52,660 --> 00:20:56,110
There's a lot of different planning
methodologies and strategies that really

371
00:20:56,111 --> 00:20:58,150
make this successful.
Uh,

372
00:20:58,240 --> 00:21:03,040
one of the main ones that I tried to
work with and tell people to follow is

373
00:21:03,041 --> 00:21:04,990
actually the engineering design process.

374
00:21:05,350 --> 00:21:09,880
And this is one of those standard ways
that an engineer will go through looking

375
00:21:09,881 --> 00:21:10,300
at a,

376
00:21:10,300 --> 00:21:14,260
looking at a product that they want to
design and going through an iterative

377
00:21:14,261 --> 00:21:17,110
process so that they can improve upon it,
meet the needs,

378
00:21:17,140 --> 00:21:19,420
and also still satisfy
a variety of conditions.

379
00:21:19,840 --> 00:21:22,570
It's kind of weird to think
about a speed run as a product,

380
00:21:22,780 --> 00:21:25,210
but really it works really well
here because you're going through,

381
00:21:25,211 --> 00:21:28,780
you're trying to identify a solution
set and then you're trying to make that

382
00:21:28,781 --> 00:21:31,000
solution set work within
your own constraints.

383
00:21:31,270 --> 00:21:34,000
This covers a similar process
to the scientific method.

384
00:21:34,240 --> 00:21:39,220
The particular version of it that I've
set up here, uh, goes through identifying,

385
00:21:39,221 --> 00:21:41,800
actually making sure that you know
what it is that you're trying to solve

386
00:21:41,830 --> 00:21:42,940
because that can get away from you.

387
00:21:42,941 --> 00:21:47,290
And a lot of times enumerating what's
possible comparing them and then

388
00:21:47,291 --> 00:21:50,920
ultimately testing it and making sure
that it works within the full scope of all

389
00:21:50,921 --> 00:21:52,360
the other solutions that
you've come up with.

390
00:21:52,660 --> 00:21:57,370
And then finally using
that and communicating it
either in text and making a

391
00:21:57,371 --> 00:21:59,560
video of it or actually
doing it in a speed run,

392
00:21:59,800 --> 00:22:03,920
so that kind of enumerates the full
process and it's really important to form.

393
00:22:03,920 --> 00:22:08,500
Try and follow this and identify what is
going to make a particular path fastest

394
00:22:08,530 --> 00:22:10,570
and best to try and work with.

395
00:22:10,780 --> 00:22:14,410
One of the other common aspects is
resource management and this is something

396
00:22:14,411 --> 00:22:17,860
that a lot of people will
treat us fairly obvious,

397
00:22:18,190 --> 00:22:22,900
but it becomes a really complex piece
of the puzzle when you start to have to

398
00:22:22,901 --> 00:22:27,040
make trade offs and in this case
you might have an opportunity to,

399
00:22:27,280 --> 00:22:29,950
let's say spend health health
is an important resource.

400
00:22:29,951 --> 00:22:33,550
It's something that you can actually
trade alone in a lot of games for time.

401
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:36,130
You can try and save time
by using your health,

402
00:22:36,190 --> 00:22:39,010
something that you're trying to
otherwise conserve and keep up as high as

403
00:22:39,011 --> 00:22:40,120
possible to reduce risk.

404
00:22:40,150 --> 00:22:43,780
In the same way you might have
other expendable resources
illustrated in this by

405
00:22:43,781 --> 00:22:47,320
bombs, but you have the tradeoffs
of, well, if I keep more bombs,

406
00:22:47,380 --> 00:22:49,270
how can I use those to save time later?

407
00:22:49,540 --> 00:22:54,280
How much is a bomb worth in
terms of the time that it saves?

408
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:55,510
Um,

409
00:22:55,510 --> 00:22:59,650
and this can be used to offset risk trying
to make let's say a boss fight easier

410
00:22:59,651 --> 00:23:04,210
or a next stage, a little more
consistent, things like that. Time.

411
00:23:04,300 --> 00:23:06,850
Time is also an important resource.
And this is the,

412
00:23:06,970 --> 00:23:10,990
in the context of if I spend more
time now, will I save more time later?

413
00:23:11,980 --> 00:23:16,390
It's all trying to make this great
weight measurement about what's actually

414
00:23:16,391 --> 00:23:19,600
going to get you through optimally.
And it's a lot to keep track of,

415
00:23:19,630 --> 00:23:23,680
but when you come up with
something that feels good,

416
00:23:24,520 --> 00:23:28,060
it's just that much more satisfying when
you identify something that trades off

417
00:23:28,061 --> 00:23:32,550
all the risk, gets you through optimally
and you're still looking at a, uh,

418
00:23:32,810 --> 00:23:34,210
a good run.
You know,

419
00:23:34,211 --> 00:23:37,840
resource management is really what comes
out on top as far as how you distribute

420
00:23:37,841 --> 00:23:38,674
your actions.

421
00:23:39,640 --> 00:23:44,640
One of the least recognize pieces of
actually planning out a speed run is

422
00:23:46,131 --> 00:23:50,810
actually working with consistency and
consistency in this case is everything

423
00:23:50,811 --> 00:23:55,811
that has to do with making sure that you
actually go through and succeed in the,

424
00:23:56,810 --> 00:23:59,450
at the very least the worst case,
but most often the average case,

425
00:23:59,630 --> 00:24:04,400
and this is just an example for this,
let's say that there's a four way stop.

426
00:24:04,550 --> 00:24:07,520
You need to travel from home
and go do your groceries at the,

427
00:24:07,610 --> 00:24:10,850
you can eat to go do some chores at the
bank, the grocery in the post office,

428
00:24:11,160 --> 00:24:12,470
you to visit all three returned home.

429
00:24:13,580 --> 00:24:15,980
The distances to all of them
is approximately the same.

430
00:24:16,250 --> 00:24:18,800
How would you actually make
sure that you proceed optimally?

431
00:24:19,040 --> 00:24:20,780
Assuming that you know you don't know,

432
00:24:20,990 --> 00:24:22,670
let's say what the
traffic is on the roads,

433
00:24:22,760 --> 00:24:24,980
you don't know the actual light pattern.

434
00:24:25,070 --> 00:24:27,620
You have no guarantee that it's going
to be green when you're going to it.

435
00:24:27,890 --> 00:24:31,970
So what kind of things can you do to
increase your consistency in getting

436
00:24:31,971 --> 00:24:35,150
through faster? And that's a large
part of what consistency planning is.

437
00:24:35,180 --> 00:24:38,840
So you can in this particular example
and start to think about, well,

438
00:24:38,841 --> 00:24:40,670
if I can do a right turn on red,

439
00:24:40,850 --> 00:24:44,180
so I'm going to basically skip out
on on most of the Times that I would

440
00:24:44,181 --> 00:24:46,820
otherwise get stopped by only a stoplight.
Um,

441
00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:50,270
if I avoid left turn so I don't have
to worry about coming oncoming traffic,

442
00:24:50,360 --> 00:24:53,990
that will also increase my consistency
and actually getting through quickly.

443
00:24:54,290 --> 00:24:56,690
And these are some of the other things
that you really need to think about

444
00:24:56,750 --> 00:24:58,670
making it successful.
There's a,

445
00:24:58,671 --> 00:25:02,990
an example in a game called Castlevania
Symphony symphony of the night that

446
00:25:03,290 --> 00:25:08,290
there is a strategy that if
done successfully saves 10
to 20% off of the current

447
00:25:10,040 --> 00:25:12,290
fastest time and that is
a very competitive game.

448
00:25:12,770 --> 00:25:15,530
The caveat is that to
execute this successfully,

449
00:25:15,740 --> 00:25:19,010
you at the very least need
a one in 4,100 chance.

450
00:25:19,970 --> 00:25:22,850
Nobody has done this yet.
Nobody has even really tried.

451
00:25:23,210 --> 00:25:27,140
And it's just one of those things that
even if you know something is faster,

452
00:25:27,530 --> 00:25:30,960
if it's not going to ever
work out so that, um,

453
00:25:32,450 --> 00:25:35,900
you're going to keep your sanity while
trying to do these attempts, then yeah,

454
00:25:35,901 --> 00:25:37,460
you're probably not going
to try to incorporate it.

455
00:25:39,620 --> 00:25:42,410
The last thing we want to
talk about is execution and

456
00:25:44,150 --> 00:25:47,780
this has everything to do with how you're
actually able to perform in the game.

457
00:25:47,781 --> 00:25:51,050
How are you able to play at a high level,

458
00:25:51,051 --> 00:25:55,670
do human level optimizations
and understand how it is
that you're going to be

459
00:25:55,671 --> 00:25:59,210
able to practice and reinforce these
things mentally when a lot of people are

460
00:25:59,211 --> 00:26:02,270
getting started or just watching
speedruns for the first time.

461
00:26:02,280 --> 00:26:06,320
They see these people doing incredible
things in these games and like, wow,

462
00:26:06,680 --> 00:26:10,090
I'll never be able to do that. They're,
they're superhuman. They've got all these,

463
00:26:10,100 --> 00:26:13,640
these gifts and the abilities and they're
able to complete the game so fast.

464
00:26:13,641 --> 00:26:17,900
It's not something I'd be able to
do. Well at the end of the day, no,

465
00:26:17,960 --> 00:26:21,690
nobody's really superhuman here.
They've just trained excessively, um,

466
00:26:21,920 --> 00:26:25,010
there they didn't get their abilities
by coming into contact with radioactive

467
00:26:25,011 --> 00:26:27,990
spider. That it's much more
along the lines of, uh,

468
00:26:28,030 --> 00:26:31,130
they've put in a whole lot of work.
They've done the training,

469
00:26:31,250 --> 00:26:35,270
they've done all of the practice necessary
to actually reinforce these things

470
00:26:35,271 --> 00:26:36,080
that they're doing.

471
00:26:36,080 --> 00:26:38,870
And then to really cut down on
the overhead of their own actions.

472
00:26:39,170 --> 00:26:40,130
And for that purpose,
the,

473
00:26:40,131 --> 00:26:44,190
it's much more like trying to be a Ninja
and you're trying be an average person,

474
00:26:44,480 --> 00:26:48,720
uh, who just happens to be very trained
in a particular thing and do particularly

475
00:26:48,721 --> 00:26:50,490
well.
And this is something,

476
00:26:50,491 --> 00:26:53,820
there's a lot of strategies is to actually
do this starting first and foremost

477
00:26:54,120 --> 00:26:58,490
with practice. And really what
we're talking about when Prek,

478
00:26:58,500 --> 00:27:00,990
we mentioned practice is
you're trying to learn.

479
00:27:01,840 --> 00:27:06,660
Practice is all about trying
to learn how your body works.

480
00:27:06,900 --> 00:27:11,130
Trying to learn how he, uh, you're
going to respond in certain situations.

481
00:27:11,310 --> 00:27:12,780
Making that,
uh,

482
00:27:12,990 --> 00:27:17,990
really into an automatic mechanism so
that when you come across something,

483
00:27:18,691 --> 00:27:22,400
you don't think about it, you just do
it. And there's a lot of different, uh,

484
00:27:22,590 --> 00:27:24,080
pieces of psychology
that are important here.

485
00:27:24,100 --> 00:27:26,700
Trying to set up appropriate
chunking strategies,

486
00:27:26,701 --> 00:27:28,480
trying to work with scaffolding,
um,

487
00:27:28,980 --> 00:27:33,980
and there's many different aspects to
trying to train effectively so that that

488
00:27:34,831 --> 00:27:39,030
training isn't lost so that,
uh, you actually improve faster.

489
00:27:39,330 --> 00:27:42,570
And it really is just about
understanding your own brain.

490
00:27:44,130 --> 00:27:48,780
But even beyond that,
once you have the practice in,

491
00:27:48,781 --> 00:27:50,190
once you've built up the muscle memory,

492
00:27:50,370 --> 00:27:53,700
there's a lot of things that you really
need to do to rely on the game to

493
00:27:53,701 --> 00:27:58,290
synchronize up those actions. And this
is where, where various cues come in.

494
00:27:58,291 --> 00:28:00,000
So you're looking for things in the game,

495
00:28:00,360 --> 00:28:03,210
things that you generate
yourself or just get a feel for,

496
00:28:03,330 --> 00:28:07,710
to actually set up your actions so that
they actually work within the realm of

497
00:28:07,711 --> 00:28:09,260
what you need to do.
Um,

498
00:28:09,310 --> 00:28:12,410
there's a lot of good examples for
this in super Metroid where, uh,

499
00:28:12,450 --> 00:28:17,130
just by complete chance, uh, the,
there are plants, foreground objects,

500
00:28:17,131 --> 00:28:21,420
other things that you can look for that
you can use to identify where I need to

501
00:28:21,780 --> 00:28:23,040
execute a particular move,

502
00:28:23,310 --> 00:28:27,120
where you need to jump off a wall and
get up to somewhere that you're not

503
00:28:27,121 --> 00:28:27,954
supposed to.

504
00:28:28,200 --> 00:28:30,960
All sorts of things like this that you
can rely on to help you sync up what

505
00:28:30,961 --> 00:28:35,570
you're doing. Um, in there's a, another
example with Mike Tyson's punch out where,

506
00:28:35,740 --> 00:28:36,010
uh,

507
00:28:36,010 --> 00:28:40,260
the developers actually made a dynamic
audience in the background that otherwise

508
00:28:40,261 --> 00:28:42,540
doesn't do a whole lot and you're,
you're primarily focused on the fighter.

509
00:28:42,840 --> 00:28:45,450
But while the fighters
are doing certain things,

510
00:28:45,720 --> 00:28:49,950
they included cues in that audience
that help you to identify when you're

511
00:28:49,951 --> 00:28:53,340
actually supposed to start up a counter
attack when you're supposed to do a

512
00:28:53,341 --> 00:28:57,290
dodge. Some of these examples that are
pretty hard to see in this particular, uh,

513
00:28:57,390 --> 00:28:57,811
pictures.

514
00:28:57,811 --> 00:29:01,470
But there's a guy flashing a camera at
a particular point that you're supposed

515
00:29:01,471 --> 00:29:03,780
to counter attack.
There's another one who drops his glasses.

516
00:29:04,020 --> 00:29:06,810
And all of these little extra details
that the developer is actually included

517
00:29:06,811 --> 00:29:10,710
really help out in trying to identify
how you're going to counter these

518
00:29:10,711 --> 00:29:14,190
otherwise difficult threats.
But even beyond visual things,

519
00:29:14,550 --> 00:29:19,550
audio is really important and this is
important not only from a reaction speed

520
00:29:19,711 --> 00:29:20,520
standpoint,

521
00:29:20,520 --> 00:29:25,290
you can actually respond to audio about
a 20 to 40 milliseconds faster than you

522
00:29:25,291 --> 00:29:29,340
can visual cues. But it's also just
really important in terms of knowing,

523
00:29:29,670 --> 00:29:31,020
let's say I'm in a boss area,

524
00:29:31,380 --> 00:29:35,730
that boss is going to spawn
at a particular time and
the music just so happens

525
00:29:35,731 --> 00:29:39,180
to be synced up with that and this
case, uh, in a game called [inaudible],

526
00:29:39,181 --> 00:29:40,530
which I run,
um,

527
00:29:41,170 --> 00:29:45,310
where you're using a particular part of
that intro sound sequence to know when

528
00:29:45,311 --> 00:29:48,730
to start to launch your attack so that
you can get a very powerful attack in

529
00:29:48,880 --> 00:29:50,530
right at the beginning
when he's first coming out.

530
00:29:51,460 --> 00:29:54,790
One of the last things that I
really want to discuss is that

531
00:29:56,360 --> 00:29:58,040
what you're doing is a performance.

532
00:29:58,130 --> 00:30:02,900
It's a complete execution of your route.

533
00:30:03,110 --> 00:30:06,710
And as part of that, you also
have instances where you're
getting into your mind,

534
00:30:07,070 --> 00:30:09,980
where you are starting to doubt yourself,

535
00:30:09,981 --> 00:30:13,480
where you're just trying to actually
keep up with a high level of plays you're

536
00:30:13,490 --> 00:30:15,650
going through and what's actually showing.

537
00:30:15,651 --> 00:30:19,790
Along the bottom there is a heartbreak
graph of this is my heart going through a

538
00:30:19,791 --> 00:30:23,480
speed or in a spike of Sky Blazer, which
is the first game out of a speed run.

539
00:30:23,870 --> 00:30:27,020
And each of those instances
as you're going through,

540
00:30:27,260 --> 00:30:32,110
you can see that it gradually increases
and I'm just sitting down. Uh,

541
00:30:32,120 --> 00:30:35,960
this gets up to the point of moderate
exercise all while I'm in a chair just

542
00:30:35,961 --> 00:30:37,610
because I'm trying to

543
00:30:39,380 --> 00:30:43,550
rectify whatever's going on with the
screen and keep up my composure so that I

544
00:30:43,551 --> 00:30:45,080
can continue to perform optimally.

545
00:30:45,470 --> 00:30:49,940
And that's really another thing that
comes in with a conditioning trying to do

546
00:30:49,941 --> 00:30:52,430
these runs over and over
again. You identify, um,

547
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:56,280
here's my best strategy for
trying to calm down. Here's how I,

548
00:30:56,330 --> 00:31:01,330
I don't start to mess up simply because
I've put too much effort and thought

549
00:31:01,941 --> 00:31:06,270
into what's going on in the
screen. And it, you know, it's,

550
00:31:06,271 --> 00:31:09,680
it's a significant part of it when you're
going through and your heart's racing,

551
00:31:09,681 --> 00:31:11,840
you've got the adrenaline
pumping, all that. Um,

552
00:31:11,990 --> 00:31:14,540
but it's another really
fun part of a speed run.

553
00:31:15,620 --> 00:31:18,170
If you're able to get through the end,
you get a great release.

554
00:31:18,171 --> 00:31:23,060
It's just feels amazing.
Even if you drop a run right at the end,

555
00:31:23,390 --> 00:31:26,990
it can still feel really rewarding that
you've done so well in that, you know,

556
00:31:27,200 --> 00:31:28,040
I can get there again.

557
00:31:29,030 --> 00:31:33,500
So that covers the overall process here
is just a dump of a whole bunch of other

558
00:31:33,501 --> 00:31:37,550
topics that kind of fit into
these general parts of the phases.

559
00:31:37,820 --> 00:31:42,820
And really what I just wanted to show
here is that what I've talked about today

560
00:31:43,251 --> 00:31:44,600
is just scratching the surface.

561
00:31:44,930 --> 00:31:49,930
There's so much to optimization
to planning to proper
presentation of facts and

562
00:31:50,691 --> 00:31:54,560
details about games that really
there's something for everyone,

563
00:31:55,370 --> 00:31:58,550
even if you're not intent on trying to
go for a world record or anything like

564
00:31:58,551 --> 00:31:59,120
that.

565
00:31:59,120 --> 00:32:03,530
Like you can enjoy the routing process
coming up with a solution you can enjoy

566
00:32:03,531 --> 00:32:06,020
breaking apart a game,
finding out what makes it tick.

567
00:32:06,021 --> 00:32:10,190
And then exploiting those boundaries
and taking it to something further and

568
00:32:10,191 --> 00:32:14,030
still you can enjoy the practice
properties, improving yourself,

569
00:32:14,120 --> 00:32:17,000
coming up with a real product
that shows iterative improvement.

570
00:32:19,570 --> 00:32:23,380
So just to wrap up everything
related to the speed run process,

571
00:32:24,340 --> 00:32:27,370
really my main recommendation
is if you're getting started,

572
00:32:27,430 --> 00:32:30,520
even if you're already a conditioned
runner, really you want to try every step,

573
00:32:30,790 --> 00:32:34,390
try every bit of the phases a, even if
it's a game that's been done to death,

574
00:32:35,200 --> 00:32:36,790
just so you know what you enjoy.

575
00:32:36,820 --> 00:32:39,100
You can find all sorts of
things as well as improve,

576
00:32:39,200 --> 00:32:43,250
own understanding of what you're doing
and an and increase your enjoyment on top

577
00:32:43,251 --> 00:32:47,420
of that. And really to get the
most satisfaction about this,

578
00:32:47,840 --> 00:32:50,310
you want to be trying to push yourself,
um,

579
00:32:51,260 --> 00:32:54,380
don't necessarily just shoot
for a record because it's there.

580
00:32:54,680 --> 00:32:57,770
You really have to make it something that
is worth the effort that you put into

581
00:32:57,771 --> 00:33:00,320
it and something that you can
be proud of after the fact,

582
00:33:00,321 --> 00:33:02,240
beyond simply being the
top of the leaderboard.

583
00:33:02,840 --> 00:33:07,490
And also never forget that
you have a great opportunity
here to work with others.

584
00:33:07,520 --> 00:33:10,520
There's a very supportive community
all around who's willing to help,

585
00:33:10,521 --> 00:33:14,600
who's railing to support and just watch
your runs and something to be, uh,

586
00:33:15,350 --> 00:33:16,490
it feels great to be a part of.

587
00:33:16,880 --> 00:33:20,900
I want to end out with just a quick
discussion of where speed running actually

588
00:33:20,901 --> 00:33:22,880
is today. Uh, as a practice.

589
00:33:22,881 --> 00:33:26,680
It really is something that's only blown
up within the last 10 years or so. Uh,

590
00:33:26,690 --> 00:33:31,690
this particular chart is showing the
total amounts raised and the average

591
00:33:31,791 --> 00:33:36,380
viewership of what are known as the
Games done quick events and these are um,

592
00:33:36,710 --> 00:33:41,210
twice annual events that
are entirely speed focus,

593
00:33:41,211 --> 00:33:44,210
but there are benefiting in
particular charity at each event.

594
00:33:44,570 --> 00:33:48,470
And it's something that has really
kind of exploded in popularity,

595
00:33:48,471 --> 00:33:51,950
but it mimics the growth and attention
that's been given to speed runs as it's

596
00:33:51,951 --> 00:33:55,520
going through. If this graph
included this year is our a numbers,

597
00:33:55,521 --> 00:34:00,050
we'd also see the trend continuing
and it's one of the things that's most

598
00:34:00,051 --> 00:34:03,560
rewarding to me is that this is a hobby
with video games that's actually making

599
00:34:03,561 --> 00:34:05,180
a difference in the world.
Uh,

600
00:34:05,181 --> 00:34:09,260
we raised millions of dollars simply
because people enjoy watching it.

601
00:34:09,560 --> 00:34:14,420
And are particularly generous with, uh,
appreciating the skills going into it.

602
00:34:14,750 --> 00:34:18,830
And that's something that I honestly
find particularly wonderful and, um,

603
00:34:18,950 --> 00:34:22,430
is really rewarding beyond just
doing the speed runs itself.

604
00:34:22,850 --> 00:34:24,850
And that kind of wraps up everything.
Um,

605
00:34:25,070 --> 00:34:29,540
everything that we've talked about today
is a subset of some of the topics that

606
00:34:29,541 --> 00:34:33,570
I address in a book that I've been
working on for quite a long time now, uh,

607
00:34:33,620 --> 00:34:37,070
called speed run science and it tries to
break down every little bit of it. Um,

608
00:34:37,430 --> 00:34:40,790
in addition to discussing
the actual, uh, process,

609
00:34:40,970 --> 00:34:43,280
it goes into the philosophy,

610
00:34:43,400 --> 00:34:47,890
some of the history of how it
actually evolved and became
more important. And, um,

611
00:34:48,800 --> 00:34:53,180
finally it'll, it'll be available in,
in just a few weeks for preorder, um,

612
00:34:53,240 --> 00:34:56,450
probably, uh, arriving at people's
doors somewhere around February.

613
00:34:56,870 --> 00:35:01,070
A special thanks to carry fry who's
by illustrator for the book. Um,

614
00:35:01,100 --> 00:35:04,310
she provided many of the illustrations
that you're seeing throughout the slide,

615
00:35:04,340 --> 00:35:07,100
the slide deck as well. And um, uh,

616
00:35:07,130 --> 00:35:11,090
Tony [inaudible] who is my layout editor
for also produced a number of these

617
00:35:11,091 --> 00:35:12,090
graphics.
Uh,

618
00:35:12,100 --> 00:35:14,870
so a special thanks to them and the
rest of the fan game or crew for working

619
00:35:14,871 --> 00:35:18,110
with me and the production of this
book. With that, I'll close it out.

620
00:35:18,260 --> 00:35:21,160
You can reach out to me at any of those,
uh,

621
00:35:21,230 --> 00:35:23,990
social media or mail addresses
at the bottom and without,

622
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:25,250
I'm happy to take any questions.

623
00:35:27,620 --> 00:35:31,700
Uh, so I had some questions from people
who, uh, are in the office right now.

624
00:35:32,810 --> 00:35:37,110
First Save the, Oh, she's no. Uh,

625
00:35:37,680 --> 00:35:39,840
and second, uh, question from Iowa.

626
00:35:40,230 --> 00:35:43,260
What's the weirdest way you've
seen someone discover a trick?

627
00:35:44,080 --> 00:35:48,440
The weirdest way. Oh Man. So there's a,

628
00:35:48,441 --> 00:35:53,441
a particular game called dragon view
on Super Nintendo and this game,

629
00:35:55,900 --> 00:35:59,410
oh my, a friend of mine was working
on the speed run for this game.

630
00:35:59,440 --> 00:36:04,440
And at a particular part we discovered
a bug that had not prior been known.

631
00:36:04,870 --> 00:36:07,690
And the only way that you execute this
bug is simply that you haven't turned off

632
00:36:07,691 --> 00:36:08,320
the game.

633
00:36:08,320 --> 00:36:11,460
So after completing a certain
story element and then
you reach another story on

634
00:36:11,461 --> 00:36:13,360
it and you were expected to,
um,

635
00:36:13,390 --> 00:36:16,300
take a break somewhere in the middle and
you'd never would have seen this happen,

636
00:36:16,330 --> 00:36:18,400
but they have left some
dirty memory somewhere.

637
00:36:18,640 --> 00:36:23,140
And what actually ends up
happening is a huge, oh my,

638
00:36:23,141 --> 00:36:25,750
it's a very scary bug. Um, you basically,

639
00:36:25,810 --> 00:36:29,710
it allows you to overwrite the entire
memory contents, even going up,

640
00:36:29,740 --> 00:36:34,390
tries to start fiddling with RAAM. Um,
it does a lot of very interesting things,

641
00:36:34,391 --> 00:36:37,210
but this was discovered completely by
accident simply because they were trying

642
00:36:37,211 --> 00:36:39,370
to go through the game all in one sitting.

643
00:36:39,640 --> 00:36:44,260
And it actually turns out that
if you get the exact magic, um,

644
00:36:44,320 --> 00:36:45,160
conditions,

645
00:36:45,310 --> 00:36:50,050
you can make this work you into the ending
credits so that you can effectively,

646
00:36:50,350 --> 00:36:54,100
uh, you have a choice between if you
try to play it completely like this,

647
00:36:54,250 --> 00:36:58,390
you either completely crashed the
game, um, or you make it to the end.

648
00:36:58,720 --> 00:37:02,290
And it was just a really interesting find.
Um,

649
00:37:03,790 --> 00:37:04,540
uh,

650
00:37:04,540 --> 00:37:07,960
if you want details I can describe that
after the afterwards a little bit more

651
00:37:07,961 --> 00:37:09,520
about what's actually
going on under the hood.

652
00:37:10,390 --> 00:37:14,290
I think I saw a speed run for a life to
that word by saving and reloading the

653
00:37:14,291 --> 00:37:16,300
game such that when you reload the game,

654
00:37:16,301 --> 00:37:20,020
you're in a different position and the
video for those run where edited so you

655
00:37:20,021 --> 00:37:21,280
can only see the game play.

656
00:37:21,700 --> 00:37:24,850
Is that something that's a
specific category as you mentioned,

657
00:37:24,851 --> 00:37:25,720
the categories before?

658
00:37:26,050 --> 00:37:29,400
Uh, that would be a segmented
run for the most part,

659
00:37:29,670 --> 00:37:32,610
especially if they're removing
kind of the in between. Um,

660
00:37:33,330 --> 00:37:38,330
but it really is up to how the community
just fines what is challenging,

661
00:37:39,511 --> 00:37:42,270
what you're actually trying
to show. Um, and in this case,

662
00:37:42,271 --> 00:37:47,271
let's say that the half life to simply
by saving and quitting is what actually

663
00:37:47,431 --> 00:37:51,540
alters your, your position. Then
that's something that you can use in a,

664
00:37:52,080 --> 00:37:56,130
what's called a single segment run
and done in one sitting. But, um,

665
00:37:56,910 --> 00:37:59,430
most often for those kinds of things,
uh,

666
00:37:59,431 --> 00:38:02,130
it's going to be segmented
in that you do a block of it,

667
00:38:02,160 --> 00:38:04,650
tried to get it as optimal as possible.
In that Save,

668
00:38:04,651 --> 00:38:07,710
you're going to bring it up
again and do another one. Um,

669
00:38:07,860 --> 00:38:11,550
whether or not it's allowed or
expected is really up to the game,

670
00:38:11,610 --> 00:38:16,410
and it really depends on how the game
interacts with those saves. All right.

671
00:38:17,010 --> 00:38:19,410
Thank you so much for coming today.
It's my pleasure to talk

672
00:38:20,730 --> 00:38:25,380
[inaudible].
