1
00:00:05,800 --> 00:00:09,010
So if everyone could welcome Zach at bars,

2
00:00:09,400 --> 00:00:13,740
the creator of electronics,
Space Chem in minor or Gis,

3
00:00:13,750 --> 00:00:17,350
100 Schengen io and various other games.

4
00:00:20,360 --> 00:00:23,130
[inaudible]

5
00:00:23,640 --> 00:00:26,610
thank you. Okay, so the
first thing's first,

6
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:27,930
I want to share a secret with you guys.

7
00:00:28,260 --> 00:00:32,370
Just that I hate talks and they're
really boring and they're just God.

8
00:00:32,371 --> 00:00:35,250
I mean I've been to GDC so many years
that the game dollars conference and just

9
00:00:35,550 --> 00:00:38,280
sitting there and having somebody just
kind of talk at you with like they're

10
00:00:38,281 --> 00:00:41,520
preplanned deck of slides
and it's not very fun.

11
00:00:41,550 --> 00:00:43,860
So what I wanted to try doing this
time had it, mix it up a little bit,

12
00:00:43,861 --> 00:00:45,270
do some Q and a.
Uh,

13
00:00:45,271 --> 00:00:49,350
so you guys apparently asked a bunch of
questions and voted on the best ones and

14
00:00:49,380 --> 00:00:53,130
we don't actually know if the people
who asked the questions are here today.

15
00:00:54,240 --> 00:00:56,490
Raise your hand if you ask
a question on the website.

16
00:00:57,300 --> 00:01:01,140
Did any of you actually ask a question?
Okay.

17
00:01:01,170 --> 00:01:03,570
Did you ask all the questions?
Okay.

18
00:01:03,900 --> 00:01:06,660
So I guess you're going to have
to do the proxy. Okay. That,

19
00:01:06,661 --> 00:01:08,790
that kind of throws a wrench in that.
Okay.

20
00:01:08,820 --> 00:01:12,900
So I was going to have
people ask questions and
then answer them and ask them

21
00:01:12,901 --> 00:01:17,360
followup questions. But apparently
I can't do that. So, um, I dunno.

22
00:01:17,410 --> 00:01:19,860
I think it'd be cool to make
this. So it's not like I, I have,

23
00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:22,830
instead of repairing a giant slide deck,
I prepared a couple of smaller ones.

24
00:01:22,831 --> 00:01:23,760
I'm going to start with this one.

25
00:01:23,761 --> 00:01:25,920
But then from there I have a bunch
of things that are sort of answers to

26
00:01:25,921 --> 00:01:29,370
questions that might be asked by the
person who has a list of questions that

27
00:01:29,371 --> 00:01:33,660
they're going to ask. So we'll
see how this goes. Okay. So, um,

28
00:01:33,690 --> 00:01:37,020
how many people in the audience are
familiar with the Games that we've made?

29
00:01:37,440 --> 00:01:38,221
So that's sort of like,
okay,

30
00:01:38,221 --> 00:01:42,530
so are you flirt with all of them
or some of them are. Okay. So,

31
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:45,890
so when I was going to start with
is a, um, it's just sort of like a,

32
00:01:45,891 --> 00:01:49,020
a history of how we got here and the
games that we've made so that we all have

33
00:01:49,021 --> 00:01:53,610
like a shared context so we can
talk about games. So, um, so what,

34
00:01:53,611 --> 00:01:54,540
so I started making,

35
00:01:54,541 --> 00:01:57,450
making games when I went to college
and it just started off as a,

36
00:01:57,451 --> 00:02:00,720
as a fun thing and you get some,
some lovely games like this,

37
00:02:00,721 --> 00:02:04,650
which was the first game I guess I ever
made, which is for a game jam for, uh,

38
00:02:04,651 --> 00:02:05,021
for the,

39
00:02:05,021 --> 00:02:07,080
the Game Development Club where you're
supposed to make a game that your mother

40
00:02:07,081 --> 00:02:10,590
wouldn't play. And I won because I was
the only person who bothered to try it.

41
00:02:10,980 --> 00:02:12,540
So you can actually,

42
00:02:12,541 --> 00:02:15,660
this is the probably the earliest
game that I've made that you can still

43
00:02:15,661 --> 00:02:19,320
download. Like if you go to like our
secret old website on the Internet and a,

44
00:02:19,321 --> 00:02:22,110
but it's really bad and it's terrible.
Uh,

45
00:02:22,111 --> 00:02:24,480
another weird game that I made in
college is again, common fit of Frag,

46
00:02:24,481 --> 00:02:28,380
which was terrible and I really had no
idea how to do any of the things that are

47
00:02:28,381 --> 00:02:32,190
involved in making this happen from a
technical standpoint. But, uh, it, it,

48
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:35,600
as you may know, went on to start
some big stuff years later, uh,

49
00:02:36,060 --> 00:02:39,780
through some other stuff
we'll got through. It was
a terrible game though. Um,

50
00:02:40,500 --> 00:02:43,290
so there's, there's a game called
manufacturer that I made also terrible,

51
00:02:43,320 --> 00:02:47,310
this sort of a trend here, um, in
which you, you would build factories.

52
00:02:47,311 --> 00:02:50,400
And this was directly inspired by the
show, how it's made, where, you know,

53
00:02:50,401 --> 00:02:53,550
it was back when I was less jaded about
making games and then I, you know,

54
00:02:53,870 --> 00:02:57,180
I saw how it's made on TV and it was like,
wow, this is incredible. Like this is,

55
00:02:57,420 --> 00:02:59,500
this is, you know, like
we're seeing how are made.

56
00:02:59,500 --> 00:03:01,390
It would be so cool not to
like to make those things,

57
00:03:01,391 --> 00:03:04,600
but to make a factory that makes things
like that. And, and that this game,

58
00:03:04,730 --> 00:03:07,330
it doesn't really look like it,
but was sort of trying to get at that the,

59
00:03:07,331 --> 00:03:07,901
the downside,

60
00:03:07,901 --> 00:03:10,540
the biggest downside is probably that
you had to program in the Lula completely

61
00:03:10,541 --> 00:03:14,930
unnecessarily. And that's like a god
awful experience. So that's that.

62
00:03:14,931 --> 00:03:17,740
That was something, um, here's
a game called Rick engineer,

63
00:03:17,741 --> 00:03:22,540
which was the like super credi kind of
exploration into a game about electrical

64
00:03:22,541 --> 00:03:24,920
engineering, mechanics and
reverse engineering. Um,

65
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:28,750
the idea that it was going to get a point.
So there are these,

66
00:03:28,751 --> 00:03:33,200
these test points where you could,
I mean, you can't even look at you,

67
00:03:33,201 --> 00:03:36,510
you're there. Like they're automatically
tagged. This is a terrible interface. Um,

68
00:03:37,480 --> 00:03:41,200
you can sort of interact with the circuits
at various tests points and you can

69
00:03:41,201 --> 00:03:45,790
kind of reverse engineer the circuit and
tried to unlock the lock. And this was,

70
00:03:46,120 --> 00:03:47,980
I mean,
if you're familiar with our earlier games,

71
00:03:47,981 --> 00:03:49,700
this is kind of the beginning of,
you know,

72
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:53,560
an idea that reoccurs a lot of games
about electrical engineering. Um,

73
00:03:53,860 --> 00:03:57,280
this was probably like the first kind
of puzzle game that I tried to make.

74
00:03:57,281 --> 00:04:01,360
It was really terrible, but
it's about, uh, like sequential
transformation of data.

75
00:04:01,720 --> 00:04:06,130
The idea of being that like there's
certain can you can't say that. Okay.

76
00:04:06,160 --> 00:04:08,950
So there's that whole on the left
side where like data pulses come in,

77
00:04:08,951 --> 00:04:11,800
which you're one of them different
colors and that you can apply like

78
00:04:11,801 --> 00:04:14,440
transformations, like filtering
them by color and redirecting them.

79
00:04:14,441 --> 00:04:19,250
And it's a horrible game. But again, kind
of gets us some, some early ideas. Um,

80
00:04:19,480 --> 00:04:24,370
there's again fun silicon foundry
which is about, uh, you, you said you,

81
00:04:24,371 --> 00:04:25,690
you build chips,

82
00:04:25,720 --> 00:04:28,390
you build ships by assembling a little
parts that I don't think I really have

83
00:04:28,391 --> 00:04:31,240
any pictures of it but it was sort of
like a little tetris pieces that would fit

84
00:04:31,241 --> 00:04:36,130
together and they had different like input
and output requirements and you would

85
00:04:36,131 --> 00:04:39,670
use it to satisfy like very abstracted
ideas of these different products you

86
00:04:39,671 --> 00:04:40,770
could build.
And over the course of the,

87
00:04:40,771 --> 00:04:43,840
and there are probably like 30 different
products that you built that are like

88
00:04:43,841 --> 00:04:46,560
very simple simplifications of,

89
00:04:46,570 --> 00:04:49,270
of electrical circuits that your
products and stuff like that.

90
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:50,950
And at this point it
should be kind of obvious,

91
00:04:50,951 --> 00:04:53,710
like sort of what my background is is
that when I went to college it was for

92
00:04:53,711 --> 00:04:57,200
computer science, computer engineering
and like all of these things that,

93
00:04:57,270 --> 00:04:58,870
these ideas that I,
I'd sort of,

94
00:04:59,100 --> 00:05:02,590
I known that they existed
before as somebody who used
computers and was fond of

95
00:05:02,591 --> 00:05:03,101
computers.

96
00:05:03,101 --> 00:05:05,890
But starting to see like sort of how
these things work behind the scenes.

97
00:05:06,070 --> 00:05:07,360
It all starts coming out.

98
00:05:07,570 --> 00:05:10,150
Not really in my classwork because there
was nothing special going on there.

99
00:05:10,151 --> 00:05:14,050
But in a,
in these games that I'm building and uh,

100
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:16,710
there's some sort of other diversions
into other areas that are more gamey.

101
00:05:16,760 --> 00:05:21,000
This is a game we made called Tex Mex
where you, uh, you ran around on a uh,

102
00:05:21,070 --> 00:05:23,880
pat that's like a giant sheet
of carpet with like, uh,

103
00:05:23,940 --> 00:05:27,340
like screen door material underneath
of it and it's like a really cruddy,

104
00:05:27,370 --> 00:05:28,810
a pressure sensitive pads.

105
00:05:28,811 --> 00:05:31,510
So we knew where you were standing and
then we took a hatch we mode and this is

106
00:05:31,511 --> 00:05:31,841
right when the,

107
00:05:31,841 --> 00:05:34,750
we came out and people were starting
to like kind of analyze the Bluetooth

108
00:05:34,751 --> 00:05:36,490
protocol and figuring
out how to hack that.

109
00:05:36,730 --> 00:05:38,800
I don't know if anybody was messing
around with that stuff when it happened,

110
00:05:38,801 --> 00:05:40,730
but it was like, it was, it was
cool. It was really cool and I,

111
00:05:40,731 --> 00:05:43,390
and for the first time in my life had
like the technological skills to actually

112
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:44,740
kind of do some of that stuff.

113
00:05:44,741 --> 00:05:47,350
And so we took a we moat and took all
the guts out and jammed it into like a

114
00:05:47,351 --> 00:05:49,960
piece of metal. So it was kind of like
a, like a lightsaber kind of thing.

115
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:53,350
And then made a game that
was like inspired by Gundam
kind of and like visually

116
00:05:53,351 --> 00:05:56,370
kind of looked like it and you would
like run around and attack and,

117
00:05:56,390 --> 00:05:58,870
and do stuff. And it's Sorta it, it's
like the connect before the connectors,

118
00:05:58,910 --> 00:06:03,400
the thing. And it was
probably about as popular. So,

119
00:06:03,410 --> 00:06:05,850
um, uh, yeah, so the,

120
00:06:05,851 --> 00:06:09,500
the last game that I made in college was
as I was coming out to Seattle to work

121
00:06:09,501 --> 00:06:11,570
at Microsoft was a game
called Rick engineer too.

122
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:16,560
And I would say this is probably the
first like modern electronics game. Uh,

123
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:20,210
this was the first one that actually
people really played to any degree on the

124
00:06:20,211 --> 00:06:23,260
Internet. Uh, it got on Hakodate
so I submitted it to hacker Dan.

125
00:06:23,270 --> 00:06:24,470
This was back in like really very,

126
00:06:24,471 --> 00:06:28,320
very few people were following what we
were up to or what I was up to. And, um,

127
00:06:28,480 --> 00:06:31,580
we got the link, I sent it to hack a damn
like you guys, like electrical stuff.

128
00:06:31,581 --> 00:06:34,670
Here's the game that's about electrical
reverse engineering and they posted it

129
00:06:34,820 --> 00:06:37,260
and this was back in 2008.
And,

130
00:06:37,270 --> 00:06:40,010
and that was like the first time that
anything I'd ever made got in front of a

131
00:06:40,011 --> 00:06:43,640
bunch of people and it was awesome and
a bunch of people came and played it and

132
00:06:43,641 --> 00:06:46,400
that, that brought a lot of people to
my website and kept them coming back.

133
00:06:46,401 --> 00:06:47,780
And that was back in like the blog era.

134
00:06:47,781 --> 00:06:51,170
So that was like the way to do it I guess.
And uh,

135
00:06:51,171 --> 00:06:54,380
and so this is a refined can war game,
your version of,

136
00:06:54,381 --> 00:06:58,100
of the wreck engineer nasty game.
You saw it before and uh,

137
00:06:58,310 --> 00:07:01,460
and it has like really terrible like
full motion video storytelling class.

138
00:07:01,510 --> 00:07:04,130
I should have brought more of that
because it's there. It's like me,

139
00:07:04,131 --> 00:07:05,570
me just straight out of college,

140
00:07:05,571 --> 00:07:08,360
like dressed up with like whatever I could
find that looks like military surplus

141
00:07:08,361 --> 00:07:12,260
clothing, like running around making
my, my now wife fill me as, I'm like,

142
00:07:12,261 --> 00:07:15,770
we did like a sequence where I'm like
running through a field and like have to

143
00:07:15,771 --> 00:07:18,440
like go disarm the bomb and like that's
all in there and it's adorable and

144
00:07:18,441 --> 00:07:21,500
terrible. And Yeah. Uh, so,

145
00:07:21,501 --> 00:07:23,470
so that sort of was the end of,

146
00:07:23,471 --> 00:07:25,660
of the colleges have games and
got into the Microsoft here.

147
00:07:25,661 --> 00:07:27,980
It's where I didn't actually
make games at Microsoft,

148
00:07:27,981 --> 00:07:31,280
but I made games at night while I worked
at Microsoft and worked on office.

149
00:07:31,281 --> 00:07:34,330
I worked on Vizio for
for three years and uh,

150
00:07:34,420 --> 00:07:38,650
it was like the opposite of making games
when I, I worked briefly, I didn't, I,

151
00:07:38,870 --> 00:07:39,531
when I was in college,

152
00:07:39,531 --> 00:07:42,620
I did an internship at a studio
called breakaway games and they made,

153
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:48,560
it was like 50% expansion packs to like
eat like ea games and stuff and 50%,

154
00:07:48,670 --> 00:07:52,430
uh, like real, like, um, like
serious games, I guess like game.

155
00:07:52,430 --> 00:07:56,180
They made a game that was
like a simulation of like a
military hospital and like

156
00:07:56,181 --> 00:07:59,120
one of their infamous bugs
is that patients would die
and then just get up and

157
00:07:59,121 --> 00:08:02,480
start walking around anyway and stuff.
So they were like 50% serious,

158
00:08:02,481 --> 00:08:04,640
50% expansions and I worked there.
I,

159
00:08:04,910 --> 00:08:08,810
I briefly intern there during the summer
when you're and worked on a game that

160
00:08:08,811 --> 00:08:11,780
was, it was like an
adventure game for kids like,

161
00:08:11,781 --> 00:08:15,170
but it was made for the Middle Eastern
market and it was done by like a bunch of

162
00:08:15,171 --> 00:08:18,090
like American businessmen who wanted
to promote American values of Bron.

163
00:08:18,260 --> 00:08:22,010
So it's like a really weird introduction
to the games industry. And uh,

164
00:08:22,011 --> 00:08:24,140
and so after like a summary of
that, I'm just like, you know what,

165
00:08:24,141 --> 00:08:25,700
I don't really like games that much.

166
00:08:25,940 --> 00:08:29,360
Like I had been designing games while I
was in college and then I go get a real

167
00:08:29,361 --> 00:08:31,700
game design job and I'm just
like writing c plus plus,

168
00:08:31,701 --> 00:08:34,940
which I'm not good at and still I'm
not good at. And it's just like, wow,

169
00:08:34,941 --> 00:08:36,590
this is this.
I could just program anything.

170
00:08:36,591 --> 00:08:39,890
And it would probably be about as fun. And
on that logic, I went to work on Vizio.

171
00:08:40,160 --> 00:08:44,960
Uh, so, which was I guess not
true. So when I was there,
I worked on a lot of games.

172
00:08:44,990 --> 00:08:47,810
Like probably right away I probably
started working on stuff for fun at night.

173
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:50,390
And that's how I swear making Flash Games.

174
00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:55,500
So downloadable games were a thing,
I guess they still are. But, uh,

175
00:08:55,501 --> 00:08:58,050
this was right when, when flash
games were really, really taking off,

176
00:08:58,500 --> 00:09:00,480
as exemplified by the fact
that when I was in college,

177
00:09:00,481 --> 00:09:03,180
I used to spend a lot of time
playing flash games in class.

178
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:05,820
And so as that was taken, I was like,
Oh, I'm gonna make some flash games.

179
00:09:05,821 --> 00:09:07,500
So you get the bureau
of Steam Engineering,

180
00:09:07,501 --> 00:09:11,430
which is a game about a seem engineering
in a context that's not really real

181
00:09:11,431 --> 00:09:14,010
estate engineering, but in a,
in a context that didn't exist,

182
00:09:14,011 --> 00:09:15,480
which is like a steam powered civil war,

183
00:09:15,540 --> 00:09:18,080
which does the theme that comes up again.
Uh,

184
00:09:18,210 --> 00:09:20,470
you get a game called the critics
of what chemical engineering, uh,

185
00:09:20,520 --> 00:09:24,270
which is a game about alchemy where
you program a little arms to move atoms

186
00:09:24,271 --> 00:09:28,600
around. This is both like the,
the it followup I guess, to,

187
00:09:28,601 --> 00:09:29,880
to manufactory.
Like what if,

188
00:09:29,881 --> 00:09:33,390
what if you could build a factory without
having to write Lula? That's this game.

189
00:09:33,640 --> 00:09:38,430
Um, and then this later be obviously
become spacecom. Um, you can door,

190
00:09:38,520 --> 00:09:42,480
which is something, uh, so, you know, so,

191
00:09:42,490 --> 00:09:45,930
so this is a game about
building integrated circuits,
kind of, and it's again,

192
00:09:45,931 --> 00:09:48,150
like stuff I learned in college
but didn't learn in college.

193
00:09:48,151 --> 00:09:50,310
So this is not how real
integrated circuits work,

194
00:09:50,311 --> 00:09:54,130
but it's kind of evocative of it. So that
was something, oh, you asked to see my,

195
00:09:54,131 --> 00:09:57,120
my love of like, uh, like,
like Soviet nostalgia stuff,

196
00:09:57,121 --> 00:10:00,750
kind of leaking through hearing. Um, uh,

197
00:10:00,990 --> 00:10:04,500
I make a game called and fit a minor,
so my wife goes away,

198
00:10:04,501 --> 00:10:07,740
back home to the east coast for the
weekend, and when she comes back,

199
00:10:07,741 --> 00:10:11,430
I've made the beginnings of Infinera
minor. And, uh, and that's a story that's,

200
00:10:11,431 --> 00:10:12,870
that's been a big thing in my life.
Uh,

201
00:10:12,871 --> 00:10:17,310
so when I really have to get into the
infinite later story I guess, but, um,

202
00:10:18,030 --> 00:10:20,060
so I made, I made this game, uh,

203
00:10:20,190 --> 00:10:23,430
for me it was a sequel to Infinera frag
and kind of a way to explore like, oh,

204
00:10:23,431 --> 00:10:25,580
what if we took those really terrible,
you know,

205
00:10:25,620 --> 00:10:28,980
that block engine that could only render
like 30 blocks without like becoming a

206
00:10:28,981 --> 00:10:32,790
performance and made it so we could render
an entire world out of blocks and a,

207
00:10:32,791 --> 00:10:35,640
and that was Infinera minor and
accidentally started some other games,

208
00:10:35,641 --> 00:10:36,960
genres and stuff.
We'll get into that later.

209
00:10:37,860 --> 00:10:41,800
I'm sure somebody will have a
question about that. Um, uh,

210
00:10:41,850 --> 00:10:43,050
then I made a game called space cab.

211
00:10:43,140 --> 00:10:46,890
So this was our first commercial game
and I guess the first game where we're me

212
00:10:46,891 --> 00:10:48,780
became an actual, we, um,

213
00:10:48,810 --> 00:10:52,770
there were like six or eight people who
sit through some means worked on this

214
00:10:52,771 --> 00:10:54,600
game. And this was right when, after,

215
00:10:54,601 --> 00:10:58,320
I guess I'd say this is like my posts
braid game because braid came out and

216
00:10:58,321 --> 00:11:01,320
castle crashers and that's like,
Holy Shit. Like you can be a nobody,

217
00:11:01,321 --> 00:11:04,800
you can be not backed by a publisher
and make a ton of money and actually saw

218
00:11:04,801 --> 00:11:06,030
your game.
And,

219
00:11:06,031 --> 00:11:08,880
and that was inspirational because before
that I thought I'd have to give away

220
00:11:08,881 --> 00:11:10,530
my games. Right. And we
look in a fit of minor,

221
00:11:10,590 --> 00:11:12,260
like how could you ever
sell Infinera minor?

222
00:11:12,270 --> 00:11:16,470
Like how could you sell a game like
that would never make money, right.

223
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:19,740
So this is really where
I was at at this time.

224
00:11:19,741 --> 00:11:23,180
And obviously after seeing like space
Kim is also a post Minecraft game and the

225
00:11:23,181 --> 00:11:24,330
seeing that like,
wow you can,

226
00:11:24,510 --> 00:11:28,330
you can make a game and somebody
can make money off of it. And,

227
00:11:28,680 --> 00:11:33,660
and so so so we made, we made space
cam and we thought, you know, God,

228
00:11:33,661 --> 00:11:36,810
I mean I spent like five grand
of my own money, like as a,

229
00:11:36,811 --> 00:11:40,440
as an advanced to our artists in the
Philippines and everybody else was just

230
00:11:40,441 --> 00:11:43,020
working on profit sharing.
Cause I was like, okay,

231
00:11:43,050 --> 00:11:46,080
this game we could probably make
like 10 grand. Right. And I was like,

232
00:11:46,081 --> 00:11:48,300
but like if we happen to
make like a hundred grand,

233
00:11:48,301 --> 00:11:51,870
like I'll quit my job and make games.
And so that just kind of instantly,

234
00:11:51,871 --> 00:11:54,160
and that happened, like we made
the, I'm just like, okay, well no,

235
00:11:54,161 --> 00:11:55,800
I'm not quitting my job.
Like that's not,

236
00:11:55,820 --> 00:11:58,360
that's not enough money to sustain
like a bunch of people working.

237
00:11:58,570 --> 00:12:02,980
We make it to three grand then or three.
I knew that 300 grand, like then, then,

238
00:12:03,010 --> 00:12:05,260
then I'll quit my job and we
did. And it was like, Oh God,

239
00:12:05,261 --> 00:12:07,810
I guess we have to do this now.
So I was actually, I was the,

240
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:11,830
so the core original electronics
is me and my friend Keith.

241
00:12:11,831 --> 00:12:14,260
And so Keith went to Rpi with me.
He actually was there,

242
00:12:14,261 --> 00:12:15,910
like when I was designing and fit of Frag,

243
00:12:15,970 --> 00:12:18,460
it was his idea that in
order to build a block,

244
00:12:18,461 --> 00:12:21,760
I'll have another block that you pointed
shoot at it. So I'm apparently act too.

245
00:12:21,790 --> 00:12:25,880
So yeah, it's like, that's, that's like
I've been working with him for another,

246
00:12:26,210 --> 00:12:29,140
with working with him on
stuff for a while. And, uh,

247
00:12:29,141 --> 00:12:31,240
and so we were the first two
people to do Zach tronics.

248
00:12:31,241 --> 00:12:36,160
We had like a tiny little office and he
actually quit Microsoft like a week or

249
00:12:36,161 --> 00:12:40,000
two before me. That's how more dedicated
he was than me I guess. And uh,

250
00:12:40,060 --> 00:12:44,920
and this is what started the, into years.
So our first game was ironclad tactics,

251
00:12:45,050 --> 00:12:48,400
uh, which is kind of alive
because ironclad tactics
actually came out two years

252
00:12:48,401 --> 00:12:50,590
after we started doing
sex tronics fulltime.

253
00:12:50,770 --> 00:12:54,730
And during a period during
which we actually made a
bunch of educational games,

254
00:12:54,731 --> 00:12:56,700
which I'll show you in a second, uh, we,

255
00:12:56,701 --> 00:12:59,110
we thought this was going to
be like the hottest shit ever.

256
00:12:59,111 --> 00:13:00,850
And if space Kim did this well,

257
00:13:00,910 --> 00:13:03,790
like clearly ironclad tactics was
going to do this well because all the

258
00:13:03,791 --> 00:13:06,580
complaints we heard about space camera
that like it didn't look good and it was

259
00:13:06,581 --> 00:13:08,950
too hard. This game was
easier, it looks better.

260
00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:12,160
And instead of selling this well and
instead of selling this will IX face him,

261
00:13:12,180 --> 00:13:15,760
it's still like this fall. So, so
that was a bit of like a, a thing.

262
00:13:15,761 --> 00:13:19,210
We can get into that later too. If you
need to. But during that time, we also,

263
00:13:19,211 --> 00:13:20,680
the thing,
the reason I'm still like,

264
00:13:20,681 --> 00:13:23,530
I'm here today and talking about making
games and kept doing it after us because

265
00:13:23,531 --> 00:13:27,880
while we were doing in cloud tactics and
perhaps wondering some of our future on

266
00:13:27,881 --> 00:13:29,320
that, we, um,

267
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:32,680
we made some educational games for a
company called amplify who was owned by

268
00:13:32,681 --> 00:13:36,400
News Corp inexplicably.
It's felt like a zillion dollars building,

269
00:13:36,401 --> 00:13:40,330
a tablet based curriculum that like
literally caught on fire. And uh,

270
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:44,710
and so they will only once, and it
might've been a power supply or something,

271
00:13:44,711 --> 00:13:49,090
I don't know. So, um, so, so we
made a game about starch metabolism,

272
00:13:49,270 --> 00:13:53,080
which is pretty cool for game and
let's starch metabolism. Um, they're,

273
00:13:53,081 --> 00:13:55,270
they're all tablet games,
so it's, it's like pinball.

274
00:13:55,300 --> 00:13:57,790
Acceptive pinball wasn't pinball
and you had a bunch of pinballs.

275
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,730
And so you flick the little particles
around and like, you know, like you,

276
00:14:00,770 --> 00:14:03,350
you can push the button
to pump the, uh, like the,

277
00:14:03,351 --> 00:14:05,950
the lungs and it brings in a new set of
air and then you can just take all the

278
00:14:05,951 --> 00:14:06,820
oxygen out.
And I'm like,

279
00:14:06,830 --> 00:14:09,510
swipe it into the one stream and said it
was pretty cool but it's terrible. Um,

280
00:14:10,150 --> 00:14:13,260
the probably the best educational
game we, it was have a tactics, a,

281
00:14:13,390 --> 00:14:17,890
a cooperative like eating
other creatures simulator.

282
00:14:17,891 --> 00:14:18,491
It's Kinda weird.

283
00:14:18,491 --> 00:14:21,610
It's matched three and like the animals
like have to line up to be eaten by the

284
00:14:21,611 --> 00:14:22,960
next one up in the food pyramid.

285
00:14:23,140 --> 00:14:26,890
But it's really cool because it represents
a haven't done how have habitats

286
00:14:26,891 --> 00:14:29,620
where I can't send the word habitat
without saying have a tactics now,

287
00:14:29,621 --> 00:14:34,210
which is it makes it hard to
be taken seriously. Um, so uh,

288
00:14:34,211 --> 00:14:35,410
this is a game called factor,

289
00:14:35,411 --> 00:14:38,200
which is when like Twitter and stuff
we're taking off and like the weird,

290
00:14:38,201 --> 00:14:39,860
like we're going to take
out vowels in our name.

291
00:14:39,861 --> 00:14:42,520
So that was all my idea of the
factor and maybe not, I don't even,

292
00:14:42,790 --> 00:14:45,340
I love it regardless.
And it's a game where you,

293
00:14:45,490 --> 00:14:47,560
you are the ship and you
move your finger around,

294
00:14:47,570 --> 00:14:50,470
it follows the ship and you pick up
these numbers to take on the identity of

295
00:14:50,471 --> 00:14:51,170
these prime numbers,

296
00:14:51,170 --> 00:14:53,540
which allow you to then slice up
numbers that are divisible by it.

297
00:14:54,020 --> 00:14:58,160
It's pretty cool for a math
game. Um, uh, so after,

298
00:14:58,161 --> 00:15:01,810
after the fallout of ironclad tactics
and realizing like, oh dear God, this,

299
00:15:01,811 --> 00:15:04,160
but this game was not going to make as
much money as we were hoping was going to,

300
00:15:04,270 --> 00:15:07,520
we, we had to radically downsize and we
had to sort of think about like what the

301
00:15:07,521 --> 00:15:11,970
hell are we doing? Right? Like we can't,
we thought that going into the Indy,

302
00:15:11,971 --> 00:15:15,470
the Indy times that you could just make
any game and as long as it was fun,

303
00:15:15,471 --> 00:15:17,530
people would find your game and
play it and you make lots of money.

304
00:15:17,531 --> 00:15:18,920
It'd be great cause that's
what happened was face cam.

305
00:15:19,040 --> 00:15:21,170
It turns out we accidentally did
something right. Let's face Kim,

306
00:15:21,171 --> 00:15:24,200
I guess I really don't even like people
claim to know what goes on in the games

307
00:15:24,230 --> 00:15:27,740
industry. I think they're all liars or
they just are confused or they did too.

308
00:15:27,741 --> 00:15:31,130
Well, you know, we were sort of blessed
by doing well enough to still be around,

309
00:15:31,131 --> 00:15:34,610
but not well enough that we can't just
like accidentally coast on our laurels

310
00:15:34,611 --> 00:15:39,130
that we have to, we're always just
kind of getting by and uh, and so that,

311
00:15:39,131 --> 00:15:43,440
that kind of thinking is what led to
Infinera factory. Um, God, there was,

312
00:15:43,441 --> 00:15:46,670
so there was a long spirit period of
time in which I made and Finna minor and

313
00:15:46,671 --> 00:15:49,820
then kind of felt bad about it and felt
like I couldn't really make another game

314
00:15:49,821 --> 00:15:52,910
like that. Or It'd be weird to make a
block game and Infinera factors like,

315
00:15:52,911 --> 00:15:56,570
you know what? No, like we
can make any games we want
about blocks. Like who cares?

316
00:15:56,840 --> 00:15:59,000
Uh, it'd be cool to make a game
that's kind of like space can,

317
00:15:59,001 --> 00:16:01,550
but in three d with blocks and you built
stuff like factories and like, I mean,

318
00:16:01,551 --> 00:16:04,490
obviously you can see the repeating
themes and all of these games and that's

319
00:16:04,491 --> 00:16:08,870
what in Finna factory and it did well.
Right? And so we went from thinking,

320
00:16:09,280 --> 00:16:10,113
um,

321
00:16:10,460 --> 00:16:13,370
like we'll never make a game that will
ever do as well as space camp ever again.

322
00:16:13,390 --> 00:16:16,610
I, I legitimately believe that like that's
based on was just an element of timing

323
00:16:16,611 --> 00:16:19,580
and that we'd never make a game like
that again and it would just never do as

324
00:16:19,581 --> 00:16:24,050
well in Finna factor did better than
space cow soso apparently that's not true.

325
00:16:24,080 --> 00:16:27,170
So I'm so that was sort of
a cool optimistic thing.

326
00:16:27,400 --> 00:16:31,430
Also made a game called ts 100 which
almost didn't make um, I caught,

327
00:16:31,431 --> 00:16:34,220
I wanted to stop making this game
so many times because it's terrible.

328
00:16:34,221 --> 00:16:37,460
I was like no one is going to play this.
I I took it with me on my laptop.

329
00:16:37,461 --> 00:16:40,710
Did you see one year and I had the
little printed out manual and I wanted to

330
00:16:40,711 --> 00:16:43,370
like get some people to play test it and
I couldn't even bring myself to put it

331
00:16:43,371 --> 00:16:45,920
in front of anybody to let them
play test it cause I'm just like no,

332
00:16:45,921 --> 00:16:47,030
like this game is awful.

333
00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:49,850
And we brought down the manual to show
somebody and they're just like, oh my God,

334
00:16:49,851 --> 00:16:52,750
this is amazing. I'm
just like, really? So so,

335
00:16:53,340 --> 00:16:56,400
so we kept working on it and we shipped
it and it was really just like a,

336
00:16:56,401 --> 00:16:58,700
this was like a little side
project that was a, um,

337
00:17:00,050 --> 00:17:02,930
I had started working on this other game
cause I was born and wanted to make a

338
00:17:02,931 --> 00:17:04,340
different game while working on this too.

339
00:17:04,340 --> 00:17:06,440
And it was going to be this big adventure
game with a bunch of different puzzles

340
00:17:06,441 --> 00:17:08,030
in it. And that was not
clearly not going to happen.

341
00:17:08,060 --> 00:17:10,730
You can't make two games at
once. So it's very hard. Um,

342
00:17:11,420 --> 00:17:14,750
and ctis was just like a tiny little
portion of that game spun out into its own

343
00:17:14,751 --> 00:17:15,920
little thing and,

344
00:17:15,921 --> 00:17:18,320
and we shipped it and it actually did
really well and it did better than

345
00:17:18,321 --> 00:17:21,500
ironclad tactics, like, right.
Like that's crazy. Like,

346
00:17:21,501 --> 00:17:25,580
so clearly we don't understand how
games work at all, but we're successful.

347
00:17:25,640 --> 00:17:29,960
The sort of irony here, I guess. Is that,
what's the next slide? Okay. Yeah. So, um,

348
00:17:30,020 --> 00:17:33,140
the irony here is that these games did
well and I'd thought that nothing could

349
00:17:33,141 --> 00:17:33,930
ever do as well as space.

350
00:17:33,930 --> 00:17:37,820
Kim and I learned that these games did
well while I was working at valve after

351
00:17:37,821 --> 00:17:40,370
having shutdowns electronics
because I was tired of failing.

352
00:17:40,760 --> 00:17:44,300
And so that was sort of a weird thing.
And so VR was happening.

353
00:17:44,301 --> 00:17:47,420
I felt kind of bad cause like none of
our games really did well and Vr was

354
00:17:47,421 --> 00:17:49,290
happening and there was no
way we could make a VR game.

355
00:17:49,291 --> 00:17:51,660
And it seemed like it was
important to work on it. And, uh,

356
00:17:51,661 --> 00:17:55,230
and so I found myself at valve
and I worked on VR stuff there.

357
00:17:55,260 --> 00:17:57,270
There's a question for
that. We'll get there. Um,

358
00:17:57,480 --> 00:18:01,500
and then seemingly out of the
blue, uh, we, we sold Zach tronics.

359
00:18:01,560 --> 00:18:04,910
So electronics is not owned
by me anymore. Thank God. Um,

360
00:18:04,980 --> 00:18:06,960
that was the worst part of running
an indie studio. It turns out,

361
00:18:06,961 --> 00:18:09,990
is owning it and having to do the
business stuff. I'm not a business person.

362
00:18:09,991 --> 00:18:14,730
I'm not that clever or whatever it takes
to do business. And, uh, maybe not clever.

363
00:18:14,731 --> 00:18:18,540
I don't know. Um, uh, so, so
needless to say, we actually,

364
00:18:18,541 --> 00:18:21,570
we sold electronics and we now worked
for like a publisher distributor who's

365
00:18:21,571 --> 00:18:24,360
also electronics. And it's great because
it allowed us to make Shinjin io,

366
00:18:24,510 --> 00:18:26,310
which is awesome. Right? I mean this is,

367
00:18:26,311 --> 00:18:28,560
this is perhaps like the
mosaic tronics he game yet.

368
00:18:28,770 --> 00:18:32,310
And we made it while technically not
being indie, which is really exciting. Um,

369
00:18:33,010 --> 00:18:35,220
because I didn't have to do the business
stuff and I didn't have to do our taxes.

370
00:18:35,400 --> 00:18:38,870
So these are serious problems
that I had to deal with. Uh,

371
00:18:39,960 --> 00:18:40,501
and uh,

372
00:18:40,501 --> 00:18:43,170
yeah and so I suspect more of you are
familiar with [inaudible] out cause that's

373
00:18:43,171 --> 00:18:47,070
like the new flashy one and a and stuff.
And that is the end of that.

374
00:18:47,071 --> 00:18:49,720
So that sort of catches up
to where we are now that um,

375
00:18:50,070 --> 00:18:55,070
we released this game like Decemberish
it came out of early access and,

376
00:18:55,350 --> 00:18:57,270
and that's, that's,
that's the history so far.

377
00:18:57,450 --> 00:18:59,010
Does anybody have any
questions about this part?

378
00:18:59,011 --> 00:19:02,940
Just about anything you saw or any other
things I didn't mention or let me thing.

379
00:19:03,810 --> 00:19:07,200
Okay. So we're going to take a couple of
questions from the door and open it up.

380
00:19:07,560 --> 00:19:09,660
Okay.
The first question was,

381
00:19:09,900 --> 00:19:12,450
what has been the most surprising or
unexpected thing that you've seen him play

382
00:19:12,460 --> 00:19:15,240
or do with one of your games? Oh,
okay. Oh, what you want to come back?

383
00:19:15,360 --> 00:19:17,820
So I actually have a whole another
presentation that shows off stuff,

384
00:19:17,821 --> 00:19:21,270
but it might be better to like, okay.
Not just blast through more slides.

385
00:19:21,271 --> 00:19:24,150
I was trying not to make us a slideshow,
but apparently we're,

386
00:19:24,151 --> 00:19:25,620
we run in that that route.
Yeah.

387
00:19:25,740 --> 00:19:28,710
How long do you spend designing the
court in logic of the game compared to

388
00:19:28,711 --> 00:19:31,170
coming up with puzzles
for, oh, that's fine.

389
00:19:31,740 --> 00:19:35,740
I definitely haven't heard
that question before now and,

390
00:19:35,760 --> 00:19:37,560
but when you send it to me,
that was, that didn't work.

391
00:19:37,590 --> 00:19:41,940
That was a joke that when
you're going, so, um,

392
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:46,050
what is this? This is not okay.
We're going to open this in here. Um,

393
00:19:46,350 --> 00:19:50,130
so, so I Shinjin io is, is he an
Unix? Usually when I do all my design,

394
00:19:50,131 --> 00:19:53,370
it's in a notebook. And which means
that like in terms of creating art,

395
00:19:53,371 --> 00:19:56,130
if I don't really scan my notebooks so
it's hard to show off what's in them.

396
00:19:56,190 --> 00:19:58,620
Aside from scanning then, which
I don't do a, we sent you an io,

397
00:19:58,770 --> 00:20:00,870
it was designed not in the notebook.

398
00:20:00,900 --> 00:20:04,650
And so this gives us an
interesting glimpse into
easily scannable documents that

399
00:20:04,651 --> 00:20:09,450
show off the development of an out.
And have you guys already seen this,

400
00:20:09,451 --> 00:20:13,460
this set of documents from ordering the
special edition? Anybody get the special,

401
00:20:13,470 --> 00:20:15,960
the physical addition of
Schengen? Yeah. Okay, cool.

402
00:20:15,990 --> 00:20:18,210
So most of you haven't seen this,
so um,

403
00:20:22,200 --> 00:20:23,033
okay.

404
00:20:24,100 --> 00:20:28,960
Okay. So like all good things. A
lot of my games start with a list.

405
00:20:28,990 --> 00:20:33,130
So the idea obviously I guess like
when when we start working on a game,

406
00:20:33,131 --> 00:20:34,660
when I start thinking of a game,

407
00:20:34,661 --> 00:20:38,110
it's usually some kind of a lot of people
talking about game design in terms of

408
00:20:38,111 --> 00:20:38,921
like emotional stuff.

409
00:20:38,921 --> 00:20:40,960
You want to design something that
emotionally resonates with your players.

410
00:20:41,230 --> 00:20:42,400
Like for me it's sort of like a,

411
00:20:42,401 --> 00:20:45,550
as a program or like a mechanical
emotional resonance. Like, oh,

412
00:20:45,551 --> 00:20:47,530
it would be cool if there was
a system that worked this.

413
00:20:47,531 --> 00:20:50,920
Or like if you had a system where
like if we could take the idea of

414
00:20:50,940 --> 00:20:55,360
microcontrollers and like how circuits
work and how like like modern embedded

415
00:20:55,361 --> 00:20:57,430
systems work and turn that into a game.
Like there's,

416
00:20:57,610 --> 00:20:58,660
for me there's a feeling there.

417
00:20:58,661 --> 00:21:01,660
I don't know if other people have
feelings about like embedded programming

418
00:21:02,130 --> 00:21:04,990
resonating on an emotional level.
But like there's a thing there.

419
00:21:04,991 --> 00:21:08,080
There's a system and I think a lot of,
if you look at a lot of our games,

420
00:21:08,081 --> 00:21:10,840
clearly there are about systems. I'm
not coming to this from a story teller.

421
00:21:10,841 --> 00:21:14,430
I don't really know anything about making
telling stories but if people could do,

422
00:21:14,620 --> 00:21:15,310
but uh,

423
00:21:15,310 --> 00:21:18,310
but we're really a part that I bring to
this is the understanding of systems.

424
00:21:18,430 --> 00:21:22,690
And so like here on this totally
boring looking sheet of paper, right?

425
00:21:22,691 --> 00:21:24,370
I mean you can see some
ideas forming about like,

426
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:27,460
oh like these are some parts and
these are some differences. Like some,

427
00:21:27,461 --> 00:21:30,400
some abstract and differences
between like, like what's
the difference in flavor,

428
00:21:30,401 --> 00:21:34,090
what's the difference in emotion
between a micro controller and a DSP?

429
00:21:34,120 --> 00:21:36,720
And like in reality they're kind of the
same and they're just kind of like tune

430
00:21:36,730 --> 00:21:37,900
different ways.
But like there's,

431
00:21:38,150 --> 00:21:40,840
you can think about it in an abstract
way that's like an abstraction that has

432
00:21:40,841 --> 00:21:43,870
feelings of like, oh, dsps are really good
at math. And like there's certain, there,

433
00:21:44,030 --> 00:21:46,500
there's certain ways that they're
different and like there's,

434
00:21:46,510 --> 00:21:50,110
there's asymmetries that you can explain
it when making a puzzle game and said

435
00:21:50,111 --> 00:21:52,960
there's this sort of just like high
level like ideas of things that might be

436
00:21:52,961 --> 00:21:56,110
mechanics and like, uh, in this case
it's based on a real life system.

437
00:21:56,230 --> 00:22:00,400
This is sort of where the game starts
out and it probably doesn't spend that

438
00:22:00,401 --> 00:22:04,120
much time in this period. Um, I
like to think visually, right.

439
00:22:04,121 --> 00:22:07,480
So the best thing to get out as an idea
or some, some visual ideas of like,

440
00:22:07,510 --> 00:22:10,210
how would this look like as a system
you interacting with? Right. And I mean,

441
00:22:10,220 --> 00:22:14,020
so we've got a sketch it over, over on the
left side. It was curious or somewhere.

442
00:22:14,080 --> 00:22:17,140
So, um, this looks a lot like a node.

443
00:22:17,440 --> 00:22:21,550
And I know with the exception
of that depends coming up
the top and, uh, you know,

444
00:22:21,551 --> 00:22:24,130
you, you start to see some ideas kind of
forming just in these little sketches.

445
00:22:24,130 --> 00:22:27,250
And so I'm definitely a big fan of, of
drawing stuff to, to do that. And so,

446
00:22:27,400 --> 00:22:27,961
so from the,

447
00:22:27,961 --> 00:22:31,550
the basic high level ideas and the
emotions that turns into some sketches or

448
00:22:31,590 --> 00:22:35,740
start to kind of visually explore
some stuff like that. Um, we,

449
00:22:35,840 --> 00:22:39,010
we for change and I own particular,
we interviewed a bunny Juan,

450
00:22:39,090 --> 00:22:43,000
the engine guy and who everybody
goes to for anything about Schengen,

451
00:22:43,001 --> 00:22:45,610
which almost seems kind of kind of cliche
that we did, but he actually, you know,

452
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:49,150
like everybody does, he know that you
learned something good from him and a,

453
00:22:49,151 --> 00:22:51,850
and he told us about some more things
that were kind of like emotional points of

454
00:22:51,960 --> 00:22:56,260
doing development and engine and uh, like
midnight partner, you know, going to a,

455
00:22:56,261 --> 00:22:58,800
like a, the electronics wet markets
where it's just stalls, installs,

456
00:22:58,810 --> 00:23:01,030
installs of electronics and just like in
the middle of the night and you're like,

457
00:23:01,031 --> 00:23:04,990
wow, we need like 10,000 transistors, this
certain type, like time to go buy some.

458
00:23:05,230 --> 00:23:07,450
And then you come back with
a box of 10,000 transistors,

459
00:23:07,451 --> 00:23:09,640
which actually isn't even that big.
And uh,

460
00:23:10,060 --> 00:23:13,180
and like these are sort of like the
emotional things that I think go into,

461
00:23:13,181 --> 00:23:16,690
I mean, how many of you have [inaudible]
out? Right? So, okay. Some of you.

462
00:23:16,750 --> 00:23:19,360
So it's a game about on the surface you,

463
00:23:19,361 --> 00:23:23,260
you build circuit boards and dropdown
ships and in rate code for them.

464
00:23:23,261 --> 00:23:26,440
And then they do things they generate
like timing diagrams and they do stuff and

465
00:23:26,441 --> 00:23:27,340
uh,
but it's also,

466
00:23:27,341 --> 00:23:30,250
it has a pretty intense story where
there's a lot of emails of the people you

467
00:23:30,251 --> 00:23:30,680
work with.

468
00:23:30,680 --> 00:23:34,410
This company in Shenzhen being told and
they're funny and they argued some times

469
00:23:34,550 --> 00:23:37,720
and all of that stuff is
informed by things that we
learned about like what it's

470
00:23:37,721 --> 00:23:40,840
really like to be like an ex
pat in China and all of that.

471
00:23:40,840 --> 00:23:42,880
And I mean we don't really have
any firsthand experience with it,

472
00:23:42,881 --> 00:23:47,660
but we were able to get that
from, from talking to um,

473
00:23:47,750 --> 00:23:50,870
some actually some, some devices
that were invented in Shenzhen,

474
00:23:50,871 --> 00:23:52,940
which we didn't turn
puzzles turned into puzzles.

475
00:23:53,150 --> 00:23:57,200
I the Barbecue Times that tell you the
temperature of the thing you're talking.

476
00:23:57,530 --> 00:24:00,860
That was like an original Shinjin
invention. Not, not like a knock off.

477
00:24:00,861 --> 00:24:03,050
And same thing with the hoverboard,
although like I guess there's a market,

478
00:24:03,051 --> 00:24:06,560
planet money or whatever
about the debates, the, the
origin of the hoverboard.

479
00:24:07,790 --> 00:24:10,250
Um, so the, the thing I like to do,

480
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:12,800
this is really kind of diving
into my personal process,

481
00:24:12,801 --> 00:24:17,210
but I love making like little like black
and white gray scale pixel art that

482
00:24:17,211 --> 00:24:18,360
kind of lays out like what,

483
00:24:18,361 --> 00:24:21,760
what am I actually going to be dedicating
screen space to write and like this,

484
00:24:21,761 --> 00:24:24,410
this I guess some,
some people when they start making a game,

485
00:24:24,411 --> 00:24:26,930
let's start with concept
art. But for me it's, yeah,

486
00:24:26,931 --> 00:24:30,040
like incredibly detailed technical looking
things and cause this says just share

487
00:24:30,090 --> 00:24:33,020
like what is, what is the information
that's being depicted in this game?

488
00:24:33,410 --> 00:24:36,380
Like what, like what are we, what are
we dedicating space too? Like you can't,

489
00:24:36,410 --> 00:24:37,610
you kind of can't just say like,

490
00:24:37,640 --> 00:24:40,130
oh we're just going just to be able to
code stuff and they just make it scroll.

491
00:24:40,190 --> 00:24:42,860
I have a huge aversion
to scrolling in games.

492
00:24:42,980 --> 00:24:45,830
Like [inaudible] was the first game
I've ever really made where everything

493
00:24:45,831 --> 00:24:48,230
doesn't fit on the screen
all at once at one time.

494
00:24:49,070 --> 00:24:51,760
And like there's a reason for
that and it's because if there's,

495
00:24:51,770 --> 00:24:54,210
I don't know if anybody's read like the
tough, do you like design books? Right?

496
00:24:54,211 --> 00:24:55,460
He talks about like the PowerPoint effect.

497
00:24:55,620 --> 00:24:59,180
The lousy thing about
PowerPoint presentations is
that as soon as I flipped away

498
00:24:59,181 --> 00:25:01,220
from something, you're going to
forget what I was just showing you.

499
00:25:01,430 --> 00:25:03,740
And if you can't kind of look
at two things side by side,

500
00:25:03,741 --> 00:25:05,420
it makes it really hard
to compare them visually.

501
00:25:05,610 --> 00:25:09,140
Like that's a huge part of how
our brains work. So, um, yeah,

502
00:25:09,141 --> 00:25:11,780
so everything fits on one screen.
Most in most electronics games, all,

503
00:25:11,800 --> 00:25:14,570
we're slightly pulling away from
that like machine engine. But uh,

504
00:25:14,810 --> 00:25:18,050
but we can look at information. Um,
here's the design of Schengen solitary.

505
00:25:18,080 --> 00:25:22,850
It was just on this piece of paper.
Um, from there we have to come up with,

506
00:25:22,851 --> 00:25:25,040
and this is I guess sort of a
newer thing with electronic scans.

507
00:25:25,060 --> 00:25:29,120
When we did space camp, I have,
who's plays Bass Con. Cool. Okay.

508
00:25:29,150 --> 00:25:33,410
So one of the biggest flaws perhaps what's
base camp is that all of the puzzles

509
00:25:33,470 --> 00:25:36,740
just have you make chemicals for no
reason at all. Right? It's just like, oh,

510
00:25:36,741 --> 00:25:41,050
we need a bunch of s settling because, and
like that's it. And that's like, that's,

511
00:25:41,270 --> 00:25:43,430
we have a story and the story's over here.

512
00:25:43,460 --> 00:25:46,490
And then we asked you for acetylene
over here and there's no like connection

513
00:25:46,491 --> 00:25:48,530
between the two. And one of the
biggest complaints we got from, from,

514
00:25:48,531 --> 00:25:50,940
from space camp was that,
um,

515
00:25:51,140 --> 00:25:54,350
it would be great if there was any kind
of story justification for why you're

516
00:25:54,351 --> 00:25:58,070
building what you're building any at
all. And uh, and that was, I think that,

517
00:25:58,071 --> 00:25:59,990
I guess that was one of the ones that
really resonate. I think it was like,

518
00:25:59,991 --> 00:26:02,630
oh yeah, that's right. Like they
don't mean anything, you know.

519
00:26:02,631 --> 00:26:06,830
So with trying to think, I guess
with, within Finna factory,

520
00:26:06,831 --> 00:26:07,850
we started exploring with that.

521
00:26:07,851 --> 00:26:11,030
Like what if you could make things
that actually fit into the story and we

522
00:26:11,040 --> 00:26:12,410
Shinjin we wouldn't even harder with it.

523
00:26:12,560 --> 00:26:16,160
And so every puzzle in Shinjin is based
off of a little pitch that our writer

524
00:26:16,161 --> 00:26:18,230
wrote and that we brainstormed before.

525
00:26:18,230 --> 00:26:21,290
But we turned them into these things like
we want to build a little story around

526
00:26:21,291 --> 00:26:23,060
each puzzle and a,

527
00:26:23,061 --> 00:26:26,270
and we want to like bring that puzzle
to life by creating a context around it

528
00:26:26,271 --> 00:26:29,840
that gives it meaning. Um, and I think
it was really successful. I don't know.

529
00:26:29,870 --> 00:26:34,290
I mean you guys can, can tell me. Um, so,
so in this case, I mean like how did it,

530
00:26:34,320 --> 00:26:36,590
there's tons of ideas here for puzzles.
A lot of them we didn't do,

531
00:26:36,591 --> 00:26:40,100
cause they're really hard to turn into
like a magic baseball bat. I'm like,

532
00:26:40,101 --> 00:26:44,520
this is, this isn't our sort of near
future. Everything is lousy or future.

533
00:26:44,670 --> 00:26:48,360
Um, we uh, yeah, okay. I was going to make
a political check but I'm not going to.

534
00:26:48,600 --> 00:26:51,870
But um, but you know, the idea
like, Oh, magic baseball bat,

535
00:26:51,871 --> 00:26:55,050
it's like the selfie stick or the
baseball bat of selfie sticks I guess.

536
00:26:55,050 --> 00:26:57,390
Like it just makes you hit a
home run every time. Right.

537
00:26:57,430 --> 00:26:59,040
And it fits the medically,

538
00:26:59,041 --> 00:27:01,620
but it's kind of hard to think of like
how do you make a puzzle that like,

539
00:27:01,650 --> 00:27:04,380
is that, and I guess
it's like, I dunno. So,

540
00:27:04,381 --> 00:27:06,060
so not all the ideas really make the cut,

541
00:27:06,061 --> 00:27:08,760
but we got a lot of my good ideas here
and then we start turning them into

542
00:27:08,761 --> 00:27:09,480
puzzles.

543
00:27:09,480 --> 00:27:12,810
And so one of my other little quirks is
that I like the design every puzzle on a

544
00:27:12,811 --> 00:27:16,110
sheet of paper because then you can
start them separately. You can right now,

545
00:27:16,111 --> 00:27:19,320
like we're working on a game that has
puzzled like things in it and they're all

546
00:27:19,321 --> 00:27:22,660
pinned up on the wall. Like I'm some
sort of like person, like, like uh, like,

547
00:27:22,720 --> 00:27:26,010
like detective that went rogue and it's
like all the connections drawn up on the

548
00:27:26,011 --> 00:27:29,100
wall and like the string
running in between them and
I can see the pattern. Yeah.

549
00:27:29,220 --> 00:27:29,980
So with,

550
00:27:29,980 --> 00:27:32,760
with paper you can do that is that you
can pin up all your designs and you can

551
00:27:32,761 --> 00:27:35,760
see them all at once and you can use
your sort of like the visual part of your

552
00:27:35,761 --> 00:27:38,210
brain to, to, to see like, Oh,
do I not have enough of the,

553
00:27:38,220 --> 00:27:42,150
this mechanic being represented or
whatnot. Um, making forms was fun too.

554
00:27:42,151 --> 00:27:44,880
I guess that's like a more of a reflection
of my personality that I like making

555
00:27:44,881 --> 00:27:49,470
forms and filling them out. But so from
there, yeah, I mean we just, you know,

556
00:27:49,471 --> 00:27:53,380
like every, every puzzle has its
own little little form. And uh,

557
00:27:53,610 --> 00:27:55,980
to get back to your original question,
which I think I have to virtual highlight,

558
00:27:56,130 --> 00:27:59,700
which is how much time do we spend making
the original mechanics versus coming

559
00:27:59,701 --> 00:28:01,440
up with puzzles?
Um,

560
00:28:01,800 --> 00:28:04,310
I'd say it sort of that there's a
little bit of time up front, uh,

561
00:28:04,380 --> 00:28:06,030
for coming up with the
mechanics of the game.

562
00:28:06,030 --> 00:28:08,700
And then I like to just try to make a
whole bunch of puzzles without even being

563
00:28:08,701 --> 00:28:12,420
on a plan, which I guess is another
word, electronic state that we make all,

564
00:28:12,421 --> 00:28:16,120
I make all of my puzzles without
really testing room. And then, um,

565
00:28:16,230 --> 00:28:18,690
the ones that don't work don't
go in the game at the end.

566
00:28:18,750 --> 00:28:22,760
Sometimes they do and then they get
replaced afterwards and it Kinda,

567
00:28:22,770 --> 00:28:24,480
I don't know,
I mean our games are really open ended.

568
00:28:24,481 --> 00:28:27,210
Like our games are usually that we built
a tool set and then we bought a bunch

569
00:28:27,211 --> 00:28:29,940
of challenges and we build
them independently so that
way you can kind of tackle

570
00:28:29,941 --> 00:28:31,530
the problems however you
want with the tool set.

571
00:28:31,800 --> 00:28:33,540
And that comes across in the end,

572
00:28:33,541 --> 00:28:37,250
the puzzle design kind of
mechanism that we follow. Um,

573
00:28:37,410 --> 00:28:39,210
I guess the other thing too is
that especially with Schengen,

574
00:28:39,370 --> 00:28:43,560
we change our toolset as we realize
like what is possible and what isn't

575
00:28:43,561 --> 00:28:46,290
possible in with the tool set. And they'll
give you, while you saw the puzzles.

576
00:28:46,500 --> 00:28:49,800
And so like essentially like a really
boring example is the memory that all of

577
00:28:49,801 --> 00:28:51,320
our memory used to be that like you'd,

578
00:28:51,520 --> 00:28:54,570
you'd write to it and it would store the
values and you'd read from it and then

579
00:28:54,571 --> 00:28:56,790
you get them back and that was all you
could do and it turns out that's like

580
00:28:56,840 --> 00:28:57,451
really useless.

581
00:28:57,451 --> 00:29:00,600
And if you wanted to like read from it
non destructively you'd have to read and

582
00:29:00,601 --> 00:29:03,450
like everything and then somehow rate it
back in and it just made everything too

583
00:29:03,451 --> 00:29:05,670
hard. And so like right up until
the last minute of stringent Ya,

584
00:29:05,671 --> 00:29:07,170
we were still changing
mechanics in the game.

585
00:29:07,590 --> 00:29:12,590
So that's like you never really get to
stop working on your mechanics or your

586
00:29:12,751 --> 00:29:15,870
puzzles or anything. I don't, I
don't know what the moral there is.

587
00:29:17,880 --> 00:29:22,140
Does that answer your question person
who didn't ask that question? Oh well

588
00:29:24,660 --> 00:29:27,330
does that answer your question?
Person who did ask that question?

589
00:29:29,210 --> 00:29:32,640
This one is actually from someone who's
not, how do you make your games fun?

590
00:29:32,760 --> 00:29:35,280
I've tried to make educational games
in the past and might have turned out

591
00:29:35,281 --> 00:29:39,050
pedantic and Fiji whereas
yours are actually fun. Does
that your question? Oh, I,

592
00:29:39,060 --> 00:29:42,970
this is the person that I wanted to
grill so I wanted to find out like why,

593
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:46,840
what makes them think that Tektronix games
or educational or what makes them fun?

594
00:29:46,841 --> 00:29:51,130
Right. Because it's possible
that they're neither, but yeah,

595
00:29:51,230 --> 00:29:52,900
to constantly easier if I
had somebody to escalate it.

596
00:29:52,901 --> 00:29:55,060
Does anybody want to like proxy
for that person and like feel,

597
00:29:55,061 --> 00:29:57,820
has anybody tried to making educational
games here and there like disappointed

598
00:29:57,860 --> 00:30:02,740
without it was that, was
that a hand raised but just
to stretch. Okay. Yeah. So,

599
00:30:02,741 --> 00:30:05,260
um, I guess I have to imagine, Oh,

600
00:30:05,770 --> 00:30:07,240
you can proxy to be if you want.

601
00:30:07,300 --> 00:30:10,610
I have done a little bit of work and
we can be educational games. Yeah.

602
00:30:10,620 --> 00:30:12,480
Years ago as a contractor

603
00:30:14,250 --> 00:30:19,090
and I also do find these games fine.
Yeah. The answer perhaps as to why. Okay.

604
00:30:19,380 --> 00:30:21,010
Do you want a proxy through be,
go ahead.

605
00:30:21,100 --> 00:30:23,470
Sorry. That's what, what's your
opinion of educational games?

606
00:30:24,910 --> 00:30:29,260
Oftentimes it seems like there's some
particular lesson that equal that is the

607
00:30:29,261 --> 00:30:33,040
creator and the educational game
watch these students to learn. Um,

608
00:30:33,730 --> 00:30:37,420
and it's very difficult to make that
into a game and it doesn't fit anything

609
00:30:37,421 --> 00:30:41,110
bear. It just so happens I think
that we're particular mentality.

610
00:30:41,350 --> 00:30:42,910
Engineering is fun.
Yeah.

611
00:30:42,980 --> 00:30:45,370
And so if you could make a game
where you're just doing it,

612
00:30:45,380 --> 00:30:46,960
engineering the fun parts,

613
00:30:47,320 --> 00:30:51,610
then it stopped how educational
but also still fun. Yeah.

614
00:30:51,800 --> 00:30:52,541
I like for me,

615
00:30:52,541 --> 00:30:56,110
I will say personally as somebody who
came into computer science through,

616
00:30:56,111 --> 00:30:59,200
maybe it did have a nontraditional
route actually vaguely computer science

617
00:30:59,201 --> 00:31:00,350
education,
um,

618
00:31:00,870 --> 00:31:05,250
Shinzen Iot as were up 141st time that
I ever actually did a separate program.

619
00:31:05,340 --> 00:31:07,360
Oh yeah.
Also I learned something there.

620
00:31:07,450 --> 00:31:11,030
Yeah. That's okay. So, so that's, that
was the perfect answer. Thank you. So,

621
00:31:12,190 --> 00:31:16,900
um, so my, my personal, I
mean for me I guess God, okay,

622
00:31:16,901 --> 00:31:20,620
so space cam made space.
Kim was like, okay, this,

623
00:31:20,621 --> 00:31:23,740
this game looks so educational.
Like if I believe that,

624
00:31:23,741 --> 00:31:26,050
like pretty pretty thoroughly
believe that like we can,

625
00:31:26,051 --> 00:31:27,640
if only we can make
education like space camp,

626
00:31:27,670 --> 00:31:29,170
everybody would love it
and it would be great.

627
00:31:29,171 --> 00:31:31,600
And like you know this kind
of like the idea of taking,

628
00:31:31,990 --> 00:31:35,050
taking systems and problems and presenting
them to people in a way that they can

629
00:31:35,051 --> 00:31:38,470
solve them and an open ended
fashion without having to
just like learn stuff and

630
00:31:38,471 --> 00:31:39,430
recite it later.

631
00:31:39,550 --> 00:31:43,870
Like that seems like it would just blow
education wide open and a and it didn't.

632
00:31:43,900 --> 00:31:47,740
And so I started really enthusiastic
and we made these educational games once

633
00:31:47,741 --> 00:31:52,000
that I showed you before. And like I,

634
00:31:52,030 --> 00:31:53,590
I would say as we were doing the projects,

635
00:31:53,591 --> 00:31:56,260
my enthusiasm kind of
like crashed pretty hard.

636
00:31:56,530 --> 00:31:59,160
And by the time we got to the end it's
like, why are we making these games?

637
00:31:59,170 --> 00:32:00,930
And I think that like part of,

638
00:32:00,931 --> 00:32:05,590
part of the problem was that when we
make a game for real, we, it just,

639
00:32:05,591 --> 00:32:07,690
it just is what it is. And we
put it out there and we say, hey,

640
00:32:07,691 --> 00:32:10,240
whoever wants to play this,
play it. If you like it,

641
00:32:10,270 --> 00:32:13,390
you'll let us know by buying
it or whatever. But you
make an educational game.

642
00:32:13,391 --> 00:32:17,200
Like they were testing him and they were
like forcing the kids to play them and

643
00:32:17,201 --> 00:32:19,420
just like sitting them down and saying,
you're going to play this game now.

644
00:32:19,450 --> 00:32:21,660
And then the kids would play it cause
they were told to or whatever and if the

645
00:32:21,670 --> 00:32:24,100
game, so I guess it's better
than like do this math problem,

646
00:32:24,400 --> 00:32:25,600
like kind of not like they didn't,

647
00:32:25,601 --> 00:32:28,000
they don't really have any agency and
doing that, which is a big thing and game.

648
00:32:28,450 --> 00:32:30,970
And uh, and then they asked
them afterwards, they're like,

649
00:32:30,971 --> 00:32:34,180
now they're never going to quiz them on
what they learned. And it's just like,

650
00:32:34,181 --> 00:32:36,760
Oh God, like these kids, they're there.
They're, they're like in middle school.

651
00:32:36,761 --> 00:32:39,470
Like they're not really good at expressing
themselves. And even if they are like,

652
00:32:39,471 --> 00:32:40,400
they're just kinda like,

653
00:32:40,820 --> 00:32:43,360
like saying the answers are
not saying the answer is it is,

654
00:32:43,410 --> 00:32:46,310
you're just so far divorced from what
it is to make a game at that point.

655
00:32:46,311 --> 00:32:49,460
Then it's just like it for
me, it destroyed all of like
the motivation. It's like,

656
00:32:49,461 --> 00:32:50,001
why are we like,

657
00:32:50,001 --> 00:32:52,880
are we improving their lives by making
these games and making them play them?

658
00:32:52,881 --> 00:32:54,700
And it's like, well,
not really because it,

659
00:32:55,020 --> 00:32:56,330
and then you start getting
the question for like, look,

660
00:32:56,331 --> 00:32:59,810
what is the point of education, right?
Like in curriculum. And I guess I, this,

661
00:32:59,811 --> 00:33:02,600
this is again a reflection of me,
I guess more than any sort of reality,

662
00:33:02,601 --> 00:33:07,290
but like the, the idea of like the idea
of an educational game, it's, it's,

663
00:33:07,291 --> 00:33:11,090
it's, there's already so much bias just
saying that like an educational game and,

664
00:33:11,091 --> 00:33:13,670
uh, that like it's meant for a school
system. It's meant for a curriculum.

665
00:33:13,671 --> 00:33:17,770
It's really hard to design games to that.
Like you said. And I, I was, here's the,

666
00:33:17,771 --> 00:33:22,490
here's a fun anecdote for me is that I
was at a serious games convention back

667
00:33:22,491 --> 00:33:26,480
when I was in my more naive stage and
thought that we can make educational games

668
00:33:26,481 --> 00:33:29,290
that are great and the Games would
save the world or whatever. And uh,

669
00:33:29,440 --> 00:33:31,430
and somebody,
there was somebody there from full sail.

670
00:33:31,550 --> 00:33:33,050
It was saying that they'd
made an educational game,

671
00:33:33,051 --> 00:33:36,080
but the lesson they learned is that you
have education and you have fun and you

672
00:33:36,081 --> 00:33:39,460
just have to kind of dial in, like
where on the spectrum, like you want,

673
00:33:39,500 --> 00:33:42,200
you want a hint. Right. And
of course their game was
terrible. I'm not gonna lie,

674
00:33:42,260 --> 00:33:45,320
it was a game where you go around and
fight people and then do math problems.

675
00:33:45,470 --> 00:33:48,530
And so it's like there's fighting and
then there's math problems would pop up

676
00:33:48,531 --> 00:33:49,191
and it's like,
okay,

677
00:33:49,191 --> 00:33:51,380
like I guess we can agree that that's
probably not the best way to do an

678
00:33:51,381 --> 00:33:52,550
educational game.
But,

679
00:33:52,870 --> 00:33:56,180
but I actually had the audacity to like
raise my hand and challenge the person

680
00:33:56,181 --> 00:33:58,550
who was talking and just be like,
wait, I like, this is ridiculous.

681
00:33:58,551 --> 00:34:01,700
It's like surely we can make games that
are fun and educational by exploiting

682
00:34:01,701 --> 00:34:03,620
the naturally fun things,
like an engineering,

683
00:34:03,740 --> 00:34:06,500
exploiting the naturally fun
things in the educational content.

684
00:34:06,740 --> 00:34:07,910
And then after having made them,

685
00:34:07,911 --> 00:34:11,200
I actually kind of feel like there's fun
and there's education and you just kind

686
00:34:11,201 --> 00:34:13,760
of dial it in and drop it in.
And like there's, there's,

687
00:34:13,790 --> 00:34:15,910
there's perhaps some reason to
believe that like education,

688
00:34:15,911 --> 00:34:19,670
like learning things is hard and things
that are hard are not fun in the way

689
00:34:19,671 --> 00:34:21,870
that games are. Right.
Like you need like there,

690
00:34:21,871 --> 00:34:23,430
there's all sorts of
stuff about like flat,

691
00:34:23,440 --> 00:34:25,760
like I don't know how many of you
know about like flow theory in games?

692
00:34:26,160 --> 00:34:26,620
Yeah.

693
00:34:26,620 --> 00:34:29,140
The idea that like as you're playing
a game you're going to get better.

694
00:34:29,170 --> 00:34:31,630
And like there's like a,
this is like a graph,

695
00:34:31,631 --> 00:34:35,110
there's an area up here that's like
too I guess like too hard for you and

696
00:34:35,111 --> 00:34:37,810
there's an area down here
that's too boring and so you
just want to kind of stay

697
00:34:37,811 --> 00:34:39,640
in this channel of not
being bored but not being,

698
00:34:39,730 --> 00:34:42,760
having the game be so hard that you
can't play and you can't advance and like

699
00:34:42,761 --> 00:34:45,670
education does not line up with that.
It doesn't fit in.

700
00:34:45,671 --> 00:34:48,760
Like you can't just like they're there
that you can hope that like I guess you

701
00:34:48,761 --> 00:34:51,430
can kind of design a game so that like
people get slightly better or you like

702
00:34:51,490 --> 00:34:54,490
more often than not now you kind of
boost to their power level by giving them

703
00:34:54,491 --> 00:34:56,530
experience and like
upgrading their numbers.

704
00:34:56,531 --> 00:34:59,080
Like this is like a huge thing that's
like the straight game design as far as

705
00:34:59,081 --> 00:35:01,870
I'm concerned. But like it's
like, cause there's, there's,

706
00:35:01,871 --> 00:35:04,210
there's theories about difficulty and a
lot of people like say like, you know,

707
00:35:04,211 --> 00:35:06,040
people, people need to feel better
while they're playing your game.

708
00:35:06,070 --> 00:35:08,590
Like let's just make their, make the
numbers bigger while they're playing it.

709
00:35:08,620 --> 00:35:11,680
You can't do that in an educational
game, right? You can't just say like,

710
00:35:11,710 --> 00:35:13,450
oh your sword now does more damage,

711
00:35:13,451 --> 00:35:15,700
but we're going to give you the same
math problems or we're not going to get,

712
00:35:15,730 --> 00:35:17,560
you can't, like you can't
count on people getting better,

713
00:35:17,561 --> 00:35:20,890
especially at like external skills that
aren't even really part of the game.

714
00:35:20,990 --> 00:35:22,400
That's,
it's difficult.

715
00:35:22,790 --> 00:35:27,170
So I think that moves nicely to how
do you view the difficulty curves and

716
00:35:27,171 --> 00:35:28,580
teaching process in each of your games?

717
00:35:28,581 --> 00:35:30,970
Is there anything you ever wish you had
done differently or anything that you

718
00:35:30,971 --> 00:35:31,804
want to try some day?

719
00:35:32,210 --> 00:35:35,240
I have a picture for this one was more
interesting than trying to explain it.

720
00:35:35,580 --> 00:35:40,530
So this is a graph for space camp.
And so what this represents,

721
00:35:40,560 --> 00:35:44,010
each one had to be used as a puzzle.
These are the blue ones are the sort of

722
00:35:46,350 --> 00:35:48,420
blue ones are required and
yellow ones are optional.

723
00:35:48,450 --> 00:35:51,390
And the red ones are the boss
puzzles, which you have to, they're,

724
00:35:51,391 --> 00:35:55,100
they're a special kind of challenge in
space come. That's kind of hard. Um,

725
00:35:55,890 --> 00:35:59,410
both because it's a hard puzzle and
because it's like obscure as the game play

726
00:35:59,411 --> 00:36:01,680
in a way that makes it harder to solve.
And uh,

727
00:36:01,681 --> 00:36:03,270
and so what this is for each one of these,

728
00:36:03,420 --> 00:36:06,540
how many people started up
a puzzle and then solved it?

729
00:36:07,530 --> 00:36:12,420
And so, um, it's, it's Kinda,
it's kind of the same overall.

730
00:36:12,421 --> 00:36:14,780
We can see the optional positions, right?
There's a lot more people who like,

731
00:36:14,790 --> 00:36:17,910
there's a lot fewer people
who upon starting up an
optional puzzle actually took

732
00:36:17,911 --> 00:36:20,390
the time to finish it.
Every other puzzle in the game were,

733
00:36:20,400 --> 00:36:22,350
was required and often
the sequential order,

734
00:36:22,351 --> 00:36:25,230
which is a thing that we learned
is not a good thing to do. Um,

735
00:36:25,530 --> 00:36:28,710
and so like they're,
they're pretty, pretty good.

736
00:36:28,711 --> 00:36:32,220
The boss puzzles is definitely harder to
the last boss is definitely like people

737
00:36:32,221 --> 00:36:35,070
got to these poor people who
beat every other level up here,

738
00:36:35,100 --> 00:36:38,220
fired up to this level and then only
half of them finished it. Right.

739
00:36:38,250 --> 00:36:40,350
That includes me.
I'm in the people who didn't finish this.

740
00:36:40,351 --> 00:36:43,180
I've never eaten the last
level of space camp and says,

741
00:36:43,200 --> 00:36:45,450
I don't know how you can expect
somebody to like do something like that.

742
00:36:46,690 --> 00:36:51,000
Not necessarily. Yeah, that
would be graph number two,

743
00:36:51,001 --> 00:36:55,410
which looks more like this. So, um, this
one is what happens when you multiply.

744
00:36:55,411 --> 00:36:58,440
Basically you multiply
each one by like the,

745
00:36:58,441 --> 00:37:02,180
all the ones before it and a and have
it fall off. And then, yeah, like if,

746
00:37:02,181 --> 00:37:04,790
if you're, if you fire up
the game, this is your,

747
00:37:04,791 --> 00:37:06,810
your odds of actually
beating the last level,

748
00:37:06,811 --> 00:37:09,750
which I guess makes that fall
off look Lester medic. But

749
00:37:11,430 --> 00:37:14,400
to some degree I would say our games are
pretty bad. But to some degree the game,

750
00:37:14,401 --> 00:37:17,070
you know, like your, your progress
for any game looks like this.

751
00:37:17,071 --> 00:37:20,070
Like I mean how many, how many games that
you guys play? Do you actually finish?

752
00:37:20,100 --> 00:37:24,600
Right? It's probably less than a hundred
percent. And um, so you can actually,

753
00:37:24,601 --> 00:37:27,840
you can look at achievements in other
games. I used to have a slide for this,

754
00:37:27,841 --> 00:37:30,870
but it's on here about like how
many people beat various games.

755
00:37:31,020 --> 00:37:35,520
So like a fashion or no,
um, I guess fashion. Yeah,

756
00:37:35,521 --> 00:37:37,890
like that was beaten by like
15% of people who started it up.

757
00:37:37,891 --> 00:37:41,580
Super meat boy is beaten by about
4% of people who fire it up. Right.

758
00:37:41,581 --> 00:37:42,780
And that's just not a normal like,

759
00:37:42,830 --> 00:37:47,280
like super duper hard mode is like 2% or
1% it's cam is super duper hard, right?

760
00:37:47,281 --> 00:37:50,910
It's like 2%. So it's like 2%
of people who fire up space can,

761
00:37:50,911 --> 00:37:52,590
we'll actually go through
and beat all of it.

762
00:37:52,591 --> 00:37:54,330
And so that's on one hand that's bad.

763
00:37:54,331 --> 00:37:57,690
And that's not really like what I
would want. But on the other hand,

764
00:37:57,930 --> 00:38:00,660
that means that there's a lot of
challenges for people all along the game.

765
00:38:00,661 --> 00:38:02,610
And we actually,
this is something we debate a lot still,

766
00:38:02,611 --> 00:38:06,000
which is like how long should the Gambian,
how hard should it be? And you kind of,

767
00:38:06,240 --> 00:38:09,420
you kind of don't want somebody, well
I guess it depends. I don't know.

768
00:38:09,421 --> 00:38:11,850
I mean it's, it's
possible, perhaps a theory.

769
00:38:11,851 --> 00:38:15,690
It would be that you want people to
play through your game until they,

770
00:38:15,840 --> 00:38:17,850
until they decide to stop.
Right?

771
00:38:17,851 --> 00:38:20,760
It's worse if they play through a game
and then have to stop because they ran

772
00:38:20,761 --> 00:38:24,180
out of content or like some other reason,
right?

773
00:38:24,181 --> 00:38:26,550
Like you want people to choose to
stop and having the game get harder,

774
00:38:26,551 --> 00:38:30,290
like kind of accomplishes that.
And so I, I personally feel like I,

775
00:38:30,300 --> 00:38:33,150
I'd feel disappointed if I don't beat
something, but other people are different.

776
00:38:33,200 --> 00:38:37,510
And, but that's still a debate that
we still, we wonder about. Um, so,

777
00:38:38,360 --> 00:38:38,950
okay.

778
00:38:38,950 --> 00:38:40,280
Playing off this for a second. Okay. Yeah,

779
00:38:40,281 --> 00:38:44,030
I'm just going to how quick you can line
up. But the, um, the thing that this is,

780
00:38:44,031 --> 00:38:47,960
this is actually, this graph is not
really useful. It's, it makes a point,

781
00:38:47,961 --> 00:38:51,350
but it's not useful to us. And
balancing a game, a graph like this is,

782
00:38:51,351 --> 00:38:52,850
this is how we do all of our stuff.

783
00:38:52,851 --> 00:38:56,330
And we actually did a survey in of
factory during early access where we ask

784
00:38:56,331 --> 00:38:59,420
people after they beat a puzzle, we only
showed the survey people would be in it.

785
00:38:59,421 --> 00:39:02,240
We said, how hard do you feel
like this level was? It wasn't it,

786
00:39:02,241 --> 00:39:04,940
was it too hard or was it too
easy or was it just right?

787
00:39:05,090 --> 00:39:09,400
And when you look at the levels that
people say, I beat that level. I'm like,

788
00:39:09,401 --> 00:39:11,750
I feel good because I beat it.
But it was too hard.

789
00:39:11,810 --> 00:39:14,330
Actually correlates close enough for us,

790
00:39:14,331 --> 00:39:16,730
which is not really necessarily
statistically good enough,

791
00:39:16,731 --> 00:39:18,200
but like it's good enough for us.
It,

792
00:39:18,240 --> 00:39:21,350
it correlates pretty strongly with people
who fire it up a level and then never

793
00:39:21,351 --> 00:39:22,270
even be in it. And the, the,

794
00:39:22,300 --> 00:39:24,860
the cool thing there is that we can
measure this without bothering people in,

795
00:39:24,870 --> 00:39:28,430
without asking them and without like
making them kind of English over when was

796
00:39:28,431 --> 00:39:29,300
it too hard or not.

797
00:39:29,301 --> 00:39:32,060
Like we can just track this stat and we
do and then we track with stat and all

798
00:39:32,061 --> 00:39:36,710
of her games. And uh, nowadays something
like this right here would say, okay,

799
00:39:36,711 --> 00:39:41,030
this level is too hard because like
they should all be claimed a flat and I

800
00:39:41,031 --> 00:39:42,770
don't have a picture of
it for infinite factory,

801
00:39:42,771 --> 00:39:45,100
but when in a factory it was pretty good.
Like the easy way,

802
00:39:45,140 --> 00:39:47,480
like the first levels were pretty
easy and then it kind of picks up the

803
00:39:47,481 --> 00:39:50,300
difficulty through here and then it was
pretty flat through the rest of the game

804
00:39:50,301 --> 00:39:53,620
cause we're looking at them
individually and uh, and,

805
00:39:53,730 --> 00:39:56,210
and then sometimes it'd be a puzzle
that spikes up and it was like twice.

806
00:39:56,210 --> 00:39:59,390
It's like, you know, it, it has like twice
the fail, like fell out rate or whatever.

807
00:39:59,391 --> 00:40:01,070
And then that's how we know
that puzzle is too hard.

808
00:40:01,071 --> 00:40:02,930
So that's how we bounce our games.
I don't know if that's the best way,

809
00:40:02,931 --> 00:40:03,764
but that's how we do it.

810
00:40:05,370 --> 00:40:06,203
Um,

811
00:40:06,470 --> 00:40:11,470
do you have any kind of data on how much
the social factor of space can kind of

812
00:40:13,040 --> 00:40:17,150
help people where should keep on
bleeding? Uh, I mean, just the,

813
00:40:17,180 --> 00:40:19,430
this text comparison then Instagram's,
yeah,

814
00:40:19,440 --> 00:40:21,830
because I was one of the
ones that didn't finish it,

815
00:40:22,280 --> 00:40:26,450
but I did come back to some levels
because of the social factor,

816
00:40:26,451 --> 00:40:31,130
Lou comparison with other players and
kind of tried to optimize my solutions.

817
00:40:31,470 --> 00:40:32,670
That would be a good thing to track.

818
00:40:34,040 --> 00:40:36,660
It's hard to tell like why
somebody is playing a level.

819
00:40:36,780 --> 00:40:38,850
And so I think that's kind of why
that's, we haven't explored that. Like,

820
00:40:38,851 --> 00:40:39,800
the big thing I like the,

821
00:40:39,801 --> 00:40:42,510
the first thing I worry about is
people just stopping playing our game.

822
00:40:42,511 --> 00:40:45,720
Because if you can't, if you can't play
a game, it'll be impossible to enjoy it.

823
00:40:45,970 --> 00:40:48,810
Right? And so, so that's
sort of our first priority.

824
00:40:49,080 --> 00:40:51,960
That would definitely be something
interesting to explore. Um, the idea of,

825
00:40:51,961 --> 00:40:55,620
of what keeps people coming back. Um, to
some degree we're a little cynical, right?

826
00:40:55,621 --> 00:40:58,980
That like you compare, like does it
does a new customer, like, you know,

827
00:40:59,010 --> 00:41:01,440
we could have somebody keep playing
the game for longer or we can get a new

828
00:41:01,441 --> 00:41:04,680
customer and like, which
ones, which one is better?

829
00:41:04,790 --> 00:41:07,440
A one theory we have is that the
longer that somebody is playing a game,

830
00:41:07,441 --> 00:41:09,210
the more likely it is to
expose their friends too.

831
00:41:09,211 --> 00:41:11,280
It sort of like if somebody
has a cold for longer,

832
00:41:11,281 --> 00:41:14,760
they're more likely to share it with
their friends in a similar way. Um,

833
00:41:15,030 --> 00:41:17,550
and so that's something we think
about but have very little data for

834
00:41:19,280 --> 00:41:22,130
where did the idea of
having the social parts,

835
00:41:22,620 --> 00:41:27,240
oh, I, I have a thing for that somewhere.
Oh, right here. Oh yeah. I have this,

836
00:41:27,241 --> 00:41:29,220
this is fine. What we'll get to,
this'll be like the ending thing.

837
00:41:29,221 --> 00:41:33,380
Maybe I'm just gonna do the beginning
of it. So I'm with the codex. Uh,

838
00:41:33,381 --> 00:41:36,260
so I made this game. It was just a
flash game. There were no histograms.

839
00:41:36,261 --> 00:41:38,930
There are no leaderboards.
Um, but there were,

840
00:41:38,931 --> 00:41:41,990
there were forums where people would
start competing with each other

841
00:41:41,991 --> 00:41:45,710
spontaneously. This happened is they'd
be like, oh, that's your solution.

842
00:41:45,950 --> 00:41:47,810
This is my solution. It's, it's better.

843
00:41:47,840 --> 00:41:51,440
Like I was able to shave off five cycles
by doing this and they'd share it and

844
00:41:51,441 --> 00:41:52,790
they'd just be like one upping each other.

845
00:41:53,070 --> 00:41:57,620
And we thought of this when we did space
camp and the ways that we kind of made

846
00:41:57,621 --> 00:42:02,540
this a real thing we made an official
was with histograms wear out.

847
00:42:02,600 --> 00:42:06,410
But the funny thing is actually we weren't
on steam for a while, a space camp.

848
00:42:06,411 --> 00:42:09,350
So we couldn't do leader boards that
because we won't have to like roll our own

849
00:42:09,351 --> 00:42:13,780
little litter word service or something.
I don't know. We didn't. So, um, so we,

850
00:42:13,781 --> 00:42:16,530
we only had the histograms and then the
leader boards were just sort of an out,

851
00:42:16,540 --> 00:42:19,940
almost like a, it wasn't very
deliberate. Right. We're like, oh,

852
00:42:19,941 --> 00:42:23,060
steam offers friend leaderboards,
friend leader boards are good. I drank,

853
00:42:23,090 --> 00:42:24,620
I'd heard somewhere probably like a GDC,

854
00:42:24,720 --> 00:42:27,680
like global leader boards are useless
because obviously they are right. Like,

855
00:42:27,681 --> 00:42:28,760
you're not going to be number one,

856
00:42:28,761 --> 00:42:30,770
you're going to be number
like 10,000 no one cares.

857
00:42:30,890 --> 00:42:33,620
Friendlier boards are
like get people riled up.

858
00:42:33,621 --> 00:42:36,290
People like friendly towards and it
just kinda made sense for or against.

859
00:42:36,291 --> 00:42:38,180
But again, like we, I felt
like I didn't think about it.

860
00:42:38,190 --> 00:42:39,500
I don't remember thinking
about it very hard.

861
00:42:39,501 --> 00:42:41,510
I think we just kind of added it because
it seemed like the right thing to do

862
00:42:41,511 --> 00:42:44,440
for getting on steam kind of naive then.
And uh,

863
00:42:44,510 --> 00:42:47,480
and I think honestly the leaderboards
and probably better than the histograms.

864
00:42:47,481 --> 00:42:49,820
Like not everybody has friends who
play their games, but like the,

865
00:42:50,030 --> 00:42:52,730
when I hear like I don't really hear
that many people who are like, oh man.

866
00:42:52,731 --> 00:42:55,340
And then I tried to move my line
to the left on the histogram.

867
00:42:55,341 --> 00:42:58,260
Like it's not the same as like trying to
out cycle someone on the leader boards.

868
00:42:58,400 --> 00:43:01,760
And so in my mind now I think the
leaderboards are almost probably more

869
00:43:01,761 --> 00:43:02,870
important than the histograms.

870
00:43:02,871 --> 00:43:05,710
I don't know if it's going to like upset
like histogram fans out there as our,

871
00:43:05,720 --> 00:43:06,553
your histogram fan.

872
00:43:07,340 --> 00:43:10,700
Cause I have like I don't have
any friends who played your dance.

873
00:43:11,450 --> 00:43:15,070
You've got to fix that man. It's like
there's a name for this genre now, right?

874
00:43:16,790 --> 00:43:17,623
Fair

875
00:43:20,660 --> 00:43:23,940
tronics who's compete with each other.
I want to be at the top of the leaderboard

876
00:43:27,250 --> 00:43:31,950
histograms.
Not to try to move my line to the lab,

877
00:43:32,070 --> 00:43:33,660
but to see how far to look. Right. I am.

878
00:43:35,640 --> 00:43:40,640
I had the factory that I did horrible
hacky way and so my cycles graph is up

879
00:43:42,880 --> 00:43:44,200
there and I was like,
Ooh,

880
00:43:45,920 --> 00:43:49,210
yeah, that's, that's
something. Yeah, no, totally.

881
00:43:51,380 --> 00:43:54,350
We would never get rid of the histograms
because they're just too much fun.

882
00:43:54,380 --> 00:43:56,030
All right, I'm going to
syndicate. It gives you a,

883
00:43:56,090 --> 00:43:58,550
it gives you an insight and especially
because our players are so technical,

884
00:43:58,551 --> 00:44:02,420
they tried that and in histograms to
portal too and it failed utterly like it

885
00:44:02,421 --> 00:44:06,080
was just him. Does anybody remember
the histograms from Portal to Oh

886
00:44:07,600 --> 00:44:10,550
yeah. So you're the first person I've
ever met who even knew that they existed,

887
00:44:10,610 --> 00:44:13,280
which I guess means it was like
100% hit rate for being successful.

888
00:44:13,310 --> 00:44:16,460
But our theory on that
is that there are a lot,

889
00:44:16,490 --> 00:44:19,650
now I feel bad saying that there are less
effective cause you liked it but there

890
00:44:19,710 --> 00:44:22,130
it's not as,
it's hard to directly compete in,

891
00:44:22,131 --> 00:44:24,980
in a game like portal too cause you
can't just hit a play button to instantly

892
00:44:24,981 --> 00:44:28,650
replay your thing, your solution. And so
it, it doesn't quite have the same effect.

893
00:44:28,770 --> 00:44:31,770
Although there's tons of action games that
have scoreboards too. So I don't know,

894
00:44:31,800 --> 00:44:34,460
maybe maybe not enough people have tried.
Yup.

895
00:44:34,800 --> 00:44:37,360
When I was at valve I tried to convince
them like we should do a histogram.

896
00:44:37,380 --> 00:44:40,130
Like we should add histogram
support to the leaderboard service.

897
00:44:40,250 --> 00:44:44,010
But I would have had to cut it up myself.
I want to broken at all.

898
00:44:45,160 --> 00:44:48,200
Which game was the most fun to design
and create and which was least, oh

899
00:44:48,400 --> 00:44:51,490
that's I. Okay. So I saw that question
because I've seen all these events.

900
00:44:51,610 --> 00:44:52,690
I don't have an answer for that.

901
00:44:52,720 --> 00:44:56,320
I mean I would argue perhaps the least
fun games to create where the ones that

902
00:44:56,321 --> 00:44:58,930
we bailed on early and you
guys don't know about. Right.

903
00:44:58,931 --> 00:45:01,240
I'm very much like I only
make things when they're fun.

904
00:45:01,270 --> 00:45:04,030
We've definitely started working on games
that started off looking fun and then

905
00:45:04,031 --> 00:45:07,120
as I got into it I just hated it. And
then like when I hate when I'm working on,

906
00:45:07,121 --> 00:45:09,400
I hate my life and it just like
went down and I'm just like,

907
00:45:09,401 --> 00:45:11,020
I got to stop working on this game.
It's not good.

908
00:45:11,021 --> 00:45:13,390
And we've definitely pulled the plug
on a couple of projects cause it's just

909
00:45:13,391 --> 00:45:17,230
like, it's, it's just emotionally
unsatisfying and bed to work on it.

910
00:45:17,231 --> 00:45:20,380
Apparently I learned recently I have a
very strong aversion to recreating work

911
00:45:20,381 --> 00:45:23,380
that other people have done. Then making
games that feel like they're too much,

912
00:45:23,381 --> 00:45:26,670
just like, oh, like every other game
out there has this. And like we,

913
00:45:26,740 --> 00:45:30,220
I need to fucking spend like months and
months making the same kind of crap that

914
00:45:30,221 --> 00:45:32,920
everybody's making already and like
that apparently I don't like that.

915
00:45:34,180 --> 00:45:35,370
So yeah,

916
00:45:35,371 --> 00:45:40,371
out of my favorite game I Shinjin io was
really great because we had just like,

917
00:45:40,781 --> 00:45:43,240
we just moved into a new office.
We just started our team back up.

918
00:45:43,300 --> 00:45:46,390
We just painted the whole office and
read it because our landlord refused to.

919
00:45:46,600 --> 00:45:49,660
And, uh, and we started working on
this game and we're like, I'd already,

920
00:45:49,661 --> 00:45:52,210
I had already had so much time to kind
of like dream about it and like come up

921
00:45:52,211 --> 00:45:55,270
with all these ideas that we just were
able to just start working on it and it

922
00:45:55,271 --> 00:45:57,640
just like really clicked and it
was really satisfying and like,

923
00:45:57,641 --> 00:45:58,840
that's great when that happens.

924
00:45:59,140 --> 00:46:00,880
And so that was probably
the most fun we've had yet.

925
00:46:00,940 --> 00:46:03,640
But maybe that's just like a,
everything is always getting better thing.

926
00:46:05,280 --> 00:46:08,540
Um, yeah. So, uh, I have
sort of a corollary to the,

927
00:46:08,560 --> 00:46:11,300
the previous question that
I was a proxy for the, uh,

928
00:46:11,330 --> 00:46:13,430
the fun versus educational thing.

929
00:46:14,170 --> 00:46:17,960
But this is more about fun versus
productive or fun versus useful.

930
00:46:18,200 --> 00:46:21,020
So like a lot of the games that you've
made and in particular the ones I've been

931
00:46:21,021 --> 00:46:24,170
a fan of, like ts 100 and Jens
and I, oh. And Space Camp,

932
00:46:24,380 --> 00:46:26,150
you're doing some work,

933
00:46:26,151 --> 00:46:29,030
you have some tasks that you're supposed
to solve and it's an interesting

934
00:46:29,031 --> 00:46:31,250
problem solving challenge.
Um,

935
00:46:31,370 --> 00:46:35,630
have you thought about any ways to try
to somehow bring the fun that you've

936
00:46:35,631 --> 00:46:38,600
managed to create in those
games into more useful work?

937
00:46:38,690 --> 00:46:43,160
In terms of either like making our day
jobs as programmers more fun or making

938
00:46:43,161 --> 00:46:47,330
the fund that we engage in recreationally
more useful. Can it be done by you?

939
00:46:47,331 --> 00:46:49,400
Have any thoughts on what we
might do to make that happen?

940
00:46:49,940 --> 00:46:51,660
And I also asked this
as somebody who is like,

941
00:46:51,950 --> 00:46:55,310
obviously you have worked professional
corporate engineering jobs where it's

942
00:46:55,340 --> 00:46:59,570
maybe less fun than ideal, uh, for, you
know, your programming capabilities.

943
00:46:59,900 --> 00:47:02,540
I'm just curious if you had any
insight on what we might do to,

944
00:47:02,630 --> 00:47:03,463
to bridge that gap.

945
00:47:03,470 --> 00:47:05,060
So,
so this ties into sort of like,

946
00:47:05,061 --> 00:47:07,190
I used to think that games
were great for education.

947
00:47:07,191 --> 00:47:09,950
Now I think that games and education are
just game designers. They only hammer,

948
00:47:09,951 --> 00:47:10,850
they have as game design.

949
00:47:11,090 --> 00:47:13,040
And so everything looks like
a game that needs to be made.

950
00:47:13,250 --> 00:47:16,910
And I think that when I, I guess I don't
know anything about education honestly,

951
00:47:17,060 --> 00:47:20,180
but, um, when I, when I think about
how maybe we could improve it,

952
00:47:20,181 --> 00:47:23,980
it's not by bringing over games, but
by bringing over this idea of like, of,

953
00:47:23,981 --> 00:47:27,590
of fun and the idea that work can
and should be fun. Like if you're,

954
00:47:27,591 --> 00:47:31,180
especially if you're a kid and it
doesn't, right? Like you're, you're like,

955
00:47:31,200 --> 00:47:33,730
it's the, the home the way,
like, I mean there's, there's,

956
00:47:33,760 --> 00:47:36,430
I guess it's sort of an open question
about white people play and why play

957
00:47:36,431 --> 00:47:39,010
exists,
but the idea that play is how we learn.

958
00:47:39,250 --> 00:47:42,280
Like I think there's a lot of evidence
for that and like kind of trying to bring

959
00:47:42,281 --> 00:47:46,270
more play into, into learning,
right? I mean, I think that's a,

960
00:47:46,960 --> 00:47:49,660
I think that's a lofty goal, but I
don't really know if that makes sense.

961
00:47:49,661 --> 00:47:53,770
Or if you could apply that in any way.
Um, as for, for making work more fun.

962
00:47:54,900 --> 00:47:57,940
Oh God. I Dunno. I mean, so they've kind
of roll back into your question earlier.

963
00:47:58,200 --> 00:48:02,170
Um, the games that we make seem like
they are about real life things,

964
00:48:02,260 --> 00:48:05,260
they're kind of inspired by it,
but they're completely artificial.

965
00:48:05,470 --> 00:48:08,500
And I don't know,
I'm trying to think in,

966
00:48:08,501 --> 00:48:12,160
in Shinjin io like we completely changed
the way that synchronization works like

967
00:48:12,161 --> 00:48:15,100
a week before shipping because too many
of our play testers were stupid and

968
00:48:15,101 --> 00:48:15,934
couldn't understand it.

969
00:48:16,330 --> 00:48:19,770
And of course by that I mean it was not
a good system because when you're an

970
00:48:19,780 --> 00:48:22,750
assistant designer, if people don't
get it, it is 100% your fault.

971
00:48:23,020 --> 00:48:25,060
And we had to change it.

972
00:48:25,061 --> 00:48:27,820
And like if we were trying to make a
game that was about real life Arduinos,

973
00:48:27,821 --> 00:48:30,730
cause people need to know how
to program Arduinos right?

974
00:48:30,731 --> 00:48:33,420
When you can't change it, you just have
to kind of like hit a little harder. Like,

975
00:48:33,460 --> 00:48:36,010
oh we'll just put some more
tutorial text on there or something,

976
00:48:36,011 --> 00:48:37,060
which doesn't work by the way.

977
00:48:37,061 --> 00:48:40,300
Like the only way to make a game where
playable is just to make it more playable

978
00:48:40,420 --> 00:48:43,240
into redesign it until it is.
And so it's sort of like, uh,

979
00:48:43,870 --> 00:48:45,220
like the old saying about like,
you know,

980
00:48:45,221 --> 00:48:47,950
the way to win a battle is to
pick the right battle. Right.

981
00:48:47,951 --> 00:48:51,910
And that's very much what we do is that
we take on tasks when making these games

982
00:48:51,911 --> 00:48:53,350
we take on like it looks like work,

983
00:48:53,351 --> 00:48:55,870
but we're really taking on the tasks
that were, we think that we can win.

984
00:48:56,230 --> 00:48:59,140
And education, I think it's much harder
to do that because like you can't,

985
00:48:59,141 --> 00:49:03,040
you can't change anything about it. Like,
all you can do is like, like in, in our,

986
00:49:03,041 --> 00:49:05,380
in our stretch metabolism game,
when we ran into problems,

987
00:49:05,381 --> 00:49:09,640
we just kind of backed off
and like didn't, didn't
cover those topics. And, uh,

988
00:49:09,970 --> 00:49:11,150
I'm like,
you can't do that when,

989
00:49:11,151 --> 00:49:15,580
when you're supposed to be teaching
specific things. So my, my one grade Oh,

990
00:49:15,581 --> 00:49:17,240
you can do, can sit down, but yeah,

991
00:49:17,260 --> 00:49:21,540
I don't want to make you stand there just
to listen to me. Yeah. Yeah. Um, the,

992
00:49:21,541 --> 00:49:24,520
the one and the one idea of, I've seen
an education that seems really cool.

993
00:49:24,521 --> 00:49:24,851
And again,

994
00:49:24,851 --> 00:49:27,400
I say this is like a person who knows
nothing about education from a technical

995
00:49:27,430 --> 00:49:30,520
standpoint is the idea of um,

996
00:49:31,240 --> 00:49:33,130
like a cross curricular classes.

997
00:49:33,220 --> 00:49:36,520
So instead of saying you've math class
and you have history class and this is

998
00:49:36,521 --> 00:49:38,080
something they have at the,
there's a school,

999
00:49:38,081 --> 00:49:40,180
a charter school called quest to learn.
They have a few locations,

1000
00:49:40,270 --> 00:49:41,800
you have like a code breakers class.

1001
00:49:41,980 --> 00:49:44,530
We're codebreaker classes
about codes and breaking them.

1002
00:49:44,770 --> 00:49:46,150
And that's like what the class is about.

1003
00:49:46,210 --> 00:49:49,090
And of course that includes
math and history and like
you can't take a class and

1004
00:49:49,091 --> 00:49:49,900
not right,

1005
00:49:49,900 --> 00:49:52,180
but like it's about code breaking and
it's about something that you can get

1006
00:49:52,181 --> 00:49:56,350
excited about as opposed to an
abstract like group of tools,

1007
00:49:56,380 --> 00:49:57,460
which is not super fun.

1008
00:49:57,540 --> 00:49:59,710
And I think that's like a way
that you can kind of take like,

1009
00:49:59,770 --> 00:50:04,570
like games aren't like this is a like this
is a moving game, right? It's like no,

1010
00:50:04,571 --> 00:50:07,320
like games. Like if it's just about moving
like, and it's like what about shared?

1011
00:50:07,330 --> 00:50:09,850
No, it's just about
moving. Right? Like I said,

1012
00:50:09,851 --> 00:50:11,350
there are some games that
technically are that,

1013
00:50:11,351 --> 00:50:12,880
but that's not how you go
about designing a game.

1014
00:50:12,881 --> 00:50:15,360
Like you try to have like some emotional
resonance. You tried to make it so it's,

1015
00:50:15,550 --> 00:50:18,760
it's interesting you give people tasks
so when they like when something's too

1016
00:50:18,761 --> 00:50:20,950
hard,
they don't just have to like try harder.

1017
00:50:21,010 --> 00:50:22,900
They can kind of back off from that.
I was,

1018
00:50:22,901 --> 00:50:25,960
I was just talking to the Keith
and I still work with about,

1019
00:50:25,961 --> 00:50:27,470
we've been really into
heroes of the storm.

1020
00:50:27,800 --> 00:50:30,470
I put the games I play are
nothing like the games I make.

1021
00:50:30,471 --> 00:50:34,400
I am super low brow and my games and a
withhold I play and so we've been playing,

1022
00:50:34,401 --> 00:50:37,760
here's the storm, which is a Moba for
those of you don't know. And one of the,

1023
00:50:37,761 --> 00:50:42,230
apparently there was a talk by the lead
designer at league or the riot with

1024
00:50:42,231 --> 00:50:43,010
League of legends.

1025
00:50:43,010 --> 00:50:45,990
One of his philosophies is that you want
to have lots of different skills for

1026
00:50:45,991 --> 00:50:48,320
people to master so that when
like you get in a situation,

1027
00:50:48,321 --> 00:50:50,390
we're gonna like you keep trying to do
this thing and you just can't do it.

1028
00:50:50,390 --> 00:50:52,400
Cause you just don't have that skill
and you're not good enough yet,

1029
00:50:52,520 --> 00:50:54,740
you can back off and do
something else instead.

1030
00:50:54,920 --> 00:50:56,420
And like if you think about math class,

1031
00:50:56,421 --> 00:50:59,780
it doesn't allow you to kind of like
back off and do something that you can do

1032
00:50:59,781 --> 00:51:02,240
and gain mastery in a different area
and then come back. It's like, no,

1033
00:51:02,300 --> 00:51:04,430
we're just going to keep building
on it over and over again.

1034
00:51:04,431 --> 00:51:07,610
And if you miss one step, you are
out. And like that's how we do it.

1035
00:51:07,611 --> 00:51:09,740
And like that's a,
that's a very ungainly way to do that.

1036
00:51:09,741 --> 00:51:12,940
Like if that was a game that would be
a bad game. But because we don't like,

1037
00:51:13,000 --> 00:51:15,440
like we, we say like, oh we want
to bring games into classes.

1038
00:51:15,441 --> 00:51:17,770
Not that we want to bring
lessons from games into classes.

1039
00:51:17,780 --> 00:51:19,640
I'm going to stop ranting about that
cause I don't know what I'm talking about.

1040
00:51:19,670 --> 00:51:20,503
So,

1041
00:51:22,700 --> 00:51:23,030
uh,

1042
00:51:23,030 --> 00:51:28,030
so the exact term games I've been playing
are often about developing solutions

1043
00:51:29,360 --> 00:51:34,330
for like a fixed problem and everybody's
kind of graded against the, the same, uh,

1044
00:51:34,340 --> 00:51:38,580
criteria I, he'd have like
their compared, um, you know,

1045
00:51:38,920 --> 00:51:42,530
like indirectly if you have
metrics, completion time and
everything like that. Uh,

1046
00:51:42,560 --> 00:51:46,520
what do you think about games were
like players solutions can compete or

1047
00:51:46,521 --> 00:51:50,780
cooperate directly with one another.
So it's not so much the, you know,

1048
00:51:50,781 --> 00:51:53,900
the environment and like a fixed
puzzle, but rather, you know,

1049
00:51:54,400 --> 00:51:57,530
you know how they interact
and that's a good idea.

1050
00:51:59,390 --> 00:52:00,640
I've ever heard of the rubber wars.

1051
00:52:00,780 --> 00:52:03,530
Oh yes. Oh yes. No, I'm
definitely familiar with a
lot of those kinds of things.

1052
00:52:03,531 --> 00:52:06,120
Yeah. That's, that's, that is
something that, that intrigues us.

1053
00:52:07,270 --> 00:52:07,960
Hmm.

1054
00:52:07,960 --> 00:52:11,800
Maybe if you're lucky. Yes. It
takes a while and make games.

1055
00:52:11,801 --> 00:52:15,640
That's the hardest part. And
so I, I would, I would love
to make a game like that.

1056
00:52:15,830 --> 00:52:20,600
Hmm. So we're probably
gonna have to wrap up soon.

1057
00:52:20,601 --> 00:52:22,970
So we're just going to end up with the,
with the question that we deferred,

1058
00:52:22,971 --> 00:52:26,660
which is what has been the most surprising
or unexpected thing until two 30

1059
00:52:26,661 --> 00:52:27,494
right?

1060
00:52:28,620 --> 00:52:30,350
It's in two 30 on this.
Okay.

1061
00:52:30,360 --> 00:52:34,110
So we have the room reserved
for cleanup afterwards. Okay.

1062
00:52:34,111 --> 00:52:35,700
Well we can start
cleaning off while I talk.

1063
00:52:36,430 --> 00:52:38,050
So I wanted to show you guys
something really quickly,

1064
00:52:38,160 --> 00:52:40,320
which is the secret origin
and Zach tronics games.

1065
00:52:44,490 --> 00:52:48,880
It's just j flap. Has Anybody used
this before? Yeah. You look excited.

1066
00:52:49,060 --> 00:52:49,850
So I,

1067
00:52:49,850 --> 00:52:53,560
in college I took a class about like
models of computation and computational

1068
00:52:53,561 --> 00:52:57,670
theory and one of the exercises that
we got repeatedly was like, you know,

1069
00:52:57,671 --> 00:53:02,230
like implement a push, like a, like
an autonomous automata automata for,

1070
00:53:02,290 --> 00:53:05,370
um, that, that satisfies these
things and accepts and rejects the,

1071
00:53:05,371 --> 00:53:08,740
is these different things and build a
Turing machine. This is that tronics game,

1072
00:53:08,741 --> 00:53:09,461
right?
I mean there's actually,

1073
00:53:09,461 --> 00:53:11,560
I came out there by somebody
else called manufact Toria,

1074
00:53:11,620 --> 00:53:14,980
which is literally about turning your
shins, but like this idea of like,

1075
00:53:15,440 --> 00:53:15,730
okay,

1076
00:53:15,730 --> 00:53:17,170
here's the set of criteria.

1077
00:53:17,320 --> 00:53:20,920
Here's a completely open space where you
can design something that's technical

1078
00:53:20,921 --> 00:53:25,590
and kind of computation knee
but not literally programming
and have it like meet

1079
00:53:25,620 --> 00:53:29,160
these criteria over here. And I think a
lot of people who make programming games,

1080
00:53:29,161 --> 00:53:32,430
they never, they never got to
experience the beauty of Jay flap. Uh,

1081
00:53:32,610 --> 00:53:35,460
and they just thought, oh, I have
to write code and then do this.

1082
00:53:35,461 --> 00:53:38,040
And I think the thing that really like
this really tapped into something deep in

1083
00:53:38,041 --> 00:53:38,530
my psyche,

1084
00:53:38,530 --> 00:53:41,940
the idea that like you can build these
things that aren't code but are symbolic

1085
00:53:41,941 --> 00:53:46,170
or mechanical or processes and still
apply the sort of programmatic like

1086
00:53:46,171 --> 00:53:47,010
criteria to them.

1087
00:53:47,330 --> 00:53:51,390
And so that's the hidden,
that's the hidden origin of
Zach tronics games. There's,

1088
00:53:52,230 --> 00:53:56,240
I wrote this and I have no idea
what any of this means. I, yeah,

1089
00:53:56,610 --> 00:53:58,320
I don't remember anything
from od comp yet.

1090
00:53:58,350 --> 00:54:01,110
It was still like the most
important class I took in college.

1091
00:54:01,430 --> 00:54:02,590
So,
um,

1092
00:54:08,350 --> 00:54:11,950
oh God. Yeah, that was just talking
about Java. But yeah, that was, yeah.

1093
00:54:11,980 --> 00:54:15,310
So I'm going to blast it. Do this and
like three minutes apparently. So,

1094
00:54:15,311 --> 00:54:17,680
so we get surprised by your
players. A lot of times, um,

1095
00:54:17,920 --> 00:54:20,850
people build an impressive things,
obviously, like everybody's seeing like,

1096
00:54:20,851 --> 00:54:22,330
like red standing computers in Minecraft,

1097
00:54:22,331 --> 00:54:25,210
like that kind of thing of people just
building something that's surprising or

1098
00:54:25,211 --> 00:54:27,340
not surprising, but just
like impressive. Um,

1099
00:54:27,400 --> 00:54:30,250
sometimes at our games people discover
unintentional mechanics and exploit them

1100
00:54:30,251 --> 00:54:32,950
to great depth, right? Like
that's, that's a fun thing.

1101
00:54:33,070 --> 00:54:35,380
And sometimes people just find
out new ways to play our games.

1102
00:54:35,620 --> 00:54:39,790
So I showed you this about
the origin of histograms. Um,

1103
00:54:40,630 --> 00:54:42,700
this is also where solution
sharing and space, Kim,

1104
00:54:42,910 --> 00:54:45,670
it really looks like this as youtube
videos. But before that we were like, oh,

1105
00:54:45,671 --> 00:54:48,040
what if it was like a website that it
generated and you could click on it and

1106
00:54:48,041 --> 00:54:51,430
stuff. It turns out you look at this, you
have no idea what's going on here. Right?

1107
00:54:51,460 --> 00:54:52,780
I don't know what's going on there.
I mean,

1108
00:54:52,781 --> 00:54:54,520
technically I guess that's
a solution to a puzzle.

1109
00:54:54,550 --> 00:54:57,340
But that was why the
video came about. And, uh,

1110
00:54:57,341 --> 00:54:59,680
and that was back when it was like super
hard to record a video without like a

1111
00:54:59,690 --> 00:55:04,610
codex. And, uh, management
network and construed door.
And you'll see the first, uh,

1112
00:55:04,900 --> 00:55:09,550
the first universal solution that you can
buy, like connecting up the wires here.

1113
00:55:09,551 --> 00:55:10,810
You can build like any,

1114
00:55:10,811 --> 00:55:14,650
you can just replicate any
set of output universally.

1115
00:55:14,860 --> 00:55:18,430
And so this, this leads to something
we call a Volkswagen thing. Now,

1116
00:55:18,431 --> 00:55:20,350
after people did this to
great degree in Schengen area,

1117
00:55:20,351 --> 00:55:22,960
which is where you say to hell
with what it's supposed to do,

1118
00:55:23,080 --> 00:55:26,110
let's she and like just get the right
output, you know, like the right,

1119
00:55:26,330 --> 00:55:29,420
the right criteria for the
test. So that's, that's,

1120
00:55:29,440 --> 00:55:33,270
that's somebody else's term that's
not mine. Um, and an infant, a minor,

1121
00:55:33,271 --> 00:55:35,070
we were surprised by or players,
uh,

1122
00:55:35,080 --> 00:55:37,510
I built in front of my
kind of play like TF two,

1123
00:55:37,511 --> 00:55:39,550
like it has teams and classes and stuff.

1124
00:55:39,551 --> 00:55:42,430
I didn't know anything about game design
that all of our players realize that

1125
00:55:42,431 --> 00:55:44,600
it's more fun just to build
shit. That's cool. And,

1126
00:55:44,601 --> 00:55:47,440
and this would be a thing where our
players innovated and we're just like, ah,

1127
00:55:47,441 --> 00:55:48,790
I don't know what to do.
Right.

1128
00:55:49,000 --> 00:55:53,050
And sometimes being at like the being at
ground zero is like the worst place to

1129
00:55:53,051 --> 00:55:55,510
see what's going on right where you are.
And that's definitely,

1130
00:55:55,511 --> 00:55:59,830
I think what happened with within the
minor, um, with space cam, we have some,

1131
00:55:59,890 --> 00:56:04,450
oh that looks terrible. So, um, so this
is like a stall, the stall of Waldo.

1132
00:56:04,451 --> 00:56:07,010
These are techniques that we had no idea
where possible until we ship the game

1133
00:56:07,011 --> 00:56:09,790
and people started doing them where if
you just put it in a structure like this

1134
00:56:09,791 --> 00:56:10,510
and have you just run off,

1135
00:56:10,510 --> 00:56:13,390
it'll just repeatedly execute that which
it turns out is really cheap from like

1136
00:56:13,391 --> 00:56:17,500
a a score perspective.
There's also like a,

1137
00:56:17,501 --> 00:56:20,710
I didn't even think this was possible,
but at a strictly linear solution.

1138
00:56:23,020 --> 00:56:24,100
Don't know if you guys
have seen that before,

1139
00:56:24,100 --> 00:56:28,090
but that's pretty cool. Um, and people
figuring out the worst example of this,

1140
00:56:28,091 --> 00:56:30,370
this is kind of like these are
fun, right? Like this is cool.

1141
00:56:30,371 --> 00:56:31,780
Somebody figure out something clever.
Uh,

1142
00:56:31,781 --> 00:56:35,020
when people figured out how our bonding
algorithm worked and that each bonder

1143
00:56:35,021 --> 00:56:37,630
was technically in like a
sorted list somewhere in memory.

1144
00:56:37,631 --> 00:56:39,070
And that if you figured out the order,

1145
00:56:39,071 --> 00:56:41,620
you could control the order
precisely in ways we didn't intend.

1146
00:56:42,030 --> 00:56:45,160
This is a problem that continually bites
us. Something asked over and over again,

1147
00:56:45,280 --> 00:56:48,780
which is that like should something
be deterministic or should it be non

1148
00:56:48,781 --> 00:56:50,530
deterministic and if
it's non deterministic,

1149
00:56:50,531 --> 00:56:52,210
how do we convey that
it's non deterministic?

1150
00:56:52,390 --> 00:56:54,720
This would be probably mentioned
and I know that intention io,

1151
00:56:54,760 --> 00:56:58,600
when you run a solution,
every time you run that same test run,

1152
00:56:58,690 --> 00:57:01,420
it's deterministic.
But when you get to the next test run,

1153
00:57:01,510 --> 00:57:04,430
it's technically not deterministic
from the last one. So, uh, this,

1154
00:57:04,450 --> 00:57:07,030
this happens all the time. We added logic
gates. People are like, oh I'm clever,

1155
00:57:07,031 --> 00:57:08,380
I'm going to go flip flops.
Right?

1156
00:57:08,410 --> 00:57:11,440
So they built a non deterministic flip
flop that if they like took like a class

1157
00:57:11,441 --> 00:57:12,221
in electrical engineering,

1158
00:57:12,221 --> 00:57:15,190
they know it was done terministic but
because they run the same test run over

1159
00:57:15,191 --> 00:57:18,400
and over again, it's deterministic. It
always initialized as the top at first.

1160
00:57:18,520 --> 00:57:19,301
And then they get to test one,

1161
00:57:19,301 --> 00:57:21,830
two and suddenly it's the bottom one
and they're just like, this is good.

1162
00:57:21,840 --> 00:57:23,770
This is a bug in your game.
I get so many emails and they're like,

1163
00:57:23,771 --> 00:57:24,760
this is bugging your game. It's like, no,

1164
00:57:24,761 --> 00:57:27,330
it's just like part of it's deterministic
and part of it's not and it's,

1165
00:57:27,331 --> 00:57:30,160
it's super complicated. Can I
have like five more minutes? Okay.

1166
00:57:30,460 --> 00:57:32,800
You guys can leave if you
need to. That's cool. Um,

1167
00:57:33,040 --> 00:57:35,710
so this is the greatest thing that
anybody's ever made for any of our games,

1168
00:57:35,860 --> 00:57:38,470
which this is a homemade,
like they made it by hand.

1169
00:57:38,471 --> 00:57:43,180
It's a looping animated Gif and we were
going to do youtube video uploads for

1170
00:57:43,181 --> 00:57:44,014
infinity factory.

1171
00:57:44,170 --> 00:57:48,130
And this was like 2013 when like everybody
was getting really into animated gifs

1172
00:57:48,131 --> 00:57:51,460
again and uh,
and they made this and it just,

1173
00:57:51,490 --> 00:57:53,940
Oh you can't talk cause you can't
actually put animated gifs in PowerPoint.

1174
00:57:53,950 --> 00:57:58,810
It turns out. And uh, and so
like they made this gift and
I'm just like, oh my God,

1175
00:57:58,811 --> 00:58:00,430
this is the greatest thing
I've ever seen in my life.

1176
00:58:00,431 --> 00:58:02,530
And so within like a day
I took our youtube thing,

1177
00:58:02,531 --> 00:58:05,860
just ripped out all of the video stuff
that we were planning to do and made it

1178
00:58:05,861 --> 00:58:07,390
spit out animated gifs instead.

1179
00:58:07,480 --> 00:58:10,480
And it was the most genius thing we ever
did because then everybody just shared

1180
00:58:10,481 --> 00:58:13,270
animated gifs with all their friends and
they like because of the factory loop,

1181
00:58:13,271 --> 00:58:15,730
we can make the gifts loop
seamlessly and it's fucking amazing.

1182
00:58:15,870 --> 00:58:19,150
It was my favorite thing.
So here you can see some techniques.

1183
00:58:19,151 --> 00:58:20,050
So you actually see,

1184
00:58:20,100 --> 00:58:23,290
you can see some techniques that people
discovered that I really didn't intend

1185
00:58:23,291 --> 00:58:25,810
and kind of built like with like you
can't do anything about it is that rope.

1186
00:58:26,450 --> 00:58:29,140
Damn it.
See if this put it in me,

1187
00:58:29,150 --> 00:58:33,040
it gets us the Bz so pretty that rotating
things as quicker than moving them on

1188
00:58:33,041 --> 00:58:35,740
conveyors because of like
how rotating things work.

1189
00:58:36,040 --> 00:58:37,960
And then people also
use this to build giant,

1190
00:58:38,140 --> 00:58:41,020
giant rotating arms where they'll
just have these arms that just swing

1191
00:58:41,021 --> 00:58:43,810
effortlessly in one cycle
back and forth across the map.

1192
00:58:44,680 --> 00:58:47,350
Like to the point where when
people keep their own like, uh,

1193
00:58:47,380 --> 00:58:50,470
like high score list with other
people they like on, on, on Reddit,

1194
00:58:50,471 --> 00:58:52,700
they do this for all of our games because
we don't have an official high score

1195
00:58:52,710 --> 00:58:55,120
list cause I don't want to be responsible
for making sure people aren't cheating,

1196
00:58:55,420 --> 00:58:57,910
that they'll say like,
here's your best score,

1197
00:58:57,940 --> 00:59:00,460
here's your best score without
giant rotate our arms. Right.

1198
00:59:00,660 --> 00:59:02,200
Like it's a huge problem.

1199
00:59:02,460 --> 00:59:04,870
But like we couldn't do anything
about it cause it's just kind of weed.

1200
00:59:04,871 --> 00:59:08,650
That was the game we made. Like, um,

1201
00:59:08,950 --> 00:59:12,260
we also had somebody who,
um, they, this is a pro,

1202
00:59:12,460 --> 00:59:15,160
this is a puzzle where you're supposed
to build a machine that you can drive to

1203
00:59:15,161 --> 00:59:17,560
like fight off the battle at spoiler
alert. At the end of the game,

1204
00:59:18,160 --> 00:59:21,440
somebody built like a
completely autonomous solution
that like perfectly like

1205
00:59:21,441 --> 00:59:25,460
100%. So the, the battle. So like I
didn't even think that was possible,

1206
00:59:25,461 --> 00:59:30,050
but there they are doing it.
Oh wait, wait, what? Oh Shit.

1207
00:59:30,380 --> 00:59:33,440
What's, what's your, what's
your youtube name? Okay.

1208
00:59:33,500 --> 00:59:37,700
So there might be more stuffing
from you. I don't know. Um, okay.

1209
00:59:38,210 --> 00:59:40,830
So um, so this is a, uh,

1210
00:59:41,070 --> 00:59:45,530
you can tell like it's a whatever degree
you call the [inaudible] for that.

1211
00:59:45,560 --> 00:59:48,960
A couple people made these, um,
somebody bought a typewriter.

1212
00:59:49,050 --> 00:59:51,320
Like it's getting to the point where I
don't even know like, cause all sorts of,

1213
00:59:51,530 --> 00:59:52,790
there's all sorts of cool things that I,

1214
00:59:52,791 --> 00:59:55,250
in theory I understand you can do
in the game. Like you can build,

1215
00:59:56,000 --> 01:00:00,500
you can build physical structures that
are data because of like their physical,

1216
01:00:00,501 --> 01:00:04,730
right? And so I'm guessing that's like
a matrix of like things that encode the

1217
01:00:04,731 --> 01:00:07,520
different characters, right? This dude,

1218
01:00:07,790 --> 01:00:10,580
like almost all of these videos are
from this guy gtw one, two, three.

1219
01:00:10,581 --> 01:00:11,530
So you build a typewriter,

1220
01:00:11,820 --> 01:00:15,050
but any build a calculator which uses
the same kind of method for printing.

1221
01:00:15,230 --> 01:00:18,380
The crazy thing is it actually
supports a ton of precision because it,

1222
01:00:18,390 --> 01:00:22,220
I'm going to skip ahead really
quickly. You can see it, it builds,

1223
01:00:22,221 --> 01:00:23,330
it does it physically.

1224
01:00:27,420 --> 01:00:28,350
I think you guys can see here this guy,

1225
01:00:28,351 --> 01:00:30,010
because he's going to
build this number and it,

1226
01:00:30,011 --> 01:00:32,010
it just kind of builds it
as like a stack of blocks.

1227
01:00:32,011 --> 01:00:34,440
And then the way you add them as you
just smash them together and let it like

1228
01:00:34,441 --> 01:00:39,180
physically carry over and
stopped. So it's pretty cool. Um,

1229
01:00:39,390 --> 01:00:41,980
he also implemented tis 100 and an infant.
Yeah.

1230
01:00:44,240 --> 01:00:45,073
So

1231
01:00:47,340 --> 01:00:52,020
as far cleverer than I am. So I'm,
the code of the program is locked in,

1232
01:00:52,021 --> 01:00:54,420
but it is reprogrammable
and it's really execute.

1233
01:00:54,421 --> 01:00:56,670
Like I don't even know how
the fuck do you do this?

1234
01:00:59,740 --> 01:01:00,210
Yeah,

1235
01:01:00,210 --> 01:01:02,490
you consider it hungry?
I don't know.

1236
01:01:02,491 --> 01:01:04,800
I don't want this person
writing code for my games.

1237
01:01:05,130 --> 01:01:05,963
Right.

1238
01:01:08,860 --> 01:01:10,900
Um, so there, there's a little bit of,

1239
01:01:10,930 --> 01:01:13,290
these are all going to TRS
is boring by comparison. Uh,

1240
01:01:13,390 --> 01:01:15,520
so we had this instruction called Jro,
right.

1241
01:01:15,521 --> 01:01:17,840
Which lets you just arbitrarily
tell one node where to jump.

1242
01:01:18,190 --> 01:01:20,830
One node can tell another node were how
to jump and it's like you can do the

1243
01:01:20,831 --> 01:01:24,970
same things with it. The problem is
that that doesn't look cool, right?

1244
01:01:25,740 --> 01:01:30,070
Like does anybody know what this is? This
code? Yeah. So this is the quick three,

1245
01:01:30,071 --> 01:01:33,900
like fast inverse, square root thing that
like, it's, it's like infamous code. It's,

1246
01:01:33,980 --> 01:01:37,440
it's, it's, it's really hard to tell how
this does an inverse square root. Um,

1247
01:01:37,540 --> 01:01:40,900
but it's great code and it's great
solutions for ts 100 look like this.

1248
01:01:40,901 --> 01:01:43,840
It's like as it best, like you can tell,
there's a comment here that just says,

1249
01:01:43,841 --> 01:01:46,510
what the fuck? So like, you know
that something weird is going on.

1250
01:01:46,510 --> 01:01:49,180
Like you don't even get that
on task because there's not
room for such a comment.

1251
01:01:49,570 --> 01:01:54,010
So like good t I s solutions don't
look any different than a bad one.

1252
01:01:55,090 --> 01:01:57,970
Some people built little fun things like
this generates amazed that you can walk

1253
01:01:57,971 --> 01:02:02,120
around in, but that's about it. Uh,

1254
01:02:02,620 --> 01:02:06,220
a lot of people built emulators for TSL
hundred. I guess that's kind of cool.

1255
01:02:06,221 --> 01:02:06,521
Like,

1256
01:02:06,521 --> 01:02:09,790
like there was surprising number of people
who made emulators for Canada's 100,

1257
01:02:10,000 --> 01:02:13,330
which I guess is how program we're going
to interact with stuff as to try to

1258
01:02:13,331 --> 01:02:17,140
emulate it has some fun stuff
and sound going to come through.

1259
01:02:22,100 --> 01:02:26,590
MMM,
okay.

1260
01:02:26,600 --> 01:02:29,370
So the, Oh, I can hear myself going
through that. That's what's going on.

1261
01:02:29,371 --> 01:02:32,570
That's confusing. Um, I'm
going to try to, okay. Um,

1262
01:02:32,610 --> 01:02:35,330
can we link to the microphone
into the computer? Does that work?

1263
01:02:35,340 --> 01:02:37,980
We'll try it in a second. So this is one
of those people who bought a flip flop.

1264
01:02:37,981 --> 01:02:41,040
That's not a terministic
they, uh, they think it is.

1265
01:02:41,260 --> 01:02:45,050
Um,
well that does seem like an error.

1266
01:02:45,560 --> 01:02:48,590
That was just supposed to
be funny. Okay, here we go.

1267
01:02:49,970 --> 01:02:51,020
So here

1268
01:02:51,370 --> 01:02:54,280
somebody built a game of life.

1269
01:02:54,810 --> 01:02:58,330
Like these are just things that I
didn't even like. I guess that works.

1270
01:02:58,331 --> 01:03:00,400
Like evidently it works. I
don't know how it works. Right.

1271
01:03:00,401 --> 01:03:03,580
And there's a bunch of that we shouldn't
and I know the best ones are the music

1272
01:03:03,581 --> 01:03:05,170
player ones.
So we're going to try this.

1273
01:03:11,300 --> 01:03:11,510
Yup.

1274
01:03:11,510 --> 01:03:14,510
That's just going to be feedback. That's
not gonna work. Um, this play music,

1275
01:03:14,511 --> 01:03:17,640
which is hilarious. If we could,
you could hear it. So, uh, that,

1276
01:03:17,641 --> 01:03:21,340
that kind of doesn't work.
What's that joke? Um,

1277
01:03:21,680 --> 01:03:24,740
so here's the last thing I'll show you.
So somebody built a,

1278
01:03:25,370 --> 01:03:30,230
a three d maze or you can
like walk around. This means,

1279
01:03:30,500 --> 01:03:32,990
and the way that they couldn't
actually store the maze anywhere.

1280
01:03:32,991 --> 01:03:37,130
So it like it algorithmically generates
the same maize every time because

1281
01:03:37,131 --> 01:03:38,510
otherwise you just wouldn't go to fit it.
Right.

1282
01:03:38,511 --> 01:03:40,900
And so all the crazies engineered
solutions have this train.

1283
01:03:40,920 --> 01:03:44,360
Like you just can't even tell how
they work. And it's, it's like magic,

1284
01:03:46,340 --> 01:03:48,170
but there's no fun mechanics
to discover in that game.

1285
01:03:48,470 --> 01:03:51,890
So I think the giant rotator arms are
probably the best for what somebody has

1286
01:03:51,891 --> 01:03:55,100
done. So that was another quick
thing that I show you guys.

1287
01:03:55,180 --> 01:03:58,820
Somebody asked about the s 100 patches
and so that was totally inspired by

1288
01:03:58,821 --> 01:04:01,120
Activision. Used to give away.
I get, I don't know if they,

1289
01:04:01,121 --> 01:04:01,881
you had to send him money,

1290
01:04:01,881 --> 01:04:06,440
but if you photographed yourself getting
a high score in a m and it would a game

1291
01:04:06,470 --> 01:04:09,380
and like next to the TV or whatever and
then you send them the photo and then

1292
01:04:09,381 --> 01:04:11,060
they'd send you back a patch
so you could like join,

1293
01:04:11,061 --> 01:04:14,240
they're like high score club or whatever.
And so I saw this and was like, yes,

1294
01:04:14,241 --> 01:04:16,130
we need to do this for,
for like Infinera factory.

1295
01:04:16,310 --> 01:04:19,160
And so that's where like the first 100
the first 100 people to beat all of the

1296
01:04:19,161 --> 01:04:22,480
puzzles in the first part of the
game, got a patch and a, and it was,

1297
01:04:22,481 --> 01:04:26,920
it was pretty cool. Yeah. I
guess we should start off then.

1298
01:04:26,960 --> 01:04:30,950
Does anybody else have any questions?
We have time rate.

1299
01:04:32,600 --> 01:04:34,520
Thank you for coming here.
Round of applause.

1300
01:04:34,680 --> 01:04:37,680
[inaudible].
