1
00:00:05,600 --> 00:00:07,970
So it's my pleasure to
introduce Arielle Berry,

2
00:00:08,060 --> 00:00:11,240
who is the founder and CEO of Mobile Odt.

3
00:00:11,390 --> 00:00:16,390
He's here to talk about catching
cancer using AI enabled smartphones.

4
00:00:16,491 --> 00:00:20,840
A round of applause for him please.
Thank you very much. Thank you

5
00:00:21,540 --> 00:00:25,110
everybody. And thank you so much for
joining me today and for inviting me.

6
00:00:25,111 --> 00:00:28,710
Thank you Ilana for this wonderful
opportunity to share with you a little bit

7
00:00:28,711 --> 00:00:29,760
about what we're doing.

8
00:00:29,761 --> 00:00:34,761
And my goal for today is to share with
you a bit of what is possible using

9
00:00:37,530 --> 00:00:41,580
today's technologies. Um, not
so much from the technical side,

10
00:00:41,581 --> 00:00:43,490
but more from the structural side.

11
00:00:43,530 --> 00:00:45,450
I'm happy to speak
afterwards during the Q and,

12
00:00:45,451 --> 00:00:47,670
a if you have want to go
a little bit deeper, but,

13
00:00:47,710 --> 00:00:52,710
but what I would love to speak with you
about today specifically is about health

14
00:00:52,931 --> 00:00:56,520
care and,
and on a fundamental level,

15
00:00:57,360 --> 00:01:02,360
what health care requires more
than anything else is information.

16
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:06,360
So, um, when I started, uh,

17
00:01:06,390 --> 00:01:08,820
Mobile Ott together with
my cofounder David Levitz,

18
00:01:08,821 --> 00:01:13,821
one of the things that we were
struggling with was we had on one hand,

19
00:01:14,401 --> 00:01:15,234
it's technology,

20
00:01:15,450 --> 00:01:18,900
which was a under understanding
their consumer electronic devices.

21
00:01:18,900 --> 00:01:23,900
We're getting so much better thanks to
the rise in mobile phones and we had a

22
00:01:25,351 --> 00:01:29,130
need out there. Um, we
identified that cervical cancer,

23
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:30,570
which we'll speak about in a bit,

24
00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:34,020
is a leading cause of death for women
in rural areas around the world.

25
00:01:34,380 --> 00:01:36,510
And it was so easily treatable.

26
00:01:37,410 --> 00:01:42,410
But connecting the two was the question
that we faced and what we realize this

27
00:01:42,451 --> 00:01:43,750
is part of the,
uh,

28
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:47,280
the conversation that we had with some
of the world's leading public health

29
00:01:47,281 --> 00:01:51,690
organizations around the world was that
in the end on the most fundamental level

30
00:01:52,270 --> 00:01:56,340
healthcare and the provision of
good healthcare depends on data.

31
00:01:56,640 --> 00:01:59,970
And that's something that all of you
and definitely Google knows a lot about.

32
00:02:00,810 --> 00:02:04,230
So if I can leave you with two things
at the end of this presentation,

33
00:02:04,740 --> 00:02:09,740
the first one is that health care
depends on information on data.

34
00:02:10,380 --> 00:02:14,310
And then the second thing is that
mobile computing will make healthcare

35
00:02:14,340 --> 00:02:16,920
accessible to every person on the planet.

36
00:02:17,370 --> 00:02:21,450
So with those two particular things,
I'd love to jump into the presentation,

37
00:02:21,451 --> 00:02:25,200
share a little bit about what we do
and then hopefully engage with you in

38
00:02:25,210 --> 00:02:29,640
conversation about how you might be
able to use your superpowers in terms of

39
00:02:29,641 --> 00:02:32,550
your abilities as engineers,
as business people,

40
00:02:32,700 --> 00:02:37,110
as operations people to save as
many lives as quickly as possible.

41
00:02:38,760 --> 00:02:40,980
So I'll step back.
My name is Arielle Berry.

42
00:02:41,220 --> 00:02:44,220
I have the absolute pleasure to be here
today to represent a company called

43
00:02:44,221 --> 00:02:47,520
Mobile Odt mobile optical
detection technologies.

44
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:53,000
And what we do on the most fundamental
level is use the power of mobile phones

45
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:55,860
to address disease.

46
00:02:56,340 --> 00:02:59,040
Now there are a lot of different ways
that mobile phones can be used to address

47
00:02:59,050 --> 00:02:59,800
disease.

48
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:04,800
Some companies use apps that consumers
will use to track their blood sugar or

49
00:03:05,290 --> 00:03:08,170
their blood pressure and
intervene on a daily basis.

50
00:03:08,450 --> 00:03:13,450
What what we believe as a company and
where we're seeking to contribute is in

51
00:03:13,511 --> 00:03:14,344
prevention.

52
00:03:14,650 --> 00:03:19,650
So good healthcare is best suited
to do preventable diseases,

53
00:03:19,991 --> 00:03:21,340
right?
If you can catch a disease,

54
00:03:21,370 --> 00:03:23,980
almost any disease while
it's early enough to treat,

55
00:03:24,340 --> 00:03:29,140
you can clearly and quickly treat
it before a person gets to ill.

56
00:03:29,650 --> 00:03:33,280
And so you can save years of personal
lives and thousands of dollars and

57
00:03:33,281 --> 00:03:36,970
families going into debt just by
identifying disease early enough.

58
00:03:37,420 --> 00:03:42,420
And we believe that the people who are
best suited to currently empower with

59
00:03:42,791 --> 00:03:45,130
such technology is our health
care workers. And our mission,

60
00:03:45,640 --> 00:03:50,320
our mission as a company is
to equip healthcare workers,
the nurses, the midwives,

61
00:03:50,350 --> 00:03:51,161
the technicians,

62
00:03:51,161 --> 00:03:55,780
the clinicians that are out there serving
the majority of humanity on a daily

63
00:03:55,781 --> 00:04:00,781
basis to equip them with the tools that
they need to be able to provide better

64
00:04:01,721 --> 00:04:02,554
care.

65
00:04:03,310 --> 00:04:07,150
And if we look at that as a mission,

66
00:04:07,151 --> 00:04:11,110
then the question becomes as a company,
where can we make the most impact?

67
00:04:11,110 --> 00:04:13,280
And so we decided,
um,

68
00:04:13,300 --> 00:04:18,300
to take dedicated caregivers to provide
them with mobile compute labs and to

69
00:04:19,721 --> 00:04:24,721
help them make an evolutionary jump in
their ability to provide health care

70
00:04:25,301 --> 00:04:28,360
quality,
particularly in cervical cancer.

71
00:04:29,140 --> 00:04:31,300
So many of you already know this,

72
00:04:31,301 --> 00:04:33,640
but I just want to make sure
that we're all on the same page.

73
00:04:33,790 --> 00:04:38,790
Cervical cancer is a leading cause of
death for women in rural areas around the

74
00:04:38,951 --> 00:04:39,784
world.

75
00:04:40,030 --> 00:04:45,030
It's a cause of death that is in many
ways the most tragic because the most

76
00:04:45,101 --> 00:04:49,360
preventable, I'll show you in a little
bit how cervical cancer develops,

77
00:04:49,361 --> 00:04:51,190
but just on on one foot,

78
00:04:51,460 --> 00:04:54,160
cervical cancer can take up
to 20 years to kill a patient.

79
00:04:54,760 --> 00:04:58,360
It comes from an infectious disease,
the HPV, the human papilloma virus,

80
00:04:58,390 --> 00:05:01,060
and if you catch it within
the first five years,

81
00:05:01,330 --> 00:05:05,740
you can treat it on the spot with
basically the equipment you have in the

82
00:05:05,741 --> 00:05:09,850
kitchen for less than 28 bucks
and less than 20 minutes.

83
00:05:10,450 --> 00:05:15,450
So how can it be that a disease that is
easier to cure than the flu is killing

84
00:05:16,480 --> 00:05:20,800
millions of women to decade mothers,
pillars of their community? How?

85
00:05:20,801 --> 00:05:24,490
How is that possible? It's actually
one of the fascinating things.

86
00:05:24,491 --> 00:05:29,380
It's because women aren't screened.
So every woman,

87
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:34,000
every single woman of reproductive age
should be screened for cervical cancer

88
00:05:34,001 --> 00:05:37,180
regularly, whether it be every
three years or every five years,

89
00:05:37,181 --> 00:05:39,520
depending on the technologies
that we have available.

90
00:05:40,030 --> 00:05:43,450
And yet the majority of women
around the world aren't.

91
00:05:45,340 --> 00:05:49,240
And all it has to do is that one moment
of screening and that one moment of

92
00:05:49,241 --> 00:05:52,960
identification of disease in which a
woman's life can go from the death column

93
00:05:53,290 --> 00:05:55,540
two, the life calmed. Now,

94
00:05:55,541 --> 00:05:59,690
what's fascinating is that despite the
investment in maternal and child health,

95
00:05:59,691 --> 00:06:01,760
since 2015 since recently,

96
00:06:01,880 --> 00:06:06,590
cervical cancer deaths have become more
prevalent than deaths from maternal and

97
00:06:06,591 --> 00:06:07,580
child complications.

98
00:06:07,760 --> 00:06:10,820
So it's one of those things where it's
just a little bit of investment in

99
00:06:10,821 --> 00:06:15,380
regular screening can mean millions
of women alive to take care of their

100
00:06:15,381 --> 00:06:20,030
families. And that's not a problem
just around the world's problem.

101
00:06:20,031 --> 00:06:24,860
Also in America, almost every person in
reproductive age in this room, for sure,

102
00:06:24,890 --> 00:06:28,550
and many of the people who'll be watching
online will at some point in their

103
00:06:28,551 --> 00:06:30,530
life contract the HPV virus.

104
00:06:31,070 --> 00:06:34,880
Human Papilloma virus is one of
the more popular viruses today,

105
00:06:35,180 --> 00:06:38,930
and 79 million Americans are
living with it at this moment.

106
00:06:39,530 --> 00:06:42,080
And what that virus does
is it infects the cells.

107
00:06:42,680 --> 00:06:47,360
The cells that are infected with high
risk strains of that virus will start to

108
00:06:47,390 --> 00:06:51,710
become inflamed, and then
they will develop a disease.
And if you catch it early,

109
00:06:51,711 --> 00:06:54,590
treat it. And if the body's immune
system can, can flush it out,

110
00:06:54,591 --> 00:06:57,770
it'll flush it out.
Just like we flush out viruses every day.

111
00:06:58,280 --> 00:07:02,870
But for some Americans, and for many
women around the world, the kills them.

112
00:07:04,010 --> 00:07:07,370
Now, the way it works is as follows,
and apologies for the graphic images,

113
00:07:07,371 --> 00:07:10,370
but I think it's important to recognize
because it is a visually accessible

114
00:07:10,371 --> 00:07:13,940
disease. So a normal cervix, the cervix,

115
00:07:13,941 --> 00:07:17,620
just for everyone who I learned
this when I started, uh,

116
00:07:17,780 --> 00:07:21,650
at mobility of the cervix is where the
baby comes out through, right? So it's,

117
00:07:21,651 --> 00:07:26,090
it's, it's part of the woman's anatomy
and the cervix, a normal cervix is, uh,

118
00:07:26,300 --> 00:07:31,040
is fleshy and has squamous cell and uh,

119
00:07:31,041 --> 00:07:35,600
and Kolmar sells. I asked.
The virus infects those cells,

120
00:07:35,601 --> 00:07:40,580
they start to become inflamed and
visibly on the surface of the cervix,

121
00:07:40,760 --> 00:07:45,760
you start to see signs that that infection
is becoming is beginning to grow.

122
00:07:46,520 --> 00:07:50,000
Right at that stage at precancerous stage,

123
00:07:50,001 --> 00:07:52,940
you can still just cut out those cells,

124
00:07:53,270 --> 00:07:55,540
literally freeze them
out or burn the mountain.

125
00:07:55,550 --> 00:07:58,940
A procedure that can take
a few minutes using very,

126
00:07:58,941 --> 00:08:01,970
very simple technology
that can be done anywhere,

127
00:08:02,510 --> 00:08:04,700
literally anywhere around the world.

128
00:08:05,240 --> 00:08:07,730
And that woman will go from the
death column two, the life calm.

129
00:08:08,330 --> 00:08:09,740
But if you let it persist,

130
00:08:09,770 --> 00:08:14,750
then infection continues and those
cells invade, then you get cancer.

131
00:08:14,751 --> 00:08:18,110
And at that stage it is almost
impossible to save a woman's life.

132
00:08:19,490 --> 00:08:24,490
So you have this very long process that
can take up to 20 years where from a

133
00:08:25,131 --> 00:08:28,970
normal cervix to a precancerous cervix,
you have a five year window.

134
00:08:29,330 --> 00:08:33,920
And even during that period of
precancer you can still treat easily.

135
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:40,120
Now what's fascinating is that
screening is only part of the problem.

136
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:44,280
So anyone who looks at
graphs will generally look
at this graph and say, well,

137
00:08:44,281 --> 00:08:45,770
wait a second, the trends
are going down, but I want,

138
00:08:45,771 --> 00:08:49,640
what I want you to notice is that
from around the year 2000 until today,

139
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:53,900
despite the fact that we've introduced
tremendous technological leaps in

140
00:08:53,901 --> 00:08:57,570
cervical cancer screening,
liquid based cytology,

141
00:08:58,080 --> 00:09:01,080
HPV testing, and most
importantly, the vaccine,

142
00:09:01,980 --> 00:09:05,940
the number of deaths and the number
of new cases have basically flatlined,

143
00:09:06,980 --> 00:09:10,230
right? They have not gone to zero,
which is what you'd imagine, right?

144
00:09:10,231 --> 00:09:12,690
All of a sudden we're vaccinating
people and we're screening with better

145
00:09:12,691 --> 00:09:15,630
technologies and we're
intervening when we can. No,

146
00:09:15,690 --> 00:09:20,640
we're still seeing thousands of women
develop the disease and thousands of women

147
00:09:20,641 --> 00:09:22,710
die from the disease in America.

148
00:09:23,430 --> 00:09:26,850
Forget outside of the United States
where those rates are growing every year

149
00:09:26,851 --> 00:09:30,540
because infection rates are, are growing.
So the question then becomes, all right,

150
00:09:30,541 --> 00:09:32,730
so we have all these
wonderful technologies,

151
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:35,520
liquid based cytology and
HPV testing and vaccination,

152
00:09:35,700 --> 00:09:38,730
and hopefully everyone in the,
everyone listened to here is vaccinated.

153
00:09:39,960 --> 00:09:41,490
Why is this technology?

154
00:09:41,491 --> 00:09:46,491
Why are we not yet able to stop
such a simply stoppable disease?

155
00:09:46,710 --> 00:09:49,170
Well has to do with lack of experts.

156
00:09:49,650 --> 00:09:52,980
So I like showing the map of the United
States as opposed to the map of India or

157
00:09:52,981 --> 00:09:56,460
China or Africa because it's so striking.

158
00:09:56,820 --> 00:10:01,170
The red is where there
are zero gynecologists.

159
00:10:02,690 --> 00:10:05,150
These are counties of the
United States of America,

160
00:10:05,151 --> 00:10:09,170
one of arguably the most developed and
economically successful countries in the

161
00:10:09,171 --> 00:10:13,790
world.
And that is the map of lack of expertise.

162
00:10:14,330 --> 00:10:17,660
So if you catch the disease,
what are you going to go?

163
00:10:18,740 --> 00:10:19,573
Okay,

164
00:10:19,590 --> 00:10:21,850
let me tell you something that's actually
fascinating. When I learned that I,

165
00:10:21,851 --> 00:10:26,560
it blew my mind, 25% of
women, one quarter of women,

166
00:10:26,561 --> 00:10:31,561
one out of four women who were called up
and told you have a positive high grade

167
00:10:33,821 --> 00:10:38,440
lesion from your pap smear,
you need to come in and get treated.

168
00:10:39,370 --> 00:10:41,500
Do not return.

169
00:10:43,550 --> 00:10:45,890
Half of women who were called up and said,

170
00:10:45,891 --> 00:10:50,240
you have a high grade HPV test,
high risk HPV at us.

171
00:10:50,241 --> 00:10:54,890
You got to come in for your next, for
your next appointment. Don't come in.

172
00:10:55,700 --> 00:11:00,110
And the question is why? Because
the distance. And so the,

173
00:11:00,111 --> 00:11:03,710
and again this is an America where you
have great roads and you have Amtrak and

174
00:11:03,711 --> 00:11:07,550
you have buses and you have the
ability to get places in theory, right?

175
00:11:07,551 --> 00:11:12,020
Forget rural Africa or rural India,
rural Southeast Asia.

176
00:11:12,290 --> 00:11:14,000
So the,
the problem,

177
00:11:14,001 --> 00:11:19,001
the challenge is the connection of
the patient and the expert and that's,

178
00:11:19,570 --> 00:11:20,900
that's what we sought to address.
So,

179
00:11:20,930 --> 00:11:24,080
so this is the enhanced visual
assessment system. This is eva.

180
00:11:24,890 --> 00:11:28,760
Eva is built around the technology
that all of us, no one love

181
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:32,450
the android mobile phone,
right?

182
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:36,980
The amazing thing about the technology
that this company that Google has

183
00:11:36,981 --> 00:11:41,600
contributed so much towards and that
we as consumers have supported and its

184
00:11:41,601 --> 00:11:46,601
growth is that it's become so powerful
and its ability to capture images,

185
00:11:47,540 --> 00:11:52,310
process and analyze those images and
communicate with a world of expertise that

186
00:11:52,311 --> 00:11:53,980
is on the Internet,
right?

187
00:11:54,040 --> 00:11:57,370
The things that we know and love from
everyday interactions are actually

188
00:11:57,371 --> 00:12:01,300
critical to health care provision.
And what that means is that those nurses,

189
00:12:01,301 --> 00:12:02,081
those midwives,

190
00:12:02,081 --> 00:12:06,790
those technicians that do see the
majority of humanity by using a device,

191
00:12:06,791 --> 00:12:11,791
a medical device of FDA cleared CE marked
medical device that was enhances the

192
00:12:12,191 --> 00:12:17,191
power of the mobile phone can now provide
expert treatment wherever that woman

193
00:12:18,641 --> 00:12:22,780
is. So anywhere that you can take your
phone, you can take any of his system,

194
00:12:23,230 --> 00:12:27,040
but obviously it's not just the mobile
phone and it's not just the device,

195
00:12:27,250 --> 00:12:32,230
it's that what eva does and devices
like it, connected devices like it is,

196
00:12:32,231 --> 00:12:35,920
it connects the cloud to the patient at
the point of care and it connects the

197
00:12:35,921 --> 00:12:37,750
patient or the point of
care and the provider,

198
00:12:37,780 --> 00:12:40,690
the healthcare provider at the
point of care to the cloud.

199
00:12:41,710 --> 00:12:45,280
And that's what's so powerful
about the moment that we're in.

200
00:12:45,280 --> 00:12:49,750
And that's why there's such a moment of
potential for all of us to contribute.

201
00:12:50,200 --> 00:12:55,200
Because once we recognize that in essence
solving healthcare challenges is a

202
00:12:56,290 --> 00:12:57,940
solving a data problem.

203
00:12:58,300 --> 00:13:02,650
It means that every time
that we impact health care,

204
00:13:03,700 --> 00:13:08,700
we can literally transform the way that
healthcare services are provided through

205
00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:12,670
connecting dots,
through connecting pieces of information.

206
00:13:13,480 --> 00:13:16,790
Now we've learned this and, and
I, I'm, I'm going to stop the,

207
00:13:16,791 --> 00:13:18,340
the mobile Lutie t segment for a second.

208
00:13:18,341 --> 00:13:22,660
We've learned this by working nine
to 29 countries around the world,

209
00:13:22,690 --> 00:13:24,010
a lot in the United States,

210
00:13:24,011 --> 00:13:26,560
but around the world as well
on the African continent,

211
00:13:26,561 --> 00:13:30,670
in areas of the world in which
cell phones are relatively new.

212
00:13:30,671 --> 00:13:31,930
But thanks to the,
uh,

213
00:13:31,931 --> 00:13:36,220
unbelievable power of mobile devices
basically can be taken anywhere.

214
00:13:37,300 --> 00:13:39,580
And what we've learned in
all of those countries,

215
00:13:39,581 --> 00:13:43,870
whether it be in the most advanced
cities in the United States and India,

216
00:13:43,871 --> 00:13:48,610
or whether it be an in the most remote
areas across the African continent or in

217
00:13:48,611 --> 00:13:51,850
Latin America, what we've learned, um,

218
00:13:52,260 --> 00:13:54,220
rather than the question
that we've asked though is,

219
00:13:54,430 --> 00:13:58,600
is how can mobile computing
really transform healthcare?

220
00:13:58,810 --> 00:14:01,300
And what we've learned is that it
can do so in three different ways.

221
00:14:02,230 --> 00:14:07,210
So specifically, um, what I'm
going to posit here today and, and,

222
00:14:07,270 --> 00:14:11,200
and the, the requests that I'm going to
end up making at the end of this is that

223
00:14:11,201 --> 00:14:16,201
specifically mobile computing can
help three means of intervention for

224
00:14:16,520 --> 00:14:21,280
healthcare. It can help in one
identifying patients at risk. In our case,

225
00:14:21,281 --> 00:14:24,700
because we're still use cervical
cancer as our, as our case study here,

226
00:14:24,790 --> 00:14:27,250
it can identify women at risk too.

227
00:14:27,580 --> 00:14:32,580
It can ensure that a poor appropriate
treatment is applied and three is that it

228
00:14:33,221 --> 00:14:34,720
can show unsure adherence.

229
00:14:34,721 --> 00:14:38,230
They can make sure that the woman who
was told that she's positive is treated

230
00:14:38,231 --> 00:14:41,290
correctly and then it's followed up
with correctly so that cancer doesn't

231
00:14:41,291 --> 00:14:44,890
continue to become an issue.
So let's go into those three quickly.

232
00:14:45,850 --> 00:14:49,870
First it can. I, uh, mobile computing
can help identify women at risk.

233
00:14:49,870 --> 00:14:53,030
This is a scatter plot of data that was,
uh,

234
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:57,830
was analyzed as part of a Kaggle
hosted competition that Genentech,

235
00:14:57,831 --> 00:15:01,520
a large pharmaceutical company made
available using symphony's data sets,

236
00:15:01,580 --> 00:15:05,300
symphonies, a large data aggregator
here in the United States.

237
00:15:05,690 --> 00:15:09,620
And what the competition requested was
for data science teams to look at this

238
00:15:09,621 --> 00:15:13,670
large public data set and identify
based on this large public data set,

239
00:15:13,850 --> 00:15:16,850
which women are at risk
for cervical cancer.

240
00:15:17,300 --> 00:15:19,070
And they found an accuracy of,

241
00:15:19,100 --> 00:15:23,720
I think it's over 90% and identifying high
risk women just from public data sets.

242
00:15:24,350 --> 00:15:26,000
Now why is this important?
Well,

243
00:15:26,001 --> 00:15:31,001
because the United States spends about
six point $6 billion every year screening

244
00:15:32,060 --> 00:15:35,420
women for cervical cancer,
six point $6 billion.

245
00:15:35,660 --> 00:15:40,660
55 million women are screened every
year and yet 10 million women are not.

246
00:15:42,210 --> 00:15:44,310
And out of those 55 million women,

247
00:15:44,910 --> 00:15:47,760
only 30 million women
should actually be screened.

248
00:15:48,780 --> 00:15:49,270
Okay.

249
00:15:49,270 --> 00:15:54,100
So you're basically screening 25 million
women who do not need to be screened

250
00:15:54,610 --> 00:15:58,990
and you're not screening 10 million
women at highest risk that do need to be

251
00:15:58,991 --> 00:15:59,650
screened.

252
00:15:59,650 --> 00:16:02,830
And that's why African American and
Hispanic women in the United States have

253
00:16:02,831 --> 00:16:07,240
rates of cervical cancer that are almost
equivalent in some places higher than

254
00:16:07,270 --> 00:16:09,460
women in Africa and
women in Latin America.

255
00:16:10,570 --> 00:16:14,170
Because we're not screening the women
that need to be screened and we're

256
00:16:14,171 --> 00:16:16,360
overscreening the women that
don't need to be screened.

257
00:16:16,840 --> 00:16:19,150
That's just the data issue.
It's just the data problem.

258
00:16:19,210 --> 00:16:22,160
It's something that can be
rather straight forward solve.

259
00:16:22,170 --> 00:16:25,900
And once you have that information and
you can reallocate resources accordingly

260
00:16:25,901 --> 00:16:30,010
and you ensure that the right care
is going to the right patients,

261
00:16:30,460 --> 00:16:33,490
then you can make the right decisions
as to who needs to be taken care of.

262
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:37,900
So that first one is just identifying
the women that need to be screened.

263
00:16:38,830 --> 00:16:40,570
The second one is applying
the appropriate treatment.

264
00:16:40,840 --> 00:16:45,840
This is the basic workflow
for how cervical cancer
screening works in the United

265
00:16:45,910 --> 00:16:49,420
States today. And it's the same thing with
the pap smear as well as the HPV test.

266
00:16:49,630 --> 00:16:53,980
So let's go through it rather quickly.
Woman comes into a doctor's office,

267
00:16:54,070 --> 00:16:58,120
she lies on the table, the providers
scrape, sells off the cervix,

268
00:16:58,240 --> 00:17:01,210
puts a little bucket, closes that
bucket, gives us a medical assistant.

269
00:17:01,210 --> 00:17:03,940
Medical assistant, takes it and
brings it into the front corner.

270
00:17:04,030 --> 00:17:07,060
They call logistics company logistics
company comes in, picks up the buckets,

271
00:17:07,061 --> 00:17:10,000
takes them to a lab lab than unloads it,
brings it to the technician,

272
00:17:10,001 --> 00:17:12,790
technician then takes it,
stains it after they stay in it,

273
00:17:12,791 --> 00:17:14,500
they didn't take it and
put it under a microscope.

274
00:17:14,501 --> 00:17:17,830
They look under the microscope or they
look under it as part of an essay to look

275
00:17:17,831 --> 00:17:20,050
whether there is presence
of HPV DNA there.

276
00:17:20,060 --> 00:17:23,410
Then identify whether or not that woman
has had something that is high risk.

277
00:17:23,560 --> 00:17:28,240
They then write that down. That then gets
oftentimes faxed back to the provider.

278
00:17:28,270 --> 00:17:29,810
The medical assistant takes that facts,

279
00:17:29,930 --> 00:17:32,830
looks at the medical record types and
information into the medical record.

280
00:17:32,980 --> 00:17:35,290
If it's positive,
then it goes and talks to the doctor,

281
00:17:35,410 --> 00:17:37,150
the doctor that it needs
to make a decision. Hm,

282
00:17:37,390 --> 00:17:40,820
maybe I'll call back that patient. And
then the medical assistant calls up the,

283
00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:45,880
the patient and the patient three weeks
later after she had that test taken,

284
00:17:46,870 --> 00:17:50,890
needs to be rescheduled.
Little Bit complicated, right?

285
00:17:52,140 --> 00:17:56,880
So that tire period of time for those
three weeks after a patient has come in

286
00:17:57,120 --> 00:17:59,820
and gotten the test taken,
she doesn't know.

287
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:04,830
And oftentimes wage workers role,
Americans,

288
00:18:05,220 --> 00:18:08,010
single parents have a
hard time of scheduling.

289
00:18:08,011 --> 00:18:10,740
That next fall they just moved mountains
to be able to have their annual

290
00:18:10,741 --> 00:18:14,910
physical. So they get a call and they say
to and and the medical assistant says,

291
00:18:14,911 --> 00:18:18,850
listen ma'am, you've gotten a positive
pap smear. And the woman says, all right,

292
00:18:18,860 --> 00:18:21,720
I'll, I'll, I'll call you back when
I can reschedule. I'm at work now.

293
00:18:22,350 --> 00:18:25,020
And then she has a million things
that she needs to do when she forgets.

294
00:18:25,650 --> 00:18:28,980
And that's why I added the six point
$6 billion that we spend every year

295
00:18:29,010 --> 00:18:30,570
screening women in the United States.

296
00:18:30,690 --> 00:18:35,520
1.2 billion of that are due
to nonadherence to women
that are lost to followup

297
00:18:35,640 --> 00:18:38,370
because she wasn't able to
schedule that next visit in time.

298
00:18:38,370 --> 00:18:41,370
And then she comes back the next year
and she's positive again and she says,

299
00:18:41,400 --> 00:18:43,860
Oh God,
you told me last year I was positive.

300
00:18:44,070 --> 00:18:47,250
And then they need to schedule
again but they don't all come.

301
00:18:47,790 --> 00:18:52,790
And so that long process leads to women
going from the life column to the death

302
00:18:53,371 --> 00:18:54,204
calm.

303
00:18:54,570 --> 00:18:58,800
Now what we're doing at mobile and it
is what we've found is that you can

304
00:18:58,801 --> 00:19:02,370
replace that whole process of collecting
the sample, sending it to the lab,

305
00:19:02,371 --> 00:19:07,140
and then bring in the woman back for
the next step through applying pretty

306
00:19:07,141 --> 00:19:11,280
fundamental machine learning algorithms
to the images that you capture using a

307
00:19:11,281 --> 00:19:12,114
colposcope.

308
00:19:12,420 --> 00:19:15,930
So there's some fascinating groundbreaking
work that will be published pretty

309
00:19:15,931 --> 00:19:17,610
shortly that I'm not allowed
to talk about too much,

310
00:19:17,611 --> 00:19:21,360
but I'll try to share the basics of in
which the National Cancer Institute and

311
00:19:21,361 --> 00:19:25,620
the National Library of medicine have
done extraordinary work to prove that our

312
00:19:25,621 --> 00:19:29,520
partners that global good have been
able to identify cervical cancer with an

313
00:19:29,521 --> 00:19:31,380
accuracy pretty high,

314
00:19:31,780 --> 00:19:35,430
a little over 90% just
on a single image alone.

315
00:19:36,120 --> 00:19:40,500
And that is extraordinary because what
that means is that while the woman's in

316
00:19:40,710 --> 00:19:45,710
the clinic without her going and going
through that entire process and 0.6

317
00:19:45,991 --> 00:19:49,470
seconds, she can go from the
death column to the life calm.

318
00:19:51,800 --> 00:19:53,090
And that's just the beginning,
right?

319
00:19:53,091 --> 00:19:56,360
Because what's fascinating
is that these algorithms,

320
00:19:56,720 --> 00:19:59,420
because remember cervical cancer,
just like many other diseases,

321
00:19:59,430 --> 00:20:00,470
visually assessable,

322
00:20:00,650 --> 00:20:04,790
these algorithms and we already know and
love and a deploy on an almost everyday

323
00:20:04,791 --> 00:20:05,624
basis,

324
00:20:05,660 --> 00:20:09,470
many of you in this room probably write
those algorithms and they're based on

325
00:20:09,471 --> 00:20:14,060
cafe, on tensor flow. Now we're moving
towards tensorflow lite. There's simple,

326
00:20:14,100 --> 00:20:17,240
straightforward machine learning problems.
Interestingly enough,

327
00:20:17,241 --> 00:20:19,010
computer vision didn't
really cut it there,

328
00:20:19,250 --> 00:20:21,740
but when you build a
large enough data set,

329
00:20:21,860 --> 00:20:26,660
and currently mobile Ott is proud to
have large data sets in the world on

330
00:20:26,661 --> 00:20:27,321
cervical cancer,

331
00:20:27,321 --> 00:20:31,490
you can use that to identify disease at
its earliest stages using nothing more

332
00:20:31,820 --> 00:20:36,140
than a visual image. So that that has to
do with applying appropriate treatment.

333
00:20:36,141 --> 00:20:39,560
Because if you can apply that treatment
on the point of care at that moment when

334
00:20:39,561 --> 00:20:40,400
the woman's in the room,

335
00:20:41,060 --> 00:20:43,940
you can do so much more for
that woman than anything else.

336
00:20:44,120 --> 00:20:48,850
But then once you apply that term and
you need to make sure that she's actually

337
00:20:48,851 --> 00:20:51,130
taken care of, right? So
the patient examination,

338
00:20:51,131 --> 00:20:53,920
which most medical devices do pretty well,

339
00:20:54,160 --> 00:20:58,300
is only a very small link in the chain
to ensure the patients are kept healthy

340
00:20:58,780 --> 00:21:03,220
because after that woman is examined and
we need to communicate with that woman

341
00:21:03,460 --> 00:21:07,570
what it was that was seen and what
it is that she needs to do and if the

342
00:21:07,571 --> 00:21:09,310
appropriate treatment isn't there.

343
00:21:09,490 --> 00:21:12,460
If it's not for cervical cancer or it
could be for any other type of disease,

344
00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:15,790
she needs to be referred
and once she's referred,

345
00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:19,600
then we need to make sure that we
update her record because if we're not

346
00:21:19,660 --> 00:21:22,570
expressing to the other person
what it is that you saw,

347
00:21:22,810 --> 00:21:25,150
then they might miss
it because in the end,

348
00:21:25,270 --> 00:21:28,690
clinicians are only human right and they
only know what to look for if they're

349
00:21:28,691 --> 00:21:29,770
told what to look for.
Again,

350
00:21:29,771 --> 00:21:34,390
it's a problem of data and once that
patient record is updated and the provider

351
00:21:34,391 --> 00:21:35,950
provides the appropriate treatment,

352
00:21:36,310 --> 00:21:40,420
then you want to take that information
and you want to warehouse it because you

353
00:21:40,421 --> 00:21:44,890
want to have information about how disease
spreads within a population. Remember,

354
00:21:45,010 --> 00:21:47,320
cervical cancer is a communicable disease.

355
00:21:47,321 --> 00:21:51,220
It comes from the human papilloma virus
and there's so many other diseases like

356
00:21:51,221 --> 00:21:52,630
that.
If you can find trends,

357
00:21:52,780 --> 00:21:56,620
you can know how to allocate resources
effectively and then once you have that

358
00:21:56,621 --> 00:21:56,981
data,

359
00:21:56,981 --> 00:22:00,880
you can start identifying patients and
then once you identify those patients and

360
00:22:00,881 --> 00:22:01,810
you need to examine them,

361
00:22:01,811 --> 00:22:06,811
and that continuum is what makes
healthcare and that continuum is a data

362
00:22:09,371 --> 00:22:11,830
problem.
It's a communication problem.

363
00:22:11,860 --> 00:22:14,380
It's a problem that we've
solved in social networks,

364
00:22:14,470 --> 00:22:16,810
but we haven't yet solved in healthcare,

365
00:22:17,500 --> 00:22:19,930
but we can now.

366
00:22:20,410 --> 00:22:25,410
So for that there are three things that
to close off the more frontal part of

367
00:22:26,261 --> 00:22:27,940
this and to start our conversation,

368
00:22:27,941 --> 00:22:29,860
there are three things
that I would ask of you.

369
00:22:30,550 --> 00:22:35,550
Have all of you here and all of you that
you know that have those super powers

370
00:22:36,041 --> 00:22:39,490
that you're applying at Google and that
you're applying in all of your work

371
00:22:39,760 --> 00:22:43,210
outside of it.
First is let's,

372
00:22:44,260 --> 00:22:48,760
let's help us, let's help the healthcare
system identify patients at risk, right?

373
00:22:49,060 --> 00:22:54,060
Let's take public data sets and identify
how we can more clearly map vectors and

374
00:22:55,871 --> 00:22:59,230
then express that information to health
care organizations so that they can

375
00:22:59,231 --> 00:23:04,150
deploy the proper resources and the most
effective and efficient manner so that

376
00:23:04,151 --> 00:23:08,530
those healthcare organizations can do
what they do best and care for patients.

377
00:23:10,390 --> 00:23:13,930
Let's also apply the
appropriate treatment devices.

378
00:23:14,020 --> 00:23:18,880
Have a huge amount of data exhaust and
obviously if you have garbage coming in,

379
00:23:18,881 --> 00:23:21,530
you have garbage coming out.
And that's why for mobility tea,

380
00:23:21,700 --> 00:23:25,630
we believe that the critical component
is ensuring that you have control over

381
00:23:25,631 --> 00:23:29,620
the type of information that comes in
so that you can apply the appropriate

382
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:32,740
information that comes out for analysis.

383
00:23:32,920 --> 00:23:37,920
So let's connect more
devices to the cloud.

384
00:23:39,550 --> 00:23:43,960
Do it with all the proper unnecessary
security precautions to ensure the patient

385
00:23:43,961 --> 00:23:46,790
privacy is kept,
but you identify a woman from her cervix,

386
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:51,620
nor can you identify a man from
his or for annual cancer or uh,

387
00:23:51,680 --> 00:23:54,470
or any person from their,
uh, from their skin disease.

388
00:23:54,650 --> 00:23:59,240
Let's use that information so that
any provider, anywhere, any nurse,

389
00:23:59,241 --> 00:24:02,480
any midwife, any technician that can take
a mobile phone and bring it into the,

390
00:24:02,600 --> 00:24:03,433
into the field,

391
00:24:03,650 --> 00:24:08,650
let's make sure that every member of
humanity has the same access to the same

392
00:24:09,321 --> 00:24:14,321
high level diagnostic accuracy just by
ensuring that they all have access to the

393
00:24:14,361 --> 00:24:18,740
right information. And then
finally, let's ensure adherence.

394
00:24:19,430 --> 00:24:24,260
We've learned so much about
social dynamics over the
past decade alone and yet

395
00:24:24,380 --> 00:24:28,040
we're not doing a very good job of
ensuring that that woman that gets called

396
00:24:28,050 --> 00:24:32,000
[inaudible] told that she
has high grade precancer,

397
00:24:33,230 --> 00:24:34,910
we're not doing the job,
bring her back.

398
00:24:35,900 --> 00:24:39,560
How is it that we're able to get her
to order stuff on, on, on online shops,

399
00:24:39,561 --> 00:24:43,430
but we're not able to get her to come
back to a clinic or get the clinic to her.

400
00:24:44,270 --> 00:24:47,600
We understand the social costs of
having mothers die in their, in their,

401
00:24:47,630 --> 00:24:50,360
in their most important ages.
Let's intervene.

402
00:24:51,170 --> 00:24:55,860
So figuring out how to do that, that's,
that's a data problem. And so the,

403
00:24:55,900 --> 00:25:00,020
the key,
the key here is to do the examination,

404
00:25:00,560 --> 00:25:05,560
the analysis and enable the
action immediately at the
point of care to do that

405
00:25:07,281 --> 00:25:11,740
calculation fast to do it
wherever it is that that happens,

406
00:25:11,750 --> 00:25:16,750
that the patient is to bring health
care to wherever the sick are.

407
00:25:17,390 --> 00:25:21,410
And that's where mobile devices are so
powerful because they go wherever we are

408
00:25:22,160 --> 00:25:24,470
and almost every person
on the planet now has one.

409
00:25:25,910 --> 00:25:30,910
Now we're doing our part mobility t by
taking the same technology that sits at

410
00:25:31,221 --> 00:25:32,870
the heart of this device,

411
00:25:33,260 --> 00:25:37,280
enabling a mobile phone to be turned
into a medical device and applying it in

412
00:25:37,281 --> 00:25:39,320
other diseases that are
visually assessable.

413
00:25:39,790 --> 00:25:43,040
Anything that you can identify with your
eye that a clinician identifies from

414
00:25:43,041 --> 00:25:45,500
endoscopic procedures to,
to skin,

415
00:25:46,730 --> 00:25:49,790
you should be able to do with a mobile
device. You just need to tweak it.

416
00:25:49,850 --> 00:25:53,600
So using the right optics,
the right illumination, the
right structures and so on.

417
00:25:54,500 --> 00:25:56,060
But there's so many other ways to do it.

418
00:25:56,570 --> 00:26:01,250
And we're hoping that every device
company, that every technology provider,

419
00:26:01,251 --> 00:26:05,900
we'll start thinking about how they can
use their core resources to ensure that

420
00:26:05,901 --> 00:26:10,220
their technologies are being used
to save lives at the point of care.

421
00:26:11,780 --> 00:26:13,520
And just the last thought,
once again,

422
00:26:13,820 --> 00:26:18,820
is that data is critical and it's the
mobile element that enables that data to

423
00:26:20,151 --> 00:26:21,170
be actionable.

424
00:26:21,740 --> 00:26:26,740
So all of us here have that
native understanding just
because we use our phones

425
00:26:27,831 --> 00:26:28,664
every day.

426
00:26:28,760 --> 00:26:33,020
So let's use them for something that
ends up saving a life that might be

427
00:26:33,021 --> 00:26:34,040
otherwise lost.

428
00:26:35,480 --> 00:26:39,470
Thank you all very much and I hope
that you join us in making healthcare

429
00:26:39,471 --> 00:26:42,800
accessible to every person on the planet.
And I welcome your questions.

430
00:26:49,390 --> 00:26:52,170
So there are two, uh, I was asked to
say there are two microphones, uh,

431
00:26:52,210 --> 00:26:54,970
there are eliminated by the spotlights.
If you have any question at all,

432
00:26:54,971 --> 00:26:59,450
I'd be happy to answer them. Um,
and no question. Is that a balance?

433
00:27:04,490 --> 00:27:07,990
Hi, thanks a lot for the talk.
Um, so I have two questions. Um,

434
00:27:08,180 --> 00:27:11,570
the first is you mentioned the
accuracy is around like, uh,

435
00:27:12,110 --> 00:27:13,550
a little bit higher than 90%.

436
00:27:13,551 --> 00:27:18,200
Can you talk about like
maybe the breakdown of that
in the sense of are there

437
00:27:18,201 --> 00:27:20,330
false positives or false negatives?

438
00:27:20,580 --> 00:27:22,020
Absolutely. So, um,

439
00:27:22,980 --> 00:27:25,910
there are a number of papers
that I could refer you to the,

440
00:27:25,911 --> 00:27:30,660
the seminal paper that will be coming
out soon. We'll break down a lot further.

441
00:27:30,661 --> 00:27:30,921
What,

442
00:27:30,921 --> 00:27:35,921
what I can say about it is that what's
fascinating about the cervix is that it's

443
00:27:36,810 --> 00:27:37,643
a,

444
00:27:37,700 --> 00:27:41,910
a pretty clear example of
squamous cell carcinoma,

445
00:27:42,270 --> 00:27:44,520
which means that as the
cells start to proliferate,

446
00:27:44,521 --> 00:27:48,630
they start to show visibility.
Now you will get false negatives,

447
00:27:48,780 --> 00:27:51,090
but the sensitivity and
specificity are both above 90,

448
00:27:51,120 --> 00:27:55,680
which means that you will know that you're
seeing something and you will more or

449
00:27:55,681 --> 00:27:59,040
less know that that thing
is cancer right now.

450
00:27:59,370 --> 00:28:02,820
To compare that to the pap smear to HPV,
HPV,

451
00:28:02,821 --> 00:28:06,990
Katcha HPV testing catches a ton of
people who have the higher restrain that

452
00:28:06,991 --> 00:28:10,800
will never develop into cancer because
only 5% of the people who have a high

453
00:28:10,801 --> 00:28:13,920
restraint of HPV actually will
end up developing the cancer.

454
00:28:14,340 --> 00:28:17,520
And the test just looks for
the strain of HPV DNA. Right?

455
00:28:17,970 --> 00:28:22,950
What a visual examination does is it
looks for when the cells are already

456
00:28:22,951 --> 00:28:27,480
growing and that's when you want to, you
want to, you want to nip the bud, right?

457
00:28:27,481 --> 00:28:31,630
You want to take away those cells
where the infection occurs. And in,

458
00:28:31,700 --> 00:28:36,390
as far as the literature shows, now
around 97% of cases, it'll never reinfect.

459
00:28:37,620 --> 00:28:38,080
Thank you.

460
00:28:38,080 --> 00:28:42,220
Um, and I guess the second
question, this is, I'm, um,

461
00:28:42,490 --> 00:28:46,950
so the common, um, I guess
barrier with healthcare is,

462
00:28:47,370 --> 00:28:52,280
um, sort of gaining access to data
primarily because of privacy issues. Yeah.

463
00:28:52,640 --> 00:28:54,070
Um, can you, like,

464
00:28:54,071 --> 00:28:58,810
you mentioned that there's like a large
database that you're probably using to

465
00:28:58,811 --> 00:28:59,710
train the algorithm.

466
00:28:59,711 --> 00:29:04,420
Can you talk maybe about like what
has been done in that end? Like how,

467
00:29:04,600 --> 00:29:08,740
what's the current status?
And I'm like, how are the,

468
00:29:09,430 --> 00:29:13,810
uh, healthcare providers
like responding to, um,

469
00:29:13,900 --> 00:29:18,900
to a need for technology companies to
have access to that data so that we can

470
00:29:19,780 --> 00:29:20,480
help them?

471
00:29:20,480 --> 00:29:24,560
Yeah. So first of all, it's, it's a
fascinating challenge. I just came, we,

472
00:29:24,561 --> 00:29:26,800
one of the, um, one of the, uh,

473
00:29:26,801 --> 00:29:29,750
organizational networks that we work
with are the Centers for disease control.

474
00:29:29,751 --> 00:29:32,780
The CDC and I just came from
a conference in Atlanta.

475
00:29:33,080 --> 00:29:36,020
The CDC is informatics
conference. And, um,

476
00:29:36,200 --> 00:29:39,930
one of the things that I learned there
was that even within the healthcare

477
00:29:39,980 --> 00:29:41,260
system,
even within the CDC,

478
00:29:41,261 --> 00:29:45,730
one organization to have significant
challenges sharing information,

479
00:29:46,030 --> 00:29:47,360
right? And it's, it's,

480
00:29:47,361 --> 00:29:52,361
it's one of the ironies of the day where
we can track almost every human on the

481
00:29:52,481 --> 00:29:56,480
planet. We know where they're going and
what they're eating and we're, you know,

482
00:29:56,500 --> 00:29:57,880
what they're doing more or less,

483
00:29:58,030 --> 00:30:02,230
but we can't keep them healthy because
the information that we get from

484
00:30:02,380 --> 00:30:05,680
healthcare providers, this
is all walked up, right?

485
00:30:06,640 --> 00:30:08,620
The way we address it just
by building our own database.

486
00:30:08,620 --> 00:30:10,630
So every time that
somebody uses our system,

487
00:30:10,870 --> 00:30:14,350
we have that information and it's de
identified and we structured our database

488
00:30:14,351 --> 00:30:17,230
in silos. And so any one of
those pieces of information,

489
00:30:17,231 --> 00:30:20,560
every one of those tables has a
different lookup function. And so you,

490
00:30:20,620 --> 00:30:24,270
you can't really get the information
about who the patient is with information

491
00:30:24,271 --> 00:30:26,890
on what the provider thinks with the
rumors about who the provider is with

492
00:30:26,891 --> 00:30:29,230
information about what the
resulting diagnosises, right.

493
00:30:29,231 --> 00:30:31,540
So you have the ability to structure it.

494
00:30:31,541 --> 00:30:36,160
So any one of those pieces
is de identified by nature.

495
00:30:36,880 --> 00:30:38,590
And what we're hoping is that,

496
00:30:38,591 --> 00:30:41,440
and I know that Google is involved in
this and a number of other organizations,

497
00:30:41,441 --> 00:30:45,100
this is what we're hoping is that these
standards will start to propagate.

498
00:30:45,310 --> 00:30:50,310
That is every piece of equipment that
is somehow digitally connected should

499
00:30:50,681 --> 00:30:55,300
enable others to learn from it and to
integrate it and to build through it

500
00:30:55,301 --> 00:30:57,640
solutions. And, and I, I've been,

501
00:30:57,790 --> 00:31:02,790
I've been very surprised for the good
and for the bad about how that works

502
00:31:04,031 --> 00:31:07,900
within different healthcare systems.
Um, so, you know, you have some of the,

503
00:31:07,901 --> 00:31:12,600
the more, uh, so we work in, we
work in countries where, you know,

504
00:31:12,601 --> 00:31:16,990
the, basically there are no land lines,
you know, everything is mobile phones and,

505
00:31:16,991 --> 00:31:20,800
and, and there are countries
like that that, um,

506
00:31:20,830 --> 00:31:23,350
that some of them are very comfortable
with the cloud and some of them,

507
00:31:23,351 --> 00:31:26,140
even though their data center
is literally, you know,

508
00:31:26,150 --> 00:31:30,190
an open shack with that that
sometimes gets rained on,

509
00:31:30,310 --> 00:31:33,710
they want things to be hosted locally.
But thanks to containerization, you,

510
00:31:33,790 --> 00:31:37,120
you can do that, right? If you
build a proper microservices
architecture, you can,

511
00:31:37,180 --> 00:31:40,090
you can make it work. Um, so I
think that we're going to get there,

512
00:31:40,300 --> 00:31:43,510
but we just need to get more people to
sign on to interoperability standards and

513
00:31:43,630 --> 00:31:47,200
we need to ensure that people recognize
that this literally has to do with

514
00:31:47,201 --> 00:31:51,040
saving lives.
And so delaying is costing lives,

515
00:31:51,980 --> 00:31:55,170
I guess as a followup
park. Um, so what, um,

516
00:31:55,340 --> 00:31:57,500
if you are collecting that information,

517
00:31:57,590 --> 00:32:01,970
there's always that fear of your data
being misused or being identified.

518
00:32:02,510 --> 00:32:06,530
So I guess even for me, if I were to go
through this, it would be like, all right,

519
00:32:06,531 --> 00:32:10,580
like how do I know that there's no one
that does a neat to see this data will

520
00:32:10,581 --> 00:32:13,820
not, will not see this
data. So on your end,

521
00:32:13,821 --> 00:32:17,030
what do you do to protect the
data that you're collecting?

522
00:32:17,170 --> 00:32:17,861
Yeah,
so first of all,

523
00:32:17,861 --> 00:32:22,861
it's what's called secondary use data
by nature because no one other than your

524
00:32:23,561 --> 00:32:27,790
provider has the information of who
you are and what the examination is.

525
00:32:28,180 --> 00:32:33,180
So we cannot be identified
by our cervix or by image,

526
00:32:34,810 --> 00:32:37,310
depends on what images of
our skin, but you know, you,

527
00:32:37,380 --> 00:32:40,040
you cannot be identified by it.
It's just not,

528
00:32:40,070 --> 00:32:43,130
there aren't public data sets available
to ensure that kind of identification of

529
00:32:43,280 --> 00:32:48,050
a person based on one mole or, or on
a cervix or an oral cavity even. Um,

530
00:32:48,051 --> 00:32:49,580
and so because of that,
you know,

531
00:32:49,581 --> 00:32:53,780
the image and the annotation
is did edified by nature.

532
00:32:54,230 --> 00:32:58,700
So there's no risk from that perspective
that a woman would be identified. Um,

533
00:32:58,730 --> 00:33:01,190
but yeah,
we need to structure correctly.

534
00:33:01,220 --> 00:33:03,500
And so when we structured our
database from the very beginning,

535
00:33:03,501 --> 00:33:06,380
we made sure that there was,
that you literally needed to,

536
00:33:06,970 --> 00:33:10,040
they had a salt and a house lookup table
between the different tables to make

537
00:33:10,041 --> 00:33:13,400
sure that in any which case you'd have
to kind of connect so many different

538
00:33:13,401 --> 00:33:16,430
pieces of data in order
to re identify someone.

539
00:33:16,730 --> 00:33:19,220
But you just don't give people the
keys so you don't make that available.

540
00:33:19,670 --> 00:33:21,730
Oh, thank you. Of course. Absolutely.

541
00:33:23,470 --> 00:33:24,303
Okay.

542
00:33:24,560 --> 00:33:29,510
Yeah. Hi, thanks for the
talk. So the question might
be out of scope of this talk,

543
00:33:29,511 --> 00:33:30,344
but it's still,

544
00:33:30,550 --> 00:33:35,550
do you know of any efforts where machine
learning is used to diagnose cancer or

545
00:33:36,231 --> 00:33:37,940
other diseases?
Um,

546
00:33:37,970 --> 00:33:42,830
based on other kinds of images like
Mri scans or CT scans? What are those?

547
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:45,300
Yeah, absolutely. Um, so
first of all there was a,

548
00:33:45,310 --> 00:33:50,310
there's now a tremendous amount of
information being made publicly available

549
00:33:50,441 --> 00:33:54,070
around the world. Thanks. The national
governments and large healthcare system.

550
00:33:54,071 --> 00:33:55,330
So I just heard that,
uh,

551
00:33:55,390 --> 00:33:58,900
the National Institutes of health just
published a huge data set of MRI based

552
00:33:58,901 --> 00:34:00,070
images.
Um,

553
00:34:00,071 --> 00:34:03,400
I know I just heard from a friend of mine
here that you can all speak with after

554
00:34:03,401 --> 00:34:05,470
that his father in law is
doing some exceptional work.

555
00:34:05,650 --> 00:34:09,760
I'm down at Hopkins and identifying cancer
in its earliest stages and colorectal

556
00:34:09,880 --> 00:34:13,240
or pancreatic, pancreatic
cancer. Um, so there, there,

557
00:34:13,241 --> 00:34:16,580
there's more and more information
becoming available, right? And,

558
00:34:16,581 --> 00:34:20,540
and that's critical. So I think that
the, the, the, the real goal has,

559
00:34:21,130 --> 00:34:24,510
and this is where I'm going to
speak for my thesis, so, so,

560
00:34:24,520 --> 00:34:28,990
so my thesis is that smart devices
are gonna make the difference.

561
00:34:29,170 --> 00:34:33,280
So data sets are great, but as
all of you were, engineer's,

562
00:34:33,310 --> 00:34:38,310
no data set is only good so far as the
source of that data is reproducible.

563
00:34:38,650 --> 00:34:42,040
So if the data set,
if you have a data set,

564
00:34:42,130 --> 00:34:46,870
but the way of collecting the data
changes than the type of analysis that you

565
00:34:46,871 --> 00:34:50,740
had, the class are you built based on the
earlier data may not be relevant for a

566
00:34:50,741 --> 00:34:54,970
future, uh, for future data. And
so one of the things that we,

567
00:34:55,240 --> 00:34:59,920
we believe as a company is that tying
the data to the device and ensuring that

568
00:34:59,921 --> 00:35:04,870
as a full solution you can control
the way you bring data and the way you

569
00:35:04,871 --> 00:35:09,000
annotate that data and the way you
analyze that data and that becomes a,

570
00:35:09,150 --> 00:35:12,840
a a virtuous cycle.
Then you can really provide Karen.

571
00:35:12,850 --> 00:35:16,420
So more and more companies are
starting to recognize that as well.

572
00:35:16,421 --> 00:35:20,540
Ge has a huge initiative around
it. I know that others also, um,

573
00:35:20,550 --> 00:35:25,550
and I think that as people start thinking
about medicine as the application of

574
00:35:26,321 --> 00:35:30,940
expertise and devices and an extension
of the ability to provide medicine,

575
00:35:30,941 --> 00:35:33,730
then we'll see more and more of that.
So there is scanned,

576
00:35:33,731 --> 00:35:37,070
I mean I think Google did
a project on the eyes.

577
00:35:37,830 --> 00:35:41,190
There is a MRI scans, CT
scans and, and others. And,

578
00:35:41,300 --> 00:35:45,480
and what I find very fascinating
is that, um, that it,

579
00:35:46,520 --> 00:35:49,380
for the past 20 years there've been
different approaches that mainly use

580
00:35:49,381 --> 00:35:50,520
computer vision.
Um,

581
00:35:50,880 --> 00:35:55,020
but really where the breakthrough is
business and applying really standard off

582
00:35:55,021 --> 00:35:58,110
the shelf models. And I'll give you an
example. That might be a little crude,

583
00:35:58,111 --> 00:36:00,390
but it's interesting because
it was just fascinating.

584
00:36:00,600 --> 00:36:05,550
So it took us a pretty long time to
develop an algorithm that can kind of

585
00:36:05,551 --> 00:36:09,030
identify the cervix. And then some
of you will know that there's a,

586
00:36:09,031 --> 00:36:13,480
there's a show on HBO show called Silicon
Valley. They, that, um, open source the,

587
00:36:13,560 --> 00:36:17,640
or at least gave a walkthrough of how
they created an algorithm for hot dog,

588
00:36:17,641 --> 00:36:22,020
not hot dog. We took that hot
dog, not hotdog instruction.

589
00:36:22,530 --> 00:36:26,400
And within three days we built
an algorithm that was cervix,

590
00:36:26,401 --> 00:36:29,100
not a cervix in three days.

591
00:36:29,640 --> 00:36:31,500
It took us like a year to do it before.

592
00:36:31,501 --> 00:36:35,490
And then with the new tools that literally
just became open, it took three days.

593
00:36:35,580 --> 00:36:36,750
And that exponential,

594
00:36:36,751 --> 00:36:41,130
I mean a lot of arrhythmic shift in terms
of speed and potential is astronaut.

595
00:36:41,131 --> 00:36:42,780
It's just, it's crazy. Right?

596
00:36:43,020 --> 00:36:45,570
And it also makes sense and this
is one of the things that you know,

597
00:36:45,690 --> 00:36:46,950
that that's why the,
you know,

598
00:36:46,951 --> 00:36:50,530
your superpowers is engineers
are so critical here because um,

599
00:36:50,780 --> 00:36:52,950
what is fascinating is that,
um,

600
00:36:53,580 --> 00:36:57,190
you have here a a moment in which,
um,

601
00:36:57,540 --> 00:37:00,690
we knew for,
for all of history,

602
00:37:00,990 --> 00:37:05,990
we knew that human beings have the
ability to perceive information and to use

603
00:37:06,541 --> 00:37:09,600
our brains in order to find patterns
in that information and then to make

604
00:37:09,601 --> 00:37:11,760
decisions, right? I mean,
that's what medicine is.

605
00:37:12,030 --> 00:37:16,050
Medicine is where you have a person
who's, you know, a magician, so to speak,

606
00:37:16,320 --> 00:37:19,320
a doctor who goes through many years
of school in order to learn all the

607
00:37:19,321 --> 00:37:20,340
different things they need to learn,

608
00:37:20,490 --> 00:37:24,840
they get to that point of care and they
make very educated guesses as to what to

609
00:37:24,841 --> 00:37:26,760
look for based on what they see.

610
00:37:26,761 --> 00:37:29,910
They referenced information that they've
learned to make certain decisions.

611
00:37:30,060 --> 00:37:33,420
And then based on the decisions they make,
the person either lives or dies. Right?

612
00:37:33,840 --> 00:37:34,320
Well,

613
00:37:34,320 --> 00:37:39,320
algorithms can see tens of thousands of
more patients than doctors ever could

614
00:37:39,600 --> 00:37:42,240
just because they can literally
reviewed tens of thousand more patients.

615
00:37:42,241 --> 00:37:47,220
So now we have the ability to actually
do what the doctor doctors have done in a

616
00:37:47,221 --> 00:37:48,960
way that we simply couldn't before.
Yeah.

617
00:37:49,930 --> 00:37:50,520
This,

618
00:37:50,520 --> 00:37:55,520
the anonymized data collected
by two mobile order duty.

619
00:37:56,830 --> 00:38:01,770
Um, um, I was able to, with our
people to a shutdown Lord our, uh,

620
00:38:01,810 --> 00:38:02,680
is our proprietary.

621
00:38:02,900 --> 00:38:05,570
So we do have a data set that we
made available through Kaggle, uh,

622
00:38:05,571 --> 00:38:08,570
in a competition that Intel
sponsored on type of cervix,

623
00:38:08,571 --> 00:38:09,830
which is critical for treatment.
Uh,

624
00:38:09,950 --> 00:38:12,500
we're going to be making more and more
data available to the research community

625
00:38:12,501 --> 00:38:14,150
and we're,
we're very excited to work with folks,

626
00:38:14,151 --> 00:38:17,230
so please feel free to contact me
at anytime and I'd be happy to,

627
00:38:17,280 --> 00:38:18,113
to share information.

628
00:38:18,920 --> 00:38:19,450
Um,

629
00:38:19,450 --> 00:38:24,450
and on a similar note to have you taught
is using this device has as a means to

630
00:38:24,521 --> 00:38:29,110
collect art to collect data on
all the other sorts of tabs.

631
00:38:29,270 --> 00:38:31,540
You use an image to the IRS.
Yes.

632
00:38:31,720 --> 00:38:36,340
So we already have the ability to do into
scopic procedure is oral. Absolutely.

633
00:38:36,370 --> 00:38:39,220
Which is critical. Absolutely
critical. Okay. Yeah. Thank you.

634
00:38:39,810 --> 00:38:40,643
Yeah.

635
00:38:40,960 --> 00:38:45,360
Hi. Hi. Um, I would just look a little
clarity on how exactly the product works.

636
00:38:45,361 --> 00:38:49,020
So I saw a photo with what looked
like an attachment sort of scope,

637
00:38:49,040 --> 00:38:50,980
sweat for Server Kush
answers specifically.

638
00:38:51,550 --> 00:38:54,880
Are you taking images
from the pap smear swab?

639
00:38:55,130 --> 00:38:55,851
No.
So I,

640
00:38:55,851 --> 00:38:58,940
I usually don't show it cause it's a
little more graphic for people who aren't

641
00:38:58,941 --> 00:38:59,420
aware.

642
00:38:59,420 --> 00:39:03,020
A woman will lie on the
table and something called
a speculum is inserted just

643
00:39:03,021 --> 00:39:07,340
like inserted today to take a pap
smear or a colposcopy. And our device,

644
00:39:07,341 --> 00:39:08,870
which is classified as a colposcope,

645
00:39:08,871 --> 00:39:11,330
which is a long range microscope
to look at the cervix,

646
00:39:11,331 --> 00:39:13,610
the vagina and the vulva
is placed at a distance.

647
00:39:13,611 --> 00:39:18,080
It never touches the patient and at a
distance it images the cervix and based on

648
00:39:18,081 --> 00:39:21,380
what it sees and what the provider sees,
they make certain decisions.

649
00:39:21,650 --> 00:39:25,100
So at this moment and what the providers
are doing is using this as a long range

650
00:39:25,101 --> 00:39:29,390
microscope to look at the
patient and based on what
they see they make decisions.

651
00:39:29,690 --> 00:39:30,710
And over time,

652
00:39:30,711 --> 00:39:33,920
as we start to provide more and more
guideline interventions and workflow

653
00:39:33,921 --> 00:39:36,560
interventions, it will also
guide them to do more and more.

654
00:39:36,890 --> 00:39:39,660
And so one of the things that
we've, the, so for example, um,

655
00:39:39,980 --> 00:39:44,540
we have a wonderful partner in the
rotary club in San Diego and they built a

656
00:39:44,541 --> 00:39:45,860
partnership between,
uh,

657
00:39:45,960 --> 00:39:49,580
the Jalala about hospital in Afghanistan
and scripts medical center in San Diego.

658
00:39:49,880 --> 00:39:52,790
And the first cervical cancer screening
program in Afghanistan was started

659
00:39:52,791 --> 00:39:56,450
because eva systems out in Afghanistan
were being used by midwives and a

660
00:39:56,451 --> 00:40:00,560
gynecologist and San Diego was watching
what they were doing and providing them

661
00:40:00,561 --> 00:40:03,560
with tips on how to actually
perform the examination.

662
00:40:04,360 --> 00:40:05,160
Thank you.

663
00:40:05,160 --> 00:40:05,993
Absolute pleasure.

664
00:40:10,120 --> 00:40:11,020
Thanks again for the talk.

665
00:40:11,110 --> 00:40:14,980
Have you found cultural barriers in terms
of using the actual device and if so,

666
00:40:14,981 --> 00:40:15,850
how do you overcome those?

667
00:40:15,851 --> 00:40:19,060
How do you do education so that the
women who are receiving care feel

668
00:40:19,061 --> 00:40:23,200
comfortable with the idea of a
more complex device being used?

669
00:40:23,320 --> 00:40:25,360
Sure. Um, so first of all, what's been,

670
00:40:25,620 --> 00:40:26,453
mm hmm.

671
00:40:27,270 --> 00:40:32,270
We've found amazing universality
and certain elements that
we had not previously

672
00:40:32,990 --> 00:40:35,340
expected. Um, so the first,

673
00:40:35,540 --> 00:40:39,980
there are cultural differences in
terms of insertion of a speculum.

674
00:40:40,130 --> 00:40:44,510
A speculum insertion is problematic in
certain places and for obvious reasons.

675
00:40:44,570 --> 00:40:48,410
Um, once you get past that hurdle,
which has nothing to do with us,

676
00:40:48,411 --> 00:40:49,730
then it's pretty straight forward.

677
00:40:49,731 --> 00:40:53,030
It's just the visualization and any place
in which a speculum is inserted there

678
00:40:53,031 --> 00:40:56,240
used to a woman visualizing them.
Um,

679
00:40:56,780 --> 00:41:00,860
what's been fascinating
actually culturally is that
what we noticed the first

680
00:41:00,861 --> 00:41:04,430
than Kenya proved to be
correct also around the world,

681
00:41:04,431 --> 00:41:09,431
which is that women loved seeing an
image of their cervix because women had

682
00:41:09,531 --> 00:41:13,220
never seen their cervix.
And remember in emerging markets,

683
00:41:13,221 --> 00:41:15,620
in rural areas and Roisin in America,

684
00:41:15,690 --> 00:41:17,150
cervical cancer is a
leading cause of death.

685
00:41:17,151 --> 00:41:20,090
So they will know a woman who
has died and cervical cancer.

686
00:41:20,150 --> 00:41:23,060
So they hear again and again that this
something they shouldn't be worried about,

687
00:41:23,061 --> 00:41:27,470
but they don't know what it is.
And so to be able to turn around and say,

688
00:41:27,500 --> 00:41:29,930
this is what I saw,
look right here,

689
00:41:30,050 --> 00:41:33,080
you have to go and get
this treated was huge.

690
00:41:33,410 --> 00:41:35,300
And as part of the interview
is one of the woman called it.

691
00:41:35,301 --> 00:41:39,380
I saw my cervical selfie right there.
They had this, this moment where it was,

692
00:41:39,381 --> 00:41:43,550
it was very empowering for her to see what
she looks like on the inside and, and,

693
00:41:43,730 --> 00:41:47,630
and in doing so reduce that, that fear
barrier. So I think that that's critical.

694
00:41:47,631 --> 00:41:51,260
I think it's critical across all of
healthcare that is, you know, in the end,

695
00:41:51,870 --> 00:41:56,360
health care has to do with the
person, the patient, right.

696
00:41:56,510 --> 00:41:59,630
So we met many times medical
device companies, um,

697
00:41:59,631 --> 00:42:01,520
think of healthcare in
a very abstract form.

698
00:42:01,521 --> 00:42:05,540
And that has to do with providers and
payers and institutions and networks.

699
00:42:05,870 --> 00:42:08,870
It has to do about that woman,
that one woman,

700
00:42:09,130 --> 00:42:12,800
and that one woman needs to own her
health because if she doesn't take care of

701
00:42:12,801 --> 00:42:16,220
herself, no matter how much the health
care system is developed and robust,

702
00:42:16,760 --> 00:42:17,593
she'll die.

703
00:42:18,140 --> 00:42:20,120
Cool. Thanks very much. Absolute pleasure.

704
00:42:21,970 --> 00:42:24,910
So we'll take one more question and then
we'll, we'll start to wrap up. Yeah.

705
00:42:26,690 --> 00:42:29,580
Um, so my question is more
on a marketing standpoint.

706
00:42:29,630 --> 00:42:33,800
So who is your target that you're going
to words and trying to sell this to?

707
00:42:34,210 --> 00:42:38,240
Like are you allowed to say how much it
costs or is that something that you're

708
00:42:38,241 --> 00:42:40,100
keeping under wraps right now?
Um,

709
00:42:40,130 --> 00:42:42,980
but just more of a marketing
where you're trying to go to,

710
00:42:42,981 --> 00:42:46,120
is it hospitals are different
organizations and stuff? Sure. That

711
00:42:46,380 --> 00:42:50,880
so mobile Ott works primarily with health
care networks and hospital networks.

712
00:42:51,090 --> 00:42:53,900
Um, although obviously the
person who uses it as a,

713
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:57,970
a nurse or a midwife or
a gynecologist there,

714
00:42:58,180 --> 00:43:00,960
procurement officer is generally
the person who purchases it. Um,

715
00:43:00,961 --> 00:43:04,890
in the United States, we sell
them for 4,000, $800 each for,

716
00:43:04,960 --> 00:43:09,660
for this generation, um, which is about
20% of the price of a traditional unit.

717
00:43:09,990 --> 00:43:13,230
And the goal is for price to
never be a barrier, right?

718
00:43:13,231 --> 00:43:17,370
We want to make sure that every provider
and every corner of America and the

719
00:43:17,371 --> 00:43:20,310
world pricing obviously is lower globally.

720
00:43:20,490 --> 00:43:24,600
We'll be able to provide the care that
they're called to provide when they

721
00:43:24,601 --> 00:43:27,840
provide it. And there was a, there
was a slide here that I wanted a,

722
00:43:27,841 --> 00:43:28,710
I'll show you in a second,

723
00:43:28,770 --> 00:43:33,530
which is important for us from a marketing
perspective. Um, the woman here, the,

724
00:43:33,531 --> 00:43:36,720
the, the icon here, that's,
that's who we call eva,

725
00:43:36,750 --> 00:43:40,830
just like the product's called Eva.
That's Eva. And Eva is who we engage with.

726
00:43:40,831 --> 00:43:44,190
Eva is the care worker or the
nurse, the midwife, the technician,

727
00:43:44,400 --> 00:43:48,240
that woman that serves Dan Knight
to serve the majority of humanity.

728
00:43:48,480 --> 00:43:51,360
And we seek to work with
her. So from a, from a,

729
00:43:51,361 --> 00:43:53,640
from a basic service perspective,

730
00:43:53,670 --> 00:43:57,900
our goal is to provide that person with
a tool she needs and we'll work with her

731
00:43:57,901 --> 00:43:58,830
healthcare system,

732
00:43:58,950 --> 00:44:02,340
with our hospital network to give her the
tools she needs to provide care to our

733
00:44:02,341 --> 00:44:03,174
patients.

734
00:44:05,180 --> 00:44:06,013
Pleasure.

735
00:44:06,450 --> 00:44:08,640
So I'll just, I'll wrap up, um, on a,

736
00:44:08,641 --> 00:44:13,310
on a very basic request from all of you.
So I'm on,

737
00:44:13,950 --> 00:44:16,860
you know, when, uh, when I was
given the opportunity to, to,

738
00:44:16,920 --> 00:44:20,190
to come here and thank you, Elana
again for making it possible. Uh,

739
00:44:20,220 --> 00:44:24,310
the thing that kept on going
through my mind was how, uh, uh,

740
00:44:24,540 --> 00:44:29,130
to use a lack of a better term,
how pregnant with potential,
um, this organization,

741
00:44:29,160 --> 00:44:34,160
Google and companies it are for impacting
the very fundamentals of healthcare

742
00:44:36,720 --> 00:44:41,640
lessons that we have learned over the
past decade and how to identify individual

743
00:44:41,641 --> 00:44:42,091
support.

744
00:44:42,091 --> 00:44:45,840
Those individuals through choices ensure
that they get to the right information

745
00:44:45,841 --> 00:44:49,470
at the right time with the right
people are lessons that are immediately

746
00:44:49,471 --> 00:44:51,960
applicable to every person on the planet.

747
00:44:52,380 --> 00:44:54,900
And Mobile Ott can only do its part in it.

748
00:44:54,930 --> 00:44:59,340
And hopefully we'll continue to
strengthen the way that providers provide

749
00:44:59,470 --> 00:45:00,303
healthcare.

750
00:45:00,840 --> 00:45:05,580
Organizations such as yours and
others in your peer group have so much

751
00:45:05,581 --> 00:45:10,170
opportunity to be able to fundamentally
affect a human condition on whether a

752
00:45:10,171 --> 00:45:13,680
person lives in other year or just not.
And so I,

753
00:45:13,740 --> 00:45:15,970
I hope that you could
use your superpowers,

754
00:45:16,140 --> 00:45:21,140
whether it be from marketing to business
to engineering to ensure that no

755
00:45:21,960 --> 00:45:24,930
person, no woman, no child, no father,

756
00:45:24,990 --> 00:45:29,460
no a man dies of an easily
preventable disease.

757
00:45:29,760 --> 00:45:32,040
Again,
thank you very much.
