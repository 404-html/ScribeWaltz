1
00:00:05,970 --> 00:00:08,560
Oh,
welcome to toxic Google today.

2
00:00:08,561 --> 00:00:13,561
It is a great privilege to be able to
introduce Dr. Joseph Ashbacher of the

3
00:00:16,120 --> 00:00:19,510
Europe European Space Agency
where he directs their
program on Earth observation.

4
00:00:19,660 --> 00:00:22,450
He's going to speak to us about
the big picture from space,

5
00:00:22,750 --> 00:00:25,180
from pixels to knowledge.
Um,

6
00:00:25,210 --> 00:00:29,710
he has led from the very
beginning starting in 1998,

7
00:00:30,010 --> 00:00:31,810
the Copernicus program,

8
00:00:32,050 --> 00:00:36,670
which is a set of multiple satellite
missions that have become the most,

9
00:00:36,730 --> 00:00:38,860
I would say, audacious, ambitious,

10
00:00:38,861 --> 00:00:43,390
comprehensive set of earth
observation missions ever created,

11
00:00:43,660 --> 00:00:46,180
going out with plan launches to 20,

12
00:00:46,181 --> 00:00:50,800
30 systematically monitoring
the entire global set of land,

13
00:00:50,801 --> 00:00:52,180
ocean and atmosphere.

14
00:00:52,390 --> 00:00:56,290
And the goal is to derive
benefit for society,

15
00:00:56,470 --> 00:01:01,020
humanitarian applications, climate
environment, crisis response. And uh,

16
00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:04,540
I hope he will speak to
us about those things. Um,

17
00:01:05,950 --> 00:01:09,630
it involves a huge amount
of data. I think, uh,

18
00:01:09,700 --> 00:01:13,180
they're coordinating delivery of
data from upwards of 30 satellites,

19
00:01:13,181 --> 00:01:17,950
delivering an excess of 10
petabytes of data each year. Um,

20
00:01:17,980 --> 00:01:22,980
we have a cooperation going on now
where that data is coming off those

21
00:01:23,381 --> 00:01:26,950
satellites and going into the Google
earth engine platform. By the way,

22
00:01:26,951 --> 00:01:28,960
I should introduce myself.
I'm Rebecca Moore.

23
00:01:29,170 --> 00:01:34,170
I lead the Google Earth Google earth
engine projects here at Google and it's

24
00:01:34,811 --> 00:01:39,760
beautiful data that they're producing.
Uh, doctor Ashbacher is Austrian.

25
00:01:40,120 --> 00:01:45,120
He has more than 35 years of professional
experience in Earth observation with a

26
00:01:45,221 --> 00:01:49,660
technical background in the natural
sciences. And really the essence of,

27
00:01:49,960 --> 00:01:54,700
of his leadership of Copernicus is to
shape a future of our planet that will

28
00:01:54,701 --> 00:01:58,510
benefit all of us. So please join
me in welcoming Dr Osh Barker.

29
00:02:05,960 --> 00:02:07,840
Okay, so good afternoon. Uh,

30
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:11,750
my name is Joseph Ashbacher and thank
you very much for the do introduce me.

31
00:02:12,200 --> 00:02:13,820
I'm from the European Space Agency.

32
00:02:13,850 --> 00:02:18,560
European Space Agency is well known all
over the world. You probably know NASA,

33
00:02:18,830 --> 00:02:23,600
but Isa is the equivalent in your hopper
dop and space agency doing a lot of

34
00:02:23,601 --> 00:02:28,220
activities in the various domains of
space. I'm very glad to be here today.

35
00:02:28,370 --> 00:02:32,930
Thank you for inviting me because I really
would like to send to you some of the

36
00:02:33,230 --> 00:02:37,430
data which we are producing and how this
data are being used for everyday life

37
00:02:37,490 --> 00:02:41,760
and how they can really help make
our planet a better place. Uh,

38
00:02:41,870 --> 00:02:46,280
let me start with one slide,
which is really showing space,

39
00:02:46,281 --> 00:02:50,570
the final frontier. All of you
know, a spaceship enterprise.

40
00:02:50,930 --> 00:02:53,960
You have all been very fanatically
watching it, including myself.

41
00:02:54,230 --> 00:02:58,970
And this is really symbolizing that we
are at the edge of what can be done and

42
00:02:58,990 --> 00:03:02,530
at the age of, of uh, what, uh,
we want to achieve as, as mankind,

43
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:06,820
but also to explore your domains not
only in outer space but also in terms of

44
00:03:06,821 --> 00:03:10,420
knowledge, in terms of technology,
which we are doing with, uh,

45
00:03:11,140 --> 00:03:12,400
as part of our daily work.

46
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:17,530
So what do you see here is
an image of our planet earth.

47
00:03:17,890 --> 00:03:22,890
They can buy Rosetta and the Rosetta
may be known to you as the satellite,

48
00:03:23,890 --> 00:03:26,360
which was flying to a faraway comment.
Our,

49
00:03:26,370 --> 00:03:29,290
which was a releasing a
sound are called filet,

50
00:03:29,530 --> 00:03:33,340
which was lending on the commit
and actually taking measurements.

51
00:03:33,341 --> 00:03:37,720
The satellite was taking measurements
around the comet and the lender of the

52
00:03:37,721 --> 00:03:42,430
comedy itself. 500 million
kilometers away from our earth.

53
00:03:42,700 --> 00:03:45,610
Uh, this, uh, satellite
was working. However,

54
00:03:45,910 --> 00:03:48,460
his image was taken much closer.
In fact,

55
00:03:48,461 --> 00:03:53,461
the satellite had to fly around the earth
to make the slingshot movements to get

56
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:55,840
throughout the space. Uh, in this case,

57
00:03:55,841 --> 00:04:00,700
a 630,000 kilometers where he
took an image or the satellite,

58
00:04:00,701 --> 00:04:05,410
took an image backup our planet earth
just to show that we are having a very

59
00:04:05,530 --> 00:04:08,800
unique vantage point on space
in order to look at our planet.

60
00:04:10,750 --> 00:04:14,380
But in the European Space Agency,
we also working on other elements,

61
00:04:14,381 --> 00:04:18,520
not only outer space and exploring new
planets, but also in different domains.

62
00:04:18,550 --> 00:04:23,140
We actually one of the few based agencies
worldwide next to NASA and the very

63
00:04:23,141 --> 00:04:26,930
few others who are covering all
the domains from orchids, uh,

64
00:04:26,980 --> 00:04:30,680
to an education systems, the
telecommunication, human space,

65
00:04:30,681 --> 00:04:32,530
flight and earth observation,

66
00:04:32,740 --> 00:04:36,910
which is the domain I'm heading
at the European Space Agency. Uh,

67
00:04:37,150 --> 00:04:37,983
what is Isa?

68
00:04:38,290 --> 00:04:43,290
Isa Is composed of 22 member states or
countries in Europe at our members and

69
00:04:44,321 --> 00:04:49,020
our funding our programs
and making decisions on how
the money's being spent, uh,

70
00:04:49,450 --> 00:04:52,510
with uh, uh, in, in
dop, nurse space agency.

71
00:04:53,020 --> 00:04:54,610
We also have cooperating states,

72
00:04:54,760 --> 00:04:59,080
last Canada who are having agreements
with us on a longterm basis in order to

73
00:04:59,081 --> 00:05:00,610
work on some of these space projects.

74
00:05:01,270 --> 00:05:06,270
And the way we usually function
or organize our funding
is that we are proposing

75
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:09,020
our member states, uh, proposal, uh,

76
00:05:09,070 --> 00:05:13,570
which may be attractive to them or not
because it is a voluntary contribution

77
00:05:13,750 --> 00:05:14,910
they give to our programs.

78
00:05:15,460 --> 00:05:19,570
It is not a subscription
by GNP or other means.

79
00:05:19,830 --> 00:05:23,620
We are making a proposal to our member
states and if they like the activity we

80
00:05:23,621 --> 00:05:27,220
are doing it put money into the pot
and they participate in the program.

81
00:05:27,490 --> 00:05:29,590
This is a very unique way
of how we're doing it.

82
00:05:29,860 --> 00:05:33,880
Meaning that we have to compete for
money, for ideas in order to really, uh,

83
00:05:34,070 --> 00:05:36,010
and our outcomes which we are doing.

84
00:05:37,630 --> 00:05:41,890
We also create inspiration for future
explorers. And this is of course, uh,

85
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:44,850
the nature of space.
It is that a,

86
00:05:44,930 --> 00:05:48,010
it really inspires you and creates a,

87
00:05:48,011 --> 00:05:51,910
your imagination and shows what
can be possible. In this case,

88
00:05:52,150 --> 00:05:57,070
we are having a regularly open days
in our facility in [inaudible],

89
00:05:57,650 --> 00:06:02,180
which is close to home. And, uh, we
inviting young kids, we show them movies.

90
00:06:02,360 --> 00:06:07,020
The astronauts are coming. And as you
see, they can get very excited in the, uh,

91
00:06:07,040 --> 00:06:08,540
seeing what, uh, what can be done

92
00:06:10,280 --> 00:06:15,280
at what I'm doing in particular in my
directorate is building satellites and

93
00:06:15,711 --> 00:06:18,410
methodologies,
how to monitor our planet.

94
00:06:18,410 --> 00:06:22,340
And there we share a great vision
together with Google earth engine,

95
00:06:22,580 --> 00:06:25,400
with also looking at the planet,
uh,

96
00:06:25,430 --> 00:06:27,770
using its capacities to computing power.

97
00:06:27,980 --> 00:06:32,720
You really make good use of information
in order to better understand how the

98
00:06:32,721 --> 00:06:35,480
planet is being or,
or what happens on the planet,

99
00:06:35,750 --> 00:06:39,350
how it can be better managed and really
derive information for decision makers,

100
00:06:39,530 --> 00:06:44,300
but for the general public to make a
awareness of what the state of our planet

101
00:06:44,301 --> 00:06:45,134
is.

102
00:06:45,260 --> 00:06:50,260
So what do you see here on this graph
is the activities of the directorate of

103
00:06:50,391 --> 00:06:52,790
Earth Observation on one child.
Uh,

104
00:06:52,791 --> 00:06:57,290
these are the lines of satellites which
we are operating and developing at the

105
00:06:57,291 --> 00:06:57,621
moment.

106
00:06:57,621 --> 00:07:02,510
We have 28 satellites that are being
under development in our order book,

107
00:07:02,570 --> 00:07:05,900
which is actually the largest
number ever, uh, which we have.

108
00:07:06,370 --> 00:07:08,750
We are operating currently 12 satellites.

109
00:07:08,780 --> 00:07:13,310
And all of these are rather substantial
satellites are where a lot of r and D is

110
00:07:13,311 --> 00:07:16,010
being invested in order to have ideas,
measurements.

111
00:07:16,430 --> 00:07:19,250
You see the three circles
here on the left hand side,

112
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:21,650
the green circle or the green orbit,

113
00:07:22,280 --> 00:07:24,530
which underlines the science missions.

114
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:28,100
So really satellites which are
addressing questions of science.

115
00:07:28,550 --> 00:07:32,210
And we are developing cutting edge
technology in order to address these

116
00:07:32,211 --> 00:07:37,211
questions of science to answer some very
important points which are being raised

117
00:07:37,731 --> 00:07:42,110
by the scientific community. Let's
take an example, a climate change.

118
00:07:42,410 --> 00:07:43,240
We are,

119
00:07:43,240 --> 00:07:48,240
scientists have asked us
to monitor closely what is
the extent of ice coverage,

120
00:07:48,620 --> 00:07:53,000
not only the extent of ice coverage, but
the volume of ice on the polar regions.

121
00:07:53,030 --> 00:07:54,470
And what is the change over time.

122
00:07:54,830 --> 00:07:57,500
And we have developed a satellite
which is doing exactly that.

123
00:07:57,710 --> 00:08:01,220
The Monitor regularly ice
coverage, uh, on a daily basis.

124
00:08:02,190 --> 00:08:05,850
So come to orbit is the compound
Nico's orbit, which is um, um,

125
00:08:06,470 --> 00:08:10,700
which are symbolizes those satellites,
which we call sentinels, uh,

126
00:08:10,710 --> 00:08:14,360
that are monitoring the planet
through the [inaudible] program.

127
00:08:15,010 --> 00:08:18,800
The [inaudible] program is a
newer program within the agency,

128
00:08:19,100 --> 00:08:21,120
but the very substantive one,
uh,

129
00:08:21,170 --> 00:08:23,840
because we are doing this
with the European Union,

130
00:08:23,870 --> 00:08:28,340
we serve who has declared formally
Kapernick who as one of the two flagship

131
00:08:28,341 --> 00:08:31,310
programs in Europe and
together European Commission,

132
00:08:31,470 --> 00:08:35,260
European Union with the European
Commission and European Space Agency.

133
00:08:35,510 --> 00:08:40,070
We are developing developing a suite
of satellites which are monitoring the

134
00:08:40,071 --> 00:08:43,700
planet from various angles with various
instruments that would explain that a

135
00:08:43,701 --> 00:08:47,660
bit more in detail in a minute.
And then the right hand side,

136
00:08:47,661 --> 00:08:52,610
we have the pathology missions where
we are building together with Eumetsat,

137
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:57,210
which is the equivalent of Noah in
hub, uh, satellites for weather,

138
00:08:57,420 --> 00:08:58,260
weather monitoring,

139
00:08:58,261 --> 00:09:03,261
but observations both in geostationary
orbit and impala orbiting Orbitz in order

140
00:09:03,691 --> 00:09:05,910
to really see the various
aspects of climate,

141
00:09:05,911 --> 00:09:07,920
part of weather and climate parameters

142
00:09:10,390 --> 00:09:13,880
knocking off a space and observation,
observing the earth.

143
00:09:14,430 --> 00:09:18,950
This is a very good example of the very
first image. It's a typo satellite,

144
00:09:18,951 --> 00:09:20,110
which is a US satellite,

145
00:09:20,690 --> 00:09:25,690
which did Monte told the earth
in 1960 on the 1st of April.

146
00:09:26,150 --> 00:09:30,140
Uh, the satellite was
taking this first elevation,

147
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:33,980
a picture from space.
You see the New York Times article,

148
00:09:33,981 --> 00:09:38,060
which is referring to it as
really a new era in mythology,

149
00:09:38,210 --> 00:09:40,700
which has started with this
launch of the satellite

150
00:09:42,350 --> 00:09:43,310
a few years later.

151
00:09:43,610 --> 00:09:48,610
Now we also having a satellites
observing earth for climate and weather

152
00:09:50,150 --> 00:09:51,540
purposes.
Uh,

153
00:09:51,560 --> 00:09:56,560
here are some examples that are
measuring and observing constantly,

154
00:09:57,130 --> 00:09:59,510
uh, the state of, of cloud coverage.

155
00:09:59,511 --> 00:10:04,160
But those other by the parameters to both
[inaudible] which is the geostationary

156
00:10:04,161 --> 00:10:06,410
satellite and, uh, met doc,

157
00:10:06,440 --> 00:10:11,440
which are the polar orbiting satellites
which are going on updating the wider

158
00:10:11,840 --> 00:10:13,580
services with this type of information.

159
00:10:15,830 --> 00:10:20,830
What do you see here is a
very good example of how
set the lights work in daily

160
00:10:21,081 --> 00:10:25,080
life. In this case, you
see a superstorm Sandy, uh,

161
00:10:25,190 --> 00:10:27,110
well known in the United States.

162
00:10:27,530 --> 00:10:31,790
I was actually a storm that
costs quite a few tents off. Uh,

163
00:10:32,030 --> 00:10:36,140
I showed this a first in the
Caribbean that you see at the bottom,

164
00:10:36,141 --> 00:10:39,260
the start of a superstorm Sandy,
the storm.

165
00:10:39,261 --> 00:10:42,560
Then when those votes and
at some point of time,

166
00:10:42,850 --> 00:10:47,600
a mythological service is expected
that the strobe would, um, uh, towards,

167
00:10:48,270 --> 00:10:48,560
uh,

168
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:53,560
to the east and therefore not cause a
danger for the Washington New York area.

169
00:10:55,760 --> 00:11:00,080
Uh, however, as you see the
actual costs of the store,

170
00:11:00,081 --> 00:11:01,340
which is on the right hand side,

171
00:11:01,630 --> 00:11:06,630
showed that the superstorm sandy went
into the north eastern part of the

172
00:11:07,221 --> 00:11:10,820
American continent and
Willie cost again damage.

173
00:11:11,100 --> 00:11:16,040
I'd also Keisha this at this point of
time of interest is the image in the

174
00:11:16,041 --> 00:11:19,790
middle which shows these values
are lines and different colors,

175
00:11:20,180 --> 00:11:23,390
which are your forecasts off the,
uh,

176
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:28,010
off the path of the storm a few
days in advance. So in this case,

177
00:11:28,011 --> 00:11:31,070
a 9.5 days in advance and you see that,
uh,

178
00:11:31,130 --> 00:11:33,800
that was a wide variety of
where the story will end up.

179
00:11:34,080 --> 00:11:38,600
A Benny few actually indicated that
he turns her again towards the West,

180
00:11:38,900 --> 00:11:42,140
towards the continent and therefore
would cause with cause some damage.

181
00:11:42,850 --> 00:11:47,670
And this of course was that
predicted, uh, quite well. Um, in,

182
00:11:47,900 --> 00:11:49,220
uh,
uh,

183
00:11:49,400 --> 00:11:54,400
addiction occula see satellites were
used and could 6.5 days in advance at the

184
00:11:55,541 --> 00:12:00,340
storm actually would turn left and
right and therefore some measures,

185
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:02,470
but they can in order to improve that.

186
00:12:03,370 --> 00:12:07,600
I should probably also say that in global
by the forecast or if you look outside

187
00:12:07,990 --> 00:12:12,610
and you hear that the weather tomorrow
is Sunday or stormy satellites today are

188
00:12:12,611 --> 00:12:15,760
the major data source
or forecast accuracy.

189
00:12:16,300 --> 00:12:19,760
If you take all the measurements,
put together what we call in situ,

190
00:12:19,770 --> 00:12:23,800
which is measurements on the ground in
the atmosphere with radio songs, uh,

191
00:12:23,830 --> 00:12:26,140
by boats, by airplanes, uh,

192
00:12:26,200 --> 00:12:28,870
those measurements which we
call in situ measurements.

193
00:12:28,871 --> 00:12:31,390
I bought one third of
the forecast accuracy,

194
00:12:31,810 --> 00:12:34,860
added two thirds come from
satellites of various nature.

195
00:12:34,960 --> 00:12:38,710
I think this is a underlining and
highlighting how important Saturday have

196
00:12:38,711 --> 00:12:40,600
become power daily life.

197
00:12:41,730 --> 00:12:42,390
Yeah.

198
00:12:42,390 --> 00:12:47,120
Another example of where satellites are
really useful is climate monitoring and

199
00:12:47,121 --> 00:12:48,740
monitoring the state of our environment.

200
00:12:48,860 --> 00:12:52,400
What you see here is the Paris conference,

201
00:12:52,430 --> 00:12:54,710
which was adopting the Paris agreement,
uh,

202
00:12:55,100 --> 00:12:58,940
which was a milestone in a
climate monitoring but, uh,

203
00:12:59,240 --> 00:13:03,590
expressed by the political community
who have been committing to preserve the

204
00:13:03,591 --> 00:13:05,050
planet.
And a,

205
00:13:05,060 --> 00:13:09,230
this was a very important moment and
we have committed ourselves as European

206
00:13:09,231 --> 00:13:13,100
space agency to use our satellites
in support of climate monitoring.

207
00:13:14,610 --> 00:13:18,600
Some of these satellites are shown here.
The sentinel satellites,

208
00:13:19,080 --> 00:13:23,550
the cofounder Cosentino satellites
are grouped in five or six different

209
00:13:23,551 --> 00:13:25,800
families. Uh, they are, uh,

210
00:13:26,430 --> 00:13:28,860
using different instruments on board,

211
00:13:29,160 --> 00:13:34,030
on the radar to optical imagery,
the larger scale, a wider, uh,

212
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:35,370
scale,
uh,

213
00:13:35,370 --> 00:13:39,840
measurements of oceans on the land
surface is a to atmospheric Trey's house

214
00:13:39,940 --> 00:13:43,720
gases. So you see here on the
left hand side, a sentinel one a,

215
00:13:43,770 --> 00:13:48,740
which is a center that provides and meter
resolution in the radar domain central

216
00:13:48,750 --> 00:13:53,100
to have very uh,
much used because it has a,

217
00:13:53,101 --> 00:13:56,460
an instrument on board
with 13 or channels,

218
00:13:56,570 --> 00:14:01,350
a spectral channels that can measure
the earth state on a regular basis,

219
00:14:01,780 --> 00:14:06,150
like a camera in the visible,
a domain of the electromagnetic spectrum,

220
00:14:06,390 --> 00:14:08,700
but also in the name of it
and short wave infrared,

221
00:14:08,910 --> 00:14:12,030
which gives information on the
state of agitation for example,

222
00:14:12,180 --> 00:14:16,740
but also many other parameters sent in
a three s three installments and bought

223
00:14:17,070 --> 00:14:21,940
again for large scale monitoring
of oceans and uh, and uh,

224
00:14:22,020 --> 00:14:24,150
landmasses a betters parameters.

225
00:14:24,151 --> 00:14:28,710
I will show a few examples in a minute
and sending a spawned five atmospheric

226
00:14:28,980 --> 00:14:33,930
gases that are of course at the source
of global bombing and define the changing

227
00:14:34,170 --> 00:14:35,003
climate.

228
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:36,270
Yeah.

229
00:14:36,270 --> 00:14:40,110
So what we do with the satellites is
really measuring the earth's system,

230
00:14:40,680 --> 00:14:43,540
different parameters that
are all interconnected, uh,

231
00:14:43,590 --> 00:14:47,040
measure various elements of our,
of our planet.

232
00:14:47,700 --> 00:14:52,310
Here we see the example of chlorophyll,
sea level height, sea surface temperature.

233
00:14:52,670 --> 00:14:56,300
Knight was oxide, oxide,
carbon dioxide. So moisture,

234
00:14:56,301 --> 00:14:59,300
but there are also many other parameters
which we are measuring on a regular

235
00:14:59,301 --> 00:15:01,070
basis with uh,
with the satellites.

236
00:15:02,390 --> 00:15:06,710
What I'm showing here is actually a
complicated graph and I'm not going to

237
00:15:06,711 --> 00:15:08,240
explain all these lines,

238
00:15:08,420 --> 00:15:12,830
but there are two messages I would like
you to take with you on looking at this.

239
00:15:12,831 --> 00:15:16,360
Uh, at this graph here. The
first message is that, uh,

240
00:15:16,490 --> 00:15:20,960
the different colors are showing
different families of sentinels,

241
00:15:20,990 --> 00:15:23,120
meaning different
observation technologies,

242
00:15:23,660 --> 00:15:27,140
which are really providing measurements
of all the parameters of the,

243
00:15:27,170 --> 00:15:30,950
of the globe, uh, which are
the atmosphere, the oceans,

244
00:15:31,140 --> 00:15:35,150
a polar regions, uh, uh,
which are uh, a system,

245
00:15:35,180 --> 00:15:36,320
a system together.

246
00:15:36,470 --> 00:15:40,250
And the various sensors which we have
put on the set on the sentinels are

247
00:15:40,310 --> 00:15:42,350
observing that is out of the services.

248
00:15:43,340 --> 00:15:48,340
The second message is it long continuous
lines in this case up to 2027,

249
00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:53,210
but I could have this graph showing up
to 2040 and he would still see that these

250
00:15:53,211 --> 00:15:56,240
measurements are taking place
over long periods of time.

251
00:15:56,370 --> 00:16:00,080
And this is one of the most important
features of the compound Nicos Program

252
00:16:00,290 --> 00:16:02,060
that we are committing ourselves.

253
00:16:02,350 --> 00:16:05,540
We have satellites that provide
these measurements basically forever.

254
00:16:05,780 --> 00:16:10,610
Meaning that after one generation is
coming to the end of its life and next

255
00:16:10,611 --> 00:16:14,660
generation will be flown in space of
course with improved the sensors and

256
00:16:14,661 --> 00:16:18,080
instruments and this will be followed
by another generation to really a

257
00:16:18,081 --> 00:16:20,750
continuous measurement,
serious of observations,

258
00:16:20,780 --> 00:16:24,260
which of course is crucial for
anyone to really passed in this data.

259
00:16:24,350 --> 00:16:26,780
Take them up and use
them in the long term.

260
00:16:28,580 --> 00:16:29,840
Sentinel one,
uh,

261
00:16:29,841 --> 00:16:34,550
one of the sentinels which is measuring
various parameters shown here in an

262
00:16:34,551 --> 00:16:37,350
artistic impression or it has a uh,

263
00:16:37,580 --> 00:16:41,390
a way that instrument as the maintenance
torment or you see her also do solar

264
00:16:41,391 --> 00:16:41,811
panels.

265
00:16:41,811 --> 00:16:45,770
But the way that installment is working
in [inaudible] and taking images of the

266
00:16:45,771 --> 00:16:50,210
earth day and night independent of weather
conditions because radar goes through

267
00:16:50,211 --> 00:16:52,100
the atmosphere,
even if it's clouded,

268
00:16:52,101 --> 00:16:55,940
even if it is a rainy even at night
and you can get data of this area.

269
00:16:56,840 --> 00:16:59,950
I'm showing now a few examples of what
can be measured with these way down

270
00:16:59,960 --> 00:17:00,381
images,

271
00:17:00,381 --> 00:17:04,370
which are a bit unusual compared to
optical images of which you are probably

272
00:17:04,371 --> 00:17:05,204
more used to.

273
00:17:05,780 --> 00:17:10,120
This is a a way dot image showing or
different radar images showing. Uh,

274
00:17:10,320 --> 00:17:15,310
the changes of our co-op's are of lights.
Cops are in,

275
00:17:15,311 --> 00:17:18,360
uh, uh, the Vietnam area.
Uh, and what you see here,

276
00:17:18,390 --> 00:17:20,930
the different colors is
different states of uh,

277
00:17:21,020 --> 00:17:26,020
of the planting cycle which allow you to
read three for yield of including also

278
00:17:27,741 --> 00:17:28,071
some,

279
00:17:28,071 --> 00:17:33,071
some other information or you see here
are written on the slide that this was a,

280
00:17:33,201 --> 00:17:37,160
um, a case where we had an El
Nino effect. That means some, uh,

281
00:17:37,280 --> 00:17:39,890
changes in our global a global system.

282
00:17:40,430 --> 00:17:45,430
And we got a loss of the rice yield
of about 16% between two years,

283
00:17:46,490 --> 00:17:50,970
2015, 2016 based, uh, due
to the effects of El Nino,

284
00:17:51,750 --> 00:17:53,460
which costs financial damage,

285
00:17:53,700 --> 00:17:58,140
but also people who have been
suffering from this El Nino effect.

286
00:17:58,440 --> 00:18:01,110
I or not having the food
security are required,

287
00:18:02,780 --> 00:18:05,370
not the example of what
is radar data can do.

288
00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:10,440
And this is quite unique is measuring
deformations of the surface itself.

289
00:18:12,120 --> 00:18:17,000
You see here an image of Mexico City,
you see the red areas,

290
00:18:17,010 --> 00:18:22,010
which are areas that have actually sank
in that have been reduced in terms of

291
00:18:22,201 --> 00:18:25,410
surface height, uh, to, to uh, water, uh,

292
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:30,240
which was expected from
underground drinking water,
uh, water for other purposes.

293
00:18:30,540 --> 00:18:35,100
And do you see here that uh,
in one month up to 2.5 centimeters,

294
00:18:35,101 --> 00:18:39,810
one inch, uh, was actually the change of
height. This was done over three months.

295
00:18:40,020 --> 00:18:40,230
Uh,

296
00:18:40,230 --> 00:18:45,230
so in three months you had three inches
of a change or 7.5 centimeters of change

297
00:18:45,570 --> 00:18:49,380
in the surface level, uh, in the city
of Mexico, almost not believable.

298
00:18:49,680 --> 00:18:53,430
I didn't really happen that buildings
and all the structure above was thinking

299
00:18:53,431 --> 00:18:56,560
in quite significantly
as an effect of this. I,

300
00:18:56,610 --> 00:18:59,760
it's also just a pacing and you
can make sure this, I'm space,

301
00:19:00,180 --> 00:19:05,180
our satellites fly in 800 kilometers
altitude and you can measure accuracies of

302
00:19:06,541 --> 00:19:09,600
changes in the fractures in
the order of millimeters,

303
00:19:09,630 --> 00:19:13,650
which is quite astonishing using a
technology called interferometry.

304
00:19:15,390 --> 00:19:18,570
And the same technology has
been, uh, used recently.

305
00:19:18,600 --> 00:19:23,600
You see here an example of a California
highway number one hour before and after

306
00:19:25,920 --> 00:19:29,610
on the left side, before under the
right send after the landslide,

307
00:19:29,611 --> 00:19:32,850
which was destroying the highway,
but also the sounding area.

308
00:19:33,180 --> 00:19:35,970
It's happened on May 24th,

309
00:19:35,970 --> 00:19:40,830
2017 and the analyses of the satellite
image shows in the right areas that this

310
00:19:40,831 --> 00:19:42,750
is the area which was
actually thinking in.

311
00:19:42,900 --> 00:19:45,030
And you can measure how
many centimeters are,

312
00:19:45,031 --> 00:19:49,470
how many inches are these changes have
been made or you see here very clearly

313
00:19:49,471 --> 00:19:54,020
that I, the extreme cases to have
been two meters, uh, off, uh,

314
00:19:54,030 --> 00:19:56,290
changes in height.
You do this a landslide.

315
00:19:57,920 --> 00:19:58,753
Okay.

316
00:19:58,790 --> 00:20:03,740
But Isa is not only would using sentinel
satellites but also other satellites

317
00:20:03,741 --> 00:20:08,741
which are walk yet for scientific use
and which are addressing some very key

318
00:20:09,530 --> 00:20:10,640
questions of science.

319
00:20:11,210 --> 00:20:15,560
What do you see here are those are what
we call earth explorers that have been

320
00:20:15,561 --> 00:20:20,060
launched so far. You'll see ya. Gotcha.
Uh, which is on the left hand side,

321
00:20:20,470 --> 00:20:22,970
s Moss,
a Kiowa south and small.

322
00:20:22,971 --> 00:20:27,530
But that would show some of the examples
of this, of the use of this data.

323
00:20:28,040 --> 00:20:30,100
Right now, coach here, uh,

324
00:20:30,180 --> 00:20:35,180
which is so measuring did you eat of
the earth is actually having on board a

325
00:20:36,141 --> 00:20:39,440
very highly high position radiometer,

326
00:20:39,830 --> 00:20:43,160
which he is so emotionally engaged with
the changes or the cabinetry field of

327
00:20:43,161 --> 00:20:47,120
the earth.
You see here the earth rotating,

328
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:51,990
you might assume earthy,
sir around a ball, uh,

329
00:20:52,120 --> 00:20:55,510
is as a round shape. It does not.
It actually looks like a potato.

330
00:20:55,780 --> 00:21:00,530
If you consider the uh, the
gravitational, uh, field of,

331
00:21:00,550 --> 00:21:01,320
uh, of, of,

332
00:21:01,320 --> 00:21:06,320
of the planet and the satellite has
actually provided the most accurate a guy

333
00:21:06,631 --> 00:21:10,990
with the measurements or ever flown in
space. It has the ob did in the meanwhile,

334
00:21:11,350 --> 00:21:15,050
I it was launched in 2009 and
it had a control to, again,

335
00:21:15,910 --> 00:21:20,020
I'm the stop, uh, 2013, uh, which, uh, um,

336
00:21:20,170 --> 00:21:22,950
by it measured actually
while it was descending a,

337
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:25,480
again with high accuracy
of these parameters.

338
00:21:26,140 --> 00:21:30,340
You also see that the satellite is quite
unusual compared to others who may have

339
00:21:30,341 --> 00:21:32,530
seen it looks almost like an airplane.

340
00:21:32,531 --> 00:21:36,940
It has wings because it was flying at a
much lower altitude compared to others,

341
00:21:37,060 --> 00:21:38,980
which was required to
make these measurements.

342
00:21:40,360 --> 00:21:40,880
Yeah.

343
00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:45,880
Now the example is a s a s mos stands
for soil moisture and ocean salinity,

344
00:21:46,450 --> 00:21:50,870
uh, which is a satellite that is
measuring these two parameters.

345
00:21:51,140 --> 00:21:56,140
So moisture over the land surfaces
and ocean salinity of ocean surfaces.

346
00:21:56,700 --> 00:21:58,300
What'd you see here?
The uh,

347
00:21:58,780 --> 00:22:02,930
you see software salinity
values over a period of time.

348
00:22:02,990 --> 00:22:07,990
You see the months are on the right hand
bottom of animation and you see very

349
00:22:08,631 --> 00:22:13,040
clearly there are some areas where
which are more salty and others are less

350
00:22:13,041 --> 00:22:15,700
salty. The blue means a,
it is more freshwater,

351
00:22:15,760 --> 00:22:20,760
so less lower salinity and the means
higher salinity areas which have a very

352
00:22:21,561 --> 00:22:25,180
high rainfall for example in
the topic, uh, everywhere. Uh,

353
00:22:26,210 --> 00:22:31,190
the water from the clouds are less halted
as compared to other areas which are,

354
00:22:31,670 --> 00:22:32,870
for example,
further up north.

355
00:22:34,590 --> 00:22:35,040
Yeah.

356
00:22:35,040 --> 00:22:36,590
Another example of these measurements,

357
00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:40,250
our measurements by our ice satellite,

358
00:22:40,280 --> 00:22:45,110
which is measuring extent but also
volume of the ice coverage. Uh,

359
00:22:45,160 --> 00:22:48,080
you see here the ice
volume and mass balance.

360
00:22:48,081 --> 00:22:52,040
Our measurements as they are
taken by io site satellite. Yeah.

361
00:22:52,130 --> 00:22:56,840
In the case of Greenland. And you'll see
the capability for loss of volume, uh,

362
00:22:56,850 --> 00:22:59,960
off, uh, Greenland over a couple of years,

363
00:23:00,170 --> 00:23:04,650
which are regularly updated with the
satellite. And I should also say that, uh,

364
00:23:05,090 --> 00:23:09,260
for many years scientists have
actually been arguing if not fighting,

365
00:23:09,770 --> 00:23:14,450
whether there's an increase or decrease
of the mass balance of ice in Greenland.

366
00:23:14,590 --> 00:23:19,360
And this was a question which for extra
d quite a few years or I was disputed a

367
00:23:19,390 --> 00:23:22,800
until NASA and esa half put together yes.

368
00:23:22,820 --> 00:23:26,860
Science teams and all the satellite
observations which they have with that set

369
00:23:26,861 --> 00:23:31,530
the lights but also other means on ground
and otherwise and have come, uh, hyper.

370
00:23:31,640 --> 00:23:32,990
I've compared, uh, uh,

371
00:23:33,070 --> 00:23:38,070
data sets and have clearly found out
that there is a net mass balance loss,

372
00:23:38,810 --> 00:23:41,960
meaning there's a melting
which takes place. However,

373
00:23:42,290 --> 00:23:46,320
in some of the areas there
is actually also an of mass,

374
00:23:46,321 --> 00:23:49,220
especially in the central parts
of Queensland. For example,

375
00:23:49,520 --> 00:23:53,150
in here in this, uh, diagram,

376
00:23:53,151 --> 00:23:55,290
which is on a different, uh, uh,

377
00:23:55,340 --> 00:23:58,790
satellite measurements
serious from central one.

378
00:23:59,180 --> 00:24:03,530
I did also show us very clearly by
different measurements taken over time,

379
00:24:03,730 --> 00:24:07,160
our way or the mass flows.
The ice flows actually take place.

380
00:24:07,270 --> 00:24:08,450
You've seen in the middle,
uh,

381
00:24:08,540 --> 00:24:12,540
the bluish areas which are indicating
that there's a slight increase of Moscow

382
00:24:12,770 --> 00:24:14,700
of course towards the edges.
Uh,

383
00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:18,700
the snow and the ice are melting and
the flowing towards the coastline.

384
00:24:21,150 --> 00:24:25,270
Another mission which is actually
quite a challenge for us is um,

385
00:24:25,760 --> 00:24:29,640
the uh, uh, a lidar, a
mission or called [inaudible],

386
00:24:29,960 --> 00:24:33,890
which is using a huge,
a lighter instrument on board.

387
00:24:33,891 --> 00:24:37,820
You see it in this big home or
the satellite of a laser or light.

388
00:24:37,821 --> 00:24:42,821
A beam comes out in the ultraviolet and
we'll measure when it is launched in

389
00:24:43,870 --> 00:24:47,360
about a half a year's time,
we'll measure wind speed,

390
00:24:47,510 --> 00:24:50,900
wind direction in a three dimensional
field in cloud for the atmosphere.

391
00:24:51,410 --> 00:24:55,910
Because the Lidar, the laser beam is
actually reflected on the molecules,

392
00:24:56,340 --> 00:24:59,840
the particulates in the atmosphere
and the element is coming back to the

393
00:24:59,841 --> 00:25:00,674
satellite.

394
00:25:00,680 --> 00:25:04,250
And those elements coming back through
the velocity of the satellite allows you

395
00:25:04,251 --> 00:25:08,360
to replete in three dimensions.
Actually,

396
00:25:08,361 --> 00:25:12,530
this is a technology which
is not existing at all today.

397
00:25:12,920 --> 00:25:14,570
Um, we had, uh,

398
00:25:14,690 --> 00:25:19,340
some technical hurdles to overcome
because it is a completely new,

399
00:25:19,400 --> 00:25:23,690
unique technology which we are
developing here as part of our R and d

400
00:25:23,691 --> 00:25:24,524
activities.

401
00:25:24,890 --> 00:25:29,890
At some point in time our engineers got
stuck and couldn't figure out some of

402
00:25:30,501 --> 00:25:35,300
the issues that were, uh, stopping
some of the work we did called NASA,

403
00:25:35,360 --> 00:25:39,200
uh, for help. Uh, NASA said, no,
no, we are not working on this.

404
00:25:39,201 --> 00:25:41,930
This is too challenging,
but you figure it out.

405
00:25:41,931 --> 00:25:45,440
Please tell us how we used
to have department because
it is something we would

406
00:25:45,441 --> 00:25:49,520
like to do as well. So we
are, I'm knocking on wood,

407
00:25:49,550 --> 00:25:52,400
we are looking forward to this
measurements. They will be really unique.

408
00:25:52,401 --> 00:25:55,640
And I think something that our
user community, in this case,

409
00:25:55,641 --> 00:25:59,480
meteorologists or the forecasting
services really need to have.

410
00:26:01,550 --> 00:26:03,530
So global challenges on a changing planet.

411
00:26:03,590 --> 00:26:05,690
Is this really something
that concerns have we won?

412
00:26:05,870 --> 00:26:07,670
I'm not the only other space agencies,

413
00:26:07,671 --> 00:26:10,310
but really every single
citizen on this globe.

414
00:26:10,920 --> 00:26:15,140
We are working a lot in this domain.
Are you see here the Sdgs,

415
00:26:15,170 --> 00:26:19,130
the sustainable development goals as
they have been approved by the UN system,

416
00:26:19,460 --> 00:26:22,730
uh,
which I indicating a number of goals,

417
00:26:23,390 --> 00:26:28,370
targets and indicators which are
important in order to preserve our planet.

418
00:26:28,890 --> 00:26:31,550
Uh,
you see some blue ticks on the boxes.

419
00:26:31,850 --> 00:26:35,870
These are the ones where space can
help providing critical measurements.

420
00:26:36,280 --> 00:26:37,160
And we are doing this,

421
00:26:37,161 --> 00:26:41,570
we're setting up a program that will
address many of these indicators, uh,

422
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:45,690
with the means of satellites
in order to, uh, really, uh,

423
00:26:45,960 --> 00:26:49,260
understand the state of the planet
but also help improving its state.

424
00:26:51,220 --> 00:26:55,330
One example is her urbanization.
Uh, you see here a Shanghai,

425
00:26:55,900 --> 00:27:00,900
an image taken in 1975 in 1990 in 2000.

426
00:27:02,200 --> 00:27:05,740
I need 2010. And you see how
happy lady city was evolving.

427
00:27:05,830 --> 00:27:09,760
What do you see in red color? Here
is the hilltop area. So basically,

428
00:27:09,761 --> 00:27:13,660
really the area which was a changing
over the last few days very rapidly.

429
00:27:13,661 --> 00:27:17,950
And this is typically one
of the parameters that can
be measured from space.

430
00:27:19,060 --> 00:27:19,540
Okay.

431
00:27:19,540 --> 00:27:23,320
Another measurement we are taking
very important, very critical,

432
00:27:23,710 --> 00:27:26,880
is a c level of ice. We all know, um,

433
00:27:26,980 --> 00:27:31,980
newspapers on TV at the urban change is
costing among other things an increase

434
00:27:32,531 --> 00:27:36,840
in temperature but also an increased.
So Sea level, sea level height, uh,

435
00:27:36,940 --> 00:27:41,260
which has been recorded
here. Uh, Tim's a thousand,

436
00:27:41,710 --> 00:27:46,360
since 1700, uh, over several hundred
years already based on measurements.

437
00:27:46,361 --> 00:27:50,320
And uh, they called on the surface
and you'll see this window here,

438
00:27:50,440 --> 00:27:54,820
which is the window when satellite started
taking very precise measurements of

439
00:27:54,821 --> 00:27:56,440
sea level changes.

440
00:27:56,710 --> 00:27:59,410
And then on the right hand side
you see the future projections,

441
00:27:59,680 --> 00:28:03,760
future projections, meaning depending
on how much your global change,

442
00:28:03,761 --> 00:28:07,410
we accept how much temperature increases
we have in which direction this curve

443
00:28:07,440 --> 00:28:11,260
we go. And uh, you see, first of
all, the curves all point upwards,

444
00:28:11,590 --> 00:28:15,670
which is scary. Uh, but also
the variation is quite high,

445
00:28:15,880 --> 00:28:19,540
meaning that it depends a
lot on how mankind in total,

446
00:28:19,570 --> 00:28:22,050
we'll behave over the next years.
Uh,

447
00:28:22,330 --> 00:28:25,420
in order to decide what did we on
the upper curve, in the middle curve,

448
00:28:25,450 --> 00:28:26,290
on the lower curve.

449
00:28:26,320 --> 00:28:29,200
And of course we hope we are on the
lower curve because that would be the low

450
00:28:29,201 --> 00:28:33,050
impact. But what you also see on
the right hand side is that, uh,

451
00:28:33,070 --> 00:28:34,890
this is a curve of sea level rise,

452
00:28:34,920 --> 00:28:38,940
which is going up very clearly measured
from space in this case with very

453
00:28:38,941 --> 00:28:39,880
independent means.

454
00:28:40,270 --> 00:28:44,860
We see here over the last 20 years
that the sea level on average,

455
00:28:45,130 --> 00:28:47,380
most of icing about three
millimeters per year,

456
00:28:48,700 --> 00:28:53,410
three millimeters may not sound a lot,
but if it's 10 years, 20 years, 100 years,

457
00:28:53,680 --> 00:28:58,300
it is a very, uh, important amount
of sea level of eyes, of course,

458
00:28:58,330 --> 00:29:03,220
leading to some areas that will be
flooded, small islands in the Pacific,

459
00:29:03,221 --> 00:29:06,700
a disappearing some
cities on the coastline.

460
00:29:06,701 --> 00:29:09,610
So being on the water
and not any believable.

461
00:29:09,670 --> 00:29:14,050
And I described a difficult imagine
that this will actually happen,

462
00:29:14,051 --> 00:29:18,070
but it is measured and it will
be happening. Uh, no doubt.

463
00:29:20,630 --> 00:29:24,580
Same. Oh shown here against sea
level rise on the left hand side, uh,

464
00:29:24,630 --> 00:29:28,670
sea surface temperature on the item side.
Uh, these are measurements which her,

465
00:29:28,680 --> 00:29:31,740
which have been taken by satellites.
First of all,

466
00:29:31,741 --> 00:29:36,741
do you see that the sea level is not only
changing on average across the globe,

467
00:29:37,390 --> 00:29:42,130
but has a very strong local variations?
A does of course depend the weather.

468
00:29:42,380 --> 00:29:46,780
Uh, on barriers, a ocean circulation
element are you see, for example,

469
00:29:46,781 --> 00:29:50,800
very clearly the Gulf stream off
of I'm Florida water, your hub,

470
00:29:50,801 --> 00:29:53,650
which has this red blue carbons,

471
00:29:54,040 --> 00:29:58,480
which is having a very large
change of sea level, uh,

472
00:29:58,530 --> 00:30:03,130
of sea level, uh, along along its
way. Awesome. A surface temperature,

473
00:30:03,190 --> 00:30:04,990
sea surface temperature
on the right hand side.

474
00:30:05,260 --> 00:30:09,140
Also changing accordingly depending
on weather, depending on atmosphere,

475
00:30:09,920 --> 00:30:12,580
ocean circulation and
a number of parameters.

476
00:30:14,380 --> 00:30:19,330
Other parameters we are measuring or
regularly with our satellites are the

477
00:30:19,331 --> 00:30:22,090
extent of ice coverage.
In this case, the Arctic.

478
00:30:22,760 --> 00:30:27,160
I this actually very interesting to see
how over the years and you see the scale

479
00:30:27,161 --> 00:30:32,110
at the bottom, the extent,
the maximum extent of ice
cover, uh, is really changing.

480
00:30:32,230 --> 00:30:37,230
It is known on this is not surprising
that different windows or different years,

481
00:30:37,361 --> 00:30:41,740
hefty, different extents are some, a
book holds about Lesser Colton, uh,

482
00:30:41,900 --> 00:30:42,733
the previous one.

483
00:30:43,120 --> 00:30:47,170
But there's one clear trend and you see
it here that the further you go, uh,

484
00:30:47,350 --> 00:30:50,230
forward in the scale,
the world's 2000, 2010,

485
00:30:50,530 --> 00:30:54,360
the less ice coverage you have
in the polar regions. And, uh,

486
00:30:54,490 --> 00:30:59,490
this leads already and even boy and
a future to some areas being icefree,

487
00:31:00,100 --> 00:31:04,390
which used to be covered by ice, uh,
which has of course, huge impact for many,

488
00:31:04,391 --> 00:31:08,830
many elements for climate parameters,
but also ship voting.

489
00:31:08,831 --> 00:31:12,850
For example. Uh, you can for
example, here go from Europe,

490
00:31:13,720 --> 00:31:18,160
Japan, you were saying the north
eastern acid, uh, meaning, uh, going,

491
00:31:18,640 --> 00:31:19,530
uh,
north,

492
00:31:19,830 --> 00:31:24,820
the Arctic area instead of all the way
around in Africa and all the way to Japan,

493
00:31:24,821 --> 00:31:28,590
which of course is much longer
and therefore has a much
more expensive, I do dot.

494
00:31:28,630 --> 00:31:33,180
That's also threatening environment in
the ecosystem in this areas because ships

495
00:31:33,190 --> 00:31:37,390
are suddenly costing this area,
which did not cause the area before.

496
00:31:39,780 --> 00:31:43,720
So all this is really showing how
sad, what satellites can measure, uh,

497
00:31:43,721 --> 00:31:47,790
and how they can be used.
So what do we do in European Space Agency?

498
00:31:47,791 --> 00:31:52,600
But this is happening everywhere.
Especially also he'd Google, uh, that, uh,

499
00:31:52,670 --> 00:31:56,450
the space data are being
combined with all other assets.

500
00:31:56,451 --> 00:31:58,580
So ICT, uh, s uh,

501
00:31:58,610 --> 00:32:02,250
to other information which are
becoming a available in order to reduce

502
00:32:02,251 --> 00:32:03,084
inflammation,

503
00:32:03,120 --> 00:32:07,110
which is very relevant but also integrated
in into all levels of society and

504
00:32:07,111 --> 00:32:11,100
therefore really being used for
everything on a daily scale.

505
00:32:11,580 --> 00:32:13,400
You see here a bit the scale from uh,

506
00:32:13,740 --> 00:32:18,120
a space 1.0 to 2.0 3.0 towards 4.0,

507
00:32:18,510 --> 00:32:23,010
but you would also know as new space
where you combine these various elements.

508
00:32:24,690 --> 00:32:29,340
What are these elements? What do you see
here? A new actors that suddenly came,

509
00:32:29,430 --> 00:32:31,500
uh, came to life and, uh,

510
00:32:31,760 --> 00:32:35,580
were introduced in the space domain which
did not exist before and have not been

511
00:32:35,581 --> 00:32:38,490
there before.
One of them very prominently Google.

512
00:32:39,230 --> 00:32:43,850
Google has been very active also in the
satellite to Maine with the Terra Bella.

513
00:32:43,851 --> 00:32:47,000
But, uh, this have been uh, sold.

514
00:32:47,440 --> 00:32:50,060
But with the Google Earth and Chin are,
um,

515
00:32:50,810 --> 00:32:55,250
are checked or Paul Graham really would
using an information source which will

516
00:32:55,251 --> 00:33:00,250
be of global value for everyone. Not
only decision makers, but everyone, uh,

517
00:33:00,470 --> 00:33:05,150
to provide up to date, uh, satellite
based information for various purposes,

518
00:33:05,690 --> 00:33:10,200
but also other players are coming,
uh, coming, uh, on the surface. Uh,

519
00:33:10,220 --> 00:33:12,050
we have planet not far from here.

520
00:33:12,410 --> 00:33:16,460
We have spire not far from here who are
building constellations of hundreds of

521
00:33:16,461 --> 00:33:20,380
satellites, which we didn't, didn't
have until a very few years ago. Uh,

522
00:33:20,410 --> 00:33:24,530
so that the landscape is really
changing very drastically in our domain.

523
00:33:24,890 --> 00:33:29,420
And this affects us all, uh, public
organizations like European Space Agency,

524
00:33:29,750 --> 00:33:33,260
but also private organizations which
are making good use of this data.

525
00:33:33,410 --> 00:33:38,360
And we are determined to really interact
very closely for the benefit of, uh,

526
00:33:39,170 --> 00:33:40,340
of, uh, the community.

527
00:33:41,570 --> 00:33:45,200
So what are we doing as Isa do
respond to these global challenges?

528
00:33:46,250 --> 00:33:48,870
We have organized actually or seminar,
um,

529
00:33:49,100 --> 00:33:52,510
in May,
2017 in fact,

530
00:33:52,520 --> 00:33:57,260
Scotty at European space agencies
eScreen facility near home in Italy,

531
00:33:57,710 --> 00:34:02,120
and we've invited some of the leading
experts in this new space, two maids.

532
00:34:02,121 --> 00:34:04,730
In those domains,
where are the biggest changes?

533
00:34:04,850 --> 00:34:09,710
The fastest changes are happening. We
have invited two types of people. One,

534
00:34:10,190 --> 00:34:15,020
uh, one group of people are CEOs or
leaders in building new constellations,

535
00:34:15,590 --> 00:34:19,520
satellite constellations with tens or
hundreds of satellites that are coming up.

536
00:34:20,120 --> 00:34:24,110
Another group of people who are working
with this data and converting them into

537
00:34:24,111 --> 00:34:27,490
information using ICT technology.

538
00:34:28,160 --> 00:34:32,550
And you see here the bottom hole on the
right hand side, a new El colleague,

539
00:34:32,650 --> 00:34:37,010
former Google earth engine who
was one of our key speakers.

540
00:34:37,310 --> 00:34:39,830
And uh,
him together with these colleagues,

541
00:34:40,130 --> 00:34:44,690
they're really showing us how
fast these developments are going.

542
00:34:45,080 --> 00:34:46,820
Uh,
what is happening in the world.

543
00:34:46,821 --> 00:34:51,680
And I have to say that our community
has been really woken up by this

544
00:34:52,190 --> 00:34:56,090
presentation. So it was actually
something that was a smaller revolution,

545
00:34:56,270 --> 00:35:00,700
at least in Europe, uh, to see how
fast this development go and, uh,

546
00:35:00,770 --> 00:35:03,320
what has to be done in order to remain,

547
00:35:03,380 --> 00:35:07,310
to remain relevant and to interact
with these communities. Uh,

548
00:35:07,520 --> 00:35:12,520
the event itself was a live podcast
or we had several tens of thousands of

549
00:35:12,591 --> 00:35:16,610
viewers, uh, not only the people
sitting in the home, but, uh, uh,

550
00:35:16,730 --> 00:35:19,790
people watching the movies
either life or afterwards.

551
00:35:20,030 --> 00:35:25,030
And this created quite a quite some
interest which also showed to us that we

552
00:35:26,211 --> 00:35:28,720
have to move and we have
to act in order to, uh,

553
00:35:28,820 --> 00:35:33,200
to stay on top of it and to connect with
these communities. Uh, what we have done,

554
00:35:33,201 --> 00:35:36,800
and this is something which
is more, um, specific to Esop,

555
00:35:36,801 --> 00:35:38,540
but it goes way beyond the czar.

556
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:44,000
I have created something called the
field lab fee for the Greek letter fee or

557
00:35:44,220 --> 00:35:48,990
like an English accent annunciation. We
call it fire lab, uh, which is uh, uh,

558
00:35:48,991 --> 00:35:53,991
an open space concept where you invite
people with different expertise,

559
00:35:54,630 --> 00:35:58,050
with different assets, bring
them together, work on a project,

560
00:35:58,140 --> 00:36:01,800
and then bring this expertise or this
knowledge back home to their company,

561
00:36:01,980 --> 00:36:06,370
to the institution in order to work on
specific problems. I'm inviting Google,

562
00:36:06,390 --> 00:36:10,020
but also many other partners to
come with us. Spent six months,

563
00:36:10,260 --> 00:36:15,060
one year or longer or shorter and identify
a project. Let me take an example.

564
00:36:16,370 --> 00:36:18,900
Uh, today in, at least in, in Asia,

565
00:36:19,140 --> 00:36:23,160
we are not yet using artificial
intelligence for the analysis of satellite

566
00:36:23,161 --> 00:36:23,994
images.

567
00:36:24,060 --> 00:36:29,060
But we know from other domains that this
is an area where huge progress is made.

568
00:36:29,860 --> 00:36:32,820
Uh, Google is one of the
key players in this domain,

569
00:36:32,821 --> 00:36:37,130
but there are quite a few are
very active, a very prominent, uh,

570
00:36:37,170 --> 00:36:38,700
companies are working on this.

571
00:36:39,120 --> 00:36:42,950
We know that this technology
will be very useful, uh,

572
00:36:43,170 --> 00:36:46,230
for satellite images.
They cloud covers one example,

573
00:36:46,290 --> 00:36:48,360
automatic detection of cloud cover,

574
00:36:48,630 --> 00:36:51,180
but also some features
related to agriculture,

575
00:36:51,400 --> 00:36:53,690
forestry to archeology.

576
00:36:54,090 --> 00:36:56,730
Too many parameters which
you can see satellite images,

577
00:36:56,970 --> 00:37:00,890
the huge amounts of data we are
producing require that uh, uh,

578
00:37:01,010 --> 00:37:04,170
artificial intelligence would
really help in identity in,

579
00:37:04,171 --> 00:37:05,970
in identifying some of these key features.

580
00:37:06,420 --> 00:37:08,990
Of course it always needs to
human intelligence, but, uh,

581
00:37:09,150 --> 00:37:12,620
because the volumes are so
huge, uh, it does also is,

582
00:37:12,720 --> 00:37:15,270
it is also required that we need to apply.
This means,

583
00:37:15,690 --> 00:37:19,230
and this is one example of where we
could say a Google with artificial

584
00:37:19,231 --> 00:37:24,231
intelligence Isa with with its knowledge
or for of satellite data interpretation

585
00:37:24,690 --> 00:37:29,010
and the access to its data
firsthand because we produce
a sending the data could

586
00:37:29,011 --> 00:37:33,660
work extremely well together and develop
algorithms, methods in order to help,

587
00:37:33,690 --> 00:37:36,600
uh,
developing methods to plan,

588
00:37:36,610 --> 00:37:40,590
to save our planet or to preserve our
planet with information which we provide.

589
00:37:40,710 --> 00:37:45,000
And that would hope that this is something
that would not only put a mirror to

590
00:37:45,001 --> 00:37:47,400
us what happens in technology development,

591
00:37:47,640 --> 00:37:51,960
but also to society and show them how
fast our planet is changing and what has

592
00:37:51,961 --> 00:37:53,430
to be done in order to surf it,

593
00:37:53,640 --> 00:37:57,530
which then leads to decisions that are
actually leading to a preservation of our

594
00:37:57,550 --> 00:37:59,910
planet.
Another example,

595
00:37:59,911 --> 00:38:04,911
which we are initiating now in terms of
addressing some of these issues is to

596
00:38:05,570 --> 00:38:07,420
together with European Commission,
uh,

597
00:38:07,470 --> 00:38:11,460
define a new satellite or
we call it sentinel seven,

598
00:38:11,820 --> 00:38:14,700
which would measure carbon dioxide,

599
00:38:14,820 --> 00:38:18,060
but at the scale where you can
really see where it comes from,

600
00:38:18,230 --> 00:38:21,780
a in order to have a more accurate
understanding of the sources.

601
00:38:22,110 --> 00:38:26,790
And therefore also what can be done to
reduce or minimize the sources or do you

602
00:38:26,791 --> 00:38:28,500
see here as a,
an animation,

603
00:38:28,660 --> 00:38:32,130
a simulation which does
not yet exist from space,

604
00:38:32,580 --> 00:38:36,490
but it shows how such a satellite
constellation could work at.

605
00:38:36,490 --> 00:38:41,050
You really can see where are the
sources of emissions, how do they,

606
00:38:41,410 --> 00:38:43,810
uh,
transport through the atmosphere,

607
00:38:43,930 --> 00:38:48,570
how did it mix up with other gasses and
what is the whole dynamics of greenhouse

608
00:38:48,580 --> 00:38:50,750
gases and how it works.
And this of course,

609
00:38:50,751 --> 00:38:53,770
it would be extremely relevant
information in the context of, uh,

610
00:38:54,190 --> 00:38:57,550
of the Paris agreement in the
context of global climate change.

611
00:38:58,840 --> 00:39:01,750
Actually in the context of really
seeing what happens to our planet.

612
00:39:02,080 --> 00:39:03,970
And this is something
we would like to pursue.

613
00:39:04,310 --> 00:39:07,090
A do a build up such a constellation,
a pub,

614
00:39:07,110 --> 00:39:09,040
you have three satellites
at the beginning, uh,

615
00:39:09,230 --> 00:39:12,150
in order to provide these measurements.
Uh, I dealt with the invasive,

616
00:39:13,480 --> 00:39:16,870
what'd you see on the right hand side
is actually the measurement of carbon

617
00:39:16,871 --> 00:39:17,780
dioxide.
A,

618
00:39:17,870 --> 00:39:22,870
they have been made by a fiscal various
sources in this case from 2002 to 2016.

619
00:39:24,480 --> 00:39:27,410
Uh, but the curve is a
very, as a very clear trend,

620
00:39:27,411 --> 00:39:30,020
the very clear direction
it goes upwards. And, uh,

621
00:39:30,040 --> 00:39:32,410
we need to contain this development,

622
00:39:34,570 --> 00:39:37,930
but also information from space
has to be useful for everyone.

623
00:39:38,040 --> 00:39:41,710
Or it has to go into devices which
you use every day. Mobile phones,

624
00:39:41,740 --> 00:39:46,260
tablets a, for example,
equality, sunshine, adulation,

625
00:39:46,550 --> 00:39:48,180
a smart farming values.

626
00:39:48,220 --> 00:39:52,700
Users should use this data in an
integrated fashion of not only, uh,

627
00:39:52,820 --> 00:39:56,260
using information from space,
but combining it with other data,

628
00:39:56,290 --> 00:40:00,400
without the measurements and with models
in order to really make it a daily

629
00:40:00,760 --> 00:40:04,370
asset, uh, daily. Uh, commodity, which
people use just as you are better,

630
00:40:04,371 --> 00:40:07,500
better forecast or any other information
you get on your mobile phones,

631
00:40:08,980 --> 00:40:13,870
you also supporting a APP camps,
hackathon's these type of things.

632
00:40:14,140 --> 00:40:19,140
But I'm also showing this is image here
because [inaudible] plex is a here seen

633
00:40:19,661 --> 00:40:22,510
from sentinel to which you've
known better where it is,

634
00:40:22,511 --> 00:40:24,460
but it's somebody at the center of,
of this image.

635
00:40:24,460 --> 00:40:27,370
But Google actually spreads
out or a much larger area.

636
00:40:27,670 --> 00:40:29,390
And this is one example of,
uh,

637
00:40:29,860 --> 00:40:34,860
of the satellite data showing the Salvia
here foresight or do we want to go,

638
00:40:35,651 --> 00:40:40,120
what do we think is a way where, uh,
the use of satellites will end up?

639
00:40:40,900 --> 00:40:44,830
And this is one example which shows
her what we call a control hall for

640
00:40:44,831 --> 00:40:48,550
spaceship Earth. It brings us back
to the beginning of the talk, right?

641
00:40:48,551 --> 00:40:51,460
We said that you earth
is a spaceship and uh,

642
00:40:51,730 --> 00:40:54,200
we are working at the frontier of,
um,

643
00:40:54,330 --> 00:40:59,330
of exploration and I think we should
establish a system that monitors the key

644
00:41:00,011 --> 00:41:04,840
parameters up our planet, uh, in order
to understand first of all what happens,

645
00:41:05,020 --> 00:41:09,490
but also to provide this awareness and
information with decision makers in order

646
00:41:09,491 --> 00:41:13,480
to make, to do everything in order to
preserve our planet. And with this,

647
00:41:13,481 --> 00:41:17,800
I want to thank you very much for
attention and I'm happy to answer any

648
00:41:17,801 --> 00:41:18,634
questions you may have.

649
00:41:20,600 --> 00:41:25,600
[inaudible]

650
00:41:28,970 --> 00:41:31,580
are there any missions that you've not
planned yet that you think would have a

651
00:41:31,581 --> 00:41:33,980
big impact or that you
wish in your own heart

652
00:41:33,980 --> 00:41:38,420
that you could do? Yes, there
are a number of missions. They,

653
00:41:38,421 --> 00:41:41,090
I met that many more missions
then, uh, then we have money.

654
00:41:42,200 --> 00:41:46,400
But there is in fact what we do is
we are testing a new methods or new

655
00:41:46,401 --> 00:41:48,020
technologies and that we are,

656
00:41:48,500 --> 00:41:52,940
we are developing new mission concepts
or we are having an internal catalog of

657
00:41:53,090 --> 00:41:56,870
some 50 of those missions are, which
really go across the whole of ancient,

658
00:41:56,871 --> 00:42:01,430
some of them I've shown carbon dioxide
as one of the next challenges are,

659
00:42:01,460 --> 00:42:05,360
which are we want to develop. But there
are also other missions that are using,

660
00:42:05,361 --> 00:42:08,420
for example,
a hyperspectral channels as we call them,

661
00:42:08,421 --> 00:42:11,960
which is not only 10 channels
are, are, uh, of, uh,

662
00:42:12,170 --> 00:42:13,960
of an immature but maybe handle it.

663
00:42:13,961 --> 00:42:18,020
So even several hundreds of of these
channels to have a very accurate, uh,

664
00:42:18,050 --> 00:42:21,250
distinction of the electromagnetic
spectrum and understand,

665
00:42:21,320 --> 00:42:23,840
understand extremely well
what happens on each year.

666
00:42:23,900 --> 00:42:27,800
A place of the wavelength in order
to have a better distinction between

667
00:42:28,040 --> 00:42:32,210
agricultural crops are used for mining,
different rock types and, and so on.

668
00:42:32,390 --> 00:42:35,750
We've got a much better or knowledge
of the, uh, of, of, of the,

669
00:42:36,080 --> 00:42:39,380
of the measurement on the surface.
But there are many applications,

670
00:42:39,381 --> 00:42:43,910
are many ideas which we have, uh, in
order to, to measure various parameters.

671
00:42:44,270 --> 00:42:47,180
I think one trend is, is clear, uh, uh,

672
00:42:47,570 --> 00:42:52,070
people would like more and more
up to date information, uh,

673
00:42:52,160 --> 00:42:55,370
of the state of the whole planet and
all the parameters of the planet.

674
00:42:55,371 --> 00:42:58,340
And this is really an information
they want frequently. Uh,

675
00:42:58,400 --> 00:43:02,420
we used to have satellite images once
every couple of weeks or maybe even months

676
00:43:02,421 --> 00:43:05,840
depending on, on what the
data were. And I think, uh,

677
00:43:05,880 --> 00:43:09,800
the population that really wants to see
a continuous evolution of what happens

678
00:43:09,830 --> 00:43:14,210
almost every day or even shorter than
this within the day of certain parameters.

679
00:43:14,250 --> 00:43:16,400
That's certainly a trend,
which is also very strong.

680
00:43:17,780 --> 00:43:20,310
Uh, so you talked a little
bit about, or you alluded to,

681
00:43:20,340 --> 00:43:24,270
companies like planet and spire that
are launching constellations of small

682
00:43:24,300 --> 00:43:27,080
spacecraft. Uh, but the, um, uh,

683
00:43:27,230 --> 00:43:30,660
the roadmap for the Copernicus
that you talked about, uh,

684
00:43:30,661 --> 00:43:35,661
is still primarily oriented
around launching large
satellite civic traditional

685
00:43:35,920 --> 00:43:36,390
story.

686
00:43:36,390 --> 00:43:41,390
How do you see a miniaturization of a
space technology and privatization of

687
00:43:41,401 --> 00:43:45,460
space technology changing how
organizations and like he said,

688
00:43:45,500 --> 00:43:47,670
do your own business,
uh, in the decades ahead.

689
00:43:48,470 --> 00:43:52,080
And this is an extremely good question
and that actually it's the main reason

690
00:43:52,320 --> 00:43:56,430
why have you organized this event I was
mentioning before who realize and make

691
00:43:56,431 --> 00:44:01,320
people realize what happens,
how fast these changes go.
And to question if I may,

692
00:44:01,650 --> 00:44:05,970
uh, whether the current approach is
the one that goes for the next 10, 20,

693
00:44:05,971 --> 00:44:10,740
or 30 years or we have to rethink
sometimes radically rethink our approach.

694
00:44:11,100 --> 00:44:15,150
And this is really at the core of,
uh, of the debate we are having.

695
00:44:15,390 --> 00:44:16,650
How does our ar,

696
00:44:16,920 --> 00:44:21,510
how do a missions that are built
by public institutions like Isa,

697
00:44:21,980 --> 00:44:25,110
uh, relate to these
constellations, uh, which are, uh,

698
00:44:25,111 --> 00:44:28,320
have very different nature in terms of
satellites and information they provide.

699
00:44:29,160 --> 00:44:33,390
My personal opinion is it
always need high quality,

700
00:44:33,510 --> 00:44:35,400
highly calibrated reference missions,

701
00:44:35,730 --> 00:44:39,600
which to private industry may not
want to engage because simply they are

702
00:44:39,710 --> 00:44:43,050
inexpensive and very complicated,
a complex due to build.

703
00:44:43,110 --> 00:44:47,760
And therefore the business case may not
be as well as so evident as you might

704
00:44:47,761 --> 00:44:49,710
imagine. However, uh,

705
00:44:49,890 --> 00:44:53,950
there are gaps to be filled and really
gaps meaning in the sense of of embolic

706
00:44:53,970 --> 00:44:55,920
acquisitions,
acquisitions for example,

707
00:44:55,921 --> 00:44:59,690
our sentinels are covering
the globe every five days. Uh,

708
00:44:59,820 --> 00:45:01,800
we learned from planet that they need,
uh,

709
00:45:01,801 --> 00:45:05,190
information every day or
even within the day. Uh,

710
00:45:05,191 --> 00:45:09,300
so very frequent observations.
Therefore they are closing a time gap,

711
00:45:09,780 --> 00:45:12,640
but they're also improving the resolution.
Uh,

712
00:45:12,660 --> 00:45:17,570
our satellites are having 10 meters
solution with a very wide swath planet.

713
00:45:17,580 --> 00:45:22,360
Satellites are going down at the moment,
the dose, three to four meters. But, uh,

714
00:45:22,420 --> 00:45:27,310
the newer generations skysat below one
meter. And this is something which is a,

715
00:45:27,311 --> 00:45:30,060
an a complimentary information. And, uh,

716
00:45:30,090 --> 00:45:34,110
personally I think the combination of
these publicly funded reference missions

717
00:45:34,410 --> 00:45:37,380
and privately funded or mission.

718
00:45:37,381 --> 00:45:41,640
So constellations is extremely useful
and I think there's a lot of work to be

719
00:45:41,641 --> 00:45:44,550
done in order to integrate those
data sets and use them together.

720
00:45:46,050 --> 00:45:50,450
So you showed a slide with the
whole constellation of sensors,

721
00:45:50,510 --> 00:45:52,050
the current and into the future.

722
00:45:52,770 --> 00:45:57,770
And I think the concern is that
with that volume of data will be uh,

723
00:45:59,660 --> 00:46:02,310
you know, drowning in data,
thirsty for knowledge.

724
00:46:03,060 --> 00:46:05,970
Where do you see the
role of space agencies,

725
00:46:05,971 --> 00:46:09,750
NASA East said Jaxa in bridging that gap.

726
00:46:09,870 --> 00:46:14,870
And do you think that's a proper role
for these agencies or is that more of an

727
00:46:14,941 --> 00:46:18,090
academic and or private sector activity?

728
00:46:18,650 --> 00:46:22,490
Okay, then I said, well, um, aspects of
this question, which is actually a very,

729
00:46:22,700 --> 00:46:27,580
a very relevant one. Uh, today we are
producing are extremely high volumes of,

730
00:46:27,581 --> 00:46:29,240
of data.
Um,

731
00:46:29,300 --> 00:46:34,300
actually the sentinel program is the
third largest user of data in the world to

732
00:46:35,870 --> 00:46:38,230
express it in more common terms.

733
00:46:38,420 --> 00:46:43,420
The amount of data we would use every
day with our sentinels is more than all

734
00:46:43,611 --> 00:46:46,460
the photos, all the videos
uploaded on Facebook every day.

735
00:46:46,880 --> 00:46:50,510
So it's huge amounts of data which we
are managing and which we are producing

736
00:46:51,230 --> 00:46:54,950
and we need to help offer
our larger ICT companies,

737
00:46:55,160 --> 00:46:58,160
Google and others to really
make good use of these data.

738
00:46:58,520 --> 00:47:02,270
The data itself is of course fantastic
because they provide the baseline of the

739
00:47:02,271 --> 00:47:03,104
observations.

740
00:47:03,380 --> 00:47:08,030
But the real value is converting this
data and information and this is where a

741
00:47:08,031 --> 00:47:10,400
company's coming,
commercial companies in particular,

742
00:47:10,550 --> 00:47:13,220
we convert this or this
data into information.

743
00:47:13,220 --> 00:47:16,050
And this for me would be one
of the biggest challenges, uh,

744
00:47:16,070 --> 00:47:20,270
in the years to come to do,
to manage this massive amount of data.

745
00:47:20,540 --> 00:47:25,100
It's not enough just to screen them.
You need a automatic methods,

746
00:47:25,130 --> 00:47:26,270
artificial intelligence,

747
00:47:26,271 --> 00:47:28,880
but also other methods in order
to really make good use of use.

748
00:47:29,900 --> 00:47:31,670
I'm coming from Australia and maybe uh,

749
00:47:32,220 --> 00:47:35,180
I take a small anecdote of mortality,

750
00:47:35,590 --> 00:47:40,590
well known decision and he at some
point was looking at a piece of,

751
00:47:42,670 --> 00:47:47,440
uh, of a compensation of one of
his competitor or fellow musicians.

752
00:47:47,920 --> 00:47:52,270
And he was looking at it. He said, there
are too many notes. This is too many data.

753
00:47:52,300 --> 00:47:56,710
Too many notes. It don't make sense.
They don't sound good. The trick is,

754
00:47:56,711 --> 00:48:00,760
or the challenges to pick out the right
notes with them and the right place and

755
00:48:00,761 --> 00:48:04,030
make a nice melody. And that's what he
did. And I think we have the same problem.

756
00:48:04,031 --> 00:48:06,460
We have a lot of data,
not saying too many,

757
00:48:06,461 --> 00:48:10,420
but a lot of data and picking out the
right pieces of information and putting

758
00:48:10,421 --> 00:48:13,750
them into context is the challenge
of the next years to come there.

759
00:48:13,780 --> 00:48:16,330
We need to work a lot altogether
and not on the east side.

760
00:48:16,340 --> 00:48:19,870
This is a work which you're a space
agencies have to do with private industry

761
00:48:19,871 --> 00:48:21,570
and with a lot of other partners.

762
00:48:23,140 --> 00:48:28,140
My question is is on a low d technology
that's using the satellite requires

763
00:48:30,191 --> 00:48:35,191
really deep knowledge like the saw they
talk about and hyperspectral and a lot

764
00:48:35,311 --> 00:48:40,270
of this requires many years
of specialization but two
main use of the data more

765
00:48:40,271 --> 00:48:40,870
meaningfully.

766
00:48:40,870 --> 00:48:45,780
Do you think we need to preach the
Tenneco get between the experts and other

767
00:48:45,800 --> 00:48:50,380
solvers in ICT? Is we're more comfortable
with maybe like machine learning,

768
00:48:50,381 --> 00:48:51,214
artificial intelligence,

769
00:48:51,610 --> 00:48:55,750
but might not have the knowledge to
exploit the data generated by these

770
00:48:55,751 --> 00:48:56,584
satellites?
Yeah,

771
00:48:57,200 --> 00:48:58,540
a very good point.
Um,

772
00:48:58,670 --> 00:49:02,450
I think there are different types of
answers to your question because there is

773
00:49:02,451 --> 00:49:06,830
some data which can easily be integrated
using, I would say computing power.

774
00:49:07,250 --> 00:49:08,850
If you take a,
uh,

775
00:49:08,960 --> 00:49:13,340
an imaging sensor and you
compare changes before and after,

776
00:49:13,640 --> 00:49:18,110
you can easily see a difference between
one day and another, uh, simply because,

777
00:49:18,140 --> 00:49:22,700
uh, forest area has been deforested or
a building has been built or something

778
00:49:22,701 --> 00:49:24,440
happened and you can easily detected,

779
00:49:24,470 --> 00:49:29,470
I would say almost automatically with
ICT technology and this is maybe the

780
00:49:29,481 --> 00:49:30,260
simpler case,

781
00:49:30,260 --> 00:49:34,500
but there will be a lot which you can
do with relatively simple means, uh,

782
00:49:34,550 --> 00:49:37,070
in using this data, there's other, uh,

783
00:49:37,220 --> 00:49:41,000
use of this data which requires
very high knowledge expertise.

784
00:49:41,360 --> 00:49:45,720
I showed some of the examples before
our, what we call interferometry, uh,

785
00:49:45,980 --> 00:49:49,310
that you can detect actually
changes in height at the surface.

786
00:49:49,640 --> 00:49:51,670
And there you need really
the expertise of, uh,

787
00:49:51,810 --> 00:49:55,310
of remote sensing or Earth observation
expert in order to interpret,

788
00:49:55,340 --> 00:49:59,080
to calculate, interpret this data. So
it, it needs a combination of both.

789
00:49:59,280 --> 00:50:03,320
Like always, if you really want
to maximize the use of these data,

790
00:50:03,470 --> 00:50:05,060
you need the expertise.
In one side,

791
00:50:05,240 --> 00:50:08,690
but also the means on the other side and
the means. In this case it's really ICT.

792
00:50:10,790 --> 00:50:15,640
So I notice the focus on where all the
effort is monitoring planet has been

793
00:50:15,641 --> 00:50:20,620
largely Europe and North America focused
both the state agencies and the private

794
00:50:20,621 --> 00:50:21,880
sector.
Um,

795
00:50:21,940 --> 00:50:26,940
how much do we need other parts of the
world to get engaged and how much does it

796
00:50:27,771 --> 00:50:30,020
matter given that the
satellites are actually global?

797
00:50:31,410 --> 00:50:33,310
That's to say a satellites
are global by nature.

798
00:50:33,340 --> 00:50:37,510
So a satellite doesn't only stay over
America or what you hope over certain

799
00:50:37,511 --> 00:50:41,710
country is circling down to earth and
therefore really take images of the whole

800
00:50:41,711 --> 00:50:45,970
globe. So by nature, it's a global
issue which requires all departments.

801
00:50:46,720 --> 00:50:47,740
Uh, I think, um,

802
00:50:47,830 --> 00:50:51,880
I think one good example or where we
should really underlines that you need

803
00:50:51,881 --> 00:50:52,990
everyone,
uh,

804
00:50:53,020 --> 00:50:58,020
or the major players to work together a
tech CEO to carbon dioxide measurements,

805
00:50:58,540 --> 00:51:00,550
which is not an isolated problem because,

806
00:51:00,551 --> 00:51:03,220
so if you pollute here and
don't pollute their, uh,

807
00:51:03,221 --> 00:51:07,390
it's no good because if the pollution
goes from here to there and therefore, uh,

808
00:51:07,420 --> 00:51:10,150
the effect of the clean
country or clean area,

809
00:51:10,420 --> 00:51:13,800
it's not working because the
pollution comes from [inaudible],

810
00:51:14,130 --> 00:51:16,470
which transports it. So you need the, the,

811
00:51:16,500 --> 00:51:19,330
the various countries or
regions to work together. Uh,

812
00:51:19,331 --> 00:51:24,331
even if you have to say is we want
to be pioneers in measuring a CEO to,

813
00:51:24,700 --> 00:51:25,533
for example,

814
00:51:25,630 --> 00:51:29,380
to better understand the flux is in
the atmosphere and to see what are the

815
00:51:29,510 --> 00:51:33,820
impacts on climate change.
It's not enough. You hope
you sir, small piece on the,

816
00:51:34,270 --> 00:51:36,040
on the whole globe.
And it requires everyone.

817
00:51:36,420 --> 00:51:40,870
And that's why we really want to engage
with all the major space nations,

818
00:51:41,160 --> 00:51:45,010
with Jaxa, with Japanese, with
the Chinese, with America,

819
00:51:45,880 --> 00:51:46,990
our European partners,

820
00:51:46,991 --> 00:51:50,590
to create a global system because only
a global system is really something that

821
00:51:50,591 --> 00:51:52,300
is sustainable and make sense?

822
00:51:53,590 --> 00:51:57,590
Hmm. I think we were all very inspired
by the vision you articulated in the

823
00:51:57,591 --> 00:52:00,590
commitment coming out of Europe,
the European Space Agency,

824
00:52:00,920 --> 00:52:05,210
to monitoring the planet going out
decades for the benefit of all of us at a

825
00:52:05,211 --> 00:52:09,160
time when it is critically important.
So my question for you is,

826
00:52:09,161 --> 00:52:12,650
it's more personal when you're
turning these pixels to knowledge.

827
00:52:12,950 --> 00:52:17,090
Some of that knowledge is rather
dark, that is discovered, melting,

828
00:52:17,360 --> 00:52:22,190
polarize desertification, you
know, loss of air quality,

829
00:52:22,220 --> 00:52:25,760
uh, all sorts of issues.
How do you maintain,

830
00:52:26,090 --> 00:52:31,090
can you maintain optimism for yourself
and your 500 plus person team in the face

831
00:52:31,851 --> 00:52:33,200
of,
of all this?

832
00:52:33,990 --> 00:52:37,100
Um, indeed, it's toward
that. Sometimes you,

833
00:52:37,160 --> 00:52:40,490
when you monitor closely the
state and evolution of our planet,

834
00:52:40,910 --> 00:52:45,190
the news is no good news. Uh, because of
you see how it degrades, how it, uh, uh,

835
00:52:45,250 --> 00:52:48,470
it is being destroyed. How the
pollution affects various elements,

836
00:52:48,471 --> 00:52:52,680
how climate change increases temperature
increases, c level of ice increases.

837
00:52:52,690 --> 00:52:57,470
I'm told them this is no good news
on the other side of our planet is so

838
00:52:57,471 --> 00:52:58,304
beautiful.

839
00:52:58,580 --> 00:53:03,410
And we once had an exhibition where
we put together some of our sentinel

840
00:53:03,650 --> 00:53:07,670
satellite images mostly from Sentinel's
but not only and have put them on the

841
00:53:07,671 --> 00:53:09,680
ball. Uh, and uh, the,

842
00:53:09,760 --> 00:53:13,760
the title of this exhibition was
beauty and fragility of our planet.

843
00:53:14,120 --> 00:53:18,290
And it is so to our planet is so
beautiful, especially seen from space,

844
00:53:18,470 --> 00:53:19,460
but it's also fat child.

845
00:53:19,820 --> 00:53:23,840
And I think this fragility is the one
that wants you to protect it because at

846
00:53:23,841 --> 00:53:27,000
the end it is your living space. It is
our living space which we need to protect.

847
00:53:27,630 --> 00:53:32,480
So, and to answer your question, yes,
there is a lot of dangerous or are,

848
00:53:32,490 --> 00:53:36,600
which we all threats which we see
every day. However, stepping back,

849
00:53:36,601 --> 00:53:38,460
the planet has so much beauty to offer,

850
00:53:38,461 --> 00:53:41,840
and I think this is really giving you
the optimism you need in order to really

851
00:53:41,850 --> 00:53:46,650
enjoy this, uh, looking at these images
every day. Thank you very much. Thank you.

852
00:53:46,910 --> 00:53:51,910
[inaudible].
