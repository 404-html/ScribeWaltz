1
00:00:05,470 --> 00:00:09,820
Hadi partovi is a tech entrepreneur,
an investor, and the CEO of Education,

2
00:00:09,821 --> 00:00:13,570
nonprofit code.org. Born in Tehran, Iran.

3
00:00:13,990 --> 00:00:17,200
How they grew up during the Iran,
Iraq war is high school,

4
00:00:17,201 --> 00:00:19,300
did not offer computer science classes.

5
00:00:19,450 --> 00:00:24,450
So he taught himself to code at home on
a commodore 64 after immigrating to the

6
00:00:25,001 --> 00:00:25,721
United States.

7
00:00:25,721 --> 00:00:30,580
He has spent his summers working as a
software engineer to help pay his way

8
00:00:30,581 --> 00:00:31,500
through that,
uh,

9
00:00:31,630 --> 00:00:36,280
his college and high school and graduating
from Harvard with a master's degree

10
00:00:36,281 --> 00:00:39,710
in computer science. How they pursue
the Caribbean and technology, uh,

11
00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:44,290
companies like Microsoft word.
He rose to the executory ranks.

12
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:49,300
He founded two startups. The first one
was a huge success and the second ad,

13
00:00:49,301 --> 00:00:54,070
the small failure. And now he invests
in advisors, other technology startups.

14
00:00:55,270 --> 00:00:56,410
In 2013,

15
00:00:56,440 --> 00:01:01,440
Huddy and his twin brother Ali launched
education nonprofit code.org we had,

16
00:01:01,620 --> 00:01:05,720
Heidi continues to lead
full time as CEO could.

17
00:01:05,730 --> 00:01:10,030
Dot Org has established computer science
classes in 20% of the u s classrooms

18
00:01:10,031 --> 00:01:15,031
created the most broadly used curriculum
platform for k 12 computer science and

19
00:01:15,731 --> 00:01:19,480
launched the global hour of the code
movement that has reached over a hundred

20
00:01:19,480 --> 00:01:20,313
million students.

21
00:01:20,510 --> 00:01:24,700
How'd he has served as an early
advisor or investor at many things,

22
00:01:24,701 --> 00:01:28,930
startups including Facebook,
Dropbox, Airbnb, and Uber.

23
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:32,620
He currently serves on the board
of directors of Exxon and convey,

24
00:01:33,220 --> 00:01:37,660
so please join me welcoming
Hadi Partovi to speak for us.

25
00:01:38,090 --> 00:01:38,923
Thank you.

26
00:01:40,430 --> 00:01:43,520
Our vision is that every student in every
school should have the opportunity to

27
00:01:43,521 --> 00:01:44,720
learn computer science.

28
00:01:44,780 --> 00:01:49,580
I like probably many of you began
learning on my own at home, which was how,

29
00:01:49,850 --> 00:01:52,760
you know, in the eighties or nineties,
people started learning computer science.

30
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:56,420
But in the 21st century, this is the field
that everybody should have access to.

31
00:01:56,780 --> 00:02:01,500
Uh, I start my presentations by talking
about why this is important. Uh,

32
00:02:01,580 --> 00:02:04,820
and most audiences have some
inkling of why it's important.

33
00:02:04,821 --> 00:02:05,800
I would expect her Google,
it's,

34
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:09,500
it's not a very hard pitch to explain
that people should learn computer science,

35
00:02:09,501 --> 00:02:12,800
but some of the statistics behind
it still surprise people who just

36
00:02:12,801 --> 00:02:14,840
automatically believe computer
science should be taught.

37
00:02:15,320 --> 00:02:18,380
There's three reasons for teaching
computer science to students.

38
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:21,230
One is for economic
opportunity in their careers.

39
00:02:21,530 --> 00:02:23,930
The second is to give them
a well rounded education.

40
00:02:24,200 --> 00:02:26,240
And the third is to help make school fun.

41
00:02:26,550 --> 00:02:28,820
And I want to go into each of
these in a little bit of depth.

42
00:02:29,160 --> 00:02:33,830
So talking about opportunity
is the easiest case for
teaching computer science.

43
00:02:34,020 --> 00:02:34,220
Uh,

44
00:02:34,220 --> 00:02:38,660
computing has become not only the fastest
growing and highest peck paying sector

45
00:02:38,661 --> 00:02:39,494
of wages,

46
00:02:39,500 --> 00:02:44,090
but it's now become the largest sector of
all new wages in the United States. Uh,

47
00:02:44,330 --> 00:02:46,520
and this is not just in California,
in Washington,

48
00:02:46,521 --> 00:02:49,050
it's in every industry in
every single state. Uh,

49
00:02:49,190 --> 00:02:53,510
this is a picture showing the breakdown
of all new wages in the country in

50
00:02:53,511 --> 00:02:56,510
currently open jobs.
So not people who are currently working,

51
00:02:56,511 --> 00:03:00,010
but the opportunity to get hired,
looking at where the salaries are,

52
00:03:00,220 --> 00:03:03,670
the biggest sector is not computing.
This hasn't always been the case.

53
00:03:03,880 --> 00:03:07,750
It's also the fastest growing slice
of the pie. So it's uh, you know,

54
00:03:07,751 --> 00:03:10,750
as we hear about computing work,
automating other jobs,

55
00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:14,040
this is the one part of the job pie
that is actually growing and it's,

56
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:18,020
it's gradually becoming a larger
and larger slice of the Pie. Uh,

57
00:03:18,340 --> 00:03:22,570
it's also the best paying, uh, area
of, of work in the United States.

58
00:03:22,810 --> 00:03:23,950
In fact,
the,

59
00:03:23,951 --> 00:03:28,330
this graph compares the lifetime earnings
of a high school graduate versus a

60
00:03:28,331 --> 00:03:32,200
university graduate versus a university
computer science graduate. Uh,

61
00:03:32,260 --> 00:03:35,470
the difference between the second two
is almost as big as the first two.

62
00:03:35,830 --> 00:03:39,110
So congrats to all of you here who
are computer science graduates, uh,

63
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:41,150
to be in that third bucket.
Um,

64
00:03:41,860 --> 00:03:45,670
but the jobs and career opportunities
aren't the only reason to be teaching

65
00:03:45,671 --> 00:03:48,070
computer science. Uh, in the 21st century.

66
00:03:48,071 --> 00:03:52,090
Computer Science is foundational for
every child regardless of what career they

67
00:03:52,091 --> 00:03:56,980
go into. Uh, the best example I make is
when I was going through high school,

68
00:03:56,981 --> 00:04:00,340
every student would learn how
the digestive system works,

69
00:04:00,520 --> 00:04:05,080
how a light bulb is turned
on using electricity or that
a squared plus B squared

70
00:04:05,081 --> 00:04:08,500
is c squared. In many cases these
students aren't going to become, you know,

71
00:04:08,620 --> 00:04:10,840
electricians or mathematicians.

72
00:04:10,840 --> 00:04:14,920
It's just part of learning how the world
around us works and being well rounded.

73
00:04:15,070 --> 00:04:16,390
Uh,
in today's age,

74
00:04:16,391 --> 00:04:20,590
understanding what an algorithm is
or how the Internet works is equally

75
00:04:20,591 --> 00:04:21,251
foundational.

76
00:04:21,251 --> 00:04:25,540
These are things that students and adults
use every single day and not having

77
00:04:25,541 --> 00:04:28,570
the most basic understanding
leaves people out in the dark.

78
00:04:29,830 --> 00:04:33,050
I'm not the only person saying
this. Taking back to one of my, uh,

79
00:04:33,730 --> 00:04:36,700
personal sort of role
models over 20 years ago,

80
00:04:36,701 --> 00:04:39,310
Steve Jobs said computer
science is a liberal art.

81
00:04:39,580 --> 00:04:42,490
It's something that everybody should
learn, take a year in their life,

82
00:04:42,700 --> 00:04:45,590
one of the courses they take because
it teaches you how to think. Ah,

83
00:04:45,630 --> 00:04:47,830
it's been 20 something
years since he said that.

84
00:04:48,100 --> 00:04:51,250
And still the majority of America's
schools don't offer a single course in

85
00:04:51,251 --> 00:04:53,740
computer science hat.
Last year,

86
00:04:53,741 --> 00:04:57,160
President Obama also supported this call
to action saying in the new economy,

87
00:04:57,161 --> 00:05:02,140
computer science is no longer an optional
skill. It's a basic skill. Uh, and again,

88
00:05:02,170 --> 00:05:05,710
the problem we're trying to solve
is the majority of America schools,

89
00:05:05,740 --> 00:05:06,880
whether elementary,
middle,

90
00:05:06,881 --> 00:05:11,740
or high schools don't offer any computer
science courses at the other reason

91
00:05:11,741 --> 00:05:14,950
this is irrelevant and this is probably
the one that is most personal to me.

92
00:05:14,951 --> 00:05:15,910
And there's a,

93
00:05:15,911 --> 00:05:20,420
it's harder to sort of make a case for
is to help make school fun again. Uh,

94
00:05:20,500 --> 00:05:25,420
and what I say is, you know, most of
you have left school a while back.

95
00:05:25,570 --> 00:05:27,940
If you look at today's students in school,
they increasingly,

96
00:05:27,941 --> 00:05:29,590
it feels like they're being forced,

97
00:05:29,591 --> 00:05:33,490
fed to memorize stuff that doesn't
really matter. Uh, you know,

98
00:05:33,491 --> 00:05:38,240
if you're the child of a single
income ma, you know, sorry,

99
00:05:38,260 --> 00:05:42,070
a single parent who's like maybe working
in a Mcdonald's and your other parent

100
00:05:42,071 --> 00:05:45,760
is working in a parking lot and nobody
you knew went to college and then you're

101
00:05:45,761 --> 00:05:49,630
at school memorizing the capitals of
countries you'll never visit or you know,

102
00:05:49,631 --> 00:05:53,920
the histories of something from hundreds
of years ago. It just doesn't relate,

103
00:05:53,950 --> 00:05:57,980
especially since most of the information
you learned in school a could do for

104
00:05:57,981 --> 00:05:58,641
you.
You know,

105
00:05:58,641 --> 00:06:02,480
you're learning long division in fourth
grade and you have a calculator you know,

106
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:06,080
easily that could do the same thing
as what you're learning to do. Uh,

107
00:06:06,180 --> 00:06:08,900
so most kids don't find
school very engaging.

108
00:06:09,110 --> 00:06:13,010
Most teachers also feel like it's this
process where there's continuous testing

109
00:06:13,011 --> 00:06:16,280
and teaching to the test. The whole
school system doesn't feel very fun.

110
00:06:16,640 --> 00:06:19,790
Meanwhile, computer science
is Super Fun for today's kids.

111
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:24,290
These are some examples of what students
say about using code.org to learn

112
00:06:24,410 --> 00:06:28,400
computer science saying, I loved it
purely and wholly. It was fun to do.

113
00:06:28,401 --> 00:06:32,000
I want to do that over and over again.
I really enjoyed what I could do with it.

114
00:06:32,001 --> 00:06:34,610
I enjoyed the interactivity
and how it felt to control it.

115
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:37,700
It felt really satisfying.
I wish we could do that every day.

116
00:06:38,150 --> 00:06:40,670
That's something that's, and that's
a middle school student in Idaho.

117
00:06:40,940 --> 00:06:45,600
That's something that no
students says about most of
school, pretty much ever. Uh,

118
00:06:45,640 --> 00:06:47,060
and so when teachers feel this,

119
00:06:47,061 --> 00:06:50,450
they automatically realize
this is something slightly
different than the other

120
00:06:50,451 --> 00:06:52,760
stuff they're teaching
in the classroom. Uh, or,

121
00:06:52,820 --> 00:06:56,180
or a teacher from New York saying our
students have asked to have an hour every

122
00:06:56,181 --> 00:06:56,840
week,

123
00:06:56,840 --> 00:07:00,500
which is again the type of demand you
don't hear for most of the other courses

124
00:07:00,501 --> 00:07:02,030
in the school system.
Um,

125
00:07:02,270 --> 00:07:05,570
this is from a teacher in Florida
talking about AP computer science.

126
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:07,820
His students saying,
this is crazy fun.

127
00:07:07,821 --> 00:07:10,430
I'm pretty much going to tell all
my friends to take this class.

128
00:07:10,670 --> 00:07:11,550
And that's kids in,

129
00:07:11,551 --> 00:07:16,010
in Florida talking about
taking AP computer science
that the students interest

130
00:07:16,011 --> 00:07:19,310
in computer science is the most important
reason that our schools should be

131
00:07:19,311 --> 00:07:21,130
offering this. Um, and then my,

132
00:07:21,410 --> 00:07:24,140
this is one of my favorites is
a teacher saying that, you know,

133
00:07:24,350 --> 00:07:26,060
today's project was a slam dunk.

134
00:07:26,330 --> 00:07:29,600
Students came in right away and started
talking about it before the bell rang.

135
00:07:29,900 --> 00:07:31,820
In fact,
when I tried to start the class,

136
00:07:31,821 --> 00:07:33,380
the students that I was
trying to quiet down,

137
00:07:33,381 --> 00:07:35,670
we're already talking about their project.
Uh,

138
00:07:35,960 --> 00:07:40,790
we regularly hear about teachers using
coding as the sort of candy in the

139
00:07:40,791 --> 00:07:41,900
classroom saying, you know, you,

140
00:07:42,110 --> 00:07:45,420
you can't do the coding until you
finish your math homework or you know,

141
00:07:45,740 --> 00:07:48,020
kids not wanting to go to
recess because they're so,

142
00:07:48,021 --> 00:07:50,690
so engaged doing computer science.
Um,

143
00:07:51,080 --> 00:07:54,980
the now a national measure of this was
actually done by a group that was trying

144
00:07:54,981 --> 00:07:59,120
to uh, understand how to get students
more interested in biology. Uh,

145
00:07:59,240 --> 00:08:02,930
this biology survey went out to try
and find out why aren't kids enjoying

146
00:08:02,931 --> 00:08:06,590
biology? And they asked students what
are the subjects they like the most? Uh,

147
00:08:06,591 --> 00:08:09,210
it turns out biology wasn't
very high on the list. Uh,

148
00:08:09,320 --> 00:08:13,400
but computer science ended up being
number three just behind art and basically

149
00:08:13,401 --> 00:08:16,130
music and dance. So art, music, dance.

150
00:08:16,131 --> 00:08:20,120
And then computer sciences is in the
third category in terms of students most

151
00:08:20,121 --> 00:08:23,940
favorite subject to learn.
Uh, which is awesome. Uh,

152
00:08:24,020 --> 00:08:25,340
but it then begs the question,

153
00:08:25,341 --> 00:08:28,310
if this leads to the best
paying jobs in the country,

154
00:08:28,490 --> 00:08:30,860
the largest source of
economic opportunity.

155
00:08:31,100 --> 00:08:34,250
And it's also among the top
favorite things kids want to learn.

156
00:08:34,490 --> 00:08:36,480
Why aren't our schools teaching it?
Uh,

157
00:08:36,770 --> 00:08:40,680
and that's basically the
problem that code.org has
been setting out to solve. Um,

158
00:08:41,250 --> 00:08:41,920
the examples,

159
00:08:41,920 --> 00:08:46,040
just this is probably easy for you to
understand why computer science is fun,

160
00:08:46,041 --> 00:08:50,090
but these are examples of things students
have created in elementary school

161
00:08:50,091 --> 00:08:53,810
classrooms, in middle school classrooms
or in high school classrooms.

162
00:08:53,990 --> 00:08:57,090
These are basically apps that kids
make on the code.org platform.

163
00:08:57,390 --> 00:08:59,280
And what's exciting
about it is for the kids,

164
00:08:59,281 --> 00:09:01,650
they're making something
just like an art class.

165
00:09:01,890 --> 00:09:05,220
It's something they can take home or put
on their phones and show their teachers

166
00:09:05,400 --> 00:09:06,810
or show their parents and friends.

167
00:09:07,170 --> 00:09:10,650
And yet at the same time to build these
things, you need to learn about angles.

168
00:09:10,651 --> 00:09:14,460
You need to learn about velocity or
acceleration concepts you learned in other

169
00:09:14,461 --> 00:09:16,770
classes,
but in a much more creative way.

170
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:21,480
Fundamentally, I asked for any
of the kids entering school,

171
00:09:21,481 --> 00:09:25,380
especially if you envision somebody
entering kindergarten this school year,

172
00:09:25,530 --> 00:09:29,100
they're going to be graduating from
university in the year 2030 what are their

173
00:09:29,101 --> 00:09:30,330
career's going to look like?

174
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:34,260
I used to say that unless you want to
get a job flipping burgers or driving

175
00:09:34,261 --> 00:09:36,900
trucks, he should learn
something about technology.

176
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:41,070
It turns out there's now robots that
flip burgers and trucks that drive

177
00:09:41,071 --> 00:09:41,904
themselves.

178
00:09:41,970 --> 00:09:45,480
There's literally not a single career
you can imagine in 2030 that's not going

179
00:09:45,481 --> 00:09:49,020
to be impacted somehow by technology
and our schools should teach something

180
00:09:49,021 --> 00:09:54,021
about how that technology works between
all the problems we have in America

181
00:09:54,391 --> 00:09:54,661
today,

182
00:09:54,661 --> 00:09:58,140
especially looking at what's happened
on the political spectrum and how much

183
00:09:58,141 --> 00:10:02,760
Americans are concerned about opportunity
and the American dream and the rich

184
00:10:02,761 --> 00:10:05,490
poor income divide and all
these issues in our country.

185
00:10:05,820 --> 00:10:07,620
I believe if you think about our future,

186
00:10:07,830 --> 00:10:11,010
teaching computer science to our students
is among the most important thing we

187
00:10:11,011 --> 00:10:13,260
can do for the children.
For our children.

188
00:10:13,500 --> 00:10:16,260
And what's awesome about is it's
also not politically charged.

189
00:10:16,261 --> 00:10:17,850
Like many of the other things we could do.

190
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:22,560
This is something that everybody agrees
with on both sides of the aisle. Now,

191
00:10:22,770 --> 00:10:24,390
unlike most nonprofits,

192
00:10:24,690 --> 00:10:28,710
we don't just talk about our idea as an
opportunity or as a problem that we're

193
00:10:28,711 --> 00:10:29,580
trying to solve.

194
00:10:29,890 --> 00:10:33,990
A that doesn't have results were extremely
lucky to be working on something that

195
00:10:33,991 --> 00:10:38,660
has incredible results and has turned
into a global teacher led movement, uh,

196
00:10:38,940 --> 00:10:41,940
with frankly stunning results for
something working in education.

197
00:10:42,210 --> 00:10:46,350
When I started code.org, pretty
much everybody told me, you know,

198
00:10:46,530 --> 00:10:49,860
you should start a summer camp or
make an afterschool club or try to do

199
00:10:49,861 --> 00:10:53,310
something online. And what they were
really saying, they weren't saying this,

200
00:10:53,311 --> 00:10:57,360
they were just implicitly thinking, don't
try to change the public school system.

201
00:10:57,630 --> 00:10:59,610
I think people were just
implicitly ignoring that.

202
00:10:59,611 --> 00:11:04,020
We have this trillion dollar a year
system that has 50 million students in it

203
00:11:04,260 --> 00:11:05,250
that never changes.

204
00:11:05,251 --> 00:11:09,480
So let's figure out some end run way of
teaching computer science outside of the

205
00:11:09,481 --> 00:11:10,314
school system.

206
00:11:10,620 --> 00:11:13,620
And we took the approach that the
school system needs to modernize.

207
00:11:13,621 --> 00:11:14,760
This is the chance to do it.

208
00:11:15,090 --> 00:11:19,140
And what's enabled that has been the
teachers that support this work. Uh,

209
00:11:19,740 --> 00:11:24,270
this is a picture of all the teachers
that love code.org had, I'm just kidding.

210
00:11:24,271 --> 00:11:26,580
It's a rock concert. Uh, but, uh,

211
00:11:26,700 --> 00:11:30,660
the reason I show this picture is the
number of teachers that support code.org

212
00:11:30,690 --> 00:11:34,470
is literally a thousand times the number
of people you see in that picture.

213
00:11:34,590 --> 00:11:39,180
It is truly a global movement in terms
of teachers deciding they're going to

214
00:11:39,181 --> 00:11:43,140
teach computer science in their classrooms
and they are really excited about it

215
00:11:43,380 --> 00:11:44,161
because for them,

216
00:11:44,161 --> 00:11:48,300
they're coming from what feels like a
stodgy system that doesn't change and

217
00:11:48,301 --> 00:11:50,190
they're modernizing it as well.
Um,

218
00:11:50,490 --> 00:11:53,290
and this movement began with
something called an hour of code,

219
00:11:53,291 --> 00:11:57,250
asking teachers globally to just
teach one hour of computer science.

220
00:11:57,480 --> 00:12:01,630
And that one hour has been enough not to
learn anything other than to learn that

221
00:12:01,631 --> 00:12:03,040
you can teach computer science,

222
00:12:03,041 --> 00:12:08,041
even if you're a fourth grade teacher
or a seventh grade English teacher and

223
00:12:08,081 --> 00:12:08,980
that your students,

224
00:12:09,010 --> 00:12:11,980
even though they come from
an underprivileged background
and are struggling with

225
00:12:11,981 --> 00:12:15,370
reading and writing can actually
learn coding and, and create apps.

226
00:12:15,640 --> 00:12:19,210
And that learning has then sparked the
passion of hundreds of thousands of

227
00:12:19,211 --> 00:12:22,660
teachers, which then caught the
attention of celebrities, CEO's,

228
00:12:22,661 --> 00:12:27,190
governors and presidents of over 13
different countries and is now driving

229
00:12:27,191 --> 00:12:29,470
lasting change globally.
Uh,

230
00:12:29,480 --> 00:12:32,680
and what's great about this is that
this has been a grassroots bottoms up

231
00:12:32,681 --> 00:12:34,420
movement.
I'm sure you've seen her.

232
00:12:34,421 --> 00:12:37,740
I just showed pictures of presidents
talking about the importance of this and

233
00:12:37,741 --> 00:12:40,480
we've had celebrities, tech
leaders, so on, but the,

234
00:12:40,510 --> 00:12:44,320
but the strength of this movement has
really been teachers in the classrooms

235
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:47,320
deciding that this is something
their students need. Um,

236
00:12:47,830 --> 00:12:50,470
this is both help change
perceptions of computer science.

237
00:12:50,471 --> 00:12:54,970
It's also helped drive results as
speaking about the perceptions. Uh,

238
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:55,601
at this point,

239
00:12:55,601 --> 00:12:59,650
90% of parents want their child's
school to teach computer science.

240
00:12:59,651 --> 00:13:02,830
And this came from a Google
sponsored pull that Gallup did.

241
00:13:03,130 --> 00:13:08,110
A 75% of Americans believe computer
science is cool in a way that it wasn't 10

242
00:13:08,111 --> 00:13:10,900
years ago. Uh, so when I went to school,

243
00:13:10,960 --> 00:13:13,330
computer science was the
nerdiest thing you could take.

244
00:13:13,510 --> 00:13:15,910
You can frankly didn't want to tell
anybody that that's what you were spending

245
00:13:15,911 --> 00:13:16,361
your time on,

246
00:13:16,361 --> 00:13:20,530
just cause he'd immediately sink in the
popularity ranks in middle school or

247
00:13:20,531 --> 00:13:24,160
high school. Uh, whereas now it's
actually considered to be cool. In fact,

248
00:13:24,400 --> 00:13:28,930
17 magazine had a cover story about how
the cool girls are the ones that are

249
00:13:28,931 --> 00:13:32,650
learning to code, which is completely
different than when I was going to school.

250
00:13:33,520 --> 00:13:34,091
At this point.

251
00:13:34,091 --> 00:13:37,000
The majority of parents and even the
majority of teachers believe students

252
00:13:37,001 --> 00:13:39,670
should be required to
learn computer science. Uh,

253
00:13:39,850 --> 00:13:43,750
and the majority of Americans rank it
right after reading and writing and math,

254
00:13:44,010 --> 00:13:47,210
uh, among the top four most
important subjects to be learning a.

255
00:13:47,211 --> 00:13:49,990
So everybody at this point believes
that this should be taught.

256
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:52,960
Now in terms of actual change
in the education system,

257
00:13:53,290 --> 00:13:57,100
the impact we've had in four years is,
is really frankly historic.

258
00:13:57,100 --> 00:13:58,210
It has never happened before.

259
00:13:58,211 --> 00:14:02,350
Over 120 of the largest districts in
the country have all embraced computer

260
00:14:02,351 --> 00:14:07,150
science and begun districtwide
citywide rollouts, including New York,

261
00:14:07,151 --> 00:14:11,230
Los Angeles, Chicago, Miami, Las
Vegas, Houston, Broward, San Francisco,

262
00:14:11,231 --> 00:14:15,330
Oakland at it where we live.
Bellevue is also on the list. Uh,

263
00:14:15,340 --> 00:14:16,960
Seattle public schools is not,

264
00:14:16,961 --> 00:14:20,650
although almost every public school
system around Seattle is. Uh,

265
00:14:20,920 --> 00:14:25,670
and we're working on Seattle, uh, and
we'll, I'm sure we'll send, get there. Um,

266
00:14:25,930 --> 00:14:30,590
over 60,000 teachers have attended
workshops to teach computer science. Uh,

267
00:14:30,700 --> 00:14:34,480
this is really important to point out
because when people talk about how are we

268
00:14:34,481 --> 00:14:38,590
going to get our schools to teach computer
science at the impossible way to do

269
00:14:38,591 --> 00:14:42,940
it is to try to get Google engineers
to become full time teachers. Uh,

270
00:14:42,941 --> 00:14:45,550
or frankly any computer
science professional.

271
00:14:45,730 --> 00:14:48,900
Trying to get them to take a pay
cut from a tech, uh, you know,

272
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:52,670
profession and go into schools is hard.
And more importantly,

273
00:14:52,671 --> 00:14:55,340
most Google engineers is probably
wouldn't make great teachers.

274
00:14:55,341 --> 00:14:58,790
It's not easy to teach.
Uh, and then you know, you,

275
00:14:58,791 --> 00:15:03,230
you don't need a Google level engineer
to teach ninth grade computer science.

276
00:15:03,410 --> 00:15:06,320
We don't have surgeons teaching
ninth grade biology either.

277
00:15:06,321 --> 00:15:09,080
We have science teachers doing it. Um, so,

278
00:15:09,320 --> 00:15:13,070
and the things code.org
does our curriculum lowers
the bar for what a teacher

279
00:15:13,071 --> 00:15:16,280
needs to know to teach computer science
and then our training workshops bring

280
00:15:16,281 --> 00:15:19,670
the teachers up to that bar so they
can then be an effective teacher in a

281
00:15:19,671 --> 00:15:23,870
classroom without ever having had a
computer science background in many cases,

282
00:15:23,871 --> 00:15:25,910
not even having a science
or math background.

283
00:15:26,150 --> 00:15:31,150
We have English teachers and social
studies teachers now teaching Ap College

284
00:15:31,700 --> 00:15:34,620
Level Computer Science, uh, which is
frankly a stunning accomplishment, uh,

285
00:15:35,060 --> 00:15:38,810
for the collective group that has
worked on this. Um, at this point,

286
00:15:38,811 --> 00:15:43,730
20% of all students in the country have
begun coding on code.org, which is great.

287
00:15:43,760 --> 00:15:48,740
And 31 states have either changed
policy or begun work towards rolling out

288
00:15:48,741 --> 00:15:52,500
computer science at a statewide level
as part of their curriculum. Uh,

289
00:15:52,580 --> 00:15:57,290
and this isn't just a, a national
change, it's a global change. Uh,

290
00:15:57,500 --> 00:16:00,600
actually this slide is out of date.
We're already at 16 countries. Uh,

291
00:16:00,740 --> 00:16:04,400
16 countries have changed their new
national curriculum and just the last four

292
00:16:04,401 --> 00:16:06,350
years to add computer science.

293
00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:09,950
Most of them have mandated computer
science or computational thinking to be

294
00:16:09,951 --> 00:16:13,320
taught in primary school from
grades k through eight. Uh,

295
00:16:13,580 --> 00:16:16,340
and there's more countries already
lining up to do the same thing.

296
00:16:16,550 --> 00:16:18,220
So this level of change has,

297
00:16:18,230 --> 00:16:21,800
I don't believe ever happened in the
world education system in terms of the

298
00:16:22,010 --> 00:16:24,110
speed of adopting of a new course.

299
00:16:25,430 --> 00:16:29,090
And this is really thanks to America's
teachers more than anything else. Uh,

300
00:16:29,420 --> 00:16:32,340
you know, America doesn't
lead in education. Uh,

301
00:16:32,420 --> 00:16:36,920
most countries don't look
at the u s education as the
sort of like shiny example

302
00:16:36,921 --> 00:16:40,340
of something to follow. Uh,
but we do lead a technology.

303
00:16:40,341 --> 00:16:44,120
This is the country that invented
the personal computer, the Internet,

304
00:16:44,360 --> 00:16:48,290
the smartphones, social media,
web search, a ecommerce,

305
00:16:48,291 --> 00:16:50,090
all of these things were
invented in America.

306
00:16:50,300 --> 00:16:53,840
And so the countries of the world
actually look to us for leadership in this

307
00:16:53,841 --> 00:16:54,920
field of education.

308
00:16:55,180 --> 00:16:58,580
And so what happens in America's
classrooms is actually having much,

309
00:16:58,581 --> 00:17:01,360
much broader change than
just our own country. Um,

310
00:17:01,970 --> 00:17:05,090
the work we're doing@code.org
is not just building a movement.

311
00:17:05,480 --> 00:17:07,310
It's also building a platform.

312
00:17:08,600 --> 00:17:11,740
And by platform I mean like
a coding online platform. Uh,

313
00:17:11,870 --> 00:17:16,190
so co co.org has now become one of
the fastest spreading online learning

314
00:17:16,191 --> 00:17:20,730
platforms. Uh, we have roughly 10 or
20,000 students joining every day.

315
00:17:21,170 --> 00:17:24,980
We have between 10 or 20,000
teachers joining every month. Uh,

316
00:17:25,310 --> 00:17:28,940
my personal sort of favorite sort of role
model in the world of online learning

317
00:17:28,941 --> 00:17:33,941
is Khan Academy comparing ourselves
to Khan Academy at four years old.

318
00:17:34,280 --> 00:17:37,850
We're twice the size Khan Academy
was when they were six years old. Uh,

319
00:17:37,880 --> 00:17:41,090
which is a great measure and we're
not competitive with Khan Academy.

320
00:17:41,320 --> 00:17:42,880
We teach a very different things.
Uh,

321
00:17:43,050 --> 00:17:45,980
but as a measure of something that's
basically worked its way into classrooms,

322
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:48,470
we're doing fantastically well.
Uh,

323
00:17:48,590 --> 00:17:53,590
and the reason is the stuff
we do is designed to enable
students and teachers to

324
00:17:54,151 --> 00:17:58,020
start coding and creating
immediately without prior experience,

325
00:17:58,260 --> 00:18:00,330
without needing to install eclipse.

326
00:18:00,331 --> 00:18:04,830
Or some other thing on your computer
and on any modern browser without even

327
00:18:04,831 --> 00:18:08,970
needing to know how to type
or even knowing how to read
and write so we can meet

328
00:18:08,971 --> 00:18:10,650
students at any level of experience.

329
00:18:10,920 --> 00:18:14,870
Even a preschool or kindergarten
students can start coding. Um,

330
00:18:15,450 --> 00:18:18,300
and all of this, the work that we've
done is free and it's open source.

331
00:18:18,540 --> 00:18:22,020
And as a result of that has become the
number one platform and curriculum for

332
00:18:22,021 --> 00:18:26,030
teaching computer science in k
through 12 all around the world. Uh,

333
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:29,100
I want to do some quick demos to
give you a sense of the technology,

334
00:18:29,370 --> 00:18:31,050
but I want to see a quick show of hands.

335
00:18:31,051 --> 00:18:34,770
How many people here have seen
coding on code.org before?

336
00:18:35,660 --> 00:18:39,090
All right,
so I'm going to do two quick demos,

337
00:18:39,091 --> 00:18:41,430
but one of them will be short
because you probably have seen it,

338
00:18:41,431 --> 00:18:43,950
some version of this before.
So the first is our,

339
00:18:44,310 --> 00:18:46,290
one of our hour of code tutorials.

340
00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:49,920
And this just gives you a sense of
why our curriculum is different than

341
00:18:49,921 --> 00:18:53,580
traditional curriculum.
How the way we combine the ide,

342
00:18:53,760 --> 00:18:57,030
where you do the coding with the videos
that teach you about it and the sort of

343
00:18:57,031 --> 00:18:59,280
instruction on what you're supposed to do.
Um,

344
00:18:59,910 --> 00:19:03,180
the first thing is just the fact that
we have star wars as one of the brands

345
00:19:03,181 --> 00:19:05,320
supporting us is pretty cool.
Uh,

346
00:19:05,910 --> 00:19:10,330
the fact that we can have a video that
has an opening sequence like this, uh,

347
00:19:10,680 --> 00:19:11,820
and this audience doesn't work.

348
00:19:14,060 --> 00:19:15,220
MMM.
Um,

349
00:19:16,210 --> 00:19:19,450
so I'm not going to play for the video,
but the video tutorials,

350
00:19:19,451 --> 00:19:23,290
we have basically how people like the
crater of the star wars movie and all the

351
00:19:23,291 --> 00:19:26,470
women who actually played a role in
making the star wars movie teach this

352
00:19:26,471 --> 00:19:30,140
tutorial just to emphasize the
importance of women in computing. Uh,

353
00:19:30,150 --> 00:19:33,070
and then the code you need to write
is to control the little robot.

354
00:19:33,490 --> 00:19:37,750
And you have ray, who's the, the heroine
of the new movie telling you, you know,

355
00:19:37,751 --> 00:19:40,690
you need to write the code to
get this little BB eight guy.

356
00:19:41,320 --> 00:19:42,850
Let me see if I can make this bigger.

357
00:19:44,800 --> 00:19:47,140
So you need to get BBA to
get to that scrap metal.

358
00:19:47,620 --> 00:19:49,000
And this is a very simple problem.

359
00:19:49,001 --> 00:19:51,010
You just need to move them
to steps to the right.

360
00:19:51,610 --> 00:19:55,200
These are the four types of commands he
could do, which was very limited. Uh,

361
00:19:55,240 --> 00:19:58,510
and his code right now is he
can, when he runs, he moves,

362
00:19:58,511 --> 00:20:01,990
right one step and I'm going
to just have him move up,

363
00:20:01,991 --> 00:20:04,390
which is not the right
thing and then move down

364
00:20:06,920 --> 00:20:08,170
and then move right?
Again,

365
00:20:13,210 --> 00:20:16,210
that was not very complicated,
but for if you've never,

366
00:20:16,211 --> 00:20:17,740
ever done any coding before,

367
00:20:18,160 --> 00:20:23,080
that is so much more fun and
easy than install visual studio.

368
00:20:23,081 --> 00:20:24,070
And then,
you know,

369
00:20:24,220 --> 00:20:27,700
figuring out what sub routines you need
to include and like what libraries you

370
00:20:27,701 --> 00:20:30,910
need and then compile and then how do you,
what you need to do.

371
00:20:30,911 --> 00:20:34,840
And then it also shows you, this is the
javascript for the code that you made.

372
00:20:35,290 --> 00:20:36,400
This,
as many of you may know,

373
00:20:36,401 --> 00:20:40,130
is based on the open source blockly
sub routines that uh, uh, the,

374
00:20:40,131 --> 00:20:43,000
the blockly source code that
Google has helped us with.

375
00:20:43,330 --> 00:20:47,260
One thing I was also really exciting when
we launched this tutorial was being to

376
00:20:47,261 --> 00:20:50,590
say that we were using
intellectual property by Disney,

377
00:20:50,860 --> 00:20:54,250
open source code by Google funding,

378
00:20:54,251 --> 00:20:58,980
by Microsoft running on Amazon's web
servers showcase in every apple store. Uh,

379
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:03,250
there's so few things that have this many
otherwise competitors working together

380
00:21:03,251 --> 00:21:06,160
on one problem. Uh, and
this tutorial has been done.

381
00:21:06,550 --> 00:21:09,700
I'm not going to walk through all 15
steps or the different puzzles you walk

382
00:21:09,701 --> 00:21:12,160
through,
but after 15 steps in about 30 minutes,

383
00:21:12,161 --> 00:21:16,330
you can make your own game featuring
r two d two getting chased by storm

384
00:21:16,331 --> 00:21:18,280
troopers are running
after the storm troopers.

385
00:21:18,281 --> 00:21:22,210
You can write your own rules and then
play it on your phone. Um, and these,

386
00:21:22,211 --> 00:21:24,860
these one hour tutorials are super fun.
Uh,

387
00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:28,270
but we've built a complete ide for
building much more complicated things.

388
00:21:28,271 --> 00:21:32,160
And I want to give you an example
of how that works outside of, uh,

389
00:21:32,230 --> 00:21:36,740
sort of curriculum. So this here is
our ID. That's called APP lab. Uh,

390
00:21:36,741 --> 00:21:37,421
it's over here.

391
00:21:37,421 --> 00:21:41,180
You can create an APP and I'm going to
show you really quickly how it works. Um,

392
00:21:41,590 --> 00:21:43,630
so I'm gonna make my app,

393
00:21:44,050 --> 00:21:46,300
I'm first going to put a
background color on the screen.

394
00:21:47,770 --> 00:21:50,530
So she was like a blue color.
And then

395
00:21:52,120 --> 00:21:57,010
can I put a label here
that says my drawing APP?

396
00:22:00,790 --> 00:22:01,623
Okay,

397
00:22:04,330 --> 00:22:09,080
can y'all see that? And then I'm
going to put a piece of texts,

398
00:22:09,430 --> 00:22:14,000
a text box here saying to, to ask
somebody, what should we draw?

399
00:22:14,360 --> 00:22:19,360
I'm going to say enter a number of
sides and I'll put a button to draw.

400
00:22:21,930 --> 00:22:24,920
I'm kind of rushing through this.
It doesn't look very good, but okay,

401
00:22:24,921 --> 00:22:28,100
so we have a little app that if I click
the draw button, it'll draw a shape.

402
00:22:28,430 --> 00:22:32,390
And so I need to attach some code
to this so I can go into code mode.

403
00:22:32,391 --> 00:22:35,300
And then I can say on
event when I get an event,

404
00:22:35,510 --> 00:22:38,120
and any of you are familiar
with the document object model,

405
00:22:38,121 --> 00:22:40,760
know that this isn't the
full document object model.

406
00:22:40,761 --> 00:22:44,570
There's no such thing as an on event call.
Uh, but you know, I can say, you know,

407
00:22:44,571 --> 00:22:47,810
when the button is clicked,
I can start writing some code.

408
00:22:48,170 --> 00:22:51,890
And so I need to figure out how
many sides my shape needs to be.

409
00:22:52,250 --> 00:22:56,660
So I'm going to set a variable to that
sort of x will be the variable that keeps

410
00:22:56,661 --> 00:22:59,570
that uh, an x. We'll
get the number of sides.

411
00:22:59,930 --> 00:23:02,810
So I need to get the text from this thing.

412
00:23:02,811 --> 00:23:06,320
So at the text for that is the
text that's in text input one.

413
00:23:06,321 --> 00:23:09,100
So now we want to draw an x sided shape,
uh,

414
00:23:09,170 --> 00:23:12,530
for that I'm going to need a for loop.
So here's a four loop.

415
00:23:12,950 --> 00:23:15,890
And so as I'm doing this, you probably
recognize what this looks like.

416
00:23:15,891 --> 00:23:20,570
Even though these are blocks, you can
actually switch and see this in text mode.

417
00:23:21,140 --> 00:23:24,570
And this is basically you're typing
in Java script seminar account.

418
00:23:25,580 --> 00:23:28,010
I goes from zero and it should go up to x.

419
00:23:29,320 --> 00:23:34,010
And so x times I want to draw a line at
and we have turtle drawing commands to

420
00:23:34,011 --> 00:23:34,671
make this easy.

421
00:23:34,671 --> 00:23:38,720
So I can say move forward and I can drag
blocks interior even if I don't want to

422
00:23:38,721 --> 00:23:39,980
type.
So I'll move forward,

423
00:23:40,460 --> 00:23:44,030
let's say 50 pixels and
then I'll turn right.

424
00:23:45,610 --> 00:23:50,500
And this will need to be 360 divided
by x degrees to get to x sided shape.

425
00:23:50,980 --> 00:23:52,420
And so this is a very simple app.

426
00:23:52,480 --> 00:23:56,140
I can now run my app and say
I want a five sided shape.

427
00:23:56,880 --> 00:23:57,500
Yeah,

428
00:23:57,500 --> 00:24:02,120
it should draw a Pentagon. So not super
amazing, but it was relatively fast.

429
00:24:02,121 --> 00:24:03,440
I don't need to create an account,

430
00:24:03,441 --> 00:24:07,910
I don't need to install anything and I
can share this and I can send it to my

431
00:24:07,911 --> 00:24:08,744
phone.

432
00:24:10,080 --> 00:24:15,080
This is probably the best part about this
for students and the speed at which we

433
00:24:15,571 --> 00:24:18,840
can let you create something
and then get it on your phone

434
00:24:20,830 --> 00:24:23,450
is what really makes this
magical for students. So this is,

435
00:24:23,750 --> 00:24:27,260
I basically set myself a text message
and you probably can't see my phone,

436
00:24:27,950 --> 00:24:30,080
but just from the color you
might be able to recognize it.

437
00:24:30,081 --> 00:24:34,010
It's the same thing with the little text
box in Soma and basically does exactly

438
00:24:34,011 --> 00:24:37,610
that on your phone, uh,
for prototyping in school.

439
00:24:37,910 --> 00:24:42,090
The other solutions for doing something
like this takes so much effort at and

440
00:24:42,110 --> 00:24:46,370
this base, he shows by making coding
easy, accessible, web based free.

441
00:24:46,670 --> 00:24:50,060
We've made it much, much easier for
students and teachers to engage with us.

442
00:24:50,320 --> 00:24:52,940
And this is just like five minutes
of showing what this looks like.

443
00:24:53,150 --> 00:24:58,150
We've made literally 400 hours worth of
exercise and activities starting from

444
00:24:58,191 --> 00:25:02,240
kindergarten all the way through a high
school AP computer science to make this

445
00:25:02,241 --> 00:25:03,074
stuff easier.

446
00:25:03,410 --> 00:25:07,160
The reason code.org has become so big
is because we've lowered the bar so much

447
00:25:07,161 --> 00:25:11,060
for schools to engage in computer
science. Um, we act very small.

448
00:25:11,061 --> 00:25:14,480
We're a 60 person startup and
our DNA is like a tech company.

449
00:25:14,660 --> 00:25:17,350
So we act small but we think really big.
Um,

450
00:25:17,810 --> 00:25:22,810
and as a result of this shows that the
growth of AP computer science in schools,

451
00:25:22,971 --> 00:25:24,500
which is the college board exam,

452
00:25:24,710 --> 00:25:28,340
which is basically the pinnacle of the
computer science sort of a learning

453
00:25:28,341 --> 00:25:29,174
pathway.

454
00:25:29,300 --> 00:25:33,380
This current school year that just ended
was our first time teaching AP computer

455
00:25:33,381 --> 00:25:34,980
science in schools.
Uh,

456
00:25:35,120 --> 00:25:38,690
and that's basically what AP computer
science looks like after the first year of

457
00:25:38,691 --> 00:25:42,860
code.org teaching the course. Uh, and
since we care a lot about diversity,

458
00:25:43,130 --> 00:25:46,880
this is what the picture looks like
for women in computer science and for

459
00:25:46,881 --> 00:25:50,090
underrepresented minorities in
computer science. In both cases,

460
00:25:50,091 --> 00:25:54,980
we more than doubled participation in the
AP program in just our very first year

461
00:25:54,981 --> 00:25:56,750
of teaching it next year.

462
00:25:56,750 --> 00:26:00,570
I expect we will more than double it
relative to where we were last year. Uh,

463
00:26:00,830 --> 00:26:01,820
yet again,
uh,

464
00:26:02,060 --> 00:26:05,390
just because our growth this coming
year is more than double our growth from

465
00:26:05,391 --> 00:26:07,520
last year. Uh, so the,

466
00:26:07,521 --> 00:26:10,880
the impact we're having in terms of
the entire computer science pathways,

467
00:26:10,881 --> 00:26:14,120
not only getting students
into try and computer science,

468
00:26:14,121 --> 00:26:18,470
but getting all the way to
teaching basically college
level computer science to

469
00:26:18,471 --> 00:26:20,160
kids in public schools.
Uh,

470
00:26:20,540 --> 00:26:24,210
and I want to say something about
diversity because you know, when,

471
00:26:24,211 --> 00:26:27,500
when I look around this room and when
you look anywhere in the tech world,

472
00:26:27,530 --> 00:26:28,820
diversity is a problem.

473
00:26:29,030 --> 00:26:32,870
And that problem is partly because of
the cultural issues in the workplace,

474
00:26:32,871 --> 00:26:34,100
issues that we all hear about.

475
00:26:34,370 --> 00:26:39,320
But a huge part of it is also what
happens in the education pipeline that our

476
00:26:39,321 --> 00:26:43,260
education system has almost the exact
same diversity challenges in computer

477
00:26:43,261 --> 00:26:44,040
science.

478
00:26:44,040 --> 00:26:49,040
Traditionally computer science has been
a 80% male dominated and more than 80%

479
00:26:50,010 --> 00:26:55,010
non basically white Asian or Indian
dominated field in k through 12 as well as

480
00:26:56,581 --> 00:26:58,320
in university as well as in the workplace.

481
00:26:58,650 --> 00:27:01,530
The work code.org has been
doing is in every school,

482
00:27:01,770 --> 00:27:04,770
particularly with a focus
on urban and rural schools,

483
00:27:04,950 --> 00:27:08,160
which have the most underprivileged kids.
And as a result of that,

484
00:27:08,161 --> 00:27:10,570
our students are very different from,
uh,

485
00:27:10,740 --> 00:27:15,540
from what you see in the traditional
workforce. So, uh, in our classrooms,

486
00:27:15,870 --> 00:27:18,120
the classrooms are 45% female.

487
00:27:18,240 --> 00:27:20,910
They're almost 50%
underrepresented minorities.

488
00:27:21,150 --> 00:27:24,570
And something that people don't talk very
much is how many of them are poor kids.

489
00:27:24,571 --> 00:27:28,500
47% of them are kids who can't even afford
lunch and they're learning coding and

490
00:27:28,501 --> 00:27:32,670
computer science. Uh, and if you
look at our kids taking the AP exam,

491
00:27:32,680 --> 00:27:34,260
even passing the AP exam,

492
00:27:34,470 --> 00:27:38,160
there's similar numbers that are female
percentage on the AP exam is lower.

493
00:27:38,400 --> 00:27:43,400
But our percentage of minorities and
basically a less affluent kids taking AP

494
00:27:43,921 --> 00:27:47,730
computer science is matching the,
the entire country's diversity.

495
00:27:47,910 --> 00:27:51,630
This is a fantastic story for
opportunity and diversity.

496
00:27:51,631 --> 00:27:55,650
It'll change what our workplaces look
like in the tech industry and it's really

497
00:27:55,651 --> 00:27:59,010
giving a pathway to these kids who
otherwise wouldn't have won. Uh,

498
00:27:59,310 --> 00:28:03,510
studies show that women are 10 times
more likely to take a computer science if

499
00:28:03,511 --> 00:28:04,800
they studied in high school.

500
00:28:04,980 --> 00:28:09,330
Black and Hispanic kids are eight times
more likely to study it in university if

501
00:28:09,331 --> 00:28:11,790
they take it in high
school. And in fact, uh,

502
00:28:12,150 --> 00:28:15,660
black and Hispanic students are more
interested in learning computer science

503
00:28:15,661 --> 00:28:19,590
then white students are, they're just
less likely to have it in their schools.

504
00:28:19,770 --> 00:28:20,461
And as a result,

505
00:28:20,461 --> 00:28:23,430
they never tried in high school and then
they never go into it to university,

506
00:28:23,730 --> 00:28:28,620
which is why the k through 12 system is
where to make this change. Um, in general,

507
00:28:28,621 --> 00:28:32,820
I believe the American dream is really
a global ideal for opportunity for all.

508
00:28:33,050 --> 00:28:35,670
And every one of us is here
where we are because we caught a

509
00:28:35,671 --> 00:28:40,671
break@somepointinourlivesandtheworkofcode.org
is
basically
helping
bring
that

510
00:28:41,551 --> 00:28:44,670
level of opportunity to the kids who
need it the most in America at schools.

511
00:28:45,570 --> 00:28:46,380
I think that's it.

512
00:28:46,380 --> 00:28:49,980
But I lastly wanted to close by thanking
the very generous donors who support

513
00:28:49,981 --> 00:28:53,800
our work. Uh, you know, we, we wouldn't
be anywhere. We are without the,

514
00:28:53,820 --> 00:28:56,790
the various corporations and
individuals who support us.

515
00:28:56,791 --> 00:28:59,350
Google is one of our largest supporters.
Uh,

516
00:28:59,370 --> 00:29:03,030
and we've been very lucky to have Google
support since the very beginning. Uh, so,

517
00:29:03,530 --> 00:29:07,890
uh, thank you very much for your part of
your work is helping feed co.org through

518
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:12,120
the generous work that you
do. Um, thank you very much.

519
00:29:12,350 --> 00:29:12,610
Uh,

520
00:29:12,610 --> 00:29:17,610
please [inaudible].

521
00:29:18,890 --> 00:29:22,550
Uh, I would like to ask [inaudible]
to join us for the panel discussion.

522
00:29:22,551 --> 00:29:23,110
Thank you,
honey.

523
00:29:23,110 --> 00:29:26,530
All right. Um, I want to thank Heidi. Um,

524
00:29:26,570 --> 00:29:30,840
I think that is just one of
the most inspirational, uh, uh,

525
00:29:31,390 --> 00:29:34,040
you know, real life
stories. It's, it's amazing.

526
00:29:34,041 --> 00:29:38,810
I have the privilege of having worked
for Heidi, uh, over a decade ago. And,

527
00:29:38,811 --> 00:29:39,590
uh,

528
00:29:39,590 --> 00:29:44,590
I was there when he started this and
I am absolutely amazed at what he has

529
00:29:45,611 --> 00:29:49,480
accomplished and the level of depth and
passion that you guys can see in how

530
00:29:49,481 --> 00:29:51,310
he's speaking about the subject.
It's,

531
00:29:51,520 --> 00:29:55,330
it's really amazing to have a global
impact in such a short amount of time.

532
00:29:55,630 --> 00:29:59,890
So thank you, Heidi.
Thank you. Um, so, uh,

533
00:30:00,040 --> 00:30:04,150
first I'd like to start with, you
know, why did you start code.org?

534
00:30:04,760 --> 00:30:05,593
Okay,

535
00:30:05,670 --> 00:30:08,630
so this is actually an interesting
thing, which I would say, um,

536
00:30:08,700 --> 00:30:12,360
I didn't start code.org thinking I want
to change the world's education system,

537
00:30:12,830 --> 00:30:16,220
which would be a very
arrogant thing to think. Uh,

538
00:30:16,221 --> 00:30:17,940
I just wanted to make a video.

539
00:30:18,040 --> 00:30:21,480
It's to say that computer science is
important and I was at the time kind of

540
00:30:21,481 --> 00:30:24,450
unemployed and not really doing
anything of value and just thought,

541
00:30:24,510 --> 00:30:28,770
what can I do that's useful with my time?
Uh, I didn't make sort of a home movie.

542
00:30:28,771 --> 00:30:33,510
I kind of used all of my best connections
from two decades of working in the

543
00:30:33,511 --> 00:30:34,344
tech industry.

544
00:30:34,560 --> 00:30:37,860
So I managed to get Bill Gates and
Mark Zuckerberg and Jack Dorsey to

545
00:30:37,861 --> 00:30:41,120
participate in this video.
So it was a pretty big affair,

546
00:30:41,130 --> 00:30:45,630
but it was just one video and I had no
plans for what would be coming beyond the

547
00:30:45,631 --> 00:30:45,871
video.

548
00:30:45,871 --> 00:30:48,870
I thought I'd put out this great video
that computer science is important in

549
00:30:48,871 --> 00:30:52,950
schools should teach it.
Uh, the video went viral,

550
00:30:53,040 --> 00:30:55,140
not only to get 10 million views,
more importantly,

551
00:30:55,141 --> 00:30:58,500
20,000 schools reached out and said,
we want this.

552
00:30:58,710 --> 00:31:02,340
And that's what made me realize if
20,000 schools respond to one video,

553
00:31:02,520 --> 00:31:06,700
there's just a real interest
in this. Um, but the, uh,

554
00:31:07,050 --> 00:31:08,470
the personal reason I got into it,

555
00:31:08,471 --> 00:31:11,390
it's just because of my life
story of success in tech. Uh,

556
00:31:11,430 --> 00:31:14,340
but what I love telling people
about this is really, you know,

557
00:31:14,550 --> 00:31:19,200
this did not start as a big plan or
this flash of genius or anything.

558
00:31:19,410 --> 00:31:23,010
Uh,
and considering that in four years,

559
00:31:23,100 --> 00:31:27,450
so much of the world education system
has changed starting from this one little

560
00:31:27,451 --> 00:31:28,260
video.

561
00:31:28,260 --> 00:31:32,780
Anybody for me has really drilled home
this idea that if you have a big dream,

562
00:31:32,950 --> 00:31:36,780
if you work hard at it, I'm an
aim big, anything is possible.

563
00:31:36,870 --> 00:31:39,380
I think many people's ambitions,
uh,

564
00:31:39,750 --> 00:31:42,990
are held back by their fear
of trying for something.

565
00:31:43,260 --> 00:31:45,150
And sometimes if you aim extra high,

566
00:31:45,151 --> 00:31:48,090
you actually have a greater chance of
succeeding because more people want to

567
00:31:48,091 --> 00:31:48,924
support you.

568
00:31:49,990 --> 00:31:54,370
Thank you. Heidi. Phil, I know you
were also involved in the early days.

569
00:31:54,670 --> 00:31:56,020
We'd love to hear your story.

570
00:31:56,940 --> 00:31:59,550
I'd like to tell a little bit, um, um,

571
00:31:59,640 --> 00:32:04,640
because I hope that you all will will
also join me in comport computed,

572
00:32:06,610 --> 00:32:09,370
uh,
supporting cs education and uh,

573
00:32:09,480 --> 00:32:13,500
this is a potential area of growth
for the Kirkland campus. So, uh,

574
00:32:13,530 --> 00:32:14,880
I too had worked with Hadi.

575
00:32:15,750 --> 00:32:19,350
I have always been super impressed
by the way he approaches things,

576
00:32:19,351 --> 00:32:24,330
including the way he approached a CS
education, which is, it's a nonprofit,

577
00:32:24,331 --> 00:32:28,500
but it really does work like a startup.
And, um, he's been incredibly driven.

578
00:32:28,860 --> 00:32:29,720
So,
um,

579
00:32:29,940 --> 00:32:34,940
initially my involvement was helping him
launch the website around the video and

580
00:32:35,491 --> 00:32:39,980
start to establish connections
with people. Um, and, um,

581
00:32:40,190 --> 00:32:44,990
that was just really incredibly rewarding
to be able to help out a little bit

582
00:32:44,991 --> 00:32:49,850
for this. Um, I, I also felt a
strong need to want to give back.

583
00:32:49,851 --> 00:32:50,310
I mean we,

584
00:32:50,310 --> 00:32:55,190
we've all been really lucky and for this
country to continue to be successful or

585
00:32:55,191 --> 00:32:57,170
for Google to continue to be successful,

586
00:32:57,380 --> 00:33:01,190
we need everybody to have
opportunities and do well. Um,

587
00:33:01,430 --> 00:33:02,540
beyond that,

588
00:33:02,630 --> 00:33:07,630
I had the great fortune to work with
code.org for a year helping them scale for

589
00:33:08,811 --> 00:33:09,590
hour of code.

590
00:33:09,590 --> 00:33:13,760
They'd been tremendously successful as
such that they're scaling pressure on the

591
00:33:13,761 --> 00:33:18,680
website. So I helped them
with some technical and team
improvements to the site.

592
00:33:19,090 --> 00:33:22,640
And this is an example
of how Google is really,

593
00:33:22,641 --> 00:33:27,380
really far sighted about this. They
gave one of their engineers to, to help,

594
00:33:27,410 --> 00:33:32,090
um, a nonprofit that they
support it, um, to, to succeed,

595
00:33:32,780 --> 00:33:36,890
not for short term profit concerns
because they knew this was about making

596
00:33:36,891 --> 00:33:41,690
Google successful for the long term and
about making society successful. Um,

597
00:33:42,230 --> 00:33:47,210
beyond that, starting in
September, I'm joining edge edu.

598
00:33:47,540 --> 00:33:51,950
This is the organization within Google
that supports both internal, uh,

599
00:33:51,980 --> 00:33:52,910
CS education,

600
00:33:52,911 --> 00:33:55,970
which you've probably seen in some of
the classes if you've taken the machine

601
00:33:55,971 --> 00:33:58,940
learning bootcamp or something like that.
They do that,

602
00:33:58,941 --> 00:34:03,320
but they also support external
education. Uh, that includes the,

603
00:34:03,500 --> 00:34:06,300
the blockly framework
that code.org uses a,

604
00:34:06,330 --> 00:34:09,540
that includes some of the funding efforts,
um,

605
00:34:09,770 --> 00:34:14,000
as well as platforms that Google is
building to help promote CS education in

606
00:34:14,001 --> 00:34:18,620
general. Um, so I, uh,
there are already several,

607
00:34:18,621 --> 00:34:23,150
um, program managers and non engineers
and Kirkland working on this.

608
00:34:23,210 --> 00:34:28,070
Um, I will be the first engineer. We
do have an open head count. So if,

609
00:34:28,130 --> 00:34:32,420
if cs education is something you're
excited about, a police talk with me.

610
00:34:33,380 --> 00:34:36,160
All right, well thank you. Fell. Um, hi.

611
00:34:36,200 --> 00:34:39,090
I know you've made a pretty
convincing case about this already,

612
00:34:39,120 --> 00:34:43,920
but I'd love to hear from you why you
think all students need to learn to code.

613
00:34:44,610 --> 00:34:47,000
So this is a question we get all the time.
Um,

614
00:34:47,520 --> 00:34:51,540
usually with a more critical
version of delivery,

615
00:34:52,350 --> 00:34:55,140
people regularly say,
you know, why are we,

616
00:34:55,141 --> 00:34:57,750
why should we teach third graders
how to code? Or, you know,

617
00:34:58,020 --> 00:34:59,790
not every kid is going to become a coder.

618
00:34:59,880 --> 00:35:03,150
And this is something that
is often viewed as, you know,

619
00:35:03,570 --> 00:35:07,160
code.org is trying to get people into
tech jobs or something like that. Uh,

620
00:35:07,260 --> 00:35:09,780
and I usually say we're not trying
to get every kid to learn to code.

621
00:35:09,781 --> 00:35:12,450
We're trying to get every school
to teach computer science,

622
00:35:12,451 --> 00:35:16,320
which is very different. Uh, computer
science is much more broad than coding.

623
00:35:16,620 --> 00:35:20,730
W The only reason we're called code.org
is because we wanted the shortest URL

624
00:35:20,731 --> 00:35:25,440
possible. Otherwise we would have been
schools to teach computer science.org.

625
00:35:25,770 --> 00:35:27,280
Uh, but, uh,

626
00:35:27,660 --> 00:35:31,710
computer science includes things like
learning how does the Internet work or how

627
00:35:31,711 --> 00:35:36,711
to keep your computer safe on the
internet or big data and data analysis.

628
00:35:37,350 --> 00:35:40,440
And when you think about that, those
types of things, how networks work,

629
00:35:40,860 --> 00:35:43,320
these are much broader
than just learning to code.

630
00:35:43,770 --> 00:35:45,960
And every school should
offer them, uh, you know,

631
00:35:46,080 --> 00:35:50,490
just data analysis type of thing that
almost every 21st century jobs at a need,

632
00:35:50,491 --> 00:35:53,400
some version of that staying
safe on the Internet, every,

633
00:35:53,401 --> 00:35:54,810
every child can benefit from.

634
00:35:55,110 --> 00:35:57,750
And as soon as you realize the
broader view of computer science,

635
00:35:57,990 --> 00:36:01,400
the idea of having schools that don't
teach it suddenly seems really short.

636
00:36:01,580 --> 00:36:02,413
Shortsighted.

637
00:36:04,270 --> 00:36:08,470
Who Do you feel like teaching
computer science? Um,

638
00:36:08,500 --> 00:36:11,290
when our teachers are
struggling to teach the basics.

639
00:36:11,530 --> 00:36:12,820
How do you think that we can,

640
00:36:12,880 --> 00:36:16,960
I know you have amazing statistics in
terms of the teachers that have joined the

641
00:36:16,961 --> 00:36:20,530
force in terms of teaching computer
science, but you know, as you know, it's,

642
00:36:20,590 --> 00:36:22,390
it's easier to grow small numbers.

643
00:36:22,391 --> 00:36:24,790
What do you think it takes
to bring it to the masses?

644
00:36:25,140 --> 00:36:28,450
I'm one the teachers are struggling with
a lot of the basics in our education

645
00:36:28,451 --> 00:36:30,110
system. Yup. Yup.

646
00:36:31,450 --> 00:36:36,260
Our education system is not great.
I should start by saying, um,

647
00:36:36,370 --> 00:36:40,960
nobody looks at the US education system
no matter who you are and thinks this is

648
00:36:40,961 --> 00:36:43,060
just amazing.
Every country should do it this way.

649
00:36:43,270 --> 00:36:46,120
Most of the teachers and the education
system don't feel that way either.

650
00:36:46,121 --> 00:36:51,121
It's a system that just feels kind of
left behind or improperly tended or so on,

651
00:36:51,820 --> 00:36:56,440
schools or short on budgets. There's
just all sorts of issues in our country.

652
00:36:56,890 --> 00:37:00,580
Make teaching also harder as well because
kids come to school with all sorts of

653
00:37:00,880 --> 00:37:02,650
home issues that they bring and so on.

654
00:37:03,250 --> 00:37:07,060
So our schools are struggling and our
teachers are struggling there frankly on

655
00:37:07,061 --> 00:37:10,360
the front lines of trying to help
a lot of kids get to a better path.

656
00:37:10,720 --> 00:37:11,830
People regularly asked me,

657
00:37:11,831 --> 00:37:15,190
can these kids who are struggling to
learn reading and writing and the teachers

658
00:37:15,191 --> 00:37:19,390
who were not able to get them to
pass basic graduation requirements,

659
00:37:19,570 --> 00:37:21,490
can they learn computer science?
Uh,

660
00:37:22,180 --> 00:37:26,290
and I actually be believed that teaching
computer science in the schools can

661
00:37:26,291 --> 00:37:30,130
actually help rather than make it
harder because it can make school more

662
00:37:30,131 --> 00:37:31,450
engaging and more relevant.

663
00:37:31,470 --> 00:37:34,950
And I made this point earlier
about making school more fun. Uh,

664
00:37:35,050 --> 00:37:38,620
it's not something that
the adults necessarily know
cause they didn't themselves

665
00:37:38,621 --> 00:37:40,870
study computer science so they
don't even know what it's about.

666
00:37:41,320 --> 00:37:45,130
But once they try it in the classroom
and they see how engaged the kids are,

667
00:37:45,430 --> 00:37:47,560
it actually makes a difference
for the rest of school.

668
00:37:47,561 --> 00:37:51,610
And we've had so many stories about this
that a wonderful, just a few weeks ago,

669
00:37:51,611 --> 00:37:53,710
one of our, not not
weeks, a few months ago,

670
00:37:54,010 --> 00:37:58,120
one of our teachers wrote in about a
student that had stopped coming to school

671
00:37:58,121 --> 00:38:01,390
in ninth grade and four
47 school days straight.

672
00:38:01,391 --> 00:38:02,650
This student just stopped coming.

673
00:38:03,020 --> 00:38:07,120
Imagine a ninth grader who just for
two months no longer comes to school.

674
00:38:07,120 --> 00:38:10,510
That kid, if that, if that
continues, their life is on a very,

675
00:38:10,511 --> 00:38:13,220
very different path than,
than anybody here. Um,

676
00:38:13,330 --> 00:38:15,250
and then the teacher
wrote into the dad saying,

677
00:38:15,251 --> 00:38:19,300
we're about to start this new computer
science pilot with code.org could you

678
00:38:19,301 --> 00:38:21,940
have your kid come and try that?
Maybe. Maybe they'll like it.

679
00:38:22,240 --> 00:38:23,500
And not only the kid liked it,

680
00:38:23,501 --> 00:38:27,700
the kid has now stayed in school and
he literally credits the fact that he's

681
00:38:27,701 --> 00:38:30,340
learning coding for the reason he
was coming at school. That's a,

682
00:38:30,350 --> 00:38:34,810
that's an extreme example of a kid who
otherwise would basically be lost in our

683
00:38:34,990 --> 00:38:37,960
society to now they're, you know,
they're back in school again.

684
00:38:38,200 --> 00:38:43,200
But that that small dynamic is a microcosm
of what lots of students feel because

685
00:38:43,601 --> 00:38:45,430
computer science is more relevant to them.

686
00:38:45,431 --> 00:38:49,720
Then trigonometry or Middle
Eastern history or you know,

687
00:38:49,930 --> 00:38:52,090
learning languages and countries,
they'll never visit her.

688
00:38:52,091 --> 00:38:55,570
A lot of the other things that we have
to memorize in school just to pass tests.

689
00:38:56,920 --> 00:38:59,950
So how do you feel we can
help our teachers? You know,

690
00:38:59,960 --> 00:39:04,320
it feels like they're really critical
to do the vision behind code.org.

691
00:39:04,321 --> 00:39:06,700
As you said,
it's a teacher led movement.

692
00:39:07,060 --> 00:39:09,220
How do you think we can
actually help our teachers?

693
00:39:10,180 --> 00:39:15,180
We do a lot of things to help teachers
are our main customer@code.org as

694
00:39:15,221 --> 00:39:16,390
teachers,
you know,

695
00:39:16,391 --> 00:39:19,480
for any tech startup it's important
to know who is your customer.

696
00:39:20,620 --> 00:39:24,490
And for us it could be the the students
or the parents or the policy makers or

697
00:39:24,491 --> 00:39:28,000
whatnot. But teachers are our
most important customer. Uh,

698
00:39:28,060 --> 00:39:31,990
everything we do is focused on how to
make teachers more successful and more

699
00:39:31,991 --> 00:39:36,860
appreciated. And appreciation is
actually a really important thing. Um,

700
00:39:37,090 --> 00:39:40,000
teachers generally feel underpaid,

701
00:39:40,001 --> 00:39:42,530
disrespected and unappreciated in America.
Uh,

702
00:39:43,090 --> 00:39:45,730
part of why code.org has been
successful is because we are,

703
00:39:45,880 --> 00:39:49,720
we continuously lavish our teachers
with praise for the work that they do.

704
00:39:49,721 --> 00:39:53,520
And they noticed that because nobody
else lavish them with praise. Uh,

705
00:39:53,740 --> 00:39:57,250
but then we also help them with all
sorts of little things. Um, you know,

706
00:39:57,251 --> 00:39:57,791
for example,

707
00:39:57,791 --> 00:40:01,390
the fact that you don't need to create
an account to do the hour of code makes

708
00:40:01,391 --> 00:40:04,870
it just one step easier. Um, we
even do things like, you know,

709
00:40:04,871 --> 00:40:09,070
we have a lot of unplugged activities
that don't require a computer. Uh,

710
00:40:09,100 --> 00:40:13,750
but they require stuff. For example,
we, we teach kids how to do sorting,

711
00:40:13,950 --> 00:40:18,310
uh, you know, sorting algorithms by giving
kids a deck of cards and then, you know,

712
00:40:18,311 --> 00:40:20,230
telling them to get together
in a group and put the,

713
00:40:20,350 --> 00:40:23,530
put the deck in order and then
come back and say how you did it.

714
00:40:23,750 --> 00:40:25,150
And it's a nice way of learning,

715
00:40:25,240 --> 00:40:27,700
just trying a sorting algorithm
and then explaining what you did.

716
00:40:27,910 --> 00:40:30,160
You're kind of putting your
mind into algorithmic thinking.

717
00:40:30,550 --> 00:40:33,910
But one of the ways we help our teachers
is we shipped the ducks have cards to

718
00:40:33,911 --> 00:40:37,570
them so they don't need to go to the
store and basically by the deck of cards

719
00:40:37,571 --> 00:40:41,200
from their own salaries.
So teachers who teach our courses,

720
00:40:41,680 --> 00:40:45,740
they could get basically like a box of
the deck of multiple decks of cards,

721
00:40:45,741 --> 00:40:46,660
some paper cups,

722
00:40:46,661 --> 00:40:50,200
like a bunch of little stuff they need
to get like all the shopping they would

723
00:40:50,201 --> 00:40:51,160
otherwise need to do.

724
00:40:51,550 --> 00:40:56,550
They literally get it from code.org in
fact where we ship $500,000 a year of

725
00:40:58,720 --> 00:41:03,720
stuff like that to classrooms basically
just to save the teachers the hassle

726
00:41:03,851 --> 00:41:07,210
because if they had to buy the decks of
cards themselves, many of them wouldn't.

727
00:41:07,211 --> 00:41:10,300
And they wouldn't teach that that exercise
cause they just don't have the time

728
00:41:10,301 --> 00:41:13,120
or money to do it.
The little things really matter.

729
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:17,350
Yeah. That's amazing. It's everything
that you guys have done. It's,

730
00:41:17,360 --> 00:41:21,470
it seems like you paid attention to a
water of the little details that add a lot

731
00:41:21,471 --> 00:41:26,180
of convenience. Um, so I'm curious
if we add computer science,

732
00:41:26,240 --> 00:41:28,310
what should it replace in the curriculum?

733
00:41:30,440 --> 00:41:34,160
Yeah,
this is a about controversial question.

734
00:41:34,290 --> 00:41:38,210
I might give my mom global
answer just in this room.

735
00:41:38,600 --> 00:41:42,260
I'll first tell you the diplomatic
answer. Um, because there's actually,

736
00:41:42,261 --> 00:41:46,820
you can add computer science without
replacing a ton. In most cases.

737
00:41:46,821 --> 00:41:48,110
In elementary school,

738
00:41:48,350 --> 00:41:52,810
you don't really need to replace
anything because it's so much fun. Uh,

739
00:41:52,880 --> 00:41:55,130
if you imagine like the
second grade classroom,

740
00:41:55,131 --> 00:42:00,110
if any of you have kids in second grade,
kids aren't learning every hour. Math,

741
00:42:00,111 --> 00:42:02,510
science, English, history, you know,

742
00:42:02,570 --> 00:42:07,570
you have to interrupt their class time
with play time just to keep them engaged.

743
00:42:07,670 --> 00:42:07,821
You know,

744
00:42:07,821 --> 00:42:11,750
it's like 20 minutes of reading and
outlets like dance and then then like 20

745
00:42:11,751 --> 00:42:16,070
minutes of math and now let's
sing and you need to mix it up.

746
00:42:16,100 --> 00:42:17,180
That up for the students.

747
00:42:17,450 --> 00:42:21,620
And coding actually fits into the
fun category in elementary school,

748
00:42:21,740 --> 00:42:24,950
which is very, very different. It's not
what the students are teachers expect,

749
00:42:25,190 --> 00:42:26,001
but once they do it,

750
00:42:26,001 --> 00:42:29,900
they realize actually we don't need
to fit it in because of that. Um,

751
00:42:30,350 --> 00:42:31,310
in middle school,

752
00:42:31,311 --> 00:42:36,230
what computer science typically can
replace is outdated tech ed courses.

753
00:42:36,500 --> 00:42:41,180
Every school added Tech Ed to their
middle school programs starting in the

754
00:42:41,180 --> 00:42:43,010
eighties or nineties,
and what they're still teaching today,

755
00:42:43,011 --> 00:42:47,510
there's middle school courses in most
schools teaching how to browse the web,

756
00:42:47,900 --> 00:42:52,520
how to do Internet search, you know,
things like that. And everybody doing it.

757
00:42:52,521 --> 00:42:53,990
The teacher's like, all right, kids,

758
00:42:53,991 --> 00:42:56,950
now we're going to learn how to browse
the web. And the kids were like,

759
00:42:57,350 --> 00:43:00,850
I already know how to do this. What should
I do? And the teacher's like, I dunno,

760
00:43:00,860 --> 00:43:04,940
like, you know, it's, it's that
system wants something to replace it,

761
00:43:04,941 --> 00:43:07,190
which is why schools come to us asking,

762
00:43:07,191 --> 00:43:09,960
what can we replace this crappy
course with? Uh, they actually,

763
00:43:10,100 --> 00:43:12,370
part of the demand we get is
because they realize they're,

764
00:43:12,371 --> 00:43:14,320
they're teaching something outdated.
Um,

765
00:43:14,720 --> 00:43:17,900
in high school you don't need to
replace anything because in high school

766
00:43:17,901 --> 00:43:20,810
students choose what they get to take.
Uh,

767
00:43:20,840 --> 00:43:24,410
so as long as you make a computer
science available for one hour a day,

768
00:43:24,650 --> 00:43:27,920
as long as 25 students enroll,
that hour is full.

769
00:43:27,921 --> 00:43:32,090
That teacher salaries paid for some
other course lost its, you know,

770
00:43:32,091 --> 00:43:35,390
its students and some other
courses we'll have one less hour.

771
00:43:35,391 --> 00:43:38,480
It's being taught in the school needs
to shuffle around the teachers some, uh,

772
00:43:38,481 --> 00:43:40,640
but you don't need to replace something.
And in fact,

773
00:43:40,641 --> 00:43:44,780
what schools regularly find is 50
students sign up and then you need to two

774
00:43:44,781 --> 00:43:46,520
hours a day dedicated to computer science.

775
00:43:46,760 --> 00:43:50,060
And basically the students are choosing
what to replace by voting with their

776
00:43:50,061 --> 00:43:53,000
feet in the schools that
teach computer science.

777
00:43:53,300 --> 00:43:56,600
It's the fastest growing of course
in terms of student enrollment. Uh,

778
00:43:56,660 --> 00:44:00,010
and so students are deciding whatever
it is that they're choosing not to have

779
00:44:00,020 --> 00:44:00,853
time.

780
00:44:01,990 --> 00:44:02,561
I'm curious.

781
00:44:02,561 --> 00:44:06,590
One thing that was surprising to me is
certainly when I went to school, um,

782
00:44:06,790 --> 00:44:10,960
I nobody thought computer
science was fun. Um, and I'm,

783
00:44:11,050 --> 00:44:15,580
I was fascinated by the
stats you sharing. Um, how,

784
00:44:16,030 --> 00:44:19,720
how has that switch happened? I mean,
as a little bit of a chicken and egg,

785
00:44:19,721 --> 00:44:22,690
which is until you try it and you
get the instant gratification,

786
00:44:22,691 --> 00:44:23,950
you don't realize it's fun.

787
00:44:24,280 --> 00:44:27,900
So how do you get students
to try in order for them to,

788
00:44:27,960 --> 00:44:30,880
to realize there's a whole new
world of opportunity there?

789
00:44:31,380 --> 00:44:32,213
Sure.
Um,

790
00:44:33,150 --> 00:44:37,380
the biggest change has been when I
studied computer science and probably when

791
00:44:37,381 --> 00:44:41,280
you did it and probably what most people
in this room study computer science, uh,

792
00:44:41,820 --> 00:44:45,570
the curriculum had been designed I
think from the math establishment,

793
00:44:45,810 --> 00:44:47,520
which isn't bad or wrong,

794
00:44:47,760 --> 00:44:51,540
but it's definitely a more
narrow view of computer science.

795
00:44:51,660 --> 00:44:56,370
As an example, I remember having to
learn recursion and to learn recursion,

796
00:44:56,371 --> 00:45:00,180
I had to write the code to calculate
the FIBONACCI sequence and it's like

797
00:45:00,420 --> 00:45:03,080
recursion is cool,
but the FIBONACCI sequence sucks.

798
00:45:03,081 --> 00:45:05,400
Like who cares about the
FIBONACCI sequence? Uh,

799
00:45:05,820 --> 00:45:08,820
unless you're a math guy and you think
about the patterns and leaves and things

800
00:45:08,821 --> 00:45:12,060
like that, but like it's a
very narrow use of recursion.

801
00:45:12,300 --> 00:45:16,950
You could teach recursion by making a
cool fractal, which is, and then you like,

802
00:45:16,951 --> 00:45:20,460
you're much more likely to show a
fractal to your mom then the Fibonacci

803
00:45:20,461 --> 00:45:24,630
sequence and your mom would be much more
likely to get excited about the fractal

804
00:45:24,631 --> 00:45:26,290
then about a bunch of numbers.
Um,

805
00:45:26,610 --> 00:45:30,330
so the creativity of what the
course is actually teach is,

806
00:45:30,331 --> 00:45:33,840
I think the most important reason,
uh, computer science is more fun.

807
00:45:33,900 --> 00:45:36,000
And that's partly about
changing curriculum.

808
00:45:36,300 --> 00:45:39,690
It's also partly because kids
now have phones and you know,

809
00:45:39,691 --> 00:45:42,990
that little thing I showed you, you can
make something and get it on your phone.

810
00:45:42,991 --> 00:45:46,200
That wasn't possible. Uh, when, when
I was learning computer science,

811
00:45:47,880 --> 00:45:48,713
you have a question,

812
00:45:50,470 --> 00:45:53,430
question of all the amazing
stats you showed to me.

813
00:45:53,431 --> 00:45:58,431
The one that's most amazing is the one
about the number of kids with free and

814
00:45:58,501 --> 00:46:03,501
reduced lunch because that seems very
counter to what I would think that those

815
00:46:05,670 --> 00:46:09,780
kids are in schools where
they tend to have less money,

816
00:46:10,020 --> 00:46:14,460
less ability to buy the infrastructured
by the, the computers for them to use.

817
00:46:14,850 --> 00:46:19,850
So I was curious if you could talk
a little bit about how and why,

818
00:46:20,630 --> 00:46:25,630
what you need to do to get a stat like
that and some of your philosophy behind

819
00:46:26,461 --> 00:46:29,000
that. Sure. Um, by the way,

820
00:46:29,001 --> 00:46:33,830
Larry works a bit at Code Dot Archies
his 20% time project I'd Google is to

821
00:46:33,831 --> 00:46:37,850
volunteer for us.
And we were very thankful for his time at.

822
00:46:38,780 --> 00:46:42,170
So in terms of the,
the questions you asked,

823
00:46:42,590 --> 00:46:46,430
the first thing I'd say is
that the majority of schools
have adequate computing

824
00:46:46,431 --> 00:46:50,600
and Internet access infrastructure
to be able to teach computer science.

825
00:46:51,020 --> 00:46:56,020
Most schools don't have one
to one computing in order
to teach math on computers

826
00:46:57,020 --> 00:47:01,100
because every student takes math
every day of every school year. Uh,

827
00:47:01,101 --> 00:47:03,440
and so you'd need every kid
to have their own computer.

828
00:47:03,470 --> 00:47:05,210
If you want to move math and English and,

829
00:47:05,510 --> 00:47:07,760
and sort of those fields onto computers,

830
00:47:07,940 --> 00:47:10,940
you need way more computers and
way more Internet bandwidth.

831
00:47:11,240 --> 00:47:15,980
Computer Science is either taught in
elementary school one hour a week,

832
00:47:16,010 --> 00:47:19,520
which means the kids cycle through
it or it's, if it's in high school,

833
00:47:19,521 --> 00:47:21,890
it's an optional class and
not every student takes it.

834
00:47:22,160 --> 00:47:26,330
And so you need about 30 computers for
every thousand kids and 90 something,

835
00:47:26,331 --> 00:47:30,070
96% of schools have that
and they're internet. Uh,

836
00:47:30,580 --> 00:47:33,580
it's not all schools, but other
than the 4% that don't have that,

837
00:47:33,820 --> 00:47:38,620
most schools have adequate computing
infrastructure and our stuff we work go

838
00:47:38,621 --> 00:47:42,310
through the trouble of making sure it
works on older computers with smaller

839
00:47:42,311 --> 00:47:45,810
resolutions and things like that.
Uh,

840
00:47:46,420 --> 00:47:47,410
the other thing that's,

841
00:47:47,590 --> 00:47:51,250
that's counterintuitive that people
don't expect cause they're stereotypes is

842
00:47:51,251 --> 00:47:52,084
this.

843
00:47:52,090 --> 00:47:56,380
I think there's a stereotype that kids
in these underprivileged schools are less

844
00:47:56,381 --> 00:47:59,090
capable and it's not true at all.
They're there,

845
00:47:59,640 --> 00:48:02,470
especially if you get to
them young. Um, in fact,

846
00:48:02,471 --> 00:48:05,650
we just did data analysis of
our AP computer science course,

847
00:48:05,940 --> 00:48:10,940
which is the college level course
comparing the diversity in our computer

848
00:48:11,411 --> 00:48:15,880
science classroom to the diversity of
the entire school itself. Uh, you know,

849
00:48:15,881 --> 00:48:19,150
so if the school had 60%
underrepresented kids,

850
00:48:19,600 --> 00:48:22,520
what percentage in our classroom we're,
you know,

851
00:48:22,810 --> 00:48:26,980
black or Hispanic students versus
a school that had 20%. And, uh,

852
00:48:27,590 --> 00:48:31,540
if we plotted every school on this map
and they almost perfectly lined up with

853
00:48:31,541 --> 00:48:35,650
the, uh, the line of basically,
you know, a slope, one line,

854
00:48:35,830 --> 00:48:40,240
meaning diversity in our computer science
classrooms matched at the diversity of

855
00:48:40,241 --> 00:48:43,620
the school from a, from a
race standpoint. Uh, and,

856
00:48:43,621 --> 00:48:47,860
and this really gets to the point that
the issue we have is access in schools

857
00:48:47,861 --> 00:48:49,300
that don't teach computer science.

858
00:48:49,450 --> 00:48:52,870
None of those kids are learning in the
schools that do teach computer science.

859
00:48:53,080 --> 00:48:58,080
The representation matches both racial
diversity and socioeconomic diversity of

860
00:48:58,211 --> 00:49:02,320
the students. Gender diversity
is harder. Gender diversity,

861
00:49:02,321 --> 00:49:05,380
kids stereotypes, mess with
them. And the girls, Cinco,

862
00:49:05,410 --> 00:49:07,610
this course isn't for me because you know,
I,

863
00:49:07,870 --> 00:49:11,860
from all the movies I've watched the
people doing that are like these white 18

864
00:49:11,861 --> 00:49:15,310
year old boys in a dark basement with
an energy drink and a star wars poster.

865
00:49:15,311 --> 00:49:18,730
And like, that's not me and I
don't want to live that life. Uh,

866
00:49:18,970 --> 00:49:21,880
and that holds back a
lot of women, uh, but on,

867
00:49:21,910 --> 00:49:24,910
on socioeconomic diversity
and racial diversity,

868
00:49:25,120 --> 00:49:27,940
it's much more that they just literally
don't have it in their classroom.

869
00:49:28,120 --> 00:49:32,270
And so they don't get the chance.
Shiny.

870
00:49:32,440 --> 00:49:35,890
That room here is curious to know
how can Google, there's health,

871
00:49:37,480 --> 00:49:42,250
there's lots of ways Googlers can
help. Uh, if you look on our website,

872
00:49:42,251 --> 00:49:46,690
there's a button called help us,
uh, or it's code.org/help. Uh,

873
00:49:46,960 --> 00:49:50,920
the easiest way to help is to follow us
on Facebook or Twitter and to retweet

874
00:49:50,921 --> 00:49:52,480
the stuff we share.
Uh,

875
00:49:52,690 --> 00:49:56,500
the next easiest ways to
buy one of our hats or,

876
00:49:56,950 --> 00:49:57,783
or socks.

877
00:49:59,620 --> 00:50:02,890
We have code like a girl shirts that
are super cool and very popular.

878
00:50:02,891 --> 00:50:06,370
Just buying our swag. Uh, it doesn't
make as much money when you do that,

879
00:50:06,371 --> 00:50:07,330
but if you wear them,

880
00:50:07,540 --> 00:50:10,450
it helps spread the idea that computer
science is something that everybody

881
00:50:10,451 --> 00:50:11,284
should do.
Uh,

882
00:50:11,330 --> 00:50:15,070
but there's many other ways and there's
a list of them at donating to us is

883
00:50:15,071 --> 00:50:16,710
always appreciated.
Uh,

884
00:50:16,750 --> 00:50:20,760
telling google.org to continue supporting
us as a very important, uh, you know,

885
00:50:20,770 --> 00:50:22,570
Google's foundation branch,

886
00:50:22,571 --> 00:50:27,040
google.org as one of our top supporters
and the way they decide where to give

887
00:50:27,140 --> 00:50:30,740
money. A lot of that comes from
feedback from Googlers. Uh, you know,

888
00:50:30,741 --> 00:50:34,190
most corporations make their
decisions top down as, you know,

889
00:50:34,191 --> 00:50:38,640
Google's decisions are made in this sort
of weird neural network kind of way. Uh,

890
00:50:38,990 --> 00:50:42,410
and, and literally when we
talked to the folks@google.org,

891
00:50:42,411 --> 00:50:47,300
they talk about whether they're hearing
about code.org from the, you know,

892
00:50:47,540 --> 00:50:50,990
the hive mind of Google.
So however that works,

893
00:50:50,991 --> 00:50:54,510
if you could communicate to the foundation
side of the hive mind that you're

894
00:50:54,530 --> 00:50:57,780
excited about their support
for Google dot for code.org ad,

895
00:50:57,790 --> 00:50:59,210
that would be really helpful as well.

896
00:51:00,570 --> 00:51:01,403
I guess similarly,

897
00:51:01,510 --> 00:51:05,760
how can technology companies health more
holistically other than the individual

898
00:51:05,880 --> 00:51:07,110
technology employees?

899
00:51:08,080 --> 00:51:11,500
Financial support is a
really big part of it.

900
00:51:11,530 --> 00:51:15,960
And Google is not our top supporter. I
think they're number four or five. Uh,

901
00:51:16,240 --> 00:51:20,980
but the work we do costs real money,
uh, and, and that really matters,

902
00:51:21,010 --> 00:51:25,630
you know, uh, but then employee
volunteering is also super helpful.

903
00:51:25,820 --> 00:51:26,450
Uh,

904
00:51:26,450 --> 00:51:29,590
there's a page code.org/health which
lists these things and one of them is the

905
00:51:29,630 --> 00:51:33,700
signup as a volunteer to basically help
teachers and classrooms and inspire

906
00:51:33,701 --> 00:51:36,820
students. Uh, and, and that's
another great way as well.

907
00:51:37,990 --> 00:51:42,910
Um, so I've been told to wrap
it up. Um, and, uh, how do you,

908
00:51:42,911 --> 00:51:46,160
I'll just leave it up to you
for your closing words. Um,

909
00:51:46,650 --> 00:51:48,400
and I think that would be
the best use of our time.

910
00:51:48,510 --> 00:51:51,180
Okay. Um, I'll stick around if
there's any other questions.

911
00:51:51,500 --> 00:51:52,800
The one thing I'd say in closing,

912
00:51:52,801 --> 00:51:57,390
and I kind of said this already as it's
been unreal that our education system

913
00:51:57,391 --> 00:52:01,770
has changed to embrace computer science
at the pace it has. And in fact, every,

914
00:52:02,220 --> 00:52:04,000
almost every week or two weeks,
I,

915
00:52:04,060 --> 00:52:06,630
I still need to remind myself
that this is actually happening.

916
00:52:07,550 --> 00:52:12,420
One crazy example of this is just the
very recent momentum in just the last six

917
00:52:12,421 --> 00:52:17,421
weeks for entire countries decided to
do national rollouts of computer science

918
00:52:17,810 --> 00:52:21,450
for their entire country, uh,
almost one country every week.

919
00:52:21,700 --> 00:52:24,540
And it's been hard for us to even keep
up on reporting the news because it

920
00:52:24,541 --> 00:52:26,790
changes so quickly. Uh, but that,

921
00:52:26,820 --> 00:52:31,560
that change is entirely
because of teachers deciding
that this is important and

922
00:52:31,561 --> 00:52:33,350
doing it in a grassroots way at,

923
00:52:33,480 --> 00:52:36,060
and this is really one of the best
stories I think in America today.

924
00:52:36,061 --> 00:52:41,040
We were living in this weird divided time.
Our country is in a bit of a funk.

925
00:52:41,130 --> 00:52:41,850
Uh,

926
00:52:41,850 --> 00:52:44,880
I don't think there's as
many very Americans who think
that America is sort of,

927
00:52:45,510 --> 00:52:47,820
you know, all it could be,
you're doing super great,

928
00:52:48,120 --> 00:52:51,780
but what we're doing in
America's classrooms with
computer science is incredibly

929
00:52:51,781 --> 00:52:55,290
great, and it's not just helping America.
It's really helping changing the world.

930
00:52:55,530 --> 00:52:58,050
And that's something I think every
American could be very proud of.

931
00:53:00,480 --> 00:53:03,470
Thank you for joining us.
Really appreciate everything you've done.
