1
00:00:06,040 --> 00:00:07,680
Thanks for,
thanks for everybody coming out.

2
00:00:07,681 --> 00:00:10,410
It's great to see so many of your
hair. Uh, I'm just, I'm smart.

3
00:00:10,411 --> 00:00:14,060
I'm a engineer on the Google assistant
team and I'm just going to introduce the

4
00:00:14,070 --> 00:00:16,520
Dan and Rosie who are thrilled
to have with us today. Um,

5
00:00:16,620 --> 00:00:19,910
I'm curious how many of you guys got
to see this piece while it was, uh,

6
00:00:19,950 --> 00:00:24,120
by the subway cars in
outside five VB? Yeah. Cool.

7
00:00:24,270 --> 00:00:26,550
For those of you who haven't, I really
encourage you to stick around afterwards,

8
00:00:26,551 --> 00:00:29,340
get right up close to it and you'll see
all these incredible surprising details

9
00:00:29,341 --> 00:00:33,000
that the AI is imbued into this piece.
And you'll hear all about that from Dan.

10
00:00:33,220 --> 00:00:35,280
Uh, my connection to it is just that, uh,

11
00:00:35,310 --> 00:00:38,970
we used to know each other from a previous
company that I was in and when Dan

12
00:00:38,971 --> 00:00:41,130
started working on this
computational photography stuff,

13
00:00:41,370 --> 00:00:45,420
he saw deep dream is an opportunity to
work it in and kind of an artistic way

14
00:00:45,421 --> 00:00:46,380
and asked if I could help him.

15
00:00:46,380 --> 00:00:49,980
And I didn't really know anything
about the software and I thought, okay,

16
00:00:50,040 --> 00:00:51,000
you know,
how hard could this be?

17
00:00:51,001 --> 00:00:53,310
And of course these things always turn
out to be a lot more complicated than you

18
00:00:53,311 --> 00:00:55,470
thought. I'll go into a
little bit of that afterwards.

19
00:00:55,471 --> 00:00:57,290
But what was really fascinating to me is,
you know,

20
00:00:57,390 --> 00:01:00,090
this all kind of started because of
New York City and that's why it's so

21
00:01:00,091 --> 00:01:02,760
exciting to have it here.
About 50 years ago today,

22
00:01:02,761 --> 00:01:04,830
almost right there was maybe 51 by now.

23
00:01:05,100 --> 00:01:09,150
There was one of the very first art plus
technology shows in New York City ever

24
00:01:09,660 --> 00:01:12,030
called nine evenings.
And about 50 years later,

25
00:01:12,031 --> 00:01:14,670
a bunch of the people decided it would
be really cool to do a retrospective and

26
00:01:14,671 --> 00:01:16,980
kind of a new show.
And they decided to do it out in Seattle.

27
00:01:17,370 --> 00:01:19,950
And Dan was one of the artists that were
commissioned to build a piece for nine

28
00:01:19,951 --> 00:01:23,040
evenings too. And so he shot it in New
York City. This is for those of you,

29
00:01:23,070 --> 00:01:25,710
it's not obvious, it's the Azalea
walk inside of Central Park.

30
00:01:26,270 --> 00:01:28,590
And so it sort of coming from
New York with New York content,

31
00:01:28,591 --> 00:01:31,800
but of course with a much more modern
twist and after it finished touring a few

32
00:01:31,801 --> 00:01:34,860
places in Seattle, he thought, wouldn't
it be cool to bring it back to Manhattan?

33
00:01:35,100 --> 00:01:37,230
And Google was excited to be able to
take it and put it in the building.

34
00:01:37,231 --> 00:01:39,930
So it's kind of neat to kind of bring it
full circle. And while Dan was in town,

35
00:01:39,931 --> 00:01:41,970
I thought it would be great for him to
talk through because it's not just sort

36
00:01:41,971 --> 00:01:42,631
of release for me.

37
00:01:42,631 --> 00:01:46,470
It's really cool to hear about the neat
photography tricks and the computer

38
00:01:46,471 --> 00:01:47,310
tricks that was necessary.

39
00:01:47,311 --> 00:01:51,180
But there's also a whole sort of art
history that Dan has of how people over

40
00:01:51,181 --> 00:01:53,910
time figured out how to paint these
compelling landscapes and compositional

41
00:01:53,911 --> 00:01:55,050
elements.
That was really new to me.

42
00:01:55,051 --> 00:01:57,150
So I hope that'll be
interesting to you guys as well.

43
00:01:57,360 --> 00:02:00,270
And afterwards we've got some refreshments
and stick around for the reception.

44
00:02:00,271 --> 00:02:02,060
You get a chance to talk
to Dan Moore and uh,

45
00:02:02,070 --> 00:02:04,020
we'll leave plenty of time for Q and.
A. So with that I'll turn it over.

46
00:02:04,080 --> 00:02:04,913
Thanks a lot.

47
00:02:05,980 --> 00:02:09,220
[inaudible]

48
00:02:09,350 --> 00:02:12,420
thanks Joseph, and thanks to
you all for being here. Um,

49
00:02:12,680 --> 00:02:16,070
my plan here is to take you
through the art history,

50
00:02:16,130 --> 00:02:20,900
the technology and the psychology
even behind our dreamscapes project.

51
00:02:21,560 --> 00:02:24,830
I hope you're going to find this fun and
perhaps learn some new things along the

52
00:02:24,831 --> 00:02:29,180
way. Just a heads up that, um, all
of the images in this presentation,

53
00:02:29,181 --> 00:02:31,940
unless otherwise noted,
are my own work.

54
00:02:33,650 --> 00:02:36,980
So let's talk about special places.

55
00:02:37,790 --> 00:02:41,780
What I mean by that are precise locations
in our world where something very

56
00:02:41,781 --> 00:02:45,980
powerful happens.
And I'm not just talking about landscapes,

57
00:02:46,040 --> 00:02:50,000
but also city scapes
and even indoor spaces.

58
00:02:51,020 --> 00:02:55,070
I mean, have you ever noticed that
in certain places at certain times,

59
00:02:55,460 --> 00:02:59,860
the scene before you goes beyond a mere
sight and become something you feel in

60
00:02:59,861 --> 00:03:00,460
your body?

61
00:03:00,460 --> 00:03:04,270
Does anyone ever had that experience
hiking or skiing or something like that?

62
00:03:05,230 --> 00:03:09,190
Whenever I find myself in the midst of
scenes like that, it's like a bell rings.

63
00:03:09,220 --> 00:03:12,670
It just stops me dead in my tracks.
Um,

64
00:03:12,940 --> 00:03:17,940
what starts then as a visual experience
immediately becomes a visceral response.

65
00:03:20,890 --> 00:03:25,480
One that I feel right in the middle of
my chest usually because it makes me gasp

66
00:03:26,440 --> 00:03:28,930
and when I've seen is powerful
enough to make that happen.

67
00:03:29,740 --> 00:03:33,070
I found myself waxing philosophical,
asking questions like,

68
00:03:33,520 --> 00:03:36,250
I wonder how a butterfly would see this,
you know?

69
00:03:36,251 --> 00:03:40,390
Or what if my vision was many times
sharper? What's real? Anyway, you know,

70
00:03:40,391 --> 00:03:45,391
Physics explains and tells us how we see
the world through very limited filter,

71
00:03:47,770 --> 00:03:50,500
so I'm sure many of you have
experienced something like this too,

72
00:03:50,530 --> 00:03:52,390
in the presence of special places,

73
00:03:52,391 --> 00:03:57,391
this powerful connection that's
quickly formed between your eyes,

74
00:03:57,461 --> 00:03:58,960
your body and your mind,

75
00:04:00,790 --> 00:04:04,990
and if you're like me and many other
people in the history of mankind,

76
00:04:04,991 --> 00:04:09,991
I suspect you then find
yourself desperately wanting
to bottle that experience

77
00:04:11,171 --> 00:04:14,590
with such fidelity that when
you share it with others later,

78
00:04:14,710 --> 00:04:17,500
the same thing happens to them.
Right?

79
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:20,020
Also like me,

80
00:04:20,470 --> 00:04:24,160
you may have found it very hard to
do that with traditional photography.

81
00:04:24,280 --> 00:04:25,930
This drove me crazy.

82
00:04:26,680 --> 00:04:31,180
It had me wondering what constitutes
this phenomenon and how can it be

83
00:04:31,181 --> 00:04:35,740
communicated? Is it even
possible? The answer is yes.

84
00:04:36,070 --> 00:04:39,190
Let me show you how it turns out.

85
00:04:39,460 --> 00:04:44,230
We have an existence proof the great
American painters of the Hudson River

86
00:04:44,231 --> 00:04:49,231
school in the early 18 hundreds and the
European romanticist before them achieve

87
00:04:49,661 --> 00:04:53,140
this effect.
They painted highly detailed scenes,

88
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:55,560
some of which were 10 feet wider,

89
00:04:55,600 --> 00:05:00,070
more with great emotional impact.
Painters like Thomas Cole,

90
00:05:00,071 --> 00:05:04,360
who's considered the founder of the
Hudson River school and is incredibly

91
00:05:04,361 --> 00:05:05,440
skilled friend Asher,

92
00:05:05,441 --> 00:05:10,441
B Duran and several others created
many powerful works like these

93
00:05:12,670 --> 00:05:13,091
coals.

94
00:05:13,091 --> 00:05:17,860
Protege Frederick Edmund Church was
hugely successful at doing this.

95
00:05:18,070 --> 00:05:21,730
Let's talk about this painting for a
minute is called the heart of the Andes.

96
00:05:22,390 --> 00:05:27,340
When this five and a half foot high by
10 foot wide masterpiece debuted in 1859

97
00:05:27,760 --> 00:05:29,770
it was an absolute sensation.

98
00:05:31,070 --> 00:05:34,960
It was first exhibited in New York
City as a single painting exhibition.

99
00:05:36,100 --> 00:05:40,990
In four weeks. More than 12,000 people
paid admission to view this painting.

100
00:05:41,860 --> 00:05:46,690
It was set up in this interesting little
stage with a skylight putting light on

101
00:05:46,691 --> 00:05:50,290
it in a darkened room.
They had benches set up,

102
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:55,090
they handed people opera glasses.
People were crazy about this thing.

103
00:05:55,150 --> 00:05:59,000
Um,
the painting was widely acclaimed.

104
00:05:59,420 --> 00:06:03,290
Poetry was written in its honor.
A composer dedicated a piece to it.

105
00:06:03,590 --> 00:06:04,910
Mark Twain wrote about it.

106
00:06:06,110 --> 00:06:10,010
The following quote proves my point that
it is indeed possible to capture and

107
00:06:10,011 --> 00:06:14,450
convey the power of a special place.
A contemporary witness wrote this,

108
00:06:15,140 --> 00:06:16,460
women felt faint.

109
00:06:17,660 --> 00:06:21,980
Both men and women succumb to the dizzy
and combination of terror and vertigo

110
00:06:21,981 --> 00:06:24,110
that they recognized as the sublime.

111
00:06:24,650 --> 00:06:28,460
Many of them will later describe as
sensation of becoming immersed in or

112
00:06:28,461 --> 00:06:32,990
absorbed by this painting
who's dimensions, presentation
and subject matters.

113
00:06:32,990 --> 00:06:36,440
Speak of the divine power of nature.
So by the way,

114
00:06:36,441 --> 00:06:39,980
this painting hangs up town at the met.
Now, if you haven't already done done so,

115
00:06:39,981 --> 00:06:41,270
you should really see it in person.

116
00:06:41,750 --> 00:06:45,200
Joseph just sought for the first time
on Sunday. What did you think? Amazing.

117
00:06:46,830 --> 00:06:51,680
Um, before I get into exactly how Frederic
Church and his contemporaries did what

118
00:06:51,681 --> 00:06:55,310
they did, I want to mention one more
panel who was very influential to me.

119
00:06:55,340 --> 00:06:59,420
Maxfield Parrish Parrish came
along much later, in fact,

120
00:06:59,421 --> 00:07:04,421
well after the art world had moved on
from representational landscape painting,

121
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:10,490
but he brought a level of vibrancy and
lucidity to his work that I absolutely

122
00:07:10,491 --> 00:07:12,890
love and which really
hadn't been seen before.

123
00:07:13,310 --> 00:07:15,380
I don't have time to explain
how he did what he did,

124
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:19,940
but one thing I can relate to is that
he did it by tinkering and experimenting

125
00:07:19,941 --> 00:07:22,790
with both old and new
approaches to his medium.

126
00:07:24,060 --> 00:07:24,890
Okay.

127
00:07:24,890 --> 00:07:28,790
Okay. Now let's get into the how. I'll
use my own work to illustrate this.

128
00:07:28,820 --> 00:07:33,740
Starting with this scene that I
captured at Nymph Lake in Rocky Mountain

129
00:07:33,740 --> 00:07:36,890
National Park, Colorado
in healthcare design,

130
00:07:36,920 --> 00:07:41,660
there's been a lot of research around
what is known as healing art designers and

131
00:07:41,661 --> 00:07:43,250
administrators wanted to know.

132
00:07:44,510 --> 00:07:45,040
Yeah.

133
00:07:45,040 --> 00:07:49,690
What kind of art, if any, can
reliably make patients feel better?

134
00:07:50,320 --> 00:07:52,750
Well, it turns out there
is only one kind that does,

135
00:07:52,930 --> 00:07:55,090
and that's representational
landscape scenes.

136
00:07:55,810 --> 00:08:00,610
Healthcare design consultant Barbara
Lyons Stewart wrote every evidence based

137
00:08:00,611 --> 00:08:04,850
design study I found has proven that
only viewing representational landscape

138
00:08:04,851 --> 00:08:07,780
scenes measurably decreases heart rate,

139
00:08:07,781 --> 00:08:10,660
blood pressure and pain
while improving mood.

140
00:08:11,830 --> 00:08:15,580
Some people refer to this effect
as the pastoral experience,

141
00:08:16,150 --> 00:08:17,440
but when you dig into this,

142
00:08:17,650 --> 00:08:22,390
you find out the pastoral experience is
not achieved by subject matter alone.

143
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:27,610
It actually requires four things.
Subject matter, composition,

144
00:08:27,790 --> 00:08:32,680
technique and presentation. Let's
briefly considered these one at a time.

145
00:08:32,681 --> 00:08:33,820
Starting with subject matter.

146
00:08:35,740 --> 00:08:40,000
The pastoral experience occurs with
scenes featuring things like greenfields.

147
00:08:41,350 --> 00:08:46,180
It also includes water scenes,
Heelan, country scenes,

148
00:08:47,770 --> 00:08:51,640
sweeping views,
coastal views,

149
00:08:53,260 --> 00:08:56,430
Marsha's
farm land,

150
00:08:57,660 --> 00:09:01,410
groves of trees,
beautiful Vestas,

151
00:09:02,670 --> 00:09:05,790
sunrises and sunsets.

152
00:09:07,140 --> 00:09:10,200
But like I said,
it's not just about subject matter.

153
00:09:10,350 --> 00:09:14,070
It's also about composition and
a guide to evidence based art.

154
00:09:14,280 --> 00:09:17,970
The author specifically mentioned
immersion compatibility and extent

155
00:09:19,530 --> 00:09:24,330
immersion is best achieved with the
presence of strong foreground elements and

156
00:09:24,331 --> 00:09:25,620
or wide fields of view.

157
00:09:27,270 --> 00:09:32,270
Compatibility refers to the resonance
between the natural setting and human

158
00:09:32,881 --> 00:09:34,830
inclinations.
Essentially,

159
00:09:34,831 --> 00:09:38,250
manmade elements subconsciously
make the viewer feel safe.

160
00:09:38,370 --> 00:09:40,650
They sense that other
people are thriving there

161
00:09:42,390 --> 00:09:46,680
and then there's extent
which is characterized by
scenes of distant wilderness

162
00:09:46,710 --> 00:09:51,570
trails and paths leading to
idyllic destinations and a
sense of being connected

163
00:09:51,571 --> 00:09:55,470
to a larger world.
This quote really sums it up.

164
00:09:55,890 --> 00:10:00,000
The most fundamental feature
of a restorative place is
that people have to feel

165
00:10:00,120 --> 00:10:03,120
that they can move into those spaces
and have a wonderful experience.

166
00:10:05,910 --> 00:10:07,560
Okay.
Now let's talk about technique.

167
00:10:07,980 --> 00:10:11,370
How do we achieve the pastoral
effect with a digital camera?

168
00:10:11,850 --> 00:10:15,050
With the digital cameras?
It'll start with, it starts
with something I call x, Y,

169
00:10:15,051 --> 00:10:18,480
Z photography. You'll see why I call
it that in just a minute. First,

170
00:10:18,481 --> 00:10:19,500
let me tell you about the gear.

171
00:10:20,460 --> 00:10:24,600
The Sony Rx one was the first full
frame sensor compact camera when it was

172
00:10:24,601 --> 00:10:26,190
released a bit more than four years ago.

173
00:10:26,430 --> 00:10:30,510
It's got everything I need and nothing
more and incredibly small foreign factor,

174
00:10:31,220 --> 00:10:34,590
a beautiful fix,
35 millimeter Carl Zeiss Lens,

175
00:10:35,220 --> 00:10:39,000
and the new version has a
whopping 42.4 megapixel sensor

176
00:10:40,770 --> 00:10:42,300
with a small camera like this one,

177
00:10:42,960 --> 00:10:47,310
I can get away with a fairly compact
tripod on top of which is a similarly

178
00:10:47,311 --> 00:10:51,240
compact but very important contraption
called a panoramic tripod head,

179
00:10:51,690 --> 00:10:55,440
which gives me a precise way to capture
overlapping views of the scene on the

180
00:10:55,441 --> 00:11:00,000
shooting and that's all I need.
With this compact setup,

181
00:11:00,810 --> 00:11:02,940
I then capture multiple
views horizontally.

182
00:11:02,941 --> 00:11:05,130
Let's call that x
multiple views vertically.

183
00:11:05,131 --> 00:11:09,300
Let's call that y and multiple
exposures deep from dark to light.

184
00:11:09,780 --> 00:11:14,460
Let's call that Z. It's not really depth.
It has nothing to do with distance.

185
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:18,300
It's it's about capturing a higher dynamic
range of exposures from underexposed,

186
00:11:18,330 --> 00:11:23,330
overexposed to more closely match how
our IC instead of how the camera sees on

187
00:11:24,571 --> 00:11:27,720
average, it takes me about a
minute to capture the entire scene.

188
00:11:29,300 --> 00:11:33,690
I then use three different commercial
software packages to merge this cubic

189
00:11:33,691 --> 00:11:36,420
array of photos into a coherent scene.

190
00:11:36,990 --> 00:11:40,590
I blend them multiple exposures
from front to back with Aurora HDR.

191
00:11:41,280 --> 00:11:46,280
I stitch together the multiple views
with auto panel pro and then I crop in

192
00:11:46,441 --> 00:11:47,274
Sweden.

193
00:11:47,490 --> 00:11:50,940
The image with Photoshop and what I mean
by Sweden is all I really do is adjust

194
00:11:50,941 --> 00:11:55,120
the tonal range just a little
bit to take to reduce the haze.

195
00:11:55,180 --> 00:12:00,180
Really now I'm calling these interim
results because you may have noticed I

196
00:12:01,271 --> 00:12:04,600
haven't yet started talking about the
artificial intelligence element that I

197
00:12:04,601 --> 00:12:08,320
introduced to my work, uh, last
year, but we'll do that in a minute.

198
00:12:09,850 --> 00:12:12,340
With the technique of Xyz photography,

199
00:12:12,370 --> 00:12:15,760
you end up with a scene that's more
immersive due to the wide angles,

200
00:12:15,761 --> 00:12:20,740
both the x and the lie I've seen that's
more vivid due to the high dynamic

201
00:12:20,741 --> 00:12:21,910
range,
the Z,

202
00:12:23,590 --> 00:12:27,550
and I've seen that as much higher fidelity
containing up to 200 times as many

203
00:12:27,551 --> 00:12:32,551
pixels as the HDTV and up to 10 to 40
times as many pixels as you'll get with a

204
00:12:32,711 --> 00:12:33,910
pro DSLR camera.

205
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:38,380
What you're seeing here is a non retouched
photo of a four foot high by eight

206
00:12:38,381 --> 00:12:42,310
foot wide light box that shows the kind
of detail and richness we're talking

207
00:12:42,311 --> 00:12:43,144
about.

208
00:12:44,380 --> 00:12:47,560
I put this graphic together to
illustrate the Xyz difference.

209
00:12:47,580 --> 00:12:51,250
The the inset photo you see here on the
right is what you get with a high end

210
00:12:51,251 --> 00:12:55,210
camera capturing a single exposure
with a 35 millimeter lens.

211
00:12:55,810 --> 00:12:59,680
You can see that the Xyz method deals
an image that is much more immersive,

212
00:12:59,681 --> 00:13:02,170
more vibrant,
and much higher resolution.

213
00:13:03,880 --> 00:13:07,930
So finally we have to talk about
presentation to be most impactful.

214
00:13:09,310 --> 00:13:11,320
These scenes should be printed,
in my opinion,

215
00:13:11,350 --> 00:13:14,980
no less than eight feet wide
and they should be backlit.

216
00:13:15,460 --> 00:13:18,830
We are creatures of light.
We're drawn to light. Um,

217
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:22,870
that's why I've been so
focused on producing light
boxes these last few years.

218
00:13:23,410 --> 00:13:26,260
A big bonus about lightboxes is this,
their containers.

219
00:13:26,290 --> 00:13:30,070
It's very easy to replace the
image, uh, to keep things fresh.

220
00:13:32,890 --> 00:13:37,510
So it turns out the entire time I was
conducting my Xyz photography experiments,

221
00:13:38,260 --> 00:13:41,830
there's been this incredible revolution
in artificial intelligence and deep

222
00:13:41,831 --> 00:13:45,100
learning. Thanks perhaps to
some of the people in this room.

223
00:13:46,930 --> 00:13:49,630
I'll let Joseph speak more
about this in depth after me,

224
00:13:49,690 --> 00:13:52,570
but in July,
2015,

225
00:13:53,050 --> 00:13:57,610
your company released a bit of open
source software called deep dream that

226
00:13:57,611 --> 00:14:01,930
became a viral sensation. How many of you
were aware of that when that happened?

227
00:14:03,190 --> 00:14:06,370
A few. Okay. So as I understand it,

228
00:14:06,790 --> 00:14:10,870
deep dream was originally created to help
your researchers understand how their

229
00:14:10,990 --> 00:14:12,370
own software was working.

230
00:14:12,550 --> 00:14:17,550
And what they found when they applied
deep dream to image recognition was that

231
00:14:17,801 --> 00:14:21,310
the machine was essentially hallucinating
as it was trying to figure out what it

232
00:14:21,311 --> 00:14:25,060
was saying after they decided
to release the software.

233
00:14:25,390 --> 00:14:29,350
The Internet went crazy
per these headlines.

234
00:14:29,740 --> 00:14:34,740
What most people did with this was
they turn their family photos and to

235
00:14:35,201 --> 00:14:39,730
psychedelic nightmares.
Now,

236
00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:42,100
these are not my own,
but as you can see here,

237
00:14:42,101 --> 00:14:45,460
some of these results were
quite intriguing. I, however,

238
00:14:45,461 --> 00:14:48,790
since an opportunity to do
something a bit more subtle.

239
00:14:51,230 --> 00:14:56,230
So I tried applying deep dream with a
light touch to some of my low resolution

240
00:14:56,421 --> 00:15:00,170
previews of my landscape images.
The results were very well received,

241
00:15:00,171 --> 00:15:05,171
but really excited me was this opportunity
to add a level of expressiveness to

242
00:15:05,901 --> 00:15:08,300
my last scapes that could be very rich.

243
00:15:09,710 --> 00:15:14,000
And just like the art world in the 18
hundreds began moving to more expressive,

244
00:15:14,001 --> 00:15:16,310
individualized modes
of painting landscapes,

245
00:15:16,311 --> 00:15:21,311
starting with the pronto impressionism
of JMW Turner and later the true

246
00:15:21,321 --> 00:15:23,030
impressionism seen for example,

247
00:15:23,031 --> 00:15:27,890
in the pointillism of Serah and the
unique styles of folks like Cezanne and

248
00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:31,100
Monet. I thought I too
might be able to, you know,

249
00:15:31,101 --> 00:15:34,400
take my landscapes in a new direction.
Unfortunately,

250
00:15:34,430 --> 00:15:39,430
deep dream as released was simply not
designed to operate on multi hundred

251
00:15:40,461 --> 00:15:45,080
megapixel images. It would just
crash and I was completely stuck.

252
00:15:45,680 --> 00:15:50,240
So that's when I thought of my
friend at Google. Joseph Smart. Um,

253
00:15:50,870 --> 00:15:52,820
and much to my delight and amazement,

254
00:15:53,210 --> 00:15:57,110
Joseph actually agreed to help
me and he interned, coerced,

255
00:15:57,170 --> 00:16:02,030
I mean convinced his friend Chris
Lamb, uh, and video to help him.

256
00:16:02,780 --> 00:16:04,460
And this was a huge stroke of luck for me.

257
00:16:04,461 --> 00:16:09,050
Cause when you think about the kind of
DNA you need to work on a project like

258
00:16:09,051 --> 00:16:13,460
this, no pun intended, Chris and
Joseph were truly a dream team.

259
00:16:14,300 --> 00:16:18,650
So it turns out it took a lot of work
to keep deep dream from crashing on my

260
00:16:18,651 --> 00:16:20,330
images. Uh, when I'm done,

261
00:16:20,331 --> 00:16:24,020
Joseph will share more details about
the challenges they faced and how they

262
00:16:24,021 --> 00:16:27,260
overcame them. But after months
of hacking on nights and weekends,

263
00:16:28,130 --> 00:16:29,960
by November,
2015,

264
00:16:30,020 --> 00:16:34,520
they finally got it working using a
monster compute server with four graphics

265
00:16:34,521 --> 00:16:37,430
processing units up on the Amazon cloud.

266
00:16:38,090 --> 00:16:42,770
My job would then be learn how to tune
the parameters of deep dream for the best

267
00:16:42,771 --> 00:16:46,310
results on my landscape images.
A couple of months after that,

268
00:16:46,340 --> 00:16:50,030
in January, 2016, they
handed me this interface.

269
00:16:50,600 --> 00:16:54,320
So let me explain this a little and
take you through my workflow first.

270
00:16:54,321 --> 00:16:58,850
There's the fact that I have for GPS
graphics processing units at my disposal.

271
00:16:59,570 --> 00:17:03,830
This means I can experiment very quickly
trying out four different dreaming

272
00:17:03,831 --> 00:17:06,650
tests at a time,
at least on low resolution previous.

273
00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:12,520
This allows me to rapidly converge on a
combination of parameter settings that I

274
00:17:13,071 --> 00:17:17,270
feel is most compatible with my source
imagery. Speaking of parameters,

275
00:17:17,271 --> 00:17:21,620
there's five that I get to fiddle with.
One main one and four sub parameters.

276
00:17:22,190 --> 00:17:25,100
The main parameter is
the target layer name.

277
00:17:26,390 --> 00:17:31,390
Deep Dream has released has 84 of these
layers and they tend to range from their

278
00:17:33,111 --> 00:17:33,831
effect.
Every,

279
00:17:33,831 --> 00:17:38,450
everyone has a different sort of dreaming
style and at the highest levels they

280
00:17:38,451 --> 00:17:43,130
tend to be abstract slash impressionistic
where the algorithm is just starting

281
00:17:43,131 --> 00:17:48,131
to look at lines and edges and at the
lowest levels it becomes more literal and

282
00:17:50,851 --> 00:17:55,851
even animalistic because the AI is now
manipulating my image more deeply and its

283
00:17:56,971 --> 00:18:01,971
quest to find the things that's been
trained to recognize things like animals

284
00:18:03,030 --> 00:18:04,590
and objects and buildings.

285
00:18:05,880 --> 00:18:08,700
Then there are four sub
parameters like number of octaves,

286
00:18:08,701 --> 00:18:11,010
octave scale factor and so on,

287
00:18:11,011 --> 00:18:15,420
which allowed me to fine
tune the intensity and scale
of the dreaming features.

288
00:18:16,110 --> 00:18:18,070
So when I find it promising mix,
uh,

289
00:18:18,150 --> 00:18:22,170
I commit to the full resolution version.
Uh,

290
00:18:22,230 --> 00:18:26,550
and these typically take anywhere
from six to 20 hours of computing,

291
00:18:26,551 --> 00:18:28,290
depending upon the size of the image.

292
00:18:28,870 --> 00:18:33,630
The guys were kind enough to provide me
with this progress bar to keep track of

293
00:18:33,631 --> 00:18:37,920
that. I try real hard not to press
that button there, cancel dream.

294
00:18:38,660 --> 00:18:42,810
Um, but eventually I ended up with
uh, the full resolution thing.

295
00:18:43,290 --> 00:18:44,340
Several hours later,

296
00:18:45,540 --> 00:18:50,540
Chris lamb calculated that a typical 10
hour job probably performs about 150,

297
00:18:51,121 --> 00:18:55,260
quadrillion floating point math
operations just to manipulate one image.

298
00:18:55,620 --> 00:18:58,080
So it's working hard
usually while I'm sleeping.

299
00:19:00,410 --> 00:19:01,970
So when we first started to get results,

300
00:19:02,030 --> 00:19:05,680
I was delighted to see the following
happen. I suspect that it would,

301
00:19:05,690 --> 00:19:09,830
but I wasn't totally sure this,
this thing I call the museum experience.

302
00:19:10,370 --> 00:19:14,390
So have you guys noticed when you go like
to the met into the landscape painting

303
00:19:14,391 --> 00:19:19,391
galleries that you walk in and on the
opposite wall you may see some large

304
00:19:19,881 --> 00:19:23,120
sumptuous, almost photographic
landscape, but when you get close up,

305
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:27,050
you see all these brushstrokes and
expressiveness and perhaps some hidden

306
00:19:27,051 --> 00:19:28,160
details,
right?

307
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:32,450
It's like having two different experiences
this far versus near dichotomy.

308
00:19:33,770 --> 00:19:36,290
So besides the expressiveness,

309
00:19:36,350 --> 00:19:39,080
that deep dream lent to my
work when I saw the results,

310
00:19:39,081 --> 00:19:43,550
another thing that excited me was to
participate in another art tradition of

311
00:19:43,730 --> 00:19:46,520
camouflage and dual meaning,
um,

312
00:19:46,550 --> 00:19:50,000
such as you find in the works of art
and Boldo back in the renaissance who

313
00:19:50,001 --> 00:19:54,440
painted portraits composed entirely
of fruits, vegetables, flowers,

314
00:19:54,441 --> 00:19:58,220
et cetera. And in the late 18
hundreds and early 19 hundreds,

315
00:19:58,221 --> 00:20:02,630
Abbott Thayer whose interest in protective
coloration in nature ultimately led

316
00:20:02,631 --> 00:20:06,560
to the use of military camouflage and
World War One little side note about that.

317
00:20:07,880 --> 00:20:08,391
And of course,

318
00:20:08,391 --> 00:20:12,410
the Great Salvador Dali whose works
are filled with illusion and multiple

319
00:20:12,411 --> 00:20:13,244
meetings.

320
00:20:15,230 --> 00:20:16,063
So

321
00:20:16,500 --> 00:20:21,480
this then brings us to
presenting dreamscapes with
this kind of detail in the

322
00:20:21,481 --> 00:20:25,620
digital realm.
These images are essentially in prison.

323
00:20:26,250 --> 00:20:30,810
Yes, you can zoom into them online,
but the more you zoom into the image,

324
00:20:30,840 --> 00:20:31,950
the less of it you see.

325
00:20:31,980 --> 00:20:36,480
This can be a very frustrating
experience and I can tell you,

326
00:20:36,510 --> 00:20:38,430
and hopefully if you haven't already seen,

327
00:20:38,460 --> 00:20:42,960
you will notice that
something fundamentally better
happens when you can walk

328
00:20:42,961 --> 00:20:44,700
right up to a scene like this,

329
00:20:44,760 --> 00:20:49,760
see all the crazy details and hold the
entirety of the image in your periphery.

330
00:20:51,490 --> 00:20:55,480
That's one reason why I chose this large
format medium, and as I said earlier,

331
00:20:55,481 --> 00:20:56,770
I'm all about back lighting.

332
00:20:57,370 --> 00:21:00,910
And the last thing I should point out
is that the rich parameter space of deep

333
00:21:00,911 --> 00:21:05,650
dream enables me to commit to
digital originals, meaning I never,

334
00:21:05,710 --> 00:21:08,710
I can get away with never printing
the same exact image twice.

335
00:21:09,040 --> 00:21:13,840
So another option for viewing dreamscapes
is with large video walls. Actually,

336
00:21:13,841 --> 00:21:18,580
the first opportunity Joseph and I ever
had to see our dream scapes at scale was

337
00:21:18,670 --> 00:21:22,930
down at the Qualcomm institute and Uc
San Diego on the vroom display as it's

338
00:21:22,931 --> 00:21:25,210
called.
This was a really fun day,

339
00:21:25,211 --> 00:21:30,211
especially after months of looking at
these images like with blinders on through

340
00:21:31,121 --> 00:21:35,940
the limited window of a computer
monitor. Um, so it was thrilling. Um,

341
00:21:36,190 --> 00:21:40,360
but I have to say even at 66 megapixels,

342
00:21:40,390 --> 00:21:43,090
which is a lot for video,
a display,

343
00:21:43,091 --> 00:21:47,440
this powerful could only deliver a
fraction of the pixels in our dreamscapes,

344
00:21:47,530 --> 00:21:49,660
some of which are over 400 megapixels.

345
00:21:50,650 --> 00:21:54,550
A lot of people ask me about viewing
dreamscapes in virtual reality.

346
00:21:55,240 --> 00:21:57,970
I've had the good fortune of doing that
in a couple of different VR research

347
00:21:57,971 --> 00:21:59,230
labs,
including yours.

348
00:22:00,070 --> 00:22:03,460
And one thing that they all had to
solve was how to deliver the pixels

349
00:22:03,461 --> 00:22:08,461
efficiently so that the system is
only displaying full resolution.

350
00:22:10,390 --> 00:22:13,000
Depending upon where you're looking at,
how much you're zoomed in,

351
00:22:13,960 --> 00:22:17,650
not hard to solve. It's been that that
problem has been solved for a long time.

352
00:22:17,651 --> 00:22:20,680
It's basically is exactly
how Google Earth Vr works.

353
00:22:21,190 --> 00:22:25,510
As you're navigating the planet, you
know, flying through the Swiss Alps,

354
00:22:25,511 --> 00:22:29,440
you're really just flying through
a very large image dataset.

355
00:22:30,790 --> 00:22:34,090
So personal. I'm very excited about,
uh, viewing dreamscapes and VR.

356
00:22:34,091 --> 00:22:38,020
I've had the experience now in a number
of places and it's totally thrilling.

357
00:22:38,021 --> 00:22:40,990
It's, it's, it's amazing
how immersive, uh, in fact,

358
00:22:41,140 --> 00:22:44,620
just yesterday uptown,
I got to see this. Uh,

359
00:22:44,621 --> 00:22:49,621
it's amazing how immersive this experience
is even though these images are only

360
00:22:49,721 --> 00:22:52,810
two dimensional and,
and there's some great applications,

361
00:22:52,811 --> 00:22:57,580
especially for this content given
the it's basis in healing art,

362
00:22:58,050 --> 00:22:58,270
uh,

363
00:22:58,270 --> 00:23:03,270
for things like Stress
Reduction and distraction
therapy for pain management and

364
00:23:03,341 --> 00:23:04,174
things like that.

365
00:23:05,770 --> 00:23:09,010
So just a quick stop observation I want
to make about all this and maybe about

366
00:23:09,011 --> 00:23:13,270
technology in general, um, referring
to this sort of saw tooth curve here.

367
00:23:14,650 --> 00:23:18,430
When you look at the different
technologies and methods for capturing and

368
00:23:18,431 --> 00:23:21,380
conveying the power of a special place,
uh,

369
00:23:21,381 --> 00:23:24,100
you'll find that each time
a paradigm shift occurs,

370
00:23:24,160 --> 00:23:28,420
like the transition from landscape
painting to photography or from landscape

371
00:23:28,421 --> 00:23:33,370
photography to Vr, there's a lot
of initial excitement and anxiety.

372
00:23:33,400 --> 00:23:36,340
I mean, I, I think, think about it
and the, in the early 18 hundreds,

373
00:23:36,790 --> 00:23:41,790
mid 1800 so when the landscape
painters were at the top of their game,

374
00:23:42,371 --> 00:23:46,700
how do you think they felt when a device
comes along that can capture the actual

375
00:23:46,701 --> 00:23:49,970
photons in the scene? Um, you know,

376
00:23:49,971 --> 00:23:53,870
but the truth is it was a big
step down and quality and impact.

377
00:23:53,890 --> 00:23:58,370
At first you couldn't make color,
you couldn't make huge prints,

378
00:23:58,371 --> 00:24:02,450
the resolution wasn't there and so on,
but it's steadily improved.

379
00:24:02,840 --> 00:24:06,950
And you had folks like Ansell
Adams producing majestic
black and white images in

380
00:24:06,951 --> 00:24:11,660
the first half of the 20th century
and in the mid 19 hundreds,

381
00:24:11,661 --> 00:24:16,010
Eliot porter who's intimate landscapes
did much to boost the acceptance of color

382
00:24:16,011 --> 00:24:18,080
photography as an artistic medium.

383
00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:19,680
Okay.

384
00:24:19,680 --> 00:24:24,300
And in the late 20th century,
Peter Lik using panoramic
film cameras, um, you know,

385
00:24:24,301 --> 00:24:26,580
to create works that at
least in some respects,

386
00:24:27,450 --> 00:24:31,080
surpass those of the
representational landscape painters.

387
00:24:32,190 --> 00:24:32,670
Okay.

388
00:24:32,670 --> 00:24:36,120
So, well, I think a similar
thing is happening right
now. They're there, you know,

389
00:24:36,121 --> 00:24:39,240
with the advent of virtual reality.
Again, a lot of excitement,

390
00:24:39,540 --> 00:24:44,540
but a bit of a step down in quality and
impact with lots of room for improvement

391
00:24:45,120 --> 00:24:48,180
and many problems to solve.
But that will happen.

392
00:24:48,240 --> 00:24:52,410
And I for 1:00 AM not threatened by this.
I quite the opposite.

393
00:24:52,411 --> 00:24:57,411
I'm excited to work with the our labs
and startups to help make that happen.

394
00:24:59,710 --> 00:25:01,540
So back to dreamscapes just for fun,

395
00:25:02,230 --> 00:25:06,700
I'd like to pause here and show you a
short video designed to illustrate the

396
00:25:06,701 --> 00:25:07,534
variety,

397
00:25:07,710 --> 00:25:12,040
the zooming power and the surprising
details within our dream scapes.

398
00:29:26,960 --> 00:29:31,960
[inaudible]

399
00:29:50,740 --> 00:29:51,670
all right.

400
00:29:52,720 --> 00:29:57,720
So I'd like to end by coming back to my
original aspirations when I originally

401
00:29:58,421 --> 00:30:02,980
set out to do and I hope I've been able
to achieve with the help of my ingenious

402
00:30:02,981 --> 00:30:07,480
engineering collaborators, Joseph
Smart and Chris Lamb. And the,

403
00:30:07,570 --> 00:30:12,520
of course tireless efforts of my new best
friend deep dream is to share with you

404
00:30:12,521 --> 00:30:14,500
my experiences of special places.

405
00:30:15,010 --> 00:30:19,270
I want it to project their power and
beauty through your eyes in such a way

406
00:30:21,220 --> 00:30:22,900
that you feel it deeply in your body

407
00:30:24,900 --> 00:30:26,640
and it engages your mind.

408
00:30:28,400 --> 00:30:33,400
And as I reflect on this project and I
realized that by teaming up with an AI is

409
00:30:33,841 --> 00:30:38,841
taking me beyond my initial ambitions
in that it's essentially unlocked a

410
00:30:39,631 --> 00:30:44,250
superpower for me. I could never
execute these images solely on my own,

411
00:30:45,600 --> 00:30:50,130
but it has required me giving up a degree
of control and that I can't tell it

412
00:30:50,131 --> 00:30:52,680
exactly what to do.
And in fact,

413
00:30:52,710 --> 00:30:56,190
I don't even fully understand how
or why it's doing what it's doing.

414
00:30:57,990 --> 00:30:59,070
But as far as I know,

415
00:30:59,100 --> 00:31:04,100
the AI has no innate desire to create
art nor any ability to discern which of

416
00:31:06,271 --> 00:31:10,800
the parameter settings are most
aesthetically pleasing to humans.

417
00:31:11,580 --> 00:31:12,600
I say as far as I know,

418
00:31:12,601 --> 00:31:16,680
because Steve Jurvetson recently pointed
out that a sufficiently advanced AI

419
00:31:17,070 --> 00:31:21,210
would choose to fail the Turing test.
Let's help Steve is wrong,

420
00:31:21,720 --> 00:31:24,600
and that my AI is indeed just a tool.

421
00:31:26,040 --> 00:31:29,670
I'll be at an incredibly
powerful tool, one that, uh,

422
00:31:29,970 --> 00:31:31,890
might be somewhat beyond
our comprehension.

423
00:31:32,610 --> 00:31:36,270
But ultimately I still make the decisions
as to how to steer it and what to keep

424
00:31:36,330 --> 00:31:39,420
or discard.
I imagine the future of art,

425
00:31:39,421 --> 00:31:42,060
science and technology will
be increasingly like this.

426
00:31:42,720 --> 00:31:45,300
Where we use ais to process more data,

427
00:31:45,840 --> 00:31:50,610
see more complicated patterns and
otherwise extend our natural capabilities,

428
00:31:50,611 --> 00:31:53,190
but working towards goals
that we sat and direct.

429
00:31:53,880 --> 00:31:58,320
I hope that my dream scapes project serves
as a clear example is that artificial

430
00:31:58,321 --> 00:32:03,321
intelligence can enhance not only
our abilities and our productivity,

431
00:32:04,260 --> 00:32:07,350
but even our creativity.
Thank you.

432
00:32:14,450 --> 00:32:15,950
With that,
I'm going to introduce Joseph.

433
00:32:15,951 --> 00:32:18,730
He's going to give a little talk
about the tech behind the art. Um,

434
00:32:19,610 --> 00:32:22,910
and then we'll open it up to Q and
a with as much time as we have left.

435
00:32:23,060 --> 00:32:27,980
Thanks a lot. Yeah, thanks
Dan. That was great. Um, yeah,
there's so much going on. Uh,

436
00:32:28,100 --> 00:32:32,270
you know, he sort of roped me into
this a little while back and I thought,

437
00:32:33,200 --> 00:32:35,960
how hard could this be? This will be fun.
You know, I'm, I'm a scrappy engineer.

438
00:32:35,961 --> 00:32:38,360
Let's just see what we can
do. And then I was like, oh,

439
00:32:38,361 --> 00:32:40,520
actually I have no what I'm doing.
Uh,

440
00:32:40,521 --> 00:32:44,570
and so I share this because ultimately
obviously we were able to make it work.

441
00:32:44,571 --> 00:32:48,080
And I think that's kind of an empowering
reminder that a lot of our sort of

442
00:32:48,081 --> 00:32:51,920
basic skills as engineers in terms of
just trying things out and being willing

443
00:32:51,921 --> 00:32:55,040
to iterate and asking for help and so
forth can get you surprisingly far. And I,

444
00:32:55,100 --> 00:32:55,341
you know,

445
00:32:55,341 --> 00:32:59,480
it's been surprisingly moving from me
to see how much has happened as a result

446
00:32:59,481 --> 00:33:00,410
of this collaboration,
right?

447
00:33:00,411 --> 00:33:03,830
This went way beyond just the fun
of problem solving and it's, uh,

448
00:33:03,831 --> 00:33:07,430
it's made me kind of appreciate that I
don't have to just work on utility all

449
00:33:07,430 --> 00:33:07,431
day,

450
00:33:07,431 --> 00:33:12,080
that actually helping a expression as
it can be just as deeply moving in terms

451
00:33:12,081 --> 00:33:16,370
of how we got there. So the, when
Dan sent me these low Rez thumbnails,

452
00:33:16,400 --> 00:33:19,820
I forwarded them on the internal Google
plus and said, hey, aren't these cool?

453
00:33:20,060 --> 00:33:22,280
You know, we were talking about scaling
them up. What are you think we need to do?

454
00:33:22,580 --> 00:33:24,940
And, uh, some people, a bunch of
people inside the company, Solomon,

455
00:33:24,970 --> 00:33:27,950
including some of the people on the
deep Dream Team and they said, yeah,

456
00:33:27,951 --> 00:33:29,660
we've had some similar ideas.
You know,

457
00:33:29,661 --> 00:33:31,970
you're going to have to do some sort
of a breaking it up into tiling.

458
00:33:31,970 --> 00:33:36,170
Here's some original, some ideas to get
started and so forth. Um, and you know,

459
00:33:36,171 --> 00:33:40,760
obviously you can't just take an entire
image, scale it down to the size,

460
00:33:40,761 --> 00:33:41,001
you know,
the,

461
00:33:41,001 --> 00:33:43,820
the actual networks work on image
is only a few hundred pixels wide.

462
00:33:43,821 --> 00:33:46,880
So if you do that and dream it and scale
it back up, you lose all the details.

463
00:33:47,150 --> 00:33:49,910
But if you just naively chopped the
image up into tiles and dream each child

464
00:33:49,911 --> 00:33:52,910
separately, you get weird seems
between them. So you can't do that.

465
00:33:53,240 --> 00:33:57,890
And so it turns out to work best is
to break the image down into tiles,

466
00:33:57,891 --> 00:33:59,240
but instead of actually
chopping the image,

467
00:33:59,241 --> 00:34:01,850
you just sort of slide a window around
the image and you, you know, in,

468
00:34:02,210 --> 00:34:04,050
in the sort of the RGB matrix,
you,

469
00:34:04,051 --> 00:34:07,100
you wrap the ends around so you can
kind of slide off the ends and you do a

470
00:34:07,101 --> 00:34:11,000
random offset and jitter every time
you dream so that they don't line up

471
00:34:11,001 --> 00:34:13,850
perfectly. And You keep doing
that for multiple iterations.

472
00:34:13,851 --> 00:34:16,640
And you also sort of scale the image
up and down a bit as you're doing it.

473
00:34:16,820 --> 00:34:20,180
And you can keep doing that for a while
because it's dreaming on its own output.

474
00:34:20,390 --> 00:34:22,850
All the lines kind of disappeared and
it ends up being kind of one coherent

475
00:34:22,851 --> 00:34:23,510
image.

476
00:34:23,510 --> 00:34:26,000
And it also gives you these parameters
that Dan mentioned that I'll let you kind

477
00:34:26,001 --> 00:34:27,710
of control the feature size and the,

478
00:34:27,711 --> 00:34:30,950
and the intensity and also of course
the layer name and he's found kind of

479
00:34:30,951 --> 00:34:33,020
different ways of applying
that for different images,

480
00:34:33,021 --> 00:34:35,030
which was kind of a
surprising plus from that.

481
00:34:35,540 --> 00:34:37,880
The other big challenge
is memory management.

482
00:34:37,881 --> 00:34:40,670
And this again is sort of
took me by surprise because
there's sort of two layers

483
00:34:40,671 --> 00:34:44,770
to it. One is the actual
dreaming all happens on the GPS.

484
00:34:45,500 --> 00:34:46,410
And I should say,
by the way,

485
00:34:46,411 --> 00:34:49,340
in apologies to my Google colleagues
that we did this on Amazon cause at the

486
00:34:49,341 --> 00:34:53,480
time the GPU compute instances weren't
available on Google cloud. So that's a,

487
00:34:53,510 --> 00:34:58,160
maybe we should, um, you know,
fix that now anyway. But, uh,

488
00:34:58,190 --> 00:35:02,240
the GPU itself has memory on it and it's
only a fixed amount of memory and so

489
00:35:02,241 --> 00:35:05,390
you can't overload the GPU with
too much pixels or it'll crash.

490
00:35:05,570 --> 00:35:07,190
And so you have to kind
of size the workload.

491
00:35:07,430 --> 00:35:10,580
And then a main memory actually turned
out to be a bigger bottle neck then GPU

492
00:35:10,581 --> 00:35:11,241
memory for us,

493
00:35:11,241 --> 00:35:13,970
which was surprising to me because
even at a few hundred megapixels,

494
00:35:14,210 --> 00:35:17,450
these like the jpegs themselves are only
a few hundred megabytes. So I was like,

495
00:35:17,451 --> 00:35:19,490
how hard can this be?
But I sort of forgotten.

496
00:35:19,491 --> 00:35:23,300
It's obvious in retrospect that when
you're actually doing a dreaming or any

497
00:35:23,301 --> 00:35:24,590
kind of neural network on an image,

498
00:35:24,770 --> 00:35:26,830
you have to fully inflate
it so that you know,

499
00:35:26,870 --> 00:35:30,170
each pixel is a 32 bit r n a g
and a B. Right? So it's sort of,

500
00:35:30,230 --> 00:35:32,820
it's like an order of
magnitude or more memory. Um,

501
00:35:32,870 --> 00:35:35,540
and then these python libraries that are
the sort of the standard ones for doing

502
00:35:35,541 --> 00:35:38,010
scientific computing and,
and image manipulation and so forth,

503
00:35:38,280 --> 00:35:41,550
they ended up making them kind of a lot
of like lazy array copies in the process,

504
00:35:41,760 --> 00:35:45,370
which is normally fine, but when you're
input is several hundred megapixels, um,

505
00:35:45,600 --> 00:35:46,440
it's not so fine.

506
00:35:46,710 --> 00:35:50,100
And so a lot of the work ended up being
a kind of very careful memory profiling

507
00:35:50,101 --> 00:35:52,920
and just sort of stepping through and
figuring out at each step what's going on

508
00:35:53,190 --> 00:35:55,890
and trying to find clever ways to
avoid as many of these memory copies as

509
00:35:55,891 --> 00:35:58,830
possible. Um, and you know,
thank God for open source,

510
00:35:58,831 --> 00:36:01,800
right where a lot of these libraries
that we were using themselves were open

511
00:36:01,801 --> 00:36:04,410
source. And so we could kind of go as
far under the hood as we needed to.

512
00:36:04,590 --> 00:36:08,820
And eventually we actually got it
working. Um, and it's, you know,

513
00:36:08,821 --> 00:36:09,690
what's cool too is,
I mean,

514
00:36:09,691 --> 00:36:11,550
this was kind of a night and
weekend project is sort of,

515
00:36:11,790 --> 00:36:12,870
could barely get it work.
And I'm,

516
00:36:12,871 --> 00:36:14,580
you know how it is when you
first get your code running,

517
00:36:14,820 --> 00:36:17,040
you're kind of scared to touch it because
you think you breathed on it wrong,

518
00:36:17,041 --> 00:36:18,450
it's going to fall over.
Um,

519
00:36:18,810 --> 00:36:22,410
but we handed it off to Dan and he spent
a week going crazy trying all these

520
00:36:22,411 --> 00:36:24,900
experiments and it actually held up
pretty well. And so I guess, you know,

521
00:36:25,210 --> 00:36:28,170
you don't have to set your bar at
something that is completely industrial

522
00:36:28,171 --> 00:36:30,840
strength, right? Just be able to get
a tool that somebody can play with.

523
00:36:30,870 --> 00:36:31,341
I think it's,

524
00:36:31,341 --> 00:36:34,250
it's sort of surprising sometimes how
far you can take that and you know,

525
00:36:34,260 --> 00:36:35,011
but it was python.

526
00:36:35,011 --> 00:36:38,820
So we just put a very simple like Django
web Ui in front of it and we put all

527
00:36:38,821 --> 00:36:41,910
the dreaming tasks behind a celery queue
so that you could get the progress bar

528
00:36:41,911 --> 00:36:43,920
and you didn't have to wait 10
hours for your page to load,

529
00:36:44,160 --> 00:36:46,950
but that was about it. Um, and then
the rest kind of took care of itself.

530
00:36:47,310 --> 00:36:50,200
And you know, we've made a few little
tweaks along the way, but, uh, I,

531
00:36:50,320 --> 00:36:53,220
I would just say it's, this is something
that I have got no formal training in.

532
00:36:53,280 --> 00:36:56,400
Um, but it was a really exciting thing
to do and I'm sure you might find other

533
00:36:56,401 --> 00:36:58,110
opportunities to do things
like that in the future.

534
00:36:58,111 --> 00:37:00,720
Maybe not with deep dreaming per se,
but things like that.

535
00:37:00,721 --> 00:37:03,660
So I definitely encourage you
to do that. Um, let's see.

536
00:37:03,661 --> 00:37:04,710
Other things that are worth talking about.

537
00:37:04,711 --> 00:37:07,230
I guess maybe let me just give you a
quick, for those of you haven't seen it,

538
00:37:07,260 --> 00:37:10,950
a little explanation because people often
ask about why deep dream creates these

539
00:37:10,951 --> 00:37:12,740
hallucinations in the first place.
And then we'll,

540
00:37:12,810 --> 00:37:14,310
I'll bring back then up for
the rest of the Q and a.

541
00:37:14,820 --> 00:37:19,290
So remember that what the way these
networks work is you feed an image in,

542
00:37:19,320 --> 00:37:21,120
and this is like Google
photos or Google Lens.

543
00:37:21,120 --> 00:37:23,100
One of these things you're trying
to figure out, is there a dog in it?

544
00:37:23,101 --> 00:37:25,810
Is there a building in it? What have
you? And so the way it works is the,

545
00:37:25,820 --> 00:37:29,100
the pixels come in at the bottom and
then you have a series of layers in the

546
00:37:29,101 --> 00:37:29,670
neural network.

547
00:37:29,670 --> 00:37:33,600
And each layer is trying to basically
learn statistical patterns of the output

548
00:37:33,601 --> 00:37:37,110
of the previous layer. The first layer
starts to look for patterns of Pixels,

549
00:37:37,111 --> 00:37:40,200
which might be a little like lines
or blocks of color or shapes.

550
00:37:40,590 --> 00:37:43,620
And then the next layer we'll look for
patterns of those patterns and so forth,

551
00:37:43,621 --> 00:37:43,771
right?

552
00:37:43,771 --> 00:37:46,590
And so you get higher and higher level
concepts all the way up to eyes and faces

553
00:37:46,591 --> 00:37:49,200
and so forth at the top.
And of course in the middle,

554
00:37:49,320 --> 00:37:50,670
all of these layers that you've trained,

555
00:37:50,671 --> 00:37:53,010
you've given lots of images where
you've told it what's in there. Um,

556
00:37:53,100 --> 00:37:56,310
they've just learned these weight matrices
and that have optimized the target

557
00:37:56,311 --> 00:37:59,400
function, but it's completely
opaque to you as a, as an engineer,

558
00:37:59,401 --> 00:38:02,040
you have no idea why it did what it did.
And so when it gets something wrong,

559
00:38:02,280 --> 00:38:06,300
you want to figure out, well, like why
did it misclassify this image? Um, you,

560
00:38:06,301 --> 00:38:08,970
you sort of don't know what to change.
And so the deep Dream Team,

561
00:38:08,971 --> 00:38:12,420
what they were trying to do was gain some
intuition for what these intermediate

562
00:38:12,421 --> 00:38:13,680
layers had actually learned.

563
00:38:14,010 --> 00:38:16,500
And so they have this very simple but
very clever idea for how to do it,

564
00:38:16,501 --> 00:38:20,430
which is you run forward propagation in
the network up to the some middle layer

565
00:38:20,431 --> 00:38:22,020
that you choose so that it's not,

566
00:38:22,120 --> 00:38:24,960
it hasn't fully recognize the object but
it has some sort of patterns learned.

567
00:38:25,470 --> 00:38:26,580
And then you say,

568
00:38:26,581 --> 00:38:29,970
well how could I instead of normally know
when you're training a neural network,

569
00:38:29,971 --> 00:38:30,450
you say,

570
00:38:30,450 --> 00:38:33,990
how can I change the weights to do a
little bit better at recognize the image

571
00:38:34,170 --> 00:38:35,560
here you do the exact opposite.
You say,

572
00:38:35,561 --> 00:38:38,290
how can I change the image a little bit
to have the weights have done a better

573
00:38:38,291 --> 00:38:40,210
job of recognizing whatever
it was recognizing.

574
00:38:40,570 --> 00:38:43,960
Because remember that the image too is
just a ends up being just a matrix of

575
00:38:43,961 --> 00:38:46,090
floats and so you can
essentially do gradient space,

576
00:38:46,330 --> 00:38:49,030
gradient descent in Pixel space with
respect to the weights as opposed to

577
00:38:49,060 --> 00:38:51,530
normally where you do gradient descent in,
you know,

578
00:38:51,600 --> 00:38:54,100
wait space with respect to the pixels.
And that's all it does.

579
00:38:54,101 --> 00:38:56,890
And then you just read that image
back out. And so it's kind of like,

580
00:38:56,920 --> 00:39:00,400
I think about it like if you're staring
at a cloud and you sort of like see like

581
00:39:00,430 --> 00:39:01,540
it looks like a horse or something.

582
00:39:01,541 --> 00:39:02,840
And if you'd like to
think really hard to keep,

583
00:39:02,870 --> 00:39:04,420
like make it look leaving a
little bit more like a horse,

584
00:39:04,630 --> 00:39:06,180
that's essentially what you're doing.
Um,

585
00:39:06,270 --> 00:39:09,630
and then what popped out
where all of these surprising
details. Um, and you know,

586
00:39:09,640 --> 00:39:11,470
so that's why you see this,
you know,

587
00:39:11,500 --> 00:39:13,690
this is the normal inception network
that we use in Google photos.

588
00:39:13,691 --> 00:39:17,100
So it sees dogs and faces and buildings
and the things that we trained to

589
00:39:17,110 --> 00:39:19,600
recognize. But you can train a network
on a different set of images and it would

590
00:39:19,900 --> 00:39:21,970
hallucinate totally different
things in the image. And of course,

591
00:39:21,971 --> 00:39:25,290
depending on the layer, it hallucinates
more or less than distract things. Um,

592
00:39:25,390 --> 00:39:27,340
and they actually did find under,
if you've seen any of this,

593
00:39:27,341 --> 00:39:30,940
they found some cool things in
the process. Um, like I guess the,

594
00:39:31,180 --> 00:39:33,230
whenever they were trying
to learn a hammer, uh,

595
00:39:33,280 --> 00:39:36,070
the image that came out of
the hallucination always
had an arm attached to it

596
00:39:36,550 --> 00:39:38,800
and they had to go back and realize
it and all their training data,

597
00:39:38,801 --> 00:39:41,170
they never gave it a picture of just
like a hammer lying on the table.

598
00:39:41,410 --> 00:39:43,100
And so the image had, you
know, had always learned it.

599
00:39:43,101 --> 00:39:44,810
So it's things like that you
wouldn't have otherwise realized.

600
00:39:44,811 --> 00:39:46,780
And it actually ended up helping
with some of the training weights,

601
00:39:47,020 --> 00:39:49,120
but it had this sort of
totally unexpected side effect.

602
00:39:49,121 --> 00:39:50,920
And for those of you who are
around, you'll remember that. Um,

603
00:39:51,370 --> 00:39:54,570
there was some posts on I think
internal gps as well of uh, the,

604
00:39:54,580 --> 00:39:58,000
the deep dream team being like, here's
some weird images that have, uh, um,

605
00:39:58,210 --> 00:40:01,120
you know, that, that we got
as a side effect of doing
this, this diagnostic work.

606
00:40:01,330 --> 00:40:03,730
And of course Google is being Googlers
and all the source code being opened

607
00:40:03,731 --> 00:40:04,091
internally,

608
00:40:04,091 --> 00:40:06,580
they like grabbed it and started doing
it on their family photos and you know,

609
00:40:06,581 --> 00:40:10,000
it sort of went viral internally and
that then prompted them to make an open

610
00:40:10,001 --> 00:40:12,970
source version that led to all those
lovely pictures of the Dan showed you of

611
00:40:12,971 --> 00:40:15,030
the Internet going crazy with deep dream.
Um,

612
00:40:15,040 --> 00:40:17,100
so it's just kind of an
amazing progression, right? Uh,

613
00:40:17,110 --> 00:40:20,650
to go from something that was really just
a tool scratching an itch to something

614
00:40:20,651 --> 00:40:22,000
that's had this kind of
transformational power.

615
00:40:22,001 --> 00:40:24,190
So I just wanted to share that anecdote
because I think there's gonna be lots

616
00:40:24,191 --> 00:40:28,120
more opportunities for us all to do things
like that. Um, let me stop right there.

617
00:40:28,121 --> 00:40:29,660
We still have about 10
minutes for questions. Uh,

618
00:40:29,980 --> 00:40:32,890
come to the mic if you've got one so we
can capture it for the video and then

619
00:40:32,891 --> 00:40:35,230
please feel free to stick
around afterwards for the
reception and we can chat

620
00:40:35,231 --> 00:40:36,400
more.
So thanks very much guys.

621
00:40:37,310 --> 00:40:38,143
Thank you.

622
00:40:43,170 --> 00:40:44,760
Questions?
Who's got one?

623
00:40:46,630 --> 00:40:48,610
I know you haven't physically
get it also clears yet.

624
00:40:48,670 --> 00:40:49,990
Microphone closer to the mic please.

625
00:40:53,060 --> 00:40:53,271
All right.

626
00:40:53,271 --> 00:40:57,170
Well I love the fact that you gave that
whole art history progression because it

627
00:40:57,171 --> 00:41:01,160
fits so well into their thank you.
And I particularly like the way,

628
00:41:01,161 --> 00:41:04,340
if you look at like say saison and Monet,

629
00:41:04,341 --> 00:41:08,450
the way that the artists take the
brushstrokes and manipulate them.

630
00:41:08,451 --> 00:41:10,280
So even though they're not very realistic,

631
00:41:10,760 --> 00:41:14,780
they really convey a different emotion
than you would if you had something very

632
00:41:14,781 --> 00:41:16,820
realistic.
So I love that.

633
00:41:16,821 --> 00:41:20,810
But the other question I had was
about the images once you or the,

634
00:41:21,170 --> 00:41:24,440
the Ai images in the,
in the photographs,

635
00:41:25,250 --> 00:41:29,360
did you pick and choose like multiple,
um,

636
00:41:29,420 --> 00:41:32,900
you got different results? Did you
kind of incorporate something that was

637
00:41:34,250 --> 00:41:38,570
like more important to you in
emotionally then than other images?

638
00:41:38,571 --> 00:41:42,230
And how many times do you have to run
through that and what's cause that's

639
00:41:42,231 --> 00:41:46,510
totally different than what artists
have done. So I found that really Greg,

640
00:41:46,650 --> 00:41:47,420
great question.

641
00:41:47,420 --> 00:41:51,740
So for sure given 84 different layers,

642
00:41:51,980 --> 00:41:53,720
I want to have some ideas
of what I want to do,

643
00:41:53,721 --> 00:41:57,950
at least in terms of do I
want this image to be cooked,

644
00:41:58,400 --> 00:42:01,220
raw, medium or well
done? Meaning, you know,

645
00:42:01,280 --> 00:42:03,920
sort of more abstract or more animalistic.

646
00:42:04,400 --> 00:42:08,030
I tend to prefer the more impressionistic,

647
00:42:08,360 --> 00:42:11,630
but there are times where it makes
sense to do it very animalistic,

648
00:42:11,720 --> 00:42:16,040
like the wooded scene that has
all the creatures in it. You know,

649
00:42:16,550 --> 00:42:18,260
the woods we know are alive,

650
00:42:18,410 --> 00:42:22,310
but you walk through a peaceful grove
and Ma might hear a few birds chirping.

651
00:42:22,311 --> 00:42:24,020
But other than that,
it seems really still.

652
00:42:24,560 --> 00:42:29,560
But we intellectually know that there
are thousands of species all around us

653
00:42:30,050 --> 00:42:33,590
that we just don't see. So in that case,
it really made sense to go that way.

654
00:42:33,860 --> 00:42:38,150
Now there's a whole bunch of layers that
create different sort of animalistic

655
00:42:38,151 --> 00:42:41,570
effects and to some people,

656
00:42:41,840 --> 00:42:46,250
all of those are a little bit creepy,
but some are really creepy. And so, yeah,

657
00:42:46,251 --> 00:42:49,990
I have to experiment. Conversely,
on the impression aside, um,

658
00:42:50,240 --> 00:42:52,060
I had a canyon seen that,
um,

659
00:42:52,690 --> 00:42:56,840
got printed for a couple of art fairs
in Miami and, uh, down in Florida.

660
00:42:58,820 --> 00:43:03,820
And I really wanted to find a look as
if the native Americans had carved every

661
00:43:05,421 --> 00:43:09,260
square inch of the canyon with
sort of a petroglyph kind of look.

662
00:43:09,770 --> 00:43:12,110
And I found one,
it took some experimentation.

663
00:43:12,350 --> 00:43:15,870
So typically when I say I'm
doing four at a time, um,

664
00:43:15,950 --> 00:43:20,180
experiments on low rez previous,
I'll do like six of those sets,

665
00:43:20,181 --> 00:43:24,980
all ended up doing like two dozen
attempts now because I'm working on a low

666
00:43:24,981 --> 00:43:29,390
resolution previews, it hints at what
the final thing is going to look like.

667
00:43:29,570 --> 00:43:33,920
It's not a guarantee that I will
have picked the right one. Um,

668
00:43:34,310 --> 00:43:38,420
I would say I've gotten good enough at
it now so that when I finally do commit

669
00:43:38,421 --> 00:43:43,040
to the large resolution job and I do pay
for time on the computer by the minute,

670
00:43:43,190 --> 00:43:46,800
by the hour and minute, whatever.
Um, so I don't want to, you know,

671
00:43:46,820 --> 00:43:49,790
I gotta be kind of judicious
about that to some degree,

672
00:43:50,300 --> 00:43:55,100
but I usually end up getting what I
want on the first shot by that point.

673
00:43:55,310 --> 00:43:56,180
But not always.

674
00:43:56,270 --> 00:44:00,350
Sometimes I have to do the full resolution
of few times to get what I really

675
00:44:00,351 --> 00:44:04,670
want. But especially when it comes to the
intensity and the scale of the feature,

676
00:44:04,680 --> 00:44:06,260
sometimes I've got to
really tweak with that.

677
00:44:07,050 --> 00:44:08,120
I was just thinking that, you know, I,

678
00:44:08,121 --> 00:44:11,120
I did the simplest possible thing
of expose all the parameters and Ui.

679
00:44:11,121 --> 00:44:13,190
That's like when you know, you know, you
don't really understand your user needs,

680
00:44:13,191 --> 00:44:14,600
you just sort of give
them all the controls.

681
00:44:14,840 --> 00:44:16,520
And normally that's not a good
idea as an engineer, right?

682
00:44:16,521 --> 00:44:17,870
If you're building a
really usable product.

683
00:44:17,871 --> 00:44:21,530
But it allowed Dan to do a lot more
matching of the style to the picture,

684
00:44:21,531 --> 00:44:24,550
then I would have originally thought
possible. And one that I love is, uh,

685
00:44:24,800 --> 00:44:29,150
he also got commissioned to build a piece
for a startup in Guadalajara, Mexico.

686
00:44:29,330 --> 00:44:30,890
And so while we were there,
we went to,

687
00:44:30,930 --> 00:44:33,990
there's this amazing old cathedral and
the senator of Guadalajara and he took

688
00:44:33,991 --> 00:44:37,020
this interior, I think maybe we should
have one of the videos. And he did this,

689
00:44:37,290 --> 00:44:38,190
he did this dreaming style,

690
00:44:38,191 --> 00:44:41,730
which it's kind of like spirally and
it looks like you're having a religious

691
00:44:41,731 --> 00:44:44,430
experience and they're so like for me
that like perfectly works with, you know,

692
00:44:44,630 --> 00:44:45,320
yeah.
Subject.

693
00:44:45,320 --> 00:44:49,820
That was a good example because we really
want to be careful not to do anything

694
00:44:49,821 --> 00:44:54,821
that would be offensive to religious
people and conversely hoped to find

695
00:44:56,151 --> 00:45:00,320
something that they would even be inspired
by and felt spiritual or a theorial.

696
00:45:00,470 --> 00:45:05,240
Right. And we found, I think
we found something. Uh, it
took a lot of tries though.

697
00:45:05,470 --> 00:45:10,100
You amazing thing is we were able to
do all of that to completion from our

698
00:45:10,101 --> 00:45:12,170
Western hotel and Guadalajara.
That's right.

699
00:45:12,260 --> 00:45:17,260
Because the robot is up in the cloud and
I could access it within that with any

700
00:45:17,271 --> 00:45:21,470
Internet connection. Yay. Robot
overlords. More questions? We've got a,

701
00:45:21,471 --> 00:45:23,870
we've got five minutes left on
five minutes. Any other questions,

702
00:45:26,720 --> 00:45:30,350
Dan? You wouldn't, you
wouldn't. Joe One's an engineer,

703
00:45:30,351 --> 00:45:35,351
one's a little bit further out than an
engineering and Joe Mixes Joe Mixes or

704
00:45:36,771 --> 00:45:39,290
build something and it comes
up structurally this way.

705
00:45:39,291 --> 00:45:42,020
You're a chemist from
what I'm seeing in your,

706
00:45:42,650 --> 00:45:46,310
you're mixing it together and you're not
sure what happens and what I started up,

707
00:45:46,311 --> 00:45:48,800
you're getting an idea
now when it's coming out.

708
00:45:49,370 --> 00:45:51,080
What's the future you see for these?

709
00:45:51,081 --> 00:45:54,980
You had mentioned something where you
wanted to use it for therapy and what some

710
00:45:54,981 --> 00:45:55,900
of the future you say.

711
00:45:56,010 --> 00:46:00,830
Yeah, so I think there's a couple
parts to that question. Um,

712
00:46:02,220 --> 00:46:05,130
one is where kind of the
workflow goes from here,

713
00:46:05,131 --> 00:46:06,750
where kind of where I can take it next.

714
00:46:07,590 --> 00:46:10,410
And then there's the question
of of how can it be applied.

715
00:46:10,860 --> 00:46:13,740
So in terms of what I'm doing
with it now as an artist,

716
00:46:13,741 --> 00:46:18,741
in terms of trying to push
it is I continue to go on
photo expeditions and look

717
00:46:20,401 --> 00:46:25,401
for special places and capture them and
ideally create full scene dreamscapes.

718
00:46:26,190 --> 00:46:30,810
But in the last year working with a
number of art galleries and some really

719
00:46:31,050 --> 00:46:33,660
astute gallerists and curators.

720
00:46:33,960 --> 00:46:38,520
I've gotten some ideas for really
sort of taken this to a place.

721
00:46:38,880 --> 00:46:40,310
At first I had never even thought of.

722
00:46:40,330 --> 00:46:45,330
In fact when I heard the idea I objected
and realize later that this one curator

723
00:46:46,350 --> 00:46:50,820
was right. Probably helps it. She's Phd
from the Sorbonne and everything else,

724
00:46:50,821 --> 00:46:53,850
but she gave me this idea, she
said, what about what if you took,

725
00:46:54,510 --> 00:46:55,950
you know if this is eight feet high,

726
00:46:55,980 --> 00:47:00,980
what if you took a one foot square
detail right and blew that up to 40 by 40

727
00:47:02,800 --> 00:47:07,560
inches and maybe dreamed on it afresh
with more intensity, what would you get?

728
00:47:07,590 --> 00:47:11,670
It might be a really cool midsize piece
and I gave her all sorts of reasons why

729
00:47:11,671 --> 00:47:15,180
it wasn't possible and that's not what
I do and all this turned out to be the

730
00:47:15,181 --> 00:47:16,270
best thing I ever did it.

731
00:47:17,100 --> 00:47:22,020
I just last week released a new series
called mining nightfall where I took that

732
00:47:22,021 --> 00:47:26,810
central park twilight scene. You might
have noticed in the video and crew and,

733
00:47:26,820 --> 00:47:31,820
and minded for like I ended up with 11
of those scenes and it's a wonderful

734
00:47:33,761 --> 00:47:36,760
fanatic kind of set a,

735
00:47:36,761 --> 00:47:41,410
so that's like where I'm sure there are
more ideas like that that others can

736
00:47:41,411 --> 00:47:46,000
suggest or I can come up with over
time. In terms of the application, um,

737
00:47:46,540 --> 00:47:51,280
again, this does have its
basis in healing. Art,

738
00:47:51,490 --> 00:47:56,260
uh, is not what I initially set out
to do. What I set out to do was to,

739
00:47:56,261 --> 00:47:59,080
I want it to get that
feeling across that I have.

740
00:47:59,080 --> 00:48:02,300
And that feeling happens to be one of
the reason we love to go hiking and going

741
00:48:02,301 --> 00:48:05,130
into nature and stuff like that is
because it makes us feel so good.

742
00:48:05,280 --> 00:48:08,920
That's why they call them restorative
places. It restores us. Um,

743
00:48:09,880 --> 00:48:14,750
and uh, so the application
I'm most excited about is,

744
00:48:14,770 --> 00:48:19,770
is this sort of VR virtual reality
application for stress reduction.

745
00:48:20,380 --> 00:48:25,000
And Like I said,
a distraction therapy for pain management.

746
00:48:25,840 --> 00:48:30,400
Think of burn victims with
this opiate opiate epidemic.

747
00:48:30,430 --> 00:48:34,330
You don't want to be handing out a
lot more painkillers then you need.

748
00:48:35,050 --> 00:48:39,190
And it's known that the brain can only
process so much stuff and if you're

749
00:48:39,191 --> 00:48:42,040
distracted doing something else,
you're not going to feel the pain as much.

750
00:48:42,520 --> 00:48:45,760
So they've actually had good results
experimenting with burn victims,

751
00:48:45,761 --> 00:48:49,150
putting them in a Vr headset and giving
them something really intense to focus

752
00:48:49,151 --> 00:48:54,151
their concentration on and the need
for opiate drugs and painkillers is,

753
00:48:55,840 --> 00:49:00,190
is significantly reduced now in
addition to making it something cool and

754
00:49:00,191 --> 00:49:03,910
interactive, if you also make it something
that's got its basis in healing, art,

755
00:49:05,200 --> 00:49:07,480
you know,
is this is going to be a win win.

756
00:49:08,240 --> 00:49:09,500
And I think more broadly,
the WHO,

757
00:49:09,501 --> 00:49:13,640
there's this idea of collaborating
with AI and having it extend your

758
00:49:13,641 --> 00:49:14,301
capabilities,

759
00:49:14,301 --> 00:49:17,600
but also as sort of a metaphor for the
future of knowledge work where we don't

760
00:49:17,601 --> 00:49:20,450
necessarily have our hands completely
on the controls and we have to kind of

761
00:49:20,451 --> 00:49:23,420
learn how to steer it and work
with it and accept its limitations,

762
00:49:23,421 --> 00:49:25,250
but also let us go further
than we've been before.

763
00:49:25,251 --> 00:49:28,030
And how it helps us think
about the way we see reality.

764
00:49:28,031 --> 00:49:30,920
And I think there's just in,
in music and in video and imagery,

765
00:49:30,921 --> 00:49:32,120
there's so much more opportunity there.

766
00:49:32,121 --> 00:49:34,250
So this definitely convinced me that
we're just scratching the surface.

767
00:49:34,460 --> 00:49:39,110
So we were told to wrap up at four o'clock
in four seconds. We're done. Thank you.

768
00:49:39,111 --> 00:49:39,860
Very.
Thank you very much.
