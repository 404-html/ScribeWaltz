1
00:00:06,060 --> 00:00:10,110
Good afternoon everyone. Uh, today it's
my pleasure to introduce our speaker,

2
00:00:10,111 --> 00:00:11,370
Jared McLean.
Uh,

3
00:00:11,580 --> 00:00:16,110
Jared and I actually did our phd in
the same lab and during Grad School,

4
00:00:16,111 --> 00:00:20,760
Jared was somewhat of a pioneer in
the field of developing algorithms for

5
00:00:20,761 --> 00:00:25,620
quantum computers to simulate
materials and chemistry. In particular,

6
00:00:25,621 --> 00:00:30,270
he's the inventor of one of the most
sort of popular approaches to using near

7
00:00:30,271 --> 00:00:32,010
term quantum computers for this purpose,

8
00:00:32,340 --> 00:00:37,090
which is known as the variational quantum
Eigen solver. Jared is now the, um,

9
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:41,730
Louie c Alvarez fellow at
Lawrence Berkeley national labs.

10
00:00:42,150 --> 00:00:45,240
And lately he's been working
closely with our, uh,

11
00:00:45,300 --> 00:00:49,770
with the [inaudible] AI team at Google
in order to develop software which

12
00:00:49,950 --> 00:00:52,370
compiles chemistry problems,
uh,

13
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:56,130
two instructions that can be run on
near term quantum computers. In fact,

14
00:00:56,131 --> 00:00:59,460
he's a founder of the open
source package from you live,

15
00:00:59,461 --> 00:01:03,750
which we just released earlier this
week. So, uh, without further ado,

16
00:01:03,751 --> 00:01:05,430
I'd like to introduce cheered McLean.

17
00:01:07,410 --> 00:01:08,243
Okay,

18
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:12,180
thanks a lot for the introduction,
Ryan.

19
00:01:12,181 --> 00:01:16,500
And it's my pleasure to be here to talk
a little bit about both what I'd been

20
00:01:16,501 --> 00:01:18,570
doing and quantum computing in general.

21
00:01:18,571 --> 00:01:23,520
So just a few words about kind of the
level of this talk and content of this

22
00:01:23,521 --> 00:01:24,354
talk.
So I,

23
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:28,320
I asked around that is to what level
that these talks are generally given at.

24
00:01:28,321 --> 00:01:30,150
And they told me,
well it might go on youtube,

25
00:01:30,151 --> 00:01:33,840
so it would be useful if at least some
part of it appealed to a more general

26
00:01:33,841 --> 00:01:34,560
audience.

27
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:39,510
Some part appealed to say computer
scientist or more general a computational

28
00:01:39,511 --> 00:01:43,260
folks and some part was geared
towards specialist at the end.

29
00:01:43,500 --> 00:01:46,830
So I hope there's a little
bit of a gradient on this
talk that there's a little

30
00:01:46,831 --> 00:01:50,220
something for everyone.
So if you're not so familiar with quantum,

31
00:01:50,221 --> 00:01:51,900
maybe it's a good start for you,

32
00:01:51,901 --> 00:01:54,840
but you might be off to a little bit
of a slow start if you're an expert.

33
00:01:54,870 --> 00:01:57,990
So just that caveat is I began talking.

34
00:01:58,110 --> 00:02:01,680
So what I want to talk about
is quantum computation,

35
00:02:01,681 --> 00:02:05,370
both in a general sense and
for this problem that we
think it's going to be very,

36
00:02:05,371 --> 00:02:09,060
very good for, which is the discovery
of new materials and chemistry.

37
00:02:09,540 --> 00:02:13,770
So I think it's appropriate these days
to start almost any talk in quantum

38
00:02:13,771 --> 00:02:16,710
computation with a discussion of line now.

39
00:02:16,980 --> 00:02:18,930
So if you're like anyone
else in the field,

40
00:02:18,990 --> 00:02:23,310
you've probably been looking around and
seeing news about quantum computer is

41
00:02:23,311 --> 00:02:27,000
seeing a talk about it for
probably close to two decades.

42
00:02:27,001 --> 00:02:28,680
If you've been around
for any amount of time.

43
00:02:28,980 --> 00:02:32,550
And if you kind of graph the amount of
quantum excitement over time that you

44
00:02:32,551 --> 00:02:37,200
might've seen, you'll, you'll see
a brief peek here at around 1994,

45
00:02:37,201 --> 00:02:40,800
even though it was conceived of
in the 80s by Richard Fiman, uh,

46
00:02:40,801 --> 00:02:44,130
were Shor's factoring algorithm came out.
And if you don't know what this is,

47
00:02:44,131 --> 00:02:48,990
it was an algorithm that promise to
essentially break Rsa encryption and got

48
00:02:48,991 --> 00:02:52,170
everyone in the government scared enough
that they started pouring money into it

49
00:02:52,171 --> 00:02:56,010
and the tension came. And so people
started looking at this technology saying,

50
00:02:56,040 --> 00:02:57,690
wow,
this can do incredible things.

51
00:02:57,930 --> 00:03:01,240
And you'll notice there is a brief dip
after that when people figured out that,

52
00:03:01,270 --> 00:03:03,850
wow, these devices are actually
a little bit hard to make.

53
00:03:04,210 --> 00:03:07,360
So there was a little bit of a decline
as people went back to their labs,

54
00:03:07,370 --> 00:03:10,960
refine their ideas of what they might
want to build these things from.

55
00:03:11,290 --> 00:03:14,230
And you'll see that there's been a
pretty big, uh, increased recently.

56
00:03:14,231 --> 00:03:16,780
And if you've been looking around at
the news from different companies,

57
00:03:16,781 --> 00:03:19,360
from different universities
and other places,

58
00:03:19,480 --> 00:03:23,110
you'll see that there's pretty big
increase starting to happen right here,

59
00:03:23,350 --> 00:03:26,320
which is related to the fact that our
cubits are getting much better and they're

60
00:03:26,321 --> 00:03:30,100
getting much more manufacturable.
And people are starting
to think, wow, this is a,

61
00:03:30,101 --> 00:03:32,680
this is something I need to be
ready for it because this is coming.

62
00:03:33,310 --> 00:03:36,160
And there's already been
predictions by this group,

63
00:03:36,161 --> 00:03:38,260
especially the Google
group is a leader in this,

64
00:03:38,261 --> 00:03:40,810
a quantum information field that by the,

65
00:03:41,050 --> 00:03:43,870
by the end of perhaps this year or 2018,

66
00:03:44,020 --> 00:03:46,540
that will reach a landmark
known as quantum supremacy.

67
00:03:46,840 --> 00:03:50,950
And what this means is that there will
be some well-defined computational tasks

68
00:03:51,130 --> 00:03:55,840
that a quantum device can do much faster
than all of the combined a classical

69
00:03:55,841 --> 00:03:59,710
resources on earth today. And that will
be a true milestone that says, wow,

70
00:03:59,711 --> 00:04:03,910
these devices are really capable in
practice of something that we could not do

71
00:04:03,911 --> 00:04:05,740
with the classical resources we have.

72
00:04:06,250 --> 00:04:10,570
And after that there'll be some kind of
rush to move from quantum supremacy to

73
00:04:10,571 --> 00:04:11,980
practical applications.

74
00:04:12,340 --> 00:04:16,510
And that's kind of where I'm going to
focus on is getting over this perhaps post

75
00:04:16,511 --> 00:04:20,440
supremacy chasm and really pushing this
technology forward by showing in the

76
00:04:20,441 --> 00:04:22,840
short term what practical applications,

77
00:04:22,841 --> 00:04:26,560
what useful technologies and
algorithms we can bring out of this.

78
00:04:26,890 --> 00:04:28,060
And of course after that,

79
00:04:28,061 --> 00:04:31,480
sometime in the future we're going to
move towards an error corrected quantum

80
00:04:31,481 --> 00:04:32,530
computation regime.

81
00:04:32,531 --> 00:04:35,620
And I'll talk a little bit more about
what all these things mean as the talk

82
00:04:35,621 --> 00:04:36,430
goes on.

83
00:04:36,430 --> 00:04:40,240
But really this is what I want to focus
people on is that if we can put these

84
00:04:40,241 --> 00:04:43,480
practical quantum algorithms
out there on near term devices,

85
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:44,890
then this is really going to post,

86
00:04:45,100 --> 00:04:48,010
give us new tools and push
us forward in the technology.

87
00:04:49,630 --> 00:04:53,500
So where do we expect to win? So the
other thing you might be interested in is,

88
00:04:53,501 --> 00:04:57,580
okay, great, you've delivered me a
quantum machine. Where do these machines,

89
00:04:57,640 --> 00:05:00,730
where do we expect them to you
useful and how useful will they be?

90
00:05:01,090 --> 00:05:03,220
So some of the problems that
people have talked about,

91
00:05:03,221 --> 00:05:07,120
and I'll focus only on a few of these
are perhaps the simulation of different

92
00:05:07,121 --> 00:05:07,954
reactions.

93
00:05:07,990 --> 00:05:11,470
And what I mean by that is perhaps
knowing whether a drug will work or not

94
00:05:11,471 --> 00:05:15,970
before you actually do the experiment
in a lab or knowing which drug will be

95
00:05:15,971 --> 00:05:17,950
produced by that particular catalyst.

96
00:05:18,190 --> 00:05:22,480
Or another one I'll talk about a little
bit is calculating radar cross radar

97
00:05:22,510 --> 00:05:26,260
cross sections of perhaps planes are
machines you might be interested in or

98
00:05:26,261 --> 00:05:27,940
pattern matching or machine learning.

99
00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:31,870
And of course breaking RSA encryption
if you're at three letter agency and

100
00:05:31,871 --> 00:05:33,220
you're worried about that kind of thing.

101
00:05:33,910 --> 00:05:38,290
And there's a few images of what people
might have conceived these look like and

102
00:05:38,291 --> 00:05:40,660
what is the advantage
that we actually expect.

103
00:05:40,900 --> 00:05:45,370
So what a quantum computer is not is
just a machine that runs everything you

104
00:05:45,371 --> 00:05:46,960
have at the moment faster.

105
00:05:47,380 --> 00:05:50,770
It's a new way of looking at problems
that we'll talk a little bit about the can

106
00:05:50,771 --> 00:05:52,980
get you real complexity theoretic speedup.

107
00:05:52,990 --> 00:05:57,170
So people talk about polynomial
speedups or exponential speed ups.

108
00:05:57,260 --> 00:06:00,170
So I just wanted to give you a feel
for what that might look like if you

109
00:06:00,171 --> 00:06:03,230
achieved a polynomial or
an exponential speed up.

110
00:06:03,470 --> 00:06:07,340
So if you had a quadratic speedup for a
certain instance of a problem that might

111
00:06:07,341 --> 00:06:11,930
be in a reduction of say a year down to
two weeks or something on that magnitude,

112
00:06:11,931 --> 00:06:13,610
depending on the underlying factors.

113
00:06:13,970 --> 00:06:17,270
And the really exciting one is if
you can get an exponential speed up,

114
00:06:17,420 --> 00:06:21,110
which has the potential to reduce some
problems down from something like 10 to

115
00:06:21,111 --> 00:06:24,350
the 82 years to something
more like 300 seconds.

116
00:06:24,740 --> 00:06:29,450
So what is 10 to the 82 years even
mean while the age of the universe is

117
00:06:29,451 --> 00:06:32,120
something like 14 times
10 to the nine years.

118
00:06:32,270 --> 00:06:36,380
So you've really made something that
was essentially impossible routine and

119
00:06:36,381 --> 00:06:38,270
that's the kind of goal
of a quantum device.

120
00:06:38,270 --> 00:06:42,260
That's why we're so interested in it is
the potential for these speedups to make

121
00:06:42,261 --> 00:06:44,290
the impossible.
And every day occurs.

122
00:06:45,770 --> 00:06:49,810
So now backtracking to kind
of what this technology means.

123
00:06:49,811 --> 00:06:52,820
So I've already used the word quantum
a lot and you've probably heard it any

124
00:06:52,821 --> 00:06:55,880
number of times if you've been
at all interested in this field,

125
00:06:56,060 --> 00:07:00,860
but a backup and say, what is quantum?
What do we mean by that? So if you,

126
00:07:01,100 --> 00:07:04,820
if you're biased at all by a media
marketing or anything like that today,

127
00:07:04,850 --> 00:07:08,720
you might conclude that it's a buzzword
that you attach to any product you might

128
00:07:08,721 --> 00:07:12,680
want to sell a few more of or have
it be a little bit cooler. Uh,

129
00:07:12,830 --> 00:07:17,300
I'm going to take a more physics
oriented approach and say that, you know,

130
00:07:17,480 --> 00:07:21,950
everything is quantum in a way. So the
universe is governed by quantum laws.

131
00:07:22,100 --> 00:07:24,410
But why haven't you seen
any of that in reality?

132
00:07:24,770 --> 00:07:29,450
So something that's in reality that we've
kind of observed from day to day life,

133
00:07:29,451 --> 00:07:31,340
we often characterize as classical.

134
00:07:31,610 --> 00:07:35,540
So classical objects have very predictable
behavior from your intuition because

135
00:07:35,541 --> 00:07:39,050
that's what you're used to. So take
these beanbag holes, for instance,

136
00:07:39,290 --> 00:07:40,970
you just throw a bean bag through,

137
00:07:41,090 --> 00:07:44,300
you watch its trajectory and it goes
through the whole as you might expect.

138
00:07:44,450 --> 00:07:46,970
So there's nothing terribly
hard about that prediction.

139
00:07:47,240 --> 00:07:50,930
But if you took that same object and
in fact people have done experiments on

140
00:07:50,931 --> 00:07:53,210
things quite large up
to kind of Bucky balls,

141
00:07:53,211 --> 00:07:57,230
which granted as much smaller than a bean
bag and you cooled it down enough and

142
00:07:57,231 --> 00:07:59,570
you had a precise enough
instrument to measure it,

143
00:07:59,780 --> 00:08:02,720
you would find out that if you
put one particle through that,

144
00:08:02,721 --> 00:08:05,810
so if you kept throwing that
beanbag towards these two holes,

145
00:08:06,020 --> 00:08:09,650
you would find that the beanbag
was interfering with itself,

146
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:11,780
which is kind of a strange effect to have.

147
00:08:11,930 --> 00:08:15,170
So this is a classical double
slit experiment, which, uh,

148
00:08:15,450 --> 00:08:17,630
are a quantum double slit experiment,
rather,

149
00:08:17,720 --> 00:08:20,840
that showed some of the
original properties of why
we started to think, wow,

150
00:08:20,841 --> 00:08:25,430
we need a theory beyond just balls rolling
down hills and these effects that we

151
00:08:25,431 --> 00:08:27,950
see.
So a particle interfering with itself.

152
00:08:28,040 --> 00:08:33,040
And as a result it starts to occupy only
discrete levels and looks like a very

153
00:08:33,171 --> 00:08:35,660
different type of particle
than you had otherwise.

154
00:08:35,960 --> 00:08:39,530
And when people started to try to
simulate and predict these reactions or

155
00:08:39,540 --> 00:08:41,930
effects, they said, wow,
this is really hard.

156
00:08:42,140 --> 00:08:45,380
What if we could actually use this
tool to our advantage instead?

157
00:08:45,500 --> 00:08:49,460
What if we could use this difficulty as
kind of the power of our computation?

158
00:08:49,940 --> 00:08:52,220
But I'll get them into to that more later.

159
00:08:52,221 --> 00:08:55,830
But effectively when I wanted to find
for you in a very loose sense is that a

160
00:08:55,831 --> 00:09:00,450
quantum system is some physical system
operated in a regime where we actually

161
00:09:00,451 --> 00:09:04,050
need effects like discrete energy
levels and particles interfering with

162
00:09:04,051 --> 00:09:06,810
themselves to accurately
describe it in practice.

163
00:09:06,811 --> 00:09:10,050
That often means something that's
very cold and very well controlled.

164
00:09:11,310 --> 00:09:11,580
Yeah.

165
00:09:11,580 --> 00:09:16,470
So I'm going to talk also about quantum
simulation and I think it's interesting

166
00:09:16,471 --> 00:09:18,750
to go back to the roots of simulation,

167
00:09:18,870 --> 00:09:23,130
which are actually in these
devices called Auris that are uh,

168
00:09:23,650 --> 00:09:27,750
have been dug up from sites
as earliest one 25 BC.

169
00:09:27,960 --> 00:09:31,260
So the simulation in some general
sense is that you have a model you're

170
00:09:31,261 --> 00:09:35,850
interested in and you'd like to push it
forward in time and ask what that model

171
00:09:35,851 --> 00:09:37,920
predicts.
So in the cases of Auris,

172
00:09:37,921 --> 00:09:41,970
these are models of solar systems that
you build and you crank forward either by

173
00:09:41,971 --> 00:09:44,700
hand or by a clock, and you say, does the,

174
00:09:44,730 --> 00:09:48,480
do the orbits of these fake planets
match the orbits of my real planets?

175
00:09:48,900 --> 00:09:50,340
And if the answer is yes,

176
00:09:50,370 --> 00:09:54,210
then in some sense the model that you've
constructed is somehow more correct.

177
00:09:54,750 --> 00:09:58,500
So it would be very difficult for
those particles that I just described,

178
00:09:58,501 --> 00:10:02,700
which need to interfere with each other
to be built with just classical balls.

179
00:10:02,850 --> 00:10:07,850
So a idea that originated kind of the
field of quantum simulation and thus

180
00:10:07,951 --> 00:10:11,850
quantum computing. Was it Richard
Fineman? Famous physicists said, well,

181
00:10:11,910 --> 00:10:13,740
if you want to do a quantum simulation,

182
00:10:13,860 --> 00:10:16,080
you probably need to do
it with quantum particles.

183
00:10:16,230 --> 00:10:17,910
And I'll describe it a
little bit what that means.

184
00:10:17,911 --> 00:10:22,770
But these blue balls here are kind of
just any particular quantum system you

185
00:10:22,771 --> 00:10:24,240
might have in your ability,

186
00:10:24,270 --> 00:10:28,650
these puppeteers strings on top or the
ability to experimentally control those

187
00:10:28,651 --> 00:10:31,470
much better than you could in
a different physical system.

188
00:10:31,800 --> 00:10:35,820
And we'll use that to kind of examine
what quantum particles might do.

189
00:10:36,670 --> 00:10:37,310
Okay.

190
00:10:37,310 --> 00:10:39,110
And what are examples of quantum systems?

191
00:10:39,111 --> 00:10:43,330
So I have a few pictures here of ones
that people have proposed for the use and

192
00:10:43,331 --> 00:10:47,180
computation and generally these meet the
requirement that they're in this regime

193
00:10:47,181 --> 00:10:49,700
that you need interference
effects and things like that.

194
00:10:49,910 --> 00:10:53,570
And they're also highly controllable
systems so that you can do things that you

195
00:10:53,571 --> 00:10:56,930
wouldn't be able to do in nature.
And I've pictured a number of machines,

196
00:10:56,931 --> 00:10:59,630
like super conducting cubits,
one here from the Google Group,

197
00:10:59,631 --> 00:11:04,250
one from the Sidiki group,
quantum photon setups and ion trap setups.

198
00:11:04,370 --> 00:11:07,970
Basically any number of controllable
systems that you can bring to this

199
00:11:07,971 --> 00:11:11,750
particular level, our potential building
blocks for these quantum devices,

200
00:11:11,780 --> 00:11:15,320
each with their strengths and weaknesses
that might exhibit as you start to

201
00:11:15,321 --> 00:11:16,190
manufacture them.

202
00:11:17,570 --> 00:11:18,070
Okay.

203
00:11:18,070 --> 00:11:22,210
And quantum simulation of course
was the first idea of, you know,

204
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:25,900
if you want to study the effects of a
quantum system and this is a very hard

205
00:11:25,901 --> 00:11:29,440
thing, then perhaps you can just use
another analogous quantum system,

206
00:11:29,441 --> 00:11:34,441
much like the planets and the oratory of
the example that I gave before and this

207
00:11:35,470 --> 00:11:40,180
simulation idea led almost immediately,
well, not almost immediately,

208
00:11:40,440 --> 00:11:44,260
uh, into a more abstract concept
that I'll start to introduce now,

209
00:11:44,261 --> 00:11:46,150
which is kind of Cubans.

210
00:11:46,300 --> 00:11:50,980
So it's a very big leap to say I've taken
some amount of some lasers and pushed

211
00:11:50,981 --> 00:11:52,930
around ions in a trap to,

212
00:11:53,230 --> 00:11:57,160
towards an algorithm that talks about
factoring products have two large primes.

213
00:11:57,340 --> 00:11:59,200
There's a big leap there.
It's very hard to,

214
00:11:59,240 --> 00:12:03,130
to imagine how ions resemble
these types of systems.

215
00:12:03,370 --> 00:12:07,030
But as similar leap was made in the
original systems is we moved from say,

216
00:12:07,180 --> 00:12:09,820
models of planets all the
way to digital computing.

217
00:12:09,970 --> 00:12:13,720
So it's of course very hard to imagine
how a planet fits in a digital computer.

218
00:12:14,020 --> 00:12:17,800
But we've managed to come
up with abstractions and
encodings and discriminations

219
00:12:17,830 --> 00:12:19,060
that have made this possible.

220
00:12:19,330 --> 00:12:23,260
And really the leap from quantum
simulation to quantum computation is this

221
00:12:23,261 --> 00:12:24,011
abstraction,

222
00:12:24,011 --> 00:12:27,940
this model of universality that allows
us to code problems we're interested in

223
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:32,650
and to the sophisticated devices and
leverage those powers of interference,

224
00:12:32,651 --> 00:12:37,300
entanglement and all of these hard to
describe physical effects to utilize them

225
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:38,860
in a more computational way.

226
00:12:40,290 --> 00:12:40,670
Okay.

227
00:12:40,670 --> 00:12:43,940
And so just to talk about this
quantum computing abstraction,

228
00:12:43,941 --> 00:12:45,860
you've probably heard of it many times.

229
00:12:46,100 --> 00:12:49,640
So if you imagine one of these
quantum systems that I've described,

230
00:12:49,641 --> 00:12:54,290
so if physical system in
this low controllable energy
space and it occupies only

231
00:12:54,291 --> 00:12:57,230
the first two discrete energy
levels that it's allowed to,

232
00:12:57,770 --> 00:12:59,960
then we typically are
calling this a cubit.

233
00:13:00,170 --> 00:13:03,680
So the cubit is a quantum
generalization of a classical bit.

234
00:13:03,860 --> 00:13:05,990
You may have heard this
explanation many times,

235
00:13:05,991 --> 00:13:08,420
and I'll actually debunk a
little bit of that in a second,

236
00:13:08,780 --> 00:13:12,410
which is a classical bit is
zero or one and a quantum bit.

237
00:13:12,440 --> 00:13:15,680
It's something like zero
one or anything in between.

238
00:13:15,800 --> 00:13:18,230
So you can have super
positions of these objects.

239
00:13:18,231 --> 00:13:21,770
You can have entanglement between them,
which are truly important.

240
00:13:21,771 --> 00:13:26,180
Quantum effects and operations on
these bits are just called gates.

241
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:29,130
And we typically denote this
with these gate diagrams.

242
00:13:29,131 --> 00:13:33,170
So you can read down the lines
for example, and just say, well,

243
00:13:33,171 --> 00:13:38,090
cubit one gets acted on by these gates
cubit to gets acted on by these gates and

244
00:13:38,091 --> 00:13:42,860
so on. So the details of understanding
exactly what these operations are are not

245
00:13:42,890 --> 00:13:44,660
terribly important at this juncture.

246
00:13:44,750 --> 00:13:48,380
But just to know that we have this
model of computing that we fit in our

247
00:13:48,381 --> 00:13:52,640
arbitrary problems to that much
like the modular digital computing,

248
00:13:52,641 --> 00:13:54,680
which we've built so much on in the past.

249
00:13:56,250 --> 00:13:56,540
Okay.

250
00:13:56,540 --> 00:14:00,290
And just to give you
notational, uh, familiarity,

251
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:04,130
we often call these generic state PSI.
So you'll notice with the cubit,

252
00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:07,640
I've put these brackets around the
zero and one. And with generic states,

253
00:14:07,641 --> 00:14:10,070
I'll often put a bracket
around some state side.

254
00:14:10,310 --> 00:14:12,470
It just means some number of cubits.

255
00:14:12,471 --> 00:14:15,590
Some number of these physical
systems put together, uh,

256
00:14:15,591 --> 00:14:19,800
to make my quantum computer. So I'm
going to consider a quantum computer, uh,

257
00:14:19,880 --> 00:14:24,140
a collection of one or many of these
cubits put together that I can control in

258
00:14:24,141 --> 00:14:27,560
any way that I'm interested in
within a feasible resources.

259
00:14:28,640 --> 00:14:29,150
Okay.

260
00:14:29,150 --> 00:14:33,320
So it behooves us for a moment to kind
of debunk a lot of the things that get

261
00:14:33,321 --> 00:14:37,340
written in popular science
articles on quantum computing.

262
00:14:37,670 --> 00:14:42,050
So I just like to highlight some of these
for people that are in computing, uh,

263
00:14:42,051 --> 00:14:45,800
to kind of help you understand that
there's a little bit more to the speed ups

264
00:14:45,801 --> 00:14:48,800
than meets the eye when people
discuss these algorithms.

265
00:14:49,100 --> 00:14:53,600
So one thing that gets said a lot is it's
faster or better because it can use an

266
00:14:53,601 --> 00:14:55,220
exponential number of states.

267
00:14:55,520 --> 00:14:59,900
So this is a kind of nebulous statement
cause you don't really know what it

268
00:14:59,901 --> 00:15:03,590
means. Use, you don't really
know what, uh, what you know,

269
00:15:03,591 --> 00:15:05,720
popular science writers mean by this.

270
00:15:05,930 --> 00:15:09,650
And I'd like to point out that set of
classical in bits can also be in an

271
00:15:09,651 --> 00:15:11,150
exponential number of states.

272
00:15:11,390 --> 00:15:15,740
So if you take it at a very face value
that he can just have zero one or many

273
00:15:15,741 --> 00:15:16,700
things in between,

274
00:15:16,820 --> 00:15:20,090
then there must be something a little bit
missing from that statement and little

275
00:15:20,091 --> 00:15:24,080
clarifications that are needed such as
entanglement or such as the number of

276
00:15:24,081 --> 00:15:27,080
states that can be occupied
per given resource.

277
00:15:27,800 --> 00:15:31,640
Another myth is that it's faster or
better because bits can be zero and one at

278
00:15:31,641 --> 00:15:32,474
the same time.

279
00:15:32,870 --> 00:15:37,870
So it's in fact a little bit nebulous
even to say bits are zero and one or zero

280
00:15:37,971 --> 00:15:42,740
or one quantum mechanics off
often requires actually a
different theory of logic.

281
00:15:43,010 --> 00:15:43,880
And more importantly,

282
00:15:43,881 --> 00:15:47,990
what people often mean by this is that
when you can dial between zero and one,

283
00:15:48,230 --> 00:15:51,500
that somehow occupying all those
states in the middle is more powerful.

284
00:15:51,740 --> 00:15:56,150
But if that were the only case that an
analog bit might serve just as well as a

285
00:15:56,151 --> 00:15:59,840
quantum one and a collection of analog
bits would be just as powerful as

286
00:15:59,841 --> 00:16:02,780
classical, uh, quantum
device. But that's not true.

287
00:16:03,200 --> 00:16:07,040
And a lot of these things are covered in
a very interesting comic, which debunks.

288
00:16:07,041 --> 00:16:07,880
The third myth,

289
00:16:08,030 --> 00:16:12,590
which is that work is done by computing
all the answers in massive parallel.

290
00:16:12,920 --> 00:16:15,560
And so I want to
highlight this SMBC comic,

291
00:16:15,710 --> 00:16:17,600
which is co-written by Scott Aaronson,

292
00:16:17,601 --> 00:16:22,370
which I think highlights many of the
aspects of bits. It's called the talk,

293
00:16:22,550 --> 00:16:27,350
where a mother explains to her child
the important caveats to the magic of

294
00:16:27,351 --> 00:16:31,850
quantum computing and a thing they right
here is the important thing for you to

295
00:16:31,851 --> 00:16:35,150
understand is that quantum computing
isn't just a matter of trying all the

296
00:16:35,151 --> 00:16:38,720
answers in parallel. So if you
actually thought that was the case,

297
00:16:38,990 --> 00:16:42,350
you can look into this comic and
see some of the details of why.

298
00:16:42,470 --> 00:16:45,170
If you perform measurements,
you would then only get one answer.

299
00:16:45,350 --> 00:16:48,890
And really you get the speed up when
all of these inputs combine and just the

300
00:16:48,891 --> 00:16:50,720
right way to give you
just the right answer.

301
00:16:51,170 --> 00:16:53,510
And so this is a kind of delicate matter,

302
00:16:53,511 --> 00:16:56,300
but if you read through many
pop science articles on quantum,

303
00:16:56,420 --> 00:16:58,760
you'll encounter these
arguments over and over again.

304
00:16:58,761 --> 00:17:02,450
So it helps to know that they're not
completely true or not the whole story.

305
00:17:04,460 --> 00:17:08,870
So what are the challenges in quantum
computing form an both an algorithmic and

306
00:17:08,871 --> 00:17:10,220
a design standpoint.

307
00:17:10,820 --> 00:17:15,820
So these algorithms tend to
follow a simple pattern if
you look at many of them.

308
00:17:16,551 --> 00:17:18,860
So you prepare some state of your cubits,

309
00:17:18,890 --> 00:17:22,880
meaning I manipulate the cubits in a
particular way with laser or microwave

310
00:17:22,881 --> 00:17:24,140
pulses or things like that.

311
00:17:24,320 --> 00:17:28,190
I evolve them forward under my given set
of gates sequence and I performed some

312
00:17:28,191 --> 00:17:32,210
measurement at the end and I'm measuring
out a particular piece of information.

313
00:17:32,530 --> 00:17:36,500
I'm not characterizing the entire quantum
state otherwise there's no way I would

314
00:17:36,501 --> 00:17:41,060
get out a speed up from this particular
process in each one of these steps has a

315
00:17:41,061 --> 00:17:44,480
number of challenges. For
example, in preparing the state,

316
00:17:44,810 --> 00:17:47,300
I'm often limited by the
number of cubits on my device.

317
00:17:47,301 --> 00:17:49,190
When I think of a 64 bit classical,

318
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:52,840
that doesn't mean the largest
problem I can fit in my processor.

319
00:17:52,840 --> 00:17:55,140
64 cubits are 64 bits.

320
00:17:55,470 --> 00:17:59,010
I have some ability to take problems
by chunks and move along and compute on

321
00:17:59,011 --> 00:18:02,400
them. That's often not the case with
quantum algorithms where you depend on the

322
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:06,600
entanglement between all parts to get
your speed up and chunking problems

323
00:18:06,601 --> 00:18:07,800
becomes much,
much harder.

324
00:18:07,801 --> 00:18:10,800
So we need larger devices than
we would conceive a otherwise.

325
00:18:11,310 --> 00:18:13,260
There's also issues of coherence time,

326
00:18:13,500 --> 00:18:17,430
which mean the amount of time essentially
that a cubit is good for as you're

327
00:18:17,431 --> 00:18:21,450
acting on it before you'd like to move
on or you need to refresh that particular

328
00:18:21,451 --> 00:18:25,200
device and it sets a time limit on
the number of operations that you can

329
00:18:25,201 --> 00:18:27,000
actually perform.
And finally,

330
00:18:27,001 --> 00:18:30,060
information extraction can
be a fundamentally different,

331
00:18:30,061 --> 00:18:32,880
which I'll highlight in a
particular example after this.

332
00:18:34,230 --> 00:18:38,760
And one solution to all of these problems
is of course better hardware. Um,

333
00:18:39,090 --> 00:18:43,320
but what I like to say is that we have
to meet hardware designers halfway.

334
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:46,050
We need to codesign
better algorithms as well.

335
00:18:46,350 --> 00:18:49,680
And what this means is that in the past,
like this BQE algorithm,

336
00:18:49,681 --> 00:18:51,480
we've designed coherence,
time,

337
00:18:51,481 --> 00:18:54,720
flexible algorithms that work
with the coherence time of device.

338
00:18:55,050 --> 00:18:58,110
And I think in the future we need
to worry about how to mill cubit,

339
00:18:58,111 --> 00:19:02,880
number flexible algorithms and to improve
this kind of halfway point where we

340
00:19:02,881 --> 00:19:07,320
couple quantum and classical devices
together because we really do have well a

341
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:10,980
well defined classical resources today
that hopefully we can leverage in that

342
00:19:10,981 --> 00:19:11,814
process.

343
00:19:13,110 --> 00:19:17,490
So this information
extraction extraction point,

344
00:19:17,491 --> 00:19:20,760
I want to get back to you
with one particular example
of a quantum algorithm got

345
00:19:20,761 --> 00:19:21,594
written down.

346
00:19:21,900 --> 00:19:26,030
So this algorithm thinks about
solving linear systems of equations.

347
00:19:26,031 --> 00:19:27,450
So if you're not familiar with this,

348
00:19:27,451 --> 00:19:31,440
you can just think of this as how do I
solve for x in this particular problem?

349
00:19:31,980 --> 00:19:35,670
Uh, appears in any number of say,
logistics problems, machine learning,

350
00:19:35,671 --> 00:19:39,330
everyday optimizations, things
like this. And classically,

351
00:19:39,331 --> 00:19:41,070
when I say I want to solve this problem,

352
00:19:41,180 --> 00:19:44,660
it essentially amounts to I want
to write down all the entries of x.

353
00:19:44,860 --> 00:19:49,020
And that seems like a reasonable thing
to do. A quantum algorithm came out,

354
00:19:49,021 --> 00:19:50,610
which was exponentially faster,

355
00:19:50,611 --> 00:19:53,100
which is that enormous speed
up I talked about before,

356
00:19:53,490 --> 00:19:56,130
which is exponentially faster
at delivering the solution.

357
00:19:56,310 --> 00:19:59,610
But it changed the definition
of solution a little bit. It,

358
00:19:59,670 --> 00:20:02,100
notice the brackets around
the x and the B now.

359
00:20:02,250 --> 00:20:06,600
And what it meant was the
solution translates to
preparing a state x from which

360
00:20:06,601 --> 00:20:08,070
one can efficiently sample.

361
00:20:08,610 --> 00:20:11,880
And so that's not exactly the same thing
as writing down all the entries because

362
00:20:11,881 --> 00:20:15,180
if you wrote down all the entries,
you would lose that advantage necessarily.

363
00:20:15,690 --> 00:20:19,590
And so I want to say is that's
not not a bad thing necessarily.

364
00:20:19,860 --> 00:20:22,260
What it really is,
is it solving the problem,

365
00:20:22,261 --> 00:20:24,360
not reproducing the classical algorithm.

366
00:20:24,570 --> 00:20:27,850
So if I'm out and I'm bowing
and I'm looking at my uh,

367
00:20:27,960 --> 00:20:30,330
plain and I'm trying to
make a stealth aircraft,

368
00:20:30,510 --> 00:20:34,740
do I really care about all of the entries
of where every single radar bounces or

369
00:20:34,741 --> 00:20:37,860
do I care about an aggregate
cross section as fast as possible?

370
00:20:38,190 --> 00:20:40,680
And if the answer is that I
care about this cross section,

371
00:20:40,920 --> 00:20:45,150
then really what I've done is use a new
tool to solve this problem rather than

372
00:20:45,151 --> 00:20:49,900
just translate an old classical algorithm
and this step was necessary in order

373
00:20:49,901 --> 00:20:51,670
to achieve this quantum speed up.

374
00:20:51,790 --> 00:20:55,150
And it's one that I think you have to
conceptualize moving forward as what

375
00:20:55,151 --> 00:20:56,410
quantum computers are good at.

376
00:20:56,680 --> 00:21:00,400
Quantum computers are not about taking
an old classical algorithm and running it

377
00:21:00,401 --> 00:21:04,030
faster. There are about using a new set
of tools to solve the problem that you're

378
00:21:04,031 --> 00:21:06,250
interested in in a fundamentally new day.

379
00:21:06,550 --> 00:21:10,840
And I think that's highlighted very well
by this particular a comparison between

380
00:21:10,841 --> 00:21:14,410
the classical and quantum version of
solving a system of linear equations.

381
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:19,600
So where do we think early applications
are going to be highlighted for these

382
00:21:19,601 --> 00:21:20,800
particular devices?

383
00:21:21,250 --> 00:21:25,240
We think some of the earliest problems
perhaps will not be breaking codes or you

384
00:21:25,241 --> 00:21:29,170
know, bringing down the world financial
system or something like that. Uh,

385
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:31,510
there'll be an areas like a optimization,

386
00:21:31,511 --> 00:21:35,930
so say quantum approximate optimization
of logistics or other multivariant

387
00:21:36,070 --> 00:21:38,650
surfaces that you might
find in any kind of problem.

388
00:21:38,950 --> 00:21:41,680
They might be in some kind
of relational representation.

389
00:21:41,681 --> 00:21:45,580
So you can think of different kinds
of quantum neural networks that link

390
00:21:45,581 --> 00:21:49,330
together variables in a way you
didn't know how to do before. Uh,

391
00:21:49,360 --> 00:21:50,890
and the one that I'm interested in,

392
00:21:50,891 --> 00:21:53,710
and I'm going to talk a little bit
more about is quantum simulation.

393
00:21:53,950 --> 00:21:57,130
So this idea of how you perform
experiments that should have gone,

394
00:21:57,400 --> 00:22:01,600
that would have needed to go and do a
laboratory on a computer beforehand and

395
00:22:01,660 --> 00:22:06,010
areas like chemistry or perhaps even
high energy physics where you can predict

396
00:22:06,011 --> 00:22:09,010
what catachesis would happen
inside the fusion of a nucleus.

397
00:22:09,250 --> 00:22:14,250
Or perhaps you could look at what drugs
are disease preventing are the types of

398
00:22:14,381 --> 00:22:16,030
simulations that we want to look at.

399
00:22:16,240 --> 00:22:19,000
And I'm going to focus in on
quantum chemistry in particular.

400
00:22:20,440 --> 00:22:24,610
So why do we want to simulate quantum
chemistry or why do we want to simulate

401
00:22:24,611 --> 00:22:27,370
chemistry in general?
What is the dream of this field?

402
00:22:27,371 --> 00:22:32,140
Essentially the dream is that some someone
gives you an idea of what a molecule

403
00:22:32,141 --> 00:22:35,710
or a protein or something in someone's
body looks like or a material.

404
00:22:35,890 --> 00:22:39,400
And just from that, I would like
to understand many things about it.

405
00:22:39,430 --> 00:22:41,530
I'd like to understand
how it absorbs light,

406
00:22:41,800 --> 00:22:44,710
like to understand how it
complexes with other species.

407
00:22:44,950 --> 00:22:49,360
I like to understand how that molecule
likes to talk to surfaces and move around.

408
00:22:49,690 --> 00:22:53,260
And from that understanding,
I'd like to develop some level of control.

409
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:55,540
So if I know why a molecule absorbs light,

410
00:22:55,570 --> 00:22:59,200
what functional groups of fact that
maybe I can design new photovoltaics,

411
00:22:59,201 --> 00:23:00,970
new solar cells to put on my house.

412
00:23:01,300 --> 00:23:05,560
If I know why certain species complex
within a protein or why a protein folds

413
00:23:05,561 --> 00:23:06,394
are misfolds,

414
00:23:06,580 --> 00:23:10,120
maybe I can design an inhibitor that
prevents the onset of certain types of

415
00:23:10,121 --> 00:23:10,954
diseases.

416
00:23:11,140 --> 00:23:15,220
And if I know why molecules complex
with these catalytic surfaces,

417
00:23:15,400 --> 00:23:19,330
maybe I can get platinum out of my
catalytic converters and understand how to

418
00:23:19,331 --> 00:23:21,700
lower the energy consumption
of these processes.

419
00:23:22,270 --> 00:23:25,630
And these are things that are all made
possible only by very high accuracy

420
00:23:25,631 --> 00:23:28,600
simulations, which are the kind
that we're going to be aiming for.

421
00:23:29,830 --> 00:23:32,650
And this problem is also an
interesting one because you might say,

422
00:23:32,710 --> 00:23:35,920
well all those things you just
described sound like very lofty goals,

423
00:23:36,070 --> 00:23:37,780
but where are you even
going to start from?

424
00:23:38,170 --> 00:23:41,680
And it's an interesting problem
because the underlying laws,

425
00:23:41,920 --> 00:23:45,680
physical laws necessary
for the mathematical theory
of a large part of physics

426
00:23:45,770 --> 00:23:48,440
and the whole of chemistry
or that's completely known.

427
00:23:48,590 --> 00:23:51,740
And the difficulty is only that the
exact application of these laws,

428
00:23:51,770 --> 00:23:55,910
we do equations much too complicated to
be soluble. So it said by physicists,

429
00:23:55,911 --> 00:24:00,080
Paul Dirac, and what he
essentially meant was that you can,

430
00:24:00,350 --> 00:24:02,600
if you could just solve
equations large enough.

431
00:24:02,601 --> 00:24:07,220
So this very innocuous equation that I
have written on the right hand side here

432
00:24:07,310 --> 00:24:10,430
essentially represents all of those
things that I was just talking about.

433
00:24:10,670 --> 00:24:14,660
If I can find a way to code a molecule
into these equations and solve this

434
00:24:14,661 --> 00:24:18,710
linear eigenvalue problem, then I'm
going to start to understand, you know,

435
00:24:18,740 --> 00:24:22,100
how these molecules absorb light,
how they complex with other species,

436
00:24:22,101 --> 00:24:25,730
what are the rates of chemical reactions
and do everything that I just talked

437
00:24:25,731 --> 00:24:29,840
about. And so that's kind of the
exciting dream of of quantum chemistry.

438
00:24:29,841 --> 00:24:32,720
And it's one I think we can
achieve with quantum computers.

439
00:24:32,750 --> 00:24:35,900
And one problem that I want to
highlight for this in particular.

440
00:24:35,901 --> 00:24:39,230
So you say that's a very general
type of argument that you've made.

441
00:24:39,231 --> 00:24:40,850
What specifically are
you going to look at?

442
00:24:41,450 --> 00:24:43,790
And I want to highlight for
you one particular problem,

443
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:46,640
which is the production of
fertilizer from nitrogen.

444
00:24:46,850 --> 00:24:50,150
This is a process that goes on
all over the world all the time.

445
00:24:50,270 --> 00:24:54,530
It's how do you take into and make it
into ammonia says nitrogen fixation

446
00:24:54,531 --> 00:24:58,410
problem. And humans currently
do this at massive scales.

447
00:24:58,440 --> 00:25:00,260
We do it for crops all around the world.

448
00:25:00,530 --> 00:25:02,990
And we use a process
called the harbor process,

449
00:25:03,110 --> 00:25:07,640
which happens at 400 degrees Celsius
and 200 times atmospheric pressure and

450
00:25:07,641 --> 00:25:11,030
currently uses one to 2% of
all energy on earth today.

451
00:25:11,480 --> 00:25:14,730
And then we look over at our, our
friends in the plant kingdom and the, uh,

452
00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:18,890
animal kingdom and fun guy. And we
say, well, how do these guys do it?

453
00:25:18,920 --> 00:25:23,390
They existed long before we had fertilizer
plants building all of this chemical

454
00:25:23,391 --> 00:25:28,391
processes and they managed to do it at
25 degrees Celsius and one atmospheric

455
00:25:28,521 --> 00:25:31,490
pressure. So Room temperature and
atmospheric pressure essentially.

456
00:25:32,030 --> 00:25:36,860
And people have managed to boil down in
one particular area in nitrogenase where

457
00:25:36,861 --> 00:25:40,700
the action is happening to this
kind of for Moco cores they call it.

458
00:25:40,880 --> 00:25:43,070
And people have tried to study
this with current methods.

459
00:25:43,071 --> 00:25:46,940
And it's beyond the reach of all current
classical methods to really understand

460
00:25:46,941 --> 00:25:49,940
even where the substrate
attachment happens,

461
00:25:50,120 --> 00:25:54,050
what the electronic structure processes
and how we can move forward on this

462
00:25:54,051 --> 00:25:57,140
problem. And what I want to propose
is that while there's no clear path,

463
00:25:57,141 --> 00:26:01,520
classically I think quantum mechanically
with something like 150 to 200 logical

464
00:26:01,521 --> 00:26:02,240
cubits,

465
00:26:02,240 --> 00:26:06,830
there's kind of a straight path forward
to studying the electronic structure of

466
00:26:06,831 --> 00:26:11,450
this problem.
And so why is this problem so difficult?

467
00:26:11,690 --> 00:26:15,680
So I talked about the fact that I only
needed to solve this one very simple

468
00:26:15,681 --> 00:26:20,090
looking equation in all of
these properties would come
to me as I, I imagined.

469
00:26:20,510 --> 00:26:23,420
So the problem is not in the the setup,

470
00:26:23,480 --> 00:26:26,960
it's in the dimension that you need
to solve. So if you imagine that the,

471
00:26:26,961 --> 00:26:30,980
another way of phrasing this problem
that I want to solve is that I would like

472
00:26:30,981 --> 00:26:33,650
to know where I should put all
the electrons in my system.

473
00:26:33,890 --> 00:26:36,140
So this is called the
electronic structure problem.

474
00:26:36,500 --> 00:26:39,650
And if you imagine that I disagree ties
things as I always need to do for a

475
00:26:39,651 --> 00:26:41,810
computer and put down m sites,

476
00:26:42,020 --> 00:26:46,290
I can ask how many ways can I arrange
each of these, number of electrons.

477
00:26:46,520 --> 00:26:50,970
And if it's just one, I can arrange
them m number of ways. And if it's too,

478
00:26:51,030 --> 00:26:54,810
it's m squared, making some course
arguments about anti symmetry.

479
00:26:55,290 --> 00:27:00,290
And if I go to just say a hundred
sites and say 80 particles.

480
00:27:00,841 --> 00:27:04,440
So you can see that this grows as em
to the end and that's about the size of

481
00:27:04,441 --> 00:27:07,980
molecule you might expect for something
like a hundred sites that I've pictured,

482
00:27:07,981 --> 00:27:09,780
they're much smaller than a protein.

483
00:27:10,050 --> 00:27:13,350
The dimension of this problem that I need
to solve becomes 10 to the hundred and

484
00:27:13,351 --> 00:27:17,190
60 so this is a number that's
very hard to get a feeling for a,

485
00:27:17,191 --> 00:27:18,960
so I've given you a barometer for that,

486
00:27:18,961 --> 00:27:22,500
which is the number of particles in the
universe is estimated to be roughly 10

487
00:27:22,501 --> 00:27:27,000
to the 80 so that's as if every particle
in the universe had another universe

488
00:27:27,001 --> 00:27:27,600
within it.

489
00:27:27,600 --> 00:27:31,470
And I needed to account for all of the
particles in those and I need to solve a

490
00:27:31,471 --> 00:27:35,400
problem. It's on the dimension of that
scale, which seems totally intractable.

491
00:27:35,490 --> 00:27:39,090
But I want to remind you that this
same difficulty is the power that we're

492
00:27:39,091 --> 00:27:41,070
harnessing when we use a quantum computer.

493
00:27:41,250 --> 00:27:44,130
So we've essentially turned our
lemons into lemonade in a way.

494
00:27:45,280 --> 00:27:45,710
Yeah.

495
00:27:45,710 --> 00:27:49,880
So I just want to draw back and aside
for everyone who might not be familiar

496
00:27:49,881 --> 00:27:53,780
with quantum to understand another
exponential object that you might be more

497
00:27:53,781 --> 00:27:57,170
familiar with in the relation
between that and this problem.

498
00:27:57,320 --> 00:28:01,010
So you might be more familiar with
probability distributions where you say if

499
00:28:01,011 --> 00:28:04,940
you have say 16 different places that
you might like to look for lunch and you

500
00:28:04,941 --> 00:28:06,860
have your own set of preferences,

501
00:28:06,890 --> 00:28:10,850
p one for each store that you go to
and someone else has their own set of

502
00:28:10,851 --> 00:28:13,430
preferences.
If the two of you don't know each other,

503
00:28:13,431 --> 00:28:15,770
these probability
distributions factorized.

504
00:28:15,800 --> 00:28:19,430
So even though this joint distribution
on the left has a lot of size,

505
00:28:19,431 --> 00:28:22,680
the structure allows you to
kind of simplify this problem.

506
00:28:22,681 --> 00:28:25,400
So you only need a linear
amount of information. However,

507
00:28:25,401 --> 00:28:29,060
if the two of you definitely know each
other, whether your friends or enemies,

508
00:28:29,240 --> 00:28:32,120
then a correlation gets introduced
between those two things.

509
00:28:32,300 --> 00:28:36,140
And that no longer factor rises. And
you can imagine if there's, you know,

510
00:28:36,470 --> 00:28:39,200
and if these are many,
many of these stores and many,

511
00:28:39,201 --> 00:28:42,950
many of these people keeping that joint
probability distribution is horribly

512
00:28:42,951 --> 00:28:43,784
complex.

513
00:28:43,940 --> 00:28:48,290
And the key caveat of why quantum is
different from these types of probability

514
00:28:48,291 --> 00:28:52,940
distributions is that classically we
know how to sample from even these large

515
00:28:52,941 --> 00:28:55,400
spaces using things like
Monte Carlo methods.

516
00:28:55,640 --> 00:28:59,810
But that interference phenomenon that I
talked about and entanglement mean that

517
00:28:59,811 --> 00:29:01,550
we can't use some of these methods.

518
00:29:01,760 --> 00:29:05,600
It's unheard of in classical probability
that two people would interfere with

519
00:29:05,601 --> 00:29:07,730
each other and not be in a store,
for example.

520
00:29:08,030 --> 00:29:11,150
And having to account for these
effects makes it very hard to simulate

521
00:29:11,151 --> 00:29:11,984
classically,

522
00:29:13,450 --> 00:29:13,990
okay,

523
00:29:13,990 --> 00:29:17,770
so how do we actually simulate these
problems on a quantum computer?

524
00:29:17,771 --> 00:29:21,310
So I've told you that there's a lot of
promise for doing so and I want to show

525
00:29:21,311 --> 00:29:23,380
you how we actually start
to build these things.

526
00:29:23,560 --> 00:29:25,990
So if we go way back to
say high school chemistry,

527
00:29:25,991 --> 00:29:30,270
you might've seen a model that looks
like some electrons rotating around, uh,

528
00:29:30,460 --> 00:29:34,360
a proton and a neutron.
And then if you continue taking chemistry,

529
00:29:34,420 --> 00:29:37,420
you learn very quickly that perhaps
this model is not so accurate.

530
00:29:37,430 --> 00:29:39,670
It doesn't make many predictions at all.

531
00:29:39,880 --> 00:29:43,690
And if you entered chem hundred one
and say something in university,

532
00:29:43,960 --> 00:29:45,940
you might've found the
molecular orbital model,

533
00:29:45,941 --> 00:29:49,060
which is often pictured as the
last vestige of these things.

534
00:29:49,450 --> 00:29:51,820
And I want to tell you that
this molecular orbital model,

535
00:29:51,821 --> 00:29:55,540
which predicts things like bond order
and where the spins are is exactly like

536
00:29:55,541 --> 00:29:58,450
that factorized probability
distribution that I had before.

537
00:29:58,720 --> 00:30:01,990
It assumes no explicit
correlation of the electrons.

538
00:30:01,991 --> 00:30:05,710
It's like a naive Bayes model. If you're
doing machine learning and it's not a,

539
00:30:05,711 --> 00:30:09,040
it's not a good enough model,
so it's simple but it's not good enough.

540
00:30:09,041 --> 00:30:13,750
And to give you a picture for what that
might mean, it's so if I have some,

541
00:30:14,080 --> 00:30:18,010
I wrote down that same picture for the
simplest molecule like h two which is a

542
00:30:18,011 --> 00:30:20,530
hydrogen molecule and
I try to pull it apart,

543
00:30:20,560 --> 00:30:22,780
which is this picture that
I have over to the right.

544
00:30:23,080 --> 00:30:26,230
Then I would find that while
the shape is generally okay,

545
00:30:26,380 --> 00:30:29,230
what I would predict is this
top dotted line up here,

546
00:30:29,440 --> 00:30:33,850
which is seems to be quite a bit off
from the exact line underneath it.

547
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:37,600
So you come to the conclusion that if
chemistry is anything at all to do with

548
00:30:37,601 --> 00:30:40,270
the making and breaking of bonds,
which you feel it might be,

549
00:30:40,480 --> 00:30:42,910
then this is not a
sufficiently good a model.

550
00:30:43,180 --> 00:30:46,390
And the reason for this is electrons
actually care a lot about where the other

551
00:30:46,391 --> 00:30:47,111
electrons are.

552
00:30:47,111 --> 00:30:51,220
These correlation effects make the wave
function very much non separable in

553
00:30:51,221 --> 00:30:52,360
these types of regions.

554
00:30:52,600 --> 00:30:55,240
And you have to figure out a way
to build that into your model.

555
00:30:57,100 --> 00:30:59,470
So how do we put these,
these things in?

556
00:30:59,650 --> 00:31:02,470
So I don't want to Belabor
the the symbols here too much,

557
00:31:02,800 --> 00:31:07,750
but essentially we take some model of
space and we chopped that model of space

558
00:31:07,751 --> 00:31:10,960
up. So in much the same way, if
you drew a line on a computer,

559
00:31:10,961 --> 00:31:14,260
you would eventually have to go down to
the pixels and discreetly draw each one

560
00:31:14,261 --> 00:31:17,110
of them on your screen.
We have to do the same thing here.

561
00:31:17,200 --> 00:31:20,830
So we divide the space up and we
put it down on some type of grid.

562
00:31:20,831 --> 00:31:23,830
We choose a specialized grid,
but this is essentially the same.

563
00:31:24,220 --> 00:31:28,570
And the output of this is this
problem Hamiltonian that you get here.

564
00:31:28,750 --> 00:31:31,480
And the only thing I want to emphasize
about that is that we classically

565
00:31:31,500 --> 00:31:35,140
precomputed and it tells us everything
about the problem that we'd want to solve.

566
00:31:35,800 --> 00:31:39,430
We often then go ahead and solve that
mean field problem that I took told you

567
00:31:39,431 --> 00:31:42,220
about to get a decent starting
point for where we want to go.

568
00:31:42,430 --> 00:31:45,370
And this defines this concept
of molecular orbitals for us,

569
00:31:45,371 --> 00:31:49,210
these different levels that things can
fill that are these uncorrelated motions

570
00:31:49,211 --> 00:31:53,590
of electrons and how do we
build in the correlations.

571
00:31:53,591 --> 00:31:58,000
And the simplest possible way is that I
could go back and ask about that sort of

572
00:31:58,001 --> 00:32:02,260
joint probability distribution by could
just enumerate every single possibility

573
00:32:02,261 --> 00:32:04,600
of filling.
Then that would be one way to solve it.

574
00:32:04,630 --> 00:32:08,140
It would of course scale horribly like
this universe size solution that I had

575
00:32:08,141 --> 00:32:11,350
before, but conceptually it's
the simplest way of doing so.

576
00:32:11,560 --> 00:32:15,160
And it's often called exact diagonalis
operation or full configuration

577
00:32:15,161 --> 00:32:16,330
interaction in chemistry.

578
00:32:16,870 --> 00:32:20,650
And of course there's been many methods
between this mean field uncorrelated and

579
00:32:20,651 --> 00:32:22,780
the exact solution
developed over the years.

580
00:32:23,080 --> 00:32:24,970
And I won't Belabor this slide too much,

581
00:32:25,150 --> 00:32:28,690
but the gist of it is many of the
classical methods for those problems that

582
00:32:28,691 --> 00:32:33,691
we're interested in are either too costly
or they don't capture the correlations

583
00:32:33,761 --> 00:32:37,720
that we need enough. So what we'd like
is kind of this exact level description,

584
00:32:37,900 --> 00:32:42,380
but for a cost of a method that something
more like density functional theory

585
00:32:42,381 --> 00:32:46,550
here or perhaps Qmc or Monte
Carlo or something like that.

586
00:32:46,760 --> 00:32:49,100
So exact solutions of the quality we need,

587
00:32:49,130 --> 00:32:51,080
but for the price that
we can afford to pay.

588
00:32:51,890 --> 00:32:54,590
And so why do we think quantum
computers might be good at this?

589
00:32:54,591 --> 00:32:58,010
So a paper that came out in
2005 by Alon Esper Guzik,

590
00:32:58,011 --> 00:33:02,270
who's now at Harvard and was my
phd advisor as well as Ryan's, uh,

591
00:33:02,300 --> 00:33:05,810
showed that for some instances
of chemical problems, I will,

592
00:33:06,050 --> 00:33:10,730
if you put in a say under certain
assumptions, then computing that energy,

593
00:33:10,731 --> 00:33:15,050
which I just told you about only costs
a time that scales polynomial in the

594
00:33:15,051 --> 00:33:17,660
system rather than this
universe sized object.

595
00:33:17,960 --> 00:33:21,790
And a key portion of this is that
you prepare the state, you have look,

596
00:33:21,800 --> 00:33:22,790
do some evolution,

597
00:33:22,791 --> 00:33:25,730
but your measurement only extracts
a little bit of information.

598
00:33:25,880 --> 00:33:28,940
It doesn't read out that whole state
because you don't care about that whole

599
00:33:28,941 --> 00:33:32,210
state. There are pieces of that state
and you'd like to know things about.

600
00:33:32,300 --> 00:33:37,160
But your quantum computer has allowed
you a way to zoom in on the information

601
00:33:37,161 --> 00:33:40,340
you want without being burdened by
the information that you don't need.

602
00:33:41,090 --> 00:33:42,950
And this,

603
00:33:43,010 --> 00:33:47,360
this led people this see that classically
this might have an exponential costs

604
00:33:47,510 --> 00:33:50,720
and quantum mechanically it seemed
like a modest polynomial costs.

605
00:33:51,050 --> 00:33:54,710
The challenge when we went to put it on
experimental devices was that it often

606
00:33:54,711 --> 00:33:57,740
required many more resources
than were available in the lab.

607
00:33:58,040 --> 00:34:01,550
So we tried to look towards a different
approach and we took a codesign

608
00:34:01,551 --> 00:34:03,410
perspective.
So what do I mean by that?

609
00:34:03,650 --> 00:34:07,670
So if you imagine the previous perspective
as someone kind of sits down with a

610
00:34:07,671 --> 00:34:08,390
problem,

611
00:34:08,390 --> 00:34:11,750
they try to write down a circuit
specification that optimally solves this

612
00:34:11,751 --> 00:34:12,500
problem.

613
00:34:12,500 --> 00:34:15,710
And then there's a big question mark
because of this Cuban coherence time

614
00:34:15,711 --> 00:34:19,880
problem of does it fit in my quantum
blue Jean Queue? And if it does,

615
00:34:19,881 --> 00:34:22,730
it gives me the answer to life
and everything. If it doesn't,

616
00:34:22,760 --> 00:34:25,640
then perhaps it's simply doesn't run,
which isn't very useful.

617
00:34:26,090 --> 00:34:30,110
So what we wanted to do instead was
considered the tasks and the current

618
00:34:30,111 --> 00:34:33,350
architecture and try to find
the best solution possible.

619
00:34:34,670 --> 00:34:38,870
So what this means is kind of combining
the problem and the architecture that we

620
00:34:38,871 --> 00:34:40,970
have,
getting a circuit sequence,

621
00:34:40,971 --> 00:34:44,390
it's compatible with these two and
doing kind of a classical feedback loop.

622
00:34:44,630 --> 00:34:47,030
So the answer we get back
out might not be perfect.

623
00:34:47,031 --> 00:34:49,730
So it might only be close to the
answer to life and everything.

624
00:34:49,930 --> 00:34:53,630
For a lot of chemical applications say,
does this react or not?

625
00:34:53,631 --> 00:34:54,980
Is this a valid drug or not?

626
00:34:55,220 --> 00:34:58,460
Where you're only interested in some
course answer that depends on an accurate

627
00:34:58,461 --> 00:35:01,010
energy that might be better
than you can do. Classically,

628
00:35:01,011 --> 00:35:03,920
it might be good enough to make that
prediction that you're interested in.

629
00:35:05,630 --> 00:35:08,690
And to do this, you need to ask, okay,

630
00:35:08,720 --> 00:35:11,330
so I have a quantum computer
with limited resources.

631
00:35:11,480 --> 00:35:15,560
How do I build to that device? What
does this device best at doing? What?

632
00:35:15,680 --> 00:35:18,950
What are kind of the minimal
specifications for which
I can call this a quantum

633
00:35:18,951 --> 00:35:23,060
computer? And one is I would like
to be able to do an operation,

634
00:35:23,061 --> 00:35:25,430
which if I've done all
of my state preparation,

635
00:35:25,460 --> 00:35:28,790
I'd like it to be able to look at a cubit
and ask, is this cubit a zero or a one?

636
00:35:29,120 --> 00:35:31,880
And I'd like to do that over
and over again until I've,

637
00:35:32,090 --> 00:35:34,820
I've decided what the average
value of that might be.

638
00:35:35,330 --> 00:35:38,070
And I'd also like to look at
many cubits at the same time.

639
00:35:38,250 --> 00:35:40,590
And I'd like to ask what
those correlated values are.

640
00:35:40,800 --> 00:35:44,430
So this is something that's efficient
to do on any prepared quantum state.

641
00:35:44,640 --> 00:35:48,450
But in general it might be very hard to
calculate this expectation value on a

642
00:35:48,451 --> 00:35:51,510
classical device depending on
the state that I've prepared.

643
00:35:51,810 --> 00:35:54,300
So I've really boiled
down to some essence,

644
00:35:54,540 --> 00:35:58,500
at least one simple operation for a
prepared state that would be very hard for

645
00:35:58,501 --> 00:35:59,490
me to do classically.

646
00:36:00,480 --> 00:36:04,080
So how am I going to use
this on my chemistry problem?

647
00:36:04,290 --> 00:36:07,140
So I'm going to switch formulations a bit.

648
00:36:07,200 --> 00:36:10,530
And so that problem that I showed you
before was written as an eigenvalue

649
00:36:10,531 --> 00:36:11,190
problem.

650
00:36:11,190 --> 00:36:15,090
And it turns out that for exterior
eigenvalues you can play a little bait and

651
00:36:15,091 --> 00:36:19,800
switch and you can always
write a eigenvalue problem
as a minimization over this

652
00:36:19,801 --> 00:36:21,540
kind of constrained unit vector.

653
00:36:21,750 --> 00:36:25,560
And so I'm going to switch over into that
formulation and say, now the problem,

654
00:36:25,561 --> 00:36:29,040
I would like to solve it some
minimization of an average quantity.

655
00:36:29,760 --> 00:36:34,140
And if I decompose my Hamiltonian and
the the way that standard for some of

656
00:36:34,141 --> 00:36:34,974
these systems,

657
00:36:35,370 --> 00:36:39,990
then essentially by linearity I get a
problem that this expectation value that

658
00:36:39,991 --> 00:36:43,860
I'd like to minimize over that is
equivalent to my eigenvalue problem.

659
00:36:44,370 --> 00:36:48,210
I have two tasks,
one which is easy for a quantum computer.

660
00:36:48,270 --> 00:36:51,510
So I need to compute a bunch
of these little averages here.

661
00:36:51,690 --> 00:36:55,110
So repeatedly looking at each cubit
and telling me if it's zero or one.

662
00:36:55,290 --> 00:36:58,320
And then I have those inputs that
I got from the discretization.

663
00:36:58,321 --> 00:37:02,520
I chose how I divided my problem up and
my classical computer is very good at

664
00:37:02,521 --> 00:37:03,840
adding a lot of numbers together.

665
00:37:03,841 --> 00:37:07,080
So why wouldn't I use that resource
for this particular problem?

666
00:37:07,530 --> 00:37:11,130
So I perform a bunch of measurements
on my quantum computer, which are easy.

667
00:37:11,370 --> 00:37:15,240
I feed those to my classical computer
and ask it for an update step.

668
00:37:15,450 --> 00:37:18,140
So this kind of suggests
the hybrid scheme, right?

669
00:37:18,141 --> 00:37:22,350
Parameterize my quantum state with some
classical experimental parameters and I

670
00:37:22,351 --> 00:37:26,530
compute averages using a quantum
computer and I update that state, uh,

671
00:37:26,550 --> 00:37:28,200
passively and pictorially.

672
00:37:28,201 --> 00:37:31,950
This algorithm kind of looks like this
where I have a quantum module where I

673
00:37:31,951 --> 00:37:36,630
prepare some state and feed it in these
expectation values that I read out and I

674
00:37:36,631 --> 00:37:38,610
add them together on
my classical computer.

675
00:37:38,670 --> 00:37:42,540
And then I just looped that algorithm
back and back and back until I've reached

676
00:37:42,541 --> 00:37:46,800
some level of convergence, which I think
represents how good that device can do.

677
00:37:46,950 --> 00:37:51,300
So again, the answer might not be the
best at absolutely possible because you're

678
00:37:51,301 --> 00:37:53,280
constrained by the device itself,

679
00:37:53,310 --> 00:37:56,460
but it's perhaps better than you
could do on a classical device.

680
00:37:58,050 --> 00:38:02,670
So this is interesting because if I
showed you the algorithm before just

681
00:38:02,671 --> 00:38:05,610
briefly, which was this quantum
circuit, I just described,

682
00:38:05,611 --> 00:38:08,040
an algorithm that looks
effectively like this,

683
00:38:08,190 --> 00:38:11,820
which is that I've removed all of this
interior part without the millions and

684
00:38:11,820 --> 00:38:15,960
millions of quantum gates in it. Uh, and
so where is the advantage coming from?

685
00:38:15,961 --> 00:38:18,330
It has to come from that
state that I've input.

686
00:38:18,570 --> 00:38:21,990
So it really begs the question of what
are the interesting quantum states to

687
00:38:21,991 --> 00:38:25,530
look at? If you imagine the, they,
the space of all possible states,

688
00:38:25,710 --> 00:38:29,250
somewhere inside it's the ones I can
reasonably make on my quantum computer.

689
00:38:29,400 --> 00:38:32,820
And within that there's the ones that are
easy to model on a classical computer.

690
00:38:32,970 --> 00:38:35,500
So I'm really looking at
this part in the blue space,

691
00:38:35,501 --> 00:38:39,550
which is not covered by the yellow here
and where, where do those states live.

692
00:38:39,551 --> 00:38:42,940
And I think that's one of the
most interesting questions
that a quantum computer

693
00:38:42,941 --> 00:38:44,770
is going to be able to answer for us.

694
00:38:45,520 --> 00:38:50,470
And kind of conveniently for that is
that I can then define what states I want

695
00:38:50,471 --> 00:38:52,510
to explore by the device that I have.

696
00:38:52,780 --> 00:38:57,250
So if you call it a quantum hardware on
sites are sometimes sub logical onsets,

697
00:38:57,550 --> 00:39:01,660
then you can imagine that that parameter
space you explore is any of the knobs

698
00:39:01,661 --> 00:39:03,820
that you can repeatedly
turn on your device.

699
00:39:04,060 --> 00:39:06,070
So that if you can do
that operation twice,

700
00:39:06,071 --> 00:39:09,640
you can call that some quantum state
you're interested in and you use the

701
00:39:09,641 --> 00:39:11,950
complexity of the device
to your advantage.

702
00:39:12,130 --> 00:39:16,270
And the coherence time requirements are
going to be set by the device instead of

703
00:39:16,271 --> 00:39:19,840
the algorithm. It won't be that case
that you get, I need 10 million gates.

704
00:39:19,900 --> 00:39:22,090
Why can't do till million gates?
And you get nothing.

705
00:39:22,091 --> 00:39:26,500
It's I have this amount of time and you
get the best answer you can within that

706
00:39:26,501 --> 00:39:27,334
window of time.

707
00:39:28,720 --> 00:39:32,200
And of course we have some theoretical
constructs that I won't go too deeply

708
00:39:32,201 --> 00:39:33,550
into, but, uh,

709
00:39:33,551 --> 00:39:37,870
we like to be able to design these
particular onsites as as well in a logical

710
00:39:37,871 --> 00:39:40,780
formalism.
So of course,

711
00:39:40,810 --> 00:39:43,810
I haven't really talked about what
happens with quantum errors yet.

712
00:39:43,960 --> 00:39:46,330
So you can imagine that these
devices are not perfect.

713
00:39:46,331 --> 00:39:50,020
I've alluded to this many times, and
if you look at the level of the device,

714
00:39:50,021 --> 00:39:53,020
you might imagine that there are
certain areas called coherent errors.

715
00:39:53,200 --> 00:39:57,070
So imagine if I, an example of this,
if I want to rotate by some angle,

716
00:39:57,250 --> 00:40:00,130
but every time I rotate
by little bit too far,

717
00:40:00,131 --> 00:40:02,200
then that's going to be
a type of coherent error.

718
00:40:02,590 --> 00:40:05,530
And this quantum device also
lives in a larger environment.

719
00:40:05,740 --> 00:40:09,190
So it's always seeing
electromagnetic waves coming in.

720
00:40:09,191 --> 00:40:13,330
Maybe it's even feeling the effects of
temperature from bleeding in from the

721
00:40:13,331 --> 00:40:14,164
outside.

722
00:40:14,200 --> 00:40:18,230
And this is going to cause kind of random
errors that look more like a third or

723
00:40:18,280 --> 00:40:21,490
more incoherent.
So these are types of defacing EHRs.

724
00:40:21,580 --> 00:40:25,810
So how does this algorithm perform in
the presence of these types of types of

725
00:40:25,811 --> 00:40:26,644
noise?

726
00:40:26,710 --> 00:40:30,880
And one of the things we conjectured is
it because of this classical feedback

727
00:40:30,881 --> 00:40:35,650
loop that certain types of coherent errors
would be corrected by this procedure?

728
00:40:36,130 --> 00:40:38,030
And we're lucky enough to have,
uh,

729
00:40:38,080 --> 00:40:41,950
participated in experiment
and collaboration here with
the Google group actually

730
00:40:42,250 --> 00:40:44,740
that showed that this was,
this was in fact the case.

731
00:40:44,741 --> 00:40:47,230
So let me describe briefly
what this image shows.

732
00:40:47,560 --> 00:40:51,580
So it's actually a good depiction of what
a quantum quantum algorithm looks like

733
00:40:51,581 --> 00:40:53,560
in practice,
or at least a small scale one.

734
00:40:53,980 --> 00:40:57,940
So to your left you have the picture
of both the hardware at the top and the

735
00:40:57,941 --> 00:40:59,050
software at the bottom.

736
00:40:59,170 --> 00:41:03,040
So the hardware at the top are of course
sees a transplant cubits that come from

737
00:41:03,041 --> 00:41:04,300
John Martinez,
his lab,

738
00:41:04,630 --> 00:41:08,530
and you see that the software on the
bottom labels them as just cubit zero in

739
00:41:08,531 --> 00:41:12,880
Cuban one. And as I apply these quantum
gates or just operations to cubits,

740
00:41:13,030 --> 00:41:16,120
you can see how that corresponds
to pulse sequences at the top.

741
00:41:16,420 --> 00:41:20,440
And this goes through and you measure out
just the expectation values that I was

742
00:41:20,441 --> 00:41:21,700
talking about over here.

743
00:41:21,850 --> 00:41:25,750
And a quantum feedback loop goes to
change our one parameter z here in the

744
00:41:25,751 --> 00:41:26,584
middle.

745
00:41:26,920 --> 00:41:31,060
So we use this kind of circuit
to study this bond association.

746
00:41:31,061 --> 00:41:35,330
So what this is a picture of is if you
take hydrogen atoms and you pull them

747
00:41:35,331 --> 00:41:38,480
apart, what's the energy? What's
the resistance to this pulling?

748
00:41:38,810 --> 00:41:42,560
And we've studied it by that algorithm
and buy another called Bayes estimation.

749
00:41:42,830 --> 00:41:46,850
What we found was that that feedback
loop really gave us something to the tune

750
00:41:46,851 --> 00:41:49,580
of a some type of
coherent error correction.

751
00:41:49,790 --> 00:41:53,870
And we feel that the smoking gun for
this was this plot that essentially took

752
00:41:54,170 --> 00:41:58,040
this problem. So this is the same problem,
but I'm only plotting the errors now.

753
00:41:58,460 --> 00:42:01,070
Uh, and the green dots, whoops,

754
00:42:01,460 --> 00:42:06,200
the green dots here are if I took
the exact solution of this problem.

755
00:42:06,201 --> 00:42:08,000
So it's relatively small at the moment,

756
00:42:08,180 --> 00:42:11,570
and I can check what the exact angle
of that z in the middle of the circuit

757
00:42:11,571 --> 00:42:15,680
should have been the CIF data.
And I plug this into my device,

758
00:42:15,681 --> 00:42:18,440
which if my device was perfect,
then this is,

759
00:42:18,560 --> 00:42:20,270
I would have gotten the exact result.

760
00:42:20,300 --> 00:42:22,790
And what we found was
these green dots instead.

761
00:42:23,120 --> 00:42:27,170
And then on the red is if you run this
kind of variational feedback loop,

762
00:42:27,440 --> 00:42:31,550
you find that the error is dropped in
some cases by over an order of magnitude

763
00:42:31,910 --> 00:42:35,090
and you get much better in
consistent results across the curve.

764
00:42:35,270 --> 00:42:38,990
And this is kind of indicative to us that
it's coming back to fix these types of

765
00:42:38,991 --> 00:42:40,250
over rotation errors.

766
00:42:40,430 --> 00:42:44,750
Because if you want to rotate by some
angle and you did it by data plus Delta,

767
00:42:44,870 --> 00:42:47,090
this is really just a
labeling error in some regard.

768
00:42:47,091 --> 00:42:50,210
What you care about is the quantum
state you've produced rather than the

769
00:42:50,211 --> 00:42:52,820
particular labels that you've
given it at the end of the day.

770
00:42:54,380 --> 00:42:59,030
So this is our, our smoking gun for this
type of a quantum error suppression.

771
00:42:59,480 --> 00:43:02,390
But we also wanted to look at
kind of generalizations to this.

772
00:43:02,391 --> 00:43:05,630
Could we tackle incoherent errors?
Could we look at other states?

773
00:43:06,020 --> 00:43:07,690
And one thing that,
uh,

774
00:43:08,090 --> 00:43:11,030
you look to when you look classically
if these types of problems,

775
00:43:11,150 --> 00:43:14,360
so I can value problems are
defined in these linear spaces.

776
00:43:14,600 --> 00:43:18,980
And what we have here is instead of
parameterization kind of explore something

777
00:43:18,981 --> 00:43:20,480
that looks a little bit nonlinear.

778
00:43:20,900 --> 00:43:25,850
So if you imagine that this
is my parameter space, this
like gray manifold here,

779
00:43:25,970 --> 00:43:29,300
and I'm walking around that
space, it looks curved. You know,

780
00:43:29,360 --> 00:43:32,990
similar to the way you might have a neural
network parameterized by some weights

781
00:43:32,991 --> 00:43:35,420
or something like that.
It's not exactly linear.

782
00:43:35,630 --> 00:43:38,570
So if you want to learn something
about the distribution and you want to

783
00:43:38,571 --> 00:43:42,140
leverage the power of Linear Algebra that
we've always used in quantum mechanics

784
00:43:42,141 --> 00:43:46,310
to tell us things like excited states,
interior eigen values. Now other things,

785
00:43:46,520 --> 00:43:49,550
you want to cast this
back into a linear space,

786
00:43:49,640 --> 00:43:52,250
but one that's relevant to the
problem that you're interested in.

787
00:43:52,670 --> 00:43:56,360
So you can imagine that it might be
possible to look at this point that you're

788
00:43:56,361 --> 00:43:59,840
at and expand,
adjust around that particular point.

789
00:43:59,841 --> 00:44:04,190
Build a little flat plane where I can do
my analysis, even though for that point,

790
00:44:04,340 --> 00:44:07,850
this is both one that I don't know much
about and can't prepare classically,

791
00:44:08,030 --> 00:44:11,480
but I can build this little flat plane
and learn something about the action of

792
00:44:11,481 --> 00:44:12,590
an operator within it.

793
00:44:13,100 --> 00:44:18,100
So what I'm going to do to do that is
I'm going to act this set of operators.

794
00:44:18,111 --> 00:44:21,560
I'll choose a set that determines my
little flat space and I'll act the

795
00:44:21,561 --> 00:44:25,040
Hamiltonian on that because these are
where the energy eigen values are coming

796
00:44:25,041 --> 00:44:28,460
from. And I'll probe with
states also within that space.

797
00:44:28,640 --> 00:44:32,280
So this will tell me how any state within
this little flat plain that I've built

798
00:44:32,520 --> 00:44:34,980
moves to another state within that space.

799
00:44:35,610 --> 00:44:39,420
And I'll do this to build a
matrix representation of that,

800
00:44:39,421 --> 00:44:43,020
which will tell me how it acts on all
of these states. Even though the states,

801
00:44:43,021 --> 00:44:45,060
I don't actually know
exactly what they are.

802
00:44:45,750 --> 00:44:48,930
And moreover I have to build some
representation of the identity,

803
00:44:48,960 --> 00:44:53,880
which is also the local metric.
But in doing so, I build
now an offline classical,

804
00:44:53,910 --> 00:44:55,710
generalized eigenvalue problem.

805
00:44:56,010 --> 00:44:58,890
So this is again a coupling
between quantum and classical.

806
00:44:59,070 --> 00:45:02,850
I've built some offline problem based
on the measurements I took on my quantum

807
00:45:02,851 --> 00:45:06,960
device to kind of improve what I could've
done without the classical computer.

808
00:45:08,280 --> 00:45:13,020
And this gives me some estimate of my
excited state energies and also something

809
00:45:13,021 --> 00:45:13,854
a little more.

810
00:45:14,940 --> 00:45:18,570
So how does this look for a real
problem kind of pictorially.

811
00:45:18,810 --> 00:45:21,480
So if you imagine that this is
the curve that I got before,

812
00:45:21,481 --> 00:45:24,870
if my hydrogen bond breaking
to him, I got it, uh, equally,

813
00:45:24,871 --> 00:45:27,180
well at each point on this curve,

814
00:45:27,390 --> 00:45:29,790
I'm going to do this
expansion that I talked about.

815
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:33,420
And this expansion only corresponds
to extra measurements on my system.

816
00:45:33,421 --> 00:45:38,010
There's no additional coherence time
required and it looks kind of like if my

817
00:45:38,011 --> 00:45:42,360
system went through this deep cohering
channel over here and I prepare the state,

818
00:45:42,390 --> 00:45:46,440
then these expansion sometimes actually
let me go outside the original set of

819
00:45:46,441 --> 00:45:51,441
states that I was able to prepare and I
solve this problem and I get out these

820
00:45:51,570 --> 00:45:53,400
excited state energy and properties.

821
00:45:53,400 --> 00:45:58,290
But what I also find is it because of
that expansion outside this kind of cone

822
00:45:58,291 --> 00:46:00,600
that I'm allowed to
occupy from decoherence,

823
00:46:00,750 --> 00:46:02,610
that I can sometimes improve the energies,

824
00:46:02,611 --> 00:46:07,370
even of my ground state and correct for
some of these quote unquote incoherent

825
00:46:07,380 --> 00:46:10,260
errors that are in my system.
And to see how this works,

826
00:46:10,261 --> 00:46:13,880
you can build a very simple one
cubit example to do this. Um,

827
00:46:13,940 --> 00:46:18,750
so if I just make some one
cubit Hamiltonian up and I
imagine too characteristic

828
00:46:18,751 --> 00:46:21,930
errors.
One is this side pure here,

829
00:46:21,931 --> 00:46:24,990
which corresponds to no matter
what angle that I give this thing,

830
00:46:24,991 --> 00:46:26,850
it always gives me back the zero state.

831
00:46:26,851 --> 00:46:29,130
So it's a nonfunctional
control essentially.

832
00:46:29,670 --> 00:46:33,480
And the other is my machine is so
bad that it gives me back zero or one

833
00:46:33,481 --> 00:46:34,530
essentially randomly.

834
00:46:35,220 --> 00:46:39,330
And this is how you define these
kinds of operators within this space.

835
00:46:39,540 --> 00:46:44,130
And I'm going to choose these sets of
operators that build my little planes. Uh,

836
00:46:44,160 --> 00:46:47,370
and the first one is the identity.
So that's just the original algorithm.

837
00:46:47,640 --> 00:46:50,550
And then in the second set I'm
going to include only bit flips.

838
00:46:50,730 --> 00:46:53,640
And then the third set are set to,
as I'm calling it,

839
00:46:53,850 --> 00:46:56,310
you do essentially full
tomography on this Cuban.

840
00:46:56,670 --> 00:47:00,210
And what you find if you look at the
error and the lowest eigen value when you

841
00:47:00,211 --> 00:47:03,480
do this,
you'll at the initial outset,

842
00:47:03,510 --> 00:47:07,350
so this is just the original unexpanded
version. You have quite bad error.

843
00:47:07,351 --> 00:47:11,850
So this is logged 10 error in the lowest
eigen value. If you add bit flips,

844
00:47:11,880 --> 00:47:16,020
you perfectly fixed this case of a
nonfunctional control and you moderately

845
00:47:16,021 --> 00:47:19,170
fixed the mixed state error.
And if you do full tomography,

846
00:47:19,171 --> 00:47:22,500
you correct both cases with just
the measurements from the device.

847
00:47:23,790 --> 00:47:27,150
So we went out and we did an
experiment based on this, uh,

848
00:47:27,151 --> 00:47:29,620
in collaboration with the
Sidiki group at Berkeley.

849
00:47:30,100 --> 00:47:33,550
And we found that if we did
both that type of expansion,

850
00:47:33,551 --> 00:47:37,300
which I'm characterizing as like
the linear response or lowest level

851
00:47:37,301 --> 00:47:40,510
expectations plus a few select
ones from the next level.

852
00:47:40,511 --> 00:47:45,460
So a few to cubit flips as well. Then
what you get out are much improved, uh,

853
00:47:45,490 --> 00:47:48,160
ground states and also the excited states.

854
00:47:48,340 --> 00:47:52,030
So the excited state curves are just
the ones you get out from these extra

855
00:47:52,031 --> 00:47:53,140
measurements that you do.

856
00:47:53,380 --> 00:47:57,010
And I'll highlight that the yellow points
down here with the larger error bars

857
00:47:57,040 --> 00:48:02,040
or the uncorrected values and the other
ones with very small error bars or what

858
00:48:02,081 --> 00:48:03,790
you got as corrections to those.

859
00:48:03,910 --> 00:48:07,780
So improved both the energies and the
spreads of the energies that we got out in

860
00:48:07,781 --> 00:48:08,614
the experiment.

861
00:48:08,830 --> 00:48:12,610
So we're very happy about this because
we feel like it's evidence that for some

862
00:48:12,611 --> 00:48:16,630
problems there are application
specific error correction modules,

863
00:48:16,631 --> 00:48:20,230
which you can consider building rather
than a general purpose error correction.

864
00:48:20,230 --> 00:48:24,850
And that quantum simulation might be a
very fruitful area for working in this.

865
00:48:25,480 --> 00:48:30,430
So I want to just kind of close with
slides saying this is an exciting time for

866
00:48:30,431 --> 00:48:31,630
quantum.
Uh,

867
00:48:31,690 --> 00:48:35,170
this is just a short picture of all of
the different companies and different

868
00:48:35,171 --> 00:48:38,650
groups and, uh, that have started
to do research in this area.

869
00:48:38,710 --> 00:48:41,920
And if you looked at this list
even save five or 10 years ago,

870
00:48:41,921 --> 00:48:44,440
it would have been not even
a fraction of this list.

871
00:48:44,650 --> 00:48:46,480
It's taking off a dramatic speed.

872
00:48:46,481 --> 00:48:49,840
We're having more and more cubits every
day that are better and more and more

873
00:48:49,841 --> 00:48:53,050
groups getting interested in our
government is finally getting on board,

874
00:48:53,260 --> 00:48:57,340
assuming that the current administration
doesn't, you know, mess things up. But,

875
00:48:58,900 --> 00:49:01,000
but I think it's an exciting
time to be in this field,

876
00:49:01,001 --> 00:49:04,620
both on algorithmics and
superconducting cubits. Um,

877
00:49:04,750 --> 00:49:08,650
I hope that I convinced you that there's
at least one key problem we're really

878
00:49:08,651 --> 00:49:12,710
driving towards that we can work on
for this. And with that I'd like to,

879
00:49:12,730 --> 00:49:17,620
to just kind of recap the things that
I've said, which are, if you go back, uh,

880
00:49:17,650 --> 00:49:19,180
what was quantum computing?

881
00:49:19,181 --> 00:49:23,890
Quantum computing was looking at these
particles while they're in this state

882
00:49:23,891 --> 00:49:26,680
that requires interference
and discrete energy levels.

883
00:49:26,980 --> 00:49:31,720
Asking what happens if we use those to
simulate other particles and what happens

884
00:49:31,721 --> 00:49:33,940
if we build a computing
abstraction on top of that.

885
00:49:34,120 --> 00:49:37,570
Can we do different or new interesting
algorithms that look nothing like their

886
00:49:37,571 --> 00:49:41,050
classical counterpart? And we saw
some examples of where that was true.

887
00:49:41,051 --> 00:49:41,651
For example,

888
00:49:41,651 --> 00:49:46,000
this linear solution of equations or
this ability to propagate Ford chemistry

889
00:49:46,001 --> 00:49:46,840
problems in time.

890
00:49:47,740 --> 00:49:51,910
I hope I convinced you that in some ways
coupling classical and quantum devices

891
00:49:52,090 --> 00:49:55,450
lets you do a little bit more than you
would have just running on the quantum

892
00:49:55,451 --> 00:49:57,160
device at least for the short term.

893
00:49:57,490 --> 00:50:00,910
So we have very well developed classical
computers and I think it's a mistake to

894
00:50:00,911 --> 00:50:03,460
cut them out of the problem
entirely at the moment.

895
00:50:03,880 --> 00:50:06,740
And that we did this interesting
expansion that I hope you're,

896
00:50:06,820 --> 00:50:11,680
you're excited about and that we're really
moving towards real problems now that

897
00:50:11,681 --> 00:50:13,600
we have devices in the pipeline.

898
00:50:13,780 --> 00:50:17,230
I think we finally exited the time of
quantum computing. When you imagine,

899
00:50:17,560 --> 00:50:17,801
you know,

900
00:50:17,801 --> 00:50:21,430
you work on algorithms with the MA in
your imagination that no device will ever

901
00:50:21,431 --> 00:50:22,210
exist.

902
00:50:22,210 --> 00:50:26,020
Now's the time to work towards real
problems and real applications and I think

903
00:50:26,021 --> 00:50:28,550
we're not that far away.
So with that,

904
00:50:28,551 --> 00:50:31,670
I'd like to thank you all for listening
and I'm happy to take any questions.

905
00:50:39,230 --> 00:50:43,250
Thanks Sarah for the nice talk.
Maybe a little addendum.

906
00:50:43,370 --> 00:50:47,610
I know you guys have been working
on a new algorithm. Um, again,

907
00:50:47,650 --> 00:50:52,430
there's a spirit of a variation, a
credit demogra Isms, but it uses,

908
00:50:52,520 --> 00:50:54,540
um, uh, well adapted basis,

909
00:50:54,550 --> 00:50:59,550
had songs that we have a chance of running
it on one of the upcoming year term

910
00:51:00,230 --> 00:51:02,090
devices.
Can you talk a little bit about that?

911
00:51:02,240 --> 00:51:06,860
Yeah, definitely. So when I talked
about originally the chemistry problem,

912
00:51:06,861 --> 00:51:10,490
I talked about how you cut that
problem up much in the same way.

913
00:51:10,491 --> 00:51:13,310
If you wanted to draw a line on a
computer you need to or ties it.

914
00:51:13,730 --> 00:51:17,280
So there's a lot of choices you
can make in that regard. And um,

915
00:51:17,660 --> 00:51:20,390
some of the ones that we've
made previously have just been,

916
00:51:20,570 --> 00:51:24,050
I guess I would say carry over were
heritage from classical computing.

917
00:51:24,290 --> 00:51:26,330
And in fact some of those
basic sets are so old,

918
00:51:26,331 --> 00:51:30,050
they were inspired by the need to do
them with a hand crank calculator.

919
00:51:30,350 --> 00:51:33,950
And so the question comes as was that
really the optimal way to slice it up,

920
00:51:34,160 --> 00:51:37,160
especially if now you're dealing with
an entirely new type of computing

921
00:51:37,161 --> 00:51:37,994
technology.

922
00:51:38,060 --> 00:51:42,180
So some work that I'd been
doing in collaboration with
Ryan Babish here has said

923
00:51:42,181 --> 00:51:43,970
that they're in fact better basis sets.

924
00:51:43,970 --> 00:51:46,970
It looked like these kind of
plain wave dual basis sets.

925
00:51:46,971 --> 00:51:50,810
And we'll have the paper out on that soon,
which make an interesting trade off.

926
00:51:50,960 --> 00:51:54,410
So the DIS discretization is
perhaps a little bit less compact,

927
00:51:54,620 --> 00:51:58,430
but the circuit depth needed to run
them as much is expected to be much,

928
00:51:58,431 --> 00:52:00,950
much smaller,
almost linear in the system size.

929
00:52:01,340 --> 00:52:04,610
And so what that means is that if you
have a device with a lot of cubits,

930
00:52:04,850 --> 00:52:08,690
but perhaps a modest gate depth
available or a modest coherence time,

931
00:52:08,900 --> 00:52:12,890
then you have a really good chance of
doing an early important problem with that

932
00:52:12,891 --> 00:52:16,340
architecture rather than one that
focuses on compacting the cubits,

933
00:52:16,460 --> 00:52:18,170
but requires a very long run time.

934
00:52:18,500 --> 00:52:21,740
And I think that's got a good opportunity
to be one of the first applications

935
00:52:21,741 --> 00:52:23,510
that runs on one of these real devices.

936
00:52:24,470 --> 00:52:25,140
Okay.

937
00:52:25,140 --> 00:52:28,400
So at the end here you
mentioned, uh, the, your,

938
00:52:28,401 --> 00:52:31,500
your feeling that we shouldn't sort
of cut classical computers out of the

939
00:52:31,501 --> 00:52:35,430
picture and we should develop some way
of using classical computers and quantum

940
00:52:35,431 --> 00:52:37,830
computers together.
So here at Google,

941
00:52:37,831 --> 00:52:40,680
a obviously one of our
strengths is machine learning.

942
00:52:41,100 --> 00:52:45,330
And there are even some people at Google
on the Google accelerated sciences team

943
00:52:45,540 --> 00:52:49,590
who are actively thinking about how they
can use machine learning to accelerate,

944
00:52:49,591 --> 00:52:54,210
say, electronic structure calculations.
So my question for you is, um,

945
00:52:54,630 --> 00:52:56,670
you know,
do you think that there is any role that,

946
00:52:56,671 --> 00:53:01,671
say neural networks and sophisticated
machine learning can play to accelerate,

947
00:53:01,770 --> 00:53:04,910
uh, quantum approaches to
electronic structure? You, sir,

948
00:53:04,920 --> 00:53:09,380
any sort of interplay between say the
variational algorithm and, you know,

949
00:53:09,390 --> 00:53:12,690
machine learning paradigms
that might be interesting.

950
00:53:13,230 --> 00:53:16,740
Yeah, so I think there's a
lot of interplay that you
get that can happen here.

951
00:53:16,741 --> 00:53:20,610
And one of the one interesting connection
is of course that neural networks

952
00:53:20,611 --> 00:53:23,370
don't look so different from
certain types of quantum circuits,

953
00:53:23,371 --> 00:53:24,250
but that's kind of a,

954
00:53:24,710 --> 00:53:28,800
a different topic than using a classical
neural network to accelerate this type

955
00:53:28,801 --> 00:53:32,850
of computation. And so for example,
some areas that I could see these,

956
00:53:33,030 --> 00:53:36,990
these being beneficial in is perhaps even
choosing the basis set that you might

957
00:53:36,991 --> 00:53:37,741
be interested in.

958
00:53:37,741 --> 00:53:41,670
You might be able to learn what disc
realizations are best for a particular

959
00:53:41,671 --> 00:53:45,000
problem.
You might be able to optimize kind of the,

960
00:53:45,660 --> 00:53:49,050
the search procedure of this
particular problem. So, for example,

961
00:53:49,051 --> 00:53:53,970
I did that subspace expansion at the end,
which told me something about this, uh,

962
00:53:53,971 --> 00:53:56,850
this excited states that are
nearby this ground state.

963
00:53:57,060 --> 00:54:00,600
So I can imagine that a neural network
might be able to learn a different

964
00:54:00,601 --> 00:54:02,100
optimal set of operators,

965
00:54:02,250 --> 00:54:06,480
which corrects both for which not only
looks at the excited states but also

966
00:54:06,481 --> 00:54:09,630
hopefully learn something about the
errors in my real physical system.

967
00:54:09,870 --> 00:54:12,090
Cause if you can create just
the right perturbations,

968
00:54:12,091 --> 00:54:15,000
you can reduce the air quite a
bit in that particular model.

969
00:54:15,270 --> 00:54:20,050
So I think there's a wealth of
unexplored areas as to how Quanah, uh,

970
00:54:20,190 --> 00:54:23,610
say classical machine learning could
hook up to a real quantum experiment,

971
00:54:23,790 --> 00:54:27,900
especially ones with classical feedback
loops in both kind of accelerate it and

972
00:54:27,901 --> 00:54:30,480
push it forward to new levels
that we haven't seen before.

973
00:54:30,850 --> 00:54:33,280
So I have a question about the cubits,
the actual numbers.

974
00:54:33,281 --> 00:54:36,900
So you hear companies like IBM, they
say they have 16 cubic computers yeah.

975
00:54:37,120 --> 00:54:39,580
In DYF has thousand cubic computers.

976
00:54:40,450 --> 00:54:43,540
I guess all cubits are not the same
or how do these numbers compare?

977
00:54:43,820 --> 00:54:44,061
Yeah.

978
00:54:44,061 --> 00:54:47,390
So there's a lot of important facts that
you have to consider when you look at

979
00:54:47,391 --> 00:54:51,710
comparisons on number of cubits. In
fact, I think IBM has even started, uh,

980
00:54:51,800 --> 00:54:55,940
proposing some metric that
includes both the cubit number, uh,

981
00:54:55,941 --> 00:54:59,510
and their coherence time and the quality
of operations that you can perform on

982
00:54:59,511 --> 00:55:02,860
it. I think they call it
the quantum volume. Uh, so,

983
00:55:02,930 --> 00:55:06,860
and what that really captures is that
it's important to look at a lot of other

984
00:55:06,861 --> 00:55:11,500
factors as well. For example, some
machines don't have arbitrary couplings.

985
00:55:11,501 --> 00:55:15,590
So even if you wanted to solve certain
problems on say the thousand or 2000

986
00:55:15,591 --> 00:55:19,130
cubits that you have, you just cannot
fit that problem into your device.

987
00:55:19,520 --> 00:55:23,930
And so it's important to look
at both the co cubit number,

988
00:55:23,931 --> 00:55:26,090
the coherence time,
their connectivity,

989
00:55:26,300 --> 00:55:30,170
and all of these other factors when
comparing across the this regime.

990
00:55:30,171 --> 00:55:33,020
And I think by introducing
something like quantum volume,

991
00:55:33,021 --> 00:55:35,420
I think IBM started a
good trend in that regard.

992
00:55:35,630 --> 00:55:39,530
And we need more evaluations of that
metric and developments on that metric and

993
00:55:39,531 --> 00:55:41,540
free people to actually
report what that metric.

994
00:55:41,541 --> 00:55:44,770
So we can do comparisons to say
this quantum device, you know,

995
00:55:44,930 --> 00:55:48,560
it outperforms this one in some
meaningful way. So it's a good question.

996
00:55:49,210 --> 00:55:50,043
Okay.

997
00:55:50,290 --> 00:55:53,650
Slightly going a little
further. A field here. Uh,

998
00:55:54,100 --> 00:55:56,830
I don't know if people are interested
in this or not, but I was wondering, so,

999
00:55:57,070 --> 00:56:00,580
so there are all these like different
interpretations of quantum mechanics,

1000
00:56:00,581 --> 00:56:02,530
right? Which are sort
of, as far as I know,

1001
00:56:02,531 --> 00:56:05,650
they're all observationally the same
that I've heard some people claim that

1002
00:56:05,651 --> 00:56:07,360
maybe some of them aren't.
Exactly.

1003
00:56:07,361 --> 00:56:11,530
But for a first approximation there
obvious observationally the same, right?

1004
00:56:11,531 --> 00:56:14,530
So you've got the Copenhagen,
you've got many worlds,

1005
00:56:14,531 --> 00:56:18,430
you've got the wheel or transactional
interpretation. I'm wondering is,

1006
00:56:18,670 --> 00:56:22,720
is there one of these that
sort of more fruitful,

1007
00:56:22,721 --> 00:56:26,830
more perspicacious for thinking about
quantum computing than the others?

1008
00:56:26,831 --> 00:56:29,860
Is there as opposed to like
just your personal preference,

1009
00:56:29,861 --> 00:56:34,630
is there one that that you make progress
better if you think of it that way?

1010
00:56:35,380 --> 00:56:39,310
So I have to admit that I'm not a leading
expert on kind of what I would call

1011
00:56:39,311 --> 00:56:41,680
quantum fundamentals or interpretations.

1012
00:56:42,010 --> 00:56:46,750
And I know many people make arguments in
terms of say the many worlds theory for

1013
00:56:46,810 --> 00:56:47,050
you know,

1014
00:56:47,050 --> 00:56:51,160
the super position overall inputs and
you need all of the many worlds to come

1015
00:56:51,161 --> 00:56:53,110
together and agree in just the right way.

1016
00:56:54,100 --> 00:56:58,990
I personally haven't really delved deeply
into which interpretations aid in the

1017
00:56:59,170 --> 00:57:01,780
kind of development of algorithms.
I've always,

1018
00:57:01,900 --> 00:57:05,020
I guess prescribed to this
Copenhagen argument that, you know,

1019
00:57:05,021 --> 00:57:08,560
you can build a model that predicts
how the hands on a clock move,

1020
00:57:08,620 --> 00:57:11,680
but that might not tell you anything
about how the gears are constructed behind

1021
00:57:11,681 --> 00:57:15,730
it. So I, yeah, I don't think I have
a great answer for your question

1022
00:57:15,820 --> 00:57:18,550
because I mean it sounds like you were
saying with this Scott Aaronson cartoon,

1023
00:57:18,551 --> 00:57:22,600
right? So, so the, the idea that, that,
that these things are massively parallel.

1024
00:57:22,780 --> 00:57:26,670
It's not exactly right, but it's not
exactly wrong. Yeah, that's right. Yeah.

1025
00:57:26,730 --> 00:57:31,450
And the, the mini worlds kind of Wa
it seems like it's the natural way of,

1026
00:57:31,690 --> 00:57:33,190
of thinking of it as parallel,

1027
00:57:33,191 --> 00:57:36,370
but maybe it makes it too easy to
think of it as bad. I don't know.

1028
00:57:37,180 --> 00:57:38,270
Yeah. It's certainly, well,

1029
00:57:38,360 --> 00:57:42,180
the many worlds is certainly
the most exciting from a
science fiction standpoint.

1030
00:57:43,230 --> 00:57:46,440
I've always liked it for that reason,
but in terms of interpretation,

1031
00:57:46,800 --> 00:57:48,870
I agree that it has
many appealing aspects,

1032
00:57:48,871 --> 00:57:50,880
at least in terms of
computations agreeing,

1033
00:57:50,881 --> 00:57:54,570
but it's hard as to like the
specifics of your question.

1034
00:57:54,571 --> 00:57:58,030
I've never found one more helpful than
the other for constructing an algorithm.

1035
00:57:58,200 --> 00:57:59,400
Okay,
sure.
