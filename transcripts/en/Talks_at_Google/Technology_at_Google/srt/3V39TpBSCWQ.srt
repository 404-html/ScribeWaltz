1
00:00:06,550 --> 00:00:09,040
Hi, I'm Jimmy. I won't waste too
much of your time by being up here.

2
00:00:09,041 --> 00:00:12,280
I'm just here to introduce
Brian hosts of tech meetups.

3
00:00:12,281 --> 00:00:16,960
Ride home podcast recently wrote a book
called how the Internet happened from

4
00:00:16,961 --> 00:00:18,540
Netscape to the iPhone.
Um,

5
00:00:19,090 --> 00:00:23,440
Brian's got a history of working
in the tech industry and startups.

6
00:00:23,441 --> 00:00:24,850
He'll talk more about that,

7
00:00:25,030 --> 00:00:27,910
but essentially a amassed a whole lot
of knowledge about the history of the

8
00:00:27,911 --> 00:00:32,110
Internet and wrote this book in his own
words cause no one else had. And uh,

9
00:00:32,140 --> 00:00:34,900
we'll share a lot of interesting things
that he learned a lot along the way with

10
00:00:34,901 --> 00:00:35,734
us.
Um,

11
00:00:36,190 --> 00:00:40,120
I'll also just note that there are books
for sale as usual with these things at

12
00:00:40,121 --> 00:00:43,720
these subsidized price for Googlers. So
feel free to pick one up on your way out.

13
00:00:43,750 --> 00:00:45,340
And with that,
Brian McCullough.

14
00:00:48,760 --> 00:00:49,593
Okay.

15
00:00:50,180 --> 00:00:51,170
Thank you.
Jimmy.

16
00:00:51,770 --> 00:00:56,240
I'm gonna stand up here so I can
quote from the book once or twice.

17
00:00:56,840 --> 00:01:01,310
Uh, thank you all for coming and
thanks Google for having me dumb. Um,

18
00:01:01,790 --> 00:01:04,220
as Jimmy said,
uh,

19
00:01:04,490 --> 00:01:08,520
I'm actually not a historian or a
writer. This is my first book. Um,

20
00:01:08,540 --> 00:01:13,070
I'm a three time a web founder.
Actually, funny enough,

21
00:01:13,130 --> 00:01:17,610
my eye, I've said this on many of
my podcasts. My first company, uh,

22
00:01:17,690 --> 00:01:20,300
I found it in [inaudible]
99 I've said many times,

23
00:01:20,301 --> 00:01:23,730
was 100% built on Edwards,
um,

24
00:01:23,780 --> 00:01:26,870
back in the day when it was still
useful and not filled with spam.

25
00:01:26,871 --> 00:01:29,150
But I in my memory,
um,

26
00:01:29,210 --> 00:01:34,210
the day that y'all opened it up for the
self serve thing is that the day that I

27
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:36,950
got on ad words and God,

28
00:01:36,951 --> 00:01:40,340
I can remember paying 8 cents a click
for the keyword resume and things like

29
00:01:40,341 --> 00:01:45,140
that is not any times. But, um, so
the reason that I did this book,

30
00:01:45,800 --> 00:01:50,580
my second startup was
2002, my third, 2005. Um,

31
00:01:50,810 --> 00:01:54,440
it just sort of bothered me that
there's excellent books of course,

32
00:01:54,441 --> 00:01:57,680
about the history of the
arpanet and things like that,

33
00:01:57,681 --> 00:02:02,681
but the actual internet going mainstream
and entering normal people's lives,

34
00:02:03,130 --> 00:02:07,310
um, no one had done. And I just got
tired of no one writing that book.

35
00:02:07,340 --> 00:02:10,550
So like any other startup I've done, I was
like, well, someone's going to do that.

36
00:02:10,551 --> 00:02:14,780
Why not me? It's the dumb
startup mentality. Um,

37
00:02:15,530 --> 00:02:19,880
so the reason I give you
that background is, uh,

38
00:02:19,940 --> 00:02:22,940
it's also sort of my career.
It's what I lived.

39
00:02:23,270 --> 00:02:25,220
So I thought it would be easy to do.

40
00:02:25,580 --> 00:02:29,660
And so what I want to do in this talk is
tell you some of the fun things that I

41
00:02:29,661 --> 00:02:33,530
learned in doing the research. It was
five years of writing essentially. Um,

42
00:02:33,531 --> 00:02:38,300
and I did actual go to the library and
find a defunct magazines and things like

43
00:02:38,330 --> 00:02:42,200
real research also, by
the way. Um, it also,

44
00:02:42,440 --> 00:02:46,520
because I'm a web guy and I'm used to
instant gratification over the course of

45
00:02:46,521 --> 00:02:48,680
the writing.
I launched the Internet history podcast,

46
00:02:49,370 --> 00:02:50,900
which there's almost 200 episodes now,

47
00:02:50,901 --> 00:02:55,620
which was me doing interviews for
primary sources. I just had, um,

48
00:02:55,700 --> 00:02:58,880
just this week, Ken Norton of Gv, uh,

49
00:02:59,140 --> 00:03:02,740
last month we had Matt Cutts.
Um, I've had Charlotte airs on,

50
00:03:02,741 --> 00:03:06,010
so there's plenty of Googlers that had
been on the show if you want to check

51
00:03:06,011 --> 00:03:10,210
that out. Um, but the reason I give
you that background is like I said,

52
00:03:10,211 --> 00:03:12,740
I just want to go through and,
um,

53
00:03:13,090 --> 00:03:16,150
sort of chronologically and tell you
some of the things that even though I

54
00:03:16,151 --> 00:03:18,550
thought I knew all this
stuff because I lived it,

55
00:03:19,110 --> 00:03:23,530
that were sort of surprising to me.
What has been surprising to me as I do,

56
00:03:24,380 --> 00:03:26,480
um, media hits, um,

57
00:03:26,770 --> 00:03:30,730
for this book is it's they
almost can't help themselves.

58
00:03:31,210 --> 00:03:32,350
The first question,

59
00:03:32,380 --> 00:03:36,160
especially on radio is always I
thought Al Gore invented the Internet.

60
00:03:36,790 --> 00:03:40,120
So I have come up,
fortunately it's in the book.

61
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:43,210
I have a pat answer for that.
Um,

62
00:03:43,720 --> 00:03:47,290
in 1992 or actually 1991,

63
00:03:47,320 --> 00:03:50,320
there was a bill pass called the
high performance computing act,

64
00:03:50,830 --> 00:03:55,590
which was a colloquially
known as the Gore Bill. Um,

65
00:03:55,810 --> 00:03:59,380
and it funded a bunch
of a super supercomputer
facilities around the country,

66
00:03:59,770 --> 00:04:01,480
one of which was the NCSA,

67
00:04:01,870 --> 00:04:04,300
which is where mosaic the
mosaic web browser came out of,

68
00:04:04,630 --> 00:04:06,700
which was where Marc
Andreessen was going to school,

69
00:04:06,970 --> 00:04:11,210
which was where all the mosaic kids
that would later found Netscape, um,

70
00:04:11,230 --> 00:04:14,890
all went to school. Um, and
so as I say in the book,

71
00:04:15,130 --> 00:04:20,130
essentially when they were being paid $6
an hour to code in the basement of the

72
00:04:20,591 --> 00:04:22,240
NCSA at the University of Illinois,

73
00:04:22,510 --> 00:04:25,870
they were being paid
by Al Gore's a Gerbil.

74
00:04:26,380 --> 00:04:28,330
So it's not exactly apples to apples,

75
00:04:28,331 --> 00:04:32,180
but in a way you could say that
that played a major role and, um,

76
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:36,020
the Internet going mainstream because
as I make the argument in the book, um,

77
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:41,320
Netscape was the first true.com or web
company as we would think of it today.

78
00:04:42,100 --> 00:04:45,130
So let's begin there actually,

79
00:04:45,220 --> 00:04:50,220
because there's a million reasons why I
think Netscape was the big bang for the

80
00:04:50,741 --> 00:04:52,690
modern era,
as I call it in the book,

81
00:04:53,590 --> 00:04:56,800
not the least of which is the culture.

82
00:04:57,120 --> 00:04:58,750
So when I started researching,

83
00:04:58,751 --> 00:05:03,670
the reason that I threw it up as a podcast
is I worked my way through the entire

84
00:05:03,700 --> 00:05:08,700
mosaic engineering team that went out to
California to found Netscape and sands.

85
00:05:09,461 --> 00:05:14,020
Marc Andreessen, who even though we talk
on Twitter, refuses to come on the show.

86
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:15,220
But,
um,

87
00:05:15,760 --> 00:05:20,760
the thing that I found fascinating was
this idea of startup culture and how a

88
00:05:22,481 --> 00:05:27,481
lot of it was born by the media attention
that Netscape got when it IPO in 1995,

89
00:05:28,660 --> 00:05:32,620
which we'll get to in a
second. Um, to a person,

90
00:05:33,100 --> 00:05:38,100
all of the mosaic slash Netscape engineers
almost unbidden by me wanting to make

91
00:05:39,371 --> 00:05:43,690
the point that they're like this
sort of, you know, work hard,

92
00:05:43,691 --> 00:05:48,691
sleep under your desk party hard sort of
startup culture that like we didn't do

93
00:05:49,571 --> 00:05:52,840
that. The media did that to us. Um,

94
00:05:53,230 --> 00:05:58,220
they really were the original mosaic
six that went out to found Netscape with

95
00:05:58,221 --> 00:05:59,510
Marc Andreessen and Jim Clark.

96
00:05:59,900 --> 00:06:04,490
These were literal corn fed midwesterners
fresh out of college, 22, 23,

97
00:06:04,491 --> 00:06:05,324
24.

98
00:06:05,660 --> 00:06:10,280
And so as I'm Alex Topic
told me in the book,

99
00:06:10,850 --> 00:06:11,690
and I'm quoting him,

100
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:15,230
we were working around the clock because
that's what you used to do before four

101
00:06:15,231 --> 00:06:16,340
years later,
five years later,

102
00:06:16,341 --> 00:06:18,440
the entire value would be
living the same lifestyle,

103
00:06:18,890 --> 00:06:20,990
but those people actually have lives.

104
00:06:21,290 --> 00:06:23,150
We really didn't have any
lives outside of the office.

105
00:06:23,151 --> 00:06:25,070
So of course we are going to be at
the office all the time. I mean,

106
00:06:25,100 --> 00:06:27,080
I had no furniture.
Why should I ever go home?

107
00:06:27,980 --> 00:06:32,360
And Lumon Tooley who some of you
might know, um, said the press,

108
00:06:32,361 --> 00:06:33,950
just take what they think is interesting,

109
00:06:33,951 --> 00:06:36,720
juicy and fascinating out of their
limited time. And they publicize that.

110
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:40,790
And especially post Netscape in 98 99
every startup is trained to do the things

111
00:06:40,791 --> 00:06:42,920
that they read about in the
magazines that they read about us.

112
00:06:43,490 --> 00:06:45,650
I would catch four or five hours
of sleep at the office, wake up,

113
00:06:45,651 --> 00:06:47,330
do another 20 go home, blah,
blah, blah, blah, blah.

114
00:06:47,900 --> 00:06:51,380
But I wouldn't recommend doing that for
your average startup. Unfortunately,

115
00:06:51,410 --> 00:06:54,260
a lot of startup people think that that's
the way it should be done because of

116
00:06:54,261 --> 00:06:55,700
all the publicity that we had.

117
00:06:57,680 --> 00:07:02,680
Another point that I make in the book is
that Netscape was the Big Bang because

118
00:07:04,250 --> 00:07:09,250
the Rock Star Entrepreneur
Universe that we live in,

119
00:07:10,010 --> 00:07:14,420
if you were around in the eighties and
early nineties that wasn't a thing.

120
00:07:15,020 --> 00:07:19,700
Kids grew up to want to be rock stars and,
and sports heroes.

121
00:07:19,701 --> 00:07:21,950
And maybe if you were super ambitious,
he went to Wall Street,

122
00:07:21,951 --> 00:07:26,951
but the idea that you would start a
company that was not in the Zeitgeists,

123
00:07:29,660 --> 00:07:30,230
um,

124
00:07:30,230 --> 00:07:35,230
and the fact that Netscape had
this famous Ipo in 1995 that made,

125
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:38,690
I actually remember clearly it made
the nightly news and things like that.

126
00:07:39,050 --> 00:07:40,970
The idea that there was a new company,

127
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:45,380
that there was a company that had been
around for 18 months that had no profits,

128
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:49,160
that was worth $2 billion
on the Davids Ipo.

129
00:07:49,970 --> 00:07:54,350
I interviewed Wall Street people. It
blew their minds at the time too. Um,

130
00:07:54,410 --> 00:07:56,330
so,
uh,

131
00:07:56,600 --> 00:08:01,400
I devote the entire first chapter to
telling the Netscape story because of some

132
00:08:01,401 --> 00:08:02,211
of the things,

133
00:08:02,211 --> 00:08:07,211
the groundwork that it laid for this era
that we've been living in ever since,

134
00:08:07,281 --> 00:08:09,490
essentially the last 25 years.
Um,

135
00:08:10,670 --> 00:08:13,730
back to their sort of work
hard play hard culture.

136
00:08:13,731 --> 00:08:17,000
The other thing that Netscape did,
and you know,

137
00:08:17,540 --> 00:08:20,840
this is obvious when it you stayed at,
but think of how conceptually,

138
00:08:21,290 --> 00:08:22,430
what a leap this was.

139
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:28,120
These were the first guys
to have a product where you
would distribute it on the

140
00:08:28,251 --> 00:08:30,800
internet. Like, literally before them,

141
00:08:30,830 --> 00:08:35,030
you would still put software in boxes,
shrink wrap it and put it on a shelf.

142
00:08:35,180 --> 00:08:35,900
Right?

143
00:08:35,900 --> 00:08:40,900
So this concept of doing versions that
you get feedback from your users and you

144
00:08:42,801 --> 00:08:46,910
do, you put out a dot, whatever release
two weeks later, another release.

145
00:08:47,390 --> 00:08:52,390
So one of the reasons obviously
that we now live in this,

146
00:08:52,780 --> 00:08:53,180
you know,

147
00:08:53,180 --> 00:08:58,180
24 seven product cycle is because they
were the first people to jump on that

148
00:08:59,521 --> 00:09:04,521
sort of a distribution mechanism
as a way to do software products.

149
00:09:05,430 --> 00:09:09,390
But also because, uh, like
everyone else at the time,

150
00:09:09,391 --> 00:09:12,810
this is 1995 they were
out racing Bill Gates.

151
00:09:13,410 --> 00:09:17,460
And so another thing that I was surprised
when I did the research, because again,

152
00:09:18,150 --> 00:09:21,660
in a most of my career was spent in the,
in the aughts,

153
00:09:21,840 --> 00:09:24,990
and God bless them, no offense,
Microsoft, but they were, you know,

154
00:09:24,991 --> 00:09:29,991
they'd been in a sort of last decade in
the two thousands it was br surprising

155
00:09:31,231 --> 00:09:36,231
reminder to me how much everything in
the 90s what everyone was doing was in

156
00:09:36,451 --> 00:09:40,230
relation to what Microsoft
might do or try to standard.

157
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:43,530
Googlers have told me on the
Internet history podcast, you know,

158
00:09:43,560 --> 00:09:47,790
when bad words finally took off
and were making buttloads of money,

159
00:09:48,030 --> 00:09:51,420
it was a thing.
Don't tell anybody,

160
00:09:51,421 --> 00:09:56,421
don't let the word get out until we're
far enough along that gates can't catch

161
00:09:56,911 --> 00:10:01,200
us essentially. So that was
surprising to me. How much, um,

162
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:05,820
in the first few chapters,
if Microsoft constantly comes up,

163
00:10:06,580 --> 00:10:07,413
um,

164
00:10:07,800 --> 00:10:12,800
I go into in depth how bill
gates got internet religion.

165
00:10:13,290 --> 00:10:14,910
I talked to a bunch of Microsoft people.

166
00:10:15,090 --> 00:10:16,890
It was really very much
a generational thing.

167
00:10:16,891 --> 00:10:21,060
It was the guys at Microsoft in their
late twenties and early thirties who had

168
00:10:21,061 --> 00:10:25,080
used the internet in college. Not
that Bill Gates hadn't. In fact,

169
00:10:25,110 --> 00:10:27,060
he and Paul Allen had a,
you know,

170
00:10:27,090 --> 00:10:30,210
when they were writing their first
software products had had, we're using,

171
00:10:30,211 --> 00:10:31,800
because they were on opposite
sides of the country.

172
00:10:31,801 --> 00:10:33,120
So they were FTP back together.

173
00:10:33,570 --> 00:10:38,570
It was more generational in the sense
that a guy like gates born in 55 baby

174
00:10:39,961 --> 00:10:43,350
boomer as much as he was,
he loved computers.

175
00:10:43,351 --> 00:10:48,351
He really didn't believe that
computers were mainstream enough.

176
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:51,540
If you guys remember things like Web
TV and stuff like that that they did.

177
00:10:51,870 --> 00:10:54,060
And if you remember a term like
the information super highway,

178
00:10:54,780 --> 00:10:57,150
which people think, well
that was the internet. No,

179
00:10:57,151 --> 00:11:00,870
they had a vision that they were
going to deliver once broadband became

180
00:11:00,990 --> 00:11:03,660
ubiquitous, which gates figured
would happen after the year 2000,

181
00:11:03,661 --> 00:11:05,400
which he was 100% right,

182
00:11:05,970 --> 00:11:10,320
then they would deliver this curated
Microsoft safe for the masses,

183
00:11:10,820 --> 00:11:11,653
um,

184
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:16,620
interconnected computing product via
the TV because the TV was the one thing.

185
00:11:16,650 --> 00:11:21,240
It wasn't until 1998 or 99.
Don't quote me on that, that,

186
00:11:21,270 --> 00:11:25,800
um, computers, uh, penetrated
50% of us households.

187
00:11:26,400 --> 00:11:29,010
So again,
if you're Bill Gates in 94 95,

188
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:32,850
you're not worried about the internet
because it's not going to ever be

189
00:11:32,851 --> 00:11:36,450
mainstream. It's not good enough
because it's not broad band.

190
00:11:36,451 --> 00:11:37,800
You can't do movies and things like that.

191
00:11:38,430 --> 00:11:43,430
The thing that he missed was that it
was good enough and people were excited

192
00:11:44,011 --> 00:11:48,360
about it and we're willing to put up
with it takes two minutes to download a

193
00:11:48,361 --> 00:11:50,520
jpeg or something like that.
Um,

194
00:11:50,940 --> 00:11:55,940
so I want to give credit the
people like Brad Silverberg and um,

195
00:11:57,400 --> 00:12:00,070
uh, Slivka, I can't
remember his first name,

196
00:12:00,620 --> 00:12:05,620
the younger guys that had to do sort
of the generational push to the older

197
00:12:06,580 --> 00:12:08,020
people at Microsoft to say like,

198
00:12:08,050 --> 00:12:12,400
this is really happening and
we got to jump on board. Um,

199
00:12:13,810 --> 00:12:16,390
another reason that I did this book is,
you know,

200
00:12:16,391 --> 00:12:20,530
I still dabble in a little bit of
angel investing and things like that.

201
00:12:20,531 --> 00:12:24,850
And when I meet with,
you know, young people,

202
00:12:25,300 --> 00:12:28,000
young founders, 26, 27 and they say, Oh,

203
00:12:28,001 --> 00:12:30,850
you remember the.com you were there for
the back, come here. What was that like?

204
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:34,720
Or when I've done episodes on AOL,
when they,

205
00:12:34,810 --> 00:12:37,060
I get emails and tweets saying,
thank you.

206
00:12:37,061 --> 00:12:40,240
I'd never really understood what
AOL business model even was,

207
00:12:40,750 --> 00:12:44,490
which I get if the Internet's
just always been in the ether. Um,

208
00:12:46,030 --> 00:12:51,030
AOL was always pejoratively called
the training wheels for the Internet,

209
00:12:52,450 --> 00:12:56,080
but I argue in the book that
was incredibly valuable.

210
00:12:57,040 --> 00:12:59,050
Somebody needed to be the training wheels.

211
00:12:59,230 --> 00:13:02,920
This book is very much
about how the Internet went
mainstream to people like our

212
00:13:02,921 --> 00:13:07,510
parents. Um, and many,

213
00:13:07,511 --> 00:13:08,860
many Americans at some point,

214
00:13:08,861 --> 00:13:13,600
something like 70% of all internet
traffic in the US was going through AOL

215
00:13:13,650 --> 00:13:14,483
pipes.

216
00:13:14,770 --> 00:13:19,240
So many people got their first taste
of not only the web and the Internet,

217
00:13:19,241 --> 00:13:21,910
but computing and like living online,

218
00:13:22,450 --> 00:13:27,450
learning what it means to have an online
persona and a screen name and you can,

219
00:13:27,640 --> 00:13:32,640
that can mean going into the chat rooms
and talking sexy chat and stuff like

220
00:13:32,651 --> 00:13:34,150
that. But also, you know,

221
00:13:34,151 --> 00:13:38,230
finding those little areas of the
Internet where your interests are,

222
00:13:38,231 --> 00:13:43,140
where your people are,
your thing. So, um, the uh,

223
00:13:43,270 --> 00:13:46,690
I spent a long time talking about
AOL, giving them credit. I uh,

224
00:13:47,080 --> 00:13:52,080
interviewed Jim Brandt who was the
marketing guru behind if you were alive.

225
00:13:52,421 --> 00:13:55,840
Then there was a time when you
couldn't open a magazine. You couldn't,

226
00:13:55,870 --> 00:13:58,660
they put him on sports stadiums,
they put them in Omaha steaks.

227
00:13:58,661 --> 00:14:02,460
You couldn't go anywhere
without getting a free AOL disk.

228
00:14:03,320 --> 00:14:07,660
Um, originally dis and
eventually CD roms. Uh, her,

229
00:14:07,661 --> 00:14:12,370
her brilliant insight
was, again, this is 95,

230
00:14:12,371 --> 00:14:17,020
96. Um, computers are only
in 30, 40% of households.

231
00:14:18,010 --> 00:14:21,460
She had the choice of this is a product
that no one understands and either I

232
00:14:21,461 --> 00:14:25,870
have to spend all of my marketing time
educating people on what it means to go

233
00:14:25,871 --> 00:14:28,180
online and what you can do and
why you would even want to do it.

234
00:14:28,540 --> 00:14:31,990
She told me that they would have,
um,

235
00:14:33,130 --> 00:14:33,963
when you call it,
you know,

236
00:14:34,440 --> 00:14:37,090
they're behind the mirror and
they're having consumers, right?

237
00:14:37,091 --> 00:14:38,290
We're focus groups and things like that.

238
00:14:38,680 --> 00:14:40,510
And people would sit
in front of a computer,

239
00:14:40,511 --> 00:14:42,550
take the mouse and put it on the floor.

240
00:14:42,551 --> 00:14:44,740
Cause I think it's like a sewing
machine pedal and things like that.

241
00:14:45,610 --> 00:14:50,290
So her insight is, forget that.
I just need them to try it.

242
00:14:50,770 --> 00:14:55,520
That's it. So if I can just get these
discs so that they're cluttering,

243
00:14:55,521 --> 00:14:57,680
they're collecting and
corners like tumbleweeds.

244
00:14:58,070 --> 00:15:00,620
If I can just get somebody to put
this in their computer one time,

245
00:15:01,790 --> 00:15:03,050
I don't have to educate them.

246
00:15:03,080 --> 00:15:07,430
They'll figure out what is useful
to them about this product.

247
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:08,690
Um,

248
00:15:08,690 --> 00:15:11,960
so it's gone down in history as one of
the greatest marketing campaigns of all

249
00:15:11,961 --> 00:15:14,690
time. Um, when she started that campaign,

250
00:15:14,691 --> 00:15:17,480
I think AOL had less
than 400,000 subscribers.

251
00:15:17,900 --> 00:15:22,290
Obviously at it's height it had 30
million. So all credit to Jan Brant.

252
00:15:22,750 --> 00:15:25,090
Um,
I also give a lot of credit to,

253
00:15:25,091 --> 00:15:30,091
to Yahoo for being what I call
the first great a web company,

254
00:15:30,531 --> 00:15:34,130
the first great company that couldn't
have existed without the Internet because

255
00:15:34,131 --> 00:15:37,370
you can argue that Netscape with a web
browser that's still a software product,

256
00:15:38,060 --> 00:15:42,590
but um, you know, Yahoo, even though
it wasn't technically a search engine,

257
00:15:42,591 --> 00:15:45,170
it was a human curated directory,

258
00:15:45,560 --> 00:15:49,790
but they essentially did search for
most people at the very beginning. Um,

259
00:15:51,050 --> 00:15:54,230
the, uh, I look at Amazon,

260
00:15:55,790 --> 00:16:00,790
the thing that I found fascinating about
Amazon is that so many of the stories

261
00:16:01,911 --> 00:16:06,911
that I'm telling in this book are
about the leaders that go first,

262
00:16:07,310 --> 00:16:11,150
get all the arrows in their back and
then someone comes behind them. You know,

263
00:16:11,151 --> 00:16:13,910
it's first there was six degrees
than there was friends there.

264
00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:16,220
Then there was my space and
then Facebook, blah, blah, blah.

265
00:16:17,760 --> 00:16:22,760
It's the only major example that I can
think of of any category in the modern

266
00:16:24,171 --> 00:16:26,290
tech era where the,
the,

267
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:31,320
the major leader that came out first is
still the undisputed 800 pound gorilla

268
00:16:32,001 --> 00:16:34,340
in its space.
And obviously they were not,

269
00:16:34,400 --> 00:16:36,920
Amazon was not the first
people to do ecommerce online.

270
00:16:37,010 --> 00:16:38,900
They weren't even the first
people to sell books online.

271
00:16:39,470 --> 00:16:44,470
But the fact that they were the first
people to popularize ecommerce and that

272
00:16:47,031 --> 00:16:50,640
they're still the ones that
are killing it today, um,

273
00:16:50,960 --> 00:16:53,600
is that's the thing
that's the most amazing,

274
00:16:53,690 --> 00:16:57,200
if you look at it from a certain
perspective. And again, I mentioned that,

275
00:16:57,201 --> 00:17:02,120
you know, I went to the library to
look up old issues of Forbes and,

276
00:17:02,270 --> 00:17:06,530
but also things like industry standard
and magazines that haven't existed for 20

277
00:17:06,531 --> 00:17:07,364
years.

278
00:17:07,580 --> 00:17:12,580
It was amazing to me how late you would
still get articles about are we ever

279
00:17:13,041 --> 00:17:15,380
going to be able to convince
consumers to buy online?

280
00:17:15,950 --> 00:17:18,710
Are we ever going to be able to convince
consumers to put their credit cards

281
00:17:18,711 --> 00:17:22,220
online? I'm talking about
as late as Christmas of 98.

282
00:17:22,520 --> 00:17:26,750
Christmas of [inaudible] 99 was really
kind of thought of is like, well,

283
00:17:26,751 --> 00:17:30,390
this is finally when Americans,
uh,

284
00:17:30,770 --> 00:17:32,870
have accepted ecommerce in a major way,

285
00:17:33,650 --> 00:17:37,590
which we'll get to the.com
companies in a second. Um,

286
00:17:38,530 --> 00:17:39,410
before I get there,

287
00:17:39,411 --> 00:17:44,411
I want to spare a word for Ebay because
Ebay was another company we don't think

288
00:17:44,541 --> 00:17:49,220
of Ebay. Again, God bless him as
like a major player in tech today.

289
00:17:49,890 --> 00:17:54,890
But think of three major things
that Ebay did where I don't,

290
00:17:54,990 --> 00:17:58,470
I can't imagine the world as they hadn't
pioneered these things. Number one,

291
00:17:59,250 --> 00:18:03,360
they taught Americans to trust strangers.
And like I just said,

292
00:18:03,510 --> 00:18:04,470
there were people were like,

293
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:07,190
are we ever going to get convinced
people to put their credit cards online?

294
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:11,810
I would we ever going to convince
them that they can buy and sell from a

295
00:18:11,820 --> 00:18:12,653
company.

296
00:18:12,660 --> 00:18:16,260
Will Ebay convince people you could buy
and sell from somebody in South Dakota

297
00:18:16,261 --> 00:18:18,960
that you would never meet,
never even know their name,

298
00:18:19,470 --> 00:18:23,490
and you could expect a reasonable
chance that you could do a successful

299
00:18:23,491 --> 00:18:28,210
transaction with them. Um, and
because Ebay had that, that, you know,

300
00:18:28,290 --> 00:18:33,060
anybody has a hobby. Everyone
has some sort of hobby that
Ebay could serve. Right?

301
00:18:33,061 --> 00:18:34,050
So Ebay,
again,

302
00:18:34,051 --> 00:18:39,051
like AOL was a lot of normal people's
entree onto not just surfing websites but

303
00:18:39,811 --> 00:18:44,730
being active on the web.
Um, so that's number one.

304
00:18:45,780 --> 00:18:48,480
Number two,
how were they able to do this?

305
00:18:49,380 --> 00:18:51,030
That five star rating system?

306
00:18:52,050 --> 00:18:57,050
Ebay invented the idea of online
reputation systems that things like Uber,

307
00:19:00,150 --> 00:19:01,950
Airbnb, Yelp, all these sorts of things.

308
00:19:01,951 --> 00:19:05,900
We live in the tyranny of the
five star rating now, right? Um,

309
00:19:06,270 --> 00:19:11,100
and there are good and very bad
things about that, but, and it's, it,

310
00:19:11,110 --> 00:19:13,920
it, it was never perfect
even when they created it,

311
00:19:13,921 --> 00:19:18,120
but the fact that they created the
system that allowed people to have a

312
00:19:18,121 --> 00:19:23,121
reasonable level of trust of strangers
that your reputation followed you around.

313
00:19:24,540 --> 00:19:27,720
That was one of the reasons why Ebay
one is because once you invested,

314
00:19:27,721 --> 00:19:29,610
it's the network effect.
Once you invest,

315
00:19:29,790 --> 00:19:34,170
if you're a buyer or a seller and have
a good reputation on Ebay, Amazon,

316
00:19:34,410 --> 00:19:38,370
Yahoo, tons of people came at
them in, in the auction market.

317
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:43,740
But so many people had invested so much
in building this reputation on Ebay that

318
00:19:43,741 --> 00:19:48,720
they weren't going to go
anywhere else. Um, and then
the, the third thing would be,

319
00:19:50,220 --> 00:19:54,450
I'm blanking on it,
right. Um, reputation. Oh,

320
00:19:56,370 --> 00:19:58,830
you know, and this is dead
obvious when I say it, but again,

321
00:19:58,831 --> 00:20:02,250
put yourself back in 1998
they didn't own anything.

322
00:20:03,150 --> 00:20:05,610
They didn't even take
possession of the goods.

323
00:20:06,060 --> 00:20:09,750
So now when we think of
any platform business,

324
00:20:09,810 --> 00:20:14,610
especially social media, all of the
value is in what the users are doing.

325
00:20:15,180 --> 00:20:18,240
There's a story that's in the book that,
um,

326
00:20:18,540 --> 00:20:21,600
newspaper chains came to kick
the tires at Ebay at some point,

327
00:20:22,170 --> 00:20:26,400
which for whatever anyone says,
the newspaper industry was not stupid.

328
00:20:26,850 --> 00:20:31,710
They could see that their cash cow of
classified ads was at risk be of the

329
00:20:31,711 --> 00:20:32,520
Internet.

330
00:20:32,520 --> 00:20:36,840
So all the chains came and wanted to
either partner with Ebay or buy them out.

331
00:20:37,530 --> 00:20:39,940
And one of the,
um,

332
00:20:40,650 --> 00:20:45,650
one of the newspaper executives takes
pure and Jeff Skoll aside and he says,

333
00:20:45,990 --> 00:20:47,920
I,
they really want to do this deal.

334
00:20:47,921 --> 00:20:51,550
But they know that there's no way they
can sell it to the c suite because you

335
00:20:51,551 --> 00:20:54,610
don't have any factories,
you don't have any trucks.

336
00:20:55,240 --> 00:20:57,070
So the CSUITE is going to be like,

337
00:20:57,071 --> 00:21:00,290
what are we buying despite the
fact that we're, you know, our,

338
00:21:00,291 --> 00:21:04,600
our sales are going up 1000% a month
or whatever it was at the time. Um,

339
00:21:04,630 --> 00:21:08,640
so that's the third one.
This idea that, that, uh,

340
00:21:08,800 --> 00:21:13,800
you can build a business that has no
tangible assets other than your users and

341
00:21:14,771 --> 00:21:16,600
whatever activity they
do on your platform.

342
00:21:16,990 --> 00:21:21,790
So ebay deserves more credit for
being a pioneer that's created our,

343
00:21:22,270 --> 00:21:27,100
our modern world. Um, I fought hard to,

344
00:21:27,130 --> 00:21:27,760
uh,

345
00:21:27,760 --> 00:21:32,760
keep a lot of stuff about the.com bubble
in the book because not only is it just

346
00:21:33,340 --> 00:21:37,210
frigging fascinating. Um,
but I think, you know,

347
00:21:37,240 --> 00:21:41,080
coming from the tech industry,
it's sort of like I say in the book,

348
00:21:41,140 --> 00:21:43,270
like my grandparents lived
through the Great Depression.

349
00:21:43,271 --> 00:21:45,520
So any time anything got too good,

350
00:21:45,910 --> 00:21:48,430
they were always convinced that the
depression was around the corner.

351
00:21:48,910 --> 00:21:53,860
And I feel like in tech, anytime, all of
a sudden there's a big IPO or you know,

352
00:21:54,220 --> 00:21:57,100
VC investing goes up by whatever,
whatever, everyone's like,

353
00:21:57,101 --> 00:21:59,110
there's another bubble. There's
another bubble. There's another book.

354
00:22:00,820 --> 00:22:05,820
I did a ton of research and
I hope if you read the book,

355
00:22:06,580 --> 00:22:10,660
the.com bubble for a lot of structural
reasons is something that we're not

356
00:22:10,661 --> 00:22:13,270
likely to ever see again.
Um,

357
00:22:13,420 --> 00:22:16,000
it came at the end of the
longest bull market in history.

358
00:22:16,001 --> 00:22:19,670
The baby boomers were in their
peak, uh, retirement savings years.

359
00:22:19,690 --> 00:22:22,570
There was a ton of money
that had to go somewhere. Um,

360
00:22:22,630 --> 00:22:24,220
the journalist Megan me
heart says in the book,

361
00:22:24,250 --> 00:22:28,300
if the.com companies hadn't come along,

362
00:22:28,301 --> 00:22:31,510
someone would have had to invent them
because Wall Street needed to invest in

363
00:22:31,511 --> 00:22:34,780
something. Um, there will, I mean,

364
00:22:34,810 --> 00:22:39,730
there's always going to be bubbles in
any new industry or new tech and things

365
00:22:39,731 --> 00:22:44,350
like that. Um, but this
idea that, um, you know,

366
00:22:44,351 --> 00:22:45,580
in 98,
99,

367
00:22:46,060 --> 00:22:50,890
all p CNBC was on every TV and
everybody was invested in it. You know,

368
00:22:52,010 --> 00:22:55,300
uh,
among the million fantastic stories,

369
00:22:55,301 --> 00:22:59,980
the idea that Kaytel
who marketed, um, those,

370
00:23:00,340 --> 00:23:05,140
uh, top 40 hits or whenever it
was a music label essentially,

371
00:23:05,800 --> 00:23:08,920
um, in like nine late [inaudible]
98, early [inaudible] 99,

372
00:23:08,921 --> 00:23:11,320
all they did was send out a press
release that said that they were going to

373
00:23:11,321 --> 00:23:12,160
create a website.

374
00:23:12,910 --> 00:23:16,600
And in 24 hours of the stock
went from like $4 to 32.

375
00:23:17,830 --> 00:23:20,770
I, there's a, there's so many
stories like that in this book.

376
00:23:20,771 --> 00:23:24,390
There's a pick salon was a company that,
um,

377
00:23:24,430 --> 00:23:28,360
raise $20 million in VC and blue,

378
00:23:28,600 --> 00:23:32,390
all of it on their launch party in
Las Vegas. They had the who play,

379
00:23:32,391 --> 00:23:33,730
they had the Dixie chicks play.

380
00:23:34,660 --> 00:23:38,830
It turned out that actually the founder
was a legit scammer. The FBI he had,

381
00:23:38,831 --> 00:23:41,950
he was under an alias, the FBI. Eventually
he came and arrested him, blah, blah,

382
00:23:41,951 --> 00:23:46,370
blah. Um, but as I also
point out in the book,

383
00:23:47,780 --> 00:23:52,130
it was this weird time where, uh,
I actually don't have the page,

384
00:23:52,131 --> 00:23:55,190
so I'm going to try to do the
summit from memory. But in

385
00:23:57,410 --> 00:23:58,011
a,

386
00:23:58,011 --> 00:24:03,011
I think it was January of 98 if you had
invested $1,000 an Amazon and $1,000 in

387
00:24:04,581 --> 00:24:07,220
Yahoo by the end of 98,

388
00:24:07,280 --> 00:24:11,420
that $2,000 investment would be
worth something like $78,000.

389
00:24:12,350 --> 00:24:15,110
Now, these are not tiny stocks
that no one had ever heard of.

390
00:24:15,111 --> 00:24:18,470
These are companies that are on the,
on CNBC every day or whatever.

391
00:24:18,980 --> 00:24:23,980
So there's this time period where you
can just pick any company and if you get

392
00:24:24,981 --> 00:24:25,940
in at the right time,

393
00:24:25,970 --> 00:24:30,230
you can 30 x 100 x like some of the best.

394
00:24:30,860 --> 00:24:33,470
The best investment of the time was Ebay.

395
00:24:33,830 --> 00:24:37,880
If you invested in Ebay's Ipo,

396
00:24:37,881 --> 00:24:41,660
I think you did something
like 10000% and by the way,

397
00:24:42,090 --> 00:24:44,270
Eva went down a little bit
after the bubble burst,

398
00:24:44,300 --> 00:24:46,610
but it actually continued
to go up after the bubble.

399
00:24:46,611 --> 00:24:51,320
So if you want to go back in
a time machine and do your
best.com era investment,

400
00:24:51,410 --> 00:24:54,260
it's Ebay again. Um, the,

401
00:24:56,660 --> 00:25:01,660
the DOTCOM bubble is funny in the
sense that it was obviously the,

402
00:25:03,220 --> 00:25:07,880
the greater fools thing. People,
everyone knew it was a bubble.

403
00:25:08,300 --> 00:25:11,300
You're just trying to write it as far
as you can and hopefully get out before

404
00:25:11,510 --> 00:25:15,950
the people behind you get
out. Um, and towards the end,

405
00:25:16,310 --> 00:25:16,751
you know,
you,

406
00:25:16,751 --> 00:25:21,260
you just had to have a pulse at a
business plan written on a Napkin. Again,

407
00:25:21,261 --> 00:25:24,800
there's a story in here about one of
the VC firms where they shared their

408
00:25:24,801 --> 00:25:26,300
numbers and like in 96,

409
00:25:26,810 --> 00:25:31,190
they would get 400 business plans a year.
By 98,

410
00:25:31,191 --> 00:25:33,890
it's 2000 by 2000.

411
00:25:34,130 --> 00:25:36,470
It's something like 15,000 business plans.

412
00:25:36,920 --> 00:25:40,040
And there's a quote in there from one
of the entrepreneurs that says, yeah,

413
00:25:40,070 --> 00:25:43,820
you just showed up and you just said you
were a internet company and they would

414
00:25:43,821 --> 00:25:47,240
just hand you money.
So there was a lot of garbage.

415
00:25:47,540 --> 00:25:51,770
And that's the reason why
the bubble burst. However,

416
00:25:52,430 --> 00:25:54,140
and I'm not the first
person to point this out,

417
00:25:54,470 --> 00:25:59,470
how many of the ideas that were crazy
in the.com bubble have come true today?

418
00:26:00,530 --> 00:26:04,450
One of the most famous ones was Web van,
which is grocery delivery. You know,

419
00:26:04,520 --> 00:26:08,630
go down the list from instacart
to Amazon to whatever. Um,

420
00:26:09,020 --> 00:26:12,200
we all remember pets.com
cause of the sock sock puppet.

421
00:26:13,160 --> 00:26:16,580
But they were also famous for,
you know,

422
00:26:16,670 --> 00:26:20,030
famously dog food is a 40 pound bag.

423
00:26:20,690 --> 00:26:25,490
They were doing free shipping. Um, again,
the statistics are there in the book,

424
00:26:25,491 --> 00:26:29,340
but they were, they were
essentially losing, um,

425
00:26:29,420 --> 00:26:33,870
not only money on every order
they shipped, they were, you know,

426
00:26:33,980 --> 00:26:37,820
losing $2 for every dollar
they brought in. But again,

427
00:26:37,821 --> 00:26:39,140
that's something that has been fixed.

428
00:26:39,141 --> 00:26:43,530
You can go by Amazon or a dog food online
now and people had figured this stuff

429
00:26:43,531 --> 00:26:48,080
out. The logistics have gotten better.
My space.com is a company that IPO mode.

430
00:26:48,390 --> 00:26:48,781
It's not the,

431
00:26:48,781 --> 00:26:52,380
my space you're thinking of it was
literally you would put a widget on your

432
00:26:52,381 --> 00:26:57,270
desktop and you could put files in there.
It was cloud storage. So there were,

433
00:26:58,620 --> 00:27:02,190
there's tons of examples of
this that it was just too soon.

434
00:27:02,670 --> 00:27:06,060
The infrastructure wasn't there,
but there are good ideas.

435
00:27:06,780 --> 00:27:11,370
And so that's one of the reasons why I
think doing a book like this is valuable.

436
00:27:11,371 --> 00:27:14,580
Like everybody in tech. Once you know
someone to come up and tell them what,

437
00:27:14,581 --> 00:27:16,050
where are we going next,
what's next or what,

438
00:27:16,980 --> 00:27:21,980
how much can you learn by looking back
at the things that were either dumb ideas

439
00:27:22,800 --> 00:27:26,310
and are always going to be dumb ideas
and learned that lesson or that were a

440
00:27:26,311 --> 00:27:30,090
dumb idea in a different time but didn't
work for reasons that now woodwork.

441
00:27:31,050 --> 00:27:35,730
And one of the things about the.com bubble
that we'll talk about Google here in

442
00:27:35,731 --> 00:27:36,520
a second,

443
00:27:36,520 --> 00:27:41,520
but that the people that came after the
bubble took advantage of was they laid

444
00:27:42,391 --> 00:27:46,610
this entire infrastructure of fiber.
There was a,

445
00:27:46,660 --> 00:27:49,740
a bubble that no one remembers
concurrent with the.com bubble.

446
00:27:50,130 --> 00:27:52,470
Things like global crossing
and Enron and all this stuff.

447
00:27:52,680 --> 00:27:57,390
They laid all of this fiber all around
the world so that when Google comes along

448
00:27:57,870 --> 00:28:02,490
and there's like 90% unused
fiber around the world,

449
00:28:02,850 --> 00:28:05,720
Google is able to pick it up on the cheap.
Um,

450
00:28:06,090 --> 00:28:09,750
so the DOTCOM bubble has
to be remembered as a,

451
00:28:10,170 --> 00:28:13,890
the lessons of the, the ideas that
were too soon but maybe can work later.

452
00:28:14,250 --> 00:28:19,250
But then also the infrastructure that
created the circumstances that allowed the

453
00:28:19,921 --> 00:28:24,750
resurrection and Web 2.0 at that
Google was very much a part of,

454
00:28:25,650 --> 00:28:30,120
uh, we debated how much I
should talk about Google at
Google because I don't know

455
00:28:30,121 --> 00:28:33,950
how much you guys like know about Google.
Um,

456
00:28:35,060 --> 00:28:39,390
I, there's actually the better part of
two chapters about the Google story.

457
00:28:39,870 --> 00:28:42,810
You know, cute stuff about Larry and
Sergei meeting each other in college,

458
00:28:42,811 --> 00:28:45,480
which you probably have heard these
stories and they didn't like each other at

459
00:28:45,481 --> 00:28:47,550
first because they're both
the smartest guys in the room.

460
00:28:48,060 --> 00:28:51,720
And so there was a little bit of friction
but like the free song of like, well,

461
00:28:51,810 --> 00:28:55,170
I'm going to open up this guy. He,
I want to one up when I went. Um,

462
00:28:55,530 --> 00:28:56,940
you probably know some of that stuff.

463
00:28:57,660 --> 00:29:02,660
The thing that I liked to
focus on was obviously,

464
00:29:03,740 --> 00:29:05,190
um,
fixing search.

465
00:29:05,220 --> 00:29:09,480
How would the web and the Internet
function had they not done that?

466
00:29:09,870 --> 00:29:12,180
That's Google's miracle.
Number one,

467
00:29:12,930 --> 00:29:17,040
Google's business miracle number
two is obviously ad words, ad sense,

468
00:29:17,041 --> 00:29:19,740
creating the greatest advertising
engine devised by man.

469
00:29:21,090 --> 00:29:23,730
But y'all didn't invent that.

470
00:29:24,780 --> 00:29:29,780
A company called goto.com did and go to a,

471
00:29:30,151 --> 00:29:32,790
was a a bubble. You're a company, um,

472
00:29:33,390 --> 00:29:38,390
came out of an incubator and it was a
straight pay for position search engine.

473
00:29:39,510 --> 00:29:43,510
Um, actually got a lot of um, success.

474
00:29:43,900 --> 00:29:48,900
It went on to power the paid search for
Yahoo and AOL and others as overture.

475
00:29:50,170 --> 00:29:53,980
They changed the name of overture. And
again, I actually used go to at the time,

476
00:29:53,981 --> 00:29:56,440
but for Edwards came along.
But why did I switch to ad words?

477
00:29:56,441 --> 00:29:58,630
Because like Google tends to do,

478
00:29:59,020 --> 00:30:02,660
even if they don't think
of the idea first, uh,

479
00:30:03,430 --> 00:30:05,650
Googlers tend to think they
can always do it better.

480
00:30:06,190 --> 00:30:11,170
And they did because instead of
a straight pay for position, um,

481
00:30:11,320 --> 00:30:14,440
when ad-words launches, it is, uh,

482
00:30:14,470 --> 00:30:19,180
has the quality scores and things like
that. So as I point out in the book, it's,

483
00:30:19,720 --> 00:30:24,400
there's almost no example of this
that I can think of an even any other

484
00:30:24,401 --> 00:30:26,380
industry. It was a win, win,

485
00:30:26,381 --> 00:30:31,381
win for everybody because they did the
testing and the users actually preferred

486
00:30:33,160 --> 00:30:37,090
the ads because, because of the quality
score, they were useful. You know,

487
00:30:37,091 --> 00:30:40,690
you do the Ab testing and you put the
ads there and there's actually people are

488
00:30:40,691 --> 00:30:42,890
happier and do more clicking.
Um,

489
00:30:42,940 --> 00:30:47,940
advertisers like me at the time are
paying less because if my ad is more

490
00:30:48,221 --> 00:30:51,130
relevant, it goes to the top, but
I'm still paying what I'm bidding.

491
00:30:51,970 --> 00:30:54,910
And Google's happier because again,

492
00:30:55,450 --> 00:31:00,250
even if someone's willing to pay a dollar
a click and I'm only willing to pay a

493
00:31:00,251 --> 00:31:04,120
nickel a click,
but I over a hundred searches,

494
00:31:04,300 --> 00:31:08,740
I get clicked on 21 times and that
dollar bid only gets clicked on once.

495
00:31:09,460 --> 00:31:12,880
Google makes more money,
when, when, when I like,

496
00:31:12,910 --> 00:31:16,430
it's a miraculous market that,
um,

497
00:31:16,780 --> 00:31:19,630
that's the second miracle
that I give Google credit for

498
00:31:21,700 --> 00:31:22,870
the,
um,

499
00:31:23,620 --> 00:31:28,620
another company or story that I thought
I knew that then actually doing it.

500
00:31:29,591 --> 00:31:34,270
I realized what the real story was was
Napster. So if you remember Napster,

501
00:31:35,140 --> 00:31:40,060
you think music piracy, a bunch of
college kids that just, you know,

502
00:31:40,300 --> 00:31:42,340
broadband is becoming ubiquitous.

503
00:31:42,670 --> 00:31:47,670
And so this is the first time that media
has to deal with piracy in a major way.

504
00:31:49,060 --> 00:31:49,870
Um,

505
00:31:49,870 --> 00:31:54,870
I talked to a bunch of the Napster guys
and it's so funny that most of them to

506
00:31:56,081 --> 00:32:00,820
this day still cling to this. And if
you read their quotes, they were right.

507
00:32:01,900 --> 00:32:03,940
They set at the time,
they say, to this day,

508
00:32:04,330 --> 00:32:08,680
we knew this was the better
distribution method that again,

509
00:32:08,681 --> 00:32:11,650
why do you put something in a box,
shrink wrap it and put it on a shelf.

510
00:32:13,180 --> 00:32:16,540
And they were talking
about things like Spotify,

511
00:32:17,020 --> 00:32:21,870
like Netflix for a slightly different
model. You know, at the inn in 1999,

512
00:32:21,871 --> 00:32:25,870
Sean Parker is on MTV talking about
what we think it will be a subscription.

513
00:32:25,871 --> 00:32:28,680
You're going to be able to get it
on your phone or your computer,

514
00:32:28,690 --> 00:32:31,720
whatever the device of the
future is. He has a quote. Um,

515
00:32:32,560 --> 00:32:33,371
they were right about that.

516
00:32:33,371 --> 00:32:37,720
But what I realize that the
true story of Napster was,

517
00:32:38,350 --> 00:32:43,350
is we live now in a world of unlimited
selection and instant gratification.

518
00:32:44,570 --> 00:32:49,460
If I tell you about a song, a movie,
a book, a TV show, hey, this is cool.

519
00:32:49,461 --> 00:32:53,240
You should check it out.
You expect that in 10 seconds,

520
00:32:53,960 --> 00:32:57,980
you can try it out. Unlimited
selection, instant gratification.

521
00:32:58,010 --> 00:33:01,670
They were screaming this in 1999,
2000,

522
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:06,200
this is what the consumer wants.
And actually if you give it to them,

523
00:33:06,620 --> 00:33:10,130
they'll pay for it.
And it's true.

524
00:33:10,310 --> 00:33:12,050
What does Spotify have?

525
00:33:12,051 --> 00:33:16,910
I think it's approaching 90 million
paying subscribers now. Netflix is,

526
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:21,410
you know, approaching 200 or 250
million paying subscribers worldwide.

527
00:33:22,010 --> 00:33:22,843
It's

528
00:33:24,170 --> 00:33:27,470
the unlimited selection
part of that equation.

529
00:33:27,800 --> 00:33:30,320
Instant gratification is
probably what makes people pay.

530
00:33:31,010 --> 00:33:36,010
But I don't think that we appreciate
the unlimited selection part of that.

531
00:33:37,150 --> 00:33:40,070
Um, I remember the first time
I came to New York in 1998,

532
00:33:40,071 --> 00:33:43,070
the thing that I wanted to do more than
anything was to go to tower records

533
00:33:43,071 --> 00:33:46,400
because I knew that they would have cds
that I couldn't get back in Florida.

534
00:33:46,430 --> 00:33:49,100
Right. Um, and you know,

535
00:33:49,101 --> 00:33:52,710
you can talk about the good and
the bad of that of, you know,

536
00:33:52,760 --> 00:33:57,760
the idea of discovery and serendipity
has maybe lost when you can get anything

537
00:33:58,161 --> 00:34:00,670
you want as soon as you want it. But, um,

538
00:34:01,100 --> 00:34:06,100
I think that Napster deserves to be
thought of not just as a story of piracy,

539
00:34:07,431 --> 00:34:11,950
but as esentially laying the template for,
um,

540
00:34:12,050 --> 00:34:13,490
media and the digital age,

541
00:34:13,940 --> 00:34:18,410
even though they didn't get there because
of Sean Parker's unfortunate emails

542
00:34:18,411 --> 00:34:22,820
that got brought up in
discovery in the trial. Um,

543
00:34:25,160 --> 00:34:29,090
let's see, for the purposes of time,
what else do I want to talk about? The,

544
00:34:29,570 --> 00:34:33,410
the web 2.0 era to bring Google
back into this because again,

545
00:34:33,411 --> 00:34:35,960
I was there and I was doing
companies at the time.

546
00:34:36,770 --> 00:34:37,603
MMM.

547
00:34:39,980 --> 00:34:40,813
You,

548
00:34:42,140 --> 00:34:47,000
it's sort of like you have
to be in a zeitgeists to
just like know, like in 2005,

549
00:34:47,030 --> 00:34:51,380
2004, 2005 like you could feel that
there was stuff happening again.

550
00:34:51,740 --> 00:34:54,560
Google's IPO was a big part of that.
Like,

551
00:34:55,130 --> 00:34:57,470
I'll never forget people just being like,

552
00:34:57,530 --> 00:35:00,410
when we all found out that Google was
making the amount of money it was making,

553
00:35:00,411 --> 00:35:02,120
it was like holy s like,

554
00:35:02,570 --> 00:35:07,570
because y'all really did make the
internet make money at scale for the first

555
00:35:09,171 --> 00:35:10,220
time.
No one had,

556
00:35:10,370 --> 00:35:14,120
this is at a time in like 2003 when
Amazon is like a $5 stock and people are

557
00:35:14,121 --> 00:35:17,100
thinking they might go under,
um,

558
00:35:17,270 --> 00:35:21,560
basically no one in the web 2.0 era
had proven that they could make money.

559
00:35:22,110 --> 00:35:24,020
Um, Yahoo, AOL,

560
00:35:24,021 --> 00:35:28,580
they all kind of rode the bubble but
they weren't sustainable businesses. Um,

561
00:35:28,820 --> 00:35:32,090
so your guys's IPO in 2004
is a big part of that.

562
00:35:32,090 --> 00:35:36,590
But then I remember flicker
for the first time delicious.

563
00:35:36,591 --> 00:35:37,740
And you know,

564
00:35:38,670 --> 00:35:43,050
reading tech crunch and you would
win when tech crunch first came out,

565
00:35:43,080 --> 00:35:44,220
you would read it every day,

566
00:35:44,221 --> 00:35:49,221
not because they were doing
these journalistic stories
about the tech industry,

567
00:35:49,860 --> 00:35:54,120
but because Mike was just posting
new startups every single day.

568
00:35:54,630 --> 00:35:57,420
And like he would literally email Mike
and be like, Hey Mike, I'm doing this.

569
00:35:57,421 --> 00:36:01,500
And he would write a post about it and
it was just this weirdly magical time

570
00:36:01,920 --> 00:36:06,780
when you would read a blog post and find
out about something like flicker and

571
00:36:06,781 --> 00:36:10,560
then dig a little deeper and find out
about things like taxonomy and tagging.

572
00:36:11,790 --> 00:36:16,650
And it was this thousand flowers
blooming sort of period where,

573
00:36:16,950 --> 00:36:21,720
which I want to point out. And I said
this last week on a, on a radio thing, um,

574
00:36:22,530 --> 00:36:23,730
why did that happen?

575
00:36:23,820 --> 00:36:28,750
We kind of have to credit the
Microsoft antitrust trial. Um,

576
00:36:28,890 --> 00:36:33,720
why was Google able to flourish?
Why did Amazon not swoop in and buy?

577
00:36:33,750 --> 00:36:37,110
Or why did Microsoft not swoop in
and buy Amazon in 1998 or whatever?

578
00:36:37,440 --> 00:36:42,420
Why were all these companies like
Google, like Facebook, like, you know,

579
00:36:42,421 --> 00:36:47,421
name any because there was
not this rapacious 800 pound
gorilla that is willing

580
00:36:48,991 --> 00:36:53,910
to come in and Cherry pick all of
the most promising crop of startups.

581
00:36:54,980 --> 00:36:57,480
Uh, not here to talk about
things like, you know,

582
00:36:57,481 --> 00:36:59,460
regulating tech in antitrust
and things like that.

583
00:36:59,461 --> 00:37:04,461
But the arts are an entire decade where
companies can come up and there's not

584
00:37:06,450 --> 00:37:07,500
this,
you know,

585
00:37:07,560 --> 00:37:11,220
oligopoly at the top that's going
to sharecrop everybody off and Borg,

586
00:37:11,221 --> 00:37:13,290
like absorb them.
Um,

587
00:37:13,440 --> 00:37:17,100
and there was this whole flowering of
all of the companies that we're now very

588
00:37:17,101 --> 00:37:21,600
familiar with today. Um, so something
to think about that if you're,

589
00:37:21,720 --> 00:37:26,720
if you have a period of time where you're
allowing companies to innovate and to

590
00:37:27,031 --> 00:37:32,031
find their product market fit without
being absorbed by the board right away,

591
00:37:33,180 --> 00:37:35,470
a lot of good things can happen.
Um,

592
00:37:36,540 --> 00:37:38,970
the Facebook chapter,

593
00:37:39,420 --> 00:37:44,130
I essentially wanted to sort
of write the anti movie,

594
00:37:44,700 --> 00:37:45,240
um,

595
00:37:45,240 --> 00:37:50,240
because everybody knows the movie and
while the movie was not a inaccurate,

596
00:37:50,490 --> 00:37:55,410
there's obviously some circuiting
going on there. Um, and, and, uh,

597
00:37:55,650 --> 00:37:58,560
changes made for, uh, entertainment value.

598
00:37:59,250 --> 00:38:04,250
I kind of focused more on this
idea of this modern startup,

599
00:38:04,650 --> 00:38:08,950
a startup like we think of it today. A
kid in a dorm room has a great idea. Um,

600
00:38:09,250 --> 00:38:11,880
again,
in the wake of the bubble bursting,

601
00:38:13,110 --> 00:38:15,480
I think it was the dig guys or something.

602
00:38:15,510 --> 00:38:19,230
There's a quote in there about how like,
I think digg.com,

603
00:38:19,231 --> 00:38:20,280
if you remember that they,

604
00:38:20,550 --> 00:38:25,550
they launched for $10,000 and within
six months they're getting more traffic

605
00:38:25,561 --> 00:38:30,510
than the New York Times. It's because
again, the infrastructure had been laid.

606
00:38:30,511 --> 00:38:33,650
We now have things, you know,
if you start a startup now you,

607
00:38:33,780 --> 00:38:36,850
there's all these open source tools,
you just pull off the shelf. Uh,

608
00:38:36,880 --> 00:38:40,390
Google had the advantage of after the
bubble burst, everybody's out of work.

609
00:38:40,540 --> 00:38:45,130
So Google is the only game in town
for picking off the best talent. Um,

610
00:38:46,060 --> 00:38:50,780
but in the Facebook story,
I more wanted to tell, um,

611
00:38:51,490 --> 00:38:56,490
because it's fascinating and there's a
lot of Sean Parker quotes that illustrate

612
00:38:56,801 --> 00:38:57,634
this,

613
00:38:57,670 --> 00:39:01,930
how much it was a lark and
for how long it was a Lark,

614
00:39:02,350 --> 00:39:04,540
even after they go out to California,

615
00:39:04,780 --> 00:39:08,730
even after they don't go back to Harvard.
Um,

616
00:39:08,920 --> 00:39:11,980
Zuckerberg wanted to do
a thing called wire hog,

617
00:39:12,310 --> 00:39:15,970
which was like a Napster 2.0
sort of thing. And again,

618
00:39:15,971 --> 00:39:19,000
this is from Sean Parker speaking.
So take this with a grain of salt,

619
00:39:19,001 --> 00:39:23,020
but he essentially has to take
Zuckerberg aside and say, forget Napster.

620
00:39:23,021 --> 00:39:25,600
I know that that was the coolest thing
that ever happened when you were in 19,

621
00:39:25,601 --> 00:39:28,960
but you've got something here. This
is the thing. Facebook is the thing.

622
00:39:29,650 --> 00:39:32,140
So I was fascinated by how much,

623
00:39:33,250 --> 00:39:35,200
and there's the famous stories about,
you know,

624
00:39:35,201 --> 00:39:38,710
showing up to VC meetings in
pajamas and I'm the CEO Bitch,

625
00:39:38,920 --> 00:39:43,720
how much it was kids playing
adult for how long it was, um,

626
00:39:44,410 --> 00:39:47,950
insert your thoughts about what that
did to the culture of the company here.

627
00:39:48,490 --> 00:39:52,210
But I'm also fascinated by,
you know,

628
00:39:52,240 --> 00:39:53,590
famously another,

629
00:39:54,490 --> 00:39:59,490
another Harvard dropout was Bill Gates
and bill gates is a genius and a lot of

630
00:40:00,581 --> 00:40:00,971
ways,

631
00:40:00,971 --> 00:40:04,690
but the argument that I make in the book
is the interesting entrepreneurs are

632
00:40:04,691 --> 00:40:08,020
the entrepreneurs that were
not born to be entrepreneurs,

633
00:40:08,920 --> 00:40:13,840
but they stumble on an idea that's genius
and then they make themselves into the

634
00:40:13,841 --> 00:40:18,370
person that can bring that idea to life.

635
00:40:19,180 --> 00:40:23,920
I think that Bill Gates was a person like
that. If you read biographies of Gates,

636
00:40:24,190 --> 00:40:27,700
he was an enfant terrible
of the tech industry,

637
00:40:28,630 --> 00:40:31,960
stories of strippers and things like
that back in the early eighties,

638
00:40:31,961 --> 00:40:35,520
and things like that.
He evolved into, uh, uh,

639
00:40:35,680 --> 00:40:39,590
a person that could create the most
valuable company in the world. Um,

640
00:40:40,230 --> 00:40:40,950
the,

641
00:40:40,950 --> 00:40:45,950
the Facebook story is a lot
about Zuckerberg turning
down $1 billion from Yahoo.

642
00:40:47,360 --> 00:40:52,300
Um, Viacom wants to come in, they
want to turn it into MTV. When,

643
00:40:52,301 --> 00:40:56,170
when my space gets bought for $700
million, everyone's like, wow, you know,

644
00:40:56,171 --> 00:40:57,400
maybe that's the price we should.

645
00:40:57,850 --> 00:41:02,590
So what I was interested in in the
Facebook story was that evolution of

646
00:41:02,591 --> 00:41:07,591
Zuckerberg and the evolution of the idea
into believing that this is a product.

647
00:41:08,291 --> 00:41:12,430
What other product is before
Facebook was your pretend,

648
00:41:12,580 --> 00:41:16,090
your potential addressable market,
every human being on the planet,

649
00:41:17,050 --> 00:41:20,230
maybe cocacola you know,
um,

650
00:41:20,710 --> 00:41:25,710
I think that realizing that and then
being able to execute on that is the thing

651
00:41:26,111 --> 00:41:30,200
that fascinates me about the
Facebook and Zuckerberg story. Uh,

652
00:41:30,220 --> 00:41:34,400
to wind up here. I, uh, and
again, to come back to the,

653
00:41:35,060 --> 00:41:36,440
the notion of too soon,

654
00:41:36,710 --> 00:41:40,490
I do tell the story of
the pro social companies.

655
00:41:40,820 --> 00:41:45,440
Six degrees was founded in 1997 and it's
essentially a social network as we know

656
00:41:45,441 --> 00:41:48,110
it today. One, I know one of
the reasons why it didn't work,

657
00:41:49,280 --> 00:41:50,540
there weren't digital cameras.

658
00:41:51,770 --> 00:41:54,980
There's a quote in here about how they're
having board meetings at how can we

659
00:41:54,981 --> 00:41:59,660
convince people to get photos and print
them out and then fax them to us so that

660
00:41:59,661 --> 00:42:03,620
we can have profile pictures.
When you think of a, an idea,

661
00:42:03,710 --> 00:42:05,900
why does an idea network,
why is it too soon?

662
00:42:05,901 --> 00:42:10,070
Because the technology wasn't
ubiquitous to have profile pictures.

663
00:42:10,670 --> 00:42:12,190
Um,
uh,

664
00:42:12,470 --> 00:42:16,880
Friendster didn't work because famously
they didn't engineer it well enough.

665
00:42:17,480 --> 00:42:22,240
Um, I had him on the podcast and he'll
straight up admit that that yeah, we,

666
00:42:22,280 --> 00:42:26,700
the ability to engineer
something at that scale. Um,

667
00:42:26,820 --> 00:42:31,490
again, people like Google and
Facebook deserve credit for putting,

668
00:42:31,600 --> 00:42:35,940
uh, that sort of stuff together. Um,
and then why did Facebook beat myspace?

669
00:42:36,290 --> 00:42:38,420
I go into that as well.
Um,

670
00:42:39,140 --> 00:42:42,140
I go into for forever,

671
00:42:42,170 --> 00:42:44,930
I can remember hearing that mobile
is going to be the next big thing.

672
00:42:44,931 --> 00:42:48,500
You're going to get the internet
on your phone. And I, and I,

673
00:42:48,501 --> 00:42:51,110
like everyone else was like, well,
why, if I want to get on the Internet,

674
00:42:51,111 --> 00:42:53,680
I'll sit down and do
it, you know, like, um,

675
00:42:53,720 --> 00:42:57,320
so palm and the Newton and blackberry.

676
00:42:57,800 --> 00:43:01,760
I tell those stories and I'm going to
end with this. Like I end with the book.

677
00:43:02,300 --> 00:43:07,300
What I realized in writing
the conclusion of the book,

678
00:43:07,551 --> 00:43:11,030
because I knew I wanted to
end with the iPhone and with,

679
00:43:11,110 --> 00:43:15,920
with Steve Making that demo on stage and
it's three things. Are you getting it?

680
00:43:15,921 --> 00:43:19,220
It's not this, this,
this, it's one device. Um,

681
00:43:19,970 --> 00:43:24,970
I think that the reason that mobile
didn't take off for so many years when you

682
00:43:28,611 --> 00:43:31,330
could have had a phone that
would get you the Internet in,

683
00:43:31,331 --> 00:43:36,331
in 2000 and 2002 for all
the various reasons why fi,

684
00:43:36,430 --> 00:43:39,950
you know, four g broadband was a
built out all these different reasons.

685
00:43:40,010 --> 00:43:44,180
The real reason is because there wasn't
anything for normal people to do with it.

686
00:43:45,230 --> 00:43:49,520
The iPhone comes out in 2007,
six months later,

687
00:43:50,060 --> 00:43:52,730
Facebook opens registration to everybody.

688
00:43:53,510 --> 00:43:56,810
When the APP store is launched in 2008,

689
00:43:57,260 --> 00:43:59,930
one of the first 20
partner Apps is Facebook.

690
00:44:00,860 --> 00:44:05,860
So mobile didn't take off because there
wasn't anything for normal people to do

691
00:44:07,611 --> 00:44:07,881
with it.

692
00:44:07,881 --> 00:44:11,270
And then all of a sudden there's this
one device that is not only the perfect

693
00:44:11,271 --> 00:44:16,190
device for consumption of a social stuff,

694
00:44:16,550 --> 00:44:19,400
it's the perfect tool for
creating social content.

695
00:44:20,210 --> 00:44:25,210
So maybe you had to have Facebook go
mainstream for the iPhone and smartphones

696
00:44:28,281 --> 00:44:33,281
to go mainstream and vice versa because
wood with my mom care about Facebook.

697
00:44:35,460 --> 00:44:40,460
If she couldn't pick up her phone and
check it 30 times a day and she couldn't

698
00:44:40,530 --> 00:44:42,600
take pictures and share stuff herself.

699
00:44:43,110 --> 00:44:48,110
So I think it getting to this theme of
too soon or having the perfect timing,

700
00:44:50,670 --> 00:44:55,670
I think that the reason that the modern
world is mobile and social today is

701
00:44:56,011 --> 00:45:00,450
because the iPhone and Facebook,
uh,

702
00:45:00,451 --> 00:45:04,590
opening registration happened with an
18 months of each other and the two

703
00:45:04,591 --> 00:45:08,220
complemented each other perfectly.
And that's the modern world.

704
00:45:08,221 --> 00:45:12,300
We now live it and I
think I'm right on time.

705
00:45:12,301 --> 00:45:16,440
So if anybody has questions, I'd be happy
to take questions for a few minutes.

706
00:45:23,020 --> 00:45:23,853
Thank you guys.

707
00:45:27,730 --> 00:45:28,563
Don't be shy.

708
00:45:31,950 --> 00:45:33,650
Hi, thanks for coming. Um,

709
00:45:33,720 --> 00:45:37,680
do you have any examples of things you
discovered researching that the world

710
00:45:37,681 --> 00:45:40,580
wasn't ready for yet, but that you think
the world now he's ready for it? That,

711
00:45:40,640 --> 00:45:41,490
that we don't have yet.

712
00:45:43,880 --> 00:45:47,480
Isn't it funny, uh, Vr and Ar,

713
00:45:48,500 --> 00:45:50,180
this is not really going
to answer your question,

714
00:45:50,540 --> 00:45:55,190
but I remember in the 90s that Vr
was the next big thing and you know,

715
00:45:55,191 --> 00:45:58,440
Jaron and everybody, the, some of the
same people were telling you that,

716
00:45:58,460 --> 00:46:00,540
that are telling you that today.
Um,

717
00:46:01,590 --> 00:46:01,920
yeah.

718
00:46:01,920 --> 00:46:05,320
Aye. Aye. Aye. It's, maybe
I'm thinking of this as it,

719
00:46:05,321 --> 00:46:08,480
my answer because I was just talking
about the mobile stuff is like,

720
00:46:09,200 --> 00:46:12,890
when are we going to get,
what I just said is, you know,

721
00:46:12,891 --> 00:46:17,390
people sometimes call it a killer app,
but for things like VR and Ar,

722
00:46:17,840 --> 00:46:21,500
we're not just,
it's the visicalc for pcs or whatever.

723
00:46:22,130 --> 00:46:26,270
But it's the thing that it's like, oh
yeah, that's why I would buy this device.

724
00:46:26,870 --> 00:46:30,680
Um, so in a way I'm answering
your question by saying,

725
00:46:30,800 --> 00:46:33,800
isn't that where we are now for Vr and ar?

726
00:46:34,280 --> 00:46:38,270
Except it's just not happening and I'm,
and I'm not,

727
00:46:38,300 --> 00:46:40,190
I'm not a skeptic or a pessimist on this.

728
00:46:40,191 --> 00:46:44,380
I'm actually genuinely at
this point confused. Um,

729
00:46:44,840 --> 00:46:46,100
but,
uh,

730
00:46:47,390 --> 00:46:50,180
something that is the right time for now.

731
00:46:52,260 --> 00:46:53,093
Hmm.

732
00:46:54,520 --> 00:46:57,040
All of the.com companies,
like I said,

733
00:46:57,041 --> 00:47:00,850
have basically borne fruit in 2.0 um,

734
00:47:02,170 --> 00:47:04,120
you know what,
I don't have a good answer for that one.

735
00:47:04,800 --> 00:47:04,960
Well,

736
00:47:04,960 --> 00:47:07,030
it's okay if those are great mc or someone
would probably have done it already.

737
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:12,680
No, no, no. That's not how that
works. No. And, and when you think,

738
00:47:13,210 --> 00:47:15,620
uh, the famous story about
Google is, is, you know,

739
00:47:15,621 --> 00:47:18,770
who needed another search engine.
There was Alta Vista, there was Yahoo,

740
00:47:18,771 --> 00:47:20,900
there was excited or whatever there was,

741
00:47:21,860 --> 00:47:23,810
that was the dumbest
startup idea in the world,

742
00:47:23,840 --> 00:47:28,310
except for one level thing
is that it worked. So even
if the market is saturated,

743
00:47:28,311 --> 00:47:29,530
even if everyone's like,

744
00:47:29,531 --> 00:47:33,640
well we've tried that a thousand times
and it doesn't work, but if yours does,

745
00:47:34,210 --> 00:47:37,540
then it doesn't matter.
Yeah, yeah. Thanks. Yup.

746
00:47:45,120 --> 00:47:46,370
You can line up too if you want.

747
00:47:48,750 --> 00:47:53,750
So one thing about the internet
was that until fairly recently,

748
00:47:54,970 --> 00:47:57,360
the majority of the world,
we're still not using it.

749
00:47:57,630 --> 00:48:02,630
And so you could come up with this crazy
new idea and there was all this room

750
00:48:02,851 --> 00:48:03,684
for growth,

751
00:48:04,400 --> 00:48:08,490
but very slowly getting to the point
where we're like hitting that saturation,

752
00:48:08,790 --> 00:48:09,910
right?
Uh,

753
00:48:09,930 --> 00:48:13,650
the growth of the Internet is starting
to slow down in terms of penetration

754
00:48:13,651 --> 00:48:14,484
worldwide.

755
00:48:15,110 --> 00:48:20,110
Do you think that once we get to
the point where most people who

756
00:48:22,320 --> 00:48:25,050
can afford to have any kind
of connection have one,

757
00:48:25,350 --> 00:48:30,090
that there's still going to be
room to have these crazy new ideas?

758
00:48:30,210 --> 00:48:35,070
Oh, will we end up in the surf mature
Internet market where it's like everything

759
00:48:35,071 --> 00:48:35,780
else?
Again,

760
00:48:35,780 --> 00:48:39,740
I would argue you're going to get
better companies because what you're

761
00:48:39,741 --> 00:48:43,070
describing is the low hanging
fruit has already been eaten.

762
00:48:43,970 --> 00:48:48,470
So all you had to do, even five or
eight years ago was just come up with a,

763
00:48:48,560 --> 00:48:53,000
a chat app that did something slightly
differently and then in 18 months you

764
00:48:53,001 --> 00:48:57,620
have a billion users. Right? Okay,
maybe that market's saturated now.

765
00:48:57,621 --> 00:49:02,360
So how are you going to build the next
great chat platform, communications,

766
00:49:02,380 --> 00:49:05,960
whatever you've got to do it better as
opposed to just you're the first one and

767
00:49:05,961 --> 00:49:10,961
this virgin market and just because you
planted your flag first you get to reap

768
00:49:11,121 --> 00:49:15,440
all the rewards. So right.
That is over perhaps. I mean,

769
00:49:15,441 --> 00:49:18,270
I would argue that around
the edges because you know,

770
00:49:18,320 --> 00:49:20,700
we're still a far away from um,

771
00:49:20,860 --> 00:49:25,670
a hundred percent penetration on a lot
of key details. But even if we are,

772
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:27,120
then all that means is,

773
00:49:27,121 --> 00:49:30,170
is you're going to have to differentiate
by doing something truly different as

774
00:49:30,171 --> 00:49:31,880
opposed to just being
the first one to show up.

775
00:49:32,780 --> 00:49:37,310
So I would argue that from
a consumer side of it,

776
00:49:37,640 --> 00:49:40,220
it's going to be better because you're
going to get more interesting ideas that

777
00:49:40,221 --> 00:49:44,540
more interesting companies.
Is it going to be harder from a founder?

778
00:49:45,100 --> 00:49:48,410
Is it going to be a harder slog? Isn't
gonna be harder to differentiate? Yeah,

779
00:49:48,830 --> 00:49:53,510
but guess what, then do the work
and you'll reap the rewards. So,

780
00:49:57,680 --> 00:49:57,820
hey,

781
00:49:57,820 --> 00:50:02,730
so I'm curious if in your research you
found anything about how a changing

782
00:50:02,731 --> 00:50:05,820
notions of privacy to the affected
the course of the Internet,

783
00:50:05,821 --> 00:50:09,090
because I was thinking
about how you mentioned I'm
getting over this hurdle of I

784
00:50:09,091 --> 00:50:11,700
shouldn't put my credit card information
on the Internet and I certainly

785
00:50:11,701 --> 00:50:13,770
remember,
don't put your real name on the Internet.

786
00:50:13,771 --> 00:50:16,530
Don't meet people who you haven't
met in real life on the Internet,

787
00:50:16,800 --> 00:50:18,120
which you've kind of all or,

788
00:50:18,690 --> 00:50:22,860
or even as late as 2006 or whatever
articles of like, um, don't,

789
00:50:23,100 --> 00:50:25,400
don't make your Facebook private.
Don't put anything up. No,

790
00:50:25,401 --> 00:50:27,770
no one will hire you versus now today,

791
00:50:27,771 --> 00:50:30,770
would you hire anyone that didn't
have a social media presence? They,

792
00:50:30,771 --> 00:50:33,030
you'd be like, well that's a little weird.
The go on. Sorry. Yeah, let's do it.

793
00:50:33,170 --> 00:50:34,070
That's the other thing.
Now,

794
00:50:34,071 --> 00:50:37,740
it's almost like there's a reversal
of that trend where debatable too,

795
00:50:37,760 --> 00:50:38,451
to what point,

796
00:50:38,451 --> 00:50:42,920
but kind of the general internet users
becoming more conscious of privacy. Again,

797
00:50:43,760 --> 00:50:46,730
it's almost like we're through the
looking glass, right? Um, again,

798
00:50:46,731 --> 00:50:49,700
when I'm in the library looking
at articles from 99 and 2000,

799
00:50:49,701 --> 00:50:54,680
like DoubleClick would do things that
would make the front page of the New York

800
00:50:54,681 --> 00:50:57,110
Times that if I,
I can't remember the details right now,

801
00:50:57,111 --> 00:50:58,640
but if I described it to you,
you'd be like,

802
00:51:00,020 --> 00:51:02,630
they did that and it caused
a privacy upper or whatever.

803
00:51:03,050 --> 00:51:05,270
I'm actually formulating
a theory about this,

804
00:51:05,271 --> 00:51:09,950
which is that because the bubble happened
and people thought that the Internet

805
00:51:09,951 --> 00:51:13,220
was a fad that was over,
people stopped paying attention.

806
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:16,130
And so when these other,

807
00:51:16,160 --> 00:51:20,210
when these companies started to make money
again and they were doing things that

808
00:51:20,211 --> 00:51:25,211
were data sucking and
things that annoy us now,

809
00:51:25,431 --> 00:51:27,170
today it's just no one
was paying attention.

810
00:51:27,171 --> 00:51:29,900
And then when people start
to use their products,

811
00:51:31,320 --> 00:51:34,940
especially the social products,
it just seemed fun and good and whatever.

812
00:51:34,941 --> 00:51:38,930
And so it was just this period of
about a decade where no one was paying

813
00:51:38,931 --> 00:51:43,931
attention and all the products on first
glance just seemed to be net good.

814
00:51:44,710 --> 00:51:49,670
Um, so it's sort of like the Fox got away
with rating the Hen House for awhile.

815
00:51:50,060 --> 00:51:54,410
Yes. People are coming around to
paying attention to this stuff again.

816
00:51:54,950 --> 00:51:58,250
And so from people being super,
super,

817
00:51:58,251 --> 00:52:02,180
almost too excessively
worried about privacy,

818
00:52:02,420 --> 00:52:06,590
10 not paying attention at all to
now waking up to this, you know,

819
00:52:06,860 --> 00:52:11,030
there's nothing you can hide and I
have no control over any of my data.

820
00:52:11,540 --> 00:52:16,540
I think we're through the looking glass
on that and to your previous questions,

821
00:52:17,000 --> 00:52:19,340
like I think that the
way to differentiate,

822
00:52:19,400 --> 00:52:22,310
especially if we're entering an era
where there's going to be greater

823
00:52:22,670 --> 00:52:24,200
regulations and things like that,

824
00:52:24,470 --> 00:52:29,030
one way to differentiate is really
going to be like, you can trust us.

825
00:52:29,510 --> 00:52:30,830
You know,
uh,

826
00:52:31,100 --> 00:52:36,100
the famous don't be evil motto
was primarily aimed at Microsoft.

827
00:52:36,200 --> 00:52:40,040
Hey, don't go work for Microsoft work
for us. We're not like those idiots.

828
00:52:40,910 --> 00:52:45,360
But it was also, you know,
people generally, uh,

829
00:52:46,310 --> 00:52:50,180
believed in Google as a force for
good and like organizing the world's

830
00:52:50,181 --> 00:52:53,480
information and things like that.
So I think that, you know, uh,

831
00:52:53,500 --> 00:52:56,180
a startup that could brand itself,

832
00:52:56,181 --> 00:52:59,810
not just for branding purposes
but like as an a legitimate,

833
00:52:59,840 --> 00:53:04,840
like we care about you first and our
products separate second and making money

834
00:53:07,431 --> 00:53:12,431
third that I think that you could stand
out in the current environment and as,

835
00:53:13,480 --> 00:53:16,340
cause I don't see the backlash
ebbing away anytime soon.

836
00:53:16,820 --> 00:53:20,000
Like I think that leaning in that
direction is that something that could be

837
00:53:20,001 --> 00:53:22,370
pretty powerful right
now. Interesting. Thanks.

838
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:31,520
Hey, I'm curious if you have any thoughts
on this assistant thing where you think

839
00:53:31,521 --> 00:53:33,500
it's going to go? So I going to
change the way we use the internet.

840
00:53:34,510 --> 00:53:36,030
Yeah, that's interesting. Um,

841
00:53:37,980 --> 00:53:42,700
I mentioned earlier I do the daily
tech main podcast also and uh,

842
00:53:43,070 --> 00:53:46,300
I almost did a segment last week about,
someone wrote a piece about

843
00:53:48,460 --> 00:53:53,460
what are the assistants doing right
now that are functionally better than

844
00:53:54,431 --> 00:53:58,750
another input mechanism
aside from, hey, Google,

845
00:53:58,751 --> 00:54:03,640
play this song. Now I know the
argument can be made, well, hey Google,

846
00:54:03,641 --> 00:54:04,810
buy this for me or hey,

847
00:54:05,380 --> 00:54:09,760
but we're still at this point where
functionally for a lot of things,

848
00:54:10,090 --> 00:54:14,230
even if you get the,
the latency and things like that and the,

849
00:54:14,650 --> 00:54:17,670
the ability to recognize a normal
speech and things like that,

850
00:54:17,710 --> 00:54:21,560
even if you guys fixed all that,
which you're working on, I,

851
00:54:21,730 --> 00:54:23,350
there's still not anything yet.
Again,

852
00:54:23,351 --> 00:54:26,650
it's the whole idea of a killer
app where it's like, well, I would,

853
00:54:27,760 --> 00:54:32,290
I will speak this to an assistant because
it's functionally better than sitting

854
00:54:32,291 --> 00:54:36,050
down at a keyboard or using
a mouse or tapping. Um,

855
00:54:36,200 --> 00:54:41,200
I haven't seen that yet and I have yet
to be convinced that there's an entire

856
00:54:41,261 --> 00:54:43,510
class of computing that in the longterm,

857
00:54:43,540 --> 00:54:47,080
because we've been able
to dictate speech to text,

858
00:54:47,170 --> 00:54:50,590
to our computers from how many of
you actually, when you write emails,

859
00:54:50,591 --> 00:54:54,520
do whatever dictation you could. You've
been able to do that for a decade now,

860
00:54:55,000 --> 00:54:59,230
but you don't. So, um, I don't actually
remember what your question was,

861
00:54:59,740 --> 00:55:04,420
but I'm, I'm still skeptical
about convinced me that, that,

862
00:55:04,480 --> 00:55:09,310
that there is a class of computing
that that's actually the better input

863
00:55:09,311 --> 00:55:12,090
paradigm before I'm willing
to be convinced. Yeah.

864
00:55:18,890 --> 00:55:23,390
Uh, it's touches a little
bit on that question about
Internet saturation, but, um,

865
00:55:24,260 --> 00:55:28,440
and just the fact that there's a lot
of big companies now that you know, uh,

866
00:55:28,590 --> 00:55:32,020
compared to 10 years ago, uh, it,

867
00:55:32,120 --> 00:55:35,060
a lot of those markets seem like they
have really strong network effects.

868
00:55:35,580 --> 00:55:38,510
So what do you, how do you see
things potentially playing out there?

869
00:55:42,530 --> 00:55:46,960
You know, that even five
years ago, I think right now,

870
00:55:46,961 --> 00:55:49,810
today,
even after the recent stock market stuff,

871
00:55:50,350 --> 00:55:53,920
eight of the top 10 companies in the
world by market cap are tech companies.

872
00:55:54,640 --> 00:55:59,410
And each and every one of them you can
point to certain network effects in them.

873
00:56:00,160 --> 00:56:04,690
Um, five years ago, even if there
was only one, it was either,

874
00:56:04,691 --> 00:56:08,170
you guys are Microsoft, I can't
remember in the top 10. Um,

875
00:56:09,850 --> 00:56:13,030
one of the things that concerns me
is that it is an oligopoly and a

876
00:56:13,031 --> 00:56:14,060
consolidation at the top.

877
00:56:14,070 --> 00:56:17,440
It gets back to that Microsoft thing about
there was a decade where there was no

878
00:56:17,441 --> 00:56:21,280
one to come in and scoop
up the innovators. Um,

879
00:56:21,700 --> 00:56:26,700
but I also wonder about that in the
sense that because there are so many,

880
00:56:29,380 --> 00:56:33,790
there's not a network effect
for everything. And there
are certain companies,

881
00:56:34,180 --> 00:56:39,180
the fangs among them that
have these network effects
in certain markets that are

882
00:56:41,320 --> 00:56:44,080
functionally Buffet's moats.

883
00:56:44,980 --> 00:56:48,100
And so this is not really
answering your question again,

884
00:56:48,101 --> 00:56:53,101
but is it going to be chipping away
at those moats because we know that an

885
00:56:54,311 --> 00:56:57,590
innovator can come around and eat
someone's lunch from below at any time,

886
00:56:57,910 --> 00:57:02,910
but if you have these five
or six overlapping strong
network effect markets that

887
00:57:04,661 --> 00:57:05,830
are essentially killed,

888
00:57:06,580 --> 00:57:10,600
then is innovation going to have to
go around that and to other markets.

889
00:57:10,840 --> 00:57:15,840
But then is the only playbook that we
know how to do is to work with network

890
00:57:16,031 --> 00:57:19,950
effects and build platforms and
choke off everybody else. Um,

891
00:57:20,620 --> 00:57:22,810
I actually,
here I've got an answer for you.

892
00:57:23,290 --> 00:57:26,290
I don't think that this current
state of affairs can last very long.

893
00:57:26,650 --> 00:57:31,000
Not only because inevitably there will
be innovators coming up from below,

894
00:57:31,330 --> 00:57:33,370
but I think you guys,

895
00:57:33,430 --> 00:57:37,930
the big guys are going to start chipping
away at each other in various ways that

896
00:57:37,931 --> 00:57:40,300
are going to weaken some
players and whatever.

897
00:57:40,720 --> 00:57:43,240
And if you do get some sort of like a,

898
00:57:43,540 --> 00:57:47,860
a period of five to 10 years of like
heavy battle on things like assistance in

899
00:57:47,861 --> 00:57:50,290
smart speakers, which everybody
seems to want to play in that field,

900
00:57:50,710 --> 00:57:54,910
then just if everybody's shooting
guns at each other, you know,

901
00:57:55,300 --> 00:57:56,530
reservoir dogs style,

902
00:57:56,740 --> 00:58:00,560
no one notices the guy that's coming
in the room on the other side.

903
00:58:00,580 --> 00:58:02,200
So it's hearsay

904
00:58:02,290 --> 00:58:03,600
related following question.

905
00:58:03,630 --> 00:58:06,990
It seems like we've gone from a
world where things were for a while,

906
00:58:06,991 --> 00:58:10,080
very federated, like he knows very
federative program or protocol.

907
00:58:10,081 --> 00:58:12,710
Anybody can do that to
a whole lot of silos.

908
00:58:13,000 --> 00:58:15,470
You have more inboxes
now than they used to.

909
00:58:15,900 --> 00:58:18,540
Do you see that sort of thing reversing?

910
00:58:18,541 --> 00:58:23,541
Like if not just like someone comes in
and takes over one of these things and

911
00:58:24,121 --> 00:58:27,790
becomes, takes over. Let's
talk network effect here.

912
00:58:28,260 --> 00:58:33,050
Facebook, you could
already for 25 years, uh,

913
00:58:33,380 --> 00:58:38,330
dial up your own webpage,
you could share your photos,

914
00:58:38,360 --> 00:58:41,180
you could do daily updates and
things like that. All that any,

915
00:58:41,181 --> 00:58:44,750
any of these guys have done have just
made it easier to make a webpage.

916
00:58:44,780 --> 00:58:47,220
My mom didn't have to know how to code,
you know,

917
00:58:47,360 --> 00:58:50,480
and I'm talking beyond
things like, you know, um,

918
00:58:51,290 --> 00:58:54,830
Weebly and things like that I'm talking
about like literally all they did is

919
00:58:54,831 --> 00:58:59,540
make it simpler to communicate
digitally, online. Um,

920
00:58:59,570 --> 00:59:03,980
there's still, so just go simpler
beyond that. And beyond that,

921
00:59:04,340 --> 00:59:05,870
I think that if you,

922
00:59:06,200 --> 00:59:11,200
if you extrapolate beyond like
you can go beyond the silos.

923
00:59:12,620 --> 00:59:17,620
Like I can see a world like Twitter
should be thought of as a web utility,

924
00:59:19,220 --> 00:59:22,940
not as a company. Right. And that's people
that lost in Twitter. Exactly. Yeah.

925
00:59:23,210 --> 00:59:26,540
So I can see that one way,

926
00:59:26,570 --> 00:59:30,560
one route of innovation is to just
continue to simplify and you can simplify

927
00:59:30,561 --> 00:59:33,800
your way out of the silos into
what it would functionally be.

928
00:59:34,100 --> 00:59:38,930
Sort of an open source sort of
environment where messages can't be owned.

929
00:59:39,440 --> 00:59:40,191
Like it is kind of,

930
00:59:40,191 --> 00:59:43,790
think of it from that sort of weird
look at it from another angle.

931
00:59:44,150 --> 00:59:48,650
Why our messages in silos. There's
no functional reason. It's text.

932
00:59:48,860 --> 00:59:51,110
It's just text because all your
friends are on this network.

933
00:59:51,111 --> 00:59:55,890
So you're on that network or whatever. Um,
you know, there, there used to be in a,

934
00:59:55,910 --> 00:59:57,410
you couldn't,
if you were on aim,

935
00:59:57,411 --> 01:00:01,940
you couldn't talk to someone on MSN chat
and things like that. Um, I think that,

936
01:00:02,330 --> 01:00:06,680
and I hope this is true, I think that
the web tends to bend towards open.

937
01:00:07,450 --> 01:00:09,490
Um,
and we might 10 years from now,

938
01:00:09,500 --> 01:00:13,880
look back at this period as an aberration
simply because information does want

939
01:00:13,881 --> 01:00:14,714
to be free.

940
01:00:14,870 --> 01:00:19,870
And there's not really any reason why
things like texts or pictures have to be

941
01:00:20,361 --> 01:00:23,340
siloed other than those network effects.
Thanks.

942
01:00:26,690 --> 01:00:30,380
I think we should wrap up. All
right. Thanks everybody for coming.

943
01:00:30,670 --> 01:00:35,160
[inaudible].
