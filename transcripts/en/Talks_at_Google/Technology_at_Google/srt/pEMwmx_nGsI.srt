There you go.

11
00:00:45,450 --> 00:00:48,880
Hey guys, my name is John. You shy. I'm
going to be your moderator this evening.

12
00:00:48,910 --> 00:00:53,140
Can you guys hear me in the
back? All right. Yeah. All
right, so I work at Youtube.

13
00:00:53,170 --> 00:00:55,420
I work on our influencer
in creator marketing,

14
00:00:55,540 --> 00:00:59,050
which basically means I have to watch a
ton of videos every day and get to know

15
00:00:59,051 --> 00:01:00,100
what's going viral,

16
00:01:00,130 --> 00:01:04,210
who our biggest stars from 1 million to
10 million subscribers and just have a

17
00:01:04,211 --> 00:01:04,961
lot of fun with it.

18
00:01:04,961 --> 00:01:08,710
I call it more of an obsession then a
profession and it's something that I never

19
00:01:08,711 --> 00:01:12,820
imagined at your age that I'd be doing
and I just thought I'd start off before

20
00:01:12,821 --> 00:01:14,800
we get to this amazing
panel that we have here.

21
00:01:14,860 --> 00:01:17,920
Just to give a little bit more context
because I think tonight is all about

22
00:01:17,921 --> 00:01:20,350
dress code.
It's all about fashion and tech,

23
00:01:20,530 --> 00:01:23,440
but it's also all about paying it forward,
right?

24
00:01:23,590 --> 00:01:26,560
And I think if you ask anybody on
this panel were, we'll get into it.

25
00:01:26,561 --> 00:01:29,110
If you ask myself,
if you ask anybody behind you,

26
00:01:29,320 --> 00:01:34,150
tonight's all about giving what we got
when we were in your shoes and nobody got

27
00:01:34,151 --> 00:01:37,330
to this place alone.
And I want to ask you guys in high school,

28
00:01:37,870 --> 00:01:42,130
how many of you guys know what you
want to be when you grow up? Really?

29
00:01:42,370 --> 00:01:44,980
Okay. Awesome. So I want
to tell you two things.

30
00:01:45,100 --> 00:01:49,450
There's no such thing as growing up.
No such thing.

31
00:01:49,860 --> 00:01:50,291
In fact,

32
00:01:50,291 --> 00:01:54,240
one of my favorite quotes is that growing
up is the moment you realize there's

33
00:01:54,250 --> 00:01:58,750
no such thing. Tweet it, tweet it.

34
00:01:59,140 --> 00:02:01,580
Sweet. It's good. Um,

35
00:02:02,890 --> 00:02:05,830
and there's no such thing as
being one thing when you grow up

36
00:02:07,950 --> 00:02:08,783
charge.

37
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:16,320
And lastly, the things that the people
that raised their hand, I applaud you.

38
00:02:16,321 --> 00:02:18,690
You guys know more than
I ever did in your shoes,

39
00:02:18,810 --> 00:02:21,660
but I guarantee you what you
want to be today will change.

40
00:02:21,780 --> 00:02:26,310
And all I have to say is embrace it.
Your career will change a ton.

41
00:02:26,490 --> 00:02:30,000
You will change a ton,
you'll get a lot of advice from mentors,

42
00:02:30,060 --> 00:02:31,530
some of which you'll meet today,

43
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:34,860
others of which you'll meet in the most
unexpected ways on this journey we call

44
00:02:34,861 --> 00:02:37,080
life.
And I just encourage you to go with it.

45
00:02:37,170 --> 00:02:40,470
There's no wrong answers and there's a
place for everyone in this world and when

46
00:02:40,471 --> 00:02:42,000
it comes to finding what's right for you.

47
00:02:44,060 --> 00:02:44,893
Cool.

48
00:02:48,660 --> 00:02:49,980
Awesome.
So let's get into our panel.

49
00:02:49,981 --> 00:02:51,930
Let's give it up one more
time for them for coming out.

50
00:02:55,060 --> 00:02:58,000
We got, we got two mikes. We got
to, all right. There you go. Cool.

51
00:02:58,030 --> 00:03:00,460
So I thought I'd things off.
I'm always,

52
00:03:00,461 --> 00:03:04,930
one of the questions I love asking
people is what are you most proud of in,

53
00:03:05,010 --> 00:03:07,930
in your past? And what are you most
excited about in your presence?

54
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:09,640
So if you want to talk a
little bit about yourself,

55
00:03:09,641 --> 00:03:12,760
but just mention of all the amazing
things you guys have done on this panel,

56
00:03:12,910 --> 00:03:15,850
what's something you're most proud of
in your past and what's something that

57
00:03:15,851 --> 00:03:18,670
you're excited about moving
forward in the future? Uh,

58
00:03:18,700 --> 00:03:21,470
we'll start with you if you want to take
it or if you want to work on and we can

59
00:03:21,471 --> 00:03:24,460
start over there. Start
all right. Right here.

60
00:03:26,350 --> 00:03:29,530
Okay. So for me, I'm just going
to move on to bring the mic up.

61
00:03:29,531 --> 00:03:34,480
So a little back story on me.
So I went to school for six years.

62
00:03:34,481 --> 00:03:39,350
I did six years of college and graduated
with a doctorate of pharmacy degree. Um,

63
00:03:39,370 --> 00:03:44,370
I graduated and I realized
that I hated it and you know,

64
00:03:45,130 --> 00:03:49,740
and I also, um, you know, wanted
to tap into my creative side, um,

65
00:03:50,020 --> 00:03:52,270
and kind of do what I
was passionate about.

66
00:03:52,870 --> 00:03:57,430
And so we're going back to this question.
I'm proud of the fact that, um, you know,

67
00:03:57,431 --> 00:03:59,290
I'm a pharmacist,
but I'm also proud of the head,

68
00:03:59,291 --> 00:04:03,730
the courage enough to go after
what it is that I love to do. Um,

69
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:07,960
because like he said, you never grew
up. And so as 17 when you're told, okay,

70
00:04:07,961 --> 00:04:09,430
it's time for you to pick a major in,

71
00:04:09,431 --> 00:04:11,830
figure out what it is that you want
to do for the rest of your life,

72
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:17,160
you don't always know and you go into
something and you complete it and then

73
00:04:18,071 --> 00:04:20,350
it's like, okay, I'm stuck.
But you're never stuck.

74
00:04:20,740 --> 00:04:23,690
So you always have to know that
you have the power to, you know,

75
00:04:23,740 --> 00:04:27,440
do whatever it is that you
put your mind to. So yes.

76
00:04:31,590 --> 00:04:32,423
Okay.

77
00:04:32,580 --> 00:04:34,070
I'm Chloe.
Um,

78
00:04:34,200 --> 00:04:38,820
I think something I'm proud of myself
in my past is that I always have really

79
00:04:39,300 --> 00:04:43,320
considered education a huge part
of what I do, even though I'm now,

80
00:04:43,321 --> 00:04:45,810
I'm doing youtube full time
all throughout high school.

81
00:04:45,811 --> 00:04:48,120
I've been doing youtube for seven years,
so all throughout high school,

82
00:04:48,121 --> 00:04:51,390
like I really focused on learning,
talked about it in my videos,

83
00:04:51,391 --> 00:04:53,880
talked about studying for the
act and applying to colleges.

84
00:04:53,881 --> 00:04:57,090
And it's always been something I've
really pushed. So I think, you know,

85
00:04:57,120 --> 00:05:01,980
no matter what you do, bringing education
into it is very important. And then, um,

86
00:05:02,010 --> 00:05:06,180
just something I'm focusing on right
now is building a team and learning more

87
00:05:06,181 --> 00:05:07,080
about the industry,

88
00:05:07,081 --> 00:05:11,100
learning more about what message
I want to spread to everyone. So

89
00:05:11,670 --> 00:05:12,503
beautiful.
Yeah.

90
00:05:14,010 --> 00:05:14,843
Yup.
Give it up.

91
00:05:17,210 --> 00:05:20,480
Hi, I'm ally. Um, I do youtube as well.

92
00:05:20,810 --> 00:05:25,400
I think one of the things that I'm
most proud of is that I never gave up.

93
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:29,550
Uh, the journey getting to where
I'm at today was not easy. Uh,

94
00:05:29,570 --> 00:05:33,860
but I love that it wasn't easy because
it made me who I am. Um, and yeah,

95
00:05:33,861 --> 00:05:37,910
I mean it took me about four years,
uh,

96
00:05:37,911 --> 00:05:40,280
and it was actually longer than that,

97
00:05:40,281 --> 00:05:44,390
but once I started the committed
myself a team of about four years, um,

98
00:05:44,420 --> 00:05:47,750
but it was an easy and a lot of the
things that you guys are going to be

99
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:49,220
passionate about it that you guys love,

100
00:05:49,221 --> 00:05:53,810
you guys will find out that it's not easy.
So never ever give up on your dreams.

101
00:05:54,170 --> 00:05:56,000
Always work hard,
believe in yourself.

102
00:05:56,001 --> 00:05:58,940
And I always say that if
you put the time and effort,

103
00:05:58,941 --> 00:06:03,110
you guys can make anything
happen. Um, and now I've, um,

104
00:06:03,380 --> 00:06:05,750
now I have youtube,
I have three channels.

105
00:06:06,140 --> 00:06:10,870
I also have a couple of businesses that
I've started with my husband and, um,

106
00:06:11,300 --> 00:06:14,020
that's my future now, so
awesome. That's amazing. Yeah.

107
00:06:14,750 --> 00:06:15,583
Okay.

108
00:06:16,090 --> 00:06:20,150
What about you John? Yup.
She gets here. Me. Um, yeah,

109
00:06:21,010 --> 00:06:22,750
so he's one of says
here's what I want to say.

110
00:06:22,840 --> 00:06:26,800
This is actually pretty big for me. This
is, this is probably a big moment for me.

111
00:06:26,801 --> 00:06:31,740
It's a milestone for me.
Um, I have a crazy story in,

112
00:06:31,741 --> 00:06:36,640
in fashion. Um, I've been professionally
in fashion for the last 18 years. I just,

113
00:06:36,641 --> 00:06:38,410
I just had my birthday,
so a,

114
00:06:38,420 --> 00:06:42,370
believe it or not and me and my twin
brother just turned 40. Uh, wow. Yeah.

115
00:06:45,530 --> 00:06:50,310
What Cameras Alex? We still
a good bro. Um, so, uh,

116
00:06:50,350 --> 00:06:54,670
real quick, what I want to say is,
uh, I'm Filipino. Um, and uh, not,

117
00:06:54,700 --> 00:06:59,140
not Hispanic, but in, in, in New York and
Florida, apparently I'm Puerto Rican, so,

118
00:06:59,950 --> 00:07:03,250
but what I want to say is I'm Filipino
and your parents want you to be an

119
00:07:03,251 --> 00:07:04,870
engineer or a nurse.

120
00:07:05,230 --> 00:07:08,910
And so I met someone who worked for
Russell Simmons when I was 18 and he,

121
00:07:08,911 --> 00:07:12,160
he designed clothing and never
knew that that could be a job,

122
00:07:12,161 --> 00:07:16,490
that I can design streetwear.
And so I was like, that's crazy.

123
00:07:16,520 --> 00:07:20,980
Now it's, this event is big for me
because I also teach in a high school.

124
00:07:21,220 --> 00:07:25,000
Um, so shout to frontier and
[inaudible] hi everybody in Whittier.

125
00:07:25,200 --> 00:07:28,840
Shout out to everybody there. But I
was telling my students, um, you know,

126
00:07:28,841 --> 00:07:31,030
I always tell my students is like,

127
00:07:31,060 --> 00:07:33,610
at the point when I started
to search my career,

128
00:07:33,611 --> 00:07:35,440
I went backwards and I
said what I want to do.

129
00:07:35,740 --> 00:07:38,290
So of course everyone wants
to be a baller, right?

130
00:07:38,291 --> 00:07:41,770
So I want to make money and I wanted to
travel and I wanted something different.

131
00:07:41,771 --> 00:07:46,330
So when I met a designer, I was like,
that's what I want to do. I took my folks,

132
00:07:46,570 --> 00:07:51,340
I sat him down, I was 18 years old
and I was like, okay, don't freak out.

133
00:07:51,370 --> 00:07:54,640
I'm going to drop out of
college and I don't worry,

134
00:07:54,850 --> 00:07:57,760
I'm going to be coming apparel designer.
And they thought I was crazy.

135
00:07:57,940 --> 00:08:01,390
My twin brother told me late here later
that they were like convinced John to go

136
00:08:01,391 --> 00:08:04,540
back to school. So I did go to school.
I learned, I learned the classes,

137
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:08,020
all my graphic design programs
and everything. And uh, and it,

138
00:08:08,060 --> 00:08:09,400
there's a reason on the panel today.

139
00:08:09,401 --> 00:08:11,830
I was a director of the last
three companies I've been with.

140
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:16,990
I've managed a multiple multimillion
dollar clothing lines and uh, yeah,

141
00:08:16,991 --> 00:08:18,280
so it's been a great story for your man.

142
00:08:18,281 --> 00:08:21,650
Youtube channel helps people learn
how to lunch clothing lines. So, uh,

143
00:08:21,710 --> 00:08:23,320
that's what I'm proud of.
Amazing.

144
00:08:27,960 --> 00:08:28,710
Oh,
okay.

145
00:08:28,710 --> 00:08:32,580
Yeah. Waiting for me. Oh my God.
I can leave on Wednesdays, right.

146
00:08:33,060 --> 00:08:37,800
How are we getting panic attacks,
heart attacks? I'm here. Okay.

147
00:08:37,801 --> 00:08:41,310
So my name is Brittany. I'm,
my channel is fashion related.

148
00:08:41,311 --> 00:08:42,990
I teach people how to
make their own garments.

149
00:08:42,991 --> 00:08:46,080
The outfit that I'm wearing right now,
I have a tutorial for,

150
00:08:46,410 --> 00:08:49,740
so it's a skirt in a rap top. And, um,

151
00:08:49,741 --> 00:08:53,820
I'm just really proud of how far
my youtube channel has grown,

152
00:08:53,821 --> 00:08:55,140
especially being as sewing.

153
00:08:56,100 --> 00:09:00,030
Um, that's like one of the
least search thing on youtube.

154
00:09:01,080 --> 00:09:04,710
But, um, what I did to really
stand out on Youtube, um,

155
00:09:04,770 --> 00:09:09,770
I used to intern for Michael Costello
and so I really started doing light

156
00:09:09,841 --> 00:09:14,070
trending fashion. So, um, what
I realized is that was people,

157
00:09:14,071 --> 00:09:17,280
was it putting out like gown tutorials.

158
00:09:17,281 --> 00:09:22,170
So I will show people how to make your
own gown or how to make a wedding dress.

159
00:09:22,171 --> 00:09:26,690
So the stuff that people would send me
from like all over the world with like

160
00:09:26,700 --> 00:09:27,533
amazing.

161
00:09:27,780 --> 00:09:32,280
So I do have a clothing line now and
I'm just really excited to see where it

162
00:09:32,281 --> 00:09:34,170
takes off from now.
I love it.

163
00:09:40,120 --> 00:09:42,640
So there's a few things in there
that I want to dive deep on.

164
00:09:42,641 --> 00:09:46,000
First I want to say how awesome it is
that they really owned that question.

165
00:09:46,001 --> 00:09:48,100
When somebody asks you like what
you're proud of and all of that,

166
00:09:48,101 --> 00:09:48,970
you shouldn't shy away.

167
00:09:48,971 --> 00:09:51,830
I love how you guys really talk about
all the hard work you've put in and,

168
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,850
and all the great things that
have come about that. John,

169
00:09:54,851 --> 00:09:56,950
you mentioned something really
interesting. Then I think,

170
00:09:57,070 --> 00:09:59,680
you know when you're in high school your
parents obviously have a huge influence

171
00:09:59,681 --> 00:10:02,800
on you as they do throughout the rest of
your life and they always want the best

172
00:10:02,801 --> 00:10:03,011
for you.

173
00:10:03,011 --> 00:10:06,430
But I think it's so interesting growing
up in today's world where many of the

174
00:10:06,431 --> 00:10:09,760
professions that will take aren't
even in existence right yet.

175
00:10:09,970 --> 00:10:12,040
And I want to talk about each
of you to each of you guys.

176
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:15,750
How did you have that initial conversation
with your parents that you were going

177
00:10:15,751 --> 00:10:19,600
to do what your heart desired and what
you're doing now and do you have any

178
00:10:19,601 --> 00:10:22,180
advice for people in the audience
who may be thinking the same thing?

179
00:10:22,181 --> 00:10:24,460
Like maybe your maybe your parents.
It doesn't have to be, Hey,

180
00:10:24,461 --> 00:10:26,500
I'm dropping out of school.
It has to be more like, Hey,

181
00:10:26,501 --> 00:10:29,530
I don't want to be a doctor or a lawyer.
I want to do something else.

182
00:10:29,531 --> 00:10:32,710
Like do you have advice for people in
the audience that may be wanting to

183
00:10:32,711 --> 00:10:33,430
produce a more,

184
00:10:33,430 --> 00:10:37,060
more untraditional path as untraditional
becomes more of the norm in today's

185
00:10:37,061 --> 00:10:41,480
world? Open? Anyone jump in, jump in.

186
00:10:41,650 --> 00:10:44,230
I feel like obviously our parents love us.

187
00:10:44,500 --> 00:10:48,310
So if they see that you're
truly passionate about
something and maybe in the

188
00:10:48,311 --> 00:10:50,520
beginning they'll be very
shocked and they'll want,

189
00:10:50,590 --> 00:10:55,300
maybe try to talk you out of it.
But when they see passion and dedication,

190
00:10:55,420 --> 00:10:57,370
I mean I'm sure they're
going to support you,

191
00:10:57,371 --> 00:11:00,240
but always start everything
with honesty and if it's,

192
00:11:00,241 --> 00:11:04,090
if what they want is not what you want,
speak up.

193
00:11:04,120 --> 00:11:06,460
Obviously it's your,
it's going to be your life.

194
00:11:06,461 --> 00:11:08,920
It's going to be your time and you have
to make sure that whatever it is that

195
00:11:08,921 --> 00:11:09,161
you do,

196
00:11:09,161 --> 00:11:11,710
you're truly passionate about because
it's something that you're going to have

197
00:11:11,711 --> 00:11:15,610
to dedicate a lot of time into it.
So,

198
00:11:16,140 --> 00:11:16,420
okay.

199
00:11:16,420 --> 00:11:19,030
Yeah. Beautifully said. Anybody
else? Any other thoughts?

200
00:11:19,450 --> 00:11:22,870
Well, for me, luckily my
parents are really supportive.

201
00:11:22,900 --> 00:11:26,320
I just remember I barely learned how
to sell like three or four years ago.

202
00:11:26,960 --> 00:11:30,280
But I remember when I was three
years old, I made my mom, um,

203
00:11:30,460 --> 00:11:35,160
a pair of shoes out of newspaper and
she wore those around the house. Ah,

204
00:11:35,380 --> 00:11:39,190
yes. But she didn't realize,
she knew I love fashion,

205
00:11:39,191 --> 00:11:40,690
but she didn't realize how,

206
00:11:41,110 --> 00:11:45,400
how big it would be for me now
because I'm designing for, you know,

207
00:11:45,401 --> 00:11:49,360
celebrities and I've been
working for Miko Costello.

208
00:11:49,361 --> 00:11:53,230
I had to say that again.
I was going to say he did design dresses,

209
00:11:53,470 --> 00:11:56,920
Beyonce, Lady Gaga. I could keep going.

210
00:11:57,590 --> 00:12:00,640
But when you're really
passionate about something, um,

211
00:12:00,750 --> 00:12:03,340
I just feel like you'll succeed in it.

212
00:12:03,341 --> 00:12:05,650
And that's how I felt
like with my fashion.

213
00:12:05,950 --> 00:12:08,440
That's beautiful.
And I think it also goes to say there's,

214
00:12:08,470 --> 00:12:11,500
there's 7 billion people in the world.
Like small is big.

215
00:12:11,590 --> 00:12:13,990
Like there's people who share
the same interest as you.

216
00:12:13,991 --> 00:12:15,580
So if you're passionate about something,

217
00:12:15,730 --> 00:12:17,800
then there's generally a
lot of people out there.

218
00:12:17,801 --> 00:12:21,160
And one of the reasons I'm so proud to
work at youtube is that youtube gives

219
00:12:21,161 --> 00:12:24,280
that access. So if you have an
idea, you can just upload, connect,

220
00:12:24,281 --> 00:12:26,920
and who knows where that
will take you later. Um,

221
00:12:27,010 --> 00:12:31,510
any other thoughts about the parent
conversation or advice? Uh, a couple

222
00:12:31,530 --> 00:12:35,120
quick points. I should say
this, I did drop out of college,

223
00:12:35,121 --> 00:12:38,090
but I went back later while
I was working full time.

224
00:12:38,300 --> 00:12:41,090
I went back to school online so that
I could teach at a high school. Okay.

225
00:12:41,180 --> 00:12:43,210
I'm not just, I'm so, I'm a huge fan.

226
00:12:43,280 --> 00:12:46,840
My twin brother is actually an assistant
principal. Wow. Yeah. So it's all ma.

227
00:12:46,970 --> 00:12:49,390
I'm a huge fan of education.
Um,

228
00:12:49,490 --> 00:12:53,300
but what I want to say for what
I will say to my students, um,

229
00:12:53,301 --> 00:12:55,940
so this is like a big glass
room for me is, you know,

230
00:12:55,941 --> 00:12:58,370
the studies are showing that you're
going to work in a couple of different

231
00:12:58,371 --> 00:13:01,610
industries by the time you guys
go to get your careers. Okay.

232
00:13:01,611 --> 00:13:03,380
So that tells me a lot of things.
Um,

233
00:13:03,381 --> 00:13:08,381
your degree is going to be about the
ability to go through tough finals and to

234
00:13:09,171 --> 00:13:12,340
weather through it, but you also need
to have flexibility in terms of a,

235
00:13:12,341 --> 00:13:17,180
having a skillset that you can then
put to something else. Right. And, and,

236
00:13:17,210 --> 00:13:21,800
um, real quick, I just want
to save on that note of
attacking what you want to do.

237
00:13:21,980 --> 00:13:23,900
Um, you brought up a good
point. You're going to do it,

238
00:13:23,930 --> 00:13:26,630
you're going to be in the workplace
more than you're going to be with your

239
00:13:26,631 --> 00:13:29,360
family, your wife, your
husband, your kids later.

240
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:32,930
So it got to be something
you're passionate about. And
in terms of attacking it,

241
00:13:33,290 --> 00:13:37,190
like what I don't see is
like sometimes the hunger.

242
00:13:37,460 --> 00:13:40,070
So you gotta be relentless about it.
Uh,

243
00:13:40,100 --> 00:13:42,650
like quit story when I lived in San Diego,

244
00:13:42,890 --> 00:13:45,620
I've found that 10 brands
that I wanted to work for,

245
00:13:45,950 --> 00:13:48,470
and this was before Internet.
Okay. There was, there was,

246
00:13:48,500 --> 00:13:52,670
there's the portion about coding
and everything. So when I speak,

247
00:13:52,671 --> 00:13:56,720
I'll say we use the term computer nerd
when I was in high school and then it

248
00:13:56,721 --> 00:14:00,770
gets, it gets just like this, it gets
nothing. Right? But before it was, we can,

249
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:02,990
I can afford a computer.
I mean, it was expensive.

250
00:14:02,991 --> 00:14:06,560
Now everybody got it on their phone.
But you gotta be relentless about,

251
00:14:06,590 --> 00:14:10,310
about really attacking it.
So I found 10 brands I researched,

252
00:14:10,311 --> 00:14:13,130
I went to them and I said, hey,
I'm going to be a designer.

253
00:14:13,131 --> 00:14:17,130
I'm not one right now and I will drive
from San Diego to get you a coffee.

254
00:14:17,930 --> 00:14:21,140
And then when they said no,
I would come back and I have 10 questions.

255
00:14:21,380 --> 00:14:24,140
How did you get this job?
What's the best thing about your job?

256
00:14:24,141 --> 00:14:27,020
What sucks about it? What's a
tough month? What's a good one?

257
00:14:27,100 --> 00:14:31,250
What's a high and low? Those
sort of things. So a couple
pieces of advice there,

258
00:14:31,251 --> 00:14:34,460
but that's the kind of mind state
that I have when I attack it.

259
00:14:34,461 --> 00:14:36,980
And so for this 18 year career,

260
00:14:36,981 --> 00:14:41,750
I've done a little bit of styling on music
videos. I was doing, uh, you know, uh,

261
00:14:41,900 --> 00:14:45,560
I was a fashion editor for a little bit,
but it's all been around brands,

262
00:14:45,561 --> 00:14:48,800
but I use the same skillset on
to the next kind of venture.

263
00:14:48,801 --> 00:14:52,040
And you guys should kind of have
that too when attacking your career.

264
00:14:52,640 --> 00:14:53,660
That's amazing.
Wow.

265
00:14:56,630 --> 00:14:57,463
Yeah.

266
00:14:57,530 --> 00:14:59,420
Any other thoughts on the parent?
Yup.

267
00:14:59,660 --> 00:15:02,600
Yeah, I definitely agree with that.
You're saying like anything you,

268
00:15:02,840 --> 00:15:06,380
you guys want to do, like if you
want it bad enough, you can do it.

269
00:15:06,381 --> 00:15:09,050
And I think that's how it was
with my youtube and still is like,

270
00:15:09,051 --> 00:15:12,860
I literally live, breathe youtube.
I'm posting videos every day,

271
00:15:12,861 --> 00:15:17,150
sometimes twice a day, and it's like
taken over my life. But I love it so much.

272
00:15:17,180 --> 00:15:20,540
And I was in school, I went
to Ucla, my dad is really,

273
00:15:20,541 --> 00:15:24,470
really big on education and has
always been like, it's his main thing.

274
00:15:24,471 --> 00:15:28,460
But he saw how passionate I was about
what I was doing and how successful I was

275
00:15:28,461 --> 00:15:31,010
becoming. And I think, you know, if you,

276
00:15:31,011 --> 00:15:35,150
if you have that drive for something and
maybe it's not exactly like what your

277
00:15:35,151 --> 00:15:36,920
parents thank you,
you're going to do it.

278
00:15:36,950 --> 00:15:41,120
I think I'm just going for
like what your heart is saying.

279
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:42,433
Yeah.

280
00:15:42,680 --> 00:15:43,760
That's beautifully said.
Yeah.

281
00:15:43,780 --> 00:15:47,360
I would say to just do your research
and present them with their research and

282
00:15:47,361 --> 00:15:51,620
just kind of like the same reason that
you want to do it and the vision that you

283
00:15:51,621 --> 00:15:55,370
have for just presented
to them. Um, and you know,

284
00:15:55,550 --> 00:16:00,260
research it and show them somebody
that's successful at it already. Um,

285
00:16:00,290 --> 00:16:03,110
and that will be a good way. And
then also just always, you know,

286
00:16:03,111 --> 00:16:06,950
come up with a plan. So maybe it is that
you do end up having to go to college.

287
00:16:07,240 --> 00:16:08,750
Um, and for, you know,

288
00:16:08,780 --> 00:16:12,650
something that maybe more career
driven and now your passion,

289
00:16:12,890 --> 00:16:16,820
well then maybe your plan is that you'll
use that career to fuel your passion or

290
00:16:16,821 --> 00:16:19,220
to fund your passion. So
it's about like, you know,

291
00:16:19,310 --> 00:16:22,490
having a plan as long as you have
a plane and you know exactly,

292
00:16:22,491 --> 00:16:25,850
you know where you want to go at the end.
I think that's most important.

293
00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:26,731
That's amazing.

294
00:16:26,731 --> 00:16:29,520
I think a lot of you guys talked about
mentorship and like looping in older

295
00:16:29,521 --> 00:16:33,210
people and I think there's a quote that's,
it's great to learn from your mistake,

296
00:16:33,211 --> 00:16:36,510
but it's even better to learn
from somebody else's. Right.

297
00:16:36,750 --> 00:16:41,700
And that's what mentorship gives you. You
can tweet that one out too. Um, and I,

298
00:16:42,390 --> 00:16:45,200
so I want to talk about, you know,
a lot of people talk about hustle.

299
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:49,440
Like a lot of people say go out
there, go hard. Like, yeah, eat,

300
00:16:49,441 --> 00:16:52,960
sleep and drink your work. You guys
have all done it. I think that the,

301
00:16:52,970 --> 00:16:56,760
the thing that would make
it really specific and add
a lot of color to it is if

302
00:16:56,761 --> 00:16:59,970
you guys could tell maybe
a story of something like
now some of you got millions

303
00:16:59,971 --> 00:17:03,420
of subscribers, you're reaching so many
people every day. Let's rewind back.

304
00:17:03,510 --> 00:17:07,350
Like what's the story of, you know,
a moment where something click,

305
00:17:07,500 --> 00:17:10,380
you did something, you put in the
work that other people didn't.

306
00:17:10,500 --> 00:17:12,660
I think the more specific we get here,

307
00:17:12,840 --> 00:17:17,700
it will really add a lot of color to
what you have to do to get here because

308
00:17:17,701 --> 00:17:20,340
it's more than just saying nice
things is actually doing them.

309
00:17:20,460 --> 00:17:24,700
And you guys have all
done it. Go ahead. Yeah.

310
00:17:25,550 --> 00:17:25,790
Um,

311
00:17:25,790 --> 00:17:29,600
so before Youtube I actually went to film,
which is a fashion school.

312
00:17:29,601 --> 00:17:32,540
I've loved fashion since
I was in high school. Um,

313
00:17:33,290 --> 00:17:36,320
and I see when I discovered youtube,

314
00:17:36,321 --> 00:17:39,410
I actually discovered it because my
husband was like, oh, there's this video.

315
00:17:39,411 --> 00:17:40,520
I didn't even know what youtube was,

316
00:17:40,521 --> 00:17:45,170
but I went on youtube and then some
high trickled across a beauty video.

317
00:17:45,171 --> 00:17:47,090
It was a haul video.
And I became,

318
00:17:47,120 --> 00:17:51,660
I instantly became fascinated with the
fact that somebody can actually share the

319
00:17:51,661 --> 00:17:52,560
things that they were buying.

320
00:17:52,561 --> 00:17:57,470
But then I always see things
from a business perspective
at back then, uh, the,

321
00:17:57,570 --> 00:18:00,870
the video that I was watching, I think
it had about 20,000 views and I said,

322
00:18:00,871 --> 00:18:05,430
oh my Gosh, if 20,000 people saw
this video of her hall video,

323
00:18:05,790 --> 00:18:08,490
then if 1% of these people,
actually,

324
00:18:08,491 --> 00:18:11,970
if I had a website and 20,000 people
can watch the stuff that I saw on my

325
00:18:11,971 --> 00:18:13,920
website and 1% would go on my website,

326
00:18:13,921 --> 00:18:16,500
then that's like so many people
that can buy stuff for my website.

327
00:18:16,500 --> 00:18:19,110
So I always saw it from a
business perspective. So then I,

328
00:18:19,320 --> 00:18:22,560
my husband bought me a computer and I
started filming my videos at home and

329
00:18:22,590 --> 00:18:24,900
obviously I thought it was going
to be like an instant sensation,

330
00:18:24,901 --> 00:18:29,100
but nobody was watching my videos and
I would speak, I was very frustrated.

331
00:18:29,101 --> 00:18:33,780
I did it for about two years and I had
a thousand subscribers and I would stay

332
00:18:33,781 --> 00:18:36,270
up till like three,
four in the morning and I would Google.

333
00:18:36,271 --> 00:18:37,920
How can I get more views on my videos?

334
00:18:37,921 --> 00:18:41,340
What hashtags should I use on my videos
or what tags should I put on my videos?

335
00:18:41,670 --> 00:18:46,670
I would not sleep because I wanted this
so bad and I had to figure out a way to

336
00:18:46,711 --> 00:18:47,041
do it.

337
00:18:47,041 --> 00:18:50,340
And despite the fact that nobody was
watching my videos and people would laugh

338
00:18:50,341 --> 00:18:52,530
at me for still filming
and uploading and editing,

339
00:18:52,980 --> 00:18:56,580
I was still doing it because it was
something that I truly, truly loved. Um,

340
00:18:56,700 --> 00:19:01,110
fast forward about three years after that,
uh, my brother said, you know, they do,

341
00:19:01,111 --> 00:19:05,150
they make these videos in Spanish.
And the first thing I did was I went into,

342
00:19:05,190 --> 00:19:08,550
into youtube and I typed
in what's in my bag.

343
00:19:08,560 --> 00:19:10,470
That was one of the big
popular videos back then.

344
00:19:10,471 --> 00:19:13,260
It was about a hundred
thousand videos came up.

345
00:19:13,680 --> 00:19:17,070
And then I typed in [inaudible],
which is the same exact thing,

346
00:19:17,100 --> 00:19:22,100
but in Spanish and it was about
300 videos and I speak Spanish.

347
00:19:22,801 --> 00:19:26,640
So then I thought to myself,
this market has not been tapped into.

348
00:19:26,970 --> 00:19:30,210
So I started uploading videos in Spanish.
I didn't give up.

349
00:19:30,211 --> 00:19:32,820
I didn't give up on the fact
that I'm uploading, I'm applying.

350
00:19:32,830 --> 00:19:35,370
I was trying to figure out
ways on how I can get in there.

351
00:19:35,820 --> 00:19:40,500
My Youtube channel now has over,
it has 1.3 million subscribers.

352
00:19:40,810 --> 00:19:41,643
If you would have,

353
00:19:43,940 --> 00:19:48,510
if you guys would have told me that I was
going to have a, a channel that big, um,

354
00:19:48,540 --> 00:19:51,510
you know, four or five years ago,
I would have been like, yeah,

355
00:19:51,511 --> 00:19:52,680
I'm dreaming about it,

356
00:19:52,681 --> 00:19:55,050
but I don't think I'm actually going to
ever get there because no one's watching

357
00:19:55,051 --> 00:19:58,350
my stuff. So, um, I don't even
remember what the question was.

358
00:19:58,450 --> 00:20:01,500
But if you guys the story of Hustle,
yes,

359
00:20:02,160 --> 00:20:05,760
I did not sleep trying to figure out how
I can make this happen because I truly

360
00:20:05,761 --> 00:20:09,210
wanted it. And I guess more of the
story is if you guys want something,

361
00:20:09,240 --> 00:20:12,120
even if you know, it doesn't seem
like it's going to happen for you,

362
00:20:12,121 --> 00:20:16,290
I promise if you guys keep working at it,
you eat, breathe, sleep, your passion,

363
00:20:16,320 --> 00:20:18,040
you guys will make so

364
00:20:19,820 --> 00:20:21,500
[inaudible]

365
00:20:23,230 --> 00:20:24,063
any other stories?

366
00:20:24,800 --> 00:20:27,740
Well, for me, before Youtube I was working

367
00:20:27,760 --> 00:20:31,510
being at Disneyland. Yeah. Yeah.

368
00:20:31,511 --> 00:20:36,440
The happiest place on
earth. Oh, they say. Um,

369
00:20:36,580 --> 00:20:41,380
but no. Um, I just remember, uh,
when I started working at Disneyland,

370
00:20:41,381 --> 00:20:41,950
I started,
yeah,

371
00:20:41,950 --> 00:20:43,270
my youtube channel.

372
00:20:43,420 --> 00:20:47,860
But I will always find myself sketching
out outfits at the register and I'm just

373
00:20:47,861 --> 00:20:48,694
like,

374
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:51,670
you know, there'll be a time to clock
out and I'll be like, all right.

375
00:20:51,671 --> 00:20:54,760
And then I'm scrubbing the gutters.
I'm just like, why am I doing this?

376
00:20:54,761 --> 00:20:55,870
It's not fun.

377
00:20:56,230 --> 00:21:01,230
So what I did was I took my last paycheck
and that's when I started my business.

378
00:21:03,070 --> 00:21:06,340
And so it kind of launched from there.

379
00:21:06,341 --> 00:21:11,341
And then I took a percentage of that
their last paycheck and then I used it for

380
00:21:12,131 --> 00:21:16,000
my youtube to invest in, you
know, better equipment material.

381
00:21:16,330 --> 00:21:20,230
And so from there everything
seems to work out for me.

382
00:21:20,231 --> 00:21:23,770
But Youtube definitely
takes a lot of hard work,

383
00:21:24,160 --> 00:21:29,050
a lot of hard work. Um, I find
myself sewing at five in the morning,

384
00:21:29,051 --> 00:21:31,720
but it's so fun.
Oh my God.

385
00:21:31,950 --> 00:21:36,220
Like I'm sowing and it just like,
it doesn't feel like work.

386
00:21:36,221 --> 00:21:41,010
I mean it's fine. So basically what
I'm trying to say is if you're,

387
00:21:41,020 --> 00:21:43,120
you have a passion about something,

388
00:21:43,121 --> 00:21:48,100
definitely go and do it because that's
like the best thing you could do.

389
00:21:48,510 --> 00:21:50,100
Absolutely.
And if I get build on,

390
00:21:50,120 --> 00:21:53,130
I think that you touched on
something very important,

391
00:21:53,131 --> 00:21:55,740
which is what do you
guys procrastinate with?

392
00:21:56,040 --> 00:22:00,780
Cause that's probably what
you're passionate about. Right?

393
00:22:01,410 --> 00:22:04,960
But you spend the free time, I will do
some audience Q and a after this. Yep. So,

394
00:22:05,020 --> 00:22:09,780
so you, you like, there's a lot of
things that yeah, like growing up,

395
00:22:09,810 --> 00:22:12,870
people tell you to do a lot of things,
especially when you're at your age. Right?

396
00:22:13,170 --> 00:22:16,110
But the thing that you should probably
be doing is what you're most passionate

397
00:22:16,111 --> 00:22:19,110
about. If you find yourself coding
until the wee hours of the night,

398
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:21,180
he should probably be a coder.
You know,

399
00:22:21,300 --> 00:22:24,060
don't fight your instincts like
there's a place for everyone.

400
00:22:24,240 --> 00:22:27,680
And just like you did,
like if you have a job and like you,

401
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:31,440
at some point you will have to find a way
to make ends meet, find inbetween work.

402
00:22:31,470 --> 00:22:32,221
But you know,

403
00:22:32,221 --> 00:22:35,070
if you find yourself doing that in
your free time and procrastinating,

404
00:22:35,220 --> 00:22:38,220
then that's probably what you should be
doing as a profession. And there's a way,

405
00:22:38,221 --> 00:22:39,090
like,
we're lucky.

406
00:22:39,091 --> 00:22:42,600
So we are so lucky to live in this day
and age where you could turn that into

407
00:22:42,601 --> 00:22:46,350
something that has an audience and
reach people all around the world. Um,

408
00:22:46,440 --> 00:22:49,290
I think I also want to point out
from your story, uh, uh, the,

409
00:22:49,330 --> 00:22:54,210
the words overnight success, that's a
total oxymoron, right? That does that.

410
00:22:54,330 --> 00:22:55,141
There's no such a thing.

411
00:22:55,141 --> 00:22:59,760
It takes years to be an overnight success
and that's how people perceive you. Um,

412
00:22:59,761 --> 00:23:01,770
so I see it [inaudible] part
of my day job. You know,

413
00:23:01,810 --> 00:23:03,990
like a lot of people start on youtube.
They're very excited,

414
00:23:04,140 --> 00:23:06,450
but they don't have the dedication
and alive. You guys all did.

415
00:23:07,650 --> 00:23:09,210
It sounds like we'll
open it to the audience.

416
00:23:09,211 --> 00:23:12,540
I want to give you guys a final word
before we opened it up to questions.

417
00:23:12,690 --> 00:23:14,460
Is there anything that you
guys want to talk about?

418
00:23:14,461 --> 00:23:16,560
Like things that you want
to people to know about?

419
00:23:16,561 --> 00:23:18,900
I want to continue the conversation.
If you want to give your,

420
00:23:19,080 --> 00:23:21,930
your Twitter handles or your Instagram
or your youtube channels, anything that,

421
00:23:22,140 --> 00:23:24,480
uh, is, is a good way to keep
in touch with you. Awesome.

422
00:23:24,870 --> 00:23:29,250
Well you guys getting to follow me
on Instagram. Brick eggs, bread to

423
00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:34,830
burdick's Brat too. I think it's on the
and so on though. Yeah, it's all on there.

424
00:23:34,850 --> 00:23:35,490
Um,

425
00:23:35,490 --> 00:23:40,490
and also I heard a host workshops and
classes at Youtube every once a month,

426
00:23:40,770 --> 00:23:45,620
so you guys can check that out
on you to space website. Sorry,

427
00:23:45,800 --> 00:23:46,010
can

428
00:23:46,010 --> 00:23:49,240
I share a little bit on the last port?
Absolutely. Go ahead. Sorry. I just,

429
00:23:49,480 --> 00:23:53,570
I just have to say no need to
apologize. Um, for me. Okay.

430
00:23:53,571 --> 00:23:55,310
So let me tell you all of this.

431
00:23:55,400 --> 00:24:00,170
I have a fraction of the
number of subscribers of, of
these beautiful ladies on,

432
00:24:00,171 --> 00:24:03,850
on the panel and, um, and but yes,

433
00:24:04,190 --> 00:24:05,540
but look out for the collab.

434
00:24:06,050 --> 00:24:10,220
They're all going to collab with John
Phenom at some point. Um, hope. All right.

435
00:24:10,430 --> 00:24:13,370
But uh, here's what I want to say is, uh,

436
00:24:13,390 --> 00:24:17,000
I'm the co I was the guy
where people would say, hell,
my friend designs clothing.

437
00:24:17,001 --> 00:24:20,990
And so I get a random call from so and
so and I'd be, they'd be like, Hey,

438
00:24:20,991 --> 00:24:23,600
I'm so and so's friend and I'm trying to
start a clothing line. I'm like, okay,

439
00:24:23,601 --> 00:24:26,720
cool. Uh, what do you need to know?
So when I started my youtube channel,

440
00:24:27,050 --> 00:24:30,170
I just put up 20 videos of what I would
always tell people to do in terms of

441
00:24:30,171 --> 00:24:33,230
starting a brand. And I was,
it was funny cause I was like,

442
00:24:33,231 --> 00:24:34,580
no one's ever going to watch this.

443
00:24:34,581 --> 00:24:38,000
I get like a hundred views in
like all month or something. So,

444
00:24:38,001 --> 00:24:39,590
but I would say go to
this youtube channel.

445
00:24:39,800 --> 00:24:41,390
And when I stepped away
from it for a while,

446
00:24:41,391 --> 00:24:43,610
it came back and there was
like a thousand subscribers.

447
00:24:43,611 --> 00:24:45,440
So saw people wanted the information.

448
00:24:45,770 --> 00:24:49,730
And so now I'll do a lot of consulting
and they'll come from my base of people

449
00:24:49,731 --> 00:24:52,540
looking for the information.
So for me that,

450
00:24:52,570 --> 00:24:55,580
that's where something kind of clicked
and I realized I could actually offer

451
00:24:55,581 --> 00:24:59,390
value. Um, uh, but yeah, so just
want to share that and for me,

452
00:24:59,660 --> 00:25:03,980
if you just Google oh wow. I just said
if you Google at Google, that is crazy.

453
00:25:05,750 --> 00:25:08,910
That's crazy. That's crazy. Um,

454
00:25:09,140 --> 00:25:13,610
you can Google and you'll find,
you'll find me. And then my,

455
00:25:13,640 --> 00:25:16,010
my youtube channel is
Ford Slash John Fino.

456
00:25:20,450 --> 00:25:21,283
Thanks Jack.

457
00:25:24,980 --> 00:25:27,350
Any other thoughts before we open it up?
Are the things you guys want to say?

458
00:25:27,560 --> 00:25:30,230
I think I just want to leave you
guys with this last little bit.

459
00:25:30,530 --> 00:25:32,930
With social media, we are, you know,

460
00:25:32,990 --> 00:25:37,430
watching each other and oftentimes we'll
start to compare ourselves to, you know,

461
00:25:37,670 --> 00:25:40,730
people that we see and they may
inspire us and we'll say, oh, you know,

462
00:25:40,731 --> 00:25:43,040
like I want to do what they do.
I want to be like them,

463
00:25:43,041 --> 00:25:44,720
but like I would never be able to do that.

464
00:25:45,290 --> 00:25:48,910
You have to always remember that
they had a story and they had a,

465
00:25:49,340 --> 00:25:51,620
they were in the same position
that you were at one point,

466
00:25:51,621 --> 00:25:54,040
but they had to make the decision
and have courage enough to,

467
00:25:54,090 --> 00:25:57,290
to go after what they want it
to do and believe in themselves.

468
00:25:57,291 --> 00:25:58,820
So a lot of times with social media,

469
00:25:58,821 --> 00:26:03,710
you have to shut it off in a sense
that you have to look at yourself as an

470
00:26:03,711 --> 00:26:08,711
individual and know that you are fully
capable of doing what they had to do.

471
00:26:09,340 --> 00:26:12,420
Um, it's not gonna be easy.
It wasn't easy for them. Um,

472
00:26:12,650 --> 00:26:15,560
they have probably many
sleepless nights and you know,

473
00:26:15,561 --> 00:26:16,820
probably want it to give up,

474
00:26:16,821 --> 00:26:21,230
but you always have to be persistent and
always know that you can do whatever it

475
00:26:21,231 --> 00:26:22,730
is that you want to do.
So,

476
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:26,140
and also note social media people
are always only put in there.

477
00:26:26,180 --> 00:26:29,360
You know what they want to
show you. They're not showing
you the back end of it.

478
00:26:29,361 --> 00:26:31,980
They're not showing you the late
nights when you're, you know,

479
00:26:32,420 --> 00:26:35,360
up at five in the morning sewing
or like when you're, you know,

480
00:26:35,570 --> 00:26:37,670
editing your videos so you don't see that.

481
00:26:37,671 --> 00:26:40,850
But you see that amazing
picture or that amazing video.

482
00:26:41,030 --> 00:26:45,450
There's always work,
work that's behind it is never easy,

483
00:26:45,451 --> 00:26:46,350
but you can do it.

484
00:26:47,020 --> 00:26:47,853
Yeah.

485
00:26:53,300 --> 00:26:57,080
Any other thoughts guys? Some
series wisdom he dropped, right?

486
00:26:57,330 --> 00:27:01,710
Oh and follow me on Instagram.

so it makes sure you take me out.

488

Boom. Nice. Nice. Any other
thoughts before we open it up?

489
00:27:10,320 --> 00:27:15,060
I'll plug my socials.
Um, yeah, so my Twitter,

490
00:27:15,061 --> 00:27:15,511
Instagram,

491
00:27:15,511 --> 00:27:19,560
everything's at Chloe couture tour and
then I started a clothing line last year

492
00:27:19,561 --> 00:27:22,560
called glow by Clegg, a tour. So I'm,

493
00:27:22,561 --> 00:27:25,440
that's all on [inaudible] dot com
if you guys want to check that out.

494
00:27:25,960 --> 00:27:29,730
Cool. Awesome. Awesome.
I think we have a boxed,

495
00:27:29,731 --> 00:27:34,180
a pass around for questions. Two
questions. Maybe we will do it.

496
00:27:34,181 --> 00:27:37,240
One from this side. One from
that side. Yup. Do you want
to stand up? Say Your name,

497
00:27:37,241 --> 00:27:38,074
introduce yourself?

498
00:27:39,430 --> 00:27:44,170
I have Khalila I'm from Gala
Girls Academic Leadership Academy.

499
00:27:44,290 --> 00:27:45,123
Oh,
right.

500
00:27:45,480 --> 00:27:46,930
Give it up for her,
for asking the first question.

501
00:27:47,050 --> 00:27:51,270
That's amazing.
That takes courage.

502
00:27:53,360 --> 00:27:57,080
And, um, I just had a
question. Like what would say,

503
00:27:57,140 --> 00:28:00,800
like what would you say your main focus
was when you were like going towards

504
00:28:00,801 --> 00:28:01,634
your goal?

505
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:03,833
Great question.

506
00:28:07,430 --> 00:28:08,360
Think about that one.

507
00:28:09,170 --> 00:28:13,880
Uh, so for me, I'm obviously, I met
this Guy Alioscha who was a designer.

508
00:28:14,060 --> 00:28:16,490
So I would write it everywhere.

509
00:28:16,910 --> 00:28:20,870
I would just tell everybody I'll put out
in the atmosphere that I am a designer.

510
00:28:20,871 --> 00:28:24,740
So I was, I was on my way to becoming a
designer and I was real serious about it.

511
00:28:24,741 --> 00:28:27,560
I didn't breathe until I was,
I became an apparel designer.

512
00:28:27,800 --> 00:28:29,270
Then after that it was other things,

513
00:28:29,271 --> 00:28:30,940
creative director and all
of that sort of thing.

514
00:28:38,140 --> 00:28:40,090
Uh, my main focus, uh,

515
00:28:40,120 --> 00:28:43,240
well when I started you to my
main focus was always a business.

516
00:28:43,241 --> 00:28:46,930
I always knew that I wanted
to have my own business. Um,

517
00:28:46,990 --> 00:28:50,680
so I always made sure to keep that
in mind and whatever, whatever I did.

518
00:28:50,681 --> 00:28:55,210
So I was always figuring out a way how
I can leverage what I had and actually

519
00:28:55,211 --> 00:28:58,990
turn it into a business. So always
owning my own company was my goal.

520
00:29:00,040 --> 00:29:00,873
Amazing.

521
00:29:03,350 --> 00:29:04,630
I think for me,
um,

522
00:29:04,760 --> 00:29:07,850
something that's always been my focus
and always will be my focus is getting

523
00:29:07,851 --> 00:29:08,684
better.

524
00:29:08,690 --> 00:29:11,810
And that's like at first it was getting
better with makeup and then getting

525
00:29:11,811 --> 00:29:16,040
better with my video quality and now
it's just getting better as a person and

526
00:29:16,280 --> 00:29:19,580
learning how to convey that and
spread the message to you guys.

527
00:29:20,350 --> 00:29:21,183
Amazing.

528
00:29:23,790 --> 00:29:25,680
I think a lot of them sounds

529
00:29:25,680 --> 00:29:26,850
when we started with the goal,

530
00:29:26,851 --> 00:29:31,851
we think of the end result and you have
to use that as fuel to get you there.

531
00:29:33,030 --> 00:29:36,720
Cause you know there's the hard
work in between. But also, you know,

532
00:29:36,721 --> 00:29:40,500
remember that their shining moment that
you see yourself in or whatever it is

533
00:29:40,501 --> 00:29:44,230
that that goal is at the end. How you see
yourself remember that and use that as,

534
00:29:44,570 --> 00:29:49,450
as Ammo to just, you know,
really work hard and go after it.

535
00:29:49,790 --> 00:29:50,571
Yeah,
absolutely.

536
00:29:50,571 --> 00:29:53,600
And there's actually a lot of studies
that show if you visualize yourself

537
00:29:53,750 --> 00:29:56,750
attaining the goal,
you're much more likely to get it.

538
00:29:56,810 --> 00:29:59,090
So if you begin with the end in mind,
you'll be ahead.

539
00:29:59,830 --> 00:30:02,980
Yeah. And for me, um,
when I started youtube,

540
00:30:03,100 --> 00:30:07,790
it was definitely also to be a
better designer. Am a lot of,

541
00:30:07,810 --> 00:30:10,750
I was, I was actually going
to school for fashion design,

542
00:30:10,751 --> 00:30:12,490
but I felt like I wasn't learning enough.

543
00:30:12,760 --> 00:30:16,570
So that's when I kind of took a break
from school and just started teaching

544
00:30:16,571 --> 00:30:21,290
myself techniques and then that's when
I Brung it to you too. And so, um, yeah,

545
00:30:21,291 --> 00:30:25,660
it w two is all about me teaching
people from all over the world.

546
00:30:25,870 --> 00:30:27,850
And I know a lot of you
guys are in high schools,

547
00:30:27,851 --> 00:30:30,830
so I know prom season we'll
be coming up for you guys.

548
00:30:30,831 --> 00:30:33,250
So if you want to learn how
to make yes right there,

549
00:30:33,490 --> 00:30:36,100
if you're going to learn how to make
your own prom dress and the guys,

550
00:30:36,101 --> 00:30:40,320
I have clothes for you guys to my channel.
I'm just saying

551
00:30:41,320 --> 00:30:43,830
I love it. Any other thoughts
before we go to the next question?

552
00:30:44,630 --> 00:30:47,630
I agree a lot on the visualizing thing.
I've,

553
00:30:47,631 --> 00:30:51,530
I've always visualized every single
goal through this entire process.

554
00:30:51,531 --> 00:30:55,250
Like my first thing was that I really
wanted to get to 100 subscribers and

555
00:30:55,251 --> 00:30:58,010
everyone doubted me and laughed at
me and said I wasn't going to do it.

556
00:30:58,190 --> 00:31:01,880
But I knew in the back of my head like
I just was picturing myself with the a

557
00:31:01,880 --> 00:31:05,150
hundred subscribers. I already went out
and bought, I was going to do a giveaway.

558
00:31:05,151 --> 00:31:07,100
I like bought it before I even got them.

559
00:31:07,101 --> 00:31:11,300
So just really like putting yourself
in that place and like acting like you

560
00:31:11,301 --> 00:31:14,420
already have it is a big key to success.

561
00:31:14,530 --> 00:31:19,360
Amazing. Great Advice. Thanks. Very
question. Ah, we'll do one more.

562
00:31:21,270 --> 00:31:21,830
Cool.

563
00:31:21,830 --> 00:31:23,240
Right here. Oh, we okay.

565
00:31:31,640 --> 00:31:34,490

name? What's your question?

566
00:31:34,850 --> 00:31:37,610
My name is honey Tokyo Masha Gay.

567
00:31:37,650 --> 00:31:40,700
I'm from Alliance Bloomfield high school.

568
00:31:41,090 --> 00:31:44,900
And my question is what really
inspires you to do this for you?

569
00:31:45,730 --> 00:31:47,030
Ooh,
great question.

570
00:31:48,790 --> 00:31:52,240
Sometimes it's when you figure
out what you don't want to do,

571
00:31:53,400 --> 00:31:57,730
that in spa will lead you to what it
is that you do want to do. So for me,

572
00:31:57,731 --> 00:32:02,500
you know, graduating in, you know,
becoming a pharmacist and then,

573
00:32:02,680 --> 00:32:07,050
you know, at work I was bored. I
was, you know, I was like, mmm,

574
00:32:07,090 --> 00:32:10,300
this is boring. You know, it's
good money but it's boring.

575
00:32:10,301 --> 00:32:15,301
So sometimes it's what you don't want to
do when you're in that place where you

576
00:32:15,671 --> 00:32:19,320
know, okay, I don't want to
be here. That's what you know,

577
00:32:19,390 --> 00:32:23,590
drives you or gives you the idea or
stirs you up enough to say, okay,

578
00:32:23,591 --> 00:32:25,090
what is it that I do want to do?

579
00:32:25,810 --> 00:32:28,600
That's amazing.
All high school students,

580
00:32:28,900 --> 00:32:31,960
high school students should hear what you
just said. That's amazing. It's so true.

581
00:32:32,080 --> 00:32:35,260
What do you guys think
about that question? What
inspires you? What's your why?

582
00:32:36,700 --> 00:32:41,210
MMM, well for me, um, like I said,
I always had a passion for fashion.

583
00:32:41,510 --> 00:32:44,690
Um, I definitely feel like if you
put anything out on social media,

584
00:32:44,720 --> 00:32:49,280
definitely do something that you enjoy
and don't do it because it's trending or

585
00:32:49,281 --> 00:32:52,160
is the next popular thing. But, um,

586
00:32:52,161 --> 00:32:57,161
I just really enjoy doing what I do is
like just waking up every day sewing,

587
00:32:58,790 --> 00:33:03,320
making videos for youtube and seeing
all the work that people send to me from

588
00:33:03,321 --> 00:33:05,840
all over the world. He
just, I really enjoy it.

589
00:33:07,560 --> 00:33:10,950
Uh, w what I want to say for you guys
individually when you guys are thinking,

590
00:33:10,980 --> 00:33:13,200
because everybody's thinking
about how does this apply to me?

591
00:33:13,650 --> 00:33:16,830
So it's once you guys go on your journey
and it doesn't matter what age you are,

592
00:33:16,860 --> 00:33:19,200
you know, like I had a friend
told me the other day, he's like,

593
00:33:19,230 --> 00:33:23,520
he's 35 and he's like, I hate my job.
I don't want to do this. Help me John.

594
00:33:23,790 --> 00:33:26,490
So it's the same thing that I
would tell like a 16 year old kid.

595
00:33:26,700 --> 00:33:30,510
You have to get familiar with the
things that you love and don't love,

596
00:33:30,511 --> 00:33:33,240
just like you were saying.
And then when you get on your journey,

597
00:33:33,241 --> 00:33:37,020
like you might go into one
job and figure out, wow,

598
00:33:37,021 --> 00:33:39,300
I don't like this or I
don't like this situation.

599
00:33:39,301 --> 00:33:41,290
Maybe if you pivot it and change it,
um,

600
00:33:41,550 --> 00:33:43,200
there's another thing
that that you'll love.

601
00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:44,970
That's why I've tried so
many different things.

602
00:33:44,971 --> 00:33:47,070
Like I probably have 10
versions of my resume,

603
00:33:47,071 --> 00:33:50,430
but it all kind of culminates
with fashion and Oh,

604
00:33:50,431 --> 00:33:53,840
another thing that I'll always tell people
is when you do find what you want to

605
00:33:53,850 --> 00:33:55,290
do,
um,

606
00:33:55,350 --> 00:33:59,430
find the best mentor possible
who's doing it. Okay.

607
00:33:59,431 --> 00:34:04,431
Like there's a reason why someone is
first in their field and someone is 226th

608
00:34:04,980 --> 00:34:08,850
at the same industry, the same job. Right.

609
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:14,000
Like I would pay money for to intern with
someone who's number one or maybe they

610
00:34:14,641 --> 00:34:17,190
have a huge ego and I don't like that.
So I go with number six.

611
00:34:17,360 --> 00:34:19,850
Do you see what I'm saying?
Because at the end of that,

612
00:34:19,860 --> 00:34:23,580
I don't want to compromise, you know, I
don't want to devil wears Prada situation,

613
00:34:23,581 --> 00:34:26,280
wouldn't me? Cause that wouldn't, that
movie wouldn't end like that for me.

614
00:34:27,060 --> 00:34:31,800
Where's the camera for real? It would
end like that. I'm Filipino for real. So,

615
00:34:32,070 --> 00:34:32,580
um,

616
00:34:32,580 --> 00:34:37,230
what what I'm saying saying for
you guys is find that best mentor.

617
00:34:37,380 --> 00:34:40,820
Learn everything you can
from them because when they,

618
00:34:40,830 --> 00:34:42,480
their psychology is different.

619
00:34:42,720 --> 00:34:46,290
When they wake up and when she's doing
her youtube, she has 3.2 million,

620
00:34:46,291 --> 00:34:49,530
y'all 3.2 million subs don't sleep on it.

621
00:34:49,890 --> 00:34:52,350
So when she wakes up in the morning,

622
00:34:52,530 --> 00:34:57,180
her psychology is different than someone
who has way less subs in that the

623
00:34:57,181 --> 00:35:01,470
designer, architect, whatever
it is you guys, realtor,
whatever you guys want to be,

624
00:35:01,920 --> 00:35:06,150
there's someone who has a psychology
and if you success leaves clues.

625
00:35:06,480 --> 00:35:08,250
So if you grab some of those clues,

626
00:35:08,400 --> 00:35:12,540
it will expedite your career
by decades and by money.

627
00:35:12,541 --> 00:35:16,920
Y'all tons of money. So like, and
that's not necessarily the, the,

628
00:35:16,921 --> 00:35:20,730
the push for it. Okay. It's about
being happy with your life, right?

629
00:35:20,731 --> 00:35:23,250
Because studies show at about 80 90 grand.

630
00:35:23,251 --> 00:35:26,460
You can kind of get everything you want
in your life. So you guys are young.

631
00:35:26,461 --> 00:35:29,220
You'll be like, I want to be rich,
I want to be a baller. You know?

632
00:35:29,430 --> 00:35:33,360
But it's in time. You'll see, but
it's about finding a mentor and then,

633
00:35:33,420 --> 00:35:34,360
and then getting the,

634
00:35:34,860 --> 00:35:37,890
getting the clues of success from
them to really your career up.

635
00:35:39,660 --> 00:35:41,910
Great.
I think we're going to start wrapping up,

636
00:35:42,030 --> 00:35:44,250
unless you guys have any
quick thoughts to drop in.

637
00:35:44,940 --> 00:35:46,530
Any quick thoughts before we wrap up?

638
00:35:47,510 --> 00:35:51,830
Cool. Um, I want to say thanks so much
for coming out and the ending note,

639
00:35:51,831 --> 00:35:54,050
I want to say this is not
the end of the conversation.

640
00:35:54,051 --> 00:35:57,110
It's very much at the beginning.
Uh, look us up on your program.

641
00:35:57,290 --> 00:36:01,610
Add us on social media, come

event we want to talk to you,

642
00:36:01,611 --> 00:36:03,440
we want to help you with
while I'm paid forward,

643
00:36:03,590 --> 00:36:06,230
I want to give it up one more time
for our, our amazing panelists.
