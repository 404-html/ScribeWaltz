1
00:00:05,750 --> 00:00:10,730
Hello everybody. I'm so excited to be
here with you today. A couple of things.

2
00:00:11,090 --> 00:00:15,020
One to make sure we have a dialogue
because if all I do is talk to you about

3
00:00:15,830 --> 00:00:19,190
maybe a few nightmares,
maybe a few scary things,

4
00:00:19,191 --> 00:00:21,530
tell you a few White House stories
and that's all that happened,

5
00:00:21,980 --> 00:00:23,390
then I only did half my job.

6
00:00:23,391 --> 00:00:27,080
So I want to make sure that you
feel like you can ask me questions.

7
00:00:27,110 --> 00:00:31,940
And for those of you that
are live streaming in your
questions are going to be

8
00:00:31,941 --> 00:00:33,320
moderated by Heather.

9
00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:37,130
And we were talking about making sure
everybody's questions get answered.

10
00:00:37,131 --> 00:00:40,310
We're going to find a way to do that
even if we run out of our time together.

11
00:00:40,610 --> 00:00:42,980
And then for those of
you that are in the room,

12
00:00:42,981 --> 00:00:47,981
your incentive plan is to ask a question
and the first one to ask a question,

13
00:00:48,291 --> 00:00:52,190
you get a signed copy of my book,
which my mother says is a must read.

14
00:00:52,580 --> 00:00:57,480
And uh, and then if you don't
ask questions and you're
too shy to ask questions,

15
00:00:57,481 --> 00:00:59,330
then I ask random people random questions.

16
00:00:59,331 --> 00:01:02,270
So that's your incentive plan
for asking me a question.

17
00:01:02,271 --> 00:01:04,280
I really want to make
sure we have a dialogue.

18
00:01:04,670 --> 00:01:07,310
I'm really honored to
be here with all of you.

19
00:01:07,311 --> 00:01:12,020
For those of you who are live streaming
in as a view who were here in person. Uh,

20
00:01:12,050 --> 00:01:17,000
Google is one of the power brokers of
the world and I'm a big fan of Google.

21
00:01:17,001 --> 00:01:21,920
I've also held Google, uh, accountable.
I'm in talking about privacy and security,

22
00:01:22,250 --> 00:01:26,480
but I'm a big fan. As a matter of fact,
I power our company's infrastructure.

23
00:01:26,481 --> 00:01:29,300
A big part of it is on the Google cloud.

24
00:01:29,330 --> 00:01:33,340
So big fan of Google and I want to
push you out of your comfort zone.

25
00:01:33,341 --> 00:01:35,510
So when I talked to the
people putting on this event,

26
00:01:35,870 --> 00:01:39,530
one of the things they said is try out
some new concepts and new ideas and I'm

27
00:01:39,531 --> 00:01:41,180
going to do that today.
Uh,

28
00:01:41,181 --> 00:01:45,400
disagreement is always welcome so
you don't have to agree with me. I'm,

29
00:01:45,410 --> 00:01:49,640
the only way I'm going to learn is for
people to share alternative points of

30
00:01:49,641 --> 00:01:54,380
view and idea. So your questions
can be anything, any topic,

31
00:01:54,410 --> 00:01:57,470
and feel free to push back on anything
that you hear me talk about today.

32
00:01:57,970 --> 00:02:00,500
A couple of quick pictures
from the family scrapbook.

33
00:02:00,740 --> 00:02:04,460
So you'll see in the family photo,
I've got my two sons, Kiran and Aiden.

34
00:02:04,470 --> 00:02:08,030
I'm actually seven months pregnant
with my little girl made there and the

35
00:02:08,031 --> 00:02:09,770
gentleman next to me
with his arm around me,

36
00:02:09,771 --> 00:02:13,970
that's President Bush and the dude next
to him. That's actually my husband. Um,

37
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:18,920
then you have another picture of, uh, the
White House press briefing room, podium.

38
00:02:19,310 --> 00:02:23,270
And you can probably tell I'm actually
holding up my son and decking behind him.

39
00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:28,090
And I love that picture because, you know,
it's one of those things where my, um,

40
00:02:28,490 --> 00:02:31,700
I commuted every week for two and a half
years. I don't know if you know this,

41
00:02:31,701 --> 00:02:36,701
but the shelf life of a political
appointee CIO is roughly 12 to 14 months.

42
00:02:37,850 --> 00:02:39,410
I did it for two and a half years.

43
00:02:39,411 --> 00:02:44,411
So that either says I'm
crazy or determined and
stubborn or maybe a little bit

44
00:02:44,661 --> 00:02:48,410
of all of the above. Uh, but sometimes
instead of me commuting home,

45
00:02:48,411 --> 00:02:52,010
my family would actually come to see me
and the senior staff really encouraged

46
00:02:52,011 --> 00:02:56,900
for them to come and experience the
White House as I experienced it.

47
00:02:57,140 --> 00:03:00,430
And so on this particular day,
actually, kids were like, mom,

48
00:03:00,460 --> 00:03:03,400
you have the coolest job in the world.
And they were right.

49
00:03:03,401 --> 00:03:06,040
And I still have the coolest job in
the world. It's just a different job.

50
00:03:06,430 --> 00:03:10,330
But this particular day they saw the
president land on the South Lawn and Hmx

51
00:03:10,331 --> 00:03:14,620
one the helicopter. Then they saw the
president's dogs, Bernie and Ms. Beasley.

52
00:03:14,621 --> 00:03:16,450
And Barney was outfitted with a camera.

53
00:03:16,450 --> 00:03:19,000
So you could see the White House
from Barneys point of view,

54
00:03:19,300 --> 00:03:23,770
I'm Barney can then people were handing
them presidential mnms everywhere they

55
00:03:23,771 --> 00:03:26,050
went. And they're like,
this job is amazing.

56
00:03:26,051 --> 00:03:30,580
You helped the president
with this computer. You get
to watch helicopters land,

57
00:03:30,581 --> 00:03:33,880
play with dogs and eat m and m's kind of
sounds like Google, doesn't it? Right.

58
00:03:34,090 --> 00:03:37,390
And so, uh, we went into
the press briefing room,

59
00:03:37,690 --> 00:03:40,870
which is one of the few places where
I could actually talk about my job.

60
00:03:40,960 --> 00:03:44,020
And we were doing this major modernization
effort in the press briefing room.

61
00:03:44,440 --> 00:03:47,530
And behind that podium,
which is the president had been there,

62
00:03:47,531 --> 00:03:51,130
they'd actually be a presidential seal
on the podium and its nickname is called

63
00:03:51,131 --> 00:03:52,000
the blue goose.

64
00:03:52,330 --> 00:03:57,280
But behind that is almost its own
little city of cables and wires and uh,

65
00:03:57,400 --> 00:04:01,360
programs running things from the blue
goose. My kids are bored at this point.

66
00:04:01,570 --> 00:04:04,660
So my oldest turns to me, those were
getting ready to leave. And he says, Mama,

67
00:04:05,050 --> 00:04:06,520
I really want to tell the news.

68
00:04:06,970 --> 00:04:10,330
And so as I ducked down so my husband
could take that picture of him telling the

69
00:04:10,331 --> 00:04:11,170
news,
it dawned on me,

70
00:04:11,171 --> 00:04:15,370
wouldn't it be great if we let four year
olds give the press briefings in the

71
00:04:15,370 --> 00:04:18,520
White House? I mean, think about
the honesty we would get. Right. Um,

72
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:23,440
and then down at the bottom there's a
picture of me in front of one of the jets

73
00:04:23,441 --> 00:04:24,730
in the Air Force One fleet.

74
00:04:25,390 --> 00:04:30,310
And this is where the job that you have
and the job that I had are actually not

75
00:04:30,311 --> 00:04:34,180
too different. So if you think
about the White House for starters,

76
00:04:35,020 --> 00:04:38,050
the 3000 staff that worked for the
executive office of the president,

77
00:04:38,051 --> 00:04:41,320
they're barely ever at the White House.
We don't all fit in the White House.

78
00:04:41,321 --> 00:04:45,550
It was built for kinder, gentler,
smaller time in our US government.

79
00:04:46,120 --> 00:04:47,680
They're mobile,
they're global,

80
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:52,480
they deserve and in some cases demand
the latest and greatest technology.

81
00:04:53,110 --> 00:04:57,400
How do you give them the latest and
greatest technology to enable them to do

82
00:04:57,401 --> 00:05:01,990
their jobs without,
for me anyways,

83
00:05:01,991 --> 00:05:05,680
putting a homing beacon and
the president's pocket was
not an ideal thing to do

84
00:05:05,920 --> 00:05:08,140
for you. It might be a little
different what you're worried about,

85
00:05:08,141 --> 00:05:13,141
but you're still worried
about the security and the
privacy in addition to the

86
00:05:13,391 --> 00:05:17,740
functionality. And so if you think about
it, our jobs are not too dissimilar,

87
00:05:17,950 --> 00:05:19,990
right?
And the challenges we face every day.

88
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:23,860
And we're at this really
exciting time in computing.

89
00:05:23,861 --> 00:05:28,060
And Heather and I were talking about
just how amazing it is and we don't even

90
00:05:28,061 --> 00:05:31,270
know what quantum computing is
going to bring for all of us.

91
00:05:31,271 --> 00:05:35,170
And it's exciting and scary at the same
time. And we now have a point where,

92
00:05:35,171 --> 00:05:35,351
you know,

93
00:05:35,351 --> 00:05:39,910
devices are collecting and interacting
with each other on our behalf without

94
00:05:39,911 --> 00:05:40,930
human intervention.

95
00:05:41,140 --> 00:05:46,140
It is an amazing time of innovation and
the technology that's being deployed is

96
00:05:46,241 --> 00:05:48,340
so cool.
So I don't know about you.

97
00:05:48,341 --> 00:05:52,930
When you think about commercial
travel and you think about elegant,

98
00:05:52,931 --> 00:05:56,920
classy service, do you think flying on
airlines these days? Maybe, maybe not.

99
00:05:56,930 --> 00:05:59,180
Probably not.
I mean I think Air Force One,

100
00:05:59,181 --> 00:06:01,000
but I don't fly on that as much anymore.

101
00:06:01,010 --> 00:06:05,000
And so I think you kind of as
second best is virgin airlines.

102
00:06:05,001 --> 00:06:08,510
I think they do a pretty good job whether
you're in first class are in coach.

103
00:06:09,080 --> 00:06:12,230
And so how do they do that? And I looked
into what virgin airlines was doing.

104
00:06:12,231 --> 00:06:16,490
The first thing they did was they've
outfitted every plane with Internet of

105
00:06:16,491 --> 00:06:21,230
things, devices from nose to tail
wing to wing, inside and outside. Now,

106
00:06:21,231 --> 00:06:22,610
that's not to say while they're flying,

107
00:06:22,611 --> 00:06:23,990
they're all communicating
with the Internet.

108
00:06:23,991 --> 00:06:28,991
But the devices are collecting information
and that information is used to think

109
00:06:29,691 --> 00:06:32,870
about safer flying or
their mechanical issues,

110
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:36,320
more economical flying.
So how do I give you elegant,

111
00:06:36,321 --> 00:06:41,321
classy service while having
it be economical at the
same time and being on time.

112
00:06:41,631 --> 00:06:46,070
So on time records, how much data
are they collecting? One plane,

113
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:49,460
one flight is a half a terabyte of data.

114
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:53,000
Now I know this group knows what
a half a terabyte of data is,

115
00:06:53,300 --> 00:06:55,820
but if your mom and dad
asks you what it is,

116
00:06:55,821 --> 00:07:00,821
it's the equivalent of binge watching
250 hours of your favorite shows.

117
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:04,520
One plane, one flight, Virgin Airlines.

118
00:07:04,820 --> 00:07:07,340
That is a massive amount of data,

119
00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:10,760
but it's really cool how it's being used.
Now,

120
00:07:10,761 --> 00:07:15,290
in some cases where we're headed
with technology can even save lives.

121
00:07:15,770 --> 00:07:18,170
So in the UK they actually
have internet of things,

122
00:07:18,171 --> 00:07:22,160
lamps and these lamps actually
detect glass breaking,

123
00:07:22,490 --> 00:07:25,730
yelling, banging, loud noises,

124
00:07:25,760 --> 00:07:28,730
and the lamps actually
glow brighter and brighter.

125
00:07:29,450 --> 00:07:34,450
In some cases a camera will turn on and
they could deploy physical security if

126
00:07:34,461 --> 00:07:38,570
they need to. These are really cool
and interesting uses of technology.

127
00:07:38,900 --> 00:07:42,740
And then of course Google, not to leave
out Google, we have Google helmet,

128
00:07:42,741 --> 00:07:43,311
my house,

129
00:07:43,311 --> 00:07:46,880
that was actually the employee gift last
year for Christmas for everybody in our

130
00:07:46,881 --> 00:07:50,630
company. Now everything has to be gold.
That's given us the employee gift.

131
00:07:50,631 --> 00:07:53,950
So we had to search for the gold rappers,
which came out later,

132
00:07:53,990 --> 00:07:55,490
but long story about that.

133
00:07:55,640 --> 00:08:00,380
But if you think about sort of the
integration of some of this technology,

134
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:04,280
it's almost to the point where we
don't even realize it's there anymore.

135
00:08:04,760 --> 00:08:09,230
And the opportunity is huge. When you
look at the economic value for the world,

136
00:08:09,231 --> 00:08:14,231
we're looking at possibly $11 trillion
positive impact and we've now outnumber

137
00:08:15,780 --> 00:08:19,100
humans with the number of
Iot devices around the world.

138
00:08:20,330 --> 00:08:24,170
So where do we go from here?
Well,

139
00:08:24,300 --> 00:08:27,380
one of the first things I want you to
be thinking about since it's internet

140
00:08:27,860 --> 00:08:31,400
safety awareness month, right? So
national cybersecurity awareness month,

141
00:08:31,401 --> 00:08:33,590
it's also international cyber
security awareness month.

142
00:08:33,920 --> 00:08:37,220
And this is the 13th year that we're
doing this. Do you guys feel safer?

143
00:08:37,250 --> 00:08:38,600
I don't know about you.
I don't.

144
00:08:39,020 --> 00:08:44,020
I'm so 13 years in lucky 13 first thing
I want you to think about changing is

145
00:08:44,751 --> 00:08:48,230
how many of you have heard
the conventional wisdom that
the human is the weakest

146
00:08:48,231 --> 00:08:52,160
link in security? Right? So,
uh, we all say it. We all say,

147
00:08:52,280 --> 00:08:53,480
I want to change the dialogue.

148
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:58,600
So I want to push back on everybody
here and ask you to question why do we

149
00:09:00,421 --> 00:09:02,730
still,
after over a decade,

150
00:09:02,731 --> 00:09:06,510
we're lie on the human and
say they're the weakest link.

151
00:09:07,340 --> 00:09:11,100
Maybe just maybe I'll
push this idea out to you.

152
00:09:11,460 --> 00:09:14,490
The maybe given the hockey
sticks we have in Cybercrime,

153
00:09:14,730 --> 00:09:17,160
the maybe given the
geopolitics of the world,

154
00:09:17,161 --> 00:09:19,080
and I don't know about you
if you're a history buff,

155
00:09:19,530 --> 00:09:24,270
it's never felt more tense than it has
for me based on what I've read of ancient

156
00:09:24,271 --> 00:09:27,330
history and modern history.
It feels pretty tense to me.

157
00:09:27,331 --> 00:09:30,600
Maybe it's because I'm living in it.
Maybe it's because we're all, you know,

158
00:09:30,601 --> 00:09:31,181
living in it.

159
00:09:31,181 --> 00:09:35,400
It feels more intense to us that maybe
world war one or World War II or the Cold

160
00:09:35,400 --> 00:09:36,233
War,
right?

161
00:09:36,840 --> 00:09:37,280
Okay.

162
00:09:37,280 --> 00:09:42,140
But maybe we should be thinking about,
no, the weakest link is actually us.

163
00:09:42,141 --> 00:09:43,850
I started off as a developer.

164
00:09:44,570 --> 00:09:49,250
Maybe there is a moral imperative
that when we talk about feature and

165
00:09:49,251 --> 00:09:50,210
functionality,

166
00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:54,770
the first thing we should be talking
about is let's not depend on the weakest

167
00:09:54,771 --> 00:09:55,604
link,
the human.

168
00:09:56,570 --> 00:10:01,040
So I'm going to push that out as something
I want each of you to consider is we

169
00:10:01,041 --> 00:10:04,250
need to change that dialogue because
if we keep relying on a human,

170
00:10:04,251 --> 00:10:06,590
we're going to keep failing
and we can't afford to fail.

171
00:10:06,730 --> 00:10:10,820
Cyber criminals have never been,
uh, kind of more organized,

172
00:10:11,480 --> 00:10:16,070
more talented, um, and in
some cases more scalable.

173
00:10:16,490 --> 00:10:19,640
So we're seeing the attacks
cost a lot of money,

174
00:10:19,641 --> 00:10:21,950
so you don't even have
to be technical anymore.

175
00:10:22,220 --> 00:10:24,890
You can buy your way
into attacking companies.

176
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:29,320
And so it all starts with designs.

177
00:10:29,340 --> 00:10:33,480
I really want to push hard on this concept
of how do we think differently about

178
00:10:33,481 --> 00:10:37,920
design? And maybe some of it starts
with thinking about ethical hacking.

179
00:10:38,280 --> 00:10:41,610
So before you even build that piece of
functionality and maybe you bring the

180
00:10:41,611 --> 00:10:45,570
ethical hacker in, not for them to
throw a wet blanket on your fire,

181
00:10:45,571 --> 00:10:50,010
on the great idea that you're trying to
innovate, but to turn to them and say,

182
00:10:50,011 --> 00:10:53,430
so how would you break this before I
even build it? How would you break it?

183
00:10:53,670 --> 00:10:56,790
How would you take advantage
of the human that's using it?

184
00:10:56,791 --> 00:11:01,410
How do we not be relying upon the
human that's the weakest link?

185
00:11:03,100 --> 00:11:03,940
And for me,

186
00:11:03,941 --> 00:11:07,540
I have to tell you what am I
tipping points when I first
got to the White House,

187
00:11:07,570 --> 00:11:07,751
you know,

188
00:11:07,751 --> 00:11:11,530
I used to work in the financial services
industry and so every time bad things

189
00:11:11,531 --> 00:11:14,260
would happen, the financial services
industry, I think to myself,

190
00:11:14,500 --> 00:11:18,640
if I could just get to every user and
if I could just talk to you for a little

191
00:11:18,641 --> 00:11:23,110
bit and train you a little bit better and
write the policies a little bit better,

192
00:11:23,111 --> 00:11:27,340
like life would be so much better. And
that's all it is. It's communications,

193
00:11:27,341 --> 00:11:29,500
it's training.
We just got to do this better.

194
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:32,530
And when I got to the White House
and I realized, okay, wait a minute,

195
00:11:32,590 --> 00:11:35,740
cause there's 3000 people here,
they're global, they're mobile,

196
00:11:35,741 --> 00:11:38,560
just like our banking customers were.
So I didn't think that was two different.

197
00:11:39,340 --> 00:11:42,940
But the threats that we're targeting,
the White House were ever changing.

198
00:11:42,941 --> 00:11:46,900
And I thought if I'm going to try and
brief everybody every day on what I'm

199
00:11:46,901 --> 00:11:51,010
learning is different and I'm going to
hold them accountable for understanding

200
00:11:51,011 --> 00:11:53,080
how to protect themselves,
I'm going to fail.

201
00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:56,920
And that's when I realized I wasn't
always designing for the human.

202
00:11:56,921 --> 00:12:00,070
And I'll talk to you in a little bit
about how to think about designing for the

203
00:12:00,071 --> 00:12:02,500
human. And one of my Aha
moments at the White House.

204
00:12:02,860 --> 00:12:07,860
But I've had a second Aha moment lately
and this really happened to me in the

205
00:12:07,930 --> 00:12:07,931
last year.

206
00:12:07,931 --> 00:12:11,530
And it really came to the forefront
with the discussion around the election

207
00:12:11,531 --> 00:12:12,010
cycle,

208
00:12:12,010 --> 00:12:17,010
not just in the u s but over in
Europe and the potential for Russia,

209
00:12:17,620 --> 00:12:22,620
possibly other countries to use propaganda
to change people's minds and opinions

210
00:12:23,531 --> 00:12:27,790
and potentially have them change
how they vote. And that domain is,

211
00:12:27,791 --> 00:12:29,620
we were so focused on,
okay,

212
00:12:29,621 --> 00:12:32,920
the humans weakest link and we need
to protect the servers and we need to

213
00:12:32,921 --> 00:12:37,540
protect the data and we need to protect
the devices that we forgot to protect

214
00:12:38,460 --> 00:12:40,570
crowdsourcing and crowd thinking.

215
00:12:41,680 --> 00:12:45,520
And so when that effort to be thinking
about how do we reach people and how do

216
00:12:45,521 --> 00:12:50,521
we stay interconnected and how do we
get information in a way that we want to

217
00:12:50,861 --> 00:12:54,430
receive it, that's the most beneficial
to us in that moment that we receive it.

218
00:12:54,430 --> 00:12:56,320
Right?
So if you order something on Amazon,

219
00:12:56,321 --> 00:12:58,990
it tells you what other people
who ordered that ordered.

220
00:12:58,991 --> 00:13:01,480
And a lot of times you think that's
pretty cool, I'd probably need that too.

221
00:13:02,830 --> 00:13:07,570
And that's helpful. But at the same
time, is that technology matured.

222
00:13:07,571 --> 00:13:11,830
It also created unintended echo chambers,
which I'll talk about in a moment,

223
00:13:12,370 --> 00:13:17,370
but I want you to be thinking about the
domain of security has now added a new

224
00:13:18,131 --> 00:13:22,030
domain. So it's not just
data, it's not just devices,

225
00:13:22,210 --> 00:13:23,590
it's not just the humans,

226
00:13:23,591 --> 00:13:28,510
but it's actually the social media content
as well that needs to be protected.

227
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:30,790
And if you read a security briefing,

228
00:13:30,791 --> 00:13:35,791
I don't know how many of you have the
soul crushing pleasure of reading security

229
00:13:36,551 --> 00:13:40,750
reports on a regular basis,
but they all pretty much sound like this.

230
00:13:41,080 --> 00:13:45,250
The Sky is falling.
Data's at risk attacks or worsening,

231
00:13:45,520 --> 00:13:48,970
and the silly user, it's their problem.
They pretty much all sound that way.

232
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:52,840
Now I'm going to show you a couple of
clips from hunted to show you why it's

233
00:13:52,841 --> 00:13:55,930
really not something that
the user can always prevent.

234
00:13:56,410 --> 00:13:57,790
And so what are you going
to see in this first clip?

235
00:13:57,791 --> 00:14:01,390
In a couple of caveats on hunted,
when you see the command center,

236
00:14:01,420 --> 00:14:04,720
none of us are actors and
actresses were just working cases.

237
00:14:04,721 --> 00:14:07,840
We're trying to forget. The cameras
are there, it's not scripted.

238
00:14:08,230 --> 00:14:10,000
And so everything you
see that we're doing,

239
00:14:10,001 --> 00:14:12,670
if we're trying to hack into
an account or get information,

240
00:14:12,671 --> 00:14:14,170
it's all in real time.

241
00:14:15,430 --> 00:14:18,790
So in this first one I'll show you the
video and then I'll explain to you what,

242
00:14:19,270 --> 00:14:19,931
what's going on.

243
00:14:19,931 --> 00:14:24,490
Concrete Intel on David and Emily's
whereabouts did mark NSA analyst,

244
00:14:24,520 --> 00:14:28,180
Landon Stewart attempts to break
into David's online accounts.

245
00:14:28,660 --> 00:14:31,580
And when does your [inaudible] dot
com I'm going to get into Gmail.

246
00:14:32,020 --> 00:14:35,890
Which message? Lumberjack downtown
one. A fugitive goes on the run.

247
00:14:35,891 --> 00:14:37,420
And Mike Pearse thing,
because I'm a cyber guy,

248
00:14:37,421 --> 00:14:39,940
I want to know how to leverage
technology against them.

249
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,970
One of the security questions for a
reset is his favorite sports team.

250
00:14:43,480 --> 00:14:48,070
So what is his favorite sports team?
Charles, let me see here. All right,

251
00:14:48,071 --> 00:14:52,160
Alana is Instagram, which, which sport?

252
00:14:52,161 --> 00:14:55,310
The Lakers.
He's seeing in the Atlanta Braves,

253
00:14:55,311 --> 00:15:00,010
but that's pumping his favorite
Miami heat as photos up. Tracy.

254
00:15:00,080 --> 00:15:03,260
He's from Miami, right? Miami
Heat. That would be my bet.

255
00:15:03,590 --> 00:15:07,610
My only concern is do store
best not to lock him out.

256
00:15:07,700 --> 00:15:10,490
That's why I won't have it verified by
more than one source. Oh, of course.

257
00:15:10,730 --> 00:15:14,270
You guys are saying he too. Yeah, he's
at the game three weeks ago. Let me see.

258
00:15:14,550 --> 00:15:19,100
Mark. Screw skirt. Screw it. Let's try it.

259
00:15:24,290 --> 00:15:28,740
Got It. It's the heat. Oh, you
rock. We'll ask a question.

260
00:15:30,900 --> 00:15:35,250
When did you create this
Google account? Okay, let's,

261
00:15:35,340 --> 00:15:37,150
let's try and be smart about it.
Um,

262
00:15:38,440 --> 00:15:41,730
let me Google the account and see about
when it appears. Just gimme a second.

263
00:15:43,260 --> 00:15:47,310
Let me see here.
Here's the oldest one.

264
00:15:47,311 --> 00:15:51,630
I see it's January of 2014.
It might be the best shot your gun.

265
00:15:52,020 --> 00:15:55,350
This is a crude way of doing, but it's
the best one. I could be that one.

266
00:15:55,440 --> 00:15:56,490
That's no guarantee.

267
00:16:01,350 --> 00:16:06,260
Oh my God, it worked.
We've got all his contacts.

268
00:16:06,470 --> 00:16:09,930
Oh, we have everybody
do it. That's awesome.

269
00:16:10,810 --> 00:16:13,840
Okay, so a couple of things about what
you just saw there. And first of all,

270
00:16:14,290 --> 00:16:16,840
whenever we heard that the
fugitives had a Google account,

271
00:16:16,841 --> 00:16:18,220
we would just grown because we were like,
oh,

272
00:16:18,221 --> 00:16:21,520
based on Google Security
and privacy settings,

273
00:16:21,521 --> 00:16:25,600
they're the hardest ones to get into. And
so we would actually have to file, um,

274
00:16:25,601 --> 00:16:27,430
I'd have to send a
written thing to a judge.

275
00:16:27,431 --> 00:16:31,180
I never got to meet with who always
said no. Pretty much everything.

276
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:34,420
So I'd always have to
justify what our techniques,

277
00:16:34,421 --> 00:16:38,160
we're in the cyber and Intel group and
I finally got a yes, David winded. Sure.

278
00:16:38,170 --> 00:16:41,170
Used to be a criminal.
He's now a defense attorney.

279
00:16:41,171 --> 00:16:44,890
He was a formidable opponent as a
fugitive on the run. Just really,

280
00:16:44,891 --> 00:16:46,930
really smart at what he was doing.

281
00:16:46,931 --> 00:16:51,931
And we had actually recovered his
laptop from the scene at which he fled,

282
00:16:52,960 --> 00:16:56,890
but he had logged out of his account,
didn't have two factor authentication on.

283
00:16:56,890 --> 00:17:01,150
And so we finally got the okay from the
judge to hack into the account and we

284
00:17:01,151 --> 00:17:05,230
knew if we messed up those questions
too many times when we knew we would be

285
00:17:05,231 --> 00:17:10,150
locked out and the judge said we'd be
on our own and those clues were critical

286
00:17:10,151 --> 00:17:15,070
to us. I won't give you a spoiler alert,
but they were critical to the case. Oh,

287
00:17:15,071 --> 00:17:18,220
and by the way, land and who also
works for my company, I joked with him,

288
00:17:18,221 --> 00:17:21,730
he's the only one that throughout the
show would get some titles and it's

289
00:17:21,731 --> 00:17:24,730
because he's from Pittsburgh. So I'm like,
I guess because you speak Pittsburgh,

290
00:17:24,731 --> 00:17:28,420
could they have to do subtitles for
you and not everybody else? All right,

291
00:17:28,421 --> 00:17:29,710
so we'll go to the next video

292
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:36,420
team. I'm going to assign this to Steve,
former naval intelligence officer.

293
00:17:36,421 --> 00:17:41,010
Steve Masterson begins to build a profile
on Troy and Shelly crosscheck public

294
00:17:41,011 --> 00:17:43,800
records. Who are they? What do
they do? We've been married,

295
00:17:43,801 --> 00:17:46,200
their high school sweethearts.
Did they seem to be best friends?

296
00:17:46,201 --> 00:17:47,460
I don't think they're
going to separate it.

297
00:17:47,461 --> 00:17:52,140
I'll tell you obviously can stand hours
together. Yup. Kids, no kids. Okay.

298
00:17:53,050 --> 00:17:55,450
So in this particular one,
again just from a,

299
00:17:55,490 --> 00:17:59,450
and realize the bad guys do this too
to your customers. Right? So they,

300
00:17:59,500 --> 00:18:01,510
we were trying to figure
out Troy and Shelly,

301
00:18:01,511 --> 00:18:04,060
I had the suspicion they
were hiding out in the swamp.

302
00:18:04,061 --> 00:18:06,130
They actually had an airsoft business.

303
00:18:06,430 --> 00:18:09,220
They had done a lot of camping as part
of their air soft business and the

304
00:18:09,221 --> 00:18:12,730
airsoft community was not talking to
us. They literally, and that that's,

305
00:18:12,940 --> 00:18:15,100
that's their friends and family
was the Airsoft community.

306
00:18:15,430 --> 00:18:18,730
So we were trying to figure out from a
social media profile like do they have

307
00:18:18,731 --> 00:18:21,250
kids? Like would the
kids be a clue? No kids.

308
00:18:21,251 --> 00:18:24,130
But we did find out they had a
pet who meant a lot to Shelly.

309
00:18:24,460 --> 00:18:27,720
And so we had a lot of rules of things
we couldn't do to lower people. And,

310
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:31,870
but one of the things I wanted to do
was just have the vet call Shelley's mom

311
00:18:31,871 --> 00:18:35,740
just to check in and to see when Shelley
was going to check in on the pat.

312
00:18:35,750 --> 00:18:39,410
Not to say the pet was sick cause I'm
a pet lover myself or anything. Um,

313
00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:40,750
and at that point I was told,

314
00:18:40,751 --> 00:18:44,290
I know it's not written the rules but
you're really cold person and we're ready

315
00:18:44,291 --> 00:18:46,870
to get into the rules that you
can't talk about pets. So anyways,

316
00:18:46,871 --> 00:18:48,640
pets were taken off the table.
Uh,

317
00:18:48,940 --> 00:18:52,660
but you could see how just
using a social media profile,

318
00:18:52,810 --> 00:18:55,330
we were trying to get a feel
for where they would be.

319
00:18:55,331 --> 00:18:57,940
They had a hundred thousand square
miles they were allowed to hide in.

320
00:18:58,270 --> 00:19:02,030
And just by studying them on Airsoft,
I knew they weren't going to,

321
00:19:02,230 --> 00:19:04,960
they were airsoft.
I'm enthusiastic.

322
00:19:05,010 --> 00:19:09,010
I'm looking at their air soft websites
that they would participate in as well as

323
00:19:09,011 --> 00:19:10,810
the two of them got along so well.

324
00:19:11,080 --> 00:19:13,840
Most likely they weren't going to argue
they were going to be a good support

325
00:19:13,841 --> 00:19:17,170
network for each other.
All right. One more video

326
00:19:18,340 --> 00:19:20,460
I can command center.
The cyber teams.

327
00:19:20,461 --> 00:19:24,370
Facebook wanted poster is widening the
circle of associates for fugitives.

328
00:19:24,371 --> 00:19:28,740
Troy and Shelly guys don't pay attention
to this post. It is not Shelly postings.

329
00:19:28,780 --> 00:19:32,920
Snitches get stitches,
snitches get stitches.

330
00:19:32,950 --> 00:19:35,050
So month to figure out who J D is.

331
00:19:35,590 --> 00:19:39,310
I love the results of what's happening
on this Facebook wanted poster.

332
00:19:39,340 --> 00:19:43,000
We're getting new names and context
we didn't have access to before.

333
00:19:43,030 --> 00:19:44,410
It's incredibly helpful.

334
00:19:46,950 --> 00:19:48,690
So in this particular one,
again,

335
00:19:48,691 --> 00:19:52,080
the community was not talking to us and
so we got permission from the judge to

336
00:19:52,081 --> 00:19:57,081
actually flip their social media profile
to a wanted poster and I knew that they

337
00:19:57,541 --> 00:20:00,990
weren't going to, nobody was going
to turn them in. I knew that,

338
00:20:01,500 --> 00:20:02,940
but what I knew was this,

339
00:20:02,941 --> 00:20:07,941
whoever seemed to defend them the most
was probably somebody I wanted to put

340
00:20:08,131 --> 00:20:12,420
under surveillance. And that
actually ended up helping
us out a lot. In that case,

341
00:20:12,421 --> 00:20:16,320
if somebody who spoke up a lot and told
people not to talk to us and not to help,

342
00:20:16,321 --> 00:20:18,430
we actually went to her house.
Um,

343
00:20:18,510 --> 00:20:23,190
and we are actually ended up in 24 hours
apprehending them with the tips and

344
00:20:23,191 --> 00:20:27,090
nobody outdid them. But it was just
the way people behaved on social media.

345
00:20:27,091 --> 00:20:31,860
It gave us a clue that they might be their
lifeline. And so what does that mean?

346
00:20:31,861 --> 00:20:32,700
So we still have,

347
00:20:32,701 --> 00:20:36,090
not only do we have sort of this new
brave world of social engineering where

348
00:20:36,091 --> 00:20:38,880
it's never been easier
to do for the bad guys,

349
00:20:39,150 --> 00:20:42,510
but we've got these old school breaches
that are coming up in the headlines,

350
00:20:42,511 --> 00:20:46,590
whether it's one or cry pet ya
not pet the SCC Edgar database,

351
00:20:46,930 --> 00:20:50,380
Equifax. And I'm not picking on these
companies. I mean the way I look at it,

352
00:20:50,381 --> 00:20:52,450
is there a victim of a cyber crime?

353
00:20:52,451 --> 00:20:56,440
You may like what they did before and
after and how they handled the breach.

354
00:20:56,441 --> 00:20:59,530
You may agree or disagree,
but they are victims of a crime.

355
00:21:00,580 --> 00:21:03,340
But we've got these new school
problems to deal with now, right?

356
00:21:03,341 --> 00:21:04,870
So we've got misinformation,

357
00:21:04,871 --> 00:21:08,950
we've got the social engineering and
what I call covert crowdsourcing.

358
00:21:09,100 --> 00:21:13,330
So trying to get people into those echo
chambers on the different social media

359
00:21:13,331 --> 00:21:18,331
platforms and trying to incite basically
either positive or negative emotions

360
00:21:18,701 --> 00:21:20,140
around certain topics.

361
00:21:20,560 --> 00:21:24,160
And then we also have this
misplaced faith in technology.

362
00:21:24,490 --> 00:21:28,600
So I don't know how many of you spend
time in security operations center.

363
00:21:28,601 --> 00:21:31,450
I've spent more hours than I care
to and security operations center,

364
00:21:31,451 --> 00:21:32,620
I know Heather as as well.

365
00:21:33,010 --> 00:21:36,990
And so these statistics
are pretty staggering given
the amount of money we have

366
00:21:36,991 --> 00:21:38,800
spent on security technology.

367
00:21:39,070 --> 00:21:44,070
So let's kind of just peel back a little
bit on these 56 56% of all alerts that

368
00:21:45,551 --> 00:21:48,400
go into a security operation
center or investigated,

369
00:21:48,401 --> 00:21:52,540
which means the 44% or not even looked
at it at all because there's just not

370
00:21:52,541 --> 00:21:55,750
enough time and talent to
be able to run those down.

371
00:21:56,110 --> 00:22:00,280
Then of those 56% alerts
that were actually looked at,

372
00:22:00,940 --> 00:22:04,030
only 28% are deemed legitimate.

373
00:22:04,031 --> 00:22:06,910
So the rest are just noise.

374
00:22:07,420 --> 00:22:10,990
72% are just noise.

375
00:22:11,620 --> 00:22:14,500
And then out of that smaller subset now,

376
00:22:14,501 --> 00:22:19,501
so remember we went from 56% to 28%
so out of that 28% only 46% of those

377
00:22:22,180 --> 00:22:24,550
actually get remediated.

378
00:22:25,030 --> 00:22:29,890
Do we wonder why we have
the data breaches? We do.

379
00:22:29,891 --> 00:22:32,860
Do we wonder why our infrastructure,

380
00:22:33,280 --> 00:22:37,180
our cybersecurity resiliency
for companies is at risk?

381
00:22:37,660 --> 00:22:42,660
Do we wonder why it's time to start naming
the human as any something else other

382
00:22:43,391 --> 00:22:48,391
than they're the weakest link we have
to change how we focus on this case in

383
00:22:49,781 --> 00:22:50,141
point.

384
00:22:50,141 --> 00:22:55,141
The elections that better had been our
tsunami warning and I feel like a lot of

385
00:22:55,211 --> 00:22:59,050
times the data breaches that we have,
we get excited about it.

386
00:22:59,051 --> 00:23:03,040
Sort of like waking up really early in
the morning to go do something and then

387
00:23:03,041 --> 00:23:05,800
somebody hits the snooze alarm
and it goes back to sleep.

388
00:23:06,370 --> 00:23:10,930
We're all out of snooze alarms and
if Equifax it and do it for you.

389
00:23:11,140 --> 00:23:14,770
The early warning signs that tsunami
bell going off with the elections

390
00:23:14,800 --> 00:23:18,400
absolutely should because it's not
just in America, it's in other places.

391
00:23:18,760 --> 00:23:21,820
So let's talk about kind of my point of
view on how I look at this and I welcome

392
00:23:21,821 --> 00:23:25,600
any questions, comments on this
during the Q and a portion.

393
00:23:26,080 --> 00:23:29,260
So I look at this and kind of three
components and the first one being is the

394
00:23:29,261 --> 00:23:31,120
voter registration databases.

395
00:23:31,630 --> 00:23:34,990
We know for a fact that those
were targeted by hackers.

396
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:37,480
We know that Chicago,
not Chicago,

397
00:23:37,481 --> 00:23:42,481
the state of Illinois had to take their
voter registration database offline for

398
00:23:42,881 --> 00:23:46,670
weeks during the summer leading
up to presidential election cycle.

399
00:23:47,780 --> 00:23:51,590
They had had an incident and they felt
the best thing to do was to take it

400
00:23:51,591 --> 00:23:54,890
offline to remediate the
incident before they came online.

401
00:23:55,250 --> 00:23:59,060
Did that impact anybody's ability to vote?
I don't know if it did or not,

402
00:23:59,660 --> 00:24:02,900
but I know during those weeks getting
a voter registration and if you were

403
00:24:02,901 --> 00:24:06,920
somebody new to Illinois was not
hasty to do while that was down.

404
00:24:07,370 --> 00:24:09,590
So you have the voter
registration databases,

405
00:24:09,830 --> 00:24:14,120
you also have the polling
booths themselves. Now,

406
00:24:14,121 --> 00:24:17,840
nobody has said that they have found
evidence of somebody went in and voted for

407
00:24:17,841 --> 00:24:21,380
one person and on the back end a
different person was voted for.

408
00:24:21,380 --> 00:24:22,640
Nobody has said that yet,

409
00:24:23,240 --> 00:24:26,480
but ethical hackers at
black hat this year said,

410
00:24:26,690 --> 00:24:29,540
if I have proximity and I have time,

411
00:24:29,780 --> 00:24:33,650
I can absolutely do just that
and you may or may not know this,

412
00:24:33,651 --> 00:24:35,180
but at the state level,
not,

413
00:24:35,230 --> 00:24:37,910
not only does every state get a
chance to do this differently,

414
00:24:38,450 --> 00:24:43,280
the counties and precincts within those
states may also do it differently and up

415
00:24:43,281 --> 00:24:44,600
until this election cycle,

416
00:24:44,601 --> 00:24:49,601
there was a race to go to
to the electronic only with
no paper trail for audit.

417
00:24:51,110 --> 00:24:53,330
I don't know about you. I think
that sounds like a really bad idea.

418
00:24:53,331 --> 00:24:57,290
I think we need a trust but verify
process here and really smart people are

419
00:24:57,291 --> 00:25:00,980
working on this problem to make sure
from a voter registration database

420
00:25:00,981 --> 00:25:03,260
perspective,
our data is more secure,

421
00:25:03,560 --> 00:25:05,600
but this has to be solved
at the state level.

422
00:25:06,380 --> 00:25:10,700
Lots of really smart people are working
on the actual polling booths themselves

423
00:25:10,730 --> 00:25:15,680
and making sure that we don't allow
proximity and we don't allow time because

424
00:25:15,681 --> 00:25:17,780
somebody with motive could do that.

425
00:25:18,290 --> 00:25:22,460
And then the third piece is what I
talked about, which is our new domain.

426
00:25:22,461 --> 00:25:24,020
We need to be worrying about insecurity,

427
00:25:24,021 --> 00:25:28,580
which is the whole social media and
our inner connectedness on the internet

428
00:25:28,581 --> 00:25:30,800
domain that needs to be
thought about differently.

429
00:25:31,010 --> 00:25:34,130
And I'm just going to show you a couple
of quick headlines that have been in the

430
00:25:34,131 --> 00:25:37,340
news recently. So and it,
and it's every company.

431
00:25:37,580 --> 00:25:39,710
There is no one company at fault here,

432
00:25:40,010 --> 00:25:44,870
but this better be our wake up call for
how we think about what happened during

433
00:25:44,871 --> 00:25:47,180
the selection cycle.
Now don't get me wrong,

434
00:25:47,181 --> 00:25:52,181
political espionage has been around since
they were two human beings on earth.

435
00:25:52,430 --> 00:25:54,200
Okay?
So that's recorded history.

436
00:25:54,530 --> 00:25:58,610
We know that propaganda has
been around for all of mankind.

437
00:25:59,540 --> 00:26:02,540
But what happened,
this particular cycle,

438
00:26:02,570 --> 00:26:05,090
both overseas and here in America,

439
00:26:05,570 --> 00:26:10,570
was being able to produce
propaganda to push propaganda,

440
00:26:10,910 --> 00:26:15,910
leverage these social media platforms
that have been designed to serve me and to

441
00:26:16,461 --> 00:26:19,340
give me things that help me and assist me,

442
00:26:19,341 --> 00:26:23,750
which means they know my likes and
preferences and because they do that,

443
00:26:23,780 --> 00:26:28,760
the social media platforms were taken
advantage of and they were able to at a

444
00:26:28,761 --> 00:26:29,391
speed,

445
00:26:29,391 --> 00:26:34,391
never seen before in the history
of pushing political propaganda.

446
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:38,660
Not only push it out that to be able to
see in real time whether or not they had

447
00:26:38,661 --> 00:26:42,740
an impact on you and me based on likes,
based on shares,

448
00:26:43,050 --> 00:26:45,480
based on posts.
They never had that before.

449
00:26:45,481 --> 00:26:47,010
They didn't know if it was working or not.

450
00:26:47,220 --> 00:26:50,460
They to put boots on the ground and
they had to see whether or not they're

451
00:26:50,461 --> 00:26:52,200
grassroots campaign was working.

452
00:26:52,860 --> 00:26:57,060
So we have never seen what was done at
the speed and scale in which it was done,

453
00:26:57,061 --> 00:27:00,600
not only to us but the
elections going on overseas.

454
00:27:01,320 --> 00:27:03,300
And Google has recently
come forward and said,

455
00:27:03,301 --> 00:27:07,260
you've done your own research and
you are taking this very seriously.

456
00:27:08,040 --> 00:27:09,390
There's actually a proposed law,

457
00:27:09,391 --> 00:27:14,010
and I always say be careful about new
proposed laws because they typically are

458
00:27:14,940 --> 00:27:18,120
not going to stop bad things
from happening and in some
cases they're going to

459
00:27:18,121 --> 00:27:23,100
create a situation that's so expensive
for you to comply with that it kind of

460
00:27:23,101 --> 00:27:27,270
loses the spirit in which it was men.
But there's a law around sort of the,

461
00:27:27,271 --> 00:27:27,690
you know,

462
00:27:27,690 --> 00:27:32,640
the safety of ads in the political cycle
act that's being looked at on the hill

463
00:27:32,641 --> 00:27:36,450
right now.
Let's bring it back to the humans though.

464
00:27:36,660 --> 00:27:40,980
So if you remember wanna cry,
which was really bad,

465
00:27:40,981 --> 00:27:44,850
especially for the UK, I was actually
in London, the day one a cry hit.

466
00:27:46,080 --> 00:27:51,080
And what struck me was this was different
because typically ransomware is all

467
00:27:51,961 --> 00:27:56,961
about how much bitcoin can I get out of
the victim and how much have it can I

468
00:27:57,361 --> 00:28:00,690
wreak on them. In the
meantime, this was different.

469
00:28:01,440 --> 00:28:05,340
People showed up for
surgery and more told,

470
00:28:05,460 --> 00:28:09,720
I can't operate on you today because
we're under a ransomware attack.

471
00:28:09,960 --> 00:28:14,960
People showed up sick and needing
prescriptions and they were told,

472
00:28:15,090 --> 00:28:19,680
we can't write you a prescription today.
That to me is that,

473
00:28:19,681 --> 00:28:23,370
that's where, this is not about how much
bitcoin did these guys get away with.

474
00:28:23,820 --> 00:28:28,650
But at this point,
I think human safety trumps security.

475
00:28:29,610 --> 00:28:33,870
And this is where we have to be
thinking about design a lot differently.

476
00:28:34,290 --> 00:28:36,990
And so for my Monte Python fans,
um,

477
00:28:37,020 --> 00:28:39,480
this is where I'm throwing the holy
hand grenade because we've been doing

478
00:28:39,481 --> 00:28:42,990
security wrong and we need to
fix how we're focusing on this.

479
00:28:43,470 --> 00:28:46,290
So what are some lessons learned? Um,
and I don't know if you know this,

480
00:28:46,291 --> 00:28:48,930
this is actually a picture of the White
House flower shop, isn't it beautiful?

481
00:28:48,931 --> 00:28:52,800
So after all that dark talk,
it's time for a zen moment.

482
00:28:53,130 --> 00:28:55,830
And this is the beautiful White
House flower shops. So if you,

483
00:28:55,950 --> 00:28:57,870
any Downton Abbey fans,
uh,

484
00:28:57,871 --> 00:29:02,190
it's very much like that sort of the
ushers office underneath the White House

485
00:29:02,191 --> 00:29:07,050
that keeps that sense of history
and protocol and class and elegance.

486
00:29:07,051 --> 00:29:10,710
And I remember when I went into the
White House and I did my walkabouts.

487
00:29:10,711 --> 00:29:13,920
So there's 13 components that make up
the executive office of the president.

488
00:29:14,280 --> 00:29:17,730
And I went into the White House
flower shop in is just so beautiful.

489
00:29:17,940 --> 00:29:20,910
And I noticed that as she was
making these flower arrangements,

490
00:29:21,090 --> 00:29:26,090
they had bar codes on every single flower
and she would scan the flour with the

491
00:29:26,311 --> 00:29:29,940
Barcode. She would cut it off and putting
the flower arrangement. And I thought,

492
00:29:29,941 --> 00:29:32,640
well that's interesting.
Not really sure what that's all about.

493
00:29:32,910 --> 00:29:35,580
So I go into the kitchen and they're
getting ready to make a big dinner.

494
00:29:35,610 --> 00:29:39,120
And I noticed that the chicken breasts
and the pork chops and the paper towels,

495
00:29:39,360 --> 00:29:43,000
they're all barcoded. And before
they get used, they're scanned,

496
00:29:43,360 --> 00:29:47,320
barcodes are removed and they move on
with what they're doing. I'm like, okay,

497
00:29:47,620 --> 00:29:50,410
I've read a lot of Brad Thor
novels and Vince Flynn novels.

498
00:29:50,411 --> 00:29:51,940
I think I know what's going on here.

499
00:29:52,090 --> 00:29:54,910
It's like to make sure there's no
anthrax poisoning and everything. Right.

500
00:29:54,911 --> 00:29:57,460
So it's not like with love from
Russia or something like that.

501
00:29:57,730 --> 00:29:59,980
So I go up to somebody and
the ushers office and I said,

502
00:29:59,981 --> 00:30:02,830
what's going on here with the
barcodes? I think I know. And he says,

503
00:30:02,831 --> 00:30:05,740
what do you think it is? And I said, it's,
you know, make sure it's not poisoned.

504
00:30:06,250 --> 00:30:10,630
And he said, no, it definitely
helps with that, but that's
not why. And I said, okay,

505
00:30:10,660 --> 00:30:13,030
well I know like if Queen Mum,
we're here,

506
00:30:13,031 --> 00:30:15,970
you wouldn't want to run out of pork
chops. Right? That'd be embarrassing.

507
00:30:15,971 --> 00:30:19,030
He can't run to the closest
grocery store and get pork chops.

508
00:30:19,390 --> 00:30:22,750
So that's what it is. It's to make
sure from a supply chain standpoint.

509
00:30:23,110 --> 00:30:27,040
And he said, well, it helps with that,
but that's not the reason why. And I said,

510
00:30:27,041 --> 00:30:28,720
well, what is it? And he said, well,

511
00:30:29,020 --> 00:30:33,490
it has to do with appropriations because
you see who's ever going to eat that

512
00:30:33,491 --> 00:30:38,380
pork chop if it's a political dinner
versus an international head of state

513
00:30:38,381 --> 00:30:38,801
visiting,

514
00:30:38,801 --> 00:30:42,280
it's a different bucket of money and we
have to charge it to the right bucket of

515
00:30:42,281 --> 00:30:42,730
money and hey,

516
00:30:42,730 --> 00:30:46,000
this is your tax dollars at work for
those of you who are Americans here. Okay,

517
00:30:46,240 --> 00:30:50,680
not making this up. And so they had to
scan it against the buckets of money.

518
00:30:50,681 --> 00:30:52,780
So whoever was enjoying
the flower arrangement,

519
00:30:52,781 --> 00:30:57,160
we had to make sure the right bucket
of money went to pay for those flowers.

520
00:30:57,790 --> 00:31:00,850
Now I ask you, so we were doing the
right thing there, but I asked you,

521
00:31:00,851 --> 00:31:05,851
when you think about the humans and the
humans involved in this and you think

522
00:31:06,491 --> 00:31:09,550
about the data and all
data is not created equal.

523
00:31:10,240 --> 00:31:15,070
So if you think about protecting data
and putting stricter standards on some,

524
00:31:15,430 --> 00:31:17,170
an easier standards on other,

525
00:31:17,530 --> 00:31:21,340
when you compare the number of chicken
breasts and baby's breath scan that day

526
00:31:21,341 --> 00:31:23,650
versus the president's schedule,
which has everyone,

527
00:31:23,651 --> 00:31:28,050
he's meeting with the secret service
agents down to the second where he's going

528
00:31:28,051 --> 00:31:30,580
to turn a corner,
which one's more valuable

529
00:31:32,230 --> 00:31:33,100
president's schedule.

530
00:31:34,480 --> 00:31:37,930
The other thing I want you to be thinking
about too is that in my walkabouts,

531
00:31:38,620 --> 00:31:41,590
I went and met with one of the other
components and one of these components

532
00:31:41,591 --> 00:31:44,920
traveled with the president a lot and
most of what they did was not on the

533
00:31:44,921 --> 00:31:46,150
classified systems,

534
00:31:46,151 --> 00:31:50,350
but we had a rule that more than two
pieces of unclassified data basically

535
00:31:50,351 --> 00:31:53,320
created a classified situation.
You know, just very sensitive.

536
00:31:53,321 --> 00:31:55,690
Everything at the White House
is very sensitive information.

537
00:31:56,350 --> 00:31:59,950
And so as a meeting with them, I said
to them, I was just asking everybody,

538
00:31:59,951 --> 00:32:03,670
is there anything we do that's not
working for you? And so I asked them,

539
00:32:03,940 --> 00:32:06,400
I know you're under a lot of tight
deadlines when you're on the road with the

540
00:32:06,401 --> 00:32:07,210
president,

541
00:32:07,210 --> 00:32:10,870
is there anything we ask you to do in
the name of security or in the name of

542
00:32:10,871 --> 00:32:15,130
logistics that makes it hard for you
to do your job? And they said sure.

543
00:32:15,190 --> 00:32:17,710
And I said, well what do you do because
you have these really tight deadlines.

544
00:32:17,711 --> 00:32:19,000
And they said,
oh it's really simple.

545
00:32:19,240 --> 00:32:23,050
We either take a picture of it or we
print screen it and we take it with us to

546
00:32:23,051 --> 00:32:24,010
foreign countries.

547
00:32:24,550 --> 00:32:29,140
And to which I kind of like had that
moment like that pit in your stomach

548
00:32:29,141 --> 00:32:33,730
moment. And the old me from
financial services who was all about,

549
00:32:33,731 --> 00:32:38,260
it's about training and it's just about
explaining to you wanting to come back

550
00:32:38,261 --> 00:32:42,320
to the top. But the new me who said, I'm
not going to blame the human anymore,

551
00:32:42,350 --> 00:32:45,290
I'm not going to say the human is the
weakest link. I'm going to say I am.

552
00:32:45,650 --> 00:32:49,490
These are my designs. Okay, this
is our team doing the development.

553
00:32:49,730 --> 00:32:50,780
I own this.

554
00:32:51,650 --> 00:32:55,100
And so the new me listened
and the new me said,

555
00:32:55,101 --> 00:32:59,630
why don't we get together and why
don't you show us what's going on here?

556
00:32:59,690 --> 00:33:04,310
Because I realized I lost sight of
data because I had a bad design.

557
00:33:05,240 --> 00:33:10,240
And so I want to push back on you a
little bit of always be thinking it's not

558
00:33:10,821 --> 00:33:15,170
just feature and functionality from
the user experience. Never lose that.

559
00:33:15,870 --> 00:33:17,780
Always have that at
the front of your mind.

560
00:33:18,410 --> 00:33:23,410
But I need to push back and I need to
say the weakest link is actually in

561
00:33:23,811 --> 00:33:26,900
development. We need to stop
relying on the human for this.

562
00:33:26,901 --> 00:33:28,580
It's failing us every single time.

563
00:33:29,330 --> 00:33:32,270
And then the last thing that I've
learned is you really need a kill switch.

564
00:33:32,990 --> 00:33:36,050
And so Barbie, I dunno how many
of you know about talking Barbie,

565
00:33:36,410 --> 00:33:40,400
but a Barbie when she first came out,
all her, most of these issues are fixed.

566
00:33:40,401 --> 00:33:42,170
I'm going to talk to you about.
But when she first came out,

567
00:33:42,380 --> 00:33:46,640
she computer viruses and she
also talked to any wifi network,

568
00:33:46,641 --> 00:33:49,940
not just your home network but
any that said Barbie in it,

569
00:33:49,970 --> 00:33:53,560
like wicked Barbie Evil Barbie,
like networks you shouldn't talk to.

570
00:33:54,080 --> 00:33:55,430
And I was having one of those moments.

571
00:33:55,431 --> 00:33:58,190
I was in the kitchen and I heard my
little girl may have say to her older

572
00:33:58,191 --> 00:34:02,150
brothers, I think I'm going to ask Mama
for a talking Barbie for my birthday.

573
00:34:02,780 --> 00:34:07,190
And so my middle one says, well how
does she work? Mave and she says, well,

574
00:34:07,191 --> 00:34:10,010
according to the commercial,
I will talk to her,

575
00:34:10,011 --> 00:34:14,150
she will listen to me and she'll actually
answer me back like in real time,

576
00:34:14,151 --> 00:34:17,840
like no pause. She'll answer me
back. And my oldest one says,

577
00:34:18,170 --> 00:34:21,020
I don't think mom was going to let you
have that because I'm assuming she's

578
00:34:21,021 --> 00:34:24,710
probably talking to the cloud. You're
probably talking to someone in the cloud.

579
00:34:25,190 --> 00:34:26,490
And My middle one says yen,

580
00:34:26,510 --> 00:34:29,660
some Rando and so if you don't
have millennials in your life,

581
00:34:29,840 --> 00:34:32,470
you know what Aramco is, right?
It's a random people rent.

582
00:34:32,570 --> 00:34:36,680
So some random Joe who's going to help
the artificial intelligence interpret

583
00:34:36,681 --> 00:34:40,040
everything you said to give you a
good answer back. And she said, yeah,

584
00:34:40,041 --> 00:34:42,800
you're probably right. I'm going to
ask her an easy bake oven instead.

585
00:34:43,220 --> 00:34:47,270
But my point in bringing up talking
Barbie is with when she had those computer

586
00:34:47,271 --> 00:34:49,170
viruses,
when she was talking to Wifi network,

587
00:34:49,171 --> 00:34:52,190
she shouldn't be talking to because you
don't know if they're trusted or not.

588
00:34:52,490 --> 00:34:55,880
You could turn off her Internet
connection and still play with Barbie.

589
00:34:57,050 --> 00:35:01,220
Just like I remember reading when the
nest had a software glitch and it wasn't

590
00:35:01,490 --> 00:35:05,030
charging the battery. And so people on
the local news where like, oh my gosh,

591
00:35:05,031 --> 00:35:06,710
it's getting cold.
What am I going to do?

592
00:35:06,950 --> 00:35:09,170
My nest thermostats not
working and I'm thinking,

593
00:35:09,410 --> 00:35:12,650
you do know you can walk to the
furnace and flip it on, right?

594
00:35:12,680 --> 00:35:15,260
You do know that like the
thermostats just to help with thing.

595
00:35:15,500 --> 00:35:19,490
And so that kill switch to
me is so vitally important
with what's going on today.

596
00:35:19,491 --> 00:35:23,270
If you think about the incidents
like wanna cry or Equifax,

597
00:35:23,570 --> 00:35:27,380
and the other piece you need to be asking
yourself though is when do I flip a

598
00:35:27,381 --> 00:35:29,330
kill switch?
Right?

599
00:35:29,331 --> 00:35:33,230
So when do I flip it with limited
functionality will be left.

600
00:35:33,620 --> 00:35:35,750
What are the rules of engagement for this,

601
00:35:36,410 --> 00:35:39,870
this kill switch and how do I
educate people to know it's there?

602
00:35:40,470 --> 00:35:44,010
So the next time if somebody says,
look, there's an internet of things,

603
00:35:44,011 --> 00:35:48,060
botnet rights, we were talking about
reaper last week or whatever it is,

604
00:35:48,270 --> 00:35:52,020
that you have an easy seamless
way with your customers,

605
00:35:52,021 --> 00:35:56,130
whether they're your business
customers or your consumer customers to

606
00:35:56,131 --> 00:35:59,220
communicate with them,
everything's going to be okay.

607
00:35:59,670 --> 00:36:01,440
Here's the kill switch in case it's not.

608
00:36:03,810 --> 00:36:07,770
So if you admit all securities
defeatable if you think about sort of the

609
00:36:07,771 --> 00:36:11,760
adversarial targeting like we did on
hunted, because the bad guys do this too.

610
00:36:12,090 --> 00:36:15,390
If you have this aggressive offensive
and you're thinking ahead about how do I

611
00:36:15,391 --> 00:36:17,520
have a kill switch,
how do I design for you?

612
00:36:17,521 --> 00:36:20,640
So you're not having to worry
about this and plan ahead,

613
00:36:20,641 --> 00:36:22,080
you're going to be so much better off.

614
00:36:22,590 --> 00:36:25,980
So I want to leave you with some
new rules. And the first one is,

615
00:36:25,981 --> 00:36:28,110
you probably have never heard
a security person say this,

616
00:36:28,111 --> 00:36:33,060
but I want you to think
about your development where
you're putting a warm hug

617
00:36:33,061 --> 00:36:35,790
around the user for
security, right? So we're,

618
00:36:35,970 --> 00:36:38,070
it's almost like they don't
even have to think about it.

619
00:36:38,160 --> 00:36:41,150
That's my timer to get
into our Q and a here.

620
00:36:42,420 --> 00:36:46,290
New Domains to protect. So it's not just
the data, the devices, the hardware,

621
00:36:46,291 --> 00:36:47,101
the software,

622
00:36:47,101 --> 00:36:51,810
it's also social media and then the fact
that there is no perimeter to secure.

623
00:36:52,860 --> 00:36:56,280
Uh, also for those of you
who are interested in, um,

624
00:36:56,281 --> 00:36:58,080
kind of diversity in stem,

625
00:36:58,320 --> 00:37:01,980
we do have a linkedin conversation called
help us sister up if you're interested

626
00:37:01,981 --> 00:37:05,160
in it. It's just up there a few if
you want to reach out to us that way.

627
00:37:05,580 --> 00:37:09,110
And there's my contact information
with that. Let's go to our Q and a

628
00:37:09,170 --> 00:37:12,230
session. Create. So for
those of you in the audience,

629
00:37:12,231 --> 00:37:15,620
do you think of your questions, but we're
going to take a dory question first.

630
00:37:16,070 --> 00:37:17,150
And that question is,

631
00:37:17,510 --> 00:37:21,470
could you tell us more about how you
became interested in this kind of work in

632
00:37:21,471 --> 00:37:22,700
your journey into the field

633
00:37:23,730 --> 00:37:27,060
or, um, and this is something Sarah
and I were talking about a little bit,

634
00:37:27,061 --> 00:37:31,740
which I say I'm very blessed that
security actually came and found me. Uh,

635
00:37:31,840 --> 00:37:35,760
when I first came out of graduate
school at University of Virginia,

636
00:37:36,060 --> 00:37:40,080
my vision was I was going to
work on cutting edge technology,

637
00:37:40,320 --> 00:37:44,070
innovative things that hadn't been dreamed
of yet and that's what I was going to

638
00:37:44,071 --> 00:37:48,930
do. And uh, then I married somebody who
was in the navy and we got stationed in

639
00:37:48,931 --> 00:37:49,980
Jacksonville,
Florida.

640
00:37:50,040 --> 00:37:54,450
And I went to work in banking
and I actually got to be a,

641
00:37:54,451 --> 00:37:58,740
I got hired into a group. They kind of
made a role around me and I was able to,

642
00:37:59,070 --> 00:38:02,100
in addition to my day
duties as a programmer,

643
00:38:02,150 --> 00:38:07,150
I'm in trouble support and helping people
with kind of their end user computing.

644
00:38:07,381 --> 00:38:10,230
I was allowed to work on
innovative technologies.

645
00:38:10,230 --> 00:38:14,460
And in doing that for anybody who's
worked with a financial services industry,

646
00:38:14,461 --> 00:38:17,400
when you're on the leading edge of
technology are on the leading edge of

647
00:38:17,500 --> 00:38:21,090
cybercrime and money
launderers and terrorists.

648
00:38:21,600 --> 00:38:25,650
And that's really what got me kind
of passionate and fired up around

649
00:38:25,651 --> 00:38:26,500
cybersecurity.

650
00:38:26,520 --> 00:38:30,750
But at the same time creating it in
such a way that you still love doing

651
00:38:30,751 --> 00:38:31,830
business with the bank,

652
00:38:31,860 --> 00:38:35,770
but that we were fighting on your behalf
to keep the fraudsters of your account.

653
00:38:36,190 --> 00:38:38,490
And it really just cemented for me.
Um,

654
00:38:38,530 --> 00:38:43,530
when I got the opportunity to work
at the White House and the briefings,

655
00:38:43,601 --> 00:38:44,980
you know,
the classified briefings,

656
00:38:44,981 --> 00:38:49,981
you walk into that thinking you've kind
of seen it all in financial services and

657
00:38:50,110 --> 00:38:53,710
you walk into these briefings and
realized I was looking into a keyhole in a

658
00:38:53,711 --> 00:38:58,711
tiny room and I had no real idea about
the capabilities of the adversary.

659
00:38:59,501 --> 00:39:03,280
And so that's when I made my commitment
that however many years I had left on

660
00:39:03,281 --> 00:39:04,120
this earth to work,

661
00:39:04,121 --> 00:39:08,200
that I would use it to fiercely defends
people and companies and the government

662
00:39:08,201 --> 00:39:10,300
and our allies from bad people.

663
00:39:12,330 --> 00:39:13,163
Yeah.

664
00:39:13,340 --> 00:39:14,380
Hey,
um,

665
00:39:14,750 --> 00:39:18,350
and you get a book for asking the first
you can ask and I already get that.

666
00:39:18,620 --> 00:39:20,600
This is an exciting thank you.

667
00:39:20,601 --> 00:39:24,290
So the question actually relates
directly to the title of your book. Um,

668
00:39:24,320 --> 00:39:26,870
I'm on the federated
identity team here at Google.

669
00:39:26,880 --> 00:39:31,750
So I think a lot about people's identities
on the Internet and something your

670
00:39:32,810 --> 00:39:37,810
demo tape made me think about was that
a lot of the ways that when people

671
00:39:37,911 --> 00:39:39,950
strengthened their internet identity,

672
00:39:39,980 --> 00:39:41,570
like when we think of the
early days of the Internet,

673
00:39:41,571 --> 00:39:45,980
people had very anonymous identities.
Um, and now more and more,

674
00:39:45,981 --> 00:39:47,390
especially with Google products,

675
00:39:47,420 --> 00:39:50,740
we are giving you a stronger and
stronger presence online. Um,

676
00:39:51,140 --> 00:39:54,470
and on the product side we think of a
lot of ways that that can be helpful for

677
00:39:54,471 --> 00:39:58,670
you. And then this video reminded
me that two people, uh, ed,

678
00:39:58,671 --> 00:39:59,870
particularly law enforcement,

679
00:39:59,871 --> 00:40:02,750
there are a lot of ways that having a
stronger identity is really great for

680
00:40:03,110 --> 00:40:08,110
being tracked or censored or any of
these other really bad security related

681
00:40:08,600 --> 00:40:09,061
issues.

682
00:40:09,061 --> 00:40:14,061
So I was wondering if you had any ideas
for addressing that or any examples that

683
00:40:16,791 --> 00:40:19,820
you've seen in your career where
having a stronger internet identity can

684
00:40:19,821 --> 00:40:22,910
actually make you safer
from something malicious?

685
00:40:22,940 --> 00:40:26,650
Maybe not a valid police
investigation, but a, uh,

686
00:40:26,840 --> 00:40:28,450
not so valid police investigation.

687
00:40:28,690 --> 00:40:32,020
Yeah. We, I think, uh,
well for example, we have,

688
00:40:32,080 --> 00:40:37,080
we have had situations with
mistaken identity where
because of that kind of lack

689
00:40:37,511 --> 00:40:39,340
of clarity around identity,

690
00:40:39,341 --> 00:40:43,390
you've had people wrongly accused and
handling nuclear, their name, you know,

691
00:40:43,391 --> 00:40:45,850
police knocking at their door and
they're like on, it really wasn't me.

692
00:40:45,851 --> 00:40:49,900
You've got the wrong person.
And so I do think you're creating,

693
00:40:50,530 --> 00:40:51,341
what I would say is,

694
00:40:51,341 --> 00:40:55,630
and I think there's a lot in the product
development that Google's doing right

695
00:40:55,631 --> 00:41:00,550
on this, which is you're informing
people on what to opt in and opt out on,

696
00:41:00,610 --> 00:41:02,590
on kind of the identity management.

697
00:41:02,980 --> 00:41:06,820
And I think it can be a really good thing.
At the same time,

698
00:41:06,850 --> 00:41:09,770
it does create a little bit of,
um,

699
00:41:10,030 --> 00:41:14,350
I'm in a conundrum about it myself
because when I think about especially the

700
00:41:14,351 --> 00:41:15,730
generation coming up,

701
00:41:16,480 --> 00:41:21,480
they're questioning and learning and
they're treating it all as a conversation

702
00:41:22,030 --> 00:41:26,140
online and there's a
generation ahead of them,

703
00:41:26,200 --> 00:41:30,010
maybe multiple generations ahead
of them that once it's written,

704
00:41:30,610 --> 00:41:35,610
it's now almost like that's a fact about
you versus a conversation around the

705
00:41:36,441 --> 00:41:37,310
dinner table.

706
00:41:37,700 --> 00:41:42,700
And so I worry for people who want to
leverage the Internet to reach out to

707
00:41:43,671 --> 00:41:45,320
other people who don't think like them,

708
00:41:45,321 --> 00:41:50,321
to challenge their own intellectual
thought process on different topics that

709
00:41:50,991 --> 00:41:54,560
it's going to be held against them. And,
and that's unfortunate. And so that,

710
00:41:54,590 --> 00:41:57,020
I think,
to me that's the conundrum I'm in,

711
00:41:57,021 --> 00:42:01,820
which is I would like to see stronger
identity online. I'd like to see,

712
00:42:01,850 --> 00:42:02,451
um,
you know,

713
00:42:02,451 --> 00:42:06,980
better kind of identity access management
for more security and privacy based on

714
00:42:06,981 --> 00:42:08,240
opting in and opting out.

715
00:42:08,600 --> 00:42:12,320
But at the same time I'm hesitant
because I'm worried that,

716
00:42:12,321 --> 00:42:15,680
and kind of having that
identity that follows you,

717
00:42:16,040 --> 00:42:19,400
you don't get to choose what
people see and don't see. And,

718
00:42:19,401 --> 00:42:21,010
and that's a conundrum for me and I,

719
00:42:21,011 --> 00:42:24,980
I don't actually have a good answer for
you on that except for keep pushing,

720
00:42:25,280 --> 00:42:30,020
keep pushing and your product design
and the developers around what are the

721
00:42:30,021 --> 00:42:32,690
longterm impacts on people, um, for the,

722
00:42:32,750 --> 00:42:36,770
for things potentially following their
identity. Can you get a new identity?

723
00:42:36,800 --> 00:42:40,490
Can you decide like,
I've grown up now and that's not me.

724
00:42:40,491 --> 00:42:41,960
And can you leave that behind?

725
00:42:42,290 --> 00:42:46,900
And for many of us who are digital
immigrants and not digital natives. Yeah,

726
00:42:46,910 --> 00:42:49,880
I'd like to think I'm a digital native,
but technically based on birth year,

727
00:42:49,881 --> 00:42:53,090
I'm not a, but you know, I
started programming in school.

728
00:42:53,091 --> 00:42:57,020
So for me I think that way. But when
you think about true digital natives,

729
00:42:57,021 --> 00:43:00,440
there's no on and off the web.

730
00:43:01,460 --> 00:43:06,200
And so for them that, that's what I
worry about. Great question. Awesome.

731
00:43:06,201 --> 00:43:07,034
Thank you.

732
00:43:08,200 --> 00:43:10,690
Great. And our next question
is what do you think the,

733
00:43:10,750 --> 00:43:13,750
or what do you see as the biggest
challenge right now with the Internet of

734
00:43:13,751 --> 00:43:14,584
things?

735
00:43:14,940 --> 00:43:15,960
Uh,
um,

736
00:43:16,170 --> 00:43:21,170
you know what's interesting
on the Internet of things
I've noticed there tends

737
00:43:21,691 --> 00:43:22,980
to be in the security industry,

738
00:43:22,981 --> 00:43:27,100
they're so focused on we need to make
sure that that device itself that's going

739
00:43:27,101 --> 00:43:28,920
to be secure.
And that's the problem.

740
00:43:29,550 --> 00:43:33,870
And I am actually pushing back on
that and saying, if you think about,

741
00:43:33,871 --> 00:43:35,310
I had a picture in the presentation,

742
00:43:35,311 --> 00:43:39,090
the Tacoma Narrows Bridge for the
1940s the Tacoma narrows bridge,

743
00:43:39,091 --> 00:43:42,840
if you look it up, it was built out
of concrete and steel independently,

744
00:43:42,841 --> 00:43:45,210
very strong materials.

745
00:43:46,170 --> 00:43:50,580
We didn't think about the
enterprise architecture
enough and it literally looked

746
00:43:50,581 --> 00:43:53,550
like a piece of taffy pulling. Thankfully
nobody lost their lives that day,

747
00:43:53,551 --> 00:43:57,420
but the bridge collapsed under I
think 40 mile an hour wind shears.

748
00:43:58,680 --> 00:44:00,210
And so the Internet of things,
to me,

749
00:44:00,211 --> 00:44:05,211
I think that the biggest concern for me
is we're so focused on how do I get that

750
00:44:05,641 --> 00:44:06,660
component secure.

751
00:44:06,660 --> 00:44:10,560
We're not actually thinking about how
has that component part of a bigger

752
00:44:10,561 --> 00:44:15,561
enterprise architecture and how do we
know when that component is behaving badly

753
00:44:16,771 --> 00:44:19,740
either because of bad guy took it over
or there's something wrong with it.

754
00:44:20,340 --> 00:44:25,340
And how do we know when that technology
is obsolete and because it's so embedded

755
00:44:25,831 --> 00:44:29,160
in what we're doing, we don't even know
it's there. So kind of another story.

756
00:44:29,161 --> 00:44:30,240
It's not internet of things,

757
00:44:30,241 --> 00:44:35,241
but there a house where the phone started
dialing a random number several times

758
00:44:38,791 --> 00:44:43,791
a day for six weeks and nobody could
figure out why the phone was doing that.

759
00:44:44,970 --> 00:44:49,230
And what they realized was,
is the previous owners had announced,

760
00:44:49,260 --> 00:44:53,760
not used oil tank and technology
had been fitted on the oil tank,

761
00:44:53,761 --> 00:44:57,480
that when it went under a
certain level of being full,

762
00:44:57,810 --> 00:44:59,940
it would automatically
dial the oil company,

763
00:44:59,941 --> 00:45:04,230
which is now no longer in business
owners changed hands on the house.

764
00:45:04,530 --> 00:45:06,210
So when the new owners come in,

765
00:45:06,270 --> 00:45:11,270
they reconnect the line for the house
and all of a sudden the oil tank is now

766
00:45:13,891 --> 00:45:17,370
calling the now defunct and now that
number belongs to somebody else.

767
00:45:17,371 --> 00:45:20,910
And it took them six weeks to figure it
out. And everybody can have a big laugh.

768
00:45:21,390 --> 00:45:23,580
But at the time people were just like,
I don't understand.

769
00:45:23,581 --> 00:45:26,220
Like is there a ghost in this house?
Like what is going on?

770
00:45:26,550 --> 00:45:30,330
And I worry about that for the Internet
of things is that we've had them so

771
00:45:30,331 --> 00:45:34,410
embedded that as that
technology becomes obsolete,

772
00:45:34,450 --> 00:45:36,810
are we going to remember it's
there and what happens when it,

773
00:45:36,990 --> 00:45:40,800
they think actually a lightening strike
is what turned everything back on.

774
00:45:41,160 --> 00:45:42,990
So it's almost like it
rebooted the program.

775
00:45:43,440 --> 00:45:46,560
And so what happens when
we forget they're there?

776
00:45:49,230 --> 00:45:49,810
Yes,

777
00:45:49,810 --> 00:45:53,190
I thank you for your talk. I work in
user experience for Security and privacy,

778
00:45:53,250 --> 00:45:55,280
so I appreciate it. A
lot of what you said. Um,

779
00:45:55,530 --> 00:45:59,250
what are the top pieces of advice you
would give a consumer today to protect

780
00:45:59,251 --> 00:46:00,360
themselves online?

781
00:46:01,190 --> 00:46:02,380
Or a couple of things.
I mean,

782
00:46:02,390 --> 00:46:07,390
one is never use free Wifi
and it's one of those things,

783
00:46:08,691 --> 00:46:13,190
you know. So I took, uh, our intern
Steven to a coffee shop in Charlotte,

784
00:46:13,191 --> 00:46:18,050
which is a huge banking town. And I told
him, take your pineapple, take your Mac.

785
00:46:18,051 --> 00:46:20,840
I'm going to take my pineapple on my Mac
and I'm going to hack you and see how

786
00:46:20,841 --> 00:46:23,090
you do and then you're going to
hack me back and see how you do.

787
00:46:23,540 --> 00:46:26,900
And because we have this whole moral
ethics code at four Dulles where we say,

788
00:46:26,901 --> 00:46:30,230
just because you can doesn't mean
you should. He said to me, ma'am,

789
00:46:30,231 --> 00:46:33,020
how are we going to make sure we don't
accidentally hack other people in the

790
00:46:33,021 --> 00:46:35,330
coffee shop? I said, it's very simple.

791
00:46:35,331 --> 00:46:38,920
What we're gonna do is we're
going to name our wifi hotspots,

792
00:46:38,921 --> 00:46:40,580
something nobody would ever connect to.

793
00:46:41,150 --> 00:46:42,980
So we're not going to name
at the coffee shop name,

794
00:46:42,981 --> 00:46:47,480
we're going to name it
something ridiculous. So I
named the first iteration,

795
00:46:47,481 --> 00:46:52,481
I named it and I named it fake Wifi and
five people connected within minutes.

796
00:46:53,120 --> 00:46:56,540
And so people's traffic are coming by
and Steven's getting upset and I said

797
00:46:56,541 --> 00:46:58,970
that's okay. Well I'm plugging it,
Steve, I'm going to let you name it.

798
00:46:59,380 --> 00:47:04,380
So he says no one will ever connect to
this network and it calls it data stealer

799
00:47:05,420 --> 00:47:06,800
and 10 people connected.

800
00:47:07,100 --> 00:47:10,220
And so my point in bringing this up
is it's like you have people who,

801
00:47:10,221 --> 00:47:14,180
I know data plans are really expensive
and so they're trying to use free wifi

802
00:47:14,181 --> 00:47:17,810
everywhere they go and they don't really
realize that they need to be using a

803
00:47:17,811 --> 00:47:21,470
virtual private network in addition
to using that free Wifi to help.

804
00:47:21,500 --> 00:47:26,120
Not that doesn't block 100% of all
bad things, but it sure helps a ton.

805
00:47:26,270 --> 00:47:29,470
So that would be the first thing is get
a really good VPN that you're really

806
00:47:29,471 --> 00:47:31,780
comfortable with.
Use that everywhere you go,

807
00:47:31,781 --> 00:47:34,150
especially when you go
overseas on vacation.

808
00:47:34,151 --> 00:47:37,930
Cause that's a really popular
time for people to get hit. Uh,

809
00:47:38,020 --> 00:47:41,080
don't use free Wifi.
But if you have to have that Vpn,

810
00:47:41,320 --> 00:47:42,670
I also say segment your life.

811
00:47:42,671 --> 00:47:46,060
So just like we talked about network
segmentation and data segmentation.

812
00:47:46,061 --> 00:47:48,070
Really briefly segment your life.

813
00:47:48,100 --> 00:47:52,660
Have one email address that you use with
your bank that you don't use anywhere

814
00:47:52,661 --> 00:47:53,021
else.

815
00:47:53,021 --> 00:47:55,780
Have one with your health care because
health insurance fraud is really high

816
00:47:55,781 --> 00:47:59,470
right now. Have one that you use
for sensitive confidential emails.

817
00:47:59,530 --> 00:48:03,670
I hate email but sometimes the
person on the other end of the line,

818
00:48:03,671 --> 00:48:06,460
the only thing they want to do is
send me this confidential email.

819
00:48:06,461 --> 00:48:11,230
And so I personally for that use
a whole different email platform,

820
00:48:11,590 --> 00:48:15,970
a two factor authentication that
is annoying to most consumers.

821
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:18,700
Just understand that they don't like it,
they don't want to do it.

822
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:21,050
But if you're somebody who's um,

823
00:48:21,970 --> 00:48:26,740
on line and you've got that
particular email tied to other things,

824
00:48:26,741 --> 00:48:31,600
you need two factor authentication. Uh,
and then kind of the last thing would be,

825
00:48:32,320 --> 00:48:32,531
you know,

826
00:48:32,531 --> 00:48:37,531
as it relates to any of the major issues
that are going on in the world and in

827
00:48:37,751 --> 00:48:41,140
this country,
do your homework.

828
00:48:41,260 --> 00:48:46,260
Don't allow things that are posted on
your friend's walls and on your wall.

829
00:48:46,750 --> 00:48:49,810
Don't allow that to create
extreme emotions for you.

830
00:48:49,811 --> 00:48:53,230
Whether those are highs or lows,
do your homework,

831
00:48:53,260 --> 00:48:57,790
pick out your own news organizations
that are on both sides of different

832
00:48:57,791 --> 00:49:02,791
arguments and don't react to what you're
seeing right now and make sure you,

833
00:49:04,271 --> 00:49:07,450
you do your own homework and things so
that you can really think and make up

834
00:49:07,451 --> 00:49:08,620
your own mind for yourself.

835
00:49:08,621 --> 00:49:12,820
So those would be some of the bigger
things that I would advise. Yup.

836
00:49:12,910 --> 00:49:13,743
Great question.

837
00:49:14,570 --> 00:49:16,080
Great. Our next question is, um,

838
00:49:16,160 --> 00:49:18,590
you mentioned being cautious
of new laws in this space.

839
00:49:19,280 --> 00:49:22,280
What steps should lawmakers and
or the government in general,

840
00:49:22,281 --> 00:49:25,040
it'd be taking to keep us safe online,

841
00:49:25,310 --> 00:49:28,580
especially when we consider one a cry
and the impact that it had on the health

842
00:49:28,581 --> 00:49:29,080
sector?

843
00:49:29,080 --> 00:49:33,800
Yeah, it's a very fair question and
uh, you know, it's interesting. I,

844
00:49:34,510 --> 00:49:38,020
if anything actually
gets passed on the hill.

845
00:49:38,021 --> 00:49:40,810
So that's kind of the first big one,
which is they're not getting along.

846
00:49:40,811 --> 00:49:42,190
I don't know if you've noticed and not,

847
00:49:42,430 --> 00:49:46,630
not a lot has been passed in recent years,
but if anything were to pass,

848
00:49:46,631 --> 00:49:49,540
given what's happened
in the past with OPM,

849
00:49:49,930 --> 00:49:53,080
with some of the credit card breaches.
But when you look at Experian,

850
00:49:53,320 --> 00:49:57,310
that's permanent data.
So the last breaches were credit cards.

851
00:49:57,311 --> 00:50:02,311
You get a new credit card basically after
a year you should be fine experience.

852
00:50:02,530 --> 00:50:05,320
You're never getting a new mothers
may name social security number,

853
00:50:05,321 --> 00:50:07,780
date of birth,
they can wait 10 years.

854
00:50:07,781 --> 00:50:12,550
And that data's still golden until America
as a government figures out what our

855
00:50:12,551 --> 00:50:16,720
new identification Schema is going to
be for the different parts of your life,

856
00:50:17,110 --> 00:50:21,370
whether it's the IRS or a security
or whatever it is. And so I'll,

857
00:50:22,060 --> 00:50:27,060
I would be a big fan of seeing some
type of a consumer bill of rights around

858
00:50:27,200 --> 00:50:28,760
data and data privacy.

859
00:50:28,761 --> 00:50:33,761
But I am hesitant to push for something
like that because I worry that by the

860
00:50:33,771 --> 00:50:38,630
time it's inaccurate, it's out of
date. And then two, I worry that,

861
00:50:38,920 --> 00:50:41,010
well meaning well-intended,

862
00:50:41,030 --> 00:50:46,030
but not technical people will be dictating
for companies how to technically take

863
00:50:46,281 --> 00:50:51,020
care of that. But, uh, but if you
were to ask the hill for anything,

864
00:50:51,080 --> 00:50:55,310
I would ask the hill, uh, for
things that are incentive based.

865
00:50:55,430 --> 00:50:56,480
So for example,

866
00:50:56,660 --> 00:51:01,660
I would love to see companies that invest
in security and privacy get an r and d

867
00:51:02,211 --> 00:51:03,470
tax credit for that.

868
00:51:03,950 --> 00:51:07,370
How about the fact that you're being a
good citizen and you're investing money

869
00:51:07,670 --> 00:51:09,680
and thinking about this
problem differently.

870
00:51:09,920 --> 00:51:11,900
Why not give you a tax
break for doing that?

871
00:51:12,140 --> 00:51:16,430
So why don't we think instead about
sort of onerous regulatory burdens,

872
00:51:16,700 --> 00:51:21,320
why don't we think of incentives and
saying for companies who do right by this,

873
00:51:21,530 --> 00:51:23,860
let's give them a break for,
you know,

874
00:51:23,870 --> 00:51:27,830
designing differently and designing
for the human instead of designing and

875
00:51:27,831 --> 00:51:29,330
saying the humans the weakest link.

876
00:51:32,130 --> 00:51:36,990
And, um, we'll take one more
question again. Um, this is,

877
00:51:36,991 --> 00:51:38,220
I think the most fun one.
Oh,

878
00:51:38,221 --> 00:51:41,790
what was the most difficult fugitive
strategy to figure out on hunted or

879
00:51:41,791 --> 00:51:46,590
otherwise? What were some of the most
creative and effective disappearances?

880
00:51:47,220 --> 00:51:49,830
Wow, that's a good way. I
mean, candidly, I'll give,

881
00:51:49,831 --> 00:51:53,760
try and Shelly some
real props. Uh, so what,

882
00:51:53,761 --> 00:51:56,400
what you need to know for those of you,
if you haven't watched the show yet,

883
00:51:56,401 --> 00:52:00,570
you can binge watch it on. And again, my
mom says it's a must march show, but uh,

884
00:52:00,870 --> 00:52:04,500
you can binge watch it on CBS on demand
and I think it's on Hulu and Amazon.

885
00:52:04,501 --> 00:52:08,650
You can download the series. And one of
the things about Troy and Shelly, um, it,

886
00:52:08,750 --> 00:52:10,740
well for you to know
about all the fugitives,

887
00:52:10,830 --> 00:52:14,790
I had no idea what they went through
other than the capture and they didn't let

888
00:52:14,791 --> 00:52:17,160
me see it until the show aired.

889
00:52:17,161 --> 00:52:21,750
So I learned with everybody at home where
people really were and the near misses

890
00:52:21,751 --> 00:52:26,460
that we had. And so Troy and Shelly, they
were actually in the swamp for 14 days,

891
00:52:26,461 --> 00:52:28,860
straight canoeing past alligators.

892
00:52:28,890 --> 00:52:30,630
I don't know if you've spent
any time in the Florida swamp.

893
00:52:30,660 --> 00:52:32,490
It is not a pretty place to be.

894
00:52:32,910 --> 00:52:36,720
And so I give them total
props for doing that. And uh,

895
00:52:36,840 --> 00:52:41,520
it was really their friends commenting
on there, they're wanted page, uh,

896
00:52:41,650 --> 00:52:45,300
that really kind of helped us figure
out who would be in the local area that

897
00:52:45,301 --> 00:52:46,890
might be helping them.
Uh,

898
00:52:46,891 --> 00:52:51,891
another kind of creative thing that David
and Emily did was David had actually,

899
00:52:54,720 --> 00:52:55,200
uh,

900
00:52:55,200 --> 00:53:00,200
when in that first hour before they're
given a full hour ahead of us knowing who

901
00:53:00,751 --> 00:53:03,660
they are to do anything they
want to do to get ready,

902
00:53:03,661 --> 00:53:06,660
but they have to show their getting
ready and that they weren't a prepper in

903
00:53:06,661 --> 00:53:07,494
advance.

904
00:53:07,920 --> 00:53:12,920
And one of the things he did was he
called different people to have them be

905
00:53:13,831 --> 00:53:17,430
lifelines in line over
the course of the 20 days.

906
00:53:17,970 --> 00:53:19,290
And he set up,

907
00:53:19,291 --> 00:53:23,160
basically they were three degrees of
separation away from him and they did all

908
00:53:23,161 --> 00:53:24,600
the coordination for him.

909
00:53:25,200 --> 00:53:28,890
And so even though we're trying to surveil
him and his family and Emily and her

910
00:53:28,891 --> 00:53:33,180
family really, he had gone way
out of his circle of trust.

911
00:53:33,450 --> 00:53:35,860
And so that made it harder
for us to figure out who,

912
00:53:36,080 --> 00:53:40,860
cause you can only surveil so many
people in 28 days and convinced the court

913
00:53:41,100 --> 00:53:43,620
too. You have to have just cars
to put people under surveillance.

914
00:53:43,621 --> 00:53:46,480
You have to have a really well
written warrant for that. I was,

915
00:53:46,481 --> 00:53:51,120
that was another really good strategy.
And then you know, it was interesting,

916
00:53:51,480 --> 00:53:53,430
the boys will and miles would,

917
00:53:53,431 --> 00:53:57,270
they basically did was they just lived
off of the kindness of strangers,

918
00:53:57,720 --> 00:54:02,040
which really was going to work
for them until I'm one of the,

919
00:54:03,390 --> 00:54:05,940
one of the people who was
helping them out. Um, the,

920
00:54:05,941 --> 00:54:10,170
the friend wanted to go to a movie and
they didn't want to leave the boys alone

921
00:54:10,171 --> 00:54:11,400
in the vacation rental.

922
00:54:11,670 --> 00:54:15,480
And so she actually called our tip line
and turn them in because she was tired

923
00:54:15,481 --> 00:54:16,350
of them hanging out.

924
00:54:16,351 --> 00:54:20,010
So it's like when you do on the kindness
of strangers and they had no digital

925
00:54:20,011 --> 00:54:23,820
footprint. The only, only thing I
thought was when I read their profile,

926
00:54:23,821 --> 00:54:27,060
I said they're going to go to the beach
and cause the hundred thousand square

927
00:54:27,060 --> 00:54:29,430
miles was the southeast for season one.
So I said,

928
00:54:29,431 --> 00:54:32,320
they're going to go to the beach
because they can blend in. They kind of,

929
00:54:32,340 --> 00:54:34,920
you know, they're young men, they're
going to blend in at the beach.

930
00:54:34,950 --> 00:54:39,000
They like to have a good time.
That's a great place to hide. And so,

931
00:54:39,030 --> 00:54:42,630
but there's myrtle beach and there's
Florida beaches and there's all kinds of

932
00:54:42,631 --> 00:54:45,630
beaches. And a, that's
really was their undoing,

933
00:54:45,631 --> 00:54:49,110
was living off the kindness of strangers
and one of them got tired of them and

934
00:54:49,111 --> 00:54:49,944
turn them in.

935
00:54:51,050 --> 00:54:51,321
Excellent.

936
00:54:51,321 --> 00:54:54,740
Well this has been really fascinating and
we do appreciate you joining us today.

937
00:54:54,830 --> 00:54:58,250
I'm so a big round of applause
for chase everybody. Thank you.
