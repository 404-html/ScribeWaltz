1
00:00:06,030 --> 00:00:08,220
It is my pleasure to
have here with us today,

2
00:00:08,221 --> 00:00:10,880
Ravi Auger Wall to discuss his new book,
uh,

3
00:00:11,090 --> 00:00:15,000
into your connected how the smartphone
revolution is transforming the world's

4
00:00:15,090 --> 00:00:16,530
largest democracy.

5
00:00:16,920 --> 00:00:21,090
Mr Ogre Wall is currently the managing
editor of foreign policy magazine.

6
00:00:21,390 --> 00:00:25,230
Before that, he spent more than a decade
with CNN where he worked in New York,

7
00:00:25,231 --> 00:00:29,280
London, and most recently in New Delhi
where he was the region's bureau chief.

8
00:00:29,610 --> 00:00:33,390
The book has received quite a
bit of praise already for reads.

9
00:00:33,391 --> 00:00:38,220
Acarya calls it quite simply the best
book about India Today. Nicholas Thompson,

10
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:42,990
the editor in chief of wired magazine
says the story of how India got wired is

11
00:00:42,991 --> 00:00:44,730
one of the most important
in the world today.

12
00:00:44,940 --> 00:00:47,520
And you won't find a better
guide than Ravi occur wall.

13
00:00:47,700 --> 00:00:51,660
That conversation couldn't be more
important for us here at Google, uh,

14
00:00:51,661 --> 00:00:55,830
to embrace robustly just given the fact
that we are one of the key drivers of

15
00:00:55,831 --> 00:00:57,240
the smartphone revolution.

16
00:00:57,270 --> 00:01:00,900
80% of the smartphones in
India are android smartphones.

17
00:01:01,200 --> 00:01:06,200
So I don't think we can be thoughtful
enough about ensuring that our products

18
00:01:06,871 --> 00:01:11,400
and technologies not only help build
a more technologically enabled India,

19
00:01:11,670 --> 00:01:14,050
but a better India.
And to unpack the,

20
00:01:14,051 --> 00:01:18,900
still discuss that even further. Um,
I'll bring grubby up on the stage.

21
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:29,390
I want to start off with,
with the smartphone revolution,

22
00:01:29,391 --> 00:01:33,440
you talk about how in two thousand twenty
million Indians were connected to the

23
00:01:33,441 --> 00:01:37,070
Internet, uh, in 2017, that
number was 465 million.

24
00:01:37,400 --> 00:01:41,060
And your project in 2025 that, that
number is going to be more than a billion.

25
00:01:41,540 --> 00:01:42,290
And you,

26
00:01:42,290 --> 00:01:45,290
you talk about the ways in which that's
similar to kind of the advent of the

27
00:01:45,291 --> 00:01:50,291
automobile and the transformational impact
that it had here in the United States

28
00:01:50,331 --> 00:01:54,860
from kind of the creation of suburbia,
the interstate highway to where, uh,

29
00:01:54,950 --> 00:01:59,390
very often someone got their first
kiss longer weekends hub, all sorts of,

30
00:01:59,630 --> 00:02:01,160
kind of tremendous impacts.

31
00:02:01,161 --> 00:02:05,540
And you talk about how the smartphone
is doing the same in India,

32
00:02:05,930 --> 00:02:10,700
which makes it not just simply an
evolution as it's been here in the United

33
00:02:10,700 --> 00:02:11,870
States,
but a revolution.

34
00:02:11,871 --> 00:02:15,980
So we'd love for you to kind of talk
about how India got here to this moment.

35
00:02:16,300 --> 00:02:20,660
Where is it right now and where do you
anticipate it's going to be 10 years from

36
00:02:20,661 --> 00:02:22,600
now as a result of the
smartphone revolution?

37
00:02:23,320 --> 00:02:25,810
That's a great question. Thank
you for having me. Thank you.

38
00:02:25,811 --> 00:02:28,540
All of you for attending.
And really it's,

39
00:02:28,541 --> 00:02:32,020
it's very special for me to come
speak at Google and as Ron said,

40
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:37,320
Google is playing such a huge role and
the growth of the Internet in India and

41
00:02:37,780 --> 00:02:41,560
in fact expanding the pie
of Internet users in India.

42
00:02:41,860 --> 00:02:42,910
So to begin with,

43
00:02:42,911 --> 00:02:47,830
you at your first point about how India
is going through a smartphone revolution,

44
00:02:48,130 --> 00:02:52,060
the reason why I use the word revolution
in the book, and I don't use it lightly,

45
00:02:52,061 --> 00:02:56,530
is to contrast it with the
way in which the West has.

46
00:02:56,710 --> 00:03:00,190
People in the West have discovered the
internet. So for of you in this room,

47
00:03:00,490 --> 00:03:03,040
you know,
my assumption would be that you know,

48
00:03:03,041 --> 00:03:08,041
sometime in the late 1990s you had a
PC and a telephone land line and then

49
00:03:08,201 --> 00:03:13,201
you've got a dial up internet connection
and then you evolved from there to a

50
00:03:13,390 --> 00:03:17,490
DSL and cable broadband. And then
you've got your routers, you had Wifi,

51
00:03:18,130 --> 00:03:22,300
and then eventually you have three g on
the phone for g and a phone and you are

52
00:03:22,301 --> 00:03:25,240
where you are today. Um, in India,

53
00:03:25,300 --> 00:03:28,870
a very small slice of Indians
who were rich, privileged,

54
00:03:29,140 --> 00:03:33,670
usually urban, often male, um,
had access to those things.

55
00:03:33,671 --> 00:03:38,470
Only 2% of Indians had access to
telephone landlines in the year 2000.

56
00:03:38,680 --> 00:03:43,330
A similar percentage of Indians had access
to pcs and that's why there were only

57
00:03:43,331 --> 00:03:48,331
20 million Indians online in the year
2000 and the numbers then begin to jump

58
00:03:48,431 --> 00:03:53,350
very rapidly. In 2010, there were
100 million Indians online. By 2015,

59
00:03:53,351 --> 00:03:58,351
there were 300 million Indians online
and now we're crossing off a billion.

60
00:03:58,990 --> 00:04:03,990
The projections are that it'll reach
800 million by 2025 and then a billion

61
00:04:04,031 --> 00:04:08,980
shortly thereafter. All of this growth
is going to come from smartphones. Um,

62
00:04:09,010 --> 00:04:13,660
why? Because smartphones in India are
very cheap. They are easily accessible.

63
00:04:13,960 --> 00:04:15,910
They are for most Indians,

64
00:04:15,911 --> 00:04:20,740
not just a smartphone as it is for
you guys here. For most Indians,

65
00:04:20,741 --> 00:04:24,490
the smartphone is their first camera.
It is their first screen.

66
00:04:24,760 --> 00:04:27,940
It is also their first Walkman,
an MP three player.

67
00:04:28,120 --> 00:04:33,120
It is a first of many things in one device
and that's why it's as transformative

68
00:04:33,791 --> 00:04:38,440
as it is for most Indians. This is a
gateway to many forms of technology.

69
00:04:38,500 --> 00:04:43,400
All of it in one go. You could
be illiterate in India. Um,

70
00:04:43,410 --> 00:04:46,600
and you can still speak to
your phone. Uh, you, you know,

71
00:04:46,601 --> 00:04:49,630
the old Internet was mostly
for English speakers in India.

72
00:04:49,631 --> 00:04:53,260
The new Internet is for people
who speak, uh, you know,

73
00:04:53,261 --> 00:04:56,740
a multitude of Indian languages
and thanks to Google in part,

74
00:04:56,920 --> 00:05:00,940
those languages are all now
accessible on the internet. Um,

75
00:05:01,750 --> 00:05:05,020
there's a great analogy with
the car which you brought up.

76
00:05:05,020 --> 00:05:10,020
And I like to compare the moment that
India is going through right now to the

77
00:05:10,301 --> 00:05:14,800
moment that America went through
a century ago. So, you know,

78
00:05:14,801 --> 00:05:19,801
America invented the car and with the car
you created roads and highways and the

79
00:05:20,681 --> 00:05:23,320
interstate system.
And then with that,

80
00:05:23,470 --> 00:05:28,180
tens of thousands of jobs are created
and America built suburbia and the picket

81
00:05:28,181 --> 00:05:31,240
fence home.
And with that you have the commute.

82
00:05:31,570 --> 00:05:34,630
And along the commute you needed
to create an infrastructure.

83
00:05:34,631 --> 00:05:39,631
So that infrastructure was gas stations
and multiplexes and movie theaters and

84
00:05:40,900 --> 00:05:42,130
the drive in restaurant.

85
00:05:42,131 --> 00:05:46,960
And so much more the seven eleven's think
of all of those things as a national

86
00:05:47,020 --> 00:05:48,910
infrastructure across the country.

87
00:05:49,180 --> 00:05:54,160
And it wasn't just that there was a
cultural and an imaginative infrastructure

88
00:05:54,161 --> 00:05:56,740
as well. I mean, for most Americans,

89
00:05:57,080 --> 00:06:00,170
the car was their first private property.

90
00:06:00,470 --> 00:06:04,670
It was literally a tool
of mobility. It was, uh,

91
00:06:04,790 --> 00:06:08,810
the vehicle in which they sort of
injected their dreams and their ambitions.

92
00:06:08,930 --> 00:06:12,890
You know, for the baby boomer generation
in Hollywood, it was enshrined, I mean,

93
00:06:12,891 --> 00:06:16,430
think of the race and the
chase and the bank heist.

94
00:06:16,431 --> 00:06:21,020
Every Hollywood movie of a certain
era was defined around the car,

95
00:06:21,021 --> 00:06:23,000
the car defined Americans.

96
00:06:23,001 --> 00:06:27,320
I mean if you drove a pickup
truck or a sedan or a hatchback,

97
00:06:27,321 --> 00:06:30,380
it kind of explained who you
were and where you were headed.

98
00:06:31,190 --> 00:06:35,300
Take all of those things
and transpose it to India.

99
00:06:35,301 --> 00:06:39,770
Today the smartphone defines who you are.

100
00:06:39,771 --> 00:06:44,771
You an iPhone person and therefore do
you have $1,200 to spend on a phone?

101
00:06:45,560 --> 00:06:47,870
Likely not in India. And
being, because as we know,

102
00:06:48,170 --> 00:06:51,790
apple hasn't been able to make
serious inroads into India. Um,

103
00:06:52,040 --> 00:06:56,150
but the phone says a lot more about
who you are. And by the same token,

104
00:06:56,151 --> 00:07:00,860
the phone is creating an entire
infrastructure of payments,

105
00:07:00,861 --> 00:07:05,300
of communication. It's
building trust, um, with maps,

106
00:07:05,301 --> 00:07:09,710
with education,
with various tools that people are using.

107
00:07:10,130 --> 00:07:10,963
Um,

108
00:07:11,480 --> 00:07:16,370
for all of those reasons for a country
that is as young as India is average age,

109
00:07:16,371 --> 00:07:20,600
27,
average income less than $2,000 a year,

110
00:07:20,990 --> 00:07:25,250
you take all of those things together
for country that's marching and on the

111
00:07:25,251 --> 00:07:30,110
rise. And the thesis of my
book is that this one device,

112
00:07:30,111 --> 00:07:35,111
this one tool will end up being
incredibly transformative for the country.

113
00:07:36,070 --> 00:07:36,930
That's no,
and I,

114
00:07:36,931 --> 00:07:40,590
I think one of those stories that you
start the book off that really illustrates

115
00:07:40,591 --> 00:07:44,920
that compellingly as the
story of pool with you, uh,

116
00:07:44,950 --> 00:07:49,260
who is a Google saute and you can explain
what that is. Um, I have to admit,

117
00:07:49,261 --> 00:07:51,960
I fell a little bit in love with
Paul with a reading about her.

118
00:07:51,961 --> 00:07:54,820
She's like on her bicycle
going around rural Rajasthan,

119
00:07:54,940 --> 00:07:59,040
introducing the Internet for the first
time to, uh, to women in these villages.

120
00:07:59,780 --> 00:08:04,290
Would love for you to kind of talk about
how you first found her, her story,

121
00:08:04,291 --> 00:08:09,291
and then what kind of broader lessons
we can draw about her example.

122
00:08:09,450 --> 00:08:13,160
Uh, and the penetration of India
should not only for women, but for,

123
00:08:13,190 --> 00:08:14,040
for rural communities.

124
00:08:14,340 --> 00:08:18,540
Sure. It's so great to talk
about food. Let the hair,
cause I'm coming full circle.

125
00:08:18,541 --> 00:08:22,560
I found [inaudible] through Google.
Um, and not the search engine,

126
00:08:22,561 --> 00:08:24,720
but literally threw
people at Google who said,

127
00:08:24,721 --> 00:08:28,650
you must take a look at Google Southie
and you must look into this story.

128
00:08:28,651 --> 00:08:33,330
And so I did. Um, for those of you
don't know, Google Southie is a program,

129
00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:33,920
uh,

130
00:08:33,920 --> 00:08:38,920
at Google where Google is partnered
with many NGOs across the country.

131
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:43,170
And it is, um, uh, giving, uh,

132
00:08:43,171 --> 00:08:47,610
first of all it's training rural women
how to use the internet and then it's

133
00:08:47,670 --> 00:08:49,560
arming them with,
uh,

134
00:08:49,590 --> 00:08:54,590
smartphones and tablets and a bicycle
to then go out into other villages,

135
00:08:55,530 --> 00:08:58,710
teach and train other women
how to use the Internet,

136
00:08:58,711 --> 00:09:03,520
how to familiarize themselves with the
Internet. Why is this important? Well, um,

137
00:09:04,650 --> 00:09:06,750
you might remember when
I was starting off,

138
00:09:06,751 --> 00:09:11,670
I said the old Internet in
India was urban, elite and male.

139
00:09:12,110 --> 00:09:16,920
Uh, it was also English. Um, and
the reason why I say mail is that,

140
00:09:17,240 --> 00:09:19,590
uh, even in 2014, uh,

141
00:09:19,591 --> 00:09:23,700
about 70% of internet
users in India were male.

142
00:09:24,150 --> 00:09:26,640
30% were women in villages.
Uh,

143
00:09:26,641 --> 00:09:29,760
only one out of 10
Internet users were women.

144
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:35,100
And so the big gap was rural
women and women more nationally.

145
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:39,360
Google obviously, you know,
and you guys work on this,

146
00:09:39,390 --> 00:09:44,280
realize that this was a great market to
tab and not just for economic reasons,

147
00:09:44,281 --> 00:09:49,140
but also for humanitarian reasons.
And so the southeast,

148
00:09:49,141 --> 00:09:50,400
what they've been doing is,

149
00:09:50,460 --> 00:09:54,420
is in a sort of peer to
peer conversational way,

150
00:09:54,750 --> 00:09:58,200
have been able to train other
rural women to use the Internet.

151
00:09:58,500 --> 00:10:00,420
And the reason why this
is important again,

152
00:10:00,421 --> 00:10:04,890
is that illiteracy is rife in
these parts of India. Um, you know,

153
00:10:04,891 --> 00:10:08,450
in Roger Stone, the state in
which I met fool with the, um,

154
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:12,570
female literacy rates are about 50%,

155
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:17,940
which means there are all these women
who cannot read or write anything at all.

156
00:10:18,390 --> 00:10:21,720
And so the Internet for them was always
going to be a thing that they could

157
00:10:21,721 --> 00:10:26,670
never dream of using, not on a PC, not
on a phone, not on a regular phone.

158
00:10:27,030 --> 00:10:30,780
And voice technology changed
all of that food with the, uh,

159
00:10:30,781 --> 00:10:34,380
and I begin the book with
her speaking to some,

160
00:10:34,410 --> 00:10:38,880
some other villages and she says,
uh, you know, all us, this thing,

161
00:10:38,910 --> 00:10:42,900
Google asked something and most of them
don't know what to ask. I mean, you know,

162
00:10:42,901 --> 00:10:47,370
and then one woman says, well, um,
you know, show us the Taj Mahal.

163
00:10:47,850 --> 00:10:52,170
And a video pops up. Uh, she
says it in Hindi. She says,

164
00:10:52,171 --> 00:10:53,010
Mojay Taj Mahal,

165
00:10:53,011 --> 00:10:57,600
the cow and a video pops
up and they press play.

166
00:10:57,870 --> 00:11:02,220
And for the first time they see moving
imagery of this monument that they have

167
00:11:02,221 --> 00:11:06,180
all grown up as knowing as the
most beautiful thing in India.

168
00:11:06,530 --> 00:11:11,120
It was a very profound moving moment
for me as well to see that. And, uh,

169
00:11:11,520 --> 00:11:13,410
it gives you a sense of,
of,

170
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:18,760
of how technology really can break through
so many of the boundaries that we've

171
00:11:20,251 --> 00:11:22,350
built in India,
not just gender,

172
00:11:22,351 --> 00:11:26,760
but also costs and geography
and language and literacy.

173
00:11:27,180 --> 00:11:30,720
Um, and fool with the was, uh,

174
00:11:30,721 --> 00:11:35,721
if you read the book was just a great
example of a woman who was completely in

175
00:11:36,481 --> 00:11:39,690
debatable and spirit. And, uh, you know,

176
00:11:39,691 --> 00:11:44,400
was able to venture out into all these
villages and very enthusiastically be

177
00:11:44,401 --> 00:11:48,690
sort of a, an internet evangelist,
uh, or Google evangelist.

178
00:11:49,050 --> 00:11:52,950
Uh, and she was paid only a very
small amount of money, uh, to do this,

179
00:11:52,960 --> 00:11:57,420
but was doing it mostly because she, she
was really excited about the project. Um,

180
00:11:57,610 --> 00:12:00,070
for those of you been to
India, you know, it's,

181
00:12:00,071 --> 00:12:03,850
it's quite rare to see women on bicycles
wearing a full sorry and heading out

182
00:12:03,851 --> 00:12:07,180
into the villages and you know, the
southeast are doing just that, uh,

183
00:12:07,181 --> 00:12:11,290
which is a real testament to
their enthusiasm for the Internet.

184
00:12:11,890 --> 00:12:15,340
Yeah. And it's, it's what's, what
was interesting about her cases, you,

185
00:12:15,670 --> 00:12:18,850
you talk about the fact that she had a
husband that was like very supportive of,

186
00:12:19,060 --> 00:12:19,871
of what she was doing,

187
00:12:19,871 --> 00:12:23,500
which enabled her to be
such an enthusiastic kind
of ambassador for the Sati

188
00:12:23,530 --> 00:12:26,860
program. Uh, there was a quote in the
book where you talk about, you brought up,

189
00:12:26,861 --> 00:12:31,000
cast you where you talk about how Carl
Marx and the 1850 [inaudible] thought

190
00:12:31,001 --> 00:12:35,050
that the railroad was going to get
rid of the caste system in India. Um,

191
00:12:35,290 --> 00:12:38,440
and there've been all
sorts of technologies since
then that have been like,

192
00:12:38,441 --> 00:12:43,060
this is the vanguard of like maybe
pushing against some of these more ancient

193
00:12:43,061 --> 00:12:48,060
social or cultural systems. Uh,
and those obviously failed. Um,

194
00:12:48,100 --> 00:12:51,550
but you feel more bullish
about the smartphone. Um,

195
00:12:51,700 --> 00:12:55,450
what's different about the smartphone
that you feel is going to break through

196
00:12:55,451 --> 00:13:00,190
some of these more, uh, older
kind of patriarchal systems?

197
00:13:00,540 --> 00:13:04,410
So I am more bullish.
Um,

198
00:13:04,650 --> 00:13:06,840
there are still obstacles,
for example,

199
00:13:06,870 --> 00:13:10,860
their entire villages in India where
the smartphone is banned for women. Uh,

200
00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:15,360
and I go to one of these villages in good
drive and the men I spoke to their, uh,

201
00:13:15,420 --> 00:13:19,980
sad that, you know, women just can't
use this. They're not smart enough.

202
00:13:19,981 --> 00:13:24,840
They don't have the, they, they, they're
not capable of dealing with the Internet.

203
00:13:24,841 --> 00:13:25,380
And,

204
00:13:25,380 --> 00:13:29,130
and really what they were trying to tell
me without saying it in as many words,

205
00:13:29,131 --> 00:13:34,131
is that they were frightened of what it
would mean to give women access to the

206
00:13:34,381 --> 00:13:38,310
Internet. They were frightened of
what it meant to give women freedom.

207
00:13:39,390 --> 00:13:42,960
You know, they had built
around, um, in fact,

208
00:13:42,990 --> 00:13:47,490
entire societies were
built around, uh, you know,

209
00:13:48,060 --> 00:13:52,470
patriarchal systems where women had
very little agency. And so in a sense,

210
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:57,570
one of the greatest obstacles to
allowing the Internet to reach,

211
00:13:57,690 --> 00:14:02,640
uh, all Indians is his men and
mostly rural land. But that sad.

212
00:14:02,700 --> 00:14:03,533
Um,

213
00:14:03,660 --> 00:14:07,980
I think the reason why I'm more
bullish about the phone than any other

214
00:14:08,340 --> 00:14:13,340
technology is that the phone is a
catalyst and it's coming at a moment when,

215
00:14:15,990 --> 00:14:20,810
so first of all, it is cheap. It is
accessible, it is aspirational. Um,

216
00:14:21,690 --> 00:14:26,220
but it's coming along with
a range of other forces.

217
00:14:26,250 --> 00:14:31,250
There's a confluence of events at play
and those events are globalization,

218
00:14:32,070 --> 00:14:37,020
cheap technology, the creation
of smartphones, which,
you know, let's face it,

219
00:14:37,021 --> 00:14:39,240
our unprecedentedly,
you know,

220
00:14:39,241 --> 00:14:44,241
compact and powerful and able to take
all of these things into one device,

221
00:14:44,850 --> 00:14:47,860
all of these other devices
into one device. Um,

222
00:14:47,910 --> 00:14:50,880
but also rising income levels in India.

223
00:14:51,260 --> 00:14:56,260
The ability for a bigger Indian
companies to take big decisions,

224
00:14:57,561 --> 00:15:01,700
set up big infrastructural projects.
You may have heard of reliance Geo,

225
00:15:01,701 --> 00:15:05,210
which is a company that you know for
the first six months of its launch

226
00:15:05,211 --> 00:15:07,280
essentially made data free in India.

227
00:15:07,730 --> 00:15:10,730
So if you look at all of
those things together,

228
00:15:10,731 --> 00:15:15,731
we're at a moment fairly unprecedented
in India's history where the smartphone

229
00:15:17,150 --> 00:15:22,150
is just perfectly poised to reach so
many people and to give them all these

230
00:15:22,491 --> 00:15:25,850
different things in one goal that
we're not going to happen organically.

231
00:15:25,940 --> 00:15:29,330
Your PC is we're not going to
reach a majority of Indians,

232
00:15:29,331 --> 00:15:33,710
organically cameras. We're not going to
reach a majority of Indians organically,

233
00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:35,480
but you put it into one device.

234
00:15:35,481 --> 00:15:40,430
You put all of these things in one
device at a very low price point. A Geo,

235
00:15:40,431 --> 00:15:44,330
for example, leases out a very,
you know, it's a very basic phone,

236
00:15:44,331 --> 00:15:47,840
but it's kind of a smartphone for $23.
Uh,

237
00:15:47,890 --> 00:15:50,210
it's a three year lease for $23.

238
00:15:50,460 --> 00:15:54,160
You can buy a certain Chinese
and Indian made phones, um,

239
00:15:54,350 --> 00:15:58,670
for somewhere between 50 and $150.
Now at that price point,

240
00:15:58,671 --> 00:16:01,070
when you include all of these things,
it's irresistible.

241
00:16:01,810 --> 00:16:02,770
What are the,

242
00:16:03,070 --> 00:16:08,070
the kind of gaps that you talk about the
smart phone being able to bridges the

243
00:16:08,410 --> 00:16:12,730
urban rural gap, but also kind of the
linguistic gap to your point earlier,

244
00:16:13,090 --> 00:16:15,070
the mobile phone is primarily been,
um,

245
00:16:15,220 --> 00:16:20,020
or the smart phone and PC before that was
primarily targeted an English speaking

246
00:16:20,021 --> 00:16:22,060
audience. And that's,
that started to change.

247
00:16:22,090 --> 00:16:24,530
I think one of the stories that
really illustrates that is, uh,

248
00:16:24,730 --> 00:16:28,740
the story of a uphill who started this
education app. But tell us about that.

249
00:16:29,250 --> 00:16:31,410
Sure. Um, so, uh,

250
00:16:31,470 --> 00:16:35,230
I have a chapter on education
and one of the, the,

251
00:16:35,231 --> 00:16:39,630
the people that I profile in that chapter,
his name is Abdullah. Why here? Then he,

252
00:16:39,690 --> 00:16:42,850
uh, he's a real sort of fixer
upper of a character. Uh,

253
00:16:43,170 --> 00:16:47,340
didn't go to an English school growing up,
so he never really spoke English well.

254
00:16:47,341 --> 00:16:50,730
And, you know, in India to
succeed, uh, you, you know,

255
00:16:50,731 --> 00:16:54,510
speaking English is a
huge leg up. And, um,

256
00:16:54,570 --> 00:16:57,930
so he started using an
app called Hello English,

257
00:16:58,290 --> 00:17:02,350
which is one of India's top
educational apps. And, uh,

258
00:17:02,460 --> 00:17:07,050
the way hello English works is as long
as you speak some other Indian language,

259
00:17:07,051 --> 00:17:10,020
say Hindi,
and you can read the English alphabet,

260
00:17:10,290 --> 00:17:15,290
you're able to then play these games
that teach you or help you improve your

261
00:17:15,510 --> 00:17:19,650
conversational English. And so [inaudible]
was playing this game every day,

262
00:17:19,651 --> 00:17:22,380
sitting on the toilet seat,
sitting in traffic jams,

263
00:17:22,381 --> 00:17:24,270
and he got better and better and better.

264
00:17:24,270 --> 00:17:28,650
And he was ranked number one out
of millions of, of users worldwide.

265
00:17:28,651 --> 00:17:32,400
And so I found him and
sort of profiled him.

266
00:17:32,401 --> 00:17:37,401
And His story was amazing because
he essentially became a confident,

267
00:17:38,790 --> 00:17:41,700
a man and a confident teacher.

268
00:17:41,701 --> 00:17:46,260
He runs a coaching institute in
Rajasthan through not only hello English,

269
00:17:46,261 --> 00:17:50,580
this app, because he couldn't afford,
was that a stone going to a school?

270
00:17:51,240 --> 00:17:55,350
Um, but he also became
a, you know, through,

271
00:17:55,410 --> 00:18:00,410
through youtube and watching videos of
motivational speakers and stuff like

272
00:18:00,601 --> 00:18:04,790
that. He just was able to become
a very confident educator. And,

273
00:18:04,860 --> 00:18:08,040
and that struck me as, as you
know, the kind of thing that,

274
00:18:08,630 --> 00:18:12,700
that it's hard to quantify
nationally. Like there's no, you know,

275
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:16,980
metric to look at those kinds of
intangible improvements in people's lives.

276
00:18:17,340 --> 00:18:20,250
But also in that chapter, um, uh,

277
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:23,240
I also looked at learning outcomes for,

278
00:18:23,241 --> 00:18:27,960
for children because I think if you look
at the biggest space for disruption in

279
00:18:27,961 --> 00:18:31,590
India really is early childhood education.
Um,

280
00:18:31,650 --> 00:18:35,220
and the reason is that, you know,
India has opened a lot of schools,

281
00:18:35,250 --> 00:18:39,440
but the schools don't always train
people in the right way. Uh, and they're,

282
00:18:39,450 --> 00:18:44,450
all of these studies that show that
learning outcomes for children was greatly

283
00:18:45,091 --> 00:18:47,010
reduced after the age of Seven,
eight,

284
00:18:47,400 --> 00:18:51,900
which meant that the reason why they were
dropping off and math and literacy is

285
00:18:52,110 --> 00:18:55,050
because frankly they couldn't read,
they couldn't read and write,

286
00:18:55,051 --> 00:18:57,150
and so they weren't able
to progress further.

287
00:18:57,660 --> 00:19:01,200
And there's a lot of research now and
there are many Ngo's that are working in

288
00:19:01,201 --> 00:19:01,771
this space,

289
00:19:01,771 --> 00:19:06,771
but the phone is really come through
as a tool that could allow people to,

290
00:19:07,650 --> 00:19:12,540
uh, improve their basic numeracy and
literacy, uh, at the lowest levels,

291
00:19:12,750 --> 00:19:16,080
which would really work at a
mass way to Indians advantage.

292
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:20,870
I wanted to kind of take a step back and
kind of think about some of the macro

293
00:19:20,871 --> 00:19:25,871
trends that have enabled a lot of the
evolutions that you discuss in the book.

294
00:19:26,120 --> 00:19:26,953
Um,

295
00:19:27,170 --> 00:19:31,460
it strikes me with the kind of analogy
of the automobile that it required a

296
00:19:31,461 --> 00:19:36,461
robust partnership between the state and
private companies to get that right and

297
00:19:36,980 --> 00:19:40,620
kind of the state knowing when to
lean in and when to lean back. Um,

298
00:19:40,670 --> 00:19:43,040
at the end of the book,
you actually do a really good job of,

299
00:19:43,970 --> 00:19:47,240
of framing up that narrative
and the context of the,

300
00:19:47,241 --> 00:19:49,100
of mobile phones in India.

301
00:19:49,550 --> 00:19:52,640
There's like an Indian
American businessmen who has
a conversation with Roger,

302
00:19:52,641 --> 00:19:57,620
have gone the, uh, to kind of really pave
the way to bring, um, telephones to India,

303
00:19:57,650 --> 00:20:02,210
which was a luxury as late
as a, as the early 1980s. Um,

304
00:20:02,360 --> 00:20:04,700
we'd love for you to kind of
talk about that evolution,

305
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:07,090
particularly with an eye towards what is,

306
00:20:07,110 --> 00:20:11,000
what is the right way that kind of
private forces and public institutions can

307
00:20:11,001 --> 00:20:16,001
work together to really take advantage
and bring to fruition the potential of

308
00:20:16,310 --> 00:20:17,450
these new technologies.

309
00:20:18,760 --> 00:20:19,240
You know,

310
00:20:19,240 --> 00:20:24,240
the telephony in India has mostly
been a private sector story.

311
00:20:25,360 --> 00:20:30,040
So the public sector story was what you
were describing of the 60 seventies,

312
00:20:30,820 --> 00:20:35,820
early eighties of the state trying to
get basic telephone landlines to people.

313
00:20:36,131 --> 00:20:39,340
And that was something that
the state largely failed at.

314
00:20:39,790 --> 00:20:44,740
And one innovation that really worked
for the state was when they opened what

315
00:20:44,741 --> 00:20:48,880
was known as these STD, PCO, boots.

316
00:20:49,180 --> 00:20:52,360
And these were basically,
um, telephone boots,

317
00:20:52,600 --> 00:20:57,600
but they were manned by shopkeepers or
a seven 11 mom and pop store owners.

318
00:20:58,820 --> 00:20:59,140
Uh,

319
00:20:59,140 --> 00:21:04,140
they're basically at marketplaces
and you would go in and you could,

320
00:21:04,510 --> 00:21:08,110
uh, uh, you know, pay for a metered call,

321
00:21:08,390 --> 00:21:11,290
a local or international
as the case would be.

322
00:21:11,560 --> 00:21:15,820
And that allowed many people to get
access to telephony in a way that they

323
00:21:15,821 --> 00:21:20,400
wouldn't have otherwise. But you
know, in terms of mobile telephony,

324
00:21:20,410 --> 00:21:25,090
when the state first, uh,
began to sort of, uh, you know,

325
00:21:25,091 --> 00:21:28,720
open up and that sense, uh,
they, there were still many,

326
00:21:28,721 --> 00:21:33,700
many restrictions for the private
sector and it was through sheer, um,

327
00:21:33,940 --> 00:21:36,010
sort of, uh, you know,

328
00:21:36,011 --> 00:21:39,780
force of will in the form of the
private sector that, you know,

329
00:21:39,820 --> 00:21:43,460
three g and four g finally
took off in India. Um,

330
00:21:43,510 --> 00:21:48,070
basically through advertising and offers
from the private sector that allowed it

331
00:21:48,071 --> 00:21:53,050
to reach Indians in a mass way. And then
the second wave was through hardware.

332
00:21:53,051 --> 00:21:57,190
So, you know, the, the handsets
and, and cheaper smartphones,

333
00:21:57,370 --> 00:22:01,300
all of which are led by the
private sector in India. Um,

334
00:22:01,630 --> 00:22:04,980
I think the space we're at now is,
you know,

335
00:22:05,070 --> 00:22:09,310
the government has largely seeded a lot
of this space to the private sector,

336
00:22:09,311 --> 00:22:12,870
but I think where the government
could be very important, uh,

337
00:22:13,150 --> 00:22:16,990
and where the private sector could
work closely with the government, uh,

338
00:22:16,991 --> 00:22:21,760
on his is regulation in terms of, you
know, how to regulate this market,

339
00:22:21,790 --> 00:22:24,250
how to regulate the
entrance of new players,

340
00:22:24,251 --> 00:22:27,940
how to regulate foreign
players versus Indian players.

341
00:22:28,360 --> 00:22:33,250
But then the second thing that is very
important to me and is really a large

342
00:22:33,251 --> 00:22:35,350
part of the book as well,
is to,

343
00:22:35,570 --> 00:22:39,010
to sort of deal with some
of the adverse effects of,

344
00:22:39,070 --> 00:22:44,070
of the smartphone boom in India and those
range from addictions to fake news to

345
00:22:45,491 --> 00:22:48,940
pornography and two,

346
00:22:49,030 --> 00:22:51,790
and we can get into some
more detail on those topics.

347
00:22:51,790 --> 00:22:56,200
But just to use the analogy with the car,
once again,

348
00:22:56,740 --> 00:23:00,980
you know, governments around the
world and the private sector, uh,

349
00:23:01,180 --> 00:23:04,020
partnered on cars,
um,

350
00:23:04,360 --> 00:23:06,210
with advertising basically in,

351
00:23:06,211 --> 00:23:11,211
in terms of telling people that the
car is clearly a tool for immense good,

352
00:23:11,920 --> 00:23:14,260
but it is also a weapon
of mass destruction.

353
00:23:14,261 --> 00:23:17,110
So you need to not drink and drive,

354
00:23:17,350 --> 00:23:19,960
you need to wear seatbelts
when you're driving.

355
00:23:20,380 --> 00:23:25,210
And those were public interest campaigns
that were very important I think for

356
00:23:25,211 --> 00:23:26,530
societies around the world.

357
00:23:26,560 --> 00:23:31,560
And I've begun to see smartphones is
something quite similar to the car in that

358
00:23:31,781 --> 00:23:33,700
respect, where, you know,

359
00:23:33,730 --> 00:23:38,290
smartphones and technology can also
be immensely destructive to societies,

360
00:23:38,291 --> 00:23:41,620
especially a society like
India, which is, you know,

361
00:23:41,621 --> 00:23:45,800
still so nascent and gullible
and so many ways. Um,

362
00:23:45,890 --> 00:23:47,510
but superstitions in,
in,

363
00:23:47,511 --> 00:23:52,511
in various communities and the notion
of being able to see this device as

364
00:23:53,391 --> 00:23:58,391
something that has immense potential
for good but also for bad and what to do

365
00:23:58,791 --> 00:24:01,400
with that and how to deal
with that is very important.

366
00:24:01,401 --> 00:24:05,990
And I think that's a space that uh, public
and private can really cooperate on.

367
00:24:06,160 --> 00:24:06,371
Yeah,

368
00:24:06,371 --> 00:24:09,850
I think that's a great segue into what
I'd love for us to unpack a little bit

369
00:24:09,851 --> 00:24:11,890
more. Um, the,

370
00:24:12,190 --> 00:24:14,830
the first part of the book is very
much about the opportunities of the

371
00:24:14,831 --> 00:24:18,060
smartphone revolution in
education and healthcare and um,

372
00:24:18,190 --> 00:24:19,840
empowering women all across the country.

373
00:24:19,841 --> 00:24:24,310
I think the second part is when
you talk about some of, uh,

374
00:24:24,370 --> 00:24:28,780
some of the potentially
negative consequences and
you talk about the story of a

375
00:24:28,781 --> 00:24:30,630
shake, a Halim, uh,

376
00:24:30,631 --> 00:24:35,290
and the lynching that took place that
was more or less driven by communication

377
00:24:35,291 --> 00:24:39,430
messaging apps. Um, talk, talk
to me a little bit about that.

378
00:24:39,431 --> 00:24:43,150
And this is really me putting my
Google news initiative hat on. Um,

379
00:24:43,660 --> 00:24:47,710
the evolution of misinformation,
deep synthetic media, misinformation,

380
00:24:47,860 --> 00:24:49,750
how you see that playing out in,

381
00:24:49,880 --> 00:24:54,880
in India and the role and responsibility
that you feel, um, platforms,

382
00:24:55,120 --> 00:24:58,150
uh, should, uh, should
take in addressing that.

383
00:24:58,760 --> 00:25:00,350
Sure. So, uh, you know,

384
00:25:00,351 --> 00:25:04,730
many of you have heard the stories of
lynchings that have taken place in India,

385
00:25:04,970 --> 00:25:08,150
Hindu, Muslim related
violence, mob violence,

386
00:25:08,480 --> 00:25:13,480
and much of this tends to stem from the
proliferation of fake news on Messaging

387
00:25:15,680 --> 00:25:18,710
Apps, specifically whatsapp,
which is very popular in India,

388
00:25:18,920 --> 00:25:21,440
but also other messaging apps in India.

389
00:25:21,740 --> 00:25:26,740
I hesitate to put the blame squarely at
the place of messaging apps because it

390
00:25:27,351 --> 00:25:30,650
is not as if rumors didn't spread before.

391
00:25:30,651 --> 00:25:34,730
It is not as if there were not lynchings
and mob violence before technology.

392
00:25:35,270 --> 00:25:39,320
Technology has just allowed for the
spread of these things faster and quicker

393
00:25:40,130 --> 00:25:43,200
than was possible before.
Um,

394
00:25:43,640 --> 00:25:48,640
what often happens is that people in
India are often not equipped in the same

395
00:25:50,331 --> 00:25:54,830
way to decipher and deal with fake
news as people may be in the West.

396
00:25:55,340 --> 00:25:59,690
And think of it this way. I mean, when
you all first started using the Internet,

397
00:26:00,110 --> 00:26:01,670
that saying the late nineties,

398
00:26:01,970 --> 00:26:06,140
you had a hotmail account and you would
get a chain mail and the chain May,

399
00:26:06,141 --> 00:26:09,740
I would say, if you don't forward this
to 15 people, you'll be unlucky in love.

400
00:26:09,740 --> 00:26:11,390
And you're laughing there.
I mean,

401
00:26:11,391 --> 00:26:15,590
many of you have probably hit forward and
sent it to 15 people until a friend or

402
00:26:15,591 --> 00:26:18,980
two says, Hey, this is stupid. Don't
do that. And then you don't do that.

403
00:26:19,400 --> 00:26:21,280
But remember when I was talking about the,

404
00:26:21,290 --> 00:26:24,500
the West's evolution
versus India's revolution.

405
00:26:24,501 --> 00:26:29,300
So you all have evolved with the Internet
and you've evolved with your mistakes

406
00:26:29,301 --> 00:26:32,210
and you've learned not to
make those mistakes over time.

407
00:26:32,211 --> 00:26:37,070
So you are now more discerning consumers
of the Internet and our fake news,

408
00:26:37,071 --> 00:26:41,810
and you're better able to
judge, you know, what is true,

409
00:26:41,811 --> 00:26:45,570
what is false, what smells right,
what to forward, what not to.

410
00:26:46,500 --> 00:26:49,860
Um, that's less so of the
case in India because again,

411
00:26:49,890 --> 00:26:54,570
hundreds of millions of people are
discovering the Internet right now on

412
00:26:54,720 --> 00:26:59,640
smartphones and they haven't built
the same nose for fake news. Um,

413
00:26:59,910 --> 00:27:03,600
add to the fact that they are,
you know, not as privileged,

414
00:27:03,601 --> 00:27:06,160
they don't have the same
levels of education. Um,

415
00:27:06,330 --> 00:27:09,330
they don't have the same levels
of media literacy necessarily.

416
00:27:10,140 --> 00:27:15,120
And um, very societies in India were
quite superstitious to begin with.

417
00:27:15,121 --> 00:27:19,500
So you take all of those things together
with the power of social media to

418
00:27:19,501 --> 00:27:24,501
amplify in a viral fashion and you
have a cocktail that's quite dangerous.

419
00:27:25,150 --> 00:27:29,340
Um, it's a huge challenge for, I
think, tech companies to figure out,

420
00:27:29,341 --> 00:27:32,220
but also society to figure out
and the government to figure out.

421
00:27:32,640 --> 00:27:35,510
And as I was saying
earlier, I think, you know,

422
00:27:35,520 --> 00:27:39,360
media literacy would be something
that I think tech companies,

423
00:27:39,361 --> 00:27:44,361
if they can play a part
in helping communities
understand the basics of how to

424
00:27:44,761 --> 00:27:48,780
decipher what is news, you know,
you know, who's funding it,

425
00:27:48,810 --> 00:27:51,710
what's the dateline, is it written
by a human being? You know,

426
00:27:51,711 --> 00:27:54,480
is it from a wire service? What is it? Um,

427
00:27:54,690 --> 00:27:58,740
and then also just the basic pitfalls of
what happens when you forward something

428
00:27:58,770 --> 00:28:03,330
basic. You know, how this
can be exponential, you know,
how to trust, how to verify.

429
00:28:03,750 --> 00:28:04,620
That's very important.

430
00:28:04,621 --> 00:28:08,670
It's a conversation that has just
begun to take place in India. Um,

431
00:28:08,700 --> 00:28:10,770
but you know,
as a journalist,

432
00:28:10,771 --> 00:28:13,200
I can tell you where the elections
around the corner in India,

433
00:28:13,500 --> 00:28:15,300
this is an issue of grave concern.

434
00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:19,860
A lot of things could go wrong before
Indian society figures out how to get it

435
00:28:19,861 --> 00:28:20,270
right.

436
00:28:20,270 --> 00:28:22,100
Yeah. And it's a, as you will know,

437
00:28:22,101 --> 00:28:24,950
it's supposed to be quite the challenge
here in the states. So absolutely.

438
00:28:24,951 --> 00:28:25,940
I imagine it's even,

439
00:28:26,090 --> 00:28:30,320
it's even more even greater in India
on the same vein of like some of the

440
00:28:30,321 --> 00:28:34,600
potential pitfalls of the smartphone
revolution. One of the parts of that,

441
00:28:34,601 --> 00:28:37,940
one of the chapters that
really kind of shocked me,

442
00:28:37,941 --> 00:28:42,530
it was like entirely news to me. Um,
concerns, just broadly a conversation on,

443
00:28:42,531 --> 00:28:46,640
on sexuality and how it
shows up, uh, online. Um,

444
00:28:46,670 --> 00:28:51,670
but you talk about kind of the advent of
very violent pornography and how that's

445
00:28:51,981 --> 00:28:55,040
become readily accessible to,
um,

446
00:28:55,340 --> 00:28:59,140
to hundreds of millions of
people, uh, in, in India. Um,

447
00:28:59,150 --> 00:29:03,920
and you don't necessarily draw a direct
causal relationship between that and the

448
00:29:03,921 --> 00:29:08,620
horrific, um, crimes that we've
seen in the last few years. Uh,

449
00:29:08,750 --> 00:29:10,190
in India.
Uh,

450
00:29:10,191 --> 00:29:13,850
but you do kind of allude to the fact
that there is something there that's worth

451
00:29:13,910 --> 00:29:17,450
exploring based off of kind
of exploring that story,

452
00:29:17,750 --> 00:29:22,250
do you feel like tech platforms have a
responsibility to curb or curtail that

453
00:29:22,251 --> 00:29:23,084
sort of content?

454
00:29:24,140 --> 00:29:27,440
This is a tough question because, um, I,

455
00:29:27,530 --> 00:29:31,520
the last thing I would ever want
to advocate is curtailing, uh,

456
00:29:31,521 --> 00:29:32,780
are censoring content.

457
00:29:33,500 --> 00:29:38,500
And yet pornography is one of those
things where you have to wonder,

458
00:29:38,960 --> 00:29:43,210
are people properly sensitized, deal with
it. And the reason why I say this is,

459
00:29:43,540 --> 00:29:43,811
look,

460
00:29:43,811 --> 00:29:47,530
growing up in the west is so different
from growing up in a village in India.

461
00:29:47,860 --> 00:29:52,660
If you grow up here, you were sensitized
at a young age to the human body.

462
00:29:52,661 --> 00:29:55,900
I mean, you go to the beach, you
see, you know, if you're a young boy,

463
00:29:55,901 --> 00:30:00,250
you see a woman's legs at a very young
age. And you know, you talk about sex,

464
00:30:00,251 --> 00:30:04,450
you go to coed schools, you have a
healthier relationship with sexuality.

465
00:30:04,890 --> 00:30:09,400
Um, if you are a young boy in
rural India, you may have a very,

466
00:30:09,430 --> 00:30:13,330
very different relationship with the
human body, with sexuality, with sex.

467
00:30:13,870 --> 00:30:16,600
Um,
given that backdrop,

468
00:30:16,630 --> 00:30:21,630
if your first experience of sexuality
is violent pornography and add to that,

469
00:30:24,251 --> 00:30:27,850
the fact that this is not something
you can talk about with your family.

470
00:30:28,060 --> 00:30:30,580
This is not something you
can talk about at school.

471
00:30:30,790 --> 00:30:33,280
Do you have no way of deciphering
it and interpreting it?

472
00:30:33,820 --> 00:30:37,690
There are real problems with that.
And you know, as a journalist, again,

473
00:30:37,691 --> 00:30:41,450
when I was reporting in India,
one of the things that, uh,

474
00:30:41,650 --> 00:30:46,540
the worst stories that I often had to
cover were very violent gang rapes,

475
00:30:46,780 --> 00:30:49,870
um, and other types of
rape across the country.

476
00:30:50,860 --> 00:30:54,640
And it was a deeply, deeply disturbing
thing to cover. And on the one hand,

477
00:30:54,641 --> 00:30:58,180
of course, rape happens everywhere.
This is not uniquely a problem, uh,

478
00:30:58,190 --> 00:31:01,150
unique to India.
It's not unique to any country,

479
00:31:01,780 --> 00:31:03,520
but it did get me wondering,
you know,

480
00:31:03,521 --> 00:31:07,540
is there a connection between
this explosion in pornography,

481
00:31:07,810 --> 00:31:11,920
this explosion and access to
pornography? Because again, you know,

482
00:31:11,921 --> 00:31:15,550
if you were a teenager in America of 10,
15 years ago,

483
00:31:15,580 --> 00:31:19,450
you could hide a playboy
magazine under your mattress. Um,

484
00:31:19,600 --> 00:31:21,430
for most Indians that was not an option.

485
00:31:21,431 --> 00:31:24,520
The unit privacy works very
differently in India. Um,

486
00:31:24,521 --> 00:31:26,650
access works very different
than you don't grow up.

487
00:31:26,680 --> 00:31:29,380
Most Indians didn't grow up with a,
uh,

488
00:31:29,480 --> 00:31:32,950
a TV and a VCR or a DVD player.

489
00:31:33,370 --> 00:31:35,560
So the Internet changes everything.

490
00:31:35,561 --> 00:31:38,680
A private viewing device
changes everything.

491
00:31:39,370 --> 00:31:42,850
And I do wonder quite opening the
book whether there is a link between

492
00:31:42,851 --> 00:31:46,780
pornography and rape, whether
there is a link between, um,

493
00:31:46,840 --> 00:31:51,790
porn and, uh, you know, sexuality
in India. And I don't have answers.

494
00:31:51,791 --> 00:31:54,430
I mean this is where I have to
be honest in that, you know,

495
00:31:54,431 --> 00:31:58,840
a lot of the data shows that,
um, there may not be a link. Um,

496
00:31:59,140 --> 00:32:03,010
but, but I sort of closed
that chapter, you know,

497
00:32:03,011 --> 00:32:04,600
just very much in two minds.

498
00:32:04,600 --> 00:32:09,600
And I think this is a conversation and a
debate that I think needs to take place

499
00:32:10,150 --> 00:32:12,760
more widely in India
in a very open fashion.

500
00:32:13,390 --> 00:32:17,380
And the reason why I say this again
is that sex and sexuality, uh,

501
00:32:18,070 --> 00:32:21,010
you know,
is not new to India.

502
00:32:21,011 --> 00:32:24,700
If you go back 500 years,
a thousand years,

503
00:32:24,880 --> 00:32:29,880
you think again of the Kama Sutra and
think of temples in India that really

504
00:32:29,981 --> 00:32:32,860
enshrined sex and sexuality.
Um,

505
00:32:33,130 --> 00:32:36,880
so notions of openness about
sex should not be new to India,

506
00:32:37,150 --> 00:32:42,150
but a notion of sort of prudishness was
introduced into Indian society through

507
00:32:42,470 --> 00:32:47,240
colonization and, and you know, it was
more of a Victorian import, uh, you know,

508
00:32:47,241 --> 00:32:50,780
think of the flowers and the
petticoat and the, you know,

509
00:32:50,990 --> 00:32:54,620
so many things that, that didn't
even exist in India before that.

510
00:32:54,980 --> 00:32:58,430
So it's, the water's a,
uh, quite muddied on this.

511
00:32:58,431 --> 00:33:01,880
But I do think it's an issue that
that needs to be debated openly.

512
00:33:02,550 --> 00:33:04,440
I wanted to pivot a little bit,
um,

513
00:33:04,590 --> 00:33:09,300
to kind of the relationship between or
the role of the state and in some of

514
00:33:09,301 --> 00:33:11,100
these technologies. Um, you,

515
00:33:11,190 --> 00:33:16,020
you kind of talk very compellingly
about the fact that India is the world's

516
00:33:16,021 --> 00:33:19,800
leader in digital blackouts
and specifically most of
that takes place in the

517
00:33:19,801 --> 00:33:20,730
state of Kashmir.

518
00:33:21,260 --> 00:33:25,380
And then you also kind of talk about
some of these very digital forward

519
00:33:25,381 --> 00:33:26,910
initiatives like other,
for example,

520
00:33:26,911 --> 00:33:31,911
which of sound incredible in terms of
their potential if we can get it right.

521
00:33:32,041 --> 00:33:32,570
But,
um,

522
00:33:32,570 --> 00:33:37,410
there've been conversations around data
breach and privacy leaks from that. The,

523
00:33:37,440 --> 00:33:40,050
you know, it's the kind of theme
that percolates throughout the book.

524
00:33:40,051 --> 00:33:43,080
Like this is an incredible
technology that we should,

525
00:33:43,081 --> 00:33:46,210
that can do all these
incredible things and uh,

526
00:33:46,220 --> 00:33:51,120
and really addressing and
solving real problems for a
lot of people. Uh, but when,

527
00:33:51,280 --> 00:33:55,380
but we have to be careful about
like the state's role. Um,

528
00:33:55,860 --> 00:34:00,860
and particularly trusting a state with
data and privacy would be great to get

529
00:34:02,550 --> 00:34:06,920
your sense of, do you, I mean,
having written the book now, like,

530
00:34:06,930 --> 00:34:11,930
do you feel like the state in India is
equipped to properly manage and handle

531
00:34:12,630 --> 00:34:17,630
this data in a way that ensures that
we get the better end of the potential?

532
00:34:19,240 --> 00:34:21,190
I don't know, is the
honest answer. I mean,

533
00:34:21,191 --> 00:34:25,120
what we do know is that everyone
needs checks and balances,

534
00:34:25,121 --> 00:34:30,040
including the state, including big
corporations. So, for example, um,

535
00:34:30,250 --> 00:34:32,620
uh, if you haven't read this yet, um,

536
00:34:32,680 --> 00:34:37,630
India has more internet shutdowns
than any other country on earth. Uh,

537
00:34:37,690 --> 00:34:39,430
Syria and Iraq are two and three.

538
00:34:39,970 --> 00:34:43,240
And what this means is
that at any given moment,

539
00:34:43,540 --> 00:34:48,380
the state can just switch off the
internet. So it basically has, uh,

540
00:34:48,400 --> 00:34:52,840
the, the biggest mobile provides value to
providers on speed dial and it can call

541
00:34:52,841 --> 00:34:56,260
them and say, all right, in this
particular area, shut down the Internet.

542
00:34:56,560 --> 00:35:00,740
This often happens in Kashmir officer
encounters with terrorists. Uh,

543
00:35:00,820 --> 00:35:04,990
and the reason, the logic is that,
again, to use the car analogy,

544
00:35:04,991 --> 00:35:06,790
if there's a car crash right outside here,

545
00:35:06,970 --> 00:35:08,980
the police would likely
cordon off the street.

546
00:35:09,370 --> 00:35:11,980
And so digitally speaking,

547
00:35:12,220 --> 00:35:16,210
if there is a clash between the
police and militants in Kashmir,

548
00:35:16,660 --> 00:35:20,980
um, the, the authorities would
shut off the Internet so that,

549
00:35:21,410 --> 00:35:24,790
uh, militants wouldn't
be able to, uh, you know,

550
00:35:24,791 --> 00:35:29,440
send out imagery on social media
or seek help or anything like that.

551
00:35:29,710 --> 00:35:34,450
Now on the one hand,
there's a clear a use for this,

552
00:35:34,720 --> 00:35:37,590
but on the other hand
there is immense misuse,

553
00:35:37,950 --> 00:35:41,240
especially if it isn't properly codified.
You know,

554
00:35:41,490 --> 00:35:45,090
under what circumstances is a
government allowed to impose a shutdown?

555
00:35:45,330 --> 00:35:48,420
Who makes the decision?
Is there any accountability?

556
00:35:48,690 --> 00:35:51,360
Is there any recourse if
a wrong decision was made?

557
00:35:51,600 --> 00:35:54,300
And then linked to all
of that is over time.

558
00:35:54,540 --> 00:35:57,360
So cushy the state of Kashmir for example,
um,

559
00:35:57,690 --> 00:36:02,010
it lost hundreds of millions of dollars
in lost business and this is according

560
00:36:02,011 --> 00:36:06,270
to a study by Brookings because the
Internet was shut down for months.

561
00:36:06,660 --> 00:36:10,680
So, uh, you know, those are
clear examples of the state.

562
00:36:11,070 --> 00:36:14,490
Um, you can call it overreaching,
you can call it, you know,

563
00:36:14,491 --> 00:36:18,750
taking a draconian approach to
dealing with a problem. But again,

564
00:36:19,380 --> 00:36:24,150
for all the good that the Internet and
the proliferation of smartphones can do

565
00:36:24,450 --> 00:36:25,740
in a place like India,

566
00:36:26,070 --> 00:36:31,070
there is so much grey area and so much
of sort of new areas of regulation that

567
00:36:31,401 --> 00:36:35,280
that haven't really been covered
or discussed in the public space.

568
00:36:35,280 --> 00:36:38,230
And Internet shutdowns
is chief among them. Um,

569
00:36:38,350 --> 00:36:42,150
[inaudible] is a very interesting
topic in and of itself. Um,

570
00:36:42,151 --> 00:36:43,950
for those of you don't know,
that's the,

571
00:36:44,220 --> 00:36:47,580
the biometric ID system in
India that has now signed up.

572
00:36:47,820 --> 00:36:51,600
I think it's about 1.2 billion people.
It's a,

573
00:36:51,601 --> 00:36:55,920
a system that basically
allows people to say, I am me.

574
00:36:55,921 --> 00:36:57,880
So it's an ID card,
uh,

575
00:36:57,900 --> 00:37:02,700
with fingerprints and retinal
scans included. And um,

576
00:37:03,570 --> 00:37:06,690
this is part of a very
polarized debate in India.

577
00:37:07,050 --> 00:37:12,050
There are people who will say that this
could have immense positive impacts in

578
00:37:12,271 --> 00:37:14,340
terms of, um, you know,

579
00:37:14,341 --> 00:37:18,200
people being able to have an an id
to open bank accounts to open it,

580
00:37:18,201 --> 00:37:22,230
to get cell phone lines to get subsidies
from the government, so on and so forth.

581
00:37:22,950 --> 00:37:27,620
But there are many who will also tell
you a critics who will say that, um,

582
00:37:27,870 --> 00:37:32,580
this could be misused by the state.
It could be, there could be leakages,

583
00:37:32,581 --> 00:37:35,890
there could be hacks. Uh, you
can't change your fingerprint.

584
00:37:35,891 --> 00:37:40,140
So once you lose them to someone else,
you're in trouble. So on and so forth.

585
00:37:40,410 --> 00:37:42,150
I tend to fall somewhere between,

586
00:37:42,240 --> 00:37:47,130
in the middle of that debate where I
think you can't deny that there is immense

587
00:37:47,131 --> 00:37:48,210
potential to this.

588
00:37:48,690 --> 00:37:53,460
And I think the government on the other
hand needs to address the critics and

589
00:37:53,461 --> 00:37:56,920
openly acknowledge that
there have been leaks. And,

590
00:37:56,930 --> 00:38:00,480
and this again is where the private
sector could, could help, uh,

591
00:38:00,481 --> 00:38:02,520
in terms of how to plug those leaves,

592
00:38:02,530 --> 00:38:07,530
how to have better security and how to
be more upfront about where things stand,

593
00:38:07,830 --> 00:38:11,340
better communication all around which
I think the private sector has immense

594
00:38:11,341 --> 00:38:12,510
experience with [inaudible].

595
00:38:13,140 --> 00:38:13,973
One of,
um,

596
00:38:14,070 --> 00:38:19,070
one of the striking chapters is on a
topic that folks who followed it in

597
00:38:19,111 --> 00:38:22,770
politics over the last couple of years
would be well aware of demonetization.

598
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:26,190
What's interesting about that particular
chapter was you kind of follow the

599
00:38:26,191 --> 00:38:30,540
story of this auto rickshaw driver and
kind of his journey through dealing with

600
00:38:30,541 --> 00:38:32,460
the aftermath of demonetization.

601
00:38:32,640 --> 00:38:37,030
There's a line around you wondered whether
or not he'd ever be able to learn how

602
00:38:37,031 --> 00:38:39,110
to use a smartphone and really,
um,

603
00:38:39,460 --> 00:38:43,390
really be able to join in this
increasingly digital economy.

604
00:38:44,110 --> 00:38:49,110
What responsibility do you think society
in tech companies have for those who in

605
00:38:49,511 --> 00:38:54,490
the short term or medium term, maybe even
long term, are being left behind by the,

606
00:38:54,580 --> 00:38:56,470
this increasing wave of digitization?

607
00:38:57,390 --> 00:39:01,360
So you can contrast fooled with the story.
With the story of the survey.

608
00:39:01,361 --> 00:39:03,270
She was an auto rickshaw driver.

609
00:39:03,570 --> 00:39:06,600
I met in Delhi and followed
around for two years now.

610
00:39:07,110 --> 00:39:11,720
And he knows deep down that he
just cannot use a smartphone.

611
00:39:11,820 --> 00:39:15,510
He can't bring himself to use a
smartphone, doesn't understand it,

612
00:39:15,660 --> 00:39:19,950
is very intimidated by technology that
can't even afford it to begin with.

613
00:39:20,310 --> 00:39:24,780
Um,
and the reason why that even came up is,

614
00:39:25,440 --> 00:39:29,220
um, during demonetization, which
for those of you don't know,

615
00:39:29,221 --> 00:39:33,360
it was a moment where the government
recalls the two highest currency

616
00:39:33,361 --> 00:39:35,490
denomination notes from the market,

617
00:39:35,491 --> 00:39:40,491
which was 86% of all cash and
replaced it with two other notes.

618
00:39:41,010 --> 00:39:45,690
The reason being that they wanted a to
get rid of so called black money in the

619
00:39:45,691 --> 00:39:48,820
system, which is money that hasn't, uh,

620
00:39:48,840 --> 00:39:53,700
on which income tax hasn't been paid
and be to move India towards digital

621
00:39:53,701 --> 00:39:57,450
payments. Um, but in that chaotic moment,

622
00:39:57,451 --> 00:40:01,150
which most economists worth their
salt have decried as you know,

623
00:40:01,200 --> 00:40:06,200
a horrendous stupid decision which has
cost India as much as 2% of its GDP.

624
00:40:06,840 --> 00:40:11,130
But in that chaotic moment, many
people suffered for their livelihoods,

625
00:40:11,131 --> 00:40:15,900
including surveys. This auto rickshaw
driver because all of his, his, uh,

626
00:40:15,901 --> 00:40:19,770
rides were paid for in cash and
because people didn't have cash,

627
00:40:19,980 --> 00:40:22,620
he wasn't making any money.
So he was really struggling.

628
00:40:22,621 --> 00:40:27,510
And in that moment when I was interviewing
him for CNN, I asked him, well, hey,

629
00:40:27,750 --> 00:40:31,250
why don't you use Uber? Uh,
why don't you sign up for Ola,

630
00:40:31,350 --> 00:40:34,620
which is Uber is Indian
equivalent and competitor.

631
00:40:35,040 --> 00:40:39,770
And that's where it all came up. He just
was very intimidated by technology. Um,

632
00:40:39,840 --> 00:40:44,190
didn't have a smartphone and felt
like this was just not for him. And,

633
00:40:44,880 --> 00:40:47,310
and I contrast that story with food,

634
00:40:47,311 --> 00:40:52,260
with these because it's one thing
for us to think of technology as,

635
00:40:52,500 --> 00:40:54,840
you know,
if you just build it and people will come,

636
00:40:55,320 --> 00:40:57,510
that's not necessarily going to happen,

637
00:40:57,540 --> 00:41:02,540
especially in places like India where
there so many barriers and think of not

638
00:41:02,821 --> 00:41:04,800
just people like survey shoe young,

639
00:41:04,890 --> 00:41:09,450
I mean he's in his twenties and
should really be able to learn.

640
00:41:09,600 --> 00:41:14,040
Um, the think of older people in
India. India has about, you know,

641
00:41:14,041 --> 00:41:18,150
250 million people who are
over the age of 55, 60.

642
00:41:18,151 --> 00:41:22,020
And for those people,
technology is very intimidating.

643
00:41:22,021 --> 00:41:26,130
It's very hard to just be
given a smartphone and then
learn how to use it and

644
00:41:26,131 --> 00:41:29,720
learn how to communicate and
learn how to use apps. So, um,

645
00:41:30,240 --> 00:41:34,190
that space was very important
for me to explore as well. It's,

646
00:41:34,220 --> 00:41:35,390
it's sort of a,

647
00:41:35,440 --> 00:41:39,410
a counterpoint to the narrative that
tech is necessarily going to transform

648
00:41:39,411 --> 00:41:43,250
India, not as much as tech
will transform. India.

649
00:41:43,251 --> 00:41:47,580
I think India will also transform
tech. I think, you know, there,

650
00:41:47,581 --> 00:41:50,870
there India has all these unique
ways of dealing with tech. You know,

651
00:41:50,871 --> 00:41:52,890
Indians are still,
uh,

652
00:41:52,930 --> 00:41:56,830
much more comfortable with cash than
they are with digital payments. Uh,

653
00:41:56,840 --> 00:42:00,920
Indians preferred you Wilson phones over
single sim phones because they like to

654
00:42:00,921 --> 00:42:02,720
switch between service providers.

655
00:42:03,260 --> 00:42:08,260
Indians prefer prepaid Saturday to
contracts instead of postpaid because they

656
00:42:08,271 --> 00:42:11,900
don't trust large companies to give
them good service. Not only that,

657
00:42:12,320 --> 00:42:14,750
large companies don't trust
them to pay up on time,

658
00:42:14,751 --> 00:42:19,700
so they prefer prepaid options as well.
So for all of those reasons,

659
00:42:19,940 --> 00:42:23,260
India is just a unique market.
Um,

660
00:42:23,830 --> 00:42:28,020
and a very large market
that I think, uh, is,

661
00:42:28,030 --> 00:42:32,210
is going to evolve.
And change and its own very special ways.

662
00:42:32,850 --> 00:42:37,050
And um, my last question before
we open it up for Q and. A. Um,

663
00:42:37,590 --> 00:42:40,510
so given that,
given how unique India is and,

664
00:42:40,520 --> 00:42:44,250
and the reality is that we've
unpacked here, uh, so far,

665
00:42:44,640 --> 00:42:49,640
let's say hypothetically
you were a product manager
overseeing android or you're

666
00:42:50,341 --> 00:42:54,990
in charge of building out products
for the next billion users in India.

667
00:42:55,340 --> 00:42:55,740
Um,

668
00:42:55,740 --> 00:42:59,640
what are some of the things that you'd
keep in mind or that you would feel are,

669
00:42:59,670 --> 00:43:04,500
uh, are considerations that would be
front and center and how you approached,

670
00:43:04,710 --> 00:43:07,920
um, rolling out those products and
those sorts of products that you built?

671
00:43:08,910 --> 00:43:13,380
That's a great question.
Uh, I'm sure Google is doing
all of these things already,

672
00:43:13,381 --> 00:43:16,650
but I would,
if I was a product manager,

673
00:43:16,770 --> 00:43:19,920
I would bring on board people
like salvation food. But the,

674
00:43:19,921 --> 00:43:22,950
I would bring on board
people who are not literate,

675
00:43:22,980 --> 00:43:27,980
people who have never used any technology
before and see what kinds of problems

676
00:43:28,921 --> 00:43:30,840
they're encountering. A, I would,

677
00:43:31,110 --> 00:43:35,370
the English market in India is
already very well served. Um,

678
00:43:35,520 --> 00:43:39,360
it's the Indian language market
in the Bengali, Tamil Telugu.

679
00:43:39,361 --> 00:43:42,120
So on and so forth that
is still underserved.

680
00:43:42,600 --> 00:43:46,920
And I would explore how those
users engage with the Internet,

681
00:43:47,130 --> 00:43:49,050
what they need,
uh,

682
00:43:49,080 --> 00:43:53,310
what they're struggling with
and then links to all of that.

683
00:43:54,180 --> 00:43:57,630
I would really focus on digital
literacy and media literacy.

684
00:43:58,080 --> 00:44:03,080
I think there is with the great power
that companies like Google have in places

685
00:44:05,611 --> 00:44:10,611
like India comes a responsibility
I believe to help people
navigate things that

686
00:44:13,350 --> 00:44:17,820
could do immense good but can do
immense harm as well. And so, you know,

687
00:44:18,690 --> 00:44:23,610
stepping in where the state has failed,
you know, to help people understand,

688
00:44:24,030 --> 00:44:28,920
you know, to learn how to engage
with news, to learn what is right,

689
00:44:28,980 --> 00:44:33,900
what is wrong, to verify,
um, to build that,

690
00:44:34,440 --> 00:44:39,360
you know, that inner sense of, uh,

691
00:44:40,140 --> 00:44:42,770
that, that aptitude of being
able to gauge, you know,

692
00:44:42,780 --> 00:44:44,190
what is real and what is fake.

693
00:44:44,790 --> 00:44:48,180
That will be one of the great
challenges for Indian society.

694
00:44:48,181 --> 00:44:52,740
And if I was able to do that,
um, as a product manager,

695
00:44:52,741 --> 00:44:55,980
I think that's one of the things I would
spend a lot of time thinking about.

696
00:44:56,430 --> 00:45:01,430
And I think whoever is able to fix that
in the private sector would have done an

697
00:45:01,561 --> 00:45:05,250
immense,
immense service to a place like India.

698
00:45:05,280 --> 00:45:06,570
Because you know,

699
00:45:06,750 --> 00:45:10,770
India doesn't have to repeat
the mistakes of the west India.

700
00:45:11,160 --> 00:45:16,160
India's path could be different through
technology and we all talk about the

701
00:45:16,441 --> 00:45:20,340
word leap frog. Uh, and India
will leapfrog in many ways.

702
00:45:20,341 --> 00:45:23,730
It will leap frog credit
cards. It will leap frog, uh,

703
00:45:23,850 --> 00:45:27,570
so many different things that
the west has evolved through.

704
00:45:27,900 --> 00:45:30,510
But leapfrog isn't
necessarily a good thing.

705
00:45:31,020 --> 00:45:33,420
You can leap frog to a bad place as well.

706
00:45:33,660 --> 00:45:38,490
That's where I think the private sector
can really help with and sort of speed

707
00:45:38,491 --> 00:45:43,491
up that learning process and not assume
that that learning processes already in

708
00:45:44,011 --> 00:45:44,844
place

709
00:45:45,580 --> 00:45:49,790
shouldn't be long. Open it up for
audience questions. There are two mikes.

710
00:45:49,791 --> 00:45:54,791
Just wonder and wonder if
folks want to start queuing up.

711
00:45:57,390 --> 00:45:59,700
First of all, thank you.
Very, very interesting talk.

712
00:46:01,020 --> 00:46:04,890
I think throughout this talk, most
of the, or even or even completely,

713
00:46:05,020 --> 00:46:08,550
we've contrasted India with,
with the West,

714
00:46:08,780 --> 00:46:13,200
the United States specifically.
And, uh, um, you know,

715
00:46:13,201 --> 00:46:14,580
there are some ways where,
you know,

716
00:46:14,581 --> 00:46:18,930
we share similar problems when one thing
went obvious thing that we did talk

717
00:46:18,931 --> 00:46:21,930
about was um, uh, sexual content online.

718
00:46:22,470 --> 00:46:24,360
I think even in the United States,
uh,

719
00:46:24,390 --> 00:46:28,470
the availability of problematic content
online far outpaces the availability of

720
00:46:28,471 --> 00:46:32,520
good sexual education in most of this
country. Okay. It's just as an example.

721
00:46:32,521 --> 00:46:35,120
So I am wondering what, um, uh,

722
00:46:35,190 --> 00:46:39,330
what lessons have you learned from your
exploration of how India got connected,

723
00:46:39,720 --> 00:46:42,660
uh, that might apply to
the United States as well?

724
00:46:43,550 --> 00:46:45,710
Wow. So the other way around. Um,

725
00:46:46,850 --> 00:46:49,160
well that's a great question.
Um,

726
00:46:49,610 --> 00:46:52,790
I think because India is discovered
all of these things later,

727
00:46:53,030 --> 00:46:57,920
it is sort of learning from the
West's mistakes as it goes along.

728
00:46:58,220 --> 00:47:02,180
But in terms of lessons from India,
um,

729
00:47:02,900 --> 00:47:07,100
you know,
one takeaway I think would be that

730
00:47:09,230 --> 00:47:13,700
cultures use technology in ways
that are very unique to them.

731
00:47:14,180 --> 00:47:17,420
And I think, especially for, um,

732
00:47:19,580 --> 00:47:23,720
for investors here, you know, anyone who's
dealing with products that are global,

733
00:47:24,170 --> 00:47:28,550
I think it's very important to
see each culture, each community,

734
00:47:28,551 --> 00:47:33,551
each as having very unique ways
of dealing with technology.

735
00:47:35,260 --> 00:47:40,060
And so for example, the, when
I was talking about cash, um,

736
00:47:41,170 --> 00:47:45,520
you know, Indians, Indians, what I
like to call a very low trust society.

737
00:47:46,230 --> 00:47:46,690
And,

738
00:47:46,690 --> 00:47:51,220
and that's because Indians almost always
just assume that anything that could go

739
00:47:51,221 --> 00:47:53,860
wrong in the system will go wrong.
Uh,

740
00:47:53,861 --> 00:47:56,890
Indians don't show up for meetings on
time because they don't expect the other

741
00:47:56,891 --> 00:47:58,990
person to show up on time.
Uh,

742
00:47:59,010 --> 00:48:03,250
Indians like to pay for things in cash
because they think something could go

743
00:48:03,251 --> 00:48:06,610
wrong with a credit
card. Um, so, you know,

744
00:48:06,790 --> 00:48:09,590
cash on delivery is a very
big thing in India. Um, uh,

745
00:48:09,620 --> 00:48:11,260
Amazon's big competitor in India,

746
00:48:11,261 --> 00:48:16,261
Flipkart began as a company that was
delivering books to people and then those

747
00:48:17,531 --> 00:48:21,370
customers would pay for it in
cash at their doorsteps. Um,

748
00:48:21,430 --> 00:48:25,870
and the reason why I'm explaining
this as a lesson for America is that,

749
00:48:26,560 --> 00:48:28,900
um,
you know,

750
00:48:31,230 --> 00:48:33,300
each market will develop in its own way.

751
00:48:33,301 --> 00:48:38,160
And will have its own sort of unique
relationship with how technology develops

752
00:48:38,161 --> 00:48:42,970
and how it should be
used. Um, that said, uh,

753
00:48:43,020 --> 00:48:48,020
I wish I could tell you that India for
all of its great connections with faith

754
00:48:49,261 --> 00:48:52,350
and religion, you know, India was
the birthplace of for religions.

755
00:48:52,351 --> 00:48:53,910
It was the birthplace of yoga.

756
00:48:54,240 --> 00:48:59,240
I wish I could tell you that Indians have
a better relationship with screens and

757
00:48:59,341 --> 00:49:03,270
they don't, uh, I think
uh, addictions as much as,

758
00:49:03,510 --> 00:49:06,330
as much as it screen addiction
as a problem here in the west.

759
00:49:06,600 --> 00:49:10,590
It is becoming so in India.
And so in that sense, uh,

760
00:49:10,890 --> 00:49:14,610
India really has no lessons
to offer. Uh, and, and the,

761
00:49:14,620 --> 00:49:17,370
the solution to that problem
would have to be a global one.

762
00:49:18,090 --> 00:49:18,923
Thank you.

763
00:49:21,120 --> 00:49:24,570
Hi Robin. Thanks for joining us and
sharing your thoughts, aren't you?

764
00:49:24,571 --> 00:49:29,250
To go a little bit more into that,
you briefly mentioned regulation,

765
00:49:29,460 --> 00:49:33,930
regulation of technology and the
foreign was this Indian company dynamic.

766
00:49:34,350 --> 00:49:38,670
And I've seen many a stories recently
about the common wanting to change how

767
00:49:38,671 --> 00:49:42,720
things are and the status quo of things
like their localization, stuff like that.

768
00:49:42,721 --> 00:49:46,860
So I just wanted to hear your thoughts
on how things look right now and what you

769
00:49:46,861 --> 00:49:48,090
think will happen in the future.

770
00:49:48,091 --> 00:49:52,260
Like is India going to become another
China in terms of foreign companies not

771
00:49:52,261 --> 00:49:54,810
being able to play on the same level?

772
00:49:55,700 --> 00:49:55,941
I mean,

773
00:49:55,941 --> 00:50:00,941
I don't think India can become another
China and I don't think even the

774
00:50:01,081 --> 00:50:05,280
government wants to do that. China's just
such a different market to begin with.

775
00:50:05,281 --> 00:50:09,750
Uh, their Internet is, you
know, almost like one language.

776
00:50:09,780 --> 00:50:14,670
They have apps that are, as you all know,
an entire ecosystem in and of itself.

777
00:50:15,150 --> 00:50:18,930
India's evolution with the Internet has
been so different. Number one, you know,

778
00:50:18,931 --> 00:50:23,040
India has more than 200 million
English language users. Um,

779
00:50:24,010 --> 00:50:25,650
right from the start.
Uh,

780
00:50:25,680 --> 00:50:30,680
Western companies were allowed in and
became the leaders of the Indian internet,

781
00:50:31,560 --> 00:50:33,080
Google being first among them,

782
00:50:33,380 --> 00:50:38,380
but also Amazon and Uber and so many
other companies that made it big in India

783
00:50:38,720 --> 00:50:39,553
quite early.

784
00:50:39,950 --> 00:50:44,870
I think what you're seeing now more
recently in terms of regulation is,

785
00:50:45,380 --> 00:50:49,570
is India and this
government's reaction to, um,

786
00:50:50,690 --> 00:50:54,020
Western companies having such
a large slice of the pie.

787
00:50:54,650 --> 00:50:59,150
And so for example, in the
ecommerce space, you know,

788
00:50:59,200 --> 00:51:02,210
if the Indian government is restricting,
uh,

789
00:51:02,330 --> 00:51:06,860
the amount that Western companies can
own and accompany or the amount of

790
00:51:06,861 --> 00:51:08,930
business that they can
do in a certain space,

791
00:51:09,200 --> 00:51:13,910
I think they're doing that primarily just
to protect local companies from being

792
00:51:13,911 --> 00:51:16,790
able to survive and stay in the game.
Uh,

793
00:51:16,820 --> 00:51:21,820
I don't think it will ever rise to the
levels of either China or even sort of

794
00:51:23,361 --> 00:51:27,860
the protectionism that we
saw in India in the 80s. Um,

795
00:51:27,890 --> 00:51:29,000
because India,

796
00:51:29,540 --> 00:51:33,830
I think one of the things you
must see about India is that,

797
00:51:34,820 --> 00:51:37,470
you know, every politician, uh,

798
00:51:37,580 --> 00:51:41,870
every regulator looks
to 1991 as the urine,

799
00:51:41,871 --> 00:51:45,980
which the Indian economy really opened
up and benefited from opening up.

800
00:51:46,400 --> 00:51:50,310
I just cannot see India
going back on that. Uh,

801
00:51:50,350 --> 00:51:55,310
I cannot see even this government, uh,
you know, stepping back on that front,

802
00:51:55,311 --> 00:52:00,020
I think they realize that, uh, opening
up is where, where their strength lies.

803
00:52:00,320 --> 00:52:03,530
Uh, and I think they also realized
that the market isn't static.

804
00:52:03,531 --> 00:52:06,710
It's growing so fast that there's
enough space for everyone.

805
00:52:10,520 --> 00:52:14,240
Thanks for being here.
I remained largely ignorant of India.

806
00:52:14,270 --> 00:52:17,660
Short of some stories from Maroon about
his personal travels before this talk.

807
00:52:18,080 --> 00:52:19,730
And I'm very interested in,

808
00:52:19,790 --> 00:52:23,040
you mentioned the way that India
will change technology. Um,

809
00:52:23,360 --> 00:52:28,280
is there infrastructure in place
for, uh, either developers in India,

810
00:52:28,281 --> 00:52:32,810
are phone makers in India to really
learn at scale how to build better

811
00:52:32,811 --> 00:52:36,650
technology for those that are
often overlooked in the west, um,

812
00:52:36,770 --> 00:52:41,060
poor people beyond just the cost of phone
and sort of reducing access to entry,

813
00:52:41,300 --> 00:52:43,550
actually building technology that serves,
you know,

814
00:52:43,551 --> 00:52:45,730
at the APP level or one layer further.
Um,

815
00:52:45,890 --> 00:52:49,310
some of those more rural and
offering separated populations?

816
00:52:49,880 --> 00:52:51,800
Yeah, there is, that's a great question.

817
00:52:51,801 --> 00:52:55,400
I think most of it is led by
the private sector again, um,

818
00:52:55,430 --> 00:52:59,250
if you look at, um, so I,

819
00:52:59,260 --> 00:53:02,210
I coming back to education,
I talk about uh,

820
00:53:02,570 --> 00:53:06,680
an Indian company and my chapter on
education, it's called aches step,

821
00:53:06,681 --> 00:53:10,830
which means one step and
they have developed, um,

822
00:53:10,970 --> 00:53:15,800
essentially they like to think
of themselves as, you know,

823
00:53:15,830 --> 00:53:16,401
for example,

824
00:53:16,401 --> 00:53:20,840
the Uber of primary education where
they've created a platform where other

825
00:53:20,841 --> 00:53:25,040
developers can jump in and
create multilingual content.

826
00:53:25,320 --> 00:53:29,130
For primary schoolers are primary school
teachers to be able to use for their

827
00:53:29,131 --> 00:53:29,964
students.

828
00:53:30,450 --> 00:53:35,130
And it really is a great
example of sort of,

829
00:53:35,190 --> 00:53:39,330
you know, Indian tech developers
using their technologies.

830
00:53:39,331 --> 00:53:41,790
And this was inspired by odd Har.
Uh,

831
00:53:41,791 --> 00:53:46,770
so it's sort of an open stack kind of
system that allows other companies to

832
00:53:46,771 --> 00:53:50,430
create other things around it.
I think of all the heart itself,

833
00:53:50,431 --> 00:53:54,600
the biometric ID system, which
is Indian, it's indigenous,

834
00:53:54,960 --> 00:53:58,980
uh, it's Indian run Indian engineers. Um,

835
00:53:59,100 --> 00:54:02,840
and this was the government's initiative,
but it was led by you know,

836
00:54:02,850 --> 00:54:06,480
private sector, techie a none the Nilekani
for those of you who don't know him,

837
00:54:06,900 --> 00:54:10,170
uh, who found cofounded
emphasis. Um, but again,

838
00:54:10,171 --> 00:54:12,870
the basic logic being that,
uh,

839
00:54:12,871 --> 00:54:16,720
you can harness Indian strengths
and Indian workers, uh,

840
00:54:16,770 --> 00:54:18,770
to create these open platforms,

841
00:54:18,771 --> 00:54:23,100
systems that could then plug
into other aspects, you know,

842
00:54:23,101 --> 00:54:26,660
it could plug into the banking
sector, it can plug in to, uh,

843
00:54:26,790 --> 00:54:29,340
the government subsidy schemes
and so on and so forth.

844
00:54:29,730 --> 00:54:33,900
So I think that space is where
most of the innovation is taking,

845
00:54:33,990 --> 00:54:38,970
taking place. Um, more than any
other space, I would say. Uh,

846
00:54:39,360 --> 00:54:43,470
you know, if, if you look at other
spaces like search or messaging,

847
00:54:43,710 --> 00:54:47,550
I would argue that the most innovation
is taking place in the west or maybe in

848
00:54:47,551 --> 00:54:51,510
China and India is development
on that front is more derivative.

849
00:54:52,470 --> 00:54:56,670
My question was more towards the future.
So if you look at India right now, uh,

850
00:54:56,810 --> 00:54:57,250
it has,

851
00:54:57,250 --> 00:55:00,310
the country is totally not for you to
share the highest or a large fraction of

852
00:55:00,311 --> 00:55:01,770
the population living

853
00:55:03,380 --> 00:55:08,380
in rural and rural blizzardous
up and out at the vast.

854
00:55:08,880 --> 00:55:11,100
Okay. Talking about it in
the next decade or two,

855
00:55:11,101 --> 00:55:15,270
how are say hydrogen intelligence,
we'll check with jobs. Uh,

856
00:55:15,330 --> 00:55:20,330
and I would still assume that maybe a
showing orthorexia could be as profitable

857
00:55:20,521 --> 00:55:23,210
as a self driving car for a company
that wants to make it. Yeah.

858
00:55:23,340 --> 00:55:26,670
So do you have any thoughts about what,
uh,

859
00:55:26,880 --> 00:55:30,480
how a country like India that a suit
behind in terms of technology and in terms

860
00:55:30,481 --> 00:55:31,314
of,

861
00:55:31,610 --> 00:55:35,640
in this industrial exesion would be
affected a say 20 years down the line?

862
00:55:37,090 --> 00:55:41,180
It's a great question. Uh, and I try to
deal with this a little bit in the book.

863
00:55:41,810 --> 00:55:45,470
So there are two things going
on. On the one hand, um,

864
00:55:45,530 --> 00:55:50,000
the rise of smartphones will
lead in the immediate future,

865
00:55:50,001 --> 00:55:51,770
I think to immense job creation.

866
00:55:52,250 --> 00:55:55,010
So if you think of the ecommerce market,

867
00:55:55,011 --> 00:55:58,910
which is going to grow leaps
and bounds in India, um,

868
00:55:59,810 --> 00:56:04,810
the kinds of jobs that you create with
the ecommerce market are ideally suited

869
00:56:04,971 --> 00:56:08,960
to the Indian labor profiles.
So you've got delivery jobs,

870
00:56:08,961 --> 00:56:11,300
you've got packing jobs,
warehousing jobs.

871
00:56:11,630 --> 00:56:16,630
Those are exactly the kinds of jobs
that rural Indian men mostly are exactly

872
00:56:17,301 --> 00:56:21,390
primed for a, they don't
need more education. Uh,

873
00:56:21,440 --> 00:56:23,150
those are the kinds of
jobs they're looking.

874
00:56:23,380 --> 00:56:27,600
They're relatively well paid for
what they're looking for. Uh,

875
00:56:27,700 --> 00:56:32,320
so there are enough studies out there
that show that those kinds of jobs will

876
00:56:32,321 --> 00:56:36,790
create, you know, tens of
millions of jobs over the next 10,

877
00:56:36,791 --> 00:56:40,960
15 years. That's sort of the
shorter term perspective.

878
00:56:40,961 --> 00:56:45,170
And then there are many other stories
of, you know, like there's an Indian, uh,

879
00:56:45,280 --> 00:56:48,970
version of Linkedin for blue collar
workers. It's called Baba jobs,

880
00:56:49,210 --> 00:56:53,500
which was then bought over by quicker.
And basically it sort of connects people,

881
00:56:53,890 --> 00:56:58,630
uh, who are seeking a certain type of
job to that particular type of employer.

882
00:56:58,920 --> 00:57:03,730
You know, if you're a Domino's pizza
and India for example, um, you know,

883
00:57:03,731 --> 00:57:05,350
you are looking for delivery man,

884
00:57:07,000 --> 00:57:11,020
the standards for selecting a
delivery man is, are pretty low.

885
00:57:11,021 --> 00:57:13,930
Like if you show up for the job interview,
you're going to get the job.

886
00:57:14,260 --> 00:57:17,950
So the real challenge there is
connecting the secret to the employer and

887
00:57:17,951 --> 00:57:22,270
technology will fix a lot of those issues.
So in the short term,

888
00:57:22,271 --> 00:57:24,340
I think there's an immense benefits.

889
00:57:24,640 --> 00:57:29,170
The longer term is where the
troubles come around, uh, as, um,

890
00:57:29,500 --> 00:57:34,500
these giant warehouses get automated
as deliveries get automated as,

891
00:57:34,630 --> 00:57:38,110
uh, cars get automated. The thing is,

892
00:57:38,380 --> 00:57:41,920
it's hard for me to imagine those
things happening in India the way I can

893
00:57:41,921 --> 00:57:44,390
imagine them happening in the West.
See,

894
00:57:44,400 --> 00:57:49,400
it's one thing to imagine a
drone delivering a package to,

895
00:57:51,010 --> 00:57:51,280
you know,

896
00:57:51,280 --> 00:57:55,600
this giant house in Pasadena where it
just drops it off in the garden delivery

897
00:57:55,601 --> 00:57:56,434
done.

898
00:57:56,590 --> 00:58:01,590
But can you imagine the same drone
delivering the same product to a slum in

899
00:58:01,751 --> 00:58:03,730
Mumbai where,
you know,

900
00:58:03,731 --> 00:58:08,110
you're trying to hover over this tiny
shack and they're like 200 children

901
00:58:08,111 --> 00:58:11,470
playing around there and then
one of them grabs the package,

902
00:58:11,650 --> 00:58:14,140
someone else grabs the
drone and know that,

903
00:58:14,141 --> 00:58:16,990
that that's the end of
the model right there. Um,

904
00:58:17,770 --> 00:58:21,280
it's hard also to imagine, um, you know,

905
00:58:21,281 --> 00:58:25,120
the algorithm that would
work for, uh, you know,

906
00:58:25,121 --> 00:58:28,180
automated driving in India.
I used to drive in India and you know,

907
00:58:28,181 --> 00:58:31,870
you're navigating not just roads and cars,
but you're navigating people in cows,

908
00:58:32,230 --> 00:58:36,760
you know, so, and other animals
and it's hard to imagine,

909
00:58:36,790 --> 00:58:40,120
uh, automation really working, uh,

910
00:58:40,121 --> 00:58:45,121
in these tiny narrow lanes where
it takes immense on ingenuity,

911
00:58:45,660 --> 00:58:49,630
you know, just scream and shout and
corral support for your car to get out.

912
00:58:50,510 --> 00:58:52,600
So on the one hand,

913
00:58:52,601 --> 00:58:57,310
I think when these things eventually
get automated in India, um,

914
00:58:57,760 --> 00:59:01,810
you know, we will see immense
job losses. I just, I,

915
00:59:01,811 --> 00:59:05,980
I can't bring myself around to seeing
that moment. I can't imagine it.

916
00:59:05,981 --> 00:59:10,000
I don't know if you guys can Google, but
it's, India is a very different market.

917
00:59:10,510 --> 00:59:10,721
Yeah.

918
00:59:10,721 --> 00:59:14,050
And it speaks to our responsibility to
kind of be thoughtful about some of those

919
00:59:14,051 --> 00:59:18,220
consequences before they really manifest.
Or last audience question.

920
00:59:18,940 --> 00:59:22,090
Thanks for coming. Thank
you. You mentioned a couple

921
00:59:22,110 --> 00:59:25,320
times about the biometric ID system.
Um,

922
00:59:25,460 --> 00:59:28,460
but you also mentioned that
and he has a low trust society.

923
00:59:28,910 --> 00:59:33,910
Has there been any worry or discussion
about adopting some of what the Chinese

924
00:59:34,011 --> 00:59:36,910
government does is doing?
Using the vitamins are consistent?

925
00:59:37,020 --> 00:59:41,250
There has been a, I think the debate
has been restricted mostly to, uh,

926
00:59:41,760 --> 00:59:46,760
sort of more elite policy circles and
amongst journalists and civil society.

927
00:59:48,360 --> 00:59:50,730
And I don't imagine that,
you know,

928
00:59:50,731 --> 00:59:54,240
out of the 1.2 billion people
who've signed up, you know,

929
00:59:54,270 --> 00:59:58,560
I would imagine the vast majority haven't
really thought too much about privacy.

930
00:59:58,800 --> 01:00:01,540
And you have to think again of
where they're coming from. Uh,

931
01:00:01,650 --> 01:00:05,520
most have come from a place where they
had no form of id or driver's license,

932
01:00:05,670 --> 01:00:09,630
certainly no passport,
um, no way of getting, uh,

933
01:00:09,730 --> 01:00:12,240
access to government
subsidies or products.

934
01:00:12,570 --> 01:00:16,620
So this was a big leap and it was
a useful lead for many people.

935
01:00:16,950 --> 01:00:19,320
And despite being a low trust society,

936
01:00:19,321 --> 01:00:24,321
it's very telling that they were able to
invest so much trust in the government

937
01:00:24,510 --> 01:00:27,210
in the hope of something better.
Um,

938
01:00:28,110 --> 01:00:32,010
and that speaks to the potential for
technology in India and how much,

939
01:00:32,370 --> 01:00:36,150
how much hope people have
for what technology could
do and how it could better

940
01:00:36,151 --> 01:00:40,050
their lives. But as I was saying
earlier that there are many,

941
01:00:40,051 --> 01:00:44,700
many things that could go wrong and,
and that is a debate that needs to be had.

942
01:00:44,730 --> 01:00:49,440
It is, uh, something that the government
needs to be more open, uh, about,

943
01:00:49,860 --> 01:00:53,700
uh, there certainly have been
massive leaks and you know,

944
01:00:53,701 --> 01:00:57,300
fessing up to them nice and early
and being transparent would serve the

945
01:00:57,301 --> 01:01:00,000
government. Well, I mean the,
you know, everything has leaks.

946
01:01:00,010 --> 01:01:04,920
It's owning up to them and dealing with
them that eventually we'll win people's

947
01:01:04,921 --> 01:01:08,940
trust I think. So that's a longer
journey for India. Sorry, go ahead.

948
01:01:09,080 --> 01:01:10,400
Yeah.
So just to clarify.

949
01:01:10,401 --> 01:01:14,870
So overall it's been very beneficial
and the risks are like what are the more

950
01:01:14,871 --> 01:01:15,890
immediate risks if not

951
01:01:16,280 --> 01:01:17,630
for odd Har?
Yeah,

952
01:01:18,700 --> 01:01:22,870
I think the immediate risks are a,

953
01:01:23,210 --> 01:01:24,043
uh,

954
01:01:24,370 --> 01:01:29,370
large scale leaks be the information
from those leaks being harnessed in ways

955
01:01:33,011 --> 01:01:36,320
that are particularly insidious. So, um,

956
01:01:36,430 --> 01:01:41,140
it could be voter fraud,
it could be a impersonation,

957
01:01:41,200 --> 01:01:44,410
it could be opening fake accounts.
Um,

958
01:01:44,560 --> 01:01:49,560
there's a range of things that one could
see happening based on leaked biometric

959
01:01:51,551 --> 01:01:52,384
ids.

960
01:01:52,600 --> 01:01:57,600
All of that said one advantage
of this system is that a,

961
01:01:59,771 --> 01:02:04,300
it is a government controlling it,
not a company and B,

962
01:02:04,330 --> 01:02:08,320
it is data that is fairly dumb.
I mean it is your id,

963
01:02:08,560 --> 01:02:12,260
but it doesn't have your browsing
history. It doesn't have your, uh,

964
01:02:12,340 --> 01:02:17,110
I sort of preferences. It's hard to sell
that to an ad firm and see, you know,

965
01:02:17,111 --> 01:02:22,080
it's, it's not an immense value to
someone else, uh, in the way that,

966
01:02:22,540 --> 01:02:26,940
uh, other leaks that we've seen from,
from other companies could be. Um,

967
01:02:27,060 --> 01:02:30,870
Facebook sneaks for example, to
came Cambridge Analytica. Um,

968
01:02:31,050 --> 01:02:33,900
so in that sense,
I think the potential for odd,

969
01:02:33,901 --> 01:02:38,190
hard to be dangerous is less so than,
uh,

970
01:02:38,191 --> 01:02:42,570
other leaks that we now know
about, um, from the private sector.

971
01:02:43,230 --> 01:02:47,430
All of that sad, um, one
shouldn't dismiss, uh,

972
01:02:47,460 --> 01:02:52,170
the what, what could go wrong
with that higher. And I think, um,

973
01:02:52,320 --> 01:02:53,580
you know, it's, again,

974
01:02:53,581 --> 01:02:58,170
it's a conversation that needs to be
had more openly and robustly in India.

975
01:02:58,680 --> 01:02:59,610
Thank you all for being here.

976
01:03:00,290 --> 01:03:00,920
Thank you so much.
