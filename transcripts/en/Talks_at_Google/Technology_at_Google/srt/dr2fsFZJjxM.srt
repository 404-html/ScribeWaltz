1
00:00:06,110 --> 00:00:11,110
It is my great pleasure to introduce
you guys to the USA for UN HCR.

2
00:00:13,610 --> 00:00:18,610
This is a group that has
supported refugees through
their partnerships with uh,

3
00:00:20,360 --> 00:00:23,860
you went high council on refugees and
the partners of the UN High Council and

4
00:00:23,870 --> 00:00:28,700
refugees.
They work diligently to provide support,

5
00:00:29,060 --> 00:00:30,290
food,
shelter,

6
00:00:30,530 --> 00:00:34,130
water safety and protection
to displace people.

7
00:00:34,790 --> 00:00:38,720
And to tell you a little bit more
about the group and project hive,

8
00:00:38,750 --> 00:00:43,750
which by the way was one of fast
company's 2017 most innovative companies.

9
00:00:45,230 --> 00:00:49,670
So we are in,
we are in store for a treat today.

10
00:00:50,060 --> 00:00:53,090
Um, without any further
ado, she only, she coulda,

11
00:00:53,091 --> 00:00:57,200
who is the major gifts manager
for USA for you. And HCR.

12
00:01:00,290 --> 00:01:04,970
Thank you so much for having us here
today. We're really excited to be here,

13
00:01:04,971 --> 00:01:09,080
especially given Google's partnership,
which we'll talk about in a moment. Um,

14
00:01:09,380 --> 00:01:12,920
but I just wanted to let you know,
first off,

15
00:01:12,921 --> 00:01:15,470
of course we have a Hashtag,
um,

16
00:01:15,471 --> 00:01:19,400
and that's Google talk refugees and you
can find us on Twitter at UN refugee

17
00:01:19,401 --> 00:01:23,990
agency. So if you feel so inclined,
please do give us a shout out online.

18
00:01:25,490 --> 00:01:30,440
Um, so we're going to be talking about the
global refugee crisis, um, to start out.

19
00:01:30,441 --> 00:01:34,280
And then I'm going to talk about the
work of the UN refugee agency and USA for

20
00:01:34,281 --> 00:01:38,900
you and HCR. And this is going to be
followed by a presentation of the hive,

21
00:01:38,901 --> 00:01:43,850
which is a special projects unit of USA
for you and HCR and what they're doing

22
00:01:43,851 --> 00:01:48,280
to unlock a larger American audience
to further the work that we do. Um,

23
00:01:48,290 --> 00:01:51,170
and then my colleague Nick is going to
talk about Google's partnership and then

24
00:01:51,171 --> 00:01:53,840
we'll also have time at
the end for questions.

25
00:01:56,260 --> 00:01:59,950
So just to start off, I don't know
if you've heard the latest numbers,

26
00:01:59,951 --> 00:02:04,951
but over 67 million people have
been displaced because a of,

27
00:02:05,080 --> 00:02:07,540
of violence,
conflict and persecution,

28
00:02:07,900 --> 00:02:10,870
this is an unprecedented
level of global displacement,

29
00:02:10,871 --> 00:02:12,850
the largest since World War II.

30
00:02:14,650 --> 00:02:14,970
Yeah.

31
00:02:14,970 --> 00:02:17,740
Um, and just to give you a sense
of the scale of the crisis,

32
00:02:17,741 --> 00:02:21,040
24 people around the world
are displaced every minute,

33
00:02:21,670 --> 00:02:24,820
which means by the time we're done
with this 45 minute presentation,

34
00:02:24,821 --> 00:02:29,230
about a thousand people would have been
forced to leave home. Um, and of course,

35
00:02:29,231 --> 00:02:33,640
behind all of these numbers are countless
stories of hardship, grief and loss,

36
00:02:33,641 --> 00:02:35,890
and just the struggle to rebuild lives.

37
00:02:39,720 --> 00:02:44,720
So these 67 million refugees
and internally displaced
people mainly come from 15

38
00:02:45,421 --> 00:02:50,070
active refugee emergencies. And here
you can see that on the map. Um,

39
00:02:50,110 --> 00:02:53,080
I'm sure a lot of you have heard
about the Syrian refugee crisis,

40
00:02:53,081 --> 00:02:56,250
so I'm not going to get too into
it, especially given Google's, um,

41
00:02:56,310 --> 00:02:59,710
work on the searching for Stereo website,
which if you haven't checked it out,

42
00:02:59,711 --> 00:03:01,990
I highly recommend it.
Um,

43
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:06,820
but there are 5 million refugees who
have been forced to leave Syria and 6

44
00:03:06,820 --> 00:03:10,070
million still displaced
within the country. Um,

45
00:03:10,150 --> 00:03:13,570
but today I'm going to talk about two
other refugee emergencies that aren't

46
00:03:13,571 --> 00:03:17,680
featured as prominently in the news.
And the first one, it's South Sudan.

47
00:03:18,610 --> 00:03:21,190
So since December of 2013,

48
00:03:21,191 --> 00:03:24,700
civil war has claimed the
lives of thousands of people.

49
00:03:25,150 --> 00:03:28,490
It's driven over 1.5
million refugees from,

50
00:03:28,540 --> 00:03:31,720
from the country and 1.9 within,

51
00:03:33,770 --> 00:03:36,320
um, in 2016, so last year,

52
00:03:36,321 --> 00:03:41,321
an average of 3000 people crossed South
Sudan's borders in one day and 67% of

53
00:03:42,951 --> 00:03:44,390
these refugees are children.

54
00:03:47,690 --> 00:03:50,720
So a combination of ongoing conflict,

55
00:03:50,721 --> 00:03:54,860
violence and trout have deprived the
farmers have the ability to grow and

56
00:03:54,861 --> 00:03:57,470
produce food.
And this is creating a manmade famine,

57
00:03:58,820 --> 00:04:03,820
100,000 people or an immediate danger
of death by starvation and underserved

58
00:04:04,461 --> 00:04:06,590
neighboring countries like the DRC,

59
00:04:06,860 --> 00:04:11,240
Uganda and Ethiopia are hosting these
refugees at an unsustainable rate.

60
00:04:11,480 --> 00:04:14,810
And this is creating Africa's
largest scale refugee crisis.

61
00:04:17,580 --> 00:04:18,360
Okay.

62
00:04:18,360 --> 00:04:18,690
Um,

63
00:04:18,690 --> 00:04:23,190
another often overshadowed crisis is
what's happening in the northern triangle

64
00:04:23,191 --> 00:04:27,210
of Central America right now. And
those countries consist of El Salvador,

65
00:04:27,211 --> 00:04:28,860
Honduras,
and Guatemala.

66
00:04:29,640 --> 00:04:34,440
And we're seeing a dramatic escalation
in violence by organized criminal gangs.

67
00:04:34,950 --> 00:04:35,880
And as a result,

68
00:04:35,881 --> 00:04:40,881
the number of refugees have increased
from 20 1020 12 to 146,020 16 and those

69
00:04:44,491 --> 00:04:46,830
numbers may not seem that large,

70
00:04:46,831 --> 00:04:50,520
but the fact that it's escalating so
quickly is a growing cause of concern.

71
00:04:53,740 --> 00:04:58,510
We're seeing increases in disappearances
forced recruitment into gangs,

72
00:04:58,511 --> 00:05:00,610
extortion,
and sexual violence.

73
00:05:01,210 --> 00:05:04,870
And among these growing numbers of
refugees are women and girls and

74
00:05:04,930 --> 00:05:07,090
unaccompanied and separated children,

75
00:05:07,720 --> 00:05:12,340
and they're particularly vulnerable
to protection risks such as human

76
00:05:12,341 --> 00:05:14,260
trafficking and sexual assaults.

77
00:05:18,770 --> 00:05:21,470
So what does the UN refugee agency do?

78
00:05:22,790 --> 00:05:27,790
So UNH CR is the world's
leading organization with
a mandate by the UN to aid

79
00:05:27,981 --> 00:05:30,140
and protect those who have
been forced to flee home.

80
00:05:30,590 --> 00:05:35,590
So there are about 11,000 UNHC
our employees and 128 countries.

81
00:05:36,350 --> 00:05:36,630
Um,

82
00:05:36,630 --> 00:05:41,630
and 90% of them are in the fields and
often remote and dangerous locations.

83
00:05:42,410 --> 00:05:47,410
And when an emergency strikes UNHC
archi mobilize aid within 72 hours.

84
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:52,040
And they've also helped over 50 million
refugees successfully restart their

85
00:05:52,041 --> 00:05:53,480
lives since 1950.

86
00:05:56,820 --> 00:05:58,140
So you're a quick chart of what

87
00:05:58,140 --> 00:05:59,340
you and HCR does.

88
00:05:59,341 --> 00:06:03,600
So the agency provides life
saving assistance like shelter,

89
00:06:04,260 --> 00:06:05,970
food,
water safety,

90
00:06:05,971 --> 00:06:10,260
but it also provides critical resources
that are necessary to rebuild lives.

91
00:06:10,261 --> 00:06:13,800
So cash assistance programs,
education,

92
00:06:14,010 --> 00:06:15,540
job in skills training.

93
00:06:20,260 --> 00:06:24,050
Um, USA for you in HCR is
the UN refugee agencies,

94
00:06:24,110 --> 00:06:29,110
national partner in the U S so we work
on raising awareness and funds to further

95
00:06:30,321 --> 00:06:34,650
UNHCRs work. So we provide
help, hope and home.

96
00:06:34,651 --> 00:06:37,700
So help in the way of
life saving assistance,

97
00:06:37,940 --> 00:06:42,940
hope in the form of job skills
training and ultimately home,

98
00:06:43,041 --> 00:06:46,940
whether it's in their original country
or in a different country like the u s

99
00:06:50,330 --> 00:06:53,090
and this is just how UNHCRs finance.

100
00:06:53,091 --> 00:06:55,490
So if you take a look at this
green segment right here,

101
00:06:55,491 --> 00:06:58,070
this is where USA for
you and HCR comes in.

102
00:06:58,490 --> 00:07:03,490
So we're one of the two
largest contributors of
private sector funding and our

103
00:07:03,981 --> 00:07:08,981
donors give anywhere from $30 to $3
million to further the mission of the UN

104
00:07:09,371 --> 00:07:10,204
HCR.

105
00:07:10,430 --> 00:07:15,430
And given the refugee crisis that I just
described and also the uncertainty of

106
00:07:15,981 --> 00:07:19,820
the rest of the pie, we're really
focused on growing the segment even more.

107
00:07:20,150 --> 00:07:23,360
And Erin done from the hive is going to
talk about one of the ways that we do

108
00:07:23,361 --> 00:07:24,194
just that.

109
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:27,340
Okay.

110
00:07:27,340 --> 00:07:28,990
Thank you.
Shyanne um,

111
00:07:29,020 --> 00:07:33,070
definitely having that background to
understand the crisis is really important.

112
00:07:33,370 --> 00:07:37,900
Um, but today I'm going to talk a little
bit more specifically about the United

113
00:07:37,900 --> 00:07:42,190
States and how we can really start to
support the refugee crisis more. Um,

114
00:07:42,191 --> 00:07:44,410
so to start,
I'm going to ask you guys all a question.

115
00:07:45,250 --> 00:07:50,250
What percent of the US public do you
guys think donate to humanitarian causes?

116
00:07:54,730 --> 00:07:59,230
60%. Anybody else? 20%.

117
00:07:59,770 --> 00:08:04,420
2% 2%. Ooh, anybody else? Well, 2%.

118
00:08:04,421 --> 00:08:07,900
It was probably the closest. Um, and
some of you guys might be surprised.

119
00:08:08,140 --> 00:08:12,400
Only 6% of, uh, of, of the
American public donate team,

120
00:08:12,401 --> 00:08:14,770
Ma humanitarian causes.
Um,

121
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:18,490
even for somebody like me that's been
working in this space for years was pretty

122
00:08:18,491 --> 00:08:19,690
shocked by that number.

123
00:08:20,230 --> 00:08:23,020
But when we started to look closer
at the number we discovered,

124
00:08:23,021 --> 00:08:24,820
there's probably a reason for this.

125
00:08:25,060 --> 00:08:29,890
And a lot of it is because all the big
NGOs like us and other ones like UNICEF

126
00:08:29,891 --> 00:08:30,880
and save the children,

127
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:35,860
we're all competing after that same 6%
because we know that those people are

128
00:08:35,861 --> 00:08:37,780
ripe and ready to take action.

129
00:08:38,380 --> 00:08:43,380
So we want it to look at how do we
expand that 6% how do we go out to these

130
00:08:43,751 --> 00:08:44,530
people that aren't,

131
00:08:44,530 --> 00:08:49,530
aren't engaged at all in humanitarian
causes and try to get them to activate.

132
00:08:50,260 --> 00:08:53,950
We knew it wasn't going to just be
throwing more money at more advertising

133
00:08:53,980 --> 00:08:58,590
targeting that same percent. We needed
real data science and innovation.

134
00:08:59,090 --> 00:08:59,923
Hm.

135
00:09:00,570 --> 00:09:03,900
So UNHCRs started asking
these three main questions.

136
00:09:04,260 --> 00:09:06,470
Now you and HCR is pretty.
Um,

137
00:09:06,690 --> 00:09:10,680
it's pretty good when it
comes to marketing in Europe
and other markets and they

138
00:09:10,681 --> 00:09:13,830
have a really strong support there.
But as we all know,

139
00:09:13,831 --> 00:09:16,200
the United States is a
totally different ballgame.

140
00:09:16,230 --> 00:09:18,450
So we had to approach it differently.

141
00:09:20,920 --> 00:09:22,420
So in 2014,

142
00:09:22,450 --> 00:09:26,050
UNHC are and USA from
Unh cr called the hive,

143
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:31,320
which is a special project
trying to unlock a larger
audience here in the United

144
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:32,433
States.

145
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:37,030
We set up the hive here in New York
and we hired some of the brightest and

146
00:09:37,031 --> 00:09:39,190
smartest people from
different backgrounds,

147
00:09:39,520 --> 00:09:43,330
from politics or from the private sector.

148
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:47,380
We wanted everybody that could look at
this problem in a completely different

149
00:09:47,381 --> 00:09:50,230
way.
And when we first started the hive,

150
00:09:50,260 --> 00:09:53,740
we did a lot of testing and yes,
we failed a few times,

151
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:57,420
but a lot of times we found out
some pretty awesome stuff. Um,

152
00:09:57,480 --> 00:10:01,000
a few of which we'll go
over a little bit later. Um,

153
00:10:01,030 --> 00:10:05,020
but the hive was really set up
to have data as our backbone. Um,

154
00:10:05,100 --> 00:10:09,160
so we built a data model and we use
that to infuse into a number of our

155
00:10:09,161 --> 00:10:12,610
campaigns so we could
reach beyond that 6%.

156
00:10:13,240 --> 00:10:17,500
Now our strategy has changed a little
bit over time. When we first started,

157
00:10:17,560 --> 00:10:19,960
nobody was talking about
the refugee crisis.

158
00:10:20,350 --> 00:10:23,920
So our goal was just to get people
in the u s to start talking more.

159
00:10:24,490 --> 00:10:28,420
But in 2015, as you guys
may know, things changed,

160
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:33,220
the crisis hit Europe and a little
boy washed up on a beach and suddenly

161
00:10:33,430 --> 00:10:37,660
everybody was talking about refugees.
Things have shifted even more,

162
00:10:37,810 --> 00:10:40,030
as more terrorist attacks have hit Europe.

163
00:10:40,060 --> 00:10:43,990
And often that conversation
sadly goes towards refugees.

164
00:10:44,230 --> 00:10:47,200
So instead of just getting
people to talk about refugees,

165
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:49,420
we're trying to change the conversation,

166
00:10:49,720 --> 00:10:53,740
we're trying to close that otherness
gap and help Americans relate more to

167
00:10:53,741 --> 00:10:56,920
refugees because after all,
they're just like us.

168
00:10:57,430 --> 00:11:01,210
So the hive is powered by data science,
innovative technology,

169
00:11:01,240 --> 00:11:06,010
creative campaigns and
strategic partnerships. Oh.

170
00:11:06,100 --> 00:11:06,950
And uh,

171
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:11,320
this year we were recently featured as
one of fast company's most innovative

172
00:11:11,410 --> 00:11:14,980
NGOs.
And as I mentioned earlier,

173
00:11:14,981 --> 00:11:18,580
the backbone of this operation
is really on data science.

174
00:11:18,610 --> 00:11:21,820
So I'm going to hand it off to my
colleague Rita Co who heads up our data

175
00:11:21,821 --> 00:11:22,654
strategy.

176
00:11:24,460 --> 00:11:28,000
Thank you Erin. Um, it's such a
pleasure to be here today guys.

177
00:11:28,780 --> 00:11:32,410
Thank you for taking time out of
your day. Uh, so data science,

178
00:11:32,411 --> 00:11:37,330
I feel like it's a new coin term that's
been tossed around a lot as of late. Um,

179
00:11:37,331 --> 00:11:39,400
and it involves a lot of
different professionals,

180
00:11:39,401 --> 00:11:43,220
whether that be someone in
statistics, computer science, uh,

181
00:11:43,810 --> 00:11:46,510
someone like myself. That's why on the
analyst side and taking the numbers.

182
00:11:46,511 --> 00:11:47,890
So what does that all mean?
Um,

183
00:11:48,490 --> 00:11:52,690
and how did the hive take that and
apply it to the refugee crisis? Uh,

184
00:11:52,750 --> 00:11:55,450
so Aaron Hussein,
we built a data model.

185
00:11:55,780 --> 00:12:00,780
This model essentially allowed us to
target about 250 million Americans out of

186
00:12:01,691 --> 00:12:04,300
the 320 million in the United States.

187
00:12:04,540 --> 00:12:08,500
And it gave us a more complete and
kind of holistic understanding, uh,

188
00:12:08,520 --> 00:12:11,100
of an individual.
And so now we were being,

189
00:12:11,140 --> 00:12:15,880
we were able to see beyond just
the demographic variables of age,

190
00:12:15,881 --> 00:12:19,720
gender, income and so forth. But we were
able to see more of their attitudes,

191
00:12:19,721 --> 00:12:22,900
their purchasing behaviors, and
we were able to see, you know,

192
00:12:22,901 --> 00:12:26,860
whether they would have an affinity to
engage in the global refugee crisis and

193
00:12:26,861 --> 00:12:28,030
support our efforts.

194
00:12:29,980 --> 00:12:33,850
So what is predictive modeling?
Um, I'm sure this concept is,

195
00:12:33,851 --> 00:12:37,060
is certainly not a new one for
the folks in the room today.

196
00:12:37,061 --> 00:12:42,061
It's essentially the process of
taking data and defining and creating

197
00:12:42,641 --> 00:12:46,510
predictions of throughout the behavior.
In our case that the UN refugee agency,

198
00:12:46,511 --> 00:12:51,511
the desired behavior is obviously someone
that's going to support our efforts in

199
00:12:51,641 --> 00:12:55,210
addressing the refugee crisis.
Whether that be through donations,

200
00:12:55,390 --> 00:12:57,490
whether that be through
awareness and advocacy.

201
00:12:57,491 --> 00:13:02,491
And so what we did was we took a that
desired response and we created that as

202
00:13:03,161 --> 00:13:06,610
our target variable. We said
we would like, you know,

203
00:13:06,611 --> 00:13:10,840
John Doe who lives in California to engage
in the refugee crisis and everything

204
00:13:10,841 --> 00:13:14,740
about John Doe, whether that
be his age, gender, income,

205
00:13:15,060 --> 00:13:19,450
a household where he lives,
all that becomes the predictors.

206
00:13:19,850 --> 00:13:21,940
Um, and from the target
variable and the predictors,

207
00:13:21,941 --> 00:13:26,470
we ran statistical algorithms to
determine the association between the two.

208
00:13:27,190 --> 00:13:28,120
And then from that,

209
00:13:28,420 --> 00:13:33,420
we're able to see individually on a tour
of the 250 million Americans how they

210
00:13:34,211 --> 00:13:38,590
were likely to engage if serve the
right messaging on the right platform.

211
00:13:40,050 --> 00:13:40,640
Okay.

212
00:13:40,640 --> 00:13:43,510
So how did we build this predictive model?
Uh,

213
00:13:43,820 --> 00:13:48,360
we ran two national surveys and I've
persuasion online persuasion test,

214
00:13:48,620 --> 00:13:49,970
um, and these, uh,

215
00:13:49,971 --> 00:13:53,750
in the next few slides I'll go over how
we build these predictive models. Um,

216
00:13:53,810 --> 00:13:58,010
essentially this allowed us to
gauge those that are highly aware,

217
00:13:58,220 --> 00:14:02,720
highly supportive, and
highly knowledgeable of the
crisis in the United States.

218
00:14:05,210 --> 00:14:09,530
So the national survey was around in July,
2015 and not surprisingly,

219
00:14:09,860 --> 00:14:14,120
over 70% had never heard of
us. Um, which is, um, a result,

220
00:14:14,121 --> 00:14:18,210
which I'm sure maybe even yourselves
have not heard of us until today. Um,

221
00:14:18,260 --> 00:14:22,130
but interestingly six and 10 of
them supported our efforts and,

222
00:14:22,340 --> 00:14:25,240
and giving these life saving
assistance services, uh,

223
00:14:25,280 --> 00:14:30,170
to refugees in those first forcibly
displaced. So our brand was,

224
00:14:30,190 --> 00:14:34,640
was not very high. We also ran
an online persuasion test. And,

225
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,160
uh, from those messages, message frames,

226
00:14:37,161 --> 00:14:41,120
we were able to tell and Gardner where
the support was in the United States for

227
00:14:41,121 --> 00:14:43,550
the UN refugee agency and our efforts.

228
00:14:43,790 --> 00:14:48,380
One message that garnered support
on increasing economic aid,

229
00:14:48,730 --> 00:14:49,010
uh,

230
00:14:49,010 --> 00:14:54,010
was the message about over half of the
refugees are children under the age of

231
00:14:54,290 --> 00:14:57,920
17. And to give you a scale
of the sense of that, if,

232
00:14:57,980 --> 00:15:00,320
as Sean was saying earlier,
65,

233
00:15:00,470 --> 00:15:05,470
so 67 million people exist today globally
who have been forcibly displaced.

234
00:15:05,780 --> 00:15:10,700
Now imagine 65 million, put that in
half. That's around 32, 33 million.

235
00:15:10,701 --> 00:15:14,210
And that is essentially the
population of Canada. So take Canada,

236
00:15:14,520 --> 00:15:16,010
make them all under the age of 17,

237
00:15:16,011 --> 00:15:20,270
and say that is the size of the population
of children that are now forcibly

238
00:15:20,271 --> 00:15:20,931
displaced.

239
00:15:20,931 --> 00:15:25,880
So that is what moved Americans
into a supporting economic aid,

240
00:15:26,090 --> 00:15:29,390
uh, for refugees, which
is compelling message.

241
00:15:30,140 --> 00:15:34,160
Another message that had an effect on
accepting more refugees was the fact that

242
00:15:34,161 --> 00:15:38,180
refugees shape, uh, America,
including Albert Einstein.

243
00:15:38,860 --> 00:15:42,140
And so one of my,
I guess favorite examples,

244
00:15:42,141 --> 00:15:45,200
I have a refugee that's made some
huge differences in the world.

245
00:15:45,740 --> 00:15:47,270
So we ran this message test,

246
00:15:47,300 --> 00:15:50,540
we ran these surveys and we
have all this survey data.

247
00:15:51,020 --> 00:15:56,020
How did we use this data to build the
models while we first we took all the

248
00:15:57,020 --> 00:16:00,160
respondents and we upended the
demographic information. Uh,

249
00:16:00,260 --> 00:16:02,150
so you can see on the table here,
you know,

250
00:16:02,151 --> 00:16:06,470
we have or different scoring and we
were able to append a lots of variables.

251
00:16:06,470 --> 00:16:07,970
This is only gender Asian income.

252
00:16:07,971 --> 00:16:12,320
So it's not a true example of the sheer
amount of data that we had available to

253
00:16:12,321 --> 00:16:12,980
us.

254
00:16:12,980 --> 00:16:17,480
And we essentially took all that data
from the survey respondents and we narrow

255
00:16:17,481 --> 00:16:22,370
the variables using a statistical method
called Lasso in order to determine

256
00:16:22,580 --> 00:16:25,310
which, which of those variables
were the most predictive.

257
00:16:25,760 --> 00:16:30,110
After that we ran a logistic regressions
and from there then we cross validated

258
00:16:30,111 --> 00:16:32,420
the model to make sure that it didn't,
uh,

259
00:16:32,440 --> 00:16:35,510
over fit and at generalized
across different samples.

260
00:16:35,870 --> 00:16:39,290
And then from there we were able to
see those that were highly supportive,

261
00:16:39,590 --> 00:16:41,330
highly knowledgeable,
the crisis,

262
00:16:41,420 --> 00:16:44,570
highly aware and those that had
a willingness to be contacted.

263
00:16:45,380 --> 00:16:50,380
So from from there we were able then to
pend a scores to each of the individuals

264
00:16:52,010 --> 00:16:55,260
on our file, which is
about 250 million. Um,

265
00:16:55,340 --> 00:16:58,580
you'll see from this fictitious
supporter here, uh, Joe,

266
00:16:58,850 --> 00:17:02,660
he will have had all of his demographic
information, but in addition to that,

267
00:17:02,840 --> 00:17:06,830
the five scores, um, and so
support obviously for the crisis,

268
00:17:06,890 --> 00:17:11,380
eight would a high score, obviously
being a high probability, um,

269
00:17:11,470 --> 00:17:15,230
and then a look alike would be someone
that looks like our current donor and is

270
00:17:15,231 --> 00:17:18,710
likely to make a donation
and support our efforts.

271
00:17:19,380 --> 00:17:22,070
So if you can imagine,
then we have this,

272
00:17:22,150 --> 00:17:26,660
this model that it has a predictive
score for each of these individual

273
00:17:26,661 --> 00:17:27,291
Americans.

274
00:17:27,291 --> 00:17:32,291
And now we're able to see on a micro
level how to engage a different audiences

275
00:17:33,261 --> 00:17:34,370
in the United States.

276
00:17:35,630 --> 00:17:39,990
So we stacked these models on top of
each other and we ended up with five a

277
00:17:40,040 --> 00:17:42,180
target populations. Uh, the,

278
00:17:42,470 --> 00:17:46,580
the first one being the lookalikes
and that's 49 million individuals.

279
00:17:46,581 --> 00:17:51,581
So those are 49 million out of the
320 that likely I donate to that,

280
00:17:51,630 --> 00:17:53,100
to USA for your niche cr.

281
00:17:53,820 --> 00:17:58,140
And then we have who we call
the persuadables and those
are the core supporters,

282
00:17:58,170 --> 00:18:00,180
education and brand recognition.

283
00:18:00,570 --> 00:18:03,480
And those comprise about
14 million individuals.

284
00:18:03,481 --> 00:18:06,690
Now going back to what
Erin was saying on the 6%,

285
00:18:06,990 --> 00:18:10,650
that is certainly growing
that red segment. Uh,

286
00:18:10,651 --> 00:18:13,350
we are now approximately
out a million supporters.

287
00:18:13,351 --> 00:18:17,220
So that's 14 times more than a,
where we are now today.

288
00:18:17,220 --> 00:18:22,210
So it provides us a good testing ground
of microtargeting in a political Salway

289
00:18:22,290 --> 00:18:26,220
on these 14 million. And these
are people that are new audiences,

290
00:18:26,221 --> 00:18:30,030
so they aren't, you know, if they
are their prime to be engaged,

291
00:18:30,120 --> 00:18:33,750
but they are not yet I donating
and supporting our efforts.

292
00:18:34,050 --> 00:18:38,490
And then of course not surprisingly 173
million over half of the United States

293
00:18:38,491 --> 00:18:42,870
population or are non targets. So you
know, they don't look like our modeling.

294
00:18:42,871 --> 00:18:45,060
They're not likely to support our efforts.

295
00:18:46,560 --> 00:18:47,940
So after stacking these models,

296
00:18:47,941 --> 00:18:51,240
you can also see then on an individual
level what it would look like across the

297
00:18:51,241 --> 00:18:52,170
United States.

298
00:18:52,560 --> 00:18:57,560
And we're able to then to see on a map
geographically how to engage each of

299
00:18:57,631 --> 00:18:58,940
these supporters.
Um,

300
00:18:58,950 --> 00:19:02,190
and so what we've essentially done with
this predictive model is we've married

301
00:19:02,520 --> 00:19:04,320
that the products people buy,

302
00:19:04,321 --> 00:19:09,000
the brands they trust and their propensity
and likelihood to engage in a social

303
00:19:09,001 --> 00:19:10,710
issue like the refugee crisis.

304
00:19:11,070 --> 00:19:15,540
And we're able then to do political
style microtargeting married with our

305
00:19:15,541 --> 00:19:16,380
predictive modeling.

306
00:19:16,710 --> 00:19:21,150
So I'm going to hand it over back to Erin
to discuss how we take this data on a

307
00:19:21,151 --> 00:19:25,410
micro level and aggregate, uh,
into our campaigning. Oh, sorry.

308
00:19:25,470 --> 00:19:26,730
I'll take your question in the back,

309
00:19:27,020 --> 00:19:32,020
the first slide with
the individual straps,

310
00:19:34,140 --> 00:19:36,190
those are just examples of
where those things you actually,

311
00:19:37,460 --> 00:19:40,880
those are just examples where that
would show would probably be, you know,

312
00:19:40,881 --> 00:19:45,620
if they've subscribed to like wellness
health, um, uh, into that level unless,

313
00:19:45,621 --> 00:19:48,260
you know, we're able to receive
the letter from bon appetit.

314
00:19:48,261 --> 00:19:52,340
We weren't able to come from that.
So, um, thank you for the question.

315
00:19:53,190 --> 00:19:53,620
Okay.

316
00:19:53,620 --> 00:19:54,560
A hand it over.
And Aaron,

317
00:19:56,750 --> 00:20:01,740
thank you Rita. So I'm going to
talk about how we take that. Um,

318
00:20:01,860 --> 00:20:06,320
can we take all that data and all that
learnings that we absorbed and we turned

319
00:20:06,321 --> 00:20:08,990
it into campaigns to try to grow that 6%.

320
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:15,390
So,
so far we've run 22 micro campaigns,

321
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:19,210
all of these with a different
audience and a different goal. Um,

322
00:20:19,260 --> 00:20:22,710
and all of our campaigns
follow this same framework. Um,

323
00:20:22,740 --> 00:20:24,750
Rita kind of talked about
the first part of it,

324
00:20:24,751 --> 00:20:27,540
which is modeling the data
to find the right audience,

325
00:20:27,541 --> 00:20:31,980
to find the right people within that
persuadable buckets. The next part,

326
00:20:32,010 --> 00:20:35,850
which is just as important, is finding
the right context and messaging.

327
00:20:35,910 --> 00:20:39,120
And the right call to action.
So as we all know,

328
00:20:39,180 --> 00:20:42,690
there's so many different Americans and
we fall into so many different kinds of

329
00:20:42,691 --> 00:20:44,760
audiences that it really matters.

330
00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:49,630
It really mattered for us to find that
right and call to action to get that

331
00:20:49,631 --> 00:20:53,380
conversion. So for example, to the
campaigns I'm about to talk about,

332
00:20:53,381 --> 00:20:57,460
one is for an LGBT audience while one
is for a more Christian conservative

333
00:20:57,461 --> 00:21:01,780
audience. So they both obviously had to
have a little bit different messaging.

334
00:21:03,610 --> 00:21:03,860
Okay.

335
00:21:03,860 --> 00:21:08,750
The first one, which is one of my personal
favorites is called rainbow refugees.

336
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:09,240
Um,

337
00:21:09,240 --> 00:21:13,340
and we decided to do this campaign because
we really saw an opportunity within

338
00:21:13,341 --> 00:21:17,570
the LGBT AI audience because
they're already hyper political,

339
00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:22,010
very active, and they've accomplished
quite a bit in the last 20 years.

340
00:21:22,011 --> 00:21:26,690
So we thought maybe this audience
could also help us move the refugee

341
00:21:26,691 --> 00:21:27,650
conversation.

342
00:21:28,280 --> 00:21:33,140
And at the same time they're having
to be a major LGBTA refugee crisis,

343
00:21:33,440 --> 00:21:37,170
which few people are talking
about, especially in the media, um,

344
00:21:37,280 --> 00:21:41,970
because it doesn't fall into
the Syria, um, storyline. Um,

345
00:21:42,080 --> 00:21:46,510
but right now there's 77
countries where it's illegal. Uh,

346
00:21:46,580 --> 00:21:48,290
world homosexuality is illegal.

347
00:21:48,470 --> 00:21:52,340
So there's men and women that are fleeing
for their lives looking for safety

348
00:21:52,430 --> 00:21:53,900
just because of who they love.

349
00:21:54,350 --> 00:21:59,350
So we paired that messaging and
that issue with the LGBT audience.

350
00:21:59,480 --> 00:22:03,110
And so far we've seen a
huge uptick in engagement.

351
00:22:06,790 --> 00:22:10,360
One of the tools that we often kind
of tried to use was pop culture.

352
00:22:10,600 --> 00:22:13,840
Instead of trying to get people from
all these different backgrounds to come

353
00:22:13,841 --> 00:22:15,490
talk to us about refugees,

354
00:22:15,880 --> 00:22:19,150
we tried to go where they were
already having conversations online,

355
00:22:19,420 --> 00:22:23,260
whether it was the grammys or
in this case, the world series.

356
00:22:23,620 --> 00:22:26,110
So two years ago during the world series,

357
00:22:26,140 --> 00:22:30,730
we took a look at some of our big numbers
and some of the big numbers happening

358
00:22:30,731 --> 00:22:35,170
around baseball. And we quickly found
something that was pretty unique.

359
00:22:35,320 --> 00:22:40,320
So the amount of people that flee on
a daily basis at this time was 42,000

360
00:22:40,991 --> 00:22:45,490
people, which is the same size or
relatively close to the same size,

361
00:22:45,670 --> 00:22:50,260
is a lot of the baseball stadiums in the
United States. So we took some of the,

362
00:22:50,350 --> 00:22:54,280
we took some of the teams that were still
in the playoffs and we modeled up some

363
00:22:54,281 --> 00:22:55,870
of these social media memes.

364
00:22:56,140 --> 00:23:01,000
I'm trying to depict the idea of sitting
in that stadium and thinking about that

365
00:23:01,001 --> 00:23:03,400
whole stadium,
having to flee that day.

366
00:23:04,090 --> 00:23:07,720
And the really cool thing that we got out
of this was that we were able to reach

367
00:23:07,721 --> 00:23:09,670
a younger male audience,

368
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:14,010
which for any NGO is pretty incredible.
Our typical donor,

369
00:23:14,020 --> 00:23:16,630
like many NGOs is older women.

370
00:23:16,720 --> 00:23:19,990
So to be able to reach that
audience was pretty exciting for us.

371
00:23:22,340 --> 00:23:22,860
Okay.

372
00:23:22,860 --> 00:23:27,390
Another tool that we often tested and
tried with some of our campaigns was doing

373
00:23:27,391 --> 00:23:28,260
unbranded.

374
00:23:28,870 --> 00:23:33,810
Many studies show that Americans are more
likely to support a cause rather than

375
00:23:33,811 --> 00:23:37,020
a brand x,
especially if that brand has the UN in it.

376
00:23:37,410 --> 00:23:41,340
So one of the campaigns that we ran
that was unbranded was called under his

377
00:23:41,341 --> 00:23:45,300
wings. We built a community
targeting Christian conservatives,

378
00:23:45,480 --> 00:23:50,310
Catholics and tried to use messaging
that was more relatable to them. Um,

379
00:23:50,340 --> 00:23:54,070
we also tried to use the opportunity,
the pope coming to town, uh,

380
00:23:54,080 --> 00:23:58,420
as another opportunity to reach out to
this audience. So we ran a campaign, uh,

381
00:23:58,560 --> 00:24:02,490
which was, Jesus was a refugee,
uh, which was free bumper stickers.

382
00:24:02,730 --> 00:24:05,430
And we ran this full
page ad over here in the,

383
00:24:05,460 --> 00:24:08,880
in USA today when the pope
came to visit. Um, and we got,

384
00:24:08,910 --> 00:24:12,180
we had a lot of interest in, a lot of
people signed up for the free stickers,

385
00:24:12,181 --> 00:24:15,030
even some people that didn't
quite fall into that audience.

386
00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:17,460
But we're excited for a bumper sticker

387
00:24:19,670 --> 00:24:21,020
beyond just campaigns.

388
00:24:21,021 --> 00:24:25,370
We also have been building some digital
tools and different products the first

389
00:24:25,371 --> 00:24:29,800
time, first test into the product
world. We dead refugee emojis. Um,

390
00:24:29,801 --> 00:24:34,490
so this is the keyboard that we
built with a partner and so far we,

391
00:24:34,520 --> 00:24:39,110
so far it's been able to help us kind
of have a new way of engaging a younger

392
00:24:39,111 --> 00:24:40,920
millennial audience.
Um,

393
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:44,480
and it's also been helping us with
some of our data science currently.

394
00:24:44,481 --> 00:24:47,000
There's a lot of studies
going into sentiment and,

395
00:24:47,170 --> 00:24:52,170
and being able to kind of look at social
media and get sentiment scores based on

396
00:24:52,311 --> 00:24:56,450
emojis. So this has been helpful as
we kind of look further into that.

397
00:24:58,820 --> 00:25:01,010
And last but not least,

398
00:25:01,130 --> 00:25:04,400
we are working currently
on launching a new product.

399
00:25:04,730 --> 00:25:08,210
I'm using Facebook Messenger's
new BOT technology.

400
00:25:08,710 --> 00:25:13,340
We're working with a special
partner to slowly a scale up,

401
00:25:13,370 --> 00:25:17,870
a new product that would allow users
to have a more intimate and meaningful

402
00:25:17,871 --> 00:25:21,230
engagement with a refugee like character.
Um,

403
00:25:21,231 --> 00:25:25,460
so this will allow people to kind of have
a one on one experience with a refugee

404
00:25:25,730 --> 00:25:28,910
and in a way walk a mile in their shoes.
Um,

405
00:25:28,930 --> 00:25:33,920
so we are launching our Beta version, uh,
next week, uh, with World Refugee Day.

406
00:25:34,100 --> 00:25:37,730
If you guys didn't know World
Refugee Day is June 20th,

407
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:43,000
so if you go onto our Facebook next
week and you chat up our chat messenger,

408
00:25:43,310 --> 00:25:48,200
um, you can go through the experience.
Um, but just to warn you that it's very,

409
00:25:48,320 --> 00:25:52,790
uh, it's just our Beta, so
we are still testing. Um,

410
00:25:52,910 --> 00:25:57,350
and you can definitely expect more if
you watch this space. So with that,

411
00:25:57,351 --> 00:25:59,210
I'm going to turn it over
to my colleague Nick,

412
00:25:59,211 --> 00:26:02,540
who oversees our corporate partnerships
and he's going to talk about the amazing

413
00:26:02,541 --> 00:26:05,570
support of Google and how you
guys can get involved more.

414
00:26:08,900 --> 00:26:11,470
Alright, thanks Erin. And
thanks to everybody who's a,

415
00:26:11,471 --> 00:26:15,320
again taking time out of
your busy work day. And, um,

416
00:26:15,400 --> 00:26:17,880
I know we've had an opportunity
to talk a little bit about, uh,

417
00:26:17,890 --> 00:26:21,670
the great needs that UNHCRs facing
the work that unit chairs undertaking.

418
00:26:21,730 --> 00:26:24,940
Obviously the unique and
innovative work of the hive.

419
00:26:25,090 --> 00:26:28,870
But I really wanted to talk about the
great work that Google is doing and has

420
00:26:28,871 --> 00:26:33,490
been doing since we began
partnering with Google in 2015.

421
00:26:34,150 --> 00:26:37,870
So just for some context, um, since 2015,

422
00:26:37,871 --> 00:26:42,550
Google as an institution has provided
over three point $8 million in critical

423
00:26:42,551 --> 00:26:45,180
funding, uh, for UNHCRS programs. Um,

424
00:26:45,480 --> 00:26:48,990
in some cases specifically focused on
the Syria response in the surrounding

425
00:26:48,991 --> 00:26:52,890
region, countries such as Jordan and
Lebanon. And even more importantly,

426
00:26:52,940 --> 00:26:56,640
a Google is contributed some loosely
earmarked funds for UNHCRs general

427
00:26:56,641 --> 00:26:57,600
emergency response.

428
00:26:57,601 --> 00:27:01,140
I knew that Syria is often been
driving a lot of our talking points,

429
00:27:01,141 --> 00:27:06,141
but there's a global refugee crisis
that continues to unfold and as we again

430
00:27:06,151 --> 00:27:09,300
have highlighted, the needs
are tremendous. So, uh,

431
00:27:09,330 --> 00:27:12,210
Google support has been truly remarkable.

432
00:27:13,230 --> 00:27:15,630
One of the interesting things
about our partnership with Google,

433
00:27:15,631 --> 00:27:19,140
it's not certainly at all limited to
fundraising and it's actually a really

434
00:27:19,141 --> 00:27:21,990
dynamic,
multifaceted and global partnership.

435
00:27:22,440 --> 00:27:25,330
And certainly as a corporate
partnerships person, um,

436
00:27:25,350 --> 00:27:29,430
we always an often look beyond just
the cash resources of companies that we

437
00:27:29,431 --> 00:27:34,410
engage with, but to look to
their expertise, to look to
the capacity to really, um,

438
00:27:34,560 --> 00:27:36,990
you know,
advance amplify our work.

439
00:27:37,290 --> 00:27:40,050
I think one really great example
is the searching for Syria.

440
00:27:40,051 --> 00:27:43,440
A micro site that I know has
been mentioned in many ways,

441
00:27:43,441 --> 00:27:46,770
we're trying to reengage the u s
public in a very different manner.

442
00:27:46,830 --> 00:27:49,770
And the searching for serious
site has allowed us to humanize,

443
00:27:49,771 --> 00:27:54,750
to sh show exactly what life is like for
people living in these really difficult

444
00:27:54,751 --> 00:27:58,500
conditions. Um, certainly the mirroring
of Syria before and after the war is,

445
00:27:58,590 --> 00:28:02,910
it's really remarkable.
It's really relatable to
Americans because in many ways,

446
00:28:03,210 --> 00:28:08,010
a serious life before the war looked
similar in some respects to those in,

447
00:28:08,200 --> 00:28:11,160
in the United States. So, um, again,

448
00:28:11,161 --> 00:28:13,770
a big thank you for Google's
collaboration on that.

449
00:28:14,940 --> 00:28:19,940
And I wanted to talk a little bit about
Google's most recent employee engagement

450
00:28:19,981 --> 00:28:23,760
program and say a big huge thank
you to everybody in the room. Um,

451
00:28:23,790 --> 00:28:25,740
even if you haven't participated,
um,

452
00:28:25,760 --> 00:28:30,450
you're a valuable employee
voice on behalf of refugees. Um,

453
00:28:30,860 --> 00:28:35,860
today that campaign raised $440,000 for
USA for you and HCR and I've included

454
00:28:36,031 --> 00:28:39,990
just some bullets on what that
is equivalent to an UNHCRs,

455
00:28:40,210 --> 00:28:42,210
a programmatic universe.
I'm,

456
00:28:42,211 --> 00:28:45,900
one of the things that really sticks
out to me as somebody who's been working

457
00:28:45,901 --> 00:28:50,130
around the UN refugee agency for awhile
is that your support is equivalent to

458
00:28:50,460 --> 00:28:55,380
nearly 10,000 Syrian refugee children
gaining access to education. Um, again,

459
00:28:55,381 --> 00:28:59,010
back to the Syria narrative. I
know if you saw on the news, um,

460
00:28:59,220 --> 00:29:02,450
but there's often a lost
generation that's referred to, um,

461
00:29:02,460 --> 00:29:05,580
with kids being out of school in some
cases up to five, six, seven years.

462
00:29:05,850 --> 00:29:10,350
So for children to gain access back
to education, to regain normalcy,

463
00:29:10,351 --> 00:29:11,400
to um,

464
00:29:11,430 --> 00:29:15,030
be able to continue their education like
any other child should be able to, um,

465
00:29:15,031 --> 00:29:16,020
is hugely important.

466
00:29:16,021 --> 00:29:19,020
And we'll have a long term transformative
effect on those children's lives.

467
00:29:19,021 --> 00:29:21,660
So I really wanted to call
that one out in particular

468
00:29:23,850 --> 00:29:25,530
and beyond just the thank you,
um,

469
00:29:25,531 --> 00:29:28,440
which I think if anything else you take
away from my portion of the conversation

470
00:29:28,441 --> 00:29:30,140
is, again, thank you. Um,

471
00:29:30,180 --> 00:29:34,920
is just some additional ways that you as
Google employees can continue to help.

472
00:29:35,550 --> 00:29:38,940
Um, no, we've talked about searching for
Syria. If you haven't already done so,

473
00:29:38,941 --> 00:29:42,190
please do share with any of
your friends, colleagues, um,

474
00:29:42,191 --> 00:29:46,350
because they can become valuable allies
overall for UNHCRs work in the US.

475
00:29:46,820 --> 00:29:49,390
Um, continue to please to
commit to a workplace giving.

476
00:29:49,420 --> 00:29:52,240
I know that there's a variety
of institutions that, um,

477
00:29:52,241 --> 00:29:55,270
you can choose to support and we've been
fortunate enough to be chosen by Google

478
00:29:55,271 --> 00:29:55,781
employees at,

479
00:29:55,781 --> 00:29:59,830
it's such a wonderful level and it will
be talked about and Aaron's presentation

480
00:29:59,831 --> 00:30:02,320
World Refugee Day is next week.
Come June 20th.

481
00:30:02,680 --> 00:30:06,670
Please follow us on social media.
Uh, please amplify our messaging.

482
00:30:06,910 --> 00:30:10,900
It's really awesome to have, um, again,
an audience with you guys in touch.

483
00:30:10,901 --> 00:30:13,480
Good timing. So we can't
highlight that. Um,

484
00:30:13,510 --> 00:30:18,460
please visit our website and there
is a URL URL here. Excuse me.

485
00:30:18,730 --> 00:30:22,720
They can direct you to some additional
ideas of how you could even involve your

486
00:30:22,721 --> 00:30:27,250
communities and a fundraising awareness
activities. And again, lastly,

487
00:30:27,820 --> 00:30:29,470
please continue to follow
us on social media.

488
00:30:29,860 --> 00:30:34,060
And with that I'll just skip over to the
last line and open it up for questions.

489
00:30:35,920 --> 00:30:36,820
Please use the microphone.

490
00:30:45,300 --> 00:30:49,710
You have to have a 20% projects
that Googlers good, participated.

491
00:30:50,790 --> 00:30:53,030
I'm sorry I couldn't hear
that very well. So, uh,

492
00:30:53,130 --> 00:30:57,830
at Google we have the possibility of
spending some of our time either volunteer

493
00:30:57,831 --> 00:31:01,320
or as it's called 20% time.
Do you have any projects we can help with?

494
00:31:02,990 --> 00:31:04,940
Yup. Um, so Rita and I, uh,

495
00:31:04,941 --> 00:31:08,720
we can definitely take that because the
hive is always interested in working, um,

496
00:31:08,870 --> 00:31:11,720
especially with people in
the technology sector. Um,

497
00:31:11,780 --> 00:31:15,050
so definitely I can give you
our cards afterwards. Um,

498
00:31:15,110 --> 00:31:18,890
we'd love to hear kind of what your
background is. We kind of have our,

499
00:31:19,010 --> 00:31:22,520
our wishlist of things that we'd
like to do and want to do. Um,

500
00:31:22,521 --> 00:31:24,690
so usually we can kind of take,
um,

501
00:31:24,740 --> 00:31:28,280
what your background is and try to mirror
it with one of those projects. But yes,

502
00:31:28,281 --> 00:31:30,950
thank you.
We would be extremely happy for that.

503
00:31:31,040 --> 00:31:35,930
Yeah. And um, we also have, um,
internal website where people can,

504
00:31:36,110 --> 00:31:40,850
uh, different nonprofits can put a
bunch of volunteer opportunities and a,

505
00:31:40,851 --> 00:31:44,560
you can write down a set of skills and
all the rest and then after that, yeah,

506
00:31:44,720 --> 00:31:46,520
all the company will have access to it.
So.

507
00:31:47,100 --> 00:31:48,720
Great.
And if I could just add to Erin's comment,

508
00:31:48,721 --> 00:31:53,721
we are constantly looking
for data scientists that or
those that you don't call

509
00:31:54,061 --> 00:31:57,630
yourself a data scientist so you could
have the skills or data scientists that I

510
00:31:57,631 --> 00:32:00,490
can look at our data sets and assist us.
Um,

511
00:32:00,500 --> 00:32:01,860
I'm just going to hand
the mic over to Kevin.

512
00:32:03,320 --> 00:32:08,150
I'm just going to say
there is no official, a 20%
engagement in place right now,

513
00:32:08,300 --> 00:32:13,300
but that doesn't mean that you can't
engage sort of outside of the typical

514
00:32:14,121 --> 00:32:18,950
Google engagement model. Sure. But I do
know we have a volunteer site, which is,

515
00:32:18,980 --> 00:32:22,490
which is not specifically
20%, but like exactly. Yup.

516
00:32:23,690 --> 00:32:28,340
Got It. Cool. Thank you. Um, yeah.

517
00:32:28,430 --> 00:32:30,490
When you did your analysis,
um,

518
00:32:30,500 --> 00:32:34,580
was there anything that jumped out at
you that was something you didn't expect,

519
00:32:34,660 --> 00:32:37,400
um, when you were kind of
looking at demographics?

520
00:32:38,190 --> 00:32:40,070
Yeah, that's a great. Um,

521
00:32:40,820 --> 00:32:44,090
I think, you know, to pinpoint one,

522
00:32:44,360 --> 00:32:47,970
one finding i's hard and in that,
um,

523
00:32:48,200 --> 00:32:51,320
sometimes actually the most obvious
finding is very illuminating because we

524
00:32:51,321 --> 00:32:55,140
assume, as Erin was describing
earlier with a lot of the, uh,

525
00:32:55,520 --> 00:32:59,160
individuals that engage in social classes
and donate in the United States are,

526
00:32:59,330 --> 00:33:01,340
are women liberal leaning,
um,

527
00:33:01,490 --> 00:33:06,490
well specifically to our cause I given
the refugee crisis and where it stands

528
00:33:06,681 --> 00:33:09,110
politically. Um, so with that said,

529
00:33:09,320 --> 00:33:14,320
it's even illuminating to see that who
we think are our look alike are indeed

530
00:33:14,870 --> 00:33:17,430
who sign up and engage
on these micro tests. Um,

531
00:33:17,810 --> 00:33:21,770
so in that is a validation
in itself. Um, you know,

532
00:33:21,771 --> 00:33:25,460
sometimes we'll have moments where I
will run a test and we'll be like, well,

533
00:33:25,461 --> 00:33:30,140
that's Kinda interesting, weird outlier.
But, um, at this moment in time,

534
00:33:30,141 --> 00:33:32,840
I can't think of a
specific, but I would, um,

535
00:33:32,870 --> 00:33:37,370
there's certainly nothing that at this
moment we're able to scale and apply to

536
00:33:37,371 --> 00:33:39,710
the larger United States population.

537
00:33:43,050 --> 00:33:48,000
So you mentioned that about 6% of
Americans donee devotee statistics of how

538
00:33:48,001 --> 00:33:52,440
successfully hive has been able to like
expand that donor pool or how effective

539
00:33:52,441 --> 00:33:54,690
the target of a campaigning has been.

540
00:33:56,920 --> 00:33:57,753
Okay.

541
00:33:57,800 --> 00:34:00,140
Um,
I would kind of say it that we,

542
00:34:00,170 --> 00:34:04,490
we just kinda started to lay this
groundwork to really scale it up. Um,

543
00:34:04,491 --> 00:34:09,040
so I don't think we have any numbers
specifically around that 6%. Um,

544
00:34:09,140 --> 00:34:12,500
definitely there's been
an uptick in donations,

545
00:34:12,501 --> 00:34:15,900
especially to refugee
organizations recently, um,

546
00:34:15,980 --> 00:34:18,710
with certain things that have
been happening in the news. Um,

547
00:34:18,711 --> 00:34:23,690
so that has been in a way helpful. Um,
but we are really trying to kind of,

548
00:34:23,780 --> 00:34:27,890
um, you know, a lot of what we did in the
beginning was a lot of that testing. Um,

549
00:34:27,950 --> 00:34:30,650
so because there was
like 22 micro campaigns,

550
00:34:30,651 --> 00:34:34,030
now we kind of have an idea
of where to go next. Um,

551
00:34:34,280 --> 00:34:36,660
we're obviously not going to run 22 more.
Uh,

552
00:34:36,680 --> 00:34:40,810
we might just do one to three that
are much bigger and scale them. Um,

553
00:34:40,850 --> 00:34:43,290
but I also think regard
laying this groundwork, um,

554
00:34:43,640 --> 00:34:46,730
with the backbone of data science
that can also be applied to other

555
00:34:46,731 --> 00:34:51,370
organizations. Um, so we are
also talking with other NGOs, um,

556
00:34:51,510 --> 00:34:54,320
and trying to kind of, um, make it a more,

557
00:34:54,380 --> 00:34:58,940
a more cultural shifts similar in the
way that the Obama campaign really forced

558
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:01,220
political campaigns to make a total shift.

559
00:35:03,390 --> 00:35:04,950
Great question.
Um,

560
00:35:05,700 --> 00:35:09,450
one more about the refugee bought.
Why,

561
00:35:09,540 --> 00:35:11,190
why did you decide to do that?

562
00:35:11,191 --> 00:35:16,191
When there's like what seems like a
surplus of actual refugees that could kind

563
00:35:16,411 --> 00:35:18,690
of be in these chat sessions
you're trying to promote?

564
00:35:19,240 --> 00:35:23,500
Sure. Um, so there are kind
of, uh, there's two things
that are kind of happening.

565
00:35:23,501 --> 00:35:25,600
We do have UNHC our global,

566
00:35:25,601 --> 00:35:30,540
which is in Geneva and they have an
innovation team whose mandate is more, um,

567
00:35:30,700 --> 00:35:34,420
working directly on products that
support and help refugees. Um,

568
00:35:34,450 --> 00:35:35,950
I can't speak to it too much,

569
00:35:35,951 --> 00:35:40,951
but I do know that there some things in
the works to kind of build a Facebook,

570
00:35:41,310 --> 00:35:44,810
a similar Facebook Bot that is more
actually helping directly refugees.

571
00:35:44,811 --> 00:35:46,620
So if they have a question,
um,

572
00:35:46,650 --> 00:35:50,880
using AI will be able to
provide automated responses. Um,

573
00:35:51,030 --> 00:35:54,140
but for our, our mandate
is to really engage, um,

574
00:35:54,240 --> 00:35:58,020
Americans to kind of grow
support. Um, so we are,

575
00:35:58,080 --> 00:36:02,610
we're still in the testing phases of
exactly what we think that we can use. Uh,

576
00:36:02,640 --> 00:36:06,090
Facebook chatbots for, um, and,

577
00:36:06,270 --> 00:36:09,840
and so I think we're you asking why
we're not using actual refugees?

578
00:36:09,960 --> 00:36:12,300
Yeah.
Like instead of having an AI,

579
00:36:12,301 --> 00:36:14,990
why not just connect
people in actual refugees?

580
00:36:15,750 --> 00:36:19,030
A lot of that, a lot of that
does go back to safety. Um,

581
00:36:19,110 --> 00:36:23,040
a lot of times we can't use real
names. We can't give locations. Um,

582
00:36:23,070 --> 00:36:25,000
because a lot of times these people,
um,

583
00:36:25,170 --> 00:36:28,490
are targeted continuously
even after they flee. Um,

584
00:36:28,500 --> 00:36:32,820
so we have a lot of LGBT refugees whose
families even are out to get them.

585
00:36:32,821 --> 00:36:37,530
So we can't, a lot of times they're
reluctant to put their names out there.

586
00:36:37,531 --> 00:36:41,250
On a large scale, um, in
public. Um, but we do,

587
00:36:41,251 --> 00:36:45,240
we do use a lot of their stories and
a lot of their stuff to kind of create

588
00:36:45,241 --> 00:36:48,540
those, um, to create the personas.

589
00:36:51,170 --> 00:36:51,441
Sorry,

590
00:36:51,441 --> 00:36:54,980
just a quick corollary to that because
I think it speaks to a larger issue that

591
00:36:54,990 --> 00:36:58,910
you're perhaps raising is you ACR very
much does engage directly with refugees

592
00:36:58,911 --> 00:37:03,370
and some cases are small level
pilot level, I'd say. Um,

593
00:37:03,590 --> 00:37:04,460
entrepreneurship,

594
00:37:04,740 --> 00:37:08,120
a coding opportunities that are happening
in different locations through the

595
00:37:08,121 --> 00:37:11,060
world beyond just sort of
the refugee response in bots.

596
00:37:11,061 --> 00:37:14,620
There's a lot of other interesting
programs. Um, but yeah, she,

597
00:37:14,621 --> 00:37:17,390
she just knew it offline and I can follow
up more if this sounded interesting.

598
00:37:17,420 --> 00:37:19,220
Um,
so the slightly similar but

599
00:37:20,600 --> 00:37:21,433
response,

600
00:37:22,480 --> 00:37:22,670
um,

601
00:37:22,670 --> 00:37:26,630
you guys showed the sentences that kind
of calls people to donate more unless I

602
00:37:26,631 --> 00:37:29,900
was just wondering if there's a theme
among those like killed inspiration,

603
00:37:29,901 --> 00:37:32,350
like tying it to something
they may be able to relate to,

604
00:37:32,360 --> 00:37:34,410
like what that looked like.
Um,

605
00:37:35,060 --> 00:37:39,230
I should preface that that
survey was conducted on in July,

606
00:37:39,230 --> 00:37:42,710
2015 and so those message frames obviously
have changed dramatically since the

607
00:37:42,711 --> 00:37:47,050
2016 election. Um, and we did
recently random message test. Um,

608
00:37:47,360 --> 00:37:50,210
and we are still in the process
of analyzing those results,

609
00:37:50,211 --> 00:37:52,280
but certainly moral and compassion is,

610
00:37:52,550 --> 00:37:57,550
is a theme that resonates with Americans
and changing behavior and increasing

611
00:37:57,771 --> 00:38:01,220
support. And I'll just hand it over to
Erin and she took a key role in that,

612
00:38:01,280 --> 00:38:02,113
in that pilot.

613
00:38:02,230 --> 00:38:02,570
Yeah.

614
00:38:02,570 --> 00:38:03,830
Yeah. Um, as she said,

615
00:38:03,831 --> 00:38:06,230
we're still kind of analyzing
and going through all that data,

616
00:38:06,260 --> 00:38:09,050
but we did more recently,
a couple months ago,

617
00:38:09,051 --> 00:38:12,830
run a new message test and I think Rita
already kind of hit the nail on the head

618
00:38:12,831 --> 00:38:17,480
that it is moral compassion.
I'm calling on Americans and saying,

619
00:38:17,540 --> 00:38:21,920
America, we're compassionate. We're
giving, let's not turn our backs. Um,

620
00:38:21,921 --> 00:38:25,970
so that kind of messaging we really
saw, um, dead a little bit better.

621
00:38:31,560 --> 00:38:35,470
Any other questions? Okay. Well,

622
00:38:35,471 --> 00:38:38,430
thank you so much. Uh, everyone. Um,

623
00:38:39,530 --> 00:38:43,370
yes, thank you. Um, and obviously if you
guys have any other followup questions,

624
00:38:43,610 --> 00:38:46,370
if you're interested in anything
specific that we talked about,

625
00:38:46,610 --> 00:38:48,980
feel free to follow up.
We brought cards. Um,

626
00:38:49,070 --> 00:38:52,640
we also brought stickers
that say with refugees. Um,

627
00:38:52,641 --> 00:38:55,850
so if you guys want to take some, you
can take multiple given to your friends,

628
00:38:56,390 --> 00:39:01,150
take photos of them, put them on
social media Hashtag with refugees. Um,

629
00:39:01,280 --> 00:39:05,360
and as nick mentioned, World
Refugee Day is, uh, June 20th,

630
00:39:05,600 --> 00:39:08,390
so definitely, um, go online,

631
00:39:08,391 --> 00:39:12,200
sign our petition to stand with
refugees and uh, tell the world

632
00:39:13,320 --> 00:39:14,153
thank you.

633
00:39:14,170 --> 00:39:16,440
Oh,
and back to Kevin or a wonderful hubs.

634
00:39:17,280 --> 00:39:22,280
I was just going to say on the behalf of
everyone here and the employees of the

635
00:39:22,351 --> 00:39:25,470
New York City office, thank you guys for
coming. Thank you for sharing your story.

636
00:39:25,680 --> 00:39:28,710
Um, these guys will be here
for a little bit longer. Um,

637
00:39:29,410 --> 00:39:31,180
that's it.
Thanks.
