1
00:00:06,080 --> 00:00:08,450
Before I invite Tina up.

2
00:00:08,451 --> 00:00:11,240
I'd like to tell you a little
bit about her experience.

3
00:00:11,510 --> 00:00:16,510
She has over 20 years of experience
working with children and families and is

4
00:00:17,121 --> 00:00:21,890
the current parent trainer for the early
early support program for autism and

5
00:00:21,891 --> 00:00:26,210
four d RTP research program in the past.

6
00:00:26,211 --> 00:00:30,740
She was the director of the Easter Seals
Bay area autism program as well as the

7
00:00:30,741 --> 00:00:35,741
director of the Pacific Autism Center
for education and early intervention.

8
00:00:36,530 --> 00:00:41,420
And she's also completed trainings with
multiple developmental based approaches

9
00:00:41,900 --> 00:00:45,660
and has trained and supported
teams of developmental therapists,

10
00:00:45,661 --> 00:00:49,400
behavioral interventionists and teachers
to develop successful programs for

11
00:00:49,401 --> 00:00:51,140
children on the autism spectrum.

12
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:55,190
Join me in welcoming Gina stage.

13
00:00:59,630 --> 00:01:00,110
Oh,
thank

14
00:01:00,110 --> 00:01:02,000
you.
I'm happy to be here.

15
00:01:02,450 --> 00:01:06,020
Thank you all for attending
and all those remotely.

16
00:01:06,830 --> 00:01:11,180
So I have packets here today and I'm
just going to point out a few things.

17
00:01:11,181 --> 00:01:16,181
What I'm currently doing is the
early support program for autism.

18
00:01:16,221 --> 00:01:18,640
It's called s spa.
Awesome.

19
00:01:18,800 --> 00:01:22,490
And I want to point this out ahead of
time because I certainly will go through

20
00:01:22,800 --> 00:01:27,500
um, some resources at the end.
However you could call s Ba.

21
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:32,540
It's completely free at any time
and ask questions and get resources.

22
00:01:32,541 --> 00:01:36,410
And this is a collaboration between
Stanford Children's Health Council.

23
00:01:36,680 --> 00:01:40,460
You'll talk to Christina,
it's done in English and Spanish.

24
00:01:40,760 --> 00:01:42,230
It's 100% free.

25
00:01:42,680 --> 00:01:46,160
There's no boundaries when it
comes to where you're located,

26
00:01:46,161 --> 00:01:50,600
the age of the individual you're calling
about or what resources we've had.

27
00:01:51,090 --> 00:01:53,810
Um, infants come through, uh,

28
00:01:53,811 --> 00:01:58,811
with parent concerns up to adults
calling for themselves to get resources.

29
00:01:59,121 --> 00:02:03,350
They may not always get directed to
me for the parent training piece.

30
00:02:03,710 --> 00:02:07,770
However, we do find resources, um,

31
00:02:07,910 --> 00:02:11,310
and back way to parent
co call from Florida, uh,

32
00:02:11,390 --> 00:02:16,250
for resources for her daughter who attends
Stanford as a sophomore who is on the

33
00:02:16,251 --> 00:02:21,110
autism spectrum.
And so whatever calls we get,

34
00:02:21,470 --> 00:02:25,460
Christina will seek
out information and uh,

35
00:02:25,580 --> 00:02:28,940
and then she'll also tell you about any
research going on if you're interested

36
00:02:28,941 --> 00:02:31,580
in research programs with
Stanford or elsewhere.

37
00:02:31,910 --> 00:02:35,240
And also if you're interested
in this parent training,

38
00:02:35,241 --> 00:02:39,770
it's a one on one parent training with
me. It's done over four sessions. It's,

39
00:02:40,100 --> 00:02:44,150
there's no time constraints to this.
You can do it remotely or in person.

40
00:02:44,151 --> 00:02:48,890
And again, it's 100% free.
And did we, based in,

41
00:02:48,891 --> 00:02:50,090
because it's one on one,

42
00:02:50,091 --> 00:02:54,590
we talk about your child and techniques
to help in any given situation with your

43
00:02:54,591 --> 00:02:56,690
child and your family as a whole unit.

44
00:02:58,100 --> 00:02:59,740
And then there's other in here.

45
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:04,600
What about additional free
classes that CMHC offers?

46
00:03:04,750 --> 00:03:08,710
Um, and, and Christina can even speak
on those if you have any questions.

47
00:03:09,340 --> 00:03:14,340
So I'm going to get into this a
PowerPoint and typically it takes me,

48
00:03:16,260 --> 00:03:18,310
um,
more than an hour.

49
00:03:19,090 --> 00:03:21,490
And so if I don't get through every slide,

50
00:03:21,491 --> 00:03:24,700
don't worry about it because
there is overlap and this,

51
00:03:24,701 --> 00:03:28,150
and I don't typically
stick to the slides anyway.

52
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:32,200
So this is just a lot of information
about children's health council.

53
00:03:32,620 --> 00:03:35,830
And you can look at that,
uh, at your convenience.

54
00:04:26,570 --> 00:04:30,850
We're going to talk about a child's
success and looking at it from a

55
00:04:30,851 --> 00:04:33,920
developmental approach.
Um,

56
00:04:34,030 --> 00:04:38,140
and we will look in particular
at the interactive environment,

57
00:04:38,141 --> 00:04:43,141
how to create a successful environment
for both you and your child to connect

58
00:04:43,961 --> 00:04:47,650
and stretch their skills and then
creating opportunities and finding those

59
00:04:47,651 --> 00:04:50,320
teachable moments. And
for parents, especially,

60
00:04:50,321 --> 00:04:54,010
it's about finding those
moments throughout the flow
of the day where when you

61
00:04:54,011 --> 00:04:57,220
have programs set up,
they'll do more intensive stuff.

62
00:04:57,221 --> 00:05:00,910
But certainly these techniques are
really important to know. Um, and to,

63
00:05:01,060 --> 00:05:05,740
to hold everyone working with your
child to a high standard of, um,

64
00:05:06,010 --> 00:05:10,810
getting these individually,
these opportunities to teach and teaching.

65
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:17,460
So when we talk about creating
an interactive environment, it,

66
00:05:17,510 --> 00:05:20,500
it's really pivotal.
If we want success,

67
00:05:20,501 --> 00:05:24,070
we set a child up for success
and success does build success.

68
00:05:24,071 --> 00:05:27,710
So the more opportunities
they have to be successful,

69
00:05:27,711 --> 00:05:31,090
and sometimes we call it the,
the preemptive strike,

70
00:05:31,091 --> 00:05:33,340
we're going to call it
success before it is.

71
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:38,140
We create that confidence and
we can keep building on it. Um,

72
00:05:38,170 --> 00:05:42,040
but in setting up the
environment for success, again,
for both you and your child.

73
00:05:42,640 --> 00:05:47,080
And so we look at the yes items
and those are the teachable items.

74
00:05:47,620 --> 00:05:50,440
The no items or our conversation stoppers,

75
00:05:50,450 --> 00:05:53,950
they stop and interaction.
And so yes,

76
00:05:53,951 --> 00:05:56,020
items are redirection.

77
00:05:56,050 --> 00:06:00,200
It's our items we can say
yes to and then teach.

78
00:06:00,210 --> 00:06:04,700
And you know, we, I look, we've worked
with parents to find these in everything.

79
00:06:05,420 --> 00:06:09,500
And so for,
if I'm working with a child in a room,

80
00:06:10,130 --> 00:06:13,880
the child doesn't know me and sometimes
we'll go to the door and you'll see this

81
00:06:13,880 --> 00:06:14,713
later in the slide.

82
00:06:14,780 --> 00:06:19,340
I really want to be a good audience to
receive all of the child's communication.

83
00:06:20,180 --> 00:06:23,810
And when they don't have the language,
I put the language to it. However,

84
00:06:23,811 --> 00:06:26,660
I'm going put all my energy
and excitement to my yes item.

85
00:06:26,990 --> 00:06:31,430
So if they try to open the door and I
said, oh, not time flat affect flat tone.

86
00:06:31,431 --> 00:06:35,780
I say not time to open the door yet,
but we can open bubbles, we can open,

87
00:06:35,781 --> 00:06:40,730
played out in all my energy goes to my
yes and my excitement goes to my yes.

88
00:06:40,940 --> 00:06:45,320
I'm not going to spend a lot of time
explaining and no a way like don't touch

89
00:06:45,321 --> 00:06:46,880
that. No, it's not time to go outside.

90
00:06:46,881 --> 00:06:50,160
We could do that later
because what happens is it's,

91
00:06:50,320 --> 00:06:52,280
it's even as an adult when we hear no,

92
00:06:52,281 --> 00:06:56,480
it's a bit of a staying and we're
listening a little less right. For kids,

93
00:06:56,540 --> 00:07:00,500
they almost grab on to that
what they were working towards,

94
00:07:00,501 --> 00:07:04,550
that no item a little harder.
And that's where we see the fits are,

95
00:07:04,551 --> 00:07:08,900
that's where we see, um, not really
interacting with you so much,

96
00:07:09,050 --> 00:07:11,480
especially if we're constantly,
oh no, don't do that. Nope.

97
00:07:11,530 --> 00:07:14,240
Take it out of your mouth. Oh No,
don't touch that. Well, we're,

98
00:07:14,250 --> 00:07:17,510
we're not really interactive
where the no person,

99
00:07:17,570 --> 00:07:20,200
so we want to find the yeses in,

100
00:07:20,210 --> 00:07:24,050
in as much as possible in these
situations. I do teach no,

101
00:07:24,350 --> 00:07:28,850
but tick typically it's in an interaction.
It's in a game. If I say, you know,

102
00:07:29,180 --> 00:07:32,630
is the ball over on the chair?

103
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:37,720
And I said no with huge
gestures and a big response,

104
00:07:38,340 --> 00:07:42,440
really obvious gestures, a
point and everything else. Um,

105
00:07:42,480 --> 00:07:46,280
and then when I buy a third time,
I always find it's my, yes, yes.

106
00:07:47,240 --> 00:07:51,650
Um, so we really want to find those yeses
and, and keep away from the nose. If,

107
00:07:51,670 --> 00:07:55,100
if it is a no flat affect,
flat tone,

108
00:07:55,101 --> 00:07:58,460
we don't want to give a lot of
energy towards it. No. You know,

109
00:07:58,461 --> 00:08:02,270
with kids in general, whether
there's a diagnoses or not, uh,

110
00:08:02,300 --> 00:08:05,180
that energy gets a response.

111
00:08:05,181 --> 00:08:09,470
So if it's a exciting no or an
exciting yes, it doesn't matter.

112
00:08:09,860 --> 00:08:13,580
So we want the yeses to be
where our excitement goes. Um,

113
00:08:13,610 --> 00:08:15,410
providing interactive items.

114
00:08:16,550 --> 00:08:20,990
So we want to look for items that create
back and forth because the teaching

115
00:08:20,991 --> 00:08:25,430
comes through connection. And then
that, so social loops of interaction,

116
00:08:26,150 --> 00:08:30,710
you know,
teaching an isolated ways does work.

117
00:08:31,490 --> 00:08:36,490
We don't always see it generalized into
other environments or with other people.

118
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:41,180
And so in these, uh, this approach
that I'll talk about today, it's,

119
00:08:41,181 --> 00:08:45,770
it's really looking at the everything
being taught through loops of interaction.

120
00:08:46,550 --> 00:08:51,550
Because the ultimate goal is for this
individual I'm working with to go and

121
00:08:53,271 --> 00:08:56,430
share these tools with their peers,

122
00:08:56,910 --> 00:08:59,910
not with me or not with other,
what we call manual,

123
00:08:59,911 --> 00:09:03,630
a predictable in their control.
Adults. That'll be in the slide too.

124
00:09:04,590 --> 00:09:08,520
Um,
so interactive items,

125
00:09:09,150 --> 00:09:13,260
and I know that Google, however, we
stay away from tech as much as possible.

126
00:09:13,530 --> 00:09:17,640
I can't be as exciting as
tech. Right? The, the what?

127
00:09:17,641 --> 00:09:22,641
Everything I'll ask you to be
today is what kids get from,

128
00:09:24,630 --> 00:09:28,460
you know, what they're watching
on youtube or in video or um,

129
00:09:28,590 --> 00:09:31,410
the songs and dance and
all that colorful stuff.

130
00:09:32,100 --> 00:09:34,470
Certainly there's things
we can teach to that,

131
00:09:34,471 --> 00:09:39,450
especially for watching as well
and doing some pausing and kind of,

132
00:09:39,480 --> 00:09:44,250
um, acting it out or asking
questions. But it is limited.

133
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:48,480
Uh, we want, we don't want,
we get rid of our competition.

134
00:09:49,260 --> 00:09:51,630
So tech would be my competition.

135
00:09:51,930 --> 00:09:55,140
I want items that I can bring the fun too.

136
00:09:55,141 --> 00:09:58,170
It's not the object is
there to support the play.

137
00:09:58,920 --> 00:10:03,520
However the person is the primary focus.
Uh,

138
00:10:03,930 --> 00:10:06,660
that object is not fun
without me involved.

139
00:10:06,990 --> 00:10:11,070
So you're looking for items that
don't have the bells and whistles,

140
00:10:11,071 --> 00:10:15,780
the lights and the, the noise
is the battery items. Um,

141
00:10:15,781 --> 00:10:20,610
so ideally really basic toys.

142
00:10:21,390 --> 00:10:23,730
I like items like a,
what's called ICOM,

143
00:10:23,731 --> 00:10:26,850
a poll tube and you just pull
it along and you can spin it.

144
00:10:26,851 --> 00:10:28,080
You can do all kinds of stuff.

145
00:10:28,380 --> 00:10:32,700
So thinking of items that you can get
a child excite to look you're way more

146
00:10:32,701 --> 00:10:37,170
often and wants you to do it again.
And again to promote functional language,

147
00:10:40,890 --> 00:10:45,120
um, creating an interactive environment.
Again, be a good sensory detective.

148
00:10:45,810 --> 00:10:47,280
So typically when I do this talk,

149
00:10:47,281 --> 00:10:52,281
I do this kind of experimental or I try
to give you some type of taste of what

150
00:10:54,990 --> 00:10:58,830
sensory may be going on with the child
and we're always doing our best guests

151
00:10:58,831 --> 00:11:02,850
because we cannot say
what affects a child.

152
00:11:02,851 --> 00:11:06,840
We can observe and we can make
best guesses. Um, however,

153
00:11:06,870 --> 00:11:09,060
when we're talking about
young kids in general,

154
00:11:09,780 --> 00:11:12,420
we know that their sensory
system is immature.

155
00:11:12,450 --> 00:11:15,390
When we're talking about child who's not
hitting all those milestones the way we

156
00:11:15,391 --> 00:11:19,620
expect them to, we're going to
kind of guess that there is some,

157
00:11:19,860 --> 00:11:24,240
there are some interruptions
and their sensory development.

158
00:11:25,320 --> 00:11:30,320
And so being a good sensory detective is
investigating the environment setting.

159
00:11:30,511 --> 00:11:30,871
Again,

160
00:11:30,871 --> 00:11:34,410
the environment up for success is getting
rid of items that are going to be an

161
00:11:34,440 --> 00:11:38,550
issue. So I work with a little boy now
who will mouth a lot of soft plastics.

162
00:11:38,551 --> 00:11:43,350
I don't bring soft plastics into the
session. I'll bring hard plastic toys.

163
00:11:43,351 --> 00:11:45,630
I bring items that I
can create interaction,

164
00:11:45,631 --> 00:11:50,040
but I am not going to spend time
taking things out of their mouth.

165
00:11:50,130 --> 00:11:53,920
I also will make sure there's a
replacement for items like that.

166
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:58,780
So if a child is mild thing
for being a sensory detective,

167
00:11:59,800 --> 00:12:02,350
I view that as there's a need there.

168
00:12:02,410 --> 00:12:07,410
And as a responsible adult I need to
help that child meet that need so they

169
00:12:08,021 --> 00:12:11,800
don't have to keep seeking out
items to meet it themselves.

170
00:12:12,220 --> 00:12:16,570
And so replacement, yes items is
really important. Um, you know,

171
00:12:17,110 --> 00:12:17,800
having,
you know,

172
00:12:17,800 --> 00:12:21,570
your work with an occupational therapist
may end of times they'll use it to a

173
00:12:21,610 --> 00:12:25,450
chewy and uh, you know,
some kids do well with that,

174
00:12:25,451 --> 00:12:28,990
some don't or they get bored after a
while. So they'll do it for a little bit,

175
00:12:28,991 --> 00:12:30,580
but they'll still grab the other items.

176
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:35,380
Having other items that
might provide more input. Um,

177
00:12:36,200 --> 00:12:39,310
dish wash cloth, a dry
wash cloth, does that,

178
00:12:39,311 --> 00:12:43,180
cause they can get it back into
areas that a chewy doesn't get and,

179
00:12:43,181 --> 00:12:46,660
and it kind of can, it's more
malleable. It can get into,

180
00:12:46,940 --> 00:12:49,150
it gets wet and then you can
move it around a lot more.

181
00:12:49,870 --> 00:12:53,590
It's an acceptable item. Um, some,

182
00:12:53,591 --> 00:12:55,570
I know parents who have
done handkerchiefs,

183
00:12:55,720 --> 00:13:00,430
so they're always accessible that way.
So looking for again, yes items even,

184
00:13:00,500 --> 00:13:02,470
um,
teething rings still.

185
00:13:02,471 --> 00:13:05,610
I mean when they come out of the freezer
sometimes that can give a nice relief

186
00:13:05,611 --> 00:13:07,900
or whatever's going on and you know,

187
00:13:07,901 --> 00:13:12,160
also trying lots of
different pressure and areas,

188
00:13:12,161 --> 00:13:14,530
which if you work with a
good occupational therapists,

189
00:13:14,531 --> 00:13:16,660
they work a lot on the sensory system too.

190
00:13:16,661 --> 00:13:19,540
And they'll put a child on
what they call a sensory diet,

191
00:13:20,650 --> 00:13:25,030
which is deep input, different
type of movements for development.

192
00:13:25,890 --> 00:13:30,260
Um, you also want to make changes to
the environment. Again, you know, if a,

193
00:13:30,280 --> 00:13:33,470
if a child get rid of the no items,
but also if,

194
00:13:33,471 --> 00:13:37,130
if the law and you have great lights
here, in fact, part of my, um,

195
00:13:37,810 --> 00:13:42,400
experiment I do is the shaking the
lights and off and on and shaking a bag,

196
00:13:42,401 --> 00:13:46,780
making lots of noise and it drives
most parents crazy and you can't focus.

197
00:13:47,410 --> 00:13:50,620
And I said, that's a little
taste of what may be going on,

198
00:13:50,830 --> 00:13:52,720
that what you're asking out of your child.

199
00:13:52,721 --> 00:13:57,640
They're filtering through all
those layers of, of sensory issues.

200
00:13:58,180 --> 00:14:01,120
So yeah, it takes time to process.
If they could do it easily,

201
00:14:01,121 --> 00:14:02,830
they would be doing it easily.

202
00:14:03,400 --> 00:14:08,400
And so to acknowledge that it is hard
and so we need to set up that environment

203
00:14:09,401 --> 00:14:13,660
to give as much success as
possible. Um, so you know,

204
00:14:13,661 --> 00:14:18,240
having access to a
trampoline or being beggar,

205
00:14:18,340 --> 00:14:22,900
even cushions for deep pressure or
being able to jump in on the bed, doing,

206
00:14:23,410 --> 00:14:25,560
um, tight, uh,

207
00:14:26,200 --> 00:14:29,490
rolling a child up in a blanket
tightly and back out, uh,

208
00:14:29,740 --> 00:14:34,510
which we call a Burrito and kids love it
and we'd get lots and lots of language

209
00:14:34,511 --> 00:14:38,830
out of activities like that because
number one, they can't do themselves.

210
00:14:39,100 --> 00:14:42,310
We were, we have to be a
part of it. And number two,

211
00:14:42,311 --> 00:14:45,310
it relaxes their body and gives
him the light blood, nice input.

212
00:14:45,311 --> 00:14:47,140
And so they do what more and more.

213
00:14:47,410 --> 00:14:51,130
So I keep stretching with as we
continue and I get them more engaged,

214
00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:53,700
excited about their activity.
Um,

215
00:14:54,600 --> 00:14:58,460
so you want to remove items
that are an issue, support,

216
00:14:58,461 --> 00:15:00,830
sensory regulation.
You know,

217
00:15:01,010 --> 00:15:04,130
if you look at activities online,

218
00:15:04,131 --> 00:15:09,131
you just want to try different things
to really have a nice array of sensory

219
00:15:10,281 --> 00:15:12,830
movement,
sensory input activities.

220
00:15:13,550 --> 00:15:17,930
And it depends on what the
child is seeks out or voids. Um,

221
00:15:18,440 --> 00:15:21,150
you know, again, there's a lot of good oh,

222
00:15:21,350 --> 00:15:24,770
occupational therapists out there
and if you're not working with one,

223
00:15:25,430 --> 00:15:29,420
their websites will give you a lot
of tips as well. You can also search,

224
00:15:29,421 --> 00:15:34,070
which I've done many times to get ideas
as brain gym and then I'll just look at

225
00:15:34,071 --> 00:15:39,071
the images under brain gym and he'll give
me ideas of helping a child move their

226
00:15:39,591 --> 00:15:40,970
body in different ways.

227
00:15:41,510 --> 00:15:46,010
So they are what they call crossing the
mid point and working both sides of the

228
00:15:46,011 --> 00:15:49,820
brain. Um, things that when we don't do
for a while and then you try to do it,

229
00:15:49,821 --> 00:15:52,910
you realize it's not
as easy as you thought,

230
00:15:53,300 --> 00:15:56,530
like jumping jacks and then I'll
try to do, and I'm like, oh,

231
00:15:56,531 --> 00:15:59,900
I think I forgot how to do a
jumping jack or jumping rope.

232
00:16:00,300 --> 00:16:05,150
I'm skipping right. Sounds like no big
deal. If you haven't done it for a while,

233
00:16:05,151 --> 00:16:09,680
try it. You'll realize your brain's lost
a little of that. You can get it back,

234
00:16:09,950 --> 00:16:11,060
but it takes practice

235
00:16:12,640 --> 00:16:15,350
and really paying attention
to the child's ongoing needs.

236
00:16:15,351 --> 00:16:17,750
One of the things you want to
be as a good sensory detective,

237
00:16:18,200 --> 00:16:20,140
there's just sit step,
you know,

238
00:16:20,150 --> 00:16:25,150
step back and observe and observe the
finer details of what your child is doing

239
00:16:27,830 --> 00:16:31,100
that you may want to
look for ways to support.

240
00:16:31,970 --> 00:16:36,580
Because if we can't be a
partner in this, we can be, um,

241
00:16:36,950 --> 00:16:41,720
play a role and the need to open and
shut a door and all of a sudden it's our

242
00:16:41,721 --> 00:16:44,990
idea. Instead of US stopping
them constantly from doing it,

243
00:16:45,950 --> 00:16:50,330
they're going to turn more and more to
you as a partner instead of somebody that

244
00:16:50,331 --> 00:16:51,680
no person in that,

245
00:16:56,100 --> 00:17:00,160
um, position yourself for eye
contact. You want eye contact,

246
00:17:00,161 --> 00:17:05,161
make it really easy be at his or her
I love are lower and then capture it.

247
00:17:05,530 --> 00:17:09,130
You'll see it later. And again, I jumped
around the slides, but reinforce it,

248
00:17:09,131 --> 00:17:12,660
everything you want to see how that
child more often reinforce, oh good luck

249
00:17:14,190 --> 00:17:18,670
and do it with that nice energy.
Um, but if, if, if you're,

250
00:17:18,730 --> 00:17:22,810
if you're working or you have a child
who doesn't have nice eye contact and you

251
00:17:22,811 --> 00:17:26,590
want it, set them up for
success, make it really easy,

252
00:17:26,591 --> 00:17:31,450
take all the obstacles out of it and
then reinforce it each and every time.

253
00:17:31,810 --> 00:17:33,310
And I know sometimes it's quick,

254
00:17:33,550 --> 00:17:37,810
but I mean I will capture it con if I'm
working on it, I'll get it each time,

255
00:17:37,811 --> 00:17:41,470
even if and moving and then I get to slow
it down a little bit more and a little

256
00:17:41,471 --> 00:17:42,304
bit more.

257
00:17:43,630 --> 00:17:43,980
Yeah.

258
00:17:43,980 --> 00:17:46,920
Promote reciprocal interaction.
Again,

259
00:17:46,921 --> 00:17:49,380
everything we teach through
loops of interaction.

260
00:17:49,410 --> 00:17:52,710
And so you'll see it later in the slide,

261
00:17:52,711 --> 00:17:57,390
but that pause is really important.
And for that anticipation of,

262
00:17:57,391 --> 00:18:02,160
I know I'm going to get something back
and I'm available to receive it back.

263
00:18:02,850 --> 00:18:05,300
Um, and you know, many times when I,

264
00:18:05,370 --> 00:18:10,370
I'll work in a room with no distractions
and where I don't have to run after a

265
00:18:11,071 --> 00:18:14,460
child a lot to get eye contact.
Um,

266
00:18:14,520 --> 00:18:18,180
and so that way we can do a lot more
of the back and forth reciprocal

267
00:18:18,181 --> 00:18:18,731
interaction.

268
00:18:18,731 --> 00:18:23,731
She might look at space like that and
make it a space that a child wants to stay

269
00:18:23,761 --> 00:18:27,910
in because it's so much fun because
you bring the fun to it. Um,

270
00:18:28,680 --> 00:18:33,090
offer visual steps when necessary
and schedules. So, you know,

271
00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:38,040
it's, it's more impactful of a
learning opportunity. If we see it,

272
00:18:38,041 --> 00:18:39,990
we hear and we experienced it,

273
00:18:40,590 --> 00:18:43,290
I have a better chance of
taking that skill with me.

274
00:18:43,950 --> 00:18:48,770
So visuals are really important.
Whether I'm an actual item, uh,

275
00:18:49,080 --> 00:18:53,910
icon, a picture of an item, or
I do it in gestures like, Oh,

276
00:18:53,911 --> 00:18:57,660
do you want pizza or chicken?
And there's nothing there.

277
00:18:57,960 --> 00:19:00,390
But it helps with visualization,
which helps with,

278
00:19:00,690 --> 00:19:04,290
when kids do get into chapter books
and things like that, you know,

279
00:19:04,291 --> 00:19:06,600
you have to be,
it's the same as social comprehension.

280
00:19:06,601 --> 00:19:11,490
You have to be for reading comprehension,
able to visualize the characters.

281
00:19:11,491 --> 00:19:16,050
Visualize the environment and then start
making predictions of what could happen.

282
00:19:17,100 --> 00:19:20,730
And that's the same for that social piece.
That's why it's so hard.

283
00:19:20,731 --> 00:19:25,620
There's all those unwritten rules
of what it means to socialize and be

284
00:19:25,621 --> 00:19:27,750
successful.
Um,

285
00:19:27,780 --> 00:19:32,780
and so you want to make it really obvious
and schedule sometimes help visual

286
00:19:33,511 --> 00:19:34,500
steps help.

287
00:19:34,800 --> 00:19:39,000
One of the things you want to be careful
is to do us too many schedules and then

288
00:19:39,001 --> 00:19:42,060
you get a more rigid individual,
right?

289
00:19:42,540 --> 00:19:47,310
We want flexibility within
those schedules. So if I
have a schedule planned out,

290
00:19:47,311 --> 00:19:52,200
why it might have a special activity
in that. Um, you know, if you're going,

291
00:19:52,260 --> 00:19:54,020
if you drive disk,

292
00:19:54,090 --> 00:19:57,960
a child to school every day and you
have options to go multiple routes,

293
00:19:57,961 --> 00:20:02,100
you want to take a left turn next time
instead of our right turn when you go on

294
00:20:02,101 --> 00:20:07,080
walks. She wanted to explore, be
curious and go different directions. Um,

295
00:20:07,260 --> 00:20:09,860
we can do a lot of flexible,
um,

296
00:20:10,650 --> 00:20:14,670
demonstrations even with our speech.
So if I say go shut the door,

297
00:20:14,671 --> 00:20:15,930
I can also say go close.

298
00:20:15,931 --> 00:20:19,440
The door means the same thing
and people say it differently.

299
00:20:20,130 --> 00:20:24,780
And so you want to vary your language,
uh, for Nice flexibility as well.

300
00:20:28,520 --> 00:20:29,353
Okay.

301
00:20:29,480 --> 00:20:31,230
When we're creating opportunities,

302
00:20:31,231 --> 00:20:33,690
and some of this I'll go through in
more detail, you want to be manageable,

303
00:20:33,691 --> 00:20:38,520
predictable in a child's control.
You know, the, the social world,

304
00:20:38,900 --> 00:20:42,330
um, a lot of things in, in an
individual's life are not manageable,

305
00:20:42,331 --> 00:20:46,110
predictable in their control. And
so it's scary and that's, and,

306
00:20:46,111 --> 00:20:48,340
and especially if their sensory issues.

307
00:20:48,341 --> 00:20:53,341
And so that's where you see a child runoff
or bite or hit wanting to get out of

308
00:20:54,860 --> 00:20:59,110
what's a very scary situation.
Um, and so as adults,

309
00:20:59,140 --> 00:21:02,800
we can be that.
Within that we can,

310
00:21:02,860 --> 00:21:05,230
we will expect flexibility and we'll,

311
00:21:05,231 --> 00:21:09,130
we'll try and challenge a
child in a healthy manner. Um,

312
00:21:09,210 --> 00:21:12,430
and we'll go into that in more
detail and be irresistible, right?

313
00:21:12,940 --> 00:21:17,770
Be the fun of the play and
make it obvious. You know,

314
00:21:17,830 --> 00:21:20,680
what you're, what it looks like. Um,

315
00:21:20,830 --> 00:21:24,370
invite your child to take
healthy risk. Uh, you know,

316
00:21:24,371 --> 00:21:28,330
that's really important for them.
It's a little scary,

317
00:21:28,810 --> 00:21:31,290
but if I can be manageable,
predictable, and the control and, and,

318
00:21:31,291 --> 00:21:36,291
and give little pieces of a risk and risk
is very different for different kids.

319
00:21:37,540 --> 00:21:41,510
I had a bean bag one time in a room
where a child does a lot of, uh,

320
00:21:41,590 --> 00:21:46,150
really more academic work
and not the social piece.

321
00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:49,600
And he sat in a beanbag and I thought,
oh,

322
00:21:49,690 --> 00:21:53,310
I'm going to do a sensory
social activities, we call it.

323
00:21:53,311 --> 00:21:56,560
And so I went and I picked the beanbag up.
You know,

324
00:21:56,561 --> 00:22:00,030
I kind of gave pressure and I just
picked it up. I said, oh, oh, oh,

325
00:22:00,280 --> 00:22:04,750
just to my knees. And he was
scared. And so I went down, down,

326
00:22:04,751 --> 00:22:08,860
down, and I did not let go because I
knew he would be out of that bean bag.

327
00:22:09,070 --> 00:22:13,180
And I know he'll enjoy it if he
can see that it is manageable,

328
00:22:13,181 --> 00:22:17,760
predictable in his control that
is safe. So I do it again. Oh Oh,

329
00:22:18,170 --> 00:22:19,730
ah, down, down,

330
00:22:19,731 --> 00:22:24,280
down and again later in
slide always comes up for,

331
00:22:24,340 --> 00:22:25,810
I have a very clear beginning,

332
00:22:25,811 --> 00:22:30,580
middle and end to my routine and I'm
going to do it at least three times the

333
00:22:30,581 --> 00:22:33,730
rule of three. If a child needs
it more cause I think, oh,

334
00:22:33,731 --> 00:22:34,870
he still needs a little more,

335
00:22:34,871 --> 00:22:39,250
he looks scared but he's starting to
relax and I'll do it more typically three

336
00:22:39,251 --> 00:22:43,390
does it for me and I'll
do it again. Uh, oh, ah,

337
00:22:43,750 --> 00:22:44,620
known down,

338
00:22:44,621 --> 00:22:49,621
I put him down again and then I let go
and he stayed in and he actually set up

339
00:22:50,801 --> 00:22:54,910
up, up. Right. So I do
it again up at this time.

340
00:22:54,911 --> 00:22:59,770
I go all the way up and I go down and
we did a few more times and he tells me

341
00:22:59,771 --> 00:23:04,300
up, up, up for more. It's a more, because
what I really want now is for him to say,

342
00:23:04,480 --> 00:23:09,470
I have got them, I've captured them
into this activity. But now, uh, up,

343
00:23:09,500 --> 00:23:13,720
is it really appropriate? You can tell
me more. That would be more appropriate.

344
00:23:13,721 --> 00:23:18,700
So I say more and I do up, up, up,
and then I add something to it.

345
00:23:18,701 --> 00:23:22,840
I had this spin and if I spend
a child one way, I always spin,

346
00:23:22,870 --> 00:23:26,530
spin them the other way. Again,
it's more impactful for our child,

347
00:23:26,531 --> 00:23:30,730
so if a child's running around a
lot or spinning, get them to grow.

348
00:23:30,731 --> 00:23:33,910
Tate reverse.
I see reverse go the other way.

349
00:23:33,911 --> 00:23:36,250
So I started teaching those
words by defining them.

350
00:23:36,251 --> 00:23:41,140
At the same time we're doing them and
it's, they won't need as much spinning.

351
00:23:41,830 --> 00:23:44,920
You know? Some kids can spin
constantly, get not get dizzy,

352
00:23:45,330 --> 00:23:47,570
spin them one way and
spend them the other way.

353
00:23:48,010 --> 00:23:53,010
Their bodies are impacted
in a more satisfactory way
and they won't need as much

354
00:23:53,061 --> 00:23:55,910
spinning and stuff are running around.
It's hard to,

355
00:23:55,911 --> 00:23:59,810
if a child's running in a circle and
you say, stop, reverse. I mean they,

356
00:23:59,840 --> 00:24:03,310
they're in this momentum.
It's even a child without a diagnosis.

357
00:24:03,320 --> 00:24:07,040
They have a trouble then going the
other way and I hold them to it.

358
00:24:07,140 --> 00:24:11,000
Anything I ask of a child, I hold them
to it. Whether I helped them or not,

359
00:24:11,030 --> 00:24:13,580
whether they do it independently or not,
doesn't matter to me,

360
00:24:14,060 --> 00:24:15,780
but I do hold them to the expectation.

361
00:24:15,781 --> 00:24:20,781
So they know that I'm always going to
hold you to these expectations and those

362
00:24:20,811 --> 00:24:25,310
expectations. If this is where their
skill level is, I'm doing the next step.

363
00:24:25,460 --> 00:24:29,000
I'm not leaping, you know, we're
not doing brain surgery now.

364
00:24:29,690 --> 00:24:32,150
I want success.
And so it set next step.

365
00:24:33,120 --> 00:24:33,953
MMM.

366
00:24:34,310 --> 00:24:36,920
So this is a very healthy,
healthy risk for a child.

367
00:24:36,921 --> 00:24:38,180
And I know he's going to love it.

368
00:24:38,480 --> 00:24:42,170
And so I keep adding onto this activity.

369
00:24:43,100 --> 00:24:46,190
You and I start teaching,
no, yes, in this activity.

370
00:24:46,191 --> 00:24:49,760
Because if you give him
a choice or if I say,

371
00:24:49,761 --> 00:24:54,140
do you want to go down? He'll say,
go down. He just repeats, right?

372
00:24:54,141 --> 00:24:58,250
The last couple of words. Um, and
so I want him to say yes or no.

373
00:24:58,251 --> 00:25:03,140
So I started teaching yes and no in this
activity, going up, doing some spins,

374
00:25:03,141 --> 00:25:06,620
and it was in a playful way of,
instead of putting them on the floor,

375
00:25:06,621 --> 00:25:08,840
I'd say down, down, down on the counter.

376
00:25:09,680 --> 00:25:14,540
And that was a know that.
And so I would have again by three,

377
00:25:14,541 --> 00:25:18,950
I was on down, down on the
floor. Yes, yes. And then I,

378
00:25:19,250 --> 00:25:20,180
next time I'd say down,

379
00:25:20,181 --> 00:25:24,590
down like on the chair and
I'd wait for him to answer no.

380
00:25:25,340 --> 00:25:30,140
After I demonstrate it a few times and
then he would start, start to go, no.

381
00:25:30,141 --> 00:25:33,950
I'm like no.
And then get to the yes item.

382
00:25:35,400 --> 00:25:36,233
MMM.

383
00:25:37,610 --> 00:25:40,670
By doing these things
again, being manageable,
predictable and its controller,

384
00:25:40,730 --> 00:25:44,930
rarely much more interactive
partner in this and be responsive,

385
00:25:44,931 --> 00:25:48,110
which is that thank you's.
And you'll see that in another slide.

386
00:25:49,340 --> 00:25:54,290
So being manageable. These are some nice
questions to ask yourself. You know,

387
00:25:54,800 --> 00:25:59,470
grabbing things out of a child's
hands, not manageable, uh,

388
00:25:59,600 --> 00:26:03,140
moving too quickly.
You want that slow approach.

389
00:26:03,141 --> 00:26:07,350
You want those pauses and ah,
and, and sounds and sounds,

390
00:26:07,380 --> 00:26:10,670
your activities,
they know it's coming again with a child,

391
00:26:10,671 --> 00:26:13,880
with the diagnoses are not my child. There
are other child doesn't matter to me.

392
00:26:13,881 --> 00:26:18,881
I always do these type of techniques
and you get a more of a buy in by doing

393
00:26:20,151 --> 00:26:24,560
these type of techniques. So, even if
I'm about to just tickle or something,

394
00:26:24,561 --> 00:26:26,160
you know,
it's coming because you know,

395
00:26:26,190 --> 00:26:30,240
ticklings one of those things that
there's a little bit of fun to it,

396
00:26:30,241 --> 00:26:34,880
but mostly it's not a fun activity
because you get a kid's cracking up,

397
00:26:34,881 --> 00:26:39,370
but you keep doing it and they've
already passed that enjoyable, um,

398
00:26:39,500 --> 00:26:43,860
kind of fine line, but they're
laughing stills you keep at it.

399
00:26:44,550 --> 00:26:47,040
Um, and so, you know,
being really manageable,

400
00:26:47,041 --> 00:26:49,500
predictable in their control for
stuff like that. So you always,

401
00:26:49,560 --> 00:26:54,560
I always show a child my approach like
you come to so he'd know it's coming.

402
00:26:54,960 --> 00:26:59,400
They're cracking up from the anticipation
because it's much funnier than the

403
00:26:59,401 --> 00:27:03,630
actual tickles. And they'll
say, ah, tickle, tickle,
tickle, and then right back up.

404
00:27:04,260 --> 00:27:07,590
But, you know, I'm not too far where
if my approach is way over there,

405
00:27:07,591 --> 00:27:11,340
it's not so much fun or if I'm too close,
it's a little scary.

406
00:27:11,850 --> 00:27:14,350
It's really manageable.
Um,

407
00:27:14,430 --> 00:27:18,930
and that anticipation is really
important for social anticipation.

408
00:27:19,110 --> 00:27:20,220
Being able to read something,

409
00:27:20,221 --> 00:27:24,340
anticipate what's going to happen
by reading the environment, the,

410
00:27:24,350 --> 00:27:28,230
the body language, his facial
affect, the movements, um,

411
00:27:28,350 --> 00:27:30,390
is so important for social success.

412
00:27:31,650 --> 00:27:36,420
And we can teach that early
on with those pauses. Ah, ah,

413
00:27:36,690 --> 00:27:40,050
you know, and have that sound to
it. And I'll even do multiply.

414
00:27:41,930 --> 00:27:42,763
And you know,

415
00:27:42,780 --> 00:27:45,570
kids think it's much funnier than if
I just went in and start tackling.

416
00:27:45,840 --> 00:27:49,200
Plus you get a child looking
more and tracking. Um,

417
00:27:49,300 --> 00:27:52,890
so either attending instead of just
getting the needs met and then being gone.

418
00:27:54,250 --> 00:27:54,920
MMM.

419
00:27:54,920 --> 00:27:57,860
You know, being really careful through
removing things from kids hanging. If I,

420
00:27:57,861 --> 00:28:00,320
if a child is playing
with a car or something,

421
00:28:00,321 --> 00:28:03,590
I'm going to join them exactly
what they're doing. However,

422
00:28:03,591 --> 00:28:07,310
I'm going to have my own car.
I mean, won't personally be my,

423
00:28:07,311 --> 00:28:09,920
I'll probably be another
one of his or hers,

424
00:28:10,310 --> 00:28:14,240
but still I don't ever take
the child's item from them.

425
00:28:14,270 --> 00:28:15,680
Even if I'm trying to demonstrate,

426
00:28:15,950 --> 00:28:20,900
I do it by joining them and then offer
something in addition to what they're

427
00:28:20,901 --> 00:28:25,430
already finding mastery and pleasure from.
Um,

428
00:28:25,580 --> 00:28:29,000
being careful about standing
behind her above. I mean,

429
00:28:29,001 --> 00:28:31,280
none of us liked somebody
too close behind us.

430
00:28:31,281 --> 00:28:35,060
It's uncomfortable if I am behind a
child and I'm going to help them with

431
00:28:35,061 --> 00:28:38,960
something, I put my hands out in front
and say, um, I'm here in my hands,

432
00:28:38,961 --> 00:28:39,794
I'm going to help.

433
00:28:40,130 --> 00:28:42,800
And then I might help them do hand
over hand or something like that.

434
00:28:43,280 --> 00:28:46,590
Picking up a child. Same thing. Mine or
not, it doesn't matter to me. I'll say,

435
00:28:46,591 --> 00:28:50,480
I'm gonna pick you up and I don't wait
for a yes or no. I might tell him,

436
00:28:50,481 --> 00:28:51,181
why am I,
oh,

437
00:28:51,181 --> 00:28:55,640
we're going across the big street and pick
you up and then I pick up or you know,

438
00:28:55,641 --> 00:28:58,610
this car. So you have to hold
my hand and then I take him.

439
00:28:58,611 --> 00:29:00,200
But I let them know
what's going to happen.

440
00:29:00,710 --> 00:29:03,650
I make myself available and then
I have followed through to that.

441
00:29:04,730 --> 00:29:06,860
Um, um, being, being

442
00:29:06,860 --> 00:29:10,760
predictable again,
helping them anticipate what's coming.

443
00:29:11,270 --> 00:29:12,680
And you do that with the pauses,

444
00:29:14,300 --> 00:29:18,560
make sure they know what their role
is and what your role is in that.

445
00:29:18,561 --> 00:29:23,390
So sometimes it's explicitly saying
that. And you know, as parents,

446
00:29:23,780 --> 00:29:28,780
I think we all do this is we put things
in a question instead of a comment and

447
00:29:29,361 --> 00:29:32,150
you know,
I know better to do that.

448
00:29:32,151 --> 00:29:36,110
And I still seem to throw a question at
the end. I'll say, oh, time for bed. Okay.

449
00:29:36,140 --> 00:29:39,830
And I think, why am I doing it?
Okay. It's not, I'm not asking,

450
00:29:40,160 --> 00:29:43,780
I'm stating, um, and so
if you're not asking,

451
00:29:43,781 --> 00:29:47,230
don't put it in a question
form when you say, Oh,

452
00:29:47,231 --> 00:29:51,070
do you want to play or can I
play with you? I wouldn't ask.

453
00:29:51,250 --> 00:29:54,130
You're gonna because you're
probably going to get a no.

454
00:29:54,340 --> 00:29:58,090
Unless you're going to accept
that no walk away or let's try it.

455
00:29:58,140 --> 00:30:00,190
You want to try it this
way? And then it's like, no,

456
00:30:01,390 --> 00:30:05,800
well then I would join exactly
what they're doing and it's, Oh,

457
00:30:05,860 --> 00:30:09,430
I'm going to try it like this. And then
you demonstrate what you're going to try.

458
00:30:10,710 --> 00:30:13,080
But you want to make it
clear what's expect. No,

459
00:30:13,081 --> 00:30:16,000
I can step up to an expectation
if they don't know what it is.

460
00:30:16,870 --> 00:30:18,610
And so making that very clear,

461
00:30:18,611 --> 00:30:23,611
what is expected with little
language and gestures,

462
00:30:24,700 --> 00:30:29,260
right? Put you don't have
to explain things away.

463
00:30:29,500 --> 00:30:31,180
What you want is that follow through.

464
00:30:31,240 --> 00:30:35,140
And the more they can
follow nonverbal gestures,

465
00:30:35,740 --> 00:30:36,880
the more they're watching.

466
00:30:38,050 --> 00:30:43,050
And the more you're helping increase
their observation skills for observing

467
00:30:43,391 --> 00:30:44,224
peers,

468
00:30:45,430 --> 00:30:49,450
learning how to know what's
going on and that social setting,

469
00:30:50,020 --> 00:30:54,100
which will help them know how to join
and maintain the social interaction.

470
00:30:55,700 --> 00:30:56,533
Um,

471
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:03,000
and giving that time again with the
sensory issues that may be going on,

472
00:31:04,930 --> 00:31:09,550
processing time is really
important. So if I say, Oh,

473
00:31:09,551 --> 00:31:13,960
do you want water? And they
don't answer, I'm like,

474
00:31:14,680 --> 00:31:19,120
water, do you want the water? Do you want,

475
00:31:19,121 --> 00:31:23,710
you want a drink of water?
Each time I speak,

476
00:31:25,060 --> 00:31:26,590
it's like starting all over.

477
00:31:26,650 --> 00:31:30,100
So I ask and then they start processing
the information that I ask again.

478
00:31:30,101 --> 00:31:34,720
It's like, okay, I start processing
again. Then yes, different ways to,

479
00:31:34,900 --> 00:31:38,290
sometimes we touch, look at me,
which is very overwhelming, right?

480
00:31:38,291 --> 00:31:40,930
Skins our largest Oregon
taking in stimulation.

481
00:31:41,620 --> 00:31:46,330
And so then I've got a process
that in addition to you talking,

482
00:31:46,510 --> 00:31:51,280
in addition to is maybe some demand you're
putting on me in addition to lights,

483
00:31:51,760 --> 00:31:56,140
uncomfortable chairs, temperature,
whatever else is going on,

484
00:31:56,230 --> 00:31:58,570
hearing a fan, um, you know,

485
00:31:58,571 --> 00:32:03,430
we can all sit here and ignore
many things in tune in. Uh,

486
00:32:03,450 --> 00:32:04,150
I wouldn't,

487
00:32:04,150 --> 00:32:08,050
I wouldn't assume your child can do that
and I wouldn't assume your child knows

488
00:32:08,051 --> 00:32:09,520
what's expected out of them.

489
00:32:10,900 --> 00:32:14,200
I was working with a little boy of the
day and he said something about soccer.

490
00:32:14,890 --> 00:32:19,840
So I'm like, oh, I have an idea, you know?
And so I said, we had a ball and I say,

491
00:32:20,060 --> 00:32:22,090
well, let's play soccer.
You're going to kick the ball.

492
00:32:22,091 --> 00:32:24,580
And I'm the goalie and I have to stop it.

493
00:32:25,360 --> 00:32:28,450
And he couldn't act on any of it.

494
00:32:29,260 --> 00:32:34,240
And so I kind of made it really obvious
of what it looked like. And then,

495
00:32:34,750 --> 00:32:35,770
and so his mom later told me,

496
00:32:35,771 --> 00:32:39,500
he has no idea what soccer is or
anything else you just said. Well,

497
00:32:39,501 --> 00:32:43,040
he's the one who brought it
up. So I, I assumed he knew.

498
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:48,260
And for all of these specialties,
social activities, even things like tag,

499
00:32:48,980 --> 00:32:51,410
it seems like a pretty simple game.

500
00:32:51,980 --> 00:32:56,960
But unless you play with your child and
you see that he or she knows all the

501
00:32:56,961 --> 00:32:57,794
roles in it,

502
00:32:57,800 --> 00:33:02,120
that you don't just keep running at you
actually tag and then you run away and

503
00:33:02,121 --> 00:33:05,330
try not to be tagged again.
Who's it,

504
00:33:05,331 --> 00:33:09,650
who's nodded what the rules are.
And they've gotten a lot more complicated.

505
00:33:09,651 --> 00:33:11,960
Kids aren't just playing tag.
If you're at a playground,

506
00:33:11,961 --> 00:33:15,260
you'll hear him make up
a lot of thematic play,

507
00:33:15,261 --> 00:33:19,910
pretend play around tag. They'll
say like, if you touch the ground,

508
00:33:19,911 --> 00:33:21,910
it's lava and your blah,
blah.

509
00:33:21,920 --> 00:33:26,510
And it's all these rules now that make
it really complicated. So as you're,

510
00:33:26,600 --> 00:33:30,410
as you're playing games like this with
your child, you want to start to make,

511
00:33:30,500 --> 00:33:33,800
put kind of themes around it,
stories around it,

512
00:33:33,980 --> 00:33:37,820
make it more complicated in a,
in a way that's manageable,

513
00:33:37,821 --> 00:33:42,270
predictable in their control. And
B, again, being a good partner,

514
00:33:42,310 --> 00:33:46,070
making it really obvious what their
role is and what your role is.

515
00:33:50,370 --> 00:33:54,790
Um, making sure they feel in control
doesn't mean they get control. Um,

516
00:33:54,870 --> 00:33:59,670
however,
helping them manage this,

517
00:34:00,600 --> 00:34:04,350
uh, the scariness of it all and
giving them a sense of control.

518
00:34:04,680 --> 00:34:07,200
So if they're,
whatever they're motivated by,

519
00:34:07,201 --> 00:34:10,260
that's where we start when
we're connecting with the child.

520
00:34:11,220 --> 00:34:15,660
And then we can add more things to it
that maybe are not where they're motivated

521
00:34:15,740 --> 00:34:19,590
or maybe is it,
is it is not a preferred activity.

522
00:34:19,620 --> 00:34:24,090
I can go in that direction. So as
I work with kids, I, it's, it's,

523
00:34:24,110 --> 00:34:27,780
it's certainly child led.
So it's third agenda.

524
00:34:28,140 --> 00:34:31,800
I had my goals and I never
get rid of my goals, however,

525
00:34:31,801 --> 00:34:35,800
I start at their skill level,
their interests, and then
my steps to the goal is,

526
00:34:35,910 --> 00:34:40,140
is in that direction and it's constantly
stretching and it's really layered

527
00:34:40,141 --> 00:34:42,020
learning cause I'm getting eye contact,

528
00:34:42,360 --> 00:34:47,160
I'm demonstrating what lots of Nice
facial expression, nice tone of voice.

529
00:34:47,580 --> 00:34:51,600
Um, you know, whatever skill I'm
working with, if it's a concept,

530
00:34:51,601 --> 00:34:56,100
if it's expanding on play and
I'm getting loops of interaction.

531
00:34:57,000 --> 00:35:00,540
So it's not just me. Um, it's,

532
00:35:00,570 --> 00:35:05,370
it's not just me meeting needs,
it's back and forth.

533
00:35:07,660 --> 00:35:08,620
I'm being really,

534
00:35:08,621 --> 00:35:13,621
and that's the whole sensory detective
is responding to their body language.

535
00:35:14,230 --> 00:35:18,040
What is a child telling you? But
especially around that nonverbal language.

536
00:35:19,150 --> 00:35:23,980
Um, so if a child pushes away, I'm about
to tickle and they turn their body,

537
00:35:23,981 --> 00:35:26,650
I'll say all done tickler,
no tickle.

538
00:35:27,190 --> 00:35:32,020
And if they come back testicle Oh,
more or whatever. Um, but I, I'm,

539
00:35:32,110 --> 00:35:37,110
I'm very responsive to body language and
what that's telling me and I functional

540
00:35:37,891 --> 00:35:39,630
language to that body language.

541
00:35:40,710 --> 00:35:41,120
Okay.

542
00:35:41,120 --> 00:35:44,540
Um, the toys, again, not
taking the toys away,

543
00:35:45,110 --> 00:35:49,280
not withholding. You'll see it later.
You don't want to withhold items.

544
00:35:49,370 --> 00:35:51,890
If a child saying, you
know, buck for banana,

545
00:35:52,130 --> 00:35:55,190
I can work in and go in the
direction of the word banana,

546
00:35:55,191 --> 00:35:59,270
but I'm not going to withhold that banana
until they say banana because I'm not

547
00:35:59,300 --> 00:36:02,840
a good partner here.
I'm not user friendly.

548
00:36:03,410 --> 00:36:05,960
They're gonna walk away
way before we get there.

549
00:36:06,710 --> 00:36:09,860
And so being responsive as being
that user friendly partner.

550
00:36:10,990 --> 00:36:11,560
Yeah.

551
00:36:11,560 --> 00:36:14,260
Um, not to stop or interrupt,
play when plays going on.

552
00:36:14,261 --> 00:36:16,870
We just want to keep expanding
on it and expanding on it

553
00:36:19,540 --> 00:36:24,040
and again knows we'll stop it. Uh,
certain items being taken away,

554
00:36:24,041 --> 00:36:28,780
stop it being irresistible.
The big expressions,

555
00:36:29,320 --> 00:36:33,670
you'd draw attention their face. These
are the things to be socially successful.

556
00:36:33,671 --> 00:36:38,020
And with social success we see
learners because they're observing.

557
00:36:38,140 --> 00:36:40,870
They read the situation
and then they'll imitate.

558
00:36:40,871 --> 00:36:45,810
They'll learn from what they're seeing,
the things we want them to imitate. Um,

559
00:36:45,870 --> 00:36:49,420
and, and they start to learn from their
peers instead of having to be taught

560
00:36:49,421 --> 00:36:51,400
directly. And so we want, again,

561
00:36:51,401 --> 00:36:56,401
want to make it really obvious early
on with the exaggerated expressions.

562
00:36:57,430 --> 00:37:00,550
Um, letting them see your face, pausing,

563
00:37:01,060 --> 00:37:03,760
exaggerating your movement, uh, the,

564
00:37:03,790 --> 00:37:06,100
if they're working on
point or whatever else,

565
00:37:06,101 --> 00:37:09,850
make it really obvious what
that looks like. I mean, again,

566
00:37:09,851 --> 00:37:11,380
you think it's no big deal,
but you know,

567
00:37:11,381 --> 00:37:14,440
to learn to isolate this
finger amongst all of the rest,

568
00:37:14,620 --> 00:37:16,720
it takes a lot of brain power.

569
00:37:16,721 --> 00:37:21,430
The messages have got to get through our
bodies to isolate these motor movements

570
00:37:21,870 --> 00:37:23,810
in. Sure. We do it all the time. That if,

571
00:37:23,820 --> 00:37:28,180
if the messages aren't going
through your, you know, from your,

572
00:37:28,540 --> 00:37:33,220
from through your body to the brain
and then back in a timely manner,

573
00:37:33,820 --> 00:37:35,140
you're not seeing this.

574
00:37:36,510 --> 00:37:40,590
And so you want to make it really
obvious of what it looks like.

575
00:37:41,010 --> 00:37:44,910
Demonstrate it so that there's
no question of what's expected.

576
00:37:45,630 --> 00:37:49,770
Um, sound draws a men even with
bubbles, if I say, you know, oh,

577
00:37:49,860 --> 00:37:51,250
bubbles pop,

578
00:37:52,030 --> 00:37:56,080
stuff like that, right? If all I do
is this, a child's not going to watch.

579
00:37:56,081 --> 00:37:59,830
I want to tracking,
I want them invested in this activity.

580
00:38:00,040 --> 00:38:04,570
I want them making sounds cause some
leads to language and what kids,

581
00:38:04,571 --> 00:38:07,420
young kids especially do
is they put sound to play.

582
00:38:08,380 --> 00:38:10,990
And so getting all those
sounds going in different ways,

583
00:38:10,991 --> 00:38:14,620
whether it's jumping on
the bed or running around.

584
00:38:15,190 --> 00:38:18,460
And a lot of times for kids,
if they don't have language,

585
00:38:18,970 --> 00:38:20,230
and I put sounds to it,

586
00:38:20,231 --> 00:38:24,580
they're able to initiate play with
me with the sound because they don't,

587
00:38:24,610 --> 00:38:28,450
can't say, oh, I want you to do bubbles
for me again. They'll just stay.

588
00:38:28,510 --> 00:38:30,140
Oh.
And I'll say [inaudible]

589
00:38:30,930 --> 00:38:33,390
I give again,
give back the functional word for it,

590
00:38:33,630 --> 00:38:37,270
but I accept the language they're
able to give me at that moment

591
00:38:39,300 --> 00:38:43,200
and make that activity much more
fun with you than without you.

592
00:38:44,550 --> 00:38:47,190
And that means being manageable,
predictable in their control.

593
00:38:47,191 --> 00:38:51,310
Because when you're not, it's not fun
for them. You're taking away from um,

594
00:38:51,390 --> 00:38:55,080
their activity,
the way they have to do it in that moment.

595
00:38:55,980 --> 00:38:59,100
Can we join exactly what they have
to do and then I can stretch it.

596
00:38:59,101 --> 00:39:02,910
But if I go and just decide a child who
is maybe spinning wheels and I go and

597
00:39:02,911 --> 00:39:06,030
say, oh, that's not how you play with
car. Did you take the car and you go are,

598
00:39:06,690 --> 00:39:11,460
or even if I make it fun, it won't matter.
This is where he is. He's mastered this.

599
00:39:12,090 --> 00:39:15,150
It fulfills him in some way.
I need to respect that.

600
00:39:15,960 --> 00:39:20,670
And so I joined an exactly that and
then I add to this, ah, you know,

601
00:39:21,420 --> 00:39:25,170
go fast or slow. I do some concept
and I do the rule of three.

602
00:39:25,620 --> 00:39:28,620
Would that beginning, middle and end
and say, you know, Gina's wheels,

603
00:39:28,621 --> 00:39:32,970
I got to go fast, ready, set, go,

604
00:39:35,550 --> 00:39:38,880
make it really obvious. And I go back
to joining at his pace and the old guy,

605
00:39:39,320 --> 00:39:44,310
dude, his wheels are going again and I'll
do that same way at least three times.

606
00:39:44,311 --> 00:39:49,020
And if he keeps looking,
I know he's interested and
then I want more out of him.

607
00:39:49,320 --> 00:39:53,630
What I really wanted to imitation with
a little boy, I'm actually thinking of,

608
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:56,220
he didn't give me a mutation,
so I went back to joining.

609
00:39:56,221 --> 00:40:00,210
He kept looking over and I'm still
here and I would just keep doing this.

610
00:40:00,211 --> 00:40:04,110
And finally he said, Ma. And he
didn't have language. He had a pro,

611
00:40:04,140 --> 00:40:08,010
a few proximation sets it
and lots of sensory issues,

612
00:40:08,011 --> 00:40:09,630
low body tone and so on my own,

613
00:40:09,720 --> 00:40:13,860
I'm actually on my stomach to be lower
than him and I'm doing exactly what he's

614
00:40:13,861 --> 00:40:14,694
doing.

615
00:40:17,310 --> 00:40:20,450
And so I give him exactly what he wants.
Um,

616
00:40:20,490 --> 00:40:23,520
but only when he gives me
something I don't keep giving.

617
00:40:23,521 --> 00:40:26,850
And then I go back to this and then
he looks up at me, does it get more?

618
00:40:29,120 --> 00:40:31,140
And,
and after a couple of times like that,

619
00:40:31,141 --> 00:40:36,141
I start to decrease my
party and give more words.

620
00:40:36,650 --> 00:40:39,540
He'll say, if more. And I said,
well, you're really like fast. Okay,

621
00:40:39,600 --> 00:40:43,170
here's more asbestosis pass.
Then I give them more.

622
00:40:43,590 --> 00:40:46,350
And at some point I did prompt
them. And this is only, you know,

623
00:40:46,351 --> 00:40:50,880
really within minutes this was happening.
First Time meeting him and I say,

624
00:40:50,881 --> 00:40:55,040
Johnny do fast and he's doing this
and it was really at the same pace but

625
00:40:55,080 --> 00:40:59,250
preempt a skirt strike. I say good,
fast, fast, fast, fast, fast, fast,

626
00:41:00,210 --> 00:41:04,980
fast. And he started doing fast and then
that same, it was a two hour session.

627
00:41:04,981 --> 00:41:09,270
Within that same tour session,
we ran fast, we jumped fast.

628
00:41:09,271 --> 00:41:14,271
So we took the concept of fast and we did
it in multiple activities for mastery.

629
00:41:16,200 --> 00:41:20,040
And then at some point we added slow to
activities where they were appropriate.

630
00:41:20,650 --> 00:41:22,830
You don't want it to be,
I still make it fun.

631
00:41:22,831 --> 00:41:26,850
And so if I do slow for certain
things, it's not so much fun. Um,

632
00:41:26,851 --> 00:41:29,460
so that he could start
discriminating between these things.

633
00:41:33,230 --> 00:41:33,980
Um,
be

634
00:41:33,980 --> 00:41:36,950
responsive. That's that. Thanking him.

635
00:41:37,340 --> 00:41:41,600
Everything you want to see out of a child,

636
00:41:41,601 --> 00:41:43,970
you want it to be clear what's expected.

637
00:41:43,971 --> 00:41:46,730
We can put that in our response,

638
00:41:46,880 --> 00:41:51,490
our thank you's and vary your
language. Again, make it fun.

639
00:41:51,510 --> 00:41:56,120
You want to keep that, that
value to it. So if I say, oh,
thank you for cleaning up.

640
00:41:56,150 --> 00:42:00,110
Oh, thank you for eating.
Oh, thank you for sharing.

641
00:42:00,290 --> 00:42:03,470
I'm going to be specific and say exactly
when I see more often because if a

642
00:42:03,471 --> 00:42:06,560
child gives me something, I say
thank you. I can assume he knows,

643
00:42:06,561 --> 00:42:09,180
but I don't want to assume I want to.

644
00:42:09,340 --> 00:42:11,870
What I'm really saying
is do that more often.

645
00:42:12,890 --> 00:42:16,730
Just like the kid who really didn't
do fast, but I said good fast. Right?

646
00:42:17,090 --> 00:42:20,600
I'm telling him it's fast before it is,
but what I'm really saying is faster,

647
00:42:20,690 --> 00:42:23,180
faster, more, more, more.

648
00:42:23,920 --> 00:42:28,490
But I'm building that confidence and I'm
showing that we're a team in this and

649
00:42:28,491 --> 00:42:31,310
so I can say thank you with
good energy and be specific,

650
00:42:31,311 --> 00:42:36,020
but it loses its value after awhile. Sick.
Thank you all the time, kind of boring.

651
00:42:36,840 --> 00:42:40,550
And you want to keep that value in that
kind of connection and doing things like,

652
00:42:40,580 --> 00:42:44,360
oh, there's those pretty eyes.
Get excited about that stuff.

653
00:42:44,570 --> 00:42:48,200
It also brings more energy as
you're doing these, you know,

654
00:42:48,201 --> 00:42:50,900
when you think how long
do I do the eye thing?

655
00:42:51,060 --> 00:42:55,580
Shouldn't he be giving me eye contact by
now if he's not, we keep reinforcing it.

656
00:42:56,530 --> 00:42:59,450
Um,
and we keep the party hi when needed.

657
00:42:59,451 --> 00:43:02,270
It's like when a child first starts
walking, right, we get really excited,

658
00:43:02,271 --> 00:43:03,021
you can do it.

659
00:43:03,021 --> 00:43:07,640
And we were kind of that big cheerleader
there and now that they have own

660
00:43:07,641 --> 00:43:10,100
walking, we don't have to
say anything more about it.

661
00:43:10,101 --> 00:43:11,600
We move on from those things.

662
00:43:12,200 --> 00:43:16,850
But we have to be that cheerleader in
that development of whatever skill you're

663
00:43:16,851 --> 00:43:19,670
looking at.
And you know,

664
00:43:19,790 --> 00:43:23,150
the thing about eye contact is cause
there's a lot of kids who don't have to

665
00:43:23,151 --> 00:43:25,700
look to take the information in.
However,

666
00:43:25,701 --> 00:43:29,990
at some point they're going to be missing
the more complicated stuff because

667
00:43:29,991 --> 00:43:33,680
they're not watching.
So we do need eye contact.

668
00:43:34,680 --> 00:43:36,020
Um, you know, we want the,

669
00:43:36,200 --> 00:43:40,620
certainly that receptive language that
follows it was very, very important. Um,

670
00:43:40,820 --> 00:43:42,890
but I'd hold them to
the eye contact as well.

671
00:43:47,990 --> 00:43:51,890
So finding teachable moments.
Those are just kind of some ideas.

672
00:43:51,891 --> 00:43:55,940
I'm going to move on for this
just to get to the next slide. Um,

673
00:43:56,240 --> 00:43:59,780
model functional language.
Again, be that good audience.

674
00:44:00,590 --> 00:44:03,950
The more you receive communication
was verbal or nonverbal,

675
00:44:04,040 --> 00:44:07,790
especially the nonverbal
to say back things even,

676
00:44:07,791 --> 00:44:10,970
but she child looks a little nervous about
something. I know it's a little scary,

677
00:44:10,971 --> 00:44:15,650
but I'm going to help you.
You could do it or hating haircuts,

678
00:44:15,651 --> 00:44:18,950
hating to get their hair washed,
brushing teeth or whatever.

679
00:44:18,951 --> 00:44:21,710
I know you don't like it.
It's okay. We can do it.

680
00:44:21,711 --> 00:44:25,700
And you kind of let them
know first. You know, first,

681
00:44:26,570 --> 00:44:29,750
you know, top teeth [inaudible]
Tepe than all down or something.

682
00:44:30,080 --> 00:44:33,400
I'll do the washing hair
and I'll say like, you know,

683
00:44:33,480 --> 00:44:36,000
five cups of water and then all done.
So I let them know,

684
00:44:36,090 --> 00:44:39,460
I estimate what it's
going to take and then I,

685
00:44:39,470 --> 00:44:43,440
I get it through and it's
not fun for the child.

686
00:44:44,070 --> 00:44:47,220
However they survive it. And for
some things, that's what we're doing.

687
00:44:47,221 --> 00:44:49,700
We don't want to tip tool around,
you know,

688
00:44:49,701 --> 00:44:53,450
it's anxiety provoking activities or,
or,

689
00:44:53,550 --> 00:44:56,610
or scary activities.
We want to help them through it.

690
00:44:56,611 --> 00:44:58,800
We want to be a partner and
say, no, it's a little scary,

691
00:44:58,801 --> 00:45:00,600
but when you think help you,

692
00:45:01,100 --> 00:45:04,770
we would do it together and
then we give them some success

693
00:45:06,450 --> 00:45:07,920
and then we move on to the next.

694
00:45:08,340 --> 00:45:13,200
We don't have to spend again a lot of
time explaining why they had to do it.

695
00:45:13,770 --> 00:45:18,770
We just want to help them be successful
and that in any given activity.

696
00:45:20,960 --> 00:45:25,560
Um, and, and what happens too is
over time it gets easier and easier,

697
00:45:27,150 --> 00:45:31,890
do less for the child, um, to
create openings. And again,

698
00:45:32,130 --> 00:45:36,060
I, it, it, especially for help of a
child needs help. And it's obvious to me,

699
00:45:36,510 --> 00:45:40,080
I am available and I'll put my
hands out and say, I'm right here.

700
00:45:40,080 --> 00:45:43,650
If you want help and I'll punch out
whatever word they should be saying,

701
00:45:43,651 --> 00:45:47,730
but I don't automatically
do. You know, I, I um,

702
00:45:47,940 --> 00:45:49,290
right there,
it's,

703
00:45:49,410 --> 00:45:53,040
I'm anticipating them giving me
something or asking me for help,

704
00:45:53,190 --> 00:45:56,460
but they do have to give to get.
And so for kids who don't have language,

705
00:45:56,461 --> 00:45:59,820
they might put the item in my
hand, I'll say yes, help, help.

706
00:46:00,240 --> 00:46:01,530
And I help for other kids,

707
00:46:01,531 --> 00:46:06,000
they might give me language to help or
for some I'm ready but they want to work

708
00:46:06,001 --> 00:46:09,600
on a little longer and I might get
a little reinforcement for that.

709
00:46:09,601 --> 00:46:13,860
And so your work, you're really
hard things, you know, again,

710
00:46:13,861 --> 00:46:18,390
just reinforcing the actions they are
demonstrating to me with functional

711
00:46:18,391 --> 00:46:21,000
language,
but keeping it really simple,

712
00:46:21,001 --> 00:46:23,250
no matter how much it
language a child has,

713
00:46:24,150 --> 00:46:27,900
I do a lot more gestures
than expansive language.

714
00:46:29,300 --> 00:46:30,133
Okay.

715
00:46:30,170 --> 00:46:34,180
Um, pause often you've
seen me do that. Um,

716
00:46:34,280 --> 00:46:37,070
it allows a child to give,
to get,

717
00:46:37,820 --> 00:46:42,260
it also allows them to read the situation
because at some point you want to be

718
00:46:42,261 --> 00:46:44,210
yells at Johnny and he looks at it

719
00:46:46,510 --> 00:46:49,630
and for follow through with things
like that. That's much more compliment,

720
00:46:49,660 --> 00:46:53,290
complicate that made us say,
Johnny, come over here, have a seat.

721
00:46:53,320 --> 00:46:55,060
I mean that's all first teach it,

722
00:46:55,360 --> 00:47:00,130
but across the room you want to be able
to go like this. That's a more subtle,

723
00:47:00,330 --> 00:47:05,020
a social language that
we all have to read. Um,

724
00:47:05,110 --> 00:47:09,100
demonstrate nice social emotional language
and problem solving skills. You know,

725
00:47:09,101 --> 00:47:12,940
it's really important for a child early
on to have social emotional language.

726
00:47:12,970 --> 00:47:15,850
And so we do,
we teach that by giving it to them.

727
00:47:16,210 --> 00:47:18,400
I know it's a little scary or oh,

728
00:47:18,410 --> 00:47:22,420
that you know that they're sad
or whatever and be that yourself.

729
00:47:22,421 --> 00:47:26,350
You don't always want to do
things perfectly. Have accidents.

730
00:47:26,351 --> 00:47:28,990
All have a little water and a cup.
And I'll purposely,

731
00:47:29,230 --> 00:47:32,530
it spilled for it depending on
the child and working at La.

732
00:47:33,070 --> 00:47:37,630
Oh well I'll clean it up. Right?
Accidents happen. But for some kids,

733
00:47:38,410 --> 00:47:41,860
you know, their social emotional
responses over the top.

734
00:47:43,330 --> 00:47:47,910
And so you want to have a
little bit of a reaction, uh,

735
00:47:48,080 --> 00:47:49,750
but then a problem solve the problem.

736
00:47:49,751 --> 00:47:52,180
You don't always want to go to solving
the problem and you think about it in

737
00:47:52,181 --> 00:47:56,890
your own life. If you came home
to your partner and said, oh,

738
00:47:56,900 --> 00:48:01,660
traffic was so bad, I can't stand
one on one, it's always packed.

739
00:48:01,661 --> 00:48:02,650
And they're like,
oh,

740
00:48:02,850 --> 00:48:07,240
why don't you take one on one every time
I tell you to go blah instead of one on

741
00:48:07,241 --> 00:48:10,600
one. You don't want a pro, you
don't want solution to that problem.

742
00:48:10,780 --> 00:48:14,170
You're aggravate it and you want someone
to meet you there and the aggravation

743
00:48:14,171 --> 00:48:18,160
and then you can let it go. But if
someone's always solving your problems,

744
00:48:18,640 --> 00:48:22,450
you're not going to really talk to
them about problems so much. Right?

745
00:48:22,870 --> 00:48:25,840
You just want to be matched
and then you can come down.

746
00:48:25,841 --> 00:48:28,270
And so even for kids who
do have big responses,

747
00:48:28,271 --> 00:48:31,900
I guess you all have experienced
this before. I'll match them in that,

748
00:48:31,901 --> 00:48:34,300
but then I can bring him down.
Like if it's frustration,

749
00:48:34,301 --> 00:48:38,950
I know it's so frustrating.
Hey, I have an idea, try this.

750
00:48:39,220 --> 00:48:42,090
Right? But if I don't
match them there, then I,

751
00:48:42,091 --> 00:48:45,670
I typically can't lead them
out of there. So, again,

752
00:48:45,671 --> 00:48:50,140
depending on what your work on.
Um, so have your own accidents.

753
00:48:50,170 --> 00:48:55,000
Try something and make it not work.
You know, doing household, uh,

754
00:48:55,001 --> 00:48:56,620
you know,
fixing things around your house.

755
00:48:56,621 --> 00:49:00,190
Kids love to try to do
screwdrivers or whatever.

756
00:49:00,220 --> 00:49:03,910
Act like you can't do it and asked for
their help and make it really simpler.

757
00:49:04,240 --> 00:49:08,680
Opening a water bottle, you
know, I'll purposely have
it loose. Can you, you know,

758
00:49:08,681 --> 00:49:10,030
and I'll ask for them to help me.

759
00:49:10,300 --> 00:49:13,360
And then they're able love when
you helped me write it, well,

760
00:49:13,361 --> 00:49:16,390
I already loosened it up. It's still, um,

761
00:49:16,420 --> 00:49:21,070
I make it so that I can't solve
everything. I can't do everything.

762
00:49:22,650 --> 00:49:25,870
And so that they can step into,
we all need those moments.

763
00:49:26,710 --> 00:49:30,300
Pair gestures with your
words, visuals, you know,

764
00:49:30,310 --> 00:49:35,140
gestures are so important.
And so if you're not an expressive person,

765
00:49:35,680 --> 00:49:38,470
you want to turn it on for those moments.

766
00:49:40,810 --> 00:49:42,280
Be Mindful teacher.

767
00:49:42,400 --> 00:49:46,390
You want to think about what
you're teaching and promote that,

768
00:49:46,391 --> 00:49:50,020
especially imitation through
demonstration. When we look at imitation,

769
00:49:51,390 --> 00:49:54,730
I don't think that's an it, but
we're looking at facial, um,

770
00:49:54,790 --> 00:49:58,660
Volkl gestural action with objects.

771
00:49:59,650 --> 00:50:03,400
Um, so you want to, and you want to think
about how they're doing, you know, as,

772
00:50:03,490 --> 00:50:07,240
as your child is developing at language,
is there a nice tone of voice?

773
00:50:08,200 --> 00:50:11,920
Are they owning that language?
Uh, you know, they are,

774
00:50:11,921 --> 00:50:16,480
they able to not only read, come
here, but they too will do come here.

775
00:50:17,080 --> 00:50:19,650
And you can especially teach that when
there's a couple of you. I, you know,

776
00:50:19,660 --> 00:50:21,190
daddy come here.
Well you have to show him,

777
00:50:21,250 --> 00:50:23,980
go do this and you can even do
a little here and I'll help you.

778
00:50:23,981 --> 00:50:28,160
And you do come here Daddy. And
then, yeah. And then Daddy, oh,

779
00:50:28,220 --> 00:50:30,980
thanks for showing me.
So again,

780
00:50:30,981 --> 00:50:33,560
you thank him for whatever you want the,

781
00:50:33,890 --> 00:50:38,390
the skill to improve on. So if
language is already there and you went,

782
00:50:38,391 --> 00:50:42,170
the gestural reinforced
that gesture by the showing,

783
00:50:43,550 --> 00:50:47,660
make expectations clear,
have that beginning, middle,

784
00:50:47,661 --> 00:50:52,070
and end to everything you're teaching
and stick with it for a few rounds until

785
00:50:52,071 --> 00:50:56,840
they're able to read it. It's a couple for
some kids, it's getting them to buy in,

786
00:50:56,990 --> 00:51:00,080
making it fun.
And I have to sell that fun.

787
00:51:00,110 --> 00:51:04,880
And so I keep doing it that same way
and that makes it really clear what it

788
00:51:04,881 --> 00:51:05,750
looks like.

789
00:51:05,751 --> 00:51:10,070
And for some other kids it's important
for them to observe it multiple times so

790
00:51:10,071 --> 00:51:14,420
they know what their role is.
If I want a child to do fast,

791
00:51:14,421 --> 00:51:16,520
what does it look like?
What does it sound like?

792
00:51:16,521 --> 00:51:19,580
I'm defining that word even as I say
it, right? Fast test, test, test, test.

793
00:51:19,850 --> 00:51:24,020
And probably my speed isn't like really
fast. It may not even change that much,

794
00:51:24,170 --> 00:51:26,330
but I'm calling it fast and um,

795
00:51:26,600 --> 00:51:30,680
the way I'm saying it's fast and
so I'm selling the fast concept.

796
00:51:31,520 --> 00:51:35,150
Um, and so it's really important
to make those expectations.

797
00:51:35,151 --> 00:51:38,630
I know you've seen that on a few slides
already, but we want them to step up,

798
00:51:39,890 --> 00:51:44,480
make sure it's clear, um, and
to support the follow through.

799
00:51:44,720 --> 00:51:49,340
So the same little boy, he would
have a bag and I would ask him to,

800
00:51:49,610 --> 00:51:53,180
heavy work is really good
for a kid. Most kids too. Um,

801
00:51:53,181 --> 00:51:56,600
and so I would have him bring the
bag inside and he would take the bag,

802
00:51:56,601 --> 00:52:01,250
but he would take a couple steps and
Linda kind of slip off his arm and I do a

803
00:52:01,251 --> 00:52:05,060
playful and obstruction and say,
wait, you know, to the door,

804
00:52:05,090 --> 00:52:08,240
but I already made the expectation
clear, you know, to bring it to the door.

805
00:52:08,990 --> 00:52:13,520
So whether it's groceries or whatever,
where do they have to carry it to,

806
00:52:13,521 --> 00:52:17,210
to the table, to the door,
whatever, have it very clear.

807
00:52:17,570 --> 00:52:21,710
And so I put it back on his arm and I
actually would held this arm up and said,

808
00:52:21,860 --> 00:52:25,940
you know, I'll help you. And we go to the
door with it. And I said, good, you know,

809
00:52:25,941 --> 00:52:28,580
good caring or good listening.
Um,

810
00:52:29,030 --> 00:52:33,050
and then he started to do an himself
after a couple times of me holding it to

811
00:52:33,051 --> 00:52:34,730
them cause I didn't,
I couldn't,

812
00:52:34,760 --> 00:52:39,760
it wasn't an activity that I could in
that short amount of time repeat over and

813
00:52:39,891 --> 00:52:43,280
over. He was getting there and I
just was having it carry to the door.

814
00:52:43,281 --> 00:52:45,410
So after a few visits of that,

815
00:52:45,830 --> 00:52:49,490
he knew that I was going to hold them
to it and he started doing it himself.

816
00:52:51,200 --> 00:52:54,100
Um, if needed, allow
for sensory input break.

817
00:52:54,100 --> 00:52:57,680
So if a kid's doing homework or whatever,

818
00:52:57,681 --> 00:53:01,840
and you see them moving a
little more good, put language
shoe that, oh, I know us,

819
00:53:01,850 --> 00:53:04,760
you're moving in your seat, or
your, your work's getting sloppy.

820
00:53:04,970 --> 00:53:09,620
How about we jump three times
and then try again? You know, or,

821
00:53:09,810 --> 00:53:14,480
um, a, but don't let them go watch TV or
do something that they're not coming back

822
00:53:14,481 --> 00:53:17,800
from. It's that sensory input.
It's that movement. You know,

823
00:53:18,080 --> 00:53:22,580
an article came out a few years ago now
and it was research showing that kids

824
00:53:22,581 --> 00:53:27,380
who sit on a bouncy ball
are more successful, um,

825
00:53:27,820 --> 00:53:31,230
in school, get higher grades,
doing homework on a bouncy ball.

826
00:53:31,830 --> 00:53:34,890
And so having that movement
can really help with focus,

827
00:53:34,891 --> 00:53:39,810
work and be animated.
You've seen that and there's your summary.

828
00:53:40,080 --> 00:53:44,220
So, sorry if I sped through that last
part, but it's to get to questions.

829
00:53:48,720 --> 00:53:52,500
Oh, I should just go right. Oh, there's
some resources at the end, by the way,

830
00:53:53,160 --> 00:53:57,720
including all these resources.
You can additionally get through a spa.

831
00:53:57,930 --> 00:54:01,800
And these Yahoo chat groups
for parents only, they vet it.

832
00:54:01,801 --> 00:54:03,120
Well it's parents only.

833
00:54:03,450 --> 00:54:06,830
You do not have to be on the peninsula
or Kaiser parents from all over.

834
00:54:06,850 --> 00:54:10,110
Different insurances are in both and
they're strong advocate parents who run

835
00:54:10,111 --> 00:54:10,950
those groups.

836
00:54:12,760 --> 00:54:16,870
Okay. Um, we do have some
time for questions and um,

837
00:54:16,900 --> 00:54:19,990
we'll take audience questions first and
we do have a microphone that will pass

838
00:54:19,991 --> 00:54:22,450
around for those questions.

839
00:54:24,940 --> 00:54:26,380
The audience questions.

840
00:54:30,720 --> 00:54:34,020
Okay. Too much information
over. I'll go to the dory.

841
00:54:34,630 --> 00:54:35,463
Thank you.

842
00:54:38,730 --> 00:54:42,750
Okay. So the first question on the Dory
is what would you recommend as effective

843
00:54:42,960 --> 00:54:45,630
methods for disciplining
children with autism?

844
00:54:46,640 --> 00:54:49,960
You know, it depends on
the child. Certainly. Um,

845
00:54:50,020 --> 00:54:53,500
you want to teach and get tilos yes.

846
00:54:53,501 --> 00:54:58,420
Sides as much as possible. And so
certainly, uh, you know, for some kids,

847
00:54:58,421 --> 00:55:01,480
timeout works given a
break. Well, you know,

848
00:55:01,481 --> 00:55:04,630
but having them try again is very,
very important.

849
00:55:05,440 --> 00:55:09,460
So if it's a child who pulls hair,

850
00:55:09,940 --> 00:55:10,510
you know,

851
00:55:10,510 --> 00:55:15,490
I used to run a center based program
and we had a little boy who would really

852
00:55:15,520 --> 00:55:18,280
want it to play with these other kids
and he'd pull the little girl's hair.

853
00:55:18,610 --> 00:55:23,470
And so teaching gentle hands,
oh you can say hi, you can pat.

854
00:55:23,471 --> 00:55:27,240
And so we were right there at
teach what he could do, um,

855
00:55:27,370 --> 00:55:32,110
with his hands to get that interaction
that we knew he wanted it. So you know,

856
00:55:32,350 --> 00:55:37,350
what is the purpose of that behavior
and then looking for the replacements,

857
00:55:39,370 --> 00:55:42,730
what are the yes in those,
because the know is pulling hair,

858
00:55:43,060 --> 00:55:44,470
explaining that to a child,

859
00:55:44,471 --> 00:55:47,290
why they can't pull hair and then the
friend won't want to play with them.

860
00:55:47,291 --> 00:55:52,030
And all of this, for most kids that's
not going to teach what should I do?

861
00:55:53,140 --> 00:55:56,380
And so teaching the, what should they
do? If you do a time out, you know,

862
00:55:56,381 --> 00:55:59,710
you can say, okay, we're going to, we're
going to take a break and then try again.

863
00:55:59,950 --> 00:56:03,040
Give them that opportunity to
try it again if it's at home,

864
00:56:03,520 --> 00:56:07,000
but then help them be
successful as they try it again.

865
00:56:08,810 --> 00:56:11,240
He went. Other Tory question. Um,

866
00:56:11,690 --> 00:56:15,890
are there any resources that you would
recommend for parents of older children

867
00:56:15,891 --> 00:56:19,220
who may not have the skill sets
initially to live on their own?

868
00:56:19,550 --> 00:56:24,370
Specifically about job life skill
training and resources as well as possible

869
00:56:24,371 --> 00:56:27,670
options such as group homes
or assisted living for adult?

870
00:56:28,770 --> 00:56:29,041
Um,

871
00:56:29,041 --> 00:56:34,041
so if you haven't contacted the
bay autism center in San Francisco,

872
00:56:35,461 --> 00:56:38,550
run by,
um,

873
00:56:38,670 --> 00:56:43,670
Jill Escher and she does a lot
of workshops as well or um,

874
00:56:44,751 --> 00:56:49,751
sh Jill usher is really is putting a lot
of time and effort resources into uh,

875
00:56:52,080 --> 00:56:54,180
older children,
individuals.

876
00:56:54,630 --> 00:56:59,400
You can also call [inaudible] an s
book and give you a lot more resources.

877
00:56:59,401 --> 00:57:02,650
If you want anything
specific, they can, um,

878
00:57:02,730 --> 00:57:05,940
give you contacts and you know,

879
00:57:06,000 --> 00:57:10,110
any information around
groups and all of that. Um,

880
00:57:10,140 --> 00:57:14,700
there's a lot of apps out there
that I know are being used. Again,

881
00:57:14,701 --> 00:57:19,290
if you call s she can kind of go over
some of those, uh, for work stuff

882
00:57:20,100 --> 00:57:20,933
as well.

883
00:57:21,240 --> 00:57:23,910
Okay. Any other audience
questions before we end?

884
00:57:25,630 --> 00:57:26,463
Okay.

885
00:57:26,490 --> 00:57:27,590
Your microphone's coming to you.

886
00:57:32,230 --> 00:57:32,540
Okay.

887
00:57:32,540 --> 00:57:32,781
Um,

888
00:57:32,781 --> 00:57:37,220
do you have any suggestions if your child
is a extremely food limiting as far as

889
00:57:37,221 --> 00:57:41,030
their choices, as far as things to
kind of get them to open up to, uh,

890
00:57:41,060 --> 00:57:42,050
to new foods and things?

891
00:57:43,270 --> 00:57:43,580
Uh,

892
00:57:43,580 --> 00:57:48,580
so that is certainly a hard one because
we get so scared of our kids not eating

893
00:57:49,700 --> 00:57:53,030
that we many times will give over.
I mean,

894
00:57:53,031 --> 00:57:55,800
and I know the specialists out there that,

895
00:57:55,850 --> 00:58:00,380
that work with food issues
have long wait list. Um,

896
00:58:00,500 --> 00:58:01,640
but a lot of,

897
00:58:01,820 --> 00:58:06,820
and certainly you can call
Espa and Christina can give
you some information and

898
00:58:07,731 --> 00:58:12,070
contact you with other people. Um,
there'd be no cost to it. Well we,

899
00:58:12,100 --> 00:58:16,130
we recently did a four s ba I did,

900
00:58:16,131 --> 00:58:20,790
I do parent groups as well. If you ever
want information on that, they're free to,

901
00:58:20,791 --> 00:58:25,280
to attend and you can do remote
and in person. And one was on food.

902
00:58:25,281 --> 00:58:27,920
And one of the tips that
this specialist gay,

903
00:58:27,921 --> 00:58:32,810
which I thought was really interesting
is if your child say, is eating bread,

904
00:58:33,440 --> 00:58:37,580
well you want to add just one thing that
compliments bread that you think will

905
00:58:37,581 --> 00:58:42,230
be acceptable, like butter. You don't want
it then say, okay, here's spinach, right?

906
00:58:42,500 --> 00:58:44,210
Whatever they are eating,

907
00:58:44,780 --> 00:58:49,610
you want something that actually goes
with that item to just get a different

908
00:58:49,611 --> 00:58:54,440
taste on the Palette, to just stretch them
up, different texture, different flavor,

909
00:58:54,730 --> 00:58:59,600
um, that would be acceptable
for them to try. Um, but if you,

910
00:58:59,660 --> 00:59:02,960
if you, um, I don't know
if my email's on here,

911
00:59:03,140 --> 00:59:04,850
I can send you the presentation.

912
00:59:04,851 --> 00:59:07,280
This individual did that
Hella nice tips in that too.

913
00:59:07,610 --> 00:59:08,810
I'll give you an email with really,

914
00:59:14,940 --> 00:59:19,260
do you have any recommendation for
when the kids start to act a silly,

915
00:59:19,320 --> 00:59:22,430
especially in they're
comfortable with the situation.

916
00:59:22,460 --> 00:59:26,000
Start like acting very
silly, very, very silly.

917
00:59:26,920 --> 00:59:31,400
And a lot of that is, uh, uh, you know,
some underlying anxiety. We see that as,

918
00:59:31,420 --> 00:59:35,870
or even being overstimulated.
So deep pressure helps with that.

919
00:59:36,260 --> 00:59:38,540
I would put language to it, say, you know,

920
00:59:39,260 --> 00:59:42,680
start to help them discriminate
when that's appropriate, when not,

921
00:59:43,430 --> 00:59:48,080
if it doesn't feel like a connection,
it probably is overstimulation, right?

922
00:59:48,650 --> 00:59:50,510
So depending on where you are,

923
00:59:50,511 --> 00:59:55,460
sometimes holding a some item that they
can give pressure squeeze, you know,

924
00:59:55,490 --> 00:59:59,060
those balls or whatever. Um, you know,

925
00:59:59,810 --> 01:00:03,860
we used to put a weight, the,
the avoid the ankle weights.

926
01:00:03,861 --> 01:00:07,070
You open those up and put it on a child's
lap and that will ground them a little

927
01:00:07,071 --> 01:00:10,730
bit. Their feet should always be
touching the ground to be grounded.

928
01:00:10,850 --> 01:00:11,900
If they're sitting in your chair,

929
01:00:11,901 --> 01:00:16,040
you don't want their feet dangling because
then they'd have no way of grounding

930
01:00:16,041 --> 01:00:21,041
themselves and they can kind
of start to get out of control.

931
01:00:21,970 --> 01:00:26,600
Um, if it's somewhere where you're sitting
and you can put them on their lap and

932
01:00:26,601 --> 01:00:30,350
give him some deep pressure
that can help, uh, just that PR,

933
01:00:30,830 --> 01:00:35,210
even weight pressure on the shoulders
to relax their body and ground them,

934
01:00:35,840 --> 01:00:39,650
but you want to hold and kind
of affirm hold and with, uh,

935
01:00:39,790 --> 01:00:43,460
not that grabbed squeeze consequence
that can work them up even higher.

936
01:00:43,730 --> 01:00:47,960
But just that like squeeze and hold and I,
I will,

937
01:00:47,961 --> 01:00:50,210
I won't break contact and I
will do the rule of three.

938
01:00:50,211 --> 01:00:54,170
So if I'm given a hug or something,
right for a child, they'll say, ah,

939
01:00:54,200 --> 01:00:55,490
and there's my beginning,
you know,

940
01:00:55,491 --> 01:00:59,780
hug and I get this nice deep
hug and then I will let up,

941
01:00:59,781 --> 01:01:01,820
but I don't break contact and
I'll do it the rule of three

942
01:01:04,610 --> 01:01:08,330
and I do it again and then I'll open up
and some kids will push back into me,

943
01:01:08,331 --> 01:01:12,410
I'll say more ugh.
And it's just to relax their body.

944
01:01:13,120 --> 01:01:17,330
Um, so that then we can have more focused
work or they can move on to something

945
01:01:17,331 --> 01:01:22,160
else. Deep squeezes in the
hand really help. And I mean,

946
01:01:22,161 --> 01:01:25,300
I get nice from school yet, and
again, I'll say she's queen.

947
01:01:26,000 --> 01:01:29,600
And so that's where time where
I won't be, you know, when we,

948
01:01:29,630 --> 01:01:34,550
when we talk about bringing that
energy, it's not being obnoxious, right?

949
01:01:35,240 --> 01:01:37,790
Cause I can do it with no words are,

950
01:01:39,080 --> 01:01:42,320
but for a child who's kind
of overstimulate, then yes,

951
01:01:42,321 --> 01:01:47,030
it's kind of lowering it and giving
that deep pressure, you know,

952
01:01:47,120 --> 01:01:51,710
kind of a whisper and con, let's try
squeeze is, and I'm always just trying.

953
01:01:52,460 --> 01:01:55,910
I don't know what's going to work.
I'm taking best guests and squeeze,

954
01:01:56,810 --> 01:02:00,110
and then I'm just relaxing their
body and then we try again.

955
01:02:00,140 --> 01:02:03,960
Whatever situation is okay, now
let's try to watch, you know,

956
01:02:04,070 --> 01:02:05,420
focus or whatever it is.

957
01:02:05,421 --> 01:02:10,250
And I'll use the word focus quite a bit
because we want focus during certain

958
01:02:10,251 --> 01:02:11,990
activities.
Yeah.

959
01:02:14,960 --> 01:02:18,750
Okay. Thank you so much. You
want to thank you for attending.
