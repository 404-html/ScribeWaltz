1
00:00:06,320 --> 00:00:11,320
[inaudible]

2
00:00:13,400 --> 00:00:15,380
good morning.
It's a pleasure to be here this morning.

3
00:00:15,381 --> 00:00:18,710
I've got to ask your indulgence on
two things. It's allergy season.

4
00:00:18,711 --> 00:00:23,390
So I have a real hard time during this
time of the year speaking and to, uh,

5
00:00:23,510 --> 00:00:26,900
most of the speaking I do when I walk
up to the podium is very technical.

6
00:00:26,901 --> 00:00:30,020
It deals with cyber crime
and identity theft, forgery,

7
00:00:30,021 --> 00:00:33,920
embezzlement and things of that nature.
I don't often talk about my life,

8
00:00:33,921 --> 00:00:35,600
but Google has asked me today,

9
00:00:35,630 --> 00:00:38,330
do something that different and
talk a little bit about my life.

10
00:00:38,331 --> 00:00:39,440
So I will do that.

11
00:00:39,800 --> 00:00:42,770
And then at the end of course I'll take
questions and those questions can be

12
00:00:42,771 --> 00:00:46,820
about any subject matter that
you like to ask. As you know,

13
00:00:46,821 --> 00:00:49,090
I've had a lot of people tell my story.

14
00:00:49,100 --> 00:00:52,550
I had a great movie director
write a film about my life.

15
00:00:52,551 --> 00:00:54,620
I had a great Broadway musical team,

16
00:00:54,621 --> 00:00:57,470
make a Tony Award winning
Broadway musical about my life,

17
00:00:57,471 --> 00:00:59,360
had a popular television show on TV,

18
00:00:59,361 --> 00:01:01,820
white collar for four years
curtain around my life.

19
00:01:02,330 --> 00:01:05,990
And most of those very creative people
have actually never met me personally,

20
00:01:07,100 --> 00:01:10,220
but they've enjoyed telling my
story from their point of view.

21
00:01:10,340 --> 00:01:13,730
So I thought it would take a few minutes
this morning and actually tell you the

22
00:01:13,731 --> 00:01:16,040
story from my point of view.

23
00:01:16,730 --> 00:01:20,390
I was raised just north of New York
City in Westchester County, New York.

24
00:01:20,391 --> 00:01:23,000
I was actually one of four
children in the family,

25
00:01:23,001 --> 00:01:24,920
the so called middle child or the form.

26
00:01:25,430 --> 00:01:28,910
I was educated there by the Christian
brothers of Ireland in a private Catholic

27
00:01:28,911 --> 00:01:32,600
school called Iona where I went to
school from kindergarten to high school.

28
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:36,440
By the time I had reached the
age of 16 in the 10th grade,

29
00:01:36,470 --> 00:01:40,700
my parents after 22 years of marriage
one day decided to get a divorce.

30
00:01:41,150 --> 00:01:43,970
Unlike most divorces where the children
were usually the first to know.

31
00:01:43,971 --> 00:01:46,700
My parents were very good
about keeping that a secret.

32
00:01:47,210 --> 00:01:50,300
I remember being in the 10th grade when
the father walked in the classroom one

33
00:01:50,301 --> 00:01:52,700
afternoon,
asked the brother to excuse me from class.

34
00:01:52,700 --> 00:01:53,840
When I came out in the hallway,

35
00:01:53,841 --> 00:01:57,440
the father handed me my books and told
me that one of the brothers would drive

36
00:01:57,441 --> 00:01:59,720
me to the county seat in white plains,
New York,

37
00:01:59,721 --> 00:02:03,380
where I would meet my parents and
they would explain what was going on.

38
00:02:03,890 --> 00:02:06,800
I remembered the brother dropped me at
the steps of a big stone building and

39
00:02:06,801 --> 00:02:09,980
told me to go on up the
steps in my parents would be
waiting for me in the lobby.

40
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:11,600
I remember climbing the steps,

41
00:02:11,601 --> 00:02:14,240
seeing a sign on the building
that said family court,

42
00:02:14,390 --> 00:02:17,940
but I really didn't understand what
that meant. When I arrived in the lobby,

43
00:02:17,970 --> 00:02:19,070
my parents were not there,

44
00:02:19,071 --> 00:02:22,160
but I was ushered into the back of an
immense courtroom where my parents were

45
00:02:22,161 --> 00:02:23,390
standing before a judge.

46
00:02:23,870 --> 00:02:27,050
I couldn't hear what the judge was
saying nor my parents' response,

47
00:02:27,830 --> 00:02:31,610
but eventually the judge saw me at the
back of the room and motioned me to

48
00:02:31,611 --> 00:02:34,700
approach the bench, so I walked
up to stand in between my parents.

49
00:02:35,150 --> 00:02:37,820
I remember distinctly that
the judge never looked at me.

50
00:02:38,060 --> 00:02:40,010
He never acknowledged
I was standing there.

51
00:02:40,250 --> 00:02:44,210
He simply read from his papers and said
that my parents were getting a divorce

52
00:02:44,630 --> 00:02:46,580
and because I was 16 years of age,

53
00:02:47,060 --> 00:02:50,360
I would need to tell the court
which parent I chose to live with.

54
00:02:50,990 --> 00:02:54,350
I started to cry,
so I turned and ran out of the courtroom,

55
00:02:54,650 --> 00:02:58,460
Judge Call for a 10 minute recess,
but by the time my parents got outside,

56
00:02:58,820 --> 00:02:59,653
I was gone.

57
00:02:59,980 --> 00:03:03,820
My mother never saw me again for about
seven years until I was a young adult.

58
00:03:03,850 --> 00:03:04,990
Contrary to the movie,

59
00:03:04,991 --> 00:03:09,991
my father never saw me wherever it spoke
to me again in the mid 1960s running

60
00:03:10,571 --> 00:03:12,610
away, it was very popular
thing for young people.

61
00:03:12,611 --> 00:03:15,400
A lot of them got caught up in
Haight Ashbury, the hippie scene,

62
00:03:15,401 --> 00:03:18,280
that drug scene instead, I
took a few, belongs in my home,

63
00:03:18,281 --> 00:03:22,120
packed them in a bag or did what was in
the new haven and Hartford railroad for

64
00:03:22,121 --> 00:03:25,360
the short train ride down to grand
central terminal in New York.

65
00:03:25,780 --> 00:03:28,300
My father did own the
stationery store in Manhattan.

66
00:03:28,301 --> 00:03:31,780
It was located on the corner of
40th and Madison. Like all of us.

67
00:03:31,781 --> 00:03:33,040
We had to work in that store.

68
00:03:33,041 --> 00:03:37,330
So from the time I was about 13 I made
deliveries from my dad in the summer on a

69
00:03:37,331 --> 00:03:39,460
bike.
I knew the city very well.

70
00:03:39,461 --> 00:03:42,550
So naturally I started looking
for the same type of work.

71
00:03:43,030 --> 00:03:46,900
There were a lot of signs on the windows
stock boy delivery boy part time.

72
00:03:47,170 --> 00:03:49,960
I'd walk in and apply. So tell
me young man, how old are you?

73
00:03:50,700 --> 00:03:54,850
16 how far did you go in high
school? 10th Grade, I'll hire you.

74
00:03:55,260 --> 00:03:58,030
And I went to work for a small
amount of money, a few hours a day.

75
00:03:58,750 --> 00:04:02,260
But as soon realized I couldn't
support myself on that amount of money.

76
00:04:02,440 --> 00:04:06,880
I also realized as long as people
believed I was 16 years old,

77
00:04:07,570 --> 00:04:11,860
they weren't going to pay me any more
money. At 16 I was six foot tall.

78
00:04:11,861 --> 00:04:13,390
I've always had a little gray hair.

79
00:04:13,570 --> 00:04:17,110
My friends in school used to say that
once a week when we dressed in a suit for

80
00:04:17,111 --> 00:04:21,850
mass, I look more like a teacher. So I
decided to lie about my age in New York.

81
00:04:21,851 --> 00:04:25,810
We had a driver's license at 16 back then.
It didn't have a photo on it,

82
00:04:25,811 --> 00:04:30,070
just an IBM card. So I altered
one digit and my date of birth,

83
00:04:30,550 --> 00:04:34,030
I was actually born in April
of 1948 but I dropped the four,

84
00:04:34,031 --> 00:04:37,780
converted it to a three and
that made me 26 years old.

85
00:04:38,110 --> 00:04:40,600
I walked around applying
for the same type of work.

86
00:04:40,601 --> 00:04:43,030
People gave me a little more money,
few more hours,

87
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:46,030
but even then it was very
difficult to make ends meet.

88
00:04:46,510 --> 00:04:49,450
One of the few things I had taken
when I left home was a checkbook.

89
00:04:49,450 --> 00:04:53,140
I had money from work on the summers.
I had some money in that checking account.

90
00:04:53,350 --> 00:04:56,770
So every so often I would write
a check to supplement my income.

91
00:04:56,800 --> 00:05:00,910
$20 $25 the funds were there,
the checks were good,

92
00:05:01,300 --> 00:05:05,080
but it was my friends, my peers who
would constantly say to me, you know,

93
00:05:05,260 --> 00:05:08,320
you're the only guy. No walks into
a bank in the middle of Manhattan.

94
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:12,730
You have no account there you don't know
is so you talked to somebody behind a

95
00:05:12,731 --> 00:05:17,170
desk and they okay or check, oh
my checks are good. You have it.

96
00:05:17,171 --> 00:05:20,800
If I walked in there, they wouldn't
touch my cheque. You walk in there,

97
00:05:21,160 --> 00:05:22,720
they don't bat an eye.
I,

98
00:05:22,721 --> 00:05:25,840
years later reporters would write and
speculate and say that that was my

99
00:05:25,841 --> 00:05:28,990
upbringing, mannerisms, dress,
appearance, speech, whatever it was.

100
00:05:28,991 --> 00:05:32,410
It was very easy to do. So
consequently, when the money right now,

101
00:05:32,590 --> 00:05:36,010
I kept writing those checks. Of
course, the checks started to balance.

102
00:05:36,011 --> 00:05:38,110
Please started looking
for me as a runaway,

103
00:05:38,230 --> 00:05:41,770
so I thought maybe it was a good time
to start thinking about leaving New York

104
00:05:41,771 --> 00:05:46,090
City, but I was quite apprehensive
about going to Chicago or Miami,

105
00:05:46,110 --> 00:05:47,530
one that if they cash in New York,

106
00:05:47,531 --> 00:05:51,610
check on a New York driver's license
in Miami as quickly as they did in

107
00:05:51,611 --> 00:05:55,270
Manhattan. I was walking at
42nd street when afternoon,

108
00:05:55,271 --> 00:05:59,930
about five o'clock in the evening, 16
years old, pondering all of these things.

109
00:05:59,931 --> 00:06:03,260
When I started to approach the front
door of an old hotel that used to be,

110
00:06:03,261 --> 00:06:06,710
they're called the Commodore
Hotel now the Grand Hyatt,

111
00:06:07,130 --> 00:06:11,150
just as I was about to get to the front
door of the hotel out stepped in eastern

112
00:06:11,151 --> 00:06:13,580
airline flight crew onto the sidewalk.

113
00:06:13,910 --> 00:06:17,090
I couldn't help but notice the captain
and the copilot, the flight engineer,

114
00:06:17,091 --> 00:06:20,390
about three or four flight attendants
dragging their bags to the curb to load

115
00:06:20,391 --> 00:06:23,720
them in the van to take them to
the airport as they loaded the van.

116
00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:27,410
I thought to myself, that's
it. I could pose as a pilot,

117
00:06:27,830 --> 00:06:29,780
I could travel all over
the world for free.

118
00:06:30,170 --> 00:06:34,310
I probably could get just about anybody
anywhere to cash a check for me.

119
00:06:34,700 --> 00:06:37,730
So I walked up the street a
little further to 42nd and park.

120
00:06:37,731 --> 00:06:40,430
I went to cross over,
I heard a huge helicopter.

121
00:06:40,700 --> 00:06:44,330
So I looked up and there was New York
Airways landing on the roof for the Pan Am

122
00:06:44,331 --> 00:06:46,940
building Pan Am the nation's flag carrier.

123
00:06:46,941 --> 00:06:51,200
The airline that flew around the world.
I thought, what a perfect airline to use.

124
00:06:51,560 --> 00:06:55,160
So the next day I placed a phone call
to the executive corporate offices,

125
00:06:55,161 --> 00:06:58,490
a pan n. I remember distinctly
when the phone was ringing,

126
00:06:58,491 --> 00:07:03,491
I had absolutely no idea what I was going
to say when they answered Panamerican

127
00:07:03,710 --> 00:07:07,790
Airlines. Good morning. Going to help
you now. Yes ma'am. I'd like to. Um,

128
00:07:08,420 --> 00:07:13,220
I'd like to speak to somebody
in the purchasing department
purchasing one moment

129
00:07:13,490 --> 00:07:17,630
and the clerk came on and see us and maybe
can help me. My name is, uh, John Black.

130
00:07:17,631 --> 00:07:20,660
I'm a copilot with the company
based out of San Francisco.

131
00:07:20,910 --> 00:07:22,730
Been with the company about seven years,

132
00:07:22,731 --> 00:07:26,750
but never had anything like this come
up before. But what's the problem? Well,

133
00:07:26,751 --> 00:07:30,470
we flew at chip in here yesterday.
We're going out later today. I,

134
00:07:30,471 --> 00:07:34,040
yesterday I sent in my uniform out
through the hotel to have it dry clean.

135
00:07:34,340 --> 00:07:37,340
Now the hotel and the cleaners
said they can't find it. Yeah,

136
00:07:37,341 --> 00:07:41,750
I'm with a flight and about four hours,
new uniform. And you have a spare uniform?

137
00:07:42,060 --> 00:07:44,150
Certainly back home in San Francisco,

138
00:07:44,151 --> 00:07:46,370
but I never get it here at
the time from my flight.

139
00:07:46,850 --> 00:07:50,330
I do understand this will cost you
the price of uniform, not the company,

140
00:07:50,660 --> 00:07:54,500
but I understand. Hold on, I'll be
right back. He came back and said,

141
00:07:54,501 --> 00:07:58,580
my supervisor says you need to go down
to the well bill uniform company on Fifth

142
00:07:58,581 --> 00:08:01,970
Avenue. There are supplier, I'll call
them and let them know you're on your way.

143
00:08:02,030 --> 00:08:03,650
Well,
that's exactly what I wanted to know.

144
00:08:03,651 --> 00:08:08,240
So I went down to the well bill uniform
company, Little Fella, Mr Rosen,

145
00:08:08,460 --> 00:08:12,800
me out in the uniform, that black
Gabardine three gold stripes on the arm.

146
00:08:12,801 --> 00:08:16,190
I certainly looked old enough to be
the pilot when he was all done. I said,

147
00:08:16,191 --> 00:08:19,910
how much do owe you but the
uniforms? $286 said, no problem.

148
00:08:19,911 --> 00:08:24,260
I'll write you a check. No,
we can't take any checks.

149
00:08:24,470 --> 00:08:28,790
Oh well then I'll um, I'll just pay
you cash and we can't accept cash.

150
00:08:28,820 --> 00:08:31,730
You need to fill out this computer card.
Then it needs boxes.

151
00:08:31,731 --> 00:08:32,840
Put your employee number.

152
00:08:33,230 --> 00:08:36,890
Then we build this back on the uniform
allowance comes out of the annex pain and

153
00:08:36,891 --> 00:08:39,290
paycheck, but that's even
better. Go ahead and do that.

154
00:08:41,030 --> 00:08:43,580
New York had two airports,
Laguardia and Kennedy.

155
00:08:43,580 --> 00:08:45,380
Laguardia was 20 minutes from Manhattan.

156
00:08:45,381 --> 00:08:48,710
Kennedy was 50 naturally Laguardia
being the closer of the two.

157
00:08:48,711 --> 00:08:49,544
That's where I went.

158
00:08:49,910 --> 00:08:53,030
I spent most of the morning walking
around Laguardia in the uniform,

159
00:08:53,031 --> 00:08:55,190
trying to figure out,
now that I had this uniform,

160
00:08:55,350 --> 00:08:58,980
how the hell do you get on these planes?
I got a little hungry.

161
00:08:58,981 --> 00:09:02,340
So about lunch time I walked into the
luncheonette and the terminal sat down

162
00:09:02,341 --> 00:09:05,540
with the counter on the stool in
order to sandwich moments Seder,

163
00:09:05,560 --> 00:09:09,180
a twa crew walked in,
the flight attendant sat in the booth,

164
00:09:09,181 --> 00:09:12,900
but the pilots up at the counter on either
side of me and captain right next to

165
00:09:12,901 --> 00:09:16,020
me. Now back before
deregulation of the airlines,

166
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:19,230
airline people thought of
themselves as just one big family.

167
00:09:19,470 --> 00:09:21,750
So they didn't hesitate a
moment to talk to each other.

168
00:09:21,751 --> 00:09:25,680
And the captain kind of leaned over.
A young man as Pan Am doing,

169
00:09:26,250 --> 00:09:29,550
doing just fine. Captain, tell me what's
Pan Am doing out here to Laguardia.

170
00:09:29,580 --> 00:09:33,840
Panim doesn't fly into Laguardia.
They only fly into Kennedy. Well,

171
00:09:33,841 --> 00:09:38,270
I picked up on that right
away. Yeah, we came into,

172
00:09:38,280 --> 00:09:41,250
Kennedy had a layover, so I came over
to visit some friends. Matter of fact,

173
00:09:41,280 --> 00:09:44,040
I'm on my way back to
Kennedy now. So tell me, man,

174
00:09:44,041 --> 00:09:47,670
what type of equipment or your arm or
airline people have a lot of jargon for

175
00:09:47,671 --> 00:09:50,640
things and one of them is they never
call a Planar planar and aircraft.

176
00:09:51,090 --> 00:09:53,430
They call it equipment.
And what type of equipment you're I'm in.

177
00:09:53,431 --> 00:09:55,080
What type of plane do you fly back then?

178
00:09:55,081 --> 00:09:58,260
The DCA at seven oh seven of
course I didn't know that.

179
00:09:58,261 --> 00:10:02,290
And I thought type of equipment,
equipment.

180
00:10:02,310 --> 00:10:06,180
Amman is this stool, they must mean
what type of equipment is on the planes.

181
00:10:06,181 --> 00:10:09,840
I've fly. So I thought, well, they've
got the wings, they've got the engine.

182
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:13,560
It always had a sticker on the engine
who manufactured the engines. So I said,

183
00:10:13,561 --> 00:10:14,550
yeah,
it's General Electric.

184
00:10:14,700 --> 00:10:17,970
All three pilots kind of just stopped
eating and leaned over and he,

185
00:10:17,971 --> 00:10:20,420
Kevin said a really,
what do you fly washing machines?

186
00:10:20,420 --> 00:10:22,500
So I knew I said the wrong
thing out the door. I went,

187
00:10:23,730 --> 00:10:27,570
everybody had an airline ID card,
a plastic laminated card,

188
00:10:27,571 --> 00:10:30,690
much like a driver's license today.
Yet without the ID card,

189
00:10:30,840 --> 00:10:34,560
the uniform was worthless. I went back to
Manhattan, pretty discouraged thinking,

190
00:10:34,561 --> 00:10:38,040
where would I come up with a Pan
American airline corporate ID.

191
00:10:38,610 --> 00:10:42,190
I was sitting in the hotel room. I noticed
a big thick Manhattan yellow pages.

192
00:10:42,191 --> 00:10:43,530
So I pulled them down on the bed,

193
00:10:43,531 --> 00:10:46,500
flipped them open and looked
under the word identification.

194
00:10:46,950 --> 00:10:50,220
There were three or four pages of
companies who made convention badges,

195
00:10:50,221 --> 00:10:53,490
metal badges, plastic badges,
police badge. It's fire badges.

196
00:10:53,491 --> 00:10:56,910
Started to call around and finally
when companies said, listen,

197
00:10:56,911 --> 00:11:00,390
most of those airline ids
manufactured by Polaroid,

198
00:11:00,570 --> 00:11:04,620
three M company B to call one of them
finally got the three m company on the

199
00:11:04,621 --> 00:11:05,840
phone in Manhattan.
You know,

200
00:11:05,850 --> 00:11:10,850
we manufacture paintings identification
system along with a number of other

201
00:11:10,921 --> 00:11:15,360
carriers. How come? So tell you, I'm a
purchasing officer for a major US carrier.

202
00:11:15,660 --> 00:11:18,960
I'm in New York just for the day, or
we're getting ready to expand our routes.

203
00:11:18,961 --> 00:11:21,210
Are a lot of new employees
go to a formal id.

204
00:11:21,630 --> 00:11:23,970
We're very impressed with
this Pam format when that,

205
00:11:23,971 --> 00:11:26,040
if I came by our office
this afternoon briefly,

206
00:11:26,041 --> 00:11:29,250
we could discuss quantity and
price by all means come on by.

207
00:11:29,550 --> 00:11:32,370
So I went by a dressed in a suit and the
sales were up. Opened the book. Yeah,

208
00:11:32,371 --> 00:11:37,371
we do United Braniff national Pan Am Pan
Am we'd like this Pan Am format when if

209
00:11:39,001 --> 00:11:41,640
you have a sample I could bring
back. Sure, I'll be right back.

210
00:11:41,970 --> 00:11:45,870
And he brought me back a five by seven
glossy piece of paper with a picture of

211
00:11:45,871 --> 00:11:50,010
an ID card blown up in the middle of it.
Someone else's picture in the picture.

212
00:11:50,310 --> 00:11:53,680
John Doe for a name and in
boulder I think across the front.

213
00:11:53,681 --> 00:11:55,960
This is a sample only. I said, no,

214
00:11:55,961 --> 00:11:59,270
I'm afraid this one to you and I need
to bring back an actual physical card.

215
00:11:59,271 --> 00:12:01,960
And by the way,
what is all this equipment on the floor?

216
00:12:02,170 --> 00:12:05,930
And we don't just sell these cards. We
sell the system camera laminator. I, oh,

217
00:12:05,960 --> 00:12:08,950
we have to buy all this.
Absolutely. But tell you what,

218
00:12:08,951 --> 00:12:09,880
since we have to buy it all,

219
00:12:09,881 --> 00:12:12,340
why don't we just demonstrate
how it works and use me fine.

220
00:12:12,341 --> 00:12:14,200
I have a say right here.
Take my picture.

221
00:12:17,230 --> 00:12:19,270
I was going down the
elevator studying the card.

222
00:12:19,271 --> 00:12:23,350
It had a blue board or across the top
that a half inch in Pan Am's colored blue

223
00:12:23,351 --> 00:12:27,430
but not a single thing on the card.
Said Pan-am, no logo, no insignia,

224
00:12:27,700 --> 00:12:31,360
no company name. This is a
plastic card, like a credit card.

225
00:12:31,361 --> 00:12:34,270
So you couldn't type on it, couldn't
ride on it, couldn't print on it,

226
00:12:34,750 --> 00:12:36,400
discouraged to put it in my pocket.

227
00:12:36,650 --> 00:12:39,400
Headed back to the hotel
and there was walking back,

228
00:12:39,401 --> 00:12:43,090
I noticed that I had passed the hobby
shop so I turned around and walked back.

229
00:12:43,180 --> 00:12:45,340
Excuse me sir. I've seen,
so a lot of models here.

230
00:12:45,470 --> 00:12:48,550
If some models of commercial
jetliners sure. Over there.

231
00:12:48,940 --> 00:12:51,940
And I bought a model of a Pan
Am seven oh seven cargo jet,

232
00:12:52,270 --> 00:12:54,940
took it back to my room,
open the box through all the parts out,

233
00:12:54,941 --> 00:12:57,250
but they're at the bottom of
the box was a sheet of decals,

234
00:12:57,280 --> 00:12:59,890
one on the model and when
soaked in a glass of water,

235
00:12:59,891 --> 00:13:03,640
the Little Pan and blue globe that we're
doing on the tail of the plastic plane

236
00:13:03,820 --> 00:13:07,530
when perfect up at the top of the plastic
card and the word Pan Am and there's

237
00:13:07,531 --> 00:13:09,960
special styling of graphics,
it would've went on the future.

238
00:13:09,970 --> 00:13:13,930
Lodgement perfect across the top of the
card and it clear decal on the laminated

239
00:13:13,931 --> 00:13:16,900
plastic made a beautiful
identification card.

240
00:13:17,290 --> 00:13:22,290
Pay An amp says they estimate that
between the ages of 16 and 18 I flew more

241
00:13:23,260 --> 00:13:27,040
than a million miles for free board and
more than 260 commercial aircraft and

242
00:13:27,041 --> 00:13:30,130
more than 26 countries around the world.
Pan Am's is,

243
00:13:30,131 --> 00:13:33,610
keep in mind the fact that frank having
Neil didn't impact poses one of our

244
00:13:33,611 --> 00:13:35,320
pilots for a long period of time.

245
00:13:35,560 --> 00:13:39,700
He never once stepped on board
one of our aircraft. That's true.

246
00:13:40,150 --> 00:13:43,480
I never flew on Pan Am because I was
afraid. Someone might say to me, you know,

247
00:13:43,481 --> 00:13:46,210
I'm based in San Francisco,
been out there 16 years.

248
00:13:46,570 --> 00:13:49,270
I don't recall ever meeting you before.
Or someone might say,

249
00:13:49,271 --> 00:13:52,750
you know your ID card,
it's not exactly like my id card.

250
00:13:53,110 --> 00:13:57,250
So instead I flew on everyone else.
If I wanted to go somewhere,

251
00:13:57,280 --> 00:14:01,000
I literally just walked out to the
airport, walked up on the board,

252
00:14:01,030 --> 00:14:03,190
United flight 800 to Chicago.

253
00:14:03,250 --> 00:14:06,880
Then I went downstairs to the
door marked United operations in,

254
00:14:06,881 --> 00:14:10,000
walked in the operations clerk,
hey Pam,

255
00:14:10,230 --> 00:14:13,840
can we do for you if you want to have
to jump seats open on 800 needed it in

256
00:14:13,850 --> 00:14:17,860
Chicago, opened this evening like get
a pink slip pass. I'd give him my id,

257
00:14:17,861 --> 00:14:20,590
right Matt, a pass. I'd walk out,
hand it to the flight attendant.

258
00:14:20,591 --> 00:14:24,160
She'd opened the door to the cockpit
and I'd step in and a captain,

259
00:14:24,161 --> 00:14:27,540
a copilot of flight engineering to seat
behind the captain called the jumpseat

260
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:32,170
where pilots deadhead on company time
because pilots love to talk shop.

261
00:14:32,350 --> 00:14:33,880
Once you picked up that jargon,

262
00:14:33,910 --> 00:14:38,350
it was the same conversation over and
over and over. So I just step our mod.

263
00:14:38,380 --> 00:14:41,350
Even Gen Bob Davis be run
in Chicago on the taxi out.

264
00:14:41,351 --> 00:14:45,070
Oh is the same questions about how long
you've been with Pan Am been flying

265
00:14:45,071 --> 00:14:48,100
about seven years or position.
You fly right seat,

266
00:14:48,190 --> 00:14:50,560
which is airline terminology for copilot.

267
00:14:50,830 --> 00:14:53,930
What of equipment we on had that one down.
Perfect.

268
00:14:55,520 --> 00:14:57,050
Matter of fact,
whatever they flew,

269
00:14:57,110 --> 00:15:00,980
I didn't fly so no problems with
that and we'd arrive in Chicago.

270
00:15:00,981 --> 00:15:02,810
I'd go by the Pan Am ticket counter,

271
00:15:02,811 --> 00:15:06,140
but just enough to get the attention of
the passenger service Rep. Excuse me,

272
00:15:06,141 --> 00:15:08,830
I haven't laid over here and over a
year it was still at the apartment house

273
00:15:08,831 --> 00:15:11,250
opened downtown, catch crew
bus, low level door, three out.

274
00:15:11,570 --> 00:15:12,770
I go down the Palmer House,

275
00:15:12,771 --> 00:15:16,910
Hilton Walk in and on the corner of the
registration desk was a little sign said

276
00:15:16,911 --> 00:15:20,150
airline cruise. That was a
three ring binder you signed in,

277
00:15:20,151 --> 00:15:23,240
referenced your flight number,
showed your Id. They'd give me a key,

278
00:15:23,241 --> 00:15:26,630
I'd stay two or three days in pain and
would be direct billed from my room and

279
00:15:26,631 --> 00:15:27,464
my meals.

280
00:15:27,830 --> 00:15:31,280
I also could cash a personal check at
the front desk because I was an employee

281
00:15:31,281 --> 00:15:31,820
of the airline.

282
00:15:31,820 --> 00:15:35,390
The airline had a contract with the hotel
and as a courtesy that cash your check.

283
00:15:35,750 --> 00:15:39,530
But then I found out that every airline
honors every other airline employees,

284
00:15:39,531 --> 00:15:40,400
personal check,

285
00:15:40,401 --> 00:15:45,401
actually a reciprocal agreements still
practice today in 2017 so at the San

286
00:15:45,920 --> 00:15:49,130
Francisco airport at Delta
flight attending can walk
up to an American airline

287
00:15:49,131 --> 00:15:54,131
ticket counter show her ID and Cassia
personal checkup to $100 and vice versa.

288
00:15:54,740 --> 00:15:58,190
Of course, when I found that out,
I'd go out to JFK or lax or me,

289
00:15:58,191 --> 00:16:01,540
I'd go to everybody in northeast
and national KLM air gram.

290
00:16:01,850 --> 00:16:05,240
It would take me a good
eight hours stopping at every
counter and every building.

291
00:16:05,450 --> 00:16:07,760
By the time I got all the way
around the other end of the airport,

292
00:16:07,761 --> 00:16:09,170
at least eight hours have gone by.

293
00:16:09,171 --> 00:16:11,570
And what did you have an eight
hours shift change new people.

294
00:16:11,571 --> 00:16:15,860
So I go all the way back around
the other way. As you know,

295
00:16:15,861 --> 00:16:19,160
I went on to impersonate a doctrine,
the Georgia hospital for a while.

296
00:16:19,490 --> 00:16:22,370
I took the bar exams in Louisiana,
passed the bar,

297
00:16:22,371 --> 00:16:26,410
went to work for attorney general pf
Grameen on the Civil Division of the State

298
00:16:26,410 --> 00:16:30,140
Court where I spent about
a year of practicing law in
both the job as the lawyer

299
00:16:30,170 --> 00:16:32,450
and the doctor.
No one ever doubted for a second.

300
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:36,440
I was not eligible or qualified to do so.
I on my own,

301
00:16:36,620 --> 00:16:40,190
resigned and moved on. Of
course, like any criminal,

302
00:16:40,191 --> 00:16:43,610
sooner or later you get caught and
I was no exception to that rule.

303
00:16:43,611 --> 00:16:47,720
I was actually arrested just once in
my life when I was 21 years old by the

304
00:16:47,721 --> 00:16:51,650
French police in a small town in
southern France called Mum Pa.

305
00:16:52,130 --> 00:16:55,730
The French police were actually arresting
me on an Interpol warrant issued by

306
00:16:55,731 --> 00:16:58,880
the Swedish police who are looking
for me for forgery and Sweden,

307
00:16:58,881 --> 00:17:02,630
but believed that I was living in France
when the French authorities took me

308
00:17:02,631 --> 00:17:06,560
into custody on that warrant.
They realized I had forged
checks all over France.

309
00:17:06,561 --> 00:17:10,460
So they refused to honor the warrant and
Sweden's requests from my extradition.

310
00:17:10,970 --> 00:17:14,270
They later convicted me at forgery
and sent me to French prison.

311
00:17:14,840 --> 00:17:17,240
I served my time and a place
called the maids on Dra,

312
00:17:17,270 --> 00:17:18,920
the house of arrest in a small town,

313
00:17:18,940 --> 00:17:23,000
southern France called Pepin young
Steven Spielberg, tow Barbara Walters.

314
00:17:23,030 --> 00:17:28,030
It was extremely important to me to go
back to that sell to the exact cell he

315
00:17:28,851 --> 00:17:33,620
was in and reconstruct it according to
the log books during his stay there,

316
00:17:34,010 --> 00:17:37,430
he said, to my amazement, that was
a blanket on the floor. No mattress,

317
00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:42,100
a hole in the floor to go to the bathroom,
no plumbing, no electricity. Instead,

318
00:17:42,140 --> 00:17:45,800
according to the log books,
I entered the prison at 198 pounds,

319
00:17:46,070 --> 00:17:50,610
left the prison at 109 pounds.
When sentence was over in France,

320
00:17:50,611 --> 00:17:54,480
I was extradited to Sweden where I was
later convicted of forgery in a Swedish

321
00:17:54,481 --> 00:17:58,770
court of law and essentially the
Swedish penitentiary in Malmo, Sweden.

322
00:17:59,400 --> 00:18:03,360
When my prison term was up in Sweden, US
federal authorities took custody of man,

323
00:18:03,361 --> 00:18:05,070
returned me to the United States,

324
00:18:05,130 --> 00:18:08,070
eventually ignited states
federal judge in Atlanta,

325
00:18:08,071 --> 00:18:12,120
Georgia would sentence me to
12 years in federal prison.

326
00:18:12,690 --> 00:18:16,830
I served four of the 12 years at a
federal prison in Petersburg, Virginia.

327
00:18:17,400 --> 00:18:18,840
When I was 26 years old,

328
00:18:18,841 --> 00:18:22,320
the government offered to take me out
of prison on the condition I go to work

329
00:18:22,321 --> 00:18:26,240
with an agency of the federal government
for the remainder of my sentence or

330
00:18:26,250 --> 00:18:28,920
until my parole had been
satisfactorily completed.

331
00:18:29,370 --> 00:18:32,340
I agreed and was released this year.

332
00:18:32,341 --> 00:18:35,010
I'm celebrating 41 years at the FBI.

333
00:18:35,220 --> 00:18:39,990
I've been at the bureau for more than
four decades. I work out of Washington DC.

334
00:18:40,410 --> 00:18:43,260
I actually make my home in Charleston,
South Carolina,

335
00:18:43,290 --> 00:18:47,220
so every Monday I fly up to Washington
about an hour of flight and I go home on

336
00:18:47,490 --> 00:18:48,390
Thursday evenings.

337
00:18:48,810 --> 00:18:52,590
I live in Charleston with my one
and only wife of 40 plus years,

338
00:18:52,800 --> 00:18:54,030
and my three sons,

339
00:18:54,570 --> 00:18:57,690
my youngest boy graduated from the
University of Beijing in China.

340
00:18:57,690 --> 00:19:00,060
He went on to get his master's
degree there. He reads,

341
00:19:00,061 --> 00:19:01,740
writes and speaks Chinese fluently.

342
00:19:02,130 --> 00:19:06,570
He works for a San Francisco
Gaming Company called Glu
Mobile. He designs gaming,

343
00:19:06,610 --> 00:19:08,940
uh,
games for the Chinese market.

344
00:19:08,970 --> 00:19:12,810
All of his games are in
Chinese and they're in their
fourth generation as mobile

345
00:19:12,811 --> 00:19:13,980
games and devices.

346
00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:17,400
My middle son graduated from
University of Nevada and Las Vegas.

347
00:19:17,401 --> 00:19:18,600
His degree was in business.

348
00:19:18,601 --> 00:19:23,370
He and his wife graduated together
and he and her own a business in South

349
00:19:23,370 --> 00:19:24,990
Carolina and they manage
that business together.

350
00:19:25,590 --> 00:19:28,710
My oldest son graduated from
University of Kansas at k. You,

351
00:19:28,711 --> 00:19:31,650
he went on to Loyola School of law
in Chicago to get his law degree,

352
00:19:31,651 --> 00:19:34,650
passed the bar in Illinois and went
on to make his dad very, very proud.

353
00:19:34,651 --> 00:19:38,070
He's an FBI agent.
He's been in the bureau about 12 years.

354
00:19:38,071 --> 00:19:42,180
He supervises a team that deals with
American citizens, kidnapped overseas.

355
00:19:42,181 --> 00:19:46,050
So their response team that
operates out of Quantico, Virginia.

356
00:19:46,710 --> 00:19:50,040
As many of you know, I had very
little to do with the film. Um,

357
00:19:50,190 --> 00:19:52,830
I would have preferred not to
had a movie made about my life.

358
00:19:52,831 --> 00:19:55,050
I actually raise my three boys in Tulsa,

359
00:19:55,051 --> 00:19:58,290
Oklahoma in the same house for 25 years.

360
00:19:58,320 --> 00:20:03,210
My neighbors had no idea who I was and
I would have preferred it stayed that

361
00:20:03,211 --> 00:20:05,580
way.
But Steven Spielberg told Barbara Walters,

362
00:20:05,640 --> 00:20:09,960
he felt compelled to tell the world
the story, not because of what I did,

363
00:20:09,990 --> 00:20:13,500
but because of what I'd done with my life.
After that,

364
00:20:13,740 --> 00:20:17,700
he loved the redemption side of the story.
We wanted the world to know the story.

365
00:20:18,330 --> 00:20:21,570
So in the end, my family and I were very
pleased with the outcome of the film,

366
00:20:21,571 --> 00:20:25,170
but we thought in a couple of years I
would all be forgotten and move on with

367
00:20:25,171 --> 00:20:27,720
our life. I never dreamed
that. Catch me, if you can,

368
00:20:27,721 --> 00:20:31,740
we go on to earn more than a billion
dollars for dreamworks and be shown over

369
00:20:31,741 --> 00:20:36,741
and over literally every week on Hbo and
TV and then become a Broadway musical

370
00:20:37,711 --> 00:20:42,150
and a TV show. So consequently, every
Monday morning when I come to work,

371
00:20:42,151 --> 00:20:44,670
I have emails.
They come from all over the world.

372
00:20:45,270 --> 00:20:49,390
Someone who's seeing the movie for first
time watching the play at a community

373
00:20:49,391 --> 00:20:53,140
theater or a high school somewhere
and they feel compelled to write,

374
00:20:53,590 --> 00:20:57,040
and of course they come from people
literally as young as eight years old,

375
00:20:57,041 --> 00:21:01,750
sending those emails to people as old
as 80 most people assume I'll never read

376
00:21:01,751 --> 00:21:03,430
those emails or see those emails,

377
00:21:03,431 --> 00:21:07,330
but they feel compelled to write and
they want to make a statement. Some say,

378
00:21:07,331 --> 00:21:11,890
you know, you are brilliant.
You are an absolute genius.

379
00:21:12,130 --> 00:21:16,450
I was neither. I was just a
child, had been brilliant.

380
00:21:16,660 --> 00:21:17,650
Had it been a genius,

381
00:21:18,100 --> 00:21:21,460
I don't know that I would've found it
necessary to break the law in order to

382
00:21:21,461 --> 00:21:23,290
just simply survive.

383
00:21:24,010 --> 00:21:28,030
And while I know that people
are fascinated by what I
did some 50 years ago as a

384
00:21:28,031 --> 00:21:32,050
teenage boy, I've always looked upon
what I did is something that was immoral,

385
00:21:32,290 --> 00:21:33,730
illegal,
unethical,

386
00:21:33,910 --> 00:21:38,910
and a burden I live with literally every
single day of my life and will until my

387
00:21:39,461 --> 00:21:42,280
death. There are many who
write and say, well, you know,

388
00:21:42,281 --> 00:21:44,740
you were certainly gifted that it was.

389
00:21:45,280 --> 00:21:49,060
I was one of those few children and I
got to go up in the world with the Daddy.

390
00:21:50,410 --> 00:21:54,430
Now the world is,
the world is full of fathers,

391
00:21:55,720 --> 00:22:00,430
but there are very few men worthy of
being called daddy by their child.

392
00:22:01,090 --> 00:22:05,020
I had a daddy loved his children
more than you love life itself.

393
00:22:05,590 --> 00:22:09,610
Steven Spielberg, tow Barbara Walters
and mirror research frank shoes. Now,

394
00:22:09,611 --> 00:22:10,960
without having met frank,

395
00:22:11,470 --> 00:22:15,100
I couldn't help but put his father in
the film through the likes of Christopher

396
00:22:15,100 --> 00:22:18,940
Walken. My father was a man who had four
children, three boys and a daughter.

397
00:22:20,710 --> 00:22:23,290
Every night at bedtime,
he'd walk into your room.

398
00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:27,760
He was six three he would drop down
on one knee, kiss you on the cheek,

399
00:22:27,820 --> 00:22:28,631
pull the cover up,

400
00:22:28,631 --> 00:22:32,710
and he put his lip up on your ear lobe
and it whisper deep interior, I love you.

401
00:22:32,980 --> 00:22:37,600
I love you very much.
He never ever missed a night.

402
00:22:38,680 --> 00:22:41,830
As I grew older, I sometimes
fell asleep before he got home,

403
00:22:41,831 --> 00:22:45,430
but always woke up the next morning,
knew he had been back at my bedside.

404
00:22:46,030 --> 00:22:49,300
Years later, my older brother
joined me in my room temporarily.

405
00:22:49,301 --> 00:22:50,590
He was in the Marine Corps.

406
00:22:50,591 --> 00:22:53,890
He was six [inaudible] four he
played semipro football for Buffalo,

407
00:22:54,100 --> 00:22:57,670
but my father would walk around
to his bed, hug him, kiss him,

408
00:22:58,060 --> 00:23:02,800
whispering in his area. He
loved them. When I was 16
years old, I was just a child.

409
00:23:03,310 --> 00:23:06,550
All 16 year olds are just children,

410
00:23:07,570 --> 00:23:09,460
much as we'd like them to be adults,

411
00:23:10,210 --> 00:23:12,820
they're just children
and like all children,

412
00:23:13,240 --> 00:23:15,880
they need their mother and
they need their father.

413
00:23:16,510 --> 00:23:19,420
All children need their
mother and their father.

414
00:23:20,140 --> 00:23:25,140
All children are entitled to their mother
and their father and though it is not

415
00:23:25,721 --> 00:23:30,721
popular to say so divorce is a very
devastating thing for a child to deal with

416
00:23:31,540 --> 00:23:35,230
and then have to deal with the
rest of their natural life. For me,

417
00:23:35,231 --> 00:23:39,400
a complete stranger, a judge told me I
had to choose one parent over the other.

418
00:23:39,700 --> 00:23:43,660
That was a choice of 16 year old
boy could not make. So I rang.

419
00:23:44,320 --> 00:23:46,430
How could I tell you
my life was glamorous.

420
00:23:46,431 --> 00:23:50,930
I cried myself to sleep till I was
19 years old. I spent every birthday,

421
00:23:50,931 --> 00:23:52,160
Christmas,
mother's Day,

422
00:23:52,161 --> 00:23:56,210
Father's day in a hotel room somewhere
in the world where people didn't speak my

423
00:23:56,211 --> 00:23:57,044
language,

424
00:23:57,260 --> 00:24:00,530
the only people that associated with me
where people who believe me to be their

425
00:24:00,531 --> 00:24:03,650
peer 10 years older than I actually was.

426
00:24:04,190 --> 00:24:07,550
I never got to go to his senior prom,
high school football game.

427
00:24:07,551 --> 00:24:09,800
Share a relationship
with someone my own age.

428
00:24:10,310 --> 00:24:12,560
I always knew I'd get caught.

429
00:24:13,130 --> 00:24:15,770
Only a fool would think otherwise.

430
00:24:16,310 --> 00:24:19,970
The last sometimes sleeps with the law.
Never dies.

431
00:24:20,660 --> 00:24:23,600
I was caught.
I went to some very bad places.

432
00:24:24,050 --> 00:24:26,030
My boys have grown up asking their mother,

433
00:24:26,060 --> 00:24:29,300
why is it the dead gets up in the middle
of the night and goes down the TV room

434
00:24:29,301 --> 00:24:33,230
cause you know he didn't turn the TV on.
He just sits there all night as,

435
00:24:33,231 --> 00:24:37,550
because there are things you can forget
things you're not meant to forget what I

436
00:24:37,551 --> 00:24:39,650
was sitting in that pitch
black cell in France.

437
00:24:39,651 --> 00:24:43,580
My father 57 was climbing the subway
stairs in New York as he did every day.

438
00:24:43,581 --> 00:24:47,120
He was in great physical shape.
He just happened to trip.

439
00:24:47,810 --> 00:24:51,500
He reached his arm to break his fall.
He slipped, hit his head on a railing,

440
00:24:51,970 --> 00:24:55,760
laying it at the bottom of the step.
He was dead. I didn't know he was dead.

441
00:24:56,180 --> 00:24:59,300
I was thinking about them,
how much I couldn't wait to
see him, hold him, hug him,

442
00:24:59,301 --> 00:25:03,800
kiss him, tell him how sorry I was, but
I never got the opportunity to do that.

443
00:25:04,460 --> 00:25:09,080
I was very fortunate because I was raised
in a great country where everyone gets

444
00:25:09,081 --> 00:25:10,070
a second chance.

445
00:25:10,490 --> 00:25:15,490
I owe my country 800 times more than I
can ever repay it over these past four

446
00:25:15,741 --> 00:25:19,100
decades.
That is why I'm at the FBI today.

447
00:25:19,280 --> 00:25:24,280
32 years after the federal court
order expired requiring me to do so.

448
00:25:26,390 --> 00:25:30,770
I have turned down three pardons from
three sitting presidents of the United

449
00:25:30,770 --> 00:25:35,630
States because I do not believe no will
I ever believe that a piece of paper,

450
00:25:36,050 --> 00:25:41,000
we'll excuse my actions. That
only in the end my actions. Well,

451
00:25:42,050 --> 00:25:45,740
40 plus years ago on an undercover
assignment in Houston, Texas,

452
00:25:45,741 --> 00:25:48,800
I met my wife when the
assignment was over.

453
00:25:48,860 --> 00:25:51,770
I broke protocol to tell
her who I really was.

454
00:25:52,250 --> 00:25:53,870
I didn't have a dime to my name,

455
00:25:54,440 --> 00:25:58,250
but I eventually asked her to marry
me against the wishes of her parents.

456
00:25:58,610 --> 00:26:03,380
She did, and I could sit up here
and tell you that I was born again.

457
00:26:03,410 --> 00:26:06,800
I saw the light prison rehabilitated me,

458
00:26:07,130 --> 00:26:09,800
but the truth is God gave me a wife.

459
00:26:10,460 --> 00:26:12,200
She gave me three beautiful children.

460
00:26:12,590 --> 00:26:15,260
She gave me a family
and she changed my life.

461
00:26:15,860 --> 00:26:19,730
She and she alone.
Everything I have,

462
00:26:19,970 --> 00:26:22,360
everything I've achieved,
who I am today.

463
00:26:22,370 --> 00:26:25,940
It's because of the love of a woman and
the respect three boys have for their

464
00:26:25,941 --> 00:26:29,180
father.
Something I would never ever jeopardize.

465
00:26:29,840 --> 00:26:31,670
There comes a time in all of our lifetime,

466
00:26:31,671 --> 00:26:34,310
we grow older and eventually
if we're fortunate enough,

467
00:26:34,340 --> 00:26:37,100
we have children and
as every parent knows,

468
00:26:37,101 --> 00:26:40,700
whether your child is three
months old or 38 years old,

469
00:26:41,150 --> 00:26:42,920
when you lay your head
on a pillow at night,

470
00:26:42,990 --> 00:26:46,230
you're just about to close your eyes.
The last thing you think about,

471
00:26:46,680 --> 00:26:51,180
last thing you worry about
are your children. So if
you still have your mother,

472
00:26:52,080 --> 00:26:56,250
you still have your father, you
give him a hug, you give him a kiss,

473
00:26:56,610 --> 00:27:00,750
you're telling me you love them while you
can. And to those men in the audience,

474
00:27:00,751 --> 00:27:01,650
both young and old,

475
00:27:01,651 --> 00:27:06,651
I would remind you what it truly is to
actually be a man has absolutely nothing

476
00:27:07,921 --> 00:27:11,250
to do with money, achievements, skills,

477
00:27:11,580 --> 00:27:15,540
complements degrees,
professions, physicians,

478
00:27:16,350 --> 00:27:19,050
a real man loves his wife.

479
00:27:19,860 --> 00:27:24,860
A real man is faithful to his wife and
real mat next to God and his country.

480
00:27:26,310 --> 00:27:30,420
Put his wife and his children as the
most important thing in his life.

481
00:27:31,050 --> 00:27:34,410
Steven Spielberg made a wonderful film,
but I've done nothing greater,

482
00:27:34,530 --> 00:27:37,080
nothing more rewarding,
nothing more worthwhile,

483
00:27:37,110 --> 00:27:40,440
nothing makes actually brought me
more peace, more joy, more happiness,

484
00:27:40,441 --> 00:27:45,390
more content in my life than simply
being a good husband, a good father,

485
00:27:45,870 --> 00:27:48,540
and what I strive to be every
day of my life. A Great Daddy.

486
00:27:48,810 --> 00:27:50,490
God bless you and thanks
for coming this morning.

487
00:27:51,370 --> 00:27:56,370
[inaudible] we have

488
00:28:00,350 --> 00:28:04,760
bunch of questions, both a
from the audience as well
as some people have sent in.

489
00:28:04,761 --> 00:28:07,130
So we'll take some questions.
I'll be happy. Good answer.

490
00:28:08,500 --> 00:28:12,610
Do you have any advice for Googlers
who are feeling imposter syndrome,

491
00:28:13,030 --> 00:28:17,890
the insecure feeling that they're
not nearly as good at their jobs,

492
00:28:18,370 --> 00:28:20,350
at their job is their
colleagues believe they are?

493
00:28:20,860 --> 00:28:25,060
And how did you stay confident or did you,
when you knew you were,

494
00:28:25,120 --> 00:28:26,350
you were in an imposter?

495
00:28:27,370 --> 00:28:31,160
You know, people always say
to me, you know, you are
brilliant. You are a genius. No,

496
00:28:31,161 --> 00:28:34,790
I was an adolescent and that
was why I was successful.

497
00:28:34,910 --> 00:28:39,320
I was so young that I had no fear of
being caught. I was so young then.

498
00:28:39,321 --> 00:28:41,270
I didn't think about consequences.

499
00:28:41,810 --> 00:28:44,770
Everything I did was not premeditated.

500
00:28:44,840 --> 00:28:48,860
Everything was done by
opportunity or by chance. So if,

501
00:28:48,861 --> 00:28:52,910
in fact I was standing out in front of
a bank in Manhattan with a $500 check,

502
00:28:52,911 --> 00:28:55,580
there was never a plan.
I didn't say to myself,

503
00:28:55,610 --> 00:29:00,050
I'm going in cash check. If
they say this, I'll do this.

504
00:29:00,051 --> 00:29:01,670
If they do this,
I'll do that.

505
00:29:01,700 --> 00:29:06,020
I just went in and did it and I felt
that there was nothing I couldn't do.

506
00:29:06,110 --> 00:29:10,760
I had tremendous confidence in myself,
but everything was for a reason.

507
00:29:10,761 --> 00:29:12,530
So I saw that airline crew,

508
00:29:12,531 --> 00:29:16,190
I never dreamed about getting on planes
or staying in hotels around the world

509
00:29:16,191 --> 00:29:19,280
for free. All I saw was a
uniform and said to myself,

510
00:29:19,520 --> 00:29:21,980
if it had that uniform on
and I walked in a bank,

511
00:29:22,220 --> 00:29:24,140
it would be a lot easier to cash a check.

512
00:29:24,380 --> 00:29:26,660
Then me walking in is just some young kid.

513
00:29:26,690 --> 00:29:29,630
So the whole thing was to
get a uniform and do that.

514
00:29:29,810 --> 00:29:32,510
But then I quickly realized
the power of that uniform,

515
00:29:32,540 --> 00:29:35,270
how it turned from night today.
No one ever said no.

516
00:29:35,271 --> 00:29:36,770
When I walked in to cash a check,

517
00:29:36,771 --> 00:29:39,560
even though there was no bank
account there or anything else,

518
00:29:39,561 --> 00:29:44,260
all they saw was the uniform didn't
see me and I realized very early on the

519
00:29:44,261 --> 00:29:49,261
power of that uniform and then I realized
I had gone to the TWA ticket counter

520
00:29:49,391 --> 00:29:50,830
just like he showed in the movie.

521
00:29:51,160 --> 00:29:54,940
I was going to purchase an airline
ticket and the ticket agents said to me,

522
00:29:54,970 --> 00:29:59,110
are you writing for free? Are you buying
the ticket? And I said, riding for free.

523
00:29:59,200 --> 00:30:02,550
Yeah, you are on the jumpseat.
And I learned about the jump seat.

524
00:30:02,560 --> 00:30:06,760
So then I flew around the world for
free. Everything I did, I did. By chance,

525
00:30:07,120 --> 00:30:09,520
I moved into an apartment
complex in Atlanta.

526
00:30:09,521 --> 00:30:12,820
I said I was a doctor because I didn't
want to write down airline pilot.

527
00:30:12,821 --> 00:30:16,810
They were looking for me with that
airline pilot. So I said it was a doctor.

528
00:30:17,280 --> 00:30:18,670
I said pediatrician,

529
00:30:18,671 --> 00:30:22,240
because it was a singles complex and there
were only single people living there.

530
00:30:22,570 --> 00:30:25,930
And then I met a doctor who lived there
and then he took me up to the hospital

531
00:30:25,931 --> 00:30:28,180
and I met people.
So I ended up at the hospital.

532
00:30:28,570 --> 00:30:32,290
I dated a flight attendant who's father
was the attorney general in Louisiana.

533
00:30:32,590 --> 00:30:35,980
I had told her that I had
gone to law school, but I
never practiced law. Instead,

534
00:30:35,981 --> 00:30:39,130
I wanted it to be a pilot and
got furloughed from the airline.

535
00:30:39,131 --> 00:30:42,100
So she introduced me to
her dad and I went to work.

536
00:30:42,130 --> 00:30:44,140
Everything was all these opportunities,

537
00:30:44,141 --> 00:30:48,650
but always a confidence that I could
pull it off in that that became, uh,

538
00:30:48,700 --> 00:30:49,600
just from age.

539
00:30:49,840 --> 00:30:53,530
But if you believe that you're good at
what you do and you strive to be good at

540
00:30:53,740 --> 00:30:56,530
what you do, you don't need to
worry about what other people think.

541
00:30:56,560 --> 00:31:00,160
You need to be able to understand that
you have your own confidence that you can

542
00:31:00,161 --> 00:31:04,210
do whatever it is you're required
to do and other people will see that

543
00:31:04,211 --> 00:31:07,750
confidence in you.
The minute you start doubting yourself,

544
00:31:07,780 --> 00:31:08,980
other people will see that,

545
00:31:09,140 --> 00:31:13,510
that you're doubting yourself and that
becomes a weakness in your personality.

546
00:31:13,610 --> 00:31:16,660
So you always want to be confident in
everything you do that you can do it,

547
00:31:16,661 --> 00:31:19,540
you can get it done, you'll find
a way to get it. I get it done.

548
00:31:20,630 --> 00:31:24,560
Obviously technology has evolved quite
a bit since you were going around and

549
00:31:24,561 --> 00:31:25,251
things like that.

550
00:31:25,251 --> 00:31:29,420
Would somebody be able to accomplish
something similar today even with all of

551
00:31:29,421 --> 00:31:30,930
the technical advancements?

552
00:31:31,370 --> 00:31:34,550
Yeah. You know, I get asked that a
lot, actually. It's sorry to say,

553
00:31:34,551 --> 00:31:38,330
but 4,000 times easier
today than when I did it.

554
00:31:38,720 --> 00:31:40,460
A technology breach crime,

555
00:31:40,630 --> 00:31:44,720
and it always has and it always will and
there will always be people willing to

556
00:31:44,721 --> 00:31:49,370
use technology. In a self
serving a way. So you know,

557
00:31:49,371 --> 00:31:52,550
I always use the example that
when I used to forge checks,

558
00:31:52,610 --> 00:31:54,440
I needed a Heidelberg printing press.

559
00:31:54,441 --> 00:31:56,990
It took me about 12 months
to learn that press.

560
00:31:57,290 --> 00:32:01,430
That was a million dollar printing
press who is 90 feet long, 18 feet high.

561
00:32:01,760 --> 00:32:04,460
It required three journeymen
operators to operate it.

562
00:32:04,461 --> 00:32:08,450
So I bill scaffoldings on either sides
of the press so I could eliminate the

563
00:32:08,451 --> 00:32:10,730
other two positions.
And because I was a teenager,

564
00:32:11,030 --> 00:32:15,020
I was able to run the length of that
press. But there were color separations,

565
00:32:15,050 --> 00:32:17,570
there were negatives,
there were chemicals you had to work with,

566
00:32:17,571 --> 00:32:22,010
there were plates you had to make.
There was typesetting involved. I today,

567
00:32:22,100 --> 00:32:26,810
one just opens a laptop and decides
to forge counterfeited check.

568
00:32:26,811 --> 00:32:30,980
They first bring up a diagram of a chick
with a little security background in it

569
00:32:31,580 --> 00:32:34,320
and then they go and look on
who's checked in and afford.

570
00:32:34,340 --> 00:32:36,830
So if I'm going to forge for example,
into its check,

571
00:32:37,100 --> 00:32:39,200
I go to the company's website,

572
00:32:39,230 --> 00:32:42,500
capture their logo and put it up on the
corner of the left part of the top of

573
00:32:42,501 --> 00:32:44,780
the check.
I put it in their corporate address,

574
00:32:45,080 --> 00:32:48,500
I might put some stuff in the background
and step and repeat patterns or

575
00:32:48,501 --> 00:32:49,730
whatever it is I'm designing.

576
00:32:50,060 --> 00:32:53,570
And in 15 minutes I have a
four color beautiful check,

577
00:32:53,571 --> 00:32:57,470
prettier than the real check
they use up on my website. Now,

578
00:32:57,471 --> 00:33:00,420
in the old days you to would
have said to me, you know, um,

579
00:33:00,470 --> 00:33:04,220
this check you're printing from Pan
Am I have to admit. Pretty awesome.

580
00:33:04,490 --> 00:33:09,470
It's amazing for color. It's looks
terrific. But uh, let me ask you this.

581
00:33:09,500 --> 00:33:12,380
How do you know where pan and banks,
I have no idea whether it bank,

582
00:33:12,560 --> 00:33:15,530
so I'm just making up a bank's name,
a chase Manhattan Bank,

583
00:33:15,650 --> 00:33:18,980
one Chase Plaza in New York. Yeah. How
do you know what the account number is?

584
00:33:19,200 --> 00:33:22,100
I have no ideas.
I'm just making up a bunch of numbers.

585
00:33:22,580 --> 00:33:26,390
How do you know who the authorized signer
is? I Dunno, I'm just signing somebody,

586
00:33:26,570 --> 00:33:28,520
Joe Black,
whatever name on that check.

587
00:33:28,940 --> 00:33:32,810
But we live in a way too much information
world today. So one side forge,

588
00:33:32,811 --> 00:33:37,811
Intuit's check every forger calls their
victim twice because every four Joe will

589
00:33:39,111 --> 00:33:42,980
tell you a victim will tell me everything
I need to know. So when he calls,

590
00:33:42,981 --> 00:33:46,340
he would have simply said like, just
speak to someone in accounts receivables.

591
00:33:46,400 --> 00:33:49,310
Sure. One moment counts
receivables can help you. Yeah,

592
00:33:49,380 --> 00:33:52,460
I was getting ready to pay an invoice
you sent us, but we prefer to wire you.

593
00:33:52,461 --> 00:33:56,660
The funds just needed wiring instructions.
Yes. So we banked with Bank of America.

594
00:33:56,690 --> 00:34:00,530
Account number is one seven six eight
five three they tell you right on the

595
00:34:00,531 --> 00:34:03,830
phone you can call any company and just
tell him you're going to wire the money.

596
00:34:03,831 --> 00:34:06,350
They're going to tell you where they
bank on one street, their account number.

597
00:34:06,680 --> 00:34:09,140
But you need on the check.
So I captured the bank's logo.

598
00:34:09,141 --> 00:34:12,740
I put it on the checkup at the mic or
line down on the bottom and I hang up and

599
00:34:12,741 --> 00:34:15,260
call back into a corporation
going help you. Yeah,

600
00:34:15,261 --> 00:34:19,160
I like to speak to someone in your
corporate communications shareware moment.

601
00:34:19,580 --> 00:34:21,570
Corporate communications can help you.
Yeah.

602
00:34:21,571 --> 00:34:25,310
I wonder if you'd be so kind of some mail
me a copy of your annual report. Sure.

603
00:34:25,311 --> 00:34:28,670
I'll send you one out today on page three
is a signature of the chairman of the

604
00:34:28,671 --> 00:34:32,240
board, the CEO, the CFO, and the
treasurer, white glossy paper,

605
00:34:32,241 --> 00:34:36,110
black ink camera ready arts scan it,
digitize it, put it on the check.

606
00:34:36,450 --> 00:34:40,350
The technology has made it much,
much easier when we talk about ids.

607
00:34:40,670 --> 00:34:44,390
Making an airline id today would be
very simple with the technology that's

608
00:34:44,391 --> 00:34:48,800
available today.
So all of those things are a lot easier.

609
00:34:49,130 --> 00:34:52,370
And so I used to say that we'd be a
little more difficult for me to get on an

610
00:34:52,371 --> 00:34:54,560
aircraft today posing as a pilot.

611
00:34:54,860 --> 00:34:57,800
But if you ever go to the airport and
watched the crews go through the airport,

612
00:34:57,801 --> 00:35:01,760
they just simply hold up a card and
they go through the airport that anyone

613
00:35:01,761 --> 00:35:05,870
could make that card with today's software
and technology that's available to

614
00:35:05,871 --> 00:35:10,190
anybody. So, uh, technology has
certainly made it a lot easier.

615
00:35:10,191 --> 00:35:14,210
So that's why we're constantly making
technology to counter the use of

616
00:35:14,211 --> 00:35:18,020
technology by criminals and to make it
more difficult for them to convert that

617
00:35:18,021 --> 00:35:20,450
technology into a negative, uh, idea.

618
00:35:20,840 --> 00:35:22,190
And your candid opinion,

619
00:35:22,191 --> 00:35:26,900
did Leonardo Dicaprio and Tom
Hanks do justice t e two urine?

620
00:35:26,990 --> 00:35:30,140
Joseph,
she's respective roles in the movie.

621
00:35:30,660 --> 00:35:33,730
Yeah. You know, I'm, I'm not a
big movie person, so I don't, I,

622
00:35:33,731 --> 00:35:36,840
I've watch very little television.
This is most of my life, not just,

623
00:35:37,170 --> 00:35:39,900
I took up even as a kid,
I didn't watch a lot of television.

624
00:35:39,901 --> 00:35:43,410
I don't watch a lot of television now.
And I certainly very rarely go to movies.

625
00:35:43,411 --> 00:35:47,460
And, uh, so when it was
announced that Leo had,

626
00:35:47,520 --> 00:35:50,770
was the person picked to play the part,
I really knew nothing about them.

627
00:35:51,320 --> 00:35:54,870
My sons weren't too happy that
it was Leo. But, uh, I didn't,

628
00:35:54,900 --> 00:35:56,000
I didn't know anything about them.

629
00:35:56,001 --> 00:36:00,870
So I went to the movies and saw street
gangs of New York and I said to myself,

630
00:36:00,871 --> 00:36:05,160
sitting there, how would this person
portray a person? 16 years old.

631
00:36:05,430 --> 00:36:09,150
He had a beard. He was at the time
he filmed that movie was about 27,

632
00:36:09,151 --> 00:36:13,680
28 years old. Uh, I thought no
one's going to believe this guy 16,

633
00:36:13,681 --> 00:36:15,390
but because I'd never saw the script,

634
00:36:15,391 --> 00:36:18,900
I didn't know if maybe Spielberg was
making the character a lot older and not a

635
00:36:18,901 --> 00:36:21,180
teenager.
Now when the movie came out,

636
00:36:21,210 --> 00:36:25,470
it was quite amazing that Leo starts out
in the film at 14 and he's 16 and he's

637
00:36:25,471 --> 00:36:27,390
18 and he's 21.
Uh,

638
00:36:27,600 --> 00:36:32,130
he is an amazing character actor and he
took the role and he did an amazing job

639
00:36:32,131 --> 00:36:36,750
of playing the role. Tom Hanks, his
character was actually named Joe Shay, s,

640
00:36:36,751 --> 00:36:39,120
h e a who was an Irishman from Boston.

641
00:36:39,420 --> 00:36:42,780
Joe Shay was my supervisor at the
FBI after I came out of prison.

642
00:36:42,781 --> 00:36:47,160
I answered directly to him and I were
friends for 30 years until his death.

643
00:36:47,580 --> 00:36:51,270
I've written five books on crime.
The last book I wrote stealing your life.

644
00:36:51,271 --> 00:36:54,600
I dedicated that book to him
and our 30 year relationship.

645
00:36:55,050 --> 00:36:57,660
But he was an Irishman from
Boston in which Tom Hanks,

646
00:36:57,661 --> 00:36:59,580
he didn't want his real name.
You.

647
00:36:59,581 --> 00:37:04,440
So Tom Hanks used the name of an old
football player and took that name call

648
00:37:04,441 --> 00:37:08,970
hand Randy. But if you are watching the
screen for me it was like watching him.

649
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:12,870
He looked like him. He sounded
like him. He had his mannerisms.

650
00:37:13,250 --> 00:37:14,770
I did an amazing job.
Uh,

651
00:37:14,850 --> 00:37:19,500
both of them and portraying the pots are
real people that were still living at

652
00:37:19,501 --> 00:37:20,334
that time.

653
00:37:21,890 --> 00:37:26,010
So first of all, as a father, your
statement was just starting to tiering,

654
00:37:27,860 --> 00:37:31,610
totally practical with the Equifax hacks
and yet them hacks that every one in

655
00:37:31,611 --> 00:37:34,310
this room has been probably
affected by one of the other.

656
00:37:34,940 --> 00:37:39,940
Is there anything we can do as citizens
to protect ourselves or is it a lost

657
00:37:39,951 --> 00:37:40,590
cause?

658
00:37:40,590 --> 00:37:43,920
No, I'll tell you what to do. But let
me explain this to you. That is where I,

659
00:37:43,950 --> 00:37:46,200
when I went to the FBI 41 years ago,

660
00:37:46,201 --> 00:37:48,990
I worked undercover for
a long period of time.

661
00:37:49,020 --> 00:37:52,230
Then I went into the field and dealt
with counterfeits and forgeries

662
00:37:52,231 --> 00:37:55,410
embezzlement at financial crimes.
In the last 20 years,

663
00:37:55,411 --> 00:37:58,290
I've dealt with only cyber related crimes.

664
00:37:58,650 --> 00:38:00,840
So I spend most of my time with breaches.

665
00:38:00,841 --> 00:38:05,220
I have worked every breach
back to Tj Maxx 15 years ago,

666
00:38:05,610 --> 00:38:09,840
and this is what I've learned.
First of all, every single breach,

667
00:38:10,230 --> 00:38:15,230
every breach occurs because somebody in
that company did something they weren't

668
00:38:15,271 --> 00:38:16,170
supposed to do,

669
00:38:17,040 --> 00:38:21,750
or somebody in that company failed to
do something they were supposed to do.

670
00:38:21,990 --> 00:38:26,070
Hackers do not cause breaches.
People do.

671
00:38:27,210 --> 00:38:30,750
And every bridge comes down to that.
So in the case of Equifax,

672
00:38:30,751 --> 00:38:32,610
they didn't update their infrastructure.

673
00:38:32,610 --> 00:38:34,950
They didn't fix the patches
it should have put in place.

674
00:38:35,290 --> 00:38:37,780
They were very negligent
and what they were doing.

675
00:38:37,990 --> 00:38:41,770
So the hacker waited for the door to open.
So when you interview a hacker,

676
00:38:41,771 --> 00:38:44,530
the hacker will say to you, look,
I can't get into chase bank.

677
00:38:44,590 --> 00:38:48,010
The truth is they spend about a half a
billion dollars a year on technology.

678
00:38:48,070 --> 00:38:52,750
Every 12 months they spend a half a
billion dollars of their profit on putting

679
00:38:52,751 --> 00:38:56,860
technology in software in their
bank to keep me out. However,

680
00:38:57,220 --> 00:39:00,130
they employ 200,000 people worldwide.

681
00:39:00,820 --> 00:39:05,260
All I have to do is wait for one of
those people to do something they weren't

682
00:39:05,261 --> 00:39:08,530
supposed to do or fail to do
what they were supposed to do,

683
00:39:08,770 --> 00:39:12,750
and that'll open the
door for me to get in a,

684
00:39:12,940 --> 00:39:17,290
when you steal credit card numbers,
like home depot, target Tj Maxx,

685
00:39:17,320 --> 00:39:21,430
that's stealing credit cards and debit
card information that has a very short,

686
00:39:21,431 --> 00:39:24,580
short shelf life, so you have to
get rid of it very, very quickly.

687
00:39:25,030 --> 00:39:29,200
But if I steal your name, your social
security number and your date of birth,

688
00:39:29,380 --> 00:39:32,710
you can't change your name. You can
change your social security number.

689
00:39:33,310 --> 00:39:34,660
You can't change your date of birth.

690
00:39:35,500 --> 00:39:39,880
So those people warehouse that
data for two to three years.

691
00:39:40,300 --> 00:39:44,560
So we won't even see that surface for
at least a couple of years before.

692
00:39:44,561 --> 00:39:47,500
Some of that will start to surface.
The data that was stolen,

693
00:39:48,040 --> 00:39:51,310
whatever number they start with,
I think was 143 million.

694
00:39:51,311 --> 00:39:55,300
Then it became 146 million.
It was a million drivers licenses.

695
00:39:55,301 --> 00:39:57,790
Now it's 10.6 million drivers licenses.

696
00:39:58,310 --> 00:40:02,050
All breaches start with very low numbers
before they let you know the actual

697
00:40:02,051 --> 00:40:02,741
true numbers.

698
00:40:02,741 --> 00:40:07,360
So it's probably about 240 million
pieces of information that was stolen.

699
00:40:08,080 --> 00:40:12,220
But I remind people all the time that
they're going to warehouse that data.

700
00:40:12,340 --> 00:40:16,480
So buying one year credit monitoring
services absolutely worthless because

701
00:40:16,481 --> 00:40:21,310
nothing's going to happen in a year.
And if you really analyze, uh, Equifax,

702
00:40:21,340 --> 00:40:25,450
they were very unethical in what they did.
They thought to themselves,

703
00:40:25,451 --> 00:40:28,720
first of all, they sold a bunch of stock
knowing that it was going to come out.

704
00:40:28,750 --> 00:40:32,440
That was worse. But then they stat there
and said, how do we make a profit from,

705
00:40:32,441 --> 00:40:36,070
this was our mistake,
but how we turn this around into a profit.

706
00:40:36,340 --> 00:40:37,690
So they sat there and said,

707
00:40:37,691 --> 00:40:41,680
what we'll do is we'll offer millions
of millions of people one year of credit

708
00:40:41,681 --> 00:40:46,150
monitoring service for free.
They'll sign up and in a year from now,

709
00:40:46,151 --> 00:40:49,030
we'll simply say,
that data hasn't really surfaced yet.

710
00:40:49,270 --> 00:40:53,170
You need to be enrolled automatically
into our program, which is $20 a month.

711
00:40:53,171 --> 00:40:55,840
So they're going to make millions and
millions of dollars would automatic

712
00:40:56,320 --> 00:41:00,970
enrollment into their, their
program. Um, if you've been a breach,

713
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:03,520
if you've been a subject of that breach,

714
00:41:03,521 --> 00:41:07,090
there's only two things you can
do and two things. Only one,

715
00:41:07,120 --> 00:41:10,870
you can freeze your credit. Uh,
each state varies about that.

716
00:41:10,871 --> 00:41:14,110
So some states freezing your
credit is free. Other states,

717
00:41:14,111 --> 00:41:18,130
there is a fee associated with it.
Typically $10 to freeze it,

718
00:41:18,310 --> 00:41:22,570
$18 to unfreeze it, $10 to
freeze it. Uh, again, uh,

719
00:41:22,610 --> 00:41:26,350
so for the last two years I've testified
before Congress and you go to my

720
00:41:26,351 --> 00:41:30,100
website at [inaudible] dot com you'll
see me testifying before Congress telling

721
00:41:30,101 --> 00:41:34,970
them that they need to pet a federal law
across 50 states that allow anyone to

722
00:41:34,971 --> 00:41:37,880
freeze their credit at
anytime and unfreeze it.

723
00:41:38,090 --> 00:41:41,660
And any time there should be no reason
that there should be a fee associated

724
00:41:41,661 --> 00:41:45,830
with it because then that becomes a
deterrent to people, uh, actually, uh,

725
00:41:45,831 --> 00:41:49,550
freezing their credit so
you can freeze your credit.

726
00:41:49,551 --> 00:41:53,300
That's one thing you can do and then
you unfreeze it if you need it. Um, if,

727
00:41:53,330 --> 00:41:54,950
if there's not too much of a hassle.

728
00:41:55,160 --> 00:41:57,500
And then the only other thing
is to monitor your credit.

729
00:41:57,501 --> 00:42:02,501
So I've used a credit monitoring service
since 1992 so for about 25 years I've

730
00:42:02,571 --> 00:42:06,860
been using a service,
I think they charged me like $12 a month.

731
00:42:07,370 --> 00:42:10,760
The reason I like it,
I can monitor my own credit.

732
00:42:10,820 --> 00:42:14,990
I don't need them all they've given me
for that $12 is the ability to go on my

733
00:42:14,991 --> 00:42:19,730
keyboard and a few strokes and bring up
my credit reports instantly on my screen

734
00:42:20,030 --> 00:42:24,350
and up on my screen comes all
three reports, Equifax, Experian,

735
00:42:24,351 --> 00:42:28,280
transunion. At the top is my
score for the moment of that day,

736
00:42:28,281 --> 00:42:30,740
what my credit score is
that those three agencies.

737
00:42:31,130 --> 00:42:35,120
Then I can scroll down and look at my
credit and I can say to myself, you know,

738
00:42:35,121 --> 00:42:37,040
I paid this car off like four months ago.

739
00:42:37,041 --> 00:42:39,050
They still show that I
owe money to this bank.

740
00:42:39,380 --> 00:42:44,180
I have correct that and I can go all the
way down and see every inquiry made on

741
00:42:44,181 --> 00:42:47,240
my credit. That's what we
call hard and soft inquires.

742
00:42:47,650 --> 00:42:51,470
And that's your employer checking your
credit, the IRS checking your credit,

743
00:42:51,471 --> 00:42:52,430
your insurance company,

744
00:42:52,431 --> 00:42:56,330
checking your credit or a credit card
you applied for and they're checking your

745
00:42:56,331 --> 00:43:00,370
credit. So I really don't
need them, but for fee, uh,

746
00:43:00,430 --> 00:43:02,990
they're also monitoring my credit as well.

747
00:43:03,020 --> 00:43:06,410
So they're checking my credit and they
letting me know in real time if someone

748
00:43:06,411 --> 00:43:09,620
attempts to use my social security
number to get a job opened,

749
00:43:09,621 --> 00:43:14,540
a bank account or whatever the case
may be. So to me it's worth using that.

750
00:43:15,350 --> 00:43:19,010
Now one other tip I'll give you
is I don't own a debit card.

751
00:43:19,310 --> 00:43:23,480
I've never owned one. I've never
allowed my three sons to possess one,

752
00:43:24,080 --> 00:43:29,080
certainly in truly the worst financial
tool ever given to the American consumer.

753
00:43:30,020 --> 00:43:32,930
So a long time ago I asked
myself a simple question,

754
00:43:32,960 --> 00:43:37,960
how would I remove 99.9% of my
personal liability like that,

755
00:43:39,050 --> 00:43:41,120
where they really don't want to
worry about all these things?

756
00:43:41,900 --> 00:43:45,890
So I use the safest form of payment
that exists on the face of the earth and

757
00:43:45,891 --> 00:43:50,270
that is a credit card, credit card, visa,

758
00:43:50,271 --> 00:43:54,500
mastercard, American Express,
discover card. Not Debit credit,

759
00:43:55,040 --> 00:43:59,690
but credit card.
Every day of my life I spend their money.

760
00:44:00,050 --> 00:44:02,810
I don't spend my money.
My money sits in a money market account.

761
00:44:02,811 --> 00:44:03,501
It earns interest.

762
00:44:03,501 --> 00:44:07,010
Actually nobody knows where it is because
not exposed to anybody to find it.

763
00:44:07,190 --> 00:44:10,370
It's just sitting there. I go to
the dry cleaner, I give him my card,

764
00:44:10,520 --> 00:44:14,270
I pick up the groceries, I
give him my card, I put fuel
in my boat on the weekend.

765
00:44:14,271 --> 00:44:17,090
I use my card. I paid the marina
to keep my boat in the water.

766
00:44:17,090 --> 00:44:21,740
All year long they put the rent on my
credit card. I travel all over the world.

767
00:44:22,100 --> 00:44:25,760
Why wait to get reimbursed?
I use my credit card if I need euro's,

768
00:44:25,850 --> 00:44:28,190
I go to the ATM machine.
I used my credit card.

769
00:44:28,430 --> 00:44:33,300
I'm not gonna use my debit card to get
euros or a pounds and Great Britain.

770
00:44:34,110 --> 00:44:38,490
And every day I use my card and then if
I pay the bill in full or part of the

771
00:44:38,491 --> 00:44:40,140
bill,
my credit score goes up.

772
00:44:40,230 --> 00:44:44,730
So I'm building credit while I'm
using net credit card and if tomorrow,

773
00:44:44,731 --> 00:44:47,190
and I'll do everything to
protect my information,

774
00:44:47,220 --> 00:44:52,220
but if tomorrow someone gets my card
number and charges $1 million on my credit

775
00:44:54,691 --> 00:44:59,520
card by federal law, my liability
is zero. I have no liability.

776
00:44:59,970 --> 00:45:03,540
So yes, I love to shop online.
I don't use a special card,

777
00:45:03,541 --> 00:45:06,780
I just use my credit card if they
don't deliver the merchandise,

778
00:45:07,020 --> 00:45:08,520
if they deliver it and it's broken.

779
00:45:09,030 --> 00:45:11,850
If the host side I went to
is fictitious to begin with,

780
00:45:12,030 --> 00:45:16,200
I have no zero lead zero liability.
When you use your debit card,

781
00:45:16,201 --> 00:45:19,050
every time you reach for your
exposing the money in your account,

782
00:45:19,110 --> 00:45:22,920
the only person's going to get robbed
as you, when you use your debit card,

783
00:45:22,921 --> 00:45:25,650
you could use it for the next 50 years,
20 times a day.

784
00:45:25,651 --> 00:45:28,710
You will not raise your
credit score by that much.

785
00:45:29,340 --> 00:45:34,340
And of course when you use your debit
card you are liable up to a certain amount

786
00:45:34,441 --> 00:45:37,650
and it takes a while in order
to get that debit card fixed.

787
00:45:37,651 --> 00:45:42,240
So when we do post investigations that
breaches and we say to someone on your

788
00:45:42,241 --> 00:45:44,160
incident, what happened?
While I was in target,

789
00:45:44,161 --> 00:45:47,070
but I used a visa card
so I don't know nothing.

790
00:45:47,071 --> 00:45:49,530
I got to cancel my card the next day,

791
00:45:49,770 --> 00:45:53,700
two days later Fedex sent me a new card
and that was the last I heard about it.

792
00:45:53,760 --> 00:45:54,593
What about you?

793
00:45:54,890 --> 00:45:58,890
And I use the debit card there that
took $3,000 out of my checking account.

794
00:45:59,010 --> 00:46:01,230
It took me two months to
get my money back. Why?

795
00:46:01,231 --> 00:46:05,010
They said they were investigating. I
had to pay my rent, had kids' tuition,

796
00:46:05,310 --> 00:46:09,150
everything. I couldn't pay it because
they had my money. So I do it for that.

797
00:46:09,151 --> 00:46:11,730
So I had three sons that went off
to college and I've said to them,

798
00:46:11,790 --> 00:46:13,140
I'm not giving you a debit card.

799
00:46:13,680 --> 00:46:17,100
I've actually applied for a credit
card in your name. So chill card.

800
00:46:17,310 --> 00:46:20,400
Of course you're 18 you have no credit.
So I guarantee the card.

801
00:46:20,940 --> 00:46:24,570
So as a guarantee or of the card,
three things take place. One,

802
00:46:24,840 --> 00:46:27,390
the bill comes to me and I'm
responsible for the bill.

803
00:46:27,420 --> 00:46:30,840
So if you spend a lot of time in the bar,
I'm going to know that too.

804
00:46:31,070 --> 00:46:32,910
And I set the limit on the card.

805
00:46:32,910 --> 00:46:35,910
So whatever I want you to spend each
month is while you're at school,

806
00:46:35,970 --> 00:46:40,260
I'll set that limit. Third, every month
that I pay, the bill goes on your credit.

807
00:46:40,890 --> 00:46:42,630
So by the time you get out of college,

808
00:46:42,660 --> 00:46:46,200
you should be looking at a credit score
of about 800 you want to buy a car,

809
00:46:46,201 --> 00:46:49,410
buy a house, buy a condo. You're
not going to need me to do that.

810
00:46:49,440 --> 00:46:54,440
All three of my sons came out of college
with grades us scores of the round 801

811
00:46:54,601 --> 00:46:58,770
of the best things you can do for your
kids is to teach them to learn to use

812
00:46:58,771 --> 00:47:03,720
credit early on and build credit in their
name. Credit is a very important thing.

813
00:47:03,750 --> 00:47:06,750
30 years ago, it only meant when he
got the car, he got the house. Today,

814
00:47:06,751 --> 00:47:09,150
everything is based on your credit.
The company hires you,

815
00:47:09,151 --> 00:47:10,260
they're going to check your credit.

816
00:47:10,740 --> 00:47:13,980
If your buy auto insurance is going to
check your credit, you buy life insurance,

817
00:47:13,981 --> 00:47:17,070
I'm going to check your credit.
Everything is based on your credit.

818
00:47:17,071 --> 00:47:20,580
So you want to make sure that you
maintain a good credit and it's one of the

819
00:47:20,581 --> 00:47:23,820
best things you can do with your kids.
Question,

820
00:47:24,810 --> 00:47:29,440
I wanted to ask you more about the
FBI specifically and kind of uh,

821
00:47:29,500 --> 00:47:32,950
hiring and how you got in. There is
such an interesting story. Um, you know,

822
00:47:32,980 --> 00:47:36,130
when I was younger I was really interested
in, you know, working for the FBI,

823
00:47:36,160 --> 00:47:39,940
worked in fraud and security.
Um, if my boss is watching,

824
00:47:39,941 --> 00:47:43,180
I'm very happy where I am
right now. Uh, but, uh,

825
00:47:43,210 --> 00:47:48,010
I couldn't believe how difficult it
was to try and get into public service.

826
00:47:48,011 --> 00:47:51,310
I thought, you know, there's, you
know, I was willing to take a pay cut.

827
00:47:51,311 --> 00:47:52,390
I was willing to move anywhere.

828
00:47:52,390 --> 00:47:55,180
I was willing to do anything
and it was difficult.

829
00:47:55,181 --> 00:47:58,660
I mean it was in touch with people at
the FBI and they were super nice and very

830
00:47:58,661 --> 00:48:01,210
helpful, but I just couldn't
believe that, you know,

831
00:48:01,240 --> 00:48:05,110
the background checks and there's no
available jobs and you have to keep

832
00:48:05,111 --> 00:48:09,220
emailing me and Oh you don't have a lot
of Gri. Oh that's not going to matter.

833
00:48:09,221 --> 00:48:12,790
And you know, again, I ended up in
a great spot so I'm happy. But uh,

834
00:48:13,150 --> 00:48:16,210
when people ask me about public service
and working for these organizations,

835
00:48:16,211 --> 00:48:19,870
I really don't have an answer.
The FBI is extremely tough.

836
00:48:19,930 --> 00:48:22,890
We have about 13,000 agents,
uh,

837
00:48:22,960 --> 00:48:27,250
and about 25,000 support people who
support the agent analysts and things of

838
00:48:27,251 --> 00:48:28,800
that nature.
Um,

839
00:48:29,400 --> 00:48:34,390
currently we'd take one in every
10,000 applicants to be an agent.

840
00:48:34,720 --> 00:48:37,780
So it is extremely
difficult to get in the FBI.

841
00:48:38,260 --> 00:48:42,790
So just to share the story with you,
my oldest boy, when he was about 14,

842
00:48:42,791 --> 00:48:45,730
I used to take my kids to the FBI Academy,

843
00:48:45,731 --> 00:48:48,550
which was on a marine military
base in Quantico, Virginia.

844
00:48:48,580 --> 00:48:51,640
Cause I like to shoot guns on the range
and I would take them up there and while

845
00:48:51,641 --> 00:48:54,730
I was teaching class, they would
be out there with the instructor,

846
00:48:55,030 --> 00:48:56,800
a shooting on the range.

847
00:48:56,801 --> 00:49:00,430
And I remember distinctly
coming back off the base,

848
00:49:00,431 --> 00:49:04,060
which takes you about 20 minutes to
get from the academy off to the base.

849
00:49:04,240 --> 00:49:06,970
And when we were riding through
the base, he said to me, no dad,

850
00:49:07,510 --> 00:49:10,860
this is what I want to do. I want
to become an FBI agent. I said,

851
00:49:10,880 --> 00:49:13,540
well that's great son, but
you know, keep that in mind.

852
00:49:13,541 --> 00:49:15,730
And so he graduated from high school.
He said to me,

853
00:49:15,731 --> 00:49:18,970
I really want to become a FBI agent.
I said, that's great. You know,

854
00:49:18,971 --> 00:49:22,300
you've got to go to college. So he
went to school at University of Kansas,

855
00:49:22,301 --> 00:49:26,720
got his undergraduate. He kept, I
always thought he changed his mind. Um,

856
00:49:26,860 --> 00:49:30,310
my wife always had a Christmas
party for all the agents in Tulsa.

857
00:49:30,311 --> 00:49:33,610
We had about 200 FBI agents in the state.
And uh,

858
00:49:33,700 --> 00:49:37,840
every Christmas they would be at our home
with their family and he would go talk

859
00:49:37,841 --> 00:49:38,471
to all of them.

860
00:49:38,471 --> 00:49:41,770
In the special agent in charge
who's in charge of the entire state.

861
00:49:42,190 --> 00:49:45,580
He would say to him, yeah, my
son tried to get in. But uh,

862
00:49:45,730 --> 00:49:49,990
they turned them down and he explained
to him that senator's sons had been

863
00:49:49,991 --> 00:49:52,720
turned down. Former president's
sons had been turned down,

864
00:49:53,080 --> 00:49:55,930
has nothing to do with
anything other than you.

865
00:49:55,990 --> 00:50:00,100
And I kept emphasizing that to him,
but I kept thinking he changed his mind.

866
00:50:00,100 --> 00:50:02,950
So when you graduated from
undergraduate scores said, Sanjay,

867
00:50:03,010 --> 00:50:06,400
I would recommend you go to law school.
I have no desire to be a lawyer. I said,

868
00:50:06,401 --> 00:50:07,001
I understand,

869
00:50:07,001 --> 00:50:10,840
but if you really want to pursue the
FBI and that would put you up a little

870
00:50:10,841 --> 00:50:14,710
higher and the chances of getting
in it went to Loyola School of law,

871
00:50:14,740 --> 00:50:18,010
graduated from law school.
Their bureau requires you pass the bar.

872
00:50:18,011 --> 00:50:19,270
So it took the bar in Illinois,

873
00:50:19,271 --> 00:50:23,290
passed the bar and then he went through
the year long process of the process to

874
00:50:23,291 --> 00:50:24,970
takes to apply to the bureau.

875
00:50:25,690 --> 00:50:28,940
And I got very worried because
I'd say to my wife that, you know,

876
00:50:28,941 --> 00:50:31,250
I'm a little concerned
because first of all,

877
00:50:31,280 --> 00:50:35,510
I don't know if someone in management
would like the fact that my son is an FBI

878
00:50:35,511 --> 00:50:38,990
agent, or maybe someone in
management would look at it and say,

879
00:50:38,991 --> 00:50:43,010
his dad has done so much for him,
for them, we need to look at his son.

880
00:50:43,220 --> 00:50:47,210
It had absolutely nothing to
do with that was all about him.

881
00:50:47,720 --> 00:50:52,420
And I always tell him every day he's
living his life a dream. So He's, he,

882
00:50:52,440 --> 00:50:55,190
he got in, but it is very, very tough.

883
00:50:55,191 --> 00:50:58,730
So when the bureau came to me
and they just a few years ago,

884
00:50:58,731 --> 00:51:00,410
celebrated their hundredth anniversary,

885
00:51:00,411 --> 00:51:04,130
they did a big coffee table book and
they talk about me in there as being the

886
00:51:04,131 --> 00:51:07,250
only person they ever did that with.
Uh,

887
00:51:07,940 --> 00:51:11,000
the whole thing to the bureau back then,
the director was Clarence Kelly,

888
00:51:11,030 --> 00:51:15,140
who was the director of the bureau
at that time. He wanted the ability,

889
00:51:15,141 --> 00:51:20,060
because he could say to me, okay,
you are a lieutenant in the army.

890
00:51:20,390 --> 00:51:24,800
You had been in the army this many years,
you're expertise is this missile.

891
00:51:25,310 --> 00:51:29,360
I need you to learn all of this and two
weeks and I'm sending you to this base

892
00:51:29,810 --> 00:51:32,990
and I want you to find out what's
going on in this particular area.

893
00:51:33,470 --> 00:51:37,400
He knew that no matter what assignment
he gave me undercover, I could go do it.

894
00:51:37,401 --> 00:51:39,830
Whether it was a scientist
at a lab in New Mexico,

895
00:51:40,010 --> 00:51:43,930
whether it was a doctor in a hospital,
he knew that I could get away with it,

896
00:51:43,950 --> 00:51:47,810
make it believe people believe that
I was that person without any doubt.

897
00:51:47,840 --> 00:51:50,840
And that's how they used me.
Um,

898
00:51:51,110 --> 00:51:55,700
I think that was their initial thing.
And then of course when my time was up,

899
00:51:55,701 --> 00:51:58,190
and again, keep in mind that
when I got that offer to me,

900
00:51:58,191 --> 00:52:02,770
it was just an opportunity. I
looked at it, well, opportunity
to get out of jail. I,

901
00:52:03,020 --> 00:52:05,480
I'm not going to sit here and
tell you I was a changed person,

902
00:52:05,810 --> 00:52:08,300
that I was a different person.
And when I went into prison,

903
00:52:08,510 --> 00:52:11,930
I just saw that as an opportunity to get
out of prison. So I was going to do it.

904
00:52:12,410 --> 00:52:13,243
But then I,

905
00:52:13,250 --> 00:52:17,450
you get involved with the men and women
of the FBI who obviously is probably the

906
00:52:17,451 --> 00:52:21,140
most ethical people you'll ever meet in
your life that have tremendous character,

907
00:52:21,141 --> 00:52:24,710
love of country, love of family.
That kind of wears off on you.

908
00:52:25,010 --> 00:52:27,710
And I started to realize that,
you know,

909
00:52:27,711 --> 00:52:31,340
I met my wife and I was becoming
a husband. I take care of my wife,

910
00:52:31,341 --> 00:52:33,680
had take care of children, uh, fatherhood,

911
00:52:33,710 --> 00:52:35,960
all those things is what
really changed my life.

912
00:52:35,961 --> 00:52:39,470
Wasn't that I was rehabilitated
or those things changed my life.

913
00:52:39,471 --> 00:52:41,540
So if it started out
more as an opportunity,

914
00:52:41,870 --> 00:52:46,250
so when my time was over and the court
said his court order is, ceases to be,

915
00:52:46,251 --> 00:52:48,170
he's free to do whatever he wants to do,

916
00:52:48,500 --> 00:52:53,500
I made the choice to stay there only
because I thought that I could bring a lot

917
00:52:54,201 --> 00:52:56,630
to the bureau.
So the bureau was very smart.

918
00:52:56,631 --> 00:53:00,020
They realize very early on that
I wouldn't be accepted very well.

919
00:53:00,050 --> 00:53:03,550
And so there was a great scene in
the movie where Steven Spielberg, uh,

920
00:53:03,630 --> 00:53:07,580
obviously knew that I was very,
very difficult for the agents.

921
00:53:07,610 --> 00:53:10,430
You gotta keep in mind now this is
back when there were no women agents,

922
00:53:10,431 --> 00:53:12,080
no blacks,
no Hispanics,

923
00:53:12,081 --> 00:53:15,410
everybody was white agent and they
either graduated from Harvard or the

924
00:53:15,411 --> 00:53:19,910
graduated from Yale and they all came
from very good families and it was a

925
00:53:19,911 --> 00:53:22,010
totally different
environment 40 years ago.

926
00:53:22,310 --> 00:53:25,950
So they all have really tunnel
vision once a criminal, a criminal.

927
00:53:26,190 --> 00:53:29,820
So they were not very, very happy
with the fact that I came there.

928
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:33,400
So he showed that scene and me
walking in the office and, uh,

929
00:53:33,730 --> 00:53:37,620
the way people looked at me, that
took years for me to turn that around,

930
00:53:37,621 --> 00:53:40,290
took years for me to
build their credibility.

931
00:53:40,290 --> 00:53:43,350
And of course in the first part
of my career was out in the field,

932
00:53:43,380 --> 00:53:45,990
so as undercover,
so there really weren't dealing with me.

933
00:53:46,470 --> 00:53:50,790
So when I finished working on the cover
that the director then simply said,

934
00:53:50,791 --> 00:53:51,251
you know what?

935
00:53:51,251 --> 00:53:55,260
It needs to go to the academy and teach
class so that every agent who comes to

936
00:53:55,261 --> 00:53:56,940
the academy,
they will,

937
00:53:56,941 --> 00:54:01,410
he will be their instructor in one of
their courses and they will all know him.

938
00:54:01,500 --> 00:54:04,860
So I've taught at the academy
now for well over 35 years.

939
00:54:04,861 --> 00:54:08,970
I taught my son when he went through the
academy, three generations of agents.

940
00:54:09,190 --> 00:54:12,420
And that helped a great deal because
they learned who I was early on,

941
00:54:12,450 --> 00:54:15,810
knew who I was. And that changed a lot
of that. But it took a lot of, lot of,

942
00:54:15,870 --> 00:54:18,750
lot of work to turn that around
and build that credibility.

943
00:54:20,040 --> 00:54:24,690
I'm curious to know whether or not you
continued to fly even after you were

944
00:54:24,691 --> 00:54:29,400
released from jail and working at
the bureau as the movie suggests,

945
00:54:29,401 --> 00:54:33,410
or if that was a bit of Hollywood in now.
You know, when people ask me, um, and I,

946
00:54:33,420 --> 00:54:37,020
I saw the movie in a movie theater.
I've only seen the movie twice.

947
00:54:37,050 --> 00:54:40,560
I've seen that trailer a thousand times,
but I've only seen the movie twice.

948
00:54:40,920 --> 00:54:44,910
So when the media asks me what I thought
about the movie and what was right and

949
00:54:44,911 --> 00:54:47,310
what was wrong, I said, you
know, well, first of all,

950
00:54:47,311 --> 00:54:51,830
I have two brothers and a
sister. He portrayed, portrayed
me as an only child, uh,

951
00:54:51,840 --> 00:54:53,820
in real life.
My mother never remarried.

952
00:54:53,821 --> 00:54:56,790
There's a scene in the movie where
she's remarried as a little girl.

953
00:54:56,791 --> 00:54:59,730
That didn't really happen,
um, in the real life.

954
00:54:59,731 --> 00:55:03,180
I never saw my father after
I ran away, uh, in the movie,

955
00:55:03,181 --> 00:55:06,720
they keep having him come
back to Christopher Walken
and the film was nominated

956
00:55:06,721 --> 00:55:10,350
for the Academy award for
that role as my father. Uh,

957
00:55:10,720 --> 00:55:14,280
that didn't really happen.
I escaped off the aircraft,

958
00:55:14,281 --> 00:55:17,340
but I escaped off the aircraft through
the kitchen gallery where they bring the

959
00:55:17,341 --> 00:55:18,990
food and stuff onto the plane.

960
00:55:18,991 --> 00:55:23,160
And there they had made scape through
the toilet and my wife kind of looked at

961
00:55:23,161 --> 00:55:25,170
me and said, you didn't go through
the toilet. They yes and no.

962
00:55:25,230 --> 00:55:27,480
I didn't go through the toilet.
Um,

963
00:55:28,200 --> 00:55:31,980
so I thought he stayed very
close to the story. But, um,

964
00:55:32,700 --> 00:55:34,590
pretty much all of that was,
he was,

965
00:55:34,620 --> 00:55:38,410
he was very concerned about being
accurate first of all, because it was a,

966
00:55:38,510 --> 00:55:42,590
it was the first time he made a movie
about a real person living second.

967
00:55:42,591 --> 00:55:45,840
The bureau had an information
officer on the set for all the,

968
00:55:46,080 --> 00:55:50,400
all the shooting of the entire film to
make sure that what he said about the FBI

969
00:55:50,401 --> 00:55:54,120
and what comments they made and
all that was accurate. The agent,

970
00:55:54,150 --> 00:55:57,420
there was an agent from our
information officer on the, on the set,

971
00:55:57,421 --> 00:55:59,490
and then of course is he later said,

972
00:55:59,491 --> 00:56:03,750
I really got most of my information from
those three retired agents because they

973
00:56:03,751 --> 00:56:08,250
said they, their notes were
so particular and so accurate.

974
00:56:08,250 --> 00:56:11,760
He said that when I filmed
the scene in the hotel room,

975
00:56:12,060 --> 00:56:15,840
I had scripted it.
And so we're sitting there and I said,

976
00:56:15,841 --> 00:56:19,350
a read me your notes. He said, I
entered the room with my gun pulled,

977
00:56:19,530 --> 00:56:21,090
I heard someone in the bathroom,

978
00:56:21,450 --> 00:56:24,820
I ordered them to come out of the
bathroom and this is what happened.

979
00:56:25,150 --> 00:56:28,190
He basically loved his notes
better than his script.

980
00:56:28,191 --> 00:56:30,790
So he used his notes
for the southern film.

981
00:56:30,791 --> 00:56:35,650
So I thought he did a good job of staying
a very, uh, very accurate. The movie.

982
00:56:36,040 --> 00:56:39,310
I just make a final common to,
uh, having to deal with cyber.

983
00:56:39,311 --> 00:56:42,790
Now I like to write about
crimes in the future. Uh,

984
00:56:42,791 --> 00:56:47,791
so I always used to write to my class
about what will we investigate five years

985
00:56:48,431 --> 00:56:51,730
from now, what will the agent
be doing five years from now?

986
00:56:52,510 --> 00:56:56,680
And unfortunately, um, there's good
news and there's bad news. First of all,

987
00:56:56,681 --> 00:57:00,610
the good news, we will be doing a way
with passwords in the next 24 months.

988
00:57:00,640 --> 00:57:04,030
Passwords will leave the world.
There will be no more passwords.

989
00:57:04,690 --> 00:57:09,190
There is a new technology called
True Sona. That's t r U. S.

990
00:57:09,191 --> 00:57:13,570
O n a stands for true persona.
It is a company in Scottsdale,

991
00:57:13,571 --> 00:57:16,510
Arizona that created a
technology for the CIA,

992
00:57:16,900 --> 00:57:21,250
which we have used now for the last
few years. That technology. Uh,

993
00:57:21,251 --> 00:57:24,790
and I was an advisor on
that technology for the CIA.

994
00:57:24,880 --> 00:57:28,060
So I'm an advisor and bringing
it to the commercial world.

995
00:57:28,570 --> 00:57:33,460
But it was the ability for an agent to
send data back from the fields such as

996
00:57:33,461 --> 00:57:35,530
Afghanistan on their iPhone.

997
00:57:36,070 --> 00:57:41,070
And that Langley would know 100% that
is the agent on the other end to 100%

998
00:57:42,851 --> 00:57:46,030
identify the person on the
other end of the device.

999
00:57:46,630 --> 00:57:50,410
That's a level for security.
So that they basically said,

1000
00:57:50,411 --> 00:57:53,140
what if we brought this
to level two security?

1001
00:57:53,500 --> 00:57:55,630
And we did away with passwords.

1002
00:57:55,930 --> 00:58:00,460
So immediately when they announced that
Microsoft gave them $10 million and said,

1003
00:58:00,461 --> 00:58:04,000
I'm in develop it, so Microsoft is
going to use it on all their gaming,

1004
00:58:04,001 --> 00:58:05,680
all their access to their computers,

1005
00:58:06,160 --> 00:58:11,160
etc. We now have the ability to identify
who the person is on the other end of

1006
00:58:11,231 --> 00:58:14,650
that, uh, device. And when you
go to their website at True Sona,

1007
00:58:14,920 --> 00:58:16,510
they actually show you how it's done.

1008
00:58:16,540 --> 00:58:19,760
So they show you the demo videos there
that are three or four minutes long that

1009
00:58:19,761 --> 00:58:21,820
show you how it's done.
And that's great.

1010
00:58:21,821 --> 00:58:24,310
Passports or stack of
passwords are stagnant.

1011
00:58:24,311 --> 00:58:26,020
They should have been gone long time ago.

1012
00:58:26,021 --> 00:58:28,480
It's why we have most of the
problems that we have today.

1013
00:58:28,720 --> 00:58:31,120
So it is very important that
we get rid of passwords.

1014
00:58:31,121 --> 00:58:35,110
And just in case you didn't know,
if we take a bank like a bank of America,

1015
00:58:35,350 --> 00:58:38,860
they spend about $6 million
a month in their call center,

1016
00:58:39,400 --> 00:58:42,760
resetting passwords,
cost them $6 million a month.

1017
00:58:42,790 --> 00:58:47,020
So that would save that bank $100
million a year to eliminate the use of

1018
00:58:47,380 --> 00:58:49,810
passwords.
So that's the good part of it.

1019
00:58:49,811 --> 00:58:52,630
And I think that will eventually do
away with social security numbers.

1020
00:58:52,840 --> 00:58:56,110
You'll still have a number assigned
to you for the government purpose.

1021
00:58:56,320 --> 00:58:58,690
But when I go buy a car,
I go to the doctor,

1022
00:58:58,691 --> 00:59:01,900
I don't have to give them a number because
they already know who I am through my

1023
00:59:01,901 --> 00:59:04,600
device. I won't have to provide
a social security number.

1024
00:59:04,900 --> 00:59:06,280
So I think that's the good part.

1025
00:59:06,670 --> 00:59:11,670
But I do believe that cyber it up until
this point in time has been used for

1026
00:59:12,311 --> 00:59:17,260
financial crimes or gathering data
and information, which is a value.

1027
00:59:17,620 --> 00:59:21,830
What's going to happen is we're going to
see cyber very quickly now turned black.

1028
00:59:22,850 --> 00:59:25,310
So we have the ability, as you know, uh,

1029
00:59:25,340 --> 00:59:28,190
to basically shut someone's pacemaker off,

1030
00:59:28,490 --> 00:59:30,500
but we have to be within 35 feet of them.

1031
00:59:30,500 --> 00:59:33,440
We test these device at
Quantico all the time.

1032
00:59:34,040 --> 00:59:36,410
So as long as I walk up
within 35 feet of you,

1033
00:59:36,411 --> 00:59:39,470
I take control of any bodily
device you have on you.

1034
00:59:39,500 --> 00:59:42,950
So if I want to assassinate you, I
want to speed it up, take it down,

1035
00:59:43,130 --> 00:59:43,970
I can do that.

1036
00:59:44,450 --> 00:59:49,430
But I believe that in five years you'll
be able to do that from 5,000 miles away.

1037
00:59:50,270 --> 00:59:51,230
We have the ability,

1038
00:59:51,231 --> 00:59:54,260
now that we test that we can
chase a car down the interstate.

1039
00:59:54,261 --> 00:59:58,100
We got to get up with them 35 feet of
the vehicle. We take over the vehicle,

1040
00:59:58,400 --> 01:00:01,490
we shut the motor off,
we lock the person in the car,

1041
01:00:01,520 --> 01:00:05,260
we locked the power windows so they can't
open them and we can turn on their air

1042
01:00:05,261 --> 01:00:07,790
bag again.
Five years from now,

1043
01:00:07,850 --> 01:00:11,990
you'd be able to do that 5,000 miles away.
So yes,

1044
01:00:11,991 --> 01:00:14,810
our electrical grid uses a terrorist tool.

1045
01:00:14,870 --> 01:00:19,810
The ability to shut down an entire system,
shut down an entire banking system. Uh,

1046
01:00:19,850 --> 01:00:23,600
those are all the things
that unfortunately we'll
be dealing with in the next

1047
01:00:23,780 --> 01:00:28,780
four or five a year as cyber starts to
make that turn to the very black side of

1048
01:00:29,540 --> 01:00:33,920
cyber, not just about stealing
money, information and data. And, uh,

1049
01:00:33,980 --> 01:00:37,820
so that's why we're going to have to
work extra hard to make sure that we go

1050
01:00:37,821 --> 01:00:39,740
back to protect our electrical grid.
We,

1051
01:00:39,741 --> 01:00:44,741
I always remind people we
have the technology to prevent
most of these problems,

1052
01:00:45,410 --> 01:00:47,450
but if you don't use it,
then it's worthless.

1053
01:00:48,050 --> 01:00:52,760
And we tend to develop a lot of things.
Uh, I just want to make this emphasis,

1054
01:00:52,761 --> 01:00:56,390
do we develop a lot of things
without following them through?

1055
01:00:56,480 --> 01:00:59,720
So one thing I've done in the
government over the last several years,

1056
01:00:59,721 --> 01:01:01,760
if the government is
going to buy a technology,

1057
01:01:02,210 --> 01:01:05,630
they send me to the technology
company and say, try to defeat that.

1058
01:01:06,320 --> 01:01:10,550
I could simply go there and see their
technology has one CEO says he plays chess

1059
01:01:10,551 --> 01:01:12,740
with you. You tell me you
did this, this, and this,

1060
01:01:13,100 --> 01:01:15,740
and then he tells you we have a weakness
right here because I would come in and

1061
01:01:15,741 --> 01:01:18,740
do this. So they build a
wall up and then he says, no,

1062
01:01:18,741 --> 01:01:23,420
I would still get in here until he says
he can't do it any longer than we know.

1063
01:01:23,421 --> 01:01:27,280
We have a good technology,
but very rarely is an,

1064
01:01:27,290 --> 01:01:32,150
I did that with true sona when we did it
for the purpose of the CIA. But today,

1065
01:01:32,330 --> 01:01:36,920
uh, you, and it tells you on the website
that I advised in that project and why,

1066
01:01:36,921 --> 01:01:38,840
how it became down to commercial use.

1067
01:01:39,200 --> 01:01:43,190
But today what we have is we
develop things. So we say to you,

1068
01:01:43,191 --> 01:01:44,660
here's a device you put in your kitchen,

1069
01:01:44,661 --> 01:01:47,720
and then you can talk to her to tell you,
ask what the weather is, what's on TV,

1070
01:01:47,721 --> 01:01:49,730
denied. Um, all of that,

1071
01:01:49,750 --> 01:01:53,270
that I could easily reverse
that and listen to everything
you say in your house.

1072
01:01:53,650 --> 01:01:55,550
There are so many weaknesses in your home.

1073
01:01:55,730 --> 01:02:00,290
Your security cameras or access points,
your remote control on your TV,

1074
01:02:00,291 --> 01:02:04,940
your Samsung television,
your refrigerator, that
tells you how much, uh, milk,

1075
01:02:04,941 --> 01:02:05,774
isn't it?

1076
01:02:06,140 --> 01:02:10,160
My thing is I really don't need my
refrigerator to talk to my toaster.

1077
01:02:10,220 --> 01:02:13,910
They've gotten along for a long time
without ever having a conversation.

1078
01:02:14,180 --> 01:02:18,050
But what happens is we develop something
we get real excited about where I get

1079
01:02:18,051 --> 01:02:22,380
this to the marketplace. And sure enough,
we never look at the negative side.

1080
01:02:22,620 --> 01:02:25,860
All I tried to say to a technology
company, yeah, this is great.

1081
01:02:26,280 --> 01:02:28,320
Now can you take a
little time to just say,

1082
01:02:28,321 --> 01:02:33,321
how would someone use this technology
and the negative self serving way so that

1083
01:02:34,471 --> 01:02:39,180
we build the block to that before we ever
give it to the public to use it. We'd,

1084
01:02:39,210 --> 01:02:40,590
we'd save a lot of problems.

1085
01:02:40,890 --> 01:02:42,630
Been absolute pleasure
spending the morning with you.

1086
01:02:42,631 --> 01:02:43,810
Thank you very much for coming.

1087
01:02:44,230 --> 01:02:49,230
[inaudible].
