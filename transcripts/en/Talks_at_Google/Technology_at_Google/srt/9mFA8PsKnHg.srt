1
00:00:05,970 --> 00:00:06,940
Like many of you,

2
00:00:06,941 --> 00:00:11,941
I'm very curious about the future of
blockchain and how it might integrate into

3
00:00:13,540 --> 00:00:17,180
various frameworks of our society.
Uh,

4
00:00:17,710 --> 00:00:21,550
and for that we have a
very special guest today,

5
00:00:21,670 --> 00:00:24,130
Dr Tonika Tillaman.
Uh,

6
00:00:24,290 --> 00:00:28,630
Dr Tillaman is the chairman of the
global blockchain business council.

7
00:00:29,290 --> 00:00:33,160
He's a co founder of the
blockchain trust accelerator.

8
00:00:33,710 --> 00:00:37,630
He is a member of the advisory
board of the bid fury group,

9
00:00:37,660 --> 00:00:42,010
which is a leading food service
blockchain company. Great. So, um,

10
00:00:42,040 --> 00:00:47,040
I'm sure most of you guys are
already familiar with blockchain and

11
00:00:47,111 --> 00:00:49,840
cryptocurrencies. Uh, but the Mica,

12
00:00:49,841 --> 00:00:52,450
can you please just very
briefly explain those concepts?

13
00:00:52,810 --> 00:00:53,441
Absolutely.

14
00:00:53,441 --> 00:00:57,910
And I should clarify that I spend most
of my time explaining these concepts to

15
00:00:57,911 --> 00:01:02,911
audiences that maybe spend a lot of time
working on high level policy issues or

16
00:01:03,551 --> 00:01:05,800
a c level executives in big corporations,

17
00:01:06,010 --> 00:01:09,760
but don't know that much about technology.
I realized that is not the case today.

18
00:01:09,761 --> 00:01:14,761
So I am thrilled to have an audience
here that I'm sure we'll have incredible

19
00:01:14,801 --> 00:01:18,910
insights on the technical aspects of
this technology beyond some of the policy

20
00:01:18,911 --> 00:01:21,880
and business, uh, components that
we're going to discuss today.

21
00:01:22,100 --> 00:01:25,460
Block chain at its core is just a record.
It's,

22
00:01:25,500 --> 00:01:28,540
it's a very simple concept
to wrap your head around.

23
00:01:28,541 --> 00:01:33,250
Humanity has been using records for about
5,500 years since the time of Sumerian

24
00:01:33,251 --> 00:01:36,640
tablets. So in that sense,
this is not something that new,

25
00:01:36,940 --> 00:01:40,680
but it has two dimensions
that are big innovations.

26
00:01:40,690 --> 00:01:42,100
So when you put those together,

27
00:01:42,250 --> 00:01:45,700
it unlocks functionality that we
have never had access to before.

28
00:01:46,120 --> 00:01:49,420
The first thing to know about blockchain
is that it is distributed. Uh,

29
00:01:49,421 --> 00:01:53,410
it is stored in the case of Bitcoin
blockchain on thousands of computers all

30
00:01:53,411 --> 00:01:56,830
over the world. All of those
computers contain an identical,

31
00:01:57,160 --> 00:01:59,440
identical copy of the record.

32
00:01:59,470 --> 00:02:03,670
And what that means is that
they're constantly checking
each other to ensure its

33
00:02:03,671 --> 00:02:07,960
accuracy and integrity. Uh, so that's
one important dimension of this.

34
00:02:08,200 --> 00:02:10,420
The second is that it is permanent.

35
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:15,720
Once a piece of data is entered into a
data block and walked into that chain,

36
00:02:16,900 --> 00:02:20,980
hence the name, you can't change
it. You can update the information,

37
00:02:21,010 --> 00:02:22,930
but you can never erase the information.

38
00:02:23,230 --> 00:02:27,880
So if a government wants to wipe out the,
the contents of a blockchain,

39
00:02:27,910 --> 00:02:31,990
it can't do it. Uh, if a company wants
to wipe out the contents of a blockchain,

40
00:02:32,020 --> 00:02:37,000
it can't do it. They are designed to be
incredibly resilient and incredibly, uh,

41
00:02:37,001 --> 00:02:38,380
secure.
Uh,

42
00:02:38,381 --> 00:02:42,220
and those are very important
when it comes to this,

43
00:02:42,221 --> 00:02:46,690
this permanence that we're talking about.
When you put those two pieces together,

44
00:02:46,750 --> 00:02:50,950
uh, the distributed nature of the record
and the permanent nature of the record,

45
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:55,630
it provides the opportunity to do some
things that we've never been able to do

46
00:02:55,631 --> 00:02:58,870
before.
It is an independent source of,

47
00:02:59,740 --> 00:03:01,990
for any information that you put in,

48
00:03:02,020 --> 00:03:06,250
you can validate that something was
created at the time you say it was created

49
00:03:06,700 --> 00:03:08,770
because it's logged in the blockchain.
And again,

50
00:03:08,771 --> 00:03:11,270
nobody can monkey with it once it's there.
Uh,

51
00:03:11,290 --> 00:03:14,410
you can assure that a boat
has been tabulated correctly.

52
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:18,990
If it's hash to the blockchain, you
can ensure that a property record, uh,

53
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:22,060
has been registered in the way that
it's supposed to be registered.

54
00:03:22,510 --> 00:03:27,440
It has the potential by virtue of
this independent distributed, uh,

55
00:03:27,450 --> 00:03:32,260
and permanent functionality, uh, to
solve a lot of problems around trust.

56
00:03:32,290 --> 00:03:36,400
A lot of problems around corruption and
a lot of problems around transparency.

57
00:03:36,670 --> 00:03:40,030
And those are all big issues that we
are wrestling with in the world today.

58
00:03:40,031 --> 00:03:41,020
And because of that,

59
00:03:41,021 --> 00:03:45,130
I feel it's a very important technology
for all of us to hopefully put our arms

60
00:03:45,131 --> 00:03:45,964
around.

61
00:03:46,180 --> 00:03:47,650
I agree.
Um,

62
00:03:48,190 --> 00:03:53,190
do you think there's any doubt at this
point that blockchain technology is going

63
00:03:53,201 --> 00:03:54,340
to become mainstream?

64
00:03:54,610 --> 00:03:56,100
That's a great question.
Uh,

65
00:03:56,101 --> 00:04:00,730
I think blockchain technology today is
in very much the same place that the

66
00:04:00,731 --> 00:04:05,020
Internet was in about 1993 or 1994.
Uh,

67
00:04:05,021 --> 00:04:08,890
and what that means is that this
could go any number of directions.

68
00:04:08,891 --> 00:04:13,090
There is no a fore ordained
course for the technology,

69
00:04:13,420 --> 00:04:17,770
but the functionality is
incredibly important. And again,

70
00:04:17,771 --> 00:04:21,760
the functionality enables us to do so
many things that we'd never been able to

71
00:04:21,761 --> 00:04:26,290
do before, that the functionality probably
isn't going anywhere. Theoretically,

72
00:04:26,291 --> 00:04:30,220
somebody could come along with a
technology that will provide that same

73
00:04:30,221 --> 00:04:35,221
functionality in a way that is potentially
a little bit cheaper or potentially a

74
00:04:35,411 --> 00:04:36,490
little bit more efficient.

75
00:04:36,830 --> 00:04:41,470
So that could theoretically again
derail adoption of the technology. Uh,

76
00:04:41,500 --> 00:04:45,160
but in terms of what it can
do that is here to stay.

77
00:04:45,260 --> 00:04:50,110
And I would imagine, I would expect that
it will become a ubiquitous technology,

78
00:04:50,270 --> 00:04:51,910
uh,
in the course of coming years.

79
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:57,810
Uh, so with your experience in
politics and civic and institution,

80
00:04:58,020 --> 00:04:59,190
can you describe,
uh,

81
00:04:59,290 --> 00:05:04,290
your vision for global
adoption of blockchain and
what are the key steps in this

82
00:05:05,311 --> 00:05:06,144
transition

83
00:05:06,250 --> 00:05:06,490
that,

84
00:05:06,490 --> 00:05:09,940
that is a big question and we could
probably spend the better part of our time

85
00:05:09,941 --> 00:05:14,350
here discussing that. Um, a
couple of things. First, Bitcoin,

86
00:05:14,380 --> 00:05:18,430
which is the application of blockchain
that most people are familiar with.

87
00:05:18,431 --> 00:05:20,940
And again,
I imagine it is a,

88
00:05:21,010 --> 00:05:24,910
not a news announcement
to those in this room. Uh,

89
00:05:24,950 --> 00:05:29,950
but blockchain was originally developed
as the rails to power bitcoin and has

90
00:05:30,281 --> 00:05:34,320
since been adapted into a variety
of different applications. Um,

91
00:05:34,540 --> 00:05:38,860
bitcoin is already gaining pretty
broad global adoption and eh,

92
00:05:38,890 --> 00:05:43,630
the first place where you are likely to
see blockchain applications take hold a

93
00:05:43,730 --> 00:05:45,520
is in financial technology.

94
00:05:45,820 --> 00:05:50,050
IBM came out with a survey a little
while ago that estimated that in the next

95
00:05:50,051 --> 00:05:51,070
three years,

96
00:05:51,190 --> 00:05:55,300
65% of all big banks are
going to be using blockchain.

97
00:05:55,710 --> 00:05:59,210
So this is a technology in that space,
certainly as it,

98
00:05:59,211 --> 00:06:03,230
as it relates to payments as it relates
to moving money and financial assets

99
00:06:03,231 --> 00:06:06,560
back and forth, uh, has kind of
already reached the tipping point.

100
00:06:06,590 --> 00:06:10,820
That train has left the station. So
that's stage one. That's exciting.

101
00:06:10,821 --> 00:06:11,451
There is again,

102
00:06:11,451 --> 00:06:16,010
a misperception that this is something
that is going to happen soon in practice.

103
00:06:16,011 --> 00:06:18,940
This is something that is
happening right now. Uh, so, uh,

104
00:06:18,980 --> 00:06:22,940
don't anticipate that it's going to be
years and years before you see those use

105
00:06:22,941 --> 00:06:23,900
cases rolling out.

106
00:06:24,380 --> 00:06:29,380
The second piece of this will happen
when you see adoption and what I call a

107
00:06:29,420 --> 00:06:34,400
intact or institutional technology.
Uh, some people call it Gov tech.

108
00:06:34,760 --> 00:06:34,941
Uh,

109
00:06:34,941 --> 00:06:39,470
but these are the entities that validate
the facts that make up kind of the base

110
00:06:39,471 --> 00:06:42,590
layer of reality that we
all have to agree on. And,

111
00:06:42,740 --> 00:06:46,580
and here I'm going to pause and kind of
zoom way back for a moment if you will

112
00:06:46,581 --> 00:06:51,290
forgive me. Yaka uh, there was a,
another great, uh, toxic Google speaker,

113
00:06:51,350 --> 00:06:56,350
a historian named Yuval Hariri who asked
an important question a couple of years

114
00:06:56,510 --> 00:06:58,850
ago. He said, why are
humans in charge? Why,

115
00:06:58,851 --> 00:07:03,110
why are we the ones that run the
planet and not fish or rang a tanks?

116
00:07:03,111 --> 00:07:05,750
Because theoretically it could
be Jelly Fisher Orangutans.

117
00:07:06,230 --> 00:07:09,950
And what he recognized is that humans
are able to do two things that other

118
00:07:09,951 --> 00:07:14,180
species can't do. The first is
that we can cooperate flexibly. Uh,

119
00:07:14,270 --> 00:07:16,550
and the second is that we
can cooperate at scale.

120
00:07:16,700 --> 00:07:20,570
So if you look at other species,
you find some that can cooperate flexibly,

121
00:07:20,571 --> 00:07:21,860
like wolves and dolphins,

122
00:07:22,070 --> 00:07:25,550
you find some that can cooperate
at scale like bees or ants,

123
00:07:25,820 --> 00:07:28,160
but nobody else can do
the two of those together.

124
00:07:28,520 --> 00:07:33,520
The way that we are able to do that is
we come to a consensus on kind of a base

125
00:07:34,461 --> 00:07:38,900
layer of reality, a certain set of facts
that everyone is willing to sign up for.

126
00:07:39,260 --> 00:07:40,580
And once we do that,

127
00:07:40,610 --> 00:07:45,610
we're able to go off and in many different
verticals pursue our own individual

128
00:07:46,251 --> 00:07:48,980
agendas on the basis
of those common facts.

129
00:07:49,400 --> 00:07:54,400
What blockchain is going to allow us to
do potentially is create a new form of

130
00:07:54,531 --> 00:07:59,360
consensus around basic
facts. And that is if, again,

131
00:07:59,361 --> 00:08:01,160
if we do it right,
uh,

132
00:08:01,190 --> 00:08:04,760
a solution that has the potential
to supercharge collaboration,

133
00:08:04,761 --> 00:08:09,440
to supercharge cooperation in ways that
we've never been able to work together

134
00:08:09,441 --> 00:08:10,880
previously.
Um,

135
00:08:10,881 --> 00:08:15,620
and so as you see institutions
that keep track of who owns what,

136
00:08:16,040 --> 00:08:17,620
who voted for whom,
uh,

137
00:08:17,660 --> 00:08:22,160
who owns which piece of property
start to move their activities on the

138
00:08:22,161 --> 00:08:22,994
blockchain,

139
00:08:23,240 --> 00:08:28,190
you're going to see a very big new chapter
in the history of human cooperation.

140
00:08:28,440 --> 00:08:30,470
Uh, and, and that's
going to be really cool.

141
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:35,240
What happens at that stage I would
suggest is that we're likely to see the

142
00:08:35,241 --> 00:08:40,040
emergence of business models that we find
it difficult to even conceive of right

143
00:08:40,041 --> 00:08:43,350
now. But business models
that take advantage of, uh,

144
00:08:43,410 --> 00:08:47,020
the tokenization of assets,
uh, where we take a,

145
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:50,480
anything that we have a chair, a car, uh,

146
00:08:50,481 --> 00:08:55,481
I have kilowatt of energy and have the
ability to transfer that back and forth

147
00:08:55,501 --> 00:08:58,470
seamlessly.
If you think about the last 20 years,

148
00:08:58,471 --> 00:09:03,450
what you and others at Google had been
working on a is really facilitating the

149
00:09:03,480 --> 00:09:08,430
frictionless peer to peer exchange of
information and what blockchains should

150
00:09:08,431 --> 00:09:10,060
enable us to do,
uh,

151
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:13,890
is engaged in the frictionless
peer to peer exchange of assets.

152
00:09:14,190 --> 00:09:16,080
Once we hit that tipping point,

153
00:09:16,140 --> 00:09:18,630
a lot of exciting things are
going to happen really quickly.

154
00:09:18,990 --> 00:09:22,200
I'll stop talking there. That's
a very long, complicated answer.

155
00:09:22,680 --> 00:09:23,211
Okay.
Uh,

156
00:09:23,211 --> 00:09:27,450
I want to ask specifically
about governments because
the ironman traditionally

157
00:09:27,451 --> 00:09:32,340
are one of the, you know,
latest adopters of technology.

158
00:09:32,850 --> 00:09:37,850
And how do you think a government might
adopt blockchain either as a currency or

159
00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:42,580
for administration and vendor?
You think that might mean?

160
00:09:43,170 --> 00:09:47,820
That's a another very good
question. Um, so two pieces. Uh,

161
00:09:47,821 --> 00:09:50,850
first,
how will governments use blockchain?

162
00:09:51,370 --> 00:09:55,170
I would suggest that the first
iterations of government, uh,

163
00:09:55,171 --> 00:10:00,171
utilization of blockchain technology
will be focused on how you can provide an

164
00:10:01,530 --> 00:10:05,940
added level of assurance
around data integrity. Uh,

165
00:10:05,941 --> 00:10:07,770
and this is already happening.

166
00:10:07,860 --> 00:10:12,480
A project that we have been heavily
involved in a is moving the country of

167
00:10:12,481 --> 00:10:16,800
Georgia as land registry on a blockchain.
Why would you want to do this?

168
00:10:16,801 --> 00:10:19,920
Why would you care about putting
a land registry on blockchain?

169
00:10:20,280 --> 00:10:21,750
In many parts of the world,

170
00:10:21,810 --> 00:10:26,640
if Jasmine has a nice piece of property
by the lake and I want it and my cousin

171
00:10:26,641 --> 00:10:29,940
works for the land registry,
I go and talk to my cousin,

172
00:10:29,970 --> 00:10:32,040
my cousin's signs that
property over to me.

173
00:10:32,220 --> 00:10:35,100
And because the registry
controls the record,

174
00:10:35,280 --> 00:10:38,950
there's nothing that you can do about it.
You are out of luck at that point. Uh,

175
00:10:38,960 --> 00:10:42,000
and it would be nice to say
this is an isolated phenomenon.

176
00:10:42,001 --> 00:10:43,770
This is not an isolated phenomenon.

177
00:10:43,771 --> 00:10:46,290
This is something that happens
on a very regular basis.

178
00:10:46,740 --> 00:10:50,970
So if you work in a country or live
in a country where people have those

179
00:10:50,971 --> 00:10:51,900
concerns,

180
00:10:52,110 --> 00:10:57,110
if you can take those registries and
move them into a format where even if

181
00:10:57,391 --> 00:11:01,380
you've got a corrupt official
with access to the information,

182
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:06,000
they can't go in and wipe out the
evidence that it was Jasmine's property to

183
00:11:06,001 --> 00:11:07,800
begin with.
That's a big deal.

184
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:10,290
And citizens are going to
sleep a lot better at night,

185
00:11:10,470 --> 00:11:15,030
especially when it is a in conjunction
with something as important and

186
00:11:15,031 --> 00:11:19,920
fundamental as your home. So those would
be the, the early iterations. And again,

187
00:11:19,921 --> 00:11:23,040
that's already happening.
A Georgia system is active.

188
00:11:23,041 --> 00:11:26,580
It has about 200,000 records
according to the World Bank.

189
00:11:26,580 --> 00:11:30,540
It is now the number one system in
the world, uh, for land registration.

190
00:11:30,541 --> 00:11:34,860
So we've seen good progress there.
A Dubai, his pledge, the by 2020,

191
00:11:34,861 --> 00:11:36,790
they want all of their government,
uh,

192
00:11:36,840 --> 00:11:39,840
transactions to be taking
place on blockchain.

193
00:11:40,050 --> 00:11:44,430
Ukraine has committed to moving all of
their transactions on the blockchain and

194
00:11:44,431 --> 00:11:48,480
we see many other countries around the
world that are starting to dabble in this,

195
00:11:48,870 --> 00:11:49,920
in the United States.

196
00:11:49,921 --> 00:11:53,890
We've worked over the last year with
about eight government agencies that are

197
00:11:53,891 --> 00:11:58,570
investigating different use cases for
blockchain and starting to stand up their

198
00:11:58,571 --> 00:12:02,050
own pilots. Uh, there's enormous
potential there. And again,

199
00:12:02,051 --> 00:12:06,370
at a moment when we are facing a
real crisis of confidence of trust in

200
00:12:06,371 --> 00:12:07,204
institutions,

201
00:12:07,420 --> 00:12:11,820
this has the potential to be a very
valuable tool for governments who are, uh,

202
00:12:11,980 --> 00:12:16,980
working desperately to Regaine and win
back some of the confidence of their

203
00:12:17,051 --> 00:12:17,884
citizens.

204
00:12:18,850 --> 00:12:21,890
Uh, what about the pushback
of the corrupt official?

205
00:12:21,891 --> 00:12:23,640
It's like how have they overcome that?

206
00:12:23,680 --> 00:12:26,560
Do people have the power
to overcome that pushback?

207
00:12:26,790 --> 00:12:31,530
That's said very good question. Uh,
and you see kind of two dynamics.

208
00:12:31,860 --> 00:12:33,810
There's some countries and you know,

209
00:12:33,811 --> 00:12:38,811
I speak now as somebody who spent the
better part of the last decade working in

210
00:12:39,390 --> 00:12:43,170
nations around the world that we're
struggling with issues of governance and

211
00:12:43,171 --> 00:12:46,030
trying to get their democracies
to function properly. Uh,

212
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:50,970
there's some countries where the leaders
in charge don't want any transparency

213
00:12:50,971 --> 00:12:52,560
and don't want any accountability.

214
00:12:52,950 --> 00:12:57,120
And I would be very surprised if you
see many of those countries adopting

215
00:12:57,150 --> 00:12:58,260
blockchain technology.

216
00:12:58,770 --> 00:13:03,770
There is another pretty wide swath of
countries where people in charge actually

217
00:13:03,781 --> 00:13:06,630
do want more accountability
and transparency,

218
00:13:06,870 --> 00:13:11,250
but the systems they are working with
are so dysfunctional and so broken and so

219
00:13:11,251 --> 00:13:16,251
corrupt that it's extremely difficult
to impose those solutions from on high.

220
00:13:17,130 --> 00:13:21,540
Those are the cases where blockchain
could be pretty transformational. Uh,

221
00:13:21,541 --> 00:13:25,680
and in some instances I think you're
going to get rigorous pushback from those

222
00:13:25,681 --> 00:13:27,190
in the bureaucracy,
uh,

223
00:13:27,270 --> 00:13:31,140
that are benefiting from the status quo
because once they recognize that it will

224
00:13:31,141 --> 00:13:34,440
make it much more challenging
to engage in corruption,

225
00:13:34,441 --> 00:13:37,260
they may be a little bit concerned.
But in other cases,

226
00:13:37,261 --> 00:13:40,030
what we're finding is that this is,
uh,

227
00:13:40,080 --> 00:13:45,080
a sufficiently large transformation that
even people on the wrong side of the

228
00:13:46,231 --> 00:13:51,231
equation right now understand they're
better off supporting this and working to

229
00:13:52,381 --> 00:13:53,940
build new,

230
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:58,740
more accountable and more transparent
business models and lives for themselves

231
00:13:58,741 --> 00:14:01,950
on the other side. Uh, then
they are fighting this outright.

232
00:14:02,290 --> 00:14:06,390
So I've actually been surprised and
impressed by the extent to which there

233
00:14:06,391 --> 00:14:10,800
hasn't been more pushback at this
stage of the technology's adoption.

234
00:14:11,240 --> 00:14:12,130
Yeah.
So Kyle,

235
00:14:12,340 --> 00:14:16,170
these governments that are adopting or
government institutions that they're

236
00:14:16,190 --> 00:14:17,210
adopting blockchain,

237
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:22,190
they typically create their own blog
chains or do they use existing ones?

238
00:14:22,380 --> 00:14:27,120
Uh, yes is the answer. And that's
another exciting dimension of this.

239
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:29,730
When blockchain technology first emerged,

240
00:14:29,731 --> 00:14:32,160
people thought there were only
two flavors of blockchain,

241
00:14:32,550 --> 00:14:36,360
public blockchains like Bitcoin,
blockchain or the ethereum blockchain,

242
00:14:36,540 --> 00:14:40,710
which run on computers all over the
world and anyone can set up a note and be

243
00:14:40,711 --> 00:14:45,510
part of those networks or private
blockchains that are defined.

244
00:14:45,511 --> 00:14:47,460
They exist within kind of a walled garden.

245
00:14:47,670 --> 00:14:51,920
You can only set up a node on that
network if you're invited and have the

246
00:14:51,921 --> 00:14:53,060
appropriate credentials.

247
00:14:53,480 --> 00:14:57,590
What we're finding now is that some of
the most powerful functionality comes

248
00:14:57,770 --> 00:14:59,930
when we actually layer blockchains.

249
00:14:59,960 --> 00:15:04,550
And when you use public blockchains and
private blockchains in coordination,

250
00:15:04,900 --> 00:15:08,450
uh, I'll give you an example of how
this is working. In the case of Georgia,

251
00:15:08,840 --> 00:15:11,360
the Bitcoin blockchain does
a lot of things really well,

252
00:15:11,390 --> 00:15:16,280
but it is not ideally suited to
processing big chunks of data.

253
00:15:16,610 --> 00:15:20,330
So if you have a complicated
map of a property, some place,

254
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:23,780
it's going to be really tough to
store that in the Bitcoin blockchain.

255
00:15:24,260 --> 00:15:27,800
So in this case, our technical
partner, the bit fury group,

256
00:15:28,010 --> 00:15:30,050
developed a solution called Exxon him,

257
00:15:30,530 --> 00:15:35,420
which takes a snapshot of the
registry, uh, every few minutes.

258
00:15:35,630 --> 00:15:40,210
And Hash is that blockchain or
stores that a static snapshot, uh,

259
00:15:40,250 --> 00:15:41,810
in a public blockchain.

260
00:15:41,870 --> 00:15:45,980
So what it allows you to do is
design a solution that's bespoke.

261
00:15:45,981 --> 00:15:49,730
You can get very high,
uh, transaction rates.

262
00:15:49,910 --> 00:15:53,250
You can get really big data
blocks as part of this system. Uh,

263
00:15:53,270 --> 00:15:56,130
you can do it exactly the
way you need to do it, uh,

264
00:15:56,180 --> 00:16:01,180
but then you have the data integrity
and the security that comes with logging

265
00:16:01,731 --> 00:16:05,360
that data are hashing that
data to a public blockchain.

266
00:16:05,770 --> 00:16:10,520
And I think that's where a lot of the
public sector applications will eventually

267
00:16:10,521 --> 00:16:13,120
end up, uh, is using this
layered approach, uh,

268
00:16:13,200 --> 00:16:16,530
that anchors information
to a public blockchain, uh,

269
00:16:16,550 --> 00:16:19,730
but actually stores the information
in a private blockchain,

270
00:16:21,940 --> 00:16:23,950
uh, in, uh,

271
00:16:23,951 --> 00:16:28,420
among current politicians
and government officials, uh,

272
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:33,220
especially in the US. What's their
current perception of blockchain?

273
00:16:33,620 --> 00:16:35,690
No, that's a, it's an excellent question.

274
00:16:35,840 --> 00:16:40,840
I have a good friend who spent a long
time working at the White House and after

275
00:16:41,961 --> 00:16:44,790
she left the White House,
somebody came to her,

276
00:16:44,950 --> 00:16:49,310
a former colleague who had gone on
to MIT, came to her and said, hey,

277
00:16:49,311 --> 00:16:53,190
I really think you should get
involved in blockchain technology. Uh,

278
00:16:53,200 --> 00:16:57,290
and her response was, uh, that's
criminal money and you're crazy.

279
00:16:57,710 --> 00:17:00,440
And, uh, I think if you
had to be honest about it,

280
00:17:00,441 --> 00:17:03,820
that is the perception of a lot of
folks in government right now. They,

281
00:17:03,821 --> 00:17:08,630
they view a blockchain and bitcoin
and everything associated with it,

282
00:17:08,830 --> 00:17:12,410
uh, as something that they probably
don't want to dabble with. Uh, and,

283
00:17:12,420 --> 00:17:15,560
and this mutual friend of
ours said, well, you'll wrong.

284
00:17:15,620 --> 00:17:19,310
Take some time to learn about it
and come back to me once you have a,

285
00:17:19,311 --> 00:17:19,731
and you know,

286
00:17:19,731 --> 00:17:23,450
she reached the conclusion that this had
the potential to be a transformational

287
00:17:23,451 --> 00:17:25,370
tool for supporting good governance.

288
00:17:25,370 --> 00:17:28,880
And I went through that same
process of realization. Uh,

289
00:17:28,970 --> 00:17:33,770
and I think what we are are focused on
right now and a lot of our educational

290
00:17:33,771 --> 00:17:34,251
efforts,

291
00:17:34,251 --> 00:17:37,790
both with the global blockchain business
council and with the blockchain trust

292
00:17:37,791 --> 00:17:38,624
accelerator,

293
00:17:38,980 --> 00:17:43,980
is working with policy makers to help
them understand how they can use this tool

294
00:17:44,331 --> 00:17:46,940
to solve public problems.
Uh, and you know,

295
00:17:46,941 --> 00:17:50,130
what we've seen is a pretty
dramatic transformation.

296
00:17:50,170 --> 00:17:54,300
I'll give you just one additional
anecdote in that department. Uh,

297
00:17:54,301 --> 00:17:56,160
almost exactly a year ago,

298
00:17:56,370 --> 00:18:00,320
may have been a year ago this week
I went into meet with the, uh,

299
00:18:00,440 --> 00:18:02,910
president's staff at
the World Bank and said,

300
00:18:02,911 --> 00:18:04,950
this is something that's really important,
uh,

301
00:18:05,020 --> 00:18:08,880
this has the potential to dramatically
change the way you do business.

302
00:18:09,180 --> 00:18:12,900
And I think you should spend some time
and energy understanding how this works.

303
00:18:13,430 --> 00:18:18,210
And they looked at me and smiled and
said, you're adorable. That's really nice.

304
00:18:18,410 --> 00:18:20,730
Uh,
we don't do early stage technology.

305
00:18:20,731 --> 00:18:23,550
Come back and see us in five years
and we'll have a conversation.

306
00:18:24,150 --> 00:18:26,490
And a about six months after that,

307
00:18:26,550 --> 00:18:31,350
they gave me a call and asked me to
keynote the launch of the World Bank's new

308
00:18:31,351 --> 00:18:36,140
blockchain lab. Uh, and in October
we cohosted with the World Bank, uh,

309
00:18:36,150 --> 00:18:38,440
the first ever blockchain summit,
uh,

310
00:18:38,500 --> 00:18:42,000
that they convened on the margins
of the World Bank's annual meetings.

311
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:46,950
So we are seeing that narrative play
out in institution after institution and

312
00:18:46,951 --> 00:18:48,750
organization after organization.

313
00:18:49,080 --> 00:18:54,080
And I think there's immense potential as
we try to help policy makers and others

314
00:18:55,771 --> 00:18:59,370
with the capacity to deploy
these solutions at scale,

315
00:18:59,580 --> 00:19:03,720
understand what can be done, uh, if
this technology is harnessed correctly.

316
00:19:04,190 --> 00:19:08,350
So you mentioned the global luxury in
business council and the luxury infest

317
00:19:08,360 --> 00:19:10,190
accelerator,
um,

318
00:19:10,550 --> 00:19:15,410
in addition to promoting
blockchain, uh, in, uh,

319
00:19:15,411 --> 00:19:17,170
among politicians,
uh,

320
00:19:17,250 --> 00:19:22,250
what specifically these organizations
also do and are they related?

321
00:19:23,060 --> 00:19:24,260
What's the connection between them?

322
00:19:24,590 --> 00:19:25,640
Great question.
Um,

323
00:19:25,641 --> 00:19:30,620
so these organizations both started out
of as series of conversations that we

324
00:19:30,621 --> 00:19:34,160
had during a very difficult,
challenging business trip.

325
00:19:34,200 --> 00:19:39,200
I took to Richard Branson's island in
the Caribbean and he hosts an annual

326
00:19:39,711 --> 00:19:43,490
blockchain summit. And a while we
were there, we surveyed the landscape.

327
00:19:43,491 --> 00:19:45,260
This was now about a year and a half ago,

328
00:19:45,680 --> 00:19:49,610
and saw that there was an enormous
amount of investment and activity around

329
00:19:49,611 --> 00:19:52,910
Fintech or financial technology
applications for blockchain,

330
00:19:53,300 --> 00:19:58,300
far less was taking place in the
governance and social impact space.

331
00:19:59,030 --> 00:20:00,530
And we wanted to solve that problem.

332
00:20:00,860 --> 00:20:05,330
So we set up a partnership called the
blockchain trust accelerator that brings

333
00:20:05,331 --> 00:20:08,300
together a number of different
communities and a number of different

334
00:20:08,301 --> 00:20:11,900
organizations. Uh, first the, the
place that I worked at New America,

335
00:20:11,901 --> 00:20:14,520
we are a civic incubator and think tank.
Uh,

336
00:20:14,530 --> 00:20:18,210
our board is people like Eric Schmidt
who chaired our board for many years and

337
00:20:18,211 --> 00:20:21,590
then David Brooks of the New
York Times. Uh, then we, uh,

338
00:20:21,620 --> 00:20:25,510
pulled in one of the world's
largest blockchain companies,
the big fury group. Uh,

339
00:20:25,580 --> 00:20:29,360
then we invited organizations that
work on solving public challenges.

340
00:20:29,490 --> 00:20:31,040
The National Democratic Institute,

341
00:20:31,041 --> 00:20:34,640
which is chaired by Madeline Albright
and the Rockefeller Foundation has since

342
00:20:34,641 --> 00:20:35,474
joined us.

343
00:20:35,630 --> 00:20:40,630
And together we work to identify
pilot projects in the social impact in

344
00:20:41,541 --> 00:20:45,950
governance space that can benefit from
the application of blockchain technology.

345
00:20:46,160 --> 00:20:50,200
And then we educate, build communities
around those solutions. So,

346
00:20:50,201 --> 00:20:53,110
in addition to the Georgia
project that I mentioned earlier,

347
00:20:53,320 --> 00:20:55,090
we've also worked to take,
uh,

348
00:20:55,120 --> 00:20:58,420
the world's largest registry
of civil society organizations,

349
00:20:58,421 --> 00:21:01,840
900,000 organizations
from around the world. Uh,

350
00:21:01,841 --> 00:21:04,750
and move that registry,
uh, onto blockchain.

351
00:21:05,170 --> 00:21:09,190
We've worked with partners in the UK who
are doing polling and public engagement,

352
00:21:09,490 --> 00:21:11,630
uh, in, in the UK parliament, uh,

353
00:21:11,650 --> 00:21:14,200
to help them build pilot
projects around blockchain.

354
00:21:14,380 --> 00:21:15,700
And we have many more in the pipeline.

355
00:21:15,910 --> 00:21:17,830
So that's the blockchain
trust accelerator.

356
00:21:18,010 --> 00:21:19,840
We're always looking
for partners and talent.

357
00:21:19,870 --> 00:21:23,320
Come talk to me afterwards or send me
a note if you'd like to work with us.

358
00:21:23,680 --> 00:21:27,580
The global blockchain business council
emerged out of the World Economic Forum

359
00:21:27,581 --> 00:21:32,581
meeting in Davos and it is a group of
leaders from about 40 countries who saw a

360
00:21:33,671 --> 00:21:38,671
real need to shape the deployment of
this technology on a global Blake basis.

361
00:21:39,380 --> 00:21:44,120
Uh, we bring together public sector
actors, policy, uh, thinkers,

362
00:21:44,420 --> 00:21:44,730
uh,

363
00:21:44,730 --> 00:21:49,720
and also a lot of very important partners
in the private sector to look at how

364
00:21:49,721 --> 00:21:52,630
you can, uh, provide people
with the information they need,

365
00:21:52,631 --> 00:21:56,320
especially c suite level leaders to
make good decisions around their use of

366
00:21:56,321 --> 00:21:59,510
blockchain technology. How you
can build partnerships, uh,

367
00:21:59,530 --> 00:22:02,320
that will harness this
technology successfully. Uh,

368
00:22:02,420 --> 00:22:07,060
and how we can shape a
regulatory environment that's
going to be conducive to

369
00:22:07,120 --> 00:22:11,800
hopefully capturing some of the value
that can't exist if we do this. Right.

370
00:22:12,160 --> 00:22:16,730
Uh, so you mentioned, um,
uh, regulations, uh, what,

371
00:22:16,740 --> 00:22:21,740
what current regulations and regulatory
frameworks already exist and what's

372
00:22:22,101 --> 00:22:23,330
about to emerge?

373
00:22:23,680 --> 00:22:27,340
That's a very important
and challenging question.

374
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:31,330
We're seeing two big approaches
in the United States.

375
00:22:31,390 --> 00:22:36,390
Regulators had a adopted an attitude
that they're not going to regulate the

376
00:22:36,671 --> 00:22:38,200
underlying technology.

377
00:22:38,290 --> 00:22:42,460
What they are going to do is regulate
activity that occurs on the platform.

378
00:22:42,730 --> 00:22:47,620
And they're going to do that largely
using existing tools. So if you are,

379
00:22:47,650 --> 00:22:51,760
uh, for example, uh, issuing
securities using blockchain,

380
00:22:51,790 --> 00:22:54,760
which is a thing, as some
of you may have heard, uh,

381
00:22:54,800 --> 00:22:59,310
there has been a phenomenon called the
initial coin offering, which is a, a,

382
00:22:59,350 --> 00:23:04,120
a mechanism for tokenizing, uh,
in some cases value in companies,

383
00:23:04,121 --> 00:23:06,820
in some cases, other things, uh, and, uh,

384
00:23:06,821 --> 00:23:09,880
raising funds on the basis
of those offerings. Uh,

385
00:23:09,910 --> 00:23:13,870
then the sec is going to take a good hard
look at what you're doing and if they

386
00:23:13,871 --> 00:23:18,070
determine that what you are doing a,
it looks like an initial public offering,

387
00:23:18,100 --> 00:23:21,580
then they're probably going to come down
on you pretty hard and regulate you the

388
00:23:21,581 --> 00:23:25,540
way they would, uh, an initial
public offering. In other instances,

389
00:23:25,541 --> 00:23:29,980
we see countries that are looking at
the technology itself. Uh, and here,

390
00:23:29,981 --> 00:23:31,690
China's an intriguing example.

391
00:23:31,750 --> 00:23:36,490
There's been a great deal of interest
and enthusiasm on the part of Chinese

392
00:23:36,491 --> 00:23:40,100
officials, uh, in the use of
blockchain technology. Uh,

393
00:23:40,220 --> 00:23:45,220
I was in China earlier this year and
we were accepted or received by a,

394
00:23:45,540 --> 00:23:47,900
I think,
seven government ministers,

395
00:23:47,901 --> 00:23:51,090
a provincial governors and justice
of their supreme court. Uh,

396
00:23:51,091 --> 00:23:53,030
and about 1500 corporate leaders.

397
00:23:53,031 --> 00:23:57,470
So this is a technology that has
a very broad audience in China,

398
00:23:57,860 --> 00:24:01,130
but there had been some concerns on the
part of Chinese authorities about the

399
00:24:01,131 --> 00:24:06,131
underlying technology in part because
it does exist outside the realm of

400
00:24:06,531 --> 00:24:10,730
government influence. It's not something
that governments can turn on or off.

401
00:24:11,090 --> 00:24:13,670
If you think about this
in a European context,

402
00:24:13,850 --> 00:24:17,840
the Europeans have a law that I'm sure
many of you have dealt with a that deals

403
00:24:17,841 --> 00:24:21,110
with the right to be forgotten or
so called right to be forgotten.

404
00:24:21,470 --> 00:24:23,390
You can't forget anything in blockchain.

405
00:24:23,610 --> 00:24:27,980
It's technically impossible
to forget information in
blockchain. So there's some,

406
00:24:28,040 --> 00:24:32,720
there's some new challenges that will
emerge at a regulatory level as we bring

407
00:24:32,721 --> 00:24:34,930
blockchain solutions to scale.
Now

408
00:24:35,850 --> 00:24:40,850
sending issue with blockchain is our
long transection processing times,

409
00:24:41,840 --> 00:24:45,300
which I've sort of slowing
the amount of adoption.

410
00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:47,700
There are a few proposed
solutions to this,

411
00:24:47,970 --> 00:24:51,310
but nothing that's really gone mainstream.
Um,

412
00:24:51,420 --> 00:24:55,090
are there any solutions that you're aware
of that are likely to, they come in?

413
00:24:55,890 --> 00:24:58,950
So that's a great question.
Uh, as you point out,

414
00:24:59,040 --> 00:25:04,040
technically there some pretty compelling
fixes that have been developed that

415
00:25:04,260 --> 00:25:07,470
solved the problem of, of
long transaction types. Uh,

416
00:25:07,471 --> 00:25:11,700
a former Googler took a lot of
those fixes and package them into a

417
00:25:11,701 --> 00:25:13,950
cryptocurrency called light coin,
uh,

418
00:25:13,951 --> 00:25:18,660
that has had a rather meteoric rise
in the last couple of weeks as well.

419
00:25:18,930 --> 00:25:23,310
So we know that technically you can build
blockchains that will solve for these

420
00:25:23,311 --> 00:25:28,170
challenges that have very high transaction
rates, uh, that, uh, facilitate, uh,

421
00:25:28,171 --> 00:25:29,850
again,
as I indicated earlier,

422
00:25:30,180 --> 00:25:35,180
larger blocks of data as part of each new
link in the chain that constitutes the

423
00:25:36,151 --> 00:25:36,984
blockchain.

424
00:25:37,110 --> 00:25:42,110
What we don't know yet is whether it
will be possible to push all of those

425
00:25:42,871 --> 00:25:46,920
solutions or some of those solutions,
uh, into the Bitcoin blockchain,

426
00:25:47,220 --> 00:25:50,670
which is at the moment experiencing
a fair amount of congestion, uh,

427
00:25:50,710 --> 00:25:52,640
in the context of, uh, uh,

428
00:25:52,770 --> 00:25:56,760
pretty extraordinary
increase in the valuation.

429
00:25:56,760 --> 00:25:59,480
A big bitcoin over the
last couple of weeks. Uh,

430
00:25:59,490 --> 00:26:02,520
and so I think there is
an open question there.

431
00:26:02,550 --> 00:26:05,420
Bitcoin may turn out to be,
uh,

432
00:26:05,610 --> 00:26:10,530
something that is used primarily as a
store of value and for very high value

433
00:26:10,531 --> 00:26:14,640
transactions. And in that case it
probably won't matter too much. Um,

434
00:26:14,780 --> 00:26:16,800
or if you want to make it mainstream,

435
00:26:16,830 --> 00:26:20,520
you will have to adopt some of
these new solutions, uh, in,

436
00:26:20,521 --> 00:26:23,780
in conjunction with the existing rails.
Uh,

437
00:26:23,781 --> 00:26:28,020
and that is more of a political challenge,

438
00:26:28,021 --> 00:26:31,620
a among the various data centers that,
uh,

439
00:26:31,710 --> 00:26:34,330
operate the bitcoin
network, uh, because the,

440
00:26:34,331 --> 00:26:39,240
the bitcoin network is maintained by a
decentralized group of entities that are

441
00:26:39,241 --> 00:26:40,800
often referred to as minors,

442
00:26:40,801 --> 00:26:44,000
although I think that's a really
weird and lousy name. Um, but the,

443
00:26:44,001 --> 00:26:47,400
the entities that operate these data
centers ultimately have to come to

444
00:26:47,401 --> 00:26:51,510
agreement on which of the solutions
they're willing to bring into the network.

445
00:26:51,510 --> 00:26:56,340
And that will determine, uh,
I would suggest the likely,

446
00:26:56,430 --> 00:26:58,130
uh, transaction, uh,

447
00:26:58,440 --> 00:27:02,040
throughput that will be possible
in the network going forward.

448
00:27:02,370 --> 00:27:05,460
It's also important to recognize
just one more point on this,

449
00:27:05,910 --> 00:27:10,680
that if you had tried to run
youtube on the Internet in 1993,

450
00:27:10,950 --> 00:27:12,120
it wouldn't have worked that well.

451
00:27:12,350 --> 00:27:15,930
We would have had some serious
challenges in doing that. And again,

452
00:27:16,020 --> 00:27:20,670
we're in 1993. Um, so there
will be, I'm pretty confident,

453
00:27:20,970 --> 00:27:21,420
uh,

454
00:27:21,420 --> 00:27:26,010
more and better solutions developed
for these challenges as the technology

455
00:27:26,011 --> 00:27:26,844
matures.

456
00:27:26,880 --> 00:27:29,970
Hopefully some of you in this room or
watching will be able to come up with

457
00:27:29,971 --> 00:27:30,804
those fixes.

458
00:27:31,550 --> 00:27:36,440
What about some of the other pitfalls
of, of blockchain? For example,

459
00:27:36,470 --> 00:27:40,550
the relatively high power consumption,
a volatility,

460
00:27:40,580 --> 00:27:45,280
forks and plates, risks
of mining, pool takeovers,

461
00:27:45,860 --> 00:27:49,430
a et cetera.
Do you see any of these as a concern?

462
00:27:49,910 --> 00:27:54,080
These are all the easy questions and you
just lumped them all together there. Um,

463
00:27:54,081 --> 00:27:57,920
so let's, let's try to go through
those, uh, in, in some sequencing.

464
00:27:58,190 --> 00:28:02,510
First power consumption. Right now, the
network does use a lot of power. Uh,

465
00:28:02,511 --> 00:28:05,660
ironically that's one of the
things that makes it so secure.

466
00:28:05,930 --> 00:28:07,400
If you wanted to hack that,

467
00:28:07,430 --> 00:28:11,990
we only know really one way to
hack the bitcoin network, uh,

468
00:28:12,090 --> 00:28:17,090
and that is to amass a computational
power that is equivalent to more than 51%

469
00:28:19,210 --> 00:28:22,160
of all the computational
power in the network.

470
00:28:22,760 --> 00:28:24,860
In order to do that right now,

471
00:28:24,930 --> 00:28:29,930
it would take about as much
electricity as a medium sized country,

472
00:28:30,070 --> 00:28:34,970
uh, uses to operate. So this is not an
easy thing to pull off. And again, I,

473
00:28:34,971 --> 00:28:38,750
ironically, it's one of the reasons
that the network is so secure.

474
00:28:39,470 --> 00:28:44,240
A lot of the responsible companies in
this space are using renewable energy, uh,

475
00:28:44,241 --> 00:28:47,390
and they are running the
network off of clean hydro.

476
00:28:47,390 --> 00:28:51,770
They're running the network off of
geothermal energy. But there are, uh,

477
00:28:51,920 --> 00:28:52,753
some,

478
00:28:53,210 --> 00:28:57,710
some important reasons to think about
what happens is this technology becomes

479
00:28:57,711 --> 00:28:59,120
more ubiquitous.

480
00:28:59,510 --> 00:29:03,980
I would view the electricity consumption
of the network at the moment,

481
00:29:04,190 --> 00:29:07,280
less as a bug and more as a bounty,

482
00:29:07,281 --> 00:29:12,281
a $200,000 bounty that's issued every
10 minutes on finding a efficient,

483
00:29:12,980 --> 00:29:16,490
clean energy around the
world. Uh, and ironically,

484
00:29:16,640 --> 00:29:21,580
the spreading popularity of
blockchain may be one of the, uh,

485
00:29:21,620 --> 00:29:26,510
forcing mechanisms for encouraging
greater adoption of cheap,

486
00:29:26,511 --> 00:29:29,720
clean energy. If we do it right,
there are questions there.

487
00:29:29,721 --> 00:29:31,220
It's not a foregone conclusion,

488
00:29:31,720 --> 00:29:35,480
but that's certainly one
direction that this could go. Um,

489
00:29:35,481 --> 00:29:39,870
some of the other challenges that
you mentioned, uh, the, uh, issue of,

490
00:29:39,871 --> 00:29:43,180
of what happens if there
are in the network, um,

491
00:29:43,360 --> 00:29:48,360
that is a problem that I suggest will
be solved eventually with the maturation

492
00:29:48,730 --> 00:29:49,780
of the technology.

493
00:29:50,080 --> 00:29:55,080
Right now what can happen and has
happened on rare occasion is that if,

494
00:29:55,810 --> 00:30:00,800
uh, someone who is part of the network
decides that they don't want to, uh,

495
00:30:00,880 --> 00:30:03,490
run the dominant protocol anymore,

496
00:30:03,730 --> 00:30:08,550
they can go off on their own and create
what's called a fork in the chain and,

497
00:30:08,551 --> 00:30:13,270
and develop their own a new chain as
part of the bitcoin network where as part

498
00:30:13,271 --> 00:30:14,980
of anyone else's network,
uh,

499
00:30:15,010 --> 00:30:18,790
that doesn't wipe out the assets
that you have stored on the network.

500
00:30:18,791 --> 00:30:22,770
Those assets, uh, continued
to exist on both networks. Uh,

501
00:30:22,780 --> 00:30:25,900
but it does create a problem if
you're trying to keep track of things.

502
00:30:26,290 --> 00:30:28,930
As the technology becomes more ubiquitous,

503
00:30:28,960 --> 00:30:31,840
as the size of the network increases,

504
00:30:32,140 --> 00:30:37,140
it will be harder and harder for any
actor to create a dominant alternative,

505
00:30:38,630 --> 00:30:43,030
uh, to the main chain. Uh, and I
think that is, uh, you know, again,

506
00:30:43,031 --> 00:30:45,890
something that we're
already seeing, uh, as,

507
00:30:45,910 --> 00:30:50,910
as the technology moves forward and
as the valuation a Bitcoin increases,

508
00:30:51,720 --> 00:30:54,220
uh, but it's something that we'll
want to keep an eye on going forward.

509
00:30:54,670 --> 00:30:57,820
So it is a very volatile acid right now.
Uh,

510
00:30:57,910 --> 00:31:01,270
certainly there are a lot of people
making a great deal of money off of that

511
00:31:01,271 --> 00:31:06,070
volatility. So a, again, for some folks,
this is a feature rather than a bug. Uh,

512
00:31:06,071 --> 00:31:10,120
we're seeing a couple of developments
that should help tamp down volatility in

513
00:31:10,121 --> 00:31:14,560
time. The first is, uh, as
many of you likely heard today,

514
00:31:14,590 --> 00:31:19,330
we saw the launch a bitcoin futures.
Historically futures have,

515
00:31:19,360 --> 00:31:24,100
uh, a moderating effect on
prices and volatile assets.

516
00:31:24,340 --> 00:31:27,250
So to the extent you're able
to create futures contracts,

517
00:31:27,251 --> 00:31:31,960
that should limit the extent of, of
the volatility within the asset. Uh,

518
00:31:31,990 --> 00:31:36,870
the second thing that I anticipate
will have an impact on volatility, uh,

519
00:31:36,910 --> 00:31:39,670
is the spreading adoption
of the technology.

520
00:31:39,671 --> 00:31:42,410
The more people that are
using it going forward, uh,

521
00:31:42,530 --> 00:31:47,500
the less likely you are to have wild,
wild swings in the valuation of the asset.

522
00:31:47,980 --> 00:31:48,091
Oh,

523
00:31:48,091 --> 00:31:53,091
you've only talked about some of the
opportunities far building infrastructure

524
00:31:53,541 --> 00:31:57,960
and apps. Do you have
anything else in mind? Uh,

525
00:31:58,040 --> 00:32:00,440
that might be a particularly great idea.

526
00:32:00,550 --> 00:32:05,550
So I can tell you some of the amazing
solutions that we're seeing come our way,

527
00:32:05,750 --> 00:32:09,070
uh, at the blockchain trust accelerator
and in the global blockchain business

528
00:32:09,071 --> 00:32:09,881
council and,

529
00:32:09,881 --> 00:32:14,230
and some of these are just immensely
exciting at a number of different levels.

530
00:32:14,540 --> 00:32:18,730
Uh, we were approached by
one firm recently that's
developed a blockchain based

531
00:32:18,731 --> 00:32:23,731
mechanism for doing distributed power
generation in off-grid villages and

532
00:32:25,090 --> 00:32:28,960
developing countries.
Why is blockchain relevant here?

533
00:32:29,470 --> 00:32:30,340
How does this work?

534
00:32:30,760 --> 00:32:35,760
You can now buy for about a hundred bucks
integrated systems that will combine a

535
00:32:36,131 --> 00:32:40,860
solar panel, a battery, some light
bulbs, cell phone charger, and,

536
00:32:40,861 --> 00:32:44,570
and the other pieces that you need
for basic electrical system, uh,

537
00:32:44,571 --> 00:32:48,620
in a little hot in a rural
village someplace. Um, so that's,

538
00:32:48,650 --> 00:32:53,180
that's pretty cool that we can do that.
The problem is that in these villages,

539
00:32:53,210 --> 00:32:57,200
very few people have a hundred bucks that
they can throw at one of these systems.

540
00:32:57,500 --> 00:32:58,550
And up until now,

541
00:32:58,551 --> 00:33:02,990
there hasn't been any good mechanism
for financing the deployment of these

542
00:33:02,991 --> 00:33:05,360
technologies,
these technologies at scale.

543
00:33:05,840 --> 00:33:10,150
So what we're able to do with
blockchain now, uh, is create a fixed,

544
00:33:10,151 --> 00:33:13,310
whereby you pay four,

545
00:33:13,400 --> 00:33:18,400
$5 of electricity and you put that money
into a blockchain system and agent puts

546
00:33:19,401 --> 00:33:21,050
that money into a blockchain system.

547
00:33:21,290 --> 00:33:25,470
And then you get a text message and
then you put that text message, uh,

548
00:33:25,530 --> 00:33:28,820
into the electrical system that's
been installed in your house.

549
00:33:29,030 --> 00:33:32,120
And you get two months of
electricity, uh, for that $5,

550
00:33:32,121 --> 00:33:34,370
which is a lot less than
you would spend on kerosene.

551
00:33:34,550 --> 00:33:36,980
And it's a lot less than
you would spend on, on wood.

552
00:33:37,070 --> 00:33:38,780
So really good solution for everyone.

553
00:33:39,230 --> 00:33:42,950
And then in two months when the agent
comes back, you give him another $5,

554
00:33:43,250 --> 00:33:46,010
they put that into the blockchain,
they send you another code,

555
00:33:46,190 --> 00:33:47,930
you get another two months of electricity,

556
00:33:48,200 --> 00:33:50,300
and eventually you're able
to pay off that system.

557
00:33:50,800 --> 00:33:55,800
So that's one kind of micro example of
how we're seeing blockchain a deployed,

558
00:33:56,480 --> 00:34:00,970
another really cool example, a
company called box Gov, which has, uh,

559
00:34:00,980 --> 00:34:04,410
for those of you who do ventures,
some of the coolest unfunded tech, uh,

560
00:34:04,470 --> 00:34:05,750
that I have yet encountered.

561
00:34:06,170 --> 00:34:11,170
They figured out a way to scrape the
80% of all information produced by

562
00:34:11,571 --> 00:34:16,571
governments that isn't available via a
Google search or any other search and

563
00:34:16,761 --> 00:34:20,630
curate that and make it beautifully
visualize a bowl and you can sort it and

564
00:34:20,631 --> 00:34:22,910
slice it and dice it a
thousand different ways.

565
00:34:23,660 --> 00:34:27,980
They then are going to put that
information on a blockchain, a framework.

566
00:34:28,130 --> 00:34:31,460
One of the issues that governments
all over the world experience and our

567
00:34:31,461 --> 00:34:33,590
government unfortunately
is not immune to this,

568
00:34:34,180 --> 00:34:38,090
is that when new folks come in and they
don't like information that is stored by

569
00:34:38,091 --> 00:34:39,840
the government, they get rid of it. Uh,

570
00:34:39,950 --> 00:34:44,300
we saw this earlier this year with
climate data that was stored by the

571
00:34:44,301 --> 00:34:47,330
environmental protection
agency in the United States.

572
00:34:47,570 --> 00:34:50,540
And there was an effort
to wipe out and on a race,

573
00:34:50,660 --> 00:34:54,350
some very important climate data, uh,
that had been gathered by the EPA.

574
00:34:55,040 --> 00:34:59,990
This is a solution for that and it,
it will enable you to have a very secure,

575
00:35:00,290 --> 00:35:05,210
auditable record, uh, of,
uh, all information that's
produced by a government,

576
00:35:05,450 --> 00:35:08,180
uh, and you know, again,
search it, visualize it,

577
00:35:08,181 --> 00:35:09,560
do a lot of other cool things with it.

578
00:35:10,160 --> 00:35:14,660
The last thing that I'll mention
involves the deployment of grants and

579
00:35:15,140 --> 00:35:20,140
government funding or other public
resources went now the u s government,

580
00:35:21,200 --> 00:35:26,200
every year issues $144
billion in improper payments,

581
00:35:27,980 --> 00:35:31,580
$144 billion in improper payments.

582
00:35:31,880 --> 00:35:36,560
That's money that goes out the door
because people haven't validated, uh, the,

583
00:35:36,840 --> 00:35:39,300
uh,
the recipients on the other end,

584
00:35:39,710 --> 00:35:43,320
they haven't checked to ensure
that the recipients are alive.

585
00:35:43,320 --> 00:35:47,580
There are whole host of problems that
come into play and around the world right

586
00:35:47,581 --> 00:35:52,070
now, corruption is about a three
point $6 trillion problem. Uh,

587
00:35:52,110 --> 00:35:55,740
if you listen to the United
Nations that just, uh,

588
00:35:55,760 --> 00:35:59,520
to translate it is about 5% of global GDP,

589
00:35:59,610 --> 00:36:02,970
which even by Google
standards is a big number a,

590
00:36:02,971 --> 00:36:07,500
and what you have the potential to do
with blockchain is create a system where

591
00:36:07,501 --> 00:36:11,250
as money goes out the door, it's
tracked, you know, where it's going,

592
00:36:11,251 --> 00:36:14,490
you can follow it.
It's visible to anyone on the network.

593
00:36:14,730 --> 00:36:19,350
And we're seeing a host of different
actors developing solutions right now that

594
00:36:19,351 --> 00:36:24,351
should enable unprecedented levels of
accountability and transparency in the way

595
00:36:24,901 --> 00:36:26,580
that public resources are spent.

596
00:36:26,940 --> 00:36:31,530
The biggest impact for this technology
could eventually come in emerging markets,

597
00:36:31,810 --> 00:36:32,040
uh,

598
00:36:32,040 --> 00:36:36,990
that may effectively skipped copper and
go straight to these next generation

599
00:36:36,991 --> 00:36:40,570
systems for deploying financing,
uh, around the world and,

600
00:36:40,571 --> 00:36:44,820
and deploying funds around the world. And
it could have a really profound impact,

601
00:36:44,821 --> 00:36:49,650
not only in terms of attacking that
three point $6 trillion problem, uh,

602
00:36:49,651 --> 00:36:51,600
of a official corruption,
uh,

603
00:36:51,601 --> 00:36:56,601
but also in pushing
resources and investment into
geographies where right now

604
00:36:57,420 --> 00:37:00,750
it's not flowing. Uh, and, and that's
an important thing for all of us.

605
00:37:01,060 --> 00:37:05,740
Current trust in politics is at
an all time low, I think it is.

606
00:37:05,890 --> 00:37:10,780
And uh, could chain how to
restore our trust in politics.

607
00:37:10,781 --> 00:37:13,970
And then in specifically the, the, the
issues that we're dealing with, uh,

608
00:37:14,100 --> 00:37:16,330
like people,
um,

609
00:37:16,360 --> 00:37:21,310
believing that their representatives
don't have their interest at heart.

610
00:37:21,940 --> 00:37:23,540
And in many cases they don't.

611
00:37:24,880 --> 00:37:29,880
And like things like people not telling
the truth or there being multiple

612
00:37:30,521 --> 00:37:33,910
versions of the truth. And, you
know, these are the big issues.

613
00:37:34,210 --> 00:37:38,170
Absolutely. Um, a really
crucial challenge.

614
00:37:38,200 --> 00:37:41,950
If you look at the data, uh, at
Davos this last year at Edelman,

615
00:37:41,951 --> 00:37:44,470
the public relations company
releases something, uh,

616
00:37:44,590 --> 00:37:49,420
each year for the last 17 years called
the trust barometer survey. And,

617
00:37:49,421 --> 00:37:50,950
uh,
they got up,

618
00:37:50,951 --> 00:37:54,460
Richard Edelman got up to release the
trust barometer this year and said,

619
00:37:54,550 --> 00:37:56,300
we've never seen anything like this.
You know,

620
00:37:56,350 --> 00:38:00,400
this is as bad as it's ever gotten
in every sector that we monitor,

621
00:38:00,580 --> 00:38:04,000
we see cratering trust. Uh, if
you look at the Gallup data,

622
00:38:04,001 --> 00:38:07,990
which goes back much further
to about 1973 there again,

623
00:38:08,020 --> 00:38:11,710
we are at all time lows. So
this is in, in many respects,

624
00:38:11,920 --> 00:38:15,730
the challenge of our time because again,
as we talked about earlier,

625
00:38:15,970 --> 00:38:20,410
the story of humanity is a story
of collaboration based on trust.

626
00:38:20,680 --> 00:38:24,250
And if that trust leaves, if you don't
have access to that trust anymore,

627
00:38:24,460 --> 00:38:27,010
you're not going to be able to do all
the other cool things that we're able to

628
00:38:27,011 --> 00:38:29,110
do.
So this is really foundational.

629
00:38:29,830 --> 00:38:32,860
Blockchain could very
well be that solution. Uh,

630
00:38:32,900 --> 00:38:36,180
certainly my hope that it is
going to that solution. Uh,

631
00:38:36,340 --> 00:38:39,680
and we're trying to tackle this from
a couple of different dimensions. Uh,

632
00:38:39,830 --> 00:38:43,900
the first is if you look at the,
the problem of fake news,

633
00:38:43,901 --> 00:38:47,320
which it seems weird that something,
you know,

634
00:38:47,380 --> 00:38:51,080
two years ago and nobody knew
what it is, is now ubiquitous. Um,

635
00:38:51,160 --> 00:38:52,810
but this is a real issue.
Uh,

636
00:38:52,811 --> 00:38:57,811
and I was asked to come
have a conversation with the
leadership of a very large

637
00:38:58,151 --> 00:39:03,151
social media platform a little while ago
to discuss how blockchain could be used

638
00:39:04,091 --> 00:39:08,710
to create a supply chain for information
that flows through their systems.

639
00:39:09,050 --> 00:39:12,670
Uh, and an essence,
once you create a story,

640
00:39:12,671 --> 00:39:14,680
once you create some news,

641
00:39:14,980 --> 00:39:19,600
if you anchor that news in the
blockchain, uh, or in, in a blockchain,

642
00:39:19,630 --> 00:39:22,750
you can do a couple of things.
You can validate where it came from.

643
00:39:23,020 --> 00:39:25,840
You can validate when it
was originally posted,

644
00:39:25,841 --> 00:39:29,450
which turns out to be very
important in many instances a,

645
00:39:29,500 --> 00:39:34,450
and you can also point back to it so
that each time it's posted on a social

646
00:39:34,451 --> 00:39:39,160
media platform, you'll know
whether it comes from a reliable,

647
00:39:39,161 --> 00:39:43,420
trustworthy source that has issued a lot
of good stories in the past or whether

648
00:39:43,421 --> 00:39:47,830
it comes from the fly by night operation
that is notorious for pumping out bad

649
00:39:47,831 --> 00:39:49,840
data and bad information.
Uh,

650
00:39:49,910 --> 00:39:52,630
so I think it could be very
valuable in that context.

651
00:39:52,870 --> 00:39:55,450
We've also created at the
blockchain trust accelerator,

652
00:39:55,451 --> 00:39:59,440
a working group to look at how
blockchain can be used in voting.

653
00:40:00,010 --> 00:40:02,950
We have big problems around, uh, voting,

654
00:40:02,951 --> 00:40:06,310
not because our current
system doesn't work so much,

655
00:40:06,520 --> 00:40:11,190
but because people don't have confidence
in our current system. Uh, and in,

656
00:40:11,191 --> 00:40:15,880
in some instances we do have shortcomings.
If you talk about overseas military,

657
00:40:15,900 --> 00:40:17,260
uh,
in the United States,

658
00:40:17,560 --> 00:40:21,310
they have a horrific mechanism
for casting their ballots,

659
00:40:21,311 --> 00:40:25,800
which means that in many cases they're
giving up the anonymity of their vote, uh,

660
00:40:25,840 --> 00:40:30,640
and or their vote isn't counted at all
because it comes in too late to make the

661
00:40:30,641 --> 00:40:32,980
deadline for the election.
Uh,

662
00:40:32,981 --> 00:40:37,330
so we're working to figure out how we
might be able to deploy building solutions

663
00:40:37,331 --> 00:40:41,590
that will give them a chance to cast
their ballot in a trusted manner going

664
00:40:41,591 --> 00:40:42,424
forward.

665
00:40:42,490 --> 00:40:46,210
This combined with some of the
anticorruption functionality
that we talked about

666
00:40:46,211 --> 00:40:46,661
earlier,

667
00:40:46,661 --> 00:40:51,100
I hope is going to make it much easier
for citizens to have confidence in their

668
00:40:51,101 --> 00:40:51,934
institutions

669
00:40:52,330 --> 00:40:55,960
after every surgery of
price of cryptocurrencies.

670
00:40:56,050 --> 00:40:59,170
People begin to think it's a
bubble and it's all going to crash.

671
00:40:59,570 --> 00:41:02,220
A including right now,
um,

672
00:41:02,800 --> 00:41:07,390
can in European can value of
cryptocurrencies continued to rise?

673
00:41:07,420 --> 00:41:10,600
And is this still a good time to buy?

674
00:41:11,690 --> 00:41:14,530
It's an interesting question. Um, I,

675
00:41:14,540 --> 00:41:17,290
it's certainly can continue to rise,
uh,

676
00:41:17,370 --> 00:41:22,310
and it could continue to rise pretty
dramatically depending on the assumptions

677
00:41:22,311 --> 00:41:22,851
you use.

678
00:41:22,851 --> 00:41:27,310
It's easy to come up with scenarios in
which the value of a single bitcoin,

679
00:41:27,580 --> 00:41:31,130
uh,
is justifiable at $250,000.

680
00:41:31,340 --> 00:41:33,020
It's easy to come up with scenarios,

681
00:41:33,140 --> 00:41:37,610
which the value of a single bitcoin
is a justifiable at a valuation of $1

682
00:41:37,610 --> 00:41:38,443
million.
Um,

683
00:41:38,480 --> 00:41:42,050
it's also easy to come up with scenarios
in which the value is much less than

684
00:41:42,051 --> 00:41:46,700
that. And so this could go any
number of directions. Uh, you know,

685
00:41:46,701 --> 00:41:49,100
my, my advice would be, uh,

686
00:41:49,400 --> 00:41:54,400
I think multifold the first is don't
invest so much that you're going to lose

687
00:41:55,611 --> 00:41:58,760
sleep over it. Um, and you know,
that's, that's been what I've done.

688
00:41:58,761 --> 00:42:01,370
It's cost me some money because
had I gotten an earlier,

689
00:42:01,371 --> 00:42:03,110
I probably would've made more.
Uh,

690
00:42:03,111 --> 00:42:06,590
but I have plenty of friends who have a
substantial portion of their net worth

691
00:42:06,591 --> 00:42:09,890
tied up in cryptocurrency. And, uh, it is,

692
00:42:09,920 --> 00:42:13,070
it is a challenging thing to have a
substantial portion of your net worth tied

693
00:42:13,071 --> 00:42:17,300
up in cryptocurrency because of the
fluctuations in value. Uh, but again,

694
00:42:17,301 --> 00:42:22,301
if you look at this basket of assets
as a new analog for gold and as a new

695
00:42:23,301 --> 00:42:27,170
mechanism for conveying
value around the world,

696
00:42:27,590 --> 00:42:32,510
there's vast potential there. Uh,
and I think it's very likely that a,

697
00:42:32,600 --> 00:42:33,201
again,

698
00:42:33,201 --> 00:42:38,201
as we see a broader range of
organizations coming to the table,

699
00:42:38,301 --> 00:42:38,961
including,

700
00:42:38,961 --> 00:42:43,961
but especially institutional investors
that are looking for assets that are what

701
00:42:45,471 --> 00:42:48,980
we say, a, they're not
correlated to anything else. And,

702
00:42:48,981 --> 00:42:52,880
and cryptocurrencies as a whole
aren't correlated to anything else,

703
00:42:53,090 --> 00:42:57,740
which is a big advantage if you're
a big institutional investor.

704
00:42:58,030 --> 00:43:01,880
Uh, there's a lot of potential
upside there. Uh, so we'll,
we'll see how this goes.

705
00:43:02,120 --> 00:43:05,910
I think it's also important to invest
in those that are developing the,

706
00:43:05,911 --> 00:43:10,490
the picks and shovels, uh, rather
than, uh, just the gold itself. So I,

707
00:43:10,491 --> 00:43:14,120
I've tried to focus most of my
engagement now on companies rather than

708
00:43:14,121 --> 00:43:14,954
currencies.

709
00:43:16,280 --> 00:43:19,640
Thank you for the, uh, for
the informative answers.

710
00:43:19,700 --> 00:43:24,290
So you have been talking
about transparency all the
way. So what about privacy?

711
00:43:24,650 --> 00:43:29,030
Like, do I like to everyone in the world
to know how I spend my money on all my

712
00:43:29,031 --> 00:43:33,140
private, you know, life. Um, how do we
balance this in the blockchain world?

713
00:43:33,800 --> 00:43:35,930
It was a very important question.

714
00:43:35,960 --> 00:43:40,070
And blockchains are actually really
good at keeping private information,

715
00:43:40,100 --> 00:43:43,160
private and public information public.
Um,

716
00:43:43,220 --> 00:43:47,480
the bitcoin network is not anonymous, so
some people think it's pseudo anonymous,

717
00:43:48,020 --> 00:43:52,820
but you can structure blockchains in
ways that provide far higher levels of

718
00:43:52,821 --> 00:43:56,720
security than virtually any
solution that's available today. Uh,

719
00:43:56,721 --> 00:44:00,020
we're seeing some countries,
uh, latch on to this,

720
00:44:00,250 --> 00:44:05,250
arguably the most advanced he government
in the world is Astonia and Astonia is

721
00:44:05,511 --> 00:44:09,920
moving medical records on the blockchain
because they feel that it provides much

722
00:44:09,921 --> 00:44:14,620
higher levels of accountability
and security and privacy. Uh,

723
00:44:14,660 --> 00:44:18,290
then their existing solutions, and again,
their existing solutions are really,

724
00:44:18,291 --> 00:44:19,670
really good.
Um,

725
00:44:19,730 --> 00:44:23,300
because of the way that the network is
structured and the fact that all of the

726
00:44:23,301 --> 00:44:25,430
nodes are constantly checking each other,

727
00:44:26,060 --> 00:44:30,150
it's almost impossible to see information,
uh,

728
00:44:30,240 --> 00:44:34,830
on a blockchain that shouldn't be
seen. Uh, it would require, again,

729
00:44:35,040 --> 00:44:39,600
this massive investment of the
electricity in computational power. Uh,

730
00:44:39,650 --> 00:44:42,510
in order to crack, uh,
one of the blocks of data.

731
00:44:42,840 --> 00:44:46,040
So there's really great potential,
uh,

732
00:44:46,170 --> 00:44:49,650
for the use of blockchain as
a tool for promoting privacy.

733
00:44:49,980 --> 00:44:53,340
It's also important to recognize that
at least as it relates to financial

734
00:44:53,341 --> 00:44:56,220
transactions, uh, in a public blockchain,

735
00:44:56,250 --> 00:44:58,650
people can see what's
happening on those rails.

736
00:44:58,860 --> 00:45:02,370
We could open up a browser right now
and you'd be able to see every single

737
00:45:02,371 --> 00:45:05,340
transaction that's occurring
on the bitcoin blockchain.

738
00:45:05,820 --> 00:45:08,700
So folks should keep in mind those two.
Again,

739
00:45:08,701 --> 00:45:11,580
as we develop more advanced
blockchain solutions, uh,

740
00:45:11,690 --> 00:45:16,690
it's going to be a very important tool
for guaranteeing the privacy of data.

741
00:45:17,190 --> 00:45:20,640
Uh, but, uh, at least as
it's used for transactions,

742
00:45:20,660 --> 00:45:25,190
folks shouldn't be under the illusion
that their information is a anonymous or

743
00:45:25,200 --> 00:45:28,060
secure in that regard.
And forgive it,

744
00:45:28,110 --> 00:45:29,700
forgive me if this is
a rudimentary question,

745
00:45:29,701 --> 00:45:32,700
but from an ecosystem
perspective in the future,

746
00:45:32,701 --> 00:45:34,020
may say five years down the line,

747
00:45:34,830 --> 00:45:38,670
having an ecosystem in which you have a
number of blockchains versus maybe one

748
00:45:38,671 --> 00:45:40,980
or two main ones in which
everybody can pile into.

749
00:45:41,580 --> 00:45:45,970
Is there a preferable approach here or
will it not really matter? And you know,

750
00:45:45,990 --> 00:45:47,630
per use case will dictate the,

751
00:45:47,650 --> 00:45:52,650
the development of one main blockchain
or several smaller ones for interested

752
00:45:52,681 --> 00:45:56,850
parties, so to speak. Very
important question. Uh, and again,

753
00:45:56,851 --> 00:46:00,180
I would harken back to 1992,

754
00:46:00,181 --> 00:46:02,430
1993 for an analog here.

755
00:46:02,850 --> 00:46:07,260
What we saw at that time as that a lot
of companies and a lot of different

756
00:46:07,261 --> 00:46:12,261
organizations started setting up these
very novel things called intranets that

757
00:46:12,361 --> 00:46:14,820
many of us will recall.
And they said, well,

758
00:46:14,821 --> 00:46:16,890
there's this weird space
called the Internet.

759
00:46:16,891 --> 00:46:21,010
We're not sure that we want to be a part
of that yet, but we'll, we'll play, uh,

760
00:46:21,060 --> 00:46:25,050
within our organization for a little
while and see how we like sharing

761
00:46:25,051 --> 00:46:28,260
information using these new
rails within our organization.

762
00:46:28,770 --> 00:46:31,860
And after a couple of years, everybody
said, wow, this is really cool.

763
00:46:31,861 --> 00:46:35,220
But it's also kind of stupid that we
can't talk to our friends that work across

764
00:46:35,221 --> 00:46:37,330
the street or do business with them.
Uh,

765
00:46:37,360 --> 00:46:42,120
and so we're now going to ladder
up to the Internet. And you know,

766
00:46:42,121 --> 00:46:44,940
you guys, I think know the
rest of that story. Uh,

767
00:46:44,970 --> 00:46:48,450
my expectation is that we're going
to see something pretty similar, uh,

768
00:46:48,451 --> 00:46:50,250
occur in the blockchain space.

769
00:46:50,550 --> 00:46:54,120
There will be a lot of
different flavors early on. Uh,

770
00:46:54,150 --> 00:46:59,150
we will see lots of analogs to intranet
being stood up and eventually those

771
00:47:00,421 --> 00:47:05,070
solutions will come together and it'll
be very seamless for organizations to

772
00:47:05,071 --> 00:47:08,670
work, uh, on blockchains
across different platforms.

773
00:47:08,760 --> 00:47:10,590
Probably using one or two,

774
00:47:10,700 --> 00:47:15,030
a big main spines as they're the
conduit for a lot of that interaction.

775
00:47:15,580 --> 00:47:20,520
Uh, thank you for all the information.
Um, I just have one question.

776
00:47:20,520 --> 00:47:22,380
You mentioned something about,
uh,

777
00:47:22,410 --> 00:47:25,800
investing in the picks and shovels.

778
00:47:26,610 --> 00:47:30,100
Could you talk a little bit more
about what exactly you mean? Yeah.

779
00:47:30,160 --> 00:47:31,780
So some company,

780
00:47:31,870 --> 00:47:36,730
some entities are using a
cryptocurrencies and, and that's great.

781
00:47:36,731 --> 00:47:38,710
Cryptocurrencies as we've discussed,

782
00:47:38,960 --> 00:47:41,620
I had the potential to be useful
for a lot of different things,

783
00:47:41,920 --> 00:47:46,420
especially in countries that have bad
financial governance and where citizens

784
00:47:46,421 --> 00:47:50,080
are looking for alternatives,
uh, in, in my mind,

785
00:47:50,560 --> 00:47:55,360
what is more exciting even than that and
what has captured the imagination of a

786
00:47:55,361 --> 00:48:00,361
lot of folks as the ability to use
blockchain as a vehicle for other

787
00:48:00,431 --> 00:48:01,700
applications.
Uh,

788
00:48:01,710 --> 00:48:06,370
and the tools that are going to be built
on top of blockchain or that harness

789
00:48:06,371 --> 00:48:10,270
blockchain, uh, I think are going
to be every bit as valuable,

790
00:48:10,271 --> 00:48:14,140
if not more so to humanity in
the long run. Uh, then, uh,

791
00:48:14,170 --> 00:48:18,110
the cryptocurrencies that are kind
of the first killer app, uh, for, uh,

792
00:48:18,130 --> 00:48:21,700
the technology that we're, we're, I
think all excited about right now.

793
00:48:21,910 --> 00:48:22,743
Does that make sense?

794
00:48:23,440 --> 00:48:23,770
Um,

795
00:48:23,770 --> 00:48:28,770
you just mentioned how we
can use a blockchain to help
you hold governments more

796
00:48:29,511 --> 00:48:33,900
accountable, but at the same time, we need
cooperation from governments, you know,

797
00:48:33,920 --> 00:48:38,450
to give the original information. So,
in that push and pool, how would you,

798
00:48:38,480 --> 00:48:42,740
how do you sort of foresee how to
use it as accountability mechanism?

799
00:48:43,520 --> 00:48:47,780
You know, especially with the most
corrupt or entities or departments or,

800
00:48:48,110 --> 00:48:50,330
you know, um, whichever areas,

801
00:48:51,070 --> 00:48:52,240
great question.

802
00:48:52,330 --> 00:48:56,080
Blockchain works best when
people want to be accountable.

803
00:48:56,650 --> 00:49:00,190
When you have an organization that
wants to do things the right way,

804
00:49:00,250 --> 00:49:03,760
that is willing to give good
data, uh, because frankly,

805
00:49:03,761 --> 00:49:08,410
you're not doing anybody any favors
if you put bad data into a blockchain.

806
00:49:08,440 --> 00:49:12,250
That's one of the key lessons that we've
learned in our work thus far as you

807
00:49:12,251 --> 00:49:17,251
really don't want to deploy blockchain
in a setting where you don't have access

808
00:49:17,561 --> 00:49:19,290
to good clean data.
Um,

809
00:49:19,410 --> 00:49:23,440
so you need actors that are willing to,
uh,

810
00:49:24,490 --> 00:49:27,730
willing to move toward a solution.
Uh, early in the process.

811
00:49:28,030 --> 00:49:31,530
There are still going to be
some instances, for example, uh,

812
00:49:31,670 --> 00:49:35,070
if you're in a situation where you have,
uh,

813
00:49:35,110 --> 00:49:38,830
evidence of humanitarian
abuses or war crimes,

814
00:49:39,340 --> 00:49:43,900
I can envision a scenario in the not
distant future where a reporter on the

815
00:49:43,901 --> 00:49:46,870
ground in Syria or in DR Congo,

816
00:49:47,140 --> 00:49:52,060
we'll be at the log video to block
chain and create an iron clad chain of

817
00:49:52,061 --> 00:49:56,800
evidence that will be useful for
a future war crimes prosecutions.

818
00:49:57,130 --> 00:49:57,270
Uh,

819
00:49:57,270 --> 00:50:02,270
so you can easily come up with scenarios
in which the tool can be harnessed in

820
00:50:02,651 --> 00:50:04,750
settings where there's bad governance,
uh,

821
00:50:04,900 --> 00:50:09,900
but the most profound benefits are likely
going to occur in settings where you

822
00:50:10,181 --> 00:50:14,380
have political leaders that want to
do the right thing and bureaucratic

823
00:50:14,410 --> 00:50:18,490
bureaucracies and institutions that
don't have the capability for whatever

824
00:50:18,491 --> 00:50:21,010
reason, uh, to deliver
accountability. And,

825
00:50:21,050 --> 00:50:24,220
and hopefully in those instances
it can be pretty transformational.

826
00:50:25,620 --> 00:50:29,060
So I'm going to think it's going to
start with good guys first and then

827
00:50:29,420 --> 00:50:34,190
gradually progressed to the most corrupt
ones and they're going to be eventually

828
00:50:34,280 --> 00:50:36,750
recurrence.
That's been the path thus far.

829
00:50:36,751 --> 00:50:40,490
And what I would say on that point is
eventually, again, if we do this right,

830
00:50:41,030 --> 00:50:45,890
the gravitational pull of being part
of these systems is going to be so

831
00:50:45,891 --> 00:50:48,590
profound. The benefits of, uh,

832
00:50:48,800 --> 00:50:53,520
being part of these networks will be so
profound that every government is going

833
00:50:53,530 --> 00:50:56,480
to want to be a part of this. Uh,
because if you're not just like,

834
00:50:56,481 --> 00:50:59,870
it's really hard to exist in
the 21st century if you're
not part of the Internet,

835
00:51:00,290 --> 00:51:04,430
uh, it's going to be hard to exist if you
can't send assets back and forth using

836
00:51:04,431 --> 00:51:05,061
these tools.

837
00:51:05,061 --> 00:51:10,061
Or if you can't reliably and accountably
track some of the key vital information

838
00:51:12,090 --> 00:51:13,730
watching this will be used to track.

839
00:51:15,500 --> 00:51:19,970
I'm just trying to understand the specific
advantage that blockchain would give

840
00:51:19,971 --> 00:51:24,110
in the example you used is a good one
that distributed solar in the developing

841
00:51:24,140 --> 00:51:24,950
world.
I mean,

842
00:51:24,950 --> 00:51:29,270
because those kinds of financing
schemes exist now pay as you go mobile

843
00:51:29,450 --> 00:51:30,770
payments,
mobile money.

844
00:51:31,040 --> 00:51:34,910
So what is the actual incremental benefit
of doing that in blockchain versus

845
00:51:34,911 --> 00:51:35,780
what's already being done?

846
00:51:36,280 --> 00:51:37,380
Well,
blockchain in,

847
00:51:37,381 --> 00:51:41,710
in a whole host of settings in emerging
markets is going to allow for much

848
00:51:41,711 --> 00:51:46,711
higher levels of confidence when it
comes to pushing resources into the field

849
00:51:46,810 --> 00:51:48,560
and tracking impact.
Uh,

850
00:51:48,610 --> 00:51:52,870
and so as a tool for impact investment
and in particular it could be really

851
00:51:52,871 --> 00:51:56,080
transformational. What it
will allow us to do if, again,

852
00:51:56,081 --> 00:51:57,610
if we build these systems right,

853
00:51:57,670 --> 00:52:02,670
is set up enough data sensors and data
inputs that we have a very good idea,

854
00:52:04,610 --> 00:52:08,850
uh, of what the outcomes are
associated with these investments. Um,

855
00:52:08,910 --> 00:52:10,330
so for example,

856
00:52:10,360 --> 00:52:14,080
if you are considering whether
to finance the shipment,

857
00:52:14,370 --> 00:52:18,580
a lot of these batteries,
solar systems to small rural villages,

858
00:52:19,150 --> 00:52:22,780
you need really good data on
which to base that financing.

859
00:52:22,810 --> 00:52:27,530
You want to know exactly where the
systems are, how they're being used, uh,

860
00:52:27,550 --> 00:52:30,910
the rates at which those
payments are being replenished.

861
00:52:31,260 --> 00:52:34,330
And it's going to make it easier
for everyone to trust each other.

862
00:52:34,331 --> 00:52:39,330
Especially in settings where there's a
low level of confidence in the data. Um,

863
00:52:39,400 --> 00:52:42,470
the analog I might provide
is that if you and I, uh,

864
00:52:42,490 --> 00:52:46,030
decided you want to build a house and
you want me to build it for you and I'm

865
00:52:46,031 --> 00:52:47,830
going to hire some subcontractors.

866
00:52:48,310 --> 00:52:52,810
If we decide at the outset that we're
all gonna use the same set of books for

867
00:52:52,811 --> 00:52:55,330
that transaction,
for that project,

868
00:52:55,750 --> 00:52:59,290
everyone's comfort level is going to
go way up because we can all see what's

869
00:52:59,291 --> 00:53:03,230
happening. We all know where the money
is at every given at any given time, uh,

870
00:53:03,240 --> 00:53:06,850
and you have confidence that nobody's
ripping you off. Uh, along the way.

871
00:53:07,360 --> 00:53:11,170
That's what we should be able to do at
scale with blockchain deployments in

872
00:53:11,171 --> 00:53:12,400
emerging market environments,

873
00:53:12,770 --> 00:53:17,720
do you see quantum computing
as a existential threat
for blockchain technology?

874
00:53:18,280 --> 00:53:22,720
That's a very important question.
Uh, no is the short answer.

875
00:53:22,750 --> 00:53:26,970
The reason why is because there's a
lot of work underway to develop quantum

876
00:53:26,971 --> 00:53:28,960
resistant blockchains.
Uh,

877
00:53:28,961 --> 00:53:33,961
and these are watching is that will
be based on a quantum market texture,

878
00:53:34,111 --> 00:53:38,730
will harness quantum architecture, uh,
in ways that make them extremely secure.

879
00:53:39,030 --> 00:53:40,530
Now,
in the immediate term,

880
00:53:40,531 --> 00:53:44,550
if somebody were to come up with a fully
functional quantum computer tomorrow

881
00:53:44,940 --> 00:53:49,380
prior to the full maturation of quantum
resistant blockchain technology,

882
00:53:49,560 --> 00:53:51,560
then it would be a challenge. Uh, but the,

883
00:53:51,561 --> 00:53:54,840
the hope is that these two
will progress in parallel. Uh,

884
00:53:54,910 --> 00:53:59,760
and ultimately you should be able to port
existing data onto quantum resistance

885
00:53:59,970 --> 00:54:01,170
blockchains in the future.

886
00:54:02,000 --> 00:54:05,330
I hate to Micah, um, I
had a question about, um,

887
00:54:05,920 --> 00:54:07,440
I'm not quite exactly
sure how to express it,

888
00:54:07,441 --> 00:54:12,060
but maybe you'll get the gist of my
question that like, um, if we depend on,

889
00:54:12,570 --> 00:54:13,160
uh,

890
00:54:13,160 --> 00:54:18,160
like organizations that want transparency
and want to be good actors to like use

891
00:54:19,171 --> 00:54:23,820
blockchain, like it seems like it would
be a rather limiting because like,

892
00:54:23,821 --> 00:54:24,631
we've already seen stuff,

893
00:54:24,631 --> 00:54:28,080
like I feel like the American government
is pretty hostile to the idea of like

894
00:54:28,140 --> 00:54:32,670
lots of, lots of economic activity going
to like Bitcoin for instance. Right?

895
00:54:32,671 --> 00:54:35,340
Because they want to be able to control
things. They want to go to tax things,

896
00:54:35,341 --> 00:54:37,170
that sort of thing. Right. Um,

897
00:54:37,900 --> 00:54:41,970
when in inherently lead to
situations where like, um,

898
00:54:43,800 --> 00:54:47,790
you'll, you'll like the only people who
will be willing to take the risk of going

899
00:54:47,791 --> 00:54:51,270
through all the trouble to like go through
these things will be the people who

900
00:54:51,271 --> 00:54:53,100
are doing things that are kind of shady,
right?

901
00:54:53,101 --> 00:54:55,400
Because like if I wanted
to do something like,

902
00:54:55,610 --> 00:54:57,300
like buy a book with Bitcoin right now,

903
00:54:57,301 --> 00:54:59,880
it's like way more effort
than just using USD, right?

904
00:55:00,180 --> 00:55:02,880
Like how do we overcome that thing if,

905
00:55:03,060 --> 00:55:07,500
if cryptocurrencies ever actually going
to be useful, you know, in, in general,

906
00:55:08,360 --> 00:55:11,250
one of the coolest things I
got to do in government, uh,

907
00:55:11,270 --> 00:55:16,190
his work with the then secretary of state
on the first big speech that anybody

908
00:55:16,220 --> 00:55:18,950
in the u s government had ever given
on the topic of Internet freedom.

909
00:55:19,580 --> 00:55:23,680
And in that speech we made a
really important point. Uh,

910
00:55:23,860 --> 00:55:25,880
this was back in when
I was a speech writer.

911
00:55:25,910 --> 00:55:29,960
That technology itself is neutral,

912
00:55:30,080 --> 00:55:35,080
but we're not and we have an obligation
to harness these technologies as best

913
00:55:35,301 --> 00:55:40,160
we're able to benefit society.
Blockchain is no different in that regard.

914
00:55:40,430 --> 00:55:44,090
It's got immense potential to do good
things as we've talked about today,

915
00:55:44,540 --> 00:55:47,960
but it can also be misused in
a wide range of applications.

916
00:55:47,961 --> 00:55:50,680
And we've seen a fair
amount of that already. Uh,

917
00:55:50,900 --> 00:55:55,130
so I think the two sides of this,
the first is ironically,

918
00:55:55,220 --> 00:55:58,790
even the u s government is pretty
enthusiastic about the potential for

919
00:55:58,791 --> 00:56:03,440
blockchain technology because they
understand that again, done right.

920
00:56:03,710 --> 00:56:05,580
This could be the end of friction.
Uh,

921
00:56:05,700 --> 00:56:09,500
if you think of all the little nuisances
that make our lives more complicated

922
00:56:09,501 --> 00:56:10,334
and expensive,

923
00:56:10,700 --> 00:56:15,700
this if you carry it to which its logical
conclusion and spaces like identity

924
00:56:15,741 --> 00:56:20,741
and a finance could wipe away
a lot of those obstacles that,

925
00:56:20,961 --> 00:56:23,770
uh, you know, make our lives
a little bit cumbersome.

926
00:56:24,130 --> 00:56:28,240
So they see the potential on a lot of
governments realize that potential. Uh,

927
00:56:28,330 --> 00:56:31,960
ultimately it's up to those of us
who've taken the time to understand the

928
00:56:31,961 --> 00:56:35,610
technology and that's still a
very small universe of people, uh,

929
00:56:35,800 --> 00:56:40,250
to try to steer it in ways that it will
be used. Well. Um, but you know, the,

930
00:56:40,251 --> 00:56:45,010
the point you make is, is
really important. We need to
get to a stage quickly, uh,

931
00:56:45,011 --> 00:56:47,890
where we can demonstrate
real value for society.

932
00:56:47,891 --> 00:56:51,910
And that's what we're working on. Happy
to discuss further as well. Good question.

933
00:56:52,180 --> 00:56:53,920
Uh, so my question was, um,

934
00:56:53,980 --> 00:56:58,980
mostly about bitcoin miners and the
reason they mined bitcoin is because it's

935
00:57:00,011 --> 00:57:04,030
financially that's the incentive that
they get much of it kind of the end of it.

936
00:57:04,660 --> 00:57:09,220
Um, as time goes on, the benefits of
mining bitcoin are going to decrease.

937
00:57:09,221 --> 00:57:12,730
So how is this problem being soldered?
Um,

938
00:57:13,570 --> 00:57:14,650
that's basically it.

939
00:57:15,000 --> 00:57:18,750
Important question. Uh, so
the, the context on this,

940
00:57:18,751 --> 00:57:23,010
which I imagine will be familiar to
most of you is that the reason this vast

941
00:57:23,011 --> 00:57:28,011
network of data centers exists is because
about every 10 minutes as a new block

942
00:57:29,040 --> 00:57:31,540
of information is locked in.
Uh,

943
00:57:31,890 --> 00:57:36,890
the data center that does that work is
rewarded with 12 and a half bitcoin,

944
00:57:37,620 --> 00:57:41,310
which now is $200,000
or something like that.

945
00:57:41,311 --> 00:57:45,870
So it's a strong incentive
to secure the network. Uh,

946
00:57:45,930 --> 00:57:50,930
the number of bitcoin that will be
awarded will decrease in time to a point

947
00:57:51,631 --> 00:57:52,231
where,
you know,

948
00:57:52,231 --> 00:57:57,090
out in the next century it dwindles to
almost not that there are transaction

949
00:57:57,091 --> 00:58:02,091
fees on bitcoin transactions that should
compensate for much of that decline.

950
00:58:03,060 --> 00:58:06,900
Um, the other thing is we are seeing
bitcoin become more and more valuable.

951
00:58:06,930 --> 00:58:11,930
So even though the number of bitcoin
that will be awarded to the miners,

952
00:58:12,961 --> 00:58:17,961
the data center operators will decrease
the value of those bitcoin at least if

953
00:58:19,500 --> 00:58:23,180
the last couple of weeks are any
indication is likely to increase. Uh,

954
00:58:23,220 --> 00:58:27,070
and so between those two factors,
the transaction fees and,

955
00:58:27,071 --> 00:58:28,680
and the value increase,
uh,

956
00:58:28,681 --> 00:58:32,520
there should be strong incentives to
continue securing the network for a very

957
00:58:32,521 --> 00:58:33,354
long time to come.

958
00:58:33,940 --> 00:58:37,490
Would a crash bring things to a halt
because it's no longer profitability?

959
00:58:38,260 --> 00:58:42,040
Um, so long as people are using
the technology, uh, again,

960
00:58:42,041 --> 00:58:46,540
the transaction fees are such, there
are good incentives at the moment, uh,

961
00:58:46,690 --> 00:58:50,050
for the data centers to continue
doing what they're doing. Uh,

962
00:58:50,051 --> 00:58:53,620
it's something that people will want
to continue paying attention to. Uh,

963
00:58:53,680 --> 00:58:57,850
but for the time being, it has all the
makings of a very resilient network.

964
00:58:58,710 --> 00:59:02,650
Alright. Yeah. Thank you so
much. This was extremely,

965
00:59:02,651 --> 00:59:06,310
extremely interesting and
useful and informative.

966
00:59:06,920 --> 00:59:11,570
I want to thank you again for
joining us and coming and yeah,

967
00:59:11,680 --> 00:59:16,570
the best of luck with your
efforts. Um, spreading the word.

968
00:59:16,880 --> 00:59:19,550
Thank you. It's, it's an
exciting space and, uh, you know,

969
00:59:19,551 --> 00:59:24,020
for all of you here and watching both
for the blockchain trust accelerator and

970
00:59:24,021 --> 00:59:26,070
the Global Blockchain Business Council,
uh,

971
00:59:26,071 --> 00:59:28,820
we're always looking for great
partners and great challenge.

972
00:59:28,821 --> 00:59:32,180
And hopefully we'll get a chance to
collaborate in some of these efforts down

973
00:59:32,181 --> 00:59:33,014
the road.

974
00:59:34,260 --> 00:59:37,830
[inaudible].
