1
00:00:05,950 --> 00:00:08,470
Uh, but today we have a
very exciting speaker here.

2
00:00:08,500 --> 00:00:11,620
I'll funds out to Villa Alfonzo
and he's here from ames.

3
00:00:12,070 --> 00:00:16,000
He's been with Ames about 10 years and
this just recently become a civil servant.

4
00:00:16,060 --> 00:00:20,230
And before that was a contractor
with Seti working at aims. So,

5
00:00:20,860 --> 00:00:25,510
um, he is currently in the
exobiology branch of Nasa Ames,

6
00:00:25,900 --> 00:00:29,470
uh, looking at terrestrial analog
environments to assess the potential,

7
00:00:29,471 --> 00:00:33,940
how about habitability of other planetary
bodies and developing strategies for

8
00:00:33,941 --> 00:00:37,870
life detection based on first
principles in biology and biochemistry.

9
00:00:38,470 --> 00:00:42,610
Currently he conducts field investigations
in the most extreme deserts on earth,

10
00:00:42,910 --> 00:00:47,320
provide scientific advice for
the maturation of instruments
of space exploration

11
00:00:47,620 --> 00:00:51,820
and helps develop mission concepts to
surf search for as evidence of life on

12
00:00:51,821 --> 00:00:56,710
Mars, Europa. And, and so I'm
selling this and sell it us. Yes.

13
00:00:56,740 --> 00:01:01,210
Thank you. Name. Yes. I'll
know it really well. So, um,

14
00:01:01,240 --> 00:01:02,800
please help me welcome.
I'll find them.

15
00:01:06,690 --> 00:01:08,200
Thank you. Thanks for
[inaudible]. We're calming

16
00:01:08,200 --> 00:01:12,760
and thanks. Everybody was listening
on the radio waves. Um, the,

17
00:01:12,761 --> 00:01:13,890
um,
I'm,

18
00:01:14,620 --> 00:01:18,310
I'm happy to be here and share some of
the latest thinking that our group has

19
00:01:18,311 --> 00:01:21,000
been developing at NASA ames in
terms of the search for life,

20
00:01:21,001 --> 00:01:25,600
specifically the search for a second
genesis of life. So, uh, to begin with,

21
00:01:25,601 --> 00:01:28,660
I'll tell you what the motivation
is for me to be here here.

22
00:01:28,661 --> 00:01:33,130
Meaning aims studying these,
these specific topics and
the way we do it that way.

23
00:01:33,131 --> 00:01:35,580
When I first landed at Ames 10 years ago,
uh,

24
00:01:35,800 --> 00:01:40,210
my mentor back then gave me the most
important advice that I've received in my

25
00:01:40,360 --> 00:01:43,540
career. And he said, the most
important question in science,

26
00:01:43,541 --> 00:01:47,530
you always have to keep asking yourself
is why every time you make a decision,

27
00:01:47,540 --> 00:01:49,570
you decide to do something as yourself.
Why?

28
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:53,080
And that applies to the questions you're
asking, how you're addressing them,

29
00:01:53,290 --> 00:01:56,800
why you're addressing them that way, why
that experiment, why their observation.

30
00:01:57,160 --> 00:01:58,870
So it's constant. Why, why,

31
00:01:58,871 --> 00:02:02,470
why it takes us today to the kind of
topic did we were talking and discussing.

32
00:02:02,710 --> 00:02:05,560
And it's, as you will see, there's
still a lot of that needs to be done.

33
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:10,810
But why is the [inaudible] a question
behind all these now itself, this,

34
00:02:10,811 --> 00:02:11,710
this question itself,

35
00:02:11,711 --> 00:02:16,210
it leads to a self doubt and
longterm psychological damage,

36
00:02:16,211 --> 00:02:19,660
but that's secondary. As long as
your science is good, he said, ah,

37
00:02:19,661 --> 00:02:23,890
your papers are going to be solid.
Just keep asking why. And so, uh,

38
00:02:24,100 --> 00:02:26,230
really in asking why are
we searching for a sec?

39
00:02:26,231 --> 00:02:29,860
Why are we searching for life in the
first place? Why should we water? Uh,

40
00:02:29,861 --> 00:02:33,340
and then, uh, starting to
go down the uh, the uh,

41
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:35,860
chain of reasoning,
the chain of logic.

42
00:02:36,250 --> 00:02:39,810
A lot of these you're going to see today
that's, that's what came out of these,

43
00:02:39,870 --> 00:02:44,870
these kind of asking why now this is
probably the best reason why we should

44
00:02:45,311 --> 00:02:48,340
bother about, we should care about
searching for a second genesis of life.

45
00:02:48,820 --> 00:02:52,540
And some of you might sympathize with
the concept is the zero one infinity rule

46
00:02:53,020 --> 00:02:55,300
is the idea that things,
there are three shapes,

47
00:02:55,450 --> 00:02:58,390
free forms and things can
exist in the universe. Uh,

48
00:02:58,391 --> 00:03:03,220
either they don't or they unique are,
there is many of them really to,

49
00:03:03,670 --> 00:03:06,400
there's no such thing as
two things in the universe.

50
00:03:06,850 --> 00:03:10,900
And so right now we are uh, pause
the zero. There's live on earth.

51
00:03:11,110 --> 00:03:13,770
So we know there is a loose
one example in our equation,

52
00:03:13,830 --> 00:03:15,880
in our equation of life in the universe.

53
00:03:15,881 --> 00:03:19,660
The question is whether it's the unique
one or there is infinite forms of life

54
00:03:19,661 --> 00:03:22,180
and it only takes one other,
in my opinion,

55
00:03:22,360 --> 00:03:26,470
form of life out there that shares does
not share in origin with live on earth

56
00:03:26,860 --> 00:03:30,370
to conclude that there is infinite forms
of life in the universe that's only

57
00:03:30,520 --> 00:03:33,460
based on the sheer number
of exoplanets there are.

58
00:03:33,790 --> 00:03:38,790
We know that are out there and how many
of those we know have likely the right

59
00:03:39,641 --> 00:03:42,010
conditions to support life.
Now,

60
00:03:42,070 --> 00:03:45,520
I'm not going to focus on exit planets
today cause it turns out that our own

61
00:03:45,521 --> 00:03:49,510
solar system already has plenty of places
where life could actually potentially

62
00:03:49,511 --> 00:03:49,941
exist.

63
00:03:49,941 --> 00:03:54,941
The places that in fact a microorganism
micro organisms on earth will be able to

64
00:03:55,210 --> 00:03:57,780
not only survive those environments
were actually thrive in them.

65
00:03:58,550 --> 00:04:01,030
We're going to run through
some of those examples today.

66
00:04:02,290 --> 00:04:04,450
So the motivation is very simple,
fine.

67
00:04:04,451 --> 00:04:07,430
Another example of life so that we
can convince ourselves that life isn't

68
00:04:07,450 --> 00:04:09,700
actually,
it's an actual cosmic phenomenon.

69
00:04:09,850 --> 00:04:12,850
It's not something that happened
once accidentally on our planet.

70
00:04:13,540 --> 00:04:16,360
And so what we're looking for,
as I just said right now,

71
00:04:16,361 --> 00:04:20,920
there is an example of one, there's no
escaping that that motivates the search.

72
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:25,180
It also limits the way we search because
our knowledge is based on these one

73
00:04:25,181 --> 00:04:29,740
example of life in the universe and as
scientist we've been struggling for many

74
00:04:29,740 --> 00:04:34,080
years on going from a data
number of one to what the,

75
00:04:34,450 --> 00:04:37,540
all the rent to cover all of the
possible range of all the possible,

76
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:40,180
all the possibilities for
life outside of the planet.

77
00:04:40,420 --> 00:04:43,330
Obviously you're continuously being
limited and constrained by your

78
00:04:43,331 --> 00:04:45,610
understanding of what you know.
And in this case,

79
00:04:45,611 --> 00:04:48,380
what we know is only one live on earth.
The,

80
00:04:48,490 --> 00:04:50,620
despite all its diversity,

81
00:04:51,010 --> 00:04:54,070
when you look at it from the mentally at
the chemical level of life on earth is

82
00:04:54,071 --> 00:04:58,150
very non diverse. It's very,
uh, it's all very similar.

83
00:04:58,270 --> 00:05:01,420
We'll talk about this in a second.
Now what we,

84
00:05:01,660 --> 00:05:05,350
what we really mean by a second.
Genesis of life is exactly this,

85
00:05:05,750 --> 00:05:08,590
a form of life not
related to live on earth.

86
00:05:08,591 --> 00:05:13,591
Now this is a simple statement but
it's not clear to a lot of people and

87
00:05:13,661 --> 00:05:14,980
including a lot of researchers.

88
00:05:15,160 --> 00:05:19,190
What the meaning of a second
genesis really means release. Uh,

89
00:05:19,420 --> 00:05:23,200
something that is not related to us.
It's not something that easy to, uh,

90
00:05:23,320 --> 00:05:27,280
it's not a question that easy
to address. Okay. What's next?

91
00:05:27,430 --> 00:05:30,350
So I'm going to go with for a number of
places I just told you in the secondary

92
00:05:30,351 --> 00:05:31,330
is lots of examples.

93
00:05:31,330 --> 00:05:35,770
Now we know of many exoplanets that are
at the right distance from their parents,

94
00:05:35,771 --> 00:05:36,730
started with liquid water,

95
00:05:36,731 --> 00:05:39,420
could be stable on the surface
that's great for exobiology,

96
00:05:39,790 --> 00:05:42,400
but we're actually interested or I am
actually interested in the possibility of

97
00:05:42,401 --> 00:05:44,990
life in the solar system.
Not for anything but the,

98
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:48,940
but because of the fact that any
form of life nor in the solar system,

99
00:05:49,270 --> 00:05:53,500
it's almost irrelevant to us.
We will never be able to look at it.

100
00:05:53,530 --> 00:05:56,230
We will never be able to interact
with it in a direct manner.

101
00:05:56,290 --> 00:06:00,410
Just because of the enormous distance
between the, uh, all different stars.

102
00:06:00,740 --> 00:06:05,180
Only a form of life in our solar system
outside of the earth could help us

103
00:06:05,181 --> 00:06:09,590
really understand the basic principles
of life could help us develop a theory of

104
00:06:09,591 --> 00:06:13,970
life because that's a form of light we
could dissect, we could break apart,

105
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:17,300
we could analyze in detail at the same
way we are. We analyze life on earth,

106
00:06:17,960 --> 00:06:22,550
life on an exoplanet. Awesome.
But other than we know it's there,

107
00:06:22,790 --> 00:06:25,800
it wouldn't really help as
advanced scientifically much, uh,

108
00:06:25,850 --> 00:06:28,990
about the understanding of life and,
and the,

109
00:06:29,030 --> 00:06:31,820
and the way life originated and all these
interesting questions that motivates

110
00:06:31,821 --> 00:06:35,780
the search. Now, it turns out
that there, there is a certain,

111
00:06:35,810 --> 00:06:39,050
there is a fair number of places in the
solar system that we could potentially

112
00:06:39,051 --> 00:06:40,610
think about searching
for evidence of life.

113
00:06:40,640 --> 00:06:44,000
The first one that comes to mind
is present day, Maurice. Um,

114
00:06:44,450 --> 00:06:48,770
we know for a fact that Mars is not,
it's not a habitable planet today.

115
00:06:48,771 --> 00:06:53,120
Anything we know, any form of life we
know of would die on the surface of Mars.

116
00:06:53,121 --> 00:06:58,121
Almost immediately need to exposure of
either toxic chemistry in the soil or UV

117
00:06:58,941 --> 00:07:01,240
radiation. Uh, not,

118
00:07:01,550 --> 00:07:04,040
not to speak about the cold
temperatures and all that nasty stuff,

119
00:07:04,520 --> 00:07:08,720
but we know that conditions on the
surface of Mars do change with time,

120
00:07:08,721 --> 00:07:11,810
just like conditions on the earth.
There are ice ages on Mars,

121
00:07:11,960 --> 00:07:15,290
same way that there are ice ages and
earth triggered by changes in the earth,

122
00:07:15,740 --> 00:07:17,090
orbital parameters of the planet,

123
00:07:17,570 --> 00:07:22,250
and we know that only five to 10 million
years ago conditions on the surface of

124
00:07:22,251 --> 00:07:22,551
Mars,

125
00:07:22,551 --> 00:07:27,350
we're actually warming off to meld some
of these occurrences of ground dies very

126
00:07:27,351 --> 00:07:30,170
close to the surface. These an
impact crater on the surface of Mars.

127
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:31,700
That happened very recently.

128
00:07:31,701 --> 00:07:35,390
It was actually captured in 2008 there is
a number of documented cases like this.

129
00:07:35,720 --> 00:07:36,560
It was small,

130
00:07:36,561 --> 00:07:40,460
but it was big enough to excavate some
of these white stuff and these white

131
00:07:40,461 --> 00:07:43,910
stuff turns out to be water
ice very close to the surface.

132
00:07:44,090 --> 00:07:47,750
And some of these craters are fun
here in the mid latitudes of Mars.

133
00:07:47,751 --> 00:07:50,780
Actually Vl to here is the
Viking to landing site.

134
00:07:51,080 --> 00:07:54,890
Viking might've missed ground eyes
only by about 10 centimeters. Uh,

135
00:07:54,920 --> 00:07:59,470
back in 1975 research Mars exploration
would have been a lot different if biking

136
00:07:59,510 --> 00:08:03,890
had excavated a tiny bit deeper into
the soil. But the bottom line is that,

137
00:08:04,340 --> 00:08:06,020
uh,
at these low latitudes,

138
00:08:06,040 --> 00:08:08,570
there is examples of ground dies
is very close to the surface,

139
00:08:08,571 --> 00:08:12,980
less than one meter. These ground
eyes can get warming off, uh,

140
00:08:13,010 --> 00:08:15,620
during high obliquity periods for these,
uh,

141
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:18,350
for these to melt and generate
conditions that it leads,

142
00:08:18,351 --> 00:08:19,610
could be transiently habitable.

143
00:08:19,730 --> 00:08:22,940
So it's a very interesting place to
search for possible evidence of life.

144
00:08:23,270 --> 00:08:28,270
Now I like to think of Mars as
actually a tale of two planets.

145
00:08:29,390 --> 00:08:32,960
Um,
early Mars was a very different planet.

146
00:08:33,430 --> 00:08:37,830
I think of it as different, in fact,
as a different planet. And the way we,

147
00:08:37,940 --> 00:08:40,090
we might want to search for
life in that plan is different.

148
00:08:40,091 --> 00:08:42,230
The way we would search
for life on Mars today.

149
00:08:42,680 --> 00:08:47,000
We know now based on data
from the curiosity rover
that there were legs of Mars

150
00:08:47,060 --> 00:08:48,590
about three and a half billion years ago,

151
00:08:48,860 --> 00:08:52,880
that those lakes would have been habitable
to lifeforms to live the life forms

152
00:08:53,210 --> 00:08:56,280
that exist today on the earth. Even
to us. We could drain that water.

153
00:08:56,310 --> 00:09:00,300
The Ph was okay. The saltiness was
okay, the composition was fine.

154
00:09:00,450 --> 00:09:03,360
There was nothing in that water
will prevent life from growing it.

155
00:09:03,361 --> 00:09:05,520
It had all their,
all their requirements,

156
00:09:05,521 --> 00:09:09,450
nutrients and energy sources to grow
and reproduce that existed on the planet

157
00:09:09,451 --> 00:09:10,500
three and a half billion years ago.

158
00:09:10,501 --> 00:09:14,280
There is evidence that there were many
such examples of habitable environments

159
00:09:14,281 --> 00:09:15,540
on the surface.
In fact,

160
00:09:15,541 --> 00:09:19,520
people have proposed the existence
of a large northern ocean, uh,

161
00:09:19,530 --> 00:09:22,890
in the northern hemisphere of Mars
occupying a big portion off the planet

162
00:09:22,891 --> 00:09:26,010
surface. Uh, and now we have rovers.

163
00:09:26,310 --> 00:09:29,160
The MSL curiosity rover is
studying these sediments,

164
00:09:29,161 --> 00:09:31,560
which was the positive
in that lake environment,

165
00:09:31,561 --> 00:09:34,800
searching for possible chemical
signatures of habitability.

166
00:09:35,130 --> 00:09:39,570
And eventually if a either get lucky,
maybe chemical signatures of life.

167
00:09:39,990 --> 00:09:41,310
Uh,
a big,

168
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:44,910
a very important first step was the
discovery of organic matter reserved in

169
00:09:44,911 --> 00:09:46,440
those sediments.
Organics is,

170
00:09:46,441 --> 00:09:51,441
we will see is probably the
first requirement you need
as a scientist to decide

171
00:09:51,481 --> 00:09:55,260
to go searching for life on a place
just because the basic fact that life is

172
00:09:55,261 --> 00:09:56,220
made of organic matter.

173
00:09:56,700 --> 00:10:01,380
And so we do have the Mars
Science Laboratory mission
currently studying these

174
00:10:01,710 --> 00:10:03,290
environments.
The exomars,

175
00:10:03,300 --> 00:10:07,950
the European lender is going to go to
Mars in 2020 around 2020 kept getting

176
00:10:07,951 --> 00:10:10,590
delayed but hopefully
2020 is the last one. Uh,

177
00:10:10,620 --> 00:10:13,650
it's equipped to search for evidence
of light using several instruments.

178
00:10:14,040 --> 00:10:15,900
Mars 2020 is another NASA mission.

179
00:10:15,901 --> 00:10:19,320
There is being prepared for a to return
to Mars and maybe would be the first

180
00:10:19,321 --> 00:10:21,540
step towards a sample return mission.

181
00:10:21,840 --> 00:10:24,840
That will be the first mission that would
cash a sample or a number of samples

182
00:10:25,110 --> 00:10:28,290
and would wait for a future mission to
bring those samples back to Earth for

183
00:10:28,291 --> 00:10:28,950
study.

184
00:10:28,950 --> 00:10:33,360
So one possible place to for Mars 2020
to land would be one of those ancient

185
00:10:33,361 --> 00:10:37,380
lake deposits. So lots of
exciting things coming up. Now

186
00:10:39,960 --> 00:10:42,960
a lot of, most of the public is familiar
with this stuff. This is not new,

187
00:10:42,961 --> 00:10:46,710
but what's been developing in the last
few years is the concept of ocean worlds.

188
00:10:46,890 --> 00:10:50,160
Europa, you probably know about that
one. That's the moon of Jupiter.

189
00:10:50,370 --> 00:10:54,840
We know for a fact or as much of a fact
you can get without seeing it directly.

190
00:10:55,210 --> 00:10:59,730
A Europa has an ocean and there an
ice cover of about 90 kilometers,

191
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:04,150
50 of 60 miles. Uh, that
ocean, it's, it's been busted,

192
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:08,010
let him pretty much since the Galileo
missions one was 30 or 40 years ago.

193
00:11:08,310 --> 00:11:11,340
But now there is plenty of good evidence
based on morphology and the surface

194
00:11:11,341 --> 00:11:14,730
that there is in fact an ocean of liquid
water under the ice shell and that

195
00:11:14,731 --> 00:11:17,280
ocean is probably about a
hundred kilometers deep.

196
00:11:17,430 --> 00:11:21,030
There's plenty of a water down there.
Recently,

197
00:11:21,031 --> 00:11:26,031
there was indications of the plume of
water vapor ejecting from the surface of

198
00:11:26,221 --> 00:11:28,290
the planet that could be
linked to the subsurface ocean,

199
00:11:28,440 --> 00:11:31,020
although that hasn't been
demonstrated or validated yet.

200
00:11:31,140 --> 00:11:32,250
It's just one observation.

201
00:11:32,850 --> 00:11:36,050
Now these obviously makes it a very
interesting place for life or shouldn't

202
00:11:36,060 --> 00:11:40,620
liquid water, uh, deep far
away from nasty radiation.

203
00:11:41,110 --> 00:11:42,390
That could be an interesting place to go.

204
00:11:42,391 --> 00:11:44,730
Unfortunately technologically
is really hard to get there.

205
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,520
Now the astrobiology community,

206
00:11:47,550 --> 00:11:50,910
the planetary science community in general
has been always interested in landing

207
00:11:50,911 --> 00:11:52,710
on the surface of Europa.
Uh,

208
00:11:52,711 --> 00:11:56,230
for many we thought it will take
a not of God to actually do that

209
00:11:56,530 --> 00:12:00,280
technologically is vacant picketed.
It turns out it would be, it, it, it,

210
00:12:00,580 --> 00:12:03,340
it actually it was worth more than that.

211
00:12:03,341 --> 00:12:07,000
It actually took an act of Congress
for us to go to the surface of Europa.

212
00:12:07,030 --> 00:12:12,030
But last year Congress actually provided
some decks demanding or asking NASA to

213
00:12:14,201 --> 00:12:18,100
actually put together a mission to land
on the surface of Europa in the next

214
00:12:18,100 --> 00:12:21,040
decade and not only the land
but also to search for life.

215
00:12:21,400 --> 00:12:25,390
That got everybody very intrigued,
very excited. And there is currently a,

216
00:12:25,391 --> 00:12:28,030
there's going to be a call for
instruments at the end of this year,

217
00:12:28,060 --> 00:12:31,900
early next year for the
community to propose instruments
that would logo on that

218
00:12:31,901 --> 00:12:36,490
lender and that would probably
land on Europa hopefully, uh,

219
00:12:36,700 --> 00:12:40,270
within the next 10 years. And they
would go to a place on the surveys,

220
00:12:40,271 --> 00:12:41,920
probably one of these caves regions,

221
00:12:42,250 --> 00:12:46,000
which morphologically they look like
it's actually upwelling of ground water

222
00:12:46,001 --> 00:12:49,240
from the ocean going all the way through
the ice cover and then freezing on the

223
00:12:49,241 --> 00:12:49,960
surface.

224
00:12:49,960 --> 00:12:53,470
So it will be a mission that without
accessing directly the ocean would still

225
00:12:53,680 --> 00:12:58,480
might still be able to analyze ocean
materials. It's very exciting mission. Now

226
00:13:00,040 --> 00:13:02,740
there is another exciting place
in the solar system that's titan.

227
00:13:02,980 --> 00:13:07,120
That's a moon of Saturn. Titan is very
interesting because it's very alien.

228
00:13:07,121 --> 00:13:10,540
It's probably the most alien place in
the solar system in the sense that it's

229
00:13:10,541 --> 00:13:14,410
very different from everything else.
It's a moon of a fairly large sizes,

230
00:13:14,411 --> 00:13:16,140
the largest moon of Saturn.
Uh,

231
00:13:16,180 --> 00:13:19,890
but the interesting thing about
titan are these spots on the surface,

232
00:13:19,900 --> 00:13:22,630
mostly in the northern hemisphere
of the moon, which our lakes,

233
00:13:23,110 --> 00:13:25,930
but they're not legs of water,
their legs of hydrocarbon,

234
00:13:26,230 --> 00:13:29,140
they're mostly made off matte
liquid methane, liquid ethane.

235
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:32,830
That's what makes the moon interesting.
An alien at the same time,

236
00:13:32,920 --> 00:13:37,510
it's because there's nothing really,
there is about these days familiar to us.

237
00:13:37,720 --> 00:13:41,200
Liquid methane happens at man,
it's 150 degrees

238
00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:45,910
centigrade. So it's an environment
that we don't really understand,

239
00:13:46,180 --> 00:13:49,570
but there has been models proposed by
scientists on how life could actually

240
00:13:49,571 --> 00:13:53,200
exist in these lakes. It will be
live and like anything we know of,

241
00:13:53,380 --> 00:13:56,470
obviously we can not even imagine the
biochemistry of those forms of life.

242
00:13:56,740 --> 00:13:59,560
It wouldn't be water based,
it could be carbon based,

243
00:13:59,830 --> 00:14:02,350
but it will be a chemistry completely
different from what we're used to.

244
00:14:02,710 --> 00:14:06,760
So it's actually really hard to come up
with ways of searching for evidence of

245
00:14:06,761 --> 00:14:09,760
life. Uh, on Dighton does, you
don't really know where to begin.

246
00:14:10,030 --> 00:14:15,030
But there has been several
missions proposed to go to
titan within the next 15,

247
00:14:15,221 --> 00:14:20,050
20 years. Um, and some of them are
actually being considered as we speak, uh,

248
00:14:20,051 --> 00:14:24,310
by a review panel at Nasa, uh,
for flight in the next, uh, in an,

249
00:14:24,340 --> 00:14:29,200
in an upcoming run missions. So data
is very interesting, very alien.

250
00:14:29,710 --> 00:14:34,000
But my favorite place,
it's actually Enceladus and settle.

251
00:14:34,010 --> 00:14:37,090
This is a tiny moon. Maybe you know of
it because it was in the news recently.

252
00:14:37,091 --> 00:14:39,700
It's been in the news for a while,
but recently it made a big splash.

253
00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:42,520
I'll tell you in a second way
then sell it as a tiny moon.

254
00:14:42,790 --> 00:14:46,750
It's about the diameter between
here and La. It's not a big one. Um,

255
00:14:47,110 --> 00:14:51,980
but it's unique in the sense that he
has this active gazers coming out of the

256
00:14:51,981 --> 00:14:52,371
surface.

257
00:14:52,371 --> 00:14:55,850
This is an actual picture of Enceladus
they can buy the Cassini mission and in

258
00:14:55,851 --> 00:15:00,140
the South Pole of the moon you can see
here that picture center at the South

259
00:15:00,140 --> 00:15:03,200
Pole. There is these features
here, features on the surface.

260
00:15:03,230 --> 00:15:06,860
These are called Tiger stripes.
These are cracks in the ice shelf,

261
00:15:07,220 --> 00:15:09,330
in the shell of the moon.
And through this crux,

262
00:15:09,530 --> 00:15:12,910
there's stuff venting into space
that was discovered by Cassini.

263
00:15:13,130 --> 00:15:17,690
And arbitrary in the Saturn system that
NASA and the European sent together in

264
00:15:17,691 --> 00:15:20,660
the 1923 2003,
uh,

265
00:15:20,840 --> 00:15:25,310
took this has been investigating this
month for the last then in 2015 years.

266
00:15:25,311 --> 00:15:29,990
Now the Cassini is just plunging into
Saturn as we speak to the end of the

267
00:15:29,991 --> 00:15:33,410
mission. But through the lifetime
of the mission, we've been able to,

268
00:15:33,500 --> 00:15:37,280
NASA has been able to fly that spacecraft
through the plumes of Enceladus

269
00:15:37,281 --> 00:15:40,730
multiple times and study the
chemistry of those plumes.

270
00:15:41,050 --> 00:15:45,650
It turns out that those blooms are
made mostly of water. They contain CO2,

271
00:15:45,920 --> 00:15:50,020
methane, ammonia and hydrogen.
This is great for microbes. These,

272
00:15:50,021 --> 00:15:54,710
this candy for some microbes is an energy
source for micro organisms on earth.

273
00:15:55,100 --> 00:15:58,910
On top of that, we know that those
gazers contains salts, sodium,

274
00:15:59,300 --> 00:16:02,960
just very similar to the salts that make
up the ocean of the earth and they also

275
00:16:02,961 --> 00:16:06,650
can contain pain is silica
grains a few nanometers.

276
00:16:06,830 --> 00:16:11,300
Silica is the staff that is made in
hydrothermal vents at the bottom of the

277
00:16:11,301 --> 00:16:12,134
ocean.

278
00:16:13,220 --> 00:16:18,050
And organics seems to be lots of organics,

279
00:16:18,110 --> 00:16:22,460
apt to, at least Cassini detected
at two carbons six organics.

280
00:16:22,730 --> 00:16:26,420
Carbon six a is was the limit
of detection of the instrument.

281
00:16:26,540 --> 00:16:29,690
They couldn't see things bigger than
carbon six for a number of reasons.

282
00:16:29,930 --> 00:16:33,530
So the expectation is that
there are probably more
complex organics in the ocean

283
00:16:33,980 --> 00:16:36,320
and all those samples are
coming into space for free.

284
00:16:37,070 --> 00:16:40,910
And so they're just waiting for us to
send a spacecraft and continue looking at

285
00:16:40,911 --> 00:16:43,340
that chemistry for free.
Maybe not for free,

286
00:16:43,341 --> 00:16:47,120
maybe your hand it hand and $50 billion,
but once we get there,

287
00:16:47,150 --> 00:16:49,820
the samples are for free. So, um,

288
00:16:51,740 --> 00:16:54,140
recently, uh, uh,

289
00:16:54,170 --> 00:16:58,970
our team at Nasa Ames in collaboration
with Goddard space flight center and the,

290
00:16:58,971 --> 00:17:02,070
uh, uh, APL laboratories at
Johns Hopkins University,

291
00:17:02,071 --> 00:17:03,950
we will propose the mission
to do precisely that,

292
00:17:04,190 --> 00:17:08,980
the return to end sellers and search
for evidence of life in the applied

293
00:17:08,981 --> 00:17:12,710
materials coming out of the South Pole.
Now that mission gets selected by NASA,

294
00:17:12,830 --> 00:17:16,580
it's going to make it there somewhere
sometime in the mid twenties, thirties.

295
00:17:17,300 --> 00:17:22,130
Um, I, I expect to be there. Weed
smoking started running. So, um,

296
00:17:23,040 --> 00:17:23,540
uh,

297
00:17:23,540 --> 00:17:26,780
but it's one of those things that shows
you how complicated technological it is.

298
00:17:26,810 --> 00:17:28,730
Missions can be because of the distance,

299
00:17:28,731 --> 00:17:32,360
because of the complexity of the
science in all these type of things.

300
00:17:32,361 --> 00:17:36,200
But in the meantime, we have 25 years to
figure things out. That's the good news.

301
00:17:36,530 --> 00:17:38,720
And so we keep studying the,
uh,

302
00:17:38,750 --> 00:17:42,050
all the data that comes back from Cassini
and that just wanted to share with you

303
00:17:42,260 --> 00:17:46,250
some letters, results of a conceptual
model. We build very simple model,

304
00:17:46,251 --> 00:17:48,890
but they think it's very
important based on Cassini data.

305
00:17:48,891 --> 00:17:52,680
So told you the Cassini detected
hydrogen coming out of the, uh,

306
00:17:52,920 --> 00:17:56,310
of the plume and he also can
a detected silica grains.

307
00:17:56,520 --> 00:18:00,090
The Silica has already been linked to
hydrothermal vents at the bottom of the

308
00:18:00,091 --> 00:18:00,924
end sellers ocean.

309
00:18:01,020 --> 00:18:05,820
So this would be a cross section of the
moon with the ice shelf and the plums in

310
00:18:05,821 --> 00:18:06,930
the southern hemisphere.

311
00:18:07,230 --> 00:18:09,840
We know that there is an ocean based
on the composition of the plumes.

312
00:18:10,110 --> 00:18:13,530
We know that there is hydrothermal
activity at the ocean sediment interface

313
00:18:13,740 --> 00:18:16,930
based on the presence of those
silicon nanoparticles. Um,

314
00:18:17,160 --> 00:18:18,690
now when we take the composition,

315
00:18:18,691 --> 00:18:21,780
that composition that comes out of
Cassini and we put it in the ocean and we

316
00:18:21,781 --> 00:18:25,350
shake it and we run our geo chemical
models, it turns out they're all that gas,

317
00:18:25,351 --> 00:18:26,520
hydrogen and methane there.

318
00:18:26,521 --> 00:18:30,240
It's been detected in the plume has to
be forming here at the bottom of the

319
00:18:30,241 --> 00:18:32,550
ocean. And as quickly,
as soon as it forms,

320
00:18:32,850 --> 00:18:36,660
it's actually starts bubbling because
there is so much guys that it's actually

321
00:18:36,870 --> 00:18:40,170
above the hydrostatic pressure.
And then that guy's forms,

322
00:18:40,171 --> 00:18:42,630
bubbles and those bubbles with
the bubbles. Do they rise?

323
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:47,910
They like to go up and we've been running
some models to estimate how big those

324
00:18:47,911 --> 00:18:51,060
bubbles would, how fast they
would rise, how big they would be.

325
00:18:51,360 --> 00:18:56,340
Turns out it might be enough gas
in there to mix the entire ocean,

326
00:18:56,370 --> 00:18:58,800
which is good for us,
but most importantly,

327
00:18:59,430 --> 00:19:02,220
it's enough stuff to bring
hydrothermal vent fluids.

328
00:19:02,250 --> 00:19:05,790
This is an example of a picture from
the ocean on the earth where you can see

329
00:19:05,791 --> 00:19:09,210
the hydrothermal vents, uh,
pumping fluids into the ocean.

330
00:19:09,690 --> 00:19:14,520
These fluids could go straight up into
the plumes in about timescales of,

331
00:19:14,940 --> 00:19:16,110
uh,
several months.

332
00:19:16,200 --> 00:19:21,200
Earth months just aided by
these rapid raise of bubbles,

333
00:19:21,690 --> 00:19:22,411
which means that we're,

334
00:19:22,411 --> 00:19:26,890
we're sampling in the moon actually has
a significant amount of hydrothermal

335
00:19:26,910 --> 00:19:29,190
material living in there.
Why is that important?

336
00:19:29,220 --> 00:19:32,430
Because we know that there are microbes
on the earth that's like to grow around

337
00:19:32,431 --> 00:19:33,450
these hydrothermal vents.

338
00:19:33,570 --> 00:19:37,170
Also shrimp and other stuff we don't
inspect shrimp on and some others, but,

339
00:19:37,500 --> 00:19:40,290
but the microbes, the microbes would
be enough and they will be fine.

340
00:19:40,500 --> 00:19:43,860
If we have an ecosystem of microbes
developing at the bottom of these

341
00:19:43,861 --> 00:19:48,150
hydrothermal vents using that hydrogen
and methane and CO2 and nutrients to grow

342
00:19:48,151 --> 00:19:52,130
and reproduce some of those microbes,
or at least their decay products,

343
00:19:52,140 --> 00:19:56,500
they could get and trained in
these rising plume come back, uh,

344
00:19:56,640 --> 00:19:58,350
shooting through the,
through the gazers,

345
00:19:58,590 --> 00:20:00,000
I mean through the plumes on the surface.

346
00:20:00,260 --> 00:20:03,840
Now our spacecraft could catch those
microbes or the chemistry associated to

347
00:20:03,841 --> 00:20:05,730
them and maybe find evidence for life.

348
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:11,480
So this is that these gets may five stars
as the most interesting destination in

349
00:20:11,821 --> 00:20:16,770
the solar system. Uh, even vacation
will be interesting there. So, uh,

350
00:20:17,190 --> 00:20:22,190
now the question that brings us at this
point is there is obviously the search

351
00:20:22,651 --> 00:20:24,380
for life. The search for a second, Janice,

352
00:20:24,390 --> 00:20:26,550
I hope that I convince
you that it's timely.

353
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:31,440
We now have plenty of destinations
to go to. Um, and it's real.

354
00:20:31,560 --> 00:20:33,930
It's a, it's a reality. I'm
not saying there is live there,

355
00:20:34,080 --> 00:20:36,990
I'm just saying that all the conditions
we could hope for our med there.

356
00:20:37,170 --> 00:20:41,880
So there is no really a excuse now to
continue investigating. Now the question,

357
00:20:42,120 --> 00:20:45,330
next question is how do we
discover a second genesis of life?

358
00:20:46,500 --> 00:20:49,720
That's what's going take is mostly of
the rest of this, of the talk. Now,

359
00:20:50,790 --> 00:20:51,970
up until recently,

360
00:20:52,390 --> 00:20:57,280
this pretty much what our understanding
of a extra tray. So forms of life, uh,

361
00:20:57,290 --> 00:20:59,440
aliens are typically
defined geographically.

362
00:20:59,980 --> 00:21:04,240
If something is not a part of the planet,
it must be an alien.

363
00:21:04,241 --> 00:21:08,820
Must be a second genesis of life. But
that really, that's not, that's nothing.

364
00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:12,160
That's not a statement. They
scientifically, uh, you,

365
00:21:12,210 --> 00:21:15,860
you can support it with
scientific data just yet. Uh,

366
00:21:16,180 --> 00:21:21,100
there's been plenty of models tossed
around about Panspermia probably you are

367
00:21:21,101 --> 00:21:24,790
familiar with the concept and Panspermia
is the transfer offline between

368
00:21:24,791 --> 00:21:27,970
planetary bodies. There are actually
different flavors of Panspermia.

369
00:21:28,300 --> 00:21:32,530
There has been a, the most unlikely
type of Panspermia you can think of.

370
00:21:32,531 --> 00:21:37,000
It's interstellar panspermia the transfer
of life between distance solar systems.

371
00:21:37,001 --> 00:21:41,160
Now these models, the only reason
they're considered is, is the, uh,

372
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:43,960
because the probabilities are so low.
The only things that make,

373
00:21:44,170 --> 00:21:47,950
the only thing that makes these models
palatable to a scientist is the enormous

374
00:21:48,250 --> 00:21:52,450
time at the university has been around.
And so when you factor in time,

375
00:21:52,720 --> 00:21:56,550
then anything is possible.
Uh, but we're not, uh,

376
00:21:57,370 --> 00:22:00,810
Panspermia fans are not really a
cleansing their hubs on these interstellar

377
00:22:00,820 --> 00:22:04,720
Panspermia. There Mosley thinking on two
different types of more local panspermia

378
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:07,520
commentary.
Panspermia Planetary Uplink Twinsburg Mia.

379
00:22:07,630 --> 00:22:10,340
The first one commentary is the idea that,
uh,

380
00:22:10,450 --> 00:22:13,390
our solar system didn't
come out of nowhere. Uh,

381
00:22:13,391 --> 00:22:17,440
our son him from the um,
um,

382
00:22:18,790 --> 00:22:22,930
accumulation of gas that resulted from
the explosion of a previous sun as far as

383
00:22:22,931 --> 00:22:26,230
we know it now probably that sign also
had planets based on what we know about

384
00:22:26,231 --> 00:22:27,220
sons in the universe.

385
00:22:27,580 --> 00:22:31,720
People have proposed that if life evolved
on that previous solar system or any

386
00:22:31,721 --> 00:22:35,440
of the previous solar systems that
existed before our own in the same spot in

387
00:22:35,441 --> 00:22:36,180
the universe,

388
00:22:36,180 --> 00:22:39,850
and those forms of life could have been
a hanging around while the planets were

389
00:22:39,851 --> 00:22:43,390
forming and then come back to
colonize the right planets back again.

390
00:22:43,420 --> 00:22:47,740
That's commentary Panspermia
at some people have postulated
that the universe is

391
00:22:47,741 --> 00:22:52,490
actually percolating with.
It's very curated with uh, uh,

392
00:22:52,540 --> 00:22:54,340
materials that contain,

393
00:22:55,100 --> 00:22:57,820
contain forms of life preserved in them.

394
00:22:57,820 --> 00:23:00,830
And that could be sitting the
universe throughout. Now you can, the,

395
00:23:01,470 --> 00:23:03,790
the interesting thing about
Panspermia is it might deliver or not.

396
00:23:03,820 --> 00:23:08,320
It doesn't matter. Believe he's
not a scientific, a valid approach.

397
00:23:08,980 --> 00:23:12,460
There is nothing that that
suggests that this theory is wrong.

398
00:23:12,850 --> 00:23:13,683
And that goes at the,

399
00:23:14,010 --> 00:23:17,560
that goes to the core of the problem of
how we search for a second genesis of

400
00:23:17,561 --> 00:23:19,990
life and why we need to search
for a second genesis of life.

401
00:23:20,830 --> 00:23:23,730
The last one is the one you know
probably you're more familiar with its

402
00:23:23,740 --> 00:23:27,550
planetary Prince Permian is the concept
that planets after they formed in the

403
00:23:27,551 --> 00:23:28,121
solar system,

404
00:23:28,121 --> 00:23:33,121
they've been literally exchanging
spit a back and forth early on.

405
00:23:33,280 --> 00:23:37,540
They were younger, they were more
uh, okay, I'm now going to go there.

406
00:23:37,541 --> 00:23:41,620
But there was a lot of exchange going
on early on in the history of the solar

407
00:23:41,621 --> 00:23:43,900
system. It's plenty of
meteorites from Mars and earth.

408
00:23:44,170 --> 00:23:46,400
There is mere rides from Earth on Mars.

409
00:23:46,820 --> 00:23:50,750
People have actually estimated the
probability given a number of factors of

410
00:23:50,751 --> 00:23:54,590
lives transferring between planets
starting on Earth Ground Zero.

411
00:23:55,040 --> 00:23:59,060
Even that 13% chances than biological
material could be actually successfully

412
00:23:59,061 --> 00:23:59,960
transferred to Venus.

413
00:24:00,350 --> 00:24:04,700
Not An small chance of lives transformed
tomorrow's back and forth. Actually,

414
00:24:04,701 --> 00:24:08,030
if people have postulated an origin of
level Mars and later transferred to Earth

415
00:24:08,360 --> 00:24:10,310
based on the number of
Joe Chemical prisons,

416
00:24:10,520 --> 00:24:14,810
even places like Europe and then sell
this, there is a, there is more but still,

417
00:24:15,440 --> 00:24:18,110
uh, existing probability that life
could be transferred between them.

418
00:24:18,111 --> 00:24:23,111
So the bottom line of this is that
you cannot assume that aliens can be

419
00:24:23,421 --> 00:24:25,700
geographically defined.

420
00:24:26,060 --> 00:24:30,500
Geographics then apply to aliens and
Liz and less we know unless we find a

421
00:24:30,501 --> 00:24:34,670
second example of flavor can we can
use to prove it. So these, uh, review,

422
00:24:34,700 --> 00:24:37,220
this needs to revision.
We need to update our concept,

423
00:24:37,221 --> 00:24:40,520
how we treat aliens in
many different ways.

424
00:24:42,200 --> 00:24:43,033
Um,

425
00:24:44,330 --> 00:24:49,220
and so the question then comes,
so how do we search for a second genesis?

426
00:24:49,250 --> 00:24:54,050
If we can just go find life somewhere
else and claim second geneses then how do

427
00:24:54,051 --> 00:24:54,884
we search for it?

428
00:24:55,310 --> 00:24:59,780
And I'm going to go through as through
a short thought process that I'm

429
00:24:59,840 --> 00:25:02,750
hopefully exemplifies the
way we've been doing this.

430
00:25:02,751 --> 00:25:05,810
We've been going about this business
for the NAM a number of decades now.

431
00:25:05,870 --> 00:25:08,560
Certain flight, but I'm gonna
use a different example. So they,

432
00:25:08,580 --> 00:25:13,580
this picture of the universe and we know
now that there are more planets than

433
00:25:14,211 --> 00:25:17,390
stars in the galaxy and there
is plenty of galaxies out there.

434
00:25:17,391 --> 00:25:19,820
So there is a large number
of planets out there.

435
00:25:19,821 --> 00:25:23,270
And now think for a second that
earth is the only planet we know.

436
00:25:23,330 --> 00:25:26,450
There's no other planet in the solar
system. Earth is now a number one.

437
00:25:26,600 --> 00:25:30,380
Everything we know our planets
is captured in the earth.

438
00:25:31,070 --> 00:25:34,550
And uh, we decided to search
for other planets out there.

439
00:25:34,790 --> 00:25:36,590
Are there other planets
other than the earth?

440
00:25:36,860 --> 00:25:40,190
We could devise an experiment
where we take our planet,

441
00:25:40,340 --> 00:25:44,780
we look at the way it's made, the way
it's built, the composition, the shape,

442
00:25:44,781 --> 00:25:45,710
the size and everything.

443
00:25:45,980 --> 00:25:49,400
And we can define a series of what
we would call planet signatures.

444
00:25:49,940 --> 00:25:51,020
And then we could go,
we could,

445
00:25:51,530 --> 00:25:56,210
we could build a telescope and started
searching for planets out there based on

446
00:25:56,211 --> 00:25:58,910
the presence or absence of
those planets signatures.

447
00:25:59,150 --> 00:26:01,970
We could try to search for
direct imaging morphology.

448
00:26:02,030 --> 00:26:05,960
If we see something that moves, started
the move, if something moves a wonder,

449
00:26:06,110 --> 00:26:08,660
there should be a planet we could,
we could look for that.

450
00:26:08,661 --> 00:26:11,510
We could look for a motion,
we could look for unique compositions.

451
00:26:11,720 --> 00:26:13,910
We know that the atmosphere
of the earth is very unique.

452
00:26:13,911 --> 00:26:18,530
It's very unlikely to exist
somewhere else, uh, especially,

453
00:26:18,730 --> 00:26:21,800
uh,
in places like stars or rock stars.

454
00:26:21,830 --> 00:26:24,680
And so if we see an anomaly of
nitrogen and oxygen, for example,

455
00:26:24,681 --> 00:26:26,660
we could claim that there
is a planet out there.

456
00:26:27,350 --> 00:26:31,100
Now you can guess this is not a very
efficient way of looking at planets.

457
00:26:31,101 --> 00:26:32,900
And in fact,
that's not how we look at planets.

458
00:26:33,350 --> 00:26:37,070
The way we look at planets around
other stars is by a number of methods.

459
00:26:37,071 --> 00:26:42,071
But mostly they're focused on looking
at a star and looking for anomalies in

460
00:26:42,621 --> 00:26:47,400
what we know about that star. In this
case, the anomalies represented as a law,

461
00:26:47,490 --> 00:26:49,920
as a decree,
as a decline in brightness.

462
00:26:50,160 --> 00:26:54,240
So here we have a spectrum of
the brightness of the star.

463
00:26:54,270 --> 00:26:57,930
In this case is actually, I think this
is Venus going around our own son.

464
00:26:58,350 --> 00:27:00,360
The same applies to other planets.

465
00:27:00,660 --> 00:27:03,840
And we see how when the planet
crosses in front of the star,

466
00:27:03,870 --> 00:27:06,090
the brains of the star of the
quizzes in a predictable way.

467
00:27:06,240 --> 00:27:09,960
Now obviously this is not what we see
when we look at exoplanets is what we see

468
00:27:09,961 --> 00:27:12,510
when we look at exoplanets,
we actually see the planet.

469
00:27:12,990 --> 00:27:17,460
Bottom line is we don't need to look for
planets in order to search for planets.

470
00:27:18,090 --> 00:27:19,980
We don't need to look
for planets signatures.

471
00:27:20,200 --> 00:27:23,970
What we need to do is we need to focus on
something that we understand very well,

472
00:27:24,120 --> 00:27:27,540
whose physical laws are very well
understood and see if there is any,

473
00:27:27,780 --> 00:27:31,800
anything in those in the behavior of
that object that doesn't come that cannot

474
00:27:31,801 --> 00:27:34,830
be explained by what
we know about physics.

475
00:27:35,430 --> 00:27:38,100
There's in fact the way we search
for planets, maybe not consciously,

476
00:27:38,280 --> 00:27:40,860
but it's a very robust way of looking
for planets because you're not

477
00:27:40,861 --> 00:27:43,890
presupposing anything about
those planets evolve. Evolve.

478
00:27:43,900 --> 00:27:46,410
When Neil was that planets
are made of oxygen,

479
00:27:46,500 --> 00:27:49,830
have an atmosphere of oxygen and nitrogen
and that they are the size of the

480
00:27:49,831 --> 00:27:52,320
earth.
They look blue and that's all we look for.

481
00:27:52,440 --> 00:27:55,770
We'd still be looking for planets today
and we will put in there, found anyone,

482
00:27:56,350 --> 00:28:00,780
uh, we need to be able to search for
planets with, are looking for planets.

483
00:28:01,680 --> 00:28:03,810
This covering planets without
searching for planets.

484
00:28:04,200 --> 00:28:07,950
Now that's not how we've been searching
for life despite we also start with the

485
00:28:07,980 --> 00:28:12,390
data number of one. What we do,
people normally scientists do,

486
00:28:12,540 --> 00:28:16,950
they come up with biosignatures instead
of planet signatures and then they start

487
00:28:16,951 --> 00:28:19,350
searching for those
biosignatures in other planets.

488
00:28:19,650 --> 00:28:22,890
And that just makes the same sense.
It's looking for planets, signatures,

489
00:28:22,891 --> 00:28:26,790
in my opinion, when your database,
all your data is based on one,

490
00:28:27,120 --> 00:28:32,120
any see any signature you look for a
is suspect of what we call confirmation

491
00:28:32,671 --> 00:28:34,350
bias.
You're not searching for something,

492
00:28:34,500 --> 00:28:36,120
you're confirming that something is there.

493
00:28:36,270 --> 00:28:39,330
You assume there is something there
that has these in these properties.

494
00:28:39,480 --> 00:28:41,580
You just want to confirm your assumptions.
Now,

495
00:28:41,581 --> 00:28:43,260
this is not something we do on purpose,

496
00:28:43,620 --> 00:28:45,990
but it's something that
it's underlying every, uh,

497
00:28:46,080 --> 00:28:50,370
every effort to search for life out there
and that I think it's a big important

498
00:28:50,371 --> 00:28:54,780
problem. So the question is, no, it's not.

499
00:28:54,781 --> 00:28:56,850
How do we discover a
second genesis of life?

500
00:28:57,110 --> 00:28:59,760
The question is how the whiskey cover a
second genesis of life without searching

501
00:28:59,761 --> 00:29:03,900
for life. And that's an interesting
question. How do you go about this?

502
00:29:03,901 --> 00:29:04,651
Can we have,

503
00:29:04,651 --> 00:29:08,040
can we find a way to search for live
the same way we search for exoplanets?

504
00:29:09,990 --> 00:29:13,500
And so to do that we actually have to go
back and obviously look at what we know

505
00:29:13,530 --> 00:29:16,410
and what we know is live on earth. This
is probably, you're familiar with it,

506
00:29:16,411 --> 00:29:19,500
that just a representation of the
tree of life there is simplified.

507
00:29:19,740 --> 00:29:24,630
But this covers our family tree
for the last 4 billion years.

508
00:29:25,380 --> 00:29:28,190
Uh,
we are up here now at the tip of the Oak.

509
00:29:28,200 --> 00:29:33,060
Harriet's a team is not something
[inaudible] in evolutionary biology.

510
00:29:33,090 --> 00:29:35,010
This could be a dead end for us.

511
00:29:35,130 --> 00:29:37,740
The fact that we are up in the branches
doesn't mean that we're better or worse.

512
00:29:37,740 --> 00:29:41,010
It just means that we're
up in the brunches. Um, uh,

513
00:29:41,240 --> 00:29:44,830
would we know of based on
these organization of the
tree that there is a lot of

514
00:29:44,831 --> 00:29:48,640
interesting and useful information we
can learn about life on earth and we can

515
00:29:48,641 --> 00:29:52,980
extract some that, some of
that information, uh, in, uh,

516
00:29:53,120 --> 00:29:56,920
and apply it to strategy search for life
somewhere else. So we know for example,

517
00:29:56,921 --> 00:29:58,120
and we'll talk about these in a second,

518
00:29:58,121 --> 00:30:00,730
that all the major groups of
life on earth, the bacteria,

519
00:30:00,731 --> 00:30:04,270
the archaea and they will carry it.
These two are small unicellular organisms,

520
00:30:04,271 --> 00:30:05,530
all of them,
the precarious,

521
00:30:06,070 --> 00:30:11,070
we all come from the same last universal
common ancestor called the looker down

522
00:30:11,141 --> 00:30:15,010
here. Last universal common ancestor.
We all branched out of the same one,

523
00:30:15,130 --> 00:30:18,250
the same successful one,
but this was not the origin of life.

524
00:30:18,640 --> 00:30:22,360
The origin of life on earth happened
somewhere here with what we call the

525
00:30:22,660 --> 00:30:25,490
organism or the original organism.
Uh,

526
00:30:25,510 --> 00:30:29,210
that was our founding organism.
Um,

527
00:30:29,860 --> 00:30:31,480
and there was a period we know,

528
00:30:31,540 --> 00:30:35,890
or there must have been a period we know
of intense evolution between the origin

529
00:30:35,891 --> 00:30:39,400
of life and loca where there's was
a lot of biochemistry going on,

530
00:30:39,700 --> 00:30:42,100
a lot of trial. And
error. A lot of mutations,

531
00:30:42,101 --> 00:30:44,320
a lot of organisms trying
to figure things out.

532
00:30:44,680 --> 00:30:46,900
Even there could have
been things branching out.

533
00:30:46,930 --> 00:30:50,350
The disappeared eventually because they
weren't successful enough or there were

534
00:30:50,360 --> 00:30:54,770
infinity enough and there is
no record of those anymore. Uh,

535
00:30:54,820 --> 00:30:59,820
we'll go back to this issue of how far
into these periods we can look at in a

536
00:31:00,820 --> 00:31:01,720
few seconds because that's important.

537
00:31:02,890 --> 00:31:07,890
But we can take this basic structure
of life on earth and we could just do a

538
00:31:08,321 --> 00:31:11,350
quick thought,
a thought exercise on what possibles,

539
00:31:11,590 --> 00:31:13,960
what possibilities are out there
in terms of a second genesis,

540
00:31:13,990 --> 00:31:15,940
how would a second,
Janice is related to these,

541
00:31:16,300 --> 00:31:18,820
obviously what we mean
essentially by a second.

542
00:31:18,820 --> 00:31:22,150
Genesis is a form of life that
is not related to these guys.

543
00:31:22,840 --> 00:31:26,270
That's what we mean by a second.
Genesis, no more, no less. Uh,

544
00:31:26,320 --> 00:31:29,170
we're not assigning locality to a second.
Genesis.

545
00:31:29,171 --> 00:31:32,560
There could have been a second genesis
on earth for as far as far as we know,

546
00:31:32,561 --> 00:31:35,440
when people have postulated, uh, uh,

547
00:31:35,470 --> 00:31:39,310
second geneses at a second biosphere on
the earth lurking in the shadows that

548
00:31:39,311 --> 00:31:42,590
biochemical is independent from us
now has never been found. But it did.

549
00:31:42,591 --> 00:31:44,380
Interesting idea.
Uh,

550
00:31:44,650 --> 00:31:49,250
we're looking for a second
genesis something and related
to us or regionally. Uh,

551
00:31:49,540 --> 00:31:53,830
but we can constrain this space of
what's possible we can possibly find out

552
00:31:53,831 --> 00:31:56,800
there just by making
some basic assumptions.

553
00:31:56,801 --> 00:32:00,640
So essentially that's goes back to our
original idea. There is a prebiotic world.

554
00:32:00,790 --> 00:32:01,623
There is no life.

555
00:32:02,290 --> 00:32:06,070
An origin of life event happens on
our planet that led to interesting

556
00:32:06,071 --> 00:32:10,340
biochemistry, the RNA world and
whatnot. And eventually, uh,

557
00:32:10,840 --> 00:32:13,780
the mother and organisms
branching out until today. Now,

558
00:32:13,781 --> 00:32:17,620
if we go to Mars and we find a form of
life and we can do all the chemistry,

559
00:32:17,621 --> 00:32:20,080
we don't, we do two living organisms, uh,

560
00:32:20,120 --> 00:32:22,450
and it turns out that we can
map these organisms back.

561
00:32:22,840 --> 00:32:23,980
That's what it's gonna look like.

562
00:32:24,010 --> 00:32:25,870
It's going to map somewhere
in our tree of life.

563
00:32:25,930 --> 00:32:27,220
It's not going to be a second genesis.

564
00:32:27,250 --> 00:32:31,720
That's one possibility that life out
there actually shares a common ancestry.

565
00:32:31,810 --> 00:32:34,940
We will be able, we might
be able to look to, to uh,

566
00:32:35,410 --> 00:32:40,070
to establish that second possibilities.
What I see I call a close second geneses.

567
00:32:40,310 --> 00:32:44,210
That would be an example of a form of
life that is independent from us in origin

568
00:32:44,211 --> 00:32:49,211
but it came out of the same kind of soup
organic soup and we'll talk about a in

569
00:32:49,351 --> 00:32:54,260
a few slides of what we mean by the same
kind of soup or we could talk about a

570
00:32:54,261 --> 00:32:58,070
distance second genesis and there will
be a form of life completely unrelated to

571
00:32:58,071 --> 00:32:59,090
us coming out of uh,

572
00:32:59,840 --> 00:33:04,340
coming out of a very different type of
probiotic soup that we couldn't even

573
00:33:04,341 --> 00:33:05,174
begin to imagine.

574
00:33:05,180 --> 00:33:08,360
Although actually you might think of a
couple of split one plays in the solar

575
00:33:08,361 --> 00:33:09,410
system where that might happen.

576
00:33:10,010 --> 00:33:15,010
So here's what I propose as the solution
to how to come out of this conundrum.

577
00:33:15,590 --> 00:33:20,270
How can we establish whether some plays
in the solar system contains a common

578
00:33:20,271 --> 00:33:24,230
ancestor or a close second geneses
or a distant second genesis.

579
00:33:24,500 --> 00:33:29,500
It goes back to something we are familiar
with since the 1930s the theory of

580
00:33:29,661 --> 00:33:34,661
organic chemical evolution you may be
familiar with with this theory of your

581
00:33:35,150 --> 00:33:36,440
read about the origin of life.

582
00:33:36,800 --> 00:33:40,280
That's the theory that debunks the idea
that life is a spontaneous generation.

583
00:33:40,560 --> 00:33:43,850
It live instead propose
that life is just another,

584
00:33:44,130 --> 00:33:47,540
it's a continuum in the process of organic
chemical evolution in the universe.

585
00:33:48,020 --> 00:33:49,250
It's a very interesting theory.

586
00:33:49,400 --> 00:33:53,510
It's in fact the theory means that
it's supported by a lot of evidence.

587
00:33:53,511 --> 00:33:57,440
It's right now is the most successful
explanation of how chemistry happens in

588
00:33:57,441 --> 00:34:01,340
the universe, all the way
to uh, thinking organisms.

589
00:34:02,870 --> 00:34:06,890
Now, there are four tenants. The
theory of organic chemical evolution.

590
00:34:07,430 --> 00:34:11,690
The first one is that there is chemistry
going on in the universe with or

591
00:34:11,691 --> 00:34:15,390
without the presence of life that results
in the synthesis of organic or small

592
00:34:15,391 --> 00:34:18,380
organic molecules like
amino acids and nucleotides.

593
00:34:18,590 --> 00:34:22,130
These are molecules we're familiar with
because those are parts of our, what?

594
00:34:22,160 --> 00:34:24,650
Biochemistry, but they're
done. It's not live.

595
00:34:24,651 --> 00:34:26,600
It's not required for
amino acids to exist.

596
00:34:27,860 --> 00:34:31,700
The second tenant is that
they are a combination of
these small molecules forms,

597
00:34:31,790 --> 00:34:33,710
larger molecules called polymers.

598
00:34:34,280 --> 00:34:38,330
And that can happen again with
or without the presence of life.

599
00:34:39,260 --> 00:34:41,930
Now in the case of at least
one planet in the universe,

600
00:34:42,170 --> 00:34:46,040
the combination of those polymers
eventually resulted in small droplets,

601
00:34:46,070 --> 00:34:49,610
self organized droplets that we call
protopia loans that will be the first

602
00:34:49,611 --> 00:34:51,820
organisms.
And uh,

603
00:34:53,090 --> 00:34:56,720
fueled by the process of evolution
by natural selection. Darwin,

604
00:34:56,960 --> 00:35:01,730
those pro a pro by owns, uh,
became more and more complex,

605
00:35:01,940 --> 00:35:05,390
eventually figured out how to
transfer information between different

606
00:35:06,920 --> 00:35:07,753
organisms.

607
00:35:07,970 --> 00:35:12,170
And that just cascaded
into a huge complexity.

608
00:35:13,070 --> 00:35:14,450
It's still chemical complexity.

609
00:35:14,870 --> 00:35:18,260
The bottom line of the fury of organic
chemical addition is that these are steps

610
00:35:18,261 --> 00:35:20,810
that just [inaudible] off one from
the other. We'd done, we'd done,

611
00:35:20,870 --> 00:35:22,880
we cannot separate them.
We don't need to separate them.

612
00:35:23,120 --> 00:35:27,590
We can separate evolution by natural
selection from the origin of life,

613
00:35:27,650 --> 00:35:30,740
from prebiotic evolution,
from basic prebiotic chemistry.

614
00:35:30,860 --> 00:35:35,060
It's all part of the same continuum. And
because it's part of the same continuum,

615
00:35:35,270 --> 00:35:38,700
this should be fairly frequent
in the universe. It's,

616
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:42,990
there's nothing here that it's earth lead
it related at please not as far as we

617
00:35:42,991 --> 00:35:44,640
know,
unique to the earth.

618
00:35:46,980 --> 00:35:50,490
So here's a representation of the
same idea in the case of the earth.

619
00:35:50,550 --> 00:35:54,870
So here you have the four stages in the,
in their organic chemical evolution.

620
00:35:55,350 --> 00:35:58,540
We start with the NAB, with the Solar
Nebula, the beginning of the uh,

621
00:35:58,800 --> 00:36:01,290
the better beginning of the solar system.
We know that there were compounds,

622
00:36:01,291 --> 00:36:06,180
very basic molecules like water,
uh, ammonia, methane, [inaudible].

623
00:36:06,210 --> 00:36:09,100
That stuff is all over the universe.
Uh, it was probably president,

624
00:36:09,130 --> 00:36:12,390
our Nebula when the
planets, sorry, the form,

625
00:36:12,600 --> 00:36:16,320
you have room for more complex
chemistry, uh, that uh,

626
00:36:16,650 --> 00:36:20,670
these molecules react and they generate
other basic molecules like amino acids.

627
00:36:20,710 --> 00:36:23,790
Nucleotides were not.
Eventually when the planet calls down,

628
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:26,430
these things can grow into
larger more complex molecules.

629
00:36:26,431 --> 00:36:30,150
Think of it as a process of
crystallization. The same way as lava,

630
00:36:30,480 --> 00:36:33,840
a hot Floyd where everything is
mixed and everything is, is chaotic.

631
00:36:34,140 --> 00:36:36,960
When it starts to call, call
down, it starts to crystallize.

632
00:36:36,961 --> 00:36:39,690
And then you have big structures
for me. Hub, you can think of this.

633
00:36:39,691 --> 00:36:44,070
Chemistry in a similar way eventually
starts to crystallize into complex forms.

634
00:36:44,370 --> 00:36:46,530
Now there is a singular event,

635
00:36:46,650 --> 00:36:50,790
the origin of life on earth where
these things moved from free,

636
00:36:51,360 --> 00:36:55,980
floating a complex molecules into
something very complicated membranes,

637
00:36:55,981 --> 00:36:57,540
proteins,
uh,

638
00:36:57,720 --> 00:37:00,900
genetic material that eventually evolved
through the process of their reading

639
00:37:00,901 --> 00:37:03,750
and evolution into very complex
organisms up until today.

640
00:37:04,410 --> 00:37:07,650
But it's all part of the same
continuum of increasing complexity.

641
00:37:12,450 --> 00:37:15,520
Now, why is that important? While there
is plenty of evidence of that, uh,

642
00:37:15,630 --> 00:37:18,960
these are amino acids, sugars,
lipids, and nuclear basis.

643
00:37:18,990 --> 00:37:21,870
These are the four basic
ingredients of our biochemistry.

644
00:37:22,080 --> 00:37:26,790
Any biochemistry on earth is based on
those four types of basic comp compounds.

645
00:37:27,180 --> 00:37:31,690
And this is examples of those
compounds. We find a mirror rates, um,

646
00:37:32,400 --> 00:37:33,233
all four of them.

647
00:37:33,330 --> 00:37:36,780
This is the list of amino acids that
have been identified in meteorites so far

648
00:37:37,050 --> 00:37:41,230
that and that they're known
to be non-terrestrial. Uh,

649
00:37:41,250 --> 00:37:42,690
you can read all of them here,

650
00:37:42,691 --> 00:37:47,450
but about half of the immuno acids we
used to from our proteins are in these

651
00:37:47,451 --> 00:37:51,330
table and they're not biogenic.
The same with sugars.

652
00:37:51,360 --> 00:37:54,760
We tend to use this type of sugars here.
There is plenty of sugars and mid rates.

653
00:37:55,050 --> 00:38:00,050
These are tiny cell like structures that
are formed when you put some meter aids

654
00:38:01,070 --> 00:38:04,260
in water.
Those meteorites have molecules,

655
00:38:04,261 --> 00:38:08,160
lipid fat like molecules that when they
put them in water and you dissolve the

656
00:38:08,161 --> 00:38:08,790
media raid,

657
00:38:08,790 --> 00:38:12,820
they actually form these satellite like
structures which have some resemblances

658
00:38:12,850 --> 00:38:17,400
in many different ways to our own cells
and these are the nucleobases that form

659
00:38:17,401 --> 00:38:22,401
our DNA and RNA or DNA and RNA
are made a free basic molecules.

660
00:38:22,531 --> 00:38:26,850
One of them or the nuclear basis, and
these are the clubs is find in meteorites.

661
00:38:27,690 --> 00:38:32,040
Now you can see it here. Limpets they're
finding live. They're finding me rides.

662
00:38:32,100 --> 00:38:36,160
They useful for membranes, sugars. Again,
they're life. They're finding me right,

663
00:38:36,170 --> 00:38:39,760
so you should useful for energy.
When we don't see meteorites are polymers,

664
00:38:39,820 --> 00:38:44,290
large sugars. That's the stuff of life.
We make large stuff. We make big stuff.

665
00:38:44,940 --> 00:38:48,340
A meter rides don't the same with amino
acids. They're finding meteorites,

666
00:38:48,580 --> 00:38:51,970
but we don't have proteins or bay
complex polymers of amino acids to rides.

667
00:38:52,330 --> 00:38:53,410
And the same with nuclear basis.

668
00:38:53,411 --> 00:38:57,190
You don't see it here because
I'm a in front of it. But um,

669
00:38:57,250 --> 00:38:59,940
there are nucleobases as I
just showed you in meteorites,

670
00:39:00,220 --> 00:39:03,370
but there are not big polymers
of nucleobases. Oh, it's
down there. There you go.

671
00:39:04,830 --> 00:39:05,663
Yeah.

672
00:39:05,880 --> 00:39:06,713
Now

673
00:39:08,760 --> 00:39:13,760
it's very important that that realization
that our chemistry is just the basic

674
00:39:14,251 --> 00:39:17,130
evolution, all of organic chemistry
in the Universal Chemistry.

675
00:39:17,131 --> 00:39:17,761
It's very important.

676
00:39:17,761 --> 00:39:21,810
I tried to summarize the importance of
it in this diagram and I'll try to walk

677
00:39:21,811 --> 00:39:25,170
you through that. Um, we have,

678
00:39:25,440 --> 00:39:28,860
we know there is prebiotic chemistry.
I just showed it to you with pictures,

679
00:39:28,861 --> 00:39:32,250
actual pictures from the early solar
system that we had a spacecraft they can

680
00:39:32,251 --> 00:39:34,620
pictures down there and we
know that there was a Nebula,

681
00:39:34,621 --> 00:39:37,710
they're full of chemicals. There was no
spacecraft at the early solar system,

682
00:39:38,840 --> 00:39:41,010
this closure. But anyway, uh,

683
00:39:41,011 --> 00:39:44,730
we know that there was prebiotic chemistry
from which live on earth originated

684
00:39:44,880 --> 00:39:45,780
at the origin of life.

685
00:39:45,781 --> 00:39:50,781
And evolved into complex multicell
organisms based on the abundance of those

686
00:39:51,001 --> 00:39:52,740
same compounds in the solar,

687
00:39:52,741 --> 00:39:56,610
in solar system materials we could
expect that live on Mars with probably

688
00:39:56,611 --> 00:40:00,780
originate from a similar soup of compounds
and they're very similar conditions

689
00:40:00,781 --> 00:40:05,781
and by similar conditions I mean
water chemistry under 10 temperature,

690
00:40:06,331 --> 00:40:09,990
Ph and solidity similar to
any environment on the earth.

691
00:40:10,800 --> 00:40:13,230
And so I would call,

692
00:40:14,100 --> 00:40:14,590
yeah,

693
00:40:14,590 --> 00:40:18,220
live on Mars if he'd ever existed a close
second geneses because it's probably

694
00:40:18,221 --> 00:40:20,560
evolving from the same
kind of starting materials,

695
00:40:20,650 --> 00:40:22,570
not too far off to think that way.

696
00:40:23,140 --> 00:40:26,670
I would actually go as far as to say
that live on your opine and sellers would

697
00:40:26,740 --> 00:40:30,400
probably also trays back if it
turns out they exist and we started,

698
00:40:30,401 --> 00:40:32,560
we can study their biochemistry,
we can also,

699
00:40:32,620 --> 00:40:35,860
we can probably trace back their
biochemistry to these prebiotic soup,

700
00:40:36,190 --> 00:40:40,480
the same starting materials because
the same basic ingredients were used to

701
00:40:40,481 --> 00:40:41,890
build those,
those roles.

702
00:40:42,670 --> 00:40:45,280
Now there is room for transfer
of flight between planets.

703
00:40:45,281 --> 00:40:47,410
I just told you about Panspermia
so we can always have,

704
00:40:47,650 --> 00:40:49,960
we always have to leave these up,
these possibility open,

705
00:40:50,500 --> 00:40:54,400
but any of those three planets is
sufficiently similar to the earth that we

706
00:40:54,401 --> 00:40:59,270
could postulate the presence in them
have a close second genesis of life. Um,

707
00:40:59,710 --> 00:41:03,910
whereas Dayton, you can think of
Titan as it plays that if he has life,

708
00:41:04,090 --> 00:41:06,730
it should be a very
different chemistry from us.

709
00:41:06,760 --> 00:41:08,620
It probably started with
very similar materials,

710
00:41:08,621 --> 00:41:13,300
but they quickly enable any process
of organic chemical evolution in very

711
00:41:13,301 --> 00:41:16,690
quickly probably led to something very
different from what we know and if it was

712
00:41:16,691 --> 00:41:20,410
life, which tends to speed up
this process of complexity,

713
00:41:20,710 --> 00:41:21,760
then whatever we have there,

714
00:41:21,761 --> 00:41:24,630
it's something that we can not
really comprehend it until we see it.

715
00:41:25,510 --> 00:41:28,390
So I called that as a list
and second genesis of life.

716
00:41:30,910 --> 00:41:31,743
Okay,

717
00:41:32,110 --> 00:41:33,620
now that, why that, why is that important?

718
00:41:33,621 --> 00:41:36,530
Because that's chemistry we can play with.
If you tell me that live on Mars,

719
00:41:36,560 --> 00:41:39,350
probably it was a close second geneses
and he makes sense to think that way.

720
00:41:39,620 --> 00:41:41,240
I know how to distinguish.

721
00:41:41,390 --> 00:41:44,870
I know how to tell whether there
was life there at some point or not.

722
00:41:44,970 --> 00:41:47,510
I'll try to convince you of that in a
second. I think we're running out of time,

723
00:41:47,511 --> 00:41:48,710
right?
Um,

724
00:41:49,070 --> 00:41:53,230
what I say is that because we
really tend to be scientist,

725
00:41:53,720 --> 00:41:56,420
guess what,
we tend to be over optimistic.

726
00:41:56,660 --> 00:42:00,320
We always tend to assume that there
was life on Mars. And so again,

727
00:42:00,321 --> 00:42:03,230
we go back to the confirmation bias.
All we would have to do is to confirm it.

728
00:42:03,440 --> 00:42:08,330
That's why we think about searching
for cells or movement or a crawling.

729
00:42:08,331 --> 00:42:11,990
Reptiles are growing plants or things
like this. Our signatures. In fact,

730
00:42:11,991 --> 00:42:16,490
what we should do is what I propose
these two fold I policies, uh,

731
00:42:16,491 --> 00:42:20,180
that puts yourself in the worst case
scenario to address this fundamental

732
00:42:20,181 --> 00:42:20,690
question.

733
00:42:20,690 --> 00:42:24,170
The question is not whether there is
life on Mars and syllabus or Europa.

734
00:42:24,350 --> 00:42:29,150
The question is how far the organic
chemical evolution go in those planets?

735
00:42:29,240 --> 00:42:32,150
How far there you go. They go as far
as the earth, probably not. Otherwise.

736
00:42:32,151 --> 00:42:35,000
There will be somebody giving a talk
about this or Mars looking back at the

737
00:42:35,001 --> 00:42:36,020
earth.
Uh,

738
00:42:36,050 --> 00:42:39,500
but you don't know in the spectrum of
organic chemical evolution how far it

739
00:42:39,501 --> 00:42:40,040
could have gone.

740
00:42:40,040 --> 00:42:42,440
Maybe it stopped at the prebiotic
chemistry and that's all we see,

741
00:42:42,950 --> 00:42:43,880
but in any case,

742
00:42:44,450 --> 00:42:47,840
that's the question we need to ask and
these are the two hypotheses we need to

743
00:42:47,841 --> 00:42:50,420
falsify. Falsifying is a very
important thing in science.

744
00:42:50,421 --> 00:42:52,580
We need to prove these
two things to be wrong.

745
00:42:53,330 --> 00:42:56,450
The first one is that is the a [inaudible]
signal hypothesis and that means that

746
00:42:56,940 --> 00:42:58,820
organic chemical evolution on Mars,

747
00:42:58,880 --> 00:43:03,050
Europa or Enceladus never went beyond
the prebiotic chemistry and all the

748
00:43:03,051 --> 00:43:07,520
chemistry we will see there is consistent
with robotic sources. The second one,

749
00:43:07,700 --> 00:43:10,670
if we can falsify that one,
if we can go to any of these places,

750
00:43:11,030 --> 00:43:15,590
run our organic chemistry kits and we
figured out that we cannot explain that

751
00:43:15,591 --> 00:43:19,790
chemistry based on everything we know
about a body chemistry than something else

752
00:43:19,830 --> 00:43:23,990
must explain it. That's something
else I propose these earth life,

753
00:43:24,500 --> 00:43:27,950
it's either because of the process of
Panspermia or because of contamination,

754
00:43:28,100 --> 00:43:30,710
planetary protection,
the stuff we brought with us there.

755
00:43:31,010 --> 00:43:32,450
If we can prove this wrong,

756
00:43:32,840 --> 00:43:35,510
then we have a good case for
a second genesis of life.

757
00:43:35,540 --> 00:43:38,240
But not until we have proved
these two hypotheses wrong.

758
00:43:39,980 --> 00:43:43,250
Now the first one I had thought that
the second one would be the easy one.

759
00:43:43,280 --> 00:43:46,160
It turns out that, uh, I'm, I'm still,

760
00:43:46,190 --> 00:43:48,320
as I keep thinking through this logic,

761
00:43:48,670 --> 00:43:51,470
it turns out the dye might not be the
case. I'll tell you why in a second.

762
00:43:51,770 --> 00:43:54,110
The first one that's in
the Abe articulate bothers.

763
00:43:54,111 --> 00:43:56,480
It turns out that it's not that
hard to do if you think about it.

764
00:43:56,840 --> 00:44:00,560
Cause if you keep thinking on this
framework, organic chemical evolution,

765
00:44:00,860 --> 00:44:05,630
the universe, it's very lazy at making
stuff. It doesn't really like to make big,

766
00:44:05,631 --> 00:44:09,620
complicated stuff. Likes to make a
lot of simple stuff. That's why water,

767
00:44:09,650 --> 00:44:12,710
carbon nitrogen, that's mostly
the composition of the universe.

768
00:44:12,980 --> 00:44:15,860
And in terms of organics,
amino acids, a few sugars,

769
00:44:15,861 --> 00:44:20,630
some nuclear basis and a lot of graphite
there is really, it's like, okay,

770
00:44:21,260 --> 00:44:22,820
that's it.
That's as far as I'm going to go.

771
00:44:23,480 --> 00:44:26,930
And there is a predictable actually
pattern in the comp in the complexity of

772
00:44:26,931 --> 00:44:29,600
organic chemistry that you can
expect in the absence of life.

773
00:44:29,810 --> 00:44:32,790
That's what you see here
exemplified in the case off.

774
00:44:32,791 --> 00:44:34,500
I think these are amino acids.

775
00:44:35,160 --> 00:44:40,160
These are plots of showing carbon number
and I mean a lot to these hydrocarbons.

776
00:44:41,550 --> 00:44:42,510
This is carbon number.

777
00:44:42,660 --> 00:44:45,480
So the more carbons or molecule
has the more complex it is,

778
00:44:45,481 --> 00:44:46,530
the harder it is to build.

779
00:44:47,790 --> 00:44:52,170
And this is what you see in terms of
carbon number distributions or abundances

780
00:44:52,380 --> 00:44:54,630
in hydrocarbons,
molecules made of cartilage,

781
00:44:54,960 --> 00:44:59,730
carbon and hydrogen in in a biotic
systems here is in hydrothermal vents,

782
00:45:00,020 --> 00:45:03,960
a directly sampled in the ocean and also
in hydrothermal simulations in the lab.

783
00:45:04,200 --> 00:45:09,150
There's a lot of methane with one carbon
and there is a tiny bit of ethane and

784
00:45:09,151 --> 00:45:12,630
propane and there is almost nothing
of anything bigger than carbon six.

785
00:45:13,590 --> 00:45:16,920
And you can see the same distribution
in meteorites. You can see the same,

786
00:45:16,921 --> 00:45:21,340
the situation in a organic chemistry,
uh,

787
00:45:22,170 --> 00:45:24,330
uh,
experiments in the laboratory.

788
00:45:24,450 --> 00:45:28,500
We always end up with these ex exponential
decay in abundance as a function of

789
00:45:28,501 --> 00:45:29,334
carbon numbers.

790
00:45:29,630 --> 00:45:33,840
A here is what I would think to do
if I was going to go to Enceladus.

791
00:45:34,020 --> 00:45:37,560
Actually Cassini has already done some
of the groundwork because CD has an

792
00:45:37,561 --> 00:45:40,500
ally's hydrocarbons coming
out of the plume of Enceladus.

793
00:45:40,770 --> 00:45:42,390
These are the distribution
of these thoughts there.

794
00:45:42,690 --> 00:45:45,360
They fall down the exponential decay line.

795
00:45:45,600 --> 00:45:49,920
Now unfortunately Cassini could see
on the app the carbon six or so.

796
00:45:49,950 --> 00:45:52,470
I told you that in the beginning so we
don't really know what's going on in the

797
00:45:52,471 --> 00:45:54,810
plume up there.
If there was no life,

798
00:45:54,840 --> 00:45:59,840
the prediction would be that the abundance
of hydrocarbons larger than six or

799
00:46:00,301 --> 00:46:03,450
seven carbons would be like this one.
There will be nothing there.

800
00:46:03,750 --> 00:46:07,680
But if we go there and we sampled the
plume and we started to see weird stuff,

801
00:46:08,130 --> 00:46:10,830
that's not something we can explain
based on their battery chemistry. Now,

802
00:46:10,831 --> 00:46:14,970
I haven't made it any position or any
assumption on the biochemistry of forms of

803
00:46:14,971 --> 00:46:18,360
life on Enceladus. I'm just saying that
I cannot explain that a biologically.

804
00:46:19,230 --> 00:46:22,770
And so something else must be explained
that and that just for the case of

805
00:46:22,950 --> 00:46:24,810
hydrocarbons,
if we look at amino acids,

806
00:46:24,811 --> 00:46:29,460
is a very similar story
because the universe always
works in mysterious ways. Uh,

807
00:46:29,610 --> 00:46:33,660
it likes to make a particularly small
amino acid, two carbons, three carbons.

808
00:46:33,960 --> 00:46:37,680
That's mostly the staff you'll
find in meteorites and stuff. Uh,

809
00:46:37,770 --> 00:46:41,370
and then very few of the very
large carbon amino acids,

810
00:46:41,580 --> 00:46:44,490
except when you look at life,
and these are the red dots here.

811
00:46:44,730 --> 00:46:46,680
These are all our amino acids.

812
00:46:46,710 --> 00:46:48,960
The relative abundance of
immuno acid in ourselves,

813
00:46:49,480 --> 00:46:51,360
a nine of them is higher than 10%.

814
00:46:51,690 --> 00:46:54,060
We don't care how many
carbons the immuno acid has.

815
00:46:54,300 --> 00:46:57,720
We care about what that amino
acid glass for us. And so if it,

816
00:46:57,750 --> 00:46:59,470
if we need a 10 carbon immuno acid,

817
00:46:59,580 --> 00:47:02,310
we'll invest the energy to build
those 10 carbon immuno acids.

818
00:47:02,730 --> 00:47:06,960
And so what we'll end up with is and a
biotech distribution that's predictable

819
00:47:07,200 --> 00:47:12,060
and he did an exponential decay on
with carbon number and any other non,

820
00:47:12,140 --> 00:47:15,780
uh, exponential distribution
is not something that we
can explain a biologically,

821
00:47:16,140 --> 00:47:19,830
not saying it, it's not a
biotic, but until we find a
neighbor Arctic explanation,

822
00:47:20,070 --> 00:47:22,920
uh,
the best alternative is a form of life.

823
00:47:24,720 --> 00:47:29,530
Now
this is an example of that same principle.

824
00:47:29,560 --> 00:47:32,350
This is the amino acid.
These are six, five,

825
00:47:32,351 --> 00:47:37,351
seven amino acids that are commonly
found in meteorites and in organisms on

826
00:47:37,660 --> 00:47:38,290
earth.

827
00:47:38,290 --> 00:47:42,010
This is the abundance that we see for
those immuno acids in carpet with carbon

828
00:47:42,011 --> 00:47:44,200
number.
That's two carbon numbers.

829
00:47:44,201 --> 00:47:47,490
These are I think five
carbon numbers in meteorites.

830
00:47:47,500 --> 00:47:50,770
You see the exponential decay in life,
you see a very different pattern.

831
00:47:51,130 --> 00:47:54,880
So that's the stuff we need to look for.
Now

832
00:47:56,860 --> 00:47:58,030
the second I bought disease,

833
00:47:58,060 --> 00:48:01,240
if we go to sellers and we have these
distributions that we cannot explain it

834
00:48:01,250 --> 00:48:05,140
[inaudible] then we need to show that
it's not stuff that we brought with us or

835
00:48:05,141 --> 00:48:07,060
it's tough that was
transferred between planets.

836
00:48:07,240 --> 00:48:09,580
That's what we call the
terrestrial null hypothesis.

837
00:48:09,790 --> 00:48:12,250
And I have thought that that would be
the easy one because we do that all the

838
00:48:12,251 --> 00:48:14,890
time, all the time on the
earth. We study ancestry.

839
00:48:14,920 --> 00:48:17,050
That's what we do when we
look at DNA and proteins.

840
00:48:17,051 --> 00:48:20,170
We tried to establish and gestural
relations between organisms.

841
00:48:20,440 --> 00:48:22,960
So if we go to Enceladus,
uh,

842
00:48:22,961 --> 00:48:27,150
it should be fairly easy to establish
ancestral relations and and terming

843
00:48:27,151 --> 00:48:29,740
whether they came out of our three
or they came from a different tree.

844
00:48:30,040 --> 00:48:33,250
Now the problem with that is,
and that's where I'm going to stop.

845
00:48:33,910 --> 00:48:38,500
So we could look at all these molecules,
DNA on earth, non DNA, a second,

846
00:48:38,501 --> 00:48:41,930
genesis, three letter, genetic
code, Different Code. Uh,

847
00:48:41,980 --> 00:48:45,160
we look for different types of proteins
or different sales structures and all

848
00:48:45,161 --> 00:48:49,240
that good stuff. Now here's the problem
though. That's where I'm stopping.

849
00:48:49,930 --> 00:48:51,730
We go back to our famous tree of life.

850
00:48:52,480 --> 00:48:54,880
It turns out that everything
we know about biochemistry,

851
00:48:54,940 --> 00:48:57,280
because of the virtue of how
life on earth has evolved,

852
00:48:57,880 --> 00:49:01,900
can only be really trace back to Luca,
the last universal common ancestor.

853
00:49:01,901 --> 00:49:05,560
You can think of that, or at least I
think of that as a biochemical horizon.

854
00:49:05,890 --> 00:49:09,760
We cannot see beyond that biochemical
horizon because we've lost all that

855
00:49:09,761 --> 00:49:14,680
information. No photo albums off
of our family before look at,

856
00:49:14,710 --> 00:49:17,890
there is no nothing preserved
in the rocks other than shapes.

857
00:49:18,220 --> 00:49:21,760
There's no chemistry projecting the
rugs. It was too, too long ago. So we,

858
00:49:22,110 --> 00:49:24,550
we can't really tell what
biochemistry was back then.

859
00:49:24,640 --> 00:49:27,730
All we know about biochemistry
stops and starts with Luca.

860
00:49:28,360 --> 00:49:33,360
And so any biochemical difference
becomes between live on earth or another

861
00:49:33,521 --> 00:49:33,751
planet.

862
00:49:33,751 --> 00:49:38,751
It becomes questionable whether it implies
a second genesis or implies a common

863
00:49:39,941 --> 00:49:40,774
ancestor.

864
00:49:40,810 --> 00:49:44,890
And that's even more so when we start
looking for a close second genesis that we

865
00:49:44,891 --> 00:49:48,340
all came up or the of the same
soup because we never know.

866
00:49:48,341 --> 00:49:53,110
We will never know the exact composition
of the first organism. It's, it,

867
00:49:53,200 --> 00:49:57,970
it might be impossible to actually tell
a close second genesis from a common

868
00:49:57,971 --> 00:50:02,580
ancestor. That's what my thinking was as
off 10:00 AM this morning. And so, uh,

869
00:50:02,650 --> 00:50:06,580
maybe I come up with a better
idea later today, but, uh, that's,

870
00:50:06,581 --> 00:50:09,670
I think it's a very interesting
question to think about. Uh,

871
00:50:09,671 --> 00:50:14,050
it might be an actual limitation in our
understanding of cert on how we search

872
00:50:14,051 --> 00:50:17,050
for life in the universe. And so just
to leave some time for questions,

873
00:50:17,051 --> 00:50:19,810
I'll leave you with the conclusions.
They just summarize what I just said.

874
00:50:19,811 --> 00:50:23,410
We can read them as we are. If you have
questions, I'll be happy to answer them.

875
00:50:23,411 --> 00:50:24,700
So thank you very much.

876
00:50:25,600 --> 00:50:27,570
[inaudible].

877
00:50:32,590 --> 00:50:35,270
So my question is,
as far as we know,

878
00:50:35,271 --> 00:50:38,690
it's apostle tuff life does not,
not based on it

879
00:50:38,740 --> 00:50:42,190
biochemistry.
Well we will call it bio chemistry.

880
00:50:42,910 --> 00:50:45,190
It might be a different,
very different types of biochemistry.

881
00:50:45,610 --> 00:50:48,240
The moment you talked about life
live by chemistry, there's no names.

882
00:50:48,250 --> 00:50:50,740
It's anonymous kind of thing.
It might be not carbon based.

883
00:50:50,770 --> 00:50:52,510
That's probably what you're
more thinking about it.

884
00:50:52,700 --> 00:50:55,130
Oh yeah.
Or even similar to AI.

885
00:50:56,120 --> 00:51:01,020
All different dimensions you can,
if you can have AI evolving from nothing.

886
00:51:01,050 --> 00:51:02,220
Like it varies.

887
00:51:02,460 --> 00:51:06,720
If you can come up with a theory of
silicon organic or evolution or silica

888
00:51:06,721 --> 00:51:08,640
evolution, uh, then yes.

889
00:51:09,090 --> 00:51:13,440
A base that our assumption
is that any AI was,

890
00:51:13,970 --> 00:51:14,803
uh,

891
00:51:15,630 --> 00:51:19,950
comes not from spontaneous
or a spontaneous chemistry,

892
00:51:20,370 --> 00:51:23,930
but from biochemistry,
you need biochemistry for ar to exist.

893
00:51:27,950 --> 00:51:29,880
That's an interesting question. Uh, if we,

894
00:51:29,881 --> 00:51:32,610
if we want to go into the concept
of artificial, that's, oof,

895
00:51:32,950 --> 00:51:34,910
we can have another talk
about that artificial,

896
00:51:36,690 --> 00:51:38,940
but something similar to
the composition of Ai,

897
00:51:39,470 --> 00:51:44,470
like in that it's very ritual that
people have proposed silicon based life,

898
00:51:44,910 --> 00:51:46,290
but they weren't thinking of microchips.

899
00:51:46,291 --> 00:51:49,500
They were thinking of the actual
element and how it could sustain about

900
00:51:49,501 --> 00:51:51,390
chemistry analogous the carbon.

901
00:51:51,780 --> 00:51:56,310
But silicon based life has very different
properties. It's very constrained.

902
00:51:56,880 --> 00:51:58,470
And in reality,

903
00:51:58,471 --> 00:52:03,090
I mean obviously you can never reject
the idea of silicon based life again,

904
00:52:03,240 --> 00:52:05,740
but the element, not the microchip, uh,

905
00:52:05,760 --> 00:52:09,270
but it's not an accident
that we're made of. Carbon.

906
00:52:09,390 --> 00:52:12,780
Carbon is the third most abundant element
or fourth more abundant element in the

907
00:52:12,781 --> 00:52:17,010
universe. And the other one is
oxygen, nitrogen, hydrogen and helium.

908
00:52:17,011 --> 00:52:18,270
So other than the helium,

909
00:52:18,510 --> 00:52:22,140
we're pretty much covered the entire
wheel state of the university in terms of

910
00:52:22,141 --> 00:52:26,350
elemental composition. There
is no accident that we're
made of that stuff. Um,

911
00:52:26,670 --> 00:52:30,420
there might be weird things out there,
but for those weird things to exist,

912
00:52:30,940 --> 00:52:31,773
they will,

913
00:52:31,830 --> 00:52:36,180
they would have to be a
process of chemical destination
where carbon is removed

914
00:52:36,181 --> 00:52:41,181
from the equation and therefore
allows weird silicon stuff to evolve.

915
00:52:41,710 --> 00:52:46,320
Uh, when it comes to AI, I think for, uh,

916
00:52:46,380 --> 00:52:49,920
behind every intelligent being there
is a bacteria at least evolutionary,

917
00:52:50,400 --> 00:52:54,120
evolutionarily speaking. So he has to
come from organic chemistry at some point.

918
00:52:55,350 --> 00:52:59,140
Getting back to the previous slide,
I don't,

919
00:52:59,270 --> 00:53:04,270
I don't really understand your thought
process about why we have their pow pow,

920
00:53:06,790 --> 00:53:11,600
uh, chemical, you know, horizon
is that because we assume,

921
00:53:12,070 --> 00:53:16,510
uh, all the, uh, you call it, Uhm, uh,

922
00:53:16,950 --> 00:53:19,310
organism under the low carb.
You see,

923
00:53:19,311 --> 00:53:22,490
we see new chase between the,
you know,

924
00:53:23,930 --> 00:53:26,130
chemical compilation,
any proof

925
00:53:26,190 --> 00:53:29,490
or evidence around there. So,
so I don't follow that. I, yeah,

926
00:53:29,491 --> 00:53:33,980
I I I right with that because I was a
thought I was running out of time, but uh,

927
00:53:34,050 --> 00:53:36,330
everything,
so obviously we are here.

928
00:53:36,780 --> 00:53:39,780
You can think of that as a
spacetime diagrams so to speak.

929
00:53:40,170 --> 00:53:45,170
We are here now at the tape of the o
carriers and we have our technology to

930
00:53:45,360 --> 00:53:50,360
investigate biochemistry so we can go
about studying biochemistry many different

931
00:53:51,691 --> 00:53:51,871
ways.

932
00:53:51,871 --> 00:53:55,920
We can go and dissect an elephant and
understand the chemistry of the elephant,

933
00:53:56,190 --> 00:54:00,840
or we can go through the fossil record
and look for fossilized organisms and we

934
00:54:01,500 --> 00:54:04,380
investigated their biochemistry
so we can be looking for this.

935
00:54:04,620 --> 00:54:05,730
We can look for deep,

936
00:54:06,060 --> 00:54:11,060
deeply branching modern organisms that
we know existed a long time ago and we

937
00:54:11,311 --> 00:54:15,540
can look at their biochemistry.
We can even look at our own biochemistry,

938
00:54:15,570 --> 00:54:19,560
our own DNA, and look for what
we call molecular fossils staff.

939
00:54:19,560 --> 00:54:22,920
There is in our DNA, don't think
of it, it's not trashed DNA,

940
00:54:22,921 --> 00:54:25,650
but think of it as stuff that
at some point was useful.

941
00:54:25,651 --> 00:54:30,390
It's not useful anymore type of thing.
Now really all that biochemistry,

942
00:54:30,420 --> 00:54:34,650
whether it's modern fossil or ancient,
it goes back to looker.

943
00:54:35,250 --> 00:54:35,671
Really.

944
00:54:35,671 --> 00:54:39,510
You can also only trades back that to
this last universal common ancestor.

945
00:54:39,780 --> 00:54:44,780
You can really not make any substantial
inference based on these biochemistry

946
00:54:45,150 --> 00:54:48,030
about these biochemistry because
all of these records is known.

947
00:54:48,420 --> 00:54:51,680
Obviously these biochemistry
evolved from this. Uh,

948
00:54:51,810 --> 00:54:56,810
but the notion that all organisms have
DNA and RNA and their composition,

949
00:54:57,960 --> 00:55:00,270
20 amino acids in their proteins,

950
00:55:00,630 --> 00:55:04,200
the genetic code as we understand it all
that is because it comes from looker.

951
00:55:05,160 --> 00:55:08,680
There could have been branches coming
out that had a different biochemistry or

952
00:55:08,681 --> 00:55:11,340
we'll never know if they exist or
not cause they would have been lost.

953
00:55:11,910 --> 00:55:16,080
We don't know if these organisms had
20 amino acids or a 10 amino acids. Uh,

954
00:55:16,081 --> 00:55:16,620
we don't know.

955
00:55:16,620 --> 00:55:19,890
We actually know that at some point
there were in DNA based people have

956
00:55:19,891 --> 00:55:22,560
postulated the RNA world.
There was a wall,

957
00:55:22,590 --> 00:55:27,000
there was a period of time where there
was no DNA biochemistry on earth.

958
00:55:27,030 --> 00:55:28,110
It was RNA based.

959
00:55:28,380 --> 00:55:31,890
They will have postulated
that RNA probably was not
the first generic molecule.

960
00:55:32,130 --> 00:55:36,600
There was another different type of
molecule and people have even postulated a

961
00:55:36,990 --> 00:55:37,950
metal enzymes,

962
00:55:37,951 --> 00:55:42,120
enzymes based on magnesium and zinc
and other metal compounds that were the

963
00:55:42,121 --> 00:55:46,260
first catalyzing compounds.
So the more you go back in time,

964
00:55:46,560 --> 00:55:50,280
the more you realize that our biochemistry
is not representative really of these

965
00:55:50,281 --> 00:55:54,260
biochemistry. It can only
be trace back to Luca. Uh,

966
00:55:54,420 --> 00:55:58,380
and so that really means
that if you go to, I'll,

967
00:55:58,630 --> 00:56:01,860
I'll give you the basic example. If I go
to Mars and I find a microbe that does,

968
00:56:01,900 --> 00:56:03,060
Dan doesn't have DNA,

969
00:56:04,090 --> 00:56:06,680
all I can tell you right now is
that this didn't come out of looker.

970
00:56:08,290 --> 00:56:09,123
I see.

971
00:56:09,330 --> 00:56:14,310
I don't know if it came out of these
branch that was not DNA base and I don't

972
00:56:14,311 --> 00:56:17,610
know because they could
have been transferred or
transfer of live on Mars very

973
00:56:17,611 --> 00:56:20,700
early on where there
was live on the earth,

974
00:56:20,701 --> 00:56:23,410
very likely not DNA or RNA based.

975
00:56:23,650 --> 00:56:27,520
It would look like are different from us
because the moment it gets transferred,

976
00:56:27,760 --> 00:56:30,830
these evolutionary land gets broken,
then they're having time.

977
00:56:31,070 --> 00:56:32,480
I see. So, so, so,

978
00:56:32,510 --> 00:56:36,920
so I see that the purpose of the
research is trying to prove the second,

979
00:56:36,950 --> 00:56:40,730
the form of a [inaudible] space.
The life you started,

980
00:56:40,940 --> 00:56:45,030
you started of simply prove their life.
I break this,

981
00:56:45,360 --> 00:56:48,750
I, I'd been advocating for that from a
science point of view and I didn't really

982
00:56:48,751 --> 00:56:50,670
emphasize that.
But from a science point of view,

983
00:56:51,030 --> 00:56:53,430
if you think a scientist
is mung soft knowledge,

984
00:56:53,520 --> 00:56:57,930
people who are very
obsessed with knowledge base
discovering live is not really

985
00:56:57,931 --> 00:57:01,320
the angle that's stuff for you know,

986
00:57:03,030 --> 00:57:07,930
for explorers. I didn't
know at somebody put it. Um,

987
00:57:08,460 --> 00:57:11,340
if you discover life on another planet,

988
00:57:12,000 --> 00:57:16,990
I mean the bottom line is that as a
scientist we shouldn't think about the uh,

989
00:57:17,040 --> 00:57:20,460
the Scott finding life as the angle.
That's when things begin.

990
00:57:20,790 --> 00:57:24,840
The reason and I end it goes back to my
original argument about why we searching

991
00:57:24,841 --> 00:57:27,510
for life. Why are we searching
for a second genesis of life?

992
00:57:27,930 --> 00:57:30,840
One of the reasons because we will never
understand the origin of life on earth

993
00:57:30,841 --> 00:57:33,090
unless we find a second
genesis plain and simple.

994
00:57:33,360 --> 00:57:36,090
Second one is because we may never
understand all these process.

995
00:57:36,810 --> 00:57:38,450
Third example is because
we buy a neighbor,

996
00:57:38,451 --> 00:57:42,210
I understand the range of biochemical
possibilities out there and so finding

997
00:57:42,211 --> 00:57:46,710
live is just what needs to happen for
us to start addressing those questions.

998
00:57:46,970 --> 00:57:48,620
Yeah. Thank you very much. Thank you all.

999
00:57:48,621 --> 00:57:50,790
It shouldn't be just about
searching or finding.

1000
00:57:50,791 --> 00:57:53,580
It should be about finding a second.
Genesis.

1001
00:57:55,410 --> 00:57:58,410
Um, I do have a quick question
from someone on the live stream.

1002
00:57:58,411 --> 00:58:00,150
So this is from Tyler.

1003
00:58:00,360 --> 00:58:05,160
He says a does hydrothermal vents on
the moon mean that it has a molten core?

1004
00:58:05,830 --> 00:58:08,600
Yes,
I

1005
00:58:10,250 --> 00:58:14,060
got that Tyler. So, uh,

1006
00:58:15,010 --> 00:58:18,460
obviously based on [inaudible]
bed, uh, the observation,

1007
00:58:18,461 --> 00:58:22,160
I guess I'll try, I'll
trace it back. So, uh,

1008
00:58:22,390 --> 00:58:26,950
as we travel back in time, um, the uh,

1009
00:58:26,951 --> 00:58:30,850
observation that we
can, uh, be sure about,

1010
00:58:30,851 --> 00:58:35,820
he's this silicon nano grains in the
plume of Enceladus. Now, uh, the best,

1011
00:58:35,880 --> 00:58:37,350
the most likely explanation for that.

1012
00:58:37,351 --> 00:58:40,810
So those Silicon Alley Grains
are hydrothermal vents at
the bottom of the ocean.

1013
00:58:41,080 --> 00:58:44,560
We haven't seen the events. It's true
everything we know about the moon though.

1014
00:58:44,950 --> 00:58:46,720
So Jazz,
the Dera hydrothermal vents there,

1015
00:58:47,560 --> 00:58:52,180
what that implies is that there is a
source of heat underneath the vents then

1016
00:58:52,181 --> 00:58:55,800
was likely source of heat is
some kind of molten core, uh,

1017
00:58:55,840 --> 00:58:59,380
due to the gravity pressures
due to the Saturn orbit.

1018
00:58:59,800 --> 00:59:04,780
That just creates an off, uh,
gravitational stress on the moon,

1019
00:59:04,781 --> 00:59:08,830
that it actually keeps the whole core
molten, just like the core of the earth.

1020
00:59:08,830 --> 00:59:13,810
Now, there could be additional sources
of heat, like radioactive decay,

1021
00:59:14,160 --> 00:59:17,950
a generates heat. Uh, but the fact that
we see evidence of hydrothermal activity,

1022
00:59:18,280 --> 00:59:22,340
it's a strong suggestion that the core
of the moon is in fact at least partially

1023
00:59:22,341 --> 00:59:24,260
molten and exactly as a source of energy,

1024
00:59:24,590 --> 00:59:27,080
which is something that has
been interesting as well
because that implies that

1025
00:59:27,400 --> 00:59:30,140
uh, probably Europa is the same
scenario. You're all busy going bigger,

1026
00:59:30,410 --> 00:59:35,410
but he has the same kind of a giant
planet and around causing gravity pools.

1027
00:59:35,780 --> 00:59:37,620
And so your boot x, you should, uh,

1028
00:59:37,640 --> 00:59:40,310
we should expect hydrothermal vents
at the bottom of Europe as well,

1029
00:59:43,190 --> 00:59:45,470
molten rock.
So a,

1030
00:59:45,471 --> 00:59:48,740
the composition of those months,

1031
00:59:49,280 --> 00:59:51,620
obviously it's not known because
we haven't analyzed them,

1032
00:59:51,621 --> 00:59:55,250
but based on everything we know, again,
that most likely starting materials,

1033
00:59:55,400 --> 00:59:58,620
we're not probably not different from
the starting materials of the earth. Con,

1034
00:59:58,650 --> 01:00:01,790
dried meteorites made rides of asteroids,
comets,

1035
01:00:02,030 --> 01:00:06,000
lots of IC stuff because they were far
away in the outskirts of the solar system.

1036
01:00:06,001 --> 01:00:06,834
So what's cold,

1037
01:00:07,430 --> 01:00:12,430
but it was probably stuff similar to
what generated the earth now on earth

1038
01:00:13,461 --> 01:00:16,400
because it's a big planet.
There are always plenty of room for,

1039
01:00:16,820 --> 01:00:20,740
and obviously we all started the same
way as a big molten ball of lava.

1040
01:00:21,140 --> 01:00:23,870
It's then was started that
way. Europa, the earth,

1041
01:00:24,320 --> 01:00:26,750
the earth was large enough
that when he called down,

1042
01:00:27,020 --> 01:00:30,440
there was plenty of room for
heavy stuff to fall off, uh,

1043
01:00:30,770 --> 01:00:33,140
because the cooling
process was probably slow.

1044
01:00:33,770 --> 01:00:37,610
And so when you call it slow,
it's like when you cook it slow,

1045
01:00:37,880 --> 01:00:42,680
things get better separated and
stuff like this. Uh, so, uh,

1046
01:00:43,220 --> 01:00:46,400
that's what happened on the
earth. The planet was big
enough, the cooling was low,

1047
01:00:46,401 --> 01:00:50,780
so heavy stuff like Aaron
and heavy metals drop to the,

1048
01:00:51,170 --> 01:00:54,020
to the core and formed our core
and sell it as is very small.

1049
01:00:54,020 --> 01:00:58,040
So it probably called very fast without
a chance for things to differentiate.

1050
01:00:58,520 --> 01:00:59,960
So what you have there in the core,

1051
01:00:59,961 --> 01:01:03,350
it's probably still very representative
of the original materials and the other,

1052
01:01:03,380 --> 01:01:05,830
the only staff that was,
uh,

1053
01:01:05,990 --> 01:01:09,680
kicked out in the cooling process was
probably stop there is volatile like water

1054
01:01:10,040 --> 01:01:13,910
and that's why you have an ocean of
liquid water on the surface and a lot of

1055
01:01:13,911 --> 01:01:16,160
methane and stuff,
which are all that stuff.

1056
01:01:16,520 --> 01:01:20,260
It doesn't take high temperatures for
that stuff to come out of the rock. Uh,

1057
01:01:20,420 --> 01:01:25,280
but the silica, the minerals, things
like these that formed these meteorites,

1058
01:01:25,281 --> 01:01:28,400
it's probably still more than,
they're not changing much.

1059
01:01:30,050 --> 01:01:31,850
I don't know why I stopped in this.

1060
01:01:34,140 --> 01:01:36,260
So not being very familiar with the,

1061
01:01:36,540 --> 01:01:39,180
this common ancestor of all life on earth.

1062
01:01:39,270 --> 01:01:43,890
Is that Luca meant to be like one cell
once back in time or just the origin?

1063
01:01:44,040 --> 01:01:48,840
Yeah, them question right. Uh,
we are now anything we can,

1064
01:01:49,170 --> 01:01:52,230
the only thing we can say for sure about
the origin of life on earth is that we

1065
01:01:52,231 --> 01:01:55,830
don't know, uh, it must have
happened, that's for sure.

1066
01:01:57,160 --> 01:02:01,150
And Lez well, there is the,
you know, the holographic
Unilever's and matrix. But, uh,

1067
01:02:01,350 --> 01:02:05,430
let's assume that it happened. Um, um,

1068
01:02:06,360 --> 01:02:09,660
there are theories on how you could
possibly envision it happening gradually.

1069
01:02:09,690 --> 01:02:11,250
Obviously it wasn't just like that.

1070
01:02:11,700 --> 01:02:16,700
Probably there was a combination of
a molecular complexity happening.

1071
01:02:16,980 --> 01:02:20,820
Eventually you need to self enclose
something so there is detached from the

1072
01:02:20,821 --> 01:02:25,821
environment and at some point that self
enclosed thing that you can probably not

1073
01:02:26,101 --> 01:02:27,240
still called live yet.

1074
01:02:27,590 --> 01:02:32,460
It has to have the ability of
replicating or passing on information,

1075
01:02:32,490 --> 01:02:33,960
which is really what defines life.

1076
01:02:34,380 --> 01:02:36,390
So at that point that's
when you talk about life.

1077
01:02:36,420 --> 01:02:40,230
But that transition was probably a part
of the ongoing process of evolution,

1078
01:02:40,231 --> 01:02:42,060
of chemical evolution,
how it happened.

1079
01:02:42,061 --> 01:02:47,061
We don't know if it was one cell or if
it was a protoplasm of goo covered with

1080
01:02:49,260 --> 01:02:52,020
stuff that we don't know.

1081
01:02:52,630 --> 01:02:56,250
It was probably not anything
like what we think today. Uh,

1082
01:02:56,310 --> 01:02:59,070
Tau rose who was one of the,
uh,

1083
01:02:59,280 --> 01:03:04,280
instigators of our modern understanding
of biochemistry at this grabs is in a

1084
01:03:05,191 --> 01:03:06,480
way that way.
I did,

1085
01:03:06,810 --> 01:03:10,410
I described it earlier in the process of
crystallization of lava crystallizing.

1086
01:03:10,980 --> 01:03:14,670
So it starts randomly and chaotically
and slowly as it cools down,

1087
01:03:15,210 --> 01:03:18,480
it becomes something more organized,
complex.

1088
01:03:19,020 --> 01:03:22,950
And eventually you end up with
a self replicating entity,

1089
01:03:23,400 --> 01:03:25,200
call it a cell or a guru.

1090
01:03:25,740 --> 01:03:29,550
And then that's when the process of
Darwinian evolution kicks and then

1091
01:03:29,551 --> 01:03:34,320
complexity, it just goes off the roof.
Um, but it's all part of the same.

1092
01:03:35,000 --> 01:03:38,900
And so it's really hard to
tell how it started, how it,

1093
01:03:39,010 --> 01:03:41,820
if we were to travel back to four
and a half billion years ago,

1094
01:03:41,821 --> 01:03:44,250
4.2 billion years ago,
uh,

1095
01:03:45,000 --> 01:03:48,960
it probably be be hard pressed to tell
whether it's life that we see there

1096
01:03:49,020 --> 01:03:53,220
versus very complex prebiotic chemistry
versus something entirely different.

1097
01:03:53,880 --> 01:03:58,840
Yeah. But we don't know. We need more
data points to really know that. And,

1098
01:03:59,190 --> 01:04:01,680
and that, I think that's a very
important point to keep in mind.

1099
01:04:02,280 --> 01:04:03,900
Why is important search
for life out there?

1100
01:04:03,901 --> 01:04:06,960
Because we will never know
unless we find a new genesis.

1101
01:04:06,961 --> 01:04:08,760
We can cook as many things,
but if we want in the lab,

1102
01:04:09,240 --> 01:04:14,130
it's very unlikely we'll generate life
in the lab, uh, from zero, from scratch.

1103
01:04:14,670 --> 01:04:18,900
And so, uh, hopefully,
hopefully happens. But, uh,

1104
01:04:18,990 --> 01:04:21,960
but my guess is that not until
we find a second genesis,

1105
01:04:22,470 --> 01:04:26,580
we can really understand the way
life on earth originated. Cool.

1106
01:04:26,670 --> 01:04:30,240
And what's Luca stand for and
what, what does it need, Luca,

1107
01:04:30,241 --> 01:04:33,930
what does it stand for?
Look at last universal common ancestor.

1108
01:04:35,520 --> 01:04:39,480
So my question is what are
the options for detecting

1109
01:04:40,500 --> 01:04:43,470
biotic organic evolution and exoplanets?

1110
01:04:44,370 --> 01:04:48,360
Right now it's an, it's very
unlikely we, we can do it. Uh,

1111
01:04:50,020 --> 01:04:54,060
but I assuming unlimited funds
and technology that doesn't exist,

1112
01:04:54,540 --> 01:04:58,280
you could think of, you
could search for, um,

1113
01:05:01,020 --> 01:05:04,500
chemical. Does that clear?
We an atmosphere in the
atmosphere of exoplanets.

1114
01:05:04,501 --> 01:05:07,170
So obviously the first thing you would
do it would be because there is so many

1115
01:05:07,171 --> 01:05:07,740
of them,

1116
01:05:07,740 --> 01:05:11,450
you would shorten the list and you
would focus on the ones that are close,

1117
01:05:11,820 --> 01:05:14,460
right distance from the sun,
the rice, the right distance,

1118
01:05:14,490 --> 01:05:19,240
define as the distance that allows
liquid water to be stable on the surface.

1119
01:05:19,480 --> 01:05:23,730
So you focus on those. And then in
those you could search for, I mean,

1120
01:05:23,740 --> 01:05:26,290
the atmosphere,
so coexist enough gases,

1121
01:05:26,440 --> 01:05:31,020
they shouldn't coexist unless something
is pumping them in the atmosphere and

1122
01:05:31,021 --> 01:05:35,410
the earth. You have the example of
oxygen, there is high abundance.

1123
01:05:35,440 --> 01:05:40,090
There is no a biotic way of making that
much oxygen in, you know, on a planet.

1124
01:05:40,600 --> 01:05:43,680
Uh, although people have come up
with clever ways of doing it. Uh,

1125
01:05:43,960 --> 01:05:47,560
but the fact that you have oxygen and
methane coexisting all the time means that

1126
01:05:48,190 --> 01:05:52,300
both are being produced because
otherwise they would emulate each other.

1127
01:05:52,330 --> 01:05:53,200
They would cancel the other.

1128
01:05:53,720 --> 01:05:56,580
I meant more. Is it
possible to detect this, um,

1129
01:05:57,890 --> 01:06:01,310
these weird distributions
of carbon chains? Not that

1130
01:06:01,610 --> 01:06:04,160
we need samples for that.
We need, we need stuff.

1131
01:06:04,161 --> 01:06:08,030
We need to be able to inject something
in an instrument to do these types of

1132
01:06:08,031 --> 01:06:08,864
detectors.
We can,

1133
01:06:08,990 --> 01:06:13,990
we can certainly take carbon hydrogen
so we can detect like we've done in,

1134
01:06:14,110 --> 01:06:18,710
uh, uh, interstellar space. You
can detect certain compounds.

1135
01:06:19,000 --> 01:06:23,180
Um, but mostly you detect these
seal to methane and all that stuff.

1136
01:06:23,810 --> 01:06:27,320
Uh,
the abundance of this.

1137
01:06:27,460 --> 01:06:30,480
So I guess I'll give you another
example. We've, we've done,

1138
01:06:30,940 --> 01:06:34,880
we've gone for the thought exercise of
we wanted to detect those molecules on

1139
01:06:34,881 --> 01:06:36,530
Enceladus coming out of the plume.

1140
01:06:36,860 --> 01:06:41,240
What should be our limit of detection
so that if we don't find anything we can

1141
01:06:41,241 --> 01:06:43,040
create a confident that
there is nothing in there.

1142
01:06:43,610 --> 01:06:46,730
And I think our leaders
estimate was we should be,

1143
01:06:46,731 --> 01:06:50,450
our instrument should be able
to detect femto molar abundance.

1144
01:06:50,451 --> 01:06:54,980
That's 10 to the minus
15, uh, concentrations.

1145
01:06:55,670 --> 01:07:00,530
Um, in order to be able to tell, well,
you know what, there is nothing there.

1146
01:07:01,350 --> 01:07:05,780
Uh, and to do that we need the best
instruments on earth and we need a very

1147
01:07:05,781 --> 01:07:08,810
complicated way of collecting enough
material from the ocean that we can

1148
01:07:09,020 --> 01:07:13,490
actually inject into the instruments doing
that remotely with telescopes. It's a,

1149
01:07:13,491 --> 01:07:16,860
it's a show stopper and the
Bra. And so, uh, the, the,

1150
01:07:16,920 --> 01:07:21,110
the fact that you don't see them wouldn't
mean that they're not there because

1151
01:07:21,111 --> 01:07:23,990
your limit of detection
would be so inaccurate.

1152
01:07:24,950 --> 01:07:27,830
You can only say that based
on your limit of detection,

1153
01:07:28,550 --> 01:07:32,780
you can see trees on whatever planet
you have out there. Not even, I mean,

1154
01:07:32,781 --> 01:07:36,180
other people have proposed to
look at the surveys and, uh,

1155
01:07:36,320 --> 01:07:38,300
like if you look at the
surface of the earth,

1156
01:07:38,301 --> 01:07:40,490
you could detect chlorophyll for example,

1157
01:07:41,210 --> 01:07:45,290
but you need a planet like the earth and
you need a satellite orbiting the earth,

1158
01:07:45,650 --> 01:07:48,500
the planet.
You can do that from our Alpha Centauri.

1159
01:07:50,400 --> 01:07:53,850
Um, if I may another question.
So you mentioned that, um,

1160
01:07:54,130 --> 01:07:57,270
it's the stuff in our solar system
was made from a previous star.

1161
01:07:57,990 --> 01:08:02,610
I wonder what the chances are of life, um,
becoming recycled through that process.

1162
01:08:02,830 --> 01:08:07,320
Yeah. Uh, people have looked
into that both in terms of the,

1163
01:08:07,510 --> 01:08:12,040
the problem of transfer of light
between planets or live surviving.

1164
01:08:12,610 --> 01:08:17,450
And again, it's, um, uh,

1165
01:08:17,960 --> 01:08:21,750
you can always fit a model
to anything you want. Uh,

1166
01:08:22,160 --> 01:08:26,890
but life is very resilient and surviving
in dormant state that we know. Uh,

1167
01:08:26,891 --> 01:08:30,950
and there are scenarios when you think
about the transfer of planet of life

1168
01:08:30,951 --> 01:08:32,030
between Earth and Mars,

1169
01:08:32,430 --> 01:08:36,890
there are plausible scenarios of rocks
moving from one plan to the next in time

1170
01:08:37,700 --> 01:08:40,250
scales that are shorter than what we know.

1171
01:08:40,251 --> 01:08:44,720
Microbes can survive doormen
that much we can say. Uh,

1172
01:08:44,750 --> 01:08:49,750
and when he comes to commentary Panspermia
so life come originating in the end,

1173
01:08:51,141 --> 01:08:52,170
it really comes back to,

1174
01:08:52,171 --> 01:08:57,070
it comes down to how big a chunk of
material you have floating around. Uh,

1175
01:08:57,290 --> 01:09:02,280
because really what kills out there
is not the cold is the radiation. Uh,

1176
01:09:03,800 --> 01:09:05,030
time kills eventually,

1177
01:09:05,060 --> 01:09:09,770
but it takes a long time for time
to kill and nothing else. Uh,

1178
01:09:10,040 --> 01:09:12,620
radiation is what really
kills you quickly are there.

1179
01:09:12,770 --> 01:09:14,930
So if you're a microbe sitting in the,

1180
01:09:15,590 --> 01:09:19,940
in the nucleus of a big asteroid and
we talk in a few kilometers in size,

1181
01:09:20,240 --> 01:09:24,680
you'll probably will never see an
obligation to kill you over hundreds of

1182
01:09:24,680 --> 01:09:29,210
millions of years. Uh, and so, uh,
it's, I'm oversimplifying a bit,

1183
01:09:29,211 --> 01:09:33,500
but um, you can always find a plausible
scenario where a microbe could survive.

1184
01:09:34,160 --> 01:09:39,080
Bottom line, I don't think we should
expect that to be the first explanation.

1185
01:09:39,680 --> 01:09:41,600
But the problem is that
you can rule it out.

1186
01:09:41,780 --> 01:09:46,780
There's no amount of hand waving you can
do to rule that possibility out until

1187
01:09:47,091 --> 01:09:50,870
you go and you find a second
genesis of life on Mars truly.

1188
01:09:51,230 --> 01:09:55,550
And then you can confidently say that
life on earth didn't originate out of that

1189
01:09:55,551 --> 01:09:59,020
comment or that commentary or
that he wasn't transfer. Uh,

1190
01:09:59,250 --> 01:10:01,430
as long as you don't find a
second geneses that quest,

1191
01:10:01,431 --> 01:10:04,640
that possibility is always going to be
open, which is a very important thing.

1192
01:10:04,641 --> 01:10:09,170
I don't want to keep you, but it's a
very, I didn't mention that, but it's a,

1193
01:10:09,320 --> 01:10:11,960
it really speaks to how we
search for live as well.

1194
01:10:11,961 --> 01:10:14,600
Because when you think about
a second genesis and how,

1195
01:10:14,670 --> 01:10:18,260
and to distinguish between the second
genesis and a possible common origin,

1196
01:10:18,890 --> 01:10:23,330
not every bio signature is equal.
If you find, if you go to Mars,

1197
01:10:23,530 --> 01:10:28,100
I don't know if you guys
know about stromatolites, uh,
there, these are microbial.

1198
01:10:28,190 --> 01:10:32,570
There are rugs there are made or by
microbial activity and their fossilized.

1199
01:10:32,810 --> 01:10:35,090
And we say, I mean the fossil record, uh,

1200
01:10:35,450 --> 01:10:37,940
and would you see in the fossil
record is just the shape of the rock.

1201
01:10:38,180 --> 01:10:40,640
That looks weird,

1202
01:10:40,970 --> 01:10:45,050
but it is nothing in that world that
speaks of life other than the shape. Now,

1203
01:10:45,051 --> 01:10:47,780
if we go to Mars,
actually I'm too far away.

1204
01:10:48,140 --> 01:10:50,930
If we go to Mars and we find a
stromatolite these weird shape,

1205
01:10:52,190 --> 01:10:54,260
maybe you can tell there was
life on Mars at some point,

1206
01:10:54,410 --> 01:10:56,300
but you can't tell how we originated.

1207
01:10:56,420 --> 01:10:58,640
You will never tell based on
the shape of stromatolites,

1208
01:10:58,910 --> 01:11:02,150
whether it's a common origin or
a second genesis. And so, uh,

1209
01:11:02,840 --> 01:11:05,840
that might be one of those things that
happen 20 years from now when we find it.

1210
01:11:05,900 --> 01:11:08,630
And then we get all excited and
we published our paper in nature,

1211
01:11:09,050 --> 01:11:12,800
and the next day is like, wait a
second, what did this guy come from?

1212
01:11:12,990 --> 01:11:15,540
And then we have to send another
mission to search for biochemistry.

1213
01:11:15,960 --> 01:11:19,800
And so I'd really matters how we think
about the search for life before we start

1214
01:11:19,801 --> 01:11:20,490
searching for it.

1215
01:11:20,490 --> 01:11:25,490
Because you can end up with many years
of time and money not spent the right

1216
01:11:25,981 --> 01:11:30,610
way. I'll still be happy if we
find a store model. Omar's, but

1217
01:11:33,270 --> 01:11:34,103
yeah.
Thank you.

1218
01:11:34,350 --> 01:11:38,680
[inaudible].
