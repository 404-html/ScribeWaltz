1
00:00:08,550 --> 00:00:12,540
[inaudible]

2
00:00:13,320 --> 00:00:14,580
wow.
Full House.

3
00:00:14,581 --> 00:00:18,630
It's great to great to be here and
it's real privilege and honor for me to

4
00:00:18,631 --> 00:00:21,640
introduce that then evil now, uh, to uh,

5
00:00:21,660 --> 00:00:26,520
to Google and a two deep mind to come and
talk to us about his amazing new movie

6
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:31,260
blade runner, 2049. So, um,
I'm sure like many of you,

7
00:00:31,261 --> 00:00:35,330
blade runner is actually one of my
favorite films of all time. Probably my,

8
00:00:35,380 --> 00:00:37,740
my absolute favorite.
And uh,

9
00:00:37,741 --> 00:00:40,830
it's actually one of the main reasons
I got into AI in the first place when I

10
00:00:40,831 --> 00:00:43,200
saw that when I was a
sort of, um, teenager,

11
00:00:43,201 --> 00:00:46,170
young teenager made such
an impression on me. Um,

12
00:00:46,230 --> 00:00:49,590
and how amazing sort of Ai
was portrayed in the film. Uh,

13
00:00:49,630 --> 00:00:52,440
that's why I ended up doing
my whole career on it. And a,

14
00:00:52,441 --> 00:00:57,441
I'm also a huge fan of will work
a sicario arrival prisoners.

15
00:00:57,451 --> 00:01:00,720
I'm sure you've all seen these films.
It's amazing film director, so,

16
00:01:00,721 --> 00:01:03,340
so excited to hear that he was going to,
um,

17
00:01:03,540 --> 00:01:08,470
take the helm for the new blade
runner film. So welcome you. So, um,

18
00:01:08,550 --> 00:01:13,450
how did you approach, you know,
sort of trying to, uh, build,

19
00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:16,380
do a sequel to something that
was so iconic with, you know,

20
00:01:16,381 --> 00:01:20,790
all the legions of fans out
there, something that the,
you know, such big fans of,

21
00:01:20,791 --> 00:01:21,840
how did you approach that?

22
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:25,830
Well, first of all, I have to see that
before I start. I must say that I'm very,

23
00:01:25,831 --> 00:01:30,810
I feel very on in front of you, everybody,
because you're all experts, you know,

24
00:01:30,811 --> 00:01:35,620
in science is, uh, and, uh, in
the AI, most of you I think, and,

25
00:01:35,621 --> 00:01:39,230
uh, me, I'm just a
filmmaker. I'm just seeing,

26
00:01:39,270 --> 00:01:42,860
I don't think I have
something you, I, I, I can,

27
00:01:42,890 --> 00:01:46,640
I'm happy to be with you to
share my experience about
the making of blade runner

28
00:01:47,150 --> 00:01:50,900
2049 with you today. But I don't think
you will learn anything. And matured.

29
00:01:54,050 --> 00:01:58,310
I'm feeling a bit nervous,
but about, about the, the,

30
00:01:58,311 --> 00:02:01,540
um, no, the, the first of all, when the,

31
00:02:01,550 --> 00:02:05,240
I heard that a Ridley Scott that uh,

32
00:02:05,330 --> 00:02:08,180
and glucose over the Broderick
Johnson from outcome.

33
00:02:08,750 --> 00:02:11,750
We're a bar,
uh,

34
00:02:12,470 --> 00:02:17,470
starting a project that will be a
followup to the first blade runner.

35
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:23,060
The first time I heard about it, I
said to myself, wow, what an insane,

36
00:02:23,630 --> 00:02:26,650
it's wrong. Beautiful
grade. Bad idea. Yeah.

37
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:30,200
Because it's like,
as I like you,

38
00:02:30,201 --> 00:02:33,560
the first movies where is by far one
of my favorite one is a movie that is

39
00:02:33,561 --> 00:02:37,940
linked to the my birth of love to cinema.
I mean,

40
00:02:37,941 --> 00:02:40,850
the way I started to
dream to be a director.

41
00:02:42,290 --> 00:02:45,360
So it's like a church,
you know. And uh, um,

42
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,910
and the thing is that what convinced
me was the screenplay when I read the

43
00:02:49,911 --> 00:02:52,960
screenplay, when I had the chance
to read the screenplay, uh,

44
00:02:52,961 --> 00:02:56,530
the screenplay was written at risk
by entered venture was the, the,

45
00:02:56,940 --> 00:03:01,450
the writer of original movie
came with a very strong,

46
00:03:01,960 --> 00:03:06,170
strong ideas, a very strong biome.
And then, uh, uh, and it, it, it,

47
00:03:06,200 --> 00:03:09,640
you work in collaboration with release
holds from the start that secures meal

48
00:03:09,641 --> 00:03:14,641
that the idea that the both
fathers were at the element of the,

49
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:16,150
of the project.

50
00:03:16,150 --> 00:03:20,020
And then Michael Greene came on board
and made a very strong stream. And, um,

51
00:03:20,920 --> 00:03:24,010
um, from there, uh,

52
00:03:24,070 --> 00:03:29,020
all the pressure was before I
took the decisions because I'm

53
00:03:32,020 --> 00:03:35,900
like, add to talk with Ryan Gosling at
one point that we'll resume the, the, the,

54
00:03:35,901 --> 00:03:38,310
the spirit of the journey's,
uh,

55
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:41,410
we said to ourselves both to
together at the beginning when,

56
00:03:41,411 --> 00:03:43,750
when decided both to do it is that,
uh,

57
00:03:44,050 --> 00:03:49,030
our chances of success were very narrow.
It was like a,

58
00:03:49,660 --> 00:03:53,530
and to accept that, that, uh,
no matter what we will do,

59
00:03:53,531 --> 00:03:57,550
we knew that we will come be compared
to a masterpiece and a movie that

60
00:03:57,551 --> 00:04:00,540
everybody loved. And, uh, that, uh,

61
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:04,930
people will come in theaters with baseball
bats, you know, and, and by the way,

62
00:04:04,931 --> 00:04:06,140
if I,
uh,

63
00:04:06,230 --> 00:04:11,160
am a huge fan f if the movie had been
done by someone else, I will add,

64
00:04:12,270 --> 00:04:15,790
I'll be the same and I will
go in there. And, and, um,

65
00:04:16,480 --> 00:04:20,320
knowing that it gave us, and when
you accept that you accept that fate,

66
00:04:20,860 --> 00:04:23,760
then you become free. And,
and, and it's a very, uh,

67
00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:29,040
so you're not bound to success or you're
not thinking about the result you're

68
00:04:29,651 --> 00:04:34,480
taking, thinking about creating
a pure artistic act. And,

69
00:04:34,510 --> 00:04:35,550
uh,

70
00:04:36,460 --> 00:04:40,150
and I think everybody shares the same
pressure on the crew from Roger Deakins to

71
00:04:40,151 --> 00:04:43,030
Dennis Gassner, to all the people
that worked on the movie, that we all

72
00:04:44,650 --> 00:04:45,670
felt that pressure.

73
00:04:45,671 --> 00:04:49,570
And the other on the way to work on that
with that pressure was to get rid of it

74
00:04:49,571 --> 00:04:52,270
by,
by accepting that fact.

75
00:04:53,860 --> 00:04:57,430
How much creative input did he
have once the filming style?

76
00:05:00,250 --> 00:05:03,340
Uh, you, at the beginning, it
was supposed to direct it and,

77
00:05:03,341 --> 00:05:08,140
and it didn't for a simple reason is that
he was too busy. He has a schedule, a,

78
00:05:08,610 --> 00:05:11,730
uh, a lot of projects
in his mind. And, uh,

79
00:05:11,820 --> 00:05:16,520
and the other way on the other
end Arison for, let's face it,

80
00:05:16,521 --> 00:05:21,040
there's no spring chicken. I
mean, he's like, he wanted to, uh,

81
00:05:21,070 --> 00:05:22,480
shoot soon.
You know,

82
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:27,350
Andy [inaudible],

83
00:05:29,670 --> 00:05:33,340
the sprinkler was ready. Arison
loved the screenplay. And,

84
00:05:33,410 --> 00:05:35,340
and so that's where I came on board.

85
00:05:35,540 --> 00:05:40,540
And so the input or of release is huge
because he created the screenplay.

86
00:05:41,130 --> 00:05:45,030
He wrote the screenplay with the Hampton
and Michael. So that's huge, you know,

87
00:05:45,031 --> 00:05:49,310
and, and, uh, is a, at the birth
of the ideas. So their mom,

88
00:05:49,350 --> 00:05:52,440
they're from there. When I met
him an immediate to get on board,

89
00:05:52,441 --> 00:05:56,370
I needed his blessing. That was one of
my, let's say, conditions to get on board.

90
00:05:56,371 --> 00:06:00,770
I need, I need meet the man, look at
him in the eyes and say, is it okay?

91
00:06:01,340 --> 00:06:06,190
Because, and, and, and I was
very gracious, very a gentleman,

92
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:07,130
very,
um,

93
00:06:08,450 --> 00:06:09,283
uh,

94
00:06:10,020 --> 00:06:13,520
you welcome me. Uh, says, uh,

95
00:06:13,550 --> 00:06:16,360
that he was happy that I
will do it. And He, um,

96
00:06:17,070 --> 00:06:18,080
uh,

97
00:06:19,270 --> 00:06:23,560
basically gave me all the
elements that, uh, the genesis,

98
00:06:23,561 --> 00:06:25,960
what was behind the first
movie. We're all, all the, the,

99
00:06:26,170 --> 00:06:29,380
the source of inspirations,
the background,

100
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:33,610
the context of the first
movie and, and what, uh,

101
00:06:33,640 --> 00:06:37,960
what was behind it. And, uh, but
for this one, he said, it's yours.

102
00:06:38,050 --> 00:06:41,110
You're totally free. If you need me, I'll
be at the end, at the end of the phone.

103
00:06:41,111 --> 00:06:44,320
But otherwise, I, I,
uh, you're totally free.

104
00:06:44,820 --> 00:06:49,030
He gave me what we say in French catalog.
Launch means it's my movie.

105
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:51,580
It's my responsibility. So if
you don't like, is it my fault?

106
00:06:52,110 --> 00:06:54,410
It has nothing to and,
and uh,

107
00:06:55,230 --> 00:06:58,540
the only way I was able to work
is to work with Ridley B and me.

108
00:06:58,610 --> 00:07:02,770
We'll let been totally impossible.
We've always away at the time,

109
00:07:02,771 --> 00:07:06,950
I think it was doing primitives very far
away. I was very, the only way it was, uh,

110
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:10,150
that, uh, I'm very grateful because
that was very generous of him.

111
00:07:10,300 --> 00:07:14,530
So did he already have this idea in mind
when he was doing the original film or,

112
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:18,470
or of a sequel or what the sequel would
be about or when did that come about?

113
00:07:19,320 --> 00:07:22,870
I heard different stories about that.
I know, I remember he told me that, uh,

114
00:07:23,500 --> 00:07:25,300
at one point,
you know,

115
00:07:25,301 --> 00:07:30,301
the original blade runner was born at
the time where there was star wars and

116
00:07:31,530 --> 00:07:33,550
Indiana Jones,
all the birth of those sequels.

117
00:07:33,551 --> 00:07:37,750
And I know that really was like a really
loved the first hours and you will,

118
00:07:37,751 --> 00:07:41,830
in fact, it was traumatized
when you saw it was like, Oh
God, it's so good. It's so,

119
00:07:42,260 --> 00:07:43,093
yeah.

120
00:07:44,030 --> 00:07:44,863
Um,

121
00:07:48,480 --> 00:07:50,010
I think the idea,

122
00:07:50,011 --> 00:07:53,850
there was an idea at the time that it
could have done a SQL with that character.

123
00:07:53,851 --> 00:07:57,540
He was seeing, he knew that
the universe was, was bigger.

124
00:07:57,840 --> 00:08:01,230
It's just that the way or the production
and the, there was, it was not possible.

125
00:08:01,350 --> 00:08:05,550
It just took the skills of a producer,
the outcome to be able to,

126
00:08:06,540 --> 00:08:08,640
it was like basically
the rights of the movie.

127
00:08:08,641 --> 00:08:10,700
We're in that kind of
no man's land war zone.

128
00:08:10,701 --> 00:08:12,960
It actually put it all together yet to,
it was a kind of,

129
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:18,120
what process did you go through to make
it your own universe and your own story.

130
00:08:18,791 --> 00:08:20,190
And that's the thing is that it's,

131
00:08:20,220 --> 00:08:25,220
it was where it took a lot of time
and meditation to be able to make my,

132
00:08:25,351 --> 00:08:28,320
uh, you know, it's a thing to
make a movie. It's a lot of work,

133
00:08:28,321 --> 00:08:29,850
but to take someone else's dream,

134
00:08:30,060 --> 00:08:33,930
to take someone else's characters
to aesthetics, it's like a,

135
00:08:33,931 --> 00:08:37,650
so the way to do it,
it's like I started by saying to myself,

136
00:08:38,960 --> 00:08:43,650
it was a 2049 as I kind of love
letter with the original blade runner.

137
00:08:44,130 --> 00:08:46,860
I mean, I, um, we decided that, I say we,

138
00:08:46,861 --> 00:08:49,830
because I started that right at the
beginning to work with Roger Deakins.

139
00:08:49,831 --> 00:08:54,030
I brought in on board quite early this
time because I was doing finishing

140
00:08:54,031 --> 00:08:58,230
arrival at the time and I needed
this input is a wisdom is uh,

141
00:08:58,290 --> 00:09:01,830
his ideas right at the start.
It was such a huge task.

142
00:09:01,860 --> 00:09:04,470
So I needed a close partner
from the start and uh,

143
00:09:04,740 --> 00:09:08,400
we spent several weeks in Montreal
in a hotel room with a storyboard,

144
00:09:08,410 --> 00:09:11,760
artists to start to draw
to, to, to interpret,

145
00:09:11,761 --> 00:09:15,450
to transform the screenplay into a,
into a movie there together.

146
00:09:15,930 --> 00:09:20,550
So I will say that it's by far a very, the
movie you, I was denied from the start,

147
00:09:20,580 --> 00:09:25,290
you know, it's a very, very strong input
in the movie. Um, the idea was that,

148
00:09:25,291 --> 00:09:29,150
uh, I, uh, when you are, uh, uh, with the,

149
00:09:29,190 --> 00:09:30,570
I'm working with someone whose story,

150
00:09:30,571 --> 00:09:34,470
I always try to find an intimate
way to get into the story too,

151
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:38,630
to have to create an intimate
link. And one of them, it's,

152
00:09:38,631 --> 00:09:40,690
it's going to sound trivial for you,

153
00:09:41,190 --> 00:09:46,020
but it was huge for me too to
aesthetically it was the climate and the

154
00:09:46,050 --> 00:09:48,770
screenplay was different than the
first movie. It was more like a,

155
00:09:49,470 --> 00:09:52,440
there was the idea that uh,
they will be snow,

156
00:09:52,770 --> 00:09:54,870
it will be winter will be present.
And I mean,

157
00:09:54,970 --> 00:09:59,290
I mean as a Canadian there's one thing I
know about this that they can deal with

158
00:09:59,291 --> 00:10:02,180
and it, it has a strong influence
and strong impact on the line,

159
00:10:02,700 --> 00:10:05,780
right on the atmospheres
and, and, and the two.

160
00:10:05,781 --> 00:10:10,781
So to approach Ridley's universe
through the lens of something that is so

161
00:10:11,181 --> 00:10:15,260
familiar to me, it helped
me to, to define, uh,

162
00:10:15,650 --> 00:10:19,250
what I will keep from the first movie
and what I will answer and what I will

163
00:10:19,251 --> 00:10:24,050
create different to make it my own. And
climate was a strong thing, I will say.

164
00:10:24,440 --> 00:10:27,520
Yeah. Yeah. I mean it has such a strong
style. The first deadline, I mean,

165
00:10:27,521 --> 00:10:28,680
one of the landscape.

166
00:10:28,690 --> 00:10:32,260
Then one thing I always found interesting
about it was this juxtaposition

167
00:10:32,261 --> 00:10:34,990
between very modern technology.

168
00:10:34,991 --> 00:10:37,450
Obviously the replicants
themselves flying cars,

169
00:10:37,630 --> 00:10:41,560
but also combined with quite
old technology like pay phones.

170
00:10:41,800 --> 00:10:45,370
And even the void camp machine
was very analog, right?

171
00:10:45,371 --> 00:10:48,520
So there was a sort of
combination of analog,

172
00:10:48,521 --> 00:10:52,600
quite old things and very modern things.
As I was doing the movie,

173
00:10:52,660 --> 00:10:57,460
sometimes I was feeling I was more doing
a period movie then the Scifi movie

174
00:10:58,090 --> 00:11:00,200
because you guys are so ahead,

175
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:05,950
you make our lives very difficult
to, it's iPhone. It's like it's a,

176
00:11:06,010 --> 00:11:08,300
it's very often and there's a lot of uh,
uh,

177
00:11:08,380 --> 00:11:10,240
work that is done to date that is virtual,

178
00:11:10,241 --> 00:11:13,100
that it's abstract that
for story telling and the,

179
00:11:13,101 --> 00:11:16,260
and the also technology make a job.

180
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:18,640
The detective stories quite
boring, you know, okay,

181
00:11:18,641 --> 00:11:23,140
I'm going to find something to take
a keyboard. And Yeah. So it's like,

182
00:11:23,141 --> 00:11:23,980
it's like we need that.

183
00:11:23,981 --> 00:11:27,280
There's nothing more boring for director
then to shoot a character in front of a

184
00:11:27,281 --> 00:11:32,230
screen. Yeah. As I can. So the
screenwriter, I had the brilliant idea.

185
00:11:32,490 --> 00:11:35,100
Uh, I thought, uh, I love
this idea because it,

186
00:11:35,101 --> 00:11:40,080
it created a landscape that allowed
me to create a, an adventure,

187
00:11:40,081 --> 00:11:43,730
which is that it's the thing that
I can talk about is that in the,

188
00:11:43,731 --> 00:11:46,260
in between the first movie, in the
second one, there was an event, uh,

189
00:11:46,350 --> 00:11:49,770
emp that created a blackout,

190
00:11:49,860 --> 00:11:54,370
which is that you many dealers that data,
they lost the,

191
00:11:54,371 --> 00:11:56,890
the digital world went to,
I'm sorry guys,

192
00:11:57,680 --> 00:12:00,300
but
it happened.

193
00:12:04,030 --> 00:12:07,200
So the, the, there was the,
the, the world. In 2014,

194
00:12:07,430 --> 00:12:11,620
we went back to analog technology.
So we went back to the analog world.

195
00:12:12,070 --> 00:12:17,020
Where would they rely on, on, on, on,
on the, on the real, I'm concrete,

196
00:12:17,430 --> 00:12:20,750
not concrete. So what's, is
there a concrete translator?

197
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:25,450
Something that tangible, tangible
technology, analog technology.

198
00:12:25,510 --> 00:12:29,080
And that for me was a blessing because
it allowed my character to travel,

199
00:12:29,350 --> 00:12:31,930
to open doors, to rooms, to meet people.

200
00:12:32,140 --> 00:12:33,100
I got away from the screen.

201
00:12:34,010 --> 00:12:38,100
From the screen. Yeah. Yeah.
That's fantastic. And, uh, I'm,

202
00:12:38,120 --> 00:12:42,110
I'm about to make another Scifi movie
and my goal is to try to avoid screens

203
00:12:42,111 --> 00:12:45,890
again. So just to be in contact
with the reality more. Yup.

204
00:12:46,060 --> 00:12:47,950
Fantastic.
So another really important,

205
00:12:47,951 --> 00:12:52,450
I think I'm sort of pillar
of the atmosphere in the
first film was the music,

206
00:12:52,890 --> 00:12:56,790
you know, the, I think the Vangelis score
was kind of an amazing score and, and,

207
00:12:56,791 --> 00:12:59,230
and now she created a part,
a lot of the feeling of the film.

208
00:12:59,410 --> 00:13:00,770
How did you approach that

209
00:13:02,010 --> 00:13:02,360
very,

210
00:13:02,360 --> 00:13:07,070
very important element that it was
such a iconic score because it's,

211
00:13:07,071 --> 00:13:10,420
it's a, it was like, you know,
the landscape that we also in the,

212
00:13:10,421 --> 00:13:13,320
in the first movie war, so
this topic, this topic and,

213
00:13:13,321 --> 00:13:17,210
and Dystopian and a dark and depressive,

214
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:22,520
but on top of it, you had that beautiful
melancholic, Voitric, very delicate music,

215
00:13:22,521 --> 00:13:24,620
you know, with those, uh,

216
00:13:25,310 --> 00:13:28,690
dark spectral drums that were like a,

217
00:13:29,410 --> 00:13:34,200
created a kind of religious feeling
on top of it. And that is, uh, um,

218
00:13:34,430 --> 00:13:38,960
we did a lot of exploration, a lot of
exploration with music. But, uh, you know,

219
00:13:38,961 --> 00:13:42,700
when you do a blade runner movie,
you cannot go very far from the CSAD,

220
00:13:42,860 --> 00:13:46,610
which is the original synthesizer
that Angulus use. I know.

221
00:13:46,970 --> 00:13:50,690
And I insisted and I,
it's the thing that I,

222
00:13:50,691 --> 00:13:52,970
at one point I had to put
my feet up. I said, okay,

223
00:13:53,370 --> 00:13:57,020
we are going in that direction
as much as Roger and I, um,

224
00:13:57,680 --> 00:13:59,930
we are Roger Deakins
and I, we tried to, uh,

225
00:14:00,530 --> 00:14:04,250
make sure that some part of the movie
will be very close as typically to the

226
00:14:04,251 --> 00:14:06,650
first movie because
it's still a detective,

227
00:14:06,651 --> 00:14:08,270
Phil Moss Astarita Blade runner movie.

228
00:14:08,270 --> 00:14:11,230
You have to be in that kind of
zone aesthetic zone and, and,

229
00:14:11,240 --> 00:14:12,740
and is the same for the sound.

230
00:14:13,100 --> 00:14:18,100
So we work very hard to create that
sound soundtrack that will be as close to

231
00:14:18,831 --> 00:14:20,810
the sound effect, the big
like in the, so first one.

232
00:14:20,811 --> 00:14:24,770
And then the same time to have that kind
of Melancholia that is so beautiful and

233
00:14:24,771 --> 00:14:27,320
that very specifics on those,
those cs 80,

234
00:14:27,321 --> 00:14:31,290
there are beast and they are like really
impressive machines. Very delicate.

235
00:14:32,090 --> 00:14:35,750
And um, I'm very proud of the score. I'm a
see, that's the thing that, uh, you know,

236
00:14:35,751 --> 00:14:39,050
when you make a movie, I just
finished a movie few, few weeks ago,

237
00:14:39,660 --> 00:14:43,700
have no distance, but, um,
there's some elements of it that,

238
00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:48,800
and I know that the score, the Benwell
efficient and Zimmer did a fantastic job.

239
00:14:49,130 --> 00:14:50,300
Yeah.
I can't wait to hear that.

240
00:14:50,690 --> 00:14:53,370
So sounds like you're a big
fan of science fiction. I mean,

241
00:14:53,470 --> 00:14:56,870
you say you're doing another
science fiction film, but,
uh, it's interesting that,

242
00:14:57,140 --> 00:15:00,440
you know, as a, as an AI
practitioner, you know,

243
00:15:00,441 --> 00:15:05,120
often in films portrayal of Ai and
robots is usually sometimes negative and

244
00:15:05,121 --> 00:15:06,250
antagonistic.
You know,

245
00:15:06,260 --> 00:15:10,220
some notable exceptions like the robots
in interstellar tars and case they were

246
00:15:10,221 --> 00:15:11,054
fantastic.

247
00:15:11,270 --> 00:15:16,250
So I hope you produce some films with a
positive image of AI in the future. But,

248
00:15:16,251 --> 00:15:18,090
uh, yeah, but with the original,
yeah. But with industry,

249
00:15:18,100 --> 00:15:21,420
with the original blade runner were, you
know, the replicants where, you know,

250
00:15:21,470 --> 00:15:23,780
maybe they were the heroes of the film.
I was always thinking,

251
00:15:23,781 --> 00:15:27,420
do you feel like Ruca Hauer and boy
batsis carrots? It was actually the hero

252
00:15:27,950 --> 00:15:31,980
Ding that I think is, uh,
um, make the people, uh,

253
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:37,750
got the people confused about the first
finish that Harrison Ford who was at the

254
00:15:37,751 --> 00:15:42,190
time and solo in Indiana. John was
not a hero. It was a dark antihero.

255
00:15:42,690 --> 00:15:47,560
And then that was like very confusing for
people and that, uh, uh, no difficulty.

256
00:15:47,561 --> 00:15:50,710
The replicants are, they are a mirror
of ourselves, you know, they are like,

257
00:15:50,770 --> 00:15:53,900
they represent our anger to
our, our maker, you know,

258
00:15:53,990 --> 00:15:56,170
about our human condition.
Yeah.

259
00:15:56,210 --> 00:15:58,550
You know, I think one of the things
that we all fell in love with it,

260
00:15:58,551 --> 00:15:59,550
the first blade runner and,

261
00:15:59,551 --> 00:16:02,660
and I'm sure you're continuing the you
felt is it's not really a film about

262
00:16:02,661 --> 00:16:03,950
technology in some ways,
right?

263
00:16:03,951 --> 00:16:08,630
It's actually about philosophy and deeper
things like consciousness, identity.

264
00:16:08,870 --> 00:16:12,990
Um, and you know what it
means to be alive. Mortality.
I think that's what it is.

265
00:16:13,380 --> 00:16:17,620
It's, it's a, it's a, um, I
wouldn't say that, uh, again,

266
00:16:17,720 --> 00:16:21,460
uh, that, uh, we, we respected that,

267
00:16:21,461 --> 00:16:25,880
that spirit in the second one. It's like
the, the technology is there to, uh,

268
00:16:26,080 --> 00:16:30,730
create a more dynamic story, but it's not
a, it's not, um, in the foreground at all.

269
00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:35,530
Uh, it's, uh, I will say it's,
it's a, it's there to be exciting,

270
00:16:35,531 --> 00:16:37,990
but still the core of the
movie's about humanity,

271
00:16:37,991 --> 00:16:42,991
what it means to be a human or as human
in some ways we are program ourselves

272
00:16:43,180 --> 00:16:45,620
from our, um, education and,

273
00:16:45,621 --> 00:16:48,250
and from our agentic
background and the owl,

274
00:16:48,310 --> 00:16:51,930
can we get free and, uh, out, uh,

275
00:16:52,310 --> 00:16:54,740
can we get out of the
road? Can we, can we,

276
00:16:54,980 --> 00:16:59,060
can we get free and get rid
of that background and get,

277
00:16:59,840 --> 00:17:02,820
I have more freedom, you know, and
that's the way I see the movie right now.

278
00:17:03,050 --> 00:17:06,510
Movies about broken dreams too, which
is very melancholic and uh, yeah,

279
00:17:06,580 --> 00:17:08,030
it was a beautiful Megan.
Kalia that,

280
00:17:08,420 --> 00:17:12,190
that was the main thing I was trying to
protect, but to have the same kind of, uh,

281
00:17:12,870 --> 00:17:14,330
yeah. Beautiful. See,

282
00:17:14,660 --> 00:17:18,200
yeah. I mean the, the, the, the blade
runner seems to suggest that, um,

283
00:17:18,510 --> 00:17:22,190
the difference between replicants
and humans was sort of the emotional

284
00:17:22,191 --> 00:17:23,720
empathetic side.
Right.

285
00:17:23,721 --> 00:17:26,810
And that's how I do have memories
and having episodic memory,

286
00:17:26,811 --> 00:17:28,610
a memory of your past.
Uh,

287
00:17:28,611 --> 00:17:32,060
and I guess another thing it seems to
suggest was that the longer the replicants

288
00:17:32,061 --> 00:17:34,520
lived, the more emotions
they would sort of develop.

289
00:17:34,550 --> 00:17:39,230
So hence the termination date. But,
um, you know, what if, I don't,

290
00:17:39,231 --> 00:17:40,490
if you're exploring this in the new fan,

291
00:17:40,491 --> 00:17:43,580
but what if they do live longer and they
do develop emotions and feelings and

292
00:17:43,581 --> 00:17:46,760
empathy, would there be much difference
in your opinion then of you know,

293
00:17:46,770 --> 00:17:48,920
retiring a replicant and killing a human?
Yeah,

294
00:17:49,060 --> 00:17:53,720
but the thing is that, uh, if in
the first movie that the, the,

295
00:17:53,721 --> 00:17:55,380
the thing is that they were,
they were the,

296
00:17:55,381 --> 00:17:58,570
the fact that they had a
little short term life,

297
00:17:58,600 --> 00:18:02,850
they developed a anger toward
them, their maker. And the,

298
00:18:02,860 --> 00:18:04,640
in the second movie I can say that,
uh,

299
00:18:04,660 --> 00:18:08,980
of course like the
screenwriter used to say to me,

300
00:18:08,981 --> 00:18:13,280
it's like if a company developed an
iPad that was able to kill people, you,

301
00:18:13,281 --> 00:18:15,930
you will try to find a solution
before selling another high patio.

302
00:18:16,230 --> 00:18:20,850
You will try to find out a
new way to create. So, so
the, the definitely the, the,

303
00:18:20,851 --> 00:18:24,690
the, the, they are new replicants
and their movie that I'd been, uh,

304
00:18:24,910 --> 00:18:27,850
with a longer lifespan
because if you think about it,

305
00:18:27,851 --> 00:18:30,970
if they didn't have a longer lifespan,
30 years later,

306
00:18:30,971 --> 00:18:33,430
there will be no more more problems.
So it means that the ad,

307
00:18:33,490 --> 00:18:37,420
the ad created a new line
of replicants with, uh, uh,

308
00:18:38,280 --> 00:18:41,140
longterm, uh, and that,
uh, but what that was not,

309
00:18:41,590 --> 00:18:43,390
that didn't solve all the problems.

310
00:18:43,870 --> 00:18:48,870
And because there's always
that strong pressure,

311
00:18:48,941 --> 00:18:52,170
that strong [inaudible]
that came from a conditions.

312
00:18:52,171 --> 00:18:54,610
So if you're human or bioengineer human,

313
00:18:54,611 --> 00:18:59,340
you are still dealing with this fact
that you don't know why you are on place.

314
00:18:59,341 --> 00:19:02,410
And, uh, and the fact
that the basic, the also,

315
00:19:02,530 --> 00:19:05,290
there's another factor is that
they replicants are designed to be,

316
00:19:06,100 --> 00:19:11,000
they are basically designed
to be slaves. So the, the,

317
00:19:11,230 --> 00:19:14,370
I think that in the second movie
is more about being citizens, uh,

318
00:19:14,460 --> 00:19:19,380
considered as a real citizens.
That is one of them. The

319
00:19:20,900 --> 00:19:23,630
main topic of, yeah, yeah,
yeah. So it, so as an artist,

320
00:19:23,631 --> 00:19:28,130
you do you feel that there are some
aspects of humanity and being human that

321
00:19:28,131 --> 00:19:29,300
could never be simulated,

322
00:19:31,400 --> 00:19:32,233
uh,

323
00:19:32,410 --> 00:19:36,330
artificially,
would you say

324
00:19:38,340 --> 00:19:39,250
helped me.
Okay.

325
00:19:41,530 --> 00:19:46,060
Uh, it's, it's, um, you know, it's like,

326
00:19:46,061 --> 00:19:49,610
it's like the complexity of humanity
that, uh, uh, that struggle too,

327
00:19:49,790 --> 00:19:52,470
uh, to, uh,

328
00:19:54,580 --> 00:19:59,260
get rid of the voices that
are coming from, uh, the past.

329
00:19:59,261 --> 00:20:04,050
You know, that I think we can't recreate
with an AI that, uh, that, that,

330
00:20:04,090 --> 00:20:08,890
uh, the fact that, uh,
my weakness right now,

331
00:20:09,850 --> 00:20:14,830
how do you recreate that? And those
weakness are very complex products

332
00:20:15,710 --> 00:20:17,000
of my,

333
00:20:18,010 --> 00:20:20,410
the education I received them
from what the experience,

334
00:20:20,450 --> 00:20:24,500
the gift that I received from
the parents to the generation,

335
00:20:24,660 --> 00:20:29,410
the generations, you know? Yeah.
That had to be held your problem.

336
00:20:29,680 --> 00:20:34,300
Okay. So one, one of the, I
mean, I think the last scene of,

337
00:20:34,600 --> 00:20:37,810
of, uh, of blade runner was one of
my, I mean, probably one of the,

338
00:20:37,870 --> 00:20:41,770
I would say one of the greatest teams in
all of cinema, uh, with, with Roy Batty.

339
00:20:42,040 --> 00:20:46,330
And He, you know, he house
sort of releases the delve
into the air as he dies.

340
00:20:46,331 --> 00:20:48,010
Do you think, what do
think that symbolizes? I

341
00:20:48,010 --> 00:20:52,030
always thought that symbolized that
the applicant felt he had a soul.

342
00:20:53,140 --> 00:20:56,740
Is that what you read? That's the
way I read it through. And it's a,

343
00:20:56,741 --> 00:20:59,100
it's a beautiful, uh, uh,

344
00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:02,290
it's a beautiful image image.

345
00:21:02,320 --> 00:21:05,780
And what I love also about this image
is that it came from Rutger Hauer. Yeah,

346
00:21:06,430 --> 00:21:09,820
I love it.
I love it when actors bring strong,

347
00:21:10,180 --> 00:21:13,180
strong ideas on, on the, uh,

348
00:21:13,210 --> 00:21:17,120
when an actor is like [inaudible]
and golf like totally, uh,

349
00:21:18,110 --> 00:21:20,840
that, uh, in position of his, uh,

350
00:21:20,841 --> 00:21:25,480
his character in all good actors,
strong actors,

351
00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:29,990
they can become and they brings
strong ideas. And I had the same, uh,

352
00:21:30,130 --> 00:21:34,850
experience with Ryan Gosling,
brought some very strong ideas on the,

353
00:21:34,851 --> 00:21:36,940
on the, there are some scenes
that I'm very proud of them.

354
00:21:36,950 --> 00:21:39,690
The scene in the movies that honestly,
uh,

355
00:21:39,940 --> 00:21:43,360
one of my best cover it seen as
a Ryan Gosling idea. You know,

356
00:21:44,040 --> 00:21:46,160
your actors to improvise.
I deeply love it.

357
00:21:46,570 --> 00:21:49,570
I love when I'm from the
documentary where, uh,

358
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:53,680
the thing I love about documentary is
like you put your camera in life and

359
00:21:53,720 --> 00:21:55,600
suddenly sometime life organizes itself.

360
00:21:55,601 --> 00:21:57,910
There was an accident in front
of the camera to create a strong

361
00:21:59,740 --> 00:22:03,520
cinematic moment in from a cinematic
poetry in front of the camera. And I,

362
00:22:03,550 --> 00:22:06,650
that we, I, I find it
back in the fiction is a,

363
00:22:06,700 --> 00:22:11,170
with actors and there's nothing more
exciting for me than when an actor come on

364
00:22:11,171 --> 00:22:14,050
set and say, I didn't sleep,
had this idea and I have this,

365
00:22:14,051 --> 00:22:18,920
I have to try this idea that I love.
Yeah. And I know that there is that same,

366
00:22:18,921 --> 00:22:23,920
which Roger Deakins we,
we tried to create to be ready.

367
00:22:23,921 --> 00:22:26,830
We had, the movie is very a
storyboard. Everything is planned,

368
00:22:26,860 --> 00:22:31,860
but we always keep a space and set to
make sure that the actors have the space

369
00:22:32,921 --> 00:22:35,140
to recreate something
that was not planned,

370
00:22:35,500 --> 00:22:38,530
that the would always link with
the scene of course. But it's,

371
00:22:38,570 --> 00:22:41,170
there's nothing more
exciting for me than that,

372
00:22:41,171 --> 00:22:44,680
than an idea that was not
expecting that surprise me. That's,

373
00:22:44,860 --> 00:22:48,130
I call it the chaos of life.
You know that and it's like,

374
00:22:48,580 --> 00:22:52,920
that's why I think that
computer generated the uh,

375
00:22:53,920 --> 00:22:56,050
characters are always,

376
00:22:56,380 --> 00:23:01,380
most of the time they are created by
people be on the camera that they don't

377
00:23:01,511 --> 00:23:03,070
have.
They cannot create that spontaneous,

378
00:23:03,290 --> 00:23:06,850
those accidents that brings
sparks of life and the surprise.

379
00:23:06,851 --> 00:23:11,800
And that's why we are where
we are becoming. So, uh,
uh, surprise and excite the,

380
00:23:11,801 --> 00:23:14,680
as an audience member that we,
that's why he snuck and evolve.

381
00:23:15,010 --> 00:23:18,190
That's where cinema can evolve this when
we catch live in front of the camera.

382
00:23:18,850 --> 00:23:20,680
And now there's some
moments like that in the,

383
00:23:20,681 --> 00:23:23,310
in the several moments
like that in Berlin,

384
00:23:23,410 --> 00:23:26,480
blade runner 2049 and those are
going to that by favorite ones.

385
00:23:26,980 --> 00:23:30,820
I can't imagine that film with that route
to have a sort of and providing those

386
00:23:30,821 --> 00:23:34,620
last lines. I think those words. Exactly,
exactly. Exactly. Exactly. Exactly. Yeah.

387
00:23:34,890 --> 00:23:38,110
Yeah. And that's one of, one of the
reason why also I love real sets,

388
00:23:38,140 --> 00:23:42,100
real an environment that we constructed
the sets and stimulates that and the

389
00:23:42,130 --> 00:23:45,680
actor's actor can focus on
is the interior and not on,

390
00:23:45,681 --> 00:23:50,170
I'm not trying to imagine and to be in
relationship with something that is a

391
00:23:50,171 --> 00:23:53,750
virtual. Yeah. That's why I had not like
green screens. I like real environments.

392
00:23:53,760 --> 00:23:55,310
Yeah. Fantastic. Well, we should,

393
00:23:55,311 --> 00:23:57,320
I'm sure there's many a
questions from the audience.

394
00:23:57,321 --> 00:24:00,590
We should open it up to the audience
for questions. Please. I should be,

395
00:24:00,591 --> 00:24:02,540
we should have some mics around the place.
So

396
00:24:03,070 --> 00:24:07,400
am I allowed to ask a question
about arrival? Yes, I think so.

397
00:24:10,690 --> 00:24:14,390
Um, so, uh, uh, so yes, yes, yes, yes.

398
00:24:15,840 --> 00:24:19,780
So arrival, uh, amazing.
That was my baseball,

399
00:24:19,870 --> 00:24:21,750
but moment,
uh,

400
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:26,890
the tet young short story stories
are alive is so, so impactful,

401
00:24:26,891 --> 00:24:30,900
so beautiful. And I wanted
to, but it's so tied up in,

402
00:24:31,380 --> 00:24:34,390
in language and the written word
and the way that he sort of,

403
00:24:35,120 --> 00:24:38,380
I don't know if everybody I know who's
read it yet, but go read it. It's awesome.

404
00:24:38,760 --> 00:24:42,340
Um, the way it's tied up in
language and the written word is so

405
00:24:43,870 --> 00:24:44,681
complicated.

406
00:24:44,681 --> 00:24:49,681
How did you approach turning the story
of time and language and how it affects

407
00:24:50,381 --> 00:24:53,140
the mind into something
that you could put on screen

408
00:24:55,270 --> 00:24:59,220
when you, when you do an adaptation? Um,

409
00:24:59,760 --> 00:25:03,390
it's a very violent, violent
process. You need to, to, uh,

410
00:25:03,900 --> 00:25:07,340
there's a brutal moment when you need
to destroy the original that the,

411
00:25:07,360 --> 00:25:11,610
I don't know if you read all the short
story from touching the story of your

412
00:25:11,611 --> 00:25:16,050
life. It's a little masterpiece.
It's a gem. And as you rightly said,

413
00:25:16,051 --> 00:25:17,310
it's like the,

414
00:25:17,311 --> 00:25:22,110
we play with language and time and
it's so beautiful and so clever and so

415
00:25:22,111 --> 00:25:26,370
brilliant to do a movie out of
it. It's like, it's like a, um,

416
00:25:26,730 --> 00:25:30,410
first of all, I, uh,
what I read it and, uh,

417
00:25:30,640 --> 00:25:32,930
produce referred me to, uh, to add up. Uh,

418
00:25:32,950 --> 00:25:37,680
I didn't knew how to because it
felt like, um, I said to them,

419
00:25:37,681 --> 00:25:42,180
it's like a fantastic story
and there's a movie there,

420
00:25:42,840 --> 00:25:43,441
but our,

421
00:25:43,441 --> 00:25:46,980
because it's a story about the process
of a repetitive process and intellectual

422
00:25:46,981 --> 00:25:51,300
process and uh, and uh, to find a
cinematic structure out of this.

423
00:25:51,780 --> 00:25:53,060
It took a screenwriter,

424
00:25:53,100 --> 00:25:57,110
Eric Icer that came on
board and created the Uhm,

425
00:25:57,480 --> 00:26:02,480
that find this idea of creating a tension
but the tension that was making it

426
00:26:04,471 --> 00:26:09,420
maybe more accessible story and um,
that was the key.

427
00:26:09,590 --> 00:26:14,050
Then, uh, um, the rest is a, is a,

428
00:26:14,051 --> 00:26:18,090
was a long process to, uh, to,
to the, the challenge of this,

429
00:26:18,091 --> 00:26:20,610
this movie was really to make sure that,

430
00:26:20,611 --> 00:26:23,780
because basically it's a teacher that
makes students, you know, and the,

431
00:26:23,781 --> 00:26:25,290
they are teaching a language together.

432
00:26:25,291 --> 00:26:30,000
So I'll do make this like a dynamic story
that will not feel repetitive and that

433
00:26:30,001 --> 00:26:30,920
will stay.
Uh,

434
00:26:32,010 --> 00:26:35,580
it took a long time in
the screenwriting process,

435
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:40,380
even in shooting and the movie transform
itself, not the main story, but the,

436
00:26:40,410 --> 00:26:45,290
the process to find the right rhythm, the
right elements. It was a, there is no,

437
00:26:45,390 --> 00:26:50,280
it's not a simple question. It's, it was
a puzzle to make them by far the longest,

438
00:26:50,730 --> 00:26:54,030
uh, editing, uh, sessions of my life,

439
00:26:54,031 --> 00:26:57,810
the most complex sessions and the, no,
it was not a given at the beginning.

440
00:26:57,811 --> 00:27:00,900
It was very, very difficult
movie to do. Yeah.

441
00:27:00,901 --> 00:27:05,400
We'll say bye. But that's a very
huge compliment coming. Thank you.

442
00:27:05,940 --> 00:27:06,773
Thank you.

443
00:27:08,290 --> 00:27:08,771
Viral,

444
00:27:08,771 --> 00:27:13,420
I believe at least six different cuts of
the original blade runner with in some

445
00:27:13,421 --> 00:27:18,130
cases they'll just be different at digs.
Did that make to your sequel difficult?

446
00:27:18,230 --> 00:27:23,100
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah. To make a,

447
00:27:23,160 --> 00:27:25,110
Yep. That's a good question.
The thing is that, uh,

448
00:27:25,140 --> 00:27:28,680
basically two between both fathers,
you know, because I listen for them.

449
00:27:28,730 --> 00:27:33,150
[inaudible] they still don't
agree about that. They still, uh,

450
00:27:34,740 --> 00:27:35,710
I found the,
the,

451
00:27:35,900 --> 00:27:40,900
the answer and a Phillip k Dick
Novel where the characters,

452
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:46,770
I love the idea of, uh, they are
doubting about themselves, the cups,

453
00:27:47,130 --> 00:27:49,320
the blade runners in the
Philip k. Dot. Dick novel.

454
00:27:49,321 --> 00:27:51,390
There are some time saying to themselves,

455
00:27:51,870 --> 00:27:55,020
maybe I should do the do the wife came
from myself because this morning I'm not

456
00:27:55,021 --> 00:27:58,230
sure if I'm human or not. You know,
it's like the, and I love this idea.

457
00:27:58,231 --> 00:28:03,231
I love the idea of keeping the question
alive to stand and walk the fine line,

458
00:28:05,460 --> 00:28:06,540
fine line of the doubt.

459
00:28:06,570 --> 00:28:10,590
And it's the thing that reassure me and
to start amped and venture wrote a story.

460
00:28:10,590 --> 00:28:15,540
The story of a 2049 is, is um, basically,

461
00:28:15,541 --> 00:28:19,890
uh, walk on this line is
decorated as a replicant or not.

462
00:28:20,070 --> 00:28:25,070
And I love the fact that the e s the
state on the question and not giving any

463
00:28:26,911 --> 00:28:31,620
answers, so it's, um, it's
released. God was sitting here,

464
00:28:31,740 --> 00:28:35,430
it will look at me and said, what the
hell he's talking about because he,

465
00:28:35,660 --> 00:28:38,380
he but me. I love the fact that, uh,

466
00:28:38,430 --> 00:28:43,410
the care does doubting about his own
identity even in is and isn't sure about

467
00:28:43,411 --> 00:28:47,940
that. That I love that. For me it's like
what does the part of the movie's about?

468
00:28:47,941 --> 00:28:48,540
Yeah.

469
00:28:48,540 --> 00:28:51,100
And then I was one of the questions I
want most wanted to ask you that she was,

470
00:28:51,101 --> 00:28:54,520
could you came up the third tier?
You know, mystery I had of when I,

471
00:28:54,580 --> 00:28:58,960
when I used to spend hours arguing with
my friends about was Deckerd a replicant

472
00:28:58,961 --> 00:29:02,770
and, but then the director's cut
seem to confirm in my opinion,

473
00:29:02,771 --> 00:29:07,240
for sure with the dream of the Unicorn
in his dream. And then they will unicorn,

474
00:29:07,580 --> 00:29:10,780
you know, Origami. So are you,
are you going to answer that?

475
00:29:10,781 --> 00:29:13,000
But then you show an age,
Irish and Harrison Ford.

476
00:29:13,001 --> 00:29:17,890
So then now it seems to suggest either
the replicants can age or, or, uh,

477
00:29:17,950 --> 00:29:19,790
he's not rapidly, you have
to watch the movie. Yeah.

478
00:29:19,860 --> 00:29:24,330
Right. So Do, do you actually answer
it all right? We, how can I say?

479
00:29:26,270 --> 00:29:29,960
The thing is that honestly, it's a thing
I can see without giving any spoilers,

480
00:29:29,961 --> 00:29:32,600
is that I think that, uh, again,

481
00:29:34,070 --> 00:29:36,920
questions create vertigo questions.

482
00:29:36,921 --> 00:29:39,890
Like why I love one of the reasons
I love Scifi because it's like, it,

483
00:29:40,010 --> 00:29:42,220
it allows you in a very dynamic,

484
00:29:42,220 --> 00:29:45,790
dynamic way to approach
existential questions are rubbish.

485
00:29:46,080 --> 00:29:47,890
Okay. And, and, and, uh,

486
00:29:47,891 --> 00:29:52,480
those existential question brings
you in contact with the unknown,

487
00:29:52,870 --> 00:29:55,870
which creates a beautiful vertigo.
And the, the question of the,

488
00:29:56,290 --> 00:30:01,290
the I love this feeling and it's
decorated as a human or not for me.

489
00:30:01,991 --> 00:30:05,580
I love the question.
The answer is less interesting.

490
00:30:05,720 --> 00:30:08,750
Yeah. You want to keep the tension.
Yeah. Yeah. She has a big part of it.

491
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:13,930
I read with views that Harrison Ford
and obviously it's famously, you know,

492
00:30:13,940 --> 00:30:15,980
he apparently didn't like the original,

493
00:30:15,981 --> 00:30:18,740
but is it just the different
interpretations of the original? Was that,

494
00:30:18,800 --> 00:30:20,360
what was the argument about or,

495
00:30:20,540 --> 00:30:24,190
cause presumably he does like
it cause I think that if,

496
00:30:24,210 --> 00:30:27,070
if a Irisin from a 100 students,
and I don't want to

497
00:30:27,220 --> 00:30:29,550
put words in his mouth,
but if you are asking me what,

498
00:30:29,560 --> 00:30:32,830
from what I understand is
that if felt that a man,

499
00:30:32,860 --> 00:30:35,470
a human being falling in love with,
with uh,

500
00:30:35,520 --> 00:30:40,520
an artificial human being was quite
poetic and strong and beautiful and rose a

501
00:30:40,691 --> 00:30:44,480
lot of questions, then
two androids, androids,

502
00:30:44,500 --> 00:30:45,850
but to replicants falling in love,

503
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:49,340
wanting to effect it was less
interesting for him. The idea that the,

504
00:30:49,470 --> 00:30:53,560
and I think that when he,
for him,

505
00:30:53,561 --> 00:30:57,470
when he shot the movie as an actor,
he played it as a human. I mean,

506
00:30:57,500 --> 00:31:01,270
he has a different reaction. He has a,
he's like a, he has different qualities.

507
00:31:01,271 --> 00:31:05,500
He has different, uh, and it was very,
and it drove him through all this.

508
00:31:05,501 --> 00:31:08,640
So when he learned later that he was
maybe a replicant, I think it's a what

509
00:31:10,250 --> 00:31:11,083
and the

510
00:31:11,880 --> 00:31:16,220
still to this days, but me,
I love the together. I mean,

511
00:31:16,280 --> 00:31:20,930
I think the other tough shoot. Yeah. I
think that the deeply respect each other.

512
00:31:21,040 --> 00:31:22,820
Yeah. And, and, uh,

513
00:31:23,010 --> 00:31:27,510
maybe that tension is what
made it so great actually.
Tension between agree. Yes.

514
00:31:27,511 --> 00:31:30,540
Yes, definitely. Well, listen, that, I
think that's all we got time for today,

515
00:31:30,541 --> 00:31:34,260
but I'm so looking forward to seeing the
new film and maybe getting some answers

516
00:31:34,300 --> 00:31:37,370
or some more questions. Thank
you everybody. Thank you.

517
00:31:37,810 --> 00:31:42,810
[inaudible].
