Speaker 1:          00:08          We are here today to talk with Tony and chain of voltaic systems. Um, and I'm going to give you first a little bit of background. So first is, um, at maker faire last year, um, I had my solar powered bike home, which, you know, does not power my ride to work, although that's version three. Um, when it does is it avoids the problem that was happening. Whereas I kept getting almost hit on coming up to bridge the Williamsburg Bridge because I never put the batteries in my lights because you know, batteries wear out and then I'm just too busy and distract the decks. You replaced them. Some wife said, come on, genius, you should, we'll lose somebody about this. So I found this lovely solar, I went through with several panels, found this lovely solar panel and put some yellow tape and a headlight on and now I didn't have that excuse anymore.

Speaker 1:          00:54          And the mantra achieve, um, efficiencies. What were my morning commute in, in the sun, powered my evening commute home in the dark and all of as well. So I was at a maker faire showing this off and Tony walked up to him just like very innocently and quite quite dust slyly as really, hey, what panel is that? I said, you know, I went through like I think four different panels, did some very crude but effective testing and this was the best one for efficiency per square centimeter of servicing. It's like, that's great to hear. Where did you get, I said eight 40 goals. That's really great to hear. I'm Tony from voltaic systems. That's my panel. And um, we went back and forth a little bit with the actual finished, he wants to say best one I've found and I did try like at least four.

Speaker 1:          01:38          I remember, um, he even gave me a free panel for being such a loyal, loyal fan. And I'm a big fan of this. If you have never heard this quote, really Tesla said it best. The Sun is the spring that drives all right. Electricity coming down and a wall came maybe from a hydroelectric plant that was powered by water falling down, water got up through evaporation, evaporation and eclipse of the sun. And Wind. The wind is because the sun heats up the air. It's all from the sun. Of course, every transformation loses a bit. So the closer, the more direct to connection you can make to better, which in my opinion would photo the photovoltaics are all about right. Take the energy, put it right into the device, right into electricity, and do it as close to the need as possible, which is pretty much what their company does. With no further ado, I'm going to turn it over to Tony and Shane. Guys, it's all yours. All right, well, um, I just a little background,

Speaker 2:          02:35          turn this on. So voltaic I started about 10 years ago and really, uh, maybe a caveat for census rooms full of engineers. Uh, I'm not an engineer. I'm a business guy and I'd been doing dotcom startups and so on. I'm just interested in environmental issues and um, started looking at, at solar technology, sort of inspired by the flexible solar panels were coming out and the idea that those new technologies would open up new possibilities, new applications. Uh, I was slacking off in Spain at the time and I had little solar charger with me and I carry it around everywhere inside my bag. And, um, with the intention of charging my cell phone. But what I found was that my bag was in the sun all the time and I'd been, I'd never actually pulled this thing out and set it up and pointed at the sun.

Speaker 2:          03:25          And so after awhile it became obvious, okay, somebody should put a panel on the outside of a bag and then you don't have that hassle and it's going to be generating power all the time. So, you know, that was, that's where we came from. That's a, this is the latest iteration of that original idea, a solar panel on the outside battery inside generating a charge and then a Usb port to plug in whatever you need to charge. Uh, from there we really expanded, you know, it was sort of a design project. I didn't really see myself as all that qualified to be doing it, but we're, nobody did. After a couple of years I thought, what the hell? And, um, we got a tremendous amount of press and a lot of customers and we were there and in business. And so the challenge became the design, a full line of bags and recharge tablets and laptops and all that sort of thing.

Speaker 2:          04:15          Uh, ultimately the way it's gone, consortium, Sia, a product line there. Um, we're doing, uh, most recently a bunch of solar lights, uh, which are specifically for emergency preparedness and developing countries, probably most relevant to the makers, uh, uh, panels like this one. It turned out that we way over engineered the panels and, but when people discovered that they became useful for all sorts of applications, and so now we're selling through eight are fruit and spark fun. And, uh, some of those makers are coming back to us in the end and saying, okay, now I need a custom panel. And so now we're in the custom panel business, Tony, or sit down and design a custom panel to, to whatever specs the engineers are looking for. And uh, so that's, that's kind of Valtech in a nutshell.

Speaker 3:          05:07          So has it been moving more further away or more towards the end consumer, but how much of the DIY maker demand is the business occupied with the, uh,

Speaker 2:          05:21          I dunno, I'd say probably still less than 20%, but certainly growing quite significantly. It's probably the fastest growing segment of our market. Uh, that and the custom panel business custom tweaks that people want. Sure. So, um, the, the two biggest things that they want tweaked would be a power specifically for their project or the size. Maybe they have a box that they've designed for their sensor or their project, whatever happens to be and they want some, uh, panel to beautifully fit the box instead of looking

Speaker 4:          05:58          like an off the shelf panel was slapped on top later. But how it's shape, like if I wanted to do Deca, he'd driven, could they come to, you could, we can, we can do all different types of shapes and forms. So it's certainly possible. Yeah. People have asked about circular solar panels, triangular solar panels, and that's all possible. Usually they come back to rectangles. It's more economical and for the power to square centimeter if you just use a rectangle. But all different types of shapes there's or in the hospital, the flexible panels work defined work. The short answer is yes.

Speaker 1:          06:32          Are they, do they approach like the rigid is any reason that they're not as efficient as the fixed panels?

Speaker 2:          06:39          Actually, I lifted this chart from the web that shows, it's, it's a crazy chart. My, uh, former consulting buddies would frown at me for putting this up, but uh, this basically shows all of the different solar technologies from the, from the mid seventies to now. And um, you know, the flexible ones are pretty much those green lines at the thin film panels. And so they're actually starting to approach the efficiency of the silicon cells, which are the blue lines.

Speaker 1:          07:10          Oh, it's actually a different material in them.

Speaker 2:          07:13          Typically. I mean, uh, amorphous silicon is actually silicon just in a different format, but the, uh, Kevin and Telluride and sig cells are the other sort of leading, um, thin film panels and those, those are just using different chemical structures to, to produce the same result. But the thing that really matters is the cost and silicon has come way down in cost for interim silicon panels. And so dominates the market. It's 90% of the installed base, a traditional monocrystalline of polycrystalline silicon cells.

Speaker 1:          07:49          What kind of efficiency gains do you get? If you can start like, like I have a very simple crude solar tracker and it looks to me like double digit percentages better. Is that like really, is that a big gain or their gains you made? And like maybe changing the shapes that a thesis has more facets. Where do you get the biggest bang for the buck and you know, facing the sun so to speak?

Speaker 2:          08:12          Um, so solar track is definitely making huge difference. Um, and I'll tell you what, if you take a panel and face it directly towards the sun and then even just lay it flat, you know, 30 degrees off that direct angle, you're probably losing 30, 40% of your power. And so you think about the sun moving through the sky, you know, and your panel is facing this way and the sun's over there and over there during the day you might be at 30, you know, early in the day, 30, 40% of the potential power of that panel. If you can track it all day long, then absolutely double digit gains in the output of the panel.

Speaker 1:          08:50          Um, do the, I guess it's probably varies with the, with the different chemistry in the different, in the different types of panels, but do panels like how far in the, in the spectrum to their, does their, let's Say v Vision Extend, does infrared work, does ultraviolet contribute? Is there like a reason to not filter, for example, with the pane of glass for pain of acrylic,

Speaker 4:          09:11          the curve on the graph on the right answers your question. That's the spectral response of how monocrystalline solar panels respond to a UV light. And I each solar cell, it responds to different wavelengths of light better. So, uh, the ones that we use monocrystalline cells are more geared towards a 1000 nanometer, um, the wavelength of light. But there could be other types of cells like these multi junction cells which go on satellites, which respond to all different wavelengths of light and that can absorb a lot more power. And this is one of the reasons that the efficiency of solar panels is, is limited because they can only really turn certain wavelengths of light into electricity, but, but not all of it.

Speaker 1:          09:55          Are there any, I mean this probably, I'm sure that if I thought about this first, I wouldn't ask this question, but are there any like compounds, cells, where would you like just interleave you know, the different types. So here in this large services, we have 40% of each portion of the spectrum represented.

Speaker 4:          10:10          Yeah, that's a great question. Uh, it is, the answer is yes, they're called multi junction cells and that that's what goes for if you're incredibly space constrained and finances are not a question, uh, so it'd be sort of your, the government then, uh, they'll put those on satellites and Mars rovers and stuff like that. And that's where they can get, um, 30 to 40% efficiency on, on the panel, which had, but there'll be paying, you know, a hundred times more than what the consumers are a, but if you're a rover on Mars, so you can afford that. Whereas the efficiency of consumer product, solar panels and rooftop modules would be 18 to 24%.

Speaker 1:          10:49          Okay. Yeah. And that kind of thing, like, yeah. When space is what counts, not money, I'm shipping it tomorrows. Exactly. You know, I've got money. I don't have rocket fuel. Exactly. Exactly. Um, what are, what are the popular consumer product for the, like for the bags and backpacks? What are people buying them?

Speaker 2:          11:09          The bags have certainly been popular, probably the sort of mainstream product. Uh, actually we have one here, this, uh, this, uh, fold up solar panels. So that's kind of the most common thing you would see on Amazon or somewhere that, that is basically just a straight panel, a USB port on it with a regulator, a skipping the battery entirely. And so as a consequence, a lot cheaper, pretty easy to make. Um, and these are, you know, these are really everywhere. Uh, the challenge is that as soon as you're charging a device straight from the solar panel, the regulation of it gets difficult. And particularly with specific brands of phones and so on, they've got all sorts of protections in the, in the circuitry that essentially mean you heard that well. Yes. Uh, and so, you know, you put it out in the sun, but there's a cloud and then all of a sudden the power drops and the phone won't let it recover. And so, you know, real advantages with these that they're lightweight and they're relatively cheap, but, uh, some, some challenges in getting them to charge all devices

Speaker 1:          12:17          thing. To me, he says just one intro battery and plan ahead.

Speaker 2:          12:20          Well, exactly. Yeah. And that's what we do. And you know, all of that bags have a battery in. And you know, really that's the more convenient approach anyway. Because if you're, I mean, if you happen to need a charge when you're in the sun, Great. But if that, those two things don't coincide, then really you need a battery to bridge that gap. And so a better, a better approach is to have a battery in the mix somewhere

Speaker 1:          12:43          to campus typically buy these parts or is it like people who live in the city who just want to have one that I use the cameras need it or want it has a very distinctive line between them?

Speaker 2:          12:56          Yeah, I think so. I'm sure there's a, you know, I mean we see where our products are shipping and, and certainly there are plenty going to New York City and other places. Um, and probably people could get away without it and in many cases, but then some of the applications, there's really no other option. You know, we've got photographers a spending weeks out in jungles or remote places and they need to run the cameras. There's not really another option or you're remote environmental sensors that are going to be sitting there on their own for a year. You know, they, they need these panels and uh, a lot of adventure travelers and pretty cool. It's like, you know, 60 year old lady hiking through the desert with a camel for pretty much the last 20 years. Yeah. I wish I had the picture, actually. She's fantastic. Um, so lots of, lots of diverse applications and certainly those worst solar's the only realistic option. You can't like a battery and with you if it's an extended period of time, wind isn't viable. And, and solar is the only thing that you can trim it down to the size you need and carry with you. So

Speaker 1:          14:01          yeah. So something you talked about earlier with me at lunch, I want to bring up now where, what's happening in like, I think it was Subsaharan Africa, what's, what are you doing? They're not personally, but you know, as a company.

Speaker 2:          14:13          Sure. Um, not, not as much as I would like. Uh, you know, it's really, uh, there's a tremendous opportunity to have a huge impact in those places,

Speaker 1:          14:24          the other places without, with lots of Sun and not a lot of existing infrastructure.

Speaker 2:          14:28          Exactly, exactly. So, you know, 1.2 be and people apparently without electricity in the world and most of those people are in sub Saharan Africa, uh, and then another billion with totally unreliable electricity. And when you think about it, the grid in many cases just hasn't made it to those people and is probably never going to. And what we'll have is something like the same sort leap frog we have with cell phones bypassing the wired telephone network is, is happening now with solar and you can avoid, you know, you can give up on ever getting the grid so long as you can have a viable alternative where solar energy, um, and, and it, it is happening. It's been obvious that that should happen. The problem is much of the market has been poisoned by junk. They're really cheap, shoddy products that poor people are spending a big chunk of their income on only to find out at the end of the day that it's, it's not working as they expected it to.

Speaker 2:          15:25          It doesn't last as well. So I guess what we're doing, um, first of all, we've designed solar lights that are high quality and good work properly and, uh, and we're trying to get those into those markets. The biggest challenge is getting our costs down so that it's viable. And then we work with a lot of aid organizations, uh, that, that are doing a I the survey work or post disaster recovery, that sort of thing in, in those markets. So there, there's some of our bigger customers are at the top of the list there. Uh, so yeah, there they're probably right.

Speaker 1:          15:58          The two main things we're doing that if today I want to say like, what's the, what's the most popular use case in New York City? What are your products? What do you think it is

Speaker 2:          16:13          in New York City? I don't know. Perhaps the bike helmet is going to take off. Not out to them. There's my Kickstarter. Um, you know, honestly the, the challenge in New York City is, is even getting any sunlight. And you know, so we've done, uh, a number of installations where it'll be, for example, an emergency lighting situation. I did a micro apartment where we put a little panels on the ledge and we ran and threw it or battery and a lighting system. So that in the event of a blackout, you've still got a way to charge your phone and light. Um, but it's, it's not, it's sort of mainstream application that was really sort of a, an experiment. There are a bunch of data centers around the place. Um, Tony actually built one, which, uh, top left, there was a air quality monitor. Uh, and there's similarly, you know, water level monitors in the, in the rivers that are going to detect either a, the level of the water or the quality of the water, those sort of things. And I think probably iot applications of that nature, environmental sensors are going to be one of the, the sort of main opportunities you see them on. Not our product, sadly, but, uh, all the city bike stations have a solar panel on them.

Speaker 1:          17:33          I remember seeing light, I think like maybe emergency phones on what are the bridges that writing across a big solar panel on top.

Speaker 2:          17:40          True. Yeah. And parking meters as well for that matter. Uh, certainly anywhere where you don't want to have to uh, run AC power, then solar starts

Speaker 1:          17:50          to make sense. The challenge is as, as you see with this example of the city by panel, it's, it's beautiful looking panel, but it's in a canyon. And so the period of time during which it'll get direct sun, which is a 30 degree. Exactly. It's very limited. And then, um, you know, to make it worse, the panel's not oriented towards the Sun. Uh, and so it will get even less power. Yeah. Yeah. And then, you know, probably for reasons of design, it's actually that poll that it's inside uses a tinted plastic, uh, which really mess this up a little more clearly. It wasn't a solar engineer designing that, but you know, it is beautiful. So actually I'm going to take some of the products brought and passed them around. That's a good one to pass around. That's a, that's our new solar light. That's a mighty break load.

Speaker 1:          18:42          Leds are so efficient nowadays that the opportunity for, so lighting's really opened up. Uh, and so, you know, in the next few years we will see that penetration of, of finally solar lighting into these places that he currently using kerosene. So where do you see where he said the next big, what's it, what's the big opportunity waiting for volt, painful for, you know, portable solar products in general for you specifically? Like what's, what's the next thing to do that has an impact? The next big opportunity for us ties into the next big trend in the tech world of connected devices and smart devices. And there's estimates that say there's going to be billions of connected smart devices in the world within the next few years and less than 10 years. And so much of those need to be powered off the grid, uh, visit a smart microwave. Of course it can be powered, but if it was some other connected device for, for cities are scientists that's out in the wilderness, it's going to need some sort of power in the most reliable sources, typically solar power.

Speaker 1:          19:44          So I think we, we've already got a start with that with some momentum with the custom solar panels that we're doing for, for sensors and, and scientists and other projects. Um, but I'm really excited to see where that goes and see how we can use those sensors on a macro scale. That was such a perfect answer. So I have, so I'll share with my current project is I'm going to buy a bunch of panels for is I'm in charge of my parents former home. I've turned off the electricity there, but I still want a burglar alarm. Sure. That's all particle up there. So I've got a particle electron. I'm looking at you. How well I can tell the parent basically send me an SMS if you see any emotion because she couldn't be an emotion here. Sure. That's exactly what I was thinking. Yeah. I'll help you find the perfect panel for that. Talk to me offline and you know what, I think, um, it's a good time for Q and a. Any questions relative to the Allen? Let me just repeat it. Okay. Repeat. Okay. Why do you think solar has penetrate data?

Speaker 3:          20:48          Even things like example, like park rooftops, uh, like things that, that we use everyday and then suddenly you're like, I need to return something and I don't have anything that I can like take out of it. Like a car has a battery, but you can not take a rechargeable device out of the car that has been recharging justify the solar panel. He's like, it's something that, that piece out their own design when the design.

Speaker 1:          21:12          So the question is why having the solar panels penetrated or made their way into more ubiquitous places? For example, the roof of a car, when a car has a battery to hold the charge, why isn't it this whole panel attached? Why isn't it part of the things that are out there already? Right. Why are they separate?

Speaker 3:          21:28          Is that an effect? It,

Speaker 2:          21:31          I wanted the same thing because it does seem like a logical place to be putting solar panels in, particularly with electric cars coming online. You'd be thinking, okay, well that should be just covered in solar panels. Um, I think the problem, particularly running an electric car is that the power demand versus the amount of power you're going to generate from those panels is, is a long way apart. The, you know, the area of a car is just nowhere near big enough to actually run a car. Um, but you could see that, you know, you might have a soul, a sunroof, and I've, I've seen solar sun rooms and bonnets and that sort of thing, and they'll be used to sort of trickle charge the battery and potentially run, you know, a fan to keep it cool when it's parked, that sort of thing. But it's pretty limited applications.

Speaker 2:          22:18          And when you think about it, the cost of integrating that panel into the roof of the car is relatively high and it's then competing with the alternator in the car as a power source. And it's a lot easier just to use the gasoline in the car to run that and produce energy and recharge the battery that way. And so I suspect that's the calculation that that goes on. And so really it's when the engine's off, you've got a chance to competing and that sort of the smaller scale trickle charger to keep the battery running and maybe a small fan or whatever else you need running when it's turned off

Speaker 3:          22:55          customer and his bag is probably five years old or something. One thing I'm wondering about and you must be getting bored if love advertising because I must've had like over a hundred people over the last five year as I'm wondering how much you got it has helped your business. Because when I look at what you do, maybe this isn't actually, it's already markets, right? This is, this is nice. This is probably not the snare a year ago. So I'm kind of curious how that works.

Speaker 1:          23:24          So the question is with a lot of all word of mouth advertising generated by one of our already in February, um, you must have, you must have consumer demand coming in, but like it seems like maybe that's not your end goal.

Speaker 2:          23:36          No, I think it is our end goal when in fact, I think your, uh, your represented dominant chunk of our marketing strategy. We, you know, we're a small company with limited budget. It's a niche product. And so, you know, it doesn't work out for us to spend a lot of money on advertising and that sort of thing, but you're affectively, you know, walking around with a billboard a that says voltaic and, and I get the same thing. People constantly are asking about it and it's great. You know, it's one of the things we achieve, I think is to initiate a conversation about solar and, you know, does it work and how do you make it work? That sort of thing. And I wouldn't say that it's necessarily irrelevant in a city environment. You can still get periods where you're getting enough sunshine to, uh, to maintain a phone or whatever.

Speaker 2:          24:22          And also there's a battery inside, so even if you're not, it's the middle of winter and you're in New York can still plug it in. It's really a universal charger. But, um, I don't know. You may have noticed we, when we ship the bag out, there's a bunch of little business cards in there with our URL on it and yeah, exactly. They're gone. And, uh, and you know, often people write into us and say, can I have some more cards? Because really sick of writing down the URL, I want to give them out, which is fantastic to hear that.

Speaker 1:          24:50          Yeah. I mean, I know every, every, every traffic stop at least once a ride, someone asks about the helmet. Seriously. And yeah, most people say what's that said like dish, but it's on them to get it right. It's a very distinctive and the AC hum. Let's me in keeping me awake.

Speaker 3:          25:08          What a question. This might be more of a battery of questions, but one of my side projects and all is up off the grid, small server. But the problem that I run into is finding a small battery pack that can be charged on the solutions that I buy online are use [inaudible] acid battery recommendations.

Speaker 2:          25:37          Uh, so, so recommendations

Speaker 1:          25:39          or the, um, the question is, um, he's looking for personal project. I'm basically, he wants to, he wants to charge and draw at the same time for battery.

Speaker 3:          25:48          Perfect.

Speaker 2:          25:49          Right. And, and it's surprising, but that's a common problem. If you look at typical battery packs, uh, they often don't do that or they won't charge from solar because they have a really narrow voltage range on the input, um, and various other issues that come with it. And so that's kind of our job without battery packs is to figure out how to get them charging efficiently from solar and do things like not only charge and discharge at the same time, but allow us to bypass the sleep mode so it can just be on forever. And you can, you know, leave it out in the mountains running whatever sensor you've got. And it'll still be there doing the same thing in a year. And if it runs flat, it'll bounce back when the sun comes back and so on. So, um, it depends on the scale of your project as to what we could recommend. Uh, our batteries are designed to do that, but they're relatively small. So our biggest batteries, a 70 what our battery. Um, after that we are getting into these sort of now lithium ion batteries that might be a couple of hundred watt hours. Uh, we're starting to work on those, but we don't have a solution at the moment. And I'm not sure whether the other products out there have actually solved that problem.

Speaker 3:          27:07          Great. Let's, let's talk afterwards. We'll show you one. Does the, like the harvest inserted, the other one's from at a fruit, but I'm using that. Is that, can that be used to solve this problem with this? I think so. Like it seems like it's almost daily one capacitor away it seems like, but you should look at the fruit on silver harbor, so they have the one that's on that helmet because I feel like it's almost there if he's got a big capacitor where you're drawing, it seems like it could smooth it out for you.

Speaker 4:          27:35          Yeah, it might. That's a good question. I have tested the added free one with compatibility with our panels and batteries and, and it works relatively well. Uh, I, I love all kind of ate fruit stuff, but there's kind of two big problems that he's facing and I don't, I don't know if that solves it. The first is does it constantly discharge small power or turn back on when the device wants power?

Speaker 3:          27:56          Turns it off. That's why. Exactly.

Speaker 4:          27:59          Exactly. Yeah. Most most USB packs on the market we'll, we'll turn off after repeat of time of no load. So it needs to stay on. And then the second part is if it runs flat and then is recharged, does it automatically turn the USB port back on? Um, and uh, that's something that we designed into our batteries in the eight. Everyone might do that as well.

Speaker 3:          28:19          Other questions? No, this one doesn't charge laptops. That one looks bigger. It that actually managed to charge laptops. It's the question is does that, does the larger one charge a laptop?

Speaker 2:          28:36          Yeah. So the one on the top left is designed to charge your laptop and your, this is where the efficiency question really becomes relevant because we've only got so much space on the outside of a bag. And as you can see, we've used everything available in that design. Uh, and even then that a 10 watt panel and really we could quite comfortably use 20 watts and charge at twice the rate for a laptop. But getting a laptop charger on a backpack is, is a relatively difficult thing. And so, um, yeah, that's, that's been a challenge for us. We've also got a like a briefcase thing that's effective and then the foldout panels can be quite good, but you've got to stop and lay them out and so on batteries bigger and you need a higher output. Voltage is obviously for laptops as well as USB. And then all of the same challenges with restarting from flat and always on that sort of thing.

Speaker 3:          29:30          Also, the amount of power you need for a Chromebook for a sense of backfoot pro are very, very different. The find the laptop

Speaker 2:          29:36          very, very different. And so it's, you know, I wouldn't recommend it for, did I do that? I wouldn't recommend it for a 15 inch Mac book. It's just too small to, to produce that amount of power. But, uh, it's, it's nice to say tablets and more efficient laptops out there that, that we can feasibly charge from solar.

Speaker 2:          29:58          I think what, you know, one of the interesting things is when you think about the communities that are off the grid, the, they, they rapidly getting cell phones and cell phones are still the old flip phones and so on. But pretty quickly they're becoming the smart phones and tablets and energy efficient laptops. And you can really see a scenario where the, the off grid house of the future and in developing countries is all DC based. And starting with a solar light, maybe a phone charge, you slowly expand those, those systems so that you can then be running all the stuff that used to run off a whole bank of lead acid batteries and multiple panels on the roof and so on. So, you know, I think it's an exciting time for solar and these devices really fit well

Speaker 3:          30:47          with, uh, with what's happening. What's the primary chemistry and your batteries, are they, are they, um, civil that asset or they lipos

Speaker 2:          30:55          I batteries. Lithium polymer. Yeah. Yeah. And they, you know, so more energy dense then and, and um, much lighter, obviously the lead acid, uh, the future I think is lithium iron phosphate, which doesn't have the same safety concerns that you have with lithium ion lithium polymer. Right, exactly. And you know, that's certainly something that I, I worry about it

Speaker 3:          31:22          really well. Yes. You want to pack more and more energy into a smaller employer that's called innocent.

Speaker 2:          31:27          Close that at some point. Yeah. Yeah. And especially with the mine, it's in a little tube that's a pipe bomb. Um, but you know, fortunately the, the incidents is a relatively few, uh, I would feel much more comfortable if ultimately we can get to lithium iron phosphate that doesn't explode. Apparently we haven't got there yet, but we're working on it. Yes. No, no, not about batteries have responded, caught fire or anything else. Thank you. Tony.

Speaker 3:          31:58          Ellen, how much is in your, or wearables? So the question is how much is way to factor in your consumer wearables? As far as, I guess like what makes it practical? Like how, what's the maximum weight we can pack in more a bigger battery where it, right. At what point does it come in? Practicum?

Speaker 2:          32:16          Yeah, that's, that's definitely the trade off. Um, we try and strike a balance with each of the different products so that, you know, we've got a relatively small battery and a small panel design as a cell phone set up next level's tablets and laptops. And we also try and can set it up so that the customers can configure it as they need to. If they want to upgrade to a bigger battery that in mind could way Dan, then we can do that. And then of course, you know, products like this one a much, much lighter. And so we're really, wait is the primary concern, uh, people might compromise a little on, on functionality and go for something like this that it's much easier to hike with and so on. So it's really up to the customer.

Speaker 1:          32:59          As a former laptop guy in the park and cafe that I was, um, one of the things I always found actually was what the, considering the weight of the laptop I used to put up against the weight of the charger, you know, the world war and the battery life. Like if I could get a laptop the last than seven hours, I, she just lost a pound because then have to turn bad luck and likewise and getting a bag if the bag, wait another pound, but I didn't need my wallboard anymore. You know, that's, that has to be considered as well.

Speaker 2:          33:25          Yeah, absolutely. And one of the things we tried to do is, because we also have ac charges for the batteries as you know, if, if you're not going to be getting access to the grid, we set up a bunch of little adapters so you can just take one ac charger with you and charge both our battery and the laptop from the, from the same thing. It's definitely an issue. The amount of Chunky one I'm carrying around.

Speaker 5:          33:50          Yup.

Speaker 1:          33:53          What's new in the pipeline you share?

Speaker 2:          33:59          Well, the future, the future full of Voltaic uh, yeah, certainly this, this actually, um, is, is the new product and a, and we've got similar ones on the way. Uh, they're not in the market and we haven't shown anyone else yet, but this is a laptop. This is actually more like seven each tablet, cell phone, et Cetera, double that. And you're getting to 10 watts and charging a laptop. Uh, so there's that. But you know, the, the stuff that really excites me is both the iot applications. And so that's us doing, you know, multiple small scale panels that are sort of ready to go off the shelf and the custom panels. And you know, it's really interesting for us when people were coming to us with amazing projects and asking us to provide the power solution and a, and we get to participate in that.

Speaker 2:          34:47          Uh, and then for me personally in particular, but for all of us, the idea of having an impact in developing countries and, and providing electricity where there's none is really, you know, it's, it makes it all worthwhile. And, uh, you know, we'd been doing some truth. We just, when we launched the solar light, we did a buy one give one program and our Kickstarter backers, uh, enabled us to go down to Nicaragua and visit a whole bunch of villages that had no electricity and get up on the roof and install lights and that sort of thing. And so for, for us, that's definitely a big part of the future.

Speaker 2:          35:28          That particular panel is the same as are others. And, and so what we're using at the moment is, uh, most recently world monocrystalline cells. And you see, I can probably show you the, the production process. You know, we slice up the cells and the reason you do it is to try and, because the single saddle is half a volt, so you slice it up into multiple pieces like this. You run them all in series and a and solder them together. And so you see here, this is sort of our production process in summary, um, what's happened and on the right weight coding the panels in poly urethane and it has a great life in the sunlight, 10 years plus. And so that's why our panels, uh, sort of that shiny, uh, look, if you, if you look at some of the newer cells coming out, there's the sunpower cell and these guys are getting up to about 24% efficiency.

Speaker 2:          36:27          Uh, and so we're starting increasingly to use these cells. They're a little more complicated to work with. Uh, and we need to laminate them. We can't go into menopause early. So, um, next steps for us in paddle development will be at least to add these, uh, to the mix and they'll look much more like this folder where it sort of disappears. You know, the sale is almost invisible. Uh, and this is a different manufacturing process, laminated, but much more power per square inch. And, um, I, you know, importantly for us, better looking. So that's, that's one element of our future

Speaker 3:          37:08          where, where is the demand right now? Where are you, where are you shipping your stuff too? And what in what form? Like what does your popular product and target,

Speaker 2:          37:16          it's, it's sort of all over the place. Um, and, uh, we keep getting a little bit blindsided by it because we've got sort of a steady consumer products business and we're selling online on our website and elsewhere and, and that sort of hums along. Uh, but then particularly the aid organizations will come to us with virtually no notice and say, hey, we want your entire stock of this product that we've never ordered before and all of a sudden were wiped out. So, um, I'll put in a good way, a good way. Yeah. So the aid organizations in particular buying backpacks or similar products that sort of strap onto a backpack, um, and then the, the maker community or the, the sort of industrial iot applications at the same sort of thing, they'll come to us and want large quantities of a particular panel or the Alaskas with, you know, I'll go through the whole process to try and do it themselves. And then at the very last minute come back to us and say, Hey, we need, you know, 5,000 of these in three weeks, can you do it? And, um, we started scrambling to try and try and deliver

Speaker 3:          38:27          what like was that a good problem?

Speaker 2:          38:29          Good problem to have? Yeah. Yeah. Keeps it keeps tiny working hard. Work hard. Next questions.

Speaker 1:          38:42          No, all these ones. Okay. The question is all these manufactured by him?

Speaker 2:          38:47          It's, it's a good question. And uh, and that's actually changing too. So you see in the, in the middle photo up there, that's how you know the, the laser cutting on the left is automated, the soldering of the cells is by hand. And so it's this crazy labor intensive process, ah, and prone to all sorts of problems. And then the coding of the panel with polyurethane can be automated. So there are robots that will sort of dispense the right amount, but uh, it, it forces this sort of industry to be done in, in places with lower labor costs. And so you don't actually see any manufacturer on a small scale solar panels in the U S and we've looked at doing it ourselves. And really it just, it just does not off at the moment. But with these some power cells, it's going to open up a really interesting opportunity because instead of having a positive and negative contact on the back and the front, as with the traditional sell, all the contacts are on the back.

Speaker 2:          39:52          And what that means is you can slice the cell up, mounted on it and use an SMT process to mount it on a PCB. And Ron it through the oven, all the electrical connections are made. And so basically the whole thing can be automated and you can get to a point where the production costs for a small scale panel at much, much lower. And so we're working with different factories that have that capability. Um, ultimately I could see that being done in the u s because it eliminates so much of the labor cost. Um, but you know, interestingly, it's, uh, I, I guess the big challenge at the moment is these plastic laminates don't have the same life and the sun, they're probably around three to five years at best. And so what we're doing is looking for higher quality laminates that allow us to produce that sort of a panel. But with a 10 year life and a, and we're very close to being able to do that.

Speaker 1:          40:49          That's interesting. Before I heard you mentioned 10 year and that stuck in my head and I wanted to bring this up so I bought some, a lot of people have them. Sure. Some really cheapo, you know, sharper image level solar lights and a year later they were yellow. Yeah. And I felt like, oh my God, like the cell is still in there. It's just blinded. Right. Glad to hear you say that you're allowing me to count because that's what a thing to put it to fail on.

Speaker 2:          41:09          Well, it's crazy, right? I, you know, when I first started looking at this, I looked at every supplier I could find and basically they are making chunk and, and it's not that all solar is junk. If you look at a rooftop module, you can get a 25 year warranty on that good quality in the same cells, but somehow in the small scale panel market, it's junk. And I think what's happened is that there you can go to home depot and buy six to $36 and I think ours is, consumers have in part just driven down the price that we're prepared to pay. And in parallel or maybe first the manufacturer's drove down the quality of what they were making, if you think right. And so if you think about who, what do you use a small scale panel for? It's 95% garden lights. And so that's the quality of what people were making. And what you're talking about is an epoxy laminated panel. The crazy, you know, it's very similar to the urethane applied in a similar way. All the rest of it, the crazy thing is not UV resistant and so that they're specifically using a material that doesn't hold up in the sun to make small scale paddles. Exactly, exactly. And no one seems to care of it. Brilliant. Yeah. So we've, you know, we pay five times as much to use urethane and you know, we're over engineering because it's going to last longer than a backpack possibly could.

Speaker 5:          42:32          Great. Other questions?

Speaker 2:          42:37          Oh are they recyclable? The, the components that are not junk to, uh, to some extent the bags themselves, the fabric is actually recycled pet. So soda bottles. And so, you know, we're definitely conscious of that. We've used that or where we can, but there's not a process whereby a PT fabric can go back into recycling and uh, and get reused. It may be that it can get sort of down cycle depending on where you live and what their systems are. And so on lithium polymer batteries, we send our batteries off to recycling centers. Uh, I don't, I don't think it's a particularly efficient process for those. The silicon cells, unfortunately we've, you know, you're mixing together multiple different types of material. The substrate, the coating, the cell itself. And actually it's such a thin wafer silicon that it's not a huge amount of material there. So, um, I'm not aware of any sort of great recycling process for particularly ourselves. If you look at a rooftop module, then you've got glass, a glass panel and aluminum frame. Both of those are sort of well suited to recycling.

Speaker 5:          43:51          Thanks.

Speaker 3:          43:55          Definitely more for style projects. That's the solar panel. I wanted a small weather as I can find plenty of like, but it seemed like all the small ones I have to basically build some sort of like are there now like small enclosed panels that I can just leave outside

Speaker 2:          44:26          for small, you know, whether is' panels. Yeah. Surprisingly difficult to find. Right. Sorry, I was just, uh, but because this is fully encapsulated with urethane, um, this is an example of that. Yes. Here it is. Yeah. Okay. And then I'd live in Matt. Most of them seem to be the small glass panels with a big clunky aluminum frame and you know, they, they made it the same way or rooftop module is scaled down and so they work and last as long, uh, but often just too heavy, fragile, whatever it might be. So that could be left to the right. Yeah,

Speaker 4:          45:06          it can, while you're facing is a very common problem for outdoor sensors and outdoor projects. I talked to an engineer, like an agricultural sensor company and he's like, yeah, we found some great small solar panels and then they do laminated in the rain after six months. Uh, so, um, yeah, it is very difficult to, to waterproof it, but since it's fully encapsulated, it's not only good in the rain. We've had these bobbing on the Indian Ocean for months and the full water salt water, yeah. They, they are saline resistant. Um, and there was no de lamination. Um, so if yeah, they're definitely capable and that's why we say they're kind of over engineered for the backpacks. Um, but yeah, rain, snow, water submersion there. They're fully tight.

Speaker 1:          45:49          Cool. How can we take one more question or no more questions? Okay. Going once, going twice.

Speaker 5:          46:01          Okay. Would that,

Speaker 1:          46:02          thank you very much guys. It's good to see this kind of stuff, the good seed quality that there actually is advances in this cause this is what's going to save the planet. Right?

Speaker 2:          46:12          Yeah. And I think the other thing to say is that I'm sure you're working on some really interesting projects and that's the sort of stuff that gets us excited. Anytime you want to talk to us, you know, engineering at Valtech systems, uh, or come out and visit us. We're at the navy yard and the new lab building up in Brooklyn. I ride by every morning. Right, right. And you know, really, uh, it's this sort of stuff that's really exciting for us to participate in the Iot and the maker type application. So let us know. We'd be happy to help get involved, do whatever we can.

Speaker 1:          46:46          Great. Actually 20, I'll talk to you about my iot up solar powered burglar alarm. Oh yeah, sorry. That's the project that we're a building, just moved up to electronic. Okay, great. Thanks very much guys. And Michelle, thank you.
