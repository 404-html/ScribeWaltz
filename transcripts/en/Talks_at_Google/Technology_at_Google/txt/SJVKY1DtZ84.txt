Speaker 1:          00:09          So, um, I just finished the book over the weekend. Um, and I really appreciated all the stories, right? Like you, you have been, you know, a firsthand participant and talk to, uh, lots of other people who were about like the evolution of this from, you know, kind of a crazy idea that, you know, a handful of small teams worked on and, and, uh, it's, I really loved all the stories and just getting to know the peoples, you know, someone you might hear about in the news and I just love the way he's told the story. So I thought, um, since you know, this is where at Google, this is a book about the driverless car. Maybe a fun story to jump into would be to tell everybody a little about your first ride in the chauffeur car.

Speaker 2:          00:57          Happy to do that. And thanks everybody for coming today. It's a real pleasure. It's a pleasure to be part of your team. Actually. Um, I was, um, uh, General Motors until 2009, um, we had competed in the Darpa urban challenge in 2007. You know, that was a race of robotic cars and the first prize was $2 million and Jim was starting to hit the wall at that time. So I figured we needed the money, we better go out and win this race. But we sponsored a Carnegie Mellon's team and Chris Urmson who subsequently led this program for Google self driving cars, um, reached out to me after I left Gm. They were looking for a gray beard auto executive that could, could help them out. So I came out in 2010. Uh, the deal was I'd come out and talk to them if I could ride in the car and they had 13 Prius's.

Speaker 2:          01:48          Um, and it was remarkable progress because at the urban challenge, we had a Chevy Tahoe sport utility vehicle that was just loaded with hardware. I mean, you could, you could barely squeeze one person into the vehicle and by the time they were doing the testing in 2009 and 10, they had it in a press. Most of all the hardware was in the trunk of the Prius, plus the sensors on the outside. So at that time you could write on one on one in the vehicle. Um, and it's a basically an expressway. So I drove the car out. I had a technician next to me in the passenger seat and I had an engineer in the back seat and I had a big red panic button on the council. So this is, you know, too late 2010 early 2011 and they said okay, just to engage it like you would cruise control.

Speaker 2:          02:34          I was in the Middle Lane of the freeway and my hands are shaking over the steering wheel. My feet are shaking, I think, and this is crazy, but you know, once I engaged it, within about a couple minutes, Jeremy has started feeling natural. The car was intuitive. Even at that point in time a Volkswagen beetle came up on my left and cut in front of me and I realized the car I was in, it already backed off and started to create a gap for that vehicle to get into. And you would never be able to do that as a driver. This technology has like eagle eye vision with eyes in the back of your head. Later on, a big semi truck came up on my right and sure enough my car was nudging over a bit. But when I found so fascinating was after the first 10 minutes it was so relaxed. I wasn't even worried about weather traffic backed up in front of man. I never thought about jumping to the right lane or left lane to get in front of someone. It just took all the road rage and stress out of driving. So I was sold and that that was a remarkable accomplishment and just a real testament to how good this team was that you had a Google self driving cars.

Speaker 1:          03:33          Yeah, it was, it was really striking to hear the, the I, there's a story you tell about I think riding in one of the early Carnegie Mellon cars. Yeah.

Speaker 2:          03:41          Yeah. Well, I, um, because general motors was the sponsor of the Carnegie Mellon boss, we call the boss of the Chevy Tahoe. And I thought it was important that I, being head of R and d go out and put in an appearance and get to know the team. We had some of our engineers embedded with the team. And so I went out and they had it out on a test track, which was, um, a real old like steel plant that it, then they sort of just sort of grabbed it and started using, I don't even know if they had permission to do it, but it was rutted roads and everything. And they were showing me how the vehicle would operate autonomously. And I said, well, I'd like a ride in it. And he kind of looked at me and it's found, they didn't say no, but I said, yeah, I really would like to write on it.

Speaker 2:          04:23          So they squeezed me in that one other area that you could fit into. Well, this vehicle wasn't designed for a human, this vehicle was designed to win a self driving car race. So it accelerated very aggressively. Stopped very aggressively cornered very aggressively and within about 30 seconds I'm getting so carsick and they're all laughing about this because they really put one over on me. But that was an important point. Um, the Carnegie Mellon team felt that by being an aggressive driver, we were more like an x games athlete in this competition. We knew Stanford was going to be more like I'm a figure skater and they were going to have a really smooth, nice, precise vehicle. But we knew enough about the race that we thought we could pick up six minutes but accelerating hardened braking hard and we won the race by 20 minutes. So that was an important part of our,

Speaker 1:          05:15          yeah. You mentioned a writing in the chauffeur car the first time you, you pretty quickly, we're relaxed and not worried about things and you sorta comment that they're actually, you know, there, there are different strategies being pursued in the marketplace today about, you know, like how do, how do we deploy this technology, how do we bring it to a mass audience? And one is kind of this driver assist version that um, and, and the other is more of a service and he kind of observed that. Um, what'd you say? I think that uh, the driver assist version says you don't need to pay attention to the road except that because it's an assistant, it also says you need to be paid paying attention at all times in order to take over. And I want, if you want to comment a little, yeah,

Speaker 2:          06:00          no, the Google self driving car team I think may two really big decisions. They've made a lot of great decisions, but early on they made the decision that they wanted to create a car that didn't rely on what's called vehicle to vehicle or vehicle to infrastructure communication. So a lot of people on this field thought that if you get cars talking to each other, they could avoid each other. But I think the Google self driving car came realize that you'd have to have all cars capable and would take forever to get to that point. They also believe because of your background mapping and because of their knowledge of the sensors that they could actually do a standalone self driving car. And, and, and that was critically important. They began to develop this technology that I experienced on the freeway and they thought maybe they could do an initial product called the highway assist.

Speaker 2:          06:48          And they did a dog fooding a exercise with the local mountain view. Google employees ask them to use the vehicle on weekends. They had a promise to pay attention to their driving, but they could take you to lake Tahoe and stuff alone. And behold, within the first few weeks we realized that that these people were totally distracted. One individually even fell asleep and you would never been able to reengage them if something came up. Uh, and uh, the Daniel Fairfield on the team, he reached an important conclusion, I think shared with all of us. He said, you know, if we always keep the driver in the loop, we're never going to be safer than the driver. 90% of the crashes are due to human error. So they concluded these driver assist. Jeremy was not consistent with their goal, which was to eliminate car crashes all together and made the second really important decision that their commitment was to totally autonomous where a person would never be asked to take over. Now you can imagine what a challenge that is because you have to discover all those really unusual things that happen in everyday driving or every year driving that long tail. And that's part of what's going on right now is this continued learning. But it's also part of the reason why Waymo has such a head start on everyone because they, they've been doing this a long time and they've accumulated a lot of experience.

Speaker 1:          08:10          I was curious, you know, as far as reducing the fatality rate, I checked, it sounds like, um, there's little over one fatality per hundred million miles driven or something. So to get a sense on whether really safer, does that mean we need to get a few hundred million miles?

Speaker 2:          08:28          These cars you have have two or, and I would say an supplement that with AI and machine learning and great simulation models. So you know, this isn't about any one sensor. It's not about anyone enabling technology. It's this combination of maps, sensors, onboard processor of software, and then in the development process to be able to go out there and capture a lot of, when you encounter something unusual on the road, bring that back to the lab and simulate it virtually simulate it in reality and learn about the edge cases and get confident that you've dealt, not just with the unusual thing that you observed. So take traffic circles, for example. We've all, you've all probably been in a traffic circle. Have you been in two lane traffic circles or three lane traffic circles and do you have to capture everything about all of those in the real world or can you model that and get to the edge cases and move yourself forward?

Speaker 1:          09:27          Yeah, I hadn't thought about that. So it's a part of it is real world driving. Part of it is taking the data you've collected from strives and simulating and that gets us closer to those hundred millions.

Speaker 2:          09:38          So, so you say, why am I my, my Google get into this? Um, I think because we're not a car company, but extraordinary deep knowledge of computer science, uh, and um, and robotics, you know, the best surfers in the world, the best mapping system in the world, great AI teams, and it's really a shift, fundamental shift. And what are the core competencies required to be a leader and transportation in the future versus the historic once in the historic ones, which recover quite a bit on the book. Really like 130 years of history of combustion based vehicles that are energized by oil that are human controlled with the controls being hydraulic and electronic primarily. And those competencies were about combustion and the driver interface to get the ultimate driving machine. And we're going to have in the future of the ultimate writing machines, not the ultimate driving machine. So this is a profound shift and the fundamental competencies to be a leader in transportation.

Speaker 1:          10:41          Yeah, yeah. I think you, you know, you sort of explained that there are three trends that are coming together, right? There's the, the software and the driverless technology, um, and there's electric vehicles which have some advantages. They're much easier for software to control then all mechanical one. And then there's this idea of transportation as a service rather than, you know, personal ownership. And those are like the three factors that are all coming together.

Speaker 2:          11:09          Yeah. Yeah. They bought come together. Two of them are really technology enabled on the other one has a business model innovation. So again, it's not about one thing, it's about several things combining at the same time. I'd like to call that the power of an that's the connecting of the dots. And here's Kinda how this, this logic goes. When you have an autonomous vehicle, suddenly you don't need to pay a person to drive the vehicle and reposition it. And um, that makes selling transportation as a service, a pretty compelling opportunity because you've lowered the cost then of getting high utilization out of the vehicle. So it can pick me up, take me to my destination, dropped me off, and then without any labor costs, go a couple blocks and pick up and take you to your destination or drop you off and keep doing that throughout the day.

Speaker 2:          11:56          And you get very high utilization of that fleet. Uh, today, most cars are used about 12,000 miles a year, or these transportation service business model suggested would be 75,000 miles a year. The cars are parked 90 to 95% of the time. What I just described means the vehicle is in route to pick you up rather than being parked, but what you, what you do then is because it's autonomous and it's a service you want to optimize the cost per mile. The car industry has been focused on optimizing the price of a new car at a dealership when you go there and fall in love with it to buy it. When you optimize the cost per mile, it turns out electric drive is a really good deal because of fleet optimized costs per mile. You want the vehicle last about 300,000 miles and electric drive can save you five to 10 cents a mile.

Speaker 2:          12:44          That's 15,000 to $30,000 over the lifetime, which is more than enough to pay for the electric drive still. The funny thing about this is it's autonomous vehicles. I think that's going to get us past the tipping point for electric vehicles, not to make this story even better. 80% of the trips we make as Americans are one and two person trips, but our cars aren't. Trucks are designed way over designed for the occasional trip. When you tailor designed this autonomous electric vehicle for this transportation service and the most typical trips, it probably wants to be a two person vehicle is probably going to have about one 10th as many parts in it as a conventional car. And that is really important to understand if you're in the car industry. So it's, it's, it's the simplicity of electric drive. You don't have transmissions, you don't have exhaust systems, you have gasoline tanks, you don't have all those mechanical parts in the engine moving and you get rid of all the parts with a driver interface. So boom, it's really transformational.

Speaker 1:          13:44          One of the stories that actually it was one of my favorite in the book, I think it was when, uh, Byron Mccormick brought you out to the vehicle assessment center and he, you know, he sort of showed you that maybe you want to describe what that was like. Yeah,

Speaker 2:          13:57          yeah. Um, and in 1988, I was asked to lead an initiative at GM called design for manufacturing and, um, you know, we had a lot of different products and our cars just seem like they were harder to put together than our competitors. And so we decided to tear apart or competitors, cars, lay out all the parts and then conceive of how they're building their cars. And Lo and behold, we were way a uncompetitive. So this tear down sooner became an important place for a lot of the leaders at GMB begin to visualize what was going on by Ren Maccormack who reported to me was one of the best technologists I've ever worked with. He had, uh, uh, ran the battery plant for GMC [inaudible]. He was one of the pioneers of what's now called stability control. Um, but very importantly he led our fuel cell program as well.

Speaker 2:          14:47          And Byron and his team conceived of what we call a vehicle called [inaudible] flux, which was based on these principles of electric motors in the wheels, energy storage and the platform, almost like a skateboard. And then by wire steering, by wire breaking and really optimized around software. And you went ahead and prototyped that and laid out all the parts in a torn down way, in the same place where he took apart a Chevy Malibu and they took about a Prius and lay those parts out with a Prius, had more parts than a Malibu cause it was a hybrid. But the flex have radically fewer, I mean you could really see where the industry was going to had when it was going to be an electrical and electronically controlled. So we brought my boss Rick Wagner and who is the chairman and CEO of GM. He had to see this and he, he got it. He understood it wasn't just all the fewer parts because the parts that you have to design, engineer released manufacturer tool, they drive the cost structure of a car company, but it was also was the software and that was just so important. And it's I think a lesson out of that as when you have an idea and you're trying to communicate it, getting to rapid prototyping and making it visible for a lot of people I think really helps get your idea communicated.

Speaker 1:          16:00          Yeah. Yeah. I love, I love the visual of seeing, you know, the, the car exploded and all the parts of the Malibu and then, uh, the electric vehicle with radically fewer parts. That's just a great way to get your point across. Um, that, uh, one of the other things I found fascinating and I said, you know, it sounds like maybe 2010, 2011, I think you were at Columbia and you were kind of modeling how this would work and I think you picked Ann Arbor and a few other cities and found that, you know, like you can offer this service with actually not that many cars relative to the number of cars that people actually, you know, park in their driveways in Ann Arbor.

Speaker 2:          16:40          Yeah. There was a famous economics professor at Columbia named Jeff Sachs and he had written the book end of poverty and he was running an institute called the Earth Institute. And when GM was going bankrupt, he came and visited us. And um, I gave him an overview of some of the thinking we have longer term and Jeff and I hit it off and when I left GM he asked me if I would leave Columbia's program for a sustainable mobility, which, which I decided to do. And what we were really interested in is, no kidding. What would city looked like if you combined tailor designed vehicles for the two person, one person trip with electric drive that are autonomous and importantly shared, how many would you need to meet all the transportation requirements of a city and how much would it cost? And so we decided to model this and at that time there was a really neat database.

Speaker 2:          17:33          It was a 2009 a household travel surveys from the federal government. And it gave us a good idea of how many cars were in cities like Anarbor Austin or Columbus, Ohio, Rochester, New York, Manhattan, uh, Palm Beach County, Florida. So we sat down and started to model this. And um, there were 200,000 cars in Anarbor, about 120,000 of them stayed within the metropolitan area. And our modeling came back and said we could get all of the trips that those cars are making done with 15, 18,000 shared vehicles, just 15% of the cars that were there. We thought we had to be wrong because at the same time we concluded we could get to the customers quickly within minutes. And that the fleet would be highly utilized. And we kept studying this, convinced we didn't have it right, but finally we understood the population density of places like Ann Arbor was high enough such that the trip frequency throughout the 14 busy hours of the day was high enough such that just after they'd drop me off somewhere in Anarbor.

Speaker 2:          18:37          Sure enough there was a high probability someone a couple blocks away was requesting a ride. And that's how the math worked out and that, that was the moment. And then when we said what would this cost, you know, the electricity costs, the insurance, the cost of the vehicle, d being depreciated finance costs, both your time cost and out of pocket costs. We thought we could get to something on the order of 20 cents a mile. And that's compared to owning and operating a card about a dollar 50 including your time cost. So you, but you bounced that against the 3 trillion miles a year that Americans drive. And that's a $4 trillion disruption. And that, that was a pretty big Aha. And we went about getting that story told and it was a lot of fun.

Speaker 1:          19:20          Yeah. Yeah. And so how much did that for four and a half trillion dollars is spent on fossil fuels?

Speaker 2:          19:29          Well, um, uh, it's, we use about 180 billion gallons of gasoline a year. So, you know, three bucks, I'd say about a 500, 500 billion.

Speaker 1:          19:40          Yeah. Yeah. So, you know, if this works out, it's going to really significantly.

Speaker 2:          19:46          Very significantly. Yeah. And an interesting irony is sad irony about that. As the year General Motors went bankrupt, um, embarrassingly we lost $32 billion. Exxon Mobil may $45 billion that year. Oil prices has gone to a dollar 60 a barrel. I'm sorry, I'm sorry, $160 a barrel and come to 160 and they made $45 billion. That was the highest profit ever made by a company at that point in time. And the sad thing about that oil consumption is when you refine it to make gasoline and you burn it in a combustion engine, about 75% of that energy is 70. Let's say 75 to 80%, it gets lost as heat and friction and sound, that kind of a thing. So about 20 to 30% crates torque that turns the wheels of the car, the car's way, three to 4,000 pounds and people were, you know, 120 to 200 pounds, Jeremy. The bottom line is just one to 2% of the energy and that gallon of gasoline moves you the driver. And here's this company that makes $45 billion. Uh, and the only way Exxon Exxonmobil could have done that. That's because GM was in the business of building and selling cars that relied on oil.

Speaker 1:          21:01          Yeah, yeah. That's a, it's a disruption in a lot of ways.

Speaker 2:          21:06          Well, it's a huge, it's a huge disruption. It's a disruption to the people who drive for a living and, and uh, I understand that and I respect that. If my professional was being disrupted by this, I don't think I would feel comfortable about that. But, and also it's a disruption to the auto industry because far fewer parts mean far fewer employees, um, in the supply base. And at the original equipment manufacturer and base, but also far fewer engineers cause you have to design fewer parts. It's a disruption to the corner gas station operator because these vehicles will be supplied probably through fleets. By the way, you could have one for your dedicated use. Please don't think the only solution here is a shared vehicle like an Uber without our driver. You certainly can subscribe to one and have it for your own personal dispatch desires. But at the end of the day, you're not going to want to stop to refuel it, a recharge it. So this recharging is going to be done at a depot and out of the corner gas station. And the beauty of that is that lets us introduce alternatives to oil without having to have 170,000 gas stations. So you pull that string parking gets impacted, dealers get impacted, land, juice and real estate gets impacted. The entire economy gets impacted quite frankly.

Speaker 1:          22:21          Yeah, it's uh, it's, it's fascinating to sort of enter into that analysis in the book. I was also thinking we're here in New York City. Uh, so I think the recent news is that the city is considering putting a limit on the number of Uber and Lyft drivers. Uh, and, and sort of, I'm like, I wonder what your take on that sort of policy issue in the short term is, you know what?

Speaker 2:          22:47          Well, I, you know, I, I believe, um, it's an important issue because you have an awful lot of people out there trying to make money as a, as an Uber driver and there needs to be this balance between supply and demand. And if you have too many people out there and not enough customers are going to have more cars on the road, not really creating value. So that's problematic. I do worry about governments thinking they can regulate that rather than the market finding that right balance. So I am concerned about that. When you do get to driverless cars, um, your whole goal will be to have high fleet utilization because that's key to making money. You're going to optimize the size of your fleet so that you have high utilization, low empty miles and fast response times. And, um, so I don't think that carries over to the driverless discussion.

Speaker 2:          23:37          Fortunately, the regulators at the local state and federal level for driverless cars have that. The only way we're going to get to this goal of fully driverless is to learn on public roads. So they haven't stepped up and said, you can't do this. And that's by the way, that's a big difference between general motors and Google. Um, uh, Sebastian Thrun and Chris Urmson in their team, when they started their project, they wanted to learn on public roads. And so they wondered if they could do it in the law in California said you needed to have a driver in the driver's seat. It didn't say you needed to touch the steering wheel, the brake feller or the accelerator. So they just went off and did it. My General Council term owners would say, no way, you can only test in a, in a proving ground. So they had to get on public roads and this, this is a technology, you think about that you eliminate 90% of the crashes in the world.

Speaker 2:          24:31          There's 1.3 million people a year dying on the world's roadways that is epidemic and scale. Get rid of 90% of that. That's a million lives a year. Divide that by 365. That's 3000 lives a day. If we get to this end goal one day sooner, we're going to save 3000 lives. So I think the biggest risk is not moving fast enough and the regulators fortunately haven't said stop, haven't said you can't learn on public roads and, and we're making good progress. We need to be open, share the data and uh, learn together. But I think we'll take the journey and we'll get there, Jeremy. I really do.

Speaker 1:          25:10          Yeah. It reminds me of a, of another funny story in the book. Um, I think from early on with the Carnegie Mellon team that they were posting videos, uh, on their blog of testing the vehicle stopping and someone somewhere on your team, a middle manager saw it and thought, oh my God, I can't believe GM is funding this. We got to put an end to it.

Speaker 2:          25:31          Yeah. Very, very different cultures. We, we had a sad stretch in the late eighties and early nineties of too many fatalities in our plants. These were our employees. Maybe they had to do maintenance on a robot and they didn't lock, lock, lock out the robot and they got in there and gotten electrocuted or something. So we said, enough is enough. So we went and benchmark the best in the world, I'll call dupont. And we wanted to be the benchmark, safest company to work for. So safety was really ingrained into everybody at GM. So in this individual who, who reported to me, so how our Carnegie Mellon's team was just in the vehicles. He felt it was way outside the envelope on our safety culture and um, felt we needed to shut down the program. We worked through that. Chris Urmson did a good job with some diplomacy and a, but really I can't overemphasize that safety has to be the overriding priority for, for any organization.

Speaker 2:          26:25          And, and I so admire what the Google self driving car team has accomplished and they've done it with a tremendous safety culture. They've got this group, we call it the ops group. And the every morning they shake down all of the cars, make sure the curves physically ready to go out on the road, put their cell phones in their locker, they go out and they're highly trained people, um, following standardized processes and they really, really take their job seriously. Whenever, if I ever have a chance to be in the area where they work, you, you almost feel like it's the same discipline you would see and the military operations, it's that serious and it's paid off for us. Waymo has had one APP for fault. Crash was a two mile per hour fender bender. We've had some others and, and all those other cases, it was the other driver with the human driver that caused it.

Speaker 1:          27:18          Yeah. I'm curious about it. Like, yeah. What, what the limits of, um, unexpected things you can plan for our, um, uh, um, thinking to a story from the urban mobility challenge. You know, what happens if you're a autonomous vehicle pulls up next to the jumbo tron in that,

Speaker 2:          27:41          yeah. Staples, the GPS. This was one of these, these moments, the Carnegie Mellon and team, um, had some challenges along the way. The first race was in the desert and part of their development work, they rolled their homer, which was her development vehicle over and that caused some problem with sensors. And we think that's why it only went seven miles. And the second race, Lo and behold, they have the same thing happened. They had two vehicles in that race, the one that really was probably the best vehicle and had a, a fuel, um, or actually an electromagnetic interference since we found out later on damaged and it was causing strange things with the fuel. And um, so the uh, lost my train of thought. I can term it was okay.

Speaker 1:          28:26          I was thinking about the and then in the urban mobility.

Speaker 2:          28:29          Oh yeah, yeah. And then in the actual Darpa urban challenge, um, we were the favorite. We thought we were going to win this race. We felt real good about all of our tests and through the preliminary hates, they sorted down to 14 finalists and we were in the pole position. And that meant we got to go out on the track first and we couldn't get the gps to calibrate something just wouldn't lock in. And um, everyone's panicking and they go to get another GPS unit and it turns out ESPN was covering the event and they had a huge jumbo tron located right next to our vehicle. And the person from the defense, advanced research projects agency, Darpa, who sponsored at Tony Tether said, turn off the jumbo tron in Cerner as they turned it off, gps calibrated and we were back in the race. So yes, there are, those are learning things.

Speaker 2:          29:26          Yeah. You know, I dedicate this book to engineers who make what's possible real. How many of you here today or are engineers or computer science or technical backgrounds? I mean, that's really what we do. And, and I'm an engineer from the top of my, to the tips of my toes. And as long as the principles of science are followed, I think an engineer can accomplish almost anything if you give them the right learning cycles. But who would have thought we would've had this interference? But now we know. And, and that's what this is all about. Learning way out on the tail of the distribution on, on learning cycles. And that was one of those great examples of learning.

Speaker 1:          30:09          Great example of what's going to go wrong in the real world when we

Speaker 2:          30:13          yes, yes, things will go wrong in the world, real world. Sadly they go wrong and kill 40,000 Americans a year right now. And um, I, I, I have to be really candid with you. Every time I read about someone going in the wrong way on the interstate and having a head on killing four or five people and just breaks my heart because I know the technology exists to prevent that. And my daughters are 30 and 27 so I took them through a driver's training and it was an absolute nightmare to see an inexperienced driver. I mean, next time you do go through dry through a busy intersection, you're an experienced driver. Think of what you're sorting out all of the visual clutter that's there and what you really have to pay attention to to get through that intersection safely. And now you take a 15 year old kid who has never done it before. It's learning curve. Jeremy and W we've got to do better than this. We absolutely have to do better than those fatalities.

Speaker 1:          31:09          Yeah, yeah. I did like the, the way you can contrast the sort of the engineering cultures in Detroit and Silicon Valley through the book and they, you know, and they each have their strengths. And I think you, uh, I'm pretty sympathetic to the, uh, the Google software engineering culture, but you pointed out how, um, you know, maybe some of the Googlers needed to come to terms with it. The thing is Detroit is good at too.

Speaker 2:          31:35          Yeah. Yeah. The original title of the book was the race to build the driver's car. And um, uh, Alco who's our publisher or the Dcis, who's the editor of surgeries, he made one raise her hand, but she said, maybe you are right at about the quest. And that was really an important moment for myself and Chris Shogun because suddenly we realized, you know, maybe this isn't silicon valley versus Detroit. Maybe it's a bigger story than that. Early on when I first arrived as the, the gray haired executive at Google self driving cars, there was, um, I would say an arrogance and the team about Silicon Valley being able to handle these great world challenges at light speed and the auto industry had lost its way on innovation and really, really was no longer imaginative. It's the same time when Chris Urmson and Anthony's, I've endoscopy first went to Detroit looking for car companies and suppliers to collaborate with.

Speaker 2:          32:33          They basically threw them out the door, thought they were irresponsible with developing cars on public roads. There's this tension between the silicon valley culture and the Detroit culture where the story stands now where this quest stands now it's an end. It's not an or. Um, I think by hiring John Craft Chuck to lead Waymo, it was a recognition by alphabets leadership that they needed somebody with a lot of car experience to take this forward and commercialize it. And, and John was really, really deepened his car experience. And at, at at the same time, I think Ford and General Motors realize that they're going to have to reach out to silicon valley to outsource that our research and development and autonomous vehicle system. So GM acquired cruise automation and then Argo AI was acquired by Ford. So they've come together. It's a Silicon Valley and Detroit that will lead this forward.

Speaker 1:          33:26          Yeah, quite fascinating. I think another thing that kind of move the story along with some, you know, some combination of visionaries and, and um, and setting really audacious goals, right? These challenges both Darpa's challenges and then, uh, uh, you know, I guess Larry and Sergei setting challenges with Sebastian Thrun and others, you know, like what, what can you make happen here?

Speaker 2:          33:51          That's a great management principles, setting stretch goals. And when you're the person who has to reach the stretch, stretch goal, sometimes it can be a little bit frightening, but think about it this way. You could say your, um, you, you want to accomplish something on a scale of 10 and um, you can set your, your goal is six and get to seven and feel good about it. Or You could have set your goal at nine and get the eight and not get there. You'd rather be at eight than seven. So stretch goal is an important principle. The defense, advanced research projects, agency, Darpa, set stretch goals for the desert challenge, which of which were two. And then the goal for the urban challenge with 60 miles in a city setting with no one in the car, no remote control, obey all traffic laws and get it done in six hours and nobody thought it could be done.

Speaker 2:          34:44          So the Darpa challenge ends, everybody's feeling great about it. Tony Tether, the head of Darpa says, mission accomplished. Your guys have proven this can be done. It's up to the commercial sector to run with it. And we all thought people would be falling all over themselves wanting to take the next step to make it commercial. And nothing happened. Caterpillar reached out and started doing some work for mining applications. But we wanted to change the whole world of automobiles. Larry and Sergei, we're the only two leaders that stepped up. Larry and Sergei, they were at that race. Uh, they had a passion for this subject and Larry had a great conversation with Sebastian Thrun and said, Sebastian told Larry, we can't do this. We shouldn't do it, Sebastian, until Larry, I'm the best in this field. I know what I'm talking about. We shouldn't get into. And Larry said, I have to tell Eric and Sergei a real reason why we can't do it.

Speaker 2:          35:42          So he sends the bash and back the third time and finally sabbatical came back, said, well, maybe we can, and then they set these stretch goals. Think about this as a form of leadership. Larry wanted it to go on every road in California. So they negotiated that they would pick ten one hundred mile routes, you know, who laid out the routes, Larry and Sergei, and they put a bonus in place for the team to get this done in two years. So to Sebastian negotiates another goal a hundred thousand miles on public roads because they want to at least get a little bit of payment. This is really impressive leadership. And then they stuck with the team and the team got a done. And so there's a management lesson here. You have to set it far enough out where it's really hard to get there, but not so far out that it's impossible. And they've subsequently put additional goals on the Waymo team that they're working really, really hard on right now in Chandler, Arizona, tied to do people like riding in these cars. Can you do it safely? Is there a business here? All of that stuff. But it's really a good lesson in management.

Speaker 1:          36:49          Yeah. And I guess, uh, um, Tony and Darpa had the, the sort of the most challenging when he really had to stick to his guns, right? Because after the first urban challenge or the first desert challenge was supposed to be 150 miles and the best card did what, seven. Yeah.

Speaker 2:          37:04          Miles. And he had all this media stacked up at the finish line and nobody got there. So Tony goes to the finish line, he says, I got great news the next race and he is on this date and the prize is $2 million. He really driven it and this is a lot of money for these young teams competing for it.

Speaker 1:          37:24          Yeah. Yeah. I thought that was a great story. Like, you know, stick with this approach. Um, I was, I was also curious as need to like the, the engineering cultures are coming to appreciate the, you know, like what they have to offer each other. But you also, I think kind of made a point, at least in Detroit, right? The, there's actually a hierarchy of engineering teams, right? So that parts manufacturers and some of the parts manufacturers are as big as the, the auto companies know, sell the brand name. And so I sort of wonder what kind of hierarchy are we going to see in the future? I, you know, is um, is Uber the brand we're going to know or you know, or lift or Waymo is it going to be Toyota? Uh, you know, is there gonna be a lot of competition about that?

Speaker 2:          38:11          Oh, yes. There's going to be competition. First of all, there's a lot of different use cases for these brands. There's the use case of Uber's lifts without drivers. There's the use case of you basically leasing an autonomous vehicle and having a subscription service so that you're controlling it. So think about that. You, you say, I want one of these for 12 months and then I'm going to subscribe for 30,000 miles. It takes you to work, drops you off, you then it to go pick up your spouse, take him or her to work and drops them off and your spouse dispatches it to go pick up your kid at school for soccer practice and then mother-in-law for meals on wheels. So you may use this one dedicated vehicle to the point where you don't need that second and third car, but you're still going to have that control that you have.

Speaker 2:          38:55          So you've got that use case. Don't forget goods movement over the road trucking, there's shortage of truck drivers or truck drivers, 64 cents a mile and benefits and wages. And um, it's a tedious job. It takes people away from their home. So there's real value to be created there. And then finally that last mile of delivery, and I goodness, I work out of my Home Office. I've had two times where the ups truck and Fedex truck where my driveway at the same time I came home from golfing two weeks ago I had nine boxes on my porch. My wife has been busy. She's a hairstylist. She likes to get all this stuff over the internet. But that last mile, if you can get the driver out of the local delivery system, whether it's with drones or you name it, so a wide range of use cases. How are you going to brand that is important.

Speaker 2:          39:43          What are the experiences you're going to deliver is not just about going from point a to point B and getting there safely. It's does a pick me up on my precise location and drop me off precisely. Is the ride so nice that when I get out of the vehicle I feel better than when I got into it. Can I get to more places with brand a versus brand B? That's going to be a basis of competition. But the one place I think you want to be beyond anything else in this future ecosystem is to have the world's best driver because that world's best driver can plan every one of those use cases. And it's typically more than half the cost per mile that we incur today. So that's a big opportunity. Now, does this play out in a Microsoft kind of a business model or an intel inside business model or an arm business model?

Speaker 2:          40:31          Those decisions haven't been made yet. There's still a lot of work to do before you start scaling. I think the experiences are get branded. I personally think the car companies are going to have a tough time saying Chevrolet is the right brand for a mobility service. I think that's going to be a bit of a stretch. So I think you're gonna see some rebranding going on. It's going to be fun. All right. It's a, it's been great talking to you. I think I have to let everyone else ask them. Well thank you. Thank you. Thank you for reading the book or questions were excellent. And, um, certainly when you're an author you love it when someone will give you some of your time over the weekend. It's really nice, Jeremy, that he did that. The, I had great fun to read. Great Story. It just one thing for the Q and a. Um, I lost my hearing 20 years ago. I hear with cochlear implants and at the same technologies, autonomous cars, it's batteries and sensors and software and all of that stuff. I think I'll hear you fine, but if not, Jeremy, oh, help me with the questions. Go ahead. Hey Larry, thanks for coming to talk to us. I have a three year old at home

Speaker 3:          41:34          and uh, you know, I think about in 13 years is going to get his driver's license. What are the odds that he's going to get his driver's license?

Speaker 2:          41:42          No, I think the odds are pretty low. There's a lot of people who are enthusiastic about driving and you know, a hundred years ago there are a lot of people enthusiastic, a lot of horses and um, you know, there's still horse racing. There's still equestrian. The important message right now is not that we're going to say you can't drive, but for a lot of people were going to say you're going to get the accessibility, mobility benefits of owning and operating a car and not have to drive. So your, your, your, your child is going to be able to make a choice by the time they're 15 or 16. There's a lot of negatives with owning and operating a car beyond the safety rest, having a staff to a gas, having to find parking, having to get your car maintained, having a shop for, I'll have an insured and finance it and you put all that together and you say, man, that's a real hassle and this industry has existed for a century, assuming you're willing to do that and pay 35,000 bucks for a car. So I think that world's going to change quite a bit. Thank you. Thank you. Over here.

Speaker 3:          42:43          So I actually have two questions. The first one is a big downside of electric vehicles has always been distance per charge. Uh, what about taking a trip in the world that you are describing here? Uh, how would I go from New York City to buffalo to get some buffalo wings for the weekend? How does that play into what you're talking about, which is more, uh, you know, daily travel, commuting, they et cetera.

Speaker 2:          43:06          Yeah, that's an exciting question. The range of the batteries has increased significantly. Lay, the Chevrolet Bolt for example, has about 230 mile range. So we think the battery is sufficient for the everyday community kind of usage in this shared model going between communities. Um, you may have like a, a range extender that you could associate with this. I'm almost like a pod that snaps on the back, that's extra battery just when you need to make that trip that can extend your range and extend your power to do that. Uh, I wouldn't totally rule out hydrogen and fuel cells. I wish I never uttered the word fuel cell cars. This is just a hydrogen batteries and other kind of a battery. But that's its real advantage as you can fill up with hydrogen and have significant range. I do think when the, when the market's there, um, we're going to have the solutions in place to get you from a buffalo to New York City if that's where you want to go. One way ticket to buffalo though.

Speaker 3:          44:06          Ah, that's right. We can plug it in when we get, so we saw in the late nineties, early two thousands with the Evie one. For example, as you mentioned, the effect of the oil and gas lobbies. Um, and what, and their effect on the saturation of the electric vehicle as a whole in the United States. Has that changed at all? Are we at the point where we're ready to see a gas and oil cars off road or

Speaker 4:          44:32          are we still fighting that same battle?

Speaker 2:          44:34          I certainly can see a pathway to not need oil any longer in the transportation sector. I hesitated a bit. Um, diesel is a really good way to move. Hey, 80,000 pound load. So there may be some applications there, but I think for about 80% of the oil we can get off of that. Will we, um, the thing that keeps me up at night, quite honestly, I think what's going to gate all of those are those very powerful voices that have a vested interest in the hundred and 30 year old automobile roadway transportation system. The easiest thing to do in Washington DC is say no. And these companies who have something to lose from this are very good at knowing how to say no. So that does concern me. But technologically I think we're there. I think in terms of value proposition for all of us living in our everyday lives, I think where their business model, uh, investors wanting to put the money in this new future rather than where we've been, I think we're there now. It's just a matter of almost like the baseball movie field of dreams. If I build it, they will come and that's why I'm so proud to be part of Waymo, uh, as an advisor because that's what they're doing in Chandler has approving this thing out. Cool.

Speaker 4:          45:45          Thank you. Thank you. Yes. Hi. You mentioned that you view as sort of this market is being very competitive and I was just wondering how you think about like network effects have like Uber and Lyft. Basically their entire business model is just if you have all the drivers then you have all the passengers and you can, you know, be a monopoly I guess. How do you think about what the market will look like, whether you've used a transportation is centralizing and what, like regulatory or other options.

Speaker 2:          46:13          Very important questions. And one of the interesting part of results from the work I did at Columbia, not only did we get this 20 cent per mile opportunity identified, it turns out scale economies are reached at about 10% of the miles driven in a community. What I mean by that as if I had a shared fleet that I was running in Anarbor and I had 10% market share and then I went to 11% my cost per mile wasn't going down anymore. The suggests that, um, you don't need to have the entire market in order to, to have scale and be, and be competitive. With that said, there's definitely network effects there. There's definitely scaling affects those learning affects. I talk about having the world's best driver. One of the best ways to do that is to be learning for more and more and more vehicles on the road every day. And when the beauty of a driverless cars, when I learned something from one car, I can put it on all the other cars and make all of them safer. When I learned something as a human driver about how to do something better, I have no mechanism for transferring that to other human driver. So these things are real important and I think they're going to have to be watched, certainly not a reason not to go forward, but they're going to have to be managed for sure. Yeah.

Speaker 4:          47:26          Yes. Yeah. I'm very excited about driverless cars

Speaker 5:          47:30          and the certainly there's tremendous, uh, uh, future. There's one thing that worries me about its impact on freedom because a car was the greatest vehicle for freedom and opportunity. Uh, ability to go someplace is a great boon for humans. With now the way the driverless cars are being actual designed and implemented means we depend on cloud services and on provider of cloud services desired to enable my trip. Google decides not to map certain area in the car as well, not go to their Dra, uh, Google or better yet the government decides that certain event is not good. They can easily make cars not go to that event. And this is because we have no other way of doing things other than through the cloud servers. We don't treat, we will, uh, we will not really own anything even if we buy the, uh, the car. Yeah.

Speaker 2:          48:38          So yeah, I mean, first of all, the title of my book has autonomy because I believe this future is going to bring more freedom. Um, there was a lot of people today that can't benefit from an owning and operating an automobile. There are two younger driver, they're too old or they're not capable physically to do it. They can't afford it or whatever it might be. So we really think we're going to bring more freedom to a lot more people with this. If the concern that you raised, which is really kind of beyond my area of expertise. I, if you're concerned about that, I encourage you to go out and start working on it because we want this to be an enabler of much greater freedom rather than a constraint or a freedom. I think when you look at the hundred year history of the auto industry, a lot of that stuff was playing out as well.

Speaker 2:          49:22          Where were you going to build the road and where are we going to build a parking lot? And um, who pays for the roads and all of that. And I think we have created an extensive amount of uneven access and inequality in our mobility systems. I live north of Detroit in our neighborhoods in Detroit, still have a lot of poverty and these people can break out of the cycle of poverty because we don't have any transportation alternatives other than than a car. And the car insurance is off the charts expensive. So all of this has to be managed and talked about. And I'd encourage that dialogue to continue, I think. Great observation. Yes.

Speaker 6:          49:59          Hey, I was wondering if you thought that the influx of autonomous vehicles in cities, uh, will result in cities becoming more multimodal, more walkable, bikeable more mass transit with first, last mile, or if you thought it would just increase car dependence and creased the widening of roads, et cetera.

Speaker 2:          50:17          I think it's going to be the f the former. I mean, there's three parking spaces dedicated to every car in the United States and there's, you know, 250 million cars. So that's a lot of parking and that parking, um, constraints, densification. Um, I do want to make a point though, only 26% of Americans live in cities. 53% of Americans live in suburbs and that parking issue is even more severe there. Um, I on the board of a real estate development company in Florida and we had a parcel of land that we are developing along eyes 75 south of Tampa, St Petersburg. And they ended up putting a, um, um, Walmart on that site. But the amount of land for parking was twice the amount of land for the building. And this is nuts. And so I think this is an opportunity to really drive densification. And secondly, the vehicles are dramatically better at detecting pedestrians, detecting bicyclists, and taking a lot of the risk out of the system for vulnerable road way users. I sometimes talk about this. You've heard the concept of secondhand smoke. I'd like to talk about secondhand physics for some reason. There's a belief that somebody can drive a 5,000 pound Cadillac as escalate I one of the streets in Manhattan and go 45 miles an hour. And it's that second hand physics. I mean, it's just kinetic energy. So we've got to work through it. But I, I'm in the camp where I think we're going to make cities more livable, but very importantly, I think we're going to improve suburbs a lot too.

Speaker 6:          51:50          So the whole driverless car thing seems, reminds me a lot of the Internet in the 1980s nineties, 90s, a lot of innovation and exciting things. One of the things that happened sort of after that time in the Internet is we discovered there's a lot of malefactors out there. And, um, one of the things that I haven't heard anyone in this industry really talking about too much is how do you defend, uh, and make secure your driverless car, not only against the kind of attacks that are already taking place against, you know, automated but driver full cars, but against jamming or other kinds of attacks on the sensors and things like that, which, you know, nobody is doing that now. It's wonderful. Everybody's cooperating mostly, but you know, that doesn't last forever.

Speaker 2:          52:40          Yeah. Yeah. Low cybersecurity area again, is not my expertise. I talked to people who understand a better than I do and we've got a lot of people working on that hard. It's not an issue that's unique to driverless cars. It also exists in human driven cars or current curves are very vulnerable to be hacked. It's, it's part of other systems we use in our daily lives. They are airline system and other things. And so I assure the concern. Um, but not to the, and I'm not implying you're suggesting this, but not to the point where it says we shouldn't be pushing this opportunity to its full extent. I believe the way to go at this is to think big and certainly Google self driving cars and Google alphabet are thinking very big in this space. Start small. 13 Prius says, get out and start learning on public roads.

Speaker 2:          53:31          Learn fast. We've been learning fast now for almost a decade and it's been extraordinary insights and then scale smart. I don't think anyone's going to want to scale a system that has the vulnerabilities that, that you're concerned with. We're going to have to have solutions to that. Should that be the first problem to fix? I don't know. I, you know, I don't think solving snow storms on Loveland pass at nighttime was the first thing to work on. And driverless cars, we may never solve that one, but I think we've got to get out there and learn. So I have one more question. One more please.

Speaker 6:          54:04          Oh, okay. So just where does it start in a big way. I mean, uh, you know, of course it makes sense to focus on the, the desired end state of, of changing the car experience for Americans. But uh, it does it actually start in some more limited domain, I dunno, long haul trucking or enthusiasts or early adopters or CD centers where there's restricted access for other kinds of vehicles or what?

Speaker 2:          54:32          Yeah, I think those use cases are very exciting places to start. A gated communities, campuses, those speed applications. The interesting thing about over the road trucking is not all freeway links are created the same. Some are flat, um, straight, nice weather, low traffic density, much easier to get started with his business. Then some of the curve, you're a higher traffic area so it's not going to be just, we suddenly take it and deploy it on a large scale in a major metropolitan area. I think you're going to see a whole bunch of these smaller plays done. Uh, as we work hard. No one's saying we're ready to commercialize this at scale. What we are saying is we believe that technology is reaching a point where there's commercial consumer value to be had. And I think with any startup, you want to get to that point. You want to get real customers want to get real money coming in that that's what we're in the business to do. But I think these opportunities to talk about are, are there. Great. Okay. Thanks so much. Thanks everybody.

Speaker 7:          55:37          [inaudible].
