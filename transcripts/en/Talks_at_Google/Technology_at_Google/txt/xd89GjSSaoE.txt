Speaker 1:          00:05          With that very humbling introduction, kind of rounding applause from Robbie Brown. Wow. I like to meet that guy. He sounds really impressive. Uh, thank you. Uh, first of all, uh, thanks to Google for hosting all of us here today, um, and the campus that you're building here in boulders is beautiful and we're all very happy to have you in our city and, and in our state. Um, as I said, my name is Bobby Brown and I'm the dean of the College of Engineering and Applied Science at the University of Colorado Boulder. Uh, we are among the fastest growing engineering colleges and we're actually one of the most diverse colleges of engineering in the country. And that's something that we're really proud about, uh, because it allows us to reach out and partner more with industry in our state and including, uh, Google. Uh, I'm a Mars Guy, um, uh, I guess, uh, maybe a Martian, uh, in, in my blood and I've worked on a number of, uh, NASA missions and typically I work with engineers and scientists on what it's like to build and send spacecraft to Mars.

Speaker 1:          01:14          Uh, but today I'm here with a really interesting group of people, uh, people who I've had the pleasure to work with, uh, for a number of years now, uh, in, uh, what's been a groundbreaking a television series put on by National Geographic with executive producers, Ron Howard and Brian Grazer. Uh, and, uh, I got to tell you, working with these people, it's been like, like a family. Uh, and for me as an engineer, uh, perhaps the best thing has been working with a, not with other engineers but with artists and, uh, you know, a film studies folks, actors, writers and big thinkers, uh, from across the spectrum, uh, that had been part of this innovative docu drama. How many of you have seen any of the episodes a season one or season two? Yeah, that's a good number. That's a good number. It's season two's going on right now. Uh, we just, uh, just last night, episode four, uh, was premiered on Nat Geo.

Speaker 1:          02:20          Uh, they're showing a Monday nights, 9:00 PM. You can catch up with those and you can, uh, uh, actually see episode five and six have yet to come out tonight on our campus at cu boulder. Uh, we'll be premiering a episode five. You can see it on campus a week before a, it'll actually be shown worldwide. Uh, so that's what we're all here today. We're here for this event. Uh, and then for this evening's event in boulder. Uh, I'm here today, joined with a number of the members of the show, uh, in various capacities, uh, going, uh, from my, uh, going down this way. I always, I always mess that up. My left, but it's there, right? Let's do it that way. Uh, the first new corrects me the most in my life is actually Steven Channick who, uh, you know, over the years has been a great friend.

Speaker 1:          03:17          Uh, Steven is a co executive producer of the series, and in fact, the series is based on a book, uh, that Steven wrote years ago about how we will actually live and settle the planet Mars. Uh, he's really the creative genius behind the whole series, if you will, uh, through his book. And it's wonderful to have you here in boulder today. Uh, next to him is Antonia. You Haas, uh, who is an expert in oil and energy policy, uh, and has written numerous papers and, and given numerous forums on those topics, uh, in this series. Uh, she's a big thinker. So this is a series, right? That goes back and forth between the present and the future, right? So you, we talk about what's happening in our world today and then we flash forward from that into how that might might portray into a human settlement of Mars in the future.

Speaker 1:          04:14          And Antonio has been wonderful in providing insights about climate and energy, uh, and policy, international policy issues here on the earth and how those might, those same kind of issues might play out on March. And then next to her is actually an award winning writer, uh, Leonard David, uh, who, if you're in the space community like I am, Leonard needs a no introductions. Uh, but Leonard has written a book that is a companion book to the National Geographic series. If you're interested, you can pick one up, uh, on the back table, uh, there, uh, but Leonard's book, uh, is, is a great companion to the series, provides wonderful context about past, present, and future Mars exploration. Uh, and so we're here today. Uh, what we're going to do is we're going to, uh, watch, uh, the trailer from season one just to bring you up to speed about what happened two years ago during season one, uh, which, which took place in the 2030s a. Then we're going to show the trailer for season two. Uh, but before I do, there's two other folks I definitely want to introduce very quickly, uh, in the audience who will be speaking tonight on campus. Uh, and there are actors, uh, in the Nat Geo series and that Sammy road TV, maybe Sam, you want to stand up? Oh,

Speaker 2:          05:33          and Evan Hall. And as someone

Speaker 1:          05:40          who's, uh, consulted, uh, on the show and worked with some of the writers and actors in the production of the show, you know, they've been fantastic. Uh, you know, the, the, these guys, it just, their roles are so, it's amazing how well they suited into these roles. I know that you each have an engineering background and you know, you have multiple engineering degrees from cu boulder. I'm just kidding. Uh, but you know, from watching you on the show, I mean, one would think, uh, that you did and it's actually amazing. I, I spoke to you for a seat. Yeah. So it's been a lot of back and forth getting ready to do that. But that's what's made this show I think so unique is that it's a scientifically honest show. It's a scientifically accurate portrayal of what the future might look like based on what's happening right now, uh, in space, uh, exploration. Uh, so what we do is jump into the, uh, the clips. The first, this is season one. Tamara's will be risky, dangerous, but it will be the grease

Speaker 3:          06:48          adventure ever, ever in human history. Funny thing about Mars, it feels like birth. It is more hostile to life. Any place on earth, in the absence of gravity, lots of things can go wrong. It's an unknown. And you're basically allowing yourself to be an experiment. Well coming in too fast, landing hazard, four and a half, just firing it. The question is, will you be able to survive during this crucial time of arrival losing him? These people are putting their bodies at risk for us, for the human race. When we get to Mars, we need protection from radiation, unmanned aerial vehicles. We use a sense of drones to find a lover Tube with the conditions we need to deploy a small dam habitat and that little foothold will become humankind's first real home beyond the gravity, well, Olympus town. If I push this modification any farther, we risk overloading the entire electrical system. We don't have a choice.

Speaker 2:          08:06          What did you do?

Speaker 3:          08:10          If the topography is right in the isis there we can justify the planet can, okay, not scared of the dark.

Speaker 2:          08:16          Okay.

Speaker 3:          08:21          If there was water on Mars, couldn't there possibly be lying?

Speaker 4:          08:32          Medical lab is now curation. The greenhouse is complete. We at MMC field that we're ready to go faster. Phase two expansion will be overseen by the very best. Our dream is now a reality. You guys up for a welcoming committee base commander and son, and then two months we'll have enough power to double the size and capacity of your facilities.

Speaker 3:          08:56          It's a little too ambitious right now. Young, go to march with that ambition. I don't think we didn't get a chance to get that reaction. Okay.

Speaker 2:          09:05          If you've got a dust storm that lasted for a month, you'd be in big trouble.

Speaker 3:          09:08          This asking, ranging form up. They call it a season. I don't do my job. Who is going to have a real problem is based. Ultimately, there are some people who are going to have a really hard time. Well, I miss getting to everyone. Are you missing home? I'm okay. He lifts for his work and he can't do it. Darling Paul Richardson House has to be buried. Our friends, the fate of the mission

Speaker 5:          09:45          earth.

Speaker 2:          09:46          If you send astronauts to Mars and they die, their public opinion will prohibit you from ever doing it again.

Speaker 3:          09:53          Took them to be strong, to make a statement that says, we're here to stay. Seven of the world's most beloved scientists and astronauts are dead. You're not going to have someone's plan recommendation.

Speaker 5:          10:00          The committee when we thought he could only get darker, there was flight.

Speaker 2:          10:07          We have been talking about life on Mars for ever.

Speaker 3:          10:11          That's like, I'm not gonna like crystal. Have you had an iPhone? Something? Just think about what it would mean if you found a single cell micro organism today marks the end of an era and the beginning of a new one here would be so exciting to wake up in the morning and think that that's, that's why it's happening. There is life on Mars man or been coming to Maria would be plans for his planet. Scientists for Galt, sick minus with the advancement of Sciences. Hums industry. When you look after your water and your buyer, sorry, I as such is becoming irrelevant on your watch. Mars private enterprise. Yes. It's uncomfortable. When we talk about what we're doing on Mars, we're really talking about what we think is okay to do here on this planet. What's your same drill baby drill? I'm a Safa struck a deal with Luke from industry hit the minus what they want. Yes, they're doing a job, but they also are creating wines for themselves. Okay, ma'am, ma'am, I'm pregnant. It's not like a plan. This. No, you just plan to leave. If we go to Mars, you don't want any surprises. Does a baby is born on Mars? Could never live here. Oh God got talking about. We're ahead and technology and workers will be pushed faster than they should be pushed. Let me help them and those errors have disastrous consequences.

Speaker 3:          11:47          We cause a sense they proved just as challenging as it does on earth. Do you see something? Come on then what we're looking for, we think we're going to let you and your calling. You're one crazy bitch. You know if there's a place you've never been, there's a scientist wants to know what's their companies want access to new territory. At the same time, we have a counter movement that says we are not going down without a fight. Mazda's core though is willing to accept a much higher level of of danger. Solar flare. It's taken out of electrical pride. Our entire communications. She could freeze to death before we find her.

Speaker 3:          12:25          We've disrupted the environment to creating new conditions where diseases can spread. What do we got? Something at the site has been making them sick. Stop the drilling. When's governments are hiding an outbreak? That's one of the virus is actually, yeah, winning what? You'd be walking straight into the sauce. The only one who knows this science. She's not breathing. I need help. It's my opinion that this colony requires new leadership colony just engaged and in this town to the it or not get a chance. People would lie, cheat, and steal to make sure that the mission was successful. Even if that costs a lot of human lives. Take hold this and I'll do mine. They've taken advantage of us at every turn and you let it happen. Will we make mistakes on Mars? Yes. There's show for it. You see something that has unimaginable wealth and you want to go get it and we're getting water today initiating final prep before designation that comes with an asterisk. Space exploration. It's where we solve problems that have never been solved before for you. Okay? With what he's doing. Can you find life but not at the expense of it. Nothing is a clean slate. We impose ourselves on everything. The future of humanity is very much in the solar system. What kind of civilizations are we going to bill?

Speaker 1:          14:08          Ah, so what you saw there, uh, was it just a brief recap of season one, which was, you know, all about the initial settlement. Uh, the, the scientific undertaking that that initial settlement was about a basic survival in that settlement. And then in season two, a, the expansion, the inevitable expansion, uh, as industry comes in and, uh, some of the personal challenges and conflicts that arise, uh, between, you know, science objectives and industry objectives, um, many of which play out in this world all the time, uh, that we are portraying in the future on Mars. Um, and so with that, um, as kind of background, we could start a Q and. A. Um, and so, uh, I actually have a question prepared for each of the panelists. Uh, but um, you are welcome to ask questions as well. Um, I might, you know, give you a little heads up that we're going to be asking the audience for questions in just a minute, but let me start, uh, we'll just go this way. Let me start with you, Steven. That's okay. Um, that's all the questions and we'll talk about terraforming later, but let's start out just by talking about what it's like for you personally, uh, to see this creation put together by this wonderful team of actors and writers, producers, uh, all based on that, you know, relatively small book that you wrote, very important but small in size, a book that you wrote. Uh, how's that, how's that feel and how do you think the portrayal has gone in terms of accuracy?

Speaker 6:          15:56          Good. Um, well, what's the big shock? I've been, I'm a science journalist my whole life and, um, and I've never been kind of buffered up against the Hollywood syndrome. So when we first got involved in this project and the book was first optioned by radical media, um, there were all kinds of twists and turns that were kind of crazy. I'm like getting space x to cooperate with us. Um, which was a very difficult problem initially. Um, and then seeing how this concept of storytelling was far more important to anyone in on the west coast than the facts where to anyone on the east coast where I was. So there was kind of this thing going on between us and, and my role quickly became not just explaining as was Bobby's role, uh, initially and in the show, not just explaining to the film, making people in the actors and so forth, what the real facts were about being on Mars and the kinds of scenarios you could have.

Speaker 6:          17:04          And you couldn't have, for example, I will never forget a phone call from the director, um, uh, in the first season. And we were talking about, I'm actually leaving earth and going to Mars and the trip. And they said, okay, somebody's got to die on this. How are they going to die? So I gave him like five scenarios from my favorite scenario was that a small meteoroid, um, would pass through the rocket and they said, no, we don't like that. And then I gave him a couple of other scenarios. Now we don't like that and a game a couple of days, no, I don't like that. And uh, it was like, well, wait a minute, you know, um, what kind of scenario do you want? And they would give me one and I would say that isn't physically possible in space. So, um, initially there was, there was, there was a lot of, you know, conflict of buffering. I'm trying to come up trying to get the people who wanted to do the storytelling and we're very good at it, um, to adapt to the physical realities of the universe.

Speaker 6:          18:06          But in the end it worked out great. And, um, one of the things that really surprised me was that both the actors and the directors, um, we're really eager to learn. Like when I first met the initial group of actors, every single one of them had read the book. Some of them had read the book two or three times. And the book served as kind of a primer because it kind of laid out all the facts of, you know, what it would be like on Mars, what it would be like getting there, what are, you know, it's very science based and very fact based. And they really, they really absorbed that and wanted to learn that. So it's been a lot of fun. Um, Anna and I've learned an awful lot, you know, I thought as a journalist and as a writer and as an editor and you know, I used to be a, um, kind of a writer's editor who worked with really long form kind of stories that you would, the kind of stories you would see in the New Yorker or the New York Times Sunday magazine. You know, I thought I knew everything that I was ever going to need to know about storytelling and this new dimension, which is visual, um, taught me an awful lot and it taught me an awful lot about scene setting and words as well as sin in visuals and carrying through a storyline. So, um, I'm very grateful for the whole.

Speaker 1:          19:26          All right. Thank you. Thanks a Antonio. Uh, first of all, welcome back to boulder. You're a hometown from here. Nice. Yeah. Great. Yeah. Um, you play a extremely important role in season two as one of the big thinkers. Uh, and, and in fact your insights in the show, you know, personally I have found fascinating, um, you know, the drilling on Mars, drilling on earth and you know, kind of parallels and challenges. Uh, in that vein, can you talk a little bit more about how you, how you view what we've, what we're doing today presently to the earth and on the earth, how you view that playing out, uh, in the future on Mars? Sure.

Speaker 7:          20:13          Yeah, it is great to be home. I live in San Francisco now, but I grew up in boulder, so it's really great to be back here and see the brand new campus. And thanks for all of you for being here. So as you saw on the previews, what's really exciting, one of the things that's really exciting about the show is I do think this model is entirely unique and, uh, just revolutionary way of storytelling, which is the hybrid of the documentary and the drama. So they're interlaced, as you saw it, you've got the dramatic series in the future on Mars and then you have the documentary and you go back and forth between the two. And both sets become characters in a way. Like you want to know, I think, what, not only what's going to happen to the characters in the drama, but what the next big thinker is going to say because you also become invested in them.

Speaker 7:          20:55          Cause they're carried through the storyline, the documentary storyline as well. But in the first season, the documentary is basically about, you know, the science of getting to Mars in the second season. The documentary is really about, um, what are the unforeseen consequences that we've treated as unforeseen consequences on earth. That has led us to a devastation of our ability to cohabitate with this planet. And will we follow those same, uh, failures as we go to the next planet and trying to learn those lessons. And that's basically, you know, from my perspective, or at least my role in the documentary and my role is about, is looking at the failure of resource extraction on earth. And will the failure of resource extraction on earth be carried forward. And the failure of resource extraction on earth is really well embodied in oil extraction. And so that's sort of the tool that's followed in season two.

Speaker 7:          21:52          As you saw, green peace is followed as they go head to head with oil drilling in the Arctic with the outcome of oil drilling, um, in the small peninsula of the Russian Arctic and in the drilling platform and the Norwegian Arctic. Um, and you know, I think what is really some of the crux of the storyline and how I have summarized the two seasons from my own perspective is the first season is looking at Willmar's kill the humans that go there. And the second season is, well, the humans kill Mars. And that is looking at what's, what's going to happen when and if this, um, major industry comes and the depiction of the industry in lucrum industries, um, is really incredibly spot on in the way it's written in the portrayal of the actors in the difficulties they face. And the, and the decision to, um, you know, as, um, Jeff, uh, who, who's the actor in the clip says, you know, drill baby, drill quoting, Sarah Pailin.

Speaker 7:          23:04          Um, and, and I think that the lessons are really well embodied in both sets of stories. Um, one of the critical issues that's raised, you know, is there life on Mars, one of the big challenges that happens with oil drilling, um, what, what, what, what one sees over and over and over again with oil drilling. The history of the last 150 years of oil drilling is the drilling goes first. And only afterwards that we then learn, oh wait, there was this really critical natural resource. Uh, there was this group of people who lived here. Um, you know, there were all sorts of consequences that only get thought of as an afterthought. And one of the best examples of that in Arctic drilling, which I think is a good parallel to what could happen on Mars is something that seems really inconsequential. And that's phyto plankton. It just looks like a seaweed, but it turns out that phyto plankton, if you destroy it, it provides 50% of the oxygen we need to live on the planet. So treating it as a sort of inconsequential thing is one of the reasons why we're facing the problem that we're facing right now. And so trying to learn the lesson, which is maybe, um, consider the consequences first, longterm consequences first, and just go, you know, go in, uh, it go in second with the, uh, you know, blind pursuit of the,

Speaker 1:          24:29          of the resource. That's great. Yeah. Thank you. Thank you. Uh, Leonard. So, um, you know, great for you to be here today, Leonard. Uh, so, uh, you know, our interaction dates back to actual, you know, space flight missions, right? And I'm typically used to seeing Leonard David articles written, uh, about insight or about Mars 2020. So I spelled his name right all the way back to Mars Pathfinder in the nineties. Right. So I'm very interested in your opinion of this show, which is a portrayal of a future mission, uh, because I know that you've very accurately covered, uh, so many existing missions. Uh, can you comment on that briefly?

Speaker 8:          25:14          Well, you know, I think one thing, it strikes me the drill baby drill thing before I forget, that's also a Christmas k line. He's a Mars scientist and he wants a drill subsurface to look for life to look for. So it's, um, and the atmosphere is changing. I love that. Um, subtitle because this morning I got up and I looked at insight. We just landed on Mars few days ago. Uh, Cyrus racks pulls up at an asteroid yesterday. The Japanese space agency has a, uh, another asteroid mission that's uh, uh, also on, on target. Three people left the earth the other day. They hedge to the space station. Um, space x just hurled out, you know, 60 some satellites out at one rocket and then flew the, boosts your back. And I think that's atmosphere changing. I've never seen so much activity in the last week, uh, and in something something's going on here, and it's not just the NASA, but it's, it's a global effort.

Speaker 8:          26:27          And when you think about what's coming for Mars, we have, uh, a Mars 20, 20, the NASA super cute curiosity rover, um, that'll take off. And the 20, 20 a China's going to launch a Mars mission of robotic mission, same time period. Uh, the UAE, they're going to be launching a Mars orbiter. Um, uh, it's absolutely incredible what's happening. And Mars is, you know, it's, it's dangerous. It's, it's destiny. You know, for me, I've always felt that Mars was a, from a kid, uh, covering early Mars missions, uh, Viking, particularly in 1976. That was just a thrill. The first pictures come back and of course you're looking, you want to see rabbits running around up there and whatever. And I just remember the one guy, I think it was a, I can't remember his name now, but he, there's rocks there have rocks on Mars. Okay. Not quite rabbits, but it was good enough for me. But yeah, the whole, the, you know, the future is now, I just, I, I really, uh, honesty got last in the last week and a half. How many things have happened? Unbelievable. Okay. That's true. Um, I mean it's a, it's a whole new era of space exploration right now. Yeah. Uh, in the U S it's not only the government, right? There's companies, they're doing things on their own. It's incredible. Um, so, um, let's, let's see what kind of questions you all have for us. Um, anybody want to go first?

Speaker 9:          28:09          Okay.

Speaker 6:          28:10          Uh, less of a technology question, but I was just curious that where you do the majority of your filming and how much is CGI versus how much is the actual physical sets? There's a $15 million worth of sets in Budapest right now. They're all packaged up. They were in a, a container building, um, is typical of Hollywood sets that you could have parked about seven and seven. 47, 10.

Speaker 8:          28:36          MMM.

Speaker 6:          28:38          Built the largest green screen ever in the history of movie making so that we could go to Morocco and photograph where rovers, Nasa Rovers who tested because it actually looks like, and it was a lot like the surface of Mars. Then project that on the screen, then have the actors in front of that screen. That's kind of remarkable stuff that they've done. They built full size sets for the first season. When I was walking through the sets, I mean you, you really can begin to think you're on Mars and just a few minutes because it's, things are so realistic. Down to there was a little container in a hallway and the sets and the first season on Mars and I picked it up and looked at it and it was his container that supposedly something had been brought to Marson and it had like six different labels on it, you know, approved by inspectors such and such, uh, and, and Houston and stuff like that.

Speaker 6:          29:31          I mean down to the level that the camera would never pick up. Um, the sets were so elaborate and so exacting because it allows the actors to get into role and really feel like that there. So, um, we, we unfortunately lost our spot in Budapest. Budapest has now become a very popular place to make movies in many movies that you think are British or American or actually made in Budapest these days. And, uh, we're probably gonna move to Bucharest for the, for the next season if there's a next season. But, um, because it's cheaper to make films there, but, uh, the, it's pretty elaborate stuff, you know, it's the stuff of making real movies, um, as opposed to just a documentary series. So the investment in this has been extraordinary. I think for the first season, the sets where there were $5 million worth of sets and for the second season they had another $10 million from the sets and they, the second season, the sets are just huge compared to the first season. So, and I think if there's a third and a fourth season, it will grow in that way. Who Decides on that? How does, how does that happen? Vice President said, Fox question in the middle there. So we've been imagining Mars colonization for years and years and years. I'm thinking about today, what things on challenges had we anticipated before and that we're now better able to deal with? And what new challenges have we discovered that we didn't foresee back then?

Speaker 1:          31:05          That's probably for you. Well, I'll start, but you can always add in a, so I would, I would argue that we've made great progress in determining how to land big things on Mars. So a, and this is an area that I've worked in most of my career. Um, and if you had asked me 10 years ago, you know how we were gonna land humans on Mars, I would have said know, I dunno. Um, there were a lot of ideas out there 10 years ago or even 20 years ago. There were a lot of kind of cartoon drawings that showed how one might do that, but none of that technology had been proven. Uh, and recently I'm actually here on the earth. We've done a lot to prove those technologies. So, one example would be, um, you know, when space ex, uh, returns, the first stage boosters that they've done successfully over 30 times, now a way up high in the atmosphere, when they're bringing that booster back, they call out something called an entry burn.

Speaker 1:          32:11          And that burn, uh, takes place supersonically in Mars relevant conditions because you're up so high, you're up around 100,000 feet or higher when that burned takes place and a, what they're doing is they're, they're firing their jets, uh, in opposite to the direction of the velocity. So opposing free stream, uh, and that's something that actually people have talked about a lot, but until space x had a need to do that, no one had ever done that in Mars relevant conditions. And as I've said, they've done it for a big piece of hardware. They've done it 30 times or more successfully. You don't see that because it happens so high. You see the booster coming down, you know, right on the drone ship. And that's exciting too. Uh, but for those of us that are focused on Mars, we all work. We care about what happened at 40 kilometers or so out to, to uh, also at, through the robotic program.

Speaker 1:          33:06          I mean, you know, I started my career by landing Mars Pathfinder on the surface. It landed a little rover called sojourner that was about the size of a baby. It weighed, it was 11 kilograms in mass. And you know, uh, Mars science laboratory is the size of a small car, right? It's a nuclear powered car with a laser on it, right? Then we landed in 2012 and that, uh, by the way in 2020, we're going to land much more accurately. We're going to land basically in a football field instead of in a 20 kilometer safe zone. So, um, you know, and that, that kind of accuracy is required to build up a base camp, right? If you, in the series you see that there've been many landings and, and in order to build up this base camp, those many landings have to happen in close proximity to each other to get all that hardware together.

Speaker 1:          34:02          Uh, and that's a technology that we're improving. Uh, I think our ability to keep people, you know, alive frankly, and to keep them safe so that they can live, play and work in space. Uh, both in the micro gravity environment of space and on another planet has been greatly enhanced by what we're doing on the international space station today. A lender and mentioned the three astronauts that just went, but they joined three others that are already there. And you know, we've had people, you know, from our planet in space continuously since 2001 think about that. Not the same people, but uh, I mean that's a remarkable achievement for our planet. And it's not just Americans, right? They're international astronauts included in that. And to think that we've lived off of our world continuously, some smallest subset of us have done so continuously and safely since 2001 a that tells you something about the reliability of the system.

Speaker 1:          35:07          The cruise systems needed to keep people safe about food processing, about water processing, radiation shielding, all of the kinds of technologies that you see played out in this series. They're happening today. And then the last piece that I'll mention and I'll see if you want to add to that is, is really correct. It is just the advancement of industry, frankly in this country. Uh, it's one thing for our government, uh, to be talking about sending humans back to the, it's great, you know, exciting thing. Um, you know, to repeat something like the Apollo missions from the 1960s, you know, it would be a fantastic achievement for our country, but what really impresses me and gets me going gets my juices going is the industry capabilities in this country at places like space x or you know, right here in Colorado at Lockheed Martin, uh, or what's going on, you know, with blue origin or virgin galactic, uh, all of these companies that are on their own contributing to the space economy, uh, planet labs that, you know, is basically building almost a real time Google earth. Right? Um, I, you know, it's remarkable what's happening in space today and I think that capability is required for us to efficiently and cost effectively, uh, go to Mars.

Speaker 6:          36:36          I think from a tactical point of view of one of the most interesting things about going to Mars is that most of the technology that you needed to do this has been available for at least 30 years. So I like to say 40 years, but probably 30 years. Um, there's a, there's a device on the new curiosity rover that's going up in 2020 called Moxie that we'll split the carbon atom off this CO2 atmosphere of Mars and create enough oxygen, um, for uh, one human being to breathe consistently. For example, that machine is supposed to be scaled, is designed to be scaled up by a factor of a hundred. I think NASA originally wanted that machine so that they could have an oxidizer on Mars to make rocket fuel for a return trip in the future. But in fact, that machine is probably going to turn out to be the machine that makes the oxygen that people need to breathe on Mars.

Speaker 6:          37:30          I'm not quite sure what they're going to use for the rest of them in their gas. The other 78%, that is still a technical problem. But what's amazing is that all this stuff, you know, we made this decision to stay in earth orbit a long, long time ago. It's the Apollo program was coming to an end and we decided to build a space shuttle, which is supposed to be cheap and reusable and it turned out to cost about doubled over a billion dollars for each flight. And we have not kind of reached out and extended what we're capable of doing. We haven't gone back to the moon, which I think would be kind of a waste, but we haven't, we haven't taken a bold step like we did in the Apollo program and decided to, let's just go to Maurice because we've, and yet we've had this capability to do this for so long.

Speaker 6:          38:18          And to touch on one other thing that both Leonard and Bobby have touched on spaces. The next big business, it isn't an accident that you see all these things happening in, in the, in the last week or so, the Russians have committed to going to Mars and putting a human on Omar. The Chinese have to putting a human on Mars. Both the Russians and the Chinese have committed to put humans on the moon again. Uh, NASA has committed just recently to putting humans on the moon again. Um, and yet as Bobby says, there are all these private companies that could actually do it. Maybe even before any of these governments could do it. Companies like space x, which actually intend to do it before a government does it. This is the next big business, you know, lassoing the SLS launch system and the, and the Orion capsule on that. NASA has built, one of the original things they wanted to do with that literally was the go out and find a near Earth asteroids and Lasso it and bring it back and put it in orbit around the moon so that commercial companies could practice mining it. That's real. That's real technology that we have now that we're capable of doing this is it's just going to be mind blowing how this stuff expands and it's expanding a lot because of the commercial aspects of space. It's really going to be a big business.

Speaker 7:          39:39          Yeah. I mean, I think that's the perfect place to chime in. I think that what's, what is happening very rapidly is the, is the movement towards securing ownership of resources. What it, who's going to own the resources. And the only existing international architecture was the um, Moon Treaty, 67 space, outer space, 1967 treaty. And the goal was to not have a militarized space. That was the goal of that treaty. It was a peace treaty. Now it's being written our attempts, there's already national legislation that's happened in the United States and other attempts that are being written to define ownership of what you would mind in space. Who owns it, who gets to profit from it. And that's all being driven right now by private companies period. Um, and that is a similar model, which is will the private companies gain ownership of asteroids and the rights to mine asteroids and other planets and what they get there and how they do it. And we'll a regulatory regime only catch up afterwards after it's happening. And if that happens, are the unintended consequences of mining asteroids being thought through by the people who are intending to do the mining or will that be an afterthought? Um, and so a cirrus rex, one of its goals, this is the, the mission, um, that Leonard just mentioned that just yesterday successfully, um,

Speaker 6:          41:02          got the better it doesn't, doesn't it? Yeah.

Speaker 7:          41:04          Got they're covering up. I'm one of its goals is, is to determine the viability of asteroid mining. That's one of the intentions. And so, you know, for someone like me who has spent her career looking at, you know, the sort of follow, um, follow the, the industry goes forward and sort of regulations attempt to follow afterwards and what the consequences of those are. Thinking about it now for me, this entirely new realm, which is, you know, all of space and what the unintended consequences could be is truly profound and trying to encourage the public to participate in this process as much as industry is. Um, you know, before the cat gets much further out of the bag

Speaker 8:          41:47          there, there was uh, some kind of line and I don't think I came up with it. I stole it from somebody probably, but it was uh, it was the, you know, you, you do the, the peaceful uses of outer space and then somebody says,

Speaker 8:          42:02          uh, the useful, what, how is this going now? I can't remember what I'm talking about. Okay. Yeah. Useful pieces of outer space. Yeah. And that's interesting. I have a little quick, short story. I used to go every time there was a Mars mission, I go to JPL had a time, go talk to all the engineers and one time I went in there and this was on Pathfinder Guy, the head guy. He goes and puts me in his office and shuts the door and he says, this fails, how will you guys report on this? And I said, well, how is this really gonna work? He said, we're using the airbags. Airbags. Okay, let's see how that one goes. That mission was the first time I ever heard of co location, which is what you folks do here. And that was why it succeeded. They had people co located in the same buildings to talk to each other. People that were working on the parachute, um, for a month would all sudden be going over to another part of the, the wheels of the rover. And they, each person learn more about their, um, spacecraft. But that was called call location. And then I went back a couple years ago for curiosity. Landed, how are you going to land that? Oh, I'm a sky crane. It'll be dropped down on a tether and you're going, I'm still buying drinks on that one because I

Speaker 7:          43:34          all right, I can't. And that to me, you know, that,

Speaker 8:          43:39          uh, the partnership that has to develop between people in these missions to make things happen is baton passing a space, age baton passing. And each person contributes to the whole. And it's pretty amazing to watch

Speaker 10:         43:57          true

Speaker 7:          43:59          what work needs to be done before we can actually send humans to Mars.

Speaker 8:          44:04          Hmm. Not much of anything. Um, it's a problem of money. Um,

Speaker 6:          44:10          mosque estimates that it's 36 below 35, $36 billion to land the first humans on Mars. He doesn't have $36 billion. If he did, I think he'd probably start launching cargo missions does a year. You need, you need about three cargo missions to land successfully on Mars. Bobby and a lot of people from NASA think the first cargo landing that space x attempts on Mars will probably fail. And uh, and they think that they will learn. Huh?

Speaker 3:          44:39          Not probably a lot of, a lot of people that I've talked to, NASA seem to think it will probably fail in my opinion. I'm going to jump in. All right. All right. So what I've said is that if you need three, you should send for, right. Just, you know, before you send the humans, cause one of them may, may, yeah, go ahead. But anyway, there's a lot

Speaker 6:          45:03          to be learned from those failures. Extraordinary. I mean you probably learn if you have a successful landing and part of it is luck. That's not a learning experience. If you have a failure and you learn a lot from the failure and then you don't make the same mistakes again, um, things work a lot better in the future. So what I suspect is going to happen is that, um, as soon if Tesla, it becomes as successful as it should be. If mosque is able to launch 7,000 communication satellites and offer you data and voice for nine 95 a month and capture their 10 billion wifi connected devices on the planet more than there are people. If he got to fourth of that Earth, a fifth of that population, 2 billion, and he gets $10 a month from everybody, he's going to quickly have the money to launch people to Mars. So this is really a money problem and not a technology problem. If justice, we threw money at Apollo in the 60s, 4% of the GDP of the United States went into that program. Now about one 16th of the GDP of the United States goes into an asset. If you were to throw those kinds of resources into landing people on Mars, there would definitely be people on Mars within 10 years.

Speaker 3:          46:16          So Elon Musk, is he Cindy set that space x will land people on Mars in the next six years. What are your thoughts on that timeline as a sub question? What is, what do you think is a more realistic timeline for that to happen? Right.

Speaker 6:          46:30          I think they're the kind of different, when I originally wrote my book, I must owe me 20, 24, 2025. And I said, come on up. And he said, he said, look, if we haven't landed people on Mars by 2030, I will be the disappointed. And he met deeply disappointed, that kind of failure that he doesn't accept. Um, he recently walked back his statement on when the first humans would be on Mars. He recently said, I don't think many people notice this, but he's, he was asked in an interview, um, when the first people land on Mars, and he said the thing he's been saying recently, which is 2024 and then he said, well at least I'm certain we'll have a cargo missions by 2024. And that was a real walk back because he said, I'm not sure we'll have people on Mars in 2024 which is what he's been saying. So, but I'm sure we'll have a cargo mission. So give it a couple of years. Maybe the first cargo mission is 26. Next car

Speaker 8:          47:30          group mission is 2028 then 2030, you have a cargo mission and maybe it's simultaneously have you have two rockets going into it and you'll have a crew land that would, that would be the estimate that I would give you right now. There's a catch 22 in all of this. Um, and that's, it is the life on Mars. Question is it, there's going to be probably some new information about methane detection on Mars. That's going to be a very interesting possible connection for biology. Uh, the other thing is happening and there's a lot of concern about planetary protection and the coordination of, uh, uh, of international groups and Alon tossed his TESL out there. And that was not a happy moment for the planetary protection people. Um, although, you know, didn't get near and Mars or it's on some, you know, flew past it. But, uh, there's a problem and, uh, there's a real, I think there's going to be a headline battle between a planetary protection people and life detection people and privatization of Mars.

Speaker 8:          48:38          So I'd watch that one that's going to come and uh, we'll see. Um, I, I, but I, and the lawyer's thing is the greatest. It's a head on collision. It's just going to be wild. I mean, it's the wild west sort of thing, but, um, I think that's going to be another one. I, I've just finished writing up and I had to go talk to a lot of lawyers and a, they're there, you can have the Rolodex of, you know, pro con, no, we shouldn't do this and that. So we got some real issues coming.

Speaker 7:          49:10          I mean, I think the other issue that it is being addressed in two separate questions instead of one is this issue of where the outer space treaty was a peace treaty was the intention of it was a peace treaty and how significantly more advanced at this point weaponization of space and money when you're talking about money, the u s um, defense space budget. So the defense that the space budget of the defense industry, not NASA was $45 billion the last time it was identified and that was in 2015. So there's a lot of money there. And then where and how is the overlap being being discussed of as you move much more quickly towards Mars and the amount of money that's needed to do that and where the money currently resides, which is in the defense industry and weaponization, will there be a marriage that many people who have for a long time sought piece in space, uh, you know, have fought to, to prevent,

Speaker 8:          50:16          that's what we need to space for us anyway.

Speaker 7:          50:19          That's why we [inaudible] before you jump on that one second, I just add that, um,

Speaker 8:          50:26          you know, when you tried to

Speaker 1:          50:28          find a timeline for when will the first humans will be on Mars, it depends a great deal on what the strategy is for those humans. So it actually wouldn't be that hard to just send a couple of humans to Mars, have them be there for a few weeks, you know, Allah Apollo, and then have them come back. And we could certainly as a country if we chose to, we could do that in the 2020s, uh, but yeah,

Speaker 6:          50:54          but we would probably do an Apollo eight kind of thing and we go into orbit and come back and not actually land. Well, we could do both. Yep.

Speaker 1:          51:02          But in the series, but in the series, what we've chosen to do, if you notice it's many of the same astronauts from season one are still there in season two, Sammy, uh, as an example. And so if you're thinking about the first humans going to settle Mars, which is the way space x and Elan Musk talk about this, uh, there are many more cargo ships. There's much more of a base camp environment that needs to be built up, a lot more infrastructure. And so in my view, you're talking about the 2030s, by the time you would send those humans because of all the, uh, in placement of infrastructure that has to go first.

Speaker 6:          51:43          W One, one good thing was, you know, when I got the word to do this Mars book, I was at a conference at Johnson Space Center and they brought in all these, uh, scientist and for the first time in one room people sat around and talked about where do we, where do you land, where do we land, and where, where can this base fee? And then the exploration zones were being drawn out. I mean, it's been real discussion of moving ahead. There's a question back here,

Speaker 1:          52:13          so I apologize if feel fed up with this question. Um, were you influenced at all by Andy? Where's but the Martian in the series? And then vice versa. Do you think he was influenced by your work and what did you think of the science?

Speaker 6:          52:28          I have a personal story about that, which is, so in my book came out in 2015 in July of 2015 in April of 2015, um, I had been asked to do a Ted talk on bars and I did this talk, I've done two other ted talks on the main stage at Ted and they were both greeted by wild applause and people standing up and everything. And this one one was treated but polite applause. And I walked off the stage. What the hell happened here? Jeff Bezos had a dinner that night in which he basically tried to criticize every single thing I had said about people going to Maurice. And now this was a PR campaign by Elon Musk to gain more attention for Tesla and so forth. And the people that ran ted, who the guy who runs that is a close friend of mine, said, we're not putting your talk up online.

Speaker 6:          53:21          And then in September the Martian came out. So my book came out, wasn't selling the Martian came out. Um, I had sat down with Charlie bolden when I was writing the book and talked about NASA's plans for humans landing on Mars. And he took me to one of the 10,000 pages, obscure pages of NASA that said in big bold type NASA has no plans for human mission to Mars. Right there on the, on the website. Marchionne comes out. All of a sudden my book starts selling like crazy. Ted Decides to put my talk up online. Charlie bolden appoints a director of man mission to Mars. Didn't have any staff, but um, so that's how much influence a Hollywood movie had on society. It right. It actually convinced people that this was a possibility. If Matt Damon can do it, we can

Speaker 2:          54:19          nope.

Speaker 1:          54:21          Dance remix of Steven giving. Yeah.

Speaker 2:          54:27          And I'll also point out, yeah.

Speaker 1:          54:28          Did Andy, uh, participated as one of the big thinkers? Yes. In season one. So he was part of the first season of the nat geo a series.

Speaker 6:          54:38          And, and I should mention that he's gone through kind of a metamorphosis to, he was very defensive initially about the facts that were inaccurate in his book. Like, you know, 300 mile an hour wind on Mars is not going to drive a, a piece of an antenna through your space suit kind of thing. In fact, you could walk through a 300 mile an hour wind on Mars easily. It'd be like a three mile an hour wind on, on earth. And he was very defensive about that. And then he got involved in season one and you know, some of us were kind of beating up on him about that kind of stuff. And then season two came around and we beat up on him some more and now he's very open about what was wrong.

Speaker 1:          55:22          He's a great guy. He's a great guy. Yeah. All right. So, uh, I'm told that we're at a time, um, but I do, I want to thank you all for joining us here today. Uh, I'd, I'd highly encourage you to check out the series. A season two is continuing. You can check out episode five next Monday at 9:00 PM on the nat Geo Channel. Uh, and I want to also, uh, in addition to thanking our panelists, I want to thank Google for welcoming us.

Speaker 2:          55:51          Thank you very much.
