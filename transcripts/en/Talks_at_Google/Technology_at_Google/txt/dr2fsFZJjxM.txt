Speaker 1:          00:06          It is my great pleasure to introduce you guys to the USA for UN HCR. This is a group that has supported refugees through their partnerships with uh, you went high council on refugees and the partners of the UN High Council and refugees. They work diligently to provide support, food, shelter, water safety and protection to displace people. And to tell you a little bit more about the group and project hive, which by the way was one of fast company's 2017 most innovative companies. So we are in, we are in store for a treat today. Um, without any further ado, she only, she coulda, who is the major gifts manager for USA for you. And HCR.

Speaker 2:          01:00          Thank you so much for having us here today. We're really excited to be here, especially given Google's partnership, which we'll talk about in a moment. Um, but I just wanted to let you know, first off, of course we have a Hashtag, um, and that's Google talk refugees and you can find us on Twitter at UN refugee agency. So if you feel so inclined, please do give us a shout out online.

Speaker 2:          01:25          Um, so we're going to be talking about the global refugee crisis, um, to start out. And then I'm going to talk about the work of the UN refugee agency and USA for you and HCR. And this is going to be followed by a presentation of the hive, which is a special projects unit of USA for you and HCR and what they're doing to unlock a larger American audience to further the work that we do. Um, and then my colleague Nick is going to talk about Google's partnership and then we'll also have time at the end for questions. So just to start off, I don't know if you've heard the latest numbers, but over 67 million people have been displaced because a of, of violence, conflict and persecution, this is an unprecedented level of global displacement, the largest since World War II.

Speaker 3:          02:14          Yeah.

Speaker 2:          02:14          Um, and just to give you a sense of the scale of the crisis, 24 people around the world are displaced every minute, which means by the time we're done with this 45 minute presentation, about a thousand people would have been forced to leave home. Um, and of course, behind all of these numbers are countless stories of hardship, grief and loss, and just the struggle to rebuild lives.

Speaker 2:          02:39          So these 67 million refugees and internally displaced people mainly come from 15 active refugee emergencies. And here you can see that on the map. Um, I'm sure a lot of you have heard about the Syrian refugee crisis, so I'm not going to get too into it, especially given Google's, um, work on the searching for Stereo website, which if you haven't checked it out, I highly recommend it. Um, but there are 5 million refugees who have been forced to leave Syria and 6 million still displaced within the country. Um, but today I'm going to talk about two other refugee emergencies that aren't featured as prominently in the news. And the first one, it's South Sudan. So since December of 2013, civil war has claimed the lives of thousands of people. It's driven over 1.5 million refugees from, from the country and 1.9 within, um, in 2016, so last year, an average of 3000 people crossed South Sudan's borders in one day and 67% of these refugees are children. So a combination of ongoing conflict, violence and trout have deprived the farmers have the ability to grow and produce food. And this is creating a manmade famine, 100,000 people or an immediate danger of death by starvation and underserved neighboring countries like the DRC, Uganda and Ethiopia are hosting these refugees at an unsustainable rate. And this is creating Africa's largest scale refugee crisis.

Speaker 3:          04:17          Okay.

Speaker 2:          04:18          Um, another often overshadowed crisis is what's happening in the northern triangle of Central America right now. And those countries consist of El Salvador, Honduras, and Guatemala. And we're seeing a dramatic escalation in violence by organized criminal gangs. And as a result, the number of refugees have increased from 20 1020 12 to 146,020 16 and those numbers may not seem that large, but the fact that it's escalating so quickly is a growing cause of concern. We're seeing increases in disappearances forced recruitment into gangs, extortion, and sexual violence. And among these growing numbers of refugees are women and girls and unaccompanied and separated children, and they're particularly vulnerable to protection risks such as human trafficking and sexual assaults. So what does the UN refugee agency do? So UNH CR is the world's leading organization with a mandate by the UN to aid and protect those who have been forced to flee home. So there are about 11,000 UNHC our employees and 128 countries. Um, and 90% of them are in the fields and often remote and dangerous locations. And when an emergency strikes UNHC archi mobilize aid within 72 hours. And they've also helped over 50 million refugees successfully restart their lives since 1950.

Speaker 2:          05:56          So you're a quick chart of what

Speaker 3:          05:58          you and HCR does. So the agency provides life saving assistance like shelter, food, water safety, but it also provides critical resources that are necessary to rebuild lives. So cash assistance programs, education, job in skills training.

Speaker 2:          06:20          Um, USA for you in HCR is the UN refugee agencies, national partner in the U S so we work on raising awareness and funds to further UNHCRs work. So we provide help, hope and home. So help in the way of life saving assistance, hope in the form of job skills training and ultimately home, whether it's in their original country or in a different country like the u s

Speaker 2:          06:50          and this is just how UNHCRs finance. So if you take a look at this green segment right here, this is where USA for you and HCR comes in. So we're one of the two largest contributors of private sector funding and our donors give anywhere from $30 to $3 million to further the mission of the UN HCR. And given the refugee crisis that I just described and also the uncertainty of the rest of the pie, we're really focused on growing the segment even more. And Erin done from the hive is going to talk about one of the ways that we do just that.

Speaker 3:          07:26          Okay.

Speaker 4:          07:27          Thank you. Shyanne um, definitely having that background to understand the crisis is really important. Um, but today I'm going to talk a little bit more specifically about the United States and how we can really start to support the refugee crisis more. Um, so to start, I'm going to ask you guys all a question. What percent of the US public do you guys think donate to humanitarian causes?

Speaker 4:          07:54          60%. Anybody else? 20%. 2% 2%. Ooh, anybody else? Well, 2%. It was probably the closest. Um, and some of you guys might be surprised. Only 6% of, uh, of, of the American public donate team, Ma humanitarian causes. Um, even for somebody like me that's been working in this space for years was pretty shocked by that number. But when we started to look closer at the number we discovered, there's probably a reason for this. And a lot of it is because all the big NGOs like us and other ones like UNICEF and save the children, we're all competing after that same 6% because we know that those people are ripe and ready to take action. So we want it to look at how do we expand that 6% how do we go out to these people that aren't, aren't engaged at all in humanitarian causes and try to get them to activate. We knew it wasn't going to just be throwing more money at more advertising targeting that same percent. We needed real data science and innovation.

Speaker 3:          08:59          Hm.

Speaker 4:          09:00          So UNHCRs started asking these three main questions. Now you and HCR is pretty. Um, it's pretty good when it comes to marketing in Europe and other markets and they have a really strong support there. But as we all know, the United States is a totally different ballgame. So we had to approach it differently.

Speaker 4:          09:20          So in 2014, UNHC are and USA from Unh cr called the hive, which is a special project trying to unlock a larger audience here in the United States. We set up the hive here in New York and we hired some of the brightest and smartest people from different backgrounds, from politics or from the private sector. We wanted everybody that could look at this problem in a completely different way. And when we first started the hive, we did a lot of testing and yes, we failed a few times, but a lot of times we found out some pretty awesome stuff. Um, a few of which we'll go over a little bit later. Um, but the hive was really set up to have data as our backbone. Um, so we built a data model and we use that to infuse into a number of our campaigns so we could reach beyond that 6%.

Speaker 4:          10:13          Now our strategy has changed a little bit over time. When we first started, nobody was talking about the refugee crisis. So our goal was just to get people in the u s to start talking more. But in 2015, as you guys may know, things changed, the crisis hit Europe and a little boy washed up on a beach and suddenly everybody was talking about refugees. Things have shifted even more, as more terrorist attacks have hit Europe. And often that conversation sadly goes towards refugees. So instead of just getting people to talk about refugees, we're trying to change the conversation, we're trying to close that otherness gap and help Americans relate more to refugees because after all, they're just like us. So the hive is powered by data science, innovative technology, creative campaigns and strategic partnerships. Oh. And uh, this year we were recently featured as one of fast company's most innovative NGOs. And as I mentioned earlier, the backbone of this operation is really on data science. So I'm going to hand it off to my colleague Rita Co who heads up our data strategy.

Speaker 5:          11:24          Thank you Erin. Um, it's such a pleasure to be here today guys. Thank you for taking time out of your day. Uh, so data science, I feel like it's a new coin term that's been tossed around a lot as of late. Um, and it involves a lot of different professionals, whether that be someone in statistics, computer science, uh, someone like myself. That's why on the analyst side and taking the numbers. So what does that all mean? Um, and how did the hive take that and apply it to the refugee crisis? Uh, so Aaron Hussein, we built a data model. This model essentially allowed us to target about 250 million Americans out of the 320 million in the United States. And it gave us a more complete and kind of holistic understanding, uh, of an individual. And so now we were being, we were able to see beyond just the demographic variables of age, gender, income and so forth. But we were able to see more of their attitudes, their purchasing behaviors, and we were able to see, you know, whether they would have an affinity to engage in the global refugee crisis and support our efforts.

Speaker 5:          12:29          So what is predictive modeling? Um, I'm sure this concept is, is certainly not a new one for the folks in the room today. It's essentially the process of taking data and defining and creating predictions of throughout the behavior. In our case that the UN refugee agency, the desired behavior is obviously someone that's going to support our efforts in addressing the refugee crisis. Whether that be through donations, whether that be through awareness and advocacy. And so what we did was we took a that desired response and we created that as our target variable. We said we would like, you know, John Doe who lives in California to engage in the refugee crisis and everything about John Doe, whether that be his age, gender, income, a household where he lives, all that becomes the predictors. Um, and from the target variable and the predictors, we ran statistical algorithms to determine the association between the two. And then from that, we're able to see individually on a tour of the 250 million Americans how they were likely to engage if serve the right messaging on the right platform.

Speaker 3:          13:40          Okay.

Speaker 5:          13:40          So how did we build this predictive model? Uh, we ran two national surveys and I've persuasion online persuasion test, um, and these, uh, in the next few slides I'll go over how we build these predictive models. Um, essentially this allowed us to gauge those that are highly aware, highly supportive, and highly knowledgeable of the crisis in the United States.

Speaker 5:          14:05          So the national survey was around in July, 2015 and not surprisingly, over 70% had never heard of us. Um, which is, um, a result, which I'm sure maybe even yourselves have not heard of us until today. Um, but interestingly six and 10 of them supported our efforts and, and giving these life saving assistance services, uh, to refugees in those first forcibly displaced. So our brand was, was not very high. We also ran an online persuasion test. And, uh, from those messages, message frames, we were able to tell and Gardner where the support was in the United States for the UN refugee agency and our efforts. One message that garnered support on increasing economic aid, uh, was the message about over half of the refugees are children under the age of 17. And to give you a scale of the sense of that, if, as Sean was saying earlier, 65, so 67 million people exist today globally who have been forcibly displaced.

Speaker 5:          15:05          Now imagine 65 million, put that in half. That's around 32, 33 million. And that is essentially the population of Canada. So take Canada, make them all under the age of 17, and say that is the size of the population of children that are now forcibly displaced. So that is what moved Americans into a supporting economic aid, uh, for refugees, which is compelling message. Another message that had an effect on accepting more refugees was the fact that refugees shape, uh, America, including Albert Einstein. And so one of my, I guess favorite examples, I have a refugee that's made some huge differences in the world. So we ran this message test, we ran these surveys and we have all this survey data. How did we use this data to build the models while we first we took all the respondents and we upended the demographic information. Uh, so you can see on the table here, you know, we have or different scoring and we were able to append a lots of variables.

Speaker 5:          16:06          This is only gender Asian income. So it's not a true example of the sheer amount of data that we had available to us. And we essentially took all that data from the survey respondents and we narrow the variables using a statistical method called Lasso in order to determine which, which of those variables were the most predictive. After that we ran a logistic regressions and from there then we cross validated the model to make sure that it didn't, uh, over fit and at generalized across different samples. And then from there we were able to see those that were highly supportive, highly knowledgeable, the crisis, highly aware and those that had a willingness to be contacted. So from from there we were able then to pend a scores to each of the individuals on our file, which is about 250 million. Um, you'll see from this fictitious supporter here, uh, Joe, he will have had all of his demographic information, but in addition to that, the five scores, um, and so support obviously for the crisis, eight would a high score, obviously being a high probability, um, and then a look alike would be someone that looks like our current donor and is likely to make a donation and support our efforts.

Speaker 5:          17:19          So if you can imagine, then we have this, this model that it has a predictive score for each of these individual Americans. And now we're able to see on a micro level how to engage a different audiences in the United States. So we stacked these models on top of each other and we ended up with five a target populations. Uh, the, the first one being the lookalikes and that's 49 million individuals. So those are 49 million out of the 320 that likely I donate to that, to USA for your niche cr. And then we have who we call the persuadables and those are the core supporters, education and brand recognition. And those comprise about 14 million individuals. Now going back to what Erin was saying on the 6%, that is certainly growing that red segment. Uh, we are now approximately out a million supporters. So that's 14 times more than a, where we are now today.

Speaker 5:          18:17          So it provides us a good testing ground of microtargeting in a political Salway on these 14 million. And these are people that are new audiences, so they aren't, you know, if they are their prime to be engaged, but they are not yet I donating and supporting our efforts. And then of course not surprisingly 173 million over half of the United States population or are non targets. So you know, they don't look like our modeling. They're not likely to support our efforts. So after stacking these models, you can also see then on an individual level what it would look like across the United States. And we're able to then to see on a map geographically how to engage each of these supporters. Um, and so what we've essentially done with this predictive model is we've married that the products people buy, the brands they trust and their propensity and likelihood to engage in a social issue like the refugee crisis. And we're able then to do political style microtargeting married with our predictive modeling. So I'm going to hand it over back to Erin to discuss how we take this data on a micro level and aggregate, uh, into our campaigning. Oh, sorry. I'll take your question in the back,

Speaker 3:          19:27          the first slide with the individual straps, those are just examples of where those things you actually,

Speaker 5:          19:37          those are just examples where that would show would probably be, you know, if they've subscribed to like wellness health, um, uh, into that level unless, you know, we're able to receive the letter from bon appetit. We weren't able to come from that. So, um, thank you for the question.

Speaker 3:          19:53          Okay.

Speaker 5:          19:53          A hand it over. And Aaron,

Speaker 4:          19:56          thank you Rita. So I'm going to talk about how we take that. Um, can we take all that data and all that learnings that we absorbed and we turned it into campaigns to try to grow that 6%.

Speaker 4:          20:12          So, so far we've run 22 micro campaigns, all of these with a different audience and a different goal. Um, and all of our campaigns follow this same framework. Um, Rita kind of talked about the first part of it, which is modeling the data to find the right audience, to find the right people within that persuadable buckets. The next part, which is just as important, is finding the right context and messaging. And the right call to action. So as we all know, there's so many different Americans and we fall into so many different kinds of audiences that it really matters. It really mattered for us to find that right and call to action to get that conversion. So for example, to the campaigns I'm about to talk about, one is for an LGBT audience while one is for a more Christian conservative audience. So they both obviously had to have a little bit different messaging.

Speaker 3:          21:03          Okay.

Speaker 4:          21:03          The first one, which is one of my personal favorites is called rainbow refugees. Um, and we decided to do this campaign because we really saw an opportunity within the LGBT AI audience because they're already hyper political, very active, and they've accomplished quite a bit in the last 20 years. So we thought maybe this audience could also help us move the refugee conversation. And at the same time they're having to be a major LGBTA refugee crisis, which few people are talking about, especially in the media, um, because it doesn't fall into the Syria, um, storyline. Um, but right now there's 77 countries where it's illegal. Uh, world homosexuality is illegal. So there's men and women that are fleeing for their lives looking for safety just because of who they love. So we paired that messaging and that issue with the LGBT audience. And so far we've seen a huge uptick in engagement.

Speaker 4:          22:06          One of the tools that we often kind of tried to use was pop culture. Instead of trying to get people from all these different backgrounds to come talk to us about refugees, we tried to go where they were already having conversations online, whether it was the grammys or in this case, the world series. So two years ago during the world series, we took a look at some of our big numbers and some of the big numbers happening around baseball. And we quickly found something that was pretty unique. So the amount of people that flee on a daily basis at this time was 42,000 people, which is the same size or relatively close to the same size, is a lot of the baseball stadiums in the United States. So we took some of the, we took some of the teams that were still in the playoffs and we modeled up some of these social media memes. I'm trying to depict the idea of sitting in that stadium and thinking about that whole stadium, having to flee that day. And the really cool thing that we got out of this was that we were able to reach a younger male audience, which for any NGO is pretty incredible. Our typical donor, like many NGOs is older women. So to be able to reach that audience was pretty exciting for us.

Speaker 3:          23:22          Okay.

Speaker 4:          23:22          Another tool that we often tested and tried with some of our campaigns was doing unbranded. Many studies show that Americans are more likely to support a cause rather than a brand x, especially if that brand has the UN in it. So one of the campaigns that we ran that was unbranded was called under his wings. We built a community targeting Christian conservatives, Catholics and tried to use messaging that was more relatable to them. Um, we also tried to use the opportunity, the pope coming to town, uh, as another opportunity to reach out to this audience. So we ran a campaign, uh, which was, Jesus was a refugee, uh, which was free bumper stickers. And we ran this full page ad over here in the, in USA today when the pope came to visit. Um, and we got, we had a lot of interest in, a lot of people signed up for the free stickers, even some people that didn't quite fall into that audience. But we're excited for a bumper sticker

Speaker 4:          24:19          beyond just campaigns. We also have been building some digital tools and different products the first time, first test into the product world. We dead refugee emojis. Um, so this is the keyboard that we built with a partner and so far we, so far it's been able to help us kind of have a new way of engaging a younger millennial audience. Um, and it's also been helping us with some of our data science currently. There's a lot of studies going into sentiment and, and being able to kind of look at social media and get sentiment scores based on emojis. So this has been helpful as we kind of look further into that.

Speaker 4:          24:58          And last but not least, we are working currently on launching a new product. I'm using Facebook Messenger's new BOT technology. We're working with a special partner to slowly a scale up, a new product that would allow users to have a more intimate and meaningful engagement with a refugee like character. Um, so this will allow people to kind of have a one on one experience with a refugee and in a way walk a mile in their shoes. Um, so we are launching our Beta version, uh, next week, uh, with World Refugee Day. If you guys didn't know World Refugee Day is June 20th, so if you go onto our Facebook next week and you chat up our chat messenger, um, you can go through the experience. Um, but just to warn you that it's very, uh, it's just our Beta, so we are still testing. Um, and you can definitely expect more if you watch this space. So with that, I'm going to turn it over to my colleague Nick, who oversees our corporate partnerships and he's going to talk about the amazing support of Google and how you guys can get involved more.

Speaker 6:          26:08          Alright, thanks Erin. And thanks to everybody who's a, again taking time out of your busy work day. And, um, I know we've had an opportunity to talk a little bit about, uh, the great needs that UNHCRs facing the work that unit chairs undertaking. Obviously the unique and innovative work of the hive. But I really wanted to talk about the great work that Google is doing and has been doing since we began partnering with Google in 2015. So just for some context, um, since 2015, Google as an institution has provided over three point $8 million in critical funding, uh, for UNHCRS programs. Um, in some cases specifically focused on the Syria response in the surrounding region, countries such as Jordan and Lebanon. And even more importantly, a Google is contributed some loosely earmarked funds for UNHCRs general emergency response. I knew that Syria is often been driving a lot of our talking points, but there's a global refugee crisis that continues to unfold and as we again have highlighted, the needs are tremendous.

Speaker 6:          27:08          So, uh, Google support has been truly remarkable. One of the interesting things about our partnership with Google, it's not certainly at all limited to fundraising and it's actually a really dynamic, multifaceted and global partnership. And certainly as a corporate partnerships person, um, we always an often look beyond just the cash resources of companies that we engage with, but to look to their expertise, to look to the capacity to really, um, you know, advance amplify our work. I think one really great example is the searching for Syria. A micro site that I know has been mentioned in many ways, we're trying to reengage the u s public in a very different manner. And the searching for serious site has allowed us to humanize, to sh show exactly what life is like for people living in these really difficult conditions. Um, certainly the mirroring of Syria before and after the war is, it's really remarkable.

Speaker 6:          28:00          It's really relatable to Americans because in many ways, a serious life before the war looked similar in some respects to those in, in the United States. So, um, again, a big thank you for Google's collaboration on that. And I wanted to talk a little bit about Google's most recent employee engagement program and say a big huge thank you to everybody in the room. Um, even if you haven't participated, um, you're a valuable employee voice on behalf of refugees. Um, today that campaign raised $440,000 for USA for you and HCR and I've included just some bullets on what that is equivalent to an UNHCRs, a programmatic universe. I'm, one of the things that really sticks out to me as somebody who's been working around the UN refugee agency for awhile is that your support is equivalent to nearly 10,000 Syrian refugee children gaining access to education. Um, again, back to the Syria narrative.

Speaker 6:          28:57          I know if you saw on the news, um, but there's often a lost generation that's referred to, um, with kids being out of school in some cases up to five, six, seven years. So for children to gain access back to education, to regain normalcy, to um, be able to continue their education like any other child should be able to, um, is hugely important. And we'll have a long term transformative effect on those children's lives. So I really wanted to call that one out in particular and beyond just the thank you, um, which I think if anything else you take away from my portion of the conversation is, again, thank you. Um, is just some additional ways that you as Google employees can continue to help. Um, no, we've talked about searching for Syria. If you haven't already done so, please do share with any of your friends, colleagues, um, because they can become valuable allies overall for UNHCRs work in the US.

Speaker 6:          29:46          Um, continue to please to commit to a workplace giving. I know that there's a variety of institutions that, um, you can choose to support and we've been fortunate enough to be chosen by Google employees at, it's such a wonderful level and it will be talked about and Aaron's presentation World Refugee Day is next week. Come June 20th. Please follow us on social media. Uh, please amplify our messaging. It's really awesome to have, um, again, an audience with you guys in touch. Good timing. So we can't highlight that. Um, please visit our website and there is a URL URL here. Excuse me. They can direct you to some additional ideas of how you could even involve your communities and a fundraising awareness activities. And again, lastly, please continue to follow us on social media. And with that I'll just skip over to the last line and open it up for questions.

Speaker 7:          30:35          Please use the microphone. You have to have a 20% projects that Googlers good, participated. I'm sorry I couldn't hear that very well. So, uh, at Google we have the possibility of spending some of our time either volunteer or as it's called 20% time. Do you have any projects we can help with?

Speaker 4:          31:02          Yup. Um, so Rita and I, uh, we can definitely take that because the hive is always interested in working, um, especially with people in the technology sector. Um, so definitely I can give you our cards afterwards. Um, we'd love to hear kind of what your background is. We kind of have our, our wishlist of things that we'd like to do and want to do. Um, so usually we can kind of take, um, what your background is and try to mirror it with one of those projects. But yes, thank you. We would be extremely happy for that.

Speaker 7:          31:31          Yeah. And um, we also have, um, internal website where people can, uh, different nonprofits can put a bunch of volunteer opportunities and a, you can write down a set of skills and all the rest and then after that, yeah, all the company will have access to it. So.

Speaker 5:          31:47          Great. And if I could just add to Erin's comment, we are constantly looking for data scientists that or those that you don't call yourself a data scientist so you could have the skills or data scientists that I can look at our data sets and assist us. Um, I'm just going to hand the mic over to Kevin.

Speaker 7:          32:03          I'm just going to say there is no official, a 20% engagement in place right now, but that doesn't mean that you can't engage sort of outside of the typical Google engagement model. Sure. But I do know we have a volunteer site, which is, which is not specifically 20%, but like exactly. Yup. Got It. Cool. Thank you. Um, yeah. When you did your analysis, um, was there anything that jumped out at you that was something you didn't expect, um, when you were kind of looking at demographics?

Speaker 5:          32:38          Yeah, that's a great. Um,

Speaker 3:          32:40          I think, you know, to pinpoint one, one finding i's hard and in that, um, sometimes actually the most obvious finding is very illuminating because we assume, as Erin was describing earlier with a lot of the, uh, individuals that engage in social classes and donate in the United States are, are women liberal leaning, um, well specifically to our cause I given the refugee crisis and where it stands politically. Um, so with that said, it's even illuminating to see that who we think are our look alike are indeed who sign up and engage on these micro tests. Um, so in that is a validation in itself. Um, you know, sometimes we'll have moments where I will run a test and we'll be like, well, that's Kinda interesting, weird outlier. But, um, at this moment in time, I can't think of a specific, but I would, um, there's certainly nothing that at this moment we're able to scale and apply to the larger United States population.

Speaker 7:          33:43          So you mentioned that about 6% of Americans donee devotee statistics of how successfully hive has been able to like expand that donor pool or how effective the target of a campaigning has been.

Speaker 3:          33:56          Okay.

Speaker 4:          33:57          Um, I would kind of say it that we, we just kinda started to lay this groundwork to really scale it up. Um, so I don't think we have any numbers specifically around that 6%. Um, definitely there's been an uptick in donations, especially to refugee organizations recently, um, with certain things that have been happening in the news. Um, so that has been in a way helpful. Um, but we are really trying to kind of, um, you know, a lot of what we did in the beginning was a lot of that testing. Um, so because there was like 22 micro campaigns, now we kind of have an idea of where to go next. Um, we're obviously not going to run 22 more. Uh, we might just do one to three that are much bigger and scale them. Um, but I also think regard laying this groundwork, um, with the backbone of data science that can also be applied to other organizations. Um, so we are also talking with other NGOs, um, and trying to kind of, um, make it a more, a more cultural shifts similar in the way that the Obama campaign really forced political campaigns to make a total shift.

Speaker 7:          35:03          Great question. Um, one more about the refugee bought. Why, why did you decide to do that? When there's like what seems like a surplus of actual refugees that could kind of be in these chat sessions you're trying to promote?

Speaker 4:          35:19          Sure. Um, so there are kind of, uh, there's two things that are kind of happening. We do have UNHC our global, which is in Geneva and they have an innovation team whose mandate is more, um, working directly on products that support and help refugees. Um, I can't speak to it too much, but I do know that there some things in the works to kind of build a Facebook, a similar Facebook Bot that is more actually helping directly refugees. So if they have a question, um, using AI will be able to provide automated responses. Um, but for our, our mandate is to really engage, um, Americans to kind of grow support. Um, so we are, we're still in the testing phases of exactly what we think that we can use. Uh, Facebook chatbots for, um, and, and so I think we're you asking why we're not using actual refugees?

Speaker 5:          36:09          Yeah. Like instead of having an AI, why not just connect people in actual refugees?

Speaker 4:          36:15          A lot of that, a lot of that does go back to safety. Um, a lot of times we can't use real names. We can't give locations. Um, because a lot of times these people, um, are targeted continuously even after they flee. Um, so we have a lot of LGBT refugees whose families even are out to get them. So we can't, a lot of times they're reluctant to put their names out there. On a large scale, um, in public. Um, but we do, we do use a lot of their stories and a lot of their stuff to kind of create those, um, to create the personas.

Speaker 6:          36:51          Sorry, just a quick corollary to that because I think it speaks to a larger issue that you're perhaps raising is you ACR very much does engage directly with refugees and some cases are small level pilot level, I'd say. Um, entrepreneurship, a coding opportunities that are happening in different locations through the world beyond just sort of the refugee response in bots. There's a lot of other interesting programs. Um, but yeah, she, she just knew it offline and I can follow up more if this sounded interesting. Um, so the slightly similar but

Speaker 3:          37:20          response,

Speaker 5:          37:22          um, you guys showed the sentences that kind of calls people to donate more unless I was just wondering if there's a theme among those like killed inspiration, like tying it to something they may be able to relate to, like what that looked like. Um, I should preface that that survey was conducted on in July, 2015 and so those message frames obviously have changed dramatically since the 2016 election. Um, and we did recently random message test. Um, and we are still in the process of analyzing those results, but certainly moral and compassion is, is a theme that resonates with Americans and changing behavior and increasing support. And I'll just hand it over to Erin and she took a key role in that, in that pilot.

Speaker 3:          38:02          Yeah.

Speaker 4:          38:02          Yeah. Um, as she said, we're still kind of analyzing and going through all that data, but we did more recently, a couple months ago, run a new message test and I think Rita already kind of hit the nail on the head that it is moral compassion. I'm calling on Americans and saying, America, we're compassionate. We're giving, let's not turn our backs. Um, so that kind of messaging we really saw, um, dead a little bit better.

Speaker 3:          38:31          Any other questions? Okay. Well, thank you so much. Uh, everyone. Um,

Speaker 4:          38:39          yes, thank you. Um, and obviously if you guys have any other followup questions, if you're interested in anything specific that we talked about, feel free to follow up. We brought cards. Um, we also brought stickers that say with refugees. Um, so if you guys want to take some, you can take multiple given to your friends, take photos of them, put them on social media Hashtag with refugees. Um, and as nick mentioned, World Refugee Day is, uh, June 20th, so definitely, um, go online, sign our petition to stand with refugees and uh, tell the world

Speaker 3:          39:13          thank you.

Speaker 1:          39:14          Oh, and back to Kevin or a wonderful hubs. I was just going to say on the behalf of everyone here and the employees of the New York City office, thank you guys for coming. Thank you for sharing your story. Um, these guys will be here for a little bit longer. Um,

Speaker 3:          39:29          that's it. Thanks.
