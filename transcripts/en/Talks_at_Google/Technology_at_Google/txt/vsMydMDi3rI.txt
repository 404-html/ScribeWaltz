Speaker 1:          00:00:06       [inaudible]

Speaker 2:          00:00:13       good morning. It's a pleasure to be here this morning. I've got to ask your indulgence on two things. It's allergy season. So I have a real hard time during this time of the year speaking and to, uh, most of the speaking I do when I walk up to the podium is very technical. It deals with cyber crime and identity theft, forgery, embezzlement and things of that nature. I don't often talk about my life, but Google has asked me today, do something that different and talk a little bit about my life. So I will do that. And then at the end of course I'll take questions and those questions can be about any subject matter that you like to ask. As you know, I've had a lot of people tell my story. I had a great movie director write a film about my life. I had a great Broadway musical team, make a Tony Award winning Broadway musical about my life, had a popular television show on TV, white collar for four years curtain around my life.

Speaker 2:          00:01:02       And most of those very creative people have actually never met me personally, but they've enjoyed telling my story from their point of view. So I thought it would take a few minutes this morning and actually tell you the story from my point of view. I was raised just north of New York City in Westchester County, New York. I was actually one of four children in the family, the so called middle child or the form. I was educated there by the Christian brothers of Ireland in a private Catholic school called Iona where I went to school from kindergarten to high school. By the time I had reached the age of 16 in the 10th grade, my parents after 22 years of marriage one day decided to get a divorce. Unlike most divorces where the children were usually the first to know. My parents were very good about keeping that a secret. I remember being in the 10th grade when the father walked in the classroom one afternoon, asked the brother to excuse me from class.

Speaker 2:          00:01:52       When I came out in the hallway, the father handed me my books and told me that one of the brothers would drive me to the county seat in white plains, New York, where I would meet my parents and they would explain what was going on. I remembered the brother dropped me at the steps of a big stone building and told me to go on up the steps in my parents would be waiting for me in the lobby. I remember climbing the steps, seeing a sign on the building that said family court, but I really didn't understand what that meant. When I arrived in the lobby, my parents were not there, but I was ushered into the back of an immense courtroom where my parents were standing before a judge. I couldn't hear what the judge was saying nor my parents' response, but eventually the judge saw me at the back of the room and motioned me to approach the bench, so I walked up to stand in between my parents.

Speaker 2:          00:02:35       I remember distinctly that the judge never looked at me. He never acknowledged I was standing there. He simply read from his papers and said that my parents were getting a divorce and because I was 16 years of age, I would need to tell the court which parent I chose to live with. I started to cry, so I turned and ran out of the courtroom, Judge Call for a 10 minute recess, but by the time my parents got outside, I was gone. My mother never saw me again for about seven years until I was a young adult. Contrary to the movie, my father never saw me wherever it spoke to me again in the mid 1960s running away, it was very popular thing for young people. A lot of them got caught up in Haight Ashbury, the hippie scene, that drug scene instead, I took a few, belongs in my home, packed them in a bag or did what was in the new haven and Hartford railroad for the short train ride down to grand central terminal in New York.

Speaker 2:          00:03:25       My father did own the stationery store in Manhattan. It was located on the corner of 40th and Madison. Like all of us. We had to work in that store. So from the time I was about 13 I made deliveries from my dad in the summer on a bike. I knew the city very well. So naturally I started looking for the same type of work. There were a lot of signs on the windows stock boy delivery boy part time. I'd walk in and apply. So tell me young man, how old are you? 16 how far did you go in high school? 10th Grade, I'll hire you. And I went to work for a small amount of money, a few hours a day. But as soon realized I couldn't support myself on that amount of money. I also realized as long as people believed I was 16 years old, they weren't going to pay me any more money.

Speaker 2:          00:04:10       At 16 I was six foot tall. I've always had a little gray hair. My friends in school used to say that once a week when we dressed in a suit for mass, I look more like a teacher. So I decided to lie about my age in New York. We had a driver's license at 16 back then. It didn't have a photo on it, just an IBM card. So I altered one digit and my date of birth, I was actually born in April of 1948 but I dropped the four, converted it to a three and that made me 26 years old. I walked around applying for the same type of work. People gave me a little more money, few more hours, but even then it was very difficult to make ends meet. One of the few things I had taken when I left home was a checkbook.

Speaker 2:          00:04:49       I had money from work on the summers. I had some money in that checking account. So every so often I would write a check to supplement my income. $20 $25 the funds were there, the checks were good, but it was my friends, my peers who would constantly say to me, you know, you're the only guy. No walks into a bank in the middle of Manhattan. You have no account there you don't know is so you talked to somebody behind a desk and they okay or check, oh my checks are good. You have it. If I walked in there, they wouldn't touch my cheque. You walk in there, they don't bat an eye. I, years later reporters would write and speculate and say that that was my upbringing, mannerisms, dress, appearance, speech, whatever it was. It was very easy to do. So consequently, when the money right now, I kept writing those checks.

Speaker 2:          00:05:34       Of course, the checks started to balance. Please started looking for me as a runaway, so I thought maybe it was a good time to start thinking about leaving New York City, but I was quite apprehensive about going to Chicago or Miami, one that if they cash in New York, check on a New York driver's license in Miami as quickly as they did in Manhattan. I was walking at 42nd street when afternoon, about five o'clock in the evening, 16 years old, pondering all of these things. When I started to approach the front door of an old hotel that used to be, they're called the Commodore Hotel now the Grand Hyatt, just as I was about to get to the front door of the hotel out stepped in eastern airline flight crew onto the sidewalk. I couldn't help but notice the captain and the copilot, the flight engineer, about three or four flight attendants dragging their bags to the curb to load them in the van to take them to the airport as they loaded the van.

Speaker 2:          00:06:23       I thought to myself, that's it. I could pose as a pilot, I could travel all over the world for free. I probably could get just about anybody anywhere to cash a check for me. So I walked up the street a little further to 42nd and park. I went to cross over, I heard a huge helicopter. So I looked up and there was New York Airways landing on the roof for the Pan Am building Pan Am the nation's flag carrier. The airline that flew around the world. I thought, what a perfect airline to use. So the next day I placed a phone call to the executive corporate offices, a pan n. I remember distinctly when the phone was ringing, I had absolutely no idea what I was going to say when they answered Panamerican Airlines. Good morning. Going to help you now. Yes ma'am. I'd like to. Um, I'd like to speak to somebody in the purchasing department purchasing one moment and the clerk came on and see us and maybe can help me.

Speaker 2:          00:07:15       My name is, uh, John Black. I'm a copilot with the company based out of San Francisco. Been with the company about seven years, but never had anything like this come up before. But what's the problem? Well, we flew at chip in here yesterday. We're going out later today. I, yesterday I sent in my uniform out through the hotel to have it dry clean. Now the hotel and the cleaners said they can't find it. Yeah, I'm with a flight and about four hours, new uniform. And you have a spare uniform? Certainly back home in San Francisco, but I never get it here at the time from my flight. I do understand this will cost you the price of uniform, not the company, but I understand. Hold on, I'll be right back. He came back and said, my supervisor says you need to go down to the well bill uniform company on Fifth Avenue.

Speaker 2:          00:07:58       There are supplier, I'll call them and let them know you're on your way. Well, that's exactly what I wanted to know. So I went down to the well bill uniform company, Little Fella, Mr Rosen, me out in the uniform, that black Gabardine three gold stripes on the arm. I certainly looked old enough to be the pilot when he was all done. I said, how much do owe you but the uniforms? $286 said, no problem. I'll write you a check. No, we can't take any checks. Oh well then I'll um, I'll just pay you cash and we can't accept cash. You need to fill out this computer card. Then it needs boxes. Put your employee number. Then we build this back on the uniform allowance comes out of the annex pain and paycheck, but that's even better. Go ahead and do that. New York had two airports, Laguardia and Kennedy.

Speaker 2:          00:08:43       Laguardia was 20 minutes from Manhattan. Kennedy was 50 naturally Laguardia being the closer of the two. That's where I went. I spent most of the morning walking around Laguardia in the uniform, trying to figure out, now that I had this uniform, how the hell do you get on these planes? I got a little hungry. So about lunch time I walked into the luncheonette and the terminal sat down with the counter on the stool in order to sandwich moments Seder, a twa crew walked in, the flight attendant sat in the booth, but the pilots up at the counter on either side of me and captain right next to me. Now back before deregulation of the airlines, airline people thought of themselves as just one big family. So they didn't hesitate a moment to talk to each other. And the captain kind of leaned over. A young man as Pan Am doing, doing just fine. Captain, tell me what's Pan Am doing out here to Laguardia. Panim doesn't fly into Laguardia. They only fly into Kennedy. Well, I picked up on that right away.

Speaker 2:          00:09:37       Yeah, we came into, Kennedy had a layover, so I came over to visit some friends. Matter of fact, I'm on my way back to Kennedy now. So tell me, man, what type of equipment or your arm or airline people have a lot of jargon for things and one of them is they never call a Planar planar and aircraft. They call it equipment. And what type of equipment you're I'm in. What type of plane do you fly back then? The DCA at seven oh seven of course I didn't know that. And I thought type of equipment, equipment. Amman is this stool, they must mean what type of equipment is on the planes. I've fly. So I thought, well, they've got the wings, they've got the engine. It always had a sticker on the engine who manufactured the engines. So I said, yeah, it's General Electric. All three pilots kind of just stopped eating and leaned over and he, Kevin said a really, what do you fly washing machines?

Speaker 2:          00:10:20       So I knew I said the wrong thing out the door. I went, everybody had an airline ID card, a plastic laminated card, much like a driver's license today. Yet without the ID card, the uniform was worthless. I went back to Manhattan, pretty discouraged thinking, where would I come up with a Pan American airline corporate ID. I was sitting in the hotel room. I noticed a big thick Manhattan yellow pages. So I pulled them down on the bed, flipped them open and looked under the word identification. There were three or four pages of companies who made convention badges, metal badges, plastic badges, police badge. It's fire badges. Started to call around and finally when companies said, listen, most of those airline ids manufactured by Polaroid, three M company B to call one of them finally got the three m company on the phone in Manhattan. You know, we manufacture paintings identification system along with a number of other carriers.

Speaker 2:          00:11:11       How come? So tell you, I'm a purchasing officer for a major US carrier. I'm in New York just for the day, or we're getting ready to expand our routes. Are a lot of new employees go to a formal id. We're very impressed with this Pam format when that, if I came by our office this afternoon briefly, we could discuss quantity and price by all means come on by. So I went by a dressed in a suit and the sales were up. Opened the book. Yeah, we do United Braniff national Pan Am Pan Am we'd like this Pan Am format when if you have a sample I could bring back. Sure, I'll be right back. And he brought me back a five by seven glossy piece of paper with a picture of an ID card blown up in the middle of it. Someone else's picture in the picture. John Doe for a name and in boulder I think across the front. This is a sample only. I said, no, I'm afraid this one to you and I need to bring back an actual physical card. And by the way, what is all this equipment on the floor? And we don't just sell these cards. We sell the system camera laminator. I, oh, we have to buy all this. Absolutely. But tell you what, since we have to buy it all, why don't we just demonstrate how it works and use me fine. I have a say right here. Take my picture.

Speaker 2:          00:12:17       I was going down the elevator studying the card. It had a blue board or across the top that a half inch in Pan Am's colored blue but not a single thing on the card. Said Pan-am, no logo, no insignia, no company name. This is a plastic card, like a credit card. So you couldn't type on it, couldn't ride on it, couldn't print on it, discouraged to put it in my pocket. Headed back to the hotel and there was walking back, I noticed that I had passed the hobby shop so I turned around and walked back. Excuse me sir. I've seen, so a lot of models here. If some models of commercial jetliners sure. Over there. And I bought a model of a Pan Am seven oh seven cargo jet, took it back to my room, open the box through all the parts out, but they're at the bottom of the box was a sheet of decals, one on the model and when soaked in a glass of water, the Little Pan and blue globe that we're doing on the tail of the plastic plane when perfect up at the top of the plastic card and the word Pan Am and there's special styling of graphics, it would've went on the future.

Speaker 2:          00:13:09       Lodgement perfect across the top of the card and it clear decal on the laminated plastic made a beautiful identification card. Pay An amp says they estimate that between the ages of 16 and 18 I flew more than a million miles for free board and more than 260 commercial aircraft and more than 26 countries around the world. Pan Am's is, keep in mind the fact that frank having Neil didn't impact poses one of our pilots for a long period of time. He never once stepped on board one of our aircraft. That's true. I never flew on Pan Am because I was afraid. Someone might say to me, you know, I'm based in San Francisco, been out there 16 years. I don't recall ever meeting you before. Or someone might say, you know your ID card, it's not exactly like my id card. So instead I flew on everyone else. If I wanted to go somewhere, I literally just walked out to the airport, walked up on the board, United flight 800 to Chicago.

Speaker 2:          00:14:03       Then I went downstairs to the door marked United operations in, walked in the operations clerk, hey Pam, can we do for you if you want to have to jump seats open on 800 needed it in Chicago, opened this evening like get a pink slip pass. I'd give him my id, right Matt, a pass. I'd walk out, hand it to the flight attendant. She'd opened the door to the cockpit and I'd step in and a captain, a copilot of flight engineering to seat behind the captain called the jumpseat where pilots deadhead on company time because pilots love to talk shop. Once you picked up that jargon, it was the same conversation over and over and over. So I just step our mod. Even Gen Bob Davis be run in Chicago on the taxi out. Oh is the same questions about how long you've been with Pan Am been flying about seven years or position.

Speaker 2:          00:14:46       You fly right seat, which is airline terminology for copilot. What of equipment we on had that one down. Perfect. Matter of fact, whatever they flew, I didn't fly so no problems with that and we'd arrive in Chicago. I'd go by the Pan Am ticket counter, but just enough to get the attention of the passenger service Rep. Excuse me, I haven't laid over here and over a year it was still at the apartment house opened downtown, catch crew bus, low level door, three out. I go down the Palmer House, Hilton Walk in and on the corner of the registration desk was a little sign said airline cruise. That was a three ring binder you signed in, referenced your flight number, showed your Id. They'd give me a key, I'd stay two or three days in pain and would be direct billed from my room and my meals. I also could cash a personal check at the front desk because I was an employee of the airline.

Speaker 2:          00:15:31       The airline had a contract with the hotel and as a courtesy that cash your check. But then I found out that every airline honors every other airline employees, personal check, actually a reciprocal agreements still practice today in 2017 so at the San Francisco airport at Delta flight attending can walk up to an American airline ticket counter show her ID and Cassia personal checkup to $100 and vice versa. Of course, when I found that out, I'd go out to JFK or lax or me, I'd go to everybody in northeast and national KLM air gram. It would take me a good eight hours stopping at every counter and every building. By the time I got all the way around the other end of the airport, at least eight hours have gone by. And what did you have an eight hours shift change new people. So I go all the way back around the other way.

Speaker 2:          00:16:15       As you know, I went on to impersonate a doctrine, the Georgia hospital for a while. I took the bar exams in Louisiana, passed the bar, went to work for attorney general pf Grameen on the Civil Division of the State Court where I spent about a year of practicing law in both the job as the lawyer and the doctor. No one ever doubted for a second. I was not eligible or qualified to do so. I on my own, resigned and moved on. Of course, like any criminal, sooner or later you get caught and I was no exception to that rule. I was actually arrested just once in my life when I was 21 years old by the French police in a small town in southern France called Mum Pa. The French police were actually arresting me on an Interpol warrant issued by the Swedish police who are looking for me for forgery and Sweden, but believed that I was living in France when the French authorities took me into custody on that warrant.

Speaker 2:          00:17:03       They realized I had forged checks all over France. So they refused to honor the warrant and Sweden's requests from my extradition. They later convicted me at forgery and sent me to French prison. I served my time and a place called the maids on Dra, the house of arrest in a small town, southern France called Pepin young Steven Spielberg, tow Barbara Walters. It was extremely important to me to go back to that sell to the exact cell he was in and reconstruct it according to the log books during his stay there, he said, to my amazement, that was a blanket on the floor. No mattress, a hole in the floor to go to the bathroom, no plumbing, no electricity. Instead, according to the log books, I entered the prison at 198 pounds, left the prison at 109 pounds. When sentence was over in France, I was extradited to Sweden where I was later convicted of forgery in a Swedish court of law and essentially the Swedish penitentiary in Malmo, Sweden.

Speaker 2:          00:17:59       When my prison term was up in Sweden, US federal authorities took custody of man, returned me to the United States, eventually ignited states federal judge in Atlanta, Georgia would sentence me to 12 years in federal prison. I served four of the 12 years at a federal prison in Petersburg, Virginia. When I was 26 years old, the government offered to take me out of prison on the condition I go to work with an agency of the federal government for the remainder of my sentence or until my parole had been satisfactorily completed. I agreed and was released this year. I'm celebrating 41 years at the FBI. I've been at the bureau for more than four decades. I work out of Washington DC. I actually make my home in Charleston, South Carolina, so every Monday I fly up to Washington about an hour of flight and I go home on Thursday evenings. I live in Charleston with my one and only wife of 40 plus years, and my three sons, my youngest boy graduated from the University of Beijing in China.

Speaker 2:          00:18:57       He went on to get his master's degree there. He reads, writes and speaks Chinese fluently. He works for a San Francisco Gaming Company called Glu Mobile. He designs gaming, uh, games for the Chinese market. All of his games are in Chinese and they're in their fourth generation as mobile games and devices. My middle son graduated from University of Nevada and Las Vegas. His degree was in business. He and his wife graduated together and he and her own a business in South Carolina and they manage that business together. My oldest son graduated from University of Kansas at k. You, he went on to Loyola School of law in Chicago to get his law degree, passed the bar in Illinois and went on to make his dad very, very proud. He's an FBI agent. He's been in the bureau about 12 years. He supervises a team that deals with American citizens, kidnapped overseas. So their response team that operates out of Quantico, Virginia.

Speaker 2:          00:19:46       As many of you know, I had very little to do with the film. Um, I would have preferred not to had a movie made about my life. I actually raise my three boys in Tulsa, Oklahoma in the same house for 25 years. My neighbors had no idea who I was and I would have preferred it stayed that way. But Steven Spielberg told Barbara Walters, he felt compelled to tell the world the story, not because of what I did, but because of what I'd done with my life. After that, he loved the redemption side of the story. We wanted the world to know the story. So in the end, my family and I were very pleased with the outcome of the film, but we thought in a couple of years I would all be forgotten and move on with our life. I never dreamed that. Catch me, if you can, we go on to earn more than a billion dollars for dreamworks and be shown over and over literally every week on Hbo and TV and then become a Broadway musical and a TV show.

Speaker 2:          00:20:39       So consequently, every Monday morning when I come to work, I have emails. They come from all over the world. Someone who's seeing the movie for first time watching the play at a community theater or a high school somewhere and they feel compelled to write, and of course they come from people literally as young as eight years old, sending those emails to people as old as 80 most people assume I'll never read those emails or see those emails, but they feel compelled to write and they want to make a statement. Some say, you know, you are brilliant. You are an absolute genius. I was neither. I was just a child, had been brilliant. Had it been a genius, I don't know that I would've found it necessary to break the law in order to just simply survive. And while I know that people are fascinated by what I did some 50 years ago as a teenage boy, I've always looked upon what I did is something that was immoral, illegal, unethical, and a burden I live with literally every single day of my life and will until my death.

Speaker 2:          00:21:40       There are many who write and say, well, you know, you were certainly gifted that it was. I was one of those few children and I got to go up in the world with the Daddy. Now the world is, the world is full of fathers, but there are very few men worthy of being called daddy by their child. I had a daddy loved his children more than you love life itself. Steven Spielberg, tow Barbara Walters and mirror research frank shoes. Now, without having met frank, I couldn't help but put his father in the film through the likes of Christopher Walken. My father was a man who had four children, three boys and a daughter. Every night at bedtime, he'd walk into your room. He was six three he would drop down on one knee, kiss you on the cheek, pull the cover up, and he put his lip up on your ear lobe and it whisper deep interior, I love you.

Speaker 2:          00:22:32       I love you very much. He never ever missed a night. As I grew older, I sometimes fell asleep before he got home, but always woke up the next morning, knew he had been back at my bedside. Years later, my older brother joined me in my room temporarily. He was in the Marine Corps. He was six [inaudible] four he played semipro football for Buffalo, but my father would walk around to his bed, hug him, kiss him, whispering in his area. He loved them. When I was 16 years old, I was just a child. All 16 year olds are just children, much as we'd like them to be adults, they're just children and like all children, they need their mother and they need their father. All children need their mother and their father. All children are entitled to their mother and their father and though it is not popular to say so divorce is a very devastating thing for a child to deal with and then have to deal with the rest of their natural life.

Speaker 2:          00:23:34       For me, a complete stranger, a judge told me I had to choose one parent over the other. That was a choice of 16 year old boy could not make. So I rang. How could I tell you my life was glamorous. I cried myself to sleep till I was 19 years old. I spent every birthday, Christmas, mother's Day, Father's day in a hotel room somewhere in the world where people didn't speak my language, the only people that associated with me where people who believe me to be their peer 10 years older than I actually was. I never got to go to his senior prom, high school football game. Share a relationship with someone my own age. I always knew I'd get caught. Only a fool would think otherwise. The last sometimes sleeps with the law. Never dies. I was caught. I went to some very bad places.

Speaker 2:          00:24:24       My boys have grown up asking their mother, why is it the dead gets up in the middle of the night and goes down the TV room cause you know he didn't turn the TV on. He just sits there all night as, because there are things you can forget things you're not meant to forget what I was sitting in that pitch black cell in France. My father 57 was climbing the subway stairs in New York as he did every day. He was in great physical shape. He just happened to trip. He reached his arm to break his fall. He slipped, hit his head on a railing, laying it at the bottom of the step. He was dead. I didn't know he was dead. I was thinking about them, how much I couldn't wait to see him, hold him, hug him, kiss him, tell him how sorry I was, but I never got the opportunity to do that.

Speaker 2:          00:25:04       I was very fortunate because I was raised in a great country where everyone gets a second chance. I owe my country 800 times more than I can ever repay it over these past four decades. That is why I'm at the FBI today. 32 years after the federal court order expired requiring me to do so. I have turned down three pardons from three sitting presidents of the United States because I do not believe no will I ever believe that a piece of paper, we'll excuse my actions. That only in the end my actions. Well, 40 plus years ago on an undercover assignment in Houston, Texas, I met my wife when the assignment was over. I broke protocol to tell her who I really was. I didn't have a dime to my name, but I eventually asked her to marry me against the wishes of her parents. She did, and I could sit up here and tell you that I was born again.

Speaker 2:          00:26:03       I saw the light prison rehabilitated me, but the truth is God gave me a wife. She gave me three beautiful children. She gave me a family and she changed my life. She and she alone. Everything I have, everything I've achieved, who I am today. It's because of the love of a woman and the respect three boys have for their father. Something I would never ever jeopardize. There comes a time in all of our lifetime, we grow older and eventually if we're fortunate enough, we have children and as every parent knows, whether your child is three months old or 38 years old, when you lay your head on a pillow at night, you're just about to close your eyes. The last thing you think about, last thing you worry about are your children. So if you still have your mother, you still have your father, you give him a hug, you give him a kiss, you're telling me you love them while you can.

Speaker 2:          00:26:59       And to those men in the audience, both young and old, I would remind you what it truly is to actually be a man has absolutely nothing to do with money, achievements, skills, complements degrees, professions, physicians, a real man loves his wife. A real man is faithful to his wife and real mat next to God and his country. Put his wife and his children as the most important thing in his life. Steven Spielberg made a wonderful film, but I've done nothing greater, nothing more rewarding, nothing more worthwhile, nothing makes actually brought me more peace, more joy, more happiness, more content in my life than simply being a good husband, a good father, and what I strive to be every day of my life. A Great Daddy. God bless you and thanks for coming this morning.

Speaker 1:          00:27:51       [inaudible] we have

Speaker 2:          00:28:00       bunch of questions, both a from the audience as well as some people have sent in. So we'll take some questions. I'll be happy. Good answer.

Speaker 3:          00:28:08       Do you have any advice for Googlers who are feeling imposter syndrome, the insecure feeling that they're not nearly as good at their jobs, at their job is their colleagues believe they are? And how did you stay confident or did you, when you knew you were, you were in an imposter?

Speaker 2:          00:28:27       You know, people always say to me, you know, you are brilliant. You are a genius. No, I was an adolescent and that was why I was successful. I was so young that I had no fear of being caught. I was so young then. I didn't think about consequences. Everything I did was not premeditated. Everything was done by opportunity or by chance. So if, in fact I was standing out in front of a bank in Manhattan with a $500 check, there was never a plan. I didn't say to myself, I'm going in cash check. If they say this, I'll do this. If they do this, I'll do that. I just went in and did it and I felt that there was nothing I couldn't do. I had tremendous confidence in myself, but everything was for a reason. So I saw that airline crew, I never dreamed about getting on planes or staying in hotels around the world for free.

Speaker 2:          00:29:16       All I saw was a uniform and said to myself, if it had that uniform on and I walked in a bank, it would be a lot easier to cash a check. Then me walking in is just some young kid. So the whole thing was to get a uniform and do that. But then I quickly realized the power of that uniform, how it turned from night today. No one ever said no. When I walked in to cash a check, even though there was no bank account there or anything else, all they saw was the uniform didn't see me and I realized very early on the power of that uniform and then I realized I had gone to the TWA ticket counter just like he showed in the movie. I was going to purchase an airline ticket and the ticket agents said to me, are you writing for free?

Speaker 2:          00:29:56       Are you buying the ticket? And I said, riding for free. Yeah, you are on the jumpseat. And I learned about the jump seat. So then I flew around the world for free. Everything I did, I did. By chance, I moved into an apartment complex in Atlanta. I said I was a doctor because I didn't want to write down airline pilot. They were looking for me with that airline pilot. So I said it was a doctor. I said pediatrician, because it was a singles complex and there were only single people living there. And then I met a doctor who lived there and then he took me up to the hospital and I met people. So I ended up at the hospital. I dated a flight attendant who's father was the attorney general in Louisiana. I had told her that I had gone to law school, but I never practiced law.

Speaker 2:          00:30:35       Instead, I wanted it to be a pilot and got furloughed from the airline. So she introduced me to her dad and I went to work. Everything was all these opportunities, but always a confidence that I could pull it off in that that became, uh, just from age. But if you believe that you're good at what you do and you strive to be good at what you do, you don't need to worry about what other people think. You need to be able to understand that you have your own confidence that you can do whatever it is you're required to do and other people will see that confidence in you. The minute you start doubting yourself, other people will see that, that you're doubting yourself and that becomes a weakness in your personality. So you always want to be confident in everything you do that you can do it, you can get it done, you'll find a way to get it. I get it done.

Speaker 4:          00:31:20       Obviously technology has evolved quite a bit since you were going around and things like that. Would somebody be able to accomplish something similar today even with all of the technical advancements?

Speaker 2:          00:31:31       Yeah. You know, I get asked that a lot, actually. It's sorry to say, but 4,000 times easier today than when I did it. A technology breach crime, and it always has and it always will and there will always be people willing to use technology. In a self serving a way. So you know, I always use the example that when I used to forge checks, I needed a Heidelberg printing press. It took me about 12 months to learn that press. That was a million dollar printing press who is 90 feet long, 18 feet high. It required three journeymen operators to operate it. So I bill scaffoldings on either sides of the press so I could eliminate the other two positions. And because I was a teenager, I was able to run the length of that press. But there were color separations, there were negatives, there were chemicals you had to work with, there were plates you had to make.

Speaker 2:          00:32:19       There was typesetting involved. I today, one just opens a laptop and decides to forge counterfeited check. They first bring up a diagram of a chick with a little security background in it and then they go and look on who's checked in and afford. So if I'm going to forge for example, into its check, I go to the company's website, capture their logo and put it up on the corner of the left part of the top of the check. I put it in their corporate address, I might put some stuff in the background and step and repeat patterns or whatever it is I'm designing. And in 15 minutes I have a four color beautiful check, prettier than the real check they use up on my website. Now, in the old days you to would have said to me, you know, um, this check you're printing from Pan Am I have to admit.

Speaker 2:          00:33:03       Pretty awesome. It's amazing for color. It's looks terrific. But uh, let me ask you this. How do you know where pan and banks, I have no idea whether it bank, so I'm just making up a bank's name, a chase Manhattan Bank, one Chase Plaza in New York. Yeah. How do you know what the account number is? I have no ideas. I'm just making up a bunch of numbers. How do you know who the authorized signer is? I Dunno, I'm just signing somebody, Joe Black, whatever name on that check. But we live in a way too much information world today. So one side forge, Intuit's check every forger calls their victim twice because every four Joe will tell you a victim will tell me everything I need to know. So when he calls, he would have simply said like, just speak to someone in accounts receivables. Sure. One moment counts receivables can help you.

Speaker 2:          00:33:49       Yeah, I was getting ready to pay an invoice you sent us, but we prefer to wire you. The funds just needed wiring instructions. Yes. So we banked with Bank of America. Account number is one seven six eight five three they tell you right on the phone you can call any company and just tell him you're going to wire the money. They're going to tell you where they bank on one street, their account number. But you need on the check. So I captured the bank's logo. I put it on the checkup at the mic or line down on the bottom and I hang up and call back into a corporation going help you. Yeah, I like to speak to someone in your corporate communications shareware moment. Corporate communications can help you. Yeah. I wonder if you'd be so kind of some mail me a copy of your annual report.

Speaker 2:          00:34:25       Sure. I'll send you one out today on page three is a signature of the chairman of the board, the CEO, the CFO, and the treasurer, white glossy paper, black ink camera ready arts scan it, digitize it, put it on the check. The technology has made it much, much easier when we talk about ids. Making an airline id today would be very simple with the technology that's available today. So all of those things are a lot easier. And so I used to say that we'd be a little more difficult for me to get on an aircraft today posing as a pilot. But if you ever go to the airport and watched the crews go through the airport, they just simply hold up a card and they go through the airport that anyone could make that card with today's software and technology that's available to anybody. So, uh, technology has certainly made it a lot easier. So that's why we're constantly making technology to counter the use of technology by criminals and to make it more difficult for them to convert that technology into a negative, uh, idea.

Speaker 3:          00:35:20       And your candid opinion, did Leonardo Dicaprio and Tom Hanks do justice t e two urine? Joseph, she's respective roles in the movie.

Speaker 2:          00:35:30       Yeah. You know, I'm, I'm not a big movie person, so I don't, I, I've watch very little television. This is most of my life, not just, I took up even as a kid, I didn't watch a lot of television. I don't watch a lot of television now. And I certainly very rarely go to movies. And, uh, so when it was announced that Leo had, was the person picked to play the part, I really knew nothing about them. My sons weren't too happy that it was Leo. But, uh, I didn't, I didn't know anything about them. So I went to the movies and saw street gangs of New York and I said to myself, sitting there, how would this person portray a person? 16 years old. He had a beard. He was at the time he filmed that movie was about 27, 28 years old. Uh, I thought no one's going to believe this guy 16, but because I'd never saw the script, I didn't know if maybe Spielberg was making the character a lot older and not a teenager.

Speaker 2:          00:36:20       Now when the movie came out, it was quite amazing that Leo starts out in the film at 14 and he's 16 and he's 18 and he's 21. Uh, he is an amazing character actor and he took the role and he did an amazing job of playing the role. Tom Hanks, his character was actually named Joe Shay, s, h e a who was an Irishman from Boston. Joe Shay was my supervisor at the FBI after I came out of prison. I answered directly to him and I were friends for 30 years until his death. I've written five books on crime. The last book I wrote stealing your life. I dedicated that book to him and our 30 year relationship. But he was an Irishman from Boston in which Tom Hanks, he didn't want his real name. You. So Tom Hanks used the name of an old football player and took that name call hand Randy. But if you are watching the screen for me it was like watching him. He looked like him. He sounded like him. He had his mannerisms. I did an amazing job. Uh, both of them and portraying the pots are real people that were still living at that time.

Speaker 5:          00:37:21       So first of all, as a father, your statement was just starting to tiering, totally practical with the Equifax hacks and yet them hacks that every one in this room has been probably affected by one of the other. Is there anything we can do as citizens to protect ourselves or is it a lost cause?

Speaker 2:          00:37:40       No, I'll tell you what to do. But let me explain this to you. That is where I, when I went to the FBI 41 years ago, I worked undercover for a long period of time. Then I went into the field and dealt with counterfeits and forgeries embezzlement at financial crimes. In the last 20 years, I've dealt with only cyber related crimes. So I spend most of my time with breaches. I have worked every breach back to Tj Maxx 15 years ago, and this is what I've learned. First of all, every single breach, every breach occurs because somebody in that company did something they weren't supposed to do, or somebody in that company failed to do something they were supposed to do. Hackers do not cause breaches. People do. And every bridge comes down to that. So in the case of Equifax, they didn't update their infrastructure.

Speaker 2:          00:38:32       They didn't fix the patches it should have put in place. They were very negligent and what they were doing. So the hacker waited for the door to open. So when you interview a hacker, the hacker will say to you, look, I can't get into chase bank. The truth is they spend about a half a billion dollars a year on technology. Every 12 months they spend a half a billion dollars of their profit on putting technology in software in their bank to keep me out. However, they employ 200,000 people worldwide. All I have to do is wait for one of those people to do something they weren't supposed to do or fail to do what they were supposed to do, and that'll open the door for me to get in a, when you steal credit card numbers, like home depot, target Tj Maxx, that's stealing credit cards and debit card information that has a very short, short shelf life, so you have to get rid of it very, very quickly.

Speaker 2:          00:39:25       But if I steal your name, your social security number and your date of birth, you can't change your name. You can change your social security number. You can't change your date of birth. So those people warehouse that data for two to three years. So we won't even see that surface for at least a couple of years before. Some of that will start to surface. The data that was stolen, whatever number they start with, I think was 143 million. Then it became 146 million. It was a million drivers licenses. Now it's 10.6 million drivers licenses. All breaches start with very low numbers before they let you know the actual true numbers. So it's probably about 240 million pieces of information that was stolen. But I remind people all the time that they're going to warehouse that data. So buying one year credit monitoring services absolutely worthless because nothing's going to happen in a year.

Speaker 2:          00:40:18       And if you really analyze, uh, Equifax, they were very unethical in what they did. They thought to themselves, first of all, they sold a bunch of stock knowing that it was going to come out. That was worse. But then they stat there and said, how do we make a profit from, this was our mistake, but how we turn this around into a profit. So they sat there and said, what we'll do is we'll offer millions of millions of people one year of credit monitoring service for free. They'll sign up and in a year from now, we'll simply say, that data hasn't really surfaced yet. You need to be enrolled automatically into our program, which is $20 a month. So they're going to make millions and millions of dollars would automatic enrollment into their, their program. Um, if you've been a breach, if you've been a subject of that breach, there's only two things you can do and two things.

Speaker 2:          00:41:05       Only one, you can freeze your credit. Uh, each state varies about that. So some states freezing your credit is free. Other states, there is a fee associated with it. Typically $10 to freeze it, $18 to unfreeze it, $10 to freeze it. Uh, again, uh, so for the last two years I've testified before Congress and you go to my website at [inaudible] dot com you'll see me testifying before Congress telling them that they need to pet a federal law across 50 states that allow anyone to freeze their credit at anytime and unfreeze it. And any time there should be no reason that there should be a fee associated with it because then that becomes a deterrent to people, uh, actually, uh, freezing their credit so you can freeze your credit. That's one thing you can do and then you unfreeze it if you need it. Um, if, if there's not too much of a hassle.

Speaker 2:          00:41:55       And then the only other thing is to monitor your credit. So I've used a credit monitoring service since 1992 so for about 25 years I've been using a service, I think they charged me like $12 a month. The reason I like it, I can monitor my own credit. I don't need them all they've given me for that $12 is the ability to go on my keyboard and a few strokes and bring up my credit reports instantly on my screen and up on my screen comes all three reports, Equifax, Experian, transunion. At the top is my score for the moment of that day, what my credit score is that those three agencies. Then I can scroll down and look at my credit and I can say to myself, you know, I paid this car off like four months ago. They still show that I owe money to this bank.

Speaker 2:          00:42:39       I have correct that and I can go all the way down and see every inquiry made on my credit. That's what we call hard and soft inquires. And that's your employer checking your credit, the IRS checking your credit, your insurance company, checking your credit or a credit card you applied for and they're checking your credit. So I really don't need them, but for fee, uh, they're also monitoring my credit as well. So they're checking my credit and they letting me know in real time if someone attempts to use my social security number to get a job opened, a bank account or whatever the case may be. So to me it's worth using that. Now one other tip I'll give you is I don't own a debit card. I've never owned one. I've never allowed my three sons to possess one, certainly in truly the worst financial tool ever given to the American consumer.

Speaker 2:          00:43:30       So a long time ago I asked myself a simple question, how would I remove 99.9% of my personal liability like that, where they really don't want to worry about all these things? So I use the safest form of payment that exists on the face of the earth and that is a credit card, credit card, visa, mastercard, American Express, discover card. Not Debit credit, but credit card. Every day of my life I spend their money. I don't spend my money. My money sits in a money market account. It earns interest. Actually nobody knows where it is because not exposed to anybody to find it. It's just sitting there. I go to the dry cleaner, I give him my card, I pick up the groceries, I give him my card, I put fuel in my boat on the weekend. I use my card. I paid the marina to keep my boat in the water.

Speaker 2:          00:44:17       All year long they put the rent on my credit card. I travel all over the world. Why wait to get reimbursed? I use my credit card if I need euro's, I go to the ATM machine. I used my credit card. I'm not gonna use my debit card to get euros or a pounds and Great Britain. And every day I use my card and then if I pay the bill in full or part of the bill, my credit score goes up. So I'm building credit while I'm using net credit card and if tomorrow, and I'll do everything to protect my information, but if tomorrow someone gets my card number and charges $1 million on my credit card by federal law, my liability is zero. I have no liability. So yes, I love to shop online. I don't use a special card, I just use my credit card if they don't deliver the merchandise, if they deliver it and it's broken.

Speaker 2:          00:45:09       If the host side I went to is fictitious to begin with, I have no zero lead zero liability. When you use your debit card, every time you reach for your exposing the money in your account, the only person's going to get robbed as you, when you use your debit card, you could use it for the next 50 years, 20 times a day. You will not raise your credit score by that much. And of course when you use your debit card you are liable up to a certain amount and it takes a while in order to get that debit card fixed. So when we do post investigations that breaches and we say to someone on your incident, what happened? While I was in target, but I used a visa card so I don't know nothing. I got to cancel my card the next day, two days later Fedex sent me a new card and that was the last I heard about it.

Speaker 2:          00:45:53       What about you? And I use the debit card there that took $3,000 out of my checking account. It took me two months to get my money back. Why? They said they were investigating. I had to pay my rent, had kids' tuition, everything. I couldn't pay it because they had my money. So I do it for that. So I had three sons that went off to college and I've said to them, I'm not giving you a debit card. I've actually applied for a credit card in your name. So chill card. Of course you're 18 you have no credit. So I guarantee the card. So as a guarantee or of the card, three things take place. One, the bill comes to me and I'm responsible for the bill. So if you spend a lot of time in the bar, I'm going to know that too. And I set the limit on the card.

Speaker 2:          00:46:32       So whatever I want you to spend each month is while you're at school, I'll set that limit. Third, every month that I pay, the bill goes on your credit. So by the time you get out of college, you should be looking at a credit score of about 800 you want to buy a car, buy a house, buy a condo. You're not going to need me to do that. All three of my sons came out of college with grades us scores of the round 801 of the best things you can do for your kids is to teach them to learn to use credit early on and build credit in their name. Credit is a very important thing. 30 years ago, it only meant when he got the car, he got the house. Today, everything is based on your credit. The company hires you, they're going to check your credit.

Speaker 2:          00:47:10       If your buy auto insurance is going to check your credit, you buy life insurance, I'm going to check your credit. Everything is based on your credit. So you want to make sure that you maintain a good credit and it's one of the best things you can do with your kids. Question, I wanted to ask you more about the FBI specifically and kind of uh, hiring and how you got in. There is such an interesting story. Um, you know, when I was younger I was really interested in, you know, working for the FBI, worked in fraud and security. Um, if my boss is watching, I'm very happy where I am right now. Uh, but, uh, I couldn't believe how difficult it was to try and get into public service. I thought, you know, there's, you know, I was willing to take a pay cut. I was willing to move anywhere.

Speaker 2:          00:47:52       I was willing to do anything and it was difficult. I mean it was in touch with people at the FBI and they were super nice and very helpful, but I just couldn't believe that, you know, the background checks and there's no available jobs and you have to keep emailing me and Oh you don't have a lot of Gri. Oh that's not going to matter. And you know, again, I ended up in a great spot so I'm happy. But uh, when people ask me about public service and working for these organizations, I really don't have an answer. The FBI is extremely tough. We have about 13,000 agents, uh, and about 25,000 support people who support the agent analysts and things of that nature. Um, currently we'd take one in every 10,000 applicants to be an agent. So it is extremely difficult to get in the FBI.

Speaker 2:          00:48:38       So just to share the story with you, my oldest boy, when he was about 14, I used to take my kids to the FBI Academy, which was on a marine military base in Quantico, Virginia. Cause I like to shoot guns on the range and I would take them up there and while I was teaching class, they would be out there with the instructor, a shooting on the range. And I remember distinctly coming back off the base, which takes you about 20 minutes to get from the academy off to the base. And when we were riding through the base, he said to me, no dad, this is what I want to do. I want to become an FBI agent. I said, well that's great son, but you know, keep that in mind. And so he graduated from high school. He said to me, I really want to become a FBI agent.

Speaker 2:          00:49:18       I said, that's great. You know, you've got to go to college. So he went to school at University of Kansas, got his undergraduate. He kept, I always thought he changed his mind. Um, my wife always had a Christmas party for all the agents in Tulsa. We had about 200 FBI agents in the state. And uh, every Christmas they would be at our home with their family and he would go talk to all of them. In the special agent in charge who's in charge of the entire state. He would say to him, yeah, my son tried to get in. But uh, they turned them down and he explained to him that senator's sons had been turned down. Former president's sons had been turned down, has nothing to do with anything other than you. And I kept emphasizing that to him, but I kept thinking he changed his mind.

Speaker 2:          00:50:00       So when you graduated from undergraduate scores said, Sanjay, I would recommend you go to law school. I have no desire to be a lawyer. I said, I understand, but if you really want to pursue the FBI and that would put you up a little higher and the chances of getting in it went to Loyola School of law, graduated from law school. Their bureau requires you pass the bar. So it took the bar in Illinois, passed the bar and then he went through the year long process of the process to takes to apply to the bureau. And I got very worried because I'd say to my wife that, you know, I'm a little concerned because first of all, I don't know if someone in management would like the fact that my son is an FBI agent, or maybe someone in management would look at it and say, his dad has done so much for him, for them, we need to look at his son.

Speaker 2:          00:50:43       It had absolutely nothing to do with that was all about him. And I always tell him every day he's living his life a dream. So He's, he, he got in, but it is very, very tough. So when the bureau came to me and they just a few years ago, celebrated their hundredth anniversary, they did a big coffee table book and they talk about me in there as being the only person they ever did that with. Uh, the whole thing to the bureau back then, the director was Clarence Kelly, who was the director of the bureau at that time. He wanted the ability, because he could say to me, okay, you are a lieutenant in the army. You had been in the army this many years, you're expertise is this missile. I need you to learn all of this and two weeks and I'm sending you to this base and I want you to find out what's going on in this particular area.

Speaker 2:          00:51:33       He knew that no matter what assignment he gave me undercover, I could go do it. Whether it was a scientist at a lab in New Mexico, whether it was a doctor in a hospital, he knew that I could get away with it, make it believe people believe that I was that person without any doubt. And that's how they used me. Um, I think that was their initial thing. And then of course when my time was up, and again, keep in mind that when I got that offer to me, it was just an opportunity. I looked at it, well, opportunity to get out of jail. I, I'm not going to sit here and tell you I was a changed person, that I was a different person. And when I went into prison, I just saw that as an opportunity to get out of prison. So I was going to do it.

Speaker 2:          00:52:12       But then I, you get involved with the men and women of the FBI who obviously is probably the most ethical people you'll ever meet in your life that have tremendous character, love of country, love of family. That kind of wears off on you. And I started to realize that, you know, I met my wife and I was becoming a husband. I take care of my wife, had take care of children, uh, fatherhood, all those things is what really changed my life. Wasn't that I was rehabilitated or those things changed my life. So if it started out more as an opportunity, so when my time was over and the court said his court order is, ceases to be, he's free to do whatever he wants to do, I made the choice to stay there only because I thought that I could bring a lot to the bureau.

Speaker 2:          00:52:54       So the bureau was very smart. They realize very early on that I wouldn't be accepted very well. And so there was a great scene in the movie where Steven Spielberg, uh, obviously knew that I was very, very difficult for the agents. You gotta keep in mind now this is back when there were no women agents, no blacks, no Hispanics, everybody was white agent and they either graduated from Harvard or the graduated from Yale and they all came from very good families and it was a totally different environment 40 years ago. So they all have really tunnel vision once a criminal, a criminal. So they were not very, very happy with the fact that I came there. So he showed that scene and me walking in the office and, uh, the way people looked at me, that took years for me to turn that around, took years for me to build their credibility.

Speaker 2:          00:53:40       And of course in the first part of my career was out in the field, so as undercover, so there really weren't dealing with me. So when I finished working on the cover that the director then simply said, you know what? It needs to go to the academy and teach class so that every agent who comes to the academy, they will, he will be their instructor in one of their courses and they will all know him. So I've taught at the academy now for well over 35 years. I taught my son when he went through the academy, three generations of agents. And that helped a great deal because they learned who I was early on, knew who I was. And that changed a lot of that. But it took a lot of, lot of, lot of work to turn that around and build that credibility. I'm curious to know whether or not you continued to fly even after you were released from jail and working at the bureau as the movie suggests, or if that was a bit of Hollywood in now.

Speaker 2:          00:54:31       You know, when people ask me, um, and I, I saw the movie in a movie theater. I've only seen the movie twice. I've seen that trailer a thousand times, but I've only seen the movie twice. So when the media asks me what I thought about the movie and what was right and what was wrong, I said, you know, well, first of all, I have two brothers and a sister. He portrayed, portrayed me as an only child, uh, in real life. My mother never remarried. There's a scene in the movie where she's remarried as a little girl. That didn't really happen, um, in the real life. I never saw my father after I ran away, uh, in the movie, they keep having him come back to Christopher Walken and the film was nominated for the Academy award for that role as my father. Uh, that didn't really happen.

Speaker 2:          00:55:12       I escaped off the aircraft, but I escaped off the aircraft through the kitchen gallery where they bring the food and stuff onto the plane. And there they had made scape through the toilet and my wife kind of looked at me and said, you didn't go through the toilet. They yes and no. I didn't go through the toilet. Um, so I thought he stayed very close to the story. But, um, pretty much all of that was, he was, he was very concerned about being accurate first of all, because it was a, it was the first time he made a movie about a real person living second. The bureau had an information officer on the set for all the, all the shooting of the entire film to make sure that what he said about the FBI and what comments they made and all that was accurate. The agent, there was an agent from our information officer on the, on the set, and then of course is he later said, I really got most of my information from those three retired agents because they said they, their notes were so particular and so accurate.

Speaker 2:          00:56:08       He said that when I filmed the scene in the hotel room, I had scripted it. And so we're sitting there and I said, a read me your notes. He said, I entered the room with my gun pulled, I heard someone in the bathroom, I ordered them to come out of the bathroom and this is what happened. He basically loved his notes better than his script. So he used his notes for the southern film. So I thought he did a good job of staying a very, uh, very accurate. The movie. I just make a final common to, uh, having to deal with cyber. Now I like to write about crimes in the future. Uh, so I always used to write to my class about what will we investigate five years from now, what will the agent be doing five years from now? And unfortunately, um, there's good news and there's bad news.

Speaker 2:          00:56:56       First of all, the good news, we will be doing a way with passwords in the next 24 months. Passwords will leave the world. There will be no more passwords. There is a new technology called True Sona. That's t r U. S. O n a stands for true persona. It is a company in Scottsdale, Arizona that created a technology for the CIA, which we have used now for the last few years. That technology. Uh, and I was an advisor on that technology for the CIA. So I'm an advisor and bringing it to the commercial world. But it was the ability for an agent to send data back from the fields such as Afghanistan on their iPhone. And that Langley would know 100% that is the agent on the other end to 100% identify the person on the other end of the device. That's a level for security. So that they basically said, what if we brought this to level two security?

Speaker 2:          00:57:53       And we did away with passwords. So immediately when they announced that Microsoft gave them $10 million and said, I'm in develop it, so Microsoft is going to use it on all their gaming, all their access to their computers, etc. We now have the ability to identify who the person is on the other end of that, uh, device. And when you go to their website at True Sona, they actually show you how it's done. So they show you the demo videos there that are three or four minutes long that show you how it's done. And that's great. Passports or stack of passwords are stagnant. They should have been gone long time ago. It's why we have most of the problems that we have today. So it is very important that we get rid of passwords. And just in case you didn't know, if we take a bank like a bank of America, they spend about $6 million a month in their call center, resetting passwords, cost them $6 million a month.

Speaker 2:          00:58:42       So that would save that bank $100 million a year to eliminate the use of passwords. So that's the good part of it. And I think that will eventually do away with social security numbers. You'll still have a number assigned to you for the government purpose. But when I go buy a car, I go to the doctor, I don't have to give them a number because they already know who I am through my device. I won't have to provide a social security number. So I think that's the good part. But I do believe that cyber it up until this point in time has been used for financial crimes or gathering data and information, which is a value. What's going to happen is we're going to see cyber very quickly now turned black. So we have the ability, as you know, uh, to basically shut someone's pacemaker off, but we have to be within 35 feet of them.

Speaker 2:          00:59:30       We test these device at Quantico all the time. So as long as I walk up within 35 feet of you, I take control of any bodily device you have on you. So if I want to assassinate you, I want to speed it up, take it down, I can do that. But I believe that in five years you'll be able to do that from 5,000 miles away. We have the ability, now that we test that we can chase a car down the interstate. We got to get up with them 35 feet of the vehicle. We take over the vehicle, we shut the motor off, we lock the person in the car, we locked the power windows so they can't open them and we can turn on their air bag again. Five years from now, you'd be able to do that 5,000 miles away. So yes, our electrical grid uses a terrorist tool.

Speaker 2:          01:00:14       The ability to shut down an entire system, shut down an entire banking system. Uh, those are all the things that unfortunately we'll be dealing with in the next four or five a year as cyber starts to make that turn to the very black side of cyber, not just about stealing money, information and data. And, uh, so that's why we're going to have to work extra hard to make sure that we go back to protect our electrical grid. We, I always remind people we have the technology to prevent most of these problems, but if you don't use it, then it's worthless. And we tend to develop a lot of things. Uh, I just want to make this emphasis, do we develop a lot of things without following them through? So one thing I've done in the government over the last several years, if the government is going to buy a technology, they send me to the technology company and say, try to defeat that.

Speaker 2:          01:01:06       I could simply go there and see their technology has one CEO says he plays chess with you. You tell me you did this, this, and this, and then he tells you we have a weakness right here because I would come in and do this. So they build a wall up and then he says, no, I would still get in here until he says he can't do it any longer than we know. We have a good technology, but very rarely is an, I did that with true sona when we did it for the purpose of the CIA. But today, uh, you, and it tells you on the website that I advised in that project and why, how it became down to commercial use. But today what we have is we develop things. So we say to you, here's a device you put in your kitchen, and then you can talk to her to tell you, ask what the weather is, what's on TV, denied.

Speaker 2:          01:01:48       Um, all of that, that I could easily reverse that and listen to everything you say in your house. There are so many weaknesses in your home. Your security cameras or access points, your remote control on your TV, your Samsung television, your refrigerator, that tells you how much, uh, milk, isn't it? My thing is I really don't need my refrigerator to talk to my toaster. They've gotten along for a long time without ever having a conversation. But what happens is we develop something we get real excited about where I get this to the marketplace. And sure enough, we never look at the negative side. All I tried to say to a technology company, yeah, this is great. Now can you take a little time to just say, how would someone use this technology and the negative self serving way so that we build the block to that before we ever give it to the public to use it. We'd, we'd save a lot of problems. Been absolute pleasure spending the morning with you. Thank you very much for coming.
