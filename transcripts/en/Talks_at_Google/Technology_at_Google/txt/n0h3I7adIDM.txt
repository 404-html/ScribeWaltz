Speaker 1:          00:00:06       Before I invite Tina up. I'd like to tell you a little bit about her experience. She has over 20 years of experience working with children and families and is the current parent trainer for the early early support program for autism and four d RTP research program in the past she was the director of the Easter Seals Bay area autism program as well as the director of the Pacific Autism Center for education and early intervention. And she's also completed trainings with multiple developmental based approaches and has trained and supported teams of developmental therapists, behavioral interventionists and teachers to develop successful programs for children on the autism spectrum. Join me in welcoming Gina stage.

Speaker 2:          00:00:59       Okay. Oh thank

Speaker 3:          00:01:00       you. I'm happy to be here. Thank you all for attending and all those remotely. So I have packets here today and I'm just going to point out a few things. What I'm currently doing is the early support program for autism. It's called s spa. Awesome. And I want to point this out ahead of time because I certainly will go through, um, some resources at the end. However you could call s Ba. It's completely free at any time and ask questions and get resources. And this is a collaboration between Stanford Children's Health Council. You'll talk to Christina, it's done in English and Spanish. It's 100% free. There's no boundaries when it comes to where you're located, the age of the individual you're calling about or what resources we've had. Um, infants come through, uh, with parent concerns up to adults calling for themselves to get resources. They may not always get directed to me for the parent training piece.

Speaker 3:          00:02:03       However, we do find resources, um, and back way to parent co call from Florida, uh, for resources for her daughter who attends Stanford as a sophomore who is on the autism spectrum. And so whatever calls we get, Christina will seek out information and uh, and then she'll also tell you about any research going on if you're interested in research programs with Stanford or elsewhere. And also if you're interested in this parent training, it's a one on one parent training with me. It's done over four sessions. It's, there's no time constraints to this. You can do it remotely or in person. And again, it's 100% free. And did we, based in, because it's one on one, we talk about your child and techniques to help in any given situation with your child and your family as a whole unit. And then there's other in here. What about additional free classes that CMHC offers? Um, and, and Christina can even speak on those if you have any questions. So I'm going to get into this a PowerPoint and typically it takes me, um, more than an hour. And so if I don't get through every slide, don't worry about it because there is overlap and this, and I don't typically stick to the slides anyway. So this is just a lot of information about children's health council. And you can look at that, uh, at your convenience.

Speaker 3:          00:04:26       We're going to talk about a child's success and looking at it from a developmental approach. Um, and we will look in particular at the interactive environment, how to create a successful environment for both you and your child to connect and stretch their skills and then creating opportunities and finding those teachable moments. And for parents, especially, it's about finding those moments throughout the flow of the day where when you have programs set up, they'll do more intensive stuff. But certainly these techniques are really important to know. Um, and to, to hold everyone working with your child to a high standard of, um, getting these individually, these opportunities to teach and teaching.

Speaker 3:          00:05:13       So when we talk about creating an interactive environment, it, it's really pivotal. If we want success, we set a child up for success and success does build success. So the more opportunities they have to be successful, and sometimes we call it the, the preemptive strike, we're going to call it success before it is. We create that confidence and we can keep building on it. Um, but in setting up the environment for success, again, for both you and your child. And so we look at the yes items and those are the teachable items. The no items or our conversation stoppers, they stop and interaction. And so yes, items are redirection. It's our items we can say yes to and then teach. And you know, we, I look, we've worked with parents to find these in everything. And so for, if I'm working with a child in a room, the child doesn't know me and sometimes we'll go to the door and you'll see this later in the slide.

Speaker 3:          00:06:14       I really want to be a good audience to receive all of the child's communication. And when they don't have the language, I put the language to it. However, I'm going put all my energy and excitement to my yes item. So if they try to open the door and I said, oh, not time flat affect flat tone. I say not time to open the door yet, but we can open bubbles, we can open, played out in all my energy goes to my yes and my excitement goes to my yes. I'm not going to spend a lot of time explaining and no a way like don't touch that. No, it's not time to go outside. We could do that later because what happens is it's, it's even as an adult when we hear no, it's a bit of a staying and we're listening a little less right.

Speaker 3:          00:06:55       For kids, they almost grab on to that what they were working towards, that no item a little harder. And that's where we see the fits are, that's where we see, um, not really interacting with you so much, especially if we're constantly, oh no, don't do that. Nope. Take it out of your mouth. Oh No, don't touch that. Well, we're, we're not really interactive where the no person, so we want to find the yeses in, in as much as possible in these situations. I do teach no, but tick typically it's in an interaction. It's in a game. If I say, you know, is the ball over on the chair? And I said no with huge gestures and a big response, really obvious gestures, a point and everything else. Um, and then when I buy a third time, I always find it's my, yes, yes. Um, so we really want to find those yeses and, and keep away from the nose.

Speaker 3:          00:07:51       If, if it is a no flat affect, flat tone, we don't want to give a lot of energy towards it. No. You know, with kids in general, whether there's a diagnoses or not, uh, that energy gets a response. So if it's a exciting no or an exciting yes, it doesn't matter. So we want the yeses to be where our excitement goes. Um, providing interactive items. So we want to look for items that create back and forth because the teaching comes through connection. And then that, so social loops of interaction, you know, teaching an isolated ways does work. We don't always see it generalized into other environments or with other people. And so in these, uh, this approach that I'll talk about today, it's, it's really looking at the everything being taught through loops of interaction. Because the ultimate goal is for this individual I'm working with to go and share these tools with their peers, not with me or not with other, what we call manual, a predictable in their control.

Speaker 3:          00:09:01       Adults. That'll be in the slide too. Um, so interactive items, and I know that Google, however, we stay away from tech as much as possible. I can't be as exciting as tech. Right? The, the what? Everything I'll ask you to be today is what kids get from, you know, what they're watching on youtube or in video or um, the songs and dance and all that colorful stuff. Certainly there's things we can teach to that, especially for watching as well and doing some pausing and kind of, um, acting it out or asking questions. But it is limited. Uh, we want, we don't want, we get rid of our competition. So tech would be my competition. I want items that I can bring the fun too. It's not the object is there to support the play. However the person is the primary focus. Uh, that object is not fun without me involved.

Speaker 3:          00:10:06       So you're looking for items that don't have the bells and whistles, the lights and the, the noise is the battery items. Um, so ideally really basic toys. I like items like a, what's called ICOM, a poll tube and you just pull it along and you can spin it. You can do all kinds of stuff. So thinking of items that you can get a child excite to look you're way more often and wants you to do it again. And again to promote functional language, um, creating an interactive environment. Again, be a good sensory detective. So typically when I do this talk, I do this kind of experimental or I try to give you some type of taste of what sensory may be going on with the child and we're always doing our best guests because we cannot say what affects a child. We can observe and we can make best guesses.

Speaker 3:          00:11:05       Um, however, when we're talking about young kids in general, we know that their sensory system is immature. When we're talking about child who's not hitting all those milestones the way we expect them to, we're going to kind of guess that there is some, there are some interruptions and their sensory development. And so being a good sensory detective is investigating the environment setting. Again, the environment up for success is getting rid of items that are going to be an issue. So I work with a little boy now who will mouth a lot of soft plastics. I don't bring soft plastics into the session. I'll bring hard plastic toys. I bring items that I can create interaction, but I am not going to spend time taking things out of their mouth. I also will make sure there's a replacement for items like that. So if a child is mild thing for being a sensory detective, I view that as there's a need there.

Speaker 3:          00:12:02       And as a responsible adult I need to help that child meet that need so they don't have to keep seeking out items to meet it themselves. And so replacement, yes items is really important. Um, you know, having, you know, your work with an occupational therapist may end of times they'll use it to a chewy and uh, you know, some kids do well with that, some don't or they get bored after a while. So they'll do it for a little bit, but they'll still grab the other items. Having other items that might provide more input. Um, dish wash cloth, a dry wash cloth, does that, cause they can get it back into areas that a chewy doesn't get and, and it kind of can, it's more malleable. It can get into, it gets wet and then you can move it around a lot more. It's an acceptable item.

Speaker 3:          00:12:52       Um, some, I know parents who have done handkerchiefs, so they're always accessible that way. So looking for again, yes items even, um, teething rings still. I mean when they come out of the freezer sometimes that can give a nice relief or whatever's going on and you know, also trying lots of different pressure and areas, which if you work with a good occupational therapists, they work a lot on the sensory system too. And they'll put a child on what they call a sensory diet, which is deep input, different type of movements for development. Um, you also want to make changes to the environment. Again, you know, if a, if a child get rid of the no items, but also if, if the law and you have great lights here, in fact, part of my, um, experiment I do is the shaking the lights and off and on and shaking a bag, making lots of noise and it drives most parents crazy and you can't focus.

Speaker 3:          00:13:47       And I said, that's a little taste of what may be going on, that what you're asking out of your child. They're filtering through all those layers of, of sensory issues. So yeah, it takes time to process. If they could do it easily, they would be doing it easily. And so to acknowledge that it is hard and so we need to set up that environment to give as much success as possible. Um, so you know, having access to a trampoline or being beggar, even cushions for deep pressure or being able to jump in on the bed, doing, um, tight, uh, rolling a child up in a blanket tightly and back out, uh, which we call a Burrito and kids love it and we'd get lots and lots of language out of activities like that because number one, they can't do themselves. We were, we have to be a part of it.

Speaker 3:          00:14:41       And number two, it relaxes their body and gives him the light blood, nice input. And so they do what more and more. So I keep stretching with as we continue and I get them more engaged, excited about their activity. Um, so you want to remove items that are an issue, support, sensory regulation. You know, if you look at activities online, you just want to try different things to really have a nice array of sensory movement, sensory input activities. And it depends on what the child is seeks out or voids. Um, you know, again, there's a lot of good oh, occupational therapists out there and if you're not working with one, their websites will give you a lot of tips as well. You can also search, which I've done many times to get ideas as brain gym and then I'll just look at the images under brain gym and he'll give me ideas of helping a child move their body in different ways.

Speaker 3:          00:15:41       So they are what they call crossing the mid point and working both sides of the brain. Um, things that when we don't do for a while and then you try to do it, you realize it's not as easy as you thought, like jumping jacks and then I'll try to do, and I'm like, oh, I think I forgot how to do a jumping jack or jumping rope. I'm skipping right. Sounds like no big deal. If you haven't done it for a while, try it. You'll realize your brain's lost a little of that. You can get it back, but it takes practice and really paying attention to the child's ongoing needs. One of the things you want to be as a good sensory detective, there's just sit step, you know, step back and observe and observe the finer details of what your child is doing that you may want to look for ways to support. Because if we can't be a partner in this, we can be, um, play a role and the need to open and shut a door and all of a sudden it's our idea. Instead of US stopping them constantly from doing it, they're going to turn more and more to you as a partner instead of somebody that no person in that,

Speaker 3:          00:16:56       um, position yourself for eye contact. You want eye contact, make it really easy be at his or her I love are lower and then capture it. You'll see it later. And again, I jumped around the slides, but reinforce it, everything you want to see how that child more often reinforce, oh good luck and do it with that nice energy. Um, but if, if, if you're, if you're working or you have a child who doesn't have nice eye contact and you want it, set them up for success, make it really easy, take all the obstacles out of it and then reinforce it each and every time. And I know sometimes it's quick, but I mean I will capture it con if I'm working on it, I'll get it each time, even if and moving and then I get to slow it down a little bit more and a little bit more.

Speaker 2:          00:17:43       Yeah.

Speaker 3:          00:17:43       Promote reciprocal interaction. Again, everything we teach through loops of interaction. And so you'll see it later in the slide, but that pause is really important. And for that anticipation of, I know I'm going to get something back and I'm available to receive it back. Um, and you know, many times when I, I'll work in a room with no distractions and where I don't have to run after a child a lot to get eye contact. Um, and so that way we can do a lot more of the back and forth reciprocal interaction. She might look at space like that and make it a space that a child wants to stay in because it's so much fun because you bring the fun to it. Um, offer visual steps when necessary and schedules. So, you know, it's, it's more impactful of a learning opportunity. If we see it, we hear and we experienced it, I have a better chance of taking that skill with me.

Speaker 3:          00:18:43       So visuals are really important. Whether I'm an actual item, uh, icon, a picture of an item, or I do it in gestures like, Oh, do you want pizza or chicken? And there's nothing there. But it helps with visualization, which helps with, when kids do get into chapter books and things like that, you know, you have to be, it's the same as social comprehension. You have to be for reading comprehension, able to visualize the characters. Visualize the environment and then start making predictions of what could happen. And that's the same for that social piece. That's why it's so hard. There's all those unwritten rules of what it means to socialize and be successful. Um, and so you want to make it really obvious and schedule sometimes help visual steps help. One of the things you want to be careful is to do us too many schedules and then you get a more rigid individual, right?

Speaker 3:          00:19:42       We want flexibility within those schedules. So if I have a schedule planned out, why it might have a special activity in that. Um, you know, if you're going, if you drive disk, a child to school every day and you have options to go multiple routes, you want to take a left turn next time instead of our right turn when you go on walks. She wanted to explore, be curious and go different directions. Um, we can do a lot of flexible, um, demonstrations even with our speech. So if I say go shut the door, I can also say go close. The door means the same thing and people say it differently. And so you want to vary your language, uh, for Nice flexibility as well.

Speaker 2:          00:20:28       Okay.

Speaker 3:          00:20:29       When we're creating opportunities, and some of this I'll go through in more detail, you want to be manageable, predictable in a child's control. You know, the, the social world, um, a lot of things in, in an individual's life are not manageable, predictable in their control. And so it's scary and that's, and, and especially if their sensory issues. And so that's where you see a child runoff or bite or hit wanting to get out of what's a very scary situation. Um, and so as adults, we can be that. Within that we can, we will expect flexibility and we'll, we'll try and challenge a child in a healthy manner. Um, and we'll go into that in more detail and be irresistible, right? Be the fun of the play and make it obvious. You know, what you're, what it looks like. Um, invite your child to take healthy risk.

Speaker 3:          00:21:23       Uh, you know, that's really important for them. It's a little scary, but if I can be manageable, predictable, and the control and, and, and give little pieces of a risk and risk is very different for different kids. I had a bean bag one time in a room where a child does a lot of, uh, really more academic work and not the social piece. And he sat in a beanbag and I thought, oh, I'm going to do a sensory social activities, we call it. And so I went and I picked the beanbag up. You know, I kind of gave pressure and I just picked it up. I said, oh, oh, oh, just to my knees. And he was scared. And so I went down, down, down, and I did not let go because I knew he would be out of that bean bag. And I know he'll enjoy it if he can see that it is manageable, predictable in his control that is safe.

Speaker 3:          00:22:15       So I do it again. Oh Oh, ah, down, down, down and again later in slide always comes up for, I have a very clear beginning, middle and end to my routine and I'm going to do it at least three times the rule of three. If a child needs it more cause I think, oh, he still needs a little more, he looks scared but he's starting to relax and I'll do it more typically three does it for me and I'll do it again. Uh, oh, ah, known down, I put him down again and then I let go and he stayed in and he actually set up up, up. Right. So I do it again up at this time. I go all the way up and I go down and we did a few more times and he tells me up, up, up for more. It's a more, because what I really want now is for him to say, I have got them, I've captured them into this activity.

Speaker 3:          00:23:07       But now, uh, up, is it really appropriate? You can tell me more. That would be more appropriate. So I say more and I do up, up, up, and then I add something to it. I had this spin and if I spend a child one way, I always spin, spin them the other way. Again, it's more impactful for our child, so if a child's running around a lot or spinning, get them to grow. Tate reverse. I see reverse go the other way. So I started teaching those words by defining them. At the same time we're doing them and it's, they won't need as much spinning. You know? Some kids can spin constantly, get not get dizzy, spin them one way and spend them the other way. Their bodies are impacted in a more satisfactory way and they won't need as much spinning and stuff are running around.

Speaker 3:          00:23:55       It's hard to, if a child's running in a circle and you say, stop, reverse. I mean they, they're in this momentum. It's even a child without a diagnosis. They have a trouble then going the other way and I hold them to it. Anything I ask of a child, I hold them to it. Whether I helped them or not, whether they do it independently or not, doesn't matter to me, but I do hold them to the expectation. So they know that I'm always going to hold you to these expectations and those expectations. If this is where their skill level is, I'm doing the next step. I'm not leaping, you know, we're not doing brain surgery now. I want success. And so it set next step.

Speaker 4:          00:24:33       MMM.

Speaker 3:          00:24:34       So this is a very healthy, healthy risk for a child. And I know he's going to love it. And so I keep adding onto this activity. You and I start teaching, no, yes, in this activity. Because if you give him a choice or if I say, do you want to go down? He'll say, go down. He just repeats, right? The last couple of words. Um, and so I want him to say yes or no. So I started teaching yes and no in this activity, going up, doing some spins, and it was in a playful way of, instead of putting them on the floor, I'd say down, down, down on the counter. And that was a know that. And so I would have again by three, I was on down, down on the floor. Yes, yes. And then I, next time I'd say down, down like on the chair and I'd wait for him to answer no. After I demonstrate it a few times and then he would start, start to go, no. I'm like no. And then get to the yes item.

Speaker 4:          00:25:35       MMM.

Speaker 3:          00:25:37       By doing these things again, being manageable, predictable and its controller, rarely much more interactive partner in this and be responsive, which is that thank you's. And you'll see that in another slide. So being manageable. These are some nice questions to ask yourself. You know, grabbing things out of a child's hands, not manageable, uh, moving too quickly. You want that slow approach. You want those pauses and ah, and, and sounds and sounds, your activities, they know it's coming again with a child, with the diagnoses are not my child. There are other child doesn't matter to me. I always do these type of techniques and you get a more of a buy in by doing these type of techniques. So, even if I'm about to just tickle or something, you know, it's coming because you know, ticklings one of those things that there's a little bit of fun too, but mostly it's not a fun activity because you get a kid's cracking up, but you keep doing it and they've already passed that enjoyable, um, kind of fine line, but they're laughing stills you keep at it.

Speaker 3:          00:26:44       Um, and so, you know, being really manageable, predictable in their control for stuff like that. So you always, I always show a child my approach like you come to so he'd know it's coming. They're cracking up from the anticipation because it's much funnier than the actual tickles. And they'll say, ah, tickle, tickle, tickle, and then right back up. But, you know, I'm not too far where if my approach is way over there, it's not so much fun. Or if I'm too close, it's a little scary. It's really manageable. Um, and that anticipation is really important for social anticipation. Being able to read something, anticipate what's going to happen by reading the environment, the, the body language, his facial affect, the movements, um, is so important for social success. And we can teach that early on with those pauses. Ah, ah, you know, and have that sound to it. And I'll even do multiply. And you know, kids think it's much funnier than if I just went in and start tackling. Plus you get a child looking more and tracking. Um, so either attending instead of just getting the needs met and then being gone.

Speaker 4:          00:27:54       MMM.

Speaker 3:          00:27:54       You know, being really careful through removing things from kids hanging. If I, if a child is playing with a car or something, I'm going to join them exactly what they're doing. However, I'm going to have my own car. I mean, won't personally be my, I'll probably be another one of his or hers, but still I don't ever take the child's item from them. Even if I'm trying to demonstrate, I do it by joining them and then offer something in addition to what they're already finding mastery and pleasure from. Um, being careful about standing behind her above. I mean, none of us liked somebody too close behind us. It's uncomfortable if I am behind a child and I'm going to help them with something, I put my hands out in front and say, um, I'm here in my hands, I'm going to help. And then I might help them do hand over hand or something like that. Picking up a child. Same thing. Mine or not, it doesn't matter to me. I'll say, I'm gonna pick you up and I don't wait for a yes or no. I might tell him, why am I, oh, we're going across the big street and pick you up and then I pick up or you know, this car. So you have to hold my hand and then I take him. But I let them know what's going to happen. I make myself available and then I have followed through to that.

Speaker 4:          00:29:04       Um, um, being, being

Speaker 3:          00:29:06       predictable again, helping them anticipate what's coming. And you do that with the pauses, make sure they know what their role is and what your role is in that. So sometimes it's explicitly saying that. And you know, as parents, I think we all do this is we put things in a question instead of a comment and you know, I know better to do that. And I still seem to throw a question at the end. I'll say, oh, time for bed. Okay. And I think, why am I doing it? Okay. It's not, I'm not asking, I'm stating, um, and so if you're not asking, don't put it in a question form when you say, Oh, do you want to play or can I play with you? I wouldn't ask. You're gonna because you're probably going to get a no. Unless you're going to accept that no walk away or let's try it.

Speaker 3:          00:29:58       You want to try it this way? And then it's like, no, well then I would join exactly what they're doing and it's, Oh, I'm going to try it like this. And then you demonstrate what you're going to try. But you want to make it clear what's expect. No, I can step up to an expectation if they don't know what it is. And so making that very clear, what is expected with little language and gestures, right? Put you don't have to explain things away. What you want is that follow through. And the more they can follow nonverbal gestures, the more they're watching. And the more you're helping increase their observation skills for observing peers, learning how to know what's going on and that social setting, which will help them know how to join and maintain the social interaction. Um, and giving that time again with the sensory issues that may be going on, processing time is really important.

Speaker 3:          00:31:07       So if I say, Oh, do you want water? And they don't answer, I'm like, water, do you want the water? Do you want, you want a drink of water? Each time I speak, it's like starting all over. So I ask and then they start processing the information that I ask again. It's like, okay, I start processing again. Then yes, different ways to, sometimes we touch, look at me, which is very overwhelming, right? Skins our largest Oregon taking in stimulation. And so then I've got a process that in addition to you talking, in addition to is maybe some demand you're putting on me in addition to lights, uncomfortable chairs, temperature, whatever else is going on, hearing a fan, um, you know, we can all sit here and ignore many things in tune in. Uh, I wouldn't, I wouldn't assume your child can do that and I wouldn't assume your child knows what's expected out of them.

Speaker 3:          00:32:10       I was working with a little boy of the day and he said something about soccer. So I'm like, oh, I have an idea, you know? And so I said, we had a ball and I say, well, let's play soccer. You're going to kick the ball. And I'm the goalie and I have to stop it. And he couldn't act on any of it. And so I kind of made it really obvious of what it looked like. And then, and so his mom later told me, he has no idea what soccer is or anything else you just said. Well, he's the one who brought it up. So I, I assumed he knew. And for all of these specialties, social activities, even things like tag, it seems like a pretty simple game. But unless you play with your child and you see that he or she knows all the roles in it, that you don't just keep running at you actually tag and then you run away and try not to be tagged again.

Speaker 3:          00:33:04       Who's it, who's nodded what the rules are. And they've gotten a lot more complicated. Kids aren't just playing tag. If you're at a playground, you'll hear him make up a lot of thematic play, pretend play around tag. They'll say like, if you touch the ground, it's lava and your blah, blah. And it's all these rules now that make it really complicated. So as you're, as you're playing games like this with your child, you want to start to make, put kind of themes around it, stories around it, make it more complicated in a, in a way that's manageable, predictable in their control. And B, again, being a good partner, making it really obvious what their role is and what your role is.

Speaker 3:          00:33:50       Um, making sure they feel in control doesn't mean they get control. Um, however, helping them manage this, uh, the scariness of it all and giving them a sense of control. So if they're, whatever they're motivated by, that's where we start when we're connecting with the child. And then we can add more things to it that maybe are not where they're motivated or maybe is it, is it is not a preferred activity. I can go in that direction. So as I work with kids, I, it's, it's, it's certainly child led. So it's third agenda. I had my goals and I never get rid of my goals, however, I start at their skill level, their interests, and then my steps to the goal is, is in that direction and it's constantly stretching and it's really layered learning cause I'm getting eye contact, I'm demonstrating what lots of Nice facial expression, nice tone of voice. Um, you know, whatever skill I'm working with, if it's a concept, if it's expanding on play and I'm getting loops of interaction. So it's not just me. Um, it's, it's not just me meeting needs, it's back and forth. I'm being really, and that's the whole sensory detective is responding to their body language. What is a child telling you? But especially around that nonverbal language. Um, so if a child pushes away, I'm about to tickle and they turn their body, I'll say, oh, done tickler, no tickle. And if they come back testicle Oh, more or whatever. Um, but I, I'm, I'm very responsive to body language and what that's telling me and I functional language to that body language.

Speaker 2:          00:35:40       Okay.

Speaker 3:          00:35:41       Um, the toys, again, not taking the toys away, not withholding. You'll see it later. You don't want to withhold items. If a child saying, you know, buck for banana, I can work in and go in the direction of the word banana, but I'm not going to withhold that banana until they say banana because I'm not a good partner here. I'm not user friendly. They're gonna walk away way before we get there. And so being responsive as being that user friendly partner.

Speaker 2:          00:36:10       Yeah.

Speaker 3:          00:36:11       Um, not to stop or interrupt, play when plays going on. We just want to keep expanding on it and expanding on it

Speaker 3:          00:36:19       and again knows we'll stop it. Uh, certain items being taken away, stop it being irresistible. The big expressions, you'd draw attention their face. These are the things to be socially successful. And with social success we see learners because they're observing. They read the situation and then they'll imitate. They'll learn from what they're seeing, the things we want them to imitate. Um, and, and they start to learn from their peers instead of having to be taught directly. And so we want, again, want to make it really obvious early on with the exaggerated expressions. Um, letting them see your face, pausing, exaggerating your movement, uh, the, if they're working on point or whatever else, make it really obvious what that looks like. I mean, again, you think it's no big deal, but you know, to learn to isolate this finger amongst all of the rest, it takes a lot of brain power. The messages have got to get through our bodies to isolate these motor movements in. Sure. We do it all the time. That if, if the messages aren't going through your, you know, from your, from through your body to the brain and then back in a timely manner, you're not seeing this.

Speaker 3:          00:37:36       And so you want to make it really obvious of what it looks like. Demonstrate it so that there's no question of what's expected. Um, sound draws a men even with bubbles, if I say, you know, oh,

Speaker 5:          00:37:49       bubbles pop,

Speaker 3:          00:37:52       stuff like that, right? If all I do is this, a child's not going to watch. I want to tracking, I want them invested in this activity. I want them making sounds cause some leads to language and what kids, young kids especially do is they put sound to play. And so getting all those sounds going in different ways, whether it's jumping on the bed or running around. And a lot of times for kids, if they don't have language, and I put sounds to it, they're able to initiate play with me with the sound because they don't, can't say, oh, I want you to do bubbles for me again. They'll just stay.

Speaker 5:          00:38:28       Oh. And I'll say [inaudible]

Speaker 3:          00:38:30       I give again, give back the functional word for it, but I accept the language they're able to give me at that moment

Speaker 3:          00:38:39       and make that activity much more fun with you than without you. And that means being manageable, predictable in their control. Because when you're not, it's not fun for them. You're taking away from um, their activity, the way they have to do it in that moment. Can we join exactly what they have to do and then I can stretch it. But if I go and just decide a child who is maybe spinning wheels and I go and say, oh, that's not how you play with car. Did you take the car and you go are, or even if I make it fun, it won't matter. This is where he is. He's mastered this. It fulfills him in some way. I need to respect that. And so I joined an exactly that and then I add to this, ah, you know, go fast or slow. I do some concept and I do the rule of three.

Speaker 3:          00:39:25       Would that beginning, middle and end. And I'll, you know, Gina's wheels, I got to go fast, ready, set, go, make it really obvious. And I go back to joining at his pace and the old guy, dude, his wheels are going again and I'll do that same way at least three times. And if he keeps looking, I know he's interested and then I want more out of him. What I really wanted to imitation with a little boy, I'm actually thinking of, he didn't give me a mutation, so I went back to joining. He kept looking over and I do, I'm still here and I would just keep doing this. And finally he said, Ma. And he didn't have language. He had a pro, a few proximation sets it and lots of sensory issues, low body tone. And so on my own, I'm actually on my stomach to be lower than him and I'm doing exactly what he's doing.

Speaker 3:          00:40:17       And so I give him exactly what he wants. Um, but only when he gives me something I don't keep giving. And then I go back to this and then he looks up at me, does it get more? And, and after a couple of times like that, I start to decrease my party and give more words. He'll say, if more. And I said, well, you're really like fast. Okay, here's more asbestosis pass. Then I give them more. And at some point I did prompt them. And this is only, you know, really within minutes this was happening. First Time meeting him and I say Johnny do fast and he's doing this and it was really at the same pace but a preemptive strike. I say good, fast, fast, fast, fast, fast, fast, fast. And he started doing fast and then that same, it was a two hour session. Within that same tour session, we ran fast, we jumped fast. So we took the concept of fast and we did it in multiple activities for mastery. And then at some point we added slow to activities where they were appropriate. You don't want it to be, I still make it fun. And so if I do slow for certain things, it's not so much fun. Um, so that he could start discriminating between these things.

Speaker 2:          00:41:33       Um, be

Speaker 3:          00:41:33       responsive. That's that. Thanking him. Everything you want to see out of a child, you want it to be clear what's expected. We can put that in our response, our thank you's and vary your language. Again, make it fun. You want to keep that, that value to it. So if I say, oh, thank you for cleaning up. Oh, thank you for eating. Oh, thank you for sharing. I'm going to be specific and say exactly when I see more often because if a child gives me something, I say thank you. I can assume he knows, but I don't want to assume I want to. What I'm really saying is do that more often. Just like the kid who really didn't do fast, but I said good fast, right? I'm telling him it's fast before it is, but what I'm really saying is faster, faster, more, more, more.

Speaker 3:          00:42:23       But I'm building that confidence and I'm showing that we're a team in this and so I can say thank you with good energy and be specific, but it loses its value after awhile. Sick. Thank you all the time, kind of boring. And you want to keep that value in that kind of connection and doing things like, oh, there's those pretty eyes. Get excited about that stuff. It also brings more energy as you're doing these, you know, when you think how long do I do the eye thing? Shouldn't he be giving me eye contact by now if he's not, we keep reinforcing it. Um, and we keep the party hi when needed. It's like when a child first starts walking, right, we get really excited, you can do it. And we were kind of that big cheerleader there and now that they have own walking, we don't have to say anything more about it. We move on from those things. But we have to be that cheerleader in that development of whatever skill you're looking at. And you know, the thing about eye contact is cause there's a lot of kids who don't have to look to take the information in. However, at some point they're going to be missing the more complicated stuff because they're not watching. So we do need eye contact. Um, you know, we want the, certainly that receptive language that follows it was very, very important. Um, but I'd hold them to the eye contact as well.

Speaker 3:          00:43:47       So finding teachable moments. Those are just kind of some ideas. I'm going to move on for this just to get to the next slide. Um, model functional language. Again, be that good audience. The more you receive communication was verbal or nonverbal, especially the nonverbal to say back things even, but she child looks a little nervous about something. I know it's a little scary, but I'm going to help you. You could do it or hating haircuts, hating to get their hair washed, brushing teeth or whatever. I know you don't like it. It's okay. We can do it. And you kind of let them know first. You know, first, you know, top teeth [inaudible] Tepe than all down or something. I'll do the washing hair and I'll say like, you know, five cups of water and then all done. So I let them know, I estimate what it's going to take and then I, I get it through and it's not fun for the child.

Speaker 3:          00:44:44       However they survive it. And for some things, that's what we're doing. We don't want to tip tool around, you know, it's anxiety provoking activities or, or, or scary activities. We want to help them through it. We want to be a partner and say, no, it's a little scary, but when you think help you, we would do it together and then we give them some success and then we move on to the next. We don't have to spend again a lot of time explaining why they had to do it. We just want to help them be successful and that in any given activity. Um, and, and what happens too is over time it gets easier and easier, do less for the child, um, to create openings. And again, I, it, it, especially for help of a child needs help. And it's obvious to me, I am available and I'll put my hands out and say, I'm right here.

Speaker 3:          00:45:40       If you want help and I'll punch out whatever word they should be saying, but I don't automatically do. You know, I, I um, right there, it's, I'm anticipating them giving me something or asking me for help, but they do have to give to get. And so for kids who don't have language, they might put the item in my hand, I'll say yes, help, help. And I help for other kids, they might give me language to help or for some I'm ready but they want to work on a little longer and I might get a little reinforcement for that. And so your work, you're really hard things, you know, again, just reinforcing the actions they are demonstrating to me with functional language, but keeping it really simple, no matter how much it language a child has, I do a lot more gestures than expansive language.

Speaker 2:          00:46:29       Okay.

Speaker 3:          00:46:30       Um, pause often you've seen me do that. Um, it allows a child to give, to get, it also allows them to read the situation because at some point you want to be yells at Johnny and he looks at it

Speaker 3:          00:46:46       and for follow through with things like that. That's much more compliment, complicate that made us say, Johnny, come over here, have a seat. I mean that's all first teach it, but across the room you want to be able to go like this. That's a more subtle, a social language that we all have to read. Um, demonstrate nice social emotional language and problem solving skills. You know, it's really important for a child early on to have social emotional language. And so we do, we teach that by giving it to them. I know it's a little scary or oh, that you know that they're sad or whatever and be that yourself. You don't always want to do things perfectly. Have accidents. All have a little water and a cup. And I'll purposely, it spilled for it depending on the child and working at La. Oh well I'll clean it up.

Speaker 3:          00:47:35       Right? Accidents happen. But for some kids, you know, their social emotional responses over the top. And so you want to have a little bit of a reaction, uh, but then a problem solve the problem. You don't always want to go to solving the problem and you think about it in your own life. If you came home to your partner and said, oh, traffic was so bad, I can't stand one on one, it's always packed. And they're like, oh, why don't you take one on one every time I tell you to go blah instead of one on one. You don't want a pro, you don't want solution to that problem. You're aggravate it and you want someone to meet you there and the aggravation and then you can let it go. But if someone's always solving your problems, you're not going to really talk to them about problems so much.

Speaker 3:          00:48:21       Right? You just want to be matched and then you can come down. And so even for kids who do have big responses, I guess you all have experienced this before. I'll match them in that, but then I can bring him down. Like if it's frustration, I know it's so frustrating. Hey, I have an idea, try this. Right? But if I don't match them there, then I, I typically can't lead them out of there. So, again, depending on what your work on. Um, so have your own accidents. Try something and make it not work. You know, doing household, uh, you know, fixing things around your house. Kids love to try to do screwdrivers or whatever. Act like you can't do it and asked for their help and make it really simpler. Opening a water bottle, you know, I'll purposely have it loose. Can you, you know, and I'll ask for them to help me. And then they're able love when you helped me write it, well, I already loosened it up. It's still, um, I make it so that I can't solve everything. I can't do everything. And so that they can step into, we all need those moments. Pair gestures with your words, visuals, you know, gestures are so important. And so if you're not an expressive person, you want to turn it on for those moments.

Speaker 3:          00:49:40       Be Mindful teacher. You want to think about what you're teaching and promote that, especially imitation through demonstration. When we look at imitation, I don't think that's an it, but we're looking at facial, um, Volkl gestural action with objects. Um, so you want to, and you want to think about how they're doing, you know, as, as your child is developing at language, is there a nice tone of voice? Are they owning that language? Uh, you know, they are, they able to not only read, come here, but they too will do come here. And you can especially teach that when there's a couple of you. I, you know, daddy come here. Well you have to show him, go do this and you can even do a little here and I'll help you. And you do come here Daddy. And then, yeah. And then Daddy, oh, thanks for showing me.

Speaker 3:          00:50:30       So again, you thank him for whatever you want the, the skill to improve on. So if language is already there and you went, the gestural reinforced that gesture by the showing, make expectations clear, have that beginning, middle, and end to everything you're teaching and stick with it for a few rounds until they're able to read it. It's a couple for some kids, it's getting them to buy in, making it fun. And I have to sell that fun. And so I keep doing it that same way and that makes it really clear what it looks like. And for some other kids it's important for them to observe it multiple times so they know what their role is. If I want a child to do fast, what does it look like? What does it sound like? I'm defining that word even as I say it, right? Fast test, test, test, test.

Speaker 3:          00:51:19       And probably my speed isn't like really fast. It may not even change that much, but I'm calling it fast and um, the way I'm saying it's fast and so I'm selling the fast concept. Um, and so it's really important to make those expectations. I know you've seen that on a few slides already, but we want them to step up, make sure it's clear, um, and to support the follow through. So the same little boy, he would have a bag and I would ask him to, heavy work is really good for a kid. Most kids too. Um, and so I would have him bring the bag inside and he would take the bag, but he would take a couple steps and Linda kind of slip off his arm and I do a playful and obstruction and say, wait, you know, to the door, but I already made the expectation clear, you know, to bring it to the door.

Speaker 3:          00:52:08       So whether it's groceries or whatever, where do they have to carry it to, to the table, to the door, whatever, have it very clear. And so I put it back on his arm and I actually would held this arm up and said, you know, I'll help you. And we go to the door with it. And I said, good, you know, good caring or good listening. Um, and then he started to do an himself after a couple times of me holding it to them cause I didn't, I couldn't, it wasn't an activity that I could in that short amount of time repeat over and over. He was getting there and I just was having it carry to the door. So after a few visits of that, he knew that I was going to hold them to it and he started doing it himself. Um, if needed, allow for sensory input break.

Speaker 3:          00:52:54       So if a kid's doing homework or whatever, and you see them moving a little more good, put language shoe that, oh, I know us, you're moving in your seat, or your, your work's getting sloppy. How about we jump three times and then try again? You know, or, um, a, but don't let them go watch TV or do something that they're not coming back from. It's that sensory input. It's that movement. You know, an article came out a few years ago now and it was research showing that kids who sit on a bouncy ball are more successful, um, in school, get higher grades, doing homework on a bouncy ball. And so having that movement can really help with focus, work and be animated. You've seen that and there's your summary. So, sorry if I sped through that last part, but it's to get to questions. Oh, I should just go right. Oh, there's some resources at the end, by the way, including all these resources. You can additionally get through a spa. And these Yahoo chat groups for parents only, they vet it. Well it's parents only. You do not have to be on the peninsula or Kaiser parents from all over. Different insurances are in both and they're strong advocate parents who run those groups.

Speaker 1:          00:54:12       Okay. Um, we do have some time for questions and um, we'll take audience questions first and we do have a microphone that will pass around for those questions. The audience questions.

Speaker 3:          00:54:30       Okay. Too much information over. I'll go to the dory.

Speaker 2:          00:54:34       Thank you.

Speaker 1:          00:54:38       Okay. So the first question on the Dory is what would you recommend as effective methods for disciplining children with autism?

Speaker 3:          00:54:46       You know, it depends on the child. Certainly. Um, you want to teach and get tilos yes. Sides as much as possible. And so certainly, uh, you know, for some kids, timeout works given a break. Well, you know, but having them try again is very, very important. So if it's a child who pulls hair, you know, I used to run a center based program and we had a little boy who would really want it to play with these other kids and he'd pull the little girl's hair. And so teaching gentle hands, oh you can say hi, you can pat. And so we were right there at teach what he could do, um, with his hands to get that interaction that we knew he wanted it. So you know, what is the purpose of that behavior and then looking for the replacements, what are the yes in those, because the know is pulling hair, explaining that to a child, why they can't pull hair and then the friend won't want to play with them. And all of this, for most kids that's not going to teach what should I do? And so teaching the, what should they do? If you do a time out, you know, you can say, okay, we're going to, we're going to take a break and then try again. Give them that opportunity to try it again if it's at home, but then help them be successful as they try it again.

Speaker 1:          00:56:08       He went. Other Tory question. Um, are there any resources that you would recommend for parents of older children who may not have the skill sets initially to live on their own? Specifically about job life skill training and resources as well as possible options such as group homes or assisted living for adult?

Speaker 3:          00:56:28       Um, so if you haven't contacted the bay autism center in San Francisco, run by, um, Jill Escher and she does a lot of workshops as well or um, sh Jill usher is really is putting a lot of time and effort resources into uh, older children, individuals. You can also call [inaudible] an s book and give you a lot more resources. If you want anything specific, they can, um, give you contacts and you know, any information around groups and all of that. Um, there's a lot of apps out there that I know are being used. Again, if you call s she can kind of go over some of those, uh, for work stuff

Speaker 2:          00:57:20       as well.

Speaker 1:          00:57:21       Okay. Any other audience questions before we end?

Speaker 2:          00:57:25       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:57:26       Your microphone's coming to you.

Speaker 2:          00:57:32       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:57:32       Um, do you have any suggestions if your child is a extremely food limiting as far as their choices, as far as things to kind of get them to open up to, uh, to new foods and things?

Speaker 3:          00:57:43       Uh, so that is certainly a hard one because we get so scared of our kids not eating that we many times will give over. I mean, and I know the specialists out there that, that work with food issues have long wait list. Um, but a lot of, and certainly you can call Espa and Christina can give you some information and contact you with other people. Um, there'd be no cost to it. Well, we, we recently did a four s ba I did, I do parent groups as well. If you ever want information on that, they're free to attend and you can do remote and in person. And one was on food. And one of the tips that this specialist gay, which I thought was really interesting is if your child say, is eating bread, well you want to add just one thing that compliments bread that you think will be acceptable, like butter. You don't want it then say, okay, here's spinach, right? Whatever they are eating, you want something that actually goes with that item to just get a different taste on the Palette, to just stretch them up, different texture, different flavor, um, that would be acceptable for them to try. Um, but if you, if you, um, I don't know if my email's on here, I can send you the presentation. This individual did that Hella nice tips in that too. I'll give you an email with really,

Speaker 1:          00:59:14       do you have any recommendation for when the kids start to act a silly, especially in they're comfortable with the situation.

Speaker 3:          00:59:22       Start like acting very silly, very, very silly. And a lot of that is, uh, uh, you know, some underlying anxiety. We see that as, or even being overstimulated. So deep pressure helps with that. I would put language to it, say, you know, start to help them discriminate when that's appropriate, when not, if it doesn't feel like a connection, it probably is overstimulation, right? So depending on where you are, sometimes holding a some item that they can give pressure squeeze, you know, those balls or whatever. Um, you know, we used to put a weight, the, the avoid the ankle weights. You open those up and put it on a child's lap and that will ground them a little bit. Their feet should always be touching the ground to be grounded. If they're sitting in your chair, you don't want their feet dangling because then they'd have no way of grounding themselves and they can kind of start to get out of control.

Speaker 3:          01:00:21       Um, if it's somewhere where you're sitting and you can put them on their lap and give him some deep pressure that can help, uh, just that PR, even weight pressure on the shoulders to relax their body and ground them, but you want to hold and kind of affirm hold and with, uh, not that grabbed squeeze consequence that can work them up even higher. But just that like squeeze and hold and I, I will, I won't break contact and I will do the rule of three. So if I'm given a hug or something, right for a child, they'll say, ah, and there's my beginning, you know, hug and I get this nice deep hug and then I will let up, but I don't break contact and I'll do it the rule of three and I do it again and then I'll open up and some kids will push back into me, I'll say more ugh.

Speaker 3:          01:01:10       And it's just to relax their body. Um, so that then we can have more focused work or they can move on to something else. Deep squeezes in the hand really help. And I mean, I get nice from school yet, and again, I'll say she's queen. And so that's where time where I won't be, you know, when we, when we talk about bringing that energy, it's not being obnoxious, right? Cause I can do it with no words are, but for a child who's kind of overstimulate, then yes, it's kind of lowering it and giving that deep pressure, you know, kind of a whisper and con, let's try squeeze is, and I'm always just trying. I don't know what's going to work. I'm taking best guests and squeeze, and then I'm just relaxing their body and then we try again. Whatever situation is okay, now let's try to watch, you know, focus or whatever it is. And I'll use the word focus quite a bit because we want focus during certain activities. Yeah. Okay. Thank you so much. You want to thank you for attending.
