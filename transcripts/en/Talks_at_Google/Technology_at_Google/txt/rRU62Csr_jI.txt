Speaker 1:          00:00:06       Help me. Welcome Morning Neil.

Speaker 1:          00:00:15       Mona and I are childhood rails. We've known each other since the last century and we are actually grown together ever since. And we've been collaborating together when we were children, when we used to talk a lot and we'll use the like enjoying nature and talking about other animal species. And we also like to compare our perception of reality. Uh, so we were always talking about uh, what it would be like 2 cents, uh, things that we can send, what it would be like to be an aunt or what would it be like to be another species. So we used to talk a lot about nature more than science fiction or, or technology. We were more into nature and other species. And what we also compared a lot was vision. Cause I, I was born completely colorblind so I've never seen color, I've never seen blue, yellow, pink. I have acromegaly.

Speaker 1:          00:01:01       Awesome. Which is total color blindness. So that's something that was very different between us, that I would see things in gray scale and she would see colors, she would see things that I wouldn't say. So we were at the same species. What we had different perception of reality to me seeing in gray scale was fine. I enjoy seeing in gray scale cause I see better at night vision. So at night I would see better than moon, but during the day she would say things that I wouldn't see. Also I see longer distances because if you don't see color you can see longer. The senators and I memorized the shapes more easily because color, it doesn't distract me but I couldn't ignore the existence of color because color has mentioned every single day. Uh, like in elements that are things that are very common like Bluetooth, Greenpeace, Red Cross, uh, yellow pages, pink pants, the green card, James Brown is his last name and also these huge country called green land as well.

Speaker 1:          00:01:50       So I kept hearing the names of colors and I couldn't ignore the existence of it. Also when you use a tap water, like hot water and cold water, sometimes there's only a color code or maps, this is fine. But if I go to Tokyo I can get easily lost cause some maps only use color codes. And then when I was at school learning flags, I had this situation where three countries share exactly the same flag. And if someone asks me, have you seen a man with ginger hair, blue eyes and dressed in pink, I would have absolutely no idea. I've, I've seen this man because the only information I get, here's the demand has hair that he has eyes and that he's not naked. So the reason why I wanted to sense color was not because of the beauty of color, but because of the social aspect of it that it's common use.

Speaker 1:          00:02:35       Very, very used. I decided I would study music cause I thought music will not have color and I wanted to focus my life on the piano of black and white instrument. I thought that will be a black and white world. But when I was playing music I realized there's many theories really then coloring and sound as well. Newton did this theory centuries ago and after him there's been many more. There's many theories that relate color with sound and actually true. They both frequency colors or light frequency and stone is an audio frequency. So in 2003 when I was telling music composition, I started the project with Alan Mountain done in order to create a third eye that would allow me to hear the actual frequencies of light. So if we had some kind of third eye that would allow us to sense the vibrations of color, but instead of seeing that we would hear them, we would hear a note for each color.

Speaker 1:          00:03:23       Because red for example, is around 430 millions of millions of waves per second. So that's a note, a musical note that we can't hear because it's too high and it's a different type of frequency. But if we could hear that frequency would hear a note betweenF and f sharp. So the aim was to create a software that would scale down the light frequencies to audible frequencies to that I would be able to hear colors. So the first prototype was a webcam connected the five killer computer and a pair of headphones that was scaling down the frequencies of light to audible frequencies. So I was able to hear a note for each color and I memorize the names that you give to each color. And I had this for several months until I memorized all in the visual colors. And this allowed me to hear a note for each degree of the color wheel.

Speaker 1:          00:04:03       That's 360 microphones in an awkward [inaudible] sine waves. So very pure waves. Now we here in shades of orange going up two shades of orange, yellow and the yellow. So it's very, very micro Dono. It took me three years to memorize all of these microphones and the names that you would give to all these colors. And then there's, I'll call it also has another or thing which is saturation. So we have the different levels of saturation depending on the saturation level. So it's very loud. It means it's very saturated and if it's a low, it's a soft color. And then, um, I was, uh, I didn't play the piano anymore. I started painting pianos cause to me color became my musical instruments. So I was painting colors on top of the piano. Now I was amplifying the sound of the colors to the audience. And that was piano concerts.

Speaker 1:          00:04:49       And my final music composition of portfolio was not a score but the different paintings. So to me each color is a note. So I can compose music by painting different colors on us on a piece of paper. When I was able to sense all the visual colors, I didn't see why I should stop there cause there's many other species because inside science scholars that we can not sense like infrared and ultraviolet. So in 2007 2008 I decided to extend my perception of color to near infrared, the near ultraviolet. So since then I can send some more colors in the visual spectrum. And this means that I can continuously extend my perception of color beyond the visual spectrum cause through sound you can hear much more than through the ice. So that allows me to perceive colors that are not only visible to me but invisible to other humans.

Speaker 1:          00:05:31       But they're visible for other or perceptive perceptive for other animal species. The Mr continuously extend the perception of color. The other aim was not to use or where technology I went through to become technology. I didn't want to have a wearable device. I wanted to have a new sensory organ first. I've thought of having a third eye implanted in the middle of my head, but that would only limit my perception of color to what is in front of me. So then I looked at nature and I saw there's many species that have antenna. So I thought that the best option would have would be to have a new sensory organ, an antenna implanted in my head that would allow me to perceive colors through vibrations in my bone instead of using my ears vibrations inside my bone, that then would become sounds to my inner ear.

Speaker 1:          00:06:14       So I looked at nature. So there's many types of antennas. The one I was more interested in was the same fascist type of antenna, more circular. So it would allow me to send scholars 360 degrees because I couldn't turn the antenna around so I can send scholars behind me or beside me without being connected to my site. And then when the antenna was design, I looked and tried to find a doctor willing to do the surgery and I said, [inaudible] is an antenna implant as such, sorry, we don't do this here. Within the antenna implants, you'll have to talk to a bioethical committee. So I propose the surgery to a biosimilar committee and then they said no, that this is not ethical because a doctor's only regenerate preexisting sensors or they regenerate preexisting body parts, but creating a new sense of color that goes beyond the spectrum was not ethical.

Speaker 1:          00:07:02       And also having a new Oregon was not ethical. So I tried to find a doctor willing to do the surgery anonymously and I found one and then we did it on a Monday, his day off. And then we rented the room and he did the surgery there. So that's my head facing down. We reduce, we removed some hair, we reduced the skin and my head was drilled four times different implants. One is for the chip that vibrates inside my head to other implants or the structure of the antenna and we decided to add a fourth implant, which is Internet connection so that I can then receive colors from other parts of the world. Not only the antenna, but people can also send colors to my head, arcane connect to external devices. So it took two months for the antenna in my head to merge. So now the angina is part of my skeleton, so if someone pulls down there, it's impossible to remove it because it's inside my bone and I had to get used to my new height.

Speaker 1:          00:07:53       I'm officially taller now, Internet connection. I have five people in the world that have permission to send colors through my head. They can do it through their mobile phones so they can stream live images directly to my head. So if there's a beautiful sunset in Australia now someone in Melbourne can actually use the mobile phone to stream the live images of the sunset to my head. So I could be here, but sensing the colors of a sunset or if someone sends me colors at night, then they can actually influence my dreams. So if I wake up and I realized I dreamt the violet people and violent houses, it's probably because someone was sending me violet colors at night so my friends can actually color my dreams or they can change the way I drink because of the college they sentence. So we using the internet as a sense here.

Speaker 1:          00:08:33       So the Internet is not being used as a tool or a communication tool is more of a way of sharing a sense in this case, sharing color perception. And also it's a way of extending my senses beyond my body. My brain has changed as an Mri of my brain. Doctors cannot tell what, uh, what is happening to my rent. They don't know if I'm looking at an image or hearing a sound cause my brain reacts in the same way. Both the visual and the audio cortex are always active. So I feel I'm a cyborg cause I feel that there's no wall between the sophomore and my brain. I felt my brain and the software have United and given me this new sense. So I identify as a Cyborg, as a biological cyborg cause I feel United to cybernetics. Cyborg comes from the union between cybernetics and organism.

Speaker 1:          00:09:17       And that's why I tried to explain to the Yukon government in 2004, because they didn't allow me to renew my passport because they said that there was some kind of electronic equipment or the picture. And as this law that says electronic agreement does not allow them passport photos. So I told them that this is a body part. And then I told them that I felt that I was a Cyborg, a union between cybernetics and an organism. And in the end they allowed me the appear and the password is 2004 with this first prototype. And this allows me to travel freely around the world. Cause airports don't usually like technology. So if you are technology they don't like you very much. So this is part of um, uh, uh, important to have it in the passport. Now I'm applying for Swedish citizenship because of the material in my head is Swedish.

Speaker 1:          00:09:57       So my body parts of my body is Swedish. So I'm telling them that, uh, I should also be allowed to apply for Swedish citizenship. So I'm still in conversations with the Swedish government. Hopefully they'll say yes, and if they see as, I guess each country might have different laws saying that if you have a body part that is from the UK, maybe you need to have it for seven years and then after seven years you can apply for British citizenship. We've had the body part that is British and maybe the u s might be longer, maybe 10. I don't know. We'll see. So hopefully we'll have, I'll have a reply soon.

Speaker 2:          00:10:32       Yeah. So I, as I grew up with Neil, I could, uh, go with Cayman experience all his developments and there was appointed, he was actually better in perceiving the nine, so he extent the precession of color. So I kind of got jealous and I wondered also to extend my perception of something. And I was studying dance and I'm a choreographer, so I'm very interested in movement. I in and I wanted to perceive movement in a deeper way. And I knew that using technology to do that would help me because of that. So I, I thought, what, how could I perceive movement? Like what sense of movement can we have as that humans don't have? And the first thing is, I thought this was that, um, we can, we don't have the sense of a speed by ourselves. So I use this, uh, I mean like, uh, this kind of glove and I would point of people.

Speaker 2:          00:11:23       And then when people were, uh, were walking in front of the glove, I could know the speed of the people walking in front of me and then, um, was not that useful because I had to point and people, and then, uh, that gave me any information and I didn't want to have inflammation. I wanted to have a sense, like a feeling of speed. So, uh, the next step was to grow the tens, phone these into any rings. So every time that someone was walking from right, the lever would feel a regression on my right ear. And then on my left here, and then depending of the vibration of the interval of each way ration, I wouldn't know the spate of the people walking in front of me. So then I would, uh, if I, I had these for a long time and then with my ass clothes it would be able to know and what, um, uh, what speed the people was walking in front of me.

Speaker 2:          00:12:10       So it was like a sense and then I'd be aeration. And then after wearing these for some, some time, like just focusing on the, on the speed, the hat in front, one day I realized that maybe it could turn the yearnings around and then these open a whole, um, a whole space awareness of myself. So suddenly, because I could already see movement with my eyes in front of me, but in the back of our body that I feel that our sense is a very, we don't have many senses. It's like very close sensory, but the bags of our bodies. So these open a whole space and I could feel presence behind me. So every time someone was working was working towards me, I could feel presence. Who would they be relations, uh, on my years then I'm, I was perceiving these movement all around me through, through the probation to the people and objects.

Speaker 2:          00:13:00       And there was a point that, um, I, I don't want that. The, my movement perception depends on people or objects around me. So I thought that I needed to perceive from movement and live with me more universal that didn't come from people or objects that I could be alone in the Bryant and you still feel movement. And then I realized that not only humans move, there are many things and move all around us and in many different ways. And the planet itself is constantly moving and not only rotates by itself and around the, and the sand, but it, it moves constantly and shakes constantly through earthquakes. And earthquake is a massive movement that most of the times we don't feel it. And I thought it would be fascinated to transforms to them's from this massive movement to, to one body. And so now I thought that it could perceive the earthquakes of the year through my body.

Speaker 2:          00:13:54       And then now I have, uh, an implant in my arm. The Bib rates, every time there's an earthquake anywhere in the planet. So depending of the intensity of earthquake there, we ration, I feel in my arm is a stronger, uh, lower, and I call these the size. Makes Sense. Um, yes. Uh, that will be, and then the, and then when we do like, we see these Neil distension of the news Nealon diversities as an art. So the, the artwork of a cyborg artist would be the creation of a new sense. Um, the, so my artwork would be the seismic sense and meals are what would be the internet per se, this new sense that he goes to sooner dramatic sense, but it's a sense of what happens inside our own body. So we are the only audience of our own art. So in order to share our experience, we create external artwork. Um, yeah, there's always external. How rude, like the reveals our experience of reality. So

Speaker 1:          00:14:51       cyborg art is like taking a picture. When you take a picture, the art of taking a picture is one thing. And then the art of developing the film is that another part you can either just take the picture and that could be art that only experience the photographer. Or you can choose to develop this film and share this with other people. So in the case of Cyborg art, it's the same. We are experiencing our own art, which is the experience of this new sense. And then we decide to reveal these experience through external odd words. Or by the way we, we live also mean my case before I would dress in a way that it would look good. Now I dress in a way that it sounds good to me. So I decide which notes I want to wear. If I wear this color combination, I, I'm dressed in c major, so I, I'm, I'm wearing a major chord.

Speaker 1:          00:15:36       So I would dress like this in happy occasions. This is a minor chord. I would dress like this, didn't funerals. So that's a a sad court or I can also wear songs. So I'm designing clothes with a friend so that can wear specific melodies. This is a tie that sounds like electronic music. So I really liked a piece of electronic music. The tie, if I listened to it, I hear the electronic music. So the longer the title longer the melody, you can choose how long you wanted. Also, the way I, I see houses has changed now. My living room for example, is painted in c major, pink, blue and yellow. So then when I go inside, it's major chord. The floor is all red because red is the lowest frequency. So it's the lowest sound. So it gives a profound sound to the whole house.

Speaker 1:          00:16:17       Then the exit door is, um, is um, green because green is in the middle of the spectrum. So it gives a, it's like a tuning fork before you go outside. The ceilings are black and white because it's silent. So if I lie down and it's all silent, uh, then the kitchen is a, I'm not, my bedroom has three colors. It's a turquoise, pink and violet. So it's the notes are beat, eat and the bat. So it makes sense for me to happen these three colors in the bedroom. And then in the, in the kitchen it's violet. Violet is the highest page, so it gives, it's uh, keeps me alert. So it's a color that we don't usually eat. So it doesn't interfere with food. Food has changed a lot as well because when I eat, I hear different notes. So I can actually compose music with foot depending on how I put the food on the plate.

Speaker 1:          00:17:04       I can eat songs and I'm collaborating with a restaurant in Barcelona where we are, uh, there's a, a new plate, uh, chroma phone. Why you put the food on top and then you rotate the plate and then you can hear the foot. So you can go to the restaurant and asked for some music. You're going to ask for Mozart and then they serve you the different colors. And then you turn around and you hear Mozart piece. Or you can ask for some lady Gaga Dessert and then you can hear some lady Gaga Dessert. So, uh, this was actually presented the three days ago in San Francisco and we're doing some experimental Sonequa romantic dinners where people eat different songs. So now I can compose music as well by looking at things. Instead of playing an instrument, I can just look at different colors and then I hear the music in my head.

Speaker 1:          00:17:44       And then I can choose to also share this experience by amplifying the sounds of my head to the audience. So then the color countries, I use bone bone conducted headphones or Bluetooth to amplify the sounds of my head to the audience. And then I can play different types of food. Are Objects. Also my experience of walking around the supermarket has changed a lot because there's lots of colors there. So there's lots of music, especially the aisles with cleaning products. And that is the most exciting. I love a supermarket because it has very, very loud and unexpected colors and it's usually very poppy, uh, pop music. Their milk is silent. So what elements and black alums? I completely silent. It's not only supermarkets is also art now going listen to a Picasso. I can listen to an Andy Warhol. All painters have become composers. So my experience of walking around the moment is like a music experience.

Speaker 1:          00:18:32       I can listen to different melodies and also each composer oil. Each painters sounds different. I can hear the scream. For example, an Andy Warhol for example, sounds very loud cause it's very saturated. So you can hear an Andy Warhol from the other end of the museum usually because it's very loud. Whereas all the pain things sound less because they're less has saturated. The way I send people as well has changed because when I look at someone, I hear their face and what I like doing is instead of drying their face, I write down the notes of people's faces, like the sound of the eyes, the lips of the skin, the hair, and then I send them an MP three of their face. So they thinking like I'm hearing those now. The first one was [inaudible]. I asked Prince Charles if I could listen to his face and this was his reaction when I asked him.

Speaker 1:          00:19:11       Each person. It sounds different. Judi Dench has silent hair like a glass of milk, so she has this very silent, uh, uh, James Cameron has very loud skin high-pitch shade of skin. Al Gore has different notes in his eyes, different shades of Turquoise. So different nodes in each eye. Tim Berners Lee has a very odd sound of eyelid, so his eyelids sound very unusual. Marina Abramovic is very silent, uh, almost a silent all her, but the lips are very loud and very low. Uh, Steve Wozniak, Zeiss, I'm like green apples. So very bureau as well. Moby sounds very little. She is one note missing. No hair. So he has less knowledge than other people. We're the island. Sounded like an old painting. Very unsaturated. Metallica lugging, see major, a major chord. It's unusual to find major courts where the Phillip glass sounds very [inaudible], very similar to his music and Bono at very, very loud glasses.

Speaker 1:          00:20:04       In this case he's got his where violet and very saturated. If you wear makeup, then you sound very different. Uh, if, if you went to hear your face, you would not use red lipstick, you would use green lipstick because the sound of green sounds very good with the skin. So, uh, if we would hear color, most people would wear green lipstick and then some blue here. Cause then it sounds see major or you have f sharp major in the face that you didn't like it. No. And then what really surprises me is that people who say they're black, they're not black. And people who say they're white, they're not white, people will say they're black, they're very, very dark orange. And they book will say that why they are very, very light orange. So the fact that people say that humans are black and white, it is completely false. We are all different shades of orange, very, ours are very dark orange. This is a color wheel and there's a reddish orange or yellowish orange. And then there's different

Speaker 3:          00:20:53       shades of light. I can also do face concerts where instead of playing the objects of colors, I played the audience's colors. So I, I look at the faces. The audience is the onion skews in that and start creating rhythms with the sound of the eyes, the hair, the lips of the audience. And I create layers of sound. So it's electronic music created by, by the colors of the others. If the concert sounds really bad, it's their fault because that's where the music comes from.

Speaker 1:          00:21:21       Uh, the last face concert was of Prince Albert, the second of Monaco. He liked the sound of his face so much that he's using it as his ringtone. So when people call him, here's his face. The secondary effect of hearing colors that sounds also become colors. So if I hear the line, uh, telephone line for me is green. Mostly it creates the, the frequency of green. And I can also play music. This is Mozart's queen of the night. Note by note from the center to the end. This is also music, this baby baby by Justin Bieber from the first book to the last. Also when we speak, use different frequencies. So I can transpose speeches into color. One of them is Martin Luther King's I have a dream speech. And the other one is a speech by Hitler. They look very different because they used very different types of frequencies when they spoke.

Speaker 1:          00:22:07       Also colors I use now with musicians. So music has learned the sound of color and then they have the concert colors are projected on stage and that's the score. So they play the colors of that projected in the, on the, on the stage. And also there's a public sculptures that use the sauna chromatic scale as well. So in this case, this is a song you can download an app on your mobile phone and then you walk underneath the sculpture and then you can listen to a melody. And at night it changes color. So you can actually hear music by pointing your phone at the sculpture that keeps changing colors. Uh, the reaction that people I've had with people through the years has changed. I've the fact of having an Antinomians people stop me everyday since 2004 and they asked me what it is or they, they just laugh and they leave.

Speaker 1:          00:22:51       Uh, the thing is that it's changing. In 2004, many people thought it was a reading light that I had some kind of uh, that it would turn on and they asked me, can you turn the light on? And it's not the light. So they thought it was a reading light in 2005, six, I thought it was a microphone for Internet chat in 2007 they thought it was a Bluetooth phone, like a taxi drivers started having hands free phone. So therefore thought it was some kind of phoning. 2009 people thought it was something to do with Gopro that I was filming my life in 2012, uh, people started to think it was something to do with Google, Google glass. It was sometime connected in 2014 15 they thought it was, well children asked me if it was some kind of expendable selfie stick that and not lately for the last three, three months, people point at me and they say Pokemon. They thought it, I think Pokemon, they tried to catch me sometimes. So it keeps changing. What people think it is. Hopefully in the 2010 people will just think is an antenna and as a new sensory organ, but it's still not happening.

Speaker 2:          00:23:53       Yeah. There's one, one way of the shine is also like we created this siren sculptures. One is like the three d version of my arm and the other one is like the immersion of Neil's head and it was exhibited in Barcelona and my arm would uh, would be connected to the online seismograms like my own arm and people were able to touch it. Then whenever there isn't and there was an earthquake, they could fill it and we're going to like say, well this culture it goes, it's a say a sculpture. Can I get to a living organism? In Micah is was the earth and in Neal's case it was connected actually to Neil's head.

Speaker 1:          00:24:25       Yeah. So people in the gallery, they could send colors to my head life. So one of the five connection in the world for six months, it was the sculpture in the museum so I can receive in college from visitors of the museum. It was overwhelming because there were schools there as well. So they were sending lots of colors, have blood every day.

Speaker 2:          00:24:43       Am I one of my ways to share and sell? So the way in a performance and it's called waiting for earthquakes was standstill on a place and then a wait for an earthquake to take place, which is very often and whatever happens, I move according to the intensity of the earthquake. So it's a durational business and have big 89 and it can last 10 minutes. I can last hours. And it's just a, it's like a dual between the earth and myself live the earth is like the choreographer of the piece and I'm Josie t interpretating the real data that is coming through, it's like an invitation to the audience just to, to listen for a while the, the, the natural movement of the earth. And also wanted to say that, um, when the first time I had to, ah, there's the seismic sensor at the beginning, I had to get used to fill this with patients every day.

Speaker 2:          00:25:34       And maybe if there was a big one in the middle of the night, I would wake up. But at the end, like now more yesterday and, and now it feels like having two heartbeats, like I have my own and then this constant aeration, mim and I, it's like, I mean, yeah, to be, it's like the earth, the earth beat and then my heartbeat, like at the same time. And also though the space sometimes in different places in New York, I have these new skip and uh, suddenly I appeared somewhere in the street and a, and I have a paper explaining what I do. And this was, uh, I was in the middle of the night waiting in Times Square and some people lay down also. So it's like, it can be, it can be, it's a piece of, it can be anywhere because it just means standing there waiting for an earthquake. So yeah, like when, well, yeah, that's it.

Speaker 2:          00:26:29       And then, uh, my, uh, my other thing is that I do it with percussion and then we're going to show, so I can do seismic and I go like size my bird question. Whether earth in this case would be like the composer of the, I can play the, in the earthquake that happened in real time through the runs on oil. I also create a scores like that. They look like this. For example, when I perform the Mexico, I research all the earthquakes at that and that that had taken place in x in Mexico for the last 50 years. And I made a score that lasted eight minutes. So during the Amia, as I played on the size of negativity that happened in that place, so it was a very divided and very, uh, strong, uh, strongest score. So that, yeah, there's a, the score is based on the same seismic activity of in a specific place. And they also transform these into, into paintings. This is like a hundred a century of earthquakes in the u s and then I also have an a score, but this is transformed into a painting.

Speaker 4:          00:27:33       Okay.

Speaker 2:          00:27:33       And I also lead a, when I was doing the speed of, of the people walking in front of me, uh, I seen it and I traveled around and around Europe hitchhiking. And the aim was to rise to every capital and I would define each capital with the speed of the citizen's walking on it because I realized that depending of your context and depending where you are, you tend to walk faster or slower. I'm like, I'm amazed. I'm for scum and movement sense that we have like a involuntary movement speed that we share. So I made like a dictionary to define its capital of Europe by its movement and nail they its capital bureau by the dominant color of the cities. Yeah. Like in 2010 and I tweeted the Cyborg foundation basically with three aims. One is like to help humans to become works. A second one would be the to defend the sidewalk rights and a third one is to promote cyborgism as an art and social movement

Speaker 4:          00:28:34       eyes.

Speaker 1:          00:28:35       We've done different budgets, but we'll talk more about the, the following projects in the next week. We go into Brazil and we'll be developing this. I have some spaces in my mouth is something's missing. So instead of having no normal days Englander, we'll create a DS. The do things like, um, we did the prototype some years ago. It's the grades light. So in total darkness you can click and then you open your mouth and then you have some emergency light. The case where they'd was that when I was eating the language going on and off all the time. So we added removing now in Brazil, we'll try to make one here that will actually also charged by, by pressing it and it should create light, um, in another system that doesn't go on and off when I eat. And then the other space is the will god and tried to trade the Bluetooth tools that will allow me to control the antenna.

Speaker 1:          00:29:23       So, uh, if I want my antenna to move left, I'll be able to use my, these to move it left and right. So it will allow me to lie like a joystick, but inside, inside the mouth and controls through Bluetooth either this are the third option will be that we'll create two. This cosmo now also has a tooth missing, so that's good for us cause he has some space. And then we'll also use the creation of Bluetooth, this and this case to communicate. So we both know the Morse code. So if we both have a tooth that can transfer the clicks, then we'll be able to communicate through more scored from [inaudible] or from Bluetooth too, Bluetooth through Bluetooth as one. And also that this, we might just spend them blue as well cause then it will make more sense. So that's next week in in Brazil and it will have, will have one week intensive with 16 people working on it.

Speaker 1:          00:30:12       Also. Um, we created a Cyborg nest this year in, in London where we are actually offering sensors for other people. The first side is that we are offering, this is the north stands. It can be implanted here in the center of your body. And whenever you're faced north you feel a vibration. So it gives you a sense of orientation. If you have this vibration when you faced north west several months, it will probably become subliminal. So you will feel the north without even noticing the vibration anymore. So this is uh, something that, uh, a few hundred people will have very soon because it will be sent to people around the fall. Um,

Speaker 2:          00:30:49       yeah, my, my current project now and that I'm correlating with some people that are here, it's thought works. Um, I'm living like the seismic makes down to my faith because it feels like more natural to feel earthquakes and you feed and then I was hiding location cause now I just know when there's an article but I don't know where in the world. So these, I will know if they are too happens very far for what I am a very close and also like my next, my next project is to feel, has an activity on the moon because we feel that if we use internet as a sense, we can explore things that are happening very far from when we are like in the other side of the plant or even in the space. So if we all use, uh, AVL, Santa was census the space rather than we, as soon as we can become sense turnouts and explore a space where we are here but through our sensors. Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:31:35       Gimme since 2014 I've been connecting to NASA's international space station so that I can send you the colors from space. The beginning it was overwhelming cause there's loads of colors there that are very high bid. So it was overwhelming. But then I'm getting used to connecting to, to the station and then I'm getting used to receiving the college room space. So yes is extending our senses beyond our bodies but also be on our planets. So in in the future we might able be able to connect all our senses in other plans. Also when we have three d printers that can print our DNA, we might be able to three d print ourselves in other planets. So instead of traveling to other planets, we'll just need to three d print ourselves in Mars and then use the Internet to extend our senses to margin and feel it.

Speaker 1:          00:32:14       We are there, uh, and even have our body there without having to physically travel in a way we are doing now. This is our little experiments of, of sensing space. Also sharing these experiences by doing space concerts where I amplify the sounds from my head to the audience. The first concert I had to stop because I was getting dizzy of so many colors from space, but the audience had already left. So it was fine. It was too noisy. The second concert, someone in the audience had an epileptic attack. What is a seizure? So we had to stop as well. We'll do a concert here now so he will do just a five minutes. And then, um, well what I'm working now on with Adrienne and Sam at thought works here. New York, we are developing a new sense a, I've had this sense for 12 years now, so I feel I'm ready to add a new sense, completely different from color and is the sense of time.

Speaker 1:          00:33:07       We all have a sense of time, what we don't have an organ for the sense of time. There's no species that has an organ for the sense of time. So this is developing an organ that will allow me to feel time, it will be a crown between the skin and the bone circular. And then I'll feel different heat depending on the time. So it will take 24 hours for the heat to go around my head. So once I have it, I will know automatically what time it is because I'll feel the heat around my head. But then the, the question is whether or not this becomes my perception of time. If I have this for several months or years, I might not feel the heat anymore, but I'll feel the time it is. So then when this point happens, then I'll be able to modify the speed in which the heat goes around my head in order to change my perception of time.

Speaker 1:          00:33:50       So if I want time to go faster, I will change how fast I want the heat to go around my head and 19 theory. Um, my perception of the time will will be different. Or if I want to travel in time, I will be able to just the turnaround they keep several times and then I'll, I'll be traveling in time or if I'm jet lag or if I'm traveling, I might be able to put it on flight mode and then I might have less, um, less jet lag if I make it travel to this with the speed of the plane. So it's an experiment of taking Einstein's theory of time relativity into uh, a sense and into a sensory organ. And this will be more or less ready. This year I'm at least we'd have a prototype, which is usually an XO sense. There's exoskeletons which are assigned, but we also grade extra sensors, which are sensors that are permanently outside for a while until your brain gets used to it. And then once the extra sense is accepted by the brain, you can then have it implanted. So this is something that will happen here in New York,

Speaker 2:          00:34:42       this now and that now that we feel that Neon, I assign books that we actually don't feel cross two machines at the Roberts. We feel closer to nature. And to other animals because I fit closer to the planet because it's very different to know that the planet is moving, that to feel that in your body, that the planet is constantly moving. And also we think that we can get very inspired by other senses animals have because if we experience the world through, through the senses that all the animals having in our own nature, I would spin off the plant will be very different.

Speaker 1:          00:35:12       Yeah. We both think we are experienced in the renascence of our species. We are the first generation that can actually really design what sensors we want to have, what Oregon's we want to have. We can actually design what species we want to become. We can either get inspired by species of half senses and organs that we don't have an add them to our, uh, our bodies. We actually identify ourselves as trans species because we are a greeting or adding senses and organs that other species have. So we define ourselves as trans species and in the same way that the 20th century saw transgender, uh, becoming normal, I think in the 21st century. We'll see how trans species also will be more and more normal. We'll be meeting people with new senses and new organs. Some of these senses and organs will be a known by other species.

Speaker 1:          00:35:54       Some of them will be new because for example, Internet connection is a new sense that will only be used in certain cases. But we'll see that we'll be able to decide what type of species we want to become. And that's the exciting thing that we are experiencing now, especially when we have the option of three d printing new organs. Uh, we won't even need the electronics anywhere. We'll be able to modify our genes and create, um, also, uh, organic body parts. So the fact that we are now using technology will probably be obsolete in a few decades and we'll start using 100% organic, uh, Oregon's new organs. And also we'll be modifying our senses. So instead of, in my case, perceiving ultraviolet and infrared with a chip, it will be by modifying my jeans. So that's probably the end of the century. But we are both very excited about the possibility of these are, we can now start to explore, um, just when I think it's just this, this is just something extra that we are presenting various soon.

Speaker 1:          00:36:51       It's a new type of a close, it's, I'm a fashion show that we are presenting in October in the Queens Museum. It's close for the pose, a wearable generation. So people who don't want to wear technology, people who want to become technology will also need new type of clothes. In my case, there's no hoodies with holes in it, so I can't wear it because there's no brand that creates, uh, who this for people that have antennas, also people who have the chip here, uh, they need to charge themselves. So there's a, there'll be tee shirts with holes here so that they can plug themselves or they'll also have a door. And also with design, different types, of course, with different types of cyber. George Wilbur's be presented, uh, uh, in October 8th and the Queens Museum, you are all invited. It will be a catwalk. Weather models will be sideboards. There'll be 10 different types of sight words and there'll be wearing clothes adapted to these. There's new technological bodies. That's it. Thank you very much for listening.

Speaker 4:          00:37:49       How'd you play your colors from

Speaker 1:          00:37:51       space? I am alone will be performing the earthquakes that she feels during the, these five minutes. If there's no worries because there'll be no much running, but there's always

Speaker 4:          00:38:04       okay. [inaudible] yeah. [inaudible]

Speaker 1:          00:43:49       so you talked about a few different kinds of cyborgs. Um, and I, we were talking about earlier there were there these guys in Sweden, they have like a, we work and they've, everyone working in that space has implanted a chip under their skin and they just opened a door instead of swiping their budgets. Um, they just opened the door like that. So that would be a kind of Cyborg. You're kind of, Cyborg is a little bit different. So I know you've been thinking and talking a lot about cyborgs. Tell me, what do you think is high work is and we'll kind of cyborgs are there in your mind, you guys think in general there's like two big rooms, like the psychological cyborgs and biological side. I think you are all psychological cyborg. So we are all psychologically United to cybernetics. I in many ways, you know, there's this in language, maybe 20 years ago people would say, my mobile phone is running out of battery.

Speaker 1:          00:44:43       Now many people say I'm running out of battery as if they were the mobile phones. So talking about technology and first person is a sign of connection, psychological union between technology and humans. That's a psychological unit. Also, many people identify themselves as being cyborgs, but that their body is not cyber. But they, that's why they want to have an implant because they identify themselves as being cyborg. And then that's why they went to have surgery to become biological cybers in in the world of biological side, where's [inaudible], which is a biological union between cybernetics and organism. There's also two types. Uh, at least, uh, one would be that you are a cyber because of medical reasons. So it's not voluntarily not have a choice. Uh, it's, it's either also to regenerate the Briggs, this thing sends or preexisting by, and then there's voluntary side was people who voluntarily have added technology in their body in order to either add a new sensor, a new ability in the case of voluntary.

Speaker 1:          00:45:38       So I was, there's also different types. They would be sensory sidewards. In our case we are adding sensors. Uh, so it's a sensory cyborg. Then there's the cognitive side where you'd would be, if it's technology to add to things like memory for example. That's not the sense where it's something cognitive or if you want to have some implanted so that you can understand different languages. That's not the sentence. Also something cognitive. So it's a learning or being able to communicate in different languages with a chip. So it's communication. So that's more cognitive Cyborg. And then there's, um, physicals. I would say more about the, something more of a physical, um, implants. So that gives you some physical ability. And then in the case of opening and closing, it's not a sense. It would be also a type of voluntary side word, but it's a, it wouldn't be a sensory side where it wouldn't be more of a practical and cognitive may way. Cause I think you can share information as well with other people and also you can then track where you've been so it can help memory. So it's, it's a way of extending your, a cognitive or also abilities with technology.

Speaker 5:          00:46:44       Thank you for, it's such a fascinating and amazing talk. I was actually thinking if my four year old would be here, he would be like out of his mind thinking what is going on here. I've been very excited. Um, I have a question about that. The Fisk psychologic cause by Lowe's aspect in relation to that that uh, I was thinking how the, you also mentioned in the talk a little bit about subliminal aspect after awhile, once he had the chip, the sentence or the new sentence became subliminally that you stop actually listening or paying attention to that. But you're still nevertheless, you still had that sentence coming through in some way. So, uh, especially the, maybe the, the not for the light to, not for the color to the sound transform, but the earthquake sees firmographics and transform maybe easier that hey, now that I have learned that so much and the cognition had expanded beyond the sense or into my, the five senses that we had. Um, the new s chip isn't needed anymore. It's so part of me now that the nearby, if skin now have started by rating even without the chip and artspeak happens, I'm just thinking like how deep, how long and in general, like how long does it take to get that subliminal aspect?

Speaker 2:          00:48:12       I think for every, every person varies in any sense is always different. Like to learn a new language. Some people take a long time and some people, some people learn it really fast. So for me to wait a month or something to add, like really used to feel this and now maybe in the beginning I would start more lively, more this like if I would feel a strong innovation would have pauses when I talk or what I've been told that um, and now, yeah I guess this is normal I guess like if I don't feel it, it's when I, I I realized that that's something I haven't found this relations for a long time, but I guess in any nuisance and every person, that's exciting to think. For example, when the north sense several people will have the same sense, we had really excited to see what will happen because everyone will have its own experience and its own way of integrating these new sense in their own one is I'm like, yeah,

Speaker 1:          00:49:10       somewhat. If someone becomes a cyber there'll be two, two periods of adaptation. When is the, how the brain adapts to the new sense. That takes a while for each person. And then there's also the, how the body accepts the new body parts. So you can have brain rejection. Your brain might not accept the new sense or you might have body rejection, your body might not accept the new Oregon cause most sensors will need New Orleans because we don't, we think is not useful to use existing sensors to gain a new sense. That's why we reject them. They use of glasses or headphones or any of our existing sensors. We wanted to have new senses and that food, new sensory organs in our cases. So yeah.

Speaker 2:          00:49:51       Yeah. And before implanted regionally to prototypes or like extra senses like first the outside and when, then when we,

Speaker 1:          00:49:58       when the brain, next types of the new sense, then you can go for the implant. And then if your body accepts the new material in your body, then you've had both.

Speaker 5:          00:50:06       And is that a success ratio with you? They, oh, this sensor, I put it in as a headband or a hand. Men and my body's completely rejecting it.

Speaker 1:          00:50:15       Firstly, your brain might reject the new sense. So maybe I had this brain rejection. For example, my brain didn't accept all these new input, so I had strong headaches and uh, but I kept it on the Indian. The headaches went away. But some people might want to stop if they, if their body doesn't match. Mine does except the new sense. And my Mike, his body rejection, there was no rejection of the, of the implant material.

Speaker 4:          00:50:41       Nice. Thank you.

Speaker 1:          00:50:42       But I sometimes have antenna aches, which is something that, uh, then I just pick a, like I have headaches or say [inaudible] and then I take a tablet and then pin goes.

Speaker 4:          00:50:56       MMM.

Speaker 6:          00:50:58       I was curious if you, so synesthesia, it's uh, existing sentence. These people that are born with like a sound and color being molded together, they have, there's really no choice in what tones correspond to which colors. Do you imagine people that would have a similar implant to you could choose different tones to correspond to different colors. Uh, and then when you compose pieces of music, uh, like it will, that speech, that visual representation of a speech will only represent that speech to someone who has the exact same, who listens to colors in the same way that you perceive them. I don't know. Have you ever, I guess what, yeah, how do you define those relations?

Speaker 1:          00:51:35       Yeah, they didn't want to juice the, the sound of the colors. That's why I didn't choose, no one chose is the frequency of light. So if you could hear the frequency of red, you would hear the note that I hear, which is a microtone between F and f sharp. So each, that's why it's so micro tonal cause it's the pure transposition. Um, otherwise I would have done a much more simple scale cause uh, it took me three years to memorize the colors, whereas it good just take hours if you simplified the scale. So, um, it's a more objective way of possible is as bill buhr relation as possible. There's no subjectivity in this case. It's just physical transposition.

Speaker 4:          00:52:14       Yeah.

Speaker 6:          00:52:15       And then the, uh, talking about mixing it into existing senses, have you considered adding,

Speaker 4:          00:52:21       uh, yes,

Speaker 6:          00:52:22       sensors into nerves. And I don't know if you can do that without it being necessarily a painful response, but you're hearing, you're seeing through your

Speaker 4:          00:52:32       hearing,

Speaker 6:          00:52:33       you're seeing through another sense

Speaker 1:          00:52:35       nothing my case cause that what I hear is not what this is for me. The sense of hearing this is a vibration in my bowl that then becomes an inner sound bite is not like this. It's different. And it's um, if I was completely deaf I could still perceive color through the vibrations. So this is a new sense to me. And so, and also we don't have five senses. We, we might have five sensory organs, but we have many, many, many more sensors like the sense of gravity, for example, the sense of balance or the sense of humor. Oh, common sense as well because there's many sensors that don't have organs, like the sense of time, which is now the creation of a new sense of, of that we have maybe just, yeah, five sensory organs. But the fact that we have a long list of sensors that don't have hard.

Speaker 4:          00:53:22       Thank you. Oh, hello.

Speaker 7:          00:53:26       Uh, thank you for coming here. I have a specific question for Neil and full moon. So for me, for Neil's, since your equipment, is it connected to the Internet? What are the security risks of that and how do you deal with them? Um, and for a moon, how exactly does the feeling you, you're, your body gets upon seismic seismic activity. How does that, um, influence the way you interpret it whenever you perform the seismic activity?

Speaker 2:          00:53:56       Yeah, I feel to relations and the separations are really, really Sarah, like really low. And then when I feel it, then ninth I transform it with intensity. So the bending of intensity of the aeration, the move when I created this more intense or less intense.

Speaker 1:          00:54:15       Yeah. Having your body connected to the Internet has the risk of being physically hacked. So now there's five people with permission. But, uh, last year someone with no permission was able actually to hack, do send colors to my head, uh, without permission. So I was physically high action. Actually. I liked it. So it wasn't, but yeah, they could become annoying if someone started sending colors in the middle of the night, it would wake me up. So if this happens, then this could be secured more secure. But still, if there's a hacker in this room, they can easily find me and they could, uh, send colors. This is not as secure as it could be,

Speaker 7:          00:54:59       but like, I wonder if even just like all, just like trying to like filter out, um, which pat gets to authenticate what that alone could I, I mean, cadaver loan and we'll even though denial of service attack people or will you still be vulnerable to kind of attack even just by sending just like packets? I wouldn't be authenticated anyway if you got too many of them.

Speaker 1:          00:55:22       What does every, everything is hackable. Everything even so.

Speaker 7:          00:55:27       Yeah. Yes.

Speaker 1:          00:55:29       Well, yeah. And there's always the, I can always disconnect the Internet connection that I have this, I can stop this, the under, but I can stop the Internet connection. So if it was really an eye, I would just disconnect.

Speaker 7:          00:55:40       Oh, okay. That's good. Thank you. Uh Huh.

Speaker 8:          00:55:46       Uh, two, uh, two quick questions. I was kind of wondering just about some basic hardware, technological issues. Like how do you keep your implants charge, how often you have to recharge, MDF like charging ports on you. And then also you said that you hear like, you know, hundreds of different specific, uh, exact colors is different pitches. Did you have perfect pitch before you started this or did you learn perfect pitch from having the implant?

Speaker 7:          00:56:09       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:56:09       And then have perfect pitch. So I add relative pitch but then after three years, so yeah, if you hear color constantly, then it's, it's easier to, to learn. Perfect pitch cause it's it also in one octave and it's in a specific, um, timber. So I have perfect extreme, perfect pitch in an octave, in sine waves through bone conduction. If it's a, if I listened to a guitar, it takes me a bit longer to identify the note because it's a different timber and it comes through it. And if it's a different octave, I need to think a bit more. But yes, in that activists is now perfectly I, it took me three years to memorize all these microphones. So betweenF and f sharp, I have 30 micro tones. So extremely, extremely my good Donald and the charging aspect of of a a new sense and a new organ is very important as well.

Speaker 2:          00:57:02       The problems that we have in the sidewalk is the, I guess the power Paul Rum. Yeah. We would like to be able to power our and with our own energy that the license, that's the Yang. I have the bag.

Speaker 1:          00:57:14       Let's think I can change a small battery every five, six, seven weeks. The Benz, I remove it before it ends. But the aim is to use Durbin's in the blood vessels so that the blood circulation, we'll charge the, the new sensors, not, we don't want to use external energy, not even solar energy. One, they use the energy of our body. In the case of the north sense, people will have to plug themselves every night. So or so they'll have a way of judging the subs. And also there's ways we exploring with uh, Orient and Sam is the judgment external. Kyle. So you might have an implant was with Kyle. You can recharge it from the outside. Also with the toes next week it will be charged poly with um, like, uh, with your own kinetic energy. So there's still ways, but it's, that's the, whenever there's is solve, we'll see a boom of people with new senses and new organs cause that's the only parts of it that is really not evolving as fast. Thank you.

Speaker 9:          00:58:20       So I wanted to thank you for this presentation and uh, I also appreciated that you brought up, uh, transgender as a topic within this because I often feel as if I'm a psychological cyborg and I feel that, that it's actually a very common sentiment among my people. Um, I feel as if we are, uh, perhaps artists building the same thing with different materials, in fact. And so my question is a philosophical one in that, what do you think are the longterm implications of a species that is able to design and redesign itself at will?

Speaker 1:          00:58:56       Yeah. I think we'll have to adjust. The net would be many, many different types of species cause um, each, uh, human will make me born human, but then we'll be able to choose and decide exactly what sends an order is when you have and each person will be very unique I think. So we'll have a diversity that uh, society's probably not ready to accept. The diversity that will exist in the, in the fifties and sixties is a, is going to be something that many people won't be able to talk to tolerate or to

Speaker 2:          00:59:28       do you think then that this is a movement away from my binary mode of thinking and learning within the human brain?

Speaker 4:          00:59:35       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:59:35       Yes. I mean [inaudible] going to be on the binary do it will be, um, there'll be so many [inaudible] we won't be even able to understand, um, the types of realities that each person will experience. It will be even more different than it will be evident that it will be different. The experience that we all have of a reality.

Speaker 2:          00:59:59       We mentioned [inaudible] in the future and asking someone where were they from there. We also asked what sense do you have like, and everyone will have its own own perception or reality. That's beautiful. Thank you.

Speaker 4:          01:00:14       Right. Lovely to do so. We'll have to say goodbye. Thanks so much for coming. Thank you, Neil. Thank you. No.
