Speaker 1:          00:05          So it's my pleasure to introduce Arielle Berry, who is the founder and CEO of Mobile Odt. He's here to talk about catching cancer using AI enabled smartphones. A round of applause for him please. Thank you very much. Thank you

Speaker 2:          00:21          everybody. And thank you so much for joining me today and for inviting me. Thank you Ilana for this wonderful opportunity to share with you a little bit about what we're doing. And my goal for today is to share with you a bit of what is possible using today's technologies. Um, not so much from the technical side, but more from the structural side. I'm happy to speak afterwards during the Q and, a if you have want to go a little bit deeper, but, but what I would love to speak with you about today specifically is about health care and, and on a fundamental level, what health care requires more than anything else is information. So, um, when I started, uh, Mobile Ott together with my cofounder David Levitz, one of the things that we were struggling with was we had on one hand, it's technology, which was a under understanding their consumer electronic devices.

Speaker 2:          01:18          We're getting so much better thanks to the rise in mobile phones and we had a need out there. Um, we identified that cervical cancer, which we'll speak about in a bit, is a leading cause of death for women in rural areas around the world. And it was so easily treatable. But connecting the two was the question that we faced and what we realize this is part of the, uh, the conversation that we had with some of the world's leading public health organizations around the world was that in the end on the most fundamental level healthcare and the provision of good healthcare depends on data. And that's something that all of you and definitely Google knows a lot about. So if I can leave you with two things at the end of this presentation, the first one is that health care depends on information on data.

Speaker 2:          02:10          And then the second thing is that mobile computing will make healthcare accessible to every person on the planet. So with those two particular things, I'd love to jump into the presentation, share a little bit about what we do and then hopefully engage with you in conversation about how you might be able to use your superpowers in terms of your abilities as engineers, as business people, as operations people to save as many lives as quickly as possible. So I'll step back. My name is Arielle Berry. I have the absolute pleasure to be here today to represent a company called Mobile Odt mobile optical detection technologies. And what we do on the most fundamental level is use the power of mobile phones to address disease. Now there are a lot of different ways that mobile phones can be used to address disease. Some companies use apps that consumers will use to track their blood sugar or their blood pressure and intervene on a daily basis.

Speaker 2:          03:08          What what we believe as a company and where we're seeking to contribute is in prevention. So good healthcare is best suited to do preventable diseases, right? If you can catch a disease, almost any disease while it's early enough to treat, you can clearly and quickly treat it before a person gets to ill. And so you can save years of personal lives and thousands of dollars and families going into debt just by identifying disease early enough. And we believe that the people who are best suited to currently empower with such technology is our health care workers. And our mission, our mission as a company is to equip healthcare workers, the nurses, the midwives, the technicians, the clinicians that are out there serving the majority of humanity on a daily basis to equip them with the tools that they need to be able to provide better care. And if we look at that as a mission, then the question becomes as a company, where can we make the most impact?

Speaker 2:          04:11          And so we decided, um, to take dedicated caregivers to provide them with mobile compute labs and to help them make an evolutionary jump in their ability to provide health care quality, particularly in cervical cancer. So many of you already know this, but I just want to make sure that we're all on the same page. Cervical cancer is a leading cause of death for women in rural areas around the world. It's a cause of death that is in many ways the most tragic because the most preventable, I'll show you in a little bit how cervical cancer develops, but just on on one foot, cervical cancer can take up to 20 years to kill a patient. It comes from an infectious disease, the HPV, the human papilloma virus, and if you catch it within the first five years, you can treat it on the spot with basically the equipment you have in the kitchen for less than 28 bucks and less than 20 minutes.

Speaker 2:          05:10          So how can it be that a disease that is easier to cure than the flu is killing millions of women to decade mothers, pillars of their community? How? How is that possible? It's actually one of the fascinating things. It's because women aren't screened. So every woman, every single woman of reproductive age should be screened for cervical cancer regularly, whether it be every three years or every five years, depending on the technologies that we have available. And yet the majority of women around the world aren't. And all it has to do is that one moment of screening and that one moment of identification of disease in which a woman's life can go from the death column two, the life calmed. Now, what's fascinating is that despite the investment in maternal and child health, since 2015 since recently, cervical cancer deaths have become more prevalent than deaths from maternal and child complications.

Speaker 2:          06:07          So it's one of those things where it's just a little bit of investment in regular screening can mean millions of women alive to take care of their families. And that's not a problem just around the world's problem. Also in America, almost every person in reproductive age in this room, for sure, and many of the people who'll be watching online will at some point in their life contract the HPV virus. Human Papilloma virus is one of the more popular viruses today, and 79 million Americans are living with it at this moment. And what that virus does is it infects the cells. The cells that are infected with high risk strains of that virus will start to become inflamed, and then they will develop a disease. And if you catch it early, treat it. And if the body's immune system can, can flush it out, it'll flush it out.

Speaker 2:          06:55          Just like we flush out viruses every day. But for some Americans, and for many women around the world, the kills them. Now, the way it works is as follows, and apologies for the graphic images, but I think it's important to recognize because it is a visually accessible disease. So a normal cervix, the cervix, just for everyone who I learned this when I started, uh, at mobility of the cervix is where the baby comes out through, right? So it's, it's, it's part of the woman's anatomy and the cervix, a normal cervix is, uh, is fleshy and has squamous cell and uh, and Kolmar sells. I asked. The virus infects those cells, they start to become inflamed and visibly on the surface of the cervix, you start to see signs that that infection is becoming is beginning to grow. Right at that stage at precancerous stage, you can still just cut out those cells, literally freeze them out or burn the mountain.

Speaker 2:          07:55          A procedure that can take a few minutes using very, very simple technology that can be done anywhere, literally anywhere around the world. And that woman will go from the death column two, the life calm. But if you let it persist, then infection continues and those cells invade, then you get cancer. And at that stage it is almost impossible to save a woman's life. So you have this very long process that can take up to 20 years where from a normal cervix to a precancerous cervix, you have a five year window. And even during that period of precancer you can still treat easily. Now what's fascinating is that screening is only part of the problem. So anyone who looks at graphs will generally look at this graph and say, well, wait a second, the trends are going down, but I want, what I want you to notice is that from around the year 2000 until today, despite the fact that we've introduced tremendous technological leaps in cervical cancer screening, liquid based cytology, HPV testing, and most importantly, the vaccine, the number of deaths and the number of new cases have basically flatlined, right?

Speaker 2:          09:07          They have not gone to zero, which is what you'd imagine, right? All of a sudden we're vaccinating people and we're screening with better technologies and we're intervening when we can. No, we're still seeing thousands of women develop the disease and thousands of women die from the disease in America. Forget outside of the United States where those rates are growing every year because infection rates are, are growing. So the question then becomes, all right, so we have all these wonderful technologies, liquid based cytology and HPV testing and vaccination, and hopefully everyone in the, everyone listened to here is vaccinated. Why is this technology? Why are we not yet able to stop such a simply stoppable disease? Well has to do with lack of experts. So I like showing the map of the United States as opposed to the map of India or China or Africa because it's so striking. The red is where there are zero gynecologists. These are counties of the United States of America, one of arguably the most developed and economically successful countries in the world. And that is the map of lack of expertise. So if you catch the disease, what are you going to go?

Speaker 3:          10:18          Okay,

Speaker 2:          10:19          let me tell you something that's actually fascinating. When I learned that I, it blew my mind, 25% of women, one quarter of women, one out of four women who were called up and told you have a positive high grade lesion from your pap smear, you need to come in and get treated.

Speaker 3:          10:39          Do not return.

Speaker 2:          10:43          Half of women who were called up and said, you have a high grade HPV test, high risk HPV at us. You got to come in for your next, for your next appointment. Don't come in. And the question is why? Because the distance. And so the, and again this is an America where you have great roads and you have Amtrak and you have buses and you have the ability to get places in theory, right? Forget rural Africa or rural India, rural Southeast Asia. So the, the problem, the challenge is the connection of the patient and the expert and that's, that's what we sought to address. So, so this is the enhanced visual assessment system. This is eva. Eva is built around the technology that all of us, no one love the android mobile phone, right? The amazing thing about the technology that this company that Google has contributed so much towards and that we as consumers have supported and its growth is that it's become so powerful and its ability to capture images, process and analyze those images and communicate with a world of expertise that is on the Internet, right?

Speaker 2:          11:54          The things that we know and love from everyday interactions are actually critical to health care provision. And what that means is that those nurses, those midwives, those technicians that do see the majority of humanity by using a device, a medical device of FDA cleared CE marked medical device that was enhances the power of the mobile phone can now provide expert treatment wherever that woman is. So anywhere that you can take your phone, you can take any of his system, but obviously it's not just the mobile phone and it's not just the device, it's that what eva does and devices like it, connected devices like it is, it connects the cloud to the patient at the point of care and it connects the patient or the point of care and the provider, the healthcare provider at the point of care to the cloud. And that's what's so powerful about the moment that we're in.

Speaker 2:          12:45          And that's why there's such a moment of potential for all of us to contribute. Because once we recognize that in essence solving healthcare challenges is a solving a data problem. It means that every time that we impact health care, we can literally transform the way that healthcare services are provided through connecting dots, through connecting pieces of information. Now we've learned this and, and I, I'm, I'm going to stop the, the mobile Lutie t segment for a second. We've learned this by working nine to 29 countries around the world, a lot in the United States, but around the world as well on the African continent, in areas of the world in which cell phones are relatively new. But thanks to the, uh, unbelievable power of mobile devices basically can be taken anywhere. And what we've learned in all of those countries, whether it be in the most advanced cities in the United States and India, or whether it be an in the most remote areas across the African continent or in Latin America, what we've learned, um, rather than the question that we've asked though is, is how can mobile computing really transform healthcare?

Speaker 2:          13:58          And what we've learned is that it can do so in three different ways. So specifically, um, what I'm going to posit here today and, and, and the, the requests that I'm going to end up making at the end of this is that specifically mobile computing can help three means of intervention for healthcare. It can help in one identifying patients at risk. In our case, because we're still use cervical cancer as our, as our case study here, it can identify women at risk too. It can ensure that a poor appropriate treatment is applied and three is that it can show unsure adherence. They can make sure that the woman who was told that she's positive is treated correctly and then it's followed up with correctly so that cancer doesn't continue to become an issue. So let's go into those three quickly. First it can. I, uh, mobile computing can help identify women at risk.

Speaker 2:          14:49          This is a scatter plot of data that was, uh, was analyzed as part of a Kaggle hosted competition that Genentech, a large pharmaceutical company made available using symphony's data sets, symphonies, a large data aggregator here in the United States. And what the competition requested was for data science teams to look at this large public data set and identify based on this large public data set, which women are at risk for cervical cancer. And they found an accuracy of, I think it's over 90% and identifying high risk women just from public data sets. Now why is this important? Well, because the United States spends about six point $6 billion every year screening women for cervical cancer, six point $6 billion. 55 million women are screened every year and yet 10 million women are not. And out of those 55 million women, only 30 million women should actually be screened.

Speaker 3:          15:48          Okay.

Speaker 2:          15:49          So you're basically screening 25 million women who do not need to be screened and you're not screening 10 million women at highest risk that do need to be screened. And that's why African American and Hispanic women in the United States have rates of cervical cancer that are almost equivalent in some places higher than women in Africa and women in Latin America.

Speaker 2:          16:10          Because we're not screening the women that need to be screened and we're overscreening the women that don't need to be screened. That's just the data issue. It's just the data problem. It's something that can be rather straight forward solve. And once you have that information and you can reallocate resources accordingly and you ensure that the right care is going to the right patients, then you can make the right decisions as to who needs to be taken care of. So that first one is just identifying the women that need to be screened. The second one is applying the appropriate treatment. This is the basic workflow for how cervical cancer screening works in the United States today. And it's the same thing with the pap smear as well as the HPV test. So let's go through it rather quickly. Woman comes into a doctor's office, she lies on the table, the providers scrape, sells off the cervix, puts a little bucket, closes that bucket, gives us a medical assistant.

Speaker 2:          17:01          Medical assistant, takes it and brings it into the front corner. They call logistics company logistics company comes in, picks up the buckets, takes them to a lab lab than unloads it, brings it to the technician, technician then takes it, stains it after they stay in it, they didn't take it and put it under a microscope. They look under the microscope or they look under it as part of an essay to look whether there is presence of HPV DNA there. Then identify whether or not that woman has had something that is high risk. They then write that down. That then gets oftentimes faxed back to the provider. The medical assistant takes that facts, looks at the medical record types and information into the medical record. If it's positive, then it goes and talks to the doctor, the doctor that it needs to make a decision. Hm, maybe I'll call back that patient. And then the medical assistant calls up the, the patient and the patient three weeks later after she had that test taken, needs to be rescheduled. Little Bit complicated, right?

Speaker 2:          17:52          So that tire period of time for those three weeks after a patient has come in and gotten the test taken, she doesn't know. And oftentimes wage workers role, Americans, single parents have a hard time of scheduling. That next fall they just moved mountains to be able to have their annual physical. So they get a call and they say to and and the medical assistant says, listen ma'am, you've gotten a positive pap smear. And the woman says, all right, I'll, I'll, I'll call you back when I can reschedule. I'm at work now. And then she has a million things that she needs to do when she forgets. And that's why I added the six point $6 billion that we spend every year screening women in the United States. 1.2 billion of that are due to nonadherence to women that are lost to followup because she wasn't able to schedule that next visit in time.

Speaker 2:          18:38          And then she comes back the next year and she's positive again and she says, Oh God, you told me last year I was positive. And then they need to schedule again but they don't all come. And so that long process leads to women going from the life column to the death calm. Now what we're doing at mobile and it is what we've found is that you can replace that whole process of collecting the sample, sending it to the lab, and then bring in the woman back for the next step through applying pretty fundamental machine learning algorithms to the images that you capture using a colposcope. So there's some fascinating groundbreaking work that will be published pretty shortly that I'm not allowed to talk about too much, but I'll try to share the basics of in which the National Cancer Institute and the National Library of medicine have done extraordinary work to prove that our partners that global good have been able to identify cervical cancer with an accuracy pretty high, a little over 90% just on a single image alone. And that is extraordinary because what that means is that while the woman's in the clinic without her going and going through that entire process and 0.6 seconds, she can go from the death column to the life calm.

Speaker 2:          19:51          And that's just the beginning, right? Because what's fascinating is that these algorithms, because remember cervical cancer, just like many other diseases, visually assessable, these algorithms and we already know and love and a deploy on an almost everyday basis, many of you in this room probably write those algorithms and they're based on cafe, on tensor flow. Now we're moving towards tensorflow lite. There's simple, straightforward machine learning problems. Interestingly enough, computer vision didn't really cut it there, but when you build a large enough data set, and currently mobile Ott is proud to have large data sets in the world on cervical cancer, you can use that to identify disease at its earliest stages using nothing more than a visual image. So that that has to do with applying appropriate treatment. Because if you can apply that treatment on the point of care at that moment when the woman's in the room, you can do so much more for that woman than anything else.

Speaker 2:          20:44          But then once you apply that term and you need to make sure that she's actually taken care of, right? So the patient examination, which most medical devices do pretty well, is only a very small link in the chain to ensure the patients are kept healthy because after that woman is examined and we need to communicate with that woman what it was that was seen and what it is that she needs to do and if the appropriate treatment isn't there. If it's not for cervical cancer or it could be for any other type of disease, she needs to be referred and once she's referred, then we need to make sure that we update her record because if we're not expressing to the other person what it is that you saw, then they might miss it because in the end, clinicians are only human right and they only know what to look for if they're told what to look for.

Speaker 2:          21:29          Again, it's a problem of data and once that patient record is updated and the provider provides the appropriate treatment, then you want to take that information and you want to warehouse it because you want to have information about how disease spreads within a population. Remember, cervical cancer is a communicable disease. It comes from the human papilloma virus and there's so many other diseases like that. If you can find trends, you can know how to allocate resources effectively and then once you have that data, you can start identifying patients and then once you identify those patients and you need to examine them, and that continuum is what makes healthcare and that continuum is a data problem. It's a communication problem. It's a problem that we've solved in social networks, but we haven't yet solved in healthcare, but we can now. So for that there are three things that to close off the more frontal part of this and to start our conversation, there are three things that I would ask of you.

Speaker 2:          22:30          Have all of you here and all of you that you know that have those super powers that you're applying at Google and that you're applying in all of your work outside of it. First is let's, let's help us, let's help the healthcare system identify patients at risk, right? Let's take public data sets and identify how we can more clearly map vectors and then express that information to health care organizations so that they can deploy the proper resources and the most effective and efficient manner so that those healthcare organizations can do what they do best and care for patients. Let's also apply the appropriate treatment devices. Have a huge amount of data exhaust and obviously if you have garbage coming in, you have garbage coming out. And that's why for mobility tea, we believe that the critical component is ensuring that you have control over the type of information that comes in so that you can apply the appropriate information that comes out for analysis.

Speaker 2:          23:32          So let's connect more devices to the cloud. Do it with all the proper unnecessary security precautions to ensure the patient privacy is kept, but you identify a woman from her cervix, nor can you identify a man from his or for annual cancer or uh, or any person from their, uh, from their skin disease. Let's use that information so that any provider, anywhere, any nurse, any midwife, any technician that can take a mobile phone and bring it into the, into the field, let's make sure that every member of humanity has the same access to the same high level diagnostic accuracy just by ensuring that they all have access to the right information. And then finally, let's ensure adherence. We've learned so much about social dynamics over the past decade alone and yet we're not doing a very good job of ensuring that that woman that gets called [inaudible] told that she has high grade precancer, we're not doing the job, bring her back.

Speaker 2:          24:35          How is it that we're able to get her to order stuff on, on, on online shops, but we're not able to get her to come back to a clinic or get the clinic to her. We understand the social costs of having mothers die in their, in their, in their most important ages. Let's intervene. So figuring out how to do that, that's, that's a data problem. And so the, the key, the key here is to do the examination, the analysis and enable the action immediately at the point of care to do that calculation fast to do it wherever it is that that happens, that the patient is to bring health care to wherever the sick are. And that's where mobile devices are so powerful because they go wherever we are and almost every person on the planet now has one. Now we're doing our part mobility t by taking the same technology that sits at the heart of this device, enabling a mobile phone to be turned into a medical device and applying it in other diseases that are visually assessable.

Speaker 2:          25:39          Anything that you can identify with your eye that a clinician identifies from endoscopic procedures to, to skin, you should be able to do with a mobile device. You just need to tweak it. So using the right optics, the right illumination, the right structures and so on. But there's so many other ways to do it. And we're hoping that every device company, that every technology provider, we'll start thinking about how they can use their core resources to ensure that their technologies are being used to save lives at the point of care. And just the last thought, once again, is that data is critical and it's the mobile element that enables that data to be actionable. So all of us here have that native understanding just because we use our phones every day. So let's use them for something that ends up saving a life that might be otherwise lost. Thank you all very much and I hope that you join us in making healthcare accessible to every person on the planet. And I welcome your questions. So there are two, uh, I was asked to say there are two microphones, uh, there are eliminated by the spotlights. If you have any question at all, I'd be happy to answer them. Um, and no question. Is that a balance?

Speaker 4:          27:04          Hi, thanks a lot for the talk. Um, so I have two questions. Um, the first is you mentioned the accuracy is around like, uh, a little bit higher than 90%. Can you talk about like maybe the breakdown of that in the sense of are there false positives or false negatives?

Speaker 2:          27:20          Absolutely. So, um, there are a number of papers that I could refer you to the, the seminal paper that will be coming out soon. We'll break down a lot further. What, what I can say about it is that what's fascinating about the cervix is that it's a, a pretty clear example of squamous cell carcinoma, which means that as the cells start to proliferate, they start to show visibility. Now you will get false negatives, but the sensitivity and specificity are both above 90, which means that you will know that you're seeing something and you will more or less know that that thing is cancer right now. To compare that to the pap smear to HPV, HPV, Katcha HPV testing catches a ton of people who have the higher restrain that will never develop into cancer because only 5% of the people who have a high restraint of HPV actually will end up developing the cancer. And the test just looks for the strain of HPV DNA. Right? What a visual examination does is it looks for when the cells are already growing and that's when you want to, you want to, you want to nip the bud, right? You want to take away those cells where the infection occurs. And in, as far as the literature shows, now around 97% of cases, it'll never reinfect.

Speaker 3:          28:37          Thank you.

Speaker 4:          28:38          Um, and I guess the second question, this is, I'm, um, so the common, um, I guess barrier with healthcare is, um, sort of gaining access to data primarily because of privacy issues. Yeah. Um, can you, like, you mentioned that there's like a large database that you're probably using to train the algorithm. Can you talk maybe about like what has been done in that end? Like how, what's the current status? And I'm like, how are the, uh, healthcare providers like responding to, um, to a need for technology companies to have access to that data so that we can help them?

Speaker 2:          29:20          Yeah. So first of all, it's, it's a fascinating challenge. I just came, we, one of the, um, one of the, uh, organizational networks that we work with are the Centers for disease control. The CDC and I just came from a conference in Atlanta. The CDC is informatics conference. And, um, one of the things that I learned there was that even within the healthcare system, even within the CDC, one organization to have significant challenges sharing information, right? And it's, it's, it's one of the ironies of the day where we can track almost every human on the planet. We know where they're going and what they're eating and we're, you know, what they're doing more or less, but we can't keep them healthy because the information that we get from healthcare providers, this is all walked up, right? The way we address it just by building our own database.

Speaker 2:          30:08          So every time that somebody uses our system, we have that information and it's de identified and we structured our database in silos. And so any one of those pieces of information, every one of those tables has a different lookup function. And so you, you can't really get the information about who the patient is with information on what the provider thinks with the rumors about who the provider is with information about what the resulting diagnosises, right. So you have the ability to structure it. So any one of those pieces is de identified by nature. And what we're hoping is that, and I know that Google is involved in this and a number of other organizations, this is what we're hoping is that these standards will start to propagate. That is every piece of equipment that is somehow digitally connected should enable others to learn from it and to integrate it and to build through it solutions.

Speaker 2:          30:56          And, and I, I've been, I've been very surprised for the good and for the bad about how that works within different healthcare systems. Um, so, you know, you have some of the, the more, uh, so we work in, we work in countries where, you know, the, basically there are no land lines, you know, everything is mobile phones and, and, and there are countries like that that, um, that some of them are very comfortable with the cloud and some of them, even though their data center is literally, you know, an open shack with that that sometimes gets rained on, they want things to be hosted locally. But thanks to containerization, you, you can do that, right? If you build a proper microservices architecture, you can, you can make it work. Um, so I think that we're going to get there, but we just need to get more people to sign on to interoperability standards and we need to ensure that people recognize that this literally has to do with saving lives. And so delaying is costing lives,

Speaker 4:          31:51          I guess as a followup park. Um, so what, um, if you are collecting that information, there's always that fear of your data being misused or being identified. So I guess even for me, if I were to go through this, it would be like, all right, like how do I know that there's no one that does a neat to see this data will not, will not see this data. So on your end, what do you do to protect the data that you're collecting?

Speaker 2:          32:17          Yeah, so first of all, it's what's called secondary use data by nature because no one other than your provider has the information of who you are and what the examination is. So we cannot be identified by our cervix or by image, depends on what images of our skin, but you know, you, you cannot be identified by it. It's just not, there aren't public data sets available to ensure that kind of identification of a person based on one mole or, or on a cervix or an oral cavity even. Um, and so because of that, you know, the image and the annotation is did edified by nature. So there's no risk from that perspective that a woman would be identified. Um, but yeah, we need to structure correctly. And so when we structured our database from the very beginning, we made sure that there was, that you literally needed to, they had a salt and a house lookup table between the different tables to make sure that in any which case you'd have to kind of connect so many different pieces of data in order to re identify someone. But you just don't give people the keys so you don't make that available.

Speaker 5:          33:19          Oh, thank you. Of course. Absolutely.

Speaker 3:          33:23          Okay.

Speaker 5:          33:24          Yeah. Hi, thanks for the talk. So the question might be out of scope of this talk, but it's still, do you know of any efforts where machine learning is used to diagnose cancer or other diseases? Um, based on other kinds of images like Mri scans or CT scans? What are those?

Speaker 2:          33:43          Yeah, absolutely. Um, so first of all there was a, there's now a tremendous amount of information being made publicly available around the world. Thanks. The national governments and large healthcare system. So I just heard that, uh, the National Institutes of health just published a huge data set of MRI based images. Um, I know I just heard from a friend of mine here that you can all speak with after that his father in law is doing some exceptional work. I'm down at Hopkins and identifying cancer in its earliest stages and colorectal or pancreatic, pancreatic cancer. Um, so there, there, there's more and more information becoming available, right? And, and that's critical. So I think that the, the, the, the real goal has, and this is where I'm going to speak for my thesis, so, so, so my thesis is that smart devices are gonna make the difference. So data sets are great, but as all of you were, engineer's, no data set is only good so far as the source of that data is reproducible.

Speaker 2:          34:38          So if the data set, if you have a data set, but the way of collecting the data changes than the type of analysis that you had, the class are you built based on the earlier data may not be relevant for a future, uh, for future data. And so one of the things that we, we believe as a company is that tying the data to the device and ensuring that as a full solution you can control the way you bring data and the way you annotate that data and the way you analyze that data and that becomes a, a a virtuous cycle. Then you can really provide Karen. So more and more companies are starting to recognize that as well. Ge has a huge initiative around it. I know that others also, um, and I think that as people start thinking about medicine as the application of expertise and devices and an extension of the ability to provide medicine, then we'll see more and more of that.

Speaker 2:          35:32          So there is scanned, I mean I think Google did a project on the eyes. There is a MRI scans, CT scans and, and others. And, and what I find very fascinating is that, um, that it, for the past 20 years there've been different approaches that mainly use computer vision. Um, but really where the breakthrough is business and applying really standard off the shelf models. And I'll give you an example. That might be a little crude, but it's interesting because it was just fascinating. So it took us a pretty long time to develop an algorithm that can kind of identify the cervix. And then some of you will know that there's a, there's a show on HBO show called Silicon Valley. They, that, um, open source the, or at least gave a walkthrough of how they created an algorithm for hot dog, not hot dog. We took that hot dog, not hotdog instruction.

Speaker 2:          36:22          And within three days we built an algorithm that was cervix, not a cervix in three days. It took us like a year to do it before. And then with the new tools that literally just became open, it took three days. And that exponential, I mean a lot of arrhythmic shift in terms of speed and potential is astronaut. It's just, it's crazy. Right? And it also makes sense and this is one of the things that you know, that that's why the, you know, your superpowers is engineers are so critical here because um, what is fascinating is that, um, you have here a a moment in which, um, we knew for, for all of history, we knew that human beings have the ability to perceive information and to use our brains in order to find patterns in that information and then to make decisions, right? I mean, that's what medicine is.

Speaker 2:          37:12          Medicine is where you have a person who's, you know, a magician, so to speak, a doctor who goes through many years of school in order to learn all the different things they need to learn, they get to that point of care and they make very educated guesses as to what to look for based on what they see. They referenced information that they've learned to make certain decisions. And then based on the decisions they make, the person either lives or dies. Right? Well, algorithms can see tens of thousands of more patients than doctors ever could just because they can literally reviewed tens of thousand more patients. So now we have the ability to actually do what the doctor doctors have done in a way that we simply couldn't before. Yeah.

Speaker 6:          37:49          This, the anonymized data collected by two mobile order duty. Um, um, I was able to, with our people to a shutdown Lord our, uh, is our proprietary.

Speaker 2:          38:02          So we do have a data set that we made available through Kaggle, uh, in a competition that Intel sponsored on type of cervix, which is critical for treatment. Uh, we're going to be making more and more data available to the research community and we're, we're very excited to work with folks, so please feel free to contact me at anytime and I'd be happy to, to share information.

Speaker 6:          38:18          Um, and on a similar note to have you taught is using this device has as a means to collect art to collect data on all the other sorts of tabs. You use an image to the IRS. Yes.

Speaker 2:          38:31          So we already have the ability to do into scopic procedure is oral. Absolutely. Which is critical. Absolutely critical. Okay. Yeah. Thank you.

Speaker 3:          38:39          Yeah.

Speaker 7:          38:40          Hi. Hi. Um, I would just look a little clarity on how exactly the product works. So I saw a photo with what looked like an attachment sort of scope, sweat for Server Kush answers specifically. Are you taking images from the pap smear swab?

Speaker 2:          38:55          No. So I, I usually don't show it cause it's a little more graphic for people who aren't aware. A woman will lie on the table and something called a speculum is inserted just like inserted today to take a pap smear or a colposcopy. And our device, which is classified as a colposcope, which is a long range microscope to look at the cervix, the vagina and the vulva is placed at a distance. It never touches the patient and at a distance it images the cervix and based on what it sees and what the provider sees, they make certain decisions. So at this moment and what the providers are doing is using this as a long range microscope to look at the patient and based on what they see they make decisions. And over time, as we start to provide more and more guideline interventions and workflow interventions, it will also guide them to do more and more. And so one of the things that we've, the, so for example, um, we have a wonderful partner in the rotary club in San Diego and they built a partnership between, uh, the Jalala about hospital in Afghanistan and scripts medical center in San Diego. And the first cervical cancer screening program in Afghanistan was started because eva systems out in Afghanistan were being used by midwives and a gynecologist and San Diego was watching what they were doing and providing them with tips on how to actually perform the examination.

Speaker 7:          40:04          Thank you.

Speaker 2:          40:05          Absolute pleasure.

Speaker 7:          40:10          Thanks again for the talk. Have you found cultural barriers in terms of using the actual device and if so, how do you overcome those? How do you do education so that the women who are receiving care feel comfortable with the idea of a more complex device being used?

Speaker 2:          40:23          Sure. Um, so first of all, what's been,

Speaker 3:          40:25          mm hmm.

Speaker 2:          40:27          We've found amazing universality and certain elements that we had not previously expected. Um, so the first, there are cultural differences in terms of insertion of a speculum. A speculum insertion is problematic in certain places and for obvious reasons. Um, once you get past that hurdle, which has nothing to do with us, then it's pretty straight forward. It's just the visualization and any place in which a speculum is inserted there used to a woman visualizing them. Um, what's been fascinating actually culturally is that what we noticed the first than Kenya proved to be correct also around the world, which is that women loved seeing an image of their cervix because women had never seen their cervix. And remember in emerging markets, in rural areas and Roisin in America, cervical cancer is a leading cause of death. So they will know a woman who has died and cervical cancer.

Speaker 2:          41:20          So they hear again and again that this something they shouldn't be worried about, but they don't know what it is. And so to be able to turn around and say, this is what I saw, look right here, you have to go and get this treated was huge. And as part of the interview is one of the woman called it. I saw my cervical selfie right there. They had this, this moment where it was, it was very empowering for her to see what she looks like on the inside and, and, and in doing so reduce that, that fear barrier. So I think that that's critical. I think it's critical across all of healthcare that is, you know, in the end, health care has to do with the person, the patient, right. So we met many times medical device companies, um, think of healthcare in a very abstract form. And that has to do with providers and payers and institutions and networks. It has to do about that woman, that one woman, and that one woman needs to own her health because if she doesn't take care of herself, no matter how much the health care system is developed and robust, she'll die.

Speaker 3:          42:18          Cool. Thanks very much. Absolute pleasure.

Speaker 2:          42:21          So we'll take one more question and then we'll, we'll start to wrap up. Yeah.

Speaker 4:          42:26          Um, so my question is more on a marketing standpoint. So who is your target that you're going to words and trying to sell this to? Like are you allowed to say how much it costs or is that something that you're keeping under wraps right now? Um, but just more of a marketing where you're trying to go to, is it hospitals are different organizations and stuff? Sure. That

Speaker 2:          42:46          so mobile Ott works primarily with health care networks and hospital networks. Um, although obviously the person who uses it as a, a nurse or a midwife or a gynecologist there, procurement officer is generally the person who purchases it. Um, in the United States, we sell them for 4,000, $800 each for, for this generation, um, which is about 20% of the price of a traditional unit. And the goal is for price to never be a barrier, right? We want to make sure that every provider and every corner of America and the world pricing obviously is lower globally. We'll be able to provide the care that they're called to provide when they provide it. And there was a, there was a slide here that I wanted a, I'll show you in a second, which is important for us from a marketing perspective. Um, the woman here, the, the, the icon here, that's, that's who we call eva, just like the product's called Eva. That's Eva. And Eva is who we engage with. Eva is the care worker or the nurse, the midwife, the technician, that woman that serves Dan Knight to serve the majority of humanity. And we seek to work with her. So from a, from a, from a basic service perspective, our goal is to provide that person with a tool she needs and we'll work with her healthcare system, with our hospital network to give her the tools she needs to provide care to our patients.

Speaker 3:          44:05          Pleasure.

Speaker 2:          44:06          So I'll just, I'll wrap up, um, on a, on a very basic request from all of you. So I'm on, you know, when, uh, when I was given the opportunity to, to, to come here and thank you, Elana again for making it possible. Uh, the thing that kept on going through my mind was how, uh, uh, to use a lack of a better term, how pregnant with potential, um, this organization, Google and companies it are for impacting the very fundamentals of healthcare lessons that we have learned over the past decade and how to identify individual support. Those individuals through choices ensure that they get to the right information at the right time with the right people are lessons that are immediately applicable to every person on the planet. And Mobile Ott can only do its part in it. And hopefully we'll continue to strengthen the way that providers provide healthcare. Organizations such as yours and others in your peer group have so much opportunity to be able to fundamentally affect a human condition on whether a person lives in other year or just not. And so I, I hope that you could use your superpowers, whether it be from marketing to business to engineering to ensure that no person, no woman, no child, no father, no a man dies of an easily preventable disease. Again, thank you very much.
