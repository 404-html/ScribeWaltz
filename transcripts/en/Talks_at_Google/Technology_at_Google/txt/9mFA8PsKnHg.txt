Speaker 1:          00:05          Like many of you, I'm very curious about the future of blockchain and how it might integrate into various frameworks of our society. Uh, and for that we have a very special guest today, Dr Tonika Tillaman. Uh, Dr Tillaman is the chairman of the global blockchain business council. He's a co founder of the blockchain trust accelerator. He is a member of the advisory board of the bid fury group, which is a leading food service blockchain company. Great. So, um, I'm sure most of you guys are already familiar with blockchain and cryptocurrencies. Uh, but the Mica, can you please just very briefly explain those concepts?

Speaker 2:          00:52          Absolutely. And I should clarify that I spend most of my time explaining these concepts to audiences that maybe spend a lot of time working on high level policy issues or a c level executives in big corporations, but don't know that much about technology. I realized that is not the case today. So I am thrilled to have an audience here that I'm sure we'll have incredible insights on the technical aspects of this technology beyond some of the policy and business, uh, components that we're going to discuss today. Block chain at its core is just a record. It's, it's a very simple concept to wrap your head around. Humanity has been using records for about 5,500 years since the time of Sumerian tablets. So in that sense, this is not something that new, but it has two dimensions that are big innovations. So when you put those together, it unlocks functionality that we have never had access to before.

Speaker 2:          01:46          The first thing to know about blockchain is that it is distributed. Uh, it is stored in the case of Bitcoin blockchain on thousands of computers all over the world. All of those computers contain an identical, identical copy of the record. And what that means is that they're constantly checking each other to ensure its accuracy and integrity. Uh, so that's one important dimension of this. The second is that it is permanent. Once a piece of data is entered into a data block and walked into that chain, hence the name, you can't change it. You can update the information, but you can never erase the information. So if a government wants to wipe out the, the contents of a blockchain, it can't do it. Uh, if a company wants to wipe out the contents of a blockchain, it can't do it. They are designed to be incredibly resilient and incredibly, uh, secure.

Speaker 2:          02:38          Uh, and those are very important when it comes to this, this permanence that we're talking about. When you put those two pieces together, uh, the distributed nature of the record and the permanent nature of the record, it provides the opportunity to do some things that we've never been able to do before. It is an independent source of, for any information that you put in, you can validate that something was created at the time you say it was created because it's logged in the blockchain. And again, nobody can monkey with it once it's there. Uh, you can assure that a boat has been tabulated correctly. If it's hash to the blockchain, you can ensure that a property record, uh, has been registered in the way that it's supposed to be registered. It has the potential by virtue of this independent distributed, uh, and permanent functionality, uh, to solve a lot of problems around trust. A lot of problems around corruption and a lot of problems around transparency. And those are all big issues that we are wrestling with in the world today. And because of that, I feel it's a very important technology for all of us to hopefully put our arms around.

Speaker 1:          03:46          I agree. Um, do you think there's any doubt at this point that blockchain technology is going to become mainstream?

Speaker 2:          03:54          That's a great question. Uh, I think blockchain technology today is in very much the same place that the Internet was in about 1993 or 1994. Uh, and what that means is that this could go any number of directions. There is no a fore ordained course for the technology, but the functionality is incredibly important. And again, the functionality enables us to do so many things that we'd never been able to do before, that the functionality probably isn't going anywhere. Theoretically, somebody could come along with a technology that will provide that same functionality in a way that is potentially a little bit cheaper or potentially a little bit more efficient. So that could theoretically again derail adoption of the technology. Uh, but in terms of what it can do that is here to stay. And I would imagine, I would expect that it will become a ubiquitous technology, uh, in the course of coming years.

Speaker 1:          04:52          Uh, so with your experience in politics and civic and institution, can you describe, uh, your vision for global adoption of blockchain and what are the key steps in this transition

Speaker 2:          05:06          that, that is a big question and we could probably spend the better part of our time here discussing that. Um, a couple of things. First, Bitcoin, which is the application of blockchain that most people are familiar with. And again, I imagine it is a, not a news announcement to those in this room. Uh, but blockchain was originally developed as the rails to power bitcoin and has since been adapted into a variety of different applications. Um, bitcoin is already gaining pretty broad global adoption and eh, the first place where you are likely to see blockchain applications take hold a is in financial technology. IBM came out with a survey a little while ago that estimated that in the next three years, 65% of all big banks are going to be using blockchain. So this is a technology in that space, certainly as it, as it relates to payments as it relates to moving money and financial assets back and forth, uh, has kind of already reached the tipping point.

Speaker 2:          06:06          That train has left the station. So that's stage one. That's exciting. There is again, a misperception that this is something that is going to happen soon in practice. This is something that is happening right now. Uh, so, uh, don't anticipate that it's going to be years and years before you see those use cases rolling out. The second piece of this will happen when you see adoption and what I call a intact or institutional technology. Uh, some people call it Gov tech. Uh, but these are the entities that validate the facts that make up kind of the base layer of reality that we all have to agree on. And, and here I'm going to pause and kind of zoom way back for a moment if you will forgive me. Yaka uh, there was a, another great, uh, toxic Google speaker, a historian named Yuval Hariri who asked an important question a couple of years ago.

Speaker 2:          06:56          He said, why are humans in charge? Why, why are we the ones that run the planet and not fish or rang a tanks? Because theoretically it could be Jelly Fisher Orangutans. And what he recognized is that humans are able to do two things that other species can't do. The first is that we can cooperate flexibly. Uh, and the second is that we can cooperate at scale. So if you look at other species, you find some that can cooperate flexibly, like wolves and dolphins, you find some that can cooperate at scale like bees or ants, but nobody else can do the two of those together. The way that we are able to do that is we come to a consensus on kind of a base layer of reality, a certain set of facts that everyone is willing to sign up for. And once we do that, we're able to go off and in many different verticals pursue our own individual agendas on the basis of those common facts.

Speaker 2:          07:49          What blockchain is going to allow us to do potentially is create a new form of consensus around basic facts. And that is if, again, if we do it right, uh, a solution that has the potential to supercharge collaboration, to supercharge cooperation in ways that we've never been able to work together previously. Um, and so as you see institutions that keep track of who owns what, who voted for whom, uh, who owns which piece of property start to move their activities on the blockchain, you're going to see a very big new chapter in the history of human cooperation. Uh, and, and that's going to be really cool. What happens at that stage I would suggest is that we're likely to see the emergence of business models that we find it difficult to even conceive of right now. But business models that take advantage of, uh, the tokenization of assets, uh, where we take a, anything that we have a chair, a car, uh, I have kilowatt of energy and have the ability to transfer that back and forth seamlessly. If you think about the last 20 years, what you and others at Google had been working on a is really facilitating the frictionless peer to peer exchange of information and what blockchains should enable us to do, uh, is engaged in the frictionless peer to peer exchange of assets. Once we hit that tipping point, a lot of exciting things are going to happen really quickly. I'll stop talking there. That's a very long, complicated answer.

Speaker 1:          09:22          Okay. Uh, I want to ask specifically about governments because the ironman traditionally are one of the, you know, latest adopters of technology. And how do you think a government might adopt blockchain either as a currency or for administration and vendor? You think that might mean?

Speaker 2:          09:43          That's a another very good question. Um, so two pieces. Uh, first, how will governments use blockchain? I would suggest that the first iterations of government, uh, utilization of blockchain technology will be focused on how you can provide an added level of assurance around data integrity. Uh, and this is already happening. A project that we have been heavily involved in a is moving the country of Georgia as land registry on a blockchain. Why would you want to do this? Why would you care about putting a land registry on blockchain? In many parts of the world, if Jasmine has a nice piece of property by the lake and I want it and my cousin works for the land registry, I go and talk to my cousin, my cousin's signs that property over to me. And because the registry controls the record, there's nothing that you can do about it.

Speaker 2:          10:36          You are out of luck at that point. Uh, and it would be nice to say this is an isolated phenomenon. This is not an isolated phenomenon. This is something that happens on a very regular basis. So if you work in a country or live in a country where people have those concerns, if you can take those registries and move them into a format where even if you've got a corrupt official with access to the information, they can't go in and wipe out the evidence that it was Jasmine's property to begin with. That's a big deal. And citizens are going to sleep a lot better at night, especially when it is a in conjunction with something as important and fundamental as your home. So those would be the, the early iterations. And again, that's already happening. A Georgia system is active. It has about 200,000 records according to the World Bank.

Speaker 2:          11:26          It is now the number one system in the world, uh, for land registration. So we've seen good progress there. A Dubai, his pledge, the by 2020, they want all of their government, uh, transactions to be taking place on blockchain. Ukraine has committed to moving all of their transactions on the blockchain and we see many other countries around the world that are starting to dabble in this, in the United States. We've worked over the last year with about eight government agencies that are investigating different use cases for blockchain and starting to stand up their own pilots. Uh, there's enormous potential there. And again, at a moment when we are facing a real crisis of confidence of trust in institutions, this has the potential to be a very valuable tool for governments who are, uh, working desperately to Regaine and win back some of the confidence of their citizens.

Speaker 1:          12:18          Uh, what about the pushback of the corrupt official? It's like how have they overcome that? Do people have the power to overcome that pushback?

Speaker 2:          12:26          That's said very good question. Uh, and you see kind of two dynamics. There's some countries and you know, I speak now as somebody who spent the better part of the last decade working in nations around the world that we're struggling with issues of governance and trying to get their democracies to function properly. Uh, there's some countries where the leaders in charge don't want any transparency and don't want any accountability. And I would be very surprised if you see many of those countries adopting blockchain technology. There is another pretty wide swath of countries where people in charge actually do want more accountability and transparency, but the systems they are working with are so dysfunctional and so broken and so corrupt that it's extremely difficult to impose those solutions from on high. Those are the cases where blockchain could be pretty transformational. Uh, and in some instances I think you're going to get rigorous pushback from those in the bureaucracy, uh, that are benefiting from the status quo because once they recognize that it will make it much more challenging to engage in corruption, they may be a little bit concerned. But in other cases, what we're finding is that this is, uh, a sufficiently large transformation that even people on the wrong side of the equation right now understand they're better off supporting this and working to build new, more accountable and more transparent business models and lives for themselves on the other side. Uh, then they are fighting this outright. So I've actually been surprised and impressed by the extent to which there hasn't been more pushback at this stage of the technology's adoption.

Speaker 1:          14:11          Yeah. So Kyle, these governments that are adopting or government institutions that they're adopting blockchain, they typically create their own blog chains or do they use existing ones?

Speaker 2:          14:22          Uh, yes is the answer. And that's another exciting dimension of this. When blockchain technology first emerged, people thought there were only two flavors of blockchain, public blockchains like Bitcoin, blockchain or the ethereum blockchain, which run on computers all over the world and anyone can set up a note and be part of those networks or private blockchains that are defined. They exist within kind of a walled garden. You can only set up a node on that network if you're invited and have the appropriate credentials. What we're finding now is that some of the most powerful functionality comes when we actually layer blockchains. And when you use public blockchains and private blockchains in coordination, uh, I'll give you an example of how this is working. In the case of Georgia, the Bitcoin blockchain does a lot of things really well, but it is not ideally suited to processing big chunks of data.

Speaker 2:          15:16          So if you have a complicated map of a property, some place, it's going to be really tough to store that in the Bitcoin blockchain. So in this case, our technical partner, the bit fury group, developed a solution called Exxon him, which takes a snapshot of the registry, uh, every few minutes. And Hash is that blockchain or stores that a static snapshot, uh, in a public blockchain. So what it allows you to do is design a solution that's bespoke. You can get very high, uh, transaction rates. You can get really big data blocks as part of this system. Uh, you can do it exactly the way you need to do it, uh, but then you have the data integrity and the security that comes with logging that data are hashing that data to a public blockchain. And I think that's where a lot of the public sector applications will eventually end up, uh, is using this layered approach, uh, that anchors information to a public blockchain, uh, but actually stores the information in a private blockchain,

Speaker 1:          16:21          uh, in, uh, among current politicians and government officials, uh, especially in the US. What's their current perception of blockchain?

Speaker 2:          16:33          No, that's a, it's an excellent question. I have a good friend who spent a long time working at the White House and after she left the White House, somebody came to her, a former colleague who had gone on to MIT, came to her and said, hey, I really think you should get involved in blockchain technology. Uh, and her response was, uh, that's criminal money and you're crazy. And, uh, I think if you had to be honest about it, that is the perception of a lot of folks in government right now. They, they view a blockchain and bitcoin and everything associated with it, uh, as something that they probably don't want to dabble with. Uh, and, and this mutual friend of ours said, well, you'll wrong. Take some time to learn about it and come back to me once you have a, and you know, she reached the conclusion that this had the potential to be a transformational tool for supporting good governance.

Speaker 2:          17:25          And I went through that same process of realization. Uh, and I think what we are are focused on right now and a lot of our educational efforts, both with the global blockchain business council and with the blockchain trust accelerator, is working with policy makers to help them understand how they can use this tool to solve public problems. Uh, and you know, what we've seen is a pretty dramatic transformation. I'll give you just one additional anecdote in that department. Uh, almost exactly a year ago, may have been a year ago this week I went into meet with the, uh, president's staff at the World Bank and said, this is something that's really important, uh, this has the potential to dramatically change the way you do business. And I think you should spend some time and energy understanding how this works. And they looked at me and smiled and said, you're adorable. That's really nice.

Speaker 2:          18:18          Uh, we don't do early stage technology. Come back and see us in five years and we'll have a conversation. And a about six months after that, they gave me a call and asked me to keynote the launch of the World Bank's new blockchain lab. Uh, and in October we cohosted with the World Bank, uh, the first ever blockchain summit, uh, that they convened on the margins of the World Bank's annual meetings. So we are seeing that narrative play out in institution after institution and organization after organization. And I think there's immense potential as we try to help policy makers and others with the capacity to deploy these solutions at scale, understand what can be done, uh, if this technology is harnessed correctly.

Speaker 1:          19:04          So you mentioned the global luxury in business council and the luxury infest accelerator, um, in addition to promoting blockchain, uh, in, uh, among politicians, uh, what specifically these organizations also do and are they related? What's the connection between them?

Speaker 2:          19:24          Great question. Um, so these organizations both started out of as series of conversations that we had during a very difficult, challenging business trip. I took to Richard Branson's island in the Caribbean and he hosts an annual blockchain summit. And a while we were there, we surveyed the landscape. This was now about a year and a half ago, and saw that there was an enormous amount of investment and activity around Fintech or financial technology applications for blockchain, far less was taking place in the governance and social impact space. And we wanted to solve that problem. So we set up a partnership called the blockchain trust accelerator that brings together a number of different communities and a number of different organizations. Uh, first the, the place that I worked at New America, we are a civic incubator and think tank. Uh, our board is people like Eric Schmidt who chaired our board for many years and then David Brooks of the New York Times.

Speaker 2:          20:20          Uh, then we, uh, pulled in one of the world's largest blockchain companies, the big fury group. Uh, then we invited organizations that work on solving public challenges. The National Democratic Institute, which is chaired by Madeline Albright and the Rockefeller Foundation has since joined us. And together we work to identify pilot projects in the social impact in governance space that can benefit from the application of blockchain technology. And then we educate, build communities around those solutions. So, in addition to the Georgia project that I mentioned earlier, we've also worked to take, uh, the world's largest registry of civil society organizations, 900,000 organizations from around the world. Uh, and move that registry, uh, onto blockchain. We've worked with partners in the UK who are doing polling and public engagement, uh, in, in the UK parliament, uh, to help them build pilot projects around blockchain. And we have many more in the pipeline. So that's the blockchain trust accelerator.

Speaker 2:          21:18          We're always looking for partners and talent. Come talk to me afterwards or send me a note if you'd like to work with us. The global blockchain business council emerged out of the World Economic Forum meeting in Davos and it is a group of leaders from about 40 countries who saw a real need to shape the deployment of this technology on a global Blake basis. Uh, we bring together public sector actors, policy, uh, thinkers, uh, and also a lot of very important partners in the private sector to look at how you can, uh, provide people with the information they need, especially c suite level leaders to make good decisions around their use of blockchain technology. How you can build partnerships, uh, that will harness this technology successfully. Uh, and how we can shape a regulatory environment that's going to be conducive to hopefully capturing some of the value that can't exist if we do this. Right.

Speaker 1:          22:12          Uh, so you mentioned, um, uh, regulations, uh, what, what current regulations and regulatory frameworks already exist and what's about to emerge?

Speaker 2:          22:23          That's a very important and challenging question. We're seeing two big approaches in the United States. Regulators had a adopted an attitude that they're not going to regulate the underlying technology. What they are going to do is regulate activity that occurs on the platform. And they're going to do that largely using existing tools. So if you are, uh, for example, uh, issuing securities using blockchain, which is a thing, as some of you may have heard, uh, there has been a phenomenon called the initial coin offering, which is a, a, a mechanism for tokenizing, uh, in some cases value in companies, in some cases, other things, uh, and, uh, raising funds on the basis of those offerings. Uh, then the sec is going to take a good hard look at what you're doing and if they determine that what you are doing a, it looks like an initial public offering, then they're probably going to come down on you pretty hard and regulate you the way they would, uh, an initial public offering.

Speaker 2:          23:24          In other instances, we see countries that are looking at the technology itself. Uh, and here, China's an intriguing example. There's been a great deal of interest and enthusiasm on the part of Chinese officials, uh, in the use of blockchain technology. Uh, I was in China earlier this year and we were accepted or received by a, I think, seven government ministers, a provincial governors and justice of their supreme court. Uh, and about 1500 corporate leaders. So this is a technology that has a very broad audience in China, but there had been some concerns on the part of Chinese authorities about the underlying technology in part because it does exist outside the realm of government influence. It's not something that governments can turn on or off. If you think about this in a European context, the Europeans have a law that I'm sure many of you have dealt with a that deals with the right to be forgotten or so called right to be forgotten. You can't forget anything in blockchain. It's technically impossible to forget information in blockchain. So there's some, there's some new challenges that will emerge at a regulatory level as we bring blockchain solutions to scale. Now

Speaker 1:          24:35          sending issue with blockchain is our long transection processing times, which I've sort of slowing the amount of adoption. There are a few proposed solutions to this, but nothing that's really gone mainstream. Um, are there any solutions that you're aware of that are likely to, they come in?

Speaker 2:          24:55          So that's a great question. Uh, as you point out, technically there some pretty compelling fixes that have been developed that solved the problem of, of long transaction types. Uh, a former Googler took a lot of those fixes and package them into a cryptocurrency called light coin, uh, that has had a rather meteoric rise in the last couple of weeks as well. So we know that technically you can build blockchains that will solve for these challenges that have very high transaction rates, uh, that, uh, facilitate, uh, again, as I indicated earlier, larger blocks of data as part of each new link in the chain that constitutes the blockchain. What we don't know yet is whether it will be possible to push all of those solutions or some of those solutions, uh, into the Bitcoin blockchain, which is at the moment experiencing a fair amount of congestion, uh, in the context of, uh, uh, pretty extraordinary increase in the valuation.

Speaker 2:          25:56          A big bitcoin over the last couple of weeks. Uh, and so I think there is an open question there. Bitcoin may turn out to be, uh, something that is used primarily as a store of value and for very high value transactions. And in that case it probably won't matter too much. Um, or if you want to make it mainstream, you will have to adopt some of these new solutions, uh, in, in conjunction with the existing rails. Uh, and that is more of a political challenge, a among the various data centers that, uh, operate the bitcoin network, uh, because the, the bitcoin network is maintained by a decentralized group of entities that are often referred to as minors, although I think that's a really weird and lousy name. Um, but the, the entities that operate these data centers ultimately have to come to agreement on which of the solutions they're willing to bring into the network.

Speaker 2:          26:51          And that will determine, uh, I would suggest the likely, uh, transaction, uh, throughput that will be possible in the network going forward. It's also important to recognize just one more point on this, that if you had tried to run youtube on the Internet in 1993, it wouldn't have worked that well. We would have had some serious challenges in doing that. And again, we're in 1993. Um, so there will be, I'm pretty confident, uh, more and better solutions developed for these challenges as the technology matures. Hopefully some of you in this room or watching will be able to come up with those fixes.

Speaker 1:          27:31          What about some of the other pitfalls of, of blockchain? For example, the relatively high power consumption, a volatility, forks and plates, risks of mining, pool takeovers, a et cetera. Do you see any of these as a concern?

Speaker 2:          27:49          These are all the easy questions and you just lumped them all together there. Um, so let's, let's try to go through those, uh, in, in some sequencing. First power consumption. Right now, the network does use a lot of power. Uh, ironically that's one of the things that makes it so secure. If you wanted to hack that, we only know really one way to hack the bitcoin network, uh, and that is to amass a computational power that is equivalent to more than 51% of all the computational power in the network. In order to do that right now, it would take about as much electricity as a medium sized country, uh, uses to operate. So this is not an easy thing to pull off. And again, I, ironically, it's one of the reasons that the network is so secure. A lot of the responsible companies in this space are using renewable energy, uh, and they are running the network off of clean hydro.

Speaker 2:          28:47          They're running the network off of geothermal energy. But there are, uh, some, some important reasons to think about what happens is this technology becomes more ubiquitous. I would view the electricity consumption of the network at the moment, less as a bug and more as a bounty, a $200,000 bounty that's issued every 10 minutes on finding a efficient, clean energy around the world. Uh, and ironically, the spreading popularity of blockchain may be one of the, uh, forcing mechanisms for encouraging greater adoption of cheap, clean energy. If we do it right, there are questions there. It's not a foregone conclusion, but that's certainly one direction that this could go. Um, some of the other challenges that you mentioned, uh, the, uh, issue of, of what happens if there are in the network, um, that is a problem that I suggest will be solved eventually with the maturation of the technology.

Speaker 2:          29:50          Right now what can happen and has happened on rare occasion is that if, uh, someone who is part of the network decides that they don't want to, uh, run the dominant protocol anymore, they can go off on their own and create what's called a fork in the chain and, and develop their own a new chain as part of the bitcoin network where as part of anyone else's network, uh, that doesn't wipe out the assets that you have stored on the network. Those assets, uh, continued to exist on both networks. Uh, but it does create a problem if you're trying to keep track of things. As the technology becomes more ubiquitous, as the size of the network increases, it will be harder and harder for any actor to create a dominant alternative, uh, to the main chain. Uh, and I think that is, uh, you know, again, something that we're already seeing, uh, as, as the technology moves forward and as the valuation a Bitcoin increases, uh, but it's something that we'll want to keep an eye on going forward.

Speaker 2:          30:54          So it is a very volatile acid right now. Uh, certainly there are a lot of people making a great deal of money off of that volatility. So a, again, for some folks, this is a feature rather than a bug. Uh, we're seeing a couple of developments that should help tamp down volatility in time. The first is, uh, as many of you likely heard today, we saw the launch a bitcoin futures. Historically futures have, uh, a moderating effect on prices and volatile assets. So to the extent you're able to create futures contracts, that should limit the extent of, of the volatility within the asset. Uh, the second thing that I anticipate will have an impact on volatility, uh, is the spreading adoption of the technology. The more people that are using it going forward, uh, the less likely you are to have wild, wild swings in the valuation of the asset.

Speaker 1:          31:47          Oh, you've only talked about some of the opportunities far building infrastructure and apps. Do you have anything else in mind? Uh, that might be a particularly great idea.

Speaker 2:          32:00          So I can tell you some of the amazing solutions that we're seeing come our way, uh, at the blockchain trust accelerator and in the global blockchain business council and, and some of these are just immensely exciting at a number of different levels. Uh, we were approached by one firm recently that's developed a blockchain based mechanism for doing distributed power generation in off-grid villages and developing countries. Why is blockchain relevant here? How does this work? You can now buy for about a hundred bucks integrated systems that will combine a solar panel, a battery, some light bulbs, cell phone charger, and, and the other pieces that you need for basic electrical system, uh, in a little hot in a rural village someplace. Um, so that's, that's pretty cool that we can do that. The problem is that in these villages, very few people have a hundred bucks that they can throw at one of these systems.

Speaker 2:          32:57          And up until now, there hasn't been any good mechanism for financing the deployment of these technologies, these technologies at scale. So what we're able to do with blockchain now, uh, is create a fixed, whereby you pay four, $5 of electricity and you put that money into a blockchain system and agent puts that money into a blockchain system. And then you get a text message and then you put that text message, uh, into the electrical system that's been installed in your house. And you get two months of electricity, uh, for that $5, which is a lot less than you would spend on kerosene. And it's a lot less than you would spend on, on wood. So really good solution for everyone. And then in two months when the agent comes back, you give him another $5, they put that into the blockchain, they send you another code, you get another two months of electricity, and eventually you're able to pay off that system.

Speaker 2:          33:50          So that's one kind of micro example of how we're seeing blockchain a deployed, another really cool example, a company called box Gov, which has, uh, for those of you who do ventures, some of the coolest unfunded tech, uh, that I have yet encountered. They figured out a way to scrape the 80% of all information produced by governments that isn't available via a Google search or any other search and curate that and make it beautifully visualize a bowl and you can sort it and slice it and dice it a thousand different ways. They then are going to put that information on a blockchain, a framework. One of the issues that governments all over the world experience and our government unfortunately is not immune to this, is that when new folks come in and they don't like information that is stored by the government, they get rid of it.

Speaker 2:          34:39          Uh, we saw this earlier this year with climate data that was stored by the environmental protection agency in the United States. And there was an effort to wipe out and on a race, some very important climate data, uh, that had been gathered by the EPA. This is a solution for that and it, it will enable you to have a very secure, auditable record, uh, of, uh, all information that's produced by a government, uh, and you know, again, search it, visualize it, do a lot of other cool things with it. The last thing that I'll mention involves the deployment of grants and government funding or other public resources went now the u s government, every year issues $144 billion in improper payments, $144 billion in improper payments. That's money that goes out the door because people haven't validated, uh, the, uh, the recipients on the other end, they haven't checked to ensure that the recipients are alive.

Speaker 2:          35:43          There are whole host of problems that come into play and around the world right now, corruption is about a three point $6 trillion problem. Uh, if you listen to the United Nations that just, uh, to translate it is about 5% of global GDP, which even by Google standards is a big number a, and what you have the potential to do with blockchain is create a system where as money goes out the door, it's tracked, you know, where it's going, you can follow it. It's visible to anyone on the network. And we're seeing a host of different actors developing solutions right now that should enable unprecedented levels of accountability and transparency in the way that public resources are spent. The biggest impact for this technology could eventually come in emerging markets, uh, that may effectively skipped copper and go straight to these next generation systems for deploying financing, uh, around the world and, and deploying funds around the world. And it could have a really profound impact, not only in terms of attacking that three point $6 trillion problem, uh, of a official corruption, uh, but also in pushing resources and investment into geographies where right now it's not flowing. Uh, and, and that's an important thing for all of us.

Speaker 1:          37:01          Current trust in politics is at an all time low, I think it is. And uh, could chain how to restore our trust in politics. And then in specifically the, the, the issues that we're dealing with, uh, like people, um, believing that their representatives don't have their interest at heart. And in many cases they don't. And like things like people not telling the truth or there being multiple versions of the truth. And, you know, these are the big issues.

Speaker 2:          37:34          Absolutely. Um, a really crucial challenge. If you look at the data, uh, at Davos this last year at Edelman, the public relations company releases something, uh, each year for the last 17 years called the trust barometer survey. And, uh, they got up, Richard Edelman got up to release the trust barometer this year and said, we've never seen anything like this. You know, this is as bad as it's ever gotten in every sector that we monitor, we see cratering trust. Uh, if you look at the Gallup data, which goes back much further to about 1973 there again, we are at all time lows. So this is in, in many respects, the challenge of our time because again, as we talked about earlier, the story of humanity is a story of collaboration based on trust. And if that trust leaves, if you don't have access to that trust anymore, you're not going to be able to do all the other cool things that we're able to do.

Speaker 2:          38:27          So this is really foundational. Blockchain could very well be that solution. Uh, certainly my hope that it is going to that solution. Uh, and we're trying to tackle this from a couple of different dimensions. Uh, the first is if you look at the, the problem of fake news, which it seems weird that something, you know, two years ago and nobody knew what it is, is now ubiquitous. Um, but this is a real issue. Uh, and I was asked to come have a conversation with the leadership of a very large social media platform a little while ago to discuss how blockchain could be used to create a supply chain for information that flows through their systems. Uh, and an essence, once you create a story, once you create some news, if you anchor that news in the blockchain, uh, or in, in a blockchain, you can do a couple of things.

Speaker 2:          39:20          You can validate where it came from. You can validate when it was originally posted, which turns out to be very important in many instances a, and you can also point back to it so that each time it's posted on a social media platform, you'll know whether it comes from a reliable, trustworthy source that has issued a lot of good stories in the past or whether it comes from the fly by night operation that is notorious for pumping out bad data and bad information. Uh, so I think it could be very valuable in that context. We've also created at the blockchain trust accelerator, a working group to look at how blockchain can be used in voting. We have big problems around, uh, voting, not because our current system doesn't work so much, but because people don't have confidence in our current system. Uh, and in, in some instances we do have shortcomings.

Speaker 2:          40:13          If you talk about overseas military, uh, in the United States, they have a horrific mechanism for casting their ballots, which means that in many cases they're giving up the anonymity of their vote, uh, and or their vote isn't counted at all because it comes in too late to make the deadline for the election. Uh, so we're working to figure out how we might be able to deploy building solutions that will give them a chance to cast their ballot in a trusted manner going forward. This combined with some of the anticorruption functionality that we talked about earlier, I hope is going to make it much easier for citizens to have confidence in their institutions

Speaker 1:          40:52          after every surgery of price of cryptocurrencies. People begin to think it's a bubble and it's all going to crash. A including right now, um, can in European can value of cryptocurrencies continued to rise? And is this still a good time to buy?

Speaker 2:          41:11          It's an interesting question. Um, I, it's certainly can continue to rise, uh, and it could continue to rise pretty dramatically depending on the assumptions you use. It's easy to come up with scenarios in which the value of a single bitcoin, uh, is justifiable at $250,000. It's easy to come up with scenarios, which the value of a single bitcoin is a justifiable at a valuation of $1 million. Um, it's also easy to come up with scenarios in which the value is much less than that. And so this could go any number of directions. Uh, you know, my, my advice would be, uh, I think multifold the first is don't invest so much that you're going to lose sleep over it. Um, and you know, that's, that's been what I've done. It's cost me some money because had I gotten an earlier, I probably would've made more. Uh, but I have plenty of friends who have a substantial portion of their net worth tied up in cryptocurrency.

Speaker 2:          42:08          And, uh, it is, it is a challenging thing to have a substantial portion of your net worth tied up in cryptocurrency because of the fluctuations in value. Uh, but again, if you look at this basket of assets as a new analog for gold and as a new mechanism for conveying value around the world, there's vast potential there. Uh, and I think it's very likely that a, again, as we see a broader range of organizations coming to the table, including, but especially institutional investors that are looking for assets that are what we say, a, they're not correlated to anything else. And, and cryptocurrencies as a whole aren't correlated to anything else, which is a big advantage if you're a big institutional investor. Uh, there's a lot of potential upside there. Uh, so we'll, we'll see how this goes. I think it's also important to invest in those that are developing the, the picks and shovels, uh, rather than, uh, just the gold itself. So I, I've tried to focus most of my engagement now on companies rather than currencies.

Speaker 3:          43:16          Thank you for the, uh, for the informative answers. So you have been talking about transparency all the way. So what about privacy? Like, do I like to everyone in the world to know how I spend my money on all my private, you know, life. Um, how do we balance this in the blockchain world?

Speaker 2:          43:33          It was a very important question. And blockchains are actually really good at keeping private information, private and public information public. Um, the bitcoin network is not anonymous, so some people think it's pseudo anonymous, but you can structure blockchains in ways that provide far higher levels of security than virtually any solution that's available today. Uh, we're seeing some countries, uh, latch on to this, arguably the most advanced he government in the world is Astonia and Astonia is moving medical records on the blockchain because they feel that it provides much higher levels of accountability and security and privacy. Uh, then their existing solutions, and again, their existing solutions are really, really good. Um, because of the way that the network is structured and the fact that all of the nodes are constantly checking each other, it's almost impossible to see information, uh, on a blockchain that shouldn't be seen.

Speaker 2:          44:33          Uh, it would require, again, this massive investment of the electricity in computational power. Uh, in order to crack, uh, one of the blocks of data. So there's really great potential, uh, for the use of blockchain as a tool for promoting privacy. It's also important to recognize that at least as it relates to financial transactions, uh, in a public blockchain, people can see what's happening on those rails. We could open up a browser right now and you'd be able to see every single transaction that's occurring on the bitcoin blockchain. So folks should keep in mind those two. Again, as we develop more advanced blockchain solutions, uh, it's going to be a very important tool for guaranteeing the privacy of data. Uh, but, uh, at least as it's used for transactions, folks shouldn't be under the illusion that their information is a anonymous or secure in that regard.

Speaker 2:          45:27          And forgive it, forgive me if this is a rudimentary question, but from an ecosystem perspective in the future, may say five years down the line, having an ecosystem in which you have a number of blockchains versus maybe one or two main ones in which everybody can pile into. Is there a preferable approach here or will it not really matter? And you know, per use case will dictate the, the development of one main blockchain or several smaller ones for interested parties, so to speak. Very important question. Uh, and again, I would harken back to 1992, 1993 for an analog here. What we saw at that time as that a lot of companies and a lot of different organizations started setting up these very novel things called intranets that many of us will recall. And they said, well, there's this weird space called the Internet. We're not sure that we want to be a part of that yet, but we'll, we'll play, uh, within our organization for a little while and see how we like sharing information using these new rails within our organization.

Speaker 2:          46:28          And after a couple of years, everybody said, wow, this is really cool. But it's also kind of stupid that we can't talk to our friends that work across the street or do business with them. Uh, and so we're now going to ladder up to the Internet. And you know, you guys, I think know the rest of that story. Uh, my expectation is that we're going to see something pretty similar, uh, occur in the blockchain space. There will be a lot of different flavors early on. Uh, we will see lots of analogs to intranet being stood up and eventually those solutions will come together and it'll be very seamless for organizations to work, uh, on blockchains across different platforms. Probably using one or two, a big main spines as they're the conduit for a lot of that interaction. Uh, thank you for all the information. Um, I just have one question.

Speaker 2:          47:20          You mentioned something about, uh, investing in the picks and shovels. Could you talk a little bit more about what exactly you mean? Yeah. So some company, some entities are using a cryptocurrencies and, and that's great. Cryptocurrencies as we've discussed, I had the potential to be useful for a lot of different things, especially in countries that have bad financial governance and where citizens are looking for alternatives, uh, in, in my mind, what is more exciting even than that and what has captured the imagination of a lot of folks as the ability to use blockchain as a vehicle for other applications. Uh, and the tools that are going to be built on top of blockchain or that harness blockchain, uh, I think are going to be every bit as valuable, if not more so to humanity in the long run. Uh, then, uh, the cryptocurrencies that are kind of the first killer app, uh, for, uh, the technology that we're, we're, I think all excited about right now. Does that make sense?

Speaker 4:          48:23          Um, you just mentioned how we can use a blockchain to help you hold governments more accountable, but at the same time, we need cooperation from governments, you know, to give the original information. So, in that push and pool, how would you, how do you sort of foresee how to use it as accountability mechanism? You know, especially with the most corrupt or entities or departments or, you know, um, whichever areas,

Speaker 2:          48:51          great question. Blockchain works best when people want to be accountable. When you have an organization that wants to do things the right way, that is willing to give good data, uh, because frankly, you're not doing anybody any favors if you put bad data into a blockchain. That's one of the key lessons that we've learned in our work thus far as you really don't want to deploy blockchain in a setting where you don't have access to good clean data. Um, so you need actors that are willing to, uh, willing to move toward a solution. Uh, early in the process. There are still going to be some instances, for example, uh, if you're in a situation where you have, uh, evidence of humanitarian abuses or war crimes, I can envision a scenario in the not distant future where a reporter on the ground in Syria or in DR Congo, we'll be at the log video to block chain and create an iron clad chain of evidence that will be useful for a future war crimes prosecutions.

Speaker 2:          49:57          Uh, so you can easily come up with scenarios in which the tool can be harnessed in settings where there's bad governance, uh, but the most profound benefits are likely going to occur in settings where you have political leaders that want to do the right thing and bureaucratic bureaucracies and institutions that don't have the capability for whatever reason, uh, to deliver accountability. And, and hopefully in those instances it can be pretty transformational. So I'm going to think it's going to start with good guys first and then gradually progressed to the most corrupt ones and they're going to be eventually recurrence. That's been the path thus far. And what I would say on that point is eventually, again, if we do this right, the gravitational pull of being part of these systems is going to be so profound. The benefits of, uh, being part of these networks will be so profound that every government is going to want to be a part of this. Uh, because if you're not just like, it's really hard to exist in the 21st century if you're not part of the Internet, uh, it's going to be hard to exist if you can't send assets back and forth using these tools. Or if you can't reliably and accountably track some of the key vital information watching this will be used to track.

Speaker 5:          51:15          I'm just trying to understand the specific advantage that blockchain would give in the example you used is a good one that distributed solar in the developing world. I mean, because those kinds of financing schemes exist now pay as you go mobile payments, mobile money. So what is the actual incremental benefit of doing that in blockchain versus what's already being done?

Speaker 2:          51:36          Well, blockchain in, in a whole host of settings in emerging markets is going to allow for much higher levels of confidence when it comes to pushing resources into the field and tracking impact. Uh, and so as a tool for impact investment and in particular it could be really transformational. What it will allow us to do if, again, if we build these systems right, is set up enough data sensors and data inputs that we have a very good idea, uh, of what the outcomes are associated with these investments. Um, so for example, if you are considering whether to finance the shipment, a lot of these batteries, solar systems to small rural villages, you need really good data on which to base that financing. You want to know exactly where the systems are, how they're being used, uh, the rates at which those payments are being replenished.

Speaker 2:          52:31          And it's going to make it easier for everyone to trust each other. Especially in settings where there's a low level of confidence in the data. Um, the analog I might provide is that if you and I, uh, decided you want to build a house and you want me to build it for you and I'm going to hire some subcontractors. If we decide at the outset that we're all gonna use the same set of books for that transaction, for that project, everyone's comfort level is going to go way up because we can all see what's happening. We all know where the money is at every given at any given time, uh, and you have confidence that nobody's ripping you off. Uh, along the way. That's what we should be able to do at scale with blockchain deployments in emerging market environments,

Speaker 5:          53:12          do you see quantum computing as a existential threat for blockchain technology?

Speaker 2:          53:18          That's a very important question. Uh, no is the short answer. The reason why is because there's a lot of work underway to develop quantum resistant blockchains. Uh, and these are watching is that will be based on a quantum market texture, will harness quantum architecture, uh, in ways that make them extremely secure. Now, in the immediate term, if somebody were to come up with a fully functional quantum computer tomorrow prior to the full maturation of quantum resistant blockchain technology, then it would be a challenge. Uh, but the, the hope is that these two will progress in parallel. Uh, and ultimately you should be able to port existing data onto quantum resistance blockchains in the future.

Speaker 6:          54:02          I hate to Micah, um, I had a question about, um, I'm not quite exactly sure how to express it, but maybe you'll get the gist of my question that like, um, if we depend on, uh, like organizations that want transparency and want to be good actors to like use blockchain, like it seems like it would be a rather limiting because like, we've already seen stuff, like I feel like the American government is pretty hostile to the idea of like lots of, lots of economic activity going to like Bitcoin for instance. Right? Because they want to be able to control things. They want to go to tax things, that sort of thing. Right. Um, when in inherently lead to situations where like, um, you'll, you'll like the only people who will be willing to take the risk of going through all the trouble to like go through these things will be the people who are doing things that are kind of shady, right? Because like if I wanted to do something like, like buy a book with Bitcoin right now, it's like way more effort than just using USD, right? Like how do we overcome that thing if, if cryptocurrencies ever actually going to be useful, you know, in, in general,

Speaker 2:          55:08          one of the coolest things I got to do in government, uh, his work with the then secretary of state on the first big speech that anybody in the u s government had ever given on the topic of Internet freedom. And in that speech we made a really important point. Uh, this was back in when I was a speech writer. That technology itself is neutral, but we're not and we have an obligation to harness these technologies as best we're able to benefit society. Blockchain is no different in that regard. It's got immense potential to do good things as we've talked about today, but it can also be misused in a wide range of applications. And we've seen a fair amount of that already. Uh, so I think the two sides of this, the first is ironically, even the u s government is pretty enthusiastic about the potential for blockchain technology because they understand that again, done right.

Speaker 2:          56:03          This could be the end of friction. Uh, if you think of all the little nuisances that make our lives more complicated and expensive, this if you carry it to which its logical conclusion and spaces like identity and a finance could wipe away a lot of those obstacles that, uh, you know, make our lives a little bit cumbersome. So they see the potential on a lot of governments realize that potential. Uh, ultimately it's up to those of us who've taken the time to understand the technology and that's still a very small universe of people, uh, to try to steer it in ways that it will be used. Well. Um, but you know, the, the point you make is, is really important. We need to get to a stage quickly, uh, where we can demonstrate real value for society. And that's what we're working on. Happy to discuss further as well. Good question.

Speaker 7:          56:52          Uh, so my question was, um, mostly about bitcoin miners and the reason they mined bitcoin is because it's financially that's the incentive that they get much of it kind of the end of it. Um, as time goes on, the benefits of mining bitcoin are going to decrease. So how is this problem being soldered? Um, that's basically it.

Speaker 2:          57:15          Important question. Uh, so the, the context on this, which I imagine will be familiar to most of you is that the reason this vast network of data centers exists is because about every 10 minutes as a new block of information is locked in. Uh, the data center that does that work is rewarded with 12 and a half bitcoin, which now is $200,000 or something like that. So it's a strong incentive to secure the network. Uh, the number of bitcoin that will be awarded will decrease in time to a point where, you know, out in the next century it dwindles to almost not that there are transaction fees on bitcoin transactions that should compensate for much of that decline. Um, the other thing is we are seeing bitcoin become more and more valuable. So even though the number of bitcoin that will be awarded to the miners, the data center operators will decrease the value of those bitcoin at least if the last couple of weeks are any indication is likely to increase. Uh, and so between those two factors, the transaction fees and, and the value increase, uh, there should be strong incentives to continue securing the network for a very long time to come.

Speaker 7:          58:33          Would a crash bring things to a halt because it's no longer profitability?

Speaker 2:          58:38          Um, so long as people are using the technology, uh, again, the transaction fees are such, there are good incentives at the moment, uh, for the data centers to continue doing what they're doing. Uh, it's something that people will want to continue paying attention to. Uh, but for the time being, it has all the makings of a very resilient network.

Speaker 1:          58:58          Alright. Yeah. Thank you so much. This was extremely, extremely interesting and useful and informative. I want to thank you again for joining us and coming and yeah, the best of luck with your efforts. Um, spreading the word.

Speaker 2:          59:16          Thank you. It's, it's an exciting space and, uh, you know, for all of you here and watching both for the blockchain trust accelerator and the Global Blockchain Business Council, uh, we're always looking for great partners and great challenge. And hopefully we'll get a chance to collaborate in some of these efforts down the road.

Speaker 8:          59:34          [inaudible].
