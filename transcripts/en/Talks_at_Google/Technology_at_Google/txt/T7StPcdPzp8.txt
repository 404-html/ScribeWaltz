Speaker 1:          00:05          Oh, welcome to toxic Google today. It is a great privilege to be able to introduce Dr. Joseph Ashbacher of the Europe European Space Agency where he directs their program on Earth observation. He's going to speak to us about the big picture from space, from pixels to knowledge. Um, he has led from the very beginning starting in 1998, the Copernicus program, which is a set of multiple satellite missions that have become the most, I would say, audacious, ambitious, comprehensive set of earth observation missions ever created, going out with plan launches to 20, 30 systematically monitoring the entire global set of land, ocean and atmosphere. And the goal is to derive benefit for society, humanitarian applications, climate environment, crisis response. And uh, I hope he will speak to us about those things. Um, it involves a huge amount of data. I think, uh, they're coordinating delivery of data from upwards of 30 satellites, delivering an excess of 10 petabytes of data each year.

Speaker 1:          01:17          Um, we have a cooperation going on now where that data is coming off those satellites and going into the Google earth engine platform. By the way, I should introduce myself. I'm Rebecca Moore. I lead the Google Earth Google earth engine projects here at Google and it's beautiful data that they're producing. Uh, doctor Ashbacher is Austrian. He has more than 35 years of professional experience in Earth observation with a technical background in the natural sciences. And really the essence of, of his leadership of Copernicus is to shape a future of our planet that will benefit all of us. So please join me in welcoming Dr Osh Barker.

Speaker 2:          02:05          Okay, so good afternoon. Uh, my name is Joseph Ashbacher and thank you very much for the do introduce me. I'm from the European Space Agency. European Space Agency is well known all over the world. You probably know NASA, but Isa is the equivalent in your hopper dop and space agency doing a lot of activities in the various domains of space. I'm very glad to be here today. Thank you for inviting me because I really would like to send to you some of the data which we are producing and how this data are being used for everyday life and how they can really help make our planet a better place. Uh, let me start with one slide, which is really showing space, the final frontier. All of you know, a spaceship enterprise. You have all been very fanatically watching it, including myself. And this is really symbolizing that we are at the edge of what can be done and at the age of, of uh, what, uh, we want to achieve as, as mankind, but also to explore your domains not only in outer space but also in terms of knowledge, in terms of technology, which we are doing with, uh, as part of our daily work.

Speaker 2:          03:13          So what do you see here is an image of our planet earth. They can buy Rosetta and the Rosetta may be known to you as the satellite, which was flying to a faraway comment. Our, which was a releasing a sound are called filet, which was lending on the commit and actually taking measurements. The satellite was taking measurements around the comet and the lender of the comedy itself. 500 million kilometers away from our earth. Uh, this, uh, satellite was working. However, his image was taken much closer. In fact, the satellite had to fly around the earth to make the slingshot movements to get throughout the space. Uh, in this case, a 630,000 kilometers where he took an image or the satellite, took an image backup our planet earth just to show that we are having a very unique vantage point on space in order to look at our planet.

Speaker 2:          04:10          But in the European Space Agency, we also working on other elements, not only outer space and exploring new planets, but also in different domains. We actually one of the few based agencies worldwide next to NASA and the very few others who are covering all the domains from orchids, uh, to an education systems, the telecommunication, human space, flight and earth observation, which is the domain I'm heading at the European Space Agency. Uh, what is Isa? Isa Is composed of 22 member states or countries in Europe at our members and our funding our programs and making decisions on how the money's being spent, uh, with uh, uh, in, in dop, nurse space agency. We also have cooperating states, last Canada who are having agreements with us on a longterm basis in order to work on some of these space projects. And the way we usually function or organize our funding is that we are proposing our member states, uh, proposal, uh, which may be attractive to them or not because it is a voluntary contribution they give to our programs.

Speaker 2:          05:15          It is not a subscription by GNP or other means. We are making a proposal to our member states and if they like the activity we are doing it put money into the pot and they participate in the program. This is a very unique way of how we're doing it. Meaning that we have to compete for money, for ideas in order to really, uh, and our outcomes which we are doing. We also create inspiration for future explorers. And this is of course, uh, the nature of space. It is that a, it really inspires you and creates a, your imagination and shows what can be possible. In this case, we are having a regularly open days in our facility in [inaudible], which is close to home. And, uh, we inviting young kids, we show them movies. The astronauts are coming. And as you see, they can get very excited in the, uh, seeing what, uh, what can be done at what I'm doing in particular in my directorate is building satellites and methodologies, how to monitor our planet.

Speaker 2:          06:18          And there we share a great vision together with Google earth engine, with also looking at the planet, uh, using its capacities to computing power. You really make good use of information in order to better understand how the planet is being or, or what happens on the planet, how it can be better managed and really derive information for decision makers, but for the general public to make a awareness of what the state of our planet is. So what do you see here on this graph is the activities of the directorate of Earth Observation on one child. Uh, these are the lines of satellites which we are operating and developing at the moment. We have 28 satellites that are being under development in our order book, which is actually the largest number ever, uh, which we have. We are operating currently 12 satellites. And all of these are rather substantial satellites are where a lot of r and D is being invested in order to have ideas, measurements.

Speaker 2:          07:16          You see the three circles here on the left hand side, the green circle or the green orbit, which underlines the science missions. So really satellites which are addressing questions of science. And we are developing cutting edge technology in order to address these questions of science to answer some very important points which are being raised by the scientific community. Let's take an example, a climate change. We are, scientists have asked us to monitor closely what is the extent of ice coverage, not only the extent of ice coverage, but the volume of ice on the polar regions. And what is the change over time. And we have developed a satellite which is doing exactly that. The Monitor regularly ice coverage, uh, on a daily basis. So come to orbit is the compound Nico's orbit, which is um, um, which are symbolizes those satellites, which we call sentinels, uh, that are monitoring the planet through the [inaudible] program.

Speaker 2:          08:15          The [inaudible] program is a newer program within the agency, but the very substantive one, uh, because we are doing this with the European Union, we serve who has declared formally Kapernick who as one of the two flagship programs in Europe and together European Commission, European Union with the European Commission and European Space Agency. We are developing developing a suite of satellites which are monitoring the planet from various angles with various instruments that would explain that a bit more in detail in a minute. And then the right hand side, we have the pathology missions where we are building together with Eumetsat, which is the equivalent of Noah in hub, uh, satellites for weather, weather monitoring, but observations both in geostationary orbit and impala orbiting Orbitz in order to really see the various aspects of climate, part of weather and climate parameters

Speaker 2:          09:10          knocking off a space and observation, observing the earth. This is a very good example of the very first image. It's a typo satellite, which is a US satellite, which did Monte told the earth in 1960 on the 1st of April. Uh, the satellite was taking this first elevation, a picture from space. You see the New York Times article, which is referring to it as really a new era in mythology, which has started with this launch of the satellite a few years later. Now we also having a satellites observing earth for climate and weather purposes. Uh, here are some examples that are measuring and observing constantly, uh, the state of, of cloud coverage. But those other by the parameters to both [inaudible] which is the geostationary satellite and, uh, met doc, which are the polar orbiting satellites which are going on updating the wider services with this type of information.

Speaker 2:          10:15          What do you see here is a very good example of how set the lights work in daily life. In this case, you see a superstorm Sandy, uh, well known in the United States. I was actually a storm that costs quite a few tents off. Uh, I showed this a first in the Caribbean that you see at the bottom, the start of a superstorm Sandy, the storm. Then when those votes and at some point of time, a mythological service is expected that the strobe would, um, uh, towards, uh, to the east and therefore not cause a danger for the Washington New York area. Uh, however, as you see the actual costs of the store, which is on the right hand side, showed that the superstorm sandy went into the north eastern part of the American continent and Willie cost again damage. I'd also Keisha this at this point of time of interest is the image in the middle which shows these values are lines and different colors, which are your forecasts off the, uh, off the path of the storm a few days in advance.

Speaker 2:          11:27          So in this case, a 9.5 days in advance and you see that, uh, that was a wide variety of where the story will end up. A Benny few actually indicated that he turns her again towards the West, towards the continent and therefore would cause with cause some damage. And this of course was that predicted, uh, quite well. Um, in, uh, uh, addiction occula see satellites were used and could 6.5 days in advance at the storm actually would turn left and right and therefore some measures, but they can in order to improve that. I should probably also say that in global by the forecast or if you look outside and you hear that the weather tomorrow is Sunday or stormy satellites today are the major data source or forecast accuracy. If you take all the measurements, put together what we call in situ, which is measurements on the ground in the atmosphere with radio songs, uh, by boats, by airplanes, uh, those measurements which we call in situ measurements. I bought one third of the forecast accuracy, added two thirds come from satellites of various nature. I think this is a underlining and highlighting how important Saturday have become power daily life.

Speaker 3:          12:41          Yeah.

Speaker 2:          12:42          Another example of where satellites are really useful is climate monitoring and monitoring the state of our environment. What you see here is the Paris conference, which was adopting the Paris agreement, uh, which was a milestone in a climate monitoring but, uh, expressed by the political community who have been committing to preserve the planet. And a, this was a very important moment and we have committed ourselves as European space agency to use our satellites in support of climate monitoring.

Speaker 2:          13:14          Some of these satellites are shown here. The sentinel satellites, the cofounder Cosentino satellites are grouped in five or six different families. Uh, they are, uh, using different instruments on board, on the radar to optical imagery, the larger scale, a wider, uh, scale, uh, measurements of oceans on the land surface is a to atmospheric Trey's house gases. So you see here on the left hand side, a sentinel one a, which is a center that provides and meter resolution in the radar domain central to have very uh, much used because it has a, an instrument on board with 13 or channels, a spectral channels that can measure the earth state on a regular basis, like a camera in the visible, a domain of the electromagnetic spectrum, but also in the name of it and short wave infrared, which gives information on the state of agitation for example, but also many other parameters sent in a three s three installments and bought again for large scale monitoring of oceans and uh, and uh, landmasses a betters parameters. I will show a few examples in a minute and sending a spawned five atmospheric gases that are of course at the source of global bombing and define the changing climate.

Speaker 3:          14:35          Yeah.

Speaker 2:          14:36          So what we do with the satellites is really measuring the earth's system, different parameters that are all interconnected, uh, measure various elements of our, of our planet. Here we see the example of chlorophyll, sea level height, sea surface temperature. Knight was oxide, oxide, carbon dioxide. So moisture, but there are also many other parameters which we are measuring on a regular basis with uh, with the satellites. What I'm showing here is actually a complicated graph and I'm not going to explain all these lines, but there are two messages I would like you to take with you on looking at this. Uh, at this graph here. The first message is that, uh, the different colors are showing different families of sentinels, meaning different observation technologies, which are really providing measurements of all the parameters of the, of the globe, uh, which are the atmosphere, the oceans, a polar regions, uh, uh, which are uh, a system, a system together.

Speaker 2:          15:36          And the various sensors which we have put on the set on the sentinels are observing that is out of the services. The second message is it long continuous lines in this case up to 2027, but I could have this graph showing up to 2040 and he would still see that these measurements are taking place over long periods of time. And this is one of the most important features of the compound Nicos Program that we are committing ourselves. We have satellites that provide these measurements basically forever. Meaning that after one generation is coming to the end of its life and next generation will be flown in space of course with improved the sensors and instruments and this will be followed by another generation to really a continuous measurement, serious of observations, which of course is crucial for anyone to really passed in this data. Take them up and use them in the long term.

Speaker 2:          16:28          Sentinel one, uh, one of the sentinels which is measuring various parameters shown here in an artistic impression or it has a uh, a way that instrument as the maintenance torment or you see her also do solar panels. But the way that installment is working in [inaudible] and taking images of the earth day and night independent of weather conditions because radar goes through the atmosphere, even if it's clouded, even if it is a rainy even at night and you can get data of this area. I'm showing now a few examples of what can be measured with these way down images, which are a bit unusual compared to optical images of which you are probably more used to. This is a a way dot image showing or different radar images showing. Uh, the changes of our co-op's are of lights. Cops are in, uh, uh, the Vietnam area.

Speaker 2:          17:17          Uh, and what you see here, the different colors is different states of uh, of the planting cycle which allow you to read three for yield of including also some, some other information or you see here are written on the slide that this was a, um, a case where we had an El Nino effect. That means some, uh, changes in our global a global system. And we got a loss of the rice yield of about 16% between two years, 2015, 2016 based, uh, due to the effects of El Nino, which costs financial damage, but also people who have been suffering from this El Nino effect. I or not having the food security are required,

Speaker 2:          18:02          not the example of what is radar data can do. And this is quite unique is measuring deformations of the surface itself. You see here an image of Mexico City, you see the red areas, which are areas that have actually sank in that have been reduced in terms of surface height, uh, to, to uh, water, uh, which was expected from underground drinking water, uh, water for other purposes. And do you see here that uh, in one month up to 2.5 centimeters, one inch, uh, was actually the change of height. This was done over three months. Uh, so in three months you had three inches of a change or 7.5 centimeters of change in the surface level, uh, in the city of Mexico, almost not believable. I didn't really happen that buildings and all the structure above was thinking in quite significantly as an effect of this. I, it's also just a pacing and you can make sure this, I'm space, our satellites fly in 800 kilometers altitude and you can measure accuracies of changes in the fractures in the order of millimeters, which is quite astonishing using a technology called interferometry.

Speaker 2:          19:15          And the same technology has been, uh, used recently. You see here an example of a California highway number one hour before and after on the left side, before under the right send after the landslide, which was destroying the highway, but also the sounding area. It's happened on May 24th, 2017 and the analyses of the satellite image shows in the right areas that this is the area which was actually thinking in. And you can measure how many centimeters are, how many inches are these changes have been made or you see here very clearly that I, the extreme cases to have been two meters, uh, off, uh, changes in height. You do this a landslide.

Speaker 3:          19:57          Okay.

Speaker 2:          19:58          But Isa is not only would using sentinel satellites but also other satellites which are walk yet for scientific use and which are addressing some very key questions of science. What do you see here are those are what we call earth explorers that have been launched so far. You'll see ya. Gotcha. Uh, which is on the left hand side, s Moss, a Kiowa south and small. But that would show some of the examples of this, of the use of this data. Right now, coach here, uh, which is so measuring did you eat of the earth is actually having on board a very highly high position radiometer, which he is so emotionally engaged with the changes or the cabinetry field of the earth. You see here the earth rotating, you might assume earthy, sir around a ball, uh, is as a round shape. It does not. It actually looks like a potato.

Speaker 2:          20:55          If you consider the uh, the gravitational, uh, field of, uh, of, of, of the planet and the satellite has actually provided the most accurate a guy with the measurements or ever flown in space. It has the ob did in the meanwhile, I it was launched in 2009 and it had a control to, again, I'm the stop, uh, 2013, uh, which, uh, um, by it measured actually while it was descending a, again with high accuracy of these parameters. You also see that the satellite is quite unusual compared to others who may have seen it looks almost like an airplane. It has wings because it was flying at a much lower altitude compared to others, which was required to make these measurements.

Speaker 3:          21:40          Yeah.

Speaker 2:          21:40          Now the example is a s a s mos stands for soil moisture and ocean salinity, uh, which is a satellite that is measuring these two parameters. So moisture over the land surfaces and ocean salinity of ocean surfaces. What'd you see here? The uh, you see software salinity values over a period of time. You see the months are on the right hand bottom of animation and you see very clearly there are some areas where which are more salty and others are less salty. The blue means a, it is more freshwater, so less lower salinity and the means higher salinity areas which have a very high rainfall for example in the topic, uh, everywhere. Uh, the water from the clouds are less halted as compared to other areas which are, for example, further up north.

Speaker 3:          22:34          Yeah.

Speaker 2:          22:35          Another example of these measurements, our measurements by our ice satellite, which is measuring extent but also volume of the ice coverage. Uh, you see here the ice volume and mass balance. Our measurements as they are taken by io site satellite. Yeah. In the case of Greenland. And you'll see the capability for loss of volume, uh, off, uh, Greenland over a couple of years, which are regularly updated with the satellite. And I should also say that, uh, for many years scientists have actually been arguing if not fighting, whether there's an increase or decrease of the mass balance of ice in Greenland. And this was a question which for extra d quite a few years or I was disputed a until NASA and esa half put together yes. Science teams and all the satellite observations which they have with that set the lights but also other means on ground and otherwise and have come, uh, hyper.

Speaker 2:          23:31          I've compared, uh, uh, data sets and have clearly found out that there is a net mass balance loss, meaning there's a melting which takes place. However, in some of the areas there is actually also an of mass, especially in the central parts of Queensland. For example, in here in this, uh, diagram, which is on a different, uh, uh, satellite measurements serious from central one. I did also show us very clearly by different measurements taken over time, our way or the mass flows. The ice flows actually take place. You've seen in the middle, uh, the bluish areas which are indicating that there's a slight increase of Moscow of course towards the edges. Uh, the snow and the ice are melting and the flowing towards the coastline.

Speaker 2:          24:21          Another mission which is actually quite a challenge for us is um, the uh, uh, a lidar, a mission or called [inaudible], which is using a huge, a lighter instrument on board. You see it in this big home or the satellite of a laser or light. A beam comes out in the ultraviolet and we'll measure when it is launched in about a half a year's time, we'll measure wind speed, wind direction in a three dimensional field in cloud for the atmosphere. Because the Lidar, the laser beam is actually reflected on the molecules, the particulates in the atmosphere and the element is coming back to the satellite. And those elements coming back through the velocity of the satellite allows you to replete in three dimensions. Actually, this is a technology which is not existing at all today. Um, we had, uh, some technical hurdles to overcome because it is a completely new, unique technology which we are developing here as part of our R and d activities.

Speaker 2:          25:24          At some point in time our engineers got stuck and couldn't figure out some of the issues that were, uh, stopping some of the work we did called NASA, uh, for help. Uh, NASA said, no, no, we are not working on this. This is too challenging, but you figure it out. Please tell us how we used to have department because it is something we would like to do as well. So we are, I'm knocking on wood, we are looking forward to this measurements. They will be really unique. And I think something that our user community, in this case, meteorologists or the forecasting services really need to have.

Speaker 2:          26:01          So global challenges on a changing planet. Is this really something that concerns have we won? I'm not the only other space agencies, but really every single citizen on this globe. We are working a lot in this domain. Are you see here the Sdgs, the sustainable development goals as they have been approved by the UN system, uh, which I indicating a number of goals, targets and indicators which are important in order to preserve our planet. Uh, you see some blue ticks on the boxes. These are the ones where space can help providing critical measurements. And we are doing this, we're setting up a program that will address many of these indicators, uh, with the means of satellites in order to, uh, really, uh, understand the state of the planet but also help improving its state. One example is her urbanization. Uh, you see here a Shanghai, an image taken in 1975 in 1990 in 2000. I need 2010. And you see how happy lady city was evolving. What do you see in red color? Here is the hilltop area. So basically, really the area which was a changing over the last few days very rapidly. And this is typically one of the parameters that can be measured from space.

Speaker 3:          27:19          Okay.

Speaker 2:          27:19          Another measurement we are taking very important, very critical, is a c level of ice. We all know, um, newspapers on TV at the urban change is costing among other things an increase in temperature but also an increased. So Sea level, sea level height, uh, which has been recorded here. Uh, Tim's a thousand, since 1700, uh, over several hundred years already based on measurements. And uh, they called on the surface and you'll see this window here, which is the window when satellite started taking very precise measurements of sea level changes. And then on the right hand side you see the future projections, future projections, meaning depending on how much your global change, we accept how much temperature increases we have in which direction this curve we go. And uh, you see, first of all, the curves all point upwards, which is scary. Uh, but also the variation is quite high, meaning that it depends a lot on how mankind in total, we'll behave over the next years.

Speaker 2:          28:21          Uh, in order to decide what did we on the upper curve, in the middle curve, on the lower curve. And of course we hope we are on the lower curve because that would be the low impact. But what you also see on the right hand side is that, uh, this is a curve of sea level rise, which is going up very clearly measured from space in this case with very independent means. We see here over the last 20 years that the sea level on average, most of icing about three millimeters per year, three millimeters may not sound a lot, but if it's 10 years, 20 years, 100 years, it is a very, uh, important amount of sea level of eyes, of course, leading to some areas that will be flooded, small islands in the Pacific, a disappearing some cities on the coastline. So being on the water and not any believable. And I described a difficult imagine that this will actually happen, but it is measured and it will be happening. Uh, no doubt.

Speaker 2:          29:20          Same. Oh shown here against sea level rise on the left hand side, uh, sea surface temperature on the item side. Uh, these are measurements which her, which have been taken by satellites. First of all, do you see that the sea level is not only changing on average across the globe, but has a very strong local variations? A does of course depend the weather. Uh, on barriers, a ocean circulation element are you see, for example, very clearly the Gulf stream off of I'm Florida water, your hub, which has this red blue carbons, which is having a very large change of sea level, uh, of sea level, uh, along along its way. Awesome. A surface temperature, sea surface temperature on the right hand side. Also changing accordingly depending on weather, depending on atmosphere, ocean circulation and a number of parameters.

Speaker 2:          30:14          Other parameters we are measuring or regularly with our satellites are the extent of ice coverage. In this case, the Arctic. I this actually very interesting to see how over the years and you see the scale at the bottom, the extent, the maximum extent of ice cover, uh, is really changing. It is known on this is not surprising that different windows or different years, hefty, different extents are some, a book holds about Lesser Colton, uh, the previous one. But there's one clear trend and you see it here that the further you go, uh, forward in the scale, the world's 2000, 2010, the less ice coverage you have in the polar regions. And, uh, this leads already and even boy and a future to some areas being icefree, which used to be covered by ice, uh, which has of course, huge impact for many, many elements for climate parameters, but also ship voting. For example. Uh, you can for example, here go from Europe, Japan, you were saying the north eastern acid, uh, meaning, uh, going, uh, north, the Arctic area instead of all the way around in Africa and all the way to Japan, which of course is much longer and therefore has a much more expensive, I do dot. That's also threatening environment in the ecosystem in this areas because ships are suddenly costing this area, which did not cause the area before.

Speaker 2:          31:39          So all this is really showing how sad, what satellites can measure, uh, and how they can be used. So what do we do in European Space Agency? But this is happening everywhere. Especially also he'd Google, uh, that, uh, the space data are being combined with all other assets. So ICT, uh, s uh, to other information which are becoming a available in order to reduce inflammation, which is very relevant but also integrated in into all levels of society and therefore really being used for everything on a daily scale. You see here a bit the scale from uh, a space 1.0 to 2.0 3.0 towards 4.0, but you would also know as new space where you combine these various elements.

Speaker 2:          32:24          What are these elements? What do you see here? A new actors that suddenly came, uh, came to life and, uh, were introduced in the space domain which did not exist before and have not been there before. One of them very prominently Google. Google has been very active also in the satellite to Maine with the Terra Bella. But, uh, this have been uh, sold. But with the Google Earth and Chin are, um, are checked or Paul Graham really would using an information source which will be of global value for everyone. Not only decision makers, but everyone, uh, to provide up to date, uh, satellite based information for various purposes, but also other players are coming, uh, coming, uh, on the surface. Uh, we have planet not far from here. We have spire not far from here who are building constellations of hundreds of satellites, which we didn't, didn't have until a very few years ago.

Speaker 2:          33:20          Uh, so that the landscape is really changing very drastically in our domain. And this affects us all, uh, public organizations like European Space Agency, but also private organizations which are making good use of this data. And we are determined to really interact very closely for the benefit of, uh, of, uh, the community. So what are we doing as Isa do respond to these global challenges? We have organized actually or seminar, um, in May, 2017 in fact, Scotty at European space agencies eScreen facility near home in Italy, and we've invited some of the leading experts in this new space, two maids. In those domains, where are the biggest changes? The fastest changes are happening. We have invited two types of people. One, uh, one group of people are CEOs or leaders in building new constellations, satellite constellations with tens or hundreds of satellites that are coming up. Another group of people who are working with this data and converting them into information using ICT technology.

Speaker 2:          34:28          And you see here the bottom hole on the right hand side, a new El colleague, former Google earth engine who was one of our key speakers. And uh, him together with these colleagues, they're really showing us how fast these developments are going. Uh, what is happening in the world. And I have to say that our community has been really woken up by this presentation. So it was actually something that was a smaller revolution, at least in Europe, uh, to see how fast this development go and, uh, what has to be done in order to remain, to remain relevant and to interact with these communities. Uh, the event itself was a live podcast or we had several tens of thousands of viewers, uh, not only the people sitting in the home, but, uh, uh, people watching the movies either life or afterwards. And this created quite a quite some interest which also showed to us that we have to move and we have to act in order to, uh, to stay on top of it and to connect with these communities.

Speaker 2:          35:31          Uh, what we have done, and this is something which is more, um, specific to Esop, but it goes way beyond the czar. I have created something called the field lab fee for the Greek letter fee or like an English accent annunciation. We call it fire lab, uh, which is uh, uh, an open space concept where you invite people with different expertise, with different assets, bring them together, work on a project, and then bring this expertise or this knowledge back home to their company, to the institution in order to work on specific problems. I'm inviting Google, but also many other partners to come with us. Spent six months, one year or longer or shorter and identify a project. Let me take an example. Uh, today in, at least in, in Asia, we are not yet using artificial intelligence for the analysis of satellite images. But we know from other domains that this is an area where huge progress is made.

Speaker 2:          36:29          Uh, Google is one of the key players in this domain, but there are quite a few are very active, a very prominent, uh, companies are working on this. We know that this technology will be very useful, uh, for satellite images. They cloud covers one example, automatic detection of cloud cover, but also some features related to agriculture, forestry to archeology. Too many parameters which you can see satellite images, the huge amounts of data we are producing require that uh, uh, artificial intelligence would really help in identity in, in identifying some of these key features. Of course it always needs to human intelligence, but, uh, because the volumes are so huge, uh, it does also is, it is also required that we need to apply. This means, and this is one example of where we could say a Google with artificial intelligence Isa with with its knowledge or for of satellite data interpretation and the access to its data firsthand because we produce a sending the data could work extremely well together and develop algorithms, methods in order to help, uh, developing methods to plan, to save our planet or to preserve our planet with information which we provide.

Speaker 2:          37:40          And that would hope that this is something that would not only put a mirror to us what happens in technology development, but also to society and show them how fast our planet is changing and what has to be done in order to surf it, which then leads to decisions that are actually leading to a preservation of our planet. Another example, which we are initiating now in terms of addressing some of these issues is to together with European Commission, uh, define a new satellite or we call it sentinel seven, which would measure carbon dioxide, but at the scale where you can really see where it comes from, a in order to have a more accurate understanding of the sources. And therefore also what can be done to reduce or minimize the sources or do you see here as a, an animation, a simulation which does not yet exist from space, but it shows how such a satellite constellation could work at.

Speaker 2:          38:36          You really can see where are the sources of emissions, how do they, uh, transport through the atmosphere, how did it mix up with other gasses and what is the whole dynamics of greenhouse gases and how it works. And this of course, it would be extremely relevant information in the context of, uh, of the Paris agreement in the context of global climate change. Actually in the context of really seeing what happens to our planet. And this is something we would like to pursue. A do a build up such a constellation, a pub, you have three satellites at the beginning, uh, in order to provide these measurements. Uh, I dealt with the invasive, what'd you see on the right hand side is actually the measurement of carbon dioxide. A, they have been made by a fiscal various sources in this case from 2002 to 2016. Uh, but the curve is a very, as a very clear trend, the very clear direction it goes upwards.

Speaker 2:          39:29          And, uh, we need to contain this development, but also information from space has to be useful for everyone. Or it has to go into devices which you use every day. Mobile phones, tablets a, for example, equality, sunshine, adulation, a smart farming values. Users should use this data in an integrated fashion of not only, uh, using information from space, but combining it with other data, without the measurements and with models in order to really make it a daily asset, uh, daily. Uh, commodity, which people use just as you are better, better forecast or any other information you get on your mobile phones, you also supporting a APP camps, hackathon's these type of things. But I'm also showing this is image here because [inaudible] plex is a here seen from sentinel to which you've known better where it is, but it's somebody at the center of, of this image.

Speaker 2:          40:24          But Google actually spreads out or a much larger area. And this is one example of, uh, of the satellite data showing the Salvia here foresight or do we want to go, what do we think is a way where, uh, the use of satellites will end up? And this is one example which shows her what we call a control hall for spaceship Earth. It brings us back to the beginning of the talk, right? We said that you earth is a spaceship and uh, we are working at the frontier of, um, of exploration and I think we should establish a system that monitors the key parameters up our planet, uh, in order to understand first of all what happens, but also to provide this awareness and information with decision makers in order to make, to do everything in order to preserve our planet. And with this, I want to thank you very much for attention and I'm happy to answer any questions you may have.

Speaker 3:          41:20          [inaudible]

Speaker 4:          41:28          are there any missions that you've not planned yet that you think would have a big impact or that you wish in your own heart

Speaker 2:          41:33          that you could do? Yes, there are a number of missions. They, I met that many more missions then, uh, then we have money. But there is in fact what we do is we are testing a new methods or new technologies and that we are, we are developing new mission concepts or we are having an internal catalog of some 50 of those missions are, which really go across the whole of ancient, some of them I've shown carbon dioxide as one of the next challenges are, which are we want to develop. But there are also other missions that are using, for example, a hyperspectral channels as we call them, which is not only 10 channels are, are, uh, of, uh, of an immature but maybe handle it. So even several hundreds of of these channels to have a very accurate, uh, distinction of the electromagnetic spectrum and understand, understand extremely well what happens on each year.

Speaker 2:          42:23          A place of the wavelength in order to have a better distinction between agricultural crops are used for mining, different rock types and, and so on. We've got a much better or knowledge of the, uh, of, of, of the, of the measurement on the surface. But there are many applications, are many ideas which we have, uh, in order to, to measure various parameters. I think one trend is, is clear, uh, uh, people would like more and more up to date information, uh, of the state of the whole planet and all the parameters of the planet. And this is really an information they want frequently. Uh, we used to have satellite images once every couple of weeks or maybe even months depending on, on what the data were. And I think, uh, the population that really wants to see a continuous evolution of what happens almost every day or even shorter than this within the day of certain parameters. That's certainly a trend, which is also very strong.

Speaker 5:          43:17          Uh, so you talked a little bit about, or you alluded to, companies like planet and spire that are launching constellations of small spacecraft. Uh, but the, um, uh, the roadmap for the Copernicus that you talked about, uh, is still primarily oriented around launching large satellite civic traditional story. How do you see a miniaturization of a space technology and privatization of space technology changing how organizations and like he said, do your own business, uh, in the decades ahead.

Speaker 2:          43:48          And this is an extremely good question and that actually it's the main reason why have you organized this event I was mentioning before who realize and make people realize what happens, how fast these changes go. And to question if I may, uh, whether the current approach is the one that goes for the next 10, 20, or 30 years or we have to rethink sometimes radically rethink our approach. And this is really at the core of, uh, of the debate we are having. How does our ar, how do a missions that are built by public institutions like Isa, uh, relate to these constellations, uh, which are, uh, have very different nature in terms of satellites and information they provide. My personal opinion is it always need high quality, highly calibrated reference missions, which to private industry may not want to engage because simply they are inexpensive and very complicated, a complex due to build.

Speaker 2:          44:43          And therefore the business case may not be as well as so evident as you might imagine. However, uh, there are gaps to be filled and really gaps meaning in the sense of of embolic acquisitions, acquisitions for example, our sentinels are covering the globe every five days. Uh, we learned from planet that they need, uh, information every day or even within the day. Uh, so very frequent observations. Therefore they are closing a time gap, but they're also improving the resolution. Uh, our satellites are having 10 meters solution with a very wide swath planet. Satellites are going down at the moment, the dose, three to four meters. But, uh, the newer generations skysat below one meter. And this is something which is a, an a complimentary information. And, uh, personally I think the combination of these publicly funded reference missions and privately funded or mission. So constellations is extremely useful and I think there's a lot of work to be done in order to integrate those data sets and use them together.

Speaker 6:          45:46          So you showed a slide with the whole constellation of sensors, the current and into the future. And I think the concern is that with that volume of data will be uh, you know, drowning in data, thirsty for knowledge. Where do you see the role of space agencies, NASA East said Jaxa in bridging that gap. And do you think that's a proper role for these agencies or is that more of an academic and or private sector activity?

Speaker 2:          46:18          Okay, then I said, well, um, aspects of this question, which is actually a very, a very relevant one. Uh, today we are producing are extremely high volumes of, of data. Um, actually the sentinel program is the third largest user of data in the world to express it in more common terms. The amount of data we would use every day with our sentinels is more than all the photos, all the videos uploaded on Facebook every day. So it's huge amounts of data which we are managing and which we are producing and we need to help offer our larger ICT companies, Google and others to really make good use of these data. The data itself is of course fantastic because they provide the baseline of the observations. But the real value is converting this data and information and this is where a company's coming, commercial companies in particular, we convert this or this data into information.

Speaker 2:          47:13          And this for me would be one of the biggest challenges, uh, in the years to come to do, to manage this massive amount of data. It's not enough just to screen them. You need a automatic methods, artificial intelligence, but also other methods in order to really make good use of use. I'm coming from Australia and maybe uh, I take a small anecdote of mortality, well known decision and he at some point was looking at a piece of, uh, of a compensation of one of his competitor or fellow musicians. And he was looking at it. He said, there are too many notes. This is too many data. Too many notes. It don't make sense. They don't sound good. The trick is, or the challenges to pick out the right notes with them and the right place and make a nice melody. And that's what he did. And I think we have the same problem. We have a lot of data, not saying too many, but a lot of data and picking out the right pieces of information and putting them into context is the challenge of the next years to come there. We need to work a lot altogether and not on the east side. This is a work which you're a space agencies have to do with private industry and with a lot of other partners.

Speaker 7:          48:23          My question is is on a low d technology that's using the satellite requires really deep knowledge like the saw they talk about and hyperspectral and a lot of this requires many years of specialization but two main use of the data more meaningfully. Do you think we need to preach the Tenneco get between the experts and other solvers in ICT? Is we're more comfortable with maybe like machine learning, artificial intelligence, but might not have the knowledge to exploit the data generated by these satellites? Yeah,

Speaker 2:          48:57          a very good point. Um, I think there are different types of answers to your question because there is some data which can easily be integrated using, I would say computing power. If you take a, uh, an imaging sensor and you compare changes before and after, you can easily see a difference between one day and another, uh, simply because, uh, forest area has been deforested or a building has been built or something happened and you can easily detected, I would say almost automatically with ICT technology and this is maybe the simpler case, but there will be a lot which you can do with relatively simple means, uh, in using this data, there's other, uh, use of this data which requires very high knowledge expertise. I showed some of the examples before our, what we call interferometry, uh, that you can detect actually changes in height at the surface. And there you need really the expertise of, uh, of remote sensing or Earth observation expert in order to interpret, to calculate, interpret this data. So it, it needs a combination of both. Like always, if you really want to maximize the use of these data, you need the expertise. In one side, but also the means on the other side and the means. In this case it's really ICT.

Speaker 1:          50:10          So I notice the focus on where all the effort is monitoring planet has been largely Europe and North America focused both the state agencies and the private sector. Um, how much do we need other parts of the world to get engaged and how much does it matter given that the satellites are actually global?

Speaker 2:          50:31          That's to say a satellites are global by nature. So a satellite doesn't only stay over America or what you hope over certain country is circling down to earth and therefore really take images of the whole globe. So by nature, it's a global issue which requires all departments. Uh, I think, um, I think one good example or where we should really underlines that you need everyone, uh, or the major players to work together a tech CEO to carbon dioxide measurements, which is not an isolated problem because, so if you pollute here and don't pollute their, uh, it's no good because if the pollution goes from here to there and therefore, uh, the effect of the clean country or clean area, it's not working because the pollution comes from [inaudible], which transports it. So you need the, the, the various countries or regions to work together. Uh, even if you have to say is we want to be pioneers in measuring a CEO to, for example, to better understand the flux is in the atmosphere and to see what are the impacts on climate change. It's not enough. You hope you sir, small piece on the, on the whole globe. And it requires everyone. And that's why we really want to engage with all the major space nations, with Jaxa, with Japanese, with the Chinese, with America, our European partners, to create a global system because only a global system is really something that is sustainable and make sense?

Speaker 1:          51:53          Hmm. I think we were all very inspired by the vision you articulated in the commitment coming out of Europe, the European Space Agency, to monitoring the planet going out decades for the benefit of all of us at a time when it is critically important. So my question for you is, it's more personal when you're turning these pixels to knowledge. Some of that knowledge is rather dark, that is discovered, melting, polarize desertification, you know, loss of air quality, uh, all sorts of issues. How do you maintain, can you maintain optimism for yourself and your 500 plus person team in the face of, of all this?

Speaker 2:          52:33          Um, indeed, it's toward that. Sometimes you, when you monitor closely the state and evolution of our planet, the news is no good news. Uh, because of you see how it degrades, how it, uh, uh, it is being destroyed. How the pollution affects various elements, how climate change increases temperature increases, c level of ice increases. I'm told them this is no good news on the other side of our planet is so beautiful. And we once had an exhibition where we put together some of our sentinel satellite images mostly from Sentinel's but not only and have put them on the ball. Uh, and uh, the, the title of this exhibition was beauty and fragility of our planet. And it is so to our planet is so beautiful, especially seen from space, but it's also fat child. And I think this fragility is the one that wants you to protect it because at the end it is your living space. It is our living space which we need to protect. So, and to answer your question, yes, there is a lot of dangerous or are, which we all threats which we see every day. However, stepping back, the planet has so much beauty to offer, and I think this is really giving you the optimism you need in order to really enjoy this, uh, looking at these images every day. Thank you very much. Thank you.
