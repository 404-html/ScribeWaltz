Speaker 1:          00:05          Hey everybody. Hi. Thanks for having me. Do you guys have a good lunch? Yeah, me too. I'm telling you I want to work here cause that lunch was awesome. Um, I don't make anything near that. Anyways, my name is Matthew Reinhardt and I make poppop books. Some people call me a paper engineer's, some people call me. I'm a children's book illustrator. I'm, I like to think of myself as all those things and many more. And today I'm going to show you a little bit about, you know, how I do what I do. I'm also going to make a pop up here and show you some things that you can actually make it home to. Um, so let's get started. Say Hello. See, I always have to put notes for myself in these presentations. It helps me a lot. Um, when I'm doing this and I say hello and get started.

Speaker 1:          00:50          So we got that done. All right, very good. All right. So, um, when I was young, I had no idea that there was such a thing as a paper engineer or a pop up book maker, whatever. I was just a kid. I liked to ride bikes, you know, my fashion sense was a little off. Um, but, but I, but I didn't know and you know, you guys are really lucky. Everyone's really lucky to be able to come here and you know, be with your parents and uh, see what they do at work. It's really important as you get older, you get to, you, you get to learn about what things work and what things you will for you and what things you might like to do as a job. Mother, the things you may not like to do. So, uh, like growing up, like, you know, my parents did different things and you know, I'd go to work with them.

Speaker 1:          01:32          Here is my mother was an aerobic instructor. There I am in the background. If you can see really, and yes, it was the 80s, you know. Okay. It's not my fault. All right. Um, my dad was a dentist. Here I am at the dentist. I'm helping my dad. He only let me use that drill once though. I, yeah. But anyways, I looked good and strong in scrubs, but I'm seriously though, I'm telling a little bit about myself. Okay. So not for the jokes. Uh, okay. So I have always sort of, uh, growing up, I, my dad was in the navy. We lived all over the place. Um, the one thing that I always took with me was a artwork. So I always drew, I always made stuff, you know, they're there. I am in that corner there. When I was really young, writing my first book, um, it was a novel.

Speaker 1:          02:20          It took me forever, you know. Uh, but, um, you know, I was always making things. I was just drawing and I was, and, and, and, uh, creating things with my hands, uh, because that was the, that was what could come with me if I didn't have friends in a new space or, you know, if I, it was, uh, we had moved, my artwork always came with me. So I spent a lot of time by myself making things. And when, when I was young, you know, there were no Michael's stores. So, um, you know, getting supplies to make this stuff wasn't, wasn't always as easy. So I was always rummaging through the garbage or, you know, anything extra, making things out of box of cereal boxes, um, uh, styrofoam from any sort of, uh, electronic that we ever got. I was always, you know, buying are grabbing the boxes and making stuff out of it.

Speaker 1:          03:07          If there was a toy that I, that didn't exist, I would make it myself out of whatever I could. Um, right there you see a picture of me with my little sister. Um, I think I made a little cardboard puppetry stage and as usual my sister would destroy it, you know, within a few seconds she would come over, oh, this is great rep, you know? So that was kind of, um, what it was like, ah, this is a drawing I did, I think back in first grade and I've always had an interest in biology and zoology and paleontology. I love dinosaurs. I love, you know, but I really just loved making artwork and kind of telling stories with pictures. As you can see. Also, I was a little bit of an EGOMANIAC. My name is really big up in the corner and I think that's kind of translated into, you know, myself now.

Speaker 1:          03:54          Um, but, uh, so, uh, it was, uh, it, but being an artist really wasn't a viable option, at least when I was younger, uh, for a career. I, at the time we didn't have the Google and we couldn't go online and figure out, you know, do our research so easily. You know, we had to go to those things called libraries and things and we would go and I didn't know as much about all the creative jobs that are out there, all the ways that you can sort of channel that creative energy and that, that talent. Um, and so when I went off from, uh, high school, uh, I didn't have a lot of motivation. I mean, really, I, I, uh, to, to, to find out what I could do. My parents didn't want me to be a starving artist. They use that a lot all the time.

Speaker 1:          04:38          We don't want you to be a starving artist, you know? Um, and uh, so I went to school for my college years and I studied biology. My, my, uh, I actually, uh, my undergraduate degree is in biological sciences and it was going to be a doctor. I studied premed. Uh, I went to Clemson University for my undergraduate degree. Um, and you can see me, I think I'm up in the corner there. I'm somewhere. Anyway, so I went to Clemson the entire time I was there though while I was studying all these biology and chemistry and biochemistry, which is horrible if you've ever, biochemistry is the worst. Um, after I, when I was studying all these different things, I, I felt something like, I felt like it wasn't quite right. I mean, I was interested in it and it was pretty good at it. And actually I got into medical school, but, but I just, it wasn't right.

Speaker 1:          05:29          So the whole time I was doing all this science, I was also doing artwork on the side. I was always doing sketches. I was always making these giant paintings of weird things. Um, and I wanted to see if there was a way I could apply that and some of my science skill, uh, to a job. But I just didn't know at the time. So before I went to med school, like I said, I got in before I went to school and be a doctor, which is a long haul, you know, it's, you, there's a lot that goes into it. My parents were really pushing for it. Um, I told him, listen, I need that. I want a year off before I go to school. And then went to live in New York City and um, oop, that one went before this one. Let's see. Well, so I lived in New York City.

Speaker 1:          06:09          That's, that's the apartment that we lived in, down in, um, on canal street. Actually. We had rats like this big, I swear to God. Um, it was, it was a really cool space that we lived in, but he actually, we lived over a stereo store, so like from noon til about seven at night. The, the, the vibrations from the stereos downstairs would move our furniture so they, everything would shake. Um, and during that time, and I lived in New York City, I worked for an organization that helped find corneas for people who have trouble with their eyes. And I worked with a lot of hospitals, so I was getting an idea of what it was. It was like to work with sick people. And I realized I didn't like working with sick people. I didn't know it was a good idea for me to work as a doctor if I didn't like doing that.

Speaker 1:          06:55          It was really hard and it was really scary. And so while I was here, you know, I came to that realization. And then I also, New York is a really exciting, creative place. I mean, there's all kinds of people doing all kinds of weird jobs. Things that you would never know existed. And while I was, while I was in New York at that time, and this was about 25 years ago, um, back back when, you know, the Times Square was not filled with, you know, lots of Disneyland like lights and everything. It was a lot different. I'm not going to go into that. Um, but uh, I also was meeting a lot of people who are doing a lot of different kinds of jobs and a lot of different kinds of creative jobs. And so I ended up going to my parents and saying, listen, this is not something I want to do.

Speaker 1:          07:38          I don't want to be a doctor. You know, I really want to do something creative. And shockingly, they told me, okay, you can do that, but you have to find something where you're really able to live because we ain't paying for your forever. And so I did my research and I, I discovered that there is something called industrial design and that is the design of products, all kinds of products, whether they be tables or scissors or you know, like cool Nike shoes or even toys, you know, that you get like action figures. I'm a big action figure collector actually. Um, I have a huge star wars figure collection, like 2000 different star wars figures and I've been collecting since 78 so I have a lot and I also collect transformers and you'll see a little bit of that trickle into the work I do. Um, I have a huge transformer collection now here in New York City.

Speaker 1:          08:28          We don't have a lot of space so I can't have like a transformers room in my apartment. I have a transformer closet, but um, thank goodness for offsite storage because that's where the rest of my collection goes. Anyways, I studied industrial design at, let's see if it picture comes up. Pratt Institute, which is in Brooklyn. And I, I, I took a grad, I did the graduate program at Pratt Institute study there for a couple of years. And while I was there, I, um, let's see if that other picture comes up. There it is. It's New York. Well, I already told you I was in New York. Um, while I was there I worked with a gentleman who, uh, he needed some help making popups and I was his intern and I just needed like an extra job to make some money, you know, it was okay, you know, I could cut up and full paper, whatever, you know, it wasn't a big deal.

Speaker 1:          09:15          I didn't really even think about popups. In fact, growing up I only had one pop up book and this was it. Um, this dinosaur's obviously and it was beautiful illustration and when you open it up, there's a pop up and it's a little different than, you know, from some of the ones that I do. You know, I do kind of a little bit more elaborate ones like this, but we'll get, get in there. Um, but I really loved it. Now this pop up ended up after it was in my household for a little while, probably about an hour or so. It looked like,

Speaker 2:          09:51          like

Speaker 1:          09:52          this because of one person in the house. So I really didn't think about popups. It was never in my mind

Speaker 2:          10:03          anything like that.

Speaker 1:          10:08          That's really, yeah. Yeah. Uh, so papa was worrying in my mind, but I would help. I, I, when I was younger and when I was in Grad School, I was helping this paper engineer and you know, I would cut in full paper and follow his instructions. And you know, it was a long time. I worked for him a couple of years just doing this. And, and, and when I got to school, I realized that maybe this is a, maybe this is something I can do. And so there was a lot. So, so for quite a few years I apprenticed and what that really means is I worked and I would help him with his work. And it wasn't always the stuff I wanted to do. In fact, the designs I didn't always like, even though he did really beautiful work,

Speaker 2:          10:50          like,

Speaker 1:          10:52          um, I worked with Robert Buddha, um, for many years and he does a lot of very white, beautiful structural popups and stuff. We worked on things for like the Moma and, and all kinds. And I'm an other publishers. I learned a lot from, from just learning how structurally how this stuff, but it wasn't always this stuff that I wanted to do myself. But that's really important in the beginning when you're learning something, sometimes you've got to do the work and it isn't always exactly what you want to do, but it helps you learn. So after years of learning all these different principles and learning all this stuff, how to make popups, I was, I got to start doing my own books. Um, some of the, the first two books I did were, weren't like these, they were these really weird books, the pop up book of Phobias and the public will get nightmares. They were these bizarre books. I never even thought they'd actually come out. Um, but, but actually the phobia book was really popular, especially with, um, with therapists in the city.

Speaker 1:          11:50          Then I was able to start making books that I really, really was about. Um, I had, uh, I, my first New York Times bestseller was a pop up book of butterflies. And after that we were able to create a series about prehistoric animals cause I love paleontology. First was this dinosaur book and called Encyclopedia Pre Historica. And this has been translated now into about 25 different languages around the world. And doing this project, you know, it says I collaborate on these books, I collaborated Roberts to Buddha. He would just sort of oversee things, but I would, I would do the writing, the artwork and the right and the engineering. So all, all parts of making a pop up book, we made three in this series. And when you make, when you're just starting out and you're making these big books, you learn a lot. Boy, you learn a lot, but you make a lot of mistakes.

Speaker 1:          12:38          And each book I look at it and I see a lot of mistakes. In fact, I can't always enjoy my books when they're finished because all I do is go, Oh, you could've done that better. Oh, that wasn't that good. But a lot of other people don't know that. So, um, you know, Aye, I, yes, I go to a therapist about this sort of stuff. So I did this series and then let's see what else we got. I've done a lot of books about, you know, a classic stories and fairy tales like Cinderella and the jungle book, which was really awesome. I love that. That one, I did a series about mythology. So I love learning about like things like mythology and history and science and, and um, I like, I kind of have one of those mines where I'm obsessive surprise. Um, like I, I get obsessive about this subject, so when I want to learn something, I just don't want to learn a little.

Speaker 1:          13:26          I got to learn a lot. And what happens though, when you do that, especially when you're creating books like this, you have only so much space in this, in this, uh, biological computer in your head. And so when I learned something else, it kind of pushes the old stuff out and the new stuff goes in. So I learned stuff and then, you know, it pushes all stuff. So thank God I still know how to walk and talk because you know, like I've learned so much about all these different subjects. So this is mythology, this series, the gods in here, a book is, that's actually pretty cool. There's a lot of fun to do. I did a book with Maurice Sendak at one point. Maurice Sendak did where the wild things are. This pop up book was called Mommy and it was about it. It barely had any words in it, but it was about a baby who went into a mad scientist lab.

Speaker 1:          14:09          And of course in in more racist world, the baby, uh, defeats all the monsters in funny ways, like pulling down their pants and doing fun stuff like that. Which of course, I mean it makes total sense. I also, like I said, really loves star wars. Now, I'm an old school star wars fan. And so I did the first book for the 30th anniversary of the original star wars trilogy. And that's awesome. This year is the 40th anniversary. So that book is 10 years old. Um, it was incredible. It was the, it was a huge dream come true. It was a dream and it was a nightmare, you know, making it so I'm so obsessive that I had to get everything just right that I actually put myself in that book as a character. Um, so it was fun to be able to do that and put some of my friends, in fact, a lot of times and some of them in my books, I do put family and friends, even pets, um, that I used to have.

Speaker 1:          15:02          In fact in my Cinderella book, my pet rabbits from when I was a kid are following Cinderella throughout the book. Uh, because, um, everyone wants to learn about Lucy Bernadine and fuzzball my pet rabbits from when I was, when these young, I also do the second star wars book and I'll probably do a third star wars book once we're finished with the new trilogy. I can't wait. I love comic books. Uh, and especially at DC comics I did to a superhero books so far, but there may be another big marvel one coming in the future. I actually got to work with six different comic book artists for this book. It was awesome to be able to create it and actually has a light up. Um, some of my books have light up parts and then I what they call my, my type of a work paper engineering, they call it low tech engineering cause I'm only working with one type of material paper.

Speaker 1:          15:50          But sometimes I use other things like electronics. So in this book and in the Star Wars book, there are electronics, like as a matter of fact, like at the end of the star wars book, here's Darth Vader now and it's at the top, there are two working lights and now you can't tell what the lights in here, but that lightsaber that Luke has lights up. And then on the opposite side, the Darth Vader windows. So there's actually wires that go in underneath the page. I wished the lights weren't so bright, but you would be able to see that better. But anyways, it's been cool to be able to create things like that. And then this one has a bat signal that lights up. It's super cool. Um, yes, I'm a Brownie. I totally made a pony book. It was awesome. And I can't wait for the big movie.

Speaker 1:          16:32          What's cool about working with Milo ponies? I in this book, I actually got to make myself a pony. Um, uh, my pony name is professor of paper scraps and I dare you to find me in this, in this book. I'm somewhere in one of the backgrounds. So it was really cool. I love the, I, my sister loved my little pony when we were young, but the new pony show is awesome and I was forced to watch all of them and it was great. It was great. I love it. It was really fun. I did. Sometimes I try to do books where they aren't just a book. There's something else. This book was for the game of Thrones and it not only becomes, it's not only a popup book about all the different places in the game of Thrones, in Westeros and everything, it also becomes a giant map. It's about as big as a table. So you can enjoy it both ways. Um, some people say like, it's important to think outside the box. I like to say it's important to think outside the book. And I'm, so there are a lot more projects that are coming up that we're trying to stretch the boundaries of what a pop up book can be or just what a book can be and how it can be interactive.

Speaker 1:          17:39          Um, I also like to express my feminine side and I, uh, Eh, I am big into princesses. Okay. So, um, and I'm cool with that. I'm cool with that. All right, so I've done, um, to Disney princess books. One was of course frozen because let me tell you, when Disney calls you up and they say, would you like to do a fro? You don't even let them finish the word you say. Yes, yes, I will. Um, I worked on the frozen book. I let me tell you, I didn't stop singing that song. I like to hear it in my sleep and I let it go. You know, I would hear it all the time, but it was, it was great. It was really fun to work on. And I also worked on a Disney princess book cause I love a classic animation. Um, and so many of those Disney princess movies, especially things like Cinderella and uh, well I was, I'm my personal favorite is a little mermaid. Um, those, those movies like really transformed the artists that I am today. So they were really big influences. And so do you to work on that and to make like Cinderella, super cool that Cinderella actually, she transforms. So she's like, Oh, I'm all sad, Cinderella. And then you pull the bottom of her skirt thing. You don't pull your skirt, but there's a little tab on the bottom and it transforms into like Super Fab, a Cinderella. So it was really cool. That was a hard pop to design.

Speaker 2:          18:59          Let's see here we go here.

Speaker 1:          19:07          Oh, oh. Well of course, in one of my most recent books, something I know that everyone here at Google loves Lego. So a couple of years ago the Lego folks came to me and they said, would you want to do a Lego? And I didn't even let them finish that sentence either. Um, yes, totally. I grew up building with Lego. Uh, but back when I was young, we didn't have all the cool sets that you guys have now. We just had like whatever, six colors and I think we had wheels maybe. Um, but it was, we never, when you would make something, it never looked like one object. It always just kind of look like, you know, a bunch of different bricks stuck together. Whereas now you have so many different pieces. It's, I actually, when I was researching this book, I tried to get the Lego people to tell me a number of all the different pieces that they've ever made, you know, not color, but then the types of pieces and they couldn't even give it to me.

Speaker 1:          19:58          There's so many different pieces. They don't even have a number for that. So when I worked on this book, I actually, uh, went to the Lego headquarters in Billund in Denmark. I went to their special like design headquarters, which is this big white like sort of vague, I think they call it the white box or something. And I can't tell you what was in there, but it was awesome. It was awesome. And um, it's really like, there's such artists that work there. It's incredible how they figure out how to make these beautiful things with these little plastic brick. It's, it's, it's, it's an, it's incredible. So working on this book, my research was really tough. I mean they had to, like, they sent me like 200 different Lego sets and I, you know, built Legos. It was really hard. Yeah. Actually, I got a couple of interns to help me. Um, because it takes a while. I mean, I know that some of the parents here know, like when you get those, you know, you get those sets, like it takes a while, especially when they're those big ones. So we built everything and then we made the uh, then, you know, made the pops and then made the artwork. Here's a little sample of what's inside,

Speaker 2:          21:02          like a pop up.

Speaker 1:          21:04          And I did the writing, the popups and the art in this. Um, yeah, and there are, there are cool pops in this, that transform, this one transforms into three different things. And then there's tons of mini figures and all kinds of cool things. That's my, that's my assistant there. Works in Ninjago too. Um, and it has this huge pop in it that is super tall. It's this big tall tower. Uh, pops. Actually we're going to have a giveaway of some books later on. So think in your mind about like some, some cool lego facts, just thinking in your head and we'll get back to that later on. So in Fra see notes, know, tell Tom. Okay, so his is how I do what I do.

Speaker 1:          21:45          All right. When I work in my office down in the West Village, um, all I do is I stick paper in the machine and Papa books come out. That's how I do it. All right, I'm ready. I'll see you later. No, actually that's not what I do. Don't you love my angry face in that picture too? I was like [inaudible] that's not how it's done. It's actually a really long process. Making a pop up book sometimes takes from like four to six months and uh, to, to make a whole book from the beginning to the end. And then most of that work has to be done about eight months before it's actually on the shelves. Because after I make one book, there has to be a whole group of people that helped me make thousands more. So here's how it's done

Speaker 1:          22:30          first. Do you know, of course, uh, I have to get ideas for things. I have to get inspiration. I look all around me. I look at the world everywhere and try to take inspiration from anything I can see. Or you know, you're lucky that you guys are in New York. There's so much here and I think most of the pictures that are here, I took in New York. Um, there's so much, there's so much to see and, but I think that you can be anywhere and be inspired by things. So I take inspiration from, from everywhere and um, sometimes you can see the way that some things built and that might inspire you to make something really cool in a pop up book. So the tools I use making popups of course, after I've written the story,

Speaker 2:          23:09          let's see.

Speaker 1:          23:12          Okay, paper. Yeah, I use a lot of card stock. I usually work in white card stock. This is it right here. You can get it. It's a little heavier than regular paper. You can get it like the office stores and everything. And the reason why I use it in white is first I want to figure out what the structure is and then I worry about coloring it or drawing on it or whatever. So usually in the beginning I just work in white paper. Um, I of course use a tape. I use different kinds of tape. I you said lots of scissors, glue, [inaudible] glue and exacto knife. The exacto knife I use to make really intricate cuts and I need lots of bandaids cause I don't just make cuts on the paper. I yes, I like Hello Kitty. Okay,

Speaker 3:          23:55          let's see.

Speaker 1:          23:56          So at the beginning, this is kind of what the rough pop up looks like. I may have an idea for what is going to happen on that popup page. Just words. I will never like draw a picture of what I'm going to make. I usually, uh, I just have a word of what might happen. So I just thought to myself, I wanted to have a pop up that uh, the dinosaur bit, the reader. I thought that'd be really fun because if you were going to experience a t rex, like that would be the coolest way to, well, I mean you wouldn't really want to be eaten, but it would be cool if they kind of came at you. So this is the first version and I'll take it apart very carefully. Trace the pieces in the computer using Adobe illustrator and I'll you make what are called dye lines and these guidelines are going to be used later on for when they manufacture this thousands of times over.

Speaker 1:          24:37          So I will remake the pop up sometimes up to 10 times or even 20 times, um, to make sure that it works just right when you can see there's even notes on that and everything and that's what it looks like in the final. Now one of the things that I also make the artwork as well, and I'll show you how I do that as a, also I do a style of artwork called cut paper collage. So I'm cutting up paper to make the pops. I thought it'd be cool to also cut up paper to make the artwork as well.

Speaker 1:          25:06          Oh, in the beginning, this is where the pop up looks like. This is just this get the movement right now. I actually went and studied a horse and how it moved and this was going to be a book. This book never actually came out. Oh, well anyways. Um, why don't, why don't you buy for you? Uh, it wasn't that exciting. I swear. I swear it's not. So this is, um, an early prototype that actually had sketches on it. This is, this is something that's called, um, uh, white dummy and it, it goes to the, my editor now the editor works at a publisher and she kind of corrects all my work. She kind of imagine it's like your teacher and she actually goes through and marks things that are, that are written wrong or she may have been mark some of the pops and say, I don't think that this is a good thing that you should do, should do something else. So she'll, um, and just like a teacher or she marks it in red, you know, so it's great when you get that back. But usually I don't get, I do okay with my editors and usually they're, they're on the same. Um, they, they're on the same page. So this bigger, uh, I didn't mean to do that. I'm sorry. Um, as me, when we're making popups and this is just, you know, show you some of the details that growing up go into making it,

Speaker 1:          26:13          this is an early version of the Darth Vader pop. This was a really tough pop up to make because, um, there's two portions of Darth Vader's helmet. There's a, well, there's actually, there's, there's three, there's, I don't want to get into it, I'm not going to get into it, but there's anyways, what, what happens with this is actually you could, I wanted the reader to be able to see Anna can for a couple of seconds before the mass closed up over and when the popup open. So you can actually, if you look as it's opening, it's really important. Like the time, you can see him for a second and then it closes over his face. Cause because everyone makes, everyone notices those little things. So this took me a long time to be, and I had to actually engineer the front part of his face separately than the back and then put them together.

Speaker 1:          26:56          So it took a lot, a lot of time and a lot of prototypes to get it. You even look like this. So you see, I've kind of sculpted it and white first and then their sketches around it and then, and then, and then, oh, that's the wrong thing. And then, then that's the final color version. When I was doing this book I actually, which was awesome. I got, you know, I do get some perks when I work with some of these, uh, different, uh, companies and things. I got to go to this star wars archives. So this was the Lucas film archives in Marin County. This was actually at the Skywalker ranch. They don't even let people go here anymore. So I, I got in there at the right time. Um, and they had all the masks from the old movies. Those are actual stunt light sabers.

Speaker 1:          27:39          That's my, my editor and I, and we're getting ready to fight about something and those are stunt library lightsabers from him. And the matte painting in the back is actually used from the empire strikes back. Um, so I am like, I couldn't stop smiling after this was so much fun to go see and you know, did I need to go? I remember when my editor says, Oh, do you think you're going to need to go to the Lucas archives to look at things now I know. Let me do it. At the time I owned hundreds of star wars books, I had every movie, you know, I have tons. I knew everything about it. Of course it was like, yes, I think, I think I should probably go. So I was able to go. It was, it was an awesome experience and I've had a lot of Nice experiences like that.

Speaker 1:          28:16          Like the big fan in me gets to go do these cool things. This is me working in my student, not this fast. I, this is, yeah, this is me working in the studio probably over a few hours and I'm designing a pop up and as you can see it's just by hand. There's no computer program. The computer program, it comes in when I actually take the pop apart and trace it now after I've made all those dye lines, all those lines that are tracings of pieces I may go in and make artwork sometimes isn't the computers, sometimes it's by hand and I put the artwork and those dialogues together rebuild the pop up again and again to make sure it works. And that is how a popup was made. This was for the transformers pop up book. Like I said, I love transformers that um, that was just a, a quick pop up, how to make, um, for that book.

Speaker 1:          29:02          That was an incredible book to do as well. I have a lot of dream projects that come true. People always ask me, you must not have any more dreams laugh. I be like, let me tell you. I've got lots. There's always something else that I wanted to do. I have a lot of dreams. Um, this is just a prototype of what the book looks like before it was in color. And um, sometimes I do the artwork and sometimes other people do the art work. Like I said, I worked with Maurice Sendak once. Um, and then for this book I actually worked with, um, a great transformer artist name Ameliana Ameliana no, centrally. He lives in Italy. I actually never got to see him the whole time we worked over, you know, we just send things back and forth to each other over the Internet. And I would draw the sort of sketch and what he should draw and made all kinds of notes about what, where and where, what it should look like.

Speaker 1:          29:47          And then he would make the art and then I would put that with those dieline pieces. So you can see like sometimes for one pop up there might be like 30 different pieces that work in tandem. All these different levers and, and different mech mechanics working together. Or there may be other times when I make the artwork myself, now I think about making a pop up. Um, okay, so there's three different stages and making pop up. You have to have the, you have the writing done, you know, and the reason we'd ever research and writing, um, that's like a cake. You know, when you're making cake, that's the recipe or you got to have that. The next step is the actual cake. You know, you're actually going to bake something. So, um, the next step is actually making the cake. And then the artwork is the frosting to me.

Speaker 1:          30:23          I love frosting. Um, so making color artwork. Now I said I use, I make a style called a cut paper collage and I actually by hand, uh, make all these different types of art. Sometimes it's digital, but usually it's by hand. I, I take all these papers that I've made in my studio, all these different textures. I have a huge rack of different new papers that, that we're constantly using. And I will, uh, I will show you how a little bit, how it's done. First I'll draw a picture. I'm just very quickly, uh, it's usually tighten up a sketch and then I'll use that sketch as my, as my, I'm sort of map and I'll cut out sections of different colored paper with my exacto knife.

Speaker 3:          31:06          Okay.

Speaker 1:          31:06          I'll lay it in the place using my sketch sort of as a guide and I printed on a clear piece of plastic. Um, then I'll glue in the different pieces of colored paper.

Speaker 1:          31:17          And the glue I use is very similar to Elmers glue, White Glue. And then that's what the final thing will look like. And it's a very small piece of artwork, but it may have 20 different little pieces of paper all glued together. Make one. Sometimes some of my larger pieces, um, may have, uh, you know, hundreds of pieces of paper glued together. When I make the artwork for the pop up pieces, it's a little different. I have to make the artwork like all splat it out and like, it's almost looks like a, it's like pop up road kill, you know, like they're, they're offside. There's pieces here and there. Um, and, and after so many years, I figured out where each piece needs to be or what needs to be on what's piece, cause sometimes the head isn't necessarily connected to the body. So, um, I figured it out after a long time.

Speaker 1:          32:00          But you know, they're the one thing I don't really say, do you guys, uh, it didn't say that earlier was that there are a lot of mistakes along the way. I don't just start out and have the perfect idea first. And it all looks great for every wow pop up that you see. There's a lot of not so wows that get thrown out. And that's the way I figure things out. You know, I, I sort of, I will make something and see if it's something I like. If it's not, then I try something different and that's, you know, hopefully you guys can get from this. It doesn't come out perfect and it's okay because we're supposed to learn from our mistakes and I've made saw many of them you wouldn't even know. And it's okay to do that cause that's how we get better. Well, so, okay.

Speaker 1:          32:45          So I've made one pop up, I've made all the art, I've made all the pops and I may all the words. Now what do I do? So I send all that and I send one pop up book that I made by hand to a manufacturer and the manufacturer, they're actually pop pop up books or hand manufactured. Once I make one pop up book, um, I uh, the next step is sending all that information to uh, uh, a printer and a hand assembly, a manufacturer. And um, uh, so that's all sent. Usually the work is done overseas. Um, and I've worked with a lot of these manufacturers for years, so they understand how to put together popups. In fact, they're more of experts than assembling popups then than I could ever be. And they tell me things, this doesn't work. This will work. Here's some ideas about things.

Speaker 1:          33:31          So what they'll do is they'll break down the book and into different groups and one group will make just one page of a book. And I'm so each person they'll remake, we used person, we'll make one section of, so for example, if this ad ad here, one person will assemble this leg and handed off to the next person and there will be a large group that just works on this page and they'll make thousands. Sometimes it can make up, they're like 15,000 a week. Um, they're really hand, they're really incredibly skilled hand laborers and they, they oftentimes come up with ideas that are way better than what I come up with. So I work the entire time during that production, which is usually, like I said, about eight months before in a book, hits the shelves. So they'll send me prototypes and then once they actually start building the books, they can, you know, make up to 15,000 a week.

Speaker 1:          34:20          They'll package them up, um, after they've made each spread, they'll, they'll glue them together. Then the little cover on it though, I'm clamp them, let them dry, and then they will get shipped off in boxes all over the world. So it's kind of goes from my hands creating the original book to the manufacturer's hands, to your hands in the, in, um, in the bookstores. So it's really, it's really too cool. But there are a lot of products that we don't realize are made by hand when they are. There isn't like some giant machine that will do all this work for us. You know, there's some really intricate things that we, um, that we have and that we buy and there are hands that go into it. So now I'm going to show you, now that I've talked about myself enough, uh, we're going to make a pop right here and I'm going to show you some basics and, um, but I, but I'm going to need an idea for what I should make. Now, last time someone came up with a really crazy idea and, um, I've, I did it of course, but, uh, it was something, it was pretty funny. So a, anyone got an idea? You want to raise your hand and I'll take, let's see. Let's see. Okay. Yes, plants. Okay. That works well. I like this green. So I'm gonna use that for the actual plants, I think. So what I'm going to start with is just this card stock. I'm going to fold it in half.

Speaker 3:          35:49          Okay.

Speaker 1:          35:50          Oh, I've already got an idea. Oh, oh, oh, oh yeah. So, okay, we're gonna start off. This is, we took a piece of paper and we folded in half just like that. All right. And um, just for the sake of being able to see it on video, I'm going to make a line down the center so it's a little easier to see. So you see that center line we're going to, when we make some of our pieces, we're going to align it. We're gonna line up the folds on things cause that's a lot of pop up people. Do they like line up different folds to make sure things work right? So one of the things, I'm going to make something called a beef fold and the Vif old is actually, well, it's shaped like a v and most of the popups in, in most of my books use some form of Vif fold.

Speaker 1:          36:37          Um, that's not a good one. Okay, see this, see this big dinosaur, see, see this, this piece underneath his body here that, and it's sort of like triangular and v. So that's a v and you can see that it moves. It actually is forcing all these pieces to move up. So a vehicle moves. And so what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna Make Two v folds and I'm gonna Make Two v folds that that are, they're both right angles, right angles are 90 degree angles, right? Um, correct. I mean. Correct. Uh, so let's see here. I'm to take a piece of, I'm going to take a different piece would say gray so that you can see these pieces. And what I'm gonna do is I'm going to make, first, I'm going to make a square, a small square out of paper, and then I'm going to make two triangles from that square.

Speaker 3:          37:30          Yeah.

Speaker 1:          37:30          And you say, Matthew, how can that be done? I just don't know. Well, okay, so right. I just folded the rectangle right now. Correct. I mean, because if I say right angle, it's, it's very confusing. So then I'm going to fold this triangle down like this

Speaker 3:          37:50          and

Speaker 1:          37:52          I'll be able to see, I cut it along the edge like that.

Speaker 3:          38:00          Okay.

Speaker 1:          38:01          And like, uh, then we have a square cause this side, this side, this side and this side. It's pretty close. It's pretty close. And we need two triangles that are, oh, if I cut this down the middle, I get two triangles that are equal. Right? We're learning geometry to today. Good thing you're not in school. You know, it's funny. People say all the time, you must have been really good at geometry. And I don't remember. I don't think I w I think I, no, I wasn't. I was not a great math student. Um, I did okay. But Calculus, Oh man, did that kill me? Um, so there we have two triangles and what we're going to do is fold them in half and we're going to make two v folds. There's one,

Speaker 3:          38:45          yeah.

Speaker 1:          38:47          And the fold where theV is, is going to be down here. Here's the second one. And we're going to tape these onto our base. And you know what I'm going to do? I'm going to make a line on that full just so we know so you can see it better. Cause I last time we couldn't see it as well.

Speaker 3:          39:06          Okay,

Speaker 1:          39:13          sure. It's really open isn't it? Yeah cause now I've given you a lot of cleavage today. All right, so here are Our v folds and we're going to have them actually when we glue them onto this onto the page, we're going to have them point to the points touching. So we're going to, we're going to make sure that that center line on the top V is lined up with the main base. Page one. We're going to do the same on the bottom. Just like that kind of looks like an hourglass a little bit. Right. And I'm gonna use some white tape if I have it. Yes. So I use this tape, it's very similar to masking tape in my studio. It's art artists tape and we're going to, we're going to tape along the v because it's a v fold and there is one.

Speaker 3:          40:16          Okay.

Speaker 1:          40:17          Lined up just like that. And I always make sure that I put, I make sure that the tape is really secure on there. So now we can see when it moves. See there is one V,

Speaker 3:          40:29          Huh.

Speaker 1:          40:30          Now we want another view, but it's going to go the other way. Actually I'm going to move it more towards the middle. That's the other thing. You can't be afraid. Don't be afraid when you're making these popups. Don't be afraid to pick up the pieces and move them around. If you don't like the way they are

Speaker 1:          40:50          can always change, you know, always make, you know, remake and fix your mistakes. I'm just, by the way, I also, uh, have a, uh, I'm supposed to remember like all my social media stuff, so I'm cause I'm not real good at it. So I have a youtube page where you can make your own pops. Um, uh, if you look up Matthew Reinhardt, it's called a law. Um, let's make it pop. And I have different crafts. I'm trying to do them every week. So if I miss a week, please don't get mad at me. Um, but, uh, there's always different things. In fact, tomorrow is National Superhero Day, so wear your Cape. Okay. Um, anyways, tomorrow is national spirit and there's a pop up super hero card that we made for a, and I think it went up today so you can make your own, um, superior. So there's One v and I'm going to attach the second V. I know a plant, I'm making the plant. Um,

Speaker 3:          41:41          I'm going to just attach this

Speaker 1:          41:45          and then what we're going to do once we have these two V's working in opposite directions, then we're going to make something. It's a, it's a mechanism or I'm going to show you they are the two. All right? And they look, they're going in different directions. One's going up, one's going down. What's cool about this is one side, like this lower triangle here, if we attach something to the edge here on the opposite side, on the top, on that same edge, so on opposite sides. So let's see, I'm looking at myself on there and there. So if we had make a bridge going across, if we make a bridge going, I was trying to watch myself in this thing and I was like, wait, what's going on? If we make a bridge going across what we'll actually, we'll be able to connect the two and we'll make a pop up that kind of expands and twists. So it's really cool. So the next thing we're going to do is we're going to kind of make a little bit thinner, longer sort of bridge piece. And I'm going to mark with another color, the the edges that we're going to connect.

Speaker 3:          42:56          Okay.

Speaker 1:          42:58          You guys see that there to there and then I'm going to see, did I make, I didn't make that long enough. If you saw my studio, it is a wreck. I mean there's, there's paper everywhere. Sometimes I'll come out of my office after a long day and I'll just have paper all over. I won't even realize it. And you know, you know, people are like y'all get home and, and you know it's like there's something on your shirt and it's like the shoes, you know, piece of piece of paper or half of a pop up. Like nobody told me this on the way out. Okay, so it's going to go across. The only thing that is not going to work is we need to snip off this little bit and this little bit. So I'm just gonna use my marker

Speaker 3:          43:41          and

Speaker 1:          43:42          roughly get align.

Speaker 3:          43:47          So there you can see where I'm supposed to cut it and want to snip, snip using my tape. And we're going to

Speaker 1:          43:59          attach this. And what's cool at with this is we're going to do a part where it makes sense. Okay. So now we are going to attach it from under here. We'll have a tape go up. Like I said, this pop up is called a twister because it twists. Oh, that's a cool. The reminder. Matthew, please shut up soon. All right, here we go. All right, so now it's attached from here. All the way across. There's a bridge and when we close it, see how it sort of Boeing, oop, we don't want that. I mean, come on man. I'm just gonna make sure it's attached, right? And that you have your tape on there pretty hard. All right, so we're going to fold it and it's going to sort of arc like that. And what's going to happen is you're going to fold it and it will, you are going to find, find the fold. So you're going to kind of press down on your pop and smash a little. So now, now, uh, I'm a very sensitive artist. Okay. So when I opened this, I needed like positive reinforcement. So I need you to say like, Ooh, like be really surprised and excited when you see it. Okay. Let me make sure. Okay. All right.

Speaker 1:          45:18          Thank God. Thank God. Wow, that's really exciting. Wow. All right. But this is the start of what we can start building on top of this. So let's see, what can we do? You're going to make a plant, right? So first we need some leaves, right? And every surface that's here, it has potential to become a part of the pop up. So I'm going to use double stick tape. Now. Usually I use glue, but because you know I don't have a lot of time. There we go. So there's a leaf and another leaf. So you guys having fun today, you learn a lot about, about what your mom and dad's and everyone else, all your parents do. Is it boring? No. Okay, good. I didn't think it'd be boring here. Every time I pass by here. So I live in New York. I live actually in Chelsea.

Speaker 1:          46:21          I'm a few blocks from here. Every time I pass by Google Belding I always think to myself, God, I want a job there. Um, because everyone looks like they're so like having fun and smart and you know, here I am on my bike and I'm, you know, covered with paper and sad and pathetic. So, um, so there's the start of my plant. Maybe I'll put some leaves here, but whatever you're doing here seems exciting. And so it's cool to be able to get an idea of what people do. Okay. I'm starting to get more here. It's still, and I'm just adding pieces of paper. Let's see. And it doesn't look as pretty in the beginning. Sometimes it's just getting those shapes right.

Speaker 1:          47:07          Let's see. Okay. I don't want to get a little better. I mean they wouldn't be hiring me for the, uh, the Google doodles anytime soon on that one. Um, let's see. We also maybe, you know, most plants kind of need a little pot to go in, so we'll cut a little shape down here. Oh, by the way, should we do that now while I finish this up? Um, we are going to give away. How many books do we have for, um, we have four books to give away. Um, now, I'm sorry, we don't have a lot more. Um, but that's all we had to give away for today. Um, you can find my books anywhere. Like any bookstore, you can find it online and Amazon, all those places. Um, uh, even places like toys r us and things like that. So, you know, like there are everywhere.

Speaker 1:          47:57          Um, I, like I said, I have a youtube channel. You can find me on Facebook. Uh, there's a, um, Matthew rock pop up books by Matthew Reinhardt. Um, so I'm all over the place and we're going to do a quick, we're going to have people, if you have a Lego fact, I want you to raise your hand and Lauren will pick. Now you have to tell us what your fact is and then you get a book. Um, so Lauren, why don't you start going ahead and I'll finish up my pop up while you start doing that. Yeah.

Speaker 2:          48:26          Yep.

Speaker 1:          48:29          And you have to speak up so we can hear you. That's part of it. You have to end. You can't make it up. All Right,

Speaker 2:          48:39          nice.

Speaker 1:          48:44          83. That's right. Get the man a book. Congratulations. And I will sign your book at the end, um, after we're finished. If you'd like. Oh, the fact was it's been around how many years? 80, 83 years.

Speaker 2:          49:06          Okay. Go for it. Oh yeah, that sounds right. That sounds good.

Speaker 1:          49:23          Awesome. Congratulations. Oh, that's right. And it's actually in my lego pop. You get to see that the evolution of many fingers. How many living now do you guys have? Lots of Lego mini figures. Yeah. It's kind of insane how many there are now. Okay. I'm still working on this,

Speaker 2:          49:52          right? Yeah.

Speaker 1:          49:56          What's you, what Lego's headquarters really? I mean, yes. I mean, yes. I think you said something about quarters. I was like, what? Headquarters? Yes, of course. I was there. Totally. Yeah. I'm sorry. I'm out of it, you guys. All right. So awesome. Congratulations everybody who wanted the book. And like I said, I will. I will definitely. So wait, I'm not quite done. Um, so she said you wanted to plant, but you know, like plants aren't always most active, you know, things.
