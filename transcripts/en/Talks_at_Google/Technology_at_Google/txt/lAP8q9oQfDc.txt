Speaker 1:          00:00:05       Good afternoon. It's great to be back and it's great to be back with my very good friend Dan Doctoroff, uh, who as you know, has written a book, which I think is actually fantastic. If you want to understand how the city around you, it was built, read this book. If you want to understand how hard it is, read this book. If you want to understand what it takes to transform a city during your adult lifetimes here, read this book, uh, and we'll have copies at the end, uh, in the back of Danville side, a few and so forth. I'll ask a few questions and as usual, then we'll have your questions as well. Uh, before we actually talk about the book, what are you doing in Toronto?

Speaker 2:          00:00:43       Because everybody heard anything about what sidewalk labs is doing, so you know that, so I was deputy mayor for uh, uh, six years and then I ran Bloomberg Lp. Um, and then when Mike Bloomberg decided that, you know, he wanted to get back involved in the business side, I said, I want to go do something on my own. And so we teamed up together a Google now, alphabet and me, and we created sidewalk labs and sidewalk labs is a bat just like Waymo and others. And our mission is fundamentally to improve life in cities. Um, and we're going about it in a, I think incredible way. I am so excited about this. Um, we want to build, um, a city are really a district of a city. And so just a few weeks ago we announced that we're partnering with Toronto. Uh, I've not learned how to say Toronto actually for those of you who are right, there's no big t on the end.

Speaker 2:          00:01:46       Toronto. It's like Toronto. Toronto. Yeah. And uh, um, it is an amazing city for those of you who haven't ever been there. It's really close to here, like an hour and 15 minutes away. But, um, we, when we say we want to build a district or a city, we want to be able to show how bringing together um, great urban design and cutting edge technology on an integrated basis across kind of every urban system. So how we get around sustainability, the nature of buildings, public space, community and social services driven by data. How we can fundamentally bend the curve on every aspect of quality of life. Can we actually, and we believe we can based on two years of work, which Eric has helped to guide us on. Um, can we dramatically reduce the cost of living in a city? We believe that. Can we actually create the only climate positive place on earth? We think it can be done. Can we actually achieve vision zero where there are no accidents on streets? We think it can be done. Can we give time-starved parents an hour or more back in their day? We think all of that can be done. This isn't easy. This is big. It's long, it's complex. Uh, but that's what we're all about. And uh, we're really excited about it. The, uh, everybody at Google and alphabet has been so supportive. Uh, but we have a chance, I think to really make history. And so I'm happy to talk

Speaker 1:          00:03:27       more about it and questions. We support what you're doing incredibly. Yeah, it's been rough. The whole team has boundaries talking about it. So let's talk about New York. Um, your book largely begins with your inauguration of Mike Bloomberg, the mayor, and you sort of running everything with him. Um, and one of the first things you did is you did an assessment of the city from the standpoint of being kind of in charge of it. Um, and you had a number of very interesting observations, housing shortage. We're dealmaking take us through, take us back to 2002, right? Nine 11 is just happened. The city is recovering from the horror, horrific tragedy. Has It feel, what'd you learn? What'd you see? It was kind of terrifying. I'm on the, the

Speaker 2:          00:04:12       one hand, on the other hand, the title of my book greater than ever comes from sort of the declaration that then mayor Rudy Giuliani made literally on nine 11 that New Yorkers, we're not going to be intimidated by the terrorist attack, the tragedy, and instead we're going to make the city greater than ever. And that as a rallying cry actually I think enabled a lot of what we were subsequently able to do. So on the one hand you came in and the city was basically destroyed financially it was a rack, um, physically because of nine 11 you say that? Oh yeah, totally. Nine, 11, the number of jobs and people who fled the city in the immediate aftermath of nine 11 was really kind of frightening. You know, we lost that tens of thousands of tourism jobs, literally overnight. The financial services sector, which was concentrated downtown, many of the firms to camp almost immediately to New Jersey.

Speaker 2:          00:05:19       Um, there were, there's a great kind of article, I mean, terrible article in a way in the New York Times questioning whether New York and its existing model of openness sort of would actually be able to survive. So that was the conditions that we came into. So you had a whole area of the city that was destroyed. Most of the rest of the world thought more of New York was destroyed financially. The budget was a disaster. We were facing a $5 billion budget deficits in our first year. Literally that opened up overnight. Um, and emotionally the city was on edge. So the question is, what do you do about it? And a, it's, Eric said the, one of the first things that we did is we stepped back and said, you know what, let's think of New York with a completely clean slate. I mean in the sense that let's look at it in an unvarnished way.

Speaker 2:          00:06:13       What are our strengths? What are weaknesses, the way you would a business. And so we literally brought in consulting firms, they did a ton of work. We looked at different businesses and whether they ought to be in New York or not. And um, and out of that evolved a strategy, um, that we pursued pretty relentlessly for the next 12 years. And you know, I like to think that, you know, while wasn't perfect, um, overall we really got the band was interesting. One of the things that you first discovered, which you shouldn't be paying off businesses by in the city. And this is a time when everyone's leaving, right? So everyone's coming to the city and saying, I want $1 billion tax abatement or what have you. And in the book you actually tell the stories of what actually happened and he's very difficult discussions with people who had been promised large windfalls.

Speaker 2:          00:07:03       Right. And you canceled them. We did. And this was almost right away. Um, we just believe based on that analysis that people were either going to stay here or not based on what ever they needed in the, ultimately the economics of being here. So companies that really had sort of a significant amount of kind of intellectual capital that we're powering the business, they were going to stay because they could find better people here. We really believe that that companies that were extremely cost conscious at the end of the day over time, and whether it was a division or a unit of a company that was really dependent upon sort of very tight margins, we couldn't keep them here by, we had almost no manufacturing jobs left in the city. And so we developed a strategy and this one of the stories that you're referring to as the New York Stock Exchange, right?

Speaker 2:          00:07:57       So New York Stock Exchange, it's been down in Wall Street basically since 1792 the Giuliani administration with the state had negotiated a one point $1 billion package to move them into a new headquarters across the street. Said 1.1 billion. We don't have 1.1 billion in this day and age. And by the way, we think I should also point out that the stock market's going to go completely electronic. So what do they need a whole new building for? Even though we had actually already purchased on their behalf of building across the street and we're paying rent to other people, we just decided to kill it. And of course the stock has changed it and move. And of course there's literally nobody working on the trading floor anymore other than like reporters from my old company like Bloomberg because they need a good stage, uh, to show what's actually happening in financial markets. We did the same thing by the way, baseball stadiums, both the Yankees and the mats had deals with the Juliet Giuliani Administration for new stadiums that would have required the city to put up most of the money. We killed them on day one.

Speaker 1:          00:09:07       One of the, one of the interesting stories that you talk about is when you started, you realized that there was this acute housing shortage and then no one was addressing the affordable housing shortage. Uh, and it seems like there's plenty of housing in the city. It's just too expensive. So you're saying there wasn't enough or you were saying there wasn't enough housing in general? Are there wasn't a housing

Speaker 2:          00:09:27       have afforded? We said was we believed in the future of New York. We came in with an extremely sort of, despite the conditions, extremely optimistic view that um, and that the goal of a city is actually to grow, um, that, you know, I just grow or die. It's grow or die and that we needed, would need over time to accommodate the growth that we hope to generate. And that growth would require Watsa housing and that would require housing at every price point for all income levels. And so at a time when we didn't have any money, when no one was calling for an affordable housing plan, um, when in Mike's campaign, either he nor his opponent, um, actually had any plans for affordable housing. Um, literally within months after him becoming mayor, we announced what was to become the largest municipal affordable housing program of all time. Now the reality is that even at the end of the day, it wasn't enough. The city actually grew faster than we thought. You know, when we came into office are about 8 million people in New York, there's now about 8.6 million people in New York. So we've added over the last 15 years in this city, a city in effect the size of Boston or bigger than Atlanta, I think, or Miami. And we tried to produce enough housing. I don't think we actually have. Um, and that it was probably one of my,

Speaker 1:          00:11:01       Oh, in, in the politics and the politics, let's, let's say that your mantra directly or indirectly is grow or die, right? That cities need investment. And a, I see as I walk around the city, nothing but construction, which of course inconvenience is the traffic but produces many high paying, high quality jobs. I ever had any traffic in the Bloomberg administration ever had any traffic. So, so who fights you when you have a growth or die mindset? Who is your opponent?

Speaker 2:          00:11:31       Uh, a lot of people. Um, the, the, the big question is how do you accommodate the growth, right? How do you physically, so in order to accommodate that growth, we literally looked across the entire city and said, we've got to create more, um, land so people can build more housing. Well as other stuff. And in order to do that, you have to go through a process called zoning. And that is a extremely public process. And we did over 12 years, 140 separate rezonings. So, you know, like the area around the high line, which was part of one of the rezonings West Chelsea, right? We're right here. So that was west of ninth avenue was zoned complete or the guest west of 10th was on completely for manufacturing. We wanted it to have housing there. We also saved the high line at the same time. So everybody was opposed to it at the very beginning.

Speaker 2:          00:12:33       Uh, because like they didn't want housing across the street. I mean, what are the great things you'll learn in government is no matter what your proposed, no matter how good it is, there's going to be people that are going to hate it. I mean, literally hate it and they're, they've got a valid, um, a way to express it. Uh, and you have to overcome it. So it, most likely it's going to be the local residents who are affected by whatever it is you want to do. Because know we got good at listening to the residents and reflecting their comments and doing which lands and then mostly doing,

Speaker 1:          00:13:11       so if we go back to two, should a Moses, Robert Moses, right? That was another growth, her die strategy, which ended in sort of a horrific outcome for him. Right? He should have built all the energy changes. And then when he finally proposed this interchange, the basically a highway across Manhattan and having sort of destroyed the south Bronx, um, and he's, you know, a few years earlier that was sort of the, and there was this huge political upwelling against him. Um, how did you figure out a way to avoid the Robert Moses fee?

Speaker 2:          00:13:41       We, a couple of things. One is we actually listened to communities that was important, but I think the more important thing is we basically went, were know as where, as few people as possible. Actually we're so, you know, over the course of these 12, I think even in the six years that I was there, we had completely changed the way we thought about the city from a land use perspective. We rezoned, you know, a huge percentage of the city creating room for 120 million square feet, huge and commercial areas, residential areas. Uh, we created I think two, 3000 acres of parks. Um, we built three stadiums or arenas. Um, we, you know, we talked a lot about the affordable housing itself. We built a subway. Um, and literally out of all of that, I think we displaced, you know, 400 people, right?

Speaker 1:          00:14:40       We didn't. So the secret, the secret was finding spaces where you could get a small percentage of population who are sort of annoyed and work with them and ultimately build something that benefited.

Speaker 2:          00:14:50       That's exactly right. And, and where that tended to be is in the old industrial areas of the city. People don't realize it today, but you know, after World War Two, and even before World War II, New York was like a great manufacturing center. There was a million manufacturing jobs in New York after World War II. By the time we came into office there were 140,000 left. But because people retain this sort of romantic notion that manufacturing, big manufacturing, lots of jobs are going to come back. The city had never done anything with all of the buildings and the land that used to be industrial but was now essentially vacant. And most of that was along the waterfront in Brooklyn and Queens on the west side of Manhattan and the area around downtown Brooklyn in the South Bronx. And we said no more nostalgia. Um, what we're going to do is make that land available for residential, commercial sparks every, we did all these plans for all these neighborhoods and look at long island city for so long. I say, so I don't know how many of you guys live in either Williamsburg, Greenpoint or long island city for example. So a few here. Everyone else probably lives somewhere in Brooklyn, but the uh, um, those areas, there was nothing there at all. So you look around sorta across the river from Manhattan and look at what's happening over there. None of it existed. So downtown Brooklyn, by the way, exactly the same thing,

Speaker 1:          00:16:25       the, um, one of the things that happens throughout your book, you just spent an awful lot of time talking about the Olympics. Now had you asked me in 2002, if you are a crazy idea of getting the Olympics to New York City was a good idea. I would have said no, but in your book you become more and more convinced of your rightness. So why don't you defend yourself now. But it's clear that the Olympics and more seriously really helped you understand what it would take to transform the city. Yeah. Right. That the mechanism of planning for the Olympics, right. Forcing you to think through every aspect of it, then con created the conditions that would create the outcome. You,

Speaker 2:          00:17:05       yeah. Not So. So give you a little bit of background on that. So I had the crazy idea that New York actually ought to host the Olympics. And I had it, you know, back in 1994 when somebody asks me to go to the World Cup semifinal game out at giants stadium and the metal lands happened to be Italy versus Bulgaria, two teams. I could not have cared less about an s in a sport I hated. Um, and, and a friend dragged me out on a hundred degree day in July to this brutally Kinda hot and a game. And we took the bus, it took forever. And I'm walking into the stadium cursing and I walk in and it's the most exciting event that I have ever seen. And I sat there thinking to myself, you know, the thing that's so amazing about New York is you could play that game in a stadium in New York with virtually any two countries in the world.

Speaker 2:          00:18:08       And the feeling would be exactly the same. And then as I was standing there, you literally couldn't sit down the whole time I thought to myself, well, why has New York, the most international city in the world, I've subsequently been corrected? And it's actually Toronto, believe it or not, but why the mayor of Toronto reinforces that all the time. Why his New York, the thought to be most international city in the world never hosted the most international event, the Olympics. So I left the stadium that day with this vague notion that New York auto host the Olympics. And over the next two years I researched it just on my own, did all sorts of research about what it takes to win. Is it a good thing or bad thing? And I finally had an insight. And ironically the insight came to me from Toronto, which had bid for the 1996 Olympics.

Speaker 2:          00:19:03       We originally were focused on 2008 where what they had done with their plan had placed all of the venues and then plans for the neighborhoods around them, um, on the w on your utilized waterfront. And the key point was at the Olympics could be a catalyst to getting things done that the city had wanted to do but could never generate the political will or the financial wherewithal to get done. And what I finally concluded was you could see the same thing just for bidding for the Olympics. And so what I did was I assembled a team, we built a plan, um, for the city, the physical future of the city where we placed sort of then use proposed venues in the areas that we thought needed the most help, had plans for the areas around them and figure that just by the process of bidding for the Olympics and the deadlines that the bidding process impose, it would create the catalyst to get things done.

Speaker 2:          00:20:07       And that's actually exactly what happened, but kind of by a fluke. So what happened was we developed this plan. This is before I was deputy mayor. The plan, actually I've schlepped it to round to all sorts of business people because I needed money for the bid. One of the people that I actually met in that process was a guy named Mike Bloomberg, um, who gave me some money and went onto our board. Um, actually didn't care at all about it, but he adopted a bunch of the ideas when later on he ran for mayor. And then when in a complete shock, he actually won only because of nine 11. He asked me to join him in city hall and do the things that I'd wanted to do as part of the Olympic bid and get them all approved before the Olympic bid decision three years later. And so that's exactly what we did. So Hudson yards, for example, guys know about Hudson yards. That was a plan. That was originally Olympic plan. The Greenpoint, Williamsburg waterfront was an old part of the Olympic plan, Long Island city, downtown Brooklyn. Um, some of the improvements in flushing and Coney island and Harlem and the South Bronx, all of those were part of those original plans. So you know, we lost, you know, we didn't have the Olympics here. Um, but at the end of the day, you know, we kind of won.

Speaker 1:          00:21:36       But it's interesting that losing the Olympics but having built the infrastructure that the Olympics was supposed to create might be the best economic outcome for an Olympic city. Right. We got to all the, see all, we got all the benefits from your work now we would have had another seven years of deadlines to get other stuff done. Well let's talk and so, and by the way, just so you know, it would have been a great celebration of what New York is, which is sort of my original. There are more Olympics in the future. Nah, I think we've used up all the land. There's almost no place to go. I that's get it off. That's at your predecessor said. Let's talk about, uh, people will find a way. There is one place, but I got my eye there, there, there, there are a couple of areas in, in the book you talk about this where you ultimately lost politically or for whatever reason. Let's, let's talk about a few of those. You wanted to be last week. Yes. I think it's important because it's illustrative of how hard this stuff is, which is always for the average citizen. The average is like why is this so hard? The answer is it's really hard. So let's use the stadium as an example. You worked really hard to get a stadium. Why do we not have a stadium there? Tell it, take us through the stadium.

Speaker 2:          00:22:51       So, um, so those are the guys who weren't here at the time. Um, part of the Hudson yards plan, only one piece of it was to build a Reese called it the New York sports and convention center, which was going to be, uh, an an adjunct to the convention center, but would also serve as the home for the New York jets. It's going to be an amazing facility and we worked really hard to make it happen. Uh, and the reason ultimately didn't happen. It was defeated in Albany, the state capitol. Um, by, uh, really one guy, the one guy's guy named

Speaker 1:          00:23:29       Sheldon silver, who's the speaker of the assembly recently heard his name. We have, because, uh, he was convicted of corruption. Um, and uh, that conviction unfortunately was overturned on a legal technicality. So we are looking

Speaker 2:          00:23:46       forward, I say this very publicly to his retrial,

Speaker 1:          00:23:49       but said, so you have an opinion about Shelton, Mr Mr. Seller? I absolutely do. But in any event,

Speaker 2:          00:23:57       um, you know, he thought, uh, there were several reasons that I think he rejected it because it all came down to one guy. One was was that he had to cozy relationship with Madison Square Garden, which opposed having a competing facility. Um, secondly, he thought our plans for the west side of Manhattan would compete with the plans to redevelop lower Manhattan, which we always said what's crazy New York and handle two big developments at the same time. But his district was in lower Manhattan. Third, um, he was having an affair with the lobbyist, uh, four, four K for Cablevision or so it is reputed on good authority. Um, and uh, fourth his members of his, um, his, uh, democratic caucus who are from the west side who were very supportive of him when there was an attempted coup of him like a couple of years before. Um, we're very much opposed to the steam because they hate everything that, uh, and to this day that is proposed to be done, uh, in their district. And then I will say in the spirit of complete candor was Hubris on, um, my, my side. Um, we always knew he was going to be a problem. We tried to do an end run around the legislature that end run failed. And I think he was basically telling us that he was the real power and swatted us really me down. So it's a combination of all of those.

Speaker 1:          00:25:43       Life is tough, but let's use another example. Governor Christie canceled this tunnel, which in my reading was critically needed. Yup. How does this happen?

Speaker 2:          00:25:54       Well, he did some other things too. Here's how these things happen. It's people, politicians generally have no courage. Okay. And generally speaking, there are, there are clearly exceptions, one of whom I was incredibly proud to serve and there are, there are many others. So what for him, you know, he had like a great first year as governor, um, and he was really popular and he started having what all popular politicians do, uh, dreams and becoming the president. He understood that in order to be a viable Republican candidate, um, he needed to show sort of real sort of fiscal toughness and conservatism. So he ended up this plan to build a new tunnel between New Jersey and New York City. He claimed that he had no confidence that the cost of it, you know, would come in where they said, um, which itself was probably not totally unfair, but he just killed it. And as the single dumbest thing that you could ever do for New Jersey, New Jersey at the end of the day exists because,

Speaker 3:          00:27:11       because two, please continue. By the way, I just in my, in my defense here, I wasn't in my friend's living, I was born in Newark. So, uh, go ahead. What am I saying that my parents made the wise decision to move to Detroit. So, uh, so in any of it,

Speaker 2:          00:27:37       no, I didn't mean New Jersey benefits by virtue of its proximity to New York City. The more people who can get in and out of New York from New Jersey, it's a corollary of my virtuous cycle of growth, grow or die for New Jersey to grow more people have to keep coming

Speaker 1:          00:27:57       in and out. In New York if you want to increase the aggregate growth rate of the metropolitan region, you have to increase its connectivity, right? In all forms. Nope.

Speaker 2:          00:28:05       By the way, you probably read like these tunnels between New York and New Jersey are ancient and there's pose a huge risk and one of them is a hundred years old and it has to be shut down. It's going to collapse now. We're going to spend many times more money. It'll take a lot. We're spending really risking. So speaking of don't live in New Jersey

Speaker 1:          00:28:26       seeking of interconnectivity, um, the city has, so, so the good news is there's more housing, there's more economic activities, more buildings, more travel and its economic growth. And it is really the center of economic growth for America today as a whole. And congratulations.

Speaker 2:          00:28:42       And by the way, during the Bloomberg era, job growth in the city was more than double the national growth rate. Uh, and more, most importantly New York, cause it's a very, it's a cyclical city generally because we're so dependent on financial services tends to go into recession faster and come out slower because the recovery of the financial system and financial services firms tends to be slower in this, um, fit in the financial crisis. The reverse happened because we actually were successful very deliberately in diversifying the economy. So that included, you know, life sciences, higher education where we made lots of investments or

Speaker 1:          00:29:29       yeah, you actually identify what are the things you did in your initial plan as you identified sectors of life sciences, being in a film and television producer in Rockefeller University and those kinds of things. But, but this is a lead up to my, that the good news is you built this incredibly strong city. The bad news is taxes are incredibly high. They're still an affordability housing problem. And the transportation is very difficult. I'm going to use the word sucks now and, and there was a summer of hell, right this, this pens to, and this is one problem after the other. And that's something that the private sector cannot fix, right? It requires sustained coordination across all three states and the city. Is it just going to get worse? So the answer

Speaker 2:          00:30:13       is hopefully not. Um, and I should, let's talk, we talked a little bit about affordability where it said, I think the city just grew faster. Um, then for then we were able to produce housing. Um, talk about kind of transportation system. I will say that from the mass transit system, um, it's not the city's fault. Um, and the reason is the mass transit systems controlled by the state. And you know, we talked about, we had one other big failure and that failure was back in 2007 as part of what we called plan YC, which was New York sustainability plan, which is our plan for the physical future of the city. Looking out over 25 years. Um, we proposed a completely different approach to mass transit, a core piece of which was going to be congestion pricing. For those of you who've been in London or maybe Singapore, you know that when you enter a zone, um, the, uh, you pay a in a car, I'm not taxis, but private vehicles, you actually pay a fee.

Speaker 2:          00:31:27       We proposed and $8 fee below 86th street in Manhattan and it was ultimately going to generate like $1 billion a year. And we promised, um, that all of that would be given to the MTA, which we don't even control, which is run by the state, run by the state, could be bonded, combined with an additional annual contribution in the city would make and the state would make, um, could fund $50 billion in mass transit improvements and all of it would have been guaranteed. And we even specify what lines we're going to get added, what subway stations we're going to get improved. You know, how much greater frequency bus rapid transit, like a whole plan. But the core of it was congestion pricing. And by the way, just in terms of statistics, this gives you a sense for how politics actually works among in the districts of the legislators because this had to get approved in Albany who we're going to be most affected by congestion pricing.

Speaker 2:          00:32:29       The ones typically like on the outer boroughs, um, on the other side of the river. Um, literally like 5% of constituents drove into Manhattan and 95% would have benefited from these mass transit improvements. But again, it was defeated by the same guy up in Albany. Um, and will you have an opinion? Well, I have an opinion about now what is interesting as result of the summer of how and all the underfunding of the transit system, the idea of congestion pricing are totally the bridges coming back. So the good news, I guess they still have to solve this problem. Let me ask you one final quick question. Good news is we'll eventually be proven to be correct. Okay. The bad news is it'll probably happen 15 years later, but um, yeah. Usually when you push problems off, they physically are you sure you're better off fixing them. Now I have one final question and I'd like to ask the audience for your comments or questions. Um, what's the weirdest or funniest thing Donald Trump did with you?

Speaker 2:          00:33:38       Uh, I'll tell you two quick stories that I think, um, illustrate my general rule that people just don't change. And everything we're saying was ultimately predictable. And I will point out that I actually had a pretty good relationship with them. But you know what? Columbus circle. Um, so the city actually, I inherited a piece of property, um, that we decide we're going to sell off this in 2002 when we had no money. And in the previous administration, they'd gone through a process and they'd selected Trump who is going to build a luxury boutique gold plated hotel. And so we decided we ought to see what else is out there. So we went out, we did an RFP and there were really two bitters for it. One was, um, Trump who wanted to build the same gold plated hotel. I actually don't remember for sure that it was gold play, but you can imagine it would have been. And um, and the other was a small museum that wanted to move to a more prominent location on Columbus Circle. And this, this building had been a museum. So anyway, so we get the bids and Trump offers all cash, a lot more money. Um, and uh, we'll pay today or that, you know, right away. And the museum, which had no money offered to pay less money, would pay when they could raise it, um, if the, if they could. So needless to say, we chose the museum.

Speaker 2:          00:35:13       So now you can imagine the call with Trump to inform him that, um, we had selected this pathetic little museum, which by the way, if you haven't been to the Museum of art and design is a great museum. So you can imagine sort of how that call went and you know, but this is the more interesting story. I did not hear a word from him for like another 15 months until the day after the apprentice debuted on NBC. And I get a call the next day from him out of the blue. And the entire point of the call was for him to tell me the ratings of the apprentice.

Speaker 2:          00:36:03       I literally had not heard from the guy for 15 months and I could not have been number like 1000 on his list, but was more amazing. Was he called me every week like clockwork for the next three weeks to tell me the rate. Are you sure he didn't confuse you with a different, I don't think so. So here's the final thing, which we'll again, we'll tell you everything you need to know. So on the day I die, I, we announced that I was leaving city hall to go to Bloomberg. I sent out a note to like a thousand people, you know, who I'd worked with saying what a great experience and an honor, blah, blah, blah. It was, and

Speaker 2:          00:36:46       yeah, attached the press release of all the great things that we did. Um, and like hundreds of people wrote back these incredibly nice notes. I mean, it was, it was really moving. So I get one back from, from, uh, from Trump. And, uh, what he had done was he had a scammed printed out and scanned my email, um, after and then circled on it. No, say wrote, great job, exclamation point, exclamation, some big felt tip pen. And then down below there was a little typo in my email to him. That was actually two periods at the end of a sentence. He circled it. This is the guy who spells taps with two P's. He circled it and put an exclamation point on. How do you explain that since from our audience? My question is, how can the city, uh, arrest control from Albany in order to do some of the things that you've described? Well, one option would be to succeed.

Speaker 2:          00:37:59       I was known to privately advocate that from time to time the answer is actually a more creeping takeover. Um, so I talk a little bit in the book about a governor's island and Brooklyn Bridge Park. You guys all been to governor's island, Brooklyn Bridge Park. So, um, we actually, um, bought both governors island and the land underlying governor's island and Brooklyn Bridge Park in partnership with the state. Um, early on, literally in the first six months to a of the Bloomberg administration and managing it with the state. Both of them was awful. Um, you know, they wouldn't share information, they are incredibly slow, bureaucratic, whatever, and it was really frustrating. So, uh, eventually I got so frustrated that I brought a team together and we developed a plan, which we called Project Repo, uh, to buy the state out of its interests in governor's island and Brooklyn Bridge Park. And at first week we close to having a deal.

Speaker 2:          00:39:14       Um, when our governor Pataki was governor then Eliot Spitzer name, many of you may remember who was governor for about 15 months until he had a sex scandal. Um, he didn't want anything to do with it. He was so insistent on state control over literally as much as possible. And so we waited and this happened after I left for his successor to come when the city's position, after the financial crisis was stronger than the states. And my successor actually agreed to buy their out their interests and no intimate too to a large degree, that incredible public spaces that, um, Brooklyn Bridge Park and governor's island are as a result of that decision to buy them out. So the reality is beyond like weird situations like that, the truth is we just have to do our best job. In fact, I would say one of my great regrets, I joke a lot about the state is that I should have been up in Albany a lot more, um, being nice to those guys.

Speaker 2:          00:40:19       Um, instead, the path I chose was to ignore them as much as possible. And for the most part that worked fine. The couple of times I talked about didn't work so well. Yeah. All right, next question. Where do you live? Upper west side. Upper West. We're neighbors. Yes. Originally from the suburbs of Detroit. And understand you grew up there as well. Which one? Uh, from Huntington Woods. My brother lives in Huntington against. What can Detroit learn from New York City? That's a great question. Um, and uh, uh, I actually gave a speech about this every year. Detroit has like this homecoming event for people who fled Detroit, you know, and, and you know, Bidwell somewhere else and they want to get them encouraged. By the way, I should say, I think Detroit is actually on the upswing, but I, I did give this speech and I actually, um, analogize Detroit, not to New York City, but instead to Harlem, which has begun to see a real renaissance.

Speaker 2:          00:41:22       And I, I gave like four pieces of advice. The first is at the end of the day, where you really make progress is not on the stadiums or even the shiny downtown, which is fine. It's in the neighborhoods. And so you really got to focus on the little stuff of building neighborhoods, making them safer, improving education, clearing out the vacant lots, all of which, by the way, I think the current mayor who's really good, it focused on second is you can't be impatient. You know, when, when I was born, I'm older than you. Um, in 1958, Detroit had 1.8 5 million people. Today the population is maybe 650,000, so it took 60 years to get into this mess and it's going to take several generations. And so what you have to actually be his patient. The third piece of advice is you gotta be diverse. Um, you know, Detroit, the population is essentially shrunk so much that a lot of the people left are the ones who really couldn't leave.

Speaker 2:          00:42:29       And so, you know, the percentage that have any sort of college education is extremely low. Um, and what you need to do is reflate the city and the way you reflate the cities by being more diverse. And some of that is, you know, people being attracted back to the city from the suburbs. I think a big part of it is really encouraging immigration. Um, but again, you grow or you die. Detroit is the exact opposite of what we hope to do here in New York. And I'd say, you know, the last part is Troy can't do it alone. It's gotten relatively meager help from the federal government to go through. It's bail out. It went through bankruptcy to go through. It's valid. It did get help from the state. Um, and there's complicated political issues between the city and the state. Harlem as an example, had New York City, we invested, you know, I'm guessing over time, billions of dollars in housing in Harlem, incredibly trends and, and it is, um, it's really transformed. And so a lot of that wasn't affordable housing. So it's those four things. Let's go ahead. Yes, sir. Where do you live?

Speaker 4:          00:43:39       I actually grew up in the West village. My first job for five years actually worked for community board to posting zoning signs. Uh, so very familiar with that. Uh, and I currently live in Brooklyn Heights. Um, I guess so my question having grown up in the city and having seen so much of the transformation during my lifetime, um, you know, neighborhood that I grew up in is now very different from the one that used to be and is now starting to contemplate home buying myself. Let me ask you, in a great tradition of New York, you know, conversation, where would, where would you be excited about as a value buy in the city?

Speaker 5:          00:44:15       Ah, and why?

Speaker 4:          00:44:19       Because I also know you play three dimensional chess. Really? Why as opposed to where you would want us to move.

Speaker 5:          00:44:24       Okay. We're giving

Speaker 2:          00:44:27       you advice. Um, and I will concede, I'm slightly out of date on this and you, what you were really looking for is value place where I think assuming the continued growth occurs, you'll see the fastest growth or probably be in the South Bronx. Um, and there's a reason for that one, it's really close to Manhattan, midtown Manhattan or Manhattan. If find the right place, it's on the subway. There's some interesting building stock there. You're starting to see it happen. It's gotten dramatically safer. That would be certainly one area. Uh, you know, it's Kinda late now for places in northern Manhattan like Washington heights and that area there. But I think that's a great neighborhood. Yeah. You can just take the subway map, always look at the, take a subway map and look at the relative rents, right. And then decide where you are and then make a judgment of how they'll appreciate.

Speaker 2:          00:45:25       Yeah. The closer you are to Manhattan, I think, um, uh, from a mass trans, that's where the greatest value. So look at the relative value relative to the distance. And that's where you'll generally find pretty much any place in New York now though is dramatically more livable than it was 15 years ago. One of your, one of Mike's priorities was in fact the Bronx in general. We have, you know, we had this whole five borough strategies. So, um, you know, and what I'm really proud ist of is said, the areas that we invested the most in have seen the most dramatic increases in job creation and business formation, um, as well. So, um, you know, look, I also find, you know, big parts of Queens to be very compelling. It depends on how easy it is to get into get into Manhattan. And by the way, I'm not saying that you have to have access to Manhattan, the heat. He's, he was federal property values, property value. Yeah. We, this is the financial industry, a lot of that. Yes sir. Where do you sunset parks and other one.

Speaker 6:          00:46:35       Hey, I'm Steve. I live in Williamsburg. Yeah. I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about the reality of construction costs in New York. Um, and I, I mean that because you talked about revenue sources that don't exist. You talked about Christie killing the tunnel project because of sort of political considerations, but our costs, there seems to be a persistent gap between the estimation and the reality.

Speaker 2:          00:46:57       It's probably not the estimation in the reality. It's just that costs here are way too high. And um, and if you compare like building us, typically a s like a high rise building in New Jersey versus New York City, um, it's like 35% difference, 35%, and at the same labor force, same basic labor of wines at 35% more expensive. The biggest issue is it's actually not the, this different labor rules. And so the Labor in New York City are infinite for union work are infinitely more generous than they are in New Jersey. And that's just like years of contractors, you know, who negotiate with the unions basically giving away a lot more. Um, and um, big part of that, it's not so much the wage is per se, it is the feather bedding. It is the work rules that make it just a lot more expensive. Um, so the question is what do you do about that?

Speaker 2:          00:48:06       And the presumably with that 35% applies to affordable housing as well. Well, it's, this is the interesting question. Um, it does in many cases because the city's rules require when it's spent, when it is using its money to pay for something in some form, it tends to require La Union labor be used. And that's kind of a political thing. What's happening though is that, um, nonunion labor is becoming much more common. The percentage of buildings that are built with UDN labour in the city is actually coming down. So the market is kind of working, but it's not really an efficient market because there are all these rules that basically government imposes. As a side question, do you have an opinion about the 57 street corridor and all the huge apartment complexes that are unsold and occupying my visual space? You know, I look, I think, um, uh, one in particular is hideously ugly.

Speaker 2:          00:49:12       So that's a problem happened after I was there. Just to be clear. Um, you know, look, I have a, there's a, there's a couple of things wrapped up in that. One is are the buildings too tall? And you know, I have two minds of that. One is they're kind of not in context and for Central Park. And the view from central park. On the other hand, you know, I do believe that New York is an aspirational city and should be reaching basically for the sky. Um, you know, ever hire. Um, the second part is whether I actually care that there's a bunch of billionaires buying, um, apartments there and not living there. And the truth and matter is I actually don't care so much because that was never going to be a place where there's going to be like affordable housing or anything. And the more economic activity that we can generate here that helps [inaudible] construction workers or other people, that's a good thing. Eventually what I do regret is there were tax abatements for some of those buildings that probably shouldn't have been there, but eventually they'll start paying taxes. So I don't really see it like soaking up the man because you've got this rarefied group of people who are going to be paying lots of money creating economic activity and it wouldn't affect anything else. Where do you live?

Speaker 1:          00:50:42       All right. I live in the West village and I'm originally from Oakland, California. Um, so I was working at Google in mountain view for five years and then I moved out here two and a half years ago. I have an affordable housing question. Uh, so in New York I've seen that there seems to be much greater affordable housing stock out here versus where I come from in the bay area. I was wondering if you were advising policy makers in the San Francisco Bay area, what best practices from New York and affordable housing would you reckon?

Speaker 2:          00:51:13       Great. It's a great, it's a great question. So New York and the bay area really different for several reasons, but the most important of which is, you know, New York, um, city, um, is one city and we can think very comprehensively over a large area. Um, now it's not the region. Um, but New York City is a big entity and so we sort of saw the whole city as a canvas and could target. The problem I think in the bay area is the biggest one is one of governance, right? So you've got all these different towns and cities, all of which have their own particular view about how little development and usually it is little development that they actually want. Um, and um, as a result, you can't be comprehensive in the way that you think about it and you, um, delegate enormous power over the capacity to grow and create that supply to individual governmental units.

Speaker 2:          00:52:26       And that is sort of the biggest problems. So I'd say the number one thing that they could do there is actually figure out a way it'll never happen. But regional planning, okay. This other absent that is, you know, each one of those jurisdictions is Gunna have to become much more, um, friendly to growing supply. Uh, but they, you know, the problem is, is that like the transportation systems, you know, just keep, can't keep up. There's no reached real great planning there either. And so you can't accommodate the demand. And so the bay area feels on every level like a pressure cooker. Um, and you know, until you solve the governance issue, until you actually are able to think regionally about the things that accommodate demand, um, it's not going to change and it's probably only gonna get worse until quality of life declined so much that people aren't going to want to be there anymore. Now, you know, some places are more enlightened. I mean, look at San Jose for example in Google's plans for San Jose. You know, hopefully that will be a little bit of a release valve for the area. Same thing, you know, in Sunnyvale and stuff. But it's, it's a real problem.

Speaker 1:          00:53:52       Um, this issue is a huge issue for our employees in the bay area is yes, you will know we've run out of time, but we have three people who have been standing. So maybe we could have each of you say where you are from and ask your question then you can,

Speaker 2:          00:54:05       yeah, I'll do it. I'll do it.

Speaker 1:          00:54:07       Creative answers. Go ahead. Yeah. Where do you live and what's your question?

Speaker 7:          00:54:09       I live in upper east side and I grew up in Elmhurst, queens, dance with the CEO again earlier. Talk about governance. And so like if I look at China, so they have the Beijing autonomous kind of governance, the same who Shanghai and the US. We kind of have that with Washington DC, you know, in terms of really innovating in the cities. Now what if we could push for the u s recognize certain cities like New York as its own special economic unit. That way it could be freed from upstate New York to actually innovate.

Speaker 2:          00:54:38       The same is true by the way in Germany. There are a number of federal states that are essentially cities. Look, I think it could be great. I mean the city also gives a lot more money to the state than it actually gives back. But the one thing that you generally recognize about governments is they very rarely, um, devolve power, um, unless they're desperate. So, you know, it's, it's great thing to think about, but better happened. You've been waiting. Sorry sir.

Speaker 1:          00:55:08       Uh, where do you live and what's your

Speaker 8:          00:55:10       Brooklyn Heights? I begrudgingly moved to Jersey City because it was more affordable. Um, my question is this, there is a disproportionate amount of the population concentrated in cities. Do you think that trend will continue or will things like autonomous cars, teleworking or anything of that sort of caused the influx to reverse basically, where do you think populations there'll be concentrated more moving forward?

Speaker 2:          00:55:32       Um, well you've already actually starting to see a little bit of a movement back to particularly around high cost urban centers, um, back to the suburbs or even excerpts. Uh, so I, I don't think it's going to be through this dramatic rush where everyone, like in America is going to move into the cities. I think people want choice and it's good that they actually have choice. I think the question that you asked about things like autonomous cars and whether that's going to encourage, um, city dwelling or it's going to encourage longer commutes a will to some extent be a function of the way in which we incentivize the use of those vehicles. You know, are we going to try and actually discourage having too many cars on the, are we going to, you know, we don't know. And so, uh, I don't, I think it's hard to tell and if you read all the literature about it, it's, it's really kinda up in the air.

Speaker 2:          00:56:35       I'm a believer in cities because I do believe that for a very high percentage of people, they have a real desire for contact and community that has to be face to face. Not Everybody views that other people view having a lot more green space. I also think that when we do have autonomous vehicles, we're going to be able to carve back a lot more space for open space and make our cities if we handle it well, um, more livable. So I'm a total optimist about cities, but I don't think they're the only answer. That's how our final question, where do you live?

Speaker 1:          00:57:12       Where's she live? On the upper west side and I'm actually also from the suburbs of Detroit. Where are you from? Oh, that's further out, right? It's still, yeah. Um, my question is that like, regarding like gentrification, there's concerns that, you know, the people who already lived there are getting pushed out or that they feel that they're not really in the community anymore. Uh, how do you find, uh, you know, a balance when you're making these developments that, you know, you're, you're sparing growth, but you're also not like excluding

Speaker 2:          00:57:48       yeah. You don't look, I actually think, um, while gentrification or affordability or related, they're not completely overlapping. I generally believe that gentrification is a good thing. Um, and I believe gentrification can occur with out unduly compromising affordability. I believe that for a number of reasons. One is a very high percentage of units in this city, literally like a million, have some form of rent control on them. Um, and that acts as a real, um, a buffer against rising prices. I think though, the real answer at the end of the day is to continue to build more housing. Um, but you know, when you talk about gentrification, um, it brings real benefits to that. People don't talk about the people who've been there for a long time, who own their homes or apartments. They're worth a lot more. There are many better services. I think the most important thing is economic opportunity in terms of jobs being created.

Speaker 2:          00:58:59       Um, tend to, um, um, be greatest in areas that are gentrifying, which creates opportunity for people. Um, you know, as, as I mentioned before in the areas that we focused on with affordable housing now in central Brooklyn, like Bedford Stuyvesant in the South Bronx, yeah, in central Harlem where we invested a huge amount of money to hopefully make housing markets work, but most of it was affordable. We saw a huge increases in job growth and business production with meaningful declines in unemployment rates and there really isn't a ton of evidence to indicate that people were actually forced out of their homes. Instead, what we do is we just created more.

Speaker 1:          00:59:42       So if you judge the city I the starting point, January, 2002 or roughly nine 11, I think you can see that Dan's contribution was extraordinary. His office today is in one of the buildings that he helped design and promote. Right. And you are a genuine sort of a Patriot and lover of our city, so thank you guys so much for this and his book

Speaker 3:          01:00:07       greater than ever. Thank you. [inaudible] we have books in the back. Okay, good. Great.
