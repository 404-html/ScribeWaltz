Speaker 1:          00:09          Hi everyone. Thank you. I'm very glad to be here and it's a bit impressive. That's also very presence to be able to share this experience that was very um, uh, a milestone in my life. First of all, we are in September, 2016 and I'm working in the streets on the pedestrian and the sidewalks and I won't like to cross the streets. So I come close to something that looks like a pedestrian crossing and at the exact moments I placed my foods and the pavements a car or on blast through there, I jumped back to come back to the works as a cow first by just right in front of me. I look and guess my art is a bit stamping loudly and I realize that I've been very close from a very important accidents I haven't seen that's a, there were a car coming by. I hadn't seen that.

Speaker 1:          01:19          It was not a total pedestrian crossing. In fact, it was the middle of the street intersection. And if I hadn't seen all of this is because I was blind and it is a picture of me for one week in September, 2016 and you would wonder maybe why someone would glide blindfold inside himself. Pretty sample. I have a friend who is Brian Charlie and she has an accident. Maybe you know, it should take the train quite often, you know, there is sometimes a separation, a gap between the train and the platform. And if you don't mind, you could fell. You can fall into. And that's what happened. She fell, Eh, it's a one, an RF meter deep. Uh, she's fine today. But at this moment it's very moved me inside and I realize, okay, I know you were in the robotic field for years. Uh, in the French liberty cap.

Speaker 1:          02:23          We train robots and we teach them how to avoid obstacles gap. How could we do it for robots and not for blind? It makes sense for me to try to transfer a lot of a bit of technology that are using in autonomous cars to try to apply it to human being. So that was the starting point. And I figured out that if I want to solve kind of problem, I actually understand it. So the, the first abuse main that I found was to try to live for one week, Brian. It's like a simulation and experience of cross. It's nuts. Truly what Brian Pr person will experiments because it's, there are some factors that are uh, that occurs only after a weeks and especially if you are blind from, from birth. But it was very interesting and if you want to try it, I recommend you to try it for only 20 minutes on 20 minutes. It's very, very instructive. It was the worst week of my life clearly and sort of a nightmare. Um, unsure SPEC. And if I'm here today is to share you three main discoveries I've made and three discoveries that drives me today or in all of my projects, uh, including my startup. First of all, I would like to guide you through a journey. I will take this tool, which is a white can.

Speaker 1:          04:02          You will close your eyes and I will be your guide to discover as treats in the, in the region, in the Paris area. So close your eyes and listen to my voice. You are on the sidewalk. The wall from the building you would just left is on your right and side on your left. You know that there is a road. You all in your white Jen until the until you're right and and you can feel the pavement under your feet. It's summer, it's warm. You're wearing a tee shirt and a light win is bringing you the sounds of a cafetiere Ross nearby. It's a pleasant sensation you decide to move on as you're working. Your wife, Jen is doing. It's zigzag. Dan's head of you in order to protect you from any obstacle. It's taping on the ground and on the world on a regular basis.

Speaker 1:          05:10          By doing this, you feel sure you can keep working straightforward without veering off. Everything is perfect. Suddenly on your left ear allowed roaring sound. A car probably just passed by on the road, so honestly the noise was so defeat defunding. You could have believe it was driving right on the side work. You go and work it. You gain confidence and you step away from the world. Just a little in order to move more freely. When all of us students, you're white Chen, it's something strongly you surprised taping on this on thing and then checking it with two hand. It feels like a big tree trench by being a bit more careful. You realize that you can eat a little birds singing. They seem to have a lot of fun right above your hand. Your ad, this is, it validates your theory of the tree. You concluded that all of those nice little birds must be playing on the branches, which probably belonged to the trees that are on the side. Work on your left. You decide to get around the tree by sticking to the middle of the sidewalk and you resume your journey. Three steps, five steps.

Speaker 1:          06:46          Oh, you can. It's something again and this time it's a metal things. The Sun is very sharp, almost Chris timing light. It's some, it sounds like this thing is something very light. You're tapping on it and oh yes. Oh yes, I know. What is it? It's a chair. Your cane is stuck and you've gotten cage into a characteristic of a cafe. You can open your eyes again. How was it pleasant or not? This street is the street just next to my home presence. Yeah, and I'd like to point to point an interesting fact in all of this description, maybe you notice it, there is, there were no visual element only sound smelling, temperature touching, no, no visual elements. But I'm pretty sure everyone here at the clear view, a clear representation of the streets of what's happening. Interesting now, interesting to notice that the brain is able to create a mental representation of something you've never been there somewhere.

Speaker 1:          08:11          It never be on there and without any education of how to build it. And that's the first discovery for me. During this one week, I was first thinking that I would be in the drug into darkness for one week, but in fact I wasn't. If you should close your eyes for more than a few minutes, you realize that your brain starts to put your memories in front of you and you start moving around literally into your past and into what you know. So in every known areas I was able to work through my memories was very surprising but of course this also have limitations. When someone in, for example in this room, if you move something or if you are working on the sidewalk and the scooter is parked on the side work, the amount of representation and the reality is not in sync and your visualization vanished so you are not in the darkness.

Speaker 1:          09:21          My point is when I try to to launch myself into new project, I think first hour now what are you doing? You've never been there. You have, you don't. You can't give a talk in English, you're not good enough in English and then I rethink and we thinking it's good because we all have more resources inside of us. More that we tend to think and when our limitations are rich. For example, when my mental transition is not quite sync with the reality, there is one option, natural option, ask for help and it's a good idea to ask for help. It, this is the second discovery I would like to share with you. You know the Darwin theory, I think it's quite known, well known. I think often it's a bit meaningless. Misunderstood. Darwin is about evolution and we often think that evolution is a competition. The best pieces will evolve and survive, but in fact the kids who suck to success is not competition is cooperation. Why our society is successful today is because we have been able to cooperate, operate together and this is the discovery I've made during this week. I was not alone. We're human being is capable of an amazing capacity, capability of empathy and compassion.

Speaker 1:          10:58          And I would like to share you a quartz from a colleague of mine in Palatine. In my startup, we have a sort of tradition. Every new colleague, I'm pretty, I have to live 24 hours blind to, to feel it. What it is, it's not to mock is not to to simulate anything more. That's okay. You join us and you have to to realize deep inside you that we try to solve a human problem. We are not building a tech tool. We are building something that will help people. And after this 24 hour experience, it taught me this. There's 24 hours in the dark re candid, my face in human nature.

Speaker 2:          11:45          Okay.

Speaker 1:          11:46          We all have this um, situation. You are in the mutual, in Paris on the morning, everyone with the head down looking at the screen of the smart phones and we avoid eye contact the most as we can. And often we can wonder if something very bad happened. Would someone raise up the Ed the head to look at me and ask me? I can assure you that in a distressful situation, every way, everything changes, everything changes and leave quite a lot of distressful situations during this week into gives you a bit of context. I leave, um, 30 kilometer away from Paris, about one hour and a half, uh, to, to commute morning and in the nights and during this week I would like to do a regular walks with scheduling meetings in Paris, in everywhere. And of course I got lost a lot and one of this expensive, it's pretty, pretty interesting. I was in the, in the station a lost and I was very cushion with everything. When you're blind, you very caution with everything you listen to. Uh, to paper on the fruit. You listen two steps from Ozark persons, you are try to figure out what's around you. I'm asking hello, is there, I knew anybody or I need help. And I uh, a young lady not far 10. Yes, I'm coming. She's coming to help me and she does something very surprising. She thinks my end,

Speaker 1:          13:39          well not the very tactile, that team in our society don't free do you have this situation where big elevator empty the drawers open, man, step in and your works cross to u s m stop ear. She was centimeter away from your face. Did you have this acquired moments? And as I said in this twist for moments, everything changes. When she took my end, I was nuts. I was not, I was happy. In fact, I was happy. It was very full of tenderness and I feel like a wave of energy coming from Er. And I'm very glad because I recalled this moment and would like to show you, I had the Gopro camera on the torso. So this is the station and we can see the the girl. Yeah we've, it's fun

Speaker 1:          14:39          and I'm waiting and she took my hand and in straight. Interesting is probably I would in a regular situation, never talked to her. Also person she offers me ALP naturally those guys very, very nice. I was again lost and maybe we would never have course it's, there were often people love about them. Self willing to help me and a bit a quality. Trying to take my aunt to move me often pushing me. Not a good idea but definitely people were very, very nice to me. And it's, I think it's good to remember that human being have a lot of good thing deep inside maybe in our society. So bits, Hi Eden. And because we are all stressed, we are all in lack of time we go fast but in distress for moments, it's good to know that we can count on each other. And when I, I know start a project, I often try to re to rethink what are my capabilities. But I also try to think that in all situation there will be someone ready to help. I think it's very relaxing in important to get to keep it in line. And first, third one tell discovery is the most important one and important one.

Speaker 1:          16:24          A bit of background details. When I jump into this week, I had clearly no idea about what would happen. I had one or two hours of training with the wide chain. We've with a friend of me of my and then a jumping. But after bumping into walls, bumping into and fire hydrants, you know, you need 93 remembers it. Uh, getting lost. I think the feeling of being abandoned and yes, stepping into a dog poop took the abuse with it. Smelling this disgusting smelling and feeling the passengers reproached full look at me and finally being run over, nearly run over by a car. I knew exactly what it would be. It was the first day and trust me on the second morning when I had to to go out, I was terrified. And even today when I look at the, the, the recording from this week, I can feel my stomach because it was very terrifying.

Speaker 1:          17:46          I think it's kind of traumatic to do it. So as I said, 20 minutes, not more, but that is said there is a powerful, powerful discovery bi in this on the morning I take my shoes, I take the camera, I closed the door. I think the inviter I go in front of the drew of my building and then I was stuck. Petrified can do any more moved and I don't know how much time does it take, but at certain points when I opened the door and I step out, everything vanished. I mean the fear tends to stop you to stop me and when you jump out, when you jump, the FIA is still here, but the power is vanished. That's why I like to say the first step is always the more difficult one, but also the more important one. And it runs for everything, I think projects but also spots and everything.

Speaker 1:          18:58          Immobility, polarize. Whereas movements liberates action. Chicks out fear. And that's good to know. I unfounded in panda or startup, we have a motto, it's the French word salts, which mean leap English or jump. And the first letter from from salt is s, which stands for sacrifice. It's a strong word, but a first step. The first leap is always a sacrifice, but it's what's cost to Jen and I was, I also like the motor from the first RPA or military in French. It's a Kiehl's Gal. [inaudible] win. This is it you, you'd ask you when you jump and direction chicks funeral outs. So this is the point I've been trying to make. We all have dreams.

Speaker 1:          19:59          Maybe it's taking a trip around the world. Start Your own business, take a new artistic ob, take on a sprouting challenge, volunteer with an Ngo, even going vegetarian, tested, whatever the challenge is. I know, believe that this I have. If I think it's enough and it's come to my mind quite often I have to rethink to stop and to rethink why I am not acting on it. And if we are unnecessary, if I am honest, always the reason why I don't move, it's sphere only fear. That's why the first step, the first step is for me, very important.

Speaker 1:          20:43          The first step is always a sacrifice, but let's, let's make a parent is ear about dreams. I like dreams. I think them quite seriously and I know drink in France, a lot of persons. You remember some famous dream Martin Luther King for example. A dream can influence a lot of people in dreams. Always funny. It's fascinating, fascinating me. Maybe you have been called a dreamer in the past I've been and I think there is a huge difference between dreaming and planning. I can dream all of my life going for a trip around the room and doing nothing. I can plan to go for a trip to trip around the world and starting it by typing on Google how to go for a trip around the world. The difference is that an issue if I dream today, I tried to dream seriously with an of power when the NF conviction passion to turn them into an PR, into plans that we'll be able to, to inspire millions of people. I think that's the the most wonderful thing with dreams. In conclusion, I embarked in this and virtual without knowing what I was doing. Clary as far as a, not fun at the beginning but in fact I've discovered a lot of our things on me and users and those three discoveries are not driving me for all of the projects I can. I can lead first. I have more resource in me and we all have more resource in our that what re tends to think.

Speaker 1:          22:36          This is one of my principal today and I encourage you when you want to start a project to rethink about your capability. Often we can do more to corporation is key to success. For me it's the most important discovery. We are not alone and we can choose to be this helper for someone that is building something new that is leading a project and I've decided to, whenever I am, wherever I do, whatever I do to be this and to help someone that will maybe contact me and I knew that we'd be able to and some someone else on the project. I have to learn. I had to lead and self discovery. The first step is always the most important one and the most difficult one. Also. Um, I keep fighting against me against procrastination, against, um, my tends to put off my dream till tomorrow, but I take them very seriously and I take all my efforts to convert my dream into plants and often sometime it creates a startup. I'm convinced that some of us today we'll take that leap of faith that will trigger a major discoveries, major initiative that we positively impacted millions of people. So I would like to conclude with a quote from Mr Chak noise that I'm sure you, you love like me and you said there really is a hero in all of us. We've all been designed by God to be a blessing to many an arrow to some bud. There is only one way to go there. Do I think we can choose to be around starting today? Thank you.

Speaker 3:          24:37          Yeah, I left. So I like to have some questions about the credits cause I can talk about your experience best support, inspiring. That's what it would feel like. How he's bored. Okay. Up Cook meat.

Speaker 1:          24:51          Yes. Um, Bhanda is today to the sixth iteration of the product. First of all, we were designing sort of new class sort of gloves and you know, when you prototype something you'll give it to someone and you say, okay, it's good. No, it's good, it's bad. You just, it's just nice to you. And so we tried a lot and now we are building uh, headsets which goes around the neck. We have a little camera rotten. He came around my, like a drone one in the side, which is about to record. I'll take pictures of Jennifer environments and to explain it to the blind user. The idea is to, um, two l per persons in walk areas, scores, public transportations by reading signs, uh, papers and two by identifying objects, recovering them. If they fall under Ron of issue. Dex Can, or I don't know how your desk is clean or not, but you can then ask him on that to find an item that you, that you have to take. But the idea behind it is, this is Paula today. But my goal is not to create like this. My goal is to help people to, to regain their autonomy. Maybe tomorrow it will be something totally different and I'm fine with it and hopefully one day will be useless because if we do our walk a call, actually we will be able to, to teach person to leave without powder because it's kind of a reeducation process. Yes. Great question.

Speaker 3:          26:41          So I had never thought of it. When you, it, it seems almost obvious

Speaker 4:          26:44          to your self driving cars and it almost seems obvious compliant people would have this and I know they don't cause I don't know any blind person who has the similar technology to self driving car. Did you find other projects doing things like this when you started or is it really just uh,

Speaker 1:          27:00          yeah, a few projects, most of them came from laboratories and the goal is not to have a project behind just a demonstration of African Jew. The challenge is to adapt what's the science says, what are the result of experiments into an affordable products for a teeny market. And this challenge, uh, explains what the, why the result, not that much project today and not that much project, especially for kids. And what we know today is kids is the key because the brain, how it's evolved, the kief phase is between six to 10 years old. If you act on this particular stage of development, you can take a giant leap for the future of the person. And if you miss it or if you try to act later, you will be on a sort of transactional item and you will be dependent of the tool. And even if it's a good tool, it's more to be autonomous. And our idea is to teach people personnel to, to go to fishing without giving fish all the time.

Speaker 3:          28:18          Oh, do you think help you pursue that objective? You must know what our services, we have media that you will have also many other projects about cloud or do you think we could do more to help you to, to reach you on?

Speaker 1:          28:43          I think one of the key points is a technological, uh, artificial intelligence is one of the center of conduct today. And we know that Google is doing a lot of research in this field in particular in computer vision. So that could be um, an important step in forward if we were able to yes. To share resources we are using also Google products and then of course there are are are always the um, the capability to generate trust around you and especially true for a tech startup in this early stage.

Speaker 4:          29:23          Do you think we keep your users stuck into uh, like your product or already helping them to uncover more sense

Speaker 3:          29:34          and the surroundings? Yes. This is the question. It's more like a, what do you add that to your situation that being bled? There is a project that he's here and helps you

Speaker 1:          29:50          downloads of justification and explanation needed to zip into this question. But few key points. First, the brain is designed to use to, to use military stories. At the same time, universities use only one issue. See you tends to ear issue smell you send to local to, to find the location of the, the smell always. It's a combination. And even for the proprioception, when you touch something with your fit or rocks together. So you can't just replace one sense by another because if you do so you, you are, um, action, the brain natural working. So the idea is to work the same way the brain is naturally working. And if you do so by training a person on panda, you won't try needs for natural situation also. And then the, the second idea is to show that what's, uh, the feedbacks that came that come from GFI months and to help person to seem to be in control of the feedbacks that comes.

Speaker 1:          31:07          For example, panda is always sleeping. It's not proactive, it's only reaction. So we have stimulation to help, especially kids to move. But it's always the person that will ask for information and process it. It's important and unimportant topic that we have to address one day is this. Um, this issue with blind kids have not the simulator the stimulation from the eyes. You see children doing a lot of mess when they are a little because the experiments mater motorization of their muscle, um, uh, precision of the movement. And this is called the, this is creating feedback loops between the muscles and what you perceive of Shimmer. Sir, if you don't see your movements, you lose a lot of calibration of your own body. And this calibration is important because it will help you to be more comfortable in the world, in your move, in your social interaction.

Speaker 1:          32:16          So one important thing we have to achieve with powder is to try to recreate sort of artificial, um, feedback loops that will add p person to calibrate themselves and then have fully panda will be more and more, less and less useful. Of course, there are a lot of things that you won't be able to, to do reading, especially I don't see fighting, uh, faces when they are far from you. But for the war majority of movements, the idea is to motivates person, giving it side give, give them, um, success. Also 12, 10 through to go forward throw photo. And by the way, that's why we're working with Ubisoft on this topic to create a sort of video game experience, but not to do again, but experience of, um, of winning, getting success in the real, in a virtual environment to then translate to reality. Long answer,

Speaker 3:          33:27          one question from doing that week that you were buying, were you, did you, uh, I'm sure you've identified a lot of problems that are not technology problems that can be sold somewhere else. Like, like for instance, if I'm buying at night, I'm in a metro station, I have no idea. Like where's the exit? Right. What other things did you, um, from all of those problems that you address, did you, I dunno, contact areas to try to solve any of those or did you have any

Speaker 1:          33:59          yes, Donald Otoc of, uh, projects in the public public area and pubic companies. Um, a lot of initiative. I think the, the goal would be to synchronize, synchronize everyone. Two guys are, and this is happening

Speaker 1:          34:18          monthly, we've sought of federations of nonprofit organization with a sort of cluster between companies, between startups. And there is also a big motivation from biggest companies due to low constraints and you two are so um, what's is called the responsibility of the companies for the wellbeing for the, for the implication. So I think it's going to do good, do good direction and I won't solve all the program by myself, but like in robotics, in robotics, some people think we will, I have autonomous humanoid robots from one, one metro from my side for example. I don't believe in it. I am, I think we will, I have a lot of senior robots, very specific specific shit and dedicated to the mission I dream for in men. We drove out like in the movies, but I think it's more efficient to have tennis specialized workers. And it's the same way. Found this problem of a visual impairment.

Speaker 3:          35:30          Can't remember where it was. I read an article a long time ago, uh, a blind person who could, we'd ride a bike, think he might be American.

Speaker 4:          35:38          Yes. You know about this. I'm curious if you know anything. Cause I remember there were some theories in the article that maybe because his parents and he said, just go ride a bike. They didn't credit doing things even though maybe it's a little bit dangerous. Their attitude was, well all kids do things that are a little bit dangerous and maybe this was part of his ability to do all these things. Do you, have you found anything about that, that maybe doing more things somehow affects,

Speaker 1:          36:03          I think I'm not the most qualified to, to know what seems to, to teach a kid, especially a blind one. But, um, there is no general generic change are always different cases. And I'm a friend, I've been friends with a blind person and he's blind fro from his childhood and he's able to, to do the echolocation. So you, you clicked your aunts or you make some with your mouth and you can, uh, estimate the distances, the, the area, when we go into a room, it takes an insane telling me, okay, there is no one here. It's about a 20 meters square. It's very strong. And is also um, a flight period plane that he said, uh, I think we can do more to, to help kids to, to use their own abilities differently.

Speaker 4:          37:08          Parents, yes,

Speaker 1:          37:15          but he tried to challenging and especially again because they are not so many and that's a good and bad news because uh, you can't mass projects something it really, Cruz also could cost a lot but there is a real need that that's that's the opposite side.

Speaker 4:          37:45          Yes. That's something that you can do.

Speaker 1:          37:48          We've just scratched the surface. But do you go, this is nuts to especially do face recognition because you have the voice and the person doesn't need to have explicitly the name of the person she's talking about is talking about but some situations are a bit awkward. For example, you are in a a cafe coffee machine with other people and one by one they leave and you, you know, alone annual continued talking alone and it's quiet quite a common situation in companies. It's a bit shaming for the person and we can fix it. Exactly. I don't see fine person, but we can only say, okay, there were three people then through and then no one and I can still hear the voice of my users. So I will input a teeny vibration to okay, check the reason why in front of you.

Speaker 3:          38:57          Yes. Yes, exactly. With your,

Speaker 1:          39:15          from my weekend sprints. Okay. Yes. The remapping of the brain is something that could occur very strongly only for the kids if, sure. Child blind injured child when you are adults. Um, there isn't, it's not that strong. It's more something anecdotic but in fact, indeed for the kids it's very important. And I have, uh, I know a software developer who is blind and deaf. You have the both and Isabel to read two lines of a book at the same time and understand the same amount because he is a bit listen to you because the, the is blind for, for the birth. And so he's about to do, Brian is remapping. But on the other side there is a lot of damages on the appropriate section and what we call a sensors calibration. For example, if you have, um, speakers all around you and I can, I will move a sound or injection and we'll ask you to raise your hand when the sound is moving.
