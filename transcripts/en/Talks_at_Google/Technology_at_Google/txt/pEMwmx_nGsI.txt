I work on our influencer in creator marketing, which basically means I have to watch a ton of videos every day and get to know what's going viral, who our biggest stars from 1 million to 10 million subscribers and just have a lot of fun with it. I call it more of an obsession then a profession and it's something that I never imagined at your age that I'd be doing and I just thought I'd start off before we get to this amazing panel that we have here. Just to give a little bit more context because I think tonight is all about dress code. It's all about fashion and tech, but it's also all about paying it forward, right?

Speaker 3:          01:23          And I think if you ask anybody on this panel were, we'll get into it. If you ask myself, if you ask anybody behind you, tonight's all about giving what we got when we were in your shoes and nobody got to this place alone. And I want to ask you guys in high school, how many of you guys know what you want to be when you grow up? Really? Okay. Awesome. So I want to tell you two things. There's no such thing as growing up. No such thing. In fact, one of my favorite quotes is that growing up is the moment you realize there's no such thing. Tweet it, tweet it. Sweet. It's good. Um, and there's no such thing as being one thing when you grow up

Speaker 2:          02:07          charge.

Speaker 3:          02:12          And lastly, the things that the people that raised their hand, I applaud you. You guys know more than I ever did in your shoes, but I guarantee you what you want to be today will change. And all I have to say is embrace it. Your career will change a ton. You will change a ton, you'll get a lot of advice from mentors, some of which you'll meet today, others of which you'll meet in the most unexpected ways on this journey we call life. And I just encourage you to go with it. There's no wrong answers and there's a place for everyone in this world and when it comes to finding what's right for you.

Speaker 2:          02:44          Cool.

Speaker 3:          02:48          Awesome. So let's get into our panel. Let's give it up one more time for them for coming out.

Speaker 3:          02:55          We got, we got two mikes. We got to, all right. There you go. Cool. So I thought I'd things off. I'm always, one of the questions I love asking people is what are you most proud of in, in your past? And what are you most excited about in your presence? So if you want to talk a little bit about yourself, but just mention of all the amazing things you guys have done on this panel, what's something you're most proud of in your past and what's something that you're excited about moving forward in the future? Uh, we'll start with you if you want to take it or if you want to work on and we can start over there. Start all right. Right here.

Speaker 4:          03:26          Okay. So for me, I'm just going to move on to bring the mic up. So a little back story on me. So I went to school for six years. I did six years of college and graduated with a doctorate of pharmacy degree. Um, I graduated and I realized that I hated it and you know, and I also, um, you know, wanted to tap into my creative side, um, and kind of do what I was passionate about. And so we're going back to this question. I'm proud of the fact that, um, you know, I'm a pharmacist, but I'm also proud of the head, the courage enough to go after what it is that I love to do. Um, because like he said, you never grew up. And so as 17 when you're told, okay, it's time for you to pick a major in, figure out what it is that you want to do for the rest of your life, you don't always know and you go into something and you complete it and then it's like, okay, I'm stuck. But you're never stuck. So you always have to know that you have the power to, you know, do whatever it is that you put your mind to. So yes.

Speaker 2:          04:31          Okay.

Speaker 5:          04:32          I'm Chloe. Um, I think something I'm proud of myself in my past is that I always have really considered education a huge part of what I do, even though I'm now, I'm doing youtube full time all throughout high school. I've been doing youtube for seven years, so all throughout high school, like I really focused on learning, talked about it in my videos, talked about studying for the act and applying to colleges. And it's always been something I've really pushed. So I think, you know, no matter what you do, bringing education into it is very important. And then, um, just something I'm focusing on right now is building a team and learning more about the industry, learning more about what message I want to spread to everyone. So

Speaker 4:          05:11          beautiful. Yeah.

Speaker 2:          05:14          Yup. Give it up.

Speaker 6:          05:17          Hi, I'm ally. Um, I do youtube as well. I think one of the things that I'm most proud of is that I never gave up. Uh, the journey getting to where I'm at today was not easy. Uh, but I love that it wasn't easy because it made me who I am. Um, and yeah, I mean it took me about four years, uh, and it was actually longer than that, but once I started the committed myself a team of about four years, um, but it was an easy and a lot of the things that you guys are going to be passionate about it that you guys love, you guys will find out that it's not easy. So never ever give up on your dreams. Always work hard, believe in yourself. And I always say that if you put the time and effort, you guys can make anything happen. Um, and now I've, um, now I have youtube, I have three channels. I also have a couple of businesses that I've started with my husband and, um, that's my future now, so awesome. That's amazing. Yeah.

Speaker 2:          06:14          Okay.

Speaker 7:          06:16          What about you John? Yup. She gets here. Me. Um, yeah, so he's one of says here's what I want to say. This is actually pretty big for me. This is, this is probably a big moment for me. It's a milestone for me. Um, I have a crazy story in, in fashion. Um, I've been professionally in fashion for the last 18 years. I just, I just had my birthday, so a, believe it or not and me and my twin brother just turned 40. Uh, wow. Yeah. What Cameras Alex? We still a good bro. Um, so, uh, real quick, what I want to say is, uh, I'm Filipino. Um, and uh, not, not Hispanic, but in, in, in New York and Florida, apparently I'm Puerto Rican, so, but what I want to say is I'm Filipino and your parents want you to be an engineer or a nurse. And so I met someone who worked for Russell Simmons when I was 18 and he, he designed clothing and never knew that that could be a job, that I can design streetwear.

Speaker 7:          07:13          And so I was like, that's crazy. Now it's, this event is big for me because I also teach in a high school. Um, so shout to frontier and [inaudible] hi everybody in Whittier. Shout out to everybody there. But I was telling my students, um, you know, I always tell my students is like, at the point when I started to search my career, I went backwards and I said what I want to do. So of course everyone wants to be a baller, right? So I want to make money and I wanted to travel and I wanted something different. So when I met a designer, I was like, that's what I want to do. I took my folks, I sat him down, I was 18 years old and I was like, okay, don't freak out. I'm going to drop out of college and I don't worry, I'm going to be coming apparel designer.

Speaker 7:          07:56          And they thought I was crazy. My twin brother told me late here later that they were like convinced John to go back to school. So I did go to school. I learned, I learned the classes, all my graphic design programs and everything. And uh, and it, there's a reason on the panel today. I was a director of the last three companies I've been with. I've managed a multiple multimillion dollar clothing lines and uh, yeah, so it's been a great story for your man. Youtube channel helps people learn how to lunch clothing lines. So, uh, that's what I'm proud of. Amazing.

Speaker 2:          08:27          Oh, okay.

Speaker 6:          08:28          Yeah. Waiting for me. Oh my God. I can leave on Wednesdays, right. How are we getting panic attacks, heart attacks? I'm here. Okay. So my name is Brittany. I'm, my channel is fashion related. I teach people how to make their own garments. The outfit that I'm wearing right now, I have a tutorial for, so it's a skirt in a rap top. And, um, I'm just really proud of how far my youtube channel has grown, especially being as sewing.

Speaker 8:          08:56          Um, that's like one of the least search thing on youtube. But, um, what I did to really stand out on Youtube, um, I used to intern for Michael Costello and so I really started doing light trending fashion. So, um, what I realized is that was people, was it putting out like gown tutorials. So I will show people how to make your own gown or how to make a wedding dress. So the stuff that people would send me from like all over the world with like amazing. So I do have a clothing line now and I'm just really excited to see where it takes off from now. I love it.

Speaker 3:          09:40          So there's a few things in there that I want to dive deep on. First I want to say how awesome it is that they really owned that question. When somebody asks you like what you're proud of and all of that, you shouldn't shy away. I love how you guys really talk about all the hard work you've put in and, and all the great things that have come about that. John, you mentioned something really interesting. Then I think, you know when you're in high school your parents obviously have a huge influence on you as they do throughout the rest of your life and they always want the best for you. But I think it's so interesting growing up in today's world where many of the professions that will take aren't even in existence right yet. And I want to talk about each of you to each of you guys.

Speaker 3:          10:12          How did you have that initial conversation with your parents that you were going to do what your heart desired and what you're doing now and do you have any advice for people in the audience who may be thinking the same thing? Like maybe your maybe your parents. It doesn't have to be, Hey, I'm dropping out of school. It has to be more like, Hey, I don't want to be a doctor or a lawyer. I want to do something else. Like do you have advice for people in the audience that may be wanting to produce a more, more untraditional path as untraditional becomes more of the norm in today's world? Open? Anyone jump in, jump in.

Speaker 6:          10:41          I feel like obviously our parents love us. So if they see that you're truly passionate about something and maybe in the beginning they'll be very shocked and they'll want, maybe try to talk you out of it. But when they see passion and dedication, I mean I'm sure they're going to support you, but always start everything with honesty and if it's, if what they want is not what you want, speak up. Obviously it's your, it's going to be your life. It's going to be your time and you have to make sure that whatever it is that you do, you're truly passionate about because it's something that you're going to have to dedicate a lot of time into it. So,

Speaker 2:          11:16          okay.

Speaker 3:          11:16          Yeah. Beautifully said. Anybody else? Any other thoughts?

Speaker 8:          11:19          Well, for me, luckily my parents are really supportive. I just remember I barely learned how to sell like three or four years ago. But I remember when I was three years old, I made my mom, um, a pair of shoes out of newspaper and she wore those around the house. Ah, yes. But she didn't realize, she knew I love fashion, but she didn't realize how, how big it would be for me now because I'm designing for, you know, celebrities and I've been working for Miko Costello. I had to say that again. I was going to say he did design dresses, Beyonce, Lady Gaga. I could keep going. But when you're really passionate about something, um, I just feel like you'll succeed in it. And that's how I felt like with my fashion.

Speaker 3:          12:05          That's beautiful. And I think it also goes to say there's, there's 7 billion people in the world. Like small is big. Like there's people who share the same interest as you. So if you're passionate about something, then there's generally a lot of people out there. And one of the reasons I'm so proud to work at youtube is that youtube gives that access. So if you have an idea, you can just upload, connect, and who knows where that will take you later. Um, any other thoughts about the parent conversation or advice? Uh, a couple

Speaker 7:          12:31          quick points. I should say this, I did drop out of college, but I went back later while I was working full time. I went back to school online so that I could teach at a high school. Okay. I'm not just, I'm so, I'm a huge fan. My twin brother is actually an assistant principal. Wow. Yeah. So it's all ma. I'm a huge fan of education. Um, but what I want to say for what I will say to my students, um, so this is like a big glass room for me is, you know, the studies are showing that you're going to work in a couple of different industries by the time you guys go to get your careers. Okay. So that tells me a lot of things. Um, your degree is going to be about the ability to go through tough finals and to weather through it, but you also need to have flexibility in terms of a, having a skillset that you can then put to something else.

Speaker 7:          13:15          Right. And, and, um, real quick, I just want to save on that note of attacking what you want to do. Um, you brought up a good point. You're going to do it, you're going to be in the workplace more than you're going to be with your family, your wife, your husband, your kids later. So it got to be something you're passionate about. And in terms of attacking it, like what I don't see is like sometimes the hunger. So you gotta be relentless about it. Uh, like quit story when I lived in San Diego, I've found that 10 brands that I wanted to work for, and this was before Internet. Okay. There was, there was, there's the portion about coding and everything. So when I speak, I'll say we use the term computer nerd when I was in high school and then it gets, it gets just like this, it gets nothing.

Speaker 7:          13:58          Right? But before it was, we can, I can afford a computer. I mean, it was expensive. Now everybody got it on their phone. But you gotta be relentless about, about really attacking it. So I found 10 brands I researched, I went to them and I said, hey, I'm going to be a designer. I'm not one right now and I will drive from San Diego to get you a coffee. And then when they said no, I would come back and I have 10 questions. How did you get this job? What's the best thing about your job? What sucks about it? What's a tough month? What's a good one? What's a high and low? Those sort of things. So a couple pieces of advice there, but that's the kind of mind state that I have when I attack it. And so for this 18 year career, I've done a little bit of styling on music videos. I was doing, uh, you know, uh, I was a fashion editor for a little bit, but it's all been around brands, but I use the same skillset on to the next kind of venture. And you guys should kind of have that too when attacking your career.

Speaker 3:          14:52          That's amazing. Wow.

Speaker 2:          14:56          Yeah.

Speaker 3:          14:57          Any other thoughts on the parent? Yup.

Speaker 5:          14:59          Yeah, I definitely agree with that. You're saying like anything you, you guys want to do, like if you want it bad enough, you can do it. And I think that's how it was with my youtube and still is like, I literally live, breathe youtube. I'm posting videos every day, sometimes twice a day, and it's like taken over my life. But I love it so much. And I was in school, I went to Ucla, my dad is really, really big on education and has always been like, it's his main thing. But he saw how passionate I was about what I was doing and how successful I was becoming. And I think, you know, if you, if you have that drive for something and maybe it's not exactly like what your parents thank you, you're going to do it. I think I'm just going for like what your heart is saying. Yeah.

Speaker 4:          15:42          That's beautifully said. Yeah. I would say to just do your research and present them with their research and just kind of like the same reason that you want to do it and the vision that you have for just presented to them. Um, and you know, research it and show them somebody that's successful at it already. Um, and that will be a good way. And then also just always, you know, come up with a plan. So maybe it is that you do end up having to go to college. Um, and for, you know, something that maybe more career driven and now your passion, well then maybe your plan is that you'll use that career to fuel your passion or to fund your passion. So it's about like, you know, having a plan as long as you have a plane and you know exactly, you know where you want to go at the end. I think that's most important.

Speaker 3:          16:26          That's amazing. I think a lot of you guys talked about mentorship and like looping in older people and I think there's a quote that's, it's great to learn from your mistake, but it's even better to learn from somebody else's. Right. And that's what mentorship gives you. You can tweet that one out too. Um, and I, so I want to talk about, you know, a lot of people talk about hustle. Like a lot of people say go out there, go hard. Like, yeah, eat, sleep and drink your work. You guys have all done it. I think that the, the thing that would make it really specific and add a lot of color to it is if you guys could tell maybe a story of something like now some of you got millions of subscribers, you're reaching so many people every day. Let's rewind back. Like what's the story of, you know, a moment where something click, you did something, you put in the work that other people didn't. I think the more specific we get here, it will really add a lot of color to what you have to do to get here because it's more than just saying nice things is actually doing them. And you guys have all done it.

Speaker 3:          17:23          Go ahead. Yeah. Um,

Speaker 6:          17:25          so before Youtube I actually went to film, which is a fashion school. I've loved fashion since I was in high school. Um, and I see when I discovered youtube, I actually discovered it because my husband was like, oh, there's this video. I didn't even know what youtube was, but I went on youtube and then some high trickled across a beauty video. It was a haul video. And I became, I instantly became fascinated with the fact that somebody can actually share the things that they were buying. But then I always see things from a business perspective at back then, uh, the, the video that I was watching, I think it had about 20,000 views and I said, oh my Gosh, if 20,000 people saw this video of her hall video, then if 1% of these people, actually, if I had a website and 20,000 people can watch the stuff that I saw on my website and 1% would go on my website, then that's like so many people that can buy stuff for my website.

Speaker 6:          18:16          So I always saw it from a business perspective. So then I, my husband bought me a computer and I started filming my videos at home and obviously I thought it was going to be like an instant sensation, but nobody was watching my videos and I would speak, I was very frustrated. I did it for about two years and I had a thousand subscribers and I would stay up till like three, four in the morning and I would Google. How can I get more views on my videos? What hashtags should I use on my videos or what tags should I put on my videos? I would not sleep because I wanted this so bad and I had to figure out a way to do it. And despite the fact that nobody was watching my videos and people would laugh at me for still filming and uploading and editing, I was still doing it because it was something that I truly, truly loved.

Speaker 6:          18:56          Um, fast forward about three years after that, uh, my brother said, you know, they do, they make these videos in Spanish. And the first thing I did was I went into, into youtube and I typed in what's in my bag. That was one of the big popular videos back then. It was about a hundred thousand videos came up. And then I typed in [inaudible], which is the same exact thing, but in Spanish and it was about 300 videos and I speak Spanish. So then I thought to myself, this market has not been tapped into. So I started uploading videos in Spanish. I didn't give up. I didn't give up on the fact that I'm uploading, I'm applying. I was trying to figure out ways on how I can get in there. My Youtube channel now has over, it has 1.3 million subscribers. If you would have, if you guys would have told me that I was going to have a, a channel that big, um, you know, four or five years ago, I would have been like, yeah, I'm dreaming about it, but I don't think I'm actually going to ever get there because no one's watching my stuff. So, um, I don't even remember what the question was.

Speaker 1:          19:58          But if you guys the story of Hustle, yes,

Speaker 6:          20:02          I did not sleep trying to figure out how I can make this happen because I truly wanted it. And I guess more of the story is if you guys want something, even if you know, it doesn't seem like it's going to happen for you, I promise if you guys keep working at it, you eat, breathe, sleep, your passion, you guys will make so

Speaker 2:          20:19          [inaudible]

Speaker 1:          20:23          any other stories?

Speaker 6:          20:24          Well, for me, before Youtube I was working

Speaker 1:          20:27          being at Disneyland. Yeah. Yeah. The happiest place on earth. Oh, they say. Um, but no. Um, I just remember, uh, when I started working at Disneyland, I started, yeah,

Speaker 6:          20:41          my youtube channel. But I will always find myself sketching out outfits at the register and I'm just like,

Speaker 8:          20:48          you know, there'll be a time to clock out and I'll be like, all right. And then I'm scrubbing the gutters. I'm just like, why am I doing this? It's not fun. So what I did was I took my last paycheck and that's when I started my business. And so it kind of launched from there. And then I took a percentage of that their last paycheck and then I used it for my youtube to invest in, you know, better equipment material. And so from there everything seems to work out for me. But Youtube definitely takes a lot of hard work, a lot of hard work. Um, I find myself sewing at five in the morning, but it's so fun. Oh my God. Like I'm sowing and it just like, it doesn't feel like work. I mean it's fine. So basically what I'm trying to say is if you're, you have a passion about something, definitely go and do it because that's like the best thing you could do.

Speaker 3:          21:48          Absolutely. And if I get build on, I think that you touched on something very important, which is what do you guys procrastinate with? Cause that's probably what you're passionate about. Right? But you spend the free time, I will do some audience Q and a after this. Yep. So, so you, you like, there's a lot of things that yeah, like growing up, people tell you to do a lot of things, especially when you're at your age. Right? But the thing that you should probably be doing is what you're most passionate about. If you find yourself coding until the wee hours of the night, he should probably be a coder. You know, don't fight your instincts like there's a place for everyone. And just like you did, like if you have a job and like you, at some point you will have to find a way to make ends meet, find inbetween work.

Speaker 3:          22:31          But you know, if you find yourself doing that in your free time and procrastinating, then that's probably what you should be doing as a profession. And there's a way, like, we're lucky. So we are so lucky to live in this day and age where you could turn that into something that has an audience and reach people all around the world. Um, I think I also want to point out from your story, uh, uh, the, the words overnight success, that's a total oxymoron, right? That does that. There's no such a thing. It takes years to be an overnight success and that's how people perceive you. Um, so I see it [inaudible] part of my day job. You know, like a lot of people start on youtube. They're very excited, but they don't have the dedication and alive. You guys all did. It sounds like we'll open it to the audience. I want to give you guys a final word before we opened it up to questions. Is there anything that you guys want to talk about? Like things that you want to people to know about? I want to continue the conversation. If you want to give your, your Twitter handles or your Instagram or your youtube channels, anything that, uh, is, is a good way to keep in touch with you. Awesome.

Speaker 8:          23:24          Well you guys getting to follow me on Instagram. Brick eggs, bread to burdick's Brat too. I think it's on the and so on though. Yeah, it's all on there. Um, and also I heard a host workshops and classes at Youtube every once a month, so you guys can check that out on you to space website. Sorry, can

Speaker 7:          23:46          I share a little bit on the last port? Absolutely. Go ahead. Sorry. I just, I just have to say no need to apologize. Um, for me. Okay. So let me tell you all of this. I have a fraction of the number of subscribers of, of these beautiful ladies on, on the panel and, um, and but yes, but look out for the collab. They're all going to collab with John Phenom at some point. Um, hope. All right. But uh, here's what I want to say is, uh, I'm the co I was the guy where people would say, hell, my friend designs clothing. And so I get a random call from so and so and I'd be, they'd be like, Hey, I'm so and so's friend and I'm trying to start a clothing line. I'm like, okay, cool. Uh, what do you need to know? So when I started my youtube channel, I just put up 20 videos of what I would always tell people to do in terms of starting a brand.

Speaker 7:          24:31          And I was, it was funny cause I was like, no one's ever going to watch this. I get like a hundred views in like all month or something. So, but I would say go to this youtube channel. And when I stepped away from it for a while, it came back and there was like a thousand subscribers. So saw people wanted the information. And so now I'll do a lot of consulting and they'll come from my base of people looking for the information. So for me that, that's where something kind of clicked and I realized I could actually offer value. Um, uh, but yeah, so just want to share that and for me, if you just Google oh wow. I just said if you Google at Google, that is crazy. That's crazy. That's crazy. Um, you can Google and you'll find, you'll find me. And then my, my youtube channel is Ford Slash John Fino. Thanks Jack.

Speaker 4:          25:24          Any other thoughts before we open it up? Are the things you guys want to say? I think I just want to leave you guys with this last little bit. With social media, we are, you know, watching each other and oftentimes we'll start to compare ourselves to, you know, people that we see and they may inspire us and we'll say, oh, you know, like I want to do what they do. I want to be like them, but like I would never be able to do that. You have to always remember that they had a story and they had a, they were in the same position that you were at one point, but they had to make the decision and have courage enough to, to go after what they want it to do and believe in themselves. So a lot of times with social media, you have to shut it off in a sense that you have to look at yourself as an individual and know that you are fully capable of doing what they had to do.

Speaker 4:          26:09          Um, it's not gonna be easy. It wasn't easy for them. Um, they have probably many sleepless nights and you know, probably want it to give up, but you always have to be persistent and always know that you can do whatever it is that you want to do. So, and also note social media people are always only put in there. You know what they want to show you. They're not showing you the back end of it. They're not showing you the late nights when you're, you know, up at five in the morning sewing or like when you're, you know, editing your videos so you don't see that. But you see that amazing picture or that amazing video. There's always work, work that's behind it is never easy, but you can do it.

Speaker 2:          26:47          Yeah.

Speaker 3:          26:53          Any other thoughts guys? Some series wisdom he dropped, right?

Speaker 4:          26:57          Oh and follow me on Instagram. Ed. Darren, where is it? Well and Dan was the world.com is my blog, so it makes sure you take me out.

Speaker 3:          27:05          Boom. Nice. Nice. Any other thoughts before we open it up?

Speaker 5:          27:10          I'll plug my socials. Um, yeah, so my Twitter, Instagram, everything's at Chloe couture tour and then I started a clothing line last year called glow by Clegg, a tour. So I'm, that's all on [inaudible] dot com if you guys want to check that out.

Speaker 3:          27:25          Cool. Awesome. Awesome. I think we have a boxed, a pass around for questions. Two questions. Maybe we will do it. One from this side. One from that side. Yup. Do you want to stand up? Say Your name, introduce yourself?

Speaker 1:          27:39          I have Khalila I'm from Gala Girls Academic Leadership Academy. Oh, right.

Speaker 3:          27:45          Give it up for her, for asking the first question.

Speaker 2:          27:47          That's amazing. That takes courage.

Speaker 1:          27:53          And, um, I just had a question. Like what would say, like what would you say your main focus was when you were like going towards your goal?

Speaker 3:          28:03          Great question.

Speaker 5:          28:07          Think about that one.

Speaker 4:          28:09          Uh, so for me, I'm obviously, I met this Guy Alioscha who was a designer. So I would write it everywhere. I would just tell everybody I'll put out in the atmosphere that I am a designer. So I was, I was on my way to becoming a designer and I was real serious about it. I didn't breathe until I was, I became an apparel designer. Then after that it was other things, creative director and all of that sort of thing.

Speaker 6:          28:38          Uh, my main focus, uh, well when I started you to my main focus was always a business. I always knew that I wanted to have my own business. Um, so I always made sure to keep that in mind and whatever, whatever I did. So I was always figuring out a way how I can leverage what I had and actually turn it into a business. So always owning my own company was my goal.

Speaker 2:          29:00          Amazing.

Speaker 5:          29:03          I think for me, um, something that's always been my focus and always will be my focus is getting better. And that's like at first it was getting better with makeup and then getting better with my video quality and now it's just getting better as a person and learning how to convey that and spread the message to you guys.

Speaker 2:          29:20          Amazing. I think a lot of them sounds

Speaker 4:          29:25          when we started with the goal, we think of the end result and you have to use that as fuel to get you there. Cause you know there's the hard work in between. But also, you know, remember that their shining moment that you see yourself in or whatever it is that that goal is at the end. How you see yourself remember that and use that as, as Ammo to just, you know, really work hard and go after it.

Speaker 3:          29:49          Yeah, absolutely. And there's actually a lot of studies that show if you visualize yourself attaining the goal, you're much more likely to get it. So if you begin with the end in mind, you'll be ahead.

Speaker 8:          29:59          Yeah. And for me, um, when I started youtube, it was definitely also to be a better designer. Am a lot of, I was, I was actually going to school for fashion design, but I felt like I wasn't learning enough. So that's when I kind of took a break from school and just started teaching myself techniques and then that's when I Brung it to you too. And so, um, yeah, it w two is all about me teaching people from all over the world. And I know a lot of you guys are in high schools, so I know prom season we'll be coming up for you guys. So if you want to learn how to make yes right there, if you're going to learn how to make your own prom dress and the guys, I have clothes for you guys to my channel. I'm just saying

Speaker 3:          30:41          I love it. Any other thoughts before we go to the next question?

Speaker 8:          30:44          I agree a lot on the visualizing thing. I've, I've always visualized every single goal through this entire process. Like my first thing was that I really wanted to get to 100 subscribers and everyone doubted me and laughed at me and said I wasn't going to do it. But I knew in the back of my head like I just was picturing myself with the a hundred subscribers. I already went out and bought, I was going to do a giveaway. I like bought it before I even got them. So just really like putting yourself in that place and like acting like you already have it is a big key to success.

Speaker 3:          31:14          Amazing. Great Advice. Thanks. Very question. Ah, we'll do one more.

Speaker 8:          31:21          Cool.

Speaker 3:          31:21          Right here. Oh, we okay.

Speaker 8:          31:23          Go. Do you want to stand up? Introducers like give it up for it hasn't quite

Speaker 3:          31:31          wait to go. What's your name? What's your question?

Speaker 8:          31:34          My name is honey Tokyo Masha Gay. I, I'm from Alliance Bloomfield high school. And my question is what really inspires you to do this for you?

Speaker 3:          31:45          Ooh, great question.

Speaker 4:          31:48          Sometimes it's when you figure out what you don't want to do, that in spa will lead you to what it is that you do want to do. So for me, you know, graduating in, you know, becoming a pharmacist and then, you know, at work I was bored. I was, you know, I was like, mmm, this is boring. You know, it's good money but it's boring. So sometimes it's what you don't want to do when you're in that place where you know, okay, I don't want to be here. That's what you know, drives you or gives you the idea or stirs you up enough to say, okay, what is it that I do want to do?

Speaker 3:          32:25          That's amazing. All high school students, high school students should hear what you just said. That's amazing. It's so true. What do you guys think about that question? What inspires you? What's your why?

Speaker 8:          32:36          MMM, well for me, um, like I said, I always had a passion for fashion. Um, I definitely feel like if you put anything out on social media, definitely do something that you enjoy and don't do it because it's trending or is the next popular thing. But, um, I just really enjoy doing what I do is like just waking up every day sewing, making videos for youtube and seeing all the work that people send to me from all over the world. He just, I really enjoy it.

Speaker 7:          33:07          Uh, w what I want to say for you guys individually when you guys are thinking, because everybody's thinking about how does this apply to me? So it's once you guys go on your journey and it doesn't matter what age you are, you know, like I had a friend told me the other day, he's like, he's 35 and he's like, I hate my job. I don't want to do this. Help me John. So it's the same thing that I would tell like a 16 year old kid. You have to get familiar with the things that you love and don't love, just like you were saying. And then when you get on your journey, like you might go into one job and figure out, wow, I don't like this or I don't like this situation. Maybe if you pivot it and change it, um, there's another thing that that you'll love.

Speaker 7:          33:43          That's why I've tried so many different things. Like I probably have 10 versions of my resume, but it all kind of culminates with fashion and Oh, another thing that I'll always tell people is when you do find what you want to do, um, find the best mentor possible who's doing it. Okay. Like there's a reason why someone is first in their field and someone is 226th at the same industry, the same job. Right. Like I would pay money for to intern with someone who's number one or maybe they have a huge ego and I don't like that. So I go with number six. Do you see what I'm saying? Because at the end of that, I don't want to compromise, you know, I don't want to devil wears Prada situation, wouldn't me? Cause that wouldn't, that movie wouldn't end like that for me. Where's the camera for real?

Speaker 7:          34:29          It would end like that. I'm Filipino for real. So, um, what what I'm saying saying for you guys is find that best mentor. Learn everything you can from them because when they, their psychology is different. When they wake up and when she's doing her youtube, she has 3.2 million, y'all 3.2 million subs don't sleep on it. So when she wakes up in the morning, her psychology is different than someone who has way less subs in that the designer, architect, whatever it is you guys, realtor, whatever you guys want to be, there's someone who has a psychology and if you success leaves clues. So if you grab some of those clues, it will expedite your career by decades and by money. Y'all tons of money. So like, and that's not necessarily the, the, the push for it. Okay. It's about being happy with your life, right? Because studies show at about 80 90 grand. You can kind of get everything you want in your life. So you guys are young. You'll be like, I want to be rich, I want to be a baller. You know? But it's in time. You'll see, but it's about finding a mentor and then, and then getting the, getting the clues of success from them to really your career up.

Speaker 2:          35:39          Great. I think we're going to start wrapping up, unless you guys have any quick thoughts to drop in. Any quick thoughts before we wrap up?

Speaker 3:          35:47          Cool. Um, I want to say thanks so much for coming out and the ending note, I want to say this is not the end of the conversation. It's very much at the beginning. Uh, look us up on your program. Add us on social media, come up to us after this, uh, event we want to talk to you, we want to help you with while I'm paid forward, I want to give it up one more time for our, our amazing panelists.
