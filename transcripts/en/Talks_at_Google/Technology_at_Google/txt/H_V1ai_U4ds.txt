Speaker 1:          00:06          Thank you to Mike and to Google for inviting me in today to talk about my very personal journey down the rabbit hole of Emoji over the last 18 months, the sequence of events which led me to the creation of the woman's blue flat shoe and my subsequent conviction in the power of Emoji to enrich the pop cultural landscape and simultaneously be a very subtle catalyst for change. As an image emoji enthusiast, it's great fun for me to think about this vision visual lexicon which has exploded and more importantly where it's going. However, it's very much a new area for me. Had someone told me 18 months ago that I would create an Emoji that would become acquisio lab and be anointed as a feminist symbol, I genuinely would have chuckled and yet here we are. When I look at this little Emoji available and over 20 billion smart connected devices across the globe, I see my worldview reflected and represented in a small yet perfect little illustration.

Speaker 1:          01:04          That worldview is the product of my twin occupations. The first as a fiercely committed mother to four young daughters and the second as a media strategist within the arts and culture sphere. As a mother, I spent a lot of time thinking about early childhood language acquisition and screen time literacy and implicit gender bias is faced by women in all age groups. As an arts professional, I have a profound belief and deep conviction and the knowledge produced by artists and they're unparalleled ability to tap into the psych guys before many others do. So I do also see the world and experience it through a very visual lens. It isn't that paradigm and the combination of these two occupations that led me to this little Emoji that launched a thousand thoughts. Bear with me as I try to tackle a few of them. As I mentioned, I am the mother to these four formidable daughters ranging from seven years old to 10 weeks.

Speaker 1:          02:01          However, stepping back to spring 2017 I was chess beginning to reemerge from the newborn vortex as my third daughter, the blonde started inching her way towards sleeping through the night. She had joined us in November of 2016 on election night no less and was our first us born child by May, 2017 my partner and I had finally arrived at that happy equilibrium in the family dynamic where one of you following the addition of a new child is actually comfortable being left alone with all of your children and so on. This glorious weekend in May, I tore through my way through some very unglamorous but highly practical Saturday chores mostly related to those with domestic sphere. Our first stop was the local grocery store. Now keep in mind, we all live in Palo Alto where the produce is incredible and this presentation is something of a visual feast. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          02:55          My Saturday morning shopping in no way resembles alert. Sure, yes. The UX quite the opposite. It's more of a military grade blitzkrieg operation. On this particular day as I grabbed the shopping cart to where's my kids around the produce section, I instructed our two older girls who are five and three at the time to sit down near the book carousel era. Yet. Our local grocery store. Yes, there are books for children there and yes, my children sit down on the floor and read them while I try and choose our fruits and vegetables. Now normally this would be done in lightening speed, but that morning are happy. Chaos was abruptly interrupted. The book that both of my children had chosen was this one polite as a princess. I tried all be it in vain for a few seconds and my sleep deprived Hayes to turn the carousel and look for its male counterpart, polite as a prince.

Speaker 1:          03:46          Extra come as no surprise that it didn't exist. It still doesn't. So I removed the bucks from my daughter's hands, place them in the cart and made my way the checkout lane. Well simultaneously expressing my disappointment with this book using Disney's Instagram Hashtag next up we crossed the street. It's our local baby boutique where on my punch list with the desire to replace my existing baby carrier, which was now five years old and egregiously stained because sure they have the design and the materials had gone through some innovations since I originally bought mine. As I reviewed the new options and there were literally 20 boxes on the shelves, I had an alarming realization. Only one package among the 20 depicted a male figure toting his child. It was a Norwegian brand called stocky. It seemed that only Norwegian fathers carried their children frustrated by this visual reminder that women are expected to literally carry the brunt of child rearing responsibilities. I hot stepped out of the store with my three daughters and went home. As a side note, this very topic became something of a rather viral episode a few months ago, which some of you may have seen when Piers Morgan took to Twitter, Twitter, and insulted Daniel Craig, a k bond for toting his kid. Um, in a similar spirit that Wall Street Journal recently published a huge feature on male focus designed carriers displaying such masculine motifs of camouflage and neutral color ways.

Speaker 1:          05:14          It would only be later that night as I was nursing the baby, while everyone was asleep, that the stilettos appearance became the mod that broke the proverbial camel's back. I was sending a message to a friend in Europe when I type the seemingly innocuous word shoe, and it was the first time that I noticed that Emoji auto populated and this was what appeared and in it I saw the final visual reminder. This time in the view that virtual universe, that of all the unrealistic expectations bestowed upon women, how does one begin to unpack the litany of thoughts that entered my mind at 3:00 AM when I saw this symbol, this small little picture that said to me that we as women, I expect it to lock the world in high heels. I think this is a great place to start. This is a work by a hot young artists, male artists name Torbjorn. Roland was represented by David Carr, Gansky gallery in Los Angeles. In this singular image, the stiletto evokes danger, seduction, provocation with more than a soup soon with pain. It's a tool of power which women off to own.

Speaker 2:          06:26          Okay.

Speaker 1:          06:27          Yeah. This was my reality. This photograph is by Vivian Maier, who some of you may have seen the documentary and it's very much like most of her photographic, Ugh, anonymous that was showing this women who was anonymously shot without the consent of the subject in the 70s this woman in Manhattan is wearing that shoe and is literally injured and has even gone to the lengths of crafting a heel for her cast. And so I began to ask myself whether my aversions to stilettos with simply a unique byproduct of spending literally the last eight years, either pregnant, carrying a baby on my torso, pushing a stroller, or bending over, well, helping a little person learn to walk. In other words, was my mom attire in the footwear category, an isolated experience. The resounding answer after weeks of research, which was ultimately informed, my emoji proposal was no, it was not isolated. I started looking at the history of footwear and what I under very quickly was that the red high heel and all of its implications that accompany it date back at least 70 years to the days of mad men. The following is a small sampling of the vintage. As I unearth.

Speaker 1:          07:48          I particularly liked this one, which is actually an editorial from the New Yorker magazine in the 1950s can anyone guess who it is? It's Andy Warhol. Not only is it done by Warhol, but the red high heel is literally equated with success for female workers in New York City. Interestingly, I actually discovered this spread on the Whitney's Instagram stories from their current major Warhol retrospective, the first and over 30 years. Shifting my gaze from historical ads and editorials, I turned my eye to the contemporary and started examining how footwear is used to communicate to women today, and what I found was that we have made no progress in many ways. I think it's actually worsened.

Speaker 2:          08:33          Okay.

Speaker 1:          08:33          Here's an ad from the breastfeeding lobbying group in the UK in which you can save your money from formula to be a yummy or money. Here's one from Clinique. I would challenge to ask, where's the comfort in the Red Stiletto?

Speaker 2:          08:49          Okay.

Speaker 1:          08:49          In this Geico ad, women are literally encouraged to switch their insurance policy so they can famously save, redeploy said savings. To the things they love. Red Pumps. Interestingly, the male counterpart of this ad, which appears in men's magazines, is a big hunk of steak in this one. Another great export from the UK. The National Service Health Service Equates motherhood with the abandonment of a very specific version of female hood. Here we have the TSA espousing better convenience at the airport while traveling. Yet I would challenge that the most inconvenient part of removing shoes is actually shoes with laces, not the heel. Plus, I don't know many women who actually wear heels well traipsing across the airport.

Speaker 2:          09:35          Okay.

Speaker 1:          09:36          The U s postal service equates fashion with high heels and suggest that neither fashion nor the post office rest on Sundays. Zappos a category buster, which I'll return to later in the footwear space, suggest that women all love red stilettos. Barclays in urging financial literacy and acumen, again, suggest that those funds that you save should be spent on shoes.

Speaker 2:          10:04          Okay.

Speaker 1:          10:04          The newly launched magazine, which went viral earlier this month and some of you may have seen because of a sensationalist image of Rachel McAdams pumping and designer. Where has this tagline bringing back the woman stiletto? I find it ironic given the title of the magazine.

Speaker 2:          10:22          Okay.

Speaker 1:          10:22          For giving Tuesday, Bruno Maglio donated a hundred pairs of these burgundy's Suede Stilettos, their name to the gala pump. Now I would venture to say that a woman who is new to the job search and interview process should have one fewer thing to be thinking about, which is learning to walk if in six inch stilettos.

Speaker 1:          10:42          Of course, we're here at Google and one of my very first places when I went down that rabbit hole was to look at Google Arts and culture. This shoe is an item of four were intended to protect and comfort the human foot while the where is doing various activities, and I don't know about you, but nothing about this shoe made me think of comfort or walking to Google's credit within 24 hours of me instagramming it. Come on Google, you can do better. They changed it. It's now a raggedy old booth. This is a sense that was recently launched by Carolina Herrera and wait for it. It's called good girl.

Speaker 2:          11:21          Okay.

Speaker 1:          11:21          The text used to, uh, to get women to buy it says it all. It's good to be bad, provocative, intent, lethal charisma, seductive charisma, and there's no escape. It's about ruthless power. Now that we've spent some time investigating how stilettos are generally depicted and the way, the expectations that they carry with them as a visual emblem, I wanted to talk also by my observations with Emoji specifically, which have been formed through the eyes of my young children. As I mentioned at the, I was very much an Emoji novice 18 months ago. Only the casual sort of kissed sending face or the heart appeared in my text messaging. Yet this all changed when my children began attending school. And suddenly emojis seem to be literally everywhere. So let's talk about how much my children love Emoji and how omnipresent they are in their daily existence. Because in many ways, the impetus to create my flat shoe Emoji was one, driven by parental responsibility and duty. If my kids were going to be using Emoji and seeing them repeatedly in their routines, shouldn't I at least try to create some semblance of balance to the three existing high heeled options that existed?

Speaker 2:          12:36          Yeah,

Speaker 1:          12:37          there was a peril.

Speaker 2:          12:40          Okay.

Speaker 1:          12:40          You can make bracelets with Emoji, you can wear your Emoji to school, you can keep your inner most thoughts and an Emoji diary and if you don't feel like describing your emotions, you can use the Emoji stickers.

Speaker 2:          12:54          Okay.

Speaker 1:          12:54          You can get national geographic to help you decode the Emoji language. Literally at this point I had accepted that my children were using Emoji, not necessarily as a language but as an expressive play thing. So I turned to the other world that I know and love and occupy the arts and I started thinking about how artists were engaging with the subject matter and it became very clear that they too were questioning the broader sentiment. That emoji were simple little play things, throwaways, a trend to be dismissed and outgrown

Speaker 1:          13:29          the original Emoji set here, which I'm sure many of you know, it seems like a really good place to start released. Exactly 20 years ago in 1999 and including 176 Emoji. It's acquisition by Moma. Last year it was certainly viewed as a legitimizing watershed moment. Moments collection in New York is filled with examples of design innovations that radically altered our world, so for Emoji, including the little red pixelated stiletto next to the scissors and the hamburger to be come. Part of that collection was historically significant. Now that institutional backing was in place. I was really curious about how artists themselves, we're dealing with Emoji today.

Speaker 2:          14:11          Yeah.

Speaker 1:          14:12          I first came across this image last August via Mary Boone Galleries Instagram page. It depicts the fist and the painting nail Emoji and my curiosity, as you can imagine, was immediately piqued. The work is by Derek Adams, a young African American multidisciplinary artist based in Brooklyn who might have been following for some time when I contacted the gallery a few weeks ago. For the purpose of this presentation and to learn more about this painting, it emerged. That is actually part of a whole new body of work which will be shown in March entitled new icons through multiple layers of CNC applied paint and also by hand. Derek has purposely mimicked the digital world and he's created this new series of portraits using only the Emoji library as a point of reference to an individual that because of his or her radical nature, Adam's feels is important to American popular culture. This specific work is of a woman named sister Souljah with some of you might know is an author activist and was known for the sister Souljah and move moment during the Bill Clinton presidential campaign. So here we have a highly engaged artist exploring the force of popular culture and the media on the perception and construction of self image using Emoji as a vehicle and a whole new form of portraiture.

Speaker 2:          15:31          Okay,

Speaker 1:          15:31          next up I looked to Laura Owens, the brilliant female artist in La who is known for her large scale paintings that intertwine art historical references with painterly techniques. I was fascinated by this installation from 2015 in a club called the dirty rag soccer club club in Chicago, which is an exhibition space and the former Polish soccer bar and it Owen's installed hundreds of these emoji ceramic sculptures above the fully functional bar office at her paintings there were literate, she made by hand 426 Emoji sculptures and they're 383 of them which are available if anybody wants to buy when I'm taking it one step further. Actually last November in 2017 to coincide with her major retrospective at the Whitney Museum, they went up to it and they clever. They converted each of these Emoji into

Speaker 1:          16:26          a free digital sticker pack, which I love and use incessantly. And another example of a contemporary artist incorporating Emoji. I turned to Trevor Paglen, the Macarthur Genius Prize winner and previous artist in resident at Stanford's cantor art center. Haglin is widely known for an artistic practice which seeks to expose and investigate areas that don't wish to be examined. Surveillance, military operations, intelligence. He played a crucial whirl and with Laura Poitras and citizen four and his body of work is currently on show at the Smithsonian and a major mid career survey exhibition. This specific work known as the symbology series, looks at the totemic visual language inherent in military culture.

Speaker 2:          17:09          Okay.

Speaker 1:          17:10          A typical uniform will sport patches identifying its where its job program, affiliation, achievements and place. Within that hierarchy, these markers of identity and program heraldry begin to create a very peculiar symbolic regime when they, they picked ones affiliation with that, with what the defense industry insiders called the black world, the world of classified programs, projects and places whose outlines and even existence our deeply held secrets.

Speaker 2:          17:38          Okay.

Speaker 1:          17:39          And finally I turned to the legendary John Baldessari, who at 87 years old remains as forward thinking, has ever known for using found imagery that he recomposes by carefully selecting pictures, pairing them with text, and often overlaying them with large dots and swaths of color to mask or bring attention to the areas of detail. For this series of paintings. He focused on the Animal Emoji specifically taking this interest in issues of context and cultural specificity. Further, the new emoji series evaluated the ubiquitous, seemingly innocuous images that we use in everyday conversations and then this past November Baldisari they a new emoji series. Some of the text is ironic and suggestive while some seem completely random, thus challenging the viewer to make sense out of the pairings. Well, emojis are indeed straightforward images that take the place of their real life words Baldessari his work seemed to suggest that their meanings are not actually set and I'd rather subject to interpretation. These universal images that transcend cultural, social, and linguistic boundaries are easily subverted when removed from their iPhone context and paired within different text.

Speaker 2:          18:52          Okay.

Speaker 1:          18:53          Even the hyper bright white background of the works seems to recall the lighting of the phone background where these are typically seen. Thus making the artwork itself represents something beyond its material nature. If you're curious, the peaches sold out.

Speaker 2:          19:09          Yeah.

Speaker 1:          19:11          More recently, a couple of weeks ago, the Prado Museum in Madrid released its own bespoke Emoji via Twitter to celebrate its 200 anniversary. So if you hashtag add the product 200 you immediately got this wonderful light button. Segwaying now from the art world context and into the unexpected applications of Emoji. Here you have an example of actual text being translated into Emoji, which made me think we'll Google translate offer that service.

Speaker 2:          19:40          Okay.

Speaker 1:          19:40          The traditional Emoji naitivity when which went around and was widely circulated during the holidays.

Speaker 2:          19:47          Okay.

Speaker 1:          19:48          A portmanteau of Emoji to describe that sensation. Many of us are currently feeling back at work.

Speaker 2:          19:56          Okay.

Speaker 1:          19:57          This is one of my favorites. Shopping by Emoji again, Zappos. So if you go into the Zappos App, you can actually shot by Emoji, but unfortunately, if you're a woman who's looking for a flat shoe, it's not readily visible. However, the next few screens do show what you get. When you put in, say the Mermaid Emoji and the lips Emoji. I did contact Zappos, they assure me it's in there now. So if you put in my little flat shoe, you get pages and pages of ballet flats. This is a page from the December issue of Elle magazine. Again, shopping for your loved ones based on their emoji usage. I found this on Instagram.

Speaker 2:          20:38          Okay.

Speaker 1:          20:38          This one also went viral, which is quite fun and entertaining, looking at emoji usage on a national country level. And they began to make me think, hmm, our emoji usage actually sort of the national psyche. And what does that mean for profiling? There's a good aspect of emoji targeting like this endangered species campaign. And for those of you that don't know, you can actually buy emoji usage data from Twitter and then use it for your marketing campaigns. So while this is a fantastic illustration of that tool, another option is you're sitting watching the Superbowl and you're tweeting at your friend that you're about to order pizza and you get a discount code from Domino's. And then the next week you get a discount code for Jenny Craig for a weight loss program. Another unexpected byproduct. My, my Emoji journey was learning that at the University of Michigan, within the art history department, there exist a class for undergraduates called Emoji worlds. It's taught by Jim [inaudible] who has a phd in art history and a specialty in Asian art contemporary, but also has a JD from Yale law school. And this class, um, spends about 12 weeks looking at every aspect of Emoji for their final assignment. They were each required to submit an Emoji proposal and guaranteed the Ne plus by the way, if it got adopted.

Speaker 2:          22:00          Sure.

Speaker 1:          22:02          And with this image, I want to finish on the significance of design thinking. Everything about this crosswalk makes me smile.

Speaker 2:          22:11          It's insane.

Speaker 1:          22:13          And yet the design and interpretation of my emoji across some platforms was absolutely disheartening as though the intent of the Emoji at its very core had been completely overlooked. I'll let you guess which ones. When John Baldessari was asked about his new emoji series, he wants responded. That Emoji to him represented the most Democrat Democratic living language. It is crowdsourced after all and that every time you use one, you are in essence casting a vote. With that thought. I wanted to point out the design difference in the newly adopted brick Emoji and leave you to thinking about what vote you are casting.

Speaker 2:          22:58          Thank you.

Speaker 3:          23:05          Thank you for coming to Google. Uh, and uh, telling your story that it's fascinating to me every time I hear it. So I mean, I really, really appreciate it. Thank you. Um, I wasn't going to ask you which implementation, I mean you've been all over with this Emoji campaign now that you see it in real life. Um, which implementation are you the happiest with? I won't ask you which one you don't like flipping it. That was pretty obvious.

Speaker 1:          23:33          I think the apple Emoji was the truest to the initial design. I said my dad, it was Prussian blue, which was a very concerned choice, um, to sort of flip on its head. The whole idea of blue is for boys, pink is for girls. Um, and I also, one of the sort of unexpected surprises that I loved actually about the Apple Emoji is that where all the other shoes are actually displayed at a 45 degree tilt, apple went further and truly made it flat and horizontal, which wasn't something I had considered and yet it really accentuates the flatness of it. Um, I also loved that within the Apple Emoji architecture and order, the flat sheet actually precedes the Stiletto. So when you scroll through the apparel category, the flat shoe is the very first one and that made me smile a lot.

Speaker 3:          24:26          That's great. Can you tell us a little bit, you told me about how you actually went about designing the flat shoe emerging in the first place. Um, you, you spoke to an artist friend and then you had some very specific requirements of how you want it drawn and why you wanted it to pick it a certain way. I thought it was really interesting.

Speaker 1:          24:43          So I reached out to a graphic designer named Afi masseur who had been the illustrator for the woman with a headscarf, otherwise known as the Hijab Emoji. And coincidentally is also a children's book illustrator. And I thought she would perfectly get what I was trying to get at. Um, and my directors were really quite open. Um, I absolutely wanted to not to be pink. So I said you can choose the colors, but it needs to be gender neutral. Um, I wanted both options to be available in terms of a flat with a bow and one without. Um, some people have asked me, why did you include the bow? It's such an overtly feminine thing. And the reality is in my research of flat shoes, all of the original flats had that binding to keep the shoe on. And so it was actually a reference to the historical design, a flat shoes, which of course are also women by men. Um, and so I really wanted the ultimate designers to have the option of both a flat with a bow and one without, and there were six color ways, um, and I wanted the heel to be as non existent as possible while still translating on a micro scale.

Speaker 3:          25:50          Hmm. So you submitted several versions of this to the Unicode?

Speaker 1:          25:55          Yeah. So I submitted two silhouettes, one with the bow and one without, and each silhouette was available in six colors, which ranged from dark blue, dark green, nude, Brown, black.

Speaker 3:          26:06          Hmm. So it's fascinating is that you approached the whole Emoji proposal from the art world perspective, um, because you're not in tech like, like everybody here and you, you taught yourself how to propose to Unicode and you wrote the whole proposal yourself, right? What was that like? Like where did you start when you said I wanted to get this Emoji accepted and adopted? Did you even know there was a Unicorn Organization that you had to apply to and how did you, how did you start that whole journey?

Speaker 1:          26:36          It was a really fun, um, I get goosebumps thinking about it because I had an excuse to get back on of that student learning curve and nerd out really. Um, and it all kind of happened when no one was looking in the middle of the night because until that red stiletto auto populated, I had no idea how Emoji were made. I literally held my phone and I was like, hmm, it's apple. So smart that this device has some sort of mythic, a I that knows what my shopping habits have been for the last 12 months has aggregated that and therefore this device knows this, this FEMA, there's a female holding this phone and has predicted that this is the stiletto, that this is the shoe emoji that's going to resonate with me. That was literally my justification rationale and then I thank you Google went down the rabbit hole of how I literally typed in, how do emoji get made and that's when I let it on the most horrific unicode consortium.

Speaker 1:          27:34          What page and sort of navigated my way through the lake. How does one submit a proposal on? That's when my light bulb moment went off, which was, oh wait a second, Emoji or crowdsourced anyone from me and Palo Alto to an 85 year old man in India to 15 year old girl in Berlin can submit a proposal. They just need to fill out this template. And then once I realized that I'm actually from a friend of mine who's in the audience, I reached out to the dumpling emoji creator, Jennifer eight, Lee and cold emailed her from her website and said, this is my idea. This is my observation. Am I crazy? And with a matter of hours, she came back to me and very succinctly said, this is a good idea. The deadline is July 1st. And so at this point it was June. Um, and I, how can I sell it?

Speaker 1:          28:25          Okay, I've actually vocalize this to someone. I now have my marching orders, no pun intended. And I spent basically the next three weeks putting together the proposal entirely on my own. Um, and it was really fun. Um, the, the one thing that you know, I still think about is if you go on the unicode website, they make a point of saying no emoji proposal should be for a cause, quote unquote. Um, it will be dismissed. There are some Emoji that get adopted. However, it's in spite of the cost, not because of it. And so one of the sort of lenses that I was seeing my proposal through was really trying to downplay the cause factor, which in fact when you look at that Blue Shoe and you know me, you know, it's a blatant Leah cause driven Emoji. Um, and so I had to make it as um, as empirical and statistically significant as possible. And so I downplayed the actual narrative and made it about usage, adoption and creating a really compelling argument for it to be made.

Speaker 3:          29:27          Fascinating. Fascinating. So you're kind of all in now. I just said you nerded out and you love this process. Some of us have to do it for work, but you love this process. Um, and uh, you're not just stopping with the Flat Soled Shoe Emoji and you're actually, I've heard you've actually got some other projects in the work. Um, and not just for men or for women, but men as well.

Speaker 1:          29:54          I do. This past spring I coauthored a proposal for a one piece bathing suit because the only swimmer option right now is an itsy bitsy yellow polka dot bikini even for men, even for men. And, which is why the proposal actually included a one piece swimsuit, a swim trunk for men and a swim brief for men. It's now been short, less dead.

Speaker 3:          30:19          Oh, right. So, so when do you hear about that?

Speaker 1:          30:22          I believe that committee will vote in October. Um, and if all goes well and I'll roll out next year in 2020.

Speaker 3:          30:31          Well, if that happens, we'd love to have you back here. So I don't know if you know this, but the Emoji sets like once the unicode decides the Emoji, um, how they're actually depicted, uh, is up to each of the companies. But as, as, as you pointed out, um, but there's a process that we have at Google and that you could actually get involved in if you wanted to help do the Google version fastly and thank you for getting swim trunks out there because every time I texted him, like, you know, bring your trunks, I don't have an Emoji. That's great. Um, I want you to get into some of the other topics. Um, you said that you see Emoji as, as more than just, uh, just as art. It's become, it's come language. And you touched on it a little bit, but, uh, we've had longer conversations, conversations about how you see emoji becoming part of linguistics. I was wondering if you'd comment on that because that was really fascinating because none of your kids are going up.

Speaker 1:          31:34          Um, well I'm not a an academic, but there is a term known as applicationary text. Um, and so sort of thinking back to when the original Emoji set were introduced Emoji, but really meant to be that aspect which got lots in electronic messaging of the nonverbal, so emotional, facial, nonverbal, accused intonation, and you were able to supplement sort of just the purely textural with the nonverbal cues through an image. Um, and I find that really interesting because now when we look at Emoji usage, they don't necessarily replace where it's, but they certainly add the meaning and the practical meaning of a sentence. Um, and so some would say it's part of the linguistic channel of communication is these nonverbal cues that you can now include. Um, pictorially. And so to me it's, it's one of those really interesting things. And that also, I mean, there's a reason that cliche a picture's worth a thousand words exists.

Speaker 1:          32:34          Um, and I, I've been thinking a lot about sort of how certain Emoji can be a time capsule and then let themselves, I mean, one of the things that I didn't cover it all is while my emoji escapades were happening, a lot of other greater cultural things are happening. You know, I had my realization moment and May, 2017 and basically three months later in August, Melania Trump tiptoed on her stilettos to Hurricane Harvey, which set the whole media for roar. And then a month later you're the Harvey Weinstein. Me Too. Thing happened. Um, which again, changed, change the dialogue forever, I'd like to think. And then in January of 2018 you got times up happening during the Oscars. So that was a year ago. And then in May you had the Cannes film festival where literally Kirsten Stewart and the whole bunch of a actresses were removing their shoes to walk the red carpet.

Speaker 1:          33:29          Uh, and so I'd like to think that, you know, 30 years from now and my kids are still seeing that little stiletto emote, that little flat shoe Emoji that they can sort of pinpoint exactly what was happening on a broader cultural level. Um, in the same group of the Emoji that mine was released in is the mosquito Emoji, which to someone who doesn't know the context of that proposal, they might think, why do I need a mosquito Emoji? But then when you drill down, you realize that it was proposed by a team from the Johns Hopkins found infectology team and the bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. And you suddenly realize that that mosquito is there for the purpose of mass instant global communication. And thinking about how, how do you communicate across countries where maybe populations aren't literate but completely understand this image of the mosquito thing, the vehicle by which diseases transmitted. Um, again, I think, you know, in a way this brick Emoji and the brick wall will immediately point to a specific moment in history, um, and debate. And so, um, it's interesting to me that these little images can actually point to historically significant moments. If you know the backstory to them.

Speaker 3:          34:41          One last question then we'll open it up to everybody here in online. But from that perspective of history, there is a lot of criticism that the Emoji library has gotten too large a and even on our team and android messages, we're thinking of new ways to let people search and browse Emoji because it's, it's, you know, it's gone from the original 400 over 2,700 and there's talk about, you know, should some Emoji be retired or replaced? Um, from the perspective of history, like what are your thoughts on that? Should Emoji be retired or,

Speaker 1:          35:14          it's a tricky one because I can see the unwieldiness argument, but I also am not one to use that argument, um, to justify retiring some whenever they're sort of quantity argument comes into play. I pointed to the fact that they're like 13 phases of the moon Emoji. Do we need 13 of them? Probably not. But then it becomes a point of view, decision making matrix. Um, and so I, I would hate to think that the, the minority voice or the quietest emoji would get retired because it's usage or adoption rate is lower than, you know, the twinning playboy bunnies. Um, so I think that's a bigger question for the, the engineers in the room to tackle. Um, but um, but you know, like, I think there's some statistic that by the time a kid is five years old, they've used and heard 40,000 words. So in the context of 2100 Emoji, yes, it's a bit unwieldy to scroll through and find the ones that, that are part of your daily vocabulary. But we're Carter.

Speaker 3:          36:23          That's great. I'm going to grab this mic. How did you put it out there and how did it start to go viral in the way that it ultimately did?

Speaker 1:          36:34          So I came up with the idea for the Emoji in May of 2017. I sat on it for a couple of days and then while going to an event at the pop up magazine, I'm in San Francisco, I floated at past a very close friend who said, you should do it. You've got nothing to lose. And I was like, okay. Um, and then I, because I thought, oh well, you know, apple is the one that dictates Emoji. I turned to a friend of mine who worked at apple and said, can you introduce me to someone on the design team so they can talk to them about this stiletto? Um, and she was like, well actually apple doesn't determine Emoji. The unicode consortium does. Um, and so that's when I taught myself how to do the proposal. I submitted it without really telling money. People that I did it was one of those things like college applications, you don't really want to tell people where you've applied cause you don't have to deal with like telling them that you didn't get in.

Speaker 1:          37:28          Um, and so there were a few close friends who knew that I was going through the process. Um, when I got wind that it was getting shortlisted, I decided to contact a friend of mine who happened to have written a huge piece two years prior and the Atlantic and had gone to college with me on Stilettos. And I called her up and I said, I just want you to know, and going through this process, we don't know whether it'll get accepted or not, but I thought, given that youth, you know, allocated this much ink to stilettos in the past, you might find this funny. And she immediately got back to me and was like, I want to write about this, can I, can I interview you? And I said, sure, why not? Um, so that was in August. Um, after the shortlisting. And we agree to time, the release of that article on the Atlantic to the Friday before the unicode committee would be voting on the Monday.

Speaker 1:          38:20          What I didn't expect is that between that Friday morning and the Monday that New York magazine would basically syndicate the Atlantic piece, that it would become the most read piece for the next 36 hours on all of New York magazine's website and most shared article. And that every single other outlet would call me on the Monday morning. And so by the time the committee met Monday afternoon to vote, they literally, I think probably felt like they had no choice but to face the wrath of a million women suddenly felt this desperate need to have a flat soled shoe Emoji, even though they'd never realized until that moment its omission. And that's one of the sort of feedback that I got also with the swimsuit Emoji when that sort of went out in the public domain was I was speaking to a journalist at the times in the UK and she said, you know, that the day after the chief fashion critic of the New York Times or to huge piece about this swimsuit Emoji, um, our entire editorial team got together and said, how did we miss this?

Speaker 1:          39:23          Like how did none of us realize that the Bikini is the only one? And I think that's the thing where Emoji can course correct and that you've got this incredible ability in a fairly quick timeline. I mean 18 months from start to finish to enrich this vocabulary. I mean, we're not talking about legislation which can get bogged down through 20 years of bureaucracy. We're talking about a world that, you know, it prides itself on its agility to act fast. Um, so that was how he did it. We pure PR, we bullied them into thank you media, you run a very successful, uh, yes. What are your thoughts on the inconsistencies of the depiction of the emojis admitted to Unicode on the various platforms? Obviously like apple, Google and Facebook have all have wildly different depictions of the shoe. Can you talk more about your, your thoughts and what you'd recommend if, if you know, a fragmentation is a good thing or if you'd prefer consistency in your next emoji submission.

Speaker 1:          40:29          I hate the fact that they're all different. To me it's, it's oxymoronic because Emoji are supposed to be instantly recognizable between, you know, all the platforms. I would love nothing more than to see it consistently applied. Um, that's that. I recognize that platforms have a very distinct visual and aesthetic language. And so, you know, Google has its own sort of visual language versus apple and it would, it would be ridiculous for me to expect them to somehow coordinate across platforms and agree in the consensus style format to one singular design. Um, I do think it's really funny to think about how the design aspect is rolled out. I don't know if you've noticed, say the jacket Emoji. I'm on apple platform low, eerily like a Burberry trench coat. And then you think about the fact that Angela Ahrendts was the CEO of Burberry for over a decade and is now in charge of merchandising and apple and you think, oh, okay, I get this, you know, like, and so, but yet that jacket looks totally different on apple Twitter.

Speaker 1:          41:34          And so it kind of, to me the Fi's, the very intent behind Emoji, which is I send my flat shoe to someone in Chai Por who uses a Samsung. To me those should be the same image as, um, but again, I think that's a coating and a brand problem rather than an ideal world. It would be one I wanted to ask your opinion on. Um, I've heard the argument that a emojis are actually taking us back evolutionarily speaking linguistically to hieroglyphics and um, that it's a reductionist form of language and, um, actually, you know, the a word form language is actually, um, a, allows us to communicate more, um, more freely. Um, so I just didn't know. Do you feel like, uh, there is a parallel between hierarchy hieroglyphics? Absolutely. I think Emoji or just hieroglyphs 2.0, um, in terms of pictorial language, um, I think the main difference though is obviously hieroglyphs were created before words existed in sort of the traditional as we know it sense.

Speaker 1:          42:44          Um, and I, I think in a way, um, if you look at that slide where they literally translated Moby Dick into Emoji, no one is using Emoji in that way. Um, whether I reduces, um, sort of vocabulary acquisition, that's certainly a concern of mine. And they was actually a conversation I had with the journalists from Newsweek who said, do you know of any linguists or sort of, you know, language acquisition specialist in childhood who could talk to me about sort of the downside or the effects of Emoji on young brains in zero to five because we learn 80% of what we're going to know our whole life in that age group. Um, and I said, no, you know, it's, it's such a nascent, an embryonic state, but no one has actually done the research yet. Um, you know, I think about the fact that for our generation screentime is it going to be like tobacco, the generation before we're all using it and thinking it's fine.

Speaker 1:          43:39          Then 20 years from now, all of the studies and research is going aren't going to come out and be like, how did you miss this? How did you not notice the nefarious a factor of these things on you? And so I do wonder whether children are children and 20, 30 years time are going to get the results from all those academic studies that show that Emoji, you said screentime literacy rates are plummeting of I'm optimistic and I'd like to think of that. It's a won't. But um, but I'm not an academic in that field. I think it takes a sociologist to figure that one out

Speaker 3:          44:11          after the, um, the swimsuit emojis or is there anything else top of mind or anything else you plan to work on? Is this going to become like a side career?

Speaker 1:          44:21          I know now there are couple of things that I've been searching. I've been sort of percolating in my head. One obvious one which I think would be kind of a coding nightmare is that obviously the family Emoji stop at two kids. And clearly I need more than that. Um, so I love to see an Emoji that has two parents with four kids, um, and maybe get, you know, large families lobbying for it with, um, another one, which again I think is reflective. My worldview is the play categories completely missing. You know, there's, there aren't any slides, there aren't any swings, there aren't any seesaws which are very much part of my weekend existence. Um, and certainly, um, I've been thinking a lot about the sort of natural disaster and natural catastrophe category, um, which was sort of inspired by the mosquito Emoji and that, you know, if we're going to use these little images to communicate on a broad, massive, instantaneous, um, level, can't we use it to alert people, turn earthquake alert people to our tornado, alert people to hurricane and in one little image, get people evacuating quickly rather than going through, you know, the amber alert system for example.

Speaker 1:          45:39          Um, it's, uh, it's, it's exciting. Um, but one of the things that does sort of keep me up is this idea of emoji usage eventually being mined and used to profile people. You know, like if, if you use the fist bump and it's of a dark skin tone, um, will that register you in some capacity at an agency and lump you into one box. Um, and so I think if I do another Emoji, it has to be important. Like to me, the shoe Emoji was never about, oh, I just want to shoot moti. Um, it was about everything else. Um, and I think, um, it's easy to lose sight of that intent if you don't know the backstory. But, um, I, I say that, and yet I was on the Unicode page last week and I noticed in the shortlisted list was an Emoji proposal for Fond Du, which is someone who's half Swiss.

Speaker 1:          46:38          They designed it with a little capital, which is a traditional sort of copper orange pot handle with the two sticks. And I loved it. You know, like the celebrity aspect is one of the things I think that makes Emoji so attractive and fun. And I was like, yes, I hope that makes it because I want that fallen to a Moochie. So, um, you need to balance the two. And thank you very much. You're certainly welcome back here anytime. I'd love to hear more. If there's a other Emoji that get approved, we'll certainly be tracking them as well. But thank you. Thank you.
