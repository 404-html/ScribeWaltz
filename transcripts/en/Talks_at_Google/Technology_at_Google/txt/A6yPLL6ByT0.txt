Speaker 1:          00:06          So welcome everybody. Thanks very much for joining us today. We are lucky to have two distinguished, uh, coauthors of the, uh, great recent book or coming out very shortly, machine platform and crowd crowd. Uh, let me introduce Andy Mcafee and Erik Brynjolfsson who are both distinguished professors at the Sloan school at Mit and Co directors of the Mit Initiative on the digital economy. I thought we'd start off by asking them to tee up the thesis and the main themes of their books for a few minutes. I've got a few questions to ask about both this book and their prior book, the Second Machine Age, and we'd love to open it up to all of you both in the room and, and, uh, in, uh, offices around the country. So with that, let me turn it over to you guys for a quick overview of the book. Uh, the, uh, we've known each other for some years at a variety of, of different sessions. And my favorite description of all the wonderful things that can be said about Andy and Eric. Eric is that the FDA review called them the Pinup, the pinup boys for the Davos crowd. So I'm not sure if you can outdo that, but think about what that says

Speaker 2:          01:08          about the rest of the Davos crowd. Just ponder that for a sec. Jakks waiting on, right. We would only be talking for this session now just to get your, get your expectations set properly.

Speaker 1:          01:20          So tell us a little bit about the book, what you coming off the second machine age, which is a lot about the economic transitions, the United States. What's the next chapter in that story that you wanted to tell with this book?

Speaker 2:          01:31          So coming off the last book, I think we heard a lot of people saying, okay, we get what you're saying, that the world is changing. There are these things happening with technology, um, and the economy is being effected. What now? What should we be doing to take advantage in? A little bit more about how businesses can react. And we saw a really three big rebalancing is happening. One of them was between mind and machine. One of them was between product and platform. And the third one was breeding the core and the crowd. First. We thought we'd put all those words in the title, but then our names wouldn't fit in 18 point type. So we had to reduce the number of words a little bit. So the first one is what you guys are all very familiar with, this rebalancing between mind and machine that machine's first off, helping with a lot of humans make better decisions, data driven decision making, whether it's helping the Golden State Warriors use analytics to understand that three point shots are worth more than two point shots and other things like that or where we think you need analytics for that.

Speaker 2:          02:28          Well apparently I wasn't well understood until recently. Um, and there may have been some more subtle things that they pulled out as well. Um, and of course before that it was the, their neighbors, the Oakland, uh, Oakland A's and the Boston Red Sox who won a series of three world championships between them. Um, and then, um, it's coming to more and more businesses. We've got about a three times increase in the use of data driven decision making. By the way, we've measured it across American plants and even in our own history, uh, tenure analytics, we're using analytics to try to predict who's going to get tenure at top universities, who is going to get prizes. And then it turns out that it can help predict the tenure committees in terms of who does better performance. That just the first part of that. More and more, as you guys know, artificial intelligence is making decisions on their own.

Speaker 2:          03:20          And I won't even go into all that because you guys are very familiar with that. The third, the second big rebalancing is between products and platforms. Five of the biggest companies by market cap are platform companies. Uh, Google alphabet here, Facebook, Amazon, apple, and Microsoft. But it's a, lots of smaller companies that are coming up and growing, sometimes almost out of nowhere becoming multibillion dollar companies, leveraging platforms and trying to understand that trade off between products and platforms and why those are so much more powerful now. And thirdly, between the core and the crowd. Um, tapping into the, uh, millions, actually billions of brains around the planet is something that we can do now because we have a global interconnected digital network that allows people to communicate that way in a way that they couldn't have previously and not just to access information but to contribute to it.

Speaker 2:          04:12          So this helps us understand to make sense of some of the weird things that are happening in the economy, the companies that are being destroyed, new companies being created. And there's some underlying economic principles in each of these areas of product, uh, of, of a machine platform and crowd and laying out the phenomena that are happening with lots of case studies. And then the economic principles. In each case, it turns out there's some Nobel prize winning economics that drive each of these changes and that can help us make sense of that. So that was the basic strategy of what we were trying to do with machine platform and crowd. And, uh, and we're hoping that we continue to have this kind of dialogue. We're looking forward to some questions and comments from all of you to see what the challenges are that you're facing, the opportunities you're facing, and see how well we can map them into the framework that we've developed. And

Speaker 3:          05:00          yeah, what he said. First of all, can't thank you for hosting us. It's a pleasure and a real privilege to come back. We've learned a lot from Google over the years. It's always a pleasure to come back and talk with you all. I want to also thank Andrew and your team@google.org uh, Google dog over and is a supporter of our inclusive innovation challenge back at MIT where we're trying to reward innovators and entrepreneurs who are improving economic prospects for average income and below average income workers. A lot of us in this room know that the narrative these days is that technology's killing jobs and it's not too far from that narrative to therefore technologies and bad thing. We think that's a really harmful road to go down. So we're trying to, with the IIC, we're trying to celebrate organizations that are using technology to bring economic opportunity.

Speaker 3:          05:45          We're really happy to have google.org on board with us for that. And then finally, thank you all for showing up today. I know you probably have a lot of things to do. It's a pleasure to have you here. I want to tell the origin story of this book, uh, because Eric and I wrote the second machine age together and you know, we kind of thought we were maybe thought we were done writing books about this period of crazy tech progress that we were in. And we noticed as soon as we finished that book that people who run companies kept on approaching us in the hallways, honestly, of places like Davos. And they kept on saying, essentially, I believe your story. Now what do I do? And in some cases I got the impression that there was actually some desperation behind the question that they were asking.

Speaker 3:          06:28          The people were successful, they were running large, successful organizations. And I started to get the impression that they were at sea. They were really floundering or foundering, uh, about, about what this technology surge that they, that they understood at some level the, they didn't have a great way to think about what this was going to do to their business, to their organization or their industry. And that became kind of this recurring conversation that we had. And I found it profoundly interesting because I didn't understand at first why they were so lost. These were smart, successful, experienced, well educated executives and they felt really just just deer in headlights with what was coming at them. And then as Eric and I did the work, I realized that I should have been less surprised by that because the mantra about technology that I'm repeating to myself these days is that tech progress rewrites the business playbook.

Speaker 3:          07:18          And we're in one of those stages right now where the two of us believe the playbook for how you run a successful business is being substantially rewritten by the kinds of new technologies that we're seeing. The last time I think this happened was just about a century ago when manufacturing went from being steam powered to being electric powered. And there was a naive way to think about that, which was take out the big steam engine in the basement of the factory. We replaced it with a big electric motor in the basement of the factory. And a lot of companies did that. That was kind of a no brainer. Um, people who, what we learned from business history is that the companies and leaders and business leaders who grew up in the era of Steve, it's not that they are unwilling to invest in electricity. It's not that they thought electricity sucked.

Speaker 3:          08:02          It's that honestly they could not, their minds did not admit the possibility of an overhead crane or a conveyor belt or an assembly line. These things did not make sense. If you had a factory powered by belts and shafts and pulleys and steam in the basement. This was just crazy talk. And you can go back and read the literature from those early decades of the 20th century. And there are these vicious debates about should we put a motor on every machine in the factory? Like that was nutty for decades, even though it's completely obvious in retrospect. So the homework that Eric and I had for ourselves, um, wants to think of these days. What are the equivalents of overhead cranes and assembly lines and conveyor belts that forward thinking companies are on top of. And that ones who are trapped in previous mindsets and previous ways of thinking are just not going to see. And that led to our three part answer. We, I see a lot of companies underestimating the power of

Speaker 1:          08:55          machines. A lot of companies underestimating the power of platforms and a lot of companies not doing a great job of tapping into the crowd out there.

Speaker 4:          09:03          Yeah.

Speaker 1:          09:04          So if a company like ours, we feel very much in the middle of a lot of these phenomena. They, you start your blog with example of Alphago with deep mind, the platform. Obviously we have a number of different things that a platform like characteristics, android and a lot of others. And even on crowd, you can argue that Google search is the greatest man machine collaboration in history as people will use our systems and and improve the systems through their, their clicks. Right. So what would be your advice for Google? What do you think we're getting wrong? What do you think we should be doing differently? And I see we're just about out of time. Thank you all for coming.

Speaker 2:          09:37          You do it. A lot of things right. And so I think that it, one of the risks is that in a way you may become too successful. And I think one of the things that we don't talk that much about in the book, but I think we're going to see is that as we get more of a winner take, most economy and very successful companies are able to use these technologies to dominate market after market. Cause they understand those three platforms and other companies are just beginning to get them. Then there can be a backlash. And I'm in a push back against that. And one of the questions is, you know, um, what kind of economy are we in going forward? Is it one where there's a monopoly capitalism or is it, what is, we've talked about in the book, got more of a shipper Tyrian creative destruction where there's always the risk of a, of one platform being displaced by another.

Speaker 2:          10:24          But understanding this, uh, the economics are a little bit different in a world where there are very strong network effects or even two sided network effects. And there were some big scale economies and very rapid technological change and that's something that I know that you very much on top of him, he was understanding and those kinds of dynamics. And uh, and relatedly, something we touched on the last book, is this winner take all or where did it take most dynamic? It doesn't just apply to companies, they can apply to individuals as well. So we're seeing growing inequality on a lot of different dimensions in it. It's great as Andy mentioned that google.org is helping to, um, identify business models that can create more broadly shared prosperity as mother counterweight against a world where all of the other, uh, wealth and perhaps political power gets more concentrated.

Speaker 1:          11:14          I can't, I think this is a great question. I want to answer not specifically about Google. What about companies full of smart people and at the risk of flattering people in this room and watching us. Okay. There are a lot of smart people working at Google. The single biggest failure mode that I've observed related to the content of the book when it, when I talk to audiences are very smart people, is that smart people tend to have an exaggerated version of a failure mode that everybody has, which is to be too fond and too confident and too reliant on their own intuition, judgment, experience, intelligence, and they are there. They're very often guilty of some of these cognitive

Speaker 3:          11:53          biases that Eric mentioned, Nobel prizes that Danny Conoman got a Nobel prize for figuring out the failure mode among really smart people is to trust themselves too much and one of the points we make, the broad point we make in the first section of the book is look, your intuition is awesome. It is demonstrably buggy and failure written and it's got all kinds of really powerful, pretty bad news failure modes. The fact that your Iq is well above the average does not insulate you from that and in some ways it can make that worse. Overconfidence bias tends to be worse among really smart people to the point we make in the first section of the book is to hammer that point home and make people feel bad about themselves. But then to say, look, we have these awesome colleagues now called machines that have very different failure modes than people do.

Speaker 3:          12:41          They're not inconsistent. They're not overconfident, but they're really stupid about the world. There's a wonderful concept from linguistics. It's called the intuition of the native speaker. Um, I can recognize a faulty, I'm grammatically fall to English sentence just in the blink of an eye immediately. And people who don't speak English as a first language can't do that. The reason I bring that up, we have native speaker intuition about the world, or even with all the work you guys are doing, our machines don't have that yet. So one of the broad points we try to make is let's bring together the strengths of p of minds and machines. We, if we do that correctly, I think we can cancel out each other's failure modes. The big homework, especially for smart people is to become more aware of the failure modes of humanity and more willing to question yourself. Second guessed yourself, use data, use machines to buttress the fee, the mistakes that are wet ware has.

Speaker 2:          13:35          And there are lessons from the other two sections of the book as well. I mean, you guys know joy's law that no matter what company you work for, most of the smart people in the world don't work for your company. And it's probably even true for Google. That may be the edge case. And um, so it, it's great that we were just last night with Anthony Goldbloom co founder of Kaggle and it's great to see Google tapping into the power of the crowd and all of those smart PFLs or they're not contributing and the AI initiatives that are allowing people to contribute in different ways and use a tensorflow and other things to, to uh, tap into that crowd knowledge and on platforms. I mean, yes, Google has not just one, but multiple great platforms, but as we described in the book, those are constantly evolving. As the technology changes.

Speaker 2:          14:22          There's always a risk of them being displaced. And of course there's new ones rising up as you go from a, as a Syndra pick, I said a mobile first to an AI first world, that kind of transition, you know, Microsoft kind of bottle that going from desktops to uh, to mobile. And there's these constant risk. So, um, because of the rapid change that that we were just talking about, you can't sit back and feel like, okay, we've got the problem solved. We just had to, we can just relax. I think the lessons, all three sections of the book, um, apply to Google.

Speaker 1:          14:53          Let's talk a little bit about timescale. We get very excited about this. We feel it. It's the ocean we swim in. And yet, and to your example about electrification, I, it took 50 years to disseminate the effects of electrification through society and Broadway. If you look at something like the cell phone was conceived of in 1947 demoed in 1973 sold in 83 and it really wasn't until the turn of century or later until it became widely adopted. So are we overestimating how quickly all this is coming along or do you think this is right around the corner? I think especially the geekier set is overestimating how quickly things are going to happen, how quickly the cars are going to drive themselves and we talked to AI in our homes and everything happens in the drones deliver stuff. I think we are overestimating that. However, I do think that a lot of people are underestimating that and there and the communities that Eric and I tried to be part of this is an extreme.

Speaker 1:          15:46          There's a super active debate about how soon as x going to happen and a lot of people rely on those historical examples that you just brought up and say, look, this is a decades long process. My favorite counter to that is how old was Facebook? 2000 fourish Facebook has 1.9 billion users around the world, like close to a third of humanity has adopted this technology in the space of 15 years. We have never ever seen this before. So in a world that is interconnected with pretty powerful devices and where the cloud is available on demand more, almost everywhere and we're really powerful tools are being put up into the cloud. The timescales can be quicker than we're used to

Speaker 2:          16:28          and I would make a distinction between those two examples you gave. I think Andy's exactly right that the technology, I think it's evolving a lot faster than than the cell phone did, but what does it seem to be moving a lot faster is our ability to adapt the business process change and that's what held back electricity, electricity was the technology was there for a good several decades before the factory's reinvented their business processes and reinvented their organizations and there are some technologies that can be adopted. You know, without a whole lot of business processes change like a consumer facing product like Facebook, but a lot of the ones that really have big societal changes are going to require a lot more adjustment in self driving cars. It's going to be not just a matter of having them navigate the vehicles. There's a whole set of laws, ethics customers

Speaker 1:          17:20          keep you up at night thinking about barriers,

Speaker 2:          17:23          all that ad at Moore's law, types of speed.

Speaker 1:          17:27          One of the big reasons we really like geological time, they go backwards. Hopefully that we can, we can move it

Speaker 2:          17:34          the dial a little bit in that I think if people understand how to take advantage of these technologies, they understand the process change necessary, we can make it happen a little bit faster. Um, once we give them a bit of a playbook about what works and what does more,

Speaker 3:          17:48          and it's true that the progress is really going to be piecemeal, so nationwide, fully autonomous cars that that might be a bit off. We were talking to every node Coachella yesterday and he brought up that one company that he's aware of is trying to just think about automating driving trucks between what was a Dallas, Phoenix and Dallas and La. He said, let's just do that. There's $1 billion of commerce has, that's $1 billion market. Just driving trucks back and forth between those two cities. Can we get regulatory approval for the states on the route and can we w w that's one route. We know how to map that pretty easily so that can happen pretty quickly and part of it was not do all the little side street onto the highway and then tech some person to show up and drive it. It's going to take a while to completely rewire and put sensors all over the electric grid and get the efficiencies that we, that we're hoping for with that. At the same time, the thought experiment that I run is how much work would it be for some kind of industrial facility to slap sensors on everything, give it to tensor flow and maybe get the kind of um, 15 ish percent step change improvement that the Google data centers saw when they turned over operations to a cousin of the Alphago Technology. So they're are going to be, they're going to be relatively quick, big wins happening all over the economy, I think.

Speaker 1:          19:08          Now let's talk a little bit about the social implications of that. Something that you covered in depth in second machine age but continues to be very relevant when you're talking about driverless cars immediately. There's concern about employment transition and displacement. Uh, they're sort of, the standard response is more more training and perhaps either earned income tax credit or a universal basic income. Your training has been kind of a mixed success rate. They're not a lot of great case studies there. People trying to do new things, uh, online training and the like interested in your thoughts on that. And we're generally on the balance between our need for growing productivity as our workforce ages and potential impacts on social structures and implement. There's no silver bullet.

Speaker 2:          19:48          Um, and I think there are a lot of people, you know, it was wonderful. You'd be looking far enough ahead. It's going to be very hard for education to keep up. But I think where we are right now in 2017 and as far as I can come in the next five, 10 more years of training and education is probably the, at the top of my list. And I think most, most economists list, not mine. Okay. So Andy can end. It can weigh in on that, but there's different kinds of training education. So some of them give very specific tasks. You know what? What's a bashing? Throwing a couple of doing it you Udacity, you know you can learn some skills quite rapidly. Add a great deal of value. Tom Kahleel described something that Darpa did call it the education dominance program that in 90 or 120 days when people, people some very concrete skills that massively increased their value, the more lasting skills are going to be the ones around interpersonal skills, creativity, teamwork, persuasion, some of the softer skills that machines aren't very good at.

Speaker 2:          20:42          I don't think our schools are doing a very good job of teaching those are or worst yet. I think many of we're actually crushing, crushing them, crushing them, and making them less salient. So if how many of us feel like we had some of the love of learning crushed on of us by your education? Just honestly show hands, way up in the air. Please look around the room. Yeah, this is a crime. This is a crime because I think most kids actually, they love being, you know, to put a pile of blocks in front of a three year old, the first thing they'll do is stop building something or, or crayons, kit kids, humans love creating. And if we could nurture that and let that flourish, that is what machines are not very good. Uh, playing and interacting with other people. Teamwork. That's what machines aren't very good at.

Speaker 2:          21:20          So it's not just a matter of spending more and educational, but I don't think that would hurt. I think it would help, but it's a matter of more fundamentally reinventing education. There are so many tasks in our economy still that only humans can do. And that's the way it's going to be for a while. So I'm not ready to write off human skills. I think we should invest and make people ready to do all those different kinds of human tasks in healthcare, education, childcare, um, creative works. And, and that's going to be the way that we, I think we, one of the ways we create more shared prosperity. But you may disagree. I agree with everything you just said. Here's why I disagree with um, with an education reform first approach to fixing things. My thought experiment is let's say there is a pot of money available and you could do only one thing with it.

Speaker 2:          22:03          And I have three kind of prime candidates in my mind. Number one is reform education and let's say it's going to cost something didn't, what number was that? What the, the amount of money, you know, what number was that? That was number one. Not In, not in descending order. Okay. A is perform education. Option B is to figure out why entrepreneurship in America has been on a long slow, steady decline and reverse that option c is to bring our infrastructure up from a grade of d plus two, maybe a solid B. I would actually take either option B or c over option A. I'm not saying that I'm right and I'm not saying it's a no brainer, but I would, I would love to solve either of those latter two problems. First I fall back on something that Larry Summers says, um, in his inimitable fashion, whenever somebody brings up education, he said, education reform is kind of a dodge, and unless we grow the economy faster, we're not going to be doing a lot for jobs and wages.

Speaker 2:          23:00          That's a very strong way to say it. But to grow the economy faster, I would love to figure out why entrepreneurship is sucking in America and I would love to fix our infrastructure, which is just the biggest no brainer out there. But the good news is we don't have to choose just, it's one of those, I think that there is no silver bullet. As I said, it's, we should be doing all of these things simultaneously and some of them government can help with a lot of these we can do without having government involvement and maybe, you know, depending on which way the winds are blowing, it may be that we have to take more responsibility as individuals or as organizations to step out some up on some of these other dimensions. Yeah, I completely agree with that. Without a reservation this time. And one of the really encouraging things, sorry, one of the really encouraging things in education as the rise of these really alternative ways to get really powerful skills to get credentials and designal signal how good

Speaker 1:          23:46          you are at stuff. That's a case where the government has been lagging in many cases and in fact because student loans are only given two accredited institutions, in some ways the government is impeding progress in these areas. Now I don't think I'm a frothing at the mouth libertarian, but I would like to see that situation change. So let me ask one more question then open it up to questions from all of you. We don't have mics around the room, so please just shout out the question will repeat it back. So we catch that on the mic and for people remotely

Speaker 2:          24:15          a desk SAS question two is your way to get it?

Speaker 1:          24:17          Yes. So I was going to say, so Andrew has the dory available, which is running a constant number of questions and actually voting on those questions. So then you have a retinal implant. Exactly. Solid tensorflow with lumps. Questions will surface the top, but, but let me step back before we open it up to everybody. And that's about the global implications of this. I mean there've been some have argued that the growing use of robots industrialization is blocking paths to development of tradition that available for evolving countries. During that, some old glue argues that every time you employ a robot you don't employ three to five people. Uh, what, what's your take on that? How do you see this playing out globally?

Speaker 2:          24:54          Well, it's such in the global one first. Those are Andy and I, along with Michael Spence, one of our friendly Nobel prize winning colleagues wrote an article about some of the implications for globalization. And, and that was a couple of years ago in foreign affairs and we talked about this challenge that in many ways, although technology has been one of the best things that happens, it happened to have open. As you probably know, there are a lot fewer people in poverty now than there were 20 years ago. And the tr a lot of the trends are very good. If you look a little further into the future, there's some storm clouds and in particular countries that are right now, depending on manufacturing have to be that engine to lift them out of poverty are very much in the bullseye of a lot of the automation. You go visit new China and you see thousands of people working side by side doing very routine simple tasks, tasks that a lot of you guys could probably write up some code to get in about 20 minutes to do those tasks.

Speaker 2:          25:48          And you know, those workers were able to compete very effectively against American or German or Swiss workers by lower wages. But you don't want to be competing on the basis of wages against a robot. And so that means that that middleclass that's been created in a lot of developing countries is not going to have to compete with robots that can work for $4 $2 $1 an hour equivalent. And that's not a good place to be. They need to leap frog to a situation where they're doing more of that creative and interpersonal work. You know, for better or worse, there's not that many manufacturing workers in American factors anymore. I mean it's less than 10% of the workforce you go into. Most factories it's kind of lights out. So we are in some ways less going to be less effected by that kind of automation of factory work. Then those developing countries, and it may make it harder for them to make that transition. Some countries like China, they have a very sophisticated tech economy as well, so they're got a good chunk of the people on the other side of that curve. Uh, other countries like Vietnam, the Philippines, I'm going to have a harder time

Speaker 3:          26:50          metro position. The way I look at your question, there are two unmistakable big, big global trends related to the things that we're talking about. One is, is betterment has improvement in the human condition. We've had the largest declines in dire poverty that we've ever seen around the world. We've had the biggest increases in human health in recent decades that we've ever seen around the world. Do you all know if the site, our world and data, this is, this is my favorite side, cause you walk away, just happy after you go look at almost any aspect of it. So the first one is that the world almost without exception, is getting better in the areas that we care about. That's the first trend. The second one is concentration. And when it gets to this notion that we are doing more and more manufacturing and a smaller and smaller geographic footprint, a smaller and smaller employment footprint, a smaller and smaller number of companies, footprint, wealth is getting more concentrated, income is getting more concentrated.

Speaker 3:          27:40          It almost doesn't matter where you look. This trend is really pronounced. Now, I don't know if those two trends are going to continue to interact kind of happily, or if there's kind of a clash of the titans that's coming when these costs declines. Implicit in Moore's law, meet rising wages in Bangladesh and China and places like that, those two trends could run kind of headlong into each other. I don't know that's what's going to happen, but that's something to keep our eyes on. Okay. So let's open it up to the room and is ready if we're going to have questions. But first, so the question

Speaker 2:          28:13          on one hand we see increasing returns to scale and perhaps more concentration of wealth. Uh, certainly we have seen that and the other hand we see this decline in productivity and are those two not a client productivity, let me be more precise, a slower rate of political creativity, growth. It's still growing. Um, and are these possibly connected? And I think there are some people who are making that case, Joe Stiglitz and others that there's this in Grice of a rentier economy, people a red seeking. I don't see it quite yet. It's something I'd like to keep my eyes open and take a look at. I think that some of the areas where you're seeing these, uh, increasing returns to scale actually some of the more dynamic parts of the economy. So I would look elsewhere. If you look at the part where there's been less entrepreneurship, where there are fewer a young new firms, they're not in those parts of the economy where we're seeing, uh, the network effects and so forth.

Speaker 2:          29:05          So I would look to other things. There's issues around occupational licensing, there's just the aging of the workforce. And I see everyone here is pretty young but, but sadly when people get older, they don't get to be as entrepreneurial as there are old people working in America. I know that's weird for you all and most of them are not starting companies. Um, and so, so that's part of it. Um, it is, it is obviously a little bit of a mystery. The people who've studied this like John Hall to Ang and other, they're not quite sure what's going on there in terms of that, that effect in terms of the other drivers or productivity growth, why I think we see, we'd be talking about these wonders things. The other thing we have to bear in mind is most of them haven't really hit the marketplace yet. You know, Andy and I rode in a, in a self driving car the first book and, and again, you know more recently, which is a lot of fun, but they're not a whole lot of them out there on the, on the highways or most of the other amazing technologies.

Speaker 2:          29:55          We're excited, I think folks in Silicon Valley excited cause we can see what's in the pipeline. But in terms of measurable effects on Productivity Right now we are really harvesting more what happened in the 1990s in terms of technology. I mean back in 1997, the same Silicon Valley folks who are excited about ecommerce, but did it really make a dent on traditional retailing? Not until 2017 and you know, the past couple of weeks you've been reading a lot about that. So there's a pretty significant lag between when you see these wondrous technologies and when they're going to show up in the productivity statistics. And um, that I think is probably more of the explanation behind some of those two trends. You describe it.

Speaker 3:          30:35          We have a rockstar colleague back in MIT named John Van Reenan who dove into exactly the question that you're asking and he documented that in industry after industry there are the superstar firms that are appearing a small number of them. They're sucking up a lot of the revenue, lots and lots of the profits in industry after industry, not just in high tech. And he says that might explain some of the trends that you brought up. So the interesting thought experiment, is Amazon good or bad for overall retail productivity? And the initial, my initial answer is going to be awesome for it. Well, if all the other companies in retail are seeing slowly eroding revenue and they're not laying off people in droves yet, then overall productivity for that sector could actually be a slowing down, are declining because of Amazon's sucking all the energy up into one really concentrated place. So the data, we got to dive deeper in it since a fundamentally important question. And there are a couple of different promising lines of, of uh, of research and,

Speaker 2:          31:32          or to just touch on briefly that the Amazon one reminds me of is, is this a measurement issue as well? That our GDP statistics are just horrifically bad at capturing the value of free goods like

Speaker 3:          31:43          Google, basically a lot of others. You all shrink GDP. Did you realize that? Stop it when you take Britannica. I turned into Wikipedia. GDP goes down.

Speaker 2:          31:51          Wow. But welfare, it goes up and Amazon is providing a lot more product variety choice, timeliness. Um, and, and none of those shorts in the GDP statistics either. So we have a bit of a mismatch. You go back to Simon Kuznets who invented the GDP, one of the great inventions of the 20th century, uh, Paul Samuelson said, um, one of the first things he said was, please, please do not use this as a measure of welfare. It is a measure of production. It's not a measure of how well we're doing, but of course the first thing everybody started doing was assuming GDP equals welfare. And, and that's just mathematically wrong. Yeah. We should cut over to the Bhutanese model of gross national happiness. If you go too far, I mean I think one of the problems is that the nice thing about GDP is you can measure it to like nine significant digits and it's very, very satisfying to be able to each quarter and you can decompose

Speaker 1:          32:40          it for other things.

Speaker 2:          32:41          It went up to quite low. Sorry, it was 2.4% and that and you know, gross national happiness, you know, I'd be lucky if they get the first significant digit, right? Yeah.

Speaker 1:          32:49          You, you're coming about the aging population and productivity reminds me of a most astonishing statistic. I've seen perhaps this year that within three decades if taking out Africa and population growth there for the rest of the world within three decades, the average age of humans on the planet earth will be 60 years old. Wow. Wow. That is a dramatic change in the ratio of productive people in the workforce unless they useful the time and workforce changes dramatically and requires an awful lot more productivity to help adjust

Speaker 2:          33:18          and there that there may be a good thing to know. Rod Brooks and others have really emphasized this, that let's bring on the robots as fast as we can so they can help take care of us at our old age.

Speaker 4:          33:27          Yep.

Speaker 3:          33:28          So Andrew, question from the Dory.

Speaker 1:          33:32          All right, so we have a question from Miguel who's in New York and he asks, given your research and the rates of technological change, what are your thoughts on universal basic income? Reeducating everyone should be legal, but at this can take years or not happen given the emergence and multiple pilots, do you think of ubi as a potential solution?

Speaker 4:          33:48          Uh,

Speaker 3:          33:50          absolutely. People should be researching ubi. I think the experiments that are happening in Finland are really interesting. I think what y Combinator is doing is pretty interesting. By all means, let, let's do the research. Let me tell you why I'm skeptical about a universal basic income and it's extremely straight forward. A UBI in its most classic form, provides no direct incentive, no direct encouragement to work. And as Eric and I have gone on with the work, I've become a, with our work, I become a fanatic about work, about the value of the importance of something like a job, not for some kind of old fashioned Protestant work ethic reason I don't think. But because the evidence is overwhelming that when work leaves a community, bad things happen. Not good things. There's, the research is just overwhelming on this. You see marriages fall apart, you see couples not getting married, you see kids not being raised in nuclear homes.

Speaker 3:          34:41          You can think so what you see crime going up. No, that's pretty, that's pretty unambiguous. So what, um, a lot of us know that an Deaton and Ann caissons and Angus Angus Deaton and Ann Case, uh, highlight of this crazy phenomenon that we were unaware of until recently that, uh, death rates, mortality rates among white, middle aged Americans are actually increasing instead of decreasing. And the reason they're increasing is because of what they call deaths of despair, suicide, chronic liver disease, alcoholism and drug overdoses. I can't tell a happy story about that. Those vessels, the spirit really strongly concentrated in exactly the kinds of communities and demographics that are least likely to be working. So I think about that and I think what, which of those social problems will be fixed by a magical check from the government showing up every month? And my answer and that thought experiment is basically none.

Speaker 2:          35:34          And our friend Bob Putnam really helped educate us about the these issues. But, but I want to underscore the first thing. And he said, you know, we're all for experiments and let's, let's try some different things because we can sit here in our chairs and, and say, Hey, this is what we think motivates people. But the truth is there haven't been that many real tests of some of these theories. I think we'd done in different ways. Uh, Norway has been faculty six successful with the oil wealth, giving people a longer vacation. There's a lot of childcare taken care of people and maintaining a pretty high level of satisfaction. Other oil rich countries have had not been as successful in navigating that level of wealth. So I think that there's clearly some, some devil's in the details in terms of how you structure things and how you help people that can lead to very different kinds of outcomes.

Speaker 1:          36:19          The other thing to say on this point, this is a really fundamental question. Another reasons I'm not a fan of the UBI is because it might be a solution in a w n a post work world and a world where we just don't need a lot of human labor. There was nothing in the evidence that says we're heading into that world yet. We've added net jobs in America month by month four I believe, 75 months straight, and you can go graph the number of hours of labor required to generate America's economic output. It has gone up in lock step with GDP ever since the end of the great recession. So when you're looking at the trend lines, you don't see any plateauing or leveling off. You don't see the end of work. I'll become a lot more excited about a ubi when, when the amount of labor hours needed to generate economic output starts to level off. So America has high rates of labor mobility. Is that something that we should be encouraging or discouraging earning high rates, relatively speaking. Well actually, yeah. One of the concerns is it actually that number has been falling quite a bit, but go ahead. So is it a good thing to encourage people to go with a job sooner or does that risk hollowing out the communities that Andy's talking about? It's that it's better than trying to will those communities back into existence if the, if that's not going to work.

Speaker 2:          37:30          Absolutely. I think that one of the most misguided policies is trying to target lander geography rather than people. What we want to do is help the people and if we can get them to match jobs to jobs better matched to work better. Mobility is one of our best tools and America, as you said, has historically been one of the most mobile societies and it's becoming more and more stagnated, ossified, and that is exactly what we want to lean against, seen as some of our policies I think have a little backyard a bit. We have big subsidies for home ownership, which sounds like a good thing, but it can lock people in to homes. And there are a lot of other barriers in terms of land use regulation that have made it harder for people to move. And maybe there's some cultural things as well as, as communities have become more uh, uh, balkanized and stratify.

Speaker 2:          38:17          So, um, you know, if, if a, a group of people can find better work somewhere else, I say, hey, great, let's, let's find a way to make it easy for them to find that magic. And there are lots of places in America that have shortage of labor. There are other places that have surplus, um, you know, whether it's go west young man or whatever the is, it's been something that's been part of the DNA of America to be dynamic in that way. It's weird that morbility just moving around the country is again, on the decline in America. It's, I think it's really hard to see when you sit in either Cambridge, Massachusetts or silicon valley, but almost any measure of business dynamism that you would care about is heading the wrong direction in America and has been for awhile. How many of the people in this room were born in Silicon Valley?

Speaker 2:          39:01          And just kind of curious. Okay. Three, five hands. Yeah. Yeah. So, uh, so that you know, at that, and it's great that not just silicon valley, but America has been a magnet for talent and that's part of the, I wouldn't call it a secret sauce cause it's not really a secret that's, you know, attracts the best and the brightest from around the world. And one of the things that really saddens me just to be very like specific to my area is when we get these brilliant Grad students that come from other countries, China, India or wherever, and then they're finished their phd and they want to stay and the government says, no, you have to go back. We don't want you anymore. And they're like, no, no, we want to stay. And they were like, okay, go, go, go back. And like, well, okay, I guess I have a cousin working in Bangalore. I guess I'll go work with, with him or her. And uh, you know, eventually they're not even gonna want to come here anymore and we'll have to beg them. And I think that's, uh, that's bad for the war for the United States. And I think maybe bad for the world because you're not getting the optimal allocation of talent to where it can paid value. And I'll speak,

Speaker 3:          40:01          you know, for the home team for America, this Koffka esque nightmare that we've created that we put in the way of some of the world's most talented and ambitious people who want to come to this country and build their lives and careers. I, that that's what our enemies would do to us. It makes no sense to me. The majority of the people working in silicon valley who were actually born outside the United States. So we're working to prove that a question in front and then in back,

Speaker 5:          40:25          ah, got Mike's Technology improves and well, and let me back to the developing world. For a second. You mentioned how automation may be more dangerous in manufacturing reliant countries and Indiana state of course, I wanted your take on what strategies does countries should try and develop to anticipate that's, and specifically if you think services can be an interesting path for growth at an enduro when the trade of services, uh, I think of a passage of the trade in goods these days.

Speaker 3:          40:58          Yeah, it's, it's a super tough question because the path to prosperity or the path to being a middle class country was pretty clear in the 20th century. And to uh, to, to speak a little bit bluntly, you went through a sweatshop phase. He went through a phase of heavy industrialization, a decent portion of the population worked in manufacturing, uh, in factories in sweatshops. And then over time you developed a more robust economy, more diverse one, a civil institutions came along with that. They became pretty healthy countries. We saw that playbook and the 20th century, Danny Roderick is a really good economist who is documented that that playbook is looking less and less likely in the 21st century. Mainly because of, you know, we believe, um, robots and to a lesser extent the fact that we have tons of capacity in countries like America and China and Germany. So your question, which I'm really stalling on is what's the new path to prosperity? And the reason I'm stalling is it's, I don't think it's clear at all. I don't know about the template for the 24th century path to prosperity. That doesn't include either a phase of industrialization or a or a, um, uh, a resource endowment. Aye. Aye. What you say sounds right to me, it has to do with human capital and services that can be delivered over a distance. I don't know the shining example of that yet,

Speaker 2:          42:13          for better or worse, I think, I think, uh, unfortunate. I think it has to be a playbook that more and more similar to what developed countries have because we could be coming globally and interconnected, which means you have to have an educated workforce that can deliver some kind of value that's greater than, than that other people are delivering. And getting people up to speed on that. It's hard. There are some digital tools that can speed that process a bit. And so that's going to be part of it. There may be options in, in services that can help a little bit. Personal services tend to be localized so then they are somewhat insulated from, from globalization. But it's a, it's a tough, it's a tough question and one that

Speaker 3:          42:53          we should worry about. The clearest example I think is the Indian high tech sector, which is a fairly small industry in a very, very big country. So I don't know how well that scales, but my playbook for the 21st century will be kind of, you know, bathe your country in bandwidth, get cheap devices to the people, help point them the way toward these, these amazing educational resources online and entrepreneurial is we'll find that human capital and put it to work. That's easy to say and really hard to do.

Speaker 2:          43:19          Another example is a little bit like that is that burgeoning o two o sector in places like China online to offline where these technologies have allowed lots of entrepreneurs to create many, many services, uh, new kinds of products and services that wouldn't have been possible before. It's you have a uh, an explosion of small scale entrepreneurship.

Speaker 3:          43:40          All right, so we're running up on time or two questions and back but so many speed round unless you both through your questions out there and I'll let you and we'll answer it quickly.

Speaker 6:          43:46          Good. Okay. I was wondering when you said that there are a lot of jobs being created, are the autumn in manual labor or are the, the print can have jobs and what do you think the average person is going to do in 30 or 50 years or whenever every manual labor already is fully out and made it like, do you have any thoughts or ideas on that?

Speaker 3:          44:10          I'll try to do that when super quickly. The engine of job creation in America has downshifted from classic middle class jobs to lower middle class jobs. They tend to be service sector jobs. They tend to be jobs that involve doing work in the physical world. So home health aide, gardener, short order cook kinds of things. The robots can't do those jobs yet. Your question is what does, what does the world or world of work look like in 30 or 50 years of continued tech progress? I want to be clear. I have no idea.

Speaker 2:          44:40          Let me just depend, uh, to Andrew's answer. Um, there's a big chunk of growth at one end, there's been kind of polarization. There's also been some very high end jobs who's been created the middle that's been hollowed out the worst. So there's high end jobs like the ones people in this room, a lot of people who have creative technical skills can command much higher wages. There's probably no better time in human history to be somebody with those kinds of skills or talent or luck. And there's no worst time to be somebody with just routine middle Scott middle class, uh, skills that are increasingly automated.

Speaker 4:          45:13          Okay.

Speaker 3:          45:13          Okay. Uh, one last question. The very back, I promise. I'm sorry, please.

Speaker 3:          45:18          Um, I wanted to ask about like labor and capital and how this is affecting, so do you think this trend plays into that where like corporate profits are at an all time high and the weight share of the economy has been dropping and do you think that like there's this u shaped curve in labor where like low skill jobs are safe, very high school jobs are safe and middle skill jobs are kind of taking the fall or do you think it's like all of labor as a whole is going to take a fall compared to like the capital of the corporate profits? The recent trend is fairly clear and you pointed it out. It's increasing share of GDP, going to capital and a decreasing share going to labor. For a lot of the postwar decades we thought that capitalism was going to lend to lead to greater quality of have in common or financial outcomes. I don't believe that anymore. I think that the trend, like I said earlier, is toward concentration. There were things we can do about that. It's called redistribution. It's called tax and transfer. It's called wage subsidy. This is not an insolvable problem at all and I'm less bothered about that problem and some other people. Um, but, but refusing to address it is, is the cardinal mistake.

Speaker 2:          46:29          And looking to the future, we have to really be careful about just extrapolating what happened the past. A lot of what happened the past couple of decades was sort of the first wave of computerization, uh, automating routine work, repetitive work, looking forward to what artificial intelligence can do. There are a lot of other types of tasks. So I want to mention manual tasks. Um, some very creative work last night be node was talking about, uh, cardiologists, oncologists and radiologists as Josh at me and very highly paid jobs, right? So we may see different than going on. I think the only sure thing is that the pace of change is increasing and we need to have a lot more flexibility. We need to be able to sense and respond and be active in how we do that and not just sit back passively and thinking, well, I hope it works out for us because we think there's a lot of things that we can do as individuals, as organizations, as a society to help shape the path we're going towards and we do this right.

Speaker 2:          47:22          This is going to be the best thing that's ever happened to humanity. We're going to have a lot more wealth, a lot less need for work. We're going to have people, but there's absolutely no guarantee that we will hit on all of those dimensions. It's quite possible we can have a much more dystopian scenario where there's a tremendous concentration of wealth and other outcomes that we aren't as happy with, but ultimately it's not the choice of technology. It's going to be the our choices that determine that and the reason we wrote these books was to help provide a little bit of guidance on what some of our options are and then we have to apply our values and see if we want to go in that direction. This is the headline to end on, and this is awesome. Overall, human prosperity is about to increase even faster than it's been doing. We're heading into a different chapter. If we blow the distribution, the sharing of that prosperity, shame on us. Andy, Eric Machine Platform, crowd cloud crowd at your guide to the 21st century. Thank you very much,

Speaker 4:          48:16          Ken. Thanks a lot.
