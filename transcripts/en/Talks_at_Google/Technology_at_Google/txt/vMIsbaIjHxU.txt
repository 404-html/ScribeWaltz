Speaker 1:          00:06          And we are very excited to host here today at all for authors of the book. Second Shift, the inside story of the keep g m movement. So a few words about the book. First before I introduce you to the authors who are very kindly joined us today, add to take us through the book and to take your questions and answers the second half of the session. So the book details, the complexities of an automotive industry rapidly transforming due to external economic and market forces at community reliant upon a local manufacturing facility schedules to be added to a long list of plant shutdowns, a variety of factions and personalities at odds with the city of Lansing and [inaudible] committed to persuading GM to reverse course on its decision. So a really, really great topic for us to discuss today and we are delighted that the four authors of the book at can join us.

Speaker 1:          01:01          Um, so I'm going to introduce you now to each of them. Um, David. Hello David. Um, he was the mayor of Lansing. Uh, you're in Michigan from a 1994 to 2003 and you'll hear a lot more about David's role. And as we go through the presentation, a retired person, ray, a former president and CEO of [inaudible], a Michigan based architectural and an engineering firm working closely with Mary David Hollister on the keep GM campaigns for the last ingredient Michigan community and raise served as the senior strategic and marketing advisor to marry David Hollister during his time at David close, correctly pronounced yes, professor McConnell endowed chair and the chair person of the Department of Supply chain management in the Eli Broad College of business at Michigan State University. And then Thomas Cole, um, professor of Byington and endowed a chair and director of the International Business Center in the Eli Broad College of business at Michigan State University also. And then finally Terry on the end here. I'm executive producer of a company called message maker who prepared the documentary on the, on this great story. So without further ado, I'm going to hand you over to Thomas. You're going to lead us through the details of the book and then we'll be back in 30 minutes or so to take your questions and answers. Thank you.

Speaker 2:          02:35          [inaudible].

Speaker 3:          02:40          All right. We're going to do a little bit of the David clothes in particular, but also myself, we're very big into supply chain management. The Michigan State University is known for that. We're going to try to do some, uh, play with some logistical challenges at the weave together. This story if you will for you. We're going to try to do it pretty rapidly including a couple of clips, but the logistics comes in because I'm going to hand the mic back and forth to the coauthor says well on different segment topics. So hopefully that becomes engaging and hopefully we stopped talking soon enough so that you guys can engage us with questions as well. So second shift, you see the book cover, uh, there's a documentary film that Terry Terry and his team at message makers should put together as well. There's a 55 minute documentary. It's been shown on PBS.

Speaker 3:          03:25          Detroit will be shown a nationwide, we think this fall or, or soon thereafter. So there's a little bit of a branding package there to talk about this particular story. So Mayor Hollister came into office in 1994, if I remember it correctly, and this story started in 1996 and then we take it from there actually up until last month, if you will. Uh, because the GM and part of the world, this is very fascinating. Uh, so book cover to go back to that, it's just a little bit of the scenery and Lansing, we don't play it off march, but it's the senior and the landscape a little bit, uh, uh, city line in Lansing. So the story goes back to something to the tune of their 78 general motors assembly plants worldwide. Right now they're 18 as assembly plants in the United States. And an interesting, we have two of them in Lansing and we've had a car manufacturer and their, since technically 1897 with the old motor works, really started production in 1901.

Speaker 3:          04:24          But then, uh, we kind of reopened that would rate tag nigger Chans help and others in 2001, the old plant that became kind of a newer plant and newest at the time and then Delta Assembly became the second one that opening Lansing in 2006. So it's been going on forever and ever. So the keep GM campaign had lots of obviously with the mayor and others, lots of political connotations to it that did the community one GMA Lansing or it didn't matter that we lost uh, uh, those number of employees or other things. And the storyline is pretty powerful. Uh, and I don't know, we can look at a lot of different numbers, but the numbers we like looking at are there roughly 7,000 GM employees at the two plans a little bit shorter that, that the two plants in Lansing, there's a 10 to one multiplier effect, meaning that for every one General Motors employee in Lansing, there 20,000 more employees in the Tri County area around where we are that serve Lansing.

Speaker 3:          05:20          And there are another 50,000 employees and other companies. So there's 70,000 people at different companies that support the two plants in Lansing. So you've got 70,000 of them, 7,000 of GM employees, and then it goes uh, almost crazy from their GM in Lansing has 2,700 tier one suppliers and over 50,000 tier two suppliers gets a little bit technical and the terminology, but there's a lot of infrastructure that depend on this particular set up that may or Hollister was able to frankly save for Lansing. And obviously we have other communities in Michigan that we can talk about if we can talk about what it meant, not tab these plants there. So lots of numbers, lots of fun stories and hopefully we can get into it. So the mayor was elected in 1993, came into office on January 1st that's a weird date, the start mayor, but January 1st of 1994 and two years after he got this knock on the door and he'll explain that a little bit.

Speaker 3:          06:16          We're going to let them dwell on it after I sort of set up the stage for where we're going with a storyline. A, but that's his lovely wife Chris as well. And they're happy and Smiley on the little bit in order to years later, we're just going to trash our commune if basically that was the knock on the door he got done and gee, I'm not only did they say that they were going to leave, there were some good stuff there too. And we'll get into that too. But, uh, not only where they're going to leave, the mayor wasn't allowed to tell anybody publicly anywhere. That was kind of what GM walked into his office with literally. All right, so you sitting here contemplating what happens and the add, Donovan is the knock on the door. We actually talk about and put it in quotes are as well.

Speaker 3:          06:56          Uh, and that happened very early. Now Mayor Hollister has been in the legislature for 20 some years and worked in politics for a lot of, a lot of years, even after it was may or you worked in, uh, back in, uh, Governor Granholm regime, if you will in Michigan. But this is a pretty big task to take on, uh, when you have lots of different parties. 40 through the tune of 40 signed on to actually partner with the mayor. In this particular case, we have a couple of clips. This is a clip, Terry Terry's team up. Message makers were the producers of the documentary and this is the trailer that they produced as well. And it sort of captures all of the things that I said then sets us up and scoping out where we're going with this. So let's take a little bit of a look.

Speaker 4:          07:43          This is always the general motors towel. Always an Oldsmobile town, got elected in [inaudible] 93 I get a knock on my door one day from vice president. General Motors said, we got some good news and I got some bad news. We're going to be launching this 100 year birthday of my pill. But when this mine of product and we don't have any new product from Lansing, all of a sudden thousands of manufacturing jobs were at risk. Where do you start? There were people who said, you know, we're not willing to give everything to cheat in order to keep them. And they said publicly, well, if GM leaves us oil production, it's no big deal. We'll become a wine drinking community like Ann Arbor instead of a beer drinking can. Like, we've always been, well you know what, if nobody has a job, there's nobody there to buy the wine and cheese manufacturing, they say supports between seven and 10 jobs within the community. So it means everything to the city. The mayor's approach to it was, we need to take this public, not to fight with Jim, but fight for champ

Speaker 5:          08:51          right in the heart of our city. And I commit to doing everything in my power.

Speaker 6:          09:00          How do you get two new plants built when you have plants being closed around America

Speaker 3:          09:13          in this time span, they literally close dozens and dozens of plants. And the key part of the story is that when the GM at that particular time at announce the closure, they had never actually gone back on that decision. So it was a fantastic upheld battle that these guys face. So back to the team, just to define those a little bit. So Ray obviously mayor Hollister was to lead them, trying to figure out a team to keep GM. He uh, enlisted immediately, right tab your son a boy. That's an architectural thing but frankly to speak engineering with GM because they didn't want to be spoken to in marketing terms. They want it to be spoken to an engineering terms. So that was part of the strategy I guess as well. Uh, Terry Terry and his team, Tom Leitz is a picture here as well. They're the producers. Again, all of the while we called the PBS documentary, but documentary that was shown on PBS, at least in Detroit and it looks like beyond that as well.

Speaker 3:          10:08          And then the two of us are David close again on my left. Your right and myself are endowed, chaired professors at Michigan state too. I've been entrenched in the auto community and supply chain management and all of these different things for years and years and years. In fact, David got his phd from Michigan State, so really years and years and years. So we're very much entrenched and motivated to not only tell this story, but also capture the fact that general motors not only provides a manufacturing platform for cars or provider manufacturing platform for a lot of different know high tech and other things as well for our community. And it goes back to the logo. Lansing works keep Gm. And the idea was that, uh, even to this day in January this year, uh, I'll leave it nameless because we don't want to compete against other communities per se.

Speaker 3:          11:00          But, uh, this year, Lansing Economic Club had a senior VP on from GM and he came in and, and frankly set again at the GM workforce, just the best we have and the GM umbrella, you know, that 78 plans later around the world, we can start arguing on ranking that. But nevertheless, coming in to tell 500 people at the GM Lansing, a workforce just fantastically highly qualified that this play an off the Lansing works. The Lansing works. It's what the mayor struck in the late nineties, as this say in just that, and it still resonates a, okay. So we have the, before we're going to shoot it out to the three coauthor share. We have one animated, the two minute clip that presents the overview of not only the book book itself for sure, but the six dimensional sort of framework for what uh, Lansing used in a codafide version. So these guys went through it and David close and I n together with Terry Terry's team, sort of codify what the solution actually became that can be used by other communities around the world, certainly around the country. We know Rio de Janeiro for example, is looking at the, using something like this right now for complex problem they're having. And that's kind of fascinating and out of itself. The book just came out a couple of weeks ago, so let's take a take a look at the animated clip and that captures, uh, the storyline of the book.

Speaker 7:          12:23          When car making giant General Motors decided to close its plant in Lansing, Michigan. In 1996, one person, the city's newly elected mayor stood up and said, no. Initially it was the cry of a man in the wilderness. Not once in a century long history had GM reversed a decision to close a plant, but mayor David Hollister quietly went to work building the lensing works, keep GM movement and succeeded in defying all the odds. Hollister's collaborative problem solving approach. The second shift model succeeded in bringing together state and regional politicians, economic developers, private sector firms, labor unions, educators and residents of the region. The second shift model is a dynamic collaborative management model that saved a u s manufacturing city. Hollister's coalition implemented a strategic six dimensional framework to achieve the seemingly impossible identifying name, the challenge and its impact. Partnering, develop meaningful relationships, building construct your strategy as you go. Solving, engage in constant problem solving, celebrating mark successful milestones and persevering, adapt and endure. It is powerful, persuasive and well organized. The Lansing works. Keep GM movement was a victory of people over bureaucracy of a can do attitude over cynicism. It's proof positive that when the public and private sectors work together as equal partners, both sides come away. Winners one of the Great Business Sagas of modern times. Second Shift provides a proven practical designed for problem solving that anyone can apply in any business or community, large or small.

Speaker 3:          14:21          So it's very easy to go back in the, you know, 330,000 words or a 30 70 interviews or 807 pages of interview notes if you will, to come up with that six dimensional framework. If your professor clothes and myself, it's a little bit tougher if you're retired, the Sean and David Hollister in 1996 to 2001 to actually figure out how to get all these players on board and we have some historical documents and the book for example, one is a document that we're at 40 different at both senators from Michigan, lots of congressmen and on and on and on. A character's signed on to work together. There were so many different competing interests. The new Delta towns, your plans, for example, it's a competing township technically, but became a collaborator in this process and and so on. So the collaboration is pretty unique and we're hoping that other communities can learn from that at least as a starting framework for where to go with it.

Speaker 3:          15:15          And that's what they are. Again. So we've got the identify and we've got partnering, we've got buildings solving, celebrating, persevering, eh, there's eight chapters in the book, you one chapter for each of those, plus the introduction chapter that sets the context to where we are as well as a little bit of all the different political and other issues that have to be talked about it. Then figure out, frankly solved. And then the shop there, eighth comes back to managerially talk about perhaps how to implement it and where to go with it. In the process. We have quotes from senator this precedent that x, Y, and z throughout the book and everywhere weaving them together in a nice storyline, including 37 I believe, different challenges as well as the six dimensions here. Filter down to 33 different, I'm gonna call them variables right now since I'm an academic. But these guys will dwell on them here in a minute. So let's look at those a little bit in the context of second shift. And I wasn't going to do this, but, uh, we'll call a mayor Hollister right away on second shift because I think I've been talking about this. Why did they call the book Second Shift Mayor?

Speaker 8:          16:23          We are wanting to take the opportunity to, when we did the launch of the Alero, which was a part of the 100 year celebration of the phone, involves going to bill and send a signal to General Motors in Detroit that we were so confident in our workforce that it was our, our, our strongest asset that we would launch the project. Uh, on the second shift, traditionally new, uh, shifts or new products are done in the first shift where I have all the engineers and the managers and the executives and the senior UAW leadership. So the old foxes of the unions, uh, and my dad included, it, worked there 35 years. So Jim's UPC code, the, uh, uh, the, uh, manager of the plant and our Baker, the local UAW guy came to me and said, we want to send a signal. We're going to put it all on the table, we're going to sec a, launch it on the second shift and get their attention.

Speaker 8:          17:24          So that's what we did. Now we had to identify the problem because General Motors to just inform me that they're going to be having this wonderful a week long celebration. Thousands of people coming, thousands of cars. It's going to be great. And we're going to launch this alarm on Lansing. This is all good news. But the bad news is when that production is over that we have no product, the General Motors, it's not going to in the region. And uh, that that's kind of a sock in the stomach. And he also said, you can't tell anybody. So this is a private information, uh, uh, you can, uh, decide which can do. And I'm a newly elected mayor, this is not great news. I can figure out how maybe I can get out of town, uh, and run for something else or, you know, forget this, give it to the chamber to figure out. But we decided to partner with a gym sock, couldn't the UAW and uh, and uh, use that launch, uh, to, to do it. Uh, we had two, two, two, two tasks as we defined the problem. I mean this is falls under the category of identifying the problem.

Speaker 9:          18:28          I was just going to move on to identifying which is your topic. May or so we will keep the mayor going on in identifying the problem. Tell us about that.

Speaker 8:          18:36          Well we're not, he came there at General Motors was the number one company in the fortune 500 my dad worked for General Motors for 35 years. My father in law worked with the same 30 plus years. We took General Motors for granted. We thought that you've got the state government, you've got Michigan State University and you've got GM and that's the three pillars and that provided a middle class income and it's going to go on forever. Little did we realize that below the surface that allow general motors was a planning, the launch, the a, the campaign on the 100th birthday, they were retrenching and between 1990 and 2005, they actually closed 40 plants. And once they announced the closing, they never reverse themselves. So we were looking at the reality, we were being told we're going to close your plants after 2005 a these are the oldest plants.

Speaker 8:          19:28          Uh, they were 100 years old. Uh, some of the buildings I had wood floors, so it was a fire hazard. And so you had the legacy costs and, and, and, and you had a number of other, um, factors going on. We had to educate General Motors about why they needed to stay and we had to reeducate them about the value of our workforce. And we had to get our own act together. When I talked to Donovan and he talked to Donald and was the GM vice president, uh, he wanted to know who he would be working with in the region, how many different taxing units were there in the Tri County area. And it turned out that though, I didn't know at the time there were 130 taxing units and General Motors wanted to deal with just one with one. So we had to create an unified regional, uh, uh, problem solving a strategy that could reverse a decision, has never been reversed by General Motors and do that knowing that, uh, the, the economy was pretty shaky and a of foreign competition was coming in. They were losing market share and we were going to have to change all that territory. So just concluding your about the

Speaker 3:          20:48          why it was called second shift. The Alero was launched on the second shift and it was the most successful new product launch and GMS entire history. When Jim has told us that and the interview we just said, that's gotta be the title.

Speaker 3:          21:02          And uh, and the story of course, just that nobody works on the second and third shift except torics those, darn, it's a necessity to work shift I guess. But that's a fantastic story to tell them that the engineers and everybody else was home sleeping and we still trust to this community to take care of that particular, uh, launch, which became incredibly successful. Developing meaning real meaningful relationships. It's the next story and the sixth dimensional framework that we also called partnering. It's a little hard to see on the yellow one there, but developing meaningful partnerships. And I already alluded to this and we're going to invoke ray tab. You're Sean, because we had the 40, incredibly high lofty community members, uh, sign on to doing this stuff where I'm not sure all 40 of them compete against each other before they signed this document. But it seemingly could have been that way the way you, our friends tell the story. So there was a lot of competition and they came through the same table at this particular point in time, right?

Speaker 9:          21:59          The mayor's vision for this campaign was to bring people together and make it a collaborative effort. Now when you have competing townships, who would love to have the any new product line, any new plant, uh, they're all looking out for their own self interest as they should be because they're representing their constituents while the mayor was representing the region. And that's the way he wanted to come across is that this was a regional effort. So trying to get those 40 communities to get on board, plus the chamber, plus the city council, people were telling him, you're wasting your time. GM has never changed their mind about doing something like this. When they're going to close the plant, they're going to close the plant. So why are you wasting your time wasting the city's money, wasting your energy, your efforts, you can put your time into something better.

Speaker 9:          22:49          But the mayor had a vision. He wanted this to be a world class city and the anchor, one of the anchors to that would be general motors, keeping them and trying to convince them to stay. So, in doing so, he brought on all these different elements of the community, neighborhood people, uh, the Union folks, uh, just about everyone that you can think of somehow got on board. We started and launched the Blue Ribbon Committee and we had 28 people there that were a part of the committee at the time. We eventually had, uh, 50 people on that committee and, but that was too large. You couldn't make decisions. The discussions became like a free for all. And uh, so we had to create what we call the quick response team. That was a team of about six folks who met weekly to try to make decisions on what was going to be said to the public, how much going to be said to the public, where were we at in the status, what was her next challenge?

Speaker 9:          23:49          Uh, Thomas alluded that there were over 35 major challenges and I'm talking about major challenges, getting the edge legislature to change the laws to enable, uh, a tax abatements and incentives to be used to retain a plant as opposed to trying to retract new jobs. Uh, getting the chamber on board, they were convinced they were going to lead this effort that took weeks to get resolved and getting the townships on onboard. They really didn't want to do this, but they felt like they had to because they needed to keep an eye on Dave. They knew they didn't want him doing something that he shouldn't be doing. So these people all got on board and the city console, he actually had to change the console, get three new people on board because there were three negatives. Then you heard the story about we become like Ann Arbor wine drinking instead of beer drinking and bowling town.

Speaker 9:          24:44          Eh, depends on the, well Jason says otherwise, but you know, at any rate, partnering became a big part of this. And uh, so the mayor asked me if I would do this and when I, when he first asked me, because we had a successful partnership before that in building the Baseball Stadium Downtown Lansing. So when he asked me, Ray, can you do this? I said, sure, absolutely. We were going back from Toledo, so we had a two hour bus drive. And I'm thinking all the way back to last week. What did I just do? I don't have a clue as to how to do this. But then we put, I put together a strategic plan for this and created all these different partnerships and all of these subcommittees and uh, figure it out. If everybody did their job, we might have a shot. So

Speaker 3:          25:31          we're going to build plants in about five or six slides. We're going to build a couple of plants. Uh, that's a fantastic undertaking, an achievement to get 40 of those sets. I know it's impossible to see, but if you look in the book, you're going to see all of those different titles and characters that I described, if we construct your strategy as you go. So the last thing on the planet, anybody should do is construct your strategy as you go. You usually want to plan of some kind and unfollow a roadmap. But we're frankly at Google and the first place I can think of where you construct your strategy as you go. It's probably a company like this. So at least one company on the planet, they may resonate. What the mayor Hollister and rates had the son dead. Eh, that's not the norm that the General Motors would fall for example, but that's the norm that had to be followed. In this particular case. On the left hand side there of the slide, you see a bunch of those variables if you will, to under sub dimensions of these things. We're not going to go into those, but they are described and talked about in the book and how they were used to construct your strategy as you go. I'm going to invoke David close on that particular topic.

Speaker 10:         26:36          Thank you, Thomas. It was, it was not a situation where you could develop a strategy and a and then executed. It was far too dynamic than that. As you see some of the key points on on the list that Thomas said on the previous slide, there's someone, uh, you, you have a dynamic environment of a, what's the auto industry looked like? It was clear the auto industry was changing from a situation where you had the people that came out of a high school and the vocab thing to a very high tech development process. Changing workforce. Uh, it was clear in this case, we have a very big challenge in communicating, uh, to the environment you had is, is Dave Hollister talked about, uh, the challenge of, uh, the internal group that you shared information with. You have the community who wasn't quite sure of what's going on here.

Speaker 10:         27:29          Uh, you have general motors who is saying, we made a decision and we're going to move on. And then you have local people from General Motors who, who know that the quality of the Lansing workforce. And so it was, is keeping those four things, those four balls in the air throughout the process. And that, that became a lot of the challenges as we read through the, uh, um, the manuscripts and the interviews. It's like looking at those things and balancing them and, and doing the trade offs and, uh, just having a strategy in place and, and, and, and keeping that going, uh, was the key part. And that's, that's one of the key lessons. I think one other point I want wanted to make, and we're Dave Hollister and I first started working together, is if you look at, uh, many communities trying to retain manufacturing environment, which is something that I've worked on a lot, it's, there's historically a lot of uh, conflict as is ray talked about and how do I get them to realize that for a business point of view, a city's boundary or counties boundary is irrelevant. It's how do I put together a region and get the workforce to, to make it work together. And that's not, that's not just a Lansing problem, although I think this story shows that we've a cow, uh, did a lot to accomplish it, but it's other regions too, including southeast Michigan.

Speaker 11:         28:52          Okay.

Speaker 3:          28:52          The dynamic nature of problem solving is played up and, and will be called engage in constant problem solving as well. I mean, think about where you guys are right now. Self driving cars, just a totally different phenomenon from late nineties or 50 years ago or 1897 if you want to go really far back. And that's not the same mindset. Same strategy, same person, same toolkit to actually get into that arena. Even though seemingly for the average customer, it seems like it's a car, but it's a total different dynamic. And I think these guys ran into that as well. Uh, engage in problems in constant problem solving. We're going to recycle. We're going to go back to a mayor Hollister to talk about engaging constant problem solving.

Speaker 10:         29:38          Well, I was confronted with this knowledge. The gentleman was leaving,

Speaker 8:          29:42          uh, the Chamber of Commerce, uh, wanted to continue to take the lead on a retention that was one of their traditional roles. I didn't feel that was going to be adequate. Uh, and, and I had to think about any community could offer a tax break. I mean, any, all communities, all states have some kind of tax package. We wanted to go beyond that and create something very unique. So we created a single entry single exit, one stop shopping and problem solving center. So we said to the community and to General Motors, if you have any problem that you want solved, you bring it to the mayor's office. That's the one, one stop single entry. And that if the mirror is office isn't, uh, we identifying or justifying the, the data, then it's just a rumor. I mean it's Kinda become directly from the mayor's office. So you've got a single entry single exit, one stop.

Speaker 8:          30:48          And we asked General Motors to give us 30 days and any problem they wanted solved any problem and we would tackle it and we would come up with a solution. We had a problem of odor on the, uh, on the, uh, west side of town and we engaged the community to, to solve that. We got the health department involved, got neighbors, Neighborhood Association involved, the environmental groups who are out there, uh, you know, opposing us initially, uh, saying that General Motors shouldn't be getting more capacity to build in Lansing because of the air quality was not adequate. And, and so, uh, we had to figure out that strategy. Uh, we got the schools involved. Um, we put an, uh, an air monitoring, uh, m and a weather monitoring, uh, equipment at the local high school football stadium. And so they could get the every day they were getting data on air speed and temperature and humidity and all that stuff.

Speaker 8:          31:47          And I've got the schools involved in the students involved. And then we got the engineers at General Motors to start tutoring in the schools. So we had to try to be very comprehensive in our, and our strategy. Uh, General Motors a as we won the, uh, the designation of the most successful launch ever, uh, uh, uh, uh, Mark A. Hogan indicated that he would consider Lansing for the plant. We were originally told her you wouldn't have any chance at all, but because we were so successful in his problem solving that he gave us a shot at it. Uh, and so we had to, we had to, uh, deliver on that promise, but it was, uh, we brought to the table, the township officials, the city officials, the state officials, the governor and I were at odds with each other. The legislature, I was a liberal democrat. He was a conservative Republican. We fought like cats and dogs. Uh, but when we were both executives trying to save this industry, we decided to, to work together. So we put together a strategy and we, uh, delivered on it and we solved virtually every problem. And one of the key ones was rate, looked at the internet, figured out how to build a plant and the downtown Lansing site, uh, and do it without, uh, disrupting the production and without taking a greenfield and turn it into a, uh, a plant.

Speaker 9:          33:18          Actually, let's start it over to ray to tell the plant stores a little bit. Well, that plant story's kind of interesting because when Marc Hogan, the vice president for General Motors said he was considering building a plant. They were building Cadillacs in Eisenach, Germany and they wanted to stop that production, bring the Cadillacs back to the United States. They didn't say where, but they didn't say or when, but they were going to build a plant somewhere. Well to really try to figure out what they wanted to do and why they want it to do it. They had to build a business case here to that says it would be cost effective to build it wherever they're going to build it. Well fortunately for me, I was led to a set of plans that came from the plant manager at the time Jim's up, cause he pointed me to a, a set of photocopies of a plant that was built in Brazil.

Speaker 9:          34:13          It had a code name blue McCall. This was very confidential information. He told me, you can't share this with anybody. You can't tell anybody where you got it from. I said, okay, can I tell the mayor? He goes, okay, there's three of us. And so I shared it with the mayor, but it took me a week to figure out would that plant fit or not because it was in metric and it was virtually indiscernible as to what was on that. So I had to create a new scale. It was a scale of like one inch equals 167 meters. Something weird. You know, most scales are not like that. Well, I had to figure that out and figured it out that this plant was built on 70 acres. There was 180 at the existing plant site, about half of which could be torn down. And the buildings that were on there could be torn down. They were vacant, there were storage areas. So I said to Jim, if you tear those buildings down, this plant will fit there. So Mark Hogan happened to be the vice president who oversaw the project in Brazil. And so when I showed him this plan and said, we can put this footprint on that plant site, he said, where did you get that? I said, research. And so we offered to take it back to Detroit with him and he said that wasn't necessary. He would take it himself. And several months later he said, we're going to build that plant.

Speaker 3:          35:39          So we, we went through this celebrate [inaudible] thing here of intermediate steps. Obviously this is a long process. So part of the model includes celebrating as well as we go along. And then the last one is persevering. And that should go for obvious reason, but if you don't celebrate till the end, they're like, we oftentimes do when this particular process, you don't get the community behind you or these 40 different people signing on and the organizations they represented. So the celebration became an intermediate as well as a final step in the process and clearly getting a 70 acre plant where they may, I wanted a couple of hundred acres or really want to 300 acres and on and on. And we're going to talk more about acreage here on the, on the last final slide I think. So moving on to persevering and that's adapt and endure in this particular context. And I'm going to invoke a professor close again on that topic.

Speaker 10:         36:33          Again, this is the whole process is a very dynamic environment and we had to adapt as the, the educational structure change, the workforce structure changed. Uh, and even the, uh, the supply chain structure changed. We had to bring in, uh, suppliers and uh, um, get them involved in the process as we came to the step of a second plant. Uh, other issues came in in terms of integrating that. So, uh, the, the overall process, the realization I think is that, um, it's not, you just create a plant and it's going to last a long time. The plant is changing day to day. And we had to switch that reality both for both for General Motors and, and of course they realize that. But the community I don't think did, and some of the lessons that that came out of the interviews where what we have to do with the community to make it realize that. And I think a Dr. Simon had miss you made a very good quote on the back of the book where she said, we have to not take for granted what we've had here in the past and be able to adapt for it. And, and that's really one of the big lessons that came out of it

Speaker 3:          37:43          and not the gloss over celebration too much. Jason, of course, invited us here, which is kind of cool. And I think this was about two years after Jason Played Basketball for Tamia. So at Michigan State, uh, we're guessing it was mayor was about 1998 season, give or take that he dedicated to the whole team and their season was dedicated to the keep general motors in the community as a campaign, which is pretty cool. So a couple of years after that again, but he missed the dedication to General Motors Jason did, but he certainly won a national championship that may have been a better deal of the, of the two. For us it was keeping GM and winning national championships. We want all of the above two plants were built in a process. Ultimately the outcome of the storyline and stuff, there's a 2001 plan to build at the Grand River Assembly, the 70 acres dot.

Speaker 3:          38:31          Right tag or Sean was talking about where there were 180 or so acres available. That's a hundred year old. The on top of each other type plan with nice drawings from Brazil. I mean the, the storyline there is pretty deep and interesting if you dig into the book as well. And then Delta township a in 2006 that plant open. So the Delta township supervisor, a mayor, I'm not sure exactly the title there, but anyway, the leader of Delta township signed on almost immediately when mayor Hollister said, can you help out Lansing and support our costs? And sure enough, five years later, which is really short time period, they get their own gigantic plant. The Delta Township plan producers a little over 1100 cars a day. Right now the Grand River assembler produces about 700 and there were about 6,500 to be exact employees in town. Um, and I guess the UAW leadership loves to tell the story about the last year they've hired a thousand new workers and all of them actually became members of the union.

Speaker 3:          39:30          So that's a storyline that the, those guys like telling as well. And our story, if according to Mayor Hollister, uh, may not stop there, this is the second, the last slide. So that's why we want to poke on the community a little bit. So as recently as June of this year, uh, mayor Hollister, when our record and saying that, you know, in General Motors owns 1100 acres of farm land next to Delta Township, that plant, they only need anywhere from 70 to 300 acres depending on what size plant they want to build. So they can blend, build a lot more plants there. And I guess the quote on this one is CMA or gms and then the farming Bisnar business Holister sheds. So 1100 acres later, I guess there's hope in the community that that means something for the future as well. And I know you guys are getting a fantastic deal if you want to, if you go at us, a regular customer on Amazon or what have you, it's a 30 buck deal, but you guys get it to a 15 and they sell as it looks at two you may get a reimbursed as well.

Speaker 3:          40:27          So it's a pretty cheap deal in the sense of having her on your bookshelf or storyline. If I'd known Jason was on the team back then, I would have dug up a Tommy. So the signature in the process as well, but Tommy's, it's again one of the testimonials on the back page of or back cover rather have the book plus a few of the characters like senators and other show. Thank you for indulging us if we will take Q and a as you see fit from any of the five of us including territory of course was instrumental in this, a message makers team to put this into a documentary and so that's in in some way the surface level of the business model. Let's nice 55 minutes to look at and this is the more codafide version of the six dimensional framework that we're hoping other communities can learn something form at least as a starting point to solve similar problems and a complex format. Thanks everyone.

Speaker 1:          41:17          [inaudible] yeah, GM has

Speaker 8:          41:34          never before birth you swallow hard, you put on a good face. He, you begin gathering as much information as you can to formulate a strategy and then you articulate a plan and engage partners and begin the process of building trust. Because without trust, it's not going to work. And this is going to be difficult because you've got a fragmented region, three counties, and they're all competitors and there's no history of collaboration. Uh, so it was going to be important that we, we incrementally bring people along. And I made a commitment very early to the regional leaders. It must be a win win situation. And this is critical to the other communities that are facing us. You bring your competitors to the table. So we invited the township leadership to the table. We invited the chamber, the chamber in the law and the campaign, when I ran from air, it didn't even give me an interview.

Speaker 8:          42:48          I mean, they endorsed my opponent without even giving me an interview because I'd been such a Liberal Democrat for 20 years. So I had an, I invited them to participate. I asked the chairman of the chamber to be the public face of the Blue Ribbon Committee. So you're bringing the diverse people together, you do a transparent process, you commit to win, win, and then you begin problem solving. Then part of that was getting data. We went to the University of Michigan and Astra, I had George Fulton, who was, uh, a wizard and an expert in a, uh, economic forecasting. And he had a metrics of measuring a job impact by, uh, uh, uh, incentive packages and, and uh, and that, and, um, George and his team, uh, uh, were credible beyond if we had gone to Michigan state and got that data. People say, well, it's a homer kind of a deal.

Speaker 8:          43:43          You know, they're just covering themselves. But by going to George Fulton and, and his, uh, national reputation, and he documented that this plant, this hundred year old plant was generating 2% of the wealth in Michigan. 2% of our GM gross domestic product was coming on to that 100 year old plant. And that if we could replace the plan, we would have this much impact. And if we got to, we'd get this. And, and we took that data then and began to educate the community about how important it was a general motors stay. And then we developed a strategy to educate General Motors, uh, about, uh, the asset at that Labor represented and that the community, um, brought in our DNA because we are a collaborative, uh, group and, uh, and it slows us down as we knew it was going to take time. This was, this plays out over about a seven year period.

Speaker 8:          44:38          Uh, the Blue Ribbon Committee that we had actually functioned a as a formal group for five or six years. Um, but, um, to answer your question, you, you just modeled ahead. I mean, we didn't have a great detailed plan, but I had been a legislator for 20 years. Probably the best training I had for the task was teaching high school dropout. Try when I was a high school government teacher prepared me well for working in the legislature. Uh, but it also prepared me well for working in, in this kind of environment. Uh, because, uh, when I was in the legislature, I was a chairman of the welfare budget. So every year I took a beating and trying to get this budget passed and you're always putting together coalitions. You're always trying to get the budget passed and this is the most political budget. Uh, so, um, I chaired that for 16 years. He had the experience of bringing people who don't like each other together and getting the focus on a common goal. So that's what we did. It took time. Uh, but uh, it paid off in spades.

Speaker 1:          45:44          I have one more question before I will physically here rather than, um, you know, we'll go through the process of the book when can see open challenge and he came up. But here we have the living, breathing your body and then just living and doing that day in, day out. So you're wasting your time. You have a self, the challenge and the other one gets thrown up for all of you personally, you know, how did you continue to dig deep and find that passion to continue to problem solve? And that's something we, we like to think we do at Google everyday. But you have a really big worlds example of having done it an impact and so positively the lives of so many people. So it's nice to hear your personal experiences of how you dig deep and how you force yourself to do it. Right.

Speaker 9:          46:39          Okay. I think my formal training was as an engineer. I got my masters, a bachelors and Masters at Michigan State. I was a civil engineer. Civil engineers build roads, they build buildings, they get involved in all kinds of different projects. So this was totally out of character for me. I had never taken on a project like this, but the training that I had received during the course of my career and the course of my college education was problem solving. Engineers have to be problem solvers. Uh, you folks are problem solvers and that's what that's about. It's like you have to rely on all of your experience and the folks that you have around you and the ability to dig deep. It's dig deep. I learned that there was a, an equation for this. It's called five whys. Why do you do this and why do you do that?

Speaker 9:          47:32          And we'll dig down, drill down and keep drilling down and eventually you get to a solution. And that's what we did. That's why I with the Terry because I think Terry, I'm message makers all they do as being innovative and creative. So great. I mean it's sort of part of his business part I think. And give me a good story. Nope. Our task here was to help tell this story and really what I wanted to say. I said, you know, you have a few people here, but I was not involved in the team that kept GM. I lived in the community, but our task was to retell that story and Dave and ray came to me and said, you know that people are moving, passing on whatever and we got to capture it. Uh, so we interviewed what 40, 50 people they are in the documentary there in the book and you get this, get that perspective on it and not just ours but theirs as well. And it's pretty fascinating. And, and I encourage you to look at it.

Speaker 8:          48:24          Oh, it was important to me if not winning or losing. The important thing is the integrity you bring to the process and being transparent, being inclusive, uh, being focused on when, when, uh, those were important that you do, you're going to have setbacks, you're going to get, you're going to have failures. So, you know, I couldn't undaunting task, but uh, and I had joined motors telling me not to do it, not to do, do it publicly. Uh, but if you create a process that is transparent and participatory and inclusive and focused on win win, then then you can take those setbacks, uh, so that winning and losing and not the issue, the issue is the integrity of the process and the integrity you bring to the process.

Speaker 9:          49:10          We as a book author, team method, pretty much weekly for ever. It seems like to put this into code of I for one and a transparency and trust or two words that these two guys brought up every single freaking week. That had to be the mantra for the storytelling. Not Trust between us. That's fine. But transparency with the community in the late 90 nineties telling them sort of what the, what they needed to know. Perhaps not every single detail, but uh, the trust had to be built with the community and all these parties

Speaker 10:         49:45          as a by training is, is basically in supply chain and I'm a Michigan Native and spent the last 20 or 40 years of my life in Lansing. So I had a really passion for, for the whole thing. And I think what really got me interested in this is people were talking about, well Michigan is not relevant because our labor costs are too high or what other excuses we had in terms of that and the fact understanding supply chain and the fact there are a lot of trade offs. And in this particular case, one of the key trade offs as talent and labor and, and uh, getting people to understand that that is not a trance transferable thing. You can just can't pick it up and move it someplace else. One of the stories that came out of the book is a lot of the Lansing workforce, our old farm boys. And I'm not saying that negatively, I'm saying it was one point of view. These are the people that make stuff work and, and that's one of the differentiators in the plant that they keep the plant working because they, they are, they have that hands on attitude and telling that story was, was so very important to me.

Speaker 11:         50:51          Okay.

Speaker 12:         50:52          Beautiful. I'll take it back then. Okay. I have a loud voice. That's what I was saying that, so, um, you mentioned, uh, there was 40 other um, plants or we're looking to shut down. Did you find any other communities or cities catch wind of what you are doing and you were public about it? Did they come to you guys to try and mimic what you were trying to do and was anyone else successful?

Speaker 11:         51:18          Okay.

Speaker 3:          51:20          In some interesting way, obviously. And I'm speaking for the two academics a little bit because we'd been questing and part of the process is that we quest in these guys too. So every chapter has a reflections by ray Todd got shot in the reflections by the mayor so that they get to tell their story in an I personality, uh, wording, if you will. Uh, but part of it was that General Motors knew what everything that was going on, but they wanted to sign on to an absolutely nothing because in some way, uh, implicitly I think speaking on professor close on myself as behalf myself behalf, I think they were supportive but there were never going to sign onto it. So that question that you're asking if other communities, what I've gotten wind of it and General Motors had been even a little bit supportive. They want to use large loads, the same blueprint when 40 out of plants were being shut down. And not that that became a competitive thing, but they were not going to say that this is the perfect model to keep us do this in the future. And I think get mayor Hollister throughout the work, through the aspect of it as well.

Speaker 8:          52:20          [inaudible] president I macpherson of Michigan State University took this model that we had developed and he as he organized Michigan State's, uh, a strategy of attracting the facility for rare isotope beams. This was a federal initiative, was a department of Energy Program of $800 million. The competitor was a in Chicago and was in the district cove out, uh, President Obama. So we were taking on debt to win this competition, uh, an uphill battle. And, uh, he, he brought together a statewide group of influential people. He, uh, I bought two macro Tom Board. We played to our strengths, we engaged students, uh, and he was successful in bringing this rare isotope facility to Msu. That was a model that it was directly a pattern after what we did on a much larger scale. Other communities can adopt this, but we haven't seen many a most documentaries. Uh, ray and I looked at some documentaries are a, the closing and the kind of looking back what went wrong and you know, Janesville Wisconsin was one read recently was on public television.

Speaker 8:          53:37          We wanted to tell a story that celebrated the fact that we, we, we won the battle, uh, but also to document it and kind of memorialize it and, and, and more importantly to educate the millennials. Uh, what, uh, what, what's the, what's the foundation upon which our current economy is built? Lansing is now much more diverse in its economy. It has a, a vibrant it sector, 350 it firms. It's second only to Hartford, Connecticut and insurance and finance headquarters. Uh, it is, uh, a high tech companies that are spinning out of the cyclotron and the rare isotope, uh, beam, uh, effort. Uh, so we wanted these young people, uh, like you're a employee employment base to recognize that while the automobile industry represents the old economy, they also have been part of the transition to the new economy. And, and Lansing, we didn't know it at the time.

Speaker 8:          54:43          We were struggling with how to transform from the old basic manufacturing with unskilled labor to the new economy with advanced manufacturing and highly skilled labor. In fact, one of the reasons we got the, uh, the f f Rib, the facility for a rare isotope beams is the highly skilled workforce that the UAW had that could take a building that they're building and design it and then modify it as it goes through the process because it's a seven, eight year process of building the building and you've got skilled enough workers that can make the adjustments and, and, and a modified the building as the science unfolds because it's the same dynamic. Uh, so that's kind of a long answer to your question.

Speaker 9:          55:33          One of the things that when we started this process, we had no idea where we're going to go or what we're going to do solving on the, on the run, so to speak, is there was no manual out there that said, you know, go to page 27, you'll find out how to do this or that. Uh, so we had to create this as we went, but the success of what we did, now we've had communities call us and say, we'd like to kind of emulate your model. Can we do it over the phone? No, you really can't. You know. So Dave was asked to go to Janesville and I was asked to go to Janesville, but they didn't want, you know, much promise. They thought we can handle it over the phone. So they tried a little bit of the model. They didn't use the whole model and as a consequence they failed.

Speaker 9:          56:22          But they've reinvented. I mean I'm happy for them because they'd become a, a central area for medical now, uh, there between Milwaukee and Chicago. So they, uh, have attracted a significant business area there. At any rate, other communities have tried to do something similar, but most have failed. Now that we've put the model in writing and thanks to David and Thomas, we were able to do that in a way that would make sense to other communities and make sense to students as they read this. Uh, so we're grateful for the opportunity. The last thing I want to add is that this effort ended up being a $3 billion plus investment in the Lansing region since we started this process. That doesn't include all the suppliers. So there is a huge, huge amount of investment here and to saving over 70,000 jobs in the state of Michigan.

Speaker 11:         57:25          Thank you. Thank you. You're in front of you today and that will hear your story and online and congratulations on contribution. Thank you. Thank you.
