Speaker 1:          00:11          Thanks for coming. This is going to be about video games and uh, axillary content associated with the video game industry stuff that spins out, you know, everybody has an intellectual property product, right? Video game and no one expects the Spanish inquisition or that was the reference to it in 1980s phones. Anybody get that? Cause you know, I'm riffing off of 1980s video game culture a little bit. That's why I have the ready player one thing going on. So I don't, that's not a spoiler alert. Spoiler alert. I don't want to ruin ready player one of the great movie and the book. Any hope? So yes. Uh, people have, uh, intellectual properties, right? They make them a video game and no one expects all kinds of derivative works. What kinds of things are going to spin out of them? Definition of what a derivative work is is pretty fixed when it comes to things like Harry Potter, right?

Speaker 1:          00:54          If I write fan fiction on Harry Potter, that's a derivative work. I'm using all the characters, maybe spinning off the storyline, but if I do a derivative work of a video game, what does that mean? Is it if I record myself playing a video game right and may commentary and do crazy tricks or whatever is that it's a bit of work or is that transformative? Which is it? Right. So a lot of this has to do with that question. A lot of the research that I've done has to do with that question of transition between well had had is something like a platform like youtube afford that kind of playing. By what I mean by afford, I mean, uh, that's from like HCI langue language. You guys get it right. Uh, that means well are the, is going to let this happen or not? They preventative and that positive affordances or not.

Speaker 1:          01:44          And it's also a play on words. Can you afford the intellectual property liability that you might want if you want to make your platform particularly playful to let your users make your out with intellectual property products that maybe are not on, you know, could be transformative, could not be transformative but mashup culture or you know, practices. People scroll down a little bit with the intellectual property product, uh, me give you something entirely new, entirely transformative. And as a platform owner, you capitalize that as a participant in that you get to share in the profits, hopefully. So how do you design platforms that strike that balance? That's the underlying question, right? I don't know. I started doing this work in 2009. I lived a blessed existence. I get to play video games and, and call that and just have so much fun. Right? And that's my research and I get to play video games.

Speaker 1:          02:42          I get to hang out with video gamers. I get to hang out with communities that love playing games and ask them how it is they take something that they love so much and transition it into a business, a business product, or sent it out there to the world. What compels them to do that? Culture is important, right? If you're going to design something, I would say you need a cultural anthropologist, especially if you have it really committed community for the, for the product that you hope to host, let's say on your platform, right? You need to find out what, what matters to them the most. So that's what motivates me. Uh, the intellectual property question is important to me. I mean, I've written, I've written a book on it. I've been called the copyright and our, uh, yes, because I have a really limited, I'm not a big fan of the US copyright system, so if you want to read my book, you can get it for free from the MIT press because I magically negotiated a creative Commons license for it and people start trying, if you, about how I manage that. So it's available, you can download it for free. Okay. So here's what I got. Is this look familiar to anybody, right? This is twitch plays Pokemon. Uh, and

Speaker 1:          03:58          twitch isn't a particular, back when I started this project in [inaudible] in 2009, video game commentary was still in its infancy. Yeah. Uh, maybe the fo the

Speaker 1:          04:12          directors that the party that I guess directors who were, um, starting out the channels have you had a hundred a hundred subscribers a hundred times this. All right. Um, but I thought it's going to become something I, and I wondered why Youtube has really done a great job in making it possible for a platform to be just super plastic. In other words, have the ability to accommodate all kinds of different content in a modular way so that users can adaptively put their content opt in, whatever way that they can identify with. Then I, then after some time of doing that, Justin TV, I remember Justin TV, the first version of twitch. All right. So then twitch, um, was even more plastic I think. But that's not to say that youtube isn't great, it's just that, okay, this is a different set of, uh, and the reason why is it their intellectual property or their terms of service requirements for a little less stringent.

Speaker 1:          05:08          So in this case, twitch plays Pokemon in case you don't know, and I get to play a little bit of a video, um, is someone, obviously the channel owner hacked away at the interface so that check a man's would end up being play commands, right? So anybody who was watching the livestream cause instant chat, check a man's man, and you ended up playing Pokemon even though you technically should be the audience watching the live stream. Right? But not, you're a good player. So are, are you ready to be a player as an audience? That's great. I was sitting on a at Virginia Tech and a panel with the associate registrar of Copyrights, right? The, the, the second in command copyright officer in United States. And I raised this question is who do we blame? Uh, who, who's liable for it? The NCA claim digital copyright. It's funny because obviously there was some circumvention right?

Speaker 1:          06:00          Some patent, log out, whacked up a little bit, and we could not come to that conclusion. And not that, not that twitch cared, not right. Maybe Nintendo cared. Nintendo tends to care more than other companies, but not the twitch cared. And who would you hold Bible and he was so the plasticity of the platform, and I want you to guys if you can remember that word plasticity, uh, allowed for modular putting together like what you would consider disparate platforms of video game platform and interface on [inaudible]. I want a webpage, a platform and a chat commands it a lot of this modularity to come together to this novel product and it kept going. Right. All right, so as a designer I would think, I mean I used to teach for product and design innovation at Rensselaer polytechnic and modularity, the ability to have a, have enough structure to have fixed elements, but enough plasticity to have the user design.

Speaker 1:          06:59          It's his or her ultimate imagined use. That's magic. Right? That's great. And that's, I didn't have to know that the system, the screen infinity anyway, so that's how I started thinking about platforms. Generally. How do you design them in video game culture was particularly well suited to study it because they're always playing. They're always hacking away either at the game rules, right? How to cheat, how to work arounds, uh, or also how to show their content. So let me just, I'm going to place in the background. Do not be distracted. All right? If you want, it can be a script. I don't know. There's no sound. Okay. You're going to be distracted on, I'll talk to you. Anyway. So in 2009, I started following the call of duty community called Duke community. It started with my wife for two. I needed to play better because I suck.

Speaker 1:          07:51          And um, I thought, well, maybe youtube has it, how to write. And it turns out it was entertaining beyond its use of value. In other words, I could learn some things from the people that was watching. By the way, this is me. Um, I can learn things from the people I was watching, but I also found an incredibly entertaining, it was entertaining for so many reasons that the commentary that the way they were talking about the game play was great. Uh, the tips and tricks were great and maybe they weren't terrible. Yes, I know it's modern warfare. I know this is the black ops and I know there's a lot of problems with game culture generally, so I'm focusing on the, on the positive. So, um, so there was a lot of learning to be done anyway. Uh, this guy isn't bad, Huh? It's not bad for a college professor.

Speaker 1:          08:36          Um, so anyway, what I learned was that gamers have put together a whole bunch of different types of technologies to make themselves better. That's great. But also that they had created entertainment of doing it by doing it because the platform had afforded it and the platform that [inaudible] three things that are really important, right? It gave them a sense of ownership. So in other words, what people could do by modifying the game from a play experience to a viewership product. Give them a sense of ownership. That's what Henry Jenkins not at USC is called a moral economy, right? So if your platform can afford a little bit of moral of the economy from your audience, that's a win because now they're invested, right? That requires people to give away, give, give up. The idea that any media product is, is a done product. Who here has written anything or design something and you sort of set it out in the world, right?

Speaker 1:          09:39          And then you think, gee, that's it. I will struggle. Then I sweat. And that was, but then what would you do if someone comes along and Margit modifies it in some way changes, it creates friction out of it. The idea is that the platform should have an element of, um, welcoming things that are modifications of media, existing media products, which would be a derivative work. Right? But that gives people ownership. That's great. The other thing is belonging. The sense of belonging is anybody here know the term? Brony. Okay. Could you, okay. Should I clarify that for folks? A brony is typically a young man between the ages of 18 or even younger and however, who has an affinity? A fanish affinity fans. They're fans of my little pony. My little pony is a TV series from the 1980s features are little pony. They're kind of cute.

Speaker 1:          10:32          Any who, um, this fan group would have been an isolated fan group if it hadn't been for the web. Right? Once they get on the web and started talking about it, they created an emergent culture. Now you can go to a comic con, right? Does anybody here at bent to comicon? I'm sure many people have been to comic con. If you go to Comicon, you'll see people playing, doing cosplay on a my little pony. The point of this is that the platform of, let's say the Internet, if we're going to talk in a big terms, created a space for culture to exist to happen to exist outside of, let's say your own small group of people or even just yourself, right? Culturally requires more than one video. Game. Culture is the same way, right? It, especially around this particular genre of video game commentary that if it wasn't for the fact that a platform afforded communication with others about the game and things that maybe were experienced in the game, then that sense of cultural belonging is something that's bigger than yourself.

Speaker 1:          11:30          It would have been lost. You would have maybe had friends to play with maybe land parties, but otherwise there wouldn't be anything bigger or that grows. So that's great for the platform. And then freedom of movement, freedom of movement means the idea that the platform isn't locked up, that the feature set interfaces with other feature sets that may not necessarily be owned by your platform. Right. Okay. So I'm going to quickly bring myself up to date because you know, I talk and then my notes, we'll recycle it refocused me. All right, so these are the three sort of the, the magic recipe, right? The triumvirate. And let's see, here we go. He covered it. All of these. And then are we good at this guy? Uh, the ghost in the shell. If you're going to have a platform, right? That is going to afford a level of plasticity of a level of user or power.

Speaker 1:          12:29          You're going to have to be prepared for indeterminacy and surprises, right? Things are gonna happen in, in a system that is already chaotic because there are so many moving parts that are going to be wholly unexpected game designers notice, right? They call it emergence emergence in AI but also emergency and player, uh, um, behavior. But also you can think of it as emergency and user behavior. And I think the youtube gaming community show that particularly well, right? Things happen on the youtube game community. I think we're entirely unexpected. The twitch thing is the twitch plays. Pokemon is great, but also the fact that there is such a thing as a video game commentary. And this is before youtube gaming, by the way. So all my references are historical. Yes, Youtube gaming now exists, but it wouldn't have existed if it hadn't first existed as youtube video commentary for years before that.

Speaker 1:          13:19          Right? This starts in 28, 2008, 2009 and youtube came, he didn't come out until 2015. Right? So it took a whole year as a response to this level of user activity, right? And as a responsible for the competition, twitch was really ready to, to dole out on that particular field, right? So you gotta be ready for surprises and video game commentary. Communities provided the proof of that, that they were going to do interesting and new things. And okay, so you want to have a platform that gives you some plasticity, some user control, belonging, a sense of belonging, moot freedom of movement. Um, and let me go back to that one and ownership, right? But then you have to balance it because, well, you are a corporation, so, all right? Uh, it has to be balanced with some things. Uh, you have to have the freedom to create, play, right?

Speaker 1:          14:16          To be able to play in the platform at the same time. That has to be balanced with three things, overly grabby copyright regimes. Obviously that's the death star with a big C. Right? And all your creativity are belong to us. Does anybody know that particular reference to video game culture? Right? Uh, there's a, there's a great video game from the 80s that it was, it was dubbed over with, with dicey English and it's an, all your base are belong to us. It's awesome. So it'd become, it's become a thing in video. So now every time we talk about something ridiculous, like I'm going to get you, we say all your base are belong us. So that's why I have it on there. All your co it creativity or belong to us. So you don't want to be this deathstar you don't want to be the platform, right?

Speaker 1:          14:58          That says all your creativity are belong to us. You do not. Right. Especially with with w when the culture is one of sharing and the culture is one of participation with the culture is one of performance, right? Um, that is going to be a hard sell. Okay. So there is overly grabby copyright regimes purposefully designed in compatibility between platforms. You don't want to close off your platforms. The reason that youtube system worked was because it was pretty open. Who here can a, has ever seen the CBS logo show up in the NBC and an NBC program broadcast anywhere, anytime ever in mass media. Never. Never. Right. Yeah, but you're on youtube. They have a Twitter logo. You guys are mixing your copy, you guys are mixing your, your trademarks and you don't care because your platform around the youtube platform is open to others. That is a win.

Speaker 1:          15:53          If you, if I were to use economics, I would say that's a great example of the Nash Equilibrium, right? Of maximizing overall wealth by loosening, by making decisions about choices. Right? That that account for at the end, everybody wins state like a zero sum game. Right? All right. So it has to be a certain acceptance of chaos, right? Um, that users are, aren't really, users are going to do what ads and a particular brand of use or a particular type of participatory user is going to do it much more so than others. But these might be the users that you want to foster an afford cause they are the most creative. They're going to, they're inventing things on the fly and they wish they could do it. Right. Uh, so let me give you the perspective from a video gamer. Someone like myself, right? Yes, I am.

Speaker 1:          16:49          I, that's the other thing. You can't really talk about a medium, right? Unless you really, I don't know, Taco, unless you submerge yourself in it. Um, you know, it's really important to just really be veracious, right? About a medium that you love and, you know, talk about. Um, okay. So here it goes. This is the view of the youtube platform from, uh, a Gamer's perspective circa 2009. We'll start with what did video gamers who are going to put stuff online? Sage was the profit motive of Youtube. This is it. This is it. This, it's basically they didn't care to that as far as they're concerned is the gnome plan for profit, right? Uh, they knew, you'd said was, could a collecting everything. That's the metaphor. The underpants just collect anything that's visual. The profit motive or the profits system was unknown to them, or they didn't care at the beginning.

Speaker 1:          17:42          Uh, and all they really cared about was playing and sharing their passion. That was it. That who here knows about creative communities is anybody who participated in a creative community, creative communities tend to not care about the profit motive too much, especially in the stages when we were in the stage and when they're putting up there their rough drafts, right? It's important for them to share, but the profit motive is really not always in their scheme of thinking. And this is why I have, this isn't one of my favorite elements of south park or moments in south park when they presented the plan for profit, which is basically the beginning. This is how they saw it. But of course that changed right? When partnerships rolled in and when you do partnerships rolled in with machinima partnerships. So showing up, then that changed and the profit motive became very real.

Speaker 1:          18:34          Then their mindset changes. But this is the beginning. This is the other thing that's really important. Who can recognize this particular image? Anybody? Yeah, there we go. That is working. I think I've stitched, watched it again the other day. Uh, this is one of the first true representations of video game culture. And this is 19, what, 84, 85. So what Youtube Youtube commentators did was recreate this moment. They recreated this moment. I know I'm going to date myself. Okay. And the 80s after I got out of school, I would gather my quarters from my, the pittance of my paper route and I would head over to the, to Jimmy smoke shop in new Britain, Connecticut. It's a post industrial town, not a lot of money to go around and were just working class kids. And we had quarters and we didn't have Atari. So we would go to the arcade and play video games, things like a lag or a pac man or whatever and meet other people and talk about the games and learn how, how to better play the game and develop culture in situ on site.

Speaker 1:          19:38          Right. Um, maybe meet some cool older kids who were much better at it. We would even cheer and we would tribalized right. Ah, you're, have you like Bob's way of playing Pac man? He's a punk. Uh, all these things were real, but in flesh and bomb, the culture existed in flesh and Bonk. Right. And we got to talk shit to each other. We got to call each other names, um, calling each other's moms names, whatever it was, right. Instead of going to play basketball, maybe cause we used to do that. You have them anyway. Play basketball on the city. If you play basketball in inner city, talking smack is like a skill. Okay. So if you, if you don't talk smack, you saw it, just you or even worse, you know. Uh, so you had the talk yet talk smack. That was how it was.

Speaker 1:          20:25          And if you could read, if I wish I could, I wish there were a cam quarters back then or cell phones that I could record it because I, it, it existed. Youtube created that again, not in the same way. It wasn't flushing born. It wasn't at the same time. It was, you know, um, across time zones and in, but you got to talk a lot of crap. You got to cheer for your friends, got to do all these things. Uh, and you got to meet New People. So Youtube when we created this, I don't know if they did it inadvertently or whether the gamers who were putting the stuff up there knew it, this is what they were doing. Or maybe it's just the way the medium works. But this is one of the reasons why it also works, right? Because whatever it is about video game culture, this kind of competitive play and come ridership and smack talky existed before just not online. It exists. So just reproduced. So that's another thing that it afforded that the platform afforded, right? Importing external cultures, that's really important. Uh, uh, practices. So does anybody recognize any of this era plate? So I'm think talking about one particular game because it was sort of the most popular game of the time, uh, on the Xbox and playstation platforms, right? Modern warfare series.

Speaker 1:          21:43          Okay. Y'all play video games, I'm assuming. And some gay video games just have elements of suck, right? They might be great in some respects, but there are other elements that just stank and you, you know it when you're playing it and you think, God, I wish I could just tell the designers how has it just socks or, um, talk to somebody about how much, so this is a little poster of the most hated elements of modern warfare two and I'm going to focus on this one, boosting a, if you've played this game, I'll give you the game mechanic real quickly. Uh, let's say you're in competitive play and someone, you know, you get, you get knocked out on the competition, respond back in, but there's a thing you can attack in certain places. You, you break the stick, you put it down and you will respond exactly where that insert was located.

Speaker 1:          22:27          Great. You get, you get, you get to respond. But people started doing that so they can get kill streaks so he can get an award so that you would get your buddy to show up in there and online play and you'd sit or cabin a corner, you know, sneaky in this crack this thing. And then you shoot each other in the head a couple of times and just keep spawning. There's a ridiculous right. And it was game breaking because you sitting there playing the game, you're, you're super competitive, you're doing it and then you hear and you hear it in the sand because you have your headset to cause your bass player. Right? Cause you, you know what you're doing, you have your surrounds it and you thinking who the hell is cheating? So you started trolling going on the map. You few forget the objective of the game because you know someone's in some corner of shooting, you know cheating. So you go around and you're looking around and you find the realize they're cheating and all don't she where she could test. So you get to go in the lobby and talk about it, but not no more talking about it no more. Let's say you get until, Oh let me make sure this is science cause this guy gets pretty serious about it.

Speaker 1:          23:36          Is he a boy? It's slow. Oh there it is. So this kind of made a series of videos on tracking these cheaters. And you know, making their lives difficult, uh, for cheating. So he, but he was pretty exciting. He did it pretty interesting Joe about it. Um, I want to race him just a little bit kiss maybe.

Speaker 2:          23:59          Uh,

Speaker 1:          24:06          and he's a fan of hard rock. So chat looking who hey on that. So he would find his chairs and, and little corners of that map and put and put, put the, put the hurting on him and really creative ways like throwing sand tax at, um, and you, you understand, you share the ovary, that's Duke Nukem. So not only was she used a number of interaction, not only what he, this is awesome. And he was on Justin TV by the way. So he was on the first live streamers. I'm just in TV circa 2009. Um, sorry. Yeah. So his thing was, his said became entertained. So this moment that you had in video game culture, right, and the, and you're playing at home or playing with friends of hating on the game became entertainment for you. Right. Who here has ever had some, who here has gone to the dentist and felt, you know, and had a terribly nickel, particularly painful, then that's just experience and then gone online and watched other people have it and laughed hysterically.

Speaker 1:          25:04          And I don't know, maybe you're crazy like that, but I haven't. But this, that's the idea. It took something that was a user experience, right? In video games, I was objectionable. I, someone's cheating. People get angry and made entertainment. It made the kind of TV journalist called people, uh, uh, characters you love to hate. Right? So that was afforded by the platform and the creativity of the user. But think of what, how many intellectual property products went into that particular cut. There's, there's, uh, some rock music and I think she used to use Metallica until the copyright strikes started coming in Berlin town, right? Uh, he's using Duke Nukem voiceovers, you know, like a tasty, right? Things like that. And that comes, that's an intellectual property product. And I don't know if youtube has an Algo to be recognize those kinds of, uh, sound inputs, but that's still going.

Speaker 1:          25:58          So I don't think so. Um, so these are a number of Loosey Goosey applications of transformative works, right? Um, to make that happen. Now I've been talking about features that keep cobbled together and media can be a cobbled together in a platform that allows all this to happen, right? But it's not just one platform is a number of platforms. Think of it as a brick collage. That was pretty fancy word for a gaming guy. So it, it just means like a, a hodgepodge, right? You put it all together to make this one. So think of the experience of this sort of creating a 14 play as a, a collage of features. It's, it's bigger than the one than the one platform. If the plastic, here's Twitter, right? I mean, come on. How many, you know, youtube has his Twitter, you can set a little Twitter icon there somewhere.

Speaker 1:          26:50          Um, how often has this happened that a platform is just entirely of, any media is open to other inputs from other media that's really unique. That is not something that happens often. And there might be some cases, but I think in mass media, and I always, when I say it's unique, I say it's unique and meet it mass me to do not have this uh, traditional mass media, digital media because of the network environment. Do have it. So let me scroll here. So my notes, I'm staying on track. Yes I am. Okay, good. All right. This allowed for a certain kind of narrative to evolve when you hear a story or when you read a story, right? It's to book, right? Or it's the, it's the podcast. So it's the radio. What if the story stopped at the book? I said follow, follow the rest of the story on Twitter.

Speaker 1:          27:43          I follow the [inaudible] study on Youtube. So that is the idea. I'm trying to get at that. The narratives, the stories that they were told through this video language, we're not just confined to the one they were across platforms. So the plasticity is not just about all of the features sets, it's about the ways in which the one mass that's, we'll call it the central platform. Youtube allowed the other one's in and out and so allowed users to flow through right there. My favorite example is the Twitter beef. I love Twitter beefs. They're so fun. So these commentators, which each Twitter beef, they start hating on each other on Twitter, right? Like in high school or middle school you hated on each other and the English class and then you went outside and settle your differences. Or maybe you challenge each other to a dual, I don't know, whatever it was this, they would start Twitter be so here on Twitter and then the story would continue somewhere in the channel where they would have themselves some, some, some heat, go back and forth and then they would go somewhere else.

Speaker 1:          28:50          Then it would go to, on the comments section is there, this was staged in a lot of cases. They just had called each other up. We were actually good friends and they say, why don't we, you know, our viewers of viewership is a little down or why don't we stage some drama? And it would, but it had flow throughout. So let's say you're at school and you're wondering, well, how much hate Barb is giving the Jan today? So you go on Twitter and various sort of firing up your, your video, right? A youtube APP. You just kind of go on Twitter and see where the heat is at. He out, unfortunately I'm using here, doesn't like sometimes it was collaboration and some sort of like projects that they were working on. So these things are, but it wouldn't be possible. This sort of multimodal narrative about, uh, of one media product when you parcel, unless there was this plasticity civilly link things together.

Speaker 1:          29:40          Um, so users are like kittens, um, especially when they're given a significant amount of freedom. They will create things, they will mess things up. Sometimes they will import things that you didn't expect, but there will also be super cute, uh, like kittens. No, maybe not sort of super cute, but they will also put together things that you did not expect they will create for you. All right. Um, my summary of this and the narratives that evolve will be multimodal. Uh, it's a real interesting way to look at it. And in terms of discrete infinity, that all these different elements to the platforms that you put together, the, does anybody here, does everybody know the term, the screen infinity? Maybe this great infinity is the idea that you have limited modules but infinite possibilities, right? Limited components, infant outputs. It's a term from linguistics to explain why limited number of phenoms or letters can produce infinite number of words, right?

Speaker 1:          30:49          Or it's also in AI and limited number of circuitry. Yours things crews on indeterminate number of outputs. All right? So if you can create a modular platform that affords playfulness, not only with its feature set, but also with the way the content is mashed up and other platforms, you will have discrete infinity, you will have a near infinite resource for creativity. That's my hypothesis. That's my findings. I think I, things happen in these platforms that I could never have expected and I don't think getting machine could ever have computed the possibilities. So I love this image. This image is my metaphor for well-designed platform. There are rules to this game that these kids are playing, right? But there are nearly invisible to them. And the ball is the platform and they are in conversation with that platform and that platform is in conversation with them.

Speaker 1:          31:49          It is adapting to them, right? They all kick it, right? They'll make it go in one direction or another, but they're an effect. The game that they're playing with it revolves around the nearly invisible rules, which they all know, right? Which they function within and the physics of the ball, but also the magic that happens when you're playing quickly and a ball goes somewhere on direct, uh, unexpected. It's just the metaphor. All right, so what are the takeaways? Let's say, what did we learn and how is it possible you're the audience participation side of it also has a lot to do with who is contributing.

Speaker 1:          32:27          I cannot emphasize this enough, these users, we're not thinking about copyright strikes. They could not care less, right? They could not care less. It was the latter. It only was part of their imaginary. When they got a copyright strike, channel's got shut down. When music was pulled, for whatever reason, one of my videos was yanked when on my channel because I decided, I decided to use, it's beginning to look a lot like Christmas. Right? And it lasted 24 hours before I got yanked on my channel because, well, there's a copyright strike on it. So, but I care because all I know I have to care about copyright. But these, these folks could do not. And that's the other thing that there is some audiences, just our in state, maybe in life, right? 18 to 12, 12 to 18 year olds that just don't care. Um, and sometimes that's the best place that there's a, there's a great book called the art of not giving a shit.

Speaker 1:          33:20          Um, and there's an element to that in creativity and gamers have that humans have that in the way hackers do, in the positive way. Hackers that hacker, the majority of science, and there's hackers, you know, curious folks who are tinkerers who like to play with things. If you give those a culture days playful with things, the ability to play with them, they will create things for you, right? So these are my findings. Obviously the intellectual property, uh, narrative and the profit motive kicks in some companies that are more than others, but ultimately I think the findings are all that a belonging sense of belonging, a sense of ownership and freedom of movement are the key elements. These things will limit them, but the corporate culture is actually really important. All right? So things like copyright, things like contractual agreements with your users from third party owners, these things will limit or create a balance in the balance and the platform designer has to design that balance into it. But the corporate culture has a lot to do with it actually hacker culture as well. Um, and of all this, of all the communities that I've studied in my lifetime, online video game, a video game, players are a lot like hackers, um, and the corporate culture.

Speaker 1:          34:50          Does anybody here ever modded a video game? So I was right. So

Speaker 1:          34:58          video game industry has been really open to letting its trade secrets and intellectual properties out of the door, right? That's hacker culture in its, in its essence, right? Here's the source code hack away at it lets you, I remember I hated, I didn't hate him, I love the physics and quake three, but I kind of wanted to run next to a missile sometimes. So, and I went in there and I hacked away at it and I slowed the missile speed down. So then I would just sit there and run next to a missile and they do crazy things because it was fun to do it and people, and I put that modern mine and people downloaded the mod. So the point is that of all the industries, the media and the creative industries, video game sense, it'd be a little less, a little more open to letting their platforms be converted a little bit, the modified, right.

Speaker 1:          35:50          So that new creative things can happen. Uh, so corporate culture is important. I would imagine. My dream platform for media sharing is one that is modular, wondering which a user can pick and choose. The kinds of presentations that the kinds of formats, um, that he or she wants to present and how they want to present them. And each page, each user page is you unique youtube experience. It's still youtube, but it's Jane, Jane's Youtube. All right? So these are the three Cs of success, right? And it was these three seniors probably existed already. And if you've worked for you to be, you probably know that they were doing this, but it wasn't obvious to, to the viewership. But after following this community for long enough, it is, to me, there's subscribers are the common, the common currency, um, and that you have to have ways of catching them or recruiting them, growing your audience.

Speaker 1:          36:48          And that can be done in a number of ways. The first is, of course, great content. Yes, people will show up, but also you would like to show, uh, incentivize them to come. So maybe giveaways. All right. Uh, so I, the first time, I think the first time any user generated content, um, for video games which showed up on the, on the homepage, the splash page or youtube was when one gamer x jaws is, I had to do a giveaway and if you rate comment as described, he would put your name. He was giving away x boxes, I mean big giveaway. And I just like, oh, I'll give you some like, uh, I'll give you candy. No, like big things. And he started getting millions of views. His subscriber base tripled. So he had a great catching strategy. He got a lot of hate for right from the rest of the community.

Speaker 1:          37:37          Cause it's supposed to be a meritocracy, but there's other ways of catching it. You making, uh, entertain content and to entertaining content requires maybe staging a beef or some drama and people show up and that catches them cashing them. That means you have to keep them right. And so that's engagement through other platforms. Again, because the platform afforded it, they were able to put the little Twitter out and tell them, hey, I'm going to be on or have a hosted lobby. And lastly, caching him. And that is the partnership programs. Initially there were no partnership programs initially. You know, you have to have certain number of viewership. Once word got around, the profit motor really kicked in for them. Um, but again, the platform afforded it. So what's the take them ultimately concluding you fast questions if you have them is jazz fans. This is, uh, uh, a picture of the recording of a miles Davis kind of blue, right? Some jazz fans considered this proof of the existence of God. All right. Uh, because, uh, Ge, uh, David's basically gave his, uh, his, uh, content, key signatures and tempo. And then they went at it and they created a tonal jazz and, and a number of settings. Uh, creativity flow. That's because the platform, the rules of the platform, the structure, we're fixed in tempo key, right? But everything else was up to the players.

Speaker 1:          39:02          And that if you, if I think if platform designers start to see their users as players and afford play and just give basic directions, what will come out at the end will be the next miles Davis, the next Michelangelo, the next, um, whomever, right? Genius. If you have enough, if you will be happy or at least designers will be happy that they built the tools, they gave them, the canvases that they were able to use to become those geniuses. Um, so that's the take home message is the balance between structure and play. And we've seen users as playful agents, not as folks that you need to shut today. You need to structure their behavior too much. And the video game commentary community and the beginning historically really showed that twitch is a lot of ways doing crazy, not crazy things. I would say they're structures are far looser.

Speaker 1:          40:03          I see. I've seen things on twitch. I mean I've been having, looking at the web for 20 years, um, that made my jaw drop. I'm like, wow. And they, they've monetized it. Um, so the content can be loosey Goosey. Sometimes it's, it's problematic. But those that's sort of the price. You sometimes pay a more, more, you have to curate a little bit more effectively. And when you're going to let go, may I create a little bit more chaos that your users do? What apps? That's the take home message. That's how a platform affords play and um, balances between the structure and the, uh, the ghost in the shell. Any questions, comments? Yeah,

Speaker 3:          40:48          we would talk about your experience or comment on kind of like how you think, like things in the flesh now are kind of like real life game play and kind of ties in with all these concepts you're talking about.

Speaker 1:          40:59          Yeah, I think, you know, one of the, one of the mistakes I think a lot of internet scholars do a is thing that, you know, the culture is self contained, right? But a lot of live action role play, right? So in those cases you are taking ganging scenarios and putting them elsewhere, right? And live action and carrying them out. And sometimes a game mechanics are flawed in the game. We've, you know, we've had, at least the group I did it with was, uh, was a, uh, failed failed feature. Larb so it would be something like a, um, ridiculous, like, uh, the, in modern warfare two, it was a second chance where, you know, the guy sitting there like, you shot him a thousand times, but he's still kinda can get at you and that's everybody considered a fail. So one person got a ticket that was like, you get to be that guy that ruins it for everybody and nobody knew, right?

Speaker 1:          41:52          So it affects, you know, it, it, it created this and it reinforced the meaning that we had in the game. Right? Or sometimes we would do something in Larb that we would then carry into the game, right? There would be one guy who'd be, um, uh, you know, instead of, instead of, uh, instead of it being as a team death match, one guy would activate a grenade instead of running around, you know, and they're going to blow up on you soon, right? So he was the guy you had to find. Uh, but that's something we had done in labs. So, if that's what you mean. Yeah. So there is this fluency between external cultures and internal culture in the game and the fact that we could do it outside and bring it into, let's say lobby recorded and then put it on and became a genre onto itself.

Speaker 1:          42:44          Right? So there were some lobbies you would walk in and they weren't actually playing the objective of the game. They were playing an objective they had devised somewhere else. So you went into search and destroy and it wasn't searching to start with something else. Um, you went into team death match to replace something else and that was the two. So creativity, right. Did designers never met the game to be that, but someone, some group in Lockton are that, um, or they reinforce some sort of notion of what the game should be? So I think that's what you mean. Yes. Yeah. These are the conversations between the external and internal. The flushing bond on the digital. I really important. And if the platform allows for that and the fandom allows for that, then you have an opening door for creative spaces. Yeah. Yeah. Slab action, write plays create really fun.

Speaker 3:          43:36          Yeah. I mean, I guess in general, like I'm very curious about like how things manifest in like in real life or how like what can be done in real life that can or cannot read, but we replicate it like on a digital platform. So what would that be like Lara? Absorb like args um, like immersive theater, you know, like what are the applications of it and like, you know, if you're thinking about the form of theater itself is something that may arguably be like somewhat fizzling out, right? Like what does it look like when you inject these new ideas and do it right?

Speaker 1:          44:08          I think audience participation. So for example, if, um, video game, right? When when I, when we were in, in the arcades and we were participating in the game play, if someone were to tell you, would you ever really watch someone on TV or on play a video game, people are going to know. But actually, yeah, people were doing it for a long time for watching other people play games for a long time. Right. Uh, so the idea is find, find media engagement exercises if people do together in which others, others take joy in watching others do. Right? We all watch, we all love watching other people fail at sports height way. It's just, it's comedy, right? We watched and we watched and just epic fail, epically fail. Uh, we can't play the sport. We are probably worse than they are. Uh, they're not as good, but we like watching that.

Speaker 1:          45:00          So those are the things that I think people pour into the, let's say, a video experience when it's a flesh and bone experience, when there is an element of enjoyment and viewership on another. So theater, right? Um, I can't think of any other than sort of sports fails. Uh, or, yeah, sports shows me the first thing that comes to mind where people like, like to watch other folks sort of fumble on themselves. Trip triple level. Uh, and if that's what you mean in terms of performances, I think that's as close as I can get. But in video games, um, children playing with the, we has anyone seen a small child who does not yet have full control of their motor skills play with a Weise thick, they beat each other with it. It's hilarious. I wish that was on youtube, right? Uh, I know children but things like that where it was a family moment.

Speaker 1:          45:56          It was hilarious. A little Bobby just whacked Jimmy over the head with that damn stick. And you, you're lucky you have that little rubber thing on it. But it's, it's these elements of like that video game culture that only happens in video because the kids get fired up about it. But there might be other elements in and participatory culture in theater or in uh, music, right. Music fails are great as well. I know fails and focusing on fails, but they tend to be funny. And I got, I got beaten in the face one time with a baseball. Everybody laughed, including myself, you know, it's just like, okay, just got beat. So fails tend to be kind of funny. It's slapstick. Any questions? Comments? Yes.

Speaker 4:          46:39          So you talked about a video game community as well. Um, so there's communities on Reddit, there's communities on twitch, streamer communities. Do you have any insights on what makes a community successful? Okay,

Speaker 1:          46:52          yes. Um, there has to be a common language, right? [inaudible] and what I mean by language, some symbolic, right? So everybody comes to it with an already existing experience and they discover that they all share that particular symbolic experience and then they start to circulate it. If it's a particularly robust experience, then that congeals a community really quickly. Like for example, the Brownie example, they started on Reddit, right? Everybody had the general, these, every member of that community had the general experience of loving that particular product and they didn't have any place to present that until reddit and others affirmed it and it was so strong. That connection there that can do it almost instantaneously, that community came together. Uh, so there has to be something that ties in together, some sort of common symbology. Right? And that's strength. Then there's also the dynamics. Um, there is sometimes you know, roles emerging communities and at that point you have the best communities are usually communities are tend to be horizontal, they tend to congeal, the leadership is sparse.

Speaker 1:          48:05          So whenever someone starts to be a leader, too much of a leader, it tends to not work out. That tends to sort of, you know, then people tribalized eco against each others. There's beef, there's anger. So horizontal communities tend to be a pretty effective common symbology, strong symbology. Um, and the last of their, I think it keeps communities together is persistent. So rest of the three big social proof, a reciprocity and consistency tend to be re. So if they were start gifting in the economy, that's a big deal. Uninvited gifts are a huge deal. Who here has been ever been given an uninvited gift? How compelled where you, you wanted to give back? Right. That is a very strong social norm across cultural. It doesn't matter if someone gives you something you immediately want to give. So that sort of a community in which people are spontaneously gifting is really tied together.

Speaker 1:          49:06          Reciprocity, that's important, right? Social proof. If one particular element of the community is affirmed by others that makes that particular element, um, our grounding element. So everybody wears red on Thursdays and everybody was more than few, then it becomes a thing that people do. Right. So, and then consistency, a persistence of those things over time. That just means people have to practice it over and over again and sticking to what they say. I said I was going to do that. These reciprocity is probably the strongest, you know, in a situation like that information is a gift. So if you're in a community and you share information that wasn't as useful for the community,

Speaker 2:          49:50          Ooh,

Speaker 1:          49:52          reciprocity immediately kicks in. So those are the things. Thank you. Yep.

Speaker 2:          49:59          What else? All right. All right.

Speaker 5:          50:02          I have a question. Oh, go ahead. I'm not sure if you're familiar with the video game split tune. Uh, it's been a while, but yeah, with that one, there's some game modes that are actually closed off at specific points in time and open up during certain periods of time where certain days. Um, and I always find that fascinating because it's like the game itself is restricting you from playing the game, but it seems to work really well in terms of players get, uh, during specific days and that there's always someone to play against. And I think maybe some of that design has actually been impacted by east sports culture because I think Splatoon is often featured is one of Nintendo's key sports titles right now. So I was wondering how east sports culture has influenced the design of video games over time and if there's any trends in design that have resulted from that.

Speaker 1:          50:51          Yes. Video Games since the e sports and see Mlg crew hit, hit, hit, hit, hit the airwaves, right? Uh, they ha the designers will tap them for ideas in terms of the kinds of play, the kinds of tech they might want to use. Um, that has been, that's a mixed bag of success and not as a player, right. As a, because East sports players require, require fast twitch reflects, um, a particular type of competitive, um, tech technological interface that a regular player may not. Right. Or, and so our user may not an that casual user or a person or a very committed fan. I mean I find that particularly use phone. Right. Um, I know, um, I remember commentary once where they were asking the designers were asking some MLG players what they thought would be great for call of duty and the community with what I'm saying.

Speaker 1:          51:49          Yeah. So it depends on what, what it might be in terms of that, of the game. You mentioned the design element also works to another very kind of sociologically grounded way of seeing things. Um, exclusivity. So if content is delivered in segments and you have to work for it, it makes that particular segment of the content seem exclusive, that only a few people can get it. That you have to go a certain distance. You know, it's, you have to labor a little bit and that creates all about a value to it. So Games are designed, those kinds of systems, um, you'll see people laboring effectively, you know, they call it the grind. People will grind and world of Warcraft for a certain amount of hours, right? So they can get a certain amount of like upper denture item. Um, but that's different I think. I think where we saw the MLG, where I studied MLG thing really kick in was in things like in video games, like call of duty or in things as on trick shots. KDS or choke to death ratios or things like on gear that you used. Oh, our Astros for example, um, surrounds on headsets because the Mlg people use it. Everybody wanted to use it. Right? So those, those are kind of like product, like straight up branding and product placement and, um, endorsements. So yeah, but it informs, but not absolutely.

Speaker 1:          53:30          Okay. Last chance. All right. Thank you.

Speaker 2:          53:38          [inaudible].
