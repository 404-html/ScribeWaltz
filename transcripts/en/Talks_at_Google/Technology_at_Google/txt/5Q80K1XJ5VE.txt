Speaker 1:          00:08          Hi everyone. Thank you all for coming to today's fireside chat with Craig Newmark. This event is part of a talks at Google program and today's fireside chat is hosted by in a Google internal community called Wikipedians at Google. Thank you for all for being here. My name is Dan and Joe. Today's jewelry is open ad go cracked dash dory and I already add some of the questions from the RSVP. Please feel free to use that link to add your questions and vote. Uh, we are super happy here, uh, to have a well renowned intrepreneur and philanthropist Mr. Crack mark re new mark, founder of craigslist and crowd Craig Newmark Foundation crack is born in 1952 in New Jersey and moved to San Francisco around 1990 around 1995 he started a mailing list which ultimately turned into craiglist.org one of the world's most successful online classified advertisement websites. Nowadays, he focused more on philanthropy efforts with a crack and new mark foundation and hasn't been involved in management since 2000 while he caught himself still doing some lightweight customer service. Please welcome Craig

Speaker 2:          01:30          folks. Thanks. And I really do wear Kangle hats like this, but it's too warm in here now. Yeah. What I'd like to do is speak a bit about a founding craigslist. Why I did it, I'll talk a little bit, but what about the technology than I normally do, a given the audience, I'm going to talk about the philanthropic philosophy I developed without consciously thinking about it along those lines. And I'm going to talk about the philanthropy I've engaged with right now, including connections to Wikipedia and also to, uh, something called Google news because I'm actually highly involved with that. In fact, I'll just begin by saying, so I don't forget that a Google news folks are doing really good, really important work, particularly involving the countering of disinformation that includes, uh, trying to get the names right. Richard Gingras, Steve Grove, a Erica Anderson and Olivia Ma. I'm probably missing some names, but those are the ones that come to mind immediately.

Speaker 2:          02:42          So I may repeat a little bit more about that. But, uh, something I mentioned the head too is I spent 17 years at IBM and I saw frequently, especially in the field, people were not given credit for stuff they did. So I overdo it. I spent a couple of years of Charles Schwab for that matter going around the company at lunch, things telling people that the Internet would be a thing. Sunday, this was 94 mostly. And the guy who started the, uh, web at a Charles Schwab, a guy named Doris Milosky has been a forgotten except that I keep bringing his name up at things like this. Um, keep track of time for me cause I don't want to go crazy with it. Uh, my ideal is that I am a nerd of the old school, uh, born in, you know, the early fifties, grew up through the fifties and sixties. There's a stereotype about a guy who wears a plastic pocket protector, thick black glasses, taped together and no social skills.

Speaker 2:          03:47          That was me in completely, literally in high school two times. I really had my thick black glass is broken and I tried taping them together until I got replacements. No social skills and even now what you see before you is a simulation of social skills. And I can do that for about 90 minutes after which things start going south and I become, I become a cranky. Um, my ideal, you know, is that I got a couple of degrees in computer sciences at Case Western case tech in the mid Seventies. Although I've learned coding in high school in 1969 using punch cards for Tran too, and an IBM 1620. I feel like I should make it your homework assignment to look up a all three, but you'll be frightened. However, I can assure you that the 1620 was from that generation of computers, which had the blinky lights and they literally did have the blinky lights and I kind of miss that.

Speaker 2:          04:57          Not that I'm going to be searching a surplus for, uh, for one of those, it was about the size of a player piano. Anyway, you know, after some point I decide to leave IBM, I get myself hired by Charles Schwab who brings me to San Francisco, which I appreciate and I got a lot of help from people around town on the net using it. Newsgroups well helping me with a neighborhoods around town, helping me with uh, you know, restaurants and how to get around. And this was pretty good, you know, so early 95 rolls around and I'm leaving Charles Schwab at the time, but I'm thinking I should give back. So I started as simple mailing list and basically what it is is I'm using a very advanced email tool back in [inaudible] 95 called pine. And you know, I figure it's just a CC list, 10 12 people to start with events that involve arts and our technology.

Speaker 2:          05:56          And then I, uh, you know, just the people tell me about more stuff and I do more stuff. People started asking me to do different things and I go along with that. But about the middle of a 95, the CC list stuff at about 250 addresses breaks. And I need to use a list server, somebody volunteers, major Domo, and as an old school, neuro dime, very literal. So I'll call it San Francisco events. People around me that are smarter than me, they say we already call it craigslist, keep calling it that it signifies it will be personal in the quirky. And then they explained to me what a brand is. A seriously, I didn't know those of you, uh, in marketing. We should have cause to mark me. But anyway, I learned a what it is, I was 42 at the time and uh, that made a lot of sense to me.

Speaker 2:          06:54          So it's craigslist, um, just kept plugging away for a few years all by myself. Uh, one interesting thing in 97 was that people at job posters ask me to charge them for their ads. Why? Um, they thought they were getting better results in the list. Um, but a better results than paying expensive headhunters or whatever for it to help them get people. So I figured I w a philosophy might be to charge people for ads, people who already paid for ads, but to charge them a much less money for more effective ads. And that's a practice we continue to this day. The side is almost all free, but we do charge for ads specifically at times to minimize abuse. Like in New York apartment brokers in Manhattan, the New York apartment brokers can really, uh, damaged people like at the very last minute, they'll tell you if there's a big commission on an apartment and that's not okay.

Speaker 2:          07:59          And speaking to them, we made a little dent in the problem, but I'm getting way ahead of myself. And in 97 also, uh, at that point we were hitting or I was hitting about a million page views per month, which at the end of 97 for a one person operation pretty good. And, uh, also Microsoft sidewalk and obsolete city site wanted to run banner ads, but I disliked banner ads. I, many of them I think are just kind of stupid. So I just decided that, uh, you know, I'm living comfortably enough. I don't need the extra income that grew into a, the lesson that, uh, but I was calling nerd values. If you make enough money to live comfortably and then to help your family, maybe some friends live comfortably, then it's more satisfying to change the world. And that's our philosophy to date. But are I, uh, people are also suggesting that I ran the site on a volunteer basis.

Speaker 2:          09:06          That's what happened in 98. Uh, [inaudible] even back then, things were easy. I recently saw a credit card bill from back then and I was running and craigslist on something called best Internet services, which is all gone now. But I was running the site, the name, well sorry, best internist. Yeah, they got bought by someone who was bought by someone else. And uh, but I was paying 35 bucks a month for hosting services back then and it, cause sometime in that timeframe, well before I get, before I used the services of volunteers, I was thinking, well, I'm using pine. I one point realized, oh, pine can output and email into a, a perl script. Pearl was hot then. And, uh, I figured, well, I can write some simple code which extracts the email headers because they were pretty predictable and I would have instant html pages, therefore instant publishing.

Speaker 2:          10:16          And that's how our site was born. I think that was late 96, but I don't remember because this was all a hobby and I wasn't taking notes. So on 98 rolls around, I try writing things from a, with volunteers and there to say a lot in a few words, people, some of the job posters who wanted to pay me, who started off that like a year before they approached me and said things were not working and they said if I wanted to craigslist and survive, I had to go full time, make it into a real company. And uh, they were right. Um, 99 I had to make tough decisions like how much to monetize. And again, I was thinking, you know, that nerd values thing. And I was thinking even from Sunday school, Mr and Mrs [inaudible] taught me, you know, to think how much is enough.

Speaker 2:          11:12          And in my case, not too much is enough. I do indulge myself in some ways. I buy all the books I want and things like that. But, uh, you know, I don't go crazy with things and I just gave up my old Prius 15 years old to a brother in law who has three, uh, kids who are driving now. You know, I have a feeling I may wind up regretting my decision and I have my eye on the Chevy Bolt, which is a good electric car and it has a lot of electronics on it, which I could fool around with and possibly injure myself. So they are, I am, you know, uh, these guys say I should, uh, start a new, you know, start my own company and by then even add lots of parties and stuff. I talked to a bankers and, uh, you know, vcs in this area and they are telling me, hey, I should, uh, monetize the usual silicon valley way and there will be putting billions of dollars on the table.

Speaker 2:          12:14          The answer again is how much do you need? Like, now that I've done a lot with philanthropy, I can see having a some billions to give away. It'd be pretty cool. But I also think about the philanthropic model of the robber barons who would acquire the equivalent of billions. They would acquire it by abusing their employees and their customers and then they would give back a little bit of it, you know, decades after the fact. So instead, I'm thinking, but craigslist is about, is helping people put food on the table. It's helping people find a table under which to put on the, on which to put the food. And then Craig's list is about finding a roof under which to put the table with the food. And so there's this a philanthropic model I've accidentally come up with, which is let someone trying to put food on the table, keep the money they would otherwise spend on advertising.

Speaker 2:          13:17          And that's a much more cost efficient, a model for philanthropy and so said and fewest words. The business model is doing well by doing good. And that worked out pretty well. Uh, I tried running the company myself for about a year and then some of the same people approached me and help me understand that as a manager I suck. Um, I'm emotionally unsuited to the hardest of, uh, management activities like hiring and firing people. I'm just not tough. Hired a Jim [inaudible], Jim Buckmaster to do the job. Uh, that's worked. And, uh, I figured around then I stopped programming because, you know, at 10 point around then we had hired a whole cadre of programmers, all of whom smarter than me, but I saw a need for myself to go full time in customer service because another Sunday school lesson was treated. People like you wanted to be treated.

Speaker 2:          14:24          And in business that means have serious customer service and you do the best you can. It's challenging when your site is mostly free. And that's probably an unsolvable problem in some regards. But that's what we, uh, that's what we were trying. And uh, it turns it over to Jim did customer service for a long time thing is in customer service online. You may have heard that, uh, you see some things that you can never unsee. You know, I have seen a certain amount of ugliness I've seen far more good, but the ugliness can get to you. And that's a big problem right now in user generated content and in commenting systems, there is a great need for keyword or keyword filtering kind of systems. That is actually this word filtering systems that can figure out bad stuff, um, in ways that doesn't rely on actually seeing specific keywords or doing basian filtering.

Speaker 2:          15:33          What's needed is software, which I don't think exists because I don't think AI juristics we'll solve that problem. Um, if anyone knows him or anything like that, I'd like to know. But, uh, um, I have a feeling the only thing I could do, the full customer service job would be actual strong AI. And I for one, welcome our machine overlords. Frankly, I'm beginning to feel like it's time for machine overlords. And when I say that, I'm not sure if I'm joking anymore. So that was a, you know, 2000 and since then Craig's list just grows. We're now in a whole bunch of more cities, a whole bunch more countries. Uh, the direction I, uh, put it in generally remains unchanged. Uh, folks may hear, may have noticed that we have changed the user experience, but stay consistent with design principles which say keep it simple and keep it fast.

Speaker 2:          16:34          Listen to what are the real needs and wants of people, not the fancy stuff. So you'll see that in our tables of contents, which are used to be things you scanned. There is fairly sophisticated database powering there. And uh, there's uh, you know, you'll be able to see thumbnails of the pictures which are in the things you'll be able to see. The whole picture is, uh, you'll be able to see maps and all the variants of that. Is he the last programming thing that I did? 99 or 2000? I don't remember when was, well back then I remember I was using pine, the Dataset, the database for craigslist back then was time, email folders. So, and pine is great. Pine forgive me in many respects, as much easier to use in Gmail. This is actually a, forgive me for bringing up the name. I had an extensive discussion on this with Marissa Meyer about 10 years ago, which is why there are some shortcuts in Gmail.

Speaker 2:          17:38          But the deal is that, uh, I was able to with a few commands to identify and remove all the old ads in a category with pine. And when pine email folders started proving to be a unsatisfactory, I switched to my SQL and that's when I stopped coding. Now and for the last several years, I do some, uh, what I call lightweight or token customer service to stay in touch with what's real because you want to find out what's going on with everything, what do people care about, what matters to people. And so I get to do that. Sometimes I handle a customer service email directly and also very frequently people will find me and social media and, uh, come up with requests, which I'm embarrassed to say I can't really help with. Um, so what I do with those is I generally, uh, just uh, share them with a main line customer service.

Speaker 2:          18:40          And I have to phrase it carefully because the Yahoo versus Barnes case makes it very clear that you can't imply you're going to solve a problem and you know, not, you know, and if you, if it slips between the cracks or you just forget or whatever, you have a problem. So that's craigslist. They're doing well by doing good. And again, I made that decision to monetize minimally in a 99, 2000, not altruistically, but it's just what feels right. Speaking as a nerd, as a person who is genuinely dysfunctional in these regards, uh, that's what happens sometimes. But in the last 10 plus years, over those years, people from nonprofit organizations were coming to me talking about how to, uh, how to build community, how to run sites, which might be the craigslist for something. And frankly too, they, at times they were hoping for a cash contributions and so on.

Speaker 2:          19:47          And I started getting organized regarding that. In 2011 it was something called Craig connects. And as branding that kind of sucks and it just didn't work very well. I'm pretty, uh, I'm more organized now and I have this thing, Craig Newmark, philanthropy's dot org which consist of Craig Newmark foundation, which is a five o one c three and I have a couple of donor advised funds. There's also the craigslist charitable fund. The idea is that I figure, um, I could see what's going on in the world today and I can identify some areas where help is needed and uh, you know, where I can help other people, I can find smart people who are doing things that make a difference and support them with media, with cash, with convening power. Uh, the deal is that I screwed up really badly with craigslist in the sense that I haven't, I never told people back in 2000 and not now that I'm not in craigslist management and I've had real no real role to play in any decision making since 2000 stupid of me.

Speaker 2:          20:59          And I learned how stupid that was around 2010. So since then, I've now gotten communications and PR religion. I'm a zealot that matters for technical people because every one of us, how about us? Our own image, our own brand, our own narrative. And no one is going to really watch out for your own narrative. That's something as tech people we're all responsible for. But I figured that out in 2010 God, professional help and the right now I need a great deal of professional help and I have it. I got an email from some of the folks right before coming up here, literally. So that's a big, big lesson. But in a way, with the help of professional communicators, I've identified four areas where I'm helping people. There's a veterans and their families because I figure if someone's willing to maybe go to another country and risk taking ability protecting me, I should do something.

Speaker 2:          22:03          And it never occurred to me until I was told that their families give up and sacrifice a lot for them. So for example, I started off today working with the Bob Woodruff Foundation. They find they qualify and vet and fund organizations which support wounded veterans, wounded veterans and their families and their caregivers. So this is a really good setup. We got going and literally that was nine o'clock this morning that I met with him. Um, another area in the interest of practicing what you preach and treating people like you want to be treated. I have a women in tech effort, which I'm still developing. Uh, I've been involved for years with the women's startup challenge, which is a deal where, um, startups run by women pitch to a panel of vcs winning valuable cash prizes and winning valuable time with vcs cause still usually hang around and help you network and give you advice.

Speaker 2:          23:06          So that's a big deal, um, in this year or two. But if you want to protect the country, um, voting rights, the voting rights of lots of people in this country are under attack. We knew they were under attack by bad politicians for some years because sometimes the politicians will admit it sometimes in a row, a week or so ago in a document produced by Robert Muller in part 47, he says that one thing the Russians were doing was interfering with, uh, people actually voting. They were going after people who might vote democratic and that may have tilted things in some states. Notice I'm not making a political statement there. I'm talking about protecting the country, so the deal is that I'm doing what I can to protect voting rights that's still developing because I'm only now talking to the people doing it. Most of all though I have a program involved with trustworthy journalism and I'm supporting a number of groups that are trying to do good work.

Speaker 2:          24:16          Like I'm working with the Google newspeople to support the trust project out of Santa Clara University. Speaking as a news consumer, I just want news I can trust the trust project is one way of articulating what a news outlet has to do to provide trustworthy news. Things like don't lie to people. Things like when you do make a mistake, fix it. Things like listen to different kinds of people so you get different perspectives. There's other things involved to Poynter institute runs the international fact checking network because of a news outlet commits to trustworthy journalism. They should, you know, you need watchdogs to make sure that they're doing it. But as of a year ago, one guy who actually has been here and who talks with the Google newspaper a lot, and also Facebook guy named Jeff Jarvis a year ago told me for fun to read the NATO handbook on Russian information warfare in that Russian military and military intelligence particular tell us, tell the world what they're gonna do to the u s during the election.

Speaker 2:          25:27          Uh, and uh, last week I think Canadian intelligence among others says, hey, here's what the Russians did in 2016 and continue to do now get growing up in the 50s, I saw a lot of crackpot activity regarding communists and Russians. And so I'm a very gun shy in this regards, but, um, the intelligence community and, uh, you know, the people investigating fake news, the people who are looking at networks of it say a lot of, there's a lot of domestic bad actors amplifying what the Russians are doing for really bad results, including a lot of harassment. This is real stuff. And I figure if I want to help defend the country, I need to find people, do find people doing good work. I need to get them communication support and I need to fund them. And honestly, I'm now writing large checks to support these groups because, uh, they are defending the country just like active service members and veterans and their families help defend the country.

Speaker 2:          26:40          Similarly, I think Wikipedia plays a big role in this because my slogan about Wikipedia is that Wikipedia is where facts go to live. So I'm involved in helping fund their counter arrestment effort. I'm talking to them about, uh, what's the nature of reliable sources. And, uh, I'm also working with him on the bio's of living persons because it's just really hard to get those bios fixed. I had a college professor, uh, fixed mine up for the most part, but I've been into some events recently where when I talk about Wikipedia, frankly I get a lot of crap from notable people who have Vyos, who have no way of fixing them. So those are the kinds of things. I'm a working with Wikipedia. I am a PR one of the funders of Wiki Tribune. Uh, but that's not a Wikipedia thing. Although oddly last week in Miami at a conference, I saw Jimmy plus a or reach who are the cofounders of Reiki Tribune.

Speaker 2:          27:45          So the deal here is on the craigslist side, a business model of doing well by doing good with a lot of luck can do pretty well. And I feel I, uh, well if you may, if you're lucky enough to do well, you should help the next people do well and you should practice what you preach, which includes, um, treating people like he wanted to be treated. I can go on quite a long time, but I'm going to stop there. Thank you very much. Um, I think you've mentioned that in 2011 that you started to come to crack next and in 2015 you decided to launch the crack. You Mark Foundation, even based on the name, I think are quite different approaches behind dad's message. Right? So, uh, you're making a correct inference regarding the names. It just, it didn't work out that way. Um, I remember 2011 I wanted to have a brand that would be catchy and effective.

Speaker 2:          28:55          The best we could think of a cracker next just failed because no one knows what Craig is. Craig Newmark foundation or Craig Newmark philanthropies. People know what that is. And interestingly, I hear rumors that people in New York may know more about who Craig Newmark is. Then in the bay area, the advantage there is that New York is the country's hub of news, media and influence and connection. This isn't it. And what I want to do are things that contribute as I pushed my efforts, I want to contribute towards a new normal of trustworthy news and that means things that I do have to be noticed to be effective. I think we are

Speaker 1:          29:42          in about, it's about, we have about 20 minutes left and then we can um, have some questions that was from the dory. And also you're more than welcome to use that mic for, uh, for life questions says, well, I can ask a question that was from Googlers RSVP. One of them is, uh, I haven't been using CEO at least for at least 10 years and cannot pass it up the moment to thank you for making a huge impact to every day Americans like myself. The question is what inspire you to be able to crack list in the first place? Uh,

Speaker 2:          30:18          it literally is just the, uh, the sense that I should give back because on the well and using it newsgroups even back in the early nineties, I was told the craziness, there were still a lot of people who would help each other out, sometimes contributing expensive consulting time. There were a couple of dramatic cases on the, well, we're a doctor, help save people. So that's it. The idea is that I'm getting such good stuff from this community I should give back. And it felt right,

Speaker 1:          30:53          but why was it very difficult to get? Because at the time there was not much of that services, right? Uh, even 250 of the subscribers at the time who were appropriate, but using maybe phone lines and modems to dial. Right. If you think about that has quite difficult. What, what's the, uh, the biggest challenge in the early earliest days? Yeah,

Speaker 2:          31:16          I think I started by the way, with the 9,696 scoreboard modem or 9.6 kilowatt modem and I remember when 56 was a big deal. Um, but uh, can you repeat that again?

Speaker 1:          31:33          What was your biggest challenge in the earliest days

Speaker 2:          31:36          challenge in terms of growing? Well, the good part was I wasn't thinking about growing things grew word of mouth. If someone at a company was getting the mailings, they would share it with other people in the same company and then that person would send me an email saying, put me on the email list. That worked pretty well. Something that helped accelerate this was that this was a 95 when the Dotcom boom was just hitting San Francisco. And uh, that accelerated things, a phenomenon back there. I've got like lots of launch parties, some open, some closed. Uh, Patty Baran did something called SF girl. Her specialty was finding launch parties and telling people how to get into them even if they were closed. My only distinct memory from that time was that the, uh, new at that time, San Francisco Museum of Modern Art in the entry, they had lots of food and they were a big mounds of fresh shrimp. And that was my favorite memory of that, uh, of that era. It was people were spending way too much money on this kind of thing. You know, if you watch HBO, Silicon Valley, you'll see a lot of the, uh, that history being recapitulated. Okay.

Speaker 2:          33:00          Oh, take one, a live question. Thank you for joining us today. Um, there's so many,

Speaker 3:          33:05          Geez, globally. Um, do you have things like, Fred, this is a great for you moved to the city and I need a free coach. And for the most people that done one already, is there other things like, uh, that you're looking at advice, um,

Speaker 4:          33:22          Aye

Speaker 2:          33:23          and frustrated in that I'm not smart enough to think of really good things to do. What I have done at, partly through a charity called in Venio in this, in San Francisco, is to help get refugee centers and so on and related efforts wired up for the Internet because the aid workers say that they need internet connectivity for various purposes. For example, in that we did that in a Haiti that is, I helped by funding in Haiti. Uh, and just yesterday I was reminded that I helped get wired up the, the dob, um, refugee camp, which may be the largest in the world and I think it's in northern Africa someplace. I'd forgotten all about it until I saw a reference because of the keyword search in Google news yesterday and again, literally yesterday. Um, there's been all other ones too when the Obama administration was trying a serious outreach to the Islamic world, I helped wire up the vocational schools in the West Bank.

Speaker 2:          34:28          Now we have something going on a island in Lake Victoria. We are there, we're helping provide internet conductivity. But there it's because people need it, but it's also a lure into a facility to get people tested, tested for HIV because culturally speaking, it's really hard to get people to get tested, but they all want to be on the net. So those are small things. Nowadays I'm thinking I'm specializing because in our country maybe we have an all hands on deck situation where things have gotten bad and we need to do something good like protecting the vote, like a stopping a bad actors, Russians or otherwise from contaminating the news because you really can't run a democracy if the normal national conversation has a lot of lying going on.

Speaker 4:          35:25          Thank you. Thank you.

Speaker 2:          35:29          And we have another question from Dory.

Speaker 4:          35:31          Uh,

Speaker 2:          35:34          I think this is related to orient to related to, um, the involvement of, uh, of the, of the management. But the question is, I can think of many ways the crack glass can improve and wondering what's the roadmap and why does crack less seems reluctant to take it to the next level. Um, well for any of that since I'm not involved in management, email something to jim@craigslist.org. Don't send any intellectual property and uh, hopefully you've gotten the lecture about protecting that if not hear from the folks on Hbo, Silicon Valley. Um, so please do that. Bear in mind, that's what people seem to need is not fancy stuff but effective stuff. Fast and simple is always big regarding the next level. I don't know what the next level is, but if you're helping people put food on the table, that's pretty good. Next level to me.

Speaker 2:          36:33          Right. I asked me actually think of a followup question on that. Like, um, in terms of funding in from the funder Craiglist uh, you have been very conservative in turning down and turned out a lot of investment ask. Right? Uh, and have you ever wondering that with more resource like money, that quick list would be able to have more resources in fighting like scams and spams. And this also really applies to not just craigslist but also maybe we compete here and when, and maybe the of the overall news community, maybe, uh, what we need is a crush project to Manhattan project in terms of the software which can figure out that intent on the part of a posting of any sort. A posting could be an ad or a comment. Um, that would be really, really smart software. I don't think it exists and I don't think it's going to exist anytime soon.

Speaker 2:          37:41          Maybe I should, uh, offer a really big price for that. And maybe that would be a, maybe that would be a useful since I don't think it exists. Yeah. But we do, uh, we do needs that, that kind of thing. Um, there are, again, those are those people who think software that smart, uh, could achieve self awareness and you know, you hope it's the nice kind of self awareness. Like the like the AI is that we in banks culture novels and not the murderous pistol wielding robots of Westworld. Although that is a really good show. Thank you. We have another light questions.

Speaker 5:          38:24          I thank you for being here and sharing our story and you appreciate it. You seem like a really humble person, but I last us anyways. When you look back, what is the biggest you think you did and what did you learn from it?

Speaker 2:          38:37          Our big, well, the big mistake as a company was not seizing control and determining our own narrative. When you're not telling your own story, other people can tell it and most of them will be good, some are bad, some of them will be running scams of one sort or another. That's why on a, yeah, in 2010 I started doing it for myself and I've stumbled along the way, but now I have a really good from helping me out. The thing is that you do need good smart people doing that. I like Marc Benioff at salesforce does a great job of it. There are other dotcoms who've done a terrible job of it. Even when people like me are trying to help them and to try to do a little wake up call

Speaker 1:          39:25          free to ask a live question.

Speaker 5:          39:30          Um, I was wondering if you had any advice in general around creating the Internet, why communities? Like how would you handle that scale of people or what advice you'd give to companies or startups or nonprofits trying to create Internet scale? Uh,

Speaker 2:          39:45          I don't have broad overall, uh, oh, a advice just to watch out that user generated content. We'll have a moderation problem and there was a number of unsolved problems with it. Yeah. And right now that's in major flux right now, somewhere in the alphabet. There's a jigsaw, I think that's Jared a Cohen. I keep forgetting his last name. Working directly with Eric Schmidt. They think they have a handle on the problem. I don't know. But uh, that's something which is badly needed. There are folks who are doing a big work with machine learning here and that may, that may lead the path. But again, uh, um, no one knows how were machine learning is going to lead us and I am kind of excited about it. But remember, I've been reading science fiction for over 50 years.

Speaker 1:          40:45          How about I put the question on the other way. Uh, so you had been a nerd and the, the credit list is actually a very successful community, right? If we want to learn from how to create a white can come internet community, what are things that were not coding or technical but the things that you've done, what are the practices and strategy in the early days that you think is part of the success of this creating this community?

Speaker 2:          41:13          Um, the success factor is doing one's best to provide a customer service that's serious. Again, the challenge when you're saying it's mostly free, um, that was the big thing right there because the initial spirit that this site was about giving people a break, uh, and people see that by accident, that proved to be a good start, a good initial culture or where as people like to say it's in our DNA and that's managed to succeed.

Speaker 2:          41:47          Is there any challenge to work with volunteers with volunteers in the early ages? Oh, thank you. You mentioned a lot of them are volunteers in that first year as a volunteer thing failed because you can't, uh, you can't tell a volunteer to like, do you think you just can't tell them that their job depends on getting something done at a certain time? Because if they're volunteers, you can't withdraw their pay. So companies, I guess the company in human history is quite an invention to make things work that otherwise I wouldn't work. So, uh, you normally don't think of it as an invention, but it is and he is that and it is an invention of the way how people can collaborate. Right. Yeah. Yeah. That's taken nother, uh, life questions.

Speaker 6:          42:37          Thanks for coming here. Um, again, very, uh, interested in, in your story and that was really good to hear from you. Um, my, I guess my question is, you know, you mentioned that people come to you and to say, do you have advice for creating the craigslist? Oh Huh. Um, I do find the fundamental principle of Craig's list as a, as a product very interesting, which is connecting people who need things with connecting people who want things in a single place of exchange, right? In a very fundamental level. Like maybe airbnb is even trying to do that, which is, you know, I have some leftover things and if some people can pay me for some of these things, I'm curious to know for all the ones that you heard, can I create a Craig list of whatever? What are the, some of the most interesting things? What are some of the most successful things or even weirder?

Speaker 2:          43:26          Uh, I don't pay much attention to the people who make businesses out of that because I, yeah, I guess I just don't care. I mean, that's a distraction. The best kind of things, uh, where people manage to make it a little business out of finding junk stuff and then rebuilding it and making it into something real. And until today, I couldn't think of a good example, except again, I just gave a, I was on a panel at Sanford business school are a kid who must've been 20, but look 14 to me, but he made a business out of going to the junk yards in his neighborhood. Um, finding old bikes, uh, rebuilding them and selling them. And that, uh, was a way that he saved up enough for whatever he needed. Maybe a little bit for a college or something like that. That feels really good.

Speaker 2:          44:21          And there's been other things too because during the recession, around 2008, 2009, I could see a lot of people who really were lying on a, our site for advertising. They were relying on it for barter because sometimes that's the only way you're going to get what you need in a recession. And a, that lasted a couple of years I think. So we have all these, uh, things happen that does feel pretty good. But meanwhile, in these philanthropic areas I have, we have real challenges. Um, again on Craig Newmark, freelance reason.org. That's how I'm a Ho. That's sound getting this, uh, uh, this stuff done the best I can. I should mention that I'm not restricting myself completely to those sick, those four areas. I'm working with some groups on food security, like a meals on wheels kinds of things, delivering hot food to people or whatever. Like in New York in particular, I support God's love we deliver, which when you say it fast is God's lovely liver. Um, and I also support a pigeon rescue because I know how important that is to everyone. I've also learned there that pigeon pants is a thing and that you want the pigeon to be wearing the pants before they fly onto your shoulder. Two cool. Lovingly at you. If they do first and then the pants are put on, you may have a problem. And I did, although I do like pigeons a lot.

Speaker 2:          46:02          We have some question from the dory again, I think the live streaming people are now sending the questions. One question is a Craiglist has notoriously not modernized. It's a design and Ux. What's the reasoning afford this? Well, I can't speak for the whole company, but if you look at the site, we've been incrementally making improvements in it, uh, for years. Both improvements that you can see like the database, like the thumbnail sketches and all that and the people who use the site say this is what they want. So we've made a lot of improvements that way. There's a lot of improvements that you can't see, like improved caching and efforts to keep the site fast. Speed is a design principle and it's a really important design principle. And yeah, Google does a lot of things along those lines. Like something I have to look into is a better use of a Google domain, a service.

Speaker 2:          47:03          Because I have my real doubts regarding both my ISP that all three of my ISP because something tells me their DNS look ups are a kind of sluggish. I should also count the hotel I usually stay at in New York because their ISP kind of, uh, fails to deliver. But I'm hoping not to be in there much longer. You, uh, I have a question that daddy is the integration of a blockchain. The questions says, I'm personally really, uh, appreciate Wikipedia and crack and list as the three layers of knowledge and marketing information in the economy. Have you considered blockchain integration in which you could create pure decentralized Craiglist and token nomics around it, but what's your view in general on that and how can people can collaborate? So a blockchain is applied to the craigslist. I just saw mill, which was working on, what I'm thinking is that blockchain based identity verified identity might be a way that we can get a lot more accountability on the net.

Speaker 2:          48:08          And like when you get a scam sent to you or a piece of spam, you'd like to hold the center a carnival to that, that's good. But on the net, we're always going to need places where you can be completely anonymous, places for dissidents, whistleblowers, uh, people who may be in a really bad domestic abuse situation. We're always going to need places where verified identity is not good. We're in anonymity is good. Uh, this may also apply, and this is a big thing. The European Union now has this GDPR standard. Uh, it's, uh, a set of standards which allow consumers to control the data passed between publishers and advertisers. And, uh, my gut, my gut feeling is that blockchain based to control of an individual's data will be away to make everyone happy in terms of the data about a consumer that a advertiser and publisher can chair.

Speaker 2:          49:14          Cause I don't know about you, but I want control of that, that kind of data. And I do want to be served ads, which actually means something to me. You know, sometimes it's mixed because my wife and they are shit. My wife and I share an Amazon account, especially when she's buying things for the nephews and nieces and we've got 21 of them. So odd things up in my, uh, in my Amazon profile. That's okay. But I want the ability to control that blockchain may be the way to do that. And do you think it also may help in turn and stuff that say, um, uh, the chew news and uh, uh, fighting the fake news thing, for example? I don't know honestly what role they play in that. That's something that people smarter than me are working on. Um, my gut tells me that, uh, like one of the biggest things that need to happen are the fact checkers.

Speaker 2:          50:13          Uh, I like at the international fact checking network and the tech and check people let Duke they like if you, if fact checking in real time is really hard because if someone lies to the, um, and the newspapers and so on and report it, you know, it, they may only realized that it's a lie an hour after. So we're talking about summary fact checking, meaning that a person or a news outlet will have a track record in terms of how honest they are not. And I think that's going to need a lot of, uh, that's gonna need a lot of work because frankly, um, it's not hard to figure out what news outlets try to get things right and which news outlets deliberately get things wrong. The idea is how do you do it so that no one is an arbiter of truth is no one, no single group or anything.

Speaker 2:          51:09          We'll arbitrary truth. Instead you have a large network of networks and that's what's happening right now. Maybe not fast enough. And I, uh, just realize another condition I made put on if I may make, and I'm going to make a very large grant to a particular news, uh, institution because, you know, I'm talking about journalism, but I'm a news consumer and I've learned a lot. But unless you've been writing to get to deadline like five times a week, you don't know journalism because that's really a tough kind of creative pressure. You know, I've, I've been in situations where I've had to write code to deadline, but writing stories that deadline is tougher because you don't know what the story is at a time. Whereas if you're coding, you normally know what kind of stuff you got to write. Presumably someone's done some decent requirements, definition of the variety, which is not entirely stupid.

Speaker 2:          52:11          I put that qualification on, uh, just reminding people that I worked in IBM development for six years. Not that I have anything specific in mind. Okay. One of the last question. Uh, we saw the startup train of pursuing vertical opportunities of Wa cracking list is doing for the past decade as a horizontal company. I'm wondering what crack list think of this trend and how crack when we respond to this trend of the future? Uh, I don't think about it much because I'm focused on philanthropy. Uh, Jim may be thinking about it, but you'd have to ask him, which is not a satisfactory answer. But again, the deal is that, and may it's may be a good thing that like for roughly 10 years, um, I focused well for, for 10 years I focused on coding, then customer service. Then for a lot of that I focused on customer service and then philanthropy.

Speaker 2:          53:13          Not that I'm a really, really smart in any of that, but I'm combining the two. I mean, I've been lucky enough to do well and I'm putting my money where my mouth is in all this. The deal is that, uh, you know, there's this billionaire's pledge to give away half of what you've made during your lifetime. I have a friend, I'm not being specific, but I've already exceeded that. I'm, uh, looking to do more to do it in smart ways because a, a democracy cannot survive built on lies and you know, we need to fix that and we have some runway to fix that until things go really bad. So I'm involved in that kind of thing. And by but involved, I mean, I'm involved in it literally every day and uh, you know, that ain't so bad. Again, there's a lot of people around who are smarter than me and who do more than me. My role is to, uh, bring them together and to get some cash to him. Not Bad.

Speaker 1:          54:16          Thank you.
