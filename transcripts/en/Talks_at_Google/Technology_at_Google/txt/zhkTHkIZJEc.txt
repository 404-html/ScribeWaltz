Speaker 1:          00:06          [inaudible]

Speaker 2:          00:10          well, thank you everyone for coming. It's a really special privilege and honor for me actually to talk to Gary, in my opinion, my humble opinion, the greatest chess player of all time. And um, you know, I've really enjoyed his book, which a I reviewed recently and um, in know of, is impressed with Gary's understanding of artificial intelligence and a, the latest advances in that. So, you know, it's going to be great to talk about that as well as chest today.

Speaker 3:          00:38          Thank your Marketo demarche you'll review it over would be all of the protection against all the tech guys that tried to was this has to be for not being an expert.

Speaker 2:          00:47          Well, I'm glad if that can be of use. So, um, before we get talking about, uh, you know, um, blue match and now she'll, everyone's going to want to hear about your insights on that and also machine learning more generally. And I wanted to begin by asking you about growing up as a chess champion in Soviet Union. Um, did you always want to be a chess player, a world champion of chess? Did you consider anything else or were you from a very young age decided that this was your path?

Speaker 3:          01:13          Um, I learned how to play chess when I was five, four, six. I'm sorry I couldn't give you an exact moment. Nobody was there to tweet about it was late 68 [inaudible] 69. Yeah. Watching my parents trying to solve chess problem. And, um, I love the game of foresight and, um, ever since I'm still an old was the game and uh, um, I, I could feel that was a match made in heaven and everybody around also could see that a chess was a perfect feet for, for my mind

Speaker 2:          01:48          skills. Yeah. Yeah. And actually you talk about in the book about chess, informing all of your thinking and the rest of your life, right? Do you, what do you mean by that? What skills can you see yourself using in the rest of your life that you love? Yes.

Speaker 3:          02:02          Naturally, if you will engaged in, in, in a competitive sport at such an early age, uh, you, you, you, you see many things just, uh, uh, uh, as a reflection of, of your chess games, your engagement because you have to play up to win. It means you have to change certain, um, certain habits and certain customers. Um, and, uh, um, uh, what was important for me, that's what I learned from my mother is, is it's, my game was not just about winning. It was also about making a difference. And that's what helped me to make a transition later on in my life, uh, from a, um, playing chess being number one chess player for 20 years to other things that I'm doing now. Not pretending that I could be number one and repeat my outstanding achievements in the game of chess, but still recognizing that I'm quite useful because I'm trying to, uh, um, um, uh, bring my chest experience, my, what I learned from the game of Chess, uh, my analytical skills to make the difference elsewhere.

Speaker 2:          03:04          Sarabia. Oh yeah. We should, we should talk about a, obviously the heart of your book, which is that the deeply batch and you know, I was fascinated to see your, your take on, you know, having gone through the Alpha go matches ourselves on the other side. Your take on it from, from the player's perspective.

Speaker 3:          03:20          It's a, it's a, it's an interesting story because when we played our first match and I always want to remind people that the two matches and I want the first one. Exactly. We should, we should make that very clear. So exactly. The first match in Philadelphia, uh, it just, it was organized as quite a low level event. Uh, the corporation was not even involved. Uh, it was, uh, ECM behind it and the team always wanted to challenge me and I had an experience of playing was our plating is there, I mean, 1989 when they had a deep thought, uh, the prototype from Carnegie Mellon that they brought to IBM and it's turned into a deep blue project. Um, and um, everything has changed up the game. One, which by the way, if we are talking about a watershed moment, that was in February 90 96 in Philadelphia when I lost game one of that match because the rest is, you may argue, matter of technique, matter of time it was like signing on the wall.

Speaker 3:          04:19          If the machine could be the world champion in one game, then eventually, eventually, yeah, I fought back, I won the match. I want to get into and gain 500, game six. But it was pretty clear that the rest will be measure of time. Um, and the first game, uh, had some kind of record following on the Internet. I think it's, they did the numbers they had, they will hide the numbers later on in Atlanta that IBM run, uh, around, uh, um, uh, the, the website there. And suddenly the corporation, a Google Sre, these team discovered the huge potential at other relatively low cost. So, um, and uh, while the rest of the match was still, you know, play to, it's just what, who chest, then it turned into a big corporate endeavor. And, um, and I'm, look, it's water under the bridge. 20 years ago I lost the match, but I think, and I discovered the book, I made many mistakes in preparation and one of the biggest mistake, and it's quite, you know, that's why I was so upset with myself, is that I didn't treat the IBM deep blue as just an appalling, the way you're treated Anatoly Karpov where Vishy Anand or not too short for me, it was a still, um, in this, I was still part of, of a great social and scientific experiment of the end of the 20th century.

Speaker 3:          05:37          So I'm seeing that could help us to understand more about how we humans make decisions, how machines can play with us. It's, it was not just, you know, winning or losing big mistake. Yeah. Uh, uh, now for IBM would was just about winning or losing care. Yeah. And, uh, the, one of, one of the big mistakes that I made as just as I, while signing the contract, um, you always have to read the fine print. Yeah. I hate them because it's, it's when people ask me what the IBM cheated. No, they just bend the rules in their favor. At states they followed the, the letter, but of the spirit of the agreement and for instance, one of the big issues, uh, after, uh, after our first machine for they'll fit for me it was how can I prepare if I didn't have any games, this is the normal way to prepare and look at the game.

Speaker 3:          06:25          So your opponent and the deep blue in Philadelphia was a black box. I had no idea what it was capable of. There were soft, I saw few games at machine played in, in other against other computers, but it was not, it was not the machine that I faced me now one year more than one year, 15 months between the first match and the second match. And, um, and that was under the impression that it's, it's, it will be, I will be treated fairly because after my first victory, Philadelphia, I went to Yorktown Heights, I said was their team, they had this, this, you know, similar arrangements for all IBM labs around the world. So the atmosphere was very friendly and they change and, and then it just, it's the, when I eat nodes as I expected them games to be provided. And then they said, wait a second, but can you read the games played in official tournament's and of course the blue hasn't played a single game outside the lab.

Speaker 3:          07:16          So which means that in, in, in Maine 98, in May, 1997, I face them face another black box that I knew was much stronger than it's, it's um, um, it, it was before but still no idea what, what to expect. I knew they had a professional team, so they, they made a massive preparation. And I have to also admit my probation was quite lousy because again, I only just before the match and we did before the match and realized, you know, that's how difficult the challenge could be. But also the, one of the, one of the key elements of the, of, of, of, um, of this contract that I told the overlooked was about, um, machines rebooting. Hmm. That's a big issue. Yeah. You understand what it is. It's here. I don't have to explain, but general audience doesn't understand that the moment you work with the computer, you will never be able to reconstruct the game.

Speaker 3:          08:02          So which means that is a whole idea that it's the Ma Mat matches fair and square and, and, and you can always go back and to see why the blue made this move or that move. It's all over. And also they're making, maybe people don't realize that actually I didn't meet, as I said, read the book. They're in fact several times there they're rebooting crashed and then we don't know. And then they came up with a different move, right. In a couple of seconds. It's not, it doesn't matter what the move was, is just the crash. You know, it's in, if you played a match, anything but the, but the problems was agreed. Crush. You lost the game. Heart attack. Sorry, go to synagogue.

Speaker 3:          08:39          Yeah, no, but it's the, it had Ken Thompson. Oh, that's the great condemned or expert. Just, you know, just who was there in Philadelphia helping me. He was also in front of the screen, but on the screen you could see the deep blues communication back to the programmer, but you didn't see what have they said anything. By the way, the, the other way, again, I don't know, but it's, it's definitely created a lot of tension in the match and, uh, and we now have to losing game, uh, game to its essence and how the story of its own. So I was very upset and I demanded a logs. And by the way, if they wanted to play a fair, um, a fair game, all the head to do is a produced the blog, the blogs. And to prove that my suspicions were not well founded, they didn't do it.

Speaker 3:          09:23          They just wanted me just to, to, uh, to be inflamed because they realize that while the blue was not that strong at that time, I still think I was stronger objective. And now 20 years later, you can look at the games. You know, you can take, uh, a chess engine on your laptop and you'll find out that many mistakes were made from both sides. I mean one of the, one of the most amazing, it was not get given game too, but game five, the end game reach an end game. I was slightly better. And everybody at that time in 1997, I believe that was a brilliant escape by the blue. Now in 30 seconds to one minute depends on the strengths of your, uh, of, of the, the speed of your computer chess engines like stock, fish or comma will tell you that the end game was a draw.

Speaker 3:          10:03          The blue made a bad mistake. And I, and then I missed the win, which nobody saw in 1997. It's an including including the blue. So that tells you that stay there, all of the strings. And I think that's, if we played it, this should match the rubber match. I still had a good chance of winning. Again, it wouldn't change the sort, the long term outcome, but at very thing you could have held them off for if I hit a full potential maybe two, three years. As far as the Blue Maxim to yeah, I played two more matches with, uh, with, uh, uh, deep roots and, and, and, and, um, the junior in 2003 boats ended in a draw. So that was a balance in the next five years. But in 1997, they realized that it putting pressure on only one human player in a match, they could, they could achieve the result. If you cannot make your play a stronger, you can definitely, you know, um, uh, um, in Mclean, the other player and, and, and, and took him off the ballot.

Speaker 2:          10:51          So, so what I'm saying sort of moving more to the present day now and you know, how'd you, do you think, how have chess computers change chest? Do you think it's for the better? It's just different. What, what, what do you think about that, that evolution,

Speaker 3:          11:04          this something that you said that you know, it just, it's, it's quite striking because you said, is it for better or worse it's happening. Yeah. Period is, as the technology is not neither good nor bad. It's agnostic. It, you know, you can do many great things too. Is with, with your mobile phone, but you can also create a terrorist networks. So it's this, it's, it's happening and we just have to adjust. And, uh, as for the game of chess, uh, it's different because young generational chess players, they learn very differently from us. I remember I had books and not so many books. You can use new books, you can, you can buy in the Soviet Union. Every book was cherished. And I had my, um, my notebooks. So this is, and I, when I, when I, when I went to, to the top and played world championship matches, I had to also note books and just all my recording my analysis and I treasure them.

Speaker 3:          11:52          I remember just, you know, had couple of, couple of, quite a thick notebooks. We was analysis and they were, you know, just top secret. And I believed in eight, 1985 in 1986, 1987. That was real pressure. That was a powerful weapon. It's like, you know, the Magic Sword of Maryland. Now when you look at this analysis was computer. You understand what's broken knife. Um, but also when you look at, at young young chess players and, um, under the umbrella of crossbar off just foundation, I've been involved in working with them and I'm talking about Kate's off international masters, grand master level. Um, it's, it's such a different in the way they approach the game, the way they look at the pieces. It's, it's, it happened time and again, we are reaching certain position, analyzing the game and they say, bad move. I made a mistake here.

Speaker 3:          12:45          It's a fine why? Oh, and then it's a long line. So the machine showed, I said, I understand, I could see the screen, but why you think this move was wrong? And they don't understand the question because machine said so because it's on the screen. So it's, it's somehow they are be the minds being hijacked by, by the power of the machine. And one of the reasons Magnus Carlsen was so successful and still a dominant force in a wall of chess. And I remember soon after working with him in 2009, 2010 for more than a year, um, he never looked at the machine as an ultimate source of wisdom for a much more, was more like a calculator to, to verify his own understanding and evaluation of the position. This is a big challenge, but I believe it's not only in chess, it's elsewhere, uh, many people just staring at the computers as ice or just being, you know, being caught by, by the screen, expecting just to find the solution. They're just, you know, instead of thinking for themselves. So that's why I always bring Kiddo, as, as, as an, as a piece of wisdom, the classical phrase from public ucast so the computers are useless because they can only give you answers. Yeah. So, but everything begins with a question

Speaker 2:          13:57          [inaudible] essentially until about Magnus Carlsen you say that he, interestingly, although he's grown up in the computer chess area, he's one of the most human, I think you called it, or intuitive players around. Right. So it's kind of interesting. He's consistent.

Speaker 3:          14:09          Um, it's, um, it, yes, it's human because at the end of the day, 20 years after my match was the blue, more people playing chess than ever before and the chest is still very popular because at the end of the day it's, it's a, it's a fight between two individuals and, uh, um, what has changed is not a, it's not just the game itself, but the way people are watching it. 20 years ago or 30 years ago, 40 years ago, the world championship match was kind of in out in the streets in event of absolute quality. Even Karpov and Kasparov play the game and one made a terrible blunder. It could take time in the press center for Grand Masters to find out to, to, to whisper it mistake. And uh, it's, it's, it's like, you know, this is, it's something that you could use warship today. You know, I, I, when I'm watching what I'm watching the games, but Magnus Carlsen Corona and you have thousands of amateurs from all over the world watching it, you can, this scribbling an staying was techniques, machine shows immediately that says evaluation drop. So it's some kind of respect has disappeared from, from that sense it's a real shame but also, but also it, it added interest because people can follow. They just, you a this days they, they give access to their computer and they don't have to, they don't have to be strong players to understand what is, what is happening. And uh, um,

Speaker 2:          15:30          what an interesting thing you said actually about the chess computers. And I wonder if it's going to happen with Kara as well in the countries that are not traditionally did at chess or go because they have access to these machines. Maybe kids in those countries can now get very strong, right? Like magnus in no way or I don't know whether that's, you know,

Speaker 3:          15:46          madness. It's a, it's a rise. Meteoric rise was due to computers and maybe it's because you are you in, in, in, in, in, uh, in this environment. You don't have to spend so much time learning from other players. So, um, the, the process of, of, of maturing for the chess player is much shorter. You have a grand masters at 14, 15 today. They know much water. Bob Official knew 40 years ago. Uh, just because they played many games, they could travel around and they could watch the games. So chess, chess is a perfect match for four Internet because you can follow the games, you can learn, you can analyze. So the many things you can do that at a dramatically increased the pace of, of, of learning and getting to the top.

Speaker 2:          16:29          So you, you invented I think the concept of advanced chess, right? Matt Mann and computer, human and computer issue and cares, human and computer versus computer. Are you still stronger? Have you tried that recently with the later chess engines? Are you, is that still true now?

Speaker 3:          16:43          Oh, um, yes. Um, yeah. Why licking my wounds after the blue match. So I sorta how about bring you together just out of curiosity, because as a way to segregate, if I just can play with who is a machine just against another player. So maybe we can play perfect chest. Now, the interesting thing is when we played these match was Veselin Topalov in other, in other top player. Uh, in 99, he ate, I can tell you the quality was not very high because it was limited amount of time and it was so new for us how to use the machine. It's end. Eventually I realized and we had many events, the so called freestyle events on the Internet that proved that it sounds quite ironic, but you don't need a very strong player to get the best result of human plus machine combination. It could sound like a Harris in now, but it's, I would say that you don't, you don't want a strong player.

Speaker 3:          17:37          It's, you need a good operator and decent player. But someone who will follow the machine, I should guide the machine but not will you use the machine to back up his or her own ideas because instinctively if I came up was a computer, I'll try to sue. I'll try to make my own moves. Yeah, you don't have to. All you need is just to maximize the effect of machines play because machines are so strong now. All we need, all your you have to do is just to, to guide them. Sometimes you can feel no, just, you know, slight correction, move here, move there. So it's, it's, it's something that requires a very different kind of qualities. It's more about interface. So you don't need a great knowledge of the game, my weight, it may help, but it's to the other side. It may preclude you from a sort of using machines power because you try to play your own game, which could be detrimental.

Speaker 2:          18:30          So it's, it's something that's, um, you know, I think you touched on in a few places that it's become known as Casper off law. Now write something like this with the processes, right?

Speaker 3:          18:38          Oh, do you, and explain what that is and again, and again, I just, I, I relied on results of the, of the freestyle tournaments and what's happened is there that as predicted, uh, uh, a human plus machine, uh, beat super computer quite handily. Uh, but the most unexpected story was that it starts as a described, um, a relatively weak human or a group of humans plus machine or machines. If the class plus better a better process, they of course they beat a supercomputer, would know more. Remarkably, they beat a strong human plus machine plus in fury process. So that's led me to come to the conclusion that it's all about interface. This is so many, um, ways of, of, of um, empowering machines was our creativity. So not our creativity was machines brute force of calculation. Actually you do it other way around and then the result is, is it could, it could be phenomenal. Mm.

Speaker 2:          19:32          So it strikes me in the whole book, you're very optimistic about technology in general, Ricky. Now in terms of like what it might be able to do, what, what is this a kind of process? Is that a kind of blueprint for, you know, in advanced chess of how you see things going forward in other areas of life with machines and humans working together in a complementary way? Oh, uh,

Speaker 3:          19:51          I believe, uh, the future is a self fulfilling prophecy and um, I cannot stand all these, uh, you know, doom and gloom predictions. Um, it's, it was quite amazing when you just look at ad the ad change of the trend in science fiction from 50s and 60s, where is all about optimism? US [inaudible] was computers, Robert's cyborgs flying to do other, not just to other planners but to other star systems. And then it's, it changed to a very dystopian vision of the terminator. Uh, and the, um, uh, the metrics, by the way, there's a speaking about the terminator, you know, I just, it's, I, I just recently, I just got an idea, just having a lecture in, in, in Dallas, Texas, earliest spawns. I looked at the terminator, I said, you know what guys? I can tell you that that's another proof of what you call [inaudible] law because we're all watched the first one, human versus machine.

Speaker 3:          20:51          But if you follow the number two or number three, that was exactly what I said. Human plus machine was a better process of it being a super computer. So it's the, yeah, and, and I think it's this, it's this, what we'll learn from chess is that there are many ways of us, of us sort of getting, getting some, something new, something positive out of those corporation. And by the way, these things are going to happen anyway. So let's see. What's the point of trying to slow down, which is a natural cycle that we have a technology replacing certain elements of human activities. Uh, for centuries technology was their machines have been replacing blue collar jobs. Now the difference is now machines are threatening people with college degrees, political influence and Twitter accounts. That's, that's why we, we, we hear all the stories about it, but that's, that's absolutely normal. I think that's, that's, that's called progress. And, uh, um, it's, if machines taking over certain nil, certain menial parts of, of, uh, um, elements or aspects of, of condition, that's, that's not the end of the world. It's, there's still many things that humans can do. All we need is just to look for new challenges and for a new frontiers.

Speaker 2:          22:05          So we just come back from China for the Alphago match against Kj. And one thing that happens in go, which is slightly different from is and go, there's a tradition of players thinking about how far off from optimal play are they are in theoretical God play or optimal play. So how far are you into, do you think even in the top chess computers are from optimal chess? I mean, what do you think that the top e low rating it would be possible to play chess at is? Do you have an idea?

Speaker 3:          22:31          No, I don't know why the idea because I just, we briefly discussed, you know, lunches that um, when you look at the, uh, at the, um, uh, date end give databases and now we have all seven pieces. That's a hundred terabytes or whatever. Uh, and uh, so every position is being calculated from now to the very end. And in many cases you just, you know, we have a position that says, made in 492 moves. And I bet you that in the first 450 moves you will not see the difference. So I could see probably fallen 20 moves. Yes. But it's just, um, now I don't know what it tells about the gay we play because the average human games 50 moves. Now when you look at average machine games, it's maybe 80, 90 moves. It doesn't mean that again should be too long or what we know that, you know, the game of chess is an ultimate end game was suited to pieces.

Speaker 3:          23:21          So that's why I don't see any chance in any future that machine will play e two e four and we'll announce, made in six, 2,755 booths. It's not going to happen. The number of legal moves in the game of chess 10 power 45, that's enough to, to feel safe. Um, but it's not about solving the game. It's about winning the game. And, um, and I think there's still in, oh, some improvement and machines could get better and better as this, as the, I mean is basically sky's the limit. And today I still think magnus was white in his good day. We'll probably secure a draw against the machine. But winning against a computer today, it's virtually impossible, is the, the, the level of precision that required, that is required, the level of vigilance, it's just, it's impossible. So it's a win win. What would you use to Duke to play with such attention?

Speaker 3:          24:12          Um, so, uh, machines we'll get, we'll, we'll, we'll, we'll get better. And by the way we see it, we see an improvement all the time. I remember this as well by writing my books, my great predecessors, and then my mattress against Karpov and then my own, my best games and some of the Games or seven games analyze two, three years later, which is this new version of the same engine and engine. And just, I could see that, you know, there's this, some of the, some of the, some of the moves that are treated as, as, as, as, as great. Uh, uh, in say 2009 in 2012 was Pablo Paulville computer. I had my doubts. Yeah. Very cool. So look, I've got so many more questions, but I know I should, I should give some time. A time. Is A, is moving forward. So I don't know. I should let the audience ask any questions if you put your hand up her high so I can see,

Speaker 1:          25:00          wow. Oh,

Speaker 3:          25:01          we'll silos. We covered everything. Okay. Well let me ask another quick, oh wait a second was the question again?

Speaker 1:          25:06          Yeah, yeah, Yup. Okay. Okay.

Speaker 4:          25:11          So now I went to that school. I was too young when the, the match happen. So I don't have any personal memories.

Speaker 3:          25:18          Yes.

Speaker 4:          25:22          Um, but when they read stories of it, it kind of struck me that, uh, the match seemed like everyone was great publicity, but people really wanted to see whether, well to put the bond, whether you would is against the machine. And I found this really, um, my question is basically, do you feel like this was the case or do you feel it actually felt like a normal, just match where people would see who would win? Or rather, did you feel like you've had support from your side as well?

Speaker 3:          25:51          Oh yeah. I pledge of support. I can tell you that, uh, most, uh, uh, of people who wanted me to lose the grant, the wall of chess now, because I was Awol Chapman for 12 years, and that was the first one I will last. So that's naturally, a lot of people wanted me to lose one day and since I was unbeatable in the human chess, so they, they had that, they had a hopes in the machine, but I had was fear that was phenomenal. And, uh, it's, uh, the, it's a, it was a reflection of the, of the famous cover of the Newsweek, the brain's last stand. And, uh, I remember when I want get one of the match was a big celebration. I get, it was on CNN. They, they talked to you. Did you do the, uh, uh, the two presenters, they, they, they talked about it and said, look, it's, it's, it's a Russian playing in American machine, but I'm rooting for Russian and the questions.

Speaker 5:          26:50          All right,

Speaker 6:          26:54          Dora, great from the Alphago team. Um, humans seem to be more efficient in playing chess and go probably and that they evaluate much fewer variations and physicians than, than computers do. I mean by many orders of magnitude probably can, can you give us an integration of, of, of how this difference can come about what, what are humans actually so good at in chess that they can, can do this so efficiently and that they only need to examine so few, uh, variations as compared to computers?

Speaker 5:          27:29          MMM,

Speaker 3:          27:30          no, we can talk about sort of general rules, but also you should remember that there are different playing styles because the way a carpet or myself, we'll look at the same positions, you'd be very different. It goes, I will maybe look for an opportunity to break through just to sharpen the game cheek, create complications and Carpo we'll bill looking for sort of long term strategic advantage that could manifest in the end game. It's um, uh, those are the differences. Uh, what brings us together is that as you just said, Eh, we didn't have to analyze millions of lines. We couldn't, so we could look for one or two options. How do we know that those two options are the best? I don't know. I just said simply, I know this what it is. Uh, but again, uh, it's the, it's, it's the, then we, we had a lot of subtle difference.

Speaker 3:          28:24          Um, I will probably try to go as deep as I can calculating carp of, we'll try to look for an option where he doesn't have to calculate at all. So we're relying on these understanding because I, many patterns you can recognize patterns and then bringing in patterns together. You can have a picture, big picture. Um, that's, that's what humans are a unique hat. And, uh, that's, that's why for instance, if you are, if you came up with a computer, sometimes, if it was all is that's, I wouldn't go there. It's a, and then it's quite interesting to like to check whether machines calculation proves it. Uh, but in many cases I think it will be right. And, uh, and uh, and the special at the time when machine goes very deep, uh, and then, which is it's horizon. And then you also should look at the position and say, mmm, it smells, it's, there's something wrong.

Speaker 3:          29:12          I don't know exactly what is wrong, but something, something is wrong. Um, there are also situations where you have to calculate when you sacrifice something, you sacrificed material and it's, it's, it's a take it or break it. So you cannot afford to be, uh, to, to, to use your common sense because you are material down. Um, so my gay was Veselin Topalov another one I played in 1999. That's my longest combination. So I, I cannot tell you that I saw whole every line there. It will, we'll be drew. But Dee Dee, the combination, the final position that I saw, it's like an old lightened ink. Just very quickly, what will happen at the end included, uh, the, uh, the, um, uh, it's shitty. Apply links, 15 foot moves. So let's, uh, um, ironically that because I saw this, the final position as late, the machine proved that I could win earlier, uh, couple of miss the chance to, not to escape, but to have test the end game that he could probably defend.

Speaker 3:          30:13          Um, but, um, otherwise it's just, it's, uh, it's, uh, what you described is just another proof of the MORAVEC paradox. That's the, uh, I was going to bring up, you should explain what that is. Could you talk about that a lot? But is that says machines are very good at what humans are not so good and, and other around. So it's a chess. Chess is, it's, it's interesting that chess was probably because go and Shogi day we'll just played elsewhere. But for, for the western science, chess was an ultimate test for, for artificial intelligence. And a, that was another result of 99, nine, nine, seven match that the expectations of, of the founding fathers of computer science, like Alan Turing, Claude Shannon, Norbert Wiener, that machine beating strong chess player. And of course the world champion would be it, this is the moment for AI, I have to say they were wrong. So it's this, this people was as intelligent as your alarm clock. Have

Speaker 2:          31:13          the, a, a theory about the Moravec paradox is that your explanation for that, if you have built systems like deep blue was then, um, as the programmers, you have to understand clearly enough what you're trying to codify explicitly. So you can codify it in a rules or heuristics like deep blue ones. And the problem is, is that for many things that we take for granted as humans, like, um, vision or riding a bike, all these things we do implicitly, we don't explicitly understand well enough how we do those things. So we can't codify it and that, that, but that's why I think that learning systems, the kinds of things like Alphago, my end up being more powerful because they could learn how it from experience, how to do those things like humans do.

Speaker 3:          31:52          No, it's seeds. It's one of the, one of the rules that are learned, you know, from my experience is that anything that we do and we know how we do machines will do better because we can communicate it. So it's one word, knowledge codified. Uh, so the big question is now whether machines can ever do, she really was things that we do without knowing how. Yeah.

Speaker 2:          32:14          Yeah. No, exactly. That's the big question, right. I mean, I think you say in your book, um, up til now, anybody who attempted learning systems and killing your great teacher bottleneck, uh, we're fell short against,

Speaker 3:          32:25          well yeah, the, against the spacey, the hand code. So 40 years ago, cause it's, it's in the beginning there was a big debate and I think that states states, uh, I've been touring car few people, nobody wears a cure or the fourth program in 1950, there was a chess program and did the trick was that there was no computer. This is the only game that the, the tutoring program. Yes, exactly. And just, you know, just he put it on a piece of paper and a calculated the moves and the, and the, when I spoke at decent Tennery, so I asked now friends from Germany to actually reconstruct it and put it in the computer. We can actually play it curing machine, pretty weak, but it's nine 52. So, but they believed, and that's interesting. They believe that uh, uh, the, the way to, uh, to make machines playing chess, it's not brute force, but understanding, but it's, it failed.

Speaker 3:          33:14          This cost of failed very quickly because boot force kept coming and studio, it's all I got was like avalanche. They, they, they couldn't stand a chance. So that's why the, the all the terms including one of my great teacher may call Buttrick uh, to come up with this, with this parallel concept of learning failed and buddy on the 60s, early seventies, it was just, it was, it, the store was over. Now it seems that we're just like an in seasons. We going back to two, these two, these two, this notion, and maybe it will prove to be

Speaker 2:          33:44          or fee Alphago we'll make above and a copy. Then, you know, it hurts. It's sort of a learning system, right? So it turns out the go go needed to, needed to happen. What do you think the difference is between go and chest that required going to have the, you know, have to have this other approach. You know, they couldn't do it. The handcrafted approach.

Speaker 3:          34:00          Um, you know, it's a tough question because I have meal, absolute knowledge of the game of chess and almost zero knowledge of the game go. Yeah. Uh, so, um, uh, but for what I know is that it's the, God doesn't have the same tactical uh, um, configuration. So you, you, you have to, it's all about strategy. It's a long term. And uh, and uh, that's why it's far more difficult for machines to learn how to do that. But also if machines could do at certain level, they, they could be dead lift for humans because it's, it's, they, they, they suddenly become superior. So my, and I, again, I, I'm not sure just I'm sticking to great expert. I still think that relatively, if you compare the strengths, I think the chess playing engines are relatively stronger than Alphago. Uh, it's in absolute ratings but, but, but then you look at it, but then the gap between its just because the mistakes made by human players in golf, they are deadly. They are just the, they, they, they could take an offer more openings for the machine. So in chess, the, the, the, the human game was always unstable. So he's not as, as a state as the machine, but I think in, in God, the, the, the, uh, the depth of, of, of, of the mistake could, could be, um, could be far more significant than in chest.

Speaker 2:          35:22          I guess we'll have to put that to the test by teaching Africa chest to play chess. Right. And then we'll have it, we'll say six.

Speaker 3:          35:29          That'll be interesting. And so how soon Alphago can crush the strongest church. It just engines, again, it's, it's than he's thought about Alphago, but it's about the nature of the game goal go and chess. But I, you know, would you be some pretty surprised if our learning system could beat the handcraft, the systems, Erikson chest? Look, there's, this will be another level of experiment because the, the, the, the current systems, they, it's not primitive brute force anymore. Now it says, that's why I said it's this, it's today. Um, uh, any, um, and by the way, that's the woman that say people just, you're looking at me in this belief from nonprofessional audiences. I said, free chess app on your mobile phone are stronger than the blue. No, no, no, no, no. He says you are so losery I'm so loser.

Speaker 2:          36:15          It doesn't change it though. This is the fact that it's that. Absolutely. Absolutely. It's the now very good. So I don't know if there's a loss

Speaker 3:          36:22          question from the ordinance. We have time for one or two more. Yes. From the lady the fall.

Speaker 2:          36:29          Yes. At the front here

Speaker 3:          36:32          I see kids. Where do you play? Oh, well cool.

Speaker 2:          36:39          Okay.

Speaker 3:          36:39          Yeah. This, the, there are a couple of problems. One, I'm a retired and I don't play professional just to deep blues debt.

Speaker 2:          36:45          Yeah.

Speaker 3:          36:47          Yeah. Uh, um, I, I wanted to blend 90, 98 and I, um, I, I wish I had a chance, but, um, that's, that's it. You know, that's, that's, that's um, old history. It's, um, it's a spilled milk water under the bridge share, you name it. Uh, um, but I, you know, I, I played, uh, played other computers and, uh, as long as I was active chess player, I never dumped a challenge. And, uh, and that's why, you know, the, the, this book begins with a story of me playing sooty to chess computers in 1985. It's similar than as exhibition. Uh, I'm not sure what anyone owns. Still owes, owes the chest machine that's from an antique chairs, machines. Anybody here I still have on the CDC. This is it. So I played a play this, it's silly to machines and there were four manufacturers, eight machines each and I won all the games, most amazing thing that nobody was surprised. And it can tell you the progress. It's just from that match. In 1985, just there played in June, just a few months before I won the title beating Corp of, uh, to my management's Dbu. Just 12 years. It tells you that certain things happening and, but I couldn't help but reminding people about this match 85, because I say that it was a golden age. Yeah. Machines for week my hair or strong.

Speaker 2:          38:19          Yes. We're entering another very exciting, I think, interesting era. I think a, let's all thank Gary for an amazing discussion.

Speaker 1:          38:26          [inaudible].
