Speaker 1:          00:04          Okay.

Speaker 2:          00:05          So Andy is our guest here today. She has been for quite some time, the director of access technology at the National Federation of the blind. And in this role she has worked with top companies like Microsoft, uh, blackboard, Ebay, apple, Google of course, um, to shape the way that they develop and test their products for accessibility. She's now at Microsoft in the role of pm for accessibility on, I knew I was going to not be able to say this, the corporate and external legal affairs team. Um, and she's been in that role since 2015 she's also author, coauthor of a book called insuring digital content accessibility through policies and procedures. And she's got a wealth of experience and knowledge. So I'll just bring her up to start, start talking. Welcome Anne.

Speaker 3:          01:09          Hello. Are you buddy? Yep. Every time. You guys are way amazing. Hopefully I won't put you to sleep. Well, you guys have coffee ready? Doesn't face all right. How could you not have coffee ready when you are in Washington, right? Yeah, exactly. So every time I come to Google campus, whether it is in Kirkland and mountain view, um, New York, I always feel extremely welcoming. I am humbled and grateful by the hospitality that you have extended to me for this many, many years. My, his history of partnering with Google, advocating for accessibility, being a royal pain sometimes for you and other companies will uh, uh, happening, you know, go going back 10 years ago, probably 10 years ago. Wow. Many of you is still, for many of you in this room are probably not in college yet. That amazing. Anyway, um, in the past 10 years you have listen to the voice of customers and I really admire that about Google. I have an opportunity to witness tremendous amount of improvement coming from you and your hard work. And I think it's only right to take time to celebrate. And I want to go to through some of the accessibility improvement that I've seen happening from Google in the past 10 years, which by the way, even though I am working for Microsoft, I rejoice in that. I like accessibility improvement because

Speaker 3:          02:57          at the very heart of who I am, I'm an accessibility

Speaker 4:          03:00          advocate and I live it every day. And so when my peers are successful in this arena, I think we have the opportunity or the obligation to celebrate your success and every other company success that especially those who are willing and commit to accessibility and willing to do the hard work, willing to do what it takes to make accessibility possible. And you may think that partnering across the industry, it's a rare thing, but really honestly it must happen in accessibility. Uh, you and I know very well that we're competing in power priorities every day. I accessibility, accessibility, priorities, let me try again. Accessibility priorities, uh, often compete with other priorities in product development. And if the, and I think the only way for us to gain a foot hole in accessibility is for industry to partner together to move the accessibility agenda forward. Let's face it, if Google does it, wouldn't Microsoft do it? Wouldn't apple do it with Facebook? Do it in turn. If we work in partnership with each other across the industry, then ultimately we'll make our daily work much easier. The um, accessibility improvements that I've seen from Google. It was a dream as of 10 years ago now, but some of these improvements already visible in your products, so let's take time to celebrate some of them,

Speaker 4:          04:53          you know, have Braille in the various platforms of your product.

Speaker 4:          04:59          You know, when we came to Google, we were, we as in the use the users community, especially blind user. We're asking Google Google about Braille and we didn't, we weren't sure what the, we got to get it, but the fact that we have it today, it's something that we need to celebrate. Uh, the Android, oh, sorry, the Chromebook accessibility steadily improving Google apps. Accessibility continues to improve over the years and then with the release of android marshmallow and android. Okay. I must say the accessibility improvement and you have done is I needed to be commended. I know individuals who had die hard apple fan is now, are now taking a look at Android, no kid as viable options. This is something that we need to celebrate. You have a tremendous leadership, uh, team that provide you with proper guidance. And I've come to know many of them.

Speaker 4:          06:11          Um, Eve Anderson, of course, I consider her to be a good friend and great colleague. Uh, I'm going to pick on you Lewis, Anna, Laura, uh, Premera from, um, the chrome team, Sean laureate and Richard John will, I'm going to leave somebody out and they're going to be offended. So I better stop well on the head. So, uh, but your success here, we need to celebrate, but I'm sorry to say that it does not need to be only your success, but we need to work together again to move the agenda forward for the whole industry. Because of this reason, we are creating our products to be accessible and usable by our customers. Our customers are the most important, um, individuals that were served. We are better start listening to them. In the recent years, every company in the industry see the straw procurement language inserted into accessibility, uh, into a procurement policy.

Speaker 4:          07:24          Our enterprise. Customers want to know that when they purchase our products, they want to be reassured that when they purchase our product and the deploy our products and services and that everyone will be able to use our products and services. Now our customers are coming from a very diverse demographic background as you know, and we have the responsibility as technology company to find ways to empower every individual and give them opportunities to be the best that they can be. I also would like to point out to you that the need of our external customers are not very different from the knee of the internal colleagues with disability. It is extremely important and I think imperative for people or for the technology companies to examine our employment environment to ensure that we have an inclusive workforce. Microsoft taking that seriously. I know Google has taken us seriously and I hope more and more people are doing this, so now how can we

Speaker 4:          08:37          ensure that everything that we create is accessible? I would like to propose that we employed three basic principles that I learned to work very well in the past so many years that have been an ad, uh, advocacy for accessibility. And by the way, the experience that sharing with you today I hope will prove useful at the minimum, at least it's thought provoking, is the experience that I gleaned from seeing things happening on both sides of the camp. Uh, I think, uh, my experience is quite unique in that, you know, I used to represent a solely the end users community and now I'm working with major industry player. So, um, so I hope that my experience can be useful to you. But the three principle that I would like to bring to this talk are the following empathy, engineering excellence and policy. We must learn from our diverse pool of our cost of our customers and colleagues with disability when we truly understand their needs. That is, I believe, when we can make the right choice on how we can innovate. As an example, if you have a complicated menu structures, why not just put a edit box, edit feel where people can enter in the command to search the commands name to search for various features in the program. So not everybody has to go through, uh, the, the, uh, complicated menu structures. And this is good for everybody, not just the blind, but um, everyone who you don't, I don't quite remember where the location of certain feature said maybe.

Speaker 5:          10:22          Okay.

Speaker 4:          10:23          So things like that seems simple, right? But, uh, we don't take the time to think about it often enough. So does accessibility design truly make product better? I believe yes. And I think you do too because if you don't believe that it is, so you probably wouldn't be here on Monday morning at 10 o'clock. I, you probably watched the debate. Don't worry, I won't get into it last night. Staying up late and now you're here. So you must have some certain level of commitment to accessibility, which I'm very glad to know now

Speaker 4:          11:01          that let just not take my word on this, right. Uh, less examine historical record. I believe that I have over old 250 years of data to convince you that accessibility actually make our product better. And I'm going to go through them. No, just kidding. Not every, not everything, not everything. So, but let's just look at a three example. If you want to know more. By the way, I have, I had handed my book over to Emma to be included in Google library just for you to use as reference material. But let me, uh, oh, that's good to know. Uh, let, let me mention two or three things. Cordy keyboard. So the qwerty keyboard was created by a man Oh, in the, the 18 set, the late 17 hundreds, uh, some type, some form of this qwerty keyboard, uh, to allow his blind wife to write him letters when he went on many, many long distance business trips.

Speaker 4:          12:10          I'm so thankful that our mode of transportation, it has advanced. We don't have to do a, we don't have to use the same motor transportation in the 17th centuries anymore. But nevertheless, this keyboard in some form, some form of this keyboard has been with us since then. I love the fact that accessibility actually created out of love. That's pretty cool. And standalone reading machine for the blind. So in the 1970s not the Ray Kurzweil who now you have as part of your colleague, I'm pretty jealous about that. Um, he is a beloved figure and among the blind community in the 1970s, he, um, created and invented a stand alone reading machine for the blind. And back then all the machine, it's about the size of a washing machine, I think. Um, and as obviously have a very slow computing capacity. But the groundbreaking thing about this machine is it incorporated a three important technologies, speech synthesizer, omnifont character recognition technology, and a flatbed scanner. Now,

Speaker 4:          13:30          if you asked it, the Kurzweil, and if you don't get a chance to meet him or at many of you have a chance to meet him, I would recommend it. He's a very stimulating individual. He would tell you flat out that this machine was created because he met a adopted daughter genic and the president of the National Federation of the blind, um, in, in the 1970 and up. And he asked atherogenic and what kind of problem and you want to solve for blind people and other children. I said, well, we want to be able to give blind people the ability to read print immediately, seamlessly, easily just as sighted people. Well then they, you know, the doctor Kurzweil and then invented the reading machine. So look at today how individually we use these technologies. Speech, synthesizer, a omnifont character recognition could go use it all the time. I use it all the time. And flatbed scanner, you scan pictures, I dunno, probably weekly or daily and other, uh, technology, uh, invention that start first, uh, for the blind. And, uh, it was the record player and was invented by Thomas Edison. And if you look at his pattern is in my book does a, there he invented the record player because he wants to be able to give, uh, the blind ability to read. Now,

Speaker 4:          14:59          in the last century or more, we have experienced the explosion of a multi billion dollar industry. Uh, I don't know how many of you liked music, but I love music. Um, and so record player just created, you know, to give the blind the ability to read, uh, have really, uh, morphed into supporting, uh, uh, like I mentioned that the multimillion dollar music industry, which is I think is remarkable, uh, from this and sample it ability to design does not only make our products better, but I believe accessibility is a true source of innovation. Again, just look at how these types of technology change how we, the public consume information today. What about current example? Do we have any all right. I believe so. You know, recently Facebook, um, really, uh, invest in image recognition technology now to describe a images on the web. Google, Microsoft, apple provide accessibility out of the box. Um, and uh, you know, you can look at Amazon and their effort in making [inaudible] more accessible. This is [inaudible] good beginning however we must do even more. And you asked why do we want to do more? The reason is we want to do more because unemployment rate among people with disability is still very, very high. And

Speaker 4:          16:41          the technology that we create can help level the playing field for people with disability. If you look at the unemployment statistic for people with disability in the United States, um, just the blind demographic have 70% unemployment rate. The work that you do today matters a lot. Now we friendly guys. If we have a country that has that kind of unemployment statistic, the country would not survive. But yet we have people with disabilities all over the world combating a unemployment rate this high. And again, we have uh, an opportunity to make a difference here in the past 16 years that I have been an at and accessibility advocate, I learn similarly to other areas. I'm queue up too soon. I learned that similar similarly to other areas of computing, security and privacy as an example, it's engineering excellence, also applicable to accessibility and accessibility design. Without engineering excellence, it's not only difficult to integrate accessibility design techniques into the development framework, but maintaining accessibility will also be very difficult if not impossible. The under the industry can do more to support our pms and engineers.

Speaker 4:          18:16          Now, how many of you are pms? Just say I nobody. Just one eye. How many of you are engineers? Wow, that's great. I appreciate you taking the time. I hope not too boring for you just yet. Um, I would like to recommend the following items for your consideration as you are working in Google and as a exists as the industry press forward on accessibility agenda. I really do think, see whether you agree with me. I really do think that you may not want to admit it because you're on camera. You know too. I really do think that the industry should provide engineer with better tooling. No. Yes, there you go. Um, and and we should talk more about that and uh, industry should do more to increase the talent pipeline in accessibility computing area by partnering with Educational Institution to ensure accessibility curriculum. I taught at all level. Let me ask you something guys. Those of you who just graduate from college or been in college for the past 10 years, how many of you are taught accessibility design? Wow. You win in colleges university.

Speaker 6:          19:35          Yeah.

Speaker 4:          19:36          Nobody. I am going to take silence as no buddy. Um, so if, if somebody has been taught, then please, uh, please let me know and I'm, I'm happy for you if you have. So, uh, and the third thing that industry need to do is to celebrate the achievement of engineers who invest in accessibility and make a difference in making accessible products.

Speaker 4:          20:03          And finally, companies can do more to create a well structured mentoring program to disseminate knowledge on accessibility design among engineers. And we're going to take a look at this one by one shortly. But I think that if we take proper steps as an industry, we can swiftly and more holistically, uh, moving sustainability agenda forward. And isn't that our goal? Now, one of the biggest gap that I would like to see the industry solve is tooling engineers and developers need toolings that will enable them to design accessible websites and applications and other products easily, seamlessly going back as far as the wireframe product development stage. Don't you agree? Are you naughty? Won't work. Sorry guys. Um, today when we talk about accessibility, automated tools, we often think about the various accessibility testing tool, both pay and free. Even though these tools are useful, but they can only perform an audit after website or applications are created, accessibility design must truly be built in and not add on it.

Speaker 4:          21:41          We started to think about accessibility after apps and websites are created is absolutely too late. So what does this ideal tool look like? Well, in my opinion, this idea to should have at minimum this feature sets we should find in it a repository of all accessible standard controls relevant to the platform for the engineers to use. This will help eliminate the need for customized controls. I'll tell you one of the things that I, every time I talk to developers, I often tell them, do not use customize controls because if you use customize control, you're going to have to do tremendous amount of work to make those controls are accessible. But it's not always clear that standard controls is any better. Uh, or at least especially for those who are new to accessibility. So we need to make those status control easier to discover, provide guideline.

Speaker 4:          22:54          The two should provide guideline two engineers on how to create accessibility, sorry, accessible and logical layout so that every controller and every piece of content in the applications are on the website, are properly marked up and can be accessed with various input devices that is not, that are not a mouse base. The tool should immediately alert engineers when it detects code that blacks accessibility property before compiling if necessary. The repository of this, uh, the tool should also contain the repository of accessible sample code. This is going to be useful for engineers who are new to accessibility and what to learn, how to code in an effective matter at any given moment. This ideal tool that I'm talking about here should be able to provide the developers and engineers with the ability to simulate how a piece of code will function with the various, uh, popular access technology product that people would disability use. The tool should be able to detect the logical flow and order of how users use the product to come to complete core feature set.

Speaker 4:          24:26          And lastly, we must provide a robust a p I n s d k so that every developer and every engineer's everywhere candy below in an accessible manner. As far as I know, we had many accessibility tools out there, but as far as I know, we don't have a tool that have as comprehensive as feature set as the one I described. And if you do have any, please let me know. I believe though that with the use of AI technology, it is possible for someone to create such a tool. Now here's a challenge for you. Will Google do it first?

Speaker 6:          25:06          Hm.

Speaker 4:          25:08          We'll other player in the industry do it first. Now increasing the talent pipeline. It is important as mentioned for us to do more as an industry to partner with educational institutions to elevate the importance of accessibility, design study two s an equally level off important as cyber securities discipline. You said, wow, really? Do we really need to get that radical? Yes we do. We really do. Accessibility need to be viewed as a core feature set. Many people who graduated from colleges and university today, um, especially if they graduated with a degree in Cybersecurity, uh, there are celebrated, uh, they are recognized for their talent. We need to do the same thing for people who graduate from colleges and university today. We'd great accessibility d design knowledge, what engineer join a firm with the require skill set that the forum, once the company has the obligation to ensure that he or she have opportunities to advance and have a fulfilling career path. Accessibility engineer need to be celebrate. And the success of the engineers who instrumental and pms for that matter who instrumental in developing accessible products

Speaker 4:          26:54          need to be celebrate. And companies need to find ways to, to, um, connect engineers with individuals who is the, who are directly benefiting from that, the application that they created. I think to me by putting a group of engineers with people with disability and listen to the end user, uh, on how products they're products that they create and make it such a difference in their lives, the best way to motivate each other. And lastly, we cannot underestimate the value of a well structured mentoring program, which ultimately will help facilitate knowledge transfer among engineers. You know, and pms for that matter. You know, uh, there's a lot of,

Speaker 6:          27:47          hmm,

Speaker 4:          27:47          you know, for, for whatever reason, uh, turnover among engineers and pm because there's tremendous amount of opportunity across the industry. But, but then what happened when, when excessive and accessibility champion leaves a company, uh, where, where those knowledges, I, uh, has it been preserved anywhere and I think we should do better as an industry, uh, to preserve a knowledge so that engineers, a new engineers can take advantage of what has been done in the past if we take this action. I honestly feel that

Speaker 4:          28:28          engineers can flourish even more than they do today. But before I move on to policy, I know that my life is enriched by your work and the work of many engineers and pm whom I will never have a chance to meet. I want to take the time to thank you. Thank you for the hard work that you have put into this to empower people like me through your, through the various technology that you create. It I'm able to stay productive because of your hard work. So thank you very much for that. I just paid to you an ideal picture of how things ought to be if the industry worked together. But you said, wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute. We're not there yet and here I am. I'm looking for ways to uh, enhance my knowledge and skill today. Is there anything that I can do or do I have to wait until somebody else do something?

Speaker 4:          29:36          No, I don't think you have to wait and I would like to recommend the following for you to consider. I know Cuco have a robust training program and everybody else in the industry should too. And when that end and the engineers and pm should take advantage of the training programs offered by the respective company. Do not. Please do not design in the vacuum. Always partner with accessibility subject matters experts while you're doing your design work. I, if you do that, you will have less regret in the end when possible, and I know your time is the most precious commodity, but when possible, find ways to participate in the ongoing work of the various accessibility standard consortium, either in person or obtain knowledge online if you can do it in person. This is great because it is an excellent way to connect with other experts in the industry

Speaker 4:          30:41          regularly conduct usability, product usability testing even when you feel that your product is compliant and please conduct your product testing with people with disability who used access technology every day. I know that product testing can be very costly, but until we get the right tooling, we need usability testing and if you conduct usability testing, you gained tremendous insight from the end user with disability that you can't just glean from the automated testing tool alone. Code according to accessibility standard and do not code according to a specific type of access technology solution. This is really important because if you decided to pivot one way or the other toward any particular access technology solutions, you may break your product when the next release of that solution came out or when and you're going to be doing your work in vain if that a technology solution decreases in popularity. Finally, let's move to policy. Companies should really think about established strong inclusive workforce policy. I know that none of that Microsoft is benefited greatly by this. We are as good as our people

Speaker 7:          32:13          are.

Speaker 4:          32:16          We have to make sure as an the industry

Speaker 7:          32:20          that

Speaker 4:          32:22          the customers who we serve externally are properly represented by the diverse pool of employees in our organization. If we don't do that, how can we tackle accessibility and understand the nature of the problem in the enough depth and breadth so that we could solve it appropriately? Always aim high. I know engineers aim high, but I am encouraging you to aim even higher when you create a develop products.

Speaker 4:          33:06          Please use accessibility guideline as it meant to be used as a minimum benchmark for accessibility. Don't ever lose sight of the end goal. And the end goal is I'll products and services must be accessible and usable by everyone. Finally, five accessibility champions within your organization at all level. Guys, how many people are here? 10, maybe two. Now, I don't know how many of them walk out. Um, but anyway, that's all. Okay, well, hey weekend too. How about that? Um, but anyhow, um, you can make a difference even within a behemoth company like Google, if you were so committed to accessibility to begin to work together across all level, top down and bottom up and everywhere else in the company. If we take this seriously, I think that it is possible to have an accessible product with every release. So I really feel strongly that we at a cost of something great is about to happen.

Speaker 4:          34:24          10 years ago, accessibility was a word to avoid. Uh, it's, it's a, um, some people said, oh gosh, do we really have to deal with this? I guess, suppose so, because otherwise we, we might be in trouble. We might be litigated against today. Accessibility is no longer as a mandate, but it's becoming something that people are welcome and to becoming something that people really want to move forward with it. So, but it's going to take everybody. It's going to take the end community. Partnering with you is going to take the commitment from your part. It's going to take everybody to move accessibility forward and one day when you grade, oh, I just want to warn you, you're going to get there. And when you have to use glasses, uh, some of you may encounter, um, situational disability. You know, those of you especially who are really active and playing sport, you may have to wear crutches and stuff one day just because you break a leg or something.

Speaker 4:          35:31          And to Kim, you'll productive during those time will be very, very important. And one day you're going to look back and said, know what you find? Count any disability with a permanently or temporarily. I don't have to worry about losing my productivity because technologies are created to be accessible. So I asked for your commitment and I'm giving it to you that I will always be an accessibility advocate. And I hope that I'm able to inspire you or at least give you something, thought provoking to go and really examine your own commitment to accessibility. And I'm hoping to see you and meet with you 10 years from now and recount the progress that I've just done early on in this presentation. All of the various accessibility improvement, Ashley, you know, what, 10 or 15 years from now, we shouldn't be talking about this topic anymore. It should be matter of course. So I thank you for your time and I'll entertain annotated question that you have. Um, okay. So something that came to mind,

Speaker 2:          36:43          uh, during your talk, how to do with prioritizing accessibility. This is always a challenge for every product in every team, um, especially when you have deadlines and other, other scary things that are happening at the same time. How, in your experience, maybe you can give a few examples of ways that you've been able to champion accessibility in a, in a tight environment like that.

Speaker 4:          37:09          Sure. Um, I can't, well, let me, let me just do it this way.

Speaker 3:          37:17          I think we have telemetries, uh, on how our products are used, or at least I hope you do. And I think you do a, we know what core features are a four sided and for the blind and for everybody. And I would start there. What are the core features in your products? And you make that accessible. If you really have to prioritize first, you make that, then those features accessible and, and, and, and then you go from there. It's, I don't think it's rocket science about this, um, because people, uh, and, and I don't mean to be condescending in any way about this. I think

Speaker 4:          38:03          everybody have the same needs. We just access information in a different way.

Speaker 3:          38:11          Does it help at all with respect to a specific example? Um,

Speaker 3:          38:22          I'll talk about a product that actually created an accessibility community, uh, rather than, um, uh, current Microsoft product. Um, and the parallel analogy will be a very much identical. So we were looking at ways to create a portable book reader for the blind, uh, in my work with a company named human where, I don't know, in a 2007, 2006 or something, uh, and we want to make that, uh, we'll play, are accessible. When we started to evaluate what are some core features of a digital book reader. I remember back then, digital book reader are quite, uh, new. Uh, and so we spent some time looking at what, uh, the mainstream industry is doing and then we bring that features into, uh, the development. And the result was one of the most popular, still is one of the most popular stand alone, a digital book reader for the blind called the victor reader stream, which are, it's one of the most exciting project that I got a chance to, to partner with various engineers because we designed everything from the, from the ground up, and we wrestled with this priorities every day. And you do too. So I would say use your telemetry is that you have available to you and make sure those core feature sets are accessible first.

Speaker 3:          39:55          That's great. Thanks. Cool. Oh, do you my question?

Speaker 6:          40:02          Great.

Speaker 8:          40:06          So my name is Dasha and I'm a developer on maps. Uh, before asked me a question, I actually want to turn to the audience a lot of the things and um, and talked about actually we have internally. So in order for your product to shape him, you must pass to given gardening and we have a guard discussion this week, so you're welcome to join us for that. We also have classes running this week because it is a stability week. So educate yourself. There's an Ios and android in a design class happening this week, so you're very, very welcome to come. And my question is actually around Ui. When you were describing your perfect tool or our SDK, um, it made me wonder that we don't even have that for regular stuff. I mean, there is not one place where you can build the Ui depending on what platform you are, you're stuck with that platforms. Um, good and bad points, right? So I think, uh, I don't know if that will ever happen to have one place where you can build Ui and works on everything. Right? Right. Now you build Ui for this platform and then for that platform then for that platform, mostly because otherwise you can't leverage the best parts of a given platform. Um, what do you think about that? Well,

Speaker 3:          41:14          we must work with what we have so far, right? I mean, I honestly feel that if I have this magic tool, they can split code out in all platforms and ensure accessibility of everything everywhere at the same time. That would be best. But when, when we, now we don't, so let me give you an example. In android platform

Speaker 6:          41:37          you really

Speaker 3:          41:39          need to think hard about how people with disability use technologies. So what are an important characteristic of attributes?

Speaker 7:          41:49          Uh,

Speaker 3:          41:50          oh, feature sets that are, uh, to, to them, uh, as an example, I don't know, this is, I think this is correct. Uh, last I checked is correct. So if it's not correct, I want you to correct me. Uh, Andrew, I know get tremendous amount of accessibility improvement. But currently if you develop

Speaker 7:          42:13          mmm,

Speaker 3:          42:15          a webpage, a correctly,

Speaker 7:          42:18          uh,

Speaker 3:          42:19          with proper table mock ups, it in html, uh, you cannot, you can still not use and android no good with top back to take advantage of that mockup. So you still have to traverse table, cell by cell and you know how tedious that think get. So if you understand that people with disability want to traverse table in the way that you do go column by column skip columns and we need to skip roles and we must then in uh, our API around development a framework, we should give the ability for the APP developers to do just that. That's what I meant when I say we really need to, uh, consider the needs of customers even, uh, throughout the designing process. Does it help? Yeah.

Speaker 8:          43:21          So rather than a two, a one to one, what I'm hearing you say, each platform should do better, should care more.

Speaker 3:          43:28          Well, [inaudible] tools is important, right? So if you provide necessary a tutorial in the tool and said, hey, guess what developers now you can take advantage of table mock ups and Itch to Mellon. Here's how you do, here's how you do your development. Uh, it, it's, it's, if the tool has that feature set that will give guidance to engineers and developers, that would be even better. I don't remember that. A, a t access technology simulations that I was talking about. Uh, I don't think anybody has it, but if you were to create, uh, a content and then you render it into an html table, you can immediately see what the behavior of navigating that table with talk back and Braille back and such like right there in the tool. I know I'm dreaming, but I really think it can happen. I really do. Somebody somewhere is going to make this.

Speaker 6:          44:28          Thank you. I'm Wilson

Speaker 9:          44:32          working or the, uh, uh, enterprise, uh, how fronted. So like, um, we've been testing our products with the various degree readers, like, you know, like [inaudible] to be more like the primary ones. And then I'm surprised. I'm just kidding. And then, um, and then we also, we also use a, a voiceover and then lead a NBDA yeah. To test it. Uh, but, uh, is there any like effort, uh, you know, put into standardize all of these screen reader is still, so there was less surprised that we, we turn to another screen reader and behave totally differently. For example, voiceover, it was like, you know, there are a lot of cases that I just, it just doesn't work.

Speaker 3:          45:11          There's a lot of nuances. I don't know all the concentrate efforts.

Speaker 7:          45:18          Yeah.

Speaker 3:          45:19          Uh, it, it needs to happen. And then one of the things that we can do is code according to sensibilities that if everybody does that, and I think we can unify a, some of the different, uh, you know, the unified the differences and make it, uh, less so. A M I a t a I know when to under compensated and overcompensating for worth weapons, disability or any accessibility standard that makes it very difficult for developer to develop. Now I also understand the 80 manufacturers predicament though they need to serve customers. So here again, partnership between you and a t,

Speaker 7:          45:59          uh,

Speaker 3:          46:00          solution providers, whether it would be your peers, uh, Microsoft, uh, apple. I'll even bode potty a t. It needs to happen

Speaker 7:          46:10          more and I'm,

Speaker 3:          46:13          I would love to hear your thought on how we can bring this about too. This is not just my conversation to you. This is a bi directional conversation. So you have some ideas. Uh, Anna, how to get in touch, knows how to get in touch with me. Please let me know.

Speaker 7:          46:28          Okay.

Speaker 3:          46:30          I'm being kicked out. I think we are actually been kicked up. Thank you, Anne, for coming. A wonderful Todd.
