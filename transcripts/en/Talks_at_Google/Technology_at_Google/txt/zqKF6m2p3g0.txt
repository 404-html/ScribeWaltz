Speaker 1:          00:00:08       Okay. Everybody. Thank you guys so much for coming. We really appreciate you guys coming out with an awesome talk for you guys. We have Ben, you simmer. Mom got over here and, uh, I'd love to kind of introduce them. So, uh, Ben, uh, once a Harvard, he actually dropped out to become a teal fellow. Uh, 2013, he got into crypto. Uh, he turned 15 k into what is now over $1 million. Uh, he wrote the crypto one on one post on medium, which is great kind of primer. If you're not familiar with crypto. It's a great kind of intro introductory, just a overview of the space. Uh, and so I sent it to a lot of my friends if they're, you know, they're not really familiar. Um, he actually became a kind of an internet celebrity in his own right. Uh, so we got over 50 million Facebook views on his videos and he realized that he just didn't profit a dime off of those videos.

Speaker 1:          00:00:57       And so he realized that there was kind of a problem. Uh, and so he decided to create stream, which kind of disintermediation, uh, the creators and the audience, um, and allows creators to kind of profit more and engage more authentically, uh, with their audience without being beholden to kind of outside interests. Uh, so simmer is the other cofounder of stream. Uh, he graduated from Stanford where he studied AI and bio computation. He built one of the top 14 apps in the APP store, which gained him recognition from both the White House and the Department of Education. Um, and he built one of the first Ios apps to do realtime video classification. So I already touched on what stream does it disintermediate content creators and, uh, and, and the audience and allows kind of creators to engage more authentically, uh, you know, without being beholden to outside interests. And, uh, yeah. Without further ado, I'll give it up for team stream.

Speaker 2:          00:01:53       Yeah. First off, I just want to

Speaker 3:          00:01:55       knowledge thank you guys so much for being here. I know this is lunch time. Like really appreciate you guys all coming out and supporting us. Um, and just listen to what we have to say. It's always, uh, it's always definitely a bucket list side of it's always been on my list. So thank you so much for bringing us here and giving us the chance to talk to you guys. Um, so really quickly, you know, I think Bitcoin, right? There's a lot of, if you guys been falling recently, um, and this is just like a quick story. All the rage. I was literally at Thanksgiving, this pit. So this pat, you know, this past Thursday, um, and I was sitting at the dinner table and my uncles, my cousins, literally, everybody's like, how do I get into bitcoin? Then you hours in crypto. And they were like, Whoa, like I want to buy.

Speaker 3:          00:02:31       Like it was like a news. It was show interesting to kind of see the energy there. Cool. So real quick also I want to give you a quick background of how everyone is in this room, right? So raise your pans. You guys have no exposure to crypto. You guys want just like a full introduction. The only one here who just like it doesn't know anything about crypto. All right. How many of you guys actually feel like you are pretty proficient. You understand what bitcoin is, how it works, talking, glue, all those things. Raise your hands. All right, cool. Awesome. Awesome. That's somewhere between that, right? This is perfect. That's exactly what the song is. So awesome. That works all sure. Okay. So just really quick and you're going back to the, to the story show. She comes up to me, she's like, I want to buy bitcoin.

Speaker 3:          00:03:12       That I was like, okay, this is, I feel like he's like a teaching moment. And so I went, I've got a piece of paper and it was like, let's make your own coin. Right. And we, we called it, we called it and Sarah coin because it was her name. Um, and it was like, okay, go and see if you can actually get something from this, right? You have this piece of paper, this is your Sarah coin. Let's see what you can do. Right. And she went and she got, she actually like ended up getting like, she's got an extra slice of Pumpkin pie by the end of the day. Um, one thing that's really interesting and that was, that was for me like one thing that's really interesting, it's like this idea of what really is money, right? Like when we think about these coins, like what does, what constitutes value in a specific currency, right?

Speaker 3:          00:03:52       Um, and I think that's, you know, a lot of we're going to be touching on today, um, specifically within our talk is thinking about what is the history of money in Bitcoin? How does it actually fit in? How have we created this? Right? A lot of people think it's a scam, it's fake money. Like all this, like how do we actually think about this and actually diving in some of the fundamentals then actually thinking about, okay, what are these next layers of technology smart contract disintermediation, what does that look like? And then finally we'll kind of close out with, I know there's a lot of new crypto projects coming out, some of our thoughts on crypto economics. Where does that actually have space right in the current ecosystem and what are the value propositions there by actually taking a case study through stream? The project that me and Ben are both working on.

Speaker 3:          00:04:29       So at that I'll let Ben kind of take it away with who had some, a lot of the history of money, uh, in boy. Yeah. You mind if I grab the clicker, go for it. Awesome. Sooner. I'm going to walk through all those, but also I want to make sure that you guys are giving the value that you want to own this. So at any point, you know, I'm going to stop and have questions between instruction and then you guys tell us up. You know, that's exciting. That's interesting. Or if you want to dive in to somebody else. So real quick, I think it's important to us take bitcoin in the context of where it came from. Right? And what was the motivation behind it. And there's very clearly motivated by the 2008 financial crisis. So the bitcoin white paper came out immediately basically after this happens.

Speaker 3:          00:05:04       And you could see those, a straw moving factor because in the first bitcoin transaction that actually, and I had a headline from Mica UK newspaper, whereas like banks are on the brink of bail out right from governments and so will happen in 2008 well it's super interesting because we had a lot of things that contributed to the financial crisis and I'm sure you guys are all aware, right? The great recession occurred and why have recurred specifically was because of a lot of the parts of the mind, sorry, system today. So one of the first main parts of how money works say is fractional reserve banking. So real show of hands is anyone Miller? Warren fractional reserve banking is, okay. Awesome. Great. So I'll explain this from scratch. So one story short, when you give $1,000 to bank today, they are legally allowed to go out and spend up to $900 about money, right?

Speaker 3:          00:05:49       So they have a requirement that they have a reserve that they have to keep up customer deposits. And that's about 10% so when you give a bank $100 million right? They only have to keep $10 million on hand. What that leads to our two main problems, like it happened, right? In most cases, this is totally fine because if you trust your bank, you're not going to go out. You're not going to take all your money out. Very rarely do people take more than 10% of the deposits at one time out of the bank, right? And only when that number is reached, are there any problems? So 90% of the time, everything's totally fine, but when people do start to have a panic or people wanting to take their money out, or there's some sort of a issue that they're seeing in the system, it can collapse very quickly, right?

Speaker 3:          00:06:28       So you have a liquidity crunch. So if more than 10% of people want to take their money out, then the bank is like, all right, we can't give you money. Right? And that's when things start spiraling in a really bad way, because that leads to more panic, right? And you have this vicious cycle where more people are trying to take money out. That's not quite exactly what happened. 2008. That's what happened in say, the Great Depression, right? You have this phenomenon knows as bank run where all you see these like lines rather people just outside the bank trying to get their money. And that's because the bank doesn't have your money anymore. And the other aspect of this that's really bad though is when they spend your money, they put it into investments, right? They're trying to, they're basically taking your money and like earning money with your money and they can do this poorly.

Speaker 3:          00:07:06       So what actually happened, 2008 was we had the subprime mortgage crisis. So they put money in these highly inflated mortgages that were being, uh, lends out to all these people who couldn't really pay it back, right? So then we have this huge problem where they lost a lot of this money or now they're left holding these assets in foreclosure, which are just worth way less in reality. Then they were on paper. And then so the whole system basically start glossy. And so the government after the great depression was like, holy crap, this is really bad. Because in the Great Depression, all the banks failed, right? And so they created this thing called the FDAC, right? The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. So you guys are probably familiar, you know, right now, if you put your money in bank, it says $250,000 are insured by the FTC. And this gives you some of New Year of like safety.

Speaker 3:          00:07:50       It's like, oh, don't worry. It's fine if the bank goes down, the government's got your bag. Well, the unfortunate thing is the FTC has actually justice underfunded as banks, in fact, more so, they are legally only required to keep 1% of all customer deposits that they insure on hands. So if you can see here f more than 1% of bank deposits are defaulted on. They actually don't have the money to save the day. And so this isn't just a hypothetical, it's actually happened before. There's a thing called the savings and loan crisis back in the 1980s and so in rapid succession, and again, things are almost always fine, but when they go bad, they go bad very quickly and very Kasra optically, right? It's a brittle system, right? So everything's okay, but when it breaks a showers and so in the savings and loan crisis of 1980s out thousand banks, out of the 3,200 of these bags that are called like saving space, right?

Speaker 3:          00:08:41       They felled in rapid succession and there's actually sister insurance corporation to the see that was the federal like savings and loans, uh, insurance corporation. And that immediately was like, holy crap, we don't have the money to like save a fraction of these banks. Right? So they actually had to be recapitalized again and again with taxpayer money, which is exactly the same thing we saw happen, say 2008, right? Where the government's basically at the expense of taxpayers saved all these banks and bailed them out. And in fact, even with all these bailouts of the governments gave f a F, s, l, I, C or whatever it's called. Um, yeah, they gave up after only fixing after basically recovering about 300 of the banks out of the 1000 films there. I got there. I'm good. Cool. Keep it. They actually dissolved themselves. Right? And so we've actually seen this happen in practice.

Speaker 3:          00:09:33       So the FDI see again, very poorly capitalized, just like normal. A normal banks are too. So not that much safety. And then this problem is actually compounded by Fiat currency. So this goes back to the idea of like what exactly is money, right? And money today, as we know it is generally a currency that's issued and controlled entirely by government and backed by nothing but faith and that government. So in the past we used to have these things called say gold standards, right? And that's something that's pretty easy. It's to understand that it's like at the, you have a dollar, you could redeem it for a certain amount of gold, right? And so you always knew that your dollar had value because it was backed by gold. Now since the 1970s since the Nixon Nixon shock, we actually have currencies are completely free flowing, darn backed by anything but trust in the government.

Speaker 3:          00:10:17       And so this is extremely interesting because what it means is that if you actually look through the test of time, no Fiat currency is actually ever survived a long enough time scale. And the reason for that is because you always have a central point of failure and the government. So as long as you trust your government to be very responsible for your money throughout its entire history, then everything's fine, right? It's totally great. But that's a, that's a bigF , right? And in most cases actually you can't actually trust the government to always be perfect all the way through, right? And so they can do a lot of different things. You know, quantitive quantitative easing happens now we have, you know, every four, eight years new president comes in, right? They change economic policy. And so you're privy to all these things that you don't really have that much agency over but have a huge potential impact on you.

Speaker 3:          00:11:00       And so we can see this, some classic examples. For example, our Zimbabwe, everyone mostly knows, I guess about what happened there. This is the classic example of what hyper inflation can do. And you can actually see it like really spirals out in this crazy way over time, right? So just in a matter of months, it's like, all right, it's getting pretty bad. You know, like, uh, your money's not really worth that much anymore. And it's like, all right, things seem like maybe they're okay, but holy crap, now it's really bad. And so like at the end of this thing, right, it's like you would be in the grocery store and by the time you entered the grocery store and by the time you left, like your money would have like doubled in like a, it's diluted the value. And so they ultimately collapsed. But that is not just, people think that that's the domain of just like, you know, these really third party governments are really poor.

Speaker 3:          00:11:43       Actually, it's true right now, today in Venezuela as well. But even with the u s when the u s first started, few people know this. We create a currency called continental back in 1775 and within three years of lost 80% of its value within 13 years in hyperinflated so much that they actually had to completely abandon constant downsell currency and issue an edict that you can only have currency that was backed by gold or silver because why would anyone trust the US government? Right? And so it's interesting in that. So let's move, uh, it's a good segue into basically gold and why gold has held its value as a calorie points, a Fiat currencies well over 5,000 years plus. So there's record this and people using gold as a store value since 3000 BC today, it's still holds its value, in fact, intelligence value pretty, uh, well over that entire 5,000 years and no Fiat currency has ever come close to that.

Speaker 3:          00:12:33       So let's explore why that's the case because it's a good analog to what bitcoin has this value as its value proposition. Because bitcoin was actually designed essentially at one form as a better form of a gold. So gold has value because there is no central point of failure. It's trustless and that you don't have to depend on the bank or you know, a central bank or government to issue gold, you know that. No, so the problem with a Fiat currency again is that, um, the central bank can issue money on demand, right? And so when you create new money, you have flaked the money supply, but you don't actually change the economy. So the economy is say, $100 million and you have $100,000 discount, $100 million, then you know, um, that's if someone prints twice as much money, you're basically diluting everyone who holds us dollar say, right?

Speaker 3:          00:13:20       You're having the money supplied. And so actually in practice we have a designed inflation rate of an average about two to 3% every year. And that doesn't seem like too much. But compound interest means a about every 20 years your money halves in real buying power. So if you have $100 today, it's actually getting by basically $50 worth of things in 20 years. And so gold solves this problem because it's inherently scarce. You know that there's no central bank that could at any point just make more money. And so because of that, people will put a lot faith and gold. And also there's no one part that you have to trust. And um, let's see. There are some caveats of goal too though, and that we think that it's scarce. We think that production can actually increase, but actually you can because it's not future proof.

Speaker 3:          00:14:06       What I mean by future proof is we've gotten a lot better and a lot of technology, right? And part of that technology that we've gotten better at is mining gold. So you can actually see here in the last a hundred years, our gold production has about a quadrupled, right? And so we used to do about 705 tons of gold production back in 1912. Now in 2014, we do 2,880. And that's because it's a lot easier to my goal today then it was a hundred years ago. It's way easier to mind goal today than it was back in like Roman times. Right? And so we have this false sense of the supply is scarce, but it's actually not that scarce. And in fact, half of all the gold as ever been mined in history has been mined in the last 50 years. So this is like a pretty wild thing. And like there are other things that can happen too.

Speaker 3:          00:14:46       For example, someone could spontaneously finds a huge cache of gold in California spark a gold rush. And so there were all these things up. While it seems scarce, it's not quite predictable and that's important. And so let's compare this with bitcoin. Let's walk into why bitcoin has value in the world today as a store of money, right? And so bitcoin that like gold is valuable because it is inherently scarce, but more so than that it's also inherently predictable. And so this is extremely important because in order to be able to really value your money over time, and you have to know that you know how much money there is, right? You have to know that the money supply is going to be a predictable increase. And then from that you can understand, you know, how the economy is going to function. So here we can actually say this is how gold production has worked over time, where bitcoin production has worked over time, where at the very beginning of time we used to every 10 minutes on average about 50 big ones.

Speaker 3:          00:15:47       And then over time the House that goes to 25 bitcoins, 12.5 6.5 3.15 and so forth until it finally evens out that I'm 21 total million bitcoins. So you can compare these two lines, right? This is how gold production works every time. This is how bitcoin production works over time. And the reality of bitcoin production follows this curve. Exactly. Basically. And so how does this exactly work? And um, feel free to jump into this if you want, but um, yeah, basically long story short, Bitcoin was designed to be future proof because it's governed just by code, right? And what we mean by that is it is dictated that on average, one bitcoin that's going to be found every 10 minutes or one on one block is going to be found every 10 minutes. And in that block there's a coin base transaction in initial transaction that rewards this new 50 bitcoins are 25 bitcoins to 12.5 bitcoins.

Speaker 3:          00:16:35       So how exactly does that work? Well, basically in order to mine Bitcoin, I'm sure you guys have heard of this term of mining bitcoin, right? It's an analog to basically gold production, but in southern mining it out of the ground, you're now mining it with a computer. How do you mind that? If your computer, it uses a one way cryptographic Hash function, right? And so it uses sh a to 56 which is beautiful because the hash function is something that is one way, meaning that it's trivial for you to calculate the output, but it's extremely difficult for you to actually reverse engineer this, right? And find the input from the outlet, which means I basically, you need to brute force this function. So in more technical terms specifically where you're trying to do is you have a nonce and arbitrary increment number that you basically have to run this function through this hash function, right?

Speaker 3:          00:17:18       So you're trying to find a output that starts with a leading number of Zeros. And so the more zeroes that they, this algorithm tells you that you need, the harder the problem is exponentially, right? And so what it can do is it can adjust to the difficulty of how many people were mining bitcoin at any given time. So say at the very beginning, it was just a Toshi, right? The Guy who made the coin, he's minding his laptop and he can do maybe one hash per seconds, right? Of this algorithm, right? He can calculate one Sha function. So he's going through this whole thing. So let's say he can do 60 hashes per minute, and that's 600 hashes per every 10 minutes. So what would the bitcoin algorithm do? It would say on average, you're going to find the solution to this problem. Every one out of 600 of the tops, right?

Speaker 3:          00:18:02       It's going to make it as difficult as one off 600 temps. So on the average, he'll find that every 10 minutes. But now let's say ps two computers, there's someone else starts mining bitcoin. What happens? Well now let's say they can both mind that one has per second. So now they're doing 1200 hashes per every 10 minutes. So on theory you should see that they would be finding a bit coin every five minutes, right? But what the bitcoin algorithm can do is every 2016 blocks, it readjusted difficulty. So it's like, all right, how fast are we finding these bitcoins? Let's actually change this algorithm such that now on average you find a bit coin every 1200 ashes as opposed to 600 and so forth, right? And so this is extremely important because it actually means that not only is it a future proof against many people starting to mine bitcoin, but it's also future proof against technology that makes it much easier to mine bitcoin.

Speaker 3:          00:18:47       So at the very beginning we were using CPU is to mine bitcoin. That was not that efficient, right? Then we move to gps because that can paralyze the process much better. And that was a lot faster. But now we've actually progressed beyond that to application specific integrated circuits [inaudible] that can mind bitcoin because that is better than anything else because that's their sole purpose in life, right? Is to solve this Saj two 56 hash function. And if this was gold, right, we would be finding bitcoins like every second. Right. As opposed to every time, minutes, but it's not gold. And so it has adjusted perfectly to the difficulty over time. And difficulty is like this absurd number now. It's like, exactly. Yeah. But um, yeah. So let's, let's talk about some other, but both at, so basically let's, if we were to compare the coin and gold together, then this is the easiest way for me at least to see what the value proposition of bitcoin is.

Speaker 3:          00:19:36       So in one sense we have this currency that has value because it's decentralized to gold is decentralized and trustless. Right? You don't have to trust that. And part of the end, it's inherently scarce. That's what gives it value. Because people trust. If I hold gold, no one's going to inflate this thing. It's always going to retain value because other people are gonna Trust at the same scarce. Bitcoin on the other hand has all those same benefits, but ours even more predictable, right? It's also decentralized. No one controls it, right? No Central Bank can be like, I'm going to print more bitcoins because it's only by the code. And the code is actually very strongly, uh, secured by this whole hashing algorithm, right? All these miners are mining bitcoin. Um, basically you would need at least 51% of all the mining power in the world in order to actually attack bitcoin and change it.

Speaker 3:          00:20:17       And then, so there's some technicality there, but I'm actually, I can get inside. So the technicality is very specifically, bitcoin holds the longest chain to be the valid chain. And so whoever has the most hashing power is more likely to find blocks then someone who has lost hashing power, right? So if you have 60% of the hashing power, you're going to find blocks roughly twice as fast as someone who has 30% of hashing power at least until the difficulty just right. And so in that case, if someone has 60% of the hashing power, they could, um, basically control the chain and they can decide which blocks, uh, include which transactions and so forth, right? So that's why if you have over 51% of the mind power, that's when it becomes directly possible. It's a control bitcoin. But again, because everyone's rationally self interested and trying to get as much money as possible, there are a lot of miners, right?

Speaker 3:          00:21:01       And they're all basically fully decentralized across the world. So it's very difficult for any one person to get 51% of the power once bitcoin gets so large. And so, again, bitcoin's very secure, very trust worthy because you don't have to trust the central party. There's no central point of failure and it's inherently scarce, but not only is inherently scarce, it's also inherently scarce and very predictable fashion. So those are the benefits on top of gold. But the other very important benefit, the one that Sitoshi really wants to drill down in is that is an easily transactable currency. So you can go around and like a pound of gold, right? And like shave off. Like it was small amounts to like pay for coffee every day or like you know, your bus ticket and all that. People would be like, what can I use this for? Right.

Speaker 3:          00:21:40       And you really can't use gold that well. In fact, it can only be used in person, right? You can't send it to someone in China easily. You can't mail them goal. There's something about you could, but it'd be terrible. But a big point on the other hand is extremely trivial. Really easily transactable to anyone in the world because it is, this is something that people say is like a downside. A bitcoin, right? They don't understand that. Like they're like, it's intangible, right? Like at least with gold, I can hold it in my hand, right? Or paper, you know, like I can use this toilet paper or kindling if I need it to. Right. There's like some tangible value to it. Bitcoin is this complete intangible concept. Actually that's a strength of Bitcoin, right? Because what it means is that it's extremely easy to transact in bitcoin across any border, right?

Speaker 3:          00:22:19       There's nothing but information that constitutes the value of bitcoin. Therefore, you can transfer it extremely well. And so by its native state, it was designed such that, you know, is as easy to send a transaction for a cup of coffee, $3 right? Anywhere in the world locally or to someone in China or to someone in the Philippines, right? You can buy a car, have it just as easily and justice cheaply as you could buy a cup of coffee. So such very powerful. And then, um, yeah, and then so let's talk about some hesitations that people have and skepticisms that people have about bitcoin. And so the one, the first one that they say, right, is that, you know, there's no intrinsic value, right? There's nothing here that I can hold in my hands, right? And so the counterpoints of that is, this is a point made by a sapiens actually really well where money ultimately is just a denigration of the amount of trust that people hold in that form of money.

Speaker 3:          00:23:12       So what I mean by that is actually if you look at gold, right? You can say, sure, gold has value because it can be used as jewelry or it can be used for industrial purposes, right? We put it in our laptops and things like that. But actually if you calculate the value of goal today and how much of it is used for industry and jewelry, it's about 12% of the value of gold is actually what's used for industry. The rest of it all, 88% of it comes from thin air, basically. Right? Like what accounts for that rest of the value? Well, that's actually just the trust that people have in it as a currency, as a commodity, as opposed to the value of as a jewelry or no industrial use case. Same for money today, right. You say this thing has a physical, tangible like value, right?

Speaker 3:          00:23:52       I have a piece of paper in my hands, but actually how much does it actually cost? What is the value of that piece of paper? It's about 5 cents for the government to make a dollar bill. So what, where is that 95 cents a bike? Uh, you know, value come from, it actually just comes from trust in the u s dollar, right? And it comes from trust that this thing has value. So ultimately in that sense, bitcoin can be seen as almost the most pure form of money because there's nothing but trust, right? And as abstract away, the need to have any tangible component and there's just this intangible component of trust and that's where it's value comes from. The other big question then skepticism that people have about the coin, it's like what can you actually use it for? Right? And so they're like, Yo, it's used for drug money, right?

Speaker 3:          00:24:29       It's like this illegal money that people spend or you know, it's really just black market stuff right now, right? Like no one's actually using it to like pay their salaries in this stuff. And one that's actually changing very quickly. But two, this is a, bitcoin is a nascent technology that's just been formed, right? And it's something, this is a criticism that has been lobbied time memorial to basically every single new technology is top end, right? So this is a, this is one of the most interesting articles though. It was a famous article back in 1995 by one of the first pioneers of the air that actually, and so he wrote this huge thing on Newsweek. He's like, all right, everyone's like super excited about the unit today, right? They think it's going to be like this magical thing that's going to change everything about what we do.

Speaker 3:          00:25:08       Right? And like this is just all bullcrap because like they talk about things like we're going to have libraries online, we're going to have like town meetings, we're going to have commerce and businesses going to somehow shift from offices and malls, right. To like the Internet. Right? And like we're going to have things that like make government more like a democratic, like no. And then he's like, this is just all totally false, right? Like no CD ROM or online databases can like replace Your newspaper, right? Nothing like this is ever going to happen to all that and fight they ass. These are totally right. He was absolutely correct back in 1995 none of these things were remotely possible, right? There's all these like visions like these far fetched plans that people had, but none that were possible then. But all of these things have come true today, right?

Speaker 3:          00:25:46       And so that's where it's interesting in that like people who are focused on what bitcoin is today, I believe are taking it from the wrong timescale, right? In fact, even if you were to take bitcoin and just compare it today versus other forms of money, it's done incredibly well because what gold has a 5,000 year headstart, u s dollars have a 300 year head start. If you were to compare them on the same timescale, actually bitcoin, this one, the best performing currencies and nine years, right? It's gone from basically nothing and value to over $170 billion in value in just nine years. And it out to constant as a currency. The U s currency, right. In nine years there was actually hyper inflating, it was basically going down to zero at the same time that bitcoin has retained its value in skyrocketed and same thing of gold, right? Gold's value is about seven point $5 trillion for the total sum of all the gold that's ever been mined in the world. Bitcoin 170, that's about one 40th the size of the whole market value of gold and something like one, 2,500

Speaker 4:          00:26:44       of the time. Right? Like took to get to that value. So that's uh, that's the other point though is interesting. So just really quickly, um, and this beer wanting to diamond a little bit into some of the technical pieces because I think one thing that's been engineers, like why is it this has been done in the past. There have been, there have been currencies and other things. Why haven't they worked? Um, I think one thing that's really interesting is thinking about actually what are the technological innovations within bitcoin that has made this possible. Ben Thompson, some of these, but one key problem that often comes about is like there's the double spending problem. How do you ensure that, you know, money isn't sent to two different accounts. How do you ensure like authenticity of transactions and all these things and part of this kind of just comes down, it's a very simple like cryptography, breakthroughs in cryptography in the way that was manifest from the bitcoin was really, really profound.

Speaker 4:          00:27:30       And it's a specifically, right for those of you guys, how many of you guys actually own a big, like own some amount of cryptocurrency or bitcoin? Just put quick show of hands. Alright, awesome. One of the things, one of the most profound things for me, it was like, you know, the first purchase of, of cryptocurrency and one of course it's under an exchange, but then recognizing for example, public private key pair is like what does that actually mean? Um, and I actually show of hands how many people, how many people know, like your private key is, or a public key is within the context. Yeah. A lot of you guys. Yeah, it's huge. Super, super important. Um, decide, you know, this basically a way for people to communicate and, and ensure the signature and the person that is sending some message right is actually factually correct transactions.

Speaker 4:          00:28:09       Another really interesting idea, and this guy's actually goes into the Eto blockchain, um, in basically this idea that transactions kind of point to the next transaction to the blockchain. You basically have a linked list of different transactions that are coming in, right? That are overall being mined as Ben said. Right? And then added basically to a note, right? Like basically the mining is calculating this cash id. You as a person send a transaction that goes into a memory pool. All these transactions are put into a block. That block is now appended to the node. That node is then broadcasted rate the is and broadcast broadcasters to the rest of the network. So this, in terms of some profound realizations here, like bitcoin has this college, like ultimately what are you trusting? What are you putting your faith in? It is that you have basically this global ledger, right, of everything that is happening and complete transparency to how the system works.

Speaker 4:          00:28:59       You're not looking at a bank and wondering how it's printing new money, how everything is happening. It's a completely clear and transparent system enough that people can believe and trust that the system works. Right. That's so far, yes, there are these clear technicalities and points of vulnerability, but that a lot of that, right, we, in terms of how we're moving forward, right, with skill, um, to fact that you need to take 51% of all the mining half hour to be able to actually conflict an attack. Like of course there are all these problems, but at the same time there's an enormous amount of technical, um, stepping that has been going forward that has actually pushed a lot of blockchain and a lot of bitcoin right now and will continue to in the future. So this also, now I'm brings us to questions cause I know

Speaker 3:          00:29:41       we covered a lot about bitcoin and money and a lot of these pieces and we just want to take a really quick pulse to see how people are feeling. Yeah. Question. Oh, sorry. Yeah, we'll, yeah, we'll repeat the question every time. And it said, oh, great, awesome. Yeah. Question.

Speaker 5:          00:29:57       The valuable relative to the intrinsic value of Bitcoin in particular goal was for investment or it for investment purposes. The demand for billing for industrial purposes is very less, right? So if the price of gold course started dropping, the usage of gold skyrocket. Absolutely. Yup. They did that 12% of industrial use because it's elastic means that it's going to act as a dampener on the other 80% of the speculative value. Yep.

Speaker 3:          00:30:41       Yes. John, just to quickly clarify, it was, that was, that was a long one. Okay, so just real quick rephrasing the question. Ben Talks about gold, 12% being right, it's kind of industrial purpose serves as a dampening effect. How does that factor in like absolutely. Great question. We're talking about the elasticity of gold. Exactly. Yeah, so that's beautiful. And again, anything that you guys saw that I said that you guys have skepticism about, that's where we want to talk with right now. Right? Because that's a Penn south question because what that means is that's basically the transactional base for gold, right? It means that even if we wiped out all of the value of currency, uh, that gold has is a commodity or a currency or like spectrum of value or anything like that. There would be some use case as industry. And you're right, right?

Speaker 3:          00:31:20       Like that mountain would go up as the price of gold fell. So it would provide a base value, right? Well actually that base values, I'm just, the thing that you were the abstract away from like the rest of that currency's value. So what I mean by that is like let's say what is that wants to see proof point. So [inaudible] Gold's industrial value is $1 trillion or something like that. Right now I'm like f f everything else was removed from no one trusted as a currency. It was only used for those industrial purposes and that would be basically the entirety of that economy, right? There's like no. So supply and demand is going to dictate the, as the value drops, you're going to have more industrial uses. Absolutely. But there's a, there's a cap on the market cap of all that gold. It's how much people are willing to pay for it.

Speaker 3:          00:32:05       And so that would be at some point, right there will be certainly lower than seven point 5 trillion today. So like for example, I'm saying like how much does everyone in the industry willing to pay for those industrial use case of gold? You're absolutely right, but they were consumed all the gold available, right? They would certainly consume all the supply, but they wouldn't actually pay seven point $5 trillion for it. Right. They would pay some fraction of that price. Does that make sense? Like you're saying it's elastic, right? So they'll pay maybe half the price of gold today, they'll consume twice as much gold, right? At half the price. Is that what you mean by the loss of sea? Correct. Yup. Basically my is that even if everyone today decided that, you know, oh, I don't want to store my goal. Absolutely. It's not going to lose 80% of its value.

Speaker 3:          00:32:45       It's going to lose. Yup. Exactly. Yeah, yeah, yeah. So to be specific, right? It's like if the price goes down, they're being consumed more gold, but they're going to be paying less for it, right? So that the market cap is still dropping, right? So because like if you're consuming twice as much gold at half the price, then you're still actually contributing to the same market cap, right? So that's basically what I'm saying is that like, yeah, you're absolutely right. It wouldn't drop all the way, but that actually probably would be somewhere in between. You know, what they're paying for goal today and we're gold as day, right? So as certainly what drop, but then again, what we're focused on is that difference in that, um, the difference between all the money that, um, industry would pay for gold and we're gold's prices today, right? And so that's basically, there is certainly some difference there, but even so, right?

Speaker 3:          00:33:30       Like you could actually make that same argument from Bitcoin, right? There are actually transactional use cases for Bitcoin, for example, you can say, um, there is western union, right? It basically, eclipse is western union and all of those payment purposes. So Western Union is about the $10 billion currency a company today, right? There's about $10 billion of value and money transaction between people in the states and like people in the Philippines and so forth, right in bitcoin actually has that same kind of industrial use case, right? And there are a lot of other use cases that are coming out over time. So yeah, um, basically the, there is certainly value there. What we're trying to segment the way is that there are many different ways to value what bitcoin is worth. Gold is only one of those value cases. And specifically when I talk about gold, again, there was just about the difference in that industrial value abstracting Galloway and then the remainder of the value over time.

Speaker 3:          00:34:17       And so, um, you're right that there are like other things that contribute to the price of gold or a big one. And in fact, um, this goes into something that we're going to talk about later is a, there are a lot of applications I can build on top of bitcoin that contribute to value beyond that just being currency, right? But being a currency. And the value that people hold it as a currency is just one facet of all the different reasons that bitcoin will not value. So that's, yeah, that's a good point. We'll take, we'll take questions just in the interest of time. We have till 1:00 PM. So we'll, we'll, we'll now just batch all, all the questions till the end so we can cover it. Some of the rest of this stuff. Well, let's see. Maybe we don't wonder if be that great. It's 1240. Yeah. Awesome. Cool, cool. Oh Wow. That's fast test.

Speaker 5:          00:34:57       Uh, so, uh, thanks. I think, um, your explanation of why a bitcoin is superior to US dollars or a gold was fantastic. The one like a question I have is about kind of the volatility of like, um, so like if a, a bank run or something like that can really affect the value of US dollar. It seems like there's a lot of events that could also similarly affect the value of a bitcoin, like a different governments making regulations about it, et Cetera. And just like looking at the price of Bitcoin, it's always fluctuating wildly. So how can it be a, how can it be used as a useful form of currency with that being the case?

Speaker 3:          00:35:36       That's a perfect question. So there are a lot of things there that you're talking about. So one is like a yeah, f like a currency is a measure of it's trust, right? Then there are certainly things I can demean that trust over time or damage that trust. And you're exactly right. Like say the u s is like, wait a minute, why do we want people to use bitcoin over the U s dollar? Let's ban bitcoin. And they actually can write, there's central points of vulnerability they could ban exchanges. So the question again is, um, what happens with the volatility of Bitcoin, right? It's like, um, how, how can you have a currency that people trust that people want to use as a global digital daily currency? F They can't believe that's gonna hold its value while, right? Because it keeps going up or it keeps going down and so forth.

Speaker 3:          00:36:12       And so there are two, two ways to answer that question. One actually you can see the volatility is something that has been decreasing dramatically over time. So right now we see swings maybe at most about 20%. Right? But that, that is massive compared to like most currencies. But actually over, it's like at the very beginning, right? You could see bitcoin dropped from like $30 down to $2. Right? Or like a dollar down to like two sons. And so actually right now the volatility that we see in system is far less than it was before. And this will only continue to decrease over time as it gains more adoption. Right? It's just a function of like a small cap versus a large cap. And so that's, that's one part of it. The other part of it though is a, is a really good question that like, um, a lot of people do say even, so even if you have a currency that, um, is just appreciating or like a, the volatility isn't going down.

Speaker 3:          00:36:58       Um, a deflationary currency over time is like a, a bit of a problem as well, that people are encouraged to keep their money as supposed to spend it. And there's some questions there, but then price stability and of itself is a valuable thing, right? Like you can't say one that cup of coffee is one bitcoin today because in 10 years is going to be like $17,000 and you're like, wow, that sucks. Right? Um, but what is interesting is that are actually some solutions around this, right? So how the US government does it is they have central bank and the central bank makes sure that the money always in plates at like two or 3% a year, no matter what happens to the economy, right? And they can do this through two things. They can inflate the money supply when there's more demand for it, right?

Speaker 3:          00:37:33       So when more people have trust in the US dollar, they just print more money. They print like a billion new dollars and they can actually capture that money themselves, right? That's real money that the Princeton about dilutes hunger with loss, right? So that puts the money, the value of the US dollar down. And in the reverse, what they can do is they can actually issue bonds rates to constrict the money supply. So when people lose trust in the US dollar is starting to lose money. What they do is they issue bonds at a yield. And what that does is it reduces the amount of money and the system thereby driving up the price of each us dollar. And actually you can do this in the world today too. So there's an extremely interesting currency that's coming out. It's called base coin and they do exactly that's there an algorithmic central bank.

Speaker 3:          00:38:08       So what that means is they basically buy their algorithm, not through a normal central bank that's controlled by like five people. They are able to say f the money supply grows, you're able to print more money to dilute the my supplies such as the prices have remained stable. And in the case that the money supply, people are losing faith in this thing and they're selling their base coin, they can actually issue bonds the redeemed in chronological order with increasing yields such that you know, f you at any point believe that base coin will remain that's retained its value and like go back to the $1, you know, stable value, then you would be extremely rationally motivated that's buy these bonds because you'll get free yield on it, right when the price goes back, when the trust is remain a retained again in the future you'll just get about 10% more bass coins or something like that.

Speaker 3:          00:38:55       So that's actually, it's very important to find a system that has priced stability, but at the same time you want to capture the value from the growth of that currency over time. Right? So these are like two different things that we're trying to do and the government does this by just saying, don't worry about it. We'll take all the money and you guys don't have to worry about this value. That's appreciated, right? We'll just capture ourselves. But ideally you would like to capture value yourself, right? Like you want your bitcoins to go from $5 today to $17,000 right in the future, but you also want to be able to price things in this currency. Well, how do you solve that one said, well, you can have a system where you can say, for example, this is, this cup of coffee is three bitcoins and three bitcoins are always a dollar and in five years instead you still have, uh, all the value that came from the growth of that currency.

Speaker 3:          00:39:37       Instead, what you have now is it's still three bitcoins is still worth $3, right? Each bitcoin still worth a dollar each in five years inside. Now you just have 17,000 bitcoins that are all worth a dollar each, right? So that's an interesting system where you can have price stability but also still capture value from the growth of the currency over time. So Yup. Yup. And so forth. So yeah. So now basically when we'll jump into is some of the most promising future applications of bitcoin and blockchain technology to, so what we've seen in the past. Yes. These really exciting. Yeah. And I know we're running short on time, so really quickly just for theory and also gets into into some really, really interesting pieces. Turing complete language, amazing in that, that actually for those of you guys that know what I mean, like a theory of high, they EVM, we're just trading Turing complete allows the creation of basically, right.

Speaker 3:          00:40:25       Anything that you could potentially coat up, right? Like in any sort of language you can actually translate into a Theorem, which is one of the coolest things from my end. Viping cause now you can actually have complex interactions that middleman right in market makers are 10 tend to perform right now actually be able to be codafide into smart contracts. Right. And then actually be implemented on the network with some financial base, um, at the back of it. So I think we'll just, we'll skip through this because I knew we were running. So I'll give a quick example of like the, the future potential of what smart contracts can do. So for example, basically what bitcoin has done this, it's disintermediate this middleman, the government, right? The government was what you needed to trust before as a third party that could control and create your money.

Speaker 3:          00:41:07       And you gave them trust because they're trustworthy and they're the only person who can be trustworthy. But now in fact, you, anyone can create their own currency and people can trust it because you know that like it will be to by this code, right? That's exciting. But actually what's more exciting is that you can actually do this with any kind of industry, right? So you can do the same thing. For example, if the legal system, so a smart contract is just a piece of code that dictates what happens. But like on top of it, you know, there's some currency aspect. So let's take an example. Say you want to make a bet with some random person that Donald Trump will remain present, not the end of 2018 right? And so today, if you were to say, let's do this a hundred dollars bet, right? And if you did it with complete random stranger, you wouldn't because you'd have to trust that they would like honor this, right?

Speaker 3:          00:41:47       And so in today's world, right, let's say even if you have a written contract with this random person and you're like, all right, we'll pay each other a hundred dollars based on who wins this fat, right? I think that Donald Trump will be president. You think that they won't. And then at the end of that time say, I'm right, right? And that person's like, oh, nevermind. I don't want pay you. Well, what's your recourse? You'd have to go through the legal system, right? And like the cost and the time of going through the legal system, which is this extremely inefficient kind of middleman that arbitrates all these discussions today is something that would almost certainly be more than like this a hundred dollar battery. So it would never be worthwhile for you to go through our system, therefore you will never be able to make a bet like this, right?

Speaker 3:          00:42:20       So there's huge inefficiency that reduces the ability for us to have all these economic transactions, right? In fact, with a smart contract, we can completely obviate that system, right? We can abstract the way the need to trust this third party to make a bet like this. In fact, we don't have to trust the other part of the law. We don't have to know them. They could be some random person on the internet and we would say, all right, Alison, bomb. They want to make this bet. So both of them agreed to the smart contract, they put their money into the smart contract, it goes into escrow, right? So now the smart contract holds $200 and then at the end of 2018 the smart contract can ping an oracle or source of truth, or there's a game directly secure way for you to actually have an economic like incentive for people to tell you the truth.

Speaker 3:          00:42:56       And then at the end of that time, it just says, all right, Alice won the bet. We send all $200 to Alice, right? So now you can see that you can actually have really interesting things where you reduce a lot of inefficiency and you reduce the need for a middleman to make all these kinds of applications possible. Yup. Yeah, exactly. Well said. Sarah. Fundamental value proposition is abstracting the need like to trust and depend on any given middleman. And that's like, you know, a lot of the core value proposition. For example, if I'm in a lot of the d applications, so d apps that are being developed on top of the Theorem is that you now basically have this currency right in which, right? For example, the code and ether specifically as a currency is being used to actually run the logic within the code, right?

Speaker 3:          00:43:40       They were just like, one of the coolest like paradigms is this idea of a world computer, right? That is now decentralized, transparent in terms of how it functions, um, and allowing people to write these functionalities functions, these applications in the same way. For example, on top of the Internet there are websites and other things created. So this flow information and this flow of logic in particular, this is actually my first foray into cryptocurrency was a theory because it was so exciting from a technical perspective. Um, and see if we actually think about this in down the line, right? We have blockchain, we are actually in code complex pieces of logic, right? In some sort of right way through solidity and through smart contracts. I'm actually able to exit a lot of this stuff. What can we do with that, you know, as a result. Right? And I think for those of you have been following with the ICO space and a lot of crypto projects, um, this actually opens up some really, really interesting doors in terms of what people can do on top of something like a ethereum during Erc

Speaker 4:          00:44:32       20 token rate, which is like kind of the standard in terms of tokens that are built on top of the ethereum chain. So using the theory on blockchain to, to exit specific things, um, as well as like, you know, other doctrines that have come. So in particular, what we're going to do is actually take stream what we're working on, um, as a, as a somewhat of a case studies terms, thinking about actual value accrued in a lot of these crypto parties.

Speaker 3:          00:44:51       So we were going to get to their questions too. So I'm going to actually just do a very quick explanation of all the things that are relevant in like what is an exciting use of, uh, watching technology that we see. And then, you know, if you guys want to learn more about anything, just less less, no one questions, you guys have some very specifically, what's the fascinating thing now is we basically democratize the creation of money, right? There's no longer a domain of a monopoly. So specifically the monopolies I could before create money or governments, right? They're the only ones who had the trust that people would place to be able to create money. Now anyone can do it. So what can you do with that? Well, you can actually do things, for example, like make sector specific currencies. What's extremely interesting about that. And what I mean by that is a currency that specifically just tracks one industry or one sector or one economy.

Speaker 3:          00:45:33       For example, in our case, we're tracking video streaming or content distribution. Well, what can you do in that case, what you can do to extremely interesting things. One, you can shield that currency from global volatility. So right now, for example, there are many different factors that impact the price of a US dollar, right? Maybe oil prices fall somewhere in the world, or like they rise or something. And like that impacts you even if you have nothing to do with oil, right? Even if you have nothing to do with the economic policy of the government and so forth, right? You're in like, you're just like a video maker, right? They're like, why am I being impacted by this? We'll actually, no, you don't have to be, right? You can have a currency that specifically is valued based on that's use case in a specific industry such that the other fascinating thing that happens here is you have incentive alignment within this industry where we can create strong motivations to, uh, create a virtuous cycle of increasing network effects.

Speaker 3:          00:46:21       And so what I mean by that is no, you can create the currency that people all directly benefit from when they gross such that you're highly motivated to make this industry go. So let's take a very simple example. So we have say a stream token, right? So let's say we created this currency. We have 100,000 streams tokens, it's a completely finite number, right? And let's say for example, in our case, right? The use cases are like live streaming tips. It's a $5 billion industry right now, or Patriot loss models and so forth, right? People sending money from users to concentrators. So say people convert there, other currencies into this currency, you use it for those cases. Now people have come here with $100,000 of that, those currencies. So now we have 100,000 streams, logins, $100,000 as a market cap. So you are the expect each stream token has about a dollar value, but oh yeah, perfect.

Speaker 3:          00:47:05       And now let's say this grows over time, right? There's more people want to use this currency for the goods and services I can provide. We now have saved. The thing grows too. In my example, I'll just say $500,000 right? So now we have 100,000 stream tokens, a market cap of $500,000 that's about $5 per token. And this is the naive model that's a bitcoin takes, right? It's just that you capture the value from the growth for the US economy by basically having each unit of value be worth more over time. That's actually not the most interesting thing that you can do. What you can do in this case is actually similar to what central bank can do. You can emit more tokens. So let's say we actually met 400,000 new tokens. So now we have $500,000 in this economy. We have five and 2000 tokens.

Speaker 3:          00:47:45       So we don't change the size of the economy by printing more tokens. But over time, discounting velocity of money, you are the imagined that it would revert to this fundamental mean where we have a dollar per token stove, right? You have 500,000 tokens, $500,000 but we have literally created $400,000 of real new money, right? So what can we do with that? Well, interestingly enough, we can distribute that back to everyone who has contributed to the growth in this economy over time to incentivize them to grow the economy. So let's say we split this in the most simple way. We could split 50 50 right? We take 200,000 of these new tokens that we made with $200,000 of real value. We give it to everyone who held tokens today. So if you had one stream token for dollar, now you have three stream tokens worth a dollar each, but three times as much.

Speaker 3:          00:48:23       But we also have $200,000 of new money that we created, and now that money, we can actually distribute back to say constant creators, right? The people who have made these videos such a, now they have a revenue stream without any direct costs to users that incentivizes them strongly such that if you have say a million views, you would just possibly, if you have like 50% of the views of everyone on the spot, what to say, right? You have $100,000 that we give you in stream tokens for free, right? For having contributed to that network effect. So you can strongly in gender or someone wanting to contribute to that network. In fact, over time, and so now we've created a new revenue stream that basically was once the domain of just governments, right? It's a silent tax and everyone who holds US dollars day is a, if you take the u s dollar, you would see that the US economy does keep growing over time, right?

Speaker 3:          00:49:06       So as the u s economy kept growing over time, if you have a finite supply of US dollars, you are the imagine that each year scholars should have more buying power over time, but doesn't, right? It actually depreciates by about 2% or 3% every year. And the reason for that is because while that value has to be going somewhere, right, someone must be capturing that value and it's the government, right? When they print more money, they captured themselves. And for the first time we have an opportunity to actually distribute that back to the people who are actually responsible for the growth for that economy over time. It's not just one real quick thing. There's a lot more to it, but yeah, while open up for questions, you guys have anything you want to dive in more detail? Yeah. So what are the biggest risks for cryptocurrencies? Yeah, that's a great question.

Speaker 3:          00:49:44       So personally my philosophy is this, right? I see that. Um, oh, that's a great question. Yeah. What are the biggest risks for cryptocurrencies today? So there are a lot of things that can happen and it is, um, a lot of them, I would consider it to be black swan events that are almost inevitable in the short term, but in the long term. So what we can see is, um, I actually considered cryptocurrency to be, um, this concept of expected value, right? Like plus or minus expected value. It's a term that's often used in poker, right? So in poker it's basically a dilatation of probability. It's like no. I would say maybe even if bitcoin has a 90% chance of failure, it can be a good bet for you to put some of your money into f in that 10% that succeeds, you expect to succeed more than 10 x, right?

Speaker 3:          00:50:25       Then that's a positive expected value. But so let's see, what are those things that could cause it the hub? No, I actually do believe that's still, it's an extremely high risk speculative investment. Right? And so that's sort of, again, it may be worth your money played being pulled into this thing if you believe that the expected value is over that. So in the short term, this is why I don't day trade, right? I think it's actually easier to see and predict what possibilities they coin may have in the for the long term than the short term. What this world of the media things that can happen. For example, what are the things that actually caused the price of bitcoin and ethereum and all these things to drop the most? There are black swan events that happened that you fundamentally can't predict. You can have pretty good assurance over time that they will happen, but you don't know when they'll happen.

Speaker 3:          00:51:05       So for example, in 2013 the price of bitcoin went all the way up to 20 a $1,200 and then the creative immediately because Mt Gox was hacked, right? Mt. Gox lost hundreds of millions of dollars that immediately made the price fall and become stagnant for the next three years, right? They went all the way down to less than $200. So over 80% or 85% fell. And for example, another thing happened with the Dow. So ethereum again, has all these enormous potential, uh, applications and that you can create smart contracts, smart contracts. Again, those Turing complete code, that code can basically do anything. So for example, they have this concept of these centralized autonomous organizations. So Take Uber, for example, right? Uber is a company that technically it's a company today, but it's really just code, right? There's no reason you can adjust, have this code via Turing complete thing that you put into the blockchain and they would just run by itself and you wouldn't even need a company to run it, right?

Speaker 3:          00:51:52       They would just be decentralized and autonomous who'd run by itself. And so the first concept was this thing that they created that was called the Dow, right? There was like self names and there was an investment funds and they said everyone put your money into the dao and we're going to have you all vote on where you want this money to be invested. And they thought this was a good idea. I'm a little skeptical but you know they put $150 million into this thing and people were super excited but it didn't even cross because like they made bad investments. It failed because someone found that code is law, right? But curve is fallible. Curve is written by humans that can make mistakes. And so the code had an exploit where someone could actually siphon the funds directly into child doubt, right? And like basically control of themselves.

Speaker 3:          00:52:31       And so they were like, holy crap, this is terrible. Atherium was rising all the way up to $22 at that point. And then the Dow had this hack, right? Someone stole $50 million and it actually has a hard fork. All the doubts and re uh, Re uh, retrieved the funds. But in that time etherium fell down to $7. Right? So in the short term, those are the existential risks I see. Right? Regulation can happen, right? China's size, we banned all ics that creatives market, the u s is like, Yo, we're going to ban exchanges, right? That craters market. Those are all the short term existential risks that we see. Maybe some of those are long, large enough that they, you know, so far damaged the trust in bitcoin. That doesn't get to long term. But actually I think these are all things that like you can't predict window happened or how though happens or any of those things.

Speaker 3:          00:53:10       They're just like a inextricably tied to, you know, just like uncertainty and the sorts, everybody in the long term actually I think, um, there are the only, like the big risks is that some like the governments or something, right? Like trying to tackle this thing and talk it so far that like, um, it doesn't get off the ground or they replace it or say quantum computing for example, like technically the house function that protects bitcoin is something that isn't computationally impossible to reverse engineer. It just computationally hard. There's no technical technology today that can say like, we can reverse engineer a cryptographic one way hash function easily, but in the future, maybe with constant Peter's, it'd be really trivial for us to, you know, brute force, that solution. So those are things that can happen, but also at the same time, um, the code itself can be modified over time. Right. So I'm can fork it and just have a system that's resistant.

Speaker 5:          00:54:01       Yeah. It seems pretty hard to make kind of obvious decisions. Yup.

Speaker 3:          00:54:08       Yeah, yeah. Yeah. That's a great question. Thanks. Yeah. So basically it seems like it's pretty hard to come to consensus in the bitcoin community, right? So how are decisions made? And that's a great question. And actually this is a difference between the lot of different systems or a bitcoin itself specifically has a hard time consuming coming to consensus because there's no clear leader. So this is the Toshi knock and Barlow made the coin and then think just left, right? Like at some point. And he's like, all right, like it seems like this thing's taken off. I only have to be here anymore. So he's no longer there. So what happens now is that there are a lot of ideological splits and camps that now have influence over bitcoin. And in fact, so there are people who have real influence. And then there are people who are like these, uh, like leaders, right?

Speaker 3:          00:54:49       Thought leaders in the case. So for example, this is what happened very recently. Um, a huge question was the scaling debate. So bitcoin is now actually reasonably expensive to use for small micro transactions. And the reason for that, and it's because the blockchain is actually an incredibly inefficient system to, uh, convey information because it's something that's replicated across every single computer that is a full node, right? And so you want to keep this ideally as small as possible. And so right now, all blocks are limited to being one megabyte in size. And this is a huge problem in some some, uh, philosophies because it means that there are only a tiny amount of transactions that can be fit in each block and they'd give him point. And specifically miners are rationally self interested in accepting transactions. I paid them the most money. So with every transaction you spend, you signed, you can specify how much money you want to go as a reward to minors.

Speaker 3:          00:55:37       And of course, if they can only fit a finite number in here, they're going to fit the ones I paid them the most money, right? So that means that now transactions, if you want them to happen quickly, they take a lot of money. It's a lot of people were like, well, this is a huge problem. While we saw that with the most intuitive solution, which has just increased the block size, right? So that's what happened with bitcoin cash. There are a lot of these people who are like, well, this is obvious. Let's just make the block size larger, right? Let's go from one megabytes to eight megabytes and that's going to be sufficient to solve this transactional problem. But a lot of people also think that this is a short term shortsighted solution, right? Because it makes the problem go away right now, but it's not going to make the problem go away forever because you know, increasing the blockchain is something that's going to be finite and as more transactions happen, it's still going to be a problem in the future.

Speaker 3:          00:56:16       So you're basically kicking the bucket down the road at the same time. It also makes the blockchain so large, right? It makes it eight times as large going such that it will be much more difficult for it to be decentralized for people to be able to actually hold enough data to make this possible. And so what happened in this case as it was extremely difficult to come to consensus because there is no one clear person who was a spiritual leader, right? Take an example for ethereum where when the Dow hack happens, actually within a month they hard forks, right? And they actually made the new currency that reverse that transaction because there was clear, uh, leaders, right? Like Vitalik was like, all right, like I made this thing, right. I think this is the right decision. People followed him and believes in very strongly with bitcoin.

Speaker 3:          00:56:55       There's Bitcoin core, right? There are these core developers that like technically contribute to the code, but they don't actually have that much power, right? Because they contribute to code. But the people who have a lot of power are miners, right? Because they're the people who actually provide the security behind the system. And so those people are actually very rationally interested in increasing the block size change size. Because the alternative solution that people are proposing right now is the lightening network. So the lightening network, for example, is an off chain second layer solution. So what we mean by that is transactions they take, the philosophy of transactions on the blockchain are always going to be inherently limited in size, right? We can't possibly fit every single transaction you ever want on the blockchain. So instead, why don't we just take transactions off the blockchain and the make extremely cheap, extremely fast, uh, transactions on the, off the blockchain possible.

Speaker 3:          00:57:39       And so what you do now is you opened basically war called payment channels and how you open the payment channel to say Alison, Bob, right? They want to send money back to each other. So they have $100 each. They do a multisignature transaction. So they both agreed to basically, uh, put one transaction on the blockchain. So they put, um, they both signed this reduction, they put $100 in this thing, they opened a payment channel, and then in that payment channel, what they can do is they can send money, if only back and forth to each other in the form of ics without closing this on the blockchain itself without paying any costs. So maybe they paid $3, right? So let's make this first transaction that goes on the blockchain and then in the future, say Alice is like, Oh, I owe you some dollars for like a Uber ride, right?

Speaker 3:          00:58:17       So she pays $7 to Bob and now their balances updates such an Alice now has $93 in this Iou, right? And Bob has $107, right? And they can sign, say a thousand transactions back and forth on this IOU thing before suddenly in blockchain doesn't matter, right? Because as long as they both have some none, zero balance rate, they can keep sending money back and forth and then say a thousand transactions live, they finally decide to close this thing. They pay another like $3 right? To actually finally settle. It's like Allison's up with $50 in. Bob Ends up with 150 they sell it on the blockchain and now they've only paid for two transactions on the blockchain. Even if they sent a thousand transactions back and forth to each other, right? And this actually can scale because you can have nodes that connect to other nodes. Even if you don't have a direct connection from the other party.

Speaker 3:          00:58:57       Say Bob is connected with Kathy, right? And like Alice now can send money to Kathy through Bob even if they don't have a direct connection. So through hubs you can basically send money to anyone through the system and you really uh, solve kind of this a problem with like on changers actions. You just move most of transactions off chain. And so the problem is this is a solution that makes a lot of sense to a lot of the people because it is a like longterm cited solution that will like obviate the problem with like we always need to keep increasing the block size but is against the rational self interest and minors. Right? Because my, there is don't make any money when you do off change his actions, they only make money when you put transactions on the blockchain, right? And so of course they want all the transactions to stay on the blockchain. So that's why they were the advocate for say an eight docs bunching size. Right? And so because there are these like mal lines, economic incentives, it's really hard to come to consensus even beyond the fact that there's no, uh, economic leader. So it is a problem.

Speaker 5:          00:59:49       Yeah. I think I saw you as hers a little bit. Exactly. Is it de facto? I mean, I, I find it, that'd be, yeah. The other incentives, like it doesn't have to be a government want to go.

Speaker 3:          01:00:26       Yeah. So that's a great question. So basically you're right. Like bitcoin itself is inherently scarce in the sunset. Like bitcoins will not increase the value, but people can just make many different other currencies. So that was the question is like, is it really scarce? Are cryptocurrencies really scarce? Because you can just have infinitely many different cryptocurrencies and that's actually correct. Right? Well, it's the same reason that like, you know, um, gold for example, no one has to use gold, right? There are many other elements that we could use as a store of value, but people don't use those. Right? So ultimately it comes down to what trusts do people have in these other currencies are created. And the fact that bitcoin itself has been forked thousands of times, right? And like the vast majority of those forks technically are indistinguishable from bitcoin but have no value, right?

Speaker 3:          01:01:05       Because people have in place on the trust in it. So the real question is, will people actually wants a place trust in something else that's not bitcoin itself? And Yeah, you're absolutely right. Maybe there are forced utility use cases, like you say, right? All these banks or consortium of like retailers get together and they were like, in order to use Amazon, you have to use Amazon point or something like that, right? And then that give us like some force utility to people wanting to use US system. And that's certainly a possibility, right? Certainly other cryptocurrencies have value, right? Like right now, bitcoin's worth under $70 billion. The total market is like $300 billion, right? So clearly people want to put faith in other currencies about the same time, right? It is scarce, right? Bitcoin itself is scarce. And as long as people want to trust Bitcoin, and there are a lot of the reasons that you actually want to trust bitcoin because one, like, sure, they have the first mover advantage, right?

Speaker 3:          01:01:50       They already have a large body of trust, but also something needs to be a lot better than bitcoin to actually replace it on like this a reason trust, right? Like if someone made exactly the same bitcoin, there's no reason for someone to want to do that. Right? So then the question is, is there anything that can be a lot better than bitcoin? I think that is, um, that's really up to birds debate and I think there's a lot of, uh, evidence for that not being the case. It's, um, bitcoin, like people say, for example, ethereum is a really easy case of like, of course people want to use the theory because it's so much more useful, right? Like you can program anything you want on it. It can be for almost any of these applications. You can make the Amazon coin on top of it, right?

Speaker 3:          01:02:22       You can make an Erc 20 token that lives on top of ethereum. So why would someone want to use bitcoin? Well, actually there are a lot of trade offs, right? With all of these things. Bitcoin takes very few promises. Bitcoin promises to be a currency that works really well. You theory and makes an enormous amount promises and each of those promises is something that can damage trust if they don't fulfill that promise. So specifically you can actually have smart contracts as a second layer on top of the coin itself. So you can have a risk smart contract that I'm works basically the same as like Ethiopian smart contracts would, but etherium has designed that to be part of its base layer, right? So the scripting language, free theory, Ms Turing, complete audience base layer, this is really bad for a lot reasons, possibly because the scripting language can be very poorly written.

Speaker 3:          01:03:03       And uh, it can be like very subject to more exploits and vulnerabilities and bitcoin itself would, right? Because bitcoin is kept the tax space very small. And so for example, if we're hearing, we've actually seen this happen a lot of times, or there's a Perry, the multisite hack that happened recently where they lost like $150 million, right? And that was because the guy, this is lower, the guy who made the etherium yellow paper, right? He basically created the scripting language on ethereum called solidity, right? And he used to prepare the, but the, the scripting language like is not that well written to be very secure, such that like he introduced a very simple bug basically where, uh, he called you, you wanna like initialize a library function and like you want to save on gas costs, you reuse the same code over and over again. So he initialized this library.

Speaker 3:          01:03:48       But in the library there's a function that you could call that would basically, uh, reinitialize a wallet and assign a new owner to this wallet. And so of course, this is a function that you only want to be able to call once, right? To start this thing. And then no other person should be able to be able to call this function method. But unfortunately what he did was he wrote this code and he didn't realize that he actually put an edge case in this code where it said if you send money, this is to create a multisig wallet. So if you guys are familiar with multisig wallet is a wallet where you can have multiple owners such that you have three, say three out of five people need to sign a transaction before it actually goes live. And so in this case, it's supposed to be the most secure thing ever, right?

Speaker 3:          01:04:28       Because like you don't have one central point of failure, you have like five different points of failure. So it's a lot more robust. But in fact you could just circumvent this whole system if you actually have to. Code itself is vulnerable, right? And so that's what happened because he had an exception handler where it was a very friendly exception handler. It said basically that f you tried to call a function that wasn't defined in the code for the multisig itself. Don't worry about it. We'll actually search our libraries and see if the function is called there. Right? And so, uh, if the function is defined there, then we'll just call it for you. So then someone just like called these like multisig wallets and like call the function to reinitialize wall and sign themselves as the owner and just went through. Right. And so that's a problem with like maybe having more functionality on top of like bit coin itself. Just as one example for why bitcoin actually is like a very well done system that may be hard for something as supersede.

Speaker 4:          01:05:18       I actually don't. So I actually disagree with Ben on some of this stuff. Um, I think so from my perspective, I think I, with the scarcity, um, I mean I think that the engineering problem, I think for example, having a currency as a store of value right there, there is a lot in the same way that gold is function, there is a lot of value within that. Um, I actually think like, man, this is like giving the incentive alignment. We have minors, different different reasons for different parts of Bitcoin to evolve. Um, it's actually really interesting it also thinking about presenting the proof of work right now. Right now, what that's led to is just giant mining farms, for example, in China and other places in which there's been an enormous amount of computational power spent generating random numbers that has no real utility or value.

Speaker 4:          01:05:58       Right. In the same way, like for example, if you look at it [inaudible] case, um, the differences that you're actually using computational power density run code on the network. So I think it's interesting, I, I from my perspective is that I think blocked like there is going to be a solution, whether it's Bitcoin, inevitably I think it has the clear first mover advantage, but I think you know better, for example, proof of like better proof of whatever it might be. Um, systems might actually end up becoming better then you might have you taken, how does that evolve? Like I think this is all up in the air, um, in terms of what there's so much innovation going to happen and Bitcoin is just one that we all know and we think, um, but whether it becomes a clear winner in the long run, like, right. I think there's, there's a lot of debate clearly right around a lot of this stuff that's happening and what technologies can be better. So this is something, but it's, I think once that, one takeaway is that they're like, scarcity is important in terms of people trusting within the currency, but there are clearly problems with what we have already and there's going to clearly need to be innovative solutions to scaling going forward. Um, yeah,

Speaker 3:          01:06:56       I grew up fat. Right. It's not a binary system. It's not like when they're takes all right. There's certainly room for many different players and specifically because there are tradeoffs with every system that you would implement. Yeah. There are two systems that may work for different purposes, right?

Speaker 5:          01:07:09       Yup, Yup. Yeah. We can do, if you think of all the, Yup, Yup, Yup, Yup. Totally getting the approvers of Bitcoin or I can put it in cool switch that holds a on the paper it or like try to remember it in my head's like, Yup, it's like die those goons, all this, whatever. So absolutely, absolutely perfect way to score and I know exactly what you are. That's great. Sure. No one takes my backpack right there.

Speaker 3:          01:07:55       Well, anyway, yeah. So very specifically to your, to your point, that's a great question. So the question again was, you know, security seems like a trade off with Bitcoin, right? Because those fundamental value proposition is you own your own money, but with great power comes great responsibility, right? If you control your own money, then it's hard to spend and if you spend it, it can be compromised. Like all these things, you can lose your own coins, you can lose your private keys. So status should you keep it on like an exchange, right? Like which takes analog of a bank, but then, you know, the bank had just like lose its money or like go out of business or get hacked itself and all these things. There are these fundamental trade off. So that's a great question. I would venture to say that that actually is something that today is, um, certainly in its nascent form, right?

Speaker 3:          01:08:31       I really do say as like analogous to the Internet in 1995, right? There was like a clunky, terrible thing that was extremely difficult for most people lose, right? Like any grandmother now can use Facebook because you pressed some buttons, right? And then works or Google or youtube. But like back then, and it's like you have to understand how https works or TCP Ip and like a right curve then like a terminal command line, right? And that's the same thing with the system today, right? Like you have to understand how the keep your cryptographic private key secure, right? How the sunlight's and some random heck story. Now just write what that even means and all this stuff. And so you're absolutely right. It is a problem today and it's very scary. But even today we can already see good solutions coming out, right? So there's this fundamental question that you have with like, you know, cold storage versus hots, this hot storage, right?

Speaker 3:          01:09:09       So hot wallet is something that touches the air and that you assume that anything that communicates with the year and that is fundamentally compromised because Erin has a fundamentally insecure layer, right? So the most secure thing that people do is you keep your money on something that has never touched you in that, right? So what you can do is, for example, you have a laptop that you never do anything with near enough for. You just download the program on it and like you generate your random, you know, private key and public key pair, and then you put your money in there and then you never touch it. So no one on the end that could possibly steal this money. But that's extremely arduous, hard to like use. And someone could like steal your laptop or your laptop burns off burst and blue like that, right? And it's gone.

Speaker 3:          01:09:44       And so the actually today we can already see some alternatives. So while I personally use, for example, our hardware wallets, so hall Grunewald solve this problem. Well, because it's basically an air gap system that does allow you to use the money, but also keep it secure and away from the Internet. So the two largest ones are Tresor and ledger nano s and they take two different purchase to it. But let's talk about the treasure. So trezor is beautiful because what it does is it's basically a hardware, uh, piece of thing that you actually hold that actually stores your private keys on it. And then what it does is you connected through like micro Usb to your computer. But um, the private keys, we'll never be transmitted to the actual internet or you know, your computer or anything like that because all you actually have to do to send the transaction these, you have to sign a transaction you wear for your private key.

Speaker 3:          01:10:29       You don't have to transmit the private key yourself. So what it does is it actually signs the transaction. So what you do is use software on your computer and it's like, all right, let's send $1,000 to some random address, right? And then it's like, all right, let's send this transaction to your life or your treasure. It sends it to treasure. And then on the treasury side, all has to do as a scientist transaction on the treasury itself and then ascends the signature to your computer, but never send your private key, right? So again, now you have a system where you have to think that's aircraft that is, uh, safe in of itself directly at least, right? But that you're able to use every day for sending transactions. So that's, you know, that's one example. Again, multisignature [inaudible] are another example, right? It's something where you have control of yourself over this thing and yet you have like a multiple points of failure, right?

Speaker 3:          01:11:10       It's not just like you lose your one thing and you know, it's all gone, right? You can do multiple things there. And even so like, um, I think over time, realistically if this becomes adopted as a global curtsy, we'll see even more security measures in place. For example, Coinbase has insurance on all their hot wallets, right? So actually I do keep some of my coins on coin base. My whole thesis is don't keep all your eggs in one basket, right? So I keep telling about my treasure. I keep some of my ledger, I keep some in Coinbase and all over all of these places because coin base, maybe they, they like this is their job, right? To keep this money secure. Chances are they're doing a much better job of it then like I myself could like replicate. And so for example, what they do, right?

Speaker 3:          01:11:46       It's like they actually do Samir [inaudible] secret sharing. They split up all their private keys into like multiple redundant parts and no one employee or no one person has control over each of these parts. But like, um, they put them in like safe deposit bags all over the world and like, it would be extremely difficult for someone to be able to actually find each of these and take the money. So they have that as a cold storage solution. And then for their hot wallet solution, because in exchange must necessarily have some coins touch the ear in that, right? So how they do that? Well, they just insure it, right? So they actually have Lloyd's of London that ensures all their hot wallet things such a, you have that security in place. Right? So I think overtime solutions will happen. They're no key points. What's diversify the I just really quick, um, yeah, use, use it as a bunch of different solutions. Storage and harbor wallets tends to be the same as I use the ledger nano, personally. Yeah. Just really quick. Yeah. Thank you, Ben. That simmer
