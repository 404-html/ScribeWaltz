Speaker 1:          00:00:05       Uh, but today we have a very exciting speaker here. I'll funds out to Villa Alfonzo and he's here from ames. He's been with Ames about 10 years and this just recently become a civil servant. And before that was a contractor with Seti working at aims. So, um, he is currently in the exobiology branch of Nasa Ames, uh, looking at terrestrial analog environments to assess the potential, how about habitability of other planetary bodies and developing strategies for life detection based on first principles in biology and biochemistry. Currently he conducts field investigations in the most extreme deserts on earth, provide scientific advice for the maturation of instruments of space exploration and helps develop mission concepts to surf search for as evidence of life on Mars, Europa. And, and so I'm selling this and sell it us. Yes. Thank you. Name. Yes. I'll know it really well. So, um, please help me welcome. I'll find them.

Speaker 2:          00:01:06       Thank you. Thanks for [inaudible]. We're calming

Speaker 3:          00:01:08       and thanks. Everybody was listening on the radio waves. Um, the, um, I'm, I'm happy to be here and share some of the latest thinking that our group has been developing at NASA ames in terms of the search for life, specifically the search for a second genesis of life. So, uh, to begin with, I'll tell you what the motivation is for me to be here here. Meaning aims studying these, these specific topics and the way we do it that way. When I first landed at Ames 10 years ago, uh, my mentor back then gave me the most important advice that I've received in my career. And he said, the most important question in science, you always have to keep asking yourself is why every time you make a decision, you decide to do something as yourself. Why? And that applies to the questions you're asking, how you're addressing them, why you're addressing them that way, why that experiment, why their observation.

Speaker 3:          00:01:57       So it's constant. Why, why, why it takes us today to the kind of topic did we were talking and discussing. And it's, as you will see, there's still a lot of that needs to be done. But why is the [inaudible] a question behind all these now itself, this, this question itself, it leads to a self doubt and longterm psychological damage, but that's secondary. As long as your science is good, he said, ah, your papers are going to be solid. Just keep asking why. And so, uh, really in asking why are we searching for a sec? Why are we searching for life in the first place? Why should we water? Uh, and then, uh, starting to go down the uh, the uh, chain of reasoning, the chain of logic. A lot of these you're going to see today that's, that's what came out of these, these kind of asking why now this is probably the best reason why we should bother about, we should care about searching for a second genesis of life.

Speaker 3:          00:02:48       And some of you might sympathize with the concept is the zero one infinity rule is the idea that things, there are three shapes, free forms and things can exist in the universe. Uh, either they don't or they unique are, there is many of them really to, there's no such thing as two things in the universe. And so right now we are uh, pause the zero. There's live on earth. So we know there is a loose one example in our equation, in our equation of life in the universe. The question is whether it's the unique one or there is infinite forms of life and it only takes one other, in my opinion, form of life out there that shares does not share in origin with live on earth to conclude that there is infinite forms of life in the universe that's only based on the sheer number of exoplanets there are.

Speaker 3:          00:03:33       We know that are out there and how many of those we know have likely the right conditions to support life. Now, I'm not going to focus on exit planets today cause it turns out that our own solar system already has plenty of places where life could actually potentially exist. The places that in fact a microorganism micro organisms on earth will be able to not only survive those environments were actually thrive in them. We're going to run through some of those examples today. So the motivation is very simple, fine. Another example of life so that we can convince ourselves that life isn't actually, it's an actual cosmic phenomenon. It's not something that happened once accidentally on our planet. And so what we're looking for, as I just said right now, there is an example of one, there's no escaping that that motivates the search. It also limits the way we search because our knowledge is based on these one example of life in the universe and as scientist we've been struggling for many years on going from a data number of one to what the, all the rent to cover all of the possible range of all the possible, all the possibilities for life outside of the planet.

Speaker 3:          00:04:40       Obviously you're continuously being limited and constrained by your understanding of what you know. And in this case, what we know is only one live on earth. The, despite all its diversity, when you look at it from the mentally at the chemical level of life on earth is very non diverse. It's very, uh, it's all very similar. We'll talk about this in a second. Now what we, what we really mean by a second. Genesis of life is exactly this, a form of life not related to live on earth. Now this is a simple statement but it's not clear to a lot of people and including a lot of researchers. What the meaning of a second genesis really means release. Uh, something that is not related to us. It's not something that easy to, uh, it's not a question that easy to address. Okay. What's next? So I'm going to go with for a number of places I just told you in the secondary is lots of examples.

Speaker 3:          00:05:31       Now we know of many exoplanets that are at the right distance from their parents, started with liquid water, could be stable on the surface that's great for exobiology, but we're actually interested or I am actually interested in the possibility of life in the solar system. Not for anything but the, but because of the fact that any form of life nor in the solar system, it's almost irrelevant to us. We will never be able to look at it. We will never be able to interact with it in a direct manner. Just because of the enormous distance between the, uh, all different stars. Only a form of life in our solar system outside of the earth could help us really understand the basic principles of life could help us develop a theory of life because that's a form of light we could dissect, we could break apart, we could analyze in detail at the same way we are.

Speaker 3:          00:06:16       We analyze life on earth, life on an exoplanet. Awesome. But other than we know it's there, it wouldn't really help as advanced scientifically much, uh, about the understanding of life and, and the, and the way life originated and all these interesting questions that motivates the search. Now, it turns out that there, there is a certain, there is a fair number of places in the solar system that we could potentially think about searching for evidence of life. The first one that comes to mind is present day, Maurice. Um, we know for a fact that Mars is not, it's not a habitable planet today. Anything we know, any form of life we know of would die on the surface of Mars. Almost immediately need to exposure of either toxic chemistry in the soil or UV radiation. Uh, not, not to speak about the cold temperatures and all that nasty stuff, but we know that conditions on the surface of Mars do change with time, just like conditions on the earth.

Speaker 3:          00:07:10       There are ice ages on Mars, same way that there are ice ages and earth triggered by changes in the earth, orbital parameters of the planet, and we know that only five to 10 million years ago conditions on the surface of Mars, we're actually warming off to meld some of these occurrences of ground dies very close to the surface. These an impact crater on the surface of Mars. That happened very recently. It was actually captured in 2008 there is a number of documented cases like this. It was small, but it was big enough to excavate some of these white stuff and these white stuff turns out to be water ice very close to the surface. And some of these craters are fun here in the mid latitudes of Mars. Actually Vl to here is the Viking to landing site. Viking might've missed ground eyes only by about 10 centimeters.

Speaker 3:          00:07:54       Uh, back in 1975 research Mars exploration would have been a lot different if biking had excavated a tiny bit deeper into the soil. But the bottom line is that, uh, at these low latitudes, there is examples of ground dies is very close to the surface, less than one meter. These ground eyes can get warming off, uh, during high obliquity periods for these, uh, for these to melt and generate conditions that it leads, could be transiently habitable. So it's a very interesting place to search for possible evidence of life. Now I like to think of Mars as actually a tale of two planets. Um, early Mars was a very different planet. I think of it as different, in fact, as a different planet. And the way we, we might want to search for life in that plan is different. The way we would search for life on Mars today.

Speaker 3:          00:08:42       We know now based on data from the curiosity rover that there were legs of Mars about three and a half billion years ago, that those lakes would have been habitable to lifeforms to live the life forms that exist today on the earth. Even to us. We could drain that water. The Ph was okay. The saltiness was okay, the composition was fine. There was nothing in that water will prevent life from growing it. It had all their, all their requirements, nutrients and energy sources to grow and reproduce that existed on the planet three and a half billion years ago. There is evidence that there were many such examples of habitable environments on the surface. In fact, people have proposed the existence of a large northern ocean, uh, in the northern hemisphere of Mars occupying a big portion off the planet surface. Uh, and now we have rovers.

Speaker 3:          00:09:26       The MSL curiosity rover is studying these sediments, which was the positive in that lake environment, searching for possible chemical signatures of habitability. And eventually if a either get lucky, maybe chemical signatures of life. Uh, a big, a very important first step was the discovery of organic matter reserved in those sediments. Organics is, we will see is probably the first requirement you need as a scientist to decide to go searching for life on a place just because the basic fact that life is made of organic matter. And so we do have the Mars Science Laboratory mission currently studying these environments. The exomars, the European lender is going to go to Mars in 2020 around 2020 kept getting delayed but hopefully 2020 is the last one. Uh, it's equipped to search for evidence of light using several instruments. Mars 2020 is another NASA mission. There is being prepared for a to return to Mars and maybe would be the first step towards a sample return mission.

Speaker 3:          00:10:21       That will be the first mission that would cash a sample or a number of samples and would wait for a future mission to bring those samples back to Earth for study. So one possible place to for Mars 2020 to land would be one of those ancient lake deposits. So lots of exciting things coming up. Now a lot of, most of the public is familiar with this stuff. This is not new, but what's been developing in the last few years is the concept of ocean worlds. Europa, you probably know about that one. That's the moon of Jupiter. We know for a fact or as much of a fact you can get without seeing it directly. A Europa has an ocean and there an ice cover of about 90 kilometers, 50 of 60 miles. Uh, that ocean, it's, it's been busted, let him pretty much since the Galileo missions one was 30 or 40 years ago.

Speaker 3:          00:11:08       But now there is plenty of good evidence based on morphology and the surface that there is in fact an ocean of liquid water under the ice shell and that ocean is probably about a hundred kilometers deep. There's plenty of a water down there. Recently, there was indications of the plume of water vapor ejecting from the surface of the planet that could be linked to the subsurface ocean, although that hasn't been demonstrated or validated yet. It's just one observation. Now these obviously makes it a very interesting place for life or shouldn't liquid water, uh, deep far away from nasty radiation. That could be an interesting place to go. Unfortunately technologically is really hard to get there. Now the astrobiology community, the planetary science community in general has been always interested in landing on the surface of Europa. Uh, for many we thought it will take a not of God to actually do that technologically is vacant picketed.

Speaker 3:          00:11:58       It turns out it would be, it, it, it, it actually it was worth more than that. It actually took an act of Congress for us to go to the surface of Europa. But last year Congress actually provided some decks demanding or asking NASA to actually put together a mission to land on the surface of Europa in the next decade and not only the land but also to search for life. That got everybody very intrigued, very excited. And there is currently a, there's going to be a call for instruments at the end of this year, early next year for the community to propose instruments that would logo on that lender and that would probably land on Europa hopefully, uh, within the next 10 years. And they would go to a place on the surveys, probably one of these caves regions, which morphologically they look like it's actually upwelling of ground water from the ocean going all the way through the ice cover and then freezing on the surface.

Speaker 3:          00:12:49       So it will be a mission that without accessing directly the ocean would still might still be able to analyze ocean materials. It's very exciting mission. Now there is another exciting place in the solar system that's titan. That's a moon of Saturn. Titan is very interesting because it's very alien. It's probably the most alien place in the solar system in the sense that it's very different from everything else. It's a moon of a fairly large sizes, the largest moon of Saturn. Uh, but the interesting thing about titan are these spots on the surface, mostly in the northern hemisphere of the moon, which our lakes, but they're not legs of water, their legs of hydrocarbon, they're mostly made off matte liquid methane, liquid ethane. That's what makes the moon interesting. An alien at the same time, it's because there's nothing really, there is about these days familiar to us. Liquid methane happens at man, it's 150 degrees centigrade.

Speaker 3:          00:13:43       So it's an environment that we don't really understand, but there has been models proposed by scientists on how life could actually exist in these lakes. It will be live and like anything we know of, obviously we can not even imagine the biochemistry of those forms of life. It wouldn't be water based, it could be carbon based, but it will be a chemistry completely different from what we're used to. So it's actually really hard to come up with ways of searching for evidence of life. Uh, on Dighton does, you don't really know where to begin. But there has been several missions proposed to go to titan within the next 15, 20 years. Um, and some of them are actually being considered as we speak, uh, by a review panel at Nasa, uh, for flight in the next, uh, in an, in an upcoming run missions. So data is very interesting, very alien.

Speaker 3:          00:14:29       But my favorite place, it's actually Enceladus and settle. This is a tiny moon. Maybe you know of it because it was in the news recently. It's been in the news for a while, but recently it made a big splash. I'll tell you in a second way then sell it as a tiny moon. It's about the diameter between here and La. It's not a big one. Um, but it's unique in the sense that he has this active gazers coming out of the surface. This is an actual picture of Enceladus they can buy the Cassini mission and in the South Pole of the moon you can see here that picture center at the South Pole. There is these features here, features on the surface. These are called Tiger stripes. These are cracks in the ice shelf, in the shell of the moon. And through this crux, there's stuff venting into space that was discovered by Cassini.

Speaker 3:          00:15:13       And arbitrary in the Saturn system that NASA and the European sent together in the 1923 2003, uh, took this has been investigating this month for the last then in 2015 years. Now the Cassini is just plunging into Saturn as we speak to the end of the mission. But through the lifetime of the mission, we've been able to, NASA has been able to fly that spacecraft through the plumes of Enceladus multiple times and study the chemistry of those plumes. It turns out that those blooms are made mostly of water. They contain CO2, methane, ammonia and hydrogen. This is great for microbes. These, this candy for some microbes is an energy source for micro organisms on earth. On top of that, we know that those gazers contains salts, sodium, just very similar to the salts that make up the ocean of the earth and they also can contain pain is silica grains a few nanometers.

Speaker 3:          00:16:06       Silica is the staff that is made in hydrothermal vents at the bottom of the ocean. And organics seems to be lots of organics, apt to, at least Cassini detected at two carbons six organics. Carbon six a is was the limit of detection of the instrument. They couldn't see things bigger than carbon six for a number of reasons. So the expectation is that there are probably more complex organics in the ocean and all those samples are coming into space for free. And so they're just waiting for us to send a spacecraft and continue looking at that chemistry for free. Maybe not for free, maybe your hand it hand and $50 billion, but once we get there, the samples are for free. So, um, recently, uh, uh, our team at Nasa Ames in collaboration with Goddard space flight center and the, uh, uh, APL laboratories at Johns Hopkins University, we will propose the mission to do precisely that, the return to end sellers and search for evidence of life in the applied materials coming out of the South Pole.

Speaker 3:          00:17:10       Now that mission gets selected by NASA, it's going to make it there somewhere sometime in the mid twenties, thirties. Um, I, I expect to be there. Weed smoking started running. So, um, uh, but it's one of those things that shows you how complicated technological it is. Missions can be because of the distance, because of the complexity of the science in all these type of things. But in the meantime, we have 25 years to figure things out. That's the good news. And so we keep studying the, uh, all the data that comes back from Cassini and that just wanted to share with you some letters, results of a conceptual model. We build very simple model, but they think it's very important based on Cassini data. So told you the Cassini detected hydrogen coming out of the, uh, of the plume and he also can a detected silica grains.

Speaker 3:          00:17:56       The Silica has already been linked to hydrothermal vents at the bottom of the end sellers ocean. So this would be a cross section of the moon with the ice shelf and the plums in the southern hemisphere. We know that there is an ocean based on the composition of the plumes. We know that there is hydrothermal activity at the ocean sediment interface based on the presence of those silicon nanoparticles. Um, now when we take the composition, that composition that comes out of Cassini and we put it in the ocean and we shake it and we run our geo chemical models, it turns out they're all that gas, hydrogen and methane there. It's been detected in the plume has to be forming here at the bottom of the ocean. And as quickly, as soon as it forms, it's actually starts bubbling because there is so much guys that it's actually above the hydrostatic pressure.

Speaker 3:          00:18:38       And then that guy's forms, bubbles and those bubbles with the bubbles. Do they rise? They like to go up and we've been running some models to estimate how big those bubbles would, how fast they would rise, how big they would be. Turns out it might be enough gas in there to mix the entire ocean, which is good for us, but most importantly, it's enough stuff to bring hydrothermal vent fluids. This is an example of a picture from the ocean on the earth where you can see the hydrothermal vents, uh, pumping fluids into the ocean. These fluids could go straight up into the plumes in about timescales of, uh, several months. Earth months just aided by these rapid raise of bubbles, which means that we're, we're sampling in the moon actually has a significant amount of hydrothermal material living in there. Why is that important? Because we know that there are microbes on the earth that's like to grow around these hydrothermal vents.

Speaker 3:          00:19:33       Also shrimp and other stuff we don't inspect shrimp on and some others, but, but the microbes, the microbes would be enough and they will be fine. If we have an ecosystem of microbes developing at the bottom of these hydrothermal vents using that hydrogen and methane and CO2 and nutrients to grow and reproduce some of those microbes, or at least their decay products, they could get and trained in these rising plume come back, uh, shooting through the, through the gazers, I mean through the plumes on the surface. Now our spacecraft could catch those microbes or the chemistry associated to them and maybe find evidence for life. So this is that these gets may five stars as the most interesting destination in the solar system. Uh, even vacation will be interesting there. So, uh, now the question that brings us at this point is there is obviously the search for life.

Speaker 3:          00:20:23       The search for a second, Janice, I hope that I convince you that it's timely. We now have plenty of destinations to go to. Um, and it's real. It's a, it's a reality. I'm not saying there is live there, I'm just saying that all the conditions we could hope for our med there. So there is no really a excuse now to continue investigating. Now the question, next question is how do we discover a second genesis of life? That's what's going take is mostly of the rest of this, of the talk. Now, up until recently, this pretty much what our understanding of a extra tray. So forms of life, uh, aliens are typically defined geographically. If something is not a part of the planet, it must be an alien. Must be a second genesis of life. But that really, that's not, that's nothing. That's not a statement.

Speaker 3:          00:21:10       They scientifically, uh, you, you can support it with scientific data just yet. Uh, there's been plenty of models tossed around about Panspermia probably you are familiar with the concept and Panspermia is the transfer offline between planetary bodies. There are actually different flavors of Panspermia. There has been a, the most unlikely type of Panspermia you can think of. It's interstellar panspermia the transfer of life between distance solar systems. Now these models, the only reason they're considered is, is the, uh, because the probabilities are so low. The only things that make, the only thing that makes these models palatable to a scientist is the enormous time at the university has been around. And so when you factor in time, then anything is possible. Uh, but we're not, uh, Panspermia fans are not really a cleansing their hubs on these interstellar Panspermia. There Mosley thinking on two different types of more local panspermia commentary.

Speaker 3:          00:22:05       Panspermia Planetary Uplink Twinsburg Mia. The first one commentary is the idea that, uh, our solar system didn't come out of nowhere. Uh, our son him from the um, um, accumulation of gas that resulted from the explosion of a previous sun as far as we know it now probably that sign also had planets based on what we know about sons in the universe. People have proposed that if life evolved on that previous solar system or any of the previous solar systems that existed before our own in the same spot in the universe, and those forms of life could have been a hanging around while the planets were forming and then come back to colonize the right planets back again. That's commentary Panspermia at some people have postulated that the universe is actually percolating with. It's very curated with uh, uh, materials that contain, contain forms of life preserved in them.

Speaker 3:          00:22:57       And that could be sitting the universe throughout. Now you can, the, the interesting thing about Panspermia is it might deliver or not. It doesn't matter. Believe he's not a scientific, a valid approach. There is nothing that that suggests that this theory is wrong. And that goes at the, that goes to the core of the problem of how we search for a second genesis of life and why we need to search for a second genesis of life. The last one is the one you know probably you're more familiar with its planetary Prince Permian is the concept that planets after they formed in the solar system, they've been literally exchanging spit a back and forth early on. They were younger, they were more uh, okay, I'm now going to go there. But there was a lot of exchange going on early on in the history of the solar system.

Speaker 3:          00:23:42       It's plenty of meteorites from Mars and earth. There is mere rides from Earth on Mars. People have actually estimated the probability given a number of factors of lives transferring between planets starting on Earth Ground Zero. Even that 13% chances than biological material could be actually successfully transferred to Venus. Not An small chance of lives transformed tomorrow's back and forth. Actually, if people have postulated an origin of level Mars and later transferred to Earth based on the number of Joe Chemical prisons, even places like Europe and then sell this, there is a, there is more but still, uh, existing probability that life could be transferred between them. So the bottom line of this is that you cannot assume that aliens can be geographically defined. Geographics then apply to aliens and Liz and less we know unless we find a second example of flavor can we can use to prove it.

Speaker 3:          00:24:33       So these, uh, review, this needs to revision. We need to update our concept, how we treat aliens in many different ways. Um, and so the question then comes, so how do we search for a second genesis? If we can just go find life somewhere else and claim second geneses then how do we search for it? And I'm going to go through as through a short thought process that I'm hopefully exemplifies the way we've been doing this. We've been going about this business for the NAM a number of decades now. Certain flight, but I'm gonna use a different example. So they, this picture of the universe and we know now that there are more planets than stars in the galaxy and there is plenty of galaxies out there. So there is a large number of planets out there. And now think for a second that earth is the only planet we know.

Speaker 3:          00:25:23       There's no other planet in the solar system. Earth is now a number one. Everything we know our planets is captured in the earth. And uh, we decided to search for other planets out there. Are there other planets other than the earth? We could devise an experiment where we take our planet, we look at the way it's made, the way it's built, the composition, the shape, the size and everything. And we can define a series of what we would call planet signatures. And then we could go, we could, we could build a telescope and started searching for planets out there based on the presence or absence of those planets signatures. We could try to search for direct imaging morphology. If we see something that moves, started the move, if something moves a wonder, there should be a planet we could, we could look for that. We could look for a motion, we could look for unique compositions.

Speaker 3:          00:26:11       We know that the atmosphere of the earth is very unique. It's very unlikely to exist somewhere else, uh, especially, uh, in places like stars or rock stars. And so if we see an anomaly of nitrogen and oxygen, for example, we could claim that there is a planet out there. Now you can guess this is not a very efficient way of looking at planets. And in fact, that's not how we look at planets. The way we look at planets around other stars is by a number of methods. But mostly they're focused on looking at a star and looking for anomalies in what we know about that star. In this case, the anomalies represented as a law, as a decree, as a decline in brightness. So here we have a spectrum of the brightness of the star. In this case is actually, I think this is Venus going around our own son.

Speaker 3:          00:26:58       The same applies to other planets. And we see how when the planet crosses in front of the star, the brains of the star of the quizzes in a predictable way. Now obviously this is not what we see when we look at exoplanets is what we see when we look at exoplanets, we actually see the planet. Bottom line is we don't need to look for planets in order to search for planets. We don't need to look for planets signatures. What we need to do is we need to focus on something that we understand very well, whose physical laws are very well understood and see if there is any, anything in those in the behavior of that object that doesn't come that cannot be explained by what we know about physics. There's in fact the way we search for planets, maybe not consciously, but it's a very robust way of looking for planets because you're not presupposing anything about those planets evolve.

Speaker 3:          00:27:43       Evolve. When Neil was that planets are made of oxygen, have an atmosphere of oxygen and nitrogen and that they are the size of the earth. They look blue and that's all we look for. We'd still be looking for planets today and we will put in there, found anyone, uh, we need to be able to search for planets with, are looking for planets. This covering planets without searching for planets. Now that's not how we've been searching for life despite we also start with the data number of one. What we do, people normally scientists do, they come up with biosignatures instead of planet signatures and then they start searching for those biosignatures in other planets. And that just makes the same sense. It's looking for planets, signatures, in my opinion, when your database, all your data is based on one, any see any signature you look for a is suspect of what we call confirmation bias. You're not searching for something, you're confirming that something is there. You assume there is something there that has these in these properties. You just want to confirm your assumptions. Now, this is not something we do on purpose, but it's something that it's underlying every, uh, every effort to search for life out there and that I think it's a big important problem.

Speaker 3:          00:28:53       So the question is, no, it's not. How do we discover a second genesis of life? The question is how the whiskey cover a second genesis of life without searching for life. And that's an interesting question. How do you go about this? Can we have, can we find a way to search for live the same way we search for exoplanets? And so to do that we actually have to go back and obviously look at what we know and what we know is live on earth. This is probably, you're familiar with it, that just a representation of the tree of life there is simplified. But this covers our family tree for the last 4 billion years. Uh, we are up here now at the tip of the Oak. Harriet's a team is not something [inaudible] in evolutionary biology. This could be a dead end for us. The fact that we are up in the branches doesn't mean that we're better or worse.

Speaker 3:          00:29:37       It just means that we're up in the brunches. Um, uh, would we know of based on these organization of the tree that there is a lot of interesting and useful information we can learn about life on earth and we can extract some that, some of that information, uh, in, uh, and apply it to strategy search for life somewhere else. So we know for example, and we'll talk about these in a second, that all the major groups of life on earth, the bacteria, the archaea and they will carry it. These two are small unicellular organisms, all of them, the precarious, we all come from the same last universal common ancestor called the looker down here. Last universal common ancestor. We all branched out of the same one, the same successful one, but this was not the origin of life. The origin of life on earth happened somewhere here with what we call the organism or the original organism.

Speaker 3:          00:30:25       Uh, that was our founding organism. Um, and there was a period we know, or there must have been a period we know of intense evolution between the origin of life and loca where there's was a lot of biochemistry going on, a lot of trial. And error. A lot of mutations, a lot of organisms trying to figure things out. Even there could have been things branching out. The disappeared eventually because they weren't successful enough or there were infinity enough and there is no record of those anymore. Uh, we'll go back to this issue of how far into these periods we can look at in a few seconds because that's important. But we can take this basic structure of life on earth and we could just do a quick thought, a thought exercise on what possibles, what possibilities are out there in terms of a second genesis, how would a second, Janice is related to these, obviously what we mean essentially by a second.

Speaker 3:          00:31:18       Genesis is a form of life that is not related to these guys. That's what we mean by a second. Genesis, no more, no less. Uh, we're not assigning locality to a second. Genesis. There could have been a second genesis on earth for as far as far as we know, when people have postulated, uh, uh, second geneses at a second biosphere on the earth lurking in the shadows that biochemical is independent from us now has never been found. But it did. Interesting idea. Uh, we're looking for a second genesis something and related to us or regionally. Uh, but we can constrain this space of what's possible we can possibly find out there just by making some basic assumptions. So essentially that's goes back to our original idea. There is a prebiotic world. There is no life. An origin of life event happens on our planet that led to interesting biochemistry, the RNA world and whatnot.

Speaker 3:          00:32:08       And eventually, uh, the mother and organisms branching out until today. Now, if we go to Mars and we find a form of life and we can do all the chemistry, we don't, we do two living organisms, uh, and it turns out that we can map these organisms back. That's what it's gonna look like. It's going to map somewhere in our tree of life. It's not going to be a second genesis. That's one possibility that life out there actually shares a common ancestry. We will be able, we might be able to look to, to uh, to establish that second possibilities. What I see I call a close second geneses. That would be an example of a form of life that is independent from us in origin but it came out of the same kind of soup organic soup and we'll talk about a in a few slides of what we mean by the same kind of soup or we could talk about a distance second genesis and there will be a form of life completely unrelated to us coming out of uh, coming out of a very different type of probiotic soup that we couldn't even begin to imagine.

Speaker 3:          00:33:05       Although actually you might think of a couple of split one plays in the solar system where that might happen. So here's what I propose as the solution to how to come out of this conundrum. How can we establish whether some plays in the solar system contains a common ancestor or a close second geneses or a distant second genesis. It goes back to something we are familiar with since the 1930s the theory of organic chemical evolution you may be familiar with with this theory of your read about the origin of life. That's the theory that debunks the idea that life is a spontaneous generation. It live instead propose that life is just another, it's a continuum in the process of organic chemical evolution in the universe. It's a very interesting theory. It's in fact the theory means that it's supported by a lot of evidence. It's right now is the most successful explanation of how chemistry happens in the universe, all the way to uh, thinking organisms.

Speaker 3:          00:34:02       Now, there are four tenants. The theory of organic chemical evolution. The first one is that there is chemistry going on in the universe with or without the presence of life that results in the synthesis of organic or small organic molecules like amino acids and nucleotides. These are molecules we're familiar with because those are parts of our, what? Biochemistry, but they're done. It's not live. It's not required for amino acids to exist. The second tenant is that they are a combination of these small molecules forms, larger molecules called polymers. And that can happen again with or without the presence of life. Now in the case of at least one planet in the universe, the combination of those polymers eventually resulted in small droplets, self organized droplets that we call protopia loans that will be the first organisms. And uh, fueled by the process of evolution by natural selection.

Speaker 3:          00:34:56       Darwin, those pro a pro by owns, uh, became more and more complex, eventually figured out how to transfer information between different organisms. And that just cascaded into a huge complexity. It's still chemical complexity. The bottom line of the fury of organic chemical addition is that these are steps that just [inaudible] off one from the other. We'd done, we'd done, we cannot separate them. We don't need to separate them. We can separate evolution by natural selection from the origin of life, from prebiotic evolution, from basic prebiotic chemistry. It's all part of the same continuum. And because it's part of the same continuum, this should be fairly frequent in the universe. It's, there's nothing here that it's earth lead it related at please not as far as we know, unique to the earth.

Speaker 3:          00:35:46       So here's a representation of the same idea in the case of the earth. So here you have the four stages in the, in their organic chemical evolution. We start with the NAB, with the Solar Nebula, the beginning of the uh, the better beginning of the solar system. We know that there were compounds, very basic molecules like water, uh, ammonia, methane, [inaudible]. That stuff is all over the universe. Uh, it was probably president, our Nebula when the planets, sorry, the form, you have room for more complex chemistry, uh, that uh, these molecules react and they generate other basic molecules like amino acids. Nucleotides were not. Eventually when the planet calls down, these things can grow into larger more complex molecules. Think of it as a process of crystallization. The same way as lava, a hot Floyd where everything is mixed and everything is, is chaotic. When it starts to call, call down, it starts to crystallize. And then you have big structures for me. Hub, you can think of this. Chemistry in a similar way eventually starts to crystallize into complex forms. Now there is a singular event, the origin of life on earth where these things moved from free, floating a complex molecules into something very complicated membranes, proteins, uh, genetic material that eventually evolved through the process of their reading and evolution into very complex organisms up until today. But it's all part of the same continuum of increasing complexity.

Speaker 3:          00:37:12       Now, why is that important? While there is plenty of evidence of that, uh, these are amino acids, sugars, lipids, and nuclear basis. These are the four basic ingredients of our biochemistry. Any biochemistry on earth is based on those four types of basic comp compounds. And this is examples of those compounds. We find a mirror rates, um, all four of them. This is the list of amino acids that have been identified in meteorites so far that and that they're known to be non-terrestrial. Uh, you can read all of them here, but about half of the immuno acids we used to from our proteins are in these table and they're not biogenic. The same with sugars. We tend to use this type of sugars here. There is plenty of sugars and mid rates. These are tiny cell like structures that are formed when you put some meter aids in water.

Speaker 3:          00:38:02       Those meteorites have molecules, lipid fat like molecules that when they put them in water and you dissolve the media raid, they actually form these satellite like structures which have some resemblances in many different ways to our own cells and these are the nucleobases that form our DNA and RNA or DNA and RNA are made a free basic molecules. One of them or the nuclear basis, and these are the clubs is find in meteorites. Now you can see it here. Limpets they're finding live. They're finding me rides. They useful for membranes, sugars. Again, they're life. They're finding me right, so you should useful for energy. When we don't see meteorites are polymers, large sugars. That's the stuff of life. We make large stuff. We make big stuff. A meter rides don't the same with amino acids. They're finding meteorites, but we don't have proteins or bay complex polymers of amino acids to rides. And the same with nuclear basis. You don't see it here because I'm a in front of it. But um, there are nucleobases as I just showed you in meteorites, but there are not big polymers of nucleobases. Oh, it's down there. There you go.

Speaker 4:          00:39:04       Yeah.

Speaker 3:          00:39:05       Now it's very important that that realization that our chemistry is just the basic evolution, all of organic chemistry in the Universal Chemistry. It's very important. I tried to summarize the importance of it in this diagram and I'll try to walk you through that. Um, we have, we know there is prebiotic chemistry. I just showed it to you with pictures, actual pictures from the early solar system that we had a spacecraft they can pictures down there and we know that there was a Nebula, they're full of chemicals. There was no spacecraft at the early solar system, this closure. But anyway, uh, we know that there was prebiotic chemistry from which live on earth originated at the origin of life. And evolved into complex multicell organisms based on the abundance of those same compounds in the solar, in solar system materials we could expect that live on Mars with probably originate from a similar soup of compounds and they're very similar conditions and by similar conditions I mean water chemistry under 10 temperature, Ph and solidity similar to any environment on the earth. And so I would call,

Speaker 4:          00:40:14       yeah,

Speaker 3:          00:40:14       live on Mars if he'd ever existed a close second geneses because it's probably evolving from the same kind of starting materials, not too far off to think that way. I would actually go as far as to say that live on your opine and sellers would probably also trays back if it turns out they exist and we started, we can study their biochemistry, we can also, we can probably trace back their biochemistry to these prebiotic soup, the same starting materials because the same basic ingredients were used to build those, those roles. Now there is room for transfer of flight between planets. I just told you about Panspermia so we can always have, we always have to leave these up, these possibility open, but any of those three planets is sufficiently similar to the earth that we could postulate the presence in them have a close second genesis of life. Um, whereas Dayton, you can think of Titan as it plays that if he has life, it should be a very different chemistry from us. It probably started with very similar materials, but they quickly enable any process of organic chemical evolution in very quickly probably led to something very different from what we know and if it was life, which tends to speed up this process of complexity, then whatever we have there, it's something that we can not really comprehend it until we see it. So I called that as a list and second genesis of life.

Speaker 4:          00:41:30       Okay,

Speaker 3:          00:41:32       now that, why that, why is that important? Because that's chemistry we can play with. If you tell me that live on Mars, probably it was a close second geneses and he makes sense to think that way. I know how to distinguish. I know how to tell whether there was life there at some point or not. I'll try to convince you of that in a second. I think we're running out of time, right? Um, what I say is that because we really tend to be scientist, guess what, we tend to be over optimistic. We always tend to assume that there was life on Mars. And so again, we go back to the confirmation bias. All we would have to do is to confirm it. That's why we think about searching for cells or movement or a crawling. Reptiles are growing plants or things like this. Our signatures.

Speaker 3:          00:42:11       In fact, what we should do is what I propose these two fold I policies, uh, that puts yourself in the worst case scenario to address this fundamental question. The question is not whether there is life on Mars and syllabus or Europa. The question is how far the organic chemical evolution go in those planets? How far there you go. They go as far as the earth, probably not. Otherwise. There will be somebody giving a talk about this or Mars looking back at the earth. Uh, but you don't know in the spectrum of organic chemical evolution how far it could have gone. Maybe it stopped at the prebiotic chemistry and that's all we see, but in any case, that's the question we need to ask and these are the two hypotheses we need to falsify. Falsifying is a very important thing in science. We need to prove these two things to be wrong.

Speaker 3:          00:42:53       The first one is that is the a [inaudible] signal hypothesis and that means that organic chemical evolution on Mars, Europa or Enceladus never went beyond the prebiotic chemistry and all the chemistry we will see there is consistent with robotic sources. The second one, if we can falsify that one, if we can go to any of these places, run our organic chemistry kits and we figured out that we cannot explain that chemistry based on everything we know about a body chemistry than something else must explain it. That's something else I propose these earth life, it's either because of the process of Panspermia or because of contamination, planetary protection, the stuff we brought with us there. If we can prove this wrong, then we have a good case for a second genesis of life. But not until we have proved these two hypotheses wrong. Now the first one I had thought that the second one would be the easy one.

Speaker 3:          00:43:43       It turns out that, uh, I'm, I'm still, as I keep thinking through this logic, it turns out the dye might not be the case. I'll tell you why in a second. The first one that's in the Abe articulate bothers. It turns out that it's not that hard to do if you think about it. Cause if you keep thinking on this framework, organic chemical evolution, the universe, it's very lazy at making stuff. It doesn't really like to make big, complicated stuff. Likes to make a lot of simple stuff. That's why water, carbon nitrogen, that's mostly the composition of the universe. And in terms of organics, amino acids, a few sugars, some nuclear basis and a lot of graphite there is really, it's like, okay, that's it. That's as far as I'm going to go. And there is a predictable actually pattern in the comp in the complexity of organic chemistry that you can expect in the absence of life.

Speaker 3:          00:44:29       That's what you see here exemplified in the case off. I think these are amino acids. These are plots of showing carbon number and I mean a lot to these hydrocarbons. This is carbon number. So the more carbons or molecule has the more complex it is, the harder it is to build. And this is what you see in terms of carbon number distributions or abundances in hydrocarbons, molecules made of cartilage, carbon and hydrogen in in a biotic systems here is in hydrothermal vents, a directly sampled in the ocean and also in hydrothermal simulations in the lab. There's a lot of methane with one carbon and there is a tiny bit of ethane and propane and there is almost nothing of anything bigger than carbon six. And you can see the same distribution in meteorites. You can see the same, the situation in a organic chemistry, uh, uh, experiments in the laboratory.

Speaker 3:          00:45:24       We always end up with these ex exponential decay in abundance as a function of carbon numbers. A here is what I would think to do if I was going to go to Enceladus. Actually Cassini has already done some of the groundwork because CD has an ally's hydrocarbons coming out of the plume of Enceladus. These are the distribution of these thoughts there. They fall down the exponential decay line. Now unfortunately Cassini could see on the app the carbon six or so. I told you that in the beginning so we don't really know what's going on in the plume up there. If there was no life, the prediction would be that the abundance of hydrocarbons larger than six or seven carbons would be like this one. There will be nothing there. But if we go there and we sampled the plume and we started to see weird stuff, that's not something we can explain based on their battery chemistry.

Speaker 3:          00:46:10       Now, I haven't made it any position or any assumption on the biochemistry of forms of life on Enceladus. I'm just saying that I cannot explain that a biologically. And so something else must be explained that and that just for the case of hydrocarbons, if we look at amino acids, is a very similar story because the universe always works in mysterious ways. Uh, it likes to make a particularly small amino acid, two carbons, three carbons. That's mostly the staff you'll find in meteorites and stuff. Uh, and then very few of the very large carbon amino acids, except when you look at life, and these are the red dots here. These are all our amino acids. The relative abundance of immuno acid in ourselves, a nine of them is higher than 10%. We don't care how many carbons the immuno acid has. We care about what that amino acid glass for us.

Speaker 3:          00:46:57       And so if it, if we need a 10 carbon immuno acid, we'll invest the energy to build those 10 carbon immuno acids. And so what we'll end up with is and a biotech distribution that's predictable and he did an exponential decay on with carbon number and any other non, uh, exponential distribution is not something that we can explain a biologically, not saying it, it's not a biotic, but until we find a neighbor Arctic explanation, uh, the best alternative is a form of life. Now this is an example of that same principle. This is the amino acid. These are six, five, seven amino acids that are commonly found in meteorites and in organisms on earth. This is the abundance that we see for those immuno acids in carpet with carbon number. That's two carbon numbers. These are I think five carbon numbers in meteorites. You see the exponential decay in life, you see a very different pattern.

Speaker 3:          00:47:51       So that's the stuff we need to look for. Now the second I bought disease, if we go to sellers and we have these distributions that we cannot explain it [inaudible] then we need to show that it's not stuff that we brought with us or it's tough that was transferred between planets. That's what we call the terrestrial null hypothesis. And I have thought that that would be the easy one because we do that all the time, all the time on the earth. We study ancestry. That's what we do when we look at DNA and proteins. We tried to establish and gestural relations between organisms. So if we go to Enceladus, uh, it should be fairly easy to establish ancestral relations and and terming whether they came out of our three or they came from a different tree. Now the problem with that is, and that's where I'm going to stop.

Speaker 3:          00:48:33       So we could look at all these molecules, DNA on earth, non DNA, a second, genesis, three letter, genetic code, Different Code. Uh, we look for different types of proteins or different sales structures and all that good stuff. Now here's the problem though. That's where I'm stopping. We go back to our famous tree of life. It turns out that everything we know about biochemistry, because of the virtue of how life on earth has evolved, can only be really trace back to Luca, the last universal common ancestor. You can think of that, or at least I think of that as a biochemical horizon. We cannot see beyond that biochemical horizon because we've lost all that information. No photo albums off of our family before look at, there is no nothing preserved in the rocks other than shapes. There's no chemistry projecting the rugs. It was too, too long ago.

Speaker 3:          00:49:21       So we, we can't really tell what biochemistry was back then. All we know about biochemistry stops and starts with Luca. And so any biochemical difference becomes between live on earth or another planet. It becomes questionable whether it implies a second genesis or implies a common ancestor. And that's even more so when we start looking for a close second genesis that we all came up or the of the same soup because we never know. We will never know the exact composition of the first organism. It's, it, it might be impossible to actually tell a close second genesis from a common ancestor. That's what my thinking was as off 10:00 AM this morning. And so, uh, maybe I come up with a better idea later today, but, uh, that's, I think it's a very interesting question to think about. Uh, it might be an actual limitation in our understanding of cert on how we search for life in the universe. And so just to leave some time for questions, I'll leave you with the conclusions. They just summarize what I just said. We can read them as we are. If you have questions, I'll be happy to answer them. So thank you very much.

Speaker 2:          00:50:25       [inaudible].

Speaker 1:          00:50:32       So my question is, as far as we know, it's apostle tuff life does not, not based on it

Speaker 3:          00:50:38       biochemistry. Well we will call it bio chemistry. It might be a different, very different types of biochemistry. The moment you talked about life live by chemistry, there's no names. It's anonymous kind of thing. It might be not carbon based. That's probably what you're more thinking about it.

Speaker 1:          00:50:52       Oh yeah. Or even similar to AI.

Speaker 3:          00:50:56       All different dimensions you can, if you can have AI evolving from nothing. Like it varies. If you can come up with a theory of silicon organic or evolution or silica evolution, uh, then yes. A base that our assumption is that any AI was, uh, comes not from spontaneous or a spontaneous chemistry, but from biochemistry, you need biochemistry for ar to exist. That's an interesting question. Uh, if we, if we want to go into the concept of artificial, that's, oof, we can have another talk about that artificial, but something similar to the composition of Ai, like in that it's very ritual that people have proposed silicon based life, but they weren't thinking of microchips. They were thinking of the actual element and how it could sustain about chemistry analogous the carbon. But silicon based life has very different properties. It's very constrained. And in reality, I mean obviously you can never reject the idea of silicon based life again, but the element, not the microchip, uh, but it's not an accident that we're made of.

Speaker 3:          00:52:08       Carbon. Carbon is the third most abundant element or fourth more abundant element in the universe. And the other one is oxygen, nitrogen, hydrogen and helium. So other than the helium, we're pretty much covered the entire wheel state of the university in terms of elemental composition. There is no accident that we're made of that stuff. Um, there might be weird things out there, but for those weird things to exist, they will, they would have to be a process of chemical destination where carbon is removed from the equation and therefore allows weird silicon stuff to evolve. Uh, when it comes to AI, I think for, uh, behind every intelligent being there is a bacteria at least evolutionary, evolutionarily speaking. So he has to come from organic chemistry at some point.

Speaker 1:          00:52:55       Getting back to the previous slide, I don't, I don't really understand your thought process about why we have their pow pow, uh, chemical, you know, horizon is that because we assume, uh, all the, uh, you call it, Uhm, uh, organism under the low carb. You see, we see new chase between the, you know, chemical compilation, any proof

Speaker 3:          00:53:26       or evidence around there. So, so I don't follow that. I, yeah, I I I right with that because I was a thought I was running out of time, but uh, everything, so obviously we are here. You can think of that as a spacetime diagrams so to speak. We are here now at the tape of the o carriers and we have our technology to investigate biochemistry so we can go about studying biochemistry many different ways. We can go and dissect an elephant and understand the chemistry of the elephant, or we can go through the fossil record and look for fossilized organisms and we investigated their biochemistry so we can be looking for this. We can look for deep, deeply branching modern organisms that we know existed a long time ago and we can look at their biochemistry. We can even look at our own biochemistry, our own DNA, and look for what we call molecular fossils staff.

Speaker 3:          00:54:19       There is in our DNA, don't think of it, it's not trashed DNA, but think of it as stuff that at some point was useful. It's not useful anymore type of thing. Now really all that biochemistry, whether it's modern fossil or ancient, it goes back to looker. Really. You can also only trades back that to this last universal common ancestor. You can really not make any substantial inference based on these biochemistry about these biochemistry because all of these records is known. Obviously these biochemistry evolved from this. Uh, but the notion that all organisms have DNA and RNA and their composition, 20 amino acids in their proteins, the genetic code as we understand it all that is because it comes from looker. There could have been branches coming out that had a different biochemistry or we'll never know if they exist or not cause they would have been lost.

Speaker 3:          00:55:11       We don't know if these organisms had 20 amino acids or a 10 amino acids. Uh, we don't know. We actually know that at some point there were in DNA based people have postulated the RNA world. There was a wall, there was a period of time where there was no DNA biochemistry on earth. It was RNA based. They will have postulated that RNA probably was not the first generic molecule. There was another different type of molecule and people have even postulated a metal enzymes, enzymes based on magnesium and zinc and other metal compounds that were the first catalyzing compounds. So the more you go back in time, the more you realize that our biochemistry is not representative really of these biochemistry. It can only be trace back to Luca. Uh, and so that really means that if you go to, I'll, I'll give you the basic example.

Speaker 3:          00:55:59       If I go to Mars and I find a microbe that does, Dan doesn't have DNA, all I can tell you right now is that this didn't come out of looker. I see. I don't know if it came out of these branch that was not DNA base and I don't know because they could have been transferred or transfer of live on Mars very early on where there was live on the earth, very likely not DNA or RNA based. It would look like are different from us because the moment it gets transferred, these evolutionary land gets broken, then they're having time.

Speaker 1:          00:56:31       I see. So, so, so, so I see that the purpose of the research is trying to prove the second, the form of a [inaudible] space. The life you started, you started of simply prove their life. I break this,

Speaker 3:          00:56:45       I, I'd been advocating for that from a science point of view and I didn't really emphasize that. But from a science point of view, if you think a scientist is mung soft knowledge, people who are very obsessed with knowledge base discovering live is not really the angle that's stuff for you know, for explorers. I didn't know at somebody put it. Um, if you discover life on another planet, I mean the bottom line is that as a scientist we shouldn't think about the uh, the Scott finding life as the angle. That's when things begin. The reason and I end it goes back to my original argument about why we searching for life. Why are we searching for a second genesis of life? One of the reasons because we will never understand the origin of life on earth unless we find a second genesis plain and simple. Second one is because we may never understand all these process. Third example is because we buy a neighbor, I understand the range of biochemical possibilities out there and so finding live is just what needs to happen for us to start addressing those questions. Yeah. Thank you very much. Thank you all. It shouldn't be just about searching or finding. It should be about finding a second. Genesis.

Speaker 1:          00:57:55       Um, I do have a quick question from someone on the live stream. So this is from Tyler. He says a does hydrothermal vents on the moon mean that it has a molten core?

Speaker 3:          00:58:05       Yes, I got that Tyler. So, uh, obviously based on [inaudible] bed, uh, the observation, I guess I'll try, I'll trace it back. So, uh, as we travel back in time, um, the uh, observation that we can, uh, be sure about, he's this silicon nano grains in the plume of Enceladus. Now, uh, the best, the most likely explanation for that. So those Silicon Alley Grains are hydrothermal vents at the bottom of the ocean. We haven't seen the events. It's true everything we know about the moon though. So Jazz, the Dera hydrothermal vents there, what that implies is that there is a source of heat underneath the vents then was likely source of heat is some kind of molten core, uh, due to the gravity pressures due to the Saturn orbit. That just creates an off, uh, gravitational stress on the moon, that it actually keeps the whole core molten, just like the core of the earth.

Speaker 3:          00:59:08       Now, there could be additional sources of heat, like radioactive decay, a generates heat. Uh, but the fact that we see evidence of hydrothermal activity, it's a strong suggestion that the core of the moon is in fact at least partially molten and exactly as a source of energy, which is something that has been interesting as well because that implies that uh, probably Europa is the same scenario. You're all busy going bigger, but he has the same kind of a giant planet and around causing gravity pools. And so your boot x, you should, uh, we should expect hydrothermal vents at the bottom of Europe as well, molten rock. So a, the composition of those months, obviously it's not known because we haven't analyzed them, but based on everything we know, again, that most likely starting materials, we're not probably not different from the starting materials of the earth.

Speaker 3:          00:59:58       Con, dried meteorites made rides of asteroids, comets, lots of IC stuff because they were far away in the outskirts of the solar system. So what's cold, but it was probably stuff similar to what generated the earth now on earth because it's a big planet. There are always plenty of room for, and obviously we all started the same way as a big molten ball of lava. It's then was started that way. Europa, the earth, the earth was large enough that when he called down, there was plenty of room for heavy stuff to fall off, uh, because the cooling process was probably slow. And so when you call it slow, it's like when you cook it slow, things get better separated and stuff like this. Uh, so, uh, that's what happened on the earth. The planet was big enough, the cooling was low, so heavy stuff like Aaron and heavy metals drop to the, to the core and formed our core and sell it as is very small.

Speaker 3:          01:00:54       So it probably called very fast without a chance for things to differentiate. So what you have there in the core, it's probably still very representative of the original materials and the other, the only staff that was, uh, kicked out in the cooling process was probably stop there is volatile like water and that's why you have an ocean of liquid water on the surface and a lot of methane and stuff, which are all that stuff. It doesn't take high temperatures for that stuff to come out of the rock. Uh, but the silica, the minerals, things like these that formed these meteorites, it's probably still more than, they're not changing much. I don't know why I stopped in this.

Speaker 3:          01:01:34       So not being very familiar with the, this common ancestor of all life on earth. Is that Luca meant to be like one cell once back in time or just the origin? Yeah, them question right. Uh, we are now anything we can, the only thing we can say for sure about the origin of life on earth is that we don't know, uh, it must have happened, that's for sure. And Lez well, there is the, you know, the holographic Unilever's and matrix. But, uh, let's assume that it happened. Um, um, there are theories on how you could possibly envision it happening gradually. Obviously it wasn't just like that. Probably there was a combination of a molecular complexity happening. Eventually you need to self enclose something so there is detached from the environment and at some point that self enclosed thing that you can probably not still called live yet.

Speaker 3:          01:02:27       It has to have the ability of replicating or passing on information, which is really what defines life. So at that point that's when you talk about life. But that transition was probably a part of the ongoing process of evolution, of chemical evolution, how it happened. We don't know if it was one cell or if it was a protoplasm of goo covered with stuff that we don't know. It was probably not anything like what we think today. Uh, Tau rose who was one of the, uh, instigators of our modern understanding of biochemistry at this grabs is in a way that way. I did, I described it earlier in the process of crystallization of lava crystallizing. So it starts randomly and chaotically and slowly as it cools down, it becomes something more organized, complex. And eventually you end up with a self replicating entity, call it a cell or a guru.

Speaker 3:          01:03:25       And then that's when the process of Darwinian evolution kicks and then complexity, it just goes off the roof. Um, but it's all part of the same. And so it's really hard to tell how it started, how it, if we were to travel back to four and a half billion years ago, 4.2 billion years ago, uh, it probably be be hard pressed to tell whether it's life that we see there versus very complex prebiotic chemistry versus something entirely different. Yeah. But we don't know. We need more data points to really know that. And, and that, I think that's a very important point to keep in mind. Why is important search for life out there? Because we will never know unless we find a new genesis. We can cook as many things, but if we want in the lab, it's very unlikely we'll generate life in the lab, uh, from zero, from scratch. And so, uh, hopefully, hopefully happens. But, uh, but my guess is that not until we find a second genesis, we can really understand the way life on earth originated. Cool. And what's Luca stand for and what, what does it need, Luca, what does it stand for? Look at last universal common ancestor.

Speaker 5:          01:04:35       So my question is what are the options for detecting

Speaker 3:          01:04:40       biotic organic evolution and exoplanets? Right now it's an, it's very unlikely we, we can do it. Uh, but I assuming unlimited funds and technology that doesn't exist, you could think of, you could search for, um, chemical. Does that clear? We an atmosphere in the atmosphere of exoplanets. So obviously the first thing you would do it would be because there is so many of them, you would shorten the list and you would focus on the ones that are close, right distance from the sun, the rice, the right distance, define as the distance that allows liquid water to be stable on the surface. So you focus on those. And then in those you could search for, I mean, the atmosphere, so coexist enough gases, they shouldn't coexist unless something is pumping them in the atmosphere and the earth. You have the example of oxygen, there is high abundance. There is no a biotic way of making that much oxygen in, you know, on a planet. Uh, although people have come up with clever ways of doing it. Uh, but the fact that you have oxygen and methane coexisting all the time means that both are being produced because otherwise they would emulate each other. They would cancel the other.

Speaker 5:          01:05:53       I meant more. Is it possible to detect this, um, these weird distributions of carbon chains? Not that

Speaker 3:          01:06:01       we need samples for that. We need, we need stuff. We need to be able to inject something in an instrument to do these types of detectors. We can, we can certainly take carbon hydrogen so we can detect like we've done in, uh, uh, interstellar space. You can detect certain compounds. Um, but mostly you detect these seal to methane and all that stuff. Uh, the abundance of this. So I guess I'll give you another example. We've, we've done, we've gone for the thought exercise of we wanted to detect those molecules on Enceladus coming out of the plume. What should be our limit of detection so that if we don't find anything we can create a confident that there is nothing in there. And I think our leaders estimate was we should be, our instrument should be able to detect femto molar abundance. That's 10 to the minus 15, uh, concentrations.

Speaker 3:          01:06:55       Um, in order to be able to tell, well, you know what, there is nothing there. Uh, and to do that we need the best instruments on earth and we need a very complicated way of collecting enough material from the ocean that we can actually inject into the instruments doing that remotely with telescopes. It's a, it's a show stopper and the Bra. And so, uh, the, the, the fact that you don't see them wouldn't mean that they're not there because your limit of detection would be so inaccurate. You can only say that based on your limit of detection, you can see trees on whatever planet you have out there. Not even, I mean, other people have proposed to look at the surveys and, uh, like if you look at the surface of the earth, you could detect chlorophyll for example, but you need a planet like the earth and you need a satellite orbiting the earth, the planet. You can do that from our Alpha Centauri.

Speaker 5:          01:07:50       Um, if I may another question. So you mentioned that, um, it's the stuff in our solar system was made from a previous star. I wonder what the chances are of life, um, becoming recycled through that process.

Speaker 3:          01:08:02       Yeah. Uh, people have looked into that both in terms of the, the problem of transfer of light between planets or live surviving. And again, it's, um, uh, you can always fit a model to anything you want. Uh, but life is very resilient and surviving in dormant state that we know. Uh, and there are scenarios when you think about the transfer of planet of life between Earth and Mars, there are plausible scenarios of rocks moving from one plan to the next in time scales that are shorter than what we know. Microbes can survive doormen that much we can say. Uh, and when he comes to commentary Panspermia so life come originating in the end, it really comes back to, it comes down to how big a chunk of material you have floating around. Uh, because really what kills out there is not the cold is the radiation.

Speaker 3:          01:09:01       Uh, time kills eventually, but it takes a long time for time to kill and nothing else. Uh, radiation is what really kills you quickly are there. So if you're a microbe sitting in the, in the nucleus of a big asteroid and we talk in a few kilometers in size, you'll probably will never see an obligation to kill you over hundreds of millions of years. Uh, and so, uh, it's, I'm oversimplifying a bit, but um, you can always find a plausible scenario where a microbe could survive. Bottom line, I don't think we should expect that to be the first explanation. But the problem is that you can rule it out. There's no amount of hand waving you can do to rule that possibility out until you go and you find a second genesis of life on Mars truly. And then you can confidently say that life on earth didn't originate out of that comment or that commentary or that he wasn't transfer.

Speaker 3:          01:09:58       Uh, as long as you don't find a second geneses that quest, that possibility is always going to be open, which is a very important thing. I don't want to keep you, but it's a very, I didn't mention that, but it's a, it really speaks to how we search for live as well. Because when you think about a second genesis and how, and to distinguish between the second genesis and a possible common origin, not every bio signature is equal. If you find, if you go to Mars, I don't know if you guys know about stromatolites, uh, there, these are microbial. There are rugs there are made or by microbial activity and their fossilized. And we say, I mean the fossil record, uh, and would you see in the fossil record is just the shape of the rock. That looks weird, but it is nothing in that world that speaks of life other than the shape.

Speaker 3:          01:10:44       Now, if we go to Mars, actually I'm too far away. If we go to Mars and we find a stromatolite these weird shape, maybe you can tell there was life on Mars at some point, but you can't tell how we originated. You will never tell based on the shape of stromatolites, whether it's a common origin or a second genesis. And so, uh, that might be one of those things that happen 20 years from now when we find it. And then we get all excited and we published our paper in nature, and the next day is like, wait a second, what did this guy come from? And then we have to send another mission to search for biochemistry. And so I'd really matters how we think about the search for life before we start searching for it. Because you can end up with many years of time and money not spent the right way. I'll still be happy if we find a store model. Omar's, but yeah. Thank you.
