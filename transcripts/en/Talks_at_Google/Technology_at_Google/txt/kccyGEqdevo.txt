Speaker 1:          00:08          Well, it is great to be here and excited to do this and thank you Armand for, for putting that talk together. Um, I think we're going to have fun together for the next hour. That's, that's the goal is to learn, but also to sort of have some fun together. So, um, over the course of the today's our conversation, we'll attend to do this. We'll try to define urban technology, explain really what we can achieve from it and the really sort through some of the challenges. So in my mind, I think we're thinking about this question of how will it influence quality of life? Why do we care, how do we measure success and then how do we implement it? Um, so most importantly, our esteemed panelists, uh, which we'll introduce here in a second. We'll introduce how technology is really sort of shaping their fields. I think we've got an interesting group of panelists, uh, both representing sort of community and development and arts, a real estate development and obviously technologist. So let me do this. Let's introduce and welcome our panelists. Um, you have Google's very own Greg Neville manning. Welcome. Uh,

Speaker 2:          01:06          Greg

Speaker 1:          01:07          is the CTO of sidewalk labs. As you, many of you probably know sidewalk labs is an alphabet, so bitaray applies people centric to urban design. Um, and really frankly is one of the, the talks of the, a really sort of one of those things that people like myself, urban, urban real estate developers and urbanists or really sort of thinking about, um, in terms of, in terms of technology and how it will have an impact really on our field and what that means for us going forward. Yeah, I would jump in for those of you who are fairly new, if you don't know, Craig actually started the Google New York City campus. Ooh, that's why you're all here.

Speaker 1:          01:44          We also have Jonathan Rose. Jonathan is the CEO of the rose companies. Um, which is a development company which finds new ways to improve communities. You know, both environmentally, socially and economically. Um, rose companies have, has developed a more than a hundred projects, um, across the United States. It is the 10th larger owner of affordable housing across the country. Um, in addition, Jonathan, um, is a, is a recent author wrote a really terrific book, which I would recommend for all of you to take a look at. It's called the well tempered city. It's a, it's a wonderful, wonderful book. Um, so please take a look. So join me in welcoming Jonathan as well.

Speaker 1:          02:24          We also have Elizabeth Goldstein, who's the president of the municipal art society, uh, here in New York. Uh, the arts society has helped New York advocate for thoughtful and inclusive urban design, uh, for almost 125 years or over 125 years. And I will tell you that as we talk about the ideas of displacement and gentrification, a lot of the challenges that cities like New York is facing, the role of your team, your organization, and what, uh, the municipal arts society does is critically important. On prior to becoming the president of that organization, she was also the president of the California State Parks Foundation and most importantly has worked inside government for really long time. So as we talk about this idea of implementing technology into government and getting government to sort of adopt this, you'll have some great insights for us as well. So please join me in and also welcoming Elizabeth to the conversation.

Speaker 2:          03:18          Yeah.

Speaker 3:          03:19          So you heard everything Steve's Steven said and he's going to run the show. But so many of you reached out saying, you want to ask Craig and everybody questions. I will have a dory going. If you've got to go ask the panel, I'll try to squeeze in a couple, no promises, but uh, that, that's what I'll be doing over here. So if you want to take it.

Speaker 1:          03:36          Sure. So I think what's it start with an opening panel cup question for all of the panelists. And that is this, as we think about urban technology, how are you seeing technology factor in to the longterm sort of vision and work of your organizations? And maybe just provide a really specific example for us. Elizabeth, we'll start with you.

Speaker 4:          03:55          Sure. I'd be delighted to do that. I mean, I think, uh, technology both has an extraordinary ability to change and make our lives in cities much better. But it also poses some very significant public policy challenges. Um, if you just think about the sharing technology and the controversy that's existed around Airbnb, for instance. Um, and even some of the carshare programs, to what extent the city should yield a spaces that normal people park in two shared car services, for instance, is a question that wouldn't have been posed a number of decades ago. It just would never have come up right? Cause the technology drove the ability, forgive the pun, drove the ability to, to um, engage in that way. Uh, and the sharing economy, um, is obviously posting lots of challenges from a public policy perspective, both in a really strong and positive way, but also in some ways that are really challenging.

Speaker 1:          04:54          So, Jonathan, what about the work that you do with your company? How is technology impacting what you all are doing out the communities across the u s got it. Okay.

Speaker 5:          05:01          So, first of all, we're, we have a vast technological rethink project going on now where we're committed years and millions of dollars to thinking about how we upgrade our systems and data. And so I want to start with an analogy and then I'll talk about how we're applying. Okay. So the amazing, to me, the model for everything is nature and nature is, has a, uh, you know, uses DNA is this basic data system. But with the, with nature actually does, has an incredible ability to heal. So imagine if there was a forest fire, um, nature knows exactly the small plans to the medium sized planets and the big plants in it. It knows how to grow back a whole ecosystem. And what's phases to do that and the way we build cities, we don't know how to heal. So the question is, um, and since we're tiered primarily working in low income parts of cities and with low income residents, our question is how can we use data to turn our static dumb ways that we run cities and buildings and people and

Speaker 6:          05:58          systems now to make them dynamic and responsive and reactive. And ultimately co-evolving. Great. What about you Craig? The work that you all are doing with sidewalks? A lot. So there's a tiny bit of background, sidewalk labs, a form with express idea of taking advantage of, of technology in the cities and, and figuring out how we might take a big leap in terms of technology that cities aren't maybe taking it completed on a job. So one example of a technology that we think this is slightly future looking, we'll have a big impact and will come as no surprise to you as his self driving vehicles. Um, not just from the way they will help people get around, but actually even more so as their impact on how urban planning gets done. So just if you think about self driving cars reducing or probably eliminating the need for parking, right?

Speaker 6:          06:43          Cause they'll drop people off and pick them up and if they need to recharge, they can go up to somewhere where the people aren't. Um, what do we do with that space? Either an existing cities that's now kind of along the sides of all our streets and in our parking lots. Uh, how can we use that space better for people? Um, and if we're designing a place from scratch, how wide should the streets be? Um, how should the space be allocated that might've previously been diverted to vehicles. Um, and so I think that has a number of really far reaching consequences beyond just my ability. It's, is this whole idea of being able to reclaim, I've been in the public space, right. I mean, that in my mind is one of the exciting things about, a little bit about exciting things about autonomous vehicles is that for for such a long time we've lost a big piece of the public realm and we're going to essentially be able to hopefully claim some of that space back.

Speaker 6:          07:29          Right. So as we think about what you guys are doing in Toronto, um, particularly, maybe talk a little bit maybe about, um, as you think about the design of the space in Toronto in a, of the, of the project in Toronto, what, what sort of other, beyond autonomous vehicles do you see technology playing a role to improve living standards? Maybe you know, from an environmental standpoint, from even from just a traditional quality of place standpoint. Absolutely. Yeah. So, so this is a tiny bit of background and sidewalk labs is really focused on building a place, a brand new place from scratch and Toronto, right on the waterfront. It used to be deport area of, of uh, Toronto, um, over some amount of time and we're still in the planning process and the, and going through getting permission from the city and the province of Ontario and the, and the federal government of Canada to go ahead and do that.

Speaker 6:          08:15          Um, but I hope for that area, which has really undeveloped right now. So it's almost Tabula Rasa is to think about, as you mentioned, sustainability sort of environmental things. How can we make this place kind of positive, so not just reduce the use of carbon but reduce it to below zero, um, through, um, clever applications of technology to make heating and cooling more efficient to non digital technologies like heating dis, district heating and cooling, which is often used on some campuses, but expand that to a whole neighborhood. Um, we think about mobility, which I already mentioned. There's a whole bunch of really interesting things even beyond self driving vehicles there. Um, when we think about buildings themselves, um, you know, there are lots of technologies that will enable and some already exist in some form as to make buildings much more flexible, so able to adapt to different users over time, but also cheaper to build at the same or high quality than we have existing buildings.

Speaker 6:          09:11          So the buildings themselves and as you referenced, the quality of the public realm, uh, each of these things contributes to quality of life in the city. And those are our goals. Um, but in particular in the public realm, if you think about it, not just as parks, um, but once you think about sidewalks and streets and maybe start erasing the boundaries between sidewalks and streets and say these places are for people, um, how do we make them much more usable for a whole bunch of different activities beyond what people use in for now? Uh, and really almost create a public realm that's an extension of your living room to make the whole place much more livable. We think about also ways of supporting more community and health and human services. Um, and then sort of underlying all of that, how do we actually build the digital technology that, that ties us all together.

Speaker 6:          09:57          And there are opportunities there to, to create less siloed systems than currently exist within cities. So what I'm hearing is this idea about how we use technology really to really push the envelope on sort of people centric design, right? Designers and urban developers and people and mice are space. I've been thinking about this a long time but had been constrained by this. But one of the things with, with technology pushing the boundaries a little bit, we're maybe able to push the envelope so to speak on this a little bit more perhaps. Yeah, absolutely. And you know, there are many things that, um, that, that the main, the cities move more slowly than technology does. Um, one of those, for example, cities have the responsibility to take out the trash, you know, on a regular basis. And if that's, um, that's a, that's a significant problem.

Speaker 6:          10:37          Uh, and so cities are unwilling to take big risks and technologies, you know, at, at Google and elsewhere. We build little prototypes, we throw them out there, we say, this is in Beta. If it works, great, we will do more of it. If it doesn't work, we'll shut it down. Cities don't have that luxury. Um, and so we hope that by creating a place where we can actually experiment with some of these technologies, um, and prove that some of them do work, um, then other cities, it turns out that once CDC and other city doing something successfully, they're much more likely to follow along. There might be some sort of leading cities that we'll try it initially and once there were a few than than, than the way it happens. And so our hope is to kind of bootstrap that. I love that idea of replication, right?

Speaker 6:          11:18          This idea that you can take ideas and sort of take it and put it in other cities. And that's why the project, what you all are doing in Toronto I think is really important. So Jonathan, I want to go back to what you originally said about this idea of thinking about cities as organisms and particularly why data is so important to us. So tell us a little bit more about how you sort of see data and syncing syncing and scenario planning playing a role to make us a much more dynamic planning system, maybe to make things more efficient.

Speaker 5:          11:45          So we plan in a 19th century way, essentially maybe early 20th century and then kind of, I feel, um, distorted by in 1970 we passed something called Neba and we have an environmental impact statement process, which just screws everything up as far as far as I'm going and I'm going to deepen environmentalist. So, uh, and the reason is we can't dynamically respond to anything. So here's what I recommend is that number one, cities set visions and goals for what they want to become. And you can turn those into what are called community health indicators and community health indicators are hundreds of measurements. You can measure things like uh, vehicle miles traveled and, and uh, amount of walkability, amount of affordability, your climate impacts and how well kids are doing in school and suicide rates in the rest rates and all kinds of thousands of measurements that measure your, your vision of, of what community health is.

Speaker 5:          12:38          Governments have tools and the tools are basically regulations such as zoning codes and building codes and things like that. Incentives and tax breaks and things they can do to encourage people to do things. And regulations discourage people from doing bad things and they make investments in things like infrastructure. They can use those cool tools I believe in a continually dynamic process. So I'll give you an example. We have a subway station and we say we want higher density, mixed use mixed income because we want people to be able to walk to it. And today we would come up with some zoning, but all these experts would figure out what it should be and then they'd fix it and to be there for 20 years. And I suggest instead, it'd be dynamic now with sensing we can with big data and direct sensing and all that, we can actually see you, the first building happens and you see what it does and you keep adjusting. Um, and so for example, you create more, let's say it doesn't look like it's affordable enough. So you create more incentives for affordability and let's say it's not that you don't feel like people are walking in offer and you can make higher uses of retail uses that have encouraged people to stay in the area. There's a million tools that we have, but we can be, so we're dynamically continually evolving towards our vision. Uh, we have no capacity to do that right now.

Speaker 1:          13:51          Yeah. Cause all of the data that we use in this process is always looking backwards. Right? I mean, right. For the most part, we look backwards. What happened over over time and not really looking to the future. I mean we tried to do that as as as it's folks in the data space, but we don't do a very good job of it.

Speaker 5:          14:05          So there's a new program developed by an architect named Peter Calthorpe. He's my brother in law. I got to reveal that called urban urban footprint. But what urban footprint is a future casting system. And so it's a scenario planning system. So what I think you needed to be doing is not only collecting this real time data, but at the same time always scenario, future casting forward. You'll never be 100% right. But the future casting, the scenario planner give you a sense of where to go and it'll give you a sense of the implications. And with artificial intelligence, in essence you can use your scenario planning and your real time data collection and keep fine tuning yourself towards outcomes and just recognize we'll never be perfect. It's always evolving and it's dynamic.

Speaker 1:          14:45          So Elizabeth, let's talk about inclusion and talk about this idea of protection of local characters. As many of you as we talk about the rise of technology in cities on particularly cities like our, our hometown of New York. Um, the question of inclusion and, and displacement and really trying to maintain neighborhood identity and authenticity with technology coming and fastly coming even more so in the urban space. It's, it's interesting that we've been a slow adopter in the urban space to see technology, but as it comes, how do we maintain the balance? How do we make sure that we're sort of protecting, you know, that local character and being inclusive? How do we do that?

Speaker 4:          15:22          Right. Well, I think, you know, this is a huge challenge and um, I want to reiterate something that you said Jonathan, uh, around the environmental process because the environmental process in New York City is one of the mechanisms that the public is allowed to touch big planning projects. And it is, I couldn't agree with you more about how deeply flawed it is among other things. We don't learn from that process. So we gather all this data that the public has interacted with in the course of one planning project or another or a particular project that's coming forward in a community. And yet we don't ever learn whether that environmental document wasn't effective at establishing mitigations that actually worked. So, you know, humans fundamentally don't like change. You know, we, we all, you know, we all, and I'm sure all of you live in New York or where were you living around the world?

Speaker 4:          16:14          You moved into a neighborhood, you kind of had a sense of what that was going to be like. You chose it deliberately. Hopefully you were able to, do you have the, the privilege of being able to do that. And you know, the idea of that we could continually change that without understanding what it is, it's probably going to freak out most, uh, most, uh, New Yorkers and, and citizens. So the question is, how do you create that level of engagement? That data actually means something to the citizenry. So in New York City we collect a ton of data and I'm sure everyone in this room understands the concept of a government Gov 2.0 and the fact that government is not always the best provider of data back to the public in a way that they can understand it. So one of the things that we need to do and really in a very global way, and my organization is confronting this every day because we're trying to figure out, well where is growth likely to happen in New York?

Speaker 4:          17:13          Um, where does preservation efforts need to be out in front? You know, all those kinds of things. It's really hard to figure that out. And if you're an average citizen looking at the data that's collected in New York, it's very hard to get a handle on what you're looking at. So this interface between, uh, the collection of data and the, uh, purveying of that data so that communities can actually engage in it is a really, really, really important thing. And it involves capacity building in the community. And this is a very human engagement. It's not really about technology. It's really about getting there and helping communities understand what tools they can reach for and how they can educate themselves about how the system works, how they can engage that system, where are the pressure points that they can engage with and encouraging them to do that and making sure that in a governmental level though, the playing field is as level as a can. So whether you come from a poor community or a rich community, is your voice heard equally in the process? We all probably know what the answer to that question is, but that's probably for later in the discussion. So when we think about urban planning, one of the, one of the law, one of the biggest things that we use to sort of dictate the way we, that we offer, you obviously use land. It's our, it's our zoning code.

Speaker 6:          18:30          Hi. Uh, there's industrials, there's some land that's zoned for industrial use, some that's zoned for commercial use and some that is zoned for residential. And generally speaking, cities like to separate uses, right? We like to separate uses because frankly we like to keep things nice and tidy a little bit. Right. That's sort of the ideas for how we did it. That's right. First Place. Um, so that said, one of the questions that I have for you all as we think about technology, um, and this is a bit of a geeky question, but it is, how is the role of technology going to allow us to really think about how we, we rethink zoning in our, in our cities and our communities crank. You're probably thinking about this really specifically in Toronto. Some thoughts on that. One of the specific things we're thinking about is outcome based codes.

Speaker 6:          19:15          So, so to your point, zoning and building codes tend to be fairly prescriptive and static and say, ah, you know, we know that in New York City, uh, cast iron pipes for plumbing, uh, what 20 while I'm already safe. So that's, that's everybody has to do that. Um, and of course, as technology improves, there are probably a bunch of other solutions that maybe achieve the same goals at lower cost store, more flexibility and so on. But because that sort of not on the list of approved construction materials, et Cetera, that are not an option. Um, now with sensors and to your point Jonathan, um, we can start saying, uh, potentially, uh, let's monitor it. Let's think about it. Maybe an example of noise and one of the issues around kind of having light industrial next to residential as maybe you're going to just do it. People with noise, let's say that, um, you can use the space for whatever you like as long as the noise level as monitored by some sense so that it doesn't recall people talking, but just the sound pressure level, as long as it doesn't go above a certain amount.

Speaker 6:          20:10          And so you have to provide a, a building and a set of uses that dampens the sound and so on. Uh, and that's monitored on a dynamic, active basis. Um, rather than saying there's just a set of, of ways you have to build a building because we know that that goes above and beyond the standard. Um, and that's true about all kinds of things, um, uh, around odor, around activities and so on. So can you actually define building codes based on the outcomes you want to achieve and then allow innovation to provide a new, sort of a clever ways of achieving those outcomes, um, and be

Speaker 1:          20:47          less prescriptive or about the way that the codes are written. And Jonathan, that's where that dynamic data plays an important role to allow you to think about those outcome metrics. True.

Speaker 5:          20:56          Exactly. So the other thing is that our culture has changed enormously. If you think about it or when America was founded, I believe 90% of people lived on farms whereby by the way, they were living, working, manufacturing in effect, doing everything all in one place. And then we became more segmented in industrialization was a very dirty process and you didn't want to live near it and it was to protect people. But today, if you think about how most of us live in work, it's in a very integrative way. And, and um, although you may want to Madden a separate significant heavy duty manufacturing out, um, we really, the way people naturally want to live now is, is in a much more integrated way. And we need communities that will reflect that.

Speaker 1:          21:35          So this week there've been three articles alone about the rise of modular construction, right? Modular housing construction as I sort of technology and the development space. Thoughts on that. And you see that as an innovative technology or trend that will change how we sort of think about affordability or even the construction space as we developed cities for the future.

Speaker 5:          21:55          Yes. So we're going to go near term part term. Yeah. Okay. So in the near term, uh, we've thought about manufactured housing is creating chunks. Basically boxes that you add up and there's some advantage of that. But then some also in flexibility, but there's a company now, for example, named dirt, which is based in Canada, which has a d I r t t is not an advertisement for them, but they have a system in which you do three d design of the space that you want. You put on cargoes and you can actually walk and see through the space. It's in real time giving you back the pricing information. You're, you're picking finishes, zero doing all kinds of stuff. And then when you're, you want to order, you push order and then the factory builds it exactly as it is and it gets delivered to you and never installation teams.

Speaker 5:          22:40          So you're really integrating design, uh, pricing and delivery. Uh, and it's much more by the way, material efficient, which is environmentally efficient. Okay. But that's still at the, that's so, and so those are walls and pieces. So there's less than the chunk level, but we're really want to go is member. I started with the analogy of DNA. So from an environmental point of view, we have to move from, we currently build out of concrete, steel, glass, copper, and all these we mined from the earth and all have very negative environmental impacts. The true solution, at least in the next hundred to 200 years to the environmental issues, we have to start building out of timber and organic materials cause timber captions. Carbon has much lower embodied energy, um, and it's a regenerative material. And for example, we can already begin to grow fungus, like kind of mushroom, like installations.

Speaker 5:          23:27          So the issue is we had the move from mining in inorganic materials to turning to biological buildings if to start growing our building materials. So to me, the, the future step is where we're designing our buildings in three d and then we're turning that not into plans, but we're turning that into DNA and we're actually growing the components that we need, high tech components for our buildings. And then when it's time to recycle them or disassembled them, you can, because they're the, they have a basic code that we have created. We can decode them and read and repurpose them. And that's really does. So it's following nature's cycle as to how we're going to solve our environmental issues and create a much more affordable though. Right?

Speaker 1:          24:06          So let's just recap some of the things that we've heard so far about technology. We've heard that number one, technology, the rise of technology and Everett space. It's going to give us more back of the public round back. Perhaps it's going to make us more climate sensitive, really thinking about how we think about the, uh, the environment going in the future, maybe more affordable housing. Uh, may help with the inclusion piece. One last thing we haven't touched on enough is this engagement piece. So let's, with what I know that you wrote a terrific piece about, about how, um, technology government is disconnected a bit from the citizen jury. How do you see us using technology, particularly how can government use technology to really engage with its, with its community base at a much more um, really authentic way?

Speaker 4:          24:48          Yeah, so I'm just going to tell a little bit of a personal story, which is that when I was in government in San Francisco, I often would hear from my employees who had seen me on the cable channel. I'm testifying before the board of supervisors about the budget or some policy issue. That was before the recreation park department, which is the one I was running at the time. And, uh, I recently went down to a BSA hearing, um, uh, sorry, the board of standards and appeals, um, in New York City. And uh, not only is there no closed circuit TV so that if you can't get in the room you absolutely do not know what's going on in that room unless someone comes out with a Bull Horn and tells you in the outer room what's going on. There is no computer screen that even says what items the, the commission is, is on.

Speaker 4:          25:45          I mean literally we are in, what is that 1980s technology in terms of public engagement. It also means that if you were a citizen who radical new idea works, you can't get to those hearings and can't engage in the democratic process in any substantive way. You have to take time off, you have to get a babysitter, you have to show up in a room where you may or may not ever be able to interact with the policy makers who are making decisions. That is, you know, we are, we are very, very far away from the ideal let's just say but, but let me just talk about a couple of ways in which technology actually changes very fundamentally. So technology voting machines, ability to do rank order voting for instance is the difference between us having a walked in two party system and the possibility of more minority views.

Speaker 4:          26:38          And I don't mean diversity views, but just any kind of minority view, um, beginning to percolate up in our political system. So there is, and that's, you know, voting is the thing that New Yorkers are not doing today that they should be. Um, uh, and so we need to figure out how that happens. This is, this is the fun, most fundamental way in which we engage with our government. But when you move into these much more complicated city planning and land use decisions that are being made and talked about, I mean, I've been following the Toronto project and the initial level of suspicion about what your very thoughtful planning process was really going to be about. It's kind of understandable because there's, we live in a world where there's a lot of distrust between government and citizens. And part of it is the sense that decisions are being made behind closed doors.

Speaker 4:          27:31          So the question is how you open those doors and how do you create a level playing field so people can engage in the dialogue. There's a lot of technology tools to do that. You know, people are using, um, uh, you know, the ability for people, for instance, just to interact on a website or whatever to put in their opinions and views on a particular policy decision that's being made. But there's also opportunities in the local community to really think about how do we allow policymakers to engage on a much, much more incremental level with their own constituents. And I don't think that's what we're doing. I mean, tweeting is not a substitute for real political dialogue. I don't think anyone in the room would doubt that. And certainly in the last year and a half, am I counting right? Um, uh, we've seen how that's just a destructive force in, in a democratic dialogue rather than a constructive one. So, so really giving folks a mechanism for having a true voice at the table. Exactly. Sort remind you something

Speaker 3:          28:34          Austin's about yeah. About transportation. Yes. Everyone's very excited. Um, about the, the, the futuristic cities. But I'm getting, tell me about my commute. Oh yeah. And I'm hearing like ride sharing services have helped bike sharing services. Like we have a few docs outside in California and our offices there, there's now a doc with scooters. So how are we going to get around cities? How will that be changing and mixed use zoning helps in regards to the commute, which we all talked about, but what, what else is in store?

Speaker 4:          29:05          Well, I can I speak a little bit to where we are in New York City at the moment because I think this is a really interesting question about technology. So we are an environmentally strong city because we use mass transit. Um, uh, and our carbon footprint is much lower because we do yet we have a subway system which is in a state of, depending on which day it is, one might say total collapse or partial collapse. We have a brilliant new leader who actually came from Andy, Andy Bideford, who came from Toronto actually who I have been. I was very pessimistic about this and he's been really causing my optimism to, to rise. He is deliberately picking a tool, a tool for fixing our subway system that is not the most cutting edge of technology. And it's very much to this point you made a little bit earlier about does government want to risk being on the absolute front edge, which many of, you know, governor Cuomo has been making an argument that we ought to try a new technology and our subway system and any bifurcate to his enormous credit is saying not until it's proven because I have to deliver this fast and well and um, I'm going to use the technology that's been effective in other cities, right?

Speaker 4:          30:27          Uh, much better than the technology which is now almost a hundred years old and our subway system, but, but nonetheless not at the cutting edge. Um, and that gets to this dynamic about whether governments can really truly adopt the most cutting edge tool. I think, um, we want him to actually make our subway system work better in the next five years, which he says he is able to do. If that's a trade off against a dream of a technology that might take us a little bit further. I don't know. That's a hard trade off to make. I think I want my eat train to run faster sooner. Okay.

Speaker 1:          31:02          More thoughts on sort of the future of technology and transportation as we look to the future for, for cities, both from planning and maybe even towards implementation. Jonathan hurt.

Speaker 5:          31:11          So, uh, the, the dream of autonomous vehicles has an economics to it, which we don't discuss much and that is utilization, right? So the car that's 24 hour utilized. So by the way, I've said to several of autonomous vehicle makers and they've all ignored me, that if I were going to roll out a system, the number one place I do it is in Las Vegas and the sunset strip, because the weather's great and the utilization is 24 hours is a very small rate you've got to map at all is a very small range that I would think that would be like the most profitable street in the world to do. But anyway,

Speaker 4:          31:39          um, but something, yeah. So, uh,

Speaker 1:          31:43          so maybe the mayor's listening, hopefully, right. At any rate, the point is all about you utilization.

Speaker 5:          31:49          So, uh, so when you, you guys are too young to remember, but when cable TV first got rolled out, all the taboo cable TV sees it's covered. He said to cities, it's too expensive to go everywhere. We are just going to start, we want a franchise, we just want to start in the places that's most profitable and then over decades literally they are ultimately forced to do universal service, which they don't really get away anyway, try and get fire out in the Bronx or something. But anyway, which they theoretically you know, have, have risen too. So I see this as the issue that uh, the autonomous vehicle companies are going to say, we want to be where it's most profitable. And so you're going to be, either you're on the loop or you're in the system, you were outside of the system and rural America.

Speaker 5:          32:33          And does it mean a whole parts of places in which there's in essence this, this is the systems going to be biased against because of profitable utilization. And so if you really want an equitable system, the subway system is a really equitable system. So I think, you know, putting on a government hat in, would franchise agreements you have to franchise with a bias towards equity? Are you suggesting that we have to sort of think about the role of technology, the future of transportation even more as a public good, continue to sort of think about it as a public good even as we sort of mix and mix and match the delivery, a delivery vehicle. So you have to think about as a public good and you have to think about and and so as a, just as a founding premise of, of all my another founding premise am I thinking America is hugely zipcode biased.

Speaker 5:          33:20          So if you live in the healthiest zip code, you are 20 years statistically you are likely to live 20 years longer than the least healthy zip code. And if you go, if you grew up in the best public school district or one of the top 20 school public school districts, you're a chance of getting into college is literally a hundred times greater than if you grew up in the worst, maybe more than a hundred times greater. So we have these enormous zipcode biases in my theory about public policy is to always, always overcome those biases and equally distribute the landscape of opportunity. So in transportation, which is the connectivity system is one of those prime functions. I basically say uh, information, uh, healthcare, education and transportation are the places where you want the ground of equality to begin. Yeah.

Speaker 6:          34:04          Well I was going to say on the, on, on the mobility side first I think, you know, I've been sort of making the assumption and I think the panel has in general that self driving cars are coming. I just want to just double check that with the audience. This is probably a slightly biased audience, but who thinks in 20 years there'll be a lots of self driving cars sort of everywhere. Okay, fine. So what, so you guys are mostly bought in, which is kind of what I suspected. Um, one of the, I think the impacts of, of self driving vehicles other than kind of the mobility we already talked about in the urban planning or safety, you know, and, and because these are computing devices that are looking at older records at once, you know, have lots of redundancy. So you know, the team at Waymo for example, which was spun off from Google is has got, you're working on very, very safe, redundant computing, you know, paying attention all of the time, which is something that human drivers just don't have the capacity to do, right.

Speaker 6:          34:53          And often choose not to do actively. Um, and so one impact of that is that we have the opportunity to give streets much more back to pedestrians and cyclists, like actual people sort of wandering around under their own steam. And so I think one of the other implications of self driving vehicles is in fact more walking, more cycling, more, more healthy ways of getting around. Another couple of implications are, you know, right now we have a vehicle fleet where somebody buys a car for themselves sometimes when they're commuting on their own and then on the weekends they have the whole family. And so thereby sort of a larger vehicle than need. Most of the time. Um, you would imagine a fleet of autonomous vehicles might come in a whole bunch of sizes. In fact, most of them will be relatively small because it will be for individuals which will also make things safer cause sort of less mass moving around.

Speaker 6:          35:43          Um, but also less congested because there are sort of smaller vehicles. But there is, there are some challenges. I think this was not an analog allied good. You can imagine if it's super comfortable to be on your autonomous vehicle commuting and you can read the paper, you can watch a movie, you can catch a nap. Uh, people might be happy just sort of being in congested traffic a lot and kind of just getting other stuff done. And we might end up with cities completely choked by vehicles. And you know, it's not clear that that will happen. But it seems like a high likelihood that we need to think about the kinds of policies and regulations around these and maybe the kinds of market forces that would not create that, that dystopian future. Um, and so I think there's some really interesting challenges ahead that aren't just technological challenges but also, like I said, some sort of policy and regulation challenges.

Speaker 1:          36:30          So Craig, you were hit on a really important point and that is public policy needs to be thinking about these, these challenges. Now this, you had something that you wanted to,

Speaker 4:          36:36          no, no, I was going to go, I was going to talk a little bit about this dystopian view that he, that you began with. I mean, Americans tend to think about our cars as our personal thing. Even in New York. And even with car shoring, sharing, we think about these as our personal thing. And if autonomous vehicles are actually going to a treat, achieve a utopian vision and not a dystopian vision, we need to let go of that idea. Right? Because it can't be one for one or even one for four. We just don't have the room for it. And if we're going to garner back the, the street and the sidewalk, um, for the public, we need not to have people believe that they're an autonomous car is going to be sitting outside their apartment building, waiting for them whenever they want to go. Right.

Speaker 4:          37:28          And that's exactly the public policy challenge, um, uh, that we have to confront is against our, um, you know, our, our other side, which is selfish and once the maximum convenience we can get. And so those, those two things have to be balanced by public policy and can they be balanced by public profit policy fast enough that the, that the use of autonomous cars hasn't said into a pattern that we then have to break. And that's the, that's I think the challenge of the timing. How do we think through the public policy issues soon enough that we're actually implementing them along with autonomous cars as opposed to after a po. Autonomous cars have begun to set patterns. Okay. It

Speaker 1:          38:11          cause that's an important point. Public policy always tends to be reactive instead of proactive are moving or changing it. Which I think gets to the point of why we need data. Let's just shift the conversation just a bit. I want to talk about data privacy and why we collect data. So Craig, you all, what sidewalk labs may be, thinking about how you're going to look at data of your residents and the businesses that are in your district, what types of data do you think are you going to be collecting and how are you going to think about privacy? You as you as you

Speaker 6:          38:36          mitigate these? Yeah, this is a, this is an issue that lots of people are concerned. This is the issue of when we talk about the planning and Toronto a little bit. Yeah. So the way we think about it as is we always start at sidewalk labs with the quality of life goals that we have and I kind of listed things like mobility and sustainability and public realm and buildings and so on, as kind of some of the things we want to improve on in terms of public life. And that's where we start. When we think about data, at least we don't think about data until we've identified that we need data to achieve certain goals. So for example, if you work through a goals around sustainability, around air quality and water quality and energy usage for heating and cooling, it turns out that the list of kinds of data that you need like the flow of water through pipes, the flow of sewage through pipes, the amount of energy consumed by a building, uh, the, the amount of heating and cooling district wide and so on.

Speaker 6:          39:26          These don't seem like things that have privacy implications. And in fact, when, when you go down the list of these quality of life goals, it's not really clear to me where, uh, privacy invasive data at plays a plays a role. Um, you know, there will be other systems somewhere else. You know, obviously we all use devices that in some ways, uh, you know, asked war and gather our private data, but it's not at all clear to me that, that the city and the public realm should be gathering personally identifiable data. Um, it seems to me that we can achieve most of the big leaps without doing that. And furthermore, I think there are ways that technology can improve people's privacy. So at the moment, there's a bit of a silly example, but if I go to a bar and I want to buy a drink, not me personally.

Speaker 6:          40:09          Uh, you know, I, I was about to say, you know, the bartender wants to check, uh, that I'm, that I'm of drinking age, I'm fine. But you know, if somebody does ask for my driver's license, I hand over to them my name, my address, my actual, you know, exact date of birth. Uh, and there are technologies based on cryptographic signatures, essentially proofs of, of, uh, of claims that allow me that to demonstrate to the bartender that I'm a drinking age as certified by the DMV or some other organization, but they can verify in a, in a technological, logical way, uh, that, that don't reveal any data apart from the fact that I'm over 21. And, and that's maybe a slightly contrived example, but there are many of these cases where in fact we think, uh, in cities you should be able to reveal much less about yourself as you're going about your daily life than you currently are required to. So, Jonathan, you've given a lot of thought to how data should play a role in planning and development. What about the privacy issue from your perspective?

Speaker 5:          41:03          So it's a little more complicated because one of the things we're really focusing on now, and we had this big partnership we put together with the Harvard School of Public Health, Columbia School of public health, Dartmouth and others to try and do a baseline assessment of our residents and see if certain interventions we're doing on health and education to actually make a difference. And you can do that on a population level and you can do it by measuring things like hospital emergency room, via ambulance, ambulances, visiting your property and stuff like that. But what I really want to know is cortisol levels and what are you known for as measures of stress and what really it is this stuff. You know, I really want to know am I, am I individually, you know, how many people is diabetes, have we reduced insulin levels are improved or whatever. Um, and that's complicated.

Speaker 5:          41:45          So I'll tell you the most interesting technology we've come across. We are not using this yet, but we just discovered this is there's a guy who measures um, uh, basically human waste. He did goes to city sewer systems that he measures the level of cortisol in it. There a batch of metal lights that show how well you're digesting what you've been eating and show whether you've been exposed to environmental toxins, et cetera. And that's a way we think to be or we, so we need to find, if not that system, some system, where are we going to actually get human health real data, but an an anonymous way.

Speaker 4:          42:19          That'd be a cleaner way to do it. Maybe you were talking about cleaning your gun, right? Yeah, for sure. I'll lose. What should the community be concerned about privacy as we think about data? What's your, what's your thought from the, Oh, I think the answer is, of course, and you know, the, the issues that we've just talked about, both of Jonathan and Craig have just talked about are our examples of how it can work in our favor, but without thinking proactively about that, it doesn't, it doesn't have to come out that way. Right. And, um, you know, we, we, um, need to find ways to not only create data that is an automized, but useful for these bigger societal goals, but we also need to create data that is accessible to the public so that they know what everyone else is seeing. Because part of the issue here is transparency, right?

Speaker 4:          43:11          Um, is that it's doesn't feel good if somebody else's collecting a bunch of data about my community and I don't get to see it and I don't understand what the implications of it are. Whereas if we can begin to think about as we go along, how do we make that data, which will be largely innocuous, right? Transparent so that people understand where it is innocuous and where it isn't. Um, uh, and then able to intervene I think is, it's a really interesting dynamic that we need to think about. But I also just want to point out that that, uh, a lot of the data that we're collecting now isn't useful to government or the private sector or to individuals at all. You know, we sort of collect it, but we don't, we're at that stage when we don't know quite what to do with it yet and how to analyze it and how to make it useful.

Speaker 4:          44:03          And I think that, um, uh, you know, we, we have been, we met with a city council person, uh, not too long ago when he said, well, you know, there's this phenomenon going on in my neighborhood and it's only everybody tells us it's only in our neighborhood of these illegal conversions of housing units. And we went to the public sector data that afternoon, pulled a big map of complaints that are coming in all across the city. And guess what, it's not just happening in his, it's happening all across the city. And part of that is just the very simple, um, uh, learning how to express that data in a way that it's useful to policy makers. So before we came out, Jonathan, you, you post a really interesting question and, and um, about this idea about enhancing data to make us is enhancing data, making us better consumers are better citizens. Talk a little bit more about that and your thoughts and your thoughts on that question.

Speaker 5:          44:56          So as you know, you know, my sense is the use of data by all of the for profits and companies such as Google's and many, many others is all being used for income optimization of the company. And that essentially looks at individuals as consumers and asks, what can I either sell them or facilitate the sales to them and, and where is there money to be made in that? And that's the function of the data and what's happened in, in America and actually I'm seeing globally is that people are, are, are thinking much less about their roles as citizens as there. You mentioned the roles as, as even voting. And he does a really depressing article in the New York Times this weekend about it. A guy trying to do voter registration and had Randall's island at a music festival. And the, the, I hope everybody in this audience has registered.

Speaker 5:          45:44          And if you're not registered to vote, please register to vote and tell your friends to register each hugely important. Um, and we are beginning to get the kinds of governments that happened when we don't care. Uh, or we don't care enough citizen engagement. So there's a measure of how you knew what a really healthy community is. And it turns out it's called collective efficacy is whether people in that community feel that acting together they can make a difference and then experienced the actual making of a difference. And, and that, by the way, it is, it can be very data enabled. We can use it to gather people together to create movements, to create information, areas of interest. Um, it's very different than turning people into consumers.

Speaker 4:          46:26          Other thoughts? Yeah. And well I also think there are, there are big problems that take big data and big, uh, policy, uh, results. So, uh, we were talking a little bit before about climate change and I've been very concerned about heat island in particular because I think our, um, most of the, the tools that are being used at the governmental level, certainly here in New York or are very low tech, they're white paint and trees. I love trees. White paint is fine, but it's not exactly a high tech solution. Whereas if we were beginning to model the natural wind patterns of New York and, and zoning, creating zoning and policy implications for maximizing that, we wouldn't be doing just a thing. You know, heat island means that we pump our air conditioning and our cooling and all those systems up, which of course makes the problem worse. So I, in that case, we've got an relatively old school technology that's actually exacerbating a problem rather than making it better. Whereas if had combinations of scientists and planners working together with data to really think about, well what are the changes we need to make in New York City to really take advantage of our natural systems to cool the city in a better way. We might actually be preventing people from dying every summer, which is what happens in New York. I want to get a question from the audience,

Speaker 6:          47:52          right. I'll, I'll just put these clothes anyway and on, on a, on community engagement. I think one opportunity is is you know we talk about all politics being local, but how about high political, you know, if I want to have a block party and shut down my block, you know, on the weekend and, and invite, you know, you have some, some folks along and play some music is a big pulmonary process that the Mip d it's, it's complicated and it said it doesn't happen very often. You know what, if it were possible for me to say I live in this neighborhood, who around me you sort of thumbs up, thumbs down about having a block party if you know the, if if things turn out, you know if people liked the idea then maybe there's an automated process for that permit to be granted at as long as there's no extenuating circumstances and and the you make it much easier for those things to happen and start by having like a tiny bit of sort of low risk democracy happening at a hyperlocal level and sort of build up from there because sort of that the stakes are lower and things can happen a little bit more quickly and and things, there's more of maybe instant gratification there.

Speaker 6:          48:51          I think there might be some opportunities to start there and grow them to do something more impactful. I'm not sure if I liked that idea of my neighbors will always say no question from the audience.

Speaker 4:          49:00          Yeah. So somewhere with that Jason has asked re outcome based zoning rules at what granularities do you plan to try this? One could envision a mixed use building where multiple tenants have to collectively share a limit on noise, odor, et cetera. Do you expect to see new cap and trade economies evolve within and or across properties?

Speaker 6:          49:18          I think there's lots of interesting, I've been questions with the idea of, of of outcome based codes. So I think we need to stop by demonstrating that the data can be collected. And then I think yeah we, there probably is some experimentation about like what does it mean? There are certain things that I held that the life safety, those are kind of nonnegotiable. Those can't be sort of negotiated within a building. There are other things that are around comfort and maybe our negotiated within a building. Um, but um, I think it's a new enough idea that there's probably a number of iterations to go through in a sort of a safe environment before I think we understand exactly what they should look like. And of course it's in the end it's a city regulation question. And so the city has to be convinced and that's a pretty high bar, that this is a better solution than the current fixed.

Speaker 4:          50:01          They also have to be able to respond to that data, right? I mean it's, it's not just a question of the public's willingness to engage in that data and have it dictate a way, an approach in a particular place, but it's also the city's ability to understand all that incrementality and how it comes together and to be able to regulate it in a way that's, that's

Speaker 5:          50:28          responsive to that. And um, when you look in some our city agency, it's one doesn't really think that's going to happen tomorrow. I just want to add, go Jason. That idea of a cap and trade economy from the building level is a fantastic idea. It could be an amazing marketplace for environmental. Good. One question before you wrap. Kind of a question from Philip. I think everyone is going to be excited to hear this. The panel talked about getting people to think as citizens and get involved. Could there be a 20% like project for citizens to get involved? What would that look like? How could, how could they do that? It's a great question

Speaker 6:          51:01          from for the technologists in the room, head down to city, that civic hall, it's an old great organization here in New York City where there's a physical gathering of people thinking about these problems and get involved in a project.

Speaker 5:          51:12          Uh, we were actually trying to do an initiative to get a million low income voters registered. Uh, I go back to voter registration, but once we get them registered, uh, we need to inform them about issues and it'd be great to do a 20% project to figures out how you really inform people about issues. So one of the things I

Speaker 6:          51:30          here, I mean hearing, just wrapping up the conversation a bit, is it, if we're linking about the role of technology and the impact of the impact on the future, it's going to involve the engagement. It's engagement from the technology side. It's engagement from the development side, but also engagement from the community, right? That it can't just be top down, that this idea that we have to look to get our provide mechanisms for the community to engage as well as is it critically important piece to this as well. Please join me in thanking our panelists. We are at time.

Speaker 2:          51:58          Thank you, Steven.
