Speaker 1:          00:06          Thanks everybody for coming. I just want to introduce a Emma Yang. Uh, she is a 14 year olds, a ninth grade student, uh, here in New York and she has been coding since she was about six years old. Uh, she's a multiple award winner for various different things. She is a published writer, which I think she's going to tell you about. And she's working on a new APP called timeless, which is designed for a, um, uh, Alzheimer's patients to be able to live a little bit more independently. So I'm just gonna, um, without further ado, Emma.

Speaker 2:          00:39          Thank you.

Speaker 3:          00:43          Hi. So my name is Emma Yang. I'm 14 years old and a freshman in high school and I'm also the founder of timeless. So a bit about myself. I love to bike. I also love cats, but my family can't have a cat because we travel a lot. So I imagine that I'm a cat and a Volvo. I love to code. Uh, but that wasn't how everything started. I actually was never groomed to be a math or a tech was. My mom always wanted me to be a writer. Um, we, I'm from like a house full of engineers and mathematicians. So we needed a historian or a writer, she said, and that's how it was initially. Um, here is a video of me at a book launch reading a book. I was published in [inaudible]

Speaker 4:          01:25          and Emma will be reading the diary, a hobby, the rabbit. I'm happy as a parent and the garden to the other side of the forest to play. We played tag was back to my house to have lunch. I introduced to my family. I was happened to

Speaker 2:          02:00          thank you.

Speaker 3:          02:05          So that was what I was around five or six years old. I was quite a writer and my work was actually published in a couple of books that are still being sold in Hong Kong.

Speaker 3:          02:17          Then one day my dad put me in front of a computer and showed me scratch, which is where you can drag and drop different blocks of code to make a program. And I instantly fell in love with it and I was coding with an hour's. I was amazed by the extraordinary range of things you could do with a couple of blocks of code. It didn't matter whether it is an application, a game or tool, a w whether it was simple or complex. It was my own personal creation that was unique and special and that I could share with the rest of the world. This is what motivated me to progress. They're building websites, mobile apps and more. Then in the summer of 2015 when I was around 11 years old, I uh, participated in something called the technovation challenge, which is a girls' entrepreneurship technology, a competition that encourages girls to pursue stem. I developed an APP called Concussion Checker, which is an easy way for people to evaluate head injury. So the possibility of concussion

Speaker 3:          03:14          developing this APP and the company business plan for the competition was my springboard into a whole different level of technology using tech to help my community and solve real world problems. I realized that even though I was 11 years old and a middle school student, I could create apps, products that had meaningful functionalities to impact and benefit people from around the world. We got to the finals, we went to San Francisco and won second place globally. Even though receiving the award was a really amazing, it was the discovery of a whole community of girls and women who had groundbreaking ideas that could change the world that I cherish the most. It changed my entire perspective.

Speaker 2:          03:54          Yeah.

Speaker 3:          03:55          This is my grandma when I was around seven or eight years old. She forgot my birthday, but we thought she was just being a little forgetful, but then she forgot how old I was, what she had just had for dinner, how would turn the TV. She lost track of time and so much more. Some of the common difficulties faced by Alzheimer's patients. My grandma is not alone. There are 50 million people worldwide who suffer from Alzheimer's. By 2050 that number is expected to rise to 130 million. Prevalence is on the rise, but there is no cure.

Speaker 2:          04:27          Yeah,

Speaker 3:          04:28          like my grandmother, people who have Alzheimer's often have difficulty remembering events, taking a new information, recognizing people and places and separating fact from fiction.

Speaker 2:          04:40          Okay,

Speaker 3:          04:41          so as the disease progressed, we would set up visual aids around my grandma's house to help. Remember we continued to send her photos of us and hopes that she remember us for as long as possible to what you see here on the right is a picture of the whiteboard that we put in my grandma's living room. Where you have on top is my dad's phone number and the middle is the phone number of the person she needs to visit as well as the address. And on the bottom it says Sunday in Chinese, which is the day that those taken on. On the left you have the iPad that she uses to look at the photos that we sent her. And so as time went by I started to wonder whether there is a simple mobile app that could help my grandmother and other Alzheimer's patients or dementia patients to remember events, stay engaged with friends and family, and to recognize the people around them in the same way that all of the things we set up for her would help her remember. So research suggests that stimulating one's memory and socializing, especially by using a mobile app or a computer, can actually help to stay, uh, to stay, engage with loved ones and look at photos can actually help to slow down cognitive decline.

Speaker 2:          05:50          Okay.

Speaker 3:          05:50          So my family hunted extensively for such an APP that we were sure must exist, but we came away disappointed because in fact it didn't. There are many tools out there, but none of them actually help patients improve their daily lives. In fact, in general, I'm very few apps are developed for the elderly due to the stereotype that's old people can't use technology. So right around that time I started learning how to code with swift and Ios programming language. So I took the matter into my own hands and developed timeless. So what is timeless? Timeless is a first of its kind. Caregiver assisted a simple APP for Alzheimer's patients to help them remember events, stay in connected and engaged the friends and family, and to help them recognize the people around them using artificial intelligence, space to facial recognition technology. It addresses all of the challenge faced by Alzheimer's patients in one single tool.

Speaker 3:          06:44          So there are four phase one core features for updates, helps patients stay, engage with loved ones by showing a stream of photos sent by friends and family through a timeless. Each of the photos are tagged with the names and relationships with the people to help the patient stimulate their memory. Today is simplified daily information and events to help the patient manage so do the lives. Contacts is a picture phone book that helps patients to contact their friends and family by simply tapping on call or text without having to remember any phone numbers. Then finally identify is where the patient can use the photos at the phone's camera to take a picture of someone's face that's in real life or an actual physical photo and timeless. We use the Fisher recognition to tell them who that is. So let me show you a quick demo of the APP.

Speaker 5:          07:36          Users sign into timeless. You touch id or face id passwords are not needed. Once the patient logs in timeless, bring us up to the home screen. There are five main features I'll take you through each one of them starting with updates. UPDATES is a feeder for central Centrify friends and family. Each of the photos is tagged with the names of the people in the photos by facial recognition. Next is today, which is a daily overview including the date, whether and next event of the day. This helps the patient remember activities and appointments, photos. She was pictures sent by friends and family. The photos are grouped by person by facial recognition to help the patient refresh their memory in recognize friends. I learned them look at photos regularly. Contacts helps patients who have difficulty remembering phone numbers and other contact information. The patient can simply tap on call or cacs to contact someone. Pamela's we'll all through remind the patient at the same person that's been called less than five minutes ago. I can defy is the key feature of the APP. Patients often have can have difficulty recognizing the people around them. Well, they identified the patient. You'd take a picture of the person and Thomas will use facial recognition to recognize that

Speaker 5:          09:03          the APP is managed by the caregiver who helps enter events into the patient's calendar and invites friends and relatives to join the patients. Timeless Circle for friends and family sharing photos with the patient is as easy as taking a picture and sharing it with the chat. I must works on both iPhones and iPads.

Speaker 3:          09:33          So what'd you saw in the demo video was an app that was under development with the support of expert partners such as Doctor Melissa cramps who is an Alzheimer's specialist at New York's Pescetarian Lulea men Adreno who isn't human experience designer and Kairos, which is a human analytics startup based in Miami. A timeless has also gone a lot of worldwide press coverage from you at the u s to Malaysia to Mexico to Spain and has also garnered a really wide reach on social media are demo video has reached over 36,000 views and within a year. And we've also gone overwhelming feedback from Facebook and Twitter. So the APP is currently under development and we've recently revamped the UI to make it more elderly friendly and cutting up the front end. And now I'm developing the back end and should be completing the APP by the mid this year. So once phase one is completed, I plan to roll out to pilot a pilot to users to collect feedback and to continue developing interface too. So phase two would include music gamification to allow the paid caregivers to ask the patient questions through Trivia and games and also multilingual capabilities in Spanish and Chinese.

Speaker 3:          10:49          So phase one is foundational. Phase two is my short term goals, but research also suggests that language and mobile usage could help to predict if someone showed signs of Alzheimer's. So that brings us to one of my longterm goals for timeless, which is whether we can use timeless as a research platform to collect data for on mobile usage. So by monitoring and tracking a non Alzheimer's patient and an Alzheimer's patient's activities, navigation, eye movements and et Cetera, we can actually maybe find signs of Alzheimer's or we could use machine learning algorithms to detect Alzheimer's disease. Earlier, the possibilities are endless.

Speaker 2:          11:30          Okay.

Speaker 3:          11:30          So my most pressing need right now is to scale the development and to drive adoption. The success of the APP depends on how many people were able to help. So Dr Carry Greenfield at the Comprehensive Center for Brainhealth and Florida Atlantic University has agreed to give feedback on the APP and also to be the first site to offer the APP to its patients. We need more of those sites. I've also recently pushed out a crowdfunding campaign on Indiegogo to support the continued development of timeless. I'm a full time student so I can't work on this all alone. So the best way to scale and speed of development is to collaborate with developers to help to grow timeless. So please help to spread word about the campaign. So Thomas has also been getting a lot of media coverage and including in between from Bill Gates that I got last Friday. And so all this attention really attests to how many people will benefit from this. And I'm so excited to see this develop into something that will help so many people in the Alzheimer's community. So you can find out more about timeless, uh, on by following it on Facebook and Twitter and also visiting its website@timeless.care.

Speaker 3:          12:41          So a bit about me outside of timeless, I'm also a mentee in the wool from mentorships program where I work with mentors at wool from on machine learning projects on using the Wolfram language. So on the left is a picture of me that I took with Dr. Steven Wolf from the summer and I also represented Wolfrem and the opportunity project run by the White House. So in the picture is Megan Smith, the former CTO and Dj Patil for the former data scientist. So some of the projects I've also worked on in the mentorships program include using NYC open data to analyze collisions and traffic data and also using computer vision to identify road signs. And also, er, I'm right now I'm working on creating a machine learning model for lung cancer detection in CT scans. Also at my school I've founded the coding club and the middle school to encourage girls to, to get into stem and to code. It's my small contribution to stem advocacy for girls.

Speaker 2:          13:41          Okay.

Speaker 3:          13:41          And I'm still a writer. I write now, I'm writing for the quiet revolution is quiet direst blog. And my next piece is due to be released on February 28th.

Speaker 2:          13:51          Okay.

Speaker 3:          13:52          Thank you so much for your time.

Speaker 2:          13:59          Okay.

Speaker 1:          14:00          All right. So I think we're supposed to do some question and answer. Um, we've got some chairs over there that I could get. So it, so it's supposed to be more comfortable. Oh, they're going to grab them for us. So the way we do it at Google, we call it a fireside chat. So we're supposed to imagine that there's a fire there and then we're going to sit down and just have this like relaxing chat. So I'm going to ask you like the question I always ask when somebody does a tech demo is like, does it actually work?

Speaker 2:          14:31          Okay.

Speaker 3:          14:32          Yeah. So, uh, as to whether it works right now, right now it's like under development. So a lot of their stuff that you saw in the video actually is the Ui works, but, and also the facial recognition is live. But you know, part of what I'm raising money for is to, you know, continue that development to its completion. But yeah.

Speaker 1:          14:50          So what would be the next step in your development?

Speaker 3:          14:53          So right now it's to develop the backend and then to really, um, build a team of developers so that I can, you know, maintain the APP through it's released when I at least it over the summer. And then she kind of solicit feedback from that because the reason why I reached out to so many doctors and brain health centers is to make sure that I can pilot this with actual patients and their caregivers and their families. So once I solicit that feedback, I'll be able to, you know, improve on it and add those phase two features.

Speaker 1:          15:20          Right. So it sounds like it, I mean, you have a lot of the stuff already finished, right? If the UI is there. Yeah. Um, and you've got the facial recognition, you did that with a partnership, right?

Speaker 3:          15:28          Yeah, I just did that in partnership was a Kairos, which is the human elliptic startup that they do facial recognition. So I've been doing that in partnership with them and, um, they've also been a really great, you know, technical mentor. Um, you know, I reached out to them in the beginning of this project and I was still lucky that they actually got back to me and become a long term mentor and with this project. Right.

Speaker 1:          15:47          That part is really interesting. I read that story about you, um, a couple of days ago. Yeah. But the, the idea of you just, you, you emailed this company that's doing facial recognition technology.

Speaker 3:          15:56          Yeah. I emailed the, uh, the CTO of the company and us. So, you know, I'm the middle school coder who are looking to do this project and we're jewel be willing to, you know, be my mentor and you know, support me with the Fisher recognition and machine learning side. And they agreed to, you know, sponsor the technology for me and to Gfsi me, uh, in this development process.

Speaker 1:          16:15          Right. And you've got it all work, like integrated. So in your app you like put it up someone, someone on the camera and it actually will do.

Speaker 3:          16:21          Yeah. So if you enroll a photo of someone and then you can take a picture of them and you'll recognize those people. Right. That's pretty cool. Yeah. Has your grandma seeing the APP? So she has seen the APP, but you know, she's in the literacy of the disease and also she speaks Chinese. So, um, that's one of the reasons why I want to, you know, get the app in multilingual because, you know, I don't want language to be a barrier or a nice thing. So getting into Spanish and Chinese in the future, even more languages.

Speaker 1:          16:47          Great. So your earliest testers are probably not going to be a grandma. It's going to be people you go.

Speaker 3:          16:51          Yeah. Hmm.

Speaker 1:          16:53          All right. So what, what kind of developers do you want to work with? I guess you'd be like the lead developer and you're sort of a,

Speaker 3:          16:58          yeah, I really hope that even if I expand the team, I really want to be working in the development because you know, I still love to code and that's really one of my greatest, greatest passions. So I really, I'm looking at like, you know, to collaborate with other people. And make sure that this gets into my goals. Hmm.

Speaker 1:          17:14          So would you say, I mean there's a lot of programmers and I think Google where we're sort of filled with programmers who are like, we grew up and we were very much introverts. We sat around in front of our computers because we didn't necessarily like people as much as we liked the computers. But it seems like you're, you're really across the board, right? You're doing the business, you're doing the UI design, you're doing the, um, development, like what's, what's your preference? What do you like the best? Or is it everything?

Speaker 3:          17:38          Um, yeah, I really like everything. Not just because like I like computer science more or anything because I really, my passion is really to use technology and apply it to problems that I see in my community. So it's not just, you know, coding the APP, but it's also, you know, reaching out to people and seeing, you know, what kind of things that they want to see in such an app and know all around. That's like really what I really like enjoy.

Speaker 1:          17:59          Oh, what's, what's it like being a 14 year old entrepreneur?

Speaker 3:          18:03          Um, I think definitely, you know, age sometimes is a barrier because it's hard for you to like go out and ask for people's help and people just take your seriously with your project if you're 14. But you know, I've been really lucky to meet people on the way along the way who have been really supportive of the APP and really believed in my ability to get this to completion.

Speaker 1:          18:22          It seems like Bill Gates takes you seriously. Yeah. All right. Is there any audience questions we can take some of those or hold, oh, we need to get a microphone. Oh, recording catch sparks. Who was it called? The other question. Some microphone. Go ahead, Hannah. Is it on? Yeah.

Speaker 6:          18:46          Um, so first question, I think one thanks for so much for coming and sharing your story and your work with us. Um, I think the thing that was really cool about the APP and as a non super or not technical person or less technical, um, really interesting how you said like ultimately the, the APP could be used for research and data collection. I'm curious about sort of what you said on the front end though, that sort of, there's some research or nascent research showing that when you actually engage with an Alzheimer's or dementia patient in like a way other than just telling them who it is or what data does that that can actually help stave off or improve their condition. Could you talk a little more about that and sort of the future for how you're gonna build that into the APP or some of the research you've seen with your partners?

Speaker 3:          19:27          Yeah, definitely. Uh, so you know, the part of the thing is that, you know, repetition is like really key for Alzheimer's patients. So part of, you know, the, the concept of, you know, seeing the updates and seeing the photos again and again is really to refresh their memory and let them see the same people but in different contexts so that they can kind of refresh their memory on those people. But not always just do the same information over and over again. It's you that's really like the concept applies to every field. Not only just engaging with friends and family, but also seeing photos. Okay.

Speaker 6:          19:57          I have one more question that's not app related, but you've done so much in your 14 years from music to writing to attack. I think, uh, I know this is being recorded for Googlers and youtube audience, um, you know more broadly, but would love to hear some words of wisdom from sort of how you've been able like your own thoughts on your keys to success or how you are able to do all these really great, very things and still, you know, maintain your interest in writing and sort of not be sort of singularly focused but sort of life and task and focus management advice would be appreciated.

Speaker 3:          20:28          Yeah, I mean like as I've know juggled all of these different interests. It's really actually how does the eye I can intersect those because you know, a law of what I do now is I write about, you know, my interest in coding or my interest in helping other people with, um, stemmed advocacy and getting girls into stem. So I think that, you know, one way to really get yourself in like so many different fields as you know, how, find some way to intersect those two fields, like writing about tech or you know, doing music, writing about music. I think that's like, you know, how I've been able to kind of grasp a hold of all those different, uh, interests at the same time. Awesome. Thank you. Thank you.

Speaker 1:          21:05          Terrific question over there. Yeah. Um, so yeah, my question is around just what were some of your biggest challenges and how did you overcome them?

Speaker 3:          21:13          Yeah, so I think that, you know, cause timeless is the first APP that I've really seen from start to finish developing it, getting the ideas and then seeing it, you know, complete, uh, I'm hoping this this year. And so, uh, one of the biggest challenges, you know, have been, you know, what is exactly the process for this and a lot of it stuck. I've been, I've been learning to how to be really eager about reaching out to my mentors about. Absolutely. I think, because you know, they are the ones with the experience. So I think that, you know, reaching out to those people and asking all the questions that you have is really important because you know, someone out there has the answer. Okay.

Speaker 1:          21:50          So your current study coating when you were six. Yeah. So on your resume does not mean you can say you have eight years of programming experience.

Speaker 3:          21:57          I guess. I mean I, when I first started I kind of started with scratch and then I wasn't as into it as when I actually picked it up back again when I was around 10 and I, you know, I actually got into and the social entrepreneurship field and saw, you know, really the impact that technology has on people because before you know it sideways like a game or like a tool that I could just kind of create. But you know, I really saw the impact and the benefit it can have on not only people that I know, people that are around the world. So that's kind of how I picked it up later on.

Speaker 1:          22:29          So you got it. You started off with the, the interest in actually solving problems and you, you taught yourself coding so that you can solve the problems.

Speaker 3:          22:36          Yeah. So it was kind of like, you know, how do I do the certain task? Like how do I make the cat move from here to here on scratch? And I kinda like went from there and just exploring. And then it was when I was around 10 that actually found that drive to create something.

Speaker 1:          22:49          I see. Did you go straight from scratch to swift?

Speaker 3:          22:52          Uh, I actually went through things like html, CSS, MIT, app inventor, and then I, when I was around I think 10 or 11 I went to his class at the flood are in school for high school students to learn how to do ios programming. And you know, that's where I kind of, and the class actually had a really big focus on, you know, how can you use your apps to help other people? And I think that's really, really inspired me. Not only just technovation but seeing going to that course and seeing, you know, I can actually have an impact using technology.

Speaker 1:          23:21          Wow. So what's, uh, what's next? Is it, is it, are you sticking primarily with this one app? Do you want to get it done or do you have other ideas you're working on?

Speaker 3:          23:29          Yeah, I think my primary focus is this app because I really want to see it, you know, get out into the world and see, um, you know, patients who are going to be benefiting from this. But I'm definitely really interested in the machine learning field and data science. It's one of the reasons why I'm working on my lung cancer project for lung cancer and CT scans with machine learning because I really want to explore, you know, the intersection between technology and health care and how machine learning is really helping us in those fields. Interesting. Any more questions?

Speaker 7:          23:59          Yes. Um, so I'm wondering is it working? Yeah. Okay. I'm wondering that how difficult it's going to be to engage a new user into using a timeless, like somebody with alzheimers, wouldn't they be likely to forget to even use the APP in the first place? How long would it take and what do you plan on doing to keep them coming back? And continuing to use the APP for their benefit?

Speaker 3:          24:35          Yeah, that's a great question. I think that this is one of the reasons why I made sure that the caregiver played a really big role in the app because you know, everything is really between caregiver and patient and a family and friend relationships to make sure that those are really hands on really close. And so, you know, part of it is that, you know, caregivers have, uh, an administrator kind of role to make sure the the patient has keep on, keeps on using the APP, keeps on engaging that family and friends keep on engaging with the APP because really it's, um, you know, people, you know, seeing more content coming in that really engages people to keep on using it.

Speaker 7:          25:07          Okay. And for somebody, for a family member, would they have to install the full app and log into the patient's account if they wanted to share or is that done separately?

Speaker 3:          25:20          So, uh, they would have to download the APP, but there are three sides that I will integrate it into the same app so they can register as a family and friend or, and be invited by the caregiver into the patient's, you know, circle of friends and then they would be able to share their photos through their photos app in order to, you know, let the patient see those photos.

Speaker 7:          25:39          Interesting. Thank you. Thank you. Okay. Anybody else?

Speaker 8:          25:45          There's one, um, your body of work is extremely impressive, so Kudos to you. I was curious to know whether or not your school is supportive and helping you work on your app. Like whether or not they've had any input, whether or not they've helped you to reach out to people and what education goals are you looking at in the future? Have you started, you're not in high school yet, are you? I just started high school. Okay. Are you looking at any particular colleges already?

Speaker 3:          26:14          A lot. Yeah. I'm haven't really looked at colleges yet, but it's definitely like I really want to go into a computer science and uh, you know, definitely looking at healthcare and computer science and that's, that's the field I really want to go into in the future as well. But in terms of my school, you know, my school has been really supportive. All of my endeavors in technology especially, you know, with uh, reaching out to people about scholarships and contests, you know, they have been really supportive of that and pushing me to kind of go and push my boundaries and see where I can explore. Um, my school, this is outside of school project, but my school does teach, you know, basic, uh, computer science. In seventh grade we did some of that called processing. It's like a very basic version of Java that we use to learn computer sciences integrating to our math class as well. So the unit, there's definitely a framework for computer science at my school.

Speaker 2:          27:03          Okay.

Speaker 9:          27:06          Yeah, I have a question. Well, thank you so much for coming. I just want to say personally, I've been so touched by everything that you're doing. I hadn't experienced of Alzheimer's in my family. And it's such a terrible disease. So you're really bettering humankind and that's something you should take to heart. It's amazing. Um, so my question for you is as we know it's a progressing disease and it's something that can start out a little bit light and then get really terrible. So in phase two are you thinking about different ways to tailor the APP to the different phases of the disease?

Speaker 3:          27:40          Yeah, it's definitely something that I've been thankful about. You know, how do I kind of personalize it to a patient cause the disease affects everyone differently. And this is one of the reasons why I've been networking with so many doctors because there are so many ways in different kinds of approaches that you can take when making such an APP. And you know, things like integrating those mental exercises into the APP or using gamification is really trying to make sure that, you know, every aspect of the patient's life is encompassed by the APP and any stage of the disease.

Speaker 2:          28:09          Thank you.

Speaker 3:          28:10          Thank you. So you're working really closely with caregivers like the house. How much more work do you think needs to go into the APP before you can do a little bit of trial with them and actually start getting the feedback directly? Yeah, I think it's mainly just finishing up the development and the coding of the APP for, I can actually release it because you know, a lot of the framework is there. A lot of the people that I know are there to kind of get ready for the pilot was actual patients. So I think that it's really just finishing coding it up and then releasing it that I can start actually soliciting feedback. Is it in the APP store already or it's not right now because I'm still developing it, but it's going to be there like mid year. Yeah. So do you think that if you had enough time you'd be able to do all the necessary work to get the app finished or are there things that you're missing right now that you need help with?

Speaker 3:          28:54          Um, I think it's definitely just an issue of, you know, time, because I'm a full time student, so I, that's one of the reasons why I really want to. And you build a team of developers so I can code evolve this bus because it's really a matter of, you know, getting people on this and developing it together that will really speed up the process. That makes sense. So what is your, do you have, do you have other friends that are into this entrepreneurship or coding or anything like that? Or is it kind of lonely at the top right now? I definitely do have friends who are like into, you know, the social justice and social entrepreneurship. I'm actually at school, I have a group of high school friends who are, uh, we're all working on this project called food for thought. And it's a, we're trying to build a platform for people who get free or reduced price lunch to kind of get Janae like kind of like a go fund me school lunch to make sure that they don't go into lunch debt. Hmm. So we're working on that as well. And you know, that's also goes into living the technological entrepreneurship and social entrepreneurship field. So I think that definitely getting more people interested in exposing people at my school to this kind of work is really important.

Speaker 2:          29:58          Anybody else?

Speaker 5:          30:01          It's a cumbersome microphone. Um, you mentioned your current fundraising model and how you were hoping to maybe hire engineering resources first, but as you look to Beta test the APP, I was wondering if you were thinking about partnering with scaled, um, caregiver sources like home instead or you know, maybe multi touch points for people who are working closely with Alzheimer's patients at home?

Speaker 3:          30:26          Yeah, that's definitely something I've been definitely working on. You know, reaching out to people, like the Alzheimer's Association has a whole network of caregivers, you know, trying to find those resources to really get the word out there.

Speaker 2:          30:39          Okay,

Speaker 3:          30:39          so what can, what can we do to make you more successful? What do you need? I think definitely just spreading awareness is, you know, the biggest thing right now because you know, the, the APP is really dependent on people knowing about this and people really engaging with the APP. So I think spreading awareness and making sure that people who have Alzheimer's are affected by Alzheimer's. You know, know about this and you know, get involved when this comes out. All right. And the, the Indiegogo page is under timeless. Yes. And I did a Google search for Indiegogo, timeless earlier, and there were two hits. There's timeless, the movie and timeless, the healthcare APP. You want the second one? Um, all right. Well, I think that that is a good place to stop. All right. So thank you again for coming. Thank you so much.
