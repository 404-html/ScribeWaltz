00:00:06.100 --> 00:00:10.760
Welcome to this presentation by the renowned David Eagleman.
Um,

2
00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:14.650
and the presentation on can we create new senses for humans?

3
00:00:15.370 --> 00:00:20.370
David is a neuroscientist and a New York Times bestselling author as well as an

4
00:00:20.831 --> 00:00:23.710
adjunct professor at Stanford University.

5
00:00:24.430 --> 00:00:28.900
He's known for his work on sensory substitution,
time perception,

6
00:00:28.930 --> 00:00:32.890
brain plasticity,
synesthesia and neuro law.

7
00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:37.030
He's the writer and presenter of the PBS series,

8
00:00:37.031 --> 00:00:38.620
the brain with David Eagleman.

9
00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:43.810
And he said one of his most impressive credentials is that he is scientific

10
00:00:43.811 --> 00:00:48.790
advisor to Westworld.
And so without further ado,
David Eagleman,

11
00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:55.730
<v 0>what I had said is that the,
uh,</v>

12
00:00:56.380 --> 00:01:00.040
the scientific advisor of Westworld is the only thing anyone remembers,

13
00:01:00.041 --> 00:01:04.930
even though it's my least impressive credential.
Okay.

14
00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:06.130
So here's what I want to talk about today.

15
00:01:06.131 --> 00:01:09.250
So I'm a neuroscientist and one of the things that's been of great interest to

16
00:01:09.251 --> 00:01:14.251
me for a long time is this issue that when we try to perceive the reality around

17
00:01:15.161 --> 00:01:16.870
us,
we're only perceiving a little bit of it.

18
00:01:16.871 --> 00:01:21.871
So we're made at a very small stuff and we're embedded in this extremely large

19
00:01:21.881 --> 00:01:22.660
cosmos.

20
00:01:22.660 --> 00:01:26.290
And the fact is that human brains are really terrible at perceiving reality in

21
00:01:26.291 --> 00:01:29.500
either of these scales.
And that's because we didn't evolve for that.

22
00:01:29.501 --> 00:01:32.620
We evolved to operate at the level of,
you know,

23
00:01:32.621 --> 00:01:36.010
rivers and apples and mates and food and stuff like that right here in the

24
00:01:36.011 --> 00:01:36.730
middle.

25
00:01:36.730 --> 00:01:41.730
But the part that has always been strange to me is that even at this scale that

26
00:01:42.281 --> 00:01:46.210
we call home the scale that we perceive,
we're actually quite bad at it.

27
00:01:46.210 --> 00:01:50.830
We don't see most of the action that's going on.
So an example of this,
take the,

28
00:01:50.831 --> 00:01:52.330
uh,
the colors of our world.

29
00:01:52.331 --> 00:01:56.980
So this is electromagnetic radiation that bounces off objects and hits

30
00:01:57.010 --> 00:02:00.560
specialized receptors in the back of our eyes.
Um,

31
00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:03.940
and as many of you may know,
um,

32
00:02:04.150 --> 00:02:09.150
the part that we call visible light is actually less than a 10 billions of the

33
00:02:10.061 --> 00:02:14.020
amount of light that's out there.
So all this is electromagnetic radiation.

34
00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:17.470
It's just that we have receptors for this part and not for the rest of it.

35
00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:22.800
So you have radio waves and x rays and cosmic rays and microwaves and all this

36
00:02:23.351 --> 00:02:27.430
stuff is passing through your body and it's completely invisible to you.

37
00:02:27.490 --> 00:02:29.110
You have no idea that it's out there.

38
00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:33.070
There are thousands of cell phone conversations passing through your body right

39
00:02:33.071 --> 00:02:35.800
now and,
and it's totally invisible to you.
Why?

40
00:02:35.801 --> 00:02:40.640
It's because you don't have the specialized receptors for that frequency instead

41
00:02:40.641 --> 00:02:42.820
of you only have it for this little range in between.

42
00:02:42.821 --> 00:02:46.150
Now it's not that this stuff is unseeable.

43
00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:48.370
So a rattle snakes for example,

44
00:02:48.550 --> 00:02:52.240
include part of the infrared range in their view of reality.

45
00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:56.260
And honeybees include some of the ultraviolet range and their view of reality.

46
00:02:56.470 --> 00:02:59.920
It's just that you can't see any of this,
at least not yet.

47
00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:02.380
So what does leads to,

48
00:03:02.381 --> 00:03:06.490
I think it's a very counterintuitive idea that your experience of reality is

49
00:03:06.491 --> 00:03:09.720
actually constrained by your biology and,

50
00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:12.880
and that goes against the common sense notion that your eyes and your ears and

51
00:03:12.881 --> 00:03:17.140
your fingertips or just picking up the reality that is out there and all you

52
00:03:17.141 --> 00:03:19.360
need to do is open your eyes.
Instead,

53
00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:22.780
what's happening is that we're sampling just a little bit of the world.

54
00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:26.560
And what's interesting is that when you look across the animal kingdom,

55
00:03:26.561 --> 00:03:30.070
you find that different animals pick up on totally different signals.

56
00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:33.640
So they have different parts of reality that they're detecting.

57
00:03:33.641 --> 00:03:37.870
So just as an example,
if you are the blind and deaf tick,

58
00:03:38.140 --> 00:03:42.430
then what you're picking up on is temperature and butyric acid,

59
00:03:42.431 --> 00:03:47.080
and that's the signals that you receive and that's how you figured out your

60
00:03:47.081 --> 00:03:50.290
world.
That's your,
that's the only signals that are telling you your reality.

61
00:03:50.710 --> 00:03:52.420
If you're the black ghost knife fish,

62
00:03:52.750 --> 00:03:56.980
you're in the pitch dark and all you're picking up on are perturbations in

63
00:03:56.981 --> 00:04:00.850
electrical fields.
That's how you're figuring out what's around you.

64
00:04:00.851 --> 00:04:03.580
If you're the blind echo locating bat,

65
00:04:03.790 --> 00:04:07.300
all you're picking up on our air compression waves that are coming back to you

66
00:04:07.301 --> 00:04:12.070
from your chirps.
And the idea is that that's,
that's everything.

67
00:04:12.071 --> 00:04:15.880
That's your whole world.
And we have a word for this in science,

68
00:04:15.940 --> 00:04:17.140
it's called the Ou belt,

69
00:04:17.170 --> 00:04:21.010
which is the German word for the surrounding world.

70
00:04:21.430 --> 00:04:25.900
And presumably every animal thinks that there,
Ooh,

71
00:04:25.901 --> 00:04:29.560
belt is the entire objective reality out there.

72
00:04:29.650 --> 00:04:33.910
Because why would you ever stop to imagine that there's something else beyond

73
00:04:33.911 --> 00:04:38.380
what you can sense.
So let me do a consciousness raiser on this.

74
00:04:39.570 --> 00:04:42.610
Um,
imagine that you are a blood hound dog.

75
00:04:42.940 --> 00:04:46.240
So your whole world is about smelling.
You've got this very large snout.

76
00:04:46.241 --> 00:04:48.670
You have 200 million scent receptors in here.

77
00:04:49.030 --> 00:04:52.570
You have wet nostrils that attract and trap scent molecules.

78
00:04:52.810 --> 00:04:56.800
You have slits in your nostrils so you can a big giant nose full of air.

79
00:04:57.310 --> 00:04:59.740
You have floppy ears to kick up more scent.

80
00:04:59.830 --> 00:05:02.830
So everything for you is about smelling.
It's your whole world.

81
00:05:03.070 --> 00:05:07.840
So one day you're walking along behind your master and you stop in your tracks

82
00:05:07.841 --> 00:05:11.680
with a revelation and you look at your masters knows and you think,

83
00:05:11.681 --> 00:05:14.530
what does it like to have the pitiful little nose of a human?

84
00:05:15.190 --> 00:05:18.940
How could you not know that there's a cat a hundred yards away?

85
00:05:19.210 --> 00:05:22.810
Or how could you not know that your best friend was on this very spot six hours

86
00:05:22.811 --> 00:05:27.610
ago?
But because we're humans,
we are used to our [inaudible] velt.

87
00:05:27.611 --> 00:05:31.090
It's not like we have some,
some sense that we're missing something.

88
00:05:31.240 --> 00:05:35.040
We're used to the reality that we have.
We accept the reality that,

89
00:05:35.041 --> 00:05:37.000
that we're given with.

90
00:05:37.001 --> 00:05:40.330
The question is do we have to be stuck in our own belt?

91
00:05:41.140 --> 00:05:42.260
And so it was a neuroscientist.

92
00:05:42.261 --> 00:05:47.261
What I'm interested in is the way that our technology might expand our own belt

93
00:05:48.340 --> 00:05:51.730
and how that's going to change the experience of being human.

94
00:05:53.230 --> 00:05:57.710
So what many of you probably know is that there are hundreds of thousands people

95
00:05:57.711 --> 00:06:00.830
walking around now with artificial hearing,
an artificial vision.

96
00:06:00.831 --> 00:06:04.220
So the way this works is,
um,
uh,

97
00:06:04.250 --> 00:06:06.470
with a cochlear implant and take a microphone.

98
00:06:06.470 --> 00:06:10.070
You s you slipped an electrode strip into the inner ear,

99
00:06:10.280 --> 00:06:13.370
and you feed in this digitized signal into the inner ear.

100
00:06:13.640 --> 00:06:15.550
And the way it works with a,
uh,

101
00:06:15.640 --> 00:06:19.880
a retinal implant is that you have a digital camera and that feeds into an

102
00:06:19.881 --> 00:06:23.540
electrode grid that plugs into the back of your eye.
Now,

103
00:06:23.900 --> 00:06:24.980
this works.

104
00:06:25.190 --> 00:06:29.330
But what's interesting is that as recently is maybe 20 years ago,

105
00:06:29.540 --> 00:06:33.110
there were a lot of neuroscientists who thought this wouldn't work and the

106
00:06:33.111 --> 00:06:38.111
reason is because these things speak the language of silicon valley and that's

107
00:06:38.271 --> 00:06:42.290
not exactly the same dialect as your natural biological sense organs,

108
00:06:42.590 --> 00:06:47.090
and so they thought the reins,
I can be able to understand these digital signals,

109
00:06:48.080 --> 00:06:50.480
but as it turns out,
it works just fine.

110
00:06:50.510 --> 00:06:54.470
People plug these things in and they figure out how to be able to proceed with

111
00:06:54.471 --> 00:06:58.730
them.
Now how do we understand that?
It's because here's the big secret.

112
00:06:59.270 --> 00:07:02.720
Your brain is not directly hearing or seeing any of this.

113
00:07:02.721 --> 00:07:07.721
Your brain is locked in a vault of silence and darkness and all it ever sees or

114
00:07:08.181 --> 00:07:10.760
electric chemical signals and that's it.

115
00:07:11.540 --> 00:07:15.140
So it has all these different cables that are plugged into it that they're

116
00:07:15.141 --> 00:07:17.330
bringing signals in.
It doesn't know what those are.

117
00:07:17.331 --> 00:07:21.320
It has no idea what we would even mean by eyes or ears or nose and fingertips.

118
00:07:21.321 --> 00:07:24.950
All it knows is there's data coming in and what the brain is very good at doing

119
00:07:25.220 --> 00:07:30.220
is extracting patterns and assigning meaning to those and building your entire

120
00:07:30.741 --> 00:07:32.630
subjective world out of that.

121
00:07:33.890 --> 00:07:38.890
But the key thing is that your brain doesn't know and it doesn't care where the

122
00:07:39.111 --> 00:07:41.870
data's coming from.
It just figures out what it's going to do with it.

123
00:07:42.140 --> 00:07:44.860
And this is really an extraordinary machine.
Um,

124
00:07:45.320 --> 00:07:49.340
essentially you can think about this like a general purpose compute device and

125
00:07:49.370 --> 00:07:49.581
you know,

126
00:07:49.581 --> 00:07:54.581
there's a lot of talk in silicon valley and hear about AI and all the great

127
00:07:55.611 --> 00:07:56.480
things that it's doing,

128
00:07:56.481 --> 00:08:01.040
but in fact we can't even scratch the surface yet of a system like this.

129
00:08:01.330 --> 00:08:06.140
Um,
that just figures out all of the sensory information and figures out how to

130
00:08:06.141 --> 00:08:09.740
correlate senses with each other and correlate that with your motor movement and

131
00:08:09.741 --> 00:08:14.110
just,
you know,
make this world around you.
So the point is,
what,

132
00:08:14.140 --> 00:08:19.140
what I think a general purpose device like this allows for is that once mother

133
00:08:19.401 --> 00:08:21.920
nature has figured out these principles once,

134
00:08:22.490 --> 00:08:26.780
then she can mess around with the input channels.

135
00:08:27.440 --> 00:08:30.590
She hasn't have to figure out the principles of brain operation every time.

136
00:08:30.591 --> 00:08:33.350
And so this is what I call the Ph model of evolution.

137
00:08:33.590 --> 00:08:37.820
And I don't want to get too technical here,
but Ph stands for potato head.
And,

138
00:08:38.240 --> 00:08:42.920
and I use this name to emphasize that all these sensors that we know and love,

139
00:08:43.130 --> 00:08:45.620
these are just peripheral plug and play devices.

140
00:08:45.621 --> 00:08:47.030
You stick them in and you're good to go.

141
00:08:47.031 --> 00:08:51.500
The brain just figures out what it's going to do with that information.

142
00:08:52.640 --> 00:08:54.830
And what's cool is that when you look across the animal,

143
00:08:55.200 --> 00:08:58.440
you find lots of different peripheral devices that can be plugged in,

144
00:08:58.650 --> 00:09:03.270
even though the brains across different animals all use the same principles.

145
00:09:03.480 --> 00:09:06.810
So just as an example,
uh,
with snake,
you've got these heat pits.

146
00:09:06.811 --> 00:09:08.160
That's how it detects the infrared.

147
00:09:08.161 --> 00:09:09.900
And with the black ghost knife fish that I mentioned,

148
00:09:10.170 --> 00:09:14.040
it's body is covered with these electro receptors by which it picks up these

149
00:09:14.041 --> 00:09:16.320
perturbations in the electrical field.
The,
uh,

150
00:09:16.321 --> 00:09:21.321
the star knows mole has this funny nose with 22 fingers on it with which it

151
00:09:21.391 --> 00:09:25.740
feels out,
the tunnels that it's boring through in the dark.
And uh,

152
00:09:25.800 --> 00:09:29.460
and that's how constructs a three dimensional representation of its tunnel
world.

153
00:09:29.910 --> 00:09:34.170
Um,
um,
birds,
this was just discovered last month,

154
00:09:34.171 --> 00:09:38.400
have cryptic chrome's which allow them to detect to the magnetic field of the

155
00:09:38.401 --> 00:09:39.151
earth.
I mean,

156
00:09:39.151 --> 00:09:42.390
the fact that they could tell the magnetic fields we've known for a long time,

157
00:09:42.391 --> 00:09:46.980
but it's just discovered how they do it.
Um,
but you know,
cows have this,

158
00:09:47.050 --> 00:09:49.290
uh,
insects,
most insects have this,

159
00:09:49.291 --> 00:09:53.730
they're all aligned with the magnetic fields,
so it's called magneto reception.

160
00:09:54.750 --> 00:09:59.040
So the idea here that,
that I've proposed is that,
um,

161
00:09:59.400 --> 00:10:02.760
is that mother nature doesn't have to continually redesigned the brain with each

162
00:10:02.761 --> 00:10:03.421
animal.
Instead,

163
00:10:03.421 --> 00:10:07.560
all she's doing is redesigning peripheral devices to pick up on information

164
00:10:07.561 --> 00:10:10.440
sources from the world,
plug it in,
and you're good to go.

165
00:10:10.800 --> 00:10:15.800
So the lesson that surfaces here is that there's nothing really special or

166
00:10:15.871 --> 00:10:20.160
fundamental about the senses that we happened to come to the table with.

167
00:10:20.520 --> 00:10:24.390
It's just what we happened to have inherited from the long road of evolution,

168
00:10:24.870 --> 00:10:27.900
but it's not what we have to stick with.

169
00:10:28.650 --> 00:10:33.270
And I think the best proof of principle for this comes from what's called

170
00:10:33.271 --> 00:10:34.770
sensory substitution,

171
00:10:35.070 --> 00:10:40.070
which is the idea of feeding information to the brain via unusual channels in

172
00:10:40.261 --> 00:10:42.390
the brain.
Figures out what it's going to do with it.

173
00:10:43.260 --> 00:10:45.630
Now that might sound speculative,

174
00:10:45.870 --> 00:10:50.850
but the first demonstration of this was published in the journal Nature in 1969

175
00:10:51.270 --> 00:10:53.880
so there's a scientist named Paul Bucky,
Rita,

176
00:10:53.881 --> 00:10:58.680
and he put blind people in a modified dental chair and the idea is that he had a

177
00:10:58.890 --> 00:11:01.830
video camera and he puts them in front of the camera and whatever was in front

178
00:11:01.831 --> 00:11:02.664
of the camera,

179
00:11:02.700 --> 00:11:06.300
you feel that poked into your back via this grid of solenoids here.

180
00:11:06.540 --> 00:11:10.380
So if I put a coffee cup in front of the camera and I feel that poked into my

181
00:11:10.381 --> 00:11:13.920
back,
if I put a triangle,
I feel that poked into my back and so on.

182
00:11:14.940 --> 00:11:16.380
And blind people got pretty good at this.

183
00:11:16.381 --> 00:11:18.660
They were able to tell what was in front of the camera,

184
00:11:18.661 --> 00:11:22.290
just based on what they were feeling in the skin and the small of their back.

185
00:11:23.130 --> 00:11:24.990
So that's pretty amazing.
And,

186
00:11:24.991 --> 00:11:27.600
and it turns out there've been many modern incarnations of this.

187
00:11:27.601 --> 00:11:31.320
So one of these is called the sauna classes.
And the idea is that there's a,

188
00:11:31.321 --> 00:11:32.550
this is for blind people.
Again,

189
00:11:32.551 --> 00:11:36.150
there's a camera here and whenever the camera's seeing that gets turned into an

190
00:11:36.151 --> 00:11:39.120
audio stream.
So you here,
this is a rule,
rule,
rule.

191
00:11:39.840 --> 00:11:42.690
And at first it sounds like a cacophony and you bump into things.

192
00:11:43.080 --> 00:11:45.090
And then after a little while,

193
00:11:45.600 --> 00:11:49.860
blind people get really good at being able to interpret all the stuff,

194
00:11:49.980 --> 00:11:52.620
the pitch and the volume and so on,

195
00:11:53.260 --> 00:11:55.540
to figure out how to navigate the world.

196
00:11:55.840 --> 00:11:58.390
So they're able to tell what is in front of them just based on what they're

197
00:11:58.391 --> 00:12:00.940
hearing through their ears.
And it doesn't have to meet through the ears.

198
00:12:01.210 --> 00:12:05.170
This is a version where there's an electro tactile grid on your forehead.

199
00:12:05.380 --> 00:12:06.520
And whenever the camera's seeing,

200
00:12:06.521 --> 00:12:10.120
you feel that poked onto your forehead with these little,
these little shocks,

201
00:12:10.780 --> 00:12:15.440
why the forehead is cause you're not using it for anything else.
Um,
uh,

202
00:12:15.460 --> 00:12:17.790
the most modern incarnations called the brain port.

203
00:12:18.250 --> 00:12:21.850
Same thing for blind people to camera sees something and then it's put onto a

204
00:12:21.851 --> 00:12:23.860
little electro tactile grid on the tongue.

205
00:12:24.430 --> 00:12:29.430
So it feels like pop rocks on the tongue and blind people get so good at this

206
00:12:29.651 --> 00:12:34.350
that they can do things like throw a ball into a basket or um,

207
00:12:34.450 --> 00:12:36.880
or navigate a complex obstacle course.

208
00:12:37.600 --> 00:12:42.600
So if the sounds completely insane to be able to see through your tongue,

209
00:12:43.180 --> 00:12:46.110
just remember that's all that vision ever is.
All vision ever is,

210
00:12:46.330 --> 00:12:50.740
is spikes coming from in,
in the usual case coming from the retina.

211
00:12:51.380 --> 00:12:54.100
It's just turned into spikes and sent back to the right of the brain,

212
00:12:54.101 --> 00:12:58.050
figures out what to do with it.
Same thing here.
Um,

213
00:12:58.090 --> 00:13:00.640
so in my lab,

214
00:13:00.670 --> 00:13:04.720
one of the things I got an interest in in many years ago was this interesting,

215
00:13:04.750 --> 00:13:08.620
uh,
question of could I create sensory substitution for the deaf?

216
00:13:08.621 --> 00:13:12.490
And so the question is,
if I,
um,
you know,

217
00:13:12.820 --> 00:13:17.530
had a person's space and they could have deaf person understand exactly what is

218
00:13:17.531 --> 00:13:20.290
being said,
um,
uh,

219
00:13:20.320 --> 00:13:23.200
just just with some sort of technology that we built it.
So,

220
00:13:23.260 --> 00:13:26.230
so here's the idea we came up with.
So first of all,

221
00:13:26.231 --> 00:13:31.060
let's say I have a phone that's picking up on the different frequencies in the

222
00:13:31.061 --> 00:13:33.880
room.
So,
you know,
here,
if I go,
Ooh,

223
00:13:33.910 --> 00:13:38.590
you can see the thing picking up on the different frequencies and the idea is

224
00:13:38.710 --> 00:13:43.710
could I turn all those frequencies and do a pattern of vibration on the torso,

225
00:13:43.721 --> 00:13:46.870
let's say.
So that whatever sounds are being picked up,

226
00:13:46.871 --> 00:13:48.970
you're feeling that as a pattern of vibration on the torso.

227
00:13:49.330 --> 00:13:53.140
And so that's what we ended up building.
And so this is the,
uh,

228
00:13:53.141 --> 00:13:58.120
the vest that we built and the idea is I'm feeling the sonic world around me.

229
00:13:58.270 --> 00:14:01.270
So as I'm speaking,
can you guys see the lights from where you are?

230
00:14:01.570 --> 00:14:06.280
I know it's sort of bright where I'm standing.
Um,
so as I'm speaking,

231
00:14:06.490 --> 00:14:10.870
the sound is getting translated into patterns of vibration on my torso.

232
00:14:10.871 --> 00:14:15.490
I'm feeling the sonic world around me as a pattern of vibrations.

233
00:14:16.690 --> 00:14:21.430
So we've been,
uh,
we've been working with the vest for awhile and um,

234
00:14:21.640 --> 00:14:22.900
and it turns out that people,

235
00:14:22.901 --> 00:14:27.070
deaf people can start understanding and feeling the,
uh,

236
00:14:27.130 --> 00:14:30.070
what is being said this way.
So let me just give you an example.
This was a,

237
00:14:30.130 --> 00:14:33.400
this is actually our very first subject,
Jonathan,
37 years old,

238
00:14:33.401 --> 00:14:37.810
born profoundly deaf and a,
so we trained him on the vest for four days,

239
00:14:37.811 --> 00:14:42.610
two hours a day,
and here is on his fifth day.
Oh,
can you turn the volume on?

240
00:14:43.240 --> 00:14:47.710
Let me start that over.
So my graduate students,

241
00:14:47.711 --> 00:14:50.050
Scott says a word Jonathan,
who's totally deaf,

242
00:14:50.051 --> 00:14:53.150
feels it on his vest and writes on the board what he's understanding

243
00:14:53.490 --> 00:14:56.430
<v 3>where,
where</v>

244
00:15:03.740 --> 00:15:06.290
touch,
touch.

245
00:15:09.560 --> 00:15:13.280
<v 0>So the thing is,
Jonathan's not doing this consciously,</v>

246
00:15:13.281 --> 00:15:17.330
it's not a cost translation because the frames are 16 milliseconds and there's

247
00:15:17.331 --> 00:15:21.500
32 motors and it's very complicated.
Instead,
his brain is unlocking the patterns.

248
00:15:21.501 --> 00:15:24.890
And the way to really understand this is to think about what your own ear does.

249
00:15:24.891 --> 00:15:29.570
I mean your own year is picking up on all the sound and breaking it up into

250
00:15:29.571 --> 00:15:33.920
frequencies from low to high and sending that to the brain and your brain is

251
00:15:33.921 --> 00:15:34.940
just figuring out,
it sounds like,

252
00:15:34.970 --> 00:15:38.290
oh that's Eagleman is mellifluous voice that's going but in,

253
00:15:38.360 --> 00:15:42.710
but in fact your brain is busting it up into frequencies and doing all this work

254
00:15:42.711 --> 00:15:44.690
on it.
And that's exactly what is doing.

255
00:15:44.691 --> 00:15:48.500
And you can think about this also with like when somebody is reading Braille,

256
00:15:48.650 --> 00:15:53.180
a blind person,
you know it's just a bumps on the fingertip,
but,

257
00:15:53.280 --> 00:15:57.530
but they can read a novel and laugh and cry because it has meaning to them.

258
00:15:57.530 --> 00:15:59.660
The meaning has nothing to do with how it's getting in there.

259
00:15:59.840 --> 00:16:02.900
It has to do with how your brain is interpreting that centrally.

260
00:16:02.930 --> 00:16:04.160
And that's exactly what's going on here.

261
00:16:04.290 --> 00:16:06.980
But I'll just show you this and if this is useful because maybe this is brighter

262
00:16:06.981 --> 00:16:10.040
than what you can see on the stage,
but here she's saying sound here.

263
00:16:10.041 --> 00:16:13.820
She's saying touch and you can just watch the pattern for a minute and you get,

264
00:16:14.030 --> 00:16:15.770
you get the difference here.
So,

265
00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:18.990
just as an example of the word touch has a high frequency bit.
Uh,

266
00:16:19.010 --> 00:16:20.180
when she says see h.

267
00:16:20.181 --> 00:16:24.230
And so you see touch and here she's saying sound.

268
00:16:24.440 --> 00:16:28.130
And so you can see how this works just by looking at it.

269
00:16:28.131 --> 00:16:30.050
And maybe that gives you a sense of how that,
cause.

270
00:16:30.051 --> 00:16:32.750
Now the reason I think this is really,
uh,

271
00:16:32.990 --> 00:16:37.280
important is because the only option for people who are deaf has a cochlear

272
00:16:37.281 --> 00:16:41.210
implant.
And that's,
that's $100,000 and an invasive surgery.

273
00:16:41.960 --> 00:16:44.870
And we can make our vest for less than 500 bucks.

274
00:16:45.140 --> 00:16:46.670
And that opens up to the whole world.

275
00:16:46.671 --> 00:16:51.390
That means that deaf people anywhere don't have to worry about something of
that.

276
00:16:51.440 --> 00:16:53.570
Obviously insurance typically covers this,

277
00:16:53.571 --> 00:16:55.760
but you still paid about $9,000 out of pocket.

278
00:16:56.060 --> 00:16:59.420
And so this is something that doesn't require surgery and as much less
expensive.

279
00:17:00.140 --> 00:17:02.760
So that's why I think this matters a lot.
Um,

280
00:17:02.810 --> 00:17:05.870
we recently had national geographic in our offices and we were filming,

281
00:17:05.871 --> 00:17:06.920
here's the guy who's deaf,

282
00:17:06.921 --> 00:17:08.960
but it's actually not because of him that we're filming.

283
00:17:09.260 --> 00:17:11.960
It's because of his daughter who's deaf and blind.

284
00:17:12.530 --> 00:17:15.080
And we made a miniature vest for her.

285
00:17:15.920 --> 00:17:18.130
We actually have a second subject now.
Uh,

286
00:17:18.140 --> 00:17:21.650
another little girl who's deaf and blind.
And,
um,

287
00:17:21.680 --> 00:17:24.610
this is the only input she's getting.
I mean,
she,
for the whole world is,

288
00:17:24.611 --> 00:17:27.080
is cut off to her that one belt is,
um,

289
00:17:27.350 --> 00:17:29.030
this is not something she's receiving here.

290
00:17:29.030 --> 00:17:32.000
Her grandmother is taking her around and touching her feet against things
saying,

291
00:17:32.001 --> 00:17:36.380
okay,
that's soft,
that's hard.
That's called whatever here.
Uh,
it's hard to see,

292
00:17:36.381 --> 00:17:39.260
but she's on a bed that's going up and down.
And so the grandmother saying down,

293
00:17:39.261 --> 00:17:43.490
down,
down,
and then up,
up,
up,
and she's just training her on these correlations,

294
00:17:43.491 --> 00:17:47.840
which is exactly how you learn how to use your ears just by understanding these

295
00:17:47.841 --> 00:17:51.030
sorts of correlations.
So,
um,

296
00:17:51.780 --> 00:17:54.480
this is work that will,
uh,
you know,
over the next,

297
00:17:54.900 --> 00:17:57.420
over the next six months to a year,
we'll have a lot more,
um,

298
00:17:57.900 --> 00:18:00.960
participants on this and a lot more data about how that's going.

299
00:18:00.961 --> 00:18:05.160
But the key is that young brains are so plastic that this is where things are

300
00:18:05.161 --> 00:18:09.400
really going to the kind of fly.
Um,
we've also built a,
uh,

301
00:18:09.410 --> 00:18:14.410
a wristband that does the same thing as the Vasper instead of 32 motors.

302
00:18:14.701 --> 00:18:18.280
It's got eight motors on it,
so it's slightly low resolution,
but it's,

303
00:18:18.281 --> 00:18:23.110
it's much less friction as far as people using it.
This is,

304
00:18:23.720 --> 00:18:25.140
this is our first subject with the wristband.

305
00:18:25.141 --> 00:18:29.820
He happens to be the president of the San Francisco Deaf Association and he

306
00:18:29.821 --> 00:18:33.160
ended up crying when he wore this because,
um,
you know,

307
00:18:33.390 --> 00:18:38.040
the whole world was coming to him.
And so he's just describing here what,

308
00:18:38.580 --> 00:18:40.230
what kinds of things he's able to do.

309
00:18:45.730 --> 00:18:49.910
So
anyway,
we,

310
00:18:50.030 --> 00:18:53.760
so we're doing lots of stuff with this sensory substitution.
We've been very,

311
00:18:54.210 --> 00:18:57.690
it's been very heartwarming and encouraging to us how all this is going.

312
00:18:57.700 --> 00:19:02.010
We're screaming along with this and if anyone's ever in Palo Alto in California,

313
00:19:02.011 --> 00:19:03.930
please come by and visit our offices.
I'll show you what we're doing.

314
00:19:04.470 --> 00:19:07.770
But what I want to tell you about now is the stuff that we're doing,

315
00:19:07.900 --> 00:19:09.190
not just with sensory substitution,

316
00:19:09.191 --> 00:19:11.520
but I started thinking a lot about sensory addition.

317
00:19:11.521 --> 00:19:14.550
What if you took somebody who didn't have deafness or blindness or something

318
00:19:14.551 --> 00:19:17.550
like that and added something on.
So for example,

319
00:19:17.551 --> 00:19:21.870
what if you took a real time stream of data from the Internet and fed it in?

320
00:19:22.170 --> 00:19:26.580
Could you come to have a direct perceptual experience is something that's new.

321
00:19:26.850 --> 00:19:27.690
So,
um,

322
00:19:27.720 --> 00:19:32.720
here's an experiment that we did in my lab where this guy is feeling a real time

323
00:19:32.971 --> 00:19:35.790
feed of data for five seconds.
[inaudible]

324
00:19:36.480 --> 00:19:39.240
did it from the Internet and then two buttons appear yellow and a blue button

325
00:19:39.241 --> 00:19:42.120
and he chooses one in second.
Half later he gets feedback,

326
00:19:42.210 --> 00:19:44.310
either a smiley face or a frowny face.

327
00:19:44.520 --> 00:19:48.720
Now he doesn't know that what we're doing is feeding in real time data from the

328
00:19:48.721 --> 00:19:51.180
stock market and he's making buy and sell decisions.

329
00:19:51.540 --> 00:19:56.540
And what we're seeing is whether he can tap into and understand or develop a

330
00:19:57.161 --> 00:20:00.990
direct perceptual experience of the stock market and the economic movements of

331
00:20:00.991 --> 00:20:04.030
the planet.
This is a totally new kind of human ooh,
belts,

332
00:20:04.040 --> 00:20:08.310
something that humans don't normally experience.
Um,
the,
uh,

333
00:20:08.311 --> 00:20:09.001
another thing we're doing,

334
00:20:09.001 --> 00:20:13.230
we can obviously scrape the web for any kind of Hashtag and,
um,

335
00:20:13.290 --> 00:20:18.090
and feel what's going on with the community on Twitter.

336
00:20:18.091 --> 00:20:18.451
And again,

337
00:20:18.451 --> 00:20:23.010
this is a new kind of experience for humans to be plugged into the consciousness

338
00:20:23.250 --> 00:20:27.270
of thousands or millions of people all at once and feel what's,

339
00:20:27.480 --> 00:20:28.680
what's happening with that.

340
00:20:28.680 --> 00:20:30.660
It's a bigger experience than a human can normally have.

341
00:20:31.110 --> 00:20:32.940
We're doing lots of things like,
um,

342
00:20:33.660 --> 00:20:37.630
taking a molecular odor detector,
um,
uh,
and,

343
00:20:37.660 --> 00:20:41.040
and hooking it up to somebody so that you don't need the dog anymore so that you

344
00:20:41.041 --> 00:20:45.640
can experience the same sorts of smells that the dog can,
um,

345
00:20:45.780 --> 00:20:47.590
and feel the different substances that way.

346
00:20:47.591 --> 00:20:51.400
We're working with robotic surgery so that a surgeon doesn't have to keep

347
00:20:51.401 --> 00:20:55.510
looking to understand what the data is with the patient in terms of blood

348
00:20:55.511 --> 00:20:58.750
pressure,
how the patient's doing and so on,
but instead can feel all that data.

349
00:20:59.740 --> 00:21:04.120
Um,
we're working with patients with prosthetic legs where,
you know,

350
00:21:04.210 --> 00:21:05.500
for somebody who has a prosthetic,

351
00:21:05.650 --> 00:21:09.010
it's actually hard to learn how to walk because you're not feeling your leg.

352
00:21:09.011 --> 00:21:12.700
You have to actually look where the leg is to understand where it is sending in

353
00:21:12.701 --> 00:21:13.510
all moments.

354
00:21:13.510 --> 00:21:17.260
So we just hooked up pressure and angle sensors into a prosthetic and then you

355
00:21:17.261 --> 00:21:22.120
feel that on your torso and it turns out this is unbelievably helpful in getting

356
00:21:22.121 --> 00:21:24.820
someone to just use it and walk because just like your real leg,

357
00:21:24.821 --> 00:21:28.300
it's just like your real egg and you're feeling what your real leg is doing.

358
00:21:28.360 --> 00:21:29.430
It's just you feel it,
uh,

359
00:21:29.431 --> 00:21:31.900
on a slightly different patch of skin and it turns out that's no problem.

360
00:21:31.901 --> 00:21:34.930
That's actually quite easy for the brain to figure out.
Um,

361
00:21:35.050 --> 00:21:38.860
another thing that we're doing that's very easy for the brain to figure out is

362
00:21:39.220 --> 00:21:44.220
we did this collaboration is the collaboration that we did a with a Google team

363
00:21:45.790 --> 00:21:49.120
in the bay area where they have lidar set up in their office.

364
00:21:49.121 --> 00:21:54.121
So we came and tapped into the data stream so that we could tell the location of

365
00:21:54.221 --> 00:21:57.520
everything.
And then we brought in a blind participant,

366
00:21:57.560 --> 00:22:02.560
put the vest on him and he could tell where everybody was by feeling where

367
00:22:02.651 --> 00:22:03.790
people are around him.

368
00:22:03.791 --> 00:22:07.030
But then also we put in this navigation function where we say,
okay,

369
00:22:07.031 --> 00:22:11.290
go to this conference room and he's never been here before.
And he just follows,

370
00:22:11.291 --> 00:22:13.540
okay,
go straight,
go,
left,
go.
Right.

371
00:22:13.541 --> 00:22:17.290
And he just follows along and gets right to where he's going this way.

372
00:22:18.900 --> 00:22:23.140
Um,
I was at a conference two weeks ago,
uh,

373
00:22:23.141 --> 00:22:27.100
that Jeff basis puts on.
And last year at this conference,
he,
uh,

374
00:22:27.160 --> 00:22:28.240
gotten a mech suit.

375
00:22:28.420 --> 00:22:32.290
So this is a giant robot and he's sitting here and he can control this mech
suit.

376
00:22:32.590 --> 00:22:37.240
And so,
uh,
what my team did this year is put together a,
a,
this is just in Vr,

377
00:22:37.241 --> 00:22:40.360
but we did this demo of,
okay,
if you were actually in the next suit,

378
00:22:40.780 --> 00:22:43.780
then what would you want to feel from the robot?

379
00:22:43.780 --> 00:22:46.510
And specifically it's every time the robot steps,

380
00:22:46.630 --> 00:22:48.880
you feel that when the robots moving its arms,

381
00:22:48.881 --> 00:22:51.970
you feel that you feel all the data from the robot.

382
00:22:51.971 --> 00:22:55.420
If somebody throws something at the robot and it hits,
you feel that.

383
00:22:55.660 --> 00:22:59.200
So the idea is if you're inside this mech suit,

384
00:22:59.530 --> 00:23:04.480
the thing that really ties you in and makes you one with the machine is feeling

385
00:23:04.481 --> 00:23:07.630
what the machine is doing.
So we had a very cool demo that,
uh,

386
00:23:07.660 --> 00:23:12.660
we're doing various things with VR where inside the VR world you are.

387
00:23:13.001 --> 00:23:17.020
In this case,
it's a,
it's just sort of a shooter game for entertainment.

388
00:23:17.021 --> 00:23:19.330
But the idea is you're getting shot at from different angles and you turn around

389
00:23:19.331 --> 00:23:21.160
and you see where people are shooting you from.

390
00:23:21.161 --> 00:23:26.050
But what we're doing with this now is we've just made this for social VR where

391
00:23:26.380 --> 00:23:27.220
you can,

392
00:23:27.221 --> 00:23:31.630
it's a haptic suit so that while you're in VR and people are touching you,

393
00:23:31.890 --> 00:23:35.200
um,
you,
you feel that,
so someone touches you in Vr,
you feel it in real life.

394
00:23:35.200 --> 00:23:38.200
We feel the raindrops or bumping into a wall or somebody throwing a tomato at

395
00:23:38.201 --> 00:23:41.470
you or whatever the thing is in Vr,
you're,
you're actually feeling that.

396
00:23:41.680 --> 00:23:44.560
Have you guys seen ready player one who seemed ready?
Player one.
Okay.

397
00:23:44.561 --> 00:23:48.350
A few of you.
So there's a haptic suit in there.
Uh,
and so we've,
we've got that.

398
00:23:48.410 --> 00:23:53.180
Um,
so we're launching this with,
uh,
we're launching this with high fidelity,

399
00:23:53.181 --> 00:23:56.020
which is if you guys,
if you guys remember second life high fidelity is the,

400
00:23:56.310 --> 00:24:00.240
the guy started that sort of high fidelity.
It's the new,
um,
you know,

401
00:24:00.560 --> 00:24:04.570
social world of Vr.
So that's what we're doing with that.
Um,

402
00:24:05.510 --> 00:24:06.321
as Sarah mentioned,

403
00:24:06.321 --> 00:24:10.910
I'm the advisor of Westworld and so the vest is in Westworld season two,

404
00:24:11.480 --> 00:24:13.820
which starts Sunday at 9:00 PM,

405
00:24:16.880 --> 00:24:21.800
and I'm calling it vast world now.
Um,
so we're doing various things.

406
00:24:21.801 --> 00:24:23.570
We have a,
with drone pilots,

407
00:24:23.571 --> 00:24:28.010
we hooked it up so that the drone is passing the pitch y'all role orientation

408
00:24:28.011 --> 00:24:30.860
and heading to the person wearing the vest.

409
00:24:31.100 --> 00:24:35.330
So it is essentially like extending your skin up there so you are feeling

410
00:24:35.331 --> 00:24:39.780
exactly what the drone is experiencing and the advantages that you can,
um,

411
00:24:40.600 --> 00:24:43.790
uh,
you can learn to fly in the,
in the dark,
in the fog,

412
00:24:43.791 --> 00:24:47.300
things like this because you are,
it's just like what the Mech suit.

413
00:24:47.301 --> 00:24:50.210
You're becoming one with the machine and you're feeling it that way.
Yeah.

414
00:24:50.211 --> 00:24:55.160
There's a lot of talk about brain computer interfaces where you're,
you know,

415
00:24:55.161 --> 00:24:59.300
I mean two of my colleague and the friends are doing companies where they're

416
00:24:59.301 --> 00:25:01.430
thinking about,
okay,
how do we implant electrodes into the brain?

417
00:25:01.700 --> 00:25:06.700
But the fact is that planting electrodes in the brain has a lot of limitations.

418
00:25:06.981 --> 00:25:11.030
The main one being neurosurgeons don't want to do it cause there's always risk

419
00:25:11.031 --> 00:25:14.390
of infection and death on the table and consumers don't necessarily want to get

420
00:25:14.391 --> 00:25:17.060
a hole drilled in their head.
Um,
so this is,

421
00:25:17.061 --> 00:25:19.640
this is a solution that's readily available right now.

422
00:25:19.880 --> 00:25:22.670
And where this is going by the way is with things like this.

423
00:25:22.671 --> 00:25:26.630
So this is what a modern cockpit looks like and it's an unbelievable number of

424
00:25:26.631 --> 00:25:27.890
gauges and things to look at.

425
00:25:27.891 --> 00:25:31.850
And the thing is our visual systems very sophisticated in certain ways.

426
00:25:32.310 --> 00:25:34.880
What they're good at is detecting motion and edges and blobs.

427
00:25:34.881 --> 00:25:38.240
What they're bad at is looking at high dimensional information.

428
00:25:38.241 --> 00:25:41.210
So what you have to do if you're a pilot is looking at each one of these

429
00:25:41.211 --> 00:25:44.240
individually.
You can only attend to one thing at a time.

430
00:25:45.830 --> 00:25:48.200
It turns out that with the Somata sensory system,

431
00:25:48.320 --> 00:25:51.510
you can take in high dimensional information,
which is why you can,
you know,

432
00:25:51.511 --> 00:25:52.490
balance on one leg.

433
00:25:52.491 --> 00:25:55.040
There's information from all these different muscle groups coming in,

434
00:25:55.190 --> 00:25:59.030
but my brain has no problem integrating this high dimensional information to do

435
00:25:59.031 --> 00:26:01.310
that.
Whereas your visual system runs in a very different way.

436
00:26:01.311 --> 00:26:04.550
And it's very much about a serial focused process.

437
00:26:04.910 --> 00:26:08.330
And so the idea is we're living in a world of big data now,

438
00:26:08.360 --> 00:26:09.980
and is there a way to,

439
00:26:10.190 --> 00:26:14.900
instead of just having access to big data to experience it directly.

440
00:26:14.901 --> 00:26:18.110
So this is one of the places we're going with that we're a,

441
00:26:18.111 --> 00:26:21.800
our goal is to do this with factories as well.
Instead of staring at monitors,

442
00:26:21.801 --> 00:26:23.480
just imagine feeling the state of,

443
00:26:23.640 --> 00:26:25.730
of the factory and this high dimensional system.

444
00:26:25.731 --> 00:26:27.530
And I'm not talking about alerts.
Alerts are easy.

445
00:26:27.531 --> 00:26:28.430
You don't need something like this.

446
00:26:28.790 --> 00:26:32.300
But I'm talking about feeling how the whole system is going and where it needs,

447
00:26:32.700 --> 00:26:35.420
you know,
where the pattern is moving in this high dimensional space.

448
00:26:35.421 --> 00:26:38.740
And you know,
um,
the,

449
00:26:38.750 --> 00:26:42.560
the key is I think with the right sorts of data compression,

450
00:26:42.800 --> 00:26:47.800
there's no limits to the kind of data that we will be able to take in.

451
00:26:48.090 --> 00:26:49.680
And so,
um,
you know,

452
00:26:49.681 --> 00:26:54.270
just imagine an astronauts being able to float around instead of look at all the

453
00:26:54.271 --> 00:26:57.170
monitors to understand how the international space station is doing,
just they,

454
00:26:57.360 --> 00:27:01.830
they feel it at all times or having access to the invisible states of your own

455
00:27:01.831 --> 00:27:06.540
health.
So your,
your blood pressure and the state of your microbiome and so on.

456
00:27:07.110 --> 00:27:08.640
All these things that are invisible to us.

457
00:27:08.641 --> 00:27:12.540
Imagine having the made explicit as you're feeling that or um,

458
00:27:13.140 --> 00:27:17.700
being able to see infrared or ultraviolet or be able to see in 360 degrees.

459
00:27:17.940 --> 00:27:22.940
So essentially there's no end to the possibilities on the horizon here.

460
00:27:23.251 --> 00:27:26.250
And I think the key is as we move into the future,

461
00:27:26.670 --> 00:27:30.750
we're going to increasingly be able to choose our own peripheral devices.

462
00:27:31.320 --> 00:27:34.050
So,
um,
you know,

463
00:27:34.110 --> 00:27:38.430
we don't have to wait for Mother Nature's sensory gifts on,

464
00:27:38.431 --> 00:27:42.150
on her timescales,
eyes and ears and nose and fingertips and so on.

465
00:27:42.390 --> 00:27:46.200
We don't have to wait around for that anymore cause that takes several,

466
00:27:46.201 --> 00:27:50.050
a million or hundreds of millions of years for each new iteration.
Um,

467
00:27:50.220 --> 00:27:51.960
but instead,
like any good parent,

468
00:27:51.961 --> 00:27:56.961
what she's given us is the capacity to go out there and create our own

469
00:27:57.361 --> 00:27:59.550
trajectory.
And so the question,

470
00:27:59.551 --> 00:28:04.260
especially with a smart audience like this is how do you want to experience your

471
00:28:04.261 --> 00:28:06.420
universe?
Thank you very much.

472
00:28:14.410 --> 00:28:19.030
The applause feels good on the best.
So I'll take any questions about anything.

473
00:28:20.530 --> 00:28:23.080
I think I'm supposed to tell you guys,
hear the microphone for that.

474
00:28:24.810 --> 00:28:25.490
<v 4>Uh,</v>

475
00:28:25.490 --> 00:28:28.240
<v 5>so yeah,
I'm wondering kind of like what are the,</v>

476
00:28:28.320 --> 00:28:32.420
the limits of the haptic perception that you have or like,
you know,

477
00:28:32.421 --> 00:28:35.240
where does it break down or is there,
is there like,
um,

478
00:28:35.640 --> 00:28:37.330
kind of like fatigue after a while?

479
00:28:37.331 --> 00:28:42.331
Like you just get tired or are you start getting numb to the perceptions are

480
00:28:43.020 --> 00:28:44.580
<v 0>great.
Great.
Let me answer this in two ways.</v>

481
00:28:44.581 --> 00:28:47.460
So as far as the getting numb part goes,
no.

482
00:28:48.420 --> 00:28:51.070
What's interesting is when,

483
00:28:51.120 --> 00:28:54.840
when I first put the vest on everyday or the wristband,
you know,
for the first,

484
00:28:54.841 --> 00:28:55.170
I dunno,

485
00:28:55.170 --> 00:28:58.080
let's say 60 seconds I'm feeling and I'm really aware of it and then it fades

486
00:28:58.081 --> 00:28:58.831
into background,

487
00:28:58.831 --> 00:29:01.860
but it's not because I'm getting numb because if anything happens is unexpected,

488
00:29:02.040 --> 00:29:03.270
I,
I immediately feel it.

489
00:29:03.600 --> 00:29:08.250
So instead it's just like the feeling of your shoe on your left foot,

490
00:29:08.550 --> 00:29:10.740
you're not paying attention to,
but if suddenly you get a pebble in it,

491
00:29:10.741 --> 00:29:13.410
then you're paying attention to it or you can attend to it right now and

492
00:29:13.411 --> 00:29:17.610
thinking about how your foot fields,
um,
so it's exactly like that with the vest.

493
00:29:17.611 --> 00:29:20.250
And the key thing about using the skin is that,
you know,

494
00:29:20.251 --> 00:29:24.960
the skin is the largest organ of the body and it's incredibly sophisticated.

495
00:29:24.960 --> 00:29:29.070
It's got all these receptor types in it.
This is unbelievably useful Oregon,

496
00:29:29.071 --> 00:29:32.850
but we just don't use it for anything.
The joke in the lab is that a,

497
00:29:33.300 --> 00:29:36.660
is that we don't call this the waste for nothing.
It's just totally not used.

498
00:29:36.990 --> 00:29:39.990
And so,
um,
yeah.
Anyway,

499
00:29:39.991 --> 00:29:44.991
you don't fatigue as far as the limits go of what kind of data we can pass into

500
00:29:45.161 --> 00:29:46.720
it.
We don't know yet.

501
00:29:47.050 --> 00:29:51.910
What is clear is that some things you learn instantly.
Just as an example,

502
00:29:51.911 --> 00:29:55.240
the thing we did with,
with blind people where there's Lidar,

503
00:29:55.241 --> 00:29:58.030
which knows the location of everything and the guy who's wearing it,

504
00:29:58.060 --> 00:29:58.691
he could tell,
okay,

505
00:29:58.691 --> 00:30:01.510
there's someone walking up on my left and now the person's walking around behind

506
00:30:01.511 --> 00:30:04.840
me and so on no learning.
I mean it was,

507
00:30:04.900 --> 00:30:08.800
it was instantly he got it with something like deafness,

508
00:30:09.130 --> 00:30:12.190
people have to,
people immediately do you get some things right away,

509
00:30:12.191 --> 00:30:15.280
like if we present to the wristband or the vest,
you know,

510
00:30:15.281 --> 00:30:18.670
dog bark or smoke detector,
a baby crying or whatever,
they get that right away.

511
00:30:19.090 --> 00:30:22.840
Um,
but other things are more challenging than it feels to me.

512
00:30:22.841 --> 00:30:26.230
Like the more removed the data set is like,

513
00:30:26.231 --> 00:30:28.600
let's say I'm doing factory data,
uh,

514
00:30:28.601 --> 00:30:33.040
it just has to be something where you train and learn on it.
Thanks.
Thanks.

515
00:30:34.060 --> 00:30:35.560
Let's go over.
Let's switch sides.
Yeah.

516
00:30:35.680 --> 00:30:40.330
<v 6>Um,
is there any kind of like,
promise having your skin do double duty?</v>

517
00:30:40.331 --> 00:30:41.164
Like do you like,

518
00:30:41.230 --> 00:30:44.700
could you get so used to like hearing through your skin that like if someone

519
00:30:44.701 --> 00:30:47.230
were to touch you,
like Kinda hear something then

520
00:30:47.520 --> 00:30:48.181
<v 0>great question.</v>

521
00:30:48.181 --> 00:30:52.590
The answer probably is no in the sense that the way that you hear is this very

522
00:30:52.591 --> 00:30:55.770
high dimensional pattern and so some would have to touch you in a very

523
00:30:55.771 --> 00:31:00.180
particular way,
every 16 milliseconds.
So that's why we haven't run into that yet.

524
00:31:00.181 --> 00:31:04.140
I don't,
I don't,
I don't foresee that happening.
Um,
yeah,
that's the answer.

525
00:31:05.130 --> 00:31:08.250
And,
and you know,
the general story is that,
like I said,

526
00:31:08.251 --> 00:31:11.700
because we all were clothes nowadays and so on,
it's just,
it's not really,

527
00:31:11.730 --> 00:31:14.340
we're not utilizing this for much of anything.
By the way.

528
00:31:14.341 --> 00:31:18.090
Other people have come up with very clever ways of using,
you know,

529
00:31:18.150 --> 00:31:23.040
a hearing or a hearing or sight or anything like that to pass the information.

530
00:31:23.041 --> 00:31:25.980
But the problem is those are senses that you're using.

531
00:31:25.981 --> 00:31:30.120
You actually need to use your,
your vision and your hearing.
Um,

532
00:31:30.240 --> 00:31:32.100
and the thing with that brain port that I showed you,

533
00:31:32.101 --> 00:31:33.270
the thing that sits on the tongue,

534
00:31:34.080 --> 00:31:36.510
it's a great proof of principle for sensory substitution,

535
00:31:36.511 --> 00:31:39.570
but it's really stupid as a device because you can't eat and you can't talk when

536
00:31:39.571 --> 00:31:40.404
it's in your mouth.

537
00:31:40.680 --> 00:31:45.680
So this is why I really wanted to do something that was totally unobtrusive as

538
00:31:46.141 --> 00:31:47.430
in you guys didn't even know I was wearing.

539
00:31:47.431 --> 00:31:50.490
It was just something worn under the clothing and something that takes advantage

540
00:31:50.491 --> 00:31:53.110
of all this skin that you're not using for anything.
Yeah.

541
00:31:53.700 --> 00:31:56.280
<v 6>Yeah.
Thanks a lot from doing this talk.
This is extremely interesting.</v>

542
00:31:56.460 --> 00:32:00.610
I was curious to learn more about the learning process because if you make a

543
00:32:00.611 --> 00:32:01.770
knowledge with machine learning,

544
00:32:01.771 --> 00:32:04.560
there's usually need to be some label data and he's a train.

545
00:32:04.561 --> 00:32:07.430
This prediction is extremely wrong.
This is predispositions.
Okay.

546
00:32:07.770 --> 00:32:08.410
So I was curious,

547
00:32:08.410 --> 00:32:12.960
have you started thinking of how to make the interpretation like how to make

548
00:32:12.990 --> 00:32:16.410
brain pick up the interpretation faster,
better?
Is there Craig?

549
00:32:16.411 --> 00:32:17.340
So how does it work?

550
00:32:17.490 --> 00:32:19.440
<v 0>Yeah,
thank you.
Great question.
Um,</v>

551
00:32:19.620 --> 00:32:23.220
so of course you know that the difference between artificial neural networks and

552
00:32:23.221 --> 00:32:26.370
brain are all that works is a miles a difference,
right?

553
00:32:26.400 --> 00:32:27.270
Because with an artificial one,

554
00:32:27.280 --> 00:32:30.330
you need millions of exemplars and you just don't need that with the brain.

555
00:32:30.360 --> 00:32:33.630
But the way that we train,
um,
deaf people for example,

556
00:32:34.470 --> 00:32:39.060
is we'll present a,
a,
a word to let's say the wristband and invest.

557
00:32:39.340 --> 00:32:40.173
So you,

558
00:32:40.580 --> 00:32:44.390
and then you see four choices on the screen and you have to guess which word you

559
00:32:44.391 --> 00:32:46.280
just felt.
And at first you have no idea.

560
00:32:46.281 --> 00:32:49.250
So you making guests and you're given feedback about what's right and wrong.

561
00:32:49.310 --> 00:32:52.250
This is just like these foreign language learning programs where you get

562
00:32:52.251 --> 00:32:55.730
feedback and you start getting better and better at it every day.
Um,

563
00:32:56.840 --> 00:33:00.380
the reason we do those sorts of tests so that we can quantify exactly how things

564
00:33:00.381 --> 00:33:04.550
are going,
but the real way that deaf people learn is two of them.

565
00:33:04.580 --> 00:33:08.060
One is they watch your lips and as they're watching your lips and feeling it,

566
00:33:08.061 --> 00:33:10.850
they're making the correlation that way between what they're seeing and what

567
00:33:10.851 --> 00:33:14.870
they're feeling.
And the other way,
which is even better is when they vocalize,

568
00:33:14.871 --> 00:33:17.600
they say something and they feel it.
And that's by the way,

569
00:33:17.601 --> 00:33:20.230
how you train up your own ears when you were a baby.
You know,

570
00:33:20.240 --> 00:33:24.980
you babble and you're hearing it and that closes the loop and you figure out how

571
00:33:24.981 --> 00:33:29.490
to use your ears.
And that's what's going on here.
Thank you.
Yes.

572
00:33:30.420 --> 00:33:35.420
<v 7>So you talked a lot about substituting a new senses for an organ then maybe it</v>

573
00:33:35.700 --> 00:33:39.710
doesn't exist for someone or introducing some new sense.
Uh,

574
00:33:39.760 --> 00:33:43.390
do you know of any work about expanding a sense that you already have such as

575
00:33:43.930 --> 00:33:45.790
seeing wider range of lighter hearing,

576
00:33:45.791 --> 00:33:48.160
new things are getting better at touching things?

577
00:33:48.280 --> 00:33:52.060
<v 0>Yeah,
so thank you for the question.
Asked me this question again.
In three months,</v>

578
00:33:52.061 --> 00:33:56.110
I'll be able to tell you more than I can tell you right now.
But,
um,

579
00:33:56.980 --> 00:34:01.360
my deep interest is in,
uh,
for example,

580
00:34:02.090 --> 00:34:04.480
the,
with the visual spectrum that I showed at the beginning,

581
00:34:05.860 --> 00:34:08.500
if we were born 500 years ago,

582
00:34:08.501 --> 00:34:11.500
it would have been a very different situation because the world was unmapped

583
00:34:11.550 --> 00:34:14.410
[inaudible] you would have been able to sail around and find new lands.

584
00:34:14.411 --> 00:34:17.650
Now we can't do that.
Uh,
everything is already known in the world,

585
00:34:18.190 --> 00:34:22.870
but it's not true for the visual spectrum.
For the,
let's say the em spectrum.

586
00:34:23.170 --> 00:34:28.170
Like I feel like I get to be a pioneer and walk around on this 10 billion size

587
00:34:30.380 --> 00:34:35.380
grid to find out what is meaningful to us as humans on that credit and no one's

588
00:34:35.561 --> 00:34:36.680
ever walked around.
And then before that,

589
00:34:36.681 --> 00:34:40.270
obviously we build machines in our cars to pick up on radio waves.

590
00:34:40.270 --> 00:34:42.430
We build machines and hospitals pickup on x rays and so on.

591
00:34:42.480 --> 00:34:44.620
We have various things that pick up on different parts here,

592
00:34:45.130 --> 00:34:48.550
but there's a difference when you're actually a human walking around in this

593
00:34:48.551 --> 00:34:52.030
spectrum.
Just as an example,
um,

594
00:34:52.210 --> 00:34:56.230
some friends of mine makes microwave cameras that sit on satellites for various

595
00:34:56.231 --> 00:34:56.680
reasons,

596
00:34:56.680 --> 00:35:00.940
but what they discovered totally accidentally is that you can tell if water is

597
00:35:00.941 --> 00:35:04.450
drinkable or polluted just by looking at it in the microwave range.

598
00:35:04.451 --> 00:35:06.130
But none of them knew that before.
Why?

599
00:35:06.131 --> 00:35:09.640
Because you need to sort of be a human who cares about these things.
Say,
Oh look,

600
00:35:09.641 --> 00:35:13.420
there's this thing here.
And this training said,
the point is,
I feel like there's,

601
00:35:15.040 --> 00:35:16.130
if I had to make a guess,

602
00:35:16.131 --> 00:35:20.800
I'd guess there's 30 Nobel prizes that are hidden along the spectrum for people

603
00:35:20.801 --> 00:35:24.820
to just make discoveries about cool stuff.
So,
so,
uh,

604
00:35:24.840 --> 00:35:27.610
I should mention one of the things that we're doing is we're releasing the vest

605
00:35:27.611 --> 00:35:28.140
and the,

606
00:35:28.140 --> 00:35:32.320
and the wristband with an open API so people can put in whatever data streams

607
00:35:32.321 --> 00:35:35.020
they want.
They can work cameras for different parts of the range,

608
00:35:35.170 --> 00:35:36.850
hearing for different parts of the hearing,

609
00:35:37.220 --> 00:35:39.910
anything like that and go around and see what's up

610
00:35:40.010 --> 00:35:42.800
<v 8>there in the world.
Thank you.
Thanks so much.</v>

611
00:35:44.280 --> 00:35:45.120
<v 2>Hi.
Um,</v>

612
00:35:45.450 --> 00:35:49.710
I'm working on the entire section of Vr and empathy and I think a lot about

613
00:35:49.790 --> 00:35:51.660
perception,
perception of emotion.

614
00:35:52.170 --> 00:35:57.170
And I was wondering if you think we could use a similar device to help people

615
00:35:57.511 --> 00:36:00.930
understand the other person's emotion or the emotions around them.

616
00:36:01.520 --> 00:36:02.360
<v 0>Thank you for the question.</v>

617
00:36:02.390 --> 00:36:06.470
It would totally depend on having a sensor that can do that.
In other words,

618
00:36:06.471 --> 00:36:08.930
if I had a machine that did,

619
00:36:08.931 --> 00:36:12.800
that's a facial recognition or pitch recognition of voice or whatever and could

620
00:36:12.801 --> 00:36:13.221
figure it out,

621
00:36:13.221 --> 00:36:16.670
the answer is that it's easy to feed that in so that I'd become aware,

622
00:36:16.671 --> 00:36:20.480
more aware of how somebody is feeling,
but,
but I,

623
00:36:20.570 --> 00:36:25.010
I would need the sensor in order to tell me what the right answer is to feed it

624
00:36:25.011 --> 00:36:27.770
in.
Um,
and the other thing is I've gotten,

625
00:36:27.860 --> 00:36:30.590
I've gotten a version of this question several times about whether this would be

626
00:36:30.591 --> 00:36:33.350
useful for autism,
probably not.

627
00:36:33.620 --> 00:36:37.130
And the reason is many kids with autism have what's called sensory processing

628
00:36:37.131 --> 00:36:41.780
disorder where they can't stand the feel of things like the clothes are wearing

629
00:36:41.781 --> 00:36:42.141
or whatever.

630
00:36:42.141 --> 00:36:45.920
And so having all this buzzing probably wouldn't work for them unfortunately.
Um,

631
00:36:46.010 --> 00:36:46.370
but anyway,

632
00:36:46.370 --> 00:36:50.300
that's the answer about empathy or anything else is if there's a way to sense
it,

633
00:36:50.301 --> 00:36:53.300
then it's very easy to feed it in.
So you're getting that data.

634
00:36:53.800 --> 00:36:58.690
<v 2>If I can have a second question.
So you work on sensory data.
Um,</v>

635
00:36:59.260 --> 00:37:02.210
do you think it can help change the way brain works?

636
00:37:02.230 --> 00:37:04.120
Like if there's a brain disorder,

637
00:37:04.570 --> 00:37:09.130
can these devices be a compliment to buy?
Have you process data?

638
00:37:09.630 --> 00:37:09.880
Okay.

639
00:37:09.880 --> 00:37:11.800
<v 0>Yeah,
I totally think so.
Um,</v>

640
00:37:12.520 --> 00:37:17.290
I mean this is just one example of many,
but the thing about the prosthetic leg,

641
00:37:17.560 --> 00:37:20.680
it's that you just don't have that data anymore coming from your leg.

642
00:37:20.890 --> 00:37:25.210
And it just took us,
you know,
two hours to be able to just fix that.

643
00:37:25.211 --> 00:37:29.950
So now somebody can feel their leg is though it's a real leg.
Um,

644
00:37:30.010 --> 00:37:31.210
and I think,
you know,

645
00:37:31.211 --> 00:37:35.230
one of the big problems with stroke with Parkinson's disease and so on is losing

646
00:37:35.231 --> 00:37:39.640
sensation in a limb.
So forget prosthetics for a minute.
Just,
you know,

647
00:37:39.641 --> 00:37:42.220
just hooking this up so that you can feel what your limb is doing.

648
00:37:42.221 --> 00:37:46.030
So it doesn't just feel like this big numb thing,
but you're feeling it.
That's a,

649
00:37:46.031 --> 00:37:47.110
that's another example.

650
00:37:47.820 --> 00:37:49.000
<v 8>Thank you.
Thanks very much.</v>

651
00:37:50.800 --> 00:37:55.450
<v 2>I'm high.
So I find the navigation applications are interesting and I,</v>

652
00:37:55.480 --> 00:37:59.140
my question is,
um,
before we get to the,
um,

653
00:37:59.440 --> 00:38:03.580
the airplanes and spacecraft navigation,
not that that's an important,

654
00:38:03.581 --> 00:38:08.200
like is there an application to more immediates navigation needs?
Uh,
for example,

655
00:38:08.201 --> 00:38:11.830
like I can't tell you how many times I almost got hit by a car looking at Google

656
00:38:11.831 --> 00:38:16.780
maps on my phone,
no offense to Google.
Um,
or like,
um,

657
00:38:17.320 --> 00:38:19.570
I navigating back to safety.

658
00:38:19.571 --> 00:38:23.770
Like I do have a friend who got lost skiing cause he lost his way.
Um,

659
00:38:23.830 --> 00:38:27.720
or like that episode of the Office by Michael drives his car into a lake.
Uh,

660
00:38:29.050 --> 00:38:31.690
dups.
Um,
so I was wondering if there's like,

661
00:38:31.691 --> 00:38:34.960
I need more immediate applications that we can use in our daily lives.

662
00:38:35.290 --> 00:38:36.070
<v 0>Yeah.
The</v>

663
00:38:36.070 --> 00:38:39.020
<v 9>thing.
Thank you for asking me.
The thing that we did with the,</v>

664
00:38:39.021 --> 00:38:43.250
the blind participant where he's getting navigation directions that way.

665
00:38:43.770 --> 00:38:44.260
No.

666
00:38:44.260 --> 00:38:48.160
<v 0>In the office.
Right,
exactly.
And as I said,
that's a product.</v>

667
00:38:48.161 --> 00:38:52.730
We're doing a collaboration with Google.
Um,
I,
I'm uh,

668
00:38:52.810 --> 00:38:56.080
now transferring that over to the wristband and so I built the risk man with

669
00:38:56.081 --> 00:38:57.010
eight motors.

670
00:38:57.310 --> 00:39:00.670
So you have the cardinal directions plus the in between directions and it

671
00:39:00.671 --> 00:39:03.880
doesn't have to be someone that's blind.
It can be for any reason at all.
Uh,

672
00:39:04.210 --> 00:39:06.780
first of all,
if there's any kind of detection about what's around you,

673
00:39:06.781 --> 00:39:09.130
you can know,
oh,
there's someone to my right,
there's someone behind me,

674
00:39:09.131 --> 00:39:12.790
there's whatever.
Or you can be told,
oh yeah,
when you get up here,
turn right,

675
00:39:12.791 --> 00:39:14.740
turn left,
blah,
blah.
That sort of thing.

676
00:39:15.630 --> 00:39:19.320
<v 9>Cause I remember thinking like,
I wish Google math had like a vibration thing,</v>

677
00:39:19.330 --> 00:39:19.490
but,

678
00:39:19.490 --> 00:39:22.700
or like it just vibrated on my rest that I would know which way to turn instead

679
00:39:22.701 --> 00:39:24.350
of having to like look down on my phone.

680
00:39:24.440 --> 00:39:27.050
<v 0>Exactly.
Right.
That's exactly right.
And you know,</v>

681
00:39:27.051 --> 00:39:31.730
I'll just mention for clarification that,
um,
yeah,
so as people say,
oh,

682
00:39:31.731 --> 00:39:34.910
well wait,
doesn't the like the apple Iwatch do stuff like this?

683
00:39:34.911 --> 00:39:39.050
But of course it doesn't.
It just has a single motor in it.
And so by having the,

684
00:39:39.051 --> 00:39:40.880
the spatial pattern and the motors,

685
00:39:41.090 --> 00:39:44.690
one of the things that's trivial for the brain to learn is,
oh,
you know,
okay.

686
00:39:44.691 --> 00:39:47.570
Yeah.
Got It.
That's left.
That's the right that's behind me.
That's in front of me.

687
00:39:47.740 --> 00:39:51.800
Yeah.
That's easy.
So,
okay.
Okay.
Thank you.
Yeah,
thanks.
Yes.

688
00:39:52.300 --> 00:39:52.930
<v 9>Hi.
Uh,</v>

689
00:39:52.930 --> 00:39:56.980
how much does your team know about how difficult it is for someone to switch

690
00:39:56.981 --> 00:40:00.810
between different kinds of sensory augmentation?
In other words,
uh,

691
00:40:00.910 --> 00:40:04.750
will I be limited to a single sensory augmentation out in my vest?

692
00:40:05.470 --> 00:40:08.110
<v 0>That's a great question.
We don't know the answer to that yet.</v>

693
00:40:08.620 --> 00:40:13.060
Here's what I can tell you.
The brain has what are called Schema where it's like,

694
00:40:13.061 --> 00:40:16.450
okay,
in this situation,
this is what this data stream is.
And that situation,

695
00:40:16.451 --> 00:40:18.250
this is what I mean.
I'll just give you an example.

696
00:40:18.251 --> 00:40:20.420
A few months ago if you wanted to go,

697
00:40:20.421 --> 00:40:22.690
I was throwing a football around with some friends and I,

698
00:40:22.720 --> 00:40:25.660
it hit my vehicle and knocked the rear view mirror off.

699
00:40:26.050 --> 00:40:28.870
So the next day or that afternoon,

700
00:40:28.871 --> 00:40:32.560
I got in my vehicle and I was driving and I noticed I kept making eye movements

701
00:40:32.620 --> 00:40:36.010
up here and I was seeing into the trees and I thought,
what am I doing?

702
00:40:36.011 --> 00:40:39.100
And it's because of course I'm used to looking that way to see behind me.

703
00:40:39.610 --> 00:40:41.980
But I only do that when I'm sitting in my car seat.

704
00:40:42.010 --> 00:40:43.610
I would never do that walking around the street.

705
00:40:43.610 --> 00:40:45.670
I've never suddenly look there to see behind me.

706
00:40:46.090 --> 00:40:50.380
So my brain had unconscious learned a Schema,
which is when I'm in this context,

707
00:40:50.590 --> 00:40:54.610
then I've got these completely different,
uh,
you know,
sensory capacities.

708
00:40:54.850 --> 00:40:56.590
So the point is the brain's always doing this.

709
00:40:56.591 --> 00:41:00.490
So it may be possible to learn more than one.
We don't know.

710
00:41:00.491 --> 00:41:01.510
We just haven't tried that.

711
00:41:01.750 --> 00:41:06.580
My best guess for what would be easiest is to have like two wristbands or you

712
00:41:06.581 --> 00:41:09.850
know,
an ankle bracelet or whatever.
We're building all sorts of other uh,

713
00:41:09.880 --> 00:41:12.220
form factors too.
Um,

714
00:41:12.550 --> 00:41:15.670
and so depending on the apps that you wanted,

715
00:41:15.671 --> 00:41:19.480
like if there were mainly two that you wanted possibly it would be easiest just

716
00:41:19.481 --> 00:41:23.800
to have them on separate parts of the body which go to separate parts of the

717
00:41:23.801 --> 00:41:26.980
brain.
They can ask me that again in six months.

718
00:41:26.981 --> 00:41:29.050
I might have more data to tell you.
Thanks so much.

719
00:41:29.590 --> 00:41:31.250
<v 9>Uh,
I have two questions.</v>

720
00:41:31.251 --> 00:41:35.180
What happens to the visual cortex of someone who's born blind?

721
00:41:35.420 --> 00:41:39.440
And second,
if you're translating,
uh,

722
00:41:39.470 --> 00:41:44.470
auditory signals to a or visual signals to auditory for someone who's blind,

723
00:41:44.691 --> 00:41:46.700
do you see activity in that area of the brain?

724
00:41:47.410 --> 00:41:48.243
<v 0>Great questions.</v>

725
00:41:49.390 --> 00:41:49.590
<v 8>Okay.</v>

726
00:41:49.590 --> 00:41:52.380
<v 0>And this is actually the topic of my next book that comes out next year called</v>

727
00:41:52.381 --> 00:41:54.360
live wired,
which is to say,

728
00:41:55.300 --> 00:41:55.900
<v 8>okay,</v>

729
00:41:55.900 --> 00:41:59.020
<v 0>what you have are these cables that plug into the CORTEX.</v>

730
00:41:59.200 --> 00:42:03.460
So from the eyes you have data cables that go and they plug him back here and

731
00:42:03.461 --> 00:42:06.700
then we say,
oh,
that's the visual cortex.
But in fact,

732
00:42:06.880 --> 00:42:09.940
the only reason we ever think of that as the digital core text is just because

733
00:42:09.941 --> 00:42:12.010
that's where the information goes and becomes a visual cortex.

734
00:42:12.250 --> 00:42:15.700
But if you are born blind,
it's no longer the visual cortex.

735
00:42:15.850 --> 00:42:19.900
Instead it gets taken over by hearing,
by touch,

736
00:42:19.930 --> 00:42:22.390
by vocabulary words,
by all of that stuff.
Why?

737
00:42:22.750 --> 00:42:25.390
Because the Cortex is actually the same everywhere,

738
00:42:25.391 --> 00:42:29.230
all over the brain and what it looks like and what we call in textbooks.

739
00:42:29.231 --> 00:42:31.540
It's just a matter of what kind of data is plugging into it.

740
00:42:31.870 --> 00:42:35.370
So back in the early nineties,
in fact,
um,
Rogowska Sore,

741
00:42:35.371 --> 00:42:40.000
a colleague of mine took the visual neurons that would normally go to the visual

742
00:42:40.001 --> 00:42:41.380
cortex and he rerouted things.

743
00:42:41.381 --> 00:42:44.830
So they plugged into what we'd normally call the auditory cortex and then that

744
00:42:44.831 --> 00:42:49.300
became the auditory cortex.
Sorry,
it became the visual cortex.
In other words,

745
00:42:49.301 --> 00:42:53.380
if you plug in that data,
and that's what shapes that area.
Um,

746
00:42:53.410 --> 00:42:57.580
what we now know is that this is incredibly fast,

747
00:42:57.581 --> 00:43:01.280
this whole process.
So,
um,
if you,
uh,

748
00:43:01.630 --> 00:43:05.500
blindfold me tightly and stick me in a scanner within 90 minutes,

749
00:43:05.501 --> 00:43:09.220
my visual Cortex is starting to respond to sound and touch and things like that.

750
00:43:09.340 --> 00:43:14.290
So in other words,
the takeover of these areas is extremely fluid.
Um,

751
00:43:14.860 --> 00:43:15.100
<v 8>okay.</v>

752
00:43:15.100 --> 00:43:19.450
<v 0>So that's the answer to the question is there's nothing special about visual</v>

753
00:43:19.451 --> 00:43:19.991
cortex or wherever.

754
00:43:19.991 --> 00:43:22.150
It's just a matter of how much information is coming in and where the

755
00:43:22.151 --> 00:43:25.390
information is coming in.
And if the brain finds it relevant and salient,

756
00:43:25.391 --> 00:43:26.840
then it devotes territory to it.

757
00:43:28.320 --> 00:43:29.640
<v 8>Thanks.
Yeah.</v>

758
00:43:30.310 --> 00:43:31.960
<v 9>Uh,
so a lot of the applications that we saw,</v>

759
00:43:32.020 --> 00:43:36.880
the vest had been for a strictly communicated purposes,
uh,
is there,
uh,

760
00:43:36.970 --> 00:43:40.030
like also say,
uh,
like a possible emotional response.

761
00:43:40.031 --> 00:43:41.830
If you played a song to the best could,

762
00:43:41.860 --> 00:43:45.790
could you learn to perceive something like music through like the more tactile

763
00:43:45.791 --> 00:43:48.550
sensation and kind of get the same kind of response you got hearing it?

764
00:43:49.010 --> 00:43:50.450
<v 0>Yeah,
it's a good question.</v>

765
00:43:50.451 --> 00:43:55.040
So one thing we've discovered quite accidentally is that deaf people really like

766
00:43:55.041 --> 00:43:57.510
listening to music on these things.
Um,

767
00:43:57.930 --> 00:43:58.860
<v 9>all right.
It feels really good.</v>

768
00:43:59.170 --> 00:44:03.580
<v 0>Exactly.
It feels really good.
And it in fact,
one thing we've done is listened to,</v>

769
00:44:03.581 --> 00:44:06.190
for example,
the radio with this on and you know,

770
00:44:06.191 --> 00:44:08.660
it's broken up in all the different frequencies,
the cigarettes,

771
00:44:08.680 --> 00:44:10.930
a high note and you're feeling it.
It's an amazing good.

772
00:44:11.200 --> 00:44:14.500
And when you turn the vest off,
the music feels sort of thin,

773
00:44:14.710 --> 00:44:19.140
like you're missing something now.
Um,
so it is terrific.
Uh,

774
00:44:19.180 --> 00:44:22.720
one thing I'll just point out is that we only have 32 frequency bins on here.

775
00:44:23.140 --> 00:44:25.690
So you're not actually capturing all the possible notes.

776
00:44:25.691 --> 00:44:30.010
You just kept sort of lumping binning of those.
Um,
nonetheless,

777
00:44:30.011 --> 00:44:32.100
what you get out of it is,
you know,

778
00:44:32.130 --> 00:44:35.220
the rhythm and the feeling of where the music's going and the highs and lows and

779
00:44:35.221 --> 00:44:38.640
all that.
So people,
people,
even though I hadn't predicted this just,

780
00:44:38.670 --> 00:44:42.060
they liked that possibly more than anything else they do with the vest.
Yeah.

781
00:44:42.810 --> 00:44:43.643
Thanks.

782
00:44:44.200 --> 00:44:46.270
<v 10>32 is a lead into my question.
How do you,</v>

783
00:44:46.570 --> 00:44:50.700
how do you characterize the richness of what you can input through the vest?
Um,

784
00:44:50.790 --> 00:44:54.450
I mean,
I suppose there's frequency and amplitude and special resolution and,

785
00:44:54.451 --> 00:44:58.150
and um,
and how do,
what are the dimensions and,
and the,

786
00:44:58.360 --> 00:45:02.860
the follow up question then is how does that compare to the potential capability

787
00:45:02.861 --> 00:45:03.694
of the torso?

788
00:45:05.160 --> 00:45:07.410
<v 0>Um,
so let me say three things about that.</v>

789
00:45:07.440 --> 00:45:11.670
One of them is that we've also built a version with 64 motors on it.
Um,

790
00:45:12.240 --> 00:45:16.290
and the only reason we're not using that is just because 32 seems to be totally

791
00:45:16.291 --> 00:45:20.130
sufficient and it's,
you know,
easier and cheaper to build.
But,
um,

792
00:45:20.700 --> 00:45:24.390
so there are several things.
One is the how,
what does the spatial resolution,

793
00:45:24.391 --> 00:45:26.100
how close can we get these motors together?

794
00:45:26.370 --> 00:45:29.190
There's something called two point discrimination which we measure,

795
00:45:29.191 --> 00:45:33.030
which is just at some point if you move signals on the skin too close together,

796
00:45:33.031 --> 00:45:34.290
your brain can't distinguish those.

797
00:45:34.440 --> 00:45:37.530
So we've carefully measured everything on the torso and published on this sort

798
00:45:37.531 --> 00:45:41.880
of thing about how far they need to be.
Anyway.
The point is 64 is easy.
Um,

799
00:45:41.881 --> 00:45:45.720
we could probably fit,
I don't know,
up to 80 or 90 on the torso with no problem.

800
00:45:46.950 --> 00:45:50.220
As far as what the motors represent,
I probably with this audience,

801
00:45:50.221 --> 00:45:52.080
should have been more technical about it.
The,

802
00:45:52.081 --> 00:45:55.650
each motors representing a different part of the frequency band from low to
high.

803
00:45:55.950 --> 00:45:59.970
So in other words,
um,
this is the sound that is captured.

804
00:45:59.971 --> 00:46:04.680
We typically cut it off from like 300 hertz to let's say six to 8,000 hertz at

805
00:46:04.681 --> 00:46:07.350
the upper end because you don't actually need anything higher than that,

806
00:46:07.351 --> 00:46:09.900
even though ears can hear a little higher than that.
Um,

807
00:46:10.230 --> 00:46:15.120
and so then each mode represents some beginning of the frequencies and just

808
00:46:15.121 --> 00:46:16.350
represents the amplitude.

809
00:46:16.351 --> 00:46:21.120
So if this bin has a lot of aptitude than that motor is harder.

810
00:46:21.150 --> 00:46:24.720
Yeah,
I think that was all the questions that yes,
it did.

811
00:46:24.721 --> 00:46:27.780
I miss something that,
I mean,
that's what we have.

812
00:46:27.781 --> 00:46:31.350
I'll just get into one of the thing.
We've got a lot of sophisticated software,

813
00:46:31.351 --> 00:46:33.440
three years' worth of stuff that we've worked on to,

814
00:46:33.490 --> 00:46:37.420
to do all these other tricky things like you know,
noise,
Florence,

815
00:46:37.421 --> 00:46:41.190
and let's say we're talking and some of the air conditioner kicks on him within

816
00:46:41.220 --> 00:46:43.620
like 20 or 30 seconds,
that'll get canceled out.

817
00:46:43.621 --> 00:46:47.070
So I'm not hearing noise in any different frequency band.

818
00:46:47.071 --> 00:46:50.640
And we have an adaptive ceiling and adaptive noise threshold and all kinds of

819
00:46:50.641 --> 00:46:51.580
other tricks we put in.

820
00:46:51.581 --> 00:46:55.530
But essentially think of it like a 48 transform with binning.

821
00:46:56.210 --> 00:46:57.470
<v 10>That answers the question for sound,</v>

822
00:46:57.471 --> 00:47:01.280
but it doesn't really say is this equivalent to what's in ready player one

823
00:47:02.790 --> 00:47:03.870
<v 0>oh with the ready player.</v>

824
00:47:03.871 --> 00:47:08.871
One thing that I'm almost embarrassed about that because that hardly utilizes

825
00:47:09.930 --> 00:47:13.290
all the capabilities we have ready player one,
it's if there's a collision here,

826
00:47:13.291 --> 00:47:14.850
buzz that motor.
So,

827
00:47:14.880 --> 00:47:17.700
so I'm just feeling where everything's going and there's all sorts of illusions

828
00:47:17.880 --> 00:47:22.110
that,
that we implement about,
you know,
even though there's motor here and here,

829
00:47:22.200 --> 00:47:26.430
we can make it seem like any point along,
anywhere in between has been touched.

830
00:47:26.860 --> 00:47:31.540
Um,
I can explain how we do those.
And so on.
But that's simply,

831
00:47:31.780 --> 00:47:34.420
hey,
where was my avatar touched?
That's where I get touched.

832
00:47:34.480 --> 00:47:35.313
So that's the easy part.

833
00:47:36.040 --> 00:47:36.873
<v 8>Yeah.</v>

834
00:47:36.990 --> 00:47:37.823
<v 7>Yes.</v>

835
00:47:37.830 --> 00:47:41.370
Should I be worried that I'm too old and my brain isn't going to be able to like

836
00:47:41.400 --> 00:47:42.980
pick it up as well as a younger person?

837
00:47:43.080 --> 00:47:44.670
<v 0>Great question.
No,
we've been testing,</v>

838
00:47:44.720 --> 00:47:48.700
we've tested it on 432 deaf people as an example.
And uh,

839
00:47:48.880 --> 00:47:52.470
the oldest is probably around 70 or 75 and they can get it pretty easily as
well.

840
00:47:52.610 --> 00:47:54.700
<v 7>Is there like a difference in them how quickly the yeah.</v>

841
00:47:54.740 --> 00:47:59.420
<v 0>Yes,
exactly.
Very good.
So,
so if we plot things from like 16 year olds,</v>

842
00:47:59.421 --> 00:48:04.130
this 75 year olds and we're looking at,
let's just say how fast they pick it up,

843
00:48:04.250 --> 00:48:08.570
it does go down and it's essentially linear.
Uh,
so it just,
it just goes down.

844
00:48:08.571 --> 00:48:12.800
So it just takes a 75 year old longer to learn it.
They still learn it.

845
00:48:12.880 --> 00:48:13.713
It's just harder.

846
00:48:13.850 --> 00:48:15.960
<v 7>And do they get to the same level of math?</v>

847
00:48:16.080 --> 00:48:18.640
<v 0>I think so.
I think so.
Um,</v>

848
00:48:18.690 --> 00:48:22.260
ask me that again in about a month and I'll be able to tell you the data.

849
00:48:22.440 --> 00:48:25.800
But the cool part is on day one,
right when people come in,

850
00:48:26.760 --> 00:48:29.340
when we present sounds to the wristband and they say,
hey,

851
00:48:29.341 --> 00:48:33.390
was that a dog barking or footsteps or a microwave,
Ding or whatever.

852
00:48:33.690 --> 00:48:36.930
People are pretty good at that straight away without ever having worn it before.

853
00:48:36.931 --> 00:48:40.740
It's sort of surprising the intuitive when you're feeling stuff,
by the way,

854
00:48:40.741 --> 00:48:43.770
Andrew,
who's ever around at the end,
you can come and feel what it feels like.

855
00:48:44.160 --> 00:48:46.140
Yeah.
Thanks.
Yes.

856
00:48:46.950 --> 00:48:50.670
<v 7>Have you spent much time focusing yet on security and privacy in these,
uh,</v>

857
00:48:50.880 --> 00:48:51.631
privacy being,

858
00:48:51.631 --> 00:48:55.110
if someone could extract all the sounds that you heard or security being someone

859
00:48:55.111 --> 00:48:57.930
could just make it seem like you're hearing something else?

860
00:48:58.130 --> 00:49:01.850
<v 0>Yeah,
a good question.
The answer is yes.
We've made sure this is really secure.</v>

861
00:49:01.851 --> 00:49:05.930
So the,
um,
as far as,

862
00:49:06.440 --> 00:49:09.900
um,
recording sounds,
there's no recording that goes on.
So,

863
00:49:10.130 --> 00:49:11.360
just as example of the wristband,

864
00:49:11.361 --> 00:49:15.650
the microphones are built into here and it's capturing the data and doing the 40

865
00:49:15.651 --> 00:49:18.110
transforming all the other tricks that we're doing.
And then,

866
00:49:18.111 --> 00:49:21.290
but it's not getting recorded anywhere.
What is actually happening.
And,

867
00:49:21.540 --> 00:49:24.260
and with this thing,
we don't record anything either.
So we're,

868
00:49:24.290 --> 00:49:25.760
we're sure about that.
And then the other,

869
00:49:25.820 --> 00:49:27.920
and then for the passing the information,

870
00:49:27.921 --> 00:49:31.730
we're just making sure that it's all secure.
Yeah.
But,
but we've,

871
00:49:31.731 --> 00:49:34.730
we've thought about that also.
It would be a,
you know,

872
00:49:34.820 --> 00:49:38.180
whatever this is a psi Phi story 50 years from now that somebody puts in

873
00:49:38.181 --> 00:49:40.850
information that,
yeah.
Hey Bob.
And he turned around and there's an there.

874
00:49:41.240 --> 00:49:43.340
So thank you for that question.
Yeah.

875
00:49:43.880 --> 00:49:46.320
<v 11>Ah,
hi.
I have two related questions.
I'm one,</v>

876
00:49:46.321 --> 00:49:50.430
what is the battery life on those things and to,
can I buy one?

877
00:49:50.910 --> 00:49:51.743
<v 0>Great.</v>

878
00:49:52.050 --> 00:49:55.860
The battery life is 16 hours and we want it to make it so it's just like a cell

879
00:49:55.861 --> 00:49:58.080
phone so that you wear this all day long for example,

880
00:49:58.081 --> 00:50:02.460
and then you plug it in at night.
Um,
and the answer is this,

881
00:50:02.461 --> 00:50:06.810
you will be able to buy in December.
And this,
we are,
um,

882
00:50:06.870 --> 00:50:10.040
uh,
about July.
So this is art.

883
00:50:10.080 --> 00:50:12.090
This is available for preorder on the website,

884
00:50:12.091 --> 00:50:15.900
and this'll come out in the seven months,
eight months from now.
Thank you.

885
00:50:16.050 --> 00:50:19.870
Thanks very much.
Any other questions?

886
00:50:20.900 --> 00:50:21.733
<v 8>Yeah.</v>

887
00:50:23.350 --> 00:50:25.990
<v 0>Great.
Thank you very much.
Great.
Thank you guys so much.</v>

888
00:50:27.810 --> 00:50:30.630
<v 11>[inaudible].</v>
