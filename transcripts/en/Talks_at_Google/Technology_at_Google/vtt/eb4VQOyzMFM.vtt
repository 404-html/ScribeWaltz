00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:10.080
Hello everyone.
Happy Environment Week Ami have.
So I liked him,

2
00:00:10.090 --> 00:00:13.290
just introduced me.
I'm the founder and director of innovation at biome.

3
00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:18.060
And today I'd like to talk about how nature can inspire us to revolutionize the

4
00:00:18.061 --> 00:00:21.810
built environment and how we can work towards a banner metic future.

5
00:00:22.860 --> 00:00:26.040
But first I want you all to sit back,
relax,

6
00:00:26.041 --> 00:00:29.880
take a deep breath and I want you to imagine that you're an omnipresent,

7
00:00:29.881 --> 00:00:34.290
being capable of experiencing,
feeling and observing every event,

8
00:00:34.291 --> 00:00:39.291
situation and circumstance that has taken place over the last 60 years and take

9
00:00:39.961 --> 00:00:43.110
it in.
What will your perception be of humanity?

10
00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:48.300
Would you see humans as a transcendent species that has rapidly evolved in the

11
00:00:48.301 --> 00:00:49.710
most extraordinary way,

12
00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:53.280
overcoming barriers to achieve advanced levels of intelligence,

13
00:00:53.281 --> 00:00:55.200
consciousness and civilization?

14
00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:59.670
Or would you see a foolish species willfully ignorant of its impact upon the

15
00:00:59.671 --> 00:01:00.504
world?

16
00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:05.070
Would you see a collection of beautiful and unique organisms with limitless

17
00:01:05.071 --> 00:01:09.510
capacity for compassion and empathy or would you see destructive levels of

18
00:01:09.511 --> 00:01:13.530
arrogance and greed and an animal that has forced its own path and for Golden,

19
00:01:13.531 --> 00:01:18.060
its place in the order of nature forgotten its connection with the earth and its

20
00:01:18.061 --> 00:01:22.020
inhabitants forgotten the whole that we were only supposed to be a very small

21
00:01:22.021 --> 00:01:25.920
part of have we created materials,
processes,

22
00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:29.880
methods of governance and systems that are designed to deplete our planets of

23
00:01:29.881 --> 00:01:34.881
its resources and where we really need another two planets worth of resources in

24
00:01:34.981 --> 00:01:39.360
30 years time to maintain the lives that we have built and learn to love.

25
00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:44.760
Have we really exhausted over half of the earth's precious resources to create

26
00:01:44.761 --> 00:01:49.140
our global built environments which only form around 1% of the earth's surface.

27
00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:50.371
Whilst doing that,

28
00:01:50.371 --> 00:01:55.371
we also contributed to over 50% of all carbon emissions to build 1% of the

29
00:01:55.981 --> 00:01:57.660
earth's surface.
Really,

30
00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:03.060
would you see us as one hand working towards a common goal or just individuals

31
00:02:03.061 --> 00:02:07.500
scattered,
working towards personal gain and wealth?
Would you see greed,

32
00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:11.550
pain and hunger or beauty?
Compassion and love.

33
00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:16.350
Is it too late?
Is this a lost cause or is the hope,

34
00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:22.080
are we capable of cooperating with and learning from nature and how it managed

35
00:02:22.081 --> 00:02:24.180
to build the most sustainable,
circular,

36
00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:28.350
elegant and efficient environments and systems with the primary goals of

37
00:02:28.351 --> 00:02:32.910
regeneration and improved health?
Well,
the answer to that last one is yes,

38
00:02:32.911 --> 00:02:35.580
and there's a term for that and it's biomimetics.

39
00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:39.390
Biomimetics is not the simple invitation of natural form,

40
00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:44.160
but it's rather the abstraction of biological systems and processes in order to

41
00:02:44.161 --> 00:02:46.480
create solutions for the world that we're living in.

42
00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:50.330
The gherkin here is actually a perfect example of bond mimetics.

43
00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:52.590
It may not look like natural forms,

44
00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:57.390
but it's actually gone exoskeleton and has got a ventilation system which is

45
00:02:57.391 --> 00:03:00.930
inspired by coral in the sea.
So it's actually a very intelligent,

46
00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:03.670
efficient building using the genius of nature.

47
00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:08.350
And when we rely more on biology as opposed to technology,

48
00:03:08.351 --> 00:03:09.670
when we're solving a problem,

49
00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:12.880
we're finding that we're using a lot more structure,

50
00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:17.650
a lot more information and data and a lot less resources or substance.

51
00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:22.090
We're finding that we're relying a lot less on energy and we're using all the

52
00:03:22.091 --> 00:03:25.990
data that we're collecting on a daily basis and now with all the advanced

53
00:03:26.020 --> 00:03:29.140
technologies and AI that's around,
we're able to make that happen.

54
00:03:29.141 --> 00:03:33.760
I'm sure you know much more about that than I do and it requires a certain level

55
00:03:33.761 --> 00:03:36.100
of systems thinking and systems thinking.

56
00:03:36.100 --> 00:03:39.130
I'm not sure how many people here are familiar with complexity theory,

57
00:03:39.370 --> 00:03:43.930
but it's the idea that the world around us consists of different systems with

58
00:03:43.931 --> 00:03:47.530
inputs and outputs and when you start to see the world that way,

59
00:03:47.590 --> 00:03:49.870
you start to realize that these interactions,

60
00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:54.340
if you find an output that goes into the same system as an end point or another,

61
00:03:54.790 --> 00:03:59.050
you create what we know now as a circular economy and that's a buzzword that

62
00:03:59.051 --> 00:04:02.020
we're hearing all the time at the moment.
But in its simplest form,

63
00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:07.000
we're moving away from the linear economy where we're extracting natural

64
00:04:07.001 --> 00:04:07.834
resources,

65
00:04:07.930 --> 00:04:12.930
we're making products in materials using carbon intensive energy intensive

66
00:04:13.301 --> 00:04:17.770
processes,
and then we're using our products and disposing of them.

67
00:04:17.800 --> 00:04:21.760
I'm creating ways and adding to the environmental impact and the impact on our

68
00:04:21.761 --> 00:04:25.780
health and wellbeing.
When we moved towards a circular economy,

69
00:04:25.820 --> 00:04:30.040
we're finding that we're starting the process by reusing recycling and ethically

70
00:04:30.041 --> 00:04:34.300
sourcing materials and products and things that are already in circulation

71
00:04:34.301 --> 00:04:35.170
within our economy.

72
00:04:35.560 --> 00:04:40.300
We're making use in much more carbon efficient and energy efficient processes

73
00:04:40.630 --> 00:04:44.270
and we're designing for deconstruction were taken into account the entire life

74
00:04:44.271 --> 00:04:46.390
cycle of a product or a material.

75
00:04:46.570 --> 00:04:49.300
When we're up to sign again and during the use phase,

76
00:04:49.301 --> 00:04:51.670
we're introducing things like servitization.

77
00:04:51.790 --> 00:04:55.570
We're extending the lifespan of a material or a product,

78
00:04:55.870 --> 00:04:59.470
and at that stage we're actually adding as much value as possible.

79
00:04:59.710 --> 00:05:03.130
The circular economy is not simply about recycling resources,

80
00:05:03.400 --> 00:05:07.180
but it's about adding as much value as possible at every stage of the way.

81
00:05:07.330 --> 00:05:10.810
So the results that you're using is not depleting and value with tool.

82
00:05:10.840 --> 00:05:13.780
It's either maintaining the same value or increasing in value.

83
00:05:14.380 --> 00:05:19.270
And that's exactly what we do at biome biome is a research and development led

84
00:05:19.271 --> 00:05:23.980
company that places biological systems at the heart of its inspiration to create

85
00:05:23.981 --> 00:05:26.440
a healthier and more sustainable built environment.

86
00:05:26.980 --> 00:05:30.400
We do this through a range of biobased materials that we've developed.

87
00:05:30.640 --> 00:05:34.750
We've also developed our own construction systems and we also offer a range of

88
00:05:34.751 --> 00:05:38.320
services and research starting with our materials,

89
00:05:38.321 --> 00:05:42.340
our focus first on all organic refuse by a compound.

90
00:05:42.760 --> 00:05:46.270
And it's basically an organic binder that we've developed that can be mixed with

91
00:05:46.271 --> 00:05:51.010
any food or agricultural waste to create materials that can be made into sheets

92
00:05:51.011 --> 00:05:53.770
or can be molded into complex three d forms as well.

93
00:05:54.400 --> 00:05:58.430
And you can achieve all sorts of aesthetics depending on the type of ways that

94
00:05:58.431 --> 00:05:59.264
you're using.

95
00:05:59.600 --> 00:06:04.130
And the properties of the material are also influenced by the range of waste

96
00:06:04.131 --> 00:06:08.360
that we have access to.
So you can see things here like orange pill,

97
00:06:08.361 --> 00:06:12.710
we could use um,
uh,
different waste streams from agriculture as well,

98
00:06:12.711 --> 00:06:16.280
like hemp and,
um,
we can use sugarcane waste as well.

99
00:06:16.730 --> 00:06:20.450
And we're developing that into a plant based concrete which integrates more

100
00:06:20.451 --> 00:06:21.500
agricultural waste.

101
00:06:21.501 --> 00:06:26.090
And we're tweaking our recipe where with our organic binder to allow it to

102
00:06:26.091 --> 00:06:27.510
maintain and um,

103
00:06:27.630 --> 00:06:31.880
be able to withhold a such a really high mechanical loads,
two,

104
00:06:31.881 --> 00:06:33.560
two rifle concrete.

105
00:06:34.760 --> 00:06:36.980
Another material we're working with is mycelium,

106
00:06:37.160 --> 00:06:40.640
which you may have already heard of.
It's getting quite a lot,

107
00:06:40.641 --> 00:06:45.641
a lot of publicity lately and it's basically the vegetative part of a mushroom.

108
00:06:46.730 --> 00:06:49.040
If you look at any forest onto the ground,

109
00:06:49.100 --> 00:06:53.330
there are giant webs of my Celia and that hold the top topsoil's together and

110
00:06:53.331 --> 00:06:56.930
they allow the plants to communicate with one another.
And what we've done,

111
00:06:56.931 --> 00:06:59.960
and this is known process that used in universities and companies around the

112
00:06:59.961 --> 00:07:02.450
world,
is you're taking the mycelium,

113
00:07:02.540 --> 00:07:07.330
you're introducing it to a waste stream or a substrate in a mold and then you're

114
00:07:07.340 --> 00:07:09.320
allowing it to consume that substrate.

115
00:07:09.350 --> 00:07:14.170
And what you end up with is a material just like this one here,
um,

116
00:07:14.300 --> 00:07:17.270
which is actually got incredible insulation qualities.

117
00:07:17.300 --> 00:07:21.380
It's self extinguishing naturally and there aren't any chemicals or additives in

118
00:07:21.381 --> 00:07:22.070
it at all.

119
00:07:22.070 --> 00:07:25.730
And we're developing this into a mushroom based installation or mycelium

120
00:07:25.731 --> 00:07:26.564
installation.

121
00:07:26.810 --> 00:07:30.110
And we're able to rival some of the premium installation that's on the market

122
00:07:30.111 --> 00:07:34.520
were actually outperforming all of them as well as being able to outperform all

123
00:07:34.521 --> 00:07:38.000
of the industries stances that are currently in place are currently testing and

124
00:07:38.001 --> 00:07:39.650
developing the process.
You could see,

125
00:07:39.651 --> 00:07:43.580
so he Locklin the eaten ice cream off on site when there was thousand degrees of

126
00:07:43.581 --> 00:07:48.410
heat on the other.
Um,
and the ice cream didn't melt.
And we're also using it for,

127
00:07:48.470 --> 00:07:51.400
um,
uh,
high end sort of,
uh,

128
00:07:51.440 --> 00:07:54.290
products and consumer products and furniture.

129
00:07:55.340 --> 00:07:58.940
But our mycelium installation is really our star product when it comes to

130
00:07:58.941 --> 00:07:59.774
mycelium.

131
00:07:59.810 --> 00:08:03.530
And that's because of its magical qualities when it comes to installation in

132
00:08:03.540 --> 00:08:07.100
comparison to other,
um,
products that are on the market.

133
00:08:07.310 --> 00:08:10.970
And especially when you think about the health and wellbeing aspects as well as

134
00:08:10.971 --> 00:08:13.790
the carbon footprints and energy benefits that come with it as well.

135
00:08:14.180 --> 00:08:17.840
And over on top of all of that,
we're able to be price competitive as well.

136
00:08:18.860 --> 00:08:21.980
We'll introducing such radical technologies like these,

137
00:08:21.981 --> 00:08:23.330
you need to ensure their survival.

138
00:08:24.080 --> 00:08:26.870
And when you look at how nature ensures a species survival,

139
00:08:26.900 --> 00:08:31.040
it makes sure that appropriate ecosystem exists before and in a species is

140
00:08:31.041 --> 00:08:31.874
introduced.

141
00:08:32.330 --> 00:08:35.360
And we were able to do that through a construction system that we've developed

142
00:08:35.361 --> 00:08:39.070
bespokely for natural materials that may not be,
um,

143
00:08:39.110 --> 00:08:42.760
that may not be able to withhold the types of loads that current synthetic,
uh,

144
00:08:42.840 --> 00:08:45.110
alternatives are able to withstand.

145
00:08:45.590 --> 00:08:49.000
And this system is inspired by the molecular structure of carbon are,

146
00:08:49.100 --> 00:08:52.790
allows buildings to be deconstructed at any stage of their life because there

147
00:08:52.791 --> 00:08:55.010
aren't any permanent binders or fasteners.

148
00:08:55.290 --> 00:08:58.050
It's all basically a giant three d jigsaw puzzle.

149
00:08:58.470 --> 00:09:03.470
And an architect can choose any floor plan and only use our 21 components to

150
00:09:03.901 --> 00:09:04.734
create the building.

151
00:09:05.130 --> 00:09:09.240
So it offers extreme flexibility and modularity at the same time,

152
00:09:09.241 --> 00:09:11.910
which is something that's quite rare within the construction industry at the

153
00:09:11.911 --> 00:09:15.780
moment.
Although mycelium and obi currently available on the market,

154
00:09:15.940 --> 00:09:19.140
trigeminy is still in development and we're looking to launch it and around two

155
00:09:19.141 --> 00:09:22.050
years' time,
again,

156
00:09:22.260 --> 00:09:24.750
with introducing such a radical construction system,

157
00:09:24.751 --> 00:09:28.680
you need to ensure that the appropriate ecosystem exists in place.

158
00:09:29.190 --> 00:09:33.960
And we've done that by developing a circular business model that completely

159
00:09:33.961 --> 00:09:36.690
changes the sourcing process into a revenue stream.

160
00:09:36.720 --> 00:09:38.190
So instead of buying resources,

161
00:09:38.191 --> 00:09:41.430
we're actually getting paid to collect resources or having them donate it to us.

162
00:09:42.030 --> 00:09:43.920
We then turn them into your materials.

163
00:09:44.130 --> 00:09:47.970
Those materials are then sold to industry and contractually bound to be

164
00:09:47.971 --> 00:09:49.440
collected at the end of life.

165
00:09:49.770 --> 00:09:52.680
And we include that in the cost of the material itself.

166
00:09:52.770 --> 00:09:56.580
And we're able to do that because we're hacking the costs of the,
uh,

167
00:09:56.610 --> 00:10:01.530
the actual manufacturing process by getting our resources donated or getting

168
00:10:01.531 --> 00:10:05.790
paid to collect them and then using a living organism as opposed to labor and

169
00:10:05.791 --> 00:10:08.370
machinery to create the actual products.

170
00:10:09.060 --> 00:10:13.530
And then the building is built on site at 5% of current bill times.

171
00:10:13.850 --> 00:10:17.040
We are then monitoring the building throughout its life with partners that we're

172
00:10:17.041 --> 00:10:20.070
working with at the moment.
And then,
um,

173
00:10:20.220 --> 00:10:23.520
any maintenance of reconfiguration that takes place throughout the building's

174
00:10:23.521 --> 00:10:25.860
life is covered with a subscription service.

175
00:10:26.070 --> 00:10:30.390
So we're bringing servitization to property,
which is a real game changer.

176
00:10:30.720 --> 00:10:34.320
And the main reason why the housing crisis in existence is not necessarily

177
00:10:34.321 --> 00:10:37.980
because there aren't enough homes in London,
but it's more because,
um,

178
00:10:38.010 --> 00:10:42.600
there are the housing market is not accessible or inclusive enough for those who

179
00:10:42.601 --> 00:10:44.070
are looking for homes.

180
00:10:44.460 --> 00:10:48.690
And we were able to sell houses for something like 20 to 60,000 pounds and then

181
00:10:48.691 --> 00:10:50.100
offer a subscription service,

182
00:10:50.101 --> 00:10:53.220
which is tiny percentage of that on an annual basis.

183
00:10:53.430 --> 00:10:56.820
And that's seen as an investment because at end of life you sell the uh,

184
00:10:56.821 --> 00:11:00.240
the components back to us or you take them with you wherever you're going.

185
00:11:01.320 --> 00:11:05.460
And it's sort of shakes up the property market and separates the value of land

186
00:11:05.520 --> 00:11:06.211
and buildings,

187
00:11:06.211 --> 00:11:09.390
which is quite an interesting concept that we're also looking to trial before

188
00:11:09.391 --> 00:11:12.900
tracking me is launched with other modular construction systems.

189
00:11:14.460 --> 00:11:14.970
Again,

190
00:11:14.970 --> 00:11:19.290
you need to ensure inappropriate ecosystem exists when introducing and changing

191
00:11:19.291 --> 00:11:20.250
our business models.

192
00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:25.080
And we do that by holding lots of events and talks like this one.
Um,

193
00:11:25.380 --> 00:11:28.470
as well as holding workshops with industry to make sure that we're able to

194
00:11:28.471 --> 00:11:32.400
change perceptions and have the industry ready for what we're about to launch.

195
00:11:32.401 --> 00:11:36.300
Or what we're about to bring to market and it's this sort of systems thinking

196
00:11:36.301 --> 00:11:40.320
where we're constantly zooming out every step of the way and looking at the

197
00:11:40.321 --> 00:11:45.321
bigger picture and making sure that our product or our invention or technology

198
00:11:45.720 --> 00:11:50.430
is fitting in within the current economy in the most efficient and seamless way

199
00:11:50.431 --> 00:11:54.970
possible.
About a year ago,

200
00:11:55.180 --> 00:12:00.010
as Tim has mentioned,
um,
used who's the general deputy,

201
00:12:00.011 --> 00:12:03.060
a deputy general manager at compass,
um,

202
00:12:03.090 --> 00:12:06.340
met with our director of projects Harry and discussed orange pill.

203
00:12:07.090 --> 00:12:11.830
We realized that you guys love to drink your orange trees and there's a lot of

204
00:12:11.831 --> 00:12:13.870
orange peel being generated as a result of that.

205
00:12:14.410 --> 00:12:18.350
And orange peels actually one of the hardest way streams to get rid of because

206
00:12:18.351 --> 00:12:22.780
of its high acidity levels.
We have collected so far,

207
00:12:22.900 --> 00:12:26.140
1.4 tons of the appeal that you have used,

208
00:12:26.350 --> 00:12:30.400
which is 24,000 oranges.
And that's just to create some,
uh,

209
00:12:31.120 --> 00:12:35.140
during the research and development process to create some products like this

210
00:12:35.141 --> 00:12:39.310
one here,
which has a riser,
which hopefully you'll see in your buffet soon.

211
00:12:39.760 --> 00:12:41.770
And you can see Tim is very happy with it there.

212
00:12:44.590 --> 00:12:48.640
Um,
and hopefully within the next few months or at the very latest,

213
00:12:48.641 --> 00:12:53.420
by the end of the year,
we would have collected over 25 tons of Po from,
uh,

214
00:12:53.440 --> 00:12:56.410
your cafe here at La Plas.
And,
um,

215
00:12:56.610 --> 00:13:00.160
which equates to about 450,000 oranges.
Um,

216
00:13:00.670 --> 00:13:04.570
and that's just the beginning because right now we're able to achieve two to

217
00:13:04.571 --> 00:13:09.070
help you be more circular and achieve circularity would our material orb and the

218
00:13:09.071 --> 00:13:12.520
orange peel,
but there's almost no limit to the type of waste,

219
00:13:12.521 --> 00:13:15.490
whether it's food waste or agricultural waste that we can use an orb.

220
00:13:15.790 --> 00:13:17.260
And when it comes to my Caelian,

221
00:13:17.500 --> 00:13:21.880
we're also developing new strains of mycelium that we're training to consume

222
00:13:21.881 --> 00:13:25.210
synthetic wastes like plastics and textiles as well.

223
00:13:25.690 --> 00:13:29.980
And that just brings in a whole new,
uh,
game changer to the industry.

224
00:13:29.981 --> 00:13:34.210
We're introduces by recycling in a way that eliminates the toxins that exists in

225
00:13:34.211 --> 00:13:35.380
our society.

226
00:13:35.530 --> 00:13:39.130
One of the biggest conundrums of a circular economy is what are we going to do

227
00:13:39.131 --> 00:13:42.400
with all this plastic that's circulating within our economy,

228
00:13:42.401 --> 00:13:45.770
which is having huge impacts on our health and wellbeing and the environment to

229
00:13:45.780 --> 00:13:48.730
every step of the way.
And this may just be the solution,

230
00:13:48.760 --> 00:13:53.020
feed it to mushrooms because they can clean it up and get it out of the system.

231
00:13:54.100 --> 00:13:55.360
We've achieved,
we've,

232
00:13:55.750 --> 00:14:00.480
we've received a lot of recognition and awards along the way,
um,

233
00:14:00.550 --> 00:14:02.800
from national bodies as well as international bodies.

234
00:14:03.040 --> 00:14:06.100
And we're working with some of the largest names in the industry and that's

235
00:14:06.101 --> 00:14:09.170
because we've got a really strong philosophy that really,
um,

236
00:14:09.580 --> 00:14:11.770
connects with large corporations,

237
00:14:11.771 --> 00:14:16.771
targets as well as a local and government and global government targets around

238
00:14:17.171 --> 00:14:18.004
the world.

239
00:14:18.160 --> 00:14:21.580
And we're currently going through a rapid scale up and we're going to be

240
00:14:21.581 --> 00:14:24.850
launching an equity crowdfunding campaign within the next few months.

241
00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:26.380
So if you're interested in that,

242
00:14:26.381 --> 00:14:31.060
please do register your interest on our website because all we really want to do

243
00:14:31.061 --> 00:14:33.370
is work towards a biomimetic future,

244
00:14:33.400 --> 00:14:37.300
a biometric future that will not only benefit us or the people that we're

245
00:14:37.301 --> 00:14:40.780
working with,
but will benefit everyone that lives in this planet,

246
00:14:41.050 --> 00:14:42.970
humans or other,
um,

247
00:14:43.090 --> 00:14:46.870
in a way that allows us to look at things in systems and make sure that there

248
00:14:46.871 --> 00:14:47.650
are,
uh,

249
00:14:47.650 --> 00:14:51.380
there's a circular economy and a future that is inspired by nature in place.

250
00:14:51.680 --> 00:14:55.190
Cause that is the best way to help us reduce our time and costs.

251
00:14:55.580 --> 00:14:56.590
It helps us reduce,

252
00:14:56.900 --> 00:15:01.760
improve or resorts in energy efficiency and it has a dramatic positive impact on

253
00:15:01.761 --> 00:15:06.320
our environmental impact.
I think we don't really need to talk much about this.

254
00:15:06.321 --> 00:15:09.740
It's all over then to use that we're going through a climate crisis so there

255
00:15:09.741 --> 00:15:14.480
really isn't a better time to take action with this.
Most importantly,

256
00:15:14.720 --> 00:15:18.050
we're doing this to improve the impact that we're having on our health and

257
00:15:18.051 --> 00:15:22.310
wellbeing because we don't see buildings as just a place that offers shelter

258
00:15:22.311 --> 00:15:23.210
from the elements,

259
00:15:23.630 --> 00:15:27.260
but rather they're a place that is conducive to our psychological and

260
00:15:27.261 --> 00:15:32.261
physiological wellbeing and hopefully that will secure humanity's future as a

261
00:15:32.361 --> 00:15:35.450
species that has achieved advanced levels of intelligence,

262
00:15:35.451 --> 00:15:38.630
consciousness and civilization.
Thank you very much.

263
00:15:41.050 --> 00:15:41.883
<v 1>Okay,</v>

264
00:15:44.340 --> 00:15:48.000
<v 2>thanks.
Thanks for,
Yep.
Okay.
That was really great and inspiring talk.</v>

265
00:15:48.001 --> 00:15:51.150
We'd just like to open it up to the floor now if anyone's got any questions.

266
00:15:52.140 --> 00:15:53.460
We've got a few Mike's floating around.

267
00:15:53.461 --> 00:15:58.020
If anyone wants to ask a question to a hub or myself,
Yup.

268
00:15:58.230 --> 00:15:59.063
Go for it.

269
00:16:02.310 --> 00:16:02.890
<v 1>Uh,</v>

270
00:16:02.890 --> 00:16:05.050
<v 2>really inspiring stuff while he doing there.</v>

271
00:16:05.530 --> 00:16:09.620
So I'm kind of wondering why doesn't everyone do this like this?

272
00:16:09.830 --> 00:16:14.680
This seems to be like a very sensible thing to do.
So I'm,

273
00:16:14.681 --> 00:16:18.170
I'm kind of surprised that this is maybe not more common.
Okay.

274
00:16:18.270 --> 00:16:22.590
<v 0>It's really difficult to implement such radical technologies without a really</v>

275
00:16:22.591 --> 00:16:25.950
strong network within the industry.
With government,
with academia,

276
00:16:26.250 --> 00:16:30.060
we're only able to do this through the relationships and collaborations that we

277
00:16:30.061 --> 00:16:32.610
have built.
So we're not doing all of this by ourselves,

278
00:16:32.760 --> 00:16:36.810
but we work with really large corporations with governments and not just in the

279
00:16:36.811 --> 00:16:41.240
UK but outside the UK as well.
And uh,
six universities I collaborate,

280
00:16:41.241 --> 00:16:44.320
six of the top universities in Europe are cooperating with us on,
on,

281
00:16:44.380 --> 00:16:45.600
on all of these advances.

282
00:16:45.810 --> 00:16:50.430
So it all boils down to making the right connections and collaborations happen

283
00:16:50.530 --> 00:16:52.170
to make this possible.

284
00:16:52.830 --> 00:16:56.550
If you look at the certain technologies on the road and they're not necessarily

285
00:16:56.551 --> 00:16:58.830
commercially viable as a standalone product,

286
00:16:59.040 --> 00:17:01.050
but when you put it into this business model,

287
00:17:01.051 --> 00:17:02.910
when you put it in within the whole system,

288
00:17:03.030 --> 00:17:04.680
that's when it becomes really commercially viable.

289
00:17:04.710 --> 00:17:07.320
So it's just connecting the dots.
It's really not rocket science.

290
00:17:10.720 --> 00:17:11.750
<v 1>What else?</v>

291
00:17:16.410 --> 00:17:17.310
<v 2>I have a question.</v>

292
00:17:17.400 --> 00:17:22.230
Are you working just on the UK market or you star ready like um,

293
00:17:22.320 --> 00:17:27.240
Arbroath plinth?
Cause as far as I know,
like for them of Scandinavia in there,

294
00:17:27.241 --> 00:17:29.190
like most of the building,
some mates mood.

295
00:17:29.510 --> 00:17:34.220
So England I'm not sure about it cause it's more like,
yeah.
And uh,

296
00:17:34.380 --> 00:17:38.210
sorry.
And the second question,
so does your material,
um,

297
00:17:38.760 --> 00:17:43.760
meet all the requirements like moisture resistance or like a strength,

298
00:17:44.291 --> 00:17:48.360
another thing to build,
for example,
walls or roofing?
It's a good enough,

299
00:17:49.050 --> 00:17:50.160
yeah.
So

300
00:17:50.160 --> 00:17:52.290
<v 0>for your first question,
um,</v>

301
00:17:52.350 --> 00:17:55.650
right now we're focusing on the UK market simply because it's where we're

302
00:17:55.651 --> 00:17:57.990
starting and we have to take things one step at a time.

303
00:17:58.290 --> 00:18:01.500
But we're completely open to explore opportunities around the world.

304
00:18:01.770 --> 00:18:04.980
We've got a very global team from all sorts of backgrounds and disciplines and

305
00:18:04.981 --> 00:18:08.280
from all over the world.
And that's always been our aim.
Um,

306
00:18:08.310 --> 00:18:13.080
we've got a lot of interest in France and in Portugal and in Germany and you'll

307
00:18:13.081 --> 00:18:17.630
find a lot of European countries maybe a lot more advanced than the UK was

308
00:18:17.640 --> 00:18:21.000
particularly in the construction industry when it comes to using natural

309
00:18:21.001 --> 00:18:24.630
materials and the perception is slightly different.
So I completely,
yeah,

310
00:18:24.690 --> 00:18:25.860
I completely agree with that.

311
00:18:25.861 --> 00:18:28.860
And it's something to be more than happy to explore.
Um,

312
00:18:28.890 --> 00:18:32.370
with regards to our materials properties right now or buzz only really suitable

313
00:18:32.371 --> 00:18:33.690
for interior architecture.

314
00:18:33.691 --> 00:18:38.580
So dry lining furniture products that won't be exposed to the elements,

315
00:18:38.790 --> 00:18:43.380
but we're very quickly developing into becoming completely water resistant and

316
00:18:43.560 --> 00:18:47.060
be able to be used externally.
Uh,
one of the things that,
um,

317
00:18:47.250 --> 00:18:50.280
architects absolutely love about Oerb is it's,
uh,

318
00:18:50.400 --> 00:18:54.780
it's aesthetics and so we've got a lot of demands for using it as facades.

319
00:18:54.840 --> 00:18:57.600
And that's something that we're working very hard to make possible.

320
00:19:00.090 --> 00:19:04.860
Yes.
Yeah,
absolutely.
I mean,
it's,
yeah.

321
00:19:11.170 --> 00:19:12.003
<v 2>Um,</v>

322
00:19:13.190 --> 00:19:17.190
so I was working in Poland for seven years in the building material business and

323
00:19:17.191 --> 00:19:18.300
one of the things like the cuties,

324
00:19:18.460 --> 00:19:23.190
that's why I'm interested in the basically and uh,
yeah,

325
00:19:23.220 --> 00:19:24.190
it's like we,
we,

326
00:19:24.191 --> 00:19:28.470
we felt a lot of like mood to Scandinavian mostly as I told you.

327
00:19:28.920 --> 00:19:32.430
And I reckon these guys,
we'd be very interested because it's like,

328
00:19:32.760 --> 00:19:37.320
like all this country's environment isn't the first place.
Yes.

329
00:19:37.590 --> 00:19:42.570
And yeah,
if much release resistant and his strong,
we're going to make millions.

330
00:19:44.690 --> 00:19:49.490
<v 0>Well,
you can look at it right now as a,
as a comparative properties to MDF.</v>

331
00:19:49.670 --> 00:19:53.870
Um,
so you can use it in those similar,
um,
in the same applications,

332
00:19:54.140 --> 00:19:58.040
but we are looking at working very hard to develop it for exterior applications

333
00:19:58.041 --> 00:19:59.210
as well.
Yeah,
yeah.

334
00:20:02.730 --> 00:20:05.940
<v 2>I think it might be nice.
It's such on,
almost mentioned there,</v>

335
00:20:05.941 --> 00:20:09.630
but like the goal of the product is to try and make it more affordable than

336
00:20:09.631 --> 00:20:11.160
what's on the market at the moment.
Absolutely.

337
00:20:11.190 --> 00:20:15.000
<v 0>Absolutely.
So because of the business model that we've built,
um,</v>

338
00:20:15.030 --> 00:20:18.810
we're not only able to compete on social and environmental benefits,

339
00:20:19.080 --> 00:20:23.210
but most importantly,
it's either a comparable to something like MDF,

340
00:20:23.220 --> 00:20:27.120
which is seen as a really affordable material in the industry or it's just

341
00:20:27.121 --> 00:20:28.920
slightly more expensive or cheaper.

342
00:20:29.070 --> 00:20:33.710
And that's our aim is that we don't create a premium sustainable material.
Um,

343
00:20:33.840 --> 00:20:36.720
and I think that's also what makes it quite an attractive material.

344
00:20:36.721 --> 00:20:39.720
We're not trying to do this just to,

345
00:20:39.840 --> 00:20:42.330
for personal gain or for pencil personal wealth,

346
00:20:42.331 --> 00:20:46.590
but to offer something and create a case study and example of how sustainability

347
00:20:46.630 --> 00:20:51.610
could be in a holistic way.
Oh,
it's fascinating.

348
00:20:51.611 --> 00:20:53.370
I think they're doing such an amazing job.
Um,

349
00:20:53.440 --> 00:20:56.620
I was wondering obviously as in when properties become a,

350
00:20:56.621 --> 00:20:58.540
that the material become relevant to be external,

351
00:20:58.541 --> 00:21:01.750
how scalable is it given that it's like a natural process to create this?

352
00:21:02.050 --> 00:21:06.120
Could you create like towns and houses in really short periods if that is the

353
00:21:06.130 --> 00:21:06.963
plan?
Yes.

354
00:21:07.900 --> 00:21:12.850
So we were currently going through a scale up a process and we're looking with

355
00:21:12.851 --> 00:21:17.740
our next facility to pre able to provide 20 homes worth of insulation every

356
00:21:17.740 --> 00:21:18.070
month.

357
00:21:18.070 --> 00:21:22.450
And that's only guided by the size of the facility that's from a 300 to 500

358
00:21:22.451 --> 00:21:24.550
square meter facility.
Um,

359
00:21:24.600 --> 00:21:28.570
and we're also able to build upwards and grow upwards so it's not necessarily

360
00:21:28.571 --> 00:21:31.010
dependent on land use.
Um,

361
00:21:31.011 --> 00:21:34.930
and so we're making sure that there aren't any a biodiversity impacts as well

362
00:21:34.931 --> 00:21:39.460
from the scale up process.
Um,
and so the,

363
00:21:39.490 --> 00:21:40.540
in terms of scalability,

364
00:21:40.541 --> 00:21:43.790
because of the processes that we're using are very similar to Corrine,

365
00:21:43.890 --> 00:21:47.050
a industry standard processes,
particularly with the old material.

366
00:21:47.710 --> 00:21:52.710
It's basically just replacing a binder with an organic one and replacing the

367
00:21:53.411 --> 00:21:54.910
substrate with natural substrate.

368
00:21:55.210 --> 00:21:58.960
So it's a like for like replacement in terms of the manufacturing process more

369
00:21:58.961 --> 00:22:02.440
or less.
How does that compare with the mushroom one?
Cause that seems like,

370
00:22:03.970 --> 00:22:08.230
so with the 20 houses worth of insulation,
that's what the Mycelia material.

371
00:22:08.470 --> 00:22:09.010
Um,

372
00:22:09.010 --> 00:22:14.010
and it could take from four days to six weeks to grow a panel of any size and

373
00:22:14.050 --> 00:22:17.980
have any volume because you can grow them all using the exact same growth cycle.

374
00:22:18.280 --> 00:22:22.600
Um,
so within construction those timeframes are actually quite quick.

375
00:22:22.660 --> 00:22:26.080
So it's a,
it fits quite well in terms of meeting that demand.

376
00:22:26.720 --> 00:22:27.553
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

377
00:22:28.570 --> 00:22:29.920
<v 0>Cool.
Any more questions?</v>

378
00:22:31.420 --> 00:22:33.570
<v 1>Yup.
Cool.</v>

379
00:22:38.120 --> 00:22:39.590
<v 2>I was kind of wondering,
uh,</v>

380
00:22:39.920 --> 00:22:44.920
how do you see the chances if this takes on to like fix the waste stream issue?

381
00:22:45.261 --> 00:22:49.310
Because like what now the incentives to properly separate your waist,

382
00:22:49.311 --> 00:22:53.500
like for a company or also domestic beer on very strong.
Um,

383
00:22:53.780 --> 00:22:58.250
so if,
if waste suddenly becomes more valuable because you can reuse it.

384
00:22:58.251 --> 00:23:03.110
Like what,
what do you think,
what influences that going to happen?

385
00:23:03.280 --> 00:23:07.030
<v 0>Yeah,
so,
um,
regarding the waste streams,</v>

386
00:23:07.031 --> 00:23:09.920
there's absolutely no shortage of waste streams.
Um,

387
00:23:10.090 --> 00:23:13.090
right now the amounts that we collect and during this Caleb,

388
00:23:13.330 --> 00:23:17.200
they're still completely minuscule compared to the actual waste being generated

389
00:23:17.800 --> 00:23:22.170
with regards to the value of ways being increased,
increased and the um,

390
00:23:22.570 --> 00:23:25.870
the organizations realizing that there's a value in this resource.
Um,

391
00:23:25.900 --> 00:23:30.280
we've worked on future projected business models that will help a question that

392
00:23:30.370 --> 00:23:34.450
and also at that point hopefully we would have scaled enough to achieve the

393
00:23:34.451 --> 00:23:37.270
right economies of scale to be able to,
to cope with that.

394
00:23:37.570 --> 00:23:40.960
And other thing as well is very much like we're the way we are working with you

395
00:23:40.961 --> 00:23:41.794
at the moment.

396
00:23:41.950 --> 00:23:46.950
We don't only offer a waste collection service or a product to sell,

397
00:23:47.270 --> 00:23:51.560
we'd like to work as a complete partnership or a long term relationship where

398
00:23:51.561 --> 00:23:54.410
we're working with you to collect the waste from Italian to product,

399
00:23:54.411 --> 00:23:58.850
sell it back to you and have an ongoing circular,
um,
loop happening.

400
00:23:59.120 --> 00:24:03.410
So it's creating those relationships,
um,
alleviates the,

401
00:24:03.710 --> 00:24:06.890
the risk of one of those partners taking advantage of the other.

402
00:24:14.060 --> 00:24:18.000
Is any of this material going to be used in kg x?
One

403
00:24:20.870 --> 00:24:24.630
good question.
It's certainly a journey we're on at the moment.

404
00:24:25.630 --> 00:24:26.463
We've really,

405
00:24:26.510 --> 00:24:31.510
I'm really keen to give as much orange pill as you can take from it and open as

406
00:24:31.611 --> 00:24:36.350
many doors as we can together,
um,
to work forward towards that goal.
But I think,

407
00:24:37.250 --> 00:24:40.170
yeah,
getting it scaled up to that higher level,
it would be fantastic to see.

408
00:24:40.180 --> 00:24:40.610
Yeah,

409
00:24:40.610 --> 00:24:45.230
that's always been the aim for us as t and tackle the construction and building

410
00:24:45.231 --> 00:24:48.290
side of things more than anything because that's where he can have the largest

411
00:24:48.380 --> 00:24:51.350
impact.
So yeah,
there's been some initial discussions.

412
00:24:53.630 --> 00:24:57.940
Cool.
I think that's it.
Unless anyone has any more.
No.
Well,

413
00:24:57.980 --> 00:24:59.100
please join me in thanking.

414
00:24:59.101 --> 00:25:03.200
He had for his time and his team can come [inaudible].
