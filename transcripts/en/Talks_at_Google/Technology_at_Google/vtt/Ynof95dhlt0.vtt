WEBVTT

1
00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:08.810
Yeah,
go ahead.
I need that energy

2
00:00:10.540 --> 00:00:14.160
<v 0>coast.
I'm from New York and I'm like this,
that your collapse.
Help wake me up.
Uh,</v>

3
00:00:14.290 --> 00:00:18.340
so this is my talk,
the Golden Hour.
This talk could save the Internet.
I know,

4
00:00:18.341 --> 00:00:21.010
I was looking for a low bar there.
Um,

5
00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:25.480
the secret role you play in the digital safety and health of the entire
Internet.

6
00:00:25.840 --> 00:00:28.950
And when I was talking to Kat,
Kat said,
you know,
it's like,
you know,

7
00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:32.380
cybersecurity awareness month in like,
there's a lot of stuff going on here.

8
00:00:32.710 --> 00:00:36.160
And I was trying to come up with what's a talk that can reach a lot of different

9
00:00:36.161 --> 00:00:41.161
people regardless of whether they're like super double o seven Jane Bond,

10
00:00:41.501 --> 00:00:44.380
James Bond or whether they're like marketing and stuff.

11
00:00:44.381 --> 00:00:48.760
So this is my attempt and this talk,
uh,
goes out to my fam.

12
00:00:48.761 --> 00:00:52.410
Thanks you so much.
Okay.
All right.
So,
um,

13
00:00:52.450 --> 00:00:55.390
these slides I'll give to cat so other people can have,

14
00:00:55.560 --> 00:00:58.630
it's like a pretty chill license and you can like share them with your friends.

15
00:01:00.970 --> 00:01:02.020
All right.
So,
um,

16
00:01:02.590 --> 00:01:06.430
I used to work for this group called dgs.

17
00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:09.760
And ggs security is a hostile environment,

18
00:01:09.761 --> 00:01:13.150
training and support group and there are risk mitigation company.

19
00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:17.860
And if you are a journalist and you're about to cover a war zone or a hurricane,

20
00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:18.490
uh,

21
00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:22.240
if you are an NGO worker and you're going to help a village of people in a place

22
00:01:22.241 --> 00:01:26.920
where it politically unstable,
you need to know how to get back home.
Okay?

23
00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:31.540
You need to know how to protect the person to your left or right because there's

24
00:01:31.541 --> 00:01:35.080
not always an ambulance or a cab or a hospital even to go to.

25
00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:37.210
And that's what ggs specializes in.

26
00:01:37.510 --> 00:01:40.800
And they do something called risk induced to learning.
Uh,
sorry.
Uh,

27
00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:44.710
so what they do is they kind of like create a simulation of a threat.

28
00:01:44.860 --> 00:01:49.860
So you will know whether you are someone who locks up or laughs or runs.

29
00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:51.610
All those things are not good,

30
00:01:51.730 --> 00:01:55.270
but they need to reach you where you are and teach you how to balance that out

31
00:01:55.420 --> 00:01:58.480
and get to safety.
And a,
that's my hand there.

32
00:01:58.481 --> 00:02:00.310
When it was covered in fake blood Hollywood blood,

33
00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:03.610
they had someone with like a blood pack and like it was like meant to pump like

34
00:02:03.611 --> 00:02:07.660
a heart and it was warm and I was learning how to suture and take care of an

35
00:02:07.661 --> 00:02:11.720
artery and it was very stressful,
but it was designed to be sell.
Right.
Um,

36
00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:15.550
what was I doing for Gjs is I would do like a digital thread.

37
00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:18.910
So it's one thing to say you should use signal or a,
you know,

38
00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:21.460
it's important that you cover your laptop camera,

39
00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:26.300
but it's another thing to see a laptop that is compromised and you can see the

40
00:02:26.301 --> 00:02:27.460
what's going on through the camera.

41
00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:31.030
It's another thing to actually like see what it's like when your text messages

42
00:02:31.031 --> 00:02:32.050
or strung up on a screen.

43
00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:36.280
So we would get a confirmation and permission from people and then create that

44
00:02:36.281 --> 00:02:39.490
lab environment and they can simulate that and then walk backwards.

45
00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:41.500
And now let me tell you,
everyone is like,
that's it.

46
00:02:41.501 --> 00:02:45.220
I'm using signal or whatever secure thing is after that.
Right?
So,
uh,

47
00:02:45.221 --> 00:02:50.190
what does this have to do with my talk?
I'm it forward.
Um,

48
00:02:50.230 --> 00:02:52.120
the golden hour and a,

49
00:02:52.121 --> 00:02:56.400
there's this thing that this guy doctor are Adam's Crowley.
And uh,

50
00:02:56.500 --> 00:02:59.710
his first name really is the letter R,
which is awesome.

51
00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:02.950
And he says there's a golden hour between life and death.

52
00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:06.310
If you're critically injured,
you have less than 60 minutes to survive.

53
00:03:06.610 --> 00:03:11.020
You might not die right then in may be three days or two weeks later.

54
00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:15.520
But something has happened in your body that is air repairable,
right?

55
00:03:15.730 --> 00:03:20.730
And the idea is that there's a golden hour this moment of time and what people

56
00:03:21.011 --> 00:03:22.030
do,
right,

57
00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:26.710
whether they tilting your head or lifting your legs or puts a blanket on you or

58
00:03:26.711 --> 00:03:31.060
whatever in those first 60 minutes has to do with what your life will be like

59
00:03:31.061 --> 00:03:31.894
afterwards,

60
00:03:31.990 --> 00:03:35.590
whether you'll have a full recovery and this will be a scary memory or maybe

61
00:03:35.591 --> 00:03:40.440
you'll have permanent damage or you're no longer with us.
Cool.

62
00:03:40.890 --> 00:03:44.870
So let's talk about our,
so our Adams Crowley is the father,

63
00:03:44.910 --> 00:03:47.960
they say of American Trauma Care Systems and uh,

64
00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:51.270
organized trauma care that saves lives.
Before this,

65
00:03:51.271 --> 00:03:54.270
there was this idea that if you go to a hospital that's close,

66
00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:57.630
you have a pretty good chance it's filled with doctors and nurses and it's

67
00:03:57.631 --> 00:03:59.880
filled with drugs and medicine,
you'll be okay.

68
00:04:00.210 --> 00:04:03.000
But he is someone who had experience with shock and trauma.

69
00:04:03.210 --> 00:04:06.900
And even in the 50s when he was in the army realized that that's not how it

70
00:04:06.901 --> 00:04:10.980
worked.
He had a lab at first we just four beds and they called it the death lab.

71
00:04:11.130 --> 00:04:14.100
And they would,
people would just bring him,
the doctors just bring him patients.

72
00:04:14.430 --> 00:04:16.110
And they were like,
there's no hope for this patient.

73
00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:19.350
And through trial and error and through real scientific method,

74
00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:24.300
he found a way to kind of rural outlook as much as possible and bring those

75
00:04:24.301 --> 00:04:28.800
patients to a place where they can be stabilized.
Really amazing individual,

76
00:04:28.801 --> 00:04:32.610
by the way.
Right?
And in Maryland is where the first shock trauma center is,

77
00:04:32.700 --> 00:04:35.900
and the same day after him.
Okay,

78
00:04:36.170 --> 00:04:39.350
so here's the idea of what the golden hour looks like.

79
00:04:39.530 --> 00:04:44.150
You have the things that kill you the first,
right?
Hypothermia,
blood loss,

80
00:04:44.151 --> 00:04:47.420
your heart stopping.
Those are major things,
right?
And,
uh,

81
00:04:47.600 --> 00:04:50.630
there's her amount of time and there's a chart and it's important that you learn

82
00:04:50.631 --> 00:04:54.860
it.
And if you work in an EMS like an ambulance and you learn a,
B,
c,
d,

83
00:04:54.861 --> 00:04:58.750
and each letter is something you should do.
And if you were trauma care,
like the,

84
00:04:58.751 --> 00:05:02.040
the work that I did with gcs and you learned something called March because,
uh,

85
00:05:02.060 --> 00:05:06.300
some things don't apply when you're the middle of nowhere.
Okay.

86
00:05:06.720 --> 00:05:10.260
The concept of the golden hour is things like treat the greatest threat to life

87
00:05:10.261 --> 00:05:14.790
first treat despite lack of definitive diagnosis,

88
00:05:15.180 --> 00:05:18.210
treat despite complete history,
like a medical history.

89
00:05:18.600 --> 00:05:22.170
And the thing there was just treat,
treat,
treat it like your first on the scene.

90
00:05:22.320 --> 00:05:24.450
You jump in,
do something.

91
00:05:25.610 --> 00:05:26.360
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

92
00:05:26.360 --> 00:05:31.100
<v 0>So,
uh,
there's this other concept which is kind of making you go like,
wait,</v>

93
00:05:31.101 --> 00:05:32.900
I'm in the wrong room.
No,
you're in the right room.
Okay.

94
00:05:33.170 --> 00:05:35.700
So that's called Internet health.
And,
um,

95
00:05:35.720 --> 00:05:38.600
I had a fellowship for 10 months with this group call Mozilla.

96
00:05:38.960 --> 00:05:41.180
They make a browser,
but I can't remember the name.
I said,

97
00:05:41.480 --> 00:05:44.960
that's where the chrome people.
Okay.
And,
um,
and,
uh,

98
00:05:44.990 --> 00:05:48.950
they have a report every year,
which is like,
what is the Internet health like?

99
00:05:49.130 --> 00:05:52.010
And they have different parts in or when they try to talk about what if we were

100
00:05:52.011 --> 00:05:55.130
able to walk around,
like we had a hospital chart and we were like,
okay,

101
00:05:55.131 --> 00:05:56.390
the Internet's legs are like this,

102
00:05:56.391 --> 00:05:59.120
the Internet's heartbreak is like that and we can measure the health of the

103
00:05:59.121 --> 00:06:03.230
Internet.
So how has the Internet doing?

104
00:06:03.231 --> 00:06:06.920
You're probably asking,
well,
I'm sorry,
my friends,

105
00:06:06.980 --> 00:06:11.180
those here in attendance and those watching from their air condition,
uh,

106
00:06:11.270 --> 00:06:15.110
you know,
awesome offices and homes,
uh,
not doing so well.

107
00:06:15.950 --> 00:06:20.090
I'm going to walk through what I call the trauma and shock of the Internet.

108
00:06:20.390 --> 00:06:23.690
So let's,
uh,
this is kind of like a digital trigger warning.

109
00:06:25.370 --> 00:06:29.840
Uh,
we have an online retailer that built an AI recruiter,

110
00:06:29.841 --> 00:06:31.820
which seems like a really good idea.

111
00:06:32.120 --> 00:06:36.590
Something to help you go through the insane number of awesome candidates if you

112
00:06:36.591 --> 00:06:39.680
have an opening or open rec for a position in a company.

113
00:06:39.950 --> 00:06:43.900
And it's especially those entry level once you're just does a day Lucia of

114
00:06:43.910 --> 00:06:47.300
resumes and amazing people applying.
How could one person do this?

115
00:06:47.420 --> 00:06:50.000
Let's get a robot to do it.
But in this case,

116
00:06:50.060 --> 00:06:54.050
the robot turned evil and was throwing out resumes that mentioned the word

117
00:06:54.051 --> 00:06:58.880
women's,
which basically any woman's resume,
not good Internet,
right?

118
00:07:00.400 --> 00:07:01.180
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

119
00:07:01.180 --> 00:07:06.180
<v 0>We had that same online retailer that was working on a really cool way to do</v>

120
00:07:07.151 --> 00:07:11.230
like facial recognition and using that in images and apps and all kinds of
stuff.

121
00:07:11.620 --> 00:07:14.560
But the first candidates in the first clients,
we're testing it,

122
00:07:14.710 --> 00:07:18.130
we're law enforcement agencies,
uh,
who at first said,

123
00:07:18.131 --> 00:07:20.260
we're not doing this anymore.
We're going to stop.

124
00:07:20.380 --> 00:07:23.290
And then as of a couple of days ago,
it was like,
we're in phase two,

125
00:07:23.291 --> 00:07:24.340
we're back red.

126
00:07:24.580 --> 00:07:28.420
That is not a good thing because I don't know about you,

127
00:07:28.600 --> 00:07:32.410
but when I chose to just hang out in a dark basement with my computer instead of

128
00:07:32.411 --> 00:07:35.860
playing with all the other boys and girls and gender nonconforming folks,
right.

129
00:07:36.010 --> 00:07:39.370
Uh,
I wasn't envisioning working on death machines.

130
00:07:39.460 --> 00:07:42.670
I wasn't envisioning on hurting people.
I was just thinking of like,

131
00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:45.670
you know how to get a light saber and everybody's hands.

132
00:07:47.130 --> 00:07:47.963
<v 2>Okay.</v>

133
00:07:47.980 --> 00:07:51.730
<v 0>Speaking about lightsabers,
we have this cool sounding thing called Gemini,</v>

134
00:07:51.880 --> 00:07:53.680
but there's nothing cool about it at all.

135
00:07:53.920 --> 00:07:58.920
Where that same online retailer is probably now one of the only people trying to

136
00:08:00.011 --> 00:08:03.970
get a $10 million bid from the Department of Defense,

137
00:08:04.060 --> 00:08:06.520
a bid that they say is a program,

138
00:08:06.720 --> 00:08:09.790
a truly about increasing the lethality of our department.

139
00:08:10.630 --> 00:08:13.060
I know you thought your department was rough,
right?
Uh,

140
00:08:13.120 --> 00:08:18.070
and providing the best resources to our men and women in uniform where death is

141
00:08:18.100 --> 00:08:21.040
the key performance indicator or the KPI.

142
00:08:21.160 --> 00:08:21.993
<v 2>All right?</v>

143
00:08:24.080 --> 00:08:29.080
<v 0>We have a maker of friendly productivity software that is somehow embroiled in</v>

144
00:08:29.661 --> 00:08:30.310
this kind of,
uh,

145
00:08:30.310 --> 00:08:35.310
immigration debate that's shaking our country to its core and dividing dinner

146
00:08:35.661 --> 00:08:39.970
tables.
Uh,
good luck on thanksgiving.
Those of you who celebrate that,
right?
Uh,

147
00:08:40.100 --> 00:08:41.090
around the country,

148
00:08:45.400 --> 00:08:48.910
we have lead generation CRM software,
right?

149
00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:52.630
Just keeping track of that contact and see if they want to buy something that's

150
00:08:52.631 --> 00:08:57.631
also now working on border issues and I'm finding themselves in huge amounts of

151
00:08:57.871 --> 00:09:00.840
debates here in California.
That's where I am right now.

152
00:09:04.790 --> 00:09:07.670
Friendly chat APP.
How could that be wrong?

153
00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:12.350
That's somehow used weaponized to not just,

154
00:09:12.730 --> 00:09:13.490
uh,

155
00:09:13.490 --> 00:09:18.270
convince people that they should vote one way or another or to polarize,
uh,

156
00:09:18.300 --> 00:09:22.940
there are political viewpoints,
but actually to create physical harm,

157
00:09:23.150 --> 00:09:24.800
not just to one individual,

158
00:09:25.070 --> 00:09:30.020
but a genocide against an entire group,
an ethnic group,

159
00:09:30.220 --> 00:09:32.780
uh,
identity,
right?
Um,

160
00:09:33.320 --> 00:09:38.320
none of these things where what we as developers and HR people and accounting

161
00:09:38.721 --> 00:09:41.600
people,
and none of this was on my job description.

162
00:09:41.720 --> 00:09:43.580
None of this is what I envisioned for the future.

163
00:09:45.770 --> 00:09:50.690
So how exactly did we get here?
Well,
I will tell you,
uh,

164
00:09:50.840 --> 00:09:53.810
that it's not out of malice.

165
00:09:54.230 --> 00:09:58.170
It is not out of some crazy hell bent,
you know,
uh,

166
00:09:58.250 --> 00:10:00.770
evil comic book character that wants to create this stuff.

167
00:10:01.160 --> 00:10:02.570
It's out of good intentions,

168
00:10:03.020 --> 00:10:06.920
but these good intentions are not counterbalanced by our own.

169
00:10:07.160 --> 00:10:10.850
What could possibly go wrong thinking,
right?
So you know,

170
00:10:10.851 --> 00:10:13.670
you're going to Costa Rica and you're about to jump on a zip line.

171
00:10:13.820 --> 00:10:18.260
Something in your body says,
I don't know if this is for me,
right?

172
00:10:18.500 --> 00:10:22.220
Because one thing that I've learned in the risk business is risk is personal and

173
00:10:22.221 --> 00:10:25.820
something that you might say it's super risky might be to your friend.

174
00:10:25.940 --> 00:10:28.610
Totally good idea on Saturday morning.
But,
uh,

175
00:10:28.670 --> 00:10:30.440
when that is taken out of the equation,

176
00:10:30.441 --> 00:10:32.760
when your agency is taking out of the equation and you're calming,

177
00:10:32.761 --> 00:10:36.110
tend to take it out of the equation,
good intentions go bad very quickly.

178
00:10:38.610 --> 00:10:40.380
Why are you listening to me?
Well,

179
00:10:40.381 --> 00:10:44.460
hopefully it's because of that awesome glamour shot of a photo that you saw on

180
00:10:44.461 --> 00:10:47.640
the paper outside.
Or maybe you got a cold email from when your friends.

181
00:10:47.641 --> 00:10:48.960
Thank you.
Um,

182
00:10:49.110 --> 00:10:54.110
but who am I to tell you about this golden hour of the Internet and who am I to

183
00:10:54.271 --> 00:10:57.690
tell you what I think you should or should not be involved in doing,
right?

184
00:10:57.870 --> 00:11:01.080
Or this is what you came for.
Everybody.
We're still,
you're still with me.
Okay,

185
00:11:01.081 --> 00:11:04.190
let's go.
Just check.
Okay.
It's,
uh,

186
00:11:04.230 --> 00:11:07.470
well I'm a hacker and I'm a security researcher and I'm giving you the slides.

187
00:11:07.471 --> 00:11:09.900
You can read about all this other stuff,
but um,
you know,

188
00:11:09.901 --> 00:11:12.750
some of you I've had fellowships with in the audience.
Thank you.

189
00:11:12.900 --> 00:11:14.670
Those are awesome opportunities.
Uh,

190
00:11:14.700 --> 00:11:18.300
currently I worked with a group called tactical tech and I'm the director of

191
00:11:18.301 --> 00:11:22.200
Digital Safety and privacy.
Okay.
Uh,

192
00:11:22.230 --> 00:11:25.710
I work with the umbrella organization called the Movement for black lives,

193
00:11:25.920 --> 00:11:30.660
60 organizations about working for improvement of black bodies inside the United

194
00:11:30.660 --> 00:11:32.970
States,
keeping them alive and healthy.
Right.
Um,

195
00:11:33.450 --> 00:11:34.770
some of the groups are well known,

196
00:11:34.771 --> 00:11:37.590
like black lives matter and some of the groups you might not have heard of like

197
00:11:37.591 --> 00:11:40.830
black youth project 100,
each of them different.
Trying to help.

198
00:11:42.270 --> 00:11:45.110
I do digital work advising them.
I do digital work advising,

199
00:11:45.120 --> 00:11:48.150
a civil rights group called color of change where I had a fellowship for 10

200
00:11:48.151 --> 00:11:48.720
months,

201
00:11:48.720 --> 00:11:51.660
helping them change the trajectory of their organization from one that was an

202
00:11:51.661 --> 00:11:55.960
awesome nonprofit to a not awesome nonprofit that was aware of digital threats

203
00:11:56.020 --> 00:11:56.980
and doing something about it.

204
00:11:57.150 --> 00:11:59.530
Kind of like how you all do with your amazing digital hygiene.

205
00:12:01.900 --> 00:12:05.140
And currently I'm an advisor to the Internet Freedom Festival,

206
00:12:05.260 --> 00:12:07.750
which is an advantage in Valencia,
Spain that happens every year,

207
00:12:07.990 --> 00:12:09.250
which I invite you all to,

208
00:12:09.400 --> 00:12:12.340
which is an amazing place where you can meet people who were creating amazing

209
00:12:12.341 --> 00:12:16.690
technologies but also individuals in country on the front line so to speak,

210
00:12:16.810 --> 00:12:20.010
who are using those technologies to better themselves.
Uh,

211
00:12:20.080 --> 00:12:22.090
I'm an advisor to the open technology fund,

212
00:12:22.420 --> 00:12:26.440
which is a group that hands out financial awards and support.

213
00:12:26.441 --> 00:12:28.840
Maybe you need a red team to make sure your APP is okay,
right?

214
00:12:28.960 --> 00:12:32.470
To anyone who has a great idea and they want to see it happen in the real world,

215
00:12:32.590 --> 00:12:34.030
you don't need VC funding.

216
00:12:34.210 --> 00:12:36.850
You just fill out a web form and if they think this is awesome,

217
00:12:36.940 --> 00:12:38.350
they will give you a financial award.

218
00:12:38.590 --> 00:12:42.370
It could begin it like 200 to 300,000 it can go up to millions of dollars.

219
00:12:42.670 --> 00:12:46.960
Some of the apps that some of you might use like signal or tour are people who

220
00:12:46.961 --> 00:12:48.940
are recipients of this funding year of a year.

221
00:12:50.110 --> 00:12:53.110
I'm an advisor to the National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers.

222
00:12:53.560 --> 00:12:57.520
Sometimes someone's freedom is in the balance over a lawyers understanding of

223
00:12:57.521 --> 00:13:00.130
what an Ip addresses and things like that.
But let me tell you,

224
00:13:00.131 --> 00:13:04.060
it's probably not as strong as you might think.
So,
uh,
I'm here to tell them like,

225
00:13:04.061 --> 00:13:08.800
hey,
if you see this in a case pushed back a little bit,
maybe that can help you.

226
00:13:09.550 --> 00:13:11.470
And to a group called the human rights foundation,

227
00:13:11.620 --> 00:13:13.960
which has an amazing event in Oslo,
Norway,

228
00:13:14.140 --> 00:13:17.860
where I attend to help dissidence in human rights defenders.
Uh,

229
00:13:17.861 --> 00:13:22.210
it's kind of like a Ted talk and you could watch their videos on youtube,
right?

230
00:13:22.450 --> 00:13:27.040
And,
um,
and you can see amazing folks talking about what they face every day.

231
00:13:27.250 --> 00:13:30.580
And I work with technologists there assisting those folks on their digital

232
00:13:30.581 --> 00:13:33.730
hygiene and their health because they face like they're very high risk.

233
00:13:35.770 --> 00:13:38.990
And of course I tell you about my time with Gjs who are,
uh,

234
00:13:38.991 --> 00:13:42.850
I still consider them friends and I'm always there for them when they need help.

235
00:13:43.350 --> 00:13:47.590
Well no matter what continent they're in or who they're assisting,

236
00:13:47.710 --> 00:13:50.500
always great journalists,
nonprofits,
Ngos,

237
00:13:50.501 --> 00:13:53.020
one of the few progressive outfits that does this work.

238
00:13:53.320 --> 00:13:57.600
A lot of these people who do this work are,
uh,
intelligence and military and uh,

239
00:13:57.610 --> 00:13:59.800
it's important to have folks like them.
Okay.

240
00:14:00.700 --> 00:14:04.840
And a tactical tech where I work right now,
three things.
Our data ourselves,

241
00:14:04.841 --> 00:14:07.060
please learn about that.
Exposing the invisible,

242
00:14:07.061 --> 00:14:10.270
which is teaching you to be an investigator and the glass room experience,

243
00:14:10.570 --> 00:14:12.160
which is a physical,

244
00:14:12.161 --> 00:14:15.730
kind of like a black mirror type situation where you walk in and you see real

245
00:14:15.731 --> 00:14:17.080
things that might shock you,

246
00:14:17.081 --> 00:14:19.750
but they're actually real well researched and you learn more about this stuff.

247
00:14:19.910 --> 00:14:22.660
Uh,
it's happening in New York and London and the next one's coming up soon.

248
00:14:22.840 --> 00:14:26.560
Keep an eye on where it's going to drop.
Okay?
So what can we do?

249
00:14:26.650 --> 00:14:29.440
I've talked about this moment.
I said there was a golden hour.

250
00:14:29.470 --> 00:14:33.950
I explained why I should have some authority and steering you your focus,
right?

251
00:14:35.470 --> 00:14:38.100
Well,
I'm not going to tell you to install tor and second home,

252
00:14:38.110 --> 00:14:39.850
but those are important.
You should do that,
right?

253
00:14:40.830 --> 00:14:44.380
I'm not going to tell you to have a password manager or about fuzzing or all

254
00:14:44.381 --> 00:14:47.500
kinds of cool stuff about application security.
Um,
but yeah,

255
00:14:47.530 --> 00:14:48.740
please learn that if you write code,

256
00:14:50.260 --> 00:14:51.860
I'm not going to tell you that there's a weakest link.

257
00:14:52.130 --> 00:14:54.080
Like these doors only have one handle on each one.

258
00:14:54.230 --> 00:14:56.300
And if one person doesn't wash their hands,
we all get sick.

259
00:14:56.450 --> 00:14:59.180
And that's what digital hygiene is,
right?
I'm not going to tell you about that.

260
00:14:59.240 --> 00:15:00.830
There's amazing people here.
I can tell you about that.

261
00:15:02.570 --> 00:15:07.570
I'm going to tell you that it's our job to fix it because we're the best minds

262
00:15:08.180 --> 00:15:12.200
around this world.
Uh,
that's what working at this company does.

263
00:15:12.201 --> 00:15:15.920
It collects these amazing people who you only have one thing in common with,

264
00:15:16.010 --> 00:15:17.810
which was that you both got through the interview process,

265
00:15:17.811 --> 00:15:20.870
but you see them more than you see anyone,
including yourself in the mirror.

266
00:15:23.060 --> 00:15:24.170
And there's no one else coming,

267
00:15:24.320 --> 00:15:27.260
which is something that we learn every day when I'm working in real world

268
00:15:27.261 --> 00:15:31.310
environments.
You're,
it's so you volunteered.
That's it.

269
00:15:31.370 --> 00:15:35.220
There's no one who's a doctor on site on the scene.
No,
that's is you,
right.

270
00:15:36.350 --> 00:15:40.010
Take action.
Do something now.
Right.

271
00:15:40.280 --> 00:15:42.980
So I will say a detective and find the source of the bleeding,

272
00:15:43.220 --> 00:15:46.160
which is local spaces,
offline spaces.

273
00:15:46.430 --> 00:15:50.240
You have a friend and that friend is an activist because they wrote a letter to

274
00:15:50.241 --> 00:15:51.350
their congressman,
right?

275
00:15:51.500 --> 00:15:53.570
Or maybe they're an activist cause they're marching at a protest.

276
00:15:53.571 --> 00:15:57.290
But you have a friend that is the activist in out of all your friends,
right?

277
00:15:57.410 --> 00:15:59.450
You have a family member that is like,
hey,

278
00:15:59.451 --> 00:16:02.690
should I click on this link and just get my complete internet world taken,

279
00:16:03.290 --> 00:16:06.890
take time out of this hard work that we do to speak to them about the internet

280
00:16:06.891 --> 00:16:09.770
that we know and unlearned from them.
Not just talk to them,

281
00:16:09.771 --> 00:16:12.480
but like listen twice as hard.
Right?
I'll play this video five time.

282
00:16:13.760 --> 00:16:16.280
That's what I do.
Um,

283
00:16:17.090 --> 00:16:18.950
the patient needs air to survive.

284
00:16:19.520 --> 00:16:22.490
You have to breathe in new and innovative fresh ideas.

285
00:16:22.790 --> 00:16:26.900
But these new and innovative fresh ideas aren't the normal fail fast ideas that

286
00:16:26.901 --> 00:16:30.410
you come up with their ideas where you're holding onto what was the good

287
00:16:30.411 --> 00:16:34.490
intention that led this idea and you're counter balancing it with what is the

288
00:16:34.491 --> 00:16:36.890
negative side effect for all people,

289
00:16:37.340 --> 00:16:41.210
which means there's someone in a village somewhere on this planet and the tool

290
00:16:41.211 --> 00:16:45.050
that I'm making will somehow be used to hurt them or kill them because of their

291
00:16:45.051 --> 00:16:45.770
identity.

292
00:16:45.770 --> 00:16:49.700
It has such a far stretch and it's a really hard challenge for me to tell you to

293
00:16:49.701 --> 00:16:50.450
do this.

294
00:16:50.450 --> 00:16:55.450
But just thinking like how could this go horribly wrong in like insane scenario

295
00:16:56.060 --> 00:16:59.780
because unfortunately for some strange reason,
that's the world we're in.

296
00:17:02.390 --> 00:17:06.200
And uh,
with like for example,
hypothermia,
um,

297
00:17:06.470 --> 00:17:09.110
don't let the cold and I'm going to set in,
right.

298
00:17:09.560 --> 00:17:12.860
It seems like these ideas and these concepts of these things that are happening

299
00:17:12.861 --> 00:17:14.090
are bigger than all of us,

300
00:17:14.510 --> 00:17:18.000
but find small and large ways that you can contribute to,
uh,

301
00:17:18.200 --> 00:17:21.380
fighting these vulnerabilities.
Right.
And,
uh,
for example,

302
00:17:21.980 --> 00:17:25.610
don't spread fake news because you went to full fact.org and you learned about

303
00:17:25.611 --> 00:17:29.360
how to fact check on the Internet and you can have a 10 hour conversation

304
00:17:29.361 --> 00:17:31.820
because someone hit you at the wrong moment where you're like,
ah,

305
00:17:31.821 --> 00:17:36.410
on Facebook or some other app that you do not use.
Right?
And um,

306
00:17:36.850 --> 00:17:41.360
and instead of coming at them with your full,
uh,
hey,
that's wrong,

307
00:17:41.540 --> 00:17:45.650
maybe you can say,
let's fact check that together.
Check out this link.

308
00:17:45.830 --> 00:17:47.780
Let's go through this.
Oh,
wow.
So strange.

309
00:17:47.781 --> 00:17:52.200
I thought that at one point this is what's really going on.
Okay,
okay,
boom.

310
00:17:53.300 --> 00:17:53.880
Um,

311
00:17:53.880 --> 00:17:58.410
but most of all we have to hope for the best because recovery is not guaranteed.

312
00:17:58.890 --> 00:18:01.920
There's no one telling you that this is going to be a magic,
wonderful ending,

313
00:18:02.340 --> 00:18:02.730
right?

314
00:18:02.730 --> 00:18:06.510
I've worked with people who I don't see anymore because they've disappeared or

315
00:18:06.511 --> 00:18:10.050
they're incarcerated or the company,
the country,
they're in this taken away.

316
00:18:10.051 --> 00:18:12.430
There are means to travel,
right?
Um,

317
00:18:13.350 --> 00:18:16.410
but you have to know that you did your best and you have to know that you were

318
00:18:16.411 --> 00:18:20.400
there and you tried.
And that is what keeps you going.
That's what keeps me going.

319
00:18:21.960 --> 00:18:25.140
Okay.
So here's my contact info.
Please follow me on Twitter.

320
00:18:25.141 --> 00:18:25.974
I'm just a little egg.

321
00:18:26.010 --> 00:18:28.980
I'm rushing through my slides cause I really want to do Q and a with the people

322
00:18:28.981 --> 00:18:31.190
online and the people in this room.
Right.

323
00:18:31.480 --> 00:18:36.480
<v 3>One trend that I think a lot of us we're seeing in technology is and users,</v>

324
00:18:37.820 --> 00:18:38.260
um,

325
00:18:38.260 --> 00:18:43.260
requests to kind of adapt their experience in terms of sharing location,

326
00:18:43.811 --> 00:18:45.400
maybe including payment details.

327
00:18:45.760 --> 00:18:50.560
What's a good balance between providing users that agency and not having a

328
00:18:50.561 --> 00:18:55.561
common editorial explosion of how can my piece of software handle all these

329
00:18:55.691 --> 00:18:59.470
different cases based on what people are interested in doing and sharing?

330
00:18:59.530 --> 00:19:01.270
<v 0>Yeah.
The question is basically it's like,
you know,</v>

331
00:19:01.370 --> 00:19:06.370
how can we gave users agency and power over their privacy and security settings

332
00:19:06.620 --> 00:19:08.620
without creating road bumps and,
and difficult,

333
00:19:08.621 --> 00:19:11.630
you're even scaring them away from the core thing that we're trying to delight

334
00:19:11.631 --> 00:19:14.840
them with,
which is this app or tool or something like that.
Does that sound good?

335
00:19:14.940 --> 00:19:16.230
Okay.
So,
um,

336
00:19:17.060 --> 00:19:21.760
there's a UX checklist which is something that,
uh,
you know,
I was at this,
uh,

337
00:19:21.770 --> 00:19:25.550
event called rights con.
It happens in a different country every year.

338
00:19:26.120 --> 00:19:29.960
Last year it was in Toronto,
but when I was at writes Khan in Brussels,
uh,

339
00:19:30.020 --> 00:19:34.310
which is the center of the EU,
uh,
there was this idea like,
you know,

340
00:19:34.370 --> 00:19:36.830
when in my work we have a checklist for everything we do.

341
00:19:36.860 --> 00:19:40.400
It's literally like a laminated piece of paper with boxes on it and take it a

342
00:19:40.401 --> 00:19:42.200
black crayon and you just put xs through.

343
00:19:42.390 --> 00:19:44.330
Do you ever read the checklist manifesto?

344
00:19:44.510 --> 00:19:48.680
It's because you as a human being cannot be trusted to do high security things

345
00:19:48.980 --> 00:19:52.100
because tactical tech teaches us in some of the books that you know,

346
00:19:52.101 --> 00:19:55.700
that group has researched and done is that holistic security is real.

347
00:19:55.850 --> 00:19:58.440
When you're stressed out and you think Tongans horrible is happening or

348
00:19:58.441 --> 00:20:01.730
someone's banging on the door,
all your amazing skills get dropped.

349
00:20:01.731 --> 00:20:05.360
You become a nine year old rant.
So what if there was a UX checklist?

350
00:20:05.570 --> 00:20:08.900
Just something lightweight that as you design your tools and your working with

351
00:20:08.960 --> 00:20:12.380
Qa and the core devs and people do interface and design,

352
00:20:12.470 --> 00:20:16.130
you all can meet and just be like,
well,
are we really thinking about this users,

353
00:20:16.131 --> 00:20:19.340
this or that?
Right?
And also what is something that's like a,

354
00:20:19.500 --> 00:20:23.110
a dark pattern in new eyes that could be wrong here.
What is something that,
um,

355
00:20:23.210 --> 00:20:26.660
as a,
as a person using this in a at risk environment,

356
00:20:26.780 --> 00:20:30.350
I would need to use this still and not have it hurt me.
Um,

357
00:20:30.560 --> 00:20:34.320
those are really basic questions and uh,
this checklist like exist,

358
00:20:34.321 --> 00:20:37.850
it's on get hub and I will tweet it out.
Right?
And uh,

359
00:20:37.940 --> 00:20:39.260
anyone who wants to add things to it,

360
00:20:39.261 --> 00:20:42.440
please do because that's what it's all about open source.
Right?
Um,

361
00:20:43.280 --> 00:20:48.100
but I would say there was a time when there were no privacy security settings.

362
00:20:48.280 --> 00:20:52.420
I use using apps and tools and building stuff has developer and it just was not

363
00:20:52.421 --> 00:20:55.970
a thing at all.
It was maybe something on the server.
Right?
Um,

364
00:20:56.020 --> 00:21:00.490
slowly we brought that to the front end and we actually gave users control over

365
00:21:00.491 --> 00:21:04.360
those things.
And right now it's like,
you know,
like my friend Martins Prius,

366
00:21:04.480 --> 00:21:05.560
really simple buttons,

367
00:21:05.800 --> 00:21:10.150
but one day it'll be more nuanced controls and dials as the need comes.

368
00:21:10.330 --> 00:21:13.420
But we have to meet people when they need them.
And you know,

369
00:21:13.421 --> 00:21:16.660
there are other tools out there like this app signal where it's designed to have

370
00:21:16.661 --> 00:21:17.740
no advanced mode,

371
00:21:18.010 --> 00:21:22.480
no settings because it itself is designed to beat the most high risk setting.

372
00:21:22.810 --> 00:21:27.190
And that's another way that you can blow past having a problem.
Right.
Um,
so yeah.

373
00:21:27.280 --> 00:21:31.450
Anyway,
next question.
Thank you.
First question,
I will find a prize for you.
Yeah.

374
00:21:32.660 --> 00:21:34.280
<v 4>John Asks,
Matt,</v>

375
00:21:34.281 --> 00:21:37.790
what are your thoughts on the current state and potential of automation and

376
00:21:37.791 --> 00:21:42.140
detection slash my mitigation of threats during the Golden Hour and how that

377
00:21:42.141 --> 00:21:47.110
approach be integrated with human expertise for maximum effectiveness and,
okay,

378
00:21:47.860 --> 00:21:48.693
<v 0>thank you.</v>

379
00:21:48.700 --> 00:21:52.630
This is a great question and it's about my thoughts on how we can leverage

380
00:21:52.631 --> 00:21:57.631
computers to assist us in responding faster in this most delicate and dangerous

381
00:21:58.421 --> 00:22:01.240
time.
Right.
And we ready,
uh,

382
00:22:01.320 --> 00:22:04.330
anyone out there who's a bug bounty person who's,
you know,

383
00:22:04.331 --> 00:22:07.450
it was like spends nights and weekends looking for software flaws and getting

384
00:22:07.451 --> 00:22:10.140
gift cards or tee shirts or maybe 50 bucks here or there.
Um,

385
00:22:10.240 --> 00:22:14.170
we'll understand and tell you that you can no longer just sit there and do this

386
00:22:14.171 --> 00:22:17.800
stuff by yourself.
These apps and tools are not built by one person.

387
00:22:17.980 --> 00:22:19.960
And so you're not going to tech your way in.
No hacker,

388
00:22:19.961 --> 00:22:23.800
no nation state hacker works that way.
We use fathers,
we use computers,

389
00:22:23.920 --> 00:22:27.280
we use all kinds of different things,
right?
Those are the tricks of the trade.

390
00:22:27.310 --> 00:22:30.130
If you're a capital a flag person and you're,
you know,

391
00:22:30.131 --> 00:22:33.070
playing the Games where your red team,
blue team or purple team,

392
00:22:33.160 --> 00:22:35.380
or if you don't even understand what I'm talking about,
uh,

393
00:22:35.500 --> 00:22:40.500
computers are used now by the most elite of people in Infosec and cyber to do

394
00:22:41.051 --> 00:22:41.860
that.

395
00:22:41.860 --> 00:22:46.860
And the only good thing about this is that the adversary is mostly human led and

396
00:22:47.651 --> 00:22:48.670
computer assisted.

397
00:22:49.060 --> 00:22:53.290
But in the future and in what my friends who are telling me from like different

398
00:22:53.291 --> 00:22:56.710
parts of the world,
they're seeing more are completely automated threats,

399
00:22:56.890 --> 00:22:59.380
like very dumb Roomba level intelligence.

400
00:22:59.530 --> 00:23:04.060
But a hacker that's persistent and hammers at things all day and knows like the

401
00:23:04.061 --> 00:23:06.940
off the top 10 and is already doing that stuff right?

402
00:23:07.090 --> 00:23:10.390
But that hacker is not a human being is scanning the internet or scanning a

403
00:23:10.391 --> 00:23:14.380
particular place like a industrial controls and Ukrainian and just looking for a

404
00:23:14.381 --> 00:23:18.640
way in one day that hacker is going to be on some terminator two level of

405
00:23:18.641 --> 00:23:22.000
intelligence.
And we only can stop it with automated help,

406
00:23:22.180 --> 00:23:27.180
but we have to have that counterbalance and we have to always have some human

407
00:23:27.400 --> 00:23:31.270
level.
Well this is just why,
like if you look at the most dangerous of weapons,

408
00:23:31.390 --> 00:23:35.200
whether their nuclear missiles or something that can completely disrupt,
uh,

409
00:23:35.230 --> 00:23:36.070
political events,

410
00:23:36.430 --> 00:23:40.230
there's usually a human involved and not just one human in case our compromise

411
00:23:40.240 --> 00:23:41.200
or something happens,
right?

412
00:23:41.380 --> 00:23:45.040
So we know about this nuclear football and I think like that is how we can move

413
00:23:45.050 --> 00:23:45.920
it moving forward.

414
00:23:46.040 --> 00:23:50.360
I'm happy to tweet out examples of things that we could be using right now.

415
00:23:50.450 --> 00:23:52.940
Just make our code safer to make our stuff safer,

416
00:23:53.000 --> 00:23:55.580
to just scan stuff and just look for code smells and weird,

417
00:23:55.700 --> 00:23:57.170
weird things that we might not have thought.
Right.

418
00:23:58.050 --> 00:24:01.880
<v 5>Thanks for joining us.
Thank you for being here.
I'm really glad to have you.
Um,</v>

419
00:24:02.340 --> 00:24:07.340
I had a question about the golden hour in the context of climate change.

420
00:24:08.550 --> 00:24:13.550
So obviously computing is very resource intensive and we have no shortage of fun

421
00:24:15.871 --> 00:24:20.220
ways to abuse the hell out of a CPU is like bitcoin and stuff like that.

422
00:24:20.620 --> 00:24:21.453
Um,

423
00:24:21.930 --> 00:24:26.760
and to the point where it might even take up resources a greater than entire

424
00:24:26.761 --> 00:24:31.390
countries.
I wonder,
do you have any thoughts about the intersection between,
um,

425
00:24:32.160 --> 00:24:34.690
this sense of urgency behind,
uh,

426
00:24:35.610 --> 00:24:40.470
being an active person in the technology space and climate change?

427
00:24:40.471 --> 00:24:41.304
What we can do?

428
00:24:41.740 --> 00:24:44.270
<v 0>Okay.
Well,
if you're living on the planet today and your breathing,</v>

429
00:24:44.540 --> 00:24:48.320
you really should read climate change studies that just been dropped by the UN

430
00:24:48.440 --> 00:24:51.770
and other environmental groups has,
um,
you're an intelligent person.

431
00:24:51.771 --> 00:24:54.020
You're probably one of the smartest people in your friend circle.

432
00:24:54.170 --> 00:24:56.990
And you need to be,
you need to understand what's going on,
right?

433
00:24:57.170 --> 00:24:59.720
So there's questions about how do us,
the people who like,
you know,

434
00:24:59.721 --> 00:25:00.261
where the team here,

435
00:25:00.261 --> 00:25:03.800
we're working on computers and technology and those computers and technology.

436
00:25:03.801 --> 00:25:07.640
One thing I teach people that Crypto Harlem is every website you go to is a box

437
00:25:07.641 --> 00:25:10.760
with a cable going into it and a power cord.
Like that's it.

438
00:25:10.790 --> 00:25:14.450
You go to all these amazing digital tools,
they live on this planet.

439
00:25:14.630 --> 00:25:18.770
They create and consume heat and electricity and they are damaging this planet

440
00:25:18.771 --> 00:25:22.940
that we live on.
And because of the surge of things like,
you know,
Dan,
you know,

441
00:25:23.130 --> 00:25:26.630
uh,
their economic conditions that create people needing to do crypto mining,

442
00:25:26.720 --> 00:25:30.380
whether it's Bitcoin,
I'm a narrow or,
or other things,
right?
So,
um,

443
00:25:31.100 --> 00:25:35.570
what are we doing to offset that?
And honestly,
we're not doing enough.

444
00:25:35.720 --> 00:25:40.160
You can take a flight across country for a corporation and you can offset that

445
00:25:40.190 --> 00:25:41.840
carbon footprint by saying,
hey,

446
00:25:41.841 --> 00:25:46.280
I'd like to check this box and let plant some trees.
But you can't say,
Hey,

447
00:25:46.281 --> 00:25:50.270
what does it measure of my team and my work that's damaging the environment?

448
00:25:50.360 --> 00:25:53.900
And how does the corporation I worked for use that money that they might support

449
00:25:53.901 --> 00:25:57.770
a 10K or my nonprofit stuff.
By the way,
if you work anywhere,
uh,

450
00:25:57.800 --> 00:25:59.360
please understand the company you work for,

451
00:25:59.510 --> 00:26:03.260
we'll pay you to get a day off in like help a nonprofit or we're helping good

452
00:26:03.261 --> 00:26:04.010
group,
right?

453
00:26:04.010 --> 00:26:08.810
Or run a 10 K but one day we'll take that funding and also offset the work of

454
00:26:08.811 --> 00:26:13.280
our keyboard tapping and our servers and all our labs and the Qa costs.
Um,

455
00:26:13.320 --> 00:26:15.980
there are some people,
for example,
this group green host,

456
00:26:16.220 --> 00:26:20.630
which is an ISP and a data center that is completely designed to be

457
00:26:20.631 --> 00:26:22.080
environmentally friendly,
right?

458
00:26:22.310 --> 00:26:25.010
And there are people who are pushing for open hardware initiatives,

459
00:26:25.040 --> 00:26:27.530
which will do this.
We need to get behind this.

460
00:26:27.710 --> 00:26:32.570
Otherwise there's literally like blood on our hands.
And when our,
uh,
you know,

461
00:26:32.571 --> 00:26:36.380
the younger generation of people on this planet are coughing and wheezing and

462
00:26:36.381 --> 00:26:39.590
asking what we did,
we're going to say,
we actually created problems for you,

463
00:26:39.830 --> 00:26:42.530
right?
And we need to say we were coding a better future,

464
00:26:42.680 --> 00:26:46.650
but we are not destroying the planet while we're doing that.
Right.
So,
um,

465
00:26:46.680 --> 00:26:49.770
thank you.
I hope that,
does it feel like a good answer?
Uh,
but yes,

466
00:26:51.890 --> 00:26:55.920
I'm on person.
Real world person.
I know the questions inside of you.
Let it out.

467
00:26:56.830 --> 00:27:01.830
<v 4>What do you think about the prospect to sort of increasing the futility of op</v>

468
00:27:03.641 --> 00:27:06.490
sec and hygiene?
You know,
we,

469
00:27:07.600 --> 00:27:11.640
even if you opt out of virtually everything and all the advantages at town

470
00:27:11.710 --> 00:27:12.700
technology offers,

471
00:27:13.000 --> 00:27:18.000
everybody around you is engaging in that you could be mapped and tracked and

472
00:27:18.791 --> 00:27:21.430
identified even without opting in.

473
00:27:21.530 --> 00:27:25.700
<v 0>Yeah.
I mean,
um,
sometimes I'm working with folks who need to go underground.</v>

474
00:27:25.970 --> 00:27:27.050
They just need to be safe.

475
00:27:27.080 --> 00:27:31.220
Whether you're an investigative reporter or someone who's a source that helped

476
00:27:31.221 --> 00:27:33.140
an NGA do an Ngo do amazing work,

477
00:27:33.141 --> 00:27:36.800
but you're living in country at risk and you cannot be like on the grid at that

478
00:27:36.801 --> 00:27:37.850
moment.
It's too hot.

479
00:27:37.880 --> 00:27:41.900
You need to just go somewhere and it's hard cause there's shadow profiles.

480
00:27:41.901 --> 00:27:45.410
It's hard because your phone going off as an indicator that like you're missing

481
00:27:45.411 --> 00:27:48.980
from this pattern and a computers and AI are looking at those patterns,

482
00:27:48.981 --> 00:27:53.180
not sleepy security guards.
Right.
So,
um,
there's this idea,

483
00:27:53.210 --> 00:27:57.230
cause I believe your question is what about op sec in this increasingly digitize

484
00:27:57.231 --> 00:28:01.790
the world,
right?
And I tell people this security nihilism,

485
00:28:02.030 --> 00:28:05.660
like they can see everything anyway.
There's nothing we can do here.

486
00:28:05.690 --> 00:28:09.530
And I work with people who are working and operating and doing amazing,

487
00:28:09.590 --> 00:28:12.980
like they're heroes doing amazing things in the most authoritarian totalitarian

488
00:28:12.981 --> 00:28:13.814
regimes.
Right?

489
00:28:14.060 --> 00:28:18.170
They still get up every morning and try and it's I think like disrespectful to

490
00:28:18.171 --> 00:28:21.140
them to even think like,
Eh,
I don't need my YubiKey today.

491
00:28:21.230 --> 00:28:26.230
Like it's because the actual threats has different levels of skill and your life

492
00:28:27.501 --> 00:28:32.090
shouldn't be ruined by a board 12 year old,
right?
Uh,
you should have earned like,

493
00:28:32.091 --> 00:28:35.630
yeah,
like that high level nation state,
uh,
you know,

494
00:28:35.720 --> 00:28:38.720
advanced persistent threat.
They're the ones that got you.

495
00:28:38.800 --> 00:28:41.380
There are the ones that ruined your day because you know,

496
00:28:41.390 --> 00:28:44.240
we have this idea of defense in depth.
You know,
you build a moat,

497
00:28:44.480 --> 00:28:46.820
then you get the archers,
then you have the drawbridge.

498
00:28:47.000 --> 00:28:51.320
And only the most like agile and persistent attacker or,

499
00:28:51.410 --> 00:28:54.170
or threats is going to get through all of that to touch you.

500
00:28:54.440 --> 00:28:57.200
And most of the time,
people who work nine to five to hurt someone,

501
00:28:57.770 --> 00:28:59.510
they're never going to win against someone who's living,

502
00:28:59.600 --> 00:29:02.690
working all day for liberation of their people or advancement of an amazing

503
00:29:02.691 --> 00:29:07.670
cause.
And so,
um,
if I had this idea creeping in my mind,

504
00:29:07.790 --> 00:29:10.130
I wouldn't be able to do anything.
So it definitely shake it off.

505
00:29:10.190 --> 00:29:15.190
Most of the time it's a quote unquote fake news and you'd be amazed what amazing

506
00:29:15.201 --> 00:29:18.980
stuff you can do and what these people do every day.
Right.
So thank you.

507
00:29:18.981 --> 00:29:19.814
Great question,
John.

508
00:29:20.590 --> 00:29:23.560
<v 4>Yes,
we will get to that.
Stay tuned.
Scott asks,</v>

509
00:29:23.800 --> 00:29:27.550
could you describe some new threads that you see on the horizon as a result of

510
00:29:27.551 --> 00:29:31.540
these new threats?
Where should companies be investing to mitigate these risks?

511
00:29:31.770 --> 00:29:32.670
<v 0>Yes.
Okay.</v>

512
00:29:33.630 --> 00:29:37.020
It's really weird and this is kind of why I'm talking about this this way.

513
00:29:37.021 --> 00:29:40.950
Like when you,
we think about digital threats and digital hygiene and cyber,

514
00:29:40.990 --> 00:29:45.990
we don't think about like sociopolitical issues and economic issues and things

515
00:29:46.181 --> 00:29:49.180
like that,
but that is where these threats live now,
right?

516
00:29:49.540 --> 00:29:53.950
So there's this idea of an insider threat and that threat is you,

517
00:29:54.490 --> 00:29:56.590
you will be compromised at one day,

518
00:29:56.620 --> 00:30:00.130
one point maybe some silly piece of unverified,

519
00:30:00.131 --> 00:30:03.940
fake news is making you think something that is not true,
right?

520
00:30:04.450 --> 00:30:08.290
Maybe you got a gambling debt and there's a bag of cash conveniently left to

521
00:30:08.291 --> 00:30:10.270
your front door.
You pick it up,
you're like,
that's weird.

522
00:30:10.390 --> 00:30:11.350
And then the next day they're like,
Hey,

523
00:30:11.351 --> 00:30:14.770
I saw you use the bag of cash to no questions asked.
When it gets to three,

524
00:30:14.771 --> 00:30:17.260
it's like,
I'm going to tell everyone that you been working with me,
which is,

525
00:30:17.290 --> 00:30:20.890
you know,
this is weird,
but it's true in a weird way,
and now you're,
you're owned,

526
00:30:20.980 --> 00:30:21.520
right?

527
00:30:21.520 --> 00:30:26.520
So the threat is going to be these weird curve ball threats.

528
00:30:27.100 --> 00:30:29.680
They're not things like,
oh,
spare fishing's up.

529
00:30:29.830 --> 00:30:32.850
It's more things like this person who I work with every day,

530
00:30:32.851 --> 00:30:37.240
he was disaffected and disassociated and sad.
They're going to be compromised.

531
00:30:37.390 --> 00:30:38.740
I myself,
I'm that person,

532
00:30:38.830 --> 00:30:41.980
I will be compromised because the thing you love will be used against you.

533
00:30:42.070 --> 00:30:44.410
You love chocolate cake,
you love Oreos.
I love Oreos.

534
00:30:44.600 --> 00:30:48.790
I'm never eating another Oreo could be the thing that makes you,
you know,

535
00:30:48.820 --> 00:30:52.450
just look the other way.
Or maybe it's helping someone you care about,
you know,

536
00:30:52.451 --> 00:30:54.040
maybe it's your friends and your family.

537
00:30:54.160 --> 00:30:58.810
And it's weird because this is the new age that we're in and our corporations

538
00:30:58.811 --> 00:31:02.410
and our organizations and our friend circles are ill equipped and prepared to

539
00:31:02.411 --> 00:31:04.660
deal with this right now.
Right.
Um,

540
00:31:04.900 --> 00:31:09.160
and these are some examples of the threats that are coming for us,
right?

541
00:31:09.250 --> 00:31:14.250
Or random threats where I'm a a well spoken individual on social media and all

542
00:31:14.801 --> 00:31:18.940
of a sudden there's an amassed troll farm that's being paid.

543
00:31:19.060 --> 00:31:24.060
And I've seen these places where it's a small village or a town where a teenager

544
00:31:24.371 --> 00:31:28.600
can make,
um,
uh,
what is equivalent of someone's annual salary,
right.

545
00:31:28.660 --> 00:31:32.440
For working there and just creating and sending hate mail at you or something

546
00:31:32.441 --> 00:31:35.890
like that.
Like,
um,
but it's all not random.

547
00:31:36.190 --> 00:31:39.110
There's something or someone behind this,
right?
Um,

548
00:31:39.220 --> 00:31:42.770
I always tell people when there's a small win and awesome space is something

549
00:31:42.771 --> 00:31:45.760
that stayed in changing the status quo for a grade that we all are happy about.

550
00:31:46.000 --> 00:31:48.310
Someone's experiencing a small loss,
right?

551
00:31:48.580 --> 00:31:51.250
And when there's those rare headline grabbing,
big wins,

552
00:31:51.520 --> 00:31:56.020
someone's experiencing a big loss and this is their game they've never lost and

553
00:31:56.021 --> 00:31:59.230
you become very,
very popular to them.
You don't realize it,

554
00:31:59.231 --> 00:32:02.590
but you're the thorn in someone's side because of a tweet.
Right?

555
00:32:02.830 --> 00:32:04.340
And that is the,

556
00:32:04.390 --> 00:32:07.870
what the new threat looks like and now you have personal attacks against you.

557
00:32:07.900 --> 00:32:09.880
So anyway,
uh,
more questions.
Thanks.

558
00:32:11.290 --> 00:32:15.250
<v 6>Hey man,
thanks for taking the time to be with us today.
Yes.
When,</v>

559
00:32:15.520 --> 00:32:18.430
when you're conducting your crypto Harlem sessions,

560
00:32:18.790 --> 00:32:21.990
what are the protections that you find that people are most receptive to?
Uh,

561
00:32:21.991 --> 00:32:26.350
and then what are some of the tactics that you find people are more resistant to

562
00:32:26.351 --> 00:32:27.010
adopting?

563
00:32:27.010 --> 00:32:30.270
<v 0>Okay.
Well,
you know,
I'm lucky because I'm working with,
uh,
like,
uh,</v>

564
00:32:30.310 --> 00:32:32.620
a high risk group,
which is marginalized people,
right?

565
00:32:32.740 --> 00:32:34.660
In this case it's like black folks in the inner city.

566
00:32:34.960 --> 00:32:39.010
So they're kind of like looking for an antidote to the poison of what's going

567
00:32:39.460 --> 00:32:41.720
right.
Uh,
in Harlem there's like a,

568
00:32:41.721 --> 00:32:44.630
it's like a petri dish of all kinds of weird,

569
00:32:44.720 --> 00:32:49.420
a new crime fighting technologies and surveillance technologies and you know,
uh,

570
00:32:49.830 --> 00:32:53.060
a municipality or city,
they don't need to always pay for this stuff.

571
00:32:53.090 --> 00:32:56.000
Like the company is like,
we need year over year data here,
take it for free,

572
00:32:56.150 --> 00:32:58.850
right?
Like why you'd be full.
Like why would we turn this down?

573
00:32:58.880 --> 00:33:00.890
We're basically getting free stuff that might help,
right?

574
00:33:01.100 --> 00:33:04.700
And then all of a sudden you have an area of your city or your town or province

575
00:33:04.701 --> 00:33:08.150
in your country where it's different from everywhere else where there's almost

576
00:33:08.151 --> 00:33:12.020
like checkpoints were almost like everyone lives in a different life and because

577
00:33:12.021 --> 00:33:13.970
you don't always there,
you don't see it.

578
00:33:14.240 --> 00:33:17.600
So maybe that might be Oakland for people who live in this region.

579
00:33:17.660 --> 00:33:21.390
Maybe there's one street that's so weird,
but you don't experience it.

580
00:33:21.391 --> 00:33:22.760
And people there don't ever leave it.

581
00:33:22.910 --> 00:33:26.750
And that's where this is growing and the things people are receptive to our

582
00:33:26.751 --> 00:33:29.120
stuff that just immediately solves that problem.

583
00:33:29.300 --> 00:33:32.030
And when you're dealing with people who are marginalized and they're therefore

584
00:33:32.031 --> 00:33:36.920
pushed to the margins,
whether it's Lgbtq,
uh,
gender nonconforming folks,
uh,

585
00:33:36.921 --> 00:33:40.040
whether it's people who are not,
you know,
don't have a US passport privilege,

586
00:33:40.041 --> 00:33:42.140
right?
And they're hustling and just trying to make this American dream happen.

587
00:33:42.410 --> 00:33:45.320
They're susceptible to all kinds of strange things that we're not always aware

588
00:33:45.321 --> 00:33:47.540
of because we're not seeing it every day.

589
00:33:47.810 --> 00:33:52.370
And they will grab at setting up two factor,
you bet.

590
00:33:52.430 --> 00:33:55.490
Using secure comms on their phone.
They got three APPS,
they're like,

591
00:33:55.520 --> 00:33:56.600
I want to download that.

592
00:33:56.960 --> 00:34:00.440
The more resistance I find is that people who are less directly affected,

593
00:34:00.800 --> 00:34:04.310
maybe they love someone or care about someone who's directly affected and then

594
00:34:04.311 --> 00:34:09.080
the least is someone who these things seem so obscure.

595
00:34:09.290 --> 00:34:12.260
And even the idea when I tell people this stuff was happening and I show them my

596
00:34:12.261 --> 00:34:14.990
research or show them photos of it,
it just seems so bizarre.

597
00:34:15.230 --> 00:34:17.990
It just can't wrap your mind on it.
And that's where the resistance is.

598
00:34:18.200 --> 00:34:21.110
And that is actually the by design,
right?

599
00:34:21.350 --> 00:34:24.380
So by the time this stuff reaches them,
it's done right.

600
00:34:24.381 --> 00:34:26.450
Like when they're directly affected,
we lost.

601
00:34:26.690 --> 00:34:31.250
So my goal and my hope is try to do stuff you wouldn't normally do and really

602
00:34:31.251 --> 00:34:32.930
empathize the folks around you.

603
00:34:32.970 --> 00:34:36.200
They're living a different world that you might not realize.
Anyway,
that's it.

604
00:34:36.260 --> 00:34:38.330
Right?
Um,
the question was like,

605
00:34:38.660 --> 00:34:43.070
what do people who are marginalized or Crypto Harlem pacifically use more than

606
00:34:43.071 --> 00:34:44.270
other things,
but mobile phones,

607
00:34:44.510 --> 00:34:46.250
everyone in the inner city has got a mobile phone.

608
00:34:46.400 --> 00:34:47.630
They don't always have laptops.

609
00:34:47.750 --> 00:34:50.720
They can consume technology and they can use stuff,

610
00:34:50.840 --> 00:34:54.170
but they can't create and their innovative folks,
they can't create.

611
00:34:54.171 --> 00:34:57.080
It's really weird.
So they're purposely consumers and I try to read them.

612
00:34:57.081 --> 00:34:58.160
They're on their phones.
Okay.

613
00:34:58.520 --> 00:35:02.240
<v 4>You mentioned that young people share their thoughts in online platforms and</v>

614
00:35:02.241 --> 00:35:05.360
then are affected or compromised when a friend and their circle is accused of a

615
00:35:05.361 --> 00:35:08.420
crime quote,
black people have two degrees of separation.

616
00:35:09.050 --> 00:35:10.340
Can you explain more about that

617
00:35:10.630 --> 00:35:12.070
<v 0>care?
First of all,</v>

618
00:35:12.071 --> 00:35:15.040
I get that question is I talk about how black people have two degrees of

619
00:35:15.041 --> 00:35:19.480
separation.
I talk about how young folks online or sharing gives their lives,

620
00:35:19.600 --> 00:35:23.290
but then not everyone has the same price for that chair.
Right.
Um,

621
00:35:23.800 --> 00:35:27.460
the Dj of Crypto Harlem is Dj blackout,
right?
Um,

622
00:35:27.520 --> 00:35:28.810
but his name is Jelani.

623
00:35:28.811 --> 00:35:33.070
Henry and Jelani lives around the corner from me and he spent 14 months in

624
00:35:33.071 --> 00:35:37.560
Rikers island prison,
which might not mean anything to you,
but in New York,

625
00:35:37.561 --> 00:35:39.240
it's one of the worst places you could ever be.
Like,

626
00:35:39.241 --> 00:35:41.400
there's a huge initiative to shut this place down.

627
00:35:41.850 --> 00:35:45.420
He was spending his time waiting for his day in court in one of the worst

628
00:35:45.421 --> 00:35:50.160
prisons in the United States with murderers and killers and horrible people,

629
00:35:50.161 --> 00:35:52.800
but also with awesome people who just have been like on the wrong side of the

630
00:35:52.801 --> 00:35:57.720
law.
Or was it people who couldn't pay $10 bail and are now spending a year in

631
00:35:57.721 --> 00:36:01.800
prison.
And um,
he was one of those people,
if you read,
if you go to the verge,

632
00:36:01.801 --> 00:36:06.720
which is a,
a website,
which is not a Google website,
I don't know why,
but um,

633
00:36:07.080 --> 00:36:09.600
and they talk about reviews and electronics and technology.

634
00:36:09.720 --> 00:36:12.090
But this story resonated with them and they wrote about it.

635
00:36:12.091 --> 00:36:16.350
So if you type in Nyp d Harlem youth,
you can read the story,

636
00:36:16.530 --> 00:36:17.311
no fake news,

637
00:36:17.311 --> 00:36:21.090
you can get the details and it's a lot richer than what I can explain.

638
00:36:21.240 --> 00:36:24.160
But that's just one case of a real person.
If you,
um,

639
00:36:24.250 --> 00:36:26.010
there is a blog called the intercepts,

640
00:36:26.190 --> 00:36:29.160
which is Glenn Greenwald and Laura portraits and a bunch of other folks and a

641
00:36:29.161 --> 00:36:32.340
bunch of my friends shout out to y'all.
Um,
and uh,

642
00:36:32.341 --> 00:36:35.310
they had an article on this thing of gang conspiracy charge and a gang

643
00:36:35.311 --> 00:36:39.120
conspiracy charge is a charge excuse to stop gangs and it doesn't require a

644
00:36:39.121 --> 00:36:40.170
large amount of evidence.

645
00:36:40.260 --> 00:36:44.110
The evidence could literally be you click the thumbs up on a post,
right?

646
00:36:44.310 --> 00:36:48.360
The evidence literally is in these cases,
your phone number is in my cell phone,

647
00:36:48.570 --> 00:36:51.240
right?
And places like Anaheim in California,

648
00:36:51.420 --> 00:36:55.470
there's these things called gang injunctions.
Another thing to stop gangs where,

649
00:36:55.550 --> 00:36:59.130
uh,
you can sue a gang.
The gang obviously does not show up to court,
right?

650
00:36:59.370 --> 00:37:03.870
And you win.
And what happens is in certain parts of the Co of this neighborhood,

651
00:37:03.990 --> 00:37:06.420
it's illegal to have more than four or five people meet.

652
00:37:06.600 --> 00:37:10.230
It's illegal to wear certain colors and worked to an outfit or even stop at a

653
00:37:10.231 --> 00:37:14.230
corner or bring tools or bags with you.
If you want to learn more about this.
Um,

654
00:37:14.430 --> 00:37:18.450
there's an Al Jazeera documentary called Anaheim or it's called fault lines

655
00:37:18.451 --> 00:37:20.370
cause it's a series Anaheim,
California.

656
00:37:20.580 --> 00:37:24.090
And you'll learn about this and it'll blow your mind and uh,
you know,

657
00:37:24.120 --> 00:37:25.080
get the details.

658
00:37:25.290 --> 00:37:28.680
I want you to be really critical and pushback and everything I'm saying because

659
00:37:28.681 --> 00:37:31.530
the hard truth is actually harder behind the stuff.
And a,

660
00:37:31.531 --> 00:37:35.280
I know these people and they're amazing human beings who still fight against

661
00:37:35.281 --> 00:37:39.060
this stuff,
right?
And it's happening to people you might see on the Caltrain or,

662
00:37:39.210 --> 00:37:41.670
uh,
on the Bart.
Right?
And you don't even realize it.

663
00:37:44.730 --> 00:37:47.400
Great question.
Anonymous and dope for being anonymous.
Respect

664
00:37:51.180 --> 00:37:54.210
<v 5>so much for your talk is very enlightening.
Um,</v>

665
00:37:54.240 --> 00:37:58.350
one of the questions I have is that you talked about kind of,
uh,

666
00:37:59.010 --> 00:38:01.350
considering the,
uh,
uh,

667
00:38:01.380 --> 00:38:04.800
the negative side effects that can come from the products or technologies that

668
00:38:04.801 --> 00:38:08.700
we create.
Um,
and I think you also mentioned,
uh,

669
00:38:08.760 --> 00:38:13.270
someone what's going on Myanmar with their political situation.
Um,

670
00:38:13.330 --> 00:38:15.900
and when I've heard about that,
um,

671
00:38:16.410 --> 00:38:19.590
one of the concerns that I always had was that,
you know,

672
00:38:19.650 --> 00:38:23.070
as a sheltered silicon valley bubble American,

673
00:38:23.071 --> 00:38:26.530
it's really hard for me to conceptualize the,
uh,

674
00:38:26.580 --> 00:38:30.460
social and ethnic challenges than many other places encounter.

675
00:38:30.600 --> 00:38:34.890
And so it's really hard for me to be able to conceptualize the negative side

676
00:38:34.900 --> 00:38:36.370
effects of the products that I create.

677
00:38:36.850 --> 00:38:41.850
And so I'm really curious as to what strategies you might have in mind for being

678
00:38:42.521 --> 00:38:44.280
able to,
uh,

679
00:38:44.350 --> 00:38:48.130
to consider these neg negative side effects for other cultures or societies that

680
00:38:48.131 --> 00:38:51.640
I'm not necessarily familiar with.
Thank you for asking this question.

681
00:38:51.750 --> 00:38:55.860
<v 0>All right.
So,
uh,
again,
this question is,
listen,
I'm here in my bubble and I,</v>

682
00:38:55.861 --> 00:38:57.610
I'm trying to do this thing you told me.

683
00:38:57.760 --> 00:39:00.220
Think about the negative consequences of this amazing product or tool.

684
00:39:00.221 --> 00:39:04.270
I'm working on,
but like Mine Amar has really far and I've got like five days,

685
00:39:04.330 --> 00:39:08.230
maybe 10 of vacation,
you know.
So what's going on?
Um,

686
00:39:08.560 --> 00:39:12.880
we do user testing for our products internally and externally,

687
00:39:12.940 --> 00:39:15.070
whether it's Starbucks gift cards or people who are part of it,

688
00:39:15.071 --> 00:39:16.180
you a testing group in house,

689
00:39:16.930 --> 00:39:20.170
do user testing for this challenge that I've given you.

690
00:39:20.590 --> 00:39:23.010
And that might be finding out if there's a place where we're hanging,

691
00:39:23.030 --> 00:39:27.280
gather in your most immediate,
maybe like five mile radius.

692
00:39:27.760 --> 00:39:32.080
If you have a American passport privilege and you're in this amazing country,

693
00:39:32.350 --> 00:39:35.080
you'll find that these people are actually like living,
oh,

694
00:39:35.081 --> 00:39:36.640
right here you'll be like,
oh wow,

695
00:39:36.760 --> 00:39:41.260
this delivery person who just brought me my food is a row.
Hanga right.
And um,

696
00:39:41.440 --> 00:39:44.650
they just do just living in a community center and with his family right down

697
00:39:44.651 --> 00:39:47.590
the street from me.
And they will love to tell you their story.

698
00:39:48.130 --> 00:39:52.840
They will love to share and you can anonymize your tool and app and be like,

699
00:39:52.841 --> 00:39:56.510
how could this be maybe not good for you?
And they go,
Oh yeah,

700
00:39:56.511 --> 00:39:58.600
you're right here when you ask this question right here.
Yeah.

701
00:39:58.601 --> 00:40:03.010
That [inaudible] know that they use this to get us right.
That's all it takes.

702
00:40:03.340 --> 00:40:06.040
It's just this weird paradigm shift and then all of a sudden you see a

703
00:40:06.041 --> 00:40:09.730
completely different world around you.
So,
um,
if you spend,

704
00:40:09.910 --> 00:40:14.910
I challenge you to spend 60 minutes on a little bit of search engine and a

705
00:40:14.921 --> 00:40:18.680
little bit of social media.
Hey,
hive mind,
does anyone know anyone who's from Imr?

706
00:40:18.700 --> 00:40:19.180
Right?

707
00:40:19.180 --> 00:40:23.680
You will immediately be face to face with someone who can help you take on the

708
00:40:23.681 --> 00:40:27.040
math challenge.
Right?
So,
um,
thank you.
And like,
you know,
at the end of the day,

709
00:40:27.041 --> 00:40:29.350
another thing is,
you know,
I'm directly affected myself.

710
00:40:29.470 --> 00:40:30.580
I'm part of a marginalized group.

711
00:40:30.850 --> 00:40:35.710
Hat's off to people who aren't because you could actually choose any issue and

712
00:40:35.711 --> 00:40:37.180
say like,
you know what I guess identify with this.

713
00:40:37.181 --> 00:40:39.250
I read it and then you say it bear,
that's my thing.

714
00:40:39.280 --> 00:40:42.580
I'm just adopting that thing and just do that.
Maybe just for a year,

715
00:40:42.610 --> 00:40:44.710
maybe for two.
Right.
Um,
you know,

716
00:40:44.711 --> 00:40:48.850
I told myself that I always say I have the luxury of having a lot of these

717
00:40:48.851 --> 00:40:52.750
issues directly at my doorstep.
I wouldn't do this.
Maybe if I could opt out,

718
00:40:52.780 --> 00:40:55.600
if I can sneak out the back door,
but there are people who'd be like,
Nah,

719
00:40:55.601 --> 00:40:58.510
I'd rather when you're doing,
you know,
you forgot us.
Right.
So,
um,

720
00:40:58.660 --> 00:41:00.520
so much easier when you're not directly affected.

721
00:41:00.521 --> 00:41:05.320
Just give up the next year or maybe three years in.
So,
um,
rotate,
cycle out,

722
00:41:05.350 --> 00:41:09.130
pick an issue,
jump in.
Uh,
I don't know if I would do it.

723
00:41:09.800 --> 00:41:13.000
I will never know if I would do it if I wasn't.
And thank you for caring.

724
00:41:13.420 --> 00:41:16.810
All right.
Um,
next question.
We have time person.

725
00:41:17.670 --> 00:41:20.610
<v 5>How would you approach the tradeoff between pushing for a stronger overall</v>

726
00:41:20.611 --> 00:41:22.020
security?
For example,

727
00:41:22.021 --> 00:41:26.280
browsers requiring https and breaking things that at risk users might depend.

728
00:41:26.281 --> 00:41:29.850
For example,
surfaces that aren't updated.
Both sides seem important.

729
00:41:30.920 --> 00:41:35.690
<v 0>Yes.
Okay.
So this is how do we balance pushing,</v>

730
00:41:35.750 --> 00:41:40.270
but we feel it's better for the people,
right?
This is better for you.
Come here,

731
00:41:40.280 --> 00:41:42.200
lineup take this shot is better for you,
right?

732
00:41:42.500 --> 00:41:47.200
Https everywhere or breaking a service that we know people depend on,
right?

733
00:41:47.210 --> 00:41:48.350
That might be like,
you know,

734
00:41:48.351 --> 00:41:51.890
there might be life saving aid behind a website that's not secure and when that

735
00:41:51.891 --> 00:41:53.480
site doesn't load in like chrome browser,

736
00:41:53.481 --> 00:41:57.080
which is the only browser that you know,
people use,
um,
that might be like,

737
00:41:57.081 --> 00:41:58.270
they can't,
they can't get that aid.

738
00:41:59.660 --> 00:42:02.180
That decision is a difficult one.

739
00:42:02.540 --> 00:42:07.460
But like any good rapid response person,
you're not making it on your own,
right?

740
00:42:07.750 --> 00:42:11.150
If I unfortunately have to make a decision to amputate somebody's arm or their

741
00:42:11.151 --> 00:42:13.820
leg or their finger on their hand,
I don't just be like,
yeah,

742
00:42:13.821 --> 00:42:17.300
this looks pretty bad.
Bite on this leather strap.
Right?
I can say,
listen,

743
00:42:17.301 --> 00:42:21.680
here's what's going on,
right.
Are stay with me.
Hold my hand.
I'm with you.
Right?

744
00:42:21.890 --> 00:42:23.090
This looks pretty bad.

745
00:42:23.480 --> 00:42:26.930
I think we might have to suture this or put a tourniquet here and that might

746
00:42:26.931 --> 00:42:30.920
mean you lose it,
but a,
we'll definitely get you alive outta here.

747
00:42:31.190 --> 00:42:35.750
They will tell you don't do it.
I'm a runner.
I love my legs,
right?

748
00:42:35.810 --> 00:42:40.430
Or they will say,
I want to get home to my boyfriend,
my girlfriend,

749
00:42:40.431 --> 00:42:42.710
my romantic partner.
Right.
Let's do this.

750
00:42:43.160 --> 00:42:47.630
So you don't make the decision on your own.
It's too heavy a decision,

751
00:42:48.110 --> 00:42:52.730
but elicit as many minds as you can.
And then you got to do it right.

752
00:42:52.790 --> 00:42:54.200
Cause a lot of this stuff is,

753
00:42:54.201 --> 00:42:57.530
I'm going to take a pen and stick it in your windpipe and just showed you can

754
00:42:57.531 --> 00:43:01.670
breathe.
You gotta make that decision.
You're the only one around.
Don't be afraid,

755
00:43:02.570 --> 00:43:07.570
step forward and take it and own it because you're trying to help and trying to

756
00:43:07.971 --> 00:43:09.740
help is a lot better than most people.

757
00:43:09.830 --> 00:43:12.800
So if it means that that side is blocked and messed up,

758
00:43:13.040 --> 00:43:15.260
people who are directly affected and marginalize,

759
00:43:15.350 --> 00:43:17.720
they'll lose that sight for a week,
that he'll build all,

760
00:43:17.721 --> 00:43:20.990
get together and read whatever they need to read and let's encrypt that thing

761
00:43:21.050 --> 00:43:24.980
and cert bought that thing and they'll have https the next day.
Someone will,

762
00:43:25.130 --> 00:43:29.630
they'll find a nerd,
I guarantee you.
Um,
so I hope that helps you.

763
00:43:29.631 --> 00:43:32.230
It's a great question.
I think we see a lot,

764
00:43:32.231 --> 00:43:34.060
I'm trying to figure out how to best formulate this question.

765
00:43:34.260 --> 00:43:37.660
This is a fundamental distrust of large institutions.

766
00:43:38.050 --> 00:43:42.130
Many of us working right institution and there are people who want to make

767
00:43:42.280 --> 00:43:46.240
change,
but we don't want to be perceived as bias toward one side or the other.

768
00:43:46.360 --> 00:43:49.330
And then there are people who are doing great work on the ground to try and make

769
00:43:49.331 --> 00:43:50.380
this change.
How do we,

770
00:43:50.680 --> 00:43:55.360
how do we engage in a way that can still enable trust with other people as

771
00:43:55.450 --> 00:43:57.970
people who are part of a large institution?
Um,

772
00:43:57.971 --> 00:44:01.090
and then also how do you get people to trust you as,

773
00:44:01.600 --> 00:44:04.840
is it because you're not necessarily affiliated with large institutions?

774
00:44:04.841 --> 00:44:09.390
Do you do purposeful things to,
um,
to try to mitigate that or do you find it,

775
00:44:09.391 --> 00:44:12.760
it's just like the nature of the information that you're bringing that gives you

776
00:44:12.761 --> 00:44:15.220
that,
that kind of credibility.
Okay.

777
00:44:15.221 --> 00:44:18.460
So this is a great question and it's about how do you deal with being associated

778
00:44:18.461 --> 00:44:21.760
with a large institution and the lack of cross that people have of those

779
00:44:21.761 --> 00:44:25.900
institutions,
especially when you're just trying to do one small good thing,

780
00:44:26.020 --> 00:44:30.700
right?
Is that a good way to,
okay,
so I'm part of a large institution,

781
00:44:30.701 --> 00:44:32.490
many of them,
some of these groups and names,

782
00:44:32.640 --> 00:44:35.610
maybe you've heard it for the first time,
but in my world they're huge.

783
00:44:35.770 --> 00:44:40.410
Ready to go map,
right?
So when I talked to me about OTF funding and I'm like,

784
00:44:40.411 --> 00:44:42.120
listen,
you're making this amazing app,

785
00:44:42.150 --> 00:44:44.830
this cryptography is awesome and you're working with a group that's like

786
00:44:44.850 --> 00:44:45.391
marginalized.

787
00:44:45.391 --> 00:44:49.350
This is great and you're doing it with three of your friends over bubble tea

788
00:44:49.351 --> 00:44:53.130
every other weekend.
You can get money to do this.
No strings attached.

789
00:44:53.131 --> 00:44:54.900
Like you can properly keep this going.

790
00:44:55.050 --> 00:44:58.740
Because a lot of the awesome tools that we use may point people to are barely

791
00:44:58.741 --> 00:44:59.574
holding it together.

792
00:44:59.940 --> 00:45:01.980
It's a person who was nights and weekends and you don't realize,

793
00:45:01.981 --> 00:45:04.260
but they just broke up with their partner and their landlords like,
Yo,

794
00:45:04.261 --> 00:45:04.821
what's up with the rent?

795
00:45:04.821 --> 00:45:08.790
Like it's so scary when you look at some of the tools that we point to what's

796
00:45:08.791 --> 00:45:09.990
actually running behind it.

797
00:45:10.230 --> 00:45:13.440
People who don't understand what it's like to work with project managers or with

798
00:45:13.441 --> 00:45:16.350
code that's always updated and has comments and commits and,

799
00:45:16.500 --> 00:45:19.140
and you can get blamed like any hour of the day with all these different

800
00:45:19.141 --> 00:45:22.260
developers touching it.
That's not how most of these tools are built.

801
00:45:22.470 --> 00:45:23.340
Most people would be,

802
00:45:23.760 --> 00:45:27.750
but just two seconds of your time on how they could work would blow it this

803
00:45:27.751 --> 00:45:31.320
thing like,
you know,
sky high and making them awesome.
Right?
Um,

804
00:45:31.980 --> 00:45:33.570
but they wouldn't trust me cause they'd be like,
Yo,

805
00:45:33.750 --> 00:45:37.400
I heard the State Department runs tour or something weird like that.
Right.
Or Yo,

806
00:45:37.410 --> 00:45:40.350
the feds make signal or something like that.
Right.
None of that's true,

807
00:45:40.351 --> 00:45:41.750
by the way.
Um,

808
00:45:42.180 --> 00:45:46.350
and what I do is how you build trust with anyone,
right?

809
00:45:46.650 --> 00:45:50.970
Your institution is always going to be hated because haters want to hit right,

810
00:45:51.090 --> 00:45:53.760
but people who need help,
they immediately want your help.

811
00:45:54.060 --> 00:45:55.680
Like no matter who you are,

812
00:45:55.890 --> 00:45:59.430
like let's say like a Neo Nazi is choking on a hotdog,
trust me,

813
00:45:59.460 --> 00:46:02.790
he wants behind it from me,
right?
Because they want to live.

814
00:46:02.791 --> 00:46:07.290
So preservation rules out above all things so you're not worried when it comes

815
00:46:07.291 --> 00:46:09.810
to the door,
the directly effected people.
If you're in the right place,

816
00:46:09.990 --> 00:46:14.370
that help is appreciated.
I guarantee you,
right?
Because it was needed yesterday.

817
00:46:14.640 --> 00:46:17.520
Now if you're in the place where it's a little bit yellow,
not red,

818
00:46:18.000 --> 00:46:19.560
like traffic site and like light,
right?

819
00:46:19.770 --> 00:46:24.330
Then you got to build trust and trust is earned,
not granted.

820
00:46:24.540 --> 00:46:26.490
So it begins by just being like,
listen,

821
00:46:26.910 --> 00:46:31.530
I worked for let's say Google or something,
right?
But I'm a person.

822
00:46:32.100 --> 00:46:36.390
I'm a human being and like a bank teller has a picture of their loved one facing

823
00:46:36.391 --> 00:46:39.240
you.
That's because they're trained.
That was keeps you alive.

824
00:46:39.540 --> 00:46:41.550
When you're humanized,
that's what keeps you alive.

825
00:46:41.670 --> 00:46:44.970
When we work with journalists and NGO workers and nonprofit people and we're

826
00:46:44.971 --> 00:46:47.370
like,
look,
this is how you survive imprisonment.

827
00:46:47.371 --> 00:46:51.030
This is how you survive kidnapping.
It's by being humanized,
right?

828
00:46:51.180 --> 00:46:53.670
It becomes difficult when you're,
uh,
when you're,
uh,

829
00:46:53.700 --> 00:46:56.580
people who are holding you see you as a person,
right?

830
00:46:56.670 --> 00:46:59.250
They know that song you like,
you told them,
oh,
whatever.

831
00:46:59.550 --> 00:47:02.430
They don't stop punching you,
but they pull back on those punches,
right?

832
00:47:02.730 --> 00:47:05.880
They don't stop giving you horrible food,
but maybe they give you,
you know,

833
00:47:05.881 --> 00:47:08.400
to two meals when no one's looking right.

834
00:47:08.970 --> 00:47:13.320
You build that trust slowly cause it's earned and it'll be zero the next,

835
00:47:13.321 --> 00:47:17.040
soon as you push too far.
Right?
And that is a long game.

836
00:47:17.280 --> 00:47:20.910
So when I work with a lot of communities are a lot of people where I'm not have

837
00:47:20.911 --> 00:47:24.960
this built in trust,
I just show up and I'm like,
listen,

838
00:47:24.961 --> 00:47:29.440
I'm unpacking my thing that you hate.
Yeah,
we did some bad stuff.
Yeah.

839
00:47:29.560 --> 00:47:33.760
That's horrible too.
But let me tell you about my auntie.
You know.
Hi Auntie.

840
00:47:33.790 --> 00:47:37.260
There's a little black panther that joke.
Okay.
So,
um,
uh,
but you could be like,
oh,

841
00:47:37.270 --> 00:47:41.890
let me tell you about my family.
Right?
And,
um,
that humanizes you.
You're like,
hey,

842
00:47:41.891 --> 00:47:46.750
let's eat.
Eating is key.
Everyone needs to eat.
Meet them where they eat,

843
00:47:47.140 --> 00:47:48.370
love their favorite food,

844
00:47:48.550 --> 00:47:50.980
bring them some more of that the next time it's a long game.

845
00:47:51.220 --> 00:47:53.200
Like I'm talking about months before you even start.

846
00:47:53.590 --> 00:47:55.720
Then all of a sudden they're like,
when they smile,

847
00:47:55.721 --> 00:47:57.250
when they see you and their eyes light up a little bit,

848
00:47:57.430 --> 00:48:00.220
almost like you're their friend,
but there's still suspicious.
That's your moment.

849
00:48:00.580 --> 00:48:04.630
That's when you start.
So we need to temper back that will and that wants,

850
00:48:04.690 --> 00:48:08.050
I want to do good right now.
If you really do,
you have to wait.

851
00:48:08.590 --> 00:48:10.330
You got to build that trust and understand that,

852
00:48:10.331 --> 00:48:13.220
that trust that when people see you coming and they're like [inaudible],

853
00:48:13.540 --> 00:48:18.430
that's real.
That's not for no reason.
They're rights.
Okay?

854
00:48:18.760 --> 00:48:22.930
But you're good.
And this is bigger than that,
right?
So hope that helps.

855
00:48:23.500 --> 00:48:27.640
Thank you,
Googlers for the work you do in this place.

856
00:48:27.970 --> 00:48:32.410
Delighting people and changing the future of technology in this world.
Right?

857
00:48:32.680 --> 00:48:37.330
The work you do outside as human beings whose families are so proud of you

858
00:48:37.510 --> 00:48:42.340
because of who signs your check.
Right.
Um,
understand the power that you wield.

859
00:48:42.850 --> 00:48:47.680
It's amazing.
And I'm so proud and humbled to be in front of you.
Right.
Okay.

860
00:48:47.710 --> 00:48:48.543
Thank you.
