1
00:00:05.810 --> 00:00:09.510
Welcome.
Thank you.
It's a pleasure to be here.
Yeah.
So,
uh,
so Dr Calvin,

2
00:00:09.511 --> 00:00:12.000
that's quite the,
that's quite the resume you have there.

3
00:00:12.001 --> 00:00:15.270
I'm so tell us a little bit more about your work at CSU Fullerton.

4
00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:18.510
So my primary job is really threefold.
Number one,

5
00:00:18.511 --> 00:00:22.460
I teach classes and nutrition performance,
strength conditioning.
Uh,

6
00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:25.380
we of course our laboratories.
So in the Center for sport performance,

7
00:00:25.381 --> 00:00:28.560
we've got about seven different laboratories,
a bomb mechanics,

8
00:00:28.561 --> 00:00:31.620
exercise physiology,
sports psychology,
um,

9
00:00:32.190 --> 00:00:35.340
human performance and motor control,
motor learning.

10
00:00:35.560 --> 00:00:39.630
And so really our job is to produce research that improves the human condition.

11
00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:43.110
We tend to focus on performance and sport performance.

12
00:00:43.111 --> 00:00:45.390
But really as the talk probably evolves here,

13
00:00:46.080 --> 00:00:50.140
you'll probably start to understand how I think that is a little bit more wide

14
00:00:50.141 --> 00:00:53.220
ranging than some people understand.
So if you in spruce sport performance,

15
00:00:53.221 --> 00:00:56.610
it's also a very good microcosm for understanding what improves that general

16
00:00:56.611 --> 00:00:58.920
human condition.
So with that being said,

17
00:00:58.921 --> 00:01:03.360
the third tier really of my job is to disseminate that information that we've

18
00:01:03.361 --> 00:01:06.960
learned in a lot of our laboratories,
in our studies,
to the people that use it.

19
00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:10.830
Whether that be the professional athletes see the UFC fighters or whether that

20
00:01:10.831 --> 00:01:11.730
be you folks at home.

21
00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:16.620
That's also why I do the podcast and why I'm here today and why I wrote the
book.

22
00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:20.940
Uh,
and if you notice the tone,
that book,
it's written for the general public.

23
00:01:20.941 --> 00:01:24.190
It's not written like I with my scientific papers and,

24
00:01:24.191 --> 00:01:26.940
and that's because we're trying to take the things we learned and on laboratory

25
00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:31.230
and put it into practice with the people that are gonna use it and benefit from

26
00:01:31.231 --> 00:01:34.020
it.
Got It.
And so how did you go from,
you know,

27
00:01:34.021 --> 00:01:38.640
leading a lab to working with Olympians and professional MMA fighters?

28
00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:41.340
Well,
that's really the same thing for me.
Um,

29
00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:45.570
they tend to be the participants and subjects in my studies because I'm trying

30
00:01:45.571 --> 00:01:48.600
to learn how muscle functions at the high level is specifically what we do in

31
00:01:48.601 --> 00:01:53.160
our lab is we learn what regulates how muscle grows,
shrinks,
dies and repairs.

32
00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:57.360
And it's important to understand that from the disease prevention treatment

33
00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:00.600
model.
But it's also important to understand the other side of the equation,

34
00:02:00.601 --> 00:02:03.510
which is let's look at the athletes who are the best in the world because now we

35
00:02:03.511 --> 00:02:04.710
understand what we're trying to get to.

36
00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:08.400
And so there's a pretty natural crossover there between these are the people I'm

37
00:02:08.401 --> 00:02:11.160
trying to study,
um,
learning information about them.

38
00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:14.670
Well then let's take the information I know and give it back to them and see if

39
00:02:14.671 --> 00:02:16.140
we could actually change performance.

40
00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:19.560
And so it's really circular works really well that way I get something out of
it,

41
00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:23.490
they get something out of it.
So it was a natural blend.
So let's for a second,

42
00:02:23.491 --> 00:02:25.110
assume that I'm a professional MMA fighter,

43
00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:27.240
which is having a likely cause terrible vision,

44
00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:29.400
tore my meniscus and no neck tattoos.

45
00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:32.550
And you work at Google and now we're at Google?
Probably not.
Yeah,
probably not.

46
00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:35.490
It's probably not a future career move,
but let's for a second as soon that.

47
00:02:35.491 --> 00:02:39.870
So would you work what I only work with you or would you be like part of a crew

48
00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:40.793
of a team?

49
00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:46.230
My role whenever I'm working with an athlete or my mom or anybody else is to do

50
00:02:47.701 --> 00:02:52.410
whatever I need to do to improve that person or to get them.

51
00:02:52.411 --> 00:02:55.980
And if that means you need to work with me directly and only me,
that's fine.

52
00:02:56.040 --> 00:02:59.890
If you need me to be the 43rd person on your team,
that's absolutely fine.

53
00:02:59.891 --> 00:03:04.000
My goal is not to have anyone ever do my system.
I don't have a system.

54
00:03:04.001 --> 00:03:08.860
My goal is to figure out what your problem is and fix it.
The easy example here,

55
00:03:08.861 --> 00:03:11.440
and I'm gonna show you how bad I understand programming,

56
00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:13.360
but this works very easy.

57
00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:16.990
If you had a problem with the some software that wasn't working appropriately

58
00:03:16.991 --> 00:03:20.230
you,
you can't just send the same piece of code to fix everything.

59
00:03:20.860 --> 00:03:24.280
It's easier to just look at the current code,
fix the one problem,

60
00:03:24.281 --> 00:03:26.470
and then go back.
That's all I'm trying to do.

61
00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:30.040
And we have a major fallacy of assuming everyone has that same problem.

62
00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:32.470
So the answer of your question is,

63
00:03:32.740 --> 00:03:37.030
I'm trying to find whatever role I can to help the person through their problem

64
00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:38.920
or to improve them.
If they don't have a problem.

65
00:03:39.370 --> 00:03:42.580
And so I've played every role you can imagine.
Some of the athletes I work with,

66
00:03:42.670 --> 00:03:45.940
I'm pretty high to that at the top and I'm determining what's going on.

67
00:03:46.270 --> 00:03:48.790
Some of them it's very low level stuff.
Uh,

68
00:03:49.270 --> 00:03:52.540
I'm always trying to encourage interaction with all their coaches,

69
00:03:52.960 --> 00:03:55.750
their physicians,
their staff members,
their agents,

70
00:03:55.751 --> 00:04:00.370
whatever I can to help them fix the problem or improve what they're trying to

71
00:04:00.371 --> 00:04:05.300
improve.
That's my circular goal.
It's about them,
not me.
God,

72
00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:08.770
I suppose like having that approach makes it so that working with so many smart

73
00:04:08.771 --> 00:04:11.800
folks,
like they're not stepping on one another's toes cause you're there for the

74
00:04:11.801 --> 00:04:13.090
individual now for yourself.

75
00:04:13.230 --> 00:04:16.810
That that's probably my single biggest piece of advice when working with an

76
00:04:16.811 --> 00:04:17.644
athlete.

77
00:04:18.010 --> 00:04:20.320
They have to understand that because they will see right through that as well.

78
00:04:20.950 --> 00:04:24.030
A lot of people want to work with professional athletes or any high level

79
00:04:24.370 --> 00:04:26.560
functioning person.
It doesn't matter if the professional athlete,

80
00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:31.630
they want to work with that person so that they can level up,
right.

81
00:04:31.630 --> 00:04:34.510
I want this person to succeed so that they can go around and tell the media that

82
00:04:34.720 --> 00:04:39.520
I got better because of Andy.
Right.
And an athlete will see right through that.

83
00:04:39.521 --> 00:04:42.070
And so you have to actually have that altruistic nature were saying,

84
00:04:42.071 --> 00:04:45.670
I'm just trying to help this person because I want to help that person.

85
00:04:46.720 --> 00:04:49.690
If you do it because you want to level up or get fame or fortune from it,

86
00:04:50.170 --> 00:04:51.010
it's not going to work.

87
00:04:51.011 --> 00:04:55.030
So my approach is that way because I'm really genuinely trying to help them.

88
00:04:56.020 --> 00:04:58.630
Most of the athletes that I've worked with have never mentioned me on their

89
00:04:58.631 --> 00:05:01.000
Twitter feed.
They've never posted about me.
And that's fine.

90
00:05:01.001 --> 00:05:03.880
That's not what I do at occasionally.
If they do it,
that's great.

91
00:05:03.881 --> 00:05:08.110
But the point is to help them get better.
Um,
and in a job like mine,

92
00:05:08.440 --> 00:05:11.080
working directly with the athletes is not actually part of my job.

93
00:05:11.950 --> 00:05:14.650
I have laboratories to run your heard of all the things I'm doing.

94
00:05:14.651 --> 00:05:16.750
I could classes to teach of other service to do.

95
00:05:17.450 --> 00:05:21.940
I'm on national boards and a scientific advisory panels and things like that.

96
00:05:22.480 --> 00:05:27.280
So when I work with them that that's a hobby for the most part that goes in that

97
00:05:27.281 --> 00:05:29.320
category in my brain anyways in terms of my workflow.

98
00:05:30.010 --> 00:05:31.120
And so I treat it like that,

99
00:05:31.150 --> 00:05:34.660
which means I'm willing to do this from the altruistic perspective of it gives

100
00:05:34.661 --> 00:05:37.310
me joy,
joy,
joy.
Uh,

101
00:05:37.660 --> 00:05:40.000
I enjoy it and I like to help people.

102
00:05:40.001 --> 00:05:41.860
So if I think I can offer somebody some help,
I will,

103
00:05:41.861 --> 00:05:45.460
but I'm not doing it for me cause I got,
I got names everywhere.
I got books,

104
00:05:45.461 --> 00:05:47.400
I got titles,
I got awards,
like lab.

105
00:05:47.401 --> 00:05:50.200
Last thing I need is the last thing I'm interested in.
Yeah.

106
00:05:50.260 --> 00:05:52.750
Something that really started about your work and I mentioned this to you before

107
00:05:52.751 --> 00:05:53.201
we walked in,

108
00:05:53.201 --> 00:05:57.140
was that it's both really refreshing but also really frustrating because I'm

109
00:05:57.141 --> 00:05:58.060
like,
am

110
00:05:58.060 --> 00:06:02.480
<v 1>I Quito?
Duane?
How'd you Kiddo?
Like,
which side is the best for me?
And I think,
um,</v>

111
00:06:02.510 --> 00:06:03.310
you know,
there's,

112
00:06:03.310 --> 00:06:07.520
there's this idea that it's a one size fits all mentality for both fitness and

113
00:06:07.521 --> 00:06:08.690
nutrition.
And I was right.

114
00:06:08.691 --> 00:06:11.120
If you could speak a little bit on Kinda like the nuance and kind of the way you

115
00:06:11.121 --> 00:06:13.900
would approach let's say four minute diet for uh,

116
00:06:14.060 --> 00:06:15.350
the high performing an Olympian.

117
00:06:16.120 --> 00:06:20.560
<v 0>I think the best way I can set this whole story up is a few years ago my</v>

118
00:06:20.561 --> 00:06:24.370
students walked into my classroom on the last day before the final and told me

119
00:06:24.371 --> 00:06:27.550
that they weren't going to take the final that they just handed and they pulled

120
00:06:27.551 --> 00:06:31.480
out from their bag a big bag of diapers and they said,

121
00:06:31.840 --> 00:06:34.060
this is our answer for every question.
Because the answer is always,

122
00:06:34.061 --> 00:06:38.970
it just depends.
Right?
That's,

123
00:06:38.980 --> 00:06:41.260
that's pretty much time to lay down on the job there.
I know.
Yeah,

124
00:06:41.320 --> 00:06:42.560
give it a second.
But,

125
00:06:42.590 --> 00:06:45.400
but that's what you're referring to in terms of frustrating because that is

126
00:06:45.401 --> 00:06:49.360
always the answer.
Physiology is so complex.
And the reason,

127
00:06:49.480 --> 00:06:52.840
even if you had two or 200 people that had the same quote unquote problem,

128
00:06:53.800 --> 00:06:56.770
it may not have the same reason why the problems there.

129
00:06:56.950 --> 00:06:59.710
And so if you give them the same treatment,
it may or may not be effective.

130
00:07:00.100 --> 00:07:02.020
And so I never give people blanket statements.

131
00:07:02.021 --> 00:07:07.021
I will use any tool to fix a job and oftentimes you have innumerable tools that

132
00:07:08.021 --> 00:07:11.740
could fix it and you have to go to your next level of thinking and logic to

133
00:07:11.741 --> 00:07:14.200
figure out which one do I choose because a thousand of them could.

134
00:07:14.350 --> 00:07:18.190
I mean example up here,
I've got two different water bottles up here,

135
00:07:18.430 --> 00:07:20.830
but not identical.
And if my problem was hydration,

136
00:07:21.220 --> 00:07:24.340
there's pros and cons to both approaches here,
right?

137
00:07:24.341 --> 00:07:25.930
And so I'm not trying to just say,
all right,

138
00:07:25.931 --> 00:07:28.150
everyone drink this because it's better.
Everyone drink this,

139
00:07:28.151 --> 00:07:29.560
don't drink this because it's worse.

140
00:07:29.920 --> 00:07:31.600
I want to look through every piece of evidence,

141
00:07:31.601 --> 00:07:33.400
what all possible could be going on here,

142
00:07:33.401 --> 00:07:37.210
what all sponsorable going on here and understand the pros and cons of

143
00:07:37.211 --> 00:07:38.740
implementing that and for my solution.

144
00:07:38.741 --> 00:07:41.560
And that's always what's going through my brain there.
We'll get to this,

145
00:07:41.561 --> 00:07:45.130
I'm sure in a second,
but there's no free passes in physiology.

146
00:07:46.120 --> 00:07:50.410
Everything does something and so you have to consider both the potential help

147
00:07:50.470 --> 00:07:53.500
and the potential consequence of anything you implement,

148
00:07:53.501 --> 00:07:56.380
whether that's food or they're a supplement.
Whether it's a sleep thing,

149
00:07:56.381 --> 00:07:58.780
it's technology of course this is what the book is about.

150
00:07:58.870 --> 00:08:01.600
There are pros and cons to everything.
Everything has an effect.

151
00:08:02.020 --> 00:08:05.020
And now when you start putting that into a system like physiology that is so

152
00:08:05.021 --> 00:08:09.070
complex,
you have to understand when you turn a switch,
it doesn't go on and off.

153
00:08:09.910 --> 00:08:11.710
It does a bunch of different things in physiology.

154
00:08:11.711 --> 00:08:14.710
So the game board is constantly moving.
When you adjust one piece,

155
00:08:14.711 --> 00:08:17.290
it doesn't just do one thing,
it adjust a thousand other things,

156
00:08:17.291 --> 00:08:21.040
millions of other things really.
And so you have to factor all that stuff in.

157
00:08:21.041 --> 00:08:26.041
And at the end of the day you're guessing at anyone that says anything different

158
00:08:26.141 --> 00:08:31.000
in,
in mechanical biology or,
or perhaps the software stuff.
You have a very,

159
00:08:31.240 --> 00:08:33.880
math is a very clear,
you do this,
it turns into that.

160
00:08:34.090 --> 00:08:38.740
Physiology does not work like that.
It is way too complex.
It's biology,

161
00:08:38.810 --> 00:08:41.470
it's two moving,
right?
Um,
the understanding or,

162
00:08:41.980 --> 00:08:45.970
or clarity of truth in biological or medicine is really,

163
00:08:45.971 --> 00:08:49.780
really difficult to get to.
And so you have to have that humility when you,

164
00:08:49.990 --> 00:08:51.970
when you treat people,
when you work with athletes,

165
00:08:51.971 --> 00:08:55.740
understanding I think this how it's going to work based on my experience and the

166
00:08:55.741 --> 00:08:58.890
evidence and everything else had been through.
But at the end of the day,

167
00:08:58.891 --> 00:09:01.230
you don't know.
You're just guessing.

168
00:09:01.770 --> 00:09:04.260
So what would be an example of like up at that trade off of like,

169
00:09:04.261 --> 00:09:08.130
let's say the example I've heard you use before it was like vitamin C.
Yeah.
Yes.

170
00:09:08.490 --> 00:09:11.510
So can you share a little bit about that?
The counterbalance of,
you know,

171
00:09:11.511 --> 00:09:14.370
taken in vitamin C as a supplement?
Well,
I mean,
I'll,
I'll use,

172
00:09:14.400 --> 00:09:15.233
I'll make an easier one.

173
00:09:16.950 --> 00:09:21.930
Vitamins and minerals are the easy go to because if you just take vitamin C

174
00:09:21.990 --> 00:09:23.460
prophylactically,
so he just took it all day.

175
00:09:23.461 --> 00:09:26.100
Every that's consequences that it has extreme toxicity.

176
00:09:26.250 --> 00:09:30.120
The idea here is called a whore,
which means there's,

177
00:09:30.150 --> 00:09:33.420
there's a toxicity curve to everything.
And Water,
I'll give you,

178
00:09:33.930 --> 00:09:37.020
I'll go to here because then even easier example,
which sets the point better.

179
00:09:37.770 --> 00:09:40.680
How many of you would be willing to stop drinking water the rest of your life?

180
00:09:41.330 --> 00:09:44.730
Yeah.
Cool.
Right?
Not too many hands going up there.

181
00:09:44.731 --> 00:09:49.500
So you would all agree being very low and hydration as a problem,
right?

182
00:09:50.610 --> 00:09:53.250
And you've heard this a thousand times,
Rick,
more water's better for you,
right?

183
00:09:54.210 --> 00:09:57.540
Do you all realize that if you drink enough water that will kill you?

184
00:09:58.620 --> 00:09:59.310
<v 2>Okay?</v>

185
00:09:59.310 --> 00:10:02.250
<v 0>Like you,
you all know this,
right?
There's a toxicity curve with water.</v>

186
00:10:02.370 --> 00:10:07.010
The most inner thing on the planet
has it.
Toxicity curve.

187
00:10:07.070 --> 00:10:11.320
If you drink too much of it,
you get what's called hyponatremia.
Alright?
The,

188
00:10:11.480 --> 00:10:13.610
the sodium potassium pumps.

189
00:10:13.611 --> 00:10:16.970
The things are the reasons why you have an electrical gradient between the

190
00:10:16.971 --> 00:10:19.400
muscles that cause contraction becomes diluted.

191
00:10:19.520 --> 00:10:21.440
Nothing pumps the heart stops pumping,
right?

192
00:10:22.850 --> 00:10:26.930
There's a toxicity curve to water.
Hmm.
I'll use an easier one.

193
00:10:27.380 --> 00:10:31.070
How many of you are willing to go 15 minutes without oxygen?

194
00:10:31.610 --> 00:10:32.443
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

195
00:10:32.980 --> 00:10:35.050
<v 0>Is that what you also do?</v>

196
00:10:35.051 --> 00:10:39.310
You also realize oxygen is probably the most toxic thing in the plant.

197
00:10:39.311 --> 00:10:42.580
Like this is rust,
right?
This is a oxidize.
This is the problem here.

198
00:10:42.970 --> 00:10:47.260
So vitamin C is no different.
Pick your mineral.
Um,
iron is a big one in men.

199
00:10:47.920 --> 00:10:51.400
Sometimes men have too much iron.
Women have the same problem.

200
00:10:51.401 --> 00:10:54.850
If you just give people prophylactic iron,
especially women,

201
00:10:54.851 --> 00:10:56.920
this is a common new Lucy because the menstrual cycle,

202
00:10:57.400 --> 00:11:00.040
we'll just give women more iron will fantastic.

203
00:11:00.041 --> 00:11:04.630
That causes all kinds of oxidative problems.
It causes all kinds of damage.
DNA,

204
00:11:05.020 --> 00:11:07.780
there's a ton of issues with that if you're giving them too much.

205
00:11:09.010 --> 00:11:11.710
So you can't just give people things.
There's,
this is what I said a minute ago.

206
00:11:11.711 --> 00:11:16.210
There are no free passes and physiology.
Nothing is good.
Nothing you'd look,

207
00:11:16.420 --> 00:11:20.560
you have to stop thinking about molecules and personifying them.

208
00:11:21.340 --> 00:11:24.310
Like there's no little evil body and a water molecule is like,
yes,

209
00:11:24.311 --> 00:11:26.980
let me get the human.
Yeah,
I will get it right.

210
00:11:27.270 --> 00:11:30.010
I just want to help people write that.
Yeah.
Movie inside,

211
00:11:30.580 --> 00:11:34.720
inside out or whatever it was.
Yeah.
But yeah,
the molecules are not people.

212
00:11:34.721 --> 00:11:38.650
A piece of water doesn't give,
um,
almost set a different word.

213
00:11:38.810 --> 00:11:42.640
It doesn't care if you're happy or sad or anything like that.

214
00:11:42.641 --> 00:11:46.090
Vitamin C is not toxic for you.
Uh,
you pick the worst,

215
00:11:46.091 --> 00:11:48.310
most toxic thing in the planet.
It doesn't have a personality.

216
00:11:48.311 --> 00:11:52.360
It doesn't care if it's sugar.
Yes.
Sugar like sugar doesn't hate you.

217
00:11:53.200 --> 00:11:55.810
None of these things.
It's always about hormesis wears it on the curve.

218
00:11:55.840 --> 00:12:00.280
And the crazy thing is pick any of these vitamins,
minerals,
or any,

219
00:12:01.030 --> 00:12:06.010
uh,
pharmacologically developed item at some point.

220
00:12:06.011 --> 00:12:10.150
It could save your life.
It could be the thing that changes how you feel.

221
00:12:10.840 --> 00:12:15.160
It could also be the Senate thing that kills you or makes you feel worse,
right?

222
00:12:15.161 --> 00:12:18.090
If you go further,
if it kills you.
So this is what I mean with all,

223
00:12:18.091 --> 00:12:20.440
all those things you have to understand where you're at in that curve.

224
00:12:20.441 --> 00:12:22.930
And a large part of it is you can get blood work done.

225
00:12:22.931 --> 00:12:26.410
But that's very crude measure really.

226
00:12:26.411 --> 00:12:31.180
It's about understanding how you feel because your body will tell you things and

227
00:12:31.181 --> 00:12:35.200
it turns out nature's figured out a lot of this form yet how hermetic curve

228
00:12:35.201 --> 00:12:38.830
pretty well
the amount of minerals,
for example,

229
00:12:38.831 --> 00:12:43.180
vitamin C that you can get through nature are generally fine.

230
00:12:43.270 --> 00:12:47.530
Hardly any of you are likely to be at a pass the hermetic curve where you're

231
00:12:47.531 --> 00:12:51.490
going to have physiological problems by consuming too many oranges.

232
00:12:52.360 --> 00:12:54.580
You're not going to get that much vitamin C because there's not that much

233
00:12:54.581 --> 00:12:55.750
vitamin C in the orange.
Right?

234
00:12:55.780 --> 00:12:59.950
It has a dosage that says this is probably going to be appropriate.
Well,

235
00:12:59.951 --> 00:13:01.360
you can get into a problem though,

236
00:13:01.960 --> 00:13:06.850
is taking things at dosages that are way higher than that than normal and in

237
00:13:06.851 --> 00:13:10.240
nature,
so super concentrated,
exogenous things like a pill.

238
00:13:10.900 --> 00:13:13.510
Right now you can get grams of vitamin C at a time.

239
00:13:13.990 --> 00:13:16.330
This is something you would have never gotten in the natural world and you have

240
00:13:16.331 --> 00:13:19.870
to be careful here of not making the natural fallacy.
Right,
which is it?

241
00:13:19.871 --> 00:13:21.670
Just things just because things are this way in nature,

242
00:13:21.671 --> 00:13:23.350
that means it's good that that's not true,

243
00:13:24.190 --> 00:13:28.180
but it is fairly reasonable in this context is saved that the sugar would be the

244
00:13:28.181 --> 00:13:29.830
same thing and we can certainly dive into that.

245
00:13:30.580 --> 00:13:35.170
It's not the fact that there's too much sugar and a carrot,
right?

246
00:13:35.171 --> 00:13:39.550
It's the fact that the way that people often consume sugar now it's in extremely

247
00:13:39.551 --> 00:13:41.320
concentrated forms that would have not,

248
00:13:41.380 --> 00:13:45.070
you would've had eat four bundles of carrots to get that much sugar or a beat

249
00:13:45.071 --> 00:13:46.180
for that,
for that matter too.

250
00:13:46.600 --> 00:13:50.230
So that's really the issue with all those things is we're not consuming those

251
00:13:50.231 --> 00:13:53.440
things are we are consuming those things in concentrations or dosages that,

252
00:13:53.500 --> 00:13:56.610
that our physiology is not really prepared for it.
So then,
um,

253
00:13:56.690 --> 00:13:58.300
to bring him back here,
back to the local level,

254
00:13:58.301 --> 00:14:01.390
then how can we take that information and apply it to like our day to day here

255
00:14:01.391 --> 00:14:04.790
at Google?
Um,
is it like,
is there like a best practice?

256
00:14:04.860 --> 00:14:09.160
You just like adjust your eating based on what the bacteria is out there is a

257
00:14:09.161 --> 00:14:13.840
best practice and it's all laid out right here.
Nice.
Just kidding.

258
00:14:14.470 --> 00:14:18.390
I'm not really,
but that's,
that's really what I'm talking about.
The,
the,

259
00:14:18.820 --> 00:14:23.560
the best practice number one is to treat the problem,

260
00:14:24.790 --> 00:14:29.350
not the symptom.
That's the issue.
So for example,

261
00:14:29.351 --> 00:14:31.990
if we'll just keep writing vitamin C so you brought it up.

262
00:14:32.770 --> 00:14:36.520
Why do people generally take vitamin C prophylactically?
Uh,
they feel sick.

263
00:14:36.521 --> 00:14:40.870
They're about to get sick.
Perfect,
right?
If you're taking that all the time,

264
00:14:40.871 --> 00:14:43.250
because every two or three weeks you feel like you're getting sick or you are

265
00:14:43.251 --> 00:14:46.990
getting sick,
that will cover up the symptom may even fix it.

266
00:14:46.991 --> 00:14:51.100
But what's the problem?
Something in your lifestyle or diet,

267
00:14:51.260 --> 00:14:55.730
nutrition or sleep is wrong.
That's why you keep getting sick.

268
00:14:56.240 --> 00:14:57.980
So you need to fix that problem.

269
00:14:58.010 --> 00:15:00.320
Now you can take the vitamin C once or twice or something.

270
00:15:00.560 --> 00:15:04.040
When you've got a crazy month and you've got to get this project or your over,

271
00:15:04.240 --> 00:15:04.760
all right?
Fine.

272
00:15:04.760 --> 00:15:09.760
But you have to realize that is the symptom that your body is trying to tell you

273
00:15:10.580 --> 00:15:11.630
you're doing something wrong.

274
00:15:12.650 --> 00:15:16.790
So some point you have to got to go back and fix the problem,
right?

275
00:15:16.791 --> 00:15:20.060
And that could be a whole bunch of things.
It's terribly boring,

276
00:15:21.080 --> 00:15:24.680
but I generally will apply the same problem or the solution for that problem to

277
00:15:24.681 --> 00:15:25.514
everyone.

278
00:15:25.670 --> 00:15:29.120
You're probably not sleeping well and consistently you're probably not eating

279
00:15:29.121 --> 00:15:32.270
enough high quality food.
You're probably eating too much low quality things.

280
00:15:32.271 --> 00:15:34.130
And you're probably not getting enough physical exercise,

281
00:15:34.640 --> 00:15:38.390
like most boring talk ever.
Right?
It turns out it's really,
really true.

282
00:15:38.391 --> 00:15:40.700
That's why we say it,
right?
Cliches are there for a reason.

283
00:15:40.840 --> 00:15:43.130
What stereotypes are there for a reason?
They're generally pretty true.

284
00:15:43.131 --> 00:15:45.920
Most of the time I got the chair over there.

285
00:15:46.100 --> 00:15:48.470
They're pretty accurate at the general,
very general love,
right?

286
00:15:48.830 --> 00:15:51.080
But that's what they're there for though.
We're trying to generalize.

287
00:15:51.170 --> 00:15:52.370
We're trying to give big,

288
00:15:52.371 --> 00:15:55.100
sweeping recommendations for everybody and it turns out those are the sweeping

289
00:15:55.101 --> 00:15:58.970
recommendations that work really well.
So we'll get into this concept right now.

290
00:15:58.971 --> 00:15:59.804
I guess.

291
00:16:00.350 --> 00:16:04.070
I think the easiest way I can explain this is you on two ends here.

292
00:16:04.670 --> 00:16:08.570
Over here you have optimization and this is something actually very applicable

293
00:16:08.571 --> 00:16:12.140
to all of you.
And over here is adaptation.

294
00:16:12.830 --> 00:16:14.900
So one of the things you have to realize about physiology,

295
00:16:14.901 --> 00:16:19.810
when you're optimizing,
you're not adapting all right?

296
00:16:19.820 --> 00:16:21.320
Or you can think of it as your super adapting.

297
00:16:21.860 --> 00:16:24.980
So if you're walking around at all times optimizing,

298
00:16:26.450 --> 00:16:30.650
you're actually causing the system to be more reliant upon that optimization.

299
00:16:31.550 --> 00:16:35.870
I'll give you an example.
The easy one I can pick on here is caffeine.

300
00:16:36.890 --> 00:16:40.130
So how many of you out there are willing to,
we're in the trust circle here.

301
00:16:40.160 --> 00:16:42.560
Don't worry,
I'm only judging everything you're doing right now.

302
00:16:43.400 --> 00:16:46.140
How many of you are willing to acknowledge that,
um,

303
00:16:46.430 --> 00:16:50.060
your a daily consumer of caffeine.
I like to party,

304
00:16:50.780 --> 00:16:53.660
I like to party virtually every hand goes up,
right?

305
00:16:54.890 --> 00:16:59.890
How many of you think your day is significantly enhanced or improved by that

306
00:16:59.991 --> 00:17:04.560
caffeine?
How many of you will keep going one step further?

307
00:17:04.860 --> 00:17:08.790
Are actually willing to admit that if you were to not get that caffeine dose in

308
00:17:08.791 --> 00:17:09.624
the morning,

309
00:17:09.930 --> 00:17:14.460
your productivity or some other function you see as positive would would be

310
00:17:14.461 --> 00:17:17.100
compromised,
right?

311
00:17:17.820 --> 00:17:22.020
So what happens with caffeine over time to your ability for its effectiveness

312
00:17:22.021 --> 00:17:24.510
over time diminishes?

313
00:17:24.780 --> 00:17:27.540
So you're optimizing by taking that cap and I'm not against caffeine.

314
00:17:27.570 --> 00:17:29.250
I'm going to go against us entirely in a second.

315
00:17:29.550 --> 00:17:32.040
I just picked this one because it's a very easy one that I knew all.

316
00:17:32.400 --> 00:17:35.700
All your hands would go up,
right?
I like,
I get it.
I'm a full time scientist.

317
00:17:35.701 --> 00:17:39.210
I run laboratories.
I teach four classes semester.
I write books.

318
00:17:39.211 --> 00:17:42.570
I do things like this.
I don't have any time either,
right?
I work with athletes.

319
00:17:43.110 --> 00:17:44.880
We're all in that same time crunch.

320
00:17:44.881 --> 00:17:48.660
I truly believe most people work about equally hard,
right?

321
00:17:48.690 --> 00:17:52.380
None of have any free time,
so you're constantly optimizing.

322
00:17:52.620 --> 00:17:56.310
You're doing what makes you feel the best right now because you've got to get

323
00:17:56.311 --> 00:17:56.880
this thing done,

324
00:17:56.880 --> 00:18:00.720
but then what happens it another project comes up and then another project comes

325
00:18:00.721 --> 00:18:03.870
and you end up in this constantly optimizing everything,
right?

326
00:18:04.110 --> 00:18:05.550
I'm taking my new tropic,

327
00:18:05.790 --> 00:18:10.740
I'm taking my other vitamin C pills.
I don't get sick,
right?

328
00:18:10.741 --> 00:18:13.470
I won't fix the lifestyle stuff.
I'll optimize everything right now.

329
00:18:13.890 --> 00:18:16.500
I'll take all the caffeine I can to get through this project,
right?

330
00:18:16.740 --> 00:18:19.860
But then I need more and more and more and then eventually what happens?
Boom.

331
00:18:21.000 --> 00:18:22.020
You blow it a pieces,
right?

332
00:18:22.050 --> 00:18:26.070
Physiology shuts down because it became so reliant on the technology.

333
00:18:26.220 --> 00:18:29.430
What happens if you stop taking that caffeine

334
00:18:31.940 --> 00:18:32.773
<v 2>headache,</v>

335
00:18:33.450 --> 00:18:37.530
<v 0>withdraw symptoms,
right?
All of these problems happen and you're like,
oh my gosh,</v>

336
00:18:37.560 --> 00:18:42.150
I can't stop taking the caffeine because you chose optimization.

337
00:18:43.140 --> 00:18:46.430
Is that the same thing with diet?
Like like uh,
if I were,
you know,

338
00:18:46.450 --> 00:18:49.440
to be 100% Quito and then I couldn't get that type of food and had to switch to

339
00:18:49.441 --> 00:18:53.400
something else,
it would there be a similar reaction is similar idea.
But yeah,

340
00:18:53.401 --> 00:18:57.450
you've become,
well we would say is non resilient,
right?

341
00:18:57.480 --> 00:19:00.270
You don't want to put yourself in a position where you can't handle things.

342
00:19:00.271 --> 00:19:03.780
You want to have some grit.
So I actually think it's great when people say,

343
00:19:03.781 --> 00:19:06.360
hey look,
I know if I do these four or five things in the morning,

344
00:19:07.080 --> 00:19:10.200
I become extremely clear and productive.
That's good.

345
00:19:10.201 --> 00:19:11.730
I want you all to know those things.

346
00:19:12.900 --> 00:19:15.150
I just don't want you to choose those every single time.

347
00:19:16.410 --> 00:19:19.590
So in the book we talk about you have to engineer and manufacture suffering.

348
00:19:19.591 --> 00:19:24.591
Sometimes you have to choose the hard path sometimes and you do that so that

349
00:19:26.130 --> 00:19:30.300
this doesn't get slid too far to the right because then you end up optimizing so

350
00:19:30.301 --> 00:19:32.250
much that optimal doesn't work anymore.

351
00:19:32.251 --> 00:19:35.430
You've got to optimize more and it got optimize more and now we're no longer

352
00:19:35.431 --> 00:19:37.950
having an effect.
And what do you think's happening to the physiology?

353
00:19:39.420 --> 00:19:41.700
If you have to have caffeine to wake up in the morning,

354
00:19:43.080 --> 00:19:46.320
what do you think happens to those indogenous processes that are there to help

355
00:19:46.321 --> 00:19:47.154
you wake up?

356
00:19:49.310 --> 00:19:50.143
<v 2>They become dull,</v>

357
00:19:51.120 --> 00:19:54.820
<v 0>right?
The sensitized.
They go away and eventually years later,
months later,</v>

358
00:19:54.821 --> 00:19:57.250
weeks later for whatever happens to me,
this becomes a problem.

359
00:19:58.220 --> 00:20:01.240
And so the answer to your question,
what's the actionable step?

360
00:20:01.241 --> 00:20:03.010
What can we do here at Google is,
yeah,

361
00:20:03.011 --> 00:20:07.270
sometimes have caffeine or how of whatever you're looking for.
Again,
a caffeine,

362
00:20:07.271 --> 00:20:10.420
it's just the one to pick on,
but then sometimes say,
you know what?

363
00:20:10.900 --> 00:20:15.790
I'm going to perform today.
I'm going to execute.
I'm going to be focused today.

364
00:20:16.750 --> 00:20:17.650
Without that stuff,

365
00:20:18.190 --> 00:20:23.190
help the body learn to go back the other direction too so that it learns to do

366
00:20:23.201 --> 00:20:25.360
that.
So you don't have to have those things.

367
00:20:25.750 --> 00:20:29.980
You don't have to have 250 grams of fat a day just to not feel foggy headed.

368
00:20:31.390 --> 00:20:32.410
If that's a problem,

369
00:20:32.411 --> 00:20:36.430
you should learn to build in what's called metabolic flexibility.
All right,

370
00:20:36.431 --> 00:20:40.180
so I'll grant you.
Some people are probably very dominant on carbohydrate,

371
00:20:40.930 --> 00:20:41.763
overly dominant,

372
00:20:42.730 --> 00:20:45.310
but that doesn't mean you should become overly dominant fat Bernie either.

373
00:20:45.630 --> 00:20:46.980
That says the same thing,
but at the end,

374
00:20:47.020 --> 00:20:50.620
the spectrum I want people to be able to do,
but both go back and forth.

375
00:20:51.040 --> 00:20:53.710
So if you're in a situation where a lot of carbohydrates are available,

376
00:20:53.860 --> 00:20:56.550
you can consume them or you want to for a thousand he said,

377
00:20:56.560 --> 00:20:58.000
just want to have some carbohydrates.

378
00:20:58.810 --> 00:21:03.010
I want you to have the physiology to go through that and not blow up the next

379
00:21:03.010 --> 00:21:06.790
day or eight days later or fall asleep or whatever other silliness people say
it.

380
00:21:06.791 --> 00:21:08.260
Right?
Same thing with fat.

381
00:21:08.590 --> 00:21:11.170
I want you to also not have to go through your day without having to have

382
00:21:11.171 --> 00:21:14.140
carbohydrate.
I think that is also equally a problem.

383
00:21:14.141 --> 00:21:17.950
I don't think that it's very clear this is an issue,
right?
So your gut health,

384
00:21:18.370 --> 00:21:19.390
your brain function,

385
00:21:19.420 --> 00:21:23.140
your energy level should all have the resiliency to handle multiple different

386
00:21:23.141 --> 00:21:26.140
stimuli.
This is where we are going to be optimal.

387
00:21:26.410 --> 00:21:29.780
And the more time you can say pushing away from optimization,

388
00:21:29.781 --> 00:21:31.780
spending an adaptation,
the more things get better.

389
00:21:31.781 --> 00:21:36.100
You don't need to do those things as much.
All right,
so again,
I'm not saying,

390
00:21:36.310 --> 00:21:36.581
all right,

391
00:21:36.581 --> 00:21:39.970
let's throw away all the worst things is go back to just living on water and,

392
00:21:40.420 --> 00:21:44.920
and Broccoli and,
no,
I'm just saying sometimes choose suffering,

393
00:21:46.120 --> 00:21:50.020
sometimes choose optimization.
And if you can just think yourself and go,
boy,

394
00:21:50.021 --> 00:21:53.140
you know what?
I haven't chilled suffering in a long time,

395
00:21:53.170 --> 00:21:56.710
but then that's probably time to shoot some suffering.
I Dunno if that's weekly,

396
00:21:56.711 --> 00:21:59.570
monthly,
I don't know what it is.
It doesn't matter.
But just having that,

397
00:21:59.571 --> 00:22:01.960
and this actually where the last word in the book is consciousness.

398
00:22:02.470 --> 00:22:06.190
Just having that awareness to go,
oh yeah,

399
00:22:07.150 --> 00:22:07.570
all right,

400
00:22:07.570 --> 00:22:12.570
and maybe it's time that I sleep for 10 hours for five straight days.

401
00:22:14.170 --> 00:22:16.780
Right.
It's really interesting what people will choose to suffer with.

402
00:22:17.470 --> 00:22:19.360
Some people will choose to suffer through exercise,

403
00:22:19.361 --> 00:22:22.900
but they won't suffer through any hunger or they won't suffer through eating

404
00:22:22.901 --> 00:22:27.100
something.
They don't.
I don't like that.
Like what?
You ran 20 miles yesterday,

405
00:22:27.101 --> 00:22:30.040
but you won't eat something because you don't like the taste of it the last five

406
00:22:30.041 --> 00:22:31.900
seconds.
That's the craziest thing.

407
00:22:31.901 --> 00:22:34.930
Some people will work and sleep five hours a night for weeks on end.

408
00:22:35.580 --> 00:22:36.413
<v 2>Hmm.</v>

409
00:22:36.600 --> 00:22:38.760
<v 0>But they won't do the opposite in the spectrum,
which is okay,</v>

410
00:22:38.761 --> 00:22:41.760
choose five days in a row where you sleep for 10 hours.

411
00:22:43.320 --> 00:22:45.780
They won't choose that type of suffering because they don't like it.
The board,

412
00:22:45.781 --> 00:22:48.390
or I'm agitated and I can't get,
I can't sleep at night,

413
00:22:48.391 --> 00:22:50.970
so I'm going to pull my phone and go.
I'm like,
no,
no,
no,
no.
Put that away.

414
00:22:51.000 --> 00:22:54.120
That's your suffering is not checking your phone every two seconds.

415
00:22:55.070 --> 00:22:57.600
Whatever you're suffering happens to be.
Pick something that's hard.

416
00:22:57.750 --> 00:23:00.720
I just make sure and,
and I use these examples that caffeine,

417
00:23:00.721 --> 00:23:05.070
but I want really the goal of the book and the goal right here today is to help

418
00:23:05.071 --> 00:23:06.810
you think about other aspects of your life.

419
00:23:08.610 --> 00:23:11.390
Maybe that's paying attention to your wife more,
right?

420
00:23:11.430 --> 00:23:14.820
Maybe that's not reacting to somebody in traffic as much.

421
00:23:14.850 --> 00:23:17.400
Choose the optimization.
Choose what feels good.

422
00:23:17.401 --> 00:23:19.590
Choose what gets you fixed the fastest right now,

423
00:23:20.340 --> 00:23:23.070
but then sometimes choose what's going to be the longterm solution.

424
00:23:23.071 --> 00:23:25.740
And it's the same thing I talked about.
This is fixing the problem.

425
00:23:26.640 --> 00:23:29.850
First thing in the symptom.
The symptom is I woke up today exhausted,

426
00:23:30.540 --> 00:23:33.420
I got to get as much as stuff done.
The symptom is fatigue,

427
00:23:33.450 --> 00:23:35.910
but the problem was lifestyle.

428
00:23:38.370 --> 00:23:42.700
The problem is lifestyle.
So balance those two things.
Yeah.

429
00:23:42.830 --> 00:23:44.510
So they have noticed the line and um,

430
00:23:44.740 --> 00:23:47.450
this might come up a couple a couple of times before,
but it's,

431
00:23:47.451 --> 00:23:50.270
I feel that our peer group,
especially here,
you're not Google,
we're all,
you know,

432
00:23:50.271 --> 00:23:52.130
around the same age.
We do similar activities,

433
00:23:52.131 --> 00:23:55.490
but we're trying to optimize for too many things.
You know,
like,
uh,

434
00:23:55.640 --> 00:23:57.530
like in my own personal case,
like,
you know,

435
00:23:57.531 --> 00:24:01.610
I try to be ketogenic and also do Jujitsu and you know,
halfway through a role,

436
00:24:01.640 --> 00:24:04.190
I mean,
you practice the sport as well and like help it to the wrong.
Just like,

437
00:24:04.460 --> 00:24:06.800
yeah,
I'm not going for that triangle.
I'm dead man.
Like I'm like,

438
00:24:06.980 --> 00:24:09.590
I can't get anything else.
And so I had to switch back to like,
okay,

439
00:24:09.591 --> 00:24:10.820
like let's get more carbs and you go,

440
00:24:10.821 --> 00:24:14.180
let's get you a little bit more ready in full so that when you're rolling,

441
00:24:14.210 --> 00:24:16.310
like those colors are activated and you have that energy.

442
00:24:16.520 --> 00:24:18.050
But like I couldn't do both at the same time.

443
00:24:18.051 --> 00:24:19.910
And so I had to pick one or the other.
Yeah.

444
00:24:20.530 --> 00:24:23.510
And that's a very good example when you try to make changes.

445
00:24:24.100 --> 00:24:26.960
So sometimes you have to be realistic with expectations.
Right?

446
00:24:26.990 --> 00:24:29.990
Now sometimes it's pretty much all.
And that particular case,

447
00:24:29.991 --> 00:24:32.780
you had to understand what the true goal is.
Are you trying to get to Jitsu,

448
00:24:32.870 --> 00:24:36.520
veterans,
Jujitsu right now?
Are you trying to get Keto adaptive?
I,

449
00:24:36.530 --> 00:24:38.960
because sometimes those things are going to be antithetical,
right?

450
00:24:39.170 --> 00:24:42.770
You have to understand if you don't make that decision of what the true goal is,

451
00:24:42.771 --> 00:24:46.670
a right,
you'll never do the get to that change.
Because when things get hard,

452
00:24:46.671 --> 00:24:49.100
you're gonna start making the change and your decision.
Right?

453
00:24:49.101 --> 00:24:51.890
So the goal has to be,
I'm going to get keto adapted.

454
00:24:52.220 --> 00:24:54.520
That means if you're wanting to,
yeah,

455
00:24:54.560 --> 00:24:57.140
I will stay in with Quito and if that means you did some stuff for us right now,

456
00:24:57.141 --> 00:25:00.860
fine,
I have to do that because I have to recognize the gold is over here.

457
00:25:01.970 --> 00:25:06.170
Or if the goal is to be getting better at Jiu Jitsu for that week,
month block,

458
00:25:06.230 --> 00:25:08.680
whatever happens to me,
this is a strength conditioning programming one on one,

459
00:25:08.760 --> 00:25:09.593
right?
Right.

460
00:25:09.710 --> 00:25:14.420
Have a goal for the day,
week,
month,
quarter,

461
00:25:14.420 --> 00:25:18.230
year and then understand,
be true to that goal.
So when things start going wrong,

462
00:25:18.231 --> 00:25:20.030
you look back up the chain and go,
yeah,

463
00:25:20.031 --> 00:25:23.120
well the goal of this week was this and the goal this month was that therefore

464
00:25:23.480 --> 00:25:26.990
here's my decision and I understand what to optimize for and what to push

465
00:25:26.991 --> 00:25:31.700
towards adaptation.
So that,
that,
um,
that ability to,
to be,

466
00:25:31.701 --> 00:25:36.590
to change your eating style.
So would that also apply to like working out?

467
00:25:36.591 --> 00:25:39.200
Like,
is there a variability in straight the conditioning to that?

468
00:25:39.201 --> 00:25:41.820
You would recommend 100% there should be very,

469
00:25:41.821 --> 00:25:45.140
the ability with all of these things,
you should look at your lifestyle,

470
00:25:45.141 --> 00:25:47.900
whether that's you're tricking,
your nutrition,
your exercise programming stuff,

471
00:25:47.930 --> 00:25:51.620
and think,
when's the last time I did something different?

472
00:25:51.650 --> 00:25:52.820
You should think globally,
right?

473
00:25:52.821 --> 00:25:57.050
So how many of you think it'd be good to do the same workout every day the rest

474
00:25:57.051 --> 00:26:00.760
of your life?
I got eye rolls there,
right?

475
00:26:00.761 --> 00:26:02.320
Of course that doesn't make any sense.

476
00:26:02.380 --> 00:26:04.750
Then why do you think there's one eating style you should do the rest of your

477
00:26:04.751 --> 00:26:08.840
life?
That doesn't make any sense either,
right?

478
00:26:09.320 --> 00:26:11.300
So you shouldn't just be keyed all the rest of your life.

479
00:26:11.301 --> 00:26:13.130
You shouldn't be carbon heavy the rest of your life.

480
00:26:13.131 --> 00:26:15.230
You shouldn't do any of these things the rest of your life.

481
00:26:15.860 --> 00:26:18.830
You can't if you want,
but there's no real reason that you should hate one.

482
00:26:18.831 --> 00:26:23.300
There's one way to eat ever,
but yet there's a thousand ways exercise.

483
00:26:23.310 --> 00:26:26.690
It doesn't make any sense,
right?
If you start going back up the logic train,

484
00:26:26.691 --> 00:26:30.800
you start thinking,
what am I trying to do with the exercise,
right?

485
00:26:31.070 --> 00:26:31.641
And you have many,

486
00:26:31.641 --> 00:26:34.790
many of us have different goals including things like I'm trying to get

487
00:26:34.791 --> 00:26:37.460
healthier,
I'm trying to lose weight.
Right?
All right,
I want more energy.

488
00:26:37.860 --> 00:26:39.500
And when you think about what the goal is,

489
00:26:39.501 --> 00:26:42.200
that actually determines the outcome as opposed to working backwards,

490
00:26:42.201 --> 00:26:45.090
which is to say,
I'm going to do this,
this program.
Why?

491
00:26:45.120 --> 00:26:48.540
Because my friend did it and loved it.
That goes back to we said earlier,

492
00:26:48.541 --> 00:26:51.120
well your friend might have been doing it for a different reason or it's super

493
00:26:51.121 --> 00:26:52.290
popular for a different reason.

494
00:26:52.560 --> 00:26:55.440
You have to think about what are you trying to get at it?
And this is,

495
00:26:55.441 --> 00:26:58.050
I won't do this one right now because I'm sure none of you want to beat us

496
00:26:58.051 --> 00:27:00.420
honest,
but it generally,

497
00:27:00.421 --> 00:27:05.250
you've I'm sure heard the rule of three wise Wy why,
right?

498
00:27:05.580 --> 00:27:06.960
It's three to five.
But when you,

499
00:27:07.050 --> 00:27:11.280
when somebody comes at you with a problem in the terms of nutrition or diet and

500
00:27:11.281 --> 00:27:15.990
you say,
I want to get x,
y,
y,
why do you care about that?

501
00:27:16.410 --> 00:27:19.470
Why do you care about that?
Why do you assume if you did this,
it would do that?

502
00:27:19.471 --> 00:27:20.670
And that's always what it comes down to.

503
00:27:20.671 --> 00:27:22.650
There's almost always a broken assumption.

504
00:27:23.370 --> 00:27:25.780
Why are you assuming if you eat less carbohydrates,

505
00:27:25.781 --> 00:27:29.370
you're going to lose more fat?
Well,
it just makes sense.

506
00:27:30.480 --> 00:27:34.620
That's it.
You're gonna Change your whole lifestyle because of that.
Oh,

507
00:27:34.650 --> 00:27:37.260
well what do you really want to do?
I really just wanna lose fat.
Great.

508
00:27:37.500 --> 00:27:41.940
So if I give you a plan to lose fat,
would you be happy?
Yes or no?
Yes.

509
00:27:41.941 --> 00:27:45.120
And if he lost the fact,
would you be happiest or no?
Yes,
I would be great.

510
00:27:45.360 --> 00:27:48.330
Well then I'm going to use whatever tool I can to help you lose fat.

511
00:27:48.600 --> 00:27:52.170
You brought a solution,
you brought an option there,
which is a fine option.

512
00:27:52.770 --> 00:27:54.390
But I'm going to look at the rest of the things and say,

513
00:27:54.391 --> 00:27:56.850
that's not going to work in your lifestyle.
I know you got kids,

514
00:27:56.851 --> 00:27:58.710
I know you've got this thing going on.
This is not,

515
00:27:58.890 --> 00:28:00.960
this is not very unlikely to succeed for you.

516
00:28:00.960 --> 00:28:05.550
So can I offer you another option that I think is more likely to succeed that

517
00:28:05.551 --> 00:28:09.000
we'll get to that goal.
That's what I'm after.
That's what we're always doing.

518
00:28:09.001 --> 00:28:12.300
So with exercises,
the same thing.
What are we trying to do here?

519
00:28:12.870 --> 00:28:16.780
And I'm trying to,
well my mom had a osteoporosis so I don't,

520
00:28:16.781 --> 00:28:18.330
I want to make sure I don't have that.
Oh,
okay.

521
00:28:18.840 --> 00:28:22.700
Or my dad just had a heart attack and so I'm really thinking about longterm

522
00:28:22.740 --> 00:28:27.360
health or hey look,
it's summertime.
It's Venice.

523
00:28:27.450 --> 00:28:31.260
I need to get ready for the pop this shirt off.
Fine.
Like whatever happens to be,

524
00:28:31.261 --> 00:28:34.740
let's get to the honest answer.
And people are shocked cause I don't care.

525
00:28:34.741 --> 00:28:36.870
I actually don't think vanity is the worst thing ever here.

526
00:28:37.980 --> 00:28:41.070
If that drives you to exercise more.
Okay.
That that can be a problem.

527
00:28:41.370 --> 00:28:43.410
At the end of the horn is Curtis.
It's like anything else,
right?

528
00:28:43.950 --> 00:28:46.020
But for a lot of people find if that's what it takes,

529
00:28:46.250 --> 00:28:47.340
well then let's talk about that.

530
00:28:47.341 --> 00:28:50.520
And now we're going to work backwards to figure out what program or style of

531
00:28:50.521 --> 00:28:53.880
training you need to do to get that goal as opposed to just picking a style of

532
00:28:53.881 --> 00:28:55.800
training.
Like that doesn't make any sense at all.

533
00:28:56.040 --> 00:28:57.660
And then of course when the goal changes,

534
00:28:57.810 --> 00:29:01.050
now we're going to rotate training philosophies based on what the next goal is.

535
00:29:01.400 --> 00:29:02.900
And so speaking of training and like genetics,

536
00:29:02.910 --> 00:29:04.920
like how much of what you have is like fixed,

537
00:29:05.130 --> 00:29:07.390
like assuming again that I'd become,
you know,
you know,

538
00:29:07.470 --> 00:29:10.610
you know the best Mexican American UFC fighter ever.
Um,
you know,

539
00:29:10.770 --> 00:29:14.610
how much of that is limited by what I already have or did that complete change

540
00:29:14.611 --> 00:29:16.690
my bill or am I kind of just stuck as is.

541
00:29:16.800 --> 00:29:20.820
So we've actually ran a recent trial with some his leg as twins.

542
00:29:20.910 --> 00:29:22.560
So these are twins.
They had the exact same DNA,

543
00:29:22.590 --> 00:29:26.850
so they're clones and one of them had stopped exercising when he was about 18 or

544
00:29:26.851 --> 00:29:27.684
20 years old.

545
00:29:28.680 --> 00:29:31.230
And the other one I continued to exercise and at the time when we tested them,

546
00:29:31.231 --> 00:29:32.430
they're in their early fifties,

547
00:29:32.940 --> 00:29:37.530
so really 30 years of different exercise training and well,

548
00:29:37.560 --> 00:29:41.390
everything that you in your body is slightly different here.
Uh,

549
00:29:41.740 --> 00:29:46.690
generally at worst you're talking about 50,
50 genetics and lifestyle.

550
00:29:47.020 --> 00:29:48.700
Some of the markers more aggressive.

551
00:29:48.701 --> 00:29:53.140
Some of the things that we saw were closer to 80,
20 in favor of lifestyle,

552
00:29:53.750 --> 00:29:56.080
really not genetics.
Uh,

553
00:29:56.081 --> 00:29:59.890
the exposome is what some people refer to this I think,
not genetic.

554
00:30:00.010 --> 00:30:01.720
So it depends on what you're talking about.

555
00:30:01.990 --> 00:30:04.630
If you're talking about something like how tall you are,

556
00:30:05.560 --> 00:30:09.070
that's pretty much 100% genetic,
right?
There's not a lot we can do.
Sorry,

557
00:30:09.250 --> 00:30:13.150
sorry man.
But if you look at something like,
uh,

558
00:30:13.540 --> 00:30:16.490
your overall health or I'll,

559
00:30:16.491 --> 00:30:18.550
I'll pick a maybe more specific example.

560
00:30:18.551 --> 00:30:22.030
We took muscle biopsies and we analyze them for fiber type,
right?

561
00:30:22.031 --> 00:30:25.330
So most of you heard there's fast twitch muscle fibers is low to a tray.
Well,

562
00:30:25.331 --> 00:30:28.150
unlike what most people think,
there's tremendous plasticity within that.

563
00:30:28.151 --> 00:30:32.320
So you can swing back,
you can go from fast to slow,
slow to fast really quickly.

564
00:30:32.321 --> 00:30:36.610
We've seen changes in fiber type in the disorders,
two weeks,
uh,
11 days really.

565
00:30:37.330 --> 00:30:42.070
And in this particular case,
one of the twins was about 50,

566
00:30:42.071 --> 00:30:46.030
50,
fast twitch and slow twitch and the other one was about 90% slow twitch.

567
00:30:46.990 --> 00:30:51.940
So I really,
basically for things like again,
height,
you can't really change.

568
00:30:52.420 --> 00:30:54.400
But anything that has any plasticity to it,

569
00:30:54.640 --> 00:30:58.360
there really is no limit to how much it changes.
It only comes down to exposure.

570
00:30:59.010 --> 00:31:01.660
So the more often you do it,
the longer you have to do it.
For example,

571
00:31:01.661 --> 00:31:05.350
if I took these twins and I had another 100 years to keep them going,

572
00:31:05.380 --> 00:31:08.980
they would continue to change.
It's not a physiological limit,

573
00:31:08.981 --> 00:31:12.340
it's just the limit to exposure,
time and load,
right?

574
00:31:13.090 --> 00:31:18.090
And so you have unlimited ability to change virtually anything about you if you

575
00:31:18.461 --> 00:31:19.390
give it enough exposure.

576
00:31:19.540 --> 00:31:23.380
So that means you have to be patient and you have to do things often.

577
00:31:24.130 --> 00:31:24.941
If you're consistent,

578
00:31:24.941 --> 00:31:28.360
you do it often and you wait time Bateson basically anything about your body,

579
00:31:28.361 --> 00:31:31.150
your physique and especially things like muscle,

580
00:31:31.980 --> 00:31:36.070
it had virtually no limit to plasticity w within our lifestyle or within our

581
00:31:36.071 --> 00:31:40.690
lifetime at this stage.
So everything really can change.
Got It.

582
00:31:40.710 --> 00:31:41.800
And how,

583
00:31:41.830 --> 00:31:45.820
how related is that to like the idea of epigenetics that some fake turn off and

584
00:31:45.821 --> 00:31:48.240
on depending on what you do is that there's this,

585
00:31:48.280 --> 00:31:51.910
go back to the 20 example you just shared.
Yeah,
that is one example of that.

586
00:31:51.911 --> 00:31:53.590
So you have genes that you can't change.

587
00:31:53.591 --> 00:31:56.330
You can't change the DNA that you've inherited.
Uh,

588
00:31:56.350 --> 00:31:58.300
but we've been doing this for decades now.

589
00:31:58.570 --> 00:32:03.570
The idea that just because you have a gene doesn't mean that gene is going to be

590
00:32:03.821 --> 00:32:07.390
expressed if that gene is not expressed,
no proteins are built,

591
00:32:07.420 --> 00:32:08.990
no proteins are built,
nothing happens.

592
00:32:09.670 --> 00:32:13.000
So somebody that say that gets a bad drop because certainly people get better

593
00:32:13.001 --> 00:32:16.500
draws genetically and some get worse.
So for let's say,
Oh,

594
00:32:16.510 --> 00:32:18.970
give me an example myself.
Um,

595
00:32:19.000 --> 00:32:23.200
I've done a bunch of genetic testing and I have a lot of markers for obesity.

596
00:32:23.720 --> 00:32:27.760
And so if you calculate the rough numbers,
I have something like 15 or 16 x,

597
00:32:28.210 --> 00:32:29.140
the risk of obesity,

598
00:32:30.070 --> 00:32:33.130
and I'm not the best looking person you've ever seen with their shirt off over

599
00:32:33.131 --> 00:32:35.590
there and the beach,
but it's not too bad.
Right?

600
00:32:35.620 --> 00:32:39.470
Everyone else in my family is obese.
Everyone,
for most part,

601
00:32:40.940 --> 00:32:43.730
I have the same.
I have very bad genetics when it comes to those things.

602
00:32:43.731 --> 00:32:46.850
I have to work very hard in my exercise and nutrition.
It's not just natural.

603
00:32:46.851 --> 00:32:50.330
I wasn't born with a fast metabolism.
That's all garbage.
Right?

604
00:32:51.050 --> 00:32:55.760
I have the genetic markers that gave me every excuse to be obese,

605
00:32:56.840 --> 00:32:59.810
but if I don't match that with the lifestyle,

606
00:33:00.650 --> 00:33:02.690
those genes are never going to really matter that much.

607
00:33:03.710 --> 00:33:07.940
If though I gave my lifestyle a little bit,
it would take off.

608
00:33:08.750 --> 00:33:10.190
Some people get a lot,

609
00:33:10.191 --> 00:33:14.030
some people even have much higher on the the obesity thing than I,

610
00:33:14.240 --> 00:33:17.210
and they matched that.
Did they pretty well,
their lifestyle's pretty good,

611
00:33:17.211 --> 00:33:20.630
but that's enough to really send them off the edge.
Right.

612
00:33:20.631 --> 00:33:24.110
And so they have to work really hard and do everything to just kinda stay there.

613
00:33:24.260 --> 00:33:26.270
Some people are on the other end of that spectrum.

614
00:33:26.880 --> 00:33:28.400
It doesn't really matter what they do.

615
00:33:28.401 --> 00:33:29.980
They're not going to be in the surface level obese.

616
00:33:30.110 --> 00:33:33.620
But keep in mind a major misnomer here is skinny,

617
00:33:33.621 --> 00:33:37.460
is not healthy and obese is not unhealthy necessarily either.

618
00:33:38.120 --> 00:33:40.760
Adding more fat mass is generally never a good thing for your health.

619
00:33:40.940 --> 00:33:44.600
But just because you're not fat does not mean you're healthy.

620
00:33:44.840 --> 00:33:46.880
And we have tremendous data on this.
Uh,

621
00:33:46.970 --> 00:33:51.970
hundreds of thousands of people now in dozens of studies across laboratories

622
00:33:52.311 --> 00:33:56.330
across the world.
Some of the most significant predictors of mortality,

623
00:33:56.360 --> 00:33:59.660
so this is when you're going to die,
are things like leg strength.

624
00:34:00.770 --> 00:34:05.750
It's not obesity,
it's things like vo two Max.
It's not your cholesterol.

625
00:34:07.130 --> 00:34:09.620
So you could be somebody who is quote unquote skinny,

626
00:34:11.490 --> 00:34:12.360
have weak legs,

627
00:34:12.361 --> 00:34:16.530
have a low vo two Max and be at two to three times if not higher.

628
00:34:17.010 --> 00:34:19.710
The mortality risk of somebody who's a little bit overweight,

629
00:34:20.250 --> 00:34:22.980
but they have a reasonable vo two Max and a reasonable like strength because

630
00:34:22.981 --> 00:34:27.480
they're acting like if you want to talk about health,
that's what health means.

631
00:34:28.230 --> 00:34:30.870
So really depends on are you talking about aesthetics or health?

632
00:34:31.710 --> 00:34:33.180
But those are different conversations.

633
00:34:33.181 --> 00:34:36.360
Just because you're not fat as does not mean you're healthy.

634
00:34:37.050 --> 00:34:40.950
You could be right above that line of dime.
Got It.
And so speaking of lifestyle,

635
00:34:40.951 --> 00:34:42.780
you have this wonderful now that you either what you described,

636
00:34:42.781 --> 00:34:45.790
the differences and in terms of eating in between a cook,
oh yeah.

637
00:34:45.810 --> 00:34:49.920
Baker and a chef.
Uh,
I would love for you to,
to share a little bit about that.

638
00:34:51.360 --> 00:34:56.130
So like any analogy,
it's not perfect,
right?
But what I try to do is,

639
00:34:56.131 --> 00:34:57.620
as I mentioned,
it's a little bit of blended.

640
00:34:57.630 --> 00:35:00.660
The soft sciences and the hard sciences.
I'm a hard scientist,
right?

641
00:35:01.560 --> 00:35:03.060
It's quantitative versus qualitative.

642
00:35:03.061 --> 00:35:07.200
Everything in my world is quantitative biopsy.
You measure everything,
molecules.

643
00:35:07.201 --> 00:35:10.500
We measured signaling proteins,
genes,
things like that.
And there's no fudging,

644
00:35:10.501 --> 00:35:11.810
there's no look,
look,

645
00:35:11.850 --> 00:35:14.550
you look pretty good that that doesn't work in muscle physiology.

646
00:35:15.810 --> 00:35:17.580
But the soft sciences are more qualitative.
Right?

647
00:35:17.581 --> 00:35:21.540
And so what I try to do is when I'm speaking to a client,
an athlete,

648
00:35:21.541 --> 00:35:24.420
or even a student,
or even my parents,
are you right now,

649
00:35:24.600 --> 00:35:26.190
there's two conversations that go on in my head.

650
00:35:27.060 --> 00:35:29.250
The conversation number one is what's the information?

651
00:35:29.310 --> 00:35:30.540
What's the thing I'm trying to say?

652
00:35:30.990 --> 00:35:34.350
Conversation number two is what's the best way I need to say it to you

653
00:35:35.910 --> 00:35:38.250
to have the impact,
right?

654
00:35:38.280 --> 00:35:42.210
If I give you every piece of information I know in my head you can't execute,

655
00:35:42.330 --> 00:35:46.470
and it oftentimes that confuses you even more and makes you go,

656
00:35:47.070 --> 00:35:51.720
I'm out.
Like I just wanted one answer.
I would've started taking vitamin C.

657
00:35:51.750 --> 00:35:54.960
DO I do it?
Yes or no?
I'm out.

658
00:35:56.160 --> 00:36:00.510
So you have to have two conversations going to translate what I think I need to

659
00:36:00.511 --> 00:36:00.811
say to you.

660
00:36:00.811 --> 00:36:05.811
So my analogy that I make up with the Cook Baker and chef is my way of putting

661
00:36:06.121 --> 00:36:09.510
people in personality categories for one simple metric,
which is nutrition.

662
00:36:10.640 --> 00:36:12.930
And that helps me understand how I need to communicate with them.

663
00:36:13.560 --> 00:36:18.560
And it actually works really well because people fall into this cook Baker chef

664
00:36:19.261 --> 00:36:22.230
analogy in every aspect of their life.
But you may switch back.

665
00:36:22.231 --> 00:36:26.250
So when you go to work here in a second,
you might be a baker,

666
00:36:26.610 --> 00:36:28.650
but then with your own nutrition,
you might be a cook.

667
00:36:28.980 --> 00:36:32.730
So people aren't just a cook or a baker in all aspects of life.

668
00:36:32.760 --> 00:36:35.160
It changes depending on the rules.
So for example,
for me,

669
00:36:35.161 --> 00:36:38.940
and I'll get into what this cook Baker chef thing is a second for nutrition,

670
00:36:38.941 --> 00:36:43.230
I am definitely,
I cook,
but when it comes to my taxes,

671
00:36:44.060 --> 00:36:48.510
not like not the same way,
right?
When it comes to fixing my car,

672
00:36:49.260 --> 00:36:53.010
I'm totally a baker,
right?
I'm,
I'm following every instruction.
I'm not,

673
00:36:53.360 --> 00:36:56.490
I can feel here,
right?
This might go here.
It's just put that there.
Right.

674
00:36:56.880 --> 00:36:58.080
And so these analogy is,

675
00:36:58.081 --> 00:36:59.880
do any of you know the difference between cooking and baking?

676
00:37:00.750 --> 00:37:01.800
I started just gave you a hint.

677
00:37:04.810 --> 00:37:08.200
Baking is chemistry,
right?
Baking is extremely precise.

678
00:37:08.201 --> 00:37:11.530
You cannot do things in different orders.
When you bake,
you can't be like,
well,

679
00:37:11.531 --> 00:37:15.280
I'll just get the baking powder outs.
Tossa men like not going to work.

680
00:37:15.600 --> 00:37:18.010
Like was that baking soda or baking powder?
I camera.
Just throw one of them in.

681
00:37:18.040 --> 00:37:21.380
All right.
Put a little bit both not going to work on chemistry,
right?

682
00:37:21.381 --> 00:37:24.450
So the Yolo move,
just put in both.
See what happens.
Yeah,
exactly.
Right.

683
00:37:24.740 --> 00:37:29.260
Generational millennials.
It's what you do cooking.

684
00:37:29.500 --> 00:37:32.740
Is that though,
right?
Cooking as well.
Okay.
Yeah.
You just kind of get it hot.

685
00:37:32.741 --> 00:37:35.500
Put it in the pan.
Uh,
put a little bit of this,
a little bit of that in there.

686
00:37:35.501 --> 00:37:37.270
Well,
it doesn't really matter if you have it and you know not what?
Chaotic,

687
00:37:37.290 --> 00:37:39.880
that's it.
Not going to kill it.
It just kind of toss things around.
Right?

688
00:37:40.840 --> 00:37:44.740
So people process information the same way.
How many of you,
if I said,

689
00:37:44.741 --> 00:37:46.570
look for having me up here today,

690
00:37:47.140 --> 00:37:49.660
I'm going to actually go ahead and you offer you my services for free for the

691
00:37:49.661 --> 00:37:53.590
next 30 days.
I'll be your personal nutritionist next 30 days.

692
00:37:54.220 --> 00:37:56.410
No charge.
Uh,
how many of you have,
I said,
look,

693
00:37:56.440 --> 00:37:59.650
I will write you a specific program.
I'll tell you exactly what to eat,

694
00:37:59.651 --> 00:38:02.740
when to eat.
You have to weigh,
you have to buy a little scale,
you have to wait.

695
00:38:02.741 --> 00:38:04.840
Every single thing you eat,
you have to report it back to me.

696
00:38:04.841 --> 00:38:08.950
And if you fail one meal,
I'm out.
How many of you would love something like that?

697
00:38:11.810 --> 00:38:14.380
Right?
Huh?
How many of you were like,
what if I just,

698
00:38:14.410 --> 00:38:16.420
we met like once a week for 30 minutes or an hour.

699
00:38:16.450 --> 00:38:17.380
You could ask him a couple of questions.

700
00:38:17.381 --> 00:38:21.010
I gave you some concepts and then you went back.
How many of you would like that?

701
00:38:23.020 --> 00:38:26.200
Right?
You are a baker,

702
00:38:27.910 --> 00:38:28.840
your cooks.

703
00:38:30.070 --> 00:38:33.700
If if we worked together and now especially if you paid me,

704
00:38:33.730 --> 00:38:38.380
if you're paying me $1,000 a to do this and you wanted that kind of information

705
00:38:38.381 --> 00:38:40.990
at that level of detail and all I gave you was,

706
00:38:41.080 --> 00:38:45.790
well you don't just a little more protein,
the cubic pissed,
right?

707
00:38:46.440 --> 00:38:47.830
You're like you'd be freaking out.

708
00:38:47.831 --> 00:38:50.760
Like what's the great example I give all the time,
times my wife,

709
00:38:50.761 --> 00:38:52.210
cause she is a bake when it comes to food.

710
00:38:52.900 --> 00:38:56.590
So when I first started helping her years ago with an nutrition,
you know,

711
00:38:56.600 --> 00:38:58.330
I'd be like,
okay,
this is a little bit of,
um,

712
00:38:58.400 --> 00:39:00.940
little bit of a woman's walnuts today at lunch.
She'd be like,
well,

713
00:39:00.941 --> 00:39:04.870
well what do you mean like like eight almonds or walnuts 11.

714
00:39:04.871 --> 00:39:07.300
What are we talking about?
Cause she came,

715
00:39:07.301 --> 00:39:10.300
she's a baker it plus she came from that counting calorie thing.

716
00:39:10.301 --> 00:39:11.640
She came from all this and she wants,

717
00:39:11.650 --> 00:39:15.160
she gave her anxiety to not have that information.

718
00:39:17.170 --> 00:39:18.850
You,
if I gave you all that information,

719
00:39:18.851 --> 00:39:20.830
he would give you anxiety because you're like,
oh my God,

720
00:39:20.831 --> 00:39:23.440
it's controlling my life.
It's too much.

721
00:39:24.430 --> 00:39:28.270
So even though the answer to all of your nutritional problems,

722
00:39:28.271 --> 00:39:29.860
we'll just say is the exact same thing.

723
00:39:30.820 --> 00:39:33.400
I cannot communicate to you how I communicate to the rest of you.

724
00:39:34.120 --> 00:39:35.200
It's going to be ineffective.

725
00:39:36.130 --> 00:39:39.280
So I have to have that second conversation with says,
okay,

726
00:39:39.940 --> 00:39:43.060
how does she want to hear this information and what do I need to tell her?

727
00:39:43.061 --> 00:39:45.700
I can't give her too much.
I can't give her too little.

728
00:39:46.630 --> 00:39:48.220
There's a thing called Buyin,
right?

729
00:39:48.221 --> 00:39:51.370
You got to be convinced and excited it's going to work.
It's gotta be overload.

730
00:39:51.400 --> 00:39:54.640
And I got to make sure that I'm trying to line you up with buyin as well as

731
00:39:54.970 --> 00:39:56.590
feeling good about,
yeah,
no,

732
00:39:56.650 --> 00:39:59.710
I see why you gave me wellness because this was going on and they see why you

733
00:39:59.711 --> 00:40:03.330
added this because we are here.
Perfect.
That's going to fix my problems.

734
00:40:04.180 --> 00:40:05.710
You might not care about that.
You're like,
look,

735
00:40:05.711 --> 00:40:08.710
I just wanna be a little bit less fat.
Give me some ideas.
What am I doing wrong?

736
00:40:09.550 --> 00:40:11.680
Cool.
And you were really empowered by that.

737
00:40:11.681 --> 00:40:14.950
You're excited by that versus added anxiety to your plan.
Right?

738
00:40:15.670 --> 00:40:20.080
So bakers need to be given very specific instructions.
Even here's the secret.

739
00:40:21.730 --> 00:40:26.380
Even if those instructions aren't perfectly right,
it doesn't really matter.

740
00:40:26.410 --> 00:40:31.410
I don't know if you need to be on 180 grams of carbohydrate or 280 but if I told

741
00:40:32.771 --> 00:40:36.040
you that you wouldn't be happy.
But if I walked down like,
Oh yeah,
no,

742
00:40:36.041 --> 00:40:40.370
you need to be at one 75 exactly.
Don't go to one 90 be at one 75 you went,

743
00:40:40.390 --> 00:40:41.690
oh sweet,
great.
And I turned around.

744
00:40:43.990 --> 00:40:47.590
You would rather hear that the not hear that because you have a plan.

745
00:40:48.340 --> 00:40:50.950
Some of you are planners,
right?
Some of you liked that.
The detail,

746
00:40:50.951 --> 00:40:54.310
and we can adjust the plan as we go.
So you can a week come back to me and go,

747
00:40:54.311 --> 00:40:58.760
look,
I'm feeling boom,
boom,
boom,
boom,
boom.
Oh,
okay,
let's take those carbs.

748
00:40:58.780 --> 00:41:00.820
Let's go up to two 20 and see what happens.
Okay,
great.

749
00:41:01.210 --> 00:41:05.680
You just like having a plan,
right?
Some of you don't want,
that's too much.

750
00:41:05.700 --> 00:41:07.240
You can take over your life,
you're not going to execute it.

751
00:41:07.510 --> 00:41:09.280
And the number one thing with diet nutrition,

752
00:41:09.940 --> 00:41:13.660
the number one thing to actually changing something is adherence.

753
00:41:15.130 --> 00:41:19.030
If nobody does the plan,
then there is no plan.
So my cook,
Baker,

754
00:41:19.031 --> 00:41:22.930
chef thing is trying to help people put them in a position where they actually

755
00:41:22.931 --> 00:41:27.880
might execute the plan.
So give them something they're going to be excited about.

756
00:41:28.330 --> 00:41:32.500
That doesn't give too much anxiety.
Now what's a chef?

757
00:41:35.390 --> 00:41:36.940
Is a chef following recipes or not?

758
00:41:38.550 --> 00:41:39.383
<v 2>Not really.</v>

759
00:41:40.340 --> 00:41:42.560
<v 0>Why can a chef not follow recipes?</v>

760
00:41:43.850 --> 00:41:47.420
Because they followed the recipe exactly for so many years.

761
00:41:48.200 --> 00:41:51.260
They have an advanced degree in that and now they understand when to break those

762
00:41:51.261 --> 00:41:54.730
rules.
They understand the consequences,

763
00:41:54.731 --> 00:41:57.790
they understand how things are working to a level they can innovate.

764
00:41:57.791 --> 00:41:59.350
They can do things differently because they know,

765
00:41:59.351 --> 00:42:01.960
okay well I'm going to do less of that.
What I got to do this on the backend.

766
00:42:03.260 --> 00:42:05.060
Oh Cook doesn't have that experience or knowledge.

767
00:42:05.061 --> 00:42:09.440
They didn't put in the groundwork the years of working to understand,
no,

768
00:42:09.441 --> 00:42:12.620
you can't just throw the oil end.
Yeah it's going to blow up and you know,

769
00:42:12.621 --> 00:42:14.990
spot splatter huddle over your face.
All right,

770
00:42:14.991 --> 00:42:17.030
but the chef probably did that a bunch of times.

771
00:42:17.720 --> 00:42:20.590
That's what I learned that those lessons and now they can break rules cause they

772
00:42:20.591 --> 00:42:23.240
understand,
well you can do this as a,
you can't do that,
but you can break that,

773
00:42:23.241 --> 00:42:25.400
that,
that and then that.
Right.

774
00:42:25.401 --> 00:42:29.180
So a chef is somebody that understand those rules to a such a level.

775
00:42:29.181 --> 00:42:33.590
I can go boom and I can weave back and forth between communicating like a baker

776
00:42:34.100 --> 00:42:36.280
or a cook with them and and I'm,

777
00:42:36.290 --> 00:42:38.900
I'm confident they won't break those fundamental rules that I didn't want them

778
00:42:38.901 --> 00:42:42.410
to break.
Or my ideal goal of course,

779
00:42:42.411 --> 00:42:44.630
is to work everyone up to being a chef to where I can go.

780
00:42:45.600 --> 00:42:48.640
So it's me when you need me,
right?

781
00:42:49.150 --> 00:42:50.800
With any of these things I'm trying to,

782
00:42:50.860 --> 00:42:52.150
and this is really a big part of the book,

783
00:42:52.570 --> 00:42:55.740
I'm trying to push people away from becoming self dependent.

784
00:42:56.550 --> 00:42:57.880
It's becoming self reliant.

785
00:42:59.140 --> 00:43:04.000
If you have to follow a textbook or an app to eat every day,

786
00:43:04.990 --> 00:43:09.770
you're becoming dependent on that,
right?
That's not what we want you to be.

787
00:43:09.771 --> 00:43:11.570
Wanting to be self reliant where you can go,
okay,

788
00:43:11.571 --> 00:43:14.510
this was a great starting place.
This helped me learn my body more.

789
00:43:14.690 --> 00:43:16.910
This diet that I followed,
I followed it to a tee.

790
00:43:16.911 --> 00:43:18.290
I didn't make any variations in it.

791
00:43:18.710 --> 00:43:21.830
I learned a lot more about what I react well to them.
I don't rap to look great.

792
00:43:22.070 --> 00:43:25.250
Now I'm going to ditch the book.
That's the plan.
It's the magic thing

793
00:43:26.770 --> 00:43:28.900
and start changing things on my own.
Oh No.

794
00:43:28.901 --> 00:43:31.060
Understanding of what that triggered me really fast.
Oh my gosh.

795
00:43:31.061 --> 00:43:34.090
Now I'm feeling super tired.
I'm nodding off after lunch.
Okay.

796
00:43:34.091 --> 00:43:36.570
It's because I added this.
I can't do that.

797
00:43:36.580 --> 00:43:38.170
I gotta make this combination different.
Right?

798
00:43:38.530 --> 00:43:42.970
And so it should be used to help you advance,
not regress you back to,

799
00:43:43.630 --> 00:43:46.240
oh,
I don't have my book,
my app crashed,
my phone died.
Oh my God,

800
00:43:46.241 --> 00:43:49.720
I don't know what to eat for lunch.
Okay.
That's what happens.
Right?

801
00:43:49.780 --> 00:43:52.990
When we don't want you to be at that level.
So you don't want to give people,

802
00:43:52.991 --> 00:43:55.150
when you give people very specific answers,

803
00:43:56.350 --> 00:43:59.380
they become reliant upon those answers and they don't become,

804
00:43:59.560 --> 00:44:01.900
or they become dependent upon those answers.
They don't become self reliant.

805
00:44:02.500 --> 00:44:04.960
And that's really where we're trying to get people to get there because anyone

806
00:44:04.961 --> 00:44:09.490
who's ever had a significant change in their health function or performance is a

807
00:44:09.491 --> 00:44:13.570
lifestyle change.
And that's where we're always trying to get people to get to,

808
00:44:14.580 --> 00:44:19.450
right?
If you make them dependent upon external forces information.

809
00:44:20.080 --> 00:44:24.560
If you make them be a permit baker,
they'll never going to become a chef.

810
00:44:25.410 --> 00:44:27.060
But if you're always a cook as well,

811
00:44:28.310 --> 00:44:30.170
you'll never know what to do to become a chef either.

812
00:44:30.230 --> 00:44:32.260
So there's a little bit of both.
We have to go back to this.

813
00:44:32.270 --> 00:44:36.750
So that's generally what I do.
So when I'm working with an athlete in my head,

814
00:44:36.751 --> 00:44:41.520
I go,
okay,
all right Steve,
right?
He's a baker.
I'm filtering everything through.

815
00:44:41.521 --> 00:44:45.900
Bakers do well with a bunch of instructions,
very specific detail,
cooks,

816
00:44:46.950 --> 00:44:51.760
shore piece of information and they don't care why,
right?
So four,

817
00:44:51.810 --> 00:44:54.420
we'll go back there again.
We're,
I'm working with you all as a nutritionist,

818
00:44:55.290 --> 00:44:56.460
if I gave you is I said,
hey,

819
00:44:56.461 --> 00:45:01.440
I want you to take 11 wall nuts going to eat those at 11:00 AM 11 not 12 you'd

820
00:45:01.441 --> 00:45:03.780
probably go,
cool,
great.
I'm in.
But why

821
00:45:06.210 --> 00:45:09.230
you wouldn't give a shit?
I'm like,
sweet,
I'm on it.
Let me go 11 here we are.

822
00:45:09.240 --> 00:45:12.540
We're done.
Cooks don't care about the why.

823
00:45:13.560 --> 00:45:15.810
Baker's tend to care about the why.
So the baker,

824
00:45:15.811 --> 00:45:18.840
I spend more time with the buying of explaining to them how it's going to work.

825
00:45:19.080 --> 00:45:22.050
Well,
it's because we saw this in your blood panel and we saw this in your school

826
00:45:22.051 --> 00:45:25.530
sample.
We're doing this.
Okay,
great.
Bakers or cooks just one or the answer.

827
00:45:26.230 --> 00:45:28.920
Great question.
Yeah,
I'm in,
I'm out.
Come back in a month,

828
00:45:29.370 --> 00:45:30.400
let me know if it didn't work right.

829
00:45:31.290 --> 00:45:33.780
And so it's just trying to help improve communication.

830
00:45:33.781 --> 00:45:38.130
And my decade is a teacher has helped me build that.

831
00:45:38.131 --> 00:45:39.540
So although I'm a hard scientist,

832
00:45:39.541 --> 00:45:43.440
I'm a qualitative or quantitative scientist by nature,
I'm also,

833
00:45:43.950 --> 00:45:48.390
I spend a lot of time teaching and so really I developed that as a tool with

834
00:45:48.391 --> 00:45:51.150
both my students and my athletes is a way of saying,
okay,

835
00:45:51.540 --> 00:45:56.460
how can I change my system so that I can improve for them?

836
00:45:57.450 --> 00:46:00.120
I'm trying,
I'm not trying to make all of my athletes,

837
00:46:00.750 --> 00:46:05.520
chefs or all my students,
some don't want to be.
Some of you might realize like,

838
00:46:05.521 --> 00:46:09.270
look,
it's your show is not my jam.
I want to be healthier,
but I'm not,

839
00:46:09.271 --> 00:46:12.420
I'm not going to dive into it.
I'm not gonna start reading stuff like,
okay,
great.

840
00:46:12.421 --> 00:46:17.210
I'm not going to try to make that person a chef.
All right.
Yeah,

841
00:46:17.390 --> 00:46:20.720
I don't,
I don't want you to work how I work.
I want you to work how you work.

842
00:46:21.140 --> 00:46:24.980
You tell me how you work and I will change to help you.
That's my job.

843
00:46:25.610 --> 00:46:27.920
When you hire me and pay me to help you do something,

844
00:46:28.370 --> 00:46:30.350
I'm not trying to push you into my system.

845
00:46:30.830 --> 00:46:34.160
I'm trying to change to fit you and give a system to whatever you want.

846
00:46:34.490 --> 00:46:36.060
That's what I'm really trying to do.
It

847
00:46:36.510 --> 00:46:38.970
<v 1>no nice.
That's,
I mean,
if that's a great approach to everything and you know,</v>

848
00:46:38.971 --> 00:46:40.440
the more that we can adapt to our audience,

849
00:46:40.441 --> 00:46:43.330
whether it's in the workplace and nutritional space,
then uh,

850
00:46:43.380 --> 00:46:44.880
the more impactful the message will be.
Right.

851
00:46:46.260 --> 00:46:50.310
<v 0>That's cool.
Nice.
So I'm at this point,
I'd love to open it up to questions.
Um,</v>

852
00:46:50.680 --> 00:46:52.830
all right.
Oh,
shocking.
All right.
Has a question.

853
00:46:53.610 --> 00:46:58.030
<v 1>So Your Rita?
Yup.
Alright.
We practiced this before,
so you've got this,
I'm ready.</v>

854
00:46:58.200 --> 00:47:01.980
Oh my gosh.
What are we doing here?
Yes,
it's googleable that was pretty athletic.

855
00:47:02.140 --> 00:47:06.770
Yeah.
Well I do work out.
Ah,
ah,

856
00:47:07.320 --> 00:47:10.620
thanks very much for coming.
And I've found the talk very interesting.
Um,

857
00:47:10.650 --> 00:47:13.620
one of the things I think is most interesting is how much you've talked about

858
00:47:13.860 --> 00:47:17.790
nutrition and how it's extremely subjective.
I mean,

859
00:47:17.791 --> 00:47:21.930
yes you can call me a baker,
but for nine years I was vegetarian,

860
00:47:21.931 --> 00:47:25.710
seven years of that I was Vegan and that was kind of by accident,

861
00:47:25.711 --> 00:47:29.320
but it was also kind of because I was told by a bunch of friends that it was

862
00:47:29.321 --> 00:47:32.950
better for my health.
I read some books on it,
they all said it was better for me.

863
00:47:33.280 --> 00:47:38.140
Um,
and then I developed hypoglycemia.
Yup.
And really bad acid reflux,

864
00:47:38.141 --> 00:47:40.930
which I didn't know was caused by that.
Um,

865
00:47:40.960 --> 00:47:45.220
I went back to eating gradually everything and 10 years later still was

866
00:47:45.221 --> 00:47:50.140
hypoglycemic,
still having problems with the acid reflux.
So,

867
00:47:50.200 --> 00:47:54.480
um,
I read the blood type diet book.
Okay.
I'm sure you're familiar with it.
Yeah,

868
00:47:54.600 --> 00:47:58.090
sure.
Um,
and it's like,
not very scientific,
but you know,

869
00:47:58.091 --> 00:48:02.100
I was like willing to give it a try.
I'm a baker.
So I followed the,
the,

870
00:48:02.290 --> 00:48:04.570
the recipes or you know,
the instructions.

871
00:48:04.960 --> 00:48:09.220
And within two months my hypoglycemia was gone.
Awesome.
Within three months,

872
00:48:09.280 --> 00:48:14.200
acid reflux all gone.
And now I don't follow it religiously because I,
I,

873
00:48:14.201 --> 00:48:16.690
I've actually graduated to being a chef.
I don't like to brag,

874
00:48:16.691 --> 00:48:19.150
but it's totally fine.

875
00:48:19.750 --> 00:48:23.140
But I did experiment with all this stuff.
And,
and what I've told people,

876
00:48:23.141 --> 00:48:24.580
especially people that,
um,

877
00:48:24.610 --> 00:48:29.260
that we know that are like really hardcore vegetarians and vegans is that it's

878
00:48:29.261 --> 00:48:32.720
not for everyone.
No.
And it really is a personal choice and,

879
00:48:32.721 --> 00:48:36.260
and it's not about the s saving the planet is great and,

880
00:48:36.310 --> 00:48:39.910
and saving the animals is great and saving the environment is great.

881
00:48:40.090 --> 00:48:42.330
There's other ways I can do that.
Yup.
Um,

882
00:48:42.490 --> 00:48:46.620
that are not going to affect how I feel every day.
And um,

883
00:48:46.660 --> 00:48:50.350
I was just wondering what kind of advice do you offer to people when they're,

884
00:48:50.830 --> 00:48:55.660
so I'm attached to a diet,

885
00:48:55.661 --> 00:48:58.330
which by the way is from the Greek.
It means way of life.

886
00:48:58.540 --> 00:49:02.980
They're so attached to a diet that actually is hurting them and they refused for

887
00:49:03.010 --> 00:49:07.270
like usually moral reasons like because of the animals,
they won't let go of it.

888
00:49:07.320 --> 00:49:08.710
Sure.
Even though it's hurting them.

889
00:49:08.810 --> 00:49:13.280
<v 0>So a couple of things.
Number one,
the vegetarian Vegan argument,</v>

890
00:49:13.610 --> 00:49:17.140
you have to tease out ethics from health,
right?
Right.

891
00:49:17.210 --> 00:49:20.870
Those are separate conversations.
You can't,
you can't believe back and forth.

892
00:49:21.680 --> 00:49:24.080
So I'll leave the moral ethics stuff aside.
It's not what I do.

893
00:49:24.620 --> 00:49:25.490
I can certainly comment on it.

894
00:49:25.491 --> 00:49:29.030
This is not the best use of our short time here today.
The health thing is,

895
00:49:29.120 --> 00:49:32.000
is the easier approach as you mentioned,

896
00:49:33.080 --> 00:49:38.080
it would be extremely arrogant and shortsighted for us to think all seven,

897
00:49:39.680 --> 00:49:44.570
seven and a half billion people have to eat the same way and that our health

898
00:49:44.571 --> 00:49:47.030
would be optimized eating the same way.

899
00:49:49.220 --> 00:49:53.600
It's undeniable.
Some people do fantastic on those sites.
Health wise.

900
00:49:54.350 --> 00:49:56.000
It's also undeniable.
Some don't.

901
00:49:56.420 --> 00:50:00.110
It's pretty silly also to think you have to eat like that to be healthy.

902
00:50:00.440 --> 00:50:04.010
Go pick your evidence point evolution,
our biology,

903
00:50:04.910 --> 00:50:08.180
current clinical,
uh,
randomized clinical trials.
None of it,
Matt.

904
00:50:08.181 --> 00:50:11.150
None of it lines up,
right?
So any of that is a win and it's overwhelming.

905
00:50:11.151 --> 00:50:15.650
It's just you can't ignore that or even really ethically debate that.
Right?

906
00:50:16.520 --> 00:50:18.860
You can't genuinely debate that.
It's just silly.

907
00:50:19.190 --> 00:50:21.110
The bigger problem I think that puts into,

908
00:50:23.120 --> 00:50:25.010
we as humans have been around for a long time.

909
00:50:27.560 --> 00:50:28.220
<v 3>How</v>

910
00:50:28.220 --> 00:50:33.220
<v 0>could you in a objective logical mind think we</v>

911
00:50:35.240 --> 00:50:39.200
were the generation that figured it out?
Like are you kidding?

912
00:50:40.460 --> 00:50:41.640
What do you think the generation and what,

913
00:50:41.641 --> 00:50:44.470
what do you think someone's going to do in 10 years from now?
No,
no.

914
00:50:44.510 --> 00:50:46.160
They're the ones that figured out your life.

915
00:50:46.580 --> 00:50:49.610
And so I think if you run the circle pattern enough,
you realize,
oh,

916
00:50:49.611 --> 00:50:52.070
what's the answer?
What's the common thread between all of it?

917
00:50:53.480 --> 00:50:56.030
There is no single best diet,

918
00:50:56.520 --> 00:50:57.350
<v 2>right?</v>

919
00:50:57.350 --> 00:51:00.990
<v 0>That that's not going to exist.
It never will.</v>

920
00:51:02.370 --> 00:51:04.080
There is not a single best approach.
And again,

921
00:51:04.081 --> 00:51:06.330
why do you think you even have to do one approach your whole life?

922
00:51:06.780 --> 00:51:08.850
So why not go Vegan,
vegetarian for a year

923
00:51:10.560 --> 00:51:13.590
and then go back and then something else?
Why not more?

924
00:51:13.591 --> 00:51:15.720
Why does it have to be one answer or whole time?

925
00:51:16.200 --> 00:51:21.060
Anyone that claims that a diet like that is these single answer for an entire

926
00:51:21.061 --> 00:51:23.070
generation or entire population.

927
00:51:24.780 --> 00:51:26.280
Maybe they have good intentions in mind,

928
00:51:26.281 --> 00:51:28.650
but it's not the right approach at generally doesn't help people.

929
00:51:28.651 --> 00:51:30.270
So the second part of your question,

930
00:51:30.271 --> 00:51:33.000
how do you communicate with these people that are entrenched?
Number one,

931
00:51:33.001 --> 00:51:37.840
you can't.
If people aren't ready to change,
they don't change.
Uh,

932
00:51:38.070 --> 00:51:42.870
information always helps,
but it has to be genuine information.
So for example,

933
00:51:43.230 --> 00:51:47.610
I could very easy easily stand up here and attack those diets from a science

934
00:51:47.611 --> 00:51:50.100
perspective.
But I don't do that because it doesn't help anything.

935
00:51:50.790 --> 00:51:53.820
People that like Vegan vegetarian are not going to be excited by that.

936
00:51:53.821 --> 00:51:55.860
It's not going to help anybody.
People in the middle don't like it.

937
00:51:56.550 --> 00:51:58.290
You can get a lot more views on youtube.

938
00:51:58.890 --> 00:52:03.150
Like you could cut a little clip out there like Dr Galpin blast vegetarian and

939
00:52:03.151 --> 00:52:07.470
Google talk.
I'm not interested in that crap.
It doesn't help the movement.

940
00:52:07.471 --> 00:52:08.840
What helps us information,
right?
And,

941
00:52:08.850 --> 00:52:12.630
and there's a ton of information out there and being genuinely compassionate and

942
00:52:12.631 --> 00:52:16.860
empathetic for those people,
really trying to help them and when they're ready.

943
00:52:17.210 --> 00:52:22.050
Uh,
again,
my approach is,
so when I,
I have worked with vegetarian,
Vegan athletes,

944
00:52:22.560 --> 00:52:26.250
I have not once uttered any of them that we should change their diet with

945
00:52:26.280 --> 00:52:29.280
exceptions of the one that has been like,
hmm,

946
00:52:29.550 --> 00:52:33.930
I want to do this because I thought it's healthier that person as well.
Why?

947
00:52:34.530 --> 00:52:36.240
Why did you think that?
Why do you think that,
okay,
great.

948
00:52:36.241 --> 00:52:38.730
And if they have a very good reason,
I'm not against it,
I would go there.

949
00:52:39.240 --> 00:52:40.650
I will use any tool that they want,

950
00:52:40.830 --> 00:52:43.470
but I will never take a person that comes to me and says,
look,
I'm Vegan.

951
00:52:43.471 --> 00:52:45.720
I want to be vegetarian but this,
and this is going on.

952
00:52:45.721 --> 00:52:47.460
I want to improve my health,
but I want to stay vegetarian.

953
00:52:47.640 --> 00:52:50.280
I would never start the conversation off about how to get them away from

954
00:52:50.281 --> 00:52:54.270
vegetarian.
My goal is to help them succeed with what they're doing.

955
00:52:55.440 --> 00:52:57.900
So that's my approach.
Once they do that,

956
00:52:57.901 --> 00:53:01.920
they're probably more likely to understand you care about them and then they

957
00:53:01.921 --> 00:53:04.650
might start opening up and being like,
well really what do you think about,

958
00:53:04.680 --> 00:53:07.530
you think it is healthier this way?
And then I'll give her my honest opinion,

959
00:53:07.531 --> 00:53:10.790
but I'm not going to walk in and start pushing when I have an athlete that comes

960
00:53:10.791 --> 00:53:12.330
into with with Kido and it things,

961
00:53:12.331 --> 00:53:15.240
my goal is not to push them away from any of that stuff.

962
00:53:15.270 --> 00:53:17.280
I want to help them succeed with what they want to doing.

963
00:53:17.281 --> 00:53:19.020
And if I walk them to see like where are you at?

964
00:53:19.021 --> 00:53:23.430
Scale of one to 10 with a vegetarian veganism in terms of willing to give it up.

965
00:53:23.431 --> 00:53:27.000
Not if they go nine,
great.
I'm not even going to subconsciously,

966
00:53:27.180 --> 00:53:29.460
I'm not going to like hit little jabs at him.
I'm not even going to try.

967
00:53:29.490 --> 00:53:31.410
That's not,
that's how they came here for.

968
00:53:31.650 --> 00:53:34.230
They came to me because I want to get better with what they're at.
Fine.

969
00:53:34.740 --> 00:53:38.280
Just like somebody that came to me with a carnivore diet or any other crazy
diet.

970
00:53:38.850 --> 00:53:40.230
That's what you wanna do.
Great.
Okay.
Well,

971
00:53:40.231 --> 00:53:41.640
I'll do my best to try to help you through that,

972
00:53:41.641 --> 00:53:43.740
but I'm not going to try to change you unless you want to change.

973
00:53:45.030 --> 00:53:47.250
Then all of a sudden I'll maybe help.
But that's not my goal.

974
00:53:47.490 --> 00:53:48.480
I don't want to him when he's eating.

975
00:53:48.481 --> 00:53:52.050
I don't want him to believe in my philosophies.
Um,
I'll try to help you as I can,

976
00:53:52.051 --> 00:53:53.220
but that doesn't help anyone.

977
00:53:57.530 --> 00:53:58.363
<v 2>Nice.</v>

978
00:53:58.730 --> 00:54:02.880
<v 4>Yeah.
Some you said there is no single solution for things.
Uh,</v>

979
00:54:02.960 --> 00:54:07.940
but also I,
well I have like knee condition or ankle condition.

980
00:54:07.941 --> 00:54:11.600
I've realized that there was no,
even the x per say,

981
00:54:12.200 --> 00:54:15.260
different things about how to treat my conditions.

982
00:54:15.710 --> 00:54:20.540
And so you've been working with the best people,
uh,
in that area.

983
00:54:20.541 --> 00:54:21.620
So,
uh,

984
00:54:21.710 --> 00:54:26.710
can you give us a tip on how to find the good doctor or Neutropenia?

985
00:54:26.860 --> 00:54:29.780
The nutrition is toward physic.
Yeah,

986
00:54:30.010 --> 00:54:34.220
<v 0>that's,
that's such a good question.
I get that probably more than anything else.</v>

987
00:54:34.760 --> 00:54:38.150
When I do media or in a classroom,
it's a,

988
00:54:38.210 --> 00:54:42.650
it's something that I wish I had perfectly solved myself.
Right.
But I don't.

989
00:54:43.130 --> 00:54:44.360
You can look for red flags though.

990
00:54:45.290 --> 00:54:49.850
If anybody is selling a product directly behind themselves,

991
00:54:50.180 --> 00:54:52.760
it's not,
it's not a bias.
It's not guaranteed wrong,

992
00:54:53.120 --> 00:54:56.790
but if the answer to every single person that walks in our clinic is,
Oh yeah,

993
00:54:56.791 --> 00:55:00.380
yeah,
you got to take this thing,
then you start to be like,
hm,
weird.

994
00:55:00.800 --> 00:55:02.210
The other ones you want to pay attention to,

995
00:55:02.211 --> 00:55:06.620
are they the ones that are treating symptoms?
Not Problem,
right?

996
00:55:06.621 --> 00:55:07.101
You want them what?

997
00:55:07.101 --> 00:55:10.580
Find the ones that address a problem in the last piece I'll say to that is you

998
00:55:10.581 --> 00:55:14.180
want to find people that are treating the entire system,

999
00:55:15.800 --> 00:55:19.940
not the knee,
because the knee is a symptom.
That's the signal,

1000
00:55:20.060 --> 00:55:22.620
but that may not be the cause of the problem.
I am,

1001
00:55:22.640 --> 00:55:24.050
I don't know what your knee issue is,

1002
00:55:24.051 --> 00:55:28.040
but it might be something that it might be because of your neck.

1003
00:55:29.120 --> 00:55:32.960
It might be because of your right shoulder and so you want to find a physician

1004
00:55:33.140 --> 00:55:36.620
that asks questions about everything.
They'll sit you down and go,
okay,

1005
00:55:36.621 --> 00:55:39.260
you have any problem talking about any problem?
Okay,
great.
Well,
let me see.

1006
00:55:39.261 --> 00:55:42.860
You walk.
Okay,
let's take this other thing.
Well,
tell me about your diet.

1007
00:55:42.890 --> 00:55:46.130
Tell me what,
when do you feel most symptoms?
When are you feeling it?
Flare Up.

1008
00:55:46.131 --> 00:55:48.650
What activities get her.
Okay,
great.
Well,
let's look at your posture.

1009
00:55:48.651 --> 00:55:51.170
Let's look at how you move.
How do you sleep?
What's your desk look like?

1010
00:55:51.440 --> 00:55:54.140
What's your car ride?
Are you commuting a lot?
And then we can be,
okay,

1011
00:55:54.141 --> 00:55:56.510
what's your stress?
How much are you sleeping?
That's,

1012
00:55:56.540 --> 00:56:00.200
that's somebody who will fix your problem.
So those are the people I look for.
If,

1013
00:56:00.440 --> 00:56:01.430
if you're,
if you're,

1014
00:56:01.460 --> 00:56:03.810
if you're going to the position or the physical therapist and they go,
okay,

1015
00:56:03.811 --> 00:56:06.500
what's you need problem?
All the back of my knee hurts when I stand up too much.

1016
00:56:06.710 --> 00:56:10.340
Okay,
great.
Uh,
do three sets of 10 of this.
Like Garth walkout gone.

1017
00:56:10.580 --> 00:56:14.540
Like they're not fixing anything.
Or if they just went,
oh,
okay,
great.
Um,

1018
00:56:14.541 --> 00:56:17.330
start on these anti-inflammatories and we'll see what happens.

1019
00:56:19.430 --> 00:56:21.080
Not gonna work,
man,
like not going to work.

1020
00:56:21.081 --> 00:56:25.420
So keep walking out of those offices until you find somebody that really treats

1021
00:56:25.421 --> 00:56:27.730
the symptom.
And it's really hard.
Of course,

1022
00:56:27.731 --> 00:56:30.400
I could give you personal referrals to people,

1023
00:56:30.401 --> 00:56:33.790
but I don't want to sound like a plugging anybody specifically because there's

1024
00:56:33.950 --> 00:56:38.920
tons of people to do this.
Um,
you can look up,
um,
I make,

1025
00:56:38.950 --> 00:56:40.880
I didn't want to say this,
but to hell with it,
I'll just say it.

1026
00:56:41.500 --> 00:56:44.500
You can look up functional medicine now.

1027
00:56:44.530 --> 00:56:47.020
Some functional medicine practitioners are complete quacks,

1028
00:56:47.890 --> 00:56:52.360
but a lot of them tend to be decent and that's a good start because they tend to

1029
00:56:52.361 --> 00:56:56.680
treat the body.
It's a really bad buzz term right now.
Be Very careful with it.

1030
00:56:56.681 --> 00:57:00.070
There's a lot of hot and cold on functional medicine right now.

1031
00:57:00.460 --> 00:57:04.350
There's some bad stuff going on with that as well,
but some of that,

1032
00:57:04.360 --> 00:57:06.850
they at least are pushing the concept forward of treating the system.

1033
00:57:06.850 --> 00:57:09.910
I think one of the biggest miss services we've ever done in the field of health

1034
00:57:10.390 --> 00:57:13.900
and fitness is teaching people different body systems.

1035
00:57:14.860 --> 00:57:17.360
You learn the muscle system and you learn the bone system.

1036
00:57:17.390 --> 00:57:19.750
You learn the nervous system because that's not how that works.

1037
00:57:20.380 --> 00:57:23.920
And it makes people think siloed.
Oh,
I have a bone problem,

1038
00:57:23.921 --> 00:57:28.510
therefore fixed the bone.
Well,
it might be a nerve issue.
It might be a gut issue.

1039
00:57:29.830 --> 00:57:32.440
It might be as might be the fact that you don't sleep well.

1040
00:57:33.740 --> 00:57:35.500
It turns out when you sleep well,
all these things go away.

1041
00:57:35.620 --> 00:57:38.200
The body works in systems.
We have multiple things,
right?

1042
00:57:38.350 --> 00:57:42.960
So when you fix those big hanging fruit,
everything tends to start the lineup.

1043
00:57:43.710 --> 00:57:44.050
Uh,

1044
00:57:44.050 --> 00:57:47.800
so I would go to a physician or a therapist or whoever you're looking for that

1045
00:57:47.801 --> 00:57:52.801
asks all the questions about the lifestyle habits and that fixes your problem.

1046
00:57:53.020 --> 00:57:54.850
So a long answer,
but that's my real answer.

1047
00:57:55.500 --> 00:57:56.333
<v 2>Thanks.</v>

1048
00:58:00.380 --> 00:58:03.140
<v 0>Oh,
minus 10.</v>

1049
00:58:06.400 --> 00:58:10.240
<v 5>So you talked a lot about like finding a balance within,
um,</v>

1050
00:58:10.330 --> 00:58:13.560
the choices you make and making sure that you understand the consequences of

1051
00:58:13.610 --> 00:58:14.443
things to do.

1052
00:58:14.590 --> 00:58:18.790
I'm curious to understand how do you approach something like weight cutting?

1053
00:58:19.220 --> 00:58:21.760
Something that I'm like,
UFC fighters have to do,

1054
00:58:21.761 --> 00:58:24.050
like they just have to make a certain way.
Um,
yeah.

1055
00:58:25.690 --> 00:58:28.510
<v 0>I'll give you a global answer and then maybe you can follow up with this</v>

1056
00:58:28.511 --> 00:58:29.370
specific thing.
So,

1057
00:58:29.371 --> 00:58:31.870
I'm not sure exactly what you're asking so you can do a follow up here,

1058
00:58:31.871 --> 00:58:36.700
but it's like anything else during that extreme weight cut and we've,

1059
00:58:36.800 --> 00:58:41.080
we've been a part of some very extreme lens.
You're talking people,

1060
00:58:41.081 --> 00:58:44.410
I'm the closest one,
the biggest one I've ever been.

1061
00:58:44.440 --> 00:58:45.970
Even just peripherally a part of,

1062
00:58:46.330 --> 00:58:51.330
we had an APP that you go from 252 pounds down to 185 pounds,

1063
00:58:53.040 --> 00:58:57.550
right?
Really probably had 12 weeks for that or something.
Um,

1064
00:58:57.580 --> 00:59:02.020
I've seen people though within,
uh,
let's say on a Tuesday,

1065
00:59:02.050 --> 00:59:04.450
weigh ins are usually Friday.
Um,
you know,

1066
00:59:04.451 --> 00:59:08.810
go from one 78 to one 55.
Uh,

1067
00:59:09.040 --> 00:59:13.480
I've seen 20 pounds,
20 pounds cut in 24 hours or less.
Of course,

1068
00:59:13.481 --> 00:59:15.490
that's almost exclusively water,
right?

1069
00:59:16.900 --> 00:59:19.840
So the really way I manage that is you go through those periods,

1070
00:59:19.841 --> 00:59:21.260
and I can tell a story about this.

1071
00:59:21.290 --> 00:59:26.290
I worked with an athlete who won a gold medal in Rio Olympics and about four

1072
00:59:26.391 --> 00:59:29.900
months out,
two or three months out,
the weight just stopped coming off.

1073
00:59:29.930 --> 00:59:34.930
And that's because she had been in a state of low calorie for nine 10 12 months.

1074
00:59:36.380 --> 00:59:40.700
And we had to match that optimization with adaptations.

1075
00:59:40.701 --> 00:59:44.690
So what we did actually is we gave her a boatload of carbohydrate way up on

1076
00:59:44.691 --> 00:59:49.190
calories,
almost all from vegetable and weight.
Just started falling off.

1077
00:59:49.550 --> 00:59:53.120
Just started coming up because she had been so low calorie.

1078
00:59:53.121 --> 00:59:55.850
And what generally when low calorie you get low nutrient because you just don't

1079
00:59:55.851 --> 00:59:59.060
have quantity.
We had to go there other.
So it was like,

1080
00:59:59.360 --> 01:00:00.830
let's make the body feel better for a minute.

1081
01:00:01.610 --> 01:00:03.980
Let's give you a couple of weeks of feeling better.
And as soon as it did that,

1082
01:00:03.981 --> 01:00:05.150
it kind of relax if you will.

1083
01:00:06.050 --> 01:00:09.620
And then the fat started falling off and she got down midway,
no problem,

1084
01:00:09.621 --> 01:00:10.454
want to go metal.

1085
01:00:11.000 --> 01:00:14.540
He became the first American actually female ever to win gold medal and

1086
01:00:14.541 --> 01:00:18.110
wrestling.
So they're like,
this is a huge thing.
She upset,
uh,

1087
01:00:18.200 --> 01:00:22.470
16 times straight world champion I had to beat.
So we,

1088
01:00:22.471 --> 01:00:24.560
you have to match at the same way.
So when my athletes come,

1089
01:00:24.561 --> 01:00:26.690
I literally had a conversation this morning with one of mine.

1090
01:00:27.950 --> 01:00:31.220
When you come off that hard cut thing,
we have to match it with,
let's restore.

1091
01:00:31.610 --> 01:00:36.560
That's recover.
That's not ballooned up to two 50 again,
but let's match it there.

1092
01:00:36.561 --> 01:00:39.440
So that's I think,
but I'm not sure what you're really asking.
Good follow up now.

1093
01:00:40.220 --> 01:00:44.360
I mean,
those basic rules asking mood.
Um,
could you speak more specific to like,

1094
01:00:44.510 --> 01:00:49.280
um,
like how do you,
like after,
after the event,
after they started recovery,

1095
01:00:49.310 --> 01:00:52.490
like how do you do it in a way that's like,

1096
01:00:52.640 --> 01:00:54.940
so one key,
um,

1097
01:00:55.820 --> 01:01:00.740
[inaudible] had someone one time after a pretty big weight cut one,
a very big,

1098
01:01:00.850 --> 01:01:02.300
um,
competition.

1099
01:01:02.390 --> 01:01:06.320
She was extremely excited and had been in a very,

1100
01:01:06.470 --> 01:01:10.640
very clean diet for months.
And then she sent me a picture because she was on,
um,

1101
01:01:11.730 --> 01:01:13.460
I don't know,
one of those daytime talk shows or something.

1102
01:01:13.461 --> 01:01:16.080
One of the big news things afterwards.
And she sent me a picture,

1103
01:01:16.081 --> 01:01:19.490
like they brought me in and pizza and chocolate and all this stuff.
And I'm like,

1104
01:01:19.491 --> 01:01:23.060
do not eat that.
I'm like,
yes,
it's reward time,

1105
01:01:23.270 --> 01:01:25.130
but you're going to blow up like this is not.

1106
01:01:25.370 --> 01:01:27.980
Of course she ate it and very much regretted it.

1107
01:01:27.981 --> 01:01:30.500
We'll put it that way if you get what I'm saying.

1108
01:01:31.460 --> 01:01:34.100
Not that not what you want to be feeling when you're on national TV.

1109
01:01:35.430 --> 01:01:38.270
My point is it's just going back to the same thing.

1110
01:01:38.271 --> 01:01:41.210
We just start increasing calories,
but you can't just go off the rails.

1111
01:01:41.780 --> 01:01:44.190
I made this mistake one time after a personal,
uh,

1112
01:01:44.220 --> 01:01:48.950
weight cut of my own and I went to,
to um,
to a place that serves wings and beer.

1113
01:01:49.620 --> 01:01:53.870
It was like I have one beer and a bunch of wings and fries.
Oh my gosh.
The worst.

1114
01:01:53.871 --> 01:01:56.080
Right?
You feel awful.
And so you,
you,
oh,

1115
01:01:56.210 --> 01:01:58.010
you bring in counties and you can have a little bit of a treat,

1116
01:01:58.011 --> 01:02:01.040
but you have to work yourself back into that stuff as well.
And the,

1117
01:02:01.110 --> 01:02:03.920
the very detail,
it's the same food.
You just need a little more.

1118
01:02:04.340 --> 01:02:09.160
It's more vegetable,
more fresh fruit,
maybe a little bit more,
uh,

1119
01:02:09.380 --> 01:02:12.110
fat if you want,
but you're eating real whole foods.

1120
01:02:12.770 --> 01:02:13.970
Once you do that for a little bit,

1121
01:02:13.971 --> 01:02:16.850
then you can actually have the luxury to eat ice cream or cake or whatever

1122
01:02:16.851 --> 01:02:19.650
little indulgence wine like hers was wine.
Okay fine.

1123
01:02:20.340 --> 01:02:24.390
But you can't just go off the rails and just go back from really fresh,

1124
01:02:24.540 --> 01:02:29.310
clean foods for nine months to garbage,
you're going to get destroyed.

1125
01:02:29.850 --> 01:02:32.310
So that's really what we do.
It's just the same way we come back up.

1126
01:02:33.420 --> 01:02:37.140
And you have to be careful though because about two months later it was like,

1127
01:02:37.860 --> 01:02:41.910
yeah.
So you remember how you said I can add a little bit of chocolate now?
Yeah,

1128
01:02:41.911 --> 01:02:44.790
I'm pretty much eating chocolate every day,
all day.
I was like all right,

1129
01:02:44.791 --> 01:02:47.070
time to tighten back down like,
and come back the other way.

1130
01:02:47.190 --> 01:02:48.780
So it's just balancing those two things.
