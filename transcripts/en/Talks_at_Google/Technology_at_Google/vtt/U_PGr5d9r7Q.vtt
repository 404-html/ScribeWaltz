1
00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:10.130
Thought it would be nice to start off this talk with another talk.
Um,

2
00:00:11.030 --> 00:00:15.860
this is Muriel Cooper head age 68 and she was,
this is the years 1994.

3
00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:16.730
Um,

4
00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:21.410
she's on stage at the fifth annual technology entertainment and design

5
00:00:21.411 --> 00:00:24.620
conference held in Monterey,
California.
It's,
this is a ted talk.

6
00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:28.610
It doesn't quite look like a Ted talk cause you notice she doesn't have on

7
00:00:28.611 --> 00:00:32.990
choose to start with.
Um,
and she's made herself comfortable in the chair,

8
00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:36.440
uh,
during this,
at this talk.
Um,

9
00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:43.010
she was presenting the work of her students in the visible language workshop on

10
00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:48.460
immersive interactive computer interface environments.

11
00:00:49.550 --> 00:00:54.230
Uh,
the,
the talk was exceedingly successful,
so much so that apparently Michael,

12
00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:58.700
Bill Gates asked for a copy of the materials afterwards.

13
00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:04.000
It made a big impact in the world of graphic design where I was at the time I

14
00:01:04.641 --> 00:01:09.320
was working out at Ideo in San Francisco and as an interaction designer when

15
00:01:09.321 --> 00:01:11.420
that was a pretty new discipline,

16
00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:16.660
I worked for one of our students and this work was absolutely everywhere in the

17
00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:21.980
intervening years.
I was shocked to see it kind of received from view.
Um,

18
00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:25.370
I think I'll play a little bit of this a video first.

19
00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:31.130
<v 1>Can you hear me?
Yes.
I have a couple of Chris'</v>

20
00:01:33.730 --> 00:01:35.410
philosophy.
First of all,

21
00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:41.090
I'm testing the boundaries to see how truly comfortable when can make oneself

22
00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:42.910
here.

23
00:01:42.910 --> 00:01:46.520
<v 0>And this is another portrait of Muriel Cooper.
This is from 1972.</v>

24
00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:50.000
Um,
this is,
uh,

25
00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:55.060
well it's included in the book and it is captioned in the book as Muriel Cooper

26
00:01:55.431 --> 00:01:59.750
in 1972 at MIT surrounded by unidentified males.

27
00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:05.000
Um,
you see,
again,
she happens to not have on shoes.
Um,

28
00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:06.990
but it's,

29
00:02:07.690 --> 00:02:12.690
it should be clear that this work was done and overwhelmingly male context at

30
00:02:13.221 --> 00:02:17.450
the Massachusetts Institute of Technology where of course,
um,

31
00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:22.490
she had,
uh,
she,
she had a difficult time,
uh,

32
00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:27.800
navigating among the,
uh,
hurdles that were thrown down in front of her,

33
00:02:27.801 --> 00:02:32.780
but she did it with a great skill and aplomb according to those who are around

34
00:02:32.781 --> 00:02:35.060
her.
So,
uh,
I think there's a nice image,

35
00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:38.150
the combination of her sweater and the situation,

36
00:02:38.151 --> 00:02:41.810
the dynamics going on in this image.
Okay.

37
00:02:41.811 --> 00:02:45.740
This is a third portrait.
This is a self portrait of Muriel Cooper.

38
00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:48.470
She's the one on the right in the image.

39
00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:54.880
This was made in 1967 and this was made in the context of a computer aided

40
00:02:55.551 --> 00:03:00.551
design and programming class that Muriel Cooper had a audited at MIT in the

41
00:03:00.731 --> 00:03:02.440
department of mechanical engineering.

42
00:03:02.890 --> 00:03:07.270
This class was taught by Nicholas Negroponte who went on to found the media lab

43
00:03:07.271 --> 00:03:09.070
at Mit.
Um,

44
00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:14.440
this image is made by a computer program as you might guess,

45
00:03:14.710 --> 00:03:19.240
and in fact it's using an alphanumeric printer kind of against itself to turn a

46
00:03:19.241 --> 00:03:21.180
new image making machine.
And we're,

47
00:03:21.181 --> 00:03:26.140
we're well familiar with Ascii art at this point in 1967 considerably less so.

48
00:03:26.350 --> 00:03:28.600
But there's something,
there are a number of qualities about this image,

49
00:03:28.601 --> 00:03:33.280
which I think are typical of why her work is important.
One of which is,

50
00:03:33.580 --> 00:03:38.380
uh,
she had a tendency to kind of use the existing and future looking,
uh,

51
00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:42.880
tools against themselves to find out where the edges are and what,
where,

52
00:03:42.940 --> 00:03:44.620
where it breaks,
what works,

53
00:03:44.621 --> 00:03:47.890
what are the possibilities that haven't been outlined yet.
Um,

54
00:03:48.100 --> 00:03:49.390
the second thing is she's,

55
00:03:49.450 --> 00:03:52.730
she's pictured here together with her good friend Donna,

56
00:03:52.731 --> 00:03:56.560
say Dondis who is also graphic design educator in Boston and a friend,

57
00:03:56.620 --> 00:03:59.480
she studied together with the Mass College of art.
Um,

58
00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:01.300
in many of the images that I may show you,

59
00:04:01.301 --> 00:04:04.750
either Muriel Cooper won't be in them or else she'll be surrounded by other

60
00:04:04.751 --> 00:04:06.610
people.
And I think this is one,

61
00:04:06.700 --> 00:04:11.700
perhaps one reason why her work has relatively disappeared since 1994.

62
00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:15.880
Um,
she,

63
00:04:15.881 --> 00:04:20.881
it doesn't file itself neatly under the kind of a name of a single great author.

64
00:04:21.700 --> 00:04:24.040
In fact,
it's,
it's largely collaborative.
The big,

65
00:04:24.100 --> 00:04:26.380
the purple book is called Muriel Cooper,

66
00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:29.920
but so much of the work inside is not directly her work in whether it's the work

67
00:04:29.921 --> 00:04:30.730
of our students.

68
00:04:30.730 --> 00:04:34.660
It's work that she facilitated by setting up situations and it's work which

69
00:04:34.661 --> 00:04:38.630
jumped over disciplinary boundaries.
So it was kind of hard to file.
Um,

70
00:04:40.690 --> 00:04:44.620
Muriel Cooper worked at Mit,
uh,
for 40 years.

71
00:04:45.100 --> 00:04:47.380
She worked in,
uh,
well it's,

72
00:04:47.381 --> 00:04:51.430
it's easy enough to break down her work into three categories.
Uh,

73
00:04:51.460 --> 00:04:53.950
she first worked in design at MIT,

74
00:04:53.980 --> 00:04:58.390
at the office of publications and then it's the first design director of the MIT

75
00:04:58.391 --> 00:05:01.630
press.
So it was actually design and media director.
Um,

76
00:05:01.720 --> 00:05:06.610
she taught in the school of architecture beginning in 1974,

77
00:05:06.940 --> 00:05:07.361
uh,

78
00:05:07.361 --> 00:05:11.080
instigating a class called messages and means and carrying on establishing the

79
00:05:11.081 --> 00:05:14.740
visible language workshop,
which is a printing and teaching and design workshop.

80
00:05:15.600 --> 00:05:20.410
Uh,
thirdly in 1985,
she was a founding faculty member of the Mit Media Lab,

81
00:05:20.910 --> 00:05:24.010
uh,
found originated by Nicholas Negroponte.

82
00:05:24.011 --> 00:05:28.240
She was one of several of the faculty who organize this facility.

83
00:05:28.241 --> 00:05:30.400
And at that point she was working on computer interfaces.

84
00:05:31.330 --> 00:05:36.330
Now I think if you probably asked her to think about those three words,

85
00:05:36.491 --> 00:05:39.280
I think it would look something much more like this.
Um,

86
00:05:40.090 --> 00:05:43.840
kind of all one activity.
They were never a discreet,
and in fact,

87
00:05:43.841 --> 00:05:47.770
when she was working on books it,
the MIT press,

88
00:05:47.771 --> 00:05:51.940
she was thinking about how they might appear on screen or when she was,
uh,

89
00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:55.390
making a film of a book that I'll show later.
Uh,

90
00:05:55.391 --> 00:05:58.220
she was thinking about how she might show that students and so there's this kind

91
00:05:58.221 --> 00:06:03.221
of re overlapping and a recursive feedback loop between these activities.

92
00:06:03.890 --> 00:06:06.920
However,
for ease of communicating the story,

93
00:06:06.921 --> 00:06:09.530
we're going to leave it in it's three parts,
so I'll start in design.

94
00:06:11.710 --> 00:06:16.270
In 1962,
the technology press,
which was MIT,

95
00:06:16.271 --> 00:06:17.620
is in house publishing.

96
00:06:17.950 --> 00:06:22.950
I was switching their name to the MIT press and the director of the press

97
00:06:23.021 --> 00:06:24.370
consulted with Paul Rand,

98
00:06:24.371 --> 00:06:28.590
a well known American graphic designer at the time and asked uh,

99
00:06:29.920 --> 00:06:33.250
if he might consider doing their logo.
He said maybe he can't do it,

100
00:06:33.251 --> 00:06:37.300
but he could recommend some people.
He recommend Muriel Cooper to do it.
Okay.

101
00:06:37.301 --> 00:06:40.780
This is not the logo for the MIT press that Muriel Cooper designed.

102
00:06:41.200 --> 00:06:45.880
This one is also not the logo for MIT press that Muriel Cooper designed.

103
00:06:46.240 --> 00:06:50.500
Also not a logo for MIT press.
These were all proposals that Muriel Cooper made.

104
00:06:50.740 --> 00:06:55.570
She was working as a freelance designer on this assignment.
Another,

105
00:06:55.660 --> 00:06:57.700
I think this could have been a great logo for MIT press,

106
00:06:57.701 --> 00:07:00.670
but it was not the one that she designed.
Finally,

107
00:07:00.671 --> 00:07:04.780
this one's getting a bit closer to what eventually became one of her best known

108
00:07:04.781 --> 00:07:06.490
works.
And in fact,

109
00:07:06.491 --> 00:07:11.430
when I started digging through what exists in the Muriel Cooper Archive at

110
00:07:11.450 --> 00:07:12.850
Massachusetts College of Art,

111
00:07:12.851 --> 00:07:15.790
which is a bunch of bankers boxes with mixed materials in there,

112
00:07:16.120 --> 00:07:21.120
inside of one I found among Reebok high tops and VHS tapes and sheets of slides,

113
00:07:22.271 --> 00:07:25.870
I found that kind of crumpled up piece of a sketch paper.

114
00:07:26.140 --> 00:07:29.440
And on that paper I recognize down at the bottom,
uh,

115
00:07:29.441 --> 00:07:34.300
what would become the MIT press logo that's existed for 50 years by this point,

116
00:07:34.301 --> 00:07:37.240
which would indicate some something about it success.

117
00:07:37.450 --> 00:07:42.220
You see the lines here are the set of books drawn acts and symmetrically on a

118
00:07:42.221 --> 00:07:46.840
shelf with the fifth one pulled up in the sixth one,
pulled down a,

119
00:07:46.841 --> 00:07:49.900
here's the final version of that.
Uh,

120
00:07:49.901 --> 00:07:54.370
if you kind of squint your eyes or raise your,
raise your bar for abstraction,

121
00:07:54.580 --> 00:07:57.760
you'll see MITP,
which I'm sure we all see.
Um,

122
00:07:58.510 --> 00:08:03.400
I think this is one of my favorite pieces of graphic design period.
Uh,

123
00:08:03.401 --> 00:08:07.550
for a number of reasons.
One of which is,
um,
is I,

124
00:08:07.551 --> 00:08:09.000
I suppose,
uh,

125
00:08:10.270 --> 00:08:15.130
the fact that it has existed for 50 years,
um,
is a qualifier.

126
00:08:15.131 --> 00:08:18.280
But I like the fact that it looks,
it's a static graphic,

127
00:08:18.281 --> 00:08:20.500
but it looks like it's machine readable.

128
00:08:21.160 --> 00:08:22.610
It looks like this is meant to be a barcode.

129
00:08:22.750 --> 00:08:27.250
And something about that kind of equation in 19,
uh,
64 by this point,

130
00:08:27.550 --> 00:08:28.120
uh,

131
00:08:28.120 --> 00:08:33.120
that equation of books and publishing with electronic information and machine

132
00:08:33.731 --> 00:08:34.301
readability,

133
00:08:34.301 --> 00:08:38.560
I think that's a super strong insight and typical of why I think our work's

134
00:08:38.590 --> 00:08:39.423
important.

135
00:08:40.500 --> 00:08:41.333
<v 2>Okay.</v>

136
00:08:41.990 --> 00:08:43.120
<v 0>By 1967,</v>

137
00:08:43.130 --> 00:08:48.080
she became the first design and media director of the MIT press at the MIT
press.

138
00:08:48.081 --> 00:08:49.420
She was overseeing a,

139
00:08:49.830 --> 00:08:54.830
a ambitious publishing program that involved books like this book,

140
00:08:55.381 --> 00:08:56.610
which is a,
um,

141
00:08:57.390 --> 00:09:02.390
a collection of the papers delivered at a technical conference or this book,

142
00:09:03.241 --> 00:09:07.620
which is by Seymour Papert and Marvin Minsky,
also cofounders of the media lab.

143
00:09:07.990 --> 00:09:12.480
Um,
a book about computational geometry,
um,
or this book,

144
00:09:12.481 --> 00:09:16.530
which is written by Nicholas Negroponte called the architecture machine,
um,

145
00:09:17.010 --> 00:09:20.820
which was around early attempts to apply,
um,

146
00:09:20.850 --> 00:09:25.200
computers and software to architectural design.
Um,
there is a,

147
00:09:25.380 --> 00:09:26.520
uh,

148
00:09:27.060 --> 00:09:30.660
it was an ambitious and important publishing program that she was dealing with.

149
00:09:31.290 --> 00:09:34.950
A,
this is another book that she designed while at MIT press.

150
00:09:35.020 --> 00:09:38.520
This is called Bauhaus Weimar desalle Berlin.

151
00:09:38.521 --> 00:09:43.200
Chicago was published in 1969.
It's a big book.
As meg mentioned,

152
00:09:43.201 --> 00:09:46.140
it's the same size as the purple thing on the table over there.

153
00:09:46.140 --> 00:09:48.960
It's about 14 inches tall.
I'm hardback book.

154
00:09:48.961 --> 00:09:52.690
It was originally published in German and translated into English.
Um,

155
00:09:52.770 --> 00:09:57.720
this book was of special importance to Muriel Cooper,
um,
the bow house,

156
00:09:57.721 --> 00:10:02.721
a important design school in Germany and transferring to the United States,

157
00:10:03.180 --> 00:10:05.200
uh,
uh,

158
00:10:05.250 --> 00:10:08.280
that mixed hands on production and uh,

159
00:10:08.281 --> 00:10:12.090
teaching and design and kind of overlapping ways.
It was a,

160
00:10:12.150 --> 00:10:15.090
she considered that her,
uh,

161
00:10:15.450 --> 00:10:18.960
principal point of departure for her teaching and her designing and her work.

162
00:10:19.500 --> 00:10:23.490
She spent two years working designing this book.
The book included,

163
00:10:23.700 --> 00:10:28.350
I'm Scilla by and correspondence and documentation of this essential,
um,

164
00:10:28.680 --> 00:10:33.680
design school that originated around the industrial revolution.

165
00:10:33.691 --> 00:10:38.610
And um,
this is the first edition was popular,

166
00:10:38.611 --> 00:10:42.330
a second edition,
a slightly smaller paper back here.

167
00:10:42.331 --> 00:10:47.190
She used the offset printing process,
which uses Cyan,
Magenta and yellow,

168
00:10:47.490 --> 00:10:51.420
uh,
in overlapping,
uh,
over printing forms to um,

169
00:10:52.260 --> 00:10:56.310
to produce all the,
a four color full color images here.

170
00:10:56.310 --> 00:10:58.020
She just shifts the printing plates.

171
00:10:58.200 --> 00:11:03.200
And what you're left with is a distinctive graphic that's a index of the process

172
00:11:03.631 --> 00:11:05.280
or register or the process that made it.

173
00:11:05.580 --> 00:11:07.740
And I think this is typical in our work as well.

174
00:11:07.741 --> 00:11:10.860
And something else that certainly drew me to it.
Um,
it,

175
00:11:10.920 --> 00:11:14.670
it's as focused on the process as it is on the product,

176
00:11:14.880 --> 00:11:19.140
but not as an end,
not in order to get a strange or different product,

177
00:11:19.350 --> 00:11:23.640
but more as a kind of equivalency between these things.
Um,

178
00:11:24.120 --> 00:11:28.350
the Bauhaus,
the Bauhaus was no a distraction to Muriel Cooper at this time.

179
00:11:28.351 --> 00:11:29.910
And Cambridge,
um,

180
00:11:30.210 --> 00:11:34.770
Lazlo Moholy knowledge who was at the Bauhaus had come to Chicago to set up the

181
00:11:34.771 --> 00:11:35.490
new Bauhaus,

182
00:11:35.490 --> 00:11:38.370
which became the Illinois Institute of Technology Institute of design.

183
00:11:38.550 --> 00:11:42.720
He brought with them the Yorkie Kapish who went on to head the,
um,

184
00:11:42.750 --> 00:11:47.730
school in Chicago and then came to MIT and kapish brought Muriel Cooper into

185
00:11:47.760 --> 00:11:49.780
work originally at the office of publications.

186
00:11:49.780 --> 00:11:51.870
So this is a direct lineage there as well.

187
00:11:51.871 --> 00:11:54.670
Walter Gropius who is running the bow house.

188
00:11:54.671 --> 00:11:58.000
Previously it was down Massachusetts Avenue running the Graduate School of

189
00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:00.820
design at Harvard.
So this was a,
there was a direct connection.

190
00:12:00.821 --> 00:12:05.821
It was not looking from a distance when this book was done two years lavished of

191
00:12:07.361 --> 00:12:11.590
time on it.
Um,
the MIT press did something that was kind of a surprising,

192
00:12:11.800 --> 00:12:14.280
they launched a publicity campaign,
um,

193
00:12:14.470 --> 00:12:19.360
to announce and promote this important book.
And for that,

194
00:12:19.361 --> 00:12:21.100
for example,
they designed a letterhead.

195
00:12:21.101 --> 00:12:24.850
I mean you're all Cooper designed to letterhead.
Uh,
they also designed posters.

196
00:12:24.851 --> 00:12:27.250
This is like a 36 inch poster,

197
00:12:27.280 --> 00:12:29.710
giant blowup with that self portrait of Moholy nudge.

198
00:12:30.010 --> 00:12:34.780
But where the halftone screen is exaggerated to call attention to the kind of

199
00:12:34.781 --> 00:12:38.200
mode of production that,
uh,
that this is using.

200
00:12:38.500 --> 00:12:43.500
And it's strange to imagine that you might design and publish a poster to sell

201
00:12:44.351 --> 00:12:47.710
books.
Um,
I'm not sure how many books it sold,

202
00:12:47.711 --> 00:12:52.450
but this is the kind of a play that was going on I think often within Cooper's

203
00:12:52.451 --> 00:12:56.790
work.
It's a second poster she designed same size.
Uh,

204
00:12:56.800 --> 00:13:01.660
this includes every,
every spread in the book,
but this was done analog.

205
00:13:01.661 --> 00:13:05.590
So each one of those is a piece of film and reduced to fit on this,

206
00:13:05.620 --> 00:13:09.310
on this large format here we see a kind of detail and I expect what she was

207
00:13:09.311 --> 00:13:13.960
hoping to get to from this was to imagine what it would be like to kind of

208
00:13:13.961 --> 00:13:17.620
simultaneously understand this book,
um,

209
00:13:17.621 --> 00:13:22.270
to see the images that are kind of a more exaggerated speed than what we're used

210
00:13:22.271 --> 00:13:26.050
to at this moment.
It's a way to kind of interrogate,
to prod the media.

211
00:13:26.980 --> 00:13:30.460
Um,
when she finished the book,
she did something else.

212
00:13:30.490 --> 00:13:35.490
She made a film of the book where she spent,

213
00:13:36.070 --> 00:13:39.670
uh,
three frames for every spread in the book,

214
00:13:39.880 --> 00:13:43.000
made a 16 millimeter film,
which I'm going to let play right here.

215
00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:47.140
This is a recreation of the film that was made for the exhibition that meg

216
00:13:47.141 --> 00:13:51.760
mentioned at Columbia,
organized by Robert Watson Burger and myself.
Um,

217
00:13:53.050 --> 00:13:58.050
what you see here is the material of the book flowing through the page grid or

218
00:13:58.211 --> 00:14:01.930
kind of template of that determines its design.

219
00:14:02.380 --> 00:14:05.890
And she was already talking about the fact that once digital information was

220
00:14:05.891 --> 00:14:06.724
more prevalent,

221
00:14:06.850 --> 00:14:11.620
it would come too fast and we'd need templates and ways to automate the,

222
00:14:11.770 --> 00:14:13.240
the presentation of that material.

223
00:14:13.241 --> 00:14:18.241
And this is a different idea than what existed working in a press and on,

224
00:14:18.940 --> 00:14:19.690
on books.

225
00:14:19.690 --> 00:14:23.500
She also made this film in order to show her students to get them to think about

226
00:14:23.501 --> 00:14:27.820
the way that a grid plays out over time.
Okay.
Finally,

227
00:14:28.140 --> 00:14:32.710
uh,
in 1979,
MIT press organized an exhibition called books 2000.

228
00:14:32.750 --> 00:14:35.290
Looking forward to what books would be in the year of 2000.

229
00:14:35.590 --> 00:14:38.710
And she was asked to put the bow house book in there and this is what she

230
00:14:39.040 --> 00:14:42.850
offered,
which was the raw manuscript of the book and that stood in place.

231
00:14:42.851 --> 00:14:47.200
Football coach,
I love it.
Kind of amazing.
Uh,
so just a stack of papers.

232
00:14:47.201 --> 00:14:48.580
The original typewritten manuscript,

233
00:14:50.380 --> 00:14:53.240
some of the other books that were passing through the press at the time include

234
00:14:53.241 --> 00:14:56.960
a primer of visual literacy by Don,
say Dondis who we saw on this self portrait,

235
00:14:57.050 --> 00:14:58.940
a Ascii art.
Um,

236
00:14:59.030 --> 00:15:03.220
this is a graphic design textbook and his 33rd printing and other book is five

237
00:15:03.221 --> 00:15:04.100
lender architecture,

238
00:15:04.101 --> 00:15:06.950
which she did with Herbert Muschamp who became the architecture critic of the

239
00:15:06.951 --> 00:15:07.784
New York Times.

240
00:15:08.270 --> 00:15:12.800
This book was produced with a IBM Selectric typewriter to do the type setting

241
00:15:12.860 --> 00:15:16.880
for it.
Um,
she published this book,
uh,

242
00:15:17.120 --> 00:15:21.200
companion for Lydia illiterates by a Swiss designer and artists,
Carl Gerstner.

243
00:15:21.410 --> 00:15:25.880
It was around,
um,
texts and typography as a kind of graphic event,
um,

244
00:15:26.390 --> 00:15:29.480
translated into English.
Now at the MIT press,

245
00:15:29.481 --> 00:15:34.430
there were too many books as well to give much attention to every book.

246
00:15:34.640 --> 00:15:38.300
And so a large part of what she did was think through the publishing and design

247
00:15:38.301 --> 00:15:42.290
system that existed there.
And she developed pages and pages as far as we could.

248
00:15:42.350 --> 00:15:45.780
Um,
Robert and I could discern,
uh,

249
00:15:46.140 --> 00:15:48.200
and pages and pages of,
uh,

250
00:15:49.490 --> 00:15:52.010
schemes for how books would pass through the press.

251
00:15:52.011 --> 00:15:55.610
So here's a pretty legible one that begins with,
uh,

252
00:15:55.640 --> 00:15:59.300
from easy to complicated,
uh,
from camera ready,

253
00:15:59.301 --> 00:16:04.301
too difficult and they would engage different amounts of kind of design and

254
00:16:04.491 --> 00:16:08.720
layout and uh,
editing production resources within the press.

255
00:16:09.170 --> 00:16:12.890
And the result of that was that a rather high level of design across all the

256
00:16:12.891 --> 00:16:13.220
books,

257
00:16:13.220 --> 00:16:17.900
even books that were proceeding proceedings from a academic conferences like

258
00:16:17.901 --> 00:16:22.550
this one 36 lectures at the biology would still have a strong high level of

259
00:16:22.551 --> 00:16:26.240
design on them.
And this is what made the program says strong.
Uh,

260
00:16:26.270 --> 00:16:28.850
here's a computer software manual.

261
00:16:28.851 --> 00:16:31.790
Here's another software manual where we're computer,

262
00:16:31.791 --> 00:16:36.230
where typewriter type is simply blown up to make the cover.
Um,

263
00:16:36.260 --> 00:16:40.430
and finally,
here's a,
a last book I'm going to show.
It's not unimportant.

264
00:16:40.431 --> 00:16:43.340
The subject matter of the books that were coming through the press cause she was

265
00:16:43.341 --> 00:16:47.000
engaging with this material on reading it and this helped,
helped,
uh,

266
00:16:47.760 --> 00:16:51.860
arrange her move into her next kind of phase within MIT

267
00:16:54.770 --> 00:16:58.430
in 1974.
Muriel Cooper was,

268
00:16:58.630 --> 00:17:01.640
was introduced to Ron Mcneil.

269
00:17:01.940 --> 00:17:04.940
Ron was a photographic assistant at Mit.

270
00:17:05.060 --> 00:17:09.260
Ron had a four color offset press,

271
00:17:09.410 --> 00:17:12.020
which is a large printing press,
um,

272
00:17:12.230 --> 00:17:16.700
about half the size of the stage I would guess.
And Ah,

273
00:17:16.701 --> 00:17:20.870
there they immediately made a connection and thought it'd be amazing to teach a

274
00:17:20.871 --> 00:17:24.440
class around this press where students were not only learning about design but

275
00:17:24.441 --> 00:17:28.050
actually making the printed work and learning about how to run a printer and et

276
00:17:28.060 --> 00:17:29.330
cetera.
Um,

277
00:17:29.360 --> 00:17:34.360
they began teaching a class in the department of architecture at MIT called

278
00:17:34.701 --> 00:17:39.350
messages and means this was the original poster which announced that class.
Um,

279
00:17:39.440 --> 00:17:44.360
that class,
uh,
this poster was made in a,

280
00:17:44.361 --> 00:17:48.060
using a method that she gave as an assignment often,
uh,

281
00:17:48.080 --> 00:17:53.080
which was to use the same printing plate and overprint my rotating the,

282
00:17:54.000 --> 00:17:56.580
the sheet of paper each time it goes through the press.

283
00:17:56.581 --> 00:18:00.930
So you get kind of overlapping a rotated images on top of each other.

284
00:18:01.770 --> 00:18:05.070
The press was also,
I mean the,
the,

285
00:18:05.370 --> 00:18:08.100
that offset press presses also used to print posters for events that are

286
00:18:08.101 --> 00:18:12.070
happening to MIT.
For example,
this,
uh,

287
00:18:12.180 --> 00:18:15.390
which is the Macra,
the mechanical artwork,

288
00:18:15.510 --> 00:18:20.510
the film actually for this poster which was announcing a traveling art

289
00:18:20.821 --> 00:18:23.570
exhibition originating at,
uh,
MIT.

290
00:18:25.770 --> 00:18:29.670
Here are a group of students gathered around the press and messages and means,

291
00:18:29.950 --> 00:18:30.783
um,

292
00:18:30.870 --> 00:18:35.610
I found this image some way into the kind of meandering research process and I

293
00:18:35.611 --> 00:18:38.580
was really happy to see that asterisk poster up,
uh,

294
00:18:38.610 --> 00:18:42.750
behind in the top left of this image.
Um,

295
00:18:43.570 --> 00:18:48.310
uh,
which was a nice loop back to finding the real thing.
Originally,
uh,

296
00:18:48.330 --> 00:18:51.180
the students were involved handed on printing.
I mean,

297
00:18:51.181 --> 00:18:55.410
you can imagine this might be a maybe a liability nightmare and today's a

298
00:18:55.411 --> 00:18:59.850
university,
but it was not at the time.
Um,
there is uh,

299
00:19:00.030 --> 00:19:01.470
both a hands on,

300
00:19:01.530 --> 00:19:06.530
there's a do it yourself ethic that was there was also manifested in the

301
00:19:07.201 --> 00:19:08.850
assignments and the way that the students work.

302
00:19:08.851 --> 00:19:10.920
They apparently kept all hours in this space and

303
00:19:13.440 --> 00:19:16.860
as well what they're doing in there,
they're doing it self consciously.
So here,

304
00:19:16.861 --> 00:19:20.220
this is Ron Mcneil and the center of this image and he's working with the offset

305
00:19:20.221 --> 00:19:24.570
press and a cleaning it up or adjusting something.

306
00:19:24.720 --> 00:19:25.531
And while he's doing that,

307
00:19:25.531 --> 00:19:29.700
he's being recorded video recorded on a Sony Portapak video camera,

308
00:19:29.880 --> 00:19:32.760
which would be brand new at this point.
It recorded in black and white.

309
00:19:32.761 --> 00:19:37.170
It was handheld,
completely radical,
um,
image making technology.

310
00:19:37.320 --> 00:19:39.430
And then all of this is being recorded by somebody with a,

311
00:19:39.560 --> 00:19:43.380
with the camera at 35 millimeter camera from the other side.
So there's absolute,

312
00:19:43.381 --> 00:19:45.480
although they were hands on making this,

313
00:19:45.481 --> 00:19:50.481
they're also aware that what they're doing was interesting or worth the worth

314
00:19:51.001 --> 00:19:55.380
thinking about.
Anyway,
worth representing
the messages.

315
00:19:55.381 --> 00:19:57.900
Means class was,
was overwhelmingly popular.

316
00:19:57.960 --> 00:20:02.070
And the next year a Mcneil and Cooper founded,
uh,

317
00:20:02.100 --> 00:20:05.190
autonomous center within the school of Architecture called the visible language

318
00:20:05.191 --> 00:20:07.740
workshop.
Uh,
it was centered around the printing press.

319
00:20:07.741 --> 00:20:12.320
They offered a couple of additional classes and this became more what Muriel

320
00:20:12.320 --> 00:20:14.400
Cooper was spending the bulk of her days doing.

321
00:20:14.760 --> 00:20:19.510
This is a dummy for the letterhead for the visible language workshop.
Um,

322
00:20:19.860 --> 00:20:24.330
what you see here is ears,
a printed version of it.
Uh,

323
00:20:24.331 --> 00:20:27.990
what you see is a kind of ham fisted,
um,

324
00:20:28.350 --> 00:20:33.130
a brush stroke but then which is filled in with the split fill,

325
00:20:33.660 --> 00:20:37.620
split fountain printing process that Grady aids from,
from red to blue.

326
00:20:37.621 --> 00:20:39.810
And it's a what?
It's something you can get to only do on the press.

327
00:20:39.811 --> 00:20:44.070
That's why this mockup only shows that kind of working like this.
Um,
and again,

328
00:20:44.071 --> 00:20:48.340
I think it's typical thinking designed through it's kind of production,
uh,

329
00:20:48.550 --> 00:20:51.800
needs here.
Uh,
another version that letterhead,
uh,

330
00:20:51.880 --> 00:20:54.250
that letter had as well reproduced well on a,

331
00:20:54.340 --> 00:20:57.430
on a xerox machine and in fact they offered a class and visible language

332
00:20:57.431 --> 00:20:59.140
workshop called electrostatics,

333
00:20:59.350 --> 00:21:02.890
which was about xerox machines because this was a new image making technology.

334
00:21:03.070 --> 00:21:07.420
It had the quality of making immediate prince,
you could work on it,

335
00:21:07.421 --> 00:21:10.690
change your mind,
make another thing,
change your mind,
work on it.

336
00:21:10.930 --> 00:21:15.930
And this kind of quick feedback loop was something she was always desiring of

337
00:21:16.511 --> 00:21:20.470
the kind of graphic tools she was working with.
In 1980,

338
00:21:20.800 --> 00:21:25.800
Muriel Cooper and Ron Mcneil were asked to submit an article for Department of

339
00:21:25.840 --> 00:21:27.400
Architecture in House Journal called plan.

340
00:21:27.970 --> 00:21:31.420
And the that was supposed to be about like what's going on in the visible

341
00:21:31.421 --> 00:21:36.421
language workshop and instead of responding with the set of images or student

342
00:21:37.001 --> 00:21:41.880
works or something like this,
a Cooper decided to um,

343
00:21:42.990 --> 00:21:43.870
respond in different ways.

344
00:21:43.871 --> 00:21:47.140
So this is actually the first page of the article and uh,

345
00:21:47.141 --> 00:21:51.400
this was a letter back to the editor and the letter said,
um,

346
00:21:51.460 --> 00:21:54.340
I'm going to read a little couple of excerpts from it.
She says,

347
00:21:54.341 --> 00:21:57.460
we're not going to give you an image,
an article with a collection of images,

348
00:21:57.480 --> 00:22:01.480
images of student work in,
uh,
instead,
uh,

349
00:22:01.720 --> 00:22:06.100
the following are the article will fulfill the following criteria.
Number one,

350
00:22:06.101 --> 00:22:08.470
it would make use of the tools,
processes,

351
00:22:08.471 --> 00:22:12.190
and technologies of graphic arts media as directly as possible.

352
00:22:12.610 --> 00:22:16.870
And tools would be integrated with concept and product.
Number two,

353
00:22:17.440 --> 00:22:21.820
the author would be the maker contrary to the specialization mode,

354
00:22:21.821 --> 00:22:24.910
which makes the author of the content,
the author,
the author of the form,

355
00:22:24.911 --> 00:22:26.380
the designer,
and the author of the craft,

356
00:22:26.381 --> 00:22:31.220
the topographer or printer number three,
visual and verbal representation.

357
00:22:31.221 --> 00:22:35.560
And the idea would be synthesized rather than separate.
And number four,

358
00:22:35.561 --> 00:22:36.400
this is the important one.

359
00:22:36.401 --> 00:22:40.420
I think time would remain as fluid and immediate as possible.

360
00:22:41.080 --> 00:22:43.060
Leaving room for feedback and change.

361
00:22:43.360 --> 00:22:47.530
She signs off the letter and it kind of a beautiful turn of phrase.
She says,

362
00:22:47.710 --> 00:22:50.680
well this stands as a sketch for the future and signs it.

363
00:22:51.730 --> 00:22:54.460
Here's a spread from inside that article.
There's several spreads.

364
00:22:54.700 --> 00:22:58.990
They were a black and white high contrast images just as described in that,

365
00:22:59.170 --> 00:23:01.360
in that text they were made in the workshop.

366
00:23:02.890 --> 00:23:06.060
Now on doing the research,
um,

367
00:23:06.640 --> 00:23:11.500
I was really excited to come across this a page,

368
00:23:11.740 --> 00:23:14.380
which is actually a mocked up,

369
00:23:14.490 --> 00:23:18.970
a revised version of the letter that she eventually printed as the first page of

370
00:23:18.971 --> 00:23:21.790
that article that are,
that letter was supposed to look off the cuff,
right?

371
00:23:22.150 --> 00:23:24.010
But of course she worked at a,

372
00:23:24.011 --> 00:23:26.980
and so here are her own corrections and notes on that.

373
00:23:26.981 --> 00:23:31.900
And if you even get up to the top left,
you see it says a sketch if you will,

374
00:23:31.901 --> 00:23:34.690
for the future.
Um,
and I think this document,

375
00:23:34.691 --> 00:23:39.610
it's kind of markups and changes and feedback and different overlaps of a

376
00:23:39.640 --> 00:23:43.820
printing and production technologies within it.
Um,
are uh,

377
00:23:43.840 --> 00:23:47.150
kind of good way to read a lot of the intent in or other work.

378
00:23:47.920 --> 00:23:48.753
<v 2>Okay.</v>

379
00:23:50.060 --> 00:23:53.300
<v 0>No visible language workshop was not just printing presses at the time.</v>

380
00:23:53.301 --> 00:23:56.420
Even from 1974 there is photographic,

381
00:23:56.421 --> 00:24:00.950
there's a dark room and photographic equipment like a large format.
Xerox camera.

382
00:24:01.430 --> 00:24:02.060
Um,

383
00:24:02.060 --> 00:24:06.740
there was as well a Prodo Photoshop that Ron McNeil had developed with a

384
00:24:06.770 --> 00:24:07.700
engineering students.

385
00:24:07.701 --> 00:24:12.701
It was called sis and it allowed direct a pixel by Pixel manipulation of digital

386
00:24:13.371 --> 00:24:17.390
images.
This is something completely radical at the time.
Uh,

387
00:24:17.391 --> 00:24:21.380
here's Ron sitting in front of CIS,
a cis as well.
I had what they call it,

388
00:24:21.381 --> 00:24:24.650
a scanner,
which is really a digital camera to get images into the system.

389
00:24:24.920 --> 00:24:27.740
And it also included a large format inkjet printer,

390
00:24:27.741 --> 00:24:31.240
which he called the billboard plotter,
which you see beyond him.
Um,

391
00:24:31.370 --> 00:24:35.000
I think this image gives some idea of the kind of what it was like in the

392
00:24:35.001 --> 00:24:37.310
workshop workshop was a series of three rooms,

393
00:24:37.550 --> 00:24:41.570
a mix of analog and digital technologies and kind of no boundaries between these

394
00:24:41.571 --> 00:24:44.360
things.
Lots of activity as far as I could understand,

395
00:24:46.410 --> 00:24:51.180
but it was all towards an end of making a responsive,

396
00:24:51.270 --> 00:24:54.810
uh,
iterative graphic tools for image making.

397
00:24:55.050 --> 00:24:58.080
So here's a diagram,
perhaps notional,
uh,

398
00:24:58.110 --> 00:25:01.170
the electronic equipment that was in the visible language workshop and the way

399
00:25:01.171 --> 00:25:06.030
it,
the way it went together,
it included,
for example,
a $500,000,
uh,

400
00:25:06.060 --> 00:25:10.440
Perkin Elmer computer,
um,
300 megabyte disk drive,

401
00:25:10.530 --> 00:25:11.430
so on and so forth.

402
00:25:13.450 --> 00:25:18.330
Now a Cooper made this image using a collection of that,
uh,

403
00:25:18.370 --> 00:25:20.170
image making material.

404
00:25:20.530 --> 00:25:25.090
Now this image was the two images that are of Muriel Cooper here.

405
00:25:25.370 --> 00:25:29.680
W started out as video images made 1974 captured on Sony Porta pack.

406
00:25:30.100 --> 00:25:34.900
Those images were digitized into and assists into that electronic,

407
00:25:34.901 --> 00:25:36.580
a image manipulation software.

408
00:25:36.910 --> 00:25:41.910
They were then 10 years later transmitted down the hall at Mit from one room to

409
00:25:43.181 --> 00:25:44.680
another ever something on a slow scan.

410
00:25:44.681 --> 00:25:46.600
Transmission was did they to a color facts,

411
00:25:46.750 --> 00:25:50.890
same way they sent images from the moon and then finally those images were

412
00:25:50.891 --> 00:25:55.750
displayed on a pair of stacked monitors and then that that whole contraption was

413
00:25:55.751 --> 00:25:57.520
photographed with a 30 by 40 inch,

414
00:25:57.550 --> 00:26:02.050
very large a Polaroid camera to give you this image where you see like the

415
00:26:02.051 --> 00:26:04.510
chemical peel of the instant Polaroid.

416
00:26:04.511 --> 00:26:07.930
You see the scan lines from the a CRT monitors,

417
00:26:08.110 --> 00:26:12.490
you see Muriel Cooper wearing a Polaroid camera and SX 70 which would have been

418
00:26:12.491 --> 00:26:16.960
brand new in 1974 around her neck and in fact it's even replacing one of her

419
00:26:16.961 --> 00:26:19.120
eyes and the best,

420
00:26:19.180 --> 00:26:23.500
the thing I liked the most about it is the fact that in one image she's making a

421
00:26:23.501 --> 00:26:26.350
photograph of the person taking the video of her in the next image.

422
00:26:26.350 --> 00:26:28.960
That image is out of her camera or getting ready to develop.

423
00:26:28.961 --> 00:26:30.880
And if we could just,
just out of frame,

424
00:26:30.881 --> 00:26:33.740
we'd see the person who was actually recording and which I never figured out who

425
00:26:33.890 --> 00:26:37.090
we never figured out who it was.
In 1985,

426
00:26:37.570 --> 00:26:41.630
Muriel Cooper was asked by Nicholas Negroponte,
um,

427
00:26:42.400 --> 00:26:47.340
who was in the department of architecture and he was founding the media lab at

428
00:26:47.341 --> 00:26:52.341
Mit and Muriel Cooper was invited as one of the founding faculty to establish,

429
00:26:52.940 --> 00:26:56.640
um,
a research unit within it.
Now,

430
00:26:57.450 --> 00:27:00.240
what I understand from the invitation was that,
uh,

431
00:27:00.300 --> 00:27:03.540
she was asked to consider giving her group a new name,

432
00:27:03.541 --> 00:27:07.970
not the visible language workshop.
She steadfastly refused.
She said,
you know,

433
00:27:07.971 --> 00:27:10.470
it's even though we're going to be working on computer interfaces,

434
00:27:10.471 --> 00:27:11.760
like it's the same.

435
00:27:12.000 --> 00:27:16.560
It's the same concerns that I've been thinking about both at MIT press and with

436
00:27:16.561 --> 00:27:18.720
the teaching.
It's all the same thing.

437
00:27:18.730 --> 00:27:23.070
So she insisted on continuing the visible language workshop name.
Now,

438
00:27:23.071 --> 00:27:27.900
the Mit Media Lab,
uh,
was as Negroponte described it.

439
00:27:28.590 --> 00:27:29.423
Uh,

440
00:27:29.670 --> 00:27:33.510
if the bow house was a design school for the industrial age and then the media

441
00:27:33.511 --> 00:27:38.290
lab was to be a design school for the information age.
I'm here.
We see,
uh,

442
00:27:38.640 --> 00:27:40.380
here's an inside of one of the rooms.

443
00:27:40.590 --> 00:27:45.390
It was in a new building designed by I m Pei on the campus of Mit.

444
00:27:45.680 --> 00:27:47.440
Um,
it,
uh,

445
00:27:47.520 --> 00:27:52.520
consisted of a stacked floors of drop ceiling spaces with lots of CRT monitors

446
00:27:54.120 --> 00:27:55.290
here and their carpet,

447
00:27:55.330 --> 00:27:59.460
etc. Here's Muriel Cooper and Ron Mcneil in the space of the visible light of

448
00:27:59.461 --> 00:28:02.940
the visible language workshop at the media lab.
Uh,

449
00:28:02.941 --> 00:28:04.140
when they moved into the space,

450
00:28:04.141 --> 00:28:07.620
they originally insisted that there would be heavy power in order to bring in

451
00:28:07.621 --> 00:28:11.790
the printing presses,
but they got so interested in the,
um,

452
00:28:11.820 --> 00:28:15.720
in the screens that they never brought in any of the analog printing material.

453
00:28:16.290 --> 00:28:18.090
Some of the work they were doing,

454
00:28:18.091 --> 00:28:22.470
their included reports such as this proposal called books without pages,

455
00:28:22.740 --> 00:28:27.510
which imagines what it would mean to have a,
uh,
type on the screen essentially.

456
00:28:27.930 --> 00:28:32.480
Um,
it includes um,
ideas about page flipping interfaces,
um,

457
00:28:32.550 --> 00:28:36.210
dynamic text,
which communicates by the way that it changes over time.

458
00:28:36.330 --> 00:28:39.660
They were working with a space at the media lab called the media room,

459
00:28:39.661 --> 00:28:44.661
which was an immersive media environment all centered around an Eames lounger

460
00:28:44.791 --> 00:28:49.200
chair and which included a projected wall size,
a interface,

461
00:28:49.201 --> 00:28:53.730
a smaller touchscreen interface,
uh,
trackpads built into the um,

462
00:28:53.960 --> 00:28:57.720
and built into the arms of the chair.
And uh,

463
00:28:57.721 --> 00:29:01.000
the interfaces as well.
I had qualities that we,

464
00:29:01.100 --> 00:29:05.580
when we can recognize now like skeuomorphic forms of the objects of these things

465
00:29:05.581 --> 00:29:09.000
were meant to replicate.
I want to play a little bit,

466
00:29:09.001 --> 00:29:11.940
this is a short clip of some of the research that was going on at,

467
00:29:12.060 --> 00:29:14.400
at the visible language workshop at the time.

468
00:29:15.590 --> 00:29:20.060
<v 1>There are two very important things that the visible language workshop is,</v>

469
00:29:20.090 --> 00:29:21.170
is looking at.

470
00:29:21.650 --> 00:29:26.390
One is the way in which graphics,

471
00:29:26.391 --> 00:29:31.070
which we defined in the broadest sense can be used to filter,

472
00:29:31.071 --> 00:29:35.630
define,
qualify and edit that information.
And secondly,

473
00:29:35.631 --> 00:29:40.631
what the interface for the relationship at the surface or the access of the

474
00:29:41.771 --> 00:29:46.771
person to the machine can be white to promote the most creative and the most

475
00:29:47.291 --> 00:29:49.120
generative means of communication.

476
00:29:49.660 --> 00:29:53.870
It's a major concern at the VFW is determining ways in which one can relate to

477
00:29:53.871 --> 00:29:57.850
as a computer much in the same manner as you went to a friend or an assistant.

478
00:29:58.290 --> 00:29:59.890
Uh,
in the short run.

479
00:29:59.950 --> 00:30:04.950
What would be good to do is study ways in which rules can be modeled to the

480
00:30:08.561 --> 00:30:09.190
machine.

481
00:30:09.190 --> 00:30:14.190
So the machine will then begin to assume some of the responsibility for work,

482
00:30:15.521 --> 00:30:20.410
which is repetitive or
describable.

483
00:30:21.190 --> 00:30:24.610
<v 3>We're working on a system which employees are rule based to assist in the</v>

484
00:30:24.611 --> 00:30:29.611
process of graphic design and texts layout to do this where using an expert

485
00:30:29.891 --> 00:30:34.220
system development tool called CASS and we've chosen the design,

486
00:30:34.240 --> 00:30:36.040
the business cards to serve as a case study.

487
00:30:37.240 --> 00:30:42.240
<v 4>The three of you worked professionally for national advertising or advertising,</v>

488
00:30:45.120 --> 00:30:47.890
the official
management.

489
00:30:48.400 --> 00:30:53.270
What is your company's financial scale medium with the type of image would you

490
00:30:53.280 --> 00:30:55.470
like to grow up gate progressive?

491
00:30:56.430 --> 00:30:58.460
Please wait while I like at creative.

492
00:30:58.930 --> 00:31:01.570
<v 3>Given the internal rules that we've put into the system,</v>

493
00:31:01.720 --> 00:31:05.800
it's decided that this particular layout is appropriate for me based on the

494
00:31:05.801 --> 00:31:06.700
answers I gave it.

495
00:31:09.210 --> 00:31:12.930
<v 0>Okay.
So it's funny,
yes.
But,
uh,
but even with some distance,</v>

496
00:31:12.931 --> 00:31:16.230
if you can erase the kind of a nostalgia and I mean,

497
00:31:16.231 --> 00:31:20.810
just plain humor and it's in it,
uh,
you can see,
um,

498
00:31:20.910 --> 00:31:23.790
an exploration of the desire of what we,

499
00:31:23.820 --> 00:31:26.760
what we want those interfaces to do and how we want them to behave and how we

500
00:31:26.761 --> 00:31:28.500
want them to relate to graphic design.

501
00:31:28.501 --> 00:31:32.640
Even if these are paths kind of not taken in.
A lot of this work existed,

502
00:31:32.670 --> 00:31:33.290
but it was,

503
00:31:33.290 --> 00:31:37.770
it existed in tentative in a media formats which would fall away quickly,

504
00:31:38.040 --> 00:31:42.630
which is a main motivation and kind of collecting this together both into a book

505
00:31:42.660 --> 00:31:47.660
and into the exhibition and documenting the work at the media lab.

506
00:31:48.060 --> 00:31:49.500
Goober did not write very often,

507
00:31:49.740 --> 00:31:54.060
but she did edit one issue of design quarterly out of the Walker art center.

508
00:31:54.210 --> 00:31:57.300
It was on computers and design and on the cover,
um,

509
00:31:57.480 --> 00:32:01.620
she used a software program to do nine different versions of the cover,

510
00:32:01.621 --> 00:32:05.630
which are reproduced on the cover.
They also were exploring what,
uh,

511
00:32:05.880 --> 00:32:09.040
they called it the ultimate designer workstation and,
uh,

512
00:32:09.090 --> 00:32:14.010
how we might use a screens and input devices,

513
00:32:14.030 --> 00:32:18.390
uh,
to do graphic design and in an iterative,

514
00:32:18.391 --> 00:32:21.840
responsive way.
Now this is an image that was,

515
00:32:21.841 --> 00:32:25.320
this is an image from the vow also about the same time.
It's a large format,

516
00:32:25.321 --> 00:32:29.550
Polaroid print,
kind of like that other one.
But this image started out in sis,

517
00:32:29.580 --> 00:32:34.500
started out digital and never,
uh,
and remained digital.
Uh,

518
00:32:34.800 --> 00:32:38.670
and I,
it was,
um,
what I liked so much about,

519
00:32:39.060 --> 00:32:41.000
there's a great insight that Muriel Cooper had.

520
00:32:41.360 --> 00:32:46.310
Do you think maybe one of her strongest,
which early on this is a late 1970,

521
00:32:46.311 --> 00:32:48.980
she said,
well,
in time,
uh,

522
00:32:49.120 --> 00:32:52.700
digital images are gonna stay on the screen and they're going to have a life of

523
00:32:52.701 --> 00:32:56.440
their own through networks.
I mean,
it sounds like,
uh,
I mean,

524
00:32:56.480 --> 00:32:59.600
of course we know that,
right?
But at the time we did not know that.

525
00:32:59.900 --> 00:33:04.340
And the way in which she pushed that through and made,
uh,
this image for example,

526
00:33:04.341 --> 00:33:09.230
to kind of stand as a pointer towards that idea.
I'm just nearly done.

527
00:33:09.260 --> 00:33:11.870
We're going to watch the last thing,
which is,
uh,

528
00:33:11.930 --> 00:33:16.490
Muriel Cooper introducing that Ted talk where we started.
And,
uh,

529
00:33:16.491 --> 00:33:20.430
we'll let the video that she showed,
let that play and we'll

530
00:33:20.550 --> 00:33:21.383
<v 1>move on</v>

531
00:33:24.520 --> 00:33:28.260
and design of the Haitian like B.

532
00:33:28.680 --> 00:33:33.680
And then for many years we've been building for the prototype and visualization.

533
00:33:34.440 --> 00:33:38.610
Ooh.
That would allow us to do something that seemed relatively

534
00:33:40.440 --> 00:33:45.330
intuitive and in order to say,

535
00:33:45.420 --> 00:33:49.020
what if we did this,
then what would happen?

536
00:33:49.021 --> 00:33:54.021
But to really visualize this stuff in as tight an iterative loop it and as the

537
00:33:54.301 --> 00:33:59.250
class that we could,
so we're looking for the design principle.
Um,

538
00:33:59.340 --> 00:34:01.260
we're not at all sure what they are.

539
00:34:01.820 --> 00:34:04.340
<v 0>Then she proceeded to show this,
uh,
this work,</v>

540
00:34:04.341 --> 00:34:07.010
which is called the information landscapes.

541
00:34:07.190 --> 00:34:12.190
And it was a proposal for an immersive typographic and environment.

542
00:34:12.560 --> 00:34:17.160
The user navigates their way through that uses,
uh,
relationships,

543
00:34:17.170 --> 00:34:21.530
three dimension over relationships in space to articulate,
uh,
relationships.

544
00:34:21.531 --> 00:34:26.531
That might be a communicated on a two dimensional surface by bold and Roman or

545
00:34:26.901 --> 00:34:31.460
type size or other kinds of typographic relationships.
And so this,
uh,

546
00:34:31.461 --> 00:34:35.300
this interface in a lot of ways collected her ideas about,
uh,

547
00:34:35.301 --> 00:34:38.990
the user and the reader having some degree of agency and the design and

548
00:34:38.991 --> 00:34:41.990
orientation,
the materials that they're using.
It,
uh,

549
00:34:42.050 --> 00:34:46.940
it leveraged off of a traditional graphic design knowledge but then rethought it

550
00:34:46.941 --> 00:34:50.860
in a completely new manner.
As I described this work,

551
00:34:50.890 --> 00:34:55.550
I had a large impact when it was shown and she traveled around showing it

552
00:34:55.940 --> 00:34:57.900
elsewhere.
Um,

553
00:34:58.160 --> 00:35:01.790
this was in 1994 and in February,
1994,

554
00:35:01.820 --> 00:35:06.740
she returned back to Cambridge after a trip to England and,
uh,

555
00:35:06.741 --> 00:35:11.260
died unexpectedly of a heart attack.
Um,
the,

556
00:35:11.290 --> 00:35:13.670
the work in the meantime,
um,

557
00:35:14.990 --> 00:35:19.990
I feel like hasn't been replicated or communicated or dealt with to the degree

558
00:35:22.161 --> 00:35:23.720
that I thought it would.
Um,

559
00:35:25.370 --> 00:35:29.570
and I think it's an open question as to why that's the case.
Certainly had the,

560
00:35:30.040 --> 00:35:33.470
uh,
when she died was,
um,
must be part of it,

561
00:35:33.590 --> 00:35:38.590
but it must be part of a larger story about how it's difficult to file the work

562
00:35:39.001 --> 00:35:42.570
under existing categories.
That's one thing,
uh,

563
00:35:42.571 --> 00:35:44.940
what a design practice might look like.
That's,
um,

564
00:35:45.390 --> 00:35:50.390
that's made with other people and that it doesn't sit in neatly defined

565
00:35:51.601 --> 00:35:52.680
disciplinary boundaries.

566
00:35:53.750 --> 00:35:58.750
<v 5>[inaudible]</v>

567
00:36:00.460 --> 00:36:05.170
<v 6>thanks David.
That was great.
I want to just start this off.</v>

568
00:36:05.200 --> 00:36:10.200
I'm looking at this image because this was my way into Muriel Cooper.

569
00:36:10.960 --> 00:36:15.960
I saw the photo before I knew of her or had seen her work and was immediately

570
00:36:17.231 --> 00:36:22.231
drawn to it for all of the reasons that you had previously said.

571
00:36:22.451 --> 00:36:24.130
She is barefoot.

572
00:36:24.520 --> 00:36:28.840
She's surrounded by unidentified men as you put it.
Um,

573
00:36:28.841 --> 00:36:33.160
so I wanted to ask you how you came to Mariel's work.
Um,

574
00:36:33.161 --> 00:36:34.180
what was your way in

575
00:36:36.380 --> 00:36:39.570
<v 0>my way into her work was twofold.</v>

576
00:36:39.990 --> 00:36:44.120
I originally,
I was,
when I first start working in graphic design,

577
00:36:44.300 --> 00:36:49.040
I was working at Ideo in San Francisco from 1995,
1997.

578
00:36:49.340 --> 00:36:53.090
I was working for a media lab student named Geeta Solomon,

579
00:36:53.091 --> 00:36:54.590
who was head of interaction design there.

580
00:36:54.890 --> 00:36:58.910
And I was hired as an interaction designer and I didn't even even quite know

581
00:36:58.911 --> 00:37:02.870
what that meant.
I was barely a graphic designer at that point.
Um,

582
00:37:03.320 --> 00:37:04.370
and uh,

583
00:37:04.910 --> 00:37:09.910
however at ideo there was a hotbed of activity around that emerging field and a

584
00:37:12.561 --> 00:37:15.170
lot of it's centered around Muriel Cooper's work,

585
00:37:15.200 --> 00:37:18.530
either people who had gone to the media lab or people who knew it,
et cetera.

586
00:37:18.860 --> 00:37:21.740
So that,
that's,
um,
that's when I was originally introduced to it.

587
00:37:21.741 --> 00:37:26.600
And then I came back to it when in 2006,
I think 2005,

588
00:37:26.601 --> 00:37:28.340
2006,
uh,

589
00:37:28.341 --> 00:37:32.270
when I was working doing graphic design for the Mit Center for advanced visual

590
00:37:32.271 --> 00:37:34.760
studies.
And that was,
uh,

591
00:37:34.790 --> 00:37:38.940
I went up there and found a closet full of posters that had a inventory.
Oh,

592
00:37:39.030 --> 00:37:43.280
kind of listing of what all the things they had done at the place over the
years.

593
00:37:43.281 --> 00:37:45.620
And they were exceptional posters.
And I thought,
oh,

594
00:37:45.621 --> 00:37:48.890
these must have been designed by Muriel Cooper because I knew she was around and

595
00:37:48.970 --> 00:37:52.850
etc. And so that piqued my interest and I started to look into it.

596
00:37:52.851 --> 00:37:55.160
It turns out none of them were designed by Muriel Cooper,

597
00:37:55.670 --> 00:37:59.670
but she'd printed most of them.
So again,
it's kind of like the sideways,
um,

598
00:37:59.990 --> 00:38:02.060
and anybody that that drew me into the work.

599
00:38:02.090 --> 00:38:06.410
And that became a fellowship with MIT and then,
uh,
led to a small,

600
00:38:06.800 --> 00:38:11.330
uh,
original text.
And then to then with Robert Reason Burger,

601
00:38:11.560 --> 00:38:14.510
it turned into an exhibition.
And then with rob as well,

602
00:38:14.540 --> 00:38:17.260
the book long version.

603
00:38:19.750 --> 00:38:22.690
<v 6>I also wanted to ask you about the books epigraph,</v>

604
00:38:22.691 --> 00:38:26.260
which is a quote from Muriel Cooper a that says,

605
00:38:26.261 --> 00:38:29.290
I guess I'm never sure that print is truly linear.

606
00:38:29.890 --> 00:38:34.540
And that's a quote that she gave Jen,
Janet Abrams in that ID story.

607
00:38:35.150 --> 00:38:39.060
Um,
what's the significance of this quote for you and Robert?
Um,

608
00:38:39.280 --> 00:38:41.650
why did you choose to start the book that way?

609
00:38:42.730 --> 00:38:43.001
<v 0>Uh,</v>

610
00:38:43.001 --> 00:38:45.970
I'm pretty sure it was rob who thought of it as the epigraph in the book and I,

611
00:38:46.040 --> 00:38:48.520
I said,
that's fantastic.
But why,

612
00:38:48.760 --> 00:38:53.020
why it was appealing was it has the circular quality of the way that she speaks

613
00:38:53.050 --> 00:38:57.070
and thinks.
And so it's like she says,
uh,

614
00:38:57.580 --> 00:39:00.910
she admits to doubt in the statement,
you know,
it's not like she says,

615
00:39:01.150 --> 00:39:04.540
books are not truly linear.
Print is not truly linear.
She says,
I'm not,

616
00:39:04.790 --> 00:39:07.320
I'm not convinced.
Right.
And so,
uh,

617
00:39:07.570 --> 00:39:11.530
it's that kind of productive doubt that runs through our work and it sounds like

618
00:39:11.710 --> 00:39:15.790
typical of how she would speak and seems like a great way to,
uh,

619
00:39:16.480 --> 00:39:21.480
slight a lightly perverse way to start a giant Hardebeck monograph.

620
00:39:22.530 --> 00:39:23.090
Hmm.

621
00:39:23.090 --> 00:39:27.380
<v 6>I like that.
I think that right before that quote in that interview too,
she,</v>

622
00:39:27.740 --> 00:39:30.800
she had,
she was reversing something that she said,
right.

623
00:39:30.801 --> 00:39:35.190
She said it was linear and then she goes back and says,
um,

624
00:39:35.360 --> 00:39:39.080
I'm never quite sure.
So I see that.
Go ahead.
Circle of doubt.

625
00:39:40.090 --> 00:39:40.923
Um,

626
00:39:41.420 --> 00:39:45.740
so you frame your essay in the book around seven artifacts,
um,

627
00:39:46.670 --> 00:39:51.560
and you zero in on those pieces to tell a particular story about Mario's work as

628
00:39:51.561 --> 00:39:55.760
a whole.
Um,
I'm wondering if,
um,

629
00:39:55.850 --> 00:39:58.550
outside of those seven pieces that you feature in the book,

630
00:39:58.910 --> 00:40:00.860
are there any that just didn't make the cut?

631
00:40:01.070 --> 00:40:03.910
Any edge cases that we should know about?

632
00:40:05.600 --> 00:40:08.090
<v 0>There are so many,
there are,
there are so many.</v>

633
00:40:08.470 --> 00:40:11.060
<v 3>MMM.
MMM.</v>

634
00:40:12.040 --> 00:40:16.640
<v 0>There are so many that just didn't fit because of space and that's it.
Um,</v>

635
00:40:16.670 --> 00:40:21.320
the work that's in the archive probably as of quite uneven quality and so

636
00:40:21.321 --> 00:40:25.340
sometimes they were picked for the subject matter as much as for the kind of

637
00:40:25.341 --> 00:40:28.580
graphic design or whatever interest in them.
Um,

638
00:40:28.790 --> 00:40:31.990
I'd say we scratched the surface.
Uh,

639
00:40:32.030 --> 00:40:36.530
her work was exceedingly well documented in terms of collected.
Um,

640
00:40:36.830 --> 00:40:38.480
it wasn't organized at the time,

641
00:40:38.481 --> 00:40:41.660
although Massachusetts College of art where the Muriel Cooper archive is,

642
00:40:41.990 --> 00:40:46.340
has done incredible work to put it together and then they were very generous

643
00:40:46.341 --> 00:40:50.180
with us giving us access and pulling things and reproducing things.
And,

644
00:40:50.900 --> 00:40:51.733
<v 3>great.</v>

645
00:40:52.230 --> 00:40:52.480
<v 6>Um,</v>

646
00:40:52.480 --> 00:40:57.480
and then last question and then I'll open it up to you guys to ask some

647
00:40:57.591 --> 00:41:01.370
questions and the,
the mix over to the side.
Um,

648
00:41:01.760 --> 00:41:05.900
can you talk about the influence that Muriel Cooper's work has had on your own

649
00:41:05.901 --> 00:41:06.734
work?

650
00:41:07.330 --> 00:41:08.660
<v 3>Okay.
Um,</v>

651
00:41:11.440 --> 00:41:15.610
<v 0>I think as I was,
as I was describing in the talk,</v>

652
00:41:16.870 --> 00:41:20.680
she was always interested in,
uh,

653
00:41:21.310 --> 00:41:26.310
both doing the work and being aware of doing the work or kind of interrogating

654
00:41:26.771 --> 00:41:28.180
what it is to do the work.

655
00:41:28.540 --> 00:41:32.050
And I think that's something that I've borrowed quite a lot from,

656
00:41:32.380 --> 00:41:34.930
from her model and,
um,

657
00:41:35.150 --> 00:41:38.720
which is a degree of kind of reflexivity in the,

658
00:41:39.200 --> 00:41:43.130
in like doing design and how it gets done.
And,
uh,

659
00:41:43.131 --> 00:41:47.330
this is not for the sake of a introspection or anything like this,

660
00:41:47.480 --> 00:41:51.890
but rather it's to productively kind of question assumptions that exist.

661
00:41:52.430 --> 00:41:54.920
And so,
um,
uh,

662
00:41:54.950 --> 00:41:59.710
so that's certainly one way that she's influenced me.
And I think the second way,

663
00:41:59.990 --> 00:42:03.260
the second kind of direct influence,
uh,

664
00:42:03.320 --> 00:42:07.190
she had is,
um,
is just through,

665
00:42:07.200 --> 00:42:12.200
I'm imagining a interfaces that were completely real time and that,

666
00:42:14.660 --> 00:42:19.460
uh,
that kind of evolved with the,
with the point of view of the person using it.

667
00:42:19.880 --> 00:42:22.130
And that's something that we know well now,

668
00:42:22.200 --> 00:42:24.530
but didn't know well even when I started working.

669
00:42:25.660 --> 00:42:29.230
<v 3>Great.
All right.
Anybody else have questions for David?</v>

670
00:42:30.400 --> 00:42:32.710
I just wanted to,
after her death,

671
00:42:33.490 --> 00:42:37.940
what happened to the visible language,
the poetry,

672
00:42:37.970 --> 00:42:40.780
where there people,
you could actually continue her work.

673
00:42:40.781 --> 00:42:42.610
What did it really stop with her death?

674
00:42:43.580 --> 00:42:47.180
<v 0>There were people,
there were her students,
Ron Mcneil is still living.</v>

675
00:42:47.390 --> 00:42:50.510
That was her partner in the visible language workshop.
Um,

676
00:42:50.600 --> 00:42:55.600
there were all of her students continued and a left and kind of create this

677
00:42:56.030 --> 00:43:00.470
diaspora of Tlw work.
Um,

678
00:43:00.920 --> 00:43:03.970
for example,
Lisa Strauss valid was there at the time.

679
00:43:03.990 --> 00:43:08.480
She's gone on to do lots of things within graphic design proper.
Um,

680
00:43:09.020 --> 00:43:11.270
uh,
the,

681
00:43:11.330 --> 00:43:16.330
there are students who didn't directly study under her but studied after her in

682
00:43:17.241 --> 00:43:20.300
what became the physical language workshop under John Mayeda.

683
00:43:20.510 --> 00:43:25.310
Like Ben Frye has gone on to do lots of work.
Um,
so it continued,

684
00:43:25.340 --> 00:43:29.270
but it continued,
uh,
a would they kind of sudden,
whoa.

685
00:43:30.380 --> 00:43:31.980
<v 3>So I think that a change things,</v>

686
00:43:32.820 --> 00:43:37.770
I was just looking at the work again in sort of realizing how radical it's still

687
00:43:37.771 --> 00:43:42.720
looks to today.
How unexpected.
Um,
and I just wanted to know,

688
00:43:42.721 --> 00:43:44.520
I mean,
often when the future gets here,

689
00:43:44.790 --> 00:43:47.790
it arrives in kind of a normal way or an expected way.
And I just,

690
00:43:47.940 --> 00:43:49.770
what do you think about radical interfaces now?

691
00:43:52.400 --> 00:43:54.680
<v 0>Um,
I wonder if it's a,</v>

692
00:43:54.740 --> 00:43:59.210
I wonder if it's partly a factor of her working in an academic context.

693
00:44:00.290 --> 00:44:02.330
You know,
I think,
I think yes to work does look radical.

694
00:44:02.360 --> 00:44:06.890
It didn't look like anything else that existed when it and when it emerged.

695
00:44:07.250 --> 00:44:10.040
Um,
and I think,
uh,

696
00:44:10.820 --> 00:44:15.820
I think that is partly to do with her kind of finding a unique line through

697
00:44:16.790 --> 00:44:20.060
graphic design and interface design that other people weren't following.
I mean,

698
00:44:20.061 --> 00:44:25.061
I understand that she would always watch cartoons on Saturday mornings because

699
00:44:25.161 --> 00:44:28.320
that kind of animation was interesting to her for her work.
I didn't know what,

700
00:44:28.340 --> 00:44:31.100
not that it looked like that,
but the,
all the techniques,

701
00:44:31.800 --> 00:44:35.640
how you abstract out and use graphics to filter information and,
you know,

702
00:44:35.670 --> 00:44:38.790
play things out dynamically every time.
So it's like,
you know,

703
00:44:38.791 --> 00:44:41.730
she might've said that was a radical interface.
Um,

704
00:44:42.510 --> 00:44:47.400
I have no idea about radic radical interfaces now other than,
um,

705
00:44:48.990 --> 00:44:53.920
of course in a commercial situation,
it's,
it's a more challenging to,
um,

706
00:44:54.840 --> 00:44:58.620
to introduce something that doesn't have a precedent because it,
uh,

707
00:44:58.650 --> 00:45:01.560
it relies on all the conventions that they exist.

708
00:45:02.490 --> 00:45:06.470
So the radical things have to be radical in one way and not radical at all and

709
00:45:06.471 --> 00:45:07.304
in another way.
Right.

710
00:45:08.320 --> 00:45:09.670
<v 6>I'm just curious for your thoughts,</v>

711
00:45:09.940 --> 00:45:13.910
given that so many of the people who came after him,
Muriel Cooper,
uh,

712
00:45:13.920 --> 00:45:17.560
they are interaction designers,
they sometimes self identify as artists.

713
00:45:17.561 --> 00:45:21.130
What do you think is her ultimate legacy?

714
00:45:21.131 --> 00:45:26.131
Is there a way to tidally tie that up given that we're in a room full of Ux

715
00:45:26.951 --> 00:45:27.850
designers today?

716
00:45:28.680 --> 00:45:29.513
<v 0>Yeah,</v>

717
00:45:30.720 --> 00:45:35.160
I think our presence is most felt within graphic design is it kind of transfers

718
00:45:35.161 --> 00:45:39.450
over to interaction design.
Um,
so,

719
00:45:41.040 --> 00:45:43.170
um,
so I suppose,

720
00:45:43.200 --> 00:45:47.460
and so I don't think her legacy is a visible at all.
And Art,
let's say,

721
00:45:47.700 --> 00:45:50.820
even if some of the people who she influenced kind of win on in that are

722
00:45:50.821 --> 00:45:52.920
identified in that direction.
Um,

723
00:45:53.010 --> 00:45:55.260
I think her background and training was graphic design.

724
00:45:55.261 --> 00:45:57.810
So that's where the or the work is kind of legible.

725
00:45:58.020 --> 00:46:03.020
So I think probably her legacy exists in a lots of graphic designers today.

726
00:46:03.681 --> 00:46:07.860
I'll make you know,
most graphic designers today who are working uh,

727
00:46:07.920 --> 00:46:12.720
on screen as the,
as the destination.
So it's a disburse legacy.

728
00:46:12.750 --> 00:46:13.800
I don't know,
it's not a,

729
00:46:15.240 --> 00:46:19.650
it's certainly not easy to identify it concretely,

730
00:46:20.820 --> 00:46:24.030
but they're,
they're concrete parts to it.
Like,
um,
for example,

731
00:46:24.090 --> 00:46:27.660
the architecture machine group at the beginning of the 1970s,

732
00:46:27.661 --> 00:46:31.020
they were developing anti les type is every time we see type on the screen

733
00:46:31.021 --> 00:46:32.670
that's blurred in order to make it sharper.

734
00:46:32.760 --> 00:46:37.760
That came from there or interfaces that use kind of immediate feedback to

735
00:46:39.360 --> 00:46:43.860
acknowledge a kind of user input and that that gap between when the action

736
00:46:43.861 --> 00:46:46.410
happens and its corresponding effect on screen was a reduced,

737
00:46:46.411 --> 00:46:48.420
reduced is directly comes from our work.
So

738
00:46:49.990 --> 00:46:52.960
I'm actually curious to know,
maybe these are two questions,

739
00:46:52.961 --> 00:46:54.190
but they're actually one,

740
00:46:54.191 --> 00:46:58.990
I'm curious to know what the graphic design community thought of Miro Cooper.
Um,

741
00:46:59.500 --> 00:47:03.670
I mean graphic design until very recently seems to be still a little bit fearful

742
00:47:03.671 --> 00:47:08.050
of computers.
I mean,
coding isn't even taught in most graphic design programs.

743
00:47:08.440 --> 00:47:12.010
Um,
I recall reading a little bit of Paul ran and him being sort of very,

744
00:47:12.670 --> 00:47:15.790
very skeptical of what computers could do in the early design process.

745
00:47:15.791 --> 00:47:20.791
And I wonder how mural communicated the value of computers or new interfaces in

746
00:47:21.370 --> 00:47:23.980
the more pure graphic design world.
I mean,

747
00:47:23.981 --> 00:47:28.510
I'm sure she felt right in at MIT media lab,
but how about outside of that?

748
00:47:29.020 --> 00:47:29.853
Yeah.

749
00:47:30.490 --> 00:47:34.720
<v 5>You know,
I think,
um,
well she never learned how to program.</v>

750
00:47:35.170 --> 00:47:37.690
She tried a bunch of times and kind of,
it never,

751
00:47:38.020 --> 00:47:40.300
it was not something that she was a,

752
00:47:40.540 --> 00:47:43.480
wanted to spend enough time to engage with even though,

753
00:47:44.110 --> 00:47:46.900
and she was consistently frustrated apparently by how slow computers,

754
00:47:46.901 --> 00:47:50.050
where no matter what,
no matter what newest computer is always like,
you know,

755
00:47:50.051 --> 00:47:53.830
she was cursing up a storm saying,
uh,
saying this is too slow.

756
00:47:54.430 --> 00:47:59.430
So I also understand that she would like insist on breaking out conversations of

757
00:48:00.491 --> 00:48:05.050
design from technology,
which sounds funny in retrograde,
but,
uh,

758
00:48:05.051 --> 00:48:07.750
at least at Strauss failed has mentioned that that was,

759
00:48:09.070 --> 00:48:13.810
that was an eyeopening distinction for her because you could talk about the way

760
00:48:13.811 --> 00:48:18.670
something worked and felt and what it should do in absence of what it can do or

761
00:48:19.780 --> 00:48:23.440
cannot do.
So,
uh,
I think by making,

762
00:48:23.441 --> 00:48:28.150
probably by making that distinction that helped her have a clearer foothold in

763
00:48:28.151 --> 00:48:31.690
the graphic design community.
But I also think her work is necessarily messy.

764
00:48:31.691 --> 00:48:36.400
It's not like tidy graphic design.
And so she was embraced.
But,

765
00:48:36.850 --> 00:48:39.570
um,
but I,

766
00:48:39.571 --> 00:48:43.330
I expect there's good bit of skepticism as well within that community also.

767
00:48:46.400 --> 00:48:50.480
<v 0>Okay.
It looks like we're at a time.
I think so.
Thanks,
David.
Thank you.</v>

768
00:48:50.870 --> 00:48:55.870
<v 5>[inaudible].</v>
