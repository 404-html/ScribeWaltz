1
00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:09.120
So how do you folks,
thank you guys for coming.
Uh,
my name is Scott Maxwell.

2
00:00:09.121 --> 00:00:13.450
I'm a Googler.
Um,
and our guest speaker today is Digo Porque Harris.

3
00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:18.990
He is the president and Cto of a company named ds maker.
Um,
in 2012,

4
00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:23.190
uh,
he,
uh,
hosted a Kickstarter for,
uh,
building a three d printer.

5
00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:26.610
The buco bought named cleverly after his dog,
um,

6
00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:30.750
and it was so successful at raised almost four times the expected funds and that

7
00:00:30.751 --> 00:00:34.770
helped Diego to go on and,
uh,
uh,
fund,
uh,
other three d printers,

8
00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:39.840
including this one right here.
This is my personal printer,
uh,
the Bukito printer.

9
00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:44.160
And over the course of Diego's talk,
you're going to see it make one of these.
Um,

10
00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:48.080
uh,
so Diego is here to talk to us today about the,
uh,
uh,

11
00:00:48.130 --> 00:00:49.640
make a revolution and,
uh,

12
00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:52.470
designing and building a three d printer and where they make a revolution coast

13
00:00:52.471 --> 00:00:55.470
from here.
Would you join me please?
And welcoming Diego.
Precarious.

14
00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:00.133
<v 1>Okay,</v>

15
00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:04.930
<v 2>cool.
Hi Guys.
How are you guys doing?
Um,
like I said,
I'm Diego.
Um,</v>

16
00:01:04.940 --> 00:01:06.530
I started these maker.
Uh,

17
00:01:06.531 --> 00:01:10.940
we kinda have the first a three d printer store in the country that we opened in

18
00:01:10.941 --> 00:01:15.330
Pasadena in 2012.
And uh,
yeah,
once we did the,

19
00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:16.340
I did the Kickstarter,

20
00:01:16.341 --> 00:01:20.030
that's when I opened the store and the ball started rolling from there.
Um,

21
00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:23.580
and uh,
he invited me.
Thank you Scott for inviting me.
Um,

22
00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:27.850
he invited me to show you guys a little the process and what the three d printer

23
00:01:27.851 --> 00:01:31.460
is made out of kind of the components and um,

24
00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:35.420
how I kinda got to design a three d printer I guess.
And um,

25
00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:38.930
and you know the details from there.
So,
um,

26
00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:41.840
well I was going to do today is kind of just go over the components of the three

27
00:01:41.841 --> 00:01:43.460
d printer,
kind of what they do,

28
00:01:43.461 --> 00:01:46.670
what's kind of important about him and how they function.
Um,

29
00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:50.750
and then go into a little bit of the software stuff.
Any software people here.

30
00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:53.090
I figured.

31
00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:56.810
So we'll try to jump into the software a little bit and then we could open it up

32
00:01:56.811 --> 00:02:01.110
for like Qa cause um,
um,
I'll give you a kind of a crash course of,
you know,

33
00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:02.210
how three d printer works.

34
00:02:02.211 --> 00:02:05.210
But then I'd like to know what you guys want to know that I can answer more

35
00:02:05.211 --> 00:02:08.960
specific thing.
Sounds good.
Great.
Um,
all right.

36
00:02:08.961 --> 00:02:12.380
So let's just jump right in there.
Um,

37
00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:16.070
how to build an FDM printer.
Um,
first of all,

38
00:02:16.071 --> 00:02:20.870
there's many technologies,
um,
in three d printing.
It's not just this type.

39
00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:25.610
There's powder systems,
there's liquid resin systems,
there's a paper one,

40
00:02:25.611 --> 00:02:28.700
the one that uses paper,
there's a bunch of technologies.
Um,

41
00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:32.750
I focused on this one because it was a very accessible type of three d printing.

42
00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:37.490
Um,
it's very affordable.
It's easy to get parts.
It's not messy.

43
00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:41.630
There's no powder liquids or anything crazy to deal with.
So it's really easy.

44
00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:45.830
It's very good home based type of machine or even an office,
um,
as it,

45
00:02:45.831 --> 00:02:47.870
cause he's Scott just like carries it everywhere with him.

46
00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:52.250
So very practical machine.
So that's why I really liked it.

47
00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:56.560
And it became my ultimate tool to just create stuff.
Um,

48
00:02:56.660 --> 00:02:58.910
how many of you guys,
uh,
uh,

49
00:02:58.960 --> 00:03:03.280
made a three d prints or worked with three d printers so far?
Yeah.
Okay,
cool.

50
00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:08.500
Um,
yeah,
so when I started in 2012,
I'd asked that question and people were like,

51
00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:11.660
what is three d printing?
What are you talking about?
Uh,

52
00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:16.090
finally it's great that technology of ketchup and it's very a very out there,

53
00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:20.470
a lot of competition too.
So just start off,

54
00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:24.980
there's basically five components to a three d printer.
Um,

55
00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:29.510
you got the Gantry and the frame.
Sometimes they're there together.
Uh,

56
00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:33.750
but the country gantry is what makes everything move in three d space.
Um,

57
00:03:33.790 --> 00:03:37.220
the extruder is what kind of spits out the material basically.
Um,

58
00:03:37.450 --> 00:03:41.250
this type of three d printer is,
uh,
if you simplify,

59
00:03:41.270 --> 00:03:43.960
it's basically a hot glue gun,
a very fancy hog Logan.

60
00:03:44.230 --> 00:03:47.050
It just melts material and pours it into layer by layer.

61
00:03:47.470 --> 00:03:49.930
And when we get to the software part of things,

62
00:03:49.931 --> 00:03:52.930
you'll see how that happens a little more detail.
Um,

63
00:03:52.960 --> 00:03:56.050
and then you have the platform,
uh,
which is,
uh,

64
00:03:56.080 --> 00:04:00.010
where your object starts from.
Um,
it can kind of start in outer space,

65
00:04:00.011 --> 00:04:02.020
so it has to start somewhere.
So in this case,

66
00:04:02.021 --> 00:04:04.980
the platform is where everything grows from.
Um,

67
00:04:05.420 --> 00:04:09.880
and to make all that happen,
you have all the electronics that holds it together.

68
00:04:10.390 --> 00:04:14.890
Um,
it makes the motor's move,
that temperatures remained steady,

69
00:04:15.070 --> 00:04:17.860
it reads in the data,
all that stuff.
That's the electronics part.

70
00:04:17.920 --> 00:04:19.930
And then the filament.
Uh,

71
00:04:19.990 --> 00:04:23.860
finally the film is what creates your object and what you know eventually

72
00:04:23.861 --> 00:04:27.430
becomes the object that you,
that the machine outfits,
right.

73
00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:28.750
So let's jump in there.

74
00:04:29.140 --> 00:04:34.140
So first you have the gantry and something about what's cool about three d space

75
00:04:34.481 --> 00:04:39.340
is there's many ways to deal with three d space in a mechanical way.
Um,

76
00:04:39.341 --> 00:04:42.010
so if you're trying to make a three d printer,
you kind of have to decide,

77
00:04:42.120 --> 00:04:46.720
decide the pros and cons of what kind of gantry system you want for what kind of

78
00:04:46.721 --> 00:04:48.110
advantages,
uh,

79
00:04:48.370 --> 00:04:51.370
that you want to create for the machine that you want to create a cause.

80
00:04:51.371 --> 00:04:56.371
They all have their little pros and cons and there's a few more details about

81
00:04:56.501 --> 00:05:00.220
all these.
Uh,
I'm going to talk over,
uh,
talk about,
um,

82
00:05:00.610 --> 00:05:04.180
but I'm going to give you kind of the basics of what each gantry system,

83
00:05:04.300 --> 00:05:08.890
how it helps or maybe it's not so good and vice versa.
So,

84
00:05:10.030 --> 00:05:10.930
um,
first of all,

85
00:05:10.931 --> 00:05:15.190
there's a pretty much three basic sets of how to move in three d space.

86
00:05:15.790 --> 00:05:19.480
You have,
you have three spaces,
x,
Y,
and Z,
right?

87
00:05:19.780 --> 00:05:20.870
So you need a,

88
00:05:20.950 --> 00:05:25.630
usually you move and two of those dimensions and then the,
uh,

89
00:05:25.660 --> 00:05:29.080
constantly basically as,
as a full layer,
a two dimensional layer.

90
00:05:29.470 --> 00:05:32.980
And then the Z is usually the one that makes it into the three d part.

91
00:05:33.430 --> 00:05:38.350
So your regular paper printer is a tutee machine,
right?
So it's x and y machine,

92
00:05:38.680 --> 00:05:43.060
but what makes a three d printer three d printer is that it moves up into the z

93
00:05:43.061 --> 00:05:46.100
axis and creates another layer on top of that one.
Um,

94
00:05:46.180 --> 00:05:50.860
so there's three different ways to kind of do that.
Um,
and a three d printer.

95
00:05:50.920 --> 00:05:55.870
Basically you can move the x and y move them in your x and y direction and then

96
00:05:55.871 --> 00:06:00.140
the z moves in a certain way or you could move,
uh,

97
00:06:00.350 --> 00:06:02.420
or you can move the,
the extruder,

98
00:06:02.421 --> 00:06:06.770
which is dispensing the material that could just stay steady and you can move

99
00:06:06.771 --> 00:06:08.180
the platform in x and y.

100
00:06:08.720 --> 00:06:12.980
Or you could do a combination of those were the extruder just moves into x and

101
00:06:12.981 --> 00:06:16.640
then moves up also.
But the platform is a why like this one.

102
00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:20.390
And we'll go over those quick examples.
So for instance,
um,

103
00:06:20.420 --> 00:06:24.620
if you've ever seen the machines like this,
they're kind of more boxy and stuff.

104
00:06:24.621 --> 00:06:29.540
They usually work in the x and y as the extruder and then the z and the
platform.

105
00:06:30.020 --> 00:06:34.580
So the,
the head basically moves like a,

106
00:06:34.610 --> 00:06:35.301
like a plotter.

107
00:06:35.301 --> 00:06:39.530
If you guys ever done a like drafting with blueprints and stuff that,

108
00:06:39.590 --> 00:06:44.070
or you're like [inaudible],
uh,
that's the way of doing it.
Um,

109
00:06:44.210 --> 00:06:46.940
you move in two directions,
uh,
uh,

110
00:06:46.970 --> 00:06:51.970
for the extruder and then the z platform would move down or are,

111
00:06:52.550 --> 00:06:56.390
or you can move everything up.
That whole gantry up.
Um,

112
00:06:56.990 --> 00:07:01.610
so the,
the,
this is one of the probably the best ways to make a three d printer.

113
00:07:01.970 --> 00:07:06.350
It has the most advantages I think,
um,
as far as,
uh,

114
00:07:06.860 --> 00:07:11.390
you know,
getting a really good output of your prints,
uh,
with a lot less,
uh,

115
00:07:11.780 --> 00:07:15.100
effort.
Um,
so basically,
uh,

116
00:07:15.410 --> 00:07:18.860
just moving the head means that you have,
you know,

117
00:07:18.861 --> 00:07:22.730
how heavy that head is all the time and it never changes the weight.

118
00:07:23.060 --> 00:07:25.070
So if you'd find tune your printer,

119
00:07:25.071 --> 00:07:28.910
you could figure out the accelerations and the jerkiness that it could take and

120
00:07:28.911 --> 00:07:32.810
all that.
And it's kind of static.
It doesn't change over time.
Um,

121
00:07:32.811 --> 00:07:36.080
so that way it will be very consistent prints and you could build as big as you

122
00:07:36.081 --> 00:07:38.870
want and you'll stay very consistent.
Um,

123
00:07:39.020 --> 00:07:42.050
the cons about this is that,
uh,

124
00:07:42.590 --> 00:07:47.270
when a major cons is that it does make the system a little complex.
Um,
there's,

125
00:07:47.590 --> 00:07:51.740
you have two axes running in like in parallel and motors are going to be in the

126
00:07:51.741 --> 00:07:54.380
same area and things like that.
Um,

127
00:07:54.650 --> 00:07:58.270
so that's one thing and sometimes people,
uh,

128
00:07:58.310 --> 00:08:01.760
the way it's designed is since the,
if the head is very heavy,

129
00:08:02.060 --> 00:08:06.470
it gets even more complicated to make all the belts really tight and the motor

130
00:08:06.471 --> 00:08:07.251
stronger and all that.

131
00:08:07.251 --> 00:08:10.640
So instead what they do is they put the extruder or somewhere else and they feed

132
00:08:10.641 --> 00:08:11.091
into it.

133
00:08:11.091 --> 00:08:15.200
And I'm going to explain about that in a little bit and that kind of compromises

134
00:08:15.440 --> 00:08:19.880
a little bit of the extrusion feature or details,
but,
um,

135
00:08:20.870 --> 00:08:23.960
um,
it just makes things a little more complicated.
So

136
00:08:25.790 --> 00:08:29.720
you'll see it gets things a worked up in a little different way.
Um,

137
00:08:29.870 --> 00:08:34.870
the next way to do it is moving your platform x and y and then just lifting the

138
00:08:36.021 --> 00:08:37.990
head up.
Like in this case where the,

139
00:08:37.991 --> 00:08:42.020
the head just stays in one spot as the layer prints and then the head just moves

140
00:08:42.021 --> 00:08:46.850
a little bit.
But the platform keeps going.
Um,
this does make the,

141
00:08:47.060 --> 00:08:50.180
in in this format,
it makes the three d printer a little bit,

142
00:08:50.690 --> 00:08:53.190
maybe cheaper and a little maybe easier.
Uh,

143
00:08:53.390 --> 00:08:58.230
but the drawbacks is that moving the three d printed object that's being
printed,

144
00:08:58.590 --> 00:09:00.690
so throughout your print,
the,

145
00:09:00.750 --> 00:09:04.230
the nurses and the weights start shifting or it starts getting heavier and

146
00:09:04.231 --> 00:09:07.830
heavier and you can't really compensate for that in a really good way.

147
00:09:07.831 --> 00:09:11.190
So you'd have to just make everything nice and solid to begin with,

148
00:09:11.191 --> 00:09:15.660
which means you have a little heavier motors are heavier stuff to deal with.
Um,

149
00:09:15.661 --> 00:09:20.661
and also it's probably the one of the least efficient use of space,

150
00:09:21.430 --> 00:09:22.790
um,
because the platform has,

151
00:09:22.890 --> 00:09:25.080
the whole platform has to move from one end to the other.

152
00:09:25.081 --> 00:09:29.310
So you need those margins,
uh,
to deal with that.
Right.
Um,

153
00:09:29.340 --> 00:09:31.410
and the other case,
like the other machine,

154
00:09:31.860 --> 00:09:34.320
the only margin you have to deal with is the head itself.

155
00:09:34.320 --> 00:09:35.610
And if the head's pretty small,

156
00:09:36.090 --> 00:09:39.180
then there's not a lot of extra footprints compared to how big your printer

157
00:09:39.181 --> 00:09:41.700
prints.
All right.

158
00:09:42.060 --> 00:09:46.740
And then the other form is like the ones I make.
Um,
like the Bukito.

159
00:09:47.100 --> 00:09:51.390
And the way,
the reason we made this one is that,
um,

160
00:09:51.480 --> 00:09:55.950
we decided that making the,
the axis very independent to each other,

161
00:09:56.130 --> 00:09:58.740
we'll make them very robust.
Um,

162
00:09:58.830 --> 00:10:01.230
but it does it so it keeps the machine very simple.

163
00:10:01.500 --> 00:10:05.820
So the y has its own rail and its own direction,
its own motor and that's it.

164
00:10:06.090 --> 00:10:07.020
With the platform,

165
00:10:07.170 --> 00:10:12.170
the x moves the head back and forth and then we created a system to move the x

166
00:10:13.650 --> 00:10:18.570
or yeah,
the extruder up.
Um,
and I decided to do this because it was a,

167
00:10:19.170 --> 00:10:23.520
um,
in this way I actually created the rails to be also the frame.

168
00:10:23.550 --> 00:10:28.170
So it became very,
very simplified machine.
Um,
and it's very,

169
00:10:28.171 --> 00:10:28.951
very robust.

170
00:10:28.951 --> 00:10:32.580
And one of the features that we like bragging about it on this machine is that

171
00:10:32.640 --> 00:10:35.720
it could print like in naming any direction,
um,

172
00:10:35.880 --> 00:10:40.370
cause everything's very stiff in light and uh,
uh,
you know,

173
00:10:40.380 --> 00:10:42.430
very sturdy type of machine.
Um,

174
00:10:42.480 --> 00:10:45.690
the disadvantage about this is that you're kind of moving the platform.

175
00:10:46.080 --> 00:10:49.890
The thing is we're not moving it in two dimensions.
We're only moving in one.

176
00:10:49.891 --> 00:10:52.800
So it's a little,
it's just a little easier to deal with.

177
00:10:52.830 --> 00:10:57.230
And there's a lot less issues compared to moving in the x and y direction,
right?

178
00:10:57.890 --> 00:11:02.520
No.
So,
oh yeah.
So this is a picture of my,
the Buco about,

179
00:11:02.650 --> 00:11:07.200
uh,
my,
the first Michigan,
the predecessor to this one.
And,
um,

180
00:11:08.080 --> 00:11:12.270
and I talk about a little funny thing that I discovered in designing this

181
00:11:12.271 --> 00:11:16.290
machine,
um,
and researching why other people did certain things.
Um,

182
00:11:16.291 --> 00:11:20.700
in this case we did the same system is this,
um,
but we had the,

183
00:11:21.060 --> 00:11:24.690
uh,
you could see the extruder in the middle and then the whole,

184
00:11:24.840 --> 00:11:29.700
the whole z movement and the z space moves up a parallel to each other.

185
00:11:29.701 --> 00:11:34.660
So we have two,
two motors and screws to lift all that up right to z.
Uh,

186
00:11:34.680 --> 00:11:39.300
that makes it a little more complex,
but,
um,
it does make it actually practical.

187
00:11:39.330 --> 00:11:43.140
And the first question is we've had,
when we would,
you know,

188
00:11:43.200 --> 00:11:47.880
show people the machine is,
they're like,
well,
why do you have two motors,
uh,

189
00:11:47.881 --> 00:11:49.090
with two screws on each side?

190
00:11:49.091 --> 00:11:52.920
I want you to just use one motor and time together with the bell and do it that,

191
00:11:53.170 --> 00:11:57.790
right?
So they're always in sync.
So,
um,
if one gets a little,
it won't,

192
00:11:57.880 --> 00:12:01.450
you know,
one won't go higher than the other by itself.
Um,

193
00:12:01.540 --> 00:12:06.540
the reason is we actually investigated it and we ended up finding out that I'm

194
00:12:07.570 --> 00:12:10.210
using two motors independently,

195
00:12:10.300 --> 00:12:15.300
but tied together like chronically was pretty much the same reliability as doing

196
00:12:15.641 --> 00:12:19.720
the belt system,
but it actually costs less to do it.
Um,

197
00:12:20.180 --> 00:12:21.190
and you actually get double,

198
00:12:21.191 --> 00:12:23.830
almost double the power because we have two motors lifting it up.

199
00:12:23.920 --> 00:12:27.950
So even if you have two small motors,
they're both doing half the weight.
Um,

200
00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:29.170
and doing the belt system,

201
00:12:29.260 --> 00:12:32.650
you have to have the perfect size belt because it has to be continuous belt.

202
00:12:33.010 --> 00:12:34.450
So the tightness has to be there,

203
00:12:34.451 --> 00:12:37.810
you have to make the bearings and the pulleys and all that and ended up actually

204
00:12:37.811 --> 00:12:41.530
costing more to do that and just putting two independent motors wired together.

205
00:12:42.100 --> 00:12:45.790
So that was like one of the cool like early discoveries and I'm like,
oh,

206
00:12:45.791 --> 00:12:50.110
that's why they do that.
So it was very interesting to find stuff like that out.

207
00:12:51.680 --> 00:12:56.590
Um,
all right.
Um,
so another gantry system that exists,
there's a few,

208
00:12:56.591 --> 00:12:59.830
a couple of other ones.
Um,
it's called a delta machine.

209
00:12:59.980 --> 00:13:02.630
I don't know if you guys seen these types of three d printers.
Um,

210
00:13:02.680 --> 00:13:07.270
basically they use three motors and three arms to do all x,
Y,

211
00:13:07.271 --> 00:13:09.420
and z axes.
Um,

212
00:13:09.490 --> 00:13:14.490
and the pros about this is that you have three exact arms and three exact motors

213
00:13:14.621 --> 00:13:18.940
through exact belts,
through exact everything to do all your,
uh,
x,

214
00:13:18.941 --> 00:13:20.890
Y and z movements.
Um,

215
00:13:21.340 --> 00:13:26.140
the cons is that you probably guys like that word Algorithms,
um,

216
00:13:26.560 --> 00:13:31.390
this type of machine compared to these,
these are very linear,
very,
very,

217
00:13:31.391 --> 00:13:35.410
uh,
static resolution.
So if it moves,
you know,

218
00:13:35.590 --> 00:13:38.380
one millimeter here,
it takes certain amount of steps.

219
00:13:38.381 --> 00:13:39.520
And if it moves it over here,

220
00:13:39.521 --> 00:13:42.190
it takes the exact same amount of steps to move that one millimeter no matter

221
00:13:42.191 --> 00:13:46.810
where it's at.
It's very consistent,
very,
you know,
one or it's like a ruler.

222
00:13:47.340 --> 00:13:52.150
Um,
these machines working arcs.
So every art changes,

223
00:13:52.151 --> 00:13:53.380
constant resolution.

224
00:13:53.381 --> 00:13:56.920
There's never a spot where the resolution is the same throughout the platform.

225
00:13:57.430 --> 00:13:59.260
And to make that happen,

226
00:13:59.290 --> 00:14:03.850
it takes some pretty serious algorithm in math and a lot of decimal points.

227
00:14:04.480 --> 00:14:05.260
Um,

228
00:14:05.260 --> 00:14:09.910
and some of these microcontrollers can't handle that many precision decimal

229
00:14:09.911 --> 00:14:14.060
points sometimes.
So if you get machines like this,
you probably want the best,
uh,

230
00:14:14.170 --> 00:14:17.150
chip possible to run it because you have a lot of resumes,

231
00:14:17.280 --> 00:14:20.980
a lot of resolution and math to deal with.
Um,

232
00:14:21.190 --> 00:14:22.600
and the other thing is if something,

233
00:14:22.601 --> 00:14:25.750
it's a little harder to get these really straight because if something's a

234
00:14:25.751 --> 00:14:28.690
little off,
um,
it might still work fine,

235
00:14:28.691 --> 00:14:32.380
but it's not going to be very accurate because one little thing somewhere is

236
00:14:32.381 --> 00:14:35.450
going to be really hard to catch or figure out where it's not straight.

237
00:14:37.600 --> 00:14:41.940
And,
uh,
and since you're kind of moving the extruder,
um,

238
00:14:41.950 --> 00:14:46.730
in every direction,
you kind of need the extruder to be pretty light.
Um,

239
00:14:46.810 --> 00:14:49.990
you can't put like a,
it's not,
you can't,
it's a,

240
00:14:50.530 --> 00:14:52.400
once you put a heavy motor on there,

241
00:14:52.520 --> 00:14:57.260
then you have a lot of inertia is going back and forth and uh,
that's just,

242
00:14:57.290 --> 00:15:00.740
that starts affecting your resolution,
your reliability.

243
00:15:00.770 --> 00:15:03.590
Like if it travels too far and it jerks too much,

244
00:15:03.890 --> 00:15:07.610
the steps a on a motor might change and then it's completely out of whack really

245
00:15:07.611 --> 00:15:12.500
fast.
So,
so it's very sensitive.
Yeah.
And your speed goes down.
Yeah.

246
00:15:12.501 --> 00:15:16.550
So as your weight goes up,
your speed starts going way down really fast.

247
00:15:17.300 --> 00:15:19.510
Cool.
And then the other one that's kind of out there that I saw,

248
00:15:19.511 --> 00:15:22.520
it's kind of weird.
It was also,
it's called a polar machine.

249
00:15:22.820 --> 00:15:27.820
There was only a few out there because it's not really an advantageous way of

250
00:15:28.791 --> 00:15:33.540
doing it,
but in this way,
the head kind of,
uh,
uh,

251
00:15:33.830 --> 00:15:38.120
actually moves in the x kind of direction and the z direction like ours,

252
00:15:38.121 --> 00:15:43.121
but the plate moves in a circle and that must be even more serious algorithms to

253
00:15:45.051 --> 00:15:49.640
figure that out.
Um,
and so I think it's like fun machine to watch,

254
00:15:49.641 --> 00:15:53.810
shall I brands.
But when you actually print stuff on it,
you'll see,

255
00:15:53.811 --> 00:15:54.840
I don't know if he could tell him this and,

256
00:15:54.850 --> 00:15:59.850
but it creates like really weird like patterns in your object just because it's

257
00:16:00.981 --> 00:16:01.250
probably,

258
00:16:01.250 --> 00:16:04.760
it's a lot of it to do with the rounding of decimal points and the algorithms

259
00:16:05.210 --> 00:16:06.830
like you,
you can't do,

260
00:16:07.770 --> 00:16:10.630
it's just really hard and these processors can't do that.

261
00:16:10.631 --> 00:16:14.610
Be Huge of a calculations for that.
So that's another way of,
uh,

262
00:16:15.410 --> 00:16:19.370
doing the x,
Y and z movement.
All right.
Um,
the other one,

263
00:16:19.400 --> 00:16:23.420
the other newer ones that I saw come up because of three d printing that are

264
00:16:23.570 --> 00:16:26.000
here is called core x,
y or h bots.

265
00:16:26.360 --> 00:16:30.770
And this one's getting very popular because it has a lot of good advantages.
Um,

266
00:16:30.771 --> 00:16:35.720
it's a little more complex to design.
You have to really do some good serious,
uh,

267
00:16:36.230 --> 00:16:39.740
precision where all the stuff goes.
But once you have it,
it's a very,

268
00:16:39.741 --> 00:16:41.390
very solid a type of working.

269
00:16:41.720 --> 00:16:45.990
And the way it works is you just have two motors in the back,
uh,
or in the front.

270
00:16:45.991 --> 00:16:49.430
It depends how you design it and it works.
Kind of like an etch a sketch.

271
00:16:49.431 --> 00:16:52.220
Have you got,
you guys do decks,
etch a sketch at some point,
right?

272
00:16:52.250 --> 00:16:56.180
So it's just kind of moving two knobs and depending on the sequence of how you

273
00:16:56.181 --> 00:16:59.120
move them together,
it goes in different directions.
Um,

274
00:16:59.121 --> 00:17:01.760
so if you move just 1:00 AM I go diagonal one way,

275
00:17:01.761 --> 00:17:03.830
if you move the other goes the other way and vice versa.

276
00:17:04.310 --> 00:17:08.600
And that's how they h the kind of h.
Dot.
Works.
Um,

277
00:17:08.900 --> 00:17:09.990
the good about this is it,

278
00:17:09.991 --> 00:17:14.030
it gets very efficient to make that compared to the other,

279
00:17:14.031 --> 00:17:18.060
just a normal x and y with a bunch of belts in rods.
Um,

280
00:17:18.080 --> 00:17:21.330
this one has a lot less component count to do it.
Um,

281
00:17:21.350 --> 00:17:24.260
but you need a few components that need to be very nice and solid,

282
00:17:24.261 --> 00:17:26.460
like the rails and things.
Um,

283
00:17:27.980 --> 00:17:32.420
this one's very good for mass production.
Yeah.
So this is an Hba and they'll,

284
00:17:32.510 --> 00:17:35.150
uh,
the way this works is a one,

285
00:17:35.660 --> 00:17:39.470
one is attached to one side and one's attached to the other side of the
carriage.

286
00:17:39.850 --> 00:17:42.200
Um,
and depends on the sequence,
how they move.

287
00:17:42.201 --> 00:17:46.700
It makes all your x and y movements.
Um,
on the core x,

288
00:17:46.701 --> 00:17:49.220
y this is the core x,
y system.

289
00:17:49.560 --> 00:17:54.560
And if you guys like math problems and equations or some down there,
uh,

290
00:17:54.570 --> 00:17:57.780
but it's actually very simple.
And,
uh,

291
00:17:57.840 --> 00:18:01.440
the way it works is when you spin one motor actually goes diagonal and when you

292
00:18:01.441 --> 00:18:04.980
spend the other one,
it goes the other direction.
So when they both been together,

293
00:18:04.981 --> 00:18:09.660
it goes in the x or the y direction.
Um,
it depends on which rotation they do.

294
00:18:10.140 --> 00:18:14.670
Um,
and I have a machine that we offer now that actually uses a system and it's

295
00:18:14.671 --> 00:18:19.290
really nice.
Um,
and it's very calm.
It's very compact.
The way they do it.

296
00:18:19.590 --> 00:18:24.000
And the advantage over core x,
y,
which is this one over this one,

297
00:18:24.450 --> 00:18:25.410
is that the core x,

298
00:18:25.411 --> 00:18:30.411
y um ha is naturally self aligning.

299
00:18:30.481 --> 00:18:31.080
It's,
Oh,

300
00:18:31.080 --> 00:18:35.160
it always wants to kind of keep itself parallel to each one because it has the

301
00:18:35.161 --> 00:18:39.450
exact same forces pulling on itself every time it moves the age.

302
00:18:39.451 --> 00:18:42.630
But um,
unfortunately when you have one,

303
00:18:42.660 --> 00:18:44.700
maybe one rail is dragging a little bit,

304
00:18:44.850 --> 00:18:48.480
it's going to want to bind and get crooked pretty easily.
So the,

305
00:18:49.020 --> 00:18:52.380
the adoption of the core x y is a lot better because it's kind of like a self

306
00:18:52.381 --> 00:18:55.110
aligning.
You don't have to go and double check that things are straight.
Again,

307
00:18:55.410 --> 00:18:58.260
if something gets out of whack,
it kind of self does it on its own.

308
00:18:59.820 --> 00:19:02.820
So that's something really cool about the core x y system,

309
00:19:06.120 --> 00:19:06.953
<v 3>Huh?</v>

310
00:19:08.610 --> 00:19:11.280
<v 2>No.
Um,
not that I know of,</v>

311
00:19:11.281 --> 00:19:15.750
especially cause a lot of manufacturers are using it is so,
uh,

312
00:19:15.840 --> 00:19:17.730
if there is,
nobody has called it out anywhere,

313
00:19:17.731 --> 00:19:22.230
but I think somebody posted this a long time ago.
Maybe Leonardo dementia,

314
00:19:22.250 --> 00:19:24.690
I don't know.
It could be way back then.
Uh,

315
00:19:25.020 --> 00:19:28.830
but it came out and it got published and they talked about it.

316
00:19:28.860 --> 00:19:33.510
It's probably some university or something.
Um,
yeah.
And,
and people adopted it.

317
00:19:33.570 --> 00:19:38.220
Um,
I kinda so I,
I believe it's open source.
You can totally do that.

318
00:19:38.221 --> 00:19:39.540
Exactly.
Um,

319
00:19:40.630 --> 00:19:41.463
<v 3>yeah.</v>

320
00:19:41.940 --> 00:19:43.830
<v 2>It's super possible that it could be.</v>

321
00:19:47.600 --> 00:19:48.433
<v 3>Yeah,</v>

322
00:19:48.580 --> 00:19:51.400
<v 2>yeah,
yeah.
Old,
uh,</v>

323
00:19:51.700 --> 00:19:54.520
old drafting boards that had the rulers that moved in parallel,

324
00:19:54.550 --> 00:19:58.470
they would use stuff like that,
uh,
that would help you move him,
you know,

325
00:19:58.750 --> 00:20:00.850
so that you don't have to just sit there and hold everything.

326
00:20:01.000 --> 00:20:02.260
It would just kind of keep itself straight.

327
00:20:02.261 --> 00:20:06.220
They had stuff like that going on with that.
Um,
and plotters,

328
00:20:06.221 --> 00:20:08.970
I think some plotters did things like that too.
Um,

329
00:20:09.100 --> 00:20:11.980
but this is a machine we offer.
Uh,
it's actually made in Germany.

330
00:20:12.130 --> 00:20:15.130
It's called the craft bop,
but this one uses the core x,
y.

331
00:20:15.550 --> 00:20:19.840
And it was a good chance for me to actually see somebody created.
And I've have,

332
00:20:20.590 --> 00:20:24.250
uh,
more than thousand hours on this machine and it works really nice.

333
00:20:24.280 --> 00:20:28.930
Super steady.
Never gets out of whack.
Very,
very well belt.
Cool.

334
00:20:29.390 --> 00:20:33.820
All right.
So now we get to the extruder.
Um,
so like I explained before,

335
00:20:33.821 --> 00:20:38.110
this is a kind of a very fancy hot glue gun and it's pretty simple.

336
00:20:38.110 --> 00:20:41.310
The way it works.
Um,
extraordinary basically consist,

337
00:20:41.570 --> 00:20:45.910
it starts off at the top where the material comes in and has usually we have a

338
00:20:45.911 --> 00:20:50.650
gear,
uh,
some kind of gear,
uh,
type of wheel with teeth on it.

339
00:20:50.950 --> 00:20:54.850
And that kind of forcefully just bites into the material and feeds it through.

340
00:20:55.120 --> 00:20:55.650
And you'll,

341
00:20:55.650 --> 00:20:59.530
you always have the wheel on the other side to just put the pressure on it.
Um,

342
00:20:59.560 --> 00:21:03.520
there's some extruders there.
There's like another 20 ways to make an extruder,

343
00:21:04.300 --> 00:21:06.210
but this is the most common,
uh,

344
00:21:06.760 --> 00:21:09.220
cause you could have teeth on both sides if you want and things like that,

345
00:21:09.640 --> 00:21:13.810
but it gets more complicated.
And then from there it goes down,
usually a barrel,

346
00:21:13.840 --> 00:21:14.950
which has to be cold.

347
00:21:15.280 --> 00:21:19.390
And then right at the tip is where your heater and a sensor is to heat up the

348
00:21:19.391 --> 00:21:23.110
material at the right temperature for what you're working with.
Um,

349
00:21:23.140 --> 00:21:25.330
and that comes out of the a lot smaller hole.

350
00:21:25.770 --> 00:21:26.603
<v 3>MMM.</v>

351
00:21:28.300 --> 00:21:31.960
<v 2>So that's basically how an extruder works.
Does that make sense?
Everybody?</v>

352
00:21:32.110 --> 00:21:34.730
<v 3>What's the
what?</v>

353
00:21:37.150 --> 00:21:41.880
<v 2>Oh,
well whoever illustrated this called it thin plastic.</v>

354
00:21:41.881 --> 00:21:46.630
But technically it might be because the motor,
the motor pulses very gently,

355
00:21:46.920 --> 00:21:49.900
uh,
but it's so small it doesn't come out.
It'd be,
it's comes out like a noodle.

356
00:21:50.790 --> 00:21:55.210
So it just comes out in one stream usually.
Um,
all right,

357
00:21:55.420 --> 00:21:58.930
so the main part of the extruder is kind of this one.
Um,

358
00:21:59.350 --> 00:22:02.350
it's not the most important because they all have to kind of work together.

359
00:22:02.620 --> 00:22:05.980
A Three d printer is one of those machines that if one part doesn't work right

360
00:22:05.981 --> 00:22:06.970
or not,

361
00:22:07.060 --> 00:22:11.800
nothing really good comes out of like everything has to work in unison and,

362
00:22:11.801 --> 00:22:15.940
uh,
an orchestration for it to work.
Right.
Um,
but this is kind of like a,

363
00:22:15.970 --> 00:22:20.200
what a hot end looks like.
And I think I brought one here somewhere.

364
00:22:22.300 --> 00:22:24.290
<v 3>Uh,
Jonathan.
Oh,</v>

365
00:22:25.510 --> 00:22:30.460
<v 2>do you have the box with the little extruder samples and stuff?
Yeah.</v>

366
00:22:30.461 --> 00:22:32.020
Could you go,
well,
we're bringing us home.
I'll,

367
00:22:32.110 --> 00:22:35.600
I'll bring some stuff to pass around so you guys can look at it up close.
Um,

368
00:22:35.770 --> 00:22:39.000
but the,
this is a typical design of an extruder,
which has a,

369
00:22:39.180 --> 00:22:42.970
a heater cartridge through the whole,
um,
and then the main barrel.

370
00:22:43.120 --> 00:22:46.750
And then the nozzle tip and the nozzle is what creates the resolution of your

371
00:22:46.751 --> 00:22:51.160
printer.
So if it's a 0.4 millimeter,
a nozzle,

372
00:22:51.250 --> 00:22:55.550
that means your,
your beads going to be at least 0.4 millimeters.
Um,

373
00:22:55.570 --> 00:22:59.180
it can't be skinnier,
so it has to at least come out and it's like,
uh,

374
00:22:59.260 --> 00:23:03.520
pushing to space,
uh,
toothpaste out of it.
Uh,
uh,
tube,

375
00:23:03.910 --> 00:23:07.300
it only comes out that thick.
It won't come out skinnier than that.
Um,

376
00:23:07.330 --> 00:23:09.850
so you can't get resolution sharper than that.
Um,

377
00:23:09.900 --> 00:23:11.730
so if you want a higher resolution,

378
00:23:11.731 --> 00:23:15.190
you've got to get a smaller hole for your nozzle.
Um,

379
00:23:15.220 --> 00:23:18.400
but the important part about this is that,
um,

380
00:23:19.570 --> 00:23:22.150
the smaller the hole and the bigger the filament,

381
00:23:22.151 --> 00:23:23.770
the more back pressure there is,

382
00:23:24.190 --> 00:23:28.180
which means a motor that's driving the filament down into it and needs to be a

383
00:23:28.181 --> 00:23:32.560
lot stronger,
uh,
when the ratio is really a big.

384
00:23:32.980 --> 00:23:34.810
Um,
so in this case,
uh,

385
00:23:35.260 --> 00:23:40.260
the one 75 millimeter thick filaments that you'll see mentioned later also,

386
00:23:41.020 --> 00:23:45.680
um,
is getting a lot more popular because your back pressure is so much less

387
00:23:45.681 --> 00:23:50.600
compared.
So if I have a,
uh,
a thicker filament that's like three millimeter,

388
00:23:50.601 --> 00:23:55.601
which is the other common size compared to a 0.5 millimeter nozzle and a one 75

389
00:23:56.061 --> 00:23:59.600
millimeter.
And also with a 0.5 millimeter nozzle with the same amount,

390
00:23:59.810 --> 00:24:04.220
the back pressures like six times different actually because it's a volume based

391
00:24:04.221 --> 00:24:06.800
type of calculation.
Um,

392
00:24:07.100 --> 00:24:09.350
so there's an advantage and disadvantage of the two,

393
00:24:09.351 --> 00:24:13.310
but the one 75 is getting more popular because it's an easier way to drive that

394
00:24:13.311 --> 00:24:14.950
filament through the nozzle.
Um,

395
00:24:14.951 --> 00:24:18.650
and so you need a lot less hardware and ends up being a little more reliable and

396
00:24:18.651 --> 00:24:22.220
things like that.
Um,
so yeah,

397
00:24:22.250 --> 00:24:25.340
so the heater block has a cartridge and then a sensor and right next to it to

398
00:24:25.341 --> 00:24:27.900
kind of,
so the process or could figure out what,
uh,

399
00:24:27.950 --> 00:24:31.430
what the temperature is going on with it.
Um,

400
00:24:32.090 --> 00:24:35.420
the other really important part about this is that since you have this really

401
00:24:35.421 --> 00:24:38.000
hot thing going on,
at the tip of that,

402
00:24:38.001 --> 00:24:41.750
heat's going to travel up throughout the extruder all the way up as things,

403
00:24:41.810 --> 00:24:46.520
as time goes by,
obviously.
Um,
so most of these extruders,
um,

404
00:24:46.550 --> 00:24:51.170
like this one has a fan in the front and that keeps that top part fighting the

405
00:24:51.171 --> 00:24:55.820
cold back down into that heating area.
Um,
and the reason is that,

406
00:24:55.850 --> 00:24:59.390
um,
that if the filament starts melting too early,

407
00:24:59.690 --> 00:25:02.960
it's going to create a lots of friction and trying to go down that tube and it,

408
00:25:03.080 --> 00:25:07.910
and plastic expands too.
So it's gonna like try to shove it's way down.
So,

409
00:25:08.210 --> 00:25:12.430
uh,
the basic rule about three d printing with this type is you want like the

410
00:25:12.500 --> 00:25:15.080
smallest transition between the cold and the hot.

411
00:25:15.410 --> 00:25:18.050
So that way as soon as it gets warm,
it just melts and it's,

412
00:25:18.080 --> 00:25:21.480
and it's there and you create the least amount of friction.
Um,

413
00:25:21.890 --> 00:25:25.640
I got pass a couple of these arena.
You guys want chicken mountain?
Um,

414
00:25:26.600 --> 00:25:30.980
sort of here.
This is a Bukito extruder.
Um,
I guess could look at,

415
00:25:31.830 --> 00:25:34.880
and you guys know you probably took it apart,
yours,
uh,

416
00:25:34.881 --> 00:25:36.680
and this is from another company also,

417
00:25:36.710 --> 00:25:41.710
you guys could train and this is a whole extruder mechanism so he could see that

418
00:25:43.540 --> 00:25:47.040
that heat sinks there.
Um,
everything.

419
00:25:47.270 --> 00:25:50.960
So it's important to kind of keep that top part,
uh,

420
00:25:50.990 --> 00:25:52.310
that top part nice and cold.

421
00:25:52.670 --> 00:25:55.790
And sometimes I get tech support calls and they're like,
Hey,

422
00:25:55.791 --> 00:25:58.550
my film and keeps jamming.
What's going on in this?

423
00:25:58.940 --> 00:26:02.600
And one of the first thing I started asking is,
is that fan on that top working?

424
00:26:02.720 --> 00:26:04.490
They're like,
no.

425
00:26:05.090 --> 00:26:09.320
So that usually means that it gets so much so hot up there that things are just

426
00:26:09.321 --> 00:26:12.740
getting stuck a way sooner and then the motor just can't handle it.

427
00:26:13.970 --> 00:26:18.870
Um,
and then the,
the next part up is the drive gear.
Uh,

428
00:26:18.871 --> 00:26:19.370
the drive,

429
00:26:19.370 --> 00:26:22.010
we call it the drive gear because it's kind of a gear and that kind of drives

430
00:26:22.011 --> 00:26:25.280
the filament down into it.
Um,
this is like an old fashioned one.

431
00:26:25.370 --> 00:26:28.200
I got a pass to one of these around.
You guys want to see it.
Um,

432
00:26:28.280 --> 00:26:32.270
this was like the really homemade three d printed version of an extruder,

433
00:26:32.900 --> 00:26:37.330
um,
around,
um,

434
00:26:38.300 --> 00:26:41.510
and that's,
uh,
one of my first prototypes.

435
00:26:41.511 --> 00:26:44.400
Use this because that was the easiest way.

436
00:26:44.401 --> 00:26:48.510
You could three d print a motor with a big gear and it created a lot more

437
00:26:48.511 --> 00:26:52.030
leverage and you can drive everything that way.
Um,

438
00:26:52.200 --> 00:26:55.950
now there are a lot more compact,
um,
like this one,
um,

439
00:26:56.160 --> 00:26:58.380
later if you guys want to come up and look at it,

440
00:26:58.770 --> 00:27:02.040
it has a drive gear here and you can see what's going on and how it works and

441
00:27:02.041 --> 00:27:05.430
everything.
Um,
but as you could see there,
it's pretty simple.

442
00:27:05.431 --> 00:27:09.900
It's the motor has the main gear part with the teeth and then there's an idler

443
00:27:09.901 --> 00:27:13.250
pulley that pushes that filament against it,
uh,

444
00:27:13.320 --> 00:27:17.610
with some good pressure from that spring.
And so that way it's a,
you know,

445
00:27:17.650 --> 00:27:20.580
it has a good grip on it.
And these drive gears,

446
00:27:20.581 --> 00:27:24.050
the golden ones that you see there,
uh,
they're actually brass,
but uh,

447
00:27:24.390 --> 00:27:27.030
those are the ones we manufacturer for this printer.

448
00:27:27.390 --> 00:27:31.860
And I specifically went to a manufacturer that makes gears and we,

449
00:27:31.890 --> 00:27:35.370
and I worked with them and we made these drive gears that are really sharp and

450
00:27:35.371 --> 00:27:40.140
digging really good.
And we created like one of the most reliable drive gears,
um,

451
00:27:40.230 --> 00:27:44.340
out there for three d printers.
All right.
Um,

452
00:27:44.400 --> 00:27:48.680
and now there's two different ways to extrude dysplastic.
There's kind of like a,

453
00:27:48.681 --> 00:27:51.930
a remote way of doing it and then a direct way to do it.

454
00:27:52.290 --> 00:27:57.290
And the remote way is called a bone and extruder and the direct way is just

455
00:27:57.511 --> 00:28:02.100
called direct drive.
Um,
the Bukito works in a boat and uh,

456
00:28:02.130 --> 00:28:03.060
extruder way.

457
00:28:03.480 --> 00:28:08.400
And the advantage of that is that you could put a nice heavy motor,
um,

458
00:28:08.490 --> 00:28:12.060
or heavier,
more complicated stuff.
I'm away from the,

459
00:28:12.210 --> 00:28:15.300
from the actual hot end itself,
so,

460
00:28:15.330 --> 00:28:19.920
so you could keep your head or your extruder or very light and having the

461
00:28:19.921 --> 00:28:24.330
extruder lay it makes,
makes things move faster and you could do a lot of,
uh,

462
00:28:24.480 --> 00:28:27.090
better mechanical stuff for that.
Um,

463
00:28:27.330 --> 00:28:32.290
the disadvantage of that is that you have,
uh,
a history sis,
uh,

464
00:28:32.430 --> 00:28:36.090
which means like a little delay.
You have a little bit of a delay every time the,

465
00:28:36.120 --> 00:28:39.330
the,
the,
the extruder motor pushes the filament,

466
00:28:39.780 --> 00:28:43.590
there's a little compression trickle compression going on and then it comes out.

467
00:28:44.070 --> 00:28:48.690
Um,
so in software you have to deal with the little bit more fine tuning of,
oh,

468
00:28:48.691 --> 00:28:53.250
it should start extruding right before it needs to extrude and then retract a

469
00:28:53.251 --> 00:28:54.990
little before it needs to retract this.

470
00:28:54.991 --> 00:28:58.480
There's a little delay between the extrusion here and there.
Um,

471
00:28:58.590 --> 00:29:02.690
but the Dura and the other disadvantage is that you can't,
uh,

472
00:29:03.030 --> 00:29:07.890
you can't run a flexible filaments,
uh,
through or not flexible.

473
00:29:07.910 --> 00:29:09.780
Uh,
very elastic filaments.

474
00:29:09.810 --> 00:29:13.860
There's some filaments that are very rubbery and if you try to push him through

475
00:29:13.861 --> 00:29:14.251
a tube,

476
00:29:14.251 --> 00:29:17.460
they're just going to kind of create a lot of friction and expand and bunch up

477
00:29:17.461 --> 00:29:21.540
and just get stuck there and it just won't come out to the other end.
Um,

478
00:29:21.541 --> 00:29:26.110
so a direct drive means the extruders right next to the nozzle.
Um,

479
00:29:26.470 --> 00:29:29.240
kind of like the one you're passing on this side.
Like the,

480
00:29:29.241 --> 00:29:32.760
the drive systems goes right down into the barrel.
And that's the,

481
00:29:32.810 --> 00:29:36.210
the advantage of that is that you could print very flexible filaments cause

482
00:29:36.300 --> 00:29:38.610
there's really not a lot where it could go or bunch up.

483
00:29:38.611 --> 00:29:42.170
It's just going right straight down that hot end.
All right.

484
00:29:43.200 --> 00:29:47.740
Um,
cool.
Um,
and then there's machines that have multi extruders.

485
00:29:47.800 --> 00:29:48.610
Uh,

486
00:29:48.610 --> 00:29:53.590
when we started I created a dual extruder machine and found out a lot of

487
00:29:53.591 --> 00:29:58.150
technical,
uh,
technical issues with doing that.
It's very difficult.

488
00:29:58.210 --> 00:30:02.370
Um,
but now they're coming up with different ways of doing it.
Um,
the,

489
00:30:02.371 --> 00:30:06.580
the more brute force way of doing it is the like the top one.
It's a,

490
00:30:06.590 --> 00:30:11.590
there's just four nozzles there and you have for the extruder motors driving the

491
00:30:11.960 --> 00:30:15.850
and extruding and you have software dealing with which one should extreme,
uh,

492
00:30:15.880 --> 00:30:17.560
first.
Um,

493
00:30:17.950 --> 00:30:22.000
the disadvantage about that is that every nozzle and this type of setup has to

494
00:30:22.001 --> 00:30:23.950
be exactly in the exact same height.

495
00:30:24.430 --> 00:30:27.310
So if one's tightened a little harder and the other one's going to be higher or

496
00:30:27.311 --> 00:30:28.144
lower than the other,

497
00:30:28.480 --> 00:30:33.480
and that means if one's printing another of those nozzles might knock over what

498
00:30:33.791 --> 00:30:36.850
you're trying to print or vice versa.
When the other one prints,

499
00:30:36.851 --> 00:30:38.330
the other one's going to knock over the other one.

500
00:30:38.740 --> 00:30:41.260
And that was a very big challenge.

501
00:30:41.261 --> 00:30:43.930
So people start coming up with the ones like the other one,

502
00:30:44.290 --> 00:30:48.430
which is like one nozzle and they feed three filaments through it.

503
00:30:48.940 --> 00:30:53.350
Um,
the disadvantage about that is that now you can't do different materials,

504
00:30:53.830 --> 00:30:57.700
uh,
mostly because you only have one heat source and they all have to be the same

505
00:30:57.701 --> 00:31:02.440
time.
Sure,
sure.
Um,
and then,
uh,
there's other methods of doing it.

506
00:31:02.470 --> 00:31:05.320
This one is pretty new and it's getting popular,

507
00:31:05.620 --> 00:31:10.620
but he basically got one extruder and then a fee all lines feeding into that one

508
00:31:11.380 --> 00:31:12.190
also.

509
00:31:12.190 --> 00:31:16.630
But he created this little board that you can adapt to your current printer and

510
00:31:16.631 --> 00:31:19.900
it just gets a signal and it figures out how to retract one and then feed the

511
00:31:19.901 --> 00:31:20.740
other one into it.

512
00:31:21.070 --> 00:31:24.670
And it could actually change temperatures every time it does that.
Um,

513
00:31:24.700 --> 00:31:27.220
because only one film it's going through at a time,

514
00:31:27.221 --> 00:31:30.520
but it has a very clever switching mechanism,

515
00:31:30.521 --> 00:31:35.440
like for a more software combination to do to that.
All right.

516
00:31:35.610 --> 00:31:36.010
Uh,

517
00:31:36.010 --> 00:31:41.010
and then another little important thing about a extruders is that there are some

518
00:31:41.381 --> 00:31:44.020
materials like pla that you're using.
If you notice here,

519
00:31:44.021 --> 00:31:45.370
there's another little fan on,

520
00:31:45.670 --> 00:31:49.450
on the machine here that some materials like to be cooled down as soon as they

521
00:31:49.451 --> 00:31:51.580
come out of the nozzle.
Um,

522
00:31:51.640 --> 00:31:54.490
and the reason for pla is that when you cool down,

523
00:31:54.491 --> 00:31:56.740
it becomes very hard and stiff immediately.

524
00:31:56.890 --> 00:32:01.780
So the next layer could go on it very smoothly and evenly and they won't,

525
00:32:01.810 --> 00:32:05.980
they won't affect each other.
Some other materials like abs plastic,

526
00:32:05.981 --> 00:32:10.660
which is like Lego plastic,
um,
they,
they need to be kept warm.
Actually,

527
00:32:10.661 --> 00:32:14.530
it's complete opposite.
They need to be kept warm and hot.
Um,
if not,

528
00:32:14.531 --> 00:32:18.040
the layer on the bottom shrinks so much that the next layer up shrinks a little

529
00:32:18.041 --> 00:32:21.010
bit and it starts curling up all the bottom layers under that.

530
00:32:21.011 --> 00:32:25.360
And it creates a really bad chain reaction,
um,
during your print.

531
00:32:26.920 --> 00:32:30.610
Um,
and then so the other part of the three printers,
your platform,

532
00:32:30.611 --> 00:32:34.960
that's where everything starts.
Um,
and this is,
uh,

533
00:32:35.500 --> 00:32:38.230
this is the tricky part.
It depends on what you're trying to print.

534
00:32:38.350 --> 00:32:42.750
A lot of materials have different surfaces that it likes to work on.
Um,

535
00:32:42.770 --> 00:32:45.750
the most common one is to use a heated platform,
uh,

536
00:32:45.800 --> 00:32:47.690
which is just like a hot plate,
but it's

537
00:32:47.880 --> 00:32:49.820
<v 3>uh,
uh,</v>

538
00:32:50.910 --> 00:32:55.470
<v 2>and it's made specifically to get pretty hot for abs plastic.</v>

539
00:32:56.540 --> 00:33:00.340
I'll pass this around.
These are some materials,
um,

540
00:33:01.530 --> 00:33:04.380
for abs plastic you need to keep it very warm.

541
00:33:04.381 --> 00:33:07.620
So this is like one of the hot plates that we use.
Um,

542
00:33:07.680 --> 00:33:11.730
and it likes to stick on a capped on tape might take,
which is like this one.

543
00:33:12.670 --> 00:33:13.503
<v 3>MMM.</v>

544
00:33:13.880 --> 00:33:17.660
<v 2>So those kind of go together.
And then,
uh,
there's nylon,</v>

545
00:33:18.080 --> 00:33:22.940
nylon and uh,
other materials like PETG that like other materials,

546
00:33:22.941 --> 00:33:25.460
this is a nylon plate for nylon to stick on.

547
00:33:25.850 --> 00:33:27.680
And actually I didn't peel this away,

548
00:33:29.220 --> 00:33:30.053
<v 3>but uh,</v>

549
00:33:30.490 --> 00:33:33.760
<v 2>this is another material that we're starting to use now that's very,</v>

550
00:33:33.870 --> 00:33:38.870
it's very high tech and it seems to stick to a lot more materials than just one

551
00:33:39.371 --> 00:33:40.204
or the other.

552
00:33:41.980 --> 00:33:42.660
<v 3>No.</v>

553
00:33:42.660 --> 00:33:45.150
<v 2>Um,
so this is kind of an example of some thing,</v>

554
00:33:45.180 --> 00:33:48.450
some things that are out there to,
to do different,
uh,

555
00:33:49.650 --> 00:33:54.000
uh,
different materials for them to add heat to the platform.
Um,

556
00:33:54.060 --> 00:33:56.010
the black one is like a commercially available.

557
00:33:56.011 --> 00:34:01.011
It's actually I think a polycarbonate and no one likes to stick to pla and abs

558
00:34:01.351 --> 00:34:02.220
when it's really hot.

559
00:34:02.600 --> 00:34:07.410
I'm the blue tape is what we use for three d with printers for pla that don't

560
00:34:07.411 --> 00:34:09.660
have a heated platform.
Um,

561
00:34:10.380 --> 00:34:14.820
the blue tape is actually the normal three m scotch tape they use for masking

562
00:34:14.821 --> 00:34:17.400
when you paint.
Um,
for summary,

563
00:34:17.401 --> 00:34:22.340
somebody found out that was the best type of tape that bla likes to stick to.
Um,

564
00:34:22.530 --> 00:34:26.920
the funny thing is only the three m scotch brand seems to work the best.
Uh,

565
00:34:27.000 --> 00:34:28.350
people have tried other formulas,

566
00:34:28.351 --> 00:34:31.920
other brands and stuff and it just doesn't work as nice.
Um,

567
00:34:32.030 --> 00:34:36.150
and at one point I met a guy that works at three m,
uh,

568
00:34:36.170 --> 00:34:38.940
at like a networking thing and uh,
I asked him like,
Hey,

569
00:34:38.941 --> 00:34:42.690
what do you guys do with the,
was a tape that it seems to work for this pla.

570
00:34:42.700 --> 00:34:43.291
He's like,
well,

571
00:34:43.291 --> 00:34:46.440
we have really proprietary chemicals to make that happen and we're not gonna

572
00:34:46.460 --> 00:34:51.300
tell you what they are.
So,
um,
the thing you think,
oh,

573
00:34:51.301 --> 00:34:54.990
well,
why would the surface of the,
the blue tape works so well?

574
00:34:55.260 --> 00:34:59.520
And what it is is that they actually have a special surface for that.

575
00:34:59.550 --> 00:35:03.930
So the adhesive of the tape on going on top of it in the role,
um,

576
00:35:04.260 --> 00:35:08.970
comes off of it without,
without sticking to that surface,
you know,

577
00:35:08.971 --> 00:35:12.570
it has that perfect the type of adhesion where it just works.

578
00:35:12.720 --> 00:35:16.230
So you could roll it off the role without it ripping apart or the adhesive going

579
00:35:16.231 --> 00:35:19.890
on the wrong side.
Um,
and then there's Polyman,
uh,
polyimide tape,

580
00:35:19.891 --> 00:35:23.970
which is the yellow stuff,
which I know JPL people see this all over the place.

581
00:35:24.360 --> 00:35:29.360
It's a very high temperature conductive tape that they use for electronics for

582
00:35:29.520 --> 00:35:32.970
things.
If you see things covered in like gold tape,
it's usually this stuff.

583
00:35:33.270 --> 00:35:36.990
It's called a capstone or polyimide tape.
And abs likes to,

584
00:35:37.230 --> 00:35:40.180
to that really well when it's heated.
Um,

585
00:35:40.530 --> 00:35:44.220
and then there's some materials like nylon,
uh,
which we could pass around leader.

586
00:35:44.250 --> 00:35:47.310
But a nylon likes porous materials.

587
00:35:47.610 --> 00:35:50.800
So unfortunately if you have a printer with Cap Dante,

588
00:35:50.820 --> 00:35:52.650
if you can't really print nylon on it,

589
00:35:52.651 --> 00:35:55.500
cause nylon doesn't like to stick to shiny stuff,
it likes poorest stuff.

590
00:35:55.800 --> 00:35:59.190
So some people just go and get really cheap wood on it or,

591
00:35:59.430 --> 00:36:04.430
or that other material that's called a linen phenolic that has a very micro pore

592
00:36:05.281 --> 00:36:09.810
in it and nylon likes to stick to it.
Um,
so every,

593
00:36:09.870 --> 00:36:13.700
every material likes its surface for some reason.
Um,

594
00:36:13.770 --> 00:36:17.940
and then the other important really part of a platform is how flat it is.

595
00:36:18.330 --> 00:36:22.800
Um,
I've always had people come up to us and they go,

596
00:36:23.130 --> 00:36:27.540
oh that's a cool printer,
but could you make a really big one?
And I'm like,
yeah,

597
00:36:27.541 --> 00:36:28.171
that's fine,

598
00:36:28.171 --> 00:36:32.460
but where are you going to get a flat piece of metal at the tolerances you want

599
00:36:32.461 --> 00:36:34.320
to be that big.
Um,

600
00:36:34.350 --> 00:36:37.530
and the only really good way to do that is to get one machine and that gets

601
00:36:37.531 --> 00:36:39.810
really expensive fast.
Um,

602
00:36:39.840 --> 00:36:43.770
so most pieces of metal that you get from the stock,
you know,

603
00:36:43.771 --> 00:36:46.590
after about 10 inches,
they just start their tolerances.

604
00:36:46.630 --> 00:36:50.160
Just go off out the door when you're trying to print,
you know,

605
00:36:50.190 --> 00:36:53.310
300 micron layers from one end to the other.

606
00:36:53.311 --> 00:36:56.850
It could be completely warped everywhere and you almost can't even look at it.

607
00:36:57.330 --> 00:37:00.020
And then some people go,
well,
why don't you put a big piece of glass on it?
Well,

608
00:37:00.540 --> 00:37:03.060
have you ever measured glass?
It's never perfect.

609
00:37:03.810 --> 00:37:07.320
Each site is a little thinner and thicker than other places.
So,
um,

610
00:37:07.530 --> 00:37:11.580
there's those challenges that you run into when you design a printer.
Um,

611
00:37:11.850 --> 00:37:12.391
there's a,

612
00:37:12.391 --> 00:37:15.420
there's these new methods coming out and getting more sophisticated where

613
00:37:15.421 --> 00:37:20.040
there's doubt printers that actually go in through and since your whole board

614
00:37:20.041 --> 00:37:24.330
with a sensor with like a metal detector basically,
and it creates,

615
00:37:24.510 --> 00:37:28.320
it's curviness and it compensates all your three d printing for it.

616
00:37:28.800 --> 00:37:33.150
Um,
like that orange machine with all the extruders.

617
00:37:33.420 --> 00:37:36.700
The guy that,
uh,
designed that one,
his name's pressure,
uh,

618
00:37:36.790 --> 00:37:39.660
Joseph pressure and he,
uh,

619
00:37:39.900 --> 00:37:44.790
he created a heated bed with special targets on it that he could run your

620
00:37:44.791 --> 00:37:47.340
software,
even if your printers like totally crooked,

621
00:37:47.820 --> 00:37:50.910
it'll go and find those dots and it'll create an,
the algorithm.

622
00:37:50.910 --> 00:37:54.000
And the compensation to just print your object straight as possible.

623
00:37:54.240 --> 00:37:57.720
Even no matter how quick you do your machine is,
it's pretty neat.
Um,

624
00:37:57.810 --> 00:38:00.750
but those are the challenges that you run into and creating a three d printer.

625
00:38:01.470 --> 00:38:05.610
Um,
and then the,
uh,
the next major component,
it was electronics.

626
00:38:06.180 --> 00:38:07.013
Um,

627
00:38:07.920 --> 00:38:12.260
and what the electronics basically do an a three d printer,
um,

628
00:38:12.470 --> 00:38:17.450
at Ge moved it was in third,
earlier should have been on the next line.
But,
uh,

629
00:38:17.900 --> 00:38:20.940
the electronics in this case out of the lower cost machines,

630
00:38:20.941 --> 00:38:24.750
they basically taken instructions and just convert that into movement.

631
00:38:25.080 --> 00:38:29.190
So the myth about three d printers is that three d printers have no idea they're

632
00:38:29.191 --> 00:38:31.950
even in three d space that could care less.

633
00:38:32.250 --> 00:38:37.250
All they do is get some instructions and move the motors and adjust heating and

634
00:38:37.900 --> 00:38:39.460
a pulse things.
And that's it.

635
00:38:39.820 --> 00:38:42.910
So you can't like throw a three d file out of three d printer printer and it

636
00:38:42.911 --> 00:38:44.290
knows what to do,
um,

637
00:38:44.410 --> 00:38:48.940
unless there's specific software to start to convert all that into movement.
Um,

638
00:38:49.120 --> 00:38:53.320
so that's what they do.
Um,
and usually what we use is,
uh,
microcontrollers.

639
00:38:53.740 --> 00:38:54.573
Um,

640
00:38:54.580 --> 00:38:59.350
is anybody here like work on our Dino's any Arduino people?
Yeah.

641
00:38:59.680 --> 00:39:02.290
Cool.
Um,
so in Arduino is a very,

642
00:39:02.291 --> 00:39:05.410
it's an open source platform that you could program your own electronics and a

643
00:39:05.411 --> 00:39:08.840
lot of these three d printers started in that way.
Um,
because,
uh,

644
00:39:08.940 --> 00:39:13.870
the software was there,
somebody wrote these,
uh,
from wires that had all the,

645
00:39:14.110 --> 00:39:17.110
the math and the algorithm and the settings,
uh,

646
00:39:17.200 --> 00:39:19.780
to work with three d printers and then all these boards started coming up.

647
00:39:20.080 --> 00:39:24.100
This is one of the boards we use a that's more sophisticated,

648
00:39:24.101 --> 00:39:27.970
that runs the same way as the old type of boards,
but it's all more compact.

649
00:39:29.150 --> 00:39:32.590
Um,
the cool thing about chips now is that they're getting better and better.

650
00:39:32.591 --> 00:39:37.000
And now were you starting to use more?
Arm chips were really fast.
Like this,

651
00:39:37.001 --> 00:39:40.570
a board is I think 16 megahertz.
Um,

652
00:39:40.630 --> 00:39:43.270
and it's like a normal,
like 16 bit bored.

653
00:39:43.630 --> 00:39:48.630
But now all the arm chips are like 64 bit or 32 in our like hundred megahertz.

654
00:39:49.060 --> 00:39:53.080
So now they can handle all the crazy precision floating point numbers.

655
00:39:53.081 --> 00:39:56.260
And all that stuff a lot easier.
And so like the delta,

656
00:39:56.261 --> 00:39:59.960
Michigan's take more advantage of that because I have to.
Um,

657
00:40:01.790 --> 00:40:05.570
but um,
this is like a,
a simple,
believe it or not,

658
00:40:05.571 --> 00:40:10.220
it's a simple diagram of what a three d printer uses on these microcontrollers.

659
00:40:10.580 --> 00:40:13.400
And you're all gonna get tested at the end of the day about this.
No,

660
00:40:13.401 --> 00:40:17.840
I'm just kidding.
Um,
but as you can see it,
it's pretty,
uh,

661
00:40:17.900 --> 00:40:21.590
pretty straight forward.
You have a bunch of chips that drive the motors,

662
00:40:21.591 --> 00:40:25.010
so they're special chips that actually handle all the current that the motor

663
00:40:25.011 --> 00:40:25.460
needs.

664
00:40:25.460 --> 00:40:29.930
And all the chip has to do is tell it to pulse and in what direction and tell it

665
00:40:29.931 --> 00:40:32.510
what direction should I go forward or backwards.
Um,

666
00:40:32.540 --> 00:40:36.830
but you have these little things called drivers that are a little mini chips

667
00:40:36.831 --> 00:40:39.400
that handle all the high current for the motors.
Um,

668
00:40:39.570 --> 00:40:44.270
and then you have mohs fats which control your heaters and then their sensors

669
00:40:44.271 --> 00:40:49.040
and a SD card reader and end stops.
And all these things are all controlled,
um,

670
00:40:49.130 --> 00:40:53.810
by the microcontroller.
And,
um,
oh,

671
00:40:54.020 --> 00:40:58.550
we're getting on time.
Um,
and then there's a,
a bunch of filaments.

672
00:40:58.910 --> 00:41:01.280
So after that you need materials to print with,
right?

673
00:41:01.281 --> 00:41:03.890
So these are some of the most,
uh,

674
00:41:04.190 --> 00:41:08.840
popular materials and you guys could check them out either later.

675
00:41:09.050 --> 00:41:10.940
Let me see.
Yeah,
we'll check them out later.

676
00:41:10.941 --> 00:41:13.430
But there's a lot of cool materials out there.
Um,

677
00:41:13.460 --> 00:41:15.200
and one of the newer ones that they're doing,

678
00:41:15.440 --> 00:41:18.410
which is kind of cool cause a lot of people are like,
oh,
can't you print metal?

679
00:41:18.710 --> 00:41:19.310
Um,

680
00:41:19.310 --> 00:41:23.210
with this type of printer you really can't print metal cause you route to print

681
00:41:23.211 --> 00:41:26.300
real metal,
you've got to melt it up thousand degrees or whatever.

682
00:41:26.720 --> 00:41:31.400
But they're doing filament with like pla or abs that have like metal in it.

683
00:41:31.670 --> 00:41:32.580
This is a,

684
00:41:32.581 --> 00:41:37.280
a normal that I did on a Bukito that has iron in it so it can be magnetized.

685
00:41:37.700 --> 00:41:41.720
So it's magnetic and it's like,
oh cool.
Oh that's something cool.

686
00:41:41.721 --> 00:41:44.810
So basically what they do is they just grind up really fine,
fine,

687
00:41:44.811 --> 00:41:48.930
fine metal powder,
and then mix that,
the good ratio with PLA.
Uh,

688
00:41:49.110 --> 00:41:53.610
so it's not strong like metal,
but it could act or look like metal.
Um,

689
00:41:53.670 --> 00:41:58.100
and then these are some of the materials that have to,
uh,
or the,

690
00:41:58.990 --> 00:42:01.730
uh,
that are popular.
Pla is the most popular.

691
00:42:01.731 --> 00:42:05.480
ABS is kind of getting the second popular,
but it's actually going to third.

692
00:42:05.780 --> 00:42:10.400
And PETG is a new material that's coming up,
which is water bottle,

693
00:42:10.401 --> 00:42:14.660
plastic type of material.
It's very strong.
It's a lot easier to print than ABS,

694
00:42:14.670 --> 00:42:18.170
so you don't need a crazy heated bed to reach 110 degrees.

695
00:42:18.171 --> 00:42:20.600
You only need it to about 80 degrees.
Um,

696
00:42:20.660 --> 00:42:24.320
and then there's like flexible materials nylons and then the wood and metal

697
00:42:24.321 --> 00:42:27.920
fills and you'll see samples of that here.
All right.

698
00:42:28.490 --> 00:42:29.990
And um,
yeah,

699
00:42:29.991 --> 00:42:32.840
so what's important about the filaments is that each one has like its

700
00:42:32.841 --> 00:42:36.020
characteristics of how it likes to be printed.
Um,

701
00:42:36.021 --> 00:42:39.110
so there's different types obviously,
but the settings are important.

702
00:42:39.111 --> 00:42:43.700
The temperatures,
the speeds,
the platform surface is important.

703
00:42:43.701 --> 00:42:45.740
Depends on what you're doing.
Some people are like,
oh,

704
00:42:45.741 --> 00:42:48.710
I print pla and then they put abs and there and their falls off and it's not

705
00:42:48.711 --> 00:42:52.640
working.
They're like,
why isn't it working?
Uh,
not all materials work the same.

706
00:42:52.641 --> 00:42:55.550
And not all material stick to the same things or act the same way.

707
00:42:55.580 --> 00:42:59.630
So that's something to look forward,
uh,
to understand.

708
00:42:59.990 --> 00:43:03.140
And then there's the retraction thing.
Um,

709
00:43:03.460 --> 00:43:08.360
each material has a certain way of liquid,
a liquid fighting through the nozzle.

710
00:43:08.690 --> 00:43:12.260
And sometime when you want to move from point to point without extruding,

711
00:43:12.261 --> 00:43:14.360
you've got to kind of suck in that material and move.

712
00:43:14.720 --> 00:43:16.490
And that's where retraction comes in.

713
00:43:16.920 --> 00:43:20.120
So if you see prince and you see all these little like fine little lines and

714
00:43:20.121 --> 00:43:23.990
stuff,
either it was raining too hot or the retraction wasn't set right.

715
00:43:25.110 --> 00:43:29.870
There we go.
Um,
so some of you guys,

716
00:43:29.871 --> 00:43:32.270
uh,
already dealt with three d printing at some point.

717
00:43:32.720 --> 00:43:35.780
Did you guys deal with the software end of it?
Uh,

718
00:43:35.781 --> 00:43:39.050
as far as the slicing end of it,
by chance,

719
00:43:39.170 --> 00:43:42.280
how many of you have worked with the slicer part of it?
I mean,

720
00:43:42.290 --> 00:43:46.490
you guys know what slicer is.
Okay,
cool.
Well,

721
00:43:46.491 --> 00:43:48.140
what the slicer is.
Um,

722
00:43:49.220 --> 00:43:51.500
and what I did is I did a talk,

723
00:43:51.501 --> 00:43:54.710
that's where these slides are from of a open source software because a lot of

724
00:43:54.711 --> 00:43:59.420
the slicer software,
which is the software that grabs your 3-d file,

725
00:43:59.720 --> 00:44:04.250
um,
and slices and creates code is a lot of it's open source and uh,

726
00:44:04.720 --> 00:44:09.110
and it's pretty cool stuff.
Um,
so I talked about that,
give some market stuff.

727
00:44:09.370 --> 00:44:14.120
Um,
but this is a quick workflow of uh,
of what,
how three d printers were,

728
00:44:14.210 --> 00:44:18.900
right.
You start with the three d model.
I'm sorry,

729
00:44:19.300 --> 00:44:23.600
it was a little fancier than it probably should be.
Um,
uh,

730
00:44:23.690 --> 00:44:27.250
you place it into the software and the position,
um,

731
00:44:27.770 --> 00:44:31.320
like where like how big you want it.
If you want more,
more than one,

732
00:44:31.321 --> 00:44:34.520
you can fill up your whole platform with three d objects basically.
Um,

733
00:44:34.550 --> 00:44:36.270
and then after that with the,

734
00:44:36.330 --> 00:44:40.080
you set your settings up and then that creates what's called a g code.
Um,

735
00:44:40.170 --> 00:44:43.020
and that's basically all the simple instructions of hey,

736
00:44:43.021 --> 00:44:45.890
heat the temperature up to this,
move the,

737
00:44:45.891 --> 00:44:49.020
the extruder from here to here with this much amount of volume.

738
00:44:49.021 --> 00:44:52.470
And things like that.
Um,
and then after that you,
uh,

739
00:44:53.310 --> 00:44:57.200
you get that,
that,
uh,
instructions,
uh,

740
00:44:57.370 --> 00:45:00.330
that it generates and then you send it to the printer basically,

741
00:45:00.690 --> 00:45:05.690
and either a USB form or a micro SD card in this case or another of wireless.

742
00:45:06.690 --> 00:45:11.100
And some you could connect directly to your computer and run it that way.
Um,

743
00:45:12.450 --> 00:45:14.610
so STL models,

744
00:45:14.640 --> 00:45:19.440
anybody here write software or deal with three d software?
Three d space?

745
00:45:19.770 --> 00:45:24.120
A little bit,
yeah.
Cool.
Um,
I don't know if you guys deal with STL files,

746
00:45:24.121 --> 00:45:28.980
but STL files is like the lowest common denominator of three d printing,

747
00:45:28.981 --> 00:45:33.120
I would call it.
Um,
it's basically when your object is just a bunch of triangles,

748
00:45:33.420 --> 00:45:38.160
um,
to create your solid model,
um,
that then the slicer uses to,

749
00:45:38.250 --> 00:45:43.230
to figure out how to slice it up.
Um,
so it's Kinda a works,
uh,

750
00:45:44.250 --> 00:45:48.780
uh,
an STL is basically a pure,
uh,
object made of triangles.

751
00:45:48.870 --> 00:45:51.600
So there's no,
uh,
there's no curves,

752
00:45:51.601 --> 00:45:55.440
there's no other instructions of how actually what the scale is.

753
00:45:55.770 --> 00:45:57.870
The computer doesn't know what,
how big it is.

754
00:45:57.871 --> 00:46:01.060
It's just a number is a number and a triangles,
a triangle.
Um,

755
00:46:01.110 --> 00:46:05.640
that's how it usually STL.
So they're a little very,
very simplified.
Um,

756
00:46:05.641 --> 00:46:07.200
so sometimes you might be in a,

757
00:46:07.201 --> 00:46:10.740
the slicer software and you bring in your object and it was like super tiny.

758
00:46:10.770 --> 00:46:11.970
You're like,
why is it so small?

759
00:46:12.450 --> 00:46:16.910
And basically that means somebody exported it like into the inches realm.
Um,

760
00:46:16.980 --> 00:46:20.610
so,
uh,
and then the software,
the slicing works in millimeters.

761
00:46:20.610 --> 00:46:22.680
So I think so a one inch was one millimeter,

762
00:46:23.190 --> 00:46:26.730
so it's like completely reduced or vice versa.

763
00:46:26.760 --> 00:46:30.360
Sometimes if your software deals with inches and your models like enormous,

764
00:46:30.361 --> 00:46:35.160
that means it dealt with millimeters instead.
Um,
so that's about STL files.

765
00:46:35.880 --> 00:46:40.860
Um,
but you guys get this really fast because it's software based.
So let me,
uh,

766
00:46:41.740 --> 00:46:46.320
move forward.
Um,
so

767
00:46:48.300 --> 00:46:51.630
I mean,
let me actually run software.
Um,

768
00:46:52.050 --> 00:46:55.380
so cure is one of the most of the more popular a softwares.

769
00:46:55.381 --> 00:46:58.470
And I know Scott uses it.
Um,

770
00:46:58.530 --> 00:47:01.440
so this is kind of what the software looks like.
It's pretty simple.

771
00:47:01.441 --> 00:47:05.860
It has a bunch of settings.
Um,
what we do is we,
uh,

772
00:47:05.880 --> 00:47:09.120
since it's open source,
we ha we say to our customer and go,
Hey,

773
00:47:09.450 --> 00:47:11.400
here's the link for Kira,
download it.

774
00:47:11.640 --> 00:47:14.190
And then we give them the set of what's called profiles,

775
00:47:15.030 --> 00:47:18.420
which are all the settings for your machine.
Um,

776
00:47:18.421 --> 00:47:22.300
so you kinda just go up and open your profile.
Um,

777
00:47:22.950 --> 00:47:27.950
in this case we'll do a shortcut and we'll figure something out like pla and

778
00:47:28.441 --> 00:47:32.080
that sets all these settings.
And uh,
in this software,

779
00:47:32.081 --> 00:47:33.850
the first panel is basically all the,

780
00:47:33.880 --> 00:47:37.570
most of the settings that you end up kind of changing dynamically according to

781
00:47:37.571 --> 00:47:42.400
what part you're printing,
um,
like your layer resolution.
Um,

782
00:47:42.790 --> 00:47:44.920
did you guys read that?
Okay.
It's kind of small,

783
00:47:45.820 --> 00:47:48.350
but basically the first one is your layer heighth.

784
00:47:48.730 --> 00:47:51.940
And what slicing software does basically it grabbed your three d model,

785
00:47:52.360 --> 00:47:57.070
chops it up into whatever your layer heights you select until like flat two

786
00:47:57.071 --> 00:48:01.330
dimensional pictures basically.
And then after that it grabs a,

787
00:48:01.500 --> 00:48:03.590
it gets the rest of your settings.
Uh,

788
00:48:03.670 --> 00:48:07.210
like how thick do you want your walls and how thick the top and bottoms are.

789
00:48:07.480 --> 00:48:12.480
And it gets those two d slices and then it starts creating a tool path of where

790
00:48:13.301 --> 00:48:17.350
the printer should be laying down material and how much material.
Um,

791
00:48:17.370 --> 00:48:21.460
so if all your settings are our perfect,
you'll get objects like this.

792
00:48:22.360 --> 00:48:23.530
Um,
the,

793
00:48:23.740 --> 00:48:26.470
the thing about it is that if you're one of your settings are a little off,

794
00:48:26.770 --> 00:48:31.360
your volume of extrusion can be completely,
completely wrong.

795
00:48:31.650 --> 00:48:36.040
Um,
it gave a extruded weigh too much or not extreme enough.
Um,

796
00:48:36.041 --> 00:48:40.270
so all these settings are pretty important to make sure they're a adjusted to

797
00:48:40.271 --> 00:48:44.170
the machine you're using and the material you're using and everything.
Um,

798
00:48:44.230 --> 00:48:46.040
so that's the software end of things.
Uh,

799
00:48:46.090 --> 00:48:50.970
there's also advanced features obviously for fine tuning the speeds,
um,

800
00:48:51.120 --> 00:48:55.480
the accelerations,
um,
the temperatures,
all that stuff,

801
00:48:55.481 --> 00:48:57.790
you could find tune the retracting,
uh,

802
00:48:58.000 --> 00:49:00.550
like we talked about that you've got to retract every time it moves from end to

803
00:49:00.551 --> 00:49:05.260
end.
Um,
yeah.
And then sometimes like in this one,

804
00:49:05.261 --> 00:49:08.320
they actually have a different setting for just the first layer.

805
00:49:08.650 --> 00:49:11.580
So if you have a printer that has like blue tape or something,

806
00:49:11.590 --> 00:49:16.300
you want a little extra extrusion on that first layer,
it will do that cause you,

807
00:49:16.320 --> 00:49:19.450
uh,
it's very important in three d printer that your foundation,
your first layer,

808
00:49:19.550 --> 00:49:23.790
it comes out good.
Or else the risk of might not not be well,
you know,
if a,

809
00:49:23.810 --> 00:49:27.190
if you build a house and they screw up your foundation cement,

810
00:49:27.580 --> 00:49:31.720
your house might not stand up very well.
So it's kind of the same concept.
Um,

811
00:49:31.780 --> 00:49:36.340
and then there's some cool software features that some,

812
00:49:36.880 --> 00:49:39.940
some uh,
some of these softwares do and one of them is called a,

813
00:49:40.510 --> 00:49:44.650
it's called a spiralize outer contour.
Um,
and this is a cool feature.

814
00:49:44.651 --> 00:49:47.650
I came a while back and now they're,
they're making it really neat.

815
00:49:47.910 --> 00:49:48.820
And what it is is a,

816
00:49:48.821 --> 00:49:53.320
if you have a solid model that's solid everywhere and doesn't have any weird

817
00:49:53.321 --> 00:49:55.000
spaces,
um,

818
00:49:55.030 --> 00:49:59.860
what this setting or a feature does is that it will print you a nice solid base

819
00:49:59.861 --> 00:50:03.370
first.
But then on the walls,
um,

820
00:50:03.400 --> 00:50:05.170
if you could imagine the normal printing,

821
00:50:05.200 --> 00:50:08.920
you print one layer and move up and print the next layer and then move up with

822
00:50:08.921 --> 00:50:13.480
this spiral of feature does is it actually prints continuously as a spiral.

823
00:50:13.840 --> 00:50:18.840
So every little segment it moves up a real tiny micron up on the z.

824
00:50:19.420 --> 00:50:24.420
So it just creates an infinite kind of like spiral effect that gives you,

825
00:50:24.611 --> 00:50:26.800
um,
I don't know if I have anything printed with it,

826
00:50:27.380 --> 00:50:30.470
but it gives you a kind of like a vase cause you can only print the outside of

827
00:50:30.471 --> 00:50:32.900
that with one thickness obviously.
Um,

828
00:50:32.960 --> 00:50:37.610
but it gives you a very smooth looking basis with no seams and the resolution

829
00:50:37.611 --> 00:50:41.600
looks a lot sharper to,
um,
it's a very interesting thing to do.
Um,

830
00:50:41.630 --> 00:50:44.450
so basically mathematically they grab the,
the,

831
00:50:44.480 --> 00:50:48.500
I guess the layers and then they split the segments of the layers into the layer

832
00:50:48.501 --> 00:50:49.580
height itself.

833
00:50:50.000 --> 00:50:54.140
So if you have a 0.3 millimeter layer and you have 500 segments,

834
00:50:54.560 --> 00:50:57.890
you'd divide that by 500 segments and it makes food to do little by little.

835
00:50:58.330 --> 00:50:59.600
Makes it cool little.
Uh,

836
00:50:59.601 --> 00:51:02.810
and so your object comes out really neat and it's a continuous and actually

837
00:51:02.811 --> 00:51:05.540
prince pretty fast.
Um,

838
00:51:06.530 --> 00:51:08.390
so the,

839
00:51:08.810 --> 00:51:13.310
the quick way to like use this software as you just get like a,
an STL,

840
00:51:13.730 --> 00:51:17.840
uh,
you kind of loaded up
like that.

841
00:51:17.900 --> 00:51:21.530
Now if it comes inside ways,
depends on your software,
you could always rotate it.

842
00:51:22.370 --> 00:51:27.080
So it just kinda just kinda rotate it pretty easily.
Right?

843
00:51:27.650 --> 00:51:30.350
Um,
and in this case,
this type of software slices,

844
00:51:30.351 --> 00:51:33.830
you could see the corner up here,
it kind of slices really fast.
Um,

845
00:51:33.890 --> 00:51:36.680
every time you change a setting and it starts to a slice again so you don't have

846
00:51:36.681 --> 00:51:41.030
to wait for it or hit a button and then it tells you how long it would take and

847
00:51:41.031 --> 00:51:42.230
everything.
Um,

848
00:51:42.260 --> 00:51:45.920
and then you could actually preview what it would kind of look like with all

849
00:51:45.921 --> 00:51:49.310
those paths,
those what's called tool path,

850
00:51:49.311 --> 00:51:53.150
which is where the head moves and where it's going to move and where it's gonna

851
00:51:53.330 --> 00:51:55.970
go faster and slower and all that.
So if you hit layers,

852
00:51:55.971 --> 00:51:59.730
you'll see the effect of that.
Um,
my computer,

853
00:51:59.731 --> 00:52:04.400
it's probably not too fast on this,
but actually this is a pretty big part.
But,

854
00:52:04.430 --> 00:52:08.390
uh,
if you look down deep,
you could start seeing the features of this.

855
00:52:11.440 --> 00:52:12.400
<v 3>Oops.
Too much.</v>

856
00:52:16.930 --> 00:52:19.750
We're going to go or they haven't totally upside down.

857
00:52:23.040 --> 00:52:27.340
Okay.
There we go.
All right.

858
00:52:27.470 --> 00:52:32.470
<v 2>I'm going to change to a smaller part because this is choking the processor.</v>

859
00:52:34.540 --> 00:52:38.680
<v 3>Um,
let's do them all objects.</v>

860
00:52:39.550 --> 00:52:40.380
Um,

861
00:52:40.380 --> 00:52:43.500
<v 2>game of Thrones is a little too complex.
You could see one that's there.</v>

862
00:52:43.710 --> 00:52:45.990
Anybody Watch game of Thrones?
Yeah,

863
00:52:46.110 --> 00:52:49.980
we had a little game of Thrones chair or they don't sit on it cause it's very

864
00:52:49.981 --> 00:52:53.490
sharp.
Uh,

865
00:52:54.720 --> 00:52:57.450
let's see.
Let's do something similar.

866
00:52:57.500 --> 00:53:01.400
<v 3>Bull Castle,</v>

867
00:53:01.401 --> 00:53:03.390
maybe it's all small one.

868
00:53:05.490 --> 00:53:08.850
<v 2>Cool.
So this is a castle,
I guess.
Very simple.</v>

869
00:53:09.580 --> 00:53:10.413
<v 3>MMM.</v>

870
00:53:11.800 --> 00:53:16.660
<v 2>Slicing.
And then you could see,
uh,
how the layers would look like.</v>

871
00:53:16.661 --> 00:53:20.320
And this is just a preview and it's kind of just outlining stuff.

872
00:53:21.040 --> 00:53:25.220
Um,
now I actually,
I asked Scott about this,
but,
uh,

873
00:53:25.260 --> 00:53:29.070
I guess Google is not working on any type of three d software that I know of or

874
00:53:29.071 --> 00:53:31.260
anything.
But I think you guys should,

875
00:53:31.860 --> 00:53:34.140
there's a lot of improvements we could use in this world,

876
00:53:34.770 --> 00:53:39.180
in this realm of technology.
But,
uh,
as you can see,
um,

877
00:53:39.210 --> 00:53:43.650
you could change slicing settings,
um,
and you can actually see them happen,

878
00:53:43.651 --> 00:53:47.280
which is kind of neat.
Um,
so if I,
so,

879
00:53:48.060 --> 00:53:49.890
so in general,
this type of three d printing,

880
00:53:49.891 --> 00:53:53.100
you don't want to print hundred percent solid objects,
right?

881
00:53:53.101 --> 00:53:54.930
So there's the infill setting,

882
00:53:55.110 --> 00:53:57.750
which creates like some kind of grid or a honeycomb.

883
00:53:57.990 --> 00:53:59.790
Some softwares have different options for that.

884
00:54:00.120 --> 00:54:03.720
And that kind of just fills in a lot of the gaps.
So your object strong,

885
00:54:03.721 --> 00:54:08.670
but it's not 100% plastic and it uses up your whole roll of material.
Um,

886
00:54:08.700 --> 00:54:11.840
so this is something you could like,
just change up like that.
Um,

887
00:54:12.300 --> 00:54:16.170
and I'll re slice it,
um,
and then you'll see it happening.
Uh,

888
00:54:16.530 --> 00:54:19.890
see what it looks like.
So according to your object,
like a,

889
00:54:20.100 --> 00:54:24.480
this was probably a solid object when you got it.
Yeah.
So it's probably solid,

890
00:54:24.481 --> 00:54:27.750
but in this case,
what he did is it just said,
hey,
don't put any in,
fill in it.

891
00:54:28.170 --> 00:54:31.790
And so you get like a cup or a vase and then he'd say,

892
00:54:31.830 --> 00:54:34.620
don't print the top party there and you could set all these settings and

893
00:54:34.621 --> 00:54:37.710
sophomores.
Um,
cool.

894
00:54:37.800 --> 00:54:41.400
Well there it is or as they unfold with the change that I made.
Um,

895
00:54:41.460 --> 00:54:43.470
but I think since we're kind of at a time,

896
00:54:43.650 --> 00:54:48.650
let's open it up for any questions and we could get into that if you guys like

897
00:54:49.650 --> 00:54:51.330
you guys have any questions but

898
00:54:53.470 --> 00:54:54.303
<v 1>okay.</v>

899
00:54:56.280 --> 00:54:57.870
<v 2>I know all you guys are doing important work,</v>

900
00:54:57.871 --> 00:54:59.910
so I don't want to hold you guys from their job,
but uh,

901
00:55:00.360 --> 00:55:01.560
I'll be here as long as you guys need.

902
00:55:02.370 --> 00:55:05.490
So do you guys have any questions that you guys might want to talk about here?

903
00:55:05.700 --> 00:55:08.970
Yeah,
go ahead.
Yeah.
Okay.
That'd be cool.

904
00:55:10.620 --> 00:55:11.900
Thanks for the talk.
Um,

905
00:55:11.910 --> 00:55:16.320
so what true events your competitors from copying you from copying the machine?

906
00:55:16.530 --> 00:55:21.480
Uh,
technically nothing.
Um,
I actually on this machine in my previous one,

907
00:55:21.481 --> 00:55:26.070
I actually made him open source.
Um,
so I'm on this one.

908
00:55:26.490 --> 00:55:29.340
I hesitated,
I didn't,
uh,
I call it open source.

909
00:55:29.341 --> 00:55:33.240
I didn't root quite publish all the parts on it,
but if anybody asks me,

910
00:55:33.241 --> 00:55:35.880
I willingly totally give it to him.
Um,

911
00:55:35.910 --> 00:55:39.360
and mainly I did this to kind of slow down a little bit of people just copying

912
00:55:39.361 --> 00:55:42.990
myself because unfortunately China actually made one just like mine.

913
00:55:43.500 --> 00:55:46.110
I'm not as good obviously,
but,
uh,

914
00:55:46.111 --> 00:55:50.520
they copied a lot of the same things and they made it super cheap and it's

915
00:55:50.521 --> 00:55:54.960
unreliable and people complaining about it,
but that's the way it works.
Um,

916
00:55:54.990 --> 00:55:59.370
but on these machines,
I did create the,
cause I started in open source,

917
00:56:00.360 --> 00:56:03.000
the first machine I got,
it was a,
it's called Persia Mendel,

918
00:56:03.001 --> 00:56:06.390
and it was all open source and I bought a kid and I built it.

919
00:56:06.391 --> 00:56:07.111
And because of that,

920
00:56:07.111 --> 00:56:11.040
I learned so much about how to build my machine that I felt like I wanted to,

921
00:56:11.160 --> 00:56:15.300
you know,
pass the,
pay it forward basically.
So all my machines,

922
00:56:15.720 --> 00:56:19.830
uh,
since this one I've opened,
uh,
the first machine,

923
00:56:19.831 --> 00:56:21.240
I actually published all the files.

924
00:56:21.241 --> 00:56:24.730
They're all on our wiki and they're all there.
Um,
on this one,

925
00:56:25.300 --> 00:56:26.590
I published some things here and there,

926
00:56:26.591 --> 00:56:29.590
but if anybody ever asked and they're like,
hey,
could I have your file of law?

927
00:56:29.590 --> 00:56:34.210
I'm just,
I just give them the source files.
Uh,
nope,
no problem about that.
Um,

928
00:56:34.240 --> 00:56:35.780
so fortunately,
no,
no,
I,

929
00:56:35.830 --> 00:56:39.730
there's nothing to stop people from doing it except the fact that open source

930
00:56:39.731 --> 00:56:43.120
doesn't mean you could make money off of it,
but that's extremely,

931
00:56:43.500 --> 00:56:45.970
very expensive to stop.
So it's not worth it.

932
00:56:46.210 --> 00:56:50.500
Usually what I w I always like to,
my philosophy is always,

933
00:56:50.860 --> 00:56:54.010
you know,
it,
let's innovate,
let's put out the products,
uh,

934
00:56:54.040 --> 00:56:57.430
let's make money and to make more innovative products and keep ahead of the

935
00:56:57.431 --> 00:57:01.110
curve as much as possible and just kinda keep going.
Um,

936
00:57:01.150 --> 00:57:02.800
so that's kind of my philosophy of trying to work.

937
00:57:02.801 --> 00:57:07.780
So cause people are going to copy it no matter what,
uh,
one way or another,

938
00:57:07.781 --> 00:57:09.880
especially stuff that they could just buy off the shelf.

939
00:57:10.210 --> 00:57:11.920
They'll measure it and make their own and that's it.

940
00:57:12.180 --> 00:57:17.140
So there's not a lot of stuff you could patent on this.
Uh,
also,
which goes a few,

941
00:57:17.170 --> 00:57:21.190
a little bit of the history is,
um,
uh,

942
00:57:21.250 --> 00:57:25.360
three d printing was actually invented in the mid eighties.
Um,

943
00:57:25.420 --> 00:57:29.800
and sometimes I start my talks like that and people are like,
Whoa,
where was it?

944
00:57:30.010 --> 00:57:34.150
I go,
we know,
they know about it.
And what happened isn't it about,
about,

945
00:57:34.240 --> 00:57:36.700
I think about eight,
nine years ago,

946
00:57:37.120 --> 00:57:41.770
the main patents for this and some other one's expired because they were

947
00:57:41.771 --> 00:57:46.540
patented around 84 and they made it as long as possible and to take about 25

948
00:57:46.541 --> 00:57:49.110
years for them to expire.
And once they expired,

949
00:57:49.111 --> 00:57:50.860
that's where the explosion happened.

950
00:57:50.861 --> 00:57:55.750
Because those companies that had those patents never took advantage of like the

951
00:57:55.751 --> 00:57:58.570
consumer level three d printing because they're like,
oh,

952
00:57:58.571 --> 00:58:00.550
we're just going to make a hundred thousand dollar machines for,

953
00:58:00.850 --> 00:58:05.110
for NASA and Jpl and,
and,
uh,
you know,

954
00:58:05.120 --> 00:58:09.030
car company is,
they all use those,
uh,
the really super expensive one.

955
00:58:09.031 --> 00:58:12.930
So unfortunately that's what kind of held this technology back.
I think.
Um,

956
00:58:12.970 --> 00:58:15.190
the great thing is that right when they expired,

957
00:58:15.580 --> 00:58:20.290
the Arduino was coming into light.
Um,
a bunch of software was coming.

958
00:58:20.310 --> 00:58:22.570
It was a lot easier because of the internet,
all this stuff.

959
00:58:22.571 --> 00:58:26.650
And that's what made this even feel the fire room or a with everybody making

960
00:58:26.651 --> 00:58:27.850
their own version of three d printers.

961
00:58:28.540 --> 00:58:32.540
<v 3>Yes
though.
What?</v>

962
00:58:35.440 --> 00:58:36.273
Oh sorry.

963
00:58:38.380 --> 00:58:41.380
<v 4>Uh,
in regards to the patent,
yes,
I heard a rumor.</v>

964
00:58:41.381 --> 00:58:46.150
The curable one is actually starting to go.
Right.
Be careful.

965
00:58:46.510 --> 00:58:50.380
<v 2>Actually that was a first pen.
So that I think already expired.</v>

966
00:58:51.410 --> 00:58:54.130
<v 4>Be a larger amount of smaller printers that can do that versus</v>

967
00:58:54.330 --> 00:58:56.340
<v 2>there's already a bunch.
Yeah,
there's a lot.</v>

968
00:58:56.380 --> 00:59:00.580
The Sky made this hundred dollars version called the peachy brighter.

969
00:59:01.110 --> 00:59:01.650
Um,

970
00:59:01.650 --> 00:59:06.270
I absolutely don't recommend it unless he was just want to play with something

971
00:59:06.271 --> 00:59:06.870
funny.

972
00:59:06.870 --> 00:59:11.700
But he actually made this three d printer that's literally $100 or less.

973
00:59:11.701 --> 00:59:13.050
Actually I should costs a lot less,

974
00:59:13.410 --> 00:59:18.180
but he made it so you run it off an audio jack from your computer.

975
00:59:18.840 --> 00:59:21.830
Uh,
I know it sounds weird,
but it's clever.
It's very clever.

976
00:59:22.310 --> 00:59:25.550
And you can actually three d prints on me,
but you can't bring anything serious.

977
00:59:25.551 --> 00:59:29.330
It was just so unaccurate I guess you might call it.

978
00:59:29.840 --> 00:59:31.760
But basically it works with the,

979
00:59:31.820 --> 00:59:36.140
with the mirror that with the audio.
Uh,

980
00:59:36.380 --> 00:59:39.440
I guess,
uh,
I forgot how he did,
but what the audio,

981
00:59:39.441 --> 00:59:42.950
he made the mere move in two dimensions.
Um,

982
00:59:43.010 --> 00:59:46.410
and you shoot a laser that and your cure the resin and you put the resin in

983
00:59:46.411 --> 00:59:51.080
water that salty and so as it cures and you drink more water,

984
00:59:51.081 --> 00:59:54.710
it moves the liquid back up.
And it was,
it was very clever.

985
00:59:55.040 --> 00:59:58.270
I got to give him that,
uh,
but not a recommended three d printer,

986
00:59:58.280 --> 01:00:02.930
but now they have,
they have like thousand,
$2,000 printers that are resin based.

987
01:00:03.290 --> 01:00:07.040
Um,
I have one that's about $3,400,

988
01:00:07.580 --> 01:00:12.500
3000 bucks machine and that works with a projector and it projects underneath

989
01:00:12.610 --> 01:00:17.180
where the resonance is and it pops it out of the liquid with a z access

990
01:00:17.181 --> 01:00:20.990
basically.
Um,
so yeah,
that,
I think that was one of the first,

991
01:00:20.991 --> 01:00:23.450
cause right after that one was patented,

992
01:00:23.451 --> 01:00:27.510
they patent like this one like right after,
like they're like,

993
01:00:28.040 --> 01:00:28.910
and then you had,

994
01:00:28.940 --> 01:00:31.820
that's where three d systems comes from and that's where Stratasys comes from.

995
01:00:32.420 --> 01:00:36.620
Three d systems had the SLA,

996
01:00:37.340 --> 01:00:42.230
which is the liquid resin,
three d printer or pattens and then Stratasys,

997
01:00:42.231 --> 01:00:44.750
how the FDM printers and they both kind of develop.

998
01:00:44.751 --> 01:00:47.780
And then they started gobbling up companies trying to come up with other
patents.

999
01:00:48.280 --> 01:00:50.120
Um,
and so they somehow,

1000
01:00:50.121 --> 01:00:54.860
the metal stuff somehow the powder ones and Ellie.
So,
but you know,

1001
01:00:54.861 --> 01:00:56.540
as soon as these patents start expiring,

1002
01:00:56.541 --> 01:00:59.000
like all of this competition starts coming up.

1003
01:00:59.390 --> 01:01:04.350
So you'll know when more patents expires.
Four sisters,
one patent that we,
uh,

1004
01:01:04.400 --> 01:01:09.260
one thing that we wanted to do a lot of people wanted to do is for abs printing.

1005
01:01:09.261 --> 01:01:13.730
We needed a heated chamber for a three d printer that had to be at like 80

1006
01:01:13.731 --> 01:01:17.960
degrees Celsius to print abs parts really well.

1007
01:01:18.350 --> 01:01:20.030
And they had a patent on it.
It's still,

1008
01:01:20.031 --> 01:01:22.370
I think it's still there or might have expired,

1009
01:01:22.820 --> 01:01:26.000
but nobody could make call their three d printer with a,

1010
01:01:26.001 --> 01:01:28.580
he need temperature control heating chamber or something.
It was like,

1011
01:01:28.581 --> 01:01:30.770
so like abstract,

1012
01:01:31.250 --> 01:01:34.160
like it was just like three d printer with heated chamber or something.

1013
01:01:34.730 --> 01:01:38.540
So it was like,
Eh,
how do you fight that?
Uh,
so yeah,

1014
01:01:38.541 --> 01:01:43.520
there's stuff like that happening.
So,
yeah.
So,
cool.
Any other questions?

1015
01:01:43.700 --> 01:01:48.220
I hope no.
Anything.
Um,

1016
01:01:48.320 --> 01:01:50.920
I didn't talk much about the firmware I guess,
but,
um,

1017
01:01:51.320 --> 01:01:55.460
the firmware is pretty simple if you,
if you mess with Arduinos.
Um,

1018
01:01:56.900 --> 01:01:58.970
okay,
go ahead.
No,
no,
go ahead.
Go ahead.

1019
01:02:01.310 --> 01:02:04.670
So the firmware,
the ones,
the machines I have are,

1020
01:02:04.700 --> 01:02:06.470
I made our Arduino based,

1021
01:02:06.890 --> 01:02:10.910
which means you could use the Arduino ide to just hook up to the chip and

1022
01:02:10.911 --> 01:02:14.750
reprogram it to do whatever you want.
There's no lock on it.
Um,

1023
01:02:14.960 --> 01:02:17.300
you can't really read the data off of it.

1024
01:02:17.301 --> 01:02:20.070
You could capture it as a hex phone and save it.

1025
01:02:20.250 --> 01:02:24.000
They can't really reverse engineer it very easily the way it is compiled,

1026
01:02:24.330 --> 01:02:27.430
which I'm sure if you guys work with software,
you know what that entails.
Um,

1027
01:02:27.900 --> 01:02:29.520
but it's all open source.
So yeah.

1028
01:02:29.670 --> 01:02:34.050
What we did is we grabbed the open source software and we tweak the settings and

1029
01:02:34.200 --> 01:02:36.840
turned on and off features that we didn't won and won.

1030
01:02:36.841 --> 01:02:40.530
And we actually fixed a bug in it.
Oh yeah.
We could talk about it back in there.

1031
01:02:40.920 --> 01:02:44.670
That's a very serious buyer.
You too.
But uh,
yeah,
so we did all that.

1032
01:02:44.700 --> 01:02:48.450
That's all open source.
It's all available online and it's,
and it's always,

1033
01:02:48.510 --> 01:02:49.321
you know,
open sores.

1034
01:02:49.321 --> 01:02:53.130
It's just constantly changing and improving and getting more features and

1035
01:02:53.131 --> 01:02:54.210
different stuff.

1036
01:02:54.211 --> 01:02:57.690
So like now you can grab that same freedom from where we use like three,

1037
01:02:57.700 --> 01:03:01.400
four years ago and the new version now,
how's like the core x,
y features,

1038
01:03:01.410 --> 01:03:02.640
a delta features,

1039
01:03:03.000 --> 01:03:05.460
all that stuff is in there and you just turn them on and off as you need them

1040
01:03:05.850 --> 01:03:09.750
and then just reprogram your trip.
It's pretty simple.
Yeah.

1041
01:03:10.300 --> 01:03:13.680
Good question.
So the future where,
where do you see this going?

1042
01:03:13.730 --> 01:03:16.550
It's been around for eight to 10 years and it's,
Huh?

1043
01:03:17.110 --> 01:03:20.350
Well three prayer has been around since the mid 80 [inaudible] so it's like 30

1044
01:03:20.351 --> 01:03:24.370
years.
Right.
And it was to make the case.
So that's something useful so to speak,

1045
01:03:25.060 --> 01:03:27.070
is that when I'm going to be able to,
I don't know,

1046
01:03:27.090 --> 01:03:28.350
print a chair or something like,

1047
01:03:28.680 --> 01:03:33.390
oh well technically you could print a chair now you can print anything now.

1048
01:03:33.390 --> 01:03:34.470
It's a matter of if you,

1049
01:03:35.130 --> 01:03:39.310
if you could afford it or if it's actually practical,
uh,

1050
01:03:39.390 --> 01:03:42.090
that's where things are getting better.
Obviously things are,
you know,

1051
01:03:42.091 --> 01:03:46.890
it's always getting smaller or bigger,
faster,
cheaper.
That's always happening.
Um,

1052
01:03:47.070 --> 01:03:49.410
we're at that really good curve right now though,

1053
01:03:49.411 --> 01:03:51.780
that so many people are getting into it.

1054
01:03:52.020 --> 01:03:54.630
All these new ideas and new approaches are happening,

1055
01:03:54.900 --> 01:03:58.740
new discoveries are made that are getting this technology really moving forward

1056
01:03:58.741 --> 01:04:00.090
fast.
Um,

1057
01:04:00.330 --> 01:04:04.230
I can't say we're going to have the star Trek replicators yet,

1058
01:04:04.590 --> 01:04:05.730
or you just go up to and go,
hey,

1059
01:04:05.731 --> 01:04:08.400
I want a cup of coffee and then mixed the cup and pours.
It wasn't,

1060
01:04:09.210 --> 01:04:11.400
that's not there yet,
but we're getting there.
Uh,

1061
01:04:11.540 --> 01:04:15.150
and I think everybody's aiming for that.
Um,
but,
uh,

1062
01:04:15.151 --> 01:04:19.470
the diversity of three d printers,
it's like crazily diverse.
Um,

1063
01:04:19.740 --> 01:04:23.310
we have microscopic three d printers that they three d print microscopic things

1064
01:04:23.311 --> 01:04:27.150
to put into your body to either detect things or fix things.

1065
01:04:27.540 --> 01:04:30.810
And then you have three d printers.
I build buildings.
Um,

1066
01:04:30.840 --> 01:04:35.400
it just three D it's like this three d brain,
but lays down summit.
Uh,

1067
01:04:35.550 --> 01:04:38.340
if you could imagine that there's some really cool stuff.
If you look it up,

1068
01:04:38.341 --> 01:04:40.770
you'll find cool youtube videos about that.

1069
01:04:40.771 --> 01:04:43.890
This guy made like this castle in his back yard of cement with a three d right

1070
01:04:43.891 --> 01:04:44.724
now.

1071
01:04:46.280 --> 01:04:47.113
<v 3>Huh.</v>

1072
01:04:50.410 --> 01:04:51.243
<v 2>Oh really?</v>

1073
01:04:51.370 --> 01:04:55.060
Well that's one of the first days we started talking about cause we'd have like

1074
01:04:55.330 --> 01:04:58.090
people interview some things and there's a while.

1075
01:04:58.091 --> 01:05:00.530
Where do you think three prairie going?
And um,

1076
01:05:00.700 --> 01:05:03.380
that's where close to JPL was very inspiring to,

1077
01:05:03.610 --> 01:05:07.930
to have space programs next to us because we're in Pasadena.
But uh,
yeah,

1078
01:05:07.931 --> 01:05:09.040
we would say,
hey,
you know,

1079
01:05:09.041 --> 01:05:13.270
the ultimate three d printer would be to send one to Mars,

1080
01:05:13.300 --> 01:05:16.750
use its local resources and start building our house in foreigners.

1081
01:05:17.200 --> 01:05:21.070
Cause I already have my house designed for it.
But uh,

1082
01:05:21.100 --> 01:05:23.940
but I mean that's like the super ultimate type of three d printing,

1083
01:05:23.950 --> 01:05:28.180
which would be awesome.
The other thing is I think,
uh,

1084
01:05:28.360 --> 01:05:29.740
I mean I would like,

1085
01:05:29.741 --> 01:05:33.700
and I'm assuming three parents going to be like next to your microwave at some

1086
01:05:33.701 --> 01:05:37.430
point where,
hey,
I need this part because this thing broke off.
Dirtier,
dirtier.

1087
01:05:38.100 --> 01:05:42.830
It comes out,
you know,
it's going to be that easy.
And that,
uh,
you know,

1088
01:05:42.850 --> 01:05:45.400
that's simple and that diverse,
um,

1089
01:05:45.940 --> 01:05:49.060
the material science behind three d printing is like the,

1090
01:05:49.061 --> 01:05:54.061
probably the hardest part of it is how do you get certain materials to function

1091
01:05:54.431 --> 01:05:58.840
like you know,
production type of materials.
Um,
and you know,

1092
01:05:58.841 --> 01:06:02.320
if you make metal parts,
it should,
everybody expects it to be a part.

1093
01:06:02.321 --> 01:06:05.860
Like you machined it.
It's super strong super thing.
Um,

1094
01:06:05.980 --> 01:06:09.160
but there's also things you do that are discovered new with three d printing

1095
01:06:09.161 --> 01:06:12.220
that you couldn't do before,
especially in the space program.

1096
01:06:12.790 --> 01:06:17.790
I mean there's complex parts that are so light and so strong that has never been

1097
01:06:19.211 --> 01:06:23.140
accomplished before because of the algorithms you could use to figure out

1098
01:06:23.141 --> 01:06:25.950
exactly where to put supports in strengths and,

1099
01:06:26.330 --> 01:06:29.140
and holes and stuff to save material and all that.
Right.

1100
01:06:29.170 --> 01:06:32.200
Space X is three d printing rocket parts.
Yeah,
absolutely.

1101
01:06:33.040 --> 01:06:35.740
But it's not that they're not three printing because they can,

1102
01:06:35.800 --> 01:06:38.980
it's their three print cause they could add certain features to that that was

1103
01:06:38.981 --> 01:06:41.000
never done before.
Um,

1104
01:06:41.170 --> 01:06:45.250
I mean if you imagine things that have valves and channels and stuff,
um,

1105
01:06:45.490 --> 01:06:50.490
you could do that now without all in one solid part that before I'd have to be a

1106
01:06:51.971 --> 01:06:55.210
bunch of parts.
That means you have to add bolts and then you had unreliability.

1107
01:06:55.211 --> 01:06:59.170
Cause there's a big split there.
There's things connecting and stuff like that.

1108
01:06:59.171 --> 01:07:02.800
So now it's just like one part and it's like,
you know,

1109
01:07:03.100 --> 01:07:04.900
a third of the weight and twice as strong.

1110
01:07:05.860 --> 01:07:08.740
So there's a lot of stuff like that and they're developing more and more of that

1111
01:07:08.741 --> 01:07:12.950
too.
There's a,
one of the ultimate things I don't,

1112
01:07:13.210 --> 01:07:16.650
this sounds very impossible to accomplish,
but they might accomplish it.
Um,

1113
01:07:16.780 --> 01:07:19.390
you guys know the hyperloop,
you guys were,
you know,

1114
01:07:19.391 --> 01:07:23.230
it is right that train with the two.
So I have this friend that's,
uh,

1115
01:07:23.290 --> 01:07:24.260
he goes to crash base.

1116
01:07:24.261 --> 01:07:27.820
He used to work at space x and he's like a expert robotics,

1117
01:07:28.210 --> 01:07:32.170
robotic engineering stuff.
And,
uh,
last time I saw him,
he's like,
yeah,

1118
01:07:32.171 --> 01:07:34.710
I'm working on hyperloop and the higher,
and they're like,

1119
01:07:34.830 --> 01:07:38.110
do you want me to make this big machine that basically three d prints the tube

1120
01:07:38.111 --> 01:07:42.100
in place?
And I'm like,
what?
That's like mind blowing.
I mean,

1121
01:07:42.101 --> 01:07:45.730
imagine the materials,
like the cabling,
everything.
He's like,
yeah,
they just,

1122
01:07:46.090 --> 01:07:48.770
they needed to,
it has to,
uh,

1123
01:07:49.480 --> 01:07:52.360
build a tunnel and three d printed as it goes.

1124
01:07:52.900 --> 01:07:56.470
It's like there's stuff like that being developed.
So that's pretty intense.

1125
01:07:56.980 --> 01:08:00.160
It's pretty serious stuff and it all needs good software.

1126
