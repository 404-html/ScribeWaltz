1
00:00:06.160 --> 00:00:07.870
Hello,
pleasure to be here.
Uh,

2
00:00:07.871 --> 00:00:12.871
so I run this a submarine in Honduras right in the middle of Central America off

3
00:00:13.781 --> 00:00:18.700
a island called row a Tan.
And I've been there since 1998.

4
00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:20.830
And the submarine,
I'm operating,

5
00:00:20.831 --> 00:00:25.831
I built myself and it's the second one and I'm here today to share,

6
00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:29.500
uh,
mostly underwater pictures,
images,

7
00:00:29.501 --> 00:00:31.690
give you an idea of things that live down there.

8
00:00:31.870 --> 00:00:36.820
And also just a little bit of a background on how adult the submarines and a

9
00:00:36.821 --> 00:00:39.880
little bit on where,
uh,

10
00:00:39.881 --> 00:00:42.430
the submersible industry is as a whole.

11
00:00:43.810 --> 00:00:48.220
So something that to put in context,

12
00:00:48.460 --> 00:00:53.460
is there very few places in the world where people actually have the ability to

13
00:00:54.521 --> 00:00:58.000
see with their own eyes,
uh,
what's going on in,
in the deep ocean?

14
00:00:58.810 --> 00:01:03.810
The majority of vehicles that are doing this are run mostly by first world

15
00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:09.760
governments actually.
So there's been,
in the 20 years,

16
00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:15.420
I would say there's been a abrupt change between 20 years ago.

17
00:01:15.550 --> 00:01:20.470
The majority of the vehicles that we're going say 2000 feet under the ocean,

18
00:01:20.650 --> 00:01:25.070
we're run by a handful of first world governments.
Uh,

19
00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:30.720
today the majority of vehicles that are capable of going 2000,

20
00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:35.980
3000 feet deep are actually run by private individuals.
It's,
uh,

21
00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:38.520
it's been the,

22
00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:44.410
the submersible industry is kind of a microcosm of what's going on with funding

23
00:01:44.411 --> 00:01:46.360
for science overall in the world.
I,

24
00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:51.450
I believe so with the exception of China and India,

25
00:01:52.150 --> 00:01:55.270
China and now operates the deepest submersible.

26
00:01:55.930 --> 00:01:59.560
It's only been built and tested maybe three years ago,

27
00:01:59.950 --> 00:02:04.950
but they're going seven or seven and a half thousand meters and India is working

28
00:02:05.351 --> 00:02:08.110
on one that's going to be the second deepest one in the world.

29
00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:10.690
To put it in context,
20 years ago,

30
00:02:10.691 --> 00:02:15.300
the United States on a government level was operating five deep sea

31
00:02:15.301 --> 00:02:16.121
submersibles.

32
00:02:16.121 --> 00:02:21.121
And now there's only one left that used to do a hundred to 200 days of diving a

33
00:02:21.311 --> 00:02:25.930
year.
Last year they only did 60.
So on the flip side,

34
00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:31.350
they're machines like this one that there's five companies now,

35
00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:34.870
uh,
one out of Florida,
California,

36
00:02:34.871 --> 00:02:39.871
Europe that are offering basically toys for people to have on their mega yachts.

37
00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:45.110
This is another one.
Uh,
this company has made over a dozen there.

38
00:02:45.111 --> 00:02:47.980
They actually have a small assembly line going.

39
00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:52.480
So if you're in that market,
it's a booming time.

40
00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:53.790
This is a,

41
00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:58.800
a boat that's operated by a foundation started by Ray Dalio of hedge fund theme.

42
00:03:02.410 --> 00:03:06.880
And also if any of you have seen the new blue planet theories,

43
00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:08.380
this a boat,

44
00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:13.440
they have two subs on board and they're really in terms of images that are out

45
00:03:14.741 --> 00:03:18.310
there that people are seeing now of the deep sea from a a man sub.

46
00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:21.280
This is kind of the flagship in the world,

47
00:03:21.460 --> 00:03:26.460
but it's basically privately funded with personal money.

48
00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:31.310
So in the middle of this,
uh,

49
00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:35.310
my little niche that I've carved out a,

50
00:03:35.320 --> 00:03:39.430
it started with a dream when I was nine years old and I started building my

51
00:03:39.431 --> 00:03:41.320
first sub when I was 15.

52
00:03:42.490 --> 00:03:46.800
And then offering trips to the public really just became a,

53
00:03:46.970 --> 00:03:51.580
it evolved into that in terms of having a way to keep,
uh,

54
00:03:51.610 --> 00:03:54.160
keep the things sustainable financially.

55
00:03:54.520 --> 00:03:59.520
But now it has become the world's premiere location for the public to have cost

56
00:04:00.950 --> 00:04:05.770
effective,
direct access to the deep water.
It's the deepest one in the world.

57
00:04:05.771 --> 00:04:08.980
The public has the ability to book a ticket on.

58
00:04:09.490 --> 00:04:11.560
I'm taking people to 2000 feet.

59
00:04:13.600 --> 00:04:15.970
So this is a,
I grew up in New Jersey,

60
00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:18.880
just a 40 minutes or so from here.

61
00:04:19.210 --> 00:04:24.070
This was in 19 eight 88.
I'm 15 years old there.
There's my dad looking on,

62
00:04:24.580 --> 00:04:29.580
he joked that it was the pipe in the yard and it was for a number of years until

63
00:04:30.491 --> 00:04:34.570
I brought it down to college in Florida and finished it up there.

64
00:04:35.500 --> 00:04:39.460
And this a carried myself and one passenger.

65
00:04:40.690 --> 00:04:44.920
It was extremely small,
uh,
in terms of this displacement,

66
00:04:45.820 --> 00:04:50.200
uh,
that tells exactly where the submarine,
how big,

67
00:04:50.260 --> 00:04:54.640
how big it is,
because it has to be able to achieve neutral buoyancy.

68
00:04:54.641 --> 00:04:58.420
So basically an aquarium of that same volume,

69
00:04:58.840 --> 00:05:03.730
2100 pounds,
uh,
there's some one person vehicles that way that,

70
00:05:03.731 --> 00:05:06.820
so it's,
it was very small.
Not everybody could fit,

71
00:05:06.880 --> 00:05:11.880
but it was successful largely because of its small size because it was very cost

72
00:05:13.601 --> 00:05:14.740
effective to operate.

73
00:05:15.010 --> 00:05:20.010
And I ran that for well solidly for two years taking passengers and a Max of 700

74
00:05:24.191 --> 00:05:25.024
feet.

75
00:05:26.290 --> 00:05:30.520
So I left to go do a salvage contracting Cuba.

76
00:05:30.610 --> 00:05:33.310
And then when I got dropped back off in Florida,

77
00:05:33.610 --> 00:05:38.610
I realized this was becoming my career and I was going to need a bigger boat.

78
00:05:39.191 --> 00:05:43.720
So I started designing around to uh,

79
00:05:43.960 --> 00:05:48.960
upcycled parts that I was able to obtain the forward sphere and the large dome

80
00:05:50.081 --> 00:05:54.370
window,
both of which would have been out of my budget,
uh,

81
00:05:55.360 --> 00:05:57.590
by themselves if I had to him new.

82
00:05:58.040 --> 00:06:01.240
But I designed around those,
uh,

83
00:06:01.280 --> 00:06:06.280
this is the only sub ever made of three spheres of three different sizes or

84
00:06:07.460 --> 00:06:10.640
three spheres joined in an l configuration like this.

85
00:06:11.180 --> 00:06:14.810
And the passenger sits side by side up front.

86
00:06:15.140 --> 00:06:16.940
And I'm standing up in the back driving.

87
00:06:17.420 --> 00:06:22.420
And this is actually a really good arrangement because I have the ability to

88
00:06:23.060 --> 00:06:27.830
look complete.
I have awareness of everything around us,
including looking up,

89
00:06:28.040 --> 00:06:30.290
but the passengers,
uh,

90
00:06:30.650 --> 00:06:35.000
get closer to animal life.
You're going to see some of the photos later.

91
00:06:35.001 --> 00:06:39.710
They're all taken through the dome window that the passengers are looking

92
00:06:39.711 --> 00:06:40.544
through.

93
00:06:40.610 --> 00:06:45.610
But we also have an overlapping field division where I'm able to see the animal

94
00:06:46.371 --> 00:06:51.371
that we want to observe in relation to the window so I can get the passengers

95
00:06:51.650 --> 00:06:55.400
extremely close.
So,

96
00:06:56.930 --> 00:06:58.940
uh,
this was my scale model.

97
00:06:59.210 --> 00:07:04.210
I originally designed it without the aid of computer design or it was a little

98
00:07:04.581 --> 00:07:07.850
bit of trial and error and a little bit of educated guessing,

99
00:07:07.851 --> 00:07:10.850
but done on a very basic level.

100
00:07:11.810 --> 00:07:14.300
I did all my own welding,
a lot of my own machining.

101
00:07:14.301 --> 00:07:18.920
I built it in a town called Oklahoma,
a town called Idabel,
Oklahoma,

102
00:07:19.010 --> 00:07:21.020
the vehicles and named after the town.

103
00:07:21.021 --> 00:07:26.021
The people there were incredibly supportive and it's a small town in a very

104
00:07:27.710 --> 00:07:29.180
rural area of Oklahoma.

105
00:07:29.330 --> 00:07:34.330
So it was kind of famous there for a bit and it worked out great too.

106
00:07:34.341 --> 00:07:38.840
There was a 200 foot deep lake that a,
I was able to test it in.

107
00:07:40.070 --> 00:07:45.070
Here's the components being heat treated in a facility in Louisiana.

108
00:07:46.280 --> 00:07:50.360
So after you do welding on something,
a picture,

109
00:07:50.361 --> 00:07:53.630
like if you put dried glue on a balloon and it,

110
00:07:53.690 --> 00:07:57.270
the weld will as it's heating and contracting,
uh,

111
00:07:57.350 --> 00:08:01.010
induce this stressing induces stresses into the metal.

112
00:08:01.250 --> 00:08:05.060
So if you want it to be extra strong after you're done with all your welding,

113
00:08:05.360 --> 00:08:09.980
you bake it in an oven at a certain temperature and that allows the tension from

114
00:08:09.981 --> 00:08:12.890
the welding to relax.
That's what's going on here.

115
00:08:14.390 --> 00:08:17.510
And there's the finished,
uh,

116
00:08:17.540 --> 00:08:19.520
pressure hall in primer

117
00:08:21.830 --> 00:08:22.663
and paint.

118
00:08:23.330 --> 00:08:27.020
So the new vehicle that carries to myself in two passengers,

119
00:08:27.590 --> 00:08:30.260
though ultimately that's decided by weight,

120
00:08:30.410 --> 00:08:34.640
you have about 460 pounds for the passengers.

121
00:08:34.641 --> 00:08:35.630
The record is six.

122
00:08:35.631 --> 00:08:39.710
That was a family with a bunch of small children and uh,

123
00:08:39.860 --> 00:08:44.860
it's made over 1,500 dives as deep as half a mile and is right around 9,000

124
00:08:48.651 --> 00:08:53.510
pounds.
So a little more elbow room in there.
Then the first,
first version,

125
00:08:55.260 --> 00:08:56.370
there it is underwater.

126
00:09:03.810 --> 00:09:04.643
<v 1>Okay.</v>

127
00:09:06.230 --> 00:09:09.170
<v 0>So does anybody know what these animals are?</v>

128
00:09:11.560 --> 00:09:16.240
Uh,
yeah.
Uh,
most of the people that,

129
00:09:16.360 --> 00:09:19.120
so I see these on every dive there.

130
00:09:19.121 --> 00:09:21.610
One of the oldest forms of life on the planet,

131
00:09:21.640 --> 00:09:24.700
they're in the fossil record 500 million years,

132
00:09:25.090 --> 00:09:27.190
which is 10 times,

133
00:09:27.220 --> 00:09:32.220
almost 10 times as long as the dinosaurs were around and they've been unchanged.

134
00:09:33.340 --> 00:09:37.900
Most of the people that,
uh,
I've had as passengers that know what they are,

135
00:09:37.901 --> 00:09:40.600
it's because they are into studying fossils.

136
00:09:41.800 --> 00:09:42.250
<v 1>Okay.</v>

137
00:09:42.250 --> 00:09:44.890
<v 0>And basically they're going to survive.</v>

138
00:09:44.920 --> 00:09:49.920
They only live a 500 feet or deeper and their relatives of starfish and they can

139
00:09:50.351 --> 00:09:51.184
walk around

140
00:09:53.030 --> 00:09:58.020
and there's a whole bunch of them on a limestone arch.

141
00:09:58.200 --> 00:09:59.670
That's it.
1200 feet.

142
00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:01.560
<v 1>Okay.</v>

143
00:10:01.560 --> 00:10:06.560
<v 0>And this is a closeup of the terrain between 300 to 600 feet where I'm diving.</v>

144
00:10:11.191 --> 00:10:13.200
It's a vertical trench wall.

145
00:10:13.530 --> 00:10:18.530
I'm on the edge of the Cayman Trench and there basically a band of rock around

146
00:10:19.681 --> 00:10:24.681
most places in the world that looks very much like this photo here that is a

147
00:10:25.471 --> 00:10:30.471
drowned ancient reef from when sea level was 450 feet lower than it is now.

148
00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:37.230
So
when the sea level was that much lower,

149
00:10:37.231 --> 00:10:39.570
the shallow water reef was growing there,

150
00:10:39.720 --> 00:10:44.490
which puts a layer of limestone on things,
which is what this is.

151
00:10:44.700 --> 00:10:47.340
And uh,
but then when sea level rises,

152
00:10:48.150 --> 00:10:53.150
the coral reef dies and then the rock that it created slowly dissolves and make

153
00:10:54.271 --> 00:10:55.740
something that looks like this.

154
00:10:56.550 --> 00:11:00.630
So actually a lot of the shallow water reefs around the world,

155
00:11:01.740 --> 00:11:06.390
if things continue at the pace they're going may one day look sort of like this.

156
00:11:08.100 --> 00:11:08.280
<v 1>Okay.</v>

157
00:11:08.280 --> 00:11:11.460
<v 0>To give you a sense of scale,
the corals on here,</v>

158
00:11:11.461 --> 00:11:14.520
the white ones are one to two feet across.

159
00:11:14.880 --> 00:11:18.960
Something else that's very surprising to people when they take trips with me is

160
00:11:18.961 --> 00:11:20.280
the clarity of the water.

161
00:11:20.310 --> 00:11:24.300
People think that it's going to be very dark down there.
But,
uh,

162
00:11:24.301 --> 00:11:27.360
actually what happens is it about 300 feet,

163
00:11:27.400 --> 00:11:32.400
there's a major thermocline and the visibility of the water skyrockets to the

164
00:11:32.581 --> 00:11:35.190
point where you can see 300 easily.

165
00:11:35.191 --> 00:11:37.860
You could see across this whole room with natural light,

166
00:11:37.980 --> 00:11:39.330
a thousand feet underwater.

167
00:11:39.810 --> 00:11:43.470
And I've seen the surface from 600 feet.

168
00:11:45.410 --> 00:11:48.380
So these are six skill sharks.

169
00:11:50.520 --> 00:11:52.250
I've,
uh,

170
00:11:52.740 --> 00:11:57.740
done close to a hundred dives with date where we go at night and have the bait.

171
00:11:58.990 --> 00:12:03.310
We used to stick it out at the end of a pole,
but we've,
uh,

172
00:12:04.810 --> 00:12:09.760
I've developed enough of a,
the sharks,
their metabolism is very low.

173
00:12:09.761 --> 00:12:14.170
The water down there is below 50 degrees,
so they,

174
00:12:14.410 --> 00:12:17.320
they're not super aggressive.
They're big.
Uh,

175
00:12:17.321 --> 00:12:21.790
to give you a sense of scale in this photo,
that window is 30 inches across.

176
00:12:21.791 --> 00:12:25.330
So these sharks,
they get 16,
18 feet long.

177
00:12:26.590 --> 00:12:31.590
And I've had a theory for years that nobody that I've spoken to is even been

178
00:12:34.451 --> 00:12:35.950
able to offer an alternative.

179
00:12:36.310 --> 00:12:41.310
But these are most likely the most numerous animal over say 200 pounds left on

180
00:12:46.301 --> 00:12:50.020
the planet today outside of humans and their livestock,

181
00:12:50.500 --> 00:12:53.770
their found,
uh,
pretty much worldwide.

182
00:12:54.700 --> 00:12:57.430
But in tropical waters,
they prefer,

183
00:12:58.480 --> 00:13:01.390
prefer to be three to 5,000 feet during the day.

184
00:13:01.570 --> 00:13:05.710
So they have basically been left alone.

185
00:13:05.830 --> 00:13:07.900
They're too big for people to,

186
00:13:08.360 --> 00:13:13.210
it's not worth the hassle yet for people to fish them that deep and pull

187
00:13:13.211 --> 00:13:17.020
something up that big from that,
you know,
that heavy from that deep.

188
00:13:18.540 --> 00:13:21.940
Uh,
this,
uh,
Jeremy Wade,
uh,

189
00:13:21.941 --> 00:13:25.090
about a year ago we shot an episode of river monsters.

190
00:13:25.600 --> 00:13:28.150
We had an 80 pound pig on the bumper there.

191
00:13:28.630 --> 00:13:32.590
We did a series of dives to a film,
the six skills.

192
00:13:33.100 --> 00:13:36.160
And again,
to give you a context of scale,

193
00:13:36.580 --> 00:13:41.580
we had a Gopro in a custom housing on the end of a carbon fiber pole,

194
00:13:42.890 --> 00:13:43.210
uh,

195
00:13:43.210 --> 00:13:48.210
that got the shot and you can see the sub relative to the size of the vehicle.

196
00:13:49.360 --> 00:13:51.460
And can we play that video now please?

197
00:15:26.860 --> 00:15:31.780
That,
uh,
sound in there,
the scratching noise was actually their skin against,
uh,

198
00:15:31.810 --> 00:15:36.810
part of the sudden they have a surprisingly tough skin of attempted tagging them

199
00:15:37.900 --> 00:15:40.570
and they're,
they're very tough.

200
00:15:43.010 --> 00:15:47.560
Uh,
this was a dive I did with National Geographic.
This was a,

201
00:15:48.520 --> 00:15:52.990
we were lucky enough to come across a horse that,
uh,
met an unfortunate end.

202
00:15:52.991 --> 00:15:56.380
We had five sharks in a feeding frenzy.
But,
uh,
again,

203
00:15:57.010 --> 00:15:59.890
you can tell the size scale in that photo

204
00:16:01.580 --> 00:16:04.100
that was,
uh,
the shark was large enough.

205
00:16:04.101 --> 00:16:09.101
It was able to swallow the entire horse leg in one bite and they're deer on the

206
00:16:09.951 --> 00:16:13.850
island.
My neighbor,
uh,
keeps a few as pets.

207
00:16:13.851 --> 00:16:18.851
One died of old age and I did a shark dive and that was this photo.

208
00:16:20.800 --> 00:16:23.810
The shark was able to eat the whole deer one,
one gulp.

209
00:16:25.640 --> 00:16:29.090
So this is another kind of shark that,
uh,

210
00:16:30.470 --> 00:16:35.210
I might actually have more direct observations of then any,

211
00:16:36.080 --> 00:16:40.460
anybody ever.
They don't,
they're only about two and a half,
three feet long.

212
00:16:40.520 --> 00:16:44.780
And they live starting at around a thousand feet and they have these two big

213
00:16:44.781 --> 00:16:45.830
dorsal fins.

214
00:16:45.860 --> 00:16:50.860
The forward one has a poisonous spiking in it and they have a mouth,

215
00:16:50.961 --> 00:16:55.880
kind of like an eagle gray where they dig in the sand for things that are buried

216
00:16:55.881 --> 00:16:56.714
in there and they

217
00:16:57.700 --> 00:16:58.450
<v 1>okay,</v>

218
00:16:58.450 --> 00:17:03.190
<v 0>uh,
crunch them up that say a lucky shot.</v>

219
00:17:03.191 --> 00:17:08.191
Sometimes I do a dive with a Gopro on one second timelapse on the front bumper

220
00:17:08.650 --> 00:17:11.440
and just by chance got that shot.

221
00:17:13.180 --> 00:17:18.180
So in that photo you can see the underside of the shark has those ribs.

222
00:17:20.080 --> 00:17:20.913
Uh,

223
00:17:21.910 --> 00:17:26.910
much like a hammerheads head has the electro magnetic sensing that it can detect

224
00:17:29.320 --> 00:17:31.570
like say a ray buried in the sand.

225
00:17:31.960 --> 00:17:36.250
This shark instead of just its head being like that,

226
00:17:36.550 --> 00:17:38.860
the entire underside of its body is like that.

227
00:17:39.190 --> 00:17:44.190
So in this low light environment it's able to send small things buried in the

228
00:17:44.951 --> 00:17:45.784
sand.

229
00:17:47.590 --> 00:17:51.330
And this I believe is the only photo of a baby rough shark.

230
00:17:51.690 --> 00:17:55.140
I've only seen two and this is the better photo.

231
00:17:58.010 --> 00:18:01.250
This is a dumbo octopus.
They swim it their ears.

232
00:18:01.280 --> 00:18:03.620
They only started around 1800 feet.

233
00:18:03.920 --> 00:18:08.150
1800 feet is a significant depth.
That's where it's really getting

234
00:18:10.210 --> 00:18:11.720
down to total blackness,

235
00:18:12.020 --> 00:18:17.020
which is not only the majority of this planet is covered by water.

236
00:18:17.871 --> 00:18:20.540
So deep it's never seen sunlight.

237
00:18:20.630 --> 00:18:25.630
But also by volume you're talking something like a 700 to one ratio.

238
00:18:26.360 --> 00:18:28.610
Volume wise,
the,

239
00:18:28.660 --> 00:18:33.660
the living space of this planet is really cold,

240
00:18:34.790 --> 00:18:38.000
dark water.
So a lot of animals,

241
00:18:38.030 --> 00:18:42.470
that's specifically what they're evolved for and this is one of those animals.

242
00:18:45.660 --> 00:18:48.300
This is a deep,
deep water coral.

243
00:18:48.360 --> 00:18:53.310
The red thing on there is a starfish and that's about two feet in diameter.

244
00:18:55.330 --> 00:18:58.420
Very little is known about deep water coral.
Uh,

245
00:18:58.421 --> 00:19:00.280
we're just starting to study it now.

246
00:19:00.281 --> 00:19:05.281
A few countries are putting some resources to figuring out what,

247
00:19:05.381 --> 00:19:07.420
what they have in their territorial waters,

248
00:19:07.930 --> 00:19:12.930
but what they've learned so far is that there may actually be more area of deep

249
00:19:13.871 --> 00:19:16.300
water coral,
then shallow water coral,

250
00:19:16.750 --> 00:19:21.750
despite the fact that a majority of it might about already been destroyed by

251
00:19:22.421 --> 00:19:23.254
trawling.

252
00:19:23.530 --> 00:19:28.530
But there's certain areas where the habitat is so jagged where people avoid

253
00:19:29.081 --> 00:19:32.290
trawling that is relatively untouched.

254
00:19:32.410 --> 00:19:37.210
And in those areas,
uh,
you know,
it's this complete,

255
00:19:37.300 --> 00:19:42.300
completely separate deep water environment that rivals a shallow water reef.

256
00:19:42.640 --> 00:19:47.140
But usually these start at around 600 feet.

257
00:19:47.200 --> 00:19:49.540
It's kind of a shallow one.
The ones by me,

258
00:19:49.541 --> 00:19:51.700
they really start more around 1200 feet.

259
00:19:51.730 --> 00:19:56.730
So there's that barrier to entry that has kept them from being a better studied,

260
00:19:57.971 --> 00:19:58.804
are well known.

261
00:20:00.480 --> 00:20:03.540
This is a type of sea cucumber that can swim.

262
00:20:04.850 --> 00:20:05.210
<v 1>Yeah,</v>

263
00:20:05.210 --> 00:20:09.050
<v 0>this is a Kymera that's half shark half ray.
They have no cartilage.</v>

264
00:20:09.290 --> 00:20:11.990
That's the animal.
My logo is based off of,

265
00:20:13.700 --> 00:20:18.700
this is a predatory jellyfish called a siphon of four and they have stinging

266
00:20:19.160 --> 00:20:21.110
tentacles.
They can catch small fish.

267
00:20:21.620 --> 00:20:26.060
A certain types of SciFinder force can be a hundred feet long.

268
00:20:28.350 --> 00:20:31.410
That's a jelly,
no zeal.
They get to about five feet long.

269
00:20:33.040 --> 00:20:38.040
So this is a aerial view of the island where I live and you can see that

270
00:20:42.280 --> 00:20:47.230
there is not a,
so where that boat is on the left,

271
00:20:47.620 --> 00:20:50.920
that's already four or 500 feet deep right there.

272
00:20:51.310 --> 00:20:56.310
Basically the island is surrounded by incredibly deep water and actually part of

273
00:20:56.711 --> 00:20:58.630
the reason I'm here is uh,

274
00:20:59.080 --> 00:21:03.640
is like a little bit of thank you to the Schmidt Ocean Institute,

275
00:21:03.730 --> 00:21:08.170
which uh,
with this boat,
the Falcor that they run.

276
00:21:09.630 --> 00:21:10.170
<v 1>Uh,</v>

277
00:21:10.170 --> 00:21:15.170
<v 0>they had been doing a project in the Cayman Islands and then we're relocating</v>

278
00:21:15.601 --> 00:21:16.920
through the canal.

279
00:21:17.100 --> 00:21:22.100
And a scientists that had worked with them had worked with me and realized that

280
00:21:24.061 --> 00:21:27.630
there was a unique opportunity here to do some multibeam sonar work,

281
00:21:27.660 --> 00:21:32.400
which is usually it would be the very first thing that would be done before

282
00:21:32.401 --> 00:21:36.090
putting any assets like a submersible or an Rov in the water.

283
00:21:36.750 --> 00:21:41.610
In this case,
uh,
I had been operating for more than 10 years.
When was,

284
00:21:41.730 --> 00:21:45.300
I was able to finally have a map.
So this is the map that

285
00:21:46.390 --> 00:21:50.440
the Falcor generated while they generated rod date data.

286
00:21:50.441 --> 00:21:55.360
And then they gave that data to an Undergrad student of this,
uh,

287
00:21:55.420 --> 00:21:56.171
scientist.

288
00:21:56.171 --> 00:22:01.171
And then a couple of months later they made this map but basically shows a major

289
00:22:03.731 --> 00:22:04.690
erosion channels,

290
00:22:04.691 --> 00:22:09.691
features after basically after more than a decade of driving around down there,

291
00:22:10.541 --> 00:22:13.150
basically the blind man looking at an elephant,

292
00:22:13.180 --> 00:22:17.500
I was able to see a photo of the entire elephant for the first time.

293
00:22:17.501 --> 00:22:20.470
So it was amazing that worked out like that.

294
00:22:20.740 --> 00:22:25.090
And to give you an idea of what kind of detail a map like that can do.

295
00:22:25.600 --> 00:22:28.720
Those lines are a hundred,

296
00:22:28.720 --> 00:22:32.980
a hundred foot increments and the dark spots or boulders.

297
00:22:33.490 --> 00:22:36.070
So thanks to this map,
I can actually

298
00:22:37.710 --> 00:22:42.710
have a map in my lap when I'm driving around down there and know exactly where I

299
00:22:44.941 --> 00:22:46.830
am relative to other features.

300
00:22:47.130 --> 00:22:52.130
And also it enables me to find better areas that are conducive to things like

301
00:22:53.971 --> 00:22:57.240
deep water coral.
In this example a,

302
00:22:57.241 --> 00:23:02.241
those red circles are boulders that are 50 to 100 feet high and they're all

303
00:23:03.391 --> 00:23:05.460
completely covered with deep water coral.

304
00:23:07.470 --> 00:23:08.030
<v 1>Okay.</v>

305
00:23:08.030 --> 00:23:11.060
<v 0>Which sets off a whole community of life.</v>

306
00:23:11.061 --> 00:23:15.060
I mean there's where there's rocks covered with coral,
you have more fit,

307
00:23:15.130 --> 00:23:17.560
more everything like very unique habitats.

308
00:23:17.561 --> 00:23:22.561
So actually the biggest obstacle to a more life being down there is

309
00:23:24.170 --> 00:23:25.280
sedimentation.

310
00:23:25.990 --> 00:23:26.823
<v 1>Uh,</v>

311
00:23:28.900 --> 00:23:33.900
<v 0>so on the top of there you can see it looks like big lines coming off.</v>

312
00:23:35.850 --> 00:23:39.480
Those are erosion channels that are up to 600 feet deep.

313
00:23:40.500 --> 00:23:40.930
<v 1>Okay.</v>

314
00:23:40.930 --> 00:23:44.230
<v 0>Everything being so steep,
erosion is a major factor.</v>

315
00:23:44.231 --> 00:23:49.231
Sometimes even see what looks like a waterfalls of sand coming down vertical

316
00:23:50.091 --> 00:23:54.410
areas.
So that hinders life.

317
00:23:54.411 --> 00:23:58.850
Being able to,
to take,
uh,
take a foothold picture,
you know,

318
00:23:58.851 --> 00:24:02.930
a plant trying to grow on the screen side of a mountain where there's a glacier

319
00:24:02.931 --> 00:24:06.800
moving.
That's a similar situation to what's going on here.

320
00:24:07.010 --> 00:24:12.010
Actually write down two blocks of rock peeling off the wall and much like a

321
00:24:12.530 --> 00:24:13.460
glacier calving,

322
00:24:13.820 --> 00:24:18.820
there's limestone blocks even at 2000 feet bigger than this room that the very

323
00:24:20.061 --> 00:24:23.340
fact that it's limestone shows that it was made by coral.

324
00:24:23.341 --> 00:24:28.341
So it the deepest that it fell from with 700 feet and it broke free and rolled

325
00:24:30.261 --> 00:24:33.750
down there.
So animals,
uh,

326
00:24:33.800 --> 00:24:37.070
when they can find boulders like that to get on top of,

327
00:24:37.310 --> 00:24:42.290
now they're out of that flow of sediment and that's where they have their best

328
00:24:42.291 --> 00:24:46.820
chance of surviving.
And if you get a bunch of boulders like that in one area,

329
00:24:46.850 --> 00:24:51.290
now you have critical mass for a whole community to really flourish.

330
00:24:51.650 --> 00:24:56.360
So those are the kinds of things that I'm looking for with this map that the

331
00:24:56.361 --> 00:25:00.770
Falcor generated.
And so because of that map,

332
00:25:01.370 --> 00:25:04.130
uh,
I've now made this device,

333
00:25:04.131 --> 00:25:08.900
which I call the sub sled and the submarine docs in there.

334
00:25:08.901 --> 00:25:13.700
This,
this,
uh,
floating sled.

335
00:25:13.940 --> 00:25:18.940
It's made out of fiberglass and PVC fiberglass reinforced board and it has three

336
00:25:22.491 --> 00:25:27.491
ballast compartments and basically you can put it in the water,

337
00:25:27.800 --> 00:25:31.820
flood the tank so it sits real low,
drive the submarine in it,

338
00:25:31.850 --> 00:25:36.850
then partially inflate the ballast compartments and you can tow from the

339
00:25:37.971 --> 00:25:40.670
submarine itself.
The water pressure keeps the,

340
00:25:40.870 --> 00:25:44.510
the sled pushed on the front of it.
Uh,
they're,

341
00:25:44.511 --> 00:25:46.430
the two of them are made it together

342
00:25:48.890 --> 00:25:53.420
and now instead of towing at about three miles an hour,

343
00:25:53.421 --> 00:25:58.160
I can tow it about seven miles an hour.
And in addition to that,

344
00:25:58.190 --> 00:26:02.750
it makes it a lot easier to get in and out of the submarine in the middle of the

345
00:26:02.751 --> 00:26:03.200
ocean,

346
00:26:03.200 --> 00:26:08.200
which was basically unsafe in anything but super calm seas previously.

347
00:26:09.740 --> 00:26:14.360
But with this arrangement you can get in and out in about four to six foot seas.

348
00:26:15.170 --> 00:26:20.170
So basically thanks to the map that the Schmidt Ocean institute generated.

349
00:26:21.950 --> 00:26:26.690
It's opened up a new error of exploration for,

350
00:26:26.691 --> 00:26:30.950
for me around [inaudible] to go and explore new spots.

351
00:26:32.480 --> 00:26:37.400
And there is a parting shot of a hammerhead cruising down the wall.

352
00:26:37.610 --> 00:26:41.090
And now I have another video that I'll,
uh,

353
00:26:42.080 --> 00:26:45.030
talk through a lot of the same animals we've seen,

354
00:26:45.031 --> 00:26:47.850
but you'll see how they move and then we'll have questions.

355
00:26:48.680 --> 00:26:49.513
<v 1>Yeah,</v>

356
00:27:28.220 --> 00:27:33.220
<v 0>you only really need to hold the hatch tied enough just to put pressure on the o</v>

357
00:27:33.441 --> 00:27:37.370
ring to seal for the first couple of feet and in,
once you get under water,

358
00:27:37.371 --> 00:27:38.930
the pressure seal said for you

359
00:28:46.370 --> 00:28:49.130
that's cruising along the top of the second wall,

360
00:28:49.430 --> 00:28:51.590
which is also where the thermocline is.

361
00:28:52.960 --> 00:28:57.460
There are a lot of animals pelagics like,
uh,
different kinds of sharks,

362
00:28:57.461 --> 00:28:58.810
Mantas,
tuna,

363
00:28:59.230 --> 00:29:03.940
that that's your best chance of seeing them as along the top of that second
wall.

364
00:29:04.560 --> 00:29:04.880
<v 1>Okay.</v>

365
00:29:04.880 --> 00:29:07.430
<v 0>That's a type of deep water sand tiger shark.</v>

366
00:29:09.620 --> 00:29:10.220
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

367
00:29:10.220 --> 00:29:14.830
<v 0>This is a pirate zone,
which uh,</v>

368
00:29:14.870 --> 00:29:16.430
this one's about eight feet long,

369
00:29:16.431 --> 00:29:21.431
but they can get over 20 feet long and they actively swim.

370
00:29:32.660 --> 00:29:37.100
They're called pirate zone because Tyra for Greek fire,

371
00:29:38.210 --> 00:29:41.360
they're capable of making a very bright bioluminescence.

372
00:30:05.990 --> 00:30:09.860
This is it about 500 feet films with only natural light.

373
00:30:11.120 --> 00:30:15.500
Everything looks very blue down there be with no artificial light because that's

374
00:30:15.501 --> 00:30:18.170
the only color left in the light waves making it down there.

375
00:30:44.100 --> 00:30:49.100
This is another kind of siphon of four that you only start seeing it around 2000

376
00:30:49.231 --> 00:30:54.231
feet and they connect themselves to the bottom with a little tentacle arms about

377
00:30:54.901 --> 00:30:57.300
three feet off and if you get close to him,
they swim away.

378
00:30:57.950 --> 00:31:01.230
And this is a wonky eye jewel squid they have,

379
00:31:04.010 --> 00:31:04.950
is it another kind of fish?

380
00:31:10.140 --> 00:31:14.100
Was there a squat lobsters on a sea fan?
About eight feet across.

381
00:31:23.790 --> 00:31:24.623
<v 1>Okay.</v>

382
00:31:27.860 --> 00:31:32.860
<v 0>This is a new drink that's about the size of a football and they live pretty</v>

383
00:31:33.471 --> 00:31:38.471
much only between 710,000 feet and are nocturnal and if

384
00:31:40.790 --> 00:31:44.240
you hang out by him too long and disturb them,
they jump off the bottom and swim.

385
00:31:45.860 --> 00:31:48.920
This is a giant isopod.
They can get about a foot and a half long.

386
00:31:49.610 --> 00:31:53.510
When I go with Bait for the sharks,
they're often show up.

387
00:31:53.570 --> 00:31:55.130
This is a polychaete worm.

388
00:31:56.020 --> 00:31:59.150
They're very common on sandy spots below a thousand feet.

389
00:31:59.240 --> 00:32:03.500
They look like a little yellow slime ball,
but then can jump up and swim.

390
00:32:04.430 --> 00:32:07.640
This is a orange roughy,
one of the worst fish to eat.

391
00:32:07.820 --> 00:32:10.460
The only way they catch them is deep water trawling.

392
00:32:10.590 --> 00:32:13.220
They live over close to 200 years old.

393
00:32:31.010 --> 00:32:34.550
This is a sea cucumber.
They're very common.
Some dives,

394
00:32:35.000 --> 00:32:39.140
I might see 100 of them and usually they just sit on the bottom.

395
00:32:39.290 --> 00:32:44.290
Every once in a while they get a sniff of some food somewhere and they jump up

396
00:32:44.930 --> 00:32:49.430
and swim for a while to relocate is the Dumbo octopus and action

397
00:33:12.730 --> 00:33:14.050
to six scale.
Again,

398
00:33:14.860 --> 00:33:19.860
scientists like to have these scaling lasers on the sub.

399
00:33:19.871 --> 00:33:21.610
They're 10 centimeters apart,

400
00:33:21.670 --> 00:33:25.990
so like right now you can freeze a frame of that and measure everything on the

401
00:33:25.991 --> 00:33:27.490
shark.
Precisely.

402
00:33:45.840 --> 00:33:50.840
So what looks like worms on there are actually starfish called snake stars may

403
00:33:52.710 --> 00:33:55.650
have symbiotic relationships with the corals.

404
00:34:17.840 --> 00:34:22.370
This is a kind of angler fish and they have four legs and a little lower between

405
00:34:22.371 --> 00:34:25.490
their eyes.
They can swim but they prefer to waddle.

406
00:34:41.210 --> 00:34:46.190
That's the same type of starfish we saw in the still of the deep water corals

407
00:34:46.640 --> 00:34:50.000
there.
Brisson good starfish there.
Pacific and Atlantic.

408
00:34:50.320 --> 00:34:52.790
And this is a Venus fly trap,
an enemy.

409
00:34:58.010 --> 00:34:59.330
This is a sea Robin.

410
00:35:00.110 --> 00:35:05.110
It's got prongs on its face that it can dig in the dirt with and its pectoral

411
00:35:05.331 --> 00:35:10.331
fins have evolved into clause that it pulls itself along the bottom with,

412
00:35:12.610 --> 00:35:14.540
this is a,
another kind of siphon a four.

413
00:35:15.070 --> 00:35:19.960
When you first approach them there in like a spiral chandelier

414
00:35:50.900 --> 00:35:53.980
<v 1>that's about a foot long
and about</v>

415
00:35:54.110 --> 00:35:55.040
<v 0>2,400 feet.</v>

416
00:35:55.270 --> 00:35:56.103
<v 1>Okay.</v>

417
00:36:33.200 --> 00:36:35.050
<v 0>Think that's it.
Any questions?</v>

418
00:36:44.060 --> 00:36:44.893
Yes.

419
00:36:45.180 --> 00:36:50.070
<v 2>Yeah.
Thank you for,
for your talk.
I'm in all of your engineering abilities.</v>

420
00:36:50.340 --> 00:36:53.240
How do you not die when you do these things?
I mean,
what,

421
00:36:53.241 --> 00:36:56.040
what is your approach to,
to safety?

422
00:36:56.041 --> 00:37:00.260
How if you learned to make these dives safe and um,

423
00:37:00.360 --> 00:37:04.910
what kind of sort of redundant safety measures have you built in your,
in your

424
00:37:05.540 --> 00:37:07.790
<v 0>well,
so the way that I educated myself on,</v>

425
00:37:07.820 --> 00:37:12.590
on how to build a machine like this and not die was going and meeting with as

426
00:37:12.591 --> 00:37:17.591
many people as I could that had expertise at doing such things and also

427
00:37:18.440 --> 00:37:23.440
physically looking at other vehicles and basically taking careful notes on how

428
00:37:23.871 --> 00:37:24.890
they were constructed.

429
00:37:25.490 --> 00:37:30.140
One thing that really works to my advantage in this,
uh,

430
00:37:30.470 --> 00:37:35.470
the first one was a cylinder and the new one is a series of spheres.

431
00:37:36.740 --> 00:37:39.950
But basically if you're going to go below a couple hundred feet,

432
00:37:39.980 --> 00:37:43.460
you have to be some combination of cylinders.
Are Spheres,

433
00:37:43.670 --> 00:37:48.670
the circular shape and it's a scalable problem.

434
00:37:48.741 --> 00:37:49.430
So you can't,

435
00:37:49.430 --> 00:37:54.430
and they're only a certain types of steels that are preferred to use for

436
00:37:54.801 --> 00:37:56.930
pressure vessels.
So your,

437
00:37:57.110 --> 00:38:01.910
your variables are fairly limited in terms of what you're left with is,

438
00:38:02.090 --> 00:38:05.480
you know,
you can extrapolate.
All right,
this,

439
00:38:05.630 --> 00:38:07.910
this submarine was made out of that kind of steel,

440
00:38:07.911 --> 00:38:11.660
went this deep and was a circle of this thickness.

441
00:38:12.620 --> 00:38:17.620
And it was really kind of working engineering from that where where I managed

442
00:38:18.231 --> 00:38:19.250
to,
you know,

443
00:38:19.280 --> 00:38:23.690
build a safe craft redundancy is

444
00:38:24.620 --> 00:38:25.453
<v 1>uh,</v>

445
00:38:26.300 --> 00:38:29.360
<v 0>a big thing in submersibles I have.</v>

446
00:38:29.420 --> 00:38:33.380
So I waved my passengers before they get in and when we fled the battles

447
00:38:33.381 --> 00:38:36.700
compartments were only sinking by maybe 10 or 20 pounds.

448
00:38:37.330 --> 00:38:41.980
And then we have two separate high pressure air systems where we're able to add,

449
00:38:42.450 --> 00:38:42.850
uh,

450
00:38:42.850 --> 00:38:47.200
Erda to two separate ballots compartments where we could gain over 1,500 pounds

451
00:38:47.201 --> 00:38:48.034
of bland seat.

452
00:38:48.640 --> 00:38:53.640
And we also have a single bolt we can turn and let loose about a 350 pound a

453
00:38:55.030 --> 00:38:58.180
block of led.
We also carry three days of air.

454
00:38:58.540 --> 00:39:03.540
And the submerse bill also has fully redundant propulsion systems because of

455
00:39:05.501 --> 00:39:08.110
where I operate most submersibles,
uh,

456
00:39:08.111 --> 00:39:12.700
when it have fully redundant propulsion and if they had a motor failure,

457
00:39:12.701 --> 00:39:15.820
they would simply surface and call their support ship.

458
00:39:16.300 --> 00:39:19.870
But I'm operating without a support ships.
So I,
uh,

459
00:39:20.200 --> 00:39:23.980
because of where I operate,
I'm only 800 feet from the dock to the trench wall.

460
00:39:24.220 --> 00:39:28.990
But the flip side of that is if I came up and the wind was blowing me back

461
00:39:28.991 --> 00:39:33.520
towards the reef,
by the time of boat came to Tomi in,
I might be up on the reef.

462
00:39:33.550 --> 00:39:36.100
So in addition to those other things,

463
00:39:36.101 --> 00:39:38.620
I have a separate battery banks,

464
00:39:38.621 --> 00:39:42.000
four motors when I only need two separate switching.

465
00:39:43.250 --> 00:39:43.500
<v 1>Okay.</v>

466
00:39:43.500 --> 00:39:48.490
<v 0>And so even though the motors I use aren't the most reliable kinds,
they're,</v>

467
00:39:48.560 --> 00:39:50.700
they're brushed motors instead of,

468
00:39:50.730 --> 00:39:53.430
you could spend 10 times the amount for brushless motors,

469
00:39:53.490 --> 00:39:56.730
but I have motors fail maybe once or twice a year.

470
00:39:56.731 --> 00:40:00.180
And my passengers never know because I have a complete second set.

471
00:40:00.840 --> 00:40:04.620
Thank you for coming in for presenting to us.
Uh,
chuck questions.

472
00:40:04.650 --> 00:40:08.490
What was the best and the worst moment for you doing the dice?

473
00:40:08.870 --> 00:40:09.200
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

474
00:40:09.200 --> 00:40:11.330
<v 0>Um,
well,</v>

475
00:40:11.360 --> 00:40:16.360
the best moments are when I see things that I've never seen before and that

476
00:40:16.491 --> 00:40:18.950
sense of discovery and awe and

477
00:40:20.600 --> 00:40:23.100
just not knowing what you're looking at,

478
00:40:23.130 --> 00:40:26.170
which I think is in like a way I'm a,

479
00:40:26.171 --> 00:40:30.630
I'm a little bit envious of people that traveled before photography.

480
00:40:32.250 --> 00:40:34.560
And you only had a,
you know,

481
00:40:34.561 --> 00:40:39.370
like a rough sketch or even imagine being like the first people crossing the,

482
00:40:39.371 --> 00:40:43.410
the continent on wagons and coming across the Grand Canyon and not even having a

483
00:40:43.411 --> 00:40:48.411
full concept of what you are going to see versus like now you can look at

484
00:40:48.451 --> 00:40:52.680
somebody's photos on trip advisor and like pretty well understand what it is

485
00:40:52.681 --> 00:40:56.430
before you ever left your house.
Uh,
in the deep ocean.

486
00:40:56.431 --> 00:41:00.750
You can still have that sense of on discovery because they're literally,

487
00:41:01.040 --> 00:41:01.260
you know,

488
00:41:01.260 --> 00:41:05.880
I'm discovering new species with scientists that they're flipping out and

489
00:41:05.881 --> 00:41:08.160
they're the world experts.
Uh,
the,

490
00:41:08.700 --> 00:41:13.700
the worst moment I've ever had in the sub was I surfaced after about six,

491
00:41:15.601 --> 00:41:20.601
seven hours from a shark dive at night and the weather had deteriorated,

492
00:41:21.810 --> 00:41:26.810
deteriorated to the point there was probably eight to 10 foot waves that were

493
00:41:27.450 --> 00:41:30.390
almost rolling the submarine completely over.

494
00:41:30.690 --> 00:41:35.480
And I had to get through the channel,
which is about as wide as for me to you.

495
00:41:36.020 --> 00:41:40.820
And in addition to all that,
there was a power outage on shore.

496
00:41:40.821 --> 00:41:43.790
So I had a compass and I knew I was looking straight at the island,

497
00:41:44.000 --> 00:41:48.650
but I couldn't see it because all the lights were out.
But I didn't realize that.

498
00:41:48.651 --> 00:41:50.750
I thought it was in addition to all right,

499
00:41:50.800 --> 00:41:53.900
these waves are bigger than anything I've ever been in in the waves are so big

500
00:41:54.260 --> 00:41:57.920
they're blocking my view.
So that was fairly terrifying.

501
00:42:01.870 --> 00:42:02.703
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

502
00:42:03.870 --> 00:42:05.010
<v 3>Hi,
thanks for coming out.</v>

503
00:42:05.460 --> 00:42:09.480
I saw chasing coral last year was like really hit me hard about,
you know,

504
00:42:09.481 --> 00:42:11.340
the impacts of climate change and the ocean.

505
00:42:11.640 --> 00:42:15.030
I was just wondering if you've actually personally seen any changes in any of

506
00:42:15.031 --> 00:42:18.930
the dives you've done over the last few decades that you think are attributed to

507
00:42:19.230 --> 00:42:20.063
climate change.

508
00:42:21.660 --> 00:42:22.493
<v 0>Um,</v>

509
00:42:24.670 --> 00:42:28.610
we just had our first bleaching event where I live,
but,
uh,

510
00:42:28.650 --> 00:42:33.650
fortunately the quarrels off of Honduras or doing a pretty good job of

511
00:42:34.921 --> 00:42:39.480
rebounding the reef is relatively healthy compared to the rest of the

512
00:42:39.481 --> 00:42:44.340
Mesoamerican reef.
However,
in the 20 years that I've been diving,

513
00:42:44.370 --> 00:42:45.280
I would say I,

514
00:42:45.390 --> 00:42:50.390
I have definitely seen a marked decline in large pledge IHC species or pledge

515
00:42:52.440 --> 00:42:55.320
like tuna and hammerhead sharks.

516
00:42:56.100 --> 00:43:00.090
I think their numbers have come down 90% in 20 years.

517
00:43:00.570 --> 00:43:03.240
And on the flip side,

518
00:43:03.241 --> 00:43:06.540
the amount of plastic in the ocean is skyrocketing.

519
00:43:06.541 --> 00:43:08.490
And I definitely see evidence of that.

520
00:43:09.980 --> 00:43:13.660
<v 4>I read on your website about how you had a,
uh,</v>

521
00:43:14.050 --> 00:43:18.020
a failure with a window cracking and I was wondering if you could tell us about

522
00:43:18.021 --> 00:43:22.160
that and then maybe,
uh,
why you think the window cracked?

523
00:43:22.161 --> 00:43:25.100
Like what was the failure mode there?

524
00:43:25.620 --> 00:43:25.860
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

525
00:43:25.860 --> 00:43:27.720
<v 0>Um,
well</v>

526
00:43:30.470 --> 00:43:34.460
I'm not sure which story was on the,
uh,
the website.
There's been actually,

527
00:43:35.710 --> 00:43:40.180
well windows cracking,
but the,
uh,
that one was the,
uh,

528
00:43:40.181 --> 00:43:45.181
the first sub and I designed it for 600 feet and then I kind of kept pushing it,

529
00:43:48.300 --> 00:43:53.080
uh,
and took it down to 725 feet.
And shortly thereafter,

530
00:43:53.081 --> 00:43:57.460
actually on the way back up was the first window cracking in.

531
00:43:57.461 --> 00:44:02.461
The most dramatic of all of them were basically crack right through the middle

532
00:44:02.921 --> 00:44:05.120
and water was spraying in the passengers space.

533
00:44:05.121 --> 00:44:10.121
But we surfaced in a couple of minutes with maybe five gallons of water in

534
00:44:11.721 --> 00:44:15.920
there.
I had the presence of mind to,
uh,
take his camera and wrap it in a towel.

535
00:44:16.110 --> 00:44:18.380
Nothing got damaged.
But,
uh,

536
00:44:18.410 --> 00:44:23.410
basically what happened was the entire hall was being tweaked to where the

537
00:44:24.710 --> 00:44:28.370
window wasn't being pressed flat against the surface anymore.

538
00:44:28.371 --> 00:44:32.550
It was being twisted and that was what caused the failure.

539
00:44:33.720 --> 00:44:37.440
So,
so when the submarine was coming up at untwisted very quickly,

540
00:44:38.180 --> 00:44:41.600
it's a,
there's a time factor,

541
00:44:42.800 --> 00:44:47.540
basically like had I just stayed at the 20 feet deeper,

542
00:44:48.270 --> 00:44:51.830
a couple minutes longer,
it's still what a cracked it was.

543
00:44:52.820 --> 00:44:57.350
A with plastic,
much like a glass windows.

544
00:44:57.351 --> 00:45:00.650
Eventually like start getting droopy on old enough buildings,

545
00:45:00.890 --> 00:45:03.860
a plastic window on a submarine.
Uh,

546
00:45:03.890 --> 00:45:06.500
let's say it a thousand hours underwater.

547
00:45:06.800 --> 00:45:10.730
It's actually half as strong as it was when he first got down there.
So it,

548
00:45:10.731 --> 00:45:11.960
it was the time factor.

549
00:45:16.120 --> 00:45:20.980
Hi.
Thanks for coming.
Um,
the island,
you chose what's,
what,
what's it called?

550
00:45:21.070 --> 00:45:23.290
Row a Tan.
It's,
it's beautiful.

551
00:45:24.190 --> 00:45:27.670
What other locations would be ideal?

552
00:45:27.700 --> 00:45:31.120
Like if you couldn't go there?
Yeah.
Um,

553
00:45:31.700 --> 00:45:36.700
I've invested a great deal of energy looking at other locations and traveled to

554
00:45:39.170 --> 00:45:40.610
a good number of them as well.

555
00:45:41.750 --> 00:45:46.750
And Road 10 is actually pretty close to the ideal location.

556
00:45:48.000 --> 00:45:52.730
Uh,
you need deep water close to shore,
preferably on the lease side of an island,

557
00:45:52.731 --> 00:45:55.250
no strong currents,
uh,

558
00:45:55.460 --> 00:45:58.670
close to an international airport and a customer base.

559
00:46:00.300 --> 00:46:04.760
And most of the other places around the world that have those things already

560
00:46:04.761 --> 00:46:09.470
have a cruise ship port,
a commercial,
a shipping port,

561
00:46:10.730 --> 00:46:14.390
uh,
military.
But like for example,

562
00:46:14.391 --> 00:46:16.910
the tongue of the ocean in The Bahamas.
Great location.

563
00:46:17.450 --> 00:46:21.860
There's been a military navy base for submarines there since I think the

564
00:46:21.861 --> 00:46:23.780
fifties.
Uh,

565
00:46:24.470 --> 00:46:29.470
Bahamas has great spots but has cruise ships that,

566
00:46:30.070 --> 00:46:35.070
so there was another operation in the Cayman Islands and for example,

567
00:46:36.830 --> 00:46:38.270
when they were operating there,

568
00:46:38.271 --> 00:46:42.230
they had to share the same harbor with all the commercial traffic for the
island,

569
00:46:42.620 --> 00:46:45.080
whereas the bay that I operate out of,

570
00:46:45.770 --> 00:46:49.460
so the island has so many natural harbors,

571
00:46:49.461 --> 00:46:54.461
I would say 30 for a 40 mile long island that every entity has its own harbor.

572
00:46:58.010 --> 00:47:02.060
It's really an ideal spot.
And how long does it take to fly there from here?

573
00:47:02.550 --> 00:47:07.280
Um,
two,
two hours.
That's really close.
Yeah.
Yeah.

574
00:47:07.490 --> 00:47:10.730
Awesome mate.
Two hours from Houston United flight.

575
00:47:10.790 --> 00:47:15.470
We have direct flights from Miami and Houston and Atlanta.

576
00:47:15.860 --> 00:47:18.680
You talked in the beginning of your presentation about the advancements that

577
00:47:18.681 --> 00:47:21.290
have been made in the last 20,
30 years since you first started doing this.

578
00:47:21.320 --> 00:47:24.470
[inaudible] curious to hear of what you think in the next 20 years,

579
00:47:24.471 --> 00:47:27.250
what the next big thing has to happen in the industry.
MMM.

580
00:47:32.130 --> 00:47:37.130
I think a three d printing has enormous potential for making a hall that picture

581
00:47:39.751 --> 00:47:44.190
like a bird's bone and how it's a matrix of mostly space,

582
00:47:44.191 --> 00:47:49.110
but has an internal trust that's giving it incredible strength and lightweight.

583
00:47:49.770 --> 00:47:54.510
The limiting factor on how deepest submersible hell can go is strength to weight

584
00:47:54.511 --> 00:47:58.710
ratio.
And that's why,
uh,
some submersibles,

585
00:47:58.740 --> 00:48:03.570
well they're testing one right now that's made out of carbon fiber that will be

586
00:48:03.571 --> 00:48:08.571
for 4,000 meters and we'll be the deepest privately owned vehicle of its kind.

587
00:48:09.720 --> 00:48:13.920
Uh,
carbon fiber has a lot of potential,

588
00:48:13.921 --> 00:48:16.020
but if you could do something like three d,

589
00:48:16.021 --> 00:48:21.021
print out a titanium or aluminum or you would have something that could go

590
00:48:21.540 --> 00:48:23.670
almost full ocean depth very affordably.

591
00:48:24.030 --> 00:48:29.030
Right now all the 6,000 meter submersibles rely on a titanium sphere,

592
00:48:31.950 --> 00:48:36.950
which is millions of dollars to create extremely technical to weld,

593
00:48:39.330 --> 00:48:44.330
like has to be done in a vacuum chamber with a laser beam and is still won't

594
00:48:47.581 --> 00:48:51.690
float.
So to counteract all the weight of that sphere,

595
00:48:51.720 --> 00:48:56.720
they have to use very expensive foam that has glass micro spheres in it.

596
00:48:59.280 --> 00:49:01.110
And then you've added a,

597
00:49:01.290 --> 00:49:05.520
you basically doubled the overall vehicle weight by just putting all this foam

598
00:49:05.521 --> 00:49:06.354
on it,

599
00:49:06.570 --> 00:49:09.360
just to counteract the weight of all the metal you had to put into the hall.

600
00:49:09.660 --> 00:49:14.520
If there was a way to make three d print that where maybe it was three times as

601
00:49:14.521 --> 00:49:17.700
thick,
but it was mostly airspace and internal trusses,

602
00:49:18.180 --> 00:49:20.370
which would be a nightmare to,
you know,

603
00:49:21.090 --> 00:49:25.470
manufacturer in any traditional way,
that would be a major breakthrough.

604
00:49:29.540 --> 00:49:31.410
<v 5>Hi.
Hi.
Um,
so you,</v>

605
00:49:31.411 --> 00:49:36.050
you bring a lot of like civilians and down to the bottom of the ocean.
Yeah.

606
00:49:36.210 --> 00:49:37.043
<v 1>Uh,</v>

607
00:49:38.440 --> 00:49:41.380
<v 5>I read on your site that to like see one of those six skilled sharks,</v>

608
00:49:41.381 --> 00:49:45.820
you've gotta be prepared to like be down there in total darkness for like eight

609
00:49:45.821 --> 00:49:48.370
hours.
Do People Freak out on you?

610
00:49:48.400 --> 00:49:50.860
I'm like getting claustrophobic looking at this slide show.

611
00:49:51.370 --> 00:49:55.630
<v 0>No.
Uh,
I'm actually never had anybody freak out underwater.</v>

612
00:49:56.500 --> 00:50:00.070
Every once in a while,
somebody,
when they first get in on the dock,

613
00:50:00.100 --> 00:50:04.030
they get back out.
But I think they,
uh,

614
00:50:04.870 --> 00:50:07.600
you know,
they've been on the website,
then they know what they're in for.

615
00:50:07.990 --> 00:50:11.590
And actually,
um,
even though it's a,

616
00:50:11.591 --> 00:50:16.591
it's a confined area to spend that amount of time in and it's cold and a little

617
00:50:17.590 --> 00:50:21.550
uncomfortable when that shark swims by,
all of a sudden,

618
00:50:21.551 --> 00:50:24.190
it feels like a very safe place.

619
00:50:27.490 --> 00:50:31.450
<v 1>[inaudible].</v>
