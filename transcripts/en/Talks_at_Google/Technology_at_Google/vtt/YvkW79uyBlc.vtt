1
00:00:06.140 --> 00:00:10.250
Thank you for coming.
I want to let you know that this is a coming of age memoir,

2
00:00:10.340 --> 00:00:14.390
so it's like don't really know much about my father's business life just in case

3
00:00:14.391 --> 00:00:18.690
anybody wants to get up and go like,
oh,
um,

4
00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:21.950
this memoir took me a long time to write.
It's probably,

5
00:00:21.951 --> 00:00:24.590
I'd probably memorize generally or artistic projects.

6
00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:26.780
My guess is they often take a long time,

7
00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:30.700
but it took me a while because in the very beginning I found myself,
um,

8
00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:34.450
sort of disappearing on the pages.
And this is a,

9
00:00:34.470 --> 00:00:37.580
this is a coming of age memoir about a girl,

10
00:00:37.581 --> 00:00:41.550
me growing up in the eighties and nineties in,
um,

11
00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:46.280
silicon and you know,
California,
northern California,
Silicon Valley,
um,

12
00:00:46.730 --> 00:00:50.360
and against the backdrop of a complicated family.

13
00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:52.920
And,
um,

14
00:00:53.390 --> 00:00:57.860
so it was problematic if I wasn't showing up on the pages,
I think.

15
00:00:58.430 --> 00:01:01.370
So some of the scenes would be kind of good.
They'd have my parents,

16
00:01:01.371 --> 00:01:03.410
they'd have a little bit of action.
I had to figure out,

17
00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:06.020
you have to write a scene.
It turns out if you're going to write a memoir,

18
00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:08.450
I could write,
but I wrote and wrote essays.

19
00:01:08.451 --> 00:01:11.750
And if you write an essay for this long,
this is a 400 page book,

20
00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:16.190
you sort of lose everyone after page 10,
I guess.
Um,
because it's so condensed.

21
00:01:16.191 --> 00:01:20.780
So instead,
um,
I had to learn to write scenes,
um,

22
00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:26.300
which mean that I'm giving you,
I'm letting you live in the moments of my past,

23
00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:30.070
I guess.
Um,
and uh,

24
00:01:30.110 --> 00:01:34.460
but I was disappearing in them and which,
and they were so,

25
00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:38.900
so the stakes,
the stakes of writing this memoir,

26
00:01:38.901 --> 00:01:43.901
I felt kind of high because I think that the last thing I wanted to do was be

27
00:01:44.421 --> 00:01:49.310
this,
um,
be a person,
the child of a celebrity essentially,

28
00:01:49.311 --> 00:01:54.110
and be writing a memoir because celebrity memoir like cringe.
Um,

29
00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:57.170
and,
but I,
I felt,

30
00:01:57.560 --> 00:02:02.210
I guess that there was a kind of quality of disappearing in my own life and that

31
00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:06.020
if I would write this book,
I could write other books after,

32
00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:09.740
but I couldn't write those other books until I kind of solved this disappearing

33
00:02:09.741 --> 00:02:13.640
issue and this shame issue.
It's almost like,
um,
you know,

34
00:02:13.641 --> 00:02:16.520
in high school English when you have to like identify the themes of different

35
00:02:16.521 --> 00:02:19.490
books.
And even though this is a nonfiction book,

36
00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:22.490
when I kind of condensed it down to its essence,

37
00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:25.940
there was a theme and it was a kind of question of illegitimacy did I have a

38
00:02:25.941 --> 00:02:29.450
right to stand on the ground,
my own story?

39
00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:33.980
Why did I have a right to sort of exist?
Um,
and so in that sense,

40
00:02:33.981 --> 00:02:35.810
even though I'm saying it rather dramatically,

41
00:02:35.811 --> 00:02:40.760
I guess it's kind of universal because I think that's a more common question.
Um,

42
00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:45.800
so what happened?
The,
the fix for the disappearance I think was that I,
um,

43
00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:50.720
one of the inspirations that I read Tobias Wolfe's this boy's life and he,
um,

44
00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:55.220
I noticed that the more it's a memoir and I noticed that the more sort of

45
00:02:55.221 --> 00:02:59.860
naughty and devious and bad young was,

46
00:03:00.730 --> 00:03:05.200
the more I totally loved him.
So I was like,
oh,
okay.
Um,

47
00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:06.813
so I have to,

48
00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:11.680
so I started to access my character through noticing where I wasn't,
where I was,

49
00:03:11.681 --> 00:03:14.800
where I did things that were kind of shameful.
And then as I wrote them,

50
00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:18.610
the scenes were pretty good because they had life to them.

51
00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:23.780
And so then I guess in that way I sort of began to appear on the pages.
Um,

52
00:03:23.890 --> 00:03:26.880
so I'll start with,
um,
I'll redo it from a,

53
00:03:26.990 --> 00:03:28.870
a little bit of the beginning of the book.

54
00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:33.040
This is a sort of am terribly embarrassing story,

55
00:03:33.130 --> 00:03:35.430
which happened obviously,
um,

56
00:03:36.520 --> 00:03:40.160
of like noticing that I was taking things.
Um,

57
00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:43.210
so like many of the stories in this book,
I thought,
Oh God,
I can't include it.

58
00:03:43.211 --> 00:03:46.390
But then ultimately it's in here.
Three months before he died,

59
00:03:46.510 --> 00:03:48.790
I began to steal things from my father's house.

60
00:03:49.090 --> 00:03:52.240
I wandered around barefoot and slipped objects into my pockets.

61
00:03:52.510 --> 00:03:57.220
I took blush toothpaste to chipped finger bowls and sell it on blue,

62
00:03:57.520 --> 00:03:58.900
a bottle of nail Polish,

63
00:03:59.110 --> 00:04:03.290
a pair of Warren Patent leather ballet slippers and four faded white pillow

64
00:04:03.291 --> 00:04:08.170
cases,
the color of old teeth.
After stealing each item,
I felt sated.

65
00:04:08.470 --> 00:04:10.840
I promised myself that this would be the last time,

66
00:04:11.260 --> 00:04:15.040
but soon the urge to take something else would arrive again.
Like thirst.

67
00:04:15.520 --> 00:04:17.320
I tiptoed into my father's room,

68
00:04:17.530 --> 00:04:20.260
careful to step over the creaky floorboard at the entrance.

69
00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:23.620
This room had been his study when he could still climb the stairs,

70
00:04:23.890 --> 00:04:24.760
but he slept here.

71
00:04:24.761 --> 00:04:29.260
Now it was cluttered with books and mail and bottles of medicine.

72
00:04:29.530 --> 00:04:34.390
Glass apples would an apples awards and magazines and stacks of paper that were

73
00:04:34.391 --> 00:04:37.750
framed prints by his Sui of twilight and sunset at Temple's,

74
00:04:38.080 --> 00:04:41.140
a patch of pink light stretched out on a wall beside him.

75
00:04:41.830 --> 00:04:45.310
He was propped up in bed wearing shorts.
His legs were bare,

76
00:04:45.311 --> 00:04:49.000
and then his arms bent up like a grasshoppers.
Hey,
lease.

77
00:04:49.001 --> 00:04:53.590
He said Seg,
you ramp a chaise stood beside him.
He'd been around recently.

78
00:04:53.591 --> 00:04:58.250
When I came to visit a short Brazilian man with sparkling Brown eyes,
the rim,

79
00:04:58.251 --> 00:05:02.530
pushpay was a Buddhist monk with a scratchy voice who were brown robes over a

80
00:05:02.531 --> 00:05:07.240
round belly.
We call him by his title to Benton holy men,

81
00:05:07.450 --> 00:05:11.440
where sometimes born in the west.
Now in places like Brazil,
to me,

82
00:05:11.441 --> 00:05:15.810
he didn't seem wholly,
he wasn't distant or inscrutable near Rasa,

83
00:05:15.850 --> 00:05:18.910
black canvas bag of nutrients,
hummed with a motor and a pump.

84
00:05:19.180 --> 00:05:22.000
The tube disappearing somewhere under my father's sheets.

85
00:05:22.450 --> 00:05:24.670
It's a good idea to touch his feet.
The ramp.

86
00:05:24.680 --> 00:05:28.600
Shay said putting his hands around my father's foot in the bed like this.

87
00:05:29.020 --> 00:05:33.130
I didn't know if the foot touching was supposed to be for my father or for me or

88
00:05:33.131 --> 00:05:37.990
for both of us.
Okay.
I said and took his other foot and it's thick sock.

89
00:05:38.020 --> 00:05:42.400
Even though it was strange watching my father's face because when he Winston

90
00:05:42.460 --> 00:05:47.320
pain or anger,
it looked similar to when he started to smile.
That feels good.

91
00:05:47.350 --> 00:05:49.390
My father said closing his eyes.

92
00:05:49.720 --> 00:05:53.230
I glanced at the chest of drawers beside him and at the shelves on the other

93
00:05:53.231 --> 00:05:55.240
side of the room for objects I wanted.

94
00:05:55.870 --> 00:05:59.090
Even though I knew I wouldn't dare steal something out right in front of him

95
00:05:59.900 --> 00:06:02.390
while he slept,
I wandered through the house looking for,

96
00:06:02.391 --> 00:06:05.720
I didn't know what a nurse sat on the couch in the living room,

97
00:06:05.721 --> 00:06:09.410
her hands on her lap,
listening for my father to call out for help.

98
00:06:09.830 --> 00:06:12.230
The house was quiet.
The sound's muffled.

99
00:06:12.470 --> 00:06:16.970
The white painted brick walls were dimpled like cushions in the cabinet of the

100
00:06:16.971 --> 00:06:21.650
half bath near the kitchen where there used to be a tattered copy of the

101
00:06:21.650 --> 00:06:21.950
Bhagavad Gita.

102
00:06:21.950 --> 00:06:26.950
I found a bottle of expensive rose facial mist with the door closed the light

103
00:06:27.231 --> 00:06:31.550
out sitting on the toilet seat.
I sprayed it up into the air and closed my eyes.

104
00:06:31.940 --> 00:06:36.470
The mist fell around me cool and wholly as an a forest or an old stone church,

105
00:06:36.860 --> 00:06:40.820
there was also a tube of silver lip gloss with a brush at one end and a twisting

106
00:06:40.821 --> 00:06:44.630
mechanism at the other.
That release liquid into the center of the brush.

107
00:06:44.990 --> 00:06:46.160
I had to have it.

108
00:06:46.850 --> 00:06:50.840
I stuffed the lip gloss into my pocket to take back to the one bedroom apartment

109
00:06:50.841 --> 00:06:53.060
in Greenwich village that I shared with my boyfriend,

110
00:06:53.390 --> 00:06:58.160
where I knew as much as I have ever known anything that this tube of lip gloss

111
00:06:58.161 --> 00:07:02.810
would complete my life between avoiding the housekeeper,
my brother and sisters,

112
00:07:02.811 --> 00:07:07.340
and my stepmother around the house so I wouldn't be caught stealing things or

113
00:07:07.341 --> 00:07:11.990
hurt when they didn't acknowledge me or reply to my hellos and spraying myself

114
00:07:11.991 --> 00:07:16.520
in the dark and bathroom to feel less like I was disappearing because inside the

115
00:07:16.521 --> 00:07:19.430
falling missed,
I had a sense of having an outline again,

116
00:07:19.880 --> 00:07:24.290
making efforts to see my sick father in his room began to feel like a burden,

117
00:07:24.340 --> 00:07:28.670
a nuisance.
For the past year,
I've visited every weekend,
every other month or so,

118
00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:33.350
I'd given up on the possibility of a grand reconciliation,
the kind in movies,

119
00:07:33.650 --> 00:07:37.220
but I kept coming anyway before I said goodbye,

120
00:07:37.430 --> 00:07:41.210
I went to the bathroom to miss one more time.
The spray was natural,

121
00:07:41.450 --> 00:07:44.180
which meant that over the course of a few minutes,

122
00:07:44.181 --> 00:07:48.890
it no longer smells sharp like roses,
but fitted and stinky like a swamp.

123
00:07:48.891 --> 00:07:52.340
Although I didn't know it at the time.
As I came into his room,

124
00:07:52.520 --> 00:07:54.380
he was getting into a standing position.

125
00:07:54.590 --> 00:07:59.120
I watched him gather both of his legs and one arm twist himself 90 degrees by

126
00:07:59.121 --> 00:08:03.470
pushing against the headboard with the other arm and then use both arms to hoist

127
00:08:03.471 --> 00:08:07.400
his own legs over the edge of the bed and onto the floor.
When we hugged,

128
00:08:07.610 --> 00:08:12.230
I could feel his vertebrae,
his ribs,
he smelled musty like medicine,
sweat,

129
00:08:12.620 --> 00:08:16.790
I'll be back soon.
I said,
we detached and I started walking away.

130
00:08:17.090 --> 00:08:21.440
Lease.
Yeah,
you smell like a toilet.
Um,

131
00:08:21.590 --> 00:08:24.050
it was the rose spray and this is one scene of many.

132
00:08:24.051 --> 00:08:28.220
I actually returned all of the things I did,
but this is not a story of,

133
00:08:28.280 --> 00:08:33.150
of theft.
Um,
although I did like the idea of theft is a,

134
00:08:33.440 --> 00:08:35.900
a kind of metaphor for what I was doing.

135
00:08:35.901 --> 00:08:39.290
There's a terror when you're writing a memoir because even if you want to write

136
00:08:39.291 --> 00:08:43.670
about yourself,
you find that you have just yourself,
um,

137
00:08:44.060 --> 00:08:47.270
you find that you necessarily pull all these other people up into your net.

138
00:08:47.570 --> 00:08:50.030
And so you have a responsibility to do the best job with them.

139
00:08:50.031 --> 00:08:52.310
You can to be kind and to be honest,

140
00:08:52.760 --> 00:08:57.760
and to try to capture some of their character as it at least as it relates to

141
00:08:59.071 --> 00:09:01.240
your own life.
But sometimes,
um,

142
00:09:01.800 --> 00:09:06.120
you weren't able to capture necessarily the fullness of everyone's character.
Um,

143
00:09:06.690 --> 00:09:09.480
you're capturing how they're interesting to you and you're using them in a

144
00:09:09.481 --> 00:09:12.930
certain way to tell an emotional story of yourself.

145
00:09:13.050 --> 00:09:15.770
But I did get an email once from my mother's,
um,

146
00:09:15.810 --> 00:09:19.800
ex boyfriend and the email was titled Correction.

147
00:09:20.790 --> 00:09:24.900
And I thought,
oh no.
And I went into it and,
and he said,
um,

148
00:09:25.380 --> 00:09:26.190
that I had,

149
00:09:26.190 --> 00:09:29.460
that there was a person named Ron and my book and perhaps I had described him,

150
00:09:29.790 --> 00:09:30.311
you know,
and,
and,

151
00:09:30.311 --> 00:09:34.140
and that this person named Ron and my book had many similarities to this

152
00:09:34.141 --> 00:09:38.010
boyfriend who was also named Ron in that they both worked for NASA and that they

153
00:09:38.011 --> 00:09:40.580
both had dated my mother at a certain point.
Um,

154
00:09:40.950 --> 00:09:45.590
but that I described this person who clearly wasn't him as,
um,

155
00:09:46.290 --> 00:09:50.910
uh,
sort of having hair tufted on the sides,
like a clown and having,

156
00:09:50.970 --> 00:09:53.520
um,
having a sort of,
um,

157
00:09:54.030 --> 00:09:59.030
totally shiny bald head and walking with his feet splayed out and I'm having

158
00:09:59.791 --> 00:10:03.240
lips,
like a fish.
I thought,
Oh God.
And so he said,
I've,

159
00:10:03.241 --> 00:10:06.700
I've attached to photograph of myself for further reference.
Um,

160
00:10:06.750 --> 00:10:11.340
if you do want to describe me.
And he had a picture of Fabio.
But then I thought,

161
00:10:11.370 --> 00:10:12.370
oh no,
I have,

162
00:10:12.371 --> 00:10:16.560
I just grabbed this man who was quite wonderful in this sort of,

163
00:10:16.710 --> 00:10:21.120
not very flattering way.
And then I thought back on that scene and I realized,
oh,

164
00:10:21.121 --> 00:10:24.090
it was because I was meeting him for the very first time.

165
00:10:24.091 --> 00:10:28.560
He just started dating my mother and I felt possessive of my mother and I wasn't

166
00:10:28.561 --> 00:10:30.390
sure I liked him so much.
Um,

167
00:10:31.110 --> 00:10:33.990
and so that's why I had described him that way.

168
00:10:34.240 --> 00:10:37.830
Now that I've already described myself in a sort of compromised way,

169
00:10:37.950 --> 00:10:41.070
the only way I felt like I had permission to describe other people the way that

170
00:10:41.071 --> 00:10:45.540
they were,
and with all of their eccentricities,
as I had to describe my own.

171
00:10:45.720 --> 00:10:47.160
The other thing I can say right now,

172
00:10:47.190 --> 00:10:50.310
I'm just worried that in my scatterbrainedness I'll forget later,

173
00:10:50.311 --> 00:10:51.180
is something like,

174
00:10:51.420 --> 00:10:56.340
I'm trying to give people the chance to have their own story within the pages of

175
00:10:56.341 --> 00:10:59.700
my story.
So I think different people take different things from this book.

176
00:10:59.730 --> 00:11:01.890
They have different relationships with their parents and,

177
00:11:01.960 --> 00:11:05.310
and they had different coming of age stories and it's been sort of a victory to

178
00:11:05.311 --> 00:11:06.690
me,
this,

179
00:11:06.990 --> 00:11:11.280
this idea that I brought up people's paths for themselves because they've come

180
00:11:11.281 --> 00:11:14.850
up to me and readings and they've said,
oh,
that feels exactly like me.

181
00:11:14.851 --> 00:11:18.300
I'm a single mother.
Or they've said,
oh,
my father was like that.

182
00:11:18.301 --> 00:11:21.540
He would make jokes like that or he was difficult like that.

183
00:11:21.750 --> 00:11:25.020
And I've noticed that if you read a book at a certain point in your life,

184
00:11:25.590 --> 00:11:28.770
maybe a book that you love and then you wait 10 years and you read it again,

185
00:11:28.771 --> 00:11:30.480
it's almost like it's a totally different book.

186
00:11:31.080 --> 00:11:33.210
And I have a feeling it's not the book that changed.

187
00:11:33.270 --> 00:11:37.170
I think it's that we continue to continuously change and then,

188
00:11:37.590 --> 00:11:41.400
and then art hopefully reflects our own changes back to us.

189
00:11:41.550 --> 00:11:44.670
So I think that it's sort of a difficult thing because this book that I wrote

190
00:11:44.671 --> 00:11:48.150
about my family is now everyone else's book.
It's not mine anymore.

191
00:11:48.540 --> 00:11:51.390
And I have to kind of release it and say whatever you get out of it,

192
00:11:51.810 --> 00:11:54.160
it's what you're supposed to get out of it because it's your book.

193
00:11:54.161 --> 00:11:56.890
Now of course that's a little difficult because it's my family and sometimes I

194
00:11:56.891 --> 00:11:59.460
want to say no,
that's not what I meant.
Um,

195
00:11:59.500 --> 00:12:03.490
but that doesn't really matter anymore.
But without further due the Ron story,

196
00:12:03.970 --> 00:12:05.590
since she's become interested in Ron,

197
00:12:05.591 --> 00:12:08.290
she no longer paid attention to me as a stately.

198
00:12:08.620 --> 00:12:10.900
I thought she no longer consulted the itching.

199
00:12:11.380 --> 00:12:13.210
She was half absent with happiness,

200
00:12:13.450 --> 00:12:16.810
the same slight smile on her lips that she went when she ran up the hill to get

201
00:12:16.811 --> 00:12:19.330
the prickly pear.
It was between boyfriends,

202
00:12:19.331 --> 00:12:23.140
between the loneliness and despair that followed one and the lift that began the

203
00:12:23.141 --> 00:12:26.920
next where I hope to stay forever.
She and I,
the only team,

204
00:12:26.950 --> 00:12:31.150
the real couple on the night of the date,
Ron arrived on time.

205
00:12:31.480 --> 00:12:34.600
She was leaning over the bathroom sink doing her makeup.
When he knocked,

206
00:12:34.960 --> 00:12:38.710
I ran to open the door.
I saw right away that Ron wasn't a hippie.

207
00:12:38.980 --> 00:12:43.210
He was bald with hair tufted on the side like a clowns and had wide bushy

208
00:12:43.211 --> 00:12:47.860
eyebrows,
glasses,
rimmed with gold and large swollen lips like a fish.

209
00:12:48.130 --> 00:12:52.660
He looked clean and smelled of soap and detergent.
Hello?
I said I'm Lisa.

210
00:12:52.960 --> 00:12:57.040
My Mom's getting ready.
Nice to meet you.
He said,
holding out his hand.

211
00:12:57.400 --> 00:12:59.080
He followed me into the living room.

212
00:12:59.140 --> 00:13:03.160
I noticed that as he walked his feet splayed out dramatically to either side.

213
00:13:03.640 --> 00:13:06.130
My mother called from the bathroom.
I'll be out in a minute.

214
00:13:06.790 --> 00:13:10.210
As we pass the bookshelf.
I reached for the album of photographs of my birth.

215
00:13:10.570 --> 00:13:13.420
This was unplanned.
It surprised even me,

216
00:13:13.570 --> 00:13:17.740
one armed jutting out as if I didn't have control of my limbs and pull it out of

217
00:13:17.741 --> 00:13:20.650
its socket on the shelf.
I was seven years old at this point.

218
00:13:20.830 --> 00:13:22.900
I'd asked her to get rid of this album many times.

219
00:13:22.901 --> 00:13:26.380
She refused bringing it with us.
As we move from house to house,

220
00:13:26.410 --> 00:13:29.070
that cover was made of Brown woven grasses and because it was old,

221
00:13:29.071 --> 00:13:31.180
the grasses has started to fray at the edges.

222
00:13:31.300 --> 00:13:34.360
To me to this hinted at the shame of the contents.

223
00:13:34.570 --> 00:13:37.990
I suspected other children didn't have shameful books like this around in their

224
00:13:37.991 --> 00:13:42.100
houses.
He and I sat down on the flowered couch beside each other.

225
00:13:42.400 --> 00:13:46.270
I want to show you something I said,
just some photos of my mother and me.

226
00:13:46.990 --> 00:13:49.450
I opened the book across my lap where he could see it.

227
00:13:49.720 --> 00:13:54.280
My mother younger lying on a bed with long hair like dark water pooling around

228
00:13:54.281 --> 00:13:55.114
her face.

229
00:13:55.540 --> 00:13:59.590
These were the pictures of my birth in black and white with rounded corners.

230
00:14:00.040 --> 00:14:01.600
She had what looked like a man's shirt,

231
00:14:01.601 --> 00:14:05.320
buttoned around her chest and she was naked from the waist down with her legs

232
00:14:05.321 --> 00:14:07.360
bent and open.
In the foreground of the photo,

233
00:14:07.630 --> 00:14:11.950
I turned the page there I was emerging from between her glowing white legs like

234
00:14:11.951 --> 00:14:13.750
a turtle rising up from a pond.

235
00:14:14.410 --> 00:14:18.370
In the following picture is once I was out you could see my body wrinkled,

236
00:14:18.430 --> 00:14:21.340
my face,
wax,
white,
asymmetrical and squished.

237
00:14:21.640 --> 00:14:25.840
I felt revulsion and discussed and yet I continued to turn the pages.

238
00:14:26.200 --> 00:14:28.300
I would not have known how to articulate it.

239
00:14:28.540 --> 00:14:33.010
I wanted to discuss him the way I was disgusted to scare him away,

240
00:14:33.340 --> 00:14:37.390
to show him who we were so that he might leave now rather than wait.

241
00:14:37.900 --> 00:14:42.160
And here's more.
I said in my sweetest voice,
yes,
he said,

242
00:14:42.220 --> 00:14:45.160
I see he made no motion to rise and run.

243
00:14:45.370 --> 00:14:49.180
He sat glancing at the pages and then looking away as if distracted.

244
00:14:49.540 --> 00:14:51.680
When my mother came out of the bathroom and saw us,

245
00:14:51.681 --> 00:14:55.730
she snatched the album from my hands and stuck it back in its place on the
shelf,

246
00:14:56.030 --> 00:14:57.470
giving me a furious look.

247
00:14:58.490 --> 00:15:03.020
So I think one of the things also that I'm trying to do with this book is to get

248
00:15:03.021 --> 00:15:07.190
so particular about my life that in some ways it gets universal so that people,

249
00:15:07.191 --> 00:15:09.980
I think that the Steve Jobs thing can be quite distracting and people think,

250
00:15:09.981 --> 00:15:12.830
oh my life must be so different.
But then when they read it,

251
00:15:13.130 --> 00:15:15.290
it's not so different.
Everyone has,

252
00:15:15.590 --> 00:15:19.640
usually people have complicated people that they love and they have,

253
00:15:19.970 --> 00:15:23.810
um,
sort of bumps in the road of coming of age.

254
00:15:24.230 --> 00:15:29.230
And I think in some ways the contrasts are quite high in this book in my story.

255
00:15:30.680 --> 00:15:34.980
But the more I hear from other people and the more I,
you know,
and,
and,

256
00:15:35.070 --> 00:15:38.090
and because I know people and have friends and love people,

257
00:15:38.091 --> 00:15:43.091
I know that people also have stories like this even if they don't have the same

258
00:15:43.131 --> 00:15:45.590
degree of notoriety I guess.

259
00:15:45.740 --> 00:15:50.030
But I had to have use people in my life that I loved to stand in for other

260
00:15:50.031 --> 00:15:53.810
things.
And I was doing a reading,
actually at my old high school.

261
00:15:54.650 --> 00:15:57.680
Everyone who is in this memoir was there.
It was kind of terrifying.

262
00:15:58.130 --> 00:16:00.380
And including my ex boyfriend,

263
00:16:00.381 --> 00:16:04.970
my high school boyfriend who I wrote some things about him.

264
00:16:04.970 --> 00:16:08.270
And I think,
um,
you know,

265
00:16:08.271 --> 00:16:10.940
he's certainly a more interesting person than on these pages and these pages.

266
00:16:10.941 --> 00:16:13.340
He's kind of like in relation to me.
Um,

267
00:16:13.850 --> 00:16:17.840
but what I was thinking about his character in the book is that he kind of

268
00:16:17.841 --> 00:16:21.890
stands for,
he stands for California.
Um,

269
00:16:22.490 --> 00:16:26.570
falling in love with him is a way of explaining the bay area where I grew up.

270
00:16:27.260 --> 00:16:28.970
And I'm sure lots of you,
I guess,

271
00:16:29.150 --> 00:16:33.200
I imagine lots of you have been to the bay area,
um,

272
00:16:33.230 --> 00:16:36.530
because Google and I'm actually,

273
00:16:36.560 --> 00:16:40.460
I guess Google started in the garage of my journalism teacher.
Um,

274
00:16:41.060 --> 00:16:43.310
so,
um,
and she,

275
00:16:43.370 --> 00:16:46.940
she ran the paper and my high school and it hadn't started yet.

276
00:16:47.000 --> 00:16:49.760
It was a twinkle in someone's eye I guess.
Um,

277
00:16:50.200 --> 00:16:54.950
but it was just about to start in these pages,
although I didn't know.
But anyway,

278
00:16:54.951 --> 00:16:59.720
this isn't a story about Google.
This is a story about me.
So I,
um,

279
00:17:01.340 --> 00:17:04.790
so this is the story of,
of high school and the bay area.

280
00:17:04.850 --> 00:17:09.850
And I was writing this book from the cold wilds of Brooklyn and imagining

281
00:17:11.481 --> 00:17:16.481
sunshine and imagining air that had perfume in it of Eucalyptus and Bay Laurel

282
00:17:17.961 --> 00:17:19.040
and you know,

283
00:17:19.070 --> 00:17:24.070
the grass is on the hills and it was a nice place to live for a long time.

284
00:17:24.320 --> 00:17:28.000
Now I'm going to have to actually go back to Brooklyn and live in Brooklyn.
Um,

285
00:17:28.850 --> 00:17:30.470
but it was a nice way to time travel,

286
00:17:30.530 --> 00:17:35.390
spend time with my young parents and sort of travel through space and be in the

287
00:17:35.391 --> 00:17:37.010
bay area again,
which is so beautiful.

288
00:17:37.190 --> 00:17:40.520
On the way home from another visit to my school to the school,

289
00:17:40.760 --> 00:17:44.420
my father suggested that we stop at Palo Alto high school pally for short,

290
00:17:44.690 --> 00:17:45.950
just to see what it was like.

291
00:17:46.550 --> 00:17:49.620
It was late in the afternoon and school was out for few minutes.

292
00:17:49.621 --> 00:17:53.490
We walked around the empty quad.
Many of the buildings look like bunkers.

293
00:17:53.520 --> 00:17:55.920
I felt uncomfortable as if we were trespassing,

294
00:17:56.340 --> 00:17:59.970
but then we heard music coming from somewhere and we followed it over to where a

295
00:17:59.971 --> 00:18:03.480
tall boy was standing beside the door where the music was coming from.

296
00:18:03.930 --> 00:18:07.980
I was too shy to speak,
but my father asked,
what's going on in here?

297
00:18:08.400 --> 00:18:11.730
And the boy said it's the paper.
And we peered into the room.

298
00:18:12.780 --> 00:18:16.300
There were lots of people inside working on computers and lounging on beanbags

299
00:18:16.350 --> 00:18:20.910
and I thought if I did decide to go here,
I'd work on the paper too.

300
00:18:21.510 --> 00:18:23.970
You know what's great about going to school nearby your house?

301
00:18:24.030 --> 00:18:25.440
My father asked as we left.

302
00:18:25.740 --> 00:18:30.270
You can walk to it like I did and if you walk a lot over the course of time,

303
00:18:30.600 --> 00:18:34.770
you get to see the seasons change.
He said it in the same slow way.

304
00:18:34.771 --> 00:18:36.240
He spoke of beautiful women,

305
00:18:36.630 --> 00:18:41.040
but walking to school didn't sound very romantic to me.
Nonetheless,

306
00:18:41.550 --> 00:18:44.670
I go to the school and now I'm in my senior year.

307
00:18:45.810 --> 00:18:47.220
In my senior year at Pally,

308
00:18:47.250 --> 00:18:50.340
I was elected to the position of editor and chief of the paper.

309
00:18:51.570 --> 00:18:54.780
One day in the middle of the week,
there were technical problems.

310
00:18:55.080 --> 00:18:58.230
The computer systems crashed.
The screens went dark.

311
00:18:58.500 --> 00:19:00.240
The printer became inaccessible.

312
00:19:00.690 --> 00:19:03.390
If the computer is no longer operated and when not reboot,

313
00:19:03.391 --> 00:19:07.500
days of work would be lost.
All our carefully designed pages,

314
00:19:08.160 --> 00:19:11.280
Josh,
his dirty blonde hair,
the color of a Sand Dune,

315
00:19:11.520 --> 00:19:15.930
Warren in a thick ponytail laid down on the floor to inspect and arrange the

316
00:19:15.931 --> 00:19:20.100
wires.
The rest of us mold in a daze of terror and tragedy.

317
00:19:20.730 --> 00:19:24.930
Do you want to come?
He asked me about a trip to his house to get a missing cord.

318
00:19:25.350 --> 00:19:30.350
I noticed Josh more closely now dimples when he smiled wide shoulders beneath

319
00:19:30.871 --> 00:19:31.830
flannel shirts.

320
00:19:32.250 --> 00:19:37.250
He was shy and friendly and had loose complicated handwriting like the bouncing

321
00:19:37.591 --> 00:19:39.870
string of a kite.
Sure.

322
00:19:39.871 --> 00:19:44.760
I said not knowing then that he lived in Portola Valley 20 minutes away.

323
00:19:45.450 --> 00:19:50.190
He seemed to me sloppy,
too relaxed shambolic he could fix computers,

324
00:19:50.370 --> 00:19:53.820
but he was disorganized for getting to do his assignments for Mrs. Pause English

325
00:19:53.821 --> 00:19:56.940
class.
Whereas I was meticulous.
Greg Grade Grubber,

326
00:19:57.600 --> 00:20:01.200
he never arrived anywhere on time and he was hopeless with a calendar,

327
00:20:01.440 --> 00:20:04.770
wouldn't have his homework and scramble to do it in the minutes before class.

328
00:20:04.830 --> 00:20:08.940
Later I would find out that he was taking applied mathematics and differential

329
00:20:08.941 --> 00:20:13.140
equations at Stanford and he would be admitted to college at Stanford and Mit,

330
00:20:13.170 --> 00:20:14.280
so he was clearly fine.

331
00:20:15.330 --> 00:20:20.310
He drove a used 83 Toyota supra and incandescent teal with a pink sign wave

332
00:20:20.311 --> 00:20:24.540
painted along both sides.
Sorry about the paint job.
He said as we got in,

333
00:20:24.960 --> 00:20:27.840
he bought it used from a female physicist in Livermore.

334
00:20:28.080 --> 00:20:30.150
He had nice hands on the steering wheel.

335
00:20:30.630 --> 00:20:34.560
His room had a mattress on the floor and a window looking out to a yard and the

336
00:20:34.561 --> 00:20:37.740
forest.
There were papers and books strewn around,

337
00:20:38.010 --> 00:20:40.500
a stack of stereo equipment and headphones.

338
00:20:40.890 --> 00:20:44.100
It was large enough to seem empty and cluttered at the same time.

339
00:20:44.430 --> 00:20:49.030
He found the cord and we left.
On the way back,
we turned onto Arastradero,

340
00:20:49.270 --> 00:20:53.440
a two lane road rough and patched.
That wound beside a nature preserve.

341
00:20:54.010 --> 00:20:56.590
I'm going to show you a secret.
He said,
hold on.

342
00:20:57.340 --> 00:21:00.610
The speed limit was 25 he began to accelerate.

343
00:21:00.940 --> 00:21:04.660
We advance toward a blind corner where the road rose up and then disappeared a

344
00:21:04.661 --> 00:21:06.760
hill on one side,
drop on the other.

345
00:21:07.150 --> 00:21:10.240
The road curled back on itself around the hill,
out of sight.

346
00:21:10.690 --> 00:21:14.890
Another car might be advancing toward us and smash into us at the bend.

347
00:21:15.340 --> 00:21:19.570
A family of deer might be walking across.
He continued to build speed.

348
00:21:19.571 --> 00:21:24.190
Shifting up.
Third,
fourth,
fifth.
The car rumbled and wind.

349
00:21:24.580 --> 00:21:28.840
Are you sure you should be?
Don't worry.
He yelled.
I've done it before.

350
00:21:29.230 --> 00:21:33.910
My mother sometimes said,
there are guardian angels just for teenagers.

351
00:21:34.480 --> 00:21:38.980
Oh,
help me,
God of teenagers.
I thought,
Oh God of teenagers.

352
00:21:39.430 --> 00:21:43.750
Hold on.
He yelled,
the car scraped.
The gear is saying,

353
00:21:44.560 --> 00:21:47.980
I grip the top of the seat belt in one hand,
the door handle and the other.

354
00:21:47.981 --> 00:21:52.600
He shifted again,
peeled around the bright blind curve and then we flew.

355
00:21:53.470 --> 00:21:55.390
It was because of the uneven road,

356
00:21:55.630 --> 00:21:58.810
a raised portion followed by a long dip downhill.

357
00:21:59.290 --> 00:22:00.730
If you got up enough speed,

358
00:22:00.850 --> 00:22:05.050
you could catch the lip of the up and fly over the concavity through the dots of

359
00:22:05.051 --> 00:22:10.000
light cast by the row of emerald trees and bushes growing alongside the road for

360
00:22:10.001 --> 00:22:11.800
me,
the flight unleaded,

361
00:22:11.801 --> 00:22:16.360
the town there were hidden places of freedom and he knew them and then we're

362
00:22:16.361 --> 00:22:21.100
dating
sometimes in the late afternoon after school.

363
00:22:21.100 --> 00:22:23.620
During the weeks when we were not producing the newspaper.

364
00:22:23.830 --> 00:22:27.250
Josh and I went to Windy Hill preserve up above skyline hills,

365
00:22:27.251 --> 00:22:31.960
white and yellow and soft like the humps of camels on one side more hills like a

366
00:22:31.961 --> 00:22:35.050
blanket thrown out into the wind all the way that the Pacific Ocean,

367
00:22:35.980 --> 00:22:40.540
the town was a miniature below us silent and still except for the singing

368
00:22:40.541 --> 00:22:44.950
rasping wind that flattened the tall grasses,
a clear day,

369
00:22:45.280 --> 00:22:49.780
too much to take in the glassy era and the feeling of great freedom and grace.

370
00:22:50.050 --> 00:22:51.160
The world opening.

371
00:22:51.550 --> 00:22:54.760
I look north and I could see San Francisco sparkling in the distance.

372
00:22:55.180 --> 00:22:57.310
It was both close and far away.

373
00:22:57.520 --> 00:23:00.580
Something to do with the angle of this hill to those hills,

374
00:23:00.880 --> 00:23:02.290
the refraction of the light.

375
00:23:03.070 --> 00:23:06.010
That's how I felt about my parents now that Josh was around,

376
00:23:06.370 --> 00:23:10.840
not that I didn't worry about my mom or my father or what would happen when he

377
00:23:10.841 --> 00:23:13.180
realized that I was really leaving for college,

378
00:23:13.450 --> 00:23:17.440
I was simply hovering above it all so it didn't pinch or press.

379
00:23:17.860 --> 00:23:21.880
Now Josh was the one who drove me to doctor's appointments or between houses.

380
00:23:22.450 --> 00:23:23.980
He did not keep a calendar,

381
00:23:24.220 --> 00:23:27.160
forgot about work assignments and Miss Dentist's appointments and other

382
00:23:27.161 --> 00:23:29.650
appointments,
but never the ones with me.

383
00:23:30.340 --> 00:23:35.340
I was protected in tight inside his tail supra after the spring rains when the

384
00:23:36.251 --> 00:23:39.670
grasses came up out of the clause of dirt under the oak and eucalyptus trees

385
00:23:39.671 --> 00:23:44.230
around Stanford for Radian fas like whiskers,
stripes of gold,

386
00:23:44.231 --> 00:23:48.740
light in long ribbons.
I thought,
this is my town.

387
00:23:49.520 --> 00:23:53.270
I walked home afterschool and notice the seasons change.

388
00:23:53.930 --> 00:23:54.711
Before this.

389
00:23:54.711 --> 00:23:59.180
It was my father's town or my mother's town or the town where I had been placed

390
00:23:59.181 --> 00:24:01.070
by accident and shifted around.

391
00:24:01.610 --> 00:24:06.290
Now I was in love and the land was dimensional and heavy and particulate.

392
00:24:06.500 --> 00:24:08.900
It belonged to me.
Thank you.

393
00:24:10.040 --> 00:24:12.790
<v 0>[inaudible]</v>

394
00:24:13.600 --> 00:24:16.360
<v 1>thanks.
That was awesome.
Thank you for the readings that they were really great.</v>

395
00:24:16.660 --> 00:24:18.820
Um,
when you think about your dad,
how would you describe him?

396
00:24:21.150 --> 00:24:25.560
It's hard to sum it up so quickly.
Very human.

397
00:24:25.710 --> 00:24:29.400
I would say.
It was interesting.
I mean I was talking about time traveling.

398
00:24:29.910 --> 00:24:32.580
One thing you get to do when you're writing a memoir is you get to go and hang

399
00:24:32.581 --> 00:24:33.600
out.
At least I did.

400
00:24:33.601 --> 00:24:37.020
You get to go and hang out with your parents when they're younger than you are

401
00:24:37.021 --> 00:24:38.940
now.
Um,

402
00:24:40.230 --> 00:24:43.320
so you get to notice that they're human.

403
00:24:44.280 --> 00:24:46.410
And one thing that I noticed was that,

404
00:24:47.030 --> 00:24:49.590
so my father wasn't really around when I was very little.

405
00:24:50.750 --> 00:24:51.583
<v 0>MMM.</v>

406
00:24:52.980 --> 00:24:57.240
<v 1>I was unexpected,
unwanted.
Um,</v>

407
00:24:57.300 --> 00:25:01.030
and my parents were both so young and um,

408
00:25:01.560 --> 00:25:05.790
his career trajectory was just just beginning then and really starting to ramp

409
00:25:05.791 --> 00:25:08.890
up as far as I understand.
So,
um,

410
00:25:09.000 --> 00:25:13.920
he wasn't around and then at a certain point he must've made a pretty clear

411
00:25:13.921 --> 00:25:17.460
decision to come back and be a part of my life.

412
00:25:18.780 --> 00:25:22.950
And I think for me at the time,
and you will see in the book,

413
00:25:23.730 --> 00:25:27.060
um,
it was very awkward.

414
00:25:27.570 --> 00:25:28.770
We wanted to get to know each other,

415
00:25:28.771 --> 00:25:31.800
but I think he was very young and didn't really know how to be with kids.

416
00:25:32.310 --> 00:25:35.640
And I had been dreaming of him for so long that it was like I wanted him to

417
00:25:35.641 --> 00:25:40.641
arrive on the scene where the real Bam and he was in some ways the dream father

418
00:25:43.770 --> 00:25:47.980
in a sense of being the father.
You dream about when you don't have one?
Um,

419
00:25:48.030 --> 00:25:53.030
he was a famous and he was rich and he was incredibly charismatic and he was

420
00:25:53.851 --> 00:25:55.650
handsome and he drove a Porsche.

421
00:25:56.070 --> 00:26:00.090
And so it was kind of like this realer than real,

422
00:26:00.091 --> 00:26:02.250
larger than life arrival.

423
00:26:02.790 --> 00:26:06.930
But in another way it was disappointing because he was so awkward.

424
00:26:06.960 --> 00:26:09.510
There were these long pauses.
And,
um,

425
00:26:10.320 --> 00:26:14.700
I went back as a part of this book and watched this next presentation.

426
00:26:14.990 --> 00:26:16.860
Um,
it was the introduction to the next,

427
00:26:16.861 --> 00:26:19.380
I think at Davies Symphony Hall in San Francisco.

428
00:26:19.770 --> 00:26:24.290
And I had already written about it,
but,
um,
but I wanted,

429
00:26:24.480 --> 00:26:28.420
I wanted to watch the presentation because I want it to make sure that what I'd

430
00:26:28.430 --> 00:26:30.810
remembered was correct.
And,
um,

431
00:26:30.870 --> 00:26:34.920
I'm not really a Steve jobs completionist so I don't really watch his old

432
00:26:34.921 --> 00:26:38.010
presentations.
Um,
I was there at some of them and the other ones,
you know,

433
00:26:38.040 --> 00:26:40.990
he was my father or not this figure.
Um,

434
00:26:41.070 --> 00:26:43.020
but I got myself to watch the presentation.

435
00:26:43.140 --> 00:26:46.980
I'd remembered looking at him from the perspective of a daughter and him being

436
00:26:46.981 --> 00:26:48.570
kind of amazing and larger than life.

437
00:26:48.571 --> 00:26:53.070
And then when I watched the presentation again on Youtube,
he was incredible.

438
00:26:53.130 --> 00:26:55.080
I was like,
oh wow.
He really was incredible.

439
00:26:55.081 --> 00:26:58.800
This wasn't just the perspective of a daughter.
Um,

440
00:26:58.860 --> 00:27:03.840
he seemed so at ease in front of so many people.
And so,

441
00:27:04.210 --> 00:27:09.040
um,
so I guess this just kind of a terrible word,

442
00:27:09.041 --> 00:27:09.970
but so relatable,

443
00:27:10.000 --> 00:27:15.000
so simple and human at the same time as being so sparkling and incredible and

444
00:27:19.160 --> 00:27:21.920
so set against our personal interactions.

445
00:27:21.921 --> 00:27:26.180
When we were getting to know each other,
we were,
um,
you know,

446
00:27:26.181 --> 00:27:29.750
the first time I was going to stay at his house overnight because my mother was

447
00:27:29.751 --> 00:27:33.280
taking a class and I went to his company and waited for him for a while.

448
00:27:33.300 --> 00:27:35.130
Then we got in his car,
um,

449
00:27:35.150 --> 00:27:39.620
and his amazing Porsche and drove to his mansion and the whole drive,

450
00:27:39.621 --> 00:27:44.090
he didn't say a word.
So,
and at the time I thought,
you know,

451
00:27:44.091 --> 00:27:47.870
maybe it was something I did or maybe,
um,

452
00:27:48.020 --> 00:27:51.320
if I had been more of a conversationalist or maybe he was mad at me and I

453
00:27:51.321 --> 00:27:56.321
realize looking back as an adult spending time with this young awkward man that

454
00:27:57.201 --> 00:28:01.850
he actually just was kind of doing his best and he was quite human.

455
00:28:02.360 --> 00:28:03.530
So,
um,

456
00:28:04.460 --> 00:28:08.480
it was wonderful to have certain revelations like that to let myself,

457
00:28:08.510 --> 00:28:11.720
to give myself the permission to understand,
um,

458
00:28:12.200 --> 00:28:15.350
who he might've been as a father and a person and where he might've been coming

459
00:28:15.351 --> 00:28:18.470
from,
um,
as,
uh,

460
00:28:18.500 --> 00:28:21.710
complicated and incomplete person as we all are.

461
00:28:23.690 --> 00:28:26.120
I hope that answers your question again.
I don't,
I,

462
00:28:26.121 --> 00:28:28.820
I'm the last person to talk about his work life,
right?

463
00:28:29.090 --> 00:28:31.730
So I feel like when you look back at your childhood,

464
00:28:32.030 --> 00:28:35.000
a lot of people have patchy memories or may have remembered something

465
00:28:35.001 --> 00:28:38.470
incorrectly that then somebody tells you the story later,

466
00:28:38.490 --> 00:28:39.950
an older adult that may have been there.

467
00:28:40.160 --> 00:28:43.250
So I'm wondering if you had more of those revelations as you were writing about

468
00:28:43.251 --> 00:28:46.940
them,
things that you thought happened a certain way and then as you started to

469
00:28:46.941 --> 00:28:50.180
describe him,
you realize actually that's not at all what happened.

470
00:28:50.210 --> 00:28:53.060
Did you have moments like that and what was one that was interesting?

471
00:28:53.660 --> 00:28:55.910
I'm sure I did have moments like that.
Um,

472
00:28:56.450 --> 00:29:01.450
so what happens is it's really hard to remember so many things from your life.

473
00:29:01.911 --> 00:29:06.911
And I wasn't sure at the beginning I had enough memory to write a whole book

474
00:29:08.990 --> 00:29:11.210
about my childhood.
It's a coming of age book,

475
00:29:11.211 --> 00:29:15.410
so it ends when I leave for college and I was terrified.

476
00:29:15.440 --> 00:29:20.440
But it turns out when you start to sit down and think and work at it and write

477
00:29:22.550 --> 00:29:25.640
something about writing also helps you get one story.

478
00:29:25.641 --> 00:29:28.220
And then another one connects to that story and then another one connects.

479
00:29:28.460 --> 00:29:31.070
And after a while you have a whole constellation of stories.

480
00:29:31.071 --> 00:29:35.510
And if you kind of pull this end,
this end kind of trembles.

481
00:29:35.511 --> 00:29:39.620
So that I wrote,
I probably wrote seven books for this book.
Um,

482
00:29:39.890 --> 00:29:44.260
stories that helped me get to a place,
but that in the end weren't necessary,

483
00:29:44.290 --> 00:29:46.990
didn't merit inclusion.
And I'm looking for the,

484
00:29:47.200 --> 00:29:51.760
I'm looking for the stories in my life that stand for several things.

485
00:29:52.270 --> 00:29:56.980
Um,
maybe stories that are,
that are,
are kind of metaphors as well.

486
00:29:56.981 --> 00:29:59.950
And there was one to hide.
My father used to always say,
lease,

487
00:30:00.040 --> 00:30:04.100
you're going to remember this.
Um,
and I thought,
what am I,
the record keeper.
Um,

488
00:30:04.110 --> 00:30:05.860
but also I thought,
Oh God,
I hope I remember what,

489
00:30:05.870 --> 00:30:07.720
why would I remember this particular moment?

490
00:30:07.721 --> 00:30:11.620
Because some of the moments were very poignant perhaps for him and they weren't

491
00:30:11.621 --> 00:30:15.190
for me.
And so I didn't quite understand what was going on.

492
00:30:15.191 --> 00:30:18.760
And there was one moment when we were on a vacation in Hawaii,

493
00:30:18.761 --> 00:30:21.820
I think I was maybe nine,
and he'd been,

494
00:30:23.140 --> 00:30:25.180
especially when I looked at this book and researched it,

495
00:30:25.181 --> 00:30:28.750
I understood he'd been wavering back and forth about his paternity.

496
00:30:28.900 --> 00:30:31.150
It had been proven by a DNA test,

497
00:30:31.151 --> 00:30:36.151
but he's still was saying he wasn't my father in public and to other people and

498
00:30:36.281 --> 00:30:37.840
private.
Um,

499
00:30:38.140 --> 00:30:42.460
but there was this moment when we were in Hawaii and I do remember him sort of

500
00:30:42.461 --> 00:30:44.290
pointing out body parts and saying,
look,

501
00:30:44.291 --> 00:30:47.860
we have the same this and we have the same this.
And I remember his,
his,

502
00:30:47.920 --> 00:30:51.370
he wanted to sort of sit there for a while and his arm around my waist kind of

503
00:30:51.371 --> 00:30:54.880
felt like a seat seatbelt because I wanted to run and leap and jump to the

504
00:30:54.881 --> 00:30:59.740
desserts table.
And I thought,
why is he keeping me this heaviness?
Um,

505
00:31:00.100 --> 00:31:02.410
and I talked with his ex girlfriend Tina,

506
00:31:02.830 --> 00:31:06.730
and she remembered that time too with a little more clarity.

507
00:31:07.030 --> 00:31:10.990
And she also was telling me that he was even saying to her that he wasn't

508
00:31:10.991 --> 00:31:15.100
necessarily my father and it was at that moment because she was there too,

509
00:31:15.700 --> 00:31:19.660
that she saw that he was kind of claiming me.

510
00:31:20.380 --> 00:31:24.790
And so I had remembered some part of that moment,
um,

511
00:31:25.090 --> 00:31:26.800
from my child's perspective.

512
00:31:27.310 --> 00:31:32.310
But the full import of that scene was not apparent until I went back and did

513
00:31:33.881 --> 00:31:37.090
some research and understood kind of what was really going on.

514
00:31:37.420 --> 00:31:42.420
And it was wonderful to be able to layer my childhood memories and feelings and

515
00:31:43.631 --> 00:31:48.631
desires and longings with the woman that I am now who knows so much more about

516
00:31:49.300 --> 00:31:53.860
people and who can understand more of what's going on.
Um,

517
00:31:54.430 --> 00:31:58.420
it was like I could sort of keep my child self company.
Um,

518
00:31:58.720 --> 00:32:01.450
so the times,
you know,
I don't know if it happens for you guys,

519
00:32:01.451 --> 00:32:05.500
but like sometimes things happen,
New York kid and you don't know what they mean.

520
00:32:05.501 --> 00:32:10.180
And so it's those things that you keep and preserve and bring forward into your

521
00:32:10.181 --> 00:32:11.860
adulthood.
Um,

522
00:32:12.250 --> 00:32:16.630
maybe because you hope at some point you'll have the information and the wisdom

523
00:32:16.631 --> 00:32:21.631
and the knowledge to be able to sort of open up those mysteries and make sense

524
00:32:21.761 --> 00:32:22.594
of them later.

525
00:32:23.020 --> 00:32:27.100
And so the process of writing really was a process of opening up all these long

526
00:32:27.101 --> 00:32:31.810
closed boxes and seeing what was inside and sometimes what was inside was kind

527
00:32:31.811 --> 00:32:33.940
of running the run of the mill story.

528
00:32:34.210 --> 00:32:39.010
And sometimes what was inside was more than I had anticipated.

529
00:32:39.590 --> 00:32:43.970
Um,
and changed my own perspective of my past.

530
00:32:43.971 --> 00:32:48.310
And I guess I do hope to do that for other people reading the book.
Um,

531
00:32:48.350 --> 00:32:53.230
also I hope to maybe,
um,

532
00:32:54.020 --> 00:32:59.020
change other people's perspective or deepen their own awareness or their

533
00:32:59.301 --> 00:33:01.220
memories of their own past.

534
00:33:01.221 --> 00:33:03.830
I think it's definitely happened for people who grew up in California because,

535
00:33:04.440 --> 00:33:08.270
um,
they're like the smells,
you know,
cause I have so many smells in this book,

536
00:33:08.271 --> 00:33:12.980
maybe too many smells.
Um,
but I think childhood also has,

537
00:33:13.490 --> 00:33:17.720
um,
a lot of these mysteries in it.
There's like a,

538
00:33:18.680 --> 00:33:19.880
there's a thing you do as a kid,

539
00:33:19.881 --> 00:33:24.290
I guess you use anything you've got because you don't really have much.
Um,

540
00:33:24.560 --> 00:33:28.970
so remembering all the times I kind of subtly and not so subtly kind of tried to

541
00:33:28.971 --> 00:33:32.990
use my father's fame to prop myself up.
How embarrassing is that?

542
00:33:33.560 --> 00:33:35.810
Um,
and then,
you know,

543
00:33:35.811 --> 00:33:38.870
trying to forgive that young person for or,

544
00:33:39.530 --> 00:33:42.890
or be able to chuckle at the young person for doing whatever she could do and

545
00:33:42.891 --> 00:33:45.090
being scrappy.
Yes.

546
00:33:46.460 --> 00:33:49.780
<v 2>So another funny connection,
your journalism teacher,</v>

547
00:33:49.810 --> 00:33:52.140
I believe as turbo Chesky who's a,

548
00:33:52.150 --> 00:33:56.550
one of his daughters is a youtube CEO.
Another daughter was,

549
00:33:56.560 --> 00:33:58.840
was married to Sergey Brin,
I think,
you know,
for a little while.

550
00:33:59.770 --> 00:34:03.310
To what extent were these connections to the rest of Silicon Valley,

551
00:34:03.370 --> 00:34:04.840
that connectedness part of your life?

552
00:34:05.590 --> 00:34:07.390
<v 1>Google was beginning in her garage.</v>

553
00:34:07.420 --> 00:34:11.080
I think around the time I was graduating or maybe just about when I went to

554
00:34:11.081 --> 00:34:13.750
college and I had just about no idea.

555
00:34:13.960 --> 00:34:18.820
So amazing things can be happening around you and you can not know about them

556
00:34:19.420 --> 00:34:23.940
even if even if you're right in the epicenter of them.
Um,
or maybe I'm,
you know,

557
00:34:23.980 --> 00:34:27.640
I don't think anyone particularly new.
Um,
so yes,

558
00:34:27.641 --> 00:34:29.050
that was watch and I had an event,

559
00:34:29.051 --> 00:34:32.830
I was saying I had an event at my high school with watch the other day and

560
00:34:33.310 --> 00:34:36.220
everyone,
almost everyone in the memoir was there,

561
00:34:36.880 --> 00:34:40.060
which I can tell you is kind of terrifying.
Um,

562
00:34:40.360 --> 00:34:43.860
but I'm relating to my story as,
um,

563
00:34:44.980 --> 00:34:49.060
the story of a girl with a father and a mother growing up in California at that

564
00:34:49.061 --> 00:34:50.460
time.
Um,

565
00:34:50.560 --> 00:34:54.700
not as the story of a titan.

566
00:34:54.701 --> 00:34:57.700
Nora have a,
um,
silicon valley guru.

567
00:34:57.790 --> 00:35:02.410
I get to talk about how silicon valley was,
um,
because I lived it,

568
00:35:02.950 --> 00:35:04.480
but,
um,

569
00:35:05.860 --> 00:35:08.680
I certainly was not a part of the business aspect,

570
00:35:08.740 --> 00:35:10.360
I guess that's interesting in its own way.

571
00:35:10.810 --> 00:35:14.960
I remember coming back in college and um,

572
00:35:15.490 --> 00:35:17.800
that was during the first.com boom.

573
00:35:17.920 --> 00:35:21.970
I think and noticing that like every other car was a Ferrari and there were lots

574
00:35:21.971 --> 00:35:25.720
of high heels and I'd never seen high yields in Palo Alto before that.

575
00:35:26.020 --> 00:35:28.890
So I was like,
wow,
what's happened to my place?
And even,

576
00:35:28.891 --> 00:35:33.430
and now going back of course it's vastly different.
Um,
but this is,

577
00:35:33.550 --> 00:35:34.383
um,

578
00:35:35.710 --> 00:35:40.170
I think this is more of a story everyone can relate with even though it has,
um,

579
00:35:40.590 --> 00:35:43.620
dramatic ups and downs.
Yes.

580
00:35:44.520 --> 00:35:49.520
<v 3>You've talked about how you looked at your father and you are trying to kind of</v>

581
00:35:50.880 --> 00:35:55.410
from the outside learn how he was feeling about being your father.

582
00:35:55.590 --> 00:35:58.920
Like the thing with the arm and I was wondering if you've ever actually had an

583
00:35:58.921 --> 00:36:00.810
open conversation with him about this.

584
00:36:00.870 --> 00:36:04.890
If you ever asked him why it was so difficult for him to accept that he is your

585
00:36:04.891 --> 00:36:05.724
father?

586
00:36:06.770 --> 00:36:08.420
<v 1>That's a good question.
Um,</v>

587
00:36:10.910 --> 00:36:12.980
it was hard to talk with him about things like that.

588
00:36:13.010 --> 00:36:17.450
He said that he wasn't so good at communicating and,
um,

589
00:36:18.080 --> 00:36:21.410
there was a kind of wonderful moment,
the end of the book,

590
00:36:21.490 --> 00:36:23.180
I had been waiting for this Hollywood moment.

591
00:36:23.190 --> 00:36:27.260
He was so sick and I'm waiting for some sort of moment of reconciliation.

592
00:36:27.980 --> 00:36:28.813
Um,

593
00:36:29.510 --> 00:36:33.080
and of course I knew I was an idiot because when do you get those moments that

594
00:36:33.081 --> 00:36:35.450
are in the movies,
right?
When the person says,
I'm sorry,

595
00:36:35.451 --> 00:36:39.620
or I understand how you felt,
or,
but still I was waiting for it.

596
00:36:39.621 --> 00:36:42.680
So I kept on returning home and I think that's why I was sort of pilfering these

597
00:36:42.681 --> 00:36:47.390
objects,
um,
because I felt things weren't complete.

598
00:36:48.050 --> 00:36:48.883
Um,

599
00:36:50.420 --> 00:36:53.510
but I couldn't really get that conversation out of him.

600
00:36:53.511 --> 00:36:57.200
And I was terrified when,
when we had talked about it earlier,

601
00:36:57.201 --> 00:37:01.460
he had said things like,
you know,
just move on or,
you know,

602
00:37:01.880 --> 00:37:06.660
um,
he said at some point he was sorry,
and he said he loved me.
Um,

603
00:37:06.860 --> 00:37:09.410
but it somehow wasn't enough for this,

604
00:37:09.620 --> 00:37:13.310
what felt like a kind of tidal wave of grief actually,
um,

605
00:37:14.090 --> 00:37:18.740
that we'd miss each other for so long.
So when he was dying,
he,
um,

606
00:37:18.830 --> 00:37:23.240
I went back a month before and finally we had a kind of amazing moment where he

607
00:37:23.241 --> 00:37:26.510
said,
I really owe you one over and over again,
and it's such an odd phrase.

608
00:37:26.511 --> 00:37:31.210
I owe you one.
Um,
he hadn't really said it before and Kevin,

609
00:37:31.211 --> 00:37:33.390
I'm wondering what is the one?
Um,

610
00:37:33.740 --> 00:37:37.320
and he was also sad because,
um,

611
00:37:37.940 --> 00:37:41.990
he hadn't really spent the time,
he said,
and the problem with dying is,

612
00:37:41.991 --> 00:37:43.640
I guess it's a kind of like a final end.

613
00:37:44.120 --> 00:37:48.310
So if you haven't spent the time before that happens,
then,
um,

614
00:37:48.890 --> 00:37:53.510
then it's too late,
you know?
Um,
so,
so that,

615
00:37:53.570 --> 00:37:56.030
that felt very meaningful.
Like,
okay,
we're on the same page.

616
00:37:56.030 --> 00:37:58.340
We missed something here.
Uh,

617
00:37:58.580 --> 00:38:02.990
and I wished it had happened earlier because it would have been nice to be

618
00:38:02.991 --> 00:38:03.824
friends.

619
00:38:03.930 --> 00:38:08.240
It would have been nice to have a feeling that he had been sort of unburdened of

620
00:38:08.241 --> 00:38:11.840
this feeling earlier so that we were on the same page because we actually really

621
00:38:11.841 --> 00:38:15.080
liked each other and had some great times together.

622
00:38:16.970 --> 00:38:21.230
He was also really funny and he was enjoyable to be with a lot.

623
00:38:21.260 --> 00:38:26.260
We had a lot of fun on our skates and it felt like it was very lucky in some

624
00:38:26.361 --> 00:38:29.150
ways that I lived with him during high school,
during high school.

625
00:38:29.151 --> 00:38:31.460
Because even though as you will see in the book,

626
00:38:31.461 --> 00:38:35.270
I am full on in the midst of adolescent angst,
um,

627
00:38:36.250 --> 00:38:39.340
I realized if we hadn't lived together then we wouldn't have gotten to know each

628
00:38:39.341 --> 00:38:41.170
other as well as we did.
Um,

629
00:38:41.860 --> 00:38:46.480
and that contains its own kind of resolution because I guess if you know someone

630
00:38:46.510 --> 00:38:48.630
more as a person,
um,

631
00:38:49.220 --> 00:38:54.220
their flaws become more understandable and they perhaps become less personal.

632
00:38:54.310 --> 00:38:56.770
I guess I did feel,
um,

633
00:38:58.180 --> 00:38:59.530
and I write about this in the book,

634
00:39:00.130 --> 00:39:05.130
but I did feel that I've been hearing about sometimes people imitate my father

635
00:39:06.191 --> 00:39:07.930
by imitating his wardrobe or,

636
00:39:08.380 --> 00:39:12.370
or they imitate maybe some of the ways he could be caustic and sharp and

637
00:39:12.371 --> 00:39:16.550
difficult and sometimes cruel.
And,
um,

638
00:39:17.380 --> 00:39:18.610
from my experience,

639
00:39:19.640 --> 00:39:20.630
<v 0>the</v>

640
00:39:21.790 --> 00:39:25.510
<v 1>sensitive that he had had an extremely sensitive part,
um,</v>

641
00:39:26.110 --> 00:39:29.020
very dear,
very kind,
very simple,
very caring.

642
00:39:29.350 --> 00:39:33.100
And it was from that part as far as I could tell by knowing some of his work

643
00:39:33.101 --> 00:39:36.490
colleagues.
And by knowing him to the degree that I did,

644
00:39:36.491 --> 00:39:41.230
it was from that part from which he created.
And so

645
00:39:42.700 --> 00:39:47.050
I wondered if perhaps some of the imitations of the caustic part,

646
00:39:47.870 --> 00:39:48.490
um,

647
00:39:48.490 --> 00:39:53.490
if that part was the part that was protecting this ultra sensitive core.

648
00:39:54.310 --> 00:39:57.160
And so if the imitations in that sense are a bit misguided,

649
00:39:57.510 --> 00:40:00.070
give him that you and your dad didn't,

650
00:40:00.340 --> 00:40:05.340
he didn't fully accept you as his kid until you were a little bit older.

651
00:40:06.670 --> 00:40:10.660
Um,
how did you deal with that reconciliation from your perspective,

652
00:40:10.720 --> 00:40:14.680
both when you were a kid and then as an adult when you had more perspective?

653
00:40:15.370 --> 00:40:19.690
I think this book is going to answer so many of your questions,
um,

654
00:40:19.750 --> 00:40:22.450
but in a subtle way.
So,
um,

655
00:40:24.600 --> 00:40:24.901
I think,

656
00:40:24.901 --> 00:40:28.620
I thought I had gotten over it sort of because we had had a lot of good times

657
00:40:28.621 --> 00:40:32.970
together and he'd apologized and we liked each other and we used to tease each

658
00:40:32.971 --> 00:40:36.690
other.
But then certain funny things kept on happening.

659
00:40:36.691 --> 00:40:41.160
Like I was enraged that he wouldn't get a couch.
We had chairs,

660
00:40:41.161 --> 00:40:43.320
we had places to sit.
Um,

661
00:40:44.760 --> 00:40:48.510
but my mother and I had been sort of nomadic.
We'd been a little bit rootless,

662
00:40:48.511 --> 00:40:51.060
we'd been searching for home,
and so we didn't really have a couch.

663
00:40:51.061 --> 00:40:55.350
We'd sort of stolen,
taken one from him at some point.
And then Carter,

664
00:40:55.351 --> 00:40:57.330
this sort of horrible couch around.

665
00:40:58.680 --> 00:41:02.070
But this feeling that he owed me a couch was so profound.

666
00:41:03.000 --> 00:41:06.870
So I would complain bitterly about the couches and I felt so sad about it.

667
00:41:06.871 --> 00:41:11.370
And so deeply owed and so enraged,
disproportionate to what a couch actually is.

668
00:41:11.940 --> 00:41:16.940
And I think that my sense of grief about having lost him became blame,

669
00:41:17.311 --> 00:41:22.020
became anger and what sort of attached itself to these odd objects.
Um,

670
00:41:22.530 --> 00:41:23.460
so in that sense,

671
00:41:23.461 --> 00:41:28.461
I think it took a while to understand to get under the,

672
00:41:29.850 --> 00:41:32.550
under the skin of my own,
um,

673
00:41:33.770 --> 00:41:38.770
my own sort of strange frustrations and understand that loss might've been at

674
00:41:39.591 --> 00:41:42.830
the root of them,
which was kind of another revelation of writing the book.
Oh,

675
00:41:42.831 --> 00:41:45.530
right.
Why was I so fixated on the couch?
Oh,
right.

676
00:41:45.860 --> 00:41:48.950
Because I hadn't had a father during all that time.

677
00:41:50.060 --> 00:41:52.490
I don't really tell you this in the book,
but I think it,

678
00:41:53.000 --> 00:41:54.260
it becomes kind of clear.

679
00:41:55.850 --> 00:41:56.683
<v 0>MMM.</v>

680
00:41:56.960 --> 00:42:00.070
<v 1>Did you want to ask a question too?
Sure.
My interest I guess is,
uh,</v>

681
00:42:00.740 --> 00:42:04.040
do you have technology and use technology in your life?

682
00:42:04.041 --> 00:42:06.890
Like do you have an iPhone or do you have an android device?

683
00:42:06.891 --> 00:42:09.950
There's lots of folks here that work on,
I'm a competitive product.

684
00:42:09.951 --> 00:42:11.720
I am as a new mom,

685
00:42:11.750 --> 00:42:14.810
do you have a plan for how you're going to deal with technology with your,

686
00:42:14.930 --> 00:42:15.950
with your kids?
First of all,

687
00:42:15.951 --> 00:42:18.530
I have an iPhone and I'm slightly bitter because the new ones seemed to be so

688
00:42:18.531 --> 00:42:22.010
large and I have the smallest hands and so they kind of,
um,

689
00:42:22.720 --> 00:42:27.240
it kind of slips a bit.
Um,
so maybe I need to get an android and solve that.
No,

690
00:42:28.760 --> 00:42:32.870
I can say that.
And I love the camera on the iPhone and I love,

691
00:42:32.960 --> 00:42:35.330
and I wrote my book on an apple and I love it.

692
00:42:35.600 --> 00:42:39.520
But when I was writing it was very difficult to interact with this sort of Insto

693
00:42:39.530 --> 00:42:43.400
texting world while I was doing deeper work.

694
00:42:44.060 --> 00:42:47.990
It would sort of pull me out of,
um,
profound thinking.

695
00:42:48.410 --> 00:42:53.410
So I would leave my phone at a cafe down the street and I was actually dating at

696
00:42:54.351 --> 00:42:57.250
the time,
which made it really made it really difficult to date,
um,

697
00:42:57.290 --> 00:43:01.520
when you don't have a phone.
But I would leave it at a cafe and they would,
um,

698
00:43:02.450 --> 00:43:05.120
they would hold it for me.
And which is so odd,
right?

699
00:43:05.121 --> 00:43:07.820
For sometimes for days at a time,
um,

700
00:43:09.320 --> 00:43:11.750
because sometimes you go to a hard place in your writing and you realize you're

701
00:43:11.751 --> 00:43:12.770
writing really badly.

702
00:43:13.310 --> 00:43:18.020
And it feels like if you look at your phone and you can text with your friends

703
00:43:18.021 --> 00:43:21.590
or,
or you can look at some article that you've sort of solved the problem,

704
00:43:21.591 --> 00:43:24.740
but in fact you've haven't,
you kind of have to sit with the misery,

705
00:43:25.490 --> 00:43:29.270
the misery of your own bad sentences for a while.
They become good.

706
00:43:29.960 --> 00:43:34.160
But they started bad because I didn't know where I was coming from.
So,
um,

707
00:43:35.240 --> 00:43:39.770
so hiding away my phone was very useful and sort of turning off the Internet for

708
00:43:39.771 --> 00:43:40.760
a while was useful.

709
00:43:41.270 --> 00:43:46.270
So the relationship I have with my devices is close but intermittent.

710
00:43:47.990 --> 00:43:49.520
And,
um,

711
00:43:51.630 --> 00:43:54.090
and I've tried when I'm nursing,
um,

712
00:43:54.510 --> 00:43:57.060
and when I'm with my son not to be on the phone,

713
00:43:57.061 --> 00:44:02.061
and me and our babysitter have talked about like trying not to do that so much

714
00:44:02.430 --> 00:44:05.800
when we're with him.
Um,
because it feels as if you're,

715
00:44:05.810 --> 00:44:10.050
you're giving someone concentrated attention,
but of course you're not.
Um,

716
00:44:10.560 --> 00:44:13.710
and I find the easiest solution is to kind of get rid of it for his crying.

717
00:44:14.150 --> 00:44:19.080
And he's like,
I'm sorry,
that's my son.
Uh,
um,

718
00:44:20.610 --> 00:44:24.090
so I'm hoping for future books.

719
00:44:24.091 --> 00:44:28.800
It's not so fraught that I'm able to put my phone in the other room and ignore

720
00:44:28.801 --> 00:44:29.341
it for a while.

721
00:44:29.341 --> 00:44:33.900
But I found with this book I had to either leave it at a cafe or later lock it

722
00:44:33.901 --> 00:44:38.770
in a food addiction,
Xbox,
um,
for a time.
Um,

723
00:44:38.970 --> 00:44:43.290
but you can get on Amazon actually.
Um,
probably other places too.

724
00:44:43.720 --> 00:44:46.500
Um,
but,
uh,

725
00:44:47.520 --> 00:44:51.840
so I wouldn't say love,
hate,
but intermittent and clothes maybe.

726
00:44:52.740 --> 00:44:53.573
Yes.

727
00:44:53.610 --> 00:44:57.180
<v 4>So I was thinking about this,
you and your family,</v>

728
00:44:57.510 --> 00:45:02.510
especially your father had had been portrayed numerous times in like film and

729
00:45:02.641 --> 00:45:06.570
television.
And have you paid attention to any of this?
It must be weird.

730
00:45:06.571 --> 00:45:09.550
Like how do you feel about it?
Just in general thought

731
00:45:09.680 --> 00:45:14.060
<v 1>I sort of assiduously avoid it.
Um,
I haven't,
I have,
I didn't see the,</v>

732
00:45:14.270 --> 00:45:18.620
the Sorkin movie and I,
I didn't read the Isaacson biography and I

733
00:45:21.350 --> 00:45:23.210
don't read the books about my phone.

734
00:45:23.211 --> 00:45:25.880
I figure like there's a scene in peewee's big adventure.

735
00:45:25.881 --> 00:45:29.960
My Dad and I used to watch that and they make a movie about peewee at the end of

736
00:45:29.961 --> 00:45:33.260
his big adventure.
And Dottie,
his friend says,
peewee,

737
00:45:33.261 --> 00:45:35.870
aren't you going to watch your movie?
And he says,
I don't have to.
Dottie,

738
00:45:36.140 --> 00:45:38.300
I lived at,
so something like that.

739
00:45:38.301 --> 00:45:40.780
But also I was working on a book and I thought,
you know,

740
00:45:40.790 --> 00:45:43.880
sometimes you can look at a picture and it informs your own memory.

741
00:45:44.180 --> 00:45:47.180
You stop remembering what you remember and you start remembering the picture.

742
00:45:47.570 --> 00:45:52.570
And I felt it was very important to not interact with um,

743
00:45:53.390 --> 00:45:57.170
other people's interpretations of my father's life with me as a kind of bit

744
00:45:57.171 --> 00:45:58.670
character.
Um,

745
00:45:59.810 --> 00:46:03.980
cause it was our already a courageous act to decide I got to be a main
character.

746
00:46:03.981 --> 00:46:06.650
I mean I think people will sometimes pick up this book thinking that they're

747
00:46:06.651 --> 00:46:11.651
getting a book about Steve Jobs and they will be plunged into the coming of age

748
00:46:11.930 --> 00:46:15.170
Sagas of a girl,
which,
which I think is wonderful.

749
00:46:15.200 --> 00:46:18.200
Maybe it's a book some people wouldn't normally buy.
Um,

750
00:46:18.770 --> 00:46:21.140
but I'm actually finding men are liking it a lot too,

751
00:46:21.170 --> 00:46:24.410
which I was hoping for and which surprises me,
you know,

752
00:46:24.440 --> 00:46:28.940
because it is so specifically about a woman or a girl.
Um,

753
00:46:29.900 --> 00:46:30.201
but yeah,

754
00:46:30.201 --> 00:46:34.580
I kind of don't interact with them and I don't have difficulty avoiding press.

755
00:46:34.581 --> 00:46:36.410
Like even during this book tour,

756
00:46:36.411 --> 00:46:40.130
I've kind of had to keep my equanimity and the way I've done that as a by not

757
00:46:40.131 --> 00:46:42.430
reading any reviews our press.
Um,

758
00:46:42.860 --> 00:46:47.210
so because when I think of it,
I sort of get a pit in my stomach.

759
00:46:47.720 --> 00:46:51.860
Um,
it's hard to be part of another person's narrative,

760
00:46:52.280 --> 00:46:55.940
which is part of the reason I felt like heavy hearted about writing my own

761
00:46:55.941 --> 00:46:58.850
narrative because other people would be a part of it.
Um,

762
00:46:59.450 --> 00:47:02.720
and I've done the best I could with it.
Um,
and I think we do have,

763
00:47:02.840 --> 00:47:04.110
we do have the right to,

764
00:47:04.460 --> 00:47:07.400
to write our own stories or to come to terms with their own stories,

765
00:47:07.520 --> 00:47:10.010
but we don't necessarily have the obligation to,

766
00:47:10.600 --> 00:47:12.440
to participate in the stories of others.

767
00:47:12.780 --> 00:47:17.400
<v 5>I have three daughters and I'm pretty comfortable with like my own passion for</v>

768
00:47:17.401 --> 00:47:21.540
technology.
I don't really share much of that with them.

769
00:47:21.720 --> 00:47:25.080
Um,
so I'm just kind of wondering,
like,

770
00:47:25.950 --> 00:47:30.950
you having a father is very passionate about like what were your common grounds?

771
00:47:32.441 --> 00:47:33.960
Like what,
what,
what,

772
00:47:34.300 --> 00:47:38.170
how did you connect with each other on like,
I mean,

773
00:47:38.171 --> 00:47:41.980
cause we have our things we do because I know they're not interested in all of

774
00:47:41.981 --> 00:47:43.660
my technology enthusiasm.

775
00:47:43.890 --> 00:47:46.950
<v 1>You like gadgets,
no mortgage,
no.
Yeah,</v>

776
00:47:46.951 --> 00:47:50.460
I think people are looking for connection and um,

777
00:47:50.910 --> 00:47:55.910
love and humor from their parents and their fathers.

778
00:47:56.760 --> 00:48:01.740
Um,
and the gadgets are such a,
there's such a means to something,
right?

779
00:48:01.741 --> 00:48:03.870
They're not an end.
Um,

780
00:48:03.930 --> 00:48:08.250
and they certainly don't replace human contact would be my thought.
Um,

781
00:48:08.910 --> 00:48:12.840
so
my father was,

782
00:48:13.380 --> 00:48:17.040
um,
when he was on his game,

783
00:48:17.730 --> 00:48:21.390
totally delightful to hang out with because he was interested in curious about a

784
00:48:21.390 --> 00:48:23.340
ton of things.
Um,

785
00:48:23.970 --> 00:48:28.970
and I guess the way technology is the best from my perspective is that it can

786
00:48:29.071 --> 00:48:32.790
help with that kind of curiosity and that kind of investigation,

787
00:48:33.060 --> 00:48:36.660
but it doesn't replace curiosity or hanging out together or spending time

788
00:48:36.661 --> 00:48:40.950
together.
And I think,
um,
in my experience of my father,

789
00:48:41.940 --> 00:48:46.470
he was not an exception to that.
He was not,
he did not seem gadget obsessed.
Um,

790
00:48:46.770 --> 00:48:50.040
he knew that,
um,
I wasn't,

791
00:48:51.390 --> 00:48:55.620
you know,
going to talk with him for hours about the iPhone.
Um,

792
00:48:56.460 --> 00:49:01.460
so we would take skates and talk about roses and talk about architecture and

793
00:49:01.741 --> 00:49:04.890
talk about Fonts and talk about Palo Alto.

794
00:49:05.400 --> 00:49:08.640
And he seemed very interested in those things.

795
00:49:08.641 --> 00:49:11.100
And I guess interest and curiosity are infectious.

796
00:49:12.480 --> 00:49:16.200
So I think you're doing great.
Awesome.

797
00:49:16.710 --> 00:49:17.690
Thank you so much for coming.

798
00:49:18.090 --> 00:49:18.330
<v 0>Thank you.</v>
