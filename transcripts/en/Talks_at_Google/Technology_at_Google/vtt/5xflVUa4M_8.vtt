[inaudible]

2
00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:15.130
<v 2>Google,
many Googlers here and those tuning in around the world.
Welcome.</v>

3
00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:19.600
And it's terrific to have in here.
So if you're familiar at all with politics,

4
00:00:19.601 --> 00:00:23.080
economics or general government affairs over the past few years,

5
00:00:23.081 --> 00:00:25.570
you're obviously familiar with Robert Reich.

6
00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:29.800
Certainly there's more than a few things happening in the public spheres or

7
00:00:30.010 --> 00:00:32.940
incredibly honored to be with you today.
Robert Reich,
everyone

8
00:00:33.370 --> 00:00:38.370
<v 1>[inaudible]</v>

9
00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:45.540
<v 0>well,
thank you very much John and up.
Hello Google.</v>

10
00:00:50.490 --> 00:00:52.800
We're gathered today and a kind of,
uh,

11
00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:57.270
auspicious or in auspicious moment and the history of our republic.

12
00:00:58.200 --> 00:01:00.990
And I want to spend a little bit of time,

13
00:01:00.991 --> 00:01:03.510
I want to spend most of my time taking your questions actually,

14
00:01:03.511 --> 00:01:07.320
but I want to spend a little bit of time setting up those questions by

15
00:01:07.321 --> 00:01:11.280
suggesting to you that you are part of the problem and part of the solution.

16
00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:18.360
Okay.
Uh,
in terms of part of the problem,

17
00:01:18.361 --> 00:01:20.490
and I don't mean you particularly,

18
00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:24.940
but I mean technology is a little bit part of the problem because a,

19
00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:28.590
there's been a great deal of job displacement and it's,

20
00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:31.790
there will be even more job displacement.
And,
uh,

21
00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:37.460
if you look carefully at the counties that voted for,

22
00:01:39.001 --> 00:01:42.810
and I don't mean to be partisan and what I'm saying,
this is just pure fact.

23
00:01:43.980 --> 00:01:47.010
Even though we're heading toward a fact free universe,

24
00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:49.950
I'm going to stick to facts.
Uh,

25
00:01:49.980 --> 00:01:52.440
just look at the counties that voted for Donald Trump.

26
00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:57.630
You see that the regardless,
it really doesn't track necessarily income.

27
00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:01.080
The biggest correlation is our,

28
00:02:01.081 --> 00:02:06.081
is the median wage or median income in that county going down or going up if

29
00:02:07.771 --> 00:02:11.360
it's going down,
regardless of where it started.
Uh,

30
00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:13.980
those tend to be Trump voters.

31
00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:18.780
Now you may ask yourself,

32
00:02:18.781 --> 00:02:23.781
why is it the median incomes are stagnant or declining nationally?

33
00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:28.920
A lot of it has to do with globalization,

34
00:02:28.921 --> 00:02:32.880
but more to the point,
it has to do with technology.

35
00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:37.740
Hard to separate globalization technology because technology and technological

36
00:02:37.741 --> 00:02:42.270
developments and advances had been responsible for making globalization easier,

37
00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:46.350
but they are quite separate in certain respects.

38
00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:50.130
And although many Americans blame globalization,

39
00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:53.700
it really is technological displacement.
Now,

40
00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:58.310
technological displacement has been with us for years and fact forever.
Ah,

41
00:02:58.350 --> 00:03:02.470
this is nothing new.
What's new is the pace of the displacement.

42
00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:03.670
It is faster.

43
00:03:03.820 --> 00:03:08.820
Now you are involved in all of that and we'll be involved even to a larger

44
00:03:09.191 --> 00:03:12.670
extent.
Uh,
you know,
the self driving car and truck,

45
00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:18.000
that's 3 million truckers and a million and a half other drivers who will no

46
00:03:18.341 --> 00:03:23.230
longer be earning their incomes.
Uh,
let's say,
what five years from now,

47
00:03:23.231 --> 00:03:26.710
10 years from now,
uh,
driving?
Well,

48
00:03:26.740 --> 00:03:31.740
what has happened to a lot of those people is not that they no longer have jobs.

49
00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:33.970
I mean,
unemployment is down,

50
00:03:34.210 --> 00:03:36.970
although we do have kind of a mystery what happened.

51
00:03:36.971 --> 00:03:40.330
A lot of men have exited from the labor force altogether,

52
00:03:40.690 --> 00:03:44.890
but generally speaking,
the problem is not numbers of jobs.

53
00:03:44.891 --> 00:03:47.530
The problem is the quality of the job,

54
00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:51.310
both in terms of income and job security.

55
00:03:51.940 --> 00:03:56.740
We have more and more people who are on a downward escalator in income and also

56
00:03:56.770 --> 00:03:57.650
very important lay.

57
00:03:57.651 --> 00:04:02.651
More people are worried about where their income will come from our next month

58
00:04:03.610 --> 00:04:04.900
or six months from now.

59
00:04:06.090 --> 00:04:08.850
Most people have fixed costs,

60
00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:13.620
the rent or mortgages or utilities or whatever,

61
00:04:13.860 --> 00:04:16.980
and they have more and more variable incomes,

62
00:04:18.420 --> 00:04:20.010
which is making people nervous.

63
00:04:21.350 --> 00:04:21.780
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

64
00:04:21.780 --> 00:04:24.240
<v 0>If you looked at 2016,</v>

65
00:04:24.270 --> 00:04:29.270
the biggest single phenomenon in the 2016 election was the rise,

66
00:04:31.081 --> 00:04:35.280
both among Democrats and Republicans have what might be called populism.

67
00:04:35.800 --> 00:04:38.310
But populism is sort of a catch all phrase.

68
00:04:38.311 --> 00:04:41.070
What I really saw and did I,

69
00:04:41.071 --> 00:04:46.071
I began to see it in the fall of 2015 when I spent a lot of time researching,

70
00:04:47.660 --> 00:04:48.493
uh,

71
00:04:48.540 --> 00:04:52.800
a book I was writing and I wanted to go and spent a lot of it.

72
00:04:52.801 --> 00:04:56.850
I'm in red states,
so called red states,
heartland states,
uh,
in the south,

73
00:04:56.851 --> 00:04:57.684
in the Midwest.

74
00:04:57.900 --> 00:05:02.900
And what I kept on coming across with more and more people who told me that the

75
00:05:03.151 --> 00:05:07.520
game was rigged against them and they were trying to decide.
In fact,

76
00:05:08.540 --> 00:05:12.660
the first conversation I had was a group of,
of farmers in misery,
Missouri.

77
00:05:12.840 --> 00:05:16.980
They were trying to decide between Donald Trump and Bernie Sanders.

78
00:05:17.950 --> 00:05:18.480
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

79
00:05:18.480 --> 00:05:22.140
<v 0>And at first when they told me that I was a little bit surprised.</v>

80
00:05:22.710 --> 00:05:23.850
And then by Donald Trump.

81
00:05:23.851 --> 00:05:26.340
And Bernie Sanders didn't ever did not strike me at the time.

82
00:05:26.341 --> 00:05:28.260
It's the same sort of person.

83
00:05:28.650 --> 00:05:33.270
But what they were responding to in retrospect was indignation

84
00:05:35.030 --> 00:05:39.650
and the implied or explicit promise from Donald Trump and from Bernie Sanders

85
00:05:39.980 --> 00:05:44.150
that they would fundamentally change the system.

86
00:05:44.770 --> 00:05:45.040
<v 1>Okay?</v>

87
00:05:45.040 --> 00:05:47.770
<v 0>And they would make the system work once again,</v>

88
00:05:47.950 --> 00:05:52.950
for average working people or for farmers or for a lot of people who have felt

89
00:05:53.530 --> 00:05:54.670
disenfranchised,

90
00:05:54.850 --> 00:05:59.850
left behind and more and more worried about themselves,

91
00:06:00.080 --> 00:06:01.640
their futures,
their kids.

92
00:06:02.540 --> 00:06:07.540
The American dream has always been that you would do better than your parents

93
00:06:08.091 --> 00:06:11.510
and your kids would do better than you.
According to polls,

94
00:06:11.870 --> 00:06:14.270
that's no longer the case.
For most Americans,

95
00:06:14.271 --> 00:06:17.660
they don't think that their kids will do better than they are doing.

96
00:06:18.230 --> 00:06:21.290
And if you look at actual analyses,

97
00:06:21.291 --> 00:06:26.291
you see that about 50% or more of children born in the early 1980s will not do

98
00:06:30.531 --> 00:06:31.850
better than their parents.

99
00:06:32.510 --> 00:06:37.510
By contrast to kids born in the early fifties baby boomers,

100
00:06:39.500 --> 00:06:44.500
95% of whom ended up or actually have done better than their parents.

101
00:06:47.270 --> 00:06:51.020
You have to understand this not only as an economic reality but as a

102
00:06:51.021 --> 00:06:54.890
sociological reality.
This is a shock to America.

103
00:06:56.030 --> 00:06:59.870
And when the banks and I,
I actually,

104
00:06:59.960 --> 00:07:01.210
I actually think there was a,

105
00:07:01.620 --> 00:07:06.620
a single point where this was set off politically and it was the bailout of Wall

106
00:07:07.041 --> 00:07:10.500
Street.
Uh,
because before then,
uh,

107
00:07:10.580 --> 00:07:13.940
people were sort of aware that they were getting nowhere and,

108
00:07:13.941 --> 00:07:16.350
and their median wages were stagnant.
Uh,

109
00:07:16.400 --> 00:07:19.820
and there was a lot of discussion about that and anxiety about that,

110
00:07:20.030 --> 00:07:24.200
but they didn't think the game was rigged against them.
What happened was,

111
00:07:24.770 --> 00:07:29.600
as you remember,
the big banks were bailed out under tarp homeowners,

112
00:07:29.601 --> 00:07:31.010
we're supposed to be helped,

113
00:07:31.220 --> 00:07:36.220
but they really got very little help and no single executive in any big bank

114
00:07:37.160 --> 00:07:39.800
went to jail.
Now there may be good reasons for that.

115
00:07:39.830 --> 00:07:41.570
Maybe bad reasons that's irrelevant.

116
00:07:42.350 --> 00:07:47.350
What happened is out of the Wall Street bailout you had on the left the occupy

117
00:07:47.841 --> 00:07:49.820
movement,
which didn't last all that long.

118
00:07:50.150 --> 00:07:53.960
And you also had on the right,
the tea party movement,

119
00:07:54.200 --> 00:07:58.910
which lasted for a while before it got cooptive by big money.

120
00:07:59.540 --> 00:08:04.540
And so you've got to sort of uprisings in 2009 2010 2011 2012 and then you have

121
00:08:10.010 --> 00:08:14.480
Trump and Sanders direct lineal descendants.

122
00:08:17.830 --> 00:08:22.830
It's important I think to understand that Donald Trump did not get to be

123
00:08:24.131 --> 00:08:29.131
president because of racism or misogyny or xenophobia.

124
00:08:31.240 --> 00:08:34.180
I say that because racism,
misogyny,

125
00:08:34.181 --> 00:08:37.780
and xenophobia had been with us since the founding of the republic.

126
00:08:38.740 --> 00:08:40.990
These are not new feelings.

127
00:08:42.160 --> 00:08:47.160
What Donald Trump did is utilize economic anxiety as his vehicle to channel

128
00:08:51.910 --> 00:08:56.850
racism and misogyny and xenophobia and a lot of other things.

129
00:08:59.010 --> 00:09:04.010
We are in an era now where the real battle is not between the Democrats,

130
00:09:04.171 --> 00:09:05.850
Republicans or right and left.

131
00:09:06.090 --> 00:09:11.090
The real battle is between what I call authoritarian populism and what you might

132
00:09:12.991 --> 00:09:14.790
call progressive populism.

133
00:09:15.270 --> 00:09:17.580
The difference between them is that an authority pilot,

134
00:09:17.581 --> 00:09:22.581
authoritarian populism essentially is nativist and senior phobic tramp on not

135
00:09:23.491 --> 00:09:25.650
only human rights,
but also

136
00:09:27.750 --> 00:09:32.280
channels,
anger,
just scapegoats toward scapegoats and we're seeing that.

137
00:09:32.310 --> 00:09:37.260
We saw it in the first week of the Trump administration and the progressive

138
00:09:37.261 --> 00:09:41.520
populous movement.
To the extent that there is such a movement is pro democracy.

139
00:09:41.521 --> 00:09:41.961
It's a it,

140
00:09:41.961 --> 00:09:46.170
it looks to strengthening democratic institutions rather than overriding them.

141
00:09:49.730 --> 00:09:54.200
Technology is good.
We cannot be and should not be.

142
00:09:54.320 --> 00:09:55.550
Neo Luddites,

143
00:09:56.870 --> 00:10:01.870
what you guys have done at Google and you are the leaders in the world and I

144
00:10:02.271 --> 00:10:03.320
congratulate you for it.

145
00:10:04.310 --> 00:10:07.820
You have great given people a vision and you continue to give vision people

146
00:10:07.821 --> 00:10:12.821
visions of what can be of how life can be better and that's wonderful and don't

147
00:10:15.891 --> 00:10:20.390
ever stop,
but that's not enough.

148
00:10:22.200 --> 00:10:27.200
What I want to suggest to you is that there are two areas where we need your

149
00:10:28.321 --> 00:10:28.920
help.

150
00:10:28.920 --> 00:10:33.120
I don't know enough about technology to suggest exactly what you need to do in

151
00:10:33.121 --> 00:10:36.630
each of these areas,
but I do know that we need your help.

152
00:10:36.631 --> 00:10:39.450
We being our society and even the world

153
00:10:41.250 --> 00:10:42.750
one has to do with

154
00:10:45.120 --> 00:10:48.150
enabling people to live better,

155
00:10:48.180 --> 00:10:53.180
even though they may have lower incomes now you could and we can.

156
00:10:57.270 --> 00:10:58.380
If we're very clever,

157
00:10:58.560 --> 00:11:03.480
we could give people the skills they need to maybe get better jobs in the

158
00:11:03.481 --> 00:11:08.280
future.
That is there is a kind of skills mismatch but that's not the big,

159
00:11:08.281 --> 00:11:09.114
big problem.

160
00:11:09.450 --> 00:11:14.450
The bigger problem is that as we move to a new world of technological

161
00:11:14.761 --> 00:11:17.190
displacement,
all of huge number of people,

162
00:11:17.490 --> 00:11:22.490
much larger than right now are going to lose the jobs they have and be forced

163
00:11:24.031 --> 00:11:28.350
into lower wage work.
It's not that they won't have jobs,
they will have jobs.

164
00:11:28.410 --> 00:11:33.410
It's just lower wage jobs given supply and demand and less secure jobs.

165
00:11:35.750 --> 00:11:37.220
So we need,

166
00:11:37.221 --> 00:11:42.221
and you need to think about with people who are very much entrenched in the

167
00:11:43.551 --> 00:11:47.630
world of political science and sociology and politics.

168
00:11:47.631 --> 00:11:52.631
Generally you need to think about how we construct an income supplement that

169
00:11:55.001 --> 00:11:59.560
works much better than the earned income tax credit and also what might be

170
00:11:59.561 --> 00:12:03.160
called and his cub club a lot of things,
but a guaranteed minimum income.

171
00:12:03.340 --> 00:12:08.070
In the future.
We're also going to have to get much,

172
00:12:08.310 --> 00:12:13.310
much cleverer about strengthening democratic institutions.

173
00:12:16.440 --> 00:12:18.420
Now in your heads,

174
00:12:18.630 --> 00:12:23.610
both of those tasks that is supplementing incomes or having a minimum guaranteed

175
00:12:23.611 --> 00:12:27.180
income and also strengthening democratic institutions.

176
00:12:27.330 --> 00:12:32.010
They may sound that non technological.
They are,
I believe,
technological and part.

177
00:12:35.110 --> 00:12:40.110
And I would love there to be some convening of those of you who are

178
00:12:41.110 --> 00:12:46.110
technologically clever and creative with some people who are deeply entrenched

179
00:12:47.140 --> 00:12:51.250
in the politics and sociology and understand what's happening and the economics

180
00:12:51.550 --> 00:12:55.990
and try to come up with some range of solutions.

181
00:12:57.640 --> 00:13:01.330
Now quickly,
let me say something about Donald Trump.
Uh,

182
00:13:02.350 --> 00:13:07.350
because the issue here to me is not right versus left Democrats versus

183
00:13:09.011 --> 00:13:13.060
Republicans,
a standard set of issues.
We can have differences.

184
00:13:13.061 --> 00:13:14.560
We do have differences in this country,

185
00:13:14.740 --> 00:13:19.630
on the environment or on women's reproductive rights or on emigration or on a

186
00:13:19.631 --> 00:13:24.250
lot of issues.
And we've had fights for years over all of this.

187
00:13:24.760 --> 00:13:26.680
But there's something different here.

188
00:13:28.390 --> 00:13:32.680
One big difference has to do with something I just alluded to and that is

189
00:13:34.030 --> 00:13:36.460
tyranny.
And I'm using that term advisedly.

190
00:13:36.490 --> 00:13:41.490
I'm simply talking about I dis missile and disrespect I've democratic

191
00:13:42.941 --> 00:13:47.230
institutions versus a constitutional democracy.

192
00:13:48.550 --> 00:13:51.100
And on the basis of the first week of the Trump administration,

193
00:13:51.101 --> 00:13:53.350
I've got to tell you,
I am frankly very worried.

194
00:13:55.990 --> 00:13:58.480
The second level of my concern,
again,

195
00:13:58.481 --> 00:14:03.481
has nothing to do with right versus left and it doesn't even have to do with

196
00:14:03.761 --> 00:14:06.100
Tierra neighbors is democracy and democratic institutions.

197
00:14:06.520 --> 00:14:10.810
It has to do with a personality disorder.

198
00:14:12.760 --> 00:14:17.760
I would take a right wing president over somebody who demonstrates all of the

199
00:14:21.521 --> 00:14:24.790
characteristics of a sociopath.

200
00:14:25.900 --> 00:14:30.310
And I say that quite seriously.
I think we're in trouble.

201
00:14:32.090 --> 00:14:36.490
Uh,
I know that there is a 25th amendment to the Constitution that provides a

202
00:14:36.491 --> 00:14:41.491
vehicle for removing presidents who are mentally impaired in some way.

203
00:14:43.120 --> 00:14:45.040
Maybe that's the way we go,

204
00:14:45.550 --> 00:14:50.550
but I am quite shocked as some of you are at the disregard at the kind of

205
00:14:52.641 --> 00:14:54.970
craziness.
I mean,
I've,
I'd been in White House.

206
00:14:55.020 --> 00:14:58.610
My first job was in the Ford Administration.
I mean I,

207
00:14:58.611 --> 00:15:02.150
that was a Republican administration.
Do you remember?
I worked,

208
00:15:02.151 --> 00:15:06.230
my first job actually in the Ford Administration was in the Justice Department

209
00:15:06.470 --> 00:15:08.840
and I worked for a man named Robert Bork.

210
00:15:10.250 --> 00:15:12.800
So I am not,
you know,

211
00:15:12.801 --> 00:15:16.460
although I am now labeled as a card carrying Liberal Democrat,

212
00:15:16.820 --> 00:15:21.820
I have seen government for years in many different situations and many were

213
00:15:23.541 --> 00:15:28.070
under many different presidents.
I've never seen anything like this.
This is,

214
00:15:28.160 --> 00:15:31.670
this is a problem folks.
And it's our problem.

215
00:15:37.070 --> 00:15:42.070
So another issue that I hope that you can help me with and help the country with

216
00:15:43.940 --> 00:15:47.060
is how to strengthen democracy at the grass roots.

217
00:15:47.330 --> 00:15:52.330
I am overwhelmed with people asking me and I'm sure that they've asked you or

218
00:15:54.470 --> 00:15:57.890
they're kind of your,
your friends are asking,
what can I do?

219
00:16:01.440 --> 00:16:02.010
Well,

220
00:16:02.010 --> 00:16:07.010
it would be great if there were a simple app where you could get together with a

221
00:16:07.171 --> 00:16:11.490
lot of people in your local congressional district or your local people who,

222
00:16:11.610 --> 00:16:13.320
who feel as you do.

223
00:16:13.321 --> 00:16:18.150
And you could develop a way of putting pressure on your members of Congress and

224
00:16:18.151 --> 00:16:23.151
you could also get together with sister districts and purple states.

225
00:16:23.820 --> 00:16:28.820
And you could also have some fairly direct and easy options for expressing

226
00:16:30.241 --> 00:16:33.480
yourself and expressing yourself politically.

227
00:16:33.481 --> 00:16:36.480
Because I think the demonstrations and raising a Ruckus are great,

228
00:16:36.690 --> 00:16:40.930
but they're easy.
They're too easy.

229
00:16:40.960 --> 00:16:45.960
What we need to do is mobilize and organize and we need to get Republicans and

230
00:16:46.211 --> 00:16:49.150
Democrats together to organize and mobilize.

231
00:16:49.151 --> 00:16:53.020
Cause if this is seen as a partisan issue,

232
00:16:53.980 --> 00:16:58.600
it's going to be dead on arrival and it's going to normalize a situation that

233
00:16:58.601 --> 00:16:59.950
should not be normalized.

234
00:17:04.350 --> 00:17:05.880
So on that upbeat note,

235
00:17:08.070 --> 00:17:12.660
I've given you your assignments and a,
I would like to take your questions

236
00:17:16.830 --> 00:17:21.830
<v 1>[inaudible]</v>

237
00:17:24.950 --> 00:17:25.421
<v 0>uh,
well,</v>

238
00:17:25.421 --> 00:17:30.400
the strongest objections to universal basic income pretty predictably are people

239
00:17:30.401 --> 00:17:32.960
who say,
Oh,
this is socialist,
another social idea.

240
00:17:33.100 --> 00:17:35.740
Or if people get a lot of money getting money,

241
00:17:35.800 --> 00:17:39.630
they're just going to piss it away.
Uh,
they're not gonna,
you know,

242
00:17:39.640 --> 00:17:41.580
they're going to adjust a sit down and,

243
00:17:41.640 --> 00:17:45.050
and never get up and buy drugs or whatever.
The,

244
00:17:45.190 --> 00:17:47.170
the experiments that have been done to date,

245
00:17:47.560 --> 00:17:52.020
and there are a number of them and there are more coming suggest that people

246
00:17:52.050 --> 00:17:56.550
really don't want to just sit and do nothing.
They really,

247
00:17:56.551 --> 00:18:01.020
people want to work or they want to write music or they want to read or they

248
00:18:01.021 --> 00:18:04.800
want to,
you know,
people don't just sit and do nothing.

249
00:18:04.801 --> 00:18:09.801
So the idea of a universal basic income as a kind of license to opt out is

250
00:18:10.980 --> 00:18:13.500
ridiculous on the basis of what we know.

251
00:18:14.220 --> 00:18:18.380
But we've got to get through the ideological problem in which people say,
oh,

252
00:18:18.400 --> 00:18:19.800
that's socialism.

253
00:18:19.980 --> 00:18:22.980
I think one way of doing it is to design the universal basic income.

254
00:18:22.981 --> 00:18:27.420
So it's basically just covers minimum needs.

255
00:18:28.020 --> 00:18:30.740
Depending upon where you live,
it's going to be different,
uh,
in,

256
00:18:30.741 --> 00:18:34.770
in San Francisco than it is in,
uh,
in Missouri.
Uh,

257
00:18:34.870 --> 00:18:39.870
but it covers your minimum needs in terms of clothing and shelter and food.

258
00:18:40.590 --> 00:18:42.900
But if you want anything more than that,
you're going to have to work

259
00:18:44.820 --> 00:18:49.380
that will at least quell some of the distress about this.

260
00:18:49.590 --> 00:18:50.423
I think secondly,

261
00:18:50.460 --> 00:18:55.460
it's got to be built on the most popular programs we have in government.

262
00:18:58.020 --> 00:19:00.510
What's your social security and Medicare?
In fact,

263
00:19:00.511 --> 00:19:02.550
if I were designing universal basic income,

264
00:19:02.730 --> 00:19:05.130
I wouldn't even announce it as universal basic income.

265
00:19:05.131 --> 00:19:08.940
I make up another word I and I'd make it title five of social security.

266
00:19:09.920 --> 00:19:13.970
Hi.
Um,
uh,
my question comes from,

267
00:19:14.510 --> 00:19:18.470
do you know who Chris?
Our,
Nate,
is he someone who on Twitter?
So his,

268
00:19:18.560 --> 00:19:20.900
his sort of point about universal income.

269
00:19:20.960 --> 00:19:25.400
His work is often the source of meaning in people's lives.

270
00:19:25.910 --> 00:19:29.900
I know it is for me,
uh,
with my colleagues and so on.
So how do,

271
00:19:29.930 --> 00:19:32.770
how would universal income take care of that issue?
Well,

272
00:19:32.780 --> 00:19:34.930
work is a source of meaning.
Uh,

273
00:19:34.970 --> 00:19:39.590
and it's also a structure that gives people meaning.

274
00:19:40.090 --> 00:19:42.880
But universal basic income doesn't mean we get rid of work.

275
00:19:44.540 --> 00:19:45.373
That's my point.

276
00:19:46.040 --> 00:19:50.030
People are still going to work and work has by the,
by the,

277
00:19:50.031 --> 00:19:52.520
by two different meanings in this context.

278
00:19:52.670 --> 00:19:54.920
Some of it is paid work and some of it is unpaid work.

279
00:19:54.921 --> 00:19:59.520
I charitable work is very important work.
So yes,

280
00:19:59.521 --> 00:20:03.510
we want people to work,
but we don't necessarily want them to be,

281
00:20:04.530 --> 00:20:09.530
have to work on three or four jobs 60 70 hours a week and not make,

282
00:20:11.850 --> 00:20:16.850
even then not make enough to support their families because technology and

283
00:20:18.180 --> 00:20:22.860
incidentally,
less importantly,
globalization is taking away their livelihoods.

284
00:20:26.090 --> 00:20:27.220
<v 2>Have you ever questioned from the door?</v>

285
00:20:27.790 --> 00:20:31.750
How can we help the people like the proud coal miners who've worked very hard at

286
00:20:31.751 --> 00:20:32.890
a job that's going away,

287
00:20:33.190 --> 00:20:36.790
who linked their self worth through your work and don't just want handouts and

288
00:20:36.791 --> 00:20:38.080
resent the people who received them,

289
00:20:38.590 --> 00:20:41.650
but they don't have any marketable skills and they just want their old job back.

290
00:20:42.950 --> 00:20:47.290
<v 0>Uh,
well that there's not just the universal basic income.</v>

291
00:20:47.291 --> 00:20:51.280
There is also something that needs to be expanded right now and can be,

292
00:20:51.340 --> 00:20:53.140
we don't have to wait for the universal basic income.

293
00:20:53.410 --> 00:20:57.280
And that's called the earned income tax credit.
That is a wage subsidy.

294
00:20:58.060 --> 00:20:59.440
And if you have,

295
00:20:59.441 --> 00:21:04.441
the hardest problem has to do with groups of employees or workers who are

296
00:21:07.840 --> 00:21:12.310
impacted in a geographic area where there's not a lot of alternative work.

297
00:21:12.311 --> 00:21:15.460
Coal mining is a good example.
I mean,
look,

298
00:21:16.270 --> 00:21:21.270
those jobs are not coming back and we've got to diversify those Appalachian

299
00:21:21.920 --> 00:21:22.753
economies.

300
00:21:23.860 --> 00:21:28.860
And that means create new possibilities and new work and new job ladders and new

301
00:21:29.021 --> 00:21:32.410
careers.
And it's gotta be relatively,

302
00:21:32.530 --> 00:21:35.800
it's gotta be realistic for these people.
They'd,
they'd been promised for years.

303
00:21:35.801 --> 00:21:39.610
Politicians have come in and said,
Oh yes,
we're going to have all kinds of uh,

304
00:21:39.670 --> 00:21:43.540
new jobs for you,
and then no joke,
no new jobs happen.
Look,

305
00:21:43.541 --> 00:21:46.780
when I talk about populist and the populist rebellion,

306
00:21:48.190 --> 00:21:48.650
<v 1>okay,</v>

307
00:21:48.650 --> 00:21:51.140
<v 0>I want you to really understand,</v>

308
00:21:51.141 --> 00:21:55.190
and this is maybe it could be hard because you know,

309
00:21:55.370 --> 00:21:58.920
you're pretty well off and you're living in the pencil in the,

310
00:21:58.980 --> 00:22:03.770
in the peninsula here or maybe people that were tuning in our living fairly
well.

311
00:22:04.100 --> 00:22:09.100
There are very large number of people in this country and also in other advanced

312
00:22:09.891 --> 00:22:14.891
industrial countries who are on a downward escalator and that is frightening.

313
00:22:17.190 --> 00:22:19.980
Hillary Clinton began her campaign

314
00:22:22.120 --> 00:22:25.870
with the statement that I thought extraordinary.

315
00:22:26.650 --> 00:22:27.550
She said,

316
00:22:27.850 --> 00:22:32.410
the deck is stacked in favor of those at the top.

317
00:22:32.830 --> 00:22:37.300
Now this is Hillary Clinton.
Hillary Clinton,
you know,
is,

318
00:22:37.360 --> 00:22:40.720
is as close to an establishment figure.
In fact,

319
00:22:40.721 --> 00:22:43.660
she did play the establishment figure,
ironically,

320
00:22:44.590 --> 00:22:48.460
allowing Donald Trump to play the anti establishment figure when in fact,

321
00:22:48.490 --> 00:22:53.230
Donald Trump is probably more establishment than anybody certainly in this room

322
00:22:53.231 --> 00:22:57.880
or anybody I've ever met.
But nonetheless,
he played the outsider to her insider.

323
00:22:57.970 --> 00:23:02.440
And she and he and Bernie Sanders all gave the same theme.

324
00:23:02.590 --> 00:23:06.700
And that theme is the game is rigged against you.

325
00:23:06.880 --> 00:23:11.620
And the reason they gave that theme and the reason any politician says anything

326
00:23:11.621 --> 00:23:14.950
unless it's coming from their gut.
Then I think by the way,
Bernie Sanders,

327
00:23:15.250 --> 00:23:20.250
a lot of it was coming from his gut is because political consultants and

328
00:23:20.291 --> 00:23:22.060
pollsters are saying to these people,

329
00:23:22.720 --> 00:23:27.010
this is what people believe and unless you really believe to the contrary,

330
00:23:27.550 --> 00:23:29.770
this is where the country is right now.

331
00:23:30.660 --> 00:23:31.210
<v 1>Yeah,</v>

332
00:23:31.210 --> 00:23:35.470
<v 0>and so what I want to stress with you is that most Americans believe the game is</v>

333
00:23:35.471 --> 00:23:39.820
rigged against them.
And it's not just because they're not doing well,

334
00:23:40.150 --> 00:23:45.150
it's because they think that politics is corrupt and there.

335
00:23:47.391 --> 00:23:48.224
Right.

336
00:23:50.660 --> 00:23:55.160
Can I just spend a moment on this?
I mean I,
again,

337
00:23:55.161 --> 00:24:00.161
I've been in and out of politics all my life and the amount of money coming into

338
00:24:01.461 --> 00:24:04.010
American politics,
particularly from big companies,

339
00:24:04.160 --> 00:24:07.500
it used to be you had labor unions and you had public interest groups and you

340
00:24:07.501 --> 00:24:08.240
had all kinds of,

341
00:24:08.240 --> 00:24:13.240
it was a much bigger mix and it was nearly not nearly as much from big

342
00:24:13.341 --> 00:24:16.940
companies.
You had countervailing power,
you had smaller businesses,
you had,

343
00:24:17.000 --> 00:24:19.960
you had small local banks,
you had political powers,
uh,

344
00:24:20.000 --> 00:24:23.540
political parties that were located and,
and grounded in the local level.

345
00:24:23.541 --> 00:24:25.220
You had labor unions,
you know,

346
00:24:25.221 --> 00:24:30.221
in the 1950s one out of three people in the private sector in this country was a

347
00:24:30.441 --> 00:24:31.400
member of a labor union.

348
00:24:31.430 --> 00:24:36.430
Now fewer than 7% in the private sector are unionized workers.

349
00:24:36.620 --> 00:24:40.460
So you no longer have what John Kenneth Galbraith.

350
00:24:40.830 --> 00:24:45.620
It has great classic book of the early fifties called American capitalism.

351
00:24:45.770 --> 00:24:50.120
The theory of countervailing power.
You no longer have countervailing power.

352
00:24:50.450 --> 00:24:53.330
You basically only have in Washington,

353
00:24:53.630 --> 00:24:57.470
big companies and a lot of money and a lot of lobbyists.

354
00:24:57.830 --> 00:25:01.130
And they are calling the shots.

355
00:25:02.930 --> 00:25:07.280
And what are they doing?
Well,
they are not evil.

356
00:25:08.090 --> 00:25:10.160
They're not trying to be bad or evil,

357
00:25:10.161 --> 00:25:14.810
but they are simply pursuing their own interests and the cumulative effect of

358
00:25:14.811 --> 00:25:19.811
every big company pursuing it's own interests is what it's tax cuts for.

359
00:25:21.471 --> 00:25:26.030
Big Corporations is regulatory,
so-called relief.

360
00:25:26.300 --> 00:25:31.300
It is all sorts of rules for the pharmaceutical company that actually increases

361
00:25:33.171 --> 00:25:35.000
pharmaceutical prices.

362
00:25:35.600 --> 00:25:40.250
It's all sorts of monopolistic and monopsony mystic outcomes that actually take

363
00:25:40.251 --> 00:25:43.790
money from average working people.
And where does the money go?

364
00:25:43.820 --> 00:25:46.550
It goes to shareholders and executives,

365
00:25:47.630 --> 00:25:50.390
but this is not a plot and I'm not criticizing anybody.

366
00:25:50.391 --> 00:25:55.391
This is simply systemically what people in this country are beginning to

367
00:25:55.551 --> 00:25:58.040
recognize and it's not left or right.

368
00:25:59.750 --> 00:26:03.980
I had a meeting of a couple of months ago with a fellow named at David Brat.

369
00:26:04.700 --> 00:26:08.240
How many of you know he is a politician?
Put up your hands if you know who he is.

370
00:26:09.170 --> 00:26:13.130
None of you,
David Brat you do over there.

371
00:26:13.220 --> 00:26:16.880
David Brats,
according to the congressional

372
00:26:18.530 --> 00:26:23.530
conservative digest is one of the two most conservative members of Congress.

373
00:26:25.550 --> 00:26:29.900
He's from the seventh district of Virginia.
Richmond.
Why do I mention him?

374
00:26:30.020 --> 00:26:34.190
Because he in the primary Republican primary,
two years ago,
three years ago now,

375
00:26:34.340 --> 00:26:37.130
he deposed Eric cantor

376
00:26:38.630 --> 00:26:43.010
by saying that Eric Cantor was guilty of crony capitalism.
He,

377
00:26:43.200 --> 00:26:47.430
his whole campaign around Eric Cantor being too close to Wall Street and too

378
00:26:47.431 --> 00:26:50.010
close to big money and basically corrupt.

379
00:26:52.510 --> 00:26:57.510
And I spent an afternoon with David Brat about six months ago and he could have

380
00:26:58.961 --> 00:27:03.961
been Bernie Sanders except with regard to climate change and women's

381
00:27:05.411 --> 00:27:10.090
reproductive rights and a bunch of others.
But on the issues of crony capitalism,

382
00:27:11.800 --> 00:27:15.190
he is where a lot of republican conservatives are.

383
00:27:15.670 --> 00:27:18.490
This is not a partisan issue.

384
00:27:19.750 --> 00:27:23.620
And so we've got to figure out how to strengthen democratic institutions.

385
00:27:24.950 --> 00:27:27.170
<v 3>Oh,
it was kind of wondering what you thought might be the,
um,</v>

386
00:27:28.970 --> 00:27:33.970
or if you see a path for unions to sort of adapt and evolve in response to the

387
00:27:34.641 --> 00:27:37.500
nature of the Gig economy.
And,
and also,
um,

388
00:27:37.670 --> 00:27:42.410
I was thinking about wash tech and a Cwa,
um,

389
00:27:42.440 --> 00:27:45.070
just because like beyond,
uh,

390
00:27:45.350 --> 00:27:47.900
their own purpose with respect to employers,

391
00:27:47.901 --> 00:27:51.880
they provide spaces for barnstorms and things like that.
And,
uh,

392
00:27:51.890 --> 00:27:53.930
other vital aspects of democracy.

393
00:27:53.931 --> 00:27:57.440
Like do you see a public replacement for that sort of structure?

394
00:27:58.540 --> 00:27:59.580
<v 0>Uh,
well I,</v>

395
00:27:59.630 --> 00:28:03.870
I know that there's a movement toward associations and groups of employees that

396
00:28:03.871 --> 00:28:07.020
can negotiate because they have economies of scale,

397
00:28:07.270 --> 00:28:11.070
a better rates for health care,
health insurance,
pensions,
whatever.

398
00:28:11.280 --> 00:28:13.080
And that's all I think to the good.

399
00:28:13.500 --> 00:28:18.500
But in the retail and restaurant and hotel and hospital sectors of the economy,

400
00:28:18.660 --> 00:28:23.070
you've got a lot of low wage workers who don't have a voice and they need union

401
00:28:23.071 --> 00:28:27.270
representation and they're not in direct competition with globalization.

402
00:28:27.390 --> 00:28:30.480
And many of them are not in direct competition right now with technology.

403
00:28:31.020 --> 00:28:32.940
And so they ought to,

404
00:28:32.970 --> 00:28:36.600
it seems to me have more union Howard behind them.

405
00:28:37.470 --> 00:28:39.660
If you understand the drift of what I'm saying,

406
00:28:40.050 --> 00:28:45.050
there's a structural change in the economy in addition to everything else that

407
00:28:45.181 --> 00:28:47.160
is more monopolization.

408
00:28:47.880 --> 00:28:51.480
At the same time you have le Let's unionization and if you've got more

409
00:28:51.481 --> 00:28:55.980
monopolization and yes,
less unionization,
you're tipping the scales,

410
00:28:57.690 --> 00:29:01.290
strong artificial intelligence will create a comparative advantage for the

411
00:29:01.291 --> 00:29:02.220
country that has it.

412
00:29:02.760 --> 00:29:06.480
I would also equalizes comparative advantages between countries,
the both habit.

413
00:29:07.060 --> 00:29:12.000
Uh,
do you have thoughts about how this will affect global trade?
Uh,

414
00:29:12.030 --> 00:29:15.780
question about artificial intelligence and global trade?

415
00:29:17.180 --> 00:29:17.660
Uh,

416
00:29:17.660 --> 00:29:22.660
I really think we're going to spend less and less time worrying about trade

417
00:29:23.221 --> 00:29:24.054
imbalances.

418
00:29:24.630 --> 00:29:29.630
It's becoming less and less important because you've got more and more direct

419
00:29:29.911 --> 00:29:31.590
investment,
foreign direct investments.

420
00:29:31.770 --> 00:29:34.920
You've got American companies directly investing over there.
Uh,

421
00:29:34.980 --> 00:29:38.220
they're coming here.
Who's us,
who's them.

422
00:29:38.370 --> 00:29:41.290
It's almost impossible to tell any longer,
uh,

423
00:29:41.291 --> 00:29:46.291
and to fixate on as Donald Trump has American companies and they say,

424
00:29:46.841 --> 00:29:51.730
well,
we American companies have been shafted by foreign companies,

425
00:29:51.950 --> 00:29:56.950
is to create a mythology that really is very misleading.

426
00:29:59.890 --> 00:30:04.090
They're all global companies.
Everybody's doing everything everywhere.
And it's,

427
00:30:04.120 --> 00:30:08.530
this isn't new.
When I,
I remember when I was secretary of Labor,
I,
uh,

428
00:30:09.640 --> 00:30:11.590
one,
one weekend,
my wife and I,

429
00:30:11.650 --> 00:30:16.120
we needed to get a new car and we went to the local and Washington Toyota dealer

430
00:30:16.450 --> 00:30:19.960
and we found a perfect car to meet,
aren't family needs.
And I went,

431
00:30:20.140 --> 00:30:24.550
we didn't buy it right away.
I went back to my office and my political advisor,

432
00:30:24.580 --> 00:30:27.670
you know when you're in the cabinet,
you always have a political advisor.
He said,

433
00:30:27.671 --> 00:30:30.250
how was your weekend,
Mr Secretary?
I said,
well,
actually,
very good.

434
00:30:30.251 --> 00:30:33.790
I think we found a car.
And he said,
and what kind of car?
And I said,
well,

435
00:30:33.791 --> 00:30:36.790
it was a,
it's a Toyota and he would there a pause.

436
00:30:39.370 --> 00:30:39.890
<v 1>Okay.</v>

437
00:30:39.890 --> 00:30:41.090
<v 0>And he said that Mr Secretary,</v>

438
00:30:41.091 --> 00:30:45.350
may I be so bold as to suggest that because you were secretary of labor of the

439
00:30:45.351 --> 00:30:49.520
United States,
you might pick an American name,
clay,
a car.

440
00:30:49.940 --> 00:30:53.840
And I immediately,
I immediately saw the wisdom,
the subtlety of is agile

441
00:30:53.950 --> 00:30:54.783
<v 1>mine.</v>

442
00:30:56.750 --> 00:30:59.060
<v 0>And I understood why I needed a political adviser.</v>

443
00:31:01.120 --> 00:31:06.120
So the next weekend we went to a Ford dealership and I picked out a car and I

444
00:31:06.881 --> 00:31:10.990
said before we picked it out,
before we bought it,
I said to the dealer,

445
00:31:11.140 --> 00:31:13.060
now you've got it.
I know this is a Ford,

446
00:31:13.210 --> 00:31:17.020
but you've got to tell me what is this made in the United States by American

447
00:31:17.021 --> 00:31:17.854
workers?

448
00:31:18.310 --> 00:31:23.310
And he looked at me for a long time trying to decide was I one of those or was

449
00:31:24.451 --> 00:31:28.060
that one of those?
And finally he looked up with a smile and said,

450
00:31:28.120 --> 00:31:28.953
which would you prefer?

451
00:31:32.370 --> 00:31:33.203
<v 1>I'm in the back.</v>

452
00:31:33.360 --> 00:31:38.000
<v 0>The matter is the Toyota had that Toyota then I looked at had just about exactly</v>

453
00:31:38.001 --> 00:31:41.360
the same domestic content as the Ford we were looking at.
I mean,

454
00:31:41.630 --> 00:31:45.770
it's complete rubbish in terms of American company.

455
00:31:45.771 --> 00:31:47.630
If we're talking about a big global companies,
they,

456
00:31:47.631 --> 00:31:48.530
you can't tell the difference.

457
00:31:50.430 --> 00:31:50.911
<v 4>So as it,</v>

458
00:31:50.911 --> 00:31:53.510
I'm a little embarrassed it as a trained economist I'm about to ask to non

459
00:31:53.511 --> 00:31:56.910
economic question.
Um,
so,
uh,
but in line with your homework,

460
00:31:56.940 --> 00:31:59.910
which was not economic,
but the more sociological,
uh,

461
00:31:59.911 --> 00:32:03.720
one of the things I personally find alarming about the current situation is I'm

462
00:32:03.721 --> 00:32:07.470
a senior erosion and rejection of both attritional opinion leaders and also

463
00:32:07.471 --> 00:32:09.780
sorts of fact.
So when Angela intellectual strain,

464
00:32:10.110 --> 00:32:14.460
rejection of scientific outcomes,
but also something as striking as,
um,

465
00:32:14.580 --> 00:32:15.480
the vast majority,

466
00:32:15.481 --> 00:32:18.870
I think Trump had a grand total globally have something on your less than 10

467
00:32:18.900 --> 00:32:20.820
newspaper endorsements.
And,
um,

468
00:32:21.120 --> 00:32:24.840
his opponent had endorsements from papers across the spectrum and it seemed to

469
00:32:24.841 --> 00:32:29.460
make absolutely no difference.
Um,
you've seen,
you know,
even today you have,

470
00:32:29.570 --> 00:32:33.120
um,
a number of senior members of the Republican party coming out and speaking

471
00:32:33.121 --> 00:32:37.110
against individual,
um,
uh,
positive actions by president Trump.

472
00:32:37.500 --> 00:32:40.760
And it doesn't appear that that's any impact on the base.

473
00:32:41.120 --> 00:32:45.550
And so it just seems this,
that can,
how do you have a,

474
00:32:45.810 --> 00:32:50.810
a discussion around civics and around responsibility and democracy when there is

475
00:32:51.771 --> 00:32:55.790
a seeming vacuum in opinion leaders to form public opinion.

476
00:32:55.850 --> 00:32:59.990
And if banks even a rejection of by swaths of population in the intellectual

477
00:32:59.991 --> 00:33:02.270
rigor that gets you to good outcomes.

478
00:33:02.590 --> 00:33:03.970
<v 0>Well,
first of all,
you've got to understand them.</v>

479
00:33:04.210 --> 00:33:09.210
One of the ancillary casualties of this populist revolt is the mainstream media

480
00:33:13.660 --> 00:33:16.090
and a lot of so-called opinion leaders.

481
00:33:16.960 --> 00:33:21.960
And that's a big casualty and it's not sudden it's been happening for years.

482
00:33:22.780 --> 00:33:27.580
I remember one of the opinion leaders as you put it,

483
00:33:27.610 --> 00:33:31.450
who brought down Richard Nixon was Walter Cronkite.

484
00:33:31.990 --> 00:33:34.210
And those of you who are old enough might remember,

485
00:33:34.360 --> 00:33:38.980
he was a news anchor that everybody watched every night.

486
00:33:39.400 --> 00:33:44.380
And in the 1950s one of the people that brought down Senator Joe McCarthy and

487
00:33:44.381 --> 00:33:49.381
his Communist witch hunts was Edward r Murrow who everybody watched and trust.

488
00:33:50.050 --> 00:33:52.480
But now we don't have that kind of person.

489
00:33:53.440 --> 00:33:58.360
And you're raising not only that problem but I ain't even bigger problem.

490
00:33:58.361 --> 00:34:03.361
And that is a democracy is based on truth and it's based on shared facts and

491
00:34:05.471 --> 00:34:09.640
shared analysis.
Not everybody's,
not everybody's gonna agree on every fact,

492
00:34:09.730 --> 00:34:14.170
but at least there is a consensus around some key facts.

493
00:34:14.350 --> 00:34:18.400
If you've got a president who spouts lies,

494
00:34:18.460 --> 00:34:23.460
big lies over and over and over again and criticizes the media for correcting

495
00:34:23.681 --> 00:34:24.514
him.

496
00:34:24.970 --> 00:34:26.950
<v 4>Is he a,
is he a symptom though or was he a cop</v>

497
00:34:27.180 --> 00:34:29.270
<v 0>is both a cause and a symptom.
I mean he's a,
he's a,</v>

498
00:34:29.271 --> 00:34:32.870
he's a symptom of something that has been growing,
but he is.

499
00:34:33.380 --> 00:34:38.380
And what worries me is he is escalating it big time and it's not just

500
00:34:41.750 --> 00:34:46.040
dumping on the media
for criticizing him.

501
00:34:46.100 --> 00:34:50.510
It's also substituting his own direct tweets.

502
00:34:50.960 --> 00:34:55.400
And rallies and saying as he did last week,

503
00:34:55.401 --> 00:34:58.070
and as his press secretary said,

504
00:34:59.360 --> 00:35:01.220
you can't trust the media.

505
00:35:01.340 --> 00:35:06.140
You can only trust trumps direct statements.
Now,

506
00:35:06.141 --> 00:35:08.990
if we ever get to a point,
and I hope to God we don't,

507
00:35:09.410 --> 00:35:13.840
but if we ever got to a point where the independent neutral media and fact

508
00:35:13.841 --> 00:35:16.400
finders and scientists and everybody else,

509
00:35:16.820 --> 00:35:19.460
they are rejected in favor of what a president,

510
00:35:19.520 --> 00:35:22.610
whether it's called Trump or anything else says is the truth,

511
00:35:22.760 --> 00:35:24.140
then that's the end of our democracy,

512
00:35:24.740 --> 00:35:29.740
then there's no way of holding him or anybody in his position ever accountable

513
00:35:29.930 --> 00:35:34.490
again.
And that's part of the attack on democratic institutions.

514
00:35:35.330 --> 00:35:38.190
So,
um,
you know,
immigrants who are

515
00:35:38.220 --> 00:35:41.700
<v 5>skilled and able to,
you know,
it's a difficult to make that transition.</v>

516
00:35:42.000 --> 00:35:44.880
And in the past America was that place open to immigration,

517
00:35:44.940 --> 00:35:48.120
a lot of opportunity and growth.
But you know,
you're saying that we were,

518
00:35:48.510 --> 00:35:49.950
our expectations are going down.

519
00:35:50.070 --> 00:35:54.000
So where are the shiny spots in the world and what are they doing economically

520
00:35:54.001 --> 00:35:56.070
that is different here that maybe they should adopt?

521
00:35:56.480 --> 00:35:57.313
<v 0>Uh,</v>

522
00:35:57.320 --> 00:36:02.320
America has always been a shining example to the rest of the world of a melting

523
00:36:02.561 --> 00:36:03.280
pot.

524
00:36:03.280 --> 00:36:07.960
Anybody can come here and make it and it has attracted some of the most talented

525
00:36:07.961 --> 00:36:11.320
and ambitious people around the world.
And that has been a huge plus.

526
00:36:11.350 --> 00:36:14.640
That's not a zero sum game.
It's a positive sum game.
Uh,

527
00:36:14.810 --> 00:36:19.000
and you ask where around the world,
who is doing it better right now?

528
00:36:19.330 --> 00:36:20.620
And honestly,

529
00:36:20.740 --> 00:36:25.030
I am hard pressed to come up with somebody who was doing it better because we

530
00:36:25.031 --> 00:36:29.320
have something that most other countries don't have.
We have a polyglot culture.

531
00:36:29.350 --> 00:36:32.230
There is not,
I mean there was a tradition of immigration.

532
00:36:32.380 --> 00:36:36.970
Most of us are here because some ancestor migrated here.

533
00:36:37.360 --> 00:36:40.150
That's,
you can't say that about most other countries.

534
00:36:42.200 --> 00:36:43.033
<v 1>Okay.</v>

535
00:36:43.960 --> 00:36:48.640
<v 0>And so when we become nativist,</v>

536
00:36:49.030 --> 00:36:53.320
isolationist,
when we turn our backs on our own tradition,

537
00:36:54.190 --> 00:36:59.190
we are not only losing our economic way because that's a huge cost for us,

538
00:37:00.760 --> 00:37:04.480
but we are also losing the moral authority in the world.

539
00:37:04.630 --> 00:37:09.630
That comes with being the hope of the world in terms of upward mobility.

540
00:37:10.210 --> 00:37:11.590
And on top of that,

541
00:37:11.680 --> 00:37:15.580
unfortunately we have a president who is,

542
00:37:16.210 --> 00:37:19.150
and everybody knows this no matter what he says,

543
00:37:19.300 --> 00:37:23.800
he's declaring war on Muslims around the world.
And I'll tell you something,

544
00:37:23.920 --> 00:37:25.000
if he goes much further,

545
00:37:25.210 --> 00:37:29.620
my recommendation to all of us here in this room and everybody else is we all

546
00:37:29.860 --> 00:37:31.190
convert to Islam.
Okay.

547
00:37:33.320 --> 00:37:38.320
<v 1>[inaudible]</v>

548
00:37:42.890 --> 00:37:44.810
<v 2>artificial intelligence is on the horizon,</v>

549
00:37:45.170 --> 00:37:49.250
but automation and robotics are taking manufacturing jobs right now contributing

550
00:37:49.251 --> 00:37:52.490
to the climate that's allowed for our current president to take office.

551
00:37:52.850 --> 00:37:55.700
What would you recommend to the president or to the next president to

552
00:37:55.701 --> 00:37:57.140
reinvigorate the rust belt?

553
00:37:58.280 --> 00:38:01.840
<v 0>Well,
I'd recommend this to Donald Trump if he ever asked me as well.
Uh,</v>

554
00:38:02.450 --> 00:38:05.660
manufacturing is coming back.
Manufacturing jobs are not,

555
00:38:06.500 --> 00:38:10.100
and that's an important distinction.
There's no way.

556
00:38:10.130 --> 00:38:14.780
Most manufacturing jobs a,
were unionized and B were on the assembly line.

557
00:38:15.440 --> 00:38:18.260
A,
you don't have those big unions anymore be,

558
00:38:18.261 --> 00:38:23.060
you don't have the assembly lines anymore.
So it is a complete farce.

559
00:38:23.090 --> 00:38:24.440
It is a complete lie.

560
00:38:25.040 --> 00:38:30.040
Who assume that getting manufacturing back is the way to restoring the rust

561
00:38:30.521 --> 00:38:31.580
belt.
I mean,

562
00:38:31.581 --> 00:38:36.581
the way to restoring the rustbelt is basically to develop and more tech.

563
00:38:37.420 --> 00:38:41.050
I'm going to call them technician jobs.
These are,

564
00:38:41.440 --> 00:38:42.820
and you don't have to have a college degree.

565
00:38:42.821 --> 00:38:47.821
One of the worst conceits that has infected this country is that the only way

566
00:38:49.151 --> 00:38:52.000
you get in the middle class is having a four year college degree.

567
00:38:52.720 --> 00:38:53.950
That should not be the case.

568
00:38:57.010 --> 00:38:58.300
It is not the case in Germany.

569
00:38:58.301 --> 00:38:59.980
It's not the case in various places around the world.

570
00:38:59.981 --> 00:39:04.981
We have a lot of people in this country who should be able to get a first class

571
00:39:05.340 --> 00:39:08.260
world class,
vocational technical education,

572
00:39:08.410 --> 00:39:13.410
and become technicians who can upgrade and stall and monitor and develop all of

573
00:39:14.351 --> 00:39:16.930
the gadgets that are going everywhere,
into,

574
00:39:17.050 --> 00:39:20.890
into automobiles and into offices and every place else.

575
00:39:21.080 --> 00:39:23.750
And we need these people.
There's a demand for these people.
Uh,

576
00:39:24.010 --> 00:39:29.010
and if somebody has the last two years of high school and maybe the first year,

577
00:39:29.440 --> 00:39:30.710
possibly the fridge,
the lat,

578
00:39:30.790 --> 00:39:35.790
the next two years of some sort of a community college and get mastery of AU

579
00:39:37.151 --> 00:39:42.151
domain of knowledge that enables them to thereby learn on the job thereafter.

580
00:39:43.870 --> 00:39:47.470
Those are and could be terrific jobs in the future,

581
00:39:48.250 --> 00:39:50.770
but we're not doing it.
We should be.

582
00:39:51.680 --> 00:39:55.040
<v 6>Earlier you were talking about the earned income tax credit and it's not</v>

583
00:39:55.041 --> 00:39:56.120
sufficient.
Um,

584
00:39:56.150 --> 00:39:59.420
could you talk about what's wrong with it and explain it in the problems?

585
00:39:59.850 --> 00:40:03.810
<v 0>The earned income tax credit,
uh,
the three problems are,
it's not big enough.</v>

586
00:40:03.840 --> 00:40:08.080
That is an ought to be both larger and it also,
it's,

587
00:40:08.310 --> 00:40:12.180
it needs to extend higher into the end of the,
on the income ladder.

588
00:40:12.840 --> 00:40:16.440
Number two,
it's paid in a lump sum once a year,

589
00:40:16.920 --> 00:40:21.540
which makes no sense at all because it's very hard for people to utilize a lump

590
00:40:21.541 --> 00:40:21.930
sum.

591
00:40:21.930 --> 00:40:26.930
It needs to be paid weekly or monthly as part of your regular job.

592
00:40:27.270 --> 00:40:30.720
If you have a regular job or even if you have a,
a,
you know,

593
00:40:30.750 --> 00:40:34.020
even if your job was part time,
you want to be able to get it regularly.

594
00:40:34.270 --> 00:40:36.510
And thirdly,
most people,
many people,

595
00:40:36.511 --> 00:40:40.350
but half the people who are entitled to the earned income tax credit don't even

596
00:40:40.351 --> 00:40:43.920
know they're entitled.
And so there's a big industry,
uh,

597
00:40:43.921 --> 00:40:48.900
that Raikes off a lot of that earned income tax credit by saying that some

598
00:40:49.710 --> 00:40:53.550
usually poor person who's entitled to it.
Look at,
you're entitled to something.

599
00:40:53.551 --> 00:40:54.750
I can get you,
uh,

600
00:40:54.751 --> 00:40:58.800
just sign here and basically they're signing away a third to a half of the

601
00:40:58.801 --> 00:41:03.210
earned income tax credit.
This is ridiculous.
It's a very important program.

602
00:41:03.300 --> 00:41:06.810
It's the,
as I said,
it's the largest antipoverty program.

603
00:41:06.811 --> 00:41:09.540
We have conservatives like it,
it's a,

604
00:41:09.570 --> 00:41:13.530
it Milton Friedman invented it for crying out loud.

605
00:41:14.510 --> 00:41:17.820
Uh,
but it needs to be administered much better.

606
00:41:17.821 --> 00:41:22.190
And this is something else you all can help with in terms of making it easy.
Uh,

607
00:41:22.230 --> 00:41:22.411
you know,

608
00:41:22.411 --> 00:41:27.411
if there is an APP that a poor person can use to find out everything that they

609
00:41:28.201 --> 00:41:31.940
are entitled to,
Food Stamps,
earned income,
tax credit,
uh,

610
00:41:32.100 --> 00:41:36.640
easily is,
and they can just,
they can easily apply and they,

611
00:41:36.760 --> 00:41:41.090
they can get what they need.
Uh,
and a transparent,
that would be fabulous.

612
00:41:41.890 --> 00:41:45.130
<v 2>Thank you for highlighting and be increasing lopsided distribution of wealth</v>

613
00:41:45.670 --> 00:41:46.840
with artificial intelligence.

614
00:41:46.841 --> 00:41:50.110
Don't we see an even greater concentration of wealth to those who develop our

615
00:41:50.111 --> 00:41:50.944
overlords,

616
00:41:52.750 --> 00:41:56.020
especially since it will likely encroach into the higher paying knowledge slash

617
00:41:56.021 --> 00:41:59.940
service industries.
There's a Hashtag you were up at all.
Avoid ruining it.

618
00:42:02.120 --> 00:42:06.410
<v 0>Uh,
okay.
Well this is,
I mean,</v>

619
00:42:06.800 --> 00:42:08.570
look,
we all understand.

620
00:42:08.571 --> 00:42:13.571
I think that the reason that more and more income and wealth is being

621
00:42:15.471 --> 00:42:20.471
concentrated is not just because the market is organized that way or it's not

622
00:42:22.311 --> 00:42:25.790
inevitable.
Let's put it this way.
Some people say,
well,
it's just market forces.

623
00:42:26.030 --> 00:42:28.450
Well,
there's no inevitability around market force.
It's about,

624
00:42:28.850 --> 00:42:32.930
the question is always,
how is the market designed and who designs the market?

625
00:42:33.980 --> 00:42:37.040
And the issue with regard to a lot of,

626
00:42:37.041 --> 00:42:40.430
whether we're talking about artificial intelligence or any other kind of

627
00:42:40.550 --> 00:42:45.550
technology has a lot to do with patents and copyrights and trademarks and

628
00:42:47.900 --> 00:42:49.340
intellectual property in general.

629
00:42:49.580 --> 00:42:54.410
Intellectual Property Law doesn't have to be exactly the way it's now designed.

630
00:42:54.930 --> 00:42:58.370
Oh,
if anybody was,
who's an intellectual property expert here knows?

631
00:42:58.550 --> 00:43:00.830
And I'm not certainly not accusing Google of anything,

632
00:43:00.980 --> 00:43:05.980
but you know that the length of time of a patent or a trademark or a copyright

633
00:43:06.800 --> 00:43:08.780
continues to lengthen.

634
00:43:10.110 --> 00:43:10.700
<v 1>Okay.</v>

635
00:43:10.700 --> 00:43:13.580
<v 0>And with,
for example,
pharmaceuticals.</v>

636
00:43:14.330 --> 00:43:19.330
And I think in certain other industries you now have the ability of companies to

637
00:43:20.301 --> 00:43:25.301
lengthen those patents or copyrights or trademarks almost infinitely on the

638
00:43:25.701 --> 00:43:29.960
basis of very small cosmetic changes.
And if you have a fleet of,

639
00:43:30.080 --> 00:43:35.080
of attorneys willing to go to court to support you and to accuse anybody else

640
00:43:37.811 --> 00:43:41.960
and patent infringement or copyright infringement,
well you've got it made.

641
00:43:43.100 --> 00:43:48.100
So all I am suggesting is that there is nothing inevitable about intellectual

642
00:43:50.931 --> 00:43:51.770
property.

643
00:43:51.920 --> 00:43:56.920
That means that wealth has got to be concentrated that much and the hands of the

644
00:43:57.531 --> 00:43:59.810
owners of the intellectual property.
I think we would,

645
00:43:59.870 --> 00:44:04.870
we would have as much if not maybe more innovation if maybe

646
00:44:07.540 --> 00:44:08.110
<v 1>okay.</v>

647
00:44:08.110 --> 00:44:13.110
<v 0>The Holders of some of those intellectual property patents didn't have as much</v>

648
00:44:13.990 --> 00:44:18.310
of a return on those patents.
You understand what I'm getting at?

649
00:44:19.690 --> 00:44:21.780
We are making choices.
Inequality.

650
00:44:21.790 --> 00:44:25.360
The degree of inequality we have now is a choice.

651
00:44:25.990 --> 00:44:30.990
It's the reflection of public choices that have been made over last,

652
00:44:31.471 --> 00:44:36.150
particularly the last 35 years
in every domain.

653
00:44:36.870 --> 00:44:39.420
Not just intellectual property,
but also antitrust.

654
00:44:39.570 --> 00:44:43.740
Also areas having to do with insider information.

655
00:44:43.860 --> 00:44:48.860
No other country in the advanced world has as lacks a system of insider trading

656
00:44:54.780 --> 00:44:55.613
as we do.

657
00:44:56.730 --> 00:45:01.730
And that creates a gigantic fortunes for those who have access in turn to that

658
00:45:02.730 --> 00:45:03.870
insider information,

659
00:45:03.990 --> 00:45:08.990
not because they are superior human beings or because they have any particular

660
00:45:09.601 --> 00:45:14.601
expertise except they played golf with the right people.

661
00:45:19.570 --> 00:45:19.960
<v 7>Uh,</v>

662
00:45:19.960 --> 00:45:23.500
I have to deleted questions regarding the notion of kids doing better than their

663
00:45:23.501 --> 00:45:26.650
parents did.
Reminds me of a quote from the book.

664
00:45:26.651 --> 00:45:31.480
Small is beautiful economics as if people mattered and that they talk about how

665
00:45:31.481 --> 00:45:35.020
can you have infinite growth when you have a limited set of resources,
right?

666
00:45:35.021 --> 00:45:38.650
The world's emitted.
And so kids doing better than their parents,

667
00:45:38.740 --> 00:45:43.690
generation after generation sounds like something that's akin to infinite
growth.

668
00:45:44.380 --> 00:45:49.130
And the next thing is,
um,
when we talk about guaranteed minimum income,
um,

669
00:45:50.050 --> 00:45:53.890
how do we get the kids doing better than their parents?
Um,
notion.
Um,

670
00:45:54.040 --> 00:45:59.040
especially if kids don't want to work and they're happy with the minimum income,

671
00:46:00.250 --> 00:46:02.830
but feel entitled that they should be doing better than their parents.

672
00:46:04.060 --> 00:46:07.810
<v 0>Well,
let me first of all,
deal with,
uh,
the growth issue.
I mean,</v>

673
00:46:07.811 --> 00:46:12.811
everybody who works for Google must understand that technology and innovation

674
00:46:13.751 --> 00:46:18.751
generate growth and there's no limit necessarily to the human brain's capacity

675
00:46:19.780 --> 00:46:24.550
to innovate.
And so there's no reason we can't continue to grow.
I mean,

676
00:46:24.640 --> 00:46:28.300
those people who are nervous about growth,

677
00:46:28.301 --> 00:46:31.030
what they really are nervous about is excessive,

678
00:46:31.120 --> 00:46:36.070
wasteful consumption and basically people filling up their homeless full of

679
00:46:36.071 --> 00:46:41.020
stuff that is generating a,
just waste and more utilization of,
of,

680
00:46:41.070 --> 00:46:45.640
of fossil fuels.
But innovation,
real innovation can,

681
00:46:45.670 --> 00:46:47.740
and I'm talking to the converted here,
you know,

682
00:46:47.770 --> 00:46:51.340
innovation can allow us all healthier,
happier,

683
00:46:51.370 --> 00:46:55.450
better lives,
can save energy,

684
00:46:55.490 --> 00:47:00.270
can save the environment.
I mean,
it's,

685
00:47:00.520 --> 00:47:03.610
growth is not a zero sum game and it's not a,

686
00:47:03.730 --> 00:47:08.730
a declining amount of possibility if everybody's on a guaranteed minimum income.

687
00:47:09.730 --> 00:47:14.470
How can children do better than their parents?
Well,
to two points.

688
00:47:14.471 --> 00:47:16.360
Number one,
doing better.

689
00:47:16.500 --> 00:47:20.470
It does not necessarily mean simply more acquisitiveness or more,

690
00:47:20.620 --> 00:47:24.970
it could be a more creative options for how you use your time.

691
00:47:25.420 --> 00:47:29.730
And if technology continues to improve that,
uh,

692
00:47:30.010 --> 00:47:32.200
just sort a portfolio of options,

693
00:47:32.201 --> 00:47:35.290
they then people will be doing better by definition.

694
00:47:36.080 --> 00:47:38.090
<v 2>So it's a similar answer for both of them.</v>

695
00:47:38.120 --> 00:47:40.730
Sounds like tech similar answer to both of them.
And again,

696
00:47:41.330 --> 00:47:45.650
I would have you are all in this room understand those answers better than any

697
00:47:45.651 --> 00:47:50.060
audience when you talk about a universal basic income or are you imagining one

698
00:47:50.061 --> 00:47:52.400
for the entire us or for the entire world?

699
00:47:53.050 --> 00:47:56.030
Why do you focus on whichever of these you focus on and is there anything

700
00:47:56.031 --> 00:47:57.470
positive you can say about the other one?

701
00:48:00.320 --> 00:48:00.650
<v 0>Well,</v>

702
00:48:00.650 --> 00:48:05.650
the universal basic income is the kind of thing that has to be financed and it

703
00:48:07.221 --> 00:48:09.620
has to be financed.
And there are certain beneficiaries,

704
00:48:09.830 --> 00:48:13.460
the obviously unit is a society or a nation.

705
00:48:13.640 --> 00:48:16.340
Now a lot of nations can have it.
I mean we have,

706
00:48:16.660 --> 00:48:19.610
or the earned income tax credit or the equivalent of the earned income tax

707
00:48:19.611 --> 00:48:23.660
credit does now in eight developing nations or developed nations.

708
00:48:23.661 --> 00:48:25.460
I should say and it's spreading a,

709
00:48:25.461 --> 00:48:29.380
there's no reason that the universal basic income could not also be,
uh,

710
00:48:29.420 --> 00:48:33.140
now the interesting question is,
and I think it's raised by that question,

711
00:48:33.770 --> 00:48:38.540
could we have a universal basic income that was global?

712
00:48:38.690 --> 00:48:38.961
I mean,

713
00:48:38.961 --> 00:48:43.220
is there any reason why developing decisions or developing nations should not

714
00:48:43.221 --> 00:48:48.221
have something like that and could it be possibly subsidized by rich nations?

715
00:48:49.430 --> 00:48:53.540
I suppose that is possible.
That would be wonderful.
But I would,

716
00:48:53.541 --> 00:48:58.150
I think we have to at least establish the universal basic income first,
uh,

717
00:48:58.250 --> 00:49:01.730
before we start pushing it in that direction.

718
00:49:02.000 --> 00:49:03.470
It's going to be hard enough.

719
00:49:03.980 --> 00:49:07.190
But let me tie this back if I make us,

720
00:49:07.370 --> 00:49:10.880
because we only have a couple of minutes left and I want to tie it back to

721
00:49:10.881 --> 00:49:12.200
something that I said initially.

722
00:49:13.340 --> 00:49:18.340
We are right now in a crisis in terms of our democracy and also to some extent

723
00:49:20.810 --> 00:49:25.810
in terms of the conditions that led to our democratic small d crisis.

724
00:49:26.990 --> 00:49:28.370
There is a silver lining.

725
00:49:28.490 --> 00:49:33.490
The silver lining is that more people are more engaged right now politically.

726
00:49:36.590 --> 00:49:40.370
Then I have seen in my memory at least since the Vietnam War,

727
00:49:42.410 --> 00:49:44.750
and that is a great

728
00:49:45.110 --> 00:49:45.943
<v 1>thanks.</v>

729
00:49:50.250 --> 00:49:55.250
<v 0>That degree of engagement does not simply mean demonstrations,</v>

730
00:49:55.351 --> 00:49:59.730
although demonstrations are great and they're important and they also can be
fun.

731
00:50:00.310 --> 00:50:00.720
Uh,

732
00:50:00.720 --> 00:50:05.720
and they're important partly because they convince people or they help reassure

733
00:50:05.791 --> 00:50:07.350
people that they're not alone,

734
00:50:07.530 --> 00:50:10.110
that there are millions of other people who feel exactly as they do,

735
00:50:11.060 --> 00:50:16.060
but they can't be the end of what people do because those demonstrations have

736
00:50:17.611 --> 00:50:22.611
got to be part of a very pragmatic political strategy.

737
00:50:24.740 --> 00:50:27.800
Uh,
and that is,
it seems to be the next question.

738
00:50:28.700 --> 00:50:33.350
Those of you who have got a hold of indivisible,

739
00:50:33.380 --> 00:50:38.380
guide.com and also sister district got.com.

740
00:50:39.830 --> 00:50:44.830
There are a bunch of very useful websites right now about what you can do and

741
00:50:46.911 --> 00:50:49.170
how you can do it.
Uh,

742
00:50:49.460 --> 00:50:52.790
and I think that we are ideally,

743
00:50:52.820 --> 00:50:57.320
and again this is silver lining stuff than I am.
I am deep down an optimist.

744
00:50:57.890 --> 00:51:02.890
I think we are maybe going to get to see a renewal of civic engagement and civic

745
00:51:03.081 --> 00:51:05.780
activism such as again,

746
00:51:06.260 --> 00:51:08.690
we haven't seen but we desperately need.

747
00:51:08.840 --> 00:51:10.940
We would have needed even without Donald Trump,

748
00:51:11.420 --> 00:51:16.420
but unfortunately we have Trump and maybe we would not get this kind of activism

749
00:51:18.921 --> 00:51:20.530
without them though.

750
00:51:20.540 --> 00:51:24.350
My question to you would be if you could speak to the challenges of gender in

751
00:51:24.351 --> 00:51:28.210
both politics and technology.
Uh,
the challenge of the,

752
00:51:28.211 --> 00:51:29.760
the biggest immediate

753
00:51:29.940 --> 00:51:33.660
<v 1>[inaudible],</v>

754
00:51:33.850 --> 00:51:38.850
<v 0>the biggest immediate challenge with regard to gender right now,</v>

755
00:51:40.100 --> 00:51:44.540
right now as we stand here is the assault on women's reproductive rights.

756
00:51:44.660 --> 00:51:46.010
It is major,

757
00:51:46.140 --> 00:51:51.050
it is going on all over this country and it is taking shape very,

758
00:51:51.051 --> 00:51:54.650
very rapidly.
A lot of you women here,

759
00:51:54.860 --> 00:51:57.020
you take Roe v Wade for granted.

760
00:51:57.740 --> 00:52:00.980
I was alive before Roe against Wade.

761
00:52:01.490 --> 00:52:03.500
I saw what happened.

762
00:52:05.030 --> 00:52:08.240
The result is not fewer abortions.

763
00:52:08.690 --> 00:52:13.690
The result is more deaths and maimings and serious injuries and I think that

764
00:52:18.051 --> 00:52:23.000
that to me is something that is not just a woman's issue.
It is a men's issue,

765
00:52:23.120 --> 00:52:24.320
is a family issue.

766
00:52:24.500 --> 00:52:29.500
We all have to get behind protecting roe against Wade and a women's right to

767
00:52:30.921 --> 00:52:34.130
choose.
Uh,
secondly,

768
00:52:34.160 --> 00:52:37.430
with regard to technology and women,
let me just say this,

769
00:52:37.730 --> 00:52:42.280
I worked with a fellow for a number of years named Larry Summers.
Uh,

770
00:52:42.650 --> 00:52:47.650
he was president of Harvard University for a time until he made the preposterous

771
00:52:51.080 --> 00:52:56.080
statements that maybe women's brains are not really suited for math and

772
00:52:59.391 --> 00:53:01.530
technology,
uh,

773
00:53:01.550 --> 00:53:06.550
that lead appropriately to him no longer being president of Harvard.

774
00:53:07.820 --> 00:53:12.820
I think that there is no reason that women should not be as plentiful in this

775
00:53:14.661 --> 00:53:15.920
audience as men.

776
00:53:16.670 --> 00:53:21.060
And this is not believed me in any way directly or indirectly a criticism of,

777
00:53:21.061 --> 00:53:25.160
of Google.
I just mean women should be in technology.

778
00:53:26.880 --> 00:53:29.130
And what we see,

779
00:53:29.131 --> 00:53:32.520
and I teach at one of the best universities in this country,

780
00:53:33.420 --> 00:53:36.210
my students are more than half of them are women.

781
00:53:36.600 --> 00:53:38.490
And my best students are all women

782
00:53:41.670 --> 00:53:42.630
not to stereotype.

783
00:53:44.730 --> 00:53:49.730
So I think that women have got to be encouraged to go into math and science and

784
00:53:51.451 --> 00:53:55.020
technology and it's all of our responsibilities.

785
00:53:56.490 --> 00:54:01.020
Uh,
on that note,
upbeat as it is,

786
00:54:01.590 --> 00:54:04.860
I want to thank you for your time and attention.
The reason,

787
00:54:04.890 --> 00:54:09.120
let me just say the reason I accepted your very kind invitation to come today is

788
00:54:09.121 --> 00:54:12.990
because I really feel that,

789
00:54:13.560 --> 00:54:14.580
as I said at the start,

790
00:54:14.730 --> 00:54:19.470
you have not only a part of the responsibility for what's happening in this

791
00:54:19.471 --> 00:54:22.020
country now,
but also a big part of the solution.

792
00:54:22.950 --> 00:54:27.900
And I hope I have made myself clear about some of the directions that solution

793
00:54:28.050 --> 00:54:33.030
needs to move in.
A one final point on that notion,

794
00:54:33.480 --> 00:54:35.940
not only in terms of technology and technological development,

795
00:54:36.360 --> 00:54:38.880
I do hope that Google,

796
00:54:38.881 --> 00:54:43.881
as well as other big high tech companies become very clear and articulate in

797
00:54:47.551 --> 00:54:52.551
their opposition to what is happening in this country with regard to Nativism,

798
00:54:54.280 --> 00:54:57.960
xenophobia,
and also an attack on democratic institutions.

799
00:54:58.240 --> 00:55:03.240
<v 1>[inaudible].</v>
