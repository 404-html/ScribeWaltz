1
00:00:08.520 --> 00:00:10.680
Okay.
Welcome everybody.
Welcome to toxic Google.

2
00:00:10.681 --> 00:00:15.480
We're coming to you live from the Google plex in Tunis and everybody out there

3
00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:20.040
in live stream land.
We're going to be talking about Claude Shannon today.

4
00:00:20.041 --> 00:00:21.080
Someone that made,

5
00:00:21.081 --> 00:00:25.020
many of you may know in many of you may not know about machines,

6
00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:26.690
machines to play chess machines.

7
00:00:26.691 --> 00:00:31.020
The juggle all machines that the our flame throwing trumpets and yeah,

8
00:00:31.021 --> 00:00:32.820
how about the curation of information theory?

9
00:00:33.060 --> 00:00:37.320
It's all about Claude Shannon and he's one of the most important pioneers of

10
00:00:37.321 --> 00:00:40.740
computer science and our digital age that most of us barely know about,

11
00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:45.690
but no longer because Jimmy Sony and Rob Goodman have written this book,

12
00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:46.560
the full full,

13
00:00:46.560 --> 00:00:51.560
the first full biography of Claude Shannon and they're here today to talk to us

14
00:00:51.631 --> 00:00:54.150
about it.
So come on in.
Welcome Jimmy and rob

15
00:00:54.430 --> 00:00:59.430
<v 1>[inaudible].</v>

16
00:01:03.820 --> 00:01:06.640
<v 0>Okay.
So let's start briefly,</v>

17
00:01:06.641 --> 00:01:09.130
can you describe why Claude Shannon is so important?

18
00:01:09.131 --> 00:01:12.010
Why we should care about them and what were his major contributions?

19
00:01:12.650 --> 00:01:15.950
<v 2>Oh yeah,
I take it away.
Wow.
Um,</v>

20
00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:19.190
so I think Claude Shannon was important for a couple of reasons and obviously we

21
00:01:19.191 --> 00:01:21.860
don't need to tell this crowd,
uh,
why he made such a big difference.

22
00:01:21.861 --> 00:01:24.340
But we sort of wrote the book,
uh,

23
00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:29.300
in a sense to do is think about the gratitude that we have a does someone like

24
00:01:29.301 --> 00:01:31.790
Claude Shannon who was responsible for so much of the technology.
We're a lot,

25
00:01:31.791 --> 00:01:33.070
we rely on every day,
uh,

26
00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:37.520
scientifically we think that is too big accomplishments where his,
uh,

27
00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:40.230
1937 masters thesis where he,
uh,

28
00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:43.570
does an important job of laying the foundations of digital computing of Zeros

29
00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:44.950
and ones.
And a,

30
00:01:44.951 --> 00:01:49.240
a big part of that accomplishment was showing the connection between,
um,

31
00:01:49.620 --> 00:01:54.620
a boolean logic and the relays or switches that were a part of computing

32
00:01:54.831 --> 00:01:58.940
systems.
And Shannon got his start working on a giant analog computing systems,

33
00:01:58.941 --> 00:02:03.920
but he really did a lot to,
uh,
uncover the potential of a digital systems.
Uh,

34
00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:05.960
Chris Dixon road and rate piece about this and the Atlantic.

35
00:02:05.961 --> 00:02:08.680
And we read a couple of days ago.
Um,
and the way he put it,

36
00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:11.530
I thought was really evocative and I wish we could stolen this for our book.
Uh,

37
00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:12.441
he says that,

38
00:02:12.441 --> 00:02:15.980
that Shane had thought about how to map logic on fiscal world and that,

39
00:02:15.981 --> 00:02:18.410
I think that's a really succinct way of putting it.
Um,

40
00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:20.840
the other big contribution by the way,
he was just 21,

41
00:02:20.841 --> 00:02:24.680
so it makes me feel like crap.
I'm already 33.
I'm not gonna live up to that,

42
00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:29.780
but anyway,
at 32,
which is still younger than me,
um,
uh,
Shannon,

43
00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:33.700
uh,
releases what a lot of people consider it as masterpiece,
which again,

44
00:02:33.701 --> 00:02:36.410
in this crowd probably knows very well about it says mathematical theory of

45
00:02:36.411 --> 00:02:39.440
communication,
uh,
in 1948,
um,

46
00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:42.620
which does a number of things like exploring the properties that communication

47
00:02:42.621 --> 00:02:44.000
systems have in common,
uh,

48
00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:47.270
coming up with the concept of the bit to objectively quantify information.

49
00:02:47.570 --> 00:02:51.030
And then of course,
coming up with those,
uh,
digital codes to,
uh,

50
00:02:51.070 --> 00:02:54.830
to compress information and also to accurately transmit information in a noisy

51
00:02:54.831 --> 00:02:57.320
channel.
Um,
and,
uh,

52
00:02:57.321 --> 00:03:00.490
the reaction to this was just a remarkable John Pierce who we were talking a

53
00:03:00.491 --> 00:03:01.860
little bit about before we went on and say it,

54
00:03:01.861 --> 00:03:05.680
it came as a bomb and that we called the chapter on Shannon's,
uh,
communications.

55
00:03:05.681 --> 00:03:09.040
Uh,
he is,
uh,
information theory paper,
the bomb,
because that,

56
00:03:09.041 --> 00:03:12.730
that's the kind of impact of course it had in the science engineering community.

57
00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:13.593
And,
uh,

58
00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:18.660
we were sort of setting out to explore why this matters for our lives now and

59
00:03:20.321 --> 00:03:24.070
why people even without a science or math or engineering background ought to

60
00:03:24.071 --> 00:03:28.540
know what information theory is and what information theory makes possible.
Um,

61
00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:32.050
and do a little justice to Shannon who deserves a little more name recognition.

62
00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:37.100
<v 0>Thanks.
Now neither of you are computer scientists or mathematicians.
Oh,</v>

63
00:03:37.101 --> 00:03:38.790
you got us our sugar and yeah.

64
00:03:38.820 --> 00:03:42.170
So can you tell us a little bit about your backgrounds and how did you learn

65
00:03:42.171 --> 00:03:44.080
about Shannon?
You come to write about him?

66
00:03:44.330 --> 00:03:49.330
So I had been gifted a book called the idea factory by a friend.

67
00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:52.970
Uh,
and the book is by a guy named John Gardner was,
became it,

68
00:03:52.971 --> 00:03:56.900
became a close advisor to us is we were doing this project and the idea factory,

69
00:03:57.380 --> 00:04:02.330
is it a narrative history of bell labs.
Um,
w the way we joke about it,

70
00:04:02.420 --> 00:04:06.410
and this is not meant as an offense to anybody in the room,
but the,
we call it,

71
00:04:06.411 --> 00:04:11.010
we said if,
if you could envision a freak merger of Google,
apple and Facebook,
uh,

72
00:04:11.030 --> 00:04:13.110
that was bell labs in the 20th century.
Um,

73
00:04:13.310 --> 00:04:17.690
it was the second largest employer in the country after the federal government.

74
00:04:18.020 --> 00:04:22.430
Uh,
it,
it was,
it had a,
basically a government back of monopoly,
uh,

75
00:04:22.431 --> 00:04:27.000
ownership over the telephone system.
So had an enormous resources,
um,

76
00:04:27.050 --> 00:04:28.660
and in a way,
you know,
it,
it,

77
00:04:28.750 --> 00:04:32.660
it embraced a lot of what the people in this room embrace,
uh,
in the sense that,

78
00:04:32.840 --> 00:04:33.060
you know,

79
00:04:33.060 --> 00:04:36.380
it gave people a remarkable freedom and flexibility to do different kinds of

80
00:04:36.381 --> 00:04:37.214
work.
Um,

81
00:04:37.250 --> 00:04:40.430
Shannon was actually a part of something called the mathematical research group.

82
00:04:40.730 --> 00:04:44.870
We're,
we're basically,
it was a group for all the misfits within bell labs.

83
00:04:44.871 --> 00:04:46.010
They didn't know where else to put them,

84
00:04:46.011 --> 00:04:48.830
so they would assign them to a man named Thornton fry.

85
00:04:48.831 --> 00:04:52.310
And he built what was essentially an in house consulting organization,

86
00:04:52.520 --> 00:04:55.850
but it was a consulting organization where they got to pick the projects they

87
00:04:55.851 --> 00:04:59.240
worked on and didn't have to work on anything they didn't want to work on.
Uh,

88
00:04:59.241 --> 00:05:02.180
and so he was a part of this incredible group of PhDs.

89
00:05:02.480 --> 00:05:05.930
And what it gave bell labs was this,
this just unbelievable source of talent.

90
00:05:06.500 --> 00:05:09.800
And it gave them six Nobel prizes credit for,
you know,

91
00:05:09.810 --> 00:05:12.170
co-invented the laser inventing the fax machine,

92
00:05:12.350 --> 00:05:14.210
sending the first long distance phone call,

93
00:05:14.240 --> 00:05:17.480
sending the first longest since television transmission.
Uh Oh,

94
00:05:17.481 --> 00:05:19.400
the transistor came out of bell labs.

95
00:05:20.090 --> 00:05:24.170
So this book is an extraordinary look at that place and the people within it and

96
00:05:24.171 --> 00:05:26.780
one of the people whose profile throughout the book as Claude Shannon,

97
00:05:27.080 --> 00:05:30.410
and you get him in bits and pieces because it's not his biography,

98
00:05:30.411 --> 00:05:34.220
it's a story of the company.
And so you get his story weaved in with others.

99
00:05:34.250 --> 00:05:38.510
And I sort of went looking,
uh,
for a biography of Shannon and I did,

100
00:05:38.540 --> 00:05:41.780
I didn't really find one that,
that covered his life end to end.

101
00:05:42.170 --> 00:05:45.920
And I said to myself,
this just seems like something that the,

102
00:05:45.921 --> 00:05:49.370
it just seems crazy to me that this guy's fingerprints are all over the modern

103
00:05:49.371 --> 00:05:52.640
world,
that,
that people in this room 50,

104
00:05:52.641 --> 00:05:57.620
60 years later work on things that he worked on or pioneered and that we don't

105
00:05:57.621 --> 00:06:00.950
have the faintest [inaudible] much of the public doesn't have any sense of who

106
00:06:00.951 --> 00:06:05.030
he is.
Not only that,
even the people like you who might know who he is,

107
00:06:05.180 --> 00:06:08.630
don't necessarily know the details of his personal life or of his early life or

108
00:06:08.650 --> 00:06:10.140
his education.
Uh,

109
00:06:10.190 --> 00:06:13.490
rob and I are old friends from Duke and we've done a lot of writing together and

110
00:06:13.491 --> 00:06:15.920
a lot of writing separately.
And our first book was a book.

111
00:06:16.100 --> 00:06:18.170
What's a look at the ancient Roman Senator Cato.

112
00:06:18.560 --> 00:06:22.070
And we were both kind of kicking around for another project and when I came,

113
00:06:22.071 --> 00:06:24.290
when it came to this,
I just sort of send it to rob.
I,
it's like,

114
00:06:24.560 --> 00:06:27.830
we could do something here.
Like you and I are not engineers.

115
00:06:27.831 --> 00:06:29.480
We're not computer scientists are not mathematicians.

116
00:06:29.600 --> 00:06:33.410
But that's exactly the reason that we ought to do this because if we can make

117
00:06:33.411 --> 00:06:37.100
this accessible to people,
uh,
we're going to have,
in order to do that,

118
00:06:37.130 --> 00:06:40.640
we're going to have to learn all this stuff from scratch and try to make people

119
00:06:40.641 --> 00:06:44.530
understand why he was important.
And we pitched the project to,
um,

120
00:06:44.690 --> 00:06:47.330
Simon and Schuster to an editor and writer named Alice Mayhew,

121
00:06:47.720 --> 00:06:50.660
whose name you don't know,
but you know the name of the people she works with.

122
00:06:50.870 --> 00:06:54.920
Walter Isaacson,
a Sylvia Nasir,
who's the author of a beautiful mind.

123
00:06:55.190 --> 00:06:58.790
And so she understood right away what this book was,
which is,

124
00:06:58.880 --> 00:07:02.660
it's in part the story of a life,
uh,
Claude Shannon's life from beginning to end.

125
00:07:02.840 --> 00:07:04.850
And it's in part a story of discovery.

126
00:07:05.090 --> 00:07:09.140
What does it take for a mind to produce the kinds of things that Claude Shannon

127
00:07:09.141 --> 00:07:13.100
produced.
Um,
she understood that because that is what a beautiful mind was.
Uh,

128
00:07:13.101 --> 00:07:15.800
that is what Walter Isaacson's book on an Einstein was.
A,

129
00:07:15.801 --> 00:07:19.040
there's a really wonderful book called Tuxedo Park,
uh,

130
00:07:19.041 --> 00:07:21.380
which a few people in this room have probably looked at.
But,
uh,

131
00:07:21.381 --> 00:07:23.840
another look at someone,
Alfred Lee Loomis,

132
00:07:23.841 --> 00:07:28.430
who is this character who funded a lot of wartime physics,
but she got,
she,

133
00:07:28.431 --> 00:07:29.900
she just knew the model for the book.

134
00:07:29.930 --> 00:07:32.330
We approached her because I'm interested in like the idea and we were off to the

135
00:07:32.331 --> 00:07:37.100
races.
It was quite a leap from Keto to computers.
Well it was nice working with,

136
00:07:37.101 --> 00:07:39.430
with a figure who is relatively more recent history.

137
00:07:39.440 --> 00:07:41.240
We could talk to his friends and his loved ones.

138
00:07:41.241 --> 00:07:43.750
A Cato was a bit more impenetrable in that way.
Yeah.

139
00:07:43.800 --> 00:07:46.580
You are both trained as journalists.
Just just briefly,

140
00:07:46.581 --> 00:07:49.850
what are your current positions now?
Sure.
So,
uh,
I'm an author,

141
00:07:49.851 --> 00:07:51.560
I'm also an editor at the New York observer

142
00:07:51.750 --> 00:07:55.470
<v 2>and I'm a PHD candidate in Colombia.
My in my day job is in political theory.</v>

143
00:07:55.840 --> 00:07:59.460
Great.
Okay.
So let's talk a little bit about Shannon's life.
Uh,

144
00:08:00.120 --> 00:08:03.210
what about his early years where he grew up,
his parents,
his teachers,

145
00:08:03.211 --> 00:08:06.510
other influences before he left home?
Yeah.
So Shannon grows up in this,

146
00:08:06.511 --> 00:08:10.620
a tiny town called the Gaylord Michigan,
uh,
2000 or 3000 people.

147
00:08:10.830 --> 00:08:13.890
And one of my personal favorite that research gets we did for this book was

148
00:08:13.891 --> 00:08:17.420
looking at the Gaylord,
a newspaper archives from the 19,
uh,

149
00:08:17.670 --> 00:08:19.230
tens and twenties that are online,

150
00:08:19.231 --> 00:08:20.720
but they actually digitize their whole newspapers.

151
00:08:20.721 --> 00:08:21.720
So you can read the whole thing.

152
00:08:22.140 --> 00:08:23.900
And it's the kind of town where the headlines are.

153
00:08:23.910 --> 00:08:26.550
Things like Vern mass loses finger,
um,

154
00:08:26.610 --> 00:08:31.560
meeting called to discuss artichokes and a girl kills wolf with broomstick.

155
00:08:31.830 --> 00:08:35.460
So I tried to be pretty awesome and she needs a book.
Um,

156
00:08:36.030 --> 00:08:38.850
but that was the kind of town that it was.
Um,

157
00:08:38.910 --> 00:08:41.610
so the cool thing about it was that,
uh,
you know,

158
00:08:41.611 --> 00:08:43.670
Shannon didn't have any kind of a tortured,

159
00:08:43.740 --> 00:08:46.230
tormented childhood like some a geniuses did,

160
00:08:46.500 --> 00:08:48.930
but he had a channel to hood where he could,
uh,

161
00:08:49.080 --> 00:08:51.000
play with things and make things and build things.

162
00:08:51.001 --> 00:08:53.670
And you sort of this tradition then did Gertner also talks about in bell labs

163
00:08:53.671 --> 00:08:57.620
with these kind of,
uh,
great Midwestern inventor tinkerer,

164
00:08:57.630 --> 00:09:02.610
scientist engineers who come out of the early 20th century in often many small

165
00:09:02.611 --> 00:09:05.610
towns in the Midwest.
Um,
and one thing that we were able to,

166
00:09:05.790 --> 00:09:09.390
to talk about the book and the research and a little more detail worthy projects

167
00:09:09.391 --> 00:09:11.530
that Shannon tinkered on as a boy.
Um,

168
00:09:11.910 --> 00:09:15.330
one of the coolest was he made a barbed wire telephone network that ran between

169
00:09:15.420 --> 00:09:19.560
his house and his best friend's house.
Um,
and this was not a unique to Shannon.

170
00:09:20.250 --> 00:09:21.540
Um,
there were lots of,
uh,

171
00:09:21.690 --> 00:09:24.540
sort of off the grid places that didn't have major telephone coverage and

172
00:09:24.541 --> 00:09:26.410
farmers would speak to one another,
um,

173
00:09:26.640 --> 00:09:30.120
by a rigging up electrics and signals to run a over the fences that were already

174
00:09:30.121 --> 00:09:34.290
there.
So,
uh,
Shannon didn't invent this,
but he was,
you know,
10 or 12.

175
00:09:34.291 --> 00:09:37.270
So it was pretty impressive for a kid of that age to a rig it up.
Um,

176
00:09:37.560 --> 00:09:41.410
he rigged up with his friend or Rodney,
a a barn elevator that,
uh,

177
00:09:41.470 --> 00:09:44.460
went from floor one floor two in the barn and it said that Shannon was the

178
00:09:44.461 --> 00:09:48.720
mastermind.
Rodney was the Guinea pig.
Um,
and Rodney survives.
So Rod,
he's here.

179
00:09:48.721 --> 00:09:53.420
He lived,
we talked to is,
well,
we,
we saw an interview with his sister.
So,
um,
uh,

180
00:09:53.430 --> 00:09:56.070
also he had a,
he had a pretty academically inclined family.

181
00:09:56.070 --> 00:09:58.920
His Dad was a know one of those kind of Jack of all trades that you'd see in a

182
00:09:58.921 --> 00:10:01.860
small town like this.
So he was the a furniture salesman,

183
00:10:02.010 --> 00:10:06.540
the town undertaker and the judge of probate.
Um,
he was much older than Shannon,

184
00:10:06.541 --> 00:10:08.720
so they didn't really have a very,
uh,

185
00:10:08.910 --> 00:10:11.190
strong connection because they're just the big age difference.

186
00:10:11.191 --> 00:10:14.610
His mother was a teacher and occasionally the high school principal and a sister

187
00:10:14.611 --> 00:10:17.040
Catherine clot always said was better than him at math.

188
00:10:17.041 --> 00:10:18.390
And he was part of the reason,

189
00:10:18.750 --> 00:10:20.940
she was part of the reason I think she was three or four years old and that he

190
00:10:20.941 --> 00:10:23.580
got into the field in the first place as sort of a sibling rivalry thing.

191
00:10:23.581 --> 00:10:26.920
And she would always,
uh,
give him math puzzles as a boy.
My,

192
00:10:26.980 --> 00:10:30.210
my other favorite thing about China's childhood,

193
00:10:30.240 --> 00:10:33.420
he mentioned that his favorite story growing up was a Edgar Allen Poe's,

194
00:10:33.421 --> 00:10:35.490
the Goldbug bug,
which I don't know if anyone's read it,

195
00:10:35.491 --> 00:10:36.900
but I looked into it and it's,

196
00:10:37.170 --> 00:10:40.570
it's the only at ground post story that ends with this lecture on,
uh,
uh,

197
00:10:40.670 --> 00:10:42.780
cryptanalysis,
um,
that,
uh,

198
00:10:42.781 --> 00:10:46.830
about this a giant block of text and say a he buried treasure code from pirate

199
00:10:47.250 --> 00:10:48.840
and this guy goes into a,

200
00:10:48.910 --> 00:10:52.710
the is a friend goes into this internal detail about how you decipher it using

201
00:10:52.711 --> 00:10:56.010
redundancies and the texts that Decoda what symbols mean and so on.

202
00:10:56.010 --> 00:10:59.580
It goes on for 10 pages and Shannon just hate this ups and it's pretty fitting

203
00:10:59.581 --> 00:11:03.120
that he goes on to actually become someone working in cryptography as part of

204
00:11:03.121 --> 00:11:04.790
World War Two.
Well,
we'll probably get into that,
but that,

205
00:11:04.791 --> 00:11:08.250
that's the background it comes out of.
Um,
uh,
pretty happy,

206
00:11:08.251 --> 00:11:09.540
mathematically inclined,

207
00:11:09.541 --> 00:11:13.170
a tinkering and climbs sort of kid that finds a way to put that to good use.

208
00:11:13.390 --> 00:11:16.370
<v 0>Anything special about his schooling at that,
at that time?
Did you get anything?</v>

209
00:11:16.371 --> 00:11:19.900
I'm not teachers.
Principals,
not particularly.
He actually,
you know,

210
00:11:19.901 --> 00:11:21.970
and this will be comfort for anybody who struggles with this,

211
00:11:21.971 --> 00:11:25.270
but you got some B's on his report card.
Um,
they released,

212
00:11:25.271 --> 00:11:28.540
we learned this by pouring over the Gaylord Herald Times,

213
00:11:28.541 --> 00:11:30.970
which at the time would or would publish,
uh,

214
00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:34.270
who is sort of the top of the class and that sort of thing.
Um,

215
00:11:34.271 --> 00:11:37.150
so he got some bees.
Uh,
he was,
uh,

216
00:11:37.151 --> 00:11:41.440
he remembers later on he writes a letter to a teacher who he remembers very

217
00:11:41.441 --> 00:11:45.550
fondly and talks about,
you know,
the students he remembered from his class.
Um,

218
00:11:45.580 --> 00:11:49.150
there was nothing within the records that we could find that suggested that

219
00:11:49.151 --> 00:11:51.730
there was anything that happened at school that was a particular kind of

220
00:11:51.731 --> 00:11:55.900
important.
Soon I think I were to take a step back in a way.

221
00:11:55.930 --> 00:12:00.140
The fact that he didn't have the kind of intense upbringing that like a

222
00:12:00.160 --> 00:12:02.650
Beethoven did,
right,
or,
or,
um,

223
00:12:03.010 --> 00:12:07.270
or a John Stuart mill or where their parents are like drilling them in Latin and

224
00:12:07.271 --> 00:12:10.160
Greek and trying to turn them into prodigies.
Um,

225
00:12:10.340 --> 00:12:13.300
Claude Shannon's parents seem to be,
seem to embrace what I think we call now,

226
00:12:13.301 --> 00:12:14.530
like free range parenting.

227
00:12:14.770 --> 00:12:17.320
Like Claude Shannon was playing with things he'd probably should have been

228
00:12:17.321 --> 00:12:20.790
playing with.
Um,
but he,
it gave him this,
uh,

229
00:12:20.810 --> 00:12:23.910
ability to work with his hands to be very practical.
Um,

230
00:12:24.370 --> 00:12:26.360
I'm assuming that a lot of the people in this room,
uh,

231
00:12:26.440 --> 00:12:30.620
played with early desktop computers and built and rebuild things.
And,

232
00:12:30.690 --> 00:12:34.020
and I did too.
And so I kind of identified with this part of Shannon's life,

233
00:12:34.021 --> 00:12:36.160
cause I remember staying up super late at night,

234
00:12:36.161 --> 00:12:39.610
like trying to reconstruct computers and built computers and swap out parts and

235
00:12:39.611 --> 00:12:41.500
waiting for the latest video card and all the rest.

236
00:12:41.900 --> 00:12:46.120
And I was writing all of this on a laptop that if I took it apart,

237
00:12:46.121 --> 00:12:49.060
I would've violated like the terms and conditions of the laptop.
Right.

238
00:12:49.360 --> 00:12:53.330
And I just had this moment of thinking like,
wow,
you know,
I wonder if,
uh,

239
00:12:53.350 --> 00:12:55.570
we both had kids during the time of writing this book.
Uh,

240
00:12:55.630 --> 00:12:58.990
I wonder if my daughter is going to ever have the ability to like take things

241
00:12:58.991 --> 00:13:00.370
apart the way the Claude Shannon did,

242
00:13:00.371 --> 00:13:02.350
or even in the kind of novice way that I did.

243
00:13:02.590 --> 00:13:05.890
But this was somebody who played with broken radios and we'd go around

244
00:13:05.891 --> 00:13:10.570
collecting parts and assembling things.
The education he had was,

245
00:13:10.571 --> 00:13:13.840
I think a more informal education.
He was very smart.

246
00:13:13.841 --> 00:13:18.330
People recognized it right away.
Uh,
high school only took three years for him.
Um,

247
00:13:18.370 --> 00:13:18.761
and he,

248
00:13:18.761 --> 00:13:21.730
he gets A's in the subjects that mattered to him and bees in the subjects that

249
00:13:21.731 --> 00:13:26.410
don't.
Uh,
but,
uh,
but otherwise it was a fairly ordinary childhood.

250
00:13:26.590 --> 00:13:30.310
You have to feel it for reading the bill abs book that this entire generation of

251
00:13:30.311 --> 00:13:33.720
brilliant early electrical engineers that came out of the Midwest with,

252
00:13:33.770 --> 00:13:35.600
they didn't have computers to take her with you.

253
00:13:35.630 --> 00:13:38.950
You get the feeling they could like take a tractor apart and put it together

254
00:13:38.951 --> 00:13:40.880
with their eyes closed.
And not only if they put it bed,

255
00:13:40.960 --> 00:13:43.970
he would have wanted to like get that.
That was like their first instinct when,

256
00:13:43.971 --> 00:13:48.130
when Claude Shannon is in a nursing home at the end of his life in a very sad

257
00:13:48.131 --> 00:13:50.650
period where he is fighting and struggling with Alzheimer's,

258
00:13:51.070 --> 00:13:54.520
he takes apart his walker to try to figure out if he could reconstruct it to

259
00:13:54.521 --> 00:13:55.800
make it work better.
Um,

260
00:13:55.830 --> 00:13:59.050
so this is something that has just threaded into him and who he is.

261
00:13:59.200 --> 00:14:01.150
And it's like one of the pieces of the story that,

262
00:14:01.151 --> 00:14:04.880
that is endearing and I assume is endearing to a lot of people in this room who

263
00:14:04.910 --> 00:14:08.080
probably have similar inclinations apropos of your daughter being able to take

264
00:14:08.081 --> 00:14:12.730
her computer apart in 1984 Stanford,
the Macintosh has come out and it hurts.

265
00:14:12.731 --> 00:14:15.730
Felt comes to give a talk about it and he goes,
look at this box.

266
00:14:16.060 --> 00:14:19.570
Isn't it beautiful?
You can't take it apart.
You need a special tool.

267
00:14:19.571 --> 00:14:23.380
You can't get inside.
People are going boom.
Right?
Cause it's like a toaster.

268
00:14:23.440 --> 00:14:27.690
Who'd want to take your toaster apart?
Voice from the back of the room?
Me.
Uh,

269
00:14:28.390 --> 00:14:30.940
so these are the times we live in.
So out of high school,

270
00:14:30.941 --> 00:14:32.330
he goes to University of Michigan.
Uh,

271
00:14:32.360 --> 00:14:35.320
I actually worked for someone from University of Michigan here at Google who

272
00:14:35.321 --> 00:14:39.490
says,
Yay,
let's talk about Shannon in Michigan and then on to MIT.

273
00:14:39.491 --> 00:14:41.950
So what happened in his college in it later academic year?

274
00:14:42.010 --> 00:14:45.220
So one of our favorite other pieces of information from this period as we dug up

275
00:14:45.221 --> 00:14:46.260
his college applications.

276
00:14:46.261 --> 00:14:48.750
So basically that the papers you can get on dead people,
but,
uh,

277
00:14:48.790 --> 00:14:51.620
we found his college application and in those days you could cross out your

278
00:14:51.621 --> 00:14:52.220
spelling errors

279
00:14:52.220 --> 00:14:55.520
<v 2>in pencil and still centered in,
it was like three pages and fill in the blank.</v>

280
00:14:55.820 --> 00:14:59.700
Uh,
so it was not the most,
he was a great public university.
Uh,

281
00:14:59.730 --> 00:15:01.970
and if you were in Michigan high school student and graduate and you could go to

282
00:15:01.971 --> 00:15:06.590
a Michigan,
a university.
So Shannon double majors in engineering and math,
uh,

283
00:15:06.650 --> 00:15:09.650
and again,
um,
other people did it,

284
00:15:09.651 --> 00:15:13.310
but he was sort of unique and both having those sort of a abstract background in

285
00:15:13.311 --> 00:15:17.930
mathematical logic,
uh,
and uh,
and especially a bull's theory.
And in a,

286
00:15:17.931 --> 00:15:20.690
in the more practical engineering side of electrical engineering,

287
00:15:20.691 --> 00:15:22.700
which we can get into.
But anyway,

288
00:15:22.701 --> 00:15:27.701
he sees a job application one day from a viva Bush at a MIT to apply to MIT as a

289
00:15:28.731 --> 00:15:32.780
graduate student,
a and with special emphasis on working on,
uh,
uh,
bushes,

290
00:15:32.781 --> 00:15:36.560
differential analyzer,
which is just a fascinating machine that we learned about,

291
00:15:36.590 --> 00:15:38.780
um,
in the process of working on this book,

292
00:15:38.781 --> 00:15:43.490
which is of course one of the great early on room size,
analog computers.
Um,

293
00:15:43.760 --> 00:15:46.230
and one of the things that I learned that the processes that,
you know,
when,

294
00:15:46.231 --> 00:15:49.040
when you say analog,
you know,
we don't think of the derivation of that word,

295
00:15:49.041 --> 00:15:51.680
but it's very literally at a machine that makes analogies.
Uh,

296
00:15:51.710 --> 00:15:54.180
Bush has a great quote where he says that,
um,

297
00:15:54.410 --> 00:15:58.220
if for instance we want to study the effects of the differential equations,
uh,

298
00:15:58.550 --> 00:15:58.761
uh,

299
00:15:58.761 --> 00:16:01.760
that operate on a bridge swaying in the wind to see if the bridge will stay up.

300
00:16:02.120 --> 00:16:02.810
Um,

301
00:16:02.810 --> 00:16:07.130
we design this a analog computer so that it will in a sense obey the same

302
00:16:07.131 --> 00:16:08.360
equations that are affecting the bridge.

303
00:16:08.361 --> 00:16:10.870
We set it up to make an analogy for the bridge undergoes.

304
00:16:10.880 --> 00:16:14.870
And then this applies for engineering problems and bushes using it for questions

305
00:16:14.871 --> 00:16:18.680
like,
um,
the stability of the phone network and the electrical grid,

306
00:16:18.890 --> 00:16:21.860
but also for a more advanced physics problems.
Uh,

307
00:16:22.070 --> 00:16:26.120
later on it was applied to things like I'm studying cosmic radiation or studying

308
00:16:26.121 --> 00:16:28.520
atomic structure.
Uh,
so it's,
it's the best,

309
00:16:28.760 --> 00:16:33.230
most advanced calculating devices today.
So Shannon comes to work on this.
Um,

310
00:16:33.950 --> 00:16:35.990
and uh,
Bush really has an eye for talent.

311
00:16:35.991 --> 00:16:39.960
He is a great one of these great scientific networkers and organizers.
Uh,

312
00:16:39.961 --> 00:16:42.590
and then you put Shannon to work specifically on working on the,
uh,

313
00:16:42.591 --> 00:16:46.070
the relays that are attached to a later version of the differential analyzer

314
00:16:46.071 --> 00:16:48.980
that sort of helps reconfigured the system on the fly in a sense.

315
00:16:48.981 --> 00:16:51.500
So you don't have to break it down and rebuild it for each new problem.

316
00:16:51.890 --> 00:16:55.010
And then Shannon gets to thinking about the connections in analogies between the

317
00:16:55.011 --> 00:16:59.600
relays are the kind we saw in the Theseus video.
And I'm a boolean logic.

318
00:16:59.601 --> 00:17:04.190
The idea that,
uh,
um,
the Janet comes up was essentially that,

319
00:17:04.240 --> 00:17:07.910
uh,
you can use switches as the,
the,
uh,
uh,

320
00:17:07.911 --> 00:17:12.090
units and symbols and operators in acting out a boolean logic that a ones and

321
00:17:12.100 --> 00:17:13.640
Zeros can represent yeses and nos.

322
00:17:13.640 --> 00:17:17.540
That a series and sequence can represent ands and ors,
uh,
that,
um,

323
00:17:17.870 --> 00:17:20.560
whether or not that outcome happens like a light turns on and represent a,

324
00:17:20.600 --> 00:17:25.130
the F's a of a boolean logic and the outcome.
Um,

325
00:17:25.400 --> 00:17:28.520
so Shannon writes is a great master's thesis,
um,

326
00:17:28.580 --> 00:17:33.580
that explains how to use these principles of boolean logic to change,

327
00:17:34.070 --> 00:17:36.320
uh,
circuit design.
Um,

328
00:17:36.410 --> 00:17:39.500
so that rather than being a trial and error process that you can sort of have a

329
00:17:39.501 --> 00:17:40.334
knack for,

330
00:17:40.340 --> 00:17:43.340
Shannon actually shows how you can dramatically simplify and do everything

331
00:17:43.341 --> 00:17:45.680
that's required to construct these circuits on paper.

332
00:17:45.681 --> 00:17:47.600
And he actually does a couple of examples.
He says,

333
00:17:47.601 --> 00:17:49.650
here's the circuit for a basic adding machine.

334
00:17:49.920 --> 00:17:51.540
Here's the circuit for a combination lock.

335
00:17:51.541 --> 00:17:53.190
And even he draws them in for the first time.

336
00:17:53.191 --> 00:17:57.380
Someone is a simplifying the process and designing these,
uh,

337
00:17:57.480 --> 00:18:01.170
basic computers or it gets,
uh,
with any kind of yes or no gate,
uh,

338
00:18:01.180 --> 00:18:04.410
entirely on paper.
And of course this is a sort of blockbuster for its time.

339
00:18:04.411 --> 00:18:06.870
It winds and all sorts of awards.
It winds him the Nobel prize,

340
00:18:07.200 --> 00:18:09.690
which is like the Nobel prize with the letters transposed,

341
00:18:10.030 --> 00:18:14.400
which is a award for the best young engineer,
a young engineering paper.
Um,

342
00:18:14.610 --> 00:18:15.800
but it's recognized as,

343
00:18:15.801 --> 00:18:18.540
as people would go on and say it was probably the most influential master's

344
00:18:18.541 --> 00:18:22.740
thesis maybe ever.
Um,
we both wrote master's theses.
We're not quite in that way.

345
00:18:23.190 --> 00:18:26.640
Um,
but,
uh,
Shannon's certainly wasn't in a league of its own.

346
00:18:26.641 --> 00:18:28.800
And then that's what sort of,
um,

347
00:18:29.040 --> 00:18:33.240
largest him to a degree of prominence and puts him in these upper echelons of

348
00:18:33.241 --> 00:18:34.620
the science and engineering world.

349
00:18:35.050 --> 00:18:39.240
<v 0>And the different judge in is kind of one of the first ratifications of Charles</v>

350
00:18:39.240 --> 00:18:42.670
Babbage's,
right?
The differentiators of the different engine or William Gibson's,

351
00:18:42.671 --> 00:18:45.880
if you'd like to book a novel,
uh,

352
00:18:46.030 --> 00:18:48.550
was terrain building his indignation machine at the same time.

353
00:18:48.551 --> 00:18:53.470
And it was that machine at all related.
Is that an analog machine?
So it was a,

354
00:18:53.530 --> 00:18:57.880
Turing and Shannon are working on a lot of the same concepts at the same time.

355
00:18:58.040 --> 00:18:58.540
Uh,

356
00:18:58.540 --> 00:19:02.410
and so I think the touring machine paper was published while I was in a turning

357
00:19:02.411 --> 00:19:06.040
machine paper who was a that the same year he's working on enigma until the war

358
00:19:06.050 --> 00:19:08.260
about like five or six years later on.

359
00:19:08.290 --> 00:19:11.530
But one of the more interesting elements of the story is that they,

360
00:19:11.560 --> 00:19:13.210
so they're separated by an ocean,

361
00:19:13.211 --> 00:19:15.700
but thinking and working on many of the same things and they're also very

362
00:19:15.701 --> 00:19:19.990
similar in sort of personality and temperament.
Um,
neither of them,
you know,

363
00:19:20.020 --> 00:19:23.740
they're,
they're not the life of the party.
Uh,
they are pretty quiet.

364
00:19:23.741 --> 00:19:27.250
They keep to themselves and they,
uh,

365
00:19:27.251 --> 00:19:29.620
and this is a bit of probably a leap forward in the chronology,

366
00:19:29.621 --> 00:19:30.431
but it's worth doing.

367
00:19:30.431 --> 00:19:35.431
But there's a period where the British government is suspicious about whether or

368
00:19:35.801 --> 00:19:40.390
not the Americans are going to have the technological wherewithal to send

369
00:19:40.391 --> 00:19:43.930
messages that are actually encrypted and actually protected.

370
00:19:44.440 --> 00:19:46.960
There's a lot of suspicion on both sides,
but particularly the British.

371
00:19:47.200 --> 00:19:50.920
So the Brits Send Alan Turing to the United States to do a tour of different

372
00:19:50.921 --> 00:19:53.110
facilities in New York and in Washington DC.

373
00:19:53.590 --> 00:19:58.590
And the idea is he needs to essentially stress test these devices that are used

374
00:19:59.051 --> 00:20:00.460
to for,
you know,
for example,

375
00:20:00.461 --> 00:20:02.830
for Franklin Roosevelt to communicate with Winston Churchill.

376
00:20:03.430 --> 00:20:08.120
And so touring is sent to the United States.
Um,

377
00:20:08.230 --> 00:20:08.831
funny enough,

378
00:20:08.831 --> 00:20:12.130
there's enough suspicion that his paperwork is actually not cleared and he gets

379
00:20:12.131 --> 00:20:15.670
held up and immigrations and customs for a little while.
Um,

380
00:20:15.730 --> 00:20:19.530
he ends up at bell labs where he spends a good chunk of time and in what,

381
00:20:19.570 --> 00:20:24.160
in what is one of the most incredible moments,
I think in computing history,

382
00:20:24.610 --> 00:20:29.500
Alan Turing and Claude Shannon have tea basically every day while they're at

383
00:20:29.501 --> 00:20:33.130
bell laboratories.
Uh,
and these are not guys who are going to go chat up,

384
00:20:33.190 --> 00:20:35.620
you know,
the sort of,
they're,
they're not,
they're not,
you know,

385
00:20:36.220 --> 00:20:37.300
they're not unfriendly people,

386
00:20:37.301 --> 00:20:40.870
but they're certainly not going to go make new friends very easily.
Um,

387
00:20:41.200 --> 00:20:43.690
so they empty every day.
And interestingly enough,

388
00:20:43.900 --> 00:20:46.290
the secrecy of the work that they're,

389
00:20:46.300 --> 00:20:50.770
that they're doing prevents either of them from talking about code breaking or

390
00:20:50.771 --> 00:20:55.690
cryptography.
And so it frees them up to talk about artificial intelligence.

391
00:20:55.720 --> 00:20:57.940
They are,
they are sitting around asking questions like,

392
00:20:58.120 --> 00:21:02.070
could you build a computer that could work as well as a brain.
Uh,

393
00:21:02.150 --> 00:21:04.030
and this is in the 1940s.
Um,

394
00:21:04.090 --> 00:21:08.710
and so you have these two giants sitting together at t and like,
we always like,

395
00:21:08.740 --> 00:21:12.040
like to wonder like what it must have been like,
uh,
in that particular moment.

396
00:21:12.850 --> 00:21:17.470
And so the,
uh,
the,
the sort of,
there's a couple of other pieces of story.

397
00:21:17.471 --> 00:21:21.670
One is that touring actually visits Shannon at his home in New York's West

398
00:21:21.670 --> 00:21:26.670
village and we think maybe a half dozen if that people visited his home.

399
00:21:26.970 --> 00:21:29.450
Uh,
and so it says something that Turing was there.
Um,

400
00:21:29.650 --> 00:21:33.080
but they ended up striking up a friendship and,
uh,
so that,
that center,

401
00:21:33.120 --> 00:21:36.960
the one connection between them intellectually,
they do stay in touch.
Uh,

402
00:21:36.970 --> 00:21:39.190
and later on after the war is over,

403
00:21:39.340 --> 00:21:43.000
Shannon and his wife go and visit touring and like,

404
00:21:43.030 --> 00:21:47.710
like kind of a old ballplayer as I guess they go down to Turing's basement and

405
00:21:47.711 --> 00:21:50.880
start playing with the computer that he's built and they start keep,

406
00:21:50.881 --> 00:21:53.830
they just keep up with is to pick up exactly where they left off.
Um,

407
00:21:53.840 --> 00:21:57.670
and the story obviously has a tragic ending,
uh,
turning,
you know,

408
00:21:57.671 --> 00:21:58.450
by by someone guns,

409
00:21:58.450 --> 00:22:01.750
it's suicide and by all accounts it seems to be suicide that there are still

410
00:22:01.751 --> 00:22:05.860
some discrepancies about that.
Um,
that happened shortly after Shannon's visit,

411
00:22:05.861 --> 00:22:08.400
but we always sort of think that there's something,
um,

412
00:22:08.530 --> 00:22:10.390
appropriate in the fact that they were a,

413
00:22:10.430 --> 00:22:14.410
that these two war time code breakers and code makers were able to reunite after

414
00:22:14.411 --> 00:22:18.280
the war.
And you know,
without missing a beat,
they go and play with this,
uh,

415
00:22:18.281 --> 00:22:20.530
this device and Turing's basement that actually is trying,

416
00:22:20.531 --> 00:22:23.560
he's trying to make a computer that'll talk.
Uh,
and that's what,
that's what he's,

417
00:22:23.600 --> 00:22:27.400
he's working on.
Interesting because Shannon goes onto a bell labs,

418
00:22:27.401 --> 00:22:29.920
which is the pinnacle of research and making people talk.

419
00:22:31.210 --> 00:22:35.900
We have ways to make the talk.
Anyways.
So let's talk about bell labs.
Uh,

420
00:22:35.980 --> 00:22:38.830
not just in the context of Shannon and tournament,
but bill labs in general.

421
00:22:38.840 --> 00:22:41.000
And when we talk about bell labs is,
you know,

422
00:22:41.090 --> 00:22:45.370
the idea factory traces its hundred year history,
more or less.
Um,

423
00:22:45.550 --> 00:22:48.940
it started in New York downtown and then by the time the war came and they'd,

424
00:22:49.030 --> 00:22:52.480
they'd moved to New Jersey and Shannon was there through that entire transition.

425
00:22:52.481 --> 00:22:54.910
So there's a lot to say about right then you would bill,

426
00:22:55.170 --> 00:22:56.170
right for those of you that,

427
00:22:56.340 --> 00:22:59.110
<v 2>or the Google New York offices,
Bell Labs,
you can still see the building,
uh,</v>

428
00:22:59.170 --> 00:23:02.670
near the,
uh,
near the highlight now.
And you can walk across the high line,

429
00:23:02.690 --> 00:23:03.400
look to,
uh,

430
00:23:03.400 --> 00:23:07.140
what was the original bell labs building and even had to one of the ports for a

431
00:23:07.141 --> 00:23:11.670
train to come in and out before when there's an industrial area.
But,
uh,
anyway,

432
00:23:11.700 --> 00:23:15.090
um,
and we've written a little bit about bell labs and separate pieces about the

433
00:23:15.091 --> 00:23:17.730
book.
And we've said the bill adds probably isn't a good example of how to make a

434
00:23:17.731 --> 00:23:19.730
successful company because,
well,
the answer,

435
00:23:19.731 --> 00:23:21.700
how many external advantages they had.
A,
they,
they had,

436
00:23:21.701 --> 00:23:24.830
they had the patents going back to bill,
they had the government monopolies.

437
00:23:24.831 --> 00:23:27.880
So they never really had to worry about money.
But at the same time,
um,

438
00:23:28.860 --> 00:23:30.510
we also say that a,
he,

439
00:23:30.530 --> 00:23:33.390
if successful companies in the economy can behave like bell labs,

440
00:23:33.391 --> 00:23:36.880
we're all better off the build labs,
took that money and put it towards the Edge,

441
00:23:37.520 --> 00:23:41.280
port it into basic research and poured it into the work of people like a Shannon

442
00:23:41.281 --> 00:23:42.480
a little bit earlier before him,

443
00:23:42.481 --> 00:23:46.820
a Clinton Davison who got a Nobel prize for working on the atomic structure.
Um,

444
00:23:46.850 --> 00:23:47.001
but,

445
00:23:47.001 --> 00:23:52.001
but poured into people who didn't do work that immediately paid off in a small

446
00:23:52.041 --> 00:23:52.760
window,

447
00:23:52.760 --> 00:23:56.120
but was enormously important for the development of technology more broadly.

448
00:23:56.121 --> 00:23:59.020
And there's a great quote,
I think it was from the Henry Pollock,
um,

449
00:23:59.390 --> 00:24:01.490
who overlap with Shannon at bell labs who said,
you know,

450
00:24:01.491 --> 00:24:05.360
there's this attitude there that,
um,
we,
uh,

451
00:24:05.750 --> 00:24:08.780
we may not be doing work that's gonna pay off in 10 or 20 years,
but you know,

452
00:24:08.781 --> 00:24:11.790
hey,
we're the phone company,
we're going to be there anyway.
So,
uh,

453
00:24:11.870 --> 00:24:15.440
there's this confidence of,
of being able to have people like Shannon who could,

454
00:24:15.441 --> 00:24:18.380
uh,
you know,
noodle around on whatever.
So that,

455
00:24:18.381 --> 00:24:20.130
that's not Shannon's entire career there.
You know,
when,

456
00:24:20.131 --> 00:24:21.410
when it comes on board at bell labs,

457
00:24:21.411 --> 00:24:24.470
it's wartime and he'd has a lot of assignments so he's not especially happy

458
00:24:24.471 --> 00:24:26.330
about.
And those include a fire control,

459
00:24:26.570 --> 00:24:29.370
which is sort of using statistical modeling to control,
um,

460
00:24:29.440 --> 00:24:32.510
anti aircraft guns of the kind.
We also saw in the video,
um,

461
00:24:32.810 --> 00:24:33.710
take some of those insights,

462
00:24:33.711 --> 00:24:36.830
especially working with the Norbert Wiener who had written a kind of famously

463
00:24:36.831 --> 00:24:40.970
intimidating text on a statistical modeling,
um,
uh,

464
00:24:41.000 --> 00:24:43.110
and some of those insights going to information theory.
And,

465
00:24:43.111 --> 00:24:46.110
and also as Jenny mentioned,
Shannon's working on a,
um,

466
00:24:46.160 --> 00:24:48.080
cryptography on scrambled speech systems.

467
00:24:48.081 --> 00:24:50.780
And then writes a paper that doesn't come out until after the war's over.

468
00:24:51.020 --> 00:24:54.820
But it's about the theoretical conditions for unbreakable code about,
uh,

469
00:24:55.010 --> 00:24:59.060
proving the and breakability of a one time pad code.
Um,
even though,
uh,

470
00:24:59.150 --> 00:25:02.150
it practically it's the kind of code wouldn't be able to implement in actual

471
00:25:02.151 --> 00:25:04.580
wartime conditions.
But,
um,

472
00:25:05.180 --> 00:25:09.320
Shannon takes these insights from fire control from cryptography and from his

473
00:25:09.321 --> 00:25:13.100
other interests.
Andy sort of pours them into this project on information theory.

474
00:25:13.101 --> 00:25:15.740
There's working on a lot of them in his spare time,
um,

475
00:25:15.980 --> 00:25:18.950
and later on during his day job at bell labs and it gets a little more freedom

476
00:25:18.951 --> 00:25:21.440
after the war winds down.
And we have these,
uh,

477
00:25:21.500 --> 00:25:25.550
quotes from his girlfriend at the time who lived in Shannon's building,
um,

478
00:25:26.210 --> 00:25:28.940
said that,
uh,
you know,
some days just didn't want to go to work because it was,

479
00:25:28.941 --> 00:25:29.990
he was stressed out by the,

480
00:25:30.040 --> 00:25:32.740
the crowding in the office by the wartime conditions by the,

481
00:25:32.741 --> 00:25:35.430
the amount of time he had to be in the office.
Uh,

482
00:25:35.630 --> 00:25:40.250
but he was always at home wherever he was.
He was scribbling on Napkins.
He was,

483
00:25:40.251 --> 00:25:42.500
uh,
talking over ideas to himself.
Uh,

484
00:25:42.501 --> 00:25:45.350
he would stare off into space and as you're working on something that was big,

485
00:25:45.740 --> 00:25:49.010
uh,
and after he had a little more freedom to do this,
a full time at bell labs,

486
00:25:49.011 --> 00:25:52.490
this is when he develops his great work and information theory.

487
00:25:52.491 --> 00:25:55.460
And the neat thing is that Shannon is of course not the only one,

488
00:25:55.670 --> 00:25:59.030
especially in the math group of more broadly at bell labs who's doing the sort

489
00:25:59.031 --> 00:26:03.650
of a long term,
uh,
very long horizon sort of basic research.

490
00:26:03.650 --> 00:26:04.680
And of course,
um,

491
00:26:05.420 --> 00:26:10.420
information theory is Shannon's paper is immediately have a theoretical interest

492
00:26:10.641 --> 00:26:13.990
and immediately provokes a so much interest in scientific literature,

493
00:26:14.010 --> 00:26:17.390
doesn't really start to have practical payoffs for many,

494
00:26:17.391 --> 00:26:19.540
many decades down the road.
Um,

495
00:26:19.790 --> 00:26:22.100
but that's the neat thing about what bell labs enable Shannon to do.

496
00:26:22.101 --> 00:26:25.610
They're willing to keep him on a and pay a salary as he worked on this thing

497
00:26:25.611 --> 00:26:27.680
that had enormous payoff,
uh,
you know,

498
00:26:27.710 --> 00:26:31.570
decades down the line and kind of as a final nice gesture when Shannon decides

499
00:26:31.580 --> 00:26:33.350
to take a job at MIT and leave bell labs,

500
00:26:33.560 --> 00:26:36.770
Bell labs decides to keep them on the payroll and they keep an office for him.

501
00:26:36.980 --> 00:26:41.000
Just sort of as a gesture of respect that he was one of the giants.
Um,
we,

502
00:26:41.020 --> 00:26:43.500
we went there to,
into their new building at Murray Hill,
New Jersey.

503
00:26:44.010 --> 00:26:44.843
<v 0>Um,</v>

504
00:26:45.120 --> 00:26:47.520
they have a bust of Claude Shannon and one of the buildings has been named after

505
00:26:47.521 --> 00:26:48.280
him.
Uh,
but,

506
00:26:48.280 --> 00:26:51.540
but he's still one of the people that is one of the few people along with the

507
00:26:51.541 --> 00:26:54.960
emitters and the transistor that is just a still revered in that place.

508
00:26:55.160 --> 00:26:58.000
It just to,
as a,
to add to that a bit,

509
00:26:58.350 --> 00:27:02.460
I noticed that there were some chess chess boards outside and it called to mind

510
00:27:02.461 --> 00:27:04.680
for me just cause we've been steeped in this,
uh,

511
00:27:04.800 --> 00:27:07.710
bell labs was a vibrant place in that way too.

512
00:27:07.711 --> 00:27:11.530
That there were chess games that there were competitions,
um,

513
00:27:11.640 --> 00:27:14.730
Channon builds at one point,
uh,
I think it's a rock,
paper,

514
00:27:14.731 --> 00:27:17.580
scissors robot and they have a contest against some other guy who built the
rock,

515
00:27:17.581 --> 00:27:20.460
paper,
scissors,
robot.
That might not be the exact story,

516
00:27:20.461 --> 00:27:21.420
but it's something like that.

517
00:27:22.290 --> 00:27:25.110
It was a company that gave people remarkable flexibility.

518
00:27:25.110 --> 00:27:29.220
And I'm not sure that there is,
this is,
this is a hazard of guests.

519
00:27:29.250 --> 00:27:32.850
I'm not sure there is a mathematical theory of communication without bell

520
00:27:32.851 --> 00:27:34.090
laboratories.
Um,

521
00:27:34.140 --> 00:27:37.710
both because of the content of what Claude Shannon was working on.
You know,

522
00:27:37.711 --> 00:27:40.350
there were some times sometimes when he was working on very practical things,

523
00:27:40.351 --> 00:27:43.950
one of his first pieces of work at bell labs is actually looking at,
uh,

524
00:27:44.010 --> 00:27:45.620
the coloration of wires,
uh,

525
00:27:45.690 --> 00:27:48.810
within the phone system and whether the coloration of wires of could,

526
00:27:48.811 --> 00:27:50.490
could be improved upon.
And he actually does,

527
00:27:50.520 --> 00:27:53.270
he writes a paper that improves upon the coloration wire.

528
00:27:53.280 --> 00:27:56.450
So some of it got to that.
It's a very practical level.
Um,

529
00:27:56.520 --> 00:28:01.520
but remember he publishes his mathematical theory of communication in the Bell

530
00:28:02.460 --> 00:28:02.700
Systems Technical Journal,

531
00:28:02.700 --> 00:28:07.110
which is an academic journal run by bell labs for the better part of the 20th

532
00:28:07.111 --> 00:28:09.870
century.
It's like corporate blog,
eat your heart out,
right?

533
00:28:09.870 --> 00:28:11.880
I mean this is like not,
this is serious stuff.

534
00:28:11.881 --> 00:28:16.050
This is a lengthy 77 page paper and bell kept this publication going for most of

535
00:28:16.051 --> 00:28:19.170
the 20th century.
And you can read the archives online.
Um,

536
00:28:19.380 --> 00:28:21.270
there is something about a company,
again,

537
00:28:21.271 --> 00:28:24.180
they had a certain blessing in the resources that they had,

538
00:28:24.360 --> 00:28:27.300
but the ways that they chose to use those resources,

539
00:28:27.301 --> 00:28:30.420
we think there's still a lot left to learn from them.
Um,
and again,

540
00:28:30.421 --> 00:28:33.520
the idea factory is a,
is a wonderful way to start.
Um,
but uh,

541
00:28:33.620 --> 00:28:37.860
there are obvious echoes of,
of Bell Labs around here.
Uh,
and,

542
00:28:37.861 --> 00:28:41.490
and I do think that there's something about the kind of freedom they gave people

543
00:28:41.491 --> 00:28:42.990
that led to some remarkable things.

544
00:28:43.090 --> 00:28:47.340
This is a private sector company that won six Nobel Prizes,
uh,

545
00:28:47.341 --> 00:28:49.980
over the course of the 20th.
Not even Shannon.
Yeah,
not even sure.
The one,
one,

546
00:28:49.981 --> 00:28:53.710
two and Shannon and information theory.
Um,
and so you,

547
00:28:53.711 --> 00:28:56.870
you really have to sort of step back and say to yourself,
uh,
you know,
what,

548
00:28:56.871 --> 00:28:58.160
what was in the water.
Uh,

549
00:28:58.161 --> 00:29:01.170
and we do get into some of some of that in the book and they built telephone

550
00:29:01.171 --> 00:29:04.770
poles.
It's still last for 50 years.
Exactly what the design aesthetic,

551
00:29:04.830 --> 00:29:08.490
even better,
the math group that,
um,
that Shannon joins,

552
00:29:08.491 --> 00:29:12.540
one of the rites of passage is they climb like telephone poles and you have to

553
00:29:12.541 --> 00:29:16.110
actually go and be a telephone engineer,
uh,
on the ground for a little while.

554
00:29:16.111 --> 00:29:17.010
And it sort of,
this,

555
00:29:17.580 --> 00:29:20.130
I wouldn't quite call it a ritual because I'm not sure that everybody was

556
00:29:20.131 --> 00:29:20.964
required to do it,

557
00:29:21.000 --> 00:29:23.910
but it was a sort of thing that the math group would just dive in and do that in

558
00:29:23.911 --> 00:29:25.170
order to understand problems.

559
00:29:25.380 --> 00:29:29.190
And they would attach these mathematicians to physicists into engineers and to

560
00:29:29.191 --> 00:29:32.250
others and say,
just go,
go help them for a little while to figure something out.

561
00:29:32.460 --> 00:29:34.350
Uh,
and it was,
it was a pretty amazing thing.

562
00:29:34.710 --> 00:29:36.600
And we should mention that the pull quote,

563
00:29:36.610 --> 00:29:39.760
there's the paper and the Bill Technical Journal and a couple of years later it

564
00:29:39.770 --> 00:29:42.700
was dubbed in scientific American,
the Magna Carta

565
00:29:42.780 --> 00:29:44.880
<v 2>of information theory.
I mean,
yeah,
when,</v>

566
00:29:44.910 --> 00:29:47.830
when people ask us to explain why this paper matters,
that that's the pull quote.

567
00:29:47.831 --> 00:29:50.920
We use that because it's just the founding document.
This is the thing.

568
00:29:50.970 --> 00:29:53.980
And not only was it the founding document,
but he first,

569
00:29:53.981 --> 00:29:57.310
he basically produced all of the follow on fear hymns improves as well.

570
00:29:57.311 --> 00:30:01.690
He left almost nothing to be done.
It's really obnoxious.
I mean the uh,

571
00:30:01.750 --> 00:30:04.600
the engine,
the other you think about that is when he first publishes it,

572
00:30:04.750 --> 00:30:07.060
and this sort of speaks to the other nice quality of Shannon,

573
00:30:07.061 --> 00:30:11.350
is that he's very modest guy.
He calls it a mathematical theory of communication,

574
00:30:11.530 --> 00:30:16.270
a math and have when it's republished a year later as a book by people who take

575
00:30:16.271 --> 00:30:19.000
it in.
And some of that book is him,
but a lot of it is not,

576
00:30:19.001 --> 00:30:21.480
it's the work of other people.
They put the title,

577
00:30:21.500 --> 00:30:23.590
the mathematical theory of communication,

578
00:30:23.620 --> 00:30:28.300
which just goes to show how highly it was regarded by people in the field within

579
00:30:28.301 --> 00:30:29.290
no time at all.

580
00:30:29.920 --> 00:30:32.590
While we're on the theory it was going to get to it a little later.
Perfect.

581
00:30:32.591 --> 00:30:36.520
But it's so important.
Is there an elegant statement of it?

582
00:30:36.550 --> 00:30:41.500
It's as concise as equals MC squared or Newtons,
Newton's posture,

583
00:30:41.510 --> 00:30:43.810
let's,
or is it really,
really hard to understand?

584
00:30:43.990 --> 00:30:46.510
I think if there's one thing to pull out,
and this is actually,

585
00:30:46.600 --> 00:30:50.580
this is not our choice to pull it out,
but it's Shannon's a formula for a,
um,

586
00:30:50.680 --> 00:30:55.440
bits in terms of h a v a as a measure of probabilities.

587
00:30:55.500 --> 00:31:00.470
Um,
and uh,
the interesting thing,
Shannon's a formula for a bit content is,
um,

588
00:31:00.850 --> 00:31:01.481
on his,

589
00:31:01.481 --> 00:31:05.350
a bust at bell labs and in several other places would have his bust as also on

590
00:31:05.351 --> 00:31:07.670
the back of the tombstone.
And,
uh,
Jimmy went there.

591
00:31:07.740 --> 00:31:10.130
I wasn't able to make that trip where we visited Shannon scourge him.

592
00:31:10.131 --> 00:31:12.190
He visited chance grave in the Mount Auburn Cemetery.

593
00:31:12.191 --> 00:31:14.820
And if you walk around to the back and push aside a couple of bushes,

594
00:31:14.840 --> 00:31:17.380
you can see in grade from the back.
And we spoke to his family.

595
00:31:18.100 --> 00:31:20.890
I think there was some talk of a putting it on the front,

596
00:31:20.891 --> 00:31:22.900
but I think I was his wife.
I think his wife,

597
00:31:22.901 --> 00:31:26.440
so his kids wanted the equation on the front.
Um,

598
00:31:26.530 --> 00:31:29.770
and his wife thought it more appropriate to have it on the back and now it's

599
00:31:29.771 --> 00:31:33.910
covered by a bush.
And so if you go there,
it's a famous cemetery,

600
00:31:34.000 --> 00:31:37.800
Supreme Court justices,
uh,
the presidents of Harvard,
et Cetera,

601
00:31:37.801 --> 00:31:40.090
or they're all buried there.
And um,
if you,

602
00:31:40.150 --> 00:31:43.120
if you have to sort of push the Bush side to see the,
the uh,

603
00:31:43.300 --> 00:31:46.090
the equation and engraved on the back.
And,
and I wouldn't say that,

604
00:31:46.091 --> 00:31:50.380
I think one of the reasons it does kind of sum up the why it's maybe EMC equals

605
00:31:50.381 --> 00:31:51.640
mc squared level maybe,

606
00:31:51.970 --> 00:31:55.270
is that it does sort of encode a lot of information you can unpack.

607
00:31:55.271 --> 00:31:57.760
And one of the things that we like doing in the book as sort of training and

608
00:31:57.770 --> 00:32:00.610
intellectual history of information,

609
00:32:00.611 --> 00:32:03.580
of trying to pin it down and say a physical objective quantity.

610
00:32:03.880 --> 00:32:07.190
And we sort of Christ the different,
uh,
you know,
fumbling attempts to get to it.

611
00:32:07.230 --> 00:32:11.410
Uh,
especially,
uh,
beginning with a,
you know,
Lord Kelvin back in the 19th century,

612
00:32:11.411 --> 00:32:14.170
working on a transatlantic calligraphy,

613
00:32:14.290 --> 00:32:18.100
but also getting into the predecessors that Shannon himself sites,
uh,
uh,

614
00:32:18.101 --> 00:32:19.750
Harry Nyquist and Ralph,

615
00:32:19.751 --> 00:32:22.630
hardly both his predecessors at bell labs who also have their own sort of

616
00:32:22.631 --> 00:32:25.810
formulations of a information content.
Um,

617
00:32:26.230 --> 00:32:30.580
and Shannon's addition to this is Ada.
Well the idea that,
um,

618
00:32:31.180 --> 00:32:31.361
uh,

619
00:32:31.361 --> 00:32:34.330
information contest with the size of the symbol vocabulary and sort of already

620
00:32:34.331 --> 00:32:36.070
been there in Nyquist work,
uh,
on,

621
00:32:36.100 --> 00:32:39.590
on telegraphs and then Hartley's work more generally.
But what Shannon comes in,

622
00:32:39.591 --> 00:32:42.560
ebbs and your Norbert Wiener was also working on a similar direction when it

623
00:32:42.561 --> 00:32:46.840
comes in,
adds as a sort of probabilistic element that it's not just a,

624
00:32:47.200 --> 00:32:50.420
um,
the,
the size of the simple vocabulary you're choosing from.

625
00:32:50.630 --> 00:32:53.510
It's the fact that you have to measure in the probability of getting a certain

626
00:32:53.511 --> 00:32:56.360
choice.
And the way the analogy he uses,
um,

627
00:32:56.570 --> 00:33:00.350
for a basic understanding of what a bid is,
is think of a,
a coin,

628
00:33:00.351 --> 00:33:02.900
a fair coin is stored in one bit because there's a 50,

629
00:33:02.901 --> 00:33:05.060
50 chance that can land on heads or tails.

630
00:33:05.061 --> 00:33:08.840
And as you wait the coin more and more in one direction or the other,
uh,

631
00:33:08.900 --> 00:33:12.290
the information content that stores could be said to decrease because the choice

632
00:33:12.291 --> 00:33:15.140
becomes a little more predictable.
But it was Shannon who had it,

633
00:33:15.141 --> 00:33:18.620
that sort of probabilistic twist.
And of course in his modest as he was,
he said,

634
00:33:18.621 --> 00:33:21.650
I didn't think that was a big deal.
I guess we think it's a big deal.

635
00:33:22.070 --> 00:33:23.030
It is a very big deal.

636
00:33:24.170 --> 00:33:27.080
Searching around on the web for some pithy Shannon quotes.

637
00:33:27.081 --> 00:33:30.980
I came up with a couple,
not quit,
maybe not quite as elegant as a,

638
00:33:31.450 --> 00:33:35.540
this is tombstone,
but maybe more,
uh,
more understandable to a lay audience.

639
00:33:35.541 --> 00:33:37.190
And I came up with these,
or Shannon quotes,

640
00:33:37.460 --> 00:33:42.460
information is the negative reciprocal value of probability or information is

641
00:33:43.011 --> 00:33:47.910
the resolution of uncertainty.
And thinking about that,
it struck me.
Um,

642
00:33:48.110 --> 00:33:50.750
if you look at the two poles of his who his most famous work,

643
00:33:50.751 --> 00:33:53.510
you've got Boolean Algebra,
you've got basically,

644
00:33:53.570 --> 00:33:55.640
forgive me Bayesians statistics on the other side,

645
00:33:55.880 --> 00:34:00.880
you've got the certainty and the structure of a binary number system contrasted

646
00:34:01.701 --> 00:34:04.760
with uncertainty,
probability.
Uh,
it's,

647
00:34:04.820 --> 00:34:09.740
it's kind of a nice dipole I think to reflect is his work.
Yeah,

648
00:34:09.741 --> 00:34:11.570
that's a great way of putting it.
We didn't think about anything about that,

649
00:34:11.630 --> 00:34:12.590
that's known for that.
That's really,

650
00:34:12.591 --> 00:34:14.670
I'm going to use that as a poet for the paperback.

651
00:34:14.910 --> 00:34:18.040
That's a really good way forward on that particular audience.
It's uh,
yeah.

652
00:34:18.160 --> 00:34:18.993
I do want to get,

653
00:34:19.070 --> 00:34:22.160
we will get probably deeper into the philosophy and information versus
knowledge.

654
00:34:22.170 --> 00:34:23.340
Actually have a great Frank Zappa.

655
00:34:23.850 --> 00:34:25.920
<v 0>Can I just say one of the things that we didn't really get into,</v>

656
00:34:25.921 --> 00:34:28.680
because this is something that speaks to people more generally,

657
00:34:28.681 --> 00:34:31.230
who maybe aren't deep into theory,

658
00:34:31.260 --> 00:34:34.560
but want to think about how a theory like that or how something that

659
00:34:34.561 --> 00:34:35.790
consequential it can be developed.

660
00:34:36.060 --> 00:34:38.640
It's incredibly important to remember two things.

661
00:34:38.641 --> 00:34:43.641
One that he started thinking about this in 1938 roughly right in 1937,

662
00:34:44.401 --> 00:34:49.380
1938.
It takes 10 years for this to crystallize into this paper.

663
00:34:50.040 --> 00:34:50.340
You know,

664
00:34:50.340 --> 00:34:53.640
that now has an entire field devoted to a field of study and people read it

665
00:34:53.641 --> 00:34:57.510
every year.
Um,
it takes 10 years.
It takes a long time for this to crystallize.

666
00:34:57.530 --> 00:35:01.740
During that time he's working on cryptography is working on how to shoot things

667
00:35:01.741 --> 00:35:06.100
down from the sky.
Uh,
he's playing with tub,
the telephone system at,
at the,

668
00:35:06.120 --> 00:35:07.350
at enormous scale.

669
00:35:07.730 --> 00:35:10.630
The other thing to remember is he's not working on it full time.
It's,

670
00:35:10.640 --> 00:35:14.230
it's what we affectionately in a recent piece called the side hustle.
Uh,
like,

671
00:35:14.990 --> 00:35:17.970
like I hope I have a side hustle as good as,

672
00:35:17.980 --> 00:35:19.800
as a mathematical theory of communication.

673
00:35:19.801 --> 00:35:23.610
But I think those two things are important because it's really easy to look at

674
00:35:23.611 --> 00:35:27.100
somebody like Shannon and say,
well that's just,
you know,

675
00:35:27.180 --> 00:35:30.540
just full time working on this 10 years.
And it's a,
it's a given.

676
00:35:30.690 --> 00:35:35.400
It really wasn't.
He was,
um,
he was not,
I wouldn't say distracted,

677
00:35:35.401 --> 00:35:38.130
but he was occupied with many other during the time.

678
00:35:38.400 --> 00:35:42.540
And in a way I think that actually makes what he did all the more impressive.
Uh,

679
00:35:42.570 --> 00:35:46.020
but those two facts,
I think people forget it.
And,
and you,
you can read it,

680
00:35:46.050 --> 00:35:49.710
you can see his name next to this paper and in sort of gloss over the fact that

681
00:35:49.830 --> 00:35:54.830
this is a tea is a decade long journey to get to some of the defining principles

682
00:35:54.841 --> 00:35:58.200
in this field from the sublime to the ridiculous.

683
00:35:58.770 --> 00:36:02.530
Let's talk a little bit about Shannon,
the trickster and the,
the,

684
00:36:02.531 --> 00:36:05.880
the tinkerer in the,
maybe even the bone Vivanta all that you say.

685
00:36:05.881 --> 00:36:09.150
He wasn't that much of a social guy,
but,
uh,
I read some stories.

686
00:36:09.151 --> 00:36:09.984
Tell us about them.

687
00:36:10.230 --> 00:36:15.200
<v 2>And so,
uh,
this is the great thing is that Shannon was born tanker from the,</v>

688
00:36:15.210 --> 00:36:17.610
from the very earliest records will happen.
This is what he did.

689
00:36:17.611 --> 00:36:20.730
But at the same time,
once he sort of becomes the information theory guy,

690
00:36:20.731 --> 00:36:23.320
he has a little more freedom to,
to short of show this off.
And,

691
00:36:23.650 --> 00:36:26.310
and we do think it's nice that Shannon could have kind of made a play towards

692
00:36:26.311 --> 00:36:29.220
becoming a much more public figure,
sort of public intellectual,

693
00:36:29.221 --> 00:36:32.400
a sort of a pontificator on science.
He just,
he's not interested in that.

694
00:36:32.401 --> 00:36:35.160
He's interested in just sort of playing and making things with his hands.

695
00:36:35.161 --> 00:36:38.460
So he has this,
uh,
when he moves into his a house in Massachusetts,

696
00:36:38.461 --> 00:36:42.210
he has a two story workshop addition added to the House that some people call it

697
00:36:42.211 --> 00:36:42.691
the toy room.

698
00:36:42.691 --> 00:36:46.350
I don't think Shannon called softcon today is currently the dad's workshop.
Um,

699
00:36:46.740 --> 00:36:48.190
but he built things in there like the,

700
00:36:48.191 --> 00:36:50.010
the flame throwing trumpet that we mentioned.
Uh,

701
00:36:50.011 --> 00:36:51.370
he had a fleet of customers you're going to say.

702
00:36:51.420 --> 00:36:54.240
So you had off balance going to cycles and made you in a cycling and juggling

703
00:36:54.241 --> 00:36:57.480
simultaneous leave.
And harder,
because apparently juggling and Unicycle,

704
00:36:57.481 --> 00:37:01.740
it was too easy for him.
So he gets really into the scientific study of juggling.

705
00:37:01.741 --> 00:37:04.890
He writes one of the first papers that we know on a jumping physics where he

706
00:37:04.891 --> 00:37:08.840
comes up with an equation,
uh,
uh,
you know,
correlating a number of balls,
um,

707
00:37:09.050 --> 00:37:12.540
timing air,
uh,
so on,
um,
he uh,

708
00:37:13.140 --> 00:37:16.740
asks one of his colleagues if he can measure his juggling as you hold some

709
00:37:16.741 --> 00:37:19.060
upside down on the theory that um,

710
00:37:19.470 --> 00:37:23.120
one would be able to kind of combine the elegance of toss juggling with the,
uh,

711
00:37:23.160 --> 00:37:25.410
physical efficiency of bounced juggling where he bounced the ball is off the

712
00:37:25.411 --> 00:37:28.880
ground.
So if gravity is helping you juggle upside down and you're theoretically,

713
00:37:28.890 --> 00:37:31.590
it'd be much more it didn't work out because if you can say in the book,
Yeah.

714
00:37:31.591 --> 00:37:35.310
How else?
Anything,
anyone do anything upside down?
See does that,

715
00:37:35.311 --> 00:37:37.770
he makes the ultimate machine,
which is one of our favorites,

716
00:37:37.771 --> 00:37:41.520
which is a box and we've seen a copy of it.
A lot of people know this.

717
00:37:41.521 --> 00:37:45.390
It's the box.
You press a button on the box,
a hand comes out of the box,

718
00:37:45.450 --> 00:37:48.330
press the button,
turns itself off,
and then tracked back into the box.

719
00:37:48.420 --> 00:37:51.800
<v 0>You can see youtube videos of this,
by the way,
it's a physicists or a famous,
uh,</v>

720
00:37:51.870 --> 00:37:54.720
device and the ultimate machine.
Yeah.
The ultimate machine.

721
00:37:54.880 --> 00:37:56.460
Its only purpose is to turn itself off.

722
00:37:56.660 --> 00:38:01.430
<v 2>So it's a,
so this is what Shannon does,
um,
for fun.
Oh,
there's the,</v>

723
00:38:01.431 --> 00:38:04.450
uh,
the uh,
Roman numeral calculator,
which is called throwback,

724
00:38:04.460 --> 00:38:06.140
which is an acronym for I think thrifty,

725
00:38:06.470 --> 00:38:10.490
a backwards looking Roman numeral calc or something like that.
But it's,

726
00:38:10.500 --> 00:38:14.630
it's an all caps throwback is his name.
And,
um,
one of the first wearables,

727
00:38:14.631 --> 00:38:19.000
which is,
uh,
a project you worked on with Ed Thorp to,
um,

728
00:38:19.190 --> 00:38:22.630
beat the house at Roulette.
So the idea is that,
uh,
it,
um,

729
00:38:23.180 --> 00:38:25.940
divides the roulette table up into eighths.
They got it into,

730
00:38:25.941 --> 00:38:28.580
and if you can calculate a,
with some knowledge,
we,
if,
you know,

731
00:38:28.581 --> 00:38:30.640
when the ball goes down and you start the computer,
uh,

732
00:38:30.650 --> 00:38:33.920
it can signal which eighth of the roulette wheel,
the balls likely land in.

733
00:38:33.921 --> 00:38:37.390
So Thorpe and him Wynn's money from the casinos in Vegas using this.
I'll,

734
00:38:37.391 --> 00:38:40.390
the other cool thing is that its output is via kind of primitive ear bud.

735
00:38:40.660 --> 00:38:43.960
So based on the frequency,
I think they had to memorize these frequencies.

736
00:38:43.961 --> 00:38:47.770
You can tell based on frequency where the ball's going to land a onetime Thorpe,

737
00:38:47.800 --> 00:38:50.260
the earbud falls out in someone screams because they think it's an insect

738
00:38:50.261 --> 00:38:53.940
because no one really had seen ear buds.
I'm so authority gets in trouble a lot.

739
00:38:53.941 --> 00:38:56.440
He had to run to the bathroom and put it back in.
So they,
uh,

740
00:38:56.441 --> 00:38:59.200
they call this off because they were afraid of getting roughed up by the mafia,

741
00:38:59.500 --> 00:39:02.890
which was,
uh,
which,
you know,
control because he doesn't Vegas at the time.

742
00:39:02.891 --> 00:39:06.520
So they don't really take it as far as say,
you know,
the Mit blackjack team.
Um,

743
00:39:06.550 --> 00:39:11.170
but they,
uh,
they,
uh,
they,
maybe they could've been with,
this is just,

744
00:39:11.171 --> 00:39:15.260
this is what the Shannon does with the sort of freedom that he gets to be a,
uh,

745
00:39:15.510 --> 00:39:18.520
uh,
to be at a tinkerer,
prankster,
a jokester.
Oh.

746
00:39:18.521 --> 00:39:22.270
And he also builds an earlier Chetland computer are called end game that can

747
00:39:22.271 --> 00:39:26.110
handle a six pieces.
Um,
so,
you know,

748
00:39:26.111 --> 00:39:29.800
he's all over the place in terms of his,
our hobbies,
um,
projects.

749
00:39:29.801 --> 00:39:31.150
We can go on and on with this list.

750
00:39:31.151 --> 00:39:33.040
But that's what it sort of makes them such a fun character.

751
00:39:33.070 --> 00:39:36.460
And we think it's obviously you can,

752
00:39:36.461 --> 00:39:38.170
you speculate a bit of when you write a biography,

753
00:39:38.171 --> 00:39:40.990
but you think that that there's this playful spirit that even when he's not

754
00:39:40.991 --> 00:39:42.700
unicycling down the hallway at bell labs,

755
00:39:42.940 --> 00:39:45.820
it's in his work too because he was the kind of guy that just ask the silly

756
00:39:45.821 --> 00:39:47.960
questions and got so much out of them.
Uh,

757
00:39:48.030 --> 00:39:51.670
and it was sort of that courage to ask the ridiculous questions that enabled him

758
00:39:51.671 --> 00:39:53.740
to do what he did.
It,
it's worth also,
right just

759
00:39:53.740 --> 00:39:57.790
<v 0>emphasizing at least using one example with the roulette,
a wearable device.</v>

760
00:39:58.060 --> 00:39:58.821
So the,

761
00:39:58.821 --> 00:40:03.730
the origin story of this is Ed Thorp is at Mit and he tries to get an audience

762
00:40:03.731 --> 00:40:05.500
with Claude Shannon.
He does.

763
00:40:05.501 --> 00:40:08.320
And the Secretary Warren's in like collage hand and doesn't really have a lot of

764
00:40:08.321 --> 00:40:09.730
patients.
So just you know,
keep your,

765
00:40:09.820 --> 00:40:13.870
keep your stuff brief and he goes in and he's asking him about a blackjack paper

766
00:40:13.871 --> 00:40:16.660
that he had written and Claude Shannon advised him that he wants to get it

767
00:40:16.661 --> 00:40:20.830
published.
He needs to just change the name slightly and then [inaudible].

768
00:40:20.890 --> 00:40:24.070
So what else are you working on and at dark sort of intimate said he's got this

769
00:40:24.071 --> 00:40:29.071
idea for a roulette roulette wearable device that could give you a slight

770
00:40:29.351 --> 00:40:30.850
advantage against the house and Roulette.

771
00:40:31.450 --> 00:40:35.440
They spend the next eight months working to make this a reality.

772
00:40:35.770 --> 00:40:38.350
They buy clutch in and buys a regulation,

773
00:40:38.380 --> 00:40:41.200
let table from some warehouse or something.

774
00:40:41.350 --> 00:40:45.700
They install it at the house and Ed Thorp for a period of time moves in and so

775
00:40:45.701 --> 00:40:49.710
they just work on this thing.
These are two MIT professors like they,
yeah,

776
00:40:49.820 --> 00:40:52.750
and Claude Shannon's like a duck giant was in the field by this point.

777
00:40:52.840 --> 00:40:55.120
There's been eight months playing with the roulette ball and trying to figure

778
00:40:55.121 --> 00:40:58.630
out sort of what the mechanics then as if that weren't enough,

779
00:40:58.750 --> 00:41:01.840
they take the device to Las Vegas to to actually test it.

780
00:41:02.080 --> 00:41:06.160
I think that one of the things that I am most inspired by about Claude Shannon

781
00:41:06.310 --> 00:41:08.950
is just how far he took these curiosities.
I mean,

782
00:41:08.951 --> 00:41:13.390
how many of us have an idea and it sort of goes into the trash.
It's like,

783
00:41:13.391 --> 00:41:16.780
that's neat.
Okay,
I'm not going to devote eight months to try to do this.

784
00:41:16.781 --> 00:41:20.550
But this student was a perfect stranger to Claude Shannon.
He didn't know him.

785
00:41:20.710 --> 00:41:22.060
This is the first time they'd ever met.

786
00:41:22.270 --> 00:41:24.550
And that leads to an eight month collaboration,

787
00:41:24.970 --> 00:41:28.600
which just goes to show the sort of thing that happens when an idea entered

788
00:41:28.601 --> 00:41:31.510
Claude Shannon's head,
sort of what could have emerged from it.

789
00:41:31.511 --> 00:41:34.370
And we have physical representations of all of those things.

790
00:41:34.371 --> 00:41:37.450
A lot of these devices are still stored at the MIT museum.
Uh,

791
00:41:37.460 --> 00:41:40.370
they went on tour last year and to Germany and they were exhibited.

792
00:41:40.680 --> 00:41:45.060
I think he's one of the only people that I've ever read of who has both papers

793
00:41:45.080 --> 00:41:49.140
published in academic journals and things that have been in museums.
Uh,

794
00:41:49.680 --> 00:41:51.020
this is a,
this is who he was.

795
00:41:51.021 --> 00:41:54.680
It's a big part of the latter part of his life is this kind of tinkering.

796
00:41:54.710 --> 00:41:56.180
And I think there's,
uh,

797
00:41:56.270 --> 00:42:01.270
people like to say that the latter part of his life wasn't as productive or that

798
00:42:01.851 --> 00:42:06.410
he didn't achieve what he did in 1948 and he kind of went downhill.

799
00:42:06.620 --> 00:42:10.070
Um,
but,
but if you think about what you're comparing it to,

800
00:42:10.310 --> 00:42:13.520
like the 1948 paper was extraordinary.
I mean,
it,
it has,

801
00:42:13.640 --> 00:42:17.450
people have referred to it as sort of Einstein or Newton level thinking to say

802
00:42:17.451 --> 00:42:21.620
that what he did after that didn't quite meet up match up,
I think is,
is a,

803
00:42:21.621 --> 00:42:24.230
you're setting an extraordinarily high bar,
but B,

804
00:42:24.470 --> 00:42:28.310
it misses all of these things that he did do.
The devices that he built,

805
00:42:28.460 --> 00:42:33.020
he continued writing papers that took some of the theoretical work from 1948 and

806
00:42:33.200 --> 00:42:35.270
showed engineers how they can practically apply it.

807
00:42:35.390 --> 00:42:38.360
It's a period in which he's mentoring and working with some of the younger

808
00:42:38.361 --> 00:42:42.380
generation of information theorists,
people like Robert Fannow and Bob Gallagher,

809
00:42:42.570 --> 00:42:46.460
um,
who work with him on papers about pulse code modulation and other things.

810
00:42:46.700 --> 00:42:49.940
And so there's this,
uh,
this period in the latter part of his life though,

811
00:42:49.941 --> 00:42:54.380
which has a lot more freedom and flexibility and a lot of his most inventive

812
00:42:54.381 --> 00:42:56.450
things come out of come out of that phase of his life and

813
00:42:57.260 --> 00:42:57.820
<v 2>wanted to add,</v>

814
00:42:57.820 --> 00:43:00.930
we did a Reddit Ama a couple of days ago and in the middle of it a guy emailed

815
00:43:00.931 --> 00:43:01.711
me and said,
oh,

816
00:43:01.711 --> 00:43:04.840
you have a picture in your book of Shannon's a juggling clown Diorama.
Uh,

817
00:43:04.890 --> 00:43:05.680
he had a couple of these,

818
00:43:05.680 --> 00:43:08.220
some of the juggling and life from that just look like it.
Uh,

819
00:43:08.221 --> 00:43:09.760
I helped to build that.
I was a,

820
00:43:10.290 --> 00:43:12.510
I think a high school student at the time and it was like saying it was such a

821
00:43:12.511 --> 00:43:13.344
nice guy and it was,

822
00:43:13.410 --> 00:43:16.200
it was one of the fun of summers of my life working with him and his workshop on

823
00:43:16.201 --> 00:43:20.160
this.
And he sent us a picture of as proof of kind of like old Shannon in the,

824
00:43:20.161 --> 00:43:22.410
I think this must've been the 70s,
early eighties.

825
00:43:22.650 --> 00:43:25.260
And this a high school kid and you got the Ama.
It was awesome.

826
00:43:25.320 --> 00:43:26.760
But it was just when he,

827
00:43:26.761 --> 00:43:29.820
when he latched onto a project or someone who was interested in the same things,

828
00:43:29.930 --> 00:43:31.500
uh,
you know,
he did it.
He made it.

829
00:43:31.910 --> 00:43:33.880
<v 0>He built an Rv.
I mean,
he,
like he,</v>

830
00:43:33.910 --> 00:43:38.480
so they bought an old school bus and like retrofitted it as an RV and there's

831
00:43:38.490 --> 00:43:43.000
some accounts that suggests that it's like the world's first RV.
Um,
but,

832
00:43:43.001 --> 00:43:45.910
but they just,
they,
those,
the Shannon's and Betty in particular,

833
00:43:46.150 --> 00:43:47.620
and we should actually talk about her too,

834
00:43:47.621 --> 00:43:50.470
because she's a huge part of this story.
His wife,

835
00:43:50.471 --> 00:43:55.060
Betty is his equal in intellect in but also in tinkering.

836
00:43:55.240 --> 00:43:56.320
So Theseus the mouse,

837
00:43:56.321 --> 00:43:59.200
the video we watched the wiring for that was actually Betty.

838
00:43:59.201 --> 00:44:01.870
Betty did the wiring.
That's a story we learn later.

839
00:44:02.390 --> 00:44:05.170
Chan and gets the credit and deservedly so.
It was,

840
00:44:05.200 --> 00:44:07.710
he was sort of thinking about it,
but Betty made sure the wire,

841
00:44:07.750 --> 00:44:09.820
the wiring would work in that the thing would work as it needed to.

842
00:44:09.821 --> 00:44:11.770
They were full partners in a lot of what they did.

843
00:44:11.980 --> 00:44:15.220
We wrote a piece about this in scientific American that debuted a couple of days

844
00:44:15.220 --> 00:44:19.060
ago.
And,
um,
have heard back from,
from people who knew Shannon to say,
you know,

845
00:44:19.061 --> 00:44:22.030
thank goodness Benny finally kind of gets the credit that she deserves for a lot

846
00:44:22.031 --> 00:44:22.241
of this.

847
00:44:22.241 --> 00:44:25.390
She pushed him to try things like getting interested in the stock market,

848
00:44:25.391 --> 00:44:29.710
which he becomes obsessed with for a brief period.
Um,
it,
it,
the,

849
00:44:30.040 --> 00:44:32.160
he had this,
this quality of being

850
00:44:32.160 --> 00:44:36.090
<v 2>able to,
uh,
ask this sort of absurd question,</v>

851
00:44:36.210 --> 00:44:40.640
but then try to build the answer to the absurd question.
Um,
and so there,

852
00:44:40.641 --> 00:44:41.580
there were just robots.

853
00:44:41.581 --> 00:44:44.750
He builds to perform functions that you sort of think to yourself,
like,
why,

854
00:44:44.751 --> 00:44:48.780
why would you do?
Why,
why would you do that?
Um,
but the,
yeah,
so that,

855
00:44:48.800 --> 00:44:51.110
that's just a little bit of a digression.
Not at all.

856
00:44:51.210 --> 00:44:53.490
I was going to go into what about the women in this story,

857
00:44:53.640 --> 00:44:55.530
but that could be a whole nother hour,
I think.

858
00:44:55.740 --> 00:44:58.140
And I want to give the people here a chance to ask some questions.

859
00:44:58.440 --> 00:45:00.660
So it's your turn.
Do you have some questions?

860
00:45:02.930 --> 00:45:06.510
How would Claude Shannon described himself?
Um,

861
00:45:07.800 --> 00:45:11.130
he wouldn't want to,
yeah,
that's a good one.
He was always,
yeah,
that,

862
00:45:11.131 --> 00:45:14.730
that's a good point.
Is that in interviews,
uh,
he was just sort of an invasive,

863
00:45:14.760 --> 00:45:16.620
a humble guy.
He didn't really,
he said,
well,

864
00:45:16.621 --> 00:45:18.990
that just seemed like a pretty simple idea to me at the time.
Just came to me.

865
00:45:19.410 --> 00:45:23.580
But I guess he would describe himself as someone who,
uh,
who liked puzzles,

866
00:45:23.581 --> 00:45:26.570
who'd like to think about the way things worked.
Um,

867
00:45:27.180 --> 00:45:28.830
and I think that kind of undersells who we was,

868
00:45:28.831 --> 00:45:33.120
but I think you would have described himself in,
in pretty minimalist terms.
Uh,

869
00:45:33.150 --> 00:45:35.760
there are a couple of interesting moments where Claude Shannon gets a little

870
00:45:35.761 --> 00:45:37.310
more autobiographical.
Uh,

871
00:45:37.380 --> 00:45:40.780
one thing that we've dug up from the archives was papers,
uh,
was a,
uh,

872
00:45:40.800 --> 00:45:44.430
1950 to talk.
He gives on the topic of creative thinking to,
uh,
to bell labs,

873
00:45:44.520 --> 00:45:45.710
engineers.
Oh,
in there,

874
00:45:45.720 --> 00:45:48.140
there was one quote that we really like for him that we kind of mythical made it

875
00:45:48.150 --> 00:45:51.480
the chapter title.
He said that,
um,
uh,

876
00:45:52.350 --> 00:45:57.180
creative thinkers have this sort of,
um,
productive dissatisfaction.
They just,

877
00:45:57.181 --> 00:46:00.480
they see when things don't fit right or don't work quite or puzzling and they

878
00:46:00.481 --> 00:46:01.890
just stick with it to any follow through.

879
00:46:01.891 --> 00:46:04.560
So I think he described himself as someone who was sort of usefully irritated in

880
00:46:04.561 --> 00:46:09.090
a way sometimes.
Um,
he also,
uh,
much later on,

881
00:46:09.480 --> 00:46:12.570
um,
uh,
when he wins the Kyoto prize,

882
00:46:12.571 --> 00:46:15.840
which was sort of a set up as a a rivaled the Nobel prize in some fields the

883
00:46:15.841 --> 00:46:16.591
Nobel didn't cover,

884
00:46:16.591 --> 00:46:20.340
including a math which Claude Shannon gets a much later in his life.

885
00:46:20.341 --> 00:46:23.090
He gives us sort of a hopeful view of his life,
talking about the,

886
00:46:23.091 --> 00:46:27.520
of the progression of computers from a slide rules,
uh,
to the,
uh,
to the apple TV,

887
00:46:27.550 --> 00:46:31.710
which he had many talks about.
Um,
uh,

888
00:46:32.760 --> 00:46:35.890
how much he had gotten intellectualized pursuing his hobbies that he just

889
00:46:36.150 --> 00:46:39.060
describes itself as a hobbyist and a lot of ways and how this was such an

890
00:46:39.061 --> 00:46:43.020
integral part of his work.
So we gave a big a block quote of that speech in the,

891
00:46:43.021 --> 00:46:43.860
uh,
uh,

892
00:46:43.920 --> 00:46:46.260
in the book just because it hadn't been widely published and there aren't very

893
00:46:46.261 --> 00:46:48.140
meantime to Shannon would open up about himself.

894
00:46:48.141 --> 00:46:51.210
He was actually very nervous representing himself in public.

895
00:46:51.330 --> 00:46:54.240
He gave the inaugural Claude Shannon and lecture,
um,

896
00:46:54.270 --> 00:46:59.190
I think it was in Tel Aviv at the Technion.
Escalona Ashkelon.
Yeah.
Um,

897
00:46:59.220 --> 00:47:01.890
and,
uh,
if someone said I had never used a nervous wreck,

898
00:47:01.891 --> 00:47:05.010
it was named after him and,
uh,
he was being honored and you know,
he,

899
00:47:05.011 --> 00:47:07.440
I think he was at the bar like pounding a couple of old fashion before he went

900
00:47:07.441 --> 00:47:10.410
up there just because he did not like to represent himself in public.

901
00:47:10.411 --> 00:47:14.040
So when he did,
it was worth,
it was worth pulling out.

902
00:47:14.330 --> 00:47:17.200
That's a bit of a long winded answer,
but,
uh,
there,

903
00:47:17.230 --> 00:47:19.390
there's another piece to that too,
which is,
um,

904
00:47:19.410 --> 00:47:22.490
in the creative thinking lecture that he gives,
uh,

905
00:47:22.860 --> 00:47:26.130
one of the things that nearly every person who we spoke to you about him when we

906
00:47:26.131 --> 00:47:30.820
spoke to a lot of people who knew him,
he was incredibly

907
00:47:30.820 --> 00:47:35.050
<v 0>modest.
Um,
all in a way,
almost modest to a fault.</v>

908
00:47:35.570 --> 00:47:38.230
He did not go out and seek adulation.

909
00:47:38.570 --> 00:47:42.100
Envelopes would come with awards or within invitations to speak at procedures,

910
00:47:42.101 --> 00:47:43.630
lectures.
He would put them,

911
00:47:43.660 --> 00:47:46.630
many of them and have been called letters I've procrastinated on sending back

912
00:47:46.631 --> 00:47:50.920
for too long.
Um,
Eh,
awards,
honors recognitions.
It just,

913
00:47:50.921 --> 00:47:54.430
it had no effect on him.
Uh,
there was even a reluctance in him.

914
00:47:54.460 --> 00:47:57.330
I remember hearing from Peggy about the,

915
00:47:57.340 --> 00:48:00.880
they found out that their dad had won the National Medal of science and that it

916
00:48:00.881 --> 00:48:04.360
was sort of a,
it was a lift to get them to like kind of go to DC,

917
00:48:04.370 --> 00:48:05.260
do the whole thing.

918
00:48:05.261 --> 00:48:08.920
It was a famous photo of him and shaking Lyndon Johnson's hand.
Um,
there,

919
00:48:09.290 --> 00:48:14.290
there are times when he wins awards and he just stashes them away when an

920
00:48:14.621 --> 00:48:16.330
interviewer is asking about an award.

921
00:48:16.450 --> 00:48:20.630
I think this was from an unpublished interview we uncovered.
Um,
he says,
well,

922
00:48:20.650 --> 00:48:22.460
I have a couple of dozen of these things in the other room,
but,

923
00:48:22.461 --> 00:48:24.130
but let's get back to the matter at hand,

924
00:48:24.131 --> 00:48:27.250
which is sort of problem solving and understanding how things work.

925
00:48:27.490 --> 00:48:30.400
You had this great line that we love that's uh,
if I can solve,

926
00:48:30.430 --> 00:48:34.660
if I can find a solution to a mathematical theory,
I get a big bang out of it.
Um,

927
00:48:34.810 --> 00:48:36.930
and he says it with like an exclamation point.
Uh,

928
00:48:36.931 --> 00:48:41.931
and I think that the sort of self effacing modest quality of Shannon is

929
00:48:42.761 --> 00:48:46.660
connected to this sort of not being affected by awards and honors.

930
00:48:46.661 --> 00:48:51.200
And what that allows him to do is be free to explore whatever he wants.
Um,

931
00:48:51.220 --> 00:48:55.230
he never feels a trace of self consciousness being the guy who founded

932
00:48:55.240 --> 00:48:55.880
mathematical,

933
00:48:55.880 --> 00:49:00.250
mathematical theory of communication and the guy who juggles in unicycles and

934
00:49:00.251 --> 00:49:02.710
plays with children's toys,
uh,
this is just not,

935
00:49:02.740 --> 00:49:06.610
it's not something that affects him.
Meanwhile,
many of his colleagues do wonder.

936
00:49:06.611 --> 00:49:09.990
They're like,
this is a,
he,
you know,
he's too,
he's a named chair at Mit.

937
00:49:09.991 --> 00:49:13.680
He's supposed to,
he's supposed to act a certain way.
Um,
we,

938
00:49:13.740 --> 00:49:16.600
we find some inspiration in the fact that he didn't act that way,

939
00:49:16.601 --> 00:49:20.920
that he just pursued what interested in interested him most.
So in a way,

940
00:49:20.950 --> 00:49:23.380
if he had asked if he was going to be asset to describe himself,

941
00:49:23.410 --> 00:49:26.530
I think it would if he was forced to do it and if he'd be forced,

942
00:49:26.560 --> 00:49:27.820
he would say he was a problem solver.

943
00:49:27.850 --> 00:49:30.360
That he enjoyed solving problems and figuring things out.
Uh,

944
00:49:30.430 --> 00:49:35.020
but what he happened to figure out or things and things and problems that affect

945
00:49:35.021 --> 00:49:39.730
us still.
You mentioned earlier that I was going to ask about,
uh,

946
00:49:40.020 --> 00:49:43.080
these are people that influence Shannon,
but Shannon influenced to other people.

947
00:49:43.080 --> 00:49:46.320
We know club Levy Strauss was a neighbor and then the series had effect on him.

948
00:49:46.321 --> 00:49:47.220
I know that Leonard Meyer,

949
00:49:47.221 --> 00:49:51.060
the philosopher I'm music considers the implications of the information theory

950
00:49:51.061 --> 00:49:52.230
on here at music.

951
00:49:52.231 --> 00:49:55.530
But you also mentioned that you didn't put in the book because there's a story

952
00:49:55.531 --> 00:50:00.300
about an encounter with Steve jobs and seeing that the opera just premiered this

953
00:50:00.300 --> 00:50:03.630
weekend in Santa Fe might be timely to hear about Shannon and jobs before we

954
00:50:03.631 --> 00:50:07.910
have to cure.
Sure.
Um,
so this is a,
it's a,
it's a great story.
Uh,

955
00:50:08.060 --> 00:50:09.490
this is the 1980s,

956
00:50:09.580 --> 00:50:13.840
both jobs and Shannon are being given honorary degrees at the University of

957
00:50:13.841 --> 00:50:17.950
Pennsylvania.
Um,
and again,
we sort of think about this like for Shannon,

958
00:50:18.250 --> 00:50:22.090
he had so many honorary degrees did he actually rigged up a rotating tie rack,

959
00:50:22.120 --> 00:50:24.910
which you put all the hoods on just to,
this is like how he thought,

960
00:50:24.911 --> 00:50:27.270
how insignificant he thought these things were for the referral.

961
00:50:27.330 --> 00:50:29.450
The rest of us by winter honorary degree,
I mean,

962
00:50:29.451 --> 00:50:31.310
I want people to see that moment.
I walked through the front door,

963
00:50:31.340 --> 00:50:35.550
I'm wearing the thing like,
yeah,
I want to wear the hood permanently for Santa.

964
00:50:35.551 --> 00:50:38.090
And she's like,
Hey,
oh,
another honorary degree.
Here we go.

965
00:50:38.390 --> 00:50:41.210
So they go to the University of Pennsylvania.
And,
uh,
at this point,

966
00:50:41.211 --> 00:50:46.130
jobs is well known because of apple,
but not quite the sort of canonical figure,

967
00:50:46.131 --> 00:50:50.120
iconic figure he is now.
And so after the ceremony is over,

968
00:50:50.121 --> 00:50:51.620
everybody's sort of milling about the quad.

969
00:50:51.680 --> 00:50:56.210
And Shannon has a group of people that random because Shannon is doctor Claude

970
00:50:56.210 --> 00:50:58.460
Shannon and the people in this,
in that space know who he is.

971
00:50:58.820 --> 00:51:02.420
He's got this throng of people around him and Steve Jobs really doesn't he?

972
00:51:02.421 --> 00:51:03.810
He knows who Dr. Shannon is.

973
00:51:03.830 --> 00:51:07.850
So he tries to elbow his way into an audience with and Janet and he does and he

974
00:51:07.851 --> 00:51:11.860
gets up to him.
And the story according to Shannon's daughter is roughly that,
um,

975
00:51:11.960 --> 00:51:14.880
Steve Jobs says,
uh,
talked to Shannon is such an honor to meet you.
Uh,

976
00:51:14.930 --> 00:51:19.890
my name is Steve Jobs.
I work at Apple and Claude Shannon says,
well,
Steve,

977
00:51:19.960 --> 00:51:24.860
it's great to meet you.
What do you do at Apple?
Uh,
uh,
and I,
and,

978
00:51:24.861 --> 00:51:28.250
and the,
the end of the encounter,
uh,
as best as we can tell,

979
00:51:28.251 --> 00:51:32.750
is that Steve Jobs actually sends the Shannon's and apple two e that he himself

980
00:51:32.751 --> 00:51:36.590
assembled.
Uh,
and so they had this in there.
It had a pride of place in their,

981
00:51:36.591 --> 00:51:39.770
in their home.
Um,
but it was a,
all of that,

982
00:51:39.771 --> 00:51:43.310
the sort of recognition and fame and a sort of celebrity,
oh,

983
00:51:43.340 --> 00:51:46.130
it was not really lost on Jen and it wasn't when he was after.
In fact,

984
00:51:46.131 --> 00:51:49.670
in a way some of the commercialization of things we've sort of lost on Shannon

985
00:51:49.671 --> 00:51:50.210
too.

986
00:51:50.210 --> 00:51:54.030
It never struck him that he ought to like build a company and take it public.
Uh,

987
00:51:54.050 --> 00:51:57.130
he was always just interested in sort of pursuing his own private curiosities.

988
00:51:57.131 --> 00:51:59.870
But we did love investing in other people,
public company.
He did.
He did.

989
00:51:59.871 --> 00:52:01.910
And he got,
he was wealthy by the end of his life.

990
00:52:02.090 --> 00:52:04.400
Got on the ground floor of a number of,
of early companies,

991
00:52:04.401 --> 00:52:07.160
including one that was acquired by Hewlett Packard.
Um,

992
00:52:07.400 --> 00:52:10.220
I believe actually new Hewlett and Packard,
if I remember correctly.

993
00:52:10.221 --> 00:52:14.060
But in any case,
that's the sort of famous Steve jobs and Dr. Shannon moment,

994
00:52:14.061 --> 00:52:16.310
which is that at that moment in history,

995
00:52:16.580 --> 00:52:20.660
Steve jobs had to explain to clutch and who he was,
uh,
which is pretty cool.
Well,

996
00:52:20.661 --> 00:52:23.630
thank you so much for coming and thank you for writing the book.

997
00:52:23.720 --> 00:52:24.553
Thank you so much.

998
00:52:28.040 --> 00:52:28.570
<v 1>Thank you so much.</v>
