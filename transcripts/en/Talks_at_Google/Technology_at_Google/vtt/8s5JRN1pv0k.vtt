WEBVTT

1
00:00:06.080 --> 00:00:09.110
Thanks everybody for coming.
I'm really excited for this talk,

2
00:00:09.111 --> 00:00:12.970
that surveillance going to do for us.
Uh,
we have a few people here from Cervelo.

3
00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:16.040
I had stu,
David and Shawn,

4
00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:18.800
less steel and Dave will be doing most of the talking.

5
00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:22.070
We also have Sarah p on piano and who's here,
who just finished Kona,

6
00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:24.590
second American woman.
Very exciting.

7
00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:31.860
And we also have under it oh glue from beyond Arrow who works with,

8
00:00:31.861 --> 00:00:35.310
he's been working with Mila for about 10 years now I think in various aspects.

9
00:00:35.311 --> 00:00:39.180
So he has a bike shop at beyond Arrow and I'm going to turn it on over.

10
00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:43.600
<v 2>All right.
Thank you very much.
Hi everybody.</v>

11
00:00:45.010 --> 00:00:46.360
Thanks for having us here today.

12
00:00:46.900 --> 00:00:51.040
My Name is David and this is stu and we're designers from Cervelo.

13
00:00:51.670 --> 00:00:55.900
Um,
we just got back from Kona,
Hawaii,
um,

14
00:00:56.230 --> 00:00:57.160
pretty tough job

15
00:00:59.140 --> 00:01:01.660
where we launched our new p five x,

16
00:01:01.661 --> 00:01:04.900
which is our top and triathlon specific bike.

17
00:01:05.620 --> 00:01:10.420
And what we want to do today is take you through the design process of that bike

18
00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:14.590
and some of the cool features that we have on that project.

19
00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:19.720
So to start,
uh,
we'll,
we'll take you back three years ago,

20
00:01:20.410 --> 00:01:22.510
um,
when we first started this project,

21
00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:28.140
we had our p five triathlon and tt bike on the market.

22
00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:30.430
And for us,

23
00:01:30.431 --> 00:01:34.390
that bike was originally designed primarily as a TT bike.

24
00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:39.580
Now is anybody here watch the Tour de France?
Yes.
So you know,

25
00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:45.070
in that,
in that circuit of racing,
you have a section of the,

26
00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:50.140
the event where you're individually racing bikes on your own and you're being

27
00:01:50.141 --> 00:01:54.730
timed on how fast you do that.
But for that rider on the left,

28
00:01:55.860 --> 00:02:00.190
the,
you're,
you're essentially getting out of the team bus,

29
00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:02.860
but getting put on your bike,
you do your event,

30
00:02:03.190 --> 00:02:06.730
you get off the bike and you know,
you're back in the bus kind of thing.

31
00:02:07.660 --> 00:02:08.493
On the right,

32
00:02:08.740 --> 00:02:13.630
we have a travel Martel doing a triathlon.

33
00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:18.910
Uh,
he's one of our pros on the same bike and you can see the positions,
right?

34
00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:22.210
Or actually quite similar,
but the usage is very different.

35
00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:27.040
Trevor,
he's got a pack his own bike,
get it to the event.

36
00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:32.470
He's got to carry all his tools and all his food on the bike with him.
Um,

37
00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:36.720
he doesn't have a team bus,
um,
at the end of the day.
Um,

38
00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:41.560
so there's a lot more going on for that rider.
And we realized that,

39
00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:44.350
you know,
this,
the p five was doing these two different,

40
00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:49.560
very different purposes and we wanted to try and address triathlons

41
00:02:50.371 --> 00:02:52.390
specifically.
We saw there is a need there.

42
00:02:53.830 --> 00:02:55.400
So the goal for this book,

43
00:02:55.480 --> 00:02:59.710
for this project was essentially designed the ultimate bike

44
00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:06.100
<v 3>and,
and that's really how we started.
Very wide open project goal.</v>

45
00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:10.180
So then how did we start?
Uh,
yeah,

46
00:03:10.181 --> 00:03:13.090
so I'm trying to start from scratch.

47
00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:15.430
We started data mining is the way to go.

48
00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:20.620
We went to through studying the rules of triathlon.

49
00:03:20.740 --> 00:03:25.740
So there's many federations across the world that have slight changes in the

50
00:03:25.931 --> 00:03:28.000
rules depending on,
on where they are.

51
00:03:28.001 --> 00:03:32.410
So we wanted to make sure that we knew what we could do with the bike from a,

52
00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:36.520
and actually have them be able to race them.
Uh,
we studied,
uh,

53
00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:41.130
triathlon courses across the world.
We interviewed retailers and,
uh,

54
00:03:41.380 --> 00:03:43.510
we also interview industry experts.

55
00:03:45.880 --> 00:03:50.080
So we went to a few different,
um,
triathlons,
again,
globally,

56
00:03:50.081 --> 00:03:54.740
trying to capture the essence of triathlon and Ironman,
um,
across the,

57
00:03:54.760 --> 00:03:59.260
across the world.
Um,
and we,
we,
uh,
we took some,

58
00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:04.090
we took actually a 15,000 photos of different writers at all of these races,

59
00:04:04.780 --> 00:04:06.260
all at a side view.
Uh,

60
00:04:06.520 --> 00:04:10.220
some examples we can just fire through and you can see that there was some,

61
00:04:10.330 --> 00:04:13.660
some very unique setups and each rider is quite different and it's some,

62
00:04:13.661 --> 00:04:18.370
some of the things that we've noticed throughout those 15,000 photos,
uh,

63
00:04:18.610 --> 00:04:23.360
very unique stuff.
So even even,
um,
I'm surprised we didn't see a Google bike,
uh,

64
00:04:23.610 --> 00:04:28.170
and one of these races.
But,
but yeah,
people like to do these races for a,

65
00:04:28.180 --> 00:04:32.340
you know,
for charities,
which is,
this gentleman has done,
um,
I may,

66
00:04:32.410 --> 00:04:35.680
ironman Nice.
Um,
iron man.
He's one of the,

67
00:04:35.710 --> 00:04:40.630
one of the most challenging bike course races and he ended it on this bike,
so,

68
00:04:40.720 --> 00:04:42.340
so pretty cool.
Also lots of storage.

69
00:04:42.341 --> 00:04:47.200
So we've got some good ideas for that as well.
And,
uh,

70
00:04:48.460 --> 00:04:49.870
so from these pictures we were,

71
00:04:49.990 --> 00:04:54.990
we really wanted to use them to develop and capture some objective data,

72
00:04:55.121 --> 00:04:58.590
some data that we could use throughout the development process.
Um,

73
00:04:59.140 --> 00:05:02.440
so again,
we took pictures from the side view,

74
00:05:02.441 --> 00:05:07.030
so we were able to compare every single picture,
Tu,
Tu,
Tu to all of the others.

75
00:05:07.530 --> 00:05:10.150
Um,
regs,
for instance.
Uh,

76
00:05:10.780 --> 00:05:14.980
we could determine where people stored a nutrition and they're flat gets on

77
00:05:14.981 --> 00:05:17.200
their bikes.
So here we have a,
just a list.

78
00:05:17.201 --> 00:05:20.710
I don't know if you guys can read that bunch of different areas on the bike

79
00:05:20.711 --> 00:05:25.150
where people stored bikes and we'd try to determine the percentage of,

80
00:05:25.420 --> 00:05:30.250
of each of each preferred area for storage.
Um,
you can just flip it.

81
00:05:30.251 --> 00:05:31.084
Yeah.

82
00:05:31.150 --> 00:05:35.770
So here's an example of a data that we were able to use forward in our,

83
00:05:35.771 --> 00:05:37.520
uh,
in our development.
Uh,

84
00:05:37.790 --> 00:05:42.790
we discovered that the most common placement for storage or for nutrition in

85
00:05:42.791 --> 00:05:47.620
this,
in this case was on the front of the top deep.
Um,
and so that's,
you know,

86
00:05:48.250 --> 00:05:51.790
development,
development,
development and result.
Um,
okay.

87
00:05:53.140 --> 00:05:55.570
Alright.
So we also,
um,

88
00:05:56.020 --> 00:06:00.440
study those photos along with the interviews of athletes and,

89
00:06:00.800 --> 00:06:04.670
and industry professionals to determine,
uh,
how many,

90
00:06:04.671 --> 00:06:09.410
how many bottles people rode with on the race week.
We found out that,
uh,

91
00:06:09.620 --> 00:06:12.910
you have this graph shows a,
you know,

92
00:06:12.920 --> 00:06:16.940
there's actually 8% of people for those of you have done trap on this gentleman

93
00:06:16.941 --> 00:06:19.270
said he had done a couple.
Um,

94
00:06:19.730 --> 00:06:22.580
there's people out there that's that ride with no bottles,
no hydration,

95
00:06:23.080 --> 00:06:25.740
just pretty interesting.
But I'm not sure how you feel about that.
Um,

96
00:06:26.150 --> 00:06:30.260
there was obviously more,
more commonly,
there was one bottle,

97
00:06:30.261 --> 00:06:34.760
33% of people carried out of,
out of t one,
two bottles,

98
00:06:34.790 --> 00:06:36.860
46%,
three bottles,
12%.

99
00:06:36.860 --> 00:06:41.660
So almost a hundred percent of the people would carry up to three bottles.

100
00:06:41.930 --> 00:06:44.960
So that was something we were able to use going forward as a benchmark.

101
00:06:46.170 --> 00:06:49.220
We were also able to,
um,
this was pretty,

102
00:06:49.250 --> 00:06:52.670
cause this is kind of my favorite part of the data analysis.
Um,

103
00:06:52.780 --> 00:06:53.690
we're able to hit these,

104
00:06:53.710 --> 00:06:58.130
these side view photos and calibrate them to uh,

105
00:06:58.770 --> 00:07:03.520
um,
basically overlay them and actually measure,
um,
geometry.
Uh,

106
00:07:03.680 --> 00:07:06.740
or sorry,
fit.
Um,
so he,
as an example,
we could,

107
00:07:06.741 --> 00:07:08.720
we could find the seat post relative,

108
00:07:08.721 --> 00:07:13.000
see post height and the CFO and I'm sorry to satellite and see posts angle,
um,

109
00:07:13.270 --> 00:07:18.230
stack in reach of,
of up to,
of all the writers in our,
in our,

110
00:07:18.231 --> 00:07:21.530
in our data set.
So really good,
useful information,

111
00:07:22.040 --> 00:07:26.270
real information that we were able to make sure that we catered to in the

112
00:07:26.271 --> 00:07:30.530
development.
So,
um,
this gentleman here was a,

113
00:07:30.590 --> 00:07:35.150
represents our most common like set up.
Um,
we see he's,

114
00:07:35.510 --> 00:07:39.830
he's one of several in his category and not that many.
Um,

115
00:07:40.670 --> 00:07:45.140
and what he is his Arrow bottle between the arms,
a Bento bag behind the stem,

116
00:07:46.100 --> 00:07:50.510
a bank behind a saddle and a round bottle on the down tube.
So that's,

117
00:07:50.511 --> 00:07:55.370
those are four things that were most commonly used and placed on the bike.
Um,

118
00:07:55.400 --> 00:07:58.250
throughout our,
our analysis.
And how,

119
00:07:58.300 --> 00:08:00.680
I got a question for the people in the audience here.

120
00:08:00.681 --> 00:08:04.100
How common do you think that that most common setup was out of,

121
00:08:04.130 --> 00:08:08.000
out of all of the,
uh,
the selected photos that we,
that we studied.

122
00:08:08.550 --> 00:08:12.320
Can anyone guess 95%.
Was that

123
00:08:15.310 --> 00:08:20.150
on the,
on the right track?
Yeah,
it was actually less than 4%.

124
00:08:21.470 --> 00:08:23.480
Right.
So yeah,

125
00:08:24.620 --> 00:08:27.590
our senior engineer used to present this part and he would kick the guy that

126
00:08:27.591 --> 00:08:32.060
said 95% out of the room because he was,
he was,
uh,

127
00:08:32.080 --> 00:08:36.620
he was so off.
But no,
you can stay.
Um,
right.

128
00:08:36.621 --> 00:08:40.880
So three,
3.8% had that,
that set up.
So what did that tell us?

129
00:08:41.750 --> 00:08:45.440
Oh,
sorry.
And,
uh,
I'll,
I've,
all of the setups that we,
that we studied,

130
00:08:45.500 --> 00:08:49.520
there was 688 unique,
unique configurations.

131
00:08:50.360 --> 00:08:53.180
And so this was again,
something we want to use moving forward.

132
00:08:53.181 --> 00:08:56.820
We knew that the bike that we designed for triathlon,

133
00:08:57.140 --> 00:08:59.730
you needed to accommodate a lot of different needs.

134
00:09:01.970 --> 00:09:02.820
Uh,
nutrition.

135
00:09:02.821 --> 00:09:07.020
We wanted to make sure that we had enough nutrition on the bike to support,
um,

136
00:09:07.230 --> 00:09:09.650
a full ironman distance.
Uh,

137
00:09:09.810 --> 00:09:12.920
we designated a volume in the,

138
00:09:12.921 --> 00:09:17.730
in the top tube area for that could hold the almost 1600 calories of nutrition

139
00:09:18.240 --> 00:09:22.920
and of course,
um,
three bottles that can be filled with,
uh,

140
00:09:23.310 --> 00:09:27.950
with added calories.
Um,
we also know that we need,
uh,

141
00:09:27.960 --> 00:09:31.980
in race scenarios and training.
We also need to bring our flak gets storage.
Um,

142
00:09:31.981 --> 00:09:34.410
so we,
we designated a certain,
uh,
this is,

143
00:09:34.411 --> 00:09:37.740
this is what we decided that we need to fit on our bike for an ironman race.

144
00:09:40.640 --> 00:09:45.620
So,
um,
again,
after studying,
um,
users objectively,

145
00:09:46.190 --> 00:09:50.000
um,
after speaking to industry professionals and uh,

146
00:09:50.090 --> 00:09:52.440
and studying courses,
um,
we,

147
00:09:52.460 --> 00:09:57.460
we created a scope for the project and the scope is actually basically seven

148
00:09:58.011 --> 00:10:02.990
main priorities.
The first being we needed a modular and integrated design.

149
00:10:03.110 --> 00:10:06.710
Something that could fit all of those options that people,

150
00:10:06.780 --> 00:10:08.870
that people really with that wanting to ride with.

151
00:10:08.930 --> 00:10:12.700
But with the performance control that we,
that we wanted to gain a,

152
00:10:12.710 --> 00:10:17.560
we want to use round bottles.
Something that we realized was,
um,
uh,

153
00:10:17.840 --> 00:10:22.400
consistent across all the races across the world.
We want it to be easy to fit,

154
00:10:22.750 --> 00:10:23.180
um,

155
00:10:23.180 --> 00:10:26.270
just so that people can stay in their position and really actually stay true to

156
00:10:26.271 --> 00:10:30.410
our performance claims go faster for longer.

157
00:10:30.411 --> 00:10:34.070
We want it to be easy to adjust and we want it to be sorry.

158
00:10:34.071 --> 00:10:38.340
You want to be easy to adjust,
uh,
after fit.
So,
um,

159
00:10:39.260 --> 00:10:43.430
we want it to be easy to pack as well.
Um,
because of travel being a major,

160
00:10:43.520 --> 00:10:47.380
major proponent to the cycle.
And funny,

161
00:10:47.381 --> 00:10:48.680
like interestingly enough,

162
00:10:48.681 --> 00:10:53.681
our six priority was aerodynamics and our seventh was stiffness.

163
00:10:54.020 --> 00:10:57.080
Um,
so,
and that's where we started.

164
00:11:00.690 --> 00:11:05.160
<v 2>So then again,
the question is how do we start from there?</v>

165
00:11:05.540 --> 00:11:09.270
Um,
so if you look,
go to the next slide.
Does anybody know what these are?

166
00:11:11.750 --> 00:11:12.583
<v 0>Right?</v>

167
00:11:12.980 --> 00:11:14.340
<v 2>So,
so this is a,</v>

168
00:11:14.341 --> 00:11:19.341
a set of governing rules and boxes that are applied to UCI regulated bikes and

169
00:11:23.620 --> 00:11:24.080
um,

170
00:11:24.080 --> 00:11:28.280
that applies to any bike that's in the Tour de France or other races like that.

171
00:11:28.760 --> 00:11:33.760
And so every frame Max manufacturer has to fit their bike inside a set of boxes.

172
00:11:34.911 --> 00:11:35.960
You can move them around a bit,

173
00:11:35.961 --> 00:11:39.770
but they have to be of a certain dimension and it has to be a tube in every box.

174
00:11:40.550 --> 00:11:44.600
So if you look the next and the next slide,

175
00:11:45.230 --> 00:11:45.650
um,

176
00:11:45.650 --> 00:11:50.650
are p five is actually very driven in shape by these boxes.

177
00:11:51.110 --> 00:11:55.780
So you can see how closely it actually fits to those box shapes and really

178
00:11:56.320 --> 00:12:01.320
governs how we created that shape of that bike in triathlon.

179
00:12:01.840 --> 00:12:06.100
It's not governed by UCI regulations.
So we did not have that starting point.

180
00:12:06.790 --> 00:12:09.370
Um,
it's very challenging still to design,
uh,

181
00:12:09.650 --> 00:12:13.990
a fast and efficient and good bike within the UCI rules.

182
00:12:14.170 --> 00:12:16.450
But it does give you a place to start.
You know,

183
00:12:16.451 --> 00:12:18.910
there's going to be a tube in every one of those boxes.

184
00:12:19.390 --> 00:12:22.330
When we started this bike,
we didn't have that starting point.

185
00:12:22.360 --> 00:12:23.710
We had a blank piece of paper.

186
00:12:24.310 --> 00:12:27.370
And so in some ways that was almost more challenging.

187
00:12:27.580 --> 00:12:29.920
The freedom was really nice for as a designer.

188
00:12:30.370 --> 00:12:32.880
But the challenge is trying to figure out,
you know,

189
00:12:32.980 --> 00:12:36.250
which one of the ideas to go with.
So we needed some starting points,

190
00:12:36.251 --> 00:12:39.100
some sources of inspiration to come up with how to,

191
00:12:39.520 --> 00:12:42.070
how to make the shape of the bike.
Um,

192
00:12:42.100 --> 00:12:47.100
so one place that we started is a structural analysis and we used a tool called

193
00:12:47.501 --> 00:12:48.970
topology optimization.

194
00:12:49.870 --> 00:12:54.870
And what that is is it's a computer software algorithm that gives you a sense of

195
00:12:56.501 --> 00:13:00.040
where material is really important in a structural volume.

196
00:13:00.820 --> 00:13:03.160
So what we did is we created,
just go back one,

197
00:13:04.150 --> 00:13:07.660
we created this volume of space that's shown there,

198
00:13:07.830 --> 00:13:12.830
a semi transparent and that represents the part of the frame that that's part of

199
00:13:13.781 --> 00:13:17.800
the space that we can use for frame material that doesn't interfere with all the

200
00:13:17.801 --> 00:13:20.080
wheels,
the cranks,
the riders' legs.

201
00:13:21.070 --> 00:13:26.070
And then to that shape we apply loads that represent riding loads in real life.

202
00:13:26.650 --> 00:13:29.980
So you know,
the twisting of the frame,
um,
due to writing.

203
00:13:30.880 --> 00:13:35.880
And then what the software does is it actually takes away material that isn't a

204
00:13:36.160 --> 00:13:40.750
highly loaded or highly stressed and it actually removes that material and then

205
00:13:40.751 --> 00:13:45.040
reruns the simulation again and it keeps eating away at material until you're

206
00:13:45.041 --> 00:13:49.300
left with just the most essential material to meet that load case.

207
00:13:49.600 --> 00:13:52.090
So you can see in this little animation here,

208
00:13:52.300 --> 00:13:57.160
you start with a big block shown in blue and actually sort of erodes away at the

209
00:13:57.161 --> 00:14:02.161
material and you're just left with the key bits of material that are most

210
00:14:02.231 --> 00:14:02.890
important.

211
00:14:02.890 --> 00:14:06.190
And so that gives us a sense of maybe where we should have material on the bike.

212
00:14:06.700 --> 00:14:10.420
So you see a very strong connection between the head tube at the front of the

213
00:14:10.421 --> 00:14:12.580
bike down to where the cranks are,

214
00:14:13.030 --> 00:14:18.030
and then a very low rear end to the back wheel and then kind of this diagonal

215
00:14:18.220 --> 00:14:22.880
member off to the seat.
So the,
the question was,
um,

216
00:14:22.900 --> 00:14:27.790
how do we address the directionality of using carbon,
um,
versus,

217
00:14:27.791 --> 00:14:32.050
uh,
a material like aluminum,
which is continuous in all directions.

218
00:14:32.530 --> 00:14:36.160
Um,
so in this case we're doing,
uh,

219
00:14:36.670 --> 00:14:39.320
what we found is it's too complicated,

220
00:14:39.460 --> 00:14:42.910
complicated to try and apply that at the initial stages.

221
00:14:43.090 --> 00:14:48.070
So what we do is we do a sort of a simple aluminum light case and that tells us

222
00:14:48.071 --> 00:14:50.950
where the material is important.
Um,

223
00:14:51.080 --> 00:14:55.860
but we still later have to go and optimize our layup and figure out,
um,

224
00:14:55.910 --> 00:14:59.210
how we apply the carbon to that.
Um,
so really again,

225
00:14:59.211 --> 00:15:00.620
it's just a source of inspiration.

226
00:15:00.621 --> 00:15:03.230
Like generally what are we looking for in the frame?

227
00:15:05.250 --> 00:15:05.620
<v 0>Okay.</v>

228
00:15:05.620 --> 00:15:05.881
<v 2>Um,</v>

229
00:15:05.881 --> 00:15:09.760
and the next slide you can also see another version of the output where you can

230
00:15:09.761 --> 00:15:13.450
actually force it to provide you with a trust structure and see what that would

231
00:15:13.451 --> 00:15:15.760
look like.
And you can kind of see the,

232
00:15:16.240 --> 00:15:21.040
the essence of maybe a loud motorcycle frame there in that version.

233
00:15:22.570 --> 00:15:26.050
So then how do we turn these into actual designs?

234
00:15:26.230 --> 00:15:30.670
So in the next slide you can see a number of the different directions we were

235
00:15:30.671 --> 00:15:32.620
going with the concept.
Uh,

236
00:15:32.710 --> 00:15:37.330
in the top left we have a frame that's sort of a literal translation of that,

237
00:15:37.750 --> 00:15:41.620
um,
topology optimization,
uh,
turned into a frame.

238
00:15:42.490 --> 00:15:44.260
Um,
but then at the same time,

239
00:15:44.261 --> 00:15:48.850
we're also looking at parallel development streams where we're saying,
okay,

240
00:15:48.851 --> 00:15:52.030
well what if we just want the most aero bike?
Um,

241
00:15:52.120 --> 00:15:55.960
we see frames there where we're taking a p five and just adding surfaces to make

242
00:15:55.961 --> 00:15:57.460
it more arrow.
Um,

243
00:15:57.461 --> 00:16:01.720
we're seeing other ones there where we're looking at a usability of the bottles.

244
00:16:01.721 --> 00:16:05.740
Can we drop them in just like a cup holder in a car?
Um,

245
00:16:05.770 --> 00:16:09.550
we are even looking at compliance and whether that's a good thing or a bad
thing.

246
00:16:12.210 --> 00:16:14.880
So what we found though is there was a,

247
00:16:14.881 --> 00:16:19.050
we kept running into this issue of where to put the round bottle on the frame

248
00:16:19.350 --> 00:16:22.980
and it actually became more driving to the design than we expected.

249
00:16:24.310 --> 00:16:28.830
Um,
we have this bottle that we wanted to incorporate into the frame,

250
00:16:29.400 --> 00:16:30.000
um,

251
00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:35.000
but we realized that we needed material around it and we couldn't interfere with

252
00:16:36.871 --> 00:16:39.840
the riders' legs.
So we,
in the end we,

253
00:16:39.900 --> 00:16:44.400
we sort of had three different approaches to that problem.
Um,
the first being,

254
00:16:45.110 --> 00:16:48.870
uh,
the material below and behind the bottle like this.

255
00:16:49.470 --> 00:16:53.310
And then the second sort of going around the bottle on either side and then the

256
00:16:53.311 --> 00:16:57.150
third being in front and above the bottle,
which is what you see in front of you.

257
00:16:57.960 --> 00:17:01.410
Um,
there was a lot of potential in some of the first ones,

258
00:17:01.411 --> 00:17:05.820
but there we were getting structural challenges with having enough stiffness in

259
00:17:05.821 --> 00:17:09.000
those systems.
So,
um,

260
00:17:09.360 --> 00:17:12.240
in the end we went with this approach,
um,

261
00:17:12.330 --> 00:17:16.170
as it gives a good connection from the seat post into the head tube,

262
00:17:16.640 --> 00:17:18.990
a good connection from the head tube to the down tube,

263
00:17:19.560 --> 00:17:24.560
but also has this nice volume in here that we can use for a bottle or additional

264
00:17:25.261 --> 00:17:26.970
storage with a horizontal bottle.

265
00:17:28.500 --> 00:17:33.150
So through this process we want it to just highlight a few neat,
um,

266
00:17:33.360 --> 00:17:34.500
tests that we had to do.

267
00:17:34.770 --> 00:17:39.770
Quite often we'd have a concern or an idea that came up and we'd need to quickly

268
00:17:41.881 --> 00:17:46.260
test it,
um,
and not just speculate on what,
how it might work.

269
00:17:46.890 --> 00:17:51.480
Um,
so there's a few cases here.
The one shows we're testing two things here.

270
00:17:52.110 --> 00:17:55.680
Um,
you may know the sort of ideo approach,

271
00:17:55.681 --> 00:18:00.630
which is a rough,
ripe,
right and rapid for prototyping.

272
00:18:01.140 --> 00:18:05.190
And this is kind of an example of that.
It's very rough,

273
00:18:05.430 --> 00:18:10.430
but it gives us a good test and we did it very quickly and got a good answer

274
00:18:11.491 --> 00:18:11.791
from it.

275
00:18:11.791 --> 00:18:16.080
So we're filling in the entire frame because we wanted to test the effect of

276
00:18:16.081 --> 00:18:16.914
side area.

277
00:18:17.100 --> 00:18:21.240
We knew that we were looking at designs that had more side surface area to them.

278
00:18:21.690 --> 00:18:23.670
So we did a number of ride tests with that.

279
00:18:23.980 --> 00:18:28.680
And at the same time we've also got a bottle cut in half and taped to the side

280
00:18:28.681 --> 00:18:29.310
of that.

281
00:18:29.310 --> 00:18:33.870
And that allows us to move that bottle around in space and find out the highest

282
00:18:33.871 --> 00:18:36.660
we can mount a bottle without interfering with the riders' legs.

283
00:18:36.840 --> 00:18:38.460
So we'd had a number of writers try that.

284
00:18:38.790 --> 00:18:42.600
We created this volume for each rider and now we know where we can put the

285
00:18:42.601 --> 00:18:46.740
bottle.
Uh,
this is a test we did where we instrumented,

286
00:18:47.100 --> 00:18:51.840
um,
an athlete's bike.
And so we had power,

287
00:18:52.030 --> 00:18:55.260
a Yang or speed gps,

288
00:18:55.740 --> 00:18:57.450
but we also had this video on board.

289
00:18:57.900 --> 00:19:02.250
And one interesting thing we were able to look at was we could scrub through the

290
00:19:02.251 --> 00:19:06.360
video and find out how often he was in the extension position.

291
00:19:06.390 --> 00:19:11.310
I want to how often he was in the base part position.
Um,
and as we know,

292
00:19:12.210 --> 00:19:15.450
being in the extensions is much more Arrow and you save a lot of energy being

293
00:19:15.451 --> 00:19:16.870
there.
Um,

294
00:19:16.950 --> 00:19:21.630
so it was an interesting exercise in perception because he thought he was sure

295
00:19:21.631 --> 00:19:23.490
he was in at 95% of the time,

296
00:19:23.700 --> 00:19:26.910
but when we went to the video it was a lot closer to 60%.

297
00:19:27.420 --> 00:19:32.420
And so we realized that we needed to find out why he was doing that and also the

298
00:19:33.361 --> 00:19:36.510
importance of creating comfort in that position so he could stay there.

299
00:19:39.580 --> 00:19:42.970
<v 3>We also did some testing for storage,</v>

300
00:19:44.020 --> 00:19:48.520
ease of use in terms of the position and keep in mind we didn't have an actual

301
00:19:48.950 --> 00:19:52.190
frame is uh,
is,
was so unique that we,
we were,

302
00:19:52.410 --> 00:19:57.310
we were having to work on all of these tests with a fives.
We had cut up our,

303
00:19:58.120 --> 00:20:00.060
our,
our old Pete fives and uh,

304
00:20:00.330 --> 00:20:05.200
and tried to place them in the most accurate position to the new bike or to our

305
00:20:05.201 --> 00:20:08.380
concept at that point where that,
where the storage would be in that,

306
00:20:08.381 --> 00:20:12.970
in that concept.
So you can see we,
we,
we would cut the top tube right off,

307
00:20:13.000 --> 00:20:16.660
lower it down to the place where you'd see now on,
on the,
on the bike room.

308
00:20:17.170 --> 00:20:21.550
And then we'd have people test out the ease of use in terms of,

309
00:20:22.500 --> 00:20:26.690
at that point we had an idea where we would put storage inside of the frame and

310
00:20:26.840 --> 00:20:29.830
we wanted to make sure that people could access it and that justified things

311
00:20:29.831 --> 00:20:32.590
like,
which we'll talk about later in terms of the features,

312
00:20:32.591 --> 00:20:36.820
but making sure that the top section was relatively pliable so that someone

313
00:20:36.821 --> 00:20:37.780
could get their handed.

314
00:20:39.420 --> 00:20:44.420
We also tested the idea of putting the volume down near the BBI,

315
00:20:44.860 --> 00:20:49.030
under the,
under the down.
Um,
and we wanted to make sure that,
that,

316
00:20:49.031 --> 00:20:51.820
how that we knew how that would affect the ride experience,

317
00:20:51.850 --> 00:20:56.780
if it would affect it at all.
And also,
um,
design,
um,

318
00:20:57.490 --> 00:20:59.420
I guess design ideas.
I was too,
you know,

319
00:20:59.470 --> 00:21:04.470
what side the doors should go on or will it make any noise or things like that.

320
00:21:04.720 --> 00:21:05.553
<v 0>So,</v>

321
00:21:06.540 --> 00:21:11.460
<v 3>and of course we did a,
we did some when we did get our first,</v>

322
00:21:11.510 --> 00:21:16.050
uh,
frames together.
We did some initial product testing with,
uh,

323
00:21:16.530 --> 00:21:19.620
with some of our pro athletes.
That's,
this is Sarah,
that Sarah,

324
00:21:21.240 --> 00:21:24.270
um,
and she,
she's a,
she,

325
00:21:24.870 --> 00:21:28.970
she's kind of smiling in that picture that she's come pretty fast.
So we,
we've,

326
00:21:28.971 --> 00:21:32.340
we've got some really good feedback from our pros at this stage as well.

327
00:21:32.430 --> 00:21:37.260
I'm just making that final tweak,
validating,
um,
that we're ready for her,
uh,

328
00:21:37.320 --> 00:21:38.153
for production.

329
00:21:38.660 --> 00:21:39.140
<v 0>Okay.</v>

330
00:21:39.140 --> 00:21:41.150
<v 2>Yeah,
right,
right from the beginning,
you know,</v>

331
00:21:41.151 --> 00:21:45.110
Sarah was there and our first engineer hears and then right at the end,
you know,

332
00:21:45.200 --> 00:21:48.500
down to the last,
the last development cycle.
We know she has,

333
00:21:48.510 --> 00:21:53.210
they're giving great feedback.
Um,
so we'll take you through,

334
00:21:53.540 --> 00:21:56.420
uh,
the features of the bike.
Um,

335
00:21:57.020 --> 00:22:00.710
and I wanted to start with the bottles because that was again,
as I said,

336
00:22:00.711 --> 00:22:05.660
a big driving factor.
So what we ended up providing,
um,
again,

337
00:22:05.750 --> 00:22:07.090
round bottles,
um,

338
00:22:07.210 --> 00:22:11.630
so that it's very easy to grab and throw away bottles during the race.
Um,

339
00:22:11.710 --> 00:22:15.590
you're not committed to a fully integrated Arrow bottle that you don't want to

340
00:22:15.591 --> 00:22:19.610
lose.
So we got a round bottle between the arms.
Just really nice.

341
00:22:19.740 --> 00:22:24.440
Can Be Very Arrow and sort of reminds you to drink as well.
Um,

342
00:22:24.441 --> 00:22:29.030
we have a bottle here positioned horizontally,
um,

343
00:22:29.540 --> 00:22:33.650
and which is nice for access but also gives this option for additional storage

344
00:22:33.651 --> 00:22:38.240
box.
If you don't want that box or you want a more traditional a bottle angle,

345
00:22:38.241 --> 00:22:40.010
you can mount it like this on the down tube.

346
00:22:41.710 --> 00:22:46.020
Then at the back we created a,
a single bottle rear mount,
um,

347
00:22:46.110 --> 00:22:49.810
which has a very aerodynamic position.
And um,

348
00:22:50.020 --> 00:22:52.210
we also provided,
uh,

349
00:22:52.240 --> 00:22:57.070
like it's fully integrated and built into the seat post,
so it's very stiff.
Uh,

350
00:22:57.100 --> 00:23:00.910
it also articulates and slides in and out so that you can get the bottle at the

351
00:23:00.911 --> 00:23:02.830
angle and the distance that you like.

352
00:23:07.180 --> 00:23:12.080
<v 3>Yeah.
In terms of top two stories,
so,
um,
where we designed was a,</v>

353
00:23:12.100 --> 00:23:15.610
a two part,
a top deep storage system,
which we call the smart pack.

354
00:23:16.370 --> 00:23:19.970
It's got an upper section,
which is um,
a rubber material.

355
00:23:20.020 --> 00:23:24.830
It's a semi rigid to hold the form I,
while not in use,
um,
of the bike.

356
00:23:24.831 --> 00:23:26.930
But while in use,
you're able to,
uh,

357
00:23:26.960 --> 00:23:30.830
pry it apart and reached down into the second section located inside of the

358
00:23:30.831 --> 00:23:32.340
frame.
Um,

359
00:23:32.360 --> 00:23:37.360
it also has a designated a pill tray located in the rear and kind of see it in

360
00:23:37.971 --> 00:23:41.780
the picture and some side pockets.
Um,
just for,
again,

361
00:23:41.781 --> 00:23:45.530
just to give people options.
A lot of people are pretty unique.
Their,

362
00:23:45.560 --> 00:23:50.360
with their nutrition needs.
Some people make their own even,
um,
and they,

363
00:23:50.420 --> 00:23:52.130
and they pack it certain way.
So we,
again,

364
00:23:52.131 --> 00:23:54.830
we just provided these optional things that you could add in or take out.

365
00:23:55.220 --> 00:23:57.980
You could also even run the whole thing with.
Um,

366
00:23:58.550 --> 00:24:01.010
there's actually a door that blocks off the internal compartments.

367
00:24:01.011 --> 00:24:02.570
So if you were,

368
00:24:02.990 --> 00:24:07.490
if somebody that didn't require as much nutrition,
they could,
they could do that.

369
00:24:07.670 --> 00:24:11.310
And it's alternatively,
they could also remove the upper section,
um,

370
00:24:11.530 --> 00:24:15.500
and just run the,
uh,
the in-frame compartment.
Okay.

371
00:24:16.400 --> 00:24:19.880
So the in-frame storage,
um,
actually I can just talk to them.

372
00:24:20.720 --> 00:24:23.870
We call that the stealth box and that's essentially where we've designated the

373
00:24:23.871 --> 00:24:28.590
area for,
um,
for our flag kit.
It's got an optional,
uh,

374
00:24:28.591 --> 00:24:32.420
internal case,
uh,
which,
which you can fill with,

375
00:24:32.470 --> 00:24:35.870
with all of the items that we determined in our research.
Um,

376
00:24:36.230 --> 00:24:41.230
and then you can also remove that back at back piece and just run the door alone

377
00:24:42.140 --> 00:24:45.770
and,
and essentially pack more items inside of the frame.

378
00:24:45.800 --> 00:24:47.090
Things like tubulars in the,

379
00:24:47.091 --> 00:24:51.060
in the case where people would be writing tubulars are they want to bring,
um,

380
00:24:51.420 --> 00:24:56.150
a large pump or something.
They can,
they can put it inside the frame and uh,

381
00:24:56.750 --> 00:25:01.370
and uh,
and still have enough space sandwiches,
subway sandwiches sometimes.

382
00:25:02.060 --> 00:25:06.620
Um,
and in those cases where you might need that storage for your whole sandwich,

383
00:25:06.621 --> 00:25:11.300
you could put the,
your,
the rest of your flag kit inside of the speed case,

384
00:25:11.540 --> 00:25:14.660
which is an optional a case as David described.

385
00:25:15.290 --> 00:25:17.900
And that's just a same whoop.
That's not good.

386
00:25:19.240 --> 00:25:24.240
The same a side door loaded a plastic case.

387
00:25:25.880 --> 00:25:29.660
Um,
yeah.
And so,

388
00:25:31.670 --> 00:25:33.440
yeah,
so these are,

389
00:25:33.470 --> 00:25:37.670
these are the storage areas which we've essentially,
um,

390
00:25:37.790 --> 00:25:42.040
decided on based on that research and our user testing.
Um,

391
00:25:43.160 --> 00:25:47.350
essentially trying to provide as many options as possible while controlling our,

392
00:25:47.351 --> 00:25:50.600
uh,
our performance and our aesthetic.

393
00:25:53.070 --> 00:25:57.210
<v 2>Um,
so a question that often comes up now that people have seen the bike as,</v>

394
00:25:57.211 --> 00:26:01.980
why are we using disc brakes?
A big part of that we really,

395
00:26:02.020 --> 00:26:06.090
you know,
there are road line is going towards disc.
Um,

396
00:26:06.540 --> 00:26:11.380
we really want to bring that,
that control,
that power and um,

397
00:26:11.520 --> 00:26:16.230
consistency in all weather conditions that you get from disk breaks into the

398
00:26:16.231 --> 00:26:18.630
triathlon market.
Um,
so there was,

399
00:26:18.700 --> 00:26:22.860
there was no question there for us that we wanted to do that at the same time.

400
00:26:23.420 --> 00:26:23.940
Um,

401
00:26:23.940 --> 00:26:28.050
what's really neat is it opens up new design opportunities for the bike itself.

402
00:26:28.400 --> 00:26:28.980
Um,

403
00:26:28.980 --> 00:26:33.570
the system is now changing a bit and so we can change how we design it.

404
00:26:33.900 --> 00:26:36.510
So,
uh,
because we don't have a,

405
00:26:36.630 --> 00:26:40.290
a room break up at the top of the fork,
um,

406
00:26:40.440 --> 00:26:44.730
this area is now much freer in terms of design.
So we can clean that up.
Derek,

407
00:26:44.760 --> 00:26:46.590
aerodynamically.
Um,

408
00:26:46.591 --> 00:26:50.640
we can also create a much stiffer front end because there isn't a break inside.

409
00:26:50.641 --> 00:26:52.200
They're using up space.

410
00:26:52.830 --> 00:26:57.270
And it also helped us achieve our adjustable front end that I'll show in a bit.

411
00:26:59.160 --> 00:27:04.050
Um,
we're also,
uh,
the,
the frame is designed,
um,

412
00:27:04.110 --> 00:27:06.480
or optimized for electronic shifting,

413
00:27:06.990 --> 00:27:10.830
which is sort of the way that the components are going these days.
Um,

414
00:27:10.831 --> 00:27:14.880
it's still works with mechanical shifting as well.
Um,
but what we wanted to do,

415
00:27:15.150 --> 00:27:18.810
um,
a number of the electronic systems,
uh,

416
00:27:18.811 --> 00:27:22.440
the wiring comes into a junction box.
Um,

417
00:27:22.470 --> 00:27:26.910
and so one element that we wanted to conceal that,
um,

418
00:27:26.940 --> 00:27:30.270
but you know,
there's still,
uh,
a rubber,

419
00:27:30.630 --> 00:27:35.260
a window at the top and then you can see the battery of life,
uh,
for that box.
Um,

420
00:27:35.270 --> 00:27:39.970
and then you can also access it by unclipping the back.
Um,

421
00:27:40.050 --> 00:27:42.120
and then you can charge it that way as well.

422
00:27:42.420 --> 00:27:46.710
So we wanted to sort of conceal that element but keep it very user friendly at

423
00:27:46.711 --> 00:27:51.420
the same time.
Um,
so now the front end of the bike,
um,

424
00:27:51.510 --> 00:27:55.050
which is probably my favorite part of the system.
Um,

425
00:27:55.410 --> 00:27:59.610
we really wanted to prioritize the adjustments that we wanted people to be able

426
00:27:59.611 --> 00:28:02.160
to make and make after that.

427
00:28:02.161 --> 00:28:04.620
First fitting so they could change their fit throughout the,

428
00:28:04.830 --> 00:28:09.600
throughout the season as they got more flexible or got back into that position.

429
00:28:10.200 --> 00:28:11.033
Um,

430
00:28:11.850 --> 00:28:16.560
so our first priority was the vertical adjustment of the front end.

431
00:28:16.561 --> 00:28:19.890
So how high or low your arms are.
Um,

432
00:28:20.010 --> 00:28:22.980
and we wanted that to be very easy to make.
So we said,
what,

433
00:28:23.010 --> 00:28:27.360
where else on the frame do we have a really easy vertical adjustment?
Well,

434
00:28:27.720 --> 00:28:32.220
sorry,
the,
uh,
the seat post,
um,
the seat post.

435
00:28:32.550 --> 00:28:35.190
So we have a wedge clamp,
um,

436
00:28:35.310 --> 00:28:38.190
which you adjust with a formula Allen key and it slides up and down.

437
00:28:38.550 --> 00:28:43.060
So we essentially took that same concept and applied it to the front.
Um,

438
00:28:43.140 --> 00:28:47.440
so we have,
uh,
you access it through a hole in the front.

439
00:28:47.460 --> 00:28:51.510
There's a formula Allen key that you would grab you and be the wedge clan and

440
00:28:51.511 --> 00:28:56.070
then you can adjust that up and down,
um,
very easily.
Um,

441
00:28:56.640 --> 00:29:00.360
for those that haven't had a tri bike in your life before,

442
00:29:01.140 --> 00:29:03.720
that's a very unique thing to have that kind of adjustment.

443
00:29:04.170 --> 00:29:08.040
Very often you sort of committed,
once you pick here,
you're fit to,

444
00:29:08.100 --> 00:29:11.460
that's where you're going to be.
Um,
so in the video here,

445
00:29:11.461 --> 00:29:16.380
you can see that that vertical adjustment,
um,
as the first priority.

446
00:29:16.680 --> 00:29:21.480
And then there's also,
you know,
for craft any note adjustment of the pads.

447
00:29:21.481 --> 00:29:26.100
So you can see it flipping there to get a very large range of pad adjustment.

448
00:29:26.760 --> 00:29:31.760
There's width of the pad that you picked by bolting in a different increment.

449
00:29:32.970 --> 00:29:37.770
Then the extensions,
um,
are,
are just a clamped cylinders.

450
00:29:37.771 --> 00:29:40.620
So they're very easy to pull in and out and trim to the length you want.

451
00:29:41.590 --> 00:29:44.320
And then the base bar down here,
actually,

452
00:29:44.321 --> 00:29:48.070
it can be flipped up or down and you can see on this frame is flipped up.

453
00:29:48.340 --> 00:29:52.870
And this one it's flipped down and gives you a choice at the time of cabling the

454
00:29:52.871 --> 00:29:53.320
bike,

455
00:29:53.320 --> 00:29:57.940
whether you want a high or low based bar tilt adjust as well.

456
00:29:58.150 --> 00:30:01.240
Yeah,
we didn't,
we didn't mention that in there,
but,
uh,

457
00:30:01.480 --> 00:30:06.070
on the [inaudible] we weren't able to pitch up and down because a UCI rules say

458
00:30:06.071 --> 00:30:09.820
that you have to have horizontal arms.
So,
um,

459
00:30:10.120 --> 00:30:14.320
but it's quite a nice feature to be able to just tweak that a little bit and

460
00:30:14.321 --> 00:30:15.640
sort of lean into the front end.

461
00:30:16.060 --> 00:30:20.590
So there's two bolts in the top and you can just dial in that,
uh,

462
00:30:20.770 --> 00:30:25.690
that pitch of the front end as you like it.
So,

463
00:30:25.990 --> 00:30:26.351
um,

464
00:30:26.351 --> 00:30:29.740
another feature that you may have noticed if you looked at the bikes is the bars

465
00:30:29.741 --> 00:30:33.610
are actually split and they're made in two halves.
They're not just flippable,

466
00:30:33.611 --> 00:30:35.020
but they're actually two halves.

467
00:30:35.500 --> 00:30:39.750
And that allows for some neat things when you get to,
um,

468
00:30:39.910 --> 00:30:42.820
traveling with the bike.
And so we'll show that here.

469
00:30:42.850 --> 00:30:46.050
We really wanted to create a complete system,
um,

470
00:30:46.180 --> 00:30:50.230
to help reduce that stress of,
of getting your bike to the race,

471
00:30:51.660 --> 00:30:53.670
<v 3>right?
So you can see that we did that actually,</v>

472
00:30:54.390 --> 00:30:58.950
the idea of creating a bike that was optimized for travel was,

473
00:30:59.080 --> 00:31:01.250
was essentially,
um,
you know,

474
00:31:01.260 --> 00:31:04.830
dumped from the beginning and our scope and obviously shown in the collapsible

475
00:31:04.831 --> 00:31:06.210
bars.
Why else would we do that?

476
00:31:06.660 --> 00:31:11.660
And a show show you and this likened helium four bike bag,

477
00:31:14.070 --> 00:31:18.750
oops,
sorry.
Um,
we were able to collapse the bars off to the side,

478
00:31:19.140 --> 00:31:22.230
um,
by removing four bolts and a and a plate.

479
00:31:23.040 --> 00:31:26.700
And actually with the same ease of adjustability of the whole front end,

480
00:31:26.701 --> 00:31:31.540
you're able to release it just like a seat post,
remove it,
um,

481
00:31:31.780 --> 00:31:36.710
packet in front of the bike and it's all strapped into place with um,

482
00:31:36.900 --> 00:31:38.400
some custom neoprene.

483
00:31:38.401 --> 00:31:43.401
Formal did a protective padding that we developed a alongside of a Canadian bike

484
00:31:45.601 --> 00:31:49.520
render,
biking,
uh,
to create that full,
um,

485
00:31:49.680 --> 00:31:53.700
triathlon travel hacking solution.
So

486
00:31:55.380 --> 00:31:57.450
directly related is a adjustability,

487
00:31:57.510 --> 00:31:59.310
the ease of adjustability and the ease for travel.

488
00:32:00.130 --> 00:32:03.360
It's only six bolts that you need to,
um,

489
00:32:03.480 --> 00:32:08.480
to access in order to pack the whole bike and one bolt for the rear derailleur.

490
00:32:09.620 --> 00:32:14.020
But in terms of the bike and direction,
it's one tool,
four millimeter tool,
um,

491
00:32:14.200 --> 00:32:17.460
can be done in a few minutes.
I don't know.
I don't know if there's anyone here.

492
00:32:18.320 --> 00:32:21.230
Um,
does anyone have any horror stories for packing their bike?

493
00:32:22.820 --> 00:32:25.800
A couple of people.
So a lot of times,
again,

494
00:32:25.920 --> 00:32:29.660
a jug adjustability and packing go hand in hand.
Um,
when,

495
00:32:29.730 --> 00:32:33.330
when the bike is not very easily adjustable,
it's likely not very easy to pack.

496
00:32:34.060 --> 00:32:37.390
Um,
another couple of features of this bike bag is,
um,

497
00:32:37.670 --> 00:32:42.110
he uses a airbag protection on either side,

498
00:32:42.770 --> 00:32:45.110
which allows you to,
I guess,

499
00:32:45.860 --> 00:32:48.890
provide that secure that's secure,

500
00:32:48.891 --> 00:32:53.060
fit for all of the parts and also allows you to pack two sets of wheels and

501
00:32:53.061 --> 00:32:57.380
still maintain underweight.
Right.
Do we make it through underweight?
Yeah.
Awesome.

502
00:32:57.470 --> 00:33:01.910
So this is,
this is actually a was bite.
This is a world champion bike.

503
00:33:03.400 --> 00:33:04.340
Still got the tag on it.

504
00:33:08.090 --> 00:33:11.250
It's still got the sweat on it and everything.

505
00:33:12.080 --> 00:33:16.420
Really trying to I guess
support the,
uh,

506
00:33:16.421 --> 00:33:17.540
the full triathlon experience.

507
00:33:17.541 --> 00:33:21.650
And this is sort of the icing on the cake with all of the other features that

508
00:33:21.651 --> 00:33:26.620
we've,
that we've tried to bring into the bike.
This is sort of that,
um,

509
00:33:26.930 --> 00:33:31.510
that,
that last check.
Um,
so providing a solution for,

510
00:33:31.530 --> 00:33:35.660
for travel,
the full travel experience to,
to bike wheels,
full bike,

511
00:33:36.250 --> 00:33:41.210
um,
all,
uh,
altogether and,
and,
and no loose parts.

512
00:33:41.330 --> 00:33:44.640
Um,
so just reducing that,
that stressor in the,
uh,

513
00:33:44.960 --> 00:33:46.460
in the triathlon racing experience.

514
00:33:47.950 --> 00:33:52.570
<v 2>And that's it.
Um,
so manufacturing,
uh,</v>

515
00:33:52.610 --> 00:33:53.830
we're just going to touch on quickly,

516
00:33:53.831 --> 00:33:56.870
but it's actually pretty key part of this project.
Um,

517
00:33:56.890 --> 00:34:01.510
we knew that with a design like this,
we really had to,
um,

518
00:34:02.050 --> 00:34:05.920
work with very strong partners,
people we could collaborate with.
Um,

519
00:34:05.921 --> 00:34:10.921
we also knew that there was a concern with Ip for the bike because it was such a

520
00:34:11.021 --> 00:34:15.080
unique shape.
We didn't want it getting out before launch.
Um,

521
00:34:15.370 --> 00:34:20.370
so we wanted a factory where we were more exclusive and uh,

522
00:34:20.800 --> 00:34:23.060
had really strong partners.
So we,
we part,

523
00:34:23.061 --> 00:34:27.160
we're partnered with two of the industry leaders,
um,

524
00:34:27.550 --> 00:34:30.980
in,
in manufacturing,
in um,

525
00:34:31.390 --> 00:34:36.370
front end design as well and wheels.
Um,
so the frame is made with head,

526
00:34:36.790 --> 00:34:37.420
um,

527
00:34:37.420 --> 00:34:42.420
in Minnesota and the front end from the head tube forward is made by envy in

528
00:34:44.081 --> 00:34:45.850
Utah.
And,
uh,

529
00:34:47.470 --> 00:34:51.880
it's just been a great partnership and having their expertise,

530
00:34:52.000 --> 00:34:56.440
um,
to add,
uh,
has really made the project happen the way it has.

531
00:34:58.300 --> 00:35:02.230
Um,
and then we'll get into the numbers because we always liked numbers.

532
00:35:02.890 --> 00:35:07.630
Um,
so in the end in terms of the frame stiffness,

533
00:35:08.020 --> 00:35:11.050
uh,
we've actually improved the head tube stiffness,

534
00:35:11.051 --> 00:35:15.040
which is the front end stiffness of the frame.
Um,

535
00:35:15.400 --> 00:35:20.320
and uh,
the BB stiffness is the same as a p five.

536
00:35:20.780 --> 00:35:24.400
Um,
and we found that those are,
those are very positively received.

537
00:35:24.730 --> 00:35:29.560
A big part of that is the frame has made an all one piece,
one continuous piece,

538
00:35:29.561 --> 00:35:34.560
no bond joints,
uh,
in the middle of tubes.
Um,
so that's really helped us create a,

539
00:35:34.610 --> 00:35:39.250
a very strong system.
The other thing we wanted to know does that,
uh,

540
00:35:39.300 --> 00:35:44.070
this is not designed to be a suspension,
a beam kind of ride.

541
00:35:44.100 --> 00:35:48.210
This is a,
this is a stiff frame.
Um,

542
00:35:48.570 --> 00:35:52.950
and the deflections are very small at the,
at the beam.
So,

543
00:35:53.400 --> 00:35:57.720
um,
it's not like some of the older beam bikes you may have seen in the past.

544
00:35:58.230 --> 00:35:58.590
Um,

545
00:35:58.590 --> 00:36:02.940
and that combined with through axles at the front and this very stiff front end,

546
00:36:03.230 --> 00:36:05.190
um,
it's really positive on the road.

547
00:36:06.610 --> 00:36:07.070
<v 0>Okay.</v>

548
00:36:07.070 --> 00:36:10.850
<v 2>Uh,
and then to get into the air dynamics a bit.
Um,</v>

549
00:36:11.090 --> 00:36:12.290
if you don't know already,

550
00:36:12.440 --> 00:36:17.420
we try and test with a balanced between very consistent wind tunnel,

551
00:36:17.630 --> 00:36:20.840
uh,
procedure and representing real life.

552
00:36:21.110 --> 00:36:24.890
So we find if we test with live writers,
the data is very noisy.

553
00:36:25.040 --> 00:36:29.010
So we use what you see here,
which is a mannequin,
uh,

554
00:36:29.120 --> 00:36:33.650
in position as a mannequin of Dave's a brisky.
And,
uh,

555
00:36:33.740 --> 00:36:36.110
that's how we compare.
In this case,

556
00:36:36.200 --> 00:36:39.380
we want to compare the bike as it's used in real life,

557
00:36:39.381 --> 00:36:42.590
which is in triathlons with stuff on it.

558
00:36:43.070 --> 00:36:47.160
So our test,
um,
that we're presenting,
uh,

559
00:36:47.210 --> 00:36:51.050
primarily for this pike is fully loaded.
So we have three bottles.

560
00:36:51.290 --> 00:36:55.430
We have all the food on it and the tools as well.
Um,

561
00:36:55.490 --> 00:36:56.480
on the p five,

562
00:36:56.780 --> 00:37:00.650
we had to tape on some items to get that full capacity,

563
00:37:00.651 --> 00:37:03.800
whereas on the p five x were able to contain everything in the frame.

564
00:37:04.770 --> 00:37:09.350
So the result is that,
um,
we met our goal,
we're faster than the p five.

565
00:37:09.830 --> 00:37:12.170
Um,
and,
uh,

566
00:37:12.500 --> 00:37:15.890
on average 30 grams faster,
um,

567
00:37:16.370 --> 00:37:18.860
across the 15 degree Django sweep,

568
00:37:18.861 --> 00:37:23.810
which is the range of a wind angles to the bike depending on what kind of

569
00:37:23.811 --> 00:37:24.950
crosswind you're riding it.

570
00:37:27.320 --> 00:37:27.680
<v 0>Okay.</v>

571
00:37:27.680 --> 00:37:32.180
<v 2>Um,
so now,
um,
video.
Okay.
Well I'll take you through,</v>

572
00:37:32.390 --> 00:37:34.910
um,
really for,
as you've seen,

573
00:37:34.911 --> 00:37:37.970
this is a focus on personalizing your bike,

574
00:37:37.971 --> 00:37:41.450
making it for the rider and um,
it's,

575
00:37:41.490 --> 00:37:43.400
it's about the experience with the bike,

576
00:37:43.430 --> 00:37:46.580
not the bike on his own and you'll kind of see that in the video as well.

577
00:39:31.860 --> 00:39:32.693
<v 0>Okay.</v>

578
00:39:40.590 --> 00:39:43.470
<v 2>All right.
Um,
so today that's our presentation,</v>

579
00:39:43.471 --> 00:39:47.370
but we've gotten a bit of time for questions I think with the disc brakes.

580
00:39:47.400 --> 00:39:52.400
Can you use a dis squeal or do you you sacrifice that by yes,

581
00:39:53.720 --> 00:39:58.170
there they are starting to make desk wheels with test breaks.

582
00:39:58.690 --> 00:40:00.870
Um,
so that,
that is an option for sure.

583
00:40:02.010 --> 00:40:05.770
I just had a question with regards to the vibration damping at the seat.

584
00:40:05.830 --> 00:40:08.040
I'm just wondering if what the cantilevered monocoque design,

585
00:40:08.041 --> 00:40:11.460
if it's better or worse than the p five from the rider perspective.

586
00:40:11.490 --> 00:40:15.870
Maybe that's a question.
Yeah,
that's a really interesting question.
Um,
I think,

587
00:40:16.440 --> 00:40:20.220
you know,
Sarah might be able to talk a little bit about how she feels about it,

588
00:40:20.221 --> 00:40:22.770
but,
um,
generally the,

589
00:40:22.920 --> 00:40:26.400
the deflections at the saddler are very small.
Um,

590
00:40:26.430 --> 00:40:30.460
but there seems to be an effect of less of,
um,

591
00:40:30.480 --> 00:40:34.740
vibration transfer in terms of a road texture kind of feel.

592
00:40:35.040 --> 00:40:39.060
And so some people have commented on a comfort aspect that they feel it's more

593
00:40:39.061 --> 00:40:43.060
comfortable.
Um,
but it's not floating around.
Um,

594
00:40:43.150 --> 00:40:46.680
it's not like you're changing your leg length by a significant amount and that's

595
00:40:46.681 --> 00:40:47.670
what we want to avoid.

596
00:40:48.900 --> 00:40:50.180
<v 1>Yeah.
I mean,
when I,
uh,</v>

597
00:40:50.870 --> 00:40:54.200
I was riding the bike and in the race and beforehand,
I mean,

598
00:40:54.201 --> 00:40:58.220
one of the things I initially noticed,
and I think a lot of us noticed,

599
00:40:58.221 --> 00:40:59.390
you wrote it where was,

600
00:40:59.391 --> 00:41:04.190
how smooth the ride was and how little vibration that we felt.
Um,

601
00:41:04.430 --> 00:41:07.340
but also as he said,
being able to maintain that stiffness,

602
00:41:07.341 --> 00:41:09.380
which was something that was really important to all of us.

603
00:41:10.200 --> 00:41:11.940
<v 2>You're given that you have,
you showed the,
uh,</v>

604
00:41:11.941 --> 00:41:15.720
the UCI box that you needed to conform to then.
Yeah.
So,
given that,

605
00:41:15.780 --> 00:41:20.780
how do you get away with not having the Rear Triangle and be compliant on the

606
00:41:21.090 --> 00:41:22.740
roofs days?
Uh,

607
00:41:22.830 --> 00:41:26.700
you mean like how are we UCI complaint without having a rear steer?
We're not,

608
00:41:26.880 --> 00:41:29.520
oh yeah.

609
00:41:31.810 --> 00:41:33.290
No,
but that's a good question.
You're like,

610
00:41:33.291 --> 00:41:36.200
that's our intentional diversion from the UCI.

611
00:41:36.201 --> 00:41:40.680
So there's a separate line now for this UCI illegal bike.
Yeah,

612
00:41:42.350 --> 00:41:45.860
<v 3>sorry,
I was so,
yeah,
my question was about UCI also.
So what's the,</v>

613
00:41:45.920 --> 00:41:48.320
who's the intended audience for this?
I mean,
is this,

614
00:41:49.160 --> 00:41:54.160
is this for iron man triathlons or Olympics or which direction are you going in?

615
00:41:54.650 --> 00:41:58.060
<v 2>Yeah,
definitely.
Uh,
triathletes,
um,</v>

616
00:41:58.250 --> 00:42:01.130
long distance track athletes.
Um,

617
00:42:01.550 --> 00:42:05.450
and uh,
well,
yeah,

618
00:42:05.451 --> 00:42:08.740
some Olympic yet for sure.
Um,
but yeah,
we're,

619
00:42:08.770 --> 00:42:12.800
we're not targeting that,
that tt racer with this bike.

620
00:42:13.460 --> 00:42:15.980
That's our p five would provide that.

621
00:42:18.030 --> 00:42:19.900
<v 3>A question on how you,
uh,</v>

622
00:42:19.950 --> 00:42:24.950
came up with the final selection of the y frame design after he did all the

623
00:42:25.501 --> 00:42:27.870
typical topographic iterations,

624
00:42:27.871 --> 00:42:32.871
it showed that it didn't look like the beam style frame was the coaches.

625
00:42:33.021 --> 00:42:36.540
It's strictly for aerodynamics.
Did you take into consideration,

626
00:42:36.541 --> 00:42:41.370
I guess the original Cervelo,
the green one with Baraki?
Oh yes.

627
00:42:41.670 --> 00:42:45.420
Was that one of the considerations from the research of back then?
When is this?

628
00:42:45.720 --> 00:42:47.220
Yeah,
that's an interesting question.
So

629
00:42:47.540 --> 00:42:48.280
<v 2>the,</v>

630
00:42:48.280 --> 00:42:52.670
he was not a driving a design inspiration.

631
00:42:53.300 --> 00:42:57.810
It was kind of a fund result when we started realizing that hey wait,

632
00:42:57.820 --> 00:42:59.990
this kind of looks like the first Cervelo,

633
00:43:00.770 --> 00:43:04.090
but definitely not a driving factor.
Um,

634
00:43:05.210 --> 00:43:06.980
the uh,
really,
you know,

635
00:43:06.981 --> 00:43:11.981
as the storage and the bottle placement that was driving more than anything.

636
00:43:12.530 --> 00:43:17.480
Um,
when we,
when I showed those different configurations for,
um,

637
00:43:17.630 --> 00:43:21.920
having sort of a seat tube and no top tube or having the top tube and no c to

638
00:43:22.370 --> 00:43:25.370
um,
both those were contenders aerodynamically.

639
00:43:25.610 --> 00:43:29.810
And so we were really trying to balance everything at once to come up with this.

640
00:43:29.811 --> 00:43:34.610
So this one was helping us structurally versus the other orientation.

641
00:43:35.010 --> 00:43:36.830
Um,
uh,
doing very well.

642
00:43:36.831 --> 00:43:41.270
I are dynamically and then also giving us this option for this optional storage

643
00:43:41.300 --> 00:43:42.133
volume

644
00:43:44.420 --> 00:43:46.580
<v 5>you think's the most for the great presentation.
Uh,</v>

645
00:43:46.590 --> 00:43:50.280
I remember you were supposed to release the bike around like six months ago and

646
00:43:50.281 --> 00:43:51.240
we knew decided,
no,

647
00:43:51.241 --> 00:43:54.540
we're not going to get your leads from six months and it's probably coming.

648
00:43:54.541 --> 00:43:55.680
You can talk openly about it,

649
00:43:55.681 --> 00:43:59.450
but I'm just curious if you have some more color about what,
what,

650
00:43:59.530 --> 00:44:02.060
why did you decide to delete and what you would probably since then.

651
00:44:02.660 --> 00:44:07.020
<v 2>Yeah.
Is it,
um,
it's no one big thing in particular.
I'm calm.</v>

652
00:44:07.160 --> 00:44:08.180
Some people were saying,
oh,

653
00:44:08.181 --> 00:44:11.780
did you decide at the last minute to add disc brakes or something like that.
Um,

654
00:44:11.781 --> 00:44:14.060
it wasn't,
it wasn't that kind of decision.

655
00:44:14.330 --> 00:44:18.020
It was really just making sure that we're at the point where we're happy with

656
00:44:18.021 --> 00:44:22.760
the product,
getting all those little things right.
Making sure,

657
00:44:22.910 --> 00:44:27.230
you know,
we're,
we're going through all are very stringent tests.

658
00:44:27.620 --> 00:44:29.020
Um,
and,

659
00:44:29.320 --> 00:44:34.140
and just making sure we had it and available and available and available.

660
00:44:34.141 --> 00:44:38.790
Like on the day of the launch,
we had how many bikes sick,

661
00:44:38.980 --> 00:44:41.820
80,
80 bikes in the stores.
Um,

662
00:44:41.821 --> 00:44:45.210
so then they could bring them out and have them on display and sell them.

663
00:44:45.570 --> 00:44:49.230
And so we really wanted that to be ready,
ready as well.

664
00:44:50.490 --> 00:44:54.820
<v 6>Yeah,
yeah,
that's very true.
Just to add on to it,
the travel keys for example,</v>

665
00:44:54.830 --> 00:44:59.000
it wasn't ready at all,
so that's sort of the,

666
00:44:59.020 --> 00:45:02.620
all the details that probably we are also busy.
You,

667
00:45:02.770 --> 00:45:04.490
you saw that it's a big part of the story.

668
00:45:04.491 --> 00:45:07.730
It's an accessory yet it's a big part of the story.

669
00:45:08.090 --> 00:45:10.400
The availabilities or so key.

670
00:45:11.000 --> 00:45:13.970
In the past we never launch a bike,

671
00:45:15.170 --> 00:45:19.670
which is there for lunch available right on for every market globally.

672
00:45:19.880 --> 00:45:23.630
So you said 80 but it's a 120 all over the world,

673
00:45:24.140 --> 00:45:25.360
so that has never happened.

674
00:45:26.030 --> 00:45:31.030
That's 80 shops and hundred and 20 bags which we are available on the force and

675
00:45:32.121 --> 00:45:33.350
that we continue to make.

676
00:45:33.410 --> 00:45:38.410
Obviously in the US it's all about details as useful,

677
00:45:38.530 --> 00:45:42.510
so everything was there,
but just to refine everything,
you know and that's nice.

678
00:45:42.530 --> 00:45:46.220
Why we decided to wear it.
It was a marketing decision,

679
00:45:47.210 --> 00:45:51.570
not engineering.
And also probably a marketing mistake to say we already,

680
00:45:51.590 --> 00:45:55.930
when we realized maybe we are not,
I'm saying that because I'm,

681
00:45:56.210 --> 00:46:00.090
I'm in charge of the marketing part.
Uh,

682
00:46:01.250 --> 00:46:03.050
I have a question about the foreign bottle.

683
00:46:03.650 --> 00:46:07.190
Basically it's a bottle need to be a mountain to be to drink,
right?

684
00:46:07.280 --> 00:46:10.970
But there are bottles with a small tube that you can just drink.

685
00:46:11.490 --> 00:46:16.490
So is the prop your proposal to have this kind of Basel III or is sample

686
00:46:16.790 --> 00:46:19.940
<v 2>and like any bottle it can be,
yes.
Good question.</v>

687
00:46:19.941 --> 00:46:24.941
So what we wanted was we didn't want to restrict anybody to a certain type of

688
00:46:25.311 --> 00:46:28.970
bottle that you couldn't just pass away while you're writing.

689
00:46:29.360 --> 00:46:34.360
So we're showing it with round bottles because that's the lowest stress option.

690
00:46:35.660 --> 00:46:38.300
You can grab a bottle of Gatorade bottle,

691
00:46:38.420 --> 00:46:43.420
generic Gatorade or a water bottle and stick it in and toss that one before you

692
00:46:44.631 --> 00:46:48.920
get to the end of the aid station.
But at the same time,

693
00:46:48.950 --> 00:46:53.180
if you want to run those kinds of bottles,
then that's great because,
uh,
if he,

694
00:46:53.181 --> 00:46:53.871
if you know,

695
00:46:53.871 --> 00:46:57.610
maybe you have a mixed drink that you can to keep there the whole time,
um,

696
00:46:57.770 --> 00:47:01.040
then you can choose to do that and you have that Straw and you maybe you can

697
00:47:01.130 --> 00:47:02.570
stay more Arrow when you use that.

698
00:47:02.690 --> 00:47:06.380
So we definitely recommend like choosing the bottles that you want to use.

699
00:47:06.560 --> 00:47:09.250
But we didn't want to design our own bottle that you had to,

700
00:47:09.560 --> 00:47:10.730
you had to use all the time.

701
00:47:11.340 --> 00:47:14.720
A quick question for you said 120 available worldwide.
What's,
uh,

702
00:47:14.810 --> 00:47:17.090
what is your runway look like?
If you can even talk about that.

703
00:47:17.091 --> 00:47:18.320
When will the bike be available?

704
00:47:18.430 --> 00:47:22.700
Are you going to ship it like this or will be frame only like talk about

705
00:47:22.701 --> 00:47:25.130
configuration and PR and actually how much does it cost?

706
00:47:27.910 --> 00:47:30.520
It's a very good,
uh,

707
00:47:30.520 --> 00:47:34.690
<v 6>so it's already available.
And if,
if you go around here,
we are,</v>

708
00:47:34.810 --> 00:47:36.020
we're working with beyond a,

709
00:47:36.160 --> 00:47:39.550
so it's like actually you can already go there and actually I think already won

710
00:47:40.170 --> 00:47:43.750
your chase one bike.
That was two days ago or three days ago.

711
00:47:44.560 --> 00:47:46.630
Uh,
so how much,

712
00:47:46.660 --> 00:47:51.660
so it comes exactly like it is okay with those envy weaves some eat up,

713
00:47:52.620 --> 00:47:57.070
uh,
every scene except butter cage.
So meaning many,

714
00:47:57.071 --> 00:48:01.060
everything that comes with it,
everything including even this also.

715
00:48:01.310 --> 00:48:04.870
So travel case comes as an accessory.

716
00:48:05.920 --> 00:48:10.920
And so like this again and view is Samit up $15,000 available now.

717
00:48:11.920 --> 00:48:16.610
Starting later in December.
First of this umbrella,
we'll also have it with you.

718
00:48:16.660 --> 00:48:20.470
We'll take out the ITU headwinds and uh,

719
00:48:20.500 --> 00:48:25.240
auto crank at fifth at $11,000.
Okay,

720
00:48:25.241 --> 00:48:29.930
so any doesn't come as a,
as a frame set it,
Kim's like,

721
00:48:30.010 --> 00:48:33.280
it comes like this
and the bag,

722
00:48:33.281 --> 00:48:35.970
the bag is $849.

723
00:48:36.880 --> 00:48:39.800
<v 3>Um,
I want to ask a question.
I don't know if,
you know,
our,</v>

724
00:48:39.801 --> 00:48:41.970
our friends down in Morgan Hill came up with a,
uh,

725
00:48:42.100 --> 00:48:44.850
another answer to UCI and their rules.
Um,

726
00:48:44.950 --> 00:48:47.860
as a concept pike I think you guys to great.
They actually made it to market,

727
00:48:48.430 --> 00:48:50.860
but they had some funny ideas,
like really,
really big back wheels.

728
00:48:50.890 --> 00:48:55.890
I was wondering if you guys saw the f Uci bike and ideas about how they had

729
00:48:57.471 --> 00:48:58.690
approached it,
where I,
you guys had.

730
00:49:00.470 --> 00:49:03.670
<v 2>Yeah.
Um,
I mean for us,
you know,</v>

731
00:49:03.680 --> 00:49:08.680
it's balancing taking the big risks and making something that we can actually

732
00:49:08.841 --> 00:49:12.710
get to market.
Right.
Just like you said.
Um,
you know,
we're,

733
00:49:12.711 --> 00:49:15.050
we're always choosing what things are going to take on.
There's,

734
00:49:15.500 --> 00:49:20.240
there's a lot of things that are still on the wall in the office.
Um,
but uh,

735
00:49:20.840 --> 00:49:24.680
yeah,
I'm thinking I'm happy with sort of the approach,
how far we went with it.

736
00:49:25.370 --> 00:49:26.060
<v 3>Yeah.</v>

737
00:49:26.060 --> 00:49:30.010
I have a question about the aerodynamic comparison that you did with the p five.

738
00:49:30.120 --> 00:49:33.650
Um,
so I think what you said was that you,

739
00:49:33.680 --> 00:49:36.290
you load this bike fully up,

740
00:49:36.291 --> 00:49:39.980
just like the average person would load up their bike and then you load it up

741
00:49:39.981 --> 00:49:41.510
the p five in the same way.

742
00:49:42.170 --> 00:49:45.650
But I guess for the foster people,

743
00:49:45.880 --> 00:49:50.000
I don't think they load up their bikes.
Just like the average person,

744
00:49:50.001 --> 00:49:54.710
they don't take like five things to the front tube and stuff like that.
Right.

745
00:49:54.711 --> 00:49:59.420
So in that case,
is,
is the different still 30 grams or is it,

746
00:49:59.421 --> 00:50:00.254
is it less?

747
00:50:00.740 --> 00:50:05.180
<v 2>Yeah,
so we find that,
um,
it's more distance related,</v>

748
00:50:05.181 --> 00:50:07.660
I would say then speed related.
Um,

749
00:50:07.790 --> 00:50:10.760
there's definitely some of our pros that have a lot of stuff that they take with

750
00:50:10.761 --> 00:50:13.420
them.
Um,
but um,

751
00:50:13.580 --> 00:50:17.630
what's neat is that we also compared the bikes with nothing on them.

752
00:50:17.690 --> 00:50:22.570
So like a very clean,
lean set up as you would do,
like a,

753
00:50:23.090 --> 00:50:27.920
a t t I guess.
Um,
even though that's not the intended use.
Um,

754
00:50:28.160 --> 00:50:33.140
and even in that case,
um,
we're just a little bit faster than a p five.
Okay.

755
00:50:33.320 --> 00:50:37.910
So,
um,
that's kind of neat that it doesn't matter the situation.

756
00:50:38.180 --> 00:50:41.330
Um,
it's still,
uh,
an aero bike.
Yes.

757
00:50:41.570 --> 00:50:45.710
<v 1>Um,
and just to talk a little bit about that.
So for,
uh,
for me in an Ironman,</v>

758
00:50:46.130 --> 00:50:47.620
I usually carry,
um,

759
00:50:48.020 --> 00:50:52.520
five packages of cliff box and five Giles with me cause I eat 300 calories an

760
00:50:52.521 --> 00:50:55.870
hour.
Um,
and so on the p five,

761
00:50:55.871 --> 00:51:00.210
previously I would have had a bento box in the front,
next lab at Toebox,
um,

762
00:51:00.230 --> 00:51:04.010
that I would put stuff into.
But I was typically taping,
uh,

763
00:51:04.070 --> 00:51:07.640
for gels or four or five jobs onto the top tube here.

764
00:51:08.090 --> 00:51:11.610
And then another two or three jobs on to,
um,

765
00:51:11.710 --> 00:51:16.640
just until the stem,
the stem.
Um,
so in,
um,

766
00:51:16.670 --> 00:51:20.830
the race on Saturday,
I fit all of my nutrition into,

767
00:51:21.210 --> 00:51:25.130
um,
into the box with the exception of one gel,

768
00:51:25.160 --> 00:51:30.020
which I put just on my sports bra.
So it was,

769
00:51:30.021 --> 00:51:32.460
um,
it was a lot more convenient,
um,

770
00:51:32.570 --> 00:51:37.520
from that perspective and um,
and very accommodating.
And so I think,

771
00:51:37.730 --> 00:51:40.990
you know,
as you were saying,
you know,
for people who maybe it not be as fast,

772
00:51:41.000 --> 00:51:43.790
they might bring like sandwiches with them and then they can put that in the,

773
00:51:44.050 --> 00:51:47.150
you know,
in the box over there.
You're not going to fit the sandwich necessarily.

774
00:51:47.151 --> 00:51:49.370
And,
and yeah.
You know,
but,
um,

775
00:51:49.400 --> 00:51:51.690
but we still do need to carry quite a bit of nutrition and,

776
00:51:51.691 --> 00:51:54.710
and it really does accommodate that even for people who are faster.

777
00:51:55.630 --> 00:51:59.690
I really want to thank David and steal from the team and everybody else sits

778
00:51:59.691 --> 00:52:01.280
here.
And if we could give him a big round of applause.

779
00:52:01.780 --> 00:52:06.780
<v 0>[inaudible].</v>
