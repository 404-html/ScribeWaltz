1
00:00:06.110 --> 00:00:11.110
I'm really pleased to have Dr Joe Rankin here today to talk about her new book,

2
00:00:12.040 --> 00:00:16.730
um,
a people's history of computing in the United States.
And I got that right.

3
00:00:17.360 --> 00:00:20.090
Uh,
and,
uh,

4
00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:25.280
I sort of discovered the book,
you know,
browsing on the web and it,

5
00:00:25.510 --> 00:00:25.760
you know,

6
00:00:25.760 --> 00:00:30.230
it talked about sort of early computing experiences and I really connected with

7
00:00:31.010 --> 00:00:34.930
basic,
which is,
which is going to come up a lot in the book.
Um,

8
00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:37.790
I started programming in basic and you know,

9
00:00:37.791 --> 00:00:42.260
like a home computer or when I was a kid and,
uh,

10
00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:43.920
really enjoyed,
uh,
um,

11
00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:48.140
a book called 101 basic computer games that were very simple games.
And,

12
00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:52.280
and it's interesting that,
uh,
as it became a professional programmer,

13
00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:55.790
I mostly spend time think about how,
um,
how much,

14
00:00:55.791 --> 00:01:00.620
I didn't really approve of basic,
it was not a serious language,
right?
Uh,

15
00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:03.380
but,
uh,
you know,
in like in thinking about it or reading the book,

16
00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:07.610
I came to remember how much fun it was and how,
like,

17
00:01:07.611 --> 00:01:10.220
how you turned on a computer and there was basic in front of you,
right?
Like,

18
00:01:10.221 --> 00:01:10.440
you know,

19
00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:13.910
you immediately got the interpreter prompter and that was pretty amazing.

20
00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:18.940
And I thought the message of the book lined up so well with the three respects.

21
00:01:19.251 --> 00:01:22.430
We're trying to think about it.
Google,
um,
um,

22
00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:27.470
one respect the user since this is really all about letting users a program the

23
00:01:27.471 --> 00:01:29.630
computer and interact with it more directly.

24
00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:34.430
And I thought this book was particularly interesting when we think about,

25
00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:35.323
um,

26
00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:40.630
respecting the opportunity because we have a big business that um,

27
00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:44.480
you know,
sells computing to,
to consumers.
You know,

28
00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:49.160
we either pay through ads or through the cloud computing business,
um,

29
00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:53.550
and that's kind of intention or,
or you know,
uh,

30
00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:57.470
the business relationship is a little bit intention with empowering people to

31
00:01:57.471 --> 00:02:01.040
create whatever they want.
Now,
clearly clouds sort of supports that as well.

32
00:02:01.041 --> 00:02:02.480
But the,
um,

33
00:02:03.650 --> 00:02:07.130
I think the early idea of search was to make the web more powerful,
right?

34
00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:11.810
That as the web got better,
uh,
Google got better and as Google have better,

35
00:02:11.811 --> 00:02:13.430
we made the web better for people.

36
00:02:13.431 --> 00:02:18.431
And I think there's a little bit of a tension between that and a and running a

37
00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:21.530
large corporation and then a profitable business.

38
00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:26.330
And I thought some of the stories you had to tell really help remind us of how

39
00:02:26.331 --> 00:02:31.040
many people are creators and,
and how much creativity we can unlock when we,

40
00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:36.040
when we really think about them and the opportunities we create for them.
Um,

41
00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:39.380
so that's,
that's why I was so excited to have you come and talk about this book.

42
00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:43.520
Uh,
so Dr Rankin is a historian,
uh,
but in chatting with her today,

43
00:02:43.521 --> 00:02:46.730
I found out she was also a math major at Dartmouth.

44
00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:49.310
She has written some crypto code.
Uh,

45
00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:52.640
so I think she brings a really interesting perspective to the whole story.

46
00:02:52.850 --> 00:02:54.170
So let me turn it over to her.

47
00:02:54.970 --> 00:02:59.970
Thank you Jeremy for that introduction and thank you all being here today.

48
00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:05.880
<v 2>I am so excited to have the opportunity to speak with you and speak with Google.</v>

49
00:03:06.850 --> 00:03:09.100
I am just going to jump right in.

50
00:03:12.410 --> 00:03:16.060
All right.
So in 1958,

51
00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:21.420
Tom Kurtz wanted to run a computer program that I hear is Tom Kurtz.

52
00:03:22.090 --> 00:03:26.560
Circa 1958 so to do this,
to run his computer program,

53
00:03:26.830 --> 00:03:31.830
he woke up early one morning and traveled about five miles from his home in

54
00:03:32.621 --> 00:03:35.860
Hanover,
New Hampshire to White River junction,
Vermont.

55
00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:40.840
He carried with him a steel box that looked like this one.

56
00:03:41.470 --> 00:03:43.840
And when he got to White River junction,
Vermont,

57
00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:48.970
he boarded the six 20 morning train to Boston,

58
00:03:50.830 --> 00:03:51.663
Boston.

59
00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:56.760
He trades the train for a taxi to get to the computer center at Mit.

60
00:04:00.010 --> 00:04:02.950
Finally,
finally at Mit is computer center.

61
00:04:02.951 --> 00:04:07.951
He opens the box that he carries with him and it contains hundreds of cardboard

62
00:04:08.051 --> 00:04:08.884
cards.

63
00:04:08.980 --> 00:04:13.980
So some of those cards very carefully ordered and wrapped with an elastic band

64
00:04:15.460 --> 00:04:17.440
are his computer program.

65
00:04:17.650 --> 00:04:22.650
Other cards contain the programs of his colleagues at Dartmouth College where he

66
00:04:23.201 --> 00:04:25.840
is a professor in the math department.

67
00:04:26.470 --> 00:04:31.180
So Dartmouth is a small liberal arts college during the 1950s it doesn't have

68
00:04:31.181 --> 00:04:33.670
its own computer.
So,
uh,

69
00:04:34.330 --> 00:04:38.950
the Dartmouth professors use the computing resources at Mit.

70
00:04:39.730 --> 00:04:44.730
So curt's hands his stack of punched cards over to the operator at the MIT

71
00:04:45.581 --> 00:04:49.990
computer center and walks away hours later.

72
00:04:49.991 --> 00:04:51.130
At the end of the day,

73
00:04:51.131 --> 00:04:55.450
he goes back to the computer center to pick up his cards and pick out,

74
00:04:55.540 --> 00:05:00.540
pick up the very precious printout results of his computer program and it gets

75
00:05:01.691 --> 00:05:06.610
on the train back home and he sees of course some error messages.

76
00:05:07.360 --> 00:05:11.830
What does this mean?
Well,
it means he's going to have to revise his program,

77
00:05:11.890 --> 00:05:16.890
repunched the cards and repeat this process all over again two weeks later.

78
00:05:18.820 --> 00:05:23.820
So I love starting with the story because it shows that individual access to

79
00:05:24.341 --> 00:05:29.341
computing in 1958 was so rare and so valuable that Tom Kurtz was willing to

80
00:05:30.461 --> 00:05:34.300
spend a whole day to receive a few minutes,

81
00:05:34.960 --> 00:05:38.020
maybe a few seconds of access to computing.

82
00:05:38.950 --> 00:05:43.950
And it also really shows Tom's perspective as a user.

83
00:05:44.980 --> 00:05:47.920
So this brings me to my research.

84
00:05:48.610 --> 00:05:52.600
The question that guides my research is what does it mean to write histories of

85
00:05:52.601 --> 00:05:56.020
computing and of technology from the user?

86
00:05:57.620 --> 00:06:02.620
My book a people's history of computing in the United States answers that

87
00:06:02.781 --> 00:06:06.350
question.
The people in this people's history,

88
00:06:06.380 --> 00:06:09.200
our students and educators,

89
00:06:09.201 --> 00:06:14.201
people like Tom Kurtz who built and used academic computing networks during the

90
00:06:16.311 --> 00:06:21.311
1960s and the 1970s so mine is a history of our digital age that really

91
00:06:22.851 --> 00:06:27.851
emphasizes creativity and collaboration and community.

92
00:06:28.790 --> 00:06:32.090
So for the next 15 minutes or so,

93
00:06:32.150 --> 00:06:37.150
I'm going to tell you how Kurtz and thousands of other students and educators

94
00:06:37.670 --> 00:06:42.670
built a computing network that's spanned new England during the 1960s and I want

95
00:06:44.481 --> 00:06:49.130
to show you how computing was interwoven in their daily lives.

96
00:06:49.131 --> 00:06:52.790
It was part of their status,
their sports,

97
00:06:53.150 --> 00:06:56.030
their dates they're dating and their gaming.

98
00:06:56.270 --> 00:06:59.720
And finally I will conclude with an opportunity.

99
00:07:01.400 --> 00:07:06.400
So all that time on the train got Kurds to thinking there has to be a better way

100
00:07:06.561 --> 00:07:11.000
to do this.
And a few years after that 1958 train ride,

101
00:07:11.390 --> 00:07:16.390
he proposed a better way of computing to a fellow math professor at Dartmouth,

102
00:07:17.960 --> 00:07:22.460
John Kemeny.
And Kurt's pitched three related ideas.

103
00:07:22.490 --> 00:07:26.720
First,
all students at the college should have access to computing.

104
00:07:27.110 --> 00:07:30.070
And this is important,
not just the scientists or the engineers,

105
00:07:30.100 --> 00:07:33.800
the mathematicians,
but everyone,
regardless of what they were studying,

106
00:07:34.670 --> 00:07:39.170
he also advocated that computing should be free for the students,

107
00:07:39.171 --> 00:07:42.410
not something they would have to pay for.
And finally,

108
00:07:42.411 --> 00:07:46.520
he thought the first two things could be accomplished by a then mode of

109
00:07:46.521 --> 00:07:49.340
computing known as time sharing.

110
00:07:50.210 --> 00:07:55.210
So what's timesharing timesharing as a form of computing in which multiple

111
00:07:55.761 --> 00:07:56.720
terminals,

112
00:07:56.810 --> 00:08:01.810
multiple users are simultaneously connected to a single mainframe computer.

113
00:08:02.720 --> 00:08:06.910
It's a network because they're connected by phone lines.
Um,
so and that,

114
00:08:07.010 --> 00:08:09.650
and not necessarily a network like we think of today,

115
00:08:09.651 --> 00:08:14.360
but all of those terminals can still communicate with each other via the

116
00:08:14.370 --> 00:08:16.400
mainframe.
Um,

117
00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:21.230
the terminals are connected to the mainframe by long distance phone lines or

118
00:08:21.231 --> 00:08:25.780
local phone lines as the case may be.
And the terminals look like this.
Um,

119
00:08:25.790 --> 00:08:30.790
so they're teletype writers are teletypes originally used for telegraphy then

120
00:08:31.461 --> 00:08:36.410
used for computing and like an old fashioned typewriter with a printer attached.

121
00:08:36.411 --> 00:08:41.300
So users would enter their programs,
see them sort of printed out,

122
00:08:41.301 --> 00:08:46.301
and then the computer would communicate back to the user by printing out a

123
00:08:48.350 --> 00:08:50.690
program results on the teletype writer.

124
00:08:50.691 --> 00:08:55.691
So what this means is an individual user is able to write and debug a program in

125
00:08:58.230 --> 00:09:01.290
minutes,
not hours or weeks.

126
00:09:04.040 --> 00:09:05.060
So when Kurt's,

127
00:09:05.061 --> 00:09:09.440
I'm Kemeny seek funding for their network,

128
00:09:09.590 --> 00:09:14.450
what they emphasize is that at most other university competing centers during

129
00:09:14.451 --> 00:09:19.451
the 1960s those universities are focused on maximizing the resources of the

130
00:09:20.031 --> 00:09:23.780
computer computers,
very large,
very expensive.

131
00:09:23.781 --> 00:09:27.470
The most efficient thing to do is to keep them running as much as possible,

132
00:09:27.471 --> 00:09:31.640
but that doesn't do a lot of good for the people using the computers.

133
00:09:31.820 --> 00:09:32.481
Instead,

134
00:09:32.481 --> 00:09:37.481
Kemeny and Kurt say we want to build a network that will be most convenient for

135
00:09:38.181 --> 00:09:43.181
that user to enable as much creativity and productivity as possible for those

136
00:09:44.931 --> 00:09:49.340
users.
Rather than maximizing the efficiency of the computer,

137
00:09:53.130 --> 00:09:54.360
they get their funding.

138
00:09:54.900 --> 00:09:59.370
Kurt's writes a series of memos to guide the development efforts.

139
00:09:59.371 --> 00:10:00.690
And at this point I should say,

140
00:10:00.691 --> 00:10:05.691
this network is programmed and developed by Dartmouth undergraduate students.

141
00:10:07.080 --> 00:10:09.300
And Kurtz specifies,

142
00:10:09.360 --> 00:10:14.360
and this is a quote in all cases where there is a choice between simplicity and

143
00:10:14.941 --> 00:10:18.450
efficiency.
Simplicity is chosen.

144
00:10:18.870 --> 00:10:23.870
Every effort will be made to design a system convenient for the user.

145
00:10:24.840 --> 00:10:29.840
So I love this because clearly this is respect for the user and this is what it

146
00:10:30.511 --> 00:10:35.511
looks like for Kemeny and Kurds circa 1963 and at this point,

147
00:10:36.271 --> 00:10:39.630
I'm just going to say at the Dartmouth system,

148
00:10:39.631 --> 00:10:41.820
the network was wildly popular.

149
00:10:42.030 --> 00:10:46.950
It was implemented in 1964 by 1968 on campus,

150
00:10:46.980 --> 00:10:50.490
80% of the students are regularly using the network,

151
00:10:50.520 --> 00:10:54.400
they know basic and they program comfortably.
Um,

152
00:10:54.401 --> 00:10:59.220
and 40% of the faculty are regularly using the network and basic.

153
00:11:02.920 --> 00:11:03.610
<v 3>But,</v>

154
00:11:03.610 --> 00:11:07.690
<v 2>and this is equally important,
this sort of generic idea,</v>

155
00:11:07.691 --> 00:11:12.691
just the word user on the Dartmouth network shows that that word mass,

156
00:11:14.800 --> 00:11:19.800
social and cultural hierarchies and norms and expectations,

157
00:11:20.500 --> 00:11:22.780
especially around gender.

158
00:11:23.560 --> 00:11:28.560
So Kemeny and Kurt's designed their time sharing network because they believed

159
00:11:28.661 --> 00:11:33.661
that their students who were all men during the 1960s,

160
00:11:33.671 --> 00:11:37.420
Dartmouth is still men only as an undergraduate institution.

161
00:11:37.450 --> 00:11:38.800
And during the 1960s,

162
00:11:38.801 --> 00:11:42.700
Dartmouth is almost exclusively white as an institution,

163
00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:46.900
that those white men would be the future leaders of the United States.

164
00:11:47.080 --> 00:11:51.460
And they thought that computing was essential to their future leadership of the

165
00:11:51.461 --> 00:11:52.540
United States.

166
00:11:52.930 --> 00:11:57.100
They also envisioned computing as an equalizer among their students.

167
00:11:57.101 --> 00:12:01.450
That all of the students having that access for free would be something of an

168
00:12:01.451 --> 00:12:02.770
equal opportunity.

169
00:12:03.610 --> 00:12:07.360
But this student saw it differently.

170
00:12:07.720 --> 00:12:12.640
The students who had programmed the network and continue to develop and maintain

171
00:12:12.641 --> 00:12:17.290
it really created a space and hierarchy for themselves based on their

172
00:12:17.291 --> 00:12:19.510
familiarity with that system.

173
00:12:19.900 --> 00:12:24.900
So they mocked their peers who thought of the teletypes as computers or her

174
00:12:25.031 --> 00:12:27.370
complained.
If a teletype wasn't working,

175
00:12:27.371 --> 00:12:31.870
that the computer wasn't working and they played practical jokes,

176
00:12:32.020 --> 00:12:34.990
um,
substituting strings of meaningless,

177
00:12:35.260 --> 00:12:40.260
meaningless text into the output of a program that somebody had spent hours or

178
00:12:41.440 --> 00:12:42.273
days writing.

179
00:12:45.340 --> 00:12:47.680
These programmer in student peers,
however,

180
00:12:47.681 --> 00:12:52.681
were United in their enthusiasm for football played on the field and on the

181
00:12:55.451 --> 00:12:56.284
network.

182
00:12:56.320 --> 00:13:01.320
So football to say that football dominated Dartmouth's culture during the 1960s

183
00:13:02.490 --> 00:13:04.960
is a bit of an understatement.
Dartmouth,
uh,

184
00:13:05.050 --> 00:13:10.050
won the Ivy League championship several times and really the campus,

185
00:13:10.450 --> 00:13:10.831
uh,

186
00:13:10.831 --> 00:13:15.831
and football went hand in hand as cultures and there were several versions of

187
00:13:16.091 --> 00:13:21.091
football FTB a l l like this was one of them that were developed and played on

188
00:13:21.191 --> 00:13:25.370
the network including a multiplayer version.
Um,

189
00:13:26.260 --> 00:13:30.400
so the popularity of the football on the network,

190
00:13:30.890 --> 00:13:31.390
uh,

191
00:13:31.390 --> 00:13:36.390
really mirrored the celebration of this very masculine macho sport on campus.

192
00:13:38.140 --> 00:13:43.140
The football games also provided an opportunity from women from nearby all

193
00:13:44.441 --> 00:13:49.441
women's colleges to travel to Hanover to socialize with the Dartmouth men.

194
00:13:50.260 --> 00:13:55.260
And many men recalled that they brought their dates to the campus computing

195
00:13:55.361 --> 00:14:00.220
centers before or after the games to like show off their computing prowess or

196
00:14:00.221 --> 00:14:03.190
show off their gaming expertise.

197
00:14:04.510 --> 00:14:09.510
Even though several of those women's colleges were also part of the Dartmouth

198
00:14:10.420 --> 00:14:14.560
Network,
which meant the women themselves were also computing as well.

199
00:14:15.310 --> 00:14:17.620
So in the course of my research,

200
00:14:17.621 --> 00:14:22.621
I was repeatedly struck by how many Dartmouth men wanted to tell me and did tell

201
00:14:22.811 --> 00:14:27.811
me stories about computing in connection with dating and how they really were

202
00:14:29.771 --> 00:14:33.550
reinforcing existing gender roles with their computing.

203
00:14:33.551 --> 00:14:35.500
So one told me,

204
00:14:35.501 --> 00:14:40.420
he used the teletype to print out this huge banner that said,

205
00:14:40.450 --> 00:14:44.860
hey girl and all caps,
hey girl,
I miss you.

206
00:14:45.370 --> 00:14:50.140
And he rolled up the huge banner and put it in a poster tube and mailed it to

207
00:14:50.141 --> 00:14:53.750
his then girlfriend who was attending college in New York.

208
00:14:54.170 --> 00:14:56.390
And now they've been married for almost 50 years.

209
00:14:56.540 --> 00:15:00.580
And this is one example like I could get,
I'm happy to give you more during Qa.

210
00:15:01.150 --> 00:15:05.930
Um,
but what do I mean by gender roles here?

211
00:15:05.930 --> 00:15:10.930
So remember we're talking the 1960s the cold war nuclear family was the norm,

212
00:15:13.400 --> 00:15:15.650
right?
This idea that there's a breadwinner,

213
00:15:15.651 --> 00:15:20.651
father and to domestic mother staying at home and some kids in suburbia,

214
00:15:22.370 --> 00:15:25.250
and we can see this even with competing.

215
00:15:25.251 --> 00:15:30.251
So John Kemeny goes on to become president of Dartmouth college and in 1966 the

216
00:15:31.341 --> 00:15:36.341
college's dedicating its brand new computing center and he gives a keynote

217
00:15:37.881 --> 00:15:42.170
speech at the dedication and he talks about how great it will be when everyone

218
00:15:42.171 --> 00:15:44.900
has terminals in their homes.
At this point,

219
00:15:44.901 --> 00:15:48.680
some faculty already have terminal and that terminals in their homes as part of

220
00:15:48.681 --> 00:15:49.514
the network.

221
00:15:49.970 --> 00:15:54.950
Any talks about how his wise using the terminals to do things like program their

222
00:15:54.951 --> 00:15:59.951
chores and planned balance diets and meals for their families and do their

223
00:16:01.281 --> 00:16:04.010
shopping online.
And those are the,

224
00:16:04.250 --> 00:16:08.420
that's the way that he sees women using computing.

225
00:16:09.280 --> 00:16:14.280
But while he's talking about housewives using computing to prepare balanced

226
00:16:14.511 --> 00:16:15.344
meals,

227
00:16:15.860 --> 00:16:20.860
there are women working at Dartmouth in that computer center in key roles.

228
00:16:21.860 --> 00:16:26.330
Um,
there was a disconnect there.
So Janet Price,

229
00:16:26.331 --> 00:16:28.670
Diane Hills,
Diane Mather,

230
00:16:29.180 --> 00:16:33.140
they're all doing various kinds of applications,
programming,
coding,

231
00:16:33.590 --> 00:16:37.330
Nancy broadhead manages user services.
Um,

232
00:16:37.430 --> 00:16:40.970
the two Diane's are also managing the software library.

233
00:16:42.230 --> 00:16:44.150
And the examples go on.

234
00:16:44.750 --> 00:16:49.750
I bring this up because these women were not exceptions to the norm,

235
00:16:50.420 --> 00:16:55.420
but rather represented the range of possibilities for women doing professional

236
00:16:55.551 --> 00:16:59.720
computing in the United States in the 1960s

237
00:17:01.910 --> 00:17:03.500
and as I mentioned,

238
00:17:03.560 --> 00:17:08.300
many of the college women themselves had access to computing at their own

239
00:17:08.301 --> 00:17:11.760
colleges.
They too are doing this personal computing,

240
00:17:11.770 --> 00:17:16.770
this social networking through the Dartmouth network during the 1960s.

241
00:17:17.811 --> 00:17:22.811
The network encompass tens of colleges and high schools from Connecticut to

242
00:17:24.021 --> 00:17:24.321
Maine.

243
00:17:24.321 --> 00:17:28.850
So this is a map of about 20 of the high schools that were connected to the

244
00:17:28.851 --> 00:17:33.851
network during the 1960s some were in very poor rural farming communities.

245
00:17:35.810 --> 00:17:39.170
Others were elite,
prestigious,

246
00:17:39.230 --> 00:17:42.350
affluent boarding schools,
a huge range.

247
00:17:45.100 --> 00:17:49.090
The students,
however,
everywhere they loved the network,

248
00:17:49.110 --> 00:17:52.800
they loved programming and creating and basic.

249
00:17:53.280 --> 00:17:57.870
They kept their teletypes running 12 hours a day,
six days a week.

250
00:17:58.410 --> 00:18:01.560
Some of them even woke up at four o'clock in the morning.

251
00:18:01.590 --> 00:18:05.880
High school areas like high schoolers waking up at four o'clock voluntarily just

252
00:18:05.881 --> 00:18:08.970
because they want to get on the network and that's when they can do it.

253
00:18:09.990 --> 00:18:14.970
They created a multitude of imaginative games and programs.

254
00:18:14.971 --> 00:18:19.080
These are just some of the examples.
High School newspaper layout,

255
00:18:19.220 --> 00:18:22.320
battle ship bullying and more.

256
00:18:24.320 --> 00:18:25.153
<v 3>But</v>

257
00:18:25.550 --> 00:18:26.810
<v 2>once again,</v>

258
00:18:27.230 --> 00:18:30.590
this attempt to sort of provide equal access,

259
00:18:30.591 --> 00:18:32.660
equal opportunities through computing.

260
00:18:33.380 --> 00:18:37.550
It didn't quite pan out that way.
Why?

261
00:18:38.480 --> 00:18:39.230
Well,

262
00:18:39.230 --> 00:18:44.230
boys and young men had much more access to the Dartmouth network then girls.

263
00:18:44.930 --> 00:18:46.700
So during the 1960s,

264
00:18:46.880 --> 00:18:50.960
every single private school that was connected to the network was boys only.

265
00:18:52.520 --> 00:18:57.520
And those private schools had 72 hours of teletype access each week compared to

266
00:18:58.401 --> 00:19:01.490
the 40 hours for pride or for public schools.

267
00:19:01.760 --> 00:19:06.760
So why is it a private schools have almost double the access time,

268
00:19:07.191 --> 00:19:11.720
the network time being shared with compared with a public school.

269
00:19:11.721 --> 00:19:16.721
Boys and girls and the boys are often in sort of newsletters about the program

270
00:19:19.250 --> 00:19:20.031
reports.

271
00:19:20.031 --> 00:19:25.031
The boys are more often recognized for their programs even though girls are

272
00:19:25.191 --> 00:19:29.480
still writing these programs as well.
So again,

273
00:19:29.481 --> 00:19:34.481
keep in mind the 1960s although Korea expectations and educational opportunities

274
00:19:37.401 --> 00:19:38.840
for girls and women,

275
00:19:39.110 --> 00:19:42.650
we changed dramatically in the next decade.

276
00:19:43.040 --> 00:19:47.420
During the 1960s most of the girls attending these public schools in New England

277
00:19:47.421 --> 00:19:51.280
works back to be homemakers,
um,

278
00:19:51.281 --> 00:19:53.930
and to marry young.
And at the time,

279
00:19:53.931 --> 00:19:58.490
high school boys were enrolling in many more math and science classes.

280
00:19:58.520 --> 00:20:03.140
Then girls and the girls were just not encouraged in computing,

281
00:20:03.380 --> 00:20:08.240
even if they were interested,
but make no mistake,

282
00:20:08.480 --> 00:20:11.570
they were still competing.
So,
for example,

283
00:20:11.590 --> 00:20:14.480
13 year old Giulia Hawthorne,
um,

284
00:20:14.481 --> 00:20:17.660
wrote a game of checkers and basic,

285
00:20:17.840 --> 00:20:19.670
and there are more examples.

286
00:20:20.120 --> 00:20:22.820
It's just that the girls and women were not recognized.

287
00:20:22.821 --> 00:20:27.821
It recognized or supported as much as the boys and men and the Cold War gender

288
00:20:28.761 --> 00:20:33.140
norms helped a race,
their contribution contribution.

289
00:20:33.141 --> 00:20:37.730
So to us now,
50 years later,
all of this seems a little bit remarkable.

290
00:20:38.610 --> 00:20:39.443
<v 3>So</v>

291
00:20:41.610 --> 00:20:46.380
<v 2>Tom Kurtz and John Kemeny,
as I said,
they envisioned competing as an equalizer.</v>

292
00:20:46.410 --> 00:20:51.410
I think they were trying to implement a version of respect each other with this

293
00:20:52.571 --> 00:20:54.290
idea of computing for all.

294
00:20:55.280 --> 00:21:00.280
But that's not how it played out because society was not equal,

295
00:21:01.420 --> 00:21:01.781
right?

296
00:21:01.781 --> 00:21:06.430
There are different expectations we can clearly see for boys and girls,

297
00:21:06.790 --> 00:21:11.790
men and women and different levels of access and resources and recognition for

298
00:21:14.261 --> 00:21:16.090
everyone involved.

299
00:21:17.050 --> 00:21:22.050
So here I see the opportunity to recognize that computing was not divorced from

300
00:21:25.151 --> 00:21:30.151
the culture in which it arose Kemeny and carts and their students,

301
00:21:30.640 --> 00:21:34.630
they built the network with people like themselves in mind.

302
00:21:35.350 --> 00:21:39.250
And ditto for all of the students who created basic programs.

303
00:21:39.251 --> 00:21:41.830
They were thinking about themselves and their friends.

304
00:21:42.310 --> 00:21:46.060
And that is absolutely understandable,

305
00:21:46.930 --> 00:21:51.930
but it also points to the fact that technology is not a thing apart from society

306
00:21:55.570 --> 00:22:00.570
talking about tech people or separating out tech companies.

307
00:22:01.600 --> 00:22:06.600
That's a false dichotomy because it's always people who are creating,

308
00:22:07.450 --> 00:22:08.650
who are inventing,

309
00:22:08.680 --> 00:22:13.680
who are problem solving and moonshining and it's almost always that they're

310
00:22:14.080 --> 00:22:17.230
doing those things with other people in mind.

311
00:22:17.830 --> 00:22:20.650
Even if that's not explicitly stated.

312
00:22:21.610 --> 00:22:26.610
And often still the people who aren't recognized as Techie,

313
00:22:27.130 --> 00:22:30.370
the girls writing the basic programs,
teachers,

314
00:22:30.371 --> 00:22:32.440
cultivating computing communities,

315
00:22:32.470 --> 00:22:35.830
the women behind the scenes at Dart,
Miss Computer Center,

316
00:22:36.250 --> 00:22:39.490
there's still doing crucial technological work.

317
00:22:41.320 --> 00:22:45.520
So today,
all too often we talk about things,
right?

318
00:22:45.521 --> 00:22:49.750
We talk about our computers and our devices,
the Internet,

319
00:22:49.810 --> 00:22:52.060
the web,
the algorithm,

320
00:22:53.620 --> 00:22:57.520
and that makes all of those things seem disconnected from us,

321
00:22:57.880 --> 00:23:01.270
from the people who create them and use them and transform them.

322
00:23:01.840 --> 00:23:06.840
So there's the opportunity by focusing on computing rather than computers,

323
00:23:09.400 --> 00:23:12.790
we gain a completely different picture of technology.

324
00:23:13.860 --> 00:23:18.090
Will you listen for and hear the voices not usually heard.

325
00:23:18.900 --> 00:23:23.900
And we search for and find the stories that had been overlooked are never told

326
00:23:25.620 --> 00:23:26.730
in the first place.

327
00:23:27.660 --> 00:23:32.660
And we remember that technology has always been about people.

328
00:23:36.200 --> 00:23:37.033
<v 1>Thanks.</v>

329
00:23:47.350 --> 00:23:50.950
We'll switch it back to them and multiple cameras and

330
00:23:54.240 --> 00:23:58.190
I think we need,
need a second microphone.

331
00:23:59.470 --> 00:24:02.780
Okay.
I will going to commit some notes.
So,

332
00:24:05.370 --> 00:24:07.230
<v 0>so I prepared a few questions.</v>

333
00:24:07.820 --> 00:24:10.530
You would of course love to have your questions to

334
00:24:12.420 --> 00:24:14.100
see if we can control the camera.

335
00:24:20.800 --> 00:24:24.250
<v 1>I'll start with a couple of mine since I haven't</v>

336
00:24:24.390 --> 00:24:27.310
<v 0>a little time to think in advance about them.
Um,</v>

337
00:24:27.780 --> 00:24:32.160
and you know,
if anyone does want to ask a question,

338
00:24:32.610 --> 00:24:33.600
just,
uh,

339
00:24:35.400 --> 00:24:38.700
feel free to jump in.
I,
I guess,

340
00:24:38.701 --> 00:24:43.650
I mean you talked a lot about gender and you're talking,
I mentioned earlier the

341
00:24:45.360 --> 00:24:50.360
how we do I guess tend to forget about the role of women in computing in the

342
00:24:52.860 --> 00:24:55.940
60s.
So for example,
uh,
my advisor,
uh,

343
00:24:56.010 --> 00:24:59.540
got his start working on cts ass and then went on to work on Baltics.

344
00:24:59.541 --> 00:25:00.900
And so I've read a bunch of those papers,

345
00:25:00.901 --> 00:25:03.780
but it actually wasn't until I read your book,
did I realize that?

346
00:25:03.840 --> 00:25:07.740
I think the second author on the CCSS paper was a woman,
Marjorie.

347
00:25:08.010 --> 00:25:12.090
Everyone used initials back then,
so I only ever recognized her by her last name.

348
00:25:12.450 --> 00:25:17.240
Right.
And uh,
and so yeah,
that was a little invisible to me.
Um,

349
00:25:17.670 --> 00:25:20.130
so you talk about how it's connected to people.

350
00:25:20.650 --> 00:25:25.650
I feel sometimes like a society and culture has moved farther ahead than maybe

351
00:25:26.821 --> 00:25:29.390
computing has,
right?
So we have,
uh,

352
00:25:29.880 --> 00:25:34.880
I think more problems with equity like in the industry than we do in society at

353
00:25:35.550 --> 00:25:40.020
large.
Like I wonder if you think that's fair or you know,

354
00:25:40.110 --> 00:25:41.850
if there's a reason for that,
right.

355
00:25:41.880 --> 00:25:45.990
Is this somehow competing didn't keep up with the rest of society usually we

356
00:25:45.991 --> 00:25:48.300
think of competing being ahead.
Right?

357
00:25:48.620 --> 00:25:53.540
<v 4>Yeah.
I see.
I actually,
I feel like what I'm about to say sounds pessimistic,</v>

358
00:25:53.541 --> 00:25:55.160
but I think right now at this moment,

359
00:25:55.161 --> 00:25:59.180
in some ways in this cultural moment society,
um,

360
00:25:59.181 --> 00:26:03.710
is maybe about where sort of technology is,
um,

361
00:26:03.770 --> 00:26:07.670
and that they're inseparable.

362
00:26:07.730 --> 00:26:12.730
I was listening to a podcast the other day and one of the speakers said that in

363
00:26:13.311 --> 00:26:17.810
technology and stem more broadly,
there's not a pipeline problem.

364
00:26:17.840 --> 00:26:22.040
It's not about getting women in because there have always been women doing

365
00:26:22.041 --> 00:26:25.820
science and technology and computing.
It's a gender problem.

366
00:26:25.850 --> 00:26:30.850
It's sort of how we think about what is normal and expected of men of women,

367
00:26:32.750 --> 00:26:35.960
not just in culture broadly but in particular cases.

368
00:26:35.961 --> 00:26:40.910
Part of why I love the Dartmouth case is because you really see this creation

369
00:26:40.911 --> 00:26:44.730
of,
of masculine around football,

370
00:26:44.731 --> 00:26:49.731
around playing computing pranks around the fact that there are women working in

371
00:26:50.160 --> 00:26:55.160
all sorts of ways in tech and still the college president is talking about like

372
00:26:55.831 --> 00:27:00.570
women doing their grocery shopping.
So I think there's work to be done,

373
00:27:00.990 --> 00:27:01.823
um,

374
00:27:01.980 --> 00:27:06.980
in tech and in society and really thinking about the kinds of cultures

375
00:27:09.460 --> 00:27:10.630
or micro cultures,

376
00:27:10.631 --> 00:27:15.631
maybe corporate cultures and how they both mirror what's happening in society as

377
00:27:16.331 --> 00:27:21.331
well as how they might be a room to sort of steer and shift changes in society

378
00:27:22.751 --> 00:27:23.584
as well.

379
00:27:26.130 --> 00:27:29.190
<v 5>Maybe also mention as set up to</v>

380
00:27:29.510 --> 00:27:33.830
<v 0>this question,
um,
the book talks about more than Dartmouth and basic,</v>

381
00:27:34.690 --> 00:27:34.991
you know,

382
00:27:34.991 --> 00:27:39.110
and I thought that was really fascinating to see sort of the range of early

383
00:27:39.111 --> 00:27:42.050
computer networks and what they were like.
So there was a,
um,

384
00:27:42.290 --> 00:27:46.070
there's this great network at Illinois built around a computer with like a

385
00:27:46.071 --> 00:27:48.240
plasma display in a touch screen.
Yeah.

386
00:27:48.760 --> 00:27:49.593
<v 5>MMM.</v>

387
00:27:49.990 --> 00:27:54.500
<v 0>You know,
which is 75.
Right?
Yeah.
Which was really impressive.
And um,</v>

388
00:27:54.740 --> 00:27:56.170
and a network of,

389
00:27:56.300 --> 00:27:57.780
<v 5>uh,
uh,</v>

390
00:27:58.130 --> 00:28:02.570
<v 0>Minnesota that was,
uh,
run by the state for all the schools in the state.</v>

391
00:28:02.970 --> 00:28:05.040
<v 5>Um,
and</v>

392
00:28:07.310 --> 00:28:12.050
<v 0>I guess I was curious to what extent did you explore,</v>

393
00:28:12.051 --> 00:28:15.440
or how maybe the gender roles were different in some of those places.

394
00:28:15.441 --> 00:28:18.080
I know when you talk about Illinois in the book,

395
00:28:18.150 --> 00:28:22.880
the one example of use of sort of the teaching software that's developed was a

396
00:28:23.000 --> 00:28:27.080
woman developing coursework for nursing students.

397
00:28:27.320 --> 00:28:31.100
I guess she happened to be the husband of the crater or the partner or the

398
00:28:31.101 --> 00:28:31.970
creator of the system.

399
00:28:31.971 --> 00:28:35.750
But was that different by virtue of the nature of what it was used for and the

400
00:28:35.751 --> 00:28:38.750
student population or,
or not?

401
00:28:39.280 --> 00:28:44.280
<v 4>I think it's the same sort of unusual juxtaposition of the fact that,</v>

402
00:28:44.441 --> 00:28:47.770
so this network,
uh,
centered at the University of Illinois,

403
00:28:47.771 --> 00:28:50.080
he called Plato is originally,

404
00:28:50.081 --> 00:28:52.810
it starts as a network that's focused on education,

405
00:28:52.811 --> 00:28:55.990
like computer assisted instruction.
Um,

406
00:28:56.050 --> 00:29:00.690
and so in trying to develop this system,
they're working with,
uh,

407
00:29:00.850 --> 00:29:05.170
men and women experts from all sorts of different fields.
And as a result,

408
00:29:05.171 --> 00:29:09.940
you end up with people like Marianne Bitzer who is creating nursing education

409
00:29:09.941 --> 00:29:14.890
for our students.
But as a result also becoming,
she's doing technological work.

410
00:29:15.250 --> 00:29:17.470
Uh,
there's another woman,
Valerie Lamont,

411
00:29:17.500 --> 00:29:22.500
who actually creates a program that's related to environmental pollution and

412
00:29:22.751 --> 00:29:26.110
Urbana Champagne.
And again,
she's a political scientist,

413
00:29:26.140 --> 00:29:30.180
but doing this technological communicative work.
Um,

414
00:29:31.450 --> 00:29:35.140
and so I think what we see with Plato and I talk about this a bit in the book,

415
00:29:35.141 --> 00:29:39.520
is that there's a space for these women to sort of do things that,

416
00:29:40.120 --> 00:29:43.180
that are defined the sort of cultural norm.

417
00:29:43.600 --> 00:29:45.250
But at the same time,

418
00:29:45.340 --> 00:29:50.340
the network itself and the way that it's spoken about more broadly in society

419
00:29:50.801 --> 00:29:54.550
sort of does things like reinforce gender norms.

420
00:29:54.551 --> 00:29:57.820
So for instance,
there,
it's an amazing resource.

421
00:29:57.821 --> 00:30:00.640
There are four years of their notes files,

422
00:30:00.641 --> 00:30:04.480
which were like their digital bulletin board and they preserved them.

423
00:30:04.720 --> 00:30:08.440
And you can go online and sort of read through four years of people's

424
00:30:08.441 --> 00:30:10.900
interactions on a message board.

425
00:30:11.440 --> 00:30:15.760
And those clearly show sort of women complaining about harassment,

426
00:30:15.761 --> 00:30:18.340
like women who are working on the system,
who are experts,

427
00:30:18.341 --> 00:30:21.640
they're treated differently than the men.
So it's this,

428
00:30:21.670 --> 00:30:24.430
it's this push and pull this tension of,
ah,

429
00:30:24.431 --> 00:30:28.090
we've got a space for women,
um,

430
00:30:28.990 --> 00:30:33.190
to do the technological work,
but it's not recognized.

431
00:30:33.191 --> 00:30:37.860
And they're often because of the culture sort of not even sort of,

432
00:30:37.870 --> 00:30:41.680
they are,
they're harassed,
they're marginalized,
they're not recognized.

433
00:30:42.330 --> 00:30:42.571
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

434
00:30:42.571 --> 00:30:47.571
I guess the kind of mix of aggressions and microaggressions.

435
00:30:47.611 --> 00:30:49.190
I,
you know,
that I,
you know,

436
00:30:49.260 --> 00:30:54.180
I know my colleagues here face when we're developing software today.

437
00:30:54.181 --> 00:30:56.020
So I guess yeah,

438
00:30:56.550 --> 00:31:01.550
it turned out to be a little sad that like the same sort of gender stereotypes

439
00:31:03.211 --> 00:31:07.650
continued to play out today.
You know,
I think we,
we,
we have more awareness today,

440
00:31:07.680 --> 00:31:08.880
so maybe we can do better,

441
00:31:09.210 --> 00:31:11.310
but I don't know that we're actually doing a lot better yet.

442
00:31:11.560 --> 00:31:13.530
<v 4>Yeah.
And it mean to,
you know,
today,
I think it,</v>

443
00:31:13.531 --> 00:31:17.330
it sort of plays out in right in media representations of,

444
00:31:17.331 --> 00:31:21.170
and I talk about this a bit in my book was sort of Silicon Valley mythology or

445
00:31:21.180 --> 00:31:26.030
the sort of idea that like all technology is created by like a few white guys

446
00:31:26.270 --> 00:31:28.790
and everyone in this room,

447
00:31:28.791 --> 00:31:31.850
I'm sure everyone at Google knows that's not the case.

448
00:31:31.851 --> 00:31:35.870
You're all like living and breathing,
um,
evidence of that,

449
00:31:35.900 --> 00:31:39.680
but still sort of,
I think in media coverage,

450
00:31:40.220 --> 00:31:41.870
popular culture,
it's a,

451
00:31:41.871 --> 00:31:46.730
it's a still a different idea and it's one that kind of privileges,
you know,

452
00:31:46.731 --> 00:31:47.750
Pale males.

453
00:31:48.880 --> 00:31:53.180
<v 0>Yeah.
Yeah.
Um,
I also wanted to ask,
uh,</v>

454
00:31:53.580 --> 00:31:58.580
a little bit about this notion of computing citizenship that you talk about.

455
00:31:59.640 --> 00:32:02.370
Uh,
which I thought was pretty interesting and,

456
00:32:02.600 --> 00:32:05.850
and played out in all of the places that,
um,
uh,

457
00:32:05.880 --> 00:32:09.100
I guess at Dartmouth it was about being a good user,
right?
And you know,

458
00:32:09.240 --> 00:32:12.900
sharing things but not using too much space for your programs that were not

459
00:32:12.901 --> 00:32:14.240
worth sharing.
Uh,

460
00:32:14.310 --> 00:32:19.310
and you sort of contrast that with the citizenship and community with sort of a

461
00:32:20.251 --> 00:32:23.760
consumer culture maybe that came with the PC.

462
00:32:23.761 --> 00:32:25.980
Right now we want to sell a PC into your home.

463
00:32:26.130 --> 00:32:29.070
It's a thing you buy and it comes with software on it,

464
00:32:29.100 --> 00:32:31.830
but it doesn't have the same sharing.
I mean,

465
00:32:31.860 --> 00:32:33.390
maybe you could say a little bit more about that.

466
00:32:33.850 --> 00:32:37.350
<v 4>Ah,
so when I was on the journey of researching and writing this book,</v>

467
00:32:37.380 --> 00:32:41.420
I really sort of thinking from user up for a while I struggled because I was

468
00:32:41.421 --> 00:32:45.290
like,
oh,
very clearly,
very quickly it became clear to me like,

469
00:32:45.291 --> 00:32:48.620
these aren't just users.
They are,
they're writing software,

470
00:32:48.621 --> 00:32:52.160
they're creating games,
they're figuring out how to do social networking.

471
00:32:52.161 --> 00:32:54.890
In the 1960s and I debated like,

472
00:32:54.950 --> 00:32:57.710
am I going to call them authors?
You know,

473
00:32:57.711 --> 00:33:01.670
they're writing or coding or they programmers are they makers?

474
00:33:01.671 --> 00:33:03.320
And none of that seemed right.

475
00:33:03.980 --> 00:33:08.000
And over the course of my writing I realized,
well,

476
00:33:08.001 --> 00:33:13.001
what's essential is they're all part of these communities and those community

477
00:33:13.370 --> 00:33:14.203
there,

478
00:33:14.690 --> 00:33:19.690
they're focused on collaboration and sort of at their most ideal,

479
00:33:19.911 --> 00:33:23.900
there is this idea of computing for the public good computing as a collective

480
00:33:23.901 --> 00:33:24.734
resource.

481
00:33:25.100 --> 00:33:30.100
And so I thought of the idea of competing citizenship as a way to say they are

482
00:33:31.191 --> 00:33:33.980
citizens of these computing communities.

483
00:33:34.010 --> 00:33:39.010
They are participating and it's not a political scientist idea of Def,

484
00:33:39.680 --> 00:33:41.330
uh,
idea of citizenship.

485
00:33:41.360 --> 00:33:46.360
Although in some ways they're closely related in terms of who is recognized to,

486
00:33:46.461 --> 00:33:48.650
is supported,
um,

487
00:33:48.890 --> 00:33:51.830
who gets a voice in the network and on the network.

488
00:33:52.310 --> 00:33:56.900
And so when I started thinking about citizenship as a way to talk about their

489
00:33:56.901 --> 00:33:57.890
participation,

490
00:33:58.130 --> 00:34:03.130
and also I should say to emphasize all of the public institutions that

491
00:34:03.560 --> 00:34:06.500
underwrote all of this networking right there,

492
00:34:06.650 --> 00:34:08.840
local and state and federal governments,

493
00:34:08.841 --> 00:34:13.010
the National Science Foundation colleges and public universities,

494
00:34:13.011 --> 00:34:16.840
they're all pouring money into these computing that works.

495
00:34:16.841 --> 00:34:21.620
So here's another way that sort of citizenship comes into play.
Well

496
00:34:23.780 --> 00:34:28.670
over the course of the 1980s and really with the introduction of personal

497
00:34:28.671 --> 00:34:33.440
computers or hung computers,
there's no more as there is this idea of like,
oh,

498
00:34:33.441 --> 00:34:36.230
computing might be something we have as a public utility,

499
00:34:36.290 --> 00:34:40.490
which there was very much this idea that like there was gonna be a public

500
00:34:40.491 --> 00:34:45.491
competing utility in the 1960s or seventies and instead it became this idea of

501
00:34:45.621 --> 00:34:49.040
know everyone's going to go out and they're going to buy a computer,

502
00:34:49.041 --> 00:34:51.710
they're going to buy a device,
they're going to buy software.

503
00:34:51.710 --> 00:34:55.250
Whereas in the sixties and seventies the communities I'm talking about are

504
00:34:55.251 --> 00:34:58.430
saying,
no,
no.
We share our son.
We share our basic,

505
00:34:58.431 --> 00:35:02.180
like basic is freely available to whoever wants it.

506
00:35:02.510 --> 00:35:07.250
We publish basic programs,
we circulate them.
And so to me,

507
00:35:07.251 --> 00:35:09.770
I saw it's sort of,

508
00:35:09.771 --> 00:35:14.630
it's a foreclosure of opportunity to this shift from saying our computing could

509
00:35:14.631 --> 00:35:17.390
be for the public good.
It could be a public utility,

510
00:35:17.780 --> 00:35:20.500
it could be regulated by the government,
um,

511
00:35:20.720 --> 00:35:24.620
for better or perhaps for worse to this idea of no,
no,

512
00:35:24.621 --> 00:35:27.740
everyone should go by,
by a computer,
by device,

513
00:35:27.741 --> 00:35:31.940
by some software that limits things.
It certainly

514
00:35:33.620 --> 00:35:37.790
makes the distribution of computing less equal.
Right?
Because you,

515
00:35:38.110 --> 00:35:41.520
<v 0>you,
you know,
you need to have the affluence to afford to go buy a computer.</v>

516
00:35:41.521 --> 00:35:44.790
Right.
And,
and if you want to connect to someone else,

517
00:35:44.791 --> 00:35:48.000
you have to pay yourself a,
for the network access.
I was,

518
00:35:48.270 --> 00:35:53.010
I was struck by how expensive it was,
uh,
to be part of a network.

519
00:35:53.011 --> 00:35:55.950
And that was actually mostly telephone charges.
And,

520
00:35:56.000 --> 00:35:59.370
and you talked about how the state of Minnesota like pooled its resources and

521
00:35:59.371 --> 00:36:03.510
they were able to negotiate with the telephone company for better rates and

522
00:36:03.511 --> 00:36:05.580
better tech knowledgey.
Yeah.

523
00:36:05.840 --> 00:36:09.170
<v 4>And I,
I mean,
I love,
I love the Minnesota case.</v>

524
00:36:09.171 --> 00:36:13.100
So Minnesota has a statewide computing network and that's built sort of between

525
00:36:13.101 --> 00:36:18.101
1965 and 1975 and they're very explicit in saying,

526
00:36:18.321 --> 00:36:19.970
we're going to build this as,

527
00:36:20.060 --> 00:36:24.560
as a public institutions to provide a quality of access,

528
00:36:24.980 --> 00:36:29.960
not just for people in the twin cities suburbs,
but for people in rural areas,

529
00:36:29.961 --> 00:36:34.961
for students who are in less affluent areas and they use their weight as the

530
00:36:36.471 --> 00:36:39.710
state government to do things like negotiate better,

531
00:36:40.030 --> 00:36:44.990
fall in line rates and negotiate lower costs so that it really does become a

532
00:36:44.991 --> 00:36:49.400
public good.
Yeah.
So
hmm.

533
00:36:49.600 --> 00:36:54.040
<v 0>Networking is more widely available today.
Yes.</v>

534
00:36:54.550 --> 00:36:58.120
Uh,
and the cost of the devices is lower,

535
00:36:58.121 --> 00:37:00.670
although a high end,
you know,

536
00:37:00.730 --> 00:37:04.900
smartphone is probably $1,000 these days.
So it's still not very,

537
00:37:05.200 --> 00:37:09.070
uh,
uh,
equal access.
But I mean,

538
00:37:09.071 --> 00:37:13.780
do you think that notion of citizenship still is one we should be thinking about

539
00:37:13.781 --> 00:37:18.510
today?
I mean,
right now you are a consumer of like social networking apps and,

540
00:37:18.580 --> 00:37:22.030
and you don't have a whole lot of control over it.
Right.

541
00:37:22.360 --> 00:37:25.740
Would it be better if there were more programmers a citizen?
Yeah,

542
00:37:26.030 --> 00:37:26.910
<v 4>absolutely.</v>

543
00:37:26.930 --> 00:37:31.930
Think citizenship is something we should be thinking about precisely because we

544
00:37:32.241 --> 00:37:33.830
are consumers.
I mean,

545
00:37:33.831 --> 00:37:37.640
so much of the social media that we consume are,

546
00:37:37.641 --> 00:37:42.641
so many of the apps are made by corporations that are out to make money,

547
00:37:43.550 --> 00:37:45.980
not out to do the public good.

548
00:37:45.981 --> 00:37:49.940
And those aren't necessarily mutually exclusive.

549
00:37:49.941 --> 00:37:54.941
But it's a reminder that if you have a company that is looking after its bottom

550
00:37:56.121 --> 00:37:58.520
line,
that's the bottom line.

551
00:37:58.700 --> 00:38:03.700
Not the people who are using the apps are using the platform or whatever it is.

552
00:38:06.290 --> 00:38:11.290
So I absolutely think competing citizenship is relevant to sort of reimagine

553
00:38:14.210 --> 00:38:19.210
where do we want are very much digital networked world to go,

554
00:38:19.790 --> 00:38:20.240
what,

555
00:38:20.240 --> 00:38:25.240
what would the conversations around what we hope look like and how can the past

556
00:38:26.781 --> 00:38:31.220
inform us sort of in what we might want to change and what we really liked about

557
00:38:31.460 --> 00:38:36.100
what things look like in the 1960s in 1970s.
Yeah,

558
00:38:36.100 --> 00:38:37.300
<v 0>I tried to think what,</v>

559
00:38:37.420 --> 00:38:41.470
what version of programming is available to kids today?

560
00:38:41.550 --> 00:38:43.790
And I'm wondering like it,

561
00:38:43.990 --> 00:38:48.490
Minecraft is probably the closest they get to creating things,
right?
I don't,

562
00:38:48.700 --> 00:38:51.130
I don't know how widespread otherwise,
uh,

563
00:38:51.220 --> 00:38:55.060
for kids actual creating of things is

564
00:38:56.300 --> 00:39:00.380
<v 4>there.
I mean I think there are,
there are some pushes and</v>

565
00:39:01.940 --> 00:39:06.500
to sort of get kids back into coding and programming and,
yeah.

566
00:39:06.920 --> 00:39:11.480
But I think too with anything like that,
there's still the same caution of like,

567
00:39:11.570 --> 00:39:12.260
well how,

568
00:39:12.260 --> 00:39:17.260
how are sort of societal expectations around do we encourage the boys more than

569
00:39:18.621 --> 00:39:22.850
the girls are sort of how these things play out.
Right.
At the same time.

570
00:39:23.050 --> 00:39:24.460
<v 0>Yeah.
Um,</v>

571
00:39:24.910 --> 00:39:29.170
I had one more question I thought I would ask and then try to open it up to

572
00:39:29.470 --> 00:39:30.370
audience questions.

573
00:39:30.490 --> 00:39:34.840
So you talked about a lot of different sort of early computing networks and

574
00:39:34.841 --> 00:39:36.660
systems and users and it,

575
00:39:36.730 --> 00:39:39.670
and it seemed like you had a call at the end of the book that,
uh,

576
00:39:39.940 --> 00:39:43.630
your list is not exhaustive,
right?
It's not like you hit,
like,

577
00:39:43.631 --> 00:39:47.710
do you have other areas that you've heard about or you think that would be

578
00:39:47.711 --> 00:39:50.080
really interesting for someone to investigate more?

579
00:39:50.160 --> 00:39:54.780
<v 4>Yes,
yes.
So other people,
other historians,</v>

580
00:39:54.781 --> 00:39:58.740
other communications and media scholars,
whoever.
Um,

581
00:39:59.310 --> 00:40:04.310
my book basically ends right around 1980 and I think the sort of the 1980s into

582
00:40:06.211 --> 00:40:09.690
the early nineties is another rich,
amazing time to say like,

583
00:40:09.691 --> 00:40:13.500
all these people were buying personal computers and there were so many computers

584
00:40:13.501 --> 00:40:17.760
in schools.
Like if we wrote those histories from me user up,

585
00:40:18.120 --> 00:40:21.450
what would they look like?
Similarly?
Um,

586
00:40:22.290 --> 00:40:24.390
we know a bit about the,

587
00:40:24.391 --> 00:40:29.391
well while there was a New York City version of that called Echo east coast

588
00:40:29.731 --> 00:40:30.564
hangout,

589
00:40:30.810 --> 00:40:35.810
which was a huge online bulletin board system during the eighties and nineties.

590
00:40:37.291 --> 00:40:41.190
Another great source to look at like what,
what's happening,

591
00:40:41.191 --> 00:40:44.790
sort of what is as more people are networked,

592
00:40:44.791 --> 00:40:49.680
what does that look like?
Um,
yeah,

593
00:40:49.950 --> 00:40:50.611
there's a whole,

594
00:40:50.611 --> 00:40:54.450
I think a whole world in a whole case of the eighties and early nineties and not

595
00:40:54.451 --> 00:40:58.110
just in the United States.
This is the other thing that I am excited about.

596
00:40:58.111 --> 00:40:59.880
Some of my colleagues are writing right now,

597
00:40:59.881 --> 00:41:04.881
histories of networks in the Soviet Union or networks in China,

598
00:41:05.400 --> 00:41:06.450
these kinds of things.

599
00:41:06.451 --> 00:41:10.680
And I think all of those are important to help us understand that the United

600
00:41:10.680 --> 00:41:15.090
States isn't necessarily,
um,
the isolated,
unparalleled case.

601
00:41:15.091 --> 00:41:17.580
But what are the similarities and differences?

602
00:41:18.100 --> 00:41:23.050
<v 0>Yeah.
All right,
thanks.
So,
um,
anyone else want to ask some questions?</v>

603
00:41:23.051 --> 00:41:23.884
We can.

604
00:41:31.530 --> 00:41:33.090
Hi.
Uh,
thank you for your talk.

605
00:41:33.650 --> 00:41:36.920
I was wondering if you could talk a little bit more about where this particular

606
00:41:36.921 --> 00:41:41.360
work like fits into your professional interest or your personal story or like

607
00:41:41.361 --> 00:41:44.530
sort of how you came to be,
uh,
to,

608
00:41:44.560 --> 00:41:47.990
to want to write this book and put the,
put these things together.
Right.

609
00:41:48.320 --> 00:41:50.030
<v 4>Yeah,
I love that question.</v>

610
00:41:50.031 --> 00:41:54.410
So I was actually telling Jeremy this a little bit before.
Um,

611
00:41:54.500 --> 00:41:59.300
I am maybe an atypical historian and that I was a math major at Dartmouth.

612
00:41:59.301 --> 00:42:04.301
I was also a history major and after college I worked for a must a decade,

613
00:42:05.270 --> 00:42:05.630
uh,

614
00:42:05.630 --> 00:42:10.630
at companies that involved technology and education or launching programs that

615
00:42:11.991 --> 00:42:16.730
had to do with education and technology.
And every single time,

616
00:42:16.760 --> 00:42:20.690
every single place we sort of roll something out and watch what,
you know,

617
00:42:20.691 --> 00:42:23.150
we called them the users,
like what are they going to do?

618
00:42:23.240 --> 00:42:25.610
And it was never what we expected.

619
00:42:25.611 --> 00:42:30.020
And it was always creative and surprising and sometimes infuriating.

620
00:42:31.220 --> 00:42:35.090
But it was something that at the time I was like,
this is,

621
00:42:35.180 --> 00:42:37.580
this is not at all what I expected.
Uh,

622
00:42:37.610 --> 00:42:42.610
people are doing things very differently in an amazing social often social ways

623
00:42:43.100 --> 00:42:47.150
that we hadn't planned on.
Um,

624
00:42:49.100 --> 00:42:54.100
and so when I finally sort of my path meandered and I said,

625
00:42:54.410 --> 00:42:57.410
it's time for me to go to Grad school.
You're going to pay me to do this,

626
00:42:57.411 --> 00:43:00.110
to read and write.
Yes,
please sign me up.

627
00:43:00.530 --> 00:43:05.530
And I studied the history of science and technology and when it came time to

628
00:43:05.661 --> 00:43:07.790
pick a project or look for our project,

629
00:43:07.791 --> 00:43:10.850
I was reminded that as an undergraduate at Dartmouth,

630
00:43:10.851 --> 00:43:13.790
I was an Undergrad at Dartmouth in the nineties we had this vibrant,

631
00:43:13.791 --> 00:43:17.720
competing culture of email.
I never picked up the phone.

632
00:43:17.930 --> 00:43:21.260
I had other friends who were like,
what's email?
And I was like,
email is great.

633
00:43:21.290 --> 00:43:26.210
Like,
I mean,
right.
How can I tell you what email is if you don't know?
Um,

634
00:43:26.960 --> 00:43:29.450
and I remembered sort of from being there,

635
00:43:29.451 --> 00:43:31.700
I knew that Dartmouth had more of a history.

636
00:43:31.701 --> 00:43:36.140
So that was sort of the first place that I started when I said I think I want to

637
00:43:36.141 --> 00:43:38.390
write a very different history than most,

638
00:43:38.750 --> 00:43:41.030
even within among professional historians,

639
00:43:41.031 --> 00:43:44.510
most computing histories are very much like men and machines.

640
00:43:44.810 --> 00:43:48.290
And that's changing recently but it wasn't the history of that.

641
00:43:48.291 --> 00:43:52.130
I wanted to write.
And the final,
the third thing,

642
00:43:52.131 --> 00:43:55.160
and I sort of recommend everyone,
like go check this out.

643
00:43:55.161 --> 00:43:57.380
There's a great book called Computer Lib.

644
00:43:57.500 --> 00:44:01.970
You can and must understand computers now written by Ted Nelson.

645
00:44:01.971 --> 00:44:06.971
I think he self publishes it in 1974 and in the first few pages of that book,

646
00:44:08.510 --> 00:44:09.380
he has a map.

647
00:44:09.560 --> 00:44:13.640
It's a hand drawn map and it's like where it's at computing USA.

648
00:44:14.420 --> 00:44:16.850
And I looked at that map and yeah,

649
00:44:16.851 --> 00:44:19.490
there's Mit and the like one 28 area.

650
00:44:19.491 --> 00:44:23.300
And of course there's like the bay area and a few other places that I knew.

651
00:44:23.301 --> 00:44:27.890
But then I saw Dartmouth and I thought how high that we're onto something here.

652
00:44:27.950 --> 00:44:31.040
And I saw a Minnesota,
uh,
and I saw,

653
00:44:31.710 --> 00:44:34.960
and those were sort of points for me to say what's going on.

654
00:44:35.070 --> 00:44:37.380
<v 1>Fair.
Yeah.</v>

655
00:44:40.840 --> 00:44:45.840
<v 6>So say you had some really interesting looks back at history and how gender and</v>

656
00:44:47.281 --> 00:44:50.940
computing into played,
uh,
and you touched on it a little bit,

657
00:44:50.941 --> 00:44:54.880
but I was curious if you had more information about how race and computing in

658
00:44:54.881 --> 00:44:57.210
the plate back then and how that's changed over time.

659
00:44:57.960 --> 00:44:58.793
<v 4>Thank you.
That's a,</v>

660
00:44:58.860 --> 00:45:02.370
that's a great question and it's something I talk a little bit about in the book

661
00:45:02.371 --> 00:45:06.690
is,
for example,
and I'll use the Dartmouth case again.
So at this time,

662
00:45:06.691 --> 00:45:09.300
Dartmouth in the early sixties,

663
00:45:09.301 --> 00:45:14.301
Dartmouth has almost exclusively white students and by the end of the 1960s,

664
00:45:15.630 --> 00:45:17.340
as Kennedy becomes president,

665
00:45:17.341 --> 00:45:21.570
they're working hard to actively sort of recruit and diversify,

666
00:45:22.080 --> 00:45:26.130
um,
native American students as well as black students.

667
00:45:26.610 --> 00:45:29.280
And there's this moment in time,

668
00:45:29.550 --> 00:45:33.030
whereas all of these students are coming in,

669
00:45:33.210 --> 00:45:38.100
you can see in the newsletter that they're giving to all the first year
students.

670
00:45:38.130 --> 00:45:43.130
They're promoting a sort of homegrown programs about race that had been

671
00:45:43.981 --> 00:45:48.981
developed to sort of combat racism and to really sort of make people aware of

672
00:45:51.510 --> 00:45:53.820
some of the problems with racism.

673
00:45:54.510 --> 00:45:57.810
But those programs which had been developed in anthropology,

674
00:45:57.930 --> 00:46:00.480
they sort of came with warnings that said like,
oh,

675
00:46:00.481 --> 00:46:05.481
we don't recommend the use of these programs outside of classes for advanced

676
00:46:06.181 --> 00:46:11.181
undergraduates because they could be misunderstood if used the wrong way.

677
00:46:11.640 --> 00:46:14.490
And meanwhile the computing center is like,
Hey,

678
00:46:14.491 --> 00:46:17.580
all you first years check out these programs.

679
00:46:17.581 --> 00:46:22.581
And there I think with all good intentions inadvertently Rayanne scribing the

680
00:46:23.011 --> 00:46:28.011
racism as well as calling attention to the otherness of all of those students

681
00:46:28.561 --> 00:46:32.580
who aren't white men.
And,
and really,
and this,

682
00:46:32.640 --> 00:46:37.640
this also sort of needs to be emphasized doing work of saying,

683
00:46:37.800 --> 00:46:40.970
oh well computing is something we are racist.

684
00:46:41.020 --> 00:46:43.500
Something we can study with computing,

685
00:46:43.930 --> 00:46:48.930
therefore it's separate from computing or it seems separate from computing when

686
00:46:49.621 --> 00:46:54.621
we know that's not the case when race just as much as gender is part of the

687
00:46:55.171 --> 00:46:57.000
social world of technology.

688
00:47:05.570 --> 00:47:08.230
<v 6>It's not a question,
but it's a little bit of optimism.
Um,</v>

689
00:47:08.760 --> 00:47:13.760
but one of my markers for the relationship between technology and society is

690
00:47:14.780 --> 00:47:19.610
something that I learned from Google.
Uh,
if you do an image search for scientist,

691
00:47:20.000 --> 00:47:23.900
even up to a year ago,
it was all pale males and I just did it just now.

692
00:47:23.960 --> 00:47:25.880
I break my role about opening my laptop's in a,

693
00:47:25.881 --> 00:47:28.310
in a meeting and I checked and it's much better now.

694
00:47:28.370 --> 00:47:30.190
So there's a positive note there.

695
00:47:30.210 --> 00:47:34.210
Someone's working on it and the power of a Google image search to impact

696
00:47:34.211 --> 00:47:39.010
people's view of a field.
It's very important.
And uh,
so there's some,

697
00:47:39.620 --> 00:47:40.340
was a happy note.

698
00:47:40.340 --> 00:47:44.740
<v 4>Yeah,
no,
there is a happy now and I mean it's sort of,
it's like cuts both ways,</v>

699
00:47:44.741 --> 00:47:44.891
right?

700
00:47:44.891 --> 00:47:48.550
And it's the artificial intelligence and machine learning saying if you asked

701
00:47:48.551 --> 00:47:50.890
for a picture of a doctor,
you get up man.

702
00:47:50.891 --> 00:47:52.930
And if you asked for a picture of a nurse,
you get a woman.

703
00:47:52.931 --> 00:47:57.931
But as my colleagues and I and people here call attention to those things and

704
00:47:58.451 --> 00:48:00.440
sort of increasingly become aware of the,

705
00:48:00.550 --> 00:48:04.780
the responsibility that needs to be inherent.
And like I said,

706
00:48:04.781 --> 00:48:06.460
the fact that tech isn't separate.

707
00:48:06.461 --> 00:48:11.320
Like you're always doing what you do with people in mind and to be more mindful

708
00:48:11.321 --> 00:48:16.180
of who those people are,
if you know it can make a difference.

709
00:48:16.880 --> 00:48:19.580
<v 1>Yeah.
Baby steps.
Yes.</v>

710
00:48:26.890 --> 00:48:30.000
<v 6>Uh,
I thought it was interesting you brought up,
um,</v>

711
00:48:30.290 --> 00:48:35.290
the fixation on pipeline today as I would call it a scapegoat,

712
00:48:35.930 --> 00:48:39.200
um,
from actually,
you know,
actually doing some,
uh,

713
00:48:39.440 --> 00:48:41.900
something about inclusivity with the people who are already in the pipeline or

714
00:48:41.901 --> 00:48:43.580
something like that.
Um,

715
00:48:44.000 --> 00:48:48.080
and it strikes me that that's not an excuse you can use an early computing.

716
00:48:48.590 --> 00:48:51.860
Uh,
do you find that there were

717
00:48:54.190 --> 00:48:58.960
similar scapegoat type arguments,
um,
in early computing that,

718
00:48:59.610 --> 00:48:59.980
um,

719
00:48:59.980 --> 00:49:04.980
limited a diversity and inclusion or was it more direct and stereotyped in the

720
00:49:06.611 --> 00:49:07.444
ways that you,

721
00:49:07.920 --> 00:49:08.551
<v 4>so I'm going to,</v>

722
00:49:08.551 --> 00:49:12.480
I'm going to summarize a lot of history here and the work of my colleagues to

723
00:49:12.481 --> 00:49:12.841
say,

724
00:49:12.841 --> 00:49:17.841
so computers used to be a word that meant people computer,

725
00:49:17.970 --> 00:49:22.170
Pre World War II computers referred to people who did mathematical or with

726
00:49:22.171 --> 00:49:26.550
Matech computations.
Um,
and those people were most often women.

727
00:49:27.330 --> 00:49:32.010
And when computing,
certainly in the United States as well as Great Britain,

728
00:49:32.130 --> 00:49:37.050
sort of when computing became in the,
we'll say sort of world war one,

729
00:49:37.051 --> 00:49:40.650
World War Two era,
the work of business administration,

730
00:49:40.651 --> 00:49:45.651
office machines and people doing computing at that time were most often women.

731
00:49:46.770 --> 00:49:51.770
And it's why in some ways it's not surprising that there are so many women doing

732
00:49:51.871 --> 00:49:56.490
computing in the United States during the 1950 [inaudible] and 1960 is what

733
00:49:56.491 --> 00:50:01.491
we've seen happen is that as it was increasingly clear that computers would be

734
00:50:03.721 --> 00:50:07.170
crucial to society and valuable work,

735
00:50:09.500 --> 00:50:14.500
sort of multiple processes happen whereby women were pushed out because the work

736
00:50:15.381 --> 00:50:20.381
became more PR work seen as more prestigious and therefore as computing

737
00:50:20.901 --> 00:50:25.160
professionalize became a more masculine field.

738
00:50:25.161 --> 00:50:30.161
So sort of aptitude tests were given programmers that really emphasize masculine

739
00:50:30.291 --> 00:50:32.670
male characteristics for instance.
Yeah.

740
00:50:32.860 --> 00:50:34.780
<v 1>Um,
so</v>

741
00:50:37.120 --> 00:50:38.800
it wasn't sort of,

742
00:50:39.420 --> 00:50:44.420
<v 4>in some ways it was like a reverse of inclusivity where the women were over time</v>

743
00:50:45.570 --> 00:50:50.570
pushed out and the cultures around technology became more masculine and ways

744
00:50:50.911 --> 00:50:55.230
that it was harder for them to be in that work.
In that world.

745
00:50:57.960 --> 00:51:00.450
We have time for one more question if there is one.

746
00:51:00.760 --> 00:51:01.593
<v 1>Hmm.</v>

747
00:51:04.450 --> 00:51:08.200
<v 4>Hi [inaudible] this is related to the previous questions.</v>

748
00:51:08.201 --> 00:51:09.880
Can you talk a little bit about the role,

749
00:51:09.910 --> 00:51:14.910
what you see the role of allyship is in closing some of these opportunity gaps

750
00:51:16.571 --> 00:51:21.310
for minorities in tech at both in the past and maybe presently if you have time.

751
00:51:22.030 --> 00:51:23.710
Yeah,
thank you.
So

752
00:51:26.400 --> 00:51:27.233
<v 1>I think</v>

753
00:51:28.790 --> 00:51:33.790
<v 4>being an ally is crucial at this moment too.</v>

754
00:51:35.170 --> 00:51:40.170
Recognize sort of for all of the people who are here around Google and other

755
00:51:42.340 --> 00:51:47.340
companies that we identify as tech companies to sort of look Billy,

756
00:51:48.460 --> 00:51:53.460
do you sort of individual and communal self examination to say what are the

757
00:51:53.621 --> 00:51:58.480
behaviors or ideas or our culture is in a particular meeting in a,

758
00:51:58.540 --> 00:52:01.780
on a particular team,
how might those be?

759
00:52:01.980 --> 00:52:02.813
<v 1>MMM.</v>

760
00:52:04.140 --> 00:52:05.310
<v 4>How might those be?</v>

761
00:52:05.730 --> 00:52:10.730
Not just sort of in some ways being harmful to people who are not like you.

762
00:52:11.840 --> 00:52:12.660
Um,

763
00:52:12.660 --> 00:52:17.660
but also how might they be amplifying privilege or,

764
00:52:20.390 --> 00:52:23.690
<v 1>um,
sort of,
uh,</v>

765
00:52:26.370 --> 00:52:30.720
<v 4>just creating sort of more comfort for people who are like you.</v>

766
00:52:30.780 --> 00:52:35.520
So I really do think it's this ongoing level of saying,
okay,

767
00:52:35.521 --> 00:52:39.110
I'm here and I want to be an ally.
I want to,
um,

768
00:52:39.480 --> 00:52:44.480
help support and hire and work with and empower people who aren't like me to

769
00:52:47.250 --> 00:52:51.870
enhance more diversity,
whether it's gender or race or sexual identity,

770
00:52:51.930 --> 00:52:55.020
sort of all the things.
Um,
but it's,

771
00:52:55.080 --> 00:52:58.620
it's really a level of awareness of boat.
It's that sort of a,

772
00:52:58.630 --> 00:53:01.140
it's the imaginary user,
right.
And,

773
00:53:01.230 --> 00:53:05.640
and not just the imaginary user of technology,
but in meetings,

774
00:53:05.670 --> 00:53:07.440
in spaces,

775
00:53:07.780 --> 00:53:08.613
<v 1>mmm.</v>

776
00:53:10.680 --> 00:53:15.540
<v 4>In corporate worlds as well as sort of the world's created by the technology</v>

777
00:53:15.541 --> 00:53:16.374
that we used.

778
00:53:16.660 --> 00:53:17.493
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

779
00:53:21.120 --> 00:53:24.780
<v 4>Thank you very much.
Um,
yeah,
you can talk to Rankin,</v>

780
00:53:25.830 --> 00:53:26.210
Professor

781
00:53:26.210 --> 00:53:31.170
<v 5>Rincon,
joy
and Jeremy for moderating.
Um,</v>

782
00:53:31.670 --> 00:53:33.960
we are wrapping up our talk,
but for all of you here,

783
00:53:33.961 --> 00:53:37.380

784
00:53:37.381 --> 00:53:41.940
So we encourage you to avail yourself of that.
And thank you very much.
