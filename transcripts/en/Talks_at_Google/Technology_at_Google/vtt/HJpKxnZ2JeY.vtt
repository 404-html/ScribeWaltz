1
00:00:06.310 --> 00:00:10.750
[inaudible].

2
00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.490
<v 0>Thank you,
Jack.
A A force of nature.</v>

3
00:00:13.840 --> 00:00:16.320
You're so a pleasure to be here.
Uh,

4
00:00:16.370 --> 00:00:21.370
I want to just actually tee up a bunch of quick conversations that we can carry

5
00:00:21.561 --> 00:00:25.940
to our fireside chat and conversation with you.
Uh,
so first of all,

6
00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.780
I'm clear that were alive during the most extraordinary time ever in human

7
00:00:29.781 --> 00:00:30.860
history,
right?

8
00:00:30.861 --> 00:00:35.570
There's never been a better time to be alive other than perhaps tomorrow.
Uh,

9
00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:40.220
we're at a time where each of us have more power than nation.
States had a,

10
00:00:40.221 --> 00:00:44.630
at heads of industries had just decades or a century ago.

11
00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:48.260
We forget how amazing the world is,
right?

12
00:00:48.261 --> 00:00:53.261
We forget that a hundred years ago in 2019 and 1918 in that one year alone,

13
00:00:54.710 --> 00:00:58.580
50 million people died from the Spanish flu,
right?

14
00:00:58.610 --> 00:01:03.320
20 odd million people died from World War One scale that to today's population,

15
00:01:03.321 --> 00:01:06.080
you'd be talking about a quarter of a billion people that would have passed away

16
00:01:06.081 --> 00:01:07.760
this year.
So we forget,

17
00:01:07.970 --> 00:01:12.710
despite all of the negative news on what I call the crisis news network and so

18
00:01:12.711 --> 00:01:16.070
forth,
we're still living in an amazing time.
Uh,

19
00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:20.180
it's also true that I think none of us really understand how fast the world is

20
00:01:20.181 --> 00:01:21.590
changing.
Uh,

21
00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:26.570
we're living in a world where technologies across the board are growing

22
00:01:26.571 --> 00:01:30.320
exponentially.
You know,
computation,
sensors,
networks,
AI,
robotics,

23
00:01:30.321 --> 00:01:32.450
three d printing,
synthetic biology,
ar,
VR,
blockchain.

24
00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:35.390
All of those technologies are themselves accelerating,

25
00:01:35.391 --> 00:01:37.280
but it's the combination of two,
three,

26
00:01:37.281 --> 00:01:42.080
or four of those together that are accelerating things add to that,

27
00:01:42.081 --> 00:01:43.760
the notion that in the next six years,

28
00:01:43.761 --> 00:01:47.600
we're going from 3.8 billion people connected on planet earth last year,

29
00:01:47.601 --> 00:01:50.630
at the end of 2017 to 8 billion people connected,
right?

30
00:01:50.631 --> 00:01:54.560
We're adding 4 billion new minds into the global conversation,

31
00:01:54.561 --> 00:01:56.420
have never been there before.

32
00:01:56.720 --> 00:02:01.040
And that's a massive empowerment for acceleration.
Add to that,
in fact,

33
00:02:01.041 --> 00:02:05.240
that we've got more capital available flowing than ever before.

34
00:02:05.241 --> 00:02:10.040
We hit all time highs in venture fund,
seed funding,
crowd funding.

35
00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:13.520
Um,
I see shows a sovereign investment,

36
00:02:13.521 --> 00:02:17.150
so more capital flowing at the same time that all the technology that we're

37
00:02:17.151 --> 00:02:21.980
using to make stuff happening is demonetizing faster than ever before.
Right?

38
00:02:21.981 --> 00:02:26.981
The human genome was sequenced for $100 million in 2001 today it's circa 500

39
00:02:29.001 --> 00:02:29.410
bucks.

40
00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:33.890
Alumina is projecting a $100 in one hour as is the Beijing Genome Institute.

41
00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:37.960
So there's more money.
Everything we need to do is cheaper,
right?

42
00:02:37.961 --> 00:02:41.570
And look at Google cloud computation capabilities.

43
00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:46.340
And so more people,
more money,
cheaper stuff,
more experimentation.

44
00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:51.230
And what it means is we're entering a period of a hyper acceleration,

45
00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:56.450
right?
As I think about how fast the world is going,
it's not slowing down.

46
00:02:56.451 --> 00:03:00.280
And in fact,
you know,
it's an acceleration,
the acceleration that we're hitting.

47
00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:03.970
So that makes for an amazing,
amazing future.

48
00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:08.080
And one of the things that I focus on a lot is the notion that there is no

49
00:03:08.081 --> 00:03:10.400
problem we cannot solve.
All right?

50
00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:15.040
And I'm clear that the right combination of technology,
talent,

51
00:03:15.041 --> 00:03:18.110
and treasure are,
can take on any problem.
And,

52
00:03:18.330 --> 00:03:22.870
and my message to a lot of people around the world is you're now empowered.

53
00:03:22.871 --> 00:03:27.040
If you are sick and tired about a problem or you're inspired to solve something,

54
00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:30.160
you can,
uh,
it's a matter of do yours.

55
00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:34.000
Do you give yourself permission to be that audacious and go do it?

56
00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:38.620
A hundred years ago,
the only people could actually solve a problem at any scale.

57
00:03:38.980 --> 00:03:43.780
We're the nation states,
right?
Or were the robber barons,

58
00:03:43.781 --> 00:03:48.781
the industrialists and even all they could do was unleash monetary policies or

59
00:03:49.330 --> 00:03:51.970
troops or so forth.
Today,

60
00:03:52.360 --> 00:03:57.020
I just want you to feel and understand how empowered you are to find a problem

61
00:03:57.021 --> 00:03:57.760
and solve a problem.

62
00:03:57.760 --> 00:04:02.170
That's what gives me hope that entrepreneurs by definition are individuals who

63
00:04:02.171 --> 00:04:04.030
find problems and solve problems.

64
00:04:04.300 --> 00:04:07.060
And there are more and more entrepreneurs with more and more data.

65
00:04:07.090 --> 00:04:10.150
We more and more computational power with more and more access to capital

66
00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:12.400
solving more and more problems.

67
00:04:12.850 --> 00:04:17.490
So I wouldn't give you that perspective for a moment.
Another area,
uh,

68
00:04:17.491 --> 00:04:18.460
I'm excited about.

69
00:04:18.490 --> 00:04:23.200
I serve as founder and executive chairman of the x prize foundation.

70
00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:27.010
Jack is,
uh,
for a while now,
since the earliest days,

71
00:04:27.011 --> 00:04:31.780
one of my trustees.
And so we,
we focused on,

72
00:04:31.900 --> 00:04:35.050
uh,
what are the world's biggest problems and they're not being solved.

73
00:04:35.560 --> 00:04:39.040
And how do we set a very clear objective and say,
I don't care.

74
00:04:39.150 --> 00:04:41.860
You know who you are,
where you went to school,
what you've ever done.

75
00:04:41.890 --> 00:04:44.770
If you solve this problem and hit these metrics,
you win.

76
00:04:45.300 --> 00:04:48.370
And to the very first x prize was from my,
you know,

77
00:04:48.610 --> 00:04:53.230
nine year old childhood passion of space for I gave up on NASA being the way I

78
00:04:53.231 --> 00:04:56.680
was gonna go to space.
I did the math and your chance are right.

79
00:04:56.681 --> 00:05:00.190
Mark went in a thousand of being a NASA astronaut,

80
00:05:00.290 --> 00:05:02.940
I had a better chance of becoming an NBA all star at five five.

81
00:05:02.950 --> 00:05:06.360
And I did a NASA astronaut.
And so,
uh,

82
00:05:06.370 --> 00:05:11.250
when I read that Lindbergh in 1927 cross the Atlantic to win a $25,000 prize and

83
00:05:11.270 --> 00:05:12.190
looked at the numbers,

84
00:05:13.160 --> 00:05:17.470
nine team spent 400,000 trying to win this $25,000 prize.

85
00:05:17.860 --> 00:05:22.570
And Raymond Orteig spent nothing on the losers,
only paid the winner,

86
00:05:22.690 --> 00:05:25.630
and Lindbergh was the most unlikely guide to do it.
So I said,
okay,

87
00:05:25.631 --> 00:05:29.410
I'm gonna create a prize for space.
Flight is going to be a $10 million prize.

88
00:05:29.411 --> 00:05:33.790
10 million was enough money to inspire the entrepreneurs,
but not the Airbus,

89
00:05:33.791 --> 00:05:37.540
the Boeing.
The Lockheed,
I don't want the large players just buying the prize.

90
00:05:37.541 --> 00:05:39.970
I wanted true innovation.
Uh,

91
00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:45.000
that $10 million prize inspired 26 teams around the world who spent $100

92
00:05:45.160 --> 00:05:49.960
million.
They're all optimists and Burt Rutan back by Paul Allen,

93
00:05:50.020 --> 00:05:55.020
who we just lost a funded that prize development and one it was spacial plan.

94
00:05:56.021 --> 00:05:59.840
Richard Branson came in,
bought the rights to create virgin galactic.

95
00:06:00.500 --> 00:06:01.820
Richard is publicly announced,

96
00:06:01.821 --> 00:06:05.750
he expects a flight to space approximately this month.

97
00:06:06.020 --> 00:06:07.250
So fingers crossed,

98
00:06:07.251 --> 00:06:10.070
we'll see something three weeks left in the month or there abouts.

99
00:06:12.140 --> 00:06:17.140
And then we on the heels of that [inaudible] an amazing board and very proud

100
00:06:17.451 --> 00:06:22.370
that we've had as board members and benefactors,
Larry and Sergei and Eric and,

101
00:06:22.750 --> 00:06:27.140
and in a multitude of,
of Googlers in the earliest days.
Uh,

102
00:06:27.141 --> 00:06:32.010
and folks like Elon Musk and Jim Cameron and um,

103
00:06:32.270 --> 00:06:35.660
Ratan Tata.
And so we've launched a bunch of prize.

104
00:06:35.661 --> 00:06:39.680
Let me give you a few that are active right now just for fun.
Uh,

105
00:06:39.710 --> 00:06:43.730
Elon funded a global learning x prize and we asked teams,

106
00:06:43.731 --> 00:06:48.731
can you build a piece of android software that could take a child in the middle

107
00:06:49.941 --> 00:06:54.920
of no place from illiteracy to reading,
writing,
and numeracy,
and under 18 months.

108
00:06:55.940 --> 00:07:00.470
And so Sundar very kindly gave us 5,000 android tablets,
uh,

109
00:07:00.650 --> 00:07:04.160
with the World Food Program.
We went into Tanzania where we are right now.

110
00:07:04.190 --> 00:07:09.190
We interviewed hundreds of villages and we found 2,500 kids who knew,

111
00:07:10.190 --> 00:07:14.210
know Swahili,
no English,
and put the tablets in their hands.

112
00:07:14.210 --> 00:07:16.550
We had 800 teams enter the competition,

113
00:07:16.890 --> 00:07:20.270
141 ish delivered software.

114
00:07:20.510 --> 00:07:22.070
We narrowed it to five finalists.

115
00:07:22.100 --> 00:07:26.060
Those five finalists are in 500 tablets each in the villages.
Right now.

116
00:07:26.061 --> 00:07:29.660
We're measuring the impact on the child,
the family and the village.

117
00:07:30.140 --> 00:07:33.560
And then we're going to open source the winning software.
Uh,

118
00:07:33.710 --> 00:07:37.900
the goal would be that this becomes part of,
you know,
android kernal for example,

119
00:07:37.901 --> 00:07:42.230
and the notion that every time an android devices built,
it's a teacher.

120
00:07:42.430 --> 00:07:45.280
All right,
we're,
we're building a billion teachers a year.
Uh,

121
00:07:45.290 --> 00:07:48.020
we had to go into those villages and set up power there.

122
00:07:48.170 --> 00:07:50.870
So that's one x prize we're doing.
Uh,

123
00:07:50.930 --> 00:07:55.070
one that we just awarded is called the water abundance x prize.

124
00:07:55.810 --> 00:07:56.211
You know,

125
00:07:56.211 --> 00:07:59.540
half the disease burden on planet earth is due to unclean drinking water.

126
00:07:59.750 --> 00:08:02.780
And so we asked the,
the team,

127
00:08:02.781 --> 00:08:05.990
could you pull water out of the atmosphere there?

128
00:08:05.990 --> 00:08:09.180
Quadrillions of liters of water in the atmosphere when it,
you know,

129
00:08:09.200 --> 00:08:12.470
when it condenses on particles,
we call it rain.
Um,

130
00:08:13.040 --> 00:08:15.410
and could you pull the APP but water out of the atmosphere,

131
00:08:15.420 --> 00:08:20.090
2000 liters for under 2 cents per leader from all renewable energy.

132
00:08:20.780 --> 00:08:24.780
And,
uh,
we just awarded the winner of that competition,
uh,

133
00:08:24.810 --> 00:08:29.510
about a month ago.
Uh,
I just came back from Greece and a,

134
00:08:29.511 --> 00:08:33.600
we have a,
an x prize going on right now on,
um,

135
00:08:34.010 --> 00:08:38.520
on mapping the ocean floor.
We've mapped less than 5%.
The ocean floor,
uh,

136
00:08:38.540 --> 00:08:40.430
the physics of salt water.
It makes it very difficult.

137
00:08:40.730 --> 00:08:45.730
And so we said to win this prize at $7 million put up by shell and by Noah,

138
00:08:46.630 --> 00:08:50.540
uh,
you've got to build an autonomous vehicle that can launch from land,

139
00:08:50.780 --> 00:08:55.010
go out some,
some distance,
tens of kilometers into the ocean,

140
00:08:55.350 --> 00:09:00.350
then go down 4,000 meters and map 250 square kilometers in 24 hours on its own

141
00:09:02.821 --> 00:09:07.800
return and provide the data,
right?
So fully autonomous,
large scale mapping.

142
00:09:08.240 --> 00:09:10.680
Uh,
we're down to five finalists that are in,

143
00:09:11.160 --> 00:09:15.180
in Greece right now off the coast of the mainland.

144
00:09:15.870 --> 00:09:18.300
And uh,
I met two of the five teams.

145
00:09:18.301 --> 00:09:23.301
One team is a group of 13 academics and Grad students from Germany of their team

146
00:09:23.971 --> 00:09:26.070
is two people at a Switzerland on the team is out of Japan.

147
00:09:26.460 --> 00:09:29.550
And it's amazing what they're doing.
It's transforming,
uh,

148
00:09:29.580 --> 00:09:30.960
what's possible in ocean.

149
00:09:31.410 --> 00:09:34.740
One of my favorite x prize is going on right now is called the Avatar x prize.

150
00:09:35.100 --> 00:09:39.390
And we asked teams to build a robotic avatar.
So a robot.

151
00:09:39.450 --> 00:09:43.440
So imagine I'm not here,
I'm back in Santa Monica where I live.

152
00:09:43.870 --> 00:09:48.150
And at home,
I've got on a pair of VR goggles and a haptic suit.

153
00:09:48.750 --> 00:09:51.740
And as I'm moving around the robots moving around as I'm looking at you,

154
00:09:51.780 --> 00:09:56.130
the robot's looking at you.
So it's basically a remote,
uh,
Avatar,

155
00:09:56.220 --> 00:10:00.960
a telepresence to allow you to go and,
um,

156
00:10:01.230 --> 00:10:04.290
and solve a problem,
do a medical diagnostic,

157
00:10:04.320 --> 00:10:06.160
go into a disaster zone and so forth.

158
00:10:06.161 --> 00:10:08.520
So we have over 400 teams entering that competition.

159
00:10:09.210 --> 00:10:11.950
So a lot of x prize is going on.
We can dive into more when,

160
00:10:12.030 --> 00:10:14.910
when Jack and I talk or you have your questions.

161
00:10:15.270 --> 00:10:18.050
Now the area I'm passionate about is human longevity.
Uh,

162
00:10:18.270 --> 00:10:20.970
I'm clear we're going to be able to add 10,
20,

163
00:10:20.971 --> 00:10:25.030
potentially 30 healthy years and everyone's life,
right?
Google.

164
00:10:25.070 --> 00:10:29.130
It's got a massive investment in Calico,
uh,
besides Calico.

165
00:10:29.160 --> 00:10:32.550
There's a multitude of different companies going on right now,

166
00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:36.030
company down in San Diego,
Samu Med that's using,

167
00:10:36.031 --> 00:10:38.370
that's manipulating a wind pathways,

168
00:10:38.371 --> 00:10:43.371
which is a communication pathway that's a $13 billion private company because

169
00:10:43.651 --> 00:10:45.090
the results are extraordinary.

170
00:10:45.091 --> 00:10:48.840
They're in phase two clinical trials on a multitude of different,
um,

171
00:10:49.500 --> 00:10:52.890
anticancer hair growth,
anti wrinkles,

172
00:10:53.150 --> 00:10:57.060
osteogenesis.
I mean,
it's incredible what they're doing.
Uh,

173
00:10:57.090 --> 00:10:59.520
you see companies like unity bio-sciences,

174
00:10:59.610 --> 00:11:03.720
which are working on synthetic medicines to kill senile cells,

175
00:11:03.960 --> 00:11:08.790
cells that have grown to the Hayflick limit and have stopped,
uh,
replicating.

176
00:11:08.791 --> 00:11:10.680
And then it becoming inflammatory agents.

177
00:11:10.950 --> 00:11:15.150
If you can kill those cells and make room for new cells to generate from

178
00:11:15.151 --> 00:11:20.100
endogenous stem cells,
the organism regenerates and,
uh,

179
00:11:20.101 --> 00:11:23.760
you get an extended lifespan.
Uh,
another,
uh,

180
00:11:23.761 --> 00:11:26.370
I have two companies in the longevity business.
Um,

181
00:11:26.670 --> 00:11:30.480
one is in the stem cell business called cellularity.
Uh,

182
00:11:30.510 --> 00:11:35.510
we have the world's largest bank of placentas.

183
00:11:35.730 --> 00:11:38.820
Turns out you can think of the placenta as the three d printer that

184
00:11:38.830 --> 00:11:43.560
manufacturers the baby,
and that placenta is the richest source of stem cells.

185
00:11:43.950 --> 00:11:48.950
And so those stem cells delivered back to an aging organism can extend life 30

186
00:11:49.921 --> 00:11:50.754
plus percent.

187
00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:55.240
As we age our stem cells in our bodies and all the compartments fall off very

188
00:11:55.241 --> 00:11:56.290
rapidly over time.

189
00:11:56.980 --> 00:12:00.790
And so one of the reasons for aging is we lose the ability to regenerate

190
00:12:00.791 --> 00:12:04.030
ourselves,
to repair ourselves or the stem cells in our body.

191
00:12:04.031 --> 00:12:07.390
They will drop a hundred to a thousand x in population,

192
00:12:07.750 --> 00:12:11.050
but they undergo epigenetic changes,
mutations and so forth,

193
00:12:11.051 --> 00:12:13.870
and they're not capable as they were before.

194
00:12:14.320 --> 00:12:19.300
So stem cell replenishment is another area,
a one fun one,

195
00:12:19.330 --> 00:12:24.070
uh,
that uh,
that I cofounded called human longevity.

196
00:12:24.071 --> 00:12:28.340
We're down in San Diego,
we'll be opening around the country.
Uh,

197
00:12:28.360 --> 00:12:32.320
and what human longevity does is you come in for three hours,

198
00:12:32.920 --> 00:12:37.450
we sequence your genome,
all 3.2 billion letters.
We do a 30 x sequencing on you.

199
00:12:37.451 --> 00:12:40.510
We sequence your microbiome.
We look at the,

200
00:12:40.690 --> 00:12:44.350
your metabolome basically the top 100 plus uh,

201
00:12:44.380 --> 00:12:48.310
proteins in your and chemicals and you're a small molecules in your bloodstream.

202
00:12:48.610 --> 00:12:52.900
We do a full body MRI,
head to toe,
a brain MRI,
brain vasculature,

203
00:12:52.930 --> 00:12:54.730
coronary CT,
lung CT,

204
00:12:55.240 --> 00:13:00.240
and then we feed about 150 gigabytes of data into our system to determine two

205
00:13:00.491 --> 00:13:01.480
things.
Number one,

206
00:13:01.481 --> 00:13:04.990
is there anything going on inside your body right now that you should know
about?

207
00:13:05.620 --> 00:13:07.960
And number two,
based upon your genetics,

208
00:13:08.200 --> 00:13:12.460
what are you likely to die from and how do you find it before?

209
00:13:12.461 --> 00:13:17.410
So the numbers are pretty telling.
The price point initially for uh,
for Hli,

210
00:13:17.411 --> 00:13:20.860
the what's called the health nucleus,
the facility was 25,000 bucks.

211
00:13:20.861 --> 00:13:24.550
So it's not cheap.
All the people who came were very,
uh,

212
00:13:25.300 --> 00:13:28.360
well to do patients,
so to speak.
Uh,

213
00:13:28.361 --> 00:13:32.980
the price has dropped down to 5,000 and 3000 for subsequent visits,
but still,

214
00:13:33.370 --> 00:13:35.890
uh,
then we in 2%,
right?

215
00:13:35.891 --> 00:13:40.891
So we're in a room of our roughly 102 of you have a brain or Aortic aneurysm you

216
00:13:41.501 --> 00:13:43.630
don't know about,
which is kind of shocking.

217
00:13:43.900 --> 00:13:47.890
2% and this is for population to older than you are here for 50 and older,

218
00:13:48.220 --> 00:13:51.820
have a,
uh,
have a high grade cancer tumor,

219
00:13:52.100 --> 00:13:55.150
a 3.4% have a significant cardiac condition,

220
00:13:55.160 --> 00:14:00.090
atrial fibrillation or,
or bundle branch block or so like,

221
00:14:00.460 --> 00:14:04.450
and we find 14% of the people who've come through have significant findings and

222
00:14:04.451 --> 00:14:08.290
you take action on immediately.
So the fact of the matter is we're all optimists.

223
00:14:08.740 --> 00:14:12.910
We think everything's fine in our body.
And then until you go to the hospital,

224
00:14:12.970 --> 00:14:16.930
at which point you're like,
oh shit,
you know,
I didn't know that.
And,

225
00:14:16.960 --> 00:14:20.230
but I'm a pilot.
I fly a couple of planes before I take off,

226
00:14:20.260 --> 00:14:23.770
make sure everything's in the green.
But for most of us,
we don't know that.

227
00:14:23.800 --> 00:14:25.920
Eventually we'll all have wearables.
We were talking about,

228
00:14:25.930 --> 00:14:30.930
I have my aura ring here rightly about that 1415 different sensors that measure

229
00:14:31.571 --> 00:14:36.520
my pulse wave form,
my temperature,
my acceleration,
and give me sleep data.
Um,

230
00:14:36.590 --> 00:14:38.200
I've got my Apple Watch,

231
00:14:38.201 --> 00:14:43.150
I've got a small little frid chip implanted over here.

232
00:14:43.180 --> 00:14:46.930
It's got my business card on it.
I'm completely useless,

233
00:14:46.931 --> 00:14:48.550
but eventually it will be something useful.

234
00:14:49.480 --> 00:14:54.100
But we'll all have this data uploaded to give us minute by minute how we're

235
00:14:54.140 --> 00:14:57.020
doing.
And the goal people say,
I don't want to know if,
and he's wrong with me.

236
00:14:57.021 --> 00:14:57.411
Bullshit.

237
00:14:57.411 --> 00:15:01.550
Of course you want to know and you want to solve it right then at the very

238
00:15:01.551 --> 00:15:05.270
beginning when it's most solvable,
right?
So it's going from sick here,

239
00:15:05.271 --> 00:15:08.880
which is what it is right now.
We take care of you after your sick to healthcare?

240
00:15:09.260 --> 00:15:13.080
Do you find anything at stage zero?
So I'll,

241
00:15:13.090 --> 00:15:17.060
I'll close singularity university.
Ray and I,
10 years ago,
uh,

242
00:15:17.390 --> 00:15:21.740
what month are we in?
Like 10 years ago,
two months ago,
we announced x.

243
00:15:22.140 --> 00:15:25.610
Now in singularity university,
uh,
I was reading Ray's book,

244
00:15:25.611 --> 00:15:26.960
the singularity is near,
and I said,

245
00:15:26.961 --> 00:15:30.110
there's no place in the world you can go and not Harvard and Mit,
not Stanford,

246
00:15:30.111 --> 00:15:33.230
not superior or whatever it might be that you can go and actually get an

247
00:15:33.260 --> 00:15:38.260
overview of all the exponential technologies and understand what they're able to

248
00:15:39.651 --> 00:15:43.670
do in convergence.
So we created a graduate program.

249
00:15:43.760 --> 00:15:45.950
It's now called the global startup program.

250
00:15:45.951 --> 00:15:50.540
Our goal is a thousand startups a year.
And then we started,
uh,

251
00:15:50.660 --> 00:15:55.280
executive programs or six day programs were executives come in and we'd give

252
00:15:55.281 --> 00:15:58.880
them an overview of what's going on in all the technologies and how they're

253
00:15:58.881 --> 00:16:03.200
converging.
And it's really about,
you know,

254
00:16:03.230 --> 00:16:07.460
awareness and education,
but it's,
it's,
we're growing,
you know,

255
00:16:07.480 --> 00:16:12.320
a good clip of 30 to 50% year on year.
So I'll pause there and,

256
00:16:12.321 --> 00:16:13.154
uh,
bring in

257
00:16:13.220 --> 00:16:14.053
<v 1>maestro</v>

258
00:16:19.490 --> 00:16:23.670
<v 2>a great opening talk.
Thank you.
Let's start with kind of activity.
Uh,</v>

259
00:16:23.710 --> 00:16:25.420
1969,
our Punnett,

260
00:16:25.690 --> 00:16:29.200
it's taken 50 years since then to get 3 billion,

261
00:16:29.230 --> 00:16:31.600
just about 40% of the world connected.

262
00:16:31.840 --> 00:16:36.550
4 billion people not yet connected to the Internet to everything that in this

263
00:16:36.551 --> 00:16:38.830
room,
uh,
we work on,
we build on,

264
00:16:38.831 --> 00:16:42.940
we engage in and other companies up and down silicon valley and around the
world.

265
00:16:43.290 --> 00:16:46.870
Um,
talk to us about a world of the numbers indicate not from us,

266
00:16:46.871 --> 00:16:51.040
but from third party sources that well,
it took 50 years to get to 3 billion.

267
00:16:51.190 --> 00:16:52.840
We might get the next 3 billion.

268
00:16:52.841 --> 00:16:56.980
That is the doubling of the number of people internet in about within six,

269
00:16:56.981 --> 00:17:01.270
maybe seven years.
Yeah,
very,
very soon.
Paint us a picture of that world,

270
00:17:01.271 --> 00:17:06.020
the world where suddenly,
uh,
you know,
huge swaths of countries,
uh,

271
00:17:06.021 --> 00:17:09.130
and others that are not online today suddenly become part of not just the

272
00:17:09.131 --> 00:17:13.120
information flow,
but also the global economy,
buying,
selling,

273
00:17:13.390 --> 00:17:15.970
putting stuff into markets.
Talk to us about that kind of world

274
00:17:16.370 --> 00:17:18.770
<v 0>question.
Uh,
so first of all,</v>

275
00:17:19.350 --> 00:17:21.660
<v 3>layers of conductivity that are coming online,
right?</v>

276
00:17:21.661 --> 00:17:24.930
And five g is probably one of the,
the biggest,
uh,

277
00:17:24.960 --> 00:17:27.810
incredible explosions coming online.
Uh,

278
00:17:27.811 --> 00:17:32.640
we'll see test deployments in 2019 and really full deployments in 2020 and

279
00:17:32.641 --> 00:17:34.120
onward.
And you know,

280
00:17:34.140 --> 00:17:38.130
10 gigabit connection speeds means you're downloading a movie in a fraction of a

281
00:17:38.131 --> 00:17:41.280
second.
You take your new LG TV set and put it on the wall,

282
00:17:41.340 --> 00:17:44.640
you plug in the power and it's got,
you know,
500 channels all of a sudden.

283
00:17:45.060 --> 00:17:49.890
So five g is gonna is gonna spread like Kudzu on the planet.
Uh,
on top of that,

284
00:17:49.891 --> 00:17:53.580
obviously loon is now been spun out as its own company.

285
00:17:53.700 --> 00:17:58.700
You've got one point $2 billion of money from Masa son at Softbank backing one

286
00:17:59.510 --> 00:18:00.343
web.

287
00:18:00.780 --> 00:18:05.780
Then you've got Elon who is gotten if FCC permission for 11,000 satellites,

288
00:18:09.090 --> 00:18:10.280
you know,
a set,

289
00:18:10.590 --> 00:18:15.590
a 4,000 satellite layer and a 7,000 satellite layer called cold space link,

290
00:18:16.010 --> 00:18:19.140
right?
It's startling,
which is incredible.

291
00:18:19.440 --> 00:18:24.270
And then you've got a terabit Boeing satellites in a meal orbit.

292
00:18:24.360 --> 00:18:28.860
So we're basically covering the entire planet with bandwidth.

293
00:18:29.310 --> 00:18:30.480
And then on top of that,

294
00:18:30.481 --> 00:18:34.830
we're going all have all of these micro cells on non licensed bands.

295
00:18:35.160 --> 00:18:38.520
I think eventually we're all going to be dribbling bits all the time.

296
00:18:38.580 --> 00:18:43.470
And our AI is going to be negotiating prices on different mechanisms.

297
00:18:43.471 --> 00:18:46.770
So that sounds like a great future.
Dribbling this,
dribbling,
dribbling bits.

298
00:18:46.771 --> 00:18:48.460
We're all going to be dribbling bits,
you know,

299
00:18:48.480 --> 00:18:51.390
I think we're all going to have our own personal version of Jarvis eventually,

300
00:18:51.670 --> 00:18:55.260
right?
Google now and echo and Siri are all,

301
00:18:55.310 --> 00:18:58.470
all versions of that,
which are,

302
00:18:58.530 --> 00:19:01.680
which you give permission to have access to everything.
Your email,

303
00:19:01.681 --> 00:19:06.180
your conversation to your,
your microbiome,
your cure bloodstream.

304
00:19:06.550 --> 00:19:09.000
And it's transacting constantly.

305
00:19:09.001 --> 00:19:14.001
But so 8 billion people potentially connected in the next six years,

306
00:19:15.090 --> 00:19:18.600
um,
as the price comes down.
Now the question is,

307
00:19:18.601 --> 00:19:20.820
can they afford these devices?
I,

308
00:19:20.850 --> 00:19:23.790
and so can the poorest people in the world afford those devices?

309
00:19:23.791 --> 00:19:26.430
So I've seen years ago,
uh,

310
00:19:26.520 --> 00:19:30.150
engineering drawings for a $20 cell phone or $20 tablet,

311
00:19:30.540 --> 00:19:35.310
there is a price point at which the price of the device gets so cheap that

312
00:19:35.311 --> 00:19:37.440
Google is going to give them away,
right?

313
00:19:37.441 --> 00:19:42.441
And Amazon's going to give them away to get the traffic to get the data to get

314
00:19:42.690 --> 00:19:44.010
the transactions.

315
00:19:44.310 --> 00:19:48.690
So I think we are heading very quickly towards a world of 8 billion people that

316
00:19:48.691 --> 00:19:53.370
are digitally connected.
And if you do the math right,
I mean,

317
00:19:53.371 --> 00:19:56.910
and I,
I,
I'm screaming this from the rooftops and no one's talking about this,

318
00:19:56.911 --> 00:20:00.360
which drives me nuts because 4 billion new people connected.

319
00:20:00.361 --> 00:20:04.380
And if they're just transacting on the average $10 a day,

320
00:20:04.560 --> 00:20:09.360
that's tens of trillions of dollars flowing into the global economy that no

321
00:20:09.361 --> 00:20:12.930
one's talking about.
And,
and the market,

322
00:20:13.080 --> 00:20:16.770
all of these 4 billion new digital,
you know,

323
00:20:16.890 --> 00:20:21.840
digital newbies are all going to want insurance and banking and education and

324
00:20:21.960 --> 00:20:24.330
healthcare.
They're also going to be creating content,
right?

325
00:20:24.331 --> 00:20:25.230
They're gonna be creating content.

326
00:20:25.231 --> 00:20:29.430
Now there's a certain number of dominant players creating a lot of the content.

327
00:20:29.431 --> 00:20:32.400
And also the of course is distributed content and crowd source content,

328
00:20:32.700 --> 00:20:36.620
but 4 billion people are not yet part of that conversation.
And,

329
00:20:36.720 --> 00:20:41.670
and what's going to happen is they'll generate content,
they'll generate revenue,

330
00:20:41.700 --> 00:20:46.010
but they're also going to demand these services at diminimous,

331
00:20:46.390 --> 00:20:49.210
you know,
freemium prices and it,
it,

332
00:20:49.270 --> 00:20:52.480
and I had talked to insurance companies and banks and I say,
listen,

333
00:20:52.960 --> 00:20:56.380
this is coming.
I said,
but that's not my marketplace.
So it's fine.

334
00:20:56.381 --> 00:20:58.090
It's not your marketplace today,

335
00:20:58.240 --> 00:21:02.830
but some entrepreneur within 50 kilometers of ground zero here is working on

336
00:21:02.831 --> 00:21:07.270
delivering value to those individuals when the new business model and then when

337
00:21:07.271 --> 00:21:10.810
it starts working and they'll bring it back to New York and Chicago and eat your

338
00:21:10.811 --> 00:21:12.010
lunch,
they're great.

339
00:21:12.260 --> 00:21:16.360
<v 2>Let's switch gears because we have a limited time.
Let's go open with genomics.</v>

340
00:21:17.050 --> 00:21:21.220
The first genome sequence,
Craig Venter's,
you know it was about 3 billion,

341
00:21:21.221 --> 00:21:25.570
went down to 100 million,
hit a thousand now about 500 and as you mentioned,

342
00:21:25.720 --> 00:21:28.600
probably were on the way to $100 would have been even less.

343
00:21:29.350 --> 00:21:32.890
And of course the analysis with that is as important as the sequence itself.

344
00:21:32.891 --> 00:21:35.470
And that's starting to ramp up the bioinformatics around it.

345
00:21:36.760 --> 00:21:40.990
Estimates are there right now in total putting aside smaller genomic tests,

346
00:21:40.991 --> 00:21:42.820
but in terms of whole genome sequencing,

347
00:21:43.060 --> 00:21:47.400
there may be are a few hundred thousand maximum a million people who may be at a

348
00:21:47.410 --> 00:21:48.700
seven plus billion people.

349
00:21:48.820 --> 00:21:53.820
When do we get to a critical mass that helps us understand the significance of

350
00:21:54.250 --> 00:21:58.150
billions of those base pairs that we don't understand yet the sequence

351
00:21:58.151 --> 00:21:59.440
significance of,
in other words,

352
00:21:59.590 --> 00:22:04.590
we have a lot of good sense about the usual 500 that are cancer drivers that are

353
00:22:04.720 --> 00:22:05.560
Onco genes.

354
00:22:05.710 --> 00:22:10.230
We don't have a good sense of literally billions plus of some of those,
uh,

355
00:22:10.290 --> 00:22:13.330
you know,
base pairs in sequence.
Tell us about the critical mass.

356
00:22:13.331 --> 00:22:16.300
We need to start on the sand,
the sample size that we need to.

357
00:22:16.910 --> 00:22:17.550
<v 3>So,</v>

358
00:22:17.550 --> 00:22:22.550
so we're getting amazing results with tens of thousands right now at Hli.

359
00:22:23.660 --> 00:22:27.740
I can't,
I can't state this stuff until it's published,

360
00:22:27.741 --> 00:22:32.000
but traditionally we talk about the exome,

361
00:22:32.001 --> 00:22:34.880
the part of the genome that codes for proteins.

362
00:22:35.270 --> 00:22:39.890
And the s two has been euphemistically called junk DNA,
but it's not junk DNA.

363
00:22:40.010 --> 00:22:41.270
None of it's junk DNA.

364
00:22:41.300 --> 00:22:45.610
It's all in some way structural or coding or control segments.

365
00:22:45.620 --> 00:22:49.760
And it's interesting that as you look at enough large enough population,

366
00:22:49.761 --> 00:22:54.350
you start to say,
listen,
these segments of the DNA are protected.

367
00:22:54.500 --> 00:22:58.040
Any mutation here is lethal to the person,
right?

368
00:22:58.041 --> 00:23:02.180
So we start to discover by elimination and by subtraction,

369
00:23:02.540 --> 00:23:05.390
fascinating parts of the genome that are worth looking at.

370
00:23:05.750 --> 00:23:08.870
And the other thing I might just say is it's the correlation.

371
00:23:08.871 --> 00:23:12.590
What was really exciting as the correlation between genome and then rich

372
00:23:12.591 --> 00:23:14.360
phenotypic data,
right?

373
00:23:14.390 --> 00:23:18.950
When we've got your genome and then we have full body MRI and coronary and heart

374
00:23:18.951 --> 00:23:23.180
CT and metabolome and so forth.
Then you start to really correlate,
Aha,

375
00:23:23.750 --> 00:23:24.890
that's what this does,

376
00:23:25.110 --> 00:23:25.490
<v 2>right?</v>

377
00:23:25.490 --> 00:23:28.740
And I was going to get to methylation of right now genome sequence coming down.

378
00:23:28.741 --> 00:23:31.350
But the ability to get to epigenetics in terms of methyl groups,

379
00:23:31.351 --> 00:23:32.184
things like that,

380
00:23:32.310 --> 00:23:34.920
talk to us about all the other rich information that's necessary.

381
00:23:34.920 --> 00:23:36.340
<v 3>It really draw those conclusions.</v>

382
00:23:36.341 --> 00:23:41.341
So I think one of the things that is true is this next decade is going to be

383
00:23:41.891 --> 00:23:46.891
just discovery after discovery and I think AI is going to play the most is is

384
00:23:47.451 --> 00:23:49.490
the only way we're going to make sense of all of it.

385
00:23:49.491 --> 00:23:50.900
The amount of data that's coming out.

386
00:23:52.760 --> 00:23:55.790
And I remember when I was in medical school,

387
00:23:56.090 --> 00:24:00.500
what got me on this path of one of my massively transformative purposes is

388
00:24:01.010 --> 00:24:04.220
making a hundred years old and you're 60 how do we have at a hundred the

389
00:24:04.221 --> 00:24:04.791
cognition,

390
00:24:04.791 --> 00:24:08.960
the aesthetics and mobility that we had at 60 I remember watching a TV show on

391
00:24:08.961 --> 00:24:10.420
long live sea life that some

392
00:24:12.310 --> 00:24:14.350
whales could live hundreds years.

393
00:24:14.380 --> 00:24:18.430
<v 2>Sharks could live four or 500 years,
turtles could six,
700 years.
And I was like,</v>

394
00:24:18.520 --> 00:24:20.900
if they can,
why can't we?
Right?

395
00:24:20.901 --> 00:24:23.080
And it's either a software problem or a hardware problem,

396
00:24:23.440 --> 00:24:27.580
but we need to swim more apt to be in a water cooler.
Body temperature's down.

397
00:24:27.800 --> 00:24:31.930
But,
but I really think we're going to start to unravel that and understand it.

398
00:24:32.170 --> 00:24:35.050
And let's jump to another area of healthcare,
which is our brains.

399
00:24:35.380 --> 00:24:38.530
You mentioned that we're going to live longer and it's already happening in a

400
00:24:38.531 --> 00:24:39.700
number of countries,

401
00:24:40.000 --> 00:24:44.280
but that also now is revealing greater populations with Alzheimer's,
Parkinson's,

402
00:24:44.310 --> 00:24:46.660
neurological diseases.
Um,
we have,

403
00:24:46.870 --> 00:24:49.980
we've had a good handle so far on cardiac diseases.

404
00:24:50.170 --> 00:24:54.760
Morbidity from chronic has actually come down.
Diabetes is on the rise,

405
00:24:54.761 --> 00:24:59.430
but there's some hopes there,
but talks about the neurological diseases.
Yeah,

406
00:24:59.431 --> 00:25:00.190
so,
so

407
00:25:00.190 --> 00:25:05.190
<v 3>we have cardiac conditions in our fifties and sixties we have cancers in our</v>

408
00:25:07.390 --> 00:25:10.240
sixties and seventies and we hid neurological disease in our seventies and 80s

409
00:25:10.241 --> 00:25:12.820
and the fact that matter is just for context.

410
00:25:13.480 --> 00:25:16.210
I like that until you prevent it,
right.

411
00:25:16.211 --> 00:25:18.880
Life is short and to the extend it and and so forth.

412
00:25:19.180 --> 00:25:24.180
But the human body was never intended to live past age 30 I mean,

413
00:25:25.091 --> 00:25:26.650
just to put it on the table here,
right?

414
00:25:26.651 --> 00:25:31.651
You would go into puberty at age 13 you'd have a baby and then by the time we

415
00:25:32.531 --> 00:25:34.480
were 26 your baby's having a baby.

416
00:25:34.900 --> 00:25:38.860
And back then a hundred thousand years ago before whole foods and Mcdonald's was

417
00:25:38.861 --> 00:25:41.200
around right?
When food was scarce,

418
00:25:41.620 --> 00:25:45.010
the last thing you wanted to do for the selfish gene was to take the money out

419
00:25:45.011 --> 00:25:48.130
of your grandchildren's mouths and now compete with them.

420
00:25:48.430 --> 00:25:51.160
So you would do the best thing you could give your bits back in the environment.

421
00:25:51.970 --> 00:25:56.410
But of course that's changed now and we're beginning to extend life.

422
00:25:56.411 --> 00:26:01.150
And as we extend life,
we run into new problems.
Um,
there is,

423
00:26:02.090 --> 00:26:06.530
uh,
amazing drugs in phase two clinical trials right now.
Uh,

424
00:26:06.550 --> 00:26:09.280
we're seeing impact from synthetic medicines.

425
00:26:09.281 --> 00:26:14.281
We're seeing impacts from wind pathway manipulations on cancers and uh,

426
00:26:15.160 --> 00:26:18.340
and Alzheimer's.
Um,
uh,

427
00:26:18.341 --> 00:26:22.120
I think one of the areas that is super exciting as well as the whole field of

428
00:26:22.121 --> 00:26:24.850
brain computer interface,
right?
My last count,

429
00:26:24.851 --> 00:26:29.140
there's probably $1 billion a year going into interfacing your neocortex with

430
00:26:29.141 --> 00:26:32.590
the cloud,
uh,
in buildings not far from here.

431
00:26:32.950 --> 00:26:34.720
And so at the end of the day,

432
00:26:34.870 --> 00:26:39.310
we're going to learn a lot about how the brain works and the root causes of

433
00:26:39.311 --> 00:26:42.790
these diseases as we have over and over again.
But a lot of it's going to come.

434
00:26:43.230 --> 00:26:47.970
Our ability to sense and gathered data and analyze the data is,
you know,

435
00:26:49.770 --> 00:26:53.790
billions trillions of times,
you know,
better than ever.

436
00:26:54.260 --> 00:26:56.940
Now let's turn to one of your first passion space.
Oh sure.

437
00:26:58.620 --> 00:27:00.990
Let's talk about really space travel that's um,

438
00:27:01.230 --> 00:27:04.090
we hear from Branson that it may be imminent,
uh,

439
00:27:04.160 --> 00:27:07.620
Virgin Galactic maybe launching imminently with paying customers and has been a

440
00:27:07.621 --> 00:27:10.810
long line of thousands of people putting their bets,
uh,

441
00:27:10.811 --> 00:27:14.950
in terms of their down payments on getting a seat on that ride.
Um,
which is,

442
00:27:14.951 --> 00:27:18.250
it's great to see that virgin galactic ticket holder is here in the audience.

443
00:27:18.251 --> 00:27:22.830
So the curiosity.
Okay.
Lots of customers potential.
Exactly.

444
00:27:22.950 --> 00:27:26.100
I'll take gut checks later.
Um,
but,

445
00:27:26.110 --> 00:27:30.090
but talk to us about what you see as the odds that we're going to be a multi

446
00:27:30.091 --> 00:27:34.680
planet species within,
say,
10 years,
20 years,
50 years.
Sure.

447
00:27:34.950 --> 00:27:37.260
We obviously have the potential that technology,

448
00:27:37.261 --> 00:27:40.890
I don't think that there's doubt that we can actually get to another planet now,

449
00:27:41.100 --> 00:27:46.050
but,
but talks about the will and the mobilization to make that happen.
Yeah.
So,

450
00:27:46.051 --> 00:27:51.051
probably the single most important driver that's making that happen is the

451
00:27:54.000 --> 00:27:58.470
individual passionate actor in this case,

452
00:27:58.680 --> 00:28:03.680
in the form of Elon Musk and Jeff Bezos and Richard Branson and just passed up

453
00:28:05.490 --> 00:28:07.350
Paul Allen.
And it's interesting,
right?

454
00:28:07.351 --> 00:28:11.490
A lot of these individuals grew up in the case of Jeff Webb known for 35 years

455
00:28:11.491 --> 00:28:12.390
since the early days of said,

456
00:28:12.391 --> 00:28:16.560
cause I was a founder of sets and said Jeff around the Princeton chapter,

457
00:28:18.180 --> 00:28:20.190
I remember meeting Jeff after he started Amazon.

458
00:28:20.230 --> 00:28:23.220
What are you doing with this Amazon thing?
And he goes,
well,

459
00:28:23.221 --> 00:28:26.370
I'm gonna make a lot of money there and spend it on space.
No Shit,

460
00:28:26.371 --> 00:28:31.260
really any lawns committed,
said I will spend all his money on opening up space.

461
00:28:31.261 --> 00:28:33.690
That is his,
both of them are that committed.

462
00:28:33.930 --> 00:28:38.930
And I think a lot of it was those who were born during the Apollo and shuttle

463
00:28:38.941 --> 00:28:43.941
era got enamored with this vision right from star wars and star trek and all of

464
00:28:44.281 --> 00:28:48.630
those things.
And then NASA never implemented it.
Never.

465
00:28:48.660 --> 00:28:53.100
It never paid off on the deal.
And so now you've got individual saying,

466
00:28:53.370 --> 00:28:55.910
we'll do it.
Um,
I,

467
00:28:56.160 --> 00:29:00.910
I've known Ilan since he sold paypal and just watched what he did with,
with uh,

468
00:29:00.960 --> 00:29:04.530
with space x,
with the Falcon one and one Ian Falcon nine and heavy.

469
00:29:04.531 --> 00:29:08.580
And I would never bet against him.
He is dead set on making that happen.

470
00:29:08.670 --> 00:29:10.510
And I think he will,
uh,
you know,

471
00:29:10.620 --> 00:29:15.360
he set a target at landing in 2024 on the Martian surface a cake.

472
00:29:15.361 --> 00:29:17.920
Listen,
I'll give him an extra four years.
Um,

473
00:29:18.030 --> 00:29:23.030
but could he get there by 2028 I would bet on him over any government hands

474
00:29:23.671 --> 00:29:27.550
down.
Uh,
and then Jeff is sort of the,
uh,
the term,

475
00:29:27.580 --> 00:29:32.520
the tortoise in the race,
right?
He's committed $1 billion a year and he's just,

476
00:29:33.030 --> 00:29:35.580
that is his end,
his end game.

477
00:29:35.700 --> 00:29:38.940
And so I think we're going to do it.

478
00:29:39.060 --> 00:29:43.360
I think it's going to be a function of,
um,
you know,

479
00:29:43.361 --> 00:29:47.440
I don't think governments can take the risks anymore that were inherent in the

480
00:29:47.441 --> 00:29:50.800
early Apollo program days.
It's way to,

481
00:29:50.880 --> 00:29:54.460
failure is not an option for them and therefore risk is no option either.

482
00:29:54.820 --> 00:29:59.020
But individuals can say,
I'm going to do this.

483
00:29:59.620 --> 00:30:01.510
I mean,
you know,

484
00:30:01.780 --> 00:30:06.490
there is a Tesla on a earth asteroid return.

485
00:30:06.491 --> 00:30:09.700
That's insane.
I mean,
just like game over

486
00:30:09.920 --> 00:30:11.580
<v 2>point.
Yeah.
Um,</v>

487
00:30:12.330 --> 00:30:15.000
you mentioned a number of great entrepreneurs and we can see how they're

488
00:30:15.001 --> 00:30:17.130
changing the world.
So let's talk about entrepreneurship now.

489
00:30:18.000 --> 00:30:20.820
Here in Silicon Valley,
we know the power of entrepreneurship.
We see it,

490
00:30:20.821 --> 00:30:24.030
we feel it.
These other key entrepreneurial centers around the world,

491
00:30:24.031 --> 00:30:26.430
but it's not spread evenly enough yet.

492
00:30:26.431 --> 00:30:29.130
It's not as inclusive as it needs to be and could be.

493
00:30:29.340 --> 00:30:30.990
And not only is that the case,

494
00:30:30.991 --> 00:30:34.350
we're missing out on the talents of many of those people from diverse

495
00:30:34.351 --> 00:30:39.210
backgrounds that could be part of the entrepreneurial journey and journey.

496
00:30:39.420 --> 00:30:41.730
Um,
what are your thoughts around how to change that game?

497
00:30:42.430 --> 00:30:43.690
<v 3>So first of all,</v>

498
00:30:43.700 --> 00:30:48.700
we're dematerializing democratizing demonetizing all the tools for

499
00:30:51.161 --> 00:30:52.970
entrepreneurship,
right?

500
00:30:53.020 --> 00:30:56.710
So it used to be that to be an entrepreneur,

501
00:30:56.890 --> 00:30:59.020
you need it to have computational power.

502
00:30:59.040 --> 00:31:03.250
You need to have an ethernet cable or a modem plug or whatever.

503
00:31:03.251 --> 00:31:08.050
And you needed to have,
now obviously it would Google cloud and AWS,

504
00:31:08.051 --> 00:31:13.051
you have all the computational power you want by the number is by 2023,

505
00:31:14.801 --> 00:31:18.610
I believe there'll be $300 billion available in crowdfunding,

506
00:31:19.360 --> 00:31:23.260
which means anyone around the world with a good idea can launch a crowdfunding

507
00:31:23.261 --> 00:31:27.510
campaign to get the capital.
So capital becomes less of a restriction.
Um,

508
00:31:28.060 --> 00:31:30.640
obviously Google makes the world's information available.

509
00:31:30.641 --> 00:31:34.920
So what used to be scarce resources,
um,

510
00:31:35.140 --> 00:31:35.980
I mean bandwidth.

511
00:31:35.981 --> 00:31:40.090
I remember back in 2001 night I stealth company called blastoff,

512
00:31:40.300 --> 00:31:44.260
my number one expense was Akamai on bandwidth to send video to people.

513
00:31:44.261 --> 00:31:46.750
It was like ridiculous.
And now it's nothing.

514
00:31:47.320 --> 00:31:51.380
So we're literally everything you need to be to,
uh,

515
00:31:51.750 --> 00:31:56.750
to create an entrepreneurial startup is becoming available globally at lower

516
00:31:57.761 --> 00:31:59.520
lower costs.
Uh,

517
00:31:59.620 --> 00:32:04.620
and so it's now the number one scarce resource that I seen entrepreneurship

518
00:32:05.621 --> 00:32:06.820
around the world is mindset.

519
00:32:07.780 --> 00:32:12.400
So I was just in Greece at an Su Athens summit,

520
00:32:12.480 --> 00:32:16.810
a meeting there with heads of the country and the entrepreneurs,

521
00:32:16.811 --> 00:32:21.490
and they were saying,
what do we need to do to become more innovative?

522
00:32:21.491 --> 00:32:23.590
It's a country of 10 million people.

523
00:32:23.920 --> 00:32:28.920
It's like one Google size success story dwarfs the budget of the country.

524
00:32:30.520 --> 00:32:34.810
So it's like you need to create a mindset of entrepreneurship.

525
00:32:34.840 --> 00:32:37.360
You have to have the,
you know,
some venture capital would be great,

526
00:32:37.361 --> 00:32:42.230
but failure needs to be an option to a lot of central and South American

527
00:32:42.231 --> 00:32:46.940
countries.
If you fail,
it's a black mark for life right here.

528
00:32:46.970 --> 00:32:48.890
We call it success at x.
You know,

529
00:32:48.891 --> 00:32:51.500
you celebrate a failure every week when somebody gives up their,
their,

530
00:32:51.920 --> 00:32:53.060
their company and say,

531
00:32:53.061 --> 00:32:55.250
we're going to spend our money and our time someplace else better.

532
00:32:55.460 --> 00:33:00.200
That's amazing.
So it's teaching that,
that mindset of failure.

533
00:33:00.260 --> 00:33:02.930
I had this conversation with rights and talk to one of our fellow trustees

534
00:33:03.390 --> 00:33:07.740
<v 2>who,
who in India,
it's really hard.
If you fail,
you're screwed.</v>

535
00:33:08.370 --> 00:33:10.560
And so you don't take big steps.

536
00:33:11.340 --> 00:33:15.780
And so he wanted to sort of dismiss that ethos.
And so he was like,

537
00:33:15.990 --> 00:33:17.370
we're going to celebrate failure.

538
00:33:17.620 --> 00:33:20.550
We're going to celebrate a great idea that was worth trying,

539
00:33:20.551 --> 00:33:23.900
that failed and give this person their next shot.

540
00:33:24.120 --> 00:33:25.740
So speaking of that mindset breakthrough,

541
00:33:25.741 --> 00:33:27.450
and then we'll turn to one or two questions.
So it is,

542
00:33:27.451 --> 00:33:32.340
if people want to line up the tea to Mike,
if people have questions,
um,
you know,

543
00:33:33.000 --> 00:33:36.360
you've,
you've now STM is now trained,
I don't know,
thousands of people.

544
00:33:36.361 --> 00:33:39.300
It must be now and exponential thinking and through x prize and others,

545
00:33:39.301 --> 00:33:42.950
you've also touched a lot of people and change a lot of people's mindset about

546
00:33:42.960 --> 00:33:45.470
what is possible.
Um,
you know,

547
00:33:45.540 --> 00:33:50.310
when you go back to the news reports on polio back in the early part of last

548
00:33:50.310 --> 00:33:50.520
century,

549
00:33:50.520 --> 00:33:53.940
it's written in such a way that people never thought it could be overcome.

550
00:33:54.560 --> 00:33:58.620
Today when people speak about cancer,
yes,
incremental progress.

551
00:33:58.621 --> 00:34:02.310
But most people,
when you ask them,
they don't believe that in their lifetime,

552
00:34:02.311 --> 00:34:05.930
we're going to see the management and containment of cancers.

553
00:34:05.931 --> 00:34:09.870
So identify for us three or four things that you think we should apply

554
00:34:09.930 --> 00:34:12.950
exponential breakthrough thinking and we're not doing today.

555
00:34:13.000 --> 00:34:17.550
We're going to look back 30 40 years from now and say we were people like polio,

556
00:34:17.880 --> 00:34:18.091
you know,

557
00:34:18.091 --> 00:34:21.450
looking at polio in the same way that we should have had a different mindset.

558
00:34:21.510 --> 00:34:23.440
The Sherman.
So let me talk about where the places

559
00:34:23.810 --> 00:34:27.540
<v 3>x prizes as a as a perfect example,
right?
So first of all,</v>

560
00:34:28.200 --> 00:34:33.200
we are in final steps for what I hope will be $100 million cancer x prize for

561
00:34:34.411 --> 00:34:37.050
going beyond liquid biopsy,
but very early detection.

562
00:34:38.830 --> 00:34:43.830
Something like a blood test or something like a pap smear or something that is

563
00:34:44.280 --> 00:34:47.880
tens of dollars.
Very easy to do type of detection.

564
00:34:48.120 --> 00:34:52.410
We're also working on a an Alzheimer's x prize,
same order of magnitude.

565
00:34:52.920 --> 00:34:56.820
One of my favorite prizes that I want to do right now is a fire detection and

566
00:34:56.821 --> 00:34:57.990
extinction x prize.

567
00:34:58.410 --> 00:35:03.180
The idea that we don't know when a fire starts is ridiculous,

568
00:35:03.540 --> 00:35:06.420
right?
So this is a simple x prize for me.

569
00:35:07.110 --> 00:35:12.110
A team has given 500 square kilometers of forest land and you have to detect a

570
00:35:13.531 --> 00:35:15.180
fire above a certain lumen level.

571
00:35:15.181 --> 00:35:19.080
Let's say five campfires worth the Ryan and you have to put it out within 10

572
00:35:19.081 --> 00:35:23.190
minutes.
And I don't care how you do it with drones,
with water balloons,

573
00:35:23.191 --> 00:35:27.390
whether the case might be,
I think if that technology exists,

574
00:35:27.870 --> 00:35:32.870
you insurance makes it possible and deploys it across all forest lands.

575
00:35:33.511 --> 00:35:37.890
We don't have devastating forest fires again.
Right?
So I'd love to do,
uh,

576
00:35:37.920 --> 00:35:41.520
working on a,
uh,
earthquake prediction x prize.

577
00:35:41.910 --> 00:35:44.070
I think it's a massive data play.

578
00:35:44.220 --> 00:35:49.220
There's no way in the world that a magnitude six earthquake doesn't leave a

579
00:35:50.040 --> 00:35:55.040
digital trail before it unleashes 30 Hiroshima bombs of energy working on a,

580
00:35:57.430 --> 00:36:01.650
a hurricane trajectory prediction x prize.

581
00:36:01.860 --> 00:36:05.550
So it turns out that,
uh,
that,
you know,

582
00:36:05.551 --> 00:36:10.500
all those wide area projections of our hurricane caused devastation.

583
00:36:11.040 --> 00:36:15.990
And if you can measure wind velocity at 10 meters above the center of the eye of

584
00:36:15.991 --> 00:36:18.390
a hurricane,
that's the missing data.

585
00:36:18.450 --> 00:36:22.320
So is there a drone or a technology for doing that accurately?

586
00:36:23.200 --> 00:36:24.390
There's energy x prize.

587
00:36:24.391 --> 00:36:29.391
We're working on a feeding the next billion x prize for a massive protein food

588
00:36:29.851 --> 00:36:33.750
production.
The way that we grow our protein today.

589
00:36:33.840 --> 00:36:37.740
This is a planet for cows if you didn't know,
right.

590
00:36:37.741 --> 00:36:42.510
One third of our non ice landmass is used in theater,
is used for,

591
00:36:42.640 --> 00:36:43.120
uh,

592
00:36:43.120 --> 00:36:48.120
is used for livestock production and that's crazy with CO2,

593
00:36:49.201 --> 00:36:51.530
water,
energy and so forth.
So,
uh,

594
00:36:51.580 --> 00:36:55.380
we've been working with a lot of the companies that are in the beginning of

595
00:36:55.381 --> 00:37:00.030
cultured meat to create a large scale cultured meat x prize for,

596
00:37:00.120 --> 00:37:01.600
uh,
for,
uh,

597
00:37:01.770 --> 00:37:06.360
meat and plant stem cell meat and plant based derivative that tastes better than

598
00:37:06.361 --> 00:37:08.760
what you buy.
And I guess finally,

599
00:37:08.790 --> 00:37:12.030
I know you've been thinking about housing for awhile in terms of the ability to

600
00:37:12.031 --> 00:37:15.690
medicine from an x prize,
but in general,
can we provide housing,
you know,

601
00:37:15.691 --> 00:37:18.900
for folks.
So with that,
we have time for two questions and we have two questions.

602
00:37:18.990 --> 00:37:22.310
<v 4>Most of these x prizes have to do with science and technology</v>

603
00:37:24.240 --> 00:37:28.050
or when they evolved humans,
they treat humans as individual units.

604
00:37:28.260 --> 00:37:32.970
How are you doing x prize that involves connections between humans?

605
00:37:33.680 --> 00:37:36.600
This in this,
the social space?
What would they be?

606
00:37:36.630 --> 00:37:41.370
Groups of people or a behavioral prizes?
Yes.
Yeah.

607
00:37:41.860 --> 00:37:42.760
<v 3>To be clear.</v>

608
00:37:44.310 --> 00:37:48.640
X prizes that have been successful so far have been for widgets,
devices,

609
00:37:48.641 --> 00:37:52.630
transportation modes and things like that where people can go and have a very

610
00:37:52.631 --> 00:37:55.000
clear measurable objective and can rapidly iterate.

611
00:37:55.510 --> 00:37:59.950
We've talked about doing competitions between regions,

612
00:37:59.951 --> 00:38:04.480
like cities or companies and so forth.
One my favorite x prize ideas,

613
00:38:04.690 --> 00:38:08.200
and actually the very first person I ever mentioned this was Larry Page would be

614
00:38:08.230 --> 00:38:10.960
a,
it's a two part prize.
One would be a happiness x.

615
00:38:10.961 --> 00:38:12.130
It's called a happiness x prize.

616
00:38:12.131 --> 00:38:16.330
Could you build a device that could physiologically measure your state of

617
00:38:16.331 --> 00:38:20.550
happiness?
Like if I asked you right now,
are you happy I'm a seven right?

618
00:38:20.610 --> 00:38:23.560
And the time you don't be a 10 or two,
whatever it is.

619
00:38:24.160 --> 00:38:27.470
But if you could actually accurately measure,
they even create,

620
00:38:27.670 --> 00:38:31.510
you could create a policy change at Google and then measure of did it make

621
00:38:31.511 --> 00:38:32.590
people happier or not.

622
00:38:33.040 --> 00:38:38.040
So I think the ability to measure first and then create state changes afterwards

623
00:38:39.490 --> 00:38:44.140
would be nice.
My approach to that,
but we haven't done it successful yet.

624
00:38:44.170 --> 00:38:47.260
We keep on banging our heads against it and continue to.
But thank you for that.

625
00:38:47.740 --> 00:38:50.440
You talked a lot about accelerating technologies in the near term or the term

626
00:38:50.441 --> 00:38:53.060
future.
And my question had to do with,
uh,

627
00:38:53.290 --> 00:38:56.230
do you think there's any risk of these accelerating technologies being misused

628
00:38:56.440 --> 00:38:58.030
by bad actors in the shorter near term?

629
00:38:58.300 --> 00:39:00.520
I'm thinking of things like China's social credit system,

630
00:39:00.521 --> 00:39:03.160
which just seems kind of like,
I dunno a nightmare to me,

631
00:39:03.161 --> 00:39:08.140
but like what are your thoughts on that?
Yeah,
so the answer is of course.
Um,

632
00:39:08.170 --> 00:39:12.000
and I would just say listen to social credit system.
First of all,

633
00:39:12.060 --> 00:39:15.840
anybody who went through school and got an a,
a,
B or a c or higher,
you know,

634
00:39:15.841 --> 00:39:18.210
review.
We,
we've had that all through our lives.

635
00:39:18.211 --> 00:39:21.000
It's the negative externalities that are the issue with that.

636
00:39:21.001 --> 00:39:25.410
But being able to tell a person how there's good parts of a social credit
system,

637
00:39:25.411 --> 00:39:29.580
if it's for the upside,
not for the downside.
Sure.
Um,
just to be clear,

638
00:39:29.590 --> 00:39:33.690
not to defend what they're doing there,
to be very clear.
Uh,
but,
uh,

639
00:39:34.650 --> 00:39:35.483
yeah,

640
00:39:35.610 --> 00:39:39.780
I'm clear that even though the world is getting better by almost every measure,

641
00:39:39.870 --> 00:39:44.220
uh,
uh,
you know,
the cost of food,
energy,
water,
health care,

642
00:39:44.221 --> 00:39:47.700
all these things are plummeting.
As life is going up.
As you know,

643
00:39:47.701 --> 00:39:52.440
childhood mortality rates have plummeted from 45% of people have kids,

644
00:39:52.441 --> 00:39:57.060
diamond or h five to now 4%.
All of these metrics are getting better and better

645
00:39:58.860 --> 00:40:01.920
and I think they'll continue to,
we're still gonna have terrorism,

646
00:40:01.921 --> 00:40:04.650
we're still going to have warfare,
will still have a whole bunch of things.

647
00:40:05.070 --> 00:40:08.450
The thing that gives me the greatest hope for,
uh,

648
00:40:08.490 --> 00:40:13.260
for not being decimated is that it's harder and harder to do anything in secret.

649
00:40:14.250 --> 00:40:14.700
It's,

650
00:40:14.700 --> 00:40:19.530
it's the flip side of loss of privacy that there are cameras all the time

651
00:40:19.531 --> 00:40:20.281
everywhere,
right?

652
00:40:20.281 --> 00:40:24.810
A single autonomous car with a lidar at generating 750 megabytes of data as it's

653
00:40:24.811 --> 00:40:26.910
going down the road to everything's being imaged.

654
00:40:27.120 --> 00:40:29.820
Whatever augmented reality goggles we're all going to be wearing are going to

655
00:40:29.821 --> 00:40:32.720
have,
you know,
a millimeter cameras looking out,
you know,

656
00:40:33.960 --> 00:40:36.630
1.6 million drones flying over the sky as the United States.

657
00:40:36.631 --> 00:40:39.510
So everything is going to be visualized and so your ability to do something in

658
00:40:39.511 --> 00:40:41.610
secret becomes harder and harder.

659
00:40:42.170 --> 00:40:45.680
<v 2>And that lets me sleep a little bit better at night.</v>

660
00:40:46.370 --> 00:40:50.330
But ultimately when I do my calculus,
the question is,

661
00:40:50.780 --> 00:40:55.190
are there more good people in the world using these technologies or bad?

662
00:40:55.550 --> 00:40:59.450
Sure.
We don't leave that to you.
All right,
thank you.
Thank you.

663
00:40:59.630 --> 00:41:03.650
So final word of advice to those in this room on livestream and good wash the

664
00:41:03.651 --> 00:41:07.820
sun and Youtube around the world.
You're at a company like Google,

665
00:41:07.821 --> 00:41:10.850
you're another company and you're managing five 10 20 people,

666
00:41:11.210 --> 00:41:12.260
maybe a hundred people.

667
00:41:12.470 --> 00:41:15.800
What is your advice to somebody as they're growing their career as they're

668
00:41:15.801 --> 00:41:20.801
building products to kind of tap into the kind of exponential focus that you

669
00:41:21.351 --> 00:41:26.330
have that you kind of live every day,
but in the practical day to day sets,

670
00:41:26.540 --> 00:41:29.510
what is your advice to folks?
So,
first of all,

671
00:41:29.540 --> 00:41:34.010
don't do anything you don't absolutely love doing.
I don't have to

672
00:41:34.010 --> 00:41:35.660
<v 3>say it more clearly than that.</v>

673
00:41:35.720 --> 00:41:39.620
I did do anything big and bold in the world and make a difference on the planet

674
00:41:39.650 --> 00:41:42.470
is hard.
It's extraordinarily hard.

675
00:41:42.860 --> 00:41:45.200
And if you don't love doing what you're doing,

676
00:41:45.440 --> 00:41:48.800
you're going to give up before you get there.
Right?

677
00:41:48.801 --> 00:41:51.980
So any of my successes are,
you know,

678
00:41:52.430 --> 00:41:56.210
overnight successes after 11 years of hard work.
And I just did not.

679
00:41:56.270 --> 00:42:00.620
I refuse to give up and sometimes there's an important point to give up.
Uh,

680
00:42:00.830 --> 00:42:04.940
but I didn't cause you know,
for x prize like is my zero g company,

681
00:42:04.941 --> 00:42:09.710
which anybody here flown in zero g mark has not yet.
Um,
you know,

682
00:42:09.711 --> 00:42:13.850
it took 11 years to get FAA permission to do this with a seven 27.

683
00:42:13.851 --> 00:42:17.480
I had a chance to fly Stephen Hawking.
He knows you're a GE was amazing.
Um,

684
00:42:17.570 --> 00:42:18.920
but I just refuse to give up.
I mean,

685
00:42:18.921 --> 00:42:21.860
I was like battling the FAA and I was thinking,

686
00:42:21.890 --> 00:42:24.620
you're going to die or retire before I give up with my attitude.

687
00:42:25.340 --> 00:42:30.110
And sometimes it because only because I cared about it that much.
Uh,

688
00:42:30.410 --> 00:42:34.400
the other part is,
and this is what are the ethos of Google,

689
00:42:34.520 --> 00:42:37.430
that the world's biggest problems are the world's biggest business
opportunities,

690
00:42:38.210 --> 00:42:39.800
right?
I mean,
I tell people,

691
00:42:40.160 --> 00:42:44.330
probably the company that's made the biggest positive impact on the planet is

692
00:42:44.331 --> 00:42:46.580
Google,
right?
In terms of,

693
00:42:46.581 --> 00:42:51.230
and you don't have to be a nonprofit to create an critically better world,
um,

694
00:42:51.260 --> 00:42:54.380
and then,
you know,
going to become a billionaire,
help a billion people.

695
00:42:54.890 --> 00:42:56.690
So it's those kinds of mindsets.

696
00:42:56.691 --> 00:43:01.250
I think that our convergent with the power that you have,

697
00:43:01.820 --> 00:43:05.180
I never astrum underestimate what you can do.

698
00:43:05.600 --> 00:43:08.540
Each of you are extraordinarily powerful to solve problems.

699
00:43:08.541 --> 00:43:12.590
So you'd have to have that,
that committed,
passionate human mind.
Great.
Peter,

700
00:43:12.740 --> 00:43:13.850
thank you.
Thank you very much.
