1
00:00:12.140 --> 00:00:15.900
Thank you.
Y'All have comics there,
so actually don't have to talk,

2
00:00:15.901 --> 00:00:18.570
which would be great.
Um,
you'll have to bear with me.

3
00:00:18.571 --> 00:00:22.830
I still get nervous occasionally and talks,
especially when I'm speaking to,
um,

4
00:00:23.020 --> 00:00:24.570
computery people cause I'm,
I'm not,

5
00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:29.660
I'm not a computer people that are computer person at all.
Um,
which is,
uh,

6
00:00:29.700 --> 00:00:34.700
what makes it strange to be talking on technical subjects at Google a fair few

7
00:00:34.951 --> 00:00:39.420
times.
So,
um,
uh,
this is me normally.

8
00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:44.930
Um,
I'm a animator cartoonists.
Uh,
my day job is a,

9
00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:48.900
is this sort of thing.
Um,
there's will effects,
uh,

10
00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:52.180
which I do do on computers,
but very reluctantly,
um,

11
00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:56.170
I started on iron giant hand drawn on paper,
um,

12
00:00:56.280 --> 00:01:00.170
like medieval peasant.
Um,
nowadays of course,
uh,

13
00:01:00.330 --> 00:01:03.510
we do everything on a,
on these big machines,
um,

14
00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:08.390
which I actually used to resent,
uh,
quite a bit.
Um,

15
00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:11.190
which is strange.

16
00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:15.350
It's strange that I wound up doing this comic about these two crazy kids.
Um,

17
00:01:15.510 --> 00:01:16.580
if you don't know who they are,

18
00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:21.180
you might've kind of briefly pass by them in computers.

19
00:01:21.181 --> 00:01:25.320
When on one,
uh,
Charles Babbage,
Ada Lovelace,
um,

20
00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:30.450
I first met them in 2009 a when a friend of mine,
Sue Sharman,

21
00:01:30.451 --> 00:01:33.930
started Ada Lovelace day,
which you might've heard of,
um,

22
00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:37.820
sort of online festival of women in computing.
And,
uh,

23
00:01:37.830 --> 00:01:42.690
we were in a pub and she said,
uh,
said you should,
you're a woman in tech,

24
00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:47.550
uh,
you should do a comic,
uh,
like,
uh,
you should do a post for Ada Lovelace day.

25
00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:50.190
Um,
so I said,

26
00:01:50.191 --> 00:01:54.370
I don't even know who ada Lovelace is an I'm also not really in tech.
Um,

27
00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:59.040
so I just quickly Wikipedia at her like anybody would do.
And uh,

28
00:01:59.760 --> 00:02:02.080
um,
it was just such an extraordinary story.
Uh,

29
00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:04.960
and to me struck me as very comic booky.
Um,

30
00:02:04.961 --> 00:02:09.190
so I just sat down in an evening instead of dashed off the following,
a chronic,

31
00:02:09.191 --> 00:02:13.120
which,
um,
this is cleaned up from its initial appearance.
Um,

32
00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:16.180
and this was just a to introduce,
uh,

33
00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:21.160
in laplace and Charles Babbage to people who might not know who they are.
Um,
so,

34
00:02:21.161 --> 00:02:25.990
um,
Lord Byron,
famous poet,
uh,
and that case,
uh,

35
00:02:26.570 --> 00:02:30.910
was married to Annabella Milbanke amateur mathematician.
Um,

36
00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:35.860
they split when Aiden was about a year old.
Um,
it had never met her father.

37
00:02:35.861 --> 00:02:40.710
He fled the country and a cloud of scandal,
never came back.
Um,
and it,

38
00:02:40.711 --> 00:02:44.740
his mother was very concerned that she would inherit her father's wild blood

39
00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:49.540
when people call this political tendency.
Um,
so,
uh,

40
00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:51.700
it is mothers,
uh,

41
00:02:51.990 --> 00:02:56.870
kind of solution to this was to a trainer and mathematics logic and science.
Um,

42
00:02:56.920 --> 00:03:01.870
so she had a very unusual education for girl.
Um,
Charles Babbage,

43
00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:07.500
uh,
Lucasian professor of mathematics,
a position held by Newton,

44
00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:08.890
currently held by Stephen Hawkings.

45
00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:12.340
So you can tell he's a pretty clever guy and his own age.

46
00:03:12.341 --> 00:03:15.140
He was extremely famous for,
um,

47
00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:19.090
these mysterious calculating machines that he was burning through government

48
00:03:19.091 --> 00:03:23.040
money.
Uh,
designing.
Uh,

49
00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:26.650
the most famous is the difference engine,
mostly because the name is really cool.

50
00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:28.200
And it also has a book,
uh,

51
00:03:28.240 --> 00:03:32.110
the difference engine written about what if you had built it.
Um,

52
00:03:32.380 --> 00:03:36.230
they met in 1833,
um,

53
00:03:37.630 --> 00:03:41.710
and um,
in a immediately fell madly in love with this machine.

54
00:03:42.250 --> 00:03:44.240
Um,
the,
uh,

55
00:03:44.530 --> 00:03:48.580
the fragment of the difference engine you can still see in the science museum.

56
00:03:48.700 --> 00:03:52.000
So wonderful objects,
but this big made of brass.
Um,

57
00:03:52.030 --> 00:03:56.840
that's the only part that was ever built of any of these machines.
Um,

58
00:03:57.760 --> 00:04:02.680
but the one that she,
when she was really intrigued with was,
um,
the,
uh,

59
00:04:02.710 --> 00:04:04.880
oh,
sorry,
this is a,
this gag,
uh,

60
00:04:10.250 --> 00:04:13.420
uh,
this guy I think might have spelled my doom.
Um,

61
00:04:15.250 --> 00:04:16.340
so,
um,

62
00:04:18.190 --> 00:04:21.490
after she met Bev and she immediately asked me for the blueprints for this

63
00:04:21.491 --> 00:04:24.890
device,
she was very,
very keen on machinery.
She'd always been,
um,

64
00:04:25.030 --> 00:04:29.140
kind of a fan of taking apart a little machines and Clark's,

65
00:04:29.141 --> 00:04:33.730
I'm doing factory tours,
that sort of thing.
Um,
so she was very,
very keen on this,

66
00:04:33.731 --> 00:04:37.480
uh,
device.
But,
um,
when she was really into was the analytical engine,

67
00:04:37.481 --> 00:04:42.430
which was Babbage's next piece of vaporware,
uh,
which was,
um,

68
00:04:42.790 --> 00:04:45.010
a,
she liked the difference engine.

69
00:04:45.011 --> 00:04:49.000
So the difference engine was a machine for addition,
uh,
uh,
to do,

70
00:04:49.001 --> 00:04:51.610
to print logarithmic tables.
Um,

71
00:04:51.640 --> 00:04:55.660
it was basically a gigantic adder that could print,
um,

72
00:04:56.400 --> 00:04:57.420
uh,
in order to,

73
00:04:57.480 --> 00:05:01.990
to print these books of tables that would be used by actuaries or navigators or

74
00:05:01.991 --> 00:05:03.580
whoever.
Um,

75
00:05:04.540 --> 00:05:08.100
pretty much the same year he meant Ada in the early 1830s.

76
00:05:08.110 --> 00:05:12.670
Babbage came up with an idea for a much more complex machine.
Um,

77
00:05:12.820 --> 00:05:15.880
the analytical engine would be,
um,

78
00:05:16.300 --> 00:05:20.080
would first of all have a memory so it could store the results and that it could

79
00:05:20.081 --> 00:05:23.560
feed the results back into the machine and use them.
Uh,

80
00:05:23.570 --> 00:05:26.580
and the whole thing was programmed with punch cards.
Um,

81
00:05:26.960 --> 00:05:30.720
and a little later in the talk,
I'll show you a kind of how it worked,
um,

82
00:05:30.760 --> 00:05:35.230
in pretty much every possible way except for being made of brass and driven by

83
00:05:35.231 --> 00:05:39.970
steam.
It was a computer.
Um,
Babbage worked on very,

84
00:05:39.971 --> 00:05:44.620
very elaborate designs.
Thousands of pages of notebooks on this machine.

85
00:05:45.080 --> 00:05:49.390
Um,
unfortunately because he had already failed to build us considerably less

86
00:05:49.391 --> 00:05:50.230
complicated machine,

87
00:05:50.231 --> 00:05:54.430
he wasn't able to secure any more funding for his analytical engine.

88
00:05:54.850 --> 00:05:59.790
Um,
but he worked on it for many years.
Um,
for Ada,

89
00:05:59.810 --> 00:06:04.190
it was this machine that she was incredible,
very deeply fascinated with.
Um,

90
00:06:04.460 --> 00:06:09.460
she knew Babbage for about a decade before writing this paper that she's okay,

91
00:06:09.671 --> 00:06:13.130
Ms Four.
Um,
and um,

92
00:06:13.131 --> 00:06:17.240
she being a woman,
of course her position had to be,

93
00:06:17.930 --> 00:06:22.220
uh,
kind of on the side looking in.
Um,

94
00:06:22.910 --> 00:06:26.900
but her kind of big chance came.
And,
uh,
42 when,
um,

95
00:06:28.220 --> 00:06:30.920
there was a publication,
uh,

96
00:06:31.070 --> 00:06:36.070
in a French paper from an Italian who had transcribed a speech of Babbage's in

97
00:06:36.531 --> 00:06:39.480
Trenton,
a in Italy.
Um,

98
00:06:39.560 --> 00:06:43.400
this was the only really public presentation Babbage had ever done on the

99
00:06:43.401 --> 00:06:46.070
analytical engine.
He was not secretive about it,

100
00:06:46.071 --> 00:06:50.060
but he wasn't really pushing it that much.
Um,

101
00:06:50.540 --> 00:06:55.540
so ada took this paper and translated it into English because translation was a

102
00:06:57.801 --> 00:07:02.240
acceptable position for a woman in science at that time.
Um,

103
00:07:02.570 --> 00:07:05.830
however,
because she was so,
um,
uh,

104
00:07:06.740 --> 00:07:10.780
into this machine and because she had many ideas of her own,
uh,
about it,
she,
um,

105
00:07:11.150 --> 00:07:15.440
again adding footnotes,
uh,
and when the paper came out in 43,

106
00:07:15.441 --> 00:07:17.750
I should say this is from the original comics.

107
00:07:17.750 --> 00:07:20.950
So this is actually the wrong date.
Uh,
in 43,
the paper,

108
00:07:20.960 --> 00:07:25.190
the her on notes were republished and the footnotes for boats three times as

109
00:07:25.191 --> 00:07:29.540
long as the original paper that she was transcribing.
Um,

110
00:07:29.600 --> 00:07:32.780
and in that foot in those footnotes has all sorts of really interesting things.

111
00:07:32.810 --> 00:07:36.710
Um,
the first description of a loop,
for example,
um,

112
00:07:36.711 --> 00:07:40.750
some wonderful programs,
I guess you would call them in a way.
Um,

113
00:07:40.850 --> 00:07:45.500
and her thoughts on the engine,
which we'll get into later.
Um,

114
00:07:46.220 --> 00:07:48.830
this is the program renewing numbers.

115
00:07:48.831 --> 00:07:51.140
It's more of what you'd now call a state table.

116
00:07:51.710 --> 00:07:56.210
It's just describing the setup of the machine in each a particular kind of

117
00:07:56.211 --> 00:08:00.050
iteration of what it's doing.
Um,
unfortunately,

118
00:08:00.560 --> 00:08:04.430
of course I love lace,
died a very young 18,
30,
30,

119
00:08:04.431 --> 00:08:07.160
six years old.
Um,

120
00:08:07.490 --> 00:08:11.510
and beverage never did finish any of these machines.
Um,
so,

121
00:08:12.500 --> 00:08:15.020
um,
this is me,
you know,

122
00:08:15.110 --> 00:08:17.570
kind of coming to the end of the story and Wikipedia and thinking,

123
00:08:17.571 --> 00:08:22.250
well I can't end the comic like that.
That's,
you know,
weren't right.
You know,

124
00:08:22.820 --> 00:08:26.150
that's a really demanding.
So I added the following panel.

125
00:08:27.020 --> 00:08:31.430
Um,
I,
I think I was vaguely aware of steam punk is a thing.

126
00:08:31.490 --> 00:08:33.680
I didn't read the difference engine,

127
00:08:33.710 --> 00:08:37.610
this famous book where they actually build a machine.
But uh,
I'd heard of it.
So,

128
00:08:37.611 --> 00:08:41.420
uh,
I just added this to be of a nice punch line to the comic.

129
00:08:42.350 --> 00:08:43.910
I think I was thinking of the Avengers

130
00:08:46.280 --> 00:08:47.480
if you see them actually.

131
00:08:54.160 --> 00:08:56.220
Um,
I also added the following,

132
00:08:56.221 --> 00:09:00.040
cause I'm sending you to bear in mind is I do hate computers very much.
So.
Um,

133
00:09:00.060 --> 00:09:02.640
there were two big misconceptions about this panel.

134
00:09:03.780 --> 00:09:05.850
The first misconception is that,
um,

135
00:09:06.570 --> 00:09:10.200
turned up in a all sort of all over the Internet a couple of days after I put up

136
00:09:10.201 --> 00:09:14.340
this little comic strip,
all of which you have seen at this stage.
Um,

137
00:09:14.700 --> 00:09:15.421
it turned up,

138
00:09:15.421 --> 00:09:19.290
I think in wired and a couple of other places saying this person is going to do

139
00:09:19.291 --> 00:09:23.080
a comic about Ada Lovelace and Charles Babbage fighting crime,
um,

140
00:09:23.160 --> 00:09:27.860
which I had no intention of doing.
This was a joke.
Um,

141
00:09:28.080 --> 00:09:31.320
the other misconception is that they're super heroes.
They are not,

142
00:09:31.350 --> 00:09:32.790
they are clearly super villains

143
00:09:34.440 --> 00:09:38.310
because they invented this horrible thing that computer,
um,
you know,

144
00:09:38.311 --> 00:09:42.030
which was the misery of my life,
uh,
pretty much every day.
Um,

145
00:09:42.090 --> 00:09:46.170
so the gag here is eight of course,
was raised to destroy all poetry and um,

146
00:09:47.040 --> 00:09:47.873
Charles Babbage,

147
00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:51.960
famous as he was for inventing these calculating machines was much more famous

148
00:09:51.961 --> 00:09:55.740
at the end of his life for his crusade against street music,
um,

149
00:09:55.950 --> 00:10:00.020
which made him infamous in late Victorian England and find more well done.

150
00:10:02.250 --> 00:10:05.900
I'm very suggestible and I was putting off working on something else.
So,
uh,

151
00:10:06.330 --> 00:10:10.710
I started this comic,
a treaty goggles and it was very,
very,

152
00:10:10.711 --> 00:10:12.540
very informal.
Um,

153
00:10:12.541 --> 00:10:17.220
it was really just a way of blowing off steam at the end of the day and to draw

154
00:10:17.280 --> 00:10:19.930
as well,
because in animation,
of course we don't draw,

155
00:10:19.980 --> 00:10:24.540
we manipulate objects in three d space.
Um,
so I miss drying and I was like,

156
00:10:24.780 --> 00:10:27.750
if I draw a little comic,
uh,
in this comic,
they fight crime,

157
00:10:29.670 --> 00:10:32.880
uh,
they fight crime badly cause otherwise it wouldn't be funny.

158
00:10:34.290 --> 00:10:38.910
Um,
I think the thing that,
uh,

159
00:10:38.940 --> 00:10:40.070
kind of,
uh,

160
00:10:40.260 --> 00:10:43.950
eventually through a strange series of events from resulted me and being here,

161
00:10:44.430 --> 00:10:45.870
uh,
is Google books.

162
00:10:46.320 --> 00:10:49.500
And I'm really not just saying this because I originally designed this talk for

163
00:10:49.501 --> 00:10:54.300
Google books
in California.
Um,
Google books was,

164
00:10:54.301 --> 00:10:59.301
is what transformed this from a kind of little squib of a comic into something

165
00:10:59.461 --> 00:11:03.810
that I think was genuinely interesting.
Um,
the comic began,

166
00:11:04.580 --> 00:11:07.340
uh,
when Google books was a very early stages,
um,

167
00:11:07.470 --> 00:11:10.560
and it was dumping the 19th century,

168
00:11:11.190 --> 00:11:15.630
a searchable online in a way that had never happened before.
Um,

169
00:11:15.660 --> 00:11:19.110
and that meant any random clown such as me,
uh,

170
00:11:19.140 --> 00:11:23.940
could just type Babbage Lovelace into these search terms and turn up,
uh,

171
00:11:24.720 --> 00:11:28.420
just sheer amounts of stuff.
Um,
this is very typical.
Um,

172
00:11:28.590 --> 00:11:31.680
I think the first thing that I was really surprised to find was that beverage

173
00:11:31.681 --> 00:11:32.760
and Lovelace were very,

174
00:11:32.761 --> 00:11:37.290
very famous people in their period Lovelace was a celebrity child.

175
00:11:37.920 --> 00:11:39.480
Um,
and uh,

176
00:11:39.540 --> 00:11:44.460
Babbage was actually a big time celebrity himself as this sort of intellectual

177
00:11:44.461 --> 00:11:48.150
who had invented this amazing thing that nobody could understand.
Um,

178
00:11:48.151 --> 00:11:51.920
so this is from the Deseret news in Utah.
Um,

179
00:11:52.260 --> 00:11:54.070
just a piece of anecdotes about them,

180
00:11:54.070 --> 00:11:59.050
<v 2>which is very commonly the way this shows up.
Um,
I like this one beverage,</v>

181
00:11:59.051 --> 00:12:00.460
the log with medical Frankenstein,

182
00:12:04.160 --> 00:12:08.000
<v 0>lovely stuff,
shows up considerably less than vantage.
Um,</v>

183
00:12:09.050 --> 00:12:12.440
uh,
yeah.
Um,
they love,
they say he was amused by my saying that babies are not,

184
00:12:12.441 --> 00:12:15.390
Byron should have been her father.
She was apparently a bit of a bore.

185
00:12:15.391 --> 00:12:18.800
That's one of the things that you can get out of people's anecdotes about her is

186
00:12:18.801 --> 00:12:22.730
that she was a bit of a drag talking about mathematics,
uh,
at dinner parties,

187
00:12:22.820 --> 00:12:25.280
which I advise you not to do.
Um,

188
00:12:27.180 --> 00:12:29.810
so you get a ton of stuff on Babbage all the time.

189
00:12:29.811 --> 00:12:34.310
Not so much about Lovelace because she's much more,
um,
uh,
being female.

190
00:12:34.311 --> 00:12:37.540
Of course she's the less public figure,
but,
um,

191
00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:40.340
it was enough to kind of,
um,

192
00:12:41.180 --> 00:12:44.000
start adding these little bits to the blog.

193
00:12:44.001 --> 00:12:47.440
So this is the way that the blog developed.
Um,

194
00:12:47.450 --> 00:12:49.250
this would be the end of the comic.

195
00:12:49.400 --> 00:12:54.040
Here's Ada Lovelace being chased by monkeys is,
uh,
of course you are.
And then,

196
00:12:54.610 --> 00:12:56.840
uh,
then they'd be followed by all these footnotes,

197
00:12:56.841 --> 00:13:01.780
which would be whatever stuff I had found a online,
um,

198
00:13:01.820 --> 00:13:05.270
just sort of browsing around,
um,

199
00:13:06.200 --> 00:13:10.130
training methods of Oregon grinders,
monkeys,
the Bridgewater treatise,

200
00:13:10.131 --> 00:13:10.690
which was this

201
00:13:10.690 --> 00:13:14.410
<v 2>bring the baby trout.
So,
um,
through that</v>

202
00:13:14.580 --> 00:13:19.580
<v 0>kind of combination of improvising online and reading,</v>

203
00:13:20.340 --> 00:13:21.173
uh,

204
00:13:21.240 --> 00:13:25.740
I guess eye witness accounts of them in the period I was constructing these

205
00:13:25.741 --> 00:13:28.590
characters,
and they're very consciously comic book characters.

206
00:13:28.591 --> 00:13:33.591
They're not intended as a kind of reproduction of them as historical people,

207
00:13:33.931 --> 00:13:36.660
but they're there,
I guess a riff for an improvisation on them.

208
00:13:37.300 --> 00:13:40.590
<v 2>Um,
love Olsen,
he was Babbage.
Um,</v>

209
00:13:40.670 --> 00:13:44.920
<v 0>damage is always very easy to draw it because he wrote it tons of stuff
actually,</v>

210
00:13:44.921 --> 00:13:45.754
even though,

211
00:13:45.760 --> 00:13:48.970
weirdly the only thing he didn't write about was the analytical engine.

212
00:13:49.480 --> 00:13:53.620
He wrote about taxation and he wrote about copyright and he wrote this massive

213
00:13:53.621 --> 00:13:56.470
autobiography that's super entertaining.
Very,
very funny.

214
00:13:56.690 --> 00:14:00.040
<v 2>Janie guy.
Um,
so his personality,
super clear.</v>

215
00:14:00.070 --> 00:14:03.500
I was really pleased to find this in punch a,

216
00:14:03.501 --> 00:14:07.310
so this is him in 1852 he's really angry that his,
um,

217
00:14:07.650 --> 00:14:09.590
they didn't put it as a,
the engine,

218
00:14:09.870 --> 00:14:13.610
the difference engine bid and the grid exhibition.
Uh,
so he's,
uh,

219
00:14:14.450 --> 00:14:18.890
he was only honorably mentioned,
so he's pretty mad how,
but I think,
you know,

220
00:14:18.891 --> 00:14:19.724
he comes out,

221
00:14:23.120 --> 00:14:25.640
<v 0>this is a,
so,
um,
just to kind of,</v>

222
00:14:26.530 --> 00:14:29.180
I said I talk about my process of creative transformation,

223
00:14:29.181 --> 00:14:31.550
so I guess that's what I'll do.
So this is,
um,
the,
uh,

224
00:14:31.610 --> 00:14:35.840
New York near 1833 this is the same year she might Babbage.
Um,
I don't,

225
00:14:35.900 --> 00:14:38.480
if you can't read it,
it says,
oh fine.

226
00:14:38.510 --> 00:14:42.080
And a said that eight of Byron sole daughter of the noble borrowed is the most

227
00:14:42.081 --> 00:14:46.370
course and vulgar woman in England.
Um,
which is one of those things that,

228
00:14:46.371 --> 00:14:49.820
you know,
it's very intriguing and it's true in her letter,
she does swear,

229
00:14:50.210 --> 00:14:54.430
which is very unusual.
The terrain women.
Um,

230
00:14:54.530 --> 00:14:57.500
this is something else I found.
This is from,
uh,

231
00:14:57.590 --> 00:15:00.500
this is actually from beverages pamphlet on the great exhibition,

232
00:15:00.501 --> 00:15:04.460
which is mostly about why isn't my engine integrative submission and where he's

233
00:15:04.461 --> 00:15:05.720
describing what it can do.

234
00:15:05.721 --> 00:15:09.340
And one of the things that he describes is the world's first error pop up.

235
00:15:10.280 --> 00:15:12.770
Um,
if you put the wrong logarithm in it,

236
00:15:12.771 --> 00:15:16.220
we'll put a plate that would snap up and say wrong.

237
00:15:18.700 --> 00:15:22.400
Um,
and is that a bag of enc continually ringing loud?
Bell

238
00:15:24.570 --> 00:15:29.510
should be fantastic.
I'm sure if you were the guy in charge of the machine.
Um,

239
00:15:29.511 --> 00:15:31.350
so with this,
I came up with the eight.

240
00:15:31.351 --> 00:15:35.390
All of this is debugging a whenever programs here in the engine

241
00:15:40.220 --> 00:15:43.190
Babbage's showing the engine to Queen Victoria of course.

242
00:15:46.250 --> 00:15:50.540
Um,
so the comic,
I,
you know,
generally speaking,

243
00:15:50.541 --> 00:15:51.620
if you read the book,
it's,

244
00:15:51.621 --> 00:15:56.270
it's mostly me making fun of computers and you just using these hapless people

245
00:15:56.271 --> 00:15:59.060
as my,
uh,
tools for this.
Um,

246
00:16:01.010 --> 00:16:03.740
but I was able to find as well,
um,

247
00:16:03.790 --> 00:16:07.040
some really magical stuff in Google books and I guess,
you know,

248
00:16:07.041 --> 00:16:08.150
important unimportant but,
but

249
00:16:08.280 --> 00:16:12.040
<v 2>really important stuff as well.
Um,
this is a letter that</v>

250
00:16:12.290 --> 00:16:14.480
<v 0>certainly had been lost,
um,</v>

251
00:16:14.810 --> 00:16:19.070
to scholarships if it hadn't been for do little books because it's only appears

252
00:16:19.071 --> 00:16:24.070
as far as I know,
in a very obscure,
a journal called the southern review,
um,

253
00:16:24.440 --> 00:16:26.040
Maryland 18

254
00:16:26.390 --> 00:16:29.540
<v 2>before,
um,
and they're just printing letters</v>

255
00:16:29.630 --> 00:16:33.100
<v 0>home from people and just random stuff and there's yeah,</v>

256
00:16:33.150 --> 00:16:36.780
<v 2>die who met damage in there.
Um,
and we have here</v>

257
00:16:38.470 --> 00:16:42.990
show spoke highly of a mathematical powers under peculiar capability,

258
00:16:43.080 --> 00:16:45.410
higher see,
said the net of anyone he knew to prepare,

259
00:16:45.430 --> 00:16:49.290
I believe it was the descriptions connected with is calculating machine.
Um,

260
00:16:49.291 --> 00:16:51.470
he says,
I fear not expressing myself rightly here.

261
00:16:51.560 --> 00:16:52.970
<v 0>So the precise nature of the subject,</v>

262
00:16:52.971 --> 00:16:56.490
I think he's the descriptions is the state tables,
the programs,

263
00:16:57.400 --> 00:17:00.280
<v 2>um,
which is like,
you know,</v>

264
00:17:00.281 --> 00:17:04.480
it's pretty magical to find something like that.
Um,
there's a,
it's quite long.

265
00:17:04.481 --> 00:17:07.750
He goes,
he really goes into,
um,
kind of the relationship.

266
00:17:07.751 --> 00:17:10.990
It's a couple of years after Ada had died.
Um,

267
00:17:12.340 --> 00:17:15.470
so that kind of,
uh,

268
00:17:15.580 --> 00:17:16.570
<v 0>thing,
you know,
this.</v>

269
00:17:16.571 --> 00:17:21.571
So I guess the intersection between scholarship and primary sources and then

270
00:17:24.341 --> 00:17:28.090
just improvisation and imagination that that's what the comic was basically

271
00:17:28.091 --> 00:17:32.980
about.
Um,
so,
um,
these two characters,

272
00:17:32.981 --> 00:17:37.010
I think,
uh,
you know,
became pretty clear to me.
Um,

273
00:17:37.120 --> 00:17:38.590
when I had to sit down to write a book,

274
00:17:38.591 --> 00:17:41.140
I didn't have to sit down to write a book that they told me to write a book.

275
00:17:41.141 --> 00:17:41.974
So I wrote a book.

276
00:17:43.720 --> 00:17:47.340
There was a third character that a I had to come to grips with and that was the

277
00:17:47.341 --> 00:17:49.490
analytical engine.
Um,

278
00:17:49.560 --> 00:17:54.550
the analytical engine in the comic appears like this.
Um,
this is George Eliot,

279
00:17:54.560 --> 00:17:58.320
uh,
getting her novels spellchecked uh,
in machine,

280
00:17:58.530 --> 00:18:03.180
she gets lost in almost eaten.
But,
uh,
um,
in the comic,

281
00:18:03.181 --> 00:18:05.120
the machine,
like the way it's,

282
00:18:05.170 --> 00:18:08.400
I actually described by contemporary people and even by Babbage and even by

283
00:18:08.401 --> 00:18:09.210
Lovelace,

284
00:18:09.210 --> 00:18:13.620
you just get this impression of this enormous bunch of cogs doing something.

285
00:18:14.190 --> 00:18:17.970
Um,
and it's very complicated and you can't understand it.
Um,

286
00:18:19.380 --> 00:18:21.300
but,
um,
uh,

287
00:18:22.020 --> 00:18:25.100
because I had so much primary stuff about a beverage and Lovelace,

288
00:18:25.110 --> 00:18:29.910
I felt I had to have,
now here's the real analytical engine.
Um,

289
00:18:30.390 --> 00:18:33.360
so I sat down to do a visualization,
um,

290
00:18:33.660 --> 00:18:38.110
and I was very upset to find that no one had done one that I could rip off.
Um,

291
00:18:39.120 --> 00:18:42.540
I had was the Babbage plans.
So this is,
um,

292
00:18:43.140 --> 00:18:45.960
plan 25 and this is a pretty famous image.

293
00:18:45.961 --> 00:18:50.340
You might've seen it in computer street books.
Um,
but,
um,

294
00:18:50.610 --> 00:18:54.510
actually it's a lot more ambiguous than it might seem.
Um,
you know,

295
00:18:54.511 --> 00:18:56.370
these are the cards,
the famous punch cards,

296
00:18:56.371 --> 00:18:59.550
but how are they attached and where do they go?
Are they up?
Are they down?

297
00:18:59.551 --> 00:19:04.250
Are they to scale?
Um,
uh,
Babish left,
not a lot of elevations,

298
00:19:04.251 --> 00:19:07.670
which makes it hard to kind of understand the machine.
Um,

299
00:19:08.670 --> 00:19:13.170
so I had to sit down with these plans and I have to say also used,
um,

300
00:19:13.260 --> 00:19:14.910
the scholarly work of Alan Bromley,

301
00:19:14.911 --> 00:19:19.680
the late Allen Brownlee who really went through and explained the mathematics of

302
00:19:19.681 --> 00:19:22.260
the machine,
um,
with extreme detail.

303
00:19:22.530 --> 00:19:26.400
So between the Bromley papers and the diagrams,

304
00:19:26.401 --> 00:19:30.690
I was able to do some elevations.
Come on.
There we go.

305
00:19:33.790 --> 00:19:34.623
<v 3>MMM.</v>

306
00:19:36.050 --> 00:19:39.660
<v 0>That's the scale.
It's a really big machine.
Um,</v>

307
00:19:39.800 --> 00:19:44.440
to get a sense of kind of the reality of this thing.
Um,

308
00:19:45.680 --> 00:19:49.560
and using that I was able to produce this,
which was the first,
um,

309
00:19:49.580 --> 00:19:52.790
visualization to my knowledge of the machine.
Um,

310
00:19:52.850 --> 00:19:57.460
it should be fairly accurate ish.
Um,
I,

311
00:19:57.461 --> 00:20:00.330
I have a feeling it couldn't have been free standing like this,
um,

312
00:20:00.350 --> 00:20:02.320
just because of the sheer weight of the thing I have.

313
00:20:02.420 --> 00:20:05.620
I think it would have probably have to be in with those warehouse buildings

314
00:20:05.630 --> 00:20:08.200
basically embedded into the structure.

315
00:20:08.520 --> 00:20:12.870
<v 2>Uh,
uh,
pretty heavy FTE building.
Um,</v>

316
00:20:13.800 --> 00:20:14.633
but um,

317
00:20:16.230 --> 00:20:18.760
<v 0>oh,
go over how this machine works.
Uh,</v>

318
00:20:18.810 --> 00:20:23.740
cause that's kind of my purpose for being here I suppose.
Um,

319
00:20:25.850 --> 00:20:27.650
so this is the a store,

320
00:20:28.110 --> 00:20:32.100
<v 2>um,
which is the memory basically.
Um,</v>

321
00:20:33.080 --> 00:20:37.760
<v 0>it's a lot easier to describe this machine,
um,
in,
uh,</v>

322
00:20:37.800 --> 00:20:41.850
Maya actually,
so I'm going to switch over.
Um,

323
00:20:41.930 --> 00:20:45.980
Babbage himself said that one of the reasons he didn't describe his machine very

324
00:20:45.981 --> 00:20:49.780
much was because it's difficult to explain,
um,

325
00:20:49.810 --> 00:20:54.730
how it works without being able to show it.
And boy,
is he ever right because,
um,

326
00:20:55.240 --> 00:20:58.360
I find it impossible to explain without,
uh,
without,

327
00:20:58.390 --> 00:21:01.300
and I found it actually impossible to understand,
uh,

328
00:21:01.330 --> 00:21:05.350
without basically building it and animating it.
Um,

329
00:21:05.710 --> 00:21:09.280
but that wound up being a really,
really good tool.
Um,

330
00:21:09.310 --> 00:21:12.090
so this is just a slice of it,
uh,

331
00:21:12.460 --> 00:21:17.310
to see how the whole thing looks.
Turn on who,

332
00:21:17.380 --> 00:21:21.880
here's my name and convention whole thing.
Okay.
There we go.

333
00:21:22.030 --> 00:21:22.863
So

334
00:21:23.940 --> 00:21:24.773
<v 3>I'm on</v>

335
00:21:25.430 --> 00:21:27.940
<v 0>as you can,
you can see why I'm only using a slice.
It's,
it's,</v>

336
00:21:29.050 --> 00:21:33.040
my laptop is pretty strong,
but it's really struggling with the,
um,

337
00:21:34.120 --> 00:21:34.953
there we go.

338
00:21:39.040 --> 00:21:41.470
There we go.
Okay.
There we go.
So,
um,

339
00:21:41.740 --> 00:21:46.740
when you're looking at here is a machine for manipulating very large numbers and

340
00:21:47.410 --> 00:21:48.243
that's what Babbage,

341
00:21:48.560 --> 00:21:50.390
<v 3>uh,
uh,</v>

342
00:21:50.690 --> 00:21:54.800
<v 0>designed it for.
And every single piece of the machine is to add,
subtract,</v>

343
00:21:54.801 --> 00:21:59.350
multiply,
divide large numbers as quickly as possible.
Um,

344
00:21:59.810 --> 00:22:02.600
the machine was not designed to produce a single result.

345
00:22:02.630 --> 00:22:07.630
It was designed to run through iterations of a formula to print out into books.

346
00:22:08.710 --> 00:22:11.330
Um,
so basically what you would have is,
you know,

347
00:22:11.331 --> 00:22:16.100
we need x formula for life insurance.
You know,

348
00:22:16.101 --> 00:22:21.101
what are the premiums if you're such and such an age and it would just run down

349
00:22:22.210 --> 00:22:26.720
and print for each success of age,
uh,
what the statistics are.
Um,

350
00:22:26.750 --> 00:22:28.490
that's the sort of thing this machine was for.

351
00:22:29.550 --> 00:22:30.383
<v 3>MMM.</v>

352
00:22:32.660 --> 00:22:35.690
<v 0>Each of these columns is a number,
um,</v>

353
00:22:36.080 --> 00:22:39.410
Babbage specified 50 digits for his ideal machine.

354
00:22:39.740 --> 00:22:44.740
So these are 50 gears and the way you store a number is you just turn each gear.

355
00:22:45.110 --> 00:22:49.040
So if you want to put 351,
you go three,
five,

356
00:22:49.220 --> 00:22:53.060
one places on each gear and you just go down.
Um,

357
00:22:53.090 --> 00:22:57.350
even I can understand that part.
So I'd say it's pretty straight forward,
um,

358
00:22:59.000 --> 00:23:02.720
as to how much storage he had.
Everyone wants more memory.

359
00:23:02.721 --> 00:23:06.530
I think Babbage said,
you know,
ideally a thousand places.

360
00:23:06.870 --> 00:23:09.620
Now you can see if I pop back to the design,

361
00:23:09.621 --> 00:23:11.630
he puts the memories sort of running off the page.

362
00:23:12.710 --> 00:23:17.170
So I'm sure he would have ideally added more and more memory to that,
um,

363
00:23:17.660 --> 00:23:22.070
and the memory and just goes off
into the distance.

364
00:23:22.700 --> 00:23:26.840
So I turn that off.
So each layer,

365
00:23:26.841 --> 00:23:31.310
all of that height is only because it's such big numbers that it's for.
Um,

366
00:23:32.630 --> 00:23:34.790
so the mass of the machinery is,

367
00:23:34.791 --> 00:23:38.930
is just replicating up the decimal places.
Um,

368
00:23:39.410 --> 00:23:42.440
so I'm just a,
this is just a very super,
super,

369
00:23:42.441 --> 00:23:46.780
super simplified demo with one,
which is quality here,
um,

370
00:23:49.050 --> 00:23:53.950
with one decimal place just to kind of go through,
um,
this amazing machine,
uh,

371
00:23:53.970 --> 00:23:55.560
because it's,
it's an absolute thing of beauty.

372
00:23:55.561 --> 00:23:59.850
And when you consider this was designed in 1830s and forties by a guy with,

373
00:23:59.910 --> 00:24:04.170
you know,
literally a feather and some and candles.

374
00:24:04.610 --> 00:24:09.340
Um,
it's pretty amazing because this was all held in his head.
Um,

375
00:24:11.420 --> 00:24:16.100
it took three types of card to run the machine,
a number card,

376
00:24:16.970 --> 00:24:20.720
variable card.
This is the addressing system basically.
Uh,

377
00:24:20.740 --> 00:24:25.640
and the operations card,
which has the program itself.
Um,
fortunately,

378
00:24:25.641 --> 00:24:27.350
very recently,
um,

379
00:24:28.220 --> 00:24:32.930
I had some lovely pictures sent to me by Bruce Sterling actually.
Um,
uh,

380
00:24:32.960 --> 00:24:35.870
who's into Rin and found,
um,

381
00:24:36.710 --> 00:24:38.820
some of the stuff that Babbage left when he gave his

382
00:24:38.870 --> 00:24:42.480
<v 2>talk there.
Um,
this is the number of cards sample that he left.</v>

383
00:24:42.690 --> 00:24:47.580
So this is pine written on the number of card and you can see the way the card

384
00:24:47.581 --> 00:24:49.700
is written.
Is that the important places?

385
00:24:49.730 --> 00:24:54.090
So three has three and punched holes.
Okay.

386
00:24:54.210 --> 00:24:55.043
<v 0>Um,</v>

387
00:24:55.980 --> 00:25:00.840
was an operations card come back to that in a sec.
But if you look at the,

388
00:25:00.930 --> 00:25:02.700
let's go,
if we go back to the number of card,

389
00:25:03.090 --> 00:25:07.620
the whole machine was built off of the principle of the jacquard loom.

390
00:25:07.970 --> 00:25:09.240
Um,
if you ever see one of those,

391
00:25:09.660 --> 00:25:13.680
all that that happens with the moon is that you have go to the,

392
00:25:16.310 --> 00:25:21.260
a number of cards over here.
So you'd have an array and you know,

393
00:25:21.261 --> 00:25:23.960
and a number card,
you'd have like 10,

394
00:25:24.200 --> 00:25:28.820
10 little leavers for 50 decimal places.
It's like 500 little leavers.

395
00:25:28.970 --> 00:25:33.560
This is actually not,
um,
a 500.
I didn't go that crazy with it,

396
00:25:33.561 --> 00:25:37.700
but um,
it would have been an extremely complicated machine.
Um,

397
00:25:37.760 --> 00:25:42.020
and the way it works is the um,
the card,

398
00:25:42.080 --> 00:25:44.750
the spindle pushes the card forward.
If there's a hole,

399
00:25:45.020 --> 00:25:48.500
it just goes through the lever and nothing happens.
If there's not a whole,

400
00:25:48.710 --> 00:25:53.710
then the leaver pushes forward and basically engages some part of the machine to

401
00:25:56.391 --> 00:26:01.391
the power underneath the machine or cams continually turning.

402
00:26:02.330 --> 00:26:06.770
I'm driven presumably by the steam engine that's puffing away and corner.
Um,

403
00:26:06.830 --> 00:26:07.641
and the lever,

404
00:26:07.641 --> 00:26:12.641
we'll just hook up something to the cam and it will go either up and down and

405
00:26:12.681 --> 00:26:15.440
round and round.
That's basically the two things that cam can do,

406
00:26:15.441 --> 00:26:19.310
but if you put them together in clever ways,
you can do some pretty good stuff.

407
00:26:21.120 --> 00:26:22.520
Um,
so that's how the cards work.

408
00:26:25.230 --> 00:26:30.120
The way the machine works is,
first thing that happens is the variable card,

409
00:26:30.121 --> 00:26:33.660
which I always called them address cards just because it's a lot clearer to me

410
00:26:33.661 --> 00:26:37.920
to think of this as the addressing system.
And this would have a whole,

411
00:26:38.130 --> 00:26:41.550
I presume for each position in the memory.

412
00:26:41.580 --> 00:26:46.230
So you would eventually a ginormous card unless you came up with some more

413
00:26:46.231 --> 00:26:48.360
clever system.
Um,

414
00:26:49.170 --> 00:26:51.900
and that just depresses the lever,

415
00:26:51.901 --> 00:26:55.320
which hooks up its corresponding section in the memory to a little opinion.

416
00:26:57.000 --> 00:26:58.020
Then the number card

417
00:27:00.210 --> 00:27:04.300
sort of red means it's driving green means it's bringing driven,
um,

418
00:27:04.320 --> 00:27:07.960
it's just a bit clearer to understand,
uh,
that way.
So,
um,

419
00:27:08.130 --> 00:27:12.880
then the number card we'll read
just by turning,

420
00:27:13.240 --> 00:27:17.740
all it does is just say turn three places to however many places there are no

421
00:27:17.741 --> 00:27:22.390
holes in this section.
So,
um,
that turns three places.

422
00:27:22.391 --> 00:27:26.170
So three,
the Rocco,
three places,
pinion goes three places,

423
00:27:26.350 --> 00:27:31.210
gear goes through places,
it's not reading.
Three,
um,
disengage.

424
00:27:31.540 --> 00:27:33.190
So then it reads in another number.

425
00:27:35.750 --> 00:27:40.400
Variable cards selects the address,
number card reads out a number into it.

426
00:27:40.890 --> 00:27:43.490
Um,
these cards are runs completely separately.

427
00:27:43.730 --> 00:27:46.160
So when you're setting up the program,

428
00:27:46.580 --> 00:27:50.390
you're wrangling three completely separate cars and you're really better hope

429
00:27:50.391 --> 00:27:53.220
that you've got them in the right order.
And then it was,
you've got those popups.

430
00:27:53.221 --> 00:27:55.540
So,
um,

431
00:27:57.440 --> 00:28:00.830
right now the operations card

432
00:28:02.660 --> 00:28:05.510
is to me where the real beauty of the machine is

433
00:28:07.450 --> 00:28:11.450
going to pop over to the operations card here.
Oh,
there we go.

434
00:28:12.170 --> 00:28:15.980
Um,
you can see here,
this is Babbage's on handwriting.
Um,

435
00:28:15.981 --> 00:28:20.570
he has all the functions add,
subtract,
multiply,
divide,

436
00:28:20.720 --> 00:28:25.490
systemic straighting a division.
Um,
it's also about these two holes.
Ad Rotation,

437
00:28:25.491 --> 00:28:26.570
subtract rotation.

438
00:28:26.930 --> 00:28:31.930
That means the machine could instruct itself to go back or forward depending on

439
00:28:33.230 --> 00:28:38.080
the state of the machine.
Um,
and I'll kind of explain how that works.

440
00:28:38.081 --> 00:28:38.914
So in a second.

441
00:28:40.710 --> 00:28:41.543
<v 3>Yeah.</v>

442
00:28:41.920 --> 00:28:46.780
<v 0>Um,
so how could you go through such a complex procedure with a single hole?</v>

443
00:28:47.230 --> 00:28:48.063
Um,

444
00:28:48.220 --> 00:28:53.220
because addition alone took several dozen steps of many,

445
00:28:53.381 --> 00:28:57.940
many different bits of machinery.
The way he did that is with the barrels.
Uh,

446
00:28:58.060 --> 00:29:01.930
which is funny because he actually took these from the barrel organs.

447
00:29:02.170 --> 00:29:06.230
I bet he hated so much.
Um,
but he must have loved that mechanism cause he,

448
00:29:06.231 --> 00:29:08.840
he stuck these barrels all over the place.
Uh,

449
00:29:09.730 --> 00:29:14.540
and the way that he uses them is that the operations card will say,
you know,

450
00:29:14.770 --> 00:29:15.101
add,

451
00:29:15.101 --> 00:29:20.101
let's say push forward and then the barrels will rotate to a wedge of

452
00:29:20.531 --> 00:29:23.910
instructions.
So all that,
uh,

453
00:29:24.070 --> 00:29:27.790
the add a position,
does it say,
go to the ad,

454
00:29:28.110 --> 00:29:31.990
a set of instructions.
Um,

455
00:29:32.080 --> 00:29:35.230
and what does that set up?

456
00:29:35.500 --> 00:29:37.960
The numbers that an ordered from the variable card.

457
00:29:39.520 --> 00:29:40.120
<v 3>Okay.</v>

458
00:29:40.120 --> 00:29:42.120
<v 0>Uh,
variable hooks up.
It's got</v>

459
00:29:42.130 --> 00:29:43.090
<v 3>its own barrel.
Any,</v>

460
00:29:43.091 --> 00:29:46.480
any of the cards are using barrels because they need to run through a bunch of

461
00:29:46.481 --> 00:29:49.760
stuff.
Sorry.
Um,

462
00:29:50.590 --> 00:29:55.240
and that reads off their designated address into the ingress access,

463
00:29:56.710 --> 00:30:00.090
uh,
which then reads it off into these wonderful wheels.
I love these things.
Uh,

464
00:30:00.100 --> 00:30:03.910
he got rid of these in the later,
um,
designs for the machine,

465
00:30:03.911 --> 00:30:05.200
which is sad cause I,

466
00:30:05.210 --> 00:30:09.610
I love the clarity of this sort of giant data transfer thing in the middle.

467
00:30:10.300 --> 00:30:14.710
Um,
so this will send,
uh,

468
00:30:14.740 --> 00:30:19.040
the number two,
this section,
each of these sections in the mill,
um,

469
00:30:19.490 --> 00:30:20.560
back to look at the,
uh,

470
00:30:22.440 --> 00:30:26.850
<v 0>so each of these sections is specialized earring.
Um,
and it's,</v>

471
00:30:26.851 --> 00:30:29.910
it's largely adding,
um,

472
00:30:30.000 --> 00:30:33.750
stuff but just special types of addition.
And it just says,
okay,

473
00:30:33.751 --> 00:30:38.590
go to the adding section.
Yeah.
So it feeds the one number in,

474
00:30:40.150 --> 00:30:44.720
picks up another number is that one in a,

475
00:30:44.730 --> 00:30:49.340
and then the barrels just go through their little routine.
Um,

476
00:30:49.341 --> 00:30:51.610
this obviously is a cartoon there.
There is,
these are really,

477
00:30:51.611 --> 00:30:54.460
really complicated bits of the bits of gear.
Um,

478
00:30:54.610 --> 00:30:57.880
but I just put this together for my own kind of in this nation.
Um,

479
00:30:58.360 --> 00:31:02.860
so they run through their instruction set.
There's the result,

480
00:31:04.780 --> 00:31:08.800
the variable cards select the address that they want the result to read out to.

481
00:31:09.670 --> 00:31:13.990
That's fed into the egress access.
Sir,
I'll put,
I guess we'd call it now,

482
00:31:17.810 --> 00:31:21.410
fair.
Bocard's pickup.
Uh,
you know,

483
00:31:21.470 --> 00:31:26.350
give the a where they want that to me too.
And that reads off and done.
Um,

484
00:31:26.720 --> 00:31:28.300
it had a very,
uh,

485
00:31:28.360 --> 00:31:32.140
although she's known kind of generally as the first programmer.

486
00:31:32.470 --> 00:31:36.790
That's not actually first of all true or second of all that critical.

487
00:31:37.150 --> 00:31:40.420
Obviously Babbage wrote programs for the machine when he was designing it.

488
00:31:40.960 --> 00:31:43.520
They're much simpler than that Bernoulli one,
uh,

489
00:31:43.540 --> 00:31:48.190
which he and Ada collaborated on,
which is in the paper.
Um,
but,

490
00:31:48.640 --> 00:31:49.280
uh,

491
00:31:49.280 --> 00:31:52.840
Babbage also had assistance that might have written some simple programs for it.

492
00:31:53.230 --> 00:31:57.340
Um,
so she wasn't the first and she wasn't kind of there at his elbow writing

493
00:31:57.341 --> 00:32:01.030
programs for him.
Um,
in any case,

494
00:32:01.031 --> 00:32:05.340
she herself complained a lot about their state tables.
When she wrote the papers.

495
00:32:05.341 --> 00:32:09.580
She was like,
this is a huge pain and it's really annoying and fiddly and,
uh,

496
00:32:09.581 --> 00:32:13.810
you know,
this is a McCount is stamina.
Um,

497
00:32:14.770 --> 00:32:15.410
what,
uh,

498
00:32:15.410 --> 00:32:19.840
it is the actual main interest in the machine was in connecting it with the

499
00:32:19.841 --> 00:32:24.460
ideas of this guy,
uh,
who was her mathematics tutor who's Augustus to Morgan.

500
00:32:25.210 --> 00:32:30.130
Um,
if you've heard of do Morgan's laws,
this is that to Morgan.
Um,

501
00:32:30.170 --> 00:32:32.490
Demorian basically took,
uh,
you know,

502
00:32:32.590 --> 00:32:36.670
through his university college London course,
um,

503
00:32:36.700 --> 00:32:39.650
which she had just started obviously as a woman she go,

504
00:32:39.920 --> 00:32:44.270
but he took her through it by correspondence.
Um,
he was a family friend.

505
00:32:44.720 --> 00:32:47.540
I'm not something they paid or anything like that.
They hung out,

506
00:32:47.570 --> 00:32:49.700
I guess you could say.
Um,

507
00:32:50.720 --> 00:32:55.640
and at the same time that love that was hanging out with Babbage.

508
00:32:55.641 --> 00:32:59.900
She was also hanging out with Morgan at the time that the Morgan was developing

509
00:32:59.901 --> 00:33:03.920
a mathematical system of logic.
This is 10 years before boule.

510
00:33:04.610 --> 00:33:09.200
Um,
you can see what Dee Dee Morgan's logic looks like here.

511
00:33:09.200 --> 00:33:13.580
He's trying to find a way to turn it into mathematical formulas.
Um,

512
00:33:14.060 --> 00:33:17.330
and for Lovelace,
she looked at this one

513
00:33:18.890 --> 00:33:19.920
click.
Uh,

514
00:33:20.600 --> 00:33:25.600
I think for lovelies being kind of in proximity with these two ideas in ferment

515
00:33:27.090 --> 00:33:32.090
of Babbage's machine for manipulating numbers and to Morgan's concept of logic

516
00:33:33.201 --> 00:33:36.170
as mathematics,
which was very,
very,
very new.
I mean,

517
00:33:36.290 --> 00:33:39.230
Morgan was really pretty much one of the first people who was doing this sort of

518
00:33:39.231 --> 00:33:44.090
thing.
Um,
this kind of led her pop up past that.

519
00:33:44.690 --> 00:33:47.720
Uh,
this is a two,
they're probably her most famous passage in the paper,

520
00:33:47.750 --> 00:33:52.700
which is to link the two together and say this is not necessarily a arithmetic

521
00:33:52.701 --> 00:33:54.130
machine.
This can be

522
00:33:54.280 --> 00:33:58.930
<v 2>logic machine.
Um,
she says,
uh,
the position holding its own,</v>

523
00:33:58.960 --> 00:34:03.070
um,
in enabling mechanism to combine together general symbols.

524
00:34:03.340 --> 00:34:07.810
She's Victorian.
So it takes a long time to get through a sentence.
Um,

525
00:34:07.990 --> 00:34:11.120
in six sessions,
I haven't limited variety and extent are uniting.

526
00:34:11.140 --> 00:34:14.980
Link is established between the operations of matter and the abstract mental

527
00:34:14.981 --> 00:34:17.260
processes at the most abstract branch of math,

528
00:34:17.590 --> 00:34:21.640
medical science and you vast and powerful language is developed for the future

529
00:34:21.641 --> 00:34:23.890
use of analysis.
Um,

530
00:34:25.050 --> 00:34:29.510
<v 0>she comes back to this idea again and again in the paper that,
um,
uh,</v>

531
00:34:29.580 --> 00:34:30.331
for example,

532
00:34:30.331 --> 00:34:35.331
she says if you took a musical composition and could find a way to develop it as

533
00:34:37.141 --> 00:34:38.760
a series of instructions,

534
00:34:39.300 --> 00:34:43.350
the machine could be taught to compose music,
scientific music.

535
00:34:43.351 --> 00:34:47.610
She says it can be taught to compose scientific music of unlimited variety and

536
00:34:47.611 --> 00:34:52.560
extent.
Um,
so for me,
looking at this,

537
00:34:52.590 --> 00:34:56.790
sorry,
this is a,
my a eight 11 is programming,
uh,
engine.
I,

538
00:34:56.830 --> 00:34:59.580
I'm always struck by how hard it must've been to keep the cars together.

539
00:34:59.581 --> 00:35:04.260
So designed for her a,
a kind of machine to do that.
Um,

540
00:35:04.890 --> 00:35:09.210
for me too,
it was only when I built this thing,

541
00:35:09.720 --> 00:35:13.500
um,
that I understood what a spectacular leap this was.
Um,

542
00:35:13.530 --> 00:35:18.070
there's nothing in this machine,
uh,
that would even suggest such a thing.
Uh,

543
00:35:18.390 --> 00:35:22.620
to me,
to me the,
and certainly to Babbage,
this is a machine for arithmetic,

544
00:35:22.890 --> 00:35:27.240
fast arithmetic in very large numbers in Babbage's obsession with speed is I

545
00:35:27.241 --> 00:35:32.160
guess a classic hardware guy from what I understand it in that [inaudible] most

546
00:35:32.161 --> 00:35:36.900
of the work that he put into it with to make it faster.
Um,

547
00:35:38.520 --> 00:35:43.520
but lovely Saudi connection with logic with this little bit here and that's the

548
00:35:43.741 --> 00:35:48.150
ad rotation,
subtract rotation instruction on those cards.
Um,

549
00:35:48.690 --> 00:35:51.600
Babish developed for that,
this little thing called the conditional arm.

550
00:35:52.770 --> 00:35:57.300
And that would drop down if when the machine hit say a certain result or certain

551
00:35:57.301 --> 00:36:01.080
level of results that it would then instruct the machine to stop,
for example,

552
00:36:01.290 --> 00:36:05.580
or branch to go a different,
uh,
to go to a different set of instructions.

553
00:36:06.570 --> 00:36:08.730
S let me see animation of that.
There we go.

554
00:36:09.510 --> 00:36:11.730
So while the barrels are going away,

555
00:36:11.731 --> 00:36:14.700
you can see if there's a peg

556
00:36:16.530 --> 00:36:20.670
and the arms in place.
Um,

557
00:36:20.730 --> 00:36:25.000
then it instructs the machine to do something different.
Um,

558
00:36:25.070 --> 00:36:29.840
and this is a logic.
This is an if and logic system.
Um,

559
00:36:29.910 --> 00:36:33.090
and it's this tiny piece here.
Um,

560
00:36:33.300 --> 00:36:37.210
I think that [inaudible] saw the possibilities of,
um,

561
00:36:37.350 --> 00:36:39.900
if you stripped away all the gears,
which,
you know,

562
00:36:40.080 --> 00:36:42.000
90% of the machine is just numbers.

563
00:36:42.360 --> 00:36:45.920
If you take that all away and you just look at this and you start thinking of

564
00:36:45.921 --> 00:36:49.890
what you can do with that,
um,
it's a pretty beautiful,
even to me,
uh,

565
00:36:49.920 --> 00:36:54.300
who hates computers,
just to remind you.
Um,
so,

566
00:36:54.301 --> 00:36:55.134
um,

567
00:36:55.350 --> 00:36:59.280
that's the barrels and the engine and it'll only central's damage and logic and

568
00:36:59.281 --> 00:37:02.490
everything.
So I think that's my talk.
Thank you.
