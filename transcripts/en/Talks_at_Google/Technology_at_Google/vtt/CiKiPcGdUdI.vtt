1
00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:09.000
I'm delighted to welcome you to the podium,
Frances West.

2
00:00:13.270 --> 00:00:15.970
Good morning.
Um,

3
00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:21.040
I want to thank Sarah for that introduction.
Uh,

4
00:00:21.041 --> 00:00:26.041
I also know Sarah from the past and it's great to see a collie and I'm at Google

5
00:00:27.811 --> 00:00:29.250
and that this is a very

6
00:00:31.620 --> 00:00:35.190
exciting day for me personally.
Like Sarah said,

7
00:00:35.191 --> 00:00:40.191
I spend quite a few years in IBM and my last job was a IBM's two vessels to be

8
00:00:40.921 --> 00:00:42.960
the officer.
Um,

9
00:00:42.990 --> 00:00:47.990
but now I have my own consulting company because my last job actually was

10
00:00:49.651 --> 00:00:54.270
probably the most meaningful job I ever had at IBM.
I,
um,

11
00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:59.400
I came to this topic about,
um,
human centric,

12
00:00:59.630 --> 00:01:04.140
um,
technology impact on Sosa,
future society.

13
00:01:04.950 --> 00:01:05.250
Uh,

14
00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:10.250
in my last job because I spend my entire years in IBM in the first two third of

15
00:01:12.871 --> 00:01:16.230
my lives really learning about technology,

16
00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:19.170
selling technology and market technology.

17
00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:24.800
And I'm just not until my last job in IBM research where my organization was,

18
00:01:26.431 --> 00:01:27.210
um,

19
00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:32.210
located that I realize this fundamental concept of diversity really brings

20
00:01:34.980 --> 00:01:38.490
disruptive innovation.
And many of you

21
00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:45.260
in this audience or outside in this attack community know that the topic of

22
00:01:46.441 --> 00:01:50.910
inclusion is a very,
very big topic.
Right?

23
00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:54.810
And uh,
but when it comes down to it,

24
00:01:55.140 --> 00:02:00.140
what I realize is that inclusion in many cases,

25
00:02:00.510 --> 00:02:02.670
at least in today's environment,

26
00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:08.000
a lot of times the cast as more of a HR human resource initiative and a lot of

27
00:02:09.451 --> 00:02:13.980
people talk about inclusion as a kind of um,

28
00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:18.440
consistent what we call the constituency topic,
you know,
gender,
race,
um,

29
00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:20.250
and so on or religion.

30
00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:26.120
But the way I look at diversity is that it really brings to bear the heart of

31
00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:28.613
innovation.

32
00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:34.520
And let me just give you a little bit of a history of by myself and give you a

33
00:02:34.831 --> 00:02:39.360
little bit of a journey of my personal kind of a growth in this area.

34
00:02:39.361 --> 00:02:43.920
And they share with you why I believe that diversity is the core of it.

35
00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:45.000
Disruptive Innovation.

36
00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:51.050
I was in the United States three years with the kind of a broken English.

37
00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:57.210
I went to a campus interview in Lexington,
Lexington,

38
00:02:57.211 --> 00:03:02.211
Kentucky with a manager by the name of frank fruit or sort just based on that

39
00:03:02.741 --> 00:03:07.690
name,
you can tell that it's kind of a German descent,
um,
name.

40
00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:13.500
And at that time I only had waitressing in a Chinese restaurant as my

41
00:03:14.770 --> 00:03:17.190
experience.
Um,

42
00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:20.720
I sit down in front of this frankly Frank Frazier,

43
00:03:20.770 --> 00:03:25.770
store manager for IBM and gave him what I thought my Chinese waitressing job

44
00:03:28.810 --> 00:03:32.230
will bring to my understanding of customer service.

45
00:03:32.830 --> 00:03:35.530
At the end of a one hour interview,
he said to me,

46
00:03:35.531 --> 00:03:38.170
Francis or then he asked me the very crucial question,

47
00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:43.150
do you have a green card or permanent residency?
I'm like,
no,
I don't,

48
00:03:43.630 --> 00:03:48.550
but I am going to marry while my brother caught a foreign devil.
Oh,

49
00:03:48.551 --> 00:03:52.180
by the way,
that's why I have a last name or west,

50
00:03:53.200 --> 00:03:56.980
far from being released.
Um,
so I said to him,

51
00:03:57.460 --> 00:04:01.640
I'm going to get a,
I'm going to marry a foreign dev or I didn't say that I,

52
00:04:01.641 --> 00:04:05.380
I'm going to meet her American,
I'm going to get my citizenship.

53
00:04:05.890 --> 00:04:09.970
And then so he said,
great,
Francis,
go get married.

54
00:04:10.750 --> 00:04:15.430
Have a nice honeymoon,
you have a job with IBM.
So this gentleman,

55
00:04:15.431 --> 00:04:20.431
frank store was the first person you might life that really practice what I call

56
00:04:21.611 --> 00:04:24.700
authentic inclusion in the sense that

57
00:04:26.220 --> 00:04:27.720
I hardly know English.

58
00:04:28.110 --> 00:04:33.110
I didn't have a green card and yet he believed in me or what I could become.

59
00:04:34.350 --> 00:04:37.530
I didn't even know what I could do at that time.
Anyway,

60
00:04:37.531 --> 00:04:41.010
that's how I started IBM career.
Um,

61
00:04:41.100 --> 00:04:45.300
in the next 20 some years.
Um,
I help IBM.

62
00:04:45.301 --> 00:04:49.110
So a cell mainframe for those of you who don't know what mainframe is,

63
00:04:49.440 --> 00:04:53.550
anybody watched the,
uh,
the movie hidden figures.

64
00:04:55.210 --> 00:04:56.710
Okay,
that's a mainframe.

65
00:04:57.040 --> 00:05:00.680
We worked on technology to put people out in the moon.

66
00:05:01.360 --> 00:05:06.250
We were down technology builder,
the American airline Saber system,

67
00:05:06.251 --> 00:05:09.310
which you still use today for a airline reservation.

68
00:05:09.730 --> 00:05:13.930
We build a system for social security administration.

69
00:05:14.170 --> 00:05:18.340
So at that time the technology was all about,

70
00:05:18.780 --> 00:05:21.730
um,
putting what we call the,
uh,

71
00:05:21.760 --> 00:05:25.450
infrastructure system or business system to be more effective,

72
00:05:25.690 --> 00:05:29.110
to be more efficient.
And I remember back then,

73
00:05:29.890 --> 00:05:32.080
the keyword as a systems engineer,

74
00:05:32.110 --> 00:05:37.090
I was trained to think about on behalf of the customer are three keywords,
Ras,

75
00:05:38.080 --> 00:05:40.330
Ras stands for reliability,

76
00:05:41.110 --> 00:05:43.780
availability and serviceability.

77
00:05:44.710 --> 00:05:49.710
So that was an era where the computer is all about system an optimization.

78
00:05:51.610 --> 00:05:55.910
And because of that,
uh,
kind of a knowledge and also,
um,

79
00:05:56.110 --> 00:05:56.943
a background.
I,

80
00:05:57.260 --> 00:06:02.260
I actually had the opportunity to be the first wave of IBM was the go to China

81
00:06:03.950 --> 00:06:06.140
in the mid nineties.
And one of my,

82
00:06:06.141 --> 00:06:11.141
I was still say my biggest accomplishment was actually helping the Chinese

83
00:06:11.511 --> 00:06:13.970
government to build the China payment system,

84
00:06:14.030 --> 00:06:17.630
which is the federal reserve equivalent of Interbank Clarence system.

85
00:06:17.810 --> 00:06:22.490
So we're talking about big system handling,
uh,

86
00:06:22.550 --> 00:06:26.480
at the beginning of the check processing and then what we call the payment

87
00:06:26.481 --> 00:06:31.100
infrastructure.
So all these are very exciting,

88
00:06:31.101 --> 00:06:34.790
you know,
um,
learning a profession,

89
00:06:34.791 --> 00:06:36.740
a professional growth and all that.

90
00:06:37.370 --> 00:06:42.370
And then I came back from a Chinese China assignment in the early 2000 I had the

91
00:06:44.301 --> 00:06:49.301
opportunity to join IBM research to help this organization call IBM human

92
00:06:50.631 --> 00:06:53.600
ability and assessability center.
And frankly,

93
00:06:53.601 --> 00:06:55.940
I knew very little about accessibility.

94
00:06:56.360 --> 00:06:59.780
How many of you here know about assessability?

95
00:07:01.630 --> 00:07:02.463
Okay,

96
00:07:02.710 --> 00:07:07.000
so for those of you who don't know us as ability in the technical world or the

97
00:07:07.040 --> 00:07:09.700
the technology or definition,
it's about,

98
00:07:09.760 --> 00:07:14.200
think of it in the ultimate objectivist has ability is about digital inclusion.

99
00:07:15.010 --> 00:07:20.010
Meaning you want to make sure that the technology solution or product or apps

100
00:07:21.011 --> 00:07:25.570
that you put out there,
that every human being on this planet can use it.

101
00:07:25.571 --> 00:07:26.404
Not just some,

102
00:07:27.100 --> 00:07:28.270
<v 1>but all right.</v>

103
00:07:28.510 --> 00:07:33.510
<v 0>When I say all I mean means people who are aging or people who has disabilities,</v>

104
00:07:34.900 --> 00:07:38.200
that disability can be vicious.
Unrelated,
could be hearing related,

105
00:07:38.560 --> 00:07:42.670
could be mobile mobility related,
and most important,
it could be cognitive,

106
00:07:42.671 --> 00:07:43.504
unrelated.

107
00:07:44.050 --> 00:07:49.050
So part of the job and the mission of our organization was to make sure that

108
00:07:50.051 --> 00:07:55.051
everything coming out of IBM at the time is as assessable as possible,

109
00:07:55.960 --> 00:08:00.220
first and foremost to our employees.
And then won't,

110
00:08:00.340 --> 00:08:04.810
because we want to eat your own dog food.
Once we make sure that our employee,

111
00:08:04.811 --> 00:08:08.600
you can be productive.
Actually,
uh,

112
00:08:08.601 --> 00:08:12.400
earlier you were saying it was,
um,
is a equity engineering.

113
00:08:13.750 --> 00:08:16.840
That's exactly the kind of a goal that we're striving for,

114
00:08:16.900 --> 00:08:21.900
which is there is parody and equity of everybody will come to work.

115
00:08:22.660 --> 00:08:27.580
And then we learned a lot about that process and then,

116
00:08:27.720 --> 00:08:31.720
uh,
and then was able to help our customer to become more accessible.

117
00:08:33.130 --> 00:08:35.260
So in that job,

118
00:08:36.010 --> 00:08:39.550
I thought for sure that I will do it for three years,

119
00:08:39.580 --> 00:08:41.650
which is kind of a track record.

120
00:08:41.651 --> 00:08:45.910
I had IBM at the time because you want to move on,

121
00:08:45.911 --> 00:08:50.290
you want to get promoted.
And even in big company I'm showing Google,
you know,

122
00:08:50.291 --> 00:08:54.790
you want to try different things,
um,
to,
to,
to widen your experience.

123
00:08:55.980 --> 00:09:00.060
Little did I know that that became,
started out to be a job,

124
00:09:00.690 --> 00:09:05.640
then became a career and then become a calling because for the first time I

125
00:09:05.641 --> 00:09:10.641
realized of all the Glamor I got from selling big systems to Chinese government

126
00:09:11.881 --> 00:09:14.150
and,
and installing,
um,

127
00:09:14.220 --> 00:09:17.990
cat cam system with Raytheon pair,

128
00:09:18.900 --> 00:09:19.620
you know,

129
00:09:19.620 --> 00:09:24.620
cannot compare to the satisfaction I got when I worked with a person with

130
00:09:25.201 --> 00:09:26.100
disabilities.

131
00:09:26.310 --> 00:09:31.080
And to see that how he or she can perform at work with the same kind of

132
00:09:31.081 --> 00:09:32.760
enthusiasm and productivity.

133
00:09:33.480 --> 00:09:36.750
So that is the essence of what this,

134
00:09:36.870 --> 00:09:39.240
what the disability center was about.

135
00:09:40.080 --> 00:09:43.950
And from there we really led the innovation.
Why?

136
00:09:44.370 --> 00:09:47.940
Because our staff inside IBM research,

137
00:09:47.941 --> 00:09:52.500
we actually have people with disabilities,
we have blind engineer,

138
00:09:52.770 --> 00:09:57.770
we have deaf scientists innovating and creating new solutions because every

139
00:10:01.260 --> 00:10:05.610
single day they have to deal with issues or challenges.

140
00:10:06.210 --> 00:10:11.210
And in many cases their perspective is so creative is so out of the box thinking

141
00:10:13.980 --> 00:10:16.410
that it just create a,

142
00:10:16.440 --> 00:10:19.200
what we call the disruptive kind of innovation.

143
00:10:21.070 --> 00:10:26.070
So that is what I personally not only saw what he experienced and uh,

144
00:10:28.301 --> 00:10:33.301
after working in this capacity and that became IBM chief accessibility officer.

145
00:10:34.770 --> 00:10:39.400
It is around 2016 timeframe and that we all know around 2016,

146
00:10:39.401 --> 00:10:43.570
frankly,
that was the beginning was a lot of uh,
talk about,
for example,

147
00:10:43.571 --> 00:10:47.950
the silicon valley diversity issues.
Right.

148
00:10:48.580 --> 00:10:51.520
And,
um,
and like I said personally,

149
00:10:51.521 --> 00:10:56.521
because my own journey I had the opportunity to experience one would say because

150
00:10:56.770 --> 00:10:59.170
I am at this point you probably know,

151
00:10:59.171 --> 00:11:04.171
can tell I am first generation non English speaking Chinese and woman in tech

152
00:11:06.760 --> 00:11:08.560
and also age over age 50.

153
00:11:08.680 --> 00:11:13.680
So I kind of checked the box of every inclusion criteria.

154
00:11:14.560 --> 00:11:19.360
So
just like the state farm insurance commercial,

155
00:11:20.380 --> 00:11:22.360
we know a few because we have seen a few.

156
00:11:22.810 --> 00:11:27.810
So for my personal perspective I felt like there is a tremendous amount of um,

157
00:11:30.190 --> 00:11:35.190
story needs to be told to really put the inclusion not just as an HR kind of uh,

158
00:11:38.480 --> 00:11:39.460
a perspective.

159
00:11:39.520 --> 00:11:44.520
It's not just about hiring but it's about innovation and that we are at the

160
00:11:45.850 --> 00:11:50.850
critical point in our history of technology that company like Google is Google.

161
00:11:54.580 --> 00:11:58.270
You guys are in the forefront of a technology innovation,

162
00:11:59.020 --> 00:12:02.500
really have to think about this topic very,

163
00:12:02.501 --> 00:12:07.501
very seriously and that you really have the capacity and also to a large extent,

164
00:12:09.881 --> 00:12:14.881
you're a responsibility to make sure the technology innovation from this point

165
00:12:15.641 --> 00:12:16.181
on and go,

166
00:12:16.181 --> 00:12:21.181
you forward has all human needs and all human wants into consideration.

167
00:12:23.650 --> 00:12:24.850
Now why do I say that?

168
00:12:25.630 --> 00:12:30.630
So earlier I talked about in my era of a computer or technology,

169
00:12:33.150 --> 00:12:37.300
we were focusing on system optimization where four kids down,

170
00:12:37.690 --> 00:12:42.420
like I said,
reliability,
service,
a availability and service,
Avila B.

171
00:12:43.290 --> 00:12:45.040
But in the past 10,
15 years,

172
00:12:45.041 --> 00:12:50.041
we all know that the technology has moved from a system optimization model to a

173
00:12:52.181 --> 00:12:57.160
personal optimization or personally experienced model.

174
00:12:58.060 --> 00:13:02.290
We're beginning to see the trend is especially the emergence of the mobile,

175
00:13:02.890 --> 00:13:05.620
right?
When mobile came onto the scene,

176
00:13:05.920 --> 00:13:10.920
I remember before mobile devices become prevalent to talk about accessibility

177
00:13:12.010 --> 00:13:16.190
was a very difficult topic.
You know,
you go up to a,
you know,

178
00:13:16.330 --> 00:13:19.190
25 year old,
you know,
um,

179
00:13:19.360 --> 00:13:24.360
fresh college Grad and you say you need to think about people who are aging

180
00:13:24.880 --> 00:13:28.340
somehow.
It just doesn't quite resonate,
right.
Cause they just want to code.

181
00:13:28.341 --> 00:13:31.600
They want to get things out.
They weren't,
they weren't fancy,
um,

182
00:13:31.660 --> 00:13:36.510
kind of a screen experience,
you know,
everything kind of a,
a flash and,

183
00:13:36.520 --> 00:13:41.140
and fly in and all that.
They don't think about how cognitively,

184
00:13:41.380 --> 00:13:45.790
kind of a confusing it could be for a person with disabilities or aging.

185
00:13:46.360 --> 00:13:49.120
But when the mobile phone came along,
you know,

186
00:13:49.121 --> 00:13:51.280
when I started talking to people and say,
you know what,

187
00:13:51.670 --> 00:13:55.630
the font size matters often people,
right?
Yeah.

188
00:13:56.380 --> 00:14:00.370
You know,
when it was too small,
fallen like size 11 or 12,

189
00:14:00.400 --> 00:14:05.080
I cannot see on my cell phone color contrast.
When you send in the song,

190
00:14:05.140 --> 00:14:06.850
if you don't have enough color contrast,

191
00:14:06.851 --> 00:14:11.851
you won't be able to read when you are on the go because mobile and now and oh

192
00:14:12.701 --> 00:14:17.650
well all the work,
uh,
everybody to be on the girl when you're at the airport,

193
00:14:17.680 --> 00:14:22.020
you know when you're listening on that conference call and there's a lot of

194
00:14:22.021 --> 00:14:26.200
ambient noise you cannot here,
wouldn't it be nice if you have captioning?

195
00:14:26.830 --> 00:14:27.880
So all of a sudden,

196
00:14:27.910 --> 00:14:32.910
all these fundamental assessability or human centric technology requirement

197
00:14:33.640 --> 00:14:38.640
becomes universally relevant because every one of us could have temporarily,

198
00:14:39.940 --> 00:14:42.040
or what I call situationally disabled.

199
00:14:43.390 --> 00:14:48.390
So with the technology coming into what I call the personalized experience and

200
00:14:49.931 --> 00:14:53.340
Google,
you guys actually lead some of the effort with a,

201
00:14:53.341 --> 00:14:58.341
your android platform and also your search engine affects every single person on

202
00:15:00.531 --> 00:15:01.220
the planet.

203
00:15:01.220 --> 00:15:05.780
I just saw a news that Google is trying to reenter China market.

204
00:15:06.500 --> 00:15:09.530
So that's another one,
1.6 billion people,

205
00:15:11.060 --> 00:15:15.830
one quarter of the,
uh,
of the population on earth.

206
00:15:16.310 --> 00:15:19.850
Or by the way,
do you know,
for example,
I talked about aging.

207
00:15:20.450 --> 00:15:25.250
Do you know that China by 20,
by 2025,

208
00:15:25.280 --> 00:15:30.050
we'll have over 360 million people over age 65.

209
00:15:30.950 --> 00:15:33.470
That's the entire population in the United States.

210
00:15:34.550 --> 00:15:39.550
I was just in China in March and I was invited to speak as the only,

211
00:15:40.340 --> 00:15:43.080
kind of a outside speaker,
um,

212
00:15:43.220 --> 00:15:47.900
to the Chinese companies like Alibaba,

213
00:15:48.050 --> 00:15:52.130
Baidu,
and Tencent on the topic of assessability.

214
00:15:52.910 --> 00:15:53.743
Now.

215
00:15:53.780 --> 00:15:58.780
Why would China talk about accessibility today in the United States?

216
00:16:00.440 --> 00:16:04.250
If you are progressive thinking companies like Google,

217
00:16:04.251 --> 00:16:05.780
like IBM in this case,

218
00:16:05.781 --> 00:16:09.110
Microsoft recently have done a lot of working assessability area,

219
00:16:09.470 --> 00:16:11.210
then you think about us as ability,

220
00:16:11.211 --> 00:16:16.010
not as a compliance topic by lot of companies today,

221
00:16:16.250 --> 00:16:21.250
because United States a litigious society and because we have American

222
00:16:21.741 --> 00:16:25.220
disability act,
lot of technologists,

223
00:16:25.221 --> 00:16:30.221
their first experience with accessibility is a tie to ada section 508

224
00:16:31.731 --> 00:16:32.540
compliance.

225
00:16:32.540 --> 00:16:37.540
How many of you know of the legislation of Ada that apply to digital as

226
00:16:38.401 --> 00:16:41.820
disability?
Not many.

227
00:16:42.630 --> 00:16:43.463
Let me tell you,

228
00:16:43.590 --> 00:16:47.490
this is a trend and this is phenomenon that's not going to go away.

229
00:16:47.610 --> 00:16:49.050
So in the United States,

230
00:16:49.290 --> 00:16:53.730
if you are a government procurement company,

231
00:16:53.910 --> 00:16:55.290
which I think Google is,
right?

232
00:16:55.291 --> 00:16:58.050
If you want a big federal government business like department,

233
00:16:58.590 --> 00:17:03.590
Department of Defense or NASA or a social security or veterans affair,

234
00:17:05.130 --> 00:17:07.260
if you want to be a federal contractor,

235
00:17:07.500 --> 00:17:10.500
you must prove that your product is assessable.

236
00:17:11.670 --> 00:17:14.670
European Union just passed a similar law.

237
00:17:15.270 --> 00:17:18.210
China has the same procurement law in the baking's,

238
00:17:18.690 --> 00:17:23.690
so out of 146 countries in the world who signed the UN Convention on the rights

239
00:17:24.151 --> 00:17:25.200
of people disability,

240
00:17:25.440 --> 00:17:30.440
which was a PSAP establish a two oh six people would tell you this human rights

241
00:17:32.370 --> 00:17:35.580
convention of un,
it's equivalent.

242
00:17:35.940 --> 00:17:40.940
The importance is equivalent to the Kyoto Treaty on the green movement.

243
00:17:44.140 --> 00:17:49.140
United States actually let the entire effort of human rights as we are,

244
00:17:51.480 --> 00:17:55.500
I think we can agree and Ada American disability.

245
00:17:55.501 --> 00:18:00.380
I actually set the goal standard for digital accessibility,

246
00:18:00.720 --> 00:18:05.720
but the fact that a we are not a member of UN convention over time is going to

247
00:18:07.771 --> 00:18:10.530
erode our leadership.
Why do I know that?

248
00:18:10.590 --> 00:18:15.590
I was very fortunate to represent the entire it industry to testify in front of

249
00:18:16.111 --> 00:18:20.880
the u s Senate on this particular topic and it breaks my heart that we weren't

250
00:18:20.881 --> 00:18:23.760
able to get the United States Congress.

251
00:18:23.940 --> 00:18:28.940
We were six votes short in getting this ratified as other hundred 46 countries,

252
00:18:30.750 --> 00:18:31.830
but that said,

253
00:18:32.880 --> 00:18:37.880
the digital inclusion standards and digital inclusion future at this point is

254
00:18:39.511 --> 00:18:43.830
still set by the u s company like Google.
Like Facebook,

255
00:18:44.220 --> 00:18:45.053
like apple.

256
00:18:45.900 --> 00:18:50.900
And that's one of the reason why this topic is so important because from this

257
00:18:53.071 --> 00:18:53.701
point on,

258
00:18:53.701 --> 00:18:58.701
we all know that technology is not just system optimization effects every single

259
00:18:59.791 --> 00:19:03.770
person on this planet.
And when I say every single person,
I mean,

260
00:19:03.771 --> 00:19:06.660
and I don't mean the w the 1% or the 10%,

261
00:19:06.990 --> 00:19:11.220
I mean the entire stack including the base of the pyramid.

262
00:19:11.850 --> 00:19:16.430
So
in this today's kind of a,

263
00:19:16.440 --> 00:19:18.960
an equivalent of what I said,

264
00:19:19.020 --> 00:19:24.020
there are the Ras for the mainstream and my a mainframe computers today we

265
00:19:25.591 --> 00:19:29.190
should be talking about and we are talking about for example,

266
00:19:30.600 --> 00:19:35.460
um,
kind of a computer impact in the terms of privacy,

267
00:19:35.970 --> 00:19:39.960
right?
Security.
Cause these affects every person.

268
00:19:40.380 --> 00:19:45.380
And I will argue that assessability should be part of that discussion.

269
00:19:45.990 --> 00:19:49.410
So therefore it's Psa,
privacy,

270
00:19:49.530 --> 00:19:51.390
security and accessibility.

271
00:19:51.960 --> 00:19:56.550
Because if you truly a view believe that your solution,

272
00:19:56.551 --> 00:20:01.440
whether you are a programmer,
your engineer,
your designer,

273
00:20:03.690 --> 00:20:05.160
whatever you're making,

274
00:20:05.430 --> 00:20:10.430
if you want that product or services or solution or apps to be made available to

275
00:20:13.231 --> 00:20:18.231
every human being and you should have every human being as your objective,

276
00:20:19.800 --> 00:20:23.640
then you have to think human centric.
You have to think,

277
00:20:24.150 --> 00:20:29.150
what can I do on a day to day basis to make this a reality?

278
00:20:30.300 --> 00:20:34.650
A lot of people talk about inclusion and they will say,

279
00:20:34.680 --> 00:20:36.690
this is a topic.
The management,

280
00:20:36.720 --> 00:20:41.610
you know at the top should set the Sanders,
set the leadership.

281
00:20:43.050 --> 00:20:45.930
And like I said,
for my experience,

282
00:20:45.960 --> 00:20:50.960
inclusion is everybody's responsibility is specially when it comes down to

283
00:20:51.071 --> 00:20:55.930
digital inclusion.
Because if you go around,
he asked people and say,

284
00:20:55.990 --> 00:21:00.400
do you believe that everybody should be equal?
Everybody will say,
of course.

285
00:21:01.120 --> 00:21:02.320
And if you go around and say,

286
00:21:02.321 --> 00:21:06.820
do you want your product to be only available to some people?
Not all people,

287
00:21:07.270 --> 00:21:08.560
everybody was saying no.

288
00:21:10.450 --> 00:21:15.010
So principally everybody agree that this is the right thing to do.

289
00:21:15.520 --> 00:21:20.270
But when it comes into practice,
people will say,

290
00:21:20.320 --> 00:21:24.770
I'll average,
believe me,
I've heard all kinds of excuses.
Oh my budget is,

291
00:21:25.390 --> 00:21:25.700
is,

292
00:21:25.700 --> 00:21:30.700
is does not allow me to do this or is not part of our department's priority.

293
00:21:32.700 --> 00:21:37.700
So there are all kinds of potential obstacle put in front of you.

294
00:21:38.910 --> 00:21:41.460
But on the other hand,
as an individual,

295
00:21:41.760 --> 00:21:43.950
you actually can make a difference.

296
00:21:44.310 --> 00:21:47.310
You can actually be the person,

297
00:21:47.460 --> 00:21:51.960
make a conscious decision whether this is the authentic inclusion decision

298
00:21:51.961 --> 00:21:55.680
you're going to make as you go about your daily business.

299
00:21:56.310 --> 00:22:01.310
So this is one of the kind of a principal I'm thinking about authentic inclusion

300
00:22:03.810 --> 00:22:08.550
that I would like to share with you and that at this,

301
00:22:08.551 --> 00:22:12.510
again,
in this particular time,
all of us,

302
00:22:13.050 --> 00:22:18.030
you know,
have this kind of responsibility,
especially in the technology area,

303
00:22:18.060 --> 00:22:21.300
because technology is going to be,
it's not going to be,

304
00:22:21.301 --> 00:22:24.870
it's already pervasive in every person's life.

305
00:22:25.500 --> 00:22:30.500
And can you imagine if your technology has quan call embedded,

306
00:22:31.960 --> 00:22:35.880
you know,
discriminatory kind of a feature or function,

307
00:22:36.150 --> 00:22:38.760
not by design,
not by intention,
what,

308
00:22:38.761 --> 00:22:41.400
by lack of attention that could happen.

309
00:22:42.420 --> 00:22:47.420
So this is really what we're talking about is that how can a company like Google

310
00:22:48.091 --> 00:22:53.091
and how can the individual as a Googler you along with other technology

311
00:22:54.870 --> 00:22:59.870
companies together in calming to understand the impact of your behavior and your

312
00:23:02.491 --> 00:23:07.491
action on a day to day basis and the how a company can enable you all to do

313
00:23:08.221 --> 00:23:09.054
this.

314
00:23:09.190 --> 00:23:13.990
And the final point I want to make is that this is a topic that really goes

315
00:23:13.991 --> 00:23:16.450
beyond what we call the inclusion.

316
00:23:17.110 --> 00:23:19.750
This is a topic about putting human first,

317
00:23:20.020 --> 00:23:23.320
putting human in the middle of all your thinking.

318
00:23:23.680 --> 00:23:26.740
And as you design,
as you think about everything,

319
00:23:27.500 --> 00:23:31.120
and it's also not a just an idea,

320
00:23:31.390 --> 00:23:33.880
but as an institution,
if you are a manager,

321
00:23:34.720 --> 00:23:39.720
you actually have the capability to what I call institutionalize the thinking.

322
00:23:40.780 --> 00:23:45.070
When I was at IBM,
we actually take this topic and then make it a very,

323
00:23:46.250 --> 00:23:50.650
in that we have design camps,
we have,
you know,
um,

324
00:23:50.960 --> 00:23:53.360
development,
agile,
our processes.

325
00:23:53.720 --> 00:23:58.720
We have a communication from our marketing department involved in this because

326
00:23:59.270 --> 00:24:04.270
this has to be a kind of a central nucleus of accompanies the Ethel to believe

327
00:24:06.201 --> 00:24:11.201
in that you as an individual and all also you as a company in the technology

328
00:24:11.391 --> 00:24:16.391
forefront can impact the society and can also do the kind of equity computing

329
00:24:19.430 --> 00:24:21.260
like we were talking about earlier.

330
00:24:21.800 --> 00:24:26.240
So this is really the foundational of the,
of the thinking.

331
00:24:26.241 --> 00:24:30.980
And I can share a lot of the kind of an institutional practice examples,

332
00:24:31.280 --> 00:24:33.410
but I,
at this point,
you know,

333
00:24:33.411 --> 00:24:38.411
with this audience and perhaps I can open up for questions and then we can't

334
00:24:38.421 --> 00:24:41.330
have a more of a dialogue instead of me,
you know,

335
00:24:41.390 --> 00:24:45.350
giving you more of a kind of a,
um,

336
00:24:45.510 --> 00:24:50.000
a practice perspective.
So any,
uh,
any question that you may have.

337
00:24:51.350 --> 00:24:52.183
Yes.

338
00:24:54.100 --> 00:24:58.870
<v 2>So designing a product for like the whole spectrum of populations is really
hard.</v>

339
00:24:59.290 --> 00:25:03.850
So to you all it,
does IBM have any framework that could help people make

340
00:25:04.430 --> 00:25:06.950
<v 0>that happened?
Well,
the,</v>

341
00:25:07.250 --> 00:25:11.630
we actually have what we call the design language and thinking,

342
00:25:11.660 --> 00:25:14.150
and one of the things that I actually wanted to talk about,

343
00:25:14.480 --> 00:25:18.260
it's very hard to do as ability to by itself because you have separate that al.

344
00:25:18.261 --> 00:25:19.970
This seems to be extra effort.

345
00:25:20.360 --> 00:25:25.360
So what we did is that we work with our design team and got a lot of the concept

346
00:25:26.181 --> 00:25:30.980
built into the design thinking.
I mean,
Google must have a standard design

347
00:25:32.660 --> 00:25:36.580
process.
No.
When your product comes out,

348
00:25:36.590 --> 00:25:41.540
do you go through certain kind of um,
testing and,

349
00:25:41.541 --> 00:25:46.190
and,
and all that.
Okay.
Yes sir.

350
00:25:46.550 --> 00:25:50.620
Well,
maybe over time,
maybe this is something you used to think about,
right?

351
00:25:50.621 --> 00:25:53.180
I mean,
so what we did is that a four,
um,

352
00:25:53.330 --> 00:25:58.330
we know that Harway remember in our case we have hardware developers,

353
00:25:58.341 --> 00:26:02.450
we have software developer will have services.
So it's very diverse portfolio.

354
00:26:02.900 --> 00:26:07.400
But what we did is we kind of create a functional guidance,

355
00:26:08.090 --> 00:26:09.470
think of it as a checklist.

356
00:26:09.680 --> 00:26:14.680
So as any a developer go through what we call the concept design a plan and

357
00:26:16.341 --> 00:26:18.710
design and implement stage.

358
00:26:19.040 --> 00:26:24.040
We have a checklist for people to kind of use as a guidance is started out to be

359
00:26:24.741 --> 00:26:27.200
a paper checklist.
And then,
um,

360
00:26:27.320 --> 00:26:32.320
then we move on to automated checklist and now frankly we're using AI and based

361
00:26:32.751 --> 00:26:35.060
on what the person's creating,

362
00:26:35.510 --> 00:26:38.630
we actually can have AI to give,
um,

363
00:26:39.060 --> 00:26:43.740
kind of prompters and oh,
by the way,
all of these are based on standards,
right?

364
00:26:43.770 --> 00:26:45.720
Earlier I talked about his disability.

365
00:26:45.960 --> 00:26:50.960
This is another thing as disability is not kind of a liberal left weighing kind

366
00:26:52.981 --> 00:26:57.240
of a philosophy in the digital technology,

367
00:26:57.241 --> 00:26:58.860
digital inclusion space.

368
00:26:59.160 --> 00:27:03.750
This is actually a highly disciplined and regimented space in that we have

369
00:27:03.751 --> 00:27:08.751
standards call wet cat 2.0 or it stands for a web accessibility accessibility

370
00:27:11.191 --> 00:27:15.480
guideline,
which is came out of a w three c,
you know,

371
00:27:15.540 --> 00:27:17.400
a worldwide web standards group.

372
00:27:17.760 --> 00:27:20.580
So these are published standards that,

373
00:27:20.790 --> 00:27:23.310
remember I mentioned 146 countries.

374
00:27:24.030 --> 00:27:28.560
Every country is in the process adopting that standard.

375
00:27:28.561 --> 00:27:31.110
Just like today in the telco world,

376
00:27:31.260 --> 00:27:34.050
everybody's moving to five g for example,
right?

377
00:27:34.150 --> 00:27:38.700
There is a certain certain sets of,
uh,
uh,
of a technology standards.

378
00:27:38.701 --> 00:27:42.810
So between worldwide web,
between Itu,

379
00:27:43.050 --> 00:27:46.050
between these global ISO standards,

380
00:27:46.490 --> 00:27:50.850
there's there assessability center just like privacy standard and the security

381
00:27:50.851 --> 00:27:54.870
standards that are,
are,
are coming together.
So again,

382
00:27:55.590 --> 00:27:58.710
Google as a leader in this kind of technology,

383
00:27:58.711 --> 00:28:03.711
you all actually have the capability to be a leader in terms of,

384
00:28:04.471 --> 00:28:05.101
for example,

385
00:28:05.101 --> 00:28:10.101
maybe using your artificial intelligence capability to integrate all these

386
00:28:11.700 --> 00:28:13.830
elements into um,

387
00:28:14.370 --> 00:28:17.430
into maybe a AI AI based tool to,

388
00:28:17.470 --> 00:28:21.450
to lessen the burden of developers.
Does that make sense?

389
00:28:23.130 --> 00:28:27.970
So that's to some degree also,
um,
the what,

390
00:28:27.980 --> 00:28:32.980
what I mean by authentic inclusion framework that is inclusion should not just

391
00:28:34.771 --> 00:28:38.610
be a buzz word or a statement or an idea.

392
00:28:39.180 --> 00:28:43.560
You can and you should have organization constructs such as,

393
00:28:44.580 --> 00:28:45.031
you know,

394
00:28:45.031 --> 00:28:50.031
design criterias such as development standards such as testing protocols.

395
00:28:52.410 --> 00:28:56.580
Another thing that our,
I don't know whether Google does or not,
but if you don't,

396
00:28:56.581 --> 00:28:58.050
I highly recommend it,

397
00:28:58.380 --> 00:29:02.190
is that you actually have people with,

398
00:29:02.460 --> 00:29:03.450
for example,

399
00:29:03.510 --> 00:29:07.770
cognitive challenge or vision challenge as part of your testing team.

400
00:29:08.490 --> 00:29:13.490
Nothing like a real user that will humble you and also give you potentially out

401
00:29:15.001 --> 00:29:18.900
of the box thinking.
And also a solution.

402
00:29:19.770 --> 00:29:23.910
Like I mentioned,
I was in,
in China in March.
Um,

403
00:29:24.960 --> 00:29:29.960
China actually just started the assessability journey less than 10 years ago.

404
00:29:31.200 --> 00:29:36.200
So at that time I actually help translate Chinese or the word accessibility into

405
00:29:37.291 --> 00:29:40.260
Chinese because the Chinese,
the Astra is my native language.

406
00:29:41.020 --> 00:29:44.350
So 10 years ago,
you're looking at a country,
deny,

407
00:29:44.360 --> 00:29:46.930
even have the word assessability

408
00:29:48.430 --> 00:29:52.210
10 years now,
when I went back in March,

409
00:29:53.830 --> 00:29:54.910
it was a,
uh,

410
00:29:54.911 --> 00:29:59.911
forum sharing best practices from Baidu,

411
00:30:01.060 --> 00:30:02.930
Tencent,
Alibaba,

412
00:30:03.550 --> 00:30:08.550
and the most impressive and financial anybody heard of and financial

413
00:30:11.130 --> 00:30:15.720
and the financial is part of Ali Baba.
Everybody know Ali Baba?

414
00:30:16.770 --> 00:30:21.330
Okay?
So,
and financial,
think of it as Adi.

415
00:30:21.420 --> 00:30:25.980
Everybody know Ali pay.
Ali Pay was equivalent to apple pay,
right?

416
00:30:26.190 --> 00:30:31.190
So Ali Baba has created this entire ecommerce platform with a payment system.

417
00:30:32.520 --> 00:30:37.520
And financial is their mobile fintech platform.

418
00:30:39.210 --> 00:30:42.210
So if you Google,

419
00:30:42.360 --> 00:30:47.250
if you Google and financial there in the press every day,

420
00:30:47.251 --> 00:30:51.300
some people would be saying some Fintech,
you know,
Fintech,

421
00:30:51.301 --> 00:30:56.100
financial technology is going to huge,
huge transformation.

422
00:30:56.101 --> 00:30:58.350
And a lot of banks,
you know,

423
00:30:58.380 --> 00:31:01.980
are actually worry about their existence 10 years from now.
Right.

424
00:31:01.981 --> 00:31:06.690
Cause you got all the disruptors,
new type of a fintech companies coming in.

425
00:31:07.350 --> 00:31:11.640
So in financial actually had,
um,

426
00:31:13.110 --> 00:31:17.640
when they announced her,
uh,
a mobile APP was,
was,
is inaccessible.

427
00:31:18.240 --> 00:31:21.780
So somebody complained,
does a social media network is very,

428
00:31:21.781 --> 00:31:24.780
very strong in China as well because everybody has a mobile phone.

429
00:31:25.350 --> 00:31:29.430
So what happened was that a kind of a went viral.

430
00:31:29.580 --> 00:31:34.280
So what did an do in a financial,
do they immediately hired,
um,

431
00:31:35.220 --> 00:31:38.550
a team,
a person with disabilities,
blindness,

432
00:31:38.760 --> 00:31:43.760
aging and all that and made them a permanent part of their design team and also

433
00:31:45.151 --> 00:31:50.070
their testing team?
No.
Again,
in China,
they don't have any laws.

434
00:31:50.071 --> 00:31:53.700
They don't have Ada,
they don't,
they don't have anything to say.
You must do this.

435
00:31:54.060 --> 00:31:57.260
But as a company,
I mean China Rhinos.

436
00:31:57.270 --> 00:31:59.850
So consumer driven is unbelievable.

437
00:31:59.880 --> 00:32:03.750
Talk about a focus on customer experience.

438
00:32:03.900 --> 00:32:07.800
So the best practice there was shared by an financial,

439
00:32:07.950 --> 00:32:09.090
it's the entire,

440
00:32:09.091 --> 00:32:14.091
what we call the customer journey end to end and how they're embedding user

441
00:32:16.291 --> 00:32:17.730
experience.
In this case,

442
00:32:17.731 --> 00:32:21.900
particularly aging people with disability into the entire process.

443
00:32:22.140 --> 00:32:23.880
And I remember sitting,
I'll stage,

444
00:32:23.940 --> 00:32:28.940
I remember I was the only outside quote unquote expert and when I was listening

445
00:32:28.981 --> 00:32:32.760
to them like,
oh my God,
they are like not only they get it,

446
00:32:32.850 --> 00:32:37.650
they are actually surpassing frankly a lot of the companies doing here in the

447
00:32:37.651 --> 00:32:38.484
United States.

448
00:32:38.820 --> 00:32:43.820
So reason I'm sharing this with you is because this is not your father's

449
00:32:44.511 --> 00:32:46.250
assessability topic anymore.

450
00:32:46.251 --> 00:32:50.480
This is not about just making compliance and making Ada,
you know,

451
00:32:50.481 --> 00:32:53.110
so Google can uh,
can,

452
00:32:53.330 --> 00:32:58.010
can be a less a federal government contractor.
That's me minimum.

453
00:32:59.990 --> 00:33:04.460
I'm here to talk to you about this is if you believe that everybody's going to

454
00:33:04.461 --> 00:33:06.610
use technology,
you know,

455
00:33:06.740 --> 00:33:11.740
like mobile fall as part of their living as part of their working as part of

456
00:33:13.641 --> 00:33:14.474
their plane,

457
00:33:14.890 --> 00:33:19.890
it's every single activity that human does is going to involve technology.

458
00:33:21.470 --> 00:33:26.470
Then you must think of accessibility as part of that experience because

459
00:33:28.010 --> 00:33:31.880
ultimately accessibility is about extreme personalization.

460
00:33:32.660 --> 00:33:37.250
It's not that that person's disabled,
it's just my eyesight is not that good.

461
00:33:37.290 --> 00:33:40.130
Especially when I'm driving.

462
00:33:40.131 --> 00:33:43.310
You're not supposed to look at your phone,

463
00:33:43.550 --> 00:33:45.720
but you still have emailed and things coming in.

464
00:33:46.220 --> 00:33:50.570
At that point I would like my screen voice over to come on,

465
00:33:50.600 --> 00:33:53.960
just talk to me.
Right?
So this is becoming,

466
00:33:53.961 --> 00:33:57.080
think of it as a personal preference.
Again,

467
00:33:57.110 --> 00:34:02.110
put the human first thinking cap on and don't think of this as meetings are

468
00:34:03.441 --> 00:34:06.050
minimum,
you know,
compliance.

469
00:34:06.230 --> 00:34:10.460
But think about how can I make my product,
my services?

470
00:34:10.580 --> 00:34:15.580
How can I make the company Google to be the human first company that I think

471
00:34:17.181 --> 00:34:21.050
about the human experience.
And then I'd build,
you know,

472
00:34:21.260 --> 00:34:24.110
things around that human experience.

473
00:34:24.230 --> 00:34:29.230
I built it for the human experience and that is to me a true leaders,

474
00:34:30.080 --> 00:34:31.730
um,
action.

475
00:34:32.120 --> 00:34:37.120
And if you do so then all the other things including inclusion we'll come about

476
00:34:38.871 --> 00:34:43.871
naturally organically than you are now going out to hire a woman because you're

477
00:34:44.511 --> 00:34:47.090
supposed to hire a woman.
You're not out hiring a,

478
00:34:47.280 --> 00:34:51.650
a blind person because you are supposed to hire person disability and so on and

479
00:34:51.651 --> 00:34:52.484
so forth.

480
00:34:52.820 --> 00:34:57.820
Because what you believe fundamentally then is that technology's here to stay,

481
00:34:58.880 --> 00:35:00.140
not only here to stay,

482
00:35:00.141 --> 00:35:05.060
technology is going to be an integral part of every human exist existence.

483
00:35:05.690 --> 00:35:09.590
I mean,
we didn't talk about Ai,
artificial intelligence and all that,

484
00:35:11.210 --> 00:35:13.700
but if you start carry on,
you know,

485
00:35:13.701 --> 00:35:16.370
do extrapolation where the technology's going,

486
00:35:16.910 --> 00:35:21.910
it's going to be everything we do in everything we think was that I have the

487
00:35:22.521 --> 00:35:27.230
opportunity to be at the conference in San Paulo,

488
00:35:27.350 --> 00:35:31.940
Brazil with Vint cerf your own right then.

489
00:35:31.941 --> 00:35:36.860
And I were talking about jobs of the future.
He certainly,

490
00:35:37.830 --> 00:35:42.090
man invented the Internet.
So he talked about how he view,

491
00:35:42.420 --> 00:35:47.420
you all know vins vision now is this people centered Internet,

492
00:35:48.990 --> 00:35:52.170
right?
So Internet fall,

493
00:35:52.171 --> 00:35:56.220
his perspective has kind of gone away from the original purpose of serving

494
00:35:56.221 --> 00:36:00.840
people too.
So he's having this Pci people center,

495
00:36:00.841 --> 00:36:02.670
Internet kind of.
Um,

496
00:36:02.980 --> 00:36:07.230
Vishen and I'm coming in from my,

497
00:36:07.350 --> 00:36:12.250
my kind of VA,
uh,
pragmatic,
um,

498
00:36:12.540 --> 00:36:15.030
operational,
uh,

499
00:36:15.150 --> 00:36:18.750
experience in managing Ibm's,

500
00:36:19.400 --> 00:36:21.500
his abilities,
um,

501
00:36:21.840 --> 00:36:26.840
organization and seeing how by thinking human first and by people having

502
00:36:29.851 --> 00:36:34.851
diversity on my team and also throughout the IBM design team,

503
00:36:34.891 --> 00:36:35.940
Ibm Development Team,

504
00:36:36.180 --> 00:36:40.320
how that actually differentiated us as a company in terms of a product and

505
00:36:40.321 --> 00:36:45.030
services and most importantly a culture.
Right?

506
00:36:45.090 --> 00:36:50.090
It's because I w I would tell you that I would say the last point I want to make

507
00:36:50.401 --> 00:36:54.810
is that
one of the things I always,
uh,
when I,

508
00:36:54.840 --> 00:36:57.080
when I was a,
um,
on that,

509
00:36:57.180 --> 00:37:01.950
on that day and was sharing is that everybody in the technology business is

510
00:37:01.951 --> 00:37:05.820
about innovation.
We all know that if you don't have any innovation,
you die.

511
00:37:06.810 --> 00:37:09.960
I mean,
he's just fact facts of life,
right?

512
00:37:10.320 --> 00:37:15.320
So how do you make sure you have continuous innovation that's transformative,

513
00:37:15.901 --> 00:37:18.480
that's disruptive,
right?

514
00:37:18.900 --> 00:37:21.480
And if you look at history of a company right now,

515
00:37:21.481 --> 00:37:25.320
Ibm I think is the only company that has over a hundred years of reinventing

516
00:37:25.321 --> 00:37:28.950
itself.
Then you pew bag,
you said,
what is the secret sauce?

517
00:37:28.951 --> 00:37:33.951
What is the thing that's make this company at least so far sustain,

518
00:37:35.010 --> 00:37:37.680
you know,
wave and wave is of a,

519
00:37:37.681 --> 00:37:42.681
of innovation fundamentally is this believe in diversity.

520
00:37:43.920 --> 00:37:45.600
So Google,

521
00:37:45.720 --> 00:37:49.050
you are in the tech world,

522
00:37:50.070 --> 00:37:51.720
the undisputed leader.

523
00:37:52.200 --> 00:37:57.200
And so therefore as a company actually Google along with you know,

524
00:37:59.040 --> 00:38:03.810
um,
uh,
Microsoft and apple,
all the technology company,

525
00:38:04.200 --> 00:38:09.200
we owe it to the world frankly to kind of not only promote but deliver some of

526
00:38:11.701 --> 00:38:15.990
the fundamental promise of technology,

527
00:38:15.991 --> 00:38:20.991
which is technology supposed to equalize access.

528
00:38:21.990 --> 00:38:26.990
Technologist supposed to create a democracy and technology should have a

529
00:38:27.961 --> 00:38:28.794
purpose.

530
00:38:29.310 --> 00:38:33.750
And that's what we all have as the opportunity in front of us.

531
00:38:34.110 --> 00:38:38.410
And that's why when Sarah told me that I,
that there,
you know,

532
00:38:38.411 --> 00:38:40.360
there's an opportunity to speak at Google,

533
00:38:40.630 --> 00:38:45.630
I jump at it right away because I sincerely believe that in this particular

534
00:38:46.631 --> 00:38:47.950
timing,
our history,

535
00:38:48.670 --> 00:38:53.590
if you look around whether the political system,
you cannot make system,

536
00:38:53.980 --> 00:38:57.400
societal system,
everything seems to be an upheaval.

537
00:38:58.060 --> 00:39:01.510
And we technologist have a responsibility,

538
00:39:02.320 --> 00:39:05.980
use what we know on a day to day basis to better this world.

539
00:39:06.370 --> 00:39:11.050
And one are the way to better the world is to make sure that we're not just

540
00:39:11.051 --> 00:39:12.730
doing technology for technology's sake,

541
00:39:12.910 --> 00:39:16.540
but always keep humans first as part of your thinking.

542
00:39:17.350 --> 00:39:21.580
So with that,
I don't know whether we still have about 10 minutes,

543
00:39:21.780 --> 00:39:24.280
we still can take one or two questions.

544
00:39:25.690 --> 00:39:27.140
<v 3>Yeah,
we can do the carry over your way.</v>

545
00:39:28.340 --> 00:39:32.990
How do you think about technologies that are,
I'm sure of by their very nature,

546
00:39:33.230 --> 00:39:36.020
less accessible?
So I'm thinking of things like ar and Vr,

547
00:39:36.021 --> 00:39:40.720
which is very visual or,
um,
like voice,
uh,

548
00:39:41.730 --> 00:39:42.620
voice assistance,

549
00:39:42.621 --> 00:39:46.190
which obviously wouldn't work very well for people with hearing impairment.
Uh,

550
00:39:46.220 --> 00:39:47.053
things like that.

551
00:39:47.480 --> 00:39:52.020
<v 0>I,
I personally think that,
um,
there will be,</v>

552
00:39:52.050 --> 00:39:52.883
um,

553
00:39:53.790 --> 00:39:57.120
there will be a convergence of a different technology coming together to

554
00:39:57.121 --> 00:40:01.730
multimodal kind of experience.
And,
um,
it's,

555
00:40:01.760 --> 00:40:03.920
it's not to say for a specific,

556
00:40:03.921 --> 00:40:08.190
a function that you,

557
00:40:08.490 --> 00:40:11.820
let's say it's a,
it's a,
VR is a completely visual,
right?

558
00:40:12.060 --> 00:40:16.200
But even that you can use,
for example,
um,

559
00:40:16.980 --> 00:40:21.090
uh,
machine learning or artificial intelligence to interpret the scene,

560
00:40:21.770 --> 00:40:25.830
um,
for the person who cannot see.
So one of the,
for example,

561
00:40:26.100 --> 00:40:27.510
one of the biggest,
um,

562
00:40:27.690 --> 00:40:32.690
piece of work this knee is working on is used to be that when you go see a

563
00:40:33.871 --> 00:40:38.370
movie,
um,
if you are blind,
you cannot,
obviously you cannot see,
right?

564
00:40:38.520 --> 00:40:41.580
So they have audio description of the scene.

565
00:40:42.150 --> 00:40:47.130
So if you'd done in novel for audio description of scenery,

566
00:40:47.820 --> 00:40:51.780
one can imagine that can be captured,
right?
You can,

567
00:40:51.810 --> 00:40:54.720
you can digitize that and that you begin to be,

568
00:40:54.721 --> 00:40:57.600
to develop a repository and that,

569
00:40:57.601 --> 00:41:01.970
so that even as you develop with the virtual reality kind of either games

570
00:41:01.980 --> 00:41:06.930
experience in or whatever,
you can still have voice,
you know,

571
00:41:07.460 --> 00:41:11.910
uh,
over.
So you can use the technologies,

572
00:41:11.940 --> 00:41:12.773
um,

573
00:41:12.930 --> 00:41:17.930
kind of efficiency and cost effective in the fad factor to begin to integrate,

574
00:41:19.060 --> 00:41:23.430
uh,
multiple,
um,
multiple technology together.

575
00:41:23.670 --> 00:41:27.270
So in the beginning it could be a single thread,

576
00:41:27.300 --> 00:41:31.530
but I think if you design and thinking that you want to be pervasively

577
00:41:31.531 --> 00:41:35.970
assessable,
then may start engaging other technology to,

578
00:41:35.990 --> 00:41:40.130
to compliment that.
Does that make sense?
Yup.

579
00:41:41.480 --> 00:41:42.500
Okay.
I landed,

580
00:41:42.830 --> 00:41:46.850
thank Francis for this very insightful and inspiring presentation.

581
00:41:47.260 --> 00:41:51.200
<v 1>[inaudible].</v>
