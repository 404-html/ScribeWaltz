00:00:06.030 --> 00:00:06.781
Here's Jose.

2
00:00:06.781 --> 00:00:11.781
He is the lead of the NASA International Space Station spheres and astro be

3
00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:12.960
program.

4
00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:17.250
The spears facility is one of the most used and popular ISS national labs with

5
00:00:17.251 --> 00:00:22.251
over 80 on board test sessions and 400 plus hours of on orbit activities.

6
00:00:23.020 --> 00:00:23.853
Today.

7
00:00:24.120 --> 00:00:28.440
Jose has a bachelor's and a master's in electrical engineering from Arizona

8
00:00:28.441 --> 00:00:30.960
State University.
Please help me welcome Jose

9
00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:35.410
<v 1>[inaudible].</v>

10
00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:37.430
<v 2>Thank you very much.</v>

11
00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:41.240
It's my privilege to be here and share with you some really exciting work I get

12
00:00:41.241 --> 00:00:44.690
to work on.
And Nasa Ames.
Uh,
as mentioned,

13
00:00:44.691 --> 00:00:49.691
I lead a small team at Nasa Ames that's a help support these fears and Acerbate

14
00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:53.250
facility,
uh,
to be more accurate.
We're,

15
00:00:53.251 --> 00:00:57.200
we're the team that keeps that platform operating on the space station and

16
00:00:57.201 --> 00:01:01.750
supporting research that occurs on,
on this platform,
uh,
for,
for,
uh,

17
00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:06.530
several years now in operation for over 10 years on the space station and then a

18
00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:11.030
what I'm here today and it's actually appropriate.
That's a five years after,
uh,

19
00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:14.990
mark ms series talk.
He led this effort,
um,

20
00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:19.370
before I did and uh,
I'm here to present what we've been doing since then.

21
00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:23.560
I also our recover some,
some of the work done in the past as well,

22
00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:25.290
including his work.
So you'll,

23
00:01:25.291 --> 00:01:29.150
you'll actually see his face and in this presentation as well.
Um,

24
00:01:29.550 --> 00:01:29.830
<v 1>yeah,</v>

25
00:01:29.830 --> 00:01:30.241
<v 2>so that's,</v>

26
00:01:30.241 --> 00:01:34.180
that's very appropriate and really excited to share this work with you today.

27
00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:41.650
So in this talk,
I will cover the ordnance story of how we got started.

28
00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:46.000
Uh,
first with some initial free flowers at NASA has worked on in the past,

29
00:01:46.001 --> 00:01:50.770
starting in the late nineties,
um,
even earlier than that.
And then spheres as the,

30
00:01:50.771 --> 00:01:53.440
uh,
uh,
platform that ended up,

31
00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:58.120
I ended up outlasting a lot of other free flowers,
top rate on the space station.

32
00:01:58.480 --> 00:02:01.750
Um,
some of the really cool work we've done with that over the 10 years.

33
00:02:01.751 --> 00:02:05.740
It's been in operation on space station.
Um,
certainly the free flower that,
uh,

34
00:02:05.741 --> 00:02:09.070
that could and um,
and then get into,
well,

35
00:02:09.071 --> 00:02:13.170
why are we looking at free flying space robots?
Uh,
no question about it.
That,

36
00:02:13.171 --> 00:02:14.670
that sounds cool,
right?
But,
uh,

37
00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:19.600
there's a lot of really good reasons for doing that.
Um,
and then,

38
00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:22.150
uh,
going into the next generation of free flying space,

39
00:02:22.151 --> 00:02:24.780
robots that were or were not working out at Nasa Ames,
uh,

40
00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:27.440
to be delivered to space station early next year.
Um,

41
00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:32.230
so some really exciting capabilities coming online and there our guest scientist

42
00:02:32.231 --> 00:02:36.910
program where we have some processes set up to enable guests,

43
00:02:36.911 --> 00:02:40.700
researchers from academia,
private industry,
uh,

44
00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:43.720
commercial industry,
uh,
academic,
uh,
universities,

45
00:02:44.020 --> 00:02:46.570
companies all over the world,
not just us,

46
00:02:46.571 --> 00:02:49.810
but all over the world to use this platform on the space station to do some

47
00:02:49.811 --> 00:02:54.090
really cool research and to enable a future,
uh,
autonomy on,
uh,

48
00:02:54.370 --> 00:02:55.203
in space.

49
00:02:57.230 --> 00:03:00.730
And then I'm just going to touch on some future free flour and research that

50
00:03:00.731 --> 00:03:01.500
we're looking at,

51
00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:04.510
how we're already working with people who have ideas for how to use asked to be

52
00:03:04.511 --> 00:03:08.710
on the space station,
uh,
and then touch on stem outreach.
So Science,
technology,

53
00:03:08.711 --> 00:03:10.030
engineering and mathematics.

54
00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:13.000
And that's a big part of what we do with these free flyers.
Um,

55
00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:15.310
and some exciting work that we've been doing with spheres.

56
00:03:15.311 --> 00:03:20.290
And now continuing with the Astros,
free flowers for spheres got started.

57
00:03:20.291 --> 00:03:23.950
And like I said in the late nineties,
originally with this first project called,

58
00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:27.910
uh,
the,
um,
Psa,
uh,

59
00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:32.440
an adjustable autonomy spacecraft free flying robot.
So as you can tell,

60
00:03:32.441 --> 00:03:35.800
it looks very sleek,
very capable,
and it was a great project.

61
00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:39.340
They did a lot of work in the field.
Um,

62
00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:44.830
and let me jump straight to a video here.
Uh,
this is one of the early prototypes,

63
00:03:44.890 --> 00:03:47.470
uh,
on display at ames.
Um,

64
00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:52.660
certainly looks a lot like a certain a droid from,
from uh,
Star Wars.

65
00:03:53.110 --> 00:03:57.160
Uh,
certainly we get a lot of inspiration from science fiction as a,

66
00:03:57.161 --> 00:03:59.410
as I'll get to as well.
Um,
here's a,

67
00:03:59.411 --> 00:04:04.411
a rendering of the real thing in a mock up of what the PSI PSA looked like.

68
00:04:05.350 --> 00:04:09.970
Um,
personal satellite assistant as what PSA stood for.
Um,

69
00:04:10.240 --> 00:04:13.210
and some really cool video that I was able to dig up about.

70
00:04:13.211 --> 00:04:16.270
It's operation in our micro gravity test facility.

71
00:04:16.271 --> 00:04:19.660
This is a lab we have at Ames that a,

72
00:04:19.661 --> 00:04:23.680
it's basically the world's greatest crane game.
I tell Ya,
cause I've,

73
00:04:23.681 --> 00:04:25.510
I've worked with this and uh,

74
00:04:25.511 --> 00:04:30.511
it's this gantry and a room set up to simulate what you might see on the space

75
00:04:30.821 --> 00:04:31.510
station.

76
00:04:31.510 --> 00:04:35.260
And this gantry allows us free flour to move in a full six degree of freedom

77
00:04:35.261 --> 00:04:40.060
motion across the module,
uh,
in much the way it would,
uh,
in space.

78
00:04:40.180 --> 00:04:42.850
So the gantries canceling out the gravity,
um,

79
00:04:42.940 --> 00:04:46.250
and allowing this to move under its own proportion,
um,

80
00:04:46.360 --> 00:04:49.480
and navigate across this mockup of the space station.

81
00:04:50.620 --> 00:04:53.020
You can tell this,
uh,
back in the late nineties,

82
00:04:53.021 --> 00:04:56.260
there were looking at vision based navigation that a fiduciary on the screen

83
00:04:56.261 --> 00:04:59.860
there.
Um,
and then this,
uh,
uh,

84
00:04:59.890 --> 00:05:04.270
rendering of what the PSA model looked like.

85
00:05:04.630 --> 00:05:07.900
I thought this was some really cool video to share.
Uh,

86
00:05:08.350 --> 00:05:13.180
late nineties through 2003,
I want to say this,
this project was going,

87
00:05:13.660 --> 00:05:16.480
um,
but ultimately did not end up on space station.

88
00:05:16.481 --> 00:05:20.350
This project got canceled early.
Um,
but,
uh,

89
00:05:20.351 --> 00:05:21.790
they certainly made a lot of advances.

90
00:05:21.880 --> 00:05:25.420
So certainly looking at becoming an assistant to crew right.

91
00:05:25.540 --> 00:05:29.010
Back then there were working with the PDAs.
Right.
And,
uh,

92
00:05:29.050 --> 00:05:32.830
how do you provide the functionality of a PDA to an astronaut on the space

93
00:05:32.831 --> 00:05:36.880
station?
So they were looking at vision based navigation,
um,
scheduling,

94
00:05:37.190 --> 00:05:39.910
uh,
identifying,
uh,

95
00:05:39.970 --> 00:05:42.850
faults and anomalies on space station and notifying crew.

96
00:05:42.940 --> 00:05:46.480
So all kinds of really cool functionality that you'd want out of a free flying

97
00:05:46.481 --> 00:05:48.190
space robot on the space station.

98
00:05:49.480 --> 00:05:52.090
But unfortunately that did not get a continued.
Uh,

99
00:05:52.091 --> 00:05:55.840
here's another free flying project that operate in the late nineties.
Uh,

100
00:05:55.930 --> 00:06:00.930
the video here you're seeing is of air cam let out of a group at JSC that did an

101
00:06:02.121 --> 00:06:07.121
actual eva free flying a experiment outside the space shuttle in 1997.

102
00:06:08.420 --> 00:06:12.650
Um,
and so they were successful in getting a lot of flight time with that or at

103
00:06:12.651 --> 00:06:14.750
least a limited amount of flight time,
um,

104
00:06:15.320 --> 00:06:19.580
and as opposed to PSA or spheres are now asked to be,
uh,

105
00:06:19.610 --> 00:06:22.590
Eric Cam was designed to operate outside,
uh,

106
00:06:22.640 --> 00:06:27.640
as it on its own and an EBA ex external vehicle activity versus Iba internal

107
00:06:28.161 --> 00:06:31.670
vehicle activity.
So again,
a lot of advances there,

108
00:06:31.671 --> 00:06:33.620
but ultimately that did not continue

109
00:06:36.500 --> 00:06:39.290
really cool picture of PSA.
Uh,
or,
I'm sorry,

110
00:06:39.350 --> 00:06:42.890
Eric Cam operating outside the space shuttle together with crew.

111
00:06:42.891 --> 00:06:46.230
There were two people operating outside of the spacial there.

112
00:06:46.510 --> 00:06:51.020
Another video of,
uh,
Eric Cam doing some,

113
00:06:51.021 --> 00:06:53.910
a navigation there.
It was fully,
uh,
um,

114
00:06:54.710 --> 00:06:57.500
remote controlled from a crew member inside the space station.
Look,

115
00:06:57.501 --> 00:07:00.440
hanging out the window.
You'll,
you can tell from some of this video,

116
00:07:00.441 --> 00:07:03.660
there was some colored markers outside Air Cam,

117
00:07:03.661 --> 00:07:07.850
and that was actually how the astronauts,
uh,
identified its motion as it rotated,

118
00:07:07.851 --> 00:07:08.541
right?
They,

119
00:07:08.541 --> 00:07:12.440
they're handing a joystick and trying to control from inside the space shuttle.

120
00:07:12.590 --> 00:07:14.070
Uh,
it's,
uh,
uh,

121
00:07:14.330 --> 00:07:18.090
pan tilt rotation and so forth using those indicators,
uh,

122
00:07:18.200 --> 00:07:19.790
painted onto air cam.

123
00:07:20.450 --> 00:07:21.150
<v 1>Okay.</v>

124
00:07:21.150 --> 00:07:25.830
<v 2>And so along come along comes a spheres,
which was a,</v>

125
00:07:25.890 --> 00:07:27.270
a student build project,

126
00:07:27.330 --> 00:07:32.330
ultimately a very smart team of students and researchers at MIT funded by Darpa

127
00:07:33.840 --> 00:07:36.860
to look at,
uh,
in space,
um,

128
00:07:37.680 --> 00:07:41.950
satellite work and building a facility where you can do,
uh,

129
00:07:42.060 --> 00:07:46.710
some risk tolerant research,
uh,
in space.
And,
uh,

130
00:07:46.800 --> 00:07:49.500
it's this scrappy little project that could,

131
00:07:49.501 --> 00:07:53.100
and ultimately I went on top rate for over 10 years on the space station.

132
00:07:53.590 --> 00:07:54.423
<v 1>MMM.</v>

133
00:07:57.570 --> 00:08:00.500
<v 2>Uh,
it started in 2006,
first operated,
um,</v>

134
00:08:00.560 --> 00:08:04.370
and then transitioned to Nasa Ames in 2010 to be operated as,
as facility.

135
00:08:04.580 --> 00:08:08.430
So first operated by MIT,
um,
under Darpa funding.
Um,

136
00:08:08.450 --> 00:08:12.800
it was decided that a NASA operated as a full full fledge facility on space

137
00:08:12.801 --> 00:08:13.910
station offering.

138
00:08:13.911 --> 00:08:17.480
It's used to researchers all over the country and all over the world.
Um,

139
00:08:17.630 --> 00:08:18.141
and again,

140
00:08:18.141 --> 00:08:21.680
one of the big benefits of this kind of facility inside the space station is

141
00:08:21.681 --> 00:08:25.520
it's very risk tolerant.
You can do advanced,
uh,

142
00:08:25.550 --> 00:08:27.800
research and,
uh,
testing,

143
00:08:27.801 --> 00:08:32.390
rapid iteration type work in a environment where you can afford to fail.

144
00:08:32.540 --> 00:08:36.020
You can afford a different bugs.
For example,
put up a new algorithm,

145
00:08:36.200 --> 00:08:40.460
run into a bug,
and,
uh,
we can just call up to the astronauts,
say,
Hey,

146
00:08:40.670 --> 00:08:42.200
push the reset button and try again.

147
00:08:42.590 --> 00:08:45.410
That's not something you can do with a dedicated space system or satellite

148
00:08:45.411 --> 00:08:47.120
operating a all by itself.

149
00:08:47.330 --> 00:08:50.360
So it provides us a very comfortable of lab to operate in.

150
00:08:50.540 --> 00:08:55.150
You can think of ISS as an orbiting lab,
except it's in space,
right?
Uh,

151
00:08:55.151 --> 00:08:59.580
were you can do experiments,
iteration,
uh,
and very fast development.

152
00:09:00.330 --> 00:09:00.980
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

153
00:09:00.980 --> 00:09:04.640
<v 2>And I would argue that's one of the big reasons for its success over the last 10</v>

154
00:09:04.641 --> 00:09:07.720
years where one of them was operated facilities on space station.
Uh,

155
00:09:07.750 --> 00:09:10.280
as mentioned earlier,
over 80 a hundred,

156
00:09:10.400 --> 00:09:14.110
we're closing in on a hundred test sessions,
operate on the space station,

157
00:09:14.120 --> 00:09:17.660
over 600 hours of crew time spent on,

158
00:09:17.690 --> 00:09:20.870
on space station operating all kinds of research and I'm going to cover some of

159
00:09:20.871 --> 00:09:23.900
that research done over the 10 years.
Um,

160
00:09:24.470 --> 00:09:27.680
and I would argue one reason for that is,
uh,

161
00:09:28.220 --> 00:09:32.030
our rapid iteration pushing the boundaries of what NASA can do on the space

162
00:09:32.031 --> 00:09:35.480
station.
As you can imagine,
uh,
NASA has,

163
00:09:35.570 --> 00:09:39.850
has in the past had this mindset of failure is not an option,
right?
We've,

164
00:09:39.851 --> 00:09:44.810
we've learned some hard lessons in that regard and certainly with regards to

165
00:09:44.811 --> 00:09:48.290
crew safety,
that's very important.
But a,
together with the ISS program,

166
00:09:48.440 --> 00:09:52.790
we've transitioned into this idea where we can do very rapid iteration and high

167
00:09:52.791 --> 00:09:55.100
risk type of research on,
on space station,

168
00:09:56.420 --> 00:09:58.760
at least in regards to a machine success.

169
00:10:00.110 --> 00:10:02.420
Here's that small team out of MIT doing some,

170
00:10:02.421 --> 00:10:06.820
a vomit comet testing with MIT.
And,
uh,

171
00:10:08.090 --> 00:10:10.400
here's a picture of his fears,
uh,
on the ground.

172
00:10:10.401 --> 00:10:12.960
This is a affectionately referred to as blue.
Uh,

173
00:10:13.100 --> 00:10:16.670
there are three in operation on the space station three and are at least three

174
00:10:16.671 --> 00:10:21.170
and operation on the ground that can simulate exactly what we do up on space

175
00:10:21.171 --> 00:10:22.004
station.

176
00:10:22.140 --> 00:10:22.973
<v 1>Okay.</v>

177
00:10:23.010 --> 00:10:27.920
<v 2>Uh,
spheres is operated by a CEO to compress the o two tanks,</v>

178
00:10:28.130 --> 00:10:31.910
a lot like the paintball guns.
If you ever gotten paintballing put in a tank,

179
00:10:32.210 --> 00:10:35.240
a little swollen lines open up and there are 12 different thrusters that give

180
00:10:35.241 --> 00:10:39.800
you four holonomics motion,
uh,
across the space station.
A very much like the,

181
00:10:39.801 --> 00:10:41.470
that droid on space station,
uh,

182
00:10:41.630 --> 00:10:45.880
or join in star wars I should refer to as the origin story for spheres goes.
Uh,

183
00:10:45.890 --> 00:10:50.120
there was that MIT professor that a challenge is senior design team,
uh,

184
00:10:50.150 --> 00:10:53.990
by showing them that very clip out of star wars from uh,
uh,

185
00:10:54.020 --> 00:10:58.070
where you see that the trainer droid,
right shooting lasers at Luke Skywalker.

186
00:10:58.250 --> 00:11:00.320
And he challenged them to build that exact thing.
And,

187
00:11:00.590 --> 00:11:02.630
and that's what they went on and did.

188
00:11:03.440 --> 00:11:04.100
<v 1>Yeah,</v>

189
00:11:04.100 --> 00:11:08.360
<v 2>some cool pictures of what's inside a very jam packed a about the size of a</v>

190
00:11:08.361 --> 00:11:09.770
volleyball,
uh,

191
00:11:09.771 --> 00:11:13.520
spheres is for the avionics and it's a fully enclosed satellite system.

192
00:11:13.521 --> 00:11:17.600
And that's what they initially set out to build with a satellite like spacecraft

193
00:11:17.630 --> 00:11:21.830
where they can test out a satellite algorithms,
formation flight,
um,

194
00:11:21.980 --> 00:11:26.150
in space,
uh,
construction,
automated docking,
all kinds of really cool research.

195
00:11:26.420 --> 00:11:29.450
And here's some videos showing their operation on the space station.

196
00:11:29.451 --> 00:11:33.050
This is from one of the earlier,
uh,
test sessions.
Uh,

197
00:11:33.051 --> 00:11:36.680
and this video is better for time,
so they don't actually move around this fast.

198
00:11:37.020 --> 00:11:37.250
Uh,

199
00:11:37.250 --> 00:11:42.170
but it gives you an idea for how they move around up in space station and just

200
00:11:42.171 --> 00:11:44.000
the type of maneuvers they capable of doing.

201
00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:52.800
Uh,
it's,
it's no wonder that,
uh,

202
00:11:52.830 --> 00:11:56.490
this one of the favorite payloads for the restaurants and be working on,
uh,
they,

203
00:11:56.530 --> 00:12:00.790
they certainly do have dark hair maintenance and,
and,
uh,
uh,
other science.

204
00:12:00.791 --> 00:12:04.690
But these things are all out toys that they get to pull out.
And in fact,
uh,

205
00:12:04.691 --> 00:12:09.691
in one a occurrence and astronauts requested to use these spheres on his weekend

206
00:12:10.750 --> 00:12:11.471
time.
I asked me,

207
00:12:11.471 --> 00:12:15.250
I still get a free time on the weekends and he was so enthralled with using

208
00:12:15.251 --> 00:12:18.490
these spheres,
uh,
um,
uh,

209
00:12:18.550 --> 00:12:21.880
free flyers that you wanted to pull them out on a weekend and look at some

210
00:12:22.150 --> 00:12:26.480
interesting research on how these things can be useful for crew,
uh,
uh,

211
00:12:26.680 --> 00:12:30.760
on a day to day basis.
And with the Mike Hopkins,
I believe it was,
uh,

212
00:12:30.761 --> 00:12:34.480
on the space station.
And so a certainly a favorite payload on,
on space station.

213
00:12:34.990 --> 00:12:39.950
And,
uh,
as I said in over 10 years,
we've done a lot of really cool research,
um,

214
00:12:41.080 --> 00:12:45.740
on space station in both foundational fundamental research and uh,

215
00:12:46.260 --> 00:12:49.750
uh,
the move moving up slash,
and let me just jump into some of these right away,

216
00:12:49.870 --> 00:12:53.650
but this like kind of gives you an outline of where a PSA,

217
00:12:53.970 --> 00:12:57.590
I'm Eric Cam a sphere is over 10 years and now I asked her B,

218
00:12:57.591 --> 00:13:02.591
it's going to take over next year in 2018 and how they can feed into allow the

219
00:13:02.681 --> 00:13:07.660
technology areas that NASA is identified as being important for advancing space

220
00:13:07.661 --> 00:13:09.220
technology and exploration.

221
00:13:12.960 --> 00:13:14.910
We made this special from national geographic

222
00:13:15.650 --> 00:13:20.360
<v 3>what you're working on in this lab.
Yeah.</v>

223
00:13:20.400 --> 00:13:25.400
This is an experiment called fears and do you see a satellite Robert that's

224
00:13:25.411 --> 00:13:28.330
specifically designed to function in the micro gravity?

225
00:13:28.620 --> 00:13:32.930
They contained the software that the scientists are testing and eventually these

226
00:13:32.931 --> 00:13:36.890
will be used to create robots that can go outside of the space station and

227
00:13:36.891 --> 00:13:40.670
perform it used affection,
a repair and other tasks.
You space,

228
00:13:42.410 --> 00:13:46.140
<v 2>yeah.
Only payload during that entire hour,
uh,</v>

229
00:13:46.230 --> 00:13:48.240
to be operated live,
uh,

230
00:13:48.330 --> 00:13:52.920
for that special as a full hour long special national geographic did where they

231
00:13:52.921 --> 00:13:55.620
were interviewing crew and going through the day in the life of crew.

232
00:13:55.830 --> 00:13:59.580
And certainly,
uh,
doing a lot of education on what we do on the space station.

233
00:13:59.581 --> 00:14:02.430
The vast amount of research that gets done on the space station.

234
00:14:02.700 --> 00:14:05.600
And we were fortunate enough to be a operated,
uh,

235
00:14:05.670 --> 00:14:10.350
live during that a tape and not taping but,
uh,
streamed live to the public.

236
00:14:10.740 --> 00:14:12.510
Um,
and,
and,

237
00:14:12.990 --> 00:14:16.740
and we were actually left operating for a good several minutes after that as he

238
00:14:16.741 --> 00:14:18.240
went on talking about other,
other,

239
00:14:18.250 --> 00:14:21.060
the research and we've kept the operating in the background and it made for some

240
00:14:21.061 --> 00:14:23.940
not great backdrop to that.
Special

241
00:14:26.520 --> 00:14:31.170
rings was,
uh,
an interesting investigation,
uh,
where they looked at,
uh,

242
00:14:31.230 --> 00:14:35.610
electromagnetic,
um,
formation flight where they're trying to figure out,

243
00:14:35.611 --> 00:14:38.550
can you navigate free flowers using just electricity,

244
00:14:38.880 --> 00:14:42.060
electromagnetic formation flight where you're trying to control the distance

245
00:14:42.061 --> 00:14:46.980
between two objects using big rings,
generating a electromagnetic field.

246
00:14:47.310 --> 00:14:52.200
And certainly one of the concepts they're looking at for a wide aperture,
um,

247
00:14:53.030 --> 00:14:56.750
type telescopes where you want to keep a lot of different things,
uh,

248
00:14:56.751 --> 00:15:01.730
in synchronous operation,
in,
in orbit,
uh,
without using fuel.
And so this is,

249
00:15:01.820 --> 00:15:06.110
uh,
uh,
one way to,
one approach to that.
And in addition,

250
00:15:06.111 --> 00:15:09.050
they were looking at wireless power transfer,
um,

251
00:15:09.950 --> 00:15:14.090
and trying to transfer power from one item to the other.

252
00:15:14.570 --> 00:15:19.380
And this is another example of where we set out to do one thing.
Um,

253
00:15:19.670 --> 00:15:23.180
and then we kind of adapt to what we end up with.

254
00:15:23.450 --> 00:15:26.170
As you can tell if you look closely at this video,
uh,

255
00:15:26.360 --> 00:15:30.080
the ring unit on the left is tied down by Bungee cords.

256
00:15:30.320 --> 00:15:34.550
The original concept was do some initial characterization and they should be

257
00:15:34.551 --> 00:15:38.690
able to navigate with respect to each other using just the rings.
Um,

258
00:15:39.020 --> 00:15:43.820
but they ran into some issues with the algorithm and we pulled what we resources

259
00:15:43.821 --> 00:15:48.410
we had on the space station,
uh,
tied one down on the left and uh,
restricted that,

260
00:15:48.460 --> 00:15:49.510
uh,
freedom,
uh,

261
00:15:49.600 --> 00:15:53.510
of the left unit and allowed the other unit to control itself with respect to

262
00:15:53.511 --> 00:15:56.320
the other one.
Um,
so,
uh,

263
00:15:56.330 --> 00:16:00.050
just another way where we've had to come up with some creative solutions to get

264
00:16:00.051 --> 00:16:04.510
research done on,
on space station.
Uh,
even repairing the fears unit.
Um,

265
00:16:04.850 --> 00:16:08.930
when they break over 10 years,
they do break.
Um,
and we've had to bring them down,

266
00:16:08.931 --> 00:16:13.280
repair it,
and very quickly put it back in operation on the space station.
Um,

267
00:16:15.380 --> 00:16:16.760
Vertigo was,
uh,

268
00:16:16.761 --> 00:16:21.290
an investigation where MIT is looking at vision based navigation using

269
00:16:21.291 --> 00:16:26.150
stereoscopic vision.
Much like the eyes are eyes,
consensus,
distance,
uh,

270
00:16:26.151 --> 00:16:29.210
with the things around us because we have two eyes that have a fixed distance

271
00:16:29.211 --> 00:16:30.044
from each other.

272
00:16:30.200 --> 00:16:33.390
And a stereoscopic vision is trying to do the same thing here where it's like

273
00:16:33.391 --> 00:16:38.260
trying to identify,
um,
a,
an unknown target,
right?
You're approaching a us,

274
00:16:38.330 --> 00:16:41.260
uh,
an asteroid or a,
um,

275
00:16:41.640 --> 00:16:46.220
a dead satellite and you want to identify not only where it is and where I am,

276
00:16:46.340 --> 00:16:48.080
but also its mass and it's inertia.

277
00:16:48.080 --> 00:16:53.080
So you know how to circumnavigate around it or approach it to Deorbit Deorbit

278
00:16:53.941 --> 00:16:56.360
it,
um,
or anything you want in mind want to do.

279
00:16:56.361 --> 00:16:59.920
So this is an investigation looking at that,
uh,

280
00:16:59.950 --> 00:17:04.290
where they were able to attach those goggles on to spheres and navigate around,

281
00:17:04.330 --> 00:17:07.910
uh,
another spheres unit.
Um,
uh,
again,

282
00:17:07.911 --> 00:17:11.120
one of the big reasons for sphere success is its extensibility,
right?

283
00:17:11.121 --> 00:17:14.720
It's got an expansion port,
we add new hardware.
It's very modular,

284
00:17:14.840 --> 00:17:18.470
allows us to expand those capabilities over time.
Halo,

285
00:17:18.471 --> 00:17:22.460
another MIT lead a effort where they're adding additional expansion ports on his

286
00:17:22.480 --> 00:17:23.690
fears.
One wasn't enough.

287
00:17:23.870 --> 00:17:27.660
They're not looking at in space servicing in space construction,
uh,

288
00:17:27.670 --> 00:17:31.160
automated docking where you've got not just two,
three,

289
00:17:31.310 --> 00:17:34.760
but even more units trying to,
uh,
operate together.

290
00:17:34.910 --> 00:17:36.410
And how do you dock them with each other?

291
00:17:36.411 --> 00:17:39.310
How do you navigate with respect to each other?
So they're,

292
00:17:39.311 --> 00:17:42.190
they're adding more expansion ports on there to support things.
Like a,

293
00:17:42.240 --> 00:17:45.860
these rigid docking ports,
right?
How do you dock with each other,
um,

294
00:17:46.640 --> 00:17:49.830
and rigidly attached to each other in multiple locations,
uh,

295
00:17:49.950 --> 00:17:52.440
to form a bigger space craft in space,
right?

296
00:17:52.441 --> 00:17:54.120
That's a lot of what we're going to need to do.

297
00:17:54.330 --> 00:17:58.500
If we go to Mars or other deep space,
does he uh,
um,
designations,

298
00:17:58.830 --> 00:18:03.830
destinations a is try to do assembly in space and that's a lot of the technology

299
00:18:04.021 --> 00:18:06.480
they're looking at advancing with,
uh,
with spheres here

300
00:18:08.930 --> 00:18:13.550
slash this is a particular favorite of mine where they're looking at the

301
00:18:13.790 --> 00:18:18.790
performance of fluid in space and more specifically fuel in an upper stage

302
00:18:18.981 --> 00:18:20.810
rocket,
right?
We have software,

303
00:18:20.811 --> 00:18:24.320
we have CFD algorithms that can predict the kind of forces and upper stage

304
00:18:24.321 --> 00:18:27.110
rocket might see in micro gravity.
But believe it or not,

305
00:18:27.111 --> 00:18:30.980
those have never been validated,
right?
Even I with aeronautics in wind tunnels,

306
00:18:31.190 --> 00:18:34.510
you test out that kind of stuff that validates your codes.
Uh,

307
00:18:34.550 --> 00:18:37.370
but with the fuel in opera stage rockets in microgravity,

308
00:18:37.430 --> 00:18:39.650
that's a very difficult thing to do anywhere on earth,
right?

309
00:18:39.890 --> 00:18:42.440
We've got this pesky gravity vector gone on around here.

310
00:18:42.441 --> 00:18:44.890
So inside the space station,
it's a,

311
00:18:44.891 --> 00:18:49.490
a great environment for testing out this type of thing where basically a pill

312
00:18:49.700 --> 00:18:54.330
shaped tank of dye colored,
uh,
water,
uh,

313
00:18:54.560 --> 00:18:59.030
can be slashed around an HD cameras on both sides can take video of it's

314
00:18:59.031 --> 00:19:03.440
movement and respond to controlled movement from this fears,
right?

315
00:19:03.440 --> 00:19:07.640
You have two spheres originally attached to this pill on two sides.
Um,

316
00:19:08.450 --> 00:19:11.480
and it'll move it [inaudible] known ways.
There's an IMU on,

317
00:19:11.481 --> 00:19:13.490
they're measuring the exact forces being applied.

318
00:19:13.640 --> 00:19:17.030
And then with AC cameras you're taking video of the fluid movement and is it

319
00:19:17.031 --> 00:19:21.570
moving as you expect,
as your software predicts it to operate in.
And um,

320
00:19:21.860 --> 00:19:25.130
as I get to later,
a lot of the results from this,
um,

321
00:19:25.160 --> 00:19:28.880
went directly and supported the efforts by all the major launch providers.

322
00:19:29.090 --> 00:19:33.350
They were very interested in the results of this.
And,
uh,
the crew certainly got,

323
00:19:33.440 --> 00:19:37.530
uh,
um,
had a lot of fun with this.
Uh,
you,

324
00:19:37.560 --> 00:19:41.510
you may have seen other videos where crews doing experiments using water,
coffee,

325
00:19:41.660 --> 00:19:44.060
all these different really cool things you can do in microgravity while with

326
00:19:44.061 --> 00:19:46.490
these things.
You have a,
a nice,
uh,

327
00:19:47.300 --> 00:19:51.470
a controlled experiment where you can see how fluid moves inside of a tank and

328
00:19:51.471 --> 00:19:53.750
you end up getting some really cool behavior.
Here.

329
00:19:53.751 --> 00:19:58.751
You're seeing little bubbles form that orbit each other and thyre round inside

330
00:19:59.691 --> 00:20:03.410
the tank,
but they're resistant to becoming part of the bigger blob.
Right.

331
00:20:03.620 --> 00:20:04.880
And in microgravity,

332
00:20:04.910 --> 00:20:08.690
the surface tension of water is a lot greater and counts for a lot more of,

333
00:20:08.691 --> 00:20:12.320
it's a motion,
which is why it's,
it's so different than how it operates.

334
00:20:12.350 --> 00:20:13.250
I here on the ground.

335
00:20:17.130 --> 00:20:17.963
<v 1>Okay.</v>

336
00:20:18.450 --> 00:20:20.880
<v 2>I think there's a little more to this where he brings this a little closer to</v>

337
00:20:20.881 --> 00:20:25.210
the camera and
yeah,
I spent a long time looking at these.

338
00:20:25.230 --> 00:20:29.270
Are there a that's so much fun and especially as a crew,

339
00:20:29.280 --> 00:20:33.500
you can tell they're this other crew member in particular was just laughing the

340
00:20:33.501 --> 00:20:36.740
whole time cause he,
uh,
he had fun with these.
Uh,
and again,
this,

341
00:20:36.741 --> 00:20:40.830
this was not originally intended,
uh,
the platform you saw earlier with what,
uh,

342
00:20:40.910 --> 00:20:44.570
this big plastic thing that was holding the cameras between the two spheres of

343
00:20:44.571 --> 00:20:47.590
units.
And as he discovered the crew member moving around,

344
00:20:47.800 --> 00:20:49.300
you'll do a lot better science.

345
00:20:49.480 --> 00:20:52.960
And then here was yet another audition where they're duct taping these things

346
00:20:52.961 --> 00:20:56.260
together and seeing what they can do with these tanks all by themselves.

347
00:20:57.730 --> 00:21:01.390
So just getting more bang for the buck using a hardware for a recent up there.

348
00:21:01.600 --> 00:21:06.600
And yet another investigation is now being conducted later this year where

349
00:21:07.151 --> 00:21:09.970
they've attached,
um,
this,

350
00:21:09.971 --> 00:21:13.390
these pills to spheres using tethers.

351
00:21:13.570 --> 00:21:17.650
There was another investigation tethering to,
uh,
spheres together.
Um,

352
00:21:17.651 --> 00:21:19.870
and looking at the tethered dynamics,
right?

353
00:21:19.960 --> 00:21:22.330
How do you deorbit space junk in space.

354
00:21:22.780 --> 00:21:25.480
There's companies looking at exactly how to do that.
So they're looking at,

355
00:21:25.630 --> 00:21:28.270
you tell the two objects were kind of dynamics,
can you expect,

356
00:21:28.390 --> 00:21:31.930
can you talk one down out of outer space?
And,
um,

357
00:21:32.260 --> 00:21:35.080
after that investigation was conducted really good stuff from that.

358
00:21:35.320 --> 00:21:38.950
And then at the end of that,
uh,
we get together every quarter and,

359
00:21:38.951 --> 00:21:43.600
and users as fears and astro.
And we came up with this idea of putting a,

360
00:21:43.601 --> 00:21:46.690
the tether investigation together with fears is hardware already on station.

361
00:21:47.140 --> 00:21:48.340
All the hard work's already done.

362
00:21:48.370 --> 00:21:52.480
It turns out they work really well together together with um,
uh,
Airbus,
uh,

363
00:21:52.481 --> 00:21:56.740
actually led that investigation.
And,
um,
and again,

364
00:21:56.741 --> 00:22:01.310
when we hope to get some more interesting video later this year of tethered,
uh,

365
00:22:01.330 --> 00:22:05.920
slash tanks moving around space station.
So,
uh,
some other really cool research.

366
00:22:06.070 --> 00:22:10.140
Now we're getting into a little bit of what a,
a previous talk given here,
uh,

367
00:22:10.240 --> 00:22:12.940
talked about with smart spheres,
um,

368
00:22:13.600 --> 00:22:18.180
where they at basically attached an android powered smartphone,
uh,

369
00:22:18.190 --> 00:22:22.990
on s fears to look at more robotic type applications of,

370
00:22:23.300 --> 00:22:26.680
uh,
spheres,
right.
Spheres of it was initially designed to be more of a satellite,

371
00:22:26.980 --> 00:22:29.300
but with us with a smartphone,

372
00:22:29.440 --> 00:22:32.170
with all the capabilities that it has a camera processing,

373
00:22:32.560 --> 00:22:35.770
a order of magnitude better than what was in spheres,
right?
10 years ago,

374
00:22:35.890 --> 00:22:39.210
the state of the art was this tea I DSP that the ends up running the its

375
00:22:39.220 --> 00:22:41.470
operating system with this a smartphone.

376
00:22:41.500 --> 00:22:45.010
They were able to do a lot more with that and stream and tele operated from the

377
00:22:45.011 --> 00:22:46.030
ground.
Um,

378
00:22:46.031 --> 00:22:48.760
and in fact I think I'm going to get to some video here that describes,
yeah,

379
00:22:48.770 --> 00:22:53.270
<v 1>Sadie mortgage
reinsurance up and burning</v>

380
00:22:54.910 --> 00:22:59.110
one zero lift off the final lift off of it.

381
00:23:00.140 --> 00:23:04.740
Shoulders of the space shuttle America will continue to drink.

382
00:23:08.040 --> 00:23:12.870
<v 4>We're working towards is a future in which we can have robots that will take</v>

383
00:23:12.871 --> 00:23:15.510
over a lot of the menial tasks that asked her not to do.

384
00:23:17.580 --> 00:23:22.320
Our first goal for our project is to have ground controllers driving the sphere

385
00:23:22.321 --> 00:23:25.170
around on the space station.
The sphere,

386
00:23:25.290 --> 00:23:30.290
we'll take data and pictures and sensor readings and send that back to the user.

387
00:23:30.700 --> 00:23:33.700
<v 5>She hooks it to the front and at that point the phone will be able to tell the</v>

388
00:23:33.701 --> 00:23:37.120
sphere of where it needs to go.
The processor,

389
00:23:37.121 --> 00:23:41.500
the camera and all of the sensors that are in the next assess become the brains

390
00:23:41.501 --> 00:23:45.320
of the robot and told the sphere where it wants to fly.

391
00:23:46.670 --> 00:23:51.670
<v 1>The wifi on the phone connects to the station Wifi that gets linked down to the</v>

392
00:23:52.221 --> 00:23:55.190
ground and then hopefully we're going to be able to control it from the ground

393
00:23:55.650 --> 00:24:00.130
<v 4>because the nexus ass,
because the phone is very easy to take apart.</v>

394
00:24:00.310 --> 00:24:01.630
Android is easy to program.

395
00:24:01.660 --> 00:24:06.220
We're familiar with it and we needed to make a lot of customizations that are

396
00:24:06.610 --> 00:24:08.080
easier to make.
With android.

397
00:24:08.800 --> 00:24:12.670
<v 1>Google was also working on an open source data logger and it met our use case</v>

398
00:24:12.671 --> 00:24:13.504
requirements.

399
00:24:13.570 --> 00:24:17.500
You can download this application for your android device and US exact same

400
00:24:17.501 --> 00:24:21.250
application.
That's what NASA is using.
The more time that the astronauts

401
00:24:21.490 --> 00:24:24.880
<v 4>Ben doing science,
the more value we're getting out of that</v>

402
00:24:25.040 --> 00:24:25.710
<v 1>best men.</v>

403
00:24:25.710 --> 00:24:30.360
Our goal is to provide enough value to crew and enough value top operations that

404
00:24:30.361 --> 00:24:32.160
they'll be able to keep it up there for a long time.

405
00:24:35.180 --> 00:24:38.100
Roger ran with Atlanta,
Houston now

406
00:24:42.970 --> 00:24:47.200
<v 2>android in space.
Got To love it.
I'm so smart.</v>

407
00:24:47.201 --> 00:24:51.840
Spheres to went on to do a better smart phones and in fact utilized a,
uh,

408
00:24:51.970 --> 00:24:55.540
advanced project tango smartphone that got attached onto his fears,

409
00:24:55.750 --> 00:25:00.380
which did even better as sensing and three d imaging of its environment.
Um,

410
00:25:00.760 --> 00:25:04.180
and that was a really cool investigation where for the first time spheres was

411
00:25:04.181 --> 00:25:07.930
operated outside its comfort zone.
Spheres navigate a space station,

412
00:25:07.931 --> 00:25:12.190
you using a combination of ultrasound and infrared and a very fixed two meter by

413
00:25:12.191 --> 00:25:14.090
two meter volume inside one of the modules,

414
00:25:14.091 --> 00:25:16.990
that space station and that's how it knows where it is and where it's going.

415
00:25:17.260 --> 00:25:20.860
With that cat.
With that,
uh,
project tango smartphone attached to it,

416
00:25:21.040 --> 00:25:25.210
it was able to generate three d maps of its environment and then venture outside

417
00:25:25.211 --> 00:25:28.270
its comfort zone and a navigate using just the camera.

418
00:25:28.630 --> 00:25:30.550
So very exciting research being done there.

419
00:25:30.700 --> 00:25:33.570
And a lot of the same technology developed on,
uh,

420
00:25:33.790 --> 00:25:38.380
this platform went on to be used in not android or asked to be.

421
00:25:39.610 --> 00:25:40.960
So why look at free flyers?

422
00:25:41.360 --> 00:25:45.160
I think I've covered a lot of the foundation foundational research being done

423
00:25:45.161 --> 00:25:47.500
using free flowers like slash rings,

424
00:25:47.630 --> 00:25:51.400
all these things advancing our knowledge of how things operate in space.

425
00:25:51.760 --> 00:25:55.420
And a again,
benefits,
uh,
payoff.
Uh,
uh,

426
00:25:55.450 --> 00:25:58.560
even in the short term with some of the large providers that have all,
uh,

427
00:25:58.570 --> 00:26:03.130
utilize some of the results from that investigation.
But then,
um,
uh,

428
00:26:03.160 --> 00:26:07.180
that just pays dividends down the road.
And then of course,
as a robotic platform,

429
00:26:07.181 --> 00:26:10.850
how can we support crew members in a spacecraft to,
uh,

430
00:26:11.020 --> 00:26:14.330
do more things in an automated way and not have to,
uh,

431
00:26:14.470 --> 00:26:18.250
use crew to do all the maintenance on space station,
right?

432
00:26:18.910 --> 00:26:22.000
These are just some numbers looking at how much time can be saved.

433
00:26:22.000 --> 00:26:25.150
We're crew can spend more of their time doing the important research and less of

434
00:26:25.151 --> 00:26:28.480
their time maintaining the spacecraft and turning very important to if we're

435
00:26:28.481 --> 00:26:31.590
going to start looking at deep space applications where,
um,

436
00:26:31.870 --> 00:26:35.480
it's important that a spacecraft be a lot more automated,
uh,

437
00:26:35.650 --> 00:26:39.340
and not as a complicated to operate frankly because there's only so many crew

438
00:26:39.341 --> 00:26:42.220
members that are going to be on a,
on a deep space,

439
00:26:42.510 --> 00:26:45.810
spacecraft and along communication delay from,
from Earth.

440
00:26:46.170 --> 00:26:49.170
So now I get to ask to be some of the really exciting stuff we're working on

441
00:26:49.171 --> 00:26:51.330
today.
Uh,
just a overview,

442
00:26:51.990 --> 00:26:55.410
there will be three attributes on the space station and I'll get to some videos

443
00:26:55.411 --> 00:26:59.970
showing some demos of them in operation in our lab.
Um,
uh,

444
00:26:59.971 --> 00:27:04.590
to be operated in 2008.
We're going to launch it hopefully by summer next year,

445
00:27:04.830 --> 00:27:08.760
uh,
commission and installed on space station and then fully operational by late

446
00:27:08.761 --> 00:27:10.570
2018,
um,

447
00:27:11.130 --> 00:27:14.730
where it's then available for guests research and for all kinds of people to use

448
00:27:14.731 --> 00:27:19.340
it as a robotic platform on,
on space station.
Six total cameras,
uh,

449
00:27:19.350 --> 00:27:23.850
unlike spheres asked to be,
will be entirely vision based navigation,
um,

450
00:27:24.000 --> 00:27:27.090
to operate anywhere in the u s o s section of Iss.

451
00:27:27.091 --> 00:27:31.710
So that's basically anywhere but the Japanese,
uh,
or,
uh,
Russian segment of,

452
00:27:31.711 --> 00:27:32.550
of space station.

453
00:27:32.730 --> 00:27:36.420
So that really opens up what it can do on space station and supporting what it

454
00:27:36.421 --> 00:27:39.210
can do.
One of its big goals being a,
again,

455
00:27:39.211 --> 00:27:42.030
replacing spheres as a research platform on space station,

456
00:27:42.270 --> 00:27:45.600
but also serving as a mobile camera platform because it has a lot of really

457
00:27:45.601 --> 00:27:50.130
great cameras on it.
It can automate the camera views and,
uh,

458
00:27:50.131 --> 00:27:53.700
a lot of the mobile camera tasks that astronauts actually have to do every time

459
00:27:53.910 --> 00:27:57.960
they repositioned cameras that were crown control can get good views of what's

460
00:27:57.961 --> 00:28:02.730
going on on space station as well as being a,
a mobile sensor platform.

461
00:28:02.940 --> 00:28:04.500
With this little free flying robot,

462
00:28:04.501 --> 00:28:08.640
we can not take measurement all across ISS measurements like Co2,

463
00:28:08.790 --> 00:28:13.170
radiation,
all kinds of things,
uh,
audio type sensing.
These are things,

464
00:28:13.171 --> 00:28:15.600
crew spend a good amount of time going around in space station,

465
00:28:15.660 --> 00:28:20.050
taking measurements and something that a robot can do instead.
Uh,

466
00:28:20.380 --> 00:28:22.490
one comparison I like to make is,
is uh,

467
00:28:22.500 --> 00:28:25.620
asked to be as a lot like the Roomba of this space station,
right?

468
00:28:25.621 --> 00:28:30.510
We have little robots that can automate a lot of these menial tasks,
um,
uh,

469
00:28:30.511 --> 00:28:32.670
and asked her,
we can do down on the space station.

470
00:28:33.910 --> 00:28:34.730
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

471
00:28:34.730 --> 00:28:36.740
<v 2>Some of the design drivers,
uh,</v>

472
00:28:37.040 --> 00:28:41.200
designed to be a multifunctional in a lot of different scenarios.
Um,

473
00:28:41.690 --> 00:28:45.610
general navigation across space station,
darking perching,
uh,

474
00:28:45.620 --> 00:28:49.950
conducting a science,
um,
a platform,

475
00:28:49.951 --> 00:28:53.840
something we learned from spheres was it's important to be modular,
extensible,

476
00:28:54.090 --> 00:28:56.720
a new thing can get it add added onto it.

477
00:28:58.520 --> 00:29:01.490
Current or robot design.
Um,
12,

478
00:29:01.580 --> 00:29:06.350
roughly 12 by 12 by 12 inches,
12.5 inches cubed.
Uh,

479
00:29:06.410 --> 00:29:09.260
targeting 10 kilograms is actually as little outdated.

480
00:29:09.450 --> 00:29:14.060
A 10 kilograms in mass is a target,
uh,
for its size and mass.

481
00:29:14.420 --> 00:29:18.910
And here are different,
um,
aspects of Astra be,
uh,

482
00:29:18.920 --> 00:29:21.800
unlike spheres.
Uh,
it moves around using a blower.

483
00:29:21.801 --> 00:29:23.940
So it's fear as you compress here to ask,

484
00:29:23.980 --> 00:29:28.980
he's using a blower to second error in its sides and um,

485
00:29:30.290 --> 00:29:32.240
uh,
expel the air out different vents.

486
00:29:32.241 --> 00:29:35.990
You can see different events on different sides of a [inaudible] where it lets

487
00:29:35.991 --> 00:29:39.260
out the air,
the a two boxes on both sides.

488
00:29:39.261 --> 00:29:44.261
That sandwich has to be a pressure up to about 0.1 psi and generate the force

489
00:29:44.891 --> 00:29:48.370
that way where the flaps on the,
uh,

490
00:29:49.290 --> 00:29:53.470
on the sides there open up and allow variable thrust in any given direction,

491
00:29:53.471 --> 00:29:56.260
which is what really gives it a Tom holonomics emotion.

492
00:29:56.530 --> 00:30:00.070
It does have a purchasing arm which allows it to perch on the hand rails inside

493
00:30:00.071 --> 00:30:03.460
of space station and really gives it its pan until it functionality for his

494
00:30:03.461 --> 00:30:07.010
camera.
So we can then in a very automated way,
uh,
uh,

495
00:30:07.060 --> 00:30:10.630
perch anywhere on space station and get great angles and visibility into what's

496
00:30:10.631 --> 00:30:12.490
going on in space station.

497
00:30:13.400 --> 00:30:14.090
<v 1>Yeah,</v>

498
00:30:14.090 --> 00:30:18.390
<v 2>a basic pack packaging,
uh,
looks like this,</v>

499
00:30:18.540 --> 00:30:21.060
the colorings can be a bit different.
Um,
we're,

500
00:30:21.210 --> 00:30:25.920
we're not working on the actual flight units that don't end up flying next year.

501
00:30:26.100 --> 00:30:29.850
And these are a lot of renderings and basic concepts,
uh,

502
00:30:30.120 --> 00:30:33.960
showing where the batteries going turn signals with something that moves around

503
00:30:33.970 --> 00:30:37.830
in a full high anomic motion.
How do you convey to crew where it's going,

504
00:30:37.831 --> 00:30:41.130
what it's doing with cars were used to turn signals that go left or right,

505
00:30:41.270 --> 00:30:44.610
but it's something that can go up,
down,
left,
right forward after,
you know,

506
00:30:44.611 --> 00:30:48.310
how do you communicate these intentions to crew?
So this is a whole area of,
uh,

507
00:30:48.510 --> 00:30:53.460
research where people are looking at human robot interaction and how do you

508
00:30:53.461 --> 00:30:54.870
communicate these things to each other?

509
00:30:54.960 --> 00:30:59.760
How do you optimize that relationship of crew and robots working together to

510
00:31:00.570 --> 00:31:01.890
achieve greater things?

511
00:31:03.080 --> 00:31:03.913
<v 1>Yeah,</v>

512
00:31:03.930 --> 00:31:06.990
<v 2>some of the indicators,
it will have a touch screen on the front,
uh,</v>

513
00:31:06.991 --> 00:31:10.620
together with a speaker,
a microphone,
a laser pointer,

514
00:31:10.890 --> 00:31:12.210
a indicator lights,

515
00:31:12.420 --> 00:31:16.200
a lot of different other elements that make asked to be a lot more interactive

516
00:31:16.320 --> 00:31:20.670
and certainly a lot more robotic in nature so it can interact with crew and be a

517
00:31:20.671 --> 00:31:23.580
true,
uh,
assistant on the space station

518
00:31:25.640 --> 00:31:29.590
proportion.
I mentioned it uses this impeller,
um,
that,
uh,

519
00:31:29.591 --> 00:31:32.710
as it turned out was a more efficient means of propulsion inside of the space

520
00:31:32.711 --> 00:31:36.410
station.
Um,
not so great for outside the space station though.

521
00:31:37.780 --> 00:31:42.640
Um,
some of the nozzles and their location,
there is a preferred direction.

522
00:31:42.880 --> 00:31:43.031
Uh,

523
00:31:43.031 --> 00:31:45.970
you can tell the nozzles on the front and back are a little bit bigger and then

524
00:31:45.971 --> 00:31:50.070
you've got more of them in that direction so you can get bigger,
uh,

525
00:31:50.290 --> 00:31:55.000
forces and motions and forward or aft.
Um,
as well as better sensing,

526
00:31:55.030 --> 00:31:58.600
we have some different cameras,
uh,
that,
um,

527
00:31:59.160 --> 00:32:04.160
<v 1>[inaudible]</v>

528
00:32:06.630 --> 00:32:07.381
<v 2>there you go.
Some,</v>

529
00:32:07.381 --> 00:32:12.060
a video of a concept of how the turn signals are going to operate,
uh,
on the,

530
00:32:12.061 --> 00:32:16.050
uh,
aster be computing.
Uh,
it,
unlike spheres,

531
00:32:16.051 --> 00:32:19.140
it's going to have three Co uh,
cell phone class processors,

532
00:32:19.141 --> 00:32:24.050
arm architecture processors capable of doing a lot of competing,
uh,
uh,

533
00:32:24.150 --> 00:32:29.070
high level,
mid level and low level processor.
Um,
that,
uh,

534
00:32:29.100 --> 00:32:30.000
we'll do all the computing,

535
00:32:30.001 --> 00:32:32.370
the low level process or doing a lot of the low level control,

536
00:32:32.640 --> 00:32:34.620
allow the GNC work of navigation,

537
00:32:34.770 --> 00:32:39.240
the mid level processor doing allow the vision based navigation processing

538
00:32:39.530 --> 00:32:41.090
camera,
video,
um,

539
00:32:41.091 --> 00:32:44.690
and then the high level process or dedicated almost entirely to get science

540
00:32:44.691 --> 00:32:45.410
research.

541
00:32:45.410 --> 00:32:48.920
And it's that high level processor that so running an android operating system

542
00:32:49.130 --> 00:32:49.570
where guests,

543
00:32:49.570 --> 00:32:54.440
scientists can design apps basically that get the up thing to space station and

544
00:32:54.441 --> 00:32:58.600
can operate Astra be in any custom way.
They they like uh,

545
00:32:58.640 --> 00:33:03.350
power systems.
Uh,
it does recharge.
It does have a docking station,
um,

546
00:33:04.280 --> 00:33:06.950
power system,
14 volt batteries for them.

547
00:33:06.951 --> 00:33:11.510
That gives it a roughly two to four hour operating time inside the space
station,

548
00:33:12.860 --> 00:33:15.440
a avionics stack.
A lot of these things,
uh,

549
00:33:15.500 --> 00:33:18.650
as we've learned have been designed to be modular and replaceable.
Right?

550
00:33:18.651 --> 00:33:21.380
Things break,
things get upgraded.
Uh,

551
00:33:21.470 --> 00:33:24.620
we're close to launching these on space station and the avionics are already

552
00:33:24.621 --> 00:33:25.454
outdated,
right?

553
00:33:25.550 --> 00:33:28.850
So there'll be come a time when we want to update a lot of the avionics,
uh,

554
00:33:29.270 --> 00:33:32.450
and a hardware.
I mentioned a lot of cameras.

555
00:33:32.720 --> 00:33:36.710
There are cameras pointing forward and aft,
uh,
has cam perching cam.

556
00:33:36.711 --> 00:33:40.900
Our Three d imaging sensor is very similar to connect or some of the uh,

557
00:33:41.060 --> 00:33:45.410
previous smartphone cameras that can give you three d mapping maps of your

558
00:33:45.411 --> 00:33:48.950
environment and those are used for purchasing onto hand rails as well as docking

559
00:33:48.951 --> 00:33:51.320
onto the a docking station.
Um,

560
00:33:51.410 --> 00:33:55.190
psych cam HD camera for visualizing things on the ground that gives,

561
00:33:55.250 --> 00:33:57.470
does get stream to a ground,

562
00:33:57.830 --> 00:34:02.810
a gooey external sensors,
uh,
that gives it the imu,

563
00:34:02.811 --> 00:34:04.250
the speed Cam.
Uh,

564
00:34:04.251 --> 00:34:08.000
these actually are all the cameras and their capabilities as I mentioned,

565
00:34:08.001 --> 00:34:11.360
flight software.
Um,
the,
uh,

566
00:34:11.660 --> 00:34:15.200
the architectures is largely based on Ros,
the robot operating system.

567
00:34:15.201 --> 00:34:19.220
It's an open source software platform for doing this kind of our robotics

568
00:34:19.221 --> 00:34:23.570
research and certainly why they use in,
in academia for robotics.

569
00:34:23.720 --> 00:34:27.720
And it's what ties together a lot of five software that operates on,
on Astro.
B.

570
00:34:30.110 --> 00:34:34.890
As I mentioned,
uh,
all three processors,
uh,
are running the mid level,

571
00:34:35.270 --> 00:34:39.980
low level running Linux,
a high level of what running android,
um,

572
00:34:40.310 --> 00:34:43.540
low level control loop barbering at 100 Hertz,
uh,
in,

573
00:34:43.580 --> 00:34:47.400
in tune with the IMU and a lot of the high rate information,
um,

574
00:34:48.820 --> 00:34:50.570
uh,
system data flow diagram,

575
00:34:50.600 --> 00:34:54.140
talking about the way the different processes inside the,
uh,

576
00:34:54.300 --> 00:34:57.390
Astro beat communicate with each other over an internal network.
Um,

577
00:34:57.430 --> 00:35:01.980
and then together with the other three units,
uh,
I will highlight the names as,

578
00:35:02.000 --> 00:35:05.720
as the project is called Honeybee,
the unique names for each unit.

579
00:35:05.740 --> 00:35:10.310
I have been picked out to be a queen bee,
a honeybee and Bumblebee.
Uh,

580
00:35:10.311 --> 00:35:13.250
so riffing on that,
a whole team there.
Um,

581
00:35:14.090 --> 00:35:17.000
and then we've got a whole other set of interesting name for the ground units as

582
00:35:17.001 --> 00:35:20.450
well.
And I can get into that if you ask.
Um,

583
00:35:20.600 --> 00:35:25.000
so here just also showing communication,
uh,
with ground control stations,
uh,

584
00:35:25.040 --> 00:35:26.240
both at uh,

585
00:35:26.270 --> 00:35:29.900
JSC where they have the mission control center as well as Marshall where they do

586
00:35:29.901 --> 00:35:31.560
a lot of the payload commanding.
Um,

587
00:35:31.640 --> 00:35:34.940
and then our mission operation center here at Nasa Ames.
Uh,

588
00:35:34.941 --> 00:35:36.530
and then in addition to that,

589
00:35:36.590 --> 00:35:40.140
we can ground control stations at guests science facilities.

590
00:35:40.290 --> 00:35:43.860
So whether that's at a university,
a school,
uh,
your garage,

591
00:35:43.980 --> 00:35:47.900
we can operate Astra beef from a lot of different unique locations.
Um,

592
00:35:47.940 --> 00:35:52.140
really enabling some rapid design and testing on space station.

593
00:35:53.180 --> 00:35:53.581
Again,

594
00:35:53.581 --> 00:35:58.080
covering a lot of communication over the network interfaces on space station,

595
00:35:58.320 --> 00:36:01.470
the purchasing arm,
two degrees of freedom there.
Um,

596
00:36:01.920 --> 00:36:06.450
that allows it to pan and tilt,
uh,
its view on a space station.

597
00:36:08.860 --> 00:36:10.590
Uh,
more renderings of the purchasing arm.

598
00:36:10.591 --> 00:36:15.180
I'm going to go ahead and skip through a lot of these payload layout.
Uh,
again,

599
00:36:15.210 --> 00:36:18.150
very extensible.
We've got three,
a what we referred to as one,

600
00:36:18.151 --> 00:36:22.820
you a payload bays where external hardware can be attached on to spheres and to

601
00:36:22.821 --> 00:36:23.980
expand his capability.

602
00:36:23.981 --> 00:36:27.780
So you want to put special sensors better as bitter or better audio equipment

603
00:36:28.020 --> 00:36:32.790
that can be done using expansion ports as well as its mechanical loading bays

604
00:36:32.791 --> 00:36:36.680
there,
uh,
where you can even utilize more than one for one unit.
If you add,

605
00:36:36.950 --> 00:36:38.760
if you need more space to do that,

606
00:36:39.390 --> 00:36:43.080
does have a docking station where it can I go back just like a Roomba,
go back,

607
00:36:43.081 --> 00:36:46.730
recharge and then go back out and carry on operations.
Uh,

608
00:36:46.900 --> 00:36:51.240
that's where it can recharge,
communicate,
uh,
over a hard link down to the ground.

609
00:36:51.630 --> 00:36:56.190
Um,
uh,
you can see a little air tags on,
on the uh,

610
00:36:56.670 --> 00:36:58.380
uh,
docking station there.

611
00:36:58.620 --> 00:37:02.430
One thing I didn't touch on with different approaches to vision based
navigation,

612
00:37:02.640 --> 00:37:06.750
one is a general sparse mapping where it's looking at different features it sees

613
00:37:06.751 --> 00:37:11.070
across ISS,
mapping that against a known map,
uh,

614
00:37:11.100 --> 00:37:14.550
a priori where it matches up different features and that gives it a decent

615
00:37:14.551 --> 00:37:18.420
navigation across ISS when it comes to docking onto the docking station.
However,

616
00:37:18.600 --> 00:37:20.970
it uses a different approach utilizing ar tags,

617
00:37:20.971 --> 00:37:24.330
which gives it the better accuracy,
uh,
of being able to calculate.

618
00:37:24.331 --> 00:37:28.350
It's posed and its position with respect to those ar tax on the,

619
00:37:28.500 --> 00:37:29.550
on the dock.

620
00:37:29.700 --> 00:37:33.000
And in fact we have concepts of being able to put those ar tags in different

621
00:37:33.001 --> 00:37:36.990
parts of space station where I guessed scientist might want that a centimeter

622
00:37:36.991 --> 00:37:40.240
level accuracy of knowing where the attribute is,
um,

623
00:37:40.320 --> 00:37:42.600
and different research that calls for that.
Uh,

624
00:37:42.620 --> 00:37:47.340
and then yet another third approach.
The vision navigation is those three,

625
00:37:47.520 --> 00:37:51.750
uh,
hazard cameras that can generate three d maps of its environment,
um,

626
00:37:51.930 --> 00:37:56.120
and do the,
uh,
uh,
docking onto the dock as well as the,
uh,
uh,

627
00:37:56.160 --> 00:37:59.880
hand rails when it comes to purchasing a control station,

628
00:37:59.910 --> 00:38:02.410
a gooeys being designed that can operate,
uh,

629
00:38:02.430 --> 00:38:05.760
not just up the mission control center,
but also at our,
uh,

630
00:38:05.850 --> 00:38:07.470
mission operation center.
Um,

631
00:38:07.590 --> 00:38:10.710
that gives users access to ask to be on space station.

632
00:38:10.950 --> 00:38:14.670
And one of the key features is being able to vary the level of autonomy,
right?

633
00:38:14.760 --> 00:38:18.030
We can do anything from RC control these things on space station,

634
00:38:18.180 --> 00:38:20.460
even with the delay involved with communications,

635
00:38:20.461 --> 00:38:24.510
a space station or in a completely automated way kickoff,
uh,

636
00:38:24.540 --> 00:38:28.640
plans and different things.
Uh,
uh,
where they operating all by themselves on,

637
00:38:28.690 --> 00:38:30.360
on space station.
So we can vary that,

638
00:38:30.390 --> 00:38:33.060
the level of autonomy from beginning to end.

639
00:38:35.140 --> 00:38:38.230
A quick little video of to be operating in our lab.

640
00:38:38.350 --> 00:38:41.410
What you're seeing here is actually our granite table,
uh,

641
00:38:41.411 --> 00:38:45.360
where we can do this kind of testing in our lab were asked to,

642
00:38:45.370 --> 00:38:47.860
we can move around in an almost friction free environment.

643
00:38:48.010 --> 00:38:52.090
Very similar to how it operates on up on a space station.
Um,

644
00:38:52.120 --> 00:38:56.290
and like I was talking about earlier with our Gantry Michael Gregory test

645
00:38:56.291 --> 00:38:59.260
facility,
we have the world's greatest a crane game.

646
00:38:59.440 --> 00:39:01.840
While here we have the world's greatest air hockey table.

647
00:39:01.841 --> 00:39:05.620
If you guys have played air hockey at the arcades basic same basic concept,

648
00:39:05.621 --> 00:39:09.070
we have an air carriage with compress CEO two that forms that cushion of air

649
00:39:09.071 --> 00:39:12.040
between that our carriage and there's very flat,
very smooth,

650
00:39:12.320 --> 00:39:16.150
a granite table that's less than the papers with difference from corner to

651
00:39:16.151 --> 00:39:20.770
corner that allows us bias free motion across the table just like you would

652
00:39:20.771 --> 00:39:22.600
experience on a space station.

653
00:39:23.770 --> 00:39:27.280
And so what you're seeing here is asked to be using its vision based navigation

654
00:39:27.281 --> 00:39:30.670
to navigate,
uh,
across this volume,
um,

655
00:39:30.850 --> 00:39:35.200
using it's a cameras.
You see the camera from,
uh,
the uh,

656
00:39:35.230 --> 00:39:36.960
top a ceiling,
uh,

657
00:39:37.030 --> 00:39:40.870
giving us an outside observation of where it is in the volume so that we can

658
00:39:40.871 --> 00:39:44.560
better characterize,
it's built in a navigation.

659
00:39:45.130 --> 00:39:48.370
There you see a camera views,
uh,
from uh,

660
00:39:48.610 --> 00:39:51.190
onboard and a what it seen.

661
00:39:53.810 --> 00:39:56.480
Dan's doing a basic eight maneuver there.

662
00:40:04.770 --> 00:40:05.010
And,

663
00:40:05.010 --> 00:40:09.340
and one thing you're not hearing on this video is the flapping and the worrying

664
00:40:09.341 --> 00:40:10.180
of its motors.

665
00:40:10.360 --> 00:40:13.150
And that was actually what a big challenge in designing a free flyer that

666
00:40:13.151 --> 00:40:16.990
operates using a blower is keeping its noise level down.
As you can imagine,

667
00:40:16.991 --> 00:40:20.230
operating on space station could get kind of noisy and you don't want to be

668
00:40:20.231 --> 00:40:23.950
living and working in a place that sounds like a factory all day,
every day.

669
00:40:24.130 --> 00:40:27.770
So they do keep strict limits on the amount of noise you can generate on,

670
00:40:27.780 --> 00:40:32.070
on space station.
And so,
uh,
we,
uh,
from the get go,
uh,

671
00:40:32.140 --> 00:40:35.620
looked at designing the blowers to operate at certain speeds.

672
00:40:35.770 --> 00:40:40.690
And then the flaps not to generate a undue amounts of noise.
Um,

673
00:40:40.960 --> 00:40:43.450
but certainly a challenge with this type of propulsion.

674
00:40:45.490 --> 00:40:49.110
And here you can see it to executing a docking maneuver,
uh,

675
00:40:49.250 --> 00:40:51.820
using those ar tags I was referring to earlier.

676
00:41:06.530 --> 00:41:07.363
<v 1>Okay.</v>

677
00:41:10.130 --> 00:41:14.860
<v 2>I'm going to speed this up a little bit.
Get to another section.
Ah,
I,</v>

678
00:41:14.890 --> 00:41:18.710
I talked about the macro gravity test facility,
the,
the road graders crane game.

679
00:41:18.980 --> 00:41:19.813
This is it.

680
00:41:20.150 --> 00:41:23.690
So we have this gantry moving around just like you saw earlier with the PSA free

681
00:41:23.691 --> 00:41:27.450
flour.
We've revamped that facility to be able to test up the,
uh,

682
00:41:27.470 --> 00:41:29.240
asked to be avionics unit.

683
00:41:29.390 --> 00:41:32.420
And this is very important for testing out that vision based navigation on the

684
00:41:32.421 --> 00:41:36.370
ground,
right where we can have a camera in the loop.
Um,
when,
uh,

685
00:41:36.380 --> 00:41:37.760
navigating across a,

686
00:41:38.090 --> 00:41:42.190
a environment that's visually similar to a space station.
Uh,

687
00:41:42.200 --> 00:41:46.220
we do have a simulator that's a now released an open source that has a,

688
00:41:46.221 --> 00:41:48.890
a lot of the flight software involved,
but uh,

689
00:41:48.891 --> 00:41:51.170
it's hard to replace doing a lot of hardware in the loop.
Uh,

690
00:41:51.171 --> 00:41:54.990
in particular with the camera,
uh,
in a full six degree of freedom motion,
uh,

691
00:41:55.010 --> 00:41:56.780
across the volume there.

692
00:41:58.240 --> 00:41:58.760
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

693
00:41:58.760 --> 00:42:03.350
<v 2>How do you use aster be?
So it's not limited to NASA government agencies.</v>

694
00:42:03.500 --> 00:42:07.440
It's available to you guys as,
as tax paying citizens.
Uh,

695
00:42:07.490 --> 00:42:10.430
you have access to this facility on the space station and if you have

696
00:42:10.431 --> 00:42:15.260
interesting research,
uh,
uh,
please let me know.
We're open to new research.

697
00:42:15.410 --> 00:42:19.480
So there is an API being designed that would allow that a guest science to

698
00:42:19.481 --> 00:42:22.540
operate on a high level processor as well as anywhere in the ass,

699
00:42:22.550 --> 00:42:25.760
Ruby and none of the software being designed on asked to be,
um,

700
00:42:25.770 --> 00:42:27.380
is deemed safety critical,

701
00:42:27.500 --> 00:42:31.430
which allows us to very quickly iterate on the software on Astro B so we can

702
00:42:31.431 --> 00:42:36.090
come up with new ideas,
updates,
pushed them up to the hard Ron space station,
uh,

703
00:42:36.100 --> 00:42:40.280
with in very little amount of time with um,
uh,
because it's not safety critical,

704
00:42:40.281 --> 00:42:45.120
right?
We can iterate,
we can afford to fail,
we can afford to have mistakes,
uh,
uh,

705
00:42:45.330 --> 00:42:49.980
occasionally.
And so this describes some of the API features,
uh,

706
00:42:49.981 --> 00:42:51.720
the simulator now released on gay.

707
00:42:51.721 --> 00:42:56.660
How about I encourage you guys to check it out?
Um,
being a facility open to,
uh,

708
00:42:56.690 --> 00:42:57.980
researchers,
uh,

709
00:42:58.010 --> 00:43:02.420
we're trying to release as much documentation and a software as possible for

710
00:43:02.810 --> 00:43:04.580
other people to take advantage of it.

711
00:43:04.850 --> 00:43:08.390
Here's some architecture talking about what the simulator does.
Um,

712
00:43:08.450 --> 00:43:11.940
simulating a lot of the fights offer stack built into the answer B unit.
Uh,

713
00:43:11.980 --> 00:43:15.290
and then this shows it talking to the ground control station.
Uh,

714
00:43:15.560 --> 00:43:20.220
here's some video of it in operation to go with Gazebo,
the three d animation.

715
00:43:20.610 --> 00:43:25.350
Um,
this video unfortunate isn't too detailed.
You can kind of see,
uh,

716
00:43:25.370 --> 00:43:29.660
the code and then a,
uh,
android emulator operating words,

717
00:43:29.750 --> 00:43:33.650
operating the,
uh,
uh,
uh,
very hello world type APP,

718
00:43:33.860 --> 00:43:37.490
communicating to the rest of the flights after has to be,

719
00:43:37.760 --> 00:43:42.080
and then communicating motion commands to the Astro B unit in,
in a moment.

720
00:43:42.710 --> 00:43:45.890
If I speed it up a little bit,
you'll see it motion there on the bottom.

721
00:43:45.891 --> 00:43:46.820
It's a little hard to see,

722
00:43:47.480 --> 00:43:50.390
but there it is traversing the three d environment there.

723
00:43:54.800 --> 00:43:57.200
Uh,
as I said,
we have a guest scientist program.
Uh,

724
00:43:57.210 --> 00:44:01.260
we have a lot of experience from spheres and supporting people using this

725
00:44:01.261 --> 00:44:04.340
facility on space station.
So fast tracking the process,
um,

726
00:44:04.620 --> 00:44:09.130
and navigating the ISS payload process of getting real research done on,

727
00:44:09.140 --> 00:44:12.370
on space station,
uh,
different,
uh,

728
00:44:12.480 --> 00:44:15.720
phases of that kind of a good scientist program.
Uh,

729
00:44:15.730 --> 00:44:17.640
invite you guys to check it out later on.

730
00:44:18.180 --> 00:44:21.810
Just some overview of the different testing facilities we have at NASA ames.

731
00:44:21.811 --> 00:44:25.530
We've covered the granted table,
the uh,
MTTF,

732
00:44:25.800 --> 00:44:28.500
the flight line where we built flight hardware,
environmental testing,

733
00:44:28.501 --> 00:44:31.600
and then of course our mission operations center,
which is a,

734
00:44:32.070 --> 00:44:34.730
a nice computer lab where we are,
uh,

735
00:44:34.770 --> 00:44:38.340
interact with the astronauts during the test session on,
on the space station.

736
00:44:38.550 --> 00:44:41.160
So that's a really cool part of this facility.

737
00:44:41.161 --> 00:44:43.800
We get to interact with the astronauts on the space station.

738
00:44:43.950 --> 00:44:46.830
So what are we doing in the future?
We're already looking at,
uh,

739
00:44:46.980 --> 00:44:50.230
a lot of interested users wanting to you as an aster beyond space.

740
00:44:50.260 --> 00:44:52.060
You to do some really cool research.
Our,

741
00:44:52.080 --> 00:44:55.450
there's a group at JSC and looking at RFID logistics tracking.
Uh,

742
00:44:55.451 --> 00:45:00.000
you can think of ISS as a five bedroom house where the family changes out every

743
00:45:00.360 --> 00:45:04.290
six months,
right?
I certainly lose stuff in my house.
It's uh,

744
00:45:04.310 --> 00:45:07.170
they do lose things on space station.
So logistics,
tracking,

745
00:45:07.200 --> 00:45:09.600
tracking of different things on space stations that are very important thing.

746
00:45:09.720 --> 00:45:12.090
It's something they spend a lot of time on doing.
If asked to be,

747
00:45:12.091 --> 00:45:15.990
can be designed with a RFID tracker along with tagging of different objects on

748
00:45:15.991 --> 00:45:19.830
space station,
that can be a big help in that regard.
Deep audio analytics,

749
00:45:19.831 --> 00:45:22.860
we're working with a bionic Bosh and Astrobotic,
uh,

750
00:45:22.861 --> 00:45:26.430
at looking at custom Bosh,
um,
uh,

751
00:45:26.460 --> 00:45:31.290
audio sensing that can try to characterize the audio environment and then

752
00:45:31.291 --> 00:45:36.291
perhaps even a diagnose and identify off nominal conditions on the space

753
00:45:36.331 --> 00:45:40.680
station.
A very useful for a continued operation of,
of space station,

754
00:45:40.950 --> 00:45:43.410
but certainly an area of research and something.
Um,
uh,

755
00:45:43.600 --> 00:45:46.980
they're very interested in a o two monitors as I referred to earlier.

756
00:45:46.981 --> 00:45:51.690
There's people at JC looking at,
um,
uh,
crew radiation exposure,
uh,

757
00:45:51.710 --> 00:45:55.830
CO2,
a three d camera payloads.
People want to do three 60 vision,

758
00:45:56.610 --> 00:45:59.960
all kinds of really cool research.
They're different companies looking at,
uh,

759
00:46:00.150 --> 00:46:04.950
not just RFID sensors but are afraid the applicator's how'd he go around,
uh,
uh,

760
00:46:05.310 --> 00:46:07.510
tagging different things on space station,
uh,

761
00:46:07.520 --> 00:46:10.140
advanced a manipulators gimbals arms.

762
00:46:10.260 --> 00:46:15.260
How can we build a free flour that's more interactive and more manipulative on

763
00:46:15.631 --> 00:46:19.410
its environment,
right?
How can you get them to doc or a manipulative?

764
00:46:19.411 --> 00:46:23.120
And things on,
on space station and do and do some real active work.
Uh,

765
00:46:23.190 --> 00:46:27.510
with advanced docking interfaces.
Uh,
there's some,
uh,
researchers looking at Deco,

766
00:46:27.511 --> 00:46:31.230
inspired a appendages that can attach onto different things,

767
00:46:31.350 --> 00:46:35.430
move things around and affect things in a microgravity environment.

768
00:46:36.680 --> 00:46:39.930
I do some other areas of research that people are looking at formation flight

769
00:46:40.110 --> 00:46:43.920
again at dancing,
uh,
the state of the art in that area.
Robotic manipulation,

770
00:46:44.130 --> 00:46:47.400
human robot interaction,
things I've touched on in the past.

771
00:46:47.850 --> 00:46:52.230
And so that,
let me first preface this next video.

772
00:46:52.380 --> 00:46:57.100
As I mentioned earlier on a stem outreach is a big part of,
uh,

773
00:46:57.180 --> 00:47:01.130
what we do as well.
And uh,
right now the,
the,

774
00:47:01.180 --> 00:47:03.180
the greatest game in town is called zero robotics,

775
00:47:03.181 --> 00:47:08.160
led by MIT first operated on this on spheres.
Uh,
this is a program,
well,

776
00:47:08.161 --> 00:47:08.491
actually,

777
00:47:08.491 --> 00:47:11.640
let me just jump to the video because it does a lot better job explaining this

778
00:47:11.641 --> 00:47:12.474
than the Nivea.

779
00:47:14.400 --> 00:47:17.370
<v 5>A real engineer doesn't answer.
Why not?</v>

780
00:47:18.790 --> 00:47:23.790
I really engineered answers how we're running these educational playgrounds

781
00:47:25.330 --> 00:47:27.820
where kids are getting an experience.

782
00:47:27.850 --> 00:47:32.320
Even in middle school of working in a team where they really care about what

783
00:47:32.321 --> 00:47:35.170
happens.
This is an incredible competition.

784
00:47:35.580 --> 00:47:39.880
They got teams all around the world involved programming satellites.

785
00:47:40.120 --> 00:47:42.370
We can have kids on the ground,

786
00:47:42.850 --> 00:47:47.770
send their codes up to the space station and we can run contests on the space

787
00:47:47.771 --> 00:47:48.604
station.

788
00:47:52.140 --> 00:47:52.973
<v 1>Okay.</v>

789
00:47:53.370 --> 00:47:57.120
<v 6>You don't have anybody else you can turn to except each other.</v>

790
00:48:00.030 --> 00:48:01.980
Welcome to Mit,
El Jaleo.

791
00:48:02.640 --> 00:48:03.473
<v 1>Pardon?</v>

792
00:48:17.570 --> 00:48:20.420
<v 5>We've got half of high school students grade whatever software they want and</v>

793
00:48:20.421 --> 00:48:24.680
it's very risk tolerant.
You don't say that normally with a space system.

794
00:48:24.770 --> 00:48:27.230
Since we have multiple versions of our code running,

795
00:48:27.231 --> 00:48:30.530
it's very important to us to know all the cases.

796
00:48:31.090 --> 00:48:34.730
What will work in each and every scenario.
Um,
I'm a sophomore in high school,

797
00:48:34.731 --> 00:48:38.180
so I'm 15 years old.
Actually,
my birthday was in December,
so he's 10 15.

798
00:48:39.020 --> 00:48:40.280
When we'd go to Mars,

799
00:48:40.400 --> 00:48:43.130
one of the things we would want to do is set up a GPS system.

800
00:48:43.310 --> 00:48:47.750
So in this year's game we had them deployed three satellites that would be able

801
00:48:47.751 --> 00:48:50.930
to triangulate,
just like GPS triangulate.

802
00:48:51.830 --> 00:48:55.760
Once these spheres were in space.
The only thing going up and down,

803
00:48:59.270 --> 00:49:01.970
<v 6>let's go ahead for the rock.
Okay.</v>

804
00:49:02.470 --> 00:49:06.670
<v 7>In the game they have to position the GPS system and then grab the things and</v>

805
00:49:06.671 --> 00:49:11.500
bring them to an assembly area so that they could actually be control in our

806
00:49:11.501 --> 00:49:15.610
strategy is that utilize our quick movement speed to get an early lead and we

807
00:49:15.611 --> 00:49:19.180
spend the rest of the game guarding our zone or blocking the o team from putting

808
00:49:19.240 --> 00:49:22.630
items in their zone to keep our lead and hopefully win the game.

809
00:49:24.110 --> 00:49:26.290
They be crashing into their height.

810
00:49:26.390 --> 00:49:30.620
<v 6>Sam's that they're supposed to pick up the ones they crashed the eye to move</v>

811
00:49:30.621 --> 00:49:31.320
around

812
00:49:31.320 --> 00:49:33.840
<v 5>the large items which returned the most points.</v>

813
00:49:34.060 --> 00:49:35.490
That's the first thing that we started to boring.

814
00:49:35.930 --> 00:49:39.530
<v 6>We'd the orange defending its space and are running out.
If I look at it.
Deal.</v>

815
00:49:39.590 --> 00:49:40.050
Yeah.

816
00:49:40.050 --> 00:49:44.220
<v 5>No,
never had this brand because a,
it's not like one particular thing went wrong.</v>

817
00:49:44.221 --> 00:49:45.810
Basically the thing stopped working.

818
00:49:46.020 --> 00:49:49.680
<v 6>Did teams,
it's given some challenges.
I address all of that,
my code.</v>

819
00:49:49.681 --> 00:49:53.510
So I'm not sure what happened to you.
We get the final score,

820
00:49:53.570 --> 00:49:56.240
Lou one 81 and orange.

821
00:50:03.930 --> 00:50:06.930
The greatest part was working with different teams from around the world.

822
00:50:07.230 --> 00:50:11.880
I'm from Mexico.
Sound no,
you know,
sister represent and the western of mine

823
00:50:14.160 --> 00:50:15.930
you got through language barriers,

824
00:50:15.931 --> 00:50:19.800
you got your cultural barriers and you work together to get here.

825
00:50:19.801 --> 00:50:22.350
And that is such an amazing accomplishment.

826
00:50:22.351 --> 00:50:26.960
And such an example for our world institute global can you did for 40 years or

827
00:50:30.170 --> 00:50:32.120
<v 1>these are the kids that are going to rock the future.</v>

828
00:50:42.970 --> 00:50:44.090
<v 2>All right.
So,
uh,</v>

829
00:50:44.190 --> 00:50:47.280
that's zero robotics operating twice a year in the summer with middle school

830
00:50:47.281 --> 00:50:50.760
students and uh,
in the fall where time with the high school students.

831
00:50:51.000 --> 00:50:55.320
Really great program.
Um,
check it out.
Uh,
these are our links,

832
00:50:55.560 --> 00:50:59.880
more information about spheres and he can be found here.
Um,
and uh,

833
00:50:59.940 --> 00:51:01.290
I'm open to questions.

834
00:51:04.950 --> 00:51:08.990
<v 1>[inaudible]</v>

835
00:51:10.560 --> 00:51:15.370
<v 8>um,
had a question about the propulsion system.
So spheres had CO2 propulsion.</v>

836
00:51:15.740 --> 00:51:20.740
Astra B has a compressed well slightly compressed air propulsion propellers.

837
00:51:21.100 --> 00:51:24.130
Um,
and,
uh,
obviously,
uh,

838
00:51:24.160 --> 00:51:28.180
astro be can't be used outside in the space environment where spheres,
Ken,

839
00:51:28.420 --> 00:51:29.680
which gives it some interesting things.

840
00:51:29.681 --> 00:51:33.670
Now Mars is an environment which sort of is a compromise between them,
right?

841
00:51:33.671 --> 00:51:36.880
It's low g and it's very low atmospheric pressure.

842
00:51:37.180 --> 00:51:39.010
Has there been any thinking about,
uh,

843
00:51:39.130 --> 00:51:43.750
the applicability of an astro be like platform or spheres on Mars,

844
00:51:43.960 --> 00:51:48.530
Mars 2020,
I understand there's going to have a drone get deployed.
Um,

845
00:51:49.150 --> 00:51:52.260
it'd be even more cold to deploy it.
Uh,
spheres or,

846
00:51:52.261 --> 00:51:54.010
or an attribute type of platform.

847
00:51:54.110 --> 00:51:57.800
<v 2>Absolutely.
Quick corrections fears can actually operate outside,</v>

848
00:51:57.801 --> 00:52:00.260
but you're right,
the,
uh,
compress HIA to,
uh,

849
00:52:00.300 --> 00:52:05.300
it gives you that thrust or like a behavior that's and very similar to what you

850
00:52:05.511 --> 00:52:09.050
would see in a set dedicated satellite,
right.
That would,
that could operate eva,

851
00:52:09.320 --> 00:52:12.560
but spheres as they are don't actually operate outside.
Um,

852
00:52:12.590 --> 00:52:14.890
and they'd actually have some issues operating outside.

853
00:52:15.380 --> 00:52:19.610
<v 8>Once it was that clip with it,
uh,
in the Open Bay door of,</v>

854
00:52:19.640 --> 00:52:23.740
of the Atlantis was,
was that outs,

855
00:52:23.850 --> 00:52:27.380
<v 2>that was Eric [inaudible].
That was a project out of JC where,
uh,</v>

856
00:52:27.480 --> 00:52:31.380
they did operate a very similar type of free flour outside of the space shuttle

857
00:52:31.381 --> 00:52:35.850
in,
in 97.
Um,
so different project,
but certainly a,
a similar approach.

858
00:52:35.851 --> 00:52:39.720
I think they used a,
uh,
a different type of code,
gaffer proportion,

859
00:52:40.110 --> 00:52:42.990
but that wasn't quite spheres.
Uh,
but you're right with the blower,

860
00:52:43.110 --> 00:52:48.090
it's very much limited to Iva type,
uh,
uh,
motion.
And um,

861
00:52:48.450 --> 00:52:51.570
and so with these iva type free flyers allowed,

862
00:52:51.571 --> 00:52:54.060
the future work as far as her box is concerned,

863
00:52:54.180 --> 00:52:57.690
is looking at continued iva type behavior.

864
00:52:57.691 --> 00:53:02.140
So whether that's I assess a deep space gateway or other deep,

865
00:53:02.580 --> 00:53:06.660
deep space spacecraft where we need these kinds of robots to enhance what we can

866
00:53:06.661 --> 00:53:10.440
do inside of spacecraft and maintain the space craft for long duration space

867
00:53:10.441 --> 00:53:12.600
travel.
Um,
and that said,

868
00:53:12.601 --> 00:53:16.450
there are some technologies that can be advanced here that the benefit,
uh,

869
00:53:16.470 --> 00:53:20.210
eva type free flowers.
So the navigation,
the,
um,

870
00:53:20.520 --> 00:53:24.910
uh,
the algorithms,
the vision based navigation,
uh,

871
00:53:24.960 --> 00:53:28.840
or just some of the technologies that do have some transfer,
uh,
into,
uh,

872
00:53:28.850 --> 00:53:30.960
other areas that could part Uva.

873
00:53:31.170 --> 00:53:34.320
And then even these types of drones that could operate on Mars.
Uh,

874
00:53:34.321 --> 00:53:39.321
some of the technology that some of these lenders use to narrow and find where

875
00:53:39.751 --> 00:53:43.420
they're going to land on,
on,
on Mars or another planet,
um,

876
00:53:43.810 --> 00:53:48.600
are have some very similar algorithms to operate inside of,
uh,
Astrobotic,
uh,

877
00:53:48.630 --> 00:53:52.020
doing a lot of these advanced common filter tap awkward and second dd sensor

878
00:53:52.021 --> 00:53:56.940
fusions and very quickly,
very rapidly fuse together.
I'm used vision,

879
00:53:57.150 --> 00:54:01.680
uh,
uh,
satellite information,
any information it can,
uh,
to uh,

880
00:54:01.800 --> 00:54:05.520
get accurate and better results.
As far as navigation goes,

881
00:54:06.940 --> 00:54:08.000
<v 9>you said that,
uh,</v>

882
00:54:08.580 --> 00:54:13.580
all these beers are supposed to be operating in either autonomous mode or RC

883
00:54:14.180 --> 00:54:16.730
Moore.
So how autonomous is dark is more like,

884
00:54:16.910 --> 00:54:20.480
do you specify just point a to point B and then it goes from point a to point B

885
00:54:21.040 --> 00:54:24.410
hardware to give the route from 40 to go from point a to point B?

886
00:54:24.780 --> 00:54:25.770
<v 2>Depends on the researcher.</v>

887
00:54:25.771 --> 00:54:28.740
It depends on what you're trying to do on space station.

888
00:54:28.741 --> 00:54:33.580
So spheres has had all kinds of algorithms tested out where they have been our c

889
00:54:33.581 --> 00:54:35.640
controlled by crew,
by ground controllers,

890
00:54:35.850 --> 00:54:39.720
but they've also had algorithms on there that does intelligent path planning.

891
00:54:39.930 --> 00:54:43.380
Right.
How do you,
how do you,
uh,
in real time,
uh,

892
00:54:43.470 --> 00:54:47.670
learn what kind of obstacles are in front of you and plan out what your

893
00:54:47.671 --> 00:54:50.290
trajectory and your,
what your path is going to be.
A,

894
00:54:50.300 --> 00:54:54.060
there's this one really cool video of spheres and operation.
Uh,
it's on youtube.

895
00:54:54.061 --> 00:54:58.710
You can check this out where you have two spheres orbiting each other.
Um,
uh,

896
00:54:58.711 --> 00:55:03.280
and in a perfect,
um,
uh,
uh,
formation right there.

897
00:55:03.281 --> 00:55:05.370
They're across from each other.
And then you have this third,

898
00:55:05.760 --> 00:55:08.940
third spheres unit looking like he wants to jump in on,
on the hopscotch,
right?

899
00:55:09.180 --> 00:55:09.841
And then,
uh,

900
00:55:09.841 --> 00:55:13.290
and then it jumps in and then now you have three spheres in orbit around each

901
00:55:13.291 --> 00:55:15.300
other,
perfectly equal distance from each other.

902
00:55:15.301 --> 00:55:20.301
And that's showing how you can do real time planning of your trajectory and

903
00:55:20.791 --> 00:55:25.770
motion,
uh,
using completely automated Builtin,
um,
algorithms,

904
00:55:25.910 --> 00:55:28.780
uh,
without any control from the outside.
So,
uh,

905
00:55:28.781 --> 00:55:30.960
advancing some of the algorithms needed to do that.

906
00:55:31.110 --> 00:55:33.510
And then even more intelligent type,
uh,

907
00:55:33.511 --> 00:55:37.920
automation algorithms that try to do a lab diagnostics,
a lot of,
um,

908
00:55:38.400 --> 00:55:41.490
identifying the environment,
giving crew,
uh,

909
00:55:41.940 --> 00:55:43.470
advanced warning on different things.

910
00:55:44.070 --> 00:55:48.730
Just trying to be a good citizen as far as,
uh,
being a,

911
00:55:48.731 --> 00:55:51.960
a little robot on,
on space station.
So,
and then giving,

912
00:55:52.260 --> 00:55:54.840
giving a face to a smart environment.

913
00:55:54.841 --> 00:55:58.860
That's another big area of research is trying to generate these smart habitats

914
00:55:59.070 --> 00:56:03.960
where,
uh,
you're trying to get a lot of information from not just,
uh,
the,
uh,

915
00:56:03.961 --> 00:56:05.400
environment and built in sensors,

916
00:56:05.401 --> 00:56:10.320
but also sensors on this free flour and then interact with crew,
right?
So,
uh,

917
00:56:10.530 --> 00:56:13.920
you can generate an environment that's very intelligent and I can do a lot of

918
00:56:13.921 --> 00:56:16.170
things without a hands on maintenance.

919
00:56:17.010 --> 00:56:20.370
<v 9>Oh,
the propulsion of us.
Here's this compressed you to,
uh,</v>

920
00:56:20.470 --> 00:56:24.130
does ISS has the ability to co create

921
00:56:24.130 --> 00:56:28.330
<v 10>and compress and recharge or does it have to those kinds of sites or do they</v>

922
00:56:28.331 --> 00:56:29.290
have to come up from the ground?

923
00:56:29.800 --> 00:56:30.430
<v 2>Uh,</v>

924
00:56:30.430 --> 00:56:35.430
so the ability to recycle CO2 and to a way that's then compress and reuse the

925
00:56:35.501 --> 00:56:36.700
boys.
Actually an area of research.

926
00:56:36.701 --> 00:56:39.280
I know there are researchers looking at doing exactly that.

927
00:56:39.430 --> 00:56:42.250
It's not a routine thing,
at least not yet on,
on space station.

928
00:56:42.490 --> 00:56:47.050
I'm not something spheres utilizes a with spheres.
Uh,
over the last 10 years,

929
00:56:47.060 --> 00:56:50.860
my team's gotten pretty good at a refilling the Sio two tanks.
As it turns out,

930
00:56:50.920 --> 00:56:55.780
there's a certain set of tanks we use,
uh,
that are,
uh,
safety rated and then,
uh,

931
00:56:55.840 --> 00:56:59.500
they get brought back from space station refilled here at our facility.

932
00:56:59.680 --> 00:57:00.490
And we relaunch,
I'm,

933
00:57:00.490 --> 00:57:04.130
every time I talk to a consumable resource that gets you stop,

934
00:57:04.131 --> 00:57:08.200
we'll go through maybe two or three tanks during a test session.
Um,

935
00:57:08.920 --> 00:57:13.360
and,
uh,
so it's a consumable,
uh,
and uh,
the [inaudible] to expel as it turns out,

936
00:57:13.380 --> 00:57:16.100
uh,
isn't a too harmful to,
to crew,
hey,
it's,

937
00:57:16.101 --> 00:57:19.060
it's well within limits of what can get scrubbed out of the environment.

938
00:57:19.240 --> 00:57:23.730
So it turned out to be a really great that proportion for spheres.
And,
uh,

939
00:57:23.770 --> 00:57:24.161
but yeah,

940
00:57:24.161 --> 00:57:28.420
I have heard there are other researchers looking at recycling and pulling the

941
00:57:28.440 --> 00:57:33.300
CO2 from the environment back into a way that's then we usable.
Um,

942
00:57:33.700 --> 00:57:37.810
certainly in situ resource utilization is a very big area that we're going to

943
00:57:37.811 --> 00:57:42.520
need to make advances in.
I had to go to Mars and other deep space destination

944
00:57:44.480 --> 00:57:46.930
<v 10>[inaudible].</v>
