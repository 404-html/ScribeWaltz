1
00:00:03.710 --> 00:00:04.543
Yeah.

2
00:00:10.060 --> 00:00:15.060
<v 0>Thank you for inviting me to talk to Google and a stay and as mentioned by</v>

3
00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:22.320
probiotic that I have been working for almost a decade now in this domain of

4
00:00:22.871 --> 00:00:27.871
spreading cyber safety of Ns against cyber crimes.

5
00:00:28.390 --> 00:00:33.390
I have spoken to say 2 million students in the country now and since 2008 I've

6
00:00:34.901 --> 00:00:39.901
been doing it and my experiences that I personally receive 30 to 40 complaints

7
00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:46.260
from these young kids every day when it comes to the online threats to children

8
00:00:46.930 --> 00:00:48.730
and the age group,

9
00:00:48.731 --> 00:00:53.560
like it starts with eight years and it goes up to 2122 school and college

10
00:00:53.561 --> 00:00:56.250
students.
So I talked to school and college both.

11
00:00:56.650 --> 00:00:59.170
The second role which I do is I trained law enforcement,

12
00:00:59.171 --> 00:01:04.171
which I've been doing very actively since 2009 and right from top of the country

13
00:01:04.610 --> 00:01:05.560
moved to south.

14
00:01:05.561 --> 00:01:08.560
I've been traveling to various academies and empowering the law enforcement

15
00:01:08.561 --> 00:01:09.394
officers.

16
00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:15.370
First thing was the challenge to make them understand that cyber crime is not a

17
00:01:15.371 --> 00:01:19.330
monster.
So Eh.
And the second was,

18
00:01:19.331 --> 00:01:23.560
if you look at our NCRB status takes in India,
yes it is increasing.

19
00:01:23.561 --> 00:01:28.540
The complaints are increasing many terms to frauds and uh,
uh,

20
00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:32.020
any abuse on social media specifically to children?

21
00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:36.220
I think there's something missing.
What is missing,
which I started promoting,

22
00:01:36.221 --> 00:01:40.360
it's called netiquettes cyber hygiene,
digital wellness.

23
00:01:40.750 --> 00:01:44.230
And I think it should become a part of the curriculum today.
Now why?

24
00:01:44.470 --> 00:01:46.840
Because cyberbullying is on a rise.

25
00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:50.740
That is another major challenge for every school and college.

26
00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:52.600
Even any social media,

27
00:01:52.601 --> 00:01:57.070
you pick up a messenger or you pick up a social media platform,

28
00:01:57.880 --> 00:01:59.290
posting obscene content,

29
00:02:00.940 --> 00:02:05.920
making more off pictures,
spreading rumors,
writing bad words.

30
00:02:06.010 --> 00:02:07.030
It's a very common thing.

31
00:02:07.510 --> 00:02:12.310
And the major thing which I see across is that they don't even know what are the

32
00:02:12.311 --> 00:02:13.980
cyber laws.
So very famous line,

33
00:02:13.981 --> 00:02:17.860
which I always say when I talk to children and it's always carrying with me,

34
00:02:17.861 --> 00:02:22.140
that is virtual world is not a game.
It's your life.
So I,

35
00:02:22.141 --> 00:02:26.140
I talk to children about cyber laws
for them,

36
00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:29.530
creating a fake account is fun for them.

37
00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:33.130
Hacking into an account to fund a sixth grader.
He stands up and says,

38
00:02:33.131 --> 00:02:35.710
I'm a hacker.
And I asked him,
what do you do?

39
00:02:35.711 --> 00:02:38.680
Ballet I have Wifi is when a why my mother doesn't give me Wifi.

40
00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:41.920
So I had called my neighbors by five and how do you do it?

41
00:02:41.921 --> 00:02:45.720
But I just got an application which is available.
I saw video,

42
00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:47.470
I learned it and now I can hack by five.

43
00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:52.890
So now this is a challenge making them understand that hacking is a crime.

44
00:02:52.901 --> 00:02:53.734
Full Stop.

45
00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:57.850
There is a simple section in one of the cyber laws information technology act,

46
00:02:57.851 --> 00:03:02.851
which I call section 60 c which says that if fraudulently or dishonestly used in

47
00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:06.970
somebody's password,
unique identity or electronic signature,

48
00:03:06.971 --> 00:03:09.640
you are punishable for three years with the final one,
lack rupee.

49
00:03:09.910 --> 00:03:13.690
And then I talk to children are very popular.
They say that only three years,

50
00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:19.240
food and lodging is free.
So the message is very clear.
Hey listen,

51
00:03:19.241 --> 00:03:20.710
hacking is a crime.

52
00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:24.010
Same comes when we talk about the incidences of cyberbullying.

53
00:03:24.490 --> 00:03:29.200
So just I came in the morning flight and I got a message from a young girl.

54
00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:34.210
Somebody created a fake account and sharing and posting my personal content.

55
00:03:34.990 --> 00:03:37.180
Now,
and this is a cyber crime in my country.

56
00:03:37.570 --> 00:03:40.380
So there's a posting obscene content,

57
00:03:40.450 --> 00:03:42.640
private content online I and the first line,

58
00:03:42.641 --> 00:03:46.510
which is very popular line with every victim who's calling me,

59
00:03:46.730 --> 00:03:49.480
don't tell it to my parents will kill me.

60
00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:54.280
So this gap,
the digital divide.
When I talk to parents,

61
00:03:54.281 --> 00:03:57.790
I do a lot of parents sessions.
Now why?
Because only because of this reason.

62
00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:00.190
There's a big digital divide.
The parent will come and say,

63
00:04:00.191 --> 00:04:02.200
I don't know what my tranquil do on iPhone.

64
00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:04.270
He's such a brilliant boy or something like that.

65
00:04:04.570 --> 00:04:07.650
But when it comes to you pay the children's,

66
00:04:07.651 --> 00:04:11.890
say that we are teaching parents how to use technology,
it's good.

67
00:04:12.460 --> 00:04:15.220
But are we teaching children netiquettes and cyber hygiene?

68
00:04:15.520 --> 00:04:19.720
This is my point and that's how I cover up when I talk to them.
Law Enforcement.

69
00:04:19.750 --> 00:04:23.500
The biggest challenge here in law enforcement today is that cybercrime is a

70
00:04:23.501 --> 00:04:28.390
monster.
And when I talked to them,
I say it's not a monster,
the same crime.

71
00:04:28.590 --> 00:04:33.590
But previously they used to come and rob my house or my bank locker.

72
00:04:33.730 --> 00:04:37.840
Today they are doing it online.
Same.
I used to tease a girl.

73
00:04:37.870 --> 00:04:39.130
There was FTZ today.

74
00:04:39.131 --> 00:04:43.580
They do it online by creating some impersonating account or by posting some bad

75
00:04:43.581 --> 00:04:44.470
pictures of words.

76
00:04:45.310 --> 00:04:48.910
The only thing which they need to understand today here is that how do you

77
00:04:48.911 --> 00:04:52.390
correlate all these service providers and how do you interact with them to

78
00:04:53.290 --> 00:04:54.580
protect the law,

79
00:04:54.950 --> 00:04:59.410
to punish them as per the information technology act,

80
00:04:59.411 --> 00:05:02.770
which says that spreading any obscene content is a crime.

81
00:05:03.670 --> 00:05:07.330
So they have a wonderful section here and it at call section 67 which says that

82
00:05:07.331 --> 00:05:12.331
if you publish transplant or even become a reason to publish any obscene content

83
00:05:14.230 --> 00:05:15.190
electronically,

84
00:05:15.340 --> 00:05:19.540
you're punished for three years with a fine of five lakh rupees people at times

85
00:05:19.541 --> 00:05:24.090
and fun.
They create messages on messengers,
different messengers,
chat messengers,

86
00:05:24.100 --> 00:05:28.720
and the starts sending obscene content.
You are breaking the law.

87
00:05:29.680 --> 00:05:34.680
Similarly comes with sexually explicit content section 67 67 eight it says that

88
00:05:35.650 --> 00:05:38.500
any sexually explicit content,
if you're sharing electronically,

89
00:05:38.530 --> 00:05:41.280
you're punishable for five years with a fine of 10 lakhs.

90
00:05:41.330 --> 00:05:43.990
Non Billable people don't know these law

91
00:05:45.550 --> 00:05:48.220
and a very common problem we should come across with young kids.

92
00:05:48.550 --> 00:05:53.200
So I was in a relationship.
Okay.
I had a breakup.
Okay,

93
00:05:53.500 --> 00:05:56.200
now this person is blackmailing me with my personal pictures.

94
00:05:57.350 --> 00:06:00.950
16 is becoming a serious problem.
It's a psychological problem.

95
00:06:01.630 --> 00:06:02.630
You young children,

96
00:06:02.631 --> 00:06:07.631
they tend to share personal images and they think they think I'm sharing it on a

97
00:06:08.451 --> 00:06:10.880
messenger.
It will be destroyed in three seconds.
I'm sorry.

98
00:06:10.881 --> 00:06:11.930
Nothing gets destroyed.

99
00:06:13.700 --> 00:06:16.850
So how to handle digital footprints is another.

100
00:06:17.480 --> 00:06:20.510
The people who don't understand what a digital footprints and how they can

101
00:06:20.511 --> 00:06:21.890
follow you for a lifetime.

102
00:06:22.400 --> 00:06:27.400
So this is another thing which I interact when I talk to young minds and even

103
00:06:27.681 --> 00:06:30.320
professional role.
So second days,

104
00:06:30.710 --> 00:06:33.110
the challenge of handling such crimes.

105
00:06:33.740 --> 00:06:36.920
Today something happened online and you know what kind of cases are coming when

106
00:06:36.921 --> 00:06:41.870
it comes to bank froze everyday there will new modus operandi coming in to old

107
00:06:41.871 --> 00:06:45.650
one.
I'm getting a call.
I got a call from a person who is calling from the bank.

108
00:06:46.370 --> 00:06:49.640
He says that your bank account will be close because your ad hide is not linked

109
00:06:49.641 --> 00:06:52.580
to your bank account and your account will become zero.

110
00:06:52.670 --> 00:06:56.300
Oh don't close my account.
Then verify your account.
Give me your card details.

111
00:06:56.301 --> 00:06:57.380
I gave my card details,

112
00:06:57.590 --> 00:07:00.050
we are sending a message to verify whether it is you are not.

113
00:07:00.051 --> 00:07:01.910
Please give us that message number.
Also,

114
00:07:02.660 --> 00:07:07.550
he shared his OTP also and now he comes and file a complaint.
90,000 gone.

115
00:07:07.551 --> 00:07:11.690
10 Rupee Balance and a,
we call it a cyber crime.
Second,

116
00:07:12.200 --> 00:07:15.680
the most,
uh,
popular,
which is happening these days is skimming.

117
00:07:16.130 --> 00:07:19.250
So now these hackers,
they have got access to those devices.

118
00:07:19.550 --> 00:07:23.580
They can break a ATM or they can,
uh,

119
00:07:23.660 --> 00:07:28.550
plan to small skimmer to the vendor windows machine where your car get duplicate

120
00:07:28.551 --> 00:07:32.150
it.
Now,
if you look at the internationally,
everywhere,

121
00:07:32.180 --> 00:07:35.210
you don't require a pin or an Otp to swipe a card.

122
00:07:35.300 --> 00:07:38.450
It's only in India that you require a pin in and OTP.

123
00:07:38.750 --> 00:07:40.970
So now the complaining comes to me and say,

124
00:07:40.971 --> 00:07:45.971
is that my cyber cell that I was sleeping in the night and I had a $40,000

125
00:07:46.100 --> 00:07:49.640
transaction on my car from some country in France or us.

126
00:07:50.510 --> 00:07:52.670
The challenge for the law enforcement is that first of all,

127
00:07:52.671 --> 00:07:54.890
they cannot go to us and France and investigate.

128
00:07:55.310 --> 00:07:57.320
The second the money has been swiped.

129
00:07:57.670 --> 00:08:00.540
It's a very popular technique and hackers are doing it in our country.

130
00:08:00.560 --> 00:08:01.490
They call it garden.

131
00:08:02.570 --> 00:08:07.070
So the Stele card information here and sell it for some peanuts to

132
00:08:07.071 --> 00:08:08.060
international,

133
00:08:08.540 --> 00:08:13.130
you can call organized criminals who have those groups somewhere where they just

134
00:08:13.131 --> 00:08:17.270
pay them peanuts and there they use your card.
Same as happening,
reverse.

135
00:08:17.540 --> 00:08:20.600
So there are foreigners whose cards have been cloned and skimmed in India.

136
00:08:21.230 --> 00:08:24.080
This is cybercrime third most popular,

137
00:08:24.081 --> 00:08:27.290
which I am seeing across now when I visit so many police stations and cyber

138
00:08:27.360 --> 00:08:30.890
sellers,
man in the middle attack.
So the compromise,
our emails,

139
00:08:31.190 --> 00:08:32.690
they get into our email settings.

140
00:08:32.720 --> 00:08:35.750
We people hardly look at our settings on a daily basis.

141
00:08:35.990 --> 00:08:40.010
They create filters and forwarders and they create tweet domains.

142
00:08:40.280 --> 00:08:43.640
So my email id for example,
is infrastructure tendon dotcom.

143
00:08:43.850 --> 00:08:45.810
The hacker creates infotrack Shit,
dawn,

144
00:08:45.820 --> 00:08:50.480
dawn.com he just tweaks it from me too and he reads all my meals,

145
00:08:50.600 --> 00:08:51.770
copy,
paste the trail,

146
00:08:52.220 --> 00:08:56.940
take my invoice and send it to my buyer vendor saying that my bank account is

147
00:08:56.941 --> 00:08:58.410
frozen duty,
GST audit.

148
00:08:58.890 --> 00:09:02.160
So please kindly transfer my payment to my back bank London account.

149
00:09:02.161 --> 00:09:06.170
And how much when like 25,000 euros gone,
this tour exporter,

150
00:09:06.180 --> 00:09:10.740
he lost recently one and a half like euros just because of tweaking man in the

151
00:09:10.741 --> 00:09:11.574
middle attack.

152
00:09:11.940 --> 00:09:15.440
These are the organized crimes which we are seeing and they all started with the

153
00:09:15.450 --> 00:09:17.690
email which used to come here,
a lucky winner,
Coca Cola,

154
00:09:17.710 --> 00:09:22.710
$900 million and now it is transformed to this top talking of scams and I'm,

155
00:09:23.680 --> 00:09:26.610
I got a call,
three girls the last two days have called me.

156
00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:31.980
We got to link that somebody is posting some bad pictures on some social media.

157
00:09:32.010 --> 00:09:34.860
I clicked on that link and my account got hacked.

158
00:09:36.030 --> 00:09:39.750
Then all my friends in the network received a message that I'm in trouble.

159
00:09:40.260 --> 00:09:44.130
Please deposit 701,000 or two piece to my so and so wallet.

160
00:09:44.400 --> 00:09:46.350
I will return it to you as soon as possible.

161
00:09:47.490 --> 00:09:50.220
All the respected friends were busy in their daily life and work.

162
00:09:50.221 --> 00:09:54.300
So it is a matter of click on a smart phone to just go to your wallet and

163
00:09:54.301 --> 00:09:55.140
transfer that amount.

164
00:09:55.740 --> 00:10:00.740
And later they realized that her account was compromised and the hacker has

165
00:10:01.770 --> 00:10:06.540
taken complete control.
Fishing,
peep,
Eh,
when I talk to people,

166
00:10:06.541 --> 00:10:10.650
they're not able to understand what is fishing today.
They click on every mail.

167
00:10:10.710 --> 00:10:15.300
One of,
recently I got a case from very big celebrity who's Icloud was hacked.

168
00:10:15.810 --> 00:10:19.230
There's a smartphone cloud and how very simple.

169
00:10:19.360 --> 00:10:23.250
He got a male and was a tweaking in spelling and he,

170
00:10:23.280 --> 00:10:28.140
this lady entered her credentials cloud was hacked and all the personal pictures

171
00:10:28.141 --> 00:10:33.141
were downloaded from a personal cloud and then starts talking in black Millie.

172
00:10:33.840 --> 00:10:36.000
So these are the most popular,

173
00:10:36.280 --> 00:10:40.560
when I say incidences and coming to the solutions,
what we do,

174
00:10:41.370 --> 00:10:45.360
I try to tell them how to use an APP first.
So that is a basic thing.

175
00:10:45.361 --> 00:10:48.330
People are not aware.
So if I'm using an APP,

176
00:10:48.360 --> 00:10:50.910
they have wonderful features inside it,

177
00:10:50.911 --> 00:10:54.030
which can help you to recover your account,
protect your account,

178
00:10:54.031 --> 00:10:57.720
whether it's two step authentication.
The basic knowledge is missing.

179
00:10:58.200 --> 00:11:02.250
And when you go down in the rural area,
everybody has a smart phone.

180
00:11:02.760 --> 00:11:07.080
That day I,
I met a small vendor,
he asked me,
I had no cash.

181
00:11:07.081 --> 00:11:09.780
So he said,
you can give it to me on my wallet.

182
00:11:10.260 --> 00:11:12.180
So many who told you to use a wall?
It,

183
00:11:12.181 --> 00:11:15.690
how do you know where the mobile recharge person?

184
00:11:15.691 --> 00:11:18.090
He put Wallet Inside My,

185
00:11:18.180 --> 00:11:21.990
in Brooklyn Hindy he said he has inserted this volatile assignment.

186
00:11:21.991 --> 00:11:26.790
What is your wallet ID and Password Bully?
What is this?
What is this?

187
00:11:26.791 --> 00:11:31.470
He doesn't even knows that a wallet on a smartphone has an identity and a

188
00:11:31.471 --> 00:11:32.790
password,
which he doesn't know.

189
00:11:33.840 --> 00:11:38.840
So the challenge today we have is a handling this digital revolution.

190
00:11:39.900 --> 00:11:43.440
So I always,
whenever I talk,
I always not only talk about digital India,

191
00:11:43.441 --> 00:11:45.300
but I always talk about safer digital India.

192
00:11:45.750 --> 00:11:49.110
And that is the word I tried to key is whether it's talking to children or

193
00:11:49.111 --> 00:11:52.560
talking to adults and professionals with children.
Yes.
Uh,

194
00:11:52.640 --> 00:11:54.890
we're doing a lot of work on online prediction and why?

195
00:11:54.891 --> 00:11:58.480
Because 16 stalking and then these,
uh,

196
00:11:58.510 --> 00:12:02.560
societal games coming up and suddenly trying to envelop the kids.

197
00:12:02.740 --> 00:12:06.730
And you know what,
kids have curiosity.
They don't want to commit suicide.

198
00:12:07.090 --> 00:12:10.450
I was talking to kids,
I recently,
last couple of weeks,

199
00:12:10.451 --> 00:12:14.350
I've spoken to 25,000 kids in the country.
I was in good drought.
I was in Djenne,

200
00:12:14.710 --> 00:12:19.180
I was in north Delhi and all schools,
they wanted to see what is it exactly,

201
00:12:19.300 --> 00:12:22.790
how does one person commits suicide?
And you know,
the modus operandi,
they,

202
00:12:22.800 --> 00:12:27.400
they just tried to blackmail you and stalk you.
And then they tried to,

203
00:12:27.430 --> 00:12:30.670
and whosoever these societal curators and Admin so called lab.

204
00:12:31.300 --> 00:12:34.980
So there is a need of awareness in our children.
And uh,

205
00:12:35.020 --> 00:12:38.140
they are curious about everything.
Whether,
and I have seen children,

206
00:12:38.290 --> 00:12:41.920
they don't even know how can they secure their applications,
whether,

207
00:12:41.950 --> 00:12:45.760
whether it's a popular video channel or it's a popular search engine.

208
00:12:45.940 --> 00:12:49.930
They don't even know that there are some settings which can prevent them from

209
00:12:49.931 --> 00:12:53.050
harm.
And not only them.
When I talked to the ICT,

210
00:12:53.110 --> 00:12:57.820
there's a big gap I see is very good in teaching the school a ICT syllabus,

211
00:12:58.120 --> 00:13:00.910
right?
The program and put a number and generate the femoral series.

212
00:13:00.930 --> 00:13:04.540
They're excellent in doing that,
but when it comes to hacking and stuff,

213
00:13:04.600 --> 00:13:08.940
you will find the eighth grader talking and dive.
I know how to use Kali Unix.

214
00:13:08.960 --> 00:13:12.730
I can create a Metasploit and all those words you start speaking and that really

215
00:13:12.731 --> 00:13:16.990
scares and then even ask me,
I have confronted these questions from young minds.

216
00:13:17.350 --> 00:13:18.940
What if I'm using a tor browser,

217
00:13:18.941 --> 00:13:23.200
how we'll do crack me and when or which class you are in Bulla seventh standard.

218
00:13:23.560 --> 00:13:26.770
When you come to me separately,
I will tell you how to trace a tor browser.

219
00:13:27.220 --> 00:13:28.000
So these,

220
00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:32.650
you know what the explosion is there when it comes to information or,

221
00:13:33.310 --> 00:13:35.410
but the mindset is not ready for it.

222
00:13:36.190 --> 00:13:39.280
So to prepare that mindset is also very important.

223
00:13:39.820 --> 00:13:43.240
Whether it's your gaming habits or it's your social media habits.

224
00:13:43.990 --> 00:13:47.080
Law of crimes have been reported because people,

225
00:13:47.081 --> 00:13:49.480
they don't even know what are the privacy features.

226
00:13:49.481 --> 00:13:54.481
I remember when case in it was five years back to now we have that security by

227
00:13:55.420 --> 00:13:58.990
by the government of India that even if I change the Sim card,

228
00:13:59.140 --> 00:14:03.400
my SMS service will not work for a limited time.
You know what used to happen,

229
00:14:03.520 --> 00:14:04.480
identity theft,

230
00:14:05.110 --> 00:14:10.110
how the hacker will get access to your date of birth from social media side,

231
00:14:10.690 --> 00:14:14.410
get access to your personal information like people love to post today on any

232
00:14:14.411 --> 00:14:15.340
popular social media.

233
00:14:15.341 --> 00:14:17.590
There are so many international days we are celebrating today.

234
00:14:18.010 --> 00:14:20.230
Happy Mother's Day.
I love my mom come lot baby.

235
00:14:20.950 --> 00:14:25.880
So my mom name is available on the site and that is a secret question and answer

236
00:14:25.881 --> 00:14:29.110
to one of my online banking detail.

237
00:14:30.250 --> 00:14:35.230
The hacker very conveniently Vanc and he issued a Sim card of that with him.

238
00:14:35.800 --> 00:14:37.510
The moment he got access to the same car,

239
00:14:37.520 --> 00:14:41.680
he got access to the mobile banking network and he immediately swiped all the

240
00:14:41.681 --> 00:14:42.514
money out.

241
00:14:43.930 --> 00:14:48.340
This all money was taken out with the help of and this gentleman,

242
00:14:48.370 --> 00:14:51.100
he was sitting in his office and he taught my network is not coming.

243
00:14:51.710 --> 00:14:56.600
The message on the phone was sim unregistered.
He tried to plug out the same,

244
00:14:56.601 --> 00:15:01.100
put it back,
nothing happened after some hours he went to the mobile.

245
00:15:01.101 --> 00:15:04.790
You can't be in the set.
Listen,
your same goddess corrupted.
Take a new one,

246
00:15:05.330 --> 00:15:07.910
you've got a new Sim card.
And after five hours of activation,

247
00:15:07.911 --> 00:15:10.880
he realized that all the bank is empty.

248
00:15:11.570 --> 00:15:15.140
When we started getting such cases of identity tab debtors when an action was

249
00:15:15.141 --> 00:15:15.501
taken.

250
00:15:15.501 --> 00:15:20.501
And now today we are preventing Your Sim misuse by locking your SMSs for a

251
00:15:20.781 --> 00:15:24.620
period of time.
But hackers are very smart.
You create one rule,

252
00:15:24.621 --> 00:15:26.810
they know how to break the other one.

253
00:15:27.230 --> 00:15:29.860
So looking at the old case studies,

254
00:15:29.870 --> 00:15:34.630
it is very important to promote education awareness.
Uh,

255
00:15:34.740 --> 00:15:39.740
there is a very popular app where you can synchronize the APP on your computer.

256
00:15:41.330 --> 00:15:45.530
So that's the messenger app where you just particularly scan a QR code.

257
00:15:45.800 --> 00:15:46.940
When I talk to people,

258
00:15:47.730 --> 00:15:48.380
<v 2>yeah,</v>

259
00:15:48.380 --> 00:15:51.170
<v 0>70% are not aware of that option.</v>

260
00:15:52.280 --> 00:15:55.670
And I am receiving complaints where a person come and see.

261
00:15:56.090 --> 00:15:59.180
So I have this personal messenger APP on my mobile.
You can,

262
00:15:59.181 --> 00:16:02.450
anybody else wants to use it?
And I go,
yes.

263
00:16:03.170 --> 00:16:06.920
Well if somebody's phone is hacked because I have north center mass message to

264
00:16:06.921 --> 00:16:07.830
anybody,
but some,

265
00:16:07.850 --> 00:16:11.060
all our complaining that you are sending some bag bag messages and I have not

266
00:16:11.061 --> 00:16:13.460
sent it and it is going from my messenger.

267
00:16:14.790 --> 00:16:19.110
When I checked his phone,
his phone was already sinked into another device.

268
00:16:19.620 --> 00:16:23.460
And that device was somebody else who was using that application.

269
00:16:24.180 --> 00:16:26.080
So this is a challenge,
uh,

270
00:16:26.100 --> 00:16:30.720
when it comes to and at the ground level.
Yes,
people are not aware.

271
00:16:31.680 --> 00:16:33.750
You have to play a very proactive role today.

272
00:16:33.960 --> 00:16:38.960
And the best way is toxic start impacting this education to the young minds and,

273
00:16:39.751 --> 00:16:40.110
uh,

274
00:16:40.110 --> 00:16:44.550
at the root level because they also need this training on bullying and stalking.

275
00:16:44.970 --> 00:16:48.300
And,
uh,
well,
I,
I keep up children,
especially,

276
00:16:48.720 --> 00:16:52.590
I got a case where a person created a fake email account impersonating account

277
00:16:52.591 --> 00:16:55.380
and send a very different married to another child.
You know,
what happened?

278
00:16:55.381 --> 00:16:59.160
That child was into depression for two,
three days.
And you know,

279
00:16:59.161 --> 00:17:02.310
what is the age of that child live in years,
11 years

280
00:17:04.360 --> 00:17:06.160
for 10 kids.
It's a prank.

281
00:17:06.940 --> 00:17:11.940
And I'm sorry for me as for the Itx Itsa offense because it exists,

282
00:17:13.280 --> 00:17:18.280
but nation is a crime section 66 d clicking personal pictures and sharing is a

283
00:17:18.731 --> 00:17:22.510
crime.
So we have special uh,
act,
uh,

284
00:17:22.540 --> 00:17:27.540
section in the it act with say section 66 he captured in publishing and

285
00:17:28.961 --> 00:17:33.961
transmitting image of a private area of any person without his or her consent.

286
00:17:35.800 --> 00:17:39.610
Three years of punishment,
two lakh rupees,
fine or both.

287
00:17:41.940 --> 00:17:46.410
And sexting.
Oh my God.
Approximately five years back,

288
00:17:46.411 --> 00:17:50.010
I used to get one or two complaints in a month.
I'm sorry.
Today I'm 15 to 20.

289
00:17:50.011 --> 00:17:54.390
The more and more kids go in the country,
the more and more,
uh,
such problems.

290
00:17:54.391 --> 00:17:57.720
I keep on hearing personal pictures going viral.

291
00:17:58.230 --> 00:18:01.410
Social exclusion is there in children.
They have complexes.
You know,

292
00:18:01.411 --> 00:18:05.640
what are the complexes?
Body shame.
But shame is becoming alon blacks.

293
00:18:05.641 --> 00:18:09.690
This young girl I did not got likes on my picture on the social media.

294
00:18:09.691 --> 00:18:13.650
So I'm having depression.
Yes,
they have depression now.

295
00:18:14.220 --> 00:18:16.650
So to talk to them in this.
And,

296
00:18:16.651 --> 00:18:20.820
and I have realized that there is a big gap now children and especially the

297
00:18:20.821 --> 00:18:25.700
young ones there.
So getting addicted to,
I'm using the word addiction now,
Eh,

298
00:18:26.100 --> 00:18:30.330
I teach the positive use.
I,
one of my,
uh,
my own family,

299
00:18:30.331 --> 00:18:31.840
there was an issue where this,

300
00:18:32.490 --> 00:18:36.600
he was having a dead addiction to playing these Voiland games and there was a

301
00:18:36.601 --> 00:18:40.740
lot of transformation in his behavior.
So he was getting violent at home,

302
00:18:40.741 --> 00:18:43.980
aggressive.
He used to throw things and break things.

303
00:18:44.340 --> 00:18:47.220
And I asked a simple question,
which game does he play?
Ball,

304
00:18:47.270 --> 00:18:49.830
he plays this wall in game.
How much?
Three to four hours a day,

305
00:18:50.790 --> 00:18:52.950
three to four hours a day.

306
00:18:53.160 --> 00:18:56.280
And you will understand today that in child psychology,

307
00:18:56.281 --> 00:18:59.640
whatever you see you in you,
it's like a simple osmosis going on.

308
00:18:59.970 --> 00:19:02.010
So if I'm playing while in games for the whole day,

309
00:19:02.011 --> 00:19:05.550
I'm imbibing while an aggression in my nature.

310
00:19:06.460 --> 00:19:08.070
So I shifted him and I said,
okay,

311
00:19:08.071 --> 00:19:12.120
you create this wonderful channel on a social media site and you start playing

312
00:19:12.121 --> 00:19:16.380
your keyboard and your guitar and then see you will start monetizing it and you

313
00:19:16.381 --> 00:19:17.191
can earn money.

314
00:19:17.191 --> 00:19:21.990
And it really worked as a magic and he's now out of his addiction.

315
00:19:21.991 --> 00:19:26.010
And today he's more concerned about his channel and he's creating new content,

316
00:19:26.011 --> 00:19:28.290
sharing,
liking us comments.

317
00:19:28.290 --> 00:19:32.130
And everyday he's respecting all the comments and then he's responding to them.

318
00:19:32.670 --> 00:19:34.320
And I could,
I could easily grab,

319
00:19:34.321 --> 00:19:37.950
brought him out from the negative part of the addiction to a positive side of

320
00:19:37.951 --> 00:19:39.930
the neck.
So this is another thing.

321
00:19:39.931 --> 00:19:43.800
And I started one wonderful activity after addressing more than 25,000 schools

322
00:19:43.801 --> 00:19:47.910
in the country,
uh,
and colleges,
I started creating salts,
my sites,

323
00:19:47.930 --> 00:19:51.180
many cyber cells in the school.
I,
you give the name Cyber Congress.

324
00:19:51.570 --> 00:19:56.430
So I do this kind of an effort where I trained them for eight hours to 10 hours,

325
00:19:56.550 --> 00:19:59.610
a handful of students who are the good and empathy and all.

326
00:19:59.640 --> 00:20:01.470
I called them the cyber captains of the school,

327
00:20:01.890 --> 00:20:06.720
their counselors and their ICT stuff in a closed room and they do two things
now.

328
00:20:06.750 --> 00:20:10.710
They help children with problems.
They know the wrestle park,

329
00:20:10.711 --> 00:20:14.850
they know right from how to talk to the service provider and how to come back

330
00:20:14.910 --> 00:20:17.610
out of her problem.
What is the rehearsal?
Number two,

331
00:20:17.880 --> 00:20:22.170
they inculcate positive Internet habits in the country,
so that is another,

332
00:20:22.230 --> 00:20:24.990
I've seen a wonderful change when if you,

333
00:20:25.160 --> 00:20:28.710
because he children don't know what to do on Internet because the Internet was

334
00:20:28.711 --> 00:20:32.100
never a subject in a country for them.
Social media is Internet,

335
00:20:33.570 --> 00:20:35.760
so they never got trained.
Yes,

336
00:20:35.761 --> 00:20:40.710
they've got trained in C and C plus plus and website development and PHP and

337
00:20:40.711 --> 00:20:45.240
html.
That was a part of the syllabus but not a single class has ever taught you.

338
00:20:45.390 --> 00:20:49.420
Even I talk to children,
they don't even know the full form of gprs.
Very Fun,

339
00:20:49.480 --> 00:20:53.260
fun and funny.
And then I have to tell the managers,
good rod partner at TCM law,

340
00:20:53.560 --> 00:20:56.740
so we'll no,
no,
no,
no.
Monica note is global something many?
No,
no,
no.

341
00:20:56.890 --> 00:20:59.350
It is general packet radio service.
The same thing,

342
00:20:59.351 --> 00:21:01.930
which you are using 24 hours on your smartphone.

343
00:21:02.890 --> 00:21:04.750
So to create that positive impact,

344
00:21:04.751 --> 00:21:07.930
I started inculcating this cyber congress thing and that has been very

345
00:21:07.931 --> 00:21:10.390
successful and you know what I do also,

346
00:21:10.391 --> 00:21:14.350
I give surveys to them every three months,

347
00:21:14.410 --> 00:21:15.430
a small survey,

348
00:21:15.520 --> 00:21:19.480
internal survey with all the kids to tell about their online habits and their

349
00:21:19.481 --> 00:21:22.180
issues.
And after the Cyber Congress implementation,

350
00:21:22.181 --> 00:21:25.510
the problems which are reported on the first day of say 60% children having

351
00:21:25.511 --> 00:21:26.920
problems of bullying,

352
00:21:26.921 --> 00:21:31.921
stalking or defamation or something is coming down to 25 and 15% after every

353
00:21:32.801 --> 00:21:34.990
three months,
the issue is falling.

354
00:21:35.080 --> 00:21:37.780
So if I know how to be responsible online from the day one,

355
00:21:37.781 --> 00:21:41.500
because then I think when you go become a senior also,
you know what?

356
00:21:41.501 --> 00:21:44.710
Our digital footprints,
no you will.
Nobody will mess up.

357
00:21:45.310 --> 00:21:48.040
And the basic things like don't share your passwords.

358
00:21:48.580 --> 00:21:51.850
They don't share your credit card numbers with anybody.

359
00:21:52.030 --> 00:21:55.870
Don't give your card to the vendor.
People give their car.
I asked them,

360
00:21:55.871 --> 00:21:58.090
do you give you a wallet to the person?
Okay,

361
00:21:58.091 --> 00:22:01.510
take my wallet and get me some 10 rupees stuff from the market.

362
00:22:01.511 --> 00:22:03.040
Take my wallet and go,
no,

363
00:22:03.070 --> 00:22:06.310
you don't give your wallet it then how can you give your evil it to anybody?

364
00:22:07.360 --> 00:22:09.980
This debit card or credit card is called the Ebola.

365
00:22:10.450 --> 00:22:13.600
Now you give you a wallet and then you come and complain that my card is in my

366
00:22:13.601 --> 00:22:16.450
pocket and somebody has to draw money from Delhi ATM.

367
00:22:17.260 --> 00:22:21.740
Your car got cloned.
So there are these uh,

368
00:22:22.240 --> 00:22:26.320
organized criminals who are misusing all these techniques,

369
00:22:26.321 --> 00:22:29.530
which people so to how to prevent this.
So number one,

370
00:22:29.680 --> 00:22:32.770
you're not giving your car to anybody.
I also teach people to know,

371
00:22:32.800 --> 00:22:35.890
remove the CVV number from the backside of your card.

372
00:22:36.220 --> 00:22:38.590
Take a black marker and erase it and keep it safe.

373
00:22:38.590 --> 00:22:41.410
Because if I come to know your card number and CVV,

374
00:22:41.770 --> 00:22:45.160
I don't need any other authentication online to go to any market place and do

375
00:22:45.161 --> 00:22:49.540
shopping.
And that is what is happening.
So preventing that.

376
00:22:49.541 --> 00:22:52.210
So these simple do's and don'ts have,

377
00:22:52.330 --> 00:22:57.160
we are trying to create to spread the Savannah's and the challenges.

378
00:22:57.190 --> 00:23:01.120
Yes,
there are challenges because if you look at the policing in India,

379
00:23:01.840 --> 00:23:04.650
so we pull the thing,
it was the actual work.

380
00:23:04.660 --> 00:23:08.980
The maximum force of the police is the,
uh,
the constables,

381
00:23:08.981 --> 00:23:12.990
the head constables and the southern specters.
Then the,

382
00:23:13.000 --> 00:23:16.990
its officers and those relations are igs and SSPS.

383
00:23:17.290 --> 00:23:21.250
Actual work is to be done by the maximum.
This force,

384
00:23:21.251 --> 00:23:26.170
which is your constables and all.
So their basic training.
You know what I,

385
00:23:26.230 --> 00:23:30.040
when they,
they think cybercrime training means somebody something specialized.

386
00:23:30.041 --> 00:23:34.180
You have to be a biotech or a or a master in computer science.
Sorry,

387
00:23:34.900 --> 00:23:38.380
I,
I,
whenever I go to and with,
when you want to investigate cyber crime,

388
00:23:38.680 --> 00:23:42.760
you only need to do things.
We'll work two things many years,
right?

389
00:23:42.770 --> 00:23:47.540
Then you will receive an email,
sing,
receive an email.

390
00:23:47.570 --> 00:23:52.040
If you notice,
you can investigate any crime,

391
00:23:52.100 --> 00:23:55.610
whether it's a social media abuse,
a bank,

392
00:23:55.611 --> 00:23:57.800
fraud in ATM fraud,

393
00:23:58.430 --> 00:24:03.430
because all the information today for these crimes are with the service provider

394
00:24:04.010 --> 00:24:09.010
and you need to know the legal and the standard process to ask this information.

395
00:24:09.620 --> 00:24:13.160
Once you get this information,
then you have to do traditional policing.

396
00:24:13.730 --> 00:24:17.150
So I came to know that this is the mobile handset of Russia.

397
00:24:17.180 --> 00:24:21.350
Tanglin Internet connection or Rakshit.
Tandon has committed this offense,

398
00:24:21.740 --> 00:24:24.890
so now I have to do traditional policy and go in arrest fracture tendon.

399
00:24:25.460 --> 00:24:29.330
Next step is the proper Caesar so that the digital evidence is collected

400
00:24:29.331 --> 00:24:33.560
properly and then the law,
the role of the forensic labs,

401
00:24:33.561 --> 00:24:38.120
which is again a challenge right now because the load is high,

402
00:24:38.240 --> 00:24:39.290
the complaints are higher.

403
00:24:39.370 --> 00:24:44.370
I was just looking at the figures of cert and it was in the newspapers recently

404
00:24:44.421 --> 00:24:48.380
with said from January,

405
00:24:48.380 --> 00:24:49.910
2017 to June,

406
00:24:49.910 --> 00:24:54.320
2017 we have reported somewhere around 27,482 cases.

407
00:24:54.830 --> 00:24:59.660
So that is making out to be approximately every 10 minute one cases happening.

408
00:25:00.590 --> 00:25:02.690
That does means that the reporting is there.

409
00:25:02.691 --> 00:25:06.620
I will take it positively because if I look at the police reports 10 years back

410
00:25:06.621 --> 00:25:10.310
when I started working,
they were not taking complaints.

411
00:25:10.520 --> 00:25:13.460
So when there were no complaints,
then the records were also not showing.

412
00:25:13.880 --> 00:25:18.170
But today that taking complaints and the RST is also there and you know what is

413
00:25:18.171 --> 00:25:19.470
a sad part of the arrest.

414
00:25:20.440 --> 00:25:25.440
And look at the fifth 2015 analisis of hence CRB a 5,108 people were escalate,

415
00:25:27.780 --> 00:25:32.780
committing cybercrime 3,188 we're in the age group of 18 to 30 and 98 we're in

416
00:25:34.911 --> 00:25:37.490
the age group of 18 below

417
00:25:39.410 --> 00:25:43.040
18 below.
Now this two things,

418
00:25:43.041 --> 00:25:48.041
if you look at that means what young people recently I saw on the newspaper also

419
00:25:49.641 --> 00:25:53.210
in one of our agencies confirmed it to me,
you know,
to Predation Deli Palace.

420
00:25:53.570 --> 00:25:57.980
They busted a racket where four young guys were arrested who had been to an

421
00:25:57.981 --> 00:26:02.760
online portal and using the technique of data tempering or something and they

422
00:26:03.860 --> 00:26:08.860
stole 94 lakh rupees vouchers or something and they were all young minds there

423
00:26:09.560 --> 00:26:13.130
it students and they call themselves ethical hackers.

424
00:26:13.700 --> 00:26:15.470
Now this is a challenge here.

425
00:26:15.620 --> 00:26:19.700
The thin line between ethical hacking and there's crime.

426
00:26:20.420 --> 00:26:24.950
So I at the end,
it again comes back to the same thing,
teach them laws.

427
00:26:24.951 --> 00:26:29.090
They don't even know what are the laws and a number two,
uh,

428
00:26:29.330 --> 00:26:34.250
organizations now need to be proactive.
Don't wait for something to happen.
So I,

429
00:26:34.251 --> 00:26:38.330
I today the mindset is that I will go and buy the best laptop from the showroom,

430
00:26:38.390 --> 00:26:42.920
but when it comes to software,
worry free download today,

431
00:26:42.960 --> 00:26:45.990
pirated.
And then I complained of cyber attacks.

432
00:26:46.800 --> 00:26:51.800
So it's very sad when I come to know that most of our important facilities are

433
00:26:52.051 --> 00:26:56.460
still running on old obsolete to us.
And when I,

434
00:26:56.520 --> 00:26:58.650
when I take talk shows in the people as it,

435
00:26:58.950 --> 00:27:03.000
so I've heard that of anybody can hack your phone in five second Monica.
Yes.

436
00:27:03.170 --> 00:27:06.300
When,
which phone are you using?
When,
okay,
what is the version of your oms?

437
00:27:06.600 --> 00:27:10.430
So it's five or 4.0.
When a please go and put it on the high way,

438
00:27:10.431 --> 00:27:14.580
way below the track.
It will be better.
It will have,
it will rest in peace.

439
00:27:15.030 --> 00:27:19.710
So the people are not understanding because if you're OSTP or your operating

440
00:27:19.711 --> 00:27:23.550
system is vulnerable to attacks,
it can easily be hacked.

441
00:27:24.210 --> 00:27:26.430
So people,
first thing has to be educated.

442
00:27:26.431 --> 00:27:29.470
Here is also how to be proactive in security.

443
00:27:29.471 --> 00:27:31.560
Do stone wait for something programmers,

444
00:27:31.590 --> 00:27:33.660
they don't know the secure coding framework.

445
00:27:33.990 --> 00:27:36.510
So now when I talk to engineering students,

446
00:27:36.960 --> 00:27:40.980
I tell them see it very easy to become an ethical hacker to find a loophole and

447
00:27:40.990 --> 00:27:41.823
exploited,

448
00:27:41.940 --> 00:27:46.140
but it's more difficult to create a code which nobody can hack and that is where

449
00:27:46.141 --> 00:27:47.640
the exact potential lies.

450
00:27:48.000 --> 00:27:51.210
So right now we are learning programming and you are in the first year of

451
00:27:51.211 --> 00:27:54.090
education and you want to develop a mobile app,

452
00:27:54.120 --> 00:27:56.280
you want to develop a website,

453
00:27:56.550 --> 00:28:00.810
start working on this and how to do this when you have to learn three aspects,

454
00:28:00.840 --> 00:28:05.580
attack,
defense and response.
Until unless you don't know attack,

455
00:28:05.640 --> 00:28:08.280
you cannot create a defense and response.
So yes,

456
00:28:08.281 --> 00:28:09.840
he will have to think like a hacker.

457
00:28:10.010 --> 00:28:15.010
You will have to know all the vulnerabilities and all the bad part of the coding

458
00:28:15.181 --> 00:28:17.340
and operating systems and databases.

459
00:28:17.640 --> 00:28:21.900
And there you will have to play a positive role in touching that up and creating

460
00:28:21.901 --> 00:28:25.140
an application outside in the market.
90% of the applications,

461
00:28:25.141 --> 00:28:28.020
they are launched in the market and they're not tested.

462
00:28:29.340 --> 00:28:32.900
And when they are not tested,
then you hear a very bad news in the newspaper,
x,
y,

463
00:28:32.901 --> 00:28:37.440
zed APP,
1.41 point 5 billion data breached and out.

464
00:28:37.441 --> 00:28:41.970
All the customer data is in public in the black market and who's the victim?

465
00:28:42.330 --> 00:28:43.410
The consumer is a victim.

466
00:28:44.100 --> 00:28:49.100
So this is how the old everything is flowing today and a new new modus operandi

467
00:28:51.451 --> 00:28:54.750
is,
are coming out and hackers are very proactive.

468
00:28:55.410 --> 00:29:00.410
I that day was handling a case where this a very simple complaint of a normal

469
00:29:00.451 --> 00:29:05.310
kidnapping case,
kidnapping case to place and the ransom was claimed on,

470
00:29:05.311 --> 00:29:07.110
uh,
we owe IP call.

471
00:29:07.980 --> 00:29:11.310
So some birth downloaded a third party application that you,

472
00:29:11.311 --> 00:29:14.910
millions of third party applications available online where you can create a

473
00:29:14.911 --> 00:29:17.190
call and the calling number would be very funny.

474
00:29:17.190 --> 00:29:20.670
Something like a three digit number or a four digit number or a 13 digit number.

475
00:29:21.480 --> 00:29:25.310
Today,
the law enforcement in my country is very smart and handling mobile

476
00:29:25.311 --> 00:29:28.650
surveillance.
We have been trained,
it's been 10 years now.

477
00:29:28.651 --> 00:29:32.930
We play with mobile surveillance,
but then people have left using mobiles.

478
00:29:32.940 --> 00:29:36.630
Now you don't use mobiles.
Now if you've taken the second step,

479
00:29:36.870 --> 00:29:38.280
that is called Internet calling.

480
00:29:38.850 --> 00:29:43.570
So now that again becomes a challenge for law enforcement and been this kind of

481
00:29:43.571 --> 00:29:48.420
cases are reported the police,
this is a matter of cybercrime sell.
Why?

482
00:29:48.430 --> 00:29:52.330
Because the call is coming through Internet.

483
00:29:52.750 --> 00:29:56.170
So these are the latest challenges we are facing.
And one more challenge,

484
00:29:56.171 --> 00:30:00.760
which I think is a big threat right now is these virtual numbers which are

485
00:30:00.761 --> 00:30:03.040
existing online and a wet.

486
00:30:03.130 --> 00:30:07.090
And especially in a country where we are trying to bring so many wallets,

487
00:30:07.710 --> 00:30:11.530
we are trying to bring so many mobile wallets and all these numbers are

488
00:30:11.531 --> 00:30:15.730
authenticated using her mobile number or a number,

489
00:30:15.790 --> 00:30:18.970
we call it a number.
So you can start using a wallet until,

490
00:30:18.971 --> 00:30:23.050
unless you have a number.
And for that number,
we simply use that authentication,

491
00:30:23.051 --> 00:30:26.410
which is the SMS authentication.
So what's your number is becoming a threat.

492
00:30:26.830 --> 00:30:30.790
And uh,
but then that is what will thing is a,

493
00:30:30.850 --> 00:30:34.570
it's like a mouse Katonah mouse race.
And uh,

494
00:30:35.350 --> 00:30:40.150
and this is how cybercrimes is evolving in India.
Thank you.
