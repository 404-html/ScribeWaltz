1
00:00:08.090 --> 00:00:10.820
So welcome everyone to this toxic Google event.

2
00:00:11.690 --> 00:00:14.010
We're here with Beau Lotto,

3
00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:18.950
who's going to be talking about his new book deviate.
So Bo is a,

4
00:00:18.951 --> 00:00:20.870
he's a world renowned neuroscientist,

5
00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:24.770
entrepreneur and also a two time Ted talk speaker.

6
00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:26.660
And in this book deviate,

7
00:00:26.661 --> 00:00:31.220
he's drawing from over two decades of two decades of research to reveal starling

8
00:00:31.221 --> 00:00:35.000
truths about how we perceive the world and how our brain perceives the world.

9
00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:37.190
So without further ado,
I'm going to leave it to Bo.

10
00:00:40.420 --> 00:00:43.880
<v 0>Um,
thanks for coming.</v>

11
00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:47.180
It's such a lovely day outside.
Nice to be,
uh,

12
00:00:47.310 --> 00:00:49.880
would have been nice to be out there.
We should do it out there.
Um,

13
00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:53.180
so we're going to talk about perception,
right?

14
00:00:53.181 --> 00:00:57.710
And actually everyone here in some senses is dealing with perception.

15
00:00:58.370 --> 00:01:02.360
And the reason is because perception underpins everything.
You think,
you know,

16
00:01:02.361 --> 00:01:04.520
you believe the clothes you wear,

17
00:01:04.521 --> 00:01:07.100
the people who fall in love with everything because with perception,

18
00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:11.210
so to understand perception is really to understand not just how the brain
works,

19
00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:14.420
which is what I'm interested in of course,
but what it is to be human.

20
00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:18.110
And if you really want to get people to see differently,

21
00:01:18.290 --> 00:01:22.170
we have to understand the principles by how we see in the first place.
All right,

22
00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:26.120
so a key question to perception then,

23
00:01:26.121 --> 00:01:27.740
which we've all been thinking about,

24
00:01:27.741 --> 00:01:31.130
in fact we've been thinking about for thousands of years,
is do we see reality?

25
00:01:31.131 --> 00:01:34.940
So how many here at Google?
Thank you.
See the world as it really is.

26
00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:36.550
<v 1>Okay.</v>

27
00:01:36.550 --> 00:01:39.670
<v 0>No,
there's always one.
If you're not seeing the world as it really is,</v>

28
00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:40.511
what do you seeing?

29
00:01:40.511 --> 00:01:42.580
How did you get here if you're not seeing the world accurately?

30
00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:45.273
<v 1>Sorry.</v>

31
00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:51.510
<v 0>So I think,
but I'm curious.</v>

32
00:01:51.511 --> 00:01:55.140
I mean I think you all think you see the world accurately.
Why?

33
00:01:55.141 --> 00:01:58.080
Because I think you all believe that illusions exist.

34
00:01:58.090 --> 00:02:00.480
So do you believe in illusion?
Yes.

35
00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:03.930
So an illusion by definition is to see the world differently from the way it

36
00:02:03.931 --> 00:02:06.570
really is.
So if you believe in illusions,

37
00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:09.480
you think that you actually evolve to see the world accurately.

38
00:02:09.481 --> 00:02:11.730
Most of the time it's just that sometimes you get it wrong.

39
00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:12.920
<v 1>Okay?</v>

40
00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:16.280
<v 0>So what we can do is do a quick test to see how good you are at seeing the world</v>

41
00:02:16.281 --> 00:02:18.470
accurately.
So how many bears do you see?

42
00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:20.120
<v 1>Okay,</v>

43
00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:24.850
<v 0>three.
Only three
did you say?
Oh you don't want to talk to,</v>

44
00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:28.180
okay,
keep looking around.
Look differently.

45
00:02:30.570 --> 00:02:31.403
<v 1>Right?</v>

46
00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:36.140
<v 0>Turn your head.
Imagine.
Can you see four</v>

47
00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:42.020
five,
six.
Do I hear six?
It's like an auction.

48
00:02:44.210 --> 00:02:48.260
You,
yeah,
there could be pandas.
It's a bear right there.

49
00:02:48.261 --> 00:02:49.550
11 bears hiding there,

50
00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:51.303
<v 1>right?</v>

51
00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:54.740
<v 0>The point is,
the more differently you look at something,
the more things reveal.</v>

52
00:02:54.741 --> 00:02:56.810
But that's actually quite a complex scene.

53
00:02:57.380 --> 00:03:01.120
So we could try something much simpler,
which is much more natural.

54
00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:04.450
So how many can see the Predator that's about to jump out at you?

55
00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:08.470
And if you haven't seen it yet,
you're dead right.
Especially here.

56
00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:14.320
So who thinks they can save the rest of the room?
Where do you think it is?

57
00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:22.150
Right up there at the top.
Okay,
you're dead.

58
00:03:23.580 --> 00:03:27.790
Okay.
Is it okay.
Let's just add 10% of the information.

59
00:03:27.791 --> 00:03:30.780
Cause 90% of the information you're brand new to see actually comes from gray

60
00:03:30.781 --> 00:03:35.110
scale.
So we'll add 10% of the information and can you find it now?

61
00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:39.010
All right,
for those who may be,
you shouldn't be at Google.
There it is.
Okay.

62
00:03:39.550 --> 00:03:43.480
So now if we go back,
you can see it was always staring at you,
right?

63
00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:44.320
It was always there.

64
00:03:45.010 --> 00:03:47.590
And this makes a really important point when it comes to vision,

65
00:03:47.740 --> 00:03:52.180
which is only 10% of the information you can come on in,

66
00:03:52.510 --> 00:03:54.940
which is only 10% of the information your brain uses.

67
00:03:54.941 --> 00:03:57.760
C actually comes from from your eyes.

68
00:03:58.540 --> 00:04:03.540
The other 90% comes from other parts of your brain is your eyes are almost

69
00:04:03.701 --> 00:04:07.990
pointless when it comes to vision,
right?
It's like the keyboard is to a computer.

70
00:04:08.230 --> 00:04:11.020
It's how you get the stuff in.
But it's very little to with at Jax.
You see?

71
00:04:11.910 --> 00:04:14.980
Alright,
so,
but again,
this is still a fairly complex scenes.

72
00:04:14.981 --> 00:04:18.970
Let's try something even simpler,
right?
Which is just lightness.

73
00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:24.120
Surely people that Google can see the world accurately in terms of light

74
00:04:24.191 --> 00:04:28.150
intensity,
right?
Even Jelly fish can see lightness and don't even have a brain,

75
00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:33.340
right?
So surely you can see the world accurately.
And if that's true,

76
00:04:33.341 --> 00:04:35.590
then things that are the same should always look the same.

77
00:04:35.590 --> 00:04:37.450
And things that are different should always look different.

78
00:04:37.930 --> 00:04:42.130
And these two circles are physically the same.
And do they look the same?
Yeah.

79
00:04:42.310 --> 00:04:44.530
All right.
So thank goodness,

80
00:04:44.560 --> 00:04:46.900
at least at this level you can see the world accurately.

81
00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:51.130
But what happens if I don't change those dogs?

82
00:04:51.550 --> 00:04:55.960
I just changed what surrounds them.
What happens to your perception?

83
00:04:56.920 --> 00:05:01.060
Do they still look the same?
No.
The one on the left,

84
00:05:01.061 --> 00:05:03.340
we'll probably look lighter in the one on the right.
Yes.

85
00:05:04.630 --> 00:05:08.050
And this makes it so nothing is actually changing on those circles.

86
00:05:08.410 --> 00:05:09.520
Just your perception of them.

87
00:05:10.540 --> 00:05:12.910
And this is a simplest illusion that your brain has,

88
00:05:12.911 --> 00:05:14.650
which is called simultaneous brightness contrast.

89
00:05:14.651 --> 00:05:16.240
And we really don't know how it works,

90
00:05:17.080 --> 00:05:21.070
but what it demonstrates the most basic level of vision of perception,

91
00:05:21.071 --> 00:05:25.000
which member underpins everything it is to be you.
Context is everything.

92
00:05:26.080 --> 00:05:30.910
Your brain did not actually evolve to do absolutes and evolve to do

93
00:05:30.911 --> 00:05:34.210
relationships.
It's not interested in less.

94
00:05:34.450 --> 00:05:37.240
It's contextual in contrast.
Okay.

95
00:05:37.330 --> 00:05:40.780
So much so that as you're looking at me right now,

96
00:05:41.170 --> 00:05:44.650
your eyes are actually moving.
They're called [inaudible] and Microsoft codes.

97
00:05:45.160 --> 00:05:49.930
And you can stop your eyes from moving by closing one eye,
sticking your finger,

98
00:05:50.200 --> 00:05:52.510
and to the tear duct can pushing back,
right?

99
00:05:52.511 --> 00:05:54.670
You can do at home with your kids or we're friends,
right?

100
00:05:55.120 --> 00:05:59.540
And you're basically pushing your eyeball back into its socket and your eyes

101
00:05:59.541 --> 00:06:02.540
stops moving.
What happens?

102
00:06:03.290 --> 00:06:06.740
Your eyes open and your eyeballs stopped moving.
What do you think happened?

103
00:06:08.060 --> 00:06:11.600
You go blind,
of course you'll go blind if you shove your finger into the back,

104
00:06:11.601 --> 00:06:14.510
right?
But if by just simply stopping,
I for moving,

105
00:06:14.720 --> 00:06:18.920
your brain has nothing interesting to see because it's only interested in change

106
00:06:18.921 --> 00:06:22.790
in space and time.
So if you stop change,

107
00:06:23.240 --> 00:06:26.390
your brain goes blind.
Okay?
So

108
00:06:29.460 --> 00:06:32.070
we've known that context is everything for a very long time.

109
00:06:32.071 --> 00:06:35.790
But if our deeper question is not that context is everything,

110
00:06:35.791 --> 00:06:40.680
but why it is and understand why context is everything is really to understand

111
00:06:40.681 --> 00:06:41.550
what it is to be human,

112
00:06:41.551 --> 00:06:44.490
but also to understand how it is we can help people to see differently.

113
00:06:45.970 --> 00:06:49.320
So I'm going to,
instead of telling you,
I'm going to show you,

114
00:06:49.380 --> 00:06:54.380
and this is actually at the heart of a machine vision of automatic automatic

115
00:06:55.170 --> 00:06:56.130
cars,
et cetera.

116
00:06:56.580 --> 00:06:59.850
This is the fundamental problem that visual systems evolved to salt.

117
00:06:59.851 --> 00:07:04.350
So hold up your finger and see if you can make your finger the same size as me

118
00:07:04.650 --> 00:07:08.070
by lining up your finger with me,
right?
The right finger.
Right?

119
00:07:09.360 --> 00:07:13.350
Can you make us the same size?
Yes.
Okay.

120
00:07:13.380 --> 00:07:17.630
We're not the same size,
right?
This is big,

121
00:07:19.170 --> 00:07:22.650
right?
But as far as your eye is concerned,
we are the same.

122
00:07:22.650 --> 00:07:26.610
It's because data that falls onto your eyes,
into your ears,
onto your skin.

123
00:07:26.611 --> 00:07:31.380
Conflates multiple aspects of the world in this case,
size and distance,
right?

124
00:07:31.560 --> 00:07:36.090
But the only access we have to the world is this is the data that your sense is

125
00:07:36.091 --> 00:07:36.924
the tech,

126
00:07:37.920 --> 00:07:42.870
but the data that your senses detect is completely meaningless.
Right?

127
00:07:43.650 --> 00:07:48.330
Which makes data itself.
So who's working on big data?
We're at Google,
right?

128
00:07:48.720 --> 00:07:51.450
Data is pointless,
right?

129
00:07:51.600 --> 00:07:55.320
It is literally pointless in of itself because it doesn't tell your brain what

130
00:07:55.321 --> 00:07:57.870
to do.
It doesn't come with instructions.

131
00:07:58.110 --> 00:08:00.120
It conflates multiple aspects of the world.

132
00:08:00.750 --> 00:08:04.110
And this is true at the most fundamental level of perception.

133
00:08:04.140 --> 00:08:07.260
It could be allowed being far away or quiet object or clothes,

134
00:08:07.500 --> 00:08:11.730
or a bright object on dark light or a dark object on the bright light,
right?

135
00:08:12.120 --> 00:08:16.470
These different aspects of the world can give rise to more two identical pieces

136
00:08:16.471 --> 00:08:19.680
of data,
but we know have no access to that world.

137
00:08:21.270 --> 00:08:26.270
So how does your brain deal with the fundamental challenge that it is to

138
00:08:27.211 --> 00:08:31.890
survive,
which is uncertainty?
This is the problem that every single brain,

139
00:08:31.891 --> 00:08:35.850
in fact,
every single neural net is adapted to deal with,

140
00:08:36.150 --> 00:08:37.740
which is uncertainty.
Ambiguity.

141
00:08:38.700 --> 00:08:42.600
So what's the other piece of information your brain has to see except for the

142
00:08:42.601 --> 00:08:47.040
data and the moment?
What else does it have?

143
00:08:47.041 --> 00:08:51.060
Access to memory experience.

144
00:08:51.240 --> 00:08:54.540
So the functional structure of your brain is literally a physical manifestation

145
00:08:54.541 --> 00:08:57.930
of its past with the world and not a passive interaction,

146
00:08:58.260 --> 00:08:59.730
but a physical interaction.

147
00:09:00.060 --> 00:09:04.320
Your brain makes meaning by physically interacting with the sources of the

148
00:09:04.321 --> 00:09:08.370
meaningless data and it makes meaning from it.
Okay?

149
00:09:08.730 --> 00:09:10.830
That's how your brain then shapes itself.

150
00:09:11.190 --> 00:09:13.260
It's not a passive receiving of information,

151
00:09:13.800 --> 00:09:17.370
which is why your brain actually evolved to continually redefine normality,

152
00:09:18.120 --> 00:09:22.770
right?
And you see everything relative to that continually changing normal.

153
00:09:23.490 --> 00:09:27.240
So I want to show you how quickly your brain can redefine normality by first

154
00:09:27.241 --> 00:09:29.970
noticing that those two desert scenes are basically the same.
Yes.

155
00:09:30.240 --> 00:09:32.610
One is just a flipping of the other in terms of color.
The same.

156
00:09:33.360 --> 00:09:36.510
I want you to stare at the dock between the red and the green.

157
00:09:36.930 --> 00:09:40.710
Don't look anywhere else,
okay?
We're going to do a bit of a magic trick,

158
00:09:40.711 --> 00:09:43.200
but it's gonna happen inside your head,
okay?

159
00:09:44.730 --> 00:09:48.120
So as you're staring at that dot,
your brain is redefining normality.

160
00:09:48.330 --> 00:09:51.960
It's learning that the less side of it's visual field is under greenlight,

161
00:09:52.200 --> 00:09:56.070
and the right side is under red.
That's becoming this new reality,
right?

162
00:09:56.550 --> 00:09:59.880
You're also getting very sleepy,
right?
Keep looking at that dot.

163
00:09:59.881 --> 00:10:01.680
Don't look anywhere else.
When I tell you to,

164
00:10:01.681 --> 00:10:06.510
I want you to look at the dot between the desert scenes,
but not yet.
Okay?
Five,

165
00:10:06.511 --> 00:10:11.490
four,
three,
two,
one.
Do they still look the same?

166
00:10:12.810 --> 00:10:16.380
No.
The one,
unless you look reddish,
the one on the right should look greenish.

167
00:10:16.710 --> 00:10:19.140
Yes.
And now as you look around,

168
00:10:19.141 --> 00:10:22.680
your brain will continue to redefine a melody again.
Yes.

169
00:10:23.250 --> 00:10:26.850
So that's how quick your brain redefines reality at the most basic level of

170
00:10:26.851 --> 00:10:30.480
lightness.
So when you open your eyes,
what do you see?

171
00:10:31.290 --> 00:10:35.040
You can't see the world as it really is because your brain is forever separate

172
00:10:35.041 --> 00:10:35.874
from that.

173
00:10:36.090 --> 00:10:39.300
You can't see the data or it would be pointless to see the data because it could

174
00:10:39.301 --> 00:10:40.134
mean anything.

175
00:10:41.100 --> 00:10:45.660
So instead what you see in the meaning that was useful to see in the past,

176
00:10:46.170 --> 00:10:49.320
you see what we call the empirical significance of information.

177
00:10:49.321 --> 00:10:52.290
You see the behavioral value of the data,
not the data.

178
00:10:52.320 --> 00:10:55.380
That is literally what you're seeing,
right?

179
00:10:56.040 --> 00:11:01.040
So the reason why your brain adapts is because what was once useful may no

180
00:11:01.051 --> 00:11:02.010
longer be useful.

181
00:11:02.880 --> 00:11:06.240
So your brain is continually redefining normality and seeing things relative to

182
00:11:06.241 --> 00:11:10.260
that changing normal.
So to give you a sense of what I mean by seeing meaning,

183
00:11:10.261 --> 00:11:11.790
we'll do it in the context of language.

184
00:11:11.791 --> 00:11:14.970
So we'll pretend like we're in a classroom.
Okay.
So the next few slides,

185
00:11:15.060 --> 00:11:19.650
I want you to read what you see.
We'll do it altogether.
Okay?
Ready?
One,
two,

186
00:11:19.651 --> 00:11:23.550
three.
Good.
One,
two,
three,

187
00:11:25.180 --> 00:11:26.400
one,
two,
three.

188
00:11:30.090 --> 00:11:34.770
Okay.
One,
two,
three.
What are you reading?
Right?

189
00:11:34.800 --> 00:11:38.520
Remember the instructions I said,
read what you see.
There are no words there.

190
00:11:38.521 --> 00:11:42.990
You all failed,
right?
That literally says why are written right?

191
00:11:43.050 --> 00:11:46.050
There's no law of physics tells you have to put an h between that.

192
00:11:46.051 --> 00:11:48.210
Wna Why do you do so?

193
00:11:48.540 --> 00:11:51.420
Because your brain has encode the statistics of core Korean letters in the

194
00:11:51.421 --> 00:11:52.710
English and other languages.

195
00:11:53.170 --> 00:11:57.970
So when you're presented with a completely arbitrary context of w space agey,

196
00:11:57.971 --> 00:12:00.820
you put an h there because it was useful to do so in the past.

197
00:12:01.570 --> 00:12:05.440
But there's no inherent value in this letter stream.
It's completely arbitrary.

198
00:12:05.441 --> 00:12:06.940
It doesn't exist without us.

199
00:12:08.140 --> 00:12:13.030
And also notice none of you read what you dreaming because I had you reading.

200
00:12:13.450 --> 00:12:14.830
That was your recent history.

201
00:12:14.860 --> 00:12:17.890
So you interpreted this in terms of your recent history.

202
00:12:18.370 --> 00:12:20.590
So you read what you're reading,
right?

203
00:12:21.010 --> 00:12:23.680
And this is true at the most basic level of perception.

204
00:12:23.920 --> 00:12:27.670
So if you think back to lightness,
which again is our simplest perception,

205
00:12:27.910 --> 00:12:31.420
you'll see a dark brown towel at the top and a light orange towel at the side.

206
00:12:31.421 --> 00:12:34.000
Yes.
That is your perceptual reality.

207
00:12:34.810 --> 00:12:38.050
You will split your life that they are different.
Yes.

208
00:12:38.530 --> 00:12:41.170
When in fact they're exactly the same.

209
00:12:42.500 --> 00:12:47.500
Nothing is changing on the screen at all except the meaning of the data you're

210
00:12:48.021 --> 00:12:49.430
seeing,
not the information,

211
00:12:49.431 --> 00:12:52.610
but the meaning of the information based on your history and not just your

212
00:12:52.611 --> 00:12:57.560
history,
the history of your culture and the history of evolutionary ancestors.

213
00:12:58.160 --> 00:13:01.670
Right?
Most of your life happened without you there.
Right.

214
00:13:02.060 --> 00:13:05.210
We come into the world with all kinds of perceptual meetings.

215
00:13:06.680 --> 00:13:09.860
What's true for color is also true for form.
So these two tables are the same.

216
00:13:10.860 --> 00:13:11.693
<v 3>Agreed.</v>

217
00:13:13.510 --> 00:13:17.760
<v 0>No.
What's wrong?
No,
the green,</v>

218
00:13:17.830 --> 00:13:20.020
the red table is simply the green table on its side.

219
00:13:20.380 --> 00:13:23.770
They have the exact same dimensions.
The only thing that varies,

220
00:13:23.771 --> 00:13:27.890
or the angles at the corner,
again,
you're seeing the meaning of the data,

221
00:13:27.920 --> 00:13:31.130
not the data.
It would be pointless to see the data.

222
00:13:31.131 --> 00:13:35.290
The data is they have the exact same dimensions but behaviourally that would've

223
00:13:35.300 --> 00:13:38.510
been useful in the past given the context.
Right?

224
00:13:38.900 --> 00:13:43.900
And what's true for color and form is also true for more complex perceptions,

225
00:13:44.091 --> 00:13:47.630
like the combination of light and sound.
So when I play this video,

226
00:13:47.631 --> 00:13:51.950
this is something we worked on for BBC and many years ago and it's called the

227
00:13:51.951 --> 00:13:55.760
McGurk effect.
And so when you,
when I play the sound,
you'll notice he says

228
00:13:55.950 --> 00:14:00.470
<v 4>spa is an f bomb.
Yes,
Bop bop,</v>

229
00:14:00.560 --> 00:14:05.310
<v 0>of course.
Right?
And on the right you'll notice he says bar as an a B Bar,
right?</v>

230
00:14:05.900 --> 00:14:09.710
<v 4>Bar Bar,
Bar bar.</v>

231
00:14:09.810 --> 00:14:12.450
<v 0>Yes.
Simple.
So when I played them both together,</v>

232
00:14:12.451 --> 00:14:15.450
you'd have far on the left and bar on the right

233
00:14:15.980 --> 00:14:19.880
<v 4>bar,
Bar,
Bar,
Bar,</v>

234
00:14:20.300 --> 00:14:25.250
Bar bar.
Great.
Now close your eyes.
Ah,
bar by many sounds.

235
00:14:25.251 --> 00:14:29.570
Do you hear bar bar,
Bar,
Bar,

236
00:14:31.100 --> 00:14:33.980
Bar?
There's only ever sound bar.

237
00:14:34.040 --> 00:14:39.030
If you see his lips make the shape of an hour,
you're a far the shape of a beat.

238
00:14:39.470 --> 00:14:42.860
You're a bar bar right bar.

239
00:14:43.100 --> 00:14:46.280
And notice the sounds not even coming from the screen is coming from the

240
00:14:46.281 --> 00:14:51.050
speakers.
Bop Bar Bar,
things changing,

241
00:14:52.070 --> 00:14:54.760
you're seeing the meaning of the data based on the cost.

242
00:14:56.090 --> 00:15:00.140
We could watch it all.
Ba,
Ba,
Ba,
Ba,

243
00:15:01.390 --> 00:15:05.730
<v 0>right?
Which means that life is actually really quite simple,</v>

244
00:15:06.450 --> 00:15:09.870
right?
Very fundamental,
very basic.
At any point in time,

245
00:15:09.930 --> 00:15:12.980
your brain is only ever making one choice,
right?

246
00:15:13.320 --> 00:15:15.780
One decision at a moment time,

247
00:15:15.900 --> 00:15:20.490
which is do I go towards something or do I go away from something?
Right?

248
00:15:20.850 --> 00:15:24.630
And where do you go towards or away?
The perceptions that you have,

249
00:15:24.631 --> 00:15:28.590
the behaviors or make are simply a reflex grounded in your history.

250
00:15:28.830 --> 00:15:33.830
You have no free will and what you're doing perceiving right now it's just like

251
00:15:34.471 --> 00:15:37.920
when the doctor hits your patellar tendon and your leg goes out,
right?

252
00:15:38.190 --> 00:15:42.750
It is a reflex and that reflex is grounded base on what was useful to do

253
00:15:42.751 --> 00:15:43.950
perceive in the past.

254
00:15:45.170 --> 00:15:46.003
<v 3>Okay,</v>

255
00:15:47.590 --> 00:15:52.030
<v 0>so where do you go towards or away is determined by your history,
your culture,</v>

256
00:15:52.031 --> 00:15:53.290
history,
your evolutionary history.

257
00:15:53.291 --> 00:15:55.900
You have very little control in the moment of what you're going to do,

258
00:15:57.260 --> 00:15:58.093
<v 3>right?</v>

259
00:15:59.160 --> 00:16:03.180
<v 0>So what you perceive,
the history that you perceive,</v>

260
00:16:04.290 --> 00:16:04.600
<v 3>okay,</v>

261
00:16:04.600 --> 00:16:07.120
<v 0>is not what the thing turned out to be.
It's not the data.</v>

262
00:16:07.180 --> 00:16:10.810
It's simply what you perceived before.
So what do you perceive now?

263
00:16:10.811 --> 00:16:14.950
What you do now is what you did before the history of your past perceptions.

264
00:16:15.940 --> 00:16:19.750
Okay?
So I'm going to show you how powerful this is in the context of sound.

265
00:16:19.751 --> 00:16:23.590
I'm going to get you to hear something that originally doesn't even exist,

266
00:16:23.770 --> 00:16:26.890
and it's going to be simply because of your history of having perceived it.

267
00:16:28.050 --> 00:16:30.660
<v 1>Do I want you to,
if not,
there are no words,</v>

268
00:16:33.210 --> 00:16:34.043
nothing interesting,

269
00:16:39.120 --> 00:16:43.580
<v 0>Bob Water.
Let's find out.
Let's try this,
right?</v>

270
00:16:44.180 --> 00:16:45.800
Read along and listen.

271
00:16:52.560 --> 00:16:55.700
<v 1>Did you hear that?
Are you getting better at it?</v>

272
00:16:55.770 --> 00:16:56.603
<v 0>Hearing it?</v>

273
00:16:56.880 --> 00:17:00.690
Notice you're getting better it hearing something that doesn't actually exist.

274
00:17:00.900 --> 00:17:04.830
You're becoming delusional,
right?
Which is actually the

275
00:17:06.390 --> 00:17:10.860
right,
which is the power and the beautiful thing about the human brain,
right?

276
00:17:11.100 --> 00:17:12.870
We perceive,
we can imagine,

277
00:17:13.620 --> 00:17:17.490
but the point here is that you're perceiving something based on your history of

278
00:17:17.491 --> 00:17:21.300
perceiving it.
And what does this sound?
It's simply this played backwards.

279
00:17:24.550 --> 00:17:27.810
<v 1>I'm not the one
another one,</v>

280
00:17:28.860 --> 00:17:29.440
<v 0>right?</v>

281
00:17:29.440 --> 00:17:34.440
Which means that you're like this little guy in a space of possibility.

282
00:17:35.980 --> 00:17:38.200
Your brain can never do big jumps.

283
00:17:38.320 --> 00:17:41.440
I can't get from here to the door without passing through the space between

284
00:17:42.100 --> 00:17:47.100
right at any moment in time you're going to make a choice and your choice is to

285
00:17:47.561 --> 00:17:51.900
go to the next most likely based on your history of experience.

286
00:17:52.200 --> 00:17:55.800
And we could represent this mathematically in terms of a space of possibility,

287
00:17:55.801 --> 00:17:59.820
a search space,
and you can't just teleport yourself around this space.

288
00:17:59.821 --> 00:18:04.140
You can only ever make small steps and you're going to make small steps to

289
00:18:04.141 --> 00:18:07.110
Pyramind by the,
by the dimensionality,

290
00:18:07.111 --> 00:18:11.370
the structure of the space zoom to go to the next most likely possible,

291
00:18:11.930 --> 00:18:16.230
right?
And what determines the structure of this space are your assumptions.

292
00:18:16.830 --> 00:18:20.550
That's what experience gives you.
It gives you your assumptions and biases,

293
00:18:21.600 --> 00:18:24.270
which means that everything you do is grounded in those assumptions.

294
00:18:24.270 --> 00:18:27.780
Not that sometimes you have an assumption,
you always have an assumption.

295
00:18:29.550 --> 00:18:33.570
So it's as if your brain has given us data is completely meaningless.

296
00:18:33.571 --> 00:18:36.510
Arbitrary data,
which is just energy from the world.

297
00:18:37.620 --> 00:18:39.420
And it constructs these present.

298
00:18:39.480 --> 00:18:43.680
There's perceptions and it projects out into the world,
right?

299
00:18:43.980 --> 00:18:46.320
So if a tree falls in the world and no one's there to hear it,

300
00:18:46.321 --> 00:18:49.410
does it make a sound?
The answer is no.
It creates energy,

301
00:18:50.010 --> 00:18:53.700
but it doesn't make a sound because the founders a construct of your brain.

302
00:18:53.850 --> 00:18:58.770
And the same way that this screen is not blue,
these chairs are not white,
right?

303
00:18:59.250 --> 00:19:02.790
That is not read your shirt.
It couldn't be closer to you.

304
00:19:02.791 --> 00:19:06.310
It's actually literally inside your head.
Projected outward,
right?

305
00:19:06.690 --> 00:19:09.660
We color objects,
we color the world.

306
00:19:10.110 --> 00:19:13.080
We are the source of those perceptions.
We color the world.

307
00:19:13.230 --> 00:19:15.240
Color is not a function of the world itself.

308
00:19:17.220 --> 00:19:21.810
And we project these meanings even to under more complex ideas.

309
00:19:21.811 --> 00:19:22.710
So here's an example.

310
00:19:22.711 --> 00:19:27.600
This was a video made in the 1919 mid 1940s and of course,

311
00:19:27.660 --> 00:19:31.680
there's nothing meaningful about these two triangles in this circle until we put

312
00:19:31.681 --> 00:19:32.514
them in motion.

313
00:19:35.180 --> 00:19:39.740
And immediately we start projecting a meaning onto these completely arbitrary

314
00:19:39.800 --> 00:19:40.633
objects,

315
00:19:41.790 --> 00:19:42.330
<v 1>okay?</v>

316
00:19:42.330 --> 00:19:47.000
<v 0>We start hating one fear for a full another,
right?</v>

317
00:19:47.280 --> 00:19:48.900
This is basically a horror film,

318
00:19:50.430 --> 00:19:51.263
<v 1>right?</v>

319
00:19:51.340 --> 00:19:52.173
<v 0>Watch.</v>

320
00:19:54.270 --> 00:19:55.103
<v 1>Okay?</v>

321
00:19:58.200 --> 00:19:59.700
<v 0>You're scared for the circle,</v>

322
00:20:09.390 --> 00:20:10.223
<v 1>right?</v>

323
00:20:10.410 --> 00:20:15.300
<v 0>The meanings don't exist on the screen.
Pain is a perfect example.</v>

324
00:20:15.301 --> 00:20:17.250
There's nothing painful in the world.

325
00:20:17.580 --> 00:20:22.580
Painful pain is a useful perception about the world that exists in inside your

326
00:20:23.311 --> 00:20:24.660
head,
right?

327
00:20:25.380 --> 00:20:29.550
And so what's true for color was true for objects is actually true for other

328
00:20:29.551 --> 00:20:30.384
people.

329
00:20:31.440 --> 00:20:34.620
You have no access to the spectral qualities of surfaces,

330
00:20:34.621 --> 00:20:38.220
but nor do you have access to inside what someone's inside someone's head.

331
00:20:38.760 --> 00:20:41.190
You have no access to another person's thought.

332
00:20:42.120 --> 00:20:45.780
People are just the sources of meaningless data,
right?

333
00:20:46.020 --> 00:20:48.280
You are the source of own meaningless data.

334
00:20:48.850 --> 00:20:51.040
You then project meaning onto them.

335
00:20:51.280 --> 00:20:56.080
Every personality you perceive is actually inside you projected outward.

336
00:20:57.730 --> 00:21:01.780
You have no way of determining whether or not your perceptions actually
accurate.

337
00:21:02.140 --> 00:21:03.100
When you connect with someone,

338
00:21:03.101 --> 00:21:06.430
it's because you're perceived meaning of them happens to coincide with their

339
00:21:06.431 --> 00:21:07.810
perceived meaning of themselves.

340
00:21:08.770 --> 00:21:09.220
<v 1>Okay?</v>

341
00:21:09.220 --> 00:21:11.480
<v 0>Right?
We color other people.</v>

342
00:21:12.420 --> 00:21:12.900
<v 1>Okay.</v>

343
00:21:12.900 --> 00:21:14.610
<v 0>You're a complete group within.</v>

344
00:21:14.820 --> 00:21:17.820
So I'm going to show you how powerful this is just simply in terms of a funny

345
00:21:18.020 --> 00:21:23.020
American football situation where notice how the behavior of the quarterback

346
00:21:23.611 --> 00:21:28.140
completely changes the his perceived meaning by the defense.
Okay?

347
00:21:28.730 --> 00:21:33.730
<v 1>[inaudible]</v>

348
00:21:44.520 --> 00:21:47.790
<v 0>you can do that one,
right?</v>

349
00:21:49.080 --> 00:21:52.650
So when it comes to perception,
which underpins everything,
it is to be human.

350
00:21:53.380 --> 00:21:56.290
We are just like this frog.
And I don't mean we're metaphoric.

351
00:21:56.291 --> 00:21:58.650
We'd like this frog.
I mean,
we're literally like this frog.

352
00:21:58.950 --> 00:22:00.840
So this is virtual reality for a frog.

353
00:22:01.420 --> 00:22:02.253
<v 1>All right?</v>

354
00:22:04.610 --> 00:22:07.570
<v 0>All right.
Is getting a stimulus and as January,
January behavior,</v>

355
00:22:07.571 --> 00:22:09.460
that was useful in the past,
just like us.

356
00:22:12.830 --> 00:22:14.810
It's like a Black Mirror episode for frog

357
00:22:17.230 --> 00:22:19.160
and he's doing fight.
Well,

358
00:22:22.720 --> 00:22:24.760
right.
We'll go quite her way.

359
00:22:24.761 --> 00:22:27.860
We also get a bit annoyed right now you're probably thinking,

360
00:22:28.010 --> 00:22:32.420
I'm not like a frog.
I've got free will,
right?
They might be frogs.

361
00:22:32.480 --> 00:22:34.690
I'm not a frog.
I forgot.
So we're going to test your fee.

362
00:22:34.691 --> 00:22:38.300
Will we're going to see if I can read everybody's mind in this room,
right?

363
00:22:38.301 --> 00:22:43.301
All at the same time by predicting what name you're going to give to completely

364
00:22:43.521 --> 00:22:47.930
arbitrary shapes.
These are meaningless shapes,
not circles.
Dimes as squares.

365
00:22:47.931 --> 00:22:50.900
They have no name the greed.
Yes.
Okay.

366
00:22:51.110 --> 00:22:53.930
I'm going to give you two completely arbitrary sounds.

367
00:22:53.990 --> 00:22:58.670
When is Kiki and the other is Booboo,
right?
They also don't mean anything.

368
00:22:59.510 --> 00:23:00.950
Now you independent free thinking.

369
00:23:00.951 --> 00:23:04.760
People tell me which of these shapes which has no name is Kiki and which of

370
00:23:04.761 --> 00:23:09.250
these shapes is moving right?
How are you on the right?

371
00:23:09.510 --> 00:23:12.490
Save boob was on the right and Kiki's on the left.
Yes.

372
00:23:12.910 --> 00:23:16.860
How long do you want to say the opposite?
So I read your mind,
right?

373
00:23:17.070 --> 00:23:21.420
Why is this happening?
Why do you tight,
uh,
associate them this way.

374
00:23:22.500 --> 00:23:24.300
It's the shapes.
What is it about the shapes?

375
00:23:26.510 --> 00:23:30.810
It could be the shapes of the letters.
It actually has to do with the sharpness,

376
00:23:30.990 --> 00:23:33.660
right?
It has to do with actually your perception of pain.

377
00:23:34.710 --> 00:23:38.220
Your brain has an overrepresentation of rounded this in sharp myth because it

378
00:23:38.221 --> 00:23:40.850
was behavioral useful to do so.
Right?

379
00:23:41.220 --> 00:23:44.370
And Kiki and booboo are sharp and rounded sounds.

380
00:23:45.080 --> 00:23:47.660
So if I give you the word love and hate,

381
00:23:48.260 --> 00:23:52.070
how many of you say the one on the right is love and the one on the left is
hate?

382
00:23:52.220 --> 00:23:56.450
Yes.
Depending on the state,
you have relationship,
right?
Right.

383
00:23:56.870 --> 00:24:00.230
Because if I give you the word hate and I prick your finger,

384
00:24:00.260 --> 00:24:05.180
I activate the same parts of your brain because hate is actually painful.

385
00:24:06.140 --> 00:24:10.940
It's the behavioral significance of the word that your brain is encoding,

386
00:24:11.560 --> 00:24:15.830
right?
And it's behavioral sickness of those sharp corners,
which is pain,

387
00:24:16.880 --> 00:24:20.030
okay?
This is the basis of metaphor.
You're mapping meanings.

388
00:24:20.240 --> 00:24:21.470
You're not mapping data.

389
00:24:22.460 --> 00:24:27.460
So if this is true of everything that I see is granted in my history and what

390
00:24:28.761 --> 00:24:29.511
that history gives me,

391
00:24:29.511 --> 00:24:32.930
your assumptions and those assumptions are essential for my survival.

392
00:24:32.990 --> 00:24:34.130
Every time I take a step,

393
00:24:34.250 --> 00:24:37.310
my brain has all kinds of assumptions that the floor is not going to give away.

394
00:24:37.460 --> 00:24:40.730
My legs aren't going to avoid.
These are essential for our survival.

395
00:24:41.540 --> 00:24:43.370
But the problem is the world changes.

396
00:24:43.700 --> 00:24:46.190
So what was once useful when they are longer be useful?

397
00:24:46.400 --> 00:24:48.230
So we have to change our assumptions,

398
00:24:49.090 --> 00:24:49.923
<v 1>right?</v>

399
00:24:50.210 --> 00:24:52.700
<v 0>And that's the basis for how we see differently.</v>

400
00:24:53.720 --> 00:24:56.420
Change your assumptions and you'll change your perception,

401
00:24:57.910 --> 00:24:58.460
<v 1>right?</v>

402
00:24:58.460 --> 00:25:02.900
<v 0>If you're a space of possibility is determined by your assumptions of what lies</v>

403
00:25:02.901 --> 00:25:07.190
right next to me is determined by what I assume to be true by changing what I

404
00:25:07.200 --> 00:25:10.910
assume to be true.
I'll change what Liz right next to me.
Okay.

405
00:25:11.060 --> 00:25:14.690
I'm going to show you how powerful this is simply in the context of perceived

406
00:25:14.691 --> 00:25:17.830
motion.
So as I put this into motion,
you'll see,

407
00:25:17.900 --> 00:25:20.180
probably assume it's spinning from left to right.
Yes.

408
00:25:20.810 --> 00:25:25.810
That's because your brain has the assumption that it looks down onto surfaces.

409
00:25:26.300 --> 00:25:28.010
We come into the world with this assumption,

410
00:25:28.011 --> 00:25:30.410
with this bias in the same way we come into the world,

411
00:25:30.411 --> 00:25:32.870
the assumption that light comes from above.
Okay.

412
00:25:33.290 --> 00:25:36.080
We incorporate the laws of physics into our perception.

413
00:25:39.570 --> 00:25:40.260
<v 1>Right?</v>

414
00:25:40.260 --> 00:25:44.220
<v 0>We'll come to that.
Okay.
So,
um,
so for most of you,</v>

415
00:25:44.330 --> 00:25:48.150
the most likely perception given the assumption is because your brain has a

416
00:25:48.151 --> 00:25:49.650
different assumption,
which you're not aware of,

417
00:25:49.890 --> 00:25:52.440
but I'll make it explicit in a second.
Sorry.

418
00:25:53.430 --> 00:25:57.030
But the explicit assumption is that you're actually looking up at the surface,

419
00:25:57.031 --> 00:26:00.500
not down and couldn't be a good way.

420
00:26:02.100 --> 00:26:06.900
Um,
so most of you will assume that your brain is actually looking down to that

421
00:26:06.901 --> 00:26:07.381
surface.

422
00:26:07.381 --> 00:26:10.530
If you're looking down at surface and the most likely perception is left or

423
00:26:10.531 --> 00:26:11.100
right,

424
00:26:11.100 --> 00:26:15.000
the possibility that spinning right to left is actually impossible given that

425
00:26:15.001 --> 00:26:15.834
assumption.

426
00:26:16.400 --> 00:26:16.700
<v 1>Okay.</v>

427
00:26:16.700 --> 00:26:21.700
<v 0>But if I put it into motion and you try to play with your assumption,</v>

428
00:26:22.311 --> 00:26:26.030
challenge assumption,
imagine looking up at it instead of down,

429
00:26:26.060 --> 00:26:27.560
it will then go in the opposite direction.

430
00:26:28.380 --> 00:26:29.213
<v 1>Right?</v>

431
00:26:30.680 --> 00:26:34.280
<v 0>So sometimes if you blur your eyes,
blink,
you can get it to flip.</v>

432
00:26:34.670 --> 00:26:37.790
So can you get it go the opposite direction or do you have it just going in that

433
00:26:37.791 --> 00:26:38.624
same direction?

434
00:26:40.470 --> 00:26:43.200
<v 1>Sitting here.
Here?</v>

435
00:26:44.320 --> 00:26:49.110
<v 0>Yes,
exactly.
Can you get to flip though?</v>

436
00:26:49.710 --> 00:26:54.530
Yeah,
but the reason why it's flipping is can you get us flip who often get it to

437
00:26:54.531 --> 00:26:59.010
flip?
Yeah.
Yeah.
Blur your eyes and blink and look around it.

438
00:27:02.180 --> 00:27:06.720
Yeah.
Okay.
You got it.
Okay.

439
00:27:07.020 --> 00:27:10.740
What's happening is basically when you assume when your brain has the assumption

440
00:27:10.741 --> 00:27:12.330
that you're looking down onto the surface,

441
00:27:12.331 --> 00:27:16.740
the most likely interpretation is left or right.
Right?
Given that assumption,

442
00:27:17.790 --> 00:27:21.300
as soon as you change that assumption that you're looking up at it,

443
00:27:21.360 --> 00:27:24.360
they'll most likely perception is it spinning the opposite direction from right

444
00:27:24.361 --> 00:27:28.560
to left.
What was previously possible becomes impossible.

445
00:27:28.561 --> 00:27:32.160
You can no longer see it spinning from left to right because you've changed your

446
00:27:32.161 --> 00:27:35.040
perception and every time you switch your perception,

447
00:27:35.041 --> 00:27:36.810
what your brain is doing is changing.

448
00:27:36.840 --> 00:27:40.500
It's assumption whether it's looking up or down because it has a different

449
00:27:40.501 --> 00:27:42.450
meaning.
Depending on that assumption,

450
00:27:43.230 --> 00:27:47.040
while the stimulus might be by stable mathematically it's not by stable in your

451
00:27:47.041 --> 00:27:51.330
head is determined by what assumptions you're making.
All right,

452
00:27:51.480 --> 00:27:55.560
so what was once impossible become possible once possibly becomes impossible.

453
00:27:56.610 --> 00:27:59.910
All you're doing is changing your assumptions and we're just talking about

454
00:27:59.911 --> 00:28:03.000
motion.
This is what creativity is.

455
00:28:04.050 --> 00:28:05.400
Your brain never does.

456
00:28:05.430 --> 00:28:08.520
Big Jumps in other brings to things that are far apart together.

457
00:28:09.030 --> 00:28:12.030
It only ever makes a small step,
right?

458
00:28:12.390 --> 00:28:15.960
But it changes what's next to it.
By changing its search space,

459
00:28:16.500 --> 00:28:20.310
by changing the assumptions that define that search space.
Right?

460
00:28:20.910 --> 00:28:23.580
So a quick question,
which is,
which direction is actually rotating?

461
00:28:25.020 --> 00:28:29.880
How many things left to right,
right to left.
I don't care.

462
00:28:30.750 --> 00:28:34.980
There's no emotion on the screen at all,
right?
There's literally no emotion.

463
00:28:37.170 --> 00:28:38.003
<v 3>Agreed.</v>

464
00:28:39.630 --> 00:28:42.270
<v 0>No,
I mean it's an animation,
right?</v>

465
00:28:42.390 --> 00:28:45.600
You're looking at a series of still images that are slightly different from each

466
00:28:45.601 --> 00:28:46.320
other.

467
00:28:46.320 --> 00:28:50.640
Your brain is taking that small change and seeing the meaning of the change,

468
00:28:50.641 --> 00:28:51.870
which we call five motion.

469
00:28:52.560 --> 00:28:55.860
If I took the all those images and put them in random sequence,

470
00:28:55.861 --> 00:29:00.030
you would simply see a flicker.
So you're seeing the meaning of the change,

471
00:29:00.031 --> 00:29:03.400
not the change.
Okay?

472
00:29:03.580 --> 00:29:07.210
So this idea that Trey activity is this chaotic,
messy,

473
00:29:07.211 --> 00:29:10.900
serendipitous process is predicated on the idea that the brain puts two things

474
00:29:10.901 --> 00:29:14.680
that are far apart together,
that it actually jumps teleport within it.

475
00:29:14.681 --> 00:29:18.490
Search space.
That's not how adaptive systems work.

476
00:29:18.850 --> 00:29:21.610
They only ever do small steps.
Okay?

477
00:29:22.390 --> 00:29:24.370
So if that's true,

478
00:29:24.850 --> 00:29:29.110
then in fact there's nothing creative about creativity is only created from the

479
00:29:29.111 --> 00:29:29.944
outside.

480
00:29:30.370 --> 00:29:34.150
When you see someone putting two things that are far apart together is because

481
00:29:34.151 --> 00:29:36.130
for you,
they are far apart together.

482
00:29:36.220 --> 00:29:41.110
You have a different search space for them.
They're making us not as simple.

483
00:29:41.260 --> 00:29:46.150
They're making a logical next step consciously or unconsciously to the next most

484
00:29:46.151 --> 00:29:50.440
likely possible based on their search space,
which is based on their assumptions

485
00:29:51.940 --> 00:29:53.680
because they have different assumptions,
different history.

486
00:29:53.681 --> 00:29:58.360
They have a different search space,
right?
And you think,
wow,
how did they do that?

487
00:29:58.361 --> 00:30:01.480
How do they bring those two things that far apart together?
Again for you,

488
00:30:01.481 --> 00:30:03.220
they are for them,
they're not.

489
00:30:04.090 --> 00:30:09.090
So creativity is this process of taking small steps to next most likely changing

490
00:30:09.311 --> 00:30:12.460
or spas.
Pace of possibility by questioning your assumptions.

491
00:30:13.480 --> 00:30:14.313
<v 3>Okay?</v>

492
00:30:15.230 --> 00:30:17.870
<v 0>And that's the basis for how we change our assumptions,</v>

493
00:30:18.770 --> 00:30:23.660
which is all revolutions begin with a joke.
They begin with a question.

494
00:30:24.350 --> 00:30:27.680
Nothing interesting begins with knowing.
It begins with not knowing,

495
00:30:28.860 --> 00:30:29.693
<v 3>right?</v>

496
00:30:29.760 --> 00:30:31.200
<v 0>It doesn't begin with an answer.</v>

497
00:30:31.260 --> 00:30:34.790
It begins with a question and it begins with a good question,
right?

498
00:30:35.520 --> 00:30:39.000
You could be a great experiment that's come up with a great experimental design.

499
00:30:39.120 --> 00:30:43.710
But if you're asking a bad question,
who cares?
The cash isn't a good question,

500
00:30:44.160 --> 00:30:45.720
not necessarily in the right answer,

501
00:30:46.540 --> 00:30:47.373
<v 3>right?</v>

502
00:30:48.170 --> 00:30:51.260
<v 0>So if you're actually wanting you to get someone to shift from a to B,</v>

503
00:30:52.160 --> 00:30:57.160
the first step is not actually be the first step is just to stop.

504
00:30:58.310 --> 00:31:02.990
The first step is to stop the association that you're making with that stimulus.

505
00:31:03.440 --> 00:31:05.390
The first step is to go to not a

506
00:31:06.510 --> 00:31:07.343
<v 3>right.</v>

507
00:31:07.480 --> 00:31:11.890
<v 0>If what I'm doing is I get a stimulus and automatic generate a meaning.</v>

508
00:31:12.400 --> 00:31:14.470
The first step is not to create a new meaning.

509
00:31:14.590 --> 00:31:19.180
The first step is to not make that meaning,
right.
To go to not a,

510
00:31:19.750 --> 00:31:21.880
and then once you're in that space of uncertainty,

511
00:31:22.000 --> 00:31:24.280
now you can go in multiple directions.

512
00:31:25.690 --> 00:31:30.310
So you can control the process of going to not a right,

513
00:31:30.400 --> 00:31:32.320
but you can't control where you go next.

514
00:31:33.370 --> 00:31:38.230
And we'll come to the importance of ecology for where you go next after.
Okay.

515
00:31:39.520 --> 00:31:40.510
But if this is true,

516
00:31:40.511 --> 00:31:44.950
if asking questions and in particular good questions is the basis of creativity,

517
00:31:44.951 --> 00:31:49.900
why is it so difficult to ask a good question?
Right?
Why is that so hard for us?

518
00:31:50.750 --> 00:31:54.250
I'm going to suggest two main reasons for this.
There are others,

519
00:31:54.251 --> 00:31:55.750
but these are two main reasons.

520
00:31:56.290 --> 00:31:59.630
And the first one is that we often walk through life thinking.

521
00:31:59.680 --> 00:32:03.610
We have an objective view of the world,
that we're rational,
right?

522
00:32:03.820 --> 00:32:07.450
That we have no assumptions and biases or will admit that sometimes we do.

523
00:32:07.451 --> 00:32:08.800
It's just that not always,

524
00:32:09.550 --> 00:32:12.580
but the point here is every time you make a resection of behavior,

525
00:32:12.581 --> 00:32:15.370
you have biases and assumptions.
You can never escape from them.

526
00:32:15.371 --> 00:32:19.660
You can change them.
You can never escape from having assumptions and biases,

527
00:32:20.000 --> 00:32:20.833
<v 3>right?</v>

528
00:32:21.950 --> 00:32:26.950
<v 0>So here's a game you can play when you have people around for dinner,</v>

529
00:32:27.180 --> 00:32:30.440
right?
And you can do it as a thought experiment right now to demonstrate the

530
00:32:30.441 --> 00:32:35.180
rationality of who we are.
I imagine you have a glass of water.
All right?

531
00:32:35.420 --> 00:32:40.040
And Imagine,
um,
uh,
spitting inside your glass of water.

532
00:32:40.160 --> 00:32:43.100
All right?
So do this at home when you have friends around,
right?
Imagine this,

533
00:32:44.120 --> 00:32:46.880
imagine spitting into your glass of water,
right?

534
00:32:47.390 --> 00:32:49.550
So now imagine drinking it.

535
00:32:51.440 --> 00:32:55.040
Do you get a sense of disgust,
but it's completely irrational,
right?

536
00:32:55.041 --> 00:32:58.550
What was once in your mouth,
you're simply putting right back in,
right?

537
00:32:58.580 --> 00:33:02.000
It's just part of you,
right?
But we can't,

538
00:33:02.001 --> 00:33:04.430
but help generate this perception of disgust,

539
00:33:04.790 --> 00:33:06.280
even though it's completely rational.

540
00:33:09.450 --> 00:33:12.410
No kids would be fine with it.
Even if it was someone else's saliva,

541
00:33:12.411 --> 00:33:14.800
they'd be fine with it,
right?
Right.

542
00:33:15.050 --> 00:33:19.550
So everything you do has a bias.
Everything you do has an assumption,

543
00:33:20.660 --> 00:33:24.650
okay?
But the other problem is that these assumptions are often hidden to us.

544
00:33:25.340 --> 00:33:28.580
We often have no idea why we do what we do.
In the same way,

545
00:33:28.581 --> 00:33:32.300
you didn't know why you necessarily name those two shapes,
Kiki and Booboo,

546
00:33:33.650 --> 00:33:34.360
<v 3>okay?</v>

547
00:33:34.360 --> 00:33:37.660
<v 0>Our assumptions are often hidden to us.
And here's an example of one.</v>

548
00:33:38.180 --> 00:33:41.270
<v 5>So there's nothing Barack Obama could do to prove that he was born here.
Uh,</v>

549
00:33:41.630 --> 00:33:45.740
if there was maybe witnesses that were attendance at his birth,

550
00:33:46.310 --> 00:33:49.940
his mother,
would you listen to his mother?
Now she has motivation to lie.

551
00:33:49.970 --> 00:33:54.170
Do you don't trust a drawn Donald Trump's birth certificate either?
Ah,
yeah.

552
00:33:54.200 --> 00:33:58.350
Because he's been here forever.
How do you know about you?
What's your proof?
Um,

553
00:33:58.490 --> 00:34:00.920
well,
his parents,
and they're biased.

554
00:34:00.921 --> 00:34:03.200
I'm talking about like people who could be the day be biased.

555
00:34:03.950 --> 00:34:06.110
I'm just using your logic against you.

556
00:34:09.880 --> 00:34:14.560
<v 0>And we laughed.
But we're no different,
right?
Everything we do,</v>

557
00:34:14.561 --> 00:34:17.770
our assumptions,
and we often don't know that we're aware that,

558
00:34:18.340 --> 00:34:21.490
that we're being guided our decisions or choices or being guided by these

559
00:34:21.491 --> 00:34:25.720
assumptions that are almost blind to us,
right?
We're blind to them,

560
00:34:26.300 --> 00:34:30.330
right?
Hence the power of diversity of groups,
right?

561
00:34:30.550 --> 00:34:34.210
So diversity of groups have to see at least two significances.
First of all,

562
00:34:34.270 --> 00:34:38.140
the best person to reveal your own assumptions to you is rarely you.

563
00:34:38.620 --> 00:34:42.280
It's usually someone else and the right kind of environment.

564
00:34:42.790 --> 00:34:44.170
So if you give me two groups,

565
00:34:44.260 --> 00:34:48.340
one average lower Iq from a more diverse background versus another group,

566
00:34:48.341 --> 00:34:52.360
which is higher average Iq,
but from the same background,
I want the first group,

567
00:34:53.140 --> 00:34:55.480
right?
Because in that group and the right setting,

568
00:34:55.600 --> 00:34:59.440
they're more likely to reveal their own assumptions to each other.
What's more,

569
00:34:59.800 --> 00:35:03.890
the search space of that group is much more complex,
right?

570
00:35:03.910 --> 00:35:07.150
It's a higher dimensional search space cause they have more diverse assumptions.

571
00:35:07.151 --> 00:35:08.860
We know from complex systems theory,

572
00:35:09.400 --> 00:35:13.640
the best solutions are more likely to exist in a more complex search space than

573
00:35:13.650 --> 00:35:16.960
in a simpler search space.
As simpler search space is more adaptable,

574
00:35:17.110 --> 00:35:18.700
more evolvable,
right?

575
00:35:19.180 --> 00:35:22.360
But it's actually less likely to hold the best solution.

576
00:35:23.170 --> 00:35:24.730
So I want the first group,

577
00:35:25.150 --> 00:35:29.080
I discovered what my assumptions are and I can occupy within a more complex

578
00:35:29.081 --> 00:35:33.910
search space in the right environment,
which I'll come to you in a moment.
Right?

579
00:35:34.240 --> 00:35:37.530
And the kind of search space and the kind of combination diversity that tend to

580
00:35:37.550 --> 00:35:41.940
work with his expert with naive and the reason because experts are super

581
00:35:41.941 --> 00:35:46.320
efficient,
right?
But they're terrible asking a good question.

582
00:35:47.070 --> 00:35:50.280
But what's ironic is they can recognize a good question when asked.

583
00:35:51.660 --> 00:35:53.280
Whereas people who are naive,

584
00:35:54.510 --> 00:35:57.960
they can ask great questions but they don't know they're great questions.

585
00:35:58.800 --> 00:36:01.510
So we find it's a great combination.
Right?

586
00:36:01.980 --> 00:36:04.680
And also the power of actually stepping into a space,

587
00:36:04.681 --> 00:36:06.180
which is different from what you know.

588
00:36:06.660 --> 00:36:10.650
So you can actually shift yourself from expert and naive back and back and
forth.

589
00:36:11.250 --> 00:36:14.220
So you can occupy both ways of being at the same time.

590
00:36:15.270 --> 00:36:16.290
So both in groups,

591
00:36:16.291 --> 00:36:20.910
but also internally is the combination of expert and I and also think about

592
00:36:20.911 --> 00:36:25.380
technologies obviously here.
So what defines the best technology?

593
00:36:26.310 --> 00:36:30.060
One argument is that it's not what enables us to do what we can already do

594
00:36:30.061 --> 00:36:34.140
faster,
easier with less friction.
Those are good technologies are useful,

595
00:36:34.440 --> 00:36:38.640
but not necessarily transformative.
What are the ones that are transformative?

596
00:36:39.120 --> 00:36:41.790
I'd suggest they make the invisible visible.

597
00:36:42.750 --> 00:36:47.750
They enable us to see what we couldn't see before a microscope or telescope MRI,

598
00:36:48.900 --> 00:36:53.310
even a book,
being able to travel to a new culture,
right?

599
00:36:53.640 --> 00:36:57.750
Because not only does that reveal our own assumptions to ourself and enables us

600
00:36:57.751 --> 00:37:01.140
to expand the complexity of our assumptions.

601
00:37:01.630 --> 00:37:02.463
<v 3>All right.</v>

602
00:37:03.090 --> 00:37:07.530
<v 0>The shift from being the center of the universe to then revolving around,</v>

603
00:37:07.531 --> 00:37:10.920
orbiting around the sun completely changed our assumptions of what it was to be

604
00:37:10.921 --> 00:37:11.754
human.

605
00:37:12.810 --> 00:37:16.560
Those are transformative technologies that enable us to see what we couldn't see

606
00:37:16.561 --> 00:37:17.394
previously,

607
00:37:18.080 --> 00:37:18.913
<v 3>right?</v>

608
00:37:19.150 --> 00:37:22.000
<v 0>Which is why creativity actually begins with humility.</v>

609
00:37:22.060 --> 00:37:23.500
It begins with not knowing.

610
00:37:24.530 --> 00:37:24.860
<v 3>Okay?</v>

611
00:37:24.860 --> 00:37:28.770
<v 0>So actually one of my aims in this talk is that you know less at the end than</v>

612
00:37:28.771 --> 00:37:33.170
you think you know now,
right?
Because nothing interesting begins with knowing.

613
00:37:34.010 --> 00:37:35.660
It begins with not knowing.

614
00:37:36.710 --> 00:37:41.180
So the second one and the most difficult is it might be that you now accept that

615
00:37:41.181 --> 00:37:41.331
you,

616
00:37:41.331 --> 00:37:46.331
everything you do as a bias and assumption and that you're going to now try to

617
00:37:46.461 --> 00:37:49.580
reveal what they are to yourself or through others.

618
00:37:50.570 --> 00:37:53.360
But now you have the next step,
which is to question them.

619
00:37:54.380 --> 00:37:59.000
But we hate not knowing because to question assumption,

620
00:37:59.240 --> 00:38:02.900
especially in assumptions that define who you are puts you into uncertainty.

621
00:38:03.710 --> 00:38:07.850
And we hate uncertainty to not be sure that was a predator.

622
00:38:07.880 --> 00:38:08.810
It's too late.

623
00:38:09.260 --> 00:38:12.470
Your brain evolved to take what is uncertain and to make it certain.

624
00:38:13.310 --> 00:38:16.370
So when you go down below on a boat and your eyes are moving and registered to

625
00:38:16.371 --> 00:38:18.290
vote,
and your eyes are saying,
oh,
we're standing still,

626
00:38:18.680 --> 00:38:20.570
but your inner ears is saying,
no,
no,
we're moving.

627
00:38:20.930 --> 00:38:22.610
And your brain cannot not deal with that conflict,

628
00:38:22.611 --> 00:38:24.410
which is one of the reasons why you get seasick.

629
00:38:25.010 --> 00:38:27.240
So you'd go above deck and you watch her eyes.

630
00:38:27.280 --> 00:38:29.690
So your eyes are interrupters and moving in registered,
right.

631
00:38:30.020 --> 00:38:34.940
We hate uncertainty because dying is easy

632
00:38:36.790 --> 00:38:37.421
to step into.

633
00:38:37.421 --> 00:38:41.020
Uncertainty is literally to not know throughout evolution was to increase the

634
00:38:41.021 --> 00:38:45.790
probability of dying.
Your brain evolved to predict the better stable to brick,

635
00:38:45.791 --> 00:38:49.420
the more likely it is able to survive.
Okay.

636
00:38:50.860 --> 00:38:54.670
And what's more,
the best questions create the most uncertainty.

637
00:38:55.540 --> 00:38:58.720
So for instance,
imagine we were a model,
your biases,

638
00:38:58.721 --> 00:39:01.390
your assumptions as a network,
right?

639
00:39:01.450 --> 00:39:04.570
Which we could do with the gene regulatory network or your biases,
right?

640
00:39:04.780 --> 00:39:07.690
And in the upper left,
those your biases that you're,

641
00:39:08.260 --> 00:39:10.270
that are not connected to each other,
right?

642
00:39:10.420 --> 00:39:14.440
It'd be like a gene that's in coding the color of your eyes.
Okay.
Now,

643
00:39:14.441 --> 00:39:17.560
if we were to question that bias and metaphoric,
we move it.

644
00:39:18.100 --> 00:39:20.560
Nothing else changes just that wild.

645
00:39:22.030 --> 00:39:25.900
Now imagine instead you questioned abayas,
you move a bias,

646
00:39:25.901 --> 00:39:28.540
it's fully connected to all the other assumptions,

647
00:39:28.750 --> 00:39:31.840
what something that may be defines what it is to be you.

648
00:39:32.260 --> 00:39:33.190
That would be an example of say,

649
00:39:33.191 --> 00:39:36.850
a homeobox gene that determines the segmentation of the body,
right?

650
00:39:37.120 --> 00:39:41.110
If you shift that buys the same amount of energy,
same amount of movement,

651
00:39:41.500 --> 00:39:44.940
the whole system shifts,
okay?

652
00:39:45.230 --> 00:39:48.530
This is what we call a complex systems,
a point of self criticality,

653
00:39:49.520 --> 00:39:53.360
and here's an ex,
we experienced this in nature all the time.
Here's an example.

654
00:39:53.750 --> 00:39:58.040
This snow bank is under a tremendous amount of tension because it's fully

655
00:39:58.041 --> 00:40:02.810
connected.
You add a small amount of weight and the whole thing gives way.

656
00:40:04.350 --> 00:40:08.800
All right?
So great questions can cause massive shifts,

657
00:40:11.110 --> 00:40:12.670
right?
And uncertainty,

658
00:40:13.560 --> 00:40:14.240
<v 1>okay,</v>

659
00:40:14.240 --> 00:40:17.120
<v 0>and now you're all wondering whether or not he survived.
Yeah,
yeah.</v>

660
00:40:17.150 --> 00:40:18.880
I'm not going to fill you just fit,
right,

661
00:40:19.130 --> 00:40:24.080
because you're experiencing uncertainty,
right?

662
00:40:24.110 --> 00:40:29.000
That's what it is.
The answer you want to know.
Right?
We hate not knowing,
right?

663
00:40:29.030 --> 00:40:31.340
And sitting with that moment of not knowing,

664
00:40:31.940 --> 00:40:36.940
and yet the irony is that the only place you can go if you're ever going to be

665
00:40:37.041 --> 00:40:41.360
creative is to step into uncertainty.
And again,

666
00:40:41.361 --> 00:40:44.250
to be uncertainty creates a tremendous amount of stress,

667
00:40:44.251 --> 00:40:48.380
is one of our biggest sources of unwellness in our world,
right?

668
00:40:48.381 --> 00:40:50.840
Is this be an uncertainty,
right?

669
00:40:51.170 --> 00:40:55.400
It actually decreases connectivity with feminine brain decreases adaptability,

670
00:40:55.430 --> 00:40:56.900
increases brain cell death.

671
00:40:57.170 --> 00:40:59.420
It actually makes you a more extreme version of yourself.

672
00:40:59.421 --> 00:41:01.840
If you're liberal and become more liberal.
If you're a conservative,

673
00:41:01.841 --> 00:41:02.900
you become more conservative.

674
00:41:02.990 --> 00:41:07.700
You go to a place that is familiar almost every behavior you do,

675
00:41:07.820 --> 00:41:11.630
you do in order to increase certainty,
right?

676
00:41:11.690 --> 00:41:14.660
You could argue is one of the reasons why Uber was originally successful,

677
00:41:15.260 --> 00:41:19.850
not because they enabled you to order a taxi easier is because they told you

678
00:41:19.851 --> 00:41:24.630
when the taxi was going to arrive.
If I put you in San Francisco,

679
00:41:24.631 --> 00:41:28.910
on the street corner,
you're trying to catch a taxi,
right?
And after five minutes,

680
00:41:29.570 --> 00:41:31.580
all of these are going by.
You're completely stressed,

681
00:41:31.581 --> 00:41:34.670
your cortisol levels are going,
and finally you get the taxi.

682
00:41:34.820 --> 00:41:37.910
Now instead I sit you on the same street corner and after five minutes I say,

683
00:41:37.970 --> 00:41:41.480
don't worry,
it'll be there in five minutes,
right?
You're using your phone,

684
00:41:41.481 --> 00:41:46.220
your cortisol levels go down,
et cetera.
Right?
It's because of uncertainty,

685
00:41:47.010 --> 00:41:50.900
right?
Which is why in London now,
they put the times on all the bus stops,

686
00:41:51.080 --> 00:41:53.420
even though it's going to be an hour and a half before the bus gets there.

687
00:41:53.421 --> 00:41:56.390
But no one is going to be an hour and a half.
Decreases your stress.

688
00:41:56.820 --> 00:42:00.260
I had terminal five and Heathrow.
Wonderful.
Classic example.

689
00:42:00.380 --> 00:42:03.140
You get off the Heathrow express,
you go on Twitter list,

690
00:42:03.830 --> 00:42:07.250
there's only one place for this lift to go,
which is one floor up to departures.

691
00:42:07.790 --> 00:42:12.050
So you step in,
the door is shut and now you're trapped.
Right?

692
00:42:12.051 --> 00:42:14.540
Cause there's no button to tell you to go to floor one.

693
00:42:14.870 --> 00:42:18.770
So the first experience that has millions and millions of dollars terminal was

694
00:42:18.771 --> 00:42:22.580
stress,
right?
Because of uncertainty.
So what did they do?

695
00:42:22.700 --> 00:42:26.350
They put a little button on the lift that when you touched it,

696
00:42:26.370 --> 00:42:30.140
the light went on and it was connected to nothing else.
Right?

697
00:42:30.740 --> 00:42:33.740
So you walked in lifts,
he had this sense that,
ah,
thank goodness,
now it goes,

698
00:42:33.741 --> 00:42:35.900
it was always going to go up,
right?

699
00:42:35.930 --> 00:42:37.640
It was always going to do exactly what it's doing.

700
00:42:37.641 --> 00:42:40.850
But you had this sense of certainty.
Now,
familiarity,
right?

701
00:42:41.060 --> 00:42:44.780
We hate uncertainty.
And again,

702
00:42:44.781 --> 00:42:47.900
that's the only place we can go if we're going to be creative.

703
00:42:48.050 --> 00:42:51.230
So how does the brain deal with uncertainty?

704
00:42:51.740 --> 00:42:55.970
Because what's more that uncertainty and stress reduces your space of

705
00:42:55.971 --> 00:42:59.960
possibility.
In fact,
here's an example of a space of possibility reducing twists.

706
00:42:59.961 --> 00:43:04.490
Single dimension.
This happened.
Australia is going in to rob a bank.

707
00:43:04.520 --> 00:43:07.220
This actually happened.
He hands the teller a note,
right?

708
00:43:08.150 --> 00:43:12.260
And now suddenly the bank gets shutdown.
He's trapped,
he's stuck,
right?

709
00:43:12.261 --> 00:43:14.390
He's locked in.
But in fact,

710
00:43:14.391 --> 00:43:17.600
he's locked within a completely narrow space of possibility.

711
00:43:18.650 --> 00:43:23.600
One dimension,
because he's forgotten that doors poor as well as push.

712
00:43:24.310 --> 00:43:25.130
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

713
00:43:25.130 --> 00:43:29.690
<v 0>Right?
So he was trapped by his search space,
not by the door.</v>

714
00:43:30.350 --> 00:43:34.500
He was caught five minutes later.
Right?
Whereas it wasn't actually,

715
00:43:34.930 --> 00:43:39.320
it wasn't locked.
Their door was always open,
but he was pushing against it.

716
00:43:39.650 --> 00:43:42.560
Right?
Because the search space went down to a single dimension.

717
00:43:43.580 --> 00:43:46.520
And that's what happens when you get stressed from uncertainty,
right?

718
00:43:47.210 --> 00:43:50.800
So how can the brain,

719
00:43:50.801 --> 00:43:54.130
but if the only place we can go to be creative as a step into uncertainty,

720
00:43:54.131 --> 00:43:57.130
the very place that our brain evolved to avoid,

721
00:43:58.060 --> 00:43:59.890
how is it that we can actually go there?

722
00:44:00.280 --> 00:44:03.610
What is evolution solution towards certain certainly could is essential in order

723
00:44:03.670 --> 00:44:07.240
to adopt that.
We're able to go there.
So evolution gave us a solution.

724
00:44:07.360 --> 00:44:11.650
So what's the one thing that you do where you actually love uncertainty?

725
00:44:12.040 --> 00:44:14.320
It's not that you tolerate it,
you actually seek it.

726
00:44:14.890 --> 00:44:16.270
What's the one thing that you do?

727
00:44:17.910 --> 00:44:18.743
<v 1>Yeah,</v>

728
00:44:19.610 --> 00:44:23.480
<v 0>play.
Play is evolution.
Solution to uncertainty.</v>

729
00:44:23.510 --> 00:44:26.300
It is why play evolved,
right?

730
00:44:26.840 --> 00:44:31.410
What's more play is a way of being,
okay.

731
00:44:31.830 --> 00:44:33.720
It's a way for those who study play.

732
00:44:33.780 --> 00:44:35.580
It's not just running around in a playground.

733
00:44:35.700 --> 00:44:39.900
It is literally a serious way of being that our brain evolved to have.

734
00:44:40.380 --> 00:44:45.090
Okay.
And if we add intention to play,
we get science.

735
00:44:46.050 --> 00:44:49.460
Science is nothing other than play with intention,
right?

736
00:44:49.650 --> 00:44:54.650
Empiricism is inherent to the brain and how you define science and how do you

737
00:44:55.111 --> 00:44:58.110
define plates so it's not likely.
It literally is play.

738
00:44:59.040 --> 00:45:01.470
When we created a education program based on this,

739
00:45:01.471 --> 00:45:05.100
it result in the youngest published scientist and road age eight to 10 years old

740
00:45:05.190 --> 00:45:09.390
and the youngest ever Ted Speaker,
right?
Because if you add rules to play,

741
00:45:09.391 --> 00:45:14.190
you have a game.
That's an experiment,
but it's rethinking what sciences,

742
00:45:14.191 --> 00:45:17.430
which is not a methodology that is the craft of science,

743
00:45:17.431 --> 00:45:19.010
but that's not what defines science.

744
00:45:19.280 --> 00:45:22.840
Science is this way of being which celebrates uncertainty,
right?

745
00:45:23.190 --> 00:45:26.310
It's encourages diversity.
It's actually how we create diversity.

746
00:45:26.400 --> 00:45:27.780
The function of sciences,
in fact,

747
00:45:27.781 --> 00:45:32.610
it increased uncertainty because quality of science isn't the question you ask,

748
00:45:33.300 --> 00:45:37.800
right?
It's open to possibilities inherently cooperative and since intrinsically

749
00:45:37.801 --> 00:45:40.440
motivated.
What does it mean to be intrinsically motivated?

750
00:45:40.441 --> 00:45:43.470
Almost everything you do,
you do for reward that's different from what you do.

751
00:45:44.370 --> 00:45:49.080
What is the reward for skiing
it's scheme?

752
00:45:50.010 --> 00:45:53.970
The reward for play is play itself is intrinsically motivating.

753
00:45:54.420 --> 00:45:57.750
And that's true for anything that is in the process of discovery.

754
00:45:58.050 --> 00:46:02.100
The reward of science,
the reward of discovery is the discovery itself.

755
00:46:03.090 --> 00:46:05.670
And these are actually what defines play.

756
00:46:06.480 --> 00:46:09.300
And if we add intention to play,
you have science

757
00:46:13.070 --> 00:46:13.903
<v 6>science.</v>

758
00:46:20.190 --> 00:46:22.590
<v 0>That's true.
So I'm not talking about the output of science,</v>

759
00:46:22.591 --> 00:46:25.890
but I wouldn't say science is about truth.
Science is about utility.

760
00:46:26.450 --> 00:46:31.290
Evolution is not about truth.
Evolution is about what's useful about predictable,

761
00:46:31.950 --> 00:46:35.580
right?
Even with our mathematics,
we have therms,
therms,
all the theorems are,

762
00:46:35.581 --> 00:46:38.730
is making explicit what your assumptions are.
Given these set of assumptions,

763
00:46:38.820 --> 00:46:40.350
this is what we believe to be true.

764
00:46:40.650 --> 00:46:43.920
True is that this is far more predictable than that was.

765
00:46:45.030 --> 00:46:47.580
So my theory of neuroscience,
for instance,

766
00:46:47.581 --> 00:46:50.700
I'm looking at neurotrophic factors and brain cell growth,
right?

767
00:46:51.000 --> 00:46:55.290
I'm looking empirically to see what is the most likely explanation for the data

768
00:46:55.291 --> 00:46:55.710
that I've got.

769
00:46:55.710 --> 00:46:59.940
I'm looking for understanding that decreases dimensionality of the space of

770
00:46:59.941 --> 00:47:01.830
possibility of a search,
right?

771
00:47:02.940 --> 00:47:07.830
So if I can reduce it to one variable,
verse two,
I have a better explanation,

772
00:47:09.030 --> 00:47:13.830
right?
That's utility.
That's useful.
I'm making a prediction.
Is it true?

773
00:47:13.890 --> 00:47:16.940
Well then we get into the semantics of what true is.
Right?

774
00:47:17.820 --> 00:47:19.100
And you could argue that is truth.

775
00:47:20.160 --> 00:47:23.820
To be able to predict in every single search situation is potentially true,

776
00:47:24.090 --> 00:47:27.660
right?
But in terms of,
for instance,
what your brain is doing,

777
00:47:28.020 --> 00:47:30.460
if your brain is the cricket or when,
uh,

778
00:47:30.790 --> 00:47:35.650
when the male flies trying to mate with the female fly and is trying to predict

779
00:47:35.651 --> 00:47:38.530
her trajectory,
we can mathematically model that.

780
00:47:39.130 --> 00:47:43.360
Is that mathematical model actually happening inside that brain?
No.
Right.

781
00:47:43.510 --> 00:47:47.710
Is genuine and behavior that is useful.
Right?

782
00:47:48.070 --> 00:47:51.760
Empirically over the course of evolution,
learning and development,

783
00:47:53.210 --> 00:47:56.280
right?
So science is about,
absolutely,
I'm not saying this,

784
00:47:56.281 --> 00:47:59.350
this postmodern relativism atol most of my relatives,
it doesn't exist.

785
00:47:59.351 --> 00:48:02.650
It did evolution from to exist.
Some things are better than others.

786
00:48:03.100 --> 00:48:07.620
We just don't know what they are.
A Pri,
which is why we have empiricism,
right?

787
00:48:07.750 --> 00:48:12.750
What we get from that is truth in the sense that it's highly predictable or more

788
00:48:12.761 --> 00:48:14.110
predictable than the previous theory.

789
00:48:15.850 --> 00:48:16.683
<v 3>Okay.</v>

790
00:48:17.070 --> 00:48:20.010
<v 0>And the way we do that,
but that's the process of science.</v>

791
00:48:20.011 --> 00:48:23.520
That's the scientific method,
but in order to do that,

792
00:48:23.521 --> 00:48:27.870
you have to be able to ask a good question and an to asks a question.

793
00:48:27.930 --> 00:48:32.130
You have to celebrate the possibility of being wrong,
of not knowing.

794
00:48:33.240 --> 00:48:33.870
Right.

795
00:48:33.870 --> 00:48:38.310
So my suggestion is that what underpins good science is a way of being that we

796
00:48:38.311 --> 00:48:41.730
actually called play and it underpins not just science,

797
00:48:41.790 --> 00:48:45.240
anything that is creative,
whereas play has no intention.

798
00:48:45.420 --> 00:48:46.950
It's just simply for the sake of it.

799
00:48:47.280 --> 00:48:50.340
Something like science or art actually has an intention in it,

800
00:48:50.490 --> 00:48:53.890
is trying to do something right.
See what to me

801
00:48:55.060 --> 00:48:58.150
<v 7>earlier you had a video of people arguing about,
you know,</v>

802
00:48:58.210 --> 00:49:02.020
where it was Barack Obama born and the way you've defined science.

803
00:49:02.110 --> 00:49:05.020
I would interpret that to me and it doesn't actually matter where he was born,

804
00:49:05.260 --> 00:49:07.300
that where was born doesn't have an answer.

805
00:49:07.690 --> 00:49:11.740
The only thing that matters is what your bias is or whether it fits your subset

806
00:49:11.741 --> 00:49:12.574
of evidence.

807
00:49:12.700 --> 00:49:17.290
The question of whether where he was really born doesn't really exist anywhere

808
00:49:17.291 --> 00:49:20.680
in this definition,
and that's the reason why I don't buy the definition.

809
00:49:21.070 --> 00:49:25.060
That question has an answer and that answer is external to me and it's external

810
00:49:25.061 --> 00:49:28.720
to my biases.
And it may be true that I have bought this or that bias,

811
00:49:29.020 --> 00:49:33.400
but um,
my biases have only a limited power.

812
00:49:33.401 --> 00:49:38.010
My biases do not change where Barack Obama was born.
That's right there.

813
00:49:38.170 --> 00:49:42.050
That fact is completely independent of my biases.
And so I,

814
00:49:42.180 --> 00:49:46.060
I find this definition of science being complete cause science absolutely does

815
00:49:46.061 --> 00:49:47.700
care about reality.

816
00:49:48.020 --> 00:49:52.040
<v 0>Yeah,
I could do it.
It doesn't necessarily care about reality.</v>

817
00:49:52.041 --> 00:49:56.900
Predicts cares about predictability.
The two can be very coincidence.
Yeah.

818
00:49:57.290 --> 00:49:59.530
So I completed the process.
This,

819
00:49:59.610 --> 00:50:02.690
the aim here is not to define the process science at the time.
Civic method,

820
00:50:02.691 --> 00:50:04.190
which of course I apply in my own loud.

821
00:50:04.880 --> 00:50:08.840
What I'm trying to suggest is that in order to apply that method,

822
00:50:08.841 --> 00:50:12.050
you need to have something that comes first,
right?

823
00:50:12.080 --> 00:50:14.420
You have to have a desire to ask a question.

824
00:50:14.900 --> 00:50:17.930
You have to have the willingness to doubt what you think to be true already.

825
00:50:17.931 --> 00:50:20.720
You have to be willing to doubt your own biases to think,
well,
maybe you,

826
00:50:20.721 --> 00:50:25.310
Barack Obama was actually born here,
right?
You have to have that.

827
00:50:25.340 --> 00:50:27.050
If you're going to do good science,

828
00:50:27.320 --> 00:50:29.630
if you're going to apply a good scientific method,

829
00:50:29.810 --> 00:50:31.850
but you could have designed a greatest experiment.

830
00:50:32.390 --> 00:50:35.660
But if you have a crap question,
who cares,
right?

831
00:50:36.110 --> 00:50:38.330
Because then you find a useless answer.

832
00:50:39.170 --> 00:50:42.590
I want you to come up with a great answer,
but to do that,
you have to ask.

833
00:50:42.591 --> 00:50:46.040
Great question.
I want you to be a great experimentalist,

834
00:50:46.250 --> 00:50:49.430
but you can be the best experimentalist,
but you'll still be a crop scientist,

835
00:50:50.450 --> 00:50:55.310
right?
Because you'll come up with useless answers if you're not willing to ask a

836
00:50:55.311 --> 00:50:58.400
question,
especially a question that challenges your own assumptions.

837
00:50:58.790 --> 00:51:00.030
And that's what science is,

838
00:51:00.230 --> 00:51:03.110
is to be able to challenge your own assumptions of what you think is true.

839
00:51:04.010 --> 00:51:07.090
But to do that,
your brain evolved to take you away from that place.

840
00:51:08.330 --> 00:51:10.100
And one of the only places,

841
00:51:10.250 --> 00:51:14.000
literally an evolution that enables you to challenge your own biases is in the

842
00:51:14.001 --> 00:51:17.870
context of play.
That's the way of being that enables you to do that.

843
00:51:18.260 --> 00:51:22.040
And then you apply the scientific method,
right,
of empiricism,
right?

844
00:51:22.390 --> 00:51:25.690
A control one variable,
et cetera.
But having one control is,

845
00:51:25.700 --> 00:51:28.910
it's like defining an artist painting based on the brush strokes where the

846
00:51:28.911 --> 00:51:31.470
pigment chemistry,
all right?

847
00:51:31.640 --> 00:51:35.180
The mechanism of painting is not what define whether or not it was a good piece

848
00:51:35.181 --> 00:51:37.400
of art is the view.

849
00:51:38.330 --> 00:51:41.660
This is incomplete in the sense that you then apply a scientific method on top

850
00:51:41.661 --> 00:51:42.590
of it.
Absolutely.

851
00:51:43.460 --> 00:51:45.920
And the intention of science is different from the intention of art,

852
00:51:47.010 --> 00:51:47.950
but the initiation,

853
00:51:47.951 --> 00:51:52.880
the desire to go forward as the thing is the argument and what's more the most

854
00:51:52.881 --> 00:51:56.100
successful systems in nature.
Also the ones that play into your daughters.

855
00:51:59.840 --> 00:52:02.000
So the point is you have to adopt this way of being

856
00:52:04.040 --> 00:52:05.840
if you're going to ever explore the world.

857
00:52:05.960 --> 00:52:09.530
Otherwise you'll be stuck in your own biases and your own assumptions.

858
00:52:09.800 --> 00:52:12.290
And you'll continue to live with the idea that Barack Obama

859
00:52:13.850 --> 00:52:17.100
<v 1>was born now and not in the states.
Right?</v>

860
00:52:21.110 --> 00:52:26.110
<v 0>So the third point is that in order to be able to ask these questions to be in a</v>

861
00:52:26.361 --> 00:52:30.830
lab,
for instance,
where questions are a good thing,
right?
You need an ecology.

862
00:52:31.160 --> 00:52:33.620
It's not good enough just to be on your own necessarily.

863
00:52:33.621 --> 00:52:37.100
You need an environment where asking questions is being playful is actually a

864
00:52:37.101 --> 00:52:41.420
positive thing,
right?
Hence the power of the host,
the leader.

865
00:52:41.600 --> 00:52:44.810
And if you ask people what defines good leadership,
you get all kinds of answers,

866
00:52:44.960 --> 00:52:48.320
right?
But the only three there is associated with excessive anyone company,

867
00:52:48.650 --> 00:52:50.540
which is lead by a stakes,
admit,

868
00:52:50.780 --> 00:52:53.840
lead by example and mistakes and see qualities and others,
right?

869
00:52:54.050 --> 00:52:57.260
These are the three that define the success of any one company and the reason is

870
00:52:57.261 --> 00:52:59.690
because they actually create an environment.
Oh,
play.

871
00:53:00.440 --> 00:53:02.540
The first one is lead by example.
It's space that is secure.

872
00:53:02.541 --> 00:53:06.270
You can't ask questions and play outside of space.
That is trust.

873
00:53:06.300 --> 00:53:10.700
This is very well known.
All right?
The second is admit mistakes.

874
00:53:10.701 --> 00:53:14.270
That is space it celebrate on Sunday that mistakes are okay.
Questions are okay,

875
00:53:15.020 --> 00:53:16.690
not answers,
right?

876
00:53:17.510 --> 00:53:20.030
Not to say the answers are not important,

877
00:53:20.031 --> 00:53:23.210
but you have to have a good question first and the third is seek.

878
00:53:23.220 --> 00:53:26.490
Why isn't it as,
that's the space that celebrates,
right?
Again,

879
00:53:26.520 --> 00:53:30.990
three of the parameters that are essential for a quality of play.
Okay,

880
00:53:31.290 --> 00:53:34.860
so we'll finish with two examples of leadership,

881
00:53:35.140 --> 00:53:35.973
<v 1>right?
Here's one</v>

882
00:53:43.790 --> 00:53:44.840
sound

883
00:53:49.620 --> 00:53:50.453
reassuring.

884
00:54:01.490 --> 00:54:02.360
<v 0>Here's the other</v>

885
00:54:02.830 --> 00:54:04.970
<v 1>right notice looks up for reassurance,</v>

886
00:54:11.290 --> 00:54:12.123
<v 0>right?</v>

887
00:54:12.940 --> 00:54:16.000
So the question of course is what kind of leader are you right for we can just

888
00:54:16.001 --> 00:54:19.480
finish with who cares,
right at the point when I show you an illusion,

889
00:54:19.481 --> 00:54:22.130
there is an illusion here.
The senior self c is actually dark,

890
00:54:22.180 --> 00:54:26.440
is the same intensity as the fee that right now you're seeing an illusion,

891
00:54:27.010 --> 00:54:29.920
but as soon as you know that you're seeing the Louis and your brain is holding

892
00:54:29.921 --> 00:54:33.490
two mutually exclusive route is at the same time you're seeing one reality,

893
00:54:33.491 --> 00:54:34.780
but you also know another reality.

894
00:54:34.880 --> 00:54:35.713
<v 1>Yeah,</v>

895
00:54:36.060 --> 00:54:39.030
<v 0>that's an incredibly powerful thing for our brains to be able to hold,</v>

896
00:54:39.031 --> 00:54:43.590
to mute ciscos of ideas at the same time.
That is the basis for imagination.

897
00:54:44.320 --> 00:54:45.153
<v 1>Okay,</v>

898
00:54:45.890 --> 00:54:49.730
<v 0>so this relates ultimately to conflict.</v>

899
00:54:50.540 --> 00:54:54.020
If conflict is the only place where we can actually learn.

900
00:54:54.530 --> 00:54:55.730
And by definition of conflict,

901
00:54:55.760 --> 00:54:58.670
I mean to enter a situation is different from what you assume to be true.

902
00:54:58.910 --> 00:55:01.070
You're in conflict evolution in that sense.

903
00:55:01.190 --> 00:55:03.500
You could argue conceptually as a conflicting process.

904
00:55:03.740 --> 00:55:07.910
That's the only place where we can actually change the problem is we enter

905
00:55:07.911 --> 00:55:11.240
conflict and usually the same way if you and I are in disagreement,

906
00:55:11.660 --> 00:55:13.790
it's as if we're on different ends of the same line.

907
00:55:14.090 --> 00:55:17.270
My aim is to prove that you're wrong and a shift you towards me and your aim is

908
00:55:17.271 --> 00:55:22.271
to do exactly the opposite and that format of conflict we're set up to win but

909
00:55:22.881 --> 00:55:24.260
not necessarily learn.

910
00:55:25.520 --> 00:55:30.080
The question is how does biology do with conflict?
All right,
here's a riddle.

911
00:55:30.081 --> 00:55:34.400
How can you move those two dots closer together without actually shifting the

912
00:55:34.401 --> 00:55:35.600
location of the dock at all

913
00:55:41.360 --> 00:55:44.490
in wards and larger circles,
right?

914
00:55:45.270 --> 00:55:49.920
You increased the space,
increase the dimensionality of the space,
right?

915
00:55:50.220 --> 00:55:53.370
In the case of genetics is called extra dimensional bypass,
right?

916
00:55:53.460 --> 00:55:57.330
You're complexify,
you complexify the system.

917
00:55:57.510 --> 00:55:59.730
So while we might be an opposite ends of the same lines,

918
00:55:59.731 --> 00:56:04.731
we can actually be at same side of a square and now gives you more directions in

919
00:56:04.891 --> 00:56:08.480
which to move.
As you increase the dimensionality space you actually read,

920
00:56:08.481 --> 00:56:10.110
it would be become closer and closer together.

921
00:56:10.950 --> 00:56:14.310
Right now you create the possibility of learning rather than just winning.

922
00:56:14.880 --> 00:56:16.950
And this is how actually nature results conflict.

923
00:56:18.240 --> 00:56:18.720
<v 1>Right?</v>

924
00:56:18.720 --> 00:56:20.520
<v 0>By increasing dimensionality of the space.</v>

925
00:56:21.560 --> 00:56:22.100
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

926
00:56:22.100 --> 00:56:23.980
<v 0>So we'll finish with that idea.
Imagine in order to</v>

927
00:56:23.980 --> 00:56:24.311
<v 1>do that,</v>

928
00:56:24.311 --> 00:56:27.730
you actually have to enter conflict with a question instead of an answer.

929
00:56:28.600 --> 00:56:31.420
And that's the space.
That's the way of being that's required.

930
00:56:31.450 --> 00:56:32.590
In order to do good science,

931
00:56:32.591 --> 00:56:36.880
you enter with a question rather than with my answer.
Okay.

932
00:56:37.630 --> 00:56:42.580
<v 0>So I hope that's useful.
Okay,
so any questions?</v>

933
00:56:45.450 --> 00:56:46.283
<v 1>Can we get,</v>

934
00:56:47.670 --> 00:56:49.410
<v 8>okay,
this feels weird talking on this.</v>

935
00:56:50.430 --> 00:56:54.330
I've read an article from a mathematician that ends up questioning reality and

936
00:56:54.331 --> 00:56:56.620
he says the biggest thing that stuck out to me was,
okay,

937
00:56:58.110 --> 00:57:00.540
neuroscientists are asking the wrong question.

938
00:57:00.780 --> 00:57:03.030
They shouldn't be asking what's happening.
They should be asking,

939
00:57:03.031 --> 00:57:07.890
does the gray matter even exist if we're always constantly perceiving things

940
00:57:07.891 --> 00:57:12.600
incorrectly or shared perception is kind of off.
Does the brain exist?

941
00:57:12.630 --> 00:57:16.560
Does this chair even exist in this reality or are we sharing that and I don't.

942
00:57:16.620 --> 00:57:19.250
I'd like to hear from a neurosciences.
Tell me a little bit about it.
Yeah.

943
00:57:19.880 --> 00:57:23.300
<v 0>The world exists.
The physical world exists,
right?</v>

944
00:57:23.750 --> 00:57:27.020
What we perceive of that world is not the same thing as the world itself.

945
00:57:27.920 --> 00:57:31.490
I'll give you a very simple example.
The demonstrate that this has to be true,

946
00:57:31.960 --> 00:57:36.320
right?
Take light.
Light is a linear spectrum from forest.
Well,

947
00:57:36.321 --> 00:57:39.770
actually it's electromagnetic radiation,
which is a huge spectrum.

948
00:57:39.950 --> 00:57:42.320
We are sensitive to a very small window,

949
00:57:42.321 --> 00:57:46.010
which by definition we call light light is the parts of the region that we're

950
00:57:46.011 --> 00:57:50.060
sensitive to.
40% of [inaudible].
It's a linear spectrum,
right?

951
00:57:50.750 --> 00:57:52.970
We perceive that as a circle.

952
00:57:53.480 --> 00:57:57.770
We perceive the short wavelengths to be blue and the long way breaks to be red.

953
00:57:58.250 --> 00:57:58.850
Okay.

954
00:57:58.850 --> 00:58:02.600
Which means that perceptually they appear more similar to each other than they

955
00:58:02.601 --> 00:58:04.220
do to green,
which is in the middle.

956
00:58:04.280 --> 00:58:06.140
Even though they're physically closer to green,

957
00:58:07.020 --> 00:58:08.540
are perceptually more similar to each other.

958
00:58:08.541 --> 00:58:13.220
It's a bit like one culo feeling a lot like a thousand kilos but very different

959
00:58:13.221 --> 00:58:17.420
from 500 kilos.
So even there in our perception of color,

960
00:58:17.540 --> 00:58:22.070
we don't do an isomorphic representation of light itself light.
Uh,

961
00:58:22.071 --> 00:58:25.760
our perception of lights is also color.
It has four categories.
Red,
green,

962
00:58:25.761 --> 00:58:30.761
blue and yellow spectrum are uniformly and continuously district changing.

963
00:58:31.670 --> 00:58:34.770
There's nothing categorical about life and you have to,

964
00:58:34.771 --> 00:58:37.910
it was perceptually useful to see light in terms of four categories,

965
00:58:38.630 --> 00:58:42.440
possibly because of the four color map problem cartography where you need four

966
00:58:42.441 --> 00:58:43.040
colors,

967
00:58:43.040 --> 00:58:46.740
a minimum of four colors to color any map in order to make sure to services

968
00:58:46.760 --> 00:58:50.060
don't actually have the same color,
Juha joining first African club.

969
00:58:50.390 --> 00:58:53.180
So it could be useful that that's why we see four categories of color,

970
00:58:53.660 --> 00:58:58.430
but it has nothing to do with category,
the category nature of spectrum.

971
00:58:59.240 --> 00:59:03.050
So spectrum exists,
it's just that we don't represent them as spectrum.

972
00:59:03.860 --> 00:59:06.950
We represent them in a way that was useful,
not in the way that it was accurate.

973
00:59:08.220 --> 00:59:09.053
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

974
00:59:14.840 --> 00:59:18.710
<v 8>I was just wondering whether it has to do with genetics,</v>

975
00:59:18.860 --> 00:59:21.980
but help people stress out about,
so I

976
00:59:21.980 --> 00:59:26.660
<v 9>don't get nauseous on the boats in some people.
Some people do.
The question is,</v>

977
00:59:27.020 --> 00:59:32.020
does imply that I'm more tolerant to uncertainty and hence better at doing open

978
00:59:32.930 --> 00:59:34.560
questions and doing science then.

979
00:59:35.440 --> 00:59:37.870
<v 0>Cool.
Yeah,
so it's a very good question.</v>

980
00:59:37.900 --> 00:59:41.860
I think it is true that some people actually have more tolerance for uncertainty

981
00:59:41.870 --> 00:59:45.880
about others,
and it's also a really interesting question why they might be,

982
00:59:45.881 --> 00:59:50.590
so now it could be genetic,
but also if you think about parenting,

983
00:59:51.090 --> 00:59:52.090
so I have three kids.

984
00:59:53.110 --> 00:59:57.640
My role in some sense is to create the certainty that enables them to step into

985
00:59:57.641 --> 01:00:00.450
uncertainty.
Because you can step into a certain essence.

986
01:00:00.480 --> 01:00:04.670
You're stepping from someplace,
right?
You can't play outside of space.

987
01:00:04.671 --> 01:00:08.590
It's trusted.
So people who often can tolerate uncertainty,

988
01:00:08.591 --> 01:00:11.560
it's because they have something very certain that counterbalances it.

989
01:00:13.580 --> 01:00:15.830
Okay.
And so a lot of education,
a lot of weight.

990
01:00:15.860 --> 01:00:19.670
It's about trying to treat that certainty.
Right?
It could be through love,

991
01:00:19.671 --> 01:00:23.180
for instance,
that enables a child in this case,
to feel very warranted,

992
01:00:23.390 --> 01:00:27.530
that enables them to now step into an a and be courageous and explorer.

993
01:00:28.150 --> 01:00:31.640
But often kids that don't have that find it very difficult to be an uncertainty

994
01:00:32.150 --> 01:00:34.160
because so much of their life is uncertain.

995
01:00:35.000 --> 01:00:37.070
They're actually looking for certainly not uncertainty.

996
01:00:38.950 --> 01:00:41.480
So I don't know if it's genetic.
There seems impossible.

997
01:00:41.481 --> 01:00:45.250
It'd be a genetic component,
but there definitely is a difference in people,

998
01:00:45.850 --> 01:00:48.730
right?
But the idea here is that we can actually help people,

999
01:00:48.820 --> 01:00:52.480
other people step into uncertainty by helping to create any college that enables

1000
01:00:52.481 --> 01:00:53.314
them to do so.

1001
01:00:56.840 --> 01:00:58.080
<v 9>Let's get a round of applause for both.</v>

1002
01:01:00.120 --> 01:01:01.080
<v 0>Thanks for coming in.</v>
