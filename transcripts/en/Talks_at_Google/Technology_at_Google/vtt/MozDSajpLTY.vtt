1
00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:09.690
Thank you so much tie.
It's a great pleasure for me to come here to Google,

2
00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:14.040
but also a special privilege to be introduced by dying.
I have a friend,

3
00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:17.100
but also we have been constantly exchanging ideas.

4
00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:19.980
And today I like to talk to you,
talk to you.

5
00:00:19.981 --> 00:00:24.981
What about I view as the three frontiers of information technology for the

6
00:00:25.381 --> 00:00:29.160
future of hunting,
computing,
artificial intelligence and blockchain,

7
00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:33.900
but especially also the possible symbiosis among these three major trends.

8
00:00:34.080 --> 00:00:37.830
I think in these days in the world,
there are many experts in each one of those,

9
00:00:38.050 --> 00:00:39.240
uh,
subjects.

10
00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:44.100
But I think the really exciting opportunity is possibly the conference or the

11
00:00:44.101 --> 00:00:49.101
symbiosis among these three major trends of the future of the information

12
00:00:49.561 --> 00:00:50.394
technology.

13
00:00:50.580 --> 00:00:54.660
They may start with a story of a recent scientific discovery,

14
00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:57.120
a recent discovery,
but he had a long history.

15
00:00:57.720 --> 00:01:02.720
So a lot of great discoveries in science also relates to some deep changes in

16
00:01:03.751 --> 00:01:08.700
philosophy.
We seem to live in a world of opposites,
a world of dualism.

17
00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:12.390
We have,
whenever we have positive numbers,
we have negative numbers.

18
00:01:12.391 --> 00:01:15.540
When we'll have credits,
were have deaths,
we have yin and Yang.

19
00:01:15.541 --> 00:01:20.400
Good and evil angels and demons.
But in the natural world,

20
00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:22.680
there's also a counterpart to these,
uh,

21
00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:27.510
philosophy of the opposites or the duality.
So in 1928,

22
00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:32.430
the great,
perhaps a one of the greatest to theoretical physicist of all time,

23
00:01:32.730 --> 00:01:37.730
Paul Dirac was trying to unify a Einstein's theory of special relativity with

24
00:01:38.611 --> 00:01:41.370
quantum mechanics.
In the process of doing so,

25
00:01:41.371 --> 00:01:44.100
he was doing as a mathematical derivations.

26
00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:47.730
He had to encounter a operation of square root.

27
00:01:48.150 --> 00:01:51.420
And then he remembered from his high school days there,

28
00:01:51.421 --> 00:01:55.470
the square root of nine is not just three,
because three times three is nine,

29
00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:59.010
but also minus to be made because minus three times a minus three,

30
00:01:59.011 --> 00:02:01.540
it's also nine.
So whenever you take a route,

31
00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:06.540
you have to take both the positive and the negative route at that time was very

32
00:02:06.541 --> 00:02:10.290
perplexing.
What that negative route meant.
And He,
uh,

33
00:02:10.291 --> 00:02:13.080
actually one brilliant stroke of genius.

34
00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:16.140
He predicted that for every matter in the world,

35
00:02:16.141 --> 00:02:18.360
that's the opposite matter or the antiemetic.

36
00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:22.930
And to when you visit Westminster Abbey,
you can try to find a pack,

37
00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:27.780
a commemorating the famous at Iraq equation.
And teeing,
uh,

38
00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:28.860
2012,

39
00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:33.510
one of the most humbling experience in my life is to receive the poor rock and

40
00:02:33.511 --> 00:02:37.740
metal.
So just I said,
whenever you take the square root two,

41
00:02:37.741 --> 00:02:40.510
you have the positive branch and the negative branch.
And uh,

42
00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:45.590
he brilliantly interpreted the mega negative branch to be a universal law of

43
00:02:46.021 --> 00:02:49.290
nature there too.
For every particle there seemed the universe,

44
00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:53.370
there's also a antiparticle except at a time,
uh,

45
00:02:53.550 --> 00:02:56.930
everybody viewed this as a beautiful,
uh,
equation,
but to,

46
00:02:56.940 --> 00:03:01.630
except at the time of 1928 where he made these a prediction,

47
00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:04.570
there was simply no Animoto.
So for example,

48
00:03:04.571 --> 00:03:08.050
the anti matter of the electron will be something that has a positive charge,

49
00:03:08.051 --> 00:03:11.980
but at the same mess,
the Proton has the opposite charge to the electron,

50
00:03:12.130 --> 00:03:17.020
but has 2000 times more dms as the ilecture.
So nobody believed teams.

51
00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:21.520
Uh,
then,
you know what he said?
He said,
my equation is so beautiful,

52
00:03:21.820 --> 00:03:25.780
you guys simply just go look for it.
And to people did,

53
00:03:25.830 --> 00:03:30.280
and he was lucky.
And five years later in cosmic ray radiation,

54
00:03:30.550 --> 00:03:33.190
it's very hard to naturally produce that on earth.

55
00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:36.820
But in the cosmic ray radiation,
people are discovered antiemetic,

56
00:03:36.850 --> 00:03:37.860
namely the positron,

57
00:03:38.050 --> 00:03:42.250
which has exactly the same mass but the opposite charge of the lecture.

58
00:03:42.580 --> 00:03:47.410
So I think this is the one of the greatest prediction of all humanity.

59
00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:52.750
Something conceived of beauty also turn out to be true today.

60
00:03:52.751 --> 00:03:55.900
We actually use these anti-matter in medical devices,

61
00:03:56.050 --> 00:03:59.080
a famous medical imaging technique called pet scan,

62
00:03:59.230 --> 00:04:03.940
positron emission tomography.
And it was actually based on these antiparticle,

63
00:04:04.180 --> 00:04:08.830
the,
uh,
posit Trump.
It also captured the imagination of Hollywood.

64
00:04:08.980 --> 00:04:13.060
So there's a famous novel and the movie of Davinci Code.

65
00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:15.850
Many of you have read a book and saw the movie,

66
00:04:16.060 --> 00:04:20.520
but there's also a sequel to it called angels and demons.
Also played by a,

67
00:04:20.530 --> 00:04:24.570
also a book by Dan Prompt.
I also play by Tom Hanks.
Uh,

68
00:04:24.640 --> 00:04:28.580
basically the novel depicts the epical epic struggle between,

69
00:04:28.690 --> 00:04:30.130
between angels and demons,

70
00:04:30.310 --> 00:04:34.360
cumulating in the and the hill Asian of particles and antiparticles.

71
00:04:34.570 --> 00:04:36.520
So actually it's the highest,
uh,

72
00:04:36.550 --> 00:04:41.080
information density one can possibly achieve anywhere in the universe.

73
00:04:41.400 --> 00:04:43.870
If you have anti-matter and with matter,

74
00:04:43.990 --> 00:04:48.430
the energy they release a is the most powerful there can ever be.

75
00:04:48.910 --> 00:04:53.680
But it's also a fun analogy.
Just us.
We have Angio,
we have demon.

76
00:04:53.830 --> 00:04:58.080
Whenever will have positive particle,
we have the opposite,
the antiparticle,

77
00:04:59.530 --> 00:05:03.430
but human curiosity didn't stop there.
So after the rocks,

78
00:05:03.431 --> 00:05:08.190
a prediction is viewed as one of the,
the upgraders,
the prediction of wartime.

79
00:05:08.500 --> 00:05:11.560
Uh,
curiosity didn't stop there.
So there was a,

80
00:05:11.590 --> 00:05:16.330
another great theoretical physicist,
but somewhat elusive,
uh,

81
00:05:16.630 --> 00:05:20.050
during his time.
Uh,
my name is Tori,
my Iran,

82
00:05:20.470 --> 00:05:22.000
and he asked the curious question,

83
00:05:22.001 --> 00:05:24.370
could that be matter which denim hip and he matter,

84
00:05:24.400 --> 00:05:29.400
or a particle which is its own anti particle or a particle which would not have

85
00:05:29.741 --> 00:05:33.850
its own,
uh,
we're not have a antiparticle is its own anti particle.

86
00:05:33.880 --> 00:05:35.050
Is that possible?

87
00:05:35.470 --> 00:05:39.040
So he asked this question and he also wrote down a beautiful equation,

88
00:05:39.420 --> 00:05:42.590
which described it,
but this time he was not so lucky.

89
00:05:42.930 --> 00:05:46.160
Nobody believed him and nobody found it.
So,
uh,

90
00:05:46.540 --> 00:05:50.320
he actually got very disappointed about that.

91
00:05:50.590 --> 00:05:54.220
So ever since then it became a mystery in fundamental science.

92
00:05:54.221 --> 00:05:59.221
So we have a in fundamental science and most wanted list for example at the list

93
00:06:00.531 --> 00:06:04.340
included what is called a dot particle or Hicks Bozon.

94
00:06:04.610 --> 00:06:06.440
But in 2012,
uh,

95
00:06:06.441 --> 00:06:10.220
it was discovered in soon in the laboratory in Geneva.

96
00:06:10.760 --> 00:06:13.160
There's also the gravitational wave,
uh,

97
00:06:13.161 --> 00:06:15.800
Einstein was less likely then to rock the rock.

98
00:06:15.920 --> 00:06:20.390
Only his prediction only took five years for it to be experimentally confirmed.

99
00:06:20.660 --> 00:06:24.890
But Einstein's prediction of gravitational wave more than 100 year,

100
00:06:25.420 --> 00:06:30.140
only two years ago it was discovered was an Einstein predicted or 100 years ago.

101
00:06:30.410 --> 00:06:32.130
So there's such a list and to,

102
00:06:32.330 --> 00:06:34.820
and to also something called the dark matter particle,

103
00:06:34.940 --> 00:06:36.260
which we're still trying to find,

104
00:06:36.560 --> 00:06:41.560
but also very much on the top of the list is this a very interesting concept of

105
00:06:42.590 --> 00:06:43.760
Mirena Afirma,

106
00:06:43.910 --> 00:06:47.900
which is a particle which does not have anti particle or is its own anti

107
00:06:47.901 --> 00:06:51.830
particle,
but it's more mysterious maybe among all those,
uh,

108
00:06:51.890 --> 00:06:53.300
on the most wanted list.

109
00:06:53.350 --> 00:06:57.380
And maybe my runner for me is most mysterious because not only am I a runner,

110
00:06:57.460 --> 00:06:59.990
Philomena has not been found.
And like I said,

111
00:07:00.020 --> 00:07:04.890
he was very disappointed when nobody believed in his prediction and to,

112
00:07:04.891 --> 00:07:09.890
he was Italian and he,
uh,
boarded a ferry from Palermo,

113
00:07:09.980 --> 00:07:13.040
uh,
to,
uh,
from,
uh,
Naples to polemical,

114
00:07:13.100 --> 00:07:17.060
but he never reappeared from that very right.
So you become a deep,

115
00:07:17.061 --> 00:07:21.890
deep mystery and DCA is exactly the 80 year of his disappearance.

116
00:07:22.130 --> 00:07:26.690
But we also have some good news to report even though he himself was never
found.

117
00:07:26.870 --> 00:07:28.550
His particle now has been found.

118
00:07:28.880 --> 00:07:33.800
And that's the highlight of my talk today.
So,
uh,
so then,
uh,

119
00:07:33.830 --> 00:07:35.750
because he's in pre down the equation,

120
00:07:35.751 --> 00:07:40.010
but he didn't tell people where to find it.
So that's why it took 80 years.

121
00:07:40.110 --> 00:07:42.260
And so nobody knew where to find them.

122
00:07:42.740 --> 00:07:47.740
But so my theory group has Stanford predicted where and how to find these

123
00:07:48.831 --> 00:07:52.410
mysterious particle and seeing,
uh,
uh,
during,
uh,

124
00:07:52.560 --> 00:07:55.890
the period of 2010 and 2015,
uh,

125
00:07:55.910 --> 00:07:59.660
or theory group wrote three theoretical papers.
First one,

126
00:07:59.690 --> 00:08:04.040
exactly to predict where actually quite surprisingly,

127
00:08:04.041 --> 00:08:08.330
it's not too,
uh,
for these particles to be found in some huge accelerators.

128
00:08:08.510 --> 00:08:11.240
But you could be in a tabletop kind of experiment,

129
00:08:11.420 --> 00:08:14.750
very much like a semiconductor device.
People will usually use.

130
00:08:14.960 --> 00:08:17.340
So it's a material called the topological insulator.

131
00:08:17.360 --> 00:08:21.920
Diane already mentioned introduction,
something I discovered 10 years ago,

132
00:08:22.250 --> 00:08:25.370
but they putting into it some magnetic dopants.

133
00:08:25.500 --> 00:08:29.030
So the topological insulators can be something that business terror,
right?

134
00:08:29.330 --> 00:08:33.320
And they,
you can putting some magnetic dopants,
uh,
which could be chromium.

135
00:08:33.630 --> 00:08:36.320
And then on top of it you apply a superconductor.

136
00:08:36.350 --> 00:08:40.950
So we predict that in this system you can find these mysterious my runner from

137
00:08:40.970 --> 00:08:45.380
yet.
But that's not good enough.
Not only you have to predict where to find it,

138
00:08:45.410 --> 00:08:48.580
but to what to measure in order to find it.
And they are,

139
00:08:48.581 --> 00:08:51.500
I think a common sense can even guide us.

140
00:08:51.680 --> 00:08:55.470
So somehow the regular particle,
it's like two sides of coin.

141
00:08:55.710 --> 00:08:58.710
Whenever you have the upside,
you have the downside.
When they bill,

142
00:08:58.711 --> 00:09:02.970
you have deposited particle,
you'll have to antiparticle associated was it.

143
00:09:03.320 --> 00:09:07.260
But East Myranda particle is only,
uh,
only one site.

144
00:09:07.290 --> 00:09:11.430
It is so many a particle,
but no antiparticle.
So in some vague sense,

145
00:09:11.520 --> 00:09:15.720
it is half of a user particle.
So this concept of a half will be very,

146
00:09:15.721 --> 00:09:19.680
very important.
In the later part of my talk about quantum computers.

147
00:09:19.890 --> 00:09:24.180
So somehow these Myranda particle is half of a regular particle.
So,

148
00:09:24.181 --> 00:09:27.330
but regular particle has some phenomena of their conductance,

149
00:09:27.360 --> 00:09:32.190
like the resistance or conductance we usually measure can be context in units of

150
00:09:32.191 --> 00:09:34.560
zero,
one,
two,
three and so on.

151
00:09:34.800 --> 00:09:38.820
So they behave like introduce in a conversation a step.

152
00:09:39.120 --> 00:09:44.120
So w we once had a Eureka moment that if the Mirena particle is in some sense

153
00:09:46.261 --> 00:09:47.910
half of a regular particle,

154
00:09:48.090 --> 00:09:51.960
then they should display some plateau at half integer steps,

155
00:09:52.110 --> 00:09:54.900
namely at one half,
three half and so on and so forth.

156
00:09:55.140 --> 00:10:00.110
So that became or prediction that in this system you can experimentally comes

157
00:10:00.111 --> 00:10:05.111
trapped by what you measure is this one half step in last year in the close

158
00:10:05.671 --> 00:10:09.300
collaboration with experimental colleagues at Ucla,

159
00:10:09.330 --> 00:10:11.310
Uc Davis and UC Irvine.

160
00:10:11.520 --> 00:10:16.380
So they exactly a constructed this system as we theoretically proposed and they

161
00:10:16.381 --> 00:10:20.640
performed the measurement exactly according to our theoretical prediction.

162
00:10:20.940 --> 00:10:25.020
And Lo and behold,
uh,
besides,
uh,
these integer step at one,

163
00:10:25.200 --> 00:10:28.710
something a zero or UC,
there's a step at one half.

164
00:10:29.040 --> 00:10:31.770
And this one half is a crucial idea that,
uh,

165
00:10:31.820 --> 00:10:35.670
my Reiner particle being half of a regular particle,
it should display,

166
00:10:35.671 --> 00:10:38.970
whereas regular particle display,
integer,
quantize step,

167
00:10:39.180 --> 00:10:42.330
my runner portico should give you half quantized step.

168
00:10:42.660 --> 00:10:47.660
So daddy is really the smoking gun and it was celebrated last year with the

169
00:10:48.181 --> 00:10:53.040
publication in the Science magazine.
So in that very exciting moment,

170
00:10:53.070 --> 00:10:58.070
I remember the famous and novel and a famous movie I saw about angels and

171
00:10:58.501 --> 00:10:59.334
demons.

172
00:10:59.340 --> 00:11:04.340
I procaine that it's a safe way discovered a paradise with only Angelus and no

173
00:11:04.801 --> 00:11:08.010
demons.
So I call these the Injil particle.

174
00:11:09.450 --> 00:11:12.090
So now what is,
is good for.
So today

175
00:11:15.510 --> 00:11:19.800
or classical computers are already very,
very powerful,

176
00:11:20.220 --> 00:11:24.000
but they are good at doing some things and not good at doing some other things.

177
00:11:24.300 --> 00:11:28.410
So if I give you a very two very large numbers and to ask the computer to

178
00:11:28.411 --> 00:11:32.220
multiply,
they do this in a split second Google couch.

179
00:11:32.490 --> 00:11:35.470
You were maybe a Nano Nano second.
Uh,

180
00:11:35.550 --> 00:11:39.260
but if you give a number and to ask the computer with a dead number,

181
00:11:39.270 --> 00:11:43.500
factorized this into two other numbers,
giving the example,
for example,

182
00:11:43.501 --> 00:11:46.230
15 is equal to three times five,

183
00:11:46.530 --> 00:11:50.280
but 11 cannot be factorized as a product of two numbers.

184
00:11:50.340 --> 00:11:53.140
The only thing you can do is to say 11 is one time,

185
00:11:53.141 --> 00:11:57.370
say 11 which doesn't mean very much.
But then if I gave me a very,

186
00:11:57.371 --> 00:12:01.720
very large number,
and if you want to ask whether the debt very large number of,

187
00:12:02.430 --> 00:12:07.390
uh,
can be expressed just like 15 as the product of two other numbers,

188
00:12:07.510 --> 00:12:12.370
or it is more like 11,
which cannot be expressed as a product to a numbers,

189
00:12:12.550 --> 00:12:15.730
the computer and a classical computer will have a very,

190
00:12:15.731 --> 00:12:17.800
very hard time to answer these questions.

191
00:12:18.190 --> 00:12:21.460
The only way it can do is to do an exhaustive search.

192
00:12:21.490 --> 00:12:25.480
It tries to divide these very large number by first by two,
then by three,

193
00:12:25.481 --> 00:12:30.400
them a five by seven and so on and so forth.
And then it takes forever to,
to,

194
00:12:30.401 --> 00:12:33.930
to,
uh,
to do this exhaustive search.
So when you literally,

195
00:12:33.950 --> 00:12:38.020
you think about maybe all of the most important computational provenance,

196
00:12:38.230 --> 00:12:42.610
what we were like a computer to do with Google cloud,
with all the data.

197
00:12:42.760 --> 00:12:46.060
What we would like to do is to find some optimal solutions of something.

198
00:12:46.480 --> 00:12:48.190
So when we tried to find optimal solution,

199
00:12:48.191 --> 00:12:52.390
we basically have to enumerate all possibilities computer,
all of them.

200
00:12:52.391 --> 00:12:56.290
Maybe there's some function optimizing function associated with it,

201
00:12:56.500 --> 00:13:00.910
and you try to find maybe the least path or biggest profit or something like

202
00:13:00.911 --> 00:13:05.080
that.
But do you also have to do an exhaustive search and dead takes very,

203
00:13:05.081 --> 00:13:09.190
very long time.
So that's why computer has a lot to advance.

204
00:13:09.850 --> 00:13:11.770
But then enter the quantum world.

205
00:13:11.860 --> 00:13:14.530
What is the mysterious world of the punctum world?

206
00:13:17.140 --> 00:13:22.140
So if I have two slits and I use a classical [inaudible] and to randomly shoot

207
00:13:22.990 --> 00:13:24.220
through these two slits,

208
00:13:24.490 --> 00:13:28.600
then obviously a bullet either at one given time goes through the right or it

209
00:13:28.601 --> 00:13:32.610
goes through the left and on the back of your two will see two blops,

210
00:13:32.790 --> 00:13:37.090
one coming funded,
right?
And the other coming kind of left,
but not.

211
00:13:37.091 --> 00:13:41.320
So if you try to shoot a elementary particles through the double slits,

212
00:13:41.860 --> 00:13:42.950
so somehow,
uh,

213
00:13:42.951 --> 00:13:47.250
on the background so you don't see two blobs associated with the right or one

214
00:13:47.260 --> 00:13:51.280
associated with the left,
you actually observed rather intricate,
uh,

215
00:13:51.281 --> 00:13:52.900
interference pattern.

216
00:13:53.320 --> 00:13:58.320
And that pattern can only be explained if the particle went through double slits

217
00:13:58.450 --> 00:14:03.450
at exactly the same time it went through both the right and the left at exactly

218
00:14:03.461 --> 00:14:07.810
the same time.
If it didn't do so.
And if you knew which way it went,

219
00:14:08.020 --> 00:14:11.560
it wouldn't need to these intricate interference pattern.

220
00:14:12.160 --> 00:14:14.410
So somehow the quantum worlds,

221
00:14:14.710 --> 00:14:18.580
the mysterious quantum world is parallel at one given time.

222
00:14:18.700 --> 00:14:23.590
A particle is both going through the right and going through the left and then

223
00:14:23.770 --> 00:14:27.730
people somehow started thinking there to this very difficult problem.

224
00:14:27.760 --> 00:14:31.240
That computer classical computer has a very difficult time to solve.

225
00:14:31.480 --> 00:14:33.760
Namely has to go through cereal knee.

226
00:14:33.770 --> 00:14:36.520
It's a exhaustive search of all possibility.

227
00:14:36.790 --> 00:14:41.350
Maybe it can be done by a quantum computer,
which is intrinsically parallel.

228
00:14:41.620 --> 00:14:45.760
So basically then it can search through all these possibilities exactly at the

229
00:14:45.761 --> 00:14:50.050
same time and give you one result in one step of computation.

230
00:14:50.500 --> 00:14:55.460
So deadwood truly be wonderful and we'll increase the computational power in

231
00:14:55.461 --> 00:14:58.070
such a tremendous way.
So,

232
00:14:58.071 --> 00:15:01.490
but in order to have constructed such a quantum computer,

233
00:15:01.491 --> 00:15:04.760
you first need to have the basic elementary unit,

234
00:15:04.880 --> 00:15:07.970
which will be called a punctum bits or cubits.

235
00:15:08.390 --> 00:15:13.160
So our classic Corbett as you have on your classical computer,
Eh,
one bit,

236
00:15:13.161 --> 00:15:14.810
it's either zero or one,

237
00:15:15.320 --> 00:15:18.920
but just like a quantum mechanical particle can go through a double slits at the

238
00:15:18.921 --> 00:15:19.754
same time.

239
00:15:19.910 --> 00:15:24.910
A quantum bit accubid somehow it's a linear super position between zero and one.

240
00:15:25.790 --> 00:15:28.820
It's neither exactly zero,
no,
exactly one.

241
00:15:28.821 --> 00:15:33.420
Somehow it lives in this mysterious superposition,
uh,
state,
uh,

242
00:15:33.440 --> 00:15:38.270
between zero and one.
So in order to do a quantum computer unit necessary,

243
00:15:38.271 --> 00:15:42.050
have to construct such a elementary cubit,
a quantum bit,

244
00:15:42.740 --> 00:15:46.040
but to be in quantum mechanical is also very,
very fragile.

245
00:15:46.310 --> 00:15:47.480
In the classical world,

246
00:15:47.481 --> 00:15:51.350
if you are very curious to see why is it really zero is a really one,

247
00:15:51.380 --> 00:15:52.340
you tried to observe it,

248
00:15:52.520 --> 00:15:57.520
they immediately crash to zero one and you lose this mysterious content concept.

249
00:15:58.190 --> 00:15:58.911
So therefore,

250
00:15:58.911 --> 00:16:03.911
in all the most of the approaches that has been proposed to construct a quantum

251
00:16:04.131 --> 00:16:09.020
computer,
uh,
it's,
uh,
has a lot and lots of errors.
These cubit is very,

252
00:16:09.021 --> 00:16:11.580
very fragile and very unstable and uh,

253
00:16:11.600 --> 00:16:14.930
it's very easily collapsed into a classical a cubit.

254
00:16:15.170 --> 00:16:19.790
So therefore it's a,
it's a daunting number there to for wine,

255
00:16:19.791 --> 00:16:21.350
useful logical cubit,

256
00:16:21.560 --> 00:16:26.560
you have to use 10 to even perhaps 100 error correcting bit to correct,

257
00:16:28.010 --> 00:16:32.240
uh,
one used for cubit.
And that obviously is very,
very,

258
00:16:32.241 --> 00:16:33.590
very difficult to scale.

259
00:16:33.770 --> 00:16:38.300
And that's why we don't yet have a truly functional quantum computer,
uh,

260
00:16:38.301 --> 00:16:40.970
yet,
uh,
which can factories are very big number.

261
00:16:41.810 --> 00:16:44.810
Now enter my a scientific discovery.

262
00:16:44.811 --> 00:16:49.490
So we discovered this mysterious but very interesting angel particle,

263
00:16:49.610 --> 00:16:54.470
which is half of a regular particle.
So then,
uh,
so it's a little bit,

264
00:16:54.471 --> 00:16:56.990
uh,
complicated scientific diagram,

265
00:16:57.200 --> 00:17:01.940
but somehow when you enter in with one cubit,
which is a regular particle,

266
00:17:02.150 --> 00:17:07.150
it can be immediately split into two of these Maiorana thermia or this angel

267
00:17:07.730 --> 00:17:10.580
particles.
So then each,
uh,
being half,

268
00:17:10.670 --> 00:17:14.240
so one cubit you already think is the minimal thing that you can have,

269
00:17:14.540 --> 00:17:18.140
but one cubit is not stored in to Andrew particles.

270
00:17:18.380 --> 00:17:22.400
So just like one cubit entering here is partially start here and partially

271
00:17:22.401 --> 00:17:26.300
stopped there.
Then if you have local perturbation,

272
00:17:26.390 --> 00:17:31.390
it's very hard for local perturbation to destroy the global.

273
00:17:31.850 --> 00:17:34.910
These two NGO particles together function as one cubit.

274
00:17:35.120 --> 00:17:37.820
So it's very hard for local perturbation,

275
00:17:37.850 --> 00:17:41.270
just destroyed this cubit and therefore it's a very,

276
00:17:41.271 --> 00:17:46.070
very robust way of doing computation.
In fact,
in this experiment measurement,

277
00:17:46.220 --> 00:17:50.100
what is happening is that this NGO particles that we see each other.

278
00:17:50.430 --> 00:17:53.790
So if you have some lines,
and if you tried to Brayden,

279
00:17:54.090 --> 00:17:58.350
that is kind of a digital operation.
If you either braided or you didn't.

280
00:17:58.620 --> 00:18:01.770
Whereas in order most other approaches to quantum computing,

281
00:18:01.771 --> 00:18:04.110
it's almost an analog computation.

282
00:18:04.390 --> 00:18:06.990
You can make very easily make little errors.

283
00:18:07.200 --> 00:18:11.790
But if you do what is called a topper logical operation of breeding,
then

284
00:18:13.410 --> 00:18:17.670
then it's actually a very,
very robust,
so you might approach one.

285
00:18:17.670 --> 00:18:21.600
Cubit is just one cubit.
You don't need error correcting cubits.

286
00:18:21.960 --> 00:18:26.130
So this is a still,
uh,
after our discovery,
it's a still kind of a new approach.

287
00:18:26.160 --> 00:18:29.880
So it's coming up,
but compared to other approaches,

288
00:18:30.090 --> 00:18:33.750
which may already have many,
many cubits,
but a lot of them are serving as error,

289
00:18:33.751 --> 00:18:35.940
correcting cubits to one useful cubit.

290
00:18:36.240 --> 00:18:39.450
I believe our approach work eventually scale up much,

291
00:18:39.451 --> 00:18:41.590
much faster because it's one to one.

292
00:18:42.780 --> 00:18:46.590
So this is the first part of my talk about quantum computer.

293
00:18:47.070 --> 00:18:50.250
But now let me switch to the second part of my talk,

294
00:18:50.430 --> 00:18:55.380
which is about artificial intelligence.
When we look at the human history,

295
00:18:55.740 --> 00:19:00.690
evs or it has a long,
uh,
kind of,
uh,

296
00:19:00.750 --> 00:19:05.340
our earth.
And it took her a very long time for the most intelligent species,
uh,

297
00:19:05.370 --> 00:19:06.550
to develop,
uh,

298
00:19:06.551 --> 00:19:10.530
on earth and to took her maybe 3 million years of evolution.

299
00:19:10.740 --> 00:19:15.570
But finally we became the dominating as species.
But now we actually faced with,

300
00:19:15.571 --> 00:19:18.580
so our challenge may be a more intelligent species name.

301
00:19:18.581 --> 00:19:21.180
The Ai could be some emerging,

302
00:19:21.660 --> 00:19:24.660
but AI has been developing maybe since the 60s.

303
00:19:24.690 --> 00:19:27.680
So why we suddenly have this,
uh,
uh,

304
00:19:27.720 --> 00:19:31.890
such rapid increase in the progress of Ai.

305
00:19:32.220 --> 00:19:32.970
So it's amazing.

306
00:19:32.970 --> 00:19:37.800
Basically due to the conference of three major trends in computation

307
00:19:40.470 --> 00:19:43.050
and one is the Morse law.
So the most law,

308
00:19:43.051 --> 00:19:47.840
basically it's about computational power.
So it is,
uh,
a [inaudible],

309
00:19:47.910 --> 00:19:48.270
uh,

310
00:19:48.270 --> 00:19:52.620
the computational power doubles every 18 months according to the progress of the

311
00:19:52.621 --> 00:19:57.450
most law.
So now most law is the facing some challenging,
that's the bad news.

312
00:19:57.630 --> 00:19:59.320
But the good news is there too.

313
00:19:59.360 --> 00:20:04.360
Maybe we'll have something so much more powerful when I then most law predicts,

314
00:20:04.950 --> 00:20:05.340
namely,

315
00:20:05.340 --> 00:20:10.020
we have most law has been a quantitative incremental increase even though it's

316
00:20:10.021 --> 00:20:10.860
very,
very fast.

317
00:20:11.250 --> 00:20:16.250
But quantum computer can be one content jump in the computation of power because

318
00:20:16.651 --> 00:20:20.760
of this massive parallelism associated with quantum computing.

319
00:20:21.030 --> 00:20:24.960
So on the horizon where he see both in the,
in terms of computational power,

320
00:20:25.110 --> 00:20:29.220
we see those challenges to the classical most law as the device gets smaller and

321
00:20:29.221 --> 00:20:33.420
smaller.
But we also see tremendous hope.
Maybe quantum computer can,

322
00:20:33.421 --> 00:20:37.360
can arrive at a scene and to when you try to search,
uh,

323
00:20:37.390 --> 00:20:39.540
among a optimization problem,

324
00:20:39.690 --> 00:20:44.690
you can do one search for one rather than an exhaustive search in a serial

325
00:20:45.090 --> 00:20:45.923
fashion.

326
00:20:46.230 --> 00:20:51.230
So this is something on the horizon that could really a fundamentally be a game

327
00:20:51.341 --> 00:20:52.174
changer.

328
00:20:52.210 --> 00:20:56.950
But the other reason why artificial intelligence today is exploding is because

329
00:20:56.951 --> 00:20:59.800
it was to arrival off the Internet and the Internet of things.

330
00:20:59.920 --> 00:21:02.440
You provided a massive amounts of data

331
00:21:04.570 --> 00:21:07.990
and machines need to learn and they learn only from epic data.

332
00:21:08.710 --> 00:21:13.000
And the other is the rapid progress of the Ai Algorithm.

333
00:21:13.090 --> 00:21:17.440
And to these,
uh,
use also one of the main reason,
for example,

334
00:21:17.441 --> 00:21:21.460
the deep neural nets,
which is providing the main,
uh,

335
00:21:21.490 --> 00:21:26.260
kind of engine behind the rapid growth.
So in the field of Ai,

336
00:21:26.320 --> 00:21:28.660
we always ask these questions when,

337
00:21:28.661 --> 00:21:33.280
what's some day AI surpass humans and what is the objective tests?

338
00:21:33.610 --> 00:21:37.570
So,
uh,
where,
uh,
all totally amazed.

339
00:21:37.600 --> 00:21:40.570
So to see the power is Google has made,
uh,

340
00:21:40.610 --> 00:21:45.610
announced two years ago about deep minds having other goal which would beat a

341
00:21:46.061 --> 00:21:51.010
human player in playing the game.
So anti was a very fortunate,
uh,

342
00:21:51.040 --> 00:21:54.910
that,
uh,
our son,
uh,
Brian was also,
uh,
at,
uh,

343
00:21:55.000 --> 00:21:59.080
working at the deep mind,
these kinds of projects at the same time at that time.

344
00:21:59.620 --> 00:22:01.630
So,
uh,
when we asked this question,

345
00:22:01.631 --> 00:22:05.530
so I'd like to revisit a question that we always have been asking,

346
00:22:05.800 --> 00:22:07.720
namely the so called Turing test.

347
00:22:07.960 --> 00:22:12.960
When is the objective tests that AI really past the human mind?

348
00:22:13.390 --> 00:22:16.660
So touring propose the following tests a long time ago.

349
00:22:16.870 --> 00:22:19.210
He says that if we have a human,
uh,

350
00:22:19.230 --> 00:22:23.370
and then we're having a conversation with a,
uh,

351
00:22:23.410 --> 00:22:27.850
something behind the curtain,
either another human or a AI machine.

352
00:22:28.120 --> 00:22:31.540
And two,
if you talk for one long day and afterwards,

353
00:22:31.541 --> 00:22:35.650
you cannot tell the difference whether it's a human behind or whether it's a

354
00:22:35.651 --> 00:22:36.490
machine behind.

355
00:22:36.760 --> 00:22:41.760
That may be the day when AI really reached a true human intelligence,

356
00:22:42.490 --> 00:22:47.260
but I think it's not the objective test.
So,
first of all,
because the human brain,

357
00:22:47.290 --> 00:22:50.680
it took a long,
long time to evolve.
And a lot of these,
uh,

358
00:22:50.700 --> 00:22:55.060
human brain has a lot of irrational emotional components.

359
00:22:55.300 --> 00:22:58.330
And maybe it can not be so imitated by the machine,

360
00:22:58.331 --> 00:23:02.950
maybe also totally unnecessary for the machine to imitate every human

361
00:23:02.980 --> 00:23:03.910
irrationality.

362
00:23:03.910 --> 00:23:08.910
That's possible because one strategy is to talk to the machine totally

363
00:23:09.161 --> 00:23:09.994
irrational way.

364
00:23:10.210 --> 00:23:13.820
Maybe a ration of machine will be very hard to food the human too,
to,

365
00:23:14.020 --> 00:23:16.510
to see that it's actually a human.
So,

366
00:23:16.511 --> 00:23:20.290
but then what about the Google success at deepmind?
Off Our Alpha goal,

367
00:23:20.320 --> 00:23:23.830
which is a game of human and it looks a little bit more objective,

368
00:23:24.100 --> 00:23:27.710
but still it is a game invented by humans.
Why should uh,

369
00:23:27.840 --> 00:23:32.290
intelligence test B based on,
again,
that's invented by human.

370
00:23:32.650 --> 00:23:37.650
So what will be the most objective tests that AI really reached a human

371
00:23:37.691 --> 00:23:38.524
intelligence.

372
00:23:38.890 --> 00:23:43.780
So I like to have a proposal which could possibly replace the Turing test.

373
00:23:44.200 --> 00:23:47.870
And then I ask to play a game of nature name.

374
00:23:47.890 --> 00:23:52.640
They ask the machine to make a scientific discovery and before the humans do.

375
00:23:53.150 --> 00:23:57.800
And maybe,
and then we can objectively use,
such as a prediction of a Mirena,

376
00:23:57.830 --> 00:23:59.810
thermia gravitational wave,

377
00:23:59.960 --> 00:24:04.790
some of the greatest to prediction of the human scientific mind and see if the

378
00:24:04.791 --> 00:24:07.970
machine can make a prediction,
uh,
before the humans do.

379
00:24:07.970 --> 00:24:11.690
And we were doing an objective experiment and verified the prediction.

380
00:24:12.030 --> 00:24:16.640
We say dcis today when machine surpassed human intelligence.

381
00:24:17.360 --> 00:24:19.940
So can we see whether this is possible or not?

382
00:24:19.941 --> 00:24:24.240
So I am usually a theoretical physicist,
but I,

383
00:24:24.260 --> 00:24:29.090
for the first time I wrote a paper on AI,
which was some be published.

384
00:24:29.510 --> 00:24:33.080
So basic idea,
is that a,
that's pic.
So first of all,

385
00:24:33.081 --> 00:24:36.830
we haven't made the progress of making a prediction that humans has not made.

386
00:24:37.160 --> 00:24:42.050
But so we,
our ideas to be wine,
the history to say that if humanity,

387
00:24:42.051 --> 00:24:46.340
is it still at a point where one great discovery hasn't yet been made and

388
00:24:46.360 --> 00:24:51.290
whether the machine at the same level can make that a scientific discovery.

389
00:24:52.010 --> 00:24:56.960
So we know some great predictions in theoretical physics such as gravitational

390
00:24:56.961 --> 00:24:59.930
wave,
uh,
derog,
antiparticle and so on.

391
00:25:00.170 --> 00:25:05.000
But maybe the greatest scientific achievements in chemistry is the Mandalay is

392
00:25:05.120 --> 00:25:06.110
periodic table.

393
00:25:06.380 --> 00:25:11.380
So Mandalay have looked at all the chemical compounds and he discovered in a

394
00:25:12.290 --> 00:25:16.970
brilliant stroke of genius,
the organizing principle of the world,
namely,

395
00:25:17.150 --> 00:25:22.150
that the order materials that we see can be reduced to,

396
00:25:22.540 --> 00:25:27.470
uh,
elements,
but these elements organizing itself into a periodic table.

397
00:25:27.860 --> 00:25:29.810
So at that time,
he,
uh,

398
00:25:29.811 --> 00:25:33.410
there's only a limited number of elements discovered.

399
00:25:33.620 --> 00:25:36.320
And once he organized them into a period of table,

400
00:25:36.410 --> 00:25:40.130
he sees some hosts in the periodic table and he says,
oh,

401
00:25:40.131 --> 00:25:42.440
these elements must be there.
You guys look for it.

402
00:25:42.650 --> 00:25:45.290
So there was the brilliant a prediction.

403
00:25:45.430 --> 00:25:47.780
And I think certainly I would rank these,

404
00:25:47.930 --> 00:25:52.490
the greatest at scientific discovery in chemistry,
maybe of all humanity.

405
00:25:53.150 --> 00:25:57.860
So the question we would like to ask ourself is that if we rewind history,
that,

406
00:25:57.861 --> 00:26:02.600
uh,
we are in a stage that a periodic table has not yet been discovered,

407
00:26:02.900 --> 00:26:06.830
but if we feed or the chemical compounds to a machine,

408
00:26:07.100 --> 00:26:10.880
what machine be able to come up with the discovery of the periodic table?

409
00:26:12.140 --> 00:26:12.711
So that's a,

410
00:26:12.711 --> 00:26:16.190
maybe it's quite related to all the AI work that's going on at Google

411
00:26:18.380 --> 00:26:22.820
and we actually core or a algorithm atom to Vec.

412
00:26:23.180 --> 00:26:24.350
So once we see the name,

413
00:26:24.380 --> 00:26:28.700
you immediately see that there must be a lot of connection to maybe all the work

414
00:26:28.701 --> 00:26:30.850
you guys are doing here.
Namely there's uh,

415
00:26:30.940 --> 00:26:35.840
all the Google translate or the natural language processing is based on a

416
00:26:35.841 --> 00:26:38.330
algorithm caught word two VEC,

417
00:26:38.750 --> 00:26:42.230
two map words into a vectorial form.

418
00:26:42.500 --> 00:26:47.250
And once you woods until Victoria form,
you can understand,
uh,
the machine,

419
00:26:47.251 --> 00:26:52.251
the vector actually in coats some semantic meaning of the word itself and they

420
00:26:53.670 --> 00:26:55.560
can discover certain relationships.

421
00:26:55.890 --> 00:27:00.890
So hardest word to Vec work basically tried to understand a word in the context

422
00:27:01.290 --> 00:27:05.280
of other sentences.
If two words often occur together,

423
00:27:05.510 --> 00:27:07.440
like king and Queen in one sentence,

424
00:27:07.560 --> 00:27:11.940
the machine will understand maybe in vectorial space there somehow close to each

425
00:27:11.941 --> 00:27:12.750
other.

426
00:27:12.750 --> 00:27:17.750
So our idea is to borrow this kind of idea from the natural language processing

427
00:27:18.420 --> 00:27:23.070
and try to see if it is possible to be used to make scientific discoveries.

428
00:27:23.370 --> 00:27:25.920
So we're basically just like a Google here,

429
00:27:25.921 --> 00:27:30.921
which a feed or the Corpus of texts into a machine using word two vec and then

430
00:27:32.551 --> 00:27:36.180
discovered the meaning of the words and then do translation and so on so forth.

431
00:27:36.390 --> 00:27:38.460
We basically feed in a total,

432
00:27:38.461 --> 00:27:43.461
totally and supervised way or the list of all chemical compounds to the machine

433
00:27:44.160 --> 00:27:47.970
and to see whether the machine can come up with an organizing principle.

434
00:27:48.300 --> 00:27:49.410
And Lo and behold,

435
00:27:49.590 --> 00:27:54.390
the machine or algorithm discovered the periodic table because the period table,

436
00:27:54.391 --> 00:27:56.560
it can be viewed as nothing but a tool dimension.

437
00:27:56.561 --> 00:27:59.370
No Victoria arrangements of all the elements.

438
00:27:59.580 --> 00:28:01.950
But if you can do something like atom to Vac,

439
00:28:02.130 --> 00:28:06.450
it will similarly match each element into some,

440
00:28:06.750 --> 00:28:10.050
uh,
some,
uh,
vectorial form.
And the,

441
00:28:10.110 --> 00:28:11.910
when you collapse these two two dimension,

442
00:28:12.090 --> 00:28:16.410
you will exactly discovered the periodic table.
So for example,
uh,

443
00:28:16.850 --> 00:28:21.600
let's see,
in a large corpus of text,
whenever you see king,
you see queen a lot,

444
00:28:21.690 --> 00:28:26.310
the co occurrence a lot,
but a,
in chemistry,
whenever you see any ACO,

445
00:28:26.311 --> 00:28:27.930
you see Kco a lot.

446
00:28:28.080 --> 00:28:33.080
So you somehow the machine will understand in a and C and k may be very related

447
00:28:33.271 --> 00:28:36.660
to each other.
So in vectorial space there must be close to each other.

448
00:28:36.990 --> 00:28:40.530
So based on,
by borrowing the ideas for natural language processing,

449
00:28:40.680 --> 00:28:45.150
we actually could organize in totally and supervised fashion.

450
00:28:45.360 --> 00:28:48.120
The machine actually discovered the periodic table.

451
00:28:48.450 --> 00:28:53.230
So I think we're getting into a very,
very exciting time that,
uh,
that a,

452
00:28:53.240 --> 00:28:57.720
uh,
one of the greatest scientific discoveries can at least be replicated by a

453
00:28:57.721 --> 00:29:01.260
machine discovery without any supervision whatsoever.

454
00:29:01.680 --> 00:29:04.080
But once these algorithms start to work,

455
00:29:04.290 --> 00:29:09.210
then we can use it to discover new materials and possibly be a user to discover

456
00:29:09.211 --> 00:29:13.410
new drugs,
uh,
before the humans can do so.

457
00:29:13.410 --> 00:29:17.670
Now let me move to the third topic of my,
uh,

458
00:29:17.671 --> 00:29:20.580
of my talk today and namely about the blockchain.

459
00:29:20.640 --> 00:29:23.140
And maybe some of you are already wondering what,
uh,

460
00:29:23.200 --> 00:29:27.540
Ai and quantum computing and blockchain can possibly have anything in common

461
00:29:27.720 --> 00:29:31.450
with each other.
So basically the Internet has always,
uh,

462
00:29:31.510 --> 00:29:36.100
has provided a tremendous value,
uh,
in as a communication tool,
uh,

463
00:29:36.300 --> 00:29:39.630
to,
uh,
to for all of us to communicate.

464
00:29:39.960 --> 00:29:44.890
But then we have at some point,
we have to exchange values over the Internet.

465
00:29:45.250 --> 00:29:48.130
But whenever we have to exchange value over the Internet,

466
00:29:48.160 --> 00:29:52.180
we have to agree on the common standards of value.
So therefore,

467
00:29:52.181 --> 00:29:56.530
the most important thing when you try to move to the next stage of the Internet

468
00:29:56.531 --> 00:30:00.490
development,
possibly moving into the world of finance,
for example,

469
00:30:03.310 --> 00:30:08.310
the key essence of finance is to have some consensus about the valley.

470
00:30:08.650 --> 00:30:08.930
Uh,

471
00:30:08.930 --> 00:30:13.570
the reason why we use goat's previously is because compared to something like an

472
00:30:13.571 --> 00:30:15.760
apple,
a as a medium of exchange,

473
00:30:15.940 --> 00:30:19.960
is because everyone can agree on what one ounce of gold actually means.

474
00:30:20.110 --> 00:30:23.800
We can do position measurement to determine its content and quality,

475
00:30:24.010 --> 00:30:27.220
but it's very hard to do it for one apple because there's so many different

476
00:30:27.221 --> 00:30:31.270
kinds of apples.
So it's not suitable as a medium of exchange.

477
00:30:31.690 --> 00:30:36.550
So therefore,
the key element of a medium of exchange is consensus.

478
00:30:36.700 --> 00:30:39.910
So if I have very broad distribution,
uh,
about the value,

479
00:30:39.940 --> 00:30:42.280
then it's not suitable to use as immediate of change.

480
00:30:42.460 --> 00:30:45.700
If we all agree on the value reaching consensus,

481
00:30:45.880 --> 00:30:48.160
then it is extremely valuable.

482
00:30:48.700 --> 00:30:53.050
So the Internet taught us one very important thing is to an MD to do things in a

483
00:30:53.051 --> 00:30:56.620
distributed fashion,
but you feel have a very distributed network.

484
00:30:56.650 --> 00:30:58.780
How can they possibly agree on something?

485
00:30:59.290 --> 00:31:03.070
So previously in human economy we always thought there has to be some

486
00:31:03.071 --> 00:31:04.120
centralized entity,

487
00:31:04.121 --> 00:31:09.121
which is trying to control a lot of it and get people to agree on some values.

488
00:31:09.910 --> 00:31:12.310
But when you actually observe the natural world,

489
00:31:12.400 --> 00:31:15.130
there is a way for the natural world to reach consensus.

490
00:31:15.190 --> 00:31:19.280
So let me give you one example or the physics.
Uh,
for example,
uh,

491
00:31:19.300 --> 00:31:21.400
where every day when you're woke up,
uh,

492
00:31:21.550 --> 00:31:24.820
and walk towards your refrigerator to get a glass of milk or something,

493
00:31:25.230 --> 00:31:28.480
people usually like to stick a magnet,
um,
their refrigerator.

494
00:31:28.720 --> 00:31:30.700
So how does a magnet really worked?

495
00:31:31.090 --> 00:31:35.770
So actually all materials consist of electrons.
Electron works like a compass.

496
00:31:35.890 --> 00:31:37.700
It has a North Pole and there's hospital.

497
00:31:37.701 --> 00:31:40.420
So electrons actually it works like a magnet,

498
00:31:40.720 --> 00:31:44.500
but the most of the time they don't agree on the direction to point to.

499
00:31:44.560 --> 00:31:48.820
So they all point in random directions and therefore globally macroscopically

500
00:31:48.821 --> 00:31:50.800
they don't behave like a magnet.

501
00:31:51.240 --> 00:31:55.750
But to the magnet that sticks on your refrigerator,
somehow miraculously,

502
00:31:55.751 --> 00:31:57.610
a consensus has been reached.
Oh,

503
00:31:57.620 --> 00:32:02.200
electrons decide to point in the same direction and that is happening without

504
00:32:02.230 --> 00:32:05.200
any centralized entity telling you,
lecture us what to do.

505
00:32:05.350 --> 00:32:08.890
Somehow there's a mechanism of a protocol of exchange.

506
00:32:09.040 --> 00:32:13.060
Somehow they miraculously agreed to a 0.1 direction,

507
00:32:13.600 --> 00:32:16.270
so details about as something very,

508
00:32:16.271 --> 00:32:21.130
very profound about the net natural world to agree on something is what is

509
00:32:21.131 --> 00:32:26.131
called the low entropy state and to be disordered is in the high entropy state.

510
00:32:26.680 --> 00:32:29.860
The natural trend of the world is to gradually,

511
00:32:29.861 --> 00:32:32.260
always the entropy has to increase over time.

512
00:32:32.500 --> 00:32:34.960
The world always becomes more and more disordered,

513
00:32:35.320 --> 00:32:39.410
but somehow in a subsystem you can actually reach hung high consensus,

514
00:32:39.560 --> 00:32:43.460
reduce entropy,
but then necessary has to,
there has to be a cost.

515
00:32:43.610 --> 00:32:46.400
You have to dump the extra entropy somewhere else.

516
00:32:46.670 --> 00:32:51.670
So it's a consensus can't happen in some self organized a distributed way,

517
00:32:52.820 --> 00:32:55.310
but there has to be a cost associated with it.

518
00:32:55.550 --> 00:32:58.280
That seems consensus is a state of low entropy.

519
00:32:58.430 --> 00:33:01.070
You have to dump the extra entropy somewhere else.

520
00:33:01.760 --> 00:33:05.930
That's icing kiss the fundamental explanation of why blockchain is working.

521
00:33:06.230 --> 00:33:11.230
So blockchain has a distributed to the world of computers and the only approach

522
00:33:11.390 --> 00:33:16.260
to have managing a distributed system of computers is to ask whether there's

523
00:33:16.280 --> 00:33:20.510
some centralized master agritourism,
deterministic algorithm possible,

524
00:33:20.690 --> 00:33:24.120
which will coordinate and and uh,

525
00:33:24.230 --> 00:33:29.230
direct or these distributed computers even though some of them have very long

526
00:33:29.481 --> 00:33:30.314
latency,

527
00:33:30.440 --> 00:33:35.000
very broad distribution of latency and someone of them can even be hacked and

528
00:33:35.001 --> 00:33:39.510
behave maliciously,
whether they're still in all these circumstances,
uh,

529
00:33:39.560 --> 00:33:44.560
master deterministic algorithm possible to tell all these computers exactly what

530
00:33:44.931 --> 00:33:49.880
to do and reach consensus.
Then there's a famous result in computer science code,

531
00:33:49.881 --> 00:33:54.080
the Fisher Lynch Patterson,
which actually is a no go result,

532
00:33:54.230 --> 00:33:58.370
which says such a master deterministic algorithm is not possible.

533
00:33:59.150 --> 00:34:03.560
So this actually is a very reminds me of central result of physics.

534
00:34:03.620 --> 00:34:06.260
Namely the entropy always have to increase.

535
00:34:06.350 --> 00:34:11.210
You have such kind of a master algorithm exists.
Actually we have a name for it.

536
00:34:11.240 --> 00:34:15.920
It's called Maxwell's demon.
So somehow this demon has very high intelligence.

537
00:34:16.040 --> 00:34:16.611
For example,

538
00:34:16.611 --> 00:34:21.200
if you have a component of our gas and you have a war dividing between them and

539
00:34:21.201 --> 00:34:23.690
you have a little hole,
the Maxwell's demon,

540
00:34:23.720 --> 00:34:26.630
when it sees a high energy particle funded the left,

541
00:34:26.690 --> 00:34:31.280
it opens the shutter ladies through and to low energy particle coming through

542
00:34:31.310 --> 00:34:33.490
and the closest the shadow and doesn't it.

543
00:34:33.500 --> 00:34:36.380
So then if this demon can do all this,

544
00:34:36.770 --> 00:34:40.700
choreograph a in a efficient way,
then little bit later,

545
00:34:40.790 --> 00:34:44.720
these sites where be much harder than this site and then you can extra some work

546
00:34:44.721 --> 00:34:48.830
to it.
So such centralized entity to coordinate,
we're really,
uh,

547
00:34:48.850 --> 00:34:51.530
be able to extract energy out of nowhere.

548
00:34:51.800 --> 00:34:54.260
And this obviously is not possible.

549
00:34:54.620 --> 00:34:57.200
So I like to make the analogy of the Fisher Lynch.

550
00:34:57.200 --> 00:34:59.960
Patterson's theory was the concept of the Maxwell Demon.

551
00:35:00.350 --> 00:35:03.710
None of them are possible.
The master algorithm is not possible.

552
00:35:03.980 --> 00:35:07.730
And to Maxwell demon is not possible.
So what's the solution?

553
00:35:07.790 --> 00:35:10.190
The solution is provided by the blockchain.

554
00:35:10.280 --> 00:35:15.280
So if you want the entire distributed Internet to agree on some temporal order,

555
00:35:16.040 --> 00:35:19.010
which is the most crucial thing for financial transactions,

556
00:35:19.011 --> 00:35:22.520
which transaction happened first?
Which transaction happens later?

557
00:35:22.850 --> 00:35:25.070
You want to order machines to vote,

558
00:35:25.130 --> 00:35:28.970
but voting at a cost by solving what is called a hash puzzle.

559
00:35:29.240 --> 00:35:31.760
Only those machine can,
which can solve a hash puzzle,

560
00:35:31.850 --> 00:35:34.790
which is very difficult to solve,
but very easy to verify.

561
00:35:35.030 --> 00:35:39.360
Then once a machine soft these hash puzzle,
every machine will agree that yes,

562
00:35:39.390 --> 00:35:42.540
this is true and we agree on this temporal order.

563
00:35:42.870 --> 00:35:45.890
So it's such to Shasta Algorithm and it's,
uh,

564
00:35:45.920 --> 00:35:50.920
actually requires energy to compute and to reach these hash puzzle.

565
00:35:51.420 --> 00:35:54.960
So therefore in the self organized blockchain consensus mechanism,

566
00:35:55.080 --> 00:35:58.170
we reach consensus,
namely in a state of low entropy,

567
00:35:58.290 --> 00:36:01.010
but we dumped extra entropy somewhere else.
Uh,

568
00:36:01.070 --> 00:36:03.060
Serrada computation of the hash puzzle.

569
00:36:03.330 --> 00:36:07.320
And that is very similar to what's happening the physical world.
Namely,

570
00:36:07.321 --> 00:36:12.321
we can in principle reach the state of consensus of low entropy provided if we

571
00:36:12.881 --> 00:36:14.820
dump extra entropy's somewhere else.

572
00:36:15.090 --> 00:36:20.090
So I really think this is really one of the most brilliant invention of in human

573
00:36:20.131 --> 00:36:20.760
history.

574
00:36:20.760 --> 00:36:25.760
Somehow we can have a natural and objective mechanism in the distributed world

575
00:36:26.610 --> 00:36:29.250
to reach consensus,
but there's a cost to it.

576
00:36:29.420 --> 00:36:31.260
Then they have to do this mining work.

577
00:36:31.410 --> 00:36:34.710
So that the extra entropy can be dumped somewhere else.

578
00:36:35.100 --> 00:36:37.410
So once we have this consensus mechanism,

579
00:36:37.650 --> 00:36:40.290
I think this offers a great new opportunity,

580
00:36:43.080 --> 00:36:46.680
new kind of a symbiosis between blockchain and AI.

581
00:36:47.190 --> 00:36:51.660
So I talked about Aib and conference,
a major conference of three major trends.

582
00:36:51.690 --> 00:36:55.590
I eluded to,
uh,
to the computational power,

583
00:36:55.591 --> 00:36:58.500
most law and then possibly quantum computers.

584
00:36:58.740 --> 00:37:02.340
I also talk about some new inventions in the algorithm,

585
00:37:02.610 --> 00:37:07.320
but to what AI needs the most is to have data so that AI can learn.

586
00:37:07.830 --> 00:37:12.360
But right now our data are concentrated as centralized platforms.

587
00:37:12.420 --> 00:37:17.420
So there's very little incentive for individuals to contribute data because they

588
00:37:17.431 --> 00:37:22.431
basically get nothing in return and maybe their privacy could even be violated.

589
00:37:23.250 --> 00:37:27.310
So I envisioned the future of the world where the ownership of that data,

590
00:37:27.311 --> 00:37:30.600
it should be completely be returned to the individuals.

591
00:37:30.750 --> 00:37:34.230
So all my personal data or my behavior data on my online data,

592
00:37:34.231 --> 00:37:36.540
on my genomics data or my medical records,

593
00:37:36.541 --> 00:37:41.070
everything should be owned by the individual and the privacy should be

594
00:37:41.071 --> 00:37:44.820
completely protected.
But then you'll say,
wow.
Then CalCom machine,

595
00:37:44.830 --> 00:37:48.270
possibly learning this thing,
if everybody keeps their secret private.

596
00:37:48.660 --> 00:37:53.660
And there is a beautiful thing called privacy preserving computation and that

597
00:37:53.730 --> 00:37:57.590
will make it possible to have a data marketplace.
So I,
first off,

598
00:37:57.591 --> 00:37:59.760
we're protected all my privacy data,

599
00:37:59.940 --> 00:38:04.920
but I can leak information out one bit at a time.
Totally at mind control.

600
00:38:05.340 --> 00:38:10.110
And a such a world will be a data marketplace,
the individually,

601
00:38:10.140 --> 00:38:12.000
so it's a peer to peer marketplace,

602
00:38:12.150 --> 00:38:17.070
whereas individually under their private data and then there can be a bidding

603
00:38:17.071 --> 00:38:18.720
and sending a process,

604
00:38:18.920 --> 00:38:22.710
a very selectively control by performing privacy,

605
00:38:22.711 --> 00:38:24.570
preserving data marketplace.

606
00:38:25.350 --> 00:38:29.670
So such a future world of a,
of a marketplace,
uh,

607
00:38:29.820 --> 00:38:34.300
based on one thing support,
which I caught in math,
we trust.
Uh,

608
00:38:34.310 --> 00:38:38.350
and that's is a possible with that it's a,

609
00:38:38.351 --> 00:38:41.300
it that you can still preserve privacy,
uh,

610
00:38:41.350 --> 00:38:46.060
but still maintain a and but still can do a computation that,

611
00:38:46.330 --> 00:38:49.300
uh,
only leaks out very,
very selectively,

612
00:38:49.301 --> 00:38:51.940
one in piece of inflammation at a time.

613
00:38:52.420 --> 00:38:56.920
So the famous province is called the secure multiparty computation or a

614
00:38:56.921 --> 00:39:00.880
millionaire province.
So obviously private wealth is very,

615
00:39:00.881 --> 00:39:04.000
very private.
So people don't like to reveal.
But yeah,

616
00:39:04.020 --> 00:39:05.890
it could be so happened that 2 million years.

617
00:39:05.891 --> 00:39:09.400
Want to compare how we switcher but without revealing to each other.

618
00:39:09.401 --> 00:39:11.860
If they review to each other,
the wells,

619
00:39:11.861 --> 00:39:16.510
they have obviously a you there we'll find out,
but leaks too much privacy data.

620
00:39:16.780 --> 00:39:21.780
But there's a computation or protocol called Yas Yas Cobbold circuit that they

621
00:39:22.421 --> 00:39:24.610
can exchange protocol in the end of the day,

622
00:39:24.611 --> 00:39:27.290
they only find out one bit of information.
Now May,

623
00:39:27.300 --> 00:39:29.080
who is Richard without revealing anything,

624
00:39:29.830 --> 00:39:32.860
there's a idea of a differential privacy,

625
00:39:32.890 --> 00:39:37.870
namely adding noise to a private data so that they don't become individually

626
00:39:37.871 --> 00:39:41.770
identifiable.
But if I want to conduct a collective survey,

627
00:39:41.950 --> 00:39:46.480
I can add noise in such a way that in the statistical aggregate the noise will

628
00:39:46.481 --> 00:39:51.070
cancel out.
So the statistical information is completely accurate.
But no,

629
00:39:51.280 --> 00:39:52.000
not much.

630
00:39:52.000 --> 00:39:56.440
Individual private data has been leaked because there's so enough noise that

631
00:39:56.470 --> 00:40:00.590
individually identifiable information is not there.
But,
uh,

632
00:40:00.690 --> 00:40:04.240
the overall,
uh,
overall,
uh,

633
00:40:04.510 --> 00:40:06.520
statistical information still accurate.

634
00:40:06.730 --> 00:40:10.690
And then there's also the idea of zero knowledge proof.
I can prove to you,

635
00:40:10.691 --> 00:40:15.130
for example,
that I solved a very difficult game,
let's say the pseudo cocaine,

636
00:40:15.460 --> 00:40:19.600
but I want to only give you one bit of information.
Emily,
I softer game,

637
00:40:19.870 --> 00:40:22.420
but I don't want to review you.
My entire solution.

638
00:40:22.720 --> 00:40:26.860
I want you to keep on trying and Carter and this is also possible through the

639
00:40:26.861 --> 00:40:31.060
zero knowledge proof.
So there's literally a world where mathematics,

640
00:40:31.061 --> 00:40:33.970
we're enter economics in a very central way,
uh,

641
00:40:34.050 --> 00:40:38.830
in making a data marketplace possible so that way all of us were owned or

642
00:40:38.831 --> 00:40:42.070
individual data and then uh,
uh,

643
00:40:42.100 --> 00:40:46.450
Google cloud and all these entities then can compute,
uh,

644
00:40:46.451 --> 00:40:47.850
in a centralized,
eh,

645
00:40:47.950 --> 00:40:52.830
they can compute useful statistical information without revealing Roy,

646
00:40:52.950 --> 00:40:56.410
without in having us to read a review of these privacy dad.

647
00:40:57.070 --> 00:41:02.070
So I really think about this world where both AI and blockchain combined can do

648
00:41:03.611 --> 00:41:08.611
great social good in this new era of crypto economic size based on,

649
00:41:08.621 --> 00:41:09.820
in math with trust.

650
00:41:10.300 --> 00:41:14.170
Because the way you really think about what's the problem with our society today

651
00:41:14.200 --> 00:41:15.250
is because there's this,

652
00:41:15.251 --> 00:41:19.870
we're a nation against minority and that is a fundamental of our society.

653
00:41:20.260 --> 00:41:22.210
But when you really think about AI learning,

654
00:41:22.240 --> 00:41:26.680
let's say if my AI algorithm is already a working accurately in 90% of the time,

655
00:41:26.950 --> 00:41:31.950
but I want some extra data so that I can go off on 90% to 99%,

656
00:41:32.460 --> 00:41:36.950
that that I is not yet another kind of data which looks very similar to all the

657
00:41:36.951 --> 00:41:39.440
previous data I have seen.
I want data,

658
00:41:39.441 --> 00:41:42.320
which is called to have high mutual entropy,

659
00:41:42.321 --> 00:41:44.600
namely the data that's most distinct.

660
00:41:44.960 --> 00:41:48.500
And that by definition is own by the minority.
But they,

661
00:41:48.501 --> 00:41:53.480
in such a data marketplace,
I will bid the highest for those data,
which most,

662
00:41:53.600 --> 00:41:55.250
uh,
uh,
you know,
minority.

663
00:41:55.670 --> 00:41:58.670
So then the economic incentive structure would be aligned.

664
00:41:58.760 --> 00:42:02.660
Our society will be value the minority to most,
uh,

665
00:42:02.661 --> 00:42:06.950
and that's exactly what we need to do social goods.
So finally,

666
00:42:06.951 --> 00:42:11.630
there's a vision that the ugly duckling can somehow become a beautiful swan

667
00:42:11.960 --> 00:42:14.630
because the ugly duckling is not ugly.
It's different.

668
00:42:14.930 --> 00:42:19.930
But now a difference will be valued the most minorities in these fear that a

669
00:42:20.041 --> 00:42:22.550
market place will not be discriminated against.

670
00:42:23.300 --> 00:42:27.920
So I'd really see these wonderful new worlds in a conference of three major

671
00:42:27.921 --> 00:42:30.530
trends,
quantum computing,
AI and blockchain.

672
00:42:30.830 --> 00:42:35.830
But I also see myself being coming from academia and open in interactions with,

673
00:42:37.250 --> 00:42:39.410
uh,
Pontiac seeing industry.

674
00:42:39.670 --> 00:42:43.760
I will really can enter a new world where the latest,
the scientific idea,

675
00:42:43.761 --> 00:42:47.090
it's really,
really fascinating and totally amazing.

676
00:42:47.110 --> 00:42:52.110
Dentist mathematical concepts was purely invented by mathematicians in abstract

677
00:42:54.470 --> 00:42:58.050
could turn out to be so useful.
So something like number theory,
uh,

678
00:42:58.170 --> 00:43:03.170
everyday when we conduct a transaction using http s uses number theory in the

679
00:43:03.951 --> 00:43:04.940
most essential way.

680
00:43:05.210 --> 00:43:08.930
So this is the wonderful new world where collaboration with academia in the

681
00:43:08.931 --> 00:43:13.320
industry can really lead to great progress.
Uh,

682
00:43:13.470 --> 00:43:16.740
uh,
as I say,
it's the greatest opportunity,
uh,

683
00:43:16.810 --> 00:43:21.810
of making progress is oftentimes see a conference of some major trends,

684
00:43:22.010 --> 00:43:26.270
uh,
before.
And anyone who are desk in their specialized area put in,

685
00:43:26.271 --> 00:43:28.100
see the overall picture and tie,

686
00:43:28.101 --> 00:43:32.600
really seen that the symbiosis among these three major trends will be the

687
00:43:32.601 --> 00:43:37.280
defining characteristic of the future of inflammation technology.
Thank you.

688
00:43:42.070 --> 00:43:44.090
<v 2>Could I entertain some questions?</v>

689
00:43:46.500 --> 00:43:51.500
<v 3>So you've talked about the consensus and how proof of work systems achieve a gun</v>

690
00:43:51.541 --> 00:43:55.260
sense despite this to be a deacon like these it will be,
yeah.
How does it,

691
00:43:55.440 --> 00:43:58.160
how best start working before statements?
Thank you.
Yeah.
Yeah.

692
00:43:58.310 --> 00:43:59.810
<v 1>So,
uh,
I actually,</v>

693
00:43:59.811 --> 00:44:03.620
I think in the end of the day they should always be some tradeoffs.

694
00:44:03.920 --> 00:44:05.960
So I think can find them as a fan.

695
00:44:06.080 --> 00:44:10.430
I see the future of the blockchain world and to those,
uh,
uh,

696
00:44:10.450 --> 00:44:14.340
Krypto currency were happening in assumption what light?
Well,

697
00:44:14.420 --> 00:44:16.480
what we're heavy in the current world,
that kind of war,

698
00:44:16.560 --> 00:44:19.640
we'll have m zero m one m two different layers.

699
00:44:19.880 --> 00:44:22.040
So I believe at the most fundamental layer,

700
00:44:22.380 --> 00:44:27.380
a universal currency should be completely based on proof of work because then

701
00:44:27.651 --> 00:44:31.590
the entropy that you dump is extreme.
It's a totally transparent,

702
00:44:31.620 --> 00:44:35.100
not only has to be there,
but there's also totally transparent.

703
00:44:35.400 --> 00:44:38.490
I think at the most basic and fundamental layer,
poof,

704
00:44:38.491 --> 00:44:43.170
off state will not work because there's so much possibility of collusion that

705
00:44:43.171 --> 00:44:46.350
you can lose something I'm chain,
but gain something,
uh,

706
00:44:46.380 --> 00:44:50.550
off chain or you can be bribery and so on.
So I think where the,

707
00:44:50.640 --> 00:44:54.270
what the truly exciting thing about the blockchain world is that at the most

708
00:44:54.271 --> 00:44:55.230
fundamental layer,

709
00:44:55.560 --> 00:44:59.670
that can be something that's totally objective and only connects to the natural

710
00:44:59.671 --> 00:45:03.330
world named the energy and not so much about proof of stake,

711
00:45:03.331 --> 00:45:06.810
which a human irrationality can get involved.

712
00:45:07.470 --> 00:45:08.610
But I came very well.

713
00:45:08.611 --> 00:45:12.090
You Imagine I'm the higher layers then they will prove I wrote.

714
00:45:12.510 --> 00:45:17.070
But the most fundamental layer such like m one or m zero,
it should be,

715
00:45:17.130 --> 00:45:19.110
uh,
completely robust.

716
00:45:19.200 --> 00:45:23.040
And I still think the proof of work or this is something,
uh,

717
00:45:23.041 --> 00:45:27.150
another approach which is called proof of space,
time proof office space,

718
00:45:27.330 --> 00:45:31.080
which is based on storage.
And that's,
I think it's also,

719
00:45:31.140 --> 00:45:35.700
it's a pong certifiable physical resources,
uh,
I think get the most,

720
00:45:35.701 --> 00:45:39.720
basically you're a human things to them being involved,

721
00:45:41.480 --> 00:45:42.960
but maybe at a higher layers.

722
00:45:44.080 --> 00:45:49.000
<v 4>Can you elaborate on that?
Watching?</v>

723
00:45:49.001 --> 00:45:53.460
So financial client computing requires Metairie transformations and it's not,

724
00:45:53.530 --> 00:45:57.520
it's something that should be reversible.
I'm like ashes.
Yeah.

725
00:45:57.660 --> 00:45:58.710
<v 1>So I mostly,</v>

726
00:45:58.720 --> 00:46:03.110
I think about a hundred computing may be useful for AI as a search algorithms.

727
00:46:03.630 --> 00:46:08.220
So a one algorithm for,
so all these are also happening.

728
00:46:08.300 --> 00:46:11.580
So one of the most interesting,
uh,
uh,

729
00:46:11.581 --> 00:46:16.230
approach to AI is the king,
right?
Jen?
Every tiff at rosary and networks.

730
00:46:16.500 --> 00:46:18.420
So I don't mean this is three trends.

731
00:46:18.470 --> 00:46:20.790
I'll always necessarily have to work together.

732
00:46:21.090 --> 00:46:24.120
They can actually leads to progress by competing with each other.

733
00:46:24.510 --> 00:46:28.500
So in one aspect of quantum computing and blockchain and somewhat competing with

734
00:46:28.501 --> 00:46:33.420
each other because I loved her to quit or encoding algorithm could be broken by

735
00:46:33.421 --> 00:46:35.070
plankton.
But on the other hand,

736
00:46:35.280 --> 00:46:40.170
I also see that a quantum can help AI in doing the most efficient search.

737
00:46:40.920 --> 00:46:43.090
And that's what also what AI needs to do,
right?

738
00:46:44.640 --> 00:46:49.590
So this relationship is very much like a symbiosis in the ecosystem.

739
00:46:50.310 --> 00:46:54.630
There's both competition and collaboration.
Yeah.

740
00:46:54.631 --> 00:46:58.920
We can not just use our human will to decade.
They will always do the same thing.

741
00:46:59.140 --> 00:47:03.110
They,
I think in the process of competition,
they will all become stronger.

742
00:47:05.090 --> 00:47:09.530
<v 5>You mentioned a universal currency or n zero.
Yeah.
I'm curious.</v>

743
00:47:09.570 --> 00:47:12.620
I know your theoretical physicists,
but an execution to that.

744
00:47:12.621 --> 00:47:14.420
When we think about an iPhone,
for example,

745
00:47:14.421 --> 00:47:17.210
my iPhone seven talks to the iPhone six die from five,

746
00:47:17.590 --> 00:47:20.390
but there's a metal layer of consensus to be reached that's like,

747
00:47:20.420 --> 00:47:24.530
I actually agree into this distributed system.
Yeah.
Curly and Crypto,

748
00:47:24.531 --> 00:47:28.840
there's many fragmented pools of liquidity,
quote unquote.
So how,

749
00:47:29.000 --> 00:47:30.100
how do you bridge that

750
00:47:30.100 --> 00:47:33.670
<v 1>gap between where we are now in these?
So I think could have,
for example,</v>

751
00:47:33.671 --> 00:47:35.020
delegation should be changed.

752
00:47:35.021 --> 00:47:39.770
The bitcoin blockchain lightening network very much fits to this framework off m

753
00:47:39.771 --> 00:47:42.790
one and two.
Uh,
so at the,
basically you're,

754
00:47:42.810 --> 00:47:46.930
the blockchain is completely objective,
be some proof of work,
uh,
and to dcis.

755
00:47:46.931 --> 00:47:51.070
The church trait would reach the most universal consensus among parties,

756
00:47:51.071 --> 00:47:54.550
which I totally don't know each other.
And then you'd still need to trance out.

757
00:47:54.880 --> 00:47:57.040
But when you really think about business transaction,

758
00:47:57.280 --> 00:48:02.080
maybe 12 us to already have been working very well as partners in the last 10

759
00:48:02.081 --> 00:48:06.250
years.
So why should we still use treating each other as a,

760
00:48:06.251 --> 00:48:08.110
as a totally strangers?

761
00:48:08.320 --> 00:48:13.320
So what we can do is we enter into each other a state channel by putting our

762
00:48:13.511 --> 00:48:18.010
collaborators on the blockchain.
But we keep on doing very,
very fast trading,

763
00:48:18.011 --> 00:48:20.260
but we still saddle once a month.

764
00:48:20.680 --> 00:48:25.000
So this is I think exactly like the relationship between m zero m one m two,

765
00:48:25.330 --> 00:48:28.960
the relationship between lightening and Bitcoin is like the relationship between

766
00:48:28.961 --> 00:48:33.100
m zero and one.
So,
uh,
when you got above every layer,

767
00:48:33.390 --> 00:48:37.990
so there's should be,
it's a less robust but we'll be more efficient.

768
00:48:38.200 --> 00:48:42.040
But the trade off comes from our history that were already had a history of

769
00:48:42.041 --> 00:48:45.760
trust.
But if you have business partners,
they already,
someone know each other.

770
00:48:46.030 --> 00:48:50.920
They don't absolutely have to use the most universal robust,
uh,
layer.

771
00:48:50.980 --> 00:48:55.980
They can establish a higher layer where they sacrifice some universality.

772
00:48:56.860 --> 00:49:00.450
But uh,
in exchange for efficiency,
yes.

773
00:49:02.470 --> 00:49:06.820
Particle
positive or negative.

774
00:49:07.190 --> 00:49:09.280
Yeah.
So it's a half or two bits,

775
00:49:09.820 --> 00:49:14.260
it sounds like identity and I'm an astronaut,
bro.
Ring or field,
right.

776
00:49:14.650 --> 00:49:16.780
Identity animate.
You know,
when a,
again,

777
00:49:16.790 --> 00:49:21.790
it itself stays at the same identity and I know that more precise analogy,

778
00:49:22.570 --> 00:49:26.470
it's like a complex number can be expressing in terms of tool,
real numbers.

779
00:49:26.830 --> 00:49:30.040
So the,
so a complex number,
he's like a particle.

780
00:49:30.280 --> 00:49:34.060
The complex conjugate is like the antiparticle,
but if you have the real number,

781
00:49:34.061 --> 00:49:37.860
the complex conjugate is the same as itself.
Okay.
So,
so,

782
00:49:37.861 --> 00:49:40.660
so the NGO particle is more like a real number.
I see.

783
00:49:40.900 --> 00:49:45.590
How would you now when you think of like on a yet forces yeah,
yeah,
yeah.

784
00:49:46.420 --> 00:49:51.310
One would be new to animate whether we would be the NGO.
Yeah.
Yeah.

785
00:49:51.311 --> 00:49:54.310
So,
so yeah.
Uh,
so yeah.
Uh,

786
00:49:54.340 --> 00:49:58.520
well I think the analogy is just to say that that uh,
so here,

787
00:49:58.720 --> 00:50:01.420
this one incoming quantum cubit,

788
00:50:01.840 --> 00:50:05.710
but actual computation before you do actual computation,
you're splitting them.

789
00:50:06.190 --> 00:50:10.180
And by splitting them,
they're already kind of become nonlocal.

790
00:50:10.210 --> 00:50:13.570
They're entangled but a classical noise,
it's not entangled.

791
00:50:13.960 --> 00:50:16.840
So it's impossible to destroy it using classical noise.

792
00:50:17.050 --> 00:50:20.800
So that's why topological quantum computer can be so much more robust.

793
00:50:23.440 --> 00:50:28.160
Yes.
Combining a couple of the themes of your talk,
if a,
for able to

794
00:50:28.190 --> 00:50:33.190
<v 6>harness the power of quantum competing and if we're able to then secure our data</v>

795
00:50:33.351 --> 00:50:37.460
through,
uh,
you know,
privacy and encrypted ways of being able to share it.
Yeah.

796
00:50:37.540 --> 00:50:37.850
Um,

797
00:50:37.850 --> 00:50:41.810
I'm wondering how you see the future of Google because that seems like a truly

798
00:50:41.811 --> 00:50:42.860
existential threat.

799
00:50:43.190 --> 00:50:46.640
If anyone can spin up a quantum computer that can do extremely efficient

800
00:50:46.641 --> 00:50:49.310
parallel search.
Yeah.
And then they can harness everyone's data.

801
00:50:50.040 --> 00:50:53.700
<v 1>My way is to not resist changes but to embrace change.
Right,</v>

802
00:50:53.910 --> 00:50:58.810
<v 6>right,
right.
So how do you see,
for example,
the world?</v>

803
00:50:58.820 --> 00:50:59.100
Yeah,

804
00:50:59.100 --> 00:51:01.860
<v 1>yeah.
Actually,
uh,
I have an answer to these.</v>

805
00:51:04.250 --> 00:51:04.510
<v 2>Okay.</v>

806
00:51:04.510 --> 00:51:07.590
<v 1>So,
uh,
in,
in this way,
uh,</v>

807
00:51:07.910 --> 00:51:12.310
actually we can do the following construct data.
So for example,

808
00:51:12.311 --> 00:51:16.090
my private data,
and I want to store it in a secure way,

809
00:51:16.091 --> 00:51:18.580
but still be possible to do some computation.

810
00:51:19.000 --> 00:51:22.060
So we know Google cloud competes with Amazon cloud.

811
00:51:22.330 --> 00:51:25.420
So what we can do is that,
um,
the Amazon cloud,

812
00:51:25.510 --> 00:51:28.960
I still completely random numbers,
but on the Google Cloud,

813
00:51:28.990 --> 00:51:33.060
I store my inflammation plus the vending information.

814
00:51:33.070 --> 00:51:36.940
I Still Amazon cloud.
So if I really can't assume this,

815
00:51:36.950 --> 00:51:39.280
these two entities are really competing very hard.

816
00:51:39.340 --> 00:51:43.210
Maybe there's no collusion and there there's no way they will secretly the

817
00:51:43.211 --> 00:51:44.044
exchange.

818
00:51:44.230 --> 00:51:48.910
But then you can use the protocol off secure multiparty computation to do a

819
00:51:48.911 --> 00:51:53.800
computation which gets only one result without revealing any details.

820
00:51:54.580 --> 00:51:58.960
So in this world,
centralized entity still is useful.

821
00:51:59.350 --> 00:52:00.820
But in order for this to work,

822
00:52:00.821 --> 00:52:04.450
you have to assume that are competing but not colluding.

823
00:52:05.490 --> 00:52:06.840
<v 7>Hi,
I'm just wondering,</v>

824
00:52:07.050 --> 00:52:11.070
the youth of term entropy is interesting because it seemed to be this mysterious

825
00:52:11.071 --> 00:52:11.401
thing,

826
00:52:11.401 --> 00:52:14.990
but it's also very precise that in thermodynamics you'll never logarithm term
in,

827
00:52:14.991 --> 00:52:18.190
um,
in classical thermodynamics and then you have clash.

828
00:52:18.240 --> 00:52:21.960
And then with information,
so we,
we have an entropy and then you may get analogy,

829
00:52:21.990 --> 00:52:22.830
you think energy,
it's,

830
00:52:22.831 --> 00:52:25.980
that kind of reminds me of like I'm some sort of free energy.

831
00:52:26.090 --> 00:52:27.970
<v 1>Yeah.
And you can see exactly,
yeah.
So,</v>

832
00:52:28.090 --> 00:52:31.010
so I think the blockchain world is exactly extracting,

833
00:52:31.160 --> 00:52:35.090
extracting some free energy out of it.
So,
so,
so yeah,

834
00:52:35.091 --> 00:52:37.760
basically you're achieving something,

835
00:52:37.790 --> 00:52:42.260
but whatever you achieve the total amount of energy to use useful amount,
uh,

836
00:52:42.270 --> 00:52:47.120
it's only the energy you spent minus the entropy that you have to waste.

837
00:52:47.330 --> 00:52:48.170
So the subtract.

838
00:52:48.171 --> 00:52:51.920
And so a lot of you actually today still see a lot of white papers.

839
00:52:52.190 --> 00:52:54.020
They claim to do miraculous things.

840
00:52:54.350 --> 00:52:58.730
And this kind of white papers reminds me of the proposals in the 18th century

841
00:52:58.731 --> 00:52:59.890
about the pitcher.
Mobili

842
00:53:01.740 --> 00:53:02.980
<v 7>um,
I'm just,
I'm wondering,</v>

843
00:53:02.981 --> 00:53:06.100
can you extrapolate that now that you further then you need a temperature term

844
00:53:06.101 --> 00:53:07.080
for the Collegian to work?

845
00:53:07.610 --> 00:53:10.570
<v 1>Yeah,
yeah,
yeah.
Yeah.
Actually the temperature of course,</v>

846
00:53:10.571 --> 00:53:15.440
a very natural lean if when Emily you have are conserved quantity as such as a

847
00:53:15.450 --> 00:53:18.630
conservation of energy,
uh,
the temperature concept,

848
00:53:18.631 --> 00:53:23.580
naturally a boss because anytime you have a rendering but conservative system,

849
00:53:23.910 --> 00:53:27.780
uh,
it's the most generic what is called a Boltzmann distribution.
So the entropy,

850
00:53:28.020 --> 00:53:31.970
the temperature comes in naturally,
but I think include lit.

851
00:53:32.070 --> 00:53:34.410
Why I get so excited about this is the,

852
00:53:34.411 --> 00:53:38.230
for the first time I see a convergence between social science and natural

853
00:53:38.240 --> 00:53:39.073
science.

854
00:53:39.620 --> 00:53:44.620
That's team provides an anchor for the social scientific world named at the

855
00:53:44.821 --> 00:53:47.850
front.
So in my idea for m zero m one m two,

856
00:53:48.180 --> 00:53:52.380
the fundamental anchor is not anchored on natural science.

857
00:53:52.620 --> 00:53:55.350
We can precisely see the entropy.
It's wasted.

858
00:53:55.351 --> 00:54:00.000
So we can see why it's consensus is reached and then you can build a more human

859
00:54:00.001 --> 00:54:00.870
things on top of it.

860
00:54:00.871 --> 00:54:05.370
But then most basic layer is now common bitching situ and the natural science

861
00:54:05.670 --> 00:54:09.240
and fundamentally reduces to NV energy entropy aim formation.

862
00:54:10.380 --> 00:54:11.213
<v 2>Thanks.</v>

863
00:54:11.840 --> 00:54:14.840
<v 8>Thanks so much for your time.
Um,
so I think you were talking to,</v>

864
00:54:14.870 --> 00:54:19.220
were saying that you can see this first layer of one block chain and then

865
00:54:19.820 --> 00:54:22.290
further layers built on top of that.
Um,

866
00:54:22.370 --> 00:54:26.090
so what do you think of the various projects or companies are trying to build

867
00:54:26.480 --> 00:54:29.790
their own blockchain?
And how does that relate to her talks,
did you think?

868
00:54:30.220 --> 00:54:32.380
<v 1>I think,
uh,
I,
yeah,</v>

869
00:54:32.410 --> 00:54:36.790
so there has to be some unique thing that you provide.
So a Bra,

870
00:54:36.820 --> 00:54:40.600
a Bitcoin blockchain,
and you sitting,
I'd really different.
So,
uh,

871
00:54:40.630 --> 00:54:45.630
because as a fundamental layer of trust you after don't want universal Turing

872
00:54:46.001 --> 00:54:48.070
machine because it can be maybe hacked,

873
00:54:48.440 --> 00:54:53.440
but then you have to do some more transactions on top of it and then you see

874
00:54:53.771 --> 00:54:55.180
random look,
some more natural.

875
00:54:55.570 --> 00:55:00.570
So the evolution of the blockchain world will emulate the evolution of

876
00:55:01.151 --> 00:55:06.080
biological species.
Uh,
you see fall king,
you see different species.
Uh,

877
00:55:06.230 --> 00:55:09.430
if they fought long enough,
maybe they become a different species,

878
00:55:09.670 --> 00:55:11.530
but there's always something fundamental,

879
00:55:11.830 --> 00:55:14.920
namely or biological beings are based ourselves.

880
00:55:15.130 --> 00:55:18.580
So this kind of basic contracts or not change,

881
00:55:18.820 --> 00:55:20.320
but to some organization,

882
00:55:20.650 --> 00:55:24.640
the different organisms at different organizations have different cells that may

883
00:55:24.641 --> 00:55:25.474
change.

884
00:55:27.370 --> 00:55:28.203
<v 2>Yes.</v>

885
00:55:29.080 --> 00:55:30.070
<v 9>Thank you for your time.</v>

886
00:55:30.071 --> 00:55:34.090
So my question is when do you think quantum computing would be in the

887
00:55:34.091 --> 00:55:35.490
application?
Uh,

888
00:55:36.070 --> 00:55:40.780
like after your findings and research and vanities in the application.

889
00:55:40.781 --> 00:55:42.640
Do you think it's going to be in the hands of,

890
00:55:42.820 --> 00:55:46.030
on the big certain companies or it's with its scale?

891
00:55:46.400 --> 00:55:48.320
<v 1>Yeah,
I think so.
So yeah,</v>

892
00:55:48.321 --> 00:55:53.321
so I think a quantum computing research most ideally should be done in open

893
00:55:53.871 --> 00:55:58.670
environment.
Uh,
I think because,
uh,
yeah,

894
00:55:58.710 --> 00:56:02.360
then you just make these statements because I know a lot of companies are
trying,

895
00:56:02.690 --> 00:56:07.270
but the very nature of company training is they have to protect shareholder

896
00:56:07.280 --> 00:56:11.660
anxious.
They have to protect the secret but to,
for something so powerful,

897
00:56:12.150 --> 00:56:14.420
uh,
and its implication for humanity.

898
00:56:14.421 --> 00:56:19.280
So I know that I think it should be best conducted team open university

899
00:56:19.281 --> 00:56:19.720
research.

900
00:56:19.720 --> 00:56:20.553
<v 2>Sure.</v>

901
00:56:22.750 --> 00:56:23.980
<v 1>And is exactly what I'm</v>

902
00:56:23.980 --> 00:56:28.780
<v 3>doing.
So my approach to quantum computer,
I have many,</v>

903
00:56:28.781 --> 00:56:33.340
many temptations to do a company.
I'll quantum computers,
but I'd resisted that

904
00:56:37.230 --> 00:56:38.910
<v 1>with or without my,
you mentioned,</v>

905
00:56:40.800 --> 00:56:42.970
I think if you use this old way of uh,

906
00:56:43.070 --> 00:56:47.010
if you use this way of train it will take a long,
long time.

907
00:56:47.550 --> 00:56:52.540
Can you just imagine for one useful cubit you'd need to 70 cubic to the it
icing.

908
00:56:52.560 --> 00:56:55.230
It wouldn't scale,
but with this approach you were scale.

909
00:56:57.520 --> 00:57:02.240
<v 3>Okay.
I think we wrap up,
I'm going to ask one last question.</v>

910
00:57:02.290 --> 00:57:06.770
Okay.
About your angel of Hermione,

911
00:57:07.640 --> 00:57:12.050
does it change any other requirements of quantum computing?

912
00:57:12.080 --> 00:57:15.200
Like such as absolute zero temperature?

913
00:57:15.320 --> 00:57:18.830
<v 1>No,
no,
no,
no,
no.
It's just still operates at all.
Most proposals,</v>

914
00:57:18.900 --> 00:57:23.390
I'll pray to low temperature,
unfortunately.
Yeah.

915
00:57:24.160 --> 00:57:28.430
But a approach could work at room temperature if a room temperature

916
00:57:28.431 --> 00:57:33.430
superconductors discovered,
but that hasn't been discovered yet.
But we,

917
00:57:33.440 --> 00:57:37.640
we,
she had in mind that maybe for some very,
very hot computer station,

918
00:57:38.000 --> 00:57:41.330
if you will,
there's really a qualitative improvement.

919
00:57:41.390 --> 00:57:43.070
We can just call it to look in pitch.

920
00:57:45.160 --> 00:57:46.540
<v 2>Okay.
Well thank you so much.</v>

921
00:57:46.570 --> 00:57:51.570
[inaudible].
