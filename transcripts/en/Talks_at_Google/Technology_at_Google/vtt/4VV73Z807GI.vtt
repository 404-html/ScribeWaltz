1
00:00:08.690 --> 00:00:09.523
Okay.

2
00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:15.330
<v 0>Hello everyone.
It's so wonderful to be here.
Thank you for having me.</v>

3
00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:21.800
I'm going to start off with a story and it begins as all good stories do on

4
00:00:22.171 --> 00:00:23.004
Amtrak.

5
00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:28.230
So it was the end of 2016 and I was traveling from Boston to New York.

6
00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:33.510
I just spent Christmas with my partner's family and we were all still just

7
00:00:33.511 --> 00:00:35.700
processing the results of the November election.

8
00:00:36.990 --> 00:00:41.160
One of my good friends told me that I should pick a cause that I care deeply

9
00:00:41.161 --> 00:00:44.010
about and supported in a way that only I could.

10
00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:47.250
So I thought back to one of my childhood heroes,

11
00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:50.130
Rita Levi Montel cine,

12
00:00:50.790 --> 00:00:55.560
who discovered nerve growth factor in the 1940s or initial discovery wasn't at

13
00:00:55.561 --> 00:00:56.700
the University of Turin,

14
00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:00.600
but actually in a makeshift laboratory she'd set up in her bedroom after

15
00:01:00.601 --> 00:01:04.500
Mussolini had barred Jewish people from working in academic settings.

16
00:01:05.730 --> 00:01:10.350
I knew there were other women like her who had made significant improvements to

17
00:01:10.351 --> 00:01:13.110
their fields,
but I was drawing a blank.

18
00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:18.180
The only other name that came to mind was the legendary scientist,
Marie Curie.

19
00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:24.080
So I started beyond Curie as series of illustrations and stories that celebrates

20
00:01:25.111 --> 00:01:29.400
the rich history of women kicking ass in science,
technology,

21
00:01:29.730 --> 00:01:33.480
engineering and mathematics.
Women like Mario Murcia,

22
00:01:33.481 --> 00:01:35.160
Connie and Mary Golder Ross.

23
00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:40.140
I started it so that young women everywhere could stop wondering if they had the

24
00:01:40.141 --> 00:01:44.160
potential to make an impact in stem and instead start asking,

25
00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:46.050
why should we stop now?

26
00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:50.100
The project was funded by Kickstarter campaign,

27
00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:54.180
which attracted hundreds of backers,
parents,
teachers,

28
00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:55.381
engineers,

29
00:01:55.381 --> 00:02:00.090
and scientists who wanted the women in their lives to be inspired by that same

30
00:02:00.091 --> 00:02:04.170
legacy.
In partnership with the March for science organizers,

31
00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:08.840
I released a special series of posters that anyone could download and print for

32
00:02:08.850 --> 00:02:12.180
rally or protest in.
A couple of months later,

33
00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:16.530
I headed down to Washington d C along with thousands of others and we stood

34
00:02:16.531 --> 00:02:20.760
huddled under our umbrella is on that wet dreary day taking to the streets of

35
00:02:20.761 --> 00:02:25.761
the nation's Capitol to stand up for science and that's when I saw her,

36
00:02:26.070 --> 00:02:30.450
a woman carrying a huge bedazzle would be on Curie poster,
a Rosalind Franklin,

37
00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:33.300
the scientist who had made crucial contributions.

38
00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:37.920
The understanding of DNA double helix structure is the same poster that I had

39
00:02:37.921 --> 00:02:39.150
brought with me to the march.

40
00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:44.190
She told me that she was getting her phd and had flown into DC from South
Dakota.

41
00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:45.983
For her,

42
00:02:45.990 --> 00:02:50.700
the poster was a powerful reminder that women belong in the lab just as much as

43
00:02:50.701 --> 00:02:55.440
men do.
Now,
as I've continued to work on beyond Curie,

44
00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:59.110
I've gone deeper and deeper into the lives of these incredible women and their

45
00:02:59.111 --> 00:03:03.790
groundbreaking work.
How are they able to push through when others weren't?

46
00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:08.770
What methods do they use to gain new insights and get their work recognized in a

47
00:03:08.771 --> 00:03:10.210
male dominated field,

48
00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:15.550
and how can these lessons be transferred outside of the realm of deep scientific

49
00:03:15.551 --> 00:03:19.690
and engineering research?
Into the lives of the rest of us.
Today.

50
00:03:19.691 --> 00:03:23.500
I'm going to share with you the stories of four of these women featured in the

51
00:03:23.501 --> 00:03:24.760
beyond curious series,

52
00:03:25.510 --> 00:03:29.980
exploring how their work unfolded and a little bit more about their

53
00:03:29.981 --> 00:03:30.880
personalities.

54
00:03:31.690 --> 00:03:36.460
This first lesson is about what to do when you have a truly groundbreaking idea.

55
00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:43.230
We live in an era where innovators have brought brilliant and sometimes

56
00:03:43.231 --> 00:03:45.960
devastating inventions and breakthroughs into the world,

57
00:03:46.170 --> 00:03:49.560
but not all ideas are immediately ready for the limelight.

58
00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:54.540
So what do you do if you bury it?
Are you giving up?

59
00:03:54.990 --> 00:03:56.250
No one wants to be a quitter,

60
00:03:56.670 --> 00:04:00.060
but if you push for it as a lone voice in the wild,

61
00:04:00.450 --> 00:04:02.280
you might just get cast out and ignored,

62
00:04:02.610 --> 00:04:06.060
which means your work never gets the impact it deserves.

63
00:04:07.290 --> 00:04:08.123
<v 1>Okay?</v>

64
00:04:08.470 --> 00:04:11.170
<v 0>This is a story of staying in the game.</v>

65
00:04:13.730 --> 00:04:18.730
Barbara Mcclintock was born in 1902 she spent most of her childhood in Brooklyn

66
00:04:20.270 --> 00:04:25.270
and her parents early on noted her solitary and independent streak,

67
00:04:25.850 --> 00:04:27.170
discarding the name Eleanor,

68
00:04:27.470 --> 00:04:32.470
the name they had initially intended on giving her as as being too delicate and

69
00:04:32.661 --> 00:04:33.494
feminine.

70
00:04:33.830 --> 00:04:38.330
She found her love for science in high school and was accepted later into

71
00:04:38.331 --> 00:04:43.331
Cornell's College of agriculture where she earned a bachelor's and then a phd in

72
00:04:43.431 --> 00:04:47.570
botany focusing on maze.
That's the grain with a multicolored kernels,

73
00:04:47.571 --> 00:04:49.340
also known as Indian corn.

74
00:04:52.100 --> 00:04:57.100
So after postdocs at Caltech and the University of Missouri where she made

75
00:04:57.801 --> 00:05:02.801
crucial contributions to the understanding of genetic replication in Mays,

76
00:05:04.520 --> 00:05:09.520
she accepted a faculty position at Cold Springs Harbor in 1942 and it was there

77
00:05:09.710 --> 00:05:14.710
at this leading biomedical facility in upstate New York that she made her

78
00:05:16.251 --> 00:05:20.780
groundbreaking
discoveries in genetics.

79
00:05:24.850 --> 00:05:29.080
Now
it all started with a simple question.

80
00:05:29.500 --> 00:05:34.390
Why does maize has differently colored kernels?
Some of them are yellow,

81
00:05:34.450 --> 00:05:38.710
some of their but purple,
sometimes.
This is weird mosaic pattern.

82
00:05:39.460 --> 00:05:40.293
Why is that?

83
00:05:40.330 --> 00:05:45.330
The scientific consensus at the time was that a genetic replication and jeans

84
00:05:45.611 --> 00:05:47.020
were ordered in a fixed pattern.

85
00:05:47.021 --> 00:05:51.670
So that meant that theoretically from ear to ear may should have similar

86
00:05:51.671 --> 00:05:52.504
coloring.

87
00:05:53.500 --> 00:05:58.500
So Barbara developed some of these amazing x ray techniques to induce mutations

88
00:06:00.470 --> 00:06:05.210
in cells and she noticed that different segments of DNA would kind of jump

89
00:06:05.211 --> 00:06:07.010
around the chromosomes.
When this happened,

90
00:06:07.400 --> 00:06:11.180
she also noticed that other segments of DNA would turn genes on and off.

91
00:06:12.440 --> 00:06:17.440
Her findings led to a theory about the uneven coloring in maize kernels.

92
00:06:19.490 --> 00:06:24.490
So if a piece of DNA was dropped into a segment that coded for purple pigment,

93
00:06:25.490 --> 00:06:28.940
it might disrupt that pigmentation and cause a mosaic colonel.

94
00:06:29.570 --> 00:06:32.480
It was dropped into a segment that turn genes on and off.

95
00:06:32.600 --> 00:06:35.660
It might result in a non pigmented yellow kernel.

96
00:06:37.770 --> 00:06:41.550
Mcclintock was a highly respected scientists and her peers and botany

97
00:06:42.180 --> 00:06:45.150
appreciated the work that she was doing,
but other scientists,

98
00:06:45.810 --> 00:06:46.830
they thought she was crazy.

99
00:06:47.130 --> 00:06:50.940
They responded with puzzlement and even hostility as she described it.

100
00:06:51.840 --> 00:06:56.840
She gave a big talk in 1951 summarizing a paper that she had written for a major

101
00:06:58.291 --> 00:07:01.140
symposium.
The room goes dead silent,

102
00:07:02.250 --> 00:07:03.720
talk about a tough crowd,

103
00:07:05.760 --> 00:07:08.130
but it didn't bother her too much.
She said,

104
00:07:10.970 --> 00:07:15.170
she said,
it didn't bother me that much because when you know you're right,

105
00:07:15.260 --> 00:07:18.170
you know that sooner or later it'll come out in the wash.

106
00:07:19.490 --> 00:07:22.280
So she continues to publish her work on maize,

107
00:07:22.550 --> 00:07:25.190
but after years and years and years of resistance,

108
00:07:25.220 --> 00:07:26.960
she starts moving on to other areas.

109
00:07:27.500 --> 00:07:32.500
She does seminal work on evolutionary pathways of maize and she travels to

110
00:07:33.501 --> 00:07:36.050
central and South America to do this work.

111
00:07:37.620 --> 00:07:38.080
<v 1>Okay.</v>

112
00:07:38.080 --> 00:07:40.330
<v 0>At the same time,
the field of genetics moves forward.</v>

113
00:07:41.110 --> 00:07:46.110
Other scientists start to see this jumping gene phenomenon in bacteria and yeast

114
00:07:49.150 --> 00:07:51.970
also advances in technology improve,

115
00:07:52.480 --> 00:07:55.210
so now they're able to understand exactly what's happening.

116
00:07:55.240 --> 00:08:00.240
They realize that Maclyn talks weird corn breeding research is actually

117
00:08:00.611 --> 00:08:05.611
fundamental to genetics and it's really a foundation for all of these other

118
00:08:05.951 --> 00:08:10.951
fields and has implications for every biomedical field.

119
00:08:13.340 --> 00:08:15.290
She's the first person to win

120
00:08:16.850 --> 00:08:18.380
the MacArthur genius grant,

121
00:08:18.530 --> 00:08:21.680
the first woman to receive the National Medal of science,

122
00:08:22.790 --> 00:08:25.580
and finally,
after over 30 years,

123
00:08:26.790 --> 00:08:27.190
<v 1>okay,</v>

124
00:08:27.190 --> 00:08:30.280
<v 0>she's given the Nobel prize in physiology and medicine.</v>

125
00:08:31.420 --> 00:08:36.250
She is the first American woman to win an unshared Nobel prize in any category.

126
00:08:37.870 --> 00:08:41.140
She also gets a building named after her at cold spring harbor,

127
00:08:41.141 --> 00:08:41.974
which is cool too.

128
00:08:44.020 --> 00:08:44.640
<v 1>Okay,</v>

129
00:08:44.640 --> 00:08:49.640
<v 0>so McClintock isn't the only one who had to wait years to get her work</v>

130
00:08:49.891 --> 00:08:50.724
recognized.

131
00:08:54.150 --> 00:08:56.730
In 2017 the me too movement

132
00:08:57.570 --> 00:09:01.920
<v 1>brought down Harvey Weinstein and reverberated across the country and around the</v>

133
00:09:01.921 --> 00:09:05.430
world irreversibly changing the conversation around sexual harassment,

134
00:09:05.940 --> 00:09:10.410
but its origins began more than a decade earlier with the work of social

135
00:09:10.411 --> 00:09:13.710
activist and community organizer,
Toronto Burke,

136
00:09:14.760 --> 00:09:17.100
born in the Bronx to a low income household.

137
00:09:17.101 --> 00:09:21.150
She experienced sexual violence as a girl and young woman.

138
00:09:21.780 --> 00:09:26.780
In 2003 she started a nonprofit called just be that developed programming for

139
00:09:28.020 --> 00:09:32.670
young black girls and teens to succeed socially and professionally.

140
00:09:35.330 --> 00:09:37.100
<v 0>She first used the phrase,
me too,</v>

141
00:09:37.280 --> 00:09:42.280
on my space as part of the campaign to promote empowerment through empathy

142
00:09:45.260 --> 00:09:47.360
amongst survivors of sexual abuse.

143
00:09:49.250 --> 00:09:54.250
This campaign became so important to her that in 2008 she renamed her nonprofit.

144
00:09:55.790 --> 00:09:56.623
Me Too.

145
00:09:58.120 --> 00:10:03.120
She continued this community work traveling to Brooklyn and Selma.

146
00:10:04.600 --> 00:10:05.270
<v 1>Okay.</v>

147
00:10:05.270 --> 00:10:08.690
<v 0>And then on October 15th,</v>

148
00:10:08.690 --> 00:10:13.690
2017 Alyssa Milano posted on Twitter about me too for the first time and a

149
00:10:14.500 --> 00:10:19.070
received 24,000 retweets and set off a tidal wave that continues to this day.

150
00:10:20.900 --> 00:10:21.381
Later on,

151
00:10:21.381 --> 00:10:26.381
Malano followed up that tweet crediting Burke with her earlier use of the phrase

152
00:10:27.050 --> 00:10:30.230
and her longstanding efforts to support survivors of sexual abuse.

153
00:10:31.190 --> 00:10:35.150
Trying to Burke went on to be named one of Time magazine's silence breakers,

154
00:10:35.180 --> 00:10:39.950
which time magazine named 2017 person of the year and she was this year's

155
00:10:39.951 --> 00:10:44.540
commencement speaker at U Penn's School of social policy and practice

156
00:10:46.400 --> 00:10:48.140
McClintock toxin stories.

157
00:10:48.410 --> 00:10:53.120
They share PLLs including their initial rise in the field.

158
00:10:53.840 --> 00:10:55.760
Burke's early May.
It's work,
excuse me,

159
00:10:55.910 --> 00:11:00.910
Maclyn talks early mates work was considered first rate and Burke had started

160
00:11:01.671 --> 00:11:06.650
her community activism as a young girl and continued at wherever she went.

161
00:11:07.550 --> 00:11:11.030
They also both had a breakthrough idea from McClintock.

162
00:11:11.270 --> 00:11:16.270
It was that genetic regulation could be controlled for Burke.

163
00:11:16.730 --> 00:11:21.730
It was that one of the ways to help survivors heal and communicate the awful

164
00:11:22.761 --> 00:11:27.470
prevalence of sexual abuse is to share one's own story.

165
00:11:29.090 --> 00:11:33.770
And for both of them,
it took years of working on other things,

166
00:11:33.771 --> 00:11:38.240
putting their initial idea side and waiting until the world was ready for them

167
00:11:38.241 --> 00:11:39.890
to get the recognition they deserved.

168
00:11:44.420 --> 00:11:47.750
It takes some time for ideas to permeate the world.
And yeah,

169
00:11:47.810 --> 00:11:50.870
it probably was much harder for them because they were women,

170
00:11:52.160 --> 00:11:56.530
but by their mark and staying in the game,
their fields,

171
00:11:56.620 --> 00:12:01.150
we're able to recognize the importance of their contributions.

172
00:12:04.030 --> 00:12:07.660
The next lesson that I think we can learn from leading scientists is that the

173
00:12:07.661 --> 00:12:11.680
world needs more champions.
Women are often given the advice,

174
00:12:12.070 --> 00:12:14.650
go find a mentor,
someone who's

175
00:12:16.630 --> 00:12:21.630
had some more years on you in the field and can offer advice or approaches to

176
00:12:21.701 --> 00:12:22.534
your work.

177
00:12:23.260 --> 00:12:28.260
But having a mentor isn't enough women and ambitious people of every stripe need

178
00:12:29.951 --> 00:12:30.784
champions

179
00:12:32.320 --> 00:12:35.230
and the sheriffs way to understand the difference between a mentor and a

180
00:12:35.231 --> 00:12:40.231
champion is to look at Elizabeth Blackburn and Carol Greider.

181
00:12:42.280 --> 00:12:47.280
So in the late 1970s and early eighties the field of molecular biology was

182
00:12:49.451 --> 00:12:52.120
brimming with excitement.
There are lots of advances being made,

183
00:12:52.390 --> 00:12:55.240
including the discovery of telomeres,

184
00:12:56.050 --> 00:13:00.280
which are repeating segments at the ends of chromosomes that essentially protect

185
00:13:00.281 --> 00:13:05.170
them and keep them from injecting that or erroneous DNA during replication.

186
00:13:06.940 --> 00:13:08.950
Elizabeth Blackburn was a postdoc at the time.

187
00:13:09.130 --> 00:13:11.470
She was doing early work on Telomeres,

188
00:13:11.500 --> 00:13:16.500
actually studying pond scum because it was cheap and readily available.

189
00:13:17.560 --> 00:13:19.960
And because,
uh,

190
00:13:20.200 --> 00:13:23.350
cellular replication is generally highly conserved,

191
00:13:23.351 --> 00:13:28.351
which means it's the same and pond scum and mammals and plants and even humans.

192
00:13:30.250 --> 00:13:35.250
So she sets up her lab at UC Berkeley and in 1983 she recruits a young

193
00:13:36.041 --> 00:13:38.980
university of San Diego,
biology neighbor,

194
00:13:39.010 --> 00:13:41.620
major named Carol Greider.

195
00:13:42.970 --> 00:13:45.310
So grinder had done great in Undergrad.

196
00:13:45.580 --> 00:13:50.580
She was already an accomplished researcher in her own right and knew her way

197
00:13:50.951 --> 00:13:54.550
around the lab,
but she suffered from dyslexia,

198
00:13:54.551 --> 00:13:56.050
which meant she didn't really test well.

199
00:13:56.740 --> 00:13:59.440
So when it came time to interview for a phd programs,

200
00:13:59.441 --> 00:14:04.270
she only got offers at two places to interview and one of them was UC Berkeley.

201
00:14:04.660 --> 00:14:07.720
After meeting with the team,
she said,
you know what?

202
00:14:07.721 --> 00:14:11.260
This seems like a great place to do research and a great group of people to work

203
00:14:11.261 --> 00:14:16.000
with.
She was all in.
She worked 12 hour days in the lab,

204
00:14:16.510 --> 00:14:20.530
learned all different kinds of techniques on the fly and engage in a lot of

205
00:14:20.531 --> 00:14:25.531
intense intellectual discussion with Blackburg do oh,

206
00:14:25.781 --> 00:14:29.020
hypothesize that there was some kind of enzyme,
a protein,

207
00:14:29.021 --> 00:14:34.021
and probably that would regulate this cellular replication and control

208
00:14:37.120 --> 00:14:40.840
telomeres.
Finally,
after many,

209
00:14:40.841 --> 00:14:42.760
many tests around Christmas time,

210
00:14:43.180 --> 00:14:48.180
Carol comes rushing in with the results of an experiment that show an enzyme

211
00:14:49.540 --> 00:14:51.770
that could potentially be the one that they had hot pot.

212
00:14:51.771 --> 00:14:56.771
The sized Blackburn remembers this exact moment and thinking,

213
00:14:57.350 --> 00:14:59.300
wow,
this is something big.

214
00:15:02.530 --> 00:15:06.640
So eventually Carol moves on,
she gets her phd,

215
00:15:07.440 --> 00:15:09.850
goes on to teach at cold springs harbor,

216
00:15:09.970 --> 00:15:14.970
and then gets a faculty position at Johns Hopkins where she still does research

217
00:15:15.280 --> 00:15:16.720
and teaches today.

218
00:15:18.700 --> 00:15:23.700
Then in 2009 she Blackburn and a third scientists who had worked on the early

219
00:15:24.701 --> 00:15:28.060
work of Tila,
mirrors,
won the Nobel prize in physiology and medicine.

220
00:15:31.140 --> 00:15:34.770
Blackburn wasn't a mentor for Grider.
She was her champion.

221
00:15:35.340 --> 00:15:36.360
She pushed grinder.

222
00:15:36.840 --> 00:15:41.840
She made sure that they connected on a daily basis.

223
00:15:42.150 --> 00:15:44.490
This is uncommon and Grad programs,
usually

224
00:15:46.200 --> 00:15:50.490
principal investigators touch base with their graduate students maybe once a

225
00:15:50.491 --> 00:15:51.324
month,

226
00:15:51.660 --> 00:15:56.550
blackboard and also made sure that Carol got credit for the discovery that she

227
00:15:56.551 --> 00:15:56.910
made,

228
00:15:56.910 --> 00:16:01.260
even though she was only one year out of Undergrad and a very young researcher,

229
00:16:01.770 --> 00:16:06.770
something that Jocelyn Bell Burnell never got from her principal investigator.

230
00:16:08.160 --> 00:16:12.300
Jocelyn discovered the first bull SARS,
but instead of sharing credit,

231
00:16:12.301 --> 00:16:14.430
her principal investigator took the credit.

232
00:16:17.440 --> 00:16:18.820
So the lesson is to

233
00:16:20.500 --> 00:16:24.580
find champions and be a champion for others when you can,

234
00:16:25.510 --> 00:16:26.890
but easier said than done,
right.

235
00:16:27.940 --> 00:16:30.850
When we all love to have a brilliant influential,

236
00:16:31.090 --> 00:16:35.380
encouraging leader who was helping us do highly visible and impactful work of

237
00:16:35.381 --> 00:16:38.680
course.
But how does this actually happen in practice?

238
00:16:39.730 --> 00:16:43.570
One of the best examples is from the Obama administration.

239
00:16:45.230 --> 00:16:45.911
Couple of years ago,

240
00:16:45.911 --> 00:16:50.911
the Washington Post did a piece on Obama's first term when two thirds of his

241
00:16:52.511 --> 00:16:54.040
aids were men.

242
00:16:56.390 --> 00:16:56.890
<v 1>Okay.</v>

243
00:16:56.890 --> 00:17:01.890
<v 0>So women had to elbow their way to get into meetings and when they were there</v>

244
00:17:02.200 --> 00:17:04.330
they were talked over and ignored.

245
00:17:05.560 --> 00:17:09.400
So the women got together and developed something called amplification,

246
00:17:09.490 --> 00:17:11.620
where when a woman made a key point,

247
00:17:11.890 --> 00:17:15.970
other women would repeat it and then give that woman credit.

248
00:17:16.750 --> 00:17:21.750
This had the dual impact of making sure that their ideas and their voices were

249
00:17:22.601 --> 00:17:23.200
heard,

250
00:17:23.200 --> 00:17:27.670
but also it made sure that the men couldn't take credit for their ideas and it

251
00:17:27.671 --> 00:17:28.504
worked.

252
00:17:28.630 --> 00:17:33.220
We saw Obama calling more and more directly on the women in those meetings.

253
00:17:36.850 --> 00:17:37.683
<v 1>Now</v>

254
00:17:39.290 --> 00:17:41.780
<v 0>my last story comes from Asia,</v>

255
00:17:41.930 --> 00:17:46.930
which is fitting because I owe the opportunity to give this talk to the agent

256
00:17:47.091 --> 00:17:47.924
Google network.

257
00:17:50.680 --> 00:17:55.680
You too is a Chinese pharmaceutical chemist who led a team that developed a

258
00:18:01.181 --> 00:18:06.181
breakthrough cure for tropical malaria for which she won the Nobel Prize in 2015

259
00:18:10.720 --> 00:18:11.553
<v 1>okay.</v>

260
00:18:12.870 --> 00:18:14.800
<v 0>You,
you two grew up in Ningbo,</v>

261
00:18:14.890 --> 00:18:19.890
which is about 120 miles south of Shanghai and as a young child she developed a

262
00:18:23.501 --> 00:18:24.970
serious case of tuberculosis,

263
00:18:24.971 --> 00:18:29.350
which actually inspired to go inspired her to go into medical research.

264
00:18:32.520 --> 00:18:36.270
Now she studied as the Beijing University,
uh,

265
00:18:36.271 --> 00:18:41.271
school of pharmacology and graduated in 1955 a couple of years later

266
00:18:43.530 --> 00:18:44.363
in 1960,

267
00:18:45.400 --> 00:18:50.400
the north Vietnamese leader Holcim in appeal to his friend and ally,

268
00:18:51.270 --> 00:18:52.680
the Chinese premier for help

269
00:18:54.310 --> 00:18:59.310
North Vietnamese soldiers were dropping like flies from tropical and malaria.

270
00:19:00.350 --> 00:19:03.830
And the current care chloroquine nine was ineffective.

271
00:19:04.670 --> 00:19:06.560
It just so happened that in southern China,

272
00:19:07.700 --> 00:19:10.100
lots of citizens who dying from malaria as well.

273
00:19:10.190 --> 00:19:15.190
So the Chinese premier ass mouth to dome to set up a secret government program

274
00:19:16.310 --> 00:19:19.040
called project five 23 to discover a cure.

275
00:19:22.380 --> 00:19:26.970
It's not really that original of a name since it's after the date of its

276
00:19:26.971 --> 00:19:31.020
founding.
May 23rd,
1967 regardless,

277
00:19:31.290 --> 00:19:34.380
they recruited 500 scientists from all over the country,

278
00:19:34.620 --> 00:19:38.730
different labs and institutions to participate in the fight against malaria.

279
00:19:39.500 --> 00:19:42.000
You to joins.
In 1969,

280
00:19:42.690 --> 00:19:45.320
she actually had to put her young daughter in a nursery.

281
00:19:45.380 --> 00:19:50.380
She traveled to southern China to investigate what was going on.

282
00:19:52.960 --> 00:19:56.140
So around the world,
other scientists are getting involved.

283
00:19:56.590 --> 00:20:01.000
They've tested over 240,000 different compounds for a cure to no avail.

284
00:20:02.150 --> 00:20:02.580
<v 1>Okay,</v>

285
00:20:02.580 --> 00:20:07.580
<v 0>so you go to decides to retread some old ground and go back and look at</v>

286
00:20:08.011 --> 00:20:09.330
traditional Chinese medicine.

287
00:20:09.840 --> 00:20:13.200
She travels around the country talking to different Chinese medicine

288
00:20:13.201 --> 00:20:14.040
practitioners,

289
00:20:14.160 --> 00:20:17.790
compiling all of our notes and all of this research and a big notebook.

290
00:20:19.860 --> 00:20:24.860
By early 1971 she and her team had tested over 2000 recipes from Chinese

291
00:20:26.461 --> 00:20:27.294
medicine,

292
00:20:27.330 --> 00:20:32.330
had extracted about 380 herbal extracts from 200 herbs and tested it on mice.

293
00:20:35.210 --> 00:20:36.043
<v 1>Then</v>

294
00:20:38.600 --> 00:20:43.600
<v 0>they found out that there was one compound from the sweet wormwood plant that</v>

295
00:20:44.070 --> 00:20:45.770
seemed like it might be a contender.

296
00:20:48.100 --> 00:20:51.670
This compound was known to help with intermittent fevers,

297
00:20:51.671 --> 00:20:54.520
was a characteristic of malaria and also

298
00:20:56.080 --> 00:20:58.450
it proved to inhibit parasite growth.

299
00:20:59.990 --> 00:21:00.823
<v 1>Yeah,</v>

300
00:21:00.900 --> 00:21:02.850
<v 0>so after testing it on mice,
you,</v>

301
00:21:02.851 --> 00:21:06.600
you two steps forward as the very first human test subject.

302
00:21:06.840 --> 00:21:10.920
She actually tested it on herself,
which is incredible.
Fortunately,

303
00:21:11.190 --> 00:21:14.820
it's safe for humans.
It works.
Patient trials continue,

304
00:21:15.270 --> 00:21:16.680
which proved highly successful,

305
00:21:17.130 --> 00:21:21.840
but no one in the world knows about this research because of the cultural

306
00:21:21.841 --> 00:21:25.770
revolution.
And because this is a highly secret military project,

307
00:21:26.550 --> 00:21:31.030
but once these international relations reopens you,

308
00:21:31.050 --> 00:21:36.050
Youtube is asked to present the findings of project five 23 to the World Health

309
00:21:36.780 --> 00:21:41.490
Organization.
After that,
more folks start to use artemisinin,

310
00:21:41.640 --> 00:21:44.070
which is what they ended up calling this compound.

311
00:21:45.900 --> 00:21:49.050
And it's one of the frontline tools against malaria.

312
00:21:50.880 --> 00:21:55.880
So between 2020 12 the global incidence and malaria drops 25% and the global

313
00:21:58.231 --> 00:22:03.231
mortality rate from malaria drops 42% and our recent estimate,

314
00:22:03.960 --> 00:22:08.960
it said that her discovery of Artemisinin has saved hundreds of millions of

315
00:22:09.571 --> 00:22:12.530
lives.
Pretty incredible,
right?

316
00:22:13.970 --> 00:22:18.970
So another woman who's not so afraid to retread old ground to discover new

317
00:22:19.131 --> 00:22:23.390
insights is former Ge,
vice chair Beth Comstock.

318
00:22:25.460 --> 00:22:30.460
Now Comstock started her career at NBC News as a journalist in Washington DC a

319
00:22:33.440 --> 00:22:33.500
couple of years later.

320
00:22:33.500 --> 00:22:38.500
She gets the opportunity to travel to New York for new job opportunities,

321
00:22:38.931 --> 00:22:41.990
despite having a small child and being a single parent,

322
00:22:41.991 --> 00:22:46.250
she takes the leap and this move to the big city,
pays off,

323
00:22:46.251 --> 00:22:48.110
she gets opportunities at CNN.

324
00:22:48.650 --> 00:22:53.650
And then at CBS running east coast PR for the classiest network in the country.

325
00:22:58.250 --> 00:23:00.530
Then in 1993 she gets a call

326
00:23:02.060 --> 00:23:03.470
to return back to NBC.

327
00:23:03.590 --> 00:23:07.610
They have an opening for the vice president of media relations,

328
00:23:08.750 --> 00:23:13.750
but the problem is is that recently NBC just got outed for running a fake news

329
00:23:14.121 --> 00:23:16.160
story.
Morale was in the toilet,

330
00:23:17.510 --> 00:23:19.490
resistance to her taking this job,

331
00:23:19.520 --> 00:23:22.340
even considering it started immediately after she got the call,

332
00:23:23.240 --> 00:23:28.240
but she knew that in her gut this was the job for her to take something was

333
00:23:29.061 --> 00:23:34.061
calling Comstock back to NBC and she ended up following her gut and being

334
00:23:34.371 --> 00:23:37.070
correct.
They gave her a lot of latitude.

335
00:23:37.520 --> 00:23:42.290
She was able to experiment and try new things and two years later she launched

336
00:23:42.291 --> 00:23:47.291
Msnbc with Hakka with the help of Welsh and Bill Gates and it's now the second

337
00:23:49.071 --> 00:23:51.500
most watched channel on cable news,

338
00:23:54.710 --> 00:23:57.830
learning to retread old ground to find new insights.

339
00:23:58.910 --> 00:24:02.240
It's a lesson that I use myself in developing beyond Curie.

340
00:24:04.700 --> 00:24:06.530
I would never have known that.

341
00:24:07.490 --> 00:24:12.410
My Fourth Grade Book Report on Rita Levi model cine would be the spark for a

342
00:24:12.411 --> 00:24:17.411
project that would have such a global response lead to a main stage Ted talk and

343
00:24:17.691 --> 00:24:22.691
also lead to a whole highway tunnel dedicated to women and stem.

344
00:24:25.070 --> 00:24:28.370
In fact,
I didn't even think I'd still be working on beyond Curie,

345
00:24:29.060 --> 00:24:34.060
but I'm glad that I am beyond Curie is about discovering our heroes because when

346
00:24:36.141 --> 00:24:38.030
we're able to connect with greatness,

347
00:24:38.420 --> 00:24:42.470
we come to see that it is not some distant unreachable place,

348
00:24:43.010 --> 00:24:47.840
but a long body of work force through perseverance,
love,
and courage.

349
00:24:48.470 --> 00:24:50.210
Because when we truly know our past,

350
00:24:50.300 --> 00:24:54.710
we can reclaim our present and when we hold the present in our hands,

351
00:24:55.100 --> 00:24:59.330
the future is ours to shape.
Thanks so much for listening.

352
00:25:04.660 --> 00:25:05.280
<v 1>I got it.</v>

353
00:25:05.280 --> 00:25:07.080
<v 0>We can open up to questions</v>

354
00:25:08.180 --> 00:25:11.230
<v 2>and we'll just do maybe multiple references to cold springs harbor.</v>

355
00:25:11.580 --> 00:25:16.180
What does that go?
Incidence.
So did you,
was there some reason for that?

356
00:25:16.940 --> 00:25:19.790
<v 0>Well,
it's a leading biomedical institution,</v>

357
00:25:19.791 --> 00:25:24.350
so a lot of people who have won the Nobel Prize did work there.

358
00:25:24.410 --> 00:25:25.370
But,
uh,

359
00:25:26.180 --> 00:25:29.870
I guess in this talk purely by coincidence,

360
00:25:31.090 --> 00:25:31.580
<v 2>um,</v>

361
00:25:31.580 --> 00:25:36.580
could you talk more about the format of this project beyond Curie and you know,

362
00:25:37.160 --> 00:25:37.670
how,

363
00:25:37.670 --> 00:25:42.670
how can girls and women access it and connect to these messages that you're

364
00:25:42.681 --> 00:25:43.514
trying to convey?

365
00:25:43.830 --> 00:25:44.101
<v 0>Uh,</v>

366
00:25:44.101 --> 00:25:49.101
so it lives online at [inaudible] dot com we do a lot of exhibits around the

367
00:25:49.111 --> 00:25:52.380
country and around the world that shows these portraits,

368
00:25:52.680 --> 00:25:57.680
gives a small little description of what the scientists and technologists have

369
00:25:58.111 --> 00:25:59.250
contributed to the world.

370
00:25:59.310 --> 00:26:03.720
And also there's an ar app in the apple and android store.

371
00:26:07.460 --> 00:26:08.293
<v 1>Thank you.
Sure.</v>

372
00:26:09.360 --> 00:26:12.340
<v 0>Oh,
there's also a Kickstarter that we're running it right now.
Uh,</v>

373
00:26:12.660 --> 00:26:17.660
that's holiday cards in case you're interested in sharing these women for the

374
00:26:18.271 --> 00:26:19.104
holidays.

375
00:26:21.560 --> 00:26:22.070
<v 2>Um,</v>

376
00:26:22.070 --> 00:26:25.850
have you considered working with schools or are you working with schools around

377
00:26:25.851 --> 00:26:28.790
the country,
you know,
to encourage,
um,
you know,

378
00:26:29.180 --> 00:26:34.180
girls being made aware of and Gore girls and boys.

379
00:26:34.310 --> 00:26:35.143
Really,

380
00:26:35.220 --> 00:26:38.880
<v 0>that's a great idea.
We are working with several schools.
Um,</v>

381
00:26:39.120 --> 00:26:42.270
it's kind of come about organically.
Um,

382
00:26:42.680 --> 00:26:47.680
we field a lot of inbound from schools and we donate a lot of sets of these

383
00:26:48.270 --> 00:26:52.720
posters.
And,
um,
little wall decals for schools.
Uh,

384
00:26:52.740 --> 00:26:55.440
but if you have other suggestions,
I'm definitely open.

385
00:26:56.590 --> 00:26:57.423
<v 1>Sure.</v>

386
00:26:58.690 --> 00:27:03.640
<v 3>Um,
can you share a little more about your own journey from like being a</v>

387
00:27:03.641 --> 00:27:08.641
neuroscientist to coming up with these works of art and like how that took off

388
00:27:09.731 --> 00:27:13.000
and turned into beyond curious like an organization and everything?

389
00:27:13.220 --> 00:27:14.480
<v 0>Sure.
Um,</v>

390
00:27:14.840 --> 00:27:19.840
so I realized that I was better at communicating research and communicating

391
00:27:20.181 --> 00:27:24.050
science then actually doing the science and I could make more impact there.

392
00:27:24.080 --> 00:27:29.080
So I got my MFA at Pratt and after that I bounced around different art director

393
00:27:31.071 --> 00:27:32.600
and creative director positions.

394
00:27:32.690 --> 00:27:37.690
And then I got the opportunity to do something called the Ted residency,

395
00:27:38.000 --> 00:27:43.000
which is an incubator program where you have some sort of idea worth spreading

396
00:27:43.610 --> 00:27:45.170
that you apply with.

397
00:27:45.171 --> 00:27:48.680
Mine was that design can shine a light on breakthroughs happening in science.

398
00:27:48.860 --> 00:27:53.090
And I actually incubated another project,
not be on Curie there.

399
00:27:53.840 --> 00:27:58.840
It's a program that pairs scientists and designers to cocreate works of art and

400
00:27:58.971 --> 00:28:03.380
design that translate research and we put up pop up exhibits all over the

401
00:28:03.381 --> 00:28:07.070
country and work with different institutions,
uh,

402
00:28:07.400 --> 00:28:11.570
beyond curious started because I was trying to find a way to

403
00:28:12.480 --> 00:28:13.210
<v 1>okay,</v>

404
00:28:13.210 --> 00:28:16.570
<v 0>give back after the election and support causes that I believed in.</v>

405
00:28:16.660 --> 00:28:21.160
And supporting women in stem is one of the ones that I believe in a lot.

406
00:28:21.820 --> 00:28:26.820
So I started it as a little digital project that I wanted to put online.

407
00:28:28.301 --> 00:28:29.590
I thought,
you know what?

408
00:28:29.591 --> 00:28:33.700
There are so many women that people don't know about,

409
00:28:33.880 --> 00:28:36.910
never heard their names before,
they've probably heard of their discoveries,

410
00:28:36.911 --> 00:28:38.410
but never knew that women made them.

411
00:28:38.950 --> 00:28:42.430
So why don't we create a format that's colorful,

412
00:28:42.431 --> 00:28:47.050
that's visually appealing so that people's attentions are grabbed and then we

413
00:28:47.051 --> 00:28:48.940
can roll the stories into this experience.

414
00:28:50.080 --> 00:28:54.670
I did not expect for it to be picked up by fast company and a bunch of other

415
00:28:54.671 --> 00:28:56.500
different media networks,

416
00:28:56.501 --> 00:29:00.610
which is kind of how it grew to a global phenomenon.

417
00:29:00.790 --> 00:29:04.900
And I've just been continuing to work on it,
adding scientists to it.

418
00:29:05.410 --> 00:29:06.243
Um,

419
00:29:08.210 --> 00:29:13.210
and we try very hard to go into different countries and work with different

420
00:29:13.851 --> 00:29:18.851
institutions to figure out what's a way that we can bring beyond Curie there.

421
00:29:21.060 --> 00:29:24.950
<v 3>Thanks so much.
[inaudible].</v>
