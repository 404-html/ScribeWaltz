1
00:00:11.170 --> 00:00:13.680
All right.
So good morning everyone.
Thank you for,
uh,

2
00:00:13.720 --> 00:00:18.040
for joining me and thank you Google for hosting visa presentation.

3
00:00:18.430 --> 00:00:22.930
Um,
today I want to tell you a little bit about what happened when I decided to,

4
00:00:22.950 --> 00:00:24.610
um,
open open source,

5
00:00:24.611 --> 00:00:28.840
my book in how you can leverage the same approach to,
uh,

6
00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:32.920
publish your own book.
Um,
so as a handyman mentioned,

7
00:00:32.921 --> 00:00:34.330
my name is Francesco Marconi.

8
00:00:34.331 --> 00:00:39.200
I'm a media strategies in recently published leave like fiction,
um,

9
00:00:39.430 --> 00:00:43.790
30 days to become the author of your own life story.
Uh,

10
00:00:44.020 --> 00:00:48.430
the book is essentially an interactive guide on how to find purpose,

11
00:00:48.431 --> 00:00:53.180
creativity,
and inspiration through storytelling.
Uh,

12
00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:55.280
the organizing principle of,

13
00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:58.820
of this book is called engage,
uh,

14
00:00:58.840 --> 00:01:03.730
because this book is about how to engage with yourself in how to engage with the

15
00:01:03.731 --> 00:01:06.400
things around you that inspire you.
Uh,

16
00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:11.290
any sauce with the acronym for each of the six parts that comprise the book in

17
00:01:11.291 --> 00:01:14.560
those six parts are,
um,
explore your meaning,

18
00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:19.900
narrow your goals,
uh,
generate a plan,
anticipate roadblocks,

19
00:01:19.930 --> 00:01:22.660
gain persistence in elevate yourself.

20
00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:29.040
So the book is comprised of fat of six major sections with the five mini

21
00:01:30.431 --> 00:01:33.910
chapters each.
Um,
so total 30 mini chapters,

22
00:01:34.150 --> 00:01:38.530
one for each day of the month.
So it's designed to be a month long program.

23
00:01:39.070 --> 00:01:40.870
Um,
in these chapters,

24
00:01:40.871 --> 00:01:44.500
tell the an interesting story of an [inaudible] people,

25
00:01:44.501 --> 00:01:47.530
including artists,
entrepreneurs,
thinkers,

26
00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:49.970
authors in and veal,
um,

27
00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:53.050
the strategy behind their accomplishments.

28
00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:58.120
In finally each brief question,
each brief section concludes,

29
00:01:58.121 --> 00:02:03.121
we think any interactive exercise so the reader can apply what they just learned

30
00:02:04.511 --> 00:02:07.960
or what they just,
um,
and reflected on.

31
00:02:09.730 --> 00:02:14.730
So one of the questions that I get the most when I'm presenting my book,

32
00:02:15.191 --> 00:02:16.500
we're talking about it.
Um,

33
00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:21.220
it's not necessarily about the contents in the book because people end up

34
00:02:21.221 --> 00:02:22.520
reading it,
uh,

35
00:02:22.570 --> 00:02:27.570
but it's more about the process or the approach that I took to publish the book.

36
00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:35.280
In fact,
someone recently told me that a book is like the new business card.

37
00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:38.520
So you need the book,
uh,
in our to,
uh,

38
00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:40.540
transacting in the business world.

39
00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:45.930
So I want to tell you today how you can write your own book using this

40
00:02:46.061 --> 00:02:51.040
methodology that I,
um,
that I follow for a four.
Leave like fiction.

41
00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:52.900
Before I do that,

42
00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:57.930
I just wanted to guide you through how traditional traditional book publishing

43
00:02:58.391 --> 00:03:01.920
works.
Uh,
any something like this.
Um,

44
00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:06.640
the author writes a sample or a sample chapter in a proposal,

45
00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:09.540
partners with a literary agent,
um,

46
00:03:09.730 --> 00:03:14.230
who helps the author broker the deal.
We the we,
the publishing house.

47
00:03:14.231 --> 00:03:15.250
And then finally,

48
00:03:15.251 --> 00:03:20.251
much later the book is released to the audiences and they read the book.

49
00:03:20.950 --> 00:03:23.530
So in these traditional approach,

50
00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:28.280
the reader is actually the last person to come into contact with,
uh,

51
00:03:28.300 --> 00:03:29.320
what he just created.

52
00:03:29.890 --> 00:03:34.090
And this is a great approach if you're already a well known person in and have a

53
00:03:34.091 --> 00:03:37.630
big following.
So if you're a former president,

54
00:03:37.631 --> 00:03:41.920
a famous chef and award winning author,
this is great for you.

55
00:03:42.190 --> 00:03:46.380
But if you're like me and he are just the irregular person,
um,

56
00:03:46.450 --> 00:03:47.860
you have to build interest in,

57
00:03:47.861 --> 00:03:52.240
you have to build an audience before you even think of,
of publishing a book.

58
00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:56.940
And that's where,
um,
a new approach comes handy,
uh,

59
00:03:56.950 --> 00:04:01.660
which I call iterative,
iterative approach.
And so for my book,

60
00:04:01.661 --> 00:04:06.010
I decided to flip the model,
start with the audience first,
um,

61
00:04:06.100 --> 00:04:10.890
and collect feedback from,
from people that read sort of the,

62
00:04:11.050 --> 00:04:16.050
the genesis of the book in take those insights to improve it,

63
00:04:16.210 --> 00:04:17.860
uh,
before,
uh,

64
00:04:17.890 --> 00:04:21.670
partnering with a book publisher to amplify distribution.

65
00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:23.260
And so this is,
um,

66
00:04:23.290 --> 00:04:28.060
for those of you who are familiar with a product development techniques like

67
00:04:28.061 --> 00:04:32.800
design thinking,
that's exactly what,
what I applied here.
So too,

68
00:04:32.860 --> 00:04:37.860
I want to share with you today how iterative published can help turn your ideas

69
00:04:37.901 --> 00:04:42.860
into a successful book.
Um,
and uh,
the book,
uh,
or,

70
00:04:42.870 --> 00:04:46.150
or the process starts precisely by,
uh,

71
00:04:46.180 --> 00:04:49.560
creating a proof of concept.
So,
um,

72
00:04:49.660 --> 00:04:51.430
an idea that you can test,

73
00:04:51.790 --> 00:04:55.240
receive feedback and then improve based on that.

74
00:04:56.470 --> 00:05:01.470
So the first step or the first thing to consider when you're developing your own

75
00:05:02.501 --> 00:05:05.620
book project,
he start with purpose,
um,

76
00:05:05.680 --> 00:05:07.850
event defying things that are important to you.

77
00:05:07.851 --> 00:05:12.400
So something that gives meaning to your life or a,
an ambition or,

78
00:05:12.401 --> 00:05:16.420
or a personal goal.
In my case,
uh,
when I was young,

79
00:05:16.421 --> 00:05:19.720
I have a dream of one day leaving in New York City.

80
00:05:20.170 --> 00:05:23.490
I'm in so much so that when I was 16,
um,

81
00:05:23.620 --> 00:05:27.940
I decided to buy a picture of New York City's of the New York City skyline,

82
00:05:28.270 --> 00:05:30.360
which you see on that picture,
um,

83
00:05:30.620 --> 00:05:35.620
on the slides and hang it above my,
my Beth,
this is my,
uh,

84
00:05:35.650 --> 00:05:40.570
my childhood,
a bathroom and I'm having this picture,
um,

85
00:05:40.720 --> 00:05:43.990
help me visualize a goal or an ambition that I have.

86
00:05:44.740 --> 00:05:49.490
And eventually I was fortunate to turn that dream into a reality when I got a,

87
00:05:49.630 --> 00:05:53.050
an internship here in New York City.

88
00:05:53.680 --> 00:05:58.120
But when I finally arrived to the city of dreams,
um,

89
00:05:58.280 --> 00:06:02.000
I really didn't know anyone.
I was just fresh out of college.

90
00:06:02.001 --> 00:06:03.500
I had no professional experience.

91
00:06:03.501 --> 00:06:08.501
So my way of coping with the situation was to write my observations of how

92
00:06:09.261 --> 00:06:13.790
people behave,
how the,
the small talk,
how they inspired others,

93
00:06:14.060 --> 00:06:16.940
how the managed people in.

94
00:06:16.941 --> 00:06:21.200
So I started translating these interesting observations that occurred around me

95
00:06:21.500 --> 00:06:26.280
into strategies that I could use in my own life.
Um,

96
00:06:26.320 --> 00:06:27.410
and so those notes,

97
00:06:27.411 --> 00:06:32.411
literal notes that I wrote became the raw material of what eventually became a

98
00:06:33.111 --> 00:06:34.160
leave like fiction.

99
00:06:34.940 --> 00:06:39.230
So a few tips here as you're getting started in your book project,

100
00:06:39.440 --> 00:06:44.330
find the personal,
um,
story that illustrates your,
your journey in,

101
00:06:44.331 --> 00:06:49.130
make it surprising in authentic.
So once you have figured out that,

102
00:06:49.220 --> 00:06:51.650
um,
your purpose,

103
00:06:52.580 --> 00:06:55.730
the second step is essentially to test,

104
00:06:56.480 --> 00:07:01.430
to test those ideas,
um,
at scale.
And so you,

105
00:07:01.450 --> 00:07:05.570
uh,
a good way of doing that,
these actually engineer a viral post.

106
00:07:05.930 --> 00:07:10.430
It might seem challenging,
but,
uh,
if you follow some,
uh,
some,

107
00:07:10.640 --> 00:07:15.020
some ideas here,
uh,
it's not,
it's not that difficult.
So,

108
00:07:15.730 --> 00:07:19.830
uh,
think about it.
A virus,
these viral PLO post or this,

109
00:07:20.390 --> 00:07:22.270
um,
summary of,

110
00:07:22.271 --> 00:07:27.271
of what your book wants you want to accomplish in your book as a teaser for what

111
00:07:27.621 --> 00:07:29.720
do you want to develop a,

112
00:07:29.721 --> 00:07:34.721
and this is important to have a early validation because you will be able to

113
00:07:34.851 --> 00:07:39.570
collect feedback and success metrics.
Uh,
for example,

114
00:07:39.571 --> 00:07:44.090
how many people share the article or liked it or how many views you got.

115
00:07:44.091 --> 00:07:48.050
So you can share those metrics within eventual publisher down the line.

116
00:07:48.680 --> 00:07:52.310
So as,
as I mentioned before,
I have,
um,

117
00:07:52.340 --> 00:07:57.340
developed a playbook of strategies from my observations on how to have better

118
00:07:57.381 --> 00:08:00.210
communication skills,
leadership,
um,

119
00:08:00.320 --> 00:08:04.940
influencing people and,
uh,
decided to take those notes that I,

120
00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:09.530
that I end written and put them on a online,
a shared document.

121
00:08:10.010 --> 00:08:14.360
And then what I did is that I sent it to 10 friends and I asked them to provide

122
00:08:14.361 --> 00:08:19.130
me feedback,
uh,
in most importantly to highlight the areas of,

123
00:08:19.131 --> 00:08:19.730
of,

124
00:08:19.730 --> 00:08:24.260
of that article or the blog posts that were the most unique,

125
00:08:24.290 --> 00:08:28.440
the most compelling.
And so I let the audience,
uh,

126
00:08:28.580 --> 00:08:33.140
although it was a small audience of 10 people initially participate in the

127
00:08:33.141 --> 00:08:36.200
creative process,
it's almost like testing your,

128
00:08:36.440 --> 00:08:41.390
your product before it's released to the public.
So I invited feedback,

129
00:08:41.630 --> 00:08:46.070
12 media Antifa by the,
the ingredients in those notes,
uh,

130
00:08:46.071 --> 00:08:51.071
that worked in and then use those to improve the overall narrative of,

131
00:08:52.320 --> 00:08:57.090
of the pilot or,
or the post that would originated blog,
the book.

132
00:08:57.720 --> 00:09:02.540
So when I find it finally published online,
um,
I used medium.
Uh,

133
00:09:02.620 --> 00:09:04.290
there aren't many other platforms.

134
00:09:04.560 --> 00:09:08.910
I knew that the version that I had just published was the best version that I

135
00:09:08.911 --> 00:09:11.940
could create because they've,
um,

136
00:09:12.360 --> 00:09:15.570
a lot of the elements that people enjoyed and,

137
00:09:15.600 --> 00:09:19.140
and highlighted as the most unique,
the most surprising.

138
00:09:19.770 --> 00:09:24.270
And eventually the,
the,
the,
the blog posts became a viral.

139
00:09:24.960 --> 00:09:29.960
So what happens when you are at the stage and final year of your viral blog

140
00:09:30.841 --> 00:09:34.110
posts,
which is almost a teaser for the book.
Um,

141
00:09:34.530 --> 00:09:37.290
you have an opportunity to build a support community,

142
00:09:37.291 --> 00:09:41.790
not only if those 10 initial people,
very west for feedback,
uh,

143
00:09:41.791 --> 00:09:46.620
but also people who,
uh,
you don't know yet and I've enjoyed reading your,

144
00:09:46.650 --> 00:09:48.420
your work.
Um,

145
00:09:48.480 --> 00:09:52.920
and it's important to connect with these readers because down the line they will

146
00:09:53.040 --> 00:09:58.040
play a very crucial role in promoting your book once it's out for a,

147
00:09:59.130 --> 00:10:02.040
for sale and end.
In addition to that,

148
00:10:02.070 --> 00:10:05.560
you may get lucky and get people you admire,
uh,

149
00:10:05.580 --> 00:10:09.390
to give you feedback and validation.
So in my case,
journalists,

150
00:10:09.391 --> 00:10:12.630
Katie Couric and author Neil Strauss,
uh,

151
00:10:12.660 --> 00:10:16.560
share their appreciation on Twitter and there was very important to me.

152
00:10:16.561 --> 00:10:20.460
And also when I was discussing it with potential publishers,

153
00:10:20.730 --> 00:10:25.290
I use the says,
uh,
um,
uh,
validation for,
uh,

154
00:10:25.320 --> 00:10:27.860
for the potential of the book.
So the,

155
00:10:27.861 --> 00:10:32.520
the thing to remember here is not to be afraid to reach out to the people that

156
00:10:32.550 --> 00:10:33.860
you don't know and that,
uh,

157
00:10:33.870 --> 00:10:37.400
enjoy their work because they will play a crucial role,
uh,

158
00:10:37.440 --> 00:10:41.760
in the promotion of the book.
Uh,
down the line.
The step,

159
00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:46.380
the fourth step that I want to share with you is how to amplify your audience.

160
00:10:46.381 --> 00:10:47.490
So remember,

161
00:10:47.491 --> 00:10:52.110
you have this initial interest around the viral viral posts.

162
00:10:52.111 --> 00:10:55.190
You have to extend your 15 minutes of fame,
uh,

163
00:10:55.230 --> 00:11:00.230
by publishing your ideas through different online publications.

164
00:11:00.930 --> 00:11:05.100
So in my case,
I have that successful blog post on medium in,

165
00:11:05.101 --> 00:11:09.480
I use the engagement metrics.
I actually took a screen shot of,

166
00:11:09.510 --> 00:11:12.900
of the metrics are many views on many shares in.

167
00:11:12.901 --> 00:11:16.040
I sent it to a few online magazines and uh,

168
00:11:16.170 --> 00:11:19.530
convinced them to republish,
um,
my,

169
00:11:19.560 --> 00:11:21.870
my article on their site.

170
00:11:22.470 --> 00:11:25.110
So eventually some of these brands,
um,

171
00:11:25.170 --> 00:11:28.200
invited me to continue as a contributor,
uh,

172
00:11:28.201 --> 00:11:32.500
which gave me a fantastic opportunity to get exposure to,
uh,

173
00:11:32.580 --> 00:11:33.690
many more people.

174
00:11:34.170 --> 00:11:38.420
So a few tips here as you're looking to expand your audience through,
um,

175
00:11:38.580 --> 00:11:43.410
different online magazines.
It's very important to start with a friend.

176
00:11:43.411 --> 00:11:45.510
We publisher,
maybe it's a,

177
00:11:45.511 --> 00:11:50.460
a friend who met before or it's someone who works at those magazines.

178
00:11:50.461 --> 00:11:54.550
You met Annie at an event,
and then once you secure the first,

179
00:11:54.820 --> 00:11:58.510
the first,
uh,
publishing partner,
um,
Ben,

180
00:11:58.511 --> 00:12:02.260
it's much easier to get others because you already have the validation of some

181
00:12:02.320 --> 00:12:05.960
of those brands.
And so you have to repeat the process,
um,

182
00:12:06.130 --> 00:12:10.300
and keep generating interest around your work.

183
00:12:11.550 --> 00:12:13.000
All right,
so,
um,

184
00:12:13.060 --> 00:12:17.440
this was the first stage of validating your concept,

185
00:12:17.441 --> 00:12:22.360
your book concept with the potential audience,
and then amplify it through,
uh,

186
00:12:22.390 --> 00:12:25.360
through different collaborations.
Uh,
now what,

187
00:12:25.361 --> 00:12:29.230
how the turn that audience in that interesting to a book veal.

188
00:12:31.720 --> 00:12:33.100
So,
um,

189
00:12:34.570 --> 00:12:38.710
since my book originated online as,
um,
as a,
as a,

190
00:12:38.920 --> 00:12:39.671
as a blog,

191
00:12:39.671 --> 00:12:44.671
it was important for me to give it some more structure in show publishers that,

192
00:12:45.310 --> 00:12:49.510
uh,
it was much more than a viral post.
Um,
and so I,

193
00:12:49.540 --> 00:12:54.460
what I did was to find an organizing principle.
As I mentioned at the beginning.

194
00:12:54.520 --> 00:12:57.580
Um,
that organizing principle is engaged,

195
00:12:57.581 --> 00:13:01.300
which is an acronym for each section of the book.
Um,

196
00:13:01.410 --> 00:13:05.920
and this acronym or this organizing principle is very important,
uh,

197
00:13:05.950 --> 00:13:10.840
because,
uh,
it helps you summarize the key ideas in your book.

198
00:13:10.900 --> 00:13:15.370
Um,
in my case there are related to storytelling,
inspiration,

199
00:13:15.371 --> 00:13:19.830
creativity,
strategy,
uh,
in so engage,
uh,

200
00:13:20.030 --> 00:13:22.570
links up to that very well.
Um,

201
00:13:22.600 --> 00:13:26.580
finding an acronym is ease is crucial because,
um,

202
00:13:26.680 --> 00:13:29.830
it makes your work more memorable for your readers,

203
00:13:30.160 --> 00:13:35.140
but also it differentiates it from any other books or publisher might be

204
00:13:35.410 --> 00:13:39.730
evaluating once you presented to them.
All right.

205
00:13:39.731 --> 00:13:44.670
So step six,
um,
is,
is very important,
uh,

206
00:13:44.780 --> 00:13:48.880
particularly nonfiction books,
which is the case of,
of live like fiction,

207
00:13:49.240 --> 00:13:53.890
uh,
is to make them a more,
um,
uh,

208
00:13:54.280 --> 00:13:55.660
two sided experience.

209
00:13:55.661 --> 00:14:00.340
So not only the reader is going through the,

210
00:14:00.510 --> 00:14:04.150
the stories in the book,
but they are also taking action.
Uh,

211
00:14:04.210 --> 00:14:08.870
my approach to find inspiration to turn some of the,
the,

212
00:14:08.871 --> 00:14:12.280
the stories in the book into potential,
um,

213
00:14:12.340 --> 00:14:16.480
exercises was to actually run offline workshops.

214
00:14:16.481 --> 00:14:21.130
And he's here a picture there,
uh,
where I'm running a workshop at a,

215
00:14:21.160 --> 00:14:25.670
at a local startup community.
And so,
uh,

216
00:14:25.690 --> 00:14:30.690
what I did was to turn the offline interactions that I had with people and with

217
00:14:31.391 --> 00:14:34.350
participants of,
of those workshops,
um,

218
00:14:34.420 --> 00:14:38.110
into exercises that I could include in the book,

219
00:14:38.140 --> 00:14:43.120
in these can be applied to many other areas.
So,
you know,
in my case,

220
00:14:43.121 --> 00:14:46.370
it's a book about strategy and storytelling.
If you're writing a book,

221
00:14:46.510 --> 00:14:51.380
the book about computer science or programming or,
or marketing,

222
00:14:51.381 --> 00:14:55.160
you can find ways of everything your readers apply,

223
00:14:55.690 --> 00:15:00.470
the lessons you're,
you're sharing with them and not an important point.

224
00:15:00.850 --> 00:15:05.630
If you noticed at the beginning,
the book has a very,
um,
uh,

225
00:15:05.660 --> 00:15:10.640
rich,
uh,
design element.
And that's,
that's crucial because,
um,

226
00:15:10.940 --> 00:15:15.830
nowadays a book is not just a,
something you really saw salsa,
an object,
uh,

227
00:15:15.831 --> 00:15:20.590
that people want to carry with them.
So the design element,
these,
uh,

228
00:15:20.600 --> 00:15:25.600
as crucial for the success of the book is the content itself.

229
00:15:27.100 --> 00:15:32.050
All right,
so you have,
you have all of these interests,
then you have,
um,

230
00:15:32.600 --> 00:15:36.770
and you have the metrics in,
you have an organizing principle,
the um,

231
00:15:37.070 --> 00:15:40.760
and you package your ideas very firmly.
Uh,

232
00:15:40.790 --> 00:15:42.200
now we can turn them,

233
00:15:42.680 --> 00:15:47.210
turn all of those success metrics into a book proposal.
Um,

234
00:15:47.270 --> 00:15:52.080
and so a book proposal,
uh,
it's like,
or eat,

235
00:15:52.180 --> 00:15:56.630
it is a business plan where you had to provide an overview of what you're

236
00:15:56.631 --> 00:16:00.460
working on,
the audience you're trying to reach.
Um,

237
00:16:00.800 --> 00:16:02.210
who is your competition?

238
00:16:02.211 --> 00:16:06.370
So are there other books out there that are similar to yours?
Uh,

239
00:16:06.380 --> 00:16:10.950
and even I'm a go to market strategy.
So how are you,
once the book is,
um,

240
00:16:11.060 --> 00:16:15.920
is,
um,
in,
in the bookshelves and in the stores,
how do you promote it?

241
00:16:16.520 --> 00:16:21.410
Uh,
and you know,
the best analogy that I have for these informed my experiences,

242
00:16:21.411 --> 00:16:26.000
almost like you have a small startup in your pitching it to investors in,

243
00:16:26.001 --> 00:16:29.930
in this case,
the investors are,
uh,
the book publishing companies,

244
00:16:31.820 --> 00:16:35.690
right?
So finally we have gone through this,

245
00:16:35.691 --> 00:16:38.120
this process of building an audience,

246
00:16:38.121 --> 00:16:41.520
creating a proposal you were successful at,

247
00:16:41.580 --> 00:16:45.260
at selling that proposal,
any identifying it,
publishing partner,

248
00:16:45.530 --> 00:16:47.780
how do you promote the book,
um,

249
00:16:47.990 --> 00:16:51.680
and how do you do it in a cost efficient way.
And this was,

250
00:16:51.920 --> 00:16:56.270
this was particularly important to me being cost efficient and time efficient

251
00:16:56.271 --> 00:17:01.190
because I have a full time job.
So I took some of the,

252
00:17:01.220 --> 00:17:05.330
the,
the,
the skills that I have in,
in media strategy,

253
00:17:05.540 --> 00:17:07.850
in applied,
um,
uh,

254
00:17:08.240 --> 00:17:13.240
content in mark in a strategy principles to the promotion of the book.

255
00:17:14.600 --> 00:17:17.090
So one of the things that,
um,

256
00:17:17.180 --> 00:17:22.150
is crucial is your launching the book is to keep your audience interested,

257
00:17:22.160 --> 00:17:23.360
your initial audience.

258
00:17:23.361 --> 00:17:27.440
Remember of the people that follow view that liked your blog post.

259
00:17:27.920 --> 00:17:28.753
Um,

260
00:17:29.180 --> 00:17:33.110
and a great way to keep a very interesting these to um,

261
00:17:33.890 --> 00:17:35.930
develop a newsletter.
Uh,

262
00:17:35.931 --> 00:17:40.130
I found that a very simple way of writing newsletters that get a lot of

263
00:17:40.131 --> 00:17:41.420
engagement is,
uh,

264
00:17:41.570 --> 00:17:46.570
by setting automatic alerts on Google search for news articles that highlight a

265
00:17:48.270 --> 00:17:52.740
ideas related to the concepts that are you exploring in,
in your book.

266
00:17:52.740 --> 00:17:53.820
So for example,
I,

267
00:17:54.210 --> 00:17:58.110
I have a lot of alerts for things related to storytelling,

268
00:17:58.111 --> 00:18:01.360
east ration strategy.
And then what do you do is,

269
00:18:01.410 --> 00:18:05.880
is to curate those articles.
You summarize them and you share,

270
00:18:05.910 --> 00:18:07.620
share them with your following.

271
00:18:08.520 --> 00:18:11.820
Newsletters are also very important because,
uh,

272
00:18:11.821 --> 00:18:16.821
there are great tools for a running small promotions like giveaways,

273
00:18:17.130 --> 00:18:21.750
uh,
in a,
in an even asking for favors.
So for example,
asking form,

274
00:18:22.030 --> 00:18:22.321
uh,

275
00:18:22.321 --> 00:18:27.321
your readers to share a link to an Amazon page with their friends or to leave a

276
00:18:28.861 --> 00:18:33.150
testimonial on your site and so on.
Um,

277
00:18:33.280 --> 00:18:38.100
this is one of the,
the last one of the few,
few last things that I want to share.

278
00:18:38.101 --> 00:18:41.250
We do a,
which he's trying to do,

279
00:18:41.280 --> 00:18:45.420
trying to create your book as a multi-format experience.

280
00:18:45.720 --> 00:18:50.520
So it started as a,
as a,
a written worth project.
Uh,

281
00:18:50.550 --> 00:18:55.290
but the reality is audiences want to engage with more visual formats,
uh,

282
00:18:55.291 --> 00:18:57.480
specifically video.
Um,

283
00:18:57.580 --> 00:19:02.160
and people want to enter to be entertained and learn the long along the way.

284
00:19:02.161 --> 00:19:05.820
So I use the video automation tool called a whippets.

285
00:19:05.910 --> 00:19:10.440
And essentially what these,
uh,
very simple to use,
um,
uh,

286
00:19:10.441 --> 00:19:15.140
software allows you to do is to summarize,
um,
the book,

287
00:19:15.210 --> 00:19:17.610
the chapters in your book,
um,

288
00:19:17.670 --> 00:19:21.870
find related images and package them into very engaging,

289
00:19:22.140 --> 00:19:26.550
um,
uh,
shareable social videos.
So,
uh,

290
00:19:26.790 --> 00:19:30.570
also related to engaging people with,
uh,

291
00:19:30.600 --> 00:19:35.250
with different formats of your book just beyond the print product.

292
00:19:35.550 --> 00:19:40.110
Um,
I find it very,
very powerful to surprise our readers.

293
00:19:40.111 --> 00:19:43.050
And so what I did in,
in this,
um,

294
00:19:43.080 --> 00:19:48.080
in this case was to develop an augmented reality app where readers can drop

295
00:19:51.150 --> 00:19:56.010
inspiring thoughts,
uh,
in their ideas,
uh,
uh,
in,
um,

296
00:19:56.070 --> 00:20:00.970
in the book,
um,
by pointing their phones at the book cover.

297
00:20:00.971 --> 00:20:05.090
So it's essentially a virtual book club and locked through,
um,

298
00:20:05.130 --> 00:20:09.300
augmented reality.
I'm not sure if the video will play,
but we can,

299
00:20:09.330 --> 00:20:12.180
we can try just so you can see how it looks.

300
00:20:21.950 --> 00:20:22.783
<v 2>Okay.</v>

301
00:21:13.270 --> 00:21:14.103
<v 3>Yeah.</v>

302
00:21:27.680 --> 00:21:30.590
<v 0>So as you,
as you've seen the Biv a year,</v>

303
00:21:30.591 --> 00:21:34.400
he's not bet you need an augmented reality app necessarily,

304
00:21:34.700 --> 00:21:39.130
but a bit you can find interesting ways of,
of uh,

305
00:21:39.200 --> 00:21:43.370
engaging your audience in surprise them along the way.
So,
all right,

306
00:21:43.371 --> 00:21:48.070
so you have all of these,
these interesting activities.
You have a book,

307
00:21:48.071 --> 00:21:52.790
you have an augmented reality app,
your videos,
uh,
what can you do next?

308
00:21:52.820 --> 00:21:57.320
Well,
you can repeat the process either for other projects,

309
00:21:57.410 --> 00:21:57.920
um,

310
00:21:57.920 --> 00:22:02.690
either books or you can do the same thing for other markets.

311
00:22:03.040 --> 00:22:06.030
Um,
so in my case,
um,
I just,
uh,

312
00:22:06.080 --> 00:22:10.610
published the first international version of leave,
like fiction,
we chairs,

313
00:22:11.000 --> 00:22:15.650
uh,
[inaudible],
uh,
it's a Portuguese version.
Um,

314
00:22:15.740 --> 00:22:20.480
and he follows,
it,
follows exactly the same,
the same approach.

315
00:22:21.020 --> 00:22:25.850
And um,
I will leave you with the trailer that I made to promote,
um,

316
00:22:25.880 --> 00:22:29.150
the,
the book in Portugal and then we can,
uh,

317
00:22:29.180 --> 00:22:31.640
we can have a discussion in Q and a.

318
00:22:36.720 --> 00:22:37.680
<v 3>Oh,</v>

319
00:22:55.180 --> 00:22:56.480
<v 0>all right.
So thank you.</v>

320
00:22:57.100 --> 00:22:57.933
<v 1>Okay.</v>

321
00:23:01.190 --> 00:23:05.030
<v 0>All right.
Thank you,
Francesco with these was great.
Um,</v>

322
00:23:05.780 --> 00:23:07.640
so as a reminder to her microphone was on the aisles.

323
00:23:07.641 --> 00:23:11.390
If you want to ask a question just for free and go ahead and ask.
But,
uh,

324
00:23:11.660 --> 00:23:15.170
let me start by asking you,
um,
what,

325
00:23:16.730 --> 00:23:21.460
where did the idea of becoming an author just,
uh,
uh,

326
00:23:21.500 --> 00:23:23.900
come from?
Yes.
So the,
my,

327
00:23:23.960 --> 00:23:27.810
my initial objective was not to become an author,
it just,
uh,

328
00:23:27.860 --> 00:23:30.830
really app and organically.
Um,

329
00:23:30.980 --> 00:23:35.300
as I mentioned the first time I moved to New York City,

330
00:23:35.540 --> 00:23:37.040
I didn't really know anyone in.

331
00:23:37.041 --> 00:23:42.041
So one way of coping with this transition to the professional world was to take

332
00:23:44.331 --> 00:23:46.250
notes and how people

333
00:23:46.850 --> 00:23:50.570
<v 4>behaved in then I'm in different situations,</v>

334
00:23:50.571 --> 00:23:54.230
in social circumstances,
professional circumstances,

335
00:23:54.500 --> 00:23:59.330
and then translate those ideas into,
um,
strategies that I can,

336
00:23:59.390 --> 00:24:03.890
that I could use.
Um,
and then after initially,
uh,

337
00:24:04.060 --> 00:24:05.750
a few,
uh,

338
00:24:05.780 --> 00:24:10.370
colleagues and friends and the chance to read it and,
uh,

339
00:24:10.371 --> 00:24:15.230
and encouraged me to share it wider,
and that's where the entire process,

340
00:24:15.580 --> 00:24:20.570
um,
the entire process began.
One thing that I would say is that,
um,

341
00:24:21.170 --> 00:24:25.600
it's very challenging to go through all of it,
but once you do it,
uh,

342
00:24:25.730 --> 00:24:28.760
it becomes very easy to replicate a,

343
00:24:28.761 --> 00:24:32.150
so hopefully I'll be looking to more,

344
00:24:32.180 --> 00:24:34.280
more projects in the future like this.

345
00:24:34.510 --> 00:24:37.030
<v 5>Yeah,
we too.
Absolutely.
Um,</v>

346
00:24:38.650 --> 00:24:42.070
just in the same line,
um,
who's your favorite author?

347
00:24:42.620 --> 00:24:46.820
<v 4>Well,
I,
I have many different,
um,
authors that I,</v>

348
00:24:46.821 --> 00:24:50.900
that I like.
Um,
I can pinpoint one specifically,

349
00:24:51.290 --> 00:24:53.510
um,
but,
um,

350
00:24:53.570 --> 00:24:58.570
I'm actually reading a very interesting book called the invention of News,

351
00:24:59.150 --> 00:25:03.800
uh,
which traces back,
which traces them,
uh,

352
00:25:03.830 --> 00:25:04.580
the,

353
00:25:04.580 --> 00:25:09.140
the news industry back to the 13 androids,
uh,

354
00:25:09.170 --> 00:25:11.770
all the way to modern times.
So it's a,
it's,

355
00:25:11.771 --> 00:25:15.950
it's very interesting for me as that's my industry,

356
00:25:15.951 --> 00:25:19.520
but I usually read a lot of nonfiction books.

357
00:25:20.530 --> 00:25:25.000
<v 5>Right.
That's very interesting.
Um,
well,
I did have a question about your,</v>

358
00:25:25.001 --> 00:25:27.820
your book or a few questions about your book,
but before,
uh,

359
00:25:27.821 --> 00:25:32.710
well you did mention that you wrote a blog post,
right?
It went viral.

360
00:25:33.190 --> 00:25:38.190
So did you ever consider just taking two writing blog posts or just be a

361
00:25:38.711 --> 00:25:39.544
blogger?

362
00:25:40.060 --> 00:25:43.810
<v 4>Um,
no,
because you know,
the,
the initial,</v>

363
00:25:43.870 --> 00:25:48.870
the initial goal was to see if I could execute on the strategy of turning

364
00:25:52.031 --> 00:25:56.080
something digital into a physical.
Um,

365
00:25:56.140 --> 00:25:59.560
and it was important to me as a personal interest in,

366
00:25:59.561 --> 00:26:04.561
as a media strategist to try to explore different ways of telling a story,

367
00:26:05.681 --> 00:26:09.740
not only through a blog post,
but through a physical book,
uh,

368
00:26:09.850 --> 00:26:13.390
videos and augmented reality APP,
um,
in,

369
00:26:13.391 --> 00:26:17.830
so creating a portfolio of experiences.
Um,
and again,

370
00:26:17.831 --> 00:26:22.810
the most enjoying thing is the,
is the process of figuring out how to do it,
uh,

371
00:26:22.811 --> 00:26:25.140
in to learn about new,
um,

372
00:26:25.330 --> 00:26:30.130
new strategies or new technologies and uh,
and then implement them in,

373
00:26:30.140 --> 00:26:32.740
in,
um,
in,
in the project specifically.

374
00:26:33.570 --> 00:26:38.040
<v 5>Right.
Okay.
Um,
so now talking about your,</v>

375
00:26:38.041 --> 00:26:41.820
your book teach color.
Um,

376
00:26:43.110 --> 00:26:46.280
did you originally intend to have the book as,

377
00:26:46.281 --> 00:26:48.360
as an open source book or were you,

378
00:26:48.390 --> 00:26:52.800
or did you ever conceive they're having or maybe following the traditional

379
00:26:52.801 --> 00:26:54.630
approach at some point?

380
00:26:55.270 --> 00:26:58.970
<v 4>No,
the initial goal was,
um,
you know,
if I'm a,</v>

381
00:26:59.680 --> 00:27:04.540
if I'm promoting innovation as part of my,
my professional career in,

382
00:27:04.541 --> 00:27:08.750
if I'm encouraging new ways of thinking of our media strategy,
um,

383
00:27:09.100 --> 00:27:11.450
it would be better if myself,
I,

384
00:27:11.510 --> 00:27:16.360
if I explore new avenues and new routes to,
um,
uh,
to,

385
00:27:16.420 --> 00:27:20.650
to publish content.
So I wanted to,
for the process to be,
uh,

386
00:27:20.651 --> 00:27:25.651
to break away from the traditional model and apply a more user centric,

387
00:27:26.920 --> 00:27:29.660
uh,
approach,
uh,
to,
to writing the book.

388
00:27:29.661 --> 00:27:34.390
So putting the audience first rather than then last,
um,

389
00:27:34.450 --> 00:27:36.250
and then,
uh,
use that,

390
00:27:36.480 --> 00:27:41.480
that initial feedback to improve the book in validated before it's distributed

391
00:27:42.240 --> 00:27:43.140
wider.
Bye.

392
00:27:43.460 --> 00:27:47.660
<v 5>Uh,
by a publisher there.
Right.
Very innovative indeed.
Thank you.</v>

393
00:27:48.080 --> 00:27:53.000
Have a question from the audience.
Yes.
Hello.
Thanks Francesco for coming.
Um,

394
00:27:53.090 --> 00:27:57.830
you mentioned in your talk how you shared your book and the ideas with a group

395
00:27:57.831 --> 00:28:01.370
of 10 people.
How did you actually decide who those 10 people should be?

396
00:28:01.371 --> 00:28:03.650
Because depending on the composition,

397
00:28:03.651 --> 00:28:07.520
that would greatly kind of bias a book one way or another.

398
00:28:07.550 --> 00:28:09.910
We're looking for people who were,
uh,

399
00:28:10.280 --> 00:28:13.910
you knew work a little bit more critical or people who just make you feel good

400
00:28:13.970 --> 00:28:14.803
depending on your [inaudible].

401
00:28:15.130 --> 00:28:18.400
<v 4>That's a great question.
In a specifically,
uh,</v>

402
00:28:18.500 --> 00:28:23.270
when I was designing these small focus group,
um,
I picked,

403
00:28:23.330 --> 00:28:27.290
uh,
friends who I know are very critical.
Uh,

404
00:28:27.291 --> 00:28:32.150
and in fact the question that I asked was,
tell me what's wrong.

405
00:28:32.600 --> 00:28:36.080
Um,
and um,
and after you do that,

406
00:28:36.081 --> 00:28:40.820
tell me what you like.
And so inviting these feedback and inviting,

407
00:28:41.150 --> 00:28:45.830
um,
the,
um,
the,
the initial work to be dissected in,

408
00:28:45.831 --> 00:28:50.831
evaluated by people that I know are very critical was very important to me

409
00:28:50.991 --> 00:28:55.660
because,
uh,
once it goes through a,
that,
that smell test,

410
00:28:55.670 --> 00:29:00.200
then in you're able to improve your work based on,

411
00:29:00.230 --> 00:29:00.890
on,

412
00:29:00.890 --> 00:29:05.890
on those interactions that then you're likely going to have some something that

413
00:29:07.010 --> 00:29:10.010
everyone enjoys.
Um,
and I also,

414
00:29:10.190 --> 00:29:13.600
I also searched for people or either notified,
uh,

415
00:29:13.700 --> 00:29:17.340
friends and families from different,
from different areas.

416
00:29:17.360 --> 00:29:21.350
So not only people that work in media or entrepreneurship,

417
00:29:21.680 --> 00:29:23.870
but you know,
um,

418
00:29:24.260 --> 00:29:29.260
friends that worked in the medical field and friends who are artists or

419
00:29:29.631 --> 00:29:32.860
teachers.
And so trying to have,
um,
uh,

420
00:29:32.940 --> 00:29:37.940
an audience or initial audience that could represent the y the wider world.

421
00:29:39.830 --> 00:29:42.120
<v 5>Is 10 a magic number?
Was</v>

422
00:29:42.130 --> 00:29:44.630
<v 4>it like three friends that,
that like Hugh through France and you know,</v>

423
00:29:44.631 --> 00:29:49.540
like you and maybe mom and dad?
No,
it was not in a magic number.

424
00:29:49.541 --> 00:29:54.540
It was just,
um,
you know,
I was looking for initial,
um,
group of,

425
00:29:54.541 --> 00:29:57.490
of people that could provide,
uh,
some,

426
00:29:57.491 --> 00:30:00.820
some guy than Cindy just step and to be 10.
Uh,

427
00:30:00.850 --> 00:30:05.380
but I think that's a,
that's a good number.
Uh,
I think five,
ease,

428
00:30:05.440 --> 00:30:09.460
ease,
ease,
too small and um,
you know,
maybe one end.

429
00:30:09.461 --> 00:30:14.290
Are these east too big?
So,
um,
something,
something in between.
Right?

430
00:30:14.291 --> 00:30:19.090
So aspiring writers and authors and people forget that.
Uh,
okay.

431
00:30:19.091 --> 00:30:20.920
So now in the lines of feedback,

432
00:30:22.660 --> 00:30:27.640
how did you prepare for,
for not positive feedback?

433
00:30:27.670 --> 00:30:30.850
I mean,
you,
by doing the book has an open source.

434
00:30:31.210 --> 00:30:34.960
You probably knew that there was a possibility that some of the feedback that

435
00:30:34.961 --> 00:30:38.710
you were going to receive was not necessarily what you wanted to hear or read.

436
00:30:39.040 --> 00:30:43.330
So how did you prepare yourself for that?
Yes.
So,
uh,
two,
two main things.

437
00:30:43.331 --> 00:30:48.331
So the first thing is that the main objective was to produce a very good

438
00:30:49.721 --> 00:30:54.630
product,
a very good book.
And so if that's the focus,
then,
um,

439
00:30:55.330 --> 00:31:00.190
I could look at feedback as a way of improving in getting close to,
um,

440
00:31:00.310 --> 00:31:01.150
to,
to that,

441
00:31:01.300 --> 00:31:06.070
to that vision in the second point is that you don't have to receive,

442
00:31:06.190 --> 00:31:10.660
um,
or implement all the feedback you,
uh,
you,
you get,

443
00:31:10.960 --> 00:31:11.793
so there's a,

444
00:31:12.040 --> 00:31:17.040
there's a a balancing act between the feedback you receive in your own,

445
00:31:17.830 --> 00:31:22.690
um,
uh,
you know,
your own direction,
your own creative spirit.

446
00:31:22.691 --> 00:31:27.640
So you have to be able to manage both of those in a while.

447
00:31:27.641 --> 00:31:29.510
Staying true to your own voice in,

448
00:31:29.560 --> 00:31:33.790
into what do you want to convey in the book that you're writing.

449
00:31:34.460 --> 00:31:37.360
Right.
Okay.
I have to say that's very courageous of you.
Ah,

450
00:31:37.361 --> 00:31:42.310
I'm not so sure if I would just want to open the things our ride to the open net

451
00:31:42.340 --> 00:31:46.210
and see what feedback I get a,
so,
yeah.
Good stuff.
Thank you.

452
00:31:46.780 --> 00:31:51.520
Very courageous.
Um,
okay,
so kinda shifting gears a bit.
Um,

453
00:31:52.000 --> 00:31:56.800
well,
technology is,
is part of your book.
It's,
it's basically at its core.

454
00:31:57.250 --> 00:32:02.200
Um,
when did you decide to incorporate technology in,
in,
in your book?

455
00:32:02.500 --> 00:32:06.420
Uh,
well,
I mean,
it's part of,
uh,
my,
uh,
uh,

456
00:32:06.630 --> 00:32:10.600
technology is part of my language.
It's,
it's what I do as,
uh,
in,

457
00:32:10.601 --> 00:32:14.200
in my profession.
And so,
um,
you know,

458
00:32:14.201 --> 00:32:19.201
today we have so many tools available to us that can really help us scale our

459
00:32:19.751 --> 00:32:24.740
creativity in these collaboration between humans in,

460
00:32:24.741 --> 00:32:28.660
in machines is something that I'm very passionate about.
Um,

461
00:32:28.690 --> 00:32:33.010
so I wanted to incorporate technology from,
from day one,
uh,

462
00:32:33.160 --> 00:32:37.100
and then means,
um,
using a,
a,
you know,

463
00:32:37.220 --> 00:32:40.910
online shared document to,
um,
you know,

464
00:32:40.911 --> 00:32:44.630
online platform for sharing blog posts,

465
00:32:44.930 --> 00:32:49.930
which in my case was medium all the way to using a video automation in,

466
00:32:51.011 --> 00:32:55.070
in augmented reality.
Um,
in,
as I mentioned,

467
00:32:55.071 --> 00:32:59.150
it was a process of exploration,
not only of the concept of the book,

468
00:32:59.480 --> 00:33:04.220
but what I could do around it in,
um,
the strategies that I could implement,

469
00:33:04.600 --> 00:33:06.260
uh,
as part of this project.

470
00:33:06.820 --> 00:33:11.560
<v 5>Right.
And then you also mentioned that,
well,
you have a full time job.</v>

471
00:33:12.130 --> 00:33:16.000
So how,
tell us how you balance that.
I mean,
did,

472
00:33:16.001 --> 00:33:21.001
did your job and the associated pres somehow help you achieve what you wanted to

473
00:33:21.461 --> 00:33:24.300
achieve with the book or through the process?
Um,

474
00:33:24.310 --> 00:33:27.440
just tell us how you balance that.
Because I think sometimes,
you know,

475
00:33:27.460 --> 00:33:30.460
we all want to do things,
but oh,
where I'm so busy with my,

476
00:33:30.730 --> 00:33:34.810
with my job that I just can't find the time for just doing whatever,
you know,

477
00:33:34.811 --> 00:33:38.230
whatever I haven't been wanting to do for so long.
So how did you balance?

478
00:33:38.540 --> 00:33:41.210
<v 4>Yeah,
absolutely.
So first of all,</v>

479
00:33:41.270 --> 00:33:43.850
these was a hobby for me.

480
00:33:43.851 --> 00:33:48.380
Something that I was very interested in pursuing.
Uh,
and you know,

481
00:33:48.450 --> 00:33:52.210
I really enjoy doing it.
And so,
um,

482
00:33:52.280 --> 00:33:56.780
if that's the case and if you're doing an enjoyable activity becomes much easier

483
00:33:57.050 --> 00:34:00.250
when you arrive home after a long day at work in,

484
00:34:00.330 --> 00:34:05.270
you use it as a way of relaxing,
of distracting yourself.

485
00:34:05.630 --> 00:34:09.260
Um,
and that's,
that's what I,
that's what I did,

486
00:34:09.261 --> 00:34:11.840
use these creative process,
uh,

487
00:34:11.960 --> 00:34:16.700
to not only inspired the book,
but also inspire,
uh,

488
00:34:16.730 --> 00:34:20.870
my,
you know,
my daily life in my profession because I,
I,

489
00:34:20.900 --> 00:34:25.520
I feel that having a hobbyist crucial,
uh,
because it's a source of,

490
00:34:25.550 --> 00:34:29.990
of creativity that you can then channel into different areas of,

491
00:34:30.410 --> 00:34:34.940
of,
uh,
of your life.
Uh,
in also there's,
you know,
there's the weekend,

492
00:34:34.941 --> 00:34:38.030
which is a,
a,
a great,
um,
you know,

493
00:34:38.031 --> 00:34:42.200
if you count the number of hours in things that you can accomplish on a weekend,

494
00:34:42.201 --> 00:34:46.760
if it's something enjoyable to you.
Uh,
there's,
there's a lot of time,
uh,

495
00:34:46.761 --> 00:34:50.390
specifically my work as a media strategies.
There's a,

496
00:34:50.391 --> 00:34:52.430
at a large news organization,

497
00:34:53.060 --> 00:34:57.620
I get to learn about a new technologies,
new strategies.

498
00:34:57.621 --> 00:35:02.390
And so,
uh,
some of those lessons learned,
um,
ended up,

499
00:35:02.570 --> 00:35:04.220
um,
playing a role in,

500
00:35:04.520 --> 00:35:08.650
in what you do or in my case or what I did outside work.
Uh,

501
00:35:08.651 --> 00:35:13.651
so learning about video automation in learning about how to develop newsletters

502
00:35:14.001 --> 00:35:17.840
out to curate content.
Uh,
it's something that,
um,

503
00:35:17.960 --> 00:35:22.760
that I was exposed to through my work to.
Do you ever ask your,

504
00:35:22.810 --> 00:35:27.620
your coworkers for feedback about the book?
Uh,
yeah,
absolutely.
And,
um,
in fact,

505
00:35:27.680 --> 00:35:32.150
um,
we have,
uh,
a very successful internship program.

506
00:35:32.510 --> 00:35:34.460
Uh,
and I was,
uh,
the,

507
00:35:34.490 --> 00:35:39.330
my publisher gave me several copies of the books so we could give it to,

508
00:35:39.390 --> 00:35:42.240
to our interns.
Um,
and I've,

509
00:35:42.241 --> 00:35:45.750
I've also shared some presentations in some ideas,

510
00:35:45.751 --> 00:35:49.460
specifically about the book with,
with my colleagues in,
uh,

511
00:35:49.470 --> 00:35:54.470
they have been wonderful at supporting the project as well as providing

512
00:35:54.751 --> 00:35:57.030
feedback,
asking questions in,
in so on.

513
00:35:57.880 --> 00:36:01.480
<v 5>Again,
a very courageous of you.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Um,</v>

514
00:36:02.260 --> 00:36:07.260
what advice can you give those future authors that are watching this on youtube?

515
00:36:07.391 --> 00:36:10.140
What,
what's the maybe three things you can tell them more?

516
00:36:10.141 --> 00:36:13.810
Or the one thing you can tell them to do?
Those were thinking about,

517
00:36:14.170 --> 00:36:18.460
as I said before,
I started their own project,
but maybe they just don't have,

518
00:36:18.490 --> 00:36:21.820
they think they don't have the time or,
or,
or so,

519
00:36:22.060 --> 00:36:25.650
<v 4>yeah.
So I think the most important things,
uh,</v>

520
00:36:25.810 --> 00:36:30.760
to develop a plan of,
uh,
the steps you want to accomplish,

521
00:36:31.120 --> 00:36:32.720
uh,
and um,

522
00:36:32.830 --> 00:36:37.830
the action items that you have to do or to execute to get to that larger vision.

523
00:36:38.501 --> 00:36:43.030
So for example,
in these discussion today,
I shared,
um,
you know,

524
00:36:43.060 --> 00:36:47.830
10 principles that I found important in,
in,
in my journey.

525
00:36:48.130 --> 00:36:51.670
Um,
I think these are applicable to other people,
but each,

526
00:36:51.910 --> 00:36:56.910
each individual will have their own unique way of approaching a book project.

527
00:36:58.660 --> 00:37:02.560
But again,
if you're able to define a plan and stick to it,

528
00:37:02.620 --> 00:37:04.300
eventually you'll see results.

529
00:37:04.600 --> 00:37:08.810
And that was important to me because I wanted to,
uh,

530
00:37:08.920 --> 00:37:12.110
give up every single day as I was,
uh,

531
00:37:12.160 --> 00:37:16.120
creating this project because,
you know,
it's,
uh,

532
00:37:16.210 --> 00:37:19.950
you're getting rejected by publishers or you know,

533
00:37:19.960 --> 00:37:24.760
the feedback is very harsh or you are not able to,
um,

534
00:37:24.820 --> 00:37:28.450
you know,
create a cert,
execute on a certain idea that you had.

535
00:37:28.451 --> 00:37:32.470
So having that guiding principle in there,

536
00:37:32.530 --> 00:37:36.310
knowing what a light at the end of the tunnel in terms of your creative

537
00:37:36.311 --> 00:37:41.110
processes,
um,
is crucial as,
as you're developing a,

538
00:37:41.111 --> 00:37:42.990
a book project or any media

539
00:37:43.030 --> 00:37:46.830
<v 5>project.
Right.
Okay.
Well,
uh,
have maybe one more question.</v>

540
00:37:46.840 --> 00:37:47.920
If the audience has any questions,

541
00:37:47.921 --> 00:37:50.320
please approach Mike's a yes and we have a question.

542
00:37:50.410 --> 00:37:51.630
<v 6>Yeah,
thanks for coming.
Um,</v>

543
00:37:52.240 --> 00:37:56.560
I have spoken with a lot of authors and I worked with some of them closely and I

544
00:37:56.561 --> 00:38:00.880
feel a lot of them have gone through this great marathon of creating this,

545
00:38:01.510 --> 00:38:02.410
this work,
this item,

546
00:38:03.040 --> 00:38:08.040
and they sort of run out of energy when it comes time to self promote.

547
00:38:09.250 --> 00:38:11.290
Some of them expect the publisher would you do this?

548
00:38:11.291 --> 00:38:16.291
And it's not a lot of resources and publishing these days to really pull that

549
00:38:16.331 --> 00:38:17.440
through all the way.

550
00:38:17.800 --> 00:38:22.060
What sort of advice would you offer to authors who have gone through the race

551
00:38:22.061 --> 00:38:24.860
and are basically in their mind finish,

552
00:38:24.861 --> 00:38:28.000
but they have a little ways to go and to making their books as success?

553
00:38:28.300 --> 00:38:31.030
What sort of advice do you have to keep their energy levels up in that self

554
00:38:31.031 --> 00:38:34.630
promotion phase,
which I think is just so key that you're talking.

555
00:38:34.990 --> 00:38:39.670
<v 4>Absolutely.
And um,
that's excellent question because I,
I felt,</v>

556
00:38:39.880 --> 00:38:41.950
uh,
the,
you know,
what you just described,

557
00:38:41.951 --> 00:38:46.160
which is some fatigue after going through all of these Sanford and then,
uh,

558
00:38:46.210 --> 00:38:50.500
you still have to,
to promote the book.
Uh,
one,

559
00:38:50.680 --> 00:38:53.530
one thing that I find very energizing and all do,

560
00:38:53.531 --> 00:38:58.531
I've been talking about how to leverage technology in a different marketing

561
00:38:58.601 --> 00:39:02.320
tools that are available out there.
Um,
I found very,

562
00:39:03.070 --> 00:39:07.960
very rewarding to have offline discussions with,
with people in,
in,

563
00:39:08.020 --> 00:39:08.350
uh,

564
00:39:08.350 --> 00:39:13.350
in readers and potential readers because then you get to interact with,

565
00:39:13.690 --> 00:39:17.560
uh,
you know,
with people that are just like you and,
uh,

566
00:39:17.650 --> 00:39:21.530
you get new ideas and you see how,
uh,
from,
um,

567
00:39:21.610 --> 00:39:26.170
how they are enjoying reading it in,
in that's,
that's,
uh,
that's inspiring.

568
00:39:26.890 --> 00:39:29.380
And as I'm writing,
um,
you know,

569
00:39:29.740 --> 00:39:33.640
or as I was writing this book in any other projects,

570
00:39:33.820 --> 00:39:38.260
I always think about one or two people,
specific people,

571
00:39:38.261 --> 00:39:42.610
friends or people that I met at an event or at a conference.
Those are,

572
00:39:42.640 --> 00:39:44.950
those are,
that's my audience.

573
00:39:44.980 --> 00:39:48.280
And so I'm thinking about that specific person.

574
00:39:48.281 --> 00:39:52.030
I'm thinking about John or Sarah or whoever it might be.

575
00:39:52.330 --> 00:39:57.330
And I'm in everything that in mind of how will they react once this is out.

576
00:39:58.840 --> 00:39:59.673
So again,

577
00:40:00.610 --> 00:40:05.610
not folk focusing of course on being creative and resourceful in terms of the

578
00:40:06.371 --> 00:40:11.290
technology tools you use to market your book,
but most importantly,

579
00:40:11.350 --> 00:40:16.180
find avenues to interact,
uh,
with people in real life.

580
00:40:18.190 --> 00:40:22.830
Thank you.
Okay,
Francesco,
one last question.
Um,

581
00:40:23.050 --> 00:40:26.890
what's next?
So we know your book is published in Portuguese now,

582
00:40:27.280 --> 00:40:31.780
do you plan to do more,
more versions,
perhaps Italian?
Yeah,

583
00:40:31.781 --> 00:40:36.100
I would love to,
to do more versions in,
um,
um,
you know,

584
00:40:36.101 --> 00:40:40.150
looking forward to finding partners in,
uh,

585
00:40:40.151 --> 00:40:42.760
in readers in,
in,
in,
um,

586
00:40:43.060 --> 00:40:45.460
in other countries because the,

587
00:40:45.461 --> 00:40:50.461
the feedback that I've been getting has been very positive and that's re very

588
00:40:51.461 --> 00:40:52.580
rewarding.
And,
uh,

589
00:40:53.020 --> 00:40:58.020
I would love to share some of some of the ideas in the creativity we even more

590
00:40:58.211 --> 00:41:03.100
people.
So I'm awfully more translated versions in the future.

591
00:41:03.130 --> 00:41:06.790
And any other plans to write more books or other subjects?

592
00:41:06.810 --> 00:41:11.490
Do you have in mind for future?
Yeah,
I have some,
some,
some other ideas,
but,
uh,

593
00:41:11.540 --> 00:41:16.540
right now I'm focusing on and on making these specific project a successful.

594
00:41:19.480 --> 00:41:22.570
Um,
and then I'm sure eventually I'll,
uh,

595
00:41:23.080 --> 00:41:27.770
I'll explore other concepts or other book ideas.
So.
All right.

596
00:41:27.890 --> 00:41:29.650
All right.
Well,
thank you so much for coming.

597
00:41:29.651 --> 00:41:34.160
We're definitely appreciate your time and,
uh,
thank you for your ideas with us.
