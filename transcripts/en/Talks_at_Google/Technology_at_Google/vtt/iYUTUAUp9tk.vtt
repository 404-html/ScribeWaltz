00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:09.870
Welcome to toxic Google.
I'm Alan Moss.

2
00:00:09.871 --> 00:00:14.070
I'm vice president of sales and operations here in it is my distinct pleasure to

3
00:00:14.071 --> 00:00:16.650
welcome Leslie Berlin to toxic Google.
Thank you.

4
00:00:17.040 --> 00:00:20.430
Leslie is the author of the recently published book,

5
00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:23.220
troublemakers Silicon Valley's coming of age.

6
00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:25.920
Her first book was the man behind the microchip,

7
00:00:25.950 --> 00:00:28.410
Robert Noise in the invention of Silicon Valley.

8
00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:33.240
She is project historian for the Silicon Valley Archives at Stanford University

9
00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:38.250
and she's been a columnist for the New York Times and commented on technology

10
00:00:38.251 --> 00:00:42.540
and Silicon Valley for the Wall Street Journal,
NPR,
BBC,

11
00:00:42.541 --> 00:00:45.330
the Atlantic PBS wire.
Do you get it?

12
00:00:45.331 --> 00:00:49.620
So really thrilled to have Leslie today and a host,

13
00:00:49.621 --> 00:00:53.480
a conversation on her knee book.
So what we'll do is,
um,

14
00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:57.180
I'll have an opportunity to,
um,
talk a bit and,

15
00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:00.420
and have this conversation with Leslie and then we'll open it up to your,

16
00:01:00.630 --> 00:01:02.160
your questions.
Um,

17
00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:06.690
conglomerates are usually not bashful and we have a mic here and,
um,

18
00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:10.770
special inducement,
particularly good questions.
So we'll also come with a buck,

19
00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:15.030
a copy of your own.
Uh,
welcome,
Leslie.
Great to have you here.
Thank you.

20
00:01:15.690 --> 00:01:19.620
Um,
so,
uh,
where to start,

21
00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:20.880
um,

22
00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:25.880
in troublemakers you chronicle seven individuals who were in the technology

23
00:01:26.371 --> 00:01:30.510
space,
the very early days of 1969 to about 1984.

24
00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:31.500
Um,

25
00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:36.500
and their contributions to not only founding new industries and video gaming,

26
00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:41.520
personal computing,
biotechnology,
and many more,
many more.

27
00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:44.640
How did you choose to,
to focus on these individuals?

28
00:01:45.610 --> 00:01:45.791
<v 2>Well,</v>

29
00:01:45.791 --> 00:01:50.791
the first thing I did was I put together a timeline of silicon valley history

30
00:01:51.521 --> 00:01:54.610
just with a dot for each kind of significant event.

31
00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:59.560
And in this period between 1969 in 1976,

32
00:01:59.590 --> 00:02:01.840
the,
the density of dots,

33
00:02:01.870 --> 00:02:06.870
what's unmatched anywhere because you had the founding of apple,

34
00:02:07.180 --> 00:02:11.410
Genentech,
Atari,
Kleiner Perkins,
sequoia capital,

35
00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:14.890
you're the first arpanet transmission that turns into the Internet.

36
00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:19.330
You had the birth of the independent software business,
you had the,

37
00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:24.330
the invention of the microchip,
the microprocessor.
And it was,
uh,

38
00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:28.950
like watching.
It was like watching the big bang,
basically just,

39
00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:30.400
uh,

40
00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:34.870
because before this time silicon valley was like this regional backwater wasn't

41
00:02:34.871 --> 00:02:39.340
even called Silicon Valley and,
d,
it was sort of existed around one industry,

42
00:02:39.341 --> 00:02:42.070
which was microchips is semi conductors.

43
00:02:42.071 --> 00:02:46.870
And it was gearheads selling to gearheads.
And at the end of really,

44
00:02:46.871 --> 00:02:49.240
if you just look at the first seven years,

45
00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:52.630
you have personal computing and video games.

46
00:02:52.630 --> 00:02:56.260
So you have the first really kind of high tech consumer electronics,

47
00:02:56.261 --> 00:03:00.880
making it out into the world,
microprocessor,
consumer electronics,

48
00:03:01.210 --> 00:03:04.700
you have the biotech industry being born and modern venture cap.

49
00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:09.250
It was crazy to see what had happened.
And then I was trying to figure out,

50
00:03:09.251 --> 00:03:13.510
well how on earth do you tell a story that has this complicated?

51
00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:17.650
And I decided that the answer had to be that you had to find good people to tell

52
00:03:17.651 --> 00:03:22.651
the story through because I don't know how many of you have ever sat through a

53
00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:26.950
reading about the invention of a particular piece of technology and that can be

54
00:03:26.951 --> 00:03:29.020
kind of dry.
And whereas I,

55
00:03:29.290 --> 00:03:34.290
I think that the stories of how people did it and sometimes how they failed to

56
00:03:34.361 --> 00:03:36.880
do it are very interesting.

57
00:03:37.330 --> 00:03:39.520
So my criteria were three.

58
00:03:39.521 --> 00:03:43.990
I wanted to find people who were largely unknown.

59
00:03:43.990 --> 00:03:48.460
That was really important to me.
Um,
so this is why when I write about apple,

60
00:03:48.461 --> 00:03:53.260
for example,
I don't write about jobs and I don't write about Wazniak.

61
00:03:53.261 --> 00:03:57.790
I mean they are both peripheral characters next to the person who's my main

62
00:03:57.791 --> 00:04:00.990
focus,
who is Mike Markkula.
And,
um,

63
00:04:01.090 --> 00:04:03.310
most people don't know about Mike,

64
00:04:03.340 --> 00:04:08.340
but Mike owned a third of apple along with jobs and was when they started the

65
00:04:09.311 --> 00:04:10.144
company.

66
00:04:10.330 --> 00:04:15.330
And he was the guy who came to the famous garage in Cupertino and saw these two

67
00:04:17.321 --> 00:04:21.670
guys who,
I mean,
jobs was 21 was,

68
00:04:21.671 --> 00:04:26.230
was a few years older jobs would have loved to figure out how to start a
company.

69
00:04:26.231 --> 00:04:26.770
But I mean,

70
00:04:26.770 --> 00:04:30.970
he had 17 months of business experience in his entire life and that was as a

71
00:04:30.971 --> 00:04:33.400
tech for Atari was,

72
00:04:33.401 --> 00:04:37.330
would've been happy to stay at HP forever and ever.
Um,
as,

73
00:04:37.331 --> 00:04:40.570
as an engineer.
As a matter of fact,
he tried to sell the Apple Watch.

74
00:04:40.600 --> 00:04:44.080
He tried to give the apple one to HP and they didn't want it.

75
00:04:44.740 --> 00:04:47.950
So,
uh,
I,
I would,

76
00:04:48.820 --> 00:04:51.940
I knew that there were tons and tons of these little companies,

77
00:04:51.941 --> 00:04:56.941
these little a personal computer want to be companies in what we now call

78
00:04:57.131 --> 00:04:59.800
silicon valley in places like Albuquerque.

79
00:05:00.100 --> 00:05:02.380
So what was it that was special about this company?

80
00:05:02.381 --> 00:05:06.040
Because they all had a job Zn type,

81
00:05:06.280 --> 00:05:09.880
not as brilliant as Steve Jobs.
They all had a,
was Anakin type,

82
00:05:10.450 --> 00:05:12.250
not as brilliant as was perhaps,

83
00:05:12.251 --> 00:05:16.690
but none of them had a Mike Markkula and Mike had retired from Intel.

84
00:05:16.691 --> 00:05:18.790
He'd gotten there before the IPO.

85
00:05:19.060 --> 00:05:22.360
He had watched this little bitty company that was in,
you know,

86
00:05:22.361 --> 00:05:27.130
another company's cast off space,
grow into what it became.

87
00:05:27.670 --> 00:05:32.230
And he knew how to,
how to turn this idea.

88
00:05:32.231 --> 00:05:36.040
He saw,
which was the apple too,
into what apple became,

89
00:05:36.041 --> 00:05:39.520
which was the youngest company ever to make it into the fortune 500.

90
00:05:39.790 --> 00:05:44.560
So I wanted to tell the stories of those people whose roles were so important,

91
00:05:44.561 --> 00:05:46.760
but nobody knew thems.
And,
um,

92
00:05:46.780 --> 00:05:51.070
what inspired it actually was I was at a party and,
uh,

93
00:05:51.430 --> 00:05:56.430
at this party was the COO of a company that has a superstar CEO and COO started

94
00:05:58.341 --> 00:06:02.270
singing a little song and the song's only words where I did all the work.

95
00:06:02.271 --> 00:06:06.400
He got all the credit and I thought,
you know,
the,

96
00:06:06.740 --> 00:06:08.600
for all the people in the spotlight,

97
00:06:08.601 --> 00:06:10.880
even the people who deserve to be in the spotlight,

98
00:06:11.330 --> 00:06:16.330
there are so many people who are just outside the spotlight without whom that

99
00:06:16.341 --> 00:06:18.080
person in the spotlight would never be there.

100
00:06:18.110 --> 00:06:22.820
And so I wanted to tell those people's stories.
Yeah.
So that was criteria one,

101
00:06:22.821 --> 00:06:25.460
right?
They had to be,
they had to be unknown criteria too.

102
00:06:25.461 --> 00:06:27.450
They had to be important.
Um,
it,

103
00:06:27.480 --> 00:06:31.700
I the plenty of unknowns who don't do anything important.
Um,

104
00:06:31.910 --> 00:06:35.150
and then the,
the third criteria was they had to be really,

105
00:06:35.151 --> 00:06:39.380
really interesting people for just what I was talking about earlier.
This,

106
00:06:39.410 --> 00:06:43.030
this is a book for a general audience.
I,
it's,
it's a,

107
00:06:43.130 --> 00:06:47.780
it's a bunch of stories in addition to having these sort of broader themes and

108
00:06:47.781 --> 00:06:52.250
it's,
it's underpinned by a hundred pages of notes at the back.

109
00:06:52.251 --> 00:06:56.840
It's like a very deeply researched,
I have a phd in history kind of book,

110
00:06:57.170 --> 00:07:01.220
but it's all buried super duper deep so that the stories can come up.

111
00:07:01.250 --> 00:07:02.750
And if that's what you're trying to do,

112
00:07:02.751 --> 00:07:05.240
you have to have really interesting people to talk about.

113
00:07:05.660 --> 00:07:07.670
So that's how I chose the time.
That's how I chose the people.

114
00:07:07.920 --> 00:07:12.780
<v 1>Oh,
thank you.
I won't ask you who that COO.
I'm guessing that's not good.</v>

115
00:07:12.781 --> 00:07:15.800
I would not tell.
So let's,

116
00:07:16.290 --> 00:07:18.420
so to introduce Mike Markkula so,

117
00:07:18.421 --> 00:07:21.900
well let's maybe briefly introduce the other characters.

118
00:07:21.901 --> 00:07:26.220
Maybe I can read them out and you sort of give us a couple of minor on why,

119
00:07:26.490 --> 00:07:28.970
why Bob Taylor at um,

120
00:07:29.130 --> 00:07:32.220
first of the Pentagon and then Xerox Parc.

121
00:07:32.680 --> 00:07:32.810
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

122
00:07:32.810 --> 00:07:36.860
So Bob Taylor is probably the person in the book who has the widest gap between

123
00:07:36.861 --> 00:07:40.100
how important what he did was and how unknown he is.

124
00:07:40.610 --> 00:07:44.900
Bob Taylor is the guy who convinced the department of Defense to start what

125
00:07:44.901 --> 00:07:49.490
today we call the Internet to start the arpanet.
Then he,

126
00:07:49.491 --> 00:07:50.270
after that,

127
00:07:50.270 --> 00:07:55.270
went to Xerox Park where he ran that lab that came up with all of the components

128
00:07:57.740 --> 00:08:02.180
with their sister lab.
Uh,
the system science lab was the s the sister lab,
um,

129
00:08:02.210 --> 00:08:05.030
that came up with all the components of the modern personal computer,

130
00:08:05.031 --> 00:08:06.380
kind of put them together.

131
00:08:06.560 --> 00:08:10.150
That's the place that with first had the overlapping windows and wizzy wig.
And,

132
00:08:10.400 --> 00:08:15.080
and you know,
the,
the mouse first in place by,
in,
by 1977,

133
00:08:15.081 --> 00:08:18.070
this lab had the ability to have someone in Miami.

134
00:08:18.100 --> 00:08:20.270
I saw a demo of this and knocked my socks off.

135
00:08:20.270 --> 00:08:24.740
Someone in Miami controlling the cursor on the screen of someone in Palo Alto in

136
00:08:24.741 --> 00:08:28.310
1977.
So Taylor round that lab,

137
00:08:28.311 --> 00:08:33.311
that's the lab that Steve Jobs famously visited in 1979 and saw this in action

138
00:08:33.501 --> 00:08:35.270
and said,
hmm,
I want that for apple.

139
00:08:35.271 --> 00:08:40.271
And it moved into the Lisa and then later into the Mac and a Taylor ran this lab

140
00:08:42.620 --> 00:08:43.610
with,
uh,

141
00:08:43.850 --> 00:08:48.590
he had a master's degree in psychology and was running this lab that was so full

142
00:08:48.591 --> 00:08:53.591
of brilliant phd computer scientist that the president of MIT worried allowed

143
00:08:54.681 --> 00:08:54.970
the,

144
00:08:54.970 --> 00:08:58.620
the future of computer science education in the United States was questionable

145
00:08:58.621 --> 00:09:01.980
because everyone great was working for Bob Taylor.

146
00:09:01.981 --> 00:09:04.710
That includes Eric Schmidt of Google,
worked for Taylor,

147
00:09:05.040 --> 00:09:10.040
the cofounders of the Adobe [inaudible] and Warnock worked for Taylor Charles

148
00:09:10.920 --> 00:09:15.270
Simonyi who went on to do the office suite at Microsoft,

149
00:09:15.510 --> 00:09:19.170
worked for Taylor,
uh,
Larry Tesler who's key at APP.
I mean,

150
00:09:19.171 --> 00:09:20.220
you can just go on and on.

151
00:09:20.220 --> 00:09:25.120
Alan Kay was brought to Xerox Parc by Bob Taylor's.
So,

152
00:09:25.121 --> 00:09:29.160
um,
this incredibly important guy.
No one,
no one knows what he did.
Oh.

153
00:09:29.161 --> 00:09:32.880
And then he went onto deck and um,
where they were,

154
00:09:33.210 --> 00:09:37.360
they had alta vista.
One of his researchers was the key guy behind Altavista,

155
00:09:37.440 --> 00:09:41.040
you know,
many years before.
Google was a glimmer in anyone's eye.

156
00:09:41.340 --> 00:09:45.650
So super important.
Yeah.
Al Alcorn.

157
00:09:45.870 --> 00:09:49.980
Al Alcorn,
Al Al Al cording was the designer of a poem,

158
00:09:50.280 --> 00:09:53.100
the first,
uh,
huge video game,
uh,

159
00:09:53.130 --> 00:09:58.060
for Atari and a really interesting guy because he is an engineer engineer's an

160
00:09:58.061 --> 00:09:59.550
engineer.
And a,

161
00:09:59.551 --> 00:10:04.500
I really wanted to be sure to capture the stories of people who are heads down

162
00:10:04.501 --> 00:10:08.370
doing the engineering.
Um,
but again,
fascinating guy,
you know,

163
00:10:08.430 --> 00:10:12.180
had a picture of Lyndon Johnson on his wall in the late sixties and used him for

164
00:10:12.181 --> 00:10:14.730
target practice and very interesting guy,

165
00:10:16.060 --> 00:10:21.060
Fama Alvarez enrollment a fallen Alvarez a is someone when the book opens,

166
00:10:21.471 --> 00:10:24.120
she's 12 years old and she is,
uh,

167
00:10:24.240 --> 00:10:28.410
picking fruit in the orchards that used to be all over silicon,

168
00:10:28.440 --> 00:10:31.230
silicon valley.
It was called the Valley of the heart's delight.

169
00:10:31.860 --> 00:10:36.420
And she is doing this in the bucolic haven of Cupertino,
California.

170
00:10:36.990 --> 00:10:40.830
And she goes on,
she doesn't go to college,

171
00:10:40.831 --> 00:10:43.800
but she gets a job on the manufacturing line at Rome.

172
00:10:44.160 --> 00:10:48.780
Something that most people don't know about a silicon valley is that this used

173
00:10:48.781 --> 00:10:52.920
to be a manufacturing economy.
There were factories here they were,

174
00:10:52.950 --> 00:10:56.870
they were called fabs.
But if they were here and they were,
uh,

175
00:10:56.880 --> 00:11:00.780
they anchored the economy,
uh,
and there were plenty of very,

176
00:11:00.781 --> 00:11:04.860
very good middle class jobs for people who,
uh,

177
00:11:05.070 --> 00:11:08.100
didn't have an education behind a high school degree,

178
00:11:08.490 --> 00:11:10.690
beyond a high school degree.
Excuse me.
And,
uh,

179
00:11:10.691 --> 00:11:13.470
I wanted her story to be there because a,

180
00:11:13.471 --> 00:11:17.430
she illuminates that sort of transition from the orchards to manufacturing.

181
00:11:17.670 --> 00:11:19.450
And then she keeps going,
um,

182
00:11:19.490 --> 00:11:23.700
and ends up as essentially the chief of staff to the president of IBM Rome.

183
00:11:24.060 --> 00:11:24.990
And,
um,

184
00:11:25.110 --> 00:11:29.520
as Rome itself is moving all of its manufacturing out of the area and she moves

185
00:11:29.521 --> 00:11:33.870
much more into the kind of silicon valley jobs that we think of today.

186
00:11:35.820 --> 00:11:40.820
<v 1>These next two are sort of a paired with Niels Niels reamers of Stanford's</v>

187
00:11:41.611 --> 00:11:45.510
Office of Technology Licensing and Bob Swanson of Genentech.

188
00:11:45.650 --> 00:11:49.820
<v 2>Right.
So this,
this,
this is the story of the biotech industry.
I mean,</v>

189
00:11:49.850 --> 00:11:50.660
something that,

190
00:11:50.660 --> 00:11:53.620
it took me six years to write this book and part of the reason it did was that

191
00:11:53.621 --> 00:11:57.170
it's basically six books in one book.
Um,

192
00:11:57.310 --> 00:12:02.310
so Neil's Ramers is the guy who started Stanford's Office of Technology

193
00:12:02.980 --> 00:12:05.320
Licensing.
Uh,
when he got to Stanford,
uh,

194
00:12:05.650 --> 00:12:08.650
he saw in 1970 he saw that,
uh,

195
00:12:08.651 --> 00:12:12.150
the office of tech that Stanford's entire,
uh,

196
00:12:12.550 --> 00:12:16.450
income from the inventions of all of its faculty,

197
00:12:16.451 --> 00:12:21.451
staff and students for the previous 13 years had been $3,000 combined,

198
00:12:22.211 --> 00:12:26.230
about 260 bucks a year.
He decided that didn't make any sense.

199
00:12:26.231 --> 00:12:31.000
He decided to try to start something and he was not a high powered high level

200
00:12:31.001 --> 00:12:34.410
guy who sort of a a mid level staffer.
Um,

201
00:12:34.930 --> 00:12:38.340
and not an attorney either.
And he started the office,
um,

202
00:12:38.380 --> 00:12:42.370
that to date has brought $2 billion into Stanford.

203
00:12:42.700 --> 00:12:46.840
And that office is the reason that Stanford had a stake in Google's search

204
00:12:46.841 --> 00:12:51.841
algorithm and had a nice chunk of equity and Google similar for Vm VM ware.

205
00:12:52.960 --> 00:12:55.110
It's another big one out of Stanford.
Um,

206
00:12:55.130 --> 00:12:58.810
the office of technology licensing and this particular,

207
00:12:58.811 --> 00:13:02.740
this talks about their first really big hit,

208
00:13:02.800 --> 00:13:06.220
which was the patent for recombinant DNA.

209
00:13:06.550 --> 00:13:09.760
The whole notion of patenting,
um,
this,

210
00:13:09.761 --> 00:13:11.770
this process was a radical one.

211
00:13:11.771 --> 00:13:15.330
He faced a lot of challenges and I'm,

212
00:13:15.970 --> 00:13:20.970
one of the people he worked closely with from early on was Bob Swanson,

213
00:13:21.460 --> 00:13:25.150
who's the cofounder of Janine Tech and um,

214
00:13:25.360 --> 00:13:27.940
someone who he had been an associate partner.

215
00:13:28.540 --> 00:13:33.540
He was like a rocket ship superstar guy takes a chance and becomes an associate

216
00:13:34.001 --> 00:13:38.170
partner.
One of the first ones,
maybe the first one,
I'm not sure.
I'm at Kleiner,

217
00:13:38.171 --> 00:13:42.910
Kleiner Perkins Caufield and Byers,
um,
gets fired and decides,

218
00:13:42.911 --> 00:13:43.221
I mean,

219
00:13:43.221 --> 00:13:48.221
it was really rocked back on his heels and decides that he really believes in

220
00:13:48.701 --> 00:13:49.930
this thing he's read about,

221
00:13:49.931 --> 00:13:52.870
which is recombinant DNA is read about it in science magazine.

222
00:13:53.470 --> 00:13:55.780
Can't find anyone to help him start this company,

223
00:13:55.781 --> 00:13:59.230
ends up going on welfare to while he tries to figure it out.

224
00:13:59.231 --> 00:14:03.300
It's very much of a sort of JK Rowling type story and um,

225
00:14:03.460 --> 00:14:07.870
ended up launching a Genentech.
Unbelievable.
Yeah,
that's a great story.

226
00:14:09.420 --> 00:14:14.080
Sandi.
Cursing.
Yeah.
Founder and CEO of ass computer.
Right.
So Sandy,

227
00:14:14.081 --> 00:14:17.860
Kurt's Sig,
uh,
is the first woman to take a tech company public.

228
00:14:18.280 --> 00:14:23.280
She started a software company called [inaudible] in 1972 and I wanted to write

229
00:14:24.251 --> 00:14:29.120
about Sandy.
Um,
primarily because I wanted to write about software.
Uh,

230
00:14:29.290 --> 00:14:32.470
this is the first time,
not just her company,

231
00:14:32.471 --> 00:14:34.890
but this is the time when I'm in,

232
00:14:34.950 --> 00:14:38.170
in the wake of an IBM consent decree.

233
00:14:38.530 --> 00:14:41.200
Software and hardware unbundled from each other.

234
00:14:41.201 --> 00:14:44.290
And so you get these independent little bitty software companies coming up.

235
00:14:45.310 --> 00:14:48.940
This was silicon valley at a time when I just said they were building things.

236
00:14:48.940 --> 00:14:50.320
It was a hardware place.

237
00:14:50.350 --> 00:14:55.350
And even Larry Ellison who started oracle at around this exact same time talked

238
00:14:55.881 --> 00:14:57.440
about how he couldn't give,

239
00:14:57.710 --> 00:15:02.330
get anyone to pay attention to his entreaties to give him money to start a

240
00:15:02.331 --> 00:15:04.490
software company.
He said that people would,

241
00:15:04.730 --> 00:15:07.370
the venture capitals just laughed him out of the office.

242
00:15:07.790 --> 00:15:12.790
And so sandy was interesting to me because she's an outsider because she's doing

243
00:15:12.921 --> 00:15:16.950
software and she's an outsider because she's a woman.
So,
uh,

244
00:15:17.030 --> 00:15:19.760
people literally think when she said she's selling software,

245
00:15:19.761 --> 00:15:24.530
that she's selling lingerie.
And so,
um,
her story,

246
00:15:24.531 --> 00:15:29.531
she's someone who comes up kind of outside of these famed networks that,

247
00:15:29.800 --> 00:15:34.330
that other people that like Mike Markkula was able to bring apple into.

248
00:15:34.340 --> 00:15:37.010
If you look at Apple's s one at their IPO,

249
00:15:37.760 --> 00:15:42.760
almost every single senior exec plus they're a funders,

250
00:15:43.010 --> 00:15:47.270
all had ties through mark [inaudible] to the semiconductor industry,

251
00:15:47.510 --> 00:15:49.630
not the case for sandy curtsying.

252
00:15:49.640 --> 00:15:53.300
She bootstrapped it from her kitchen table and,
um,

253
00:15:54.110 --> 00:15:58.430
HP gave them time on their computers late,

254
00:15:58.431 --> 00:15:59.240
late at night.

255
00:15:59.240 --> 00:16:03.650
That was sort of her as close as she came to tapping into this network.

256
00:16:03.920 --> 00:16:04.371
And again,

257
00:16:04.371 --> 00:16:08.150
was a story I wanted to pull out because HP now has really diminished in

258
00:16:08.151 --> 00:16:10.340
people's understanding of its importance.

259
00:16:10.730 --> 00:16:15.350
But they brought up so many dozens of these little software companies couldn't

260
00:16:15.351 --> 00:16:17.960
afford computers.
They were hundreds of thousands of dollars.

261
00:16:17.961 --> 00:16:19.910
How could you possibly afford one of those?

262
00:16:20.210 --> 00:16:23.180
But you could go in after hours at HP,
literally,

263
00:16:23.181 --> 00:16:27.830
you could bring a sleeping bag and sleep on a floor in the closet and use their

264
00:16:27.831 --> 00:16:32.670
computers to try to debug your code.
So it was,
it was an exciting story too.
Yeah,

265
00:16:32.760 --> 00:16:33.593
that's great.

266
00:16:35.450 --> 00:16:37.480
<v 1>Arguably one of the earliest,
uh,</v>

267
00:16:37.550 --> 00:16:40.340
independent software vendors as they used to be known or ISV.

268
00:16:40.610 --> 00:16:45.440
<v 2>Yeah,
exactly.
In the applications business.
It's funny we've gone back to that.</v>

269
00:16:45.441 --> 00:16:46.850
That's how they talked about themselves

270
00:16:46.920 --> 00:16:49.180
<v 1>then.
Indeed.
So,
um,</v>

271
00:16:49.260 --> 00:16:54.260
with your background in history and you note there's five major industries in

272
00:16:54.301 --> 00:16:54.901
seven years,

273
00:16:54.901 --> 00:16:59.460
between 1969 and 1976 that are born,

274
00:16:59.490 --> 00:17:02.970
they are the personal computing,
video games,
biotech,

275
00:17:03.330 --> 00:17:07.590
modern venture capital and advanced semiconductor industries.

276
00:17:08.370 --> 00:17:11.670
As you look back and other other times in history,

277
00:17:11.671 --> 00:17:15.960
has there ever been another time like this in terms of the kind of
inventiveness,

278
00:17:15.961 --> 00:17:16.794
how does it,
how does it,

279
00:17:17.570 --> 00:17:22.570
<v 2>I didn't come up with anything that was really comparable in terms of the</v>

280
00:17:23.610 --> 00:17:25.200
breadth and impact.

281
00:17:25.201 --> 00:17:29.250
I mean that is just when you look at where we are today,

282
00:17:29.580 --> 00:17:30.211
it's,

283
00:17:30.211 --> 00:17:35.211
you can trace so much of it back to this tiny little place and this little

284
00:17:35.671 --> 00:17:37.140
period of time.

285
00:17:37.141 --> 00:17:41.940
And I think that to me it was unrivaled and actually points to,

286
00:17:41.941 --> 00:17:45.360
one of the things that I always think is so interesting about silicon valley,

287
00:17:45.390 --> 00:17:50.390
which is that this has been the of so many different things.

288
00:17:50.671 --> 00:17:53.700
In this case,
I'm talking about one generation,
but you know,

289
00:17:53.701 --> 00:17:56.670
people always want to understand,
people come to Stanford all the time.

290
00:17:56.671 --> 00:17:58.770
Why did Silicon Valley gets started here?

291
00:17:59.070 --> 00:18:04.020
But to me a much more interesting question is why is Silicon Valley still going?

292
00:18:04.260 --> 00:18:07.680
I mean,
Hewlett Packard started in 1939,

293
00:18:07.920 --> 00:18:12.920
why is it still going and why have there been so many different generations of

294
00:18:14.161 --> 00:18:16.830
technology that have come out of this place?
Because I mean,

295
00:18:17.190 --> 00:18:21.570
you start with HP and with instrumentation and then you're into the chips and

296
00:18:21.571 --> 00:18:25.860
then you're into the sort of the stuff I'm talking about consumer electronics

297
00:18:25.861 --> 00:18:29.490
and biotech,
and then you're into networking and then you leave.

298
00:18:29.620 --> 00:18:31.680
You can just kind of keep going forward.
And then,
you know,

299
00:18:31.681 --> 00:18:36.460
we're in cloud and mobile and search and cars or your,
you know,
it's just,

300
00:18:36.660 --> 00:18:41.250
and so how you,
how did all that happen?
And I think that,
um,

301
00:18:42.030 --> 00:18:46.830
one of the,
I always point to two things actually.
I mean,
one is the,

302
00:18:46.860 --> 00:18:51.850
the uh,
role of people doing what Mike Markkula did in this book.
Um,

303
00:18:51.900 --> 00:18:56.520
when,
when jobs,
uh,
spoke at Stanford in 2005,

304
00:18:56.521 --> 00:19:01.521
he talked about when he was fired from apple and how the first thing he did was

305
00:19:02.101 --> 00:19:05.070
pick up the phone and call Bob Noyce,

306
00:19:05.071 --> 00:19:09.040
who's the subject of my first book in a Co founder of Intel,
um,

307
00:19:09.300 --> 00:19:10.710
and David Packard.

308
00:19:10.710 --> 00:19:15.690
And he said that he appalled jobs that I apologized for dropping the baton and

309
00:19:15.691 --> 00:19:19.890
he had this sense of sort of this relay race across time,
you know,

310
00:19:19.980 --> 00:19:22.770
generation to generation handing off the baton.

311
00:19:23.100 --> 00:19:27.060
And I think that's been such an important part of silicon valley history.

312
00:19:27.270 --> 00:19:31.260
And I think that,
um,
in some sense,
you know,

313
00:19:31.530 --> 00:19:35.490
part of what I hope this book can serve as is a baton pass,
sort of like,
well,

314
00:19:35.491 --> 00:19:37.380
here's how this generation did it.

315
00:19:37.890 --> 00:19:41.460
And then the second thing that I always point to is how important immigrants

316
00:19:41.461 --> 00:19:44.220
have been to the rise of Silicon Valley.

317
00:19:44.250 --> 00:19:49.250
It's a basically in the time that I'm writing about,

318
00:19:49.800 --> 00:19:51.210
we're still,

319
00:19:51.570 --> 00:19:54.990
people are coming here from other parts of the world.

320
00:19:55.370 --> 00:19:59.580
I mean from other parts of the United States at an insane rate.
Uh,
just,

321
00:19:59.620 --> 00:20:04.620
it was if a new person moved into silicon valley every half hour for 20 years

322
00:20:06.331 --> 00:20:08.160
straight and no one moved out.

323
00:20:08.160 --> 00:20:11.550
I mean that's the pace at which people were coming into the valley,

324
00:20:11.790 --> 00:20:15.690
mostly from other parts of the country.
Now they come from all over the world,

325
00:20:15.780 --> 00:20:17.610
but the effect has been exactly the same,

326
00:20:17.611 --> 00:20:22.440
which is this constant refresh into the system of new ideas,

327
00:20:22.620 --> 00:20:25.530
the best and brightest,
and very often the biggest risk takers.

328
00:20:25.531 --> 00:20:30.210
Because I mean what it takes to pick up and leave,
leave your,
your country,

329
00:20:30.211 --> 00:20:34.230
often your language,
your family,
your home for,
you know,

330
00:20:34.231 --> 00:20:37.830
to try to do something really different is so important.

331
00:20:37.831 --> 00:20:41.940
And at this point we've got two thirds of the people working in science and tech

332
00:20:42.000 --> 00:20:45.330
in silicon valley are born outside of the United States.

333
00:20:45.630 --> 00:20:48.820
So that's been another sort of secret to the,

334
00:20:48.821 --> 00:20:51.070
to the valley's success.

335
00:20:51.130 --> 00:20:54.940
And I think that while I can't see,
you know,

336
00:20:55.000 --> 00:20:58.990
a comparable time period,
um,
for this book,

337
00:20:58.991 --> 00:21:03.991
I feel like in some ways it was almost like the firing gun for everything that

338
00:21:05.831 --> 00:21:06.664
has come since.

339
00:21:08.100 --> 00:21:09.860
<v 1>Yeah,
that's great.
Maybe that's a good,</v>

340
00:21:10.350 --> 00:21:15.260
good a place to ask you to read an excerpt.
Um,
and set the scene.

341
00:21:15.440 --> 00:21:19.490
A bunch of us live in Silicon Valley here and you mentioned the orchards and

342
00:21:19.910 --> 00:21:21.590
manufacturing.
Um,

343
00:21:21.650 --> 00:21:25.430
I'd love to ask you to read a passage from the book that maybe gives us a sense

344
00:21:25.431 --> 00:21:29.290
of what it was like at the end of the sixties,
early seventies.
And,

345
00:21:29.650 --> 00:21:33.650
and you know what that's from a formative period was like,
if,
if you don't mind,

346
00:21:33.720 --> 00:21:38.280
<v 2>great.
We talked about this in advanced,
so I haven't marked,
um,
yeah,</v>

347
00:21:38.281 --> 00:21:40.120
so this as,

348
00:21:40.230 --> 00:21:45.120
so the way the book is organized I should explain is it has what I think of as

349
00:21:45.121 --> 00:21:48.810
core samples.
It's different time periods.
So it's,

350
00:21:48.811 --> 00:21:50.370
I've got all of these seven people.

351
00:21:50.760 --> 00:21:53.370
One way you could have done this book is talking about person a,

352
00:21:53.820 --> 00:21:56.460
here's what they were doing,
1969,
we're going to follow them all the way through.

353
00:21:56.461 --> 00:21:58.620
Now we're going to move our person B all the way through.

354
00:21:59.550 --> 00:22:04.550
That to me was going to lose the magic of the story,

355
00:22:04.710 --> 00:22:08.400
which is that these people's lives,
they just keep kind of overlapping.
I mean,

356
00:22:08.401 --> 00:22:12.390
you just like Don Valentine shows up again and again and again.

357
00:22:12.391 --> 00:22:13.710
And he had Larry Cincy me,

358
00:22:13.711 --> 00:22:15.780
he's here and he's here and he's here at Regis Mckenna.

359
00:22:15.781 --> 00:22:20.310
They just the same people.
And so I wanted to make sure in order,

360
00:22:20.460 --> 00:22:25.410
venture capitalists,
attorney,
a Pr Guy,
uh,
the best in the business,

361
00:22:25.411 --> 00:22:26.580
all of them.
Um,

362
00:22:27.390 --> 00:22:31.710
I wanted to find a way to overlap those stories.
So I,

363
00:22:31.830 --> 00:22:36.830
I tell where everyone is in each time period and I start those time periods with

364
00:22:37.411 --> 00:22:41.280
a sort of,
you are here,
this is what silicon valley was like at this time.

365
00:22:41.310 --> 00:22:45.780
So this is,
since this is for that sort of 1972 to 75 time period.

366
00:22:46.170 --> 00:22:50.640
Um,
and it says,
I'll just read you it.
Uh,
in 1971,

367
00:22:50.641 --> 00:22:54.780
a hard drinking reporter named Don Heffler published a three part history of the

368
00:22:54.781 --> 00:22:59.280
men money and litigation behind the semiconductor business.

369
00:22:59.430 --> 00:23:00.570
He titled The series,

370
00:23:00.571 --> 00:23:03.780
which appeared in an industry newsletter called electronic news,

371
00:23:04.020 --> 00:23:05.790
Silicon Valley USA.

372
00:23:06.570 --> 00:23:10.920
It was the first formal use of a name that had for years been bandied about

373
00:23:10.921 --> 00:23:11.970
inside the valley.

374
00:23:12.810 --> 00:23:16.230
No one was beyond the readers of electronic news took notice of the new

375
00:23:16.231 --> 00:23:19.980
technology reason that had been born on the San Francisco Peninsula.

376
00:23:20.430 --> 00:23:23.430
Individual companies have begun to attract outside interests.

377
00:23:23.430 --> 00:23:27.330
So Intel had it's IPO and that same year,
1971,

378
00:23:27.720 --> 00:23:31.320
but it would be three years before any major national publication wrote about

379
00:23:31.321 --> 00:23:34.650
the peninsula as a distinct technology based region.

380
00:23:35.220 --> 00:23:39.120
It years would pass before the name is silicon valley gained widespread use.

381
00:23:39.121 --> 00:23:40.230
And it's actually really funny.

382
00:23:40.231 --> 00:23:44.220
All the other names that people came up with is like silicon gulch semiconductor

383
00:23:44.221 --> 00:23:47.700
country semiconductor country's pretty good.
Uh,

384
00:23:48.020 --> 00:23:49.970
in the early 1970s,

385
00:23:49.971 --> 00:23:53.960
silicon valley startup companies were largely deemed irrelevant to the real

386
00:23:53.961 --> 00:23:55.580
business of the United States,

387
00:23:55.820 --> 00:24:00.290
which was concentrated in east coast financial centers in cities such as Detroit

388
00:24:00.291 --> 00:24:03.860
and Pittsburgh and Chicago that had a manufacturing at their core,

389
00:24:04.460 --> 00:24:06.740
the nation's new mini computer companies.

390
00:24:06.741 --> 00:24:10.430
These were kind of the hot thing that everyone knew about were all clustered

391
00:24:10.431 --> 00:24:15.431
around MIT and Harvard along Boston's route one 28 and stay okay.

392
00:24:15.921 --> 00:24:19.640
So here's what was going on.
Stanford's reputation was on the rise,

393
00:24:19.641 --> 00:24:24.170
which we know because it was beginning to be called the Harvard of the West.
Um,

394
00:24:24.200 --> 00:24:27.950
but still the university attracted mostly students from California.

395
00:24:28.520 --> 00:24:31.130
San Francisco was best known for its hippies.

396
00:24:31.640 --> 00:24:36.640
Palo Alto was fighting its reputation as quote the peninsulas largest sex shops

397
00:24:37.541 --> 00:24:38.374
center,

398
00:24:38.450 --> 00:24:42.710
thanks to an eight block stretch of El Camino rail near the city southern border

399
00:24:42.950 --> 00:24:45.230
that was home to multiple adult bookstores,

400
00:24:45.231 --> 00:24:49.970
an x rated movie theater and a massage and massage parlors with names such as

401
00:24:50.060 --> 00:24:54.800
the streaker and the foxy lady.
This is down the street from my first house.

402
00:24:54.801 --> 00:24:59.600
Actually none of this pointed to a promising future as an economic powerhouse.

403
00:25:00.770 --> 00:25:04.100
The rest of the business world might not have noticed,
but inside silicon valley,

404
00:25:04.101 --> 00:25:09.101
things were brewing in 1972 the previous year until had invented the

405
00:25:09.111 --> 00:25:10.190
microprocessor,

406
00:25:10.191 --> 00:25:13.700
the chip that would soon nessel at the heart of consumer electronics such as the

407
00:25:13.701 --> 00:25:16.370
personal computer and video games.
Meanwhile,

408
00:25:16.371 --> 00:25:19.880
Hewlett Packard became the first silicon valley company to discover that an

409
00:25:19.881 --> 00:25:23.270
advanced electronic device could have broad consumer appeal.

410
00:25:23.780 --> 00:25:28.780
In 1972 the company introduced the HP 35 the world's first handheld calculator

411
00:25:29.961 --> 00:25:33.350
that could do more than add,
subtract,
multiply and divide.

412
00:25:33.920 --> 00:25:38.920
HP sold more than a hundred thousand in the first year despite a $400 price tag,

413
00:25:39.411 --> 00:25:43.940
which is a very significant price bag.
This was my favorite part,

414
00:25:43.970 --> 00:25:48.970
a cheeky chapter called shirt pocket power in the owner's manual noted.

415
00:25:49.400 --> 00:25:49.820
We,

416
00:25:49.820 --> 00:25:54.440
we thought you'd like to have something only fictional heroes like James Bond,

417
00:25:54.441 --> 00:25:58.850
Walter Mitty or Dick Tracy are supposed to own for a pocket calculator.

418
00:25:58.851 --> 00:26:00.980
I just love that.
Um,
for the most part,

419
00:26:00.981 --> 00:26:04.670
these developments within silicon valley happened independently of one another,

420
00:26:05.030 --> 00:26:08.240
but like different streams that feed a swift moving river,

421
00:26:08.570 --> 00:26:11.300
the work would student begin to blend and swirled together.

422
00:26:11.480 --> 00:26:14.930
The resulting network of personal and institutional connections would form the

423
00:26:14.931 --> 00:26:19.250
foundation of today's silicon valley and the high technology revolution.

424
00:26:19.880 --> 00:26:23.490
So that's sort of like,
that's where we were,
you know,
and,
and look,

425
00:26:23.570 --> 00:26:24.500
look where we are now.

426
00:26:24.770 --> 00:26:26.900
A little bit different for those of you that live in the area,

427
00:26:26.990 --> 00:26:30.360
a little different,
a picture of the local environment,
uh,

428
00:26:30.740 --> 00:26:32.220
back in the early seventies.
Yeah.

429
00:26:32.221 --> 00:26:36.560
And especially people looking at the valley from the east coast.
I mean,
it's,

430
00:26:36.561 --> 00:26:40.490
it's amazing.
Um,
in the book you mainly see this because Xerox is,

431
00:26:40.880 --> 00:26:45.210
is headquartered on the east coast and they're,

432
00:26:45.211 --> 00:26:50.190
so they're looking at these crazies in Palo Alto who,

433
00:26:50.280 --> 00:26:52.920
I mean,
this is a company who makes,
I mean,

434
00:26:53.040 --> 00:26:57.600
almost all of their profits came from the paper that they sold with the xerox

435
00:26:57.601 --> 00:27:00.180
machines.
And here they've got this,

436
00:27:00.600 --> 00:27:05.400
this research lab that's gone completely rogue and is trying to figure out how

437
00:27:05.401 --> 00:27:06.234
do we even,

438
00:27:06.270 --> 00:27:10.230
how do we start doing all the important stuff before it ever even hits the paper

439
00:27:10.620 --> 00:27:13.350
and their descriptions of Xerox,

440
00:27:13.420 --> 00:27:16.680
of Xerox Park and this area are hilarious.

441
00:27:16.681 --> 00:27:20.460
I mean they're just sort of like everyone eats tofu there.

442
00:27:20.640 --> 00:27:24.570
People Jog,
you know,
I mean it's just,
it's just,
it's,

443
00:27:24.600 --> 00:27:29.280
it's amazing to see,
um,
how suspicious people were.
You know,

444
00:27:29.281 --> 00:27:30.870
I mean they were watching the television,

445
00:27:30.871 --> 00:27:35.790
they were seeing what was going on in San Francisco and you know,
people,

446
00:27:35.820 --> 00:27:40.140
these protests in Berkeley and cause the Vietnam war is just an ad.

447
00:27:40.141 --> 00:27:45.141
Its height had a huge implication for what happened here because so many people

448
00:27:45.151 --> 00:27:46.740
who would have gone,

449
00:27:46.741 --> 00:27:49.050
if you think that people were a graphics expert at this time,

450
00:27:49.051 --> 00:27:49.801
what were you going to do?

451
00:27:49.801 --> 00:27:52.500
You were going to go work for the Department of Defense almost certainly,

452
00:27:52.501 --> 00:27:54.210
or maybe a subcontractor,

453
00:27:54.720 --> 00:27:57.390
but all the sudden you have these people coming out of school and they don't

454
00:27:57.391 --> 00:27:59.580
want anything to do with the dod.

455
00:27:59.640 --> 00:28:02.670
They don't want anything to do with the war that's happening.

456
00:28:03.210 --> 00:28:08.210
And that is to the gain of places like Xerox Parc and Atari and you know,

457
00:28:08.700 --> 00:28:10.270
eventually apple.
This,
the,

458
00:28:10.860 --> 00:28:15.860
the Silicon Valley's history really too often for my money is told in total

459
00:28:16.741 --> 00:28:19.950
isolation from what's going on in the rest of the country,

460
00:28:19.951 --> 00:28:23.880
much less the rest of the world.
And so this is a great example of why it,

461
00:28:24.060 --> 00:28:24.721
why it mattered.

462
00:28:24.721 --> 00:28:27.750
Who would've thought that would've been a consequence of the Vietnam war?

463
00:28:27.751 --> 00:28:28.584
But it really was

464
00:28:28.820 --> 00:28:33.820
<v 1>all the interleaving affects that lead to these different companies.</v>

465
00:28:34.521 --> 00:28:38.840
It's amazing to think about,
um,
since you mentioned the Xerox Parc,

466
00:28:39.380 --> 00:28:42.800
um,
I've always been fascinated with their history.
So many,
uh,

467
00:28:42.860 --> 00:28:47.860
so many core technological inventions came from there and from the assemblage of

468
00:28:47.990 --> 00:28:50.600
amazing talent that Bob Taylor brought together,

469
00:28:51.080 --> 00:28:55.490
yet they failed to commercialize those inventions.

470
00:28:55.491 --> 00:29:00.020
And so I'm curious,
what's your perspective on why did Xerox Fail?
Was it,

471
00:29:00.050 --> 00:29:05.000
was it some of this,
this skepticism towards Silicon Valley and the West Coast?

472
00:29:05.060 --> 00:29:09.230
And also,
how did Bob Taylor think about that?
Was he troubled by,

473
00:29:09.630 --> 00:29:13.580
um,
the fact that Xerox never reap the benefits of the,

474
00:29:13.581 --> 00:29:17.720
of the inventions that,
uh,
that came from,
from his operation?

475
00:29:18.050 --> 00:29:21.110
<v 2>Yeah.
So I mean,
this is called a fumbling.</v>

476
00:29:21.111 --> 00:29:26.111
The future is the term everyone uses for a very nasty book about Xerox.

477
00:29:27.260 --> 00:29:30.440
Xerox fumbled the future because the argument goes,

478
00:29:31.070 --> 00:29:33.080
apple could have been xerox's,

479
00:29:33.260 --> 00:29:36.820
Adobe could have been xerox's Microsoft and you know,

480
00:29:36.830 --> 00:29:40.340
certainly everything that followed in the wake of windows could have,

481
00:29:40.400 --> 00:29:43.060
could have to xerox.
Um,

482
00:29:44.020 --> 00:29:47.050
so that's the argument hadn't Allen's question is how did,

483
00:29:47.080 --> 00:29:49.720
how did Xerox fumbled the future?
Um,

484
00:29:49.721 --> 00:29:54.130
so xerox would very quickly point out we did not fumble the future.
Um,

485
00:29:54.160 --> 00:29:55.270
the printer,

486
00:29:55.600 --> 00:30:00.430
the laser printer is another thing that was in print invented add xerox parc

487
00:30:00.490 --> 00:30:01.420
again with,

488
00:30:01.450 --> 00:30:06.450
with basically with a refugee from a different part of Xerox who had this idea

489
00:30:06.731 --> 00:30:11.220
to do this and they didn't want to do it.
And Taylor's like,
come,

490
00:30:11.470 --> 00:30:14.360
come to us,
we will help you do this.
Um,

491
00:30:14.410 --> 00:30:19.410
so xerox commercialized the laser printer and made back way more money than they

492
00:30:20.051 --> 00:30:21.460
ever spent on Xerox Park.

493
00:30:21.460 --> 00:30:26.460
So they would completely say that as irrelevant question and it makes perfect

494
00:30:26.681 --> 00:30:31.510
sense that a company whose entire business model ran on paper would actually

495
00:30:31.511 --> 00:30:35.110
commercialize the one thing that came out of this place that used up paper.

496
00:30:35.111 --> 00:30:39.630
Right.
Which was a printer.
So,
um,
they would,
they would object to that,
uh,

497
00:30:39.640 --> 00:30:44.110
for sure.
And with some,
some legitimacy.
Um,
I think that,

498
00:30:44.170 --> 00:30:46.210
uh,
they,

499
00:30:48.400 --> 00:30:53.400
no one in the world could hold on to the talent and ideas that were coming out

500
00:30:53.441 --> 00:30:56.680
of that place.
This is silicon valley has these places.

501
00:30:56.830 --> 00:30:59.290
So the first one was Fairchild semiconductor,

502
00:30:59.291 --> 00:31:02.980
which was just with this incredible compression.

503
00:31:02.981 --> 00:31:06.010
Is there like a of of brilliance,
right?

504
00:31:06.011 --> 00:31:10.450
So you look at the eight founders of Fairchild and among them are Bob Noyce who

505
00:31:10.480 --> 00:31:13.420
co-invented the microchip and his partner,
Gordon Moore,

506
00:31:13.421 --> 00:31:15.190
who goes on to start Intel with him.

507
00:31:15.191 --> 00:31:19.870
And Eugene Kleiner who starts Kleiner Perkins and John Air Knee,

508
00:31:19.871 --> 00:31:22.630
who invents the planar process,

509
00:31:22.631 --> 00:31:27.430
which is underpinning still chip manufacturing today.
And you just keep going.

510
00:31:27.431 --> 00:31:31.480
I mean,
the people who worked at Fairchild in include Don Valentine,

511
00:31:31.481 --> 00:31:36.220
Charlie's spork,
the companies that came out of it or Intel,
AMD national.

512
00:31:36.221 --> 00:31:40.080
I mean you can just kind of keep going.
Well,
I mean that company just went ooh.

513
00:31:40.750 --> 00:31:45.750
And it was like the seed pods kind of scattering its seeds all over the area

514
00:31:46.481 --> 00:31:48.250
that then became the chip industry.

515
00:31:48.670 --> 00:31:51.550
Xerox Parc was another one of those places in more recent memory.

516
00:31:51.551 --> 00:31:56.020
Paypal's another one of those places that just sort of does great things when

517
00:31:56.021 --> 00:31:56.771
it's together.

518
00:31:56.771 --> 00:32:01.771
And then the founders and the key employees kind of go on to populate what

519
00:32:01.901 --> 00:32:05.220
happens next and this and this.
It just happens.
I what happens,

520
00:32:05.230 --> 00:32:09.980
so Taylor could not have given a darn about,
um,

521
00:32:10.630 --> 00:32:13.840
whether his stuff got commercialized.
He really felt,

522
00:32:14.080 --> 00:32:18.940
he believed that the main interesting thing in this world was research.

523
00:32:19.150 --> 00:32:24.150
If you want to waste your time on marketing and lawyers and money and finances,

524
00:32:25.870 --> 00:32:28.120
fine with him.
But he didn't care.
I mean,

525
00:32:28.121 --> 00:32:32.230
I asked him once about the money that he made because,
I mean,

526
00:32:32.740 --> 00:32:36.090
I just told you all the people who came from his company and they all,
well,

527
00:32:36.280 --> 00:32:37.390
they all loved him.

528
00:32:37.420 --> 00:32:42.420
He undoubtedly had the ability invest in all of the companies I just laid out on

529
00:32:42.651 --> 00:32:43.484
the ground floor.

530
00:32:43.670 --> 00:32:47.420
And he had so little interest in money that he started talking about his 401k

531
00:32:47.421 --> 00:32:50.240
plan.
Like he didn't get what I was talking about.
That just didn't,

532
00:32:50.270 --> 00:32:53.450
isn't what kind of floated his boat.
But when it,

533
00:32:53.510 --> 00:32:56.740
when his people started leaving because people,

534
00:32:56.900 --> 00:32:59.840
engineers and these computer scientists,

535
00:32:59.841 --> 00:33:03.320
they don't want to build something that gets buried and no one ever uses it when

536
00:33:03.321 --> 00:33:07.790
they know it's incredible.
They want it.
And when,
when his people started leaving,

537
00:33:08.090 --> 00:33:12.920
then he lost it.
He was furious.
He was so angry.
Um,

538
00:33:13.190 --> 00:33:14.390
that's so,
yeah.

539
00:33:14.540 --> 00:33:18.620
<v 1>Yeah.
No,
I think really one of the,
like the world's great research labs,</v>

540
00:33:19.150 --> 00:33:22.160
um,
and,
uh,
some things never change,
right?

541
00:33:22.280 --> 00:33:25.730
Engineers want their products used by not only millions these days,

542
00:33:25.731 --> 00:33:29.030
but the billions possible with the internet.
So,

543
00:33:29.180 --> 00:33:32.350
<v 2>and a number of the sort of gray beards even now at,</v>

544
00:33:32.480 --> 00:33:35.210
at Google who are just sort of doing the research.
I,
those are,

545
00:33:35.330 --> 00:33:38.600
those are tailored,
they worked for Bob tailored.
Bob had a,

546
00:33:38.930 --> 00:33:42.890
he hosted a tomato fest in his yard every year

547
00:33:43.260 --> 00:33:43.920
<v 3>and it was</v>

548
00:33:43.920 --> 00:33:48.070
<v 2>like,
here come the Turing award winners and here comes,
you know,</v>

549
00:33:48.071 --> 00:33:51.240
like a major mind buying Google translate and here,
you know,
here they are,

550
00:33:51.270 --> 00:33:55.380
they're all just kind of descending into his backyard.
It was incredible.

551
00:33:55.381 --> 00:33:57.350
It's like a magnet,
you know?
Huh.

552
00:33:57.700 --> 00:33:59.750
<v 1>For talent.
Yeah.
Right.
Um,</v>

553
00:33:59.751 --> 00:34:03.400
so I wanna I wanna ask you about the two women that you profile and obviously a

554
00:34:03.401 --> 00:34:08.330
lot of talk these days about women in Silicon Valley underrepresentation.
Um,

555
00:34:08.390 --> 00:34:09.230
I'd love to ask you,

556
00:34:09.231 --> 00:34:13.460
what's the same and what has changed from earlier times,

557
00:34:13.550 --> 00:34:18.350
uh,
about being a woman in tech and in Silicon Valley from your perspective?

558
00:34:18.560 --> 00:34:20.390
<v 2>Yeah,
I appreciate that question.</v>

559
00:34:20.391 --> 00:34:25.391
Being asked in that same versus different as opposed to better versus worse.

560
00:34:26.240 --> 00:34:30.800
Um,
because that's a really tough question to answer.
So,
um,

561
00:34:35.520 --> 00:34:39.590
I would say it,
it has never been easy for women in,

562
00:34:40.000 --> 00:34:44.970
in tech,
in silicon valley,
but for different reasons now than then.

563
00:34:44.971 --> 00:34:46.770
So,
um,

564
00:34:47.550 --> 00:34:51.120
the things that the women in my book had to put up with,

565
00:34:51.121 --> 00:34:54.300
and I interviewed a number of women because the women were there.

566
00:34:54.550 --> 00:34:58.170
I mean they were designing the video games,
they were programming the computers.

567
00:34:58.171 --> 00:35:02.850
They were really like inventing the icons on the Mac,
but,
um,

568
00:35:03.210 --> 00:35:08.210
they were not brought to the surface at all in,

569
00:35:08.421 --> 00:35:09.570
in a lot of these stories.

570
00:35:09.571 --> 00:35:13.320
So I talked to a lot more women than are just in the book who are hitting,

571
00:35:13.321 --> 00:35:13.560
you know,

572
00:35:13.560 --> 00:35:18.560
the subject of the book and the things that they faced I would make would curl

573
00:35:19.621 --> 00:35:21.330
your hair.
I mean,
I can't even,

574
00:35:21.360 --> 00:35:24.000
it's one of those things where like I can't speak about this in front of a

575
00:35:24.001 --> 00:35:28.770
family friendly audience and I didn't actually put a lot of it in the book.
Um,

576
00:35:28.800 --> 00:35:30.950
but there are things that I put in the book like,
uh,

577
00:35:31.050 --> 00:35:36.050
the literally pornographic short story that Atari published written by one of

578
00:35:36.661 --> 00:35:40.980
its in the company newsletter.
And,
um,
just,
you know,

579
00:35:40.981 --> 00:35:45.981
hot tub parties that the board meetings were held in hot tubs.

580
00:35:46.261 --> 00:35:48.640
I mean,
it's very,
very,
um,

581
00:35:48.660 --> 00:35:52.230
behavior that in some ways looks super familiar to the worst stories we're

582
00:35:52.231 --> 00:35:54.780
hearing now.
Um,

583
00:35:54.990 --> 00:35:59.990
but what's really was really hard for me to get my mind around really hard is

584
00:36:00.870 --> 00:36:05.870
that this was happening at a time when the surrounding culture was so different

585
00:36:07.591 --> 00:36:11.580
in a lot of ways from how it is now.
So I mean,
in the,
in the mid seventies,

586
00:36:11.581 --> 00:36:14.940
I was 1974,
1975 before a woman,

587
00:36:15.570 --> 00:36:19.740
a married woman could just get a credit card in her own name without her,

588
00:36:19.800 --> 00:36:21.510
you know,
her husband's permission.

589
00:36:21.511 --> 00:36:26.511
And it was 1980 before the EOC recognized sexual harassment in the workplace.

590
00:36:27.420 --> 00:36:32.420
And so the overriding culture was such that when,

591
00:36:33.810 --> 00:36:37.620
like when IBM showed women using computers,
which they did,

592
00:36:37.621 --> 00:36:41.700
and their sort of their flagship,
um,
offices in New York,

593
00:36:42.270 --> 00:36:45.270
the women doing the work because it was their job,

594
00:36:45.271 --> 00:36:48.780
we're told that they were being put in the window because then it would be clear

595
00:36:48.781 --> 00:36:52.260
to men that this was easy to do.
And,
um,

596
00:36:53.100 --> 00:36:54.570
the women I talked to [inaudible]

597
00:36:55.800 --> 00:36:56.633
<v 1>okay.</v>

598
00:36:56.830 --> 00:36:59.410
<v 2>I would say that with such explicit sexual harassment,</v>

599
00:36:59.411 --> 00:37:03.370
I can't believe the things that these people said and did and they'd say,
oh no,

600
00:37:03.371 --> 00:37:06.910
that was just so and so.
He's a jerk or,
you know,
then,
you know,

601
00:37:06.940 --> 00:37:10.750
everyone was doing that.
And so it's,
it's,
so was it,

602
00:37:11.050 --> 00:37:14.350
was it harder for them?
I don't know,

603
00:37:14.351 --> 00:37:18.490
because the expectations were so different and these surroundings were so

604
00:37:18.491 --> 00:37:21.580
different.
It really was a,
a tough,

605
00:37:21.610 --> 00:37:23.110
you can hear from the women talking about it now.

606
00:37:23.111 --> 00:37:26.410
It's still kind of hard for me to get my mind around.
Um,

607
00:37:26.440 --> 00:37:30.850
Sandy Kurt Sig said that it's Amy Kurtz curtsying who was mistaken for a booth

608
00:37:30.851 --> 00:37:33.570
bay because she was very beautiful and told to,
you know,

609
00:37:33.650 --> 00:37:38.570
get coffee for people when she was the CEO that they were trying to sell to.
Um,

610
00:37:39.220 --> 00:37:39.431
you know,

611
00:37:39.431 --> 00:37:43.000
she said that the fact that she was the boss made all the difference in the

612
00:37:43.001 --> 00:37:46.600
world,
right?
She,
she was calling the shots.
And so,
I mean,

613
00:37:46.601 --> 00:37:50.050
I think that sort of speaks to something that a lot of people are talking about

614
00:37:50.051 --> 00:37:53.800
now with being,
you know,
one of the possible among them,

615
00:37:53.860 --> 00:37:57.970
the constellation of many solutions,
we have to come up with them.
Leadership.

616
00:37:58.150 --> 00:38:00.640
Yeah,
that's exactly right.
And I think,
I mean,

617
00:38:00.641 --> 00:38:05.140
kind of getting back to that baton pass image of Steve Jobs,
I mean,

618
00:38:05.141 --> 00:38:06.700
the question of,
okay,

619
00:38:06.701 --> 00:38:10.900
how do we make sure they're a whole lot of Bhutan's going all at once and that

620
00:38:10.901 --> 00:38:15.250
they're being handed off,
not just to the usual suspects and you know,

621
00:38:15.251 --> 00:38:20.230
not just to the person who,
you know,
you,
you wrote for the Stanford Review with,

622
00:38:20.231 --> 00:38:24.130
but you know,
other people.
How did,
how has that all going to work out and,

623
00:38:24.131 --> 00:38:27.010
and it's kind of incumbent on us to,
to figure that out.

624
00:38:27.160 --> 00:38:31.930
<v 1>Yeah.
Thank you.
Great perspective.
Um,
so the titles,</v>

625
00:38:32.090 --> 00:38:36.260
troublemakers,
why that title?
What's the,
um,

626
00:38:36.340 --> 00:38:38.800
what's the common,
um,

627
00:38:39.010 --> 00:38:42.610
attribute perhaps that all of these seven people have in terms of the trouble

628
00:38:42.611 --> 00:38:45.600
that they're creating at this formative time?
Yeah,

629
00:38:46.020 --> 00:38:49.680
<v 2>titles are incredibly hard to come up with,
I have to say.
Um,
we had this one,</v>

630
00:38:49.710 --> 00:38:52.500
then we went to some other ones that never quite sat right,

631
00:38:52.501 --> 00:38:57.000
came back to this one.
So the source of it is,
um,

632
00:38:57.420 --> 00:38:58.710
actually it's,
it's another,

633
00:38:58.711 --> 00:39:03.711
I guess Steve Jobs story when he comes back to apple in 1996 and then they bring

634
00:39:04.111 --> 00:39:04.944
out the,

635
00:39:05.660 --> 00:39:06.010
<v 3>yeah,</v>

636
00:39:06.010 --> 00:39:10.420
<v 2>add the next year that,
um,
it's,
you know,
here's to the crazy ones,</v>

637
00:39:10.421 --> 00:39:14.440
the troublemakers,
the square pegs in round holes or however it goes.

638
00:39:14.441 --> 00:39:16.430
It's in the front of the book.
Um,

639
00:39:16.480 --> 00:39:21.100
and that really captured to me the essence of what these people were doing,

640
00:39:21.101 --> 00:39:21.934
which is,

641
00:39:23.010 --> 00:39:23.820
<v 3>okay,</v>

642
00:39:23.820 --> 00:39:26.430
<v 2>one title we considered was disruptors,
which is,</v>

643
00:39:26.760 --> 00:39:30.240
I'm really glad we didn't go with,
um,
but there wasn't there,

644
00:39:30.570 --> 00:39:35.570
there was the notion at this time that to do what you needed to do,

645
00:39:36.920 --> 00:39:41.000
you couldn't do it inside the existing boundaries.

646
00:39:41.001 --> 00:39:44.030
That kind of constrains you,
but there wasn't the notion of,

647
00:39:44.240 --> 00:39:48.480
I'm just going to blow this up for no reason.
Um,
it was much more sort of,

648
00:39:48.490 --> 00:39:52.610
I want to accomplish this thing.
Um,
and here's how I'm,
I,

649
00:39:53.120 --> 00:39:56.090
I have to do it,
you know,
like,
um,

650
00:39:56.930 --> 00:39:57.240
<v 3>yeah,</v>

651
00:39:57.240 --> 00:40:01.560
<v 2>that's so Sandy,
Kurt Sig,
you know,
she couldn't get money from anyone.</v>

652
00:40:01.561 --> 00:40:05.730
She had to get it from her dad.
She was,
it wasn't,
it wasn't some sort of a,

653
00:40:06.030 --> 00:40:09.960
I'm going to stick it to the banks kind of idea,
you know,
um,

654
00:40:10.560 --> 00:40:14.930
or,
uh,
like the whole notion of dressing casually.

655
00:40:14.931 --> 00:40:17.810
Why is it that none of us is in a suit right now?
Well,

656
00:40:17.811 --> 00:40:22.080
that wasn't some sort of stick it to the man.
You know,
I,
I,

657
00:40:22.170 --> 00:40:25.900
I don't want to be constrained by sort of the,

658
00:40:26.180 --> 00:40:30.440
the ideals of,
of a broader society.
It was that all of these people were,

659
00:40:30.470 --> 00:40:32.480
most of them are coming straight out of college.

660
00:40:32.570 --> 00:40:36.470
A lot of them were starting companies straight out of college and they just

661
00:40:36.471 --> 00:40:38.660
started out in jeans and kept going.

662
00:40:38.930 --> 00:40:43.400
Or they were these computer scientists who couldn't get time on computers except

663
00:40:43.401 --> 00:40:47.540
late at night.
And so that's a big part of where the,
uh,

664
00:40:48.080 --> 00:40:52.900
uh,
casual work hours came from too,
was that it was just,

665
00:40:52.901 --> 00:40:57.901
it just sort of naturally flowed out of the academic world that surrounded

666
00:40:58.630 --> 00:41:01.600
people and the kind of Loosey Goosey counterculture feature.

667
00:41:02.140 --> 00:41:05.920
And in terms of what these three these people had in common,

668
00:41:07.260 --> 00:41:08.093
um,

669
00:41:08.580 --> 00:41:08.910
<v 3>okay.</v>

670
00:41:08.910 --> 00:41:09.743
<v 2>I would say,</v>

671
00:41:12.620 --> 00:41:13.453
<v 3>okay.</v>

672
00:41:13.640 --> 00:41:16.400
<v 2>They had an unusual set of characteristics in common.</v>

673
00:41:16.790 --> 00:41:20.840
One was they were simultaneously,
they were audacious and they were persistent.

674
00:41:21.260 --> 00:41:24.020
And sometimes those two don't go together.

675
00:41:24.021 --> 00:41:27.650
You'll have the people who have sort of the big out there idea.

676
00:41:28.340 --> 00:41:29.810
But um,

677
00:41:29.900 --> 00:41:33.470
and Bob Noyce was one of these people big out there idea and then he to go on

678
00:41:33.471 --> 00:41:37.280
and find the next big out there idea and Gordon Moore's behind him.
Like,
okay,

679
00:41:37.281 --> 00:41:39.350
well that's a good one.
That's a bad idea.
You know,

680
00:41:39.860 --> 00:41:44.860
these people tended almost to a person to be able to have the big idea and to

681
00:41:45.231 --> 00:41:48.620
follow through on the big idea or to find people who could follow through.

682
00:41:48.621 --> 00:41:50.330
So that audacity and persistence.

683
00:41:50.331 --> 00:41:54.380
And I think the third feature that I would point to is an appreciation of,

684
00:41:54.440 --> 00:41:56.210
of the team.
Um,

685
00:41:56.450 --> 00:42:01.450
none of these people set out to be or saw themselves as an independent rock star

686
00:42:02.721 --> 00:42:04.670
kind of doing this,
um,

687
00:42:05.000 --> 00:42:08.900
for the adoring acolytes who are their employees.

688
00:42:08.930 --> 00:42:12.740
I mean this was very much of a sense that,
um,

689
00:42:12.800 --> 00:42:14.350
we're all in this together and I,

690
00:42:14.351 --> 00:42:19.351
I think those three cover a lot because they're a ancillary characteristics that

691
00:42:19.950 --> 00:42:21.780
I'm the kind of fallout,
right.

692
00:42:21.820 --> 00:42:25.310
<v 1>Lamar are pretty significant.
Yeah.
Um,</v>

693
00:42:25.970 --> 00:42:30.860
so you talked about passing the baton and other industries sort of benefiting

694
00:42:30.861 --> 00:42:34.910
from each other and the semiconductor industry sort of in the backdrop plays a

695
00:42:34.911 --> 00:42:38.090
very big part and a lot of these companies,
a lot of the talent,

696
00:42:38.360 --> 00:42:43.220
Mike Markkula one example then going to apple,
but other examples like that.

697
00:42:43.250 --> 00:42:45.860
What was it about the experience,

698
00:42:45.861 --> 00:42:50.861
that early experience in semiconductor industry that set these individuals up to

699
00:42:52.580 --> 00:42:55.490
become such great technologists and,

700
00:42:56.000 --> 00:42:58.820
and executives in these,
in these other industries?

701
00:42:59.180 --> 00:43:03.770
<v 2>Yeah.
So I mean I think that what the chip industry gave people was,
um,</v>

702
00:43:04.130 --> 00:43:09.130
a sort of understanding of at that time how this worked for a very complicated

703
00:43:11.091 --> 00:43:12.740
idea to become a business.

704
00:43:13.130 --> 00:43:18.130
I think also the infrastructure that was built up to support chip entrepreneurs

705
00:43:19.041 --> 00:43:23.450
turned out to be the exact same infrastructure that these consumer electronics

706
00:43:23.451 --> 00:43:28.220
companies plugged into that then biotech plugged into that still,
I mean,

707
00:43:28.221 --> 00:43:31.750
think of how important sequoia is to this day.
I mean,

708
00:43:31.790 --> 00:43:35.480
people are still plugging into these same networks that were set up.

709
00:43:35.750 --> 00:43:39.680
I think that's something that the semiconductor industry,
um,

710
00:43:40.250 --> 00:43:45.110
couldn't help with was figuring out how to sell to consumers.
So on Nina,

711
00:43:45.111 --> 00:43:47.000
as you know,
apple,

712
00:43:47.180 --> 00:43:51.350
apple almost died right in the period that that jobs was gone.

713
00:43:51.380 --> 00:43:53.390
And I think that they didn't,

714
00:43:54.440 --> 00:43:59.330
they didn't have anyone there who really knew how to sell to consumers.

715
00:43:59.330 --> 00:43:59.631
And I mean,

716
00:43:59.631 --> 00:44:03.140
one of the things that's really interesting to me is they bring in John Sculley

717
00:44:03.560 --> 00:44:07.610
and everyone laughs,
oh my God,
this Pepsi Co Guy,
you know,
he,
what's,

718
00:44:07.670 --> 00:44:08.503
what's he doing?

719
00:44:08.600 --> 00:44:11.800
But what they were trying to do is figure out how the heck do you sell to,

720
00:44:11.930 --> 00:44:15.080
how do you sell to a consumer.
I mean,
this is something,

721
00:44:15.350 --> 00:44:20.350
so the chip industry was vitally important on one level and on some level this

722
00:44:22.101 --> 00:44:25.940
generation had to get beyond the one that came before.
And that's just,

723
00:44:26.030 --> 00:44:27.530
that's just the way it works.

724
00:44:27.531 --> 00:44:32.531
I mean that's the example I always use is of a grain of sand in a pearl.

725
00:44:33.150 --> 00:44:34.050
And how,
you know,

726
00:44:34.051 --> 00:44:39.051
you can have those sort of chips at the center of this little grain there,

727
00:44:39.690 --> 00:44:43.500
but then you build these layers around it and around it.

728
00:44:43.501 --> 00:44:47.250
And that again,
those generations that I'm talking about.

729
00:44:47.251 --> 00:44:50.550
So now we're out here and it's very easy to,
you know,

730
00:44:50.551 --> 00:44:55.210
we're out where we are in this part.
This is a very big pearl.
Um,
and we're,

731
00:44:55.620 --> 00:44:59.130
it's hard to imagine that.
Yeah.
Back Down at the core,

732
00:44:59.131 --> 00:45:02.580
we're still dealing with those chips cause so much have been added to it.

733
00:45:02.790 --> 00:45:06.000
So you do,
you have,
you lean on it,
but you've got to move beyond it.
Yeah.

734
00:45:06.230 --> 00:45:09.530
<v 1>That's great.
How,
um,
so love to ask you,</v>

735
00:45:09.590 --> 00:45:12.950
there's so many different great personalities profile in the book.

736
00:45:13.520 --> 00:45:17.330
If you had the opportunity to work with one of them and their prime,

737
00:45:18.140 --> 00:45:18.973
who would it be?

738
00:45:23.240 --> 00:45:25.000
<v 2>Oh,
okay.
Um,</v>

739
00:45:25.600 --> 00:45:30.040
if I had the opportunity to work with as a peer,
one of them,

740
00:45:30.100 --> 00:45:35.100
it would be fawn Alvarez because she is a firecracker and hilarious and I

741
00:45:38.141 --> 00:45:39.190
really,
really liked her.

742
00:45:40.480 --> 00:45:41.313
<v 3>Uh,</v>

743
00:45:42.030 --> 00:45:47.030
<v 2>I would have loved to work for Bob Taylor if he liked me.</v>

744
00:45:48.810 --> 00:45:50.970
I would not have wanted him to work for me.

745
00:45:50.971 --> 00:45:55.560
He was a very difficult man to have work for you.
Um,
and um,

746
00:45:56.280 --> 00:46:00.650
but he created an environment and everyone who worked for him who loved him

747
00:46:00.660 --> 00:46:05.660
talks about this sort of protected world that he created for innovation and

748
00:46:06.031 --> 00:46:08.400
creativity and execution.

749
00:46:08.430 --> 00:46:11.670
That I think just would have been magnificent to be a part of.

750
00:46:12.050 --> 00:46:15.980
<v 1>Sounds like if he didn't like you,
it wasn't quite as you were pleasant.</v>

751
00:46:16.040 --> 00:46:20.650
They were gone.
You were gone.
Yeah.
Oh,
interesting.
And so,
um,

752
00:46:20.960 --> 00:46:23.980
we'll open up for questions just a minute.
Um,
my,
uh,

753
00:46:24.050 --> 00:46:28.100
my last question will be sort of turning to some of the high tech companies

754
00:46:28.160 --> 00:46:31.010
today.
Um,
lots of the,

755
00:46:31.030 --> 00:46:35.470
the world's most valuable companies these days are in high tech.
Um,
and so I'm,

756
00:46:35.471 --> 00:46:40.190
I'm curious what companies like Google,
Amazon,
Facebook,
name,

757
00:46:40.191 --> 00:46:44.300
your favorites,
um,
have learned from these predecessors.
What are the,

758
00:46:44.301 --> 00:46:47.720
what's the foundation that they're standing on that you think should be

759
00:46:47.721 --> 00:46:52.520
recognized or,
or maybe hasn't been recognized as much and should be,
uh,
as,

760
00:46:52.580 --> 00:46:53.413
as we all grow up?

761
00:46:53.910 --> 00:46:58.760
<v 2>Well,
I mean,
something that I think,
um,
has been really interesting,
um,</v>

762
00:46:59.190 --> 00:47:03.420
that seems to still be embedded in the DNA in a lot of these companies.

763
00:47:03.870 --> 00:47:08.870
Is the founder continuing on whether he or she or it's usually they,

764
00:47:10.560 --> 00:47:15.030
the lone founder concept is,
it's just a myth.
Um,

765
00:47:15.180 --> 00:47:19.380
almost all great companies are founded by at least two people and sometimes
more.

766
00:47:19.860 --> 00:47:22.020
Um,
the,

767
00:47:22.170 --> 00:47:25.320
but none the less that the founders have stuck around,

768
00:47:25.321 --> 00:47:29.380
even when the sort of soup adult supervision comes in.

769
00:47:29.381 --> 00:47:34.120
I think that has been a lesson that has been learned from watching these,

770
00:47:34.240 --> 00:47:37.270
these companies where founders haven't stuck around.

771
00:47:38.200 --> 00:47:41.250
And it's problematic I think to

772
00:47:43.090 --> 00:47:46.660
all of the things that people associate with silicon valley perks now.

773
00:47:46.690 --> 00:47:51.690
Like a broad distribution of stock options is a great example.

774
00:47:52.450 --> 00:47:57.370
Um,
even a lot of,
uh,
things like free lunch,

775
00:47:57.460 --> 00:48:00.460
um,
sports being,
you know,

776
00:48:00.520 --> 00:48:03.550
sporting equipment and stuff happening on campus.

777
00:48:04.330 --> 00:48:09.130
A lot of that cultural stuff came directly from this time period that I'm

778
00:48:09.131 --> 00:48:12.250
talking about.
This company Rome where fallen Alvarez worked,

779
00:48:12.251 --> 00:48:15.760
which is now a parking lot at the 40 niners stadium.
Um,

780
00:48:16.180 --> 00:48:18.410
that company was incredible.
I mean,
they,

781
00:48:18.411 --> 00:48:22.300
they had jogging paths and uh,
they,

782
00:48:22.720 --> 00:48:25.090
they had a three month sabbatical,

783
00:48:25.120 --> 00:48:28.780
three month paid sabbatical after seven years of work.
And I mean,

784
00:48:28.781 --> 00:48:33.340
all of these sorts of benefits that I'm talking about speak to what I think

785
00:48:33.341 --> 00:48:36.630
companies have really learned in the valley,
which is that the,

786
00:48:36.740 --> 00:48:40.750
the people are the,
the easy,

787
00:48:40.810 --> 00:48:44.950
most easily lost and the most valuable part of a company.
Um,

788
00:48:45.070 --> 00:48:46.780
and that I think,
again,

789
00:48:46.781 --> 00:48:51.070
it's something that's been embedded in the DNA for a long time at this point.

790
00:48:51.190 --> 00:48:53.800
Yeah,
that's a great,
great point.
All right,

791
00:48:53.950 --> 00:48:58.630
<v 4>up to your questions.
We have a mic on the side.
Please don't be bashful.
Hi.</v>

792
00:48:58.650 --> 00:49:01.720
I really enjoyed reading the book.
The title is perfect.
Thank you.

793
00:49:02.030 --> 00:49:06.330
And I have a question related to the last one about a common thread through many

794
00:49:06.340 --> 00:49:07.173
of the stories,

795
00:49:07.900 --> 00:49:12.760
it seems to be that one story that repeated over and over is a large

796
00:49:12.761 --> 00:49:17.761
organization or a group of people either failing to see the value in some new

797
00:49:18.070 --> 00:49:21.230
opportunity or being unwilling to recognize you're going to be in staff.

798
00:49:21.240 --> 00:49:24.220
This case,
you know,
Warner with Atari,

799
00:49:24.370 --> 00:49:28.630
Stanford with these patents,
uh,
HP,

800
00:49:28.631 --> 00:49:30.160
like you mentioned before with apple,

801
00:49:30.161 --> 00:49:32.200
this pattern seems to repeat over and over again.

802
00:49:32.460 --> 00:49:34.510
The stories increase the opportunity for as a trouble maker.

803
00:49:35.170 --> 00:49:38.380
So in the context of today,
if you have a new set of large,

804
00:49:38.381 --> 00:49:41.140
powerful organizations,
they're clearly done something.

805
00:49:41.800 --> 00:49:46.800
I'm curious whether they've managed to sort of subsume the trouble makers.

806
00:49:46.901 --> 00:49:50.890
Is there something structurally different now or is it inevitable that today's

807
00:49:50.891 --> 00:49:52.990
powerful organizations and institutions?

808
00:49:53.440 --> 00:49:56.530
We'll miss the next big valuable opportunity,

809
00:49:56.770 --> 00:49:58.720
just like you've described in your book.
Okay.

810
00:49:59.670 --> 00:50:03.270
<v 2>So,
um,
we'll let,</v>

811
00:50:03.480 --> 00:50:08.340
we'll today's big companies be able to avoid the fate of,
um,

812
00:50:08.670 --> 00:50:09.510
you know,
the classic,

813
00:50:09.511 --> 00:50:13.530
it's the innovator's dilemma is clay Christianson puts it right.
Um,

814
00:50:14.310 --> 00:50:19.310
so a lot of people would say that the big companies today are trying to avoid

815
00:50:19.351 --> 00:50:22.670
this by acquiring all the small companies,
um,

816
00:50:22.830 --> 00:50:27.830
which there's some real debate as to whether that's a to silicon valley's

817
00:50:28.581 --> 00:50:33.410
future.
I,
if all of the small companies get eaten up by the big ones,

818
00:50:33.470 --> 00:50:37.610
um,
well,
it's a legitimate question to ask actually.
Uh,

819
00:50:38.240 --> 00:50:40.160
but there's,
there's no,

820
00:50:40.220 --> 00:50:45.220
there isn't no way that great companies aren't coming out of these big companies

821
00:50:46.940 --> 00:50:50.150
and,
and won't continue to do.
So.
I mean,

822
00:50:50.151 --> 00:50:52.980
I think that the other thing that software,
the,

823
00:50:53.050 --> 00:50:57.890
that's so much of this innovation happening in software has done because it's

824
00:50:57.891 --> 00:51:02.891
decreased the capital requirements so much and because it's made it possible for

825
00:51:03.831 --> 00:51:08.690
people to work in lots of places that are not all silicon valley.

826
00:51:09.050 --> 00:51:10.690
Um,
is the,

827
00:51:10.691 --> 00:51:15.691
the question of where else are these ideas going to be coming from?

828
00:51:16.550 --> 00:51:18.200
Because you,
you know,

829
00:51:19.940 --> 00:51:24.940
so many of these companies that come out of bigger companies come because there

830
00:51:26.031 --> 00:51:30.320
are a couple of usually engineers who can't get something done at their big

831
00:51:30.321 --> 00:51:32.570
company and they decide to go off and do it themselves.

832
00:51:32.960 --> 00:51:35.780
And those people are finding each other in other ways now,

833
00:51:36.080 --> 00:51:38.300
which I think is interesting.
Uh,

834
00:51:38.550 --> 00:51:43.550
I don't think that Silicon Valley has obsoleted itself by making location

835
00:51:43.580 --> 00:51:44.540
unimportant.

836
00:51:44.810 --> 00:51:49.430
Like I think that the serendipity factor of just sort of being able to walk down

837
00:51:49.431 --> 00:51:51.170
the street or,

838
00:51:51.230 --> 00:51:55.930
I mean we met in our daughter's kindergarten class is a million years ago.
Um,

839
00:51:55.980 --> 00:52:00.490
there's,
there's no,
there's no replacing that.
Like I don't worry,
uh,

840
00:52:00.590 --> 00:52:04.040
for Silicon Valley's future or the future of innovation at all.

841
00:52:04.340 --> 00:52:08.930
I just think that the way that I described there being multiple streams that can

842
00:52:08.931 --> 00:52:09.381
feed it,

843
00:52:09.381 --> 00:52:14.000
I think those streams now have their origin points to the way you know,

844
00:52:14.001 --> 00:52:15.950
in various places all over the world.

845
00:52:16.550 --> 00:52:17.383
<v 5>Thank you very much.
Yeah.</v>

846
00:52:21.280 --> 00:52:23.850
<v 4>Yeah,
man,
it's been a related,
uh,
thinking,
uh,</v>

847
00:52:24.880 --> 00:52:29.200
the like small companies being consumed by larger ones.

848
00:52:29.460 --> 00:52:30.160
Um,

849
00:52:30.160 --> 00:52:35.160
I don Norman came and talked to at Google about a year ago and afterwards,

850
00:52:35.230 --> 00:52:37.560
like there was a great discussion around,
um,

851
00:52:37.600 --> 00:52:41.140
so you talked about places like Xerox Parc and these wonderful innovation

852
00:52:41.141 --> 00:52:45.220
centers and even before that or around that time about labs and kind of Bemoan

853
00:52:45.221 --> 00:52:48.790
the fact that you didn't know if that was the case.
Nowadays,

854
00:52:48.791 --> 00:52:52.240
if you have spaces like that,
um,
maybe you do have spaces like that.

855
00:52:52.241 --> 00:52:55.180
A lot of the times they're under the umbrella of a larger company.

856
00:52:55.480 --> 00:52:59.830
And so thinking back to like passing the baton,
so there's been,
you know,

857
00:52:59.831 --> 00:53:04.330
baton passes from big company or like from a place like maybe apple,

858
00:53:04.360 --> 00:53:07.410
it's already a bigger company to another company.
Do you see,
like,

859
00:53:08.320 --> 00:53:11.710
I'm wondering if like Xerox Parc do you think has passed the time to another

860
00:53:11.711 --> 00:53:16.711
place that can provide this kind of exploratory environment,

861
00:53:16.950 --> 00:53:19.720
that type of innovation that's maybe,
um,

862
00:53:20.140 --> 00:53:24.250
well I guess it wasn't independent cause it was also attached to Xerox,
but yeah,

863
00:53:24.720 --> 00:53:26.130
<v 2>right.
Yeah.
Well,
I mean</v>

864
00:53:26.130 --> 00:53:27.480
<v 4>this is sort of,
you know,</v>

865
00:53:27.540 --> 00:53:31.830
Google sponsors a bunch of moon launchy project kinds of things.
Right?
I mean,

866
00:53:31.831 --> 00:53:36.831
I think that's something that we see people being interested in at the big

867
00:53:37.051 --> 00:53:42.000
companies.
I also,
I'm an,
I was on a panel with a,

868
00:53:42.001 --> 00:53:47.001
an early hacker and someone asked a question similar to this and um,

869
00:53:47.100 --> 00:53:50.310
so I'll just sort of pair it back what he said because I thought it was

870
00:53:50.311 --> 00:53:51.870
interesting,
not something I really know about.

871
00:53:52.110 --> 00:53:57.110
He was talking about all the maker spaces and the hacker spaces and the,

872
00:53:57.421 --> 00:53:58.020
uh,

873
00:53:58.020 --> 00:54:03.020
ability of people to do real innovation without needing the underlying

874
00:54:05.221 --> 00:54:09.840
infrastructure of a big company to sponsor the work.

875
00:54:10.200 --> 00:54:14.940
Now the question of,
you know,
what can that impact be?
Um,

876
00:54:15.000 --> 00:54:16.470
I don't know.
Yeah.

877
00:54:16.830 --> 00:54:20.240
One of the first articles I wrote for the New York Times was about,
um,

878
00:54:21.120 --> 00:54:23.550
a guy who had hacked Johnny Chung Lee,

879
00:54:23.551 --> 00:54:28.551
who had hacked a wee and then turned it into a very cheap whiteboard for

880
00:54:30.210 --> 00:54:34.890
schools.
And how the way he got that invention out there,
uh,

881
00:54:34.930 --> 00:54:39.930
was through youtube and how this had completely bypass the typical research

882
00:54:40.471 --> 00:54:43.480
structure of,
um,
you know,

883
00:54:43.610 --> 00:54:48.570
a person working alone in a,
or with a small team in an academic environment.

884
00:54:48.571 --> 00:54:52.530
And then waiting forever to get your paper accepted somewhere for publication

885
00:54:52.531 --> 00:54:56.250
and get it peer reviewed,
get it out.
There were like four people will read it.

886
00:54:56.251 --> 00:54:59.790
And you know that this has created a completely new way to disseminate

887
00:54:59.791 --> 00:55:03.390
information in the same way we've seen with Twitter and all of the other things

888
00:55:03.391 --> 00:55:07.660
that have created this,
um,
mass explosion of,

889
00:55:07.710 --> 00:55:09.960
of information.
Um,

890
00:55:10.050 --> 00:55:13.230
and then he went on to go to Microsoft researchers is interesting and I think

891
00:55:13.231 --> 00:55:14.340
he's moved on since then,

892
00:55:14.370 --> 00:55:18.630
but so I think there are opportunities out there for sure.

893
00:55:22.020 --> 00:55:26.540
I've heard a lot of people say that modern devices seems to be a lot less to

894
00:55:26.541 --> 00:55:30.690
gribble and accurate and basic yourself.

895
00:55:31.200 --> 00:55:34.090
Now it seems like the interaction,

896
00:55:36.440 --> 00:55:41.340
you certain apps and to find ways,
so for the future talent pipeline,

897
00:55:41.830 --> 00:55:42.510
uh,

898
00:55:42.510 --> 00:55:46.110
how do we keep raising this next generation of light tinkerers who were reverse

899
00:55:46.111 --> 00:55:48.060
engineering,
their electronics and so forth.

900
00:55:48.890 --> 00:55:50.690
<v 2>Yeah.
Uh,</v>

901
00:55:51.220 --> 00:55:55.100
and so I will say this has been a concern for a while.
Um,

902
00:55:55.140 --> 00:55:59.540
the people even coming straight out of the,
well,
I mean,

903
00:55:59.570 --> 00:56:02.520
honestly,
people were worried when,
uh,

904
00:56:02.600 --> 00:56:05.540
we moved away from cars.

905
00:56:05.600 --> 00:56:09.440
Like this is something that I really remember Bob Noyce had to talk to his

906
00:56:09.441 --> 00:56:12.460
family about because,
well,
how,
you know,
you,

907
00:56:12.461 --> 00:56:15.980
you can see how to take apart an engine,
but what about what these chips,

908
00:56:15.981 --> 00:56:20.360
you know,
you can't do that with chips.
You can't do that with electronics.
So the,

909
00:56:21.140 --> 00:56:25.780
the bar keeps getting,
um,
that said it's a legitimate question.

910
00:56:25.840 --> 00:56:30.840
And I think that I th I think that

911
00:56:33.560 --> 00:56:36.370
we're learning,
you know,
those,
those kids are learning,
uh,
uh,

912
00:56:37.610 --> 00:56:42.170
the same kind of creativity within a differently defined set of limits.

913
00:56:42.500 --> 00:56:47.360
And I don't,
I don't know the answer beyond,
I don't know the answer.

914
00:56:47.361 --> 00:56:52.361
How do you crack those limits open further to kind of return to the level of

915
00:56:53.481 --> 00:56:56.900
something more tangible?
Um,
but it's,
it's,

916
00:56:56.930 --> 00:57:01.930
it is an important question because having the playgrounds so tightly defined by

917
00:57:03.021 --> 00:57:06.870
other people is,
is troublesome,
you know?
Um,

918
00:57:08.790 --> 00:57:11.990
I don't know how it's gonna play out.
I,
I,

919
00:57:12.230 --> 00:57:17.230
I think that a lot of people see real hope for sort of a freer internet.

920
00:57:18.591 --> 00:57:22.880
I know you were talking on the device level,
but I mean on the broader level,
um,

921
00:57:23.810 --> 00:57:25.910
in the blockchain as a,
uh,

922
00:57:26.000 --> 00:57:29.090
as a sub place that has less control,
you know,

923
00:57:29.140 --> 00:57:33.310
less of different spaces.
I don't know if there's,

924
00:57:33.410 --> 00:57:36.050
we could come up with something analogous,
um,

925
00:57:36.080 --> 00:57:40.940
beyond sort of typical open source stuff,
uh,
on a smaller level,

926
00:57:41.190 --> 00:57:46.160
open source versus walled garden sort of debates.
Do you have any thoughts

927
00:57:48.520 --> 00:57:53.220
<v 4>blockchain because that was going to be over as the second question was going to</v>

928
00:57:53.221 --> 00:57:54.790
be your thoughts and cryptocurrencies.

929
00:57:54.950 --> 00:57:59.480
<v 2>Yeah,
I'm passing on my thoughts on cryptocurrencies.
I don't know enough.
Yeah,</v>

930
00:58:00.890 --> 00:58:01.723
<v 5>sure.</v>

931
00:58:04.790 --> 00:58:05.630
<v 4>Thank you very much.</v>

932
00:58:09.400 --> 00:58:14.400
And my question is just like a fault in CV,

933
00:58:15.500 --> 00:58:20.300
the Sim conductor evolution.
Uh,
do you see,

934
00:58:20.360 --> 00:58:21.193
uh,

935
00:58:21.790 --> 00:58:26.060
Bobby but the seeds from silicon valley been implanted in other areas throughout

936
00:58:26.061 --> 00:58:30.610
the world and we've got to be an interesting story for the book.

937
00:58:31.260 --> 00:58:33.600
<v 2>Yeah.
So absolutely.</v>

938
00:58:33.601 --> 00:58:38.601
I think that the circulation of people in and out of silicon valley from other

939
00:58:39.481 --> 00:58:43.650
parts of the world is,
is completely,
uh,

940
00:58:43.680 --> 00:58:48.680
bringing the model to other parts of the world and refining the model here in

941
00:58:49.081 --> 00:58:51.440
the valley.
Um,
there's an interesting book,

942
00:58:51.441 --> 00:58:55.980
it came out many years ago by a woman named Annalise Saxony and called the new

943
00:58:55.981 --> 00:59:00.750
argonauts that talks about exactly this,
the,

944
00:59:00.751 --> 00:59:02.670
the sort of people who come,

945
00:59:02.671 --> 00:59:07.530
the sort of communities that are made by different immigrant groups and then

946
00:59:07.770 --> 00:59:10.980
they go back.
Um,
and again,

947
00:59:10.981 --> 00:59:15.210
I would really point to if silicon valley,

948
00:59:15.240 --> 00:59:20.240
if the United States wants to hold on to its edge as an innovator,

949
00:59:21.170 --> 00:59:24.770
we need to be doing what we can to make sure that people have an incentive to

950
00:59:24.771 --> 00:59:27.110
stay here.
Uh,

951
00:59:27.470 --> 00:59:30.440
I think another vector before I forget,

952
00:59:30.560 --> 00:59:33.650
other than the entrepreneurs themselves is of course a lot of the venture

953
00:59:33.651 --> 00:59:36.680
companies have built,
uh,

954
00:59:37.160 --> 00:59:40.790
arms or offices around the world.
Um,

955
00:59:41.150 --> 00:59:45.380
the one approach that I think is probably not going to work very well is

956
00:59:45.381 --> 00:59:49.340
sometimes you see these top down government efforts in other parts of the world

957
00:59:49.341 --> 00:59:52.250
to sort of force a silicon valley.

958
00:59:52.251 --> 00:59:55.880
We're going to build a tech region and you know,
if you build it they will come.

959
00:59:56.870 --> 00:59:58.490
That doesn't really seem to work.

960
01:00:03.820 --> 01:00:07.190
<v 4>Hello.
These CIF devalued the stories.</v>

961
01:00:08.660 --> 01:00:09.650
So one thing is,

962
01:00:09.651 --> 01:00:13.400
is this cutting delivered up media companies like Facebook and Google

963
01:00:15.290 --> 01:00:19.520
seems to be this kind of,
so an sp more at the beginning of time get it.

964
01:00:19.530 --> 01:00:24.530
Cause you should not hear Dan Dan different that a strong independent journalism

965
01:00:26.360 --> 01:00:30.450
seems to be not so much shit busy.
So

966
01:00:32.090 --> 01:00:32.960
any comment on it

967
01:00:34.620 --> 01:00:37.350
and it seems to be a bit awkward

968
01:00:39.080 --> 01:00:41.450
stumbling through hot does that speed in this.

969
01:00:44.300 --> 01:00:46.160
<v 2>So,
uh,</v>

970
01:00:46.860 --> 01:00:47.080
<v 3>okay.</v>

971
01:00:47.080 --> 01:00:48.760
<v 2>I think I might</v>

972
01:00:49.690 --> 01:00:50.020
<v 3>okay.</v>

973
01:00:50.020 --> 01:00:53.140
<v 2>Take a little bit of issue with that premise.</v>

974
01:00:53.170 --> 01:00:58.170
I actually think there are a lot of entrepreneurs out there who are aspiring to

975
01:00:58.991 --> 01:01:03.440
build great,
great companies for the long haul.
Uh,

976
01:01:04.480 --> 01:01:06.090
I think that uh,

977
01:01:06.100 --> 01:01:11.100
those aspirations can evaporate when someone offers enormous sums of money.

978
01:01:14.770 --> 01:01:19.740
Um,
but I do think,
um,
the,

979
01:01:19.741 --> 01:01:19.951
you know,

980
01:01:19.951 --> 01:01:23.250
something that came through in this book again and again and again and again and

981
01:01:23.251 --> 01:01:27.660
again and again is how hard it is to start a company,

982
01:01:27.661 --> 01:01:30.000
how hard it is to get this off the ground.

983
01:01:30.030 --> 01:01:32.610
Even with all the support that you have,

984
01:01:33.090 --> 01:01:36.120
how many people are in your camp rooting for you.
You know,

985
01:01:36.121 --> 01:01:39.630
how however great your network is,
it's super hard.

986
01:01:39.660 --> 01:01:44.640
And I don't think anybody would ever make it through,
you know,

987
01:01:44.641 --> 01:01:49.641
the sixth consecutive day of 20 hours of work if they were like,

988
01:01:50.610 --> 01:01:53.910
some day someone else is going to run this all,
you know,

989
01:01:53.911 --> 01:01:58.440
it's just not something that people aspire to.

990
01:01:58.441 --> 01:01:59.790
I think as a group,

991
01:01:59.910 --> 01:02:04.910
I think you can get very tired and money can look very good and it becomes

992
01:02:05.251 --> 01:02:09.750
something you know,
you want.
But I think it's pretty,
it's pretty cynical.

993
01:02:09.751 --> 01:02:12.150
Let's put it that way,
to start like,
sort of like,

994
01:02:12.180 --> 01:02:15.390
my dream is to build an acquisition target.
You know,

995
01:02:18.660 --> 01:02:21.960
<v 4>um,
I really liked your analogy about the,
uh,</v>

996
01:02:21.990 --> 01:02:26.610
sort of like the seeds that spread like the pot of seeds.
Uh,
that's spreading.

997
01:02:26.620 --> 01:02:30.880
And grow the next generation of companies.
So like paypal,
Mafia,
uh,

998
01:02:31.540 --> 01:02:35.500
uh,
at Xerox Parc,
a Fairchild.

999
01:02:36.130 --> 01:02:37.670
Uh,
I was curious,

1000
01:02:37.820 --> 01:02:42.470
is there like a common strain and how these groups form,

1001
01:02:42.471 --> 01:02:46.730
do you think they're just incredible individuals to sort of find each other or

1002
01:02:46.731 --> 01:02:50.480
do you think there's like a way of working together,

1003
01:02:50.481 --> 01:02:55.310
like a worldview that that's learned once they sort of come together,

1004
01:02:55.540 --> 01:02:58.370
um,
under some great leader or something like that?

1005
01:02:58.650 --> 01:03:03.250
<v 2>Ah,
that's a superb question.
Um,
no,</v>

1006
01:03:03.251 --> 01:03:05.070
the three examples I cited,

1007
01:03:05.230 --> 01:03:09.810
Fairchild Park and paypal a what,

1008
01:03:11.500 --> 01:03:16.500
what they have in common is that those people in every case knew each other

1009
01:03:18.131 --> 01:03:20.130
before they got there.
Uh,

1010
01:03:20.440 --> 01:03:24.310
so if anyone's read the new book,
Bro Topia,

1011
01:03:24.311 --> 01:03:28.420
which I think is a very interesting and good book.
Uh,

1012
01:03:28.870 --> 01:03:33.870
one of the things that it really points to is who gets left out when,

1013
01:03:35.280 --> 01:03:40.210
uh,
your only bringing into your culture,
people who,

1014
01:03:40.211 --> 01:03:45.160
um,
you know,
from a previous experience and there's really,

1015
01:03:45.310 --> 01:03:48.160
they're smart reasons to do that.
Namely,

1016
01:03:48.580 --> 01:03:50.680
you guys are all thinking similarly.

1017
01:03:50.681 --> 01:03:54.580
Like you get to skip the acculturation step because,
oh,

1018
01:03:54.581 --> 01:03:58.330
we all worked together at Shockley semiconductor,
let's go start Fairchild.

1019
01:03:58.720 --> 01:04:02.280
Or we all got contracts from,
uh,

1020
01:04:02.590 --> 01:04:07.570
Arpa under this guy,
Bob Taylor,
and we,
and he likes the way we think,

1021
01:04:07.571 --> 01:04:11.410
we like the way he thinks.
So we're all going to just come together,
start park,

1022
01:04:11.411 --> 01:04:13.710
or we were all in Stanford together.
Um,

1023
01:04:13.750 --> 01:04:17.320
sort of on the conservative paper and such.
I now,

1024
01:04:17.590 --> 01:04:21.040
except for Reid Hoffman who was kind of like their,
their foil,
um,

1025
01:04:21.190 --> 01:04:24.300
now let's all go and start paypal together.
Um,

1026
01:04:24.430 --> 01:04:28.060
so I mean that is something that they've had in common.
Um,

1027
01:04:28.790 --> 01:04:32.770
Google's an interesting counter example to that,
right?

1028
01:04:32.800 --> 01:04:37.800
Because a Google for example in included women early on,

1029
01:04:38.590 --> 01:04:43.090
um,
very early on,
people like,
well,
Jackie and Marissa,

1030
01:04:43.091 --> 01:04:47.770
my error and um,
Sheryl Sandberg,
right?

1031
01:04:48.010 --> 01:04:53.010
So that's a story of a different potential model than the,

1032
01:04:54.010 --> 01:04:58.720
we're all in sync.
Um,
and it,
it appears to have worked

1033
01:05:02.490 --> 01:05:05.340
<v 4>along the lines of where you're talking about how these couples,</v>

1034
01:05:05.341 --> 01:05:08.760
they for each time conductor,
they grow,
then they pop.
Right.

1035
01:05:09.000 --> 01:05:10.440
And just thinking right now,

1036
01:05:10.680 --> 01:05:14.970
I mean did dawn that companies that are in the area like Google,
Facebook,
apple,

1037
01:05:15.410 --> 01:05:16.920
like you're just taking,

1038
01:05:17.170 --> 01:05:20.710
we're just taking so much real estate all over the place.
Like I remember here,

1039
01:05:20.711 --> 01:05:24.280
it used to be so concrete,
I picks up five seat parlor.
We have,
uh,

1040
01:05:24.400 --> 01:05:26.950
I was with a company,
rob as you previously.

1041
01:05:26.951 --> 01:05:31.180
Now Google's taken all those campuses because if you see any dangers or concerns

1042
01:05:31.181 --> 01:05:35.770
that if Google were to off load hopefully,

1043
01:05:35.930 --> 01:05:39.910
but all this real estate that it controls like all of the land and all the

1044
01:05:39.911 --> 01:05:41.560
different buildings happen.

1045
01:05:44.650 --> 01:05:46.450
<v 2>Wow.
So now we're getting into,</v>

1046
01:05:46.840 --> 01:05:50.440
the beautiful thing about being a historian is you never have to predict the

1047
01:05:50.441 --> 01:05:53.890
future.
Um,
I,

1048
01:05:54.280 --> 01:05:56.440
I don't know,

1049
01:05:56.441 --> 01:06:01.441
I can tell you that in a previous one thing silicon valley history teaches quite

1050
01:06:02.231 --> 01:06:07.231
well is that great things happen in economic declines.

1051
01:06:07.690 --> 01:06:10.000
So,
um,
you know,

1052
01:06:10.001 --> 01:06:13.720
you don't have to have any customers to buy your stuff when you're starting the

1053
01:06:13.721 --> 01:06:15.490
company.
You're trying to get it going.

1054
01:06:15.730 --> 01:06:18.460
So all of a sudden office space would be cheaper.

1055
01:06:18.700 --> 01:06:23.700
You would have people who are highly trained but are not employed.

1056
01:06:23.980 --> 01:06:24.311
You have,

1057
01:06:24.311 --> 01:06:29.311
I think that you might see another flowering of innovation.

1058
01:06:30.950 --> 01:06:35.140
Scarcity breeds clarity.
Exactly.
Yeah.
That's great.
Awesome.

1059
01:06:35.730 --> 01:06:36.481
<v 1>Well,
Leslie,</v>

1060
01:06:36.481 --> 01:06:41.481
thank you so much for sharing your incredible insight and providing perspective

1061
01:06:41.671 --> 01:06:45.240
on,
uh,
not only our industry,
but we're many of us live.

1062
01:06:45.241 --> 01:06:46.590
It's been fabulous to have you,

1063
01:06:46.591 --> 01:06:48.960
and we look forward to having you again at toxic goal.

1064
01:06:49.250 --> 01:06:50.750
<v 2>Thank you very much.
It's my pleasure.</v>
