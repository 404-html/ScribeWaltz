1
00:00:06.010 --> 00:00:08.530
Thanks everyone for joining us for this talks at Google event.

2
00:00:09.070 --> 00:00:11.950
We have two fantastic authors here for you today,

3
00:00:12.490 --> 00:00:15.540
Cory Doctorow and John Scalzi.
So we're a great school.

4
00:00:15.580 --> 00:00:20.580
<v 1>They're [inaudible]</v>

5
00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:26.290
<v 0>author of walkaway.
So Cory is a science fiction author,</v>

6
00:00:26.440 --> 00:00:28.900
activist,
journalist,
and blogger.

7
00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:34.560
He's the Co editor of boing boing boing boing.net and the author of the

8
00:00:34.751 --> 00:00:36.310
bestselling little brother,

9
00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:39.070
which is actually just recently optioned by paramount.

10
00:00:39.630 --> 00:00:44.140
So it's going to be a movie with Don Murphy producing pretty cool stuff.

11
00:00:44.560 --> 00:00:48.910
So he's also the former European director of the Electronic Frontier Foundation

12
00:00:49.690 --> 00:00:54.040
and he cofounded the UK Open Right's group.
He was born in Toronto,

13
00:00:54.041 --> 00:00:56.560
Canada and now lives in Burbank.

14
00:00:57.770 --> 00:01:01.640
That's the best for Toronto or for Bro.
That's retarded.
No,

15
00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:05.590
no Burbank glove.
Okay.
And then we have John Scalzi,

16
00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:07.960
author of the collapsing empire.

17
00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:13.660
He's one of the most popular and a claimed SF authors to emerge in the last

18
00:01:13.660 --> 00:01:14.493
decade.

19
00:01:15.190 --> 00:01:19.910
His massively successful debut old man's war SF has in science now that,

20
00:01:19.911 --> 00:01:24.130
not saying that not San Francisco is massively successful.

21
00:01:24.131 --> 00:01:28.120
Debut old man's war won him the science fictions.
John W.

22

Campbell Award for best new writer is New York Times bestsellers include the

23
00:01:32.621 --> 00:01:36.010
last colony,
fuzzy nation and red shirts,

24
00:01:36.011 --> 00:01:41.011
which one 2013 Hugo award for best novel and Lockin material from is widely read

25
00:01:43.091 --> 00:01:47.170
blog,
whatever has also earned him two other Hugo awards.

26
00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:49.360
He lives in Ohio with his wife and daughter.

27
00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:51.850
And let's put our hands together for them.

28
00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:56.890
<v 1>The welcome [inaudible].</v>

29
00:01:57.591 --> 00:01:57.920
Hello.
Hello

30
00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:01.870
<v 2>Cory.
Hello John.
It's nice to see you again now.
It's been so long since it has.</v>

31
00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:05.540
So John is at the very end of his tour and I'm at the very start of mine.

32
00:02:05.541 --> 00:02:10.450
John has come from my future to warn me about the terrible catastrophes and the

33
00:02:10.450 --> 00:02:12.950
coming weeks,
right?
It's hydrate and hand sanitizer.

34
00:02:12.951 --> 00:02:15.430
These are the two things that will get you through,
uh,

35
00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:17.480
most of these particular events,
right?
Well,

36
00:02:17.481 --> 00:02:20.270
hydration hydrational gets you through times of no hand sanitizer better than

37
00:02:20.271 --> 00:02:21.400
hand San Antonio and the handset.

38
00:02:21.401 --> 00:02:23.360
And how did we get you through challenges or no hydration?

39
00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:24.830
There's so much truth in that statement.

40
00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:26.630
I don't even know where to start anywhere.

41
00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:29.570
Realize it's all US halfway through it.
That it's actually true is actually true.

42
00:02:29.571 --> 00:02:30.261
You are trying to be,

43
00:02:30.261 --> 00:02:33.260
you're generally trying to be arching yet you're actually spoken a home truths

44
00:02:33.261 --> 00:02:35.970
that is truly useful to people who are on the electric hand sanitizer.

45
00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:40.160
Don't drink hand sanitizer.
I mean,
no matter,
no matter how fruity it smells,

46
00:02:40.161 --> 00:02:43.430
it's just,
it's going to end in pain.
Yeah,
that's right.
But you do,
I mean,

47
00:02:43.431 --> 00:02:47.150
you do see a lot of people and you shake a lot of hands in the very first time

48
00:02:47.151 --> 00:02:48.020
that I ever went on tour,

49
00:02:48.021 --> 00:02:51.110
I shook somebody's hand in San Diego and the next thing I knew I was in

50
00:02:51.111 --> 00:02:55.700
Minneapolis and Phoenix was somewhere in between that and it's just like,

51
00:02:55.760 --> 00:02:58.370
can't,
can't do that again.
I don't know what I did in Phoenix,

52
00:02:58.371 --> 00:03:02.800
but I can't ever back to that city now.
So,
so,
uh,

53
00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:06.460
so John,
uh,
you wrote this book,
the collapsing empire,

54
00:03:07.450 --> 00:03:11.350
a kind of eco catastrophe that you didn't realize it was an equal catastrophe

55
00:03:11.351 --> 00:03:14.920
until the review started coming in.
Well,
yeah.
What happened was this is the,

56
00:03:14.921 --> 00:03:17.560
this is the classic idea of the author,

57
00:03:17.561 --> 00:03:22.000
so fixated on their own specific idea that they don't really think about,

58
00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:26.740
uh,
necessarily about the obvious wider implications that are clear to everyone

59
00:03:26.741 --> 00:03:30.540
else.
In my specific case,
when I was writing the club scene empire,
um,

60
00:03:30.550 --> 00:03:34.690
I was thinking about,
uh,
the age of sail and the age of empires.
I,
you know,

61
00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:36.610
basically between,
uh,

62
00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:41.470
the 15th through the 18th centuries,
uh,
in Europe.

63
00:03:41.710 --> 00:03:44.230
And,
uh,
and what I was thinking about,

64
00:03:44.231 --> 00:03:48.400
what would happen to all those empires in Europe,
you know,
Portugal,

65
00:03:48.430 --> 00:03:50.450
the UK,
Spain,
um,

66
00:03:50.470 --> 00:03:55.470
if all of a sudden the jet stream and the ocean currents of just suddenly went

67
00:03:55.691 --> 00:03:59.620
away or shifted so significantly that all the things that they took for granted

68
00:03:59.621 --> 00:04:02.910
about how they were going to get around the world to get to the new,
uh,
you know,

69
00:04:02.940 --> 00:04:07.050
the new world order to get to Japan just suddenly disappeared.
Um,

70
00:04:07.150 --> 00:04:09.730
and this is relevant to me because I created,
because I,

71
00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:13.960
because I strongly believe that the speed of light is not only a good idea but

72
00:04:13.961 --> 00:04:17.440
actually the law and that you wouldn't want to go close to the speed of light

73
00:04:17.441 --> 00:04:21.710
anyway cause anytime you hit something spaces only mostly empty.
Right?
Um,

74
00:04:21.760 --> 00:04:23.620
so that when you hit something of course,
boom,

75
00:04:23.650 --> 00:04:27.790
that to all turns into energy and your doom.
Um,
so I created this,
uh,

76
00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:29.740
this thing called the flow,

77
00:04:29.890 --> 00:04:34.390
which is a sort of a extra dimensional conduit that gets you from one place to

78
00:04:34.391 --> 00:04:37.150
another because it doesn't have to obey the rules of this particular university

79
00:04:37.270 --> 00:04:38.950
because it sort of sits on top of it.

80
00:04:39.160 --> 00:04:41.650
It's basically a cheat but a very interesting cheat.

81
00:04:41.860 --> 00:04:46.720
But it works like ocean currents or it works like a,
the jet stream.
Um,

82
00:04:46.780 --> 00:04:51.520
and uh,
it's a feature of the universe that we have no control over.

83
00:04:51.670 --> 00:04:56.230
And so they built this entire empire using the flow.

84
00:04:56.231 --> 00:04:59.890
Just assuming that the flow is always going to be there because as far as they

85
00:04:59.891 --> 00:05:01.060
know,
it always has been,

86
00:05:01.330 --> 00:05:06.330
but the universe doesn't care what you think about permanence or what you need.

87
00:05:06.610 --> 00:05:09.370
It's basically just going to do what it's going to do and eventually the flow

88
00:05:09.371 --> 00:05:12.920
goes away.
So I'm busy thinking about these parallels too,
you know,

89
00:05:12.970 --> 00:05:16.660
ocean currents and the flow and people coming up to me,
uh,
at a,

90
00:05:16.661 --> 00:05:21.310
at these events and then go on.
It's about oil,
isn't it?
And I'm like,

91
00:05:22.570 --> 00:05:24.140
I guess it is,
you know,

92
00:05:24.760 --> 00:05:28.250
because it's the thing that happens where you have a,
you,

93
00:05:28.280 --> 00:05:32.500
you write something and you put it out in the world and it's no longer a just

94
00:05:32.501 --> 00:05:35.080
exclusive to your brain.
It is now in dialogue with what's,

95
00:05:35.110 --> 00:05:38.530
and the brain of somebody else.
Uh,
so the person who is looking at it going,

96
00:05:38.531 --> 00:05:42.430
this is obviously about oil or this is obviously about climate change or this is

97
00:05:42.431 --> 00:05:44.890
obviously about such and such.
Sometimes they,
you know,

98
00:05:44.891 --> 00:05:48.220
they can get really wacky about it,
but other times it's like,
Yup,

99
00:05:48.310 --> 00:05:50.950
cause I also live in,
I live in the now.
Right?

100
00:05:51.180 --> 00:05:55.420
And I do actually think about oil and climate change and even if I'm not

101
00:05:55.630 --> 00:05:58.550
thinking about them directly,
obviously they're going,

102
00:05:58.580 --> 00:06:01.010
that sort of stuff is going to seep into what I do.

103
00:06:01.100 --> 00:06:05.570
I also wonder if there isn't a parallel to be drawn though with a sort of theory

104
00:06:05.571 --> 00:06:06.800
free knowledge,
right?

105
00:06:06.801 --> 00:06:11.801
So one of the thing that brings all these people into catastrophe is that they

106
00:06:11.811 --> 00:06:14.390
don't really know how the flow works,
right?

107
00:06:14.391 --> 00:06:17.570
But it's worked so well for so long that they assume it will be stable.

108
00:06:17.900 --> 00:06:21.440
And we have a lot of things that we do that are kind of folk ways rather than

109
00:06:21.441 --> 00:06:22.330
reality.
You know,

110
00:06:22.380 --> 00:06:26.930
we'll ab split our way into some optimal pattern that we don't really know why

111
00:06:26.931 --> 00:06:27.381
it works.

112
00:06:27.381 --> 00:06:30.410
And so we used to bet it's stable for a long time and so we build up big

113
00:06:30.411 --> 00:06:32.450
edifices on it and then all of a sudden it,

114
00:06:32.540 --> 00:06:36.770
it changes or it turns out that it's fragile.
What happens is like,
uh,
an example,

115
00:06:36.830 --> 00:06:40.730
uh,
science fiction fandom.
There's this saying that Jay,
if you do something once,

116
00:06:40.731 --> 00:06:43.250
it's a tradition.
If you do it twice,
it's a hollow tradition.

117
00:06:43.430 --> 00:06:47.120
And what that means is that people get so used to doing things heuristically

118
00:06:47.121 --> 00:06:51.380
they don't even question whether that process makes sense outside of that

119
00:06:51.381 --> 00:06:55.310
specific thing.
Um,
and we do as humans we do things.

120
00:06:55.311 --> 00:06:57.830
So heuristically it's like,
why do you do this?
Because it's always worked.

121
00:06:57.831 --> 00:07:00.650
Why do you do it this way?
Well,
because then when I did it the other way,

122
00:07:00.651 --> 00:07:02.840
it didn't work the way I wanted to.
So I'm always going to do this.

123
00:07:02.841 --> 00:07:06.650
Can you explain why this works the way it does?
It just works the way it does.

124
00:07:06.651 --> 00:07:10.120
Stop asking me these questions.
I have things to do.
Um,
we do things.

125
00:07:10.121 --> 00:07:13.570
So heuristically,
um,
that what we ended up doing is we,

126
00:07:13.690 --> 00:07:18.290
we become trapped to a process without understanding how the process works.

127
00:07:18.290 --> 00:07:22.220
And that's of course how we fold down,
you know.

128
00:07:22.490 --> 00:07:25.980
Now let's segue a little bit into walkaway.
Sure.

129
00:07:26.060 --> 00:07:30.990
And we were talking about,
uh,
one of the things that you do in,
um,

130
00:07:31.630 --> 00:07:35.300
in walk away is that you actually pause it,
um,

131
00:07:35.510 --> 00:07:40.340
that a lot of people are actually going to cooperate in trying times,

132
00:07:40.640 --> 00:07:44.990
uh,
rather than go,
oh no,
it's every person for themselves and low and let's,

133
00:07:45.260 --> 00:07:47.210
you know,
get at it.
Now,

134
00:07:47.240 --> 00:07:52.170
there were some people who had say heuristically that when you go and,
uh,

135
00:07:52.270 --> 00:07:53.540
have a crisis,

136
00:07:53.640 --> 00:07:57.260
the thing that you should do is just sort of look out for yourself and assume

137
00:07:57.261 --> 00:08:00.850
that everybody else is going to take care of themselves.
Do you,
you don't have,

138
00:08:00.860 --> 00:08:01.580
so I mean,

139
00:08:01.580 --> 00:08:05.930
the theory that a 99.9% of people are total bastards.

140
00:08:05.960 --> 00:08:10.400
It has a,
has a really significant statistical,

141
00:08:10.401 --> 00:08:12.770
a problem with it,
which is that the people who have,

142
00:08:12.771 --> 00:08:15.390
it's this theory almost always also say,
but not you,

143
00:08:15.391 --> 00:08:16.820
me and all the people we know,
right?

144
00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:21.080
So the likelihood in a world where 99.9% of people are total bastards,

145
00:08:21.081 --> 00:08:24.440
that everyone that you know isn't,
is really low.
Right?

146
00:08:24.441 --> 00:08:26.840
It's much more likely that the people that you know,
our,

147
00:08:26.841 --> 00:08:31.841
our representative selection of the people around them and that they have the

148
00:08:31.941 --> 00:08:34.700
dual nature of all fragile and imperfect humans,

149
00:08:34.701 --> 00:08:39.701
which is to say that on a good day they a rise to the occasion and on a bad day

150
00:08:39.771 --> 00:08:43.440
they do things that haunt them forever as their regrets.
And what,

151
00:08:43.700 --> 00:08:48.700
what really matters in terms of a society is not how it works when it's working

152
00:08:49.311 --> 00:08:50.030
well.

153
00:08:50.030 --> 00:08:55.030
But what lessons it teaches us that come to mind easily when things go wrong.

154
00:08:55.591 --> 00:08:56.040
You know,
the

155
00:08:56.040 --> 00:09:01.040
<v 3>liquidation preference for a civilization that's based on a every person for</v>

156
00:09:01.561 --> 00:09:04.600
themselves.
My gain is your loss.
Uh,

157
00:09:04.620 --> 00:09:08.580
let's all be rational self interested actors and through that will emerge some,

158
00:09:08.730 --> 00:09:13.350
some kind of competitive but optimized world is that when things go wrong,

159
00:09:13.351 --> 00:09:16.950
you see your neighbors as your competitors and not as your potential saviors are

160
00:09:16.951 --> 00:09:21.951
people with whom you have some kind of mutual destiny or a mutual responsibility

161
00:09:22.021 --> 00:09:23.280
to,
and you know,

162
00:09:23.400 --> 00:09:27.540
all of the stories that we have through our history of civilizations falling in

163
00:09:27.541 --> 00:09:28.770
ways large and small,

164
00:09:28.771 --> 00:09:32.550
whether that's just the lights going up because the power plant collapsed her

165
00:09:32.551 --> 00:09:33.870
because we had a horrible quake or,

166
00:09:33.871 --> 00:09:37.440
or whatever or all the way up to the fall of the empire.

167
00:09:37.650 --> 00:09:40.800
Every one of those situations was not resolved by the people who ran to the

168
00:09:40.801 --> 00:09:43.770
hills.
Right.
By definition,
when you run to the hills,

169
00:09:43.771 --> 00:09:48.030
you do not solve those problems.
It's also by the people who run to the middle,

170
00:09:48.120 --> 00:09:52.140
right.
To see how they can help.
And you know,
coordinating that help is hard.

171
00:09:52.320 --> 00:09:53.880
And I always feel like there's,
um,

172
00:09:54.450 --> 00:09:59.450
a lot of drama latent in the story of people who agree with each other on what

173
00:09:59.821 --> 00:10:03.600
should be done,
but disagree about how it should be about how it should be done.

174
00:10:03.810 --> 00:10:06.960
And that it's actually a much more compelling drama in the,

175
00:10:06.961 --> 00:10:11.160
in the end than the easy drama of people who actually disagree about what should

176
00:10:11.161 --> 00:10:11.800
be done.
Right.

177
00:10:11.800 --> 00:10:15.900
The band versus man story is a lot less interesting than we're all on the same

178
00:10:15.901 --> 00:10:19.530
side,
but I hate you and I want to kill you.
A story which is something that,

179
00:10:19.531 --> 00:10:19.771
you know,

180
00:10:19.771 --> 00:10:22.410
as much harder to resolve as anyone who's ever gone to Christmas dinner with

181
00:10:22.411 --> 00:10:26.800
their family can tell you.
Right?
Uh,
and so walk away is a,

182
00:10:26.801 --> 00:10:30.570
a story about people who are consciously trying to,
uh,

183
00:10:30.600 --> 00:10:35.340
form societies that fail gracefully instead of societies that work well and that

184
00:10:35.341 --> 00:10:40.341
they're trying to use the coordinate of latent power of technology to get there.

185
00:10:40.860 --> 00:10:43.590
That rather than thinking about technology as the thing that helps us

186
00:10:43.591 --> 00:10:47.160
manufacturer communicate that they're thinking about it as a thing that lets us

187
00:10:47.190 --> 00:10:49.650
add our labor.
One to the other.
Um,

188
00:10:49.710 --> 00:10:52.080
even if we don't all agree on what's to be done,

189
00:10:52.290 --> 00:10:56.250
and if it turns out that I throw some code or some work into a project that

190
00:10:56.251 --> 00:10:59.100
turns out to be superfluous to it,
that's okay.
We can just,

191
00:10:59.101 --> 00:11:02.100
we can just leave it by the wayside or,
you know,
factor it out in,
in,

192
00:11:02.101 --> 00:11:04.360
in future revisions that,
um,

193
00:11:04.530 --> 00:11:07.140
rather than having someone sit down and tell us all what to do,

194
00:11:07.141 --> 00:11:08.880
we all do what we think needs to be done.

195
00:11:08.881 --> 00:11:11.850
And we have a tool that lets the parts of it that are useful,

196
00:11:11.851 --> 00:11:13.770
glom together so that,
you know,

197
00:11:13.771 --> 00:11:16.740
today we can build an encyclopedia the way that we used to,
you know,

198
00:11:16.741 --> 00:11:20.340
apply bureaucracy to the problem of building a bake sale.
Uh,

199
00:11:20.341 --> 00:11:24.120
and tomorrow maybe we could build skyscrapers and space programs that way,

200
00:11:24.121 --> 00:11:26.850
you know,
without the kind of coerce of hierarchical control.

201
00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:30.810
Maybe we can use additive labor to do it.
I see you shaking your head.

202
00:11:30.811 --> 00:11:35.530
Perhaps you should read the book,
but,
uh,

203
00:11:36.460 --> 00:11:39.450
but there are a lot of people who said they didn't want to Wikipedia

204
00:11:39.451 --> 00:11:41.700
encyclopedia for about 10 years.
Right.

205
00:11:41.701 --> 00:11:43.860
And there were a lot of people who said that they didn't want to go new

206
00:11:43.861 --> 00:11:47.910
operating system for about 10 years and they were really right for the first 10

207
00:11:47.911 --> 00:11:51.300
years.
Right.
That's the amazing thing.
Like it's,
you know,
as,
as,

208
00:11:51.301 --> 00:11:54.010
as you mean whale says it is a complete disaster in

209
00:11:54.010 --> 00:11:58.390
<v 4>theory,
it only works in practice.
Right?
Well here's,
but here's,
here's a question,</v>

210
00:11:58.470 --> 00:12:02.950
um,
that,
and one of the things that you can say is,
uh,
all right,

211
00:12:03.100 --> 00:12:07.270
so the idea that cooperation is kind of a,
one of thing,
not to be disputed,

212
00:12:07.720 --> 00:12:10.300
but how do you keep a wonderful thing,

213
00:12:10.301 --> 00:12:14.590
a wonderful communal thing from basically being swamped by the bastards?
Well,

214
00:12:14.591 --> 00:12:18.280
and that's a problem that the people in this story a really contend with,

215
00:12:18.520 --> 00:12:20.860
you know,
are,
we have,
um,
uh,

216
00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:25.960
a new move in the 21st century for resolving disputes,
which is forking,
uh,

217
00:12:25.961 --> 00:12:29.260
it's,
I mean,
it's not entirely new.
It's just lower costs than it's ever been.

218
00:12:29.440 --> 00:12:33.070
There's this thing in Canada where the further west you go,

219
00:12:33.100 --> 00:12:35.690
the weirder the Mennonites get because,
uh,

220
00:12:35.860 --> 00:12:40.300
men and autism is a schismatic faith because it,
it,

221
00:12:40.301 --> 00:12:43.600
it has this article that you shouldn't be worldly,

222
00:12:43.601 --> 00:12:46.750
but worldly is not a crisply defined a idea.

223
00:12:46.750 --> 00:12:50.100
And so what's one person's worldliness is someone else's nom worldliness.

224
00:12:50.270 --> 00:12:51.500
I have a friend who's grown,

225
00:12:51.570 --> 00:12:54.760
who grew up in a Mennonite community that was founded by people who disagreed

226
00:12:54.761 --> 00:12:57.560
about whether or not vertical blinds were cool,
right?
They,

227
00:12:57.561 --> 00:13:00.430
they thought they were the people who are old order thought they shouldn't be.

228
00:13:00.431 --> 00:13:01.930
And so they moved west,
right?

229
00:13:02.050 --> 00:13:04.870
So you get all the way west to Saskatchewan and there's that wonderful science

230
00:13:04.871 --> 00:13:06.650
fiction writer named Carl Schrader who's uh,

231
00:13:06.910 --> 00:13:11.650
a second multigenerational Mennonite.
His father was a Mennonite TV repairmen.

232
00:13:11.920 --> 00:13:16.600
Right?
And so this was like somehow reconcilable with this,
this,
uh,

233
00:13:16.601 --> 00:13:20.780
this faith,
right?
So that's a very expensive way of,
of,

234
00:13:20.860 --> 00:13:25.300
of skimming.
But we have a much cheaper way of skimming now,
which is that we can,

235
00:13:25.301 --> 00:13:29.620
but we can fork the code,
we can keep the code bases reconciled,
but we can,

236
00:13:29.621 --> 00:13:32.740
we can add stuff on it,
on top of it.
And so,
you know,

237
00:13:32.741 --> 00:13:36.220
the kind of Debbie into a boon to model of,
of,
um,

238
00:13:36.460 --> 00:13:38.000
of skimming is a,

239
00:13:38.170 --> 00:13:41.440
is a much more interesting one because it allows for a lot of experimentation at

240
00:13:41.441 --> 00:13:42.101
the margin,
right?

241
00:13:42.101 --> 00:13:45.430
You can do a lot of like parallel universe stuff where it's like,
well,

242
00:13:45.431 --> 00:13:50.200
what if we rerun Debbie again but we gave up on this principle or we included

243
00:13:50.201 --> 00:13:53.230
some non-free repositories and we did something else that wasn't,
you know,

244
00:13:53.231 --> 00:13:56.530
that was key core to Debbie.
And,
and then you get to find out like,
what's up,

245
00:13:56.560 --> 00:13:59.470
how's it work?
Instead of having a kind of abstract argument,

246
00:13:59.740 --> 00:14:01.570
you can actually try it and see what happens.

247
00:14:01.571 --> 00:14:05.020
So it's like a choose your own adventure.
It's or,
or,

248
00:14:05.021 --> 00:14:07.000
or like parallel multiple parallel universes.

249
00:14:07.001 --> 00:14:10.980
And so the walkaways for better and for worse.
You know the,
the,
the,

250
00:14:10.981 --> 00:14:15.190
the thing about walkway,
it's as this sort of burning man ish co subculture,

251
00:14:15.191 --> 00:14:17.680
but what it is,
is they walk away from the world.

252
00:14:17.680 --> 00:14:21.610
They find Brownfield sites that have been left behind by the collapse of

253
00:14:21.611 --> 00:14:22.900
industrial civilization.

254
00:14:23.080 --> 00:14:26.990
They harvest the waste stream that's exhausted off what's left of postindustrial

255
00:14:26.991 --> 00:14:29.710
industrial civilization and using cool tools.

256
00:14:29.711 --> 00:14:32.050
They build fully automated leisure communism.

257
00:14:32.290 --> 00:14:34.210
And if someone comes along and says,
you know,

258
00:14:34.211 --> 00:14:37.630
that patch of dirt is mine and that garbage that you're using doesn't belong to

259
00:14:37.631 --> 00:14:38.980
you.
Rather than argue about it,

260
00:14:38.981 --> 00:14:42.460
they just go somewhere else because they'd like all garbage and patches of

261
00:14:42.610 --> 00:14:47.110
blighted land are fungible.
And so they just go find somewhere else to,
to,
to,

262
00:14:47.150 --> 00:14:50.740
to try out their experiment.
And they're able to do this for better or for worse.

263
00:14:50.741 --> 00:14:52.100
And the worse is that they,

264
00:14:52.101 --> 00:14:56.480
that there are times when doing that actually does cost them something right and

265
00:14:56.481 --> 00:15:00.590
that they,
that they can't always reconcile it.
And then the people who,
uh,

266
00:15:00.620 --> 00:15:03.530
who have kicked them off plot of land a,

267
00:15:03.740 --> 00:15:06.980
sometimes aren't happy with them walking to plot of land be sometimes there

268
00:15:07.130 --> 00:15:10.850
mortally offended that they've walked off in an in particular when I'm the

269
00:15:10.851 --> 00:15:15.200
walkaways who are walking away or our scientists who've taken the practical cure

270
00:15:15.201 --> 00:15:18.200
for death,
uh,
out of the default world and,
and,

271
00:15:18.250 --> 00:15:22.460
and kind of stolen fire from the gods and brought it to everyone else done.

272
00:15:22.460 --> 00:15:25.780
I'll kind of,
Aaron Swartz,
cy hub,
kind of,
uh,

273
00:15:25.830 --> 00:15:30.200
exfiltration of the,
to have the technology necessary for mortality.

274
00:15:30.320 --> 00:15:33.860
The super rich realize that they're going to have to spend the rest of eternity

275
00:15:33.861 --> 00:15:37.970
with us and become really,
really upset about it.

276
00:15:37.971 --> 00:15:40.550
And walking away ceases to be a viable strategy.

277
00:15:40.551 --> 00:15:42.160
Now they have to start running away.
Yeah.

278
00:15:42.860 --> 00:15:47.740
<v 2>I love watching you talk
cause he,
the funny thing about Corey is,</v>

279
00:15:47.741 --> 00:15:48.860
is like he like Corey,

280
00:15:49.190 --> 00:15:54.190
here's the thought and he goes so formal and now this comes out like 10,000

281
00:15:55.191 --> 00:15:59.720
ideas in this,
in this,
uh,
uh,
stream like a,
you know,
you're,

282
00:15:59.721 --> 00:16:02.460
you're the fire hose of ideas.
Well that's kind of,
it's,
it's,

283
00:16:02.630 --> 00:16:04.220
but it's true though.
And it's like,
so when they,

284
00:16:04.230 --> 00:16:06.140
when we were first talking to them,
they were like,
oh,

285
00:16:06.210 --> 00:16:08.990
we want to pair you up with Corey.
I'm like,
yeah,
sign me up.
I am the,

286
00:16:09.140 --> 00:16:12.620
I am the carbon fuel or the carbon rod to his nuclear fuel,

287
00:16:12.770 --> 00:16:17.240
cause he's going to go all over the place and I'm going to be okay.
Here we go.

288
00:16:17.270 --> 00:16:20.640
I love this analogy.
I love that you're the nerd carbon road.

289
00:16:25.090 --> 00:16:28.150
Uh,
but,
uh,

290
00:16:29.870 --> 00:16:31.980
now actually,
here's the thing that,
uh,

291
00:16:32.120 --> 00:16:34.760
we had talked about in previous things and I'm gonna,
I'm gonna,
uh,

292
00:16:34.860 --> 00:16:37.760
approach it to you a little bit.
Uh,
one of the things that we,

293
00:16:37.761 --> 00:16:42.110
we were talking about is one of the,
uh,
the issues of,
um,

294
00:16:42.170 --> 00:16:46.280
way back when with primogeniture and how that related to colonialism.

295
00:16:46.430 --> 00:16:50.680
Primogeniture means the only one person,
usually it's on inherits.
Um,

296
00:16:50.700 --> 00:16:55.220
and then colonialism to accent solved that problem because,
uh,

297
00:16:55.290 --> 00:16:57.110
you could go from,
uh,
you know,

298
00:16:57.111 --> 00:17:00.830
you could take those second and third sons or whatever and have them find their

299
00:17:00.831 --> 00:17:03.750
own fortunes out in the world.
Um,

300
00:17:03.800 --> 00:17:07.940
and eventually it exhausts itself because there's only so much world out there.

301
00:17:08.140 --> 00:17:12.050
Um,
and that was,
uh,
leads to a kind of collapse that cost,
for example,

302
00:17:12.140 --> 00:17:16.720
World War One,
and then as a consequence of World War II.
Um,
but let me,

303
00:17:16.860 --> 00:17:19.700
let me apply that to the,
to the world of the walkways.
One of the,

304
00:17:19.730 --> 00:17:23.030
one of the posits here is that when you fork you can just go somewhere else

305
00:17:23.570 --> 00:17:28.100
sooner or later.
Don't you run up,
run out of somewhere else?
Yeah.
So,
so,

306
00:17:28.101 --> 00:17:32.210
uh,
in that regard,
um,
so,
so to,

307
00:17:32.211 --> 00:17:33.530
to kind of reiterate this,

308
00:17:33.531 --> 00:17:36.740
this earlier part Toma Piketty and capital in the 21st century,

309
00:17:36.741 --> 00:17:41.120
he hypothesizes that the age of colonialism created allowed every family to

310
00:17:41.121 --> 00:17:43.550
create as many dynastic fortunes as they had sons.

311
00:17:43.580 --> 00:17:47.990
And that eventually you run out of colonies that you can get dynastic fortunes

312
00:17:47.991 --> 00:17:50.040
out of.
But the fortunes had a,

313
00:17:50.070 --> 00:17:53.520
<v 3>had a character of rivalries snus right.
The fortune that I have as a fortune.</v>

314
00:17:53.521 --> 00:17:58.521
You can't have what the walkaways get is like a kind of federated universe of

315
00:17:59.251 --> 00:18:03.990
different,
slightly different variations on their ethics and on their,
on their,

316
00:18:04.020 --> 00:18:06.600
uh,
design aesthetics and on their practices,

317
00:18:06.601 --> 00:18:08.790
their engineering practices are there social practices.

318
00:18:09.030 --> 00:18:10.350
And so you're right that there may,

319
00:18:10.380 --> 00:18:14.310
there may be some element that is optimal for you that's not,

320
00:18:14.340 --> 00:18:17.250
that isn't perfectly suited in any of the places,

321
00:18:17.460 --> 00:18:21.660
but they're also not super intensely specified.
So,
you know,

322
00:18:21.661 --> 00:18:25.320
the like the likelihood that there's something that's really important to you

323
00:18:25.321 --> 00:18:28.680
that no one will tolerate and you can't find anywhere to do it,

324
00:18:28.681 --> 00:18:33.570
that's a pretty low likelihood,
right?
It's,
it's,
you know,
and this coordination,

325
00:18:33.571 --> 00:18:34.950
it's a really remarkable thing.
In fact,

326
00:18:34.951 --> 00:18:39.530
one of the impetuses for this book was a thing Google did.
Uh,

327
00:18:39.600 --> 00:18:40.680
they um,
uh,

328
00:18:40.681 --> 00:18:45.681
you guys built a data center in Belgium in a a valley where a two thirds of the

329
00:18:45.931 --> 00:18:47.520
time you don't need chillers.

330
00:18:47.521 --> 00:18:50.370
It's the ambient temperature is low enough that you don't need chillers.

331
00:18:50.580 --> 00:18:54.150
And the rest of the time they just shut off the servers because the file system

332
00:18:54.151 --> 00:18:57.600
is distributed and the you can coordinate the labor.
And this was a,

333
00:18:57.601 --> 00:19:01.590
a remarkable realization for me that we could,
um,

334
00:19:02.040 --> 00:19:07.040
we could use coordination to simply shunt around resources to wherever their let

335
00:19:08.920 --> 00:19:11.010
least environmentally catastrophic,

336
00:19:11.011 --> 00:19:14.190
wherever they are kind of most harmonious with the rest of the world.

337
00:19:14.191 --> 00:19:17.340
And then we could realize these new efficiencies that,
um,

338
00:19:17.820 --> 00:19:22.020
really challenged the notion that you can't have infinite growth in a finite

339
00:19:22.021 --> 00:19:23.060
world.
Uh,

340
00:19:23.310 --> 00:19:28.110
infinite growth implies that you don't have any kind of process automation and

341
00:19:28.111 --> 00:19:32.660
you don't have any changes in what people want.
Right.
Uh,
and that,
that,
you know,

342
00:19:32.700 --> 00:19:33.870
we'll just keep growing well,

343
00:19:33.871 --> 00:19:37.260
like keep making cars that have x tons of steel on them and we can do that

344
00:19:37.261 --> 00:19:39.030
infinitely.
That's obviously not true,

345
00:19:39.300 --> 00:19:42.900
but there doesn't seem to be any bottom insight to how few tons of steel you can

346
00:19:42.901 --> 00:19:46.380
put in a car.
And so in that regard,
we can get some,

347
00:19:46.381 --> 00:19:48.900
some extremely flexible growth out of there.

348
00:19:49.050 --> 00:19:52.470
And then when you add to that using coordination to move cars and people close

349
00:19:52.471 --> 00:19:55.650
to each other when they need them,
and then apart when they don't,
boy,

350
00:19:55.651 --> 00:19:57.420
you can sure get a lot of cars,

351
00:19:57.421 --> 00:20:02.340
people's miles seats without having to necessarily multiply the number of tons

352
00:20:02.341 --> 00:20:06.150
of steel by the number of people,
uh,
to get the number of cars,

353
00:20:06.151 --> 00:20:10.320
the effective use of the car as opposed to the sheer number of cars.
Right,
right.

354
00:20:10.321 --> 00:20:12.000
I mean,
that's,
you know,
it's,
it's a,

355
00:20:12.010 --> 00:20:17.010
it's better than then the mere despotic dominion over a car that after all,

356
00:20:17.131 --> 00:20:20.440
you then have to take care of and find a place to put and right.

357
00:20:20.490 --> 00:20:21.330
And all the rest of it.

358
00:20:21.331 --> 00:20:24.710
It's like [inaudible] and which is inevitably the third best car,

359
00:20:24.720 --> 00:20:28.320
the fifth best car as opposed to the very best car for your needs because you

360
00:20:28.321 --> 00:20:32.520
can't afford that.
Uh,
the,
the,
the interesting movies,
science fiction,

361
00:20:32.521 --> 00:20:36.150
one of the best moves of science fiction is to take a technological phenomenon

362
00:20:36.390 --> 00:20:40.740
and see if it can be extracted from it social and economic context and whether

363
00:20:40.741 --> 00:20:43.470
it still works.
This is a steam punk,
right?
Like,
what is,
what is,

364
00:20:43.650 --> 00:20:46.860
what does it mean if you could like have the machines without the factory,
right?

365
00:20:46.861 --> 00:20:49.660
Mad scientists could do productivity,
uh,

366
00:20:49.661 --> 00:20:52.120
that are characteristic of an assembly line,

367
00:20:52.240 --> 00:20:55.160
but they could do it all alone in their labs,
right?
Um,

368
00:20:56.050 --> 00:21:00.580
to imagine something like fleet vehicles without market capitalism,

369
00:21:00.880 --> 00:21:03.760
right.
Without,
without even communal ownership.
Mark,
uh,
you know,

370
00:21:03.761 --> 00:21:07.750
that we're just a kind of epic phenomenon of cooperative work without any

371
00:21:07.751 --> 00:21:09.700
formalized structures that that's how like,

372
00:21:09.701 --> 00:21:12.850
it's a really provocative thought experiment to imagine what kind of

373
00:21:12.851 --> 00:21:14.170
arrangements we'd get out of that.

374
00:21:14.230 --> 00:21:17.620
I wish I had a car and then then a car drives up and you go and do your car and

375
00:21:17.621 --> 00:21:19.900
then you say goodbye car.
Thank you for driving me.
Right?

376
00:21:19.901 --> 00:21:21.580
And if it turns out there are no cars,
then,

377
00:21:21.610 --> 00:21:25.330
then some other thing that you might want to do is brought to your attention

378
00:21:25.331 --> 00:21:27.010
that doesn't require a car.
You know,

379
00:21:27.011 --> 00:21:30.910
there's a whole a group of people and walk away that are,
um,
uh,

380
00:21:30.911 --> 00:21:35.680
the remnants of,
uh,
of,
uh,
investment bubble in Zeppelins.
Uh,

381
00:21:35.770 --> 00:21:38.110
and they,
they,
you know,
just like the,
you know,

382
00:21:38.170 --> 00:21:40.800
20 years ago we had this investment bubble that,
um,

383
00:21:41.140 --> 00:21:45.520
use pension funds to teach humanities majors how to write Java script,
uh,

384
00:21:45.550 --> 00:21:47.230
w w this,
this,
and this.

385
00:21:47.231 --> 00:21:51.960
This bubble turns a whole ton of disaffected post-millennials into air ship

386
00:21:51.961 --> 00:21:56.410
builders and pilots but doesn't actually produce so functional airship economy.

387
00:21:56.710 --> 00:22:00.740
And so,
um,
a bunch of them just start building air ships,
but they,
they,

388
00:22:00.741 --> 00:22:02.860
they are non propelled air ships.

389
00:22:02.861 --> 00:22:06.850
They have minimal impellers and so they just go where the winds are blowing.

390
00:22:06.970 --> 00:22:09.760
But because they're,
they were all part of this global phenomenon,

391
00:22:09.880 --> 00:22:12.760
they kind of know somewhere wherever the winds might blow them.

392
00:22:12.970 --> 00:22:16.320
And so it's a kind of movable party,
you sort of check to see who's on the,

393
00:22:16.470 --> 00:22:19.390
the next air ship through town and whether you know them and when you get on the

394
00:22:19.391 --> 00:22:19.720
airship,

395
00:22:19.720 --> 00:22:22.720
you checked to see whether the next town that the wind is blowing you too as a

396
00:22:22.721 --> 00:22:26.170
place where there might be someone you want to hang out with.
Right.
And the,
the,

397
00:22:26.260 --> 00:22:30.760
uh,
automation marries the two.
Right.
Fascinating.

398
00:22:32.500 --> 00:22:36.850
Now,
um,
do you think there are antecedents,
I mean,
not antecedents in,

399
00:22:36.880 --> 00:22:41.110
in your,
uh,
in,
in the human experience,
but antecedents,
uh,

400
00:22:41.111 --> 00:22:45.120
to what you're doing?
Uh,
in science fiction?
I mean,
one of the things that I,

401
00:22:45.180 --> 00:22:49.800
I kind of see walkway being is almost like the seed culture for,
uh,

402
00:22:49.810 --> 00:22:53.200
in banks culture series.
Yeah,
sure.
Yeah.
I think banks is,

403
00:22:53.440 --> 00:22:54.820
banks definitely was,

404
00:22:54.821 --> 00:22:58.420
was writing about what a post scarcity world would look like.

405
00:22:58.780 --> 00:23:03.760
But the,
if there's a difference in our angle,
he's,
he's got this fait accompli.

406
00:23:03.840 --> 00:23:06.670
Sure.
Right.
And I'm,
and I'm thinking about the transitional state,

407
00:23:06.671 --> 00:23:11.230
which is a really interesting moment to think about it.
And his,
his,
uh,

408
00:23:11.231 --> 00:23:15.420
emphasis is really on a manufacturer as opposed to coordination,
right?

409
00:23:15.430 --> 00:23:16.970
So it's his,
you know,

410
00:23:16.990 --> 00:23:21.030
his magical technology is the two dates.

411
00:23:21.031 --> 00:23:25.300
Still rather fanciful idea that,
you know,
matter can be conjured,
you know,

412
00:23:25.301 --> 00:23:28.270
organized matter can be conjured up,
out of code,
which,
you know,

413
00:23:28.271 --> 00:23:29.620
not withstanding a few,

414
00:23:29.650 --> 00:23:32.800
three d printers around the margin is not a thing that we do very reliably at

415
00:23:32.801 --> 00:23:35.630
mass scale,
uh,
yet.
Uh,

416
00:23:35.860 --> 00:23:39.510
but for me it doesn't really matter if you've got three d printers and walkway

417
00:23:39.520 --> 00:23:42.880
through it,
walk away,
works pretty good.
Even if all you've got is,
um,

418
00:23:42.910 --> 00:23:46.670
just people who are assembling stuff because they're still able to do process

419
00:23:46.671 --> 00:23:49.540
improvement,
they're still able to feedback to one another.

420
00:23:49.550 --> 00:23:54.020
They're still using software networks to take whatever it is they can make and

421
00:23:54.021 --> 00:23:58.970
make it better on demand continuously all around the world and saw it's it's

422
00:23:58.971 --> 00:24:03.570
hardware that acts like a software object.
Right.
So basically what,
uh,

423
00:24:04.790 --> 00:24:07.610
one of the things that we talked about earlier is like the triangle.

424
00:24:07.630 --> 00:24:11.970
You said of the,
you know,
what you have process.
I tell me,

425
00:24:11.971 --> 00:24:15.440
remind me of the triangle of,
of,
of a post scarcity.

426
00:24:15.650 --> 00:24:17.090
Up here you have what we want.

427
00:24:17.390 --> 00:24:21.590
So Keynes wrote this essay in 1930 about how his grandchildren would struggle to

428
00:24:21.591 --> 00:24:25.490
fill their lives after the 15 hour work week was introduced because there would

429
00:24:25.491 --> 00:24:26.430
be no reason to,

430
00:24:26.431 --> 00:24:30.080
to work beyond that because we could fill all our material wants.
And you know,

431
00:24:30.081 --> 00:24:34.160
the,
the resolution to Keynes is paradox today is that Keynes dramatically

432
00:24:34.161 --> 00:24:37.820
underestimated how much people would want,
but that peoples,

433
00:24:37.840 --> 00:24:42.840
that people's desires where elastic and we're sponsored IV to new material goods

434
00:24:43.100 --> 00:24:46.400
or a cynic might say that people are amenable to marketing messages and one

435
00:24:46.401 --> 00:24:47.420
things that they don't really want.

436
00:24:47.421 --> 00:24:50.120
They can be convinced in the moment that they want something that actually,

437
00:24:50.390 --> 00:24:53.860
and objectively they don't want.
But,
but whatever your explanation is,
right,

438
00:24:53.861 --> 00:24:58.470
that's up in this corner down here you have,
you have the production,
right?

439
00:24:58.580 --> 00:25:01.320
But over here you have what you have the uh,

440
00:25:01.340 --> 00:25:05.060
ability to coordinate what we want with what we can make,
right?
And you know,

441
00:25:05.061 --> 00:25:06.800
the thing that allows,
you know,

442
00:25:06.801 --> 00:25:11.060
the port of Guang Jo to fire a shipping container full of happy meal toys at the

443
00:25:11.061 --> 00:25:15.110
port of Los Angeles,
one a second,
365 days a year.

444
00:25:15.230 --> 00:25:19.820
Like our rail gun firing tchotchke goes,
you know,
is that's coordination right?

445
00:25:19.821 --> 00:25:24.230
At these long supply chains are all built up out of coordination technology.

446
00:25:24.231 --> 00:25:25.064
It's a,
it's a,

447
00:25:25.200 --> 00:25:29.430
a marvel to behold and it's such an everyday marvel that we don't even notice

448
00:25:29.450 --> 00:25:32.120
that when we think about three d printers as being miraculous,

449
00:25:32.270 --> 00:25:35.900
what's really miraculous as that Mcdonald's can sell you a cow with a beef of a

450
00:25:35.900 --> 00:25:38.470
thousand or a burger with a beef,
a thousand cows in it,
right?

451
00:25:38.510 --> 00:25:41.600
That like we can do these incredible complex,

452
00:25:41.750 --> 00:25:46.370
seemingly fragile supply chains that nevertheless are really robust against
even,

453
00:25:46.371 --> 00:25:50.150
you know,
the burgeoning climate problems of,
of long distance shipping and so on.

454
00:25:50.170 --> 00:25:51.320
Sure.
Um,

455
00:25:51.560 --> 00:25:53.960
and the reason I bring that up is because when you were talking about the

456
00:25:53.961 --> 00:25:56.900
triangle you walk away is over here where you're talking about coordination and

457
00:25:56.901 --> 00:26:01.730
someone like,
uh,
banks is over here.
That's right.
Who's up at the top then?

458
00:26:01.940 --> 00:26:05.570
Oh,
well that's the Huxley,
right?
That's,
that's changing what we want.

459
00:26:05.571 --> 00:26:06.740
Or Mary Condo,
right?

460
00:26:06.741 --> 00:26:09.890
That the cottage industry of convincing you that all you really want is a smooth

461
00:26:09.891 --> 00:26:14.150
river rock that reminds you of your mother as quite Ray Sickora said,

462
00:26:14.330 --> 00:26:19.190
uh,
you know,
the,
that,
that,
uh,
you know,
it's the project of Zen Buddhism,
right?

463
00:26:19.300 --> 00:26:22.450
The minimalist project,
it has it.

464
00:26:22.760 --> 00:26:25.760
The biggest enemy of minimalism is procarity.
Right.

465
00:26:25.800 --> 00:26:29.960
One of the major reasons that people hold onto stuff is because they're worried

466
00:26:29.961 --> 00:26:32.810
that their circumstances might change and they might not be able to afford to

467
00:26:32.811 --> 00:26:35.230
get it again.
And if they don't need it now,
you know,

468
00:26:35.320 --> 00:26:38.630
that's why people save their clothes from when they,

469
00:26:38.631 --> 00:26:40.640
before they lost weight or gained weight or whatever.

470
00:26:40.690 --> 00:26:44.010
It's because they know that it would cost them more to replace it in the future

471
00:26:44.010 --> 00:26:44.970
<v 2>then they might have,</v>

472
00:26:44.971 --> 00:26:48.660
and so it's worth the opportunity cost of leaving it in their closet.
Right.
Well,

473
00:26:48.661 --> 00:26:48.841
no,

474
00:26:48.841 --> 00:26:52.200
it's that whole idea that everybody had a grandmother or great grandmother who

475
00:26:52.201 --> 00:26:55.460
lived through the depression.
Sure.
Had a big ball of string.
Yeah.
Right.

476
00:26:55.470 --> 00:26:57.630
And that big Bob,
what are you going to use the big ball of string for?

477
00:26:57.780 --> 00:27:00.420
You never know what you might be able to use that big ball of string for.

478
00:27:00.780 --> 00:27:02.220
I have a homecoming ritual,

479
00:27:02.221 --> 00:27:05.400
which is throwing it all the nonworking pens in my parents' kitchen.
Right.

480
00:27:05.460 --> 00:27:10.170
Whenever I visit her on,
because they do pilot.
Oh yeah,
they do.

481
00:27:10.180 --> 00:27:12.510
And it's Gresham's law,
right?
The good pens drive out though.

482
00:27:12.530 --> 00:27:14.010
Bad pens drive out the good ones.

483
00:27:14.011 --> 00:27:16.830
Cause the good pens are the ones you take with you and your bag and lose.

484
00:27:17.070 --> 00:27:20.520
And the bad pens of the ones that stay behind.
It's just broken pencils and,

485
00:27:20.580 --> 00:27:21.151
and uh,

486
00:27:21.151 --> 00:27:25.800
you know that in this bag right now I have got like six working pens that I've

487
00:27:25.801 --> 00:27:29.430
stolen from bookstores that have been done.
There we go.

488
00:27:29.431 --> 00:27:31.920
I'm going to rise up the bad,
right because,
and then there'll be like,
oh,

489
00:27:31.921 --> 00:27:35.130
we don't have any good pens.
I was like,
I have one that's so cool.
So John,

490
00:27:35.131 --> 00:27:40.080
you are incredibly generous being at the end of your term,
of your,
of tour,
uh,

491
00:27:40.150 --> 00:27:42.930
with,
with putting the emphasis on my book here,

492
00:27:43.230 --> 00:27:45.720
but I really want to talk more about collapsing empire because it's a

493
00:27:45.721 --> 00:27:49.760
fascinating and cracking read,
right?
And you know,
you say that your,
your um,

494
00:27:50.010 --> 00:27:53.390
I cheerful quippy guy and so people mistake you for an optimist even though

495
00:27:53.391 --> 00:27:57.120
you're right about pastors.
But what I'm interested in is like,

496
00:27:57.630 --> 00:28:00.950
where's the intro?
Why the interest in bastards?
Like what,

497
00:28:00.951 --> 00:28:03.630
what are they just fun to write?
They are fun to write.
I mean,

498
00:28:03.631 --> 00:28:08.280
bastards are bastards are great fun.
You don't want them in your life.
Right.

499
00:28:08.310 --> 00:28:11.160
You know,
and we,
I,
in this particular,
in this particular book,

500
00:28:11.161 --> 00:28:12.810
I have a character who I love,

501
00:28:12.811 --> 00:28:17.130
who's one of my favorite characters that I've ever written and her name is Kiva

502
00:28:17.130 --> 00:28:21.270
Logos.
And she is amazing to read and she's amazing to watch an action.

503
00:28:21.420 --> 00:28:25.470
And you know that if she were your friend and she was calling you,
you know,

504
00:28:25.590 --> 00:28:30.450
it'd be like,
do I want to answer the phone?

505
00:28:30.451 --> 00:28:33.000
Do I want to answer the phone?
Because whatever's going to happen,

506
00:28:33.090 --> 00:28:35.400
it's going to be a thing,
right?

507
00:28:35.430 --> 00:28:38.160
And then I've got to deal with it and I didn't want to deal with it right now I

508
00:28:38.161 --> 00:28:38.994
don't have time for this.

509
00:28:39.150 --> 00:28:42.270
And you put it down and immediately afterwards there's a text that says,

510
00:28:42.420 --> 00:28:46.680
I know you're there.
Pick up the phone,
you bastard.
But with more swearing,

511
00:28:46.910 --> 00:28:51.410
but much more sweet.
She is an epic swear.
She is an epic swear.
And this is you.

512
00:28:51.480 --> 00:28:54.510
Last night we were on tour and he's,
he's like,
you don't swear very much.

513
00:28:54.570 --> 00:28:57.870
How does that,
where does that come from?
And I just stared at him,
right,

514
00:28:57.871 --> 00:29:00.750
because I am,
I,
you don't know,
I ever hear you swear.

515
00:29:00.751 --> 00:29:04.080
I must only catch you in moments of,
uh,
of great,
cheerful,

516
00:29:04.560 --> 00:29:08.010
were very well behaved.
It must be it.
But in fact,
I am,

517
00:29:08.040 --> 00:29:13.040
I am an epic swear and I come from a grand line of epics wares.

518
00:29:13.710 --> 00:29:18.500
And if you get us altogether,
um,
about 60% of our,
of our,
uh,

519
00:29:18.720 --> 00:29:22.350
discourse is swearing in one way or another.
Um,
but she's,

520
00:29:22.351 --> 00:29:26.490
so she's a great character.
Um,
but she's also,
she's also a bit of a bastard.

521
00:29:26.490 --> 00:29:30.690
She's our bastard.
So we like her.
Um,
but,
uh,

522
00:29:30.720 --> 00:29:32.190
you still have to deal with,
you know,

523
00:29:32.191 --> 00:29:35.120
what does that mean in terms of character and story.
And the other thing is,

524
00:29:35.121 --> 00:29:37.740
is as we were talking about the,
how our books,

525
00:29:37.741 --> 00:29:40.740
even though they were completely unrelated to the writing are strangely,

526
00:29:41.710 --> 00:29:46.000
he is looking at,
uh,
the world of a kind of a post collapse.

527
00:29:46.290 --> 00:29:49.330
Um,
and the in the,
uh,

528
00:29:49.380 --> 00:29:51.610
middle class and lower classes dealing with that.

529
00:29:51.790 --> 00:29:54.010
Whereas in the collapsing empire,

530
00:29:54.011 --> 00:29:58.390
it is all focused on the people who are up at the top.

531
00:29:58.391 --> 00:29:59.610
The literal aristocracy,

532
00:29:59.611 --> 00:30:04.460
literal aristocracy and their motivations are,
um,

533
00:30:04.540 --> 00:30:05.770
in some ways very,
very,

534
00:30:05.771 --> 00:30:09.700
very different because they are the main beneficiaries of this entire

535
00:30:09.701 --> 00:30:14.020
interdependent system.
The whole point of this system,
it was built.
Um,

536
00:30:14.080 --> 00:30:15.610
so that,
uh,

537
00:30:15.640 --> 00:30:20.560
the 1% or the actually the one 10th of the one 10th of the 1%,
uh,

538
00:30:20.561 --> 00:30:23.680
would benefit basically from every exchange in every transaction that would ever

539
00:30:23.681 --> 00:30:28.300
happen in trade through the space.
Um,
and so when it,

540
00:30:28.480 --> 00:30:33.100
when it,
they have evidence that it's very likely to fail.
Some of it's debatable,

541
00:30:33.250 --> 00:30:36.590
uh,
evidence,
but it is Evan very strong evidence nonetheless.
Um,

542
00:30:36.640 --> 00:30:39.340
they kind of break up into three general areas.

543
00:30:39.341 --> 00:30:43.330
There's going to be the people who say,
um,
get everybody on the boat.

544
00:30:43.331 --> 00:30:45.160
We'll kind of see how many people we can save.

545
00:30:45.690 --> 00:30:47.410
They're going to be other people who are,

546
00:30:47.411 --> 00:30:50.620
there's not enough for him in the boat for everybody.
Kick,
kick,
kick,
you know,

547
00:30:50.621 --> 00:30:52.810
they're just make sure my family is on the boat.

548
00:30:52.900 --> 00:30:54.280
And then there are the people who are like,

549
00:30:54.360 --> 00:30:57.820
I don't know whether or not things are coming to an end or not.

550
00:30:57.821 --> 00:31:00.580
All I know is I need to own that boat,
right?

551
00:31:00.760 --> 00:31:03.460
Because they're going to be the person who is,
who is in control.

552
00:31:03.550 --> 00:31:06.660
So their motivations are actually materially different.
Um,

553
00:31:06.760 --> 00:31:08.200
then hoi polloi you know,

554
00:31:08.470 --> 00:31:13.240
trying to get through their day or trying to adjust this world,
their,
uh,
their,

555
00:31:13.241 --> 00:31:17.470
uh,
focus is going to be on preservation.

556
00:31:17.650 --> 00:31:20.420
Whether its preservation on a large scale with as many people as possible to

557
00:31:20.421 --> 00:31:22.570
preservation on a small scale with fewer people will,

558
00:31:22.571 --> 00:31:27.520
preservation of wealth and capital or whatever.
Um,
and because of that,
uh,

559
00:31:27.521 --> 00:31:31.870
in many ways,
um,
the impulses that are,

560
00:31:32.040 --> 00:31:35.860
that can be valorized in those particular situations,
uh,

561
00:31:35.880 --> 00:31:39.700
seem to be the ones that also include bastardy.
Right,

562
00:31:40.390 --> 00:31:43.470
<v 3>right.
I mean it's so I love the cynicism of the,</v>

563
00:31:43.471 --> 00:31:47.380
the political system where it's a,
there's this hub that call,

564
00:31:47.410 --> 00:31:50.120
it's called hub rob that's called hub,
that all the,
all the,

565
00:31:50.130 --> 00:31:53.710
the lay lines converge on and,
um,
the,

566
00:31:53.770 --> 00:31:58.720
the power brokers have granted monopolies on different technologies,

567
00:31:58.721 --> 00:32:00.070
two different spokes,

568
00:32:00.160 --> 00:32:05.160
the Termini of different spokes of the hub such that any no one world is self

569
00:32:05.451 --> 00:32:10.430
sufficient and therefore goods always have to transit hub to get to,
to,

570
00:32:10.480 --> 00:32:14.740
to keep each of the colonies running.
And if the hub ever breaks down,

571
00:32:15.040 --> 00:32:18.840
civilization collapses across,
across space.
Um,

572
00:32:19.630 --> 00:32:21.820
so first of all,
this is a lovely bit of cynicism,

573
00:32:22.180 --> 00:32:26.020
but what I found really great was there,
there's this kind of latent thing,

574
00:32:26.021 --> 00:32:27.730
which I didn't even realize until the book was over.

575
00:32:27.731 --> 00:32:30.970
Cause as they're scrambling to make plans,
even the best of them is not saying,

576
00:32:31.210 --> 00:32:32.043
wait a second,

577
00:32:32.140 --> 00:32:36.860
how do we create resilience independent colonies before the,
the,

578
00:32:37.010 --> 00:32:39.860
uh,
hyperspace loopholes disappear,

579
00:32:40.040 --> 00:32:41.410
<v 2>uh,
because,
um,</v>

580
00:32:41.660 --> 00:32:46.580
they're going to be like literally unreachable for the next million years and

581
00:32:46.640 --> 00:32:49.520
they can't make their own food.
Right?
Right.
And no one's like,

582
00:32:49.521 --> 00:32:53.290
how do we make sure that that distant world has food?
Right.
I love that.
Right?

583
00:32:53.370 --> 00:32:57.020
We're,
we're getting a times signal here at Q and.
A.

584
00:32:57.290 --> 00:32:59.780
So what that means is to very briefly,

585
00:32:59.900 --> 00:33:04.370
there is in fact one character who is leaning in that direction.
Um,
but,

586
00:33:04.430 --> 00:33:05.000
uh,

587
00:33:05.000 --> 00:33:08.770
and the next book I believe is actually going to be about how she tries to sell

588
00:33:08.790 --> 00:33:13.220
back into 100.
Yeah.
I kind of wonder,
it ends on a cliffhanger,

589
00:33:13.340 --> 00:33:17.660
which enraged a lot of people are like,
what?
There's gotta be more.
I'm like,
look,

590
00:33:17.720 --> 00:33:22.130
you know,
there's,
it's a whole universe.
He got you.
He needs a couple of books.

591
00:33:22.131 --> 00:33:24.950
So that book has a surprise ending to the last 40%.

592
00:33:24.951 --> 00:33:29.090
It's just the same word over and over again.
Don't tell anyone it's a spoiler.

593
00:33:29.120 --> 00:33:32.430
But you know,
the punctuation,
the spacing is very different.
It's very,

594
00:33:32.431 --> 00:33:34.720
very different.
It's a,
yeah.
Steganography alright,

595
00:33:34.820 --> 00:33:37.890
so we're going to go into questions now.
Uh,
and we actually have a,

596
00:33:37.920 --> 00:33:42.720
a thing that we like to do where,
uh,
we,
uh,
Corey suggested it.

597
00:33:42.721 --> 00:33:44.930
I agree with it.
Uh,
that,
uh,

598
00:33:44.931 --> 00:33:49.931
one question comes from someone who identifies as female or non binary.

599
00:33:50.570 --> 00:33:54.260
The next one comes from someone who identifies as male and nonbinary.

600
00:33:54.290 --> 00:33:57.490
And why do we do that,
Corey?
We do that cause otherwise it's a sausage fest.

601
00:33:57.780 --> 00:34:01.660
Correct.
So we'll start with uh,

602
00:34:01.730 --> 00:34:03.590
or any people identify as female or non binary.

603
00:34:03.591 --> 00:34:06.140
You'd like to ask the first question and there's a mic runner who will come over

604
00:34:06.141 --> 00:34:10.010
for the benefit of the live stream.
Right.
So anyone raise a,
raise your hands,

605
00:34:10.370 --> 00:34:15.330
otherwise we'll move on.
There we go in back the purple.
Okay.

606
00:34:15.380 --> 00:34:17.660
We,
I recognize you from our event last night and Santa Cruz.

607
00:34:17.661 --> 00:34:22.340
Nice to see you again.
Yes.
So is the retention of wealth and moral,

608
00:34:22.910 --> 00:34:25.340
is it retention of wealth?
Immoral?
No,

609
00:34:25.341 --> 00:34:28.610
I don't think the retention of wealth is inherently immoral.

610
00:34:28.730 --> 00:34:30.670
I think there'd be the,

611
00:34:30.671 --> 00:34:35.671
there becomes a point where if your retention of wealth leads to the overall

612
00:34:37.071 --> 00:34:39.650
reduction of wellbeing of other people,

613
00:34:39.980 --> 00:34:44.960
I personally think that's immoral because my moral system says,
uh,
you know,
uh,

614
00:34:44.990 --> 00:34:49.820
do as well for everybody.
Uh,
as much as you can in a very,

615
00:34:49.821 --> 00:34:54.310
very general sort of way.
And so when the concentration of wealth,
uh,

616
00:34:54.470 --> 00:34:56.060
means for example,

617
00:34:56.180 --> 00:35:01.180
that we valorize the accumulation of wealth over say the wellbeing of people in,

618
00:35:02.831 --> 00:35:07.831
in realms of health or education or housing or any of those sorts of things.

619
00:35:08.571 --> 00:35:13.571
And it eventually becomes that you really create such a huge disparity between

620
00:35:14.211 --> 00:35:19.211
the top or most one 10th of one 10th of one 10th of 1% and literally everybody

621
00:35:20.031 --> 00:35:24.510
else in the world,
yes,
then it becomes a moral.
But in the sense of a,
in a,

622
00:35:24.511 --> 00:35:25.670
in a very real sense,

623
00:35:25.671 --> 00:35:29.990
wealth is an abstract concept that we all agree to go along.

624
00:35:30.320 --> 00:35:35.180
Um,
and so,
uh,
to some extent we all agreed to that particular delusion.

625
00:35:35.230 --> 00:35:38.010
The problem the fall down is when we,

626
00:35:38.010 --> 00:35:42.060
<v 4>that all agreed upon delusion means that the majority suffer.
Yeah.</v>

627
00:35:42.061 --> 00:35:45.330
I would take a more like Piketty version of this,
right?

628
00:35:45.331 --> 00:35:47.970
Where Piketty like basically says,
why do we,

629
00:35:48.030 --> 00:35:52.290
why do we tolerate imbalances in wealth?
Right?
Why do we not go and take,

630
00:35:52.320 --> 00:35:53.820
if we want and someone else has,

631
00:35:53.821 --> 00:35:58.110
why do we not go and take and why do we erect systems just to establish stable

632
00:35:58.111 --> 00:36:00.990
property relationships?
And his answer is that,
um,

633
00:36:01.290 --> 00:36:05.170
because when we allocate wealth,
when people can have wealth who are,
uh,

634
00:36:05.230 --> 00:36:08.310
as a result of being good allocators of wealth,
when being a good allocator,

635
00:36:08.311 --> 00:36:09.420
wealth gets you more wealth.

636
00:36:09.540 --> 00:36:12.960
So when you allocate wealth in a way that is beneficial to the world,

637
00:36:12.961 --> 00:36:15.970
you get richer,
then you get more wealth to allocate.
Um,

638
00:36:16.020 --> 00:36:20.460
and the problem is that intergenerational wealth transfer doesn't,

639
00:36:20.760 --> 00:36:23.880
uh,
doesn't create efficient capital allocations.

640
00:36:23.881 --> 00:36:26.580
And his example is to compare Liliane Bettencourt,

641
00:36:26.581 --> 00:36:30.120
who's the eras of the L'Oreal fortune was literally never worked a day of her

642
00:36:30.121 --> 00:36:30.954
life.

643
00:36:30.960 --> 00:36:34.290
And Bill Gates who founded the most successful company in the history of the

644
00:36:34.291 --> 00:36:35.910
world in his lifetime,

645
00:36:36.210 --> 00:36:41.210
and Liliane Bettencourt and Bill Gates starting from the same place at the same

646
00:36:41.281 --> 00:36:44.820
time.
Lillian Betancourt's fortune grew more than Bill Gates did,

647
00:36:45.090 --> 00:36:48.540
even though she didn't even allocate capital,
she just,

648
00:36:48.541 --> 00:36:51.450
she just like gave Capitol to other people to allocate.

649
00:36:51.750 --> 00:36:56.750
And then Bill Gates after he retired may more money still as a in total than he

650
00:36:57.151 --> 00:36:59.010
had while running the largest company in the world.

651
00:36:59.011 --> 00:37:03.630
So Bill Gates doing nothing apart from being a financial plumber as opposed to

652
00:37:03.631 --> 00:37:07.800
doing the like non commodity thing of starting a business that capital can flow

653
00:37:07.801 --> 00:37:08.634
into,
right?

654
00:37:08.790 --> 00:37:12.120
Bill Gates doesn't make as much money and so there's this kind of utilitarian,

655
00:37:12.630 --> 00:37:17.040
uh,
but market oriented reason to do redistribution to,
to,

656
00:37:17.080 --> 00:37:19.260
to care about intergenerational wealth transfer.

657
00:37:19.410 --> 00:37:22.360
But there's a simpler kind of left right version.
So there's a,

658
00:37:22.361 --> 00:37:25.710
a wonderful leftwing fantasy writer named Steven Bruce Hughes.
And I said,

659
00:37:25.740 --> 00:37:30.150
no fooling Trotskyists fantasy writer.
Yes,
he and he,
and,
and uh,

660
00:37:30.151 --> 00:37:33.930
you can tell he's a Marxist fantasy writer because he has the right ratio of

661
00:37:33.931 --> 00:37:37.170
vassals to Lourdes,
a normal,
normal,
normal.

662
00:37:37.171 --> 00:37:41.880
A fantasy writers have way too few vassals but,
uh,
he,
um,

663
00:37:41.940 --> 00:37:44.580
I was having drinks with them once and I said,

664
00:37:44.581 --> 00:37:46.950
I don't even know what left and right mean anymore.
And I said,
he said,

665
00:37:47.180 --> 00:37:50.160
it means exactly the same thing.
It's meant since the French revolution.

666
00:37:50.370 --> 00:37:54.810
You ask what is more important in property,
right or human right.
And if the,
uh,

667
00:37:55.050 --> 00:37:55.920
if the,
uh,

668
00:37:56.010 --> 00:37:59.160
person you're asking says property rights are human right there on the political

669
00:37:59.161 --> 00:38:00.690
right,
and that that's the,

670
00:38:00.691 --> 00:38:05.100
that is the question that divides the two philosophies.
And so it,
once you,

671
00:38:05.101 --> 00:38:07.710
once you come to the conclusion that it's not a human right,

672
00:38:07.711 --> 00:38:11.310
that it's merely like a utilitarian thing,
then yes,
of course there's,

673
00:38:11.340 --> 00:38:13.860
there's real problems with intergenerational wealth transfer.

674
00:38:13.920 --> 00:38:18.060
And the other thing about it,
uh,
particularly the United States is,
uh,

675
00:38:18.180 --> 00:38:21.900
people have a tendency in the United States to believe that there are two pipe

676
00:38:21.901 --> 00:38:25.080
types of people that are the millionaires and the people who are not the

677
00:38:25.081 --> 00:38:28.350
millionaires yet temporary embarrassed millionaires.
This Steinbeck called them.

678
00:38:28.620 --> 00:38:32.010
Exactly.
And if that is your fundamental view of the world,

679
00:38:32.011 --> 00:38:36.100
then ultimately,
uh,
the,
the question of

680
00:38:36.130 --> 00:38:39.880
<v 5>wealth accretion does I think 10 towards,
uh,
and morality.</v>

681
00:38:39.881 --> 00:38:44.220
So next question.
So,
uh,
I know,

682
00:38:44.530 --> 00:38:47.980
I hate to say this because I know you met your living doing this,
but,
um,

683
00:38:48.220 --> 00:38:49.240
would you,
uh,

684
00:38:49.241 --> 00:38:53.350
what do you think about the fact that to be successful in a post scarcity world,

685
00:38:53.860 --> 00:38:57.100
you have to completely ignore all intellectual property law?

686
00:38:57.940 --> 00:39:01.990
And I would argue that open source is successful because it found a way to do

687
00:39:01.991 --> 00:39:04.510
just that.
But yeah,
Corey,

688
00:39:05.000 --> 00:39:07.460
<v 4>I think you've got it wrong about,
about free and opensource software.</v>

689
00:39:07.461 --> 00:39:08.930
I actually think so.

690
00:39:08.990 --> 00:39:13.010
So I think you're right that the free software movement origins are in

691
00:39:13.011 --> 00:39:15.250
opposition to,
um,

692
00:39:15.800 --> 00:39:20.120
to the idea of copyright and patent actually to against intellectual monopoly

693
00:39:20.240 --> 00:39:22.700
more,
more,
more widely.
But it's,

694
00:39:23.450 --> 00:39:28.450
it's a brilliant hack because what Stallman did with the GPL was he created a

695
00:39:29.301 --> 00:39:32.360
regime where the more you strengthen copyright,

696
00:39:32.930 --> 00:39:37.400
the more enforceable his license that that absurd copyright became.

697
00:39:37.850 --> 00:39:39.350
And the weaker you made copyright,

698
00:39:39.380 --> 00:39:43.640
the less his license was needed to accomplish its goals.
And so he,
he,

699
00:39:43.700 --> 00:39:46.370
he created a headache heads.
I win.

700
00:39:46.400 --> 00:39:49.940
Tails you lose situation in the license.

701
00:39:50.900 --> 00:39:54.580
I think that,
um,
the idea of,
uh,
uh,

702
00:39:54.800 --> 00:39:59.800
exclusive rights over one's intellectual creations has always been,

703
00:40:03.220 --> 00:40:03.980
um,

704
00:40:03.980 --> 00:40:08.870
a battleground between the utilitarian considerations,

705
00:40:09.420 --> 00:40:13.940
self deception and um,
and emotional feelings,

706
00:40:13.941 --> 00:40:14.960
animal sentiments.

707
00:40:15.020 --> 00:40:18.440
So we have this Lockey and intuition that when we infuse something with our

708
00:40:18.441 --> 00:40:22.610
labor,
it's ours.
And that leads to the self delusion that we,

709
00:40:22.640 --> 00:40:23.870
when we infused it with our labor,

710
00:40:23.871 --> 00:40:26.660
we did not take anything from anyone else that was theirs.

711
00:40:26.810 --> 00:40:30.770
So when Edgar Allen Poe invents the detective story,
he's just making plumbing.

712
00:40:30.771 --> 00:40:35.000
When I write a detective story,
I'm making something special and uh,
and,

713
00:40:35.001 --> 00:40:39.410
and unique to me that no one can take without doing me some irreparable harm.

714
00:40:39.740 --> 00:40:42.860
And then from a utilitarian perspective,
we ask ourselves,

715
00:40:42.980 --> 00:40:46.910
would the world be a better place if you could only write a detective stories of

716
00:40:46.911 --> 00:40:48.740
Edgar Allen Poe's a state said you could.

717
00:40:49.040 --> 00:40:53.000
And it seems pretty clear that they're like detective Po was I named my daughter

718
00:40:53.001 --> 00:40:56.090
after Po.
I'm not,
I'm not,
I,
I will brief for po,

719
00:40:56.200 --> 00:40:59.330
but po had eccentric ideas and if we send to Po,

720
00:40:59.331 --> 00:41:03.780
you are the arbiter of all detective stories because of murders in the room org.

721
00:41:03.980 --> 00:41:07.820
We would be a poor world for it.
And so,
uh,

722
00:41:07.870 --> 00:41:12.870
I am a believer in evidence led a copyright and patent where we can share,

723
00:41:13.260 --> 00:41:16.910
if we can show that at the margin you produce more creativity,

724
00:41:16.911 --> 00:41:21.020
more of whatever the underlying purposes by enacting some temporary monopoly is

725
00:41:21.021 --> 00:41:24.680
specified in the constitution for the promotion of the useful arts and sciences,

726
00:41:24.920 --> 00:41:27.650
then let us do so.
But if we,
um,

727
00:41:28.130 --> 00:41:32.960
but if the only thing we're doing is pandering to the self deception,

728
00:41:33.680 --> 00:41:34.030
the,

729
00:41:34.030 --> 00:41:36.260
<v 2>the animal sentiment,
uh,</v>

730
00:41:36.290 --> 00:41:39.800
then I think we do so at the,

731
00:41:39.801 --> 00:41:43.610
at the cost of our intellectual enrichment.
Right?
Well,

732
00:41:43.611 --> 00:41:45.860
and also there's the issue of,
um,
you know,

733
00:41:45.861 --> 00:41:48.820
it is the individual versus the society thing,
right?
Uh,

734
00:41:48.830 --> 00:41:53.340
where the individual does a create something that is basically hate Gaylene in

735
00:41:53.341 --> 00:41:56.420
nature because we don't just pop things out of the air.
Uh,

736
00:41:56.421 --> 00:41:59.540
the information that exists before that,
uh,
that is your thesis.

737
00:41:59.541 --> 00:42:02.390
You add something new to it,
that's your,
uh,
antithesis.

738
00:42:02.391 --> 00:42:06.140
You get something out of it.
That synthesis,
that synthesis is your creation.
Um,

739
00:42:06.260 --> 00:42:09.310
should you benefit from it?
Sure.
Because you have done something that,
that,

740
00:42:09.340 --> 00:42:11.210
that no one else has done before,

741
00:42:11.330 --> 00:42:15.650
but you also didn't do it independent of the rest of the community in which you

742
00:42:15.651 --> 00:42:18.440
live.
We do grant as they say,
uh,

743
00:42:18.490 --> 00:42:23.270
an exclusive right to profit from it for a certain amount of time.
Um,

744
00:42:23.450 --> 00:42:26.780
but what's really important about that is that is the individual that has the

745
00:42:26.781 --> 00:42:29.900
right to profit from it,
uh,
and so on,
so forth.
So when you have,

746
00:42:29.901 --> 00:42:33.620
and the great thing about individuals is that they die right in this particular

747
00:42:33.621 --> 00:42:36.320
setup because eventually everything about,
uh,

748
00:42:36.350 --> 00:42:40.340
what the individual does stops being of importance to that individual because

749
00:42:40.341 --> 00:42:44.060
they're dead.
And then it becomes of the use to,
uh,

750
00:42:44.070 --> 00:42:46.790
the society in general unless they previously,
uh,

751
00:42:47.420 --> 00:42:50.570
licensed it or do whatever it else to,
to let it let it happen.

752
00:42:50.930 --> 00:42:54.520
When you have a situation where,
for example,
um,

753
00:42:54.740 --> 00:42:59.090
the individual dies,
um,
and then their children and grandchildren and so on,

754
00:42:59.091 --> 00:43:03.560
so forth,
then become rent seekers on that particular piece of property.

755
00:43:03.830 --> 00:43:08.180
Um,
then to go back to the question of his wealth,
uh,
and moral,

756
00:43:08.181 --> 00:43:09.400
then you start having the,

757
00:43:09.720 --> 00:43:14.180
a real question of the morality of it relative to the benefit of the society in

758
00:43:14.181 --> 00:43:16.550
general.
My personal feeling about stuff like this,

759
00:43:16.551 --> 00:43:19.100
and I think it's maybe slightly different from yours,

760
00:43:19.340 --> 00:43:24.340
is I'm a big fan of copyright for individuals being life plus 20 or 75 years,

761
00:43:25.971 --> 00:43:30.470
whichever is longer in the case of the individual because the 20 then allows

762
00:43:30.710 --> 00:43:33.500
the,
the,
uh,
the person's,
uh,

763
00:43:33.530 --> 00:43:37.110
spouse and family to get some limited benefit after that.
Um,

764
00:43:37.250 --> 00:43:41.540
but after that it goes in,
it goes into the community.
Um,
because quite honestly,

765
00:43:41.541 --> 00:43:46.430
my grandchildren should go either get their own jobs or walk away,
right?
Uh,

766
00:43:46.460 --> 00:43:50.000
one of those,
one of those two things,
uh,
for corporations,
I think 75.

767
00:43:50.001 --> 00:43:53.750
And the problem is,
is that you have folks like Disney as much as I,
you know,

768
00:43:53.770 --> 00:43:57.180
I admire Disney in many other ways,
but the fact that every time scene,

769
00:43:57.181 --> 00:44:00.500
but willy comes up to be about being put into public domain,

770
00:44:00.860 --> 00:44:05.150
they somehow magically,
uh,
get to extend the life of,

771
00:44:05.180 --> 00:44:08.110
although only one year to do it now because we're starting to,

772
00:44:08.120 --> 00:44:11.990
we're coming up against the limits of the 20 year renewal in 1998.
So we're,

773
00:44:11.991 --> 00:44:15.050
we're pretty close to it.
Don't worry,
we live in Trump's America.
I hear you.

774
00:44:15.680 --> 00:44:20.540
Where we're a legislation passes with ease.
Um,
but uh,

775
00:44:20.541 --> 00:44:22.850
so as far as,
and so as far as that goes,
I mean,

776
00:44:22.880 --> 00:44:27.620
there is that thing that at a certain point,
um,
the individual ceases to exist.

777
00:44:27.621 --> 00:44:32.160
The benefit to the individual crews from it,
um,
goes away and it has to go

778
00:44:32.160 --> 00:44:36.840
<v 3>back to the society because the society needs that had galean process to create</v>

779
00:44:37.020 --> 00:44:41.070
new and compelling stuff.
I want to suggest a gloss or a friendly amendment.

780
00:44:41.100 --> 00:44:45.210
Please do,
which is that,
um,
in addition to this,
you need an expensive,

781
00:44:45.540 --> 00:44:48.570
a safety valve for,
for a free expression.
Oh yeah.

782
00:44:48.900 --> 00:44:53.900
That doesn't prevent the author from or that doesn't allow the author to enjoin

783
00:44:54.061 --> 00:44:57.810
people from using their work to criticize their work.
Oh yeah.
And so,
you know,
I,

784
00:44:57.811 --> 00:44:58.320
I,

785
00:44:58.320 --> 00:45:03.320
I think that we worry too much about things like open licenses and too little

786
00:45:04.261 --> 00:45:08.460
about things like limitations to copyright,
like fair use.
Right.

787
00:45:08.461 --> 00:45:11.760
Our Pollstar shouldn't be,
I can write the wind done gone,

788
00:45:11.761 --> 00:45:15.420
which was a retelling of gone with the wind from the perspective of the enslaved

789
00:45:15.421 --> 00:45:18.690
people.
If Margaret Mitchell tells me I can write right.

790
00:45:18.691 --> 00:45:22.680
And therefore what we should do is kind of work on Margaret Mitchell's estate to

791
00:45:22.681 --> 00:45:25.440
let two to get her to let us tell that story.

792
00:45:25.590 --> 00:45:29.040
What we should be saying is Margaret Mitchell's the state and this is what the

793
00:45:29.040 --> 00:45:32.380
Supreme Court affirmed.
Margaret Mitchell's estate doesn't get to decide,
right.

794
00:45:32.400 --> 00:45:34.740
This is,
and so we don't have to,
and in that regard,

795
00:45:34.741 --> 00:45:37.780
like the duration of copyright becomes a lot less important.
Right.
Right.

796
00:45:37.800 --> 00:45:39.590
Cause one of the greatest problems with a copy of,

797
00:45:39.591 --> 00:45:44.591
of copyright a term is that it is accompanied by a very narrow view of

798
00:45:44.851 --> 00:45:46.340
limitations to copyright.
Right?

799
00:45:46.410 --> 00:45:50.590
And so we not only have a very long lived thing but a very wide thing right now.

800
00:45:50.970 --> 00:45:54.330
I accept this glass and endorse it and pull heartedly,
uh,

801
00:45:54.331 --> 00:45:58.650
are we doing for time timewise?
But we've got time for mark via.
Okay.

802
00:45:58.651 --> 00:46:02.710
So next question from someone who identifies as female or non binary please.
Yup.

803
00:46:02.850 --> 00:46:05.350
Right here.
Yes.

804
00:46:05.520 --> 00:46:08.740
Really curious how you came up with the ship name is Rick collapsing empire.

805
00:46:09.000 --> 00:46:13.620
Great.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Um,
uh,

806
00:46:13.680 --> 00:46:15.380
to have specific,

807
00:46:16.030 --> 00:46:20.680
<v 2>um,
it,
the,
it's a sort of sub Rosa,
not really a sub Rosa.</v>

808
00:46:20.710 --> 00:46:23.870
It's a kind of an explicit,
uh,
test,
uh,
you know,

809
00:46:23.980 --> 00:46:26.410
testimonial to Enn banks,
right?

810
00:46:27.030 --> 00:46:31.570
Whose culture series I absolutely love,
create,
you know,
creates the idea of a,

811
00:46:31.810 --> 00:46:35.860
a huge,
um,
you know,
galaxy spanning civilization.

812
00:46:36.100 --> 00:46:40.400
Now he writes with a sort of verve and complexity and,
uh,

813
00:46:40.420 --> 00:46:45.220
that I don't,
um,
and in the sense of,
you know,
even just in the sentences,
I mean,

814
00:46:45.430 --> 00:46:49.120
we all have complicated universes.
That's why you love us.
But,
uh,

815
00:46:49.180 --> 00:46:52.680
but just the fact of his culture and the way that he's built that and there's

816
00:46:52.860 --> 00:46:56.740
that,
there's so much there and even so much more implied.
Um,

817
00:46:56.830 --> 00:46:59.620
I absolutely love.
Um,
and uh,

818
00:46:59.650 --> 00:47:04.330
he and I were up for a locus of word together when I did red shirts and I

819
00:47:04.331 --> 00:47:07.240
remember,
and he had just passed or was about to pass away.

820
00:47:07.510 --> 00:47:12.190
And I remember explicitly saying to people,
I'm,
I'm absolutely happy that I've,

821
00:47:12.250 --> 00:47:16.090
I'm a finalist for this award.
If you were planning to vote for me,

822
00:47:16.091 --> 00:47:18.100
please vote for in banks.

823
00:47:18.101 --> 00:47:21.610
Because not only was the hydrogen Sonata a wonderful book in and of itself,

824
00:47:21.611 --> 00:47:26.050
but just as a,
you know,
a proxy for the entire series.

825
00:47:26.051 --> 00:47:30.880
I was like,
this would be a great time in place to,
to honor him.

826
00:47:31.290 --> 00:47:33.160
Um,
I won,
uh,

827
00:47:33.190 --> 00:47:37.030
my wife gave my acceptance speech in which I dedicated it to him because again,

828
00:47:37.031 --> 00:47:41.100
I just like,
I won,
but he should have,
um,
so this is,
this is his,
um,

829
00:47:41.200 --> 00:47:42.580
and this is my way in,

830
00:47:42.670 --> 00:47:47.670
in my creating this galaxy spanning a thing to acknowledge that Ian Banks is,

831
00:47:48.040 --> 00:47:51.700
is a master of this particular form.
Um,

832
00:47:52.000 --> 00:47:54.730
and so every time someone sees that and goes,
Huh,
it's like in banks,

833
00:47:54.910 --> 00:47:56.860
it's almost like spinning the prayer wheel,
you know,

834
00:47:56.890 --> 00:48:01.600
in my bookie in banks is remembered.
Uh,
and that actually makes me happy.

835
00:48:01.990 --> 00:48:04.490
I sneak my favorite William Gibson line until you

836
00:48:06.560 --> 00:48:09.790
get some light into about three quarters of my books,

837
00:48:09.791 --> 00:48:12.680
which is don't let the little fuckers generation gap here.
Right,
right,
right.

838
00:48:12.690 --> 00:48:15.580
And it's in like,
it appears in like half a dozen of them.

839
00:48:15.760 --> 00:48:19.710
I want to ask about that because you know,
earth has a thousand years gone,
right.

840
00:48:19.740 --> 00:48:22.150
The truth is lost to this civilization,

841
00:48:22.330 --> 00:48:25.660
but they're all cool old tin Pan Alley songs.
Do you have a continuity in mind?

842
00:48:25.661 --> 00:48:28.620
Does that kind of emerge?
Like,
why Tin Pan Alley I think.
I think,

843
00:48:29.060 --> 00:48:32.730
I think it's just basically the classical music of its time.
Oh,
right,
right.
Um,

844
00:48:32.740 --> 00:48:35.470
so they'll,
they'll pull it off.
And I think it's also,

845
00:48:35.500 --> 00:48:38.740
there may be some sort of thing where you want to eat your ship names have to be

846
00:48:38.741 --> 00:48:41.020
distinctive enough that they're not going to be a,

847
00:48:41.030 --> 00:48:42.730
that they're not going to repeat repeat,

848
00:48:43.360 --> 00:48:46.960
but at the same time have to be easy enough to remember that you can say them in

849
00:48:46.961 --> 00:48:51.400
song lyrics.
Do a really good job of that.
I think there's that thing that,

850
00:48:51.640 --> 00:48:55.280
uh,
for,
you know,
you shouldn't do this for passwords.
Uh,

851
00:48:55.360 --> 00:48:56.950
but a long time ago people were like,

852
00:48:56.951 --> 00:49:00.700
if you have a hard time remembering a thing,
just use,
uh,

853
00:49:00.870 --> 00:49:05.410
initialisms yeah.
A line or a line of lyrics from a song or something like that.

854
00:49:05.950 --> 00:49:08.500
You shouldn't do it because those,
once you actually see the pattern,

855
00:49:08.740 --> 00:49:12.400
then it gives it all away.
And even a machine can figure that out.
But,
uh,

856
00:49:12.550 --> 00:49:16.600
just the idea that you can remember a sequence of,
of,
uh,

857
00:49:16.601 --> 00:49:17.800
words better than you might remember,

858
00:49:17.801 --> 00:49:19.620
just a single word is kind of interesting too.

859
00:49:19.630 --> 00:49:21.220
There's a thing called Zoo crows triangle,

860
00:49:21.221 --> 00:49:25.930
which says that identifiers can be human readable,
unique or collision resist.

861
00:49:25.931 --> 00:49:27.340
I forget what the third one is.
Do you remember,

862
00:49:27.341 --> 00:49:31.660
remember what the third corner of is triangle was,
but,
but it is this problem,

863
00:49:31.661 --> 00:49:32.380
right?

864
00:49:32.380 --> 00:49:35.230
When you have independent people coming up with identifiers without being able

865
00:49:35.231 --> 00:49:36.520
to talk to each other,
right?
Right.

866
00:49:36.521 --> 00:49:39.850
That you have this really hard problem and you can use Hashes,
but like,
you know,

867
00:49:39.851 --> 00:49:44.620
calling your spaceship,
the 80 character hash of something is a,
it's,
it,
it lacks,

868
00:49:44.690 --> 00:49:48.030
it's not a kind of thing that people write songs about it and it's,

869
00:49:48.040 --> 00:49:50.950
it really is the difference between,
you know,
uh,
you know,

870
00:49:50.951 --> 00:49:54.700
having a personalized license plate and having a bin number.
Right,
right.
Uh,
okay,

871
00:49:54.701 --> 00:49:55.870
one last question.

872
00:49:56.030 --> 00:49:57.890
<v 6>MMM.</v>

873
00:49:58.200 --> 00:49:59.520
<v 2>You had your hand up first.
I'm sorry.</v>

874
00:49:59.870 --> 00:50:01.920
<v 5>So John,
I was curious about,
um,</v>

875
00:50:01.940 --> 00:50:06.650
you mentioned in your book that society kind of has this infrastructure that

876
00:50:06.651 --> 00:50:07.640
they take for granted.

877
00:50:07.700 --> 00:50:11.450
And then there's also been kind of this loss of knowledge as to why he existing

878
00:50:11.451 --> 00:50:12.980
principles by it kind of existed.

879
00:50:13.110 --> 00:50:16.900
And you mentioned that someone people draw the conclusion that you're maybe

880
00:50:16.910 --> 00:50:19.330
referring or it's an allegory about oil.
Um,

881
00:50:19.520 --> 00:50:24.350
but I actually think of it as an allegory for another modern day infrastructure

882
00:50:24.410 --> 00:50:29.410
that we're a little bit famous working with that people potentially take for

883
00:50:29.601 --> 00:50:32.510
granted.
Um,
and I'm,
I'm curious,

884
00:50:32.540 --> 00:50:36.800
especially with one of the groups that's currently tasked with protecting it,

885
00:50:37.030 --> 00:50:40.530
I'm also recently publishing rules to kind of erode,
um,

886
00:50:41.120 --> 00:50:44.960
key parts of why it exists and why it's important.
Um,
and,

887
00:50:44.961 --> 00:50:48.200
and just this thought that every death is kind of its own destruction of a

888
00:50:48.201 --> 00:50:52.340
library of Alexandria is,
you know,
you lose a family member.

889
00:50:52.341 --> 00:50:55.460
Maybe I should have asked them something before they left or you know,

890
00:50:55.461 --> 00:50:59.870
I lost a team member and now suddenly for code,
right?

891
00:50:59.871 --> 00:51:01.910
Like I should have called this function,
holding a lock in.

892
00:51:01.911 --> 00:51:05.170
Now I have a race condition kind of thing.
It's like this information,
it's,

893
00:51:05.220 --> 00:51:08.120
it's not quite codified,
but it's important.

894
00:51:08.180 --> 00:51:12.530
And because it wasn't distilled in because others were educated about it,

895
00:51:12.560 --> 00:51:17.180
it's kind of lost in time.
Do either of you have thoughts on how we can better,

896
00:51:17.560 --> 00:51:21.020
um,
kind of codified and educate others about these things?

897
00:51:21.880 --> 00:51:22.740
<v 3>Okay.
I,</v>

898
00:51:23.350 --> 00:51:27.040
you danced around what it was that you were actually trying to describe what I

899
00:51:27.041 --> 00:51:30.810
thought crap first you were going towards Google books or something.
Uh,

900
00:51:30.970 --> 00:51:32.490
but what is,
what is the,
for you,

901
00:51:32.620 --> 00:51:36.010
what were you referring to explicitly as curious about net neutrality?

902
00:51:36.610 --> 00:51:39.790
Neutrality.
Ah,
I'm going to let Corey talk first.
Ah,

903
00:51:41.640 --> 00:51:41.981
well look,

904
00:51:41.981 --> 00:51:45.220
I mean the network neutrality question on its face should be really easy to

905
00:51:45.221 --> 00:51:48.640
square up.
Like even if you don't want to,
even if you're,
you believe in markets,

906
00:51:48.970 --> 00:51:52.360
uh,
as the solution to everything and you think regulation is a problem.

907
00:51:52.630 --> 00:51:54.730
Phone companies don't exist without regulation,
right?

908
00:51:54.731 --> 00:51:58.150
Like arguing about whether or not phone companies should or shouldn't be

909
00:51:58.151 --> 00:52:03.100
regulated.
It's like arguing about whether or not,
um,
uh,
you know,

910
00:52:03.190 --> 00:52:07.070
uh,
ice cream should be cold,
right?
Like if you,
you're the,

911
00:52:07.071 --> 00:52:12.071
the like going Gault fiber network involves going to every basement in New York

912
00:52:13.331 --> 00:52:16.540
and paying the clearing price of digging it up to put a piece of fiber in it

913
00:52:16.750 --> 00:52:20.830
that is like a empty trillion dollars and you will never ever recoup it,
right?

914
00:52:20.830 --> 00:52:24.820
So without some regulatory intervention that gives you these literally priceless

915
00:52:24.821 --> 00:52:25.654
rights of way,

916
00:52:25.660 --> 00:52:28.420
priceless because you would get this deadlock where when you got down to the

917
00:52:28.421 --> 00:52:31.300
last two basements that control the,
the closing of the loop,

918
00:52:31.480 --> 00:52:33.040
those people would just price it at the end,

919
00:52:33.100 --> 00:52:37.090
like the entire expected return minus $1.
And so,
you know,

920
00:52:37.091 --> 00:52:40.670
there's no viable way to build a telecomm without,
um,

921
00:52:40.780 --> 00:52:43.180
without state intervention into property rights.

922
00:52:43.390 --> 00:52:45.430
And so if you're going to take the king's shilling,
right,

923
00:52:45.431 --> 00:52:49.270
if you're going to put your copper in our dirt that we clear the way for for
you,

924
00:52:49.271 --> 00:52:51.790
then you have,
uh,
we have a,
uh,

925
00:52:51.880 --> 00:52:56.080
you have an obligation to operate that copper in the public interest and you are

926
00:52:56.081 --> 00:52:58.780
welcome to run your network any way you want.

927
00:52:58.810 --> 00:53:01.600
If you're going to pay all the clearing costs associated with it,

928
00:53:01.780 --> 00:53:04.210
but when you're going to use our large s right,

929
00:53:04.211 --> 00:53:05.560
when you're going to take a giant subsidy,

930
00:53:05.561 --> 00:53:08.590
that subsidy comes with a quid pro quo and that quid pro quo is,

931
00:53:08.591 --> 00:53:11.770
you can give me the bits I asked for when I asked for them as quickly as you can

932
00:53:11.950 --> 00:53:15.280
not,
you know,
like trading me to another prisoner for a pack of cigarettes,
right?

933
00:53:15.280 --> 00:53:19.180
Going to one pro one,
one company or another and saying like,

934
00:53:19.181 --> 00:53:20.750
how much will you pay me to,

935
00:53:20.780 --> 00:53:25.090
to get your bits to Mr doctor o faster than you know,
uh,

936
00:53:25.180 --> 00:53:26.640
the guys down the road.
Well,

937
00:53:26.880 --> 00:53:31.880
and the fact that you have people who claim to be market supporters who are

938
00:53:34.140 --> 00:53:37.960
unable to understand this is tells you that like the,

939
00:53:37.961 --> 00:53:41.220
the thing gets menkens aphorism that it's impossible to get someone to

940
00:53:41.221 --> 00:53:44.470
understand something when his paycheck depends on him not understanding it.
That,

941
00:53:44.490 --> 00:53:45.480
that,
you know,

942
00:53:45.481 --> 00:53:50.481
the arguments are so crummy for allowing network discrimination and Susan

943
00:53:52.230 --> 00:53:54.000
Crawford had a great op ed about it today.

944
00:53:54.120 --> 00:53:59.120
I think that we are almost at the point where maybe network neutrality will uh,

945
00:54:00.060 --> 00:54:05.010
be very hard to take away because we are almost at the point where we have

946
00:54:05.011 --> 00:54:10.011
pretty good networks for enough people that taking that away will cause them to

947
00:54:10.621 --> 00:54:13.530
rise up because it's very hard to get people exercise to a bit of a thing

948
00:54:13.531 --> 00:54:16.320
they've never had that we were telling them their future has been stolen from

949
00:54:16.321 --> 00:54:17.101
them.
Right.
You know,

950
00:54:17.101 --> 00:54:21.360
this is one of the problems with DRM is that we say like w there are all these

951
00:54:21.361 --> 00:54:24.870
devices that should exist now but don't because it's against the law to break

952
00:54:24.871 --> 00:54:26.580
DRM even for a legal purpose.

953
00:54:26.581 --> 00:54:30.870
And so you stick a CD in your computer and it wakes up some software that came

954
00:54:30.871 --> 00:54:33.630
for the manufacturer that says,
I see you're visiting us from the 20th century.

955
00:54:33.631 --> 00:54:37.360
Would you like to move your music into the 21st and handily?
Puts it on your,

956
00:54:37.361 --> 00:54:40.560
on your mobile device and lets you turn it into a ringtone alarm tone and

957
00:54:40.561 --> 00:54:41.310
everything else.

958
00:54:41.310 --> 00:54:45.240
Stick a DVD and it all it will do was what it could do in 1996 which is play it

959
00:54:45.241 --> 00:54:49.690
right 20 years,
not one new feature added to DVD and um,

960
00:54:49.910 --> 00:54:51.660
p people don't notice.
Right.

961
00:54:51.661 --> 00:54:55.530
They don't even notice that there is nothing that happens when you do with a DVD

962
00:54:55.650 --> 00:54:59.190
that when you put a DVD in,
apart from what it did 20 years ago,

963
00:54:59.850 --> 00:55:04.850
but if they could do all the things with DVDs that they can do with cds and then

964
00:55:04.921 --> 00:55:09.180
we told them they couldn't do it anymore,
there would be blood in the streets.

965
00:55:09.540 --> 00:55:14.540
And what Obama was very canny about was creating an unsustainable healthcare

966
00:55:14.580 --> 00:55:19.470
system that nevertheless insured 22 million uninsured people who were then when

967
00:55:19.471 --> 00:55:22.920
that system ran up against the limits of the compromises he had to make with the

968
00:55:22.921 --> 00:55:25.830
insurers to get it through would instead of saying,

969
00:55:25.831 --> 00:55:28.230
all right then I guess we'll go back to the old bad ways would,

970
00:55:28.231 --> 00:55:30.930
would then plump for single payer.
Yeah.
No,

971
00:55:30.931 --> 00:55:33.480
I was wondering when we would get to health care on that because that is

972
00:55:35.720 --> 00:55:37.650
cause by,
that is the one that they know

973
00:55:37.950 --> 00:55:42.360
<v 2>that really does bring a point to what he's saying there.</v>

974
00:55:42.361 --> 00:55:47.361
I mean the fact is is that if all of a sudden I have to pay an extra $20 for the

975
00:55:47.371 --> 00:55:49.770
tier that allows me to get Netflix,
right,

976
00:55:50.130 --> 00:55:54.810
which I already get for free minus the Netflix subscription costs or the tier

977
00:55:54.811 --> 00:55:58.260
that,
that it basically goes into the cable model,
um,

978
00:55:58.290 --> 00:56:00.080
then people are going,
yeah,

979
00:56:00.180 --> 00:56:04.530
people are going to freak out about it because they,

980
00:56:05.040 --> 00:56:08.900
they already have it.
That's there already ground level expectation and it's the,

981
00:56:08.901 --> 00:56:09.091
the,

982
00:56:09.091 --> 00:56:13.590
once you give people something and you'd give it sufficient time to take root as

983
00:56:13.591 --> 00:56:17.910
that is the expectation,
that is always going to be a part of that expectation.

984
00:56:17.911 --> 00:56:22.470
And you do have any,
and you do have basically what are I would say,
uh,

985
00:56:22.471 --> 00:56:24.340
Randy and acolytes going,
well,
no,

986
00:56:24.341 --> 00:56:26.400
we should actually do it this particular way and,

987
00:56:26.590 --> 00:56:31.570
and pair away everything that doesn't allow you to or that,
that,
uh,

988
00:56:31.750 --> 00:56:35.650
has anything to do with the government doing anything other than shooting people

989
00:56:36.280 --> 00:56:37.780
and saying,
oh no,
this is more efficient.

990
00:56:37.780 --> 00:56:41.490
And of course we can trust other people to do that.
Um,
and it,

991
00:56:41.491 --> 00:56:42.970
it just doesn't work.
I mean,

992
00:56:43.240 --> 00:56:48.240
implicit in a lot of the philosophies that lead to something like breaking net

993
00:56:48.371 --> 00:56:50.900
neutrality or taking away the,
uh,

994
00:56:50.950 --> 00:56:54.450
health care that other people have is the assumption that,
um,

995
00:56:54.760 --> 00:56:59.380
the only things that exist are you and the ground no more than six feet under

996
00:56:59.381 --> 00:57:03.700
you.
Right?
And so that everything else will just sort of take care of itself.

997
00:57:03.850 --> 00:57:05.050
And of course it doesn't.
And that's,
uh,

998
00:57:05.110 --> 00:57:08.520
that's the aspect I think of both of our books.
Everything is interconnected.

999
00:57:08.540 --> 00:57:13.030
Everything works together or it doesn't.
But there's always going to be,
uh,

1000
00:57:13.120 --> 00:57:16.120
factors that you have to deal with.
Uh,
I obviously,

1001
00:57:16.240 --> 00:57:18.730
and I think this is a noncontroversial statement,

1002
00:57:18.731 --> 00:57:23.560
think that trying to reverse the net neutrality is purely a stupid,

1003
00:57:23.830 --> 00:57:27.820
uh,
it doesn't benefit anyone but a certain number of small people,
again,

1004
00:57:27.850 --> 00:57:32.320
up at the top.
Um,
it,
uh,
is going to present real issues for,

1005
00:57:32.520 --> 00:57:35.650
uh,
the vast majority of people at the bottom,
uh,

1006
00:57:35.651 --> 00:57:40.270
and the potential for the Internet,
uh,
and the potential for these networks,

1007
00:57:40.480 --> 00:57:42.880
uh,
which is to,
um,

1008
00:57:42.940 --> 00:57:47.380
ha who have the potential to raise up and then flatten out.
Uh,

1009
00:57:47.410 --> 00:57:51.970
things like access,
things like education,
things like,
uh,
communication,

1010
00:57:52.210 --> 00:57:52.720
uh,

1011
00:57:52.720 --> 00:57:57.720
goes away simply for the benefit of three or four or five companies and the

1012
00:58:00.161 --> 00:58:04.120
attendance,
CEO's and executive class with those shareholders.
You know,
and,
and,

1013
00:58:04.121 --> 00:58:04.871
and bluntly,

1014
00:58:04.871 --> 00:58:07.630
and I'm sorry that I'm going to use a bad word here on the Google streaming

1015
00:58:07.631 --> 00:58:11.110
thing.
Fuck that.
You know,
I'm not,
I'm not here for the top 10.

1016
00:58:11.111 --> 00:58:14.680
I'm speaking as someone who is in the 1% myself.
I'm not here for,

1017
00:58:14.710 --> 00:58:15.401
for those people.

1018
00:58:15.401 --> 00:58:20.200
I want the benefit of this for everyone because I also have come down from the

1019
00:58:20.201 --> 00:58:22.120
very bottom of our,
you know,

1020
00:58:22.160 --> 00:58:27.160
US society and I know how crappy and how awful it is and how trivial it is to

1021
00:58:27.641 --> 00:58:31.030
improve the lives of people,
uh,

1022
00:58:31.090 --> 00:58:36.040
at the bottom through things like access to computers,
to things like networks,

1023
00:58:36.160 --> 00:58:41.080
to things like education.
Um,
and so every time,
uh,

1024
00:58:41.110 --> 00:58:45.100
you know,
you have an administration like this administration,
uh,

1025
00:58:45.101 --> 00:58:48.070
which is just full scale and you know,
uh,
let's,

1026
00:58:48.370 --> 00:58:53.370
let's sprint as fast as we possibly can towards oligarchy cause to the rest of

1027
00:58:54.851 --> 00:58:59.420
you.
Um,
then yeah,
I,
you get my back up.
Um,
so,
uh,

1028
00:58:59.470 --> 00:59:01.870
the current head of the FCC can,
uh,

1029
00:59:01.900 --> 00:59:05.080
go dunk his head in the toilet and flush several times.
As far as I'm concerned,

1030
00:59:05.350 --> 00:59:06.500
we need net neutrality.

1031
00:59:11.310 --> 00:59:12.143
<v 1>Yeah,
exactly.</v>

1032
00:59:13.280 --> 00:59:15.760
<v 2>Let's hear it again for John and Corey.
That was awesome.</v>

1033
00:59:16.350 --> 00:59:16.460
<v 1>Okay.</v>
