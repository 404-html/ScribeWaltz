WEBVTT

1
00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:07.080
Thanks for hosting me.

2
00:00:07.920 --> 00:00:12.330
I realized I should probably just cover my history for anyone who didn't know.
I,

3
00:00:12.331 --> 00:00:17.010
uh,
I grew up in the 1980s programming in logo.

4
00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:20.820
Uh,
I learned how to do the triangles.
I learned how to do the turtles.

5
00:00:20.821 --> 00:00:24.750
Can I actually just get a show of hands?
Who here has programmed in logo?

6
00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:27.690
It's amazing.
You know,
I was at,
I was at,
uh,

7
00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:31.500
I spoke at a business conference the other day.
No one raised their hands.
I said,

8
00:00:31.501 --> 00:00:35.820
okay,
who is programmed in Lisp?
No one.
I said,
who here's heard of Lisp?

9
00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:42.450
He was like,
wow,
it's just all r and python these days.
So yeah.
Um,

10
00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:47.190
yeah,
so I grew up,
uh,
I grew up on logo,
uh,
in the nineties.

11
00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:52.110
I,
uh,
I,
so I should,
my wife and I,
uh,

12
00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:54.450
who's here,
uh,
uh,

13
00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:57.390
majored in computer science and we worked at Microsoft and I'm going to be

14
00:00:57.391 --> 00:01:01.890
talking a bit about that.
And then after a couple of years at Microsoft,

15
00:01:01.891 --> 00:01:02.550
we came to Google.

16
00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:06.840
We were here and I was here in the two thousands and I worked on the uh,

17
00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:11.610
web mirror team,
which was part of the part of the crawl back then.
And um,

18
00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:13.740
because I was a little crazy,

19
00:01:13.741 --> 00:01:18.150
I decided to give it up and become a writer and critic and technologists.

20
00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:21.390
And this is sort of the result of my book.
Um,

21
00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:25.200
and uh,
but it's really good to be back.
This,

22
00:01:25.201 --> 00:01:28.710
I mean we were on the fourth floor back then and this brings back a lot of

23
00:01:28.711 --> 00:01:33.630
memories.
So this is a very,
uh,
the,
the,
this,
this has a special meaning for me.

24
00:01:33.631 --> 00:01:37.040
So I was going to read a couple sections that,
uh,

25
00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:42.160
hopefully are relevant to more computer oriented computer oriented people.

26
00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:47.040
Uh,
but first I want,
um,
as proof of my Bona Fides,

27
00:01:47.041 --> 00:01:49.820
you may notice that it's called bitwise and uh,

28
00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:53.840
those are actual bitwise operators on the cover or something I made sure I was

29
00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:56.630
so that people would say no,
I just didn't look in a,
a,

30
00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:58.530
I just didn't look in a library of computer terms.

31
00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:00.360
It's pick one that sounded cool.

32
00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:04.140
The real discovery though was this bit of art by,
um,

33
00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:09.450
by Richard McGuire.
He's a cartoonist who does some New Yorker covers.

34
00:02:09.480 --> 00:02:12.870
And,
um,
if you notice the pipe and the ampersand,

35
00:02:12.871 --> 00:02:15.060
those are indeed bitwise operators.

36
00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:19.020
And I was very happy to find that piece of art and uh,

37
00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:23.110
and use it.
Uh,
so,
uh,
the,

38
00:02:23.111 --> 00:02:26.460
the first part I'd like to speak about is,
um,

39
00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:30.810
is actually a tale of my time at Microsoft.
And bizarrely enough,

40
00:02:30.811 --> 00:02:35.070
we have someone here who was actually there at the time on the very same team.

41
00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:39.510
So,
uh,
he can,
he can verify that I'm not embellishing this.
Uh,
and this,

42
00:02:39.511 --> 00:02:44.130
this section is called a chat wars and it begins with a,

43
00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:46.740
uh,
with a quote from Grace Hopper.
Uh,

44
00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:50.100
it's easier to ask forgiveness than it is to get permission.

45
00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:54.570
And now you'll see why at 22,

46
00:02:54.571 --> 00:02:57.510
when I was just out of college and still agree in software engineer,

47
00:02:57.540 --> 00:03:00.970
I thought America Online and AOL won the battle,

48
00:03:00.971 --> 00:03:04.450
made the front page of the New York Times the public was beginning to care about

49
00:03:04.451 --> 00:03:05.284
code.

50
00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:08.230
This wasn't the code that would crack the secrets of mathematics or the nature

51
00:03:08.231 --> 00:03:11.380
of the universe,
but it was the lifeblood of our economy and society.

52
00:03:12.070 --> 00:03:16.000
It was a summer of 1999 and people were starting to realize that the Internet

53
00:03:16.001 --> 00:03:19.930
and the web,
we're becoming a new dynamic circulatory system for informations,

54
00:03:19.931 --> 00:03:24.580
coordination,
and life itself.
The summer before my final year of college,

55
00:03:24.610 --> 00:03:27.910
I interned as a software engineer at Microsoft in Redmond.

56
00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:31.270
I was assigned to the group that was building Msn Messenger Service,

57
00:03:31.300 --> 00:03:35.110
Microsoft's instant messaging APP,
and after receiving my degree,

58
00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:36.610
I went on to join them full time.

59
00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:40.270
The unwieldy name was cooked up by Microsoft and marketing department,

60
00:03:40.271 --> 00:03:43.720
which had a reputation for always picking the clunkiest and least imaginative

61
00:03:43.721 --> 00:03:47.980
product names,
but he lists,
see,
you see me,
Msn Messenger?
No,

62
00:03:48.190 --> 00:03:51.640
it was MSN messenger service,
but I'll call it messenger for short.

63
00:03:52.600 --> 00:03:56.350
At the time,
the big players and instant messaging where AOL instant messenger,

64
00:03:56.380 --> 00:04:00.460
Yahoo and Icq,
uh,
AOL instant messenger,

65
00:04:00.490 --> 00:04:03.280
aim for short had tens of millions of users.

66
00:04:03.370 --> 00:04:06.760
AOL had become the country's biggest dialup provider in the mid nineties by

67
00:04:06.761 --> 00:04:11.470
blitzing mailboxes with CD Roms and all AOL users automatically became aim

68
00:04:11.471 --> 00:04:14.740
users,
Yahoo and ICQ.
Each had millions of users.

69
00:04:15.010 --> 00:04:18.910
These are paltry numbers by the standards of 2018 but they were meaningful.

70
00:04:18.911 --> 00:04:23.020
In the 90s
after my team

71
00:04:25.630 --> 00:04:27.070
finished developing the client code,

72
00:04:27.071 --> 00:04:30.970
we had some downtime while waiting for the server team to finish their hotmail

73
00:04:30.971 --> 00:04:33.160
integration.
We couldn't release without their work.

74
00:04:33.370 --> 00:04:34.900
We fixed every bug we could find.

75
00:04:35.590 --> 00:04:39.100
One of the problems was getting new users to join messenger when so many people

76
00:04:39.101 --> 00:04:43.180
already used other chat programs.
Um,
unlike email,
email,

77
00:04:43.210 --> 00:04:47.860
which has the standard SMTP format across all programs,

78
00:04:47.890 --> 00:04:51.310
these chat work networks didn't talk to each other.
Aol didn't talk to Yahoo,

79
00:04:51.340 --> 00:04:54.190
which I didn't talk to Icq and none of them would talk to us.

80
00:04:54.880 --> 00:04:56.380
AOL had the largest user base.

81
00:04:56.380 --> 00:05:00.450
So we discussed the possibility of adding code to allow Messenger to log into

82
00:05:00.460 --> 00:05:02.020
two servers simultaneously,

83
00:05:02.320 --> 00:05:06.100
Microsofts and AOL so that users could see their messenger and aim buddies on a

84
00:05:06.101 --> 00:05:09.970
single list and talk to aim buddies via messenger.
We called it interrupt.

85
00:05:11.270 --> 00:05:16.270
A aims protocol was known as Oscar stood for acronym for open system for

86
00:05:16.331 --> 00:05:20.740
communication in real time.
Uh,
it was undocumented.
Uh,

87
00:05:20.741 --> 00:05:22.030
so,
uh,

88
00:05:22.060 --> 00:05:25.750
me and my mentor at the time signed up for AME accounts and watch the AME client

89
00:05:25.751 --> 00:05:29.500
talk to the server using a network monitor.
I saw the protocol.

90
00:05:29.501 --> 00:05:30.820
The aim was using my mentor.

91
00:05:30.821 --> 00:05:35.050
Chris had figured out a large chunk of Oscar this way and after he left the
team,

92
00:05:35.110 --> 00:05:38.320
I picked up his work and finish the job.
Um,

93
00:05:39.540 --> 00:05:41.680
um,
so,
you know,

94
00:05:41.681 --> 00:05:45.190
did all notice that there were some odd messages heading their way from Redmond?

95
00:05:45.640 --> 00:05:46.450
Probably not.

96
00:05:46.450 --> 00:05:50.230
They attended tens millions of users and we were mimicking their protocol

97
00:05:50.231 --> 00:05:51.064
reasonably well.

98
00:05:51.520 --> 00:05:54.730
But I thought this little stunt would be deemed to dubious and excised from

99
00:05:54.731 --> 00:05:57.010
messenger before it shit.
But management liked it.

100
00:05:57.530 --> 00:06:00.050
So on July 22nd,
1999,

101
00:06:00.051 --> 00:06:03.500
Microsoft entered the chat markets with Msn Messenger Service,

102
00:06:03.570 --> 00:06:05.420
a complete with all interrupt.

103
00:06:06.140 --> 00:06:10.310
No one had warned all of our gambit and they weren't happy with what we termed

104
00:06:10.440 --> 00:06:14.870
are with what we termed our unauthorized interoperability.
Quickly.

105
00:06:14.871 --> 00:06:17.750
They blocked messenger from connecting to their servers by veering their

106
00:06:17.751 --> 00:06:20.270
protocol messages in ways we hadn't anticipated.

107
00:06:20.780 --> 00:06:23.960
Users who tried to contact their aim buddies from messenger would receive a

108
00:06:23.961 --> 00:06:25.430
popup instant message saying,

109
00:06:25.640 --> 00:06:29.240
use an authorized AOL client at this link with the euro.

110
00:06:29.660 --> 00:06:33.410
But as long as messengers sent exactly the same protocol messages to the AOL

111
00:06:33.411 --> 00:06:36.800
servers,
Ala wouldn't be able to detect that a user was on messenger.

112
00:06:37.220 --> 00:06:40.430
So I took the AME client and meticulously check for differences in what it was

113
00:06:40.431 --> 00:06:42.920
sending and then changed our client to mimic it.
Once again,

114
00:06:43.490 --> 00:06:45.890
messenger users receive an upgrade with this new fix.

115
00:06:45.920 --> 00:06:50.810
And because this was the dial up days,
uh,
the fix,
uh,
the client was tiny.

116
00:06:50.811 --> 00:06:53.540
He was literally 300 k was not even a megabyte,

117
00:06:54.080 --> 00:06:57.140
but AOL again caught on and switched their protocol up.

118
00:06:57.560 --> 00:06:59.540
We matched their client again,
pushed out another upgrade.

119
00:06:59.570 --> 00:07:03.050
We went back and forth at least a dozen times at one point.

120
00:07:03.051 --> 00:07:07.520
AOL sneakily excluded users logging on from Microsoft headquarters,
uh,

121
00:07:07.550 --> 00:07:11.300
ips from their changes so that we would be unaware that either messenger users

122
00:07:11.301 --> 00:07:15.500
were receiving an error message after an hour or two scratching our heads.

123
00:07:15.501 --> 00:07:18.020
A team member's sick at home notified us that yes,

124
00:07:18.021 --> 00:07:21.560
she was getting disconnected and a shout out to Kara for,

125
00:07:21.561 --> 00:07:25.400
for doing that amazing work when we were all going crazy.

126
00:07:26.150 --> 00:07:28.910
Uh,
Microsoft know we're both tech titans.

127
00:07:28.911 --> 00:07:33.290
In 1999 soon the press got a hold of the story.
On July 24th,

128
00:07:33.291 --> 00:07:37.190
The New York Times rooted in cyberspace rivals skirmish over messaging.

129
00:07:37.580 --> 00:07:40.700
Aol kept blocking us or read the paper of record quote,

130
00:07:40.850 --> 00:07:44.390
but Microsoft refused to roll over late Friday.
The software giant said it did,

131
00:07:44.391 --> 00:07:48.500
revised its Msn Messenger program to circumvent a miracle online's roadblock

132
00:07:48.890 --> 00:07:52.250
within hours.
America Online answered that challenge with a new block.

133
00:07:52.850 --> 00:07:55.850
It was like reading about a wrestling match in which I was in the studious mass

134
00:07:55.851 --> 00:07:59.570
challenge.
Okay,
so another quote,

135
00:07:59.571 --> 00:08:04.400
this is from the great 20th century.
Um,
polymath,

136
00:08:04.980 --> 00:08:08.060
uh,
Jacob Aronofsky,
uh,

137
00:08:08.120 --> 00:08:10.700
progress is the exploration of our own error.

138
00:08:10.730 --> 00:08:14.940
And I think anyone who's been a software engineer sure knows that.
Um,

139
00:08:15.050 --> 00:08:19.010
so the messenger war was a rush coming into work every morning to see whether

140
00:08:19.011 --> 00:08:23.900
the client's still worked with AOL was thrilling,
even if it usually wasn't.
Um,

141
00:08:24.290 --> 00:08:25.280
when it wasn't working,

142
00:08:25.310 --> 00:08:28.280
I looked through them reams of protocol messages to figure out what it changed,

143
00:08:28.281 --> 00:08:31.850
fixed the client,
try to get an update out the same day.
Uh,

144
00:08:31.880 --> 00:08:33.590
I had no idea who my adversaries were,

145
00:08:33.591 --> 00:08:36.950
but I had been challenged and I wanted to win and our users care too.

146
00:08:36.951 --> 00:08:39.050
And they wanted us to win.
And this was,
you know,

147
00:08:39.051 --> 00:08:41.430
having actual users on your side at Microsoft.

148
00:08:41.431 --> 00:08:45.260
And those days are usually somewhat unusual.
So A,

149
00:08:45.261 --> 00:08:49.460
we'll try different tactics.
At one point,
uh,
I thought that they identify,

150
00:08:49.480 --> 00:08:52.100
we're identifying the Microsoft client because it wasn't downloading the

151
00:08:52.101 --> 00:08:54.290
advertising that the AOL client download it.

152
00:08:54.590 --> 00:08:58.680
So I updated our client to download it all and throw it away.
Hey,

153
00:08:58.681 --> 00:09:01.560
we'll include a mysterious protocol and messages that didn't seem to affect

154
00:09:01.561 --> 00:09:04.710
their client but broke ours.
So I fixed that.
One day.

155
00:09:04.980 --> 00:09:08.250
I came in to see this embedded in the messengers from the AOL server.

156
00:09:08.400 --> 00:09:13.110
Hi Dash Mark.
It was a little missive from engineer to engineer,

157
00:09:13.111 --> 00:09:17.130
hidden from the corporate media and PR worlds that we're arguing over us.
Uh,

158
00:09:17.131 --> 00:09:21.540
I felt solidarity with him even though we were on opposing sides.
Uh,

159
00:09:21.630 --> 00:09:22.261
in the press,

160
00:09:22.261 --> 00:09:26.010
Ayla was pushing pop propaganda about how Microsoft had behaving like an evil

161
00:09:26.011 --> 00:09:30.300
hacker by asking for AOL passwords.
Um,
uh,

162
00:09:30.570 --> 00:09:31.890
but this wasn't true,

163
00:09:31.891 --> 00:09:35.070
but we were allowed only to respond through the PR department.

164
00:09:35.071 --> 00:09:37.200
My team was sealed off,
but our code wasn't.

165
00:09:38.010 --> 00:09:40.410
And then one day AOL stop blocking us.

166
00:09:40.860 --> 00:09:44.310
It was strange to encounter sudden silence is the enemy had abruptly yield of

167
00:09:44.311 --> 00:09:48.330
the battlefield.
And while I wanted to believe we'd one I suspected AOL would,

168
00:09:48.460 --> 00:09:49.920
wouldn't give up without a word.

169
00:09:50.550 --> 00:09:53.760
And a week later we found that messenger had been blocked again.

170
00:09:53.790 --> 00:09:55.080
But this time was different.

171
00:09:55.740 --> 00:09:59.850
The oil server was sending a huge chunk of new gobbledygook gook that I could

172
00:09:59.851 --> 00:10:04.380
not understand and it looked like this.
The first couple of lines are,

173
00:10:04.440 --> 00:10:08.250
are the standard AOL protocol header,
the two eight oh two seven seven,

174
00:10:08.260 --> 00:10:11.770
nine c this is all fairly standard stuff.
Um,

175
00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:15.420
but from these 90,
90,
90,
90 onward,

176
00:10:15.750 --> 00:10:20.670
it was incomprehensible and wasn't been been any relation to anything.

177
00:10:20.671 --> 00:10:22.470
The AOL servers,
it's not their client or ours.

178
00:10:22.471 --> 00:10:27.450
The vast expanse of double zeros in the middle was also mysterious since a bunch

179
00:10:27.451 --> 00:10:31.080
of Zeros couldn't contain much meaning.
Um,
our client ignored it,

180
00:10:31.081 --> 00:10:34.590
but the AOL client responded to the scholarly book with a shorter version of the

181
00:10:34.591 --> 00:10:37.830
same gobbledygook.
I didn't know what it was and it was maddening.

182
00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:40.380
After staring at it for half a day,

183
00:10:40.381 --> 00:10:44.340
I went over to Jonathan and brilliant surveyor engineer on our team and asked

184
00:10:44.341 --> 00:10:47.490
what he thought and he looked at it for a few minutes and he said,
this is code,

185
00:10:47.950 --> 00:10:52.680
uh,
specifically.
Well,
that's code.
Actually most of it's code,

186
00:10:52.681 --> 00:10:55.740
but the most important part is down here as you might guess,

187
00:10:55.770 --> 00:10:59.820
it was actual x 86 assembly code.
The repeated nineties,

188
00:10:59.821 --> 00:11:03.480
a tipped them off because they signify a no op instruction.

189
00:11:03.490 --> 00:11:06.990
X86 assembler telling the processor to do nothing for one cycle.

190
00:11:07.590 --> 00:11:08.880
So the pieces came together.

191
00:11:09.030 --> 00:11:12.630
Normally protocol messages read data not as cold,

192
00:11:12.631 --> 00:11:16.200
but a and wells client had a security bug in it.

193
00:11:16.260 --> 00:11:20.580
It had a buffer overflow in it.
Um,
and actually let me ask,

194
00:11:20.581 --> 00:11:22.260
how many people know what a buffer overflow is?

195
00:11:22.261 --> 00:11:23.790
I'm going to skip over all everyone.

196
00:11:23.791 --> 00:11:27.210
We're going to skip over that actually for all the viewers and TV land,

197
00:11:27.211 --> 00:11:30.030
it basically means that they don't,
um,

198
00:11:30.090 --> 00:11:34.820
is that you can run over the edge of a,
of a,
of a,
uh,

199
00:11:34.830 --> 00:11:39.600
have an assigned spot in memory and,
uh,
overwrite the program code,

200
00:11:39.660 --> 00:11:40.860
uh,
with whatever you want.

201
00:11:41.370 --> 00:11:45.780
So they were overriding it with x 86 assembler and the,

202
00:11:46.410 --> 00:11:50.100
uh,
and they were controlling the function of the AOL client.

203
00:11:50.670 --> 00:11:54.940
It's a huge security call fall,
uh,
since,
uh,

204
00:11:55.030 --> 00:11:58.420
and AOL knew about this bug in the program and now they were exploiting it.

205
00:11:58.840 --> 00:12:01.600
The Double Zeros were filling up space in the programs buffer.

206
00:12:01.630 --> 00:12:03.160
And once it hit the end of the buffer,

207
00:12:03.190 --> 00:12:06.760
it a overwrote the executable code with the remainder of the protocol message.

208
00:12:07.210 --> 00:12:08.200
The,
uh,

209
00:12:08.320 --> 00:12:13.150
this is the new code which caused the client to look up a particular

210
00:12:13.180 --> 00:12:16.240
configurable address in memory and send it back to the server.

211
00:12:16.900 --> 00:12:20.680
And this was tricky man,
much trickier than anything they'd done so far.

212
00:12:21.010 --> 00:12:25.630
And it was a bit outside the realm of fair play hacking into their own client

213
00:12:25.631 --> 00:12:30.430
using an unfixed security hole,
a hole that our client did not possess.

214
00:12:30.510 --> 00:12:35.050
It was a,
uh,
Rommel you magnificent bastard moment and I was out of my depth,

215
00:12:35.710 --> 00:12:37.900
uh,
someone else at Microsoft.

216
00:12:37.930 --> 00:12:40.720
I never found out who told the press about the buffer overflow,

217
00:12:40.721 --> 00:12:44.740
figuring that if people knew that the AOL client had a huge security hole in it,

218
00:12:45.220 --> 00:12:47.080
AOL would be forced to patch their client.

219
00:12:47.081 --> 00:12:51.610
I would no longer be able to exploit it.
So according to the security expert,

220
00:12:51.611 --> 00:12:55.540
Richard and Smith,
a certain fill bucking of bucking consulting,

221
00:12:55.541 --> 00:12:59.380
sent him an email alerting him to the buffer overflow in the AOL client.

222
00:13:00.330 --> 00:13:01.163
Dear Mr. Smith,

223
00:13:01.180 --> 00:13:04.840
I am a developer who has been working on a revolutionary new instant messaging

224
00:13:04.841 --> 00:13:07.660
client that should be released later this year.
Because of that,

225
00:13:07.690 --> 00:13:11.020
I followed with interest the battle between AOL and Microsoft and had been

226
00:13:11.021 --> 00:13:15.250
trying to understand exactly what AOL is doing to block Microsoft and how

227
00:13:15.251 --> 00:13:18.880
Microsoft is getting around the blocks.
Up until very recently,

228
00:13:18.910 --> 00:13:22.870
it's been pretty standard stuff.
But now I fear AOL has gone too far.

229
00:13:23.560 --> 00:13:27.010
It appears that the Ame client has a buffer overflow book by itself.

230
00:13:27.011 --> 00:13:30.520
This may not be the end of the world as Microsoft is surely had its share.

231
00:13:33.910 --> 00:13:35.440
Yes,
yes.

232
00:13:35.710 --> 00:13:40.710
But AOL is now exploiting their own buffer overflow bug to help its efforts to

233
00:13:40.871 --> 00:13:45.850
block MSN instant messenger.
Um,
so,
um,

234
00:13:46.230 --> 00:13:47.170
it ham fisted,

235
00:13:47.171 --> 00:13:52.000
I think the developer of a revolutionary new APP takes sides in the Microsoft

236
00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:56.410
Aol war without promoting his own APP.
Um,
the email also includes this,

237
00:13:56.411 --> 00:13:59.310
this actual trace.
This is from the email because a,

238
00:13:59.320 --> 00:14:02.260
I don't have my notes from it anymore because those were confidential,

239
00:14:02.261 --> 00:14:04.410
but I can still have that.
Um,

240
00:14:04.510 --> 00:14:08.590
and if Phil bookings text and his name warrant suspicious enough,

241
00:14:08.800 --> 00:14:10.960
he'd also sent the message,
uh,

242
00:14:11.560 --> 00:14:13.930
from one of Microsoft's computers and a Microsoft Ip.

243
00:14:14.890 --> 00:14:18.640
The Ip address showed up in the email headers and Microsoft's digital

244
00:14:18.641 --> 00:14:21.980
fingerprints were all over the email.
Smith accused,

245
00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:24.460
Microsoft is sending the email and Microsoft fessed up.

246
00:14:24.490 --> 00:14:26.140
The news story that emerged,

247
00:14:26.141 --> 00:14:29.920
covered Microsoft's attempt to bad mouth AOL under a fake identity and easier

248
00:14:29.921 --> 00:14:31.840
sell than explaining the buffer overflow.

249
00:14:32.800 --> 00:14:36.400
People in various security forums ascertained that the buffer overflow is real

250
00:14:36.490 --> 00:14:40.180
and invade further against a AOL.
But the press wasn't paying attention.

251
00:14:40.510 --> 00:14:45.010
The buffer overflow persisted into several later versions of aols client a will

252
00:14:45.011 --> 00:14:48.010
never admitted a thing and the press never did understand it.

253
00:14:48.790 --> 00:14:53.630
So we gave up and I licked my wounds.
I joined the server team.
The,
uh,

254
00:14:53.750 --> 00:14:57.950
the larger lesson of the,
of the messenger war was that the workings of code,

255
00:14:57.951 --> 00:15:01.610
we're no longer a private matter known only to those steeped in the lore of

256
00:15:01.611 --> 00:15:02.091
computing.

257
00:15:02.091 --> 00:15:06.290
They were increasingly becoming public affairs that impacted national and even

258
00:15:06.291 --> 00:15:10.760
global events.
And you know,
certainly coming in the wake of Cambridge Analytica,

259
00:15:10.810 --> 00:15:14.980
um,
true more true than even when I read this,

260
00:15:15.760 --> 00:15:18.430
they were in,
um,
the chat wars were to me,

261
00:15:18.431 --> 00:15:21.800
a duel between a handful of people within two Gargantuan companies.

262
00:15:21.801 --> 00:15:26.360
And yet they became a national news story for a brief period.
Uh,
looking back,

263
00:15:26.390 --> 00:15:29.000
it was the first inkling I had that it wasn't just computers that were

264
00:15:29.001 --> 00:15:30.170
permeating our lives,

265
00:15:30.171 --> 00:15:34.400
but the code itself and yet few grasp codes function and its impact,

266
00:15:34.401 --> 00:15:36.050
something that is still true today.

267
00:15:36.320 --> 00:15:39.410
The ultimate outcome of the conflict resulted from buffer overflow,

268
00:15:39.411 --> 00:15:42.590
whose existence was never agreed upon,
um,

269
00:15:42.920 --> 00:15:45.080
because neither reporters nor the public understood it.

270
00:15:45.740 --> 00:15:47.660
So sometime after I left Microsoft,

271
00:15:47.661 --> 00:15:50.360
I met one of the AOL engineers who've worked against me.

272
00:15:50.990 --> 00:15:54.770
We had a huge laugh over it,
and I complimented him on the genius of the buffer,

273
00:15:54.771 --> 00:15:59.650
overrun and exploit even as I,
uh,
bemoan my loss.
It had been a great game.
I said,

274
00:15:59.651 --> 00:16:00.590
and he agreed.

275
00:16:00.860 --> 00:16:04.640
We are both dumb struck that we are still to a very small number of people who

276
00:16:04.641 --> 00:16:09.050
knew the real story after all these years.
So,
um,
that is,

277
00:16:09.080 --> 00:16:13.880
that's the buffer overflow story.
Um,
I'd like the second section.

278
00:16:13.970 --> 00:16:15.760
Uh,
I is,

279
00:16:16.640 --> 00:16:20.660
if you can hold your questions to the end a is going to read two more short

280
00:16:20.661 --> 00:16:24.950
segments that,
uh,
relate to,
well,
the fact that the book goes all over the place.

281
00:16:24.951 --> 00:16:29.510
Um,
how many of you know Dork pour fortress,
by the way?
Just a couple of,
okay.

282
00:16:29.511 --> 00:16:31.460
I'm not going to be speaking about that today,
although I did.

283
00:16:31.490 --> 00:16:32.990
I did think about talking about it,

284
00:16:32.991 --> 00:16:36.650
but I try to discuss that in the book because I think it's a good example of how

285
00:16:36.651 --> 00:16:40.770
computers can and cannot model the world.
So,
um,

286
00:16:40.920 --> 00:16:45.920
there's a section called a truth tellers and liars and begins with a Charles

287
00:16:46.280 --> 00:16:51.260
Sanders pierce quote,
all that logic warrants as a hope and not a belief.
So,

288
00:16:51.261 --> 00:16:51.561
uh,

289
00:16:51.561 --> 00:16:55.940
there's a type of puzzle made most famous by the logician Raymond Smulyan and by

290
00:16:55.941 --> 00:16:58.850
the movie labyrinth that involves liars and truth tellers.

291
00:16:59.810 --> 00:17:03.740
And how many of you know these sorts of lie or truth teller logic puzzles?
Yeah.

292
00:17:03.741 --> 00:17:06.860
Okay.
So let,
let's skip all,
let's get a little,
we'll just skip over that.

293
00:17:06.861 --> 00:17:09.950
Here's a,
I'll just give you a variant that I gave to my daughter.
Uh,

294
00:17:09.970 --> 00:17:13.400
let's say we've got two doors and behind one is a huge amount of money in behind

295
00:17:13.401 --> 00:17:17.700
the other as a shark.
Um,
I decided that the lady or the tiger was a bit,

296
00:17:17.730 --> 00:17:21.230
it's a bit of a relic from an earlier era.

297
00:17:21.231 --> 00:17:26.210
So I changed it to money or shark,
which I thought was very,
very contemporary.

298
00:17:26.240 --> 00:17:29.330
Okay.
So the writing on the doors on door one,
the shark isn't here.

299
00:17:29.360 --> 00:17:31.880
Door to both doors are lying.
Well,

300
00:17:31.910 --> 00:17:34.700
door to must be lying because it's impossible to truthfully say that you're a

301
00:17:34.701 --> 00:17:37.970
liar.
So door one must be true or else do our two would be telling the truth.

302
00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:41.570
The shark is behind door one and the money is behind door to,
I uh,

303
00:17:41.600 --> 00:17:45.450
compulsively work through hundreds of these as a kid.
And,
uh,
I was fortunate,

304
00:17:45.470 --> 00:17:48.590
my mother's stumbled on Smolins book,
Alison Puzzle Land.

305
00:17:48.620 --> 00:17:51.750
How many of you read Ellison puzzle land?
There's a call.

306
00:17:51.751 --> 00:17:53.840
I was going to say there's gotta be at least a couple.
Um,

307
00:17:54.300 --> 00:17:57.900
and that became my introduction to the field of boolean logic.
And lie or truth,

308
00:17:57.901 --> 00:18:00.290
Heller Polos and logical paradoxes.
Um,

309
00:18:00.670 --> 00:18:05.340
Smollens use of Lewis Carroll suited the truth teller puzzles since,
uh,
you know,

310
00:18:05.341 --> 00:18:10.170
Carol had been a logician himself and some of the puddles in these books grew

311
00:18:10.171 --> 00:18:14.130
extraordinarily ornate and requiring multiple levels of inference.
Uh,

312
00:18:14.340 --> 00:18:17.010
sometimes they didn't tell you what one or another person had said.

313
00:18:17.011 --> 00:18:21.330
Sometimes yes and no are replaced with nonsense words like ballon dog that meant

314
00:18:21.331 --> 00:18:21.871
yes or no,

315
00:18:21.871 --> 00:18:25.740
but you didn't know which there were even abstruse puddles that attempted to

316
00:18:25.741 --> 00:18:30.450
explain Kurt Girdles incompleteness theorem.
But,
uh,
it was above my head,

317
00:18:30.480 --> 00:18:35.430
uh,
at that age.
Uh,
uh,
but one puzzle genuinely irritated me.

318
00:18:35.460 --> 00:18:37.500
And this is a simplified version of it.

319
00:18:37.530 --> 00:18:41.400
So Amanda is trying to figure out which of two caskets contain a portrait.

320
00:18:41.970 --> 00:18:44.730
The first portrait we have,
the portrait is not in here.

321
00:18:45.150 --> 00:18:49.590
And a second casket said exactly one of these caskets is telling the truth.

322
00:18:49.591 --> 00:18:51.360
So where's the portrait?
Well,

323
00:18:51.361 --> 00:18:53.340
whether or not the second casket is telling the truth,

324
00:18:53.341 --> 00:18:56.170
the first casket must not be.
Um,

325
00:18:56.710 --> 00:19:00.540
cause it says the portrait is not in here either as a second casket is true.

326
00:19:00.541 --> 00:19:04.680
And the first casket is therefore false,
or the second casket is false.

327
00:19:04.681 --> 00:19:07.140
And thus the first casket casket must be false as well.

328
00:19:07.170 --> 00:19:10.080
Or else the second casket would be telling the truth in the puzzle.

329
00:19:10.100 --> 00:19:12.450
The men also figures the portrait is in the first casket.

330
00:19:12.540 --> 00:19:16.170
He opens it up and finds nothing.
The portraits in the second cascade,

331
00:19:16.450 --> 00:19:18.840
he early baffled.
And so as I,

332
00:19:18.960 --> 00:19:21.990
and the answer seemed indisputable and it was very simple puzzle.

333
00:19:22.020 --> 00:19:26.580
So here's what smelly and rather an explanation without any information given

334
00:19:26.581 --> 00:19:28.980
about the truth or falsity of any of these sentences,

335
00:19:28.981 --> 00:19:31.890
nor any information given about the relation of their truth,
values.

336
00:19:32.100 --> 00:19:35.340
The sentences could say anything and the object to be anywhere.
Good Heavens,

337
00:19:35.341 --> 00:19:38.310
I can take any number of caskets that I please and put an object in one of them

338
00:19:38.311 --> 00:19:40.230
and then write any inscriptions at all on the lids.

339
00:19:40.440 --> 00:19:44.280
And these sentences won't convey any information.
I felt cheated.

340
00:19:44.340 --> 00:19:47.580
I felt that smelly and had made an implicit promise that he would be providing

341
00:19:47.581 --> 00:19:49.320
logic puzzles that made sense.

342
00:19:49.920 --> 00:19:54.030
But I grudgingly observed the other puzzles explicitly claimed that the rules

343
00:19:54.031 --> 00:19:57.210
were being obeyed.
And in this puzzle,
there was no such guarantee.

344
00:19:57.870 --> 00:20:00.960
The lesson was that truth and falsity are not absolute,

345
00:20:00.961 --> 00:20:04.740
but relative to a context outside that context statements,

346
00:20:04.741 --> 00:20:08.460
loose sense and meaning.
Without the guarantee that rules are being followed,

347
00:20:08.461 --> 00:20:12.210
we can never be sure that our reasoning is valid and nowhere is that more true

348
00:20:12.211 --> 00:20:15.930
than in the logical and contextually isolated world of computers.

349
00:20:16.860 --> 00:20:20.990
So,
um,
from there I go on to talk about,
um,

350
00:20:21.600 --> 00:20:24.240
bits themselves.
So,
um,
you know,

351
00:20:24.670 --> 00:20:28.100
bits are commonly represented by,
uh,

352
00:20:29.020 --> 00:20:34.020
the degree of voltage on a transistor and there's nothing true or false on

353
00:20:35.821 --> 00:20:37.590
circuit boards containing transistors,

354
00:20:37.591 --> 00:20:41.580
the binaries between the voltage being on or off a office,

355
00:20:41.600 --> 00:20:45.210
and actually zero as a,
you made sure to say,
but,
um,

356
00:20:45.600 --> 00:20:48.490
and the binary isn't between true or,
or even zero in one.

357
00:20:48.491 --> 00:20:52.630
No one is actually interested in whether gates output a voltage signal except in

358
00:20:52.631 --> 00:20:55.330
as much as that signal represents something else.

359
00:20:55.900 --> 00:20:59.710
And what such signals represent in a computer is an abstract notion of logical

360
00:20:59.711 --> 00:21:04.330
truth and falsehood,
which is a notion imposed by us,
truth and falsehood.

361
00:21:04.331 --> 00:21:07.870
Our conceptions that we apply to the presence or absence of a signal at a

362
00:21:07.871 --> 00:21:10.960
particular point on a circuit board.
Um,

363
00:21:10.990 --> 00:21:14.990
the binary representation of truth is so ubiquitous that we chronically can

364
00:21:14.991 --> 00:21:19.900
plate you logical,
true,
false and computational one zero on off binaries.

365
00:21:20.320 --> 00:21:22.900
A programming language permits me to have a boolean variable,

366
00:21:22.901 --> 00:21:25.780
let's call it is this thing on which can be either true or false.

367
00:21:26.230 --> 00:21:28.990
And the simplest representation and most common representation,
uh,

368
00:21:28.991 --> 00:21:31.090
would be to use zero for falls and one for true.

369
00:21:31.600 --> 00:21:33.940
But what if with this numerical representation,

370
00:21:33.941 --> 00:21:37.030
we run across a two or some other number that's not zero or one,

371
00:21:37.480 --> 00:21:40.420
we could declare those numbers to be meaningless.
Neither true nor false,

372
00:21:40.421 --> 00:21:43.780
but we don't want a trinary logic in which they're not two,
but three options,

373
00:21:43.781 --> 00:21:45.640
true falls and meaningless.
So,

374
00:21:45.641 --> 00:21:50.020
and see the convention is that zero is false in any other numbers.
True.
Um,

375
00:21:50.350 --> 00:21:53.860
this representation appeals to our common convention of Equating Truth with

376
00:21:53.861 --> 00:21:56.860
existence.
False.
It is nothing.
Absence,
emptiness,

377
00:21:56.890 --> 00:22:01.120
zero truth is presence of validity,
existence,
anything other than zero,

378
00:22:01.270 --> 00:22:05.650
even a negative number.
Um,
for those of you who've used Microsoft's h results,

379
00:22:05.651 --> 00:22:10.090
you know,
that,
uh,
it's reversed in that way and zero is,
uh,
actually,
uh,

380
00:22:10.140 --> 00:22:13.870
the standard success results.
Uh,
something that,
uh,

381
00:22:13.930 --> 00:22:17.620
caused a lot of bugs when people just,
uh,
use,
uh,

382
00:22:17.830 --> 00:22:21.850
the not sign on h on h results thinking that they were binary results.

383
00:22:22.810 --> 00:22:25.160
A programmer is,
and I include myself in this,

384
00:22:25.161 --> 00:22:29.170
is condition to treat true and false as synonyms for one and zero respectively

385
00:22:29.560 --> 00:22:33.940
true and false become the two possible values for a single bit in a two bit

386
00:22:33.941 --> 00:22:37.360
system,
uh,
in it's to value system.

387
00:22:38.860 --> 00:22:42.670
These trues and falses remained a purely formal convention even though the words

388
00:22:42.671 --> 00:22:46.510
contain metaphysical weight within them.
If I write,
God exists equals true.

389
00:22:46.511 --> 00:22:48.700
That obviously doesn't cause God to exist,

390
00:22:48.730 --> 00:22:51.700
nor does it cause the computer to think or believe that God exists.

391
00:22:52.000 --> 00:22:55.420
All it does is set a signal somewhere deep in the recesses of a computer's

392
00:22:55.421 --> 00:22:56.254
memory.

393
00:22:56.380 --> 00:22:59.680
That line of code Harver suggest more than just the changing of signal on a

394
00:22:59.681 --> 00:23:04.000
circuit board.
Any meaning we assign to true and false,
uh,
besides,
uh,

395
00:23:04.001 --> 00:23:08.020
signals being on or off his interpretation.
If I say God exists,

396
00:23:08.021 --> 00:23:11.320
I am making a claim about the real world.
When a program contains a statement,

397
00:23:11.321 --> 00:23:16.060
God exists equal one,
it merely indicates the alteration of a signal.
Um,

398
00:23:16.180 --> 00:23:19.840
so computers don't understand the difference between true and false,

399
00:23:19.841 --> 00:23:21.850
nor do they understand what the concepts mean.

400
00:23:21.851 --> 00:23:25.690
And if a computer is to gain any grasp on truth,
it's we understand it.

401
00:23:25.720 --> 00:23:30.410
It will have to be someplace other than in its bits.
And um,

402
00:23:30.550 --> 00:23:35.230
another quote from Thomas Pynchon who claims truth,
truth abandons,

403
00:23:36.040 --> 00:23:38.480
and there's a little historical context.

404
00:23:38.890 --> 00:23:42.550
The history of logic has long wrestled with the problem with getting that true

405
00:23:42.551 --> 00:23:45.260
to mean more than one or on,
uh,

406
00:23:45.290 --> 00:23:48.110
the problem of getting true to say something about the world.

407
00:23:48.560 --> 00:23:50.930
The difficulty started long before computers.

408
00:23:50.931 --> 00:23:54.140
We may think that we can patently tell the difference between a true and a false

409
00:23:54.141 --> 00:23:57.470
statement.
But outside of logic puzzles penning down this distinction,

410
00:23:57.471 --> 00:24:01.880
proofs renders the vaccine to the point that both western philosophers like

411
00:24:01.881 --> 00:24:05.870
sexist empiric as an eastern philosophers like and the Guardian a question

412
00:24:05.871 --> 00:24:08.990
whether the truth of anything could be noon.
These concerns,

413
00:24:08.991 --> 00:24:12.410
which might seem like Philosophical Navel gazing became far more urgent.

414
00:24:12.411 --> 00:24:17.200
What's formal logic?
Enter the picture.
The Great Magician Alfred Tarkovsky,
uh,

415
00:24:17.300 --> 00:24:21.860
an influence on computer science and artificial intelligence coined convention t

416
00:24:21.861 --> 00:24:24.170
as a minimal criteria for the truth of the statement.

417
00:24:24.220 --> 00:24:28.040
And here are two examples of convention t I show how many of you know convention

418
00:24:28.041 --> 00:24:31.220
t not too many,
okay.
Logics not in these days.

419
00:24:31.550 --> 00:24:34.010
All is as you put a sentence in quotes like the sky is blue,

420
00:24:34.310 --> 00:24:37.430
the sky is blue is true.
If and only if the sky is blue,

421
00:24:38.090 --> 00:24:41.510
I'm a jelly doughnut is true if,
and only if I'm a jelly donut.

422
00:24:42.200 --> 00:24:45.710
And a great deal of philosophical ink has been spilled on convention t.

423
00:24:45.711 --> 00:24:46.740
But I think,
uh,

424
00:24:46.820 --> 00:24:49.550
most people will agree that this criteria is not especially helpful as a

425
00:24:49.551 --> 00:24:52.250
practical guide to determining the truth of a statement.

426
00:24:52.820 --> 00:24:57.820
And yet we may even despair it how little progress convention t seems to make

427
00:24:58.010 --> 00:25:03.010
over Aristotle's definition of over 2000 years ago to say of what it is to say

428
00:25:04.041 --> 00:25:07.910
of what is that it is not,
or of what is not.
That it is,

429
00:25:07.970 --> 00:25:12.950
is false while at to say of what it is that it is and of what is not.

430
00:25:12.950 --> 00:25:17.710
That it is not.
It's true.
Not so helpful.
Okay.
Yeah,

431
00:25:17.840 --> 00:25:19.550
but you know,
whatever truth may be,

432
00:25:19.551 --> 00:25:22.340
we can conclude that in order to interact well with the world,

433
00:25:22.341 --> 00:25:26.630
computers must be able to distinguish between true and false in the same way as

434
00:25:26.631 --> 00:25:29.310
humans do.
The inadequacies of logic,

435
00:25:29.311 --> 00:25:32.260
tons of logicians attempts to collapse the,
uh,

436
00:25:32.840 --> 00:25:36.440
difference between a logical truth in a worldly truth have been made all too

437
00:25:36.441 --> 00:25:38.120
clear in the computing age.

438
00:25:38.480 --> 00:25:42.470
The mathematician and phenomenologists Jean Carlo Rhoda put this bluntly.

439
00:25:43.550 --> 00:25:46.850
Mathematicians are therefore mystified by the spectacle of philosophers

440
00:25:46.851 --> 00:25:50.630
pretending to reinject philosophical sense into the language of mathematical

441
00:25:50.631 --> 00:25:51.464
logic.

442
00:25:51.500 --> 00:25:55.760
The fake philosophical terminology of mathematical logic has misled philosophers

443
00:25:55.761 --> 00:25:58.520
into believing that mathematical logic deals with the truth and the

444
00:25:58.521 --> 00:26:01.250
philosophical sense.
But this is a mistake.

445
00:26:01.280 --> 00:26:04.910
Mathematical logic deals not with the truth,
but only with the game of truth.

446
00:26:05.150 --> 00:26:09.050
The snobbish symbol dropping found nowadays and philosophical papers raises

447
00:26:09.051 --> 00:26:13.400
eyebrows among mathematicians like someone paying his grocery bill with monopoly

448
00:26:13.401 --> 00:26:17.000
money.
Um,
Rhoda hear echoes Plato's,

449
00:26:17.001 --> 00:26:20.030
who was one of the first to find that truth as a practical matter,

450
00:26:20.060 --> 00:26:25.040
a matter of action rather than a pure theoretical,
uh,
abstraction.

451
00:26:25.530 --> 00:26:27.380
Uh,
and Paul Friedlander summary.

452
00:26:27.381 --> 00:26:32.090
A truth in Plato system is always both reality of being an correctness of

453
00:26:32.091 --> 00:26:35.990
apprehension and assertion.
Or in William James his words,

454
00:26:36.260 --> 00:26:40.220
truth happens to an idea.
It becomes true is made true by events.

455
00:26:40.700 --> 00:26:44.040
The troublesome gap is not between logic and language.
Between logic

456
00:26:44.040 --> 00:26:47.700
<v 1>and reality.
Symbols improves,
cannot close that gap on their own.</v>

457
00:26:49.290 --> 00:26:53.250
Three quotes.
One torn Adams is actually the author of two our fortress.

458
00:26:53.670 --> 00:26:56.040
You activate bugs and little parts of the code from eight,

459
00:26:56.041 --> 00:26:59.250
six years ago where you did just didn't balance the numbers because it didn't

460
00:26:59.251 --> 00:27:02.640
matter.
And the great computer scientist,
Alan Perlis,

461
00:27:02.641 --> 00:27:06.180
every program is a part of some other program and rarely fits something that

462
00:27:06.810 --> 00:27:11.670
everyone in this room I'm sure already knows.
And finally,
this is my daughter.

463
00:27:11.820 --> 00:27:14.160
Uh,
and this is something she,
this is a song she wrote,

464
00:27:14.730 --> 00:27:18.210
which I think sums it up better than me and errors can happen to you and

465
00:27:18.211 --> 00:27:22.140
computers because you are a computer.
Go and do it.
Program yourself,
just do it,

466
00:27:22.440 --> 00:27:25.950
explore your toes,
explore your nose,
explore everything you have NGOs.

467
00:27:26.190 --> 00:27:28.380
And if you don't want to do that,
you can't even live,

468
00:27:28.410 --> 00:27:31.890
not even houses because houses are us.
All right.

469
00:27:31.980 --> 00:27:35.880
That is what I want it to end on.
Thank you.

470
00:27:39.630 --> 00:27:40.463
I've thought a lot,

471
00:27:40.660 --> 00:27:44.200
<v 2>uh,
in my life about how,
um,</v>

472
00:27:44.410 --> 00:27:47.770
a deep understanding of computer science shapes my worldview and makes me think

473
00:27:47.771 --> 00:27:49.780
of the world and computational terms.

474
00:27:50.310 --> 00:27:53.590
And at the same time I've thought a lot about how,

475
00:27:55.000 --> 00:27:57.970
kind of similarly to what you were saying,
that that's insufficient to,

476
00:27:57.980 --> 00:28:02.980
to kind of bridge the gap between conscious reality or reality in general.

477
00:28:03.641 --> 00:28:08.380
And you know,
physics and math and all of that.
And I feel like in many ways,

478
00:28:08.630 --> 00:28:09.400
um,

479
00:28:09.400 --> 00:28:13.990
this computational way of thinking about the world is extremely useful and at

480
00:28:13.991 --> 00:28:17.650
the same time very clouding because it makes us overreach.

481
00:28:17.651 --> 00:28:20.920
And the way that you were alluding to in your last piece,
um,

482
00:28:20.950 --> 00:28:23.410
I was just wondering whether you could elaborate on your thoughts on that.

483
00:28:23.640 --> 00:28:26.880
<v 1>Yeah.
I mean,
this is something that I could speak about because I'm here,</v>

484
00:28:26.881 --> 00:28:31.470
which is that one of the strangest things was that as a software engineer,

485
00:28:31.500 --> 00:28:35.250
I felt like I was surrounded by people who thought it was enough.
I thought,

486
00:28:35.251 --> 00:28:39.210
there must be something wrong with me because everybody else seems so definite.

487
00:28:39.270 --> 00:28:42.870
I feel like it's just not working for me.
And honestly,

488
00:28:42.871 --> 00:28:47.871
a large part of the book is me trying to elaborate on why I was so dissatisfied

489
00:28:49.651 --> 00:28:52.620
with it,
which is one of the reasons why I don't,
you know,

490
00:28:52.740 --> 00:28:56.550
program full time anymore.
And you know,
I had been,

491
00:28:56.640 --> 00:29:01.640
I was a lit geek from a young age and I liked some of the,

492
00:29:02.040 --> 00:29:05.580
uh,
some of the formal,
uh,

493
00:29:05.790 --> 00:29:10.650
experimental books like,
uh,
like,
uh,
there's a French author,

494
00:29:10.651 --> 00:29:14.280
George Correc,
uh,
who wrote a book called life a user's manual,

495
00:29:14.310 --> 00:29:17.410
which is Donald [inaudible] favorite novel.
Um,

496
00:29:17.460 --> 00:29:21.690
and everything is sort of mathematically structured by all sorts of formal

497
00:29:21.691 --> 00:29:24.730
mechanisms and it's beautiful.
Um,

498
00:29:25.620 --> 00:29:30.370
and I found out actually in researching the book that,
um,
can,
uh,

499
00:29:30.410 --> 00:29:35.040
correct had been writing another project in which he needed a 12 by 12 Greco

500
00:29:35.041 --> 00:29:38.010
Latin square in the late sixties.

501
00:29:38.040 --> 00:29:43.040
And there had been a paper written on computation lead them because he couldn't,

502
00:29:43.570 --> 00:29:44.890
he couldn't make one by hand.

503
00:29:44.920 --> 00:29:49.850
And I think that was the Euclid or oiler who thought that there didn't exist

504
00:29:49.870 --> 00:29:54.190
even exist.
Greco Latin squares beyond a certain single digit size.

505
00:29:54.550 --> 00:29:57.730
Um,
but someone had written a paper on computationally generating them and the

506
00:29:57.731 --> 00:30:02.470
coauthor was Donald canoes.
So correct.
Wrote to canoes back in the days before.

507
00:30:02.710 --> 00:30:07.710
Knuth was quite the household name that he is today and got a two 12 by 12

508
00:30:08.891 --> 00:30:09.341
squares.

509
00:30:09.341 --> 00:30:14.341
So I love that point of connection and that I think that was one of the things

510
00:30:14.681 --> 00:30:18.490
that helped,
um,
keep me going and thinking,
okay,
there is,

511
00:30:18.520 --> 00:30:23.520
there is room to try to merge these two approaches because for many years I did

512
00:30:23.531 --> 00:30:27.070
feel like my mind was on two parallel tracks because I was doing some literature

513
00:30:27.071 --> 00:30:29.860
stuff in the background and then,
and then I was,

514
00:30:30.370 --> 00:30:33.660
this was my job and I did and I enjoyed it a lot.
But,

515
00:30:33.700 --> 00:30:38.020
but each one I think felt incomplete and I didn't,

516
00:30:38.470 --> 00:30:42.100
I couldn't see how to,
to sort of draw them together in any way.

517
00:30:42.101 --> 00:30:46.900
And for many years I did seem to be quite separate pieces because a lot of the

518
00:30:47.080 --> 00:30:51.070
literature and philosophy I studied was resolutely non quantitative and even

519
00:30:51.110 --> 00:30:53.410
non-logical.
Um,

520
00:30:53.830 --> 00:30:56.260
and as Giancarlo Rhoda points out,

521
00:30:56.261 --> 00:31:00.550
the attempts to integrate them were very ham fisted.
Um,

522
00:31:01.060 --> 00:31:03.790
there's,
and that,
that continues even to this day.

523
00:31:03.791 --> 00:31:08.791
One of the things I'm working on now is a Shakespearian authorship attribution

524
00:31:08.831 --> 00:31:12.550
using machine learning methods.
And,
um,
it's not,

525
00:31:12.580 --> 00:31:16.710
this is basically the plot of t statistics of words mapped against a

526
00:31:16.750 --> 00:31:20.680
frequencies.
And because these machine learning models,
uh,

527
00:31:20.780 --> 00:31:24.730
these were using decision trees,
random forests and um,

528
00:31:25.240 --> 00:31:28.030
a method called near a shrunken centroid.
Uh,

529
00:31:28.031 --> 00:31:32.290
but because of the models were all opaque,
um,
uh,
the,

530
00:31:32.380 --> 00:31:37.300
the internal results of the decision trees weren't presented.
Uh,
uh,

531
00:31:37.420 --> 00:31:40.000
I had to re the models of part to sort of figure out,
okay,

532
00:31:40.001 --> 00:31:42.130
actually how is this batch of Veshan being made?

533
00:31:42.131 --> 00:31:45.730
And seems like they were just being made on the basis of a handful,

534
00:31:46.000 --> 00:31:47.950
a very popular words like,

535
00:31:48.070 --> 00:31:52.930
and is used very frequently by authors who weren't Shakespeare and is not used

536
00:31:52.931 --> 00:31:57.850
very frequently by Shakespeare comparatively.
Yeah.
On a consistent basis.
Um,

537
00:31:58.360 --> 00:32:00.700
but you know,
if you don't actually have this breakdown,

538
00:32:00.701 --> 00:32:03.400
it can look very impressive.
So,
um,

539
00:32:04.570 --> 00:32:09.010
I think there's still a lack of good understanding as far as,

540
00:32:09.070 --> 00:32:12.040
as far as how you draw these things together.

541
00:32:12.041 --> 00:32:14.080
And part of that is because of the,

542
00:32:14.290 --> 00:32:19.060
the problems with semantic understanding that that computer is still have,

543
00:32:19.061 --> 00:32:23.320
I was always something of a skeptic when it came to a semantic AI,

544
00:32:23.321 --> 00:32:24.580
good old fashioned AI.

545
00:32:24.581 --> 00:32:28.840
And I guess I felt a little vindicated now that the much,

546
00:32:29.290 --> 00:32:30.240
uh,
the,

547
00:32:30.241 --> 00:32:34.390
the neural nets and,

548
00:32:34.480 --> 00:32:36.360
and other,
um,

549
00:32:37.130 --> 00:32:41.780
supervised learning tech sub symbolic techniques where sort of Poo pooed in the

550
00:32:41.781 --> 00:32:44.480
late 20th century and the Mid 20th Century in particular.

551
00:32:44.870 --> 00:32:46.520
But once you have enough data,

552
00:32:47.180 --> 00:32:51.320
suddenly they go way past anything that's symbolic AI has accomplished.

553
00:32:52.130 --> 00:32:53.870
So that's sort of a rambling answer.

554
00:32:53.871 --> 00:32:57.680
And I guess the short answer is that is that I treated at great length.

555
00:33:00.140 --> 00:33:05.080
Um,
anyone else like to ask anything whatsoever.
That's it.

556
00:33:05.260 --> 00:33:06.140
<v 3>They're two weeks empty.</v>

557
00:33:06.150 --> 00:33:10.310
You read one of them was very narrative and the other one was very,
uh,

558
00:33:11.950 --> 00:33:15.560
uh,
expos expository and like,

559
00:33:15.670 --> 00:33:20.050
what's the balance that you were trying to strike a and like what does the book

560
00:33:20.051 --> 00:33:24.460
like?
Is it,
uh,
a lot of the narrative structure?
Is it a lot of exposition?

561
00:33:24.461 --> 00:33:26.080
Do you like munge them together?

562
00:33:26.490 --> 00:33:31.470
<v 1>Yeah,
well,
hopefully helpful.
Hopefully they,
they,
I,
I skipped over the transition.</v>

563
00:33:31.500 --> 00:33:35.700
Um,
I tried to have it be both.
I mean,
I was encouraged,

564
00:33:36.180 --> 00:33:39.990
so it's an eye,
I'm naturally sort of a top down writers.

565
00:33:40.020 --> 00:33:42.600
So if I just gone at it,
it might,

566
00:33:42.601 --> 00:33:46.770
it might have been more directly philosophical,
but,
um,

567
00:33:47.160 --> 00:33:51.060
but a lot of people said,
no,
no,
no,
David,
you should make it more personal.

568
00:33:51.090 --> 00:33:54.270
And some of the stories are good,
but I tried to,

569
00:33:54.330 --> 00:33:57.420
but there's plenty of the parts of my life that I left out because I thought

570
00:33:57.421 --> 00:33:59.190
they were completely boring or irrelevant.

571
00:33:59.191 --> 00:34:03.960
So to the extent that I talk about my life,
it is always in the service of these,

572
00:34:04.050 --> 00:34:06.980
of,
of the larger points.
And uh,

573
00:34:07.090 --> 00:34:11.040
the balance is I don't,
um,

574
00:34:11.310 --> 00:34:14.790
it's hard to say.
I got,
I got,
I dunno what the balances would you say it's,

575
00:34:14.850 --> 00:34:19.350
is it 50,
50?
I guess my point though is that,
you know,

576
00:34:19.351 --> 00:34:21.780
having read books of both sorts,

577
00:34:21.781 --> 00:34:26.640
I think that you actually do need both pieces that,
um,
I actually,

578
00:34:26.670 --> 00:34:27.120
I,

579
00:34:27.120 --> 00:34:32.120
after after many years looking at politics but also arguments of other forms,

580
00:34:33.270 --> 00:34:37.110
it does seem that stories are actually better at convincing people then,

581
00:34:37.140 --> 00:34:38.820
then arguments per se.

582
00:34:38.940 --> 00:34:42.380
And so crafting a narrative story that,

583
00:34:42.500 --> 00:34:46.980
that illustrates a point in a more concrete and visceral way can actually be

584
00:34:46.981 --> 00:34:48.750
more effective than,
you know,

585
00:34:48.751 --> 00:34:53.550
a deductive argument in which you argued from first principles because there's

586
00:34:53.551 --> 00:34:58.551
usually some assumption made in there or some prior if you're basing a that if

587
00:34:59.131 --> 00:35:02.940
you don't agree on,
um,
you'll just say nine,
I know this is completely,

588
00:35:03.090 --> 00:35:06.540
this is completely invalid.
I'm not going to follow it,
but you know,

589
00:35:06.600 --> 00:35:11.580
you got a story and the threat of narrative is carrying you through.
Um,

590
00:35:12.230 --> 00:35:15.810
that's sort of my thinking about it.
Hi.

591
00:35:16.300 --> 00:35:19.060
<v 4>I was just wondering if I could ask you about your process writing this book.</v>

592
00:35:19.210 --> 00:35:22.540
I know you said in the Q and a how like you ended up finding narrative themes

593
00:35:22.541 --> 00:35:25.360
that you might not have attended initially.
Like how,

594
00:35:25.480 --> 00:35:29.740
how is the process and dinner?
Oh my God,
you read,
you read the Q and a.
My God.

595
00:35:29.741 --> 00:35:30.120
Okay.

596
00:35:30.120 --> 00:35:34.160
<v 1>Well,
um,
oh boy.
Um,
let me,
let me say something that you,</v>

597
00:35:34.230 --> 00:35:39.060
that I haven't already
process.

598
00:35:39.150 --> 00:35:42.450
Um,
well actually to return to the previous question,

599
00:35:42.460 --> 00:35:46.860
I did start off by writing some pretty theoretical stuff and I think my editor

600
00:35:46.861 --> 00:35:50.310
sort of reacted with harder saying you get,
there was an entire,

601
00:35:51.570 --> 00:35:55.560
there's an entire,
back in the day I did compiler research.

602
00:35:55.561 --> 00:35:59.040
I loved working on compilers because it was like,
it's like,
oh,

603
00:35:59.041 --> 00:36:02.690
it puts everything together.
And,
um,

604
00:36:02.790 --> 00:36:07.350
I had a chapter on compilers and compilers as illustrating the structure of

605
00:36:07.620 --> 00:36:11.720
abstraction layers and computers.
That chapter got a,

606
00:36:11.760 --> 00:36:15.720
and it got replaced with a chapter on,
uh,
my daughter.
Um,

607
00:36:16.290 --> 00:36:20.610
and you know,
uh,
what can I say?

608
00:36:20.611 --> 00:36:25.130
Maybe it will go onto the next book.
Uh,
but,
uh,
so it,
it was,

609
00:36:25.140 --> 00:36:29.540
it wasn't matter of approximation and it was a way of,
you know,

610
00:36:29.650 --> 00:36:33.390
I had some existing pieces that I'd written.
Um,

611
00:36:33.630 --> 00:36:38.630
there's one in particular called the stupidity of computers for n plus one that,

612
00:36:39.540 --> 00:36:41.820
that I think did provide the germ for this.

613
00:36:41.821 --> 00:36:46.821
And what I set out wanting to do was to write something that wasn't necessarily

614
00:36:49.051 --> 00:36:52.290
for,
um,
a technical audience,

615
00:36:52.380 --> 00:36:55.230
although I tried very hard to make it so that a tech,

616
00:36:55.260 --> 00:36:59.370
someone technical would read it and say,
okay,
this person,

617
00:36:59.730 --> 00:37:03.450
this person speaks my language.
Because whenever I,

618
00:37:03.570 --> 00:37:05.460
whenever I had written for various venues,

619
00:37:05.790 --> 00:37:09.240
I would often speak to a software engineer there and they'd say,
Oh my God,

620
00:37:09.241 --> 00:37:10.400
I'm so glad you're writing for us.

621
00:37:10.410 --> 00:37:14.010
You actually understand if he hears that it's happened enough that I was like,

622
00:37:14.011 --> 00:37:18.240
okay,
there's,
there's a,
there's,
there's a gap here in terms of,
you know,

623
00:37:18.300 --> 00:37:23.300
people do not want to read another abstract critique of how the,

624
00:37:25.291 --> 00:37:26.130
the,

625
00:37:26.160 --> 00:37:31.160
the postmodern structure of computation is altering the nature of subjectivity

626
00:37:33.811 --> 00:37:38.620
in the,
in the postmodern age.
You know,
something like that.
Uh,
that,

627
00:37:38.700 --> 00:37:43.700
that being able to talk about this in which the particulars of the computer

628
00:37:44.401 --> 00:37:45.720
science matter is,

629
00:37:45.721 --> 00:37:50.160
I think something that actually is very useful and helpful.

630
00:37:50.220 --> 00:37:53.310
And so I try,

631
00:37:53.370 --> 00:37:58.140
I wanted to sort of communicate that tool set as well as some greater

632
00:37:58.141 --> 00:38:01.580
reflections on that tool set.
Things that I didn't know when I said even,

633
00:38:01.600 --> 00:38:06.090
you know,
in college but sort of had come to from thinking about them.
Um,

634
00:38:06.500 --> 00:38:09.530
I was like,
I was,
I was a columnist for some,
for,

635
00:38:09.720 --> 00:38:13.050
for slate for some years and one of these,
shockingly,

636
00:38:13.110 --> 00:38:14.520
while there were two column,

637
00:38:14.670 --> 00:38:19.670
actually there were three columns that I wrote that were incredibly surprisingly

638
00:38:19.891 --> 00:38:24.390
popular.
One was on the amazing kids' game robot Odyssey.

639
00:38:24.480 --> 00:38:28.980
How many people here ever played robot odyssey the hardest computer game?
It was,

640
00:38:28.981 --> 00:38:33.300
it was,
you had to,
you had to use logic gates to program robots.

641
00:38:33.300 --> 00:38:35.860
This was made for the apple two in like 1984.

642
00:38:35.890 --> 00:38:38.440
It is the hardest computer game I ever played.

643
00:38:38.441 --> 00:38:43.180
I didn't solve it until I was in college because that's what it asks you to do

644
00:38:43.181 --> 00:38:43.811
with logic.

645
00:38:43.811 --> 00:38:48.811
Gates is so damn abstract and I didn't possess those skills back then.

646
00:38:50.020 --> 00:38:53.110
That one was a huge hit a piece on Rokos.

647
00:38:53.111 --> 00:38:56.950
Basilisk was a huge shed because everybody loves Rokos bassline that's going,

648
00:38:56.951 --> 00:38:59.170
if you don't know about Roku as pastoralists,
you should look it up.

649
00:38:59.860 --> 00:39:04.690
And the third one was about Vichtenstein and philosophy of language and how it

650
00:39:04.691 --> 00:39:08.200
related to computer science and how it had helped me understand some of the

651
00:39:08.201 --> 00:39:10.150
things I was I was talking about.

652
00:39:10.240 --> 00:39:14.200
And so in some ways those three pieces,
uh,

653
00:39:14.590 --> 00:39:17.140
understanding that you know,
computers,

654
00:39:17.141 --> 00:39:22.090
we're now touching everyday life and that the best way of understanding this was

655
00:39:22.091 --> 00:39:27.091
to both have a grasp of bits in the structures of computing as well as the

656
00:39:27.551 --> 00:39:29.480
larger picture of,
you know,

657
00:39:29.490 --> 00:39:33.850
what they meant in terms of everyday living was something that I wanted to

658
00:39:33.851 --> 00:39:34.391
communicate it.

659
00:39:34.391 --> 00:39:38.110
And then I thought I could hopefully have something useful to contribute on.

660
00:39:38.460 --> 00:39:41.770
I don't know.
Does that answer your question?
Thanks for reading the Q and.
A.

661
00:39:41.771 --> 00:39:44.770
I think I also said that it was the hardest thing I'd ever done and I still

662
00:39:44.771 --> 00:39:48.760
agree with that.
It was,
it wasn't,
it was not,
uh,
writing is hard.

663
00:39:48.790 --> 00:39:53.550
I don't recommend it to anyone who absolutely doesn't need to do it.
Uh,

664
00:39:53.740 --> 00:39:54.573
yeah.

665
00:39:54.590 --> 00:39:58.160
<v 5>Hi,
thanks for coming.
I look forward to reading the book.
Thank you.
So,</v>

666
00:39:58.161 --> 00:39:59.270
I don't know if you answered this in the book,

667
00:39:59.271 --> 00:40:04.271
but there's been a lot of talk last few years about teaching computational

668
00:40:04.341 --> 00:40:07.700
thinking to more and more people are more simplistically teaching programming to

669
00:40:07.701 --> 00:40:10.100
everyone.
And I'm curious what you think,

670
00:40:10.101 --> 00:40:13.940
whether it is this is a good thing or is it being overhyped?

671
00:40:14.970 --> 00:40:15.120
I

672
00:40:15.120 --> 00:40:18.000
<v 1>mean I guess I guess it can be both.
There's always a height,
you know,</v>

673
00:40:18.001 --> 00:40:20.250
there's always hyper round something or other,
it's like,
yeah,

674
00:40:20.251 --> 00:40:21.400
you can say to some extent,
oh,

675
00:40:21.401 --> 00:40:25.080
is our team is teaching kids about big data and you know,

676
00:40:25.140 --> 00:40:29.250
a good thing are overhyped well,
yes it's good to know about those things,

677
00:40:29.251 --> 00:40:32.160
but the words big data may make you think,

678
00:40:32.180 --> 00:40:36.840
oh well let's not teach it like that.
And I think that,
I think,

679
00:40:37.200 --> 00:40:38.033
I think,

680
00:40:38.190 --> 00:40:42.960
I think everyone can certainly benefit from knowing how code works just in the

681
00:40:42.961 --> 00:40:43.980
way that I think they're going.

682
00:40:44.040 --> 00:40:48.600
People should can benefit from knowing a bit about how machine learning models

683
00:40:48.601 --> 00:40:52.290
work and how they can and can't what they can and can't do.

684
00:40:52.890 --> 00:40:56.970
Um,
at the same time,
you know,

685
00:40:56.971 --> 00:40:58.770
marketing it as,
oh,

686
00:40:58.771 --> 00:41:02.940
this is going to be of practical usage to you and you know,

687
00:41:02.941 --> 00:41:04.980
you should definitely become a programmer or something like that.

688
00:41:05.030 --> 00:41:06.240
I don't think it's necessary.

689
00:41:06.241 --> 00:41:09.870
I think that it would be better to propose this as yes,

690
00:41:09.871 --> 00:41:14.871
this is fundamental knowledge in the same way that mathematics is logic.

691
00:41:15.061 --> 00:41:16.620
Having some base,

692
00:41:16.621 --> 00:41:20.220
even theoretical appreciation of what an algorithm is,

693
00:41:20.221 --> 00:41:21.750
how an algorithm can work.

694
00:41:22.230 --> 00:41:25.650
Maybe this is because I found this stuff really interesting.
I don't know.

695
00:41:25.651 --> 00:41:28.770
We recently picked up a book for my seven year old,

696
00:41:29.030 --> 00:41:33.000
a mathematics book for a seven year old that was recommended to us by someone

697
00:41:33.110 --> 00:41:35.810
other and they said,
yeah,
yeah,
this is great for like,
you know,

698
00:41:35.811 --> 00:41:38.270
really getting your kid into math.
And it was,

699
00:41:38.660 --> 00:41:42.200
it was written in Latech and I said,
okay,
good sign.
Um,

700
00:41:42.530 --> 00:41:44.420
but I started reading the problem.
It's like,
oh my God,

701
00:41:44.421 --> 00:41:48.650
this group theory for seven year olds.
I was,
I was like,
this is insane.

702
00:41:49.010 --> 00:41:51.830
I like it.
It was a very impressive,
but I literally,

703
00:41:52.480 --> 00:41:57.480
I'm the number of kids who can absorb this level of abstraction because it was

704
00:41:58.131 --> 00:41:58.880
like,
okay,

705
00:41:58.880 --> 00:42:01.730
well let's say you have beads on a chain that alternate between these three

706
00:42:01.731 --> 00:42:04.820
types of beads.
What does the 493rd bead?

707
00:42:05.210 --> 00:42:10.100
It was like for a seven year old.
Uh,
I was like,
all right.
Um,

708
00:42:10.340 --> 00:42:13.940
so I think it's a good thing.
I think that unfortunately,

709
00:42:14.240 --> 00:42:17.510
especially Ed tech being the way that it is,
you know,

710
00:42:17.511 --> 00:42:20.840
there's reason to worry whether the right things are being taught.
You know,

711
00:42:20.870 --> 00:42:22.370
if you just go,
go,

712
00:42:22.550 --> 00:42:26.090
if you just teach people how to like design a clock and put it up on the screen,

713
00:42:26.091 --> 00:42:30.020
that's,
that's interest.
I mean,
it will get you some appreciation,
but um,

714
00:42:30.590 --> 00:42:33.330
and use.
But I think that,
uh,

715
00:42:33.590 --> 00:42:37.630
I think that putting into context can be useful as well.
Just as you know.

716
00:42:38.360 --> 00:42:39.193
I mean,

717
00:42:39.620 --> 00:42:44.620
it would be as if you only did like or arithmetic word problems in your entire

718
00:42:44.961 --> 00:42:48.410
time at school,
you know,
instead of going on to Algebra and calculus,

719
00:42:48.940 --> 00:42:51.450
I don't know,
does that answer your question?
Okay.

720
00:42:52.340 --> 00:42:54.650
<v 6>You mentioned,
uh,
like a fade.</v>

721
00:42:54.651 --> 00:42:58.990
I can logo a SnapVault ed before.
And I wonder,

722
00:42:59.060 --> 00:43:03.660
what do you think about like this educational programming and,

723
00:43:03.810 --> 00:43:08.350
uh,
we're going and,
uh,
uh,
what would it be?
The future of the,

724
00:43:08.351 --> 00:43:09.320
of the logo or

725
00:43:09.680 --> 00:43:10.910
<v 1>teaching?
No,
no.
I mean,</v>

726
00:43:11.300 --> 00:43:15.260
I look at scratch and I have such mixed feelings about it because on the one

727
00:43:15.261 --> 00:43:18.660
hand,
it's great to have,
you know,
the notion of,

728
00:43:19.080 --> 00:43:24.080
of imperative language and functional abstraction.

729
00:43:24.890 --> 00:43:27.260
Uh,
and,
but on the other hand,

730
00:43:27.261 --> 00:43:32.210
it's like they aren't talking about recursion,
you know,
where are the,
you know,

731
00:43:32.211 --> 00:43:36.260
we're,
we're,
we're,
uh,
uh,
uh,
uh,
that,

732
00:43:36.261 --> 00:43:40.780
that I,
I feel like to some extent there's some,

733
00:43:41.480 --> 00:43:44.960
I,
I do feel that you could introduce some of these concepts,

734
00:43:45.020 --> 00:43:48.590
some of the higher order concepts in a cool way earlier on.

735
00:43:48.591 --> 00:43:53.390
But at the same time,
I,
I,
uh,
you know,

736
00:43:53.420 --> 00:43:56.630
the fact that the kids are doing them as good and I've seen,
I mean,

737
00:43:56.631 --> 00:44:01.160
I've seen other computer games,
I've seen other like kids' games that,
that,

738
00:44:01.340 --> 00:44:05.090
that,
that work on similar principles.
Um,
but,

739
00:44:05.540 --> 00:44:08.830
uh,
I think,

740
00:44:10.480 --> 00:44:13.280
uh,
to some extent,
you know,

741
00:44:13.520 --> 00:44:16.940
it doesn't necessarily have to take the form of programming per say as it,

742
00:44:17.000 --> 00:44:22.000
as much as it is a certain form of algorithmic abstraction and then it doesn't

743
00:44:22.311 --> 00:44:26.910
necessarily require programming so much as,
you know,
learning the,

744
00:44:26.920 --> 00:44:31.230
the nature of how data structures and certain algorithms can,

745
00:44:31.231 --> 00:44:32.600
can fit together.
And I,

746
00:44:32.610 --> 00:44:36.720
I'm saying that vaguely because I'm just thinking back to the various things I

747
00:44:36.721 --> 00:44:40.440
did when I was a kid that they gave me and appreciation,
you know,

748
00:44:40.441 --> 00:44:45.180
I think truth teller in logic polls are great as well.
Uh,

749
00:44:45.900 --> 00:44:50.610
and there are probably other forms of puzzles that I haven't,
um,

750
00:44:51.720 --> 00:44:56.350
that,
uh,
that I'd never played.
That would be great as well.
And I think that,
um,

751
00:44:57.180 --> 00:44:58.590
while we're all here at Google,

752
00:44:58.591 --> 00:45:01.590
but if some of us worked on trying to figure out what those are,
that would be,

753
00:45:01.670 --> 00:45:04.050
that would be wonderful as well.
Um,

754
00:45:04.140 --> 00:45:06.630
there was a puzzle game I played recently called,
uh,

755
00:45:06.900 --> 00:45:09.510
Steven's sausage roll doing it.
Does anyone know it?

756
00:45:09.820 --> 00:45:13.830
It is the hardest puzzle game I've played in many in many years.

757
00:45:13.831 --> 00:45:18.270
And I felt that training my brain quite well.
Um,

758
00:45:18.810 --> 00:45:22.320
uh,
in terms of,
uh,
I mean it,
it's,

759
00:45:22.680 --> 00:45:26.790
you can see how it was very heavily influenced by abstract Algebra,

760
00:45:27.060 --> 00:45:31.890
but it translates those concepts into,
into app,

761
00:45:31.950 --> 00:45:36.390
into applications within this game so that you aren't doing,
you know,

762
00:45:36.420 --> 00:45:38.640
purely abstract exercises,

763
00:45:38.641 --> 00:45:41.580
but you're actually executing it in a vaguely algorithmic manner.

764
00:45:42.060 --> 00:45:45.440
So I hope there's more of that honestly.
Um,

765
00:45:45.450 --> 00:45:49.620
I think there's a lot of room for improvement.
Um,
uh,

766
00:45:49.770 --> 00:45:53.700
certainly,
you know,
I look at,
uh,
actually it's interesting,
you know,

767
00:45:53.730 --> 00:45:57.030
my daughter's learning chess and I feel like in some ways chest tutelage has

768
00:45:57.031 --> 00:45:57.864
been,

769
00:45:58.560 --> 00:46:02.130
has been developed very well because the levels of abstraction you treat and

770
00:46:02.330 --> 00:46:06.480
sort of go up that ladder like that.
And it's because you have such a,
uh,

771
00:46:06.870 --> 00:46:10.050
an established context that,
that it's helpful.

772
00:46:10.051 --> 00:46:14.100
So in some ways I would say that I'm learning chess may actually be better for

773
00:46:14.101 --> 00:46:19.080
you than learning scratch.
I Dunno.
And chess here really,
really gets better.

774
00:46:19.081 --> 00:46:23.490
I mean like he beats me in chest at this point.
Yeah.
I mean there's a real ally.

775
00:46:23.520 --> 00:46:26.340
You know what?
I was six years old and I had an apple,

776
00:46:26.341 --> 00:46:29.630
two e with amount of chrome moniker monitored,
but you know,
here you have,

777
00:46:29.650 --> 00:46:33.630
you can draw shapes and that was cool enough for me.
I mean,
and um,

778
00:46:33.810 --> 00:46:36.300
I have a short attention span and need lots of stimulation.

779
00:46:36.301 --> 00:46:39.270
So I don't think the kids would be,
would hate it today.

780
00:46:39.300 --> 00:46:43.230
Try to replace Gretsch with Janice crypt and explain like to my son,

781
00:46:43.500 --> 00:46:47.280
how'd you draw these shapes and with Java script.
Oh,
you're just torturing him.

782
00:46:51.150 --> 00:46:54.780
Sorry.
It didn't seem that interested.
If that's cause of javascript

783
00:46:56.320 --> 00:46:59.140
type python at least you know,
uh,

784
00:47:00.870 --> 00:47:04.780
or Apl,
maybe he'll like the cool little lake.
You know the symbols.
I don't know.

785
00:47:07.080 --> 00:47:10.200
Sorry.
I look,

786
00:47:10.350 --> 00:47:12.270
if I had been introduced to javascript when I was six,

787
00:47:12.271 --> 00:47:13.350
I probably wouldn't be appropriate.

788
00:47:17.090 --> 00:47:21.480
Um,
does someone else have a question back there?
Peter,

789
00:47:21.481 --> 00:47:22.620
you must have a question

790
00:47:25.030 --> 00:47:29.200
and give me a hard time on logic and reason.
Do I what were that?

791
00:47:29.201 --> 00:47:33.850
You put too much weight on logic and reason,
didn't I just criticize it?
Well,

792
00:47:35.770 --> 00:47:38.710
yes,
but there was a lot of,

793
00:47:38.750 --> 00:47:41.930
a lot of philosophy and logic in there.
I mean the,

794
00:47:41.931 --> 00:47:46.931
the background experience there is the discovery that winning an argument

795
00:47:47.201 --> 00:47:50.410
doesn't make you right.
Yeah.
So,
well,
I mean,

796
00:47:50.411 --> 00:47:52.660
to some extent I was hoping to play to this audience.

797
00:47:52.661 --> 00:47:56.910
I wouldn't have read that section to,
uh,
to,
to,
uh,

798
00:47:57.010 --> 00:47:58.540
to an audience of lit majors.

799
00:47:58.540 --> 00:48:03.310
But this is presumably what folks here do all the time.
And,
uh,

800
00:48:03.670 --> 00:48:06.970
you know,
maybe software for software engineers have changed,

801
00:48:06.971 --> 00:48:11.320
but I feel that the impulse to,
uh,

802
00:48:11.830 --> 00:48:16.810
to,
to quantify and regimen things logically is still pretty strong amongst,

803
00:48:16.840 --> 00:48:17.673
uh,

804
00:48:17.680 --> 00:48:22.000
software engineers and other sorts of engineers and scientists.

805
00:48:22.030 --> 00:48:25.090
And so I think it's worth exploring.

806
00:48:25.091 --> 00:48:30.091
And I think that the stuff I talk about still underpins a lot of,

807
00:48:30.550 --> 00:48:34.690
uh,
a lot of arguments,
I think.
And even if you look at,

808
00:48:35.500 --> 00:48:36.250
you can see it.

809
00:48:36.250 --> 00:48:40.510
I guess if I were talking to an audience of statisticians,

810
00:48:40.511 --> 00:48:43.530
I'd probably be talking about Bayesianism infrequent to us and I,

811
00:48:43.531 --> 00:48:45.400
and you could come up and ask me,

812
00:48:45.401 --> 00:48:48.580
do you think you place too much emphasis on statistics?
And I was like,
well,

813
00:48:48.581 --> 00:48:50.710
you know,
it's everywhere.

814
00:48:50.711 --> 00:48:54.110
So the world may place too much emphasis on it.
Uh,

815
00:48:54.270 --> 00:48:58.240
software engineers actually believe in truth in their programs.
No,
no.
I mean,

816
00:48:58.241 --> 00:49:01.350
that's,
what do I think software engineers believe?

817
00:49:01.450 --> 00:49:06.450
I think that software engineers have a tendency towards reifying contingent

818
00:49:07.601 --> 00:49:10.480
categories as,
uh,

819
00:49:10.570 --> 00:49:15.400
as literal and,
uh,
and permanent.

820
00:49:15.790 --> 00:49:18.970
Uh,
for example,
the,
these,
uh,
these,

821
00:49:19.000 --> 00:49:23.830
these four like personality tests,
you know,
I,
uh,
you know,

822
00:49:23.831 --> 00:49:27.850
people maybe people don't like,
uh,
many people don't go from Myers Briggs,

823
00:49:27.851 --> 00:49:28.600
but you know,

824
00:49:28.600 --> 00:49:33.160
apparently we subject a lot of people to classifying people into four colors,

825
00:49:33.161 --> 00:49:36.190
green,
blue,
gold,
and orange.
Uh,

826
00:49:36.730 --> 00:49:39.520
apparently most people turn out to be Greens.
Uh,

827
00:49:39.940 --> 00:49:44.620
so if this is something that,
you know,
we all take seriously here at Google,

828
00:49:44.740 --> 00:49:47.820
I would say,
well,
I know you don't take it seriously Peter,

829
00:49:47.830 --> 00:49:51.610
but would you argue that most people take it seriously here?

830
00:49:52.810 --> 00:49:56.400
Okay.
My experience was that video,
um,

831
00:49:59.440 --> 00:50:01.840
it's easy to,
to over over,

832
00:50:02.080 --> 00:50:06.520
wait what shows up on weird male threads or in fact any mail thread.
Right.

833
00:50:06.580 --> 00:50:10.120
This is just from talking.
I believe this was just talking to people.
I mean,

834
00:50:10.330 --> 00:50:11.520
I didn't read mail threads when I was,

835
00:50:11.620 --> 00:50:15.280
I can't seem to help address a statistical group.

836
00:50:15.281 --> 00:50:18.220
We would argue about your sampling procedures,
right?
We could,

837
00:50:18.221 --> 00:50:21.160
but don't you think you're putting too much emphasis on statistics?

838
00:50:23.800 --> 00:50:25.930
No,
I think that's the only way to truth.

839
00:50:26.990 --> 00:50:30.920
Well as so there you go.
Uh,
uh,

840
00:50:31.220 --> 00:50:35.170
perhaps overweighting the,
the,
the,
the logical truth.
No definition.

841
00:50:36.440 --> 00:50:39.770
I have what I think is a very relevant question.

842
00:50:40.020 --> 00:50:43.130
I was wondering if you could talk about what it's like to write for and be

843
00:50:43.131 --> 00:50:47.960
criticized by programmers on the Internet.
Uh,

844
00:50:48.500 --> 00:50:53.450
yeah.
I mean,
I'll be honest and say people were actually really nice,

845
00:50:53.451 --> 00:50:54.284
I think.

846
00:50:54.470 --> 00:50:59.470
And this is the sort of reinforce that that a lot of the feedback was,

847
00:50:59.630 --> 00:51:02.960
oh my God,
finally someone who knows about coding.

848
00:51:03.560 --> 00:51:05.360
So I would say if anything,

849
00:51:05.361 --> 00:51:10.361
I was spoiled because I think that there's not a lot of technical knowledge on

850
00:51:10.431 --> 00:51:14.990
display,
at least in the so called popular press or you know,
uh,

851
00:51:14.991 --> 00:51:19.170
that,
um,
that I wouldn't say I've gone,

852
00:51:19.440 --> 00:51:24.380
I wouldn't say I've gotten a lot of,
uh,
of flack.

853
00:51:24.380 --> 00:51:28.640
But in,
in general,
I think that
if anything,

854
00:51:28.820 --> 00:51:31.690
I detected that there was a certain frustration and I mean this is the

855
00:51:31.691 --> 00:51:35.750
frustration sort of getting writ large at this point because you have a larger

856
00:51:35.751 --> 00:51:36.740
cultural clash.

857
00:51:36.741 --> 00:51:40.790
And this is something that I've seen being involved in like the New York writing

858
00:51:40.791 --> 00:51:45.791
scene and how much resentment or at least loading her is towards the Silicon

859
00:51:47.360 --> 00:51:51.710
Valley and,
and,
and tech people of all stripes.

860
00:51:51.711 --> 00:51:56.711
And this can extend to an ontological critique that anyone in programming must

861
00:51:56.871 --> 00:52:01.160
therefore be a,
an awful evil positivist,
which again,

862
00:52:01.400 --> 00:52:05.330
yeah,
feed or you're right,
they aren't.
But you know,

863
00:52:05.360 --> 00:52:10.360
there are lots of big names who speak for technical companies who certainly

864
00:52:11.900 --> 00:52:15.050
qualify more on the positivists side of things.

865
00:52:15.410 --> 00:52:20.150
And there's a lot of anger.
There's a lot of unjustified or anger towards them,

866
00:52:20.840 --> 00:52:24.530
which I think,
which I think is based in ignorance.
I also think that,
you know,

867
00:52:24.531 --> 00:52:26.050
yes.
Uh,
the,
the,

868
00:52:26.060 --> 00:52:29.810
the worldview could do with some intelligent critiques rather than ignorant

869
00:52:29.811 --> 00:52:34.550
critiques that just really caused them to double down and think that,
that,
uh,

870
00:52:34.580 --> 00:52:36.370
that uh,
you know,

871
00:52:36.470 --> 00:52:40.010
maybe we should go back and go back to iron rand because she was,

872
00:52:40.250 --> 00:52:42.920
cause she was right after all.
Um,

873
00:52:47.300 --> 00:52:51.430
I dunno how,
how's that,
how's that for an answer?
Uh,

874
00:52:53.240 --> 00:52:57.470
I mean it's a culture clash and it really is.
Um,
but,

875
00:52:57.500 --> 00:53:01.730
and I guess the thing is,
is I have,
I have an affection for both sides,
I suppose,

876
00:53:01.731 --> 00:53:04.280
as well as frustration with,
um,

877
00:53:04.700 --> 00:53:09.700
perhaps close mindedness that that occurs of which I have my own,

878
00:53:09.990 --> 00:53:12.890
uh,
my own variance of it.
You know,

879
00:53:13.190 --> 00:53:16.850
am I going to sit here and tell you that you should reject Derrida?
Hell No.

880
00:53:17.420 --> 00:53:21.830
Am I going to tell you that you should sit here and read?
Uh,
um,

881
00:53:22.220 --> 00:53:26.900
I don't know.
Dennis DDA row.
Yes.
Yeah.

882
00:53:27.240 --> 00:53:29.130
Just stuff to be gained.
But unfortunately,

883
00:53:29.131 --> 00:53:31.350
what rises to the top isn't always the best stuff.

884
00:53:32.220 --> 00:53:34.380
You mentioned that writing is work hard,

885
00:53:34.381 --> 00:53:36.300
work any word and recommend it to anyone.

886
00:53:36.570 --> 00:53:41.400
So do plan to continue writing and will it,
will it be on the familiar topic?

887
00:53:41.730 --> 00:53:45.270
Yeah,
I have a problem.
Yeah.
I mean it's,
it's you,

888
00:53:45.360 --> 00:53:47.800
you do it if you can't do anything else.
I mean,

889
00:53:47.810 --> 00:53:49.680
there's a Thomas Mohn quote where he said,

890
00:53:50.040 --> 00:53:53.670
a writer as someone for whom writing is harder than it is for anyone else.

891
00:53:53.671 --> 00:53:57.030
And I don't think,
I don't know that that's true for all writers,

892
00:53:57.031 --> 00:54:00.450
but it's certainly true for me.
And,
um,
I just,

893
00:54:01.800 --> 00:54:02.880
you know,
it,
it's,

894
00:54:02.881 --> 00:54:07.881
it's scratching some itch and you try to do it so that you hopefully are serving

895
00:54:09.361 --> 00:54:11.750
some greater purpose with it.
But,
um,

896
00:54:12.150 --> 00:54:15.480
that's a sort of question that can make you very,
very self conscious in a hurry.

897
00:54:15.481 --> 00:54:19.170
But I do plan to continue it.
I'm writing a,
I'm writing a,

898
00:54:19.350 --> 00:54:24.330
a young adult novel right now to get a complete break from this because,
um,

899
00:54:24.870 --> 00:54:28.380
um,
I didn't want to write about myself anymore,
but yes,
I have,

900
00:54:28.410 --> 00:54:33.410
I have more to say about computers and hopefully that'll be,

901
00:54:33.840 --> 00:54:37.020
that'll,
that'll be in calming.
Uh,
in the short term,

902
00:54:37.890 --> 00:54:42.750
what is short term?
Uh,
oh boy.
Knowing I mean,
God,

903
00:54:42.980 --> 00:54:45.960
you know,
and life cycles of books are much slower.

904
00:54:45.961 --> 00:54:50.280
So it depends if a,
how next few years.
I hope,

905
00:54:50.490 --> 00:54:52.980
I hope,
uh,
sooner if,
uh,

906
00:54:52.981 --> 00:54:57.960
if the publishing industry decides to decides to speed up,
it's uh,
it's cycles.

907
00:54:57.961 --> 00:54:58.794
But,
uh,

908
00:54:59.250 --> 00:55:02.280
I mean there was like a year turnaround after finishing this before it actually

909
00:55:02.281 --> 00:55:06.500
like came out.
So it's,
uh,
I,
I do miss the,
the,

910
00:55:06.810 --> 00:55:11.340
the rapid release cycles of,
Hey,
I just called to this fixed,
let's push it out.

911
00:55:11.370 --> 00:55:15.090
All right,
good night.
Um,
if I could do that with a book,
that'd be great.

912
00:55:15.091 --> 00:55:15.990
That's why I still,
you know,

913
00:55:15.991 --> 00:55:19.590
I still blog sometimes just because be able to write something and actually put

914
00:55:19.591 --> 00:55:21.930
it out there for,
uh,

915
00:55:21.990 --> 00:55:24.840
for consumption the same day is amazing.

916
00:55:25.110 --> 00:55:27.420
And one of my most popular pieces in the last year,

917
00:55:27.421 --> 00:55:29.030
I actually went through that and I had,

918
00:55:29.340 --> 00:55:32.640
which was my explanation of the finale of twin peaks,
the return,

919
00:55:32.940 --> 00:55:34.890
which I wrote in a couple days post it.

920
00:55:35.190 --> 00:55:39.930
Apparently a lot of people really wanted answers because overnight I get like

921
00:55:40.080 --> 00:55:44.400
literally like 10,000 times more traffic than my little blog has ever seen

922
00:55:44.401 --> 00:55:45.234
before.

923
00:55:47.010 --> 00:55:48.920
<v 4>Watch like five packets.
I felt like</v>

924
00:55:51.560 --> 00:55:53.450
I didn't me,
but I'm just curious.

925
00:55:54.590 --> 00:55:57.230
<v 1>Um,
I mean,
what I always told people,
look,</v>

926
00:55:57.231 --> 00:55:59.750
if you're not enjoying it moment to moment,
don't watch it.
You want,

927
00:55:59.751 --> 00:56:03.950
it's not worth it.
But it's a,
but I,
at the end of it,
I did want to know more.

928
00:56:04.070 --> 00:56:07.940
So anyway,
thank you very much everybody.

929
00:56:08.600 --> 00:56:10.070
It's been great.
It's been fun.
