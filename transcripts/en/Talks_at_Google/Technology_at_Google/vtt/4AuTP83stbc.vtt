00:00:08.170 --> 00:00:11.630
Hi,
welcome to talks at Google and Cambridge,
Massachusetts.

2
00:00:12.310 --> 00:00:16.510
We're here to,
uh,
I'm very proud to,
to welcome David Mccauley,

3
00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:18.520
author of the,
the way things work.

4
00:00:18.970 --> 00:00:23.970
This is a book that I think many of us have a lot of affection for that deeply

5
00:00:24.161 --> 00:00:28.870
informative but also a lot of fun and whimsical.
Um,

6
00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:29.680
my,

7
00:00:29.680 --> 00:00:34.210
my son is in college now majoring in mechanical engineering and I like to think

8
00:00:34.211 --> 00:00:37.600
that a part of that is actually,
you know,
our experience with the,

9
00:00:37.660 --> 00:00:42.200
with the book when he was younger.
Um,
in any event,
uh,

10
00:00:42.250 --> 00:00:45.600
David Macaulay's certainly someone who needs no more further introduction.

11
00:00:45.601 --> 00:00:48.040
So without further ado,
please welcome David Mccauley.

12
00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:54.600
<v 2>Thank you.
Thank you.</v>

13
00:00:55.770 --> 00:01:00.750
<v 3>I put together some slides.
Basically you did trace for you the,</v>

14
00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:03.540
a little bit of the history of the way things work.

15
00:01:04.050 --> 00:01:06.990
It's a book that's been out now since 1988.

16
00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:13.040
No one is more surprised than I am that it's still out and that it in fact has

17
00:01:14.041 --> 00:01:17.660
been through a couple of revisions.
And,
um,

18
00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:22.260
it makes me feel good because when we started,

19
00:01:22.261 --> 00:01:25.050
I had no clue what was going to become of this book,

20
00:01:25.051 --> 00:01:27.170
how it was going to be received.
At.

21
00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:31.080
My biggest concern at the very beginning was the idea of working on a book,

22
00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:34.020
the 400 pages.
It was all about machines.

23
00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:37.290
It just seemed like an absurd task.

24
00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:42.060
And for somebody with my attention span every of challenge.

25
00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:47.780
So I was first asked to join the team and you can,

26
00:01:48.781 --> 00:01:52.710
you know,
I mean,
you know,
teams,
um,
if you guys don't know teams,

27
00:01:52.830 --> 00:01:54.570
I don't know who does.
Um,

28
00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:58.680
but obviously this book was put together by a team.

29
00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:03.300
Um,
I was the visual guy.
I was the,
uh,
the,
you know,
yeah.

30
00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:06.510
Author in my own right when it comes to books about architecture and so on,

31
00:02:06.690 --> 00:02:08.580
but not about technology.
Uh,

32
00:02:08.581 --> 00:02:12.300
Neil hardly who wrote all the technical text for the book,
um,

33
00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:16.400
became my teacher for,
you know,

34
00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:20.430
four years.
Um,
and then again in [inaudible] 98 when we did the second review,

35
00:02:20.460 --> 00:02:23.250
he would,
he would,
at first I went to London,

36
00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:27.570
which is where they were putting this thing together and spent five days and uh,

37
00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:32.310
did it four times to go for each of the four sections of the book.

38
00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:36.540
And we went through every machine and Neil basically told me everything he knows

39
00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:41.220
and I sketched while he was talking.

40
00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:45.360
And this is the only way I knew whether or not I was actually learning anything,

41
00:02:45.361 --> 00:02:48.300
whether I was really even listening to what he had to say.

42
00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:52.140
Because after 10 minutes of technical,
well,
no,
I exaggerate.

43
00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:55.890
After five minutes of technical talk,
I'm usually lost.

44
00:02:55.891 --> 00:02:59.950
My eyes have glazed over and I,
so I need the pencil in my hand.

45
00:02:59.951 --> 00:03:04.210
I need some tracing paper in front of me and they need to be in that process of

46
00:03:04.211 --> 00:03:09.211
trying to interpret what I'm hearing so that I can then turn it over to,

47
00:03:10.570 --> 00:03:14.380
uh,
to Neil and say,
is this,
this is where we're going?

48
00:03:14.381 --> 00:03:15.550
Is this what we're talking about here?

49
00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:20.760
And then I would come back and to the studio and attempt to reinterpret my

50
00:03:22.571 --> 00:03:26.650
interpretation so that it could be used to present what I had learned and not

51
00:03:26.651 --> 00:03:30.100
simply to record it,
but to present it in some sort of meaningful way.

52
00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:33.130
Once you're looking at here is this was done before me.

53
00:03:33.190 --> 00:03:38.190
This was done probably in 1982 or 1983 this was decays masterplan,

54
00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:41.983
um,

55
00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:47.070
in a very sketchy way of what they hope that the book would be things linked

56
00:03:47.071 --> 00:03:50.560
together in various ways that would make it fun to turn the pages that would

57
00:03:50.561 --> 00:03:55.561
ultimately though pass on information to the reader of the book about not only

58
00:03:56.561 --> 00:03:57.520
how things work,

59
00:03:57.670 --> 00:04:01.540
but more importantly perhaps how all the things work that we take for granted.

60
00:04:02.080 --> 00:04:04.990
And that to me has always been the most important part of the book.
Why?

61
00:04:05.140 --> 00:04:07.270
Which is why the book has always,
I think,

62
00:04:07.330 --> 00:04:12.330
deserved to be updated because there's new stuff now that we've already started.

63
00:04:12.670 --> 00:04:15.610
I mean,
not started,
we've already completely taken for granted.

64
00:04:15.790 --> 00:04:18.250
I'm assuming that you guys are so far ahead of the curve,

65
00:04:18.430 --> 00:04:20.820
but even those things that I'm thinking about,
uh,

66
00:04:20.890 --> 00:04:25.780
seem sort of old fashioned and dated,
but no to most of us.
Um,
you know,

67
00:04:25.781 --> 00:04:29.470
knowing how a a cell phone works at a touch screen works and that sort of stuff

68
00:04:29.650 --> 00:04:33.490
is still or should be interesting to the average reader.

69
00:04:33.491 --> 00:04:38.140
And I'm going for the average reader when it comes to visually presenting,

70
00:04:38.500 --> 00:04:43.180
um,
this information.
So this was the diagram and uh,

71
00:04:43.210 --> 00:04:44.620
this is one of the first image.

72
00:04:44.650 --> 00:04:49.650
These are too early images I made and these were done for I think a Frankfurt

73
00:04:50.201 --> 00:04:51.400
book fair or something like that.

74
00:04:51.400 --> 00:04:55.900
They wanted to present the idea of this 400 page book about machines and get all

75
00:04:55.901 --> 00:05:00.610
their European,
um,
cope publishers lined up and so on and so forth.

76
00:05:00.790 --> 00:05:04.990
And the American publisher of course,
uh,
lined up,
um,

77
00:05:05.440 --> 00:05:08.410
text,
little text heavy,
a little little doll.

78
00:05:09.070 --> 00:05:14.070
But I declined the first time they asked me if I would be willing to do this job

79
00:05:15.220 --> 00:05:19.870
because I honestly just didn't think that I could stay with it long enough to

80
00:05:19.871 --> 00:05:24.580
get 400 pages worth of this stuff done without becoming seriously ill.

81
00:05:25.270 --> 00:05:29.340
Um,
so,
so this was a,

82
00:05:29.360 --> 00:05:31.690
this was again a,
an early mock up.

83
00:05:32.320 --> 00:05:34.480
It looks like a Sears Roebuck catalog.

84
00:05:35.440 --> 00:05:38.740
It looks like they've jammed every conceivable little contraption in there that

85
00:05:38.741 --> 00:05:40.810
you can fit in there.
Um,

86
00:05:41.410 --> 00:05:45.160
all that's left from that first slide was that little bit with the,
uh,
you know,

87
00:05:45.161 --> 00:05:49.690
the sort of gears and the ferry,
the merry go round and at the fair,

88
00:05:49.990 --> 00:05:53.650
that sort of stuff.
It's,
David is this enough space for this drawing?

89
00:05:54.430 --> 00:05:57.260
So they were willing to shrink the text if my,
if I,
no,

90
00:05:57.261 --> 00:06:00.100
my tents have to be higher.
But,
um,

91
00:06:00.380 --> 00:06:04.490
nobody said can we get rid of some of this stuff?
Until I did,

92
00:06:05.240 --> 00:06:09.380
but I didn't have any alternative plan.
So I,
um,

93
00:06:10.250 --> 00:06:14.390
started sketching,
which is what I always do.
Um,

94
00:06:14.450 --> 00:06:16.150
and I was trying to figure,
okay,
let's,

95
00:06:16.370 --> 00:06:19.490
this thing is going to start with levers that seems fairly straight forward.

96
00:06:19.491 --> 00:06:21.760
Let's,
let's just figure out how are we going to,

97
00:06:21.990 --> 00:06:26.840
how do you present levers in a way that is,
um,
interesting that is engaging.

98
00:06:27.350 --> 00:06:32.000
Um,
accuracy goes without saying,
but engaging is critical.
Um,
we could have,

99
00:06:32.001 --> 00:06:32.960
we could have the,

100
00:06:32.990 --> 00:06:37.320
you may know and some of you probably have seen maybe even own,
um,

101
00:06:38.090 --> 00:06:41.450
the 19 was it 1980,

102
00:06:41.451 --> 00:06:45.590
maybe a German edition of how things work.

103
00:06:45.590 --> 00:06:50.360
I think it was called,
um,
you know,
before volumes and ultimately,
uh,

104
00:06:50.420 --> 00:06:54.740
and,
and the,
all the illustrations were the two colors,
black and red,
I believe.

105
00:06:55.130 --> 00:06:57.770
Um,
all line work,
uh,

106
00:06:57.800 --> 00:07:01.880
mechanical drawings like you do in high school.
Um,
but detailed,

107
00:07:01.910 --> 00:07:05.590
I mean incredibly detailed cross sections of machines and stuff like that.
Uh,

108
00:07:05.630 --> 00:07:10.630
as if everybody who was interested in machines already knew how to read cross

109
00:07:11.271 --> 00:07:15.240
sections and,
and those kinds of details.
Um,

110
00:07:15.290 --> 00:07:19.220
so it did extremely well because I think for many of us,

111
00:07:20.720 --> 00:07:24.530
we felt that these books would contain everything we would ever need to know

112
00:07:24.560 --> 00:07:27.900
ever.
Um,
and,
and it's really kind of,
um,

113
00:07:28.910 --> 00:07:33.770
reaffirming to be able to carry a volume like that around with you as you go

114
00:07:33.771 --> 00:07:37.790
through life.
All the answers you would need about technology in that book.

115
00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:42.140
But it wasn't the kind of book that I think would have gotten to those people

116
00:07:42.141 --> 00:07:46.250
who weren't already kind of set up to understand it.
I mean,

117
00:07:46.251 --> 00:07:49.400
in terms of getting the information from it.
So,
um,

118
00:07:50.210 --> 00:07:54.530
so my approach was a little different.
I'm using my little Mac,
you know,

119
00:07:54.531 --> 00:07:56.840
that little box,
whatever it was,

120
00:07:57.290 --> 00:08:02.290
and the dot matrix printer and counting the letters to make sure I had,

121
00:08:02.370 --> 00:08:06.950
you know,
enough in,
in a row and whatever it was for spacing.
Um,

122
00:08:07.580 --> 00:08:09.830
I've created a obviously a stone age,

123
00:08:09.890 --> 00:08:14.890
laundry laundromat with presses and things of that nature and it'll give me a

124
00:08:15.111 --> 00:08:20.050
chance to play with the idea of levers,
levers,
and um,
also,
um,

125
00:08:20.930 --> 00:08:22.160
introduced concepts.

126
00:08:22.430 --> 00:08:26.720
So this is what I presented when we started talking and I kept going,

127
00:08:27.080 --> 00:08:31.160
uh,
with this idea of how to organize,
asking this question,
okay,

128
00:08:31.161 --> 00:08:35.180
how do we organize these levers?
And at the very bottom of this page,
you can see,

129
00:08:35.460 --> 00:08:39.290
um,
the cave people never completely went away even though the laundromat didn't

130
00:08:39.291 --> 00:08:42.680
make it.
Um,
and because I was drawing cave people,

131
00:08:42.950 --> 00:08:45.200
I thought I would populate it with um,

132
00:08:45.740 --> 00:08:50.030
other cave era things like in this case a mammoth.

133
00:08:50.810 --> 00:08:55.810
And the mammoth of course stayed because I played with the mammoth.

134
00:08:56.730 --> 00:09:00.720
I felt like I had a kindred spirit with the mammoth,

135
00:09:00.840 --> 00:09:05.070
somebody equally victimized by technology and um,

136
00:09:06.480 --> 00:09:06.900
but it,

137
00:09:06.900 --> 00:09:10.110
but it sort of completely changed the way we started to think about the pages.

138
00:09:10.710 --> 00:09:15.570
And this was going to be a book about machines that was going to be fun,
uh,

139
00:09:15.900 --> 00:09:20.430
and yet taking seriously.
So sketching,
sketching,

140
00:09:20.431 --> 00:09:24.580
sketching,
finally trying to figure out how,
how will you work with a page?
Um,

141
00:09:25.660 --> 00:09:29.030
and these are,
these are old,

142
00:09:29.031 --> 00:09:32.840
these are on yellow tracing paper that if I touch it too many more times will

143
00:09:32.841 --> 00:09:36.110
just disintegrate.
But it got the job done.

144
00:09:36.440 --> 00:09:40.370
This is one of the original pieces of art based on those sketches obviously.

145
00:09:40.700 --> 00:09:43.580
And it was from those,
um,
those,
those sketches.

146
00:09:43.581 --> 00:09:48.320
And from that sense of going back as far in history as possible to introduce the

147
00:09:48.321 --> 00:09:53.090
simplest of machines that I came up with,
this idea of the inventors notebook,

148
00:09:53.630 --> 00:09:58.630
the inventors notebook allowed me to sort of suggest this personality who was

149
00:10:00.290 --> 00:10:05.210
kind of interested in how things work,
but inevitably got it slightly backwards.

150
00:10:05.510 --> 00:10:08.210
And because it was clearly a page that was not you,
you know,

151
00:10:08.300 --> 00:10:12.830
hard and co hardened dried fast,
uh,
facts and all that sort of stuff.

152
00:10:12.950 --> 00:10:17.660
It was a playful intro.
Um,
I could get away with that,
but of course I,

153
00:10:17.661 --> 00:10:21.170
if I was going to say things backwards or misunderstand them,

154
00:10:21.350 --> 00:10:25.490
it had to be to set up the real information that would appear at the bottom of

155
00:10:25.491 --> 00:10:29.010
the page.
So,
so mammoths,
uh,

156
00:10:29.090 --> 00:10:30.680
with three different kinds of levers,
first,

157
00:10:30.700 --> 00:10:34.430
second and third class and your basic little diagrams at the bottom.

158
00:10:34.431 --> 00:10:36.860
But the fun stuff is up top.
And the story.
I,

159
00:10:37.020 --> 00:10:40.730
the only thing I wrote in this book were the little stories about the mammoth

160
00:10:40.880 --> 00:10:44.390
and um,
at his or her adventures,

161
00:10:45.140 --> 00:10:48.320
I did not have to write any of the technical stuff.
I just had to understand it.

162
00:10:49.130 --> 00:10:52.420
So then we can move from mammoths to levers while almost from mammoths,

163
00:10:52.430 --> 00:10:57.430
not quite leaving them behind to other devices that illustrate the use of

164
00:10:58.070 --> 00:11:02.780
levers.
The grand piano.
At the bottom of this illustration,

165
00:11:02.900 --> 00:11:03.220
uh,

166
00:11:03.220 --> 00:11:07.100
there used to be in the first edition and I believe also in the second edition.

167
00:11:07.700 --> 00:11:08.031
In fact,

168
00:11:08.031 --> 00:11:13.031
I know I'm a mechanical typewriter and other nice visual example of levers at

169
00:11:13.791 --> 00:11:16.130
work.
Um,
for this new addition,

170
00:11:16.310 --> 00:11:20.480
we've taken out the mechanical typewriter and we've taken out a few other things

171
00:11:20.481 --> 00:11:24.890
in order to free up some space for the new devices,

172
00:11:24.891 --> 00:11:29.540
the new machines and so on.
So they,
a foot pedal was a new addition.

173
00:11:30.360 --> 00:11:31.340
<v 2>Uh,
so,</v>

174
00:11:33.100 --> 00:11:35.590
<v 3>um,
warm gears,
you never know,
um,</v>

175
00:11:35.650 --> 00:11:37.990
whether an idea is actually worth holding onto or not,

176
00:11:37.991 --> 00:11:40.240
but it doesn't stop me from at least putting it on paper.

177
00:11:42.220 --> 00:11:42.960
<v 2>Okay.</v>

178
00:11:42.960 --> 00:11:47.790
<v 3>I'm looking to have some real fun here with gears,
gears and belts,</v>

179
00:11:48.030 --> 00:11:52.770
that sort of thing.
Waving hand,
huge scale,
Trojan,
horse sized,

180
00:11:53.170 --> 00:11:54.880
waving hand.
Um,

181
00:11:55.630 --> 00:12:00.040
this is just sitting at the drawing board with a pat of tracing paper and just

182
00:12:00.820 --> 00:12:05.470
putting down whatever popped into my mind,
um,
with one or two words in my head,

183
00:12:05.500 --> 00:12:09.310
the kind of guide,
the thought back to that first sketch,

184
00:12:09.311 --> 00:12:14.311
but now perhaps a more elaborate version of the fairground and the gears,

185
00:12:14.850 --> 00:12:15.683
um,

186
00:12:16.780 --> 00:12:20.980
which got sort of compressed and change the gears of disappeared for a moment as

187
00:12:20.981 --> 00:12:25.981
we're just looking at belts here and wheels trying to figure out how to really

188
00:12:26.681 --> 00:12:30.160
have fun with the visual parts of the visual imagery,

189
00:12:30.580 --> 00:12:35.580
but also make sure that the verbal chunks are from a compositional point of view

190
00:12:36.040 --> 00:12:40.300
in an appropriate place to not inhibit the flow across the spread.

191
00:12:40.600 --> 00:12:45.400
I'm always trying to figure out how to make these compositions work so that the,

192
00:12:45.610 --> 00:12:50.610
the reader is led in some sort of meaningful and hopefully useful way across the

193
00:12:50.711 --> 00:12:55.000
pages.
An early,

194
00:12:55.060 --> 00:12:58.300
um,
full color version.
Oh,
full color.

195
00:12:58.900 --> 00:13:02.680
That's another thing I should mention.
Uh,
the original book,
1988

196
00:13:04.810 --> 00:13:07.630
at 400 pages was um,

197
00:13:08.350 --> 00:13:12.670
half full color and half to color alternating spreads.

198
00:13:13.120 --> 00:13:14.950
Reason being to keep the price down.

199
00:13:15.340 --> 00:13:18.550
They were worried about the cost of a 400 page book.
Um,

200
00:13:18.730 --> 00:13:22.510
so we did half of it in two color.
This is one of the two colors,

201
00:13:22.511 --> 00:13:26.320
but it's just really nasty.
This is a very nasty spread.
It was nasty then.

202
00:13:26.321 --> 00:13:30.010
It's a nasty now.
So I reworked it and um,

203
00:13:30.790 --> 00:13:34.720
now we're looking at the color that was actually reproduced in the book back in

204
00:13:35.830 --> 00:13:40.210
88 and the gears now have become larger and clearer.

205
00:13:40.870 --> 00:13:42.330
They weren't lost,
you know,

206
00:13:42.490 --> 00:13:46.150
amid all that other stuff in the earlier on in the earlier spread.

207
00:13:46.570 --> 00:13:50.140
But still it's fun and the little elements of play,

208
00:13:50.410 --> 00:13:52.900
I hope reward those,

209
00:13:53.290 --> 00:13:56.710
particularly those younger readers who come back and look at the book a second

210
00:13:56.711 --> 00:13:59.500
time and the third time and a fourth time.
And this is not,
I hope,

211
00:13:59.501 --> 00:14:02.120
a one read book.
Um,
I,

212
00:14:02.320 --> 00:14:07.320
I hope and it's the only reason I could use to sort of justify the silliness of

213
00:14:07.601 --> 00:14:08.434
parts of it.

214
00:14:08.500 --> 00:14:12.910
It's a book that has to welcome a multi-varied approach,

215
00:14:13.480 --> 00:14:16.900
but if you just want to get in there and get the information that also has to be

216
00:14:16.901 --> 00:14:20.470
clear,
this is the revised,

217
00:14:20.890 --> 00:14:24.820
the newly revised spread,
uh,
from the way things work now.

218
00:14:25.240 --> 00:14:30.240
And I went back in and recolored all of the art that was done in two color back

219
00:14:31.901 --> 00:14:35.950
in 88.
That was my,
that was kind of my,
the deal,

220
00:14:35.980 --> 00:14:39.190
if I was going to have to go back into this book and Redo all this stuff,

221
00:14:39.550 --> 00:14:44.410
I at least wanted a chance to change once.
And for all those two callers pieces,

222
00:14:44.590 --> 00:14:48.500
not because they're just two color,
but because in many cases,
um,

223
00:14:48.940 --> 00:14:53.180
they weren't as clear as they could be when it came to reading the information.

224
00:14:53.180 --> 00:14:57.080
So here was a chance to make sure the line work held up and um,
and,

225
00:14:57.081 --> 00:15:01.370
and it was done digitally.
I mean,
I,
I sat there with my,
have a very sophisticated

226
00:15:03.080 --> 00:15:07.790
computer system.
I'm still using Photoshop elements.

227
00:15:08.840 --> 00:15:11.240
So,
which came with my scanner.

228
00:15:12.620 --> 00:15:16.010
I have nothing to do with the cloud.
I have no idea what they've been up to.

229
00:15:16.011 --> 00:15:17.540
They probably been up to great stuff.

230
00:15:17.690 --> 00:15:21.830
Here I am using stone age digital technology,
um,

231
00:15:22.160 --> 00:15:27.160
to take out the color from a two color drawing without killing the lines and

232
00:15:28.281 --> 00:15:33.110
then putting color back in and trying to hold on to some sense of texture that

233
00:15:33.111 --> 00:15:37.960
will match the full color pieces that were leaving as they were.
Um,

234
00:15:38.210 --> 00:15:41.900
I did not want it to look like a book that had been messed with and wanted it to

235
00:15:41.930 --> 00:15:45.350
look like a new book that was sort of consistent from beginning to end.

236
00:15:45.351 --> 00:15:50.150
And I think the reproduction of it was,
has been so terrific that,
um,

237
00:15:50.240 --> 00:15:51.073
that it all worked.

238
00:15:52.430 --> 00:15:55.730
These were two color in the original book.

239
00:15:56.060 --> 00:16:00.770
They're now clear to read the gears.
Um,
as you can see on the right hand side,

240
00:16:01.100 --> 00:16:03.050
um,
we're really lost.

241
00:16:03.380 --> 00:16:08.380
It got muddy and dark and so now you can actually see where the different gears,

242
00:16:08.830 --> 00:16:11.810
um,
are and how they relate to each other.

243
00:16:13.920 --> 00:16:17.330
There a two color as a four color,
um,

244
00:16:17.600 --> 00:16:19.010
minor changes.

245
00:16:19.011 --> 00:16:23.060
Now I didn't want it sort of go crazy with the color I did in a couple of spots,

246
00:16:23.061 --> 00:16:24.200
but I didn't generally speaking,

247
00:16:24.201 --> 00:16:29.201
want to go crazy with it because one of the limitations forced upon me by the

248
00:16:30.441 --> 00:16:33.430
two color for color alterations wasn't,

249
00:16:33.440 --> 00:16:38.330
the color stuff couldn't be crazier.
It would've created a real,
um,

250
00:16:38.570 --> 00:16:40.420
disruption.
Um,

251
00:16:40.580 --> 00:16:44.840
as you turn the page to two color would've looked really don't and dead next to

252
00:16:44.841 --> 00:16:47.000
a really vibrant to color spread.

253
00:16:47.060 --> 00:16:52.060
So the color was muted back then to match the two color limitations.

254
00:16:52.430 --> 00:16:55.250
And this time I was making new color,
but it had to,

255
00:16:55.280 --> 00:17:00.050
it was muted now by the old color.
Um,
one of Neil's,

256
00:17:00.200 --> 00:17:04.940
uh,
when he got frustrated with me,
he would make these,
these drawings,

257
00:17:04.941 --> 00:17:05.810
these diagrams.

258
00:17:06.080 --> 00:17:10.430
So we wanted to do the engine in a and m show me everything that he felt should

259
00:17:10.431 --> 00:17:14.390
be in it.
And,
and then we would talk about what it does and so on and so forth.

260
00:17:14.391 --> 00:17:18.350
And my job was then to okay interpret.
And,
um,

261
00:17:18.470 --> 00:17:21.350
so it just a series of sketches,
what point of view,

262
00:17:21.650 --> 00:17:23.900
where are we when we look at this engine,

263
00:17:23.901 --> 00:17:28.901
we need to be in the best place from which to see the bulk of the information

264
00:17:30.890 --> 00:17:35.750
clearly and begin to understand how it all works together.
You can't necessarily,

265
00:17:35.780 --> 00:17:40.180
um,
for instance take a photograph of an engine that,
um,

266
00:17:40.820 --> 00:17:45.470
will be the most ideal spot.
You're,
you're going to sacrifice things.
I can,

267
00:17:45.770 --> 00:17:49.680
as an illustrator,
I can move things around a little bit.
I can distort slightly.

268
00:17:50.070 --> 00:17:51.820
So these,
these,

269
00:17:51.830 --> 00:17:55.860
some sketches are kind of a glimpse into the process.

270
00:17:55.861 --> 00:17:58.780
These are all just pieces of tracing paper.
Um,

271
00:17:59.730 --> 00:18:02.280
and I'm playing with point of view.
I want this thing to be dramatic.

272
00:18:02.281 --> 00:18:05.000
It's got to be one of the most influential machines,
um,

273
00:18:06.030 --> 00:18:10.850
certainly ever made in my lifetime.
And uh,
so it needed to,

274
00:18:11.040 --> 00:18:15.850
it,
it could afford to have some power.
So you chain,
you look up at this thing,

275
00:18:15.851 --> 00:18:20.380
you sort of look up in wonder at it perhaps.
Um,
now redraw.

276
00:18:20.381 --> 00:18:23.320
It was maybe things were off,
maybe the um,
you know,

277
00:18:23.740 --> 00:18:28.030
various pieces of the cracks were off or out of alignment or something like
that.

278
00:18:28.031 --> 00:18:31.090
So you're always sketching over sketching over sketching.

279
00:18:31.420 --> 00:18:35.740
I draw on paper all the time,
even though I use elements,

280
00:18:36.070 --> 00:18:39.910
um,
maybe it's elements six,
I can't remember.
Uh,

281
00:18:41.560 --> 00:18:46.150
but the drawings have to be on paper because it just feels right.
I have tried,

282
00:18:46.780 --> 00:18:51.730
um,
I work obviously on a tablet when I'm putting the color in a and I've gotten

283
00:18:51.731 --> 00:18:52.420
used to it,

284
00:18:52.420 --> 00:18:57.420
but I can't say it gives me pleasure to move that stylists over the,

285
00:18:58.120 --> 00:19:02.230
my little bamboo tablet.
Let me,
I told you a stone age,
um,

286
00:19:02.920 --> 00:19:05.980
and I've entertained the notion of trying to go to a real screen,
you know,

287
00:19:05.981 --> 00:19:08.900
and draw on it and,
and all that sort of stuff.
That's good.

288
00:19:10.630 --> 00:19:14.530
It sounds like too much work.
Anyway,

289
00:19:14.531 --> 00:19:18.730
those are the first version.
Full color version,
very muted.

290
00:19:19.120 --> 00:19:22.960
And um,
in fact,
at the end I didn't like it.
So I,
I,

291
00:19:23.280 --> 00:19:27.850
I reworked it,
move things around a bit.
This is the new one.
This is the one that,

292
00:19:27.851 --> 00:19:32.410
you know from the first edition of the book and that has been reproduced again

293
00:19:32.860 --> 00:19:37.450
in the latest edition of the book.
The angels are still there.
Um,

294
00:19:37.750 --> 00:19:42.230
you need angels.
If you want to suggest any kind of,
um,

295
00:19:43.120 --> 00:19:45.980
mythical importance,
any kind of,
um,

296
00:19:46.900 --> 00:19:51.640
spiritual impact from these devices than angels.
And they're,

297
00:19:51.850 --> 00:19:56.350
you know,
they're the low bidders,
so they got the job.
Uh,

298
00:19:57.490 --> 00:20:00.850
here's the,
um,
harvester,
the combine harvester.

299
00:20:01.330 --> 00:20:05.110
This was a two color image in the first book.
This is,
believe it or not,

300
00:20:05.111 --> 00:20:08.560
it's a four color piece of art,
but it's much clearer.

301
00:20:08.560 --> 00:20:12.790
It's so much easier to read now the flow of wheat and all the stuff,
um,

302
00:20:12.791 --> 00:20:16.780
that gets thrown away and the way it's stored and,
and whatnot.
Uh,

303
00:20:18.100 --> 00:20:20.950
the sewing machine was fun,
super scale,

304
00:20:21.190 --> 00:20:25.500
changing the scale of something I always find amusing.
Um,

305
00:20:25.660 --> 00:20:27.330
it can make something look more important.

306
00:20:27.331 --> 00:20:28.870
It could make it look more intimidating,

307
00:20:28.871 --> 00:20:33.490
but it can also make it look clear because you can see,
um,
you know,

308
00:20:33.491 --> 00:20:38.260
see the detail better if you blow it up.
And also as an illustrator,

309
00:20:38.261 --> 00:20:39.400
you're,
you're an editor.

310
00:20:39.490 --> 00:20:42.940
The whole time you're also deciding what to leave in and what to get rid of,

311
00:20:43.120 --> 00:20:47.410
what's really important here and what can stay.
So that's,
um,

312
00:20:47.470 --> 00:20:52.470
I often think that it may be one of the most important jobs of an illustrator is

313
00:20:52.721 --> 00:20:55.000
to serve as editor and decide what goes in.

314
00:20:55.210 --> 00:20:56.740
You have to know what you're trying to say.

315
00:20:57.310 --> 00:20:59.320
And if you do know what you're trying to say,

316
00:20:59.321 --> 00:21:02.200
it's easy to see those things that are simply going to disrupt it or get in the

317
00:21:02.201 --> 00:21:05.080
way.
It might look impressive.
You might really want to draw it,

318
00:21:05.380 --> 00:21:09.010
but it might not actually serve the purpose of the end of the day of um,

319
00:21:09.370 --> 00:21:10.810
communicating clearly.

320
00:21:12.250 --> 00:21:16.760
Drone obviously is not from an older edition.
That's a new addition.
Um,

321
00:21:18.810 --> 00:21:21.120
and the,
um,
you know,
you don't know who's,
uh,

322
00:21:21.150 --> 00:21:25.950
who's a little wing that is sticking out from the Brownstone Church,

323
00:21:26.340 --> 00:21:31.240
uh,
until you look at the screen of the little handheld controller.
Um,

324
00:21:31.350 --> 00:21:34.170
so anyway you tell a little story in there and um,

325
00:21:34.380 --> 00:21:38.130
those are the things I'm talking about when I say those things that you go back

326
00:21:38.131 --> 00:21:40.590
to this,
maybe you don't even see it the first time.

327
00:21:40.591 --> 00:21:41.850
Maybe you don't even see it the third time.

328
00:21:42.000 --> 00:21:45.210
Maybe you don't see it until you're lucky enough to be sitting there with a kid

329
00:21:46.230 --> 00:21:50.100
and your book or his or her book open and they pointed out to you.

330
00:21:51.880 --> 00:21:54.310
I would recommend that we can't sell the books with kids.

331
00:21:54.400 --> 00:21:58.520
You have to get your own.
But the book has those things in it.
Um,

332
00:21:59.110 --> 00:22:01.960
this is a model for,
this is one of those funny compositions,
um,

333
00:22:02.290 --> 00:22:05.950
where a lot of things got kind of moved over into the left hand page.

334
00:22:06.190 --> 00:22:10.960
The text actually in this on the left hand page spread actually simplifies the

335
00:22:10.961 --> 00:22:14.190
open spaces here just seem kind of um,
you know,

336
00:22:14.200 --> 00:22:15.760
at a loss for some sort of purpose.

337
00:22:15.910 --> 00:22:19.960
The fact is though they contained the chunks of text which stops that whole

338
00:22:19.961 --> 00:22:22.390
thing from just kind of floating around in a messy way.

339
00:22:22.570 --> 00:22:26.790
But what we wanted was room for the airport scanner on the,
uh,

340
00:22:26.860 --> 00:22:30.100
on the right hand page.
And so why did I choose,
um,

341
00:22:30.190 --> 00:22:34.810
the white rabbit from Alice in wonderland?
Because I wanted the watch.

342
00:22:35.950 --> 00:22:40.210
I wanted the watch to show up on the screen in the lower right hand corner.

343
00:22:42.980 --> 00:22:47.900
Sometimes the logic seems a little bit,
um,
unusual,
uh,
and stretched.

344
00:22:48.140 --> 00:22:51.050
But nevertheless,
that's why we've got a rabbit here,
uh,

345
00:22:51.051 --> 00:22:53.640
about to put his paws up and,

346
00:22:53.800 --> 00:22:58.760
and be looked at off into space.

347
00:22:59.120 --> 00:22:59.953
Uh,

348
00:23:00.700 --> 00:23:01.210
<v 2>yeah,</v>

349
00:23:01.210 --> 00:23:04.210
<v 3>Moon landers on Mars Rovers and things of that nature.</v>

350
00:23:04.390 --> 00:23:07.480
Now this is one of the instances.
This is a double.
There's a,
um,

351
00:23:08.080 --> 00:23:11.700
two color spread from the original and uh,

352
00:23:12.790 --> 00:23:17.230
but it's hard to see the heat and the furnace.
Um,

353
00:23:17.260 --> 00:23:22.150
it's hard to see that the,
the uh,
the heat in the Bessemer

354
00:23:24.220 --> 00:23:28.220
contraption.
Um,
so I did it again,

355
00:23:29.000 --> 00:23:32.150
new color for color,
so to call it a four color.
And in this case,

356
00:23:32.151 --> 00:23:36.890
I think you've got a fighting chance of telling that it's hot and seeing where

357
00:23:36.891 --> 00:23:41.150
it's hot and we're at Kohl's and so on.
So that was worth going to.

358
00:23:41.151 --> 00:23:45.020
This is the old dot matrix printer.
The point of view,
I,

359
00:23:45.290 --> 00:23:48.830
the perspective you use sometimes can give things a,

360
00:23:48.831 --> 00:23:52.730
an extra dignity.
Uh,
you know,
so a real boldness.

361
00:23:52.731 --> 00:23:55.550
This is something from Star Trek.
Uh,

362
00:23:55.850 --> 00:23:57.890
it's probably filled with lots of little people,

363
00:23:58.070 --> 00:24:03.040
but for me it's just the dot matrix printer.
Um,

364
00:24:03.070 --> 00:24:07.720
one of my favorite compositions that sort of following the movement of the tape

365
00:24:07.990 --> 00:24:09.220
through a video recorder.

366
00:24:09.250 --> 00:24:13.360
The video recorder is gone from the new edition has to be replaced.

367
00:24:13.361 --> 00:24:18.010
And as is the sound,
the sound tape recording,
uh,

368
00:24:18.310 --> 00:24:22.930
method.
Uh,
so,
but you can see this gives you a couple of clues to is how I work.

369
00:24:23.140 --> 00:24:26.710
There are pieces of paper stuck over paper with scotch tape that have changed

370
00:24:26.711 --> 00:24:29.860
colors.
Uh,
magic tape is my preferred tape.

371
00:24:30.160 --> 00:24:34.030
So I have elements,
magic tape,

372
00:24:34.930 --> 00:24:38.170
my own photocopier,
and that's pretty much it.

373
00:24:38.800 --> 00:24:43.510
One flat surface that's generally speaking clear so that I can draw on it

374
00:24:43.511 --> 00:24:47.500
whenever I feel like I need to.
Or there's a deadline approaching

375
00:24:49.180 --> 00:24:52.230
light bulbs,
the first spread and the light bulb.
Um,

376
00:24:52.270 --> 00:24:55.210
Ada used to be just that light bulb in the lower left hand corner.

377
00:24:55.211 --> 00:24:57.580
Not The candle but the light bulb.
Now it's dead.

378
00:24:57.950 --> 00:25:01.990
Electricity has been turned off and we looking at the replacements and a sense

379
00:25:01.991 --> 00:25:05.470
of where we're going.
And I,
I sort of did amp up the color a little bit here,

380
00:25:06.630 --> 00:25:07.930
the video recorder

381
00:25:09.640 --> 00:25:14.640
and step by step sort of process of reading the frames and how it focuses and a

382
00:25:15.250 --> 00:25:19.030
projector,
a video projector and a three d projector.

383
00:25:20.110 --> 00:25:22.950
They think the thing that I loved about the um,
the video projector,

384
00:25:23.000 --> 00:25:27.400
those little things at the bottom,
those tiny little mirrors,
um,

385
00:25:27.490 --> 00:25:31.600
a grid of mirrors that all move in,
you know,
in a slightly different way.

386
00:25:31.601 --> 00:25:34.900
Just enough to send the light off at the wrong in the wrong direction if you

387
00:25:34.901 --> 00:25:38.110
don't want it or channel in the right direction if you do one.

388
00:25:38.111 --> 00:25:40.930
I love those things because they seem so practical.

389
00:25:41.290 --> 00:25:42.760
It's just a sensible solution.

390
00:25:43.030 --> 00:25:45.730
The trick is to get like 10,000 little mirrors on a,

391
00:25:45.731 --> 00:25:50.731
on something the size of the gum that I just smaller than the gum I spit out

392
00:25:53.160 --> 00:25:54.540
and then recording digitally,

393
00:25:54.541 --> 00:25:59.340
I'm sound and light breaking the uh,
this information down,

394
00:25:59.430 --> 00:26:01.760
simplifying it to,
uh,

395
00:26:01.770 --> 00:26:06.000
work with the text and the in the most sort of in the clearest way possible.
Uh,

396
00:26:06.030 --> 00:26:09.480
these are,
these are looser spreads in in some ways a more open,

397
00:26:09.481 --> 00:26:12.960
more spacious spreads then we're in the first edition.
So,
um,

398
00:26:13.050 --> 00:26:15.300
I don't know whether that's because the information was becoming more

399
00:26:15.301 --> 00:26:20.190
technically complex and I didn't want to sort of over over over do it three d

400
00:26:20.191 --> 00:26:22.230
printer almost self explanatory.

401
00:26:22.231 --> 00:26:26.490
But nevertheless we decided to put it in the book because it has become a more

402
00:26:26.491 --> 00:26:30.450
familiar item in schools and even in homes and offices and workplaces.

403
00:26:31.350 --> 00:26:36.120
The hybrid
almost didn't do this happened to be at a soccer game.

404
00:26:36.420 --> 00:26:39.580
Um,
when my son was playing and,
um,

405
00:26:39.690 --> 00:26:44.310
I was talking to the father of another player on the team and I was telling him

406
00:26:44.311 --> 00:26:47.790
about the book I was working on and the revisions to the way things work.

407
00:26:47.791 --> 00:26:51.270
And he said,
well,
so you're going to do the hybrid.
And you know,

408
00:26:51.271 --> 00:26:54.910
that probably he probably saw the blood drained from my face when I realize

409
00:26:55.350 --> 00:26:59.220
we're halfway through these illustrations and none of us thought about the

410
00:26:59.221 --> 00:27:00.900
hybrid,
the hybrid car.

411
00:27:01.200 --> 00:27:05.730
And the car had been such a major part of the book for the first two editions

412
00:27:05.760 --> 00:27:10.710
anyway,
caught it at the last minute,
thanked him profusely,

413
00:27:11.130 --> 00:27:15.150
storage devices.
This is a problem.
Um,
for me,
I mean,

414
00:27:15.180 --> 00:27:19.830
how much can I do here to get this idea?
I'm,

415
00:27:19.860 --> 00:27:24.600
all I can really do is be the x ray eyes looking at a UBS,
uh,

416
00:27:24.670 --> 00:27:27.570
you know,
flashdrive and things like that.
USB,
UBS,

417
00:27:27.900 --> 00:27:31.800
a flashdrive and um,
those devices,

418
00:27:31.801 --> 00:27:35.700
it's just little boxes on a green bed.
And,
uh,

419
00:27:35.910 --> 00:27:40.770
I think that if there's to be another version of this,

420
00:27:40.771 --> 00:27:45.630
um,
of this book,
first of all,
I probably won't do it.
But secondly,

421
00:27:45.720 --> 00:27:49.680
I think it's going to have to be really huge because I want you,
I mean,

422
00:27:49.681 --> 00:27:53.900
I'd like to get inside the chip and you know,
to draw,

423
00:27:53.940 --> 00:27:57.510
but to draw even a little chip and draw it big enough so you can just see how

424
00:27:57.511 --> 00:28:01.950
complicated it is.
We do talk about gates and all that sort of stuff,
but um,

425
00:28:04.380 --> 00:28:08.630
I think that may be the next step,
really large,
really large,
really large book.

426
00:28:08.640 --> 00:28:10.770
And I,
I mean the idea of making it another book,

427
00:28:11.010 --> 00:28:14.160
I'm always appeals to me over it moving to another medium,

428
00:28:14.190 --> 00:28:17.850
even though that may be kind of impractical because I love the idea of rewarding

429
00:28:17.851 --> 00:28:22.851
that sort of quietness of confronting the reader with all this technology,

430
00:28:24.270 --> 00:28:27.540
but in a way that so friendly,
they are completely in control of what's it,

431
00:28:27.560 --> 00:28:30.930
they can't press the wrong button and suddenly find themselves looking at

432
00:28:30.931 --> 00:28:33.840
something that has nothing to do with it.
We're being distracted by ads.

433
00:28:34.140 --> 00:28:38.550
The great thing about books is we have no ad space in this book at all.
Um,

434
00:28:38.910 --> 00:28:42.840
there are lots of cross references.
You could be sent back to different pages.

435
00:28:42.841 --> 00:28:45.330
That's,
that's true.
That's in there.
But,
um,

436
00:28:45.870 --> 00:28:49.130
the whole thing though is basically your call and,

437
00:28:49.370 --> 00:28:54.370
and you can obviously absorb this stuff at a rate that feels right for you.

438
00:28:56.370 --> 00:28:58.050
Okay.
30 minutes is up.

439
00:28:58.440 --> 00:29:03.440
It is now time for me to open the floor to questions about anything that can

440
00:29:04.951 --> 00:29:07.630
have to do with this book.
It can have to do with [inaudible].

441
00:29:09.150 --> 00:29:14.150
<v 4>Just my question is what is the drawing that is just kind of inspired you the</v>

442
00:29:14.251 --> 00:29:16.680
most?
Or what drawing did you make that was just like,

443
00:29:16.681 --> 00:29:18.930
you can't believe you even explained it well

444
00:29:19.550 --> 00:29:22.820
<v 3>from this book?
Uh,
sure,
sure.</v>

445
00:29:23.210 --> 00:29:27.380
That's what I was a little noncommittal.
Um,
I mean what I,

446
00:29:27.381 --> 00:29:30.350
the reason I was asking,
I was hoping you were going to give me a way out.

447
00:29:30.530 --> 00:29:33.200
I think the,
um,
um,

448
00:29:35.990 --> 00:29:40.220
there isn't one that honestly comes to mind as sort of like one boy.

449
00:29:40.250 --> 00:29:41.051
I really nailed it.

450
00:29:41.051 --> 00:29:44.680
I can tell you one that I did not nail and that is the automatic transmission of

451
00:29:44.681 --> 00:29:49.480
the car.
It was the very last drawing I did in,
um,
in 88,

452
00:29:49.481 --> 00:29:53.470
87.
I mean,
literally it was April of Ada.

453
00:29:53.950 --> 00:29:57.520
The book was going to press and I had still not dumb the

454
00:29:59.170 --> 00:30:03.730
automatic transmission of the car.
I drew it.
I still can't tell you how it works,

455
00:30:04.510 --> 00:30:07.360
but nobody's brought it up.
So I must've been working with,
you know,

456
00:30:07.690 --> 00:30:11.380
I was working with a good team who would have spotted anything,
but I did not.

457
00:30:11.590 --> 00:30:14.860
That's the one drawing where I don't feel I absorbed the information in the way

458
00:30:14.861 --> 00:30:16.600
I like to.
Um,

459
00:30:16.990 --> 00:30:21.990
but I would go back to a book like cathedral and say that those are the drawings

460
00:30:22.150 --> 00:30:26.060
that in a way,
um,
make me feel,
uh,

461
00:30:26.800 --> 00:30:31.080
proud to have done them because they come there.

462
00:30:31.090 --> 00:30:35.740
The end result of really getting to know how you pile one stone on top of

463
00:30:35.741 --> 00:30:39.490
another,
which you can tell from my tongue in cheek,
uh,

464
00:30:39.940 --> 00:30:43.690
comments about the digital stuff I use,
I feel much more comfortable with.

465
00:30:43.800 --> 00:30:46.960
It can be a piece of limestone and we'll just put another piece of limestone on

466
00:30:46.961 --> 00:30:49.610
top of it until we're done.
And,

467
00:30:49.930 --> 00:30:54.470
but then it looks fantastic and then it stands for 800 years,
you know?

468
00:30:55.480 --> 00:30:57.160
Anyway,
go ahead.
Yeah.

469
00:30:57.490 --> 00:31:01.040
<v 5>Curious how this became your book.
You know,
your name is</v>

470
00:31:01.080 --> 00:31:05.280
<v 3>prominent on the cover and you say you work with a team and I vow and when did</v>

471
00:31:05.281 --> 00:31:07.410
that happen?
That my name,

472
00:31:07.800 --> 00:31:12.240
because my name is on the front of this book because of the American market.

473
00:31:12.241 --> 00:31:17.241
That was a decision made by the publisher and it has been a s a s a source of

474
00:31:21.810 --> 00:31:25.800
discomfort from the very beginning,
from the very first time it happened.

475
00:31:25.801 --> 00:31:28.170
But when,
when Houghton Mifflin,
uh,

476
00:31:28.470 --> 00:31:32.940
picked up the book in the U S and I only did it cause Holton was my publisher,

477
00:31:33.180 --> 00:31:34.230
I only did it,
um,

478
00:31:35.850 --> 00:31:40.830
with decay on the condition that [inaudible] would do the American,

479
00:31:41.180 --> 00:31:43.460
the American version.
So,
um,

480
00:31:43.710 --> 00:31:48.710
but what happens is then people don't know Neil [inaudible] name in this

481
00:31:48.841 --> 00:31:53.520
country,
didn't know his name.
Um,
they knew me,
so it was simply easier.

482
00:31:53.670 --> 00:31:57.600
I would imagine that the pressure came from the sales department basically,

483
00:31:57.810 --> 00:32:01.260
who don't really want to have to explain things and they just want to,
okay,

484
00:32:01.261 --> 00:32:06.030
this has got Macaulay's names on top.
This must be good by many.
Um,

485
00:32:07.260 --> 00:32:10.800
what else would make sense?
So anyway,
whenever I,
whenever I go,

486
00:32:10.801 --> 00:32:11.820
I talk about the team.

487
00:32:11.970 --> 00:32:15.060
I always mentioned Neil and get Neil and Neil's no longer with us.

488
00:32:15.210 --> 00:32:16.890
Christopher Davis is no longer with us.

489
00:32:16.891 --> 00:32:21.390
He was one of the key guys for getting this idea developed.
Um,

490
00:32:21.510 --> 00:32:26.010
but I'm the,
I'm the shell,
you know,
it's as simple as that,
but I can draw.

491
00:32:26.850 --> 00:32:27.683
Yes.

492
00:32:28.460 --> 00:32:32.090
<v 5>You've been talking an awful lot about your background in low tech,</v>

493
00:32:32.180 --> 00:32:35.990
specifically well illustrating and explaining some extremely high tech things.

494
00:32:36.470 --> 00:32:39.980
I'm curious as to whether there were any,
uh,
any high tech

495
00:32:39.980 --> 00:32:42.650
<v 6>technologies that you decided to leave out.</v>

496
00:32:44.230 --> 00:32:49.030
<v 3>Again,
that was a,
that was a team decision.
Um,
and what I can remember,</v>

497
00:32:50.990 --> 00:32:55.820
they would have been more,
I mean,
maybe too technical,
maybe too esoteric,
um,
for,

498
00:32:56.390 --> 00:32:59.040
uh,
for,
for the audience we were after I,

499
00:32:59.370 --> 00:33:03.920
the whole idea from the beginning was kind of to open people's eyes to the basic

500
00:33:04.520 --> 00:33:06.470
information behind how things work.

501
00:33:06.770 --> 00:33:10.940
Whether it's a mechanical things or electrical things,
digital things,

502
00:33:11.330 --> 00:33:12.800
get the basics across,

503
00:33:12.980 --> 00:33:17.980
not try to anticipate what the next machine would be or even do the most

504
00:33:18.141 --> 00:33:20.180
sophisticated versions of those machines,

505
00:33:20.390 --> 00:33:24.170
but pick those things that would lend themselves to this kind of old fashioned

506
00:33:24.680 --> 00:33:28.850
kind of interpretation.
So it is all about,
it's about stimulating curiosity,

507
00:33:28.851 --> 00:33:30.630
but it's also about,
um,

508
00:33:30.680 --> 00:33:35.680
being reassuring that it is possible on some level to understand this stuff

509
00:33:36.140 --> 00:33:40.850
unless it's the automatic transmission.
Yes.

510
00:33:41.360 --> 00:33:43.230
<v 6>Uh,
first I wanna thank you.
Um,</v>

511
00:33:43.290 --> 00:33:46.680
I grew up a flipping through this book before I could even read it and I think

512
00:33:46.681 --> 00:33:51.440
that's a big part of why I'm here today.
Um,
you mentioned that,
um,

513
00:33:51.780 --> 00:33:54.360
you're trying to create these drawings so that there's simple enough for

514
00:33:54.361 --> 00:33:57.090
children to understand and I think they are.
Um,

515
00:33:57.180 --> 00:33:58.830
but having tried to explain things,

516
00:33:58.831 --> 00:34:03.360
I know that that's actually incredibly difficult and requires a very deep

517
00:34:03.361 --> 00:34:04.350
understanding of these.

518
00:34:04.351 --> 00:34:08.490
And I was wondering if you could go into your process of like how you and your

519
00:34:08.491 --> 00:34:12.870
team figure out the internals before you create these drawings.

520
00:34:13.060 --> 00:34:17.760
<v 3>Well,
sure.
Um,
I mean it's literally kneel largely and I,</v>

521
00:34:18.280 --> 00:34:21.900
um,
and maybe David Bernie locked in a room,
um,

522
00:34:22.030 --> 00:34:27.030
with whatever reference material Neil has brought to the table and we start

523
00:34:28.210 --> 00:34:32.320
like,
what is this thing?
Um,
what does it do?

524
00:34:32.860 --> 00:34:35.440
What's the most important thing about it?
And how

525
00:34:37.530 --> 00:34:38.280
do certain hat,

526
00:34:38.280 --> 00:34:41.490
what aspects of this machine and the way it works or similar shouldn't machines

527
00:34:41.491 --> 00:34:45.480
we might already have,
um,
introduced elsewhere in the book.
It was,

528
00:34:45.570 --> 00:34:50.570
it was always also about linking things and looking for surprising connections

529
00:34:51.181 --> 00:34:55.350
between,
between things in that the machines would do completely different,
um,

530
00:34:55.530 --> 00:34:59.530
jobs.
And yet the technology behind them,
um,

531
00:34:59.580 --> 00:35:03.570
would be very similar or there would be a strong overlaps.

532
00:35:03.840 --> 00:35:08.390
And it was just,
you know,
it literally back and forth.
Um,
okay,

533
00:35:08.410 --> 00:35:12.840
let's just,
we go through this and I'm drawing it and Neil is explaining it and,

534
00:35:13.320 --> 00:35:16.860
um,
I'm being corrected or I'm,

535
00:35:16.890 --> 00:35:21.420
and I'm trying to think a little bit even then probably about those things that

536
00:35:21.570 --> 00:35:25.680
seem exciting to me from what I've just heard.
And how could I,
you know,
can we,

537
00:35:25.800 --> 00:35:29.320
can I make this image in such a way that it will also,
um,

538
00:35:29.730 --> 00:35:31.020
promote that,

539
00:35:31.140 --> 00:35:36.060
that potential bit of excitement so that it enhances the engagement part of the

540
00:35:36.061 --> 00:35:40.170
job of,
of making these illustrations,
getting the information right as one thing,

541
00:35:40.290 --> 00:35:43.650
but engaging the audience is critical.
So,
um,

542
00:35:44.880 --> 00:35:45.691
but that was the process.

543
00:35:45.691 --> 00:35:49.170
It wasn't magic and we just stayed there until we were done and came out at the

544
00:35:49.170 --> 00:35:53.940
end of the day exhausted.
Um,
and did it until we had done 400 pages worth.

545
00:35:54.930 --> 00:35:55.763
Yeah.

546
00:35:55.920 --> 00:35:58.230
<v 7>So complete change of pace.
Um,</v>

547
00:35:58.920 --> 00:36:03.920
is it okay if I confess that I have a soft spot for motel of the mysteries and

548
00:36:05.250 --> 00:36:09.060
spent a good long time reading shortcut over and over to my children?

549
00:36:09.880 --> 00:36:14.800
<v 3>Yes,
it is actually his,
it's been,
please feel free.
Don't stop.
Don't stop there.</v>

550
00:36:16.930 --> 00:36:19.600
<v 7>But anyway,
um,
those have things somewhat,</v>

551
00:36:19.900 --> 00:36:22.720
I mean the playfulness is certainly present here,

552
00:36:22.721 --> 00:36:25.390
but these feel like very different books from this.

553
00:36:25.391 --> 00:36:28.570
And I'm wondering if you could just comment a little bit on this end from

554
00:36:28.571 --> 00:36:32.200
cathedral and from some of those others.
It seems like a very wide range of work.

555
00:36:32.201 --> 00:36:32.670
And,

556
00:36:32.670 --> 00:36:37.040
<v 3>um,
cathedral was the first of four or five books on architecture.</v>

557
00:36:37.400 --> 00:36:42.050
Um,
and I realized once I had done number five,
which happened to be castle,

558
00:36:42.051 --> 00:36:43.550
which is a very popular,

559
00:36:43.600 --> 00:36:48.560
but I almost couldn't get through it because there was nothing to learn.
Um,

560
00:36:48.590 --> 00:36:51.320
nothing new to learn as an illustrator.
As a designer.

561
00:36:51.620 --> 00:36:56.030
I was basically taking the formula that I had established with cathedral kind of

562
00:36:56.090 --> 00:36:56.571
proven,

563
00:36:56.571 --> 00:37:01.190
worked in city and impairment and plugging in new information,

564
00:37:01.191 --> 00:37:06.020
slightly new information,
uh,
in order to end up with a castle on a hill.
Um,

565
00:37:06.190 --> 00:37:09.770
I just couldn't imagine doing another of those books and that's when I kind of

566
00:37:09.771 --> 00:37:13.910
lost it slightly and said I want to do something completely different.
Um,

567
00:37:14.000 --> 00:37:17.750
and I had been traveling,
I'm giving talks at elementary schools and so on.

568
00:37:17.990 --> 00:37:21.590
And most of the elementary schools I was going toward the high schools,
whatever.

569
00:37:21.890 --> 00:37:23.470
Um,
these are,
uh,

570
00:37:23.690 --> 00:37:28.220
school districts that don't have huge budgets for fine hotels.
And so,
uh,

571
00:37:28.240 --> 00:37:31.750
authors and illustrators who pass through town get put in these,
um,

572
00:37:32.910 --> 00:37:36.320
whatever's available.
So I would walk into these motels,
you know,

573
00:37:36.321 --> 00:37:38.570
like one after another in different parts of the country.

574
00:37:38.870 --> 00:37:43.330
And I would start to notice these similar things like,
you know,
the,
uh,
the,

575
00:37:44.370 --> 00:37:47.690
the,
uh,
the plastic shower curtain still held up,

576
00:37:47.870 --> 00:37:50.730
but by only three rings,
um,

577
00:37:51.080 --> 00:37:53.240
those stainless steel or,

578
00:37:53.270 --> 00:37:58.070
or chrome plated something or other steel loops are hoops that stick out of the

579
00:37:58.071 --> 00:38:00.080
wall that they,
um,

580
00:38:00.410 --> 00:38:05.300
they wad the towels up under pressure and they stick them in so that if you pull

581
00:38:05.301 --> 00:38:08.450
it out without paying attention,
now he can be damaged by that.

582
00:38:08.451 --> 00:38:12.850
Like just like a car suddenly stopping.
Um,
but there were these crazy things.

583
00:38:12.870 --> 00:38:13.703
There was,
um,

584
00:38:14.330 --> 00:38:19.330
there was a light bulb fused to the plastic shade over the formica table,

585
00:38:20.210 --> 00:38:20.600
um,

586
00:38:20.600 --> 00:38:25.600
in front of the window that looked down on the green astroturf covering around

587
00:38:25.851 --> 00:38:28.210
the pool.
There was the pool.
Um,

588
00:38:28.250 --> 00:38:31.050
and I began to realize that anybody coming from another place,
I didn't,

589
00:38:31.060 --> 00:38:34.370
another time would begin to wonder if these weren't some kind of,

590
00:38:34.430 --> 00:38:38.410
if there was more,
it wasn't more to it that something symbolic going on here.

591
00:38:38.560 --> 00:38:41.830
So that's when I did motel.
I just wanted to play,

592
00:38:41.950 --> 00:38:44.920
I wanted to not do architecture,
but as you know,

593
00:38:45.130 --> 00:38:49.480
I drew it in a very kind of painstakingly old fashioned,

594
00:38:49.481 --> 00:38:50.410
serious way,

595
00:38:50.530 --> 00:38:55.420
completely confusing the times they look like images that might have been made

596
00:38:55.840 --> 00:39:00.180
when Howard Carter was actually um,
you know,
looking at Tooton Commons,

597
00:39:00.360 --> 00:39:05.360
a tomb as opposed to a story set 2000 years from now.

598
00:39:05.680 --> 00:39:09.820
So it was completely mixed up,
but I was having fun.
I was playing.

599
00:39:10.270 --> 00:39:15.270
The irony is that book is also still in print and fall.

600
00:39:15.401 --> 00:39:18.160
It has its own following and so on and so forth.
So that book,

601
00:39:18.520 --> 00:39:22.840
the way things work and the earlier architecture books continue to sort of move

602
00:39:22.841 --> 00:39:24.240
along.
Um,

603
00:39:25.390 --> 00:39:29.520
shortcut again was just a book to have some fun and play with full color and,

604
00:39:29.800 --> 00:39:31.680
and that sort of thing.
So I need a break.

605
00:39:31.990 --> 00:39:34.390
Those are vacation books for me in a way.
Yeah.

606
00:39:35.660 --> 00:39:37.430
<v 6>The question was are they going to be more,
but here,
let me,</v>

607
00:39:37.431 --> 00:39:39.170
let me ask this because I'm just following up on that.

608
00:39:39.171 --> 00:39:42.510
I'm also up here to praise you for the whimsy.
In these books.
I,
uh,

609
00:39:42.520 --> 00:39:46.010
I come from a lineage of engineers and architects and drafts people and

610
00:39:46.011 --> 00:39:47.660
illustrators.
And so we had,
you know,

611
00:39:47.690 --> 00:39:51.380
stacked high castle and pyramid and Citi and so forth at home.
But the one that,

612
00:39:51.410 --> 00:39:55.950
you know,
uh,
I as a young reader was of course most drawn to is great moments in

613
00:39:55.951 --> 00:39:58.390
architecture.
Um,
which I,
I just,
I,

614
00:39:58.391 --> 00:40:02.120
I love and I wish I could find my original copy of it.
Um,
but I think that that,

615
00:40:02.140 --> 00:40:04.280
that whimsy is so important because it,

616
00:40:04.510 --> 00:40:09.200
it enhances attention and attention being that prerequisite for understanding.

617
00:40:09.201 --> 00:40:13.760
And it seems like this whole AUV is about the way that knowing and understanding

618
00:40:13.761 --> 00:40:18.380
and teaching and showing her all related.
Early on in the,
in the talk you said,

619
00:40:19.100 --> 00:40:19.431
oh,
I didn't,

620
00:40:19.431 --> 00:40:21.830
I didn't write any of the technical words that just had an understand them.

621
00:40:21.950 --> 00:40:24.350
But I feel like that's the higher bar people,

622
00:40:24.351 --> 00:40:25.970
people write about technical things all the time,

623
00:40:25.971 --> 00:40:30.930
but fewer people understand them.
Um,
so I wanted to thank you for that.

624
00:40:30.931 --> 00:40:31.560
And likewise,

625
00:40:31.560 --> 00:40:34.640
I'll reiterate if there are any more vacation books coming were eagerly

626
00:40:34.650 --> 00:40:35.483
anticipated.

627
00:40:35.810 --> 00:40:39.250
<v 3>I,
um,
I don't know.
I don't know,
but I'm,</v>

628
00:40:39.430 --> 00:40:41.410
I was going to pick on something you said about,
uh,

629
00:40:42.620 --> 00:40:46.480
I mean it's really,
you could call this book the way I work,

630
00:40:46.510 --> 00:40:51.400
the way Mccauley works because it really is,
you know,
from a visual,

631
00:40:51.490 --> 00:40:55.450
a visual point of view,
it really is that revelation.
This is how I work.

632
00:40:55.451 --> 00:41:00.210
This is how I think.
I fortunately have great backup and,
um,
and,

633
00:41:00.211 --> 00:41:02.460
and all this terrific information that makes,
you know,

634
00:41:02.510 --> 00:41:06.160
the clear and well written and all that sort of stuff.
And,
you know,

635
00:41:06.161 --> 00:41:10.800
good guidance from an editorial perspective.
But basically it's me playing,
um,

636
00:41:10.990 --> 00:41:13.920
in a way that's not totally dissimilar from,
um,

637
00:41:13.990 --> 00:41:17.230
from shortcut or great moments in architecture.
Yup.

638
00:41:18.760 --> 00:41:21.320
<v 6>So you mentioned when you started talking about all of this,</v>

639
00:41:21.321 --> 00:41:22.550
that your goal was to,

640
00:41:22.570 --> 00:41:26.030
to kind of open people's eyes to all of the things that they took for granted in

641
00:41:26.031 --> 00:41:26.900
the world around them.

642
00:41:27.260 --> 00:41:30.920
And so I'm really curious how the team that you were working with decided,

643
00:41:30.921 --> 00:41:34.100
what were the things that people take for granted the world around them?

644
00:41:34.430 --> 00:41:34.881
<v 8>You know,
were,</v>

645
00:41:34.881 --> 00:41:38.510
were people looking around and just inspired by what they saw or did you talk

646
00:41:38.511 --> 00:41:42.330
with your families,
or how,
how was the decision made to what,

647
00:41:42.360 --> 00:41:44.630
what should go into the 400 pages?

648
00:41:45.440 --> 00:41:49.750
<v 3>It was,
I think mostly,
um,
just based on experience,</v>

649
00:41:49.780 --> 00:41:53.340
based on what we saw.
Um,
I mean the hybrid,
as I said,

650
00:41:53.350 --> 00:41:56.800
barely made it in just the luck of the draw.
Um,

651
00:41:57.460 --> 00:42:00.480
but I just,
you know,
you're sitting around and you're,

652
00:42:00.481 --> 00:42:03.580
you're at the table and you're having this conversation and you throw things out

653
00:42:04.000 --> 00:42:08.290
and they're the most obvious things.
Um,
when you know,

654
00:42:08.291 --> 00:42:12.010
after the fact they,
the most obvious things,
there's nothing in there that's um,

655
00:42:12.130 --> 00:42:15.130
that would surprise you.
They may be things that should be there.

656
00:42:15.131 --> 00:42:17.710
And they said it's your surprise that they're not.
But I,

657
00:42:17.730 --> 00:42:21.490
I don't think there's too much of that either.
Uh,
it's,
it was very,

658
00:42:21.520 --> 00:42:26.200
it was very common sense driven.
Those,
no,
um,
you know,
what are people doing?

659
00:42:26.280 --> 00:42:29.560
And everybody's walking around like this,
you know,
so let's do that.

660
00:42:29.860 --> 00:42:33.640
And people are doing this a lot and let's do some of that.
Um,

661
00:42:33.790 --> 00:42:38.790
so I get to discover things like e ink who knew e ink,

662
00:42:40.150 --> 00:42:43.630
you know,
those little clear balls filled with,
um,

663
00:42:43.960 --> 00:42:46.810
charged particles.
Some are white and some are black.

664
00:42:47.410 --> 00:42:51.370
And how'd they get them in there?
That's what I want to know.

665
00:42:51.490 --> 00:42:53.740
And I couldn't find that out.
I couldn't figure it out.

666
00:42:53.741 --> 00:42:57.580
Nobody could tell me or would,
um,
I don't know whether that's,
uh,
you know,

667
00:42:58.120 --> 00:42:59.950
proprietary information or not.

668
00:43:00.100 --> 00:43:05.100
But if anybody here knows how you get charged black and white particles in a

669
00:43:05.800 --> 00:43:09.250
clear steer in liquid and liquid in a clear sphere,

670
00:43:09.251 --> 00:43:12.550
that's about the diameter of a human hair.
Um,

671
00:43:13.000 --> 00:43:17.890
let me know before I get,
you know,
I'm on my way out.
Just tell me.
Um,
I just,

672
00:43:17.891 --> 00:43:22.660
I can only envision little people,
really small people,
that tiny little hands.

673
00:43:22.661 --> 00:43:27.190
So,
um,
but so there's nothing magic to the,
to the choice,
honestly and no is no.

674
00:43:27.300 --> 00:43:31.750
Um,
I was going to say there's,
there's no sort of committee,
uh,

675
00:43:31.770 --> 00:43:34.480
that we don't try things in front of an audience versus say,
okay,

676
00:43:34.481 --> 00:43:35.860
let's include that.
I mean,

677
00:43:35.980 --> 00:43:40.980
you got a few tired people sitting around a table with lists of possibilities

678
00:43:41.770 --> 00:43:44.860
and just,
I think the trick is to just look around you.

679
00:43:45.900 --> 00:43:49.870
It would have been worse had we sort of over-thought that because then you run

680
00:43:49.871 --> 00:43:50.760
into the cha,

681
00:43:50.810 --> 00:43:55.000
the possibility of including things that really aren't that fun and certainly

682
00:43:55.001 --> 00:43:59.560
aren't taken for granted.
It's the stuff that we,
ourselves no longer see.

683
00:43:59.561 --> 00:44:02.200
We just reached for it.
We know where it is,
we know how to operate it.

684
00:44:02.370 --> 00:44:07.180
We also know that when it dies,
you throw it away and you just get another one.

685
00:44:07.630 --> 00:44:12.040
So that's it.
Common sense and just shared conversation,

686
00:44:12.770 --> 00:44:14.370
<v 8>calling on the eating thing.
Uh,</v>

687
00:44:14.450 --> 00:44:18.920
it seems like your technique is great for mechanical things,

688
00:44:18.921 --> 00:44:23.870
things that move and structural things,
but do you find that with more abstracts,

689
00:44:23.900 --> 00:44:26.960
digital things that don't move,

690
00:44:27.200 --> 00:44:29.330
is it more difficult to impossible.
Amen.

691
00:44:29.450 --> 00:44:33.270
<v 3>It's not more difficult.
It's almost,
I mean,
just dealing with electricity,</v>

692
00:44:33.570 --> 00:44:37.260
you know,
you're forced to,
um,
yeah.
What are your choices?

693
00:44:37.261 --> 00:44:40.800
You can do ready kilowatt with sneakers.
Um,

694
00:44:40.860 --> 00:44:42.210
and that worked for the electric company,

695
00:44:42.211 --> 00:44:46.850
I guess in the electric companies back in the 60s.
Um,

696
00:44:47.010 --> 00:44:49.810
the 1960s.
Uh,

697
00:44:51.210 --> 00:44:53.970
and there are arrows suggesting direction.

698
00:44:53.971 --> 00:44:58.710
I mean I hate it when I'm basically forced up against arrows.

699
00:44:58.860 --> 00:45:02.640
Um,
as the only way out metaphor becomes too,

700
00:45:03.000 --> 00:45:05.880
too risky because while it's fun to play with,

701
00:45:06.300 --> 00:45:09.660
it can become far more complicated than the thing you're trying to get across.

702
00:45:10.020 --> 00:45:11.220
Um,
you,
you,

703
00:45:11.221 --> 00:45:15.810
you certainly do end up promoting the notion that this is a complex thing in

704
00:45:15.811 --> 00:45:18.990
your metaphor,
but it may not make the information that,

705
00:45:19.260 --> 00:45:23.670
that you need to communicate any clearer.
So,
um,

706
00:45:26.160 --> 00:45:29.340
it is more difficult and the harder it is to see what's going on.

707
00:45:29.340 --> 00:45:32.910
I love mechanical things as a drawing in the new book of the,
um,

708
00:45:33.030 --> 00:45:36.890
the video game player controller.
Um,

709
00:45:37.230 --> 00:45:40.500
and my favorite part of it is a little piece under your thumbs,

710
00:45:40.740 --> 00:45:45.480
that little universal joint thing that allows your thumbs to do all that amazing

711
00:45:45.481 --> 00:45:47.400
stuff.
I,
that's one of the,

712
00:45:47.550 --> 00:45:51.720
the machines in which I was able to use the real thing because I have a now 17

713
00:45:51.721 --> 00:45:55.440
year old son,
but he's,
he was younger a little while ago,
and,
um,

714
00:45:56.010 --> 00:46:00.040
he's his W it's the order in which I like it actually.
Uh,

715
00:46:01.290 --> 00:46:02.790
he,
um,
you know,
he has,

716
00:46:03.090 --> 00:46:06.570
he has been known to have a little bit of a temper when he's playing these games

717
00:46:06.571 --> 00:46:10.920
and he's losing.
Um,
and,
and we keep telling him it's not that important.

718
00:46:10.921 --> 00:46:14.520
It's just the,
yeah.
So he has this bag of half damaged,

719
00:46:14.521 --> 00:46:18.450
half destroyed controllers that he's sort of been in the corner of his room

720
00:46:18.451 --> 00:46:21.960
forever.
So when I did research,
I just went up to Sanders Jose,
and I said,

721
00:46:21.961 --> 00:46:25.920
you mind if I have one of those controllers that pick 'em all,
um,

722
00:46:26.940 --> 00:46:29.640
and,
and,
and looking at that thing and taking it apart.

723
00:46:29.641 --> 00:46:32.220
And I drew it and I thought I understood it the first time I drove,

724
00:46:32.270 --> 00:46:36.290
I drove it again and I still didn't get it right.
Um,
so,
you know,
it's the,

725
00:46:36.291 --> 00:46:39.690
it's not just the way these things move and the way they're sort of hinge than

726
00:46:39.691 --> 00:46:39.960
one,

727
00:46:39.960 --> 00:46:43.830
but it's the way the material works to allow something to move in one direction.

728
00:46:43.831 --> 00:46:44.670
So it,
it,

729
00:46:44.690 --> 00:46:49.690
it is wonderfully complicated but visually rewarding because at the end of it

730
00:46:50.010 --> 00:46:52.950
you kind of have a sense of,
oh,
I see,
I get it.

731
00:46:52.980 --> 00:46:55.980
I understand how the pieces go together.
I understand how it works.

732
00:46:55.981 --> 00:46:57.570
Those are very satisfying moments.

733
00:46:57.810 --> 00:47:02.810
And whereas the rest of it is that Greenfield with all the little gray boxes and

734
00:47:03.190 --> 00:47:07.620
lots of little lines,
not easy,
not as easy to see as they used to be.

735
00:47:08.060 --> 00:47:11.730
Um,
a little blobs of silver.
A city basically does the city.

736
00:47:11.970 --> 00:47:16.400
And then there were these two big chunky stone age things on the side of the

737
00:47:16.710 --> 00:47:21.240
wonderful,
uh,
range of,
uh,
technical stuff.

738
00:47:21.480 --> 00:47:25.980
We still have to appeal to the farm and work with the foam even though this

739
00:47:25.981 --> 00:47:30.700
stuff doesn't care about the fum so much.
But these do,
and that's kind of Nice.

740
00:47:30.810 --> 00:47:33.910
And I think that's why I am drawing still to those,

741
00:47:34.540 --> 00:47:39.040
to those pieces of the larger contraption.
Thank you.
You're welcome.

742
00:47:39.380 --> 00:47:42.010
<v 9>I just also wanted to thank you for your books.
Uh,</v>

743
00:47:42.020 --> 00:47:44.600
I didn't get to be nearly as many of them at some of these people when I was a

744
00:47:44.601 --> 00:47:48.380
kid because my brother was fiercely protected,
but his copies,

745
00:47:48.381 --> 00:47:50.150
I literally had to sneak into his room.

746
00:47:50.151 --> 00:47:53.900
And so it's not until I've been a dad where I have people in my family to give

747
00:47:53.901 --> 00:47:55.940
me an excuse to go until the children's section,

748
00:47:55.941 --> 00:47:59.360
but I'm still bigger than them and can fight them off that I've gotten to

749
00:47:59.361 --> 00:48:00.440
actually catch up.
Uh,

750
00:48:00.441 --> 00:48:03.650
underground was just a couple of years ago they found me a real owner of the

751
00:48:03.651 --> 00:48:06.740
children's section when my wife wanted to leave.
It was like,
where is dad?

752
00:48:06.741 --> 00:48:08.720
And it turns out he was,
I was over there.

753
00:48:09.470 --> 00:48:10.620
<v 3>I'm good.
Thanks.</v>

754
00:48:11.740 --> 00:48:16.600
<v 9>And I'm curious if there's anything that you've been either now or in the past</v>

755
00:48:16.601 --> 00:48:19.660
it really wanted to explain.
It really ate away at Hsu,

756
00:48:19.661 --> 00:48:23.890
but it took a long time or a particular insight before you really felt like,

757
00:48:24.230 --> 00:48:28.090
you know,
something that just sat there for a while,
not just for a week or two,

758
00:48:28.091 --> 00:48:30.780
but maybe a year or two.
And you really finally broke through and

759
00:48:31.500 --> 00:48:36.090
<v 3>you just described the motivation behind doing the way we work and work on the</v>

760
00:48:36.091 --> 00:48:41.070
human body.
I was 55 and I knew nothing basically about how I work,
not see,

761
00:48:41.130 --> 00:48:45.480
I mean most,
most crudely fundamental stuff.
Um,

762
00:48:46.650 --> 00:48:51.510
and I thought,
I've got to,
I've got to figure this out.
And so I know,
you know,

763
00:48:51.511 --> 00:48:53.510
to justify it.
Um,

764
00:48:53.700 --> 00:48:58.050
this what turned out to be a six or seven year education,
um,

765
00:48:59.530 --> 00:49:03.120
that is to say,
to pay for it,
I had to make a book.
Uh,

766
00:49:03.510 --> 00:49:06.630
it's the hardest thing I've ever done.
Um,

767
00:49:06.990 --> 00:49:10.680
I think I made some progress.
You know,
I,
um,

768
00:49:12.210 --> 00:49:16.290
I knew I had a pancreas for instance.
I had no idea where it was.

769
00:49:16.980 --> 00:49:19.230
I knew it wasn't far,
but I didn't,

770
00:49:19.231 --> 00:49:22.200
I couldn't have told you and I couldn't have told you what it did,

771
00:49:22.740 --> 00:49:27.540
why it was important.
And so on,
having watched one removed during a,

772
00:49:27.630 --> 00:49:31.350
you know,
a stint at a,
in an emergency room,
uh,
none of them are.

773
00:49:31.430 --> 00:49:33.330
I'm an operating room.
Um,

774
00:49:33.690 --> 00:49:38.350
I have a very strong memory of,
of,
um,

775
00:49:38.460 --> 00:49:43.460
of this thing now and where it was because I saw the a cavity inflated with air,

776
00:49:44.240 --> 00:49:47.820
uh,
so that they could get in there and work around and all that sort of stuff.

777
00:49:47.850 --> 00:49:51.330
Watching it on the monitor,
seeing the person in front of me.
Um,

778
00:49:51.510 --> 00:49:56.510
that was the one where I was driven by guilt as much as anything,

779
00:49:57.541 --> 00:50:01.950
not just curiosity,
but guilt and curiosity,
what is going on inside me.

780
00:50:02.280 --> 00:50:06.690
And uh,
the funny thing about that day and the Orr was,

781
00:50:06.960 --> 00:50:08.400
um,
I got there,

782
00:50:08.620 --> 00:50:11.790
I like everybody does at six in the morning and you put on the scrubs and the

783
00:50:11.791 --> 00:50:12.330
whole thing.

784
00:50:12.330 --> 00:50:17.330
And I'm leaning up against the wall because the table is only like about there.

785
00:50:17.430 --> 00:50:20.430
So I'm back as far against the wall as I can.

786
00:50:20.790 --> 00:50:25.790
And after about two hours of this surgery and really getting hungry and it just

787
00:50:27.891 --> 00:50:29.390
seemed odd,

788
00:50:29.450 --> 00:50:33.560
but I was maybe a little cold in there and not cold but cool.

789
00:50:33.740 --> 00:50:35.450
So that may have had something to do with it.

790
00:50:35.690 --> 00:50:39.530
But then I realized I'm getting hungry because it smells like we're at a

791
00:50:39.531 --> 00:50:40.364
barbecue.

792
00:50:43.370 --> 00:50:46.820
Cauterizing anyone.
So,
um,
so the,
it'd be the,

793
00:50:46.970 --> 00:50:51.970
and it just filled the air with this really pleasant in a really gruesome

794
00:50:52.670 --> 00:50:54.050
setting.
So anyway,

795
00:50:54.140 --> 00:50:57.950
I'm learning all the time and seeing connections and relationships between

796
00:50:57.951 --> 00:51:02.120
things that,
um,
I don't normally reveal.
But anyway,
that was,

797
00:51:02.450 --> 00:51:05.720
that was the book.
Um,
in terms of future stuff,

798
00:51:05.750 --> 00:51:09.420
there's a lot of stuff I kind of liked to know about.
Um,

799
00:51:09.500 --> 00:51:12.020
there wasn't one at the top of the list.
Um,

800
00:51:12.140 --> 00:51:15.170
I'm finishing up a book now on the Sse United States,

801
00:51:15.530 --> 00:51:18.440
the fastest steam ship in the world.
And it's the one that brought us,

802
00:51:18.500 --> 00:51:22.500
my family and I to this country in 1957 from South Hampton,

803
00:51:22.501 --> 00:51:26.990
there was a 10 year old kid and I remember I'd never been so bored in my life.

804
00:51:27.290 --> 00:51:30.830
I'm on this amazing thing,
fastest,
um,

805
00:51:30.860 --> 00:51:35.860
spectacular navy built for the navy as well as for commercial use.

806
00:51:37.250 --> 00:51:38.083
And,
um,

807
00:51:38.780 --> 00:51:42.350
what I remember best is going to the movies because they were free as a kid

808
00:51:42.351 --> 00:51:45.830
coming from the north of England,
that was a huge deal.
Um,

809
00:51:46.010 --> 00:51:49.520
I went to the same movie three times a day for five days,
um,

810
00:51:49.850 --> 00:51:54.470
and I spent the rest of my time on deck looking for the Empire State building,

811
00:51:54.471 --> 00:51:58.070
which I was convinced I would be able to see

812
00:51:59.990 --> 00:52:04.070
as we passed the Ireland because it was really big.
Really.
So anyway,

813
00:52:04.280 --> 00:52:07.630
I'm finishing that now and then I really do have to entertain what you're,

814
00:52:07.631 --> 00:52:10.220
you know,
sort of the idea that you're talking about what's next,

815
00:52:10.580 --> 00:52:14.430
what is it that I think I can devote some time to and um,

816
00:52:14.870 --> 00:52:19.810
<v 10>you know,
learn and,
and so on.
Thank you.
Go ahead,</v>

817
00:52:21.690 --> 00:52:22.051
<v 1>David,</v>

818
00:52:22.051 --> 00:52:25.500
who you just spoke to mentioned underground that I wanted to also mention that

819
00:52:25.530 --> 00:52:28.050
as one of your books had the most impact on me.

820
00:52:28.051 --> 00:52:31.440
It actually gave me a physical sense of vertigo while reading it.
So well done.

821
00:52:31.530 --> 00:52:32.990
Good.
Thanks.
Um,

822
00:52:33.630 --> 00:52:38.130
and I wondered whether you thought about why you use drawing as a medium to

823
00:52:38.131 --> 00:52:39.510
communicate ideas to other people,

824
00:52:39.511 --> 00:52:43.410
but whether you've thought about talking about drawing itself,

825
00:52:43.530 --> 00:52:46.210
teaching people how to draw or just talking about you're the one way that use

826
00:52:46.260 --> 00:52:48.240
your own way that you see drawing.

827
00:52:48.700 --> 00:52:49.533
<v 3>Um,</v>

828
00:52:50.560 --> 00:52:54.670
for me it's one of the most satisfying things I can,
I can do,

829
00:52:54.880 --> 00:52:58.450
but it's really about connecting with the world around you.
Drawing for me,

830
00:52:58.570 --> 00:53:01.090
it's not,
I don't draw draw from,
um,

831
00:53:02.050 --> 00:53:04.180
sort of invent something and then start drawing it.
To me,

832
00:53:04.181 --> 00:53:08.230
that's sort of doodling.
Um,
I really liked to draw something,

833
00:53:08.770 --> 00:53:10.870
but something that I have to dismantle,

834
00:53:10.871 --> 00:53:13.150
even if I can't actually physically take it apart,

835
00:53:13.480 --> 00:53:17.020
I can dismantle it on the paper.
I can dismantle it while I'm drawing.

836
00:53:17.320 --> 00:53:22.320
And the use of a pencil or the fountain pen on tracing paper is the most,

837
00:53:24.150 --> 00:53:28.650
um,
it,
it was such a gentle relationship.
I mean there's,

838
00:53:28.740 --> 00:53:32.850
it's so soothing.
It's so,
it's wonderful to do it.
Um,

839
00:53:34.710 --> 00:53:36.630
and there's no preciousness.

840
00:53:36.840 --> 00:53:39.750
I'm not thinking of composition when I start drawing.

841
00:53:39.751 --> 00:53:44.100
I'm not thinking of how to arrange these things.
I'm simply letting this,

842
00:53:44.101 --> 00:53:48.990
completing this process of taking things in,
interpreting them in my brain,

843
00:53:48.991 --> 00:53:50.970
sending it down to my hand,
try and get,

844
00:53:51.000 --> 00:53:56.000
looking at that and seeing if that connects with what began the process and just

845
00:53:56.041 --> 00:54:00.860
this,
the cycle,
um,
is to me the great pleasure of,

846
00:54:00.900 --> 00:54:05.190
of drawing,
whether I'm recording outside,
enjoying nature,

847
00:54:05.970 --> 00:54:10.440
trying to figure out how to make that color look like that color on this piece

848
00:54:10.441 --> 00:54:15.210
of paper.
Um,
the challenges are there always,
but the,

849
00:54:15.240 --> 00:54:15.510
um,

850
00:54:15.510 --> 00:54:20.430
the kind of eye opening aspect of drawing is the thing that makes me keep

851
00:54:20.431 --> 00:54:24.240
wanting to do.
I do it every day,
um,
for at least some chunk of the day.

852
00:54:24.420 --> 00:54:28.920
And when the deadline is getting closer and closer,
I'm,
I'm drawing,
you know,

853
00:54:29.160 --> 00:54:31.330
day and half the night,
uh,

854
00:54:31.380 --> 00:54:36.030
as I will be for the next few months and it will lose some of its joy by the

855
00:54:36.031 --> 00:54:39.120
time we hit January.
I know that because I've done it before,

856
00:54:39.480 --> 00:54:44.480
but at the end I look back on it and I feel connected to the information in the

857
00:54:44.491 --> 00:54:49.491
book because of the way I have absorbed it and interpreted it and ultimately

858
00:54:50.730 --> 00:54:51.563
presented it.

859
00:54:52.510 --> 00:54:53.110
<v 6>Hi.
Uh,</v>

860
00:54:53.110 --> 00:54:58.110
one of the big differences between 1988 and now it's sort of the spread of the

861
00:54:58.451 --> 00:54:59.860
Internet,
that growth of the Internet,

862
00:54:59.890 --> 00:55:03.220
especially particularly thinking about Wikipedia and things like that.
Um,

863
00:55:03.250 --> 00:55:07.720
and one of the downsides of those is they,
they lack a lot of the curation,

864
00:55:08.140 --> 00:55:09.790
uh,
and the simplification.

865
00:55:10.350 --> 00:55:13.720
And it was just wondering what your thoughts were on like the universal

866
00:55:13.721 --> 00:55:17.890
accessibility of things like Wikipedia in your pocket as opposed to the way that

867
00:55:17.891 --> 00:55:22.891
you approached this book or did you find yourself trying to use that in creating

868
00:55:23.441 --> 00:55:27.010
the new edition of the book or did you find that you rather go to more

869
00:55:27.011 --> 00:55:27.844
traditional sources?

870
00:55:28.010 --> 00:55:32.910
<v 3>No,
no.
I would be crazy not to use it.
I mean it's an extraordinary tool.
And it,</v>

871
00:55:33.560 --> 00:55:37.220
it's interesting because why has this book still in print after,
after 30,

872
00:55:37.221 --> 00:55:41.060
almost 30 years when the Internet is,
um,

873
00:55:41.760 --> 00:55:44.450
has all this information,
it has all the facts,

874
00:55:45.860 --> 00:55:48.830
but it doesn't make me care about them.

875
00:55:48.920 --> 00:55:52.610
I simply know it's a terrific resource and I can look things up and I can find

876
00:55:52.611 --> 00:55:56.480
things and I can keep finding layers of things depending on what level of

877
00:55:56.481 --> 00:55:59.240
information I want.
But at the end of the day,

878
00:55:59.241 --> 00:56:01.880
I have to interpret what I've learned.

879
00:56:02.000 --> 00:56:04.250
And that's what I said earlier about being an editor.

880
00:56:04.520 --> 00:56:08.900
I have to decide what it is in this book with it's limited,
you know,

881
00:56:08.930 --> 00:56:12.320
format we can actually say and make clear.

882
00:56:12.500 --> 00:56:13.940
My goal is to,

883
00:56:14.060 --> 00:56:19.060
is to encourage curiosity in a way that would perhaps nudge you to the internet

884
00:56:20.960 --> 00:56:24.490
or some other source of information for more detail,

885
00:56:24.910 --> 00:56:29.020
but you would feel excited about it enough to do that.
Um,

886
00:56:29.800 --> 00:56:34.800
the difference between facts and information presented through basically what

887
00:56:36.191 --> 00:56:39.700
seems like one voice visually,
verbally.
It's,
I mean,

888
00:56:40.140 --> 00:56:44.620
all our work all comes together to create that book.
So it's a single voice.

889
00:56:44.800 --> 00:56:47.640
You're not seeing different things designed in different ways.

890
00:56:47.680 --> 00:56:49.900
You're not seeing ads,
you're not seeing any of that sort of stuff.

891
00:56:50.140 --> 00:56:51.100
No distractions.

892
00:56:51.130 --> 00:56:56.130
Just look at the page and stir an interest in the,

893
00:56:57.610 --> 00:57:01.870
in the,
in the information,
not expecting to answer all the questions about it,

894
00:57:01.871 --> 00:57:04.640
not even attempting to,
but sturdy interest in,

895
00:57:04.670 --> 00:57:08.890
star that curiosity and then go for it.

896
00:57:08.891 --> 00:57:12.200
Use the rest of the,
the world as your and,

897
00:57:12.280 --> 00:57:15.730
and all those other tools as your encyclopedia.

898
00:57:17.620 --> 00:57:18.820
All right.
Thanks.
Thanks very much.

899
00:57:19.040 --> 00:57:24.040
