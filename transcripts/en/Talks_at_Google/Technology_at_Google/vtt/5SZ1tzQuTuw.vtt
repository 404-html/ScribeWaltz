00:00:05.620 --> 00:00:10.620
[inaudible]

2
00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:14.150
<v 0>guys.
Um,
I'm really happy to be here.</v>

3
00:00:14.151 --> 00:00:17.180
Thanks to Dave and Company for uh,

4
00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:19.700
ushering me in hosting me so well,

5
00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:24.730
I often ask for the slot right before lunch because then I'm all powerful.

6
00:00:25.281 --> 00:00:28.980
I'm like what's between the audience and lunch?
Uh,
and it's,

7
00:00:28.981 --> 00:00:32.120
it's fun to play that game,
but I think most of us had lunch.
Uh,

8
00:00:32.121 --> 00:00:36.530
so I guess I'm between you and work,
so we should just linger as long as we can.

9
00:00:36.531 --> 00:00:39.020
And the Q and a.
Um,

10
00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:42.770
I thought I would just share a little bit about the book,

11
00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:44.360
how I came to the story,

12
00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:48.470
share a few passages from it and then get into a Q and a and sort of learn

13
00:00:48.471 --> 00:00:52.190
what's on your mind and have a kind of back and forth.

14
00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:57.700
So breaking and entering is the true story of a female hacker called alien and

15
00:01:01.041 --> 00:01:04.010
the birth of our information insecurity age.

16
00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:09.640
And I should make clear from the onset that alien is a white hat hacker.

17
00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:15.100
She is someone who is paid by big businesses and government agencies to try to

18
00:01:16.611 --> 00:01:21.590
break into them in order to see how they can be broken into.
Uh,

19
00:01:21.650 --> 00:01:26.650
she also does recovery work if someone has already been breached coming in,

20
00:01:27.261 --> 00:01:31.700
doing forensics,
uh,
and other kinds of analysis to figure out what happened,

21
00:01:31.701 --> 00:01:33.140
how to recover and why.

22
00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:38.830
And she also does a variety of other things such as digital hostage situations

23
00:01:40.491 --> 00:01:42.590
and kind of ransomware cases.
For example,

24
00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:47.570
where you've got 24 hours to have your hospital system or law firm or tech

25
00:01:47.571 --> 00:01:51.530
company.
I get the data that has been compromised back,

26
00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:56.150
uh,
and you have to pay $200,000 in Bitcoin and she kind of answers,

27
00:01:56.151 --> 00:02:00.140
is that true?
Is there another way to get it out?
Uh,

28
00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:04.880
if you do want to pay $200,000 in Bitcoin,
how do you do that,
uh,

29
00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:06.350
in the next few hours?

30
00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:11.360
How do you do that without getting triple infected on the way back?
Um,
she,

31
00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:12.441
ah,
we'll,

32
00:02:12.441 --> 00:02:15.590
we'll talk more about that and sorta end of my talk as I get to that end of her

33
00:02:15.591 --> 00:02:20.300
career.
But I want to go back a bit.
So,

34
00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:25.040
um,
I guess I want to just get a sense of the room.

35
00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:29.540
Uh,
is anyone here or who here is,

36
00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:33.770
I know there's a lot of different teams.
Who here is insecurity in some ways?

37
00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:38.960
Okay.
So I think I got about 15 or so.
Have you.

38
00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:44.050
Um,
so that means there's like 30 people insecurity and 15 are,
are,

39
00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:48.140
are admitting it.
Um,
I've learned,
I've learned the math.
Um,

40
00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:52.490
and I guess on the flip side,
is anyone here,

41
00:02:52.491 --> 00:02:56.450
I won't make you tell the gory details.
Is anyone here,
uh,

42
00:02:56.540 --> 00:02:57.500
been hacked?

43
00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:00.340
<v 1>Okay.</v>

44
00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:02.500
<v 0>So I don't see any hands.</v>

45
00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:07.560
So as the 15 people who did raise their hand could tell you that means like 40

46
00:03:08.321 --> 00:03:12.370
of you have been hacked,
I guess 10 have you have,
you know it,

47
00:03:12.371 --> 00:03:15.310
you don't want to admit it.
That's okay.
And you know,

48
00:03:15.311 --> 00:03:18.650
we can multiply that by four.
So then,
you know,
that's another 40 of you have.

49
00:03:18.651 --> 00:03:20.970
And I guess just don't know it yet.
Um,

50
00:03:21.850 --> 00:03:25.210
has anyone ever been targeted,

51
00:03:26.130 --> 00:03:28.450
uh,
by a hacker?

52
00:03:28.451 --> 00:03:32.560
Have you ever like gotten an email that might not have been from the person who

53
00:03:32.561 --> 00:03:33.520
said it was,

54
00:03:33.580 --> 00:03:37.060
there might've been a link if you clicked on it and it was a bad idea and he

55
00:03:37.061 --> 00:03:41.500
made you all carry some special device from now on to do anything at work
anyway.

56
00:03:42.540 --> 00:03:47.080
Uh,
yeah.
Has anyone ever got a,
I got a call on Monday from the help desk,

57
00:03:47.490 --> 00:03:49.350
have you ever,
right.
Um,

58
00:03:50.020 --> 00:03:53.980
or it can be face to face and we'll talk about some circumstances like that too.

59
00:03:54.070 --> 00:03:58.720
So that is basically all of us are targeted every day,
all the time.

60
00:03:59.470 --> 00:04:04.470
And so we're in an interesting situation where hacking is now a field where

61
00:04:08.740 --> 00:04:12.130
everyone,
not just at Google,
but it's pretty well aware of it,
um,

62
00:04:12.250 --> 00:04:17.250
from little kids to great grandmothers and all of us are targeted.

63
00:04:17.351 --> 00:04:22.351
And we know that hackers have an outsized influence on parts of our economy,

64
00:04:22.870 --> 00:04:27.460
on our politics,
uh,
on our culture.

65
00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:31.270
But we'd still,
for the most part,

66
00:04:31.271 --> 00:04:35.410
if you ask people what does a hacker look like,
they don't have a face.

67
00:04:36.010 --> 00:04:40.960
So,
uh,
maybe they pop up a popular search engine.
Uh,

68
00:04:40.961 --> 00:04:45.850
if you do an image search,
uh,
for hacker,
Gosh,

69
00:04:46.210 --> 00:04:49.590
you get literally no faces.
I,

70
00:04:49.591 --> 00:04:54.010
you get shadowed figures and hoodies or occasional guy Fawkes masks.

71
00:04:54.340 --> 00:04:58.720
But don't worry,
you know,
I'm sure the fourth search result,
no,

72
00:04:58.721 --> 00:05:03.550
the fifth,
the 20th,
the 400th,
um,
it just goes on and on.

73
00:05:03.840 --> 00:05:07.630
Uh,
there are no faces,
uh,
to this field,

74
00:05:07.930 --> 00:05:10.900
even though it is so integral to,
you know,

75
00:05:10.901 --> 00:05:13.810
we're all thinking about it more and more often to newspaper every day.

76
00:05:14.380 --> 00:05:19.000
So as a writer,
that's an incredible opportunity,
right?
Can I tell the story?

77
00:05:19.001 --> 00:05:23.710
Can I show the face?
Can I show the field growing up?
Uh,

78
00:05:23.740 --> 00:05:25.990
you wouldn't necessarily know it by the cover of my book.

79
00:05:25.991 --> 00:05:27.560
It's not that different.
But you know,

80
00:05:27.580 --> 00:05:30.760
I'm wedded to the world that your search engine results have created.

81
00:05:30.761 --> 00:05:34.000
And so if I want to signal that it's a book about a hacker,

82
00:05:34.001 --> 00:05:37.360
I've got to have a shadowy figure,
um,
with ones and Zeros.

83
00:05:37.361 --> 00:05:39.190
But inside I try to put a face on the top.

84
00:05:40.360 --> 00:05:43.000
So how did I come to the story?

85
00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:47.800
How did I get this chance to kind of follow,
um,
hacking over the last 20 years?

86
00:05:47.801 --> 00:05:52.750
Because if you think about it,
even when we have a face,
that face is like 30,

87
00:05:52.751 --> 00:05:57.250
40 years old at this point,
it's like Matthew Broderick in war games,
uh,

88
00:05:57.540 --> 00:06:00.470
or Angelina Jolie and hackers.
Um,

89
00:06:00.471 --> 00:06:03.830
so it's an incredible opportunity.

90
00:06:03.831 --> 00:06:06.840
So did I just start following people with hoodies,
uh,

91
00:06:06.860 --> 00:06:11.500
down alleyways until I found someone going into the dark web,
uh,

92
00:06:11.630 --> 00:06:13.640
before the Sanford,
whatever the FBI could,

93
00:06:13.670 --> 00:06:18.080
could trap them in a San Francisco public library.
Um,
I didn't,

94
00:06:18.800 --> 00:06:23.150
I found this story through an alternate investigative journalism.
Nothing.

95
00:06:23.660 --> 00:06:26.660
I picked my daughter up from preschool,

96
00:06:27.750 --> 00:06:31.530
so I went to pick her off and there was a new classmate they were playing

97
00:06:31.531 --> 00:06:33.390
together with the girls ran off to the playground.

98
00:06:33.420 --> 00:06:35.220
If you ever have like five year olds,

99
00:06:35.221 --> 00:06:39.250
you know that the best babysitter for a five year old is a five a,

100
00:06:39.330 --> 00:06:42.660
they kind of cancel each other out and they,
they occupy each other.

101
00:06:42.960 --> 00:06:45.840
It's like mutually assured something.
Ah,

102
00:06:46.530 --> 00:06:50.490
so I'm talking to the mom and she says,

103
00:06:51.120 --> 00:06:55.260
Hey,
you know what,
what do you do?
And I think that this is going to be great.

104
00:06:55.290 --> 00:06:59.460
I'm going to be the interesting person in this conversation.
I'm a writer.

105
00:06:59.461 --> 00:07:00.870
I write these books,

106
00:07:00.871 --> 00:07:05.070
I write these articles and I talk about myself for 10 minutes.

107
00:07:05.280 --> 00:07:10.200
Um,
and to be polite,
I say,

108
00:07:10.260 --> 00:07:14.640
uh,
you know,
what about you?
What do you do?
And she says,

109
00:07:14.641 --> 00:07:17.910
well,
tomorrow I have to break into a bank.

110
00:07:19.350 --> 00:07:20.970
And I realized,
Oh,

111
00:07:22.050 --> 00:07:25.680
I'm not the interesting person in this conversation.

112
00:07:25.830 --> 00:07:29.310
And that led to a longer series of conversations and I found out,
yeah,

113
00:07:29.311 --> 00:07:33.080
there's this one whole field that's a real,
uh,

114
00:07:33.090 --> 00:07:36.820
and this whole profession that's grown up over the last 20 years as I described

115
00:07:36.821 --> 00:07:39.670
to you at the beginning of people who are,

116
00:07:39.910 --> 00:07:44.910
have the same skills as the bad guys and do the same activities in a high end,

117
00:07:45.191 --> 00:07:47.830
professional,
organized way.
But do it under contract.

118
00:07:47.831 --> 00:07:51.700
You pay them big bucks for the privilege of having them try to break into you

119
00:07:51.940 --> 00:07:55.770
and hopefully you get them to do it before,
uh,

120
00:07:55.780 --> 00:07:59.440
you've been broken into already by a more malicious actor.

121
00:08:00.250 --> 00:08:05.200
So as I follow her story and heard more about it,

122
00:08:05.201 --> 00:08:08.590
I got really excited because even in the field of hacking,

123
00:08:08.591 --> 00:08:12.760
people tend to specialize.
You get car hacker's,
you get elevator hackers,

124
00:08:12.970 --> 00:08:17.890
you get people working in a particular operating system or mobile phone

125
00:08:17.891 --> 00:08:22.860
operating system or particular network vulnerability.
Um,

126
00:08:23.200 --> 00:08:28.200
but alien had gone through a huge variety of worlds and her career,

127
00:08:28.901 --> 00:08:33.160
if you will,
it didn't start as a,
it started as a sort of fun activity,

128
00:08:33.400 --> 00:08:36.670
um,
had grown up at the same time this profession had.

129
00:08:37.210 --> 00:08:39.070
So in following her story,

130
00:08:39.071 --> 00:08:43.330
I could follow hackings growth from this sort of skateboarding like subculture

131
00:08:43.840 --> 00:08:44.531
to what's now,

132
00:08:44.531 --> 00:08:49.531
I think $140 billion cybersecurity industry and not just a large and valuable

133
00:08:50.081 --> 00:08:50.950
industry,

134
00:08:51.220 --> 00:08:55.710
but one that touches every aspect of our lives and gives us insight every aspect

135
00:08:55.711 --> 00:08:59.730
of our life.
So the hope was if I can follow a hacker in her footsteps,

136
00:09:00.410 --> 00:09:03.900
a readers can do the same and you don't,
it's not just what you know,

137
00:09:03.901 --> 00:09:06.780
reading about it,
uh,
or learning about it.

138
00:09:06.781 --> 00:09:09.750
It's also you'll experience it yourself and kind of understand our

139
00:09:09.751 --> 00:09:13.140
vulnerabilities or our capabilities in a new way.

140
00:09:14.370 --> 00:09:19.370
So I want to share a few passages to illustrate some of the breadth of her

141
00:09:19.501 --> 00:09:24.120
world.
Uh,
one I won't share just for time reasons is the beginning.

142
00:09:25.280 --> 00:09:28.650
Uh,
she started as a 17 year old at MIT.

143
00:09:28.680 --> 00:09:32.490
Do we have any MIT grads here?

144
00:09:32.800 --> 00:09:37.260
You got at least one?
Uh,
two?
Yeah.

145
00:09:37.290 --> 00:09:39.360
Anyone do a course 19.

146
00:09:41.940 --> 00:09:46.200
I got to smile and I got a puzzled look.
So at MIT majors are called courses.

147
00:09:46.800 --> 00:09:50.700
So what,
what was,
what was the name of your number?
What was the,

148
00:09:51.090 --> 00:09:55.500
what was your course?
Of course 18,
which is what of course,

149
00:09:55.501 --> 00:09:59.100
18 math.
What was your course?
Of course six.
Three,

150
00:09:59.101 --> 00:10:01.890
which was computer science.
Okay.

151
00:10:02.400 --> 00:10:07.350
So they're numbered and they go up to like 24.
19 is not an assigned number.

152
00:10:07.410 --> 00:10:11.490
There is no designated course.
19 but unofficially,

153
00:10:12.130 --> 00:10:12.871
of course,

154
00:10:12.871 --> 00:10:17.340
19 is hacking and hacking at MIT predates computers.

155
00:10:17.341 --> 00:10:20.640
It does not directly refer to computers at all.

156
00:10:20.670 --> 00:10:23.580
It refers to physical exploration.

157
00:10:24.120 --> 00:10:27.120
So I was familiar with part of this tradition.

158
00:10:27.150 --> 00:10:31.470
There's this tradition of elaborate in genius physical pranks,

159
00:10:31.680 --> 00:10:36.600
like getting a police car on top of the Dome at Mit,

160
00:10:37.140 --> 00:10:41.310
uh,
or having a complete living room set couch,
you know,
um,

161
00:10:41.700 --> 00:10:46.560
liquor cabinet,
even a cat,
a newspaper,
a upside down,

162
00:10:46.740 --> 00:10:48.720
uh,
on the,
uh,

163
00:10:48.750 --> 00:10:53.610
arch outside the media lab at MIT or working tetris game that's playable on the

164
00:10:53.611 --> 00:10:55.710
windows of the tallest building on campus.

165
00:10:56.550 --> 00:10:59.880
And I was familiar with these hacks,
but it wasn't,

166
00:11:00.030 --> 00:11:03.630
I didn't think about the foundational skills needed to do that.

167
00:11:03.930 --> 00:11:06.510
You don't just kind of get up at,
you know,

168
00:11:06.810 --> 00:11:10.830
noon or eight or nine at night and said to your buddies,
hey,

169
00:11:10.831 --> 00:11:13.410
we should put a police car on the dome.
Maybe you do that,

170
00:11:13.500 --> 00:11:17.040
but you're not going to pull it off.
You've got to be able to pick locks,

171
00:11:17.220 --> 00:11:20.280
sneak past security guards,
climb on ledges,

172
00:11:21.480 --> 00:11:24.090
disassemble and assemble a car.

173
00:11:24.540 --> 00:11:26.490
You've got to be able to do that in the dark.

174
00:11:26.790 --> 00:11:29.010
You've got to be able to do that with a small group of people.

175
00:11:29.011 --> 00:11:32.340
You can really trust to keep a secret and you've got to be able to get in and

176
00:11:32.341 --> 00:11:35.250
out.
Uh,
and the same thing with the tetris game.

177
00:11:35.251 --> 00:11:37.200
The same thing with the living room set.

178
00:11:37.290 --> 00:11:42.290
The same thing with all these other hacks and there is pulling up a hack is the

179
00:11:44.160 --> 00:11:49.100
what I just described,
but going happiness,
totally different.
You're exploring,
uh,

180
00:11:49.170 --> 00:11:51.900
for the sake of exploring.
You're going through steam tunnels,

181
00:11:51.970 --> 00:11:55.150
you're going along ledges,
you're climbing up elevator shafts,

182
00:11:55.270 --> 00:12:00.270
you're finding hidden or unused spaces inside of the buildings that everyone

183
00:12:01.271 --> 00:12:05.260
else takes for granted and sort of goes through as a,
a normal civilian.

184
00:12:05.860 --> 00:12:09.850
And that's exciting.
It's perilous.
Um,

185
00:12:09.880 --> 00:12:14.050
and it has this direct analog to computer hacking.
You know,

186
00:12:14.051 --> 00:12:17.770
where you're also getting into forbidden spaces.
You're also,
um,

187
00:12:18.790 --> 00:12:22.390
working off label with what somebody else has created.

188
00:12:22.420 --> 00:12:26.290
If an inventor creates something new and an engineer builds to Spec a Hector

189
00:12:26.380 --> 00:12:30.410
creates something new with something someone else has built to Spec.
Um,

190
00:12:30.411 --> 00:12:34.060
so you're often knowing spaces in a way that the creator themselves didn't.

191
00:12:34.510 --> 00:12:37.450
And that's a direct analog to computer hacking.

192
00:12:37.451 --> 00:12:42.451
We know today she goes from that world into computer security as it's becoming a

193
00:12:42.521 --> 00:12:43.354
new field.

194
00:12:43.780 --> 00:12:48.780
And I thought I'd read a short passage from a section where she is working in

195
00:12:48.911 --> 00:12:53.080
information security.
It's about 2005 in a hospital system,

196
00:12:53.081 --> 00:12:58.000
one of the largest hospitals in the country.
We're aware,
especially now,

197
00:12:58.090 --> 00:12:58.641
uh,

198
00:12:58.641 --> 00:13:03.641
that everything that is a computer can be hacked and that everything is a

199
00:13:03.791 --> 00:13:08.770
computer,
but it still is different to know that,

200
00:13:08.890 --> 00:13:13.420
uh,
and to experience it firsthand.
So for example,

201
00:13:13.570 --> 00:13:17.560
in a hospital you're connected on average when you're in a hospital bed to about

202
00:13:17.561 --> 00:13:21.850
11 different medical devices,
those Evan Network card,

203
00:13:21.851 --> 00:13:25.990
usually those have an operating system.
It's usually built on windows,

204
00:13:26.290 --> 00:13:29.200
uh,
maybe a little more units in the past.
Hey,

205
00:13:29.201 --> 00:13:32.710
maybe a chrome or uh,
you know stuff right now.

206
00:13:33.340 --> 00:13:37.360
And that means it's going to have the same vulnerabilities that those systems

207
00:13:37.361 --> 00:13:38.194
have.

208
00:13:38.860 --> 00:13:43.860
Hospital equipment is also often bought on a 15 to 20 year time cycle because

209
00:13:44.021 --> 00:13:45.160
it's millions of dollars.

210
00:13:45.580 --> 00:13:49.210
And so that means when you go to the hospital in 2019,

211
00:13:49.750 --> 00:13:54.130
you may be experiencing a systems that are serving you,

212
00:13:54.131 --> 00:13:59.131
that have the vulnerabilities of 2004 or 1999.

213
00:13:59.740 --> 00:14:04.180
Uh,
but don't worry,
we will have the security we have today,
uh,

214
00:14:04.181 --> 00:14:06.400
in just 15 to 20 years.
Uh,

215
00:14:06.401 --> 00:14:10.900
so your grandchildren will have the secure systems.
Uh,

216
00:14:10.901 --> 00:14:15.901
so looking at trying to protect that and what that looks like was really

217
00:14:16.541 --> 00:14:19.750
interesting and trying to recreate that through her experiences going on site,

218
00:14:19.751 --> 00:14:21.280
talking to her old bosses and colleagues.

219
00:14:21.760 --> 00:14:26.500
And I thought I'd share a bit from that.
So what happens is,

220
00:14:26.980 --> 00:14:27.813
um,

221
00:14:28.810 --> 00:14:32.260
she gets a call from the network team at the hospital and they're having a

222
00:14:32.261 --> 00:14:36.100
bandwidth issue.
Something is a clogging the network.

223
00:14:36.101 --> 00:14:40.000
And so devices aren't able to communicate and some of them are shutting off.

224
00:14:40.030 --> 00:14:44.290
And that's a crisis in a situation where the flow of data is literally matter of

225
00:14:44.291 --> 00:14:47.800
life and death.
And people need to be able to contact each other across wards,

226
00:14:47.950 --> 00:14:51.470
transfer information.
And the devices themselves are lifesaving.

227
00:14:53.150 --> 00:14:57.440
<v 2>She goes to the office of her colleague,
Amy,
on the network team.</v>

228
00:14:59.540 --> 00:15:01.100
Amy was a Linkee Brunette,

229
00:15:01.490 --> 00:15:05.390
27 or 28 dressed in jeans and a teal pullover.

230
00:15:06.150 --> 00:15:10.520
Alien Knelt beside her inner cubicle as they studied network traffic information

231
00:15:10.760 --> 00:15:12.950
from Internet addresses across the hospital.

232
00:15:13.820 --> 00:15:17.780
We started getting calls two or three hours ago saying the Internet was slow.

233
00:15:17.781 --> 00:15:20.930
Amy told her I checked it out and they're right.

234
00:15:21.170 --> 00:15:24.230
Some internal address is just spewing traffic.

235
00:15:25.700 --> 00:15:29.390
It's gotta be a worm.
Alien said,
can you shut off the port?

236
00:15:30.290 --> 00:15:33.320
I could,
but I don't know what's plugged into it.
Amy said,

237
00:15:33.680 --> 00:15:37.070
what if it's an important machine?
I don't want to just cut it off.

238
00:15:38.180 --> 00:15:38.931
Let me see.

239
00:15:38.931 --> 00:15:42.860
Alien said she stepped up to the keyboard and scrolled back through Amy's

240
00:15:42.861 --> 00:15:45.890
command history,
double checking her investigation.

241
00:15:46.610 --> 00:15:50.150
Amy was a pro though on the basis of the Internet address alone.

242
00:15:50.180 --> 00:15:54.680
The closest they could do was trace the worms origin point to a third floor

243
00:15:54.681 --> 00:15:59.600
hallway in the same building that held the Er aliens.

244
00:15:59.630 --> 00:16:02.870
Eyes narrowed.
Stay here,
I'll find it.

245
00:16:02.930 --> 00:16:06.170
She said alien ran the elevator,

246
00:16:06.200 --> 00:16:11.090
popped outside and cut diagonally across the campus.
Seven minutes later,

247
00:16:11.120 --> 00:16:14.840
wide sliding doors separated for her at the entrance to the Er,

248
00:16:15.980 --> 00:16:20.780
Amy had called ahead for backup and it staff are assigned to this building.

249
00:16:20.810 --> 00:16:24.860
Met Alien at the third floor hallway and showed her to the right network switch.

250
00:16:25.430 --> 00:16:28.880
It serviced a long quiet hallway.
By now.

251
00:16:28.881 --> 00:16:31.070
Alien had burned almost half an hour,

252
00:16:31.640 --> 00:16:35.420
but she was getting closer back out on the hallway.

253
00:16:35.450 --> 00:16:38.090
Alien stopped in front of the only door in sight.

254
00:16:38.720 --> 00:16:43.720
Doctors and nurses swished past alien stepped back feeling out of place without

255
00:16:43.991 --> 00:16:47.960
a white coat or scrubs.
When a nurse slowed before the door,

256
00:16:47.961 --> 00:16:52.610
however alien flagged her down.
Hi,
I'm from it.

257
00:16:52.611 --> 00:16:57.290
Security,
she said,
and showed her badge.
I need to get in here.
Oh,

258
00:16:57.620 --> 00:17:00.230
the nurse swiped her own badge and the door clicked open.

259
00:17:00.890 --> 00:17:04.700
I'll have to accompany you.
She's warned.
This is a restricted area.

260
00:17:05.960 --> 00:17:10.910
The room was warm and dark and we could make out a few rows of what appeared to

261
00:17:10.911 --> 00:17:15.590
be high narrow carts on wheels,
each with a monitor nearby.

262
00:17:16.400 --> 00:17:18.650
It was vaguely reminiscent of a server room,

263
00:17:19.490 --> 00:17:23.960
but her entire concern was with the network ports located close to the floor.

264
00:17:25.040 --> 00:17:29.510
Alien dropped to a crawl using the same mag lights you'd had since her freshman

265
00:17:29.510 --> 00:17:34.100
year at Mit.
She swept the walls looking for the guilty court.

266
00:17:36.020 --> 00:17:40.940
20 seconds past 40 60 finally,

267
00:17:40.941 --> 00:17:45.200
aliens beam illuminated a yellow plastic port cover to which someone with a

268
00:17:45.201 --> 00:17:49.560
label maker had attached the Alpha numeric name of the infected machine.

269
00:17:50.730 --> 00:17:53.100
Alien smiled and triumph and relief.

270
00:17:53.850 --> 00:17:58.140
She used the MAG light to trace the black ethernet cord coming out of the port.

271
00:17:58.890 --> 00:18:03.210
It led to a profusion of other plugs and cables entering the back of the machine

272
00:18:03.211 --> 00:18:07.830
closest to her she'd page Amy and Amy would alert their bosses.

273
00:18:08.160 --> 00:18:12.030
They'd get the problem diagnosed as soon as possible before the machine is

274
00:18:12.031 --> 00:18:15.840
infected.
Anything further,
alien stood up.

275
00:18:16.500 --> 00:18:20.040
She gave up the nurse touching her back gently to get her attention without

276
00:18:20.041 --> 00:18:24.780
speaking.
Turn that flashlight off please.
She asked,

277
00:18:24.781 --> 00:18:28.950
and a low,
but from whisper it was more a command than a request.

278
00:18:30.270 --> 00:18:34.290
Alien obeyed.
She felt a sense of alarm,
even dread,

279
00:18:34.890 --> 00:18:37.500
and she'd done something wrong.
We're worthy.

280
00:18:38.220 --> 00:18:42.210
There weren't any patients in this room.
She had thought it had no beds,

281
00:18:42.240 --> 00:18:47.070
only more machines like this one per census suddenly heightened.
However,

282
00:18:47.250 --> 00:18:52.250
she now heard the sound of slow breathing all around her for the first time

283
00:18:52.590 --> 00:18:55.800
since their eyes became accustomed to the dark alien.

284
00:18:55.801 --> 00:19:00.801
Took a look around the room on each of the wheeled stands was a teeny palette

285
00:19:01.170 --> 00:19:03.300
enclosed by clear plastic.

286
00:19:04.190 --> 00:19:09.190
The Palette she saw now held teeny blankets and under each blanket was a baby,

287
00:19:10.650 --> 00:19:14.640
a teeny one sprawled out on its back and head turned to one side.

288
00:19:14.700 --> 00:19:15.750
All wired up.

289
00:19:16.560 --> 00:19:20.040
These newborns were essentially on life support and fast asleep.

290
00:19:21.090 --> 00:19:25.680
The room might resemble a server room alien realized,
but it wasn't.

291
00:19:26.460 --> 00:19:30.000
It was the Nicu,
the neonatal intensive care unit,

292
00:19:30.990 --> 00:19:33.390
babies she said to herself.

293
00:19:35.320 --> 00:19:39.850
<v 0>So experiences like that or eye opening because you realize,</v>

294
00:19:39.910 --> 00:19:42.070
uh,
you know,
the virus,
the worm,

295
00:19:42.071 --> 00:19:46.930
the other vulnerability can be a life support system.
Uh,
for,

296
00:19:47.020 --> 00:19:50.980
you know,
a cluster of kids that's not a port you want to pull,
uh,

297
00:19:51.010 --> 00:19:55.210
right away from her work in security.

298
00:19:55.211 --> 00:19:58.180
She moves to kind of the other side of the fence.

299
00:19:58.210 --> 00:20:02.320
And this was fun for me because it was the intersection of these two worlds,

300
00:20:02.321 --> 00:20:06.640
this physical breaking and entering she had done as an undergraduate and the

301
00:20:06.641 --> 00:20:07.810
computer security work.

302
00:20:08.230 --> 00:20:13.230
She gets hired as a penetration tester or a pen tester,

303
00:20:14.110 --> 00:20:19.000
uh,
testing security,
uh,
at fortune 500 companies,

304
00:20:19.030 --> 00:20:22.420
government agencies around the country and around the world.

305
00:20:22.930 --> 00:20:27.350
And I thought I'd share a short passage from,
uh,

306
00:20:27.430 --> 00:20:28.720
her first day at work.

307
00:20:28.900 --> 00:20:32.230
We can all just think about what our first day of work was or our first day of

308
00:20:32.231 --> 00:20:36.430
work at this campus.
Uh,
kind of onboarding process.

309
00:20:36.431 --> 00:20:40.330
What was the first task you had to do?
The kind of nervousness there.

310
00:20:40.590 --> 00:20:44.400
<v 2>And then think about this as your first day of work in a,</v>

311
00:20:44.430 --> 00:20:46.230
in a sort of new opportunity.

312
00:20:49.360 --> 00:20:52.720
Ted Roberts,
castle banks,
head of security,

313
00:20:52.780 --> 00:20:55.300
requested a private booth at the hotel restaurant,

314
00:20:56.290 --> 00:20:59.170
a friendly blonde 40 year old man in a business suit.

315
00:20:59.260 --> 00:21:03.430
He leaned across the table after dinner and pass both Richard and alien his

316
00:21:03.431 --> 00:21:08.431
business card and assigned one page note alien skim the document which she had

317
00:21:09.881 --> 00:21:13.300
written and sent to Ted asking him to fill in the blanks and bring it to their

318
00:21:13.301 --> 00:21:14.134
meeting tonight.

319
00:21:14.920 --> 00:21:19.720
Castle Bank has hired a lead defense to perform physical security penetration

320
00:21:19.721 --> 00:21:23.200
tests and assessments of nine sites in three states.

321
00:21:23.201 --> 00:21:28.000
It said specific addresses followed starting here with the banks or regional

322
00:21:28.001 --> 00:21:29.860
headquarters and four branches.

323
00:21:29.890 --> 00:21:34.750
She and Richard had driven by today doing local reconnaissance for the rest of

324
00:21:34.751 --> 00:21:36.670
the week.
Ted's note authorized.

325
00:21:36.820 --> 00:21:41.560
They were to probe the facilities one by one to determine if an uninvited

326
00:21:41.561 --> 00:21:44.200
visitor could enter,
explore,

327
00:21:44.260 --> 00:21:47.560
remove equipment or data or rob the banks.

328
00:21:48.070 --> 00:21:52.720
The letter closed with instructions on how to contact Ted if they got caught

329
00:21:53.590 --> 00:21:55.420
your get out of jail.
Free letter.

330
00:21:55.600 --> 00:22:00.600
He said Richard Herano but alien gave her best smile folding the letter in

331
00:22:01.241 --> 00:22:06.100
policing at inner coat pocket.
Thanks.
She said patting the pocket afterward.

332
00:22:06.580 --> 00:22:10.450
I hope we won't need it.
Ted Signal to a waiter for the check.

333
00:22:11.440 --> 00:22:14.710
Good luck,
but not too much luck.
He said

334
00:22:16.270 --> 00:22:17.170
Tuesday,
noon,

335
00:22:17.290 --> 00:22:22.030
the clock told an office workers exited the 20 story headquarters.

336
00:22:22.450 --> 00:22:25.690
Everyone was bundled up and breathing out steam on their way to lunch,

337
00:22:26.260 --> 00:22:27.790
moving in the opposite direction.

338
00:22:27.850 --> 00:22:32.200
Richard entered the lobby to check it out and we can watch from the front

339
00:22:32.201 --> 00:22:36.280
passenger seat of the car clutching an empty black laptop case.

340
00:22:37.000 --> 00:22:40.240
No,
not completely empty while she waited,

341
00:22:40.241 --> 00:22:44.590
alien reached her fingers into the zippered pocket and checked there.

342
00:22:44.591 --> 00:22:47.410
They were beside her get out of jail.
Free letter,

343
00:22:47.890 --> 00:22:51.490
fake business cards she'd printed after dinner with Ted last night.

344
00:22:52.510 --> 00:22:56.050
Elizabeth Testament enterprise technology specialist.

345
00:22:56.080 --> 00:23:01.080
They said right of the Red Castle Bank logo above her real cell phone number of

346
00:23:01.091 --> 00:23:05.200
fake castle corporate email address and the address of this building.

347
00:23:05.590 --> 00:23:10.590
Each element copied from Ted's business card and only inside shifting

348
00:23:10.961 --> 00:23:14.890
impatiently.
Then she sat up quickly seeing Richard approached the car.

349
00:23:15.640 --> 00:23:19.270
Did you get in alien asked after he had taken his seat and shut the door.

350
00:23:20.020 --> 00:23:24.970
Richard responded scornfully there's no way he reported.
What do you mean?

351
00:23:24.971 --> 00:23:27.670
She said I'll leave done was try the lobby.

352
00:23:27.910 --> 00:23:31.180
What about the freight elevator or the storage room of the open window?

353
00:23:31.570 --> 00:23:33.760
What happened?
Forget it.

354
00:23:34.300 --> 00:23:36.970
Richard turned up the heat or and made to shift the car into drive.

355
00:23:37.660 --> 00:23:41.950
It's freezing.
He said,
let's move.
We can totally do this.

356
00:23:42.190 --> 00:23:46.730
Alien unbuckled her seatbelt met me try and she said,
Richard shook his head.

357
00:23:47.240 --> 00:23:48.080
You won't get in.

358
00:23:48.081 --> 00:23:51.440
He insisted there are turnstiles in a security guard watching everything.

359
00:23:51.770 --> 00:23:54.800
It'll just blow our cover.
He continued gruffly.

360
00:23:55.190 --> 00:23:59.330
Let's try the bank branches first.
If there's time,
we'll come back here.

361
00:23:59.390 --> 00:24:02.420
We found plenty already.
We're here now,

362
00:24:02.421 --> 00:24:04.820
said alien and I won't blow our cover.

363
00:24:05.750 --> 00:24:10.580
Richard could spot a narrow opening an offense and 50 yards and recite security

364
00:24:10.581 --> 00:24:14.930
cameras aspects from memory,
forthright,
credible and confident.

365
00:24:15.140 --> 00:24:20.120
He was like all of her bosses.
Terrific.
At presentations.
It was clear,

366
00:24:20.121 --> 00:24:24.410
however that he had neither the patients nor the aptitude for with those in the

367
00:24:24.411 --> 00:24:27.410
infosec community called social engineering.

368
00:24:28.430 --> 00:24:31.280
Bluntly put the term at manipulating people.

369
00:24:31.820 --> 00:24:35.120
You might call it charming them or in some cases scaring them,

370
00:24:35.300 --> 00:24:39.920
but it was always about getting them to do what you wanted.
Whoever you were.

371
00:24:39.950 --> 00:24:43.330
The trick was to assess the other person and figure out how to,

372
00:24:43.340 --> 00:24:47.670
you might talk him or her into something,
perhaps the best name for it.

373
00:24:47.770 --> 00:24:51.650
It might be human hacking.
Freshman year,
for example,

374
00:24:51.890 --> 00:24:56.300
getting Alex and Vlad to help alien with her calculus homework had been social

375
00:24:56.301 --> 00:24:57.134
engineering.

376
00:24:57.470 --> 00:25:01.130
More recently she had turned her dinner out with the bosses into a kind of job

377
00:25:01.131 --> 00:25:01.964
interview.

378
00:25:02.540 --> 00:25:07.160
Consciously or not every child or parent teacher or military leader,

379
00:25:07.190 --> 00:25:09.740
politician or player on the dating scene,

380
00:25:09.860 --> 00:25:14.860
you social engineering for pen testers or their criminal counterparts like those

381
00:25:15.021 --> 00:25:18.920
who send phishing emails or persuaded victims to empty their bank accounts.

382
00:25:19.100 --> 00:25:20.780
The appeal was obvious.

383
00:25:21.440 --> 00:25:25.820
Why bother breaking into anything when you can get individuals to open their

384
00:25:25.821 --> 00:25:29.930
doors for you and because people,
especially men,

385
00:25:30.050 --> 00:25:34.520
were generally less suspicious of women in this kind of situation being female,

386
00:25:34.521 --> 00:25:37.970
it could be an advantage.
It will be fine.

387
00:25:38.330 --> 00:25:41.660
Alien smiled sweetly.
I'll be quick and come right back.

388
00:25:41.661 --> 00:25:45.770
If there's any problem before Richard could say another word.

389
00:25:45.950 --> 00:25:49.920
She was out the door with her laptop case alien cross,

390
00:25:49.921 --> 00:25:54.921
the gray slate floor of the spacious lobby for hip high stainless steel gateways

391
00:25:55.141 --> 00:25:56.930
stood between her and the elevators.

392
00:25:57.410 --> 00:26:01.340
Each was equipped with a wedge shaped black barrier that receded when you placed

393
00:26:01.341 --> 00:26:05.960
your badge on a scanner.
Then as soon as anyone past the gateway,

394
00:26:06.110 --> 00:26:11.110
the barrier closed immediately preventing tailgating next to the gates was a

395
00:26:11.571 --> 00:26:12.950
wide marble counter.

396
00:26:13.010 --> 00:26:17.750
Also gray behind which stood a white haired guard in a crisp black uniform

397
00:26:17.870 --> 00:26:19.220
including a matching tie.

398
00:26:20.240 --> 00:26:24.410
She walked toward the badge reader system as though expecting to go through when

399
00:26:24.411 --> 00:26:25.310
the barriers stopped.

400
00:26:25.311 --> 00:26:28.460
Her alien acted startled purposely trying to catch the guards.

401
00:26:28.461 --> 00:26:32.900
I then she approached him,
hi.
She said,
I'm with it.

402
00:26:32.990 --> 00:26:36.530
We have a computer emergency on the seventh floor.
I need to get up there.

403
00:26:37.280 --> 00:26:41.000
She would be happy to get an anywhere but new from remote reconnaissance that

404
00:26:41.001 --> 00:26:45.090
this was the floor with the most day to day office up close.

405
00:26:45.110 --> 00:26:49.550
The man looked even older than she had originally estimated at least 65 iLien

406
00:26:49.560 --> 00:26:53.670
guest with thin gold frame,
bifocals and permanent greases in his forehead.

407
00:26:54.270 --> 00:26:57.030
Still.
He looked in excellent shape or racked and alert.

408
00:26:57.990 --> 00:27:00.960
You have to use your badge.
The guard said or I in the list.

409
00:27:01.200 --> 00:27:05.790
He asked pointing to a black part cover binder on the table.
No,

410
00:27:06.060 --> 00:27:10.140
I mean it.
Alien told him reassuming an old role.
I'm new.

411
00:27:10.200 --> 00:27:14.730
I just started yesterday.
The guard frowned.
Where's your badge?

412
00:27:14.731 --> 00:27:18.330
He asked.
I don't have a badge yet.
Set alien smoothly,

413
00:27:18.450 --> 00:27:23.010
but my name is Elizabeth Testament and my boss is ted.
Robert,
t.

414
00:27:23.011 --> 00:27:26.970
E.
D.
R.
O.
B.
E.
R.
T.
S.

415
00:27:27.270 --> 00:27:31.590
Here's his card.
She lifted her laptop case in place.

416
00:27:31.591 --> 00:27:33.480
It squarely on the counter between them.

417
00:27:33.750 --> 00:27:37.110
She tugged the Zipper and took out and slid him one of her new cards as well as

418
00:27:37.111 --> 00:27:41.850
Ted's.
The guard entered both names in his computer system.
He's in here.

419
00:27:41.851 --> 00:27:44.640
He acknowledged you need to call them to get added to the list.

420
00:27:45.510 --> 00:27:49.830
I mean opened her phone pretending to call Ted and leave a message as she did so

421
00:27:49.860 --> 00:27:51.840
holding the phone against your ear with her shoulders.

422
00:27:51.840 --> 00:27:56.580
She undid the buttons of retrenched code.
Hi,
Mr. Roberts.
She said,

423
00:27:56.610 --> 00:28:01.080
this is Elizabeth.
I'm leaving you a voicemail.
I'm really sorry to bother you.

424
00:28:01.081 --> 00:28:04.380
They won't let me up to the seventh floor.
I know it's an emergency.

425
00:28:04.410 --> 00:28:07.950
Can you call me back please?
I'm really sorry.
Thanks.

426
00:28:08.970 --> 00:28:12.780
She stood awkwardly in front of the desk checking her phone and looking
fleeting.

427
00:28:12.781 --> 00:28:17.220
Lead the elevators.
The guard cringed.
I can try him again.

428
00:28:17.221 --> 00:28:19.710
She said to him,
I'm really sorry to keep you waiting.

429
00:28:19.800 --> 00:28:22.320
I know there was a big server crash right before I left.

430
00:28:22.440 --> 00:28:25.800
He might be in the data center.
I just can't leave without fixing this.

431
00:28:25.801 --> 00:28:29.340
I promised the guard was clearly conflicted.

432
00:28:29.940 --> 00:28:33.120
He looked down giving her a card.
Only a second glance.

433
00:28:33.540 --> 00:28:38.040
Then though he waved her forward.
Look,
I know it's important.
He said,

434
00:28:38.070 --> 00:28:41.490
I'll make an exception.
Just be quick.
Thanks.
I will.

435
00:28:41.491 --> 00:28:44.970
She told him just as she had Richard and leave,

436
00:28:44.971 --> 00:28:48.510
grabbed her laptop bag and step forward to the closest gateway.

437
00:28:49.200 --> 00:28:53.670
The guard pushed a button under the counter.
The barriers parted with a wash.

438
00:28:54.700 --> 00:28:58.800
Alien was surprised to feel her heart pounding as she stepped out of the

439
00:28:58.801 --> 00:29:02.850
elevator.
She'd taken much greater physical risks in college,

440
00:29:03.150 --> 00:29:04.890
but she never tried to steal something.

441
00:29:05.910 --> 00:29:10.440
For now at least there was nobody else on this floor.
Alien moved quickly.

442
00:29:10.740 --> 00:29:15.720
Most workspaces she saw Rick cubicles containing white desks separated by six

443
00:29:15.721 --> 00:29:20.190
foot freestanding gray walls at the perimeter of the four were the larger

444
00:29:20.191 --> 00:29:24.330
individual offices of middle level managers with glass walls and doors.

445
00:29:25.140 --> 00:29:30.140
Occupants of the cubicles personalize their space with photos and trinkets on

446
00:29:30.301 --> 00:29:34.650
every desk was a black phone and a Dell laptop connected to an external keyboard

447
00:29:34.651 --> 00:29:38.070
and monitor alien have did a few laptops.

448
00:29:38.400 --> 00:29:40.170
All were secured with cables.

449
00:29:40.800 --> 00:29:45.010
She to try the manager's spaces starting with a corner office with an unimpeded

450
00:29:45.011 --> 00:29:48.610
view of the downtown.
It had the same computer set up.

451
00:29:48.670 --> 00:29:52.180
The one a larger grade desk.
She lifted the laptop,

452
00:29:53.470 --> 00:29:58.470
no cable alien heard the elevator ding announcing the return of the first of the

453
00:29:58.661 --> 00:30:02.110
employees from lunch to men chatted as they went to their desks,

454
00:30:02.200 --> 00:30:03.250
not noticing her.

455
00:30:03.910 --> 00:30:08.170
She slipped out of the corner office with a laptop and walked past two more

456
00:30:08.171 --> 00:30:10.480
employees and Liam was positive.

457
00:30:10.481 --> 00:30:14.770
She looked as guilty as she felt that these employees ignored her to her heart

458
00:30:14.771 --> 00:30:17.020
was beating harder than ever to a bank.

459
00:30:17.050 --> 00:30:20.050
Nothing meant more than its reputation for trustworthiness.

460
00:30:21.070 --> 00:30:25.210
The machine might have confidential customer files on it.
Castle business plans,

461
00:30:25.300 --> 00:30:29.650
corporate personnel records are all of the above and identity theft ring

462
00:30:29.651 --> 00:30:33.460
exploiting that information could make millions so could shady stock market

463
00:30:33.461 --> 00:30:38.050
traders or any of castle's national and international competitors and the fines

464
00:30:38.051 --> 00:30:42.340
and settlement fees once a big breach was disclosed,
could run to eight figures.

465
00:30:42.770 --> 00:30:43.630
Choice point,

466
00:30:43.690 --> 00:30:48.340
the commercial data broker had paid $15 million the previous year for giving up

467
00:30:48.341 --> 00:30:50.980
information on 163,000 people.

468
00:30:53.380 --> 00:30:57.280
Alien walked to the elevator as confidently as she could smiling professionally

469
00:30:57.281 --> 00:31:01.270
at others as their paths crossed.
Everyone else wore a rigid badge,

470
00:31:01.271 --> 00:31:04.960
but their name headshot in the castle logo clipped to their shirt or waistband.

471
00:31:05.380 --> 00:31:07.870
So she shielded those areas with the laptop case.

472
00:31:08.980 --> 00:31:13.000
The elevator opened back in the lobby.
Did you get it taken care of?

473
00:31:13.001 --> 00:31:16.510
The security guard asked?
Yes.
Thanks so much.

474
00:31:16.511 --> 00:31:20.540
Said alien giving them a thumbs up.
She crossed the street,

475
00:31:20.750 --> 00:31:24.470
open the car door and slipped back inside the tourists.

476
00:31:25.550 --> 00:31:29.600
Not uh,
Richard said in a,
told you so tone.

477
00:31:31.170 --> 00:31:34.670
I did it,
you know,
he and said she's at to open the case.

478
00:31:35.240 --> 00:31:38.150
I got a laptop.
What?

479
00:31:38.810 --> 00:31:43.700
Richard's eyebrows rose as he be held her prize.
Holy Shit.

480
00:31:43.730 --> 00:31:44.563
He said.

481
00:31:45.770 --> 00:31:50.770
So they call that a m and m security.

482
00:31:50.990 --> 00:31:52.220
It's hard on the outside,

483
00:31:52.250 --> 00:31:55.010
soft in the middle and once you get past the outer defenses,

484
00:31:55.280 --> 00:31:58.690
there's a lot of a good step to take.
I talked to uh,

485
00:31:59.000 --> 00:32:02.030
a penetration tester who was one of her colleagues for awhile.

486
00:32:02.650 --> 00:32:04.310
Do you want to guess what his specialty was?

487
00:32:07.000 --> 00:32:09.520
Social engineering is the way in,
but then what does he,

488
00:32:09.550 --> 00:32:12.430
what does he specialize it?
Shred bins.

489
00:32:13.540 --> 00:32:15.280
He's like shred bins or the greatest,

490
00:32:15.610 --> 00:32:18.640
they take all of their most confidential information.

491
00:32:19.390 --> 00:32:22.600
They put it in one place and then they put it on wheels.

492
00:32:24.310 --> 00:32:27.490
I was like,
nobody ever caught you?
He said,
well,
you know,
once I was willing,
one,

493
00:32:27.491 --> 00:32:31.090
I'm in,
the guard stopped me and I froze.
And he said,
Hey,
what are you doing?

494
00:32:31.360 --> 00:32:35.020
And I just raised my hands and he said,
that goes down in the freight elevator.

495
00:32:35.360 --> 00:32:39.920
Uh,
so,
um,
definitely made me a little differently,

496
00:32:39.921 --> 00:32:42.770
a tread days and my bank,
ah,
things like that.

497
00:32:42.800 --> 00:32:45.200
So you start looking at things differently.
Hanging out with these hackers.

498
00:32:46.130 --> 00:32:46.530
Anyway,

499
00:32:46.530 --> 00:32:49.470
<v 0>Rob Laptop from corporate headquarters on day one,</v>

500
00:32:49.500 --> 00:32:52.200
you get promoted pretty quickly.
If that's true.
New Job,

501
00:32:52.201 --> 00:32:56.610
she's soon talking your way into bank vaults themselves and doing computer stuff

502
00:32:56.611 --> 00:33:00.270
from like Internet cafes,
getting into an airline reservation system,

503
00:33:00.520 --> 00:33:04.270
<v 2>doing recovery for breached government.
You know,</v>

504
00:33:04.300 --> 00:33:09.300
taking a sort of antenna on the highway outside of a major defense manufacturer

505
00:33:09.700 --> 00:33:14.650
and you know,
sort of whisper is sucking their data on to her computer,
uh,

506
00:33:14.770 --> 00:33:15.940
and so on and so forth.

507
00:33:16.540 --> 00:33:21.540
Eventually she starts her own company and sort of not on purpose so much,

508
00:33:22.031 --> 00:33:24.820
but as this industry grows up and becomes a bigger and bigger field,

509
00:33:24.821 --> 00:33:29.620
takes on new employees and becomes a manager and then a CEO and she has this

510
00:33:29.621 --> 00:33:32.980
sort of new generation of hackers,
uh,

511
00:33:33.040 --> 00:33:36.130
that she sort of trained and brought up under her wing.

512
00:33:36.760 --> 00:33:40.630
And that leads to different pressures and different sort of perspective like

513
00:33:40.631 --> 00:33:44.680
when you give birth and you have to debug a phishing site the same day from the

514
00:33:44.681 --> 00:33:45.514
hospital.

515
00:33:45.740 --> 00:33:47.540
<v 0>Uh,
so that was again,</v>

516
00:33:47.600 --> 00:33:52.470
<v 2>sort of parts of hackers storytelling I hadn't seen before.
I thought I'd just,</v>

517
00:33:52.500 --> 00:33:56.350
and the reading part with a couple of real short passages,
uh,

518
00:33:56.370 --> 00:33:59.880
from closer to the end,
uh,
from her kind of CEO days,

519
00:34:05.580 --> 00:34:08.520
Alien Path,
sorry,
Luke,
Gus,

520
00:34:08.610 --> 00:34:13.610
Cheryl and two new pen testers gathered around the break table discussing their

521
00:34:13.741 --> 00:34:16.710
latest work with client zero six,
six,

522
00:34:16.711 --> 00:34:19.350
six avast vast retail chain,

523
00:34:19.410 --> 00:34:22.170
the needed remote and onsite penetration tests,

524
00:34:22.470 --> 00:34:24.420
mobile and web APP assessments,

525
00:34:24.570 --> 00:34:28.200
and a security review of its credit card processing systems,

526
00:34:29.310 --> 00:34:33.600
who's onsite now asked Alien Milo.
Gus answered.

527
00:34:34.020 --> 00:34:37.830
He cracked their wireless network from a cafe inside one of their stores and

528
00:34:37.831 --> 00:34:40.290
then wormed his way into the company's central systems.

529
00:34:41.160 --> 00:34:43.980
He got root on the badge printing system,
said Cheryl,

530
00:34:44.340 --> 00:34:47.700
he could add his name and photograph to the badge system and give them some

531
00:34:47.730 --> 00:34:50.580
access to any building,
any room,
you name it.

532
00:34:51.720 --> 00:34:53.700
One of the new pen testers piped up.

533
00:34:54.390 --> 00:34:58.560
We found this internal database that had the entire shopping history of every

534
00:34:58.590 --> 00:35:03.390
single customer.
Every customer asked alien.

535
00:35:04.260 --> 00:35:07.710
She shopped at six six,
six.
Everybody did.

536
00:35:08.820 --> 00:35:13.200
Gus Hemmed,
Cheryl tittered.
What said alien?

537
00:35:14.070 --> 00:35:15.360
We found you.

538
00:35:15.390 --> 00:35:20.390
Sheryl said the earliest entry was from 1993 ancient history to the 24 year old.

539
00:35:24.780 --> 00:35:29.010
Congratulations.
Alien opened the fridge and grabbed a water bottle.

540
00:35:29.640 --> 00:35:33.780
She pictured the entire break room papered with her life story as told through

541
00:35:33.781 --> 00:35:38.610
six six six receipts for my first bra to her daughter's crib.

542
00:35:40.830 --> 00:35:44.040
Last one
in mid September.

543
00:35:44.120 --> 00:35:46.770
Tree Line Bank called T.
S.

544
00:35:46.770 --> 00:35:51.030
C the pseudonym I use for her hacking company on behalf of one of its customers,

545
00:35:51.420 --> 00:35:55.680
a construction company based in Salt Lake City.
A day earlier,

546
00:35:55.710 --> 00:36:00.250
the company's payroll manager had clicked on a phishing email link that infected

547
00:36:00.270 --> 00:36:03.840
his web browser with a man in the middle attack allowing hackers to see

548
00:36:03.841 --> 00:36:08.841
everything he typed and even replaces familiar treeline online banking page with

549
00:36:08.971 --> 00:36:11.940
an exact replica asking for additional credentials.

550
00:36:12.630 --> 00:36:17.100
Only a second layer of security requiring special executive approval for large

551
00:36:17.101 --> 00:36:22.101
wire transfers had stopped the firm from losing almost $60,000 to an offshore

552
00:36:22.140 --> 00:36:22.973
account.

553
00:36:23.490 --> 00:36:27.150
Could TSC investigate and find out what happened and how to fix it?

554
00:36:28.380 --> 00:36:30.300
Susanna,
that's her COO,

555
00:36:30.540 --> 00:36:34.770
sent Luke onsite to image any effected computers and interview staff.

556
00:36:35.490 --> 00:36:36.940
When he returned my low,

557
00:36:36.941 --> 00:36:40.500
took over using the equipment in the forensics lab to inspect everything

558
00:36:40.501 --> 00:36:41.334
carefully.

559
00:36:41.880 --> 00:36:46.880
That payroll manager had clicked on 19 links and as many different phishing

560
00:36:47.341 --> 00:36:51.900
emails he discovered alien volunteered to help finish the job.

561
00:36:52.710 --> 00:36:54.390
I'll do the malware analysis.

562
00:36:54.420 --> 00:36:58.050
She said to understand how the malware worked.

563
00:36:58.110 --> 00:37:02.310
Alien set it up in a sandbox recorded cordoned off virtual machine environment.

564
00:37:03.090 --> 00:37:07.080
This gave her the digital equivalent of a high level biosafety lab where the

565
00:37:07.081 --> 00:37:10.050
software could be safely stored,
inspected,
and dissected.

566
00:37:10.860 --> 00:37:14.610
Alien started by viewing the page source for the email link that led to the man

567
00:37:14.611 --> 00:37:19.200
in the middle attack.
It was neatly written by sophisticated programmers.

568
00:37:20.070 --> 00:37:23.400
These bad guys or good of late,

569
00:37:23.460 --> 00:37:28.460
the best black hats had emulated successful Silicon Valley entrepreneurs

570
00:37:29.220 --> 00:37:34.080
licensing the use of their work through cloud based commercial software suites

571
00:37:34.230 --> 00:37:37.920
called exploit kits to begin a mass attack.

572
00:37:37.980 --> 00:37:41.880
You didn't have to know how to write a computer program or even have your own

573
00:37:41.881 --> 00:37:44.850
computer.
You just logged in from anywhere,

574
00:37:44.940 --> 00:37:49.350
shows the kind of hacks that you wanted and paid by the day,
month or year.

575
00:37:49.950 --> 00:37:51.840
Some black had services accepted.

576
00:37:51.840 --> 00:37:55.350
Payment by does stuck by deducting a percentage of the take.

577
00:37:56.520 --> 00:38:00.960
Alien infected the virtual machine and then came back 48 hours later to check

578
00:38:00.961 --> 00:38:01.980
with a digital feeds.

579
00:38:01.981 --> 00:38:06.981
Had been doing the software began by configuring itself to run and startup.

580
00:38:07.710 --> 00:38:11.850
Then it phoned home once every 20 minutes seeking updates or further

581
00:38:11.851 --> 00:38:15.540
instructions for one of a series of modern and command and control servers

582
00:38:15.570 --> 00:38:20.370
around the world.
What do you want me to do?
The program asked in essence,

583
00:38:20.940 --> 00:38:24.570
and the criminals at the other end of the connection could order whatever they

584
00:38:24.571 --> 00:38:26.880
wanted.
It's impressive.

585
00:38:26.881 --> 00:38:30.300
She told Susanna afterward and more than a little frightening,

586
00:38:30.810 --> 00:38:33.030
not just in itself,
but for what it portended.

587
00:38:33.600 --> 00:38:36.340
This wasn't a solo hidden run operator.

588
00:38:36.670 --> 00:38:41.670
It was the work of a group of professional hackers just like t s c cause she had

589
00:38:42.611 --> 00:38:46.090
gone from novice to student,
student to practitioner,

590
00:38:46.150 --> 00:38:47.680
practitioner to teacher,

591
00:38:47.710 --> 00:38:51.160
and managed to manager all as a white hat hacker.

592
00:38:51.610 --> 00:38:55.060
Black hat hackers across the globe had followed a parallel path,

593
00:38:55.390 --> 00:38:57.010
organizing their operations,

594
00:38:57.250 --> 00:39:02.250
establishing reputations and finding clients and bringing in money to their

595
00:39:02.651 --> 00:39:03.484
communities.

596
00:39:04.120 --> 00:39:08.260
Alien had never realized it and she had never wished for it for one could even

597
00:39:08.261 --> 00:39:12.130
say she had needed the black hats to keep growing and getting new opportunities

598
00:39:12.131 --> 00:39:16.150
for cell.
How many employees do you think they have?

599
00:39:16.360 --> 00:39:20.110
Alien asked,
I don't know.
Susanna said,

600
00:39:20.560 --> 00:39:23.500
but their sales team is definitely bigger than ours.

601
00:39:25.180 --> 00:39:27.580
Alien laughed from Susanna's desk.

602
00:39:27.760 --> 00:39:29.830
She picked up a little statue she had given her.

603
00:39:31.240 --> 00:39:35.020
I wonder maybe on the other side of the world,

604
00:39:35.560 --> 00:39:40.270
if there's an evil Susanna,
Susanna raised an eyebrow Riley,

605
00:39:40.960 --> 00:39:44.760
well then they would have to be an evil alien too.

606
00:39:45.850 --> 00:39:46.683
Thank you guys.

607
00:39:47.630 --> 00:39:52.630
<v 1>[inaudible]</v>

608
00:39:53.800 --> 00:39:57.490
<v 2>so that's a kind of a taste of some of the scope and the stories and the kind of</v>

609
00:39:57.880 --> 00:40:02.880
evolution in the field and in her life trying to use the storytelling style to

610
00:40:03.911 --> 00:40:07.690
kind of express that.
Um,
I'd love to,
uh,

611
00:40:07.691 --> 00:40:12.040
answer any questions you have about either the writing process or other stories

612
00:40:12.041 --> 00:40:15.970
from the book or other topics that are of interest to you or,
uh,

613
00:40:16.030 --> 00:40:20.020
teach me something that's keeping you up at night today.
Uh,

614
00:40:20.110 --> 00:40:24.830
security folks or any other folks.
Uh,
and I'll pass it on to the next time.

615
00:40:26.410 --> 00:40:27.340
Um,

616
00:40:28.060 --> 00:40:33.060
comment on what's unique or different or interesting in particular

617
00:40:36.280 --> 00:40:40.300
about her experiences as,
as a woman in this field.

618
00:40:40.690 --> 00:40:41.950
So yeah,

619
00:40:41.980 --> 00:40:46.980
I mean she gets that job breaking into banks by taking a security class and the

620
00:40:49.241 --> 00:40:53.340
instructor there is one of the leaders of,
you know,

621
00:40:53.341 --> 00:40:58.330
a major pen testing operation.
And when she goes into that class,

622
00:40:58.570 --> 00:41:01.390
it is herself and there are 19 guys.

623
00:41:02.170 --> 00:41:05.770
And so that's a very different experience.

624
00:41:05.920 --> 00:41:10.420
And people when they start the contest at the end of that class,

625
00:41:10.810 --> 00:41:13.870
which is sort of a hacking contest,
uh,

626
00:41:14.710 --> 00:41:19.710
the guy's kind of shoved her aside and she and that situation at the beginning

627
00:41:21.520 --> 00:41:24.430
shoves herself aside or at least lets them take the lead.

628
00:41:24.431 --> 00:41:29.140
She's used to being outnumbered and she's used to being at MIT where as she put

629
00:41:29.141 --> 00:41:29.411
it,
you know,

630
00:41:29.411 --> 00:41:32.890
guys were taking apart hello building helicopters with their dad when they were

631
00:41:32.900 --> 00:41:34.130
four and everyone was like 15

632
00:41:34.130 --> 00:41:35.510
<v 0>years ahead of me when I was a freshman.</v>

633
00:41:36.200 --> 00:41:39.350
So she doesn't think of herself as more technically adept.

634
00:41:40.100 --> 00:41:44.330
But what she finds is her chops had been built up over the time she had a boss

635
00:41:44.331 --> 00:41:49.100
between those two things at Los Alamos National Laboratory who would not let her

636
00:41:49.101 --> 00:41:52.640
work to start working for him until she can do everything without her hands ever

637
00:41:52.641 --> 00:41:57.560
leaving the keyboard.
And so she knew how to code.
She knew,
you know,
command line,

638
00:41:57.800 --> 00:42:01.790
but she didn't know how to,
you know,
play a keyboard like a guitar,
you know,

639
00:42:01.791 --> 00:42:05.290
it wasn't,
and that level of extension where you,

640
00:42:05.330 --> 00:42:07.340
the computers basically an extension of your body.

641
00:42:08.090 --> 00:42:11.930
She was watching her classmates who kind of nudge her aside at that contest,

642
00:42:12.110 --> 00:42:15.560
sort of stumble.
They kind of wanted a graphical user interface.

643
00:42:15.561 --> 00:42:17.120
They just weren't quite as adept.

644
00:42:17.180 --> 00:42:19.160
They didn't have the experience she had had at the hospital.

645
00:42:19.910 --> 00:42:24.410
And so eventually she sorted starts doing it on her own and little by little the

646
00:42:24.411 --> 00:42:26.930
guys started lining up behind her.
Um,

647
00:42:27.260 --> 00:42:31.070
and her fingers are flying and she's owning system after system.

648
00:42:31.100 --> 00:42:33.110
And for her that was a transformational moment.

649
00:42:33.470 --> 00:42:35.450
Not because that was when she got the skills,

650
00:42:35.451 --> 00:42:39.110
but that's when she realized that she had had the skills.
Um,

651
00:42:39.170 --> 00:42:43.760
cause you have that sort of image of yourself as a freshmen or a kid.

652
00:42:44.180 --> 00:42:46.100
Often that's based in an insecure moment.

653
00:42:46.340 --> 00:42:51.320
And then here's the moment of realizing I can do this.
And you know,

654
00:42:51.321 --> 00:42:56.321
that sort of sexism or exclusion or at least being a minority continues in a lot

655
00:42:56.661 --> 00:43:00.110
of different parts of her career.
Um,

656
00:43:00.620 --> 00:43:04.250
but you know,
she asked to in conversations,

657
00:43:04.490 --> 00:43:07.430
she says the default when she finally does get a job interview after that,

658
00:43:07.431 --> 00:43:11.060
the default is if a guy's talking to the other guys assume that he knows what

659
00:43:11.061 --> 00:43:15.170
he's talking about until he proves otherwise they assume the opposite in her

660
00:43:15.171 --> 00:43:16.460
situation.
So she's like,

661
00:43:16.580 --> 00:43:20.270
I have to sort of drop more technical references early on to sort of establish

662
00:43:20.271 --> 00:43:25.250
my chops.
Um,
you know,
at least for a time she had a,
well,

663
00:43:25.410 --> 00:43:26.530
yeah.
Anyway,
like you know,

664
00:43:27.020 --> 00:43:31.410
it's important to talk about emacs earlier in the conversation.
Uh,

665
00:43:31.460 --> 00:43:35.720
when you're a female hacker,
I'm told.
So,
um,
you know,

666
00:43:35.750 --> 00:43:39.920
at the same time,
as I said,
there are fields even within hacking,

667
00:43:39.950 --> 00:43:44.390
particularly where you're playing with people's expectations where that can be

668
00:43:44.391 --> 00:43:44.961
an advantage.

669
00:43:44.961 --> 00:43:49.961
Sometimes you want to be the innocent figure that they don't suspect is going to

670
00:43:50.001 --> 00:43:50.900
be an adversary.

671
00:43:51.140 --> 00:43:55.790
Other times she got like a $2 clipboard and she was the authority figure.

672
00:43:55.791 --> 00:43:59.000
You put on a suit and $2 clipboard and certainly you start questioning people

673
00:43:59.300 --> 00:44:02.270
and they kind of like,
let me see your,
you know,
you go to the guard,
you're like,

674
00:44:02.480 --> 00:44:05.180
I'm doing a spot check.
Can I see your badge?
Can you show me?

675
00:44:05.181 --> 00:44:05.901
I want to check this,

676
00:44:05.901 --> 00:44:10.520
the locks on this whole building ad sooner in the bank vault so you can flip

677
00:44:10.521 --> 00:44:13.100
roles too.
Um,
so,

678
00:44:13.580 --> 00:44:17.920
and then there's experiences that obviously there's no escaping their gendered,

679
00:44:17.930 --> 00:44:20.540
like giving birth,
being pregnant.
Uh,

680
00:44:20.570 --> 00:44:23.540
these are experiences only a woman can have it at this point in our

681
00:44:23.541 --> 00:44:27.970
technological life at least.
Um,
and you know,

682
00:44:27.980 --> 00:44:32.980
doing that while being a CEO while being a hacker is to me another extension of

683
00:44:34.260 --> 00:44:39.090
her Badassery,
uh,
and women's bad ass hurry if you will.

684
00:44:39.270 --> 00:44:43.000
So,
um,
it was cool to see that,
uh,

685
00:44:43.080 --> 00:44:46.380
evolution and also sort of mentoring women and men.

686
00:44:47.890 --> 00:44:52.200
You know,
there are some,
some differences,
but that's in the book.
Yeah.

687
00:44:52.890 --> 00:44:57.230
Are you able to say what year is she?
Yeah.
Uh,

688
00:44:57.280 --> 00:45:00.510
1998 to 2003 yeah.

689
00:45:01.630 --> 00:45:05.890
Did I assume any personal habits that I changed in the course of writing this

690
00:45:05.891 --> 00:45:08.560
book?
So kind of two categories.
One,

691
00:45:08.710 --> 00:45:11.350
I started doing crazy stuff because I was hanging out with hackers and trying to

692
00:45:11.351 --> 00:45:12.940
report and understand their experience.

693
00:45:13.180 --> 00:45:17.230
So I dunno how many of you have gone to like def con or any of the black hat,

694
00:45:17.231 --> 00:45:19.840
those kinds of conventions?
Yeah.
So as you know,

695
00:45:19.841 --> 00:45:24.841
there's like 25,000 actors in Vegas for the weekend and you just kind of see

696
00:45:25.990 --> 00:45:28.090
where the spirit takes you in those things.

697
00:45:28.091 --> 00:45:33.091
And I ended up in a shooting range that they had set up a like 30 minutes out

698
00:45:33.610 --> 00:45:36.940
and the unincorporated land in the Vegas desert and there's like drone driven

699
00:45:36.941 --> 00:45:41.350
skeet people are firing cannons.
They made themselves,
ah,
I was like,
well,

700
00:45:41.370 --> 00:45:43.990
you know,
I've come a long way from home.

701
00:45:44.800 --> 00:45:48.910
I also climbed up on the domes and MIT and alleges and did that kind of stuff.

702
00:45:49.030 --> 00:45:52.900
And I got a tour through Los Alamos National Laboratory,
which is crazy,
right?

703
00:45:52.900 --> 00:45:54.550
It's like you're walking through the Grand Canyon.

704
00:45:54.730 --> 00:45:59.410
You take a right and there's MIT guarded by people with machine guns.

705
00:45:59.470 --> 00:46:04.120
So,
um,
you know,
those were exciting.
And as for my own personal habits,

706
00:46:04.121 --> 00:46:08.170
sure I started using email encryption,
I started using full disk encryption.

707
00:46:08.590 --> 00:46:09.423
Um,

708
00:46:09.430 --> 00:46:13.770
I was honestly more careful what I googled cause I was like somebody knowing

709
00:46:13.880 --> 00:46:18.850
what I'm piping in one way or another.
Uh,
and I have certain,
you know,

710
00:46:18.851 --> 00:46:22.840
agreements of confidentiality to change identifying details,
but you know,

711
00:46:23.350 --> 00:46:24.670
you guys are going to know or you know,

712
00:46:24.671 --> 00:46:27.910
your machines are going to know whatever I type in.
Uh,

713
00:46:27.940 --> 00:46:32.650
and I left my phone,
uh,
you know,
when I took walks,

714
00:46:32.651 --> 00:46:35.890
if I didn't need it,
why be tracked?
Uh,

715
00:46:36.190 --> 00:46:39.970
you have a story like that where the retailer has the shopping history.

716
00:46:40.390 --> 00:46:45.040
We've all,
I'm just going to make a guest.
90% of us have shopped at six,
you know,

717
00:46:45.070 --> 00:46:48.730
should I,
six,
six,
six.
Uh,
and you know,

718
00:46:48.731 --> 00:46:52.030
you realize that's not an isolated thing.
We've,
we all shop period.

719
00:46:52.330 --> 00:46:56.230
And everywhere we go that stuff is stored.
It's stored.
Data is forever.

720
00:46:56.800 --> 00:46:57.790
So,
you know,

721
00:46:57.791 --> 00:47:01.690
that kind of made me think about situations where I wanted to pay cash,

722
00:47:01.691 --> 00:47:05.920
not necessarily out of paranoia,
but just out of intentionality,

723
00:47:05.950 --> 00:47:07.570
if you will.
Um,

724
00:47:07.571 --> 00:47:11.980
and sort of thinking about the price of convenience and certain obliviousness

725
00:47:12.070 --> 00:47:16.720
and certainly things like smart fridges and doorbells are pretty terrifying to

726
00:47:16.721 --> 00:47:20.360
me after hanging out,
you know,
Internet of things village,
uh,

727
00:47:20.361 --> 00:47:24.160
at def con for [inaudible].
Well,
thank you very much for coming.

728
00:47:25.950 --> 00:47:28.860
You are welcome.
So that's our time.
Is that what you're saying?
Yeah.

729
00:47:28.990 --> 00:47:32.740
So I wanted to say,
I don't know if I've lost my,
my slides.
We may have,

730
00:47:32.800 --> 00:47:37.750
I may have a gun without them too long.
Say that again.
Oh,
there you go.

731
00:47:37.750 --> 00:47:41.080
Okay.
Um,
I think,
let's see.

732
00:47:42.070 --> 00:47:45.210
I wanted to show you guys one more thing.
Um,

733
00:47:46.420 --> 00:47:49.180
just as a sort of example of the form,
uh,

734
00:47:49.181 --> 00:47:53.290
I don't know if any of you guys know a hacker named deviant,
uh,

735
00:47:53.320 --> 00:47:58.030
in the Seattle community.
He's a great organizer with tool,

736
00:47:58.060 --> 00:48:02.670
the open organization of lock pickers.
And he was a source,
uh,

737
00:48:02.800 --> 00:48:07.450
for an,
a guide for some of this material.
And he designed a hacker bookmark,

738
00:48:07.810 --> 00:48:11.230
uh,
for me and for the book.
Uh,
so it's,
uh,

739
00:48:11.260 --> 00:48:13.130
it's a little bit different material than normal.
Look,
mark,

740
00:48:13.131 --> 00:48:16.120
it's a kind of a flexible plastic on the back.

741
00:48:16.121 --> 00:48:19.720
You can see this bookmark opens doors and it's got instructions on how to use it

742
00:48:19.721 --> 00:48:20.590
for,
you know,

743
00:48:21.100 --> 00:48:24.430
certain kinds of lock picking your physical entry a lot like alien and her

744
00:48:24.431 --> 00:48:26.710
classmates did at Mit.
Uh,

745
00:48:26.740 --> 00:48:30.100
we've got a few of these signed by me and by alien for those,

746
00:48:30.130 --> 00:48:34.630
if anyone's interested,
if you get a more than one copy of the book,

747
00:48:34.720 --> 00:48:37.850
uh,
then that's a kind of bonus item.
So,
uh,

748
00:48:37.960 --> 00:48:41.100
think about that while supplies last.
Um,

749
00:48:41.120 --> 00:48:43.900
and I'll even if there go play with play with one too,

750
00:48:43.901 --> 00:48:46.240
it just to kind of get a sense of it.
Um,

751
00:48:46.270 --> 00:48:51.160
there's youtube videos of him using it to get all sorts of places.
Um,
so yeah,

752
00:48:51.161 --> 00:48:55.420
happy to talk more one on one.
Thank you so much for your time and um,

753
00:48:55.780 --> 00:48:57.160
keep us safe and safer.

754
00:48:58.320 --> 00:49:02.520
