1
00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:09.030
Thank you Andrea and I arena for joining us here today.
Uh,

2
00:00:09.160 --> 00:00:11.820
at Google we talk a lot about the user.
Uh,
yeah,

3
00:00:11.821 --> 00:00:14.850
I spent two and a half years in mountain view as a pm on a couple of different

4
00:00:14.851 --> 00:00:16.650
products.
And whenever I talked about the user,

5
00:00:16.651 --> 00:00:20.400
I would look at a dashboard and that dashboard would have various numbers and

6
00:00:20.401 --> 00:00:22.980
graphs of the number of users in different countries,

7
00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:26.460
the level of engagement that they had on a day to day or week to week basis.

8
00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:28.400
And that was my touchpoint.
Um,

9
00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:31.740
but I think why I'm so grateful that you're joining us here today is that you

10
00:00:31.741 --> 00:00:34.470
represent the user and it's so much more tangible sense.

11
00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:39.060
You are journalists on the front lines of it's super important issue for Google.

12
00:00:39.240 --> 00:00:41.460
You know,
our mission is to organize the world's information,

13
00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:44.670
make it accessible and useful,
and that is what you do everyday.

14
00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:46.800
You organize information and very sensitive,

15
00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:51.050
very challenging topics and you make it accessible and useful to the world.
Um,

16
00:00:51.060 --> 00:00:54.750
and so my hope today is that we can get into what that process looks like,

17
00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:57.200
how technology has helped and hindered.
Um,

18
00:00:57.320 --> 00:01:00.270
and what the folks in this room who cared about these issues can do to

19
00:01:00.271 --> 00:01:02.700
contribute going forward.
Um,
to begin with,

20
00:01:02.701 --> 00:01:06.080
maybe if you're comfortable just sharing a little bit about your backgrounds,
um,

21
00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:08.980
the work you do and the places that you do it in.

22
00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:13.950
<v 3>Well,
thank you Justin.
Thank you everybody for coming off for having us.
Uh,</v>

23
00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:18.910
US has sat and Justin said,
ah,
we are,
ah,
as the Russian investigative journalist,

24
00:01:18.911 --> 00:01:22.630
and we've been doing this for almost 17 years.
Uh,

25
00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:26.370
VFR focus on the Russian secret services,
uh,

26
00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:30.190
Enza led the fall zones.
Uh,
we,
uh,
start off investigations,

27
00:01:30.191 --> 00:01:34.280
a change and digital landscape and as a country,
and uh,

28
00:01:34.540 --> 00:01:39.270
in 2012,
it became quite apparent that,
uh,
is a Kremlin,

29
00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:44.280
God scaring all over the Internet and the most layer,

30
00:01:44.540 --> 00:01:49.510
uh,
because of the Arab spring and the Moscow protests in 2011,
2012.

31
00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:52.870
So it was a criminal and Stata,
they're massive,
uh,

32
00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:56.170
offensive on internet freedoms in our country.

33
00:01:57.410 --> 00:02:01.780
<v 0>Uh,
first name was Sanka food might enlighten me here.
And as Andrea mentioned,</v>

34
00:02:01.980 --> 00:02:05.150
as this time,
uh,
about,
uh,

35
00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:11.180
Internet censorship wasn't I in Russia became a s thought four item,

36
00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:13.350
our new book,
uh,
uh,

37
00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:16.490
Zara and web as a criminal swore on the Internet,

38
00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:21.960
which was published in [inaudible] in 2015 here in the United States.
Uh,

39
00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:26.430
but,
um,
since 2015,
uh,
have been,
uh,

40
00:02:26.570 --> 00:02:28.690
Manny developments in,
uh,

41
00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:33.760
Russia and u s relationship and notably during the US election and we filed,

42
00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:38.690
uh,
is that,
uh,

43
00:02:38.691 --> 00:02:43.691
is that it was very important to write about this and to share what we found of

44
00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:47.790
is,
uh,
by edit by Ed and a new chop,
the,
uh,

45
00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:52.900
to choose a book and the Cold Age Zero Red Web comes to the United States and it

46
00:02:53.841 --> 00:02:57.200
was published or this,
this all goes.

47
00:02:58.290 --> 00:03:01.480
<v 2>So let's talk about how censorship works in Russia.</v>

48
00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:05.800
Can you give me a little bit of a sense of on a day to day basis what the

49
00:03:05.801 --> 00:03:09.610
experience of someone in Russia is like as relates to censorship

50
00:03:10.210 --> 00:03:13.540
<v 3>while onto the sofas?
It looks like we have old elements,
uh,</v>

51
00:03:13.570 --> 00:03:18.050
technological elements of,
uh,
off censorship.
We have,
uh,

52
00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:21.250
Internet filtering system.
We have lots of black lists,

53
00:03:21.310 --> 00:03:24.780
not one of bonnet websites.
And we have a,

54
00:03:24.820 --> 00:03:28.340
an extensive system of a online.
So,

55
00:03:28.690 --> 00:03:32.070
and it's extremes intrusive,
uh,
extremely excellent.

56
00:03:32.071 --> 00:03:36.160
It's a system of back doors to all services,
uh,

57
00:03:36.190 --> 00:03:39.520
in our country for provided for the Russian secret services.

58
00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:42.520
And we also have,
unfortunately,

59
00:03:42.521 --> 00:03:46.240
they have people sent to jail for posting something,

60
00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:50.350
a sensitive or critical of the Kremlin.
But at the same time,

61
00:03:50.380 --> 00:03:54.700
it's quite clear that this system technological is not very,

62
00:03:55.150 --> 00:03:59.740
I would say effective,
uh,
internet filter in this porous.
Uh,
for example,

63
00:03:59.741 --> 00:04:00.790
if you want to,

64
00:04:01.180 --> 00:04:04.900
if you believe that you need to access a blocked website,

65
00:04:04.901 --> 00:04:09.510
you can use very simple methods,
a simple tools.
You don't need even to use VPN.

66
00:04:09.520 --> 00:04:11.890
You can use Google.
Translate is also hubs.

67
00:04:12.130 --> 00:04:16.300
<v 2>Anyone from Google translate here today,
I'll say hello.</v>

68
00:04:18.220 --> 00:04:22.440
<v 3>And,
um,
if you want to communicate securely,
you still have fears,</v>

69
00:04:22.450 --> 00:04:24.880
a Biz ops and you can use a messenger's.

70
00:04:24.900 --> 00:04:29.900
A lots of them are extremely popular in Russia and they that aren't in a sort of

71
00:04:30.011 --> 00:04:34.420
a new media.
Uh,
so,
but still,
uh,
the system,

72
00:04:34.870 --> 00:04:38.350
uh,
is quite effective in a salad,

73
00:04:38.480 --> 00:04:42.760
a silencing people who want to talk about,
uh,

74
00:04:42.790 --> 00:04:44.870
things online,
open there.
And,
um,

75
00:04:45.490 --> 00:04:49.170
I think the idea of the criminal approach is,
uh,

76
00:04:49.210 --> 00:04:52.420
to be based more on intimidation then technology.

77
00:04:52.780 --> 00:04:56.290
And actually it's a very Soviet approach.
Uh,
when we do social for our book,

78
00:04:56.291 --> 00:04:58.900
we checked how things were organized,
beckons the Soviet times.

79
00:04:59.380 --> 00:05:01.340
And one of the most astonishing thing,
uh,

80
00:05:01.360 --> 00:05:06.310
we found out is that the KGB is a powerful security to service.

81
00:05:06.370 --> 00:05:10.240
Uh,
was technically,
it was not very advanced.
Uh,

82
00:05:10.270 --> 00:05:14.970
it's a hate of powers of the KGB.
Uh,
it was capable of eavesdropping on,

83
00:05:15.030 --> 00:05:18.640
on,
on,
uh,
300 phone calls simultaneously

84
00:05:18.740 --> 00:05:22.320
<v 2>in read 100 phone calls at the same time.
That was,
that was the cap.
Yeah,</v>

85
00:05:22.400 --> 00:05:23.600
that was nice and nice and wide.

86
00:05:23.601 --> 00:05:26.750
It was frightened by as a kid to be in the side of things.
So absolutely.

87
00:05:26.770 --> 00:05:27.860
They know how,

88
00:05:28.230 --> 00:05:30.720
<v 3>how to send a message,
but everybody should be very,</v>

89
00:05:30.721 --> 00:05:35.110
very cautious and it looks like they use the same approach today is send a

90
00:05:35.120 --> 00:05:38.500
message.
They can pick up some people,
send them to jail and that would,

91
00:05:39.910 --> 00:05:42.330
<v 2>and does that work when they send folks to jail,
you know,</v>

92
00:05:42.331 --> 00:05:46.290
whether it's an activist,
a journalist,
someone else.
Um,
how,
what happens,

93
00:05:47.630 --> 00:05:51.900
<v 0>well happens blogger as that's not about journalists.</v>

94
00:05:51.990 --> 00:05:55.310
Journalists haven't been Santam's Ireland,
Russia,
um,

95
00:05:55.460 --> 00:05:59.790
that people found at Zion Jael.
Uh,
was that,
uh,
some,

96
00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:05.000
some kind of protest in the cities for Muslim Moscow and that's all or those

97
00:06:06.061 --> 00:06:10.390
protests effective no Sunday at one time.
So it was a fact of plan a blogger,

98
00:06:11.510 --> 00:06:16.450
a blogger who went to the church and play and play it,
uh,

99
00:06:16.520 --> 00:06:19.890
Pokemon goal and then posted a video on youtube,

100
00:06:19.891 --> 00:06:24.360
was sent to jail for it pauses for postings as leader because it is where it is

101
00:06:24.361 --> 00:06:28.320
very fancy for the Orthodox church in Russia.
And there are the special,

102
00:06:28.321 --> 00:06:32.100
a special,
a special article lodge as a criminal court.

103
00:06:32.460 --> 00:06:34.830
He was done two child,
uh,
at,
uh,

104
00:06:34.980 --> 00:06:38.310
incited a lot of protests are on the Internet,
on Youtube,

105
00:06:38.520 --> 00:06:43.380
everywhere and even on the street.
And,
uh,
after this protest,
he was,

106
00:06:43.440 --> 00:06:48.290
uh,
release the US wailed and he wasn't relieved,
but he's under,
under,

107
00:06:48.350 --> 00:06:51.180
under her,
under house arrest.
And that's,
that's okay.

108
00:06:51.870 --> 00:06:54.900
<v 2>So what are,
what are people's views on censorship in Russia?</v>

109
00:06:54.930 --> 00:06:58.530
Do people generally think that this is a good system or do you think it's a bad

110
00:06:58.531 --> 00:07:00.990
system?
Are they just indifferent?
They accepted as a way of life.

111
00:07:01.260 --> 00:07:03.820
<v 0>I just beginning in the thousand and 12,</v>

112
00:07:03.890 --> 00:07:08.800
[inaudible] introduces a Internet filtering system and the contract general

113
00:07:08.801 --> 00:07:12.900
public was not very interested in this.
And I,

114
00:07:13.200 --> 00:07:16.410
if you didn't notice any attention to this issue.
So we try to,

115
00:07:16.700 --> 00:07:20.760
to attract a lot of attentions but will fail.
But after then,
I,

116
00:07:20.820 --> 00:07:25.180
a few years ago was a Kremlin made two big mistakes,

117
00:07:25.690 --> 00:07:29.580
uh,
as a Caribbean blocked,
uh,
the,

118
00:07:29.630 --> 00:07:32.200
as the most popular torrent websites in the country.

119
00:07:32.650 --> 00:07:36.370
And then they tried to block porn hub after that.

120
00:07:36.850 --> 00:07:37.683
Even people,

121
00:07:39.100 --> 00:07:44.100
even people who have never been interested in Russian politics are in politics

122
00:07:44.291 --> 00:07:48.700
at all.
Uh,
started learning how to use circumvention tools.

123
00:07:49.810 --> 00:07:54.630
<v 3>So the Russia in a week after his biggest passion to run the website was</v>

124
00:07:54.750 --> 00:07:55.140
blocked.

125
00:07:55.140 --> 00:07:57.730
<v 2>The trait,
you mean Vittoria the illegal file sharing service.</v>

126
00:07:58.220 --> 00:07:59.053
<v 3>Yeah.</v>

127
00:07:59.270 --> 00:08:03.680
So almost immediately in a big rush has skyrocketed to the second position and

128
00:08:03.681 --> 00:08:07.190
the number of total users.
Now we are second on that is in other states

129
00:08:07.370 --> 00:08:09.570
<v 2>toward the,
the anonymous routing service.</v>

130
00:08:09.830 --> 00:08:13.870
<v 3>Yes.
These famous VPN,
which is provided for free.</v>

131
00:08:14.660 --> 00:08:15.021
<v 2>Got It.</v>

132
00:08:15.021 --> 00:08:18.920
So as long as they don't go after your illegal file sharing or your pornography,

133
00:08:18.921 --> 00:08:22.040
it's all good.
But once they cross those lines,
people got agitated,

134
00:08:22.260 --> 00:08:23.093
upset the thing.

135
00:08:25.460 --> 00:08:27.470
Has there been any on the political side,

136
00:08:27.471 --> 00:08:31.220
any mobilization or any cases where anyone has engaged in the same way?

137
00:08:31.490 --> 00:08:33.360
<v 3>Yeah,
I think so because,
uh,</v>

138
00:08:33.410 --> 00:08:38.040
in use is idea of internet filter and it was sold to the public on the pretext

139
00:08:38.041 --> 00:08:42.510
of protecting children against pedophiles and against people who spreads and

140
00:08:42.511 --> 00:08:45.290
suicidal notes.
Something really strange.

141
00:08:45.710 --> 00:08:49.290
But people accepted this because it's all about children.
Uh,

142
00:08:49.430 --> 00:08:54.350
but five years passed and now everybody understood it's not about wow children.

143
00:08:54.351 --> 00:08:58.950
That's about politics and the vizio.
We got a street protest actually in Moscow.

144
00:08:58.951 --> 00:09:02.170
We got Marsha's,
we got,
uh,
we got big events and uh,

145
00:09:02.520 --> 00:09:05.500
as a Russian pilot parts here organize some of his events.
And if you get,

146
00:09:05.570 --> 00:09:09.300
if you've got falling off people protesting in the Russian pirate party.
Yes.

147
00:09:09.330 --> 00:09:12.270
It's a very popular thing and come so far.

148
00:09:12.271 --> 00:09:16.410
But actually they monitor a lot of things about Internet censorship and also

149
00:09:16.411 --> 00:09:19.650
we're trying to organize some things offline and there's,

150
00:09:19.660 --> 00:09:23.460
the latest a protest was really huge.
It was about thousands of people.

151
00:09:23.730 --> 00:09:28.380
That's very cool.
Um,
isn't the pirate party running Iceland incidentally?
Exactly.

152
00:09:28.440 --> 00:09:28.960
Yeah.
Okay.

153
00:09:28.960 --> 00:09:32.700
It's a big inspiration for all branches of the pirate parts everywhere.
Huh.

154
00:09:33.090 --> 00:09:37.540
Very cool.
So turning to technology a little bit,
um,
is there anything

155
00:09:37.600 --> 00:09:39.250
<v 2>you can share,
you mentioned earlier that,
you know,</v>

156
00:09:39.251 --> 00:09:42.190
there's this technological censorship regime in Russia,

157
00:09:42.250 --> 00:09:44.220
but it sounds like it's only effective to a point.
Yeah.

158
00:09:44.610 --> 00:09:48.750
<v 3>Why is that?
Well,
I think that's a problem is that when you have,</v>

159
00:09:49.200 --> 00:09:53.120
is the Internet in Account Chair built for almost 20 years,
uh,

160
00:09:53.320 --> 00:09:57.390
it does about any kind of,
uh,
uh,
intrusion from the government.

161
00:09:57.600 --> 00:10:00.660
And that was the case for Russia for,
yeah,
for almost 20 years.

162
00:10:00.661 --> 00:10:05.040
From 1991 to 2011.
Um,
it's actually,

163
00:10:05.041 --> 00:10:09.150
it's extremely difficult technological it to add this element of censorship and

164
00:10:09.151 --> 00:10:13.610
filtering,
you need to breads a redesign already fine.

165
00:10:13.920 --> 00:10:17.550
The entire infrastructure of the Internet.
It's,
um,

166
00:10:17.730 --> 00:10:21.960
it's extremely difficult as a rationale for just found out last year they even

167
00:10:21.961 --> 00:10:25.850
tried to enlist some support from Chinese as a Chinese.
Uh,

168
00:10:25.900 --> 00:10:27.660
went to Moscow said like,
we are happy to,

169
00:10:27.661 --> 00:10:30.030
how bad do you need to get rid of all American equipment?

170
00:10:30.300 --> 00:10:31.530
It's a problem is about that.
It's a,

171
00:10:31.531 --> 00:10:36.531
it's really difficult to counter to place say in one day old Cisco and such a

172
00:10:36.961 --> 00:10:40.530
big country,
we have something produced in China.
Uh,

173
00:10:40.531 --> 00:10:45.120
so that's why I know about trying to find the way hard to remodel the critical

174
00:10:45.210 --> 00:10:48.960
infrastructure of the Internet in Russia.
But it's,
um,

175
00:10:49.350 --> 00:10:53.210
it's a very tricky and I don't see any mal successes so far.

176
00:10:53.400 --> 00:10:57.950
<v 0>Uh,
initially,
uh,
I,
in fact ours was the rational story.</v>

177
00:10:57.951 --> 00:11:02.951
This was frightened at to replace as an American to equipment buys a Chinese

178
00:11:03.280 --> 00:11:06.070
equipment,
Chinese offer it to,

179
00:11:06.240 --> 00:11:10.230
to put into the system who I always equate highway equipment.

180
00:11:10.280 --> 00:11:14.370
And so that's what frightened for the Russian security services because cause I

181
00:11:14.371 --> 00:11:16.580
am very suspicious to Chinese,
Chinese.
Yeah.

182
00:11:16.840 --> 00:11:20.240
Solid also invented the US.

183
00:11:20.610 --> 00:11:23.160
<v 2>Well I don't think you need to convince that room of Google or is that doing a</v>

184
00:11:23.161 --> 00:11:27.490
whole scale infrastructure,
a swap out is going to be technologically hard.
Um,

185
00:11:28.380 --> 00:11:31.740
how about on the sort of consumer side?
Do you know you guys are,
are,
you know,

186
00:11:31.770 --> 00:11:35.850
individual actors,
um,
you know,
you don't have the resources of a large player.

187
00:11:35.880 --> 00:11:40.080
How do you use technology in your work?
Is it a force for good?
Is it a hindrance?

188
00:11:40.290 --> 00:11:41.220
What are your thoughts on that?

189
00:11:41.680 --> 00:11:46.680
<v 0>Is all technology wouldn't be who they are because we set up our website</v>

190
00:11:47.390 --> 00:11:52.280
[inaudible] dot [inaudible] back into south by commercial Salzman and a very

191
00:11:52.281 --> 00:11:54.940
young journalists.
We didn't have any,
uh,

192
00:11:55.090 --> 00:11:58.550
any money to pay for peninsula calls for paper.
Uh,

193
00:11:58.660 --> 00:12:01.230
and about Avaya,

194
00:12:01.240 --> 00:12:04.160
spend a little money for months,
uh,

195
00:12:04.290 --> 00:12:09.290
maintaining our websites and the cost us a very cheap we can do,

196
00:12:11.440 --> 00:12:13.450
we can continue doing our work.

197
00:12:13.770 --> 00:12:17.010
<v 3>And also it's a,
it's actually,
it's extremely important for us because,
um,</v>

198
00:12:17.190 --> 00:12:18.910
for many reasons it's a,

199
00:12:19.110 --> 00:12:24.110
now it's became really difficult to find a place for publishing your stories in

200
00:12:24.661 --> 00:12:28.580
the country.
Uh,
it's not a coincidence what we have,
uh,

201
00:12:28.770 --> 00:12:31.110
both of our books signs it first was published in the thousand and 10.

202
00:12:31.230 --> 00:12:35.120
It's was all about the Russian secret services as the second one read web and

203
00:12:35.130 --> 00:12:38.690
the both of them that publish it first in the United States.
Uh,

204
00:12:38.730 --> 00:12:43.620
but to communicate before publisher,
of course you need technology.
Uh,
and,

205
00:12:43.621 --> 00:12:48.570
uh,
thanks to Skype and Google hangout a while you,
you,
you,

206
00:12:48.580 --> 00:12:53.450
you can do my be in Moscow still communication,
uh,
with,

207
00:12:53.490 --> 00:12:57.150
uh,
if your editors and publishers,
which is a great thing.
And also of course,

208
00:12:57.151 --> 00:13:02.050
it's helps us to gather intelligence,
information and intelligence and uh,

209
00:13:02.880 --> 00:13:06.560
in a way,
because you kind of use all kinds of,
uh,
things like net,

210
00:13:06.561 --> 00:13:08.930
they're mining and now it's extremely important.
Uh,

211
00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:14.000
in Russia you can use all these databases and you can find some really exposing

212
00:13:15.330 --> 00:13:20.250
stuff.
Uh,
like some years ago,
thanks to one database we found out that,
uh,

213
00:13:20.251 --> 00:13:22.140
now we have in Russia,

214
00:13:22.141 --> 00:13:26.670
not one system of online surveillance mansard by one security service,

215
00:13:26.671 --> 00:13:31.360
but eight of them honey.
He different systems online surveillance.
Yes.

216
00:13:31.370 --> 00:13:35.700
I build sa about superintendents led by eight agencies.
Uh,

217
00:13:35.790 --> 00:13:36.570
and uh,

218
00:13:36.570 --> 00:13:40.470
we just found out that thanks to data mining because officially you cannot get

219
00:13:40.471 --> 00:13:45.120
any,
uh,
any Coleman's from various agencies because it's considered to be state

220
00:13:45.121 --> 00:13:48.090
cigarette and sometimes technology switch,
uh,

221
00:13:48.480 --> 00:13:52.980
not meant to be used by journalists.
Uh,

222
00:13:53.070 --> 00:13:55.560
bow proved to be extremely helpful.
For example,

223
00:13:55.590 --> 00:14:00.160
drones and a while,
some years ago,
I think he's about seven years ago,
80,

224
00:14:00.170 --> 00:14:04.220
and that had a very big investigation about the luxury villas.

225
00:14:04.470 --> 00:14:08.970
They should be given for free to the FSB Russian security services generals.

226
00:14:09.570 --> 00:14:12.670
And I think that time you never fought what you can actually approach it.

227
00:14:13.070 --> 00:14:17.040
<v 0>It was impossible to pro.
I got information,
I checked all documents.
Uh,</v>

228
00:14:17.041 --> 00:14:20.990
it was clear as large as his generals,
uh,
just grabbed a state,

229
00:14:21.080 --> 00:14:22.760
a state real estate for free.

230
00:14:22.820 --> 00:14:27.820
And my day I had no chance to abroad does Israel state and,

231
00:14:28.910 --> 00:14:32.930
and take a picture because it was very well guarded by the security to Samosas

232
00:14:33.030 --> 00:14:37.700
and uh,
and uh,
it was hidden arms are huge fans and that challenge sales.

233
00:14:37.701 --> 00:14:41.480
But now I could,
I can do this easily to wants a drone.

234
00:14:42.960 --> 00:14:46.820
<v 3>Actually we got,
uh,
yeah,
some,
some interesting things.
So on,
uh,</v>

235
00:14:46.830 --> 00:14:51.720
available on a [inaudible],
uh,
it's mostly done by,
uh,

236
00:14:51.740 --> 00:14:55.820
Russian opposition leader in the wireless team.
And they got this team of,

237
00:14:55.880 --> 00:14:58.730
and they can actually be a launch,
a drone souls the time.

238
00:14:58.970 --> 00:15:02.660
And the most recent example,
they just,
I think it was three weeks ago,

239
00:15:02.661 --> 00:15:04.760
we exposed and use secret,

240
00:15:04.790 --> 00:15:09.790
a luxury villa renovated specifically for a Putin's personal use.

241
00:15:11.060 --> 00:15:15.910
And it's a,
it's,
it's crazy for this.
You can see everything and uh,

242
00:15:16.260 --> 00:15:17.480
pallets.
It's amazing.

243
00:15:17.770 --> 00:15:20.160
<v 2>And it's on Youtube.
You say exactly.
That's how they get to,</v>

244
00:15:21.470 --> 00:15:23.720
you mentioned that there are eight different agencies.

245
00:15:23.840 --> 00:15:25.550
Can you give a little bit more color on that?

246
00:15:25.551 --> 00:15:28.030
The kind of things that they're looking at?
I mean,
you,

247
00:15:28.031 --> 00:15:30.830
you said earlier that they're filtering,
you know,
Internet stuff,

248
00:15:30.831 --> 00:15:31.910
but with eight different agencies,

249
00:15:31.911 --> 00:15:33.620
is that all they're doing or are there other activities?

250
00:15:34.060 --> 00:15:36.120
<v 3>No,
of course be they have other activities to do,</v>

251
00:15:36.190 --> 00:15:38.800
but we have the right to conduct these kinds of situations.

252
00:15:39.010 --> 00:15:43.120
So because now we had this climate,
uh,
in Russia by attacks,
actually,

253
00:15:43.121 --> 00:15:46.720
if you ask for some funds for the secret services all,
it's fine.

254
00:15:46.721 --> 00:15:48.790
We're going to put you in this very hybrid to provide those funds.

255
00:15:49.020 --> 00:15:53.740
So is the agencies just use this opportunity to build their own systems of a

256
00:15:53.741 --> 00:15:56.890
online store balance?
The tricky thing about this surveillance,

257
00:15:56.891 --> 00:16:00.340
which is it's not like muscle balance,

258
00:16:01.320 --> 00:16:04.790
uh,
because there are still some technical problems,
uh,

259
00:16:04.810 --> 00:16:07.810
for the Russian secret services are,
especially for example,

260
00:16:07.811 --> 00:16:10.060
they do not know how to build huge databases.

261
00:16:10.480 --> 00:16:13.960
They still rely on American technologists like Oracle Ivans.
Uh,
to be honest,

262
00:16:13.990 --> 00:16:18.400
even the internal database of,
as the FSB is built on Oracle.

263
00:16:18.730 --> 00:16:21.790
Wow.
Uh,
so they,
they do not know how to do those things.

264
00:16:22.050 --> 00:16:25.270
So instead of mass surveillance where do targeted surveillance,

265
00:16:25.600 --> 00:16:29.230
which means that we need first to know who should be spied on and when they

266
00:16:29.231 --> 00:16:34.150
started the thing.
But in a way it's extremely effective in making,

267
00:16:35.090 --> 00:16:39.310
uh,
the IT industry in the Russia complicit in these activities because what

268
00:16:39.311 --> 00:16:40.380
actually it means admins.

269
00:16:40.400 --> 00:16:45.400
But if you are small or big Internet service provider in Moscow or in any town,

270
00:16:46.781 --> 00:16:50.410
you need to get a license in one of the finger in his license is a,

271
00:16:50.411 --> 00:16:54.590
you are required to install I special equipment,
so called black box,
uh,

272
00:16:54.591 --> 00:16:58.510
of uh,
which actually a backdoor for that you need to get,

273
00:16:58.600 --> 00:17:03.490
um,
a plan of implementation from the local branch of safe is B.

274
00:17:03.790 --> 00:17:07.390
And actually it means that you need to get along with his guys and you're

275
00:17:07.391 --> 00:17:11.850
provided a contact number.
Uh,
so a guy from the local branch cause all of us,

276
00:17:11.980 --> 00:17:16.870
uh,
about coal year and ask for some favors.
And also you have physical,

277
00:17:16.930 --> 00:17:21.930
a cable which connects your servers with the local branch of safe is B.

278
00:17:22.540 --> 00:17:26.320
And you know nothing about what actually is intercepted on your services because

279
00:17:26.321 --> 00:17:30.010
it's all state secret and you have no security clearance as ISP.

280
00:17:30.011 --> 00:17:34.210
You have no access sometimes even to the room where you have this black box.

281
00:17:34.410 --> 00:17:37.390
So it's actually,
it's a back door,
but also it's a phone number.

282
00:17:37.720 --> 00:17:42.460
So you might be one day asked for to set down some website or my bid to look

283
00:17:42.461 --> 00:17:47.100
into some someone's,
um,
Mao emails accounts and to provide it to,

284
00:17:47.110 --> 00:17:48.280
to the FSB as a favor.

285
00:17:48.700 --> 00:17:53.700
<v 0>How do decide who to target?
So that's complicated.
Uh,</v>

286
00:17:53.890 --> 00:17:55.860
um,
in fact,
uh,

287
00:17:56.230 --> 00:18:01.020
they have to combat crimes but aside crimes,
uh,

288
00:18:01.320 --> 00:18:06.010
nausea,
uh,
one of the environment in,
in,

289
00:18:06.030 --> 00:18:11.030
in particular region or in most say and die and adjust the patrols,

290
00:18:13.080 --> 00:18:15.690
uh,
was a victim.
Uh,
usually,

291
00:18:15.750 --> 00:18:18.660
mostly this is a person who was known for,

292
00:18:18.690 --> 00:18:23.270
for his or political activity or some oppositional activity or publishing,

293
00:18:23.280 --> 00:18:26.860
Samsung,
Samsung,
critical of the Kremlin.
And one's a,

294
00:18:27.180 --> 00:18:29.790
one's a designated this as a standard.

295
00:18:30.090 --> 00:18:34.130
As I started to monitor all his activity on the Internet.
And,
uh,

296
00:18:34.270 --> 00:18:36.990
this is enough for our,

297
00:18:37.110 --> 00:18:40.850
sometimes it's enough for sending hemophilia to prison for,
oh,

298
00:18:40.950 --> 00:18:42.450
let me give one example.

299
00:18:42.660 --> 00:18:47.660
One guy was sent to prison for two years on the foot Boston on his,

300
00:18:47.900 --> 00:18:48.300
uh,

301
00:18:48.300 --> 00:18:52.890
on his page or on a social network [inaudible] which was modeled after Facebook,

302
00:18:53.100 --> 00:18:57.300
somewhat popular in Russia.
Uh,
a big draws off of,
uh,
of,

303
00:18:57.390 --> 00:18:59.350
of two spaced,
um,

304
00:18:59.640 --> 00:19:04.640
of a tube of toothpaste and southern clause was alike or legs squeeze Russia out

305
00:19:05.911 --> 00:19:10.320
of yourself.
I got two years.
Sorry.
I don't understand it.

306
00:19:10.321 --> 00:19:12.870
Was it two faces has squeeze Russia out of your,

307
00:19:13.960 --> 00:19:17.720
she'll spiced and squeeze Russia out of yourself.
That's Rosa phobic.

308
00:19:17.900 --> 00:19:20.820
W what does it even saying though?
Does it,
what does that mean?

309
00:19:21.650 --> 00:19:24.480
Nobody actually to understand is there was an allusion is that,

310
00:19:24.830 --> 00:19:28.330
is that as an allusion to,
to,
to uh,
to Samsung cough,
rash and right.

311
00:19:28.331 --> 00:19:32.080
The chair off are,
that means you need to,
um,
Korea is a slave.

312
00:19:32.570 --> 00:19:37.200
A slave when it from yourself.
Okay.
But at the same time,
it's all really stupid.

313
00:19:37.220 --> 00:19:41.190
That's doesn't mean it named got him two years in prison.
Yes.
Wow.

314
00:19:42.300 --> 00:19:45.570
Have you had near brushes with,
with those kinds of experiences?

315
00:19:46.440 --> 00:19:49.370
<v 3>Well,
we,
as I said,
we started many years ago.</v>

316
00:19:49.470 --> 00:19:53.550
I think it was two falls in 1999 to four hours.
And then of course,
uh,

317
00:19:53.910 --> 00:19:58.030
back then actually it started very older for us older than the falls.

318
00:19:58.031 --> 00:20:02.540
And then Toby got very felt criminal investigation against us.
Uh,

319
00:20:02.610 --> 00:20:07.350
and sometimes it's really,
um,
um,
I would say,

320
00:20:07.620 --> 00:20:11.220
well do you feel really nervous because we isn't corrugation cyber I conducted

321
00:20:11.230 --> 00:20:15.390
in a prison actually,
and just by chance,
so you would never know,

322
00:20:15.830 --> 00:20:19.740
ah,
what might happen to you next.
Uh,
and uh,
maybe you would stay,

323
00:20:19.741 --> 00:20:22.230
there might be not a,
it's a,
it's a big question,

324
00:20:22.650 --> 00:20:25.230
but I would say that we've full,

325
00:20:25.320 --> 00:20:28.710
well if you tried to and lot to understand how things changed,

326
00:20:28.980 --> 00:20:32.040
I would say that today is,
the tactics became much more supple.

327
00:20:32.490 --> 00:20:36.300
So back then it was mostly about targeting individual journalists.
Uh,

328
00:20:36.301 --> 00:20:41.301
and now it's about how to deal with editors and owners of the media and which

329
00:20:42.840 --> 00:20:46.830
results in the situation when you cannot find a place to get your stuff.

330
00:20:47.920 --> 00:20:51.580
And you cannot say that look,
um,
in a way it's,

331
00:20:51.700 --> 00:20:54.310
it's worse because when you have a,

332
00:20:54.311 --> 00:20:57.730
someone a is targeted by buys a Kremlin,

333
00:20:58.240 --> 00:21:02.920
it means what it at least with journalists could,
uh,
uh,
could apply to public.

334
00:21:03.130 --> 00:21:06.840
He might make his case public and say,
look,
I'm a victim of,
uh,

335
00:21:06.870 --> 00:21:09.820
this kind of pressure,
but now solid kind of management problem.

336
00:21:09.910 --> 00:21:11.650
It's between you and you editor,

337
00:21:11.970 --> 00:21:14.040
<v 2>right?
It's the same philosophy where there is the cable,</v>

338
00:21:14.041 --> 00:21:15.660
but there's also the phone number.
Right?

339
00:21:15.720 --> 00:21:19.090
And it's all kind of done manual through d.
Yeah,
very manual.

340
00:21:19.120 --> 00:21:21.210
That's a good way to think about it.
Um,

341
00:21:21.450 --> 00:21:24.360
and you mentioned earlier that your book was published in the US was,

342
00:21:24.361 --> 00:21:27.330
it was published here before Russia,
is that correct?
Why is that?

343
00:21:27.780 --> 00:21:28.650
<v 3>Uh,
because,
uh,</v>

344
00:21:28.730 --> 00:21:33.730
Russian publishers today then not very well understood the risks and,

345
00:21:34.891 --> 00:21:39.450
um,
because it's a long story for us.
So we started publishing this stuff in,
uh,

346
00:21:39.800 --> 00:21:44.190
in,
in the west,
maybe in 2010,
2009.

347
00:21:44.430 --> 00:21:46.020
So we had kind of experience,

348
00:21:46.021 --> 00:21:48.690
and it's really interesting that Russell Publications,

349
00:21:48.750 --> 00:21:50.610
they sometimes they pick up your stories,

350
00:21:52.140 --> 00:21:56.490
but only after they,
uh,
uh,
they,
they published it,

351
00:21:56.510 --> 00:22:00.210
buys a Western publications and they always ask to,

352
00:22:00.300 --> 00:22:01.800
to maintain these byline.

353
00:22:01.890 --> 00:22:06.000
But first time this was published in English and say it's the Gotcha.
Okay.
So,

354
00:22:06.001 --> 00:22:09.370
so it's helps them to shift responsibility and to sell.

355
00:22:09.880 --> 00:22:14.680
It was already published somewhere.
And the same goes with the books,
a survey,

356
00:22:14.700 --> 00:22:19.440
say a bowel,
the maybe one day we are hyper to publish your book,

357
00:22:19.441 --> 00:22:23.090
but first get one published in the West and actually buy those happen.
We,

358
00:22:23.091 --> 00:22:28.040
we got our book finally published in Russia,
but only after it was published in,

359
00:22:28.760 --> 00:22:29.970
uh,
in the United States.

360
00:22:30.090 --> 00:22:32.490
<v 2>So sort of a boomerang outside and strategist.</v>

361
00:22:33.030 --> 00:22:36.210
And I'm actually surprised to hear that you were able to publish your book in

362
00:22:36.211 --> 00:22:37.800
Russia at all.
Well,
why is that?

363
00:22:38.140 --> 00:22:41.170
<v 3>Maybe because of Phil's book was,
uh,
became Apicella.</v>

364
00:22:41.560 --> 00:22:45.700
[inaudible] actually had met a lot of money for the publisher in regulations and

365
00:22:45.701 --> 00:22:47.350
uh,
not for us.

366
00:22:48.290 --> 00:22:53.290
Dolan says Basa at the was a really strange moment in Russian history because it

367
00:22:53.831 --> 00:22:58.070
was,
uh,
September of 2011.
And uh,

368
00:22:58.270 --> 00:23:02.290
the book was just published and the FSB was not very hyper surveys send some

369
00:23:02.320 --> 00:23:02.801
letters.

370
00:23:02.801 --> 00:23:07.080
Actually we sent some people to for some strange reasons why decided to these

371
00:23:07.180 --> 00:23:11.050
the present house.
Why?
Yeah,
I don't,
I don't,
I still don't know.

372
00:23:11.090 --> 00:23:13.280
<v 2>So security services showed up at the printing house.</v>

373
00:23:13.780 --> 00:23:15.790
<v 3>Yes.
Nothing's officers of the publisher buttons,</v>

374
00:23:15.791 --> 00:23:19.660
a printing house and asking crazy questions like who paid for the preaching of

375
00:23:19.661 --> 00:23:23.450
the book and everybody's okay pop a publisher.
But uh,

376
00:23:23.560 --> 00:23:27.790
and we were really nervous bots.
Then we got these Moscow protests.

377
00:23:27.970 --> 00:23:31.740
So the FSB,
uh,
very soon they had some other things to do,

378
00:23:32.090 --> 00:23:33.880
we needed to deal with or face political crisis.

379
00:23:34.400 --> 00:23:36.530
<v 2>And did they ever come back to the printing house?
No,</v>

380
00:23:36.531 --> 00:23:41.030
they forgot about it completely.
And whatever works,
I guess it's all people.

381
00:23:41.031 --> 00:23:43.590
And that's one of the themes that I think if the points you've been making that

382
00:23:43.990 --> 00:23:48.470
there is a technology,
but it really is as much manual is it is automatic.
Yeah.

383
00:23:48.750 --> 00:23:51.560
So looking forward a little bit and we're going to pause in a few minutes.

384
00:23:51.561 --> 00:23:52.910
So folks that have questions as we go,

385
00:23:52.911 --> 00:23:56.240
just be jotting them down and then we'll open it up for any audience questions

386
00:23:56.241 --> 00:23:58.280
momentarily.
But before we do that,

387
00:23:58.400 --> 00:24:02.690
I just want to turn to the future a little bit.
Um,
where do you see things going?

388
00:24:04.370 --> 00:24:05.870
<v 0>Huh,
Huh?
Yeah.</v>

389
00:24:05.940 --> 00:24:10.080
You know about John Willis than we had to predict future and always failed.

390
00:24:10.620 --> 00:24:12.360
But even even,
uh,

391
00:24:12.460 --> 00:24:15.950
Watson cause absolutely predictable is that London we'll put in will be as any

392
00:24:15.951 --> 00:24:18.980
new Russian president next year.
Yeah.

393
00:24:19.500 --> 00:24:22.020
<v 3>All right,
Bob.
Well,
I think that,
uh,</v>

394
00:24:22.170 --> 00:24:26.820
if you try to see is the whole thing,
maybe we still have some,

395
00:24:26.821 --> 00:24:30.280
some sorts for hope because it looks like we have the Internet,
uh,

396
00:24:30.390 --> 00:24:35.390
as a criminal on face as a formidable challenge because it's historically the

397
00:24:35.930 --> 00:24:40.590
whole Russian history actually,
ah,
has been defined and by hierarchical order.

398
00:24:41.280 --> 00:24:45.750
Uh,
we all this had someone on the voter top while Conan shots.

399
00:24:46.080 --> 00:24:46.501
It was,

400
00:24:46.501 --> 00:24:50.220
maybe it's a zoll maybe as an emperor or my visit leader of the Communist Party.

401
00:24:51.150 --> 00:24:54.330
But right now,
uh,
we are Gielan VFS situation.

402
00:24:54.331 --> 00:24:57.670
What we have is we have the network,
we have our,

403
00:24:57.690 --> 00:25:02.690
which is by definition is a horizontal Keisha and it looks like the Kremlin has

404
00:25:02.761 --> 00:25:06.870
some problems understanding the nature of the network.

405
00:25:07.400 --> 00:25:11.940
Um,
just pretty big.
Three years ago we had an excellent example.

406
00:25:11.970 --> 00:25:15.300
Uh,
there was a case against his guy,
the Waianae,

407
00:25:15.380 --> 00:25:19.750
and he was about to be sent to jail and some,
some of his people,
I,

408
00:25:19.751 --> 00:25:22.410
they wanted to mobilize people to protest.

409
00:25:22.440 --> 00:25:24.630
So we'll launch the protest group on Facebook.

410
00:25:25.020 --> 00:25:29.100
And this group was immediately a two down by taking down,
by,
by Facebook,

411
00:25:29.101 --> 00:25:30.630
under request of the Russian government.

412
00:25:31.320 --> 00:25:35.820
And immediately if got a lot of people are treasured Bobby's story,

413
00:25:35.900 --> 00:25:38.520
launching their own pages,
uh,

414
00:25:38.521 --> 00:25:43.140
asking people to God to get a to a particular place in Moscow.

415
00:25:43.200 --> 00:25:44.670
And,
uh,
as a result,

416
00:25:44.671 --> 00:25:48.570
we got tons of Falzone's people protesting on the Moscow streets.

417
00:25:49.200 --> 00:25:53.070
10 thousands of people spontaneously,
but kind of stay just black lab.

418
00:25:53.700 --> 00:25:58.140
So I think via Sphinx is still very difficult for the client to understand and

419
00:25:58.141 --> 00:25:59.640
it gives us some hope.

420
00:25:59.980 --> 00:26:00.140
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

421
00:26:00.140 --> 00:26:04.750
But still believes is that the Internet is ruled by some guys who was a top and

422
00:26:04.751 --> 00:26:06.160
his science.
This is a CA.

423
00:26:06.530 --> 00:26:08.470
<v 3>Yeah.
Actually that really,
yeah,
he actually has,
yeah.</v>

424
00:26:09.250 --> 00:26:14.110
<v 0>Saturday as a CIA.
Internet was a creation.</v>

425
00:26:15.010 --> 00:26:19.860
<v 2>Hmm.
And,
and in general,
how do they think about technology?
So that's one,</v>

426
00:26:19.890 --> 00:26:22.680
you know,
data point.
How do you think,
you know,

427
00:26:22.681 --> 00:26:25.350
five years from now there'll be sort of conceptualizing the internet?

428
00:26:26.170 --> 00:26:26.321
<v 3>Well,</v>

429
00:26:26.321 --> 00:26:30.130
in our business and in before for the media to be all about social media and we

430
00:26:30.140 --> 00:26:32.380
already have some interesting things,

431
00:26:32.381 --> 00:26:37.381
but people tried to abandon the idea of domain names from a media.

432
00:26:37.870 --> 00:26:40.150
Uh,
they actually been moved to social media.

433
00:26:40.750 --> 00:26:44.460
So we have some recent project and [inaudible] project and which was launched

434
00:26:44.760 --> 00:26:46.160
solely on social media.

435
00:26:46.180 --> 00:26:50.640
They have a page on Facebook of page on contacted and something on medium.com.

436
00:26:50.910 --> 00:26:54.810
That's all.
And it's not only because we believe in the idea of social media,

437
00:26:54.811 --> 00:26:59.550
but also because it's more secure.
Once you have a website and domain name,

438
00:26:59.551 --> 00:27:00.690
it might be blocked,

439
00:27:00.810 --> 00:27:04.920
you might get some visitors and if you have everything based on social media,

440
00:27:05.340 --> 00:27:09.690
but provides you with some opportunity and a simultaneously some people who

441
00:27:09.691 --> 00:27:13.350
still believe in the idea of domain names that I think that now maybe it's time

442
00:27:13.351 --> 00:27:18.300
to,
to move to Google because it's also big issue,
uh,

443
00:27:18.330 --> 00:27:21.360
for safe as a contraceptive authoritarian regimes.

444
00:27:21.540 --> 00:27:25.500
One thing is to blog a website of a particular media.
It's easier,

445
00:27:25.710 --> 00:27:28.880
especially if it's a Russian registered registrator it's uh,

446
00:27:28.940 --> 00:27:32.430
but if it's based on,
it's actually physically on Google,

447
00:27:32.460 --> 00:27:35.670
it means if you want to block it,
you need to deal with the whole Google.

448
00:27:35.671 --> 00:27:40.670
And it's such a sensitive thing for many that even in the countries so far,

449
00:27:40.740 --> 00:27:44.670
Central Asia,
and they're usually,
they're not that subtle,

450
00:27:45.180 --> 00:27:49.320
they're still hesitant and they do not know what to do with his new phenomenon

451
00:27:49.350 --> 00:27:53.070
that many media might be physically based on Google services.

452
00:27:53.340 --> 00:27:55.800
They just don't know how to deal with this program.

453
00:27:55.801 --> 00:28:00.560
So maybe that provides us again,
some sense of,
uh,
some,
some,

454
00:28:00.680 --> 00:28:02.160
some,
maybe some sorts of help.

455
00:28:03.090 --> 00:28:06.900
Do you foresee any changes to the policies or the laws or the enforcements

456
00:28:06.901 --> 00:28:11.880
around that?
While the problem is that we have this problem as idea of,

457
00:28:11.881 --> 00:28:16.020
um,
uh,
of localization,
the idea that,
uh,

458
00:28:16.021 --> 00:28:20.730
ahead with the stone,
but the Balkanization of the Internet,
unfortunately it's,

459
00:28:20.731 --> 00:28:22.920
it's such a great idea for many,

460
00:28:23.220 --> 00:28:26.150
especially in Russia and China will loves idea of a brand that,

461
00:28:26.250 --> 00:28:29.790
a digital surveillance here and erase.
So veterans sovereignty,

462
00:28:29.820 --> 00:28:34.140
sovereign digital sovereignty,
uh,
and it's basically,
it's about borders.

463
00:28:34.740 --> 00:28:39.240
Like we have our territory and it's,
it's a,

464
00:28:39.241 --> 00:28:43.920
it's a limited by borders.
We need to have exactly the same thing,
uh,
uh,

465
00:28:43.940 --> 00:28:44.970
on the Internet.

466
00:28:45.000 --> 00:28:50.000
And the idea is that if you have some service at might be Facebook,

467
00:28:50.401 --> 00:28:55.230
Twitter,
any,
anything,
uh,
Google,
you need to,
uh,
have,
uh,

468
00:28:55.250 --> 00:28:59.850
old servers.
They have the Russian,
uh,
with this particular country,

469
00:29:00.050 --> 00:29:02.640
a citizen's data on this territory.

470
00:29:02.760 --> 00:29:06.090
Just to be able to access it easily and to manipulate.

471
00:29:06.091 --> 00:29:11.091
Maybe it is data and unfortunately it's a very appealing idea to many because

472
00:29:12.241 --> 00:29:16.110
it's a,
it's something about patriotism.
Like,
yes,
we are.
For example,

473
00:29:16.111 --> 00:29:18.360
we bought some meeting with the Russian officials and they,

474
00:29:18.750 --> 00:29:20.130
they said very openly,
yes,

475
00:29:20.131 --> 00:29:22.470
we are very grateful to as Americans we invented the whole thing.

476
00:29:22.500 --> 00:29:26.310
But now it's time for us to control our space.

477
00:29:26.640 --> 00:29:31.230
It's about our sense of,
uh,
of the national state.

478
00:29:31.550 --> 00:29:36.510
<v 0>Mm.
It was a great opportunity for security to sauces to get access to users.</v>

479
00:29:38.090 --> 00:29:41.060
Jose,
Jose,
they're not able to,
uh,

480
00:29:41.120 --> 00:29:44.220
to just buy owns on the site,

481
00:29:44.230 --> 00:29:49.090
on the services are located abroad because it was,
I can't,

482
00:29:49.860 --> 00:29:52.510
uh,
as I can find that direct access to.

483
00:29:53.250 --> 00:29:57.150
<v 2>So last question before return to the audience overall,
are you an optimist?</v>

484
00:29:57.151 --> 00:29:59.730
The pessimist?
Do you think that,
you know,

485
00:30:00.030 --> 00:30:03.300
the Internet will be a force for good five,
10 years from now?
Or do you think,

486
00:30:03.600 --> 00:30:06.390
you know,
we're sort of in this unique window in history that's going to close?

487
00:30:06.840 --> 00:30:09.120
<v 3>Well,
you know that Alan just started writing the whole book.</v>

488
00:30:09.121 --> 00:30:11.640
I will publish an American publisher said,
look,

489
00:30:11.641 --> 00:30:15.270
you need to add something optimistic and sand of your book because otherwise why

490
00:30:15.271 --> 00:30:19.320
to read it.
And
finally we thought,
wow,

491
00:30:19.900 --> 00:30:23.530
might be better.
It's significant in the end VI's idea.
But seriously,
no,

492
00:30:23.790 --> 00:30:24.570
the optimists,

493
00:30:24.570 --> 00:30:28.980
they believe that we right now it's a,

494
00:30:29.040 --> 00:30:31.710
we have these opportunities can uh,

495
00:30:31.740 --> 00:30:36.740
we can publish those kinds of stories and it's old and thanks to technology and

496
00:30:37.051 --> 00:30:41.790
it looks like for the Kremlin they might know some tricks.
Bots.

497
00:30:41.791 --> 00:30:45.270
It's really difficult for them to catch up if US development of technologies.

498
00:30:45.660 --> 00:30:49.330
And also the problem is,
which also gives me some hope,
uh,

499
00:30:49.350 --> 00:30:54.130
just Vizhier [inaudible] you information security doctrine and it's essentially

500
00:30:54.131 --> 00:30:54.721
a Soviet,

501
00:30:54.721 --> 00:30:59.370
it's actually has one thing that before introducing some new technologies,

502
00:30:59.940 --> 00:31:03.540
a telecommunication companies should thoughts,
consultants,
a secret services.

503
00:31:03.720 --> 00:31:07.790
And we knew that that actually back in the Soviet times that destroyed the

504
00:31:07.800 --> 00:31:09.390
telecommunication market and our country.

505
00:31:09.600 --> 00:31:14.600
Because if you need to ask someone who is wise enough to think about security

506
00:31:15.090 --> 00:31:19.620
while it just slow down everything and that gives some,
yeah,
that gives us hope.

507
00:31:20.000 --> 00:31:21.650
<v 2>How does it give you hope?
That seems like a,</v>

508
00:31:21.870 --> 00:31:24.360
<v 3>well it's my,
no,
it's a,
it's a warning.</v>

509
00:31:24.390 --> 00:31:28.290
Tell him so bad that it would slow down z say internet business in our country.

510
00:31:28.320 --> 00:31:32.430
But in terms of Phi given the cow,
uh,
I'll uh,

511
00:31:32.431 --> 00:31:36.390
the forces of,
uh,
control some,
some new means.

512
00:31:36.420 --> 00:31:40.080
I think now the VA,
they're all this.
Um,

513
00:31:41.450 --> 00:31:45.220
uh,
I would say no for vitamins,

514
00:31:45.290 --> 00:31:47.940
just difficult to catch up phase all of this a bit slow.

515
00:31:48.140 --> 00:31:50.930
<v 2>I see.
It's a,
it's evidence that the mindset has not been evolving.</v>

516
00:31:51.010 --> 00:31:53.470
<v 3>Yup.
Got It.
When you've,
when you first,</v>

517
00:31:53.630 --> 00:31:56.550
then you need to choose what's the most important thing?

518
00:31:56.551 --> 00:31:59.920
Cause it's the forefront of technologies of security and you always to security.

519
00:32:00.350 --> 00:32:03.970
It means what?
You lose something very important that we live in a world when,

520
00:32:04.260 --> 00:32:05.570
when development of technologies,

521
00:32:05.600 --> 00:32:10.450
essential thing and if you all this trade it for security or for the ghost of

522
00:32:10.451 --> 00:32:11.410
security,
you lose.

523
00:32:11.570 --> 00:32:12.470
<v 2>Got It ready.
You can't,</v>

524
00:32:12.471 --> 00:32:15.860
it's not going to be viable to keep up with the international technology scene

525
00:32:15.861 --> 00:32:17.530
if that's the impression.
What do you think Eric?

526
00:32:18.090 --> 00:32:19.090
<v 0>Uh,
icings.</v>

527
00:32:19.230 --> 00:32:24.230
That crown is always losing to the technologies because it's crammed and doesn't

528
00:32:26.221 --> 00:32:28.570
understand the nature of the Internet.
And that was,

529
00:32:28.580 --> 00:32:32.160
that is very advantage as far as what if I go to the beacon mentors for us.

530
00:32:32.780 --> 00:32:32.901
<v 2>Well,</v>

531
00:32:32.901 --> 00:32:36.350
thank you so much for the work that you do for sharing it with us today and for

532
00:32:36.351 --> 00:32:40.010
taking the time to answer these questions.
And I'll it over now,
but let's do

533
00:32:40.010 --> 00:32:40.843
<v 3>a round of applause.</v>

534
00:32:46.580 --> 00:32:47.290
<v 1>Okay.</v>

535
00:32:47.290 --> 00:32:50.290
<v 4>Hi,
I'm,
so speaking of a digital sovereignty,
what's,</v>

536
00:32:50.470 --> 00:32:55.190
what are your thoughts and what's the sentiment coming out of Russia around the,

537
00:32:55.210 --> 00:33:00.210
the fake news phenomena that has essentially determine the elections of the u s

538
00:33:03.760 --> 00:33:08.760
<v 0>don't sense that a Russian Russians or Russian fake use determine that as a</v>

539
00:33:09.401 --> 00:33:10.800
result of the u s election.

540
00:33:10.810 --> 00:33:15.810
We believe as that is that Trump was elected because of a central reason sa,

541
00:33:16.780 --> 00:33:21.570
uh,
and the Americans wanted to believe him.
But of course,
uh,
uh,

542
00:33:22.450 --> 00:33:27.450
does this machine that produce fake news trolls and so on are to some extent the

543
00:33:28.250 --> 00:33:30.630
effective and a special ed and Tom Solve,

544
00:33:30.640 --> 00:33:35.430
disrupt and discussion on the Internet and to dissemination of our senior

545
00:33:35.530 --> 00:33:39.400
season.
Amanza Internet users.
What was the criminal,

546
00:33:41.130 --> 00:33:45.520
what does a motorcycle,
Rhonda of the Cram,
and there's this Arrow's I'm honest,

547
00:33:45.650 --> 00:33:50.650
I'm honest of trolls are spreading a negative information about Arizona,

548
00:33:51.101 --> 00:33:54.520
about,
uh,
about,
uh,
about Potter's,
about,
uh,

549
00:33:54.580 --> 00:33:59.080
representatives of different groups of pop off population about political

550
00:33:59.290 --> 00:34:02.120
leaders and post you,

551
00:34:02.400 --> 00:34:05.540
it puts you in a very vulnerable position.
You can't,
uh,

552
00:34:05.680 --> 00:34:09.280
you feel as though you can't believe anybody and so on.

553
00:34:09.281 --> 00:34:13.020
So it doesn't matter who will be your new president or maybe it's the old two

554
00:34:13.030 --> 00:34:16.670
old strong leader is better than any new leader.

555
00:34:17.030 --> 00:34:19.930
That's what was that?
What was I doing?

556
00:34:19.931 --> 00:34:23.880
What I see is that the kind of Poles,
I mean democracy,

557
00:34:24.220 --> 00:34:29.110
Tanner Paul's does this sinks on developing a good,
uh,

558
00:34:29.200 --> 00:34:31.570
good.
Our mass media,

559
00:34:31.900 --> 00:34:36.900
good quality and the progressive mass media also does the way how it could be,

560
00:34:37.570 --> 00:34:41.440
how we can combat the sink propaganda.

561
00:34:42.320 --> 00:34:43.090
<v 3>Maybe it's a fingers,</v>

562
00:34:43.090 --> 00:34:46.240
which we need to understand that this all started in our country.

563
00:34:46.300 --> 00:34:50.380
And a first layer as a first target was the Russian political opposition and

564
00:34:50.381 --> 00:34:51.340
independent journalism.

565
00:34:51.820 --> 00:34:56.470
And unfortunately it was very successful in Russia,

566
00:34:56.740 --> 00:35:01.740
mostly because we still are very confused society post Soviet Post authoritarian

567
00:35:02.201 --> 00:35:06.310
society.
I'll be for lack of trust in anything,

568
00:35:06.311 --> 00:35:10.510
especially in political institutions.
And that's who,
and it lets you,

569
00:35:10.540 --> 00:35:12.000
when you think of it,
you,

570
00:35:12.160 --> 00:35:15.950
it left you with the idea what you have the general public,
uh,

571
00:35:15.951 --> 00:35:19.930
as a population and the leader and that's all,
nothing in between.

572
00:35:20.440 --> 00:35:24.550
And that's,
that's what's used by buys a crime to the fool because of this case.

573
00:35:24.910 --> 00:35:29.670
While you think,
well at least he's guy,
he's strong enough.
We know who he,

574
00:35:29.710 --> 00:35:32.320
who he is and we do not know all of the guys.

575
00:35:32.440 --> 00:35:36.760
So it's better to keep the fish guy and it looks like push and just tried to,

576
00:35:37.370 --> 00:35:41.670
this idea of complete distrust in institutions.
Does the United States,

577
00:35:41.790 --> 00:35:45.900
I do not believe that it was born.
It was invented by Putin here.

578
00:35:45.901 --> 00:35:50.040
I mean you already had some basis for this kind of mistrust and and in,

579
00:35:50.041 --> 00:35:51.660
in the establishment and the media.

580
00:35:51.810 --> 00:35:55.650
So what they tried to do with trying to explore it with filling edits on fool

581
00:35:56.220 --> 00:36:00.990
and unfortunately it was successful to some to some degree.

582
00:36:01.060 --> 00:36:02.690
I,
I as a journalist,

583
00:36:02.700 --> 00:36:06.670
I'm a bit skeptical whether it's completely changes the game and,

584
00:36:06.800 --> 00:36:08.220
but of course we had a softball.

585
00:36:08.570 --> 00:36:10.100
<v 2>So if I'm hearing you right,
just to summarize,</v>

586
00:36:10.130 --> 00:36:14.930
it was as much about changing the level of overall trust in our society over a

587
00:36:14.931 --> 00:36:18.350
long period of time as it wasn't about any particular election.

588
00:36:18.510 --> 00:36:19.343
<v 3>Yeah,
yeah.</v>

589
00:36:21.240 --> 00:36:23.490
<v 4>I have a question kind of along the same lines.</v>

590
00:36:23.790 --> 00:36:28.110
So I was at the Oxford Internet institute back in 2010 kind of studying the

591
00:36:28.111 --> 00:36:30.240
beginnings of computational propaganda.

592
00:36:30.510 --> 00:36:33.090
And today I have friends who are journalists at NBC,

593
00:36:33.091 --> 00:36:36.420
big news outlets who were being tasked with covering these types of things.

594
00:36:36.660 --> 00:36:39.840
And I get questions from them like,
is this actually real?

595
00:36:40.110 --> 00:36:42.960
And so considering that,
and this is their job.

596
00:36:43.440 --> 00:36:48.440
And so considering that you've seen this in Russia many times in terms of like

597
00:36:48.511 --> 00:36:50.010
disinformation campaigns,

598
00:36:50.250 --> 00:36:54.360
are there any trends that you've seen evolve in Russia that you think could make

599
00:36:54.361 --> 00:36:55.950
the leap to the u s

600
00:36:56.690 --> 00:36:58.940
<v 3>well,
to be honest,
it looks like the,</v>

601
00:36:59.810 --> 00:37:04.810
but it's thought that in the West and Venture 14 Moseley,
uh,

602
00:37:04.870 --> 00:37:07.820
and uh,
because of the annexation of Crimea.

603
00:37:08.270 --> 00:37:12.080
And firstly it was as if first tiger toss Ukraine and it was easier because we

604
00:37:12.081 --> 00:37:14.420
share the same language,
the same pursuit.
It says the same,

605
00:37:14.810 --> 00:37:19.810
a furious about how bar hold Wulfila buzzer worst and a and our history.

606
00:37:20.060 --> 00:37:23.570
So you can play the same tricks for the Russian and for Ukrainians.

607
00:37:24.180 --> 00:37:27.550
Then they tried something in a,
in eastern Europe,
uh,

608
00:37:27.650 --> 00:37:32.650
to some extent it was really successful once again because lots of people on

609
00:37:33.121 --> 00:37:37.820
this to Europe,
Phil a a bit,
I would say fooled by the West.

610
00:37:37.850 --> 00:37:42.100
They have a promise at the Lord and it was never delivered.
And um,

611
00:37:42.570 --> 00:37:45.140
find the limit.
Tried in engine United Kingdom.

612
00:37:45.141 --> 00:37:47.840
I've tried to the garden and they immediately got spot.

613
00:37:48.080 --> 00:37:52.700
So it was not a big success.
Um,
mostly for some language problems.
Uh,

614
00:37:52.701 --> 00:37:57.020
and of course it was mostly because people who back then the harder to do this

615
00:37:57.021 --> 00:37:58.140
kind of things.
Uh,

616
00:37:58.180 --> 00:38:01.220
we were Russians based in the same pitcher of milk and some other places,

617
00:38:01.430 --> 00:38:03.830
but unfortunately,
uh,

618
00:38:03.831 --> 00:38:07.150
it's evolved with time and now,
uh,

619
00:38:07.190 --> 00:38:11.360
it looks like they got some people based in these countries who are at his

620
00:38:11.380 --> 00:38:16.070
bottle natives so they know how to speak a how to on Bryce,

621
00:38:16.071 --> 00:38:18.890
the issues which are really important for this particular region of his

622
00:38:18.891 --> 00:38:23.210
particular district.
And they use this kind of thing still.

623
00:38:23.211 --> 00:38:28.130
I do not believe that it's that effective.
Uh,
but what makes ma'am,

624
00:38:29.050 --> 00:38:33.360
but to curl there,
uh,
about crucial,
uh,

625
00:38:33.410 --> 00:38:37.420
ends up Clemons propaganda Fang,
that we have this strange,

626
00:38:37.480 --> 00:38:40.030
I just think some of that,
to be head of the Russian bureaucracy,

627
00:38:40.090 --> 00:38:44.380
which is by definition is extremely slow and it's not on there.

628
00:38:44.380 --> 00:38:48.850
But for a ministry it's also about Russian television and it's also bots secret

629
00:38:48.851 --> 00:38:52.240
services to some degree.
But also we got informal actors.

630
00:38:52.300 --> 00:38:56.800
We have people who officially have nothing to do with the government.

631
00:38:57.070 --> 00:38:59.080
And,
uh,
at,
on the one hand,

632
00:38:59.081 --> 00:39:04.081
it gives the Kremlin as what we always could deny responsibility of what we do

633
00:39:04.360 --> 00:39:06.100
all the time.
But also it makes it,

634
00:39:06.101 --> 00:39:10.090
these groups much more flexible and adventurous because they,

635
00:39:10.540 --> 00:39:15.130
uh,
my legs,
a bureaucracy of it,
have a direct access,
does a crown done,

636
00:39:15.310 --> 00:39:18.490
and they can always ask,
look,
it's a file.
Fine.
We do that on my,

637
00:39:18.500 --> 00:39:20.470
the next day we can,
we can try this.

638
00:39:20.800 --> 00:39:24.790
So it's actually be I on the fifth of very flexible and adventurous,

639
00:39:24.791 --> 00:39:29.791
a community of people who are really committed to this fence because actually

640
00:39:30.011 --> 00:39:32.860
the risks are still very slow low from him.

641
00:39:34.230 --> 00:39:37.400
<v 2>So I guess the answer is it's gotten harder to tell.
Yup.</v>

642
00:39:38.870 --> 00:39:41.430
Anything you would add arena.
Yup.

643
00:39:41.580 --> 00:39:44.310
Anything you want to add to that please?

644
00:39:45.120 --> 00:39:47.920
<v 5>A somewhat ironic that a,
I think today is a buttons,</v>

645
00:39:47.921 --> 00:39:51.610
the 65th birthday and as an economist published this morning,

646
00:39:51.850 --> 00:39:55.810
he has no intention of,
uh,
uh,
stepping down as I think you pointed out.
Um,

647
00:39:55.811 --> 00:39:56.800
and of course this article,

648
00:39:56.801 --> 00:39:59.270
which is just this morning was of course talking about Nevada and yeah.

649
00:39:59.710 --> 00:40:04.300
And so I guess two parts of the question from your perspective is what is his

650
00:40:04.301 --> 00:40:08.680
future and why knees given how much an upper he's made,
particularly in the West,

651
00:40:08.681 --> 00:40:11.320
you know,
he's on 60 minutes,
a handful of times.

652
00:40:11.650 --> 00:40:15.910
So where is he going or is he not?
And then where,
because a lot of,

653
00:40:15.911 --> 00:40:19.690
I think what he's done has been to catalyze somewhat of the youth and

654
00:40:19.691 --> 00:40:21.130
millennials and younger people.

655
00:40:21.220 --> 00:40:24.070
So what role will younger people play in the next five years?

656
00:40:24.360 --> 00:40:26.960
<v 2>And actually it might even be worth just giving a bit of quick context for the</v>

657
00:40:26.961 --> 00:40:28.790
group on who he is and the work he's done.

658
00:40:29.070 --> 00:40:29.351
<v 0>No,</v>

659
00:40:29.351 --> 00:40:34.350
I knew opposition politician who as a new way of doing policy or politics and

660
00:40:34.351 --> 00:40:39.330
Russia,
uh,
him,
uh,
you know,
that are today in Russia,

661
00:40:39.690 --> 00:40:44.100
uh,
opposition politicians can now access to the chosen media,

662
00:40:44.340 --> 00:40:47.640
traditional mass media,
TV channels,
radio stations,

663
00:40:47.641 --> 00:40:52.120
and newspapers and webs that could use website because all,

664
00:40:52.200 --> 00:40:55.920
most of them aren't as a criminal's control or under the control of program and

665
00:40:55.921 --> 00:40:59.670
oligarchs.
So she started,
uh,
he started,

666
00:41:01.390 --> 00:41:04.920
he started to gain popularity,
are doing some songs on that.

667
00:41:05.160 --> 00:41:07.290
He set up his,
uh,
he,
uh,

668
00:41:07.710 --> 00:41:12.280
he set up a special channel on Youtube as,
and another channel on Youtube.

669
00:41:12.860 --> 00:41:16.080
Uh,
he started it.
In fact,

670
00:41:16.081 --> 00:41:20.900
he started with tweeters on Youtube Channel and,
uh,
until,
and his,
well,

671
00:41:20.940 --> 00:41:23.500
his own web sites.
And He,
uh,

672
00:41:23.820 --> 00:41:28.550
two years ago he got a lot of popularity that was even bigger are into Saul.

673
00:41:28.780 --> 00:41:33.550
It became bigger in 2017,
four.
I don't know what reasons may be,

674
00:41:33.630 --> 00:41:38.630
are maybe because of a financial crisis in Russia and a bad economic situation

675
00:41:39.741 --> 00:41:44.610
may be the cause or the authoritative regime became strong.

676
00:41:44.640 --> 00:41:48.510
Cousin was,
isn't it used to be,
but,
uh,

677
00:41:49.680 --> 00:41:53.360
he's [inaudible] are usually,
uh,

678
00:41:53.520 --> 00:41:58.340
usually regret of yours tends me,
uh,

679
00:41:59.270 --> 00:42:03.000
in fact tens of millions years and tens of millions of views because a single

680
00:42:03.001 --> 00:42:07.770
youtube video.
Yeah.
So that's great sale and oven oven the oven,

681
00:42:07.771 --> 00:42:10.830
we'll have a as a last mass protest and Moscow,
uh,

682
00:42:11.880 --> 00:42:15.370
was arrested but uh,
but uh,

683
00:42:16.400 --> 00:42:18.680
any case.
So we got a is our war,

684
00:42:20.900 --> 00:42:25.130
tens of thousands of people on the streets and many of them,
uh,

685
00:42:25.380 --> 00:42:29.960
the students and even I am in school,
boys at school goals is that as well?

686
00:42:30.230 --> 00:42:30.791
Is it as it as,

687
00:42:30.791 --> 00:42:35.791
it was really unusual for Russia because previously vi we've seen only on the

688
00:42:36.501 --> 00:42:38.600
people who's older than 20,

689
00:42:39.230 --> 00:42:42.210
<v 3>and maybe answering the question.
Um,</v>

690
00:42:42.500 --> 00:42:44.710
the interesting thing now is the bat,
uh,

691
00:42:44.750 --> 00:42:47.210
previously now I only base all his activity online.

692
00:42:47.240 --> 00:42:51.120
It was all this about something on line.
And right now he started building his,

693
00:42:51.200 --> 00:42:55.640
um,
his network offline and it's surprisingly,

694
00:42:55.641 --> 00:42:59.340
it's quiet successful.
Uh,
one regards,

695
00:42:59.380 --> 00:43:03.740
the light just protest and the one to try to organize and to enlist people in

696
00:43:03.741 --> 00:43:07.950
the regions.
And we got produce an 80 towns,
which is really 80,
80.

697
00:43:08.570 --> 00:43:10.170
So it's really big because,
uh,

698
00:43:10.171 --> 00:43:14.540
as a usual a Fiore and traditional fear about the Russian political opposition

699
00:43:14.541 --> 00:43:19.520
is like,
well,
yes,
you have some,
some people voting for you in big towns,

700
00:43:19.540 --> 00:43:20.540
but uh,

701
00:43:20.580 --> 00:43:24.770
the rest of Russia doesn't care and that they support [inaudible] it's not the

702
00:43:24.771 --> 00:43:25.660
case.
Now it's a,

703
00:43:25.670 --> 00:43:30.670
it's a big new development and I think he will invest more and more resources

704
00:43:30.741 --> 00:43:34.890
and more of his time and his people time into trying to build is math.

705
00:43:34.890 --> 00:43:37.970
What can regions,
and it's,
as I said,
that's quite effective.

706
00:43:38.000 --> 00:43:41.660
It's really interesting what might happen to him and to his ideas when he

707
00:43:41.930 --> 00:43:45.980
actually started with moving is shift from on from the online,

708
00:43:45.981 --> 00:43:50.000
the wall to the offline world.
Of course we have some problems,
uh,

709
00:43:50.030 --> 00:43:53.930
because it's means it's a very traditional way of building a political party,

710
00:43:53.931 --> 00:43:58.880
which means what you need to be ready to answer some traditional wow question is

711
00:43:58.881 --> 00:44:01.490
like what you're thinking about the economic situation,

712
00:44:01.491 --> 00:44:05.610
political situation on and now Crimea,
many things and he is not bad.

713
00:44:05.630 --> 00:44:09.470
[inaudible] uh,
and,
but still it's a very simple

714
00:44:09.550 --> 00:44:12.540
<v 0>functional adds a woman.
He's in the,
and Santa was,
uh,</v>

715
00:44:12.541 --> 00:44:17.390
was the tainted I took two days ago,
four foot for 20 days.
Hmm.

716
00:44:18.310 --> 00:44:20.430
Thank you.
Awesome.

717
00:44:21.180 --> 00:44:23.490
<v 6>In the beginning of your talk,
you mentioned that,
um,</v>

718
00:44:23.880 --> 00:44:27.630
there are very few things that could resonate with the general public when it

719
00:44:27.660 --> 00:44:29.650
comes to censorship.
Um,

720
00:44:30.060 --> 00:44:34.650
do you feel there is a cultural shift happening and brushed brushing society

721
00:44:34.651 --> 00:44:38.030
where people's starting to respect,
uh,

722
00:44:39.120 --> 00:44:43.050
freedom of speech more?
Or is it still mostly about just,
you know,

723
00:44:43.080 --> 00:44:44.600
accessing to deterrence and,

724
00:44:44.700 --> 00:44:48.740
and for Nagaffi this is one thing and another thing they topic of,
um,

725
00:44:49.760 --> 00:44:52.110
talk to day surveillance,
censorship and beyond.

726
00:44:52.111 --> 00:44:54.330
And I wanted to ask you a little bit about the beyond part.

727
00:44:54.660 --> 00:44:58.410
Do you feel like part of this strategy of the government when it comes to

728
00:44:58.411 --> 00:44:59.220
censorship,

729
00:44:59.220 --> 00:45:04.220
censorship is to make the community complacent with it and doing it through the

730
00:45:06.630 --> 00:45:11.220
idea of,
um,
censorship being necessary to,

731
00:45:11.280 --> 00:45:14.280
to control,
to food,
to control the country,

732
00:45:14.281 --> 00:45:17.310
to fight terrorism and to make sure we,

733
00:45:17.730 --> 00:45:19.410
it was Russia grows in a stable fashion.

734
00:45:20.100 --> 00:45:23.860
<v 3>Well,
I would try to,
it's actually the interesting thing about,
uh,</v>

735
00:45:24.140 --> 00:45:27.710
there is a way to answer both of your question and one,
uh,

736
00:45:27.760 --> 00:45:31.960
it looks like five years ago when they introduced the system,

737
00:45:31.961 --> 00:45:35.240
we're trying to play some tricks like we are protecting children.
Uh,

738
00:45:35.320 --> 00:45:37.030
we are doing things.
We actually,

739
00:45:37.031 --> 00:45:40.590
we just doing this exactly the same thing that was first introduced by some

740
00:45:40.600 --> 00:45:41.230
British.

741
00:45:41.230 --> 00:45:45.220
So in a way we imitates a British approach to internet filter in and it looks

742
00:45:45.221 --> 00:45:47.560
like some years ago,
actually two years ago,

743
00:45:47.561 --> 00:45:50.290
they completely abandoning all pretenses.

744
00:45:50.620 --> 00:45:55.240
Now it's even not about terrorist,
it's about the west.
We have the west,

745
00:45:55.510 --> 00:45:58.960
they are plotting against us.
If we need to fight back,
we need to protect us.

746
00:45:59.320 --> 00:45:59.861
And the,

747
00:45:59.861 --> 00:46:04.861
unfortunately his visa idea is accepted by many and evens.

748
00:46:06.281 --> 00:46:10.030
Um,
idea,
salt,
fog,
completer,
shuffle off.

749
00:46:10.040 --> 00:46:15.040
Our infrastructure in our country is a sort of accepted by many because as the

750
00:46:15.131 --> 00:46:19.420
Internet is seen as a invention as Americans,
so we need to fight back,

751
00:46:19.421 --> 00:46:23.650
very installed.
For example,
that it was a crazy story just two years ago.

752
00:46:23.910 --> 00:46:24.530
Uh,

753
00:46:24.530 --> 00:46:29.110
how's the idea of the localization was sold to Russia?

754
00:46:29.370 --> 00:46:33.650
Uh,
some,
some Russian officials,
uh,
sat on from the stage of,

755
00:46:33.730 --> 00:46:38.510
actually you can see in Crimea,
some of the people are playing,
uh,

756
00:46:38.770 --> 00:46:41.890
Vulcraft.
They've bowel the VA,

757
00:46:42.370 --> 00:46:47.370
they know they're not a capable of playing because they are couple far as

758
00:46:49.070 --> 00:46:52.610
Americans.
So we need to do something about it.
And then this kind of protects,

759
00:46:52.990 --> 00:46:56.920
well,
unfortunately,
are quite popular and people accepted this idea.

760
00:46:57.640 --> 00:46:59.780
<v 0>Second,
second class towns.
Oh,
of course.</v>

761
00:46:59.781 --> 00:47:03.290
My sense is that it's all a start to the new Samsung Samsung,

762
00:47:03.530 --> 00:47:07.650
a nonpolitical like thorns websites on pornography and eh,

763
00:47:07.700 --> 00:47:10.870
and Eh,
shifted very,

764
00:47:10.940 --> 00:47:13.900
very soon to politics because costs,
uh,

765
00:47:13.980 --> 00:47:17.300
the cause to block pop pornography websites is also politics.

766
00:47:17.630 --> 00:47:18.560
It's so instruction.

767
00:47:19.190 --> 00:47:20.680
<v 3>Um,
thank you all again.
Thank you.</v>
